Text: "I heard him before I saw him: \"Signorina! You, the one who\u2019s getting\
  \ wet!\" It was a mime \u2013 festooned in pantaloons and buckled shoes, wearing\
  \ a bouffant Baroque wig, painted gold.\n\nThis was December 2005. Rome. La Fontana\
  \ di Trevi. I'd missed my overnight train to Paris and there wouldn't be another\
  \ one for six hours. I knew no one in Rome and had nothing to do, so I'd taken a\
  \ cab to La Fontana di Trevi where as soon as I'd set foot in front of the massive\
  \ marble fountain, the skies had opened and unleashed hell. Hence my getting wet.\
  \ Hence, my chilly reply: \"Mimes aren't supposed to talk\".\n\nCasanova was Polish,\
  \ loved Americans, and was now officially off-mime duty: \"I\u2019ll buy you a coffee.\
  \ C\u2019mon, signorina \u2013 what else are you going to do for six hours in the\
  \ rain?\" The golden man had a point. He pulled out a bag from behind a marble column\
  \ and we went to a caf\xE9 around the corner \u2013 espresso for him; hot chocolate\
  \ for me. Passerby gaped at us through the wet windows.\n\nQ: So what does one talk\
  \ about with a mime, anyway?\n\nA: SEX. Who knew? The mime took his role as Casanova\
  \ seriously: \"I live nearby, signorina. We'll go to my place. But why not? I\u2019\
  m Casanova; no woman can resist! The things I'll do to you...\" His fingers stroked\
  \ his spoon and cup suggestively, leaving gold traces. I looked longingly at the\
  \ door \u2013 still raining, still hours before my train. \n\nThen, an exclamation\
  \ point zoomed off the top of his wig: \"I know why you won't come home with me,\
  \ signorina.\"\n\n\"Because I don't know you?\"\n\n\"No, signorina. It's because\
  \ you can't imagine making love to someone gold. But I'll change out of my costume.\
  \ Then you\u2019ll see.\"\n\n\"See what?\"\n\n\"The real man who will make love\
  \ to you.\" he paused. \"Darius.\" He grabbed his bag and disappeared into the bathroom.\
  \ \n\nTwenty minutes later, the real Darius emerged \u2013 scrubbed clean, with\
  \ a shaved head and wearing a black sweater. But, like Samson, Darius wasn\u2019\
  t so confident without his Casanova wig. Now he only sat silently before me, shredding\
  \ his napkin. Gone were the come-ons. Gone were the brash \"signorinas\". Gone was\
  \ the cocksure grin.\n\nThe bar clock ticked. The clinking of metal spoons. The\
  \ whirr of the espresso machine. \n\nFinally, Darius said: \"I guess I\u2019ll go\
  \ home.\"\n\nHe paid our check. He disappeared into the rain.\n\nI moved to Italy\
  \ full-time five years later and every time I pass La Fontana di Trevi I look for\
  \ that caf\xE9. Just like Casanova - and, with him, Darius's sexual confidence -\
  \ it seems to have vanished."
