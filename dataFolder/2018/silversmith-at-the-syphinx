Text: "How did the New Mexican Silversmith end up under a full moon climbing the famous\
  \ Sphinx.\nIt started by getting late to Cairo on New Tear and bored with the silvery\
  \ trees and baubles left from Cheistmas. Outside, a slight man Farraj and his young\
  \ cousin asked if we wanted to see the Pyramids as he has a cousin who was the main\
  \ guard and they would let us in. Skeptical,I said we will be robbed for sure. The\
  \ Silversmith who had come to Egygt to look at design ideas and start to work in\
  \ gold with lapis and was very excited to go on this dangerous taxi ride. Normally\
  \ I had gone with friends riding from nearby village over the deep sand and end\
  \ up there but there still would be tourists and evening shows with dancing music\
  \ food. He insisted so went with him heading out to Giza. When we arrived after\
  \ a series of whistles and exchanges of cigarettes, the cousin suggested we climb\
  \ up to the Sphinx. it was quiet except for the wind. No horses no tourists, just\
  \ silence.The guards smoked and chatted. A Kid appeared with an artifact to sell.\
  \ No, I said come on one hundred pounds? But the Silversmitj thrilled to be there\
  \ paid him exactly that. He would later carry it in his backpack around the world\
  \ and hone and no one Apparently. No one ever asked. So the cousin, the kid, and\
  \ the Silversmith really were climbing on an ancient wonder. Thinking this was a\
  \ dreadful idea on many levels. I called to him to not do it. \nOut of the night\
  \ I thought I saw a very old man on a grey horse. They watched in the moonlight\
  \ and the cousin suddenly stopped and everyone came down. Fast.\nWe were told we\
  \ have to go. Immediately. The rider raised his hand in a type of salute. We piled\
  \ in and the car slipping in the sand went backwards very fast. We made it to the\
  \ road. \nSuddenly a coonvot of military vehicles rushed by . The cousin was terrified\
  \ to see this but kept going until we re-entered Cairo.\nWho  was the old man? No\
  \ one said anything. On a horse.? \nThere was no one on a horse, said the cousin.\
  \ My brother said we had to go or we would be caught.\nThe Silversmith looked at\
  \ me. Did you see that guy on the horse? It looked white.\nI don't know,I said.\
  \  I just don't know."
