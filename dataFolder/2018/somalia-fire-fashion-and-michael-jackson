Text: "1-Gunmen as fashion models \nA group of three gunmen with bullet-belts around\
  \ their waists was the first scary image I had seen after our plane landed in Mogadishu\
  \ airport. The gunmen were waiting for my team to act as \u201Cour guards\u201D\
  \ during our work in Mogadishu. We were told that we can\u2019t move without having\
  \ guards \u201CIt is extremely dangerous, guys\u201D one politician tells us. The\
  \ gunmen were guarding us from only one side. They were sitting in the back of our\
  \ car, what means that if we are attacked from the front side, they would be useless.\
  \ \nAs our car was moving in the streets of Mogadishu, I was able to notice the\
  \ numerous numbers of gunmen sitting in the backs of cars \u201Cguarding people\
  \ inside\u201D. With this big numbers of gunmen, one can expect war or at least\
  \ a Hollywood-style gang wars. But nothing happened.  All the back-cars gunmen were\
  \ always calm, silent, and just raising their hands to send silent greeting to other\
  \ back-car gunmen. \nFollowing the civil war in the 1980s and later, big numbers\
  \ of farmers and workers turned to hold weapons to defend themselves against attackers,\
  \ thieves, and tribal conflict. After decades, holding weapons has become a source\
  \ of income and working as gunmen has become a job. \nThe Mr. Employer is, in fact,\
  \ the politicians who used to hire those gunmen to work as \u201Cguards\u201D. They\
  \ teach them how to press the fire shutter, to stay calm, and silent. Just like\
  \ a fashion model whose only job is to wear expensive cloths. They have no idea\
  \ about the mechanism or the process of making these cloths. They can\u2019t even\
  \ afford their prices, but their job is to hold them and show up in a calm and silent\
  \ mode. \n\n2- Aisha and Michael Jackson \nAisha is a 14-year old Somali girl I\
  \ met and had to inform her with worst news she wanted to hear.\n\u201Chave you\
  \ heard about that model appeared in the Michael Jackson\u2019s clip?\u201D Aisha\
  \ asked.\nAnd I replied: \u201Cwhich one? Oh yeah, Eman, Yeah\u201D. \u201CShe is\
  \ Somali. I tried to contact her\nbut I couldn\u2019t. Do you her telephone number?\u201D\
  \ Aisha said.\nIn fact I tried also to contact that famous model to host her in\
  \ my documentary, but just like\nAisha I couldn\u2019t and I finally could I gave\
  \ up when I believed that Eman is not the real story of\nSomalis. It was obvious\
  \ that I only wanted her because she is a public figure from a Somali\norigin.\n\
  Me: why did you want to contact Eman?\nAisha: to make me meet Michael Jackson.\n\
  Me: Michael Jackson! Why?\nAisha: I wanted to be a model like her. \nMe: Michael\
  \ Jackson is dead now anyway."
