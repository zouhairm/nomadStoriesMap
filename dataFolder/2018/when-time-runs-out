Text: "They say when we are old, we rarely regret the things we did, but rather the\
  \ chances we didn't take. We always thinks there's more time. What happens however\
  \ when that time runs out? When the last grain of sand in our hour glass falls?\
  \ Can we say now, with certainty : I lived my best and most happy life? \n\nIn November\
  \ 2016, I was sitting at my desk, flipping through Facebook and chatting with a\
  \ coworker. Out of nowhere, there it was : a picture of my dad. My older brother,\
  \ had no idea that the network at my job had been down all day and that all my calls\
  \ had gone directly to voicemail. Before I could stop myself, I tearfully blurted\
  \ out \"My dad just died!\" I literally run out of my office to confirm that my\
  \ worst nightmare was indeed true. It was. So we buried my dad in England - one\
  \ week before Christmas. \n\nThe holidays seemed to come even though my world was\
  \ in chaos. It's funny how that happens. I ushered in the New Year crying into a\
  \ glass of champagne, then spent the next few months battling the depths of my depression.\
  \ Six months after burying my dad, I was divorced. \n\nHaving had two major life\
  \ events happen in under six months, I desperately needed release. I finally booked\
  \ the girls weekend that my best friend and I had been planning for over five years.\
  \ The trip was perfect. My gypsy soul began stretching and yawning herself awake,\
  \ hungry for more. When tragedy strikes, we go through shock, but then acceptance\
  \ brings us into a state of \"new normal\". \n\nI was in \"new normal\" for months\
  \ without realizing it. As the holidays came again, the universe sent me another\
  \ bold reminder, right on queue.  Three days before Christmas 2017, my friend tragically\
  \ lost her 11 year old daughter. Our daughters had been born just 10 short days\
  \ apart. I'll never forget hearing her say \"I did CPR - it just wasn't enough.\
  \ She took her last breath with my hands still working on her!\".  Time had run\
  \ out for that sweet little girl, again reminding me of the frailty of life. \n\n\
  Within one week of getting that news, I had  booked trips to nine countries on my\
  \ bucket list and started contemplating a travel blog. It took me two months to\
  \ quiet my nerves. On my 40th birthday in February, I finally took the plunge and\
  \ started my own travel page on Facebook when I took my first trip to Bermuda -\
  \ a trip 15 years in the making.  Having had time tragically run out on me twice,\
  \ I had finally gotten the message the universe was trying to teach: LIVE before\
  \ time runs out on you too."
