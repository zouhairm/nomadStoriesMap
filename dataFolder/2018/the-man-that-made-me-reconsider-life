Text: "It was a sunny day, my breath was lost amongst the white snowy mountains. It\
  \ was cold, but my blood was drowned in adrenaline. I took my first step forward\
  \ and suddenly my ski couch held me and said, Dorrin you\u2019re late! Just before\
  \ I had a chance to speak he said, I  you\u2019re still scared of steep slopes so\
  \ I\u2019ve organised for you to go with Markus. \n\nI turned around Markus was\
  \ standing there talk. He waved at me. I was not impressed that I was with beginners.\
  \ But long before I got a choice to say anything the other group had left. \nAround\
  \ lunch time, I found myself next to Markus with another friend of mine, already\
  \ unexpressed about the situation and i was expecting a conversation about mountains,\
  \  considering he was a mountain boy. He began his conversation by asking me about\
  \ my home country. His obsession and knowledge for travel and people was intriguing.\
  \ \n\nAt the last day of classes he invited a bunch of us for hot wine, some of\
  \ us went. Once the wines were sipped  in the beautiful white and fluffy snow fall,\
  \ me and Markus were now left alone talking, smoking and drinking wine. Religion,\
  \ world, the environment, it did help that I just had an argument to a friend of\
  \ mine about how unevnvironmentallg friendly he is. Markus reassured me that I wasn\u2019\
  t wrong and he said, people like to make their own mistake, they are selfish, we\
  \ all are. If you can only change you for the better that would count as the biggest\
  \ contribution to the universe. You\u2019re only as small as a flying atom among\
  \ the greatness of the universe. I turned around, and for some reason I just couldn\u2019\
  t say a word, I stared at his eyes for a while before I looked away with rosy cheeks\
  \ thinking to myself. But my boyfriend, why can\u2019t I have these conversations\
  \ with him and why am I so god damn attracted to this gorgeous blue eyed Austrian.\
  \ I looked away wiped on my wine. Markus went to get another. The lady across from\
  \ me that we were sharing a table with outside in the snow. She said with broken\
  \ English I see fire! I said you\u2019re wrong, I have a boyfriend. Then she said,\
  \ then you\u2019re playing with fire. The next day Markus called. We spend the day\
  \ lost in the long white snow, thirsty for a kiss, I knew I would love this man\
  \ and I knew once I leave the day after I may never see him again. We smoked some\
  \ weed and kept quiet before we said goodbye that night. The kiss that I did not\
  \ give that man is now the biggest regret of my life. If only I didn\u2019t have\
  \ to be an adult with responsibilities."
