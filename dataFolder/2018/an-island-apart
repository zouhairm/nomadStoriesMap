Text: "I met Rob at his tourism kiosk on my way to the beach to solicit a cold beer\
  \ and something to eat. He called across the street as I walked past. Normally I\
  \ would have greeted a strange man politely in return and continued en route to\
  \ imminent ingestion of food, but I sat with him on a whim. \nRob has thick curly\
  \ hair that he grows long. Melanin clouds the whites of his eyes, though his outlook\
  \ on life is unblemished; relaxed and joyous, imbued with a light heartedness that\
  \ I find commonly in people with little material wealth. He has a taciturn manner,\
  \ a quiet but charming self-confidence, and a permanent awry smile that stretches\
  \ to a grin when he finds humour in his words or in others\u2019, which is often.\
  \ \nHe suggested that we go to a market to eat satay ayam and fried plantain. We\
  \ sat on the roadside to watch the hubbub of the evening playing out in the square.\
  \ I began to question the authenticity of my chicken skewers as I picked bone fragments\
  \ out of mouthfuls. \nAs he fed himself, I noticed that Rob\u2019s left arm was\
  \ deformed. It didn\u2019t strike me as inhibitory though, and as if he could see\
  \ what I was thinking he flashed a white grin, \u201CI am lucky.\u201D \nI was struck\
  \ by his humility. His no-bother manner so gracefully defied the Western tendency\
  \ to define a person by their physical form. \n\"You know I never felt different.\
  \ In your country it seems like you don't have to be deformed to feel a kind of\
  \ alienation. Perhaps the worst kind is in the mind.\"\nWe talked about our childhoods\
  \ and about life in our respective countries. I told him that I planned to ride\
  \ north to seek the spaciousness of the black sand beaches. He asked candidly about\
  \ the heartbreak that I carry, and if I am escaping problems with an ex. I blushed,\
  \ unaware that I was so transparent. \u201CYour eyes that tell me, even though you\
  \ don't speak it,\u201D he said.\n\u201CSo do you want a foreign boyfriend?\u201D\
  \nI laugh and meet his gaze, narrowing mine, probing for his real intent. The unpretentiousness\
  \ of the Indonesian people is not lost on me.\nPermeated by smoke from the cooking\
  \ fires and satiated after a second serve of fried plantain, I walked to my homestay\
  \ along the beach, watching young locals frolicking in the still, dark water of\
  \ the sea under a cuticle moon, and relishing the odours of lives lived open to\
  \ the street, open to the world. I retired to my bed sheltered by a gloriously impermeable\
  \ mosquito net, feeling grateful for it and for its contrast to the unguarded sincerity\
  \ of the Floresian people."
