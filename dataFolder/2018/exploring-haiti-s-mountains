Text: "Rain comes in droves as my hosts and I round our way out of Port-au-Prince\
  \ and into the mountains that barricade the Haitian capital, our 4x4 clambering\
  \ up the inconsistently unkempt road, seemingly the only one ever built in Haiti,\
  \ and the mountain acting as a literal class divide.\nThe inconsistently unkempt\
  \ road turns to inconsistently elevated dirt reminiscent of the sweet potato and\
  \ marshmallow concoction Americans gorge themselves on at Thanksgiving. The sweet\
  \ potato road turns to orange goop in the wake of unrelenting rain, and it gets\
  \ goopier as the road narrows, barely big enough for two vehicles. \nWe enter the\
  \ village of Furcy, a mountaintop haven for those looking for a respite from the\
  \ complex cacophony that is Port-au-Prince. It's quieter, though still lively, like\
  \ a Midwestern college town on a Thursday night. Our destination is Rustik, a treehouse\
  \ hostel and bar catering to Haitians and hipsters alike.\n\nMade completely of\
  \ recycled wood and empty liquor bottles, the place seems like one of those you\
  \ either adore or detest, a feeling that can be attributed to all of Port-au-Prince.\
  \ Situated at the top of a mountain with tentacles stretching out into the valley\
  \ below, the Rustik is the perfect spring break hangout for adventurous college\
  \ students or voyeuristic couples who prefer to sleep in a treehouse with only a\
  \ curtain providing privacy.\n\nAfter a few cheap Haitian menthols that aren't actually\
  \ Haitian but pretend to be, we wander aimlessly through Furcy, reveling in the\
  \ juxtaposition of the vibrant Haitian hibiscus flowers growing between razor wire\
  \ lined walls.\n\nTo me, this is Haiti: a beautiful, exceedingly friendly nation\
  \ that's teeming with life and hospitality and battling the worst of mankind's demons.\
  \ The razorwire, surely a holdout from the military dictatorships of the 80s and\
  \ the successive coups against democratically elected presidents, is rusting and\
  \ being slowly enveloped by flowers and other greenery.\n\nOur wandering comes to\
  \ a close and we all huddle into the 4x4 that will either serve as my savior or\
  \ grave coming down the mountain. There is no photography for me on the way down,\
  \ only contemplation, the occasional \"Bonjou,\" to passerby, and a certainty my\
  \ passport will hold many more Haitian stamps by the time it's retired."
