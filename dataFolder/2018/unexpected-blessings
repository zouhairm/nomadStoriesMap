Text: "I traveled to Kona, Hawaii for the first time last year. It has always been\
  \ my number one dream destination. However, I thought I would have to wait until\
  \ retirement in order to afford it. But thanks to Divine Intervention and a friend's\
  \ generosity, I was able to experience an affordable dream vacation. The opportunity\
  \ basically fell into my lap unexpectedly. I logged onto Facebook one morning and\
  \ the very first post I read was from my friend stating that she was going to Hawaii\
  \ and wanted some company. I just happened to be at the right place at the right\
  \ time which is why I say there was a Higher Power involved because I could have\
  \ just as easily slept in and missed the greatest opportunity of my entire life.\
  \ \n\nI figured I would have an enjoyable vacation but I thought life would go on\
  \ as always when I returned home. Hawaii touched my heart in ways I never imagined\
  \ and changed my life beyond my wildest dreams. In fact, I cried multiple times\
  \ when I returned home. I have been back from Hawaii for nearly a year and much\
  \ to my surprise; life still has not returned to \u201Cnormal\u201D. This is a reality\
  \ that I was not prepared to experience. \n\nHawaii is legally a state but it was\
  \ once a sovereign nation whose traditions are still very much alive.  The culture\
  \ is laid back and carefree. The spirit of Aloha is everywhere and it is truly magical.\
  \ It truly left me speechless. I learned that appreciating and respecting another\
  \ culture did not take anything away from me. Instead, it added another dimension\
  \ to my life that did not previously exist. It made my world bigger and expanded\
  \ my sphere of influence. Experiences are more valuable than material possesions\
  \ because no one can take them away. \n\nI have lived in Chattanooga, Tennessee\
  \ my entire life and I have always been proud of my Anglo-Celtic heritage. My southern\
  \ roots run deep. However, I learned to appreciate the Polynesian culture. Hawaiians\
  \ take great pride in their ancestral heritage too. It is remarkable how people\
  \ can be so vastly different and yet strikingly similar. Travel is the vehicle by\
  \ which many cultures intersect and come together in the spirit of unity without\
  \ uniformity. We have everything to gain and nothing to lose by embracing and accepting\
  \ the beautiful differences of other cultures. There is so much to learn when we\
  \ allow ourselves to grow by visiting and experiencing different cultures. Everything\
  \ I experienced had a profound impact on my worldview. I will never forget it as\
  \ long as I live."
