Text: "The small boat zoomed across water so crystal clear I almost felt bad disturbing\
  \ it. When we anchored, I looked to one side and saw see crystal blue water sparkling\
  \ with the rays of the sun, and to the other was a dark blue abyss. We were at \u201C\
  The Wall,\u201D as the islanders called it; this was where the island dropped off\
  \ rather suddenly creating a stark contrast between the light blue of the island\
  \ water and the dark blue of the Atlantic Ocean. \n I wiggled my feet into the flippers,\
  \ shimmied the snorkel mask over my face, and then jumped into the inviting water.\
  \ I floated along looking at the amazing scenery beneath me; I had been transported\
  \ to a whole new world. Through the blue, fish of all different shapes, sizes, and\
  \ colors swam right by me, completely unbothered by the fact something fifty times\
  \ their size was swimming with them. It was like swimming around in a treasure chest,\
  \ the colorful fish looked like jewels and gemstones floating through the crystal\
  \ blue water. \n Among all of the unbelievable color before me, I saw something\
  \ out of the corner of my eye. About twenty feet below me was a huge sea turtle,\
  \ swimming on the border between the reef and the open ocean. It was just swimming\
  \ along, oblivious to everything going on above him. He just swam along, and it\
  \ was mesmerizing. \n In that moment, all thoughts of the wonderfully vibrant fish\
  \ left my mind and without quite realizing what I was doing, I started swimming\
  \ too. I swam and I swam, never taking my eyes off of the most free and peaceful\
  \ creature I\u2019ve ever seen. I felt like I could swim the whole ocean. I felt\
  \ free and I felt at peace.\n After an indiscernible amount of time, I realized\
  \ I was no longer swimming above the reef. I reluctantly said a silent goodbye and\
  \ thank you to the sea turtle and brought myself back to the surface. I couldn\u2019\
  t see the boat clearly; I began to swim back towards what I could only hope was\
  \ the boat. The swim back seemed a lot longer without the intense feelings of peace\
  \ and freedom the turtle had brought me. However, after swimming for a little while,\
  \ I began to imagine the turtle again and the feeling of peaceful freedom came back\
  \ to me again. I made it back to the boat to the worried but relived chastisements\
  \ from my family because apparently, I had swum over a mile from the boat; but,\
  \ they couldn\u2019t understand why. I\u2019ve never felt such true freedom before\
  \ or after that; but I do know that after experiencing it, all I\u2019ve ever wanted\
  \ to do is chase that feeling."
