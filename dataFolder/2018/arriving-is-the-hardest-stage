  \n\nThe plane lands roughly onto the ground, the ground of a foreign country. A\
  \ ground that\u2019s pushing me so far out my comfort zone, I begin to doubt myself.\
  \ I wonder if I can make it through the weekend. However daunting, I smile as I\
  \ see my friend sitting next to me. \"At least you didn\u2019t journey alone,\"\
  \ I think.\n\nAfter the exhausting wait in the intense heat at the understaffed\
  \ Customs, I\u2019m finally here. Finally earned my first passport stamp, the many\
  \ to hopefully come. A generous airport worker offers to carry our bags with his\
  \ cart. I oblige even though I could handle it myself. While leaving the airport,\
  \ I\u2019m stopped by the community. They\u2019re speaking in a language I don\u2019\
  t understand and trying to gesture. I\u2019m confused. Obviously I need to stop\
  \ and do something, but what? Finally after seeing another person\u2019s actions,\
  \ I realize the bag I\u2019m holding needs to be put through the metal detector.\
  \ \"Odd, never had to do that back home,\" I think. However I do as they say and\
  \ carry on.\n\nWe stop to exchange dollars for Colombian pesos and hope they\u2019\
  re honest and give the right amount. Taxis wait outside the airport and we get inside.\
  \ The generous man is in the window, hand out, waiting for the tip.\n\n\"Oh shoot\
  \ I didn\u2019t even think about that,\" I mutter. Back home I always carry my luggage\
  \ out. There\u2019s no generous people carrying bags for tips. I look down at the\
  \ money in my hand, not quite sure yet what is worth what. I quickly google and\
  \ realize the smallest bill is still  a rather large tip. With a sigh, I hand it\
  \ over. What else can I do?\n\nAirport mission cleared, we are off to find our hotel.\
  \ With broken Spanish and mostly English, I try to communicate with the driver where\
  \ to go and luckily he understands. Well, I hope he does. Whipping through traffic\
  \ of bikes and tiny cars, we arrive at our hotel, across the street from a small\
  \ beach. I carry my luggage out while my friend handles the high tip to the driver.\
  \ \"We need to break these big bills,\" I think to myself.\n\nWe wait at the front\
  \ desk until it\u2019s our turn. A nice lady greets us and I attempt to convey my\
  \ name and the intent to check in. Back and forth we go until I resolve any payment\
  \ issues and obtain the keys.\n\n\u201CGracias,\u201D I say, and depart for the\
  \ elevator. We manage to find the room, the tiny room with just enough space without\
  \ feeling like a closet, and plop down on the comfy bed. \n\nSomehow we\u2019ve\
  \ conquered the arrival stage."
