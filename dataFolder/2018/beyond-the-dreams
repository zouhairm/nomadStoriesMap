Text: 'My travel story is about my first solo trip around Scotland. I''m going to
  talk about the last thing I expected to discover and feel there. It was an unforgetable
  experience which mark me for the rest of my life, the way that my spirit felt that
  day was amusing, my heartbeat goes out of my chest.


  I can remind perfectly how nervous and scared was I afetr landing in Edimburgh at
  1 o clock in the morning, lost and out of your comfort zone. But with the first
  daylight, I began watching everything like an adveture and, with the pass of the
  days, I enjoyed the best trip I have ever done until the date.


  This place gave me the peace and freadom I needed. I left Spain looking for new
  experiences, cultures and places to inspire myself, and the landscape and paths
  I found that day transported me to an old world, centuries behind. My creativity
  and imagination were impreding spreading, and that feeling I have only felt once
  before, beneath a holm oak at the summit of a mountain close my home.


  So this travel story is a little bit about that, mixing emotions and feelings I
  will try to explain the best moment I have ever lived, running awy from the past
  and seeking my path in this world like an adventurous going up and down over the
  hills and finding out the way to a stuning bay close Portree.'
