Text: "In summer 2008 I released an indie music album. I was very excited about this,\
  \ and not too excited about my ordinary life at that moment. So I sent a few mails,\
  \ did some phone calls, quited my job, and began the adventure with some money in\
  \ cash, my guitar, and a small bag full of dreams. One of my friends decided to\
  \ come along. We rode the train from San Diego to Portland. Then stayed in Portland\
  \ for a month. Thirty days full of great experiences and new friends. A great opportunity\
  \ to share my culture, as I cooked some traditional Mexican food and played my songs\
  \ in several open mics, art galleries and markets. My friend had to go back because\
  \ her dad was very sick, so I continued my journey from Portland to Seattle, again,\
  \ riding the train to get there. I only stayed there for a week, but I got to visit\
  \ many places in just a few days, something interesting happened, this whole week\
  \ was cloudy and rainy. Then I checked to see If I could ride the train from Seattle\
  \ all the way to Montreal, but I then found a great deal to fly from there to my\
  \ next destination. \nI got on the airplane with great expectations, my trip had\
  \ been so awesome already, but I was ready for more. I spent the next three months\
  \ in Montreal, taking my music everywere, getting to know the language and culture,\
  \ trying new food, making new friends from all over the world, getting stuck in\
  \ the snow and spending time with myself, and writing new songs, getting inspired\
  \ with the beautiful landscapes and arquitecture.\nThe year was almost over and\
  \ I had one of my bucket list wishes on hold, hoping it would come true. This wish\
  \ was to spend Christmas and New Year\u2019s Eve in New York City. It seemed to\
  \ me like it was a miracle, because this actually came true. I said goodbye to my\
  \ good friends in Montreal, and rode the train down to New York. \nI spent the Holidays\
  \ there with my friend who came all the way from Mexico, and had the opportunity\
  \ to play my guitar, sing my songs and finally make my dream come true of saying\
  \ the countdown out loud, to begin 2009 in Time Square, dancing, feeling my toes\
  \ frozen and hugging people I never met before. \nThis adventure ended flying back\
  \ home after six months of living my dream every single day. \nI think this is one\
  \ of the best decisions I've ever made in my whole life, and I would do it again\
  \ without a doubt.\nEvery time I think about this trip, it makes me happy, it gives\
  \ me hope and faith. It makes me feel ready for the next life changing adventure."
