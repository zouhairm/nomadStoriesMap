Text: "Traveling for me is a special need and whenever I can, I travel on my Vespa.\
  \ As a small scooter there's no rush and no time schedules to deal with. No travel\
  \ plans to arrive anywhere. Just see small things, smell some fresh air and taste\
  \ different cultures. As I always travel by secondary roads, there's much more chances\
  \ to connect different people around and to make new friends.\nSome years ago, a\
  \ couple of friends asked me if I could go to airport and pick up an Italian guy.\
  \ Luca was coming from Brasil and he has been traveling all around the world on\
  \ a very old and rusty scooter, a 1965 Vespa. He brought his scooter all disassembled\
  \ with him as he didn't want to pay a lot of money for the transport. It was really\
  \ funny to see him crossing the arrival airport line with the chassis on his arm,\
  \ and 4 bags with spare parts around him! \n\nAs he was searching for a place to\
  \ put the scooter together and running again to return home, I suggested a friend's\
  \ garage to do the work. During two intense days and one night, we assembly together\
  \ his Vespa between some beers and lots of laughing. Each part of scratch metal\
  \ had its own little stories as he told me about his world travel. He said me he\
  \ was a Ferrari test driver in Maranello and he quits his dream job (well, in fact\
  \ too many young people dream jobs...) to make this unique journey. I asked why\
  \ he did it and he replies without any fear: \"I needed to know different people\
  \ and cultures apart the ones from my little city, specially after a great friend\
  \ of mine passes away from cancer a couple of years ago. I really needed to go out\
  \ and find some interior peace. I could go on a big Trail motorcycle, but it wouldn't\
  \ be the same for sure.  People were very kind to me everywhere I went and even\
  \ on countries like Pakistan, Russian, El Salvador etc I always was received with\
  \ a smiles and hugs, from the most little child to the very grown man. I like to\
  \ think its because of my Vespa,\" he said laughing. \nEven he told me he was searching\
  \ for a place to sleep in Lisbon, on the airport arrival, I insisted with him to\
  \ stay with my family. He are all close friends now. Since then, I started to see\
  \ the world with a different perspective. No one knows how long we will be around.\
  \ So it's time to get the road by myself and find others \"Luca's\""
