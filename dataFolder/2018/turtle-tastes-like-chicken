Text: "For the better part of a decade I have been living abroad. Not playing football\
  \ as I would have imagined in the earlier years of my life. Instead, I chose to\
  \ immerse myself in a world where there would be nothing but sun, palm trees and\u2026\
  \ Tourists. Mostly tourists. \nAfter six long years at University, with not much\
  \ more to show for it than several running tabs in the local pubs and a disgruntled\
  \ ex-girlfriend, who was having trouble coming to terms with the ex of it all, I\
  \ felt I should probably start doing something. My body was sending me pretty obvious\
  \ signals \u2013mostly in the form of kneecaps bending sideways- that this football\
  \ career I was working on, in between bar sessions, was probably never going to\
  \ happen. Nothing like a disfiguration of one of your limbs to make you see things\
  \ from a different perspective.\nEnticed by the idea of sun and palm trees, I ended\
  \ up working for a Swiss tour operator. When the human resources guy mentioned there\
  \ were some exotic destinations available for those that spoke Dutch, French and\
  \ German, I suddenly found myself fluent in a language I had never been taught.\
  \ Aha-Erlebnis! Faking my way through dealing with Germans by speaking Dutch with\
  \ a German accent did bring me to some remarkable places though. I got to live and\
  \ work all over Italy, Menorca and even Bali.\nIn those tourist riddled years I\
  \ did however manage to pick up a couple of things. Some languages and more importantly,\
  \ the love of my life. I went to Spain to find a nicely bronzed Mediterranean girl\
  \ and I ended up with a half English, half Irish girl who not only brightens my\
  \ every day, but also every dark room she walks into with the pale complexity of\
  \ her skin. Alas. I did however, casually ask her to join me on the Australian adventure\
  \ I was dreaming of. She will now tell everyone I practically begged her, but our\
  \ versions differ greatly. \nOur search for the true and wild Australia brought\
  \ us to the Northern Territory. We were doing some gardening for pocket money on\
  \ a little campsite deep in the hot Outback. I was doing some mowing around the\
  \ creek where a group of four big, strong, traditional Aboriginal women had been\
  \ fishing for turtles in the creek. They invited me over to share their meal. You\
  \ don\u2019t often get turtle on the menu and to have it freshly caught by a group\
  \ of Aboriginal women, who have a very private and segregated culture was -as Aboriginal\
  \ culture dictates- a dreamlike experience. \nWho could have thought, turtle tastes\
  \ like chicken!"
