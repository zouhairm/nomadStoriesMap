Text: "\u201CI will love her forever\u201D: A romantic sentence pronounced by a man\
  \ in love with his future wife? What if his mother chose his wife and he met her\
  \ only once before the wedding?\n\nTwo years ago I was invited from a colleague\
  \ to his wedding in New Delhi. My mind started to think about bright colors and\
  \ spicy flavors, but I didn't expect the people and their way of life could  change\
  \ my mind.\nLike others, I arrived there with some prejudices. A combined wedding?\
  \ Oh my God, luckily the Middle Ages are over in Europe! Well, I was wrong. The\
  \ city with its huge commercial centers, high palaces, large streets and numerous\
  \ cars is more similar to a chaotic european city than to an exotic place. Noises,\
  \ motorbikes and poor people everywhere, but at the same time music and happy smiling\
  \ children. If I should choose a word to define India, I would use contradictory.\
  \ You can remain stuck in the traffic for one hour while you drive 15 km, but then\
  \ you arrive to places like the Humayun's tomb, where time seems to have stopped.\
  \ People stroll through the silent gardens, fresh water spurt from fountains and\
  \ the grey modern buildings leave place to wonderful ancient monuments, while you\
  \ are still in the city center.\n\nThe celebration lasted one week: we saw the bride's\
  \ arrival, got our hands painted with henna, helped the groom to bleach his skin\
  \ with curcuma and danced on the roof with his family, but we became an attraction.\
  \ Everybody wanted to have pictures with us, because at their eyes we were different.\
  \ Even the children (little amazing princesses and princes with colorful dresses)\
  \ were curious and found the courage to ask us about our traditions. For them it\
  \ was strange that we were not a married couple, but two little girls surprised\
  \ me, saying that living together before getting married is a smart idea. They had\
  \ less prejudices than me.\nNevertheless I (and maybe you too) was still wondering\
  \ whether my friend could love a person without knowing her. Before the wedding,\
  \ he told me \u201CI will. My mother chose her for me, nobody knows me better than\
  \ her\u201D. There was no resignation in his words, he was sure, and I can tell\
  \ you that even today they are an amazing, happy couple. Although I would not ask\
  \ my mother to find my future husband, I learned something important. Every culture\
  \ has features that are worth to be discovered without prejudices. There are things\
  \ we cannot realize with logic. Traveling can open our minds and help us understanding\
  \ each others."
