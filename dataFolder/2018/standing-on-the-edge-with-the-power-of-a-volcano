Text: "\u201CMount Agung eruption: Should I cancel my trip to Bali?\u201D \u2013 That\
  \ was the highlight I read on September 2017, a couple days after I returned back\
  \ again to Asia after a recent visit to Peru where I had my first time experience\
  \ with sacred plants. There I choose Bali as my location to start a blogger's career\
  \ before knowing about the volcano eruption. Was the time cancel the \u201CEat,\
  \ pray, love\u201D in real life with a South American accent version? \nThe fear\
  \ and chaos was completely worldly spread at the time of the first eruption, getting\
  \ a lot of buzz on social medias. The airport was closing, travelers and tourists\
  \ were panicking; villagers were being moved to shelters. Indonesian authorities\
  \ have evacuated anyone within six miles away of the volcano. The last record of\
  \ a major eruption was back in 1963, killing over a thousand of people at the time.\
  \ \u201CShould I stay or should a go?\u201D That song was hammering on my head!\
  \ So then I put myself on a very exhausting \u201Cmeditation marathon\u201D, attending\
  \ 2 different Vipassana retreats in a roll. Despite my best efforts to go Bali straight\
  \ away, I took the decision to stay more time in Thailand where I landed two days\
  \ before the eruption. While I was staying in Thailand I stayed part of my time\
  \ in Koh Phangan, then I visited Phuket. I also lived for a month at the hectic\
  \ Bangkok, improving my googlemaps skills, seing how the city works. After that\
  \ I went for few days to India to visit a spiritual Guru asking for protection.\
  \ Before Christmas I called someone living in Ubud, who told me that there was completely\
  \ safe; many people had left but most of people resisted. Without any further questions,\
  \ I had booked my flights to Bali. On my first week in Bali, I was invited by video\
  \ maker to visit the surroundings of Volcano Agung. We left the next day early in\
  \ the morning. Few kilometers from far, we could spot Agung. We spent time with\
  \ the villagers most of the day. The refugee camps were packed with people and their\
  \ animals mixed all together. We brought some food and provisions to them. Has been\
  \ two months that I\u2019ve been in here and I can say that everyday I wake up with\
  \ a big smile on my face! I have immense pleasure to be immerse on this beautiful\
  \ culture. Since I arrived I attended almost all local ceremonies, knowing each\
  \ member of the village I live by their names. Sometimes even we don\u2019t speak\
  \ in English, only with some gestures and smiles; do the work.  So far has been\
  \ magical to stay on the edge of the volcano. Namaste."
