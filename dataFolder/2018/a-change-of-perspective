Text: "The ocean was alive, breathing deeply against the golden shores of Seminyak.\
  \ The beach was quiet under a grey sky, resting between tourist seasons when it\
  \ would be trampled by thousands of bare feet seeking reprieve. I watched the surfers\
  \ tame the waves that gleamed in any stray ray of sunshine penetrating the clouds.\
  \ \n\nI had come here, among the beach-side bars and abandoned sun chairs, as the\
  \ first stop of three months of solo travel through Southeast Asia. Bali was tame\
  \ enough, touristy enough, to sooth my terror at starting this journey alone. I\
  \ was a young woman after all, and I\u2019d heard far too many stories of the dangers\
  \ of travelling alone, of the thieves and kidnappers that apparently stalked every\
  \ street of anywhere that wasn\u2019t \u201Cwest\u201D.\n\nLater in my trip I\u2019\
  d hike through jungles in Thailand, boat down a shallow river through remote Cambodian\
  \ countryside and hitchhike through part of Malaysia. But right now, I needed somewhere\
  \ safer while I struggled to my feet.\n\nI turned from the dappled water and headed\
  \ up the beach towards a small surf shop where I had booked a surfing lesson. I\
  \ was early, but I checked in anyways. There was then nothing to do but sit on the\
  \ sandy porch alongside the local surf instructors and wait.\n\nWe stared at each\
  \ other, me awkwardly, them with smiles and curiosity. I\u2019m not the best in\
  \ social situations generally, and this was no exception. Yet somehow, we were soon\
  \ talking. One man, skinny and weathered by sea and sun, was delighted to learn\
  \ I was from Vancouver, Canada. He\u2019d been there once and was eager to share\
  \ stories of his travels.\n\n\u201CVancouver is nice, but it is so dangerous!\u201D\
  \ he told me. \u201CThe streets at night are frightening. There are sick people,\
  \ just everywhere.\u201D He mimed injecting himself with a needle.\n\nWhat could\
  \ I say to that? It was impossible to argue, not when every word was true. Yet here\
  \ I was, in Southeast Asia, the region everyone had told me was so dangerous. It\
  \ was odd, this dawning realization that perhaps the more dangerous place was the\
  \ spot I had just come from.\n\n\u201CBali is so safe,\u201D my instructor continued.\
  \ \u201CYou can go anywhere at night. It is small. I have spent all my life here,\
  \ but for Vancouver. I like it.\u201D He smiled, the kind of smile I would get so\
  \ used to throughout my travels, the one of infinite light and joy that almost all\
  \ the locals of this poverty stricken area seemed so well-practiced in.\n\nI looked\
  \ around at the quiet beach, the rolling grey waves. \u201CI like it too.\u201D"
