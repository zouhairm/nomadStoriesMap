Text: "Anticipatedly,we drove in our peaugeot 407 car:fascinated by the daunty and\
  \ prissy looks of the capital city of Abuja, attracted by the cynosures of the distant\
  \ Magicland :A major recreational park beside the Abuja City gate always a beehive\
  \ of activities as people go there to relax and have fun especially during vacation\
  \ .\nMy mum gently withdrew her left-hand from the drive to check the time:We  made\
  \ a mad dash for the park.\nNeedless to say, we are behind schedule:we alighted\
  \ to the elusine covered area with a vegetatively cultivated valley.\nwe were approached\
  \ by a mellow mannered may-guard who ushered us to the ticket-booking store:Sorry,\
  \ we have reservations left for only two persons ,the receptionist said with a negligent\
  \ look facing down and flipping through her records.Four pairs of eye clung against\
  \ each other:we animously turned back obviously crestfallen.\nThen, a sonorous voice\
  \ rushed to us: Good evening Madam.You couldn\u2019t get a ticket,right?With a slight\
  \ obnoxious look,Mum said Yes.I have 5 tickets left unsold as last minute reservation.Our\
  \ eyes bulged out and we gladsomely gave him a  smile as he quickly took us in:\n\
  I hopped over the turnstile stand.\nI and my two siblings  left mum to her fate:From\
  \ the Arcade and game center played with coin to the carousels, the roller coasters\
  \ I never tried as I tried only the Pirate Ship.My siblings tried several gaiety\
  \ like Mini-Wheel,Cow-Boy,Jungle Truck,Superspin while the  reserved-me watched\
  \ them like a spectator\nSuddenly,there was a shove on my back and as I turned,It\
  \ was a resilient  and beautiful young girl: I\u2019m very sorry,she said (She was\
  \ displaced of her stand).I nodded in response with a gloomy-face.My name is Emilia.What\
  \ about yours.(pause) I\u2019m Deji.\nThat occurrence changed my day from being\
  \ ordinary.She pushed me around,teasing me as if she had known me for years.Tension\
  \ dispersed off me.We talked about different topics from Politics,Sports,Education\
  \ and beyond.I became engrossed her as she talked in prehensile taking photographs\
  \ at every opportunity.I loved all aspect  of our interaction until my watch ticked,it's\
  \ time to go.It might have been short but it\u2019s a memory I would live to cherish\
  \ and ever regretting not exchanging contacts with hope that we would somewhere\
  \ and somehow.\nAll my life,I  had my guard up around strangers\nI was immersed\
  \ with self-thought of another similar exploitation with such a girl.\nWe drove\
  \ home ecstatic but tired that we all passed-out immediately we got home."
