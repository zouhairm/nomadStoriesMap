Text: 'On a recent visit to the alpine mountains surrounded by high altitude lakes,I
  explored the Elephant Lake in East Sikkim above the sunrise point,at the top of
  a serpentine road in the Eastern Himalayan territory.The blue lagoon symbolizes
  an epic place of meditation and peace and travelers can stay in single rooms in
  retreats and home stays facing the mountains.


  Solitude being my strength,I had never engrossed myself in silence beyond my occasional
  meditation hours.I went to explore the blue lagoon to think,retrospect and enjoy
  the blissful adventures surrounding the zone.The sounds came from the streaming
  rivera surrounding the retreat and we could auscultate the sounds of animals and
  birds several times a day.


  As my tenure of stay came to an end after spending one night,I enjoyed the scenic
  view of the mountains and the landscape surrounding the lake and environment.This
  photo,taken in the early morning when I arrived in this hamlet reminds me of enticing
  landscape where I can forget anything and set aside a few minutes to enjoy the heavenly
  silence.


  The rhetoric silence of this lake could be thought of as a romantic destination
  for directors willing to launch their next generation of films with co- actors and
  film producers.Although smaller in length,the high increased and unknown depth of
  this lake can be treated as an important measure to explore its actual width and
  intensity to delve further on its features.'
