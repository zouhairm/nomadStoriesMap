Text: "The rhythmic up and down swaying of the truck seat was rocking me to sleep\
  \ as I struggled to stay awake. My eyelids felt heavy.\nThe driver had stopped smoking\
  \ and all that remained was the smell of the old coffee I was offered hours ago\
  \ while a pop radio station played in the distance. He dialed it down as he glanced\
  \ over me, slowly sinking next to him. The twilight hadn\u2019t ended yet, and the\
  \ pinks and the oranges fused together  in a never-ending fight behind the mountains\
  \ that grew taller by the mile, as we got as far North as we could.\n\n\u2018Nobody\
  \ is going to stop\u2019 and \u2018the Swedish are too introverted to pick up strangers\
  \ on the road\u2019 were uttered by friends and strangers alike every time I explained\
  \ my plan. Although I pushed them out of my mind, a different memory lurked in,\
  \ and I saw myself a couple of years ago walking into a small town bar in Dalarna\
  \ county late one afternoon. There were five people total inside, plus the bartender.\
  \ The five of them were by themselves, fixated on their drinks or a mote of dust\
  \ on their tables and sitting in a way their eyes wouldn\u2019t intersect with one\
  \ another if they were to lift their heads up.\n\nTen hours of waiting under the\
  \ hot sun, next to a battered bus station deep inside the Swedish Taiga forests,\
  \ is what took for me to connect those two experiences and consider giving up. So\
  \ when a trailer came brushing over fresh pine needles and swinging birch trees\
  \ to the sides, I was still standing in the same spot, thumb up, holding my poorly\
  \ scribbled cardboard sign as I followed the truck slowing down 50 feet away. I\
  \ counted five, the seconds it took me to react. Grabbing my backpack in a whim,\
  \ I ran towards the front cabin as the passenger\u2019s door opened and the head\
  \ of a toothless Latvian man appeared through it, smiling.\nHe hand gestured a welcoming\
  \ sign and I pushed my backpack upwards towards the front seat. That lucky ride\
  \ kickstarted a 36h journey to the Polar Circle, as I changed transports, landscapes,\
  \ and people."
