Text: "\u201COh you would again have to take off your shoes\u201D, he spoke looking\
  \ at my feet. We had visited a small Nepalese village and were about to cross a\
  \ water channel in the forest. Before I could bend and take my shoes off, I was\
  \ already on his shoulders. We crossed the drain.\nI had headed as an Assistant\
  \ in the Project Elephant by the Government of India in the area of North Bengal.\
  \ For me the project was another milestone to be achieved, a factor to be highlighted\
  \ in my professional genre. \nThe vehicle dropped me onto my location. A 120 feet\
  \ watch tower that looked onto a stretch of grassland, the dry Torsa and the distant\
  \ mountains of Nepal was my residence for the next three days. It was the onset\
  \ of summer, drizzling and I was at Gorumara. The fire for dinner was lit up already.\
  \ A medium built man, dressed in khaki walked in. Flashing the torch light he introduced\
  \ himself to be Lakhinder, the Mahout.  \nPost the chores I chose to retire to the\
  \ top of the tower. Lakhinder accompanied me. The elephants were restless downstairs.\
  \ Lakhinder flashed his torchlight at them throwing out words in the local language.\
  \ In the next moment they fell silent, sleeping. Lakhinder told me, \u201CThey are\
  \ afraid because of the unfamiliar area\u201D. I noticed similar things over the\
  \ next three days as he directed Srimanta, the15 year old tusker. Its unnecessary\
  \ halts during work at the sight of lush green grass would again turn to movement\
  \ at his rebuke of, \u2018Maail...maail\u2026\u2019 He lamented often on the summers\
  \ drying up the grasslands and that the ration available wasn\u2019t sufficient.\
  \ I felt that he spoke of his own child. \nAll through the work stretch I remained\
  \ a witness to the stories of his family line having served as Mahouts; of the uncountable\
  \ nights he had slept on the back of the then young tusker; the manner he pacified\
  \ them to take up training far away from him; he scolding them: all evident by the\
  \ fact that they responded only to the call of his voice.\nThe vehicle had come\
  \ over again. The three day tour was over. The jeep shook at the ignition as I left\
  \ Lakhinder\u2019s home. \u201CThe lunch was delicious\u201D, I told him. \u201C\
  If you\u2019re ever here, count this to be your home\u201D, he replied. The jeep\
  \ drove through the forest. \nI had come here to mark it as an experience I can\
  \ count on. I was taking back an experience that I would live with. Those forests\
  \ which many claim as worksite earn them livelihood. Many Lakhinders survive within,\
  \ I had just met one."
