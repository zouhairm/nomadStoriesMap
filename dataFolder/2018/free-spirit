Text: "I love the internet. I've always have. One day I met this guy online who was\
  \ on the other side of the world. See, I am venezuelan. A freaky, hairy, funny one.\
  \ \n\nWe talked for about four months (every single day!), and one November I went\
  \ on vacations to Buenos Aires, to spend time with my best friend who lives there.\
  \ I had extra money so one day I thought \"why not?\", and there you have me, in\
  \ the middle of Barcelona's airport trying to convece police men that I came to\
  \ see La Sagrada Familia in person. \n\nFernando, my friend, was expecting for me\
  \ out there and recieved me with open arms. We went to La Rioja, and the next 20\
  \ days we travel to a lot of different places. I was amazed by standing in the Cuevas\
  \ de Las Brujas (witch caves) in Zugarramurdi where, the legend says, the witch\
  \ meeting used to take place. I learned a lot about Inquisition, Basque simbology\
  \ and nature's healer power. I will never forget about the beautiful landscapes\
  \ I was able to capture with my camera. \n\nBack in La Rioja, we were in Santo Domingo\
  \ de La Calzada, wich is part of The French Way, the most popular path of the Road\
  \ of St. James. This village has a giant Cathedral -the construction of which began\
  \ in 1098- and a barroque tower that is 70 meters high. From the top of the tower,\
  \ the views are beautiful and breathtaking. \n\nSanto Domingo is known for the miracle\
  \ of the \"hanged innocent\", a pilgrim mistakenly accused of theft and hung. His\
  \ father went to Compostela, returned thirty-six days later and found him alive,\
  \ held up by St. James. \n\nCovered by magic and miracles, we spent autumn days\
  \ in Logro\xF1o, talking about life and places to go, eating really good food and\
  \ walking around the city. We went to the Cathedral and other important churches,\
  \ ate some tapas in famous Laurel Street -you need to try the mushrooms, by the\
  \ way- and visited W\xFCrth Museum, in Agoncillo, a place to celebrate the art of\
  \ our time. It was quite an experience. This place also delivers art education to\
  \ children and showcases art in a full range of media. \n\nWe also visited the big\
  \ cities, but La Rioja made a deep and beautiful \"scar\" on my heart. So much so\
  \ that I came back the following year and ran to the same open arms that I did it\
  \ before. Suddenly, the last thing I expected happend. We are going to celebrate\
  \ our first wedding anniversary on July. \n\nI would never thought that a random\
  \ decision and being a free spirit were going to throw me into my true love's arms.\
  \ I cannot be more thankful to that day."
