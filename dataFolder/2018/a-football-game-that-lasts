Text: "An intense day shined brightly overhead as I exited my hotel. Dust stirred\
  \ everywhere in Phnom Penh and it seemed that every other motorbike passing by held\
  \ either several laughing teens or at least four generations hanging on for dear\
  \ life! I was leaving the hotel that day to discover my connection to Cambodia through\
  \ some perfect picture to post of my adventures. Cambodia had only recently felt\
  \ the relaxed grip of the Khmer Rouge and the streets were just beginning to be\
  \ filled with the rave of cell phones and western movies. In my walk I viewed many\
  \ busy mechanic shops, street caf\xE9s filled with conversation, and other small\
  \ businesses bustling with the energies of the newly discovered entrepreneur. As\
  \ the day progressed the heat caused me to seek refuge in the cool shade of a massive\
  \ overpass; hundreds of vehicles passed by on either side and above as I wiped sweat\
  \ from my bald head. The roar of the traffic was deafening as every exhaust loudly\
  \ reverberated on pass. Sitting on the concrete under the overpass, watching the\
  \ people as they rode by, I noticed a small girl sitting near me, near what appeared\
  \ to be her sleeping parents. The entire area was open and swept clean except for\
  \ their cluster of cardboard mats. The small girl just sat there watching me as\
  \ I rested on my own. I waved and smiled to her a few times but with no reply I\
  \ just began to move on, the little girl keeping watch, not moving a muscle, I suppose\
  \ just in case this white guy might suddenly get hungry. Entering back into the\
  \ sun, I continued my walk. Later that day while returning to the hotel, I passed\
  \ again under this highway. The little girl was playing football with her friends\
  \ and as expected they all froze when they noticed me. Some of the bigger kids shyly\
  \ began saying \u201CHello. How are you?\u201D, while the little kids simply stared.\
  \ I nervously smiled but kept my gaze lowered to quickly walk through. Yet before\
  \ I could cross the open area, the little girl ran to me and invited me to come\
  \ and play football with them. Her football was tattered and their goals were made\
  \ of collected cans from the street, but in that moment I experienced something\
  \ far greater than any post I could have ever shared. For that moment, I forgot\
  \ I was a foreigner in a distant land and instead I just felt\u2026happy, accepted;\
  \ which I suppose is a large reason why many of us travel. I left that day to find\
  \ my post to share from Cambodia, and in the end, it was they who shared with me."
