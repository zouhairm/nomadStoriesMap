Text: "Kenya\u2019s welcoming atmosphere was precisely what I needed for my short\
  \ stress relieving vacation. We reached the beautiful Maasai Mara Reserve in time\
  \ for a glorious African sunset and had dinner whilst being serenaded by the throaty\
  \ groans of the Maasai Warriors, the resort\u2019s silent protectors. \nOur safari\
  \ experience was unparalleled. A line of wildebeest, as far as the eye could see\
  \ into the horizon, migrated towards the watering holes in Tanzania. We observed\
  \ the majestic big cats, herds of elephants, hippos floating lazily in the water,\
  \ and the monkeys brazenly hanging outside our rooms. \nThe rooms consisted of luxurious\
  \ tents on wooden platforms. Upon entering there were two 4-poster beds, tables\
  \ adorned with beautiful lamps, a closet, and a bathroom. The electricity cut after\
  \ 12 am as customary to reserve power, and my friend, sister and I were engaging\
  \ in conversation when Mona (my sister), suddenly sat up in her single bed like\
  \ a threatened gazelle in the African wilderness. Her eyes wild with fright, she\
  \ stuttered that something big had tried to get through the tent wall. \nThen the\
  \ noises started\u2026something clawed the outside of our tent. It prowled around,\
  \ menacingly crunching leaves, roaring and growling. Convinced it was a wild animal,\
  \ I looked around for weapons. Amid this hysteria, the prowling creature clawed\
  \ the side of the tent again. Mona, who had been lurking near a window, came flying\
  \ at me with saucer like eyes and this alarming whimper emanating from her throat.\
  \ Taken aback by the sight of her face, I promptly contorted my face into the mask\
  \ from \u201CScream\u201D and let out an uncontrollable howl from the depths of\
  \ my being. \nWe squashed into the double bed, shivering. The stench of fear in\
  \ the air was strong. The nervous hushed laughter we were releasing would have better\
  \ reverberated around the walls of an insane asylum. \nThe madness continued well\
  \ into the morning. I worried that my stress induced stomach rumbling was acting\
  \ as a mating call for the scaly monster, but there was no quieting it now. \nBreakfast\
  \ was a timid affair for the three of us. We departed our tents only once we heard\
  \ the reassuring voices of the Maasai warriors. They checked the area surrounding\
  \ our tent, but no animal was found. \nThe last thing I expected, was my mischievous\
  \ cousin to pipe up with a grotesque smile on his face and gleefully inform us that\
  \ he had contrived the scariest range of noises he could imagine while circling\
  \ our tent on all fours."
