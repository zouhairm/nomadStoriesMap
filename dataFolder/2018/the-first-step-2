Text: "A decision. That not only pushed me to the edge but also made me who I am today.\
  \ My story is based on my first solo travel experience and my extremely unpleasant\
  \ friend called anxiety.\nThis is my story.\nVast fear, excessive worry and continuous\
  \ trembling, was where my journey really began. The night before my first ever solo\
  \ travelling experience I barely slept a wink. This was either due to anxious thoughts\
  \ or thoughts of excitement\u2026 Possibly both. I remember arriving at the airport\
  \ 5 hours before departure, frantically checking my passport was still in my left\
  \ hand. Still to this day I also remember the strong feeling of relief as I walked\
  \ onto the plane\u2026 a feeling in which I had never really felt before.  \n\n\
  I arrived in Australia. The country I had been dreaming, saving and without a doubt\
  \ rambling on about for seven whole months. I had been waiting for this moment for\
  \ so long but all I felt was pure emptiness. I forced myself over to the bar and\
  \ I was tapped on the shoulder. An Irishman who was clearly intoxicated at the time\
  \ asked me what I was doing alone. He questioned why I looked so gloomy. I laughed\
  \ and shook my head at myself with slight nervousness. \u201CCome drink with us\
  \ all, don\u2019t be scared, we\u2019ve all be through it, you\u2019ll be alright\u201D\
  \ were his exact words. This person didn\u2019t even know me. This person went out\
  \ of his way (even if he was intoxicated) to support and reassure a complete stranger.\
  \ It worked. I did go drink with them and it was honestly one of the best decisions\
  \ I\u2019ve made. Not only in this situation but also in many more whilst i've been\
  \ travelling, I\u2019ve realised the world isn\u2019t all that bad.\n\nAt that moment\
  \ in my life I saw myself as ungrateful for an opportunity of a lifetime. I see\
  \ my story in a completely different way now. I see a strong 20 year old girl who\
  \ is brave enough to push herself to the edge and face her fears. I\u2019m aware\
  \ that there\u2019s always going to be hurdles along the way. Travel however has\
  \ helped me deal with not only my anxiety but enlightened me on life as a whole.\
  \ I\u2019ve overcome and gone beyond my comfort zone whilst exceeding my own expectations.\
  \ I\u2019ve finally realised staying in my own comfort zone is actually quite tedious.\
  \ I am now forever challenging myself, doing what I want to do and doing it with\
  \ complete passion and love. Life is all about learning and improving yourself and\
  \ that\u2019s exactly what I am going to achieve."
