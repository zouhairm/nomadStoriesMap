Text: "The first thing that comes in mind when asked to narrate a local connection\
  \ made, would evolve around a person that made life easier and gave the ticket to\
  \ some \u201Clocals\u2019 only\u201D reserved experiences and even end in that person\
  \ being added to the list of the Christmas-card recipients. But what if that local\
  \ connection was not a human but rather a feeling, an experience that would make\
  \ the connection with that place eternal? This would actually be my case. I travelled\
  \ to Tulum almost two winters ago to satisfy my blatant escapism hoping that this\
  \ could help my mind wander far away for my daily hectic routine of an unfulfilling\
  \ job and a roller coaster relationship. I remembered the days going by effortlessly,\
  \ waking up to meditate during sunrise, attending yoga classes, savoring local dishes,\
  \ swimming in the cenotes and discovering the Mayan ruins; basically doing whatever\
  \ I had to do to keep me busy and keep my mind away in a \u201Cplacebo\u201D state.\
  \ One day, while sipping my coconut, I heard two ladies chatting about \u201Ctemazcal\u201D\
  . I already tried \u201Cmezcal\u201D the tequila-like spirit but surely they were\
  \ not discussing about margaritas\u2026Thanks to a quick google search I found out\
  \ that \u2013excuse the Wikipedia-plagiarism-: \u201Cit is a type of sweat lodge\
  \ which originated with pre-Hispanic Indigenous peoples in Mesoamerica. It is currently\
  \ being recovered by all sectors of society in Mexico and Central America and is\
  \ used as a cleansing of mind, body and spirit\u201D. I was sold! The next day,\
  \ greeted by a shaman, a local healer that is, I was shown the way to the inside\
  \ of the temazcal\u2026a tiny entrance to what seemed \u2013an later felt- like\
  \ an oven for a tall girl like me was uncomfortable and more so when a blanket was\
  \ used to cover the entrance and the whole place turned pitch black. I was totally\
  \ out of my comfort-zone; sure I had myriads of hammam baths and ignorantly thought\
  \ this was similar; but this was not about enduring the heat; it was about enduring\
  \ yourself, your thoughts, and your feelings.  At first I felt trapped in a low-ceiling\
  \ structure, lightless, even shadow-less, boiling hot atmosphere that I could not\
  \ deal even with my best ujayi breath. But in between drum beats, chanting in words\
  \ I could not pronounce, the smell of sage and the vapor from the hot stones, I\
  \ sweat, I smiled, I cried\u2026not necessarily in that order; but most of all I\
  \ surrendered to the release of my suppressed feelings to the acceptance that escapism\
  \ is not a cure in itself and one needs confrontation."
