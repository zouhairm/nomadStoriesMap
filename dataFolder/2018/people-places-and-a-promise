Text: "Ten years ago I was 16, sitting on a plane thinking about the relationships\
  \ I built, the food I tried and the places I saw over the course of three weeks.\
  \ My eyes filled with tears as we descended. I didn\u2019t know whether to cry about\
  \ leaving the host family I lived with or knowing a hug from my dad was a few steps\
  \ away. \n\nIt was nearly midnight as I walked to baggage claim.\n\n\u201CKarbar!\u201D\
  \ \n\nI dropped my carry-on and ran to receive the hug I\u2019d been waiting for\
  \ since leaving M\xE9rida, Mexico. \n\n\u201CHey kid, you hungry?\u201D I smiled\
  \ at the familiarity of late night meals as he grabbed my suitcase. \n\nSitting\
  \ at IHOP I told a story at high-speed after he said, \"Tell me everything.\"\n\n\
  \u201CWhen we left, I was super excited. As we got closer to meeting our families\
  \ I got nervous. I don\u2019t speak as much Spanish as everyone else. I\u2019m the\
  \ youngest one. I had to take extra classes to come, you know?\u201D \n\nHe nodded,\
  \ encouraging me to continue.\n\n\u201CI lived with a single mom and a girl my age,\
  \ Majo was her nickname. They took me everywhere: school, a cenote, the market,\
  \ the Mayan World Museum of M\xE9rida.\n\nI saw Chich\xE9n Itza again! Did you know\
  \ during the equinox a 120-foot-long snake shadow moves down the pyramid? We snorkeled\
  \ with SO many sea turtles. I almost kissed one on accident. Did you know it's illegal\
  \ to touch a sea turtle?\u201D\n\nHe gave an enthusiastic \"no.\" \n\n\u201CI loved\
  \ my host mom. She was the best cook but she didn\u2019t speak ANY English. The\
  \ first week was hard, my Spanish was awful. But by the end of the trip we were\
  \ talking all day. \n\nI miss them already. I didn\u2019t know if I should cry because\
  \ I was excited to see you or I was sad to leave. I wish I could have stayed longer;\
  \ three weeks wasn't enough.\u201D \n\nHe paused, \u201CI think both.\u201D\n\n\
  My eyes filled again as my dad said the last thing I expected him to say. \n\n\u201C\
  I\u2019m proud of you. You appreciate diversity. You want to learn about the world\
  \ and the people in it. You're fearless and I never want you lose your sense of\
  \ adventure. You need to see the world, promise?\u201D \n\n\u201CI promise.\u201D\
  \ \n\nThe beauty of each trip I've been since hasn't been the tourist hot spots,\
  \ but rather, the people I've met. Each trip has introduced friendships extending\
  \ across oceans and borders. My goal, if chosen, is to continue to appreciate the\
  \ diversity humanity has to offer with the same sense of wonder and adventure that\
  \ fueled the promise I made a decade ago."
