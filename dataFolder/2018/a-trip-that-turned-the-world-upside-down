Text: "I remember my first time sitting on a suitcase trying to zip my whole life\
  \ inside of it. I was 17 y.o. about to begin my first journey abroad as an exchange\
  \ student. How thrilling! Especially when the destination is California and you\
  \ have a chance to fully emerge yourself in an American culture! On the plane I\
  \ had only one question racing through my head: How will it feel to make a local\
  \ connection with this country? \nThe first thing I remember from the USA is a hug\
  \ my host mother gave me. It was a hug of the stranger that I gave myself a word\
  \ I would never forget. So, I kept it. I do remember that hug. And when someone\
  \ asks me how does it feel to make a local connection with a completely different\
  \ country and people, I already have an answer in store. A local connection is not\
  \ just the first local conversation you have with a foreigner, nor it is the question\
  \ of the first couple of days you become familiar with the surroundings. It is an\
  \ every single day, if not a moment, you spend abroad. It is in every new person\
  \ you meet, it is in every picture you take, in every new place you visit. I spent\
  \ in the USA a little bit less than 365 days, but there was not a day I did not\
  \ make a local connection with people, places, culture. It is not an easy undertaking.\
  \ It is willingness to leave all of the stereotypes behind, it is about being open\
  \ and understanding our differences. It is about walking in somebody\u2019s shoes.\
  \ My making the local connection started with a single smile and in that tiny plane\
  \ taking me home I could not stop my tears from falling down. Leaving your new friends\
  \ and family not knowing whether you will have a chance to meet them in your life\
  \ ever again is a price one should be ready to pay for making a local connection.\
  \ Even if I will be able come back again it will never be the same again.\nSo, how\
  \ will I describe California? California is like a diamond \u2013 so multisided,you\
  \ never how it will sparkle for you the next time rays of sunshine will fall on\
  \ it. It can sparkle with the orange colors of the desert and if you turn it around\
  \ - with the greenery of the Sequoia forest, if there is no sun you will find the\
  \ fogs of San Francisco in it, or at the other side you can see the reflections\
  \ of the waves of the Pacific ocean, turn around again and it will blind you with\
  \ camera flashes in Hollywood\u2026. I remember making my local connection to each\
  \ of these places. I keep everything in photographs. California is a place where\
  \ I left a part of my heart."
