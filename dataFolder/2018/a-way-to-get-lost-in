Text: "I woke up at 6 am on the morning of the trek. I was in Paro valley, ready to\
  \ hike up to the mystical Paro Taktsang, tiger\u2019s nest, alone. It was a day\
  \ before my 23rd birthday. The valley had woken up a while ago, with the sounds\
  \ of the birds, the river flowing through the woods and smoke of last night\u2019\
  s campfires in the air; I was greeted by the two mountain dogs on my way downhill\
  \ from the hotel to the town square. We broke bread like old friends meeting each\
  \ other after a day apart. Reluctantly, I left them to follow the path to the most\
  \ awaited part of my trip... \u201CTiger\u2019s nest,\u201D is in an odd name for\
  \ a monastery; what\u2019s more fascinating is the legend of it. It is the story\
  \ of their great Buddhist guru, Guru Rinpoche, who is said to have flown in, on\
  \ the back of a tigress; the temple was consecrated to tame the Tiger demon. \n\
  Coming all the way to Bhutan had silenced some demons of my own. Waking up with\
  \ anxiety on most days for the past few months was no walk in the park. Since the\
  \ day I\u2019d crossed the border, from cab drivers to, strangers in the city of\
  \ Thimpu, looked at me incredulously when I mentioned I was travelling solo.\n\n\
  The walk to the town was fogging my breath as the first winter chill sets in on\
  \ a November morning. The Stark landscape of yesterday afternoon, bare rice crop\
  \ fields, due to being harvested before winter, changed into the blooming view of\
  \ the bridges over river beds, and the Thangka art painted arduously over window\
  \ sills of houses, kept me occupied on the twenty minute taxi ride to the base of\
  \ Tiger\u2019s nest.\n\n \u201CFor here in this kingdom, rules an unparalleled benevolent\
  \ King,\u201D Read the sign at beginning of the trail. My heart thumped with trepidation,\
  \ as I paid the guy who sold me a hiking stick. I walked up with strong strides\
  \ towards the steep climb. If there\u2019s a good way to die it must be hiking up\
  \ to the top of this hill, I muttered out loud. \n\nAs the cloud cover veiled the\
  \ trail, the higher I went, the young, and older Bhutanese guides with the other\
  \ groups motivated me to finish the four hour long trek. It\u2019s easier to find\
  \ faith in this country, where people are nice to each other and growth is measured\
  \ in the happiness of its population.\nI met an elderly couple from Mumbai on the\
  \ trail, \u201CBrave girl,\u201D The ex-colonel said when he heard I was travelling\
  \ solo from India. I smiled, as I flashed back to the bright afternoon in a parking\
  \ lot, two months ago, where I had my first panic attack. Some mountains we do conquer\
  \ indeed."
