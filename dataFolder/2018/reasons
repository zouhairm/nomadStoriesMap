Text: "I don't really know why I'm doing this.  I am not very good at English and\
  \ I only write when I need to exprese myself and organize my mind. In fact, I never\
  \ show my work, but I think that now this is a good oportunity. I have almost twenty\
  \ years all, and I only made some travels out of my country, Spain, but this year\
  \ I realized that my mean to be is being journalist and meet all the cultures I\
  \ can. We are in this world to do something, to learn and to open our minds, and\
  \ the best way to archived this goals is travelling and writing.  I am bisexual,\
  \ and this make me see how the world and society act when they have fear to thing\
  \ that they don't know. It make me learn about myself and the human nature. Maybe,\
  \ the reason that racism, homophobia and hate exist is that people don't really\
  \ want to know new realitys, don't open their minds and see that our souls are all\
  \ the same. If all people make a journey to a far place, with a different culture,\
  \ religion, costumes, and discover that we all have more things to be brothers that\
  \ enemies, maybe, all horrible things like holocaust will never exist again.  And\
  \ that's why I want to cross the ocean, write about all I see and came to Spain\
  \ again to show my people how others exprese themselfs, how they love, what are\
  \ their fears and weaknesses and make them see that are the same, and push others\
  \ to do the same journey, amo me, to learn more about themselves and others. \n\
  I want to apologize me because I know that my words may be basics, and my writing\
  \ in a foreing language not very good, but I believe that all of use have a good\
  \ reason to exprese ourselves and raise our dreams so I wrote my thoughts the best\
  \ I could."
