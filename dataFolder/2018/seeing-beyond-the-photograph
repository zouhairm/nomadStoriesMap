Text: "Coming over a rise, we paused. Situated under a mushroom-shaped sandstone formation\
  \ sat four squat, unremarkable ruins\u2014very different from what the pictures\
  \ had made them out to be. A moment later, however, the late morning sun appeared\
  \ from behind a cloud and the scene transformed. Flames burst from the roofs of\
  \ the ruins and licked their way up the wall.\nMy companion and I stood captivated.\
  \ This optic illusion is what had drawn us across the desert. Years ago, I had seen\
  \ a photograph of this spot and felt an intense desire to experience it for myself.\
  \ It wasn\u2019t until Bears Ears became one of the most contested sites in the\
  \ United States National Park System, that I remembered that desire, let alone knew\
  \ where it was located.\nFor a few minutes, we had the site to ourselves. I lay\
  \ on the sandstone and watched the shifting light play with the unique coloring\
  \ and erosion of the wall. We took pictures and poked our heads into the ruins that\
  \ smelled of cool, dry dust. Eventually, a group of travellers appeared, having\
  \ made the mile-long walk from the trailhead. We took this as our cue to continue\
  \ up the canyon in search of other cultural sites.\nI had expected the trail to\
  \ be barren, but the dry riverbed showed signs of a recent flood, which left the\
  \ canyon floor teeming with red and yellow wildflowers. As we marveled at the beauty,\
  \ we came across another large group of hikers.\n\u201CDo you know how to find House\
  \ on Fire?\u201D they asked.\n\u201CYou missed it,\u201D I said. \u201CIt\u2019\
  s about a mile back, twenty yards off the trail, but there are more ruins ahead.\
  \ You could see those before stopping on your way back to the car.\u201D\n\u201C\
  What\u2019s the point of coming all this way if I don\u2019t get my picture?\u201D\
  \ one woman joked.\nAn autumn breeze carried the spicy, woody aroma of junipers\
  \ as the group deliberated. \u201CI think we\u2019ll turn back,\u201D a man said.\n\
  This was the last thing I expected, especially as we stood talking in the midst\
  \ of a rare desert bloom. But fixed as they were upon their destination (and subsequent\
  \ social media likes), they failed to see the remarkable scene before them.\nWe\
  \ travelled farther up the canyon, never crossing paths with another traveller until\
  \ returning to the first site, which was bustling with people trying to capture\
  \ the moment.\nI\u2019m no better. I also took a picture and posted it on social\
  \ media. But while visiting House on Fire is an experience I cherish, it is actually\
  \ those quiet moments of solitude amid the wildflowers that stand out most. And\
  \ therein lies the crux."
