Text: "Standing at the mouth of the cave, I am within the face of the gorge that cleaves\
  \ the city of Matera from the surrounding countryside. Notwithstanding the transmission\
  \ tower and a smattering of cranes across it\u2019s skyline, I can imagine the Stone\
  \ City of Southern Italy remaining unchanged for centuries as seen from this vantage\
  \ point.\n\nEarlier that morning, I had been admiring the ceiling of a Materan church\
  \ when a man in his seventies appeared at my side. Following some tentative introductions\
  \ in Italian and English, my new friend Franco beckoned me to follow him through\
  \ a roped off transept where we were met with an immediate view of the gorge\u2019\
  s plunging side, pockmarked with innumerable caves. \n\nHaving grown increasingly\
  \ frustrated with our stilted communication, he again motioned for me to follow\
  \ him. This time down the center aisle and into the blazing sunlight where I find\
  \ him unlocking a car. Evidently if I can\u2019t be told, I\u2019ll be shown.\n\n\
  As we drive through the winding streets into the outskirts of the city we pass cows\
  \ tolling their bells in small herds and red poppies swaying in amongst oceans of\
  \ wheat. Arriving at a seemingly unremarkable and dusty outcrop, Franco wordlessly\
  \ vaults out of the car and scuttles down a hillside. When I eventually catch up\
  \ to him I find myself enveloped in the damp air of an enormous cave. \n\nPeople\
  \ have resided in the caves of Matera since the Paleolithic era - from humble dwellings\
  \ sheltering families and their animals to the present day where the growing tourism\
  \ boom has seen the caves re-branded as trendy boutique hotels. Towards the back\
  \ of the cave, Franco points out a shallow depression in the cave floor. I infer\
  \ that it was once used to grind wheat. Though at what point in the city\u2019s\
  \ 9,000 year history remains a mystery.\n\nYet again, a man forty years my senior\
  \ is leaving me to follow in his wake, the way made fragrant by the wild garlic\
  \ crushed underfoot, until we stand in front of a grotto covered in frescoes depicting\
  \ the Madonna and child, the crucifixion, saints. \n\nStanding there, I understand\
  \ his motivation to ferry a complete stranger around the countryside. His sense\
  \ of place and the weight of its history were tangible here, and he wanted to share\
  \ it.\n\nWhen we return to the city I notice what I hadn\u2019t that morning. Stalls\
  \ selling neon selfie sticks and tourists flooding the squares.The world is discovering\
  \ Matera, but the spirit of this place and its people is as permanent as the stone\
  \ it is built from."
