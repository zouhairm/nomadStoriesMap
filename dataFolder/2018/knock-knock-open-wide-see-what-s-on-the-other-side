Text: "\u201CTake that off now!\u201D The first words uttered to me as I opened the\
  \ door into Armenia. Having just crossed the Iranian border, formerly one of the\
  \ tensest points of the Cold War era, in the dead of night, on foot, I was somewhat\
  \ taken aback but also mildly amused by the border guard\u2019s theatrical finger\
  \ pointing at my hijab.\n\nGrowing up my knowledge of Armenia was admittedly limited.\
  \ If pushed to name three things it was known for I would have said: former Soviet\
  \ State, cognac and...the Kardashians. Bless my ignorance!\n\nWhat I would discover\
  \ about this \"Road less travelled\" underappreciated country tucked away in the\
  \ Caucasus was just how much I had been missing out on. And if I had been underestimating\
  \ this lesser visited locale what other off the beaten track destinations had I\
  \ been overlooking?!\n\nIn Goris, a town known for its old village cave city, the\
  \ Cappadocia of Armenia, I happened across my favourite restaurant in the world.\
  \ A lover good food, I would happily take dinner in this Soviet memorabilia packed\
  \ house over a Michelin star meal any day, if for no other reason than the experience\
  \ of eating countless Armenian dishes with names I\u2019ll never remember, attempting\
  \ to smoke disreputable filter less cigarettes and drink vodka with young local\
  \ soldiers laughing in hysterics and seeing my food being prepared in earth oven\
  \ pits and spit roasted on the road side. Intoxicating.\n\nHow many people can say\
  \ they\u2019ve been to the Republic of Artsakh formerly known as Nagorno-Karabakh,\
  \ an unrecognized breakaway republic slash frozen conflict zone, internationally\
  \ recognised as part of Azerbaijan? From the quirky capital of Stepanakert complete\
  \ with a \u201CGrandma and Grandpa\u201D monument prominent on its coat of arms,\
  \ to visiting the \u201CDMZ\u201D abandoned town of Agdam AKA \u201CThe Hiroshima\
  \ of the Caucuses\u201D, to touristing in the wacky village of Vank taking in the\
  \ strange Titanic and Seastone hotels built by a local eccentric billionaire rumoured\
  \ to be imprisoned by Putin!\n\nI could ramble on about the virtues of putting Armenia\
  \ on a bucket list \u2013 home to the longest cable car in the world, a monastery\
  \ carved out of a mountain, a stone henge twice as old as the English one, some\
  \ of the warmest and most likeable people you will ever meet, treacherous mountain\
  \ roads (worth the risk)... One of the best things about visiting a place you know\
  \ nothing of is that you have no expectations and as such, around every corner is\
  \ a new discovery, and Armenia is full of pleasant unexpected surprises."
