Text: "My whole trip to Jordan was a constant surprise and its story could have easily\
  \ fallen under the theme of \u2018last thing I expected\u2019. I wasn\u2019t certainly\
  \ planning to hit it off with or be asked for my Facebook by the Bedouins in Petra.\
  \ Or that one of the fellas would propose on a donkey. The point is: I could literally\
  \ go on and on about everything I felt during this trip, how otherworldly stunning\
  \ was to see the Treasury both in daylight and by the candlelight or poetically\
  \ describe the sunset view I had whilst sitting on a camel in Wadi Rum. However,\
  \ I will focus on the seemingly most trivial anecdote of the trip: the snorkelling\
  \ experience in the Red Sea. \n\nWith the few free hours I had on this organized\
  \ tour, I had imagined a relaxing sunkissed glass-bottom boat ride but that\u2019\
  s not quite what my tour guide had in mind though. Snorkelling? I had learnt how\
  \ to swim (or float?) only a couple of years earlier, and the last thing I was prepared\
  \ for was to go deep in the sea with some plastic stuff I had never worn before.\
  \ I declined politely, saying I was scared of swimming in the sea yet happy to enjoy\
  \ the whole boat ride. Somehow the whole group teamed up and convinced me this was\
  \ a not-to-be-missed experience, so we came to an agreement: snorkelling in exchange\
  \ of an instructor swimming next to me. And there I was, a 30-year old making a\
  \ fool of herself on a boat full of tourists. \n\nSo, I was ready. On my left, Israel;\
  \ on my right, Saudi Arabia. I did it. I jumped into my fear. At first, I was so\
  \ focused on the \u201Cswim and breathe\u201D sequence that I was barely paying\
  \ attention to the fish galore swimming with me. Suddenly, the instructor left my\
  \ hand and I tacitly panicked. Swim and breathe, swim and breathe. I was underwater,\
  \ I was awake. What a privilege, to be there, admiring the myriad colours around\
  \ me and the sweet coral moves in the background! OK. It\u2019s not like I climbed\
  \ a mountain or did some sort of other instagrammable #yolo crazy stuff. But who\
  \ needs a camera when you know you\u2019ll never forget something? Isn\u2019t it\
  \ all about that \u201COh my God, I can\u2019t believe I did it!\u201D moment? That\u2019\
  s the highlight you\u2019ll keep with you eventually and that\u2019s ultimately\
  \ what this story boils down to.  In that moment, back on the boat, wrapped in a\
  \ beach towel, that\u2019s when I thought: sometimes to overcome your fears, you\
  \ need to acknowledge them by holding the hand of someone you can trust. And that\u2019\
  s how you keep writing the exciting history of your life."
