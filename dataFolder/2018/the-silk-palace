Text: "I got off the tour bus with my head thrown back in the sky, looking up at a\
  \ tasteful, orangey blue, soft autumn morning of Beijing. Inhaling the heavy thick\
  \ air that somehow weighed me down. I squeezed my eyes tightly and opened them wide.\n\
  \"I\u2019m really here\" I breathed. \n\nI felt the scrunched paper of 500 Yuan\
  \ in my jean pockets. I stood still staring at my surroundings. whilst cars beeped\
  \ for me to get off the sidewalk. This was amusing. This was a new world were rules\
  \ were ruled out.\nI looked around for something like silk material over tiny huts,\
  \ people wearing cultural and native clothes. To my disappointed reality not everything\
  \ looked like a Sex and the City movie. \n\n\u201CPretty lady! Pretty lady! Nice\
  \ dress here for you!\u201D \nThe silk market was packed with so many people, it\
  \ felt impossible to get around.  In every shop window stood young girls folding\
  \ clothes, arranging shoes and calling out to people for new sales.  \n\nI wondered\
  \ around looking without seeing. I thought to myself why I felt pressured into buying\
  \ something, when I have everything I need. \nLost in thought, I was breath taken\
  \ by an unexpected antique stand covered with, soulful coloured, sun umbrellas.\n\
  \nThe old man was busy working away on a new umbrella, his hands gently holding\
  \ the paintbrush, carefully carving various annotations and designs.  \nRaising\
  \ his eyebrows and kindly smiling at me he brought out a small delicate cup and\
  \ poured hot water into it from a tea set. \nHe gestured me to come forward. I looked\
  \ down at the tea wondering what could he have poured in it.\n\n\u201CLongjing tea\u201D\
  \ he said, smiling at me. \nmoving closer I watched the colours of the umbrellas\
  \ dance around my skin. \n\u201CThis mean Dragon Well Tea, served once to the great\
  \ Kangxi Emperor\u2026 please, enjoy\u201D. \nI smiled back at him and took the\
  \ no handle cup with my palms.\nSwishing the content and smelling it, I took a sip\
  \ of what tasted simply of a sweet nutty yet buttery textured flavour. \nThe man\
  \ went back to creating his umbrella, adding white silk material on the inside.\
  \ \nI drank the remainder and gently placed the cup back on his work station. \n\
  \nHe smiled and bowed his head. I reached up and pulled down a floral purple umbrella\
  \ with golden silk on the inside. \nTaking out the 500 Yuan from my pockets, I tucked\
  \ it into the cup. Bringing my hands together I bowed my head. He bowed his head\
  \ in acceptance.\nI walk out of his silk shaded palace, lost in thought about the\
  \ kindness of strangers. In a way, we are all connected."
