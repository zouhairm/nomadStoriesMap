Text: "I traveled to Cura\xE7ao last May with my exes sister Shona. It was our second\
  \ day in Cura\xE7ao and we decided we wanted to go downtown. The staff at our resort\
  \ said to take the bus downtown. Once we arrived I was taken back by all the beautiful\
  \ colours of the buildings. Cura\xE7ao has a huge Dutch population. We took the\
  \ floating bridge from punda (city) across to otrabanda (the other side). Once we\
  \ were across I immediately felt like I was in the ghetto. We walked down a few\
  \ blocks and felt unsafe so we headed back towards the bridge. A large ship was\
  \ coming through so we decided to try the free ferry. We were the only people on\
  \ the ferry other than this one gentleman. He began taking pictures of mine and\
  \ Shona\u2019s faces. This set off a red flag in my head. So I started asking him\
  \ questions like where are you from? Are you a local or travelling? His English\
  \ was very good when he talked to the ferry driver but when I asked him these questions\
  \ he forgot his English. We finally reached punda and I grabbed Shona\u2019s arm\
  \ and said \u2018walk fast and don\u2019t look back.\u2019  Shona was clueless.\
  \ I told her I feel like I\u2019m on the movie \u2018taken\u2019 right now. Like\
  \ you don\u2019t just take pictures of random peoples faces. Especially two young\
  \ pretty girls. We entered a store to try and lose him. When we came out he was\
  \ standing right there. We bolted for the Cura\xE7ao sign because I wanted a picture\
  \ there. I made friends with this older couple that looked like they could be our\
  \ parents. The man disappeared so we continued on shopping. We came out of another\
  \ store and he was there again!! I grabbed Shona\u2019s arm and said \u2018we have\
  \ to get back to the resort now. We will come back to punda another day.\u2019 We\
  \ started walking towards the bus and he followed us. Luckily the bus was just about\
  \ to leave when we arrived at the station. We hopped on and returned to the resort.\
  \ We met a nice couple later that evening who informed us that Cura\xE7ao is known\
  \ for sex trafficking as it is so close to Venezuela. Shona finally believed me!!\
  \ We ended up going downtown 3 days later and didn\u2019t have a run in with out\
  \ friend."
