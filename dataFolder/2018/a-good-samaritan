Text: "Cancelled taxis, broken ATMs and last-minute bed-searching were all a thing\
  \ of the past. Troubleshooting Murphy\u2019s Law once again, I calmed down \u2013\
  \ everything will be fine.\nWell, maybe not quite right now. My phone blacks out.\
  \ My only ticket for the bus is on that phone. The only ticket, for the only bus,\
  \ for my only flight home...why? Searching my brain for options, the most plausible\
  \ one fell on the \u2018nearby\u2019 museum. No time to debate, I drag my bulky\
  \ suitcase up the never-ending stairs, trip through the revolving doors and sprint\
  \ to the reception to futilely mime a charger. No luck, exasperation. An involuntary\
  \ Russian cuss slips my tongue as I sigh. What do I do now?\n\u201C\u0423 \u043C\
  \u0435\u043D\u044F \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044C,\u201D\nI spin round searching for the\
  \ source of this homely, Russian talk. \u201CI have one.\u201D Such simple words\
  \ can bring such sudden tranquillity. Sitting less than a meter away, a young gentleman\
  \ was observing me, waiting for my response. My overwhelmed, speechless demeanour\
  \ encouraged him to proceed without my input,\n\u201CWhat phone? iPhone?\u201D\n\
  \ No response was needed as my hand was clumsily outstretched, desperately clutching\
  \ the device.\n\u201COh. I have an android one\u2026\u201D\nThe prospect of this\
  \ fateful meeting being the resolution to my worries began to languish. The return\
  \ of my enveloping distress slid into this leeway but was halted in its tracks,\n\
  \u201CMihas has one!\u201D\nBefore I could begin piecing all the information together,\
  \ he eagerly browsed the foyer, shook his head and darted outside.\nThe pace of\
  \ the situation\u2019s metamorphosis did not give me a chance to logically make\
  \ sense of it. Now, as I waited, my mind began to explain the medley of emotions\
  \ I was experiencing. But rather than focussing on the current, pressurising circumstances\
  \ it was in awe of the good Samaritan encountered. This man genuinely wanted to\
  \ help a complete stranger in a foreign country with the only real link being a\
  \ common language. That is incredible, heart-warming and enlivening!\nWith the departure\
  \ of the bus impending, I make my way towards it without receiving the charger.\
  \ It didn\u2019t matter as much anymore; was less important than the wonderful connection\
  \ that was made, reassuring that everything will definitely be fine.\nAs I advance,\
  \ the kind acquaintance runs up handing me a charger to keep, his smile in return\
  \ to my many thanks tells me that this confluence of our paths has made just as\
  \ positive an impact on him."
