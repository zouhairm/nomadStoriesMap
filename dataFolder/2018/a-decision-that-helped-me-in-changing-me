Text: "Well, to start with I would like to introduce myself as a person who has been\
  \ en tangled with the duties and mere responsibilities of my life. Like a lay man,\
  \ I have always been told to perform certain set of tasks repeatedly and this keeps\
  \ going on.\nFamily expected me to get settled and earn a lot to sustain likelihood.\
  \ Colleagues in work area have  been throttling me with the same verse of targets\
  \ that needs be achieved to maintain my position in the office. \n\nOne day sitting\
  \ alone in my bed I counseled myself telling me that this is not the only thing\
  \ i came in this world for. I need to do something I love and truly admire. I jotted\
  \ down the things I love like music, travelling, eating, talking to different people\
  \ and so on. So start with something I thought why not to go with travelling , something\
  \ that inspires my mind, body, heart and soul. Planning my time out my busy schedule\
  \ I planned a trip to Ranthambhore, a wildlife reserve where you spot exotic species\
  \ like tigers, 2 horned rhinos, spotted leopards and many more. \n\nThis was the\
  \ very first time I stepped out my comfort zone and made a decision to travel alone\
  \ and explore the treasures of nature. My trip rounded for 5 days, wherein i made\
  \ arrangements for living, food and other necessities on my own. Every single day\
  \ i spent brought something beautiful and blissful. I encountered the scenes I never\
  \ thought of like watching a tiger crossing a busy road to get to other end of the\
  \ park to drink water and have plentiful of shelter. Other instances like spotting\
  \ a cobra staring right through me with fangs opening to prepare itself in self\
  \ defence. These incredible moments that are unforgettable\nand taught me something\
  \ new always.\n\nTravelling have always been exciting and incredulous. It actually\
  \ teaches you that how much you love yourself despite of miseries and hay wired\
  \ life. Sitting alone in jungle with music in ears is something one can only experience\
  \ and cannot be defined. Other beautiful moment was a trip to famous place in India\
  \ like Kasol where you find yourself uniting with nature every single time you visit.\
  \ Those Serene sound of river flowing and water thrashing with big rocks and splashing\
  \ on the face have always been beautiful. That is where i found and realized what\
  \ nature has for you in boxed and want you to see at right time.\n\nThus I would\
  \ like to conclude by saying that never miss an opportunity to travel and explore\
  \ because you don't know what comes next and what impression it leaves."
