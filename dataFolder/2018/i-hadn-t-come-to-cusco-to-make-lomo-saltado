Text: "I hadn\u2019t come to Cusco to make lomo saltado in a smoky back kitchen of\
  \ a 19th-century hotel. But it happened and it changed everything. \n\nWith the\
  \ thin mountain air still sizzling from an earth-shaking Andean thunderstorm, I\
  \ slipped my coat on, grabbed my umbrella, and took to the now slick cobble-stoned\
  \ streets, already very late for the impromptu cooking lesson I had planned. It\
  \ didn\u2019t help that I had just moved into my apartment a day before, meaning\
  \ the 15-minute walk through still unfamiliar neighborhoods would be a series of\
  \ guesswork at every street corner.\n\nFortunately, there waiting for me by the\
  \ Plaza de Armas\u2019 illuminated fountain, were two familiar faces, new friends\
  \ from Spanish class, and a third I hadn\u2019t yet met, our unofficial cooking\
  \ instructor, I assumed.\n\nRicardo, he said warmly while extending his hand. Amber,\
  \ I responded, slightly thrown off by the handshake instead of the more customary\
  \ cheek kiss. Mucho gusto, I said.\n\nYou see, I had just moved to Cusco one month\
  \ before this meeting in the rain-soaked Plaza. The two familiar faces at the fountain\
  \ I had only just met days before and the invitation to join them for this cooking\
  \ lesson was accepted only hours ago.\n\nLife in Cusco was unfolding in bits and\
  \ bursts of chance encounters and spontaneous plans with fast friends. So, it shouldn\u2019\
  t have come as a surprise that this is exactly how I\u2019d meet the man I\u2019\
  d fall in love with. \n\nLugging our purchases back to the dark and damp kitchen\
  \ of the hotel Ricardo worked at, we dove into the cooking, taking turns behind\
  \ the knife, then the stove, Ricardo all the while nudging three non-cooks into\
  \ techniques far beyond our experience. Flames licked the pan, charring the red\
  \ pepper and flavoring the steak.\n\nAs the meal came together, so did we. Ricardo\
  \ and I, more so than either of us could have ever expected.\n\nI hadn\u2019t come\
  \ to Cusco, Peru to find love. But I did. And it happened in a smoky back kitchen\
  \ of a 19th-century hotel over a heaping plate of freshly prepared lomo saltado."
