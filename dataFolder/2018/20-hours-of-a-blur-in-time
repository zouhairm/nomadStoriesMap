Text: "While driving uphill and enduring the nonstop bouncing I kept thinking we were\
  \ lost in the middle of nowhere. Through a cloud of dust surrounding us I could\
  \ read the sign \u201CTunel Ogarrio\u201D. The only way to get to our destination\
  \ was going across a tunnel with sketchy lighting. A two-way road with just one\
  \ lane.\n\nAs we excited the tunnel built in 1897, I was transported to that foregone\
  \ time. We had arrived to Real de Catorce, a once thriving silver mining town, located\
  \ 3 hours from San Luis Potos\xED in M\xE9xico.\n \nHorses, hippies, locals and\
  \ what were sure to be tourists were among the wanderers I saw through the window.\
  \ Once a 40,000 population, today about 1,000 people call it their home.\n\nWalking\
  \ through the steep and rocky streets my boyfriend and I peeked inside the old beige\
  \ and gray stone facades. We visited bars and stores selling mainly paintings and\
  \ accessories. The Huicholes, natives of the region, insert the pop of color to\
  \ the dilapidated town with their colorful art, pieces as yarn paintings and beadwork.\n\
  \n\u201CExcuse me miss, I think you might like this.\u201D I heard someone call\
  \ while turning the corner of the Plaza Hidalgo. I saw a woman with a couple of\
  \ scarfs in her hands handing me a green one. With some deep wrinkles around her\
  \ eyes , they were looking directly into mine making it impossible to just walk\
  \ away and say no thank you. \n\nShe went on and on about the quality of the materials\
  \ and the techniques she used to make her scarves. She showed me three different\
  \ ways to wear them and made me practice her styles. I actually liked the scarf,\
  \ but I liked her much more. I asked about her family and her work. She was a mother\
  \ of 3 and had been living there since she was 13. She was not a Huichol, but worked\
  \ alongside them in the Plaza. \n\nShe made me poke a hole through the silk and\
  \ wool embroidery with my fist. This is a scam, I thought, and she is going to make\
  \ me pay for it. Turns out she was showing me the method I could use to easily repair\
  \ any holes so the piece could last forever. \n\nI felt her freedom and absolute\
  \ contentment, Most of all I felt she was empowered. She loved what she did. I will\
  \ never forget her sales pitch, it was the most honest and enthusiastic interaction\
  \ I had ever encountered.\n\nI paid for the scarf and asked her where we should\
  \ go next. We couldn\u2019t find the place, so we sat at a restaurant we picked\
  \ randomly, much as everything else we did those less than 24 hrs. in Real (as the\
  \ locals call it)."
