Text: "I met Gandhi on a saturday night in my hometown city. I was at La Verbena Bar\
  \ drinking Indio beer and listening to music played by \"Los Hijos del Rock Latino\"\
  \ and he was with some friends celebrating the 4th of July in Mexico.  \n\n\"My\
  \ name is Gaurav Gandhi. Do you speak English?\", he said. \n\n\"I do speak English\"\
  , I said, while thinking: \"Why would you come to a Spanish speaking country if\
  \ you don't know the language?\".\n\nOur conversation didn't last long, besides\
  \ the mandatory question: What is an Indian man doing in the last city in Mexico\
  \ you should be visiting? We exchanged numbers, and went our ways. Love, faith,\
  \ and the universe applying its power on us every moment, were not the ideas that\
  \ will get to a small town girl from Mexico. I considered myself skeptic until I\
  \ witnessed the ineffable, and the ineffable came to me a month after. \n\n\"Hello,\
  \ how have you been?\" That was the first of all the messages I would answer to\
  \ Gaurav Gandhi, the guy with the biggest brown eyes I had ever seen and who didn't\
  \ speak any Spanish.\n\nWhen I met him, I was in one of the most inconsistent stages\
  \ we go through in life. I was working in a job that disappointed me every day and\
  \ all I wanted to do was to eat the entire world, but the world wasn\u2019t in the\
  \ daily menu yet. The advice for the moment in social networks was: If you want\
  \ to change your life, travel. So I quit my job, sold my car and bought a flight\
  \ to Guatemala. Why Guatemala? The answer is as complicated as how simple it is\
  \ to summarize it in the practicality of the fact that it was the cheapest international\
  \ flight in that moment. \n\nAs Gandhi was already in my story, and between tales\
  \ and jokes, I cajoled him with my desires, he came with me to Guatemala. Our adventure\
  \ lasted two weeks. The country of the eternal spring had its effect on us, and\
  \ how not to have it, in front of those rivers with turquoise water, the deep green\
  \ of its trees, and the colonial architecture of Antigua City. We visited the archaeological\
  \ site of Tikal and hiked a long trail to get to the natural pools in Semuc Champey.\
  \ We contemplated the sunset together on Lake Atitl\xE1n and the Island of Flores,\
  \ which was breathtaking. \n\nWe spent three days enjoying the hot weather at the\
  \ beach in Monterico and we even witnessed the magical moment when the new born\
  \ sea turtles went into the sea for the first time. \n\nThe last day of the trip,\
  \ before saying goodbye, the last thing I was expecting happened.\n\n\"Do you want\
  \ to be my girlfriend?\", he asked."
