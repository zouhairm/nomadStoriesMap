Text: "I was wandering aimlessly and slightly bored, which is unusual for NYC but\
  \ I was more than satisfied from the night before and felt like going home. I had\
  \ been working for weeks straight. My first weekend off, I ran to NYC for a gallery\
  \ show and partied my ass off until 6am. That was hardly R&R. It began to rain,\
  \ I was slightly hungover and just didn't feel like doing it all over again. I stopped\
  \ into a rustic bar and ordered a bloody mary. I couldn't stop there. Once the alcohol\
  \ hit and gave me an appetite, an omelette and two more. My day started to look\
  \ up and feel a bit more motivated. The sun came out. Seize the day! Take this time\
  \ because I won't be back for a while! I walked about a half hour; a bit full, slightly\
  \ tipsy, no one interested me. I started to wander, wander, wander aimlessly, smoking\
  \ cigarettes with my cowboy walk. I noticed a guy swirling around people on the\
  \ street, snapping photos like a stealthy ninja. He snuck some of me as I walked\
  \ by. He stopped, crouched on the ground aiming across my path. I was about to step\
  \ into frame, so I paused to let him take the photo. He looked up with this big\
  \ white smile, kind with adventurous twinkle to his eyes. He waved me through and\
  \ snapped more! Haha! We gently followed eachother back and forth until I decided\
  \ I was being a little stalker and skipped into a gallery. I was in there for 20\
  \ minutes and then felt a rush. I was very satisfied but also extremely upset to\
  \ have let him slip away. What if?? \nI decided to play a game. Let the energy take\
  \ you. What looks good? What feels right? I wandered hoping magic exists. Sadly,\
  \ it had been so long my phone was dying, I had to pee and felt it a little desperate.\
  \ Maybe I did this for an hour? I stumbled upon the life savor of modern travel:\
  \ Starbucks. I waited for the restroom in a line that curled around the corner.\
  \ Finally relieved, I headed out to smoke a cigarette and who walks in the door\u2026\
  \ Yes! there is a God! The universe is good, science rocks, physics and all the\
  \ things I don't understand are working in my favor! Magic is real! We both sighed\
  \ with our bodies and immediately poured into each others interests, sharing our\
  \ art and likes. Eventually he said, \u201CDo you want to get a beer somewhere?\u201D\
  \ \u201CYES!\" We wandered everywhere, asking where it felt right, making out, walking\
  \ into on coming traffic. He said, what is it now? We meet each other and now we\
  \ can die? \"Yes, I thought.\""
