Text: "If I\u2019ve learned nothing else from traveling, it\u2019s that some things\
  \ you just have to say \u201Cyes\u201D to. Saying \u201Cyes,\u201D and accepting\
  \ experiences outside of my comfort zone, has allowed me to embrace more adventurous\
  \ travel on the road and opened up to me a new side of my home city of Seattle as\
  \ well. This is how I found myself accompanying one of my closest friends, Angel,\
  \ to his childhood friends\u2019 wedding in Guanajuato, Mexico. Guanjuato is a city\
  \ built into a ravine, with cheerful houses the color of every crayon imaginable\
  \ - from burnt orange to lime green to electric pink - butting up against one another.\
  \ The center of the town is dotted with church spires, indicating the church\u2019\
  s stronghold in the region. \n\nThe evening before their wedding, the bride and\
  \ groom invited all the wedding guests to join them for the callejoneada, a traditional\
  \ Spanish parade through the town\u2019s winding alleyways. We met them on the marble\
  \ steps in front of the Teatro Juarez. The bride, Juanita, and all the other ladies\
  \ wore colorful crowns of silk flowers and ribbons in their hair. Angel\u2019s sister,\
  \ who his family affectionately calls Tita and I purchased our own floral crowns\
  \ from the street vendors nearby. \n\nOnce a large crowd of wedding guests and a\
  \ few random strangers gathered in front of the theater, the party began. The estudiantinas,\
  \ (male students and musicians from the University of Guanajuato) dressed in red\
  \ and black velveteen outfits more suited for Spain in the 1500s than the modern\
  \ era, kicked off the festivities by playing a lively, romantic ballad for the soon-to-be\
  \ newlyweds. The gathered crowd of celebrants knew almost all the songs they sang\
  \ that night, and their voices joined those of the estudiantinas, raining down into\
  \ the central plaza. \n\nLed by the estudiantinas and the bride riding a burro,\
  \ the callejoneada marched from the central plaza up the steep and narrow winding\
  \ alleyways of the town towards the callejon del beso (alley of the kiss). The families\
  \ of the bride and groom passed out green ceramic frog flasks to all their guests\
  \ that they filled with golden tequila. The party was soon split into groups of\
  \ men and women. The women were taught the female chorus of the popular folk song\
  \ \u201CCielito Lindo\u201D which roughly translates to \u201CLovely Sweet One\u201D\
  \ in English. The men, led by the groom, came back to serenade their sweethearts\
  \ in the alleyway singing \u201CAy, ay, ay, ay, Canta y no llores, Porque cantando\
  \ se alegran, cielito lindo, los corazones.\u201D"
