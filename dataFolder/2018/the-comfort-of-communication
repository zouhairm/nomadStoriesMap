Text: "Sometimes, the right word makes all the difference. I only had a handful in\
  \ this language, so I\u2019d look for the right one by miming, smiling and gesturing\
  \ in what I hoped was a universal language. It was part fun, part stress and often\
  \ a failure. But it\u2019s what I had to try find a restaurant in Beijing\u2019\
  s hutongs, centuries old criss crossing alleys that were better for getting lost\
  \ in than finding the right word. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t working. \n\nI needed more\
  \ words. So I tried to match the symbols in the guide book with the names of the\
  \ restaurants. Genius, I thought. Until I got lost.\n\nIn my defence, the map was\
  \ wrong. But so was my logic, which for a guy not used to these temperatures, was\
  \ probably frozen. Because in a Latin script, there are a few dozen characters for\
  \ this matching game. Here, there were thousands. And this was the land of calligraphy.\
  \ Could that angled line in the book be the same as the curved one on the building?\
  \ Is that dot superfluous? If I wasn\u2019t careful, I\u2019d be taken by the ice,\
  \ frozen until spring. At least I would have time to contemplate the lettering.\n\
  \nI stood outside what I thought was the place for an age. A patron leaving looked\
  \ at me and jerked his head. \u2018Go in\u2019 he was saying, \u2018it\u2019s delicious\u2019\
  . I took his advice.\n\nA table of men were hunched over their meals, dropping cigarette\
  \ ash and chicken bones on the floor. Would I have to eat like that too? I didn\u2019\
  t think I could comfortably use the floor as a bin and thought about leaving, until\
  \ the waitress smiled.\n\nHer menu had pictures to help with the matching game.\
  \ But you can\u2019t smell or feel pictures, and the broccoli came cold. I figured\
  \ that was deliberate and I wished I was somewhere easier to navigate. \n\nAnd then\
  \ the stew I\u2019d come for arrived. That smell. My taste bud arousal was surely\
  \ universal. But despite the smell, the picture and the description in the book,\
  \ I was still lost. I knew what was meant to be in it, but the murky broth made\
  \ it a lucky dip. I picked up my chopsticks and reached in. Was this black and grey\
  \ gristly thing once part of a chicken? I put it with the untouched broccoli. Then\
  \ delicious potato and thick wheat noodles, with a taste to beat the smell. Then\
  \ more potato. No, garlic! But too late, and the acrid clove overpowered my taste\
  \ buds. Overwhelmed, I thought about leaving again. \n\nBut then the power went\
  \ off, and an almighty curse, the same as I might use in English, flew from the\
  \ kitchen. I smiled and tucked in, because I suddenly felt more at home."
