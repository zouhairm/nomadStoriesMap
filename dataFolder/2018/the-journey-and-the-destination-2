Text: "It was like the beginning of a bad joke: two out-of-shape gringos walk into\
  \ the Andes. Only in lieu of a funny punchline, all we had was an injured knee and\
  \ a sense of impending doom. My husband and I were hiking the Quilotoa Loop in Ecuador,\
  \ two months into our year-long backpacking honeymoon, and we were nowhere near\
  \ as fit as we\u2019d expected. Instead, we were just as overweight and under-prepared\
  \ as ever.\n\nOn Day One of our hike, we found ourselves hopelessly lost, frantically\
  \ searching for unmarked trails, asking locals for complicated directions in Spanish,\
  \ not understanding their replies in Quechua, and finally, crawling up a mountain\
  \ on our hands & knees.\n\nOn Day Two, we swallowed our pride and took a taxi.\n\
  \nA few hours into Day Three, we were still determined to finish this thing, but\
  \ instead it was finishing us. My husband could barely walk, grimacing with every\
  \ painful step. I was dehydrated, miserable, and on the verge of tears. We didn\u2019\
  t feel like fit, adventurous backpackers; all we felt was shame and defeat.\n\n\
  And then we saw her. Hobbling around the next turn was an old woman, dressed in\
  \ traditional Andean clothing: felt hat, brightly colored poncho, long skirt. She\
  \ walked with a cane, although I\u2019d wager she was moving faster than we were.\n\
  \nAs soon as she saw us, her face lifted into a giant, toothless smile. We must\
  \ have looked quite a sight: two red-faced gringos stumbling through the ancient\
  \ paths her Quechua ancestors had created centuries ago. But there was no judgement\
  \ on her wrinkled face. \n\nShe stretched out her hands, beckoning us. We limped\
  \ towards one another, like a slow-motion scene from Baywatch\u2019s much less sexy\
  \ sequel. \n\nWhen we finally reached her, she clasped our sweaty hands in her dry,\
  \ withered ones, beaming. She said nothing. We said nothing. We just grinned at\
  \ one another, her hands like well-worn leather.\n\nAlthough no words were exchanged,\
  \ it was a communication any traveler would recognize: Welcome.\n\nWe watched her\
  \ retreat and continued slowly along our way. The shadow hanging over us vanished,\
  \ and we blossomed in the sun. Here we were, amongst indigenous communities high\
  \ in the misty, rugged Andes Mountains of Ecuador, surrounded by patchworked cliffs\
  \ and grazing llamas. Finishing the hike no longer seemed to matter.\n\nWith less\
  \ than a mile to go, I flagged down a passing truck. As we pulled our aching, injured\
  \ bodies into the truck bed, the driver asked, \u201CHow was your hike?\u201D \n\
  \n\u201CIt was amazing,\u201D we said. \u201CIt was perfect.\u201D"
