Text: "Scotand. \n\nA beautiful place, with its untouched urban landscapes and its\
  \ cool blue skies make it one hell of a place to visit.\n\nVisiting a cousin of\
  \ mines wedding, helped me to witness the green and fresh horizon of the scottish\
  \ surroundings.\n\nIts a very calming place to be. Just taking a moment to stand\
  \ there and look across the glimmering rivers, mirroring the icy white peaks of\
  \ the mountain sides and the feeling of that nice silent breaze, kiss across your\
  \ face.\n\nLoch Lomond. More south of the country. The grass there is more of a\
  \ tinted green, and the wood of more sun-kissed light brown. A truly magnificent\
  \ place to see with the surrounding highlands.\n\nThe place shows a hint of how\
  \ the island of Britain would've looked like , way back at the beginning.  Completely\
  \ untouched in most parts. A true sight of bliss.\n\nThe people are friendly. Polite,\
  \ and know how to accompany a guest. In a way it mirrors the landscape of Scotland.\
  \ Both being taken seriously but at the same time showing you a glimpse's of sweetness\
  \ and joy.\n\nA great place to hold events such as weddings. Pictures of the place\
  \ would make you look back and think what a place it was.\n\nTruly Beautiful."
