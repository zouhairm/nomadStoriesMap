Text: "When the familiar whistle sound swept through the air and the train started\
  \ moving clumsily forward and then gradually picking up speed, I sat by the window\
  \ and cried. Last 24 hours were spinning before my eyes like a whirlpool. My head\
  \ was heavy, I was soaked up in sweat, I was exhausted but above all, I was feeling\
  \ relieved. \nI made it! I was on the train! Tomorrow noon I will be in Lhasa! Those\
  \ words  were resonating in my head as I watched the Qinghai lake slowly disappear\
  \ in the distance, sparkling in the afternoon sun. \nIt all started when I arrived\
  \ to the Chinese province of Qinghai and its capital city Xining a few days ago.\
  \ A big kidney stone that got stuck in my urinary tract was \u201Cblocking my way\u201D\
  \ to Tibet.  My trip almost ended there before it even started.\n\nOnly a few hours\
  \ before I was agonising in pain in one of the many hospitals I had visited in Xining\
  \ and around in the last few days, and now, by the stroke of luck or whatever it\
  \ might be, I was on my way to Lhasa. \nWhen the doctor who was about to help me\
  \ get rid of the stone said \u201D you can travel, but under your own risk\u201D\
  , I knew that it was the risk I had to take. I immediately picked up my phone and\
  \ told Carlos: \u201CPack all the luggage now, I\xB4ll meet you at the station\u201D\
  .\nI was thinking to myself: I simply can't miss this train. I can't give up on\
  \ my life-long dream to see Tibet, now that I am so close to fulfilling it: visitors\
  \ permits obtained, package-tour money already paid and seats secured on the highly-demanded\
  \ train from Xining to Lhasa leaving in a few hours.\n\u201C Nurse, help me take\
  \ away this infusion bag!\u201D I shouted as I cast nervous looks at the big clock\
  \ on the wall. The antibiotics infusion bag was dripping too slowly and I was running\
  \ out of time to catch the train. \u201COh, you have something urgent ?\u201D she\
  \ said. I smiled and nodded and then rushed out of the hospital, squeezing a bag\
  \ full of medicines in one hand while hailing a taxi with another.\nRunning through\
  \ the station, passing through the security control, rushing towards the train,\
  \ all this happened so quickly that I can hardly recall it.\nWhen the next day I\
  \ set foot in Lhasa, when later on I choked with the heavy incense smoke in front\
  \ of the Jokhang temple and cried with emotion in front of the mighty Potala, when\
  \ the clouds cleared allowing me to see the majestic Mt. Everest at Everest base\
  \ camp, I knew I had made the right decision.\n\u201CFortune sides with him who\
  \ dares.\u201D, Virgil once said. Fortune sided with me this time."
