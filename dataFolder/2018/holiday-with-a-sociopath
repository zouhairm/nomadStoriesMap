Text: "Very few times in your lifetime do you spend holiday- as the Brits say- with\
  \ a narcissistic sociopath on the getaway of a lifetime! Little did I know, the\
  \ Sicilian man I was traveling with would be the end of my rose colored glasses\
  \ I was wearing for years, but at least, I got a story out of it.\n\nI journeyed\
  \ to Tenerife, which is nestled around the Canary Islands and Spain, in Fall of\
  \ 2014. It's known as the place with the greatest aviation disaster in history,\
  \ a plethora of banana plantations, and where the Brits, the French, and basically\
  \ everyone near the geological location travel. My boyfriend and I traveled there\
  \ because he was involved with a pyramid scheme. It was his reward vacation and\
  \ the bait he used to dangle in front of me when we first met on Christian Mingle,\
  \ a well-known online dating service. \n\nAfter flying out of San Francisco, CA\
  \ to Manchester, England to a puddle jumper to the Island of Tenerife, Spain, I\
  \ was simply spellbound with the views, not only in the \"flying by the speed of\
  \ light\" van cabs but with the views from our hotel suite. \"Yes!\" I said to myself.\
  \ \"This little Okie Texas Cali girl has finally gone international, baby!\" The\
  \ ocean was the deep hues of royal to Tanzanite blues with winding dirt roads, ungodly\
  \ smelling banana forests and the sounds of the locals, Brits, French, Spanish peoples\
  \ clamoring about with such joyous rigor! Only to my disappointment, there was no\
  \ beach because Tenerife is a dormant volcanic island with such beautiful charm\
  \ and hypnotic ocean breezes. \n\nIt started out deceivingly normal with cocktail\
  \ parties, dinners, speeches, and everyone kissing my boyfriend's ass, because he\
  \ was some big wig in the company's infrastructure. He showed me off like a prized\
  \ cow and a trophy wifey. Frankly, that was normal to me being I was from LA at\
  \ the time and a model/actress with a unconventional stand-up comedy career on the\
  \ rise. He never danced with me, flirted with all the married and single women and\
  \ took particular interest in leaving me to fend for myself.  I didn't see it as\
  \ a red flag at the time because I was drinking large quantities of the locally\
  \ made, lethal Sangria! God bless the Spaniards for that concoction! It truly is\
  \ the nectar from their gods. \n\nFrom the sunrise to sunset, I wandered aimlessly,\
  \ perfectly independent speaking my broken Tex-Mex Spanish to the locals, sunbathing\
  \ myself by the infinity pools Oceanside, people watching the international eye\
  \ candy and drinking Sangria! Cheers!"
