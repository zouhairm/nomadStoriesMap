Text: "\u201CJust call me Marquise\u201D\nShe reaches for the glasses hanging from\
  \ her neck and gently places them on the tip of her nose, while slowly bending to\
  \ fetch a bottle from the fridge. I glance around. It\u2019s the tiniest bar I have\
  \ ever been in. The walls are peppered with old model ships. Three tables with worn\
  \ out checkered cloths face a wooden paneled counter that must be at least thirty\
  \ years old. Somehow appropriately, Asinello, the aromatic blond wine Marquise is\
  \ now pouring in my glass, is made from a recipe that has been around for well over\
  \ a century. \n\n\u201CHow do you like it?\u201D\nThe wine tastes liquorish and\
  \ sweet altogether, like a stingier, rawer version of Porto. I nod my approval and\
  \ gesture her to replenish my glass, where a small piece of lemon peel now sits\
  \ lonely at the bottom. When she smiles Marquise\u2019s wrinkles become alive, like\
  \ a web of friendly dimples.\n\nOutside it\u2019s late-afternoon and the impossibly\
  \ narrow streets of Genoa\u2019s historical center are empty. The city looks like\
  \ a movie-set from the \u201860s, frozen out of time while waiting for its actors\
  \ to return from their afternoon break. \n\n\u201CThere are gonna be a lot of people\
  \ here. Soon. Young ones\u201D\nA man in his fifties stumbles into the room from\
  \ a backdoor. He\u2019s trying to stuff his shirt back into his trousers. The operation\
  \ is made complex by the fact that he\u2019s holding a pirate hat in his right hand\
  \ and some sort of plastic saber in his left one. \n\n\u201CThat\u2019s why it\u2019\
  s so empty in here today. We don\u2019t like outsiders\u201D\nHe grimaces while\
  \ waving his hand around as to include a full room of young ones. Then grins and\
  \ walks up to me. His cheeks are purple and the capillaries in his nose are all\
  \ busted up. A drinker.\n\n\u201CAsinello, eh? Drink one on me before leaving\u201D\
  \nHe slaps a few coins on the counter and makes his muttering exit.\n\n\u201CHe\
  \ works for a restaurant down at the Old Port. They\u2019re trying to lure tourists\
  \ in with this pirate thing\u201D offers Marquise as explanation. \u201CSome kids\
  \ shot a music video here a few months ago. They\u2019re showing it later today.\
  \ You should stay\u201D she adds. \u201CMost of my regulars are in the video. They\
  \ actually went home to change. They\u2019re a bit old fashioned like that. Or,\
  \ you know, old altogether\u201D Marquise laughs away.\n\nI stay. The bar is packed\
  \ with architectural students and old timers. Two suspicious tribes studying each\
  \ other. I observe them while the alcohol and the occasional dirty joke melt their\
  \ barriers away. \u201CThey are one now\u201D a wrinkle smiles by my side."
