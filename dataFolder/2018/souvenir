Text: "Souvenirs. At first it was a stuffed Paddington Bear from London. A bear with\
  \ a red little overcoat and a blue hat. As I got older and traveled more, my souvenirs\
  \ turned into wooden ukuleles from the Bahamas and chipotle spices from Dallas.\
  \ It got more practical. My favorite souvenir, however, is not. It\u2019s a pair\
  \ of green and yellow water shoes.\n I was in Montego Bay, Jamaica with my siblings,\
  \ and my sister signed us up for what I thought was a Safari ride. While we\u2019\
  re sitting on the bus just looking out at the colorful brick stores and green Royal\
  \ palms, we\u2019re told we have to purchase water shoes for the waterfall we\u2019\
  re about to climb. I immediately turn to my sister, and she freezes.\nI love being\
  \ spontaneous, and it was actually out of my element to not want to try something\
  \ new. Fear brings out a side of us that we didn\u2019t realize was present. I was\
  \ being irrational saying I didn\u2019t want to do it and rolling my eyes at my\
  \ sister for not realizing what we signed up for.\nWhen we arrived at the waterfall,\
  \ I remember looking at how high we were about to climb and wanted to run into the\
  \ ocean instead. Dunn's River Falls is a famous waterfall near Ocho Rios and a major\
  \ Caribbean tourist attraction. My eyes rested on a little girl. She looked about\
  \ 8 years old and was wearing a little purple flower printed dress. Meanwhile, I\
  \ was a 21 year old adult quivering in my water shoes. \nWe walked into the waterfall.\
  \ The rocks each had a few spots to climb as we continued up the waterfall. \u201C\
  What the crap is that?\u201D my sister asked.\nIt was a rocky little slide into\
  \ a pool of menacing water.\nWhen it was my turn, I slid into the water, and my\
  \ body submerged into the blue water. I stayed down for a second and tried looking\
  \ downward until someone finally pulled me up. \nAfter surviving that slide, climbing\
  \ didn\u2019t seem too bad. As we finished our hike, I read a wooden sign that read\
  \ \u201CYou\u2019ve just climbed Dunn\u2019s Waterfall.\u201D As I got to the top,\
  \ there was a little terrace area that people could take photos. It was cloudy,\
  \ but the rosy blush colored sky was shadowed by the prettiest palm trees. \nInstead\
  \ of taking photos, I leaned against the railing overlooking the waterfall alone\
  \ as a  breeze of wind went through my wispy wet black hair. Dunn\u2019s River Falls\
  \ extends across more than 600 feet and is 180 feet high. Maybe to some adventurers,\
  \ that seems like nothing. To me, it was a major accomplishment. I turned to my\
  \ siblings.  \u201CSo what\u2019s next?\u201D I asked them."
