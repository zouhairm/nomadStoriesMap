Text: "Chilly wind rips through the stone doorway. Overhead, broody skies toss and\
  \ turn. Even in storm, the Incan ruins of Huchuy Qosqo are peaceful and steadfast.\
  \ My Peruvian companions and I sit in contemplation, unusually quiet. When we leave,\
  \ snowflakes float from the sky. Julio and Richard, who always like to augment the\
  \ moment with music, crank up the song \u201CLatinoam\xE9rica\u201D by Calle 13\
  \ on a cracked iPhone.\n One would be hard-pressed to stumble upon Huchuy Qosqo\
  \ without already knowing it was there. It sits on a mountaintop overlooking the\
  \ Sacred Valley in the Andes, invisible from below. Most unusually, there are no\
  \ tourist buses in sight. There is no access by public road; people come on foot\
  \ or by motorbike.\n Julio, a local farmer, showed me Huchuy Qosqo when I worked\
  \ at his family\u2019s farm. Skinny but remarkably strong, Julio has boundless energy\
  \ and a surprising giggle of a laugh. He has Incan ancestry but seldom visits Incan\
  \ ruin sites. Julio has never been to Machu Picchu. \u201CIt\u2019s for the tourists!\u201D\
  \ he cries, arguing that he has no place in their photo-snapping crowds. In a twisted\
  \ irony, as a dark-skinned farmer, he feels unwelcome at most Incan ruin sites.\
  \ Such spaces are\u2014explicitly or not\u2014reserved for foreign tourists. They\
  \ are not for locals and especially not farmers like Julio, even if his ancestors\
  \ built those very ruins.\n Unlike most sites, Huchuy Qosqo\u2019s ruins feel local,\
  \ with farmers tending fields right by them. Without signage and tourist marketing,\
  \ they aren\u2019t frozen in history yet. Rather, they are involved in the lives\
  \ of locals sowing potatoes and playing flute, grazing cows and drying maize; they\
  \ are a part of living history.\n The site is about to change radically. A Swiss\
  \ engineering company is building a gondola from the town of Calca up to the ruins.\
  \ Soon, the ruins will transform into a tourist destination. The gondola will attract\
  \ tourist dollars, but locals have had to fight to share in the profits. After protest,\
  \ Calca won a small cut, but the lion\u2019s share will leave the area. \n As I\
  \ picture the gondola, I recall my first visit to Huchuy Qosqo. It was beautiful\
  \ to see ruins not roped off for tourists but integrated into local life. They were\
  \ open to anyone who ventured up, even a local farmer whose ancestors helped to\
  \ build those stone terraces and halls. As we left, \u201CLatinoam\xE9rica\u201D\
  \ swelled from the cracked iPhone: \u201CI\u2019m what they left/ I\u2019m the remainder\
  \ of what they stole/ A village hidden at the top/ I\u2019m Latin America.\u201D"
