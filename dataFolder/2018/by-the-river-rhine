Text: "I travelled to Cologne on one fine weekend when I was in Holland. Brussels\
  \ was my first choice for that specific weekend but then one of my childhood wish\
  \ turned my feet towards Cologne. Sometimes these chronic wishes become a powerful\
  \ reason for your wandering soul.\nAfter visiting the Cathedral, I made my way towards\
  \ the bank of the Rhine where I found the overflow of love in shape of love padlocks\
  \ them clinging to the Hohenzollern Bridge over the Rhine , love which is an ancient\
  \ species after the emergence & influence of the Manhattan\u2019s style of love.\
  \ \nCan we lock love?\nA manly voice echoed from the left of my side & I was about\
  \ to jump as he scared me to death. Oh No, not at all, I responded after giving\
  \ it a thought.\nThis time he laughed, he was a tall guy with slightly tanned skin,\
  \ curly hair, & Spanish looks. There was a sort of content in his hazel eyes. You\
  \ know what, said the guy, lovers sign their names onto a padlock & then throw the\
  \ key into the river below. He gazed towards the stencilled phrase over the tarmac\
  \ road \u201CLove is only a four-letter word.\u201D What you think about this, he\
  \ asked.\nNot for everyone, I replied.\nWho are you girl & what brought you here.\
  \ He asked.\nOne of my dreams, I took a moment then replied and raised my hand.\
  \ This diary brought me here, I added.\nHe took the diary & opened it; confusion\
  \ was visible in his hazel eyes. Can you interpret the script of your diary? He\
  \ asked.\nIt has my tiny little dreams of my childhood, the eternal truths of life,\
  \ & so many untold stories; which can\u2019t be interpreted in any language.  I\
  \ have brought it here to give it to the Rhine, can I trust Rhine? I replied.\n\
  Let\u2019s solve the puzzle; he started walking towards the bank of the river. \
  \ He stopped when we reached near the bank, where the cold green blue water was\
  \ hugging our feet.\nI was in complete trance, he gave back the diary & said, now\
  \ talk to the river whatever you want to say.\nA melancholic frozen breeze touched\
  \ my cheeks, & I whispered;\n\u201COh Rhine, now onward you are the keeper of my\
  \ tiny little dreams, & my most unforgettable stories of life\u201D.\nWith these\
  \ words, I threw my precious little world forcefully in Rhine.\nThe diary disappeared\
  \ somewhere underneath the blue & green water.\nWhen I turned back, he was still\
  \ there. Why Rhine? He asked.\nJust to fulfill a promise with a little girl, I replied.\
  \ While ignoring so many questions in his eyes, I started walking towards the Chocolate\
  \ Museum where a world of divine taste was waiting for me."
