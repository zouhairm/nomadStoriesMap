Text: "My sisters and I walked out into the plaza, stomachs filled with beer and mussels\
  \ yet still unprepared for the emptiness of the cold. Though the Grand Square in\
  \ the middle of Brussels had grown into our home base on this family trip, rivaled\
  \ only by the mulled wine and waffles of the 200 stands in the Christmas market,\
  \ we were ready to return to our hotel and interact with the world via window.\n\
  \ \n\u201CHey, let\u2019s take the long way back.\u201D There were no audible groans\
  \ to my dad\u2019s suggestion but I felt the post-dinner quiet gel into a tense\
  \ silence. Our day trip north to Bruges to see canals and lace stores meant an early\
  \ morning and our civility was thinning like snow under car tires.\n \n\u201CC\u2019\
  mon girls, it\u2019ll be nice. We only have another day or two here.\u201D\n \n\u201C\
  Can I get a waffle?\u201D My youngest sister asked, glancing down the paved stones\
  \ that led to the skating rink and stands. \n \nI looked at my older sister. Covert\
  \ cigarettes and monk-made beer could only carry one so far and I could see her\
  \ forming a way to navigate, tactfully, to bed.\n\n\u201CUm, dad\u2014\u201D She\
  \ began.\n\nThen, the music started. Joy to the World rung out as freshly as if\
  \ first released, the lines bouncing across the square and ricochetting from stone\
  \ to stone as different buildings responded in color\u2014the columns on the museum\
  \ blushing red when the steeple on the church shone gold. Soon, purple and white\
  \ and green chimed in as harmonies stacked then swelled into patterns high around\
  \ us. The 30-foot tall Christmas tree stood in the middle like a conductor, as calmly\
  \ merry as a parent watching children open gifts.\n \nWe were well past the age\
  \ of wonderment. But when we were too little for anything except dollhouses and\
  \ swing sets, our eyes would go marvel-wide when our grandfather stopped at red\
  \ lights, just to predict perfectly when they would change to green. Before we discovered\
  \ the trick of perpendicular yellow traffic light, we would watch him carefully\
  \ at every stop, waiting for our oracle to speak.\n\n\u201COne, two\u2026\u201D\
  \ then the squeals as the light changed and we all felt a simple reassurance that\
  \ magic did indeed exist and was somewhere in our blood.\n\nBut now, years later,\
  \ we were unprepared for the taste of wonder. We stayed for the entire show, pivoting\
  \ at each shift in color as we forgot the cold and impending train ride to turn\
  \ our faces up, searching for where the light would go next.\n\n\nFor more information\
