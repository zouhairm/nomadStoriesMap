Text: "Trying to budge in the crowd with the two luggages struggling a bit I finally\
  \ reached the main gate of the railway station. After a second of pandiculation,\
  \ with my smiling eyes behind the shades the sun was exact 180 degree to me. January\
  \ was never so hot and the excitement never so high. \n      Our bus bumped into\
  \ traffic but the next moment it was cleared, Agra changed a lot in these five years.\
  \ At least the potholes are gone. \n      Quarter past two, I was pacing to the\
  \ lane that connects the Taj Mahal\u2019s entrance gate behind the old trees I got\
  \ some glimpses of it. The breeze was better with pinch of relief. Memories revived\
  \ it was the same gate, standing at the horizon with a pitch dark inside Taj Mahal\
  \ slayed as always. \n       The guide in the congregate directed about the red\
  \ sandstone archways that frame the central mausoleum perfectly, its symmetrical\
  \ perfection, the master piece of eternal love, its decorative calligraphy. I have\
  \ been to Taj and its history everyone knows it. I stood a way out to discover it\
  \ in my ways. History can only be read but experiences can be shared and that becomes\
  \ your own history. The elation and confidence drawn me towards the garden pathway\
  \ with a pool positioned to reflect the mausoleum. It was an unending paradise when\
  \ I came across Princess Diana Bench, which was more crowded than the tomb and there\
  \ you meet some most annoying photographers. \n         Sundays are more crowded\
  \ than others, but the pietra dura inlaid stone work, botanical garden, jade and\
  \ agate, Arabic calligraphy pays it all. Carrying only a bottle and smartphone was\
  \ a smart option both from security and exhausting two hour walk. Returning back\
  \ through the garden area and the long queue after visiting the tomb, sitting on\
  \ the steps it was twilight with border less flow of clarity, the vast empty sky\
  \ with several hues stretched out for infinity and the sun\u2019s last stroke gave\
  \ Taj a curve of smile as of first love or that on brides face maybe similar to\
  \ the Mumtaj for whom it was made. Back at horizon and agreeing the myths I turned\
  \ back and exclaimed,\u201D Call me again\u201D. Maybe I get third time lucky. For\
  \ me Taj Mahal is surreal and is admired for a reason. Love is pure and so is mine.\
  \ Hope to rewind this journey soon with love of my life.    \n Thank you"
