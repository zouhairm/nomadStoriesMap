Text: "Skagastr\xF6nd is a tiny blip of a town. It\u2019s one of those towns you can\
  \ pass by on a cross-country road trip, and wonder, who actually lives there? A\
  \ small fishing town of less than 500 people, Skagastr\xF6nd is nestled on one of\
  \ the northernmost peninsulas of Iceland, only a few degrees away from the Arctic\
  \ Circle. I had been living there for 3 of the darkest, coldest winter months, \n\
  \ Skagastr\xF6nd is made up of about eleven streets. M\xE1nabraut, the street I\
  \ was living on, didn\u2019t even exist on Google Maps. The only caf\xE9 in town\
  \ serves soup of the day, and \u2018The Hot Meal\u2019, which changes daily. The\
  \ closest liquor store is in the next town over. The same can be said for a doctor\
  \ \u2013 you have to travel for booze or bruises. As soon as you reach the horse\
  \ paddocks, you are departing civilisation, and entering a hinterland of empty roads\
  \ and snowy plateaus.\n Mark\xFAs looks as close to a Viking as anything \u2013\
  \ full beard, sleeve tattoos, and a stature that can command a room \u2013 but he\
  \ speaks with a surprising and gnarly Californian accent. Splitting his time between\
  \ Iceland and California, he is a chef by trade, and a surfer by passion. \n \u201C\
  Surfer?\u201D I ask, \u201CWhat are the waves in California like?\u201D\n \u201C\
  Good, very different to here.\u201D\n \u201CHere? As in \u2013 Iceland? You surf\
  \ in Iceland too?\u201D\n I soon learned that Mark\xFAs is one of around only 40\
  \ daredevils who surf the freezing waters of Iceland. They navigate the Icelandic\
  \ sea by wearing dry suits, which retain heat and prevent hypothermia in waters\
  \ that are regularly -40 degrees Celsius. Still, their faces are exposed to sub-arctic\
  \ temperatures, making surfing in Iceland a perilous feat, and a lure for thrill\
  \ seekers. A few days after I met Mark\xFAs, some foreigners rolled into town in\
  \ a green Monster energy van and dove surfboard-first into the small, but choppy\
  \ waves. I watched them surf, snow falling on the shore in thick clumps, blue-purple\
  \ like bruises, gusts of wind raging incessantly across the sea.\n Skagastr\xF6\
  nd could easily be just another complicated name on a map to gloss over. The daylight\
  \ is short, the days dark, the world far more desolate. But to gloss over it is\
  \ to be deprived of luminous sunsets pulsing orange and pink against a frigid sea,\
  \ wild surf carrying chunks of ice onto a black beach. The surfers know and respect\
  \ these waters, knowing that at any minute they could be dragged under the rip and\
  \ frozen to death. But still, they choose to come all the way to the end of the\
  \ earth, just to catch a wave."
