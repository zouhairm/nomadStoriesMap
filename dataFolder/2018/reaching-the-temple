Text: "Sri Lanka, with its charm and aromatic teas, spices, such as cinnamon pepper\
  \ and its picturesque coastline, high mountains, no alarming volcanoes, a vast number\
  \ of endemic animals, indigenous plants and more; is fervently a place to visit.\
  \ \n\nMy day of arrival, I make heave from the hotel to head towards a Temple I\
  \ wanted to visit. I walk on by as the stall sellers vociferate over to me trying\
  \ to sell their goods. I respond in Italian they were confused; as I merely wanted\
  \ to head towards the Temple and wasn't too interested in what they were selling;\
  \ stating in Italian I couldn't speak English hoping for a more blissful walk. I\
  \ arrive to my destination and thinking to myself 'I've finally arrived at the temple\
  \ I can now go back to speaking in English' however to my amazement most of the\
  \ gentlemen I bumped into required money of which I found most odd. I began paying\
  \ a couple of them however to my surprise at the corner of my eye I spotted a charity\
  \ box so I informed these gents 'I see a charity box, I'll place the money in there\
  \ for you.' Suddenly I strolled off. \n\nBeing a frequent traveller I have experienced\
  \ this form of approach in many other countries too however - the last thing I expected\
  \ when having reached the Temple as I equip myself in order to be comfortable in\
  \ crossing my legs in preparation for my meditation; I slowly began closing my eyes,\
  \ took a deep breath and dedicated the time to myself in order for me to relish\
  \ some form of relaxation however at the point of letting go I hear a voice whispering\
  \ in my left ear stating 'I know which hotel you are from' This has never occurred\
  \ to me before I mean I do not recall hearing voices when meditating. I did ignore\
  \ it at first though unfortunately not for long because once again a whispering\
  \ voice echoed in my ear with the exact same phrase. I had no choice but to turn\
  \ my head and as I opened my eyes there he was crossed legged beside me repeating\
  \ the exact same words. I smiled though had to come up with a quick plan. I moved\
  \ and ran for it. I find a quiet corner outside and sit myself down. \n\nThe procession\
  \ began and hundreds of children fled from the building some approached me in order\
  \ to feel and touch my skin. As the procession passed me by, a flock of ladies in\
  \ cotton white robes followed and the last lady left me a tray of fruits. I felt\
  \ rather overwhelmed. On my way back to the hotel I walked on bended knees surrounding\
  \ myself within a family hoping I wouldn't get spotted by the anthropoid."
