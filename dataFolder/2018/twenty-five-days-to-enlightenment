Text: My yoga studio had decided to run in house teacher training but made it clear
  that only two teachers were needed. The price would be $2500, for a two month training.
  Having been a student of theirs for 8 years I was a bit miffed at their idea and
  it seemed to be that the ball was very much in their court. If I took a 200 hour
  teacher training sanctified by Yoga Alliance an international certifying body, I
  would be able to teach anywhere not just in their studio. I looked on line in a
  bit of a furor over their plan and found that I could take a 25 day intensive teacher
  training in Costa Rica, for the same price, plus airfare. In fact, I am sitting
  in a cute boutique hotel in San Jose as I write this having finished the grueling
  course and receiving my certificate. Graduation was two days ago on Friday and I
  had the privilege of teaching the last class. Since then I have been working my
  way back to San Jose from Uvita four hours south, getting set to take my flight
  back to Arizona early Monday morning. This trip was a personal achievement for me
  since I went by myself for nearly a month, traveled by bus to a few towns on the
  coast when we had weekends off, and not knowing the language was fairly good and
  making the locals understand me. Using my free download English to Spanish app didn't
  hurt either. I had never traveled this far this long alone and at my age 67, this
  was an accomplishment that I am proud of. Costa Rica is a glorious country lush
  with vegetation due to the vast amount of rainfall they receive. I understand now
  why their motto is 'Pura Vida." Namaste.
