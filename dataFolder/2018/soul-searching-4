Text: "\u201CI know it is here somewhere\u201D I think to myself.\n   \nI had recently\
  \ read an article about an art installation that intrigued me, but where is it?\n\
  \nI am at the Jewish Museum in Berlin and am becoming increasingly frustrated. It\
  \ feels like I have explored the museum entirely however what I am looking for is\
  \ yet to be found. Just as I am about to abandon my search, I see something intriguing\
  \ in the distance.\nI begin walking down this long empty hallway toward the puzzling\
  \ space ahead.\n    \nI have a feeling that I shouldn\u2019t be here. There is no\
  \ one else around and it is uncomfortably silent. I begin to wonder if this irritating\
  \ struggle to arrive here could be intentional. I turn a sharp corner and immediately\
  \ fall still. I am now facing a long narrow corridor. It is concrete on all sides.\
  \ Light is coming in from a modest window three stories above. At the other end\
  \ is a dark void, the exit I assume, as there is no where else to go.\n    \nFrom\
  \ where I stand, all the way to the dark abyss opposite me, the entire floor is\
  \ filled with thousands of morbid faces cut from steel looking upward. These endless\
  \ faces show fear, torture and agony. \n    \nI begin to move forward toward the\
  \ exit fifty feet away. I feel wrong but I proceed. With my first step I look down\
  \ to the evoking expressions staring back at me. I immediately feel disgust wash\
  \ over my whole body. I take a second step trying to be gentle and quiet but every\
  \ move I make results in a clambering of steel as the faces grind against each other\
  \ under my feet. Anguished echos fill the space all around me. Overcome with a sense\
  \ of guilt and sorrow, I retreat, unable to continue. A powerful symbolic message\
  \ sinks in as the artists intentions are now obvious to me.\n   \nI wonder now,\
  \ \u201CDid I find what I was looking for\u201D?"
