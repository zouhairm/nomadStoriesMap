Text: "It was January, the time of peak winter in the north of India. And crazy enough\
  \ as me and three of my friends are, we packed our bags all set to leave from Mumbai\
  \ to Manali, which is located in the state of Himachal Pradesh alongside The mighty\
  \ Himalayas. \nLooking out the window of the train, I realized how fortunate I was\
  \ to be born in a country with such magnificent beauty. All through the journey\
  \ I was capturring the mesmerizing beauty of my mother land with my camera. As we\
  \ reached closer to our destination the air outside started getting cold and the\
  \ wind coming inside would bring shiver down our spines. We dressed up to combat\
  \ the cold, ate supper and slept like logs.\nFast forward 24 hours and we were checking\
  \ in at our hotel in Manali. We were completely exhausted from the long haul and\
  \ to add the icing on the cake, the cold did not spare us. In short, we were a total\
  \ mess. We freshened up and finally felt as if our souls had been returned to us\
  \ by the almighty. Not knowing much about the place we asked siri (iphone) for help.\
  \ She came up with suggestions. But, since we love challenges and since my destiny\
  \ had something planned for me we ignored all those suggestions and instead chose\
  \ a random mountain trek which unknowingly was one of the most challenging and to\
  \ some extent deadly as stated by some expert mountaineers. Excitedly, we started\
  \ packing our bags. \nThe place was magnificently beautiful with heavy sheets of\
  \ fresh snow that had fallen a week ago. We all thought this would be an amazing\
  \ experience for all of us but my stomach and my intuition said something else.\
  \ \nWe were nearly half hour into the trek, when the snow started getting deeper.\
  \ Panting, I started weighing out the odds of us coming back the same path alive\
  \ when the next moment i felt a sudden rush of adrenaline in my body. I had placed\
  \ my foot in the wrong area. It was hollow underneath the blanket of snow and my\
  \ legs were dangling in that dark area while my hands had gripped on to a boulder.\
  \ I felt death was inevitable and almost started reading my prayers when i heard\
  \ my friends scream and come running towards me. All of a sudden, my body came with\
  \ this extraordinary amount of energy. I summoned up all my strength and with a\
  \ little help from my friends came out of hell.\nThe decision of taking the road\
  \ less traveled despite knowing the dangers associated with it made me test my limits.\
  \ After all, what is travelling if we don't have any stories to tell when we go\
  \ back home."
