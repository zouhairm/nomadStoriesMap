Text: "Last February I flew to Iceland in hopes of viewing the aurora borealis.  I\
  \ know they were dancing up above my head because my son saw them out the window\
  \ throughout his entire flight from California.  Alas, my search continues.  While\
  \ the Northern Lights are very active in the skies of Iceland, so are the wet weather\
  \ systems.  The wind can make standing vertically a challenge, much less waiting\
  \ in the wind for a chance break in the clouds.  What to do while waiting?  I bathed\
  \ in natural hot springs until well poached.  I sampled local cuisine including\
  \ Aquavit and fermented shark, and boiled eggs in water right out of the earth,\
  \ and a little too close to my bathing.  I had mud smeared on me which was supposed\
  \ to improve my complexion, and did improve my camouflage, enabling connections\
  \ with younger folk in the Blue Lagoon.  I attempted to sleep in a clear bubble\
  \ tent in the woods with warm air pumping under the mattress.  My sleep was disturbed,\
  \ not by aurora as planned, but by my stomach revolting violently at the aged shark\
  \ and alcohol combo earlier consumed.  I hiked on a glacier with crampons that could\
  \ have tenderized an old elk, and fortunately was not bothered by the active volcano\
  \ lying under the glacier.  I gazed across the mossy green lava, pondering the remains\
  \ of the largest lava flow the world has ever seen, responsible in part for revolutions\
  \ around the world in the late 1700's.  Icelandic politicians have a keen sense\
  \ of the relative impact of natural phenomena v. anything they can dream up, but\
  \ still almost crashed their economy in the first tech stock crash in the 80's.\
  \  I tried to buy wool from Icelandic sheep, but found it so coarse, I would first\
  \ need gloves to knit it, and some astonishingly impervious long underwear to wear\
  \ anything made from it.\n\nI remain committed to my search for the Northern Lights,\
  \ and think perhaps Finland is a destination with a better opportunity for success.\
  \ The American reality series, The Bachelor was able to go there in winter and successfully\
  \ film aurora while participants rode in furry sleighs, visited rustic wooded cabins,\
  \ and ice skated without hurting themselves.  I would like to do all of those things\
  \ too, but especially, I want to view the Northern Lights.  I have some traveling\
  \ years remaining, but I understand the solar storm season is coming to a close,\
  \ possibly for decades.  \n\nThis goal has risen to the top of my heap, and my dedication\
  \ is increasing to find my own aurora in the sky."
