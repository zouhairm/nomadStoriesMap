Text: "\"Why did I wear white sneakers?\" That's the first thought I have when I step\
  \ off the airport shuttle into a dirt road as red as a Roland Garros tennis court.\
  \ Alice Springs, located in Australia's geographic centre, holds less than 28,000\
  \ people and its mostly known for its remote destination and troubled aboriginal\
  \ communities that surround it. I look at the rough, almost abandoned look of the\
  \ town and the few bars with a desperate hipster vibe around me and start regretting\
  \ my decision. Trying to escape the hoards of backpackers that roam around the australian\
  \ cities and the coastal towns, I decided to check out the so-called \"red centre\"\
  , the only place that could offer me some comfort, or so I thought. \nI stroll through\
  \ the cobbled street and all I see is some closed thrift shops, deserted souvenir\
  \ stores and a very cloudless, blue sky that catches my eye. I check in at my equally\
  \ rough looking hostel and as I walk to my room I see a sign that reads \"Parrtjima:\
  \ A Festival of light\". It describes a festival that celebrates the australian\
  \ indigenous culture and customs. Curiosity strikes over me so after a quick internet\
  \ search I immediatly book myself a ticket for tonight after sunset, oh how easy\
  \ it is to be a backpacker nowadays. \nIt doesn't take much time for the bus to\
  \ leave the town behind, five minutes and I find myself with no reception in my\
  \ phone and, as I look out the window, one of the most unique landscapes I have\
  \ experienced. Beyond the flat, red land, the West MacDonnell Ranges arise, lit\
  \ up with the evening sun they turn into a shade of orange I didn't think was possible\
  \ for rocks. I begin to feel a bit more excited as I arrive my destination.\nIt's\
  \ dark when I step off into an amazing sight. Aboriginal art has been projected\
  \ onto the dry land and different patterns and colours move along with me. I walk\
  \ through the light-guided paths that take me to a dome that transports me to houndreds\
  \ of years ago and tells me legends and stories that connects me to their past.\
  \ The ranges have been lit up not by the sun now, but by projections of local birds\
  \ that hover around them like in the legends. Looking up I see that the blue skies\
  \ have been replaced by thousands of stars and an impossibly bright moon. The dance\
  \ show starts and I can almost see the history moving the bodies of the dancers\
  \ in a way that feels almost ancestral. \nI look down to my no longer white sneakers\
  \ and suddenly the dirt doesn't bother me as much as it did this morning."
