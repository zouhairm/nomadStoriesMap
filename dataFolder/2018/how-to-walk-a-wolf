Text: "When ice is black, it does not reflect the sky. It swallows light and keeps\
  \ it under a glassy face the same way tar coats weeds on the side of a road. Black\
  \ ice does not look like ice, but like a furious river frozen in a long-exposure\
  \ photograph. In the photograph motion is only implied. You don\u2019t feel the\
  \ current rushing you away, but you know it is there and that it aches to drown\
  \ you. At home the ice rinks are mute, and solid through to the bottom. Skating\
  \ on public ice rinks prepares you for skating on black ice the way walking a retriever\
  \ prepares you for walking a wolf. The ice rinks at home are not an endless mouth,\
  \ they are safe and calculated and falling through never enters your mind. This\
  \ was my first mistake. \n\nCold water is sluggish but is quick when it takes life:\
  \ this is what Marta told me, who was far ahead of me on the ice now. We made shy\
  \ scars on the face of the lake, always running from the sound of snapping branches\
  \ behind us. We were mallets booming on an endless gong, on the thin skin of ice\
  \ stretched tight across a black vortex. I had come to do Nordic skating because\
  \ I wanted to hear the vibrating ice for myself, to experience this trick of physics\
  \ I had only read about. But in that silent world, I did not prepare myself for\
  \ the unearthly shriek that followed our skates and echoed and cut up the grey air.\
  \ Above us a huge black mass of crows flew silently like a dream or a nightmare.\
  \ \n\nBefore we began Marta had stabbed her pole into the skin of the lake and measured\
  \ while the black underneath oozed out like a crime scene. You should wear a wetsuit\
  \ and prepare yourself. The shock is what you need to get through, because it\u2019\
  s not the water that kills you but your own panic. This is what they tell you, and\
  \ this is what rings in your skull as you try not to pay attention to the fractures\
  \ forming webs beneath your feet. We raced, and beneath us the ancient water flowed\
  \ unmoving and patient.\n\nSkating on the thin ceiling dome of a frigid lake is\
  \ riding bareback on a wild mustang. The horse tries to throw you from its back\
  \ with all its agile muscle, and you cling to it still, grasping its tangled hair\
  \ in your fists. Your shadow is trapped there below you underwater and you are above\
  \ it, hovering by some small millimeters. We skated back and I understood that putting\
  \ a collar on a wolf does not make it yours, that riding a wild horse does not mean\
  \ you want to tame it; but instead, that what we ached for was to dance with wildness."
