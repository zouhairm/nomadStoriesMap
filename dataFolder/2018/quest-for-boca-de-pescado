Text: "A diverse group of expat hikers set off on a quest for a 14,000-foot peak called\
  \ Boca de Pescado (fish\u2019s mouth), in the Cajas Mountains of Ecuador. After\
  \ several failed attempts on foot, we decided to drive as far as possible in trucks\
  \ and hike from there. We drove up a nearby mountain, passed through a gate into\
  \ a protected watershed area, left a note on the gate that we would be returning\
  \ and please not to lock the gate. A bit farther on we almost lost both trucks,\
  \ one to a mountain stream and the other to a muddy road with a cliff on one side.\
  \ But the muscle of ten passengers prevailed. We freed and then parked the trucks,\
  \ and then bushwhacked up a steep muddy hill covered in huge clumps of p\xE1ramo\
  \ grass to a beautiful oasis on a high ridge, only to realize that we were still\
  \ two hours\u2019 hard hiking from Boca de Pescado. We gave in to good judgment,\
  \ enjoyed a snack in the shade with a mama and baby horse that came to check us\
  \ out, and headed back down the mountain. \nOn the return, we discovered that the\
  \ gate had been locked with a chain and padlock, despite the fact that our note\
  \ was still attached. We were trapped inside the protected area with no apparent\
  \ way out. We nervously debated our options. We could have left the trucks there,\
  \ climbed around the gate, walked to the highway, and returned the next day for\
  \ the trucks. Or, someone suggested hitching a truck to the gate and breaking it\
  \ open. That seemed like the most practical, if drastic, solution. And then the\
  \ owner of one truck dug around in his toolbox and produced a rat-tail file. With\
  \ a bit of effort, a half hour later we had cut through one link in the chain. We\
  \ pried it apart with a crowbar and made our escape. \nWe soon encountered a passerby,\
  \ sitting beside the road, looking surprised to see us. Somewhat suspiciously, he\
  \ asked how we got through the gate. One hiker said \u201Cm\xE1gico.\u201D The man\
  \ laughed, as did we all. I still wonder why someone would deliberately lock us\
  \ in \u2013 and was he the one who had done it? We hadn\u2019t seen any other people\
  \ or vehicles. \nThe excitement was followed by fried trout lunches with cold, local\
  \ beers in the nearby town of Sayaus\xED. We tossed the fish heads to a begging\
  \ cat, and I thought, he had more luck than we with bocas de pescado this day."
