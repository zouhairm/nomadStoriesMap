Text: "Even having almost all my clothes on, I felt the chilled night upon this ancient\
  \ city smoothly finding its way through and into my bones. The wind made the wooden\
  \ doors and windows tremble, mumbling the terrific sounds that echoed through the\
  \ solitary streets heading somewhere I could not really distinguish. I only had\
  \ 30 more minutes to check-in. Wandering between curved dragon-like roofs, I finally\
  \ saw a black mass that slowly turned into a head to toe covered in fur police officer.\
  \ I approached my only hope, flattered my eyelashes, put on my best covered smile\
  \ and asked for directions. He looked at me sympathetically, noticing I was not\
  \ from there, and with a phantom of a smile told me he was not from there either.\
  \ I thanked him anyway and kept on walking. Invisible strangers tried to approach\
  \ me in the forms of sound waves coming from hidden trash cans. I ended up in front\
  \ of a wide road with a monument I would surely take a picture of in a less stressful\
  \ situation. And as I expected, it was deserted. Not a single soul to comfort my\
  \ freezing anxiety. I was terribly lost. I ordered myself to keep on moving. So\
  \ I wandered through the widest road and gazed upon a man walking alone. I rushed\
  \ towards him inverting the roles of intimidation. I don\u2019t know where that\
  \ road is, he said, but, eureka! he had a smartphone. God bless technology in the\
  \ land of the ignorants. He showed me a map where my destination was shown but with\
  \ no streets to it. I was really cold and tired. And, as if the feeling meant more\
  \ than a thousand words he just said, come on! I\u2019ll take you there. I was going\
  \ for a walk anyway so anywhere is fine. I was glad but my South American education\
  \ triggered the alert button. But I followed, and followed, and kept on following\
  \ for what seemed like an eternity. My head started recreating torture scenes with\
  \ the images I had from an imaginary Beijing. I was tied to a pole in an old abandoned\
  \ factory, with my face covered with tears and blood. Here it is! I shook my drama\
  \ off and thanked the torturer turned into angel with a pinch of apology that he\
  \ took as if it was for the use of his time. Don\u2019t worry, just walk straight\
  \ ahead and take the left turn. Good luck! His words carried an invisible light\
  \ that brightened all the way. The transparent frost started melting with the warmth\
  \ inside and unexpectedly I managed to arrive on time. Oh Einstein, it feels so\
  \ good that you were so right. Time IS relative."
