Text: "The tyres of our hired sedan fought to find friction with the sandy Samoan\
  \ road. We were en route to our next sight: The Alofaaga Blowholes. \n\nIt was the\
  \ last stop on what was meant to be a whole day drive around the island of Savai\u2019\
  i, but it was smaller than expected so we were well ahead of schedule. \n\nThe car\
  \ came to a stop at the sight of a man wrapped in a colourful lava-lava with a machete,\
  \ handful of coconuts and warm toothless smile. We weren\u2019t sure which of these\
  \ cues to pay more attention to. \n \nHe walked right past the passenger window\
  \ to the back door and hopped in. We were speechless, partly because of shock, but\
  \ also because we knew nothing but \u2018please\u2019 and \u2018thank you\u2019\
  \ in Samoan. \n\nHe broke the silence, \u201Cblowhole?\u201D  \n\n\u201COkay\u201D\
  \ we replied, a little shaky. \n\nHe wanted a lift to the blowhole. We could do\
  \ that.\n\nThe rest of the drive was spent trying to discern the intentions of our\
  \ new passenger, while keeping a close eye on his machete. He seemed happy to talk\
  \ despite our language barrier, and when he wasn\u2019t speaking, his face was wrinkled\
  \ in a smile which put us at ease.  \n\nUpon arrival, we were met with the power\
  \ of pacific swell crashing into the massive rock platform. Mist sprouted into the\
  \ air as water was forced through holes in the solid shore. Each wave punctuated\
  \ by a violent roar. It was impressive.\n\nOur new companion pointed to a painted\
  \ line that ran the length of the rock. We assumed its purpose was to keep people\
  \ from getting too close to the edge, even though it was getting washed over with\
  \ ocean water. He motioned for us to wait behind the line, grabbed his coconuts\
  \ and stepped over it towards the edge. \n\nWe looked at each other worried and\
  \ confused, and watched the man skip toward the ocean. He hurled a coconut into\
  \ the abyss and ran back toward safety.\n\nA monstrous wave came in, we heard a\
  \ pop and saw the coconut shoot into the air like a cannonball. It flew so high\
  \ that it disappeared. \n\nThe man awaited his audience\u2019s reaction which prompted\
  \ our round of applause. He repeated the show until his coconuts were gone. Drop,\
  \ pop, boom! \n\nWe watched with fear for his safety, but also in awe of his ingenuity.\
  \ When he came back and humbly presented his palm, we delightfully paid for the\
  \ spectacle.\n\nA meal of roadside chicken was shared until another car pulled up.\
  \ He grabbed his props and thanked us as he strode to his new, unsuspecting audience."
