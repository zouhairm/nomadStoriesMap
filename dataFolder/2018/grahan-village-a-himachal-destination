Text: "Grahan village is situated in kullu district of Himachal pradesh state of India.\
  \ Its a 8km trek from kasol to  Grahan village. \nIt was a calm,early august morning\
  \ and was a bit hard to know what day it was as every one of us had burried our\
  \ cell phones in our rucksacks and moreover no one bothered to find out.\nThe view\
  \ had me occupy the spot where i could sit on the edge of the sitting area throwing\
  \ my legs hung out, while facing the beautiful mountains.\nThe clouds over the beautiful\
  \ mountains of grahan village acted as over protective boyfriend, they came and\
  \ went away in certain intervals as if the way we were looking at the view would\
  \ ruin its beauty.\nThe dew drops over the maize field. Yes! no traffic, no honking,\
  \ no hrash daily life running and no offfices to be at.\nThe loud speaker played\
  \ James Blunt and Kygo tunes in a low volume which just gave life to every dead\
  \ cell in my body.it was a constant fight that weather i gaze the view with that\
  \ lovely background music or read my book. Doing both the lovely days passed in\
  \ no time.\n\nAs per the local residants the Grahan village was originally formed\
  \ of two kind of people.\nThe first kind were migrated from Malana village(kasol)\
  \ they were very few in number and after wandering for a long time they found a\
  \ plane piece of land in between mighty hills, the people who migrated from Malana\
  \ were saints and the malanese people believe that they are desendents of Alaxander\
  \ and their rituals involving purity and pollution are as stringent as their faith.\
  \ The people of malana impose fine on non-natives if they touched the walls and\
  \ their belongings, the entry to temples for non-native is prohobited and they dont\
  \ even eat food cooked by a non native.\n\nEntry in temples of Grahan village is\
  \ also prohibited for non-natives as they comprise of malanese people also.\nDuring\
  \ the time of malanese people settling in not yet formed grahan village, arrived\
  \ another group of people who followed Matamahai Temple. these people were in a\
  \ greater number than malanese people.\nA young man from malanese people had a child\
  \ with a girl from another group of people in grahan village, there was a great\
  \ conflict the unmarried couple was in exile for a long time and hence the days\
  \ passed and they all became a single community including the couple in exile. and\
  \ hence formed the beautiful Grahan village.\n\nNOTE: please bring back your trash\
  \ or dispose it at proper disposable place.Be a responsible traveler help in keeping\
  \ those trails evergreen."
