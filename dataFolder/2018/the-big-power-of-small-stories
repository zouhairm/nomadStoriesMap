Text: "I stepped into the public library. Some young guys in were already sat in the\
  \ movable plastic chairs in front of the little stage. Maria, an old lady with a\
  \ bright sparks in her eyes, approached me with her arms wide open. \n\"I am so\
  \ glad that you are here, she said.\" I smiled. \"We wait for some more people to\
  \ come, then we are ready to listen.\"\n\"Sure\", I said. My leg muscles were in\
  \ pain. \nI was left alone from the women, while the chairs were taken one by one.\
  \ Most of the audience was composed by young people; but here and there was possible\
  \ to see someone older.\nWher everything was ready, Maria call everyone's attention\
  \ and she spoke for some minutes as introduction. I was standing next to her. When\
  \ she finished, she passed me the microphone. I waited for a while, then I took\
  \ a sip from my glass of local wine and I started talking.\n\nFew hours before I\
  \ had no idea of small town in the middle of Tuscany, rather I had of Maria, and\
  \ for sure the local youth was not my concern at all. I was walking for hours with\
  \ my backpack on my shoulders on the Via Francigena, a medieval walking path going\
  \ from Canterbury, England to the Vatican City in Rome. I was deadly tired and my\
  \ knees was yelling at me to stop and give them a break. So i finally give than\
  \ the victory and I decided that my day trip was made. In the only bar at the corner\
  \ of the main square, where - as well as most european cities - the church stood\
  \ in front of the town hall, I asked for the \"pilgrim\" accomodation. They pointed\
  \ the end of the street I had just walked over. I took a coffee, chatting a little\
  \ bit with the old men at the bar playing cards. I was the ultimate attraction of\
  \ the umpteenth boring day of them. Maria was the owner of the accomodation. While\
  \ I was filling the papers we talked about travelling. She had a great travelling\
  \ experience, \"then I stopped when my husband died nine years ago\". I felt sorry.\
  \ \"This accomodation is a different way of travelling for me. I am not going anywhere,\
  \ but I listen to many stories of backpackers passing by.\", she said. I told her\
  \ about the efforts of the last days. The blurred reflection of the meaning of walking\
  \ that much by myself. But then I told her about the people I met; the beauty of\
  \ the landscapes. She said: \"only tourists think that travelling has no shadows.\
  \ We host a meeting of local youth members of the community, this evening. Why don't\
  \ you talk a bit about your experience of slow travel? Could be inspiring for some\
  \ of them.\""
