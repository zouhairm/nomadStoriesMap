Text: "Rural Ethiopia was almost exactly as I\u2019d imagined. Course plains heaved\
  \ in the wind and kudus grazed beneath a rocky skyline. In my fantasies, however,\
  \ I was never lying in the aisle of a bus, clutching a tin bucket as if it were\
  \ the ledge of a cliff.\n We were on our way from Addis Ababa to Harar, and I was\
  \ limp with what I presume was dengue fever. And self-diagnosed diseases are the\
  \ worst kind. Hot metal rattled beneath me. Chains of nausea tightened around my\
  \ chest. I heard someone say, \u201COoh, a zebra!\u201D in between my fainting spells.\
  \ \n For matters beyond the pale of the bucket, I had to ask the driver to stop\
  \ by ringing a small bell. In these cases, my friends vowed to look away, as the\
  \ spare brush didn\u2019t offer much by way of privacy.\n After countless such indignities,\
  \ we reached the Harari border, which was guarded by a small security kiosk, a traffic\
  \ barrier and two armed guards. Since there was no visible road and miles of wilderness\
  \ on either side, this border check seemed to operate on the honor system.\n Our\
  \ driver presented his I.D. and asked the guards in Amharic if they had a bathroom\
  \ I could use. They pointed their rifles into the distance, where I could loosely\
  \ discern the shape of an outhouse. Humbled with gratitude, I began the long, lonely\
  \ walk in its direction.\n The facilities were three sheets of corrugated tin and\
  \ a wood panel roof assembled around a hole in the ground. The flies were deafening.\
  \ But with solitude and a wall to lean against, I had found something like peace.\n\
  \ Midway through, a rustle startled me from behind and I turned my head to see a\
  \ baboon hoisting itself through a nearby tree. Ethiopian baboons are unique, with\
  \ red patches of skin in the middle of their chests like superhero emblems and garish\
  \ capes of feathery fur the color of coffee with cream. Their faces seem pulled\
  \ from taffy and left to dry in the sun. And when they snarl, the skin of their\
  \ snouts recede over their skulls, revealing an autopsy of spittle, teeth and gums.\
  \ \n I learned that last fact firsthand, when the charcoal knuckles of a second\
  \ baboon wrapped around the outhouse wall and drew a roaring face into the stall.\
  \ It crawled in, swift and spider-like, telegraphing pure, territorial rage. Its\
  \ hot breath was stronger than my fever. Summoning a speed I never matched before\
  \ or since, I burst out of the toilet, underpants still wrapped around my knees,\
  \ and ran screaming to the bus.\n I can only hope my companions were looking the\
  \ other way."
