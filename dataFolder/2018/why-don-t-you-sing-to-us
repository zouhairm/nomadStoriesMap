Text: "The winter sun glared from the sky. The woman, wearing a parka and a scarf\
  \ wrapped around her head, asked again: \u201CWhy don\u2019t you sing to us?\u201D\
  \nHer words echoed through my head, while the ladies dark eyes searched for meaning\
  \ in my light eyes.\n\nSighing deeply, I looked around, at the people laughing in\
  \ small groups, the grounds red dust contrasting with the green hills in the background.\n\
  We were Dutch students on a travel grant in Mpumalanga, South Africa. For weeks\
  \ we had gathered and prepared our trip, learning about HIV, collecting donations,\
  \ believing we would head somewhere to have an impact.\nTo us, the trip was all\
  \ fun and play. During the day we would walk to the after school care, where we\
  \ would cuddle the little ones while admiring the young adults who were performing\
  \ for entertainment. Day trips to all the main attractions were organized. Our camp\
  \ was set-up in the garden of an orphanage, where we would stargaze before bedtime,\
  \ noticing constellations unfamiliar to our eyes.\nSome say that stars make you\
  \ put things into perspective.\n\n\u201CWhy don\u2019t you sing to us?\u201D I saw\
  \ the disappointment flicker in the woman\u2019s eyes. The same disappointment I\
  \ had felt in myself. It seemed that even though we had prepared so well, we hadn\u2019\
  t prepared right.\nTake the first day. \u201CAisch!\u201D my exchange buddy exclaimed,\
  \ waving his hand like a fan as if he were hot, watching the girls in their shorts\
  \ and t-shirts. \u201CTo us\u201D he explained \u201Cthe sexiest part of a woman\
  \ is the back of her leg. And I see many of that now.\u201D\nOr the boy at the school\
  \ we visited to give a presentation on HIV prevention. \u201CWe saw lions at the\
  \ Kruger Park\u201D I told the boy excitingly. \u201CHave you been?\u201D He shook\
  \ his head, digging his bare toes into the ground. \n\n\u201CWhy don\u2019t you\
  \ sing to us?\u201D Often, we had heard that music is a large part of South African\
  \ culture. \u201CThey sing everywhere, at home, in the taxi, even at work. It\u2019\
  s being part of the community.\u201D At home, only pop stars sang, and everyone\
  \ else would be teased should their tune be shaky. No, it wasn\u2019t part of our\
  \ culture - but of theirs.\n\n\u201CWhy don\u2019t you sing to us?\u201D Timidly,\
  \ I started to hum a melody from my childhood. Slowly, I added the lyrics, using\
  \ gibberish words for the parts I couldn\u2019t remember. Memories flashed before\
  \ my eyes, of my mother singing me to sleep, of my grandmother holding my hand during\
  \ church choir practice, and of the sunny road trip with friends, shouting along\
  \ to the latest radio hit.\n\nThe woman\u2019s stern look changed. She smiled."
