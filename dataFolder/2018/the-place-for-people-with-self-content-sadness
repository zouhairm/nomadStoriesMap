Text: "I don\u2019t think there has been a country in recent history more filled with\
  \ wars and massacres than Bosnia & Herzegovina. \nThey never asked for it, it just\
  \ kind of happened\u2026 Like all of our problems in life right?\n\nWhen I arrived\
  \ in Sarajevo it was pitch dark. After grabbing a cab I went to the center of the\
  \ town, Bascarsija. \nThat cab ride automatically taught me something: Bosnian people\
  \ are not over the top nice. They are not happy nice or false nice\u2026 They are\
  \ just nice. \nAs the driver pulled over, I thought that it was a dark, gloomy and\
  \ somewhat trashy place. But my heart has always felt like that so I was instantly\
  \ at home. \nAfter a few days sightseeing and after meeting tons of people I was\
  \ in love. \nYou know when you meet that one person that is self-content? That realizes\
  \ that perhaps life does not serve a gran purpose but it\u2019s like \u201Ceh, let\u2019\
  s still enjoy it\u201D. \nSometimes it\u2019s just a misconception, but every now\
  \ and then it\u2019s the real thing. \nAnd that\u2019s Sarajevo and Bosnia & Herzegovina.\
  \ It\u2019s a place where people know their history, where the cities know their\
  \ history. They do not dwell on it, but they don\u2019t sugar coat a thing. Why\
  \ should they?\n\nNowadays it\u2019s hard to find a pure place and Bosnia it\u2019\
  s pure on its impureness.\nPeople are not afraid to talk about their hardship, but\
  \ they don't ask you to feel sorry for them. Our past has made us who we are and\
  \ the bullets in the apartment buildings in Sarajevo made the city what it is. \n\
  The death of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand made the city what it is. \nThe killing\
  \ of Jews during the WW2 made the city what it is. \n\u2003\nI realize that this\
  \ text feels like I\u2019m writing a love letter to Bosnia & Herzegovina and specially\
  \ the city of Sarajevo\u2026 And that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m trying to do.\
  \  \nThe world is filled with hate. With wars, with blood shed. Most people live\
  \ their life\u2019s struggling, hoping for the best and expecting the worst. \n\
  Bosnian people don\u2019t overthink things. They made a film festival during the\
  \ war against the Serbs and why not? We all like movies. \nIn Bosnia you wake up\
  \ and know that you\u2019re probably going to have a dull day. Perhaps you\u2019\
  ll have a crappy day, but you\u2019re likely to survive. And that\u2019s life. \n\
  You get through your days and survive, live to fight another battle. That\u2019\
  s the Bosnian spirit and that\u2019s all that matters in the end. \n\nOh and don\u2019\
  t get me wrong, Bosnia & Herzegovina might be sad beautiful on the inside, but it\u2019\
  s magical on the outside."
