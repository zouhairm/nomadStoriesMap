Text: 'Carabiners are intended to keep you safe and hold steadfast, which is precisely
  how I''d describe my friendship with Kerry. We keep eachother safe when we''re doing
  stupid, and sometimes dangerous things.


  We visited a bar in Amsterdam, where the locals are friendlier than any country
  I''ve ever been to. Dancing and singing, the bar was exactly what we liked and the
  local guys always take a shine to Kerry. One buys us a drink and moved to play on
  the slot machine.


  The next thing we know, he''s on the floor, covered in blood and the lights come
  on and everyone runs. We''re English, we''re not leaving our drinks. Both on hands
  and knees, we drag him into the recovery position as the staff look on surprised.


  The paramedics arrived and we''re ushered out of the bar, not before the staff give
  us tequila slammers.


  Onto a nightclub, where the bouncers give us free entry and complimentary cocktail.
  We abandon eachother to mingle, and an hour later I find my best friend, a good
  old Yorkshire lass, talking to a Dutch guy in Bengali.


  We arrived in the city at 11pm, and finally arrived at our hotel at 7am the next
  day. Saved a life, had a tonne of free shots, met people from around the world and
  woke up with the worst hangover imaginable.


  We still saw everything Amsterdam has to offer, the highest swing in Europe (not
  the only high thing in Amsterdam), stroopwaffles, fairs, flowers, canals, and of
  course the Heineken Museum!


  It was 36 hours in one of the most beautiful, peaceful, party orientated city. It''s
  the definition of an oxymoron.'
