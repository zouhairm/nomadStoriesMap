Text: After so many years without him in my life. He come back, my father come back.
  For so many year's my heart was broken, i was having lot of questions. Why did he
  left me? Why he was not visiting me? Does he love me?. Yes my mother was there for
  me providing me with everything, giving me love and care. But there was that space
  left that was supposed to filled by my father ' the father's love. I needed it but
  i didn't got it. When i was 16 year's old he come back. The last thing i was expecting
  from him didn't happened i thought i was going to have his love. The pain i was
  having was gone. I was ready to welcome him in my life, i was ready to forgive him
  when i saw i didn't know it was my last day seeing him. After the day i saw him
  he died he left me for good for ever. I cryed out loud i cryed for him a lot. I
  have let it go well everything happened for a reason. Father where ever you are
  i have forgive you. I love you and i will always do forever. Maybe you can see me
  how grown i have become and i know you are proud of me. Iam sure you wish me all
  the best in life. The last thing i expected from you was love, i didn't get it but
  i know and i can feel it inside me that you do love me.
