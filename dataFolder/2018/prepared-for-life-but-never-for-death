Text: "There were so many tragedies in the fall of 2013. In the U.S., government officials\
  \ sought approval for military action against Syria; in Baluchistan, an earthquake\
  \ with a magnitude of 7.7 claimed the lives of over 300 Pakistanis, and in Mexico,\
  \ Hurricane Ingrid and Manuel destroyed thousands of homes along the Gulf of Mexico.\
  \ \n\nIt was logical to tell myself that the death of a stranger\u2019s dog was\
  \ insignificant against the backdrop of tragedies occurring around the globe.\n\
  Yet the reality was that this heartbroken stranger, kneeling in the middle of a\
  \ dark, rainy road somewhere on the South Island of New Zealand, mourning and cradling\
  \ the limp body of Deja, his brown, curly-haired Labrador that had been prancing\
  \ around just seconds before, was a tragedy with its own depths that only we could\
  \ comprehend.\n\nUp until that night, every moment of my journey had been carefully\
  \ constellated. My first few weekends in New Zealand were conglomerates of mini-escapades,\
  \ and my weekdays were spent meticulously planning them. I had explored every town,\
  \ walked every street, driven miles on the North Island\u2019s muddy and relentlessly\
  \ rainy roads, raging against the dying of the light, as students on exchange often\
  \ do. My eyes had devoured the snowy peaks of Queenstown, and my ears were soothed\
  \ by the magical silence of Doubtful Sound; my lungs were filled with the piercing\
  \ cold air of the abandoned beaches, and I\u2019d slept under the brilliant Milky\
  \ Way in Dunedin. That\u2019s the way I had planned it. \n\nNow here I was on the\
  \ darkest road of South Island\u2019s Fox Glacier, just 180 meters from my hostel,\
  \ and ten meters from the Minnehaha trail where the man and Deja would have led\
  \ me and a group of nine others through one of New Zealand\u2019s top glowworm encounters.\
  \ \n\nThe man had walked this familiar path with Deja countless times in the two\
  \ years since he had rescued her from a puppy mill, and tonight we had hoped to\
  \ do the same. \n\nBut our plans took a sharp turn, and in the instant that a jeep\
  \ swerved on the slick road striking Deja to her death, the path embodied only the\
  \ miscalculated seconds for which we could not have prepared ourselves. \n\nThat\
  \ night I experienced a profound shift within myself. \n\nI realized that although\
  \ the objective of traveling is often to experience life, very rarely do we prepare\
  \ ourselves to experience death. Yet the very existence of death can make the impermanent\
  \ moments that we experience that much more impactful, and perhaps, in their own\
  \ way, everlasting."
