Text: "\u201CClose your eyes and jump!\u201D I whispered to myself as I hit the \u2018\
  Book Now\u2019 button on a 10-day solo trip to Bali. Being fresh out of a long-term\
  \ relationship forces a dependence on yourself, a learning of how to be your own\
  \ best friend. I wanted my own adventure, after all that\u2019s why I'd chosen to\
  \ become single. But I was terrified. New territory, new terrain, somewhere as far\
  \ away as possible where all I recognised was the skin on the back of my hands.\
  \ A self-proposed challenge which I faced fuelled with anxiety and anticipation.\
  \ I had to do this to grow. Bali embraced me. New sights, sounds and smells surrounded\
  \ me so densely that I didn\u2019t have a chance to feel alone. Engulfed by new\
  \ experiences, my eagerness to explore replaced the doubts which had dominated.\
  \ My senses were preoccupied with pleasure. I based myself in Ubud, a haven of Hindu\
  \ traditions. Rice fields, temples and streets strewn with the prettiest Canang\
  \ Sari; twice daily floral offerings to the gods, thanking them for peace. Such\
  \ a calm pace of life I couldn't contemplate back home, their dedicated devotion\
  \ defied my usually busy life. Walking the poorly maintained pavements avoiding\
  \ holes and uneven surfaces I stepped carefully over the sweet scattered offerings,\
  \ so many it reminded me of confetti remnants from party poppers. Markets and mopeds\
  \ injected a rush of activity. Scooters swarmed like mosquitoes, Mothers straddled\
  \ bikes - no helmets - with children held on laps, trusting their way of life. Markets\
  \ had a splendid stench in the heat. Leather, spice and sweat coupled with constant\
  \ calls to buy, stimulated my senses to the point where I couldn\u2019t stop smiling.\
  \ I visited a Hindu healer, with no idea what it would hold. After him repeatedly\
  \ banging hard on my head and pushing his thumbs so forcefully into my closed eyes\
  \ that I wondered if it was a joke, he told me, that I had to become my own hero.\
  \ As I spent my last evening watching the sunset at Tanah Lot, I took it all in,\
  \ every single bit of it. I\u2019d had monkeys on my head, eaten fruits I\u2019\
  d never heard of, shared a bedroom with lizards, and lingered with locals. I had\
  \ navigated my own adventure. Faraway from anyone I knew, I felt an intrepid confidence\
  \ blooming, happy and safe in my own skin. Teaming tour groups around me, selfie\
  \ sticks obstructing the view, and with a somewhat hands-on tour guide trying to\
  \ sit with his arms around me, I realised just how far I\u2019d come. I wondered,\
  \ if maybe, I already was my own hero."
