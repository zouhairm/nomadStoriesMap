Text: "August 30, 2017\nI went pig hunting today. \nI planned on waking early, checking-in\
  \ on the sunrise, and hiking to the Waihaha hut. But when I woke, the fog was in\
  \ and the rain felt close. I hadn\u2019t slept outside of town for a week or two,\
  \ and to feel the quiet, all I could think was falling back asleep. \nAround 730,\
  \ someone pulled into the carpark. \nI asked him about the idea of hiking back to\
  \ the hut. He said it\u2019s doable but a long way, and it\u2019d be easier to drive\
  \ down the road 10 minutes and pick up the trail from the DOC site. I asked him\
  \ about the track and if it was worth hiking to the Waihora Trig. He said, if I\
  \ was gonna do that, I may as well go hunting with him and his dogs. \nAran said\
  \ meet him on the trail because his dogs were ready to go and I needed time to get\
  \ ready. When I got to them, they were a few kilometers in. We hiked for hours.\
  \ Listening to the dogs, tracking them on GPS. \nAfter a few hours, one of the dogs\
  \ bailed. The shock against the silence stilled breath. Aran put his finger to his\
  \ lips.\nThe other dogs added a chorus, the pig\u2019s squeal muffled their bark.\
  \ We scrambled to the noise. \nIt was a moment when all is forgotten. We scampered\
  \ down the hill-face, scratched through the undergrowth, and just as we got near,\
  \ I got caught in a thorn bush. I untangled myself and came out in time to see Aran\
  \ approaching the dogs. They were circled around the pig hiding beneath a silver\
  \ fern. \nThinking back, the sound of the poor brute was wrenching, but in the moment\
  \ it was muffled, a part of a larger symphony. I pulled back the fern, as Aran approached\
  \ its back. He stuck his knife into its throat, forcing it towards its heart. The\
  \ sound of death was somehow so cinematic, like a war movie when the hero\u2019\
  s buddy dies in his lap. \nBeing a part of the act was chilling, but there was something\
  \ normal in it all. Part of it was my unwillingness to show weakness in the face\
  \ of such a primordial man task. \nI\u2019ve only ever gotten meat from a grocery\
  \ store. I\u2019ve rarely seen where it comes from and have never been directly\
  \ involved in the process. I felt pain for the animal, but there was also a sense\
  \ of it being part of the circle of things. Where somehow that pig on this day,\
  \ lost. \nTo have walked so far, and been so engaged in the hunt, and to hear the\
  \ dogs bail and the pig cry and to run and climb and crawl and fight just to get\
  \ to the thing and to feel its heat while a knife ended its life was some inner\
  \ caveman shit."
