Text: "We all have those days where we can't quite believe what happened; from good,\
  \ bad to plain bizarre. One instance of this came as my Vietnamese visa was expiring\
  \ and, with a limited amount of time and options I was looking frantically for something\
  \ haphazard and thrilling. \nIn travelling solo, I was able to embrace these factors\
  \ more freely than most and so I set the Philippines as my next stop. The intent\
  \ was to see a few volcanoes and obtain my PADI where it would be the islands on\
  \ which I'd find what I was looking for, but no, it was the city of Manila in which\
  \ one of the most surprising 24 hours of my travels took place.\n\nHeading to my\
  \ hostel from the airport in the early hours I had no cause to worry; I felt that\
  \ I was a seasoned enough traveller at this point, that was until my driver refused\
  \ to take me any further before dumping me out on a crossroad, the corners of which\
  \ were dominated by gangs who were more than a little intimidating at 4 AM. Never\
  \ before had I dived so quickly into a 7Eleven where I managed to wrangle myself\
  \ a tricycle via the clerks and get safely to my hostel. A stark contrast to the\
  \ streets though, I was greeted warmly, reassured and my fears of the \"gangland\"\
  \ I'd entered were quickly laid to rest. \n\nThe morning after they encouraged me\
  \ and the other guests to go on a street tour. Sure, dive right in, mingle with\
  \ new faces and get a feel for the city, business as usual on day one. Well, not\
  \ exactly. Not when the tour itself was run by a former street kid who, having been\
  \ adopted by Americans, was now paying forward his good fortune to those who needed\
  \ it most. It turned out that our tour was less about ticking off the landmarks\
  \ and more about showing us the reality of Manila's less fortunate people; not in\
  \ a way the guilted us into giving or to question our morals - it was simply, honest.\
  \ We gave what we could, but never have I experienced conditions like that in my\
  \ life; I still can't quite process what I saw there.\n\nWe returned to the hostel\
  \ to figure our dinner plans, and it turned out the Sikh temple offered free food\
  \ (a backpackers dream) which we embraced, along with the unexpected cultural exchange\
  \ that went with it. Then some after dinner entertainment? Enter a rooftop performance\
  \ of Broadway showtunes performed as part of a protest for gay rights whilst using\
  \ the Catholic Cathedral as their backdrop, because whilst banned from the actual\
  \ church, the rooftop next door was fair game. Genius. \n\nUnexpected. Unforgettable."
