Text: "Freyja and I prepared some tea and took it to the sofa, where Sigurgeir and\
  \ Maia were deep in conversation. I sat by them and picked up Freyja's guitar. Sigurgeir\
  \ thoroughly enjoyed the tunes eminating from the instrument, despite the clear\
  \ lack of talent which forced me to abandon certain songs halfway through. But he\
  \ didn't mind. He turned toward me, staring blankly ahead, and begged, yet again,\
  \ for the song about the blue eyes. I smiled, played and sang the familiar Australian\
  \ song.\nSigurgeir had never known what we looked like. Several months before, his\
  \ eyesight had diminished, suddenly and drastically. No-one knew why, or if it would\
  \ ever return. By the moment we met, he only had twenty percent of his original\
  \ eyesight remaining, and could only perceive people's outlines, but not their faces.\
  \ Although his voice reflected certain optimism, one could feel the underlying sense\
  \ of desperation.\nSo Maia and I spent our time scouring for different forms of\
  \ entertainment so as to make him forget his misery. I taught him some origami,\
  \ placing my hands over his to fold the paper. Maia, born with a love and great\
  \ talent for singing, filled the air with her soft, full voice.\nAll this made me\
  \ think of my own mother, also suffering from a complicated medical condition as\
  \ a result of which she was bedridden for over a decade, and no-one could find a\
  \ cure. At least she had one of the best hospitals nearby. In Iceland, a small island\
  \ with a population of less than 350,000 people, experts in particular medical disciplines\
  \ are difficult to come by. Freyja and Sigurgeir were saving up for him to travel\
  \ to a certain hospital in California where related experimental medicine is practiced.\n\
  One day, in the backyard of Freyja's dollhouse-like cottage, we found a skipping\
  \ rope. We could hardly believe our eyes when Sigurgeir picked it up and started\
  \ skipping. Time seemed to stop. The fresh breeze drifting towards us from the immense\
  \ Atlantic ocean, behind an expanse of charcoal sand framed with majestic dark cliffs\
  \ topped with moss. Puffins, amongst other seabirds, flying to and fro across the\
  \ eternal dusk of an Icelandic summer. There are few places in the world where one\
  \ is privileged enough to see so much pure, unpolluted sky. Behind us loomed the\
  \ immense M\xFDrdalsj\xF6kull glacier. \nI wondered if Sigurgeir would ever be able\
  \ to enjoy the overwhelming beauty of his home again. But Freyja was determined,\
  \ and would never give up on him.\nAfter all, there is always hope."
