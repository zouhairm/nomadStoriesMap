Text: "New Year's Eve actually is a thing I deeply disliked. Weeks ahead I start worrying\
  \ about where and with whom to celebrate,  without ever sticking to one possibility:\
  \ Better stay flexible, in case anything better is still to come up. I didn't expect\
  \ it to be very different on the other side of the world - not even in one of the\
  \ most peaceful places I ever saw. I was couchsurfing in the north of Chile, in\
  \ a magical place called Valle del Elqui. Known as a spiritual stronghold it offered\
  \ a lot of soothing Reiki therapies, massages, meditation classes and other physical\
  \ and  spiritual healing treatments.\nMy couchsurfing hosts, three musicians from\
  \ Argentina, invited me to stay a couple of days in their cozy home - a huge former\
  \ school bus they had transformed into a place to live in. They were travelling\
  \ for over a year already and I was mesmerized by the vagabond lifestyle they lived.\
  \ I totally dived into it: I learned how to knot macram\xE9-bracelets,I  played\
  \ guitar on the streets and painted housewalls in exchange for food or a hot shower.\
  \ \nToday was my last full day in the valley and I was thankful for the surprisingly\
  \ unexcited atmosphere surrounding me. There were just a couple of hours left before\
  \ we would welcome the new year. We had spent the whole afternoon to prepare the\
  \ \"Submarino\", how they tenderly called their yellow bus, for a little excursion.\
  \  After a lot of discussion we had decided to spent New Year's Eve by a river called\
  \ \"el R\xEDo M\xE1gico\", we had heard about a magical hidden spot down there.\
  \ An abandoned camping only few people knew about.\nAs we finally had the bus ready\
  \ to go, we sent up a quick prayer that the motor wouldn't leave us in the lurch\
  \ - the sun was strong and this old boy not very much in love with the heat. But\
  \ he did his job.\nThe street was blurry and I could feel the sweat running down\
  \ my spine. I craved for a cooling. 45 minutes later I was rewarded with a jump\
  \ into the wet. The cold water ran over my face, my hair, my skin - it was an awakening\
  \ to my cells and renewed all my energies. When I got out the river, the others\
  \ already had gathered around a campfire, starting to slice vegetables for dinner.\
  \ The sun set quickly, and after we filled our stomaches with veggies and rice we\
  \ started \"la fiesta\": Guitar music and drums were filling the air, barely dressed\
  \ people with painted faces dancing around the fire or sitting together in groups\
  \ for chatting. When we started counting down to zero, I closed my eyes and breathed."
