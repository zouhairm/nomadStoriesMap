Text: "It's difficult to cherry-pick one story, not only I'm very fortunate to have\
  \ hundreds of different travel stories to tell, but they're usually made-up from\
  \ ordinary events: smells, a coffee, a view, meet someone, strolling in unknown\
  \ markets, sleeping in the desert. All of those are brushstrokes in a big painting,\
  \ hard to individualise. Some are not story worthy: normally me walking through\
  \ a city without any specific destination, having a coffee or admiring a view. Others\
  \ are too short or uninteresting: my (almost) arrest in Iran for wearing shorts\
  \ or having one of my trips being transformed in a Finish comic book. Starting to\
  \ write this story was like opening a Pandora's box with thousands of memories from\
  \ the Americas, Europe, Africa and Asia emerging. But since I've to select one,\
  \ here it goes: September 2007, I was in my 20s travelling throughout Indochina,\
  \ wandering alone through the streets of Luang Prabang, Laos, already bored, I admit,\
  \ from all the temples and Buddha statues. It was a typical cloudy day in the rainy\
  \ season and I started to make my way up to a small and not particularly impressive\
  \ temple at the top of a nearby hill. When I arrive at the temple it was surprisingly\
  \ marvellous: the clouds disappeared, one of the most beautiful sunsets ever surfaced\
  \ and as far as the eye can see, only mountains and trees. I sat by the temple's\
  \ outer wall. The impressive view and sunset, provided me a rare and unique moment.\
  \ While I was lost in my thoughts (or lack of them) a young monk in an orange habit,\
  \ similar to the dozens I've encountered so far, approached and asked me if we could\
  \ speak for a minute, a bit annoyed I agreed. For the next half an hour I had one\
  \ of the most interesting conversations of my life, the young monk asked me about\
  \ my country, Europe and, more broadly, the outside world; but not in a way that\
  \ I was expecting\u2026 he asked me about international politics, religion, science,\
  \ literature and history. It was an impressive, if short, conversation. That monk,\
  \ not more than 22 years old, had never left Laos, he knew nothing other than his\
  \ small temple and home village. His vivid intelligence (far superior to my own),\
  \ willingness to learn, curiosity about the world, impressive culture and knowledge\
  \ (he correctly cited at least Thoreau and Pessoa) made a lasting impression on\
  \ me. His name was  Akamu and I never saw him again. Hopefully he already met someone\
  \ more qualified than I to assist him in his quest."
