Text: "Thoosie handed me a bush baby. \n\u201CKeep this nice and close.\u201D I hugged\
  \ the hot-water-bottle to my chest feeling the warmth straight through my jacket.\
  \ The Botswanan Okavango Delta was fresh that morning.  \n\u201CCome.\u201D My fellow\
  \ travellers and I followed. Thoosie took us to the truck, but she didn\u2019t get\
  \ on. \n\u201CYou\u2019re not coming?\u201D I asked. \n\u201CI must stay and make\
  \ lunch.\u201D\nShe waved as we drove away.  \n\nWhen we returned she helped us\
  \ off the truck. \n\u201CSpot anything?\u201D \n\u201CGiraffe, zebra, antelope,\
  \ warthogs, leopards and hyenas,\u201D I said, \u201Cbut I hope we find lions \u2013\
  \ they\u2019re my favorite.\u201D \nThoosie nodded. \u201CI hope you will.\u201D\
  \ But we found no lions that day. \n\nThoosie handed me my bush baby. \nShe attempted\
  \ to walk us to the truck, but stopped. \"Elephants!\" The ground shuddered as a\
  \ heard of elephants stomped through our African camp. We hid in the trees and watched\
  \ the magnificent beasts. Thoosie waited long after they were gone before leading\
  \ us to the truck. \n\n\"Still no lions,\" I said as Thoosie helped us off the truck,\
  \ \"but we found a hippo.\"\nThoosie smiled. \"This afternoon you're going fishing.\"\
  \ \n\nThoosie walked us down the small jetty and helped us into the long motorised\
  \ canoe. \n\u201CCatch some fish for dinner,\u201D she called. \n We caught bass\
  \ and bream and even a river-bred tigerfish, but our guides told us to throw them\
  \ all back. I realised Thoosie was joking about the fish \u2014  she still had to\
  \ make us dinner. We ate venison that evening. \n\u201CDo you have children?\u201D\
  \ a companion asked when she brought out desert. \nShe confirmed that she did. Thoosie\
  \ would see them in \u2018just\u2019 one week, for her regular monthly visit.  She\
  \ would relieve their grandmother from parenting for a few days and then return\
  \ to the forest camp to continue work. \nWhen do you get a break? I wondered. \n\
  \u201CIt\u2019s horrible,\u201D she said, \u201CI get terrible plane sickness, but\
  \ the only way to see them is by taking a small aircraft.\u201D\n\u201CDo you miss\
  \ them?\u201D someone asked. \n\u201CI miss them very much.\u201D\n\nThoosie handed\
  \ me my bush baby. \n\u201CMaybe lions today,\u201D she said. \nWe drove for hours\
  \ across the African plains, but saw nothing. Eventually we received a tip-off from\
  \ another group \u2013 a lion kill was not far from us. We moved quickly mistaking\
  \ logs and antelope for lions. \nWe found the male chewing on a bloody zebra carcass.\
  \ There was blood splatter on his paws, teeth and mane. His pride lay lazily near\
  \ him in the sun.\n\nThoosie helped us off the truck. \n\u201CLions,\u201D I said."
