Text: "Mumbai is the embodiment of economic disparity. Skyscrapers soar into the sky\
  \ while makeshift tin roofs give millions shelter. Luxury hotels remain booked at\
  \ capacity, frequented by wealthy tourists and socialites for their opulent celebrations\
  \ while thousands of residents lack access to basic sanitation and water. However,\
  \ this disparity has rarely been the cause for tension in Mumbai\u2019s eventful\
  \ history. In fact, a fascinating harmony has always united people from both sides\
  \ of the economic spectrum. Below, I am going to write on how animal welfare is\
  \ unexpectedly creating a synergy between the rich and the poor in Mumbai.\nAround\
  \ 100,000 stray dogs fondly known as \u2018indies\u2019 roam the streets of Mumbai.\
  \ Homeless, adaptive and more importantly, friendly, thousands of people take up\
  \ the task of feeding them everyday while a select few welcome them into their homes\
  \ by adopting them. I took up a videography assignment with an organisation that\
  \ provides free treatment to injured stray animals to document the strays and the\
  \ people whose empathy and compassion ensures the survival of these beautiful beings.\
  \ However, what I experienced through the course of the assignment was the last\
  \ thing I expected. I met a roadside vegetable vendor who feeds and takes care of\
  \ over forty indies like they were her own. All this while living in a home barely\
  \ held together by two tin sheets without access to cooking gas and clean water.\
  \ I visited a number of \u2018chawls\u2019, typical housing arrangements for labourers\
  \ and unskilled workers where the poor health of indies under their care often gave\
  \ them sleepless nights. I documented inspiring initiatives in housing societies\
  \ where people raised hundreds of dollars to treat indies with cancers, tetanus\
  \ and other life threatening diseases. I met a couple residing in a stunning sea\
  \ facing bungalow in prime Mumbai real estate who opened their homes to an indie\
  \ that was run over by a vehicle and left to die on the streets. \nWhen we brought\
  \ together animal lovers from all socioeconomic backgrounds, their interactions\
  \ were fascinating. Despite a striking contrast and disparity in the lives of those\
  \ who cared for these animals, the special bond they had with them made those less\
  \ fortunate forget about their struggles and those in a position of privilege perceive\
  \ their problems as immaterial. Stories exchanged from different worlds were a great\
  \ catharsis and gave participants a different perspective. For me, it was simply\
  \ the last thing I expected."
