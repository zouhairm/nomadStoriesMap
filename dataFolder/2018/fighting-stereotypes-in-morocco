Text: "I\u2019m leaving for Morocco and my mother is crying. It seems that I can't\
  \ convince her that I will come back home safe and sound, that no one is going to\
  \ kidnap me, that I won\u2019t be a victim of terrorism. I can\u2019t blame her,\
  \ she\u2019s always been like this: rural southern Italy seems to be a prolific\
  \ place for prejudices to grow. And that\u2019s the reason why I decided to embark\
  \ on a ten-day trip, all alone, in westerners-hostile (according to my mum\u2019\
  s view) Morocco: to start a personal crusade against the stereotypes she has been\
  \ trying to instill in my mind.\nOnce landed in Marrakech, excited by the new environment,\
  \ I stop the first cab I see and I rush to my hotel. For the first time in my life,\
  \ looking out the window, I can\u2019t find words to describe what I\u2019m seeing.\
  \ I\u2019m suddenly reminded of my university teacher explaining that, finding themselves\
  \ unable to describe a land so different in the day of its discovery, American chroniclers\
  \ would compare indigenous villages to their most similar-looking European cities,\
  \ in order to give Spanish readers a better understanding of the new territory.\
  \ But I don\u2019t want to smooth differences over, so I\u2019m going to deny myself\
  \ comparisons. \nAt my hotel, I wear my alone-female-tourist-in-an-arabic-country\
  \ outfit, and I go out hoping to find someplace to eat nearby. It turns out that\
  \ the city map I bought is completely useless: jemaa el fna, Marrakech\u2019s main\
  \ square, is kind of hard to miss. I\u2019m simply amazed: step by step I can hear\
  \ noise growing, and a massive column of smoke is winding above my head...I just\
  \ need to walk towards them. Entering the square is a sensuous shock that I\u2019\
  ve never experienced in my whole life: it is love at first sight, smell and hearing.\
  \ It takes some time for my eyes to adjust to the darkness of the place (the lighting\
  \ is clearly inadequate to light up a space so vast), my smell is seized with the\
  \ pungent scent of cooked beef and local spices, and the myriad of local performers,\
  \ musicians and peddlers make a sound so perpetual and iterative that is almost\
  \ hypnotic. Walking around snakes charmers, fire-breathers, ancient instruments\
  \ and mystical melodies, me, aged 21, I finally get to understand what \u201Cdifferent\u201D\
  \ means. \nIt\u2019s night and my unstoppable stream of consciousness won\u2019\
  t let me sleep. Is there a Moroccan mother who\u2019s warning her daughter about\
  \ westerners right now? What would she tell her about us? Are we really this different?\
  \ I want answers to my questions, that\u2019s the reason why I\u2019m here."
