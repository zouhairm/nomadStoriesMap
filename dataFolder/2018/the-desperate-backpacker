Text: "Picture This:\n\nYou\u2019re a twenty-something graduate, low on funds, no\
  \ desire to embrace the real working world so you decide to escape to a faraway\
  \ land. You find yourself on the most exclusive balcony in Sydney, Australia overlooking\
  \ the magically majestic masterpiece that is the Sydney Opera House.\n \nBasking\
  \ in the warmth of the natural morning sunlight you calmly observe the Australian\
  \ birdlife as they energetically weave, dive and dance around the grand structure\
  \ of the Harbour Bridge. Deeply breathing in your nostrils are greeted by the salty\
  \ breeze from the Pacific Ocean.\n \nYour silent haven is suddenly interrupted by\
  \ the sound of cursing projected towards your vicinity. The source, a stereotypical\
  \ Aussie bloke named \u201COllie\u201D, who until last week was in prison for shooting\
  \ his drug dealer. Behind him is \u201CNiko\u201D, a 6.4 foot Maori giant with the\
  \ combined strength of three men. Recently released for crushing a man\u2019s skull\
  \ with his bare hands. The victim, a cat burglar who clearly ran out of his nine\
  \ lives when Niko turned vigilante.\n\nThis is the true story of how I came to Sydney\
  \ with nothing but a rucksack and a few dollars to my name. My aim to explore, have\
  \ the experience of a lifetime and find a job. The last thing I expected was to\
  \ be working side by side with murderers, drug dealers and people my mother always\
  \ warned me of.\n\nThis escapade took me to amazing places all over Sydney, by the\
  \ end I felt I had conquered the entire metropolis. I also found myself in picturesque\
  \ locations throughout New South Wales. Often admiring the beautiful landscapes\
  \ NSW had to offer; the rugged region to the west where the alluring Blue Mountains\
  \ stood; or a hidden beach cove in the north where the golden sands invitingly gleam\
  \ in the sun\u2019s bright rays.\n\nDuring my time as an adventurous backpacker,\
  \ I didn't commit a single crime. \n\nInstead I would rise at the crack of dawn\
  \ with the daunting task of moving extremely heavy furniture. The curses heard by\
  \ Ollie earlier were that of desperation as he struggled to carry a vintage piano\
  \ into a recently refurbished Sydney apartment.\n\nThe majority of furniture removers\
  \ in Australia often have a criminal background, as no one else wishes to endure\
  \ such physical hardship on a daily basis, unlike me, the desperate travelling backpacker.\
  \   \nThere was never a dull moment through the blood, sweat and tears I sacrificed\
  \ and as I stand on this multi-million dollar balcony I can happily say it's one\
  \ of the best decisions I\u2019ve ever made."
