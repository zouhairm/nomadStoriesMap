Text: "I slightly opened my eyes when the first rays of the rising sun touched them\
  \ gently while my head had leaned against the glass. The bus led us through an ancient\
  \ centuries old China which was neither untouched by any global industry nor tourism\
  \ and offered a fascinating sight of old Chinese villages lined up in between green\
  \ hills and graceful white cranes which were dancing and flapping their wings in\
  \ the golden rice fields. \nThe bus was on its way to the still well-preserved and\
  \ historical village Shangjing, which lays at the foot of the Jiufeng mountains,\
  \ also called the '9 peak mountains' by the locals. \n\nMy Chinese guest mother\
  \ and sister I shared their home with, treated me like an own family member from\
  \ the very beginning. Even though I did not speak any common languages with my mother\
  \ our gestures and smiles connected us immediately. I had to put down my western\
  \ name and took my new Chinese name 'Liu Shan' during this time instead, which sounded\
  \ like 'le ocean' in my ears whenever I have been called like this. \n\nAt this\
  \ place, however, the ocean has been miles away and the mountains, which always\
  \ reminded me of James Cameron's \"Avatar\", rose up against the blue horizon and\
  \ possessed the same attracting beauty. Endless green tea plantations, blue lakes\
  \ and diligent field workers with sun shades walking in front of the majestic 'Jiufeng'\
  \ really rounded up the painting-like scene. \n\nThe village project I have worked\
  \ on included a Responsible Tourism plan with an international team as well as local\
  \ English-speaking translator students from several Chinese universities. The villagers\
  \ essential desire were to preserve the natural habitat and historical buildings\
  \ by preventing the rural exodus by implementing an improved touristic infrastructure.\
  \ After weeks of work-filled days and sleepless nights we initiated together with\
  \ the mayor of Shangjing the first eco-tourism strategy plan for the area to support\
  \ the locals wishes. \n\nRight before the bus picked us up to bring us to the airport,\
  \ it was time to say goodbye to my Chinese family and all the locals and students\
  \ with whom I built up a deep friendship beyond borders with.\n\nMonths past. Back\
  \ in my home country and the modern daily life routine calling I checked my E-Mails\
  \ - and smiled. It has been surprisingly announced a second eco-tourism project\
  \ round in Shangjing in late 2018. The heart of China is calling me - once again."
