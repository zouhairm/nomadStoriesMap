Text: "The sun was beating down on my face as I looked out at the seemingly endless\
  \ stretch of sea. I had been backpacking Europe for less than two months, nearly\
  \ all of which had been achieved by couch surfing. I was staying at a hostel, mingling\
  \ with fellow travelers and partaking in the popular pub crawls of M\xE1laga. After\
  \ all, this was my midlife crisis; I needed to treat myself to some careless fun.\
  \ But the novelty of repeatedly hearing Pitbull\u2019s El Taxi and having Spanish\
  \ men attempt to swoon me within moments of meeting wore off quick, and I found\
  \ myself yearning to be around people who knew the area and could teach me more\
  \ about the culture. So I did what a lot of young travelers do; I turned to trusty\
  \ Tinder.\nI was leaving town the next day so I needed to find someone with a sense\
  \ of adventure and free schedule. Meet Ruben: a local guy with beautiful soft green\
  \ eyes, long lashes and flowy hair, who didn\u2019t speak a lick of English. This\
  \ was perfect! I had taken a Spanish class nearly a decade before so all I could\
  \ recall was \u201Chola\u201D and \u201C\xBFd\xF3nde est\xE1 el ba\xF1o?\u201D You\
  \ know, the essentials. I was thrilled for this rendezvous.\nRuben agreed to meet\
  \ me at Parque de M\xE1laga within the hour. He rode up on his Osprey longboard,\
  \ which I took as a good sign as I was carrying my Osprey backpack. His warm smile\
  \ had me feeling instantly connected. We grabbed ice cream, pointing at the flavors\
  \ and exchanging English and Spanish pronunciations. We then hunted for some shade\
  \ and crawled away from the blistering Spanish sun.\nThe next three hours worked\
  \ like a game of charades, using Google translate when needed, which failed more\
  \ often than not. Confused glances were often exchanged, as well as laughs at the\
  \ sheer absurdity of what we were doing. We practiced simple phrases and words,\
  \ all while learning about each other's history and hopes for the future.\nWhen\
  \ the evening was coming to a close, my phone randomly froze. I had no choice but\
  \ to restart it, yet, the sales rep at the phone store had neglected to inform me\
  \ that I needed to punch in a pin for the SIM card with each startup. That pin was\
  \ on the sheet back at my hostel, which I now had no idea how to get to. With my\
  \ phone locked shut, I asked Ruben to help. He punched a phrase into Google, looked\
  \ up at me with eager eyes and exclaimed \u201CI carry you to hostel!\u201D I burst\
  \ out laughing, cradled my arms and said \u201CCarry? Okay!\u201D Needless to say,\
  \ Ruben safely walked me back, but I saved him the energy by using my own two feet."
