Text: "When the slow boat stopped in a small town called Pakbeng at dusk, I was itching\
  \ for the adventure of finding a place to stay on the fly.  Plus it was hot as balls\
  \ on that boat and every inch of my body was covered in sweat.  \n\nEveryone in\
  \ the group had travel books and had some general concept of what to do once we\
  \ got off the boat.\n\nI was clueless by choice.  No tour books, no guides.  Just\
  \ word of mouth.  Those were the rules I set a month ago, and it had worked so far.\
  \  I was still alive.\n\nOne step off the boat and the 20-25 backpackers (unaffectionately\
  \ referred to as \"farang\" by the locals) were surrounded by barkers trying to\
  \ sell us on their guesthouses, which like our last stop in Huay Xai, cost about\
  \ $10 or less per night.  I was ready to defer to the group, so I let my new friends\
  \ pick the direction to walk and I\u2019d just take charge of negotiations once\
  \ we got there.  We were lucky that the first place we walked into was relatively\
  \ modern, very clean and had a beautiful view of the river at sunset.  My new bff\
  \ Paddy and I had become inseparable roommates, and we grabbed a room to clean up\
  \ and ready for dinner.  Starving and restless after a day sitting on our butts,\
  \ the group didn\u2019t take long to meet up on the patio overlooking the river.\
  \  \n\nFew moments have ever brought so much clarity - the peace of not having a\
  \ phone or job or girlfriend or responsibility in the world to distract me, the\
  \ visual of untouched scenery of an extremely remote town hitting your eye like\
  \ blast of light, and the thrill of standing up despite feeling more exhaustion/dehydration\
  \ outside of the time I ran a marathon in Los Angeles.  That experience ended with\
  \ me curled up in a ball, crying hysterically into a mylar blanket, ten feet beyond\
  \ the finish line.\n\nThis was much better.\n\nAfter some reflection time - which\
  \ was probably just a few minutes but felt like hours - the eight of us headed out\
  \ to pick a restaurant while there was still light (the town would shut off all\
  \ electricity by 9pm).  We were having a merry time talking with the locals, who\
  \ seemed to think my hair and height were hilarious.  I didn't care at all, because\
  \ they introduced me into one of the briefest and most intense love affairs of my\
  \ life, to Lao whiskey.\n\nScrew American moonshine.  This stuff would give the\
  \ Duke brothers of Hazzard county a serious run for their money.\n\nTwo shots later,\
  \ I was gone."
