Text: "Ringggg\u2026 my mobile buzzed, defying the serenity of the sparkling snow\
  \ clad peak of Apharwat, Gulmarg. \n\nI reached for my phone wondering who could\
  \ it be, disturbing the sheer peace at 14000 ft? A call from the airline canceling\
  \ our flight back to Delhi the next day, pushed me back to the reality. Slowly,\
  \ absorbing the news, I decided to inform my husband and daughter after reaching\
  \ Srinagar. They were happily playing in the snow unaware of this. \n\nIt was late\
  \ afternoon by the time we returned to the car. As we settled down, we felt something\
  \ was wrong with Aijaz Bhai. Our ever smiling guide and driver seemed rattled. A\
  \ handsome and positive man in his late 20\u2019s, whose entire mission was to make\
  \ sure our trip was pleasurably memorable! \n\nAfter a lot of coaxing he said, \u201C\
  stone pelting has started on our way back to Srinagar, and they are targeting cars!\u201D\
  \n\nImmediately an unknown fear engulfed us, but we tried to comfort him. \u201C\
  I HAVE to drop you back safe in Srinagar.\u201D He declared. While descending from\
  \ the deep green mountains covered in tall pine and willow trees, we spotted the\
  \ convoy of ex-chief minister of Kashmir, and decided to trail them. Though we spotted\
  \ quite a few evidence of stone pelting, we did not encounter any ourselves.\n\n\
  We reached Srinagar around sunset, was about to get dropped, when he exclaimed,\
  \ \u201Coh you didn\u2019t have lunch?\u201D Yes, we forgot about lunch, partly\
  \ because of fear, and partly because of the thrill to witness a live stone pelting\
  \ incident. Crazy us! \n\nWe hesitated, it was the first day of Ramzan, and he needed\
  \ to break his fast. But, he stopped the car at a restaurant near Daal Lake. When\
  \ we offered him to join us, he declined it politely saying, \u201CI will go home\
  \ and eat. It's my chance to bond with my family.\u201D As we enjoyed the delicious\
  \ food, we kept talking about him... had we not come here, we would have never known\
  \ how beautiful and generous Kashmiris are. \n\nDropping us to the shikara - a manual\
  \ boat used to ferry tourists; he reiterated, \u201Cyou will be fully safe here\u201D\
  , waited for us to wade away, finally left home. An invisible connect was forming\
  \ between us!\n\nA day later, while dropping us at the Srinagar airport, he asked\
  \ \u201CCan I invite you for my wedding?\u201D \u201CWow! When is it?\u201D We were\
  \ visibly excited. He coyly responded, \u201CInshallah! sometime next year, once\
  \ my family finds the perfect bride.\u201D We cracked up. \n\nAs we boarded the\
  \ flight, we knew we are surely coming back for Aijaz Bhai\u2019s wedding\u2026\
  \ after all, how can we miss our brother\u2019s wedding!"
