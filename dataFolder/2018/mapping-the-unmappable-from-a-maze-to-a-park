Text: "In Udaipur, Rajasthan, India, I was low and dark-spirited. As if my mood crept\
  \ in a tunnel. The forts, palaces, and big bazaars quickly felt like a maze, so\
  \ I slowed down. Besides finding green space on google maps, I hadn\u2019t done\
  \ much research on the park. Surprisingly, in this single park, my eyes glittered\
  \ past a musical fountain that sang, water fountain that sprayed, mini zoo, speakers\
  \ playing what could be the best \u2018walk in the park\u2019 melody, curious students\
  \ on a field trip, jumpy children on trolley train, a continuously-rooted garden,\
  \ mosque, shrine, library, and a sign that read: \u201CPollution. If you don\u2019\
  t kill it, it will you kill you.\u201D I was amazed. I was continuously surprised\
  \ by the parks diversity and variety of intimate moments. I felt transformed and\
  \ lifted from the dark tunnel. Connection locally sometimes can mean going to the\
  \ park.\n\nI wish I had the powers to map the unmappable. \n\nI wandered around\
  \ Gulabh Bagh park for too long. My stomach ordered me to chase dinner. I stopped\
  \ by a guava stand, got some chili and salt sprinkled across the watermelon-sized\
  \ soft guava. I almost skipped in delight as my taste buds twisted and turned from\
  \ the tangy zesty flavors. Nearby was a jewelry shop, but the shopkeeper\u2019s\
  \ daughter sparkled prouder than any jewelry. I was mesmerized by her fluffy pink\
  \ sweater and her shy smile whenever she spoke. Her mother and brother joined us\
  \ that evening as we chatted over schools, politics, and global change. The conversations\
  \ of leaders. They lavished me with gifts, I bought the earrings, we took photos,\
  \ and we called it a night.\n\nUnknowingly, a tiny bug infested with extreme guilt\
  \ bite me. \n\nThe fireworks in my stomach began to explode once realizing I accepted\
  \ their gifts, knowing I wouldn\u2019t be able to return. Suddenly, I remembered\
  \ something beautiful- I forgot my camera cap in their shop! A perfect reason to\
  \ return- but not empty-handed. I purchased candies, chips, and chocolate in quantities\
  \ that would match the mass of a newborn child. I received confused looks from the\
  \ five men buying what looked to be a homemade healthy cigarette- tobacco and spices\
  \ rolled in a banana leaf. The fireworks faded and I left their shop that night\
  \ feeling fulfilled. \n\nThe massive attractions in Udaipur were dimensioned by\
  \ the sparkles of the park, the tanginess of guava stand, and the shy smile of the\
  \ shopkeeper\u2019s daughter. \n\nThe spirit of adventure hasn\u2019t lead me to\
  \ mazes anymore."
