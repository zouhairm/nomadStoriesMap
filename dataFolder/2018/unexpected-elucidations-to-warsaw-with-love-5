Text: "I peered in through the taxi window, waving as he sat and read a newspaper.\
  \ I didn't want to knock, in case he's offended. My first work trip abroad, which\
  \ I had been so excited for, wasn\u2019t going quite as expected. Not many people\
  \ acknowledged me, so I had stopped trying to talk to anyone unless absolutely necessary.\n\
  \           I stood there unsure if he'd notice me. But he did. And he smiled. He\
  \ hurriedly opened the door, apologizing in a language I barely understood. But\
  \ I knew the word sorry and identified it in his frantic comments. \u2018Przepraszam\u2019\
  . I felt terrible. I asked him if he spoke English. He seemed embarrassed and I\
  \ felt worse. So I just told him the address and we left. He kept smiling at me\
  \ in the rearview mirror and talking in Polish. I kept replying, \u2018Przepraszam,\
  \ I don't understand\u2019 and waiting for this awkward ride to be over soon. \n\
  \ We were at a red light when a lady walked by with two big dogs. He pointed to\
  \ them excitedly and asked if I liked dogs. I nodded saying very much so. He gestured\
  \ he had one too, a big one as well but only one, not two. I gestured I had one\
  \ too, a small one, but only one, not two.\n         He continued talking and I\
  \ now started nodding instead, amazed at how much he had to say to me. Most drivers\
  \ got annoyed with my pronunciation and sighed when they figured out what I was\
  \ saying and how wrong I was saying it. None of them ever tried to talk to me.\n\
  \ I found him again the next day. This time, I knocked. During the ride, he gestured\
  \ that everyone around frowns about the cold while I smile, bright like sunshine.\
  \ It remains one of the nicest things anyone has ever said to me. The next time\
  \ he got me chocolates. The next, he took a detour to show me a park and refused\
  \ to take the whole fare. Another time, he called his daughter who spoke English\
  \ to translate for us. He wanted to know my name. She told me he talked about me\
  \ everyday and said I reminded him of her. \n We had so many wordless conversations\
  \ that these cab rides became the highlight of my day and regular entries in my\
  \ journal. This one kind man affected my experience so much more than I could ever\
  \ manage to tell him.\n My trip ended sooner than expected and I was to return in\
  \ two days. I remember having translated and written on a piece of paper, \u2018\
  I\u2019m going back. I\u2019d miss our cab rides and I\u2019m so happy I met you\u2019\
  , in Polish. I kept practicing how to say it while eagerly looking for his cab.\
  \ The one time I knew the words, I never got a chance to say them."
