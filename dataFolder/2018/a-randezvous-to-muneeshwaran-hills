Text: It was Around 6am when me&my fiance were at the base of  Muneeshwaran hill with
  view point covering scenic beauty in 360*.the neighbourhood was fast asleep.the
  empty roads through alternate street lights and darkness&forest areas took us tho
  this place.its about 1.5km away from the National highway where a narrow pocket
  road with farmland on either sides.finally we reached at a junction where  the routeto
  destination appeared steep&full of rocks.it was quite risky to take a two wheeler
  through that steep offroad.we parked our bike near to that junction& phone's torchlight
  lead the way.There were houses on either sides.as we walk uphill the path was harder
  to climb as i even felt difficult to catch breath.we reached at hairpin bend few
  metres away from our destination.We rested there for a while as we were early for
  the sunrise.that point has a 180*view.at first there were only fog and blurred vison
  of the valley.sounds from the distant valley came along with the wind few minute
  later we started the final ascend.few tents and electrified fences appeared.that
  place was under government forest range protection.We couldnt find anyone around.we
  walked along the electrified fences suddenly we noticed some movement on a nearby
  hillside.Curiously we took a closer look.it was a herd of wild buffalos. We were
  exited to see them cause one can hardly see them outside the zoo.from one of the
  tent a forest guard showedup.the guard opened the gate noted our personal details&permited
  us to go to the viewpoint.the wind became thicker.it drifted the fog over the valley&
  the sight became more distinct.the sun peeked through thick fluffy clouds&fine warm
  rays touched the grounds of distant valley it was such a beauty that no camera can
  record it.on the opposite side a full clear rainbow was formed.for a moment i realised
  if ididnt make the right choice then i would never be able to get such a beautiful
  magical morning blessed by the mother nature.we sat there few hours admiring the
  breathtaking beauty of that valley and varying shades of green all around.the hill
  seems to have so many folds wuth green blanket on it .the wind was so refreshing
  and few drewdrops wet our skin.And even sunkissed.as the sun shine brighter  up
  high the warmer the greenfield became .we realised its time to get down.as We return
  leaving the mesmerising beauty   behind i turned up and look into those greenfolds
  i thanked almighty and the mother nature for the treat  said bye...bye till we meet
  again.
