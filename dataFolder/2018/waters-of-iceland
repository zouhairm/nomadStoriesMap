Text: "My husband leaned back in his chair and swirled the ice cubes in his glass.\
  \  \u201CYou know what I remember most about Iceland?\u201D he asks.  I already\
  \ know the answer.  He has been saying the same thing since we returned from our\
  \ wintry sojourn.  What does he miss most?  \u201CThe water.\u201D\n\nIceland is\
  \ a land coursing with waters.  So what \u201Cwater\u201D exactly is he talking\
  \ about?\n\nPerhaps the waterfalls?  Iceland is inundated with them - large ones,\
  \ small ones, tall ones, short ones, brown ones, blue ones, roaring ones, trickling\
  \ ones, even rainbow hued ones.  You get the idea.  We saw countless numbers of\
  \ them:  powerful and isolated Dettifoss, picturesque yet crowded Gullfoss, rainbow\
  \ cloaked Sk\xF3gafoss, and myriads of others, each beautiful in their uniqueness\
  \ yet treacherous with trails sheathed in ice.  That, however, is not what my husband\
  \ meant.\n\nIceland is also a land full of steaming geothermal springs: natural,\
  \ man-made, crowded, isolated, scorching, or soothing.  The Blue Lagoon beckons\
  \ over half a million visitors each year with its mud masks, saunas, and layover\
  \ locale.  Tourists also enjoy the natural beauty of the Nature Baths and Secret\
  \ Lagoon, while those more adventurous trek to natural pools scattered throughout\
  \ the countryside.  Game of Thrones enthusiasts seek out the scalding pool of Grj\xF3\
  tagj\xE1 where we happened upon a cellist who transformed that otherwise unobtrusive\
  \ and mundane cave into a magnificent concert hall.  But that is not what my husband\
  \ meant either. \n\nPerhaps he meant the crystal clear waters of Silfra, where we\
  \ geared up in dry suits and snorkels in the snow to immerse ourselves in frigid\
  \ waters shrouded in dancing colors?  Or maybe he meant the waters of the deafening\
  \ waves of the Atlantic on the Dyrh\xF3laey arch?  Or even the frozen waters of\
  \ each immense iceberg deposited along the beach near the J\xF6kuls\xE1rl\xF3n glacier\
  \ lagoon?  If not those, perchance the frozen waters that coat vast, barren tracts\
  \ of treeless, mountainous wilderness blanketed with snow and rime, where scrappy\
  \ Icelandic horses stand defiant against each frosty gale?  Maybe those are what\
  \ my husband meant?\n\nNo.  Unexpected as it may be, what he yearns for is not any\
  \ of those iconic Icelandic waters.  Instead, what he misses most is a dreamlike\
  \ elixir, refreshing and cool, clear and flavorful.  More intoxicating than the\
  \ smoothest of wines, more invigorating than the most pungent of coffees.  What\
  \ he misses most is the drinking water.  Could you please pass me another glass?"
