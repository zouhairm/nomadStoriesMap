Text: "It was one of those moments that I\u2019m not sure really happened at all.\
  \ There is no tangible evidence that I was ever there. Just the memory sitting in\
  \ my mind waiting for a specific smell or sound to take me right back to where I\
  \ was on that night.\n\nSuddenly I\u2019m there at some strange beach on the other\
  \ side of the world, on the night when my reality shifted. Feeling the coldness\
  \ of the sand seeping through my clothes and watching as the brilliantly red moon\
  \ slipped beyond the horizon I realised I am not and will never be the same person\
  \ I was when I left to go on that journey.\n\nThere was the sound of accented singing\
  \ somewhere in the distance and the spray of paint from a can subtly mixing in with\
  \ the crash of the waves that allowed us to stay unnoticed. We had discussed earlier\
  \ about how wrong this could go, of the very real danger that could arise at any\
  \ given moment. However, sitting there under the cover of darkness, watching my\
  \ Australian friend whom I had met a couple of weeks earlier, create a masterpiece\
  \ from strokes of blue and orange, I felt more comfortable than I probably should\
  \ have.\n\nWith embracing a change in my plans I found myself in the middle of a\
  \ community that I never knew existed. I saw that my friends world revolved around\
  \ paint shops and finding the best walls and seeing an opportunity for art everywhere.\
  \ Graffiti artists, get a bad rap. There\u2019s an injustice in the world not always\
  \ seeing their art as beautiful but their foundations are built on a process of\
  \ labour and love. There is always a plan to get a message across, to shock people,\
  \ to put a bit of colour in a concrete jungle, to make someone smile. It\u2019s\
  \ the importance of art that, like the artist, doesn\u2019t have time for you to\
  \ see and admire it forever, because it has more things to do, or, someone else\
  \ is already painting over it. The importance of art that makes you feel everything\
  \ with one glance.\n\nIn the midst of it all, sometimes you have to take a step\
  \ back and trust in the world a little bit. I had had a multitude of different mind\
  \ altering experiences that could have been the key to that realisation, but somehow\
  \ that specific moment was the catalyst to all of this. Only there could I see that\
  \ moments of adrenaline and quick decision making and letting feelings drive me\
  \ more than logic or perhaps rational thought can lead me to experiences of overwhelming\
  \ importance. \n\nAnyway, it's also a nice thought, to know that my name is written\
  \ in a country that changed my world."
