Text: "Winding cautiously up the cobbled road, our Uber driver Rodrigo glanced at\
  \ me in the review mirror. \u201CYou go to party?\u201D, he recited slowly from\
  \ a translation on his phone. We were venturing at nightfall deep into the heart\
  \ of Rio\u2019s mountains, unchartered territory that even some Cariocas (Brazilian\
  \ residents) were not familiar with. The sudden turns and bends on the steep incline\
  \ amplified our eagerness to arrive. A local I met the day before had shared with\
  \ me two pieces of information; an address and a name. \"Maze. It's a place you'll\
  \ never forget\". As two gringos entering foreign land, would we be safe?\n\n\u201C\
  First time in favela?\u201D enquired Rodrigo. My clueless travel companion, Alice,\
  \ instantly glared in my direction and emphatically mouthed \u2018FAVELA?\u2019\
  . She looked like she wanted to strangle me. The word 'favela' is Brazilian Portuguese\
  \ for a slum; an area of lower socio-economic status. Favelas have gained a bad\
  \ reputation as being incredibly dangerous places; hubs for drug cartels and criminal\
  \ activity. Not a place to wander alone at night!\n\nWe reached a dead end flanked\
  \ with shacks and one tiny market. Was this the right address? Barely any signs\
  \ of life were visible, let alone a party. Edging out of the car cautiously, we\
  \ were approached by a stocky man dressed in black. He surprised us with a welcoming\
  \ gaze, as he uttered \u201CMaze\u201D, and indicated to an alleyway. The laneway\
  \ appeared squashed between two over towering adjacent structures, twisting haphazardly.\
  \ On the verge of claustrophobia, the name \u2018Maze\u2019 could not have been\
  \ more accurate. We had entered a chaotic urban jungle. Power lines hung from unknown\
  \ crevasses above, interweaving like mating vipers. Bright eyes glared out at us\
  \ from the depth of the shadows, guiding us to our destination\u2026 \n\nTHE MAZE.\
  \ Two words marked the entrance to the guesthouse. Climbing up the stairs through\
  \ an arched doorway, a familiar, hypnotic melody drew me in. Resembling a sculptural\
  \ cave more so than a hotel, curved walls and rounded ceilings guided us into the\
  \ main room where a dapper, upbeat Jazz band entertained a crowd of Brazil\u2019\
  s hippest socialites. I was in awe. Here, time had frozen. We had discovered a haven\
  \ in the midst of the surrounding chaos, transporting us into a parallel universe\
  \ from a past time. Stepping out onto the patio I felt a strange sense of d\xE9\
  j\xE0 vu. From this height the city of Rio seemed incredibly calm, a magnificent\
  \ panorama of an intoxicating place that had long been calling my name. Maze."
