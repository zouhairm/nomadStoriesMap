Text: "As a child, playing Find It If You Can, I would call out, \u2018Georgia!\u2019\
  \ and watch my friends running their fingers over the world map, looking at me quizzically.\
  \ My favourite part was showing them that nestled between the Black Sea and Caucasian\
  \ Range. A few weeks back, while at a wine tasting event hosted by my company, our\
  \ host spoke about the rare exquisiteness of Georgian Kakhetian wine. As I delved\
  \ deeper, I discovered 8000 year old wine in traditions handed down centuries as\
  \ far back as the from Stone Age. Wow!\n\nGaumorjos Georgia! (The toast is to Georgia!)\n\
  Wine is an integral part of Georgian rituals and celebrations; oral traditions and\
  \ songs. In some Georgian homes, the cellar is the holiest place in the home. The\
  \ wine consumed is produced by families for their own use. Georgia has over 520\
  \ indigenous distinct varieties of grapes, not found anywhere else in the world!\
  \ A kvevri is an enormous egg-shaped terracotta vessel used to make, age and store\
  \ wine. It is buried in the earth, protected by the consistently cool temperatures\
  \ of the ground. In a few months, the kvevri is opened again. \n\nSupra \u2013 The\
  \ Traditional Georgian Feast\nLocal families who make their own wine, have drinking\
  \ horns that are a cherished part of the traditional Georgian social and family\
  \ life. Toasting is a very important ritual at a Georgian table. The Georgian toast-making\
  \ tradition is one of the most flamboyant drinking rituals in the world. A toastmaster,\
  \ or Tamada, is a mainstay at feasts called \u2018Supra\u2019. The Tamada draws\
  \ upon a vast knowledge of toasts, folklore, songs and poetry about winemaking.\
  \ Georgian toasts are like speeches or stories, in which the speaker says something\
  \ personal about an important, emotional theme. Georgia also has more than 250 types\
  \ of cheese! It is so popular that there is one famous quote in Georgian \u201C\
  If you don\u2019t have Kveli (cheese in Georgian) at home, then you are dead\u201D\
  . Thus, clearly the Supra is unimaginable without Kveli. \n\nDance and Song\nDance\
  \ and song are an integral part of Georgian culture. A Greek historian, Xenophon\
  \ (approx. 3rd BC) has mentioned that some Georgian tribes went to war singing and\
  \ dancing. Georgian folklores have preserved both the Pagan and Christian epochs.\
  \ Georgia has a \u2018dancing dialect\u2019 which means that each region has its\
  \ own special manner of dancing and singing. \n\nSo, as I go in search of underground\
  \ kvevris, exquisite wines and flamboyant supras, I invite you to join me, Ts\u2019\
  avedit Georgia (Let\u2019s Go to Georgia)!"
