Text: "It took a full day to reach the village, most of the journey being upwards.\
  \ A friend had suggested coming here on my way south. Thankfully he also recommended\
  \ dimenhidrinato, Mexico\u2019s Gravol, to counter the effects of the rickety bus\
  \ ride up the winding mountain pass. On arriving my relief was balanced with surprise;\
  \ this isolated village merely a smattering of buildings along the roadside, falling\
  \ away in both directions to reveal tree-lined valleys shrouded in dense cloud.\n\
  \nA kid selling fresh juice from green oranges suggested I walk up the hill to a\
  \ wooden cabin that an elderly woman often rented to travelers. The view of the\
  \ valley was spectacular, the cliff edge separated from the door of the cabin by\
  \ a dirt path and a flimsy chicken wire fence. I dropped my bags, washed my face\
  \ in the outhouse and collapsed on the bed covered with traditional Oaxacan blankets:\
  \ rows of diamonds weaved in red, blue and gold.\n\nWaking at dusk I went out in\
  \ search of the one bar that opened at night, situated on the edge of the village.\
  \ I drank oversized glasses of wine as the owner described the local history of\
  \ using psilocybin mushrooms in shamanic ceremonies, and the extranjeros and Mexicans\
  \ who flock to the village in high season.\n\nIn the darkness the walk back was\
  \ eerie; the air thick with the electricity of an approaching storm. Climbing the\
  \ overgrown hill was hard by moonlight alone so I stopped to locate my torch. In\
  \ my periphery a black shape unfolded from the darkness. I froze as limbs tightened\
  \ around my waist.\n\nIt was a whimpering dog, terrified by the storm. It gripped\
  \ tighter as a streak of lightning shot down the valley, briefly turning the infinite\
  \ blackness into a perfectly illuminated mosaic of green ferns. I prized the creature\
  \ off me so I could navigate the narrow path, one hand patting its head in reassurance.\
  \ The storm was dramatic from the cliff's edge and I was becoming glad of my animal\
  \ companion. I briefly entered the outhouse, leaving the dog outside. When I came\
  \ out it had vanished.\n\nThe air inside was like soup, the tentacles of the storm\
  \ reaching deep into the cabin. I laid motionless under the blankets looking out\
  \ of the small curtainless window, as each flash of lightning illuminated the room.\
  \ I have no memory of falling asleep but when I awoke it was a tranquil day in a\
  \ beautiful mountaintop village with no storm or black dog in sight. Pausing briefly\
  \ I packed my things and bought a ticket for the first bus headed to the Oaxacan\
  \ coast."
