Text: "While taking a break from a hike in the Andean Mountains of Pampamarca, I spotted\
  \ a girl with a herd of black goats. I watched her playfully balance on a dead tree\
  \ log as her goats munched on leaves. I walked closer and greeted her Hola with\
  \ a smile. She said Hola back. Feeling somewhat lonely, given the remoteness of\
  \ the area, I felt excited by the chance to connect with another human being. Twelve-year-old\
  \ Mariela related that she was taking her goats home from another village which\
  \ had more plants available for grazing. Taking the goats home was her daily chore\
  \ after school. Her family raised the goats for food. Mariela seemed enthused talking\
  \ about her family and she was very curious about mine that she even asked the names\
  \ of my parents. Her eyes widened when I told her about my travels to other countries.\
  \ Seeing her interest, I showed her a few pictures from my cell phone of places\
  \ I visited. Soon, Mariela turned to a street that led to her home. We bid farewell\
  \ and wished each other well. \n\nEarlier that morning, as I ascended to the Forest\
  \ of Stones of Huito, I saw the village dwindle, appearing as one cohesive unit.\
  \ I thought about the remoteness and ruggedness of the region. I doubted people\
  \ there visit the city often or go anywhere else outside their region. Getting to\
  \ Pampamarca required a total of three bus rides from the main city of Arequipa.\
  \ It took me sixteen hours of traveling on narrow and unpaved roads along the mountains.\
  \ The village had two small grocery stores that also served as restaurants and lodging.\
  \ The people grew alfalfa to feed their animals and they held daily meetings to\
  \ figure out the source of their water supply. The people smiled and greeted me.\
  \ In Pampamarca, there is an undeniable simplicity and slow pace of life which I\
  \ suspect highly contributed to the ease and carefree attitude of its inhabitants.\
  \ \n\nAt dinner that night, I met more of the locals at the plaza and chatted with\
  \ a retired gentleman from Lima. At 12,000 feet, the village seemed like a place\
  \ where I could put a ladder up to the clear unpolluted sky, sparkling with so many\
  \ stars.  \n\nI feel grateful for my time in Pampamarca. The spiky cone rocks, panoramic\
  \ views of canyons and mountains were awe-inspiring, but I received so much more.\
  \ I was able to peek in the lives of the locals and connect with Mariela. I was\
  \ inspired to take life at a slower pace and realize that even with the lack of\
  \ conveniences brought about technology, people can still be happy."
