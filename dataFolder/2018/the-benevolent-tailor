Text: "\u201CSo, what are you giving up for Lent?\u201D Chifundo asked me. It was\
  \ a Sunday morning. Her tinny transistor radio was playing some distant hymns, as\
  \ she worked confidently on her old, hand-operated Singer sewing machine, joining\
  \ together some colourful chitenge fabric. Goats bleated and chickens squawked in\
  \ the immaculately swept yard. \nIt was an innocent question; Chifundo knew I was\
  \ a Catholic, but she didn\u2019t know I was a lapsed one. I thought about the things\
  \ I used to refrain from for just 40 days \u2013 booze, chocolate, cigarettes, TV,\
  \ Facebook. Chifundo knew nothing of these things. This was Malawi, allegedly the\
  \ poorest country in the world. What could Chifundo possibly have that she could\
  \ give up? \nI was living in a very poor, rural area of southern Malawi, working\
  \ for a non-government organisation (NGO) in the school that they had built. The\
  \ village of Nanthomba was 18km down one of the millions of sun-parched dirt tracks\
  \ which deviate off every pot-holed tarmac B-road all across the continent of Africa.\n\
  I had asked the school\u2019s tailor, Chifundo, if she would teach me how to sew.\
  \ She was a single mother, with two children. Her home was typical of the area;\
  \ a simple house made of baked clay adobe, wooden frames at the windows, but no\
  \ glass. Two rooms inside, but no furniture, just a rattan mat to eat and sleep\
  \ on. Chifundo grew her maize around this house and prayed every year for rains.\
  \ A good harvest would provide her with enough maize flour to make nsima, the thick\
  \ porridge which is the staple of every Malawian meal, for a year. Life was tough\
  \ \u2013 Chifundo was happy that I was paying her for some sewing lessons. \nWe\
  \ had gotten to know each other well in the hours spent in the shade of her dusty\
  \ front stoop. She had lived in this area all of her life. Her children had never\
  \ been to the tarmac end of that dirt road. They did not have money to get there,\
  \ or money to spend there if they did.\n\u201CI haven\u2019t really thought about\
  \ what to give up,\u201D I replied. \u201CWhat are you going to give up?\u201D \n\
  Without pause, she said; \u201CAt meal times, we usually take two patties of nsima.\
  \ At Lent, we just eat one patty, and give the other to those who are poorer than\
  \ us.\u201D\nMy heart panged. To think there were others in a less fortunate situation\
  \ than Chifundo was hard to fathom. But she considered that she had more than enough.\
  \ This is what living with the poorest people in the world can teach you \u2013\
  \ humility, appreciation, kindness, resilience \u2013 and hope. I won\u2019t forget\
  \ those lessons."
