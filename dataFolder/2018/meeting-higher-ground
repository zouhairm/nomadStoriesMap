Text: "It's said that the area of our brains in charge of processing our senses is\
  \ shared with storage for some of our emotionally charged memories. Sight, smell,\
  \ sound, taste, and touch collapse into a synaptic signal to record a single moment.\
  \ I was unaware that at the end of a hike above the green valleys of Oaxaca, Mexico,\
  \ I\u2019d be standing 10 feet from the edge of a cliff that stood high like royalty\
  \ half a mile up from the valley floor. How many people would perch at a precipice\
  \ to feel what it\u2019s like to sit on a throne?\nIt\u2019s warm and heavily windy\
  \ here in July. The forceful breeze is reminding me that I am standing now 9 feet\
  \ too close to the edge of a rock formation dubbed as a petrified waterfall. Relatable.\
  \ I visited Oaxaca in search of escape from all of the fears and pressures I put\
  \ on myself. By now I should have a stable job, living a fulfilled happy life, right?\
  \ I\u2019m 8 feet out and my floppy hat almost blew away. Stable? I\u2019m wearing\
  \ old boots and can feel the pebbles of minerals that have chipped into my soles.\
  \ The fabric of my flowing chiffon skirt whirs like a proud Mexican flag, wrapping\
  \ around my legs like a second skin. My fear gets a hold of my knees and my hands\
  \ take to the gravel. Grateful for gravity, but 7 feet closer and Newton can show\
  \ me what uncertainty really looks like.\nThis trip was a big step in doing something\
  \ for myself. I was on the verge of a meltdown. Now 5 feet away, how familiar this\
  \ knot in my throat feels. I take in a deep breath and exhale with Hierve el Agua's\
  \ hot springs said to have healing properties. The sun hugging my back like it missed\
  \ me. This knot like a cocoon unraveling into butterflies. A smile emerged 3 feet\
  \ from the curve of this mountain, parallel to the cliffside, I could taste minerals\
  \ in my teeth. The giant pressing into my kneecaps, earth engraining into my lifelines\
  \ and a grip rerooting me into this native ground. My palms, now just a couple of\
  \ feet away from the brink as I peek down to the vast green below; enough to see\
  \ what air looks like gliding over treetops whispering, \u201CLook how far you\u2019\
  ve come.\u201D\nWhat a reminder that even in nature one must be submissive to royalty.\
  \ I, but a teetering servant just a foot from a 90-degree vertical shelf on the\
  \ planet, bowing to the universe with unquestionable clarity, suddenly smell fresh\
  \ mango and chamoy. My mother calls for me, fork-in-hand, chewing on fruit, saying,\
  \ \u201CAre you gonna crawl around this ridge all day? We have to hike back down,\
  \ the bus leaves soon.\u201D"
