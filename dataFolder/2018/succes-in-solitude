Text: "People often confuse \u2018alone\u2019 with \u2018lonely\u2019. One doesn\u2019\
  t quite learn to be on their own without missing somebody. We aim to belong to groups\
  \ of likeminded individuals and though nothing\u2019s wrong with that, going solo\
  \ can be very liberating. Challenging my own alone-ness boundaries, in search of\
  \ this very liberation, I hiked the Austrian Alps. By myself. The heaviest part\
  \ of my luggage was my expectation of being proud of myself. Unfortunately after\
  \ my first peak, I wasn\u2019t. I felt rather deflated. I hadn\u2019t met my own\
  \ courage nor had I pr\xF3ven anything. This started changing when I tightly laced\
  \ up my boots to set foot on a mountain known for it\u2019s treachery. The unpredictable\
  \ rock formations had me in awe as I ascended a steep track that took me to a lake\
  \ seemingly mirroring the entire universe, the sky so clear I felt like I could\
  \ swim in it. There I was; frolicking through ashy stone, climbing arrangements\
  \ of graveled rock on a black route at about 9000 feet, when something suddenly\
  \ entered the air around me. A fog bank moved in, grabbing the body of water I had\
  \ just so admired. Surrounded by dark clouds I looked up at the crest that lay only\
  \ fifteen minutes ahead and back the way I came several times. This, is Mother Nature,\
  \ I was crazy to go on, but I couldn\u2019t just let her take this from me. I, was\
  \ going for the summit! Visibility soon dimmed to a blur, disorientation struck.\
  \ I carefully placed my feet, until I literally couldn\u2019t tell soil from air.\
  \ Then, right in front of me, rising up through the mist, was the cross! As I touched\
  \ it, I felt at peace. But not for long\u2026 thunder voiced it\u2019s presence,\
  \ demanding me to go down, NOW! My boots slid across boulders, my wrist hurting\
  \ from breaking a fall. My only chance of safely navigating my way back, was by\
  \ accepting fate and taking caution. A certain serenity accompanied me as I continued\
  \ with less haste in my stride and right below the timberline; the mist lifted.\
  \ Flowering fields appeared, wild horses everywhere. Back at the foothill, the hut\
  \ owner alleviated my soreness with a relieved smile. He had seen me leave and got\
  \ worried when he saw the weather turn. I raced through my story of fog banks and\
  \ slippery slopes and told him I had done the 6-hour trail in 4h18m. Disbelief was\
  \ present, when telling him I had made it all the way up. Some of you may laugh.\
  \ Me making it seem like I climbed Everest. But emotionally, I did. My self-possession\
  \ had made me proud. I did it and I did it alone, without being lonely."
