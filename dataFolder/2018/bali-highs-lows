Text: "I think traveling may be a genetic condition. A child in a family of travelers,\
  \ I was fortunate that, by high school, I\u2019d been to parts of the world that\
  \ many see only on TV. By the time I was in my 30s, I\u2019d traveled much of the\
  \ continental United States alone. However, I had not soloed internationally. From\
  \ the sidelines, I marveled at those who made such adventures seem effortless.\n\
  \nAll of that changed when Bali called. It\u2019s so clich\xE9 that writing it,\
  \ I have to fight the urge to roll my eyes. I sat with my WWII veteran-grandfather,\
  \ a small child watching South Pacific. Perhaps that\u2019s when I got Bali fever;\
  \ I don\u2019t think it came from reading Elizabeth Gilbert\u2019s Eat, Pray, Love.\n\
  \nThe work I was doing left my soul battered. An at-home yoga practice helped me\
  \ continue to face each day. I justified taking time off from work primarily by\
  \ attending trainings. I did some research, but I mostly relied on my gut to select\
  \ a yoga teacher training in Bali. Never intent on being a yoga teacher, I hoped\
  \ to learn enough to benefit my home practice.\n\nThe day I flew to Bali, I worked.\
  \ That day my job was eliminated; I would return from Bali, work 3 days, and be\
  \ laid off. Stunned, I went home to pick up my bag. Instead, in a panic, I repacked\
  \ for what seemed like the 87th time. Driving to the airport in the middle of the\
  \ night felt as though I was stepping off of a cliff.\n\nA month of Bali days passed\
  \ in a blur: some fast, some painfully slow. Mostly, I agonized: laboring through\
  \ physical poses, memorizing Sanskrit, in private, delving into the torture I\u2019\
  d subjected my mind to for years. The bit of countryside I saw was so incongruous\
  \ to my experience and the training that it was surreal.\n\nReturning home was challenging.\
  \ Training was complete; it was impossible to relax my last to 2 days in Bali. I\
  \ traveled to Ubud, half expecting to eat, pray, or love there. Mostly, I wanted\
  \ to go home and face the music, all 3 days of it.\n\nSince Bali High, everything\
  \ about my life has changed. Selling a house, spending a year on a 40,000-mile road\
  \ trip, camping, hiking, backpacking, learning, connecting, and re-connecting will\
  \ do that for a person. I have come to rest in a new place that feels like home\
  \ for the first time. I am just beginning to teach yoga.\n\nMy genetic predisposition\
  \ to travel continues to change me, although it often still feels as though I\u2019\
  m stepping off of a different cliff everyday. And, in spite of having physically\
  \ been, Bali remains a place I\u2019d like to know."
