Text: "As I walked my way up to the India\u2019s most haunted, I noticed some of the\
  \ arched doors had been shut with metal gates. Why were they like this, the height\
  \ wasn\u2019t much that someone could fall and result in an unfortunate situation,\
  \ I wondered. Moreover it was only these on the right side which were gated, a few\
  \ on the other side were still open.\n\nThe mystery was killing me, I stood their\
  \ wondering what could be the reason for this unsymmetrical implementation. The\
  \ perfectionist in me was running haywire trying to find a symmetrical connection.\
  \ Was it another mystery which added to the hauntedness of this place or was it\
  \ an honest mistake, I asked myself.\n\nStanding there clueless for minutes, I realized\
  \ it was drizzling. My chances of capturing these arches with the camera were gone.\
  \ But my good old phone came to the rescue. While I clicked from my phone I recalled\
  \ the earlier days of my travel sans the camera. The numerous phone clicks which\
  \ led me to pursue my passion. The clicks which helped me realize that I wasn\u2019\
  t doing it to be a part of the rat-race but because I drew inspiration from it.\n\
  \nI looked up and clicked these arched doors and thats when it struck me. Had they\
  \ not been different, I would have not pushed my thinking and instead moved ahead.\
  \ They made me stop and wonder, I even forgot it was raining, the rain took away\
  \ my chance of clicking through a camera only to let me capture it with the phone.\
  \ The phone, through which it all began. Yes, they reminded me of where I began\
  \ and to humbly remember it always no matter where I am in the future. And that\u2019\
  s the reason why someone decided to gate only these and not the others!"
