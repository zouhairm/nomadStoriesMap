Text: "The evening\u2014one of our last on the Big Island of Hawaii\u2014was as romantic\
  \ as it gets. Chris and I sailed along the coast of Kailua-Kona on the Kamanu Catamaran\
  \ to Pawai Bay. The sky, still alit with the remnants of yet another mesmerizing\
  \ sunset, allowed us to get situated around the paddleboard floating in the dark\
  \ waters, its LED lights casting an eerie glow beneath us. We watched as several\
  \ manta rays performed graceful backflips while feeding on the microscopic plankton\
  \ drawn to our lights.\n The next day, we sat on a patio overlooking the cruise\
  \ ships in \u014Cneo Bay and enjoyed the first mai tai of the day. I logged onto\
  \ the free wifi to check in to our flight, which I thought was the next afternoon,\
  \ but was actually that morning. We had missed it by hours, but it might as well\
  \ have been days.\n I sat behind the wheel of our beat up Echo, struggling to confront\
  \ the steep hills along Saddle Road on the three hour drive back to the hotel we\
  \ should have checked out of that morning. I secretly hoped to make it to the next\
  \ gas station, 50 miles away, before we hit empty.\n Chris sat shotgun with my phone\
  \ on speaker, so we could both hear him sweet talk the airline\u2019s customer service\
  \ agent. He also called the car rental company, the hotel in Kauai, and the hotel\
  \ we were heading back to for an unplanned extra night. None of them were sympathetic\
  \ to our cause.\n We pulled up to our jungle hut just after the sun disappeared.\
  \ We sat on the king size bed sharing red curry and pad thai from a Thai restaurant\
  \ in the nearby town of P\u0101hoa and a grocery store bottle of red wine. \n Finally,\
  \ we could laugh at the mix up and talk about the day, trying to salvage what was\
  \ left of it. We just had to look out the screened windows above our bed at the\
  \ lush rainforest around us to understand there are far worse places to be. We were\
  \ together in paradise, even if it cost a few hundred extra in change fees and penalties.\n\
  \ Chris got up to refill our wine, but instead grabbed the worn leather backpack\
  \ he had been lugging around with us all week. He sat down on the bed and looked\
  \ at me in desperation, stunned into silence.\n He reached into the backpack and\
  \ pulled out a glossy black box, explaining he was waiting for the perfect moment.\
  \ After a stressful day, he was determined to turn things around\u2014so he proposed.\
  \ It was the last thing I expected in that moment, but was the best way to ensure\
  \ our last day was one that we would always remember, and not just for the chaos\
  \ earlier in the day."
