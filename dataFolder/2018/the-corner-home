Text: "As I turned the last block to reach the hotel I stopped as if I had hit a brick\
  \ wall. In an un-light corner, a couple feet off the sidewalk, I saw the silhouette\
  \ of a person laying on a wooden table. As my eyes adjusted to the darkness, the\
  \ silhouette took shape of a woman and she was cradling a baby in her arms. A toddler\
  \ sat beside her with a blank expression on his face. \nI couldn\u2019t move. I\
  \ felt like my entire body was covered in cement. My hands started shaking and my\
  \ eyes filled with tears. The air smelled of cabbage, urine and gasoline. The sidewalks\
  \ were as busy as the streets, from homeless dogs, locals selling brooms, to civilians\
  \ on foot going about their business. I couldn\u2019t imagine trying to put a baby\
  \ to sleep in such conditions.\nOnce again I was hit with the crude reality of poverty.\
  \ We had encountered numerous situations like this one during our 3-week stay, and\
  \ this woman was just one of the thousands in need. When faced with such a broad\
  \ scale of poverty, it was easy to become indifferent to it. ''We must do something!''\
  \ I said to my friend Bri, as she pulled me along to catch up with the group. My\
  \ friend's reply was logical and to-the-point, ''Rebekah, you can't save the whole\
  \ world''. \nI could still see the clear image of the baby in the arms of the woman\
  \ as we approached the hotel door. I thought, ''Is that it? We just walk by, become\
  \ numb to pain, and accept it as ''normal''?\nIn the hotel I grabbed David\u2019\
  s hand and pulled him back outside into the busy streets of Cebu. I needed to meet\
  \ his woman.  I led him back to the corner, and this time, instead of walking by\
  \ her, I walked straight to her. I asked what her name was, and she responded \u201C\
  Mahalia\u201D which means \u201Ctenderness\u201D. She told me she had been living\
  \ under a bridge with her family, but that now she slept anywhere on the street.\
  \ We bought Mahalia and her family some groceries and talked for a long time. I\
  \ will always have the image of all of us holding hands in a circle, praying, imprinted\
  \ in my mind. \nThat night as I lay in bed, disgusted at how comfortable I was,\
  \ I thought about how it is impossible to \u201Csave the whole world\u201D. If we\
  \ look at the world as masses of needy people, there will always be \u201Ctoo many\u201D\
  \ to help. The true impact comes when we begin to see the world with the face of\
  \ one individual at a time. Sometimes what we see as a \u2018problem\u2019, is actually\
  \ an amazing human being masked by the troubles of this world. One face at a time,\
  \ we can begin to uncover the masks."
