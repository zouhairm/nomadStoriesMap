Text: "The plane landed in Cusco and I imagined the adventure that lay ahead, 8 days\
  \ of mountain biking in the Peruvian Andes with two guides and four other riders.\
  \ We were brought together by our shared passion for two-wheeled travel, and our\
  \ endless curiosity of the world around us.\n\nCusco and the surrounding area is\
  \ crisscrossed with trail systems built long ago by the Inca Empire and still used\
  \ by farmers to shuttle herds of alpaca. My two knobby tires would become familiar\
  \ with the dirt trails and I would become familiar with the welcoming people, including\
  \ the kindness of one man I will never forget.\n\nWe awoke early and began the long\
  \ drive to the start of the day\u2019s 20-kilometer ride. The road turned to dirt\
  \ and our driver navigated countless switchbacks until we reached a remote trailhead\
  \ at 4000 meters. Just as the van stopped, the rain started. I exited the van and\
  \ the cold mountain air hit me.\n\nAs we started biking, the cold rain was relentless.\
  \ An hour in, my fingers went numb. I stopped to remove my wet gloves and stuck\
  \ my hands under my armpits. Once I regained some feeling, I hopped back on my bike.\
  \ Low-lying clouds had accumulated and it was difficult to see the other riders\
  \ who had pedaled into the mist.\n\nI couldn\u2019t depend on my fingers to brake\
  \ and I envisioned myself walking down the mountain. As I thought of stopping again,\
  \ I rode around a corner and came upon a modest hut with a straw roof - the only\
  \ home I\u2019d seen. A man, woman, and two children had come outside, curious about\
  \ the strangers on their doorstep. The family was Quechua, an indigenous people\
  \ from South America that still speak the language of the Inca. I decided to exercise\
  \ the universal language and smiled at the family. The man smiled back, realizing\
  \ my discomfort and guided me into his home.\n\nI crouched through the doorway and\
  \ took in my surroundings. Guinea pigs, a traditional cuisine in Peru, roamed the\
  \ dirt floor, and coals simmered in the corner. The man gathered some alpaca droppings\
  \ and threw them on the coals. Small flames ignited and he gestured for me to warm\
  \ my hands. I sat on the dirt floor and tried to express my gratitude.\n\nMy time\
  \ in Peru was never just about mountain biking; it was about experiencing different\
  \ ways of life. As I reflect back on that moment when a stranger in the Andes invited\
  \ me into his home, I recognize the most powerful connections can happen in an instant\
  \ and the thing that connects all of us is a simple warm smile."
