  \ idiot, scroll down, hmmm... maybe I write a comment, eee... no, scroll down, scroll\
  \ down... I went on a vacation, to change the environment, detach from everyday\
  \ problems, take a deep breath of fresh air and what? And I sit and watch my mates'\
  \ life and read about their problems.\n\nNO!!!\n\nTime to wake up, open the door\
  \ and leave the safe harbor of a hotel room! Go to meet the different world. Isn't\
  \ that what I dreamed about when I was sitting behind the desk staring at a computer\
  \ screen.\n\nI go outside, take a deep breath. The air smells. The smells are mixing.\
  \ Sweet flowers with old fish, fresh breeze, spring rain and rotten earth stench.\
  \ The air is my first touch to the local reality.\n\nI walk and watch. The city\
  \ is slowly waking up, fogs moving up, melting in the first rays of the sun. I listen\
  \ to the first noises of a new day. The birds, man sweeping the street, old diesel\
  \ engine starts, creaky loading carts, bikes pedaling, train passing by. The sounds\
  \ add it up to make an annoying hum in the middle of the day. Cars, trucks, busses\
  \ rushing, beeping, drivers yelling, kids screaming on schoolyards, workers digging,\
  \ electricians repairing cables, street sellers egging on to buy, waiters inviting\
  \ to restaurants. People chewing food, sipping drinks, chatting.  \n\nI keep going.\
  \ Turn left, turn right, turn around. The world behind my back looks completely\
  \ different. The magic of the sun. Looking toward the sun things are flat, colorless,\
  \ blinding. Shadows are blue and gray, details cannot be seen. The whole world seems\
  \ to be dirty and burned. Looking with the sun I see the most breath-taking sceneries.\
  \ Incredible colors. \n\nAs the sun is slowly setting and long shadows overlap peacefully\
  \ into the streets and put everything to sleep the noise calms down. People slowly\
  \ disappear into their houses, restaurants, bars. Streets fulfill with thousands\
  \ of whispering voices, silent music, television murmurs. \n\nThe evening is somehow\
  \ refreshing. I feel tired, my legs are heavy, back and hips hurt. But I am satisfied.\
  \ I touched the local culture, I tasted local food, I saw local people's life, I\
  \ heard their language, I sensed the new place with every piece of my body.\n\n\
  Tomorrow I can go and see the monuments, museums, and all the main tourist attraction."
