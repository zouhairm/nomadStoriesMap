Text: "Around the corner the ancient city looms up beneath us, an elaborate lego set\
  \ revealing itself under the stunning rise of the Peruvian sun. Elvis (our huge,\
  \ poker-faced Inca guide) is about to introduce the site when suddenly he wheels\
  \ around, as shocked as any of us to hear Annette, the diffident Dutch woman lugging\
  \ the giant backpack, clearing her throat: \"Excuse me, \u2026\" There is something\
  \ of great importance she needs to say. This is not in Elvis's script.\n\nFor virtually\
  \ every minute of the previous three-day trek Annette has stayed mute, indifferent,\
  \ seemingly unmoved by the cavernous valleys and jagged mountains that have enthralled\
  \ the rest of us. In the evenings she has retired to bed early, a meek \"Goodnight\"\
  \ her only word as she clambers into her tent, unwilling to join in the riotous\
  \ card playing and copious consumption of Pisco in front of the fire.\n\nShe has\
  \ remained at the back of the trek, struggling along with the backpack that almost\
  \ threatened to engulf her. Three times Elvis offered to help with the load; every\
  \ time his offer was rejected, a steely, almost manic determination in her eyes.\
  \ \"I'm fine.\" We had been advised to pack light, and were baffled and intrigued\
  \ by what could be inside. Teasingly, we placed bets in hushed voices. \"A guitar.\u201D\
  \ \u201CA pet llama.\u201D Had we only known...\n\nAnd now, at the top of Machu\
  \ Picchu, the normally boisterous group are quiet as the wind whips up around us.\
  \ Annette meets our eyes before beginning to speak. \"I booked this trip almost\
  \ a year ago,\" she shouts over the gust, her words in danger of being blown away\
  \ as we lean forward. \"It had always been my dream to see this place with my own\
  \ eyes, to taste the mystery, to smell the history.\" She pauses, seemingly lost\
  \ for a moment in the grip of the past. \" But it wasn't only my dream.\u201D\n\n\
  Dropping to her knees, she unzips the backpack, and it is at that moment that realization\
  \ hits us like water from a cold shower. She takes out the vase containing the ashes\
  \ of her dead husband, smiling softly as she caresses it, and speaks again. \"Here\
  \ it is, my darling.\" she whispers, turning the urn to face the stony paradise,\
  \ failing to hide the crack in her voice. \"Goodbye.\" She opens the lid, and grey\
  \ confetti dissipates over the now misty landscape, a celebration of a life lived.\
  \ There is silence, before spontaneous applause breaks out.\n\nAnd then we continue\
  \ on our exploration of the Lost City of the Incas, but not before I spy the taciturn\
  \ Elvis subtly wiping away a tear."
