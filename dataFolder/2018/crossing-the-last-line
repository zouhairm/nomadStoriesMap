Text: "We begin in a tattoo parlor where we find our narrator struggling between two\
  \ images.  An innocent butterfly and a fierce phoenix.\n\nWho is she?\n\nA woman\
  \ struggling to make peace with the death of her relationship instigated by an abusive\
  \ man. She must face him and walk through the minefield of his emotional blackmail\
  \ as she navigates her mental illness. Until one day she decides it's time to cross\
  \ an item off her 'someday' list and finds the courage to travel alone to Argentina.\n\
  \nArmed with her passport, her camera and enough meds for a month. One last call\
  \ from her ex has her flight response driving her forward, she is on her way.\n\n\
  Once there, with no lifeline and minimal ability to communicate she is faced with\
  \ a choice: stay as she is and wither away, or allow herself to grow and experience\
  \ life as she  ever imagined it.\n\nDrawn out of her shell by first her neighbors,\
  \ as they pull her to a family dinner, insisting she eat and praising her with warm\
  \ smiles.She pulls her camera out. Then facinated by the vendors, the buildings\
  \ that rise up around her and the very soul of the people around her, she blossoms\
  \ as she captures the images that she feels are Argentina .\n\nUpon returning home\
  \ she is faced with her ex and his demands. The challenges of day to day life. And\
  \ she finds that she has brought home with her not only amazing memories and photos,\
  \ but strength and resolve. \n\nHer ex tries to convince her to try again, and to\
  \ her own shock, she finds she has no desire to do so. Telling him no is frightening,\
  \ as he tries to bully her- but she doesn't bend. She found more than adventure\
  \ in her travels, she found her strength. And he finds her to be more than he bargained\
  \ for. As he slinks off,  tail tucked firmly between his legs he contemplates life\
  \ without her and shudders. She, has a glass of malbec and sets to editing her photos.\n\
  \nThe choice we leave her with is if she will display her photography, or allow\
  \ herself to continue to live in the shadows that she thinks are so comforting.\
  \ Is she still a solitary, lonely woman? Or is she strong enough to be vibrant and\
  \ intensely alive?\n\nIs life on her own with her cat and her camera enough? Or\
  \ has she learned she is enough, and is left with the choice between being a phoenix\
  \ or a butterfly.\n\nUltimately,  we return to her as she leaves the tattoo parlor\
  \ on her way to the gallery her photos on display in blazing color; the chimara\
  \ of butterfly and phoenix adorning her arm. \n\nShe passed through ashes and is\
  \ now free."
