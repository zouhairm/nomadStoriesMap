Text: "Her hand caressed the padlocks bound to the Hohenzollern train Bridge while\
  \ we walked on it, perhaps as a ritual of honoring all the lovers that sealed their\
  \ paths here. The Rhine, as muddy and gray as its city, flowed roaring beneath us.\
  \ \nThe bridge creaked as if it was Cologne\u2019s strained metal arm trying to\
  \ keep Rhine\u2019s coasts together.\n\u201CDuring New Year\u2019s Eve, they shoot\
  \ fireworks in the sky from the K\xF6lner Dom\u201D she almost sang, while waving\
  \ her right hand across the cloudy sky \u201CThe best place to watch them is Deutz\u201D\
  \ She pointed to the other side of the river, hundreds of meters away. \n\u201C\
  And there! The balancing man!\u201D she exclaimed, turning my attention to a sculptured\
  \ tin man that was balancing on a metal bar attached to the bridge, above the Rhine,\
  \ in what seemed like an eternal power struggle against gravity.\n\u201CHe is completely\
  \ made of recycled metal\u201D the woman noted. \nI turned at my right startled\
  \ by a train passing fast. A fence was dividing the pavement from a dive in the\
  \ rails, much like the one on our left, which instead prevented people from a free\
  \ fall to the Rhine. I looked back to the woman. To my surprise, she was somehow\
  \ standing now on the other side of that exact fence.\n\u201CRelax\u201D she said\
  \ calmly and sat on the edge, feet dangling above the flowing chaos, firmly holding\
  \ on to the bridge with her delicate hands  \u201CYou can stay on the safe side\
  \ if you want\u201D\nI sat down looking towards the passing trains, having her by\
  \ my side.\n\u201CWhat do you think it\u2019s saying? Watching us every day, trying\
  \ not to slip and fall\u201D she asked.\n\u201CHe is warning us. On his last moments,\
  \ he hopes we will listen to him\u201D\nShe smiled, obviously satisfied with my\
  \ answer. \u201CInstead we keep locking padlocks on already burdened bridges\u201D\
  \ she added.\n\u201CAre you the spirit of the city?\u201D I finally pronounced my\
  \ guess, turning my head to see her reaction. She laughed but answered fast:\n\u201C\
  That would mean you are falling in love with the city, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201D \n\
  I am sure I blushed.\nI figured that it was probably coming true: Cologne has enthralled\
  \ me.\n She moved closer to me, her face almost touching mine, only the metal fence\
  \ between us.\n\u201CWhy do people desire to expect the unexpected in life?\u201D\
  \n\u201CTo pretend they are ready for the unfortunate\u201D The hanging locks jingled\
  \ ominously with each passing train.\n\u201CThey shouldn\u2019t. The unexpected\
  \ carries a sweet release\u201D she said, her hands loosening their grip on the\
  \ edge of the bridge.\nPerhaps as an attempt to unburden it."
