Text: "Ever had a trip that isn\u2019t going as planned? You are not getting the experience\
  \ you anticipated or paid for?\_I encountered this three days into my Amazon jungle\
  \ trip when the guide left me to spend the remainder of my time at the lodge. I\
  \ thought 'This\_sucks. I spent all this money and come all this way to sit in a\
  \ lodge?!'.\_I was irritated. I moved to an angry pity party. My irritation was\
  \ initially directed at the guide, but then I realized I was angry at myself for\
  \ not using my voice. My emotions were getting the better of me, and they could\
  \ have easily cast a shadow on that leg of the trip as well as the other legs. I\
  \ decided to take a deep breath, find my voice, and went in search of the guide.\n\
  \nOff we went into the jungle, armed with flashlights as the light was quickly disappearing.\
  \ Part way through the trek we came across a spider - the infamous deadly and aggressive\
  \ wandering spider. As the name suggests unlike other spiders who stay on their\
  \ web or within a certain territory, this one wanders. My inner therapist\u2019\
  s efforts to calm me by telling me 'it is safe as long as it stays in its space\
  \ and you in yours' did not apply to this beast. To demonstrate the aggressiveness\
  \ of the spider to the solo tourist standing nervously next to him, the guide poked\
  \ the it with a stick. The spider was not amused by this and I was left with visions\
  \ of a spider with a vendetta wandering after us.\n\nMoving forward, we came to\
  \ a section of the trail that seemed impassable, with pools of water and fallen\
  \ trees. Spotting a small snake in the water further confirmed my thoughts on the\
  \ impassibility of the trail. I stupidly asked whether the snake was dangerous,\
  \ and was briefly comforted by the guide\u2019s response of \"Not at that size.\
  \ But as an adult, that is another story\". But my mind then raced to 'where are\
  \ the snakes parents? Are they angry?' and  'Great. I now have to balance on logs\
  \ and trudge through water, while looking over my shoulder for the angry wandering\
  \ spider, the parents of the snake and whatever else we have irritated on this nocturnal\
  \ trek'.\_\n\nI wanted to avoid it or turn around, but like most other difficult\
  \ things in life there is no avoiding, and the only option is to go through it.\
  \ I decided to take a deep breath, find my strength and continue forward. In deciding\
  \ find my voice, and to push forward I had been taken to the edge of my fears, but\
  \ in doing so I saw the beauty and danger of the jungle. I got the jungle experience\
  \ I wanted."
