Text: "THE ETERNAL JOURNEY\n\n\nShafts of sunbeams shine through the roof of an open\
  \ wooden hut. Gingerly I enter the hut to see a winsome little girl dressed in a\
  \ pink frock. \nA busy carpenter bee digs up a home on a wooden roof beam. Specks\
  \ of woody construction debris falls through the sunlit shafts into the little ballerina\u2019\
  s arena.\nShe\u2019s wonderstruck.\nIt feels like raining confetti to her. She gently\
  \ raises and swirls, like a Sufi in trance, dancing to the rhythm of life.\nOh the\
  \ wonder in her eyes!\n\nInadvertently I sneeze and spoil the moment. She looks\
  \ at me and runs to her mother\u2019s lap. All snuggled up, she investigates me\
  \ with a beckoning gaze. I pace myself reassuringly to her. I am met with a shy\
  \ pinky finger handshake. \n A strong breeze makes its way through the forest. Leaves\
  \ sway and applaud the beauty of the moment. Over the course of the day, shadows\
  \ lengthen, we grow closer.\n\nAs night sets in, I feel the conquest of a bout of\
  \ cold in my body. I try my hand at lighting up a fire to heat water for a gargle.\
  \ The flicker of the growing flame informs me of an onlooker close by. The baby\u2019\
  s mother comes close and asks,\n\n\u2018How do you feel now?\u2019\n\nLooking at\
  \ the baby I reply, \n\u2018With her warm presence , my cold won\u2019t last long.\u2019\
  \n\n\u2018Back in France, this is pretty much like a summer evening!\u2019 \n\n\u2018\
  For a forest in South India, this is quite a cold winter my friend.\u2019\n\nShe\
  \ and I look at the baby dotingly. The baby tries to put little pieces of kindling\
  \ inside the camp fire.\n\u2018Comme Ca?\u2019 she asks.\nWe nod smilingly.\n\n\
  While fireflies flirt in pitch darkness, the Jungle is abuzz with grapevine. With\
  \ my cup of hot salt water I find a spot under the open canopy. As I gargle to relieve\
  \ my cold, the funny noise of bubbling water in my throat grabs the baby\u2019s\
  \ attention. She follows the sound and finds me behind a thin outgrowth. I take\
  \ her in my lap, take a sip of water and turn my head up to gargle again. She just\
  \ can\u2019t stop giggling.\nAnd I do it again. Sip and look up.\nShe looks up too.\n\
  And I find her,\nWonderstruck. Again.\n\nAs my eyes open up beyond the banal, I\
  \ finally see what she sees.\nA breathtaking array of stars, falling on us, slowly,\n\
  Just like the wooden dust from the carpenter bees, falling through the sunlit shaft.\n\
  \nA dizzying cascade of stars,\nUnfurling,\nFalling from a height beyond,\nPromising\
  \ to never arrive.\n\nShe can\u2019t look away. And I dare not sneeze.\n\nI realise\
  \ how far into the Jungle I had to travel to understand the extent,\nof our eternal\
  \ cosmic journey."
