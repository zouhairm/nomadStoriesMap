Text: "\u201CWe\u2019re here,\u201D says the lovely older lady as she washes down\
  \ the pizza she ordered from the flight attendant with a nice refreshing glass of\
  \ red wine. \n\nAt this moment, I lost my independent self, the part of me who had\
  \ to be strong, who could never show emotion. I let the overwhelming amount of tears\
  \ gently stream down my face. Not one. Not two. But three tears came flying out\
  \ of my eye sockets and making their way onto my sleeve.\n\nOkay, but why was I\
  \ crying? \n\nWhen you're in the air soaring high above the city, you\u2019re given\
  \ a chance to shine a different perspective on what you\u2019ve grown up seeing.\
  \ You take a glance out the window and see your home transformed into something\
  \ larger than your 60 sq foot apartment. You see a community, you see something\
  \ that reminds you of home. \n\nI hated my life, I always felt bad for myself and\
  \ couldn\u2019t wait for the time I turned 18 so I could leave my small town in\
  \ Southwestern Ontario. It was my dream, the one I never thought would die. With\
  \ those intentions in mind, I did the unspeakable. I booked a one-way ticket to\
  \ the other side of the world. I had hoped to live a glorious lifestyle, to be someone\
  \ who knew what she wanted and someone who could conquer whatever came in her way.\
  \ This girl I had dreamed about was a boss lady. She never said the word \u201C\
  no\u201D when it came to her deciding the next step in her miraculous life, she\
  \ never thought twice about something she did in the past, and she lived her life\
  \ to the fullest extent knowing that it could end at any time. \n\nI was still chasing\
  \ that dream when I was on the other side of the world. I was running to find myself,\
  \ I was talking to hear myself and I was breathing to know I was still alive. Deep\
  \ down I knew I had to keep moving, I had to be in a different state of mind than\
  \ I ever was before. Then it hit me. Like a baseball off the forehead. You\u2019\
  ve always been the boss lady. If you can dream it, and see yourself acting like\
  \ a boss lady, then you\u2019re already there. It isn\u2019t a matter of finding\
  \ yourself, It\u2019s a matter of knowing yourself. I was transformed. I became\
  \ the women I\u2019ve always wanted to be. A short 6-week trip around the world\
  \ allowed me to understand the true power of my thoughts and allowed me to unleash\
  \ the boss lady of my dreams. That was why I was crying. I had made the best and\
  \ yet simple change to my life. To live in the moment and to shine upon what it\
  \ was I wanted my life to look like. I became the best boss lady I could ever dream\
  \ of becoming."
