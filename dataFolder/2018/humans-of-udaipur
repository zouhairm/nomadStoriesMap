Text: "Scattered around Lake Pichola, in the heart of Udaipur is a network of hundreds\
  \ of tiny shops that are treasure troves of the most incredible merchandise I've\
  \ ever seen. Walking through these winding bazaars, I thought to myself about how\
  \ being a south Indian traveller in Rajasthan, I felt dominantly hit by the 'middle\
  \ child syndrome'. I didn't know enough Hindi to dabble in small talk or to bargain\
  \ right, nor was I foreign, for the vendors to take interest in me and the 'big\
  \ bucks' in my wallet. Thus, shying away from shopping or any interaction for that\
  \ matter, I reluctantly walked past the tarnished Afghani silver trinkets and the\
  \ embroidered jackets, when out of nowhere, clumps of dirt rained over my head.\
  \ I looked up, yelling an expletive when an aged man wearing a French beret and\
  \ a trench coat came scurrying down his stairs, broom in hand, apologizing profusely.\
  \ I wanted to be annoyed, but he seemed so honestly sorry, that I gave in. He reeled\
  \ me into his store, to make it up to me, and I hesitantly followed. He dusted a\
  \ little stool, sat me down and began pulling out silks from every rack, with such\
  \ excitement. Maroon, orange, indigo, you name it. 'Happy price, just for you madam!',\
  \ he squealed. In his broken English, he told me about the time Roger Moore visited\
  \ his shop whilst shooting Octopussy back in the 1980's. He even showed me a photograph\
  \ of his younger self, seeming so proud and enthused. Call it a marketing gimmick,\
  \ but I felt genuineness in the man. I wanted him to go on about how he zoomed through\
  \ the market in a rickshaw, squashing lemons and chillies under the tyres, during\
  \ the shooting a chase sequence for Octopussy. I left his store, with a bagful of\
  \ clothes and a significant change in the way I looked at the people around me.\
  \ I confidently walked into a miniature painting shop and chatted with the owner\
  \ for a good hour on the Biennale, his orange-dyed hair and his family. Mr Gothwal,\
  \ who was just figuring his way around Instagram let me leave only after I accepted\
  \ his 'friend request'. Perhaps it was just me all this long, alienating myself,\
  \ blaming it on the people. I remember walking back to my hotel that night, amidst\
  \ the dim city lights, confidently, not gripping the handles of my handbag, not\
  \ looking behind my shoulders every minute. At Rajasthan, I witnessed the most regal\
  \ palatial structures, so much culture and colour, but I\u2019d never trade them\
  \ for a visit to the small town of Udaipur. Just for the charm of their people."
