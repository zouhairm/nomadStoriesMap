Text: "It was a planned journey. I was in Praia with Teresa after our flight from\
  \ Lisbon. We agree to do a volunteer program with turtles in Cape Verde for two\
  \ weeks. It was a decision of a life time. The best two weeks of our lives. We learn\
  \ how to know that a turtle is arriving the beach, a dark point in the foam! We\
  \ learn how to live in a house with so many cockroaches, without piped water, without\
  \ a door! But we also have learned again how to live in the street with our neighbors\
  \ and their kids playing some childhood games. These kids hughed us everynight before\
  \ we went to the beach helping to protect turtles. But my story started with a magic\
  \ ride to Maio. We have two choices to get Maio, a flight of 20minutes or a fishermen\
  \ boat ride of 3hours till there. Despite being alerted not to do it, we have done\
  \ it, thanks God. We went with our bags to Praia fishing port. A typical poor and\
  \ dangerous african port. And guess what? We deal with nice fishermen a ride to\
  \ Maio next hours. It was 3 unbelievable hours. Two europeans with 10/15 fishermen,\
  \ seated in the fishing nets, talking about the portuguese people, about my hometown\
  \ football club Acad\xE9mica de Coimbra, raining a lot for one hour and hugging\
  \ my beautiful Teresa. Everything went well and we arrived Maio as the Portuguese\
  \ arrived Cape Verde hundreds years ago with a magnificient rainbow that we will\
  \ never forget in Porto Ingles, Maio\u2019s capital."
