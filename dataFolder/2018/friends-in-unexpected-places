Text: It was your typical Tuesday morning in July in Cairo. Sunny, warm and sticky.
  I was in the middle of my daily shift at the emergency department in one of the
  main hospitals of the city. As a exchange student, I didn't have much responsibility,
  not to say none. My routine consisted of finding a new doctor every day who would
  let me shadow them for the rest of their shift. The emergency department was crowded,
  as usual. There was not much space, neither for patients nor for doctors. There
  was just a narrow long corridor with small, improvised consultation rooms on one
  of its sides. The doctors working there would rotate so often I had to introduce
  myself pretty much every other day, to the amusement of the nurses. Keeping up with
  them and their job proved to be a hard task. On the one hand, my Arabic was limited
  to counting up to five; on the other hand, the sheer amount of cases they had to
  face on a daily basis was too high for them to be able to afford to waste precious
  time on explaining everything to me. That particular day, however, luck seemed to
  be on my side. I had just returned to the main desk when a young surgeon showed
  up. He looked at me with interest. He had obviously noted how out of place I was.
  Be it out of pity or out of pure kindness, he offered to let me watch one of his
  surgeries the next day. At that moment, I was too happy to realize a friendship
  for a lifetime had just been born. Not only did he show me the inner workings of
  the operating theather, but he also showed me another side of Cairo, less touristic,
  more authentic. I will never forget his mom's masa'a.
