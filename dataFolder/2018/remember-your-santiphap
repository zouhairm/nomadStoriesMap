Text: "\u201CHello! Tuk tuk? Killing Field? Where you from?\u201D We woke to countless\
  \ tuk tuks, each one unique in design, lining the crowded, dusty streets of sunny\
  \ Phnom Penh. It was an ordinary day for the steadfast locals of Cambodia, but it\
  \ would prove differently for us.\n\nWe ventured through the chaotic city center\
  \ into a quieter section of town. As we discussed some ideas for the day, we walked\
  \ by a lone tuk tuk driver. This time, we were greeted with a rare silence. Intrigued,\
  \ we looked back to find him smiling wide and waving to us.\n\n\u201CHow are you\
  \ today?\u201D He spoke softly, and carried a tattered book in his hands. He was\
  \ an unassuming middle-aged man of small frame. A sun-bleached baseball cap, too\
  \ big to fit his head, rested atop his ears. He offered to take us to the Killing\
  \ Fields for a very reasonable price. His heartwarming demeanor made us happy to\
  \ oblige.\n\nOur new friend drove us southbound on a pleasant, albeit bumpy ride\
  \ through a few quiet rural villages out to the dreaded Killing Fields of Choeung\
  \ Ek. We asked him, \u201Cwill we need to find a ride back?\u201D He laughed and\
  \ replied, \u201CNo, no, no. I will be waiting here for you!\u201D He put his feet\
  \ up and opened his book.\n\nWe walked grudgingly toward the Killing Fields, a place\
  \ so abominable it forced us to reconsider its place on our itineraries. However,\
  \ it is a place so undeniably important to human history that we were pulled inexorably\
  \ through its oppressive gates.\n\nFor over an hour we toured the sites in the blistering\
  \ heat, and the horror was palpable. We cried, and we paid our respects to the estimated\
  \ three million Cambodians killed by the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s. Heartbroken,\
  \ we were left wondering how we would ever reorient ourselves back to reality.\n\
  \nWhen we found our driver, he was smiling and waving to us again. In his lap were\
  \ cold bottles of water he had gotten for us. He asked about our experience. We\
  \ tried to rally our emotions in order to come up with a coherent response to such\
  \ a seemingly basic question. We were just starting to make ground when our driver\
  \ floored us.\n\n\u201CThe Khmer Rouge killed my whole family. My sister and I are\
  \ the only ones who survived.\u201D\n\nSantiphap, our driver went on to tell us,\
  \ is the Khmer word for \u201Cpeace.\u201D Much of the meaning gets lost in translation,\
  \ however. Santiphap also encompasses our incredible resilience and our unwavering\
  \ sense of hope in the face of unthinkable tragedy. It represents the power that\
  \ lies in the perspectives we choose to hold. I wish him well."
