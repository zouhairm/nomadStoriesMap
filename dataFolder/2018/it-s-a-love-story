Text: "I stood by the door waiting for the bus to halt. He was standing there as promised,\
  \ wearing the biggest smile. I observed him quickly through the tinted glass before\
  \ the door opened, he sure looked better than his display picture on Whatsapp. I\
  \ was so happy he had offered to come pick me. I had four bags, two hands, and I\
  \ surely couldn't afford a taxi.\n\n\"Ciao Stefano!\" I drew him into my arms, landing\
  \ two loud kisses on both cheeks. \"Ciao, how was your flight?\"  he asked. \"Stressful!\
  \ Thanks for coming, never knew good landlords still existed\" I declared. \"I'm\
  \ not your landlord, I am your flatmate. I help the landlord because she doesn\u2019\
  t speak English.\" With that, he picked up the last luggage from the bus and led\
  \ the way to his car. \nIn-between conversations, he said \"Santa Rosalia Festival\
  \ is tomorrow. Come with me, you would love it\u201D.\n \nStefano was right. It\
  \ was a beautiful frenzy, with a lot of shows all at once. This evening of July\
  \ 14th looked colourful and promising. Women wore crowns of flower, symbolic of\
  \ Santa Rosalia. Acrobatic dancers descended from the sky, twirling glamorously\
  \ on circle metal rings in their white tulle, complementing the \"Ave Maria\" song\
  \ pouring loudly from the speakers.\n\nBeneath the arc of Porta Nuova, the enormous\
  \ white wooden ship mounted with 30 meters high sculpture of Santa Rosalia wearing\
  \ a crown of flowers and holding a bouquet docked. \"This is is the most important\
  \ event of the day, the journey of the ship from Porta Nuova to Porta Felice\u201D\
  \ Stefano beamed with excitement. \n\nTen men held ropes fastened to the ship, ready\
  \ to start the journey. We joined the crowd that slowly proceeded behind the ship.\
  \ Stefano leaned close to my left ear \u201CSanta Rosalia is the Saint Patron of\
  \ Palermo. She lived in a cave by herself to devote her life to prayer. Her bones\
  \ were discovered a century later by a man who wanted to commit suicide. She stopped\
  \ him, told him to parade her bones through the city and she will heal Palermo of\
  \ the afflictions. Now her bones are paraded yearly.\"\n\nHalfway through the journey,\
  \ the mayor went on the ship and yelled through a megaphone, \u201CViva Palermo!\u201D\
  , the crowd replied with a deafening chorus \u201Ce Santa Rosalia!\u201D\n\nThe\
  \ fanfare continued till the ship safely arrived at Porta Felicia. Far above the\
  \ harbour, fireworks exploded continuously. I watched happily, leaning my head against\
  \ Stefano's shoulder. For the first time, since I made the decision to come to Palermo\
  \ for my internship, I knew I would be fine."
