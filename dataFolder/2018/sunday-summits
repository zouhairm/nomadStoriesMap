Text: "I was on my way back from an unsuccessful negotiation with a woman at the raft\
  \ stand at Li-River a few kilometers away from Yangshuo. It was my second try to\
  \ enjoy this Sunday. The first one was to hike a path down Li-River with two crossings\
  \ on a boat. Anyway, the path was closed and I had to go back by bus. I decided\
  \ to try my luck with one of those rafts adorned with colorful umbrellas, whose\
  \ starting point was a village I was hiking from the day before. It is a very mainstream\
  \ but also picturesque tour. Now I was walking back to the busstop, tears in my\
  \ eyes because the price was too high (for the blonde, supposed rich girl), it rained\
  \ the whole week and I had to stay all alone in a six bed hostel dorm. Back at the\
  \ busstop, I caught a bus to Yangshuo a few minutes later. Yangshuo is famous for\
  \ its\u2019 karst mountains that stand quirky, ubiquitous in the landscape. As I\
  \ watched those sine-wave-formed rocks in passing, I decided to climb one of those.\
  \ I researched my guide and prompt found one mountain I could climb. My mood just\
  \ became better as my enthusiasm was broken by the woman at the reception in my\
  \ hostel, who told me that nowadays it was prohibited to climb that mountain\u2013\
  without discoverable reason. But\u2013she meant confidently\u2013there was another\
  \ one, not far away from the hostel. Thank god, my Sunday was rescued. But\u2013\
  she continued\u2013you could not climb up the whole mountain because it was prohibited\
  \ to do that. Whatever, I left the hostel, found my path and walked and then there\
  \ was the gate with a sign \"Passage prohibited, dangerous\". It looked very old\
  \ and the gate was half open, but my conscience told me not to pass. While I was\
  \ standing there, thinking if I should do it or not, came a couple from above through\
  \ the gate and greeted me kindly, while following their walk. My inner devil triumphed\
  \ and I continued my hike. For around ten minutes everything was fine but then there\
  \ was the next gate\u2013even more alarming signs, like \"Danger of life\". This\
  \ time the door was closed. I stood in front of it and wondered what to do now.\
  \ This time my thoughts were interrupted by a middle-aged Chinese man, who opened\
  \ the door and told me to pay ten yuan for a bottle of water and the best view in\
  \ town. I was so happy to achieve one goal on this rainy bad-luck-Sunday, that I\
  \ gave him 20 instead of ten yuan and walked straight through the mans\u2019 flat,\
  \ which was a former TV tower and reached the top of the mountain in less than two\
  \ minutes to find a stunning Sunday-view."
