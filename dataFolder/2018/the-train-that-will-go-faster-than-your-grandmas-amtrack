Text: "Getting on a train and riding the rails, in the vast expanses of Canada.  The\
  \ water might be better. To drink.  The oil might be harder to process, but they\
  \ ship a lot of it down to the States.  The Coffee may be cheaper. What?  Your right,\
  \ coffee isn't cheaper.  The people may be neater.  Like How?  Well, they are more\
  \ level headed than Americans.  And they actually say \"Eh\" I walked by the train\
  \ station once in Winnipeg and I watched a Netflix documentary about some rock and\
  \ roll bands that went on a tour of Canada and took the train.  See there's two\
  \ extreme ends to Canada and also a midwest which is coincidentally just like the\
  \ midwest, but it's Canadian, so its a little different.  \n They had more trains\
  \ in the United States, some years ago, like in the 1940's.  Some of them still\
  \ exist, but they survive only as remnants for a few fine folk that have time to\
  \ dilly dally on European inspired trains, with decor that any full bodied ox of\
  \ an American would clumsily smash when he jumps up from his Attention disorder\
  \ and has to go look out a window, and be really annoying.  Well, we don't get out\
  \ much.  This is America you have to keep an eye on your surroundings.  \nThe few\
  \ Central American trains that exist, were few and far between, from the documentaries\
  \ I've seen on them.  They would mainly be supply trains, and passengers.  Old trains\
  \ from America that they kept up and sold to Central American countries.  The only\
  \ train that compares to anything in Mexico is in Northern Mexico and it stretches\
  \ along some stunning pieces of land, and whisks you to hotels and paradise lodgings.\
  \  It's a three day trip and you need to make plans after that.  Then in South America\
  \ if you have the right connections, there is old cargo trains from America that\
  \ go thorough the Andes mountains, puffing along.  Brutally built tanks from the\
  \ 40s, but this chunk of land isn't very train friendly.  Buses are good for the\
  \ south land of America, or if you have more money the plane is fast, but it's sort\
  \ of a sterile traveling experience, if you want to get more experienced.  \n  Not\
  \ sure if it was fictional or not but there was a famous Norwegian writer named\
  \ Knut Hamnsun.  He came to Minnesota in the 1950's to see what his people were\
  \ up to, he had a few odd jobs and on the back of one of his books he said he contracted\
  \ Tuberculosis and rode a top a train from Chicago to New Your with his mouth open\
  \ and cured it.  Not sure how he got back to Europe.  He didn't say."
