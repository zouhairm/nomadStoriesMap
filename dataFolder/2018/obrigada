Text: "Watching the sun caress each terracotta roof in a final farewell to the day\
  \ I stood at the top of the Elevador de Santa Justa in Lisbon, Portugal and the\
  \ light, soft and gentle, created a warming sensation that reverberated through\
  \ my body. I felt not the heat of the sun but a warmth for the city, an affection.\
  \ When a complete stranger outstretched the shelter of their umbrella to me I felt\
  \ fate had intervened. Seeing the city at night brought it alive in a different\
  \ way than what is witnessed during the day. Artists stood under balconies in crowded\
  \ corners, painting, singing, playing guitar and dancing passionately to the combined\
  \ music of the city. Scents and conversations floated out of the many restaurants\
  \ and bars lining the roads; cinnamon spice, custard, wine, spirits, pastries, hot\
  \ meals, the clinking of glasses and feverish chatter that made no sense to my ears\
  \ but altogether created a tantalising atmosphere of liveliness and passion. There\
  \ is no competition for space just a unified sense of belonging and being amongst\
  \ the juxtaposition, that felt very personal to me, of the temporary and the eternal.\
  \ The rain bounced off the blue, pink and yellow painted buildings and sprang before\
  \ us like glistening diamonds or stars, bursting and dispersing as it hit the cobbled\
  \ streets, and everything felt like magic. This stranger was called Andre and with\
  \ a typical European elegance he lead me with confidence down many spiralling streets\
  \ all the while speaking freely from his soul about life, beauty, love, pain and\
  \ hope. We walked alleyways with walls adorned with flowers and vines while he spoke\
  \ of how greatly he cared for his people, both African and Portuguese, and the unique\
  \ challenges (and love) of finding yourself belonging between two cultures. He asked\
  \ many personal questions of me and we spoke with an openness that can be found\
  \ so easily when two people know they will likely never see each other again and\
  \ that the night is of no consequence. Without realising it the night bled into\
  \ the next day and we found ourselves standing beside one another at three in the\
  \ morning overlooking the glistening light of the moon on the ocean waves, listening\
  \ to the gentle rock of the boats. In this moment of silence between us I felt that\
  \ earlier warmth again and I whispered under my breath \u2018obrigada\u2019. The\
  \ only word I knew in Portugese because it was reminiscent of the word \u2018abracadabra\u2019\
  . It felt like a magical incantation as it left my mouth. It meant \u2018Thank You\u2019\
  ."
