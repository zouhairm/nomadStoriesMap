Text: "Accessibility plays the most important role for disabled travelers, and it\
  \ can be a critical factor in order to choose a destination or not. This if you\
  \ are a typical person, who listens to others without any doubt and research. It\
  \ is a different story if you are a \u201Crebel\u201D. \n\nLiving in Greece, where\
  \ accessibility is not very good, you listen often that in the neighboring Turkey\
  \ the situation is much worse and that you don\u2019t have any chances to survive\
  \ a visit there if you use a wheelchair, like me. The thing is that I don\u2019\
  t listen to others when it comes to travel, as I have learned that you have to live\
  \ an experience yourself in order to judge it. Stories are nice, but not necessarily\
  \ close to reality. Not because people lie, but because everyone\u2019s view and\
  \ perceptions are different. Even accessibility, which is supposed to be specific,\
  \ can sometimes be not, for various reasons. \n\nI wanted, also, so much to visit\
  \ Turkey, and especially Istanbul. Not only it is the country of my father, but\
  \ is a must-visit destination for every traveler. Moreover, it is a very special\
  \ place for Greeks, because of historical reasons, and even though I\u2019m not\
  \ from Greece, it is still the country I was born and live, so I really wanted to\
  \ do this trip. Last but not least, I wanted to prove to everyone, and especially\
  \ to my disabled friends, that it is doable and that they should do this trip too.\
  \ So it was decided, I was going to visit Istanbul!\n\nI found a friend who would\
  \ like to come with me as an assistant, I did a small research on city\u2019s accessibility\
  \ and I booked the tickets. I spent the next days by planning and arranging everything\
  \ until the last moment.\n\nAs for the trip itself, it began with the worst possible\
  \ way, as I arrived to the hotel and realized it was not accessible (as it stated\
  \ on its website). I lost almost all the first day to find another. And however\
  \ it was a very stressful day, in the end I managed to find a small local accessible\
  \ hotel, in a better price and location, and most importantly with great people.\
  \ \n\nAfter that, I had some of the best days of my life, which is the last thing\
  \ I expected after that stressful first day and everything my friends said before\
  \ the trip. Istanbul is a wonderful city, with very friendly and helpful people,\
  \ giving me many unforgettable experiences. What I learned, is that you should not\
  \ be afraid to be adventurous, get out of your comfort zone and discover the world\
  \ yourself. Istanbul is a great place to start!"
