Text: "It was rather crowded when I stepped out of the Bali airport but managed to\
  \ find my name on a placard held by a widely-smiling local man. I did not know in\
  \ that moment, when I stepped into his vehicle, that he was going to be more than\
  \ just a driver to me. He eventually went on to become a guide, a translator and\
  \ above all, an ally. \nHe went by the name Tarzan and spoke English well. This\
  \ was what essentially drew me towards him, and admittedly, also the fact that he\
  \ was a surfer. I find men who are into adventure sports very interesting. Tarzie,\
  \ as he asked me to call him, treated me very well. He helped with deals at so many\
  \ of the places on my list of places-to-go-to and helped streamline my itinerary\
  \ efficiently too. \nIn the one week I spent on the island, through his eyes, I\
  \ understood a lot about Balinese culture and people. Tarziee explained his family\
  \ set up to me and also shared the love story of his marriage. He was surprised\
  \ when I told him that I was unmarried at my age and was rather taken aback by how\
  \ I hadn\u2019t succumbed to parental pressures back home to get married sooner.\
  \ He also innocently asked me in simple and straightforward English, what I was\
  \ waiting for. I remember whispering to myself, \u201Cprince charming\u201D.\nHe\
  \ was always dressed in traditional Balinese attire - a sort of black \u2018lungi\u2019\
  \ with a silk colourful or golden border and a black t-shirt. He also wore a head\
  \ gear of the same print and material. I remember falling in love with the head\
  \ gear instantly and wanting to buy one for myself.\nOn one of our trips around\
  \ the city, he randomly stopped on the roadside to buy me a Balinese street \u201C\
  cake\u201D. A sort of steamed, green cake that I did not like. He, on the other\
  \ hand, devoured a whole plate of this local delicacy.\nOur most interesting exchange\
  \ was undoubtedly that of our languages. He used to have a hard time remembering\
  \ my name and in order to avoid the embarrassment of asking me over and over he\
  \ devised a technique to remember it. He told me that the first part of my name\
  \ - Rem - means stop or break in Indonesian and from then on never forgot my name.\
  \ As a bonus, I got to learn what my name means in Indonesian too!\nYears later,\
  \ my mind sometimes wanders off to remember Tarzan fondly. At a time when sincerity\
  \ is a hard trait to come by, I find myself fortunate to have met him and to have\
  \ had him at my service, in as huge a tourist destination as Bali. He is a part\
  \ of the beautiful memories I created in an equally beautiful place."
