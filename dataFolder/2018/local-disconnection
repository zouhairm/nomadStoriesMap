Text: "Swaziland is a largely unknown gem, and I\u2019m thankful that I discovered\
  \ it.\nA stroke of luck landed me at the horse riding center at a time I was not\
  \ booked in at, and I ended up leaving my group and walking back to our villa alone.\
  \ \nIt was the best mistake I could have made in my life.\nThe trails offer a solitude\
  \ that is not be found in float tanks, meditation classes, or anything in my home\
  \ of modern Australia. Alone time can be unattainable and a true disconnection is\
  \ near impossible.\nIt was me and Africa.\nThe divinity of the world was inescapable.\
  \ Hundreds of sounds of the African plains emerged around me. I spotted Zebras,\
  \ Impalas, and the sun kissed me in a way that said, \u2018Welcome home.\u2019\n\
  I walked past a stream, down hills, around grass taller than me. I floated past\
  \ flowers and a red earth that had birthed this beauty I was being blessed with.\n\
  The best connection you feel is when you\u2019re disconnected.\nThe next day, I\
  \ wandered off again.\nThe trail was familiar, and the trees greeted me once again\
  \ with their presence.\nAlong the trail\u2026\nDown the hill\u2026\nAnd around the\
  \ stream \u2013 \nWilder beast.\n7 wilder beast.\nAnd me. \nI stopped. My heart\
  \ beat a little faster. \nThey stopped and reared their heads. \nAnd they stared.\n\
  I was waiting for them to take their eyes off of me and go about their business\
  \ of eating grass.\nBut they stared.\nAnd I side stepped behind a tall grass patch.\n\
  As soon as I did it, I realised how fruitless it would be. \nI stepped back out\
  \ onto the trail and in plain view.\nWould they mind their business if I continued\
  \ on the trail? Or was the trail too close to them? Would they really see me and\
  \ my pink backpack as a threat?\nThey started snorting.\nI could die out here and\
  \ no one would know my last moments.\nI turned my back.\nI turned my back on the\
  \ 7 snorting wilder beasts with their eyes locked on me.\nAnd I walked, tentatively\
  \ slowly, back up the trail and onto the main road.\nI saw a dirt bike approaching\
  \ me from the opposite direction. It was the Afrikaans man who owned the horse riding\
  \ center. \u201CWhat are you doing out here? The trails over there!\u201D \nI retold\
  \ my story of how the wilder beast, and he laughed. \u201CThe vilderbest? They wouldn\u2019\
  t have bothered you, you could walk straight past them! I\u2019ll see you at the\
  \ villa now.\u201D\nThat evening after dinner, intrigued by this oasis, I walked\
  \ outside the grounds one last time. I didn\u2019t go far, but I still wanted to\
  \ be connected. Or, disconnected. \nI anchored myself and watched the sunset, and\
  \ it was the most connected I had ever felt."
