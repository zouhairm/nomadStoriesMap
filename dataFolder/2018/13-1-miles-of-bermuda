Text: "The alarm rang and reluctantly I silenced it and roused my girlfriend from\
  \ her sleep.\n\n\u201CIt\u2019s time\u201D \n\nShe responded by blinking one eye\
  \ lazily and then the other, as if blinking both at the same time risked pulling\
  \ her back to dreamy bliss. \n\nFully dressed we rushed outside, morning rays hadn\u2019\
  t yet greeted the tiny island and we were received by the same darkness we landed\
  \ in just the night before. All we had seen then was the totality of the night perpetuated\
  \ by the small amount of island lights. Bermuda was still unknown to us, the thought\
  \ was exhilarating. \n\nIn just a couple of hours we would be running through a\
  \ 13.1 mile stretch of Bermuda challenging ourselves, our fellow racers and the\
  \ road. This would be the longest run of my life and instead of our backyard we\
  \ decided to do it in style in Bermuda, I was terrified.\n\nOn the taxi ride over\
  \ the ensuing discussion had done nothing to allay my fears. \n\u201CDid you know\
  \ we are one of the hardest courses, the hills, it\u2019s the hills that do it.\
  \ Haha we look forward to cheering you guys on each year.\u201D The driver beamed.\n\
  \nI turned to my gf, no I didn\u2019t know that.\n\nBermuda lay before us untamed\
  \ and unexplored but my thoughts inevitably drifted back to the hills. We hadn\u2019\
  t interacted with too many Bermudians yet and I was at a loss to reconcile the nature\
  \ of the drivers comment. Already nerve racked I started to concoct scenarios and\
  \ images in my mind, everyone was out to get me, Bermuda would never let me finish\
  \ her race. \n\nI got mad.\n\nThe starter pistol fired and I burnt that anger like\
  \ coal, used it to push me forward. The problem is that\u2019s a dirty fuel, 11\
  \ miles in and I was beat, running hot instead of cool. I had to stop.\n\nWalking\
  \ now I could see the locals out on porches, hands waving excitedly shouting encouragement\
  \ while children jumped up and down and ran to hand us water. I could see the lush\
  \ green all around, plants basking in the sun churning out some of the cleanest\
  \ air I have ever tasted. The warmth of it all brought me back, this was Bermuda.\
  \ \n\nFeeling abashed and more than a little embarrassed I started again this time\
  \ all negative thoughts banished. Turning a corner the finish line came into view\
  \ along with a familiar sight. There was the taxi driver hooting and hollering \u201C\
  The hills\u201D as he beamed at us. \n\nVeering to the left of the finish we started\
  \ our second loop, it was a marathon after all. Familiar sights came into view but\
  \ at that moment it felt like I was seeing them for the first time."
