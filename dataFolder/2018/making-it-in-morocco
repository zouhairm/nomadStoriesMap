Text: "As a seasoned, well versed traveler I never really expect to fall victim to\
  \ scams. Ha! Marrakesh took me by the hand and showed me the way! Let\u2019s go\
  \ to Jemaa el-Fnaa, it is main The Square in Old Town and if you end up in Marrakesh\
  \ chances are you will and should end up here.  It is very much for the locals as\
  \ well as the tourist. The shops, the peddlers, entertainers, the smells the stalls\
  \ and the SCAMS. It is amazing!   Word to the wise, when trying to get across the\
  \ square, keep your eye on the prize and don\u2019t shake anyones hand. Do not let\
  \ anyone hand you anything.  Just keep your hands in your pockets!  My friend and\
  \ I were walking around the square on a nice sunny day towards our adopted tea caf\xE9\
  \ when a lady approached me about henna. I politely declined and turned to walk\
  \ away.  She caught my wrist in a death grip before I knew it and was already working\
  \ out a design on my hand.  Not to bothered I gave in and let her lead me back to\
  \ her chairs where another lady was waiting to \u201Cdry\u201D the henna.  Okay\
  \ folks, I know plenty about henna and spraying glitter over it does nothing but\
  \ make me look at you like you are insane.  This episode of talking and smiling\
  \ lasted less than 5 minutes and I asked \u201CHow much?\u201D,  \u201COh anything\
  \ from your heart!\u201D Well my heart was saying \u201CI don\u2019t mind paying\
  \  a few Euros for henna that I don't want.\u201D \u201CNO! GIVE US PAPER MONEY!\u201D\
  \ and they demanded that I pay them 400 dirham which equals 40 Euros.  Absolutely\
  \ not!  After some back and forth and many heated words  I ended up scraping the\
  \ henna off of my arm and flinging it to the ground. I paid her a few Euro and ran\
  \ off to find my friend enjoying himself at a juice stall. Ha, must be nice!  Seeing\
  \ as how my arm was smeared in henna and the stain was already setting the juice\
  \ seller did me a solid and helped me wash the caked up henna off with a couple\
  \ of buckets of water. Afterwards we made our way in the opposite direction only\
  \ to be confronted by a snake charmer who will put his snake over unwilling shoulders\
  \ and then expect you to pay him to take it off! The brightly colored water sellers\
  \ that want you to take a picture. for a price. There are smiling men with a trained\
  \ monkeys that  will shake your hand and in two seconds said monkey will have climbed\
  \ up your arm and sit on your head. GOODNESS! This is just the square, wait until\
  \ we get lost in the souks again! We finally make it to Caf\xE9 De France and order\
  \ our traditional mint tea.  Good times and it was just the beginning."
