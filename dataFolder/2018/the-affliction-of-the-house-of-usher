Text: "The suburbs of the city are over, no more glamourous family houses. The landscape\
  \ is way different now, small green patches are the only survivors from the invasion\
  \ of roads, train tracks, and roundabouts. I\u2019m arriving to the place where\
  \ I have to take the highway, just one hour at maximum legal speed and I\u2019ll\
  \ be home.  It\u2019s early, I see another way out that goes through the countryside\
  \ and I don\u2019t hesitate, there has to be a better place than this, a better\
  \ world.\n\nThis ancient road goes through the villages of this corner of the old\
  \ continent that have been ignored by the modern world, resulting in a atavistic\
  \ image of big old houses, with coats of arms on top of their doors, being conquered\
  \ by the patient and unstoppable vegetation. I see some old ladies sitting on the\
  \ side road selling veggies grown in their backyards. I need to refuel so I stop\
  \ and ask where I can find a petrol station. \u201CYou have one close to the factory,\
  \ take that shortcut\u201D, they say while dismantling the improvised road market.\
  \ It is almost sunset, everything will be empty soon.\n\nThe shortcut looks like\
  \ a tunnel. Old twisted trees shake their branches on top of you, making the road\
  \ look like a rabbit hole cutting through the forest. The sunset lights make strange\
  \ sparks in the middle of the fog and the ambient slowly becomes dark, and quiet,\
  \ so quiet. I see a clearing in the forest and, out from nowhere, a mansion, an\
  \ abandoned House of Usher. Windows closed, blocked door, and the roof being digested\
  \ by the trees. Behind the macabre mansion I can see, down in the bottom of the\
  \ valley, the petrol station and, by its side, a gigantic chimney, bigger than anything\
  \ I\u2019ve ever seen. A never ending column of grey smoke and the moon hidden behind\
  \ it.\n\nI get out of my car, take a leaf from the ground, it is grey and covered\
  \ in dust. I take a torch, light the walls of the mansion, they are varnished with\
  \ layers of pollution. This building seems sick rather than decaying. Whoever lived\
  \ here is gone forever, who would be mad enough to live and die in the middle of\
  \ a dust rain? \n\nPeople who travel are trying to discover new worlds, they try\
  \ to have a revelation about life. But trust me, you don\u2019t need to travel far\
  \ away to have a revelation. I had one on a unexpected night, at an unexpected clear\
  \ of a hill. My revelation was that the countryside wasn\u2019t dead, it was slaughtered\
  \ by the never ending needs of progress. Do not let ourselves be fooled, House of\
  \ Usher didn\u2019t fall, it was thrown down."
