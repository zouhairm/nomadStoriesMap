Text: "A farmer and his son sat down to eat after a hard morning\u2019s work on their\
  \ farm. The clouds travelled over a grey-blue sky. The light grass was dancing in\
  \ the wind. Mountains towered in the distance. The boy turned to his father.\n\u201C\
  Papa, what is beyond those mountains?\u201D, he asked.\nThe father turned to him\
  \ \u201CThere are many cities\u201D, he replied\n\u201CI want to go, can you take\
  \ me?\u201D, the boy said with bright eyes.\nThe father turned looked the boy in\
  \ the eyes,\n\u201CIf your father grounds wheat, then you will ground wheat\u201D\
  , a saying in the small village, one that means you will follow in your father\u2019\
  s footsteps.\n\nThe boy finished his sandwich and continued working with his papa.\
  \ He grew up with this responsibility of keeping his father\u2019s job. True to\
  \ himself, he did not desire this life but as he aged and had a family and a daughter\
  \ that he cherished, keeping his bond with the farm.\n\nThe girl grew up working\
  \ at the farm with her father, day by day. In the evenings she sat on the edge of\
  \ a wall in the village a village outdated from the modern world, the girl kicked\
  \ her legs against the brick. \u2018Isn\u2019t there more to this life?\u2019, she\
  \ thought.\n\nOne day the girl sat in the field, clouds littered across a grey sky,\
  \ eating lunch with her father.\nShe looked across to her father. \u201CPapa, what\
  \ is beyond those mountains?\u201D, she asked.\n\u201CThere are many cities\u201D\
  , he replied with a smile.\n\u201CI want to go, can you take me there?\u201D, She\
  \ responded with her bright eyes.\nA memory flashed back to the father, reminiscing\
  \ with his past, he knew what he needed to say. He stuttered to say the classic\
  \ village saying, but his heart wasn\u2019t whole. He knew what he had wished for\
  \ as a child and looked back at his daughter.\n\u201CMy dear, I have never been\
  \ there, I have worked to keep this family farm alive and I have kept in my shadows.\
  \ Step into the light and go, I will give you all I have\u201D, he instructed and\
  \ they both smiled at each other and finished their meal.\n\nThe next day he gave\
  \ her some money and she set off over the mountains, not knowing what to expect\
  \ but she was the first of her family to leave the village. The bus went into the\
  \ first city, and she could not take away her excited smile, it shone through. As\
  \ she explored this new world she made friends, took on adventures, climbing mountains,\
  \ overlooking landscapes and facing her fears. She worked and she travelled border\
  \ after border, she was happy and thought of her father often. She looked up into\
  \ the sky, a bright blue colour lit up in her eyes."
