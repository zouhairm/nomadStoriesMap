Text: "This place that I\u2019m in is called Bread and Chocolate \u2013 two foods\
  \ that are hard to get here. Here is the jungle of Auroville, an intentional community\
  \ established some 70 years ago near Pondicherry in the south of India. The bread\
  \ is sourdough, made from scratch. The chocolate is artisanal and dark, dark, dark.\
  \ The drinks come in jars, not glasses, sipped through metal straws to save the\
  \ environment. The furniture is polished wood and metal, and the floor is compressed\
  \ soil. In Auroville, everyone works according to their capacity. The people working\
  \ in this cafe are mainly white. When I look across the road to the fields, the\
  \ people working are mostly brown.\nIt is as I\u2019m pressing the filter down on\
  \ my french press coffee that I first hear her moan. She is Indian, dark, her skin\
  \ tells me she is from a lower caste, and she is sitting in the dirt near my table.\
  \ She holds her hand out to me and pleads for money. I shake my head no, and she\
  \ looks at me reproachfully. She moves to the side of the building and begins to\
  \ wail. When I look around I see that no one else is moving, except one young man\
  \ who half rises from his seat and, when he sees where the noise is coming from,\
  \ sits down again. I feel a rising panic. What is the etiquette here? I wonder.\
  \ All of a sudden I\u2019m obsessed with what people will think of me. I want to\
  \ be accepted, even if I never find out their names. Should I give money? Should\
  \ I continue to turn the other way? I keep thinking that maybe this lady is a Hindu\
  \ goddess come to test me, and I am rejecting her. Or maybe she is just a woman,\
  \ kneeling in the dirt, begging for twenty rupees to feed herself and her daughter.\n\
  \ In the cafe people continue to chat. There is a date happening next to me. My\
  \ phone pings and I have a message from a friend in England. I think about the classical\
  \ music of India and it\u2019s characteristic drone that hums under the raga, or\
  \ melody. I am astonished at how quickly I have assimilated the noise of this woman\
  \ wailing into my thoughts, so that I barely notice the drone of it. The waitress\
  \ laughs when I ask for it because she has seen me before. I watch her move away\
  \ and am struck by her earthy sexuality. She wears a red, crocheted, tassled scarf\
  \ in her hair. I wonder where she\u2019s from. I wonder if, perhaps, she could have\
  \ been the lady in the dirt, and for a brief second she is, I see her scrabbling\
  \ in the red rocks, her scarf stained brown, her hands scratched and reaching out\
  \ to me. Then I see myself turning away."
