Text: "I know the sea. The waves that push themselves out of their own infinity, slowly\
  \ and controlled. Shortly before they get pulled back to their origin. It is the\
  \ perfect place to unwind, to listen to the smooth rush of the water, to its slightly\
  \ arrhythmic beat when it hits the shore. The sea is metaphor for quietness, meditation\
  \ and inner peace.  I had known the ocean as a place of slowness, positiv lethargy.\
  \ That was before I reached Oz.\n\nWe were four people by car, heading from Sydney\
  \ to Cairns. A standard backpacker/tourist trip. I really cannot remember whether\
  \ we had great expectations - and if we did - which ones. Was it the parties along\
  \ our road? Maybe it was the wildlife, we were eager to explore. We waited for highlights\
  \ like kangaroos, koalas or my personal favorite, a wombat. We actually saw all\
  \ of them, right in this order: dead on the road, sleeping covered by Eucalyptus\
  \ in a zoo, sleeping in an underground hole sheltered by a window, also in a zoo.\
  \ No snakes, some spiders, a couple of lizards. Australia's wildlife is characterized\
  \ by diversity. So much diversity spread over a whole continent, that it is hardly\
  \ possible to experience it. One thing, though, is always there, does not move and\
  \ that is why our searching eyes often tend to ignore it. \n\nWe stopped at a beach\
  \ of which I unfortunately cannot recall the name. It must have been shortly after\
  \ Newcastle. We stepped down come-down wooden steps surrounded by the typical bushes.\
  \ The sand was pervaded by blue shades. It was a small bay. Yet, I had never seen\
  \ something as mighty. \n\nRemember the slow and controlled waves at the beginning\
  \ of this story? The quietness? The Peace? I sat down in the sand, captivated by\
  \ an image which would be one of the most impressive, memorable, eye-ear-brain-penetrating\
  \ scenes of my life. As the waves were building up, you could perceive something\
  \ strong, dynamic, something higher than yourself. Liters of water crashed against\
  \ the shore, a wet thunderstorm of terrifying beauty and unrestrained power.  There\
  \ was no impression of quietness anymore, no slowness, no lethargy. As it entered\
  \ my eyes, the whole scenario turned into an inner rush. For a couple of minutes,\
  \ I was isolated in a feeling, a mix of terror and fascination I was not able to\
  \ share with my companions. \n\nAs we left, there was an uneasy excitement driving\
  \ through my body. All of it, every single sensation I had in those few moments,\
  \ has burnt into my mind and left a remaining imprint in my soul."
