Text: "Everything here is soft. The air is soft. The sand leading down to the water\u2019\
  s edge is soft, giving way underneath my toes like icing. The crash of waves is\
  \ no \u2018crash\u2019 but a rolling rustle of water, consistent and soothing. This\
  \ place is humbly and gently beautiful.  \n\nI have crossed a wilderness of raw\
  \ trees to get here; white, bare, stripped wood reaching out like a giant\u2019\
  s grasping fingers, desperate for the touch of water. I\u2019ve scattered invisible\
  \ crabs and turned their world upside down for a split second. They wear shells\
  \ to match the sand and dart in direct bursts of stress. But I am here, finally.\
  \ Her fingers are soft and the water she pours over my feet is soft. This is the\
  \ touch I\u2019ve come for, and it nourishes immediately with its firm care. I lie\
  \ down and press my face away from the world and into the table, and let the woman\
  \ take over my body. She is responsible for my muscles. She moves them, leans on\
  \ them, scrapes them and hurts them. She is responsible for my skin. Prickling,\
  \ pressing and puncturing. I\u2019m not allowed to move, and I don\u2019t. We are\
  \ connected: one body to another. But there are no words, no misunderstandings and\
  \ no expectations. Together we focus on my sensations. Each terrible tug and each\
  \ smooth stroke releases a little more tension. Gradually my thoughts slow. Then,\
  \ even as they do, they speed up again. I\u2019m listening to the water. Slow heart\
  \ rate. I\u2019m hungry, thirsty. Did I eat the last yoghurt? Fast heart rate. I\
  \ think, feel, think, feel, in bursts \u2013 like those little crabs. \n\nA tap\
  \ on the shoulder: \u2018turn\u2019. A cloth is over my eyes while her hands go\
  \ deep into my hair and strong fingertips press on my skull, a mixture of uncomfortable\
  \ pressure and welcome relief. Her fingers are like roots trying to pry into my\
  \ thoughts. Can she see them? Can she feel them? I think I can feel her smiling.\
  \ Impossible to stop my mind from fretting about the lime juice I added to my roots\
  \ earlier that day \u2013 just a little squeeze to help with the natural bleaching\
  \ process. It makes me smell like a pancake and has given my already dry hair a\
  \ sticky, crispy consistency. Maybe that\u2019s why she\u2019s smiling, and she\u2019\
  ll have pancakes for supper now."
