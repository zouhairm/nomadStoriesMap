Text: "Rain fell. Thunder rolled. I thought:\n\n   It wasn\u2019t long ago, under\
  \ the shadow of the Rocky Mountains, that the journey was of question\u2014where\
  \ do I go from here? Another season of river \n   guiding was finished. It would\
  \ only take a month to begin dreaming of rivers. So, a decision came with little\
  \ thought and much impulse. Now, under the \n   Australian sun, I live. Guiding\
  \ a river named Tully.\n\nInside the leaking cab of a flatbed truck with rafts stacked\
  \ neatly in tow and sweating river guides at my shoulders we rolled through the\
  \ valley. Watching the wipers dash across the windscreen we passed banana farms\
  \ and soaked banana pickers. A stream of water fell onto my seat and lap with each\
  \ bounce of the suspension. There will be no avoidance from water today; the Tully\
  \ River is in flood.\n\nHigh-water often brings a sort of quietness upon nervous\
  \ guides. With little sound but of the engine I drifted into daydream:\n \n   A\
  \ few days ago, when rain began to accumulate upon the tablelands and then into\
  \ surrounding streams, the river began to rise. As flows surpassed \n   the commercial\
  \ cut-off; customers were sent home. First-year Tully guides, such as myself, were\
  \ to familiarize themselves with flows of such scale.\n\n   Two of three rafts had\
  \ flipped not long after setting out. A few kilometres further downstream we arrived\
  \ at the top of a rapid named Lookout\u2014which is \n   a series of standing swells\
  \ and hydraulics nearly a quarter mile long.\n\n   Upon entrance I noticed need\
  \ to be further towards river-right and that the boat was drifting sideways with\
  \ the current. Few seconds passed until \n   dropping parallel into a hydraulic.\
  \ Fewer seconds passed to realize the boat was upside down. Surfacing just downstream\
  \ of the bellied-up raft was \n   one opportunity to grab hold. I missed badly.\
  \ Turning to face what lay ahead I prepared for a beatering of heavy proportions.\
  \ Being tossed, dunked, \n   and helplessly shoved into more of the same by a force\
  \ that cares little of you is humbling. Sputtering for air and desperate to be rescued\
  \ the rapid \n   ended after what seemed an eternity.\n\nThe truck reached the put-in.\
  \ Rafts were unloaded. Lifejackets and paddles displayed. Customers would arrive\
  \ soon.\n\nMist rose as torrents of rain splashed atop us and into the green steaming\
  \ rainforest of Tropical North Queensland. The weather only adding towards the uncertainty.\
  \ I think:\n\n   Is it funny, to conceive such joy and wonder from a force that\
  \ feels nothing but indifference of you?"
