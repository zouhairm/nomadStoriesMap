Text: "The sensation that I felt when I arrived in Bogota was exciting and beautiful\
  \ just as it was landing in Cartagena. I had my doubts before going, but at the\
  \ end, there was almost an irresistible calling from within that I have to go and\
  \ I booked the ticket by surrendering to it. On a deeper level, I just knew that\
  \ it was worth it. The soul growth that I experienced for just two weeks was tumultuous.The\
  \ voice inside would not stop telling me that this is my place and I must return\
  \ and stay there for longer. I believe my spiritual being has almost reached death\
  \ before I left to travel.The Colombian culture, language, food and people has magically\
  \ turned me back to life. There is some kind of passionate flow which is in the\
  \ air and which I completely forgotten in the cold flatness of the Netherlands,\
  \ where I'm acquiring education,working and mostly alienating.Yet, my Bulgarian\
  \ spirit was calling back-being in Colombia made me feel like I'm home but anew,\
  \ different yet familiar.I couldn't ignore the inequality but I didn't let it disturb\
  \ me-on the contrary, it made me realize that happiness is in the simple things\
  \ such as observing the creations of \u2018Pachamama\u2019 (mother Earth).There's\
  \ an inexplicable charm in imperfection; and precious love in the painful histories,\
  \ and the smiles of the children. Innocence and imperfection awakened me.Some sort\
  \ of catharsis happens when one is going on a trip to save their soul. Inevitably,\
  \ there are limitations and conditionings that stop us from expressing our core\
  \ self. We want to belong to - a certain culture, an identity, a group. Yet, we\
  \ want to be individual, unique, someone and no one. It is great to see other individuals\
  \ on the road, going on their own journey, reaching their own truth, sharing their\
  \ stories, happiness and love. Seeing the beauty is not about ignoring the ugly-I\
  \ feel, it is about integrating the imperfect and flow with it as it is part of\
  \ life and it is part of us. I am not certain what is the hideous and what is the\
  \ so-called aesthetic but I am interested in the emotions, especially, the ones\
  \ we cling to so strongly. I reached another level of spiritual awareness by just\
  \ observing and feeling my environment and the spirit of this special place-Colombia,\
  \ beautiful islands, music, juices, murals. Most of all, passion. We've forgotten\
  \ to feel the passion for life and the appreciation of it. Therefore, we have forgotten\
  \ to be humans. The connection to nature is what can really transform the well-being\
  \ of a damaged heart and an over-loaded mind."
