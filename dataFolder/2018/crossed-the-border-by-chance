Text: "The end of my journey began when I was pulled over by Argentine police officers.\
  \ Peeking through the back window of my host brother\u2019s white 2003 Peugeot,\
  \ they immediately knew I was a foreigner. It may have been the red, white and blue\
  \ bandana I had tied around my head. All I wanted was to get a taste of Paraguay.\
  \ With chipa, an Argentine snack, in one hand, I put my head against the window\
  \ as muffled Spanish words were exchanged.  I knew some of the words, but by the\
  \ expressions on their faces, this was not going to end well. \n\nDiscrimination\
  \ is truly everywhere, yet the language barrier did not deter me from coming up\
  \ with a plan to get to Paraguay. I knew words could kill and words could give life,\
  \ they are either poison or fruit to choose from. I chose to feed fruit to those\
  \ officials to get what I wanted. At first I did not think it would work, but what\
  \ I could see on the other side of that border gave me life. This traumatic stop\
  \ was the last thing I expected. \n\nFour hours earlier we left the fluorescent\
  \ green house where I forgot my yerba mate and listened to Despacito to pass the\
  \ time. As we were riding along Ruta 34 from Argentina to Paraguay, the smell of\
  \ fumes clogged the air.  As I looked out the window, flames engulfed piles of garbage.\
  \ I was terrified every time we swerved into the other lane to pass a tractor-trailer\
  \ transporting goods from Brazil en route to Paraguay. The zig-zag writing in my\
  \ journal would remind me of our rollercoaster ride across the border. \n\nTraveling\
  \ to Paraguay gave me a chance to step outside of the realm of familiarity again.\
  \ This seemingly short four hour drive with three friends came to a complete stop\
  \ at the Argentina-Paraguay border. The official glanced at our passports before\
  \ his colleague followed him into a back office. I knew we were in trouble now.\
  \ They decided we could pass only after paying $150 USD apiece. Less than two minutes\
  \ later I realized that I only had pesos. Once the money did not appear, they instantly\
  \ started rattling unfamiliar Spanish. I had fallen victim to backdoor corruption.\n\
  \n There is an anxious feeling of getting across the border and safely returning\
  \ home, but the curiosity of walking a different way of life drew me closer to Paraguay.\
  \  The best part about about traveling back to Argentina was the power yerba mate\
  \ had in lessening the impact of these horrid encounters."
