Text: "I arrived in Los Angeles, a young man just out of college excited and amazed\
  \ that after all the mundane jobs I had done the adventure that I had saved so hard\
  \ for had begun, this once in a lifetime round the world trip is what I had dreamed\
  \ of ever since I read my first copy of national geographic, it was flicking through\
  \ those pages when I decided that I wanted to travel the world and experience different\
  \ cultures and see historic places, whilst on the plane I had got to know the lady\
  \ sitting next to me, her name was Jennifer, she was around 65 and she was going\
  \ to LA to meet a friend who she had not seen fo 15 years, we were both very excited,\
  \ leaving the airport I whistled for a cab just like in the movies, on the journey\
  \ to my hotel the cab driver gave me some useful tips on places to eat and things\
  \ to do whilst in LA, he also gave me hints on what colours not to wear as they\
  \ could be seen as being gang related and land me in a whole lot of trouble, we\
  \ finally arrived at the holiday inn near Santa Monica, as I walked into the lobby\
  \ and to the check in desk I was amazed to see Jennifer, it turns out she was staying\
  \ there also, the lady behind the desk couldn\u2019t believe it either when we told\
  \ her we had just shared the same 9 hour flight sitting next to each other, what\
  \ a small world it is she said, after getting my room key I headed upstairs to check\
  \ out my room the view was surprisingly good, Los Angeles has this sort of smog\
  \ that hangs just above the city but in its own way was quite pretty, I put the\
  \ television on whilst I unpacked and to my amazement there on the news was the\
  \ taxi driver I had just had being interviewed for a story, it turns out he had\
  \ driven an old lady from Los Angeles to Canada, the lady had spent over $1000 dollars\
  \ in cab fare, I couldn\u2019t believe the coincidence first with Jennifer and then\
  \ with the taxi driver, it\u2019s a very small world!"
