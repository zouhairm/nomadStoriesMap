Text: "Last year i made the choice to take my studies further a field and study my\
  \ chosen language among native speakers. I am well travelled and a regular solo\
  \ that normally phased by big moves, China however seemed like a completely different\
  \ kettle of fish and I will admit i was afraid. \n\nI was extremely anxious, jet\
  \ lagged and tired after a fifteen hour long journey to Beijing, China, with hardly\
  \ any sleep and little else to do other than question my move to the other side\
  \ of the world I disembarked with trepidation. \nJust going through security control\
  \ and passport/visa checks I was in complete culture shock, the sheer volume of\
  \ people within the airport was incredible, everyone was speaking in very rapid\
  \ very loud Chinese, the signs were all in Chinese (a logographic language I had\
  \ no prior knowledge of) the sounds and smells were all new, I felt completely lost\
  \ as though I had stepped off the plane in to a new world. \n  I was met here by\
  \ Liu Laoshi (teacher Liu) a form of address in China, I have now learnt is to be\
  \ used out of respect. This alone was something new for me as in English, my first\
  \ language, it is not common to address someone using their profession as a title.\
  \ \n Liu Laoshi and I unfortunately did not share a common language, we could not\
  \ have a conversation. We used body language, gestures and facial expressions as\
  \ well as a fair bit of google translation in order to communicate semi-effectively.\
  \ Doing this eventually lead to me going for breakfast with him and his wife the\
  \ following morning, them helping me with homework, finding me new Chinese cuisine\
  \ to sample, introducing me to friends at the school and generally making my experience\
  \ manageable and fun. I took his daughters phone number (she is studying English\
  \ in the UK) and she and I now do a language exchange once a week. This was all\
  \ done primarily without being able to speak to one another. I can now (although\
  \ admittedly not well) have a conversation with him and his wife and feel we have\
  \ developed a lasting friendship."
