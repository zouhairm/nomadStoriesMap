Text: "In November 2017, 63 of my classmates and I accompanied by my teachers were\
  \ taken on an industrial visit across Europe. It was a 10 day trip across 4 countries\
  \ and many cities. On an average we spent 8 hours in each place. Not adventurous,\
  \ I know, but once the people in charge would retire for the night, a group of 9-10\
  \ of us would venture out into the dark lonely streets of these cities.\nOne such\
  \ adventure was in Amsterdam. We stayed near the airport, a good 22km away from\
  \ the city, and public transport in Amsterdam is very expensive. Not to mention,\
  \ we didn\u2019t know the name of the places we wished to go to. So we chose to\
  \ travel by van.\nAmsterdam is famous for many things, but what we wanted to see\
  \ was called the red-light area. Yes, you probably rolled your eyes at this, but\
  \ you have to keep in mind that we were young girls from very strong Indian backgrounds,\
  \ and for a country that prides itself on the \u2018Kama Sutra\u2019 no one really\
  \ talks about it. No one would dare to talk about it at all. \nWe navigated ourselves\
  \ into this famous area, at first trying not to look directly at these women in\
  \ bare minimum, how could we? We didn\u2019t know if it was okay to look at them,\
  \ we didn\u2019t know if they wanted us to look at them. Half street down, we stop\
  \ and reminded each other that this isn\u2019t India, this isn\u2019t wrong here.\
  \ So on the count of 3, we agreed to look up and take in everything. On either side\
  \ of us there were large window boutiques, but instead of mannequins, there were\
  \ living women, dressed in clothing that flattered them. Each window was lit by\
  \ a pinkish-red light, making it quite literally the red light area. In the center\
  \ was an open drain with bridges, to cross over. There were men, women and teenagers\
  \ such as us.  We saw negotiations happening across the boutique windows, possibly\
  \ a way to insure the women were not harassed, and men with flushed faces leaving\
  \ these boutiques. To us, it seemed like an alternate universe. We saw couples holding\
  \ hands, some of them even adding locks to the grid of the bridge and throwing away\
  \ the key into the water below them. We saw intoxicated young adults trying to steady\
  \ themselves and we saw sober young adults trying to help them.\nFor the 10 of us,\
  \ it was indeed the last thing that we expected. The air itself seemed warm here,\
  \ the people seemed warmer. There was a vibe that made us feel confident and safe.\
  \ And even though photography was prohibited in this area, we swore we wouldn\u2019\
  t forget this place."
