Text: "I was thrilled to wear my red and gold traditional Caftan that flowed with\
  \ each step, even as I waited in line for the restroom inside of a Moroccan restaurant\
  \ halfway to my destination Chaouen. \u201CDo I look ok?\u201D I half-whispered\
  \ to a smiling girl wearing a shirt pinker than my blush. She answered in Arabic\
  \ and touched the lacy fabrics of her land that covered me from neck to toes. She\
  \ beamed as warm as the Moroccan sun and nodded approval.\n\nI started toward my\
  \ bus when enticing Arabic rap music erupted from a van with no doors. Young Moroccan\
  \ men danced and so did the girl with the pink shirt. The music resembled the undulating\
  \ call to prayer but with Western hip-hop beats layered on top of Arabic vocals.\n\
  \n\u0645\u0631\u062D\u0628\u0627\n\u201CMarhabaan!\u201D I called in greeting.\n\
  \nIt was one of two words I knew of her native tongue. She stretched both of her\
  \ arms in invitation to me. An ocean and over 9,000 km once separated our souls;\
  \ now our dark hair swayed in the same breeze. We intertwined our fingers and danced\
  \ to the beat; I lamented having to part before the song ended.\n\nChaouen was a\
  \ city of enchanting homes of blue. Bright greens and purples of the hijab of Moroccan\
  \ women meshed well with the oranges, reds and indigo rugs covering walls.  The\
  \ cerulean buildings and narrow pathways mesmerized travelers to climb each cobble-stoned\
  \ step, take selfies by every moorish door and venture into markets overflowing\
  \ with trinkets, fruits, fresh bread and oils. \n\nMy brain could barely harmonize\
  \ the want to be a tourist and the yearning to immerse as only a local can. I wandered\
  \ from the Medina towards the edge of the city. I saw her again, her pink shirt\
  \ emerged from a blue door above me. She stooped over a stone well to fill a pot.\
  \ She met my gaze and we laughed. It felt like a secret--like we knew of a hidden\
  \ world or language yet to be discovered by man. As she carried the pot back into\
  \ her home, I whispered the last word I knew into the wind and hoped my goodbye,\
  \ as light as air, would fly to her. \n\n\u0645\u064E\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u064E\
  \u0644\u0627\u0645\u0629\n\"Ma \u2018al salamah.\"\n\nI hiked a mountain that granted\
  \ travelers the ability to view her entire city framed by lambent green cacti and\
  \ rich black soil. This was her home; although history still gripped the women in\
  \ oppressive fists, she smiled. Would we ever meet again? I closed my eyes content\
  \ to feel the same soft sun she felt on her brown skin with the same melanin as\
  \ mine. Silently, I prayed for her and vowed to take her light with me to share\
  \ the universal language of kindness."
