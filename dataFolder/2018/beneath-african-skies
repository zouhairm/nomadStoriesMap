Text: "I hadn\u2019t imagined that a camel\u2019s back would be so broad. My feet\
  \ knocked against the beast\u2019s barrel-like belly as I rocked in the blanketed\
  \ saddle in time with his rolling gait. We had been climbing the sand dunes steadily,\
  \ my face shielded from the sun by a length of cotton wound around my head and looped\
  \ under my chin. Ahead of me, Mohamed\u2019s royal blue robes fluttered in the occasional\
  \ breeze that danced through the desert. He turned and gave me a half-smile from\
  \ the corner of his mouth before clicking his tongue at the caravan and returning\
  \ to face the sand that rose up before us. Having discovered that my camel was a\
  \ bull and that Mohamed had four children who went to school a little way from their\
  \ village, my French vocabulary was exhausted and we continued in an easy silence.\n\
  \nNot all of Africa is equal. I am a South African yet there was a rawness - a wildness\
  \ - in the Kingdom of Morocco that was wholly unfamiliar. And so whilst I exclaimed,\
  \ \u201CWe, too, are African!\u201D - the tawny skin of my Indian forebears appearing\
  \ commonplace in a land where the blood of Europeans and Africans converged to form\
  \ a glorious genepool of golden tones - I had not been able to easily identify with\
  \ these rifle-carrying, bride-snatching nomads.\n\nAt the summit of a larger dune,\
  \ Mohammed flattened the sand into a platform which he covered with the coarse blanket\
  \ that he lifted off my hairy steed. I feasted on roasted cashews washed down with\
  \ tepid Sprite. Licking the salt from my fingers, I watched the sun disappear beyond\
  \ the Sahara. I handed Mohamed a two hundred dirham note as if a price could be\
  \ placed on serendipity. He smiled and pressed a crude, marble camel into my hands.\
  \ \u201CUn cadeau.\u201D His generosity humbled me.\n\nBack into the convoy of motley,\
  \ 4x4 vehicles we were loaded. We travelled slowly on our return journey to Erfoud;\
  \ the headlights pinpricks of light against a darkened landscape. The convoy came\
  \ to an unexpected halt. \u201CYalla, yalla,\u201D coaxed our tour guide - inviting\
  \ us to join him outside. Ignitions were silenced and lights switched off. The night\
  \ became still, the air cool around us.\n\n\u201CLook up.\u201D\n\nAwestruck gasps\
  \ rippled through the group. The sky was alight with thousands of benevolent stars.\n\
  \nLooking out into the inky vastness of the universe, we were all equally insignificant.\
  \ Mohamed and I - for all our differences - would be indistinguishable from each\
  \ other. Iterations of humanity more alike than not. I have never been more grateful\
  \ for the reminder."
