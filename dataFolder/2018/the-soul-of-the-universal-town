Text: "It\u2019s our last week in India. Today my husband and I drove from Chennai\
  \ to Auroville not to sip hibiscus juice in the French style garden bistro and browse\
  \ the fancy boutiques, but to visit the interior of the Matrimandir. Unfortunately,\
  \ we are late: Mr. Babu just closed the office.\nMr. Babu issues the numbers. No\
  \ number, no access, states rule number one of the \u201Cfirst-time-visitor procedure\u201D\
  .\n \u201CSorry, sir\u201D, nudges my husband, \u201Cwe had to stop in Puducherry\
  \ for a drive-though permit\u201D. \nMr. Babu smiles: \u201CSure, sir, but no matter\
  \ what was keeping you, we have office hours\u201D.\nWe try our luck. The next morning,\
  \ we comply with step two of the procedure: watch the documentary. \nWe learn that\
  \ the Mother, French-born Mirra Alfassa who joined Sri Aurobindo in his ashram,\
  \ dreamed of building a town \u201Cwhere men and women of all countries are able\
  \ to live in peace and harmony\u201D. Volunteers from over forty-five nations believed\
  \ in her vision. On the screen, fluttering black and white images show people of\
  \ all ages and races pulling ropes and mixing mortar. \nOutside, Mr. Babu chuckles\
  \ when he sees us, and turns to the long line of visitors ready to show the numbers\
  \ my husband and I are missing.\nThere comes a family of four.\n\u201CHow old are\
  \ you?\u201D Mr Babu asks the younger son.\n\n\u201CTen.\u201D\n\n\u201CUnder twelves\
  \ not allowed.\u201D \n\n A parents\u2019 discussion settles that boy and father\
  \ will wait outside. The serendipitous turn of events we were hoping for.\nA battered\
  \ bus takes us to the building: a sphere covered in golden discs reflecting the\
  \ sunlight. Below it, visitors wait to be allowed in; some look inspired, like the\
  \ young woman swaying to her inner music, eyes closed. \nFinally, it\u2019s our\
  \ turn.\nStaff members in white outfits instruct us to maintain silence; we put\
  \ on white socks to climb up a white carpeted slope; upstairs, we are ushered into\
  \ the cool, circular chamber. All is candid inside: the walls, the flat cushions\
  \ we sit crossed-legged on, the carpet on the floor. Evenly spaced in a circle,\
  \ we face a translucent crystal sphere on a white pedestal illuminated by a single\
  \ ray of sunlight from the dome above. As in a space ship, I\u2019m transported\
  \ on a different planet, not in Space, but in Utopia.\nOur allotted time is up.\n\
  Back in the overwhelming life outside, I spot the inspired woman again, now hugging\
  \ the banyan tree.\nI exchange a mocking smile with my husband, but I have become\
  \ entangled in the spiritual vibes of this place: I feel refreshed and at peace.\
  \ \nNow I am ready to say my farewell to India."
