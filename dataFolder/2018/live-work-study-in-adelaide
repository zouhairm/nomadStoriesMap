Text: "Adelaide was where I made my first international travel as a student, with\
  \ only one suitcase and a backpack, and a dream of a new life abroad. I got off\
  \ the plane with not even the address of the house I was meant to go to because\
  \ simply I was too optimistic to think anything would go wrong. And anyway if it\
  \ did and my hosts will not show up at the airport, I will just ask police. (Why\
  \ not?) My hosts did look at me in disbelief when I told them that. They pointed\
  \ at my suitcase. \u201CIs that all you\u2019ve got with you?\u201D was their first\
  \ question.\n\nI really wanted a fresh start. Adelaide was my decision, a decision\
  \ that I knew would test me inside and out. Mind you, I don\u2019t drive. I never\
  \ have lived by myself. I barely cook. I only had my wits with me and a desire to\
  \ make it. My plan was to live in places abroad, not only just to visit but to experience\
  \ being truly integrated into the city I am in. Adelaide was the perfect place to\
  \ do just that. The city pushed me to the edge physically and mentally and yet supported\
  \ me all the way. I spent four years of studying instead of just two. I have moved\
  \ into five different places since those hosts who welcomed me from the airport.\
  \ I have worked numerous odd jobs that I have never done before. Life was harder\
  \ than it would have been if I stayed in my country. But I had to remember that\
  \ in the beginning, when we are going to embark on a new, uncharted journey, we\
  \ need to keep an open mind. I accepted change as it came.\n\nAnd yet, I had limitations.\
  \ The language, culture, socialization, food were all foreign to me. I encountered\
  \ discrimination so many times that I often ask myself, \u201CWhy am I here?\u201D\
  \ The other option was to give up and go home. While that wasn\u2019t the worst\
  \ idea, it was an expensive one. So, I tackled my limitations instead. I moved out\
  \ of my initial hosts to live in a house where everyone spoke English. I worked\
  \ as a waitress so I will be forced to talk to people. It meant being around strangers\
  \ all the time but because of this, my speaking improved. I made local friends.\
  \ Adelaide may seem like a small city but it has everything to offer. I can hop\
  \ on the tram to the beach, or take the train to see the wineries, or catch the\
  \ bus to go to the shops. I've been everywhere, all without driving myself. Adelaide\
  \ was just the right size, had the right mix of people, and the right culture for\
  \ a budding traveler to get a head start in life. I have loved the challenge it\
  \ gave me and I'd recommend it to everyone."
