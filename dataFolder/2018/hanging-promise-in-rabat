Text: "Overlooking the Bou Regreg river, the Kasbah of the Udayas was protected by\
  \ dazzling ramparts. A long white shore embraced the walls. Two children were playing\
  \ in the waves and their mother followed them into the water getting her djellaba\
  \ wet up to her knees. I took off my shoes. \xB4Hey ! Are you having fun?\xB4 A\
  \ curly headed, skinny guy asked me. He was smiling in such a candid way that I\
  \ could not just shrug him off. He was barefoot too. We dragged our feet onto the\
  \ seashore; Mohamed spoke fluent English that he had learnt on his own. He had melodious\
  \ phrasing with a sort of beat inside so that it was hard to tell if he was just\
  \ speaking or humming a tune. He was enthusiastic about the fact of having someone\
  \ to practice with. He had no job and no passport, so no chance to leave Morocco\
  \ and travel abroad. At a certain point, he asked me if I knew that God was limitless,\
  \ loving, generous and that He was everywhere. I can remember the brilliance of\
  \ his gaze. It was senseless but I invited him for a coffee. We covered all the\
  \ streets of the Kasbah, visited his friends\u2019 shops down in the Medina, he\
  \ introduced me to carpet sellers, spices sellers, leather sellers, never insisting\
  \ for me to buy something. We were finally sitting out in a terrace when his expression\
  \ suddenly turned surly and he spat up a curse in Arabic at some people passing,\
  \ for reasons that I could not fathom and I asked myself if I was hanging around\
  \ with a lunatic. At that moment a deep raspy voice echoed all over the alleys,\
  \ pausing my concerns. Out of that tongue-twister all I could recognize were the\
  \ words \xABAllahu Akbar\xBB. That was the muslim call for prayer, coming from the\
  \ Mosque. Mohamed leapt to his feet and asked me to wait for him while he was doing\
  \ his ablutions, he left me his backpack. When he came back, he had a smirk on his\
  \ face. He drew a little silver coin out from his pocket. One dirham: less than\
  \ ten cents. He took my hand as the most natural thing and led me to the market\
  \ where he exchanged that money for some bread and olives that he insisted on sharing\
  \ with me. He told me he wished to be able to join me on my trip, that maybe he\
  \ could borrow some money. He was aware he was grabbing at a fleeting hope. While\
  \ bidding farewell, I would have hugged him but we were in a public place, a man\
  \ and a woman, complete strangers to one another. I promised him that I would come\
  \ back in a week\u2019s time and find him on the same beach. I was not sure at that\
  \ moment if I was lying or not."
