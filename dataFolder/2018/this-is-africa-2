Text: "As I left Entebbe Airport to drive to Kampala, Uganda in a thunderstorm, my\
  \ driver hit another car in the parking lot. \n\n\"Just pay the guy 20K or we will\
  \ be stuck here for hours. TIA.\u201D\n\nTIA, or \u201CThis is Africa\u201D is a\
  \ common saying used to indicate the minor frustrations and workarounds of living\
  \ in Africa. Having followed my boyfriend from Canada to Kampala, Uganda, \"TIA\"\
  \ was a regular colloquialism for me within a week.\n\nArriving in Kampala at the\
  \ outset of their first annual rainy season is a lesson in schizophrenic weather.\
  \ Sweltering afternoons lead to thunderstorms in the early hours of the night or\
  \ morning, equating to howling winds and golf ball-sized rain drops. This, plus\
  \ jet lag, is far from restful. But when the storms stop and all you can hear are\
  \ the rustling of leaves in the breeze, and the beginning of an insect and avian\
  \ concerto, an incredible sense of peace and contentment wafts over you, even if\
  \ it isn\u2019t even 6 am yet.\n\nA emphatic rule follower most of my life, my greatest\
  \ fear about living in Kampala was not the possibility of illness, but transportation.\
  \ The heavy downpours erode the paved roads because there is no real drainage system,\
  \ creating massive potholes large enough to comfortably house a napping toddler\
  \ or two. There isn\u2019t an occasional pothole, there are dozens per kilometre.\
  \ Add to this the fact that there is no real public transportation system and nearly\
  \ everyone travels individually by private car or \u2018boda boda\u2019, the motorcycle\
  \ taxi system, and you get unprecedented traffic jams and safety hazards. Rules\
  \ of the road are more like guidelines as motorcycles weave between all other vehicles,\
  \ dodge potholes, and use red lights purely as reminders to look both ways before\
  \ zipping through crowded intersections. \n\nThere is an interesting sense of civic\
  \ pride in managing around these and pretty much all day-to-day inconveniences.\
  \ Women with their heads tightly wrapped with a bright, leaf patterned cloth, squat\
  \ in the road and fill the potholes as best they can with surrounding detritus.\
  \ No one yells or shouts during a traffic jam, it is considered the normal pace\
  \ of life. It is a society whose transportation isn't built on rules, because everyone\
  \ is expected to be spatially aware, and occasionally hitting the side of a vehicle\
  \ with a boda is normal. That being said, I'm buying a car to make sure I keep both\
  \ my arms and legs, even if it will have to be right-hand drive."
