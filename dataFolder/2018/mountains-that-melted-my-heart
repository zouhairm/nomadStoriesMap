Text: "A Chill breeze blew over me & I bloomed like a fresh flower in the morning.\n\
  \_\_\_The rising sun wrapped me around, with its rays, I felt the warm hug of welcome.\n\
  \_\_\_Perfect moment!! I started my road trip from Gulmarg to Leh, India. \n\_\_\
  \_Mountains with tall pine trees were on the adjacent sides of the road, gaurding\
  \ me. I reached the highways down.\n\_\_\_It was a perfect summer at kashmir with\
  \ 10 degree celsius temperature. I live in a city, where summer means 35-40 degree\
  \ celsius.\n\_\_\_\_Parked my vehicle near a Tea shop. Had a sip of kashmiri tea,\
  \ thinking about the natural beauty and climate of the city, taste of the kashmiri\
  \ chai. Everything was perfectly blended. I had a crush on kashmir.\n\_\_\_  I headed\
  \ towards sonmarg, which is a place for mountains, of green meadows. It was so cool\
  \ for my eyes. Clicked few photographs. So far everything seemed to be cool. \n\_\
  \_\_ I was nearing zojila pass. It's a muddy road at the edge of the mountain. I\
  \ was looking on the down steep at one side of the road & the mud mountain at the\
  \ other side, with a small waterfall crossing the pass, which may cause land slide.\n\
  \_\_\_ Felt that, Most beautiful things in the world are the most dangerous ones.\
  \ Still, it's a nature that never fades & i can risk for it. \n\_\_\_Tough roads\
  \ always lead us to happy times. But I never knew it led me to the heaven. \n\_\_\
  Ice bergs melting from the mountain, forming the streams. I went near the melting\
  \ point. Felt the shock of the water stream. It was freezing, I couldn't stand for\
  \ long time. \n\_\_\_\_ So, i started heading to kargil. Place which was surrounded\
  \ by mountains. The Land of war. It's such a beautiful place !!\n\_\_\_\_ I noticed\
  \ several types of mountains, on my road trip to leh. Mountains made of rock, mud,\
  \ trees, stones, different types of minerals were found in different Mountains,\
  \ it was glittering and stunning. \n\_\_\_ I had fallen in love with nature, each\
  \ & every minute gazing at the mountains. \n\_\_\_ My heart was pumping high.\n\
  \    No matter whatever they are made up of, they stood stronger, alone, bearing\
  \ the heat & the cold, the rain & the storm. \n\_\_\_ They are the goddess that\
  \ creates stream which leads to the ocean, gives life to several living beings.\
  \ \n\_\_\_ Mountains are the most beautiful things in the world. Magnetic hills\
  \ mesmerized my hard heart & i felt myself melting at the beauty of the mountains.\
  \ \n\_\_\_\_ I felt lighter, emotional and sensed the peace within myself.\n   \
  \  With mindful of peace, I ended the trip.\nIn love with Nature !!"
