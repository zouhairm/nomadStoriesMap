Text: "I blinked my eyes, wiping my canon lens as I gazed towards the unpigmented\
  \ mountains that stretched along the frozen rivers. My camera \u2018clucked\u2019\
  \ seven times, snapping a few white forest shots before entering the tunnel. As\
  \ the chaotic snow non-stoppingly bounced on the window glass and eventually fused\
  \ into clear fluid, I couldn\u2019t imagine how cold it was to step outside the\
  \ train.\n\nAfter one-hour train ride to the northern part of Akita Prefecture,\
  \ I got off the 40-foot long orange train to embrace the icy cotton-like substance\
  \ on my face. I was headed for the Snow Monster Festival. Being a solo traveler\
  \ who had never seen this massive amount of snow, my soul was thrilled with joy.\n\
  \nLittle did I know things could turn out differently as planned. When I arrived\
  \ at the ski area, I was informed that the ropeway operation stopped due to strong\
  \ wind. I was unbelievably upset as another vigorous blow of wind hit my face. Maybe\
  \ today just wasn\u2019t my day. \n\nTo my surprise, my broken Japanese managed\
  \ to get me a free pass for snowboarding in exchange. \u201CThis trip isn\u2019\
  t half bad\u201D, I said to myself as I strapped the helmet around my chin.\n\n\
  The ski lift took me to over 6,500 feet off ground level. As I made my third cruise\
  \ down the hill, I saw a toppling creamy brown motion about 100 feet away. I wish\
  \ my eyesight were better. Coming closer towards the mysterious object, I got excited\
  \ when I realized it was a furry pup, the exact same breed as the legendary Hachiko.\
  \ His name was \u2018Hofto\u2019, which is a star\u2019s name in Japanese. Ironically,\
  \ this famous Akita dog was over half my size despite being barely a year old. In\
  \ Japan, Akita dogs are considered \u2018Great Japanese Dogs\u2019 as they were\
  \ once used to guard the royal family back in the days. Today, if you are lucky\
  \ enough, you can watch them muddling playfully in the snow. The moment of disappointment\
  \ immediately transformed into exhilaration. \n\nA few Japanese visitors were trying\
  \ to get a photo with Hofto, but he came straight up to me as if we were best buddies.\
  \ I kneeled so that I can see him better as he sniffed my face several times. People\
  \ were squeaking 'Kawaii!\u2019, which means cute in Japanese. I hugged Hofto, pet\
  \ him a few times, and told him he really made my day. \n\nFor this trip, I wasn\u2019\
  t intending to meet any locals in this secluded area, let alone the language barrier;\
  \ but despite not having a common language, I surely made a new friend who comes\
  \ from a completely different world."
