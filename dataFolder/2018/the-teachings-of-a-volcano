Text: "This is a story about adventure. But also about love, kindness, survival and\
  \ important lessons to be learned.\nFor my first solo travel and out of sheer stubborness,\
  \ I was determined to conquer the top of Guatemalan volcan Tajumulco, at 4220 meters,\
  \ all by myself. The highest point in Central America. The fact that I was a smoker\
  \ with zero hiking experience, didn't seem to affect my decision much.\nMistake\
  \ after mistake, I was led to a cheap hostel in Xela, Guatemala. There, my good\
  \ fortune sent me a wandering Salvadoran artist. Eduardo, the liar of my heart!\n\
  Four days after my arrival we were in love and ready to embark together on the adventure.\
  \ We rented a cheap tent and around noon off we went. Our big mistakes had already\
  \ been made.\nIt was raining and I was slow, but Eduardo was always waiting for\
  \ me a few meters ahead, showing me impressive mushrooms and fancy dance moves.\
  \ Which only meant an even slower ascend.\nBy dusk we were soaked and had missed\
  \ the campground. In heavy rain and thick fog, at 4000 meters, we chose a nice windy\
  \ opening by a steep cliff to set up our tent. That's right. We set up our tent\
  \ by a steep cliff! Only to discover that our tent had no zippers and a broken pole.\n\
  All night we sat there.\nWet to the bone, with little air to breath and feet numb\
  \ from the cold. As a source of heat and comfort, we only had each other.\nThe latter\
  \ may sound romantic, but it was not. We were truly miserable, basically trying\
  \ to keep each other alive.\nEduardo was soothing me in my panick attacks. Thankfully,\
  \ he convinced me that hiking back in the middle of the night with broken flashlights\
  \ was a bad idea.\nFinally, hope warmed up our souls, in the form of light coming\
  \ from far away. I started calling for help.\nA wonderful American tourist with\
  \ a local guide helped us without a second thought. They fed us oreos for calories\
  \ and patiently (very patiently), they lit our way to the top. \nThere, I saw the\
  \ sun rising over a sea of perfect bright coloured clouds. It was without a doubt\
  \ the most beautiful thing I had ever experienced. I felt blessed. And lucky.\n\
  That moment I realised that there is nothing in the world that I could not do.\n\
  Later on of course, I realised more.\nThat I had to respect the mountain, the wild\
  \ and my fragile human nature. That I had to quit smoking and always hike with good\
  \ gear.\nBut more importantly, that if a charismatic, handsome man saves my life\
  \ on a volcano, I shouldn't be sure that he is not a little bit crazy!\nLessons\
  \ learned!"
