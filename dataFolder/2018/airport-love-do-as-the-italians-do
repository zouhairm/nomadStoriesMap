Text: "I like airports so much that I can spend hours and hours sitting somewhere\
  \ and observing. For me, an airport or a train station are sacred places, obviously\
  \ not at night, but even at night some of them have their charm. This time I had\
  \ a stopover in Milan, waiting for my plane to Sicily. Since I didn\u2019t know\
  \ yet from which gate my plane was supposed to leave, I decided to sit in front\
  \ of the gate where was written one of my favorite destination. \nOnce I found the\
  \ place, laid the backpack, my observation began, all kinds of people: people who\
  \ travel for work, backpackers, couples, mothers with kids, old people .. But everywhere\
  \ I noticed so much love, and they were mostly Italian couples.\nI was meditating\
  \ looking around. A couple on the age of 60 and two teenagers. The kids aside to\
  \ play with the phone, and mom and dad in love kissing next to their kids. OK, it's\
  \ time to change the gate, maybe I caught this one of the lovers. I moved. However,\
  \ love has decided to follow me. A young couple, she was black, he was white, holding\
  \ her by the hand and looking at her, but you cannot imagine how he was looking\
  \ at her, there was so much love in his eyes, but I couldn't see her eyes because\
  \ she had her head down and eyes fixed in the cellphone. \nLast scene, while I'm\
  \ still staring at the very young couple, I heard a voice: -is it free? I looked\
  \ up and I saw a guy in his 30s who was asking me if he could sit down. Of course,\
  \ I replied and immediately moved my backpack. Few seconds later he took the phone\
  \ and called someone:\n\"Hello amore? Blabla Yes, I just arrived at the airport.\
  \ Blabla Of course amore, I took everything. BlablaYes, I know. But tell me, honey,\
  \ how are you? blablab Ahh my love I do not know how I'll do these three days without\
  \ you. Blabla It's okay amore. Balbla Of course my sweetheart  I will call you every\
  \ day. Blablabla I love you too, amore. I kiss you amore, amoremorerer\"\nI really\
  \ wanted to get up and move, I\u2019ve already heard so many times this kind of\
  \ conversations, especially when I'm on the train and I have nothing to do and I\
  \ listen to the phone calls of others. But this guy has exaggerated, seriously.\n\
  I will conclude with a question: This love is true? Boh! I hope so, because it's\
  \ really nice to be surrounded by so much love. And every time I come back to Italy,\
  \ I hear the word \u201Camore\u201D everywhere... and here it comes again AMOREEEEEE"
