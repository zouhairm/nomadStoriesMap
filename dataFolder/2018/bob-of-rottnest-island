Text: "I stepped off the ferry and zipped my jacket tight. The wind was blowing in\
  \ from the all-surrounding ocean as I took my first steps towards the center of\
  \ Rottnest Island in search of the cute, furry animals called quokkas which this\
  \ holiday island outside Perth was famous for. It wasn\u2019t long after I spotted\
  \ my first quokkas which looked like an adorable combination of kangaroo and mouse.\
  \ After taking a few hundred selfies with the quokkas and considering whether I\
  \ could steal one or just stay forever and become the \u201CQuokka Whisperer\u201D\
  \ I walked up to a white cottage which according to the sign outside once had belonged\
  \ to a convict. An older man in his 70\u2019s with the brightest white hair and\
  \ the greatest smile walked out of the building. I knew right away he was a character\
  \ to write home about and I decided to call him Bob in my travel diary. Bob had\
  \ a lanyard from the island\u2019s museum around his neck, so I approached him and\
  \ asked how a convict could end up with such a sweet deal because getting a cottage\
  \ on a beautiful island with quokkas as pets did not sound like the worst kind of\
  \ punishment to me. He happily told me about the convict who had been a bit of a\
  \ pyromaniac and stolen horses in both East and West of Australia. The convict had\
  \ finally been sentenced to live out his days on the remote island, left to build\
  \ the cottage himself, beautifully locked away from civilization. Mind you, this\
  \ was all in the 19th century so the island didn\u2019t have caf\xE9s and a convenient\
  \ super market as it does today. Shocking, right?\nBob himself was a purebred Perthian\
  \ and had grown up going on holidays to the island although back then what you brought\
  \ with you was all you would have for your stay. It sounded a bit like the 1800s\
  \ except you didn\u2019t have to steal a horse to go to the island and there were\
  \ cottages built for the very first stream of tourists. When I later managed to\
  \ get lost cycling around the island I saw why Bob had a soft spot for this little\
  \ island just outside the most remote city in the world. The soft rolling hills,\
  \ the charm of having only one of most things and simultaneously having a million\
  \ tiny beaches was enough to win me over as well. I made it to the tour just in\
  \ time to hear my white-haired tour guide introduce himself. \u201CHi guys, my name\
  \ is Bob and I\u2019m here to give you a tour of the village.\u201D"
