Text: "\u201CWhat am I going to wear if not jeans? Linen pants? I\u2019ll look like\
  \ a walking Ann Taylor catalogue!\u201D I thought as I sorted through clothing.\
  \ It wasn\u2019t that I couldn\u2019t wear jeans, the company that was transferring\
  \ me to Singapore allowed casual dress. I was told I would not want to in a climate\
  \ with such a high humidity level that non breathable clothes start sticking to\
  \ your body the moment you go outside. Sticky denim was hard to imagine but I would\
  \ take the word of experts.\n\nI knew accepting a role managing the Southeast Asia\
  \ advertising team for my company would be challenging, however being an expat in\
  \ an exciting foreign city was my driving force. I pictured myself working in a\
  \ modern high rise and exploring exotic destinations. Weekends would be relaxing\
  \ on tropical beaches and exploring historic colonial towns, stuffing myself with\
  \ all of the amazing food promised by the guidebooks, just like the Singapore tourism\
  \ commercial I watched on repeat.\n\n Before leaving, I learned that my first stop\
  \ would be a month of training in India. The country was like nothing I had ever\
  \ experienced and this is coming from an avid world traveler. The sights, smells\
  \ and chaos confronted me the moment I deplaned. It was challenging just walking\
  \ to work, dodging cars and a pack of wild dogs who greeted me every morning as\
  \ I left my guesthouse. I knew that I would have culture shock but I had no idea\
  \ that there would be days where I would be pushed to my physical and emotional\
  \ limits.\n\nI was exhausted by the time I reached Singapore, however there would\
  \ be no time for rest. I had to start my job and find a place to live. I needed\
  \ to buy all of the necessities that I took for granted. I had nothing except my\
  \ suitcase. I had to figure out transportation and set up a bank account. I was\
  \ not a tourist anymore, this was real life.\n\nI eventually settled into routine.\
  \ There were days when I thought I was going to lose my mind, however it wasn\u2019\
  t long before I felt like a local. I argued with my dry cleaner in Singlish and\
  \ figured out what to do when a toilet leaked in the middle of the night and there\
  \ were no 24 hour plumbers. I wanted to give up and leave countless times but I\
  \ persevered. I stayed in Singapore almost two years, visited incredible places\
  \ and met amazing people. I came home ten pounds heavier but a hundred times wiser.\
  \ Now each time I am faced with challenges, I reflect on this time. I not only survived\
  \ but thrived. I also learned that linen is unbelievably comfortable."
