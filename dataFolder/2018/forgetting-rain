Text: "It was only the third day of summer rain but Catania\u2019s storm drains were\
  \ already overflowing. The usually bustling Piazza Duomo was now a polluted lake\
  \ of cigarette butts and broken umbrellas, the elephant fountain quite excessive.\
  \ And then Etna errupted.\n\nDarting through the downpour towards her home, I asked\
  \ my friend Chiara whether we should evacuate. She was unmoved.\n\n\"In this weather?\
  \ Forget about it!\"\n\nWe waded through the desolate rivers of the lava stone roads,\
  \ only the street-vendors of South-Asian origins roaming around and addressing us\
  \ to offer an umbrella from their selection. We ignored them and Chiara later scoffed:\
  \ \u201CIt will take three generations before they become Sicilians.\u201D\n\nI\
  \ told her I wanted to see Etna.\n\n\"What? Now? It\u2019s raining!\"\n\n\"How often\
  \ does one see a volcano erupt?\"\n\n\"All the time!\"\n\nShe was convinced I wouldn\u2019\
  t see a thing but when I reached the concrete pier of the port, an immense view\
  \ opened over all of Catania, red roofs in steps going up like a great rice field\
  \ towards Etna that stood above all. There, two narrow brooks of lava idled down\
  \ and evoked \u2013 I understood now Chiara\u2019s apathy \u2013 the image of a\
  \ nosebleed.\n\nThere was a man on the pier with me who resembled the other young\
  \ refugees, those sitting hunched together under the shadows of the sycamores on\
  \ Piazza Teatro, skinny hands sunk into boardshorts with a palm-tree print, gaze\
  \ lost. \n\n\"Aren\u2019t you afraid of the rain like the Sicilians?\" I asked him.\n\
  \n\"No. Where I\u2019m from in Nigeria it\u2019s monsoon season now.\"\n\nHis name\
  \ was Isa and we spoke for a while in Italian. Isa said he works here in the port,\
  \ cleaning at a caf\xE8. He\u2019d been rescued four years ago by a coastguard ship\
  \ much like the one anchored behind us.\n \nI offered him some biscuits I had in\
  \ my bag.\n\nIsa shook his head. \"Can\u2019t eat. Ramadan.\"\n\nHe was silent for\
  \ a second, then smiled. \"Actually, we used to cheat during Ramadan. When our father\u2019\
  s weren\u2019t there, we\u2019d go out under the rain, mouths open to the sky. We\
  \ shouldn\u2019t have but we did, anyway.\"\n\n\"Do you ever miss home?\"\n\n\"\
  No. Well, sometimes \u2013 during Ramadan.\"\n\nI had an idea. I closed the umbrella\
  \ and widened my mouth to the clouds. It was flooded in a second but I saw Isa laugh.\
  \ He hesitated, then did exactly the same.\n\nIt occured to me how un-Sicilian both\
  \ of us must have seemed. Maybe this was what Chiara had meant. \n\nHow does anyone\
  \ ever become a local? \n\nI suppose you have to forget the rain. And then, when\
  \ no one\u2019s looking, you can cheat a little."
