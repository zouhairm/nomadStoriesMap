Text: "As our car pulled into the gravel driveway, I had to wonder if I was completely\
  \ mad. It didn\u2019t help that Kadek, my driver, had been vacillating between lost\
  \ confusion and despair for the last fifteen minutes. \n\nHis relieved eyes met\
  \ mine in the rear-view mirror and he gestured for me to get out. We had arrived\
  \ at last. \n\nThe Indonesian villa was larger than I had anticipated, and a tiny\
  \ Balinese woman greeted me as I took in the lush surroundings. She motioned for\
  \ me to wait before vanishing. Offerings for the gods that you would expect to be\
  \ present at any Balinese residence were scattered in abundance.  \n\nThe woman\
  \ I had traveled such a long way to meet appeared in front of me, clad in floaty,\
  \ white garments. Her eyes were kind which rendered me temporarily at ease. \n\n\
  She introduced herself to me as \u201CIbu Jero\u201D. I knew from my research she\
  \ was a fifth generation High Priestess. \n\nWhen planning my solo adventure to\
  \ Bali months earlier my intention had been to enjoy hot days with cocktails by\
  \ the pool and hair-raising scooter rides through throngs of people in bustling\
  \ Seminyak. Instead, here I stood with trepidation in a village in the middle of\
  \ nowhere. \n\nThe Universe, as it often does, had a different plan for my trip.\
  \ Upon hearing of the miraculous healing benefits people had experienced with this\
  \ High Priestess, my desire for cheap entertainment and relaxation had become heavily\
  \ outweighed by intrigue for the magic I might experience if I dared to leave my\
  \ comfort zone. \n\nShe led me into a small, dark room. The sweet incense that had\
  \ wafted innocently outside now hung thick and heavy around me. \n\nI lay on the\
  \ bed in front of her and a slight sense of panic set in. Heart racing, I closed\
  \ my eyes. I felt her place a crystal lightly on my forehead and to my surprise\
  \ a searing pain shot to the back of my skull. I had read that the poke or prod\
  \ of a Balian could cause physical pain, but was too pragmatic to believe it at\
  \ the time. \n\nPlacing a hand on my breastbone,  Ibu Jero was silent. I felt my\
  \ throat close over completely, like someone had their hands round my neck, strangling\
  \ me. Visions of people, places and memories flooded my mind. My grandfather that\
  \ had passed years earlier appeared. Tears streamed from my eyes as the man who\
  \ had broken my heart stood before me and I mourned painful childhood memories.\n\
  \nSadness, pain, anger and relief washed over me in waves. I understood why I was\
  \ here. This healing was more important than I could have imagined."
