Text: "\u201CA herring sandwich and a glass of wine, please\u201D I said. The waitress\
  \ smiled politely. She had asked me if I wanted anything thrice by then but I was\
  \ busy trying to take a selfie. A dozen attempts later I gave up, stood my phone\
  \ against a glass and set the timer. That picture is pinned at my desk \u2013 I'm\
  \ sitting by the canal and a couple photobombs my effort in the background. Amsterdam\
  \ isn't for the single, hearts or glasses of wine. I had taken a walking tour that\
  \ day \u2013 the Ann Frank Huis, the museums, the parks, the pubs and then a canal\
  \ ride. For all the prettiness in the world, I couldn't ignore the couples laying\
  \ flat on their tummies by the canal, drinking beer, watching the world go by. A\
  \ group of men in underwear and capes and flashing red hairbands stumbled out of\
  \ a bar as I walked back to my hostel. Somebody was having a bachelor party they\
  \ weren't forgetting. My eight-seater dorm was empty. At one in the morning, I pulled\
  \ a beer out of my bag, propped my feet against the window, and chugged. Amsterdam\
  \ was beautiful by night. I took a train to Utrecht the next day.  The red haired\
  \ man at the hostel reception smiled at me as I sat in the cafe. \u201CTake a cycle\u201D\
  , he suggested. Grabbing a map, he traced his finger along a route marked in red.\
  \ \u201CIs it safe?\u201D I asked. The last time I rode a cycle was 14 years ago\
  \ and I didn't want to end up in the hospital. \u201CHe's going too,\u201D he said,\
  \ pointing to a man stuffing his jacket in his bag. In about ten minutes, Ethan\
  \ and I were out of the city, cycling past canals bordered by greens that stretched\
  \ endlessly. That cycle was huge, I had to drag my feet to stop. We rode past houses\
  \ sitting squat on farms and grazing cows and ducks. We rode past a lone woman sitting\
  \ at the bus stop and a store dangling a sign that read 'coconuts for sex.' Stopping\
  \ by a supermarket, we bought lunch and sat by the closest canal, eating sandwiches\
  \ and drinking coffee. Ethan was American, he was attending a conference, and was\
  \ taking the day off. He had worked in Nepal and spoke some Hindi. I taught him\
  \ cuss words that he jotted down, meanings and all. That evening as we climbed our\
  \ way to the top of the Dom Tower, I couldn't take my eyes off the roofs that jutted\
  \ from below, the canals that snaked across the city. Some time later, we walked\
  \ to a cafe that sat partly hidden under a bridge and took a table right by the\
  \ river. Round paper lights shone across the canopy. \u201CTwo glasses of wine,\
  \ please,\u201D Ethan said. The waiter smiled."
