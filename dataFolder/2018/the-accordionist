Text: "The Victoria Underground spewed me out in a crowd of bodies, hot and stuffy\
  \ in the city\u2019s August air. I was escaping the path of some tourist\u2019s\
  \ riling child and I didn\u2019t care which way I was going, as long as it was an\
  \ opposite one. My layers of penguin-like black and white felt sticky now, and something\
  \ from the platters l\u2019d served had ended up smeared on my uniform. Here in\
  \ this urban behemoth, I was one more starry-eyed Antipodean hoping to unearth London\u2019\
  s bohemian magic, but minioned into the grease-ship clockwork of the city\u2019\
  s hotel swank.\n\nThe pavement was tight, but there was something shiny-red swinging\
  \ along ahead. It was an accordion. I was in the wake of a tramp-like man with it\
  \ slung over one flannel shoulder, his potato-like figure lolloping from side to\
  \ side. Like a beacon of that sought-after magic, the accordion beckoned me; reminded\
  \ me of a creative soul seeking a channel. And so, I leapt forward and asked where\
  \ he had attained it. \nA bulbous-nosed face turned and peered from eyelids askew.\
  \ He looked blankly at me as I spoke, then replied eagerly in a rolling of possibly\
  \ Italian, mixed with meaty hand gestures. I gestured back, and thinking I was wanting\
  \ to play it, right there, he bowed his capped head and shed the accordion. \nWhy\
  \ not. The straps were the loosest I\u2019d worn as I tried the bellows in and out\
  \ \u2013 a beautiful creaky ancient sound, with the scent of musty attics - and\
  \ he was suddenly holding the loose straps against my back. He motioned to cross\
  \ the road and, as I was being physically led from behind, I crossed. He lolloped\
  \ off and for a second I thought he\u2019d abandoned the instrument with me, until\
  \ he returned with a flutter of free newspapers from the giveaway stand, laying\
  \ them out over white pigeon splats that littered the seat of a majestic statue.\
  \ He sat, and beckoned me to join. \nI thought about what the rush of passing Londoners\
  \ were seeing \u2013 a girl dressed in catering smarts, playing dizzily on a ruby-red\
  \ accordion next to the withering yet jolly character of a possibly-homeless Romany\
  \ man. \n\nAnd I smiled. The bohemian magic was there.\nAfter a few carnivalesque\
  \ ditties, I stopped. Like a sleepy old cat, he turned to me and held up fat fingers,\
  \ counting on them and tapping his wrist. Was this an invite for a rendez-vous?\
  \ I never quite found out. Maybe I didn\u2019t want to. I pried myself away with\
  \ an insisted kiss on the hand, returning the grateful flamboyant gestures. Maybe\
  \ the magic is better that way \u2013 one slip at a time."
