Text: "I woke up with a raging headache and no recollections of anything. A few seconds\
  \ later it all came back in hazy flashes \u2013 the Prague pub crawl, the plethora\
  \ of Bohemian Absinthe and Czech Beer and the pain in my feet because of all the\
  \ dancing. Then, I shot up from my bed and frantically began rummaging through my\
  \ coat to no avail. I realized I had absolutely no clue where my wallet and passport\
  \ was. \n\nFor the first few minutes all I felt was denial. This was a dream. The\
  \ denial quickly morphed into sheer disbelief. I was a nineteen year old on my first\
  \ solo trip. I was a good girl and curiosity had urged me to venture out one night,\
  \ just one night on an organized pub crawl. This couldn\u2019t be happening to me\
  \ right!? I began ransacking all my belongings in hopes of locating the lost wallet\
  \ and passport but all efforts were futile. As agonizing as it was, I concluded\
  \ that it had either fallen out of coat pocket or had been taken from it the previous\
  \ night. I was officially in a foreign country without my passport. Then the tears\
  \ came. I was a ball of emotions \u2013 anger, regret, denial, disbelief, hurt,\
  \ and self-loathing, all of them finding an outlet through my tears.  I think I\
  \ sat on that bed crying for roughly two hours, hugging myself. How could I have\
  \ been so irresponsible?\nThe tears were soon replaced by an imperturbable levelheadedness.\
  \ I realized that no Prince Charming would swoop in riding a White Horse and save\
  \ me. No, I had to save myself. I made my way to the Receptionist and requested\
  \ him to help me locate my missing belongings and I filed a police complaint. I\
  \ printed out all the necessary forms, filled them out and made my way to the US\
  \ Embassy to cancel my old passport and get a new one. It was hard, dealing with\
  \ the unexpected and having to get up and function, but I think it made me realize\
  \ that I was stronger than I thought I was, that I was a capable, independent woman.\n\
  \nWhen people ask me how my trip was, I say it was beautiful, but when they ask\
  \ me how travelling alone was, I say it was hard, but I wouldn\u2019t change an\
  \ inch of it \u2013 because I like many others had fallen in love with the act of\
  \ travelling alone, because it taught me to be my own Hero and because it made me\
  \ realize that I would be thrown into unexpected circumstances, but what made my\
  \ trip (and my life) beautiful was how I dealt with these circumstances and the\
  \ experiences and lessons I took away from them. Oh, I also learnt to handle my\
  \ alcohol and belongings better! :P"
