Text: "I stopped the scooter in front of a small restaurant, sheltered under colored\
  \ beach umbrellas. An incessant drizzle wet Ha Giang for days.  \n\nSited in north\
  \ Vietnam, it is the starting point for motorbikes trips around the Dong Van Karst\
  \ Plateau Geopark and host old villages where is possible to stay for the night.\
  \ The rain hadn\u2019t allowed me to do much, and when I couldn\u2019t explore the\
  \ mountains tracks I would go back to the city. \n\nIf French colonization had influenced\
  \ the architecture, brought crunchy baguette into the cuisine, well, Ha Giang people\
  \ hadn\u2019t an aptitude for languages. They only speak Vietnamese. Any intent\
  \ of mine to communicate made them smile.\n\nTrying to undo my helmet, three women\
  \ run out of the restaurant. Giggling and smiling, they started to touch and pull\
  \ on strands of my hair.\nI tilted my head in front of the peculiar group. The oldest\
  \ one, trying to prove something about my rarity, smelled my scalp and a long loud\
  \ laugh determined the inspection. My hair was natural, not an auburn curly wig.\n\
  \nI followed the trio to the restaurant. A man was aspiring tick smoke from a large\
  \ bamboo pipe that ended in a water bucket. The puffs of smoke bubbled up the liquid.\
  \ \n\nVietnamese people smoke a lot. The smoked taste of a cigarette marries beautifully\
  \ with the sweet almond flavoured coffee of the region. \nThe guy refilled the pipe\
  \ and offered me the long stick.\n\nI had now a small audience. The youngest woman\
  \ winkled to me, supportive. \n\nBut bamboo pipes are for hardened smokers.  My\
  \ coughs and tears made them laugh and cold beer appeared to restore my throat.\n\
  \nI had never been in a place where I couldn\u2019t communicate. I am a talker.\
  \ The queen of small and deep conversation, my tongue dances between my teeth with\
  \ no effort. \n\nBut in Ha Giang streets anybody spoke English or French. \n\nNone\
  \ of my new friends would.  But hunger knows no languages. When I pointed out the\
  \ boiled chickens nicely disposed on a tray, the becks open on a last desperate\
  \ shout, the women smiled as my grandma would.\n\nThey served me a bowl of chicken\
  \ boiling broth. As mothers of an innocent child, they gently pushed me towards\
  \ a table. We all sat together.\n\nThose three women stared at me, silently waiting\
  \ my first sip.\n\nThe delicate flavor of spring onion, an unexpected comforting\
  \ potato and soft vermicelli in my mouth, instantly made my lips curve into an approval\
  \ smile. \n\nTheatre applauses warmed up the place. \n\nIt felt good to not have\
  \ to speak, after all."
