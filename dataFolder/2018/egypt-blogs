Text: "This is a story about a holiday with my mother and younger brother last year\
  \ in Sharm-el-Sheikh, Egypt. My name is Akram, but most people call me Aki. I\u2019\
  m 30 and work as a podiatrist. My mum is called Shafali and my brother who is 24\
  \ is called Tal - an I.T specialist. We live in Manchester.\nTrip to Shark Bay\n\
  I soared through the sky as I paraglided with my friend Ibby. Below us were the\
  \ rolling waves of Shark Bay, a crescent of beaches about 10 kilometres north of\
  \ Sharm-el-Sheikh. Craning my neck I could see far behind our families relaxing\
  \ on their deck chairs.\nAfter landing we went to the beachside huts where there\
  \ were a couple of tourist shops, selling souvenirs and snacks. My older brother\
  \ joined us. The shop owner was a swarthy, portly middle-aged man wearing dark sunglasses\
  \ and long thick wavy black hair, and a pock marked face. His name was Jabeil and\
  \ he wanted to practise his English with us. \nShark bay II\nI wondered if indeed\
  \ there were sharks roaming in the blue sea. In order to reach the inviting water,\
  \ we crossed a jetty to bypass the coral shelf immediately adjacent to the beach.\
  \ There me and my brother hopped into a speedboat, joined by a young Egyptian called\
  \ Karim and another dark-complexioned Egyptian man who was the driver. The boat\
  \ coughed and spluttered into life as the driver took the helm. \nNow on a nice\
  \ fast speed Karim began to snap pictures of us, whilst simultaneously engaging\
  \ in towel origami, making all kinds of weird and wonderful shapes with a towel,\
  \ which he then placed on our heads. \nNa\u2019ama Bay\nThis evening we decided\
  \ to head out to explore the hub of Sharm el Sheikh, Na\u2019ama Bay. Our bus dropped\
  \ us off in the din of the popular resort of Na'ama Bay. The restaurants doubled\
  \ as shisha bars, and each had a band of dancers dancing like wild dervishes in\
  \ time to the beat, fast, loud and frenetic. We stopped into one of these and relaxed\
  \ on one of the low slung settees.  \nFinal trip to Shark Bay\nOur last day in Sharm-el-Sheikh\
  \ and we spent another leisurely day in Shark Bay. I spotted Jabeil sat on the bench\
  \ in front of the beach shops and went over to say hello. He scurried away somewhere,\
  \ coming out a few minutes later with a black photo album. \nHe showed us a collection\
  \ of photos of him in his youth with various tourists. I made a \u2018thumbs up\u2019\
  \ sign. We shook hands and bade one another farewell.\nFinal thoughts\nWe made many\
  \ friends during our magical week in Sharm'el Sheikh and I look forward to visiting\
  \ again soon."
