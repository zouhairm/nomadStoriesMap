Text: "July 2015. School vacation. An opportunity arises to go to S\xE3o Paulo, the\
  \ land of the drizzle and paradise of skyscrapers. As a good adventurer, I accepted\
  \ my aunt-grandmother's invitation to spend a week in this big city.\nThe travel\
  \ route has become the best part for me since my trip to the state of Tocantins,\
  \ which I spent 30 hours on the bus. But from my city in the interior of S\xE3o\
  \ Paulo, Mar\xEDlia, to the capital did not take that long, it was 6 hours in total,\
  \ full of natural landscapes, pastures and developing cities.\nGetting there was\
  \ a mixture of joy and anxiety. The reflection of the buildings in my eyes, along\
  \ with rap music on my headphones, made me think about society in contrast to my\
  \ life in a small town. What the songs described I was seeing in front of me. Every\
  \ homeless person I saw I wanted to talk, listen to your stories, but when you travel\
  \ with your great-aunt, this is not possible.\nThe fear of being mugged took over\
  \ my aunt while I was ok. I just wanted to live each moment intensely, to smile\
  \ for everyone on the subway, to praise the artists and to observe up close the\
  \ busy life of the locals.\nEach part enchanted me, I saw the wealth from afar,\
  \ in colossal condominiums and buildings, and the near poverty in the neighborhood\
  \ where I was. I walked the streets, always with lots of people and with children\
  \ playing at all times. I took a photo of a beautiful old car (fusca) that hid the\
  \ entrance of a sewer that passed between the houses. When I saw that, I could not\
  \ fail to capture.\nI visited the main parks of the city, the places of culture,\
  \ the \"Mercad\xE3o\" and the S\xE9 Cathedral. The Cathedral Square is the heart\
  \ of S\xE3o Paulo. Diversity lives there, and inequality also.\nThis trip opened\
  \ my mind. There were conversations on the sidewalk with simple people, but they\
  \ have a lot to say. I want to record everything and make a documentary. That's\
  \ when I noticed that journalism would be my profession.\nI ventured into the alleys,\
  \ created bonds with people that I may never see again. I was at the Sunday fair\
  \ of Vila Joaniza, very different from the fairs I was used to. It was something\
  \ so unusual that I even filmed to post on Instagram and share my happiness in being\
  \ in contact with a way of living different from mine. Being in S\xE3o Paulo inspired\
  \ me to make a difference in society and through journalism show the hidden places\
  \ on the maps."
