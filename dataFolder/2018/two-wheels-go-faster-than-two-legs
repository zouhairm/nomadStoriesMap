Text: "The last thing I expected was to feel like a child again in my 27's.\nBut when\
  \ you have a Swiss Bohemian friend of almost 60 with his \"forever young\" attitude,\
  \ I can not feel less young than him.\nRichard lives in Brazil with his wife and\
  \ daughter. Destiny wanted us to coincide in Zurich while I was visiting my lovely\
  \ friend Sabi after a few days in Germany.\nMany of you will remember Zurich as\
  \ one of the most beautiful capitals in Europe and remembering how expensive is\
  \ public transportation, having lunch and even going to the supermarket trying to\
  \ save money. It does'n matter if you are a traveler with a low budget (I am this\
  \ kind of traveler) or with an average budget. I wanted travel to France later so\
  \ I had to be smart and take care my budget.\nRichard had not better idea than show\
  \ me the things that can be done for free (everyone loves this word) in Zurich and\
  \ in summer on a sunny day. I followed his instructions to bring a bathing suit\
  \ and a padlock.\nAfter a tea and a chat remembering the last time we saw each other\
  \ in Argentina, we went to visit Zurich. Cris (his wife) took the bus to the central\
  \ station and left me her scooter to go with Nina (his daughter) and Richard...\
  \ I fell in love with the wind in my face and the speed that it feels to move around\
  \ the city like a child 27 years old on two wheels. Do you remember your first time\
  \ riding a bike? This mix between happiness and adrenaline going throug your veins.\
  \ Something was already connected.\nAfter the ride to the central station, Richard\
  \ showed me the place where I can rent a bike to use during the day for free. I\
  \ left 20 francs as deposit and I rented the bike to go to the next free thing:\
  \ The Unterer Letten. A place on the Limmat River perfectly ready to jump into the\
  \ clear and fresh water in the middle of the city with showers, dressing rooms,\
  \ bathrooms and lockers.\nEins, zwei, drei! We all jumped into the water with a\
  \ feeling of freedom and totally for free. \nThe last thing I never expected was\
  \ feeling the urgency to buy a scooter after this first ride. I went to Lyon in\
  \ France to visit some friends and I bought one there. I went to Marseille and Nice\
  \ to test first in the cities and at the same time and having fun with some adrenaline.\
  \ \nI can't live without my little pink partner, everywhere I go \"she\" comes with\
  \ me. Even for weekend trips. A beautiful thing I observed: how young and old riders\
  \ goes around Munich with a smile on those faces breaking the conservative atmosphere\
  \ on two wheels."
