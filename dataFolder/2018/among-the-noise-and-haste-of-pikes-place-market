Text: "The crowd was bustling from vendor to vendor for all sorts of things. From\
  \ clothing to produce, from fish to pastries, the market was alive with enthusiastic\
  \ vendors, artists, and mellow salespeople. All of them starting conversation with\
  \ anyone that even showed a slight interest in their booth of wonder. Being my first\
  \ time traveling, I was enamored with the buzz on the top level. So many people,\
  \ local or tourist, it didn't matter, they were here to enjoy the market, just like\
  \ me.\nI knew there was more to the market, and I needed to get a move on to see\
  \ the rest of the labyrinthine market. As I started to go below the initial street\
  \ level, past the food stalls that put themselves right next to the stairs and ramps\
  \ and bathrooms, I willed myself to get through to the second level, as I am not\
  \ a hobbit who can just have a second breakfast. The stairways were just as crowded\
  \ as the street level vendors, but with a little more flow as there wasn't as much\
  \ eye candy in the stairway as the actual shops.\nTime passed as I weaved my way\
  \ through, floor to floor, making sure I didn't miss anything that I even thought\
  \ was interesting. As I exited to market towards the piers, I looked up. The morning\
  \ had an overcast , but to see the sun, to have it add that little bit of warmth\
  \ and to have it catch the silver lining of the clouds, I couldn't help but smile.\
  \ \nWhile enjoying the sunshine and view of the Puget Sound, the smell of coffee\
  \ hit me, and my stomach reminded me that it needs attention. Walking towards the\
  \ smell, I saw a little store that sold crab burgers. Now I had a dilemma, do I\
  \ go towards Seattle's renowned coffee or renowned seafood. I decided on seafood,\
  \ and as I ate the \"world's best\" crab burger(and it was definitely delicious)\
  \ on a bench overlooking the Islands out on the Puget Sound, I smiled again at a\
  \ thought that popped into my head: this is nice, and I can't wait to tell people."
