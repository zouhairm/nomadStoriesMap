Text: "Once my friend Michelle and I were driving East from California. We took I-80,\
  \ which goes through the desolate, remote reaches of Nevada, Utah, and Wyoming.\
  \ To return to Colorado that way takes seventeen hours. When we sped into Utah,\
  \ it was already late afternoon.\nThe Bonneville Salt Flats sit at the Utah-Nevada\
  \ border. Nothing could have prepared me for the absolute otherworldliness that\
  \ pervades this vast, flat plane. The ancient salt deposits, completely white, are\
  \ from what used to be a lake, during the Pleistocene. On the edge of the basin\
  \ sit a few low mountains. In the bleak sunlight, a few clouds hovered above the\
  \ peaks. Cutting through the expanse is the Interstate. There is no human habitation.\
  \  \nAs we sped into this liminal landscape, Michelle pointed out at the horizon\
  \ from behind the steering wheel. \u201CLook!\u201D she said, breaking our long\
  \ silence. I looked more closely into the distance and noticed something: there\
  \ was a mirage ringing the horizon, erasing the distinction between land and sky.\
  \ The clouds and the salt looked like they were falling into each other. \nIt was\
  \ a moment that bore some kind of inexpressible meaning. I could feel that, between\
  \ Michelle and I, there was a deep understanding that we had stumbled into a realm\
  \ of the earth that is eternal and lonely, beyond memory. Never before in my life\
  \ had I shared a moment like this with anyone. \u201CShould we stop?\u201D Michelle\
  \ asked me. I assented immediately, and we pulled her lurching SUV onto the shoulder,\
  \ crossing the rumble strip unceremoniously as we slowed. We grabbed our jackets\
  \ and jumped into the desert.\nIt was cold. There were no other cars. We ran across\
  \ the median. Then we stood a few moments on the cold ground, soft with old rain.\
  \ Hubcaps and bits of rubber lay forlornly on the plane.  I read once that this\
  \ was the place where the Craig Breedlove had broken the world speed record in a\
  \ jet-powered car. This place was ideal for it. No obstacles, the salt provided\
  \ perfect traction, superb visibility. Yet for some reason I couldn\u2019t square\
  \ the feeling of speed with the stillness. \nMichelle and I stood for a while, enraptured.\
  \ I had an impulse to say something. But to speak would be to ruin.\nWe ran back\
  \ across the road and got back in the car. When it was safe we got up to speed and\
  \ continued on our way. Michelle spoke. \u201CWe just saw something completely unreal,\u201D\
  \ she stated distantly. I agreed. To the sound of tires on pavement, we fell silent\
  \ again. There was a long way to go."
