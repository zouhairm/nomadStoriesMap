Text: "Panicked Chinese Faces is what I saw the moment I got off from Bar stock exchange,\
  \ a nightclub located by linking road. It was kind of amusing as well as kind of\
  \ sympathetic to see these Chinese having a nightmare riding in a typical auto-rickshaw,\
  \ It was pretty obvious that these guys were off on a drunk adventure. Although\
  \ linking road has one of the most lavish suburban nightlife, it's still known for\
  \ it's shopping. It's probably because of the mingled up experience you get amidst\
  \ streetside shops and international brands. I walked on these streets for hours,\
  \ paddling shops to shops bargaining my way through shopkeepers until they gave\
  \ up. I was being trained to bargain with these Marwari shopkeepers just the night\
  \ before, glad I took those classes.\n \nNext day's hungover got me even more excited.\
  \ Part of it is maybe because of all the crazy vibes, and by crazy I mean Bollywood.\
  \ Mumbai without Bollywood nights is exactly like burger without french fries. I\
  \ remember getting drunk with strangers, having a Bollywood dance-off with Italian\
  \ guys and finally giving myself some rest at Juhu beach around 5'o. Mumbai certainly\
  \ is a city which never sleeps.\nI thought of making my Sunday as sober as possible.\
  \ So my friend opened a bottle of wine. We sat down by carter's road and enjoyed\
  \ a fine sunset by the bay. The one good thing about Mumbai is that you never run\
  \ out of places to go, there are many hill station like Khandala and Lonavla within\
  \ 30 miles.\n\nBut it's not the nightlife, shopping or the food which makes it a\
  \ great place, but the people itself. It was as if every random guy that I came\
  \ across was the nicest. Mumbaikars are one of the greatest storytellers all across\
  \ the globe. It was amazing for me to just listen to a Vada-Paav seller the story\
  \ of his life in just 5 minutes! It's 22 million people stuffed inside a city half\
  \ the size of London, why won't their stories be amazing?  Yes, Mumbai is a noisy,\
  \ crowdy, chaotic place; but you know what, amongst all the chaos, it still feels\
  \ safe. It feels like Home. I was certainly hooked up with Mumbai at once.\nMumbai\
  \ is not just a city, but an emotion."
