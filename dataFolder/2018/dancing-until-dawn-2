Text: "\u201CRight gang, all 18 of us will sleep on the floor above the classrooms.\
  \ There's a cold bucket shower and one traditional Asian toilet which is also used\
  \ by the kids. Bring bug spray and toilet roll. Oh and there's no wifi.\u201D\n\n\
  17 faces gawp back, talk about no home comforts. With a chance to see rural Cambodia,\
  \ live like locals and ultimately give something back, excitement soon replaced\
  \ apprehension. \n\nWe arrive at \u201CMy Grandfather's Place\u201D our new home.\
  \ It's a stark contrast to the bedlam of Siem Reap where tuktuks come from every\
  \ direction, beer is cheaper than water and sellers promise \u201CMiss, good price\
  \ for you\u201D. There is a sense of serenity; children bathe in the river, elders\
  \ prepare food and the wind whistles among the palm trees.\n\nAs we step off the\
  \ chilled bus into escapable heat, kids run over grabbing our hands and jumping\
  \ on our backs shouting \u201CTeacher, your name?\u201D Through their infectious\
  \ excitement I spot a small child hugging a climbing frame. Unlike the others, this\
  \ little one stays back, eyes transfixed on everything and everyone. Short hair,\
  \ dirty ripped trousers, rounding belly, the child is beautiful. \n\n\u201CHer name\
  \ is Dun\u201D a local tells me. I smile gratefully, blushing slightly at being\
  \ caught staring.\n\nAt four o'clock the next morning we sleepily attend a celebration\
  \ of the deceased. As the monks' chants echo the temple grounds we lay rice balls\
  \ and sprinkle water in memory of lost loved ones and pray for those still with\
  \ us. I am humbled. As I take a moment to reflect on the privilege of being invited\
  \ into such a sacred moment, I am startled as music bellows out of nowhere.\n\n\
  I follow the sound to find what can only be described as a temple rave. From age\
  \ three to 83 people are dancing round a speaker atop a small table. Before long\
  \ I am being pushed and pulled every which way. \n\nI look for Dun. She isn't there.\n\
  \nChildren I will be teaching in a few hours weave through the crowd, a grandmother\
  \ grabs my hand whenever I turn my attention elsewhere, a young mum hands me her\
  \ baby and an elderly man with no teeth sneaks me a wink. It is as chaotic as it\
  \ is joyful. \n\nDespite many attempts to stop me, I escape the circle breathless\
  \ and dripping in sweat.  As I quench my thirst I feel a tug on my t-shirt. I look\
  \ down and see Dun break into a toothless smile. I smile back and she takes my hand.\
  \  Without objection I lose myself in the uproar as the crowd swallows me. Once\
  \ again I am one of them and we dance until the sunrise calls us back to school."
