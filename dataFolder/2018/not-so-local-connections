Text: "I can still summon the taste of my wayward tears blended with sips of Imperial\
  \ as Maynor and I chain smoked in unison on a porch in Guanacaste, Costa Rica last\
  \ summer. He announced, \u201CWhen you grow up without roots, you end up constantly\
  \ searching for them.\u201D\n\nI didn\u2019t seem to notice the weathered plastic\
  \ chairs, the yapping chihuahua, or the vampiric mosquitoes the way I did when I\u2019\
  d first arrived. On this night, I felt seen - reflected in the eyes of the loving\
  \ Nicaraguan man who sat across from me. Maynor is meaty. Meaty people are the ones\
  \ that allow you access to their guts with little emotional tugging. An hour into\
  \ meeting one another, we were sprawled out on the living room floor sharing fragile\
  \ memories and exchanging wisdom we\u2019d had to suffer to receive.\n\nInitially,\
  \ it felt contrary to opt for a Nicaraguan Couchsurfing host in Costa Rica, but\
  \ Maynor presented Coco Beach with the wisdom and care of a resident who\u2019d\
  \ long explored its people and natural riches. One day he said, \u201CI\u2019d like\
  \ to show you Penca Beach.\u201D\n\nPenca beach wasn\u2019t commercially groomed,\
  \ it was nearly deserted and perfect in its feral quality.\n\nMaynor was open but\
  \ left a lot of space where words weren\u2019t needed. This perplexed me because\
  \ I've become accustomed to a society that fills silences with empty banter. I\u2019\
  d learn to appreciate the wordless conversations we shared on these little voyages.\n\
  \nMaynor looked at me and said, \u201CYou can take a bath now,\u201D and silently\
  \ sat on a log far from shore. I knew he meant I could take a swim, but what confused\
  \ me was that he didn\u2019t attempt to join me or give me any instruction. There\
  \ was no, \u201CYou have 20 minutes until dinner,\u201D or some timely declaration\
  \ of purpose. He didn\u2019t have phone service or anything to distract himself.\n\
  \nIt hit me - he only brought me there so I could experience something beautiful.\
  \ There were no strings or romantic motivations.\n\nI don\u2019t know how long I\
  \ was in that water, but it remains one of the most meditative experiences in my\
  \ memory. Maynor would take me diving, show me hidden waterfalls, and cook for me,\
  \ but it was his silent offerings that moved me the most. On that final night, he\
  \ shared the pained story of his life, a story of suffering that is his to tell,\
  \ a biography in stark contrast to love he continues to give to others. I sobbed\
  \ that night, sad to leave his peaceful presence, angered by what he\u2019s had\
  \ to endure in this life, but so indebted for the reminder that individuals like\
  \ him survive in this world."
