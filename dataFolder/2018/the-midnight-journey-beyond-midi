Text: "The summer French course was over and I left the silent medieval town that\
  \ was suffocated by the August heat of the French region of Midi \u2013 the word\
  \ which means \u2018midday\u2019 \u2013 and ready to revive again every night until\
  \ the morning flames play on its facades. \n\nI lived each and every night together\
  \ with the town of Montpellier and someone I made friends with, an inspired soulmate\
  \ who influenced me so much without even knowing it.\n\nI was drinking ros\xE9,\
  \ staying hungry and bathing topless. I was trying to speak French, trying oysters,\
  \ and trying out how it was to behave French: with confidence, simplicity and a\
  \ very free spirit. \n\nIt was another midnight after a riotous evening feast, when\
  \ we were walking along the futuristic Esplanade de l\u2019Europe, in the wind corridor\
  \ with fountains in the middle turned off, their water not yet dried and intact\
  \ as a huge mirror on the pavement.  Thousands of crazy green parrots were crying\
  \ out loud and nothing else, except the wild, echoing sound remained. So exotic\
  \ it felt, I was bedazzled, on my own journey to the center of the earth, when I\
  \ heard him say: \n\n\xAB When I went to Syria, I knew no one, and had limited opportunities\
  \ to make local connections. I was studying Arabic at that time and I forced myself\
  \ to talk Arab to myself every evening before going to bed, to quietly re-tell the\
  \ stories of the day, to re-play the dialogues I sneaked. I had no other interlocutor\
  \ than me. Do this, when you are back, and when you no longer have a chance to practice.\
  \ \xBB\n\nIt seemed unattainable. This whole Mediterranean journey I was marching\
  \ on the sand of my dreams, not leaving myself a grain of thought that one day I\
  \ could make it closer, master my French, and not just pretend \u2018Frenchness\u2019\
  , but really be a part of this world. \n\nHis words somehow stayed there with me,\
  \ forging a decision that would get me on a much longer personal quest. Watching\
  \ the dozing morning town from a train window, I was on my way back to Russia, awake,\
  \ determined in my inner motion.\n\nOne year later, I would enter a blank white\
  \ room that would become my first home in France. The airline would lose all of\
  \ my luggage, and I would only have courage and new dreams to arrange on the empty\
  \ shelves."
