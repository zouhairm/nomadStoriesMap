Text: "Festive music welcomed us as we arrived outside the walls of Kotor, Montenegro.\
  \ We were still shaking our awe away from the views we had experienced of the bay.\
  \ We looked up to the mountains behind the city and I found what I knew was our\
  \ final destination: St. John\u2019s Castle.\nWe navigated through the city, avoiding\
  \ the disguised people that frantically wandered the stone-paved narrow streets.\
  \ It seemed as if we had suddenly landed in one of Lewis Carroll\u2019s wildest\
  \ dreams. I asked Katherine to follow me, with the excuse of finding an amazing\
  \ vantage point up the mountain. She paused and hesitated, reluctantly accepting.\n\
  We left all the unexpected hassle behind and started our way up. Not a single tourist\
  \ around, except for us. Breathing heavily, we got to the Church of Our Lady of\
  \ Remedy, our first stop. The silence was entrancing and it was only broken by bursts\
  \ of music. Oh, and by our breaths... It was definitely a steep staircase.\n\u201C\
  Are we there already?\u201D Kat asked, impatiently. I could tell she wanted to go\
  \ back to the city. \u201CNot yet,\u201D I answered. She did not know it back then,\
  \ but I had arranged for her \u201Cbestie\u201D Katryna, who she had not seen in\
  \ years, to meet us at the top.\nA few hundred meters later, a rock the size of\
  \ a fist hit the ground scarcely one meter away from us. We jumped back and looked\
  \ up. We glimpsed a cat running over the slope directly above us. Kat looked at\
  \ me, grudgingly. I grabbed her hand and urged her on.\nWe soon faced a metallic\
  \ bridge that crossed over a gap to an open gate. Next to it, a sign read: \u201C\
  Dangerous grounds. Visitors are responsible for their own well-being.\u201D \u201C\
  Certainly promising,\u201D she said. \u201CAre we done impersonating Lara Croft\
  \ already? Is it truly worth all this effort?\u201D. \u201CI promise it is. Follow\
  \ me in,\u201D I answered. Holding her temper, she did.\nOne last flight of stairs\
  \ and we reached the summit. Kat was about to kill me when she saw Katryna, sat\
  \ by a Montenegrin flag, with a far-reaching view of the bay and the city below.\
  \ \u201CI can\u2019t believe it!\u201D she shouted, melting into a hug with her\
  \ long-lost friend. And then, just then, a parade started to move through the city\
  \ streets, full of color and sound. Music, costumes, friendship\u2026 All clicked\
  \ into place.\nWhen people think of Carnival, mostly Rio or Venice are named. Still,\
  \ as unexpected as it may be, there will never be a better \u201CKarneval\u201D\
  \ than the one we witnessed from the crumbling tops of St. John, surrounded by cats,\
  \ with the sun slowly setting in front of us."
