Text: "23rd December, 12.30pm: Our college announced a weeks holiday for Christmas,\
  \ so I along with my two other friends decided to go off to the Himalayan ranges,\
  \ somewhere in Uttarakhand, India. We debated on a lot of places but couldn\u2019\
  t come out to a conclusion so packed our bags and reached the bus stand at 10 pm.\
  \ We bought the tickets from the ISBT Kashmiri Gate bus stand for Rishikesh and\
  \ we were all set to go.\n24th December, 4.30am: Reached Rishikesh and found a homestay\
  \ \u2018Hotspot\u2019 that is open 24X7, rested a bit and left to find a destination\
  \ to go further. I went back to a trekking company that has helped me earlier also\
  \ in seeking unknown adventures called \u2018Red Chillies\u2019 and this time they\
  \ offered Nagtibba, an unknown trail in Garhwal Himalayas. \n2.30pm: As I and other\
  \ friend could drive in the steep hilly areas, we hired two Activa scooters and\
  \ drove from Rishikesh to Mussoorie via Dehradun (NH 7). In between we stopped to\
  \ eat some of the best Maggies made at the nukkad stalls and shopped at the flea\
  \ market, Mussoorie. Around 7pm we finally stopped at Kempty falls after 95km and\
  \ took a local stay in for the night. In hilly areas, local homestays, are the best!\
  \ \n25th December, 7 am: Next morning after eating homemade aloo paratha for breakfast,\
  \ we moved forward to Panthwari village, the starting point of the trek. In between\
  \ we stopped at Nainbagh to buy the locally made whiskey sold in the area called\
  \ \u2018Sikkim XXX\u2019 for the night. Around 3pm, we reached Panthwari\u2019s\
  \ main market. We booked a local trekking company that provided us tent, food and\
  \ guide for real cheap. The guide told us a shortcut till where we could drive our\
  \ scooters, the jaitwan gaon. The road was narrow and unconstructed, so if you weren\u2019\
  t good at riding you would trek for 3km. \nWe started our trek from jaitwan gaon,\
  \ following the arrows marked on the stones, every km, for the directions till Khaitan,\
  \ the base camp. It a steep hilly trek so one needs to be hydrated. After reaching\
  \ the base, we set up our tents and the locals cooked us food and lit up the bonfire\
  \ for the night. It was ethereal, watching the constellations and the night sky\
  \ that is hardly visible in the city sky.\n26th December, 8 am: We trekked 4km from\
  \ Khaitan to the Nag Devta temple, an ancient temple of local deities. After praying,\
  \ we started climbing up a steep hill (0.5km) covered under the clouds to look upon\
  \ the most beautiful Himalayan ranges covered in snow. This was heaven, beautiful\
  \ and weightless."
