Text: "Quality and access to care for vulnerable populations is my passion. I have\
  \ had the opportunity to examine acute and long term health and residential care\
  \ settings across the US and the Caribbean. Each time I return home wondering why\
  \ we do not offer the quality of care I have seen in less developed countries. \
  \ \nA visit to a new continuing care development just outside the \"best city in\
  \ the world\"  left me wondering just what I would find. At first glance, the grounds\
  \ and buildings appeared to be well designed and maintained and the staff welcoming\
  \ and knowledgeable. But, the impression I came away with was the result of watching\
  \ the interaction of staff with the residents, the expression on the faces of the\
  \ residents as they received services, a hug, or just acknowledgement.Smiles were\
  \ catching.Days later I watched as people from outlying areas marched miles into\
  \ the town of San Miguel de Allende in the mid day heat to celebrate Semana Santa.\
  \ The procession included the young, old, the able bodied, and the challenged. No\
  \ one was left out.  \nA decade earlier I became friends with a family living near\
  \ the Belize-Guatemala border. I was invited to visit a clinic they supported. A\
  \ clearing in the densely wooded road revealed a turquoise building. Hiding in the\
  \ center of the painted concrete blocks was an open air cathedral. Services for\
  \ the sick and the well villagers were daily at noon. Later, I learned my friends\
  \ had created a diverse, environmentally conscious, and community aware business.\
  \ Aside from livestock, one son was in charge of milk production that included selling\
  \ to his brother who made and sold cheese. The family donated beef, cheese, and\
  \ milk to the local nursing home that had its own business- selling eggs the residents\
  \ collected. Where did the caring, cooperation, and productivity come from? Is there\
  \ a cultural connection?\n Recently, I observed similar ingenuity, productivity,\
  \ and inclusion in the Andean region of Peru. One woman with the desire to preserve\
  \ the weaving tradition developed a co-op where older weavers teach the younger\
  \ women who, then, become self sufficient while making unique artistic and economic\
  \ contributions to the community. Weaving, a traditional role for the women, has\
  \ become the seed of economic development bringing generations together in support\
  \ of family and community. \n The opportunity to document day to day life and experiences\
  \ through travel writing may help answer whether that connection can be \"imported\"\
