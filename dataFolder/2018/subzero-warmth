Text: "\u201CYou know I\u2019ve never been one for the cold right?\u201D\nI peeked\
  \ out from the cave of my sub-zero sleeping bag, only to be frightened off by the\
  \ frigidly cold temperatures. For some time, I continued complaining.\nMy travel\
  \ guide spoke up amidst my penguin-like squawking and silenced me, \u201CYou won\u2019\
  t be saying that after you\u2019re outside.\u201D\nI pondered the action for a few\
  \ seconds. Would it really be worth leaving the somewhat warm place I was calling\
  \ home for the night?\n\u201CMaybe after the sun is out,\u201D I piped up and assumed\
  \ position in my cave.\n\u201CYou would miss It though.\u201D\nThis peaked my curiosity\
  \ and I thought to myself, \u201CMaybe \u2018It\u2019 (whatever It was), would be\
  \ worth the struggle.\u201D\nSo I made a decision.\nMy face popped out of the depths\
  \ of my sleeping bag again. The breath of Antarctic air hit me dead on. Nonetheless,\
  \ I let my skin adjust to this new environment around me. It was still dark in my\
  \ tent and hard to comprehend anything other than shapes.\nDaring as I was, I quickly\
  \ reached my arm out and felt around for all my clothing to get dressed in what\
  \ little warmth I had left. After bundling up, I took the last step by unzipping\
  \ my cave and sitting on the floor.\nI heard the much too eager sound of my guide,\
  \ \u201CHurry up! You'll miss It if you take too long!\u201D\nI scoffed as I fumbled\
  \ with my snow boots in the still dark tent. I felt the cold back off a bit as my\
  \ body adjusted. Indistinct penguin chatter was occurring from somewhere in the\
  \ distance.\nPicking up my old digital watch off my tent floor, I read the time.\
  \ Its dim light told me it was 4:25 A.M. I was appalled by how early I had been\
  \ awoken, but I unzipped my tent door.\nDespite the wall of subzero wind accompanying\
  \ my exit, I managed to stand up outside of my tent. I saw my guide a few feet away\
  \ and met him.\n\u201CAre you ready?\u201D He asked me in an ominous tone.\n\u201C\
  I guess,\u201D I replied groggily, rubbing my eyes.\nJust then, the landscape began\
  \ igniting with colors I had never dreamed possible. Reds, oranges, blues, and whites\
  \ coming together to display a masterpiece of nature; transcending anything a human\
  \ could create. The movement of the sun elevating in the sky continued arousing\
  \ new bursts of light that could put any fireworks to shame. It was truly a spectacle\
  \ I was lucky to see.\nWarm hues of the sun\u2019s rays glinted off the glacial\
  \ walls in the distance so profoundly. The ocean before us created a dark contrast\
  \ of flame and water. The chill around me evaporated.\nI\u2019ve never been one\
  \ for the cold; but the world was on fire."
