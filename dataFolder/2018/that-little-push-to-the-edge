Text: 'It is often said that sometimes it takes a little push to get out of the ordinary.
  To make things happen. I have seen that this may not be a matter of "sometimes",
  but of "almost always" - it''s almost always necessary this little fright. It''s
  that little push that leaves us on the edge of the abyss - but that doesn''t throw
  us down there.


  For me, it came today, with the cancellation of a work trip that I would do for
  Berlin. For years I''ve been waiting for such an opportunity. It never came. But
  it decided to knock on the door unexpectedly last week with an invitation from the
  brazilian Tourism Ministry to cover a fair in Germany. With the same surprise that
  came, however, it went away as well: due to scheduling problems, the invitation
  had been canceled.


  It was frustrating to go through all this, to feel it al. But what struck first
  as frustration became fuel - it was the little shove from the edge of the abyss.
  Full of ideas and desires, it was time to look for a way for this chance to seek
  me again. Or, who knows, to seek for it myself: after turning around the abyss,
  how about concentrating the energy in the hands and eyes on the computer?


  I got here. A new opportunity. And it would look even better: with the chance not
  only of working, but of learning more deeply. As they say here in Brazil about opportunities,
  "grab and go". I came and I''m here: ready for this time to jump and see what the
  other side of this cliff, now Argentina, can reveal to those who are willing to
  surpass it. Goodbye Berlin. Hello Buenos Aires!'
