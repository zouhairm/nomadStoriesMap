Text: "I was tricked, subdued, enslaved. It was the last thing I expected on that\
  \ day of April when I hit the road to Spain, ready to spend no less than 5 months\
  \ abroad, in Valencia. Those of you who have never reached this world patch, start\
  \ by forging in your mind the Creator waking up in the morning, pouring some coffee\
  \ and thinking: \u201EWhat is it there in the bag for this Mediterranean land? Let\u2019\
  s give it a certain air, a little something that cannot be photographed but inhaled,\
  \ and when exhaled, would thirst them as if drinking from the salty sea.\u201D\n\
  \nHe spread out oranges hanging freely on the streets, lifted palms and their perpetual\
  \ holiday atmosphere, sculpting amazing beaches, gorgeous bodies arching in a volleyball\
  \ dance, smoothie bars, and all the trimmings. \n\nThe final thing he took out of\
  \ the bag was the Valencians... How shall I faultlessly describe them? Let's just\
  \ say that an ordinary foreigner cannot simply step out of a vegetable shop without\
  \ listening to Wikipedian descriptions of each and every product, along with a must-have\
  \ recipe for \u201Calcachofas a la plancha\u201D. If you are wise enough, you just\
  \ don't ask for directions when in a hurry. Otherwise, you are taking the risk of\
  \ being personally guided, unable to resist the temptation of hearing a life story\
  \ while offering yours in exchange. Try feeling alone among these people. Good luck!\n\
  \nCan you see how easily Valencia dominated my senses, charmed me deeper than any\
  \ place, man, book or night of love? I fell into a trap, but the city was still\
  \ not satisfied. It decided to shackle me irrecoverably, guiding my steps toward\
  \ the Buddhist Center and nourished me with souvenirs like tattoos painted in my\
  \ memory for at least 10 lives from now. \n\nIt was during that very first meditation\
  \ class when I found out that thoughts are just like clouds in the blue sky, taking\
  \ shape only to dispel in minutes, clouds that have no substance. That I was not\
  \ what I thought, nor my values, neither the wishes I was made of because \u201E\
  me\u201D, the person I knew, didn\u2019t exist. That the wind touching my skin was\
  \ infinitely more real compared to what my poor mind hoped would happen in 1 year,\
  \ 1 month, 1 minute. Those chanted mantras were the ones that calmed my spirit and\
  \ Buddha\u2019s words, spelled in Spanish, the ones piercing my ear as they were\
  \ answering my entire life's questions. \n\nThe last thing I expected was to irredeemably\
  \ fall in love with every cm2 of Valencia and even more, with each cm2 of myself\
  \ living within its borders."
