Text: "\u201CIf something happens and we survive, we are going to need our passports\
  \ to get home,\u201D I hissed at my boyfriend as I stuffed mine into my bra. He\
  \ handed his over, eyeing the AK-47 hovering in front of his nose, pointing out\
  \ of the bus window. The East African Monday edition that we had picked up with\
  \ the armed guards was folded in his lap; the headline, \u201CThe Killer Road From\
  \ Kigoma\u201D above a photo of a waylaid bus. \n\nI had thought that everything\
  \ was unusually quiet when we boarded in pre-dawn Kigoma. The laughing women, the\
  \ throng of children and the squawking chickens that usually filled Tanzanian buses\
  \ were conspicuously absent. The fact that the day prior bandits had hijacked a\
  \ bus on our route and murdered four people was the last thing I expected.\n\nWe\
  \ had travelled to Kigoma on the western border of Tanzania to see Jane Goodall\u2019\
  s chimps. Gombe Stream national park is home to 90 chimpanzees who have been the\
  \ subjects of nearly 60 years of study. Ethological research has allowed Goodall\
  \ and her colleagues to unpicked the complex characters of chimpanzees: describing\
  \ their intelligence and playfulness, but also their coordinated violence. The family\
  \ of seven adults we saw reclining in the cool twilight of the scrub, were only\
  \ interested in hunting lice. They regarded us wearily with deep-set eyes and gently\
  \ chided their infants when they got too close. \n\nThe evening after our encounter\
  \ with the chimps, I stood on the mouldering jetty in the national park looking\
  \ out across Lake Tanganyika. On the other side, beyond the streaky sunset, was\
  \ the Democratic Republic of Congo: home of our other closest relative, Bonobos.\
  \ They are separated from chimpanzees by the slimmest of species barriers but socially\
  \ they are miles apart. Bonobos settle strife with sex; they make love, not war.\
  \ \n\nSitting on the bus with the machine gun bobbing in front of my nose, I remembered\
  \ standing on the edge of the lake between our estranged cousins; the chimps on\
  \ one side, bonobos on the other. At what point in our eight million year journey\
  \ from common ancestor to modern man had we turned onto a road that lead to armed\
  \ guards on a public bus and murder for loot? What would the world be like today\
  \ if we were a little more Bonobo and a little less chimp? I leaned my face against\
  \ the shuddering glass, the passports digging into my chest, and watched the killer\
  \ road slide by."
