Text: "For weeks I have pondered over a story I could create. My mind has wondered\
  \ down themes of guerrilla warfare in Afganistan and tragedy in the outback. However,\
  \ it came to me now as I sit in my flat in London and gaze out at this glum February\
  \ day, that perhaps the best thing to do is to write a true story.\nThis story takes\
  \ place on a bus in India. I boarded an overnight bus from Delhi and was forced\
  \ to sit on the back row. I tried to sit nearer the front so I could recline easier\
  \ and got threatened by the bus driver that if I didn\u2019t sit where he said I\
  \ would be thrown off the bus. I spent the first part of the journey glaring out\
  \ of the window with a furrowed brow and salty expression. By this point I had been\
  \ travelling around India for four months so I was accustomed to the Indian take-no-shit-from-no-one\
  \ manner. I had previously got many modes of transport and picked up some tips along\
  \ the way. I had slept on sleeper trains; always get the top bunk so that you can\
  \ avoid random members of Indian families who had booked one bed for six people\
  \ snuggling in with you. And I had got plenty of sleeper buses; ALWAYS go to the\
  \ toilet before you get on the sleeper bus because the driver WILL NOT stop for\
  \ anyone (flashbacks to myself squatting on all fours over a bottle behind the privacy\
  \ of a very thin curtain. The sound of my pee hitting the bottom of the plastic\
  \ bottle and echoing loudly through the bus still haunts me).\nAnyway, back to the\
  \ story. After fours hours of cramping and falling off of my seat at the back of\
  \ the bus, we stopped for a break. An Indian woman, dressed in a traditional Sari\
  \ approached me and although she did not speak English we smiled and laughed and\
  \ said \u201Chello\u201D quite a few times. She stroked my blonde hair (as many\
  \ Indian people did during my trip) and then we parted ways. When I again boarded\
  \ the bus with a look of pure thunder on my face. I was shocked to see the Indian\
  \ woman sitting in my place at the back of the bus. Was she hoping to share my seat?\
  \ There was hardly enough room for one of me let alone a friendly lady too. She\
  \ was smiling at me as I walked on, was she mocking me? Was I going to have to go\
  \ against every British instinct in my body and tell her to move? Then she started\
  \ gesturing to a seat at the front by the window. She had an angry look on her face\
  \ and was doing a crazy hand gesture telling me to go back and sit. I did as I was\
  \ told and sat in the seat by the window next to a small man with a moustache.\n\
  \u201CShe swap with you\u201D said the passenger to my right."
