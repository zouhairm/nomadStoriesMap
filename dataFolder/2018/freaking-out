Text: "My eyes snap open. My heart hammers against my throat. The night is soundless,\
  \ but something has woken me up. Lying deathly still in my hammock, I strain my\
  \ ears. Nothing. But I can sense something is close: watching, waiting, hiding.\
  \ \n\n\u201CEnough,\u201D I tell myself, \u201Cstop being such a child.\u201D I\
  \ slide my hand to the top of the sweatshirt I am using as a pillow, where I know\
  \ my headlamp is. Before I can think better of it, I press the light on. Scraaatch!\
  \ I click the light off, breathless. I yank my sleeping bag up over my face. I try\
  \ hard not to breathe.  \n\nThe sound was definitely too loud to be an animal. A\
  \ person must be lurking nearby. Maybe a murderer lives in the decrepit little shack\
  \ we walked past on our way to the cave, only fifty metres away. Or maybe they live\
  \ in the damp and ominous cave. This isolated freedom camping spot would be the\
  \ perfect spot to murder someone and get away with it. I wonder if I am going crazy;\
  \ I have heard that people can go crazy when they are out in the bush. \n\nWhat\
  \ feels like an hour later, I whisper \u201CAl\u201D to the hammock beside me. I\
  \ receive a grunt and a shuffle in response. I wish I were asleep too. I wish it\
  \ were morning already. I wish I were at home in my bed, in my locked house. I desperately\
  \ need to pee. \n\nBravely, I float my legs into the open air and my feet find the\
  \ ground. Positioning the headlamp on my forehead, I boldly switch the light on.\
  \ Carefully, I creep along the narrow dirt path to the toilet block. A possum laughs\
  \ and I almost trip. Feigning authority, I shine light in its direction. \u201C\
  Was it you who woke me up, little possum?\u201D I chuckle. It glares at me, unamused.\
  \ Do possums attack? I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve read somewhere that they can be vicious\
  \ when they want to be. I sprint the rest of the way to the toilet block. \n\nBack\
  \ in my hammock, I snuggle into my sleeping bag; proud of the dangers I\u2019ve\
  \ overcome. A mosquito crawls up my leg. Or is it a spider? Are there poisonous\
  \ spiders in New Zealand? I can\u2019t remember. \n\nSoft light lures my eyes open.\
  \ Mildew and bark fill my lungs. The early morning vibrates with the chirp of cicadas.\
  \ Lazily, I turn to look at Al, stretched out in his hammock. \u201CGood sleep?\u201D\
  \ he yawns, \u201CNothing like sleeping in nature, is there?\u201D I smile to myself,\
  \ \u201CI agree, nothing like it. I\u2019m so glad we decided to sleep in hammocks.\
  \ I slept like a log.\u201D"
