Text: "The overcrowded ferry chugged across the Chao Praya River, that main watery\
  \ artery of Bangkok, Thailand. Forced against the handrail, I squinted through the\
  \ thin smog at my final destination. \nThe day of temple-chasing had led me from\
  \ The Grand Palace down to Wat Pho and the giant, reclining Buddha. Last was the\
  \ Temple of Dawn, Wat Arun, its main spire rising faintly from the surrounding complex.\n\
  Passing ornate long tail boats, transporting tourists with deeper pockets than mine,\
  \ the ferry docked with a jolt and the conductor's piercing whistle. I brushed through\
  \ our crowd, past two giant demon guards, their upturned tusks protruding from snarling\
  \ grimaces. Past rows of Buddhas, I proceeded to the main attraction, that postcard\
  \ landmark I had descried from across the river. \nI wish I could talk about how\
  \ ethereal the grand temple appeared before me in its quintessential Khmer architecture.\
  \ How I climbed from the base to the top, ascending the three symbolic levels of\
  \ enlightenment inherent in its design, until I reached the Trident of Shiva and\
  \ looked out upon the river and its temples for that requisite photo-op.\nI wish\
  \ I could. But sometimes, when you go to look at what the past has preserved, it's\
  \ in the act of being preserved. Wat Arun was roped off, enshrouded in canvassed\
  \ scaffolding.\nDejected, I circled the base of the monument and smelled food. I\
  \ was expecting carts hocking Pad Thai. Instead, I came upon locals gathered around\
  \ a buffet table smorgasbord. A woman with a covered plate noticed me.\n\"Sawat\
  \ dee krab,\" I said, bowing.\n\"Sawat dee krab,\" she smiled. \"You like some food?\"\
  \n\"Sure,\" I said. \"How much?\"\n\"Not for sale,\" she said. \"This is our family.\
  \ Today we eat the favorite foods of our ancestors\"\nI had crashed a family reunion.\
  \ Looking around, I guessed that there were at least 4 generations represented.\
  \ \nMy sunburned face flushed even redder. \"No, excuse me-\"\n\"Please,\" she said,\
  \ \u201Djoin our family. You call me Ba.\u201D\nBa sat me down in a plastic chair,\
  \ addressing the entire family in Thai. \u201CSawat dee Krab\u201D\u2019s rang out\
  \ as everyone smiled and bowed to me with folded hands. They brought me myriad curries,\
  \ fried rice and squid egg custards, insisting I must try \u201Cone of everything!\u201D\
  \nI glanced up at Wat Arun in its veil. In all my frustration of not being able\
  \ to climb up it, up to the topmost layer of the Devaphum \"realm of happiness,\"\
  \ I realized that, in fact, I actually had. It was here, with this family, filling\
  \ this stranger\u2019s belly and his heart."
