Text: "The morning of March 25th, I laid still in bed from horrible body aches that\
  \ left me feeling almost paralyzed. \"My small sister\" my Kenyan coworker shouted\
  \ as he came into my hotel room, \"You are a strong girl, get up\". He was right,\
  \ I was usually pretty tough but on this particular day I was experiencing a pain\
  \ like I had never known. Between continuous bouts of racing to the bathroom, night\
  \ sweats, shivering and sharp muscle spasms whenever I moved, I feared I was going\
  \ to die. My coworker eventually returned to work to inform the others I was sick.\
  \ Someone showed up from the office with an at home malaria test kit and almost\
  \ instantly we had our diagnosis. I laid in bed rehydrating and trying to eat enough\
  \ food so I could take my medication without my stomach feeling like a dryer filled\
  \ with gym shoes. While in that small hotel room, located in the busiest part of\
  \ Monrovia, I thought a lot about my own innocence and naivete regarding this trip,\
  \ how I assumed that armed with a newly acquired environmental health masters degree\
  \ that I could take on one of the biggest epidemics in mankind's history. \n\nLying\
  \ in bed in my medicated haze, I began to reflect on the moment I arrived in Liberia.\
  \ I stood in line with all of the passengers awaiting entry from the tarmac in to\
  \ the airport terminal. A guard dressed from head to toe in personal protective\
  \ equipment walked by each of us with a temperature gun to ensure that no one with\
  \ a fever or visible signs of illness entered the country. Once inside, I grabbed\
  \ my bags, walked out into the moist warm city air, past the taxi men yelling in\
  \ my direction, car horns honking, and towards the two smiling faces holding up\
  \ a sign with my name on it. I was surprised to find two other employees from within\
  \ my organization would be sharing the ride to our home base. One of the employees\
  \ was returning and one was a new hire so we spent the entire car ride discussing\
  \ critical safety issues. The long timer impressed upon us that anytime we step\
  \ out into a public space we are at risk for contracting Ebola. He informed us of\
  \ the dangers of consuming any food that contained bush meat, a known carrier of\
  \ the virus. Most importantly, he cautioned us to quickly retreat if we encountered\
  \ someone showing signs and symptoms of the illness or hysteria. The conversation\
  \ took me from the theoretical to the experiential, the risk was palpable."
