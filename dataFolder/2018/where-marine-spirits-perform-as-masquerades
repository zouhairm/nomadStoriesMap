Text: "Buguma in Kalabari is a developing town that has lost its African village setting,\
  \ due to the erosion rupturing African villages called western civilisation, but\
  \ certainly not its cultures and traditions. \n\nOwu Aru Sun festival is held every\
  \ twenty years, with marine spirits prying as masquerades. \n \nThe people have\
  \ fishing as their primordial enterprise while living on 23 islands and are known\
  \ as travelers. In many quarters, it is believed that they travel a lot having been\
  \ part of the first sets of Africans that were exposed to the colonial Europeans.\
  \ \n\nBy the 15th Century, we learnt that their traders meddled for Africa and the\
  \ West in many businesses, but principally in the cause of slave trade. \n\nStructure\
  \ In Buguma\nThese people known as Ijaw speaking hold their cultures and traditions\
  \ so dearly to their hearts, as they relish their love for the Owu Aru Sun festival\
  \ known as the epicenter, where all masquerades and families and groups showcase\
  \ their dance steps. \n\nThe people are partitioned into what is recognised as \u201C\
  War Canoe Houses\u201D. They live in creeks, and have connections with terrestrial\
  \ and spiritual beings having mutual understanding and communications with them.\
  \ These Beings, we are told, are invited as guests and performers during festivals,\
  \ such as the one we are in attendance. \n\nMarine Spirits Play As Masquerades\n\
  The engaging aspect of the Owu Aru Sun festival is that it is not like many African\
  \ cultures and traditions that have been reduced to mere costume appearances: The\
  \ festival upholds the spiritual aspect with marine spirits prying as masquerades.\
  \ \n\nWe see masquerades\u2019 and the natives\u2019 attractive dance steps tied\
  \ with thrust and pageantry. Each family and group showcase their royal and native\
  \ ceremonial dress and objects; and some families present their virgins, who appear\
  \ topless, as custom demands, before the prying eyes of spectators.   \n\nThere\
  \ is the Alagba Masquerade staged by the Ekine Sekiapu Society. This masquerade\
  \ is said, it must be played before any masquerade will. It is played to dish in\
  \ the f\xEAte of the Owu Aru Sun festival. \n\nA document presented by Sokari Douglas\
  \ Camp of Kalabari, says, \u201CAlagba is a female masquerade and a water spirit\
  \ that comes to perform for mankind. \n\n\u201CShe is the beginning of all masquerades\
  \ and starts off the Water Spirit Season. The Water Spirit Season takes seventeen\
  \ years to complete. \n\n\u201CAlagba is the only water spirit who wears a leopard\
  \ skin cape: A symbol of power coveted by every Kalabari House...\u201D"
