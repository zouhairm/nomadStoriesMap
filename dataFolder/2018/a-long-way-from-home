Text: "An empty plastic bottle in each hand, I walked with long swinging strides,\
  \ raising dust with each step. The pavement was so damaged one could easily sprain\
  \ an ankle so I opted for the street instead, skipping left and right to avoid the\
  \ cracks in the asphalt.\n\nIt was just after 6 and the sun was hanging heavily\
  \ over the sleepy rooftops. It was to be another hot summer day \u2013 in July,\
  \ it can reach 40\xB0C in Bulgaria.\n\n\u201CGood morning!\u201D\n\nThe old woman,\
  \ sat on a crooked wooden bench, raised her gaze with a puzzled look. She squinted\
  \ and miniature wrinkles cut through her weary face. She was about 80.\n\n\u201C\
  I am looking for Magda, I was told she could sell me some fresh milk if I come early,\u201D\
  \ I waved the bottles, worried she might not hear well. \nMagda\u2019s shaky hand\
  \ reached for the wooden stick propped next to her and, with strenuous effort, she\
  \ got to her feet. In two leaps I found myself next to the old woman but her disapproving\
  \ look warned me she needed no help.\n\nYes, she can give me some milk; she was\
  \ just about to milk the cow. Yes, she is sure; who else would do it anyway. She\
  \ must give me some breakfast first though. So appallingly skinny I am, does no\
  \ one care to feed me! No, it\u2019s not too early for breakfast. No, coffee doesn\u2019\
  t count. \n\nWe chat over crispy banitsa \u2013 cheesy filo pastry (just like my\
  \ nana used to make it) that Magda had baked earlier \u201Cin case someone stopped\
  \ by\u201D. \n\nNo one stops by. Magda talked of how thriving the area once was.\
  \ Now it\u2019s one of over 550 villages in Bulgaria with less than 10 or no permanent\
  \ residents. \nAfter the socialist government resigned in 1989, agriculture lost\
  \ its significance for the country\u2019s economy. All land previously consolidated\
  \ into cooperative farms was returned to the rightful owners who often had little\
  \ incentive to manage it, leaving only a small share in large-scale production.\
  \ \n\nThe lack of work in the rural regions forced the younger population to the\
  \ cities, but, with one of the highest unemployment rates in Europe and salaries\
  \ five times less than those in Western countries, people fled abroad to seek better\
  \ opportunities. \n\nMagda's son lives in Milan. \n\n\u201CMy grandchildren are\
  \ foreigners,\u201D she stared out the unwashed window with a heavy heart.\n\nMagda\
  \ handed me the bottles. The milk felt warm through the plastic. She didn\u2019\
  t ask for money; I had paid her with my company. \n\n\u201CWill you be staying much\
  \ longer?\u201D\n\n\u201CAnother week and I must return home,\u201D I said, instantly\
  \ regretting it.\n \n\u201CWhere\u2019s home?\u201D Magda asked.\n\nReluctantly,\
  \ I answered: \u201CLondon.\u201D"
