Text: "It had been an idyllic holiday. In Manali for the last three days, my friends\
  \ and I had been spoiled by its offerings. We spent the days playing board games,\
  \ going on short hikes, and feasting, on food and panoramic views of the mountains.\
  \ At a caf\xE9, we struck up a conversation with the locals. They told us about\
  \ Jobra, a small village in the middle of a forest a mere four hours hike from Manali.\
  \ The village, in the middle of nowhere, beckoned with promises of glorious views\
  \ of the Milky Way. Something the four of us craved to experience firsthand.\n\n\
  The locals warned us that the route was treacherous and we should go there during\
  \ the day and camp for the night. However, their warnings fell on deaf ears. Restive,\
  \ we set off into the forest at 8 pm. \n\nThe forest was dark, and dense with foliage.\
  \ Sharing one torch, we cautiously made our way. Below us, we heard the river flowing.\
  \ Our spirits high, we joked about discovering new planets and constellations. Suddenly,\
  \ a jagged bolt lit up the night sky, illuminating the magnitude of our foolish\
  \ undertaking. We saw for the first time, the forbidding forest, the angry river\
  \ flowing far beneath on one side and the cruel ravine on the other. A misstep would\
  \ mean death. The frail beam of the torch was our only hope for salvation. \n\n\
  The lightening was a portent. The heavens opened. There was a downpour, sudden and\
  \ savage in its fury. The river, injected with life, roared louder, enraged at us\
  \ for attempting to escape its clutches. Hot flashes split apart the night sky,\
  \ haunting us long after they were gone. Thunder reverberated. The wind lashed our\
  \ bodies, pushing us closer to the abyss. \n\nDesolate, our will to continue shattered,\
  \ we huddled together. The four of us, alone for miles. Our minds wandered. We thought\
  \ of god, our families, of how insignificant we were compared to the might of nature.\
  \ \n\n\u2018Let\u2019s walk for ten minutes; I don\u2019t think the village is far.\u2019\
  \ I said, with a confidence I did not feel. In the next few hours, our only thought\
  \ was of the next step, everything else a luxury. We exhorted ourselves onward,\
  \ promising ourselves Jobra was only ten minutes away. Each of us slipped, would\
  \ have fallen into the abyss had we not been grabbed by the others. We found strength,\
  \ in ourselves and in each other, that we did not know existed.\n\nAs suddenly as\
  \ it had begun, the storm passed. Eventually, the narrow path widened into a clearing.\
  \ We had reached the village. For the first time in our lives, we smiled."
