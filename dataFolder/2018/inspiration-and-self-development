Text: "Our life is too short, that's why we ought to appreciate every action, word,\
  \ minute, person and experience. Life of every person consists of variety expectations.\
  \ While I was reading one of the well-known novel, I understood, that people live\
  \ all their life with expectation that someone will do all. Someone will help them\
  \ to find love, to build magnificent carrer or to get a well-paid job. But, I think\
  \ that all this points we shuold make by ourself. By the way, I do not expect to\
  \ get something from others. Maybe, it is very pesimistic thoughts, but they are\
  \ realistic. When I was 15 I have expected from life a lot. The las thing I expected\
  \ from the life it is happiness.  But how can I be happy, when our world is full\
  \ of awful things. For instance, war. My country is in war. And I can't even imagine\
  \ my happiness when thousands of people ae crying in the graveyards. According to\
  \ the satuation in the world I don't expect to reach happiness. \nMoreover, the\
  \ last thing I expected from friends it was help. The events which have happenned\
  \ to me for 2 months, showed, that I should look for help only from alien peolpe.\
  \ \nThe last thing I expected  from our goverment is that new reforms will destroy\
  \ the corruption at all. Unfortunately, no. They have only built new opportunities\
  \ for corruption.\nAnyway, every day prepares new expectations for us. Suppose,\
  \ they will be realistic and optimistic."
