Text: "I was on Orcas Island for two and a half months before I actually saw an orca,\
  \ and when I did see one, I was on an island nearby. Dreams of summer in the San\
  \ Juan Islands swam with images of whales breaching just outside my cabin, of constant,\
  \ billowy exhaust ascending from Massacre Bay. At the beginning of June, I learned\
  \ to my disappointment that orca sightings are rare from the campgrounds, so I spent\
  \ my days in acceptance that I likely wouldn\u2019t see any whales.\n\nBut my summer\
  \ was full. Nature exists there in a state of paradox and complacent mystery: it\u2019\
  s unfathomably large but small enough to hold in a single frame; it carries secrets\
  \ in the constant petrichor and morning mists. Boats glide across quiet waters into\
  \ Fauvistic horizons. I got used to and eventually revelled in the smell of bonfire\
  \ smoke in my hair when I woke up in the morning: it used to be a nuisance to be\
  \ washed out before the day started, but now it was a sweet reminder of rising sparks\
  \ and flickering shadows of the night before.\n\nIt was one of my last days of summer\
  \ in the islands. My friends and I decided to visit Lime Kiln State Park on San\
  \ Juan Island. The Strait of Juan de Fuca spread out before us, its sheer vastness\
  \ creating a whole world of rippling blue silk, stretching east to the landmass\
  \ of North America and west into the endless Pacific Ocean. The untouchable mountains\
  \ of the Olympic Peninsula lay south like a 100-mile-long dam. I stood there, an\
  \ evening breeze caressing my darkened shoulders and lightened hair, and let the\
  \ lingering breath of summer etch thick, permanent lines on every inch of my exposed\
  \ skin.\n\nWe spent a couple hours wandering along the cliffs, passing around beers\
  \ and watching the sun drop lower behind Victoria while the sky grew brilliant in\
  \ direct proportion. As we were about the leave to catch our ferry, five orcas surfaced\
  \ just fifty feet offshore from us. We ran along the rocks, breathless as their\
  \ metallic bodies reflected what light was left in the ephemeral evening sky. We\
  \ laughed and cheered in triumph and appreciation, and I knew that a barnacled piece\
  \ of me would always be here, watching and waiting for transient pods. \n\nAs we\
  \ took the ferry back to Orcas Island, our tired eyes and tanned limbs reflected\
  \ back at us in night-darkened windows and phosphorescent lighting. I pressed my\
  \ forehead against the glass to peer into the deep currents below, the boat gently\
  \ making slow miles between the whales and me."
