Text: "We were coming back to Jaisalmer from Tanot Ray temple, which was 200 km away\
  \ from the Jaisalmer city in Thar desert.\nThe Great Thar desert is located in the\
  \ western part of Rajasthan. Not much population density here\nThe hobby of my photography\
  \ stretched towards a large sand dune and we stopped the car. A Dokra(Old men) sitting\
  \ on a sand dune was feeding goats with his grandson. After seeing us, he called\
  \ his grandchildren near. He was still in a state of fear. I was trying to understand\
  \ the condition of the old man. Colorful dress, Flabby white turban and Holding\
  \ a clay jar. It was the traditional costume of the Dokra. His shining eyes were\
  \ expressing that he was afraid. He held her grandson's hand tightly. The grandson\
  \ was smiling.\nI don't know much local language. I instinctively asked \" How many\
  \ goats do you have?\". Even before the old man spoke, his grandson said \"8 goat\
  \ and 3 goat's child). Dokara smiled on the baby's answer. While my friends were\
  \ doing photography, the child's attention was on the camera. Now the line of anxiety\
  \ on the forehead of that old man was gone. I asked the child! What your name? He\
  \ say that \"Tiku\". Do you go to school. The child answered in \"Yes\" But he wanted\
  \ to say something else. Dokara told that my son is living in city for employment.\
  \ When the Tiku was in town then Tiku went to school. I and my wife is staying here\
  \ so Tiku has called back. We find urban lie bit him. The old man said that we live\
  \ across that dune. There is a group of 10-12 houses there.\nMy friend kept the\
  \ camera in my hands and proceeded to caress the goat's baby. \nTiku! You sit near\
  \ your grandfather and i take a pic. Tiku's desire was to keep the camera in hand.\n\
  I fulfilled his wish and gave some initial instructions. But Dokra said that my\
  \ grandson does not know anything! Do not give this machine to Tiku. I said \"no\
  \ worries! I will teach Tiku. As soon as Tiku took the camera; There was no limit\
  \ to his happiness. Tiku had learned the initial instructions. Tiku shot his grandfather's\
  \ photo and screamed! \" Grandpa look it\". The old man was happy but he feared\
  \ that the tire would not spoil the machine? Because the Dokra had never used electric\
  \ device. Then we shot the photo together. We gave chocolate to Tinku and advised\
  \ to go to school.\nWe sailed in the car. My friend was still looking at both and\
  \ told that old man chuckled the chocolate and threw it away.\nThen we discussed\
  \ the old man's fear of modernity."
