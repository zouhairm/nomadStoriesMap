Text: "I would call myself quite an experienced traveler based on my packing abilities\
  \ alone. Traveling since I was young, I learned the art of fitting the most important\
  \ items in the smallest luggage. \nOne of my warmest travel experiences took part\
  \ during high school where I traveled to France through an immersion program. Were\
  \ I spent five days with a host family in Evreux and went sightseeing for three\
  \ days in Paris.\nAt check in for this trip I looked around at many of my peers\
  \ carry-on luggage and laughed. I had checked in a small black suitcase that was\
  \ slightly bigger than most of their carry ons, while their bags were three times\
  \ the size of mine. This fact remained the discussion topic the entire journey across\
  \ the ocean. As my peers commented at my tiny suitcase coming around the bend of\
  \ the luggage pick up in Evreux I regretted nothing as I rolled my bag up to my\
  \ host family\u2019s car. \nGreeting me on my arrival was a single mother and her\
  \ daughter. I was surprised at how the program matched me with a host family. I\
  \ was placed in a family that mirrored my own and felt instantly comfortable as\
  \ they shared the same love between them as my Mom and I do. \nI was raised by a\
  \ strong single mother who worked hard to give me an amazing life and made up my\
  \ entire family, although I have eight half siblings on my father\u2019s side. My\
  \ host sister also had two sisters on her father\u2019s side but like me lived as\
  \ an only child raised by a strong mother.\nWithin a day I was told to consider\
  \ this sweet petite French lady as my mom and to ask her for whatever I desired\
  \ because \u201Cthat\u2019s what mothers do\u201D. I was touched by the sentiment\
  \ but couldn\u2019t help but laugh. This was more of a foreign concept to me than\
  \ speaking French at the dinner table, my mother who says no 99.9% of the time and\
  \ 0.01% being a maybe. \nTraveling thousands of miles I prepared myself for the\
  \ unexpected, but the most unexpected thing was to find myself so perfectly fit\
  \ with a family that had no clue who I was or where I came from. That from day one\
  \ opened their home and hearts to me, and made me feel like I belonged. Though their\
  \ family dynamics were so close to mine it was almost unnerving, there were times\
  \ were cultural differences shone bright. \nRolling my black carry-on sized suitcase\
  \ up to a English two door, dark green, smaller than a punch buggy sized car I knew\
  \ this was perfect. We snuggly set my bag in the back and fit ourselves like sardines\
  \ in the car and drove off as our adventure began."
