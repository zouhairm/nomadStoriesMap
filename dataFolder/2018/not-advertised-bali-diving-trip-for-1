Text: "A shimmer to my side and I turn my head to see a barracuda at eye level, slowly\
  \ following baitfish. The barracuda gazes fanatically at me before turning back\
  \ to its prey, disappearing in a haze of sunlight. The water is warm, and I look\
  \ downward.\nBelow me, as the bright tropical sea recedes into an ever deeper blue,\
  \ rests the wreck of the USAT Liberty. The gutted ship no longer has the sharp lines\
  \ and curves of a man-made vessel; instead, it has been given new life by asymmetrical,\
  \ organic growth. I can\u2019t quite make out the individual corals and fish, so\
  \ that their movements along the skeleton of the shipwreck animate it. The Liberty\
  \ pulses with the rhythm of the waves.\nMy breathe whooshes through the snorkel,\
  \ rattling slightly. I\u2019m going to freedive into this ship. No scuba tank, lungs\
  \ only. The extent of my freediving training is this: a drunken conversation with\
  \ an Australian at a beach bar last night.\nEyes scanning the body of the wreck,\
  \ I paddle over the open belly. This is where the most life is, waving and darting\
  \ around. I see a crossbeam within the ship\u2019s hold and determine to swim under\
  \ it.\nI take 3 full breathes, completely exhaling each. Sucking in as much air\
  \ as I can, I throw myself downwards, kicking my fins. I pop my ears. My nerves\
  \ are calmed now that I\u2019m actually diving. I continue to push deeper. To my\
  \ surprise, I find I have to pop my ears again, wiggling my jaw with a slight crackling\
  \ sound. \nI\u2019m swimming with purpose, realizing the crossbeam is further than\
  \ it seemed. I\u2019ve reached the edge of the ship and descend into the Liberty\u2019\
  s shadow where immediately the water is a touch cooler. Passing the walls of metal,\
  \ the ship\u2019s surface has clarified and I can see that the metal is splotched\
  \ with algae. I pop my ears for a third time. Now I\u2019m into the hold where corals\
  \ reveal their resolution. What looked like dull blurs from above showcase intricate\
  \ patterns and vibrancy, more than my eyes can take in as I continue to descend.\
  \ I must be 50 feet underwater. The crossbeam. As I loop under it, my lungs are\
  \ aching, and I\u2019m suddenly faced with a fish bigger than me. No time for pleasantries,\
  \ I kick, waving my arms upward.  The roof of air is far above as I struggle towards\
  \ it.  Kicking, grasping, racing the bubbles, squirming.\n*PSSSHEW!* I explode into\
  \ the air. Heaving, my chest is nearly spasming. I look towards the shore, where\
  \ the sun sits atop Mt. Agung. The volcano hasn\u2019t blocked out the light yet.\
  \ I think I can fit in a few more dives."
