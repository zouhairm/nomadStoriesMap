Text: "The chilling thought of seeing corpses lined up on a wall, staring at you while\
  \ you roam the endless hallways of Catacombe dei Cappuccini was something I never\
  \ thought I\u2019d experience. But on that fateful Saturday morning in Sicily, I\
  \ came face to face with death itself. \nIt was a hot day, probably one of the hottest\
  \ that August. I desperately needed to buy water so I enquired about the location\
  \ of the nearest shop to our tour guide, the most dapper 60 something \u201Csignore\u201D\
  \ I have ever met. In his lively Italian voice, he responded: \u201CCerto ragazza,\
  \ but you will have to wait as we are now heading to Catacombe dei Cappuccini!\u201D\
  \ I stared at him blankly since I fully understood that \u201Ccatacombe\u201D means\
  \ catacombs. I knew what I was about to see, so only one question stood firmly in\
  \ mind. Do I want to see that? I kept thinking this was something I\u2019d probably\
  \ never have the chance to see again, so I decided to hesitantly face my eternal\
  \ fear \u2013 death. After a short bus ride, one that felt like an eternity in my\
  \ head, we finally arrived.\nAs soon as we entered I saw the narrow, dark stairs\
  \ that led down to what felt and very vividly looked like the Underworld. I didn\u2019\
  t know what to expect as my heart was beating to the mixed rhythm of adrenaline\
  \ and anxiety. Once my feet touched the cold, stone ground, I was greeted by rows\
  \ upon rows of mummified corpses. I walked carefully, trying not to cause any disturbance\
  \ to our new not-so-lively hosts. All of them were wearing clothes, which made sense.\
  \ \u201CWe are not just skeletons, we are people. We were people, just you like\
  \ you. We wore clothing just like you. And one day, this will be your destiny too.\u201D\
  \ \u2013 I imagined them whispering to me. \nWhile still in the bus, the tour guide\
  \ told us about the catacombs\u2019 prized possession \u2013 two-year-old Rosalia\
  \ Lombardo, also known as \u201CThe Sleeping Beauty\u201D - a nickname given to\
  \ her because she, to this day, looks exactly like she did in 1920. Barely minutes\
  \ into this accessible Underworld, I was staring at the wooden coffin with a glass\
  \ top that had little Rosalia peacefully sleeping in it. But instead of the images\
  \ of terror that I had dreaded await me, I observed a normal, little girl in her\
  \ bed of eternal rest. At that moment I realized that nothing of this scared me.\
  \ Everything here is as normal as the outside world. As we stepped out of the catacombs,\
  \ I felt as if nothing I just saw was real. But my innermost self was at ease -\
  \ I faced my fears and came out triumphant."
