Text: "I have always identified as a hard-worker, never growing tired, sacrificing\
  \ whatever's needed to get the job done. I served tirelessly as an urban teacher,\
  \ Dean of Students and teacher coach for ten years in Milwaukee. My identity and\
  \ self-worth has always surrounded my work. That was until it didn't. I lost my\
  \ job on December 19th of 2016. That date will be permanently ingrained in me. Me,\
  \ the perfect, diligent, self-denying, burn myself out employee. I'll never forget\
  \ how it happened either. The principal called me into her office, she looked at\
  \ me and said, \"This isn't working!\" Now don't get me wrong, I hated my job. To\
  \ be clear, I wasn't bad at my job and I didn't hate the school or the students,\
  \ in fact, I loved teaching. I was good at it too. I can manage a classroom, and\
  \ teach content in a rigorous way, and I have a knack for training others to do\
  \ the same. My job was fulfilling, but I was unhappy. Somewhere along the way, I\
  \ lost myself. I lost my fire. I lost my joy. I lost what made me, me. But teaching\
  \ was all I knew. Without it I had lost my identity and self-worth, along with my\
  \ job. \n \nI was living to work rather than working to live. I was burning myself\
  \ out to serve others. There's nothing wrong with serving others, but ignoring self-care\
  \ is the first and biggest step toward implosion. And giving up the things you love\
  \ and that makes you, you for a job leads to resentment. After sitting on my couch\
  \ for two months, wallowing in self-pity, I decided to get up and make a change.\
  \ I took three days to go through every room in my house, and I purged over seventy-five\
  \ bags of things. I sold some things and donated the rest. I then packed up what\
  \ was left and put it in storage. I bought a ticket to Spain and I moved abroad.\
  \ And so, the adventure began. \n\nI've spent the last six months living in Spain.\
  \ Moving to Spain certainly has not been an easy journey. Struggles, regardless\
  \ of where you live, have a way of following you. Living in Spain has opened my\
  \ eyes. I know my journey has only just begun. I am still a teacher, but I am also\
  \ a learner, a writer, a traveler, a lover of quality time, a beach goer, a hiker,\
  \ a puppy mom, a friend, a daughter, a yogi and a reader. I can be a teacher without\
  \ sacrificing the rest of me. I can enjoy everyday life and be grateful for its\
  \ many blessings each day. Life is an adventure. I am living it boldly. I am living\
  \ it on purpose."
