Text: "Hangzhou is a Chinese sub-provincial city where modernity meets tradition.\
  \ Is also the hometown of Jack Ma, the founder of the e-commerce giant Alibaba,\
  \ so don\u2019t be surprised if everything can be bought just with one click from\
  \ your smartphone.\n\nI caught the fast train from Shanghai to meet Lee, my couchsurfing\
  \ host. The fare itself was around one hour, but unfortunately, till I met my host\
  \ I spent 2 hours changing several metro lines. No worries,  just ordinary life\
  \ in a Chinese middle city. \n\nOnce arrived to the neighborhood, a long row of\
  \ same looking buildings welcomed me. This area didn't sound cozy for me. Fortunately,\
  \ the flat of my Chinese host was warm  like the owner, which welcomed me with a\
  \ cup of milk tea and explained how to use the air conditioning in my small room.\
  \ If you are planning a trip to Asia please forget the radiators, they don\u2019\
  t know what it is! The following day we decided to visit the West Lake, of course\
  \ spending again 2 hours on the bus, but later my eyes just couldn\u2019t stop watching\
  \ the amazing atmosphere around the Lake. It was like to be in the movies of old\
  \ China. The lake was quiet, with several boats built according to old Chinese cut\
  \ through the waters. Even when everybody takes pictures because you are foreign,\
  \ you can still slowly walk and feel the Chinese spirit. After the walk, we decided\
  \ to fulfill our stomachs, so Lee brought me to try some street food in the center\
  \ of the city, built in colonial style. Hangzhou\u2019s street food offers you many\
  \ kind of delights, starting with scorpions and larva and finishing with a Chinese\
  \ pizza, similars to a salty French pasta.\n\nAfter the culinary meeting, we decided\
  \ to come back home. First we had to get out from pedestrian area to find our Dudu\
  \ \u2013 cheap taxi ordered through application. Unfortunately, to call Dudu you\
  \ must know Chinese because Dudu\u2019s driver call you before he arrives. We walked\
  \ with Lee in the narrow streets, together with  bikes and motorbikes, and pedestrians\
  \ can\u2019t cross the street before the cars even when they have green light. Hangzhou\
  \ is very loudly, crowdie and it doesn\u2019t  seem the same city of West Lake.\
  \ We were missing rabbit which ate cooked rice and we caught our taxi.\n \nThe last\
  \ day Lee took me to the city market. The meat was just put it on butcher\u2019\
  s desk without freezer so I decided that \u2018tofu and vegetables is perfect for\
  \ me\u2019.  After our dinner I said \u2018Goodbye Hangzhou!\u2019. I will never\
  \ forgot Hangzhou, city which Chinese are especially proud of."
