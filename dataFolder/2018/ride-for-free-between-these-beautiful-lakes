Text: "I'm sitting there. On a chair in Mc Donald's in Tauranga searching for a new\
  \ Job. And there it is. A man speaks to me. He said he would have a job for me and\
  \ he likes German guys so much. Outside at the Parkside is his big car. A Ford Ranger.\
  \ He asks me if I have my driving licences and if I could take the car to the service\
  \ station and take it for the weekend. I couldn't believe that what he was saying\
  \ at these moment. Now it was my first lefthand ride in Newzealand and it was unforgettable.\
  \ To the famous Mount Manganui. I turned the music as loud as I can and were driving\
  \ along the beach side with my look at perfect waves and surfers who catching them.\
  \ The next day I drove back to my hostel and showed my friends my new big car! They\
  \ couldn't believe it too. This night I decided to call my best girlfriend from\
  \ Germany in Skype. As she saw this car outside at the parkside, where I was showing\
  \ it to her, she began to laugh!\nOn Monday morning I get a call from these nice\
  \ guy (his name was Paul) and drove to his big house with this wonderful view to\
  \ the beach two hours from Tauranga. I had so nice sunny weather this morning and\
  \ I had now a very good feeling to drive lefthandside. Especially whit this view\
  \ to the mountains and so much green around me and sheeps, cows and birds. I met\
  \ there at Paul's place an another traveler - a French men which name I can't spell..\
  \ Paul gave us the chance to staying a little bit longer in his incredible house.\
  \ He showed us another car. A red small race car. He troped us to a famous mountain\
  \ and we had the greatest experience ever. I feeled like I'm in \"Need for Speed\"\
  \ while I was driving around these big hill on this big roads where trucks from\
  \ 'Timber' came trew our way. We had beautiful weather and in front of us 15 meters\
  \ was a little wallaby which jumped across the road back in these 'Timber-Forest'!\n\
  We also climbed on top of the Tarawera hill and had a perfect view over the whole\
  \ north island from New Zealand! \nI had a sleep in a wonderful double bed in a\
  \ big room with a big window for me for free! I still couldn't believe that.. The\
  \ next days the French guy and me decided to travel the whole coast until Gisborne.\
  \ What took us the whole day. But it was such a perfect day. With so many perfect\
  \ quiet lakes in these pure nature. It feels like a dream. At least I'm so grateful\
  \ for Paul. To have now this memories I will never forget in my whole life! Thank\
  \ you so much\U0001F64F\U0001F3FB\U0001F30F"
