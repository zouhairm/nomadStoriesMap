Text: "There is something about Friday night as well that insinuates debauchery and\
  \ revelry. On blotto, isn\u2019t Nigeria noted to be the highest consumer of Champagne,\
  \ just after France where it is traditionally produced? On debauchery, I can remember\
  \ my time in Ibadan when I was working in a law firm. We usually closed office on\
  \ Friday very late just to sit back for rush hour to ease off. This always afforded\
  \ me the occasion of mesmerisation whenever I was returning home and a taxi was\
  \ taking me through the districts of Dugbe, Iyaganku, Ring Road. These routes were\
  \ dominated by discoth\xE8ques and night workers, but you will never suspect anything\
  \ sinister during the daytime.\n\nBut I want to believe Benin City on Friday night\
  \ is among the most sinister of African metropolises. It is a surest passage to\
  \ discover the paean to the city\u2019s beauty and affluent secrets \u2013 everybody\
  \ knows about the secrets, even as far as continents away. Bodies of women from\
  \ this city tell it on the bed of prostitution in Europe and America. On this Friday\
  \ night, the beauty and true character of Benin City yielded to me at once.\n\n\
  I was on my way to meet with friends at GRA who were on a travel project, Borders\
  \ Within: The Trans-Nigerian Road Trip. They were merely having a stopover in the\
  \ city for few days. We had met the previous day on the Ugbowo Campus of University\
  \ of Benin, Benin City. I wound my way to Ring Road on a campus shuttle. I walked\
  \ along the Oba market to a taxi park going to GRA. The circular road that enclosed\
  \ the museum at Ring Road has always fascinated me. A museum at the heart of a city\
  \ and a busy road encircling it. This was also a fascination and hazard for another\
  \ traveller, Noo Saro-Wiwa in her book, Looking for Transwonderland: \u2018Benin\u2019\
  s former glories had now retreated behind the four walls of its museum. Reaching\
  \ the place felt like a life-threatening challenge, seemingly designed to test one\u2019\
  s commitment to its antiquities. The museum was sequestered within the confines\
  \ of a busy roundabout that forced visitors to sprint across four lanes of ruthless\
  \ traffic to reach it.\u2019\n\nIt was a rutted ride; it took probably about forty\
  \ minutes. \n\nOn my return trip, I discovered a den of prostitutes I had never\
  \ seen in the city."
