Text: "I was on Erasmus. I fetl tge queen of the world.\nOne morning, I woke up on\
  \ Bucharest thinking that I needed to left my comfort zone for a while, so I started\
  \ planning the best trip od our lives.\n2moths later, we were leaving Romania. We\
  \ arrived at Bulgary at 9 pm, with no hostel, couchsurfing... So we made our own\
  \ free tour looking for acommodation for 14 friends. The next morning we saw all\
  \ the capital and we met 2 spanish guys that told us where to have some beers, and\
  \ we finished our trip with new Erasmus friends in other country. \nThen, we arrived\
  \ at Albania at 4am, with no idea of where we was. Fortunatly, we asked to a local\
  \ man about our hostel and he guided us 4km walking, so, the less thing we could\
  \ do was invited him to a beer in the street. The first night, we slept in the hall\
  \ of our comunist hostel, so we woke up early this morning to see Tirana, the capital.\
  \ The tour was amazing, and for only 4\u20AC, we ate and drunk like in a wedding\
  \ (spanish joke).\nOur next stop was Macedonia, where we asked to our guide why\
  \ the country has the same name as a spanish desert (spanish joke, again). But,\
  \ before left Albania, I saw the european map to check where we were, and I saw\
  \ a little \"country\" called Kosovo and... There we went! Everything in Kosovo\
  \ was growing, was the uglest city I saw, but, again, the food was amazing, so I\
  \ give a 10. The main thing I liked was that the main boulevard name was \"Bill\
  \ Clinton\"... Good job, Kosovo! When we finally arrived in Skopje,  I saw the most\
  \ beatifull landscapes in the world in the Matka lake, where we did kayak with 1\xB0\
  C... So cold!\nIn my plans, Macedonia was the last country and we have to return\
  \ to Bulgary, but.. What's that? Montenegro? It sounds interesting... Ey guys, why\
  \ don't we...? And in the next morning we woke up in Podgorica, the capital, where\
  \ we felt more a family than never... We saw the main monuments in 2 hours and spent\
  \ the rest of the day having a sun bath and playing in a river. \nThen.. What? Serbia\
  \ may be? Yes, come on! We came to Belgrade to take a train to Timisoara, in the\
  \ north of Romania and then to Bucharest (14hours in train). We spent the day in\
  \ a bar were two months ago I celebrated my birthday... \nEverything ends where\
  \ it starts...\nAfter this trip, I can't have stereotypes, or prejuices... When\
  \ I slept in my bed after 9 days, in this moment I tought that that is what makes\
  \ me happy and what I want to do in my life. Discover, learn, share... Everything\
  \ that travel can give you"
