Text: "The night in Durban started slowly - just meeting people and chilling in the\
  \ hostel. Heading alone to a local bar around the corner was perhaps the best decision\
  \ of my life.\nAs is my habit, I love connecting with the locals and apparently\
  \ they with me.Out of nowhere, two local guys invited me for a drink and called\
  \ me \u2018Jumanji\u2019, as I looked like Alan Parris: long hair, strong beard.\
  \ The night together with my new local friends, Justin and Prince, progressed to\
  \ a club on the outskirts--positive vibes around us and no sign of any desire to\
  \ go home at 6 o\u2019clock in the morning.\nThe boys realized my interest in their\
  \ culture, so they showed me around the local Victoria Market.They introduced me\
  \ to the local life while I was talking and interacting with different locals, such\
  \ as a bus driver and a money collector.I saw little kids selling at the street\
  \ vendors\u2019 booths and came to understand that 90% of these vendors come from\
  \ abroad, \u201Cwhich creates a different environment in Durban\u201D. It was an\
  \ experience of pure culture. Suddenly, Justin invited me to a family wedding. What\
  \ a unique offer!\nA guy suddenly walked past Justin, bumping into him as he passed.\
  \ Justin turned around and simply asked why? But the guy kept on going.Justin raised\
  \ his voice a second time with no response.Turning to me, he explained, \u201CThe\
  \ caste system still haunts Africa, where people are judged by their race\u201D\
  .The experience gave me goose bumps; it was a very emotional moment.\n \u201CDo\
  \ you want to see more? Ok, I\u2019ll show you all the drug dealers around the place!\u201D\
  \ While we walked around, Justin pointed them out, greeting them by name.They were\
  \ standing everywhere: near small shops run by families, next to vendor booths.\
  \ I couldn\u2019t believe my eyes.\n\u201CTobi, you have to pay attention to the\
  \ little things.When I was younger, I was involved in some not-so-desirable situations!\u201D\
  \ He got very emotional, and with tears running down his face, he told me that \u201C\
  people from abroad just come here and try to avoid what\u2019s behind the real Africa\u201D\
  , and his wish was to share this with family and friends.\nAs they dropped me off\
  \ at the hostel at 11:30am, Prince gave me his phone number. I left Durban and South\
  \ Africa without going to the wedding, seeing anyone or saying thanks. My only hope\
  \ was that our paths would cross again!\nAnd they did! Three years later, I installed\
  \ WhatsApp, and scrolling down my contact list, Prince randomly appeared. I messaged\
  \ him, \u201CHey, it\u2019s Tobi.\u201D He remembered me right away as \u2018Jumanji\u2019\
