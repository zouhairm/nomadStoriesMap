Text: "I grew up like any Moroccan kid; travel for me meant a 2-week trip with my\
  \ family during summer holidays.Then I moved to Lille, France to study. Fast forward\
  \ to summer 2015, I was stuck in a 4-month internship which meant no summer holidays\
  \ for me. And that was the moment I knew the 9 to 5 lifestyle was not meant for\
  \ me. A colleague at work invited me to visit Macedonia. As I was drowning at work,\
  \ I didn\u2019t think twice and booked a flight to Macedonia. Then the big day came!\n\
  Once at the airport, the clerk informed me that I needed a permanent residence permit\
  \ to get to Macedonia. I only had a temporary one.\nI felt like the world crumbled\
  \ underneath my feet; My friend told me that he could drive to Greece and meet me\
  \ there. So I started looking for a plane ticket to Greece. I couldn\u2019t believe\
  \ it when I found a one way ticket to Chania, Creta for 50 euros. It was in Greece,\
  \ so there is no need to check where it was right ? WRONG. The island was almost\
  \ closer to Libya than Athens. But it was too late; After the flight, I was in Greece!\
  \ It felt oddly great to see all the signs in a foreign alphabet. I looked at the\
  \ taxi fares table, Chania 20 euros. I used Google maps. The distance to get there:\
  \ 14km, a 3-hour walk. 20 euros or walk, the choice was easy for me: I chose to\
  \ walk! \nAfter minutes of walking, the streets got empty, everything was dark,\
  \ and there were no lights on the streets. All I was left with were dark fields\
  \ of bushes on both sides of the road.\nI got scared hearing the noises made by\
  \ the wind, and considered going back to pay the 20 bucks, but I decided to continue.\
  \ Then it started raining. My night was going from bad to worse. I decided to take\
  \ refuge under the patio of the nearest house. An old lady came out of the house,\
  \ She started talking to me in Greek, and I tried to tell her that I didn\u2019\
  t speak it. She then called her husband, and we had the same unintelligible conversation.\
  \ To my surprise, he invited me in!\nThat moment will stick with me for life! How\
  \ can a stranger invite me to his home? Wasn\u2019t the world supposed to be dangerous?\
  \ Wasn\u2019t I supposed to be a terrorist? The old couple\u2019s son then drove\
  \ me to a hostel. And then I was struck by another act of kindness: when asking\
  \ for the price, I heard 30 instead of 13, and since I was extremely tired, I didn\u2019\
  t think twice and gave away a 10 and 20 bills. To my surprise, the receptionist\
  \ took the 20 bill and said that it was just 13.. little by little I started regaining\
  \ trust in humanity."
