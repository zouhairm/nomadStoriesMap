Text: "With my sunglasses perched upon my face, I slid open the patio door.  Breathe\
  \ deep.  My eyes closed as the flowers filled my heart and lungs with gratitude.\
  \  It had been awhile, but today I felt well enough to run.  I turned toward the\
  \ ocean and watched it sparkle in the sunlight.  True bliss.  Over to the right\
  \ of me was yet another heron.  A touch of Heaven.\n  As I ran, my mind went back.\
  \  I had been diagnosed with a life changing disease a few years ago and my heart\
  \ was broken.  I was on a mission of self discovery to help me heal.  I had spent\
  \ time detoxing, eating clean, journaling, doing yoga, and riding a bike down the\
  \ California coast.  I was beaming.  But I needed more.\n  Oceanside Pier stretched\
  \ out into the water in front of me.  The crisp cool air now smelled of old wood,\
  \ seaweed, moss and tar.  I would stop directly under the pier and look out into\
  \ the ocean.  Where the posts ended, a small door like image appeared.  A gateway.\
  \  I continued on.  A man stepped out from the water.  A ball cap covered most of\
  \ his curly grey hair.  With alcohol on his breath and a cigarette in hand, he told\
  \ me stories about his life and how the ocean relates to our life here on land.\
  \  We walked together down the beach until I saw the tower of rocks.  Someone stood\
  \ guard.\n  His name is Cary, he too is a street person.  He appears shy, quiet\
  \ and reserved as I asked to take his photo with the rocks.  I ask him what it takes\
  \ to build such an art form.  His face softens as he speaks.  His hands clasp behind\
  \ his back and he smiles as he talks about all the distractions he faces.  His bare\
  \ foot brushes over the sand.  As I listen to his words, I realize the rock tower\
  \ represents our lives.  I learn sometimes the towers need to fall down so we can\
  \ rebuild.  Sometimes new pieces are added and some of the old rocks get placed\
  \ back into this balancing act we call life.  As he pours ocean water over the top\
  \ of the structure, more beauty emerges.  The largest rock would sparkle and shine\
  \ the most beautiful shade of green.  My heart swells as I watch the water trickle\
  \ down.  With natures tears, the rocks wept.  This was our lives.  Something shifts\
  \ as we sit down to talk with each other.  He would tell me part of his story and\
  \ I would share some of mine.  I would take my sunglasses off to look him in the\
  \ eye as I thanked him.  I felt a sense of freedom and a heart full of joy as we\
  \ healed another part of our souls that day on the beach. Out there, amongst the\
  \ rocks of life."
