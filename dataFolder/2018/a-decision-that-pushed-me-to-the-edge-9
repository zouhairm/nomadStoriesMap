Text: "A decision that pushed me to the edge\n\nLost. I Raquel Lewis was completely\
  \ and utterly lost, and not just in the quaint vibrant streets of Havana but in\
  \ life as well.\nI have always had my life planned, planned out 5 years in advance\
  \ to be specific. I would finish my degree in three years, all while dating my boyfriend\
  \ Kyle, we would graduate together, then we would get perfect jobs, become engaged\
  \ and wait another year and have the most magical wedding and honeymoon in Havana,\
  \ Cuba and then live happily ever after.  I had it all planned out, but you know\
  \ what they say, when you make plans God laughs. In the span of two weeks my boyfriend\
  \ had dumped me, the only job I wanted (and applied for) hired someone else and\
  \ my plan had successfully failed. I did not know what to do to get this plan I\
  \ had for my life back on track so whilst crying in my car about my broken plans\
  \ I asked the universe for a sign, a sign to tell me what I should do and then Havana\
  \ Moon by Carlos Santana played and in that moment of complete emotional turmoil\
  \ I made a decision that pushed me to the edge.\nSix months ago I never would have\
  \ imagined that I would be alone in a new city, on another continent no less, without\
  \ a boyfriend or job, yet here I am sipping a cocktail that resembles a sunset in\
  \ a small restaurant in Malec\u1F40n overlooking the northern shore of Havana. The\
  \ picturesque Almendares River glistening with possibilities. It has been two weeks\
  \ of pure bliss and I can honestly say I have never been happier.  I spend my days\
  \ exploring majestic fortresses such as the Castillo Del Morro, the La Cabana and\
  \ the San Salvador de la Punta Fortress, soaking up every drop of culture and history\
  \ I can. Whilst my nights are filled with cocktails, Cuban music and cigars. Eating\
  \ food that has aromas so strong they drag you in from afar. Surrounded by rich\
  \ accents from all parts of the globe, people from different backgrounds and cultures.\n\
  Boarding a plane to a foreign country may dwell on the extreme side of options to\
  \ change my life but I was so stuck in what I had planned out for myself that I\
  \ neglected to be spontaneous and just be and ultimately just allowing myself to\
  \ take a chance and follow my wildest dreams. I made a decision that pushed me to\
  \ the edge of who I thought I was and who I could be and taking a step off that\
  \ ledge was one of the greatest decisions of my life. \n\nYes, I Raquel Lewis, was\
  \ most definitely lost. But I am starting to think that maybe it\u2019s not such\
  \ a bad thing."
