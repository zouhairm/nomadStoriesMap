Text: "I don\u2019t remember if it was Monday or Thursday or June or March. I could\
  \ find out the exact day looking back into my memories and into some receipts I\
  \ always keep after my travels. But it\u2019s not important for our story, so never\
  \ mind. \nIt was a sunny and chilly morning in San Antonio de los Cobres, Salta\
  \ Province, Argentina. Most of them are in that part of the Andes mountains. It\u2019\
  s the commercial center of that remote and sparsely populated part of the province:\
  \ a dry, cold, windy and very elevated area that relies on mining and llama farming\
  \ to live. \nIt hadn\u2019t been easy to get there cycling, all roads that lead\
  \ to the town are not paved and in very bad shape. But I don\u2019t regret the suffering,\
  \ I could see the most beautiful landscapes I had ever seen. The dirt road full\
  \ of potholes that took me there (Ruta 40) passed through the middle of some deep\
  \ canyons with every possible tone of red, orange and yellow in its rocks. \nI was\
  \ about to face one of the toughest challenge of my year-long mountain bike trip.\
  \ Abra del Acay is the highest road pass in the world. I don\u2019t know if it was\
  \ the craving for challenges, the vanity of being one of the few people that cycled\
  \ so high or just to see how things are so close to the sky. \nMy bike and I woke\
  \ up early that day. I had breakfast in the hotel and said goodbye to the receptionist.\
  \ \u201CWish me luck\u201D. \n\nI took the dirt road that lead to the city of Salta.\
  \ Parallel to it, they were building a new one, paved and wide. I didn\u2019t like\
  \ it. I wanted that beautiful area to remain a treasure for the most audacious.\
  \ How selfish.\n\nI took a smaller side road that lead to the pass. This road was\
  \ even worse. In most places, the road was pure sand. Like cycling upwards in a\
  \ beach.\n\nI was cycling with the determination of who has no other choice. If\
  \ I turned back I would consider myself a loser for the rest of my life. I only\
  \ came across two cars, both in my direction, and both offered me a lift to the\
  \ summit. I thanked them and refused. It would have been cheating.\nThe night arrived\
  \ and I wasn\u2019t already at the top. I was exhausted, no oxygen in the air. I\
  \ was breathing fast and shallow. I went down of the bike. I pushed it. It was freezing\
  \ at 4800mof height, but there was no other choice than pushing. My heart was bumping\
  \ as I climbed following the light of my lantern. \n\nDon\u2019t ask me anything\
  \ about the last half an hour. I was not there. I got to the top around midnight\
  \ and I set my tent and slept in the warmest of the lonelinesses."
