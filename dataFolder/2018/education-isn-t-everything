Text: "'Why don't you continue your studies?' \u2014 I always preferred influencing\
  \ those who discontinued their education. But not this girl !! Not at all !!\n\n\
  It was an evening in Kuta beach, when the Sun was pampering the shore. Breezy evening.\
  \ I was walking around the beach, as usual with my camera - Eagerly hunting for\
  \ portraits (of strangers) and scenery !!\n\nI bumped into her, accidentally! As\
  \ I was strolling around by viewing through the lens, I missed to notice a teenager\
  \ sitting on the coast.\n\nI apologized again and again. She didn't speak or didn't\
  \ want to speak to me. She hardly nodded, acknowledging my apology. It drove me\
  \ curious !!\n\nI sought \"Can I please sit here?\". She didn't get me at first.\
  \ When I coupled with signs, she graciously nodded 'okay'.\n\nI sat about a feet\
  \ from her and started to crack her silence. She was not turning to me but gradually\
  \ started to respond, first in sign language, then in her native language and finally\
  \ in ENGLISH !!!\n\nHer accent and vocabulary were stunning. I asked surprisingly\
  \ \"Your communication skills are awesome, where are you studying?\"\n\nShe thanked\
  \ me and said that she studied up to 6th grade and discontinued. She paused for\
  \ a moment and I deliberately stayed silent to let her continue. Then she went on\
  \ and on. Her parents were killed in an accident when she was just a year old. Her\
  \ sister grew up her. When she was 12 years, she realized her sister wasn't doing\
  \ a \"decent job\" and her sister pressed her move out of their place and find a\
  \ decent job. At least she could lead a quality and peaceful life, if not her sister.\n\
  \nSince then she has been serving as a babysitter for a rich family in this city.\
  \ She isn't happy about leaving her only sister there but is happy of being in a\
  \ decent job as her sister wished.\n\nI bid adieu. Only thing she told me was this\
  \ - \"If you've excess money, educate a poor girl !!\"\n\nI replied, \"I'll do it,\
  \ sister !! I will, for sure\"."
