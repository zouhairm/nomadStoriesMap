Text: "Standing on the side of the main road out of Reykjavik with my thumb out, I\
  \ had a mixture of trepidation, fear, and excitement buzzing in my head. Even at\
  \ nearly 25, there is still something mildly captivating about going against your\
  \ parent\u2019s best wishes. There are really only two things I can remember my\
  \ parents being adamant about growing up, tattoos and hitchhiking.\n\nBefore you\
  \ also jump on their bandwagon and call me irresponsible. Let's do some critical\
  \ thinking. The population of Iceland is around 300000. The violent crime rate is\
  \ practically non-existent. In 2013 they only had 1 homicide. He wasn't one of the\
  \ 1 million tourist that visit every year either.\n\nIt was less than 10 minutes\
  \ of watching traffic flow feeling my faith in humanity sink, until it exponentially\
  \ rose when a silver panel van pulled over. I assumed it was a tourist van, not\
  \ expecting any locals to pick me up. However, the driver was a middle-aged old\
  \ local, with good but not great English. Struggling to make broken conversation\
  \ I mentioned the 50km race I was doing on the weekend. Once we had got around the\
  \ pronunciation issues, he was surprised but happy to point out the active volcano\
  \ in the distance where I would be running, Mt. Hengill.\n\nHe was a keen hiker\
  \ himself and offered to show me the track. I assumed we would just go to the trailhead,\
  \ have a look and turn around. Instead he stopped the car, we got out, and started\
  \ wandering up the track together. An hour or so of walking later and I was starting\
  \ to wonder what I had got myself into.\n\nLuckily, there were plenty of tourists\
  \ about for the \"hot river\" and geothermal activity so the little nagging doubts\
  \ of, \"crazy Icelandic man with panel van murders tourist\", had little credibility.\
  \ Plus, he just seemed like a genuinely kind, mountain person, proudly showing me\
  \ his country. He took care to point out things like the wild blueberries and little\
  \ round black berries that would soon be ripe for picking. He told me of hiking\
  \ trips he had made with his son. \n\nDays later I stood awestruck a top Mt Hengill,\
  \ 25km into a 50km ordeal. From a high, you could see out across green grassy plains,\
  \ meandering creeks, red rocky pillars to the expansive shoreline beyond. I couldn\u2019\
  t help but think of the panel van man. There was something magical about this country.\
  \ Iceland feels like it comes straight of a fairy tale, wild berries, waterfalls,\
  \ bubbling mud pools and all. Perhaps, I even found my fairy godfather along the\
  \ way."
