Text: "Last year, while figuring out the place to travel, we decide upon Nepal-the\
  \ country of scenic extremes.Traveling does make you a storyteller.\nHowever, after\
  \ struggling for air tickets, my co-travelers and I decided to go make it a road\
  \ trip. I am a mountain girl, hailing from Himachal and so the journey seemed quite\
  \ familiar. On my road trip to Nepal, after all devastating thing Nepal has gone\
  \ through, the last thing I expected was the pristine roads. Those unending meandering\
  \ roads touching the azure horizon was simply a stunner. And the fact that we didn\u2019\
  t feel even a single bump was even more amazing. \nIn the west, a smooth road might\
  \ not be a luxury. But in developing nations like India and Nepal, the appalling\
  \ road conditions are a major issue of debate. Besides, Nepal was hit by a massive\
  \ earthquake recently and roads like these were something I least expected. However\
  \ it\u2019s not just roads, Nepal has a lot to be inspired about. \nBefore we reached\
  \ Kathmandu, via Tanakpur border, we still had some 500 km to cover. And so we decided\
  \ to halt at a roadside dhaba (a local eating joint) which had only meat to offer.\
  \ I being a vegetarian searched the market around and found wai-wai (instant noodles)\
  \ to eat.\nWhile I was satiating my hunger, an old man rushed out from the Dhaba,\
  \ blabbering something gibberish. After seeing his furrowed brows evoking only fury,\
  \ I gathered courage and tried talking to him in Hindi and asked:\u201CWhat language\
  \ is it?\" Furious as he was, he yelled at me saying, \u201CGerman.\u201D I quickly\
  \ Googled the phrase \u201CHau ab\u201D for its meaning. He was actually asking\
  \ his daughter-in-law to \"get lost\" in German who was nothing but trying to feed\
  \ him. As curios as I am, I tried to inquire from the lady and came to know that\
  \ the old man was deputed in Germany in 1998 for special training as he was a part\
  \ of Nepali regiment of the Indian Army. She said, Baba had gone to \"bahar desh\"\
  \ (Foreign Country), and has learned to speak this language. Giving a smirk, she\
  \ said, \u201CWhile he can\u2019t even do his daily jobs on his own, he doesn\u2019\
  t forget to flaunt his knowledge of German.\u201D\nIn a border village, in a country\
  \ like Nepal, finding an ex Nepalese soldier of Indian Army was the last thing I\
  \ expected. The woman also told me that even being a soldier of Indian Army, his\
  \ father-in-law didn\u2019t cherish life much. He always complain about the futile\
  \ wars that took place between India and other countries. He thus shows his belief\
  \ by expressing anger every single day."
