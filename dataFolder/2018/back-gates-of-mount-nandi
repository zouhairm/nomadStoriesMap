Text: "\u201CThe Back Gates for Mount Nandi\u201D\n\nWhat\u2019s so special about\
  \ this place Nandi eh?! I have driven, ridden and cycled all the way to the top\
  \ you say eiyh??? What if I say\u2026 I climbed this mountain all the way to the\
  \ peak through stone laid steps with sheer greenery embellished all around it, leafy\
  \ branches slapping and scratching me every time I start thinking twice about reaching\
  \ the peak. Here\u2019s how my Saturday sprouted\u2026\n\nI wake up at around 3:43AM\
  \ (sleep deprivation stirred with adventure rush) trot trim and track up for this\
  \ very trek! 4:14AM all set with my backpack whir up my engine and vroom!!! Everything\
  \ about this journey sounded mediocre till I took a right turn to Nandi graama (a\
  \ village truly pruned with a roaring rocky view). I was told to locate a historic\
  \ temple \u201CBhoganandishwara\u201D of 15th century 815A.D to be explicit and\
  \ POW! There it was\u2026 This very temple with a solid stone compound stood beside\
  \ me after travelling 4-5km inwards nandi graama. With very few people around I\
  \ happened to reiterate this statement \u201CGod surely knows where to relax\u201D\
  \n\nWith so less constructive materials to build such artistic sculptures, towers\
  \ and more sculptures you can feel thy old school builders come to life and say\
  \ \u201CYeah keep thinking Kid\u201D. Kalyani sleeps serene. Absolute beauty guys\
  \ I merely am nearing to your best imagination but this very view just upgrade your\
  \ imagination without Wi-Fi I tell you\u2026\n\nThen yeah well back to my adventure\
  \ rush I chuff up my engine and dawdle around finding my trekking destination which\
  \ happened to be in \u201CSulthan pete\u201D inside nandi grama. You do get to feast\
  \ your bike or car with yummy fuel just in case you thought the fuel would sum up\
  \ and later repented how dumb you were to ASSume stuff cuz that happened with me\n\
  \nThe road starts to shrink width wise and my eyes starts to widen breadth wise,\
  \ I had entered a mystical place with an added \u201Ca\u201D it seemed like a Palace!\
  \ It\u2019s how once harry potter discovered Hogwarts express in 3\xBC platform!!!\
  \ I was so overwhelmed I started thinking as to why I was driving on a footpath\
  \ seeing all the flattened stones seated in such discipline. The driver inside me\
  \ unlocked his seat belt while my explorer started stretching and squatting to take\
  \ off to the peak. I start off after parking my car on the toepath which was beside\
  \ footpath:D. Every step I laid to reach the top made me look like a hermit who\
  \ levitate for peace"
