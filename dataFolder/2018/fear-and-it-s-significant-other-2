Text: "On a mid January californian winter day in 2014, I packed the motorcycle I\
  \ got from Will, a guy I befriended just a few months before in burning man. The\
  \ moment has came. I have been day dreaming about what's about to happen for a very\
  \ long time. I made sure all the equipment is tight and started the ride. I took\
  \ the notorious 405 highway heading south to the Mexican border in tijuana. The\
  \ fear of the unknown was dancing hand in hand with my self doubt and cold wind\
  \ chills. Every friend I spoke with, including my Mexican ones, thought that i am\
  \ crazy when I told them about going to cross Mexico and the rest of.latin America\
  \ on a 1984old Honda magna motorcycle. Crossing the border was much easier than\
  \ I thought. All I had to do is drive.  On my very first stop, after the border,\
  \ an old man came to me, said hello and handed me a piece of cake. This small act\
  \ of generosity, in hind sight, was the opening of what's about to happen in the\
  \ next 3 years. \n\nWhen darkness started dominating the atmosphere around, I started\
  \ looking for a place to sleep. I followed a sign ' aqua caliente' thinking of camping\
  \ next to some exotic hot springs. All I found was a night guard armed with a large\
  \ machete sitting next to a fire pit.  He looked confused when he saw me, but after\
  \ breaking my teeth and using my hands to explain that all I'm looking for is a\
  \ place to set up my tent so I can go to sleep. He showed me a spot next to a large\
  \ tree and even helped me putting the tent up. My own guardian angel.  The stories\
  \ about the deadly country was still fresh in my mind. I woke up fresh and ready\
  \ for another driving day.  The vistas I passed along the only road cutting through\
  \ Baja California south were mesmerising. From vast deserts with the largest cactuses\
  \ I have ever see to gorgeous beaches and voltures hanging out at every corner.\
  \ It reminded me the Sinai desert between Israel and Egypt. Minus the vultures and\
  \ cactuses.  after a few more days of cold desert Road I reached La Paz and found\
  \ a simple guest house that used to host the pilgrims on their religious journey.\
  \  I met Antonio, his wife and his two employees. They came all the way from Mexico\
  \ City to work on huge billboards for one of the largest fast food chains in the\
  \ world. Antonio and I had an immediate connection that would turn to be one the\
  \ best friendships of my life. What he was about to offer me was one of the most\
  \ vital circumstances on my three year adventure.  The amazing part was it was a\
  \ wish come true."
