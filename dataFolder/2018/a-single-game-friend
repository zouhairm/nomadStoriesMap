Text: "Staying deep in the concrete jungle that was the 18th arrondissement of Paris,\
  \ it was my first time abroad without parental supervision. Eighteen and just out\
  \ of school, I was now an adult and ready to take on the world.\n\nWe entered a\
  \ bar I'd spotted earlier on in the day, the main attraction being the snooker table.\
  \ The two of us invaded the empty open space building, the bartender happy to have\
  \ customers. We chatted away, loading coins into the table, requesting fresh pints\
  \ and thoroughly enjoying an easy night after three days of sightseeing and two\
  \ nights of partying.\n\nWe were about halfway through our first game, and well\
  \ into our third pint when he (or) she arrived. I never found out what they identified\
  \ as. \n\nBut that's the point. This isn't a tale about who this person was, it's\
  \ about the fact that that didn't matter. \n\nThis person chatted away to the barman\
  \ for a period and then began striding toward us. Wearing a skirt and a jacket over\
  \ their dirty tattered ballgown, they moved elegantly. They placed a shiny two euro\
  \ coin down on the table with fingers that had fake nails attached and nail polish\
  \ badly painted over both the fake nails and the hands. They smiled a near-toothless\
  \ grin, their tanned leathery wrinkles rising and extending all over their make\
  \ up caked face and balding head. \nTheir fifteen necklaces clinked together as\
  \ they twiddled at them with ring-adorned fingers; asking if my friend and I would\
  \ play them.\n\nI looked at my friend and we shrugged and agreed. We proceeded with\
  \ to finish our game and start over with our new local friend. We talked about nonimportant\
  \ things. What the beer tasted like, how the game of pool was going, how the weather\
  \ had been good lately. The three of us never tried to dissect or understand the\
  \ inner workings of each other. Instead, we choose to enjoy the company we'd been\
  \ afforded and count our blessings at that. \n\n\nWhen I tell this story to friends,\
  \ I tell it in a near exact way as to what I've written above. The point of the\
  \ story is not how I met such a strange character once in a Paris bar. If that were\
  \ the case, I would have chosen the 'the last thing I expected' theme. \nThe point\
  \ of this story is the importance of enjoying alien company without complication.\
  \ In this mad, modern world we live in that's hard. There are so many rules, so\
  \ many considerations to follow. That night, however, we saw each other as people\
  \ who just wanted a drink and a game of pool.\n\nThereafter, the rest didn't matter."
