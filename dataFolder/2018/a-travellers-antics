Text: "An extrovert travelling the world, so what is an extrovert\u2019s favourite\
  \ thing to do? Well of course meeting new people, making new connections and learning\
  \ from all kinds of different people. Sharing their stories and creating new stories.\
  \  So I set off on my journey, no matter where I go, what I do, I know I will meet\
  \ the most amazing people along the way. Even when out and about in my own city.\
  \ Not only does making these connections give me insight into a country, a place\
  \ or that person, but has even given me most amazing experiences and stories to\
  \ take home with me. What adventures have I experienced by making friends and connecting\
  \ with locals you ask? Well, I have on my many trips made friends, one including\
  \ bar staff in Thailand. These bar staff are the ones who prepared a special dinner\
  \ for us, yep just for us, that included dinner on the beach, fireworks, the lot!\
  \ But it doesn\u2019t stop there, I have made friends with resort staff who took\
  \ me, along with friends and new friends staying at the same resort, to a local\
  \ night club in Fiji. We met the locals and experienced a side of Fiji we would\
  \ have never seen otherwise. They do say travelling isn\u2019t just about seeing\
  \ the famous well known places right? Along the way I have met DJs who have taken\
  \ me to amazing rooftop bars, an Olympian, an owner of 50 KFC chains and many amazing\
  \ people. My favourite thing to ask when I am travelling, what do you recommend\
  \ we do or eat? From that question people have been willing to even show me around,\
  \ to take me to those amazing food places or to just chat. This has opened me up\
  \ to an amazing super burrito in San Francisco \u2013 a personal memorable moment\
  \ - local culture and the best meals I have ever had. When the journey is all over\
  \ I look back at all the amazing people I\u2019ve met and I can thank my extroverted\
  \ personality for allowing me to open up and talk to anyone. Facebook and Instagram\
  \ is a great tool for extroverts like me, with a simple add I can always connect\
  \ with those people who showed me those great places or recommended that amazing\
  \ dish I tried. Tips for those who want to start connecting to locals on their trips?\
  \ Always be open to conversation, if no one is really engaging with you, don\u2019\
  t be afraid to ask a question or introduce yourself. Don\u2019t think everyone is\
  \ out to harm you, but also trust your gut and always be careful. Make your own\
  \ stories by meeting new people. You never know who could actually change your life."
