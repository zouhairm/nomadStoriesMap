Text: "Before arriving in Tokyo, fluorescent vibrant lights, crowded street crossings\
  \ and Dance Dance Revolution came to mind. Due to the buzz of a lively city, the\
  \ last thing I expected was to find serenity at its core. \n\nAn exemplar, the lovely\
  \ middle-aged Nobu,contacted me online and we arranged to meet at Harajuku station.\
  \ We met in the heat of the day, evident by my forehead sweat ready to drip, while\
  \ sitting in the shade on a wooden bench. When Nobu emerged from the train station\
  \ exit, I was taken aback when I saw he was wearing a navy coloured blazer in thirty\
  \ three degree heat! \n\n\u201CAm I about to spend the day with a crazy man?\u201D\
  \ I thought.\n\nNobu had offered to show me around Meiji Shrine and the gardens\
  \ surrounding it. He was excited to be going at this time of year, as he expressed\
  \ the water-iris was in full bloom. I'd never been a huge fan of flowers, or gardening\
  \ at all really, but his enthusiasm made me reconsider how delightful it could be.\
  \ \n\nWe walked down the concrete path, that so many had walked before us, as Nobu\
  \ explained the history and importance that Shinto religion holds in Japan. I had\
  \ also heard maybe too much about shrines and temples. But you can\u2019t fault\
  \ how well-prepared his speech was. It wasn't until we got to the gardens that Nobu\
  \ had shifted in character. I could tell he was in his element. A place he truly\
  \ felt comfortable and at peace with. He told me he comes here almost everyday;\
  \ to walk, to think, and just admire the beauty that is Tokyo. For a second, I thought\
  \ David Attenborough had taken over him. \n\nWhen I asked Nobu if he had a family,\
  \ he said he had a wife, and a son that goes to university. His family never visit\
  \ the gardens. \n\n\"I'm the only one in my family that appreciates these types\
  \ of things\".\n\nIn that moment I felt close to Nobu. Not because of pity, but\
  \ because he was relatable. Something about a man from a different country, that\
  \ had a few grey hairs, feeling stifled to express himself really resonated with\
  \ me. Nobu had taken the time to show and explain his favourite parts of the gardens,\
  \ deeper than any travel blog could. A selfless gesture from a local Japanese man\
  \ to show that Tokyo\u2019s vibrancy is not only in the lights, but its beautiful\
  \ flora. This was an opportunity for a man to talk about something that he loved.\
  \ Something that he's probably told one hundred times over, but could do forever."
