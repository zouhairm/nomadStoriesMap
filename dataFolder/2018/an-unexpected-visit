Text: "It happened while I was in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea. My friends\
  \ were already way ahead of me and were out of sight when I turned off the engine\
  \ of the jet ski. I was getting rather sore and tired and I didn\u2019t know exactly\
  \ how long we had been moving through the water, going from one island to another.\n\
  I stood up a bit to stretch my aching arms and bottom when I noticed something strange\
  \ in the waves.\nIt was a fin, barely a couple of meters before me. Curious, I started\
  \ leaning forward to have a better look at what animal was exactly out there. While\
  \ leaning over the steering wheel, I heard a splash and some high pitched noises.\
  \ \nBefore I could see the source of the sounds up ahead, I heard a similar sound\
  \ only louder on my immediate right. When I looked down in that direction, a dolphins\
  \ head was popped up out of the water, right next to my feet.\nI jumped up, lost\
  \ my balance and almost fell into the water. You see, I had only seen dolphins (bottlenose\
  \ dolphins as I came to learn afterward), in dolphinariums. Never had I seen them\
  \ in the wild. In my opinion, in aquariums dolphins don\u2019t seem that big. I\
  \ always found them rather cute looking when they were doing backflips, or were\
  \ jumping out of the water and making happy noises. Another difference was that\
  \ you could watch from a safe distance in your seat.\nHowever, this dolphin was\
  \ not in an aquarium. Even with only the head out of the water, it was clear it\
  \ was a big animal, bigger than me and my jet ski. Its beak was open and the many\
  \ teeth were clearly visible and were way to close to my feet for comfort. \nAlthough\
  \ a little surprised and scared because of its unexpected visit, its close proximity\
  \ and largeness, I found myself fascinated by it. Slowly I put out my hand to see\
  \ if I could touch it. When it allowed me to touch its snout, I felt an adrenaline\
  \ rush come over me. So I started caressing its head. The dolphin made loud, and\
  \ ( I think) happy noises while rocking its head back and forth. \nThen I noticed\
  \ that there were two more dolphins nearby and got a bit nervous again. They were\
  \ chirping and coming out of the water with there full bodies visible, just to dive\
  \ back into the water a bit further away. To see them in their full extension was\
  \ an absolutely magnificent sight.  The three dolphins played around for a couple\
  \ more minutes before swimming away, leaving me alone again, a little stunned of\
  \ what just had happened."
