Text: "I was enamored, completely overcome by little details\u2014 the minutia that\
  \ I would have otherwise ignored on a normal day such as this. The leaves fluttering\
  \ in the wind, the air crisp with recent rainfall and my mind three to four steps\
  \ ahead of what I needed to complete that afternoon. After many hours of nothing\
  \ to do, I read as the breeze crept through the cracked french doors of my new bedroom.\
  \ The difference was that I wasn\u2019t at home. The room was not my own. The doors\
  \ were ajar; the sound of the birds kept me company. Nothing was truly familiar\
  \ but the clothes that I unpacked. As I laid out each piece of favorite attire on\
  \ my single bed, one after the other, I realized that I wasn\u2019t sure what I\
  \ was doing. I waved the thought away. Immediately, I realized I was moving my hands\
  \ as if the thought was personified next to me. I shook my head with a smirk. I\
  \ hurriedly put everything away in stale drawers not utilized for years. I unpeeled\
  \ the duvet that was recently changed before my arrival. I sat for a bit, then immediately\
  \ got up, quickly grabbing my wallet from the night table and headed out the door.\n\
  \nI was in Italy\u2014a small coastal town near Naples. The buildings seemed to\
  \ have witnessed centuries, yet the marquees were named with unfamiliar local brands\
  \ and United Colors of Bennington. Siesta had just subsided and everyone, it might\
  \ have been the whole town, was out and shopping for the food they would prepare\
  \ for their large family at their very late Italian dinners. My only purpose was\
  \ to pick up some more familiarities: another charger for my new phone, some gum,\
  \ and an umbrella. With no Italian, I utilized Spanish words thinking that at least\
  \ a few would be understood. Alas, some Napolitano people did not speak Italian\
  \ fluently, let alone Spanish. I did, however, get the things I needed. I walked\
  \ out of the last shop with small bags strung around my wrists and walked back towards\
  \ where I\u2019d be staying. As I looked up, I saw the sun had not yet set; it was\
  \ the golden hour. There was a golden hue hovering over space, object, and the living.\
  \ At that moment, someone tall passing by me caught my attention. He was at least\
  \ 6\u20195\u201D, with long legs, and the darkest skin that I\u2019ve ever witnessed.\
  \ It glistened as the sun absorbed into the depth of his skin. For that moment,\
  \ I no longer felt out of place. He passed me and as I admired his beauty, he slowly\
  \ turned his head and shouted just enough so I could hear him: \u201CCiao sorella!\u201D\
  . He called me \u201Csister\u201D."
