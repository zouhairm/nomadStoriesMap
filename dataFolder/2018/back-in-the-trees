Text: "After graduating with a Zoology degree last year I was lucky enough to receive\
  \ a 6 month internship at the Toucan Rescue Ranch in Costa Rica. It was a fast turn-around\
  \ and within two weeks of receiving the job offer I was packed and sitting on a\
  \ plane full of nervous enthusiasm for what was in store. My day-to-day job role\
  \ involved assisting the on-site veterinarian with caring for the rescued and injured\
  \ animals in the clinic. The species ranged from birds to mammals, each with its\
  \ own back-story and long list of issues. These included a malnourished, one-eyed\
  \ keel-billed toucan and a timid spider monkey who was confiscated from the pet\
  \ trade and missing several fingers. \n\nOn the day I arrived so did a large male\
  \ two-toed sloth. He had suffered severe electrical burns to his foot pads as well\
  \ as large burn wounds on his back and face. This type of injury is common in Costa\
  \ Rica as very few of the telephone lines are insulated and therefore sloths sustain\
  \ burn injuries when trying to traverse the cables. Two-toed sloths can be incredibly\
  \ dangerous animals. They have sharp claws and teeth and despite their slow reputation\
  \ they can strike fast. Despite his aggressive disposition I felt an immediate connection\
  \ with this animal and knew I had to do everything in my power to get him back to\
  \ his life in the wild. I worked closely with the incredibly talented veterinarian\
  \ to clean and tend to his wounds. As we watched him regain his strength we were\
  \ delighted with his speedy recovery. We were counting down the days until his release\
  \ when things took a turn for the worse. The sloth, now named Ricky Martin (the\
  \ sloths were being named after our favourite musicians), started experiencing fits\
  \ and lost the strength in his limbs. This shattered all of our hopes of releasing\
  \ this creature and as the vet had never witnessed these symptoms before we had\
  \ no ideas for treatments. Following many sleepless nights of research we came to\
  \ the conclusion that Ricky\u2019s symptoms could be linked to a calcium deficiency\
  \ seen in some human burn victims. With a prescription for calcium tablets (hidden\
  \ in food) the fits slowly disappeared although Ricky was left in a pretty bad shape.\
  \ We therefore started physical therapy treatments helping to support Ricky regain\
  \ his strength in climbing. \n\nOne year later Ricky is now spending his days in\
  \ a pre-release enclosure climbing by himself and preparing for a life back in the\
  \ trees."
