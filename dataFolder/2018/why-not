Text: "Watch a Filipino move and you will not see an acceptance of their fate, you\
  \ will instead find utter contentment \u2013 you will find tolerance and openness.\n\
  The Filipino\u2019s love foreigners \u2013 they love them and appreciate them more\
  \ than they do themselves.\nThis was something which had a scent of newness to it\
  \ for me. I have felt welcome in most countries I have visited but this type of\
  \ hospitality had something else \u2013 it had a genuineness that went beyond need\
  \ or desire.\nThe first ten days I was there were shrouded in what I called then\
  \ \u201Cisolation\u201D. I did not see a Westerner, a fellow white person, a wandering\
  \ hipster for  almost two weeks; not even in passing on the street, not on a single\
  \ bus, at the beach \u2013 you may laugh \u2013 what is ten days \u2013 ten days\
  \ is a lot when you allow yourself, even momentarily to use this time, albeit very\
  \ unwisely, to feel excluded. I struggled to find a depth in the conversation I\
  \ shared with the locals \u2013 I struggled to find common ground and for the most\
  \ part we discussed why we found the other so wonderful. It was painful to break\
  \ the wall that seemed to separate us, when we were both battling so much to connect,\
  \ to learn from one another. Only now, looking back and writing this, do I realise\
  \ that in the equation we both failed to solve I was the one that did not comply\
  \ with the rules \u2013 I was the error on the page. The Filipinos meet people with\
  \ something much greater than an acceptance of the other, they meet each person\
  \ with fresh eyes. They meet at the beginning. For them it is an opportunity to\
  \ learn more \u2013 to experience more \u2013 to be more, where for me it is a danger,\
  \ another threat. If I could see they way they do, my life may not be easier, but\
  \ I am sure my experiences would be better. In fact just by being around the Filipinos\
  \ made my life better.And so with all these tales of \u201Cwoe\u201D , it is not\
  \ very long before we look back and the loneliness is hidden in the clouds of experience,\
  \ the wonderfully full clouds of adventure and lessons learned \u2013 this afterall\
  \ was the exact moment that I received the push I needed to enter another world\
  \ \u2013 to fully embrace a culture I was completely ignorant of  - and no, I promise\
  \ I am not here to tell you about some level of spirituality I reached, or that\
  \ this personal journey brought me to God and to love and to light and hippie freedom\
  \ and all that\u2026\nI am just telling you that there is something in the way the\
  \ Filipino\u2019s move -\nnot with an acceptance of their fate but rather a contentment\
  \ in it."
