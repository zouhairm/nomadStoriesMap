Text: "A full stop to the phrase of snow was written by a damp briskness in the air.\
  \ Walking steep, cobble-stoned streets with the people I\u2019d come to refer to\
  \ as my French family, we made our way through one of the smallest villages in the\
  \ south of France. Christ\xE8le wondered aloud where a local artist displayed his\
  \ work while les enfants teased the name\u2019s proximity to the French for annoying.\
  \ Minerve was quite the opposite. Quaint. Quiet. Shy.\nIn the months I\u2019d spent\
  \ there, I don\u2019t recall anything more typically French than the contents of\
  \ the family kitchen. In the sleek, modern island a calico-lined drawer carried\
  \ a fresh baguette each morning. In the fingerprint-resistant refrigerator, what\
  \ I had known as a vegetable crisper back home held at least five varieties of cheese\
  \ on any given day. A slice of one with the other after dinner saw the bread as\
  \ stale as the father would allow \u2013 buying, breaking and spreading it with\
  \ jam only hours before. \n\nI\u2019d since eaten crepes by the Eiffel Tower and\
  \ listened to jazz in the streets of Bordeaux. I\u2019d visited wineries and ordered\
  \ bread \u201Cpas trop cuite\u201D (not overcooked) like a local. Still, the cheese\
  \ and baguette drawers took the g\xE2teau for me. \n\nMoments after emerging from\
  \ the town square \u2013 also moments after entering it, unaware of its significance\
  \ in its resemblance to a townhouse courtyard \u2013 we came by the artists\u2019\
  \ studio. Peering through the window like children at a bakery with a closed sign,\
  \ Frenglish discussion broke out as to whether we could enter. Reaching a conclusion\
  \ to the contrary, the classic painting of the French painter materialised. As the\
  \ figure emerged and conversation arose between he and Christ\xE8le, I digested\
  \ the image like one of the treats in that bakery. Chewing, mesmerised, each layer\
  \ delighted my palate. \nBlack trousers. \u201CBonjour!\u201D Black and white shirt,\
  \ horizontally striped. \u201CVous n\u2019etes pas ferm\xE9?\u201D Black b\xE9ret,\
  \ tilted. \u201CSi! Vous venez d\u2019o\xF9?\u201D My eyes fell between the shirt\
  \ and the b\xE9ret to find the most splendidly manicured moustache. Nowhere in my\
  \ life had I laid eyes on facial hair so comically styled yet so suited to its owner.\
  \ \u201CNarbonne\u201D.  The hair extended past the man\u2019s lips to the edge\
  \ of his face, curling perfectly at the ends.  \u201CMa copine est Australienne\u201D\
  . My national identity brought me out of my hypnotic state to fix gaze with the\
  \ artist, smiling in anticipation of a similar fascination at my exoticism. \u201C\
  Bonjour!\u201D I edged out of my speechless mouth.\n\n\u201CStrAlia?! Oi\u2019m\
  \ from BRISB\u2019N!\u201D Eyes widening, I was speechless again."
