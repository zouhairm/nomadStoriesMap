Text: "On the third of March I made my final decision, I applied for an Exchange.\
  \ \nI knew it would be an enormous challenge but also an enormous chance for me.\
  \ I finally realized I am doing it when I sat in the airplane to London Heathrow.\
  \ \n\nWhen I arrived in London I went to the \"Welcome Days\" in Winchester where\
  \ I met lots of other exchange students from Europe. I made some friends from different\
  \ countries and I also met my host sister for the very first time. After the \"\
  Welcome Days\" everyone headed of to their host families. \nI was so excited to\
  \ meet them and they welcomed me very friendly but I had not much time to get to\
  \ know them because a few days later I started sixth form at the local school. \n\
  \nI realised quite fast that it was rather difficult to make enlgish friends. For\
  \ two reasons, firstly they had a slightly different language than I learned in\
  \ school, for example instead of thank you they said cheers and  the second reason\
  \ was that they already knew each other from their previous school years. Luckily\
  \ there were a few other exchange students and my host sister and me joined them.\
  \ We had an amazing time together but after a while I realized that my host sister\
  \ tried to exclude me from the group. It was like a hit in the face that the person\
  \ who I shared a room with betrayed me. I was aware that our realtionship was neither\
  \ the one of two sisters nor of two friends but I thought we had a special bond\
  \ due to the fact that we were made sister for five months. However it looked like\
  \ I was wrong. \nI had a down but thanks to my family and friends at home and the\
  \ new made friends from the \"Welcome Days\" I did not give up and tried even harder\
  \ to make english friends. \nI eventually suceeded and we had such a great time\
  \ together and a good laugh.\n\nThe real plot twist came up when I had to leave.\
  \ I was so happy to see my family and friends back home again but I was sad that\
  \ I had to leave England with my new gained friends.\nWhen I was back home I started\
  \ writing letters with them, I know it is old fashioned but it has this romantic\
  \ touch and I think it is such a very good feeling to have actual letters which\
  \ I can reread.  \n\nAt the end I would describe my five months exchange as a roller\
  \ coaster. There are highs and lows with a lot of adrenalin involved. And when I\
  \ was finished I was really proud of myself and I was able to look back to a lot\
  \ of wonderful moments and friends."
