Text: "It was a typical morning in Bali - humid, sunny and noisy. My guesthouse, nestled\
  \ in a terraced rice paddy in Ubud, got a nice breeze as I ate my breakfast of fried\
  \ eggs and sweetened black coffee under the shade of a banyan tree. It was my first\
  \ time in Bali - my first time abroad actually - and Balinese life was proving to\
  \ be a shock to the senses. The hot crush of motorbikes, the din of taxi touts,\
  \ the pump of life and motion. Even the smell was different. The air was hot and\
  \ moist, perfumed with cloves. It was a bit overwhelming. At times I was unsure\
  \ of how to get comfortable with all the raw newness. \n\nAs I ate my breakfast\
  \ the owner of the guesthouse, Mr. Mawar, emerged from his studio and sat next to\
  \ me. He was a local artist and we often chatted about his work. Today he had something\
  \ different on his mind. \"Would you like to help me celebrate my son's birthday\
  \ later?\" he asked. \n\nI said yes without asking any questions. An hour later\
  \ I was sitting on the wooden floor of his house with six of his neighbors. There\
  \ was a stone pot next to us filled with a spiced meat paste and I was shown, mainly\
  \ through pantomime, how to apply the meat to a piece of sugarcane to form a skewer.\
  \ They didn't speak English and I didn't speak Balinese, but that didn't seem to\
  \ matter much. I suppose we worked on that floor making skewers for several hours,\
  \ sweating in the airless room and chain smoking cigarettes. After we finished,\
  \ the skewers were grilled over charcoal and the house was filled with the aroma\
  \ of our labor. \n\nWhen Mr. Mawar's eldest son and his family arrived they began\
  \ praying in the courtyard. The family was dressed in white sarongs splashed with\
  \ yellow, and each took a turn kneeling before heavy stone statues of Balinese gods.\
  \ The skewers we made were presented as offerings, and the courtyard was soon pregnant\
  \ with incense smoke and the gentle throb of the gamelan orchestra. Balinese gods\
  \ are drawn from Hindu myth, and they have a touch of the otherworldly about them.\
  \ When you look at them it is easy to believe they came from an ancient past, when\
  \ life was more elemental and closer to its source. But as I watched Mr. Mawar's\
  \ family pray in the courtyard, their gods didn't seem so distant from my own. \n\
  \nLater we all ate a meal of oxtail simmered in a spicy gravy. Mr. Mawar showed\
  \ me how to use my hands to eat in the Balinese way. \"Good?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes,\"\
  \ I replied, with most of the oxtail still on my face. \"It's the best thing I have\
  \ ever eaten.\""
