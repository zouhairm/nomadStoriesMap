Text: "Leila\u2019s home was my unexpected gateway to discovering the people and cultures\
  \ of Amman. Although by no means luxurious, her traditionally furnished and well-kept\
  \ apartment was for Leila a kind of theatre for staging authentic Jordanian hospitality.\
  \ Visitors would arrive to thick molasses-like Arabic coffee \u2013 a second cup\
  \ of which would guarantee insomnia \u2013 alongside a platter mounded with fresh\
  \ figs, dates, and sugared almond cookies. Normally these treats would serve as\
  \ gestures of welcome in any local home, but with Leila they were also moments of\
  \ baptism into her spirit of family. Cookies was doled out with stories about how\
  \ scattered her family was around the world. \u201CJust like the cookie crumbs scattered\
  \ all over my kitchen,\u201D she would remark with a contagious laugh and an intensely\
  \ loving glare at her less-than-tidy grandchildren.\n\nHer hospitality towards me\
  \ was much more than that of a host welcoming a new guest; it was that of a grandmother\
  \ welcoming home her grown son from abroad whom she hadn\u2019t seen in years. She\
  \ wasted no time delving into all her questions about my family, my world adventures,\
  \ my romantic interests, my future hopes and dreams. In exchange for my comfort\
  \ and ease with what I joked was her \u2018inquisition\u2019, she offered me my\
  \ own peak into the life experiences that shaped her: a childhood in Palestine,\
  \ the joys and tensions of life in present-day Amman, her cherished culture, and\
  \ of course her love for friends and family.\n\nDaytimes during the summer at Leila\u2019\
  s apartment were hot and sleepy, but it was in the cool of those arid evenings where\
  \ everything and everyone came alive. What typically started as casual dinners with\
  \ a traditional Jordanian dish (her lamb in yogurt sauce was my personal favorite)\
  \ would inevitably become long evenings out on the balcony exchanging stories with\
  \ what seemed at times like half of Amman. There was the sister who lived in the\
  \ apartment across the hall, the friend visiting from Egypt, the cousins from across\
  \ town, the former colleagues of her husband, the neighbors with a problem to resolve,\
  \ and anyone else who knew that Leila\u2019s door was always open and the evening\
  \ mint tea was always ready.\n\nThose were the evenings when I really learned about\
  \ the people and the lives that make the city what it is. Sure I could have stayed\
  \ in a hotel or rented my own apartment for the three-week stay, but no accommodation\
  \ of any star level would have ever offered me the same intimate window into Amman."
