Text: "Imagine a grass field the size of a football pitch with tables for 500 people\
  \ and decorations of golden butterflies, flowers and sparkles \u2013 lots of sparkles.\
  \ \nThis was the atmosphere in Muscat, Oman at that night\u2019s ladies wedding,\
  \ a typical rite of passage from Arabic culture where the bride celebrates the marital\
  \ union with female guests only. The official marriage happens the day before, in\
  \ an intimate ritual at home including both families. The bride\u2019s party is\
  \ traditionally bigger and louder, an environment where the absence of men allows\
  \ ladies a more spontaneous and outgoing behavior. \nIt didn\u2019t take long after\
  \ guests started to arrive to notice that minimalism is not included in the festive\
  \ wardrobe of Arabic women. After hijabs and abayas were left to rest on the white-and-gold\
  \ tables, embroideries, layers and shimmering details were revealed alongside jewelry,\
  \ heavy make-up and thick locks of brown hair. From young girls to elders, women\
  \ radiated elegance and welcomed each other with complicity and warmth. \nThe single\
  \ exceptions were hidden inside a black box placed next to the guest\u2019s tables\
  \ \u2013 the musicians. The only men present at the event were isolated inside four\
  \ black walls with no visual contact with the women, being noticed only by the sound\
  \ boosted through the microphones \u2013 sporadic interactions with the guests and\
  \ an entirely Arabic music repertoire.  \nWhen they announced the arrival of the\
  \ bride, all 500 pairs of eyes turned to the entrance gates. The exuberance of the\
  \ white dress could be noticed by even the furthest table and was admired all the\
  \ way to the stage, where the bride sat for the next two hours to receive greetings\
  \ from the guests. After dinner was finished, the musicians prepared ladies for\
  \ the arrival of the groom. Hijabs and abayas were put on again and he walked in,\
  \ following the same path made by the bride and making his way to her on the stage,\
  \ where they exchanged timid looks and a few words while photographers snapped every\
  \ angle of the encounter. \nAs I observed them from the staff station, I tried to\
  \ imagine what kind of relationship they had and if the wedding was as much of a\
  \ happy moment for them as it was for the guests. If the success of the marriage\
  \ could be determined by how good the party was, these two were in for the long\
  \ run."
