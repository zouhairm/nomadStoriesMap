Text: "Niroj stands. \u201CTomorrow,\u201D he says, \u201CWe are walking from Gorakshep\
  \ to Orsho. It will be around seven hours. There is also the optional walk up Kala\
  \ Patthar. The wake-up call for this is 4.30am. It will be about \u201320\xB0c degrees.\
  \ You will need a head-torch and warm clothing.\u201D\n\nOur group of twelve has\
  \ just been to Everest Base Camp (\u2018EBC\u2019). Everyone is tired, and most\
  \ suffer the altitude. I\u2019m one of three to volunteer to Kala Patthar. \n\n\
  Kala Patthar is a small trekking peak at the base of Pumori in Nepal. Its altitude\
  \ is generally recorded as 5,545m. It offers great views of Everest and Nuptse and\
  \ is therefore a popular addition to the EBC trek.\n\nIn the predawn, Kala Patthar\
  \ looms ahead cloaked in a mantle of black; a triangular silhouette against the\
  \ clear sky. Stars prick the dark, but their strength is diluted by coming morning.\
  \ Our pace is fast. We have overtaken the other groups on the hill, and their head-torches\
  \ nod languidly behind. My feet slip on loose scree. It is so steep that I hardly\
  \ need to stoop to steady myself with my hand. We pause for a drink, but the water\
  \ in our bottles has frozen. Cold settles into my body. I have already lost feeling\
  \ of my toes.\n\n'This is too hard. You should give up.'\n\nThe slope tapers into\
  \ a gradual incline as the track skirts the side of the hill. The respite is only\
  \ short-lived, however; the way soon becoming sharp and direct to the summit. Terrain\
  \ morphs into large boulders. I\u2019m small and need to pull myself over them.\
  \ Lactic acid burns up my legs, and anger bubbles in my chest. I didn\u2019t find\
  \ EBC difficult and naively thought I could stroll up Kala Patthar without discomfort.\
  \ \n\n'Let the group go up without you. You can wait here.'\n\nI\u2019m in a contest\
  \ with myself. The struggle is the struggle of always striving to be better. The\
  \ summit ridge of Kala Patthar is only metres away. I force my legs to cross that\
  \ distance, hauling myself onto a flat boulder at the top. The bright coin of the\
  \ sun slowly crests the serrated lip of the mountain ranges. The Himalayas unfold\
  \ spectacularly before us. Ama Dablam perches on the horizon like a knife, but it\u2019\
  s small compared to Everest and Nuptse in the immediate foreground.\n\nIn the buttery\
  \ light of sunrise, life is made simple. The distant snow-topped peaks tell of freedom\
  \ and adventure. I\u2019m grateful for being alive and being here. I exist, like\
  \ these rocks, this earth and sky. The world is open and impossibly large. I feel\
  \ as heartache a sharp longing to explore all of it."
