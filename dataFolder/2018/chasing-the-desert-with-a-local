Text: "Morocco isn\u2019t a classic bucket list destination. However, something has\
  \ always drawn me to the idea of walking around the Medinas and travelling deep\
  \ inside the cities of this North African country. So, last year I decided it was\
  \ time to go there. My only worry before buying a ticket was the constant warning\
  \ that Morocco wasn\u2019t a friendly country for women that travel alone. After\
  \ giving it a lot of thought, I finally decided it wouldn\u2019t be prudent to ignore\
  \ those voices, and, going against everything I believe in when it comes to discovering\
  \ somewhere new, I booked a group tour. Ugh, I know. Still, if it wasn\u2019t for\
  \ that tour, I would never have met Said.\n\nSaid was our guide for the entire trip.\
  \ Eleven days, ten cities, countless hours inside buses that crossed the country\
  \ to get us to our final destination: the Sahara Desert. When you think about the\
  \ local connections a traveler can make during a journey like this, you probably\
  \ would never consider the tour guide. However, without this particular tour guide,\
  \ I would never have understood what Morocco really is like. With Said the intimacy\
  \ was almost compulsory, as it was with the whole group \u2013 it was the natural\
  \ effect of all the time we spent locked up inside a vehicle. \n\nThe first time\
  \ I saw Said was in the lobby of a hotel in Casablanca. The entire group was waiting\
  \ for him, around 20 people. He was wearing a blue and white djellaba (unisex tunic)\
  \ and sunglasses. He saluted everyone while entering the building: the bell boy,\
  \ the security guards, the receptionists. Not a word for us, though. After 10 minutes\
  \ or so, he approached us and introduced himself briefly before saying we should\
  \ enter the bus that was parked out front.\n\nThat first meeting said a lot about\
  \ how our trip was going to be. Making us wait exactly when we were eager to go\
  \ out and explore, he made us all understand that, as tourists, we had to slow down\
  \ and let the universe that is this incredible and complex country to find his way\
  \ into ourselves. In order to do that, you obviously have to learn to listen and\
  \ respect their culture, something that doesn\u2019t happen very often in the Western\
  \ world.\n\nSaid\u2019s honesty and kindness towards his own country is what helped\
  \ me to see the real side of Morocco, not the stereotype. Running away from the\
  \ \u201Cpoor Third World man\u201D label that the majority of European tourists\
  \ clearly put on Moroccans, Said showed us his country with a lot of pride and no\
  \ indulgence. And made us want to come back soon."
