Text: "I am in Cancun for work.  Yes, I know that sounds counterintuitive, but I work\
  \ on corporate meetings.  For the most part, I could be anywhere, spending most\
  \ of my days behind a registration desk in the air conditioned cool of a marble\
  \ palace, but here in Cancun I try to remind myself why I travel.\n\nOn the days\
  \ when I have a late start, I take to the beach, water bottle, sandals, and plastic\
  \ bag (to pick up beach litter), in hand.  Here on the beach, I can leave the cacophony\
  \ of the attendees behind and embrace the sound of the ocean surf that ebbs and\
  \ flows like the warm wind around me.  Here I can pause to watch my fellow beach\
  \ companion, a brown pelican, gracefully ride the thermals, first ankle height,\
  \ then knee height, then, without much more that a shift in his majestic wing span,\
  \ soar above my head, all the better to spy the fish that lurk just under the aquamarine\
  \ and sapphire waters. Much like the surf fisherman I pass, they both come up empty\
  \ but go right back to casting.\n\nOstensibly I am out on the beach to \u201Cget\
  \ my steps in\u201D but, I am out here to refresh my soul, digging my toes into\
  \ the, at first, pillow soft sand, and then the gently pricking tumbled coral and\
  \ shells that wind up on the beach.  I stretch out my time there in the natural\
  \ silence, but as the morning and the walk go on, I encounter more tourist, inured\
  \ to their surroundings, cocooned in their blue toothed headphones and selfie sticks.\
  \  Is travel for them only something they do so they can post?\n\nToo soon my revelry\
  \ is replaced by the need to return to the hotel.  What were once warm, fresh breezes\
  \ are quickly replaced with heavily scented sun screens and the hint of stale beer."
