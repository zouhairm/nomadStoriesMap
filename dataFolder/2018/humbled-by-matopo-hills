Text: "The harmonic singing of morning birds underlined the rendition of the national\
  \ anthem and echoed off the cliffs of the logic-defying Matopos Hills granite mastiffs.\
  \ When I lifted my eyes to the rocks, I spotted an agile little klipspringer in\
  \ silhouette against the skyline, standing like a sentinel on a lofty boulder. There\
  \ I was, standing on the starting line of a 33 mile ultra-marathon race, deep in\
  \ the heart of Matopos Hills. Three days ago, a twenty two year old grudge with\
  \ my friend led me to take a decision that pushed me to the edge. The starting gun\
  \ went off and we trotted down the gravel road in a spirited frenzy.\n\nMinutes\
  \ later, we took a sharp right turn and faced Bulawayo City, the last bastion of\
  \ the Ndebele kingdom. The first rays of the sun lit the tops of the hills displaying\
  \ an incredible carpet of coloured lichens that adorn many of the rock surfaces\
  \ in a kaleidoscope of red, yellow, green and black.\nThe supporters along the road\
  \ boosted my confidence levels, I had accounted for at least twenty five miles of\
  \ the race. The initial enjoyment of the dawn was replaced by the constant throbbing\
  \ of the quads and calf muscles and a volcano in my chest that was ready to erupt\
  \ at any time. The yells of encouragement and downright lies by spectators, \u201C\
  Keep on moving, you\u2019re looking good\u201D, \u201CYou\u2019re almost there\u201D\
  \ re-energised my muscles.\n\nThen it set in. As human beings we have limits beyond\
  \ which we are likely to snap. Suddenly I felt like I was running through quicksand.\
  \ Pain was searing through my legs and I slowed to a walk. I tried to run again\
  \ but I could not. I knew I was not going to make it. While looking around for a\
  \ bail out vehicle, I felt a hand on my shoulder. I looked up and saw a dreaded\
  \ runner in Rastafarian colours and my face said it all. \n\n\u201CMove it Rasta,\
  \ you can do this,\u201D he encouraged me and kept running.\n\nI took a deep breath\
  \ and told myself I could and started running. My friend was way back and I was\
  \ determined to keep it that way till the end.\n\nOne last turn and the big red\
  \ letters proclaimed, \u201CFINISH\u201D in front of me. It was like finding an\
  \ oasis in the sweltering Sahara Desert. As I crossed the finish line, I felt a\
  \ contented pride in settling the grudge; I had more stamina and endurance. Either\
  \ way the mysterious landscape humbled me. The next day when my work colleagues\
  \ asked me why the awkward walking, \u201CI visited Matopos Hills\u201D, was my\
  \ answer and they nodded in awe with no further follow up questions."
