Text: "Admittedly; it hadn\u2019t begun well. \n\nFor a self-confessed travel snob,\
  \ a sudden but compulsory, family road trip south was not one I\u2019d sought to\
  \ add to my collection. After all, no amount of fanfare could disguise our Little\
  \ Green Isle as anything but cold, wet and dull.\n\nI\u2019d protested, of course,\
  \ more so because said journey would be the centrefold in a carefully executed month\
  \ of leave, thus dismembering all hope of exotic travel for a whole year.\n\nBut,\
  \ as there was a strong motive, I squeezed into the back of my parent\u2019s car\
  \ with half the contents of our household to travel Britannia\u2019s Backbone to\
  \ the Cornish coast for, I was reassured, a great family adventure. \n\nAnd we did\
  \ arrive in splendid fashion; if one can count falling head first out of the car\
  \ in need of a leg-stretch and bathroom break only to find tolls on the local facilities\
  \ and no change in which to pay. \n\nOne questionable restroom later and we were\
  \ roaming the streets for the local delicacy of pasties and ice-cream, which was\
  \ promptly taken by a kamikaze gull who\u2019d long since resorted to criminality\
  \ for an easy meal.\n\nHungry and miserable; I took solace in how the mercury had\
  \ been pushing twenty-five all morning which, even for Late-July, is seen around\
  \ these parts about as fabled as Good Ole' Nessie herself. So, as the self-anointed\
  \ guide, my dad coaxed us down along the beach with childhood tales of a real-life\
  \ pirate cave he'd declared his by finders'rights some forty years ago. \n\nWe clambered\
  \ for hours over rock pools and through the surf for this legendary site only to\
  \ find its end had most likely been via controlled explosion after health and safety\
  \ concerns.\n\nBe it my dad's grief-stricken wails for a cave whose existence is,\
  \ to this day, a controversial subject or the cheap thrill of delving through a\
  \ thin fissure in the cliff-face to a cove only accessible at low tide; I realised\
  \ this small, crooking fishing village had somehow filled me with more excitement\
  \ than anywhere else I'd ever travelled.\n\nBecause, it may just be Kanas, but there\
  \ really is no place like home."
