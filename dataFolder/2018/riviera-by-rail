Text: "\u201CAre we in Italy, yet?\u201D\n\u201CNo,\u201D she said with a quizzical\
  \ smile, \u201Cyou\u2019ll know\u201D\n\u201CHow?\u201D I asked.\n\u201COh, trust\
  \ me, you\u2019ll know!\u201D  She laughed.\n\nThe train from Nice to Milan begins\
  \ along the French Riviera, with it\u2019s stunning homes, azure seascapes, jagged\
  \ granite cliffs, and verdant hills.  It was fantastic and charming beyond my wildest\
  \ dreams. The scenery outside the train was punctuated frequently by tunnels.  It\
  \ was an odd intrusion on the experience - from light and beauty to darkness so\
  \ complete it was shocking.  The tunnels never allowed you to become saturated with\
  \ the beauty of the place and take it for granted, they kept you longing for more.\n\
  \nThe trip to the Italian town of Ventimiglia takes only an hour.  Near the end,\
  \ I looked expectantly for clues that we were in Italy.  Just past the town of Menton,\
  \ the train plunges into a particularly long tunnel.  Exploding into sunlight, I\
  \ instantly noted that the climate and the terrain had changed.  It was drier and\
  \ the trees were shorter, the hillsides were less precipitous and rounder, and the\
  \ first town we rolled through looked to have hundreds of greenhouses.   The southernmost\
  \ terminus of the Maritime Alps is obvious not only from satellite imagery, but\
  \ from the ground as well.  That spine of mountains appears to create more than\
  \ a political border, it creates a striking meteorological one as well.  \nI looked\
  \ expectantly at my companion and raised an eyebrow.\n\u201CWelcome to Italia!\u201D\
  \ she said grandly. \n\nAs we rumbled into the first towns of the Italian Riviera,\
  \ the terraced hillsides gave up their greenhouses and the ubiquitous red roofing\
  \ seen everywhere in Italy began to dominate the scene.  Older stone homes higher\
  \ up on the hills overlooked stunning marble estates down by the beaches, where\
  \ the vivid electric blue waters of the Mediterranean waited.  Through the middle,\
  \ the train ground to a stop in a typical cinder-blocked station, wildly and colorfully\
  \ adorned (or was it accosted?) in graffiti.\n\n\u201CWow,\u201D I commented, \u201C\
  Lots of graffiti.\u201D\n\u201CYes.  It\u2019s\u2026 edgier here.\u201D  She pointed\
  \ out a group of young men wearing the standard garb with skateboards.  They were\
  \ loud and raucous.  They could have been in any city, in any country, from any\
  \ generation.\n\u201CThey look pretty normal to me,\u201D I noted.\n\u201CNo, we\
  \ take everything to heart here,\u201D she said emphatically.  \u201CIn France,\
  \ those guys would be talking about art.  Here,\u201D she gestured at the group,\
  \ \u201Cthey\u2019re yelling about politics.\u201D\n\n\u201CAnd now, we must have\
  \ espresso!\u201D"
