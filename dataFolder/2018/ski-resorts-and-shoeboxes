Text: "The Bjelasnica region is idyllic alpine scenery, yet I find the landscape harrowing.\
  \ We pass derelict farms, shells of former hotels and deserted highland villages.\
  \ Hard to believe snipers operated from these hills not so long ago; we\u2019ve\
  \ been advised not to hike alone due to landmines. I\u2019m unsettled to come face-to-face\
  \ with the ravages of war.\n\nKatja, our local guide, reels off the numbers killed.\
  \ She was a teen during the conflict, joining the army as soon as she could. I feel\
  \ uneasy. We\u2019re the same age. She spent her childhood in a besieged city \u2013\
  often without electricity, food or water. She has fought, faced death; I\u2019m\
  \ the na\xEFve, privileged holidaymaker. War is not real to my generation, only\
  \ something encountered in textbooks or nostalgic films.\n\nDay four\u2019s hike\
  \ is particularly poignant. A ski resort without snow is a sad sight. Here, 30 years\
  \ ago, Torvill and Dean won Olympic gold to the haunting notes of Ravel\u2019s Bolero.\
  \ Ten years later much of the infrastructure of the region was destroyed by war.\
  \  Tourism is now re-establishing itself and the skiing is said to be excellent\
  \ \u2013when there's snow. \n\nThe final day takes us to the capital. East meets\
  \ west is a clich\xE9 but literally accurate in the case of Sarajevo. Katja leads\
  \ us through narrow backstreets.\n\u2018Stop!\u2019 she orders. \u2018Look right\u2019\
  .\n\nWe obey. A cobbled street twists through Islamic architecture, highly decorated\
  \ mosques, stone-built minarets. We breathe an exotic, enticing scent of Turkish\
  \ sweet shops and oriental coffee houses.\n\n\u2018Look left.\u2019\n\nWe turn.\
  \ The same street widens into an elegant European esplanade.\n\nSarajevo\u2019s\
  \ diversity reflects Bosnia\u2019s unique history\u2013echoes of both the Ottoman\
  \ and Astro-Hungarian Empires are evident. It\u2019s Europe\u2019s only city to\
  \ boast a synagogue, mosque, Orthodox and Catholic Church in the same square.\n\n\
  In the 1990s Sarajevo was a besieged city; today it\u2019s peaceful, diverse and\
  \ welcoming, yet recent history is in plain sight. Blasted, blackened houses remain\
  \ and most buildings are pitted with shrapnel. Colourful putty fills holes in the\
  \ pavement; a visible reminder of exploded grenades.\n\nWe load the bus before leaving.\
  \ I feel I have to apologise.\n\n\u2018Before this week I knew nothing about Bosnia.\
  \ I remember sending shoeboxes as a child but was too young to understand.\u2019\
  \n\nKatja stops. \u2018You sent a shoebox? We looked forward to those so much -\
  \ our only Christmas presents!\u2019\n\nFlinging her arms around me, she hugs me\
  \ tightly. An emotional finale to a thoroughly surprising week."
