Text: "backpacking experience at goa.. \nImagine walking through a lane in Goa with\
  \ Portuguese houses all around you, and chatter in local Konkani and Portuguese\
  \ filtering out of windows. The doors of these homes are open and families are happily\
  \ wishing each other with cakes and hugs. If you are wondering this would be a typical\
  \ day in colonial Goa in 1895, think again. The old world charm of Goa is not lost,\
  \ not yet. It lives on in areas away from the overcrowded beaches, shouts of drunk\
  \ men check women out and unlimited empty bottles of beer thrown around. If you\
  \ have seen all of this, and want to explore something new - discover the Old Goa,\
  \ discover Goa beyond beaches, alcohol and trance parties.\nRiver Mandovi flows\
  \ through Goa and drains into the Arabian sea right next to Panjim. The river is\
  \ beautiful and all along surrounded by a thick foliage of mangrove. \n\nThe name\
  \ of this exotic little island is Divar. Divar in native Konkani means small.\n\
  Before the island became an important symbol of Catholicism, it was an prominent\
  \ Hindu pilgrimage center. \n\nHow to reach: \nThe island is not connected to the\
  \ mainland by a bridge, so the only way to reach is through ferries. The ferry ride\
  \ is free and if you intend to take your car you need to pay  fee of Rs 10. \nOnce\
  \ you walk around a little in old Goa, it's easy to get addicted to its houses,\
  \ especially the ones from Portuguese era. These houses have the most beautiful\
  \ colors and textures\nWherever I go, I always seek out the best coffee in town.\
  \ The best coffee has two elements for me - great tasting coffee and interesting\
  \ ambience. Goa has many places which offer both.\n\nI can recommend a few here:\n\
  A. Bodega\nB. Urban cafe\nC. Hotel Venite\nD. Baba coffee\nE. Coffee Haven....\n\
  The legend around the Saturday night markets is rather interesting. About a decade\
  \ ago, a German had this idea and leased out land from a Goan man and started this\
  \ market. When the lease ended the Goan decided to retain the market but threw out\
  \ the German. The Saturday night market at Arpore is his third attempt and it's\
  \ certainly done very well.....\nThe market is huge and so is the parking behind\
  \ it. The market offers something for everyone. You can find the kind of stuff you\
  \ usually find in flea markers across Goan beaches, especially Anjuna, and can also\
  \ find more high end designer stuff. Most of the designer type shops are run by\
  \ foreigners and they sell stuff like clothes, shoes, jewelry etc. It's all quite\
  \ beautiful but also expensive."
