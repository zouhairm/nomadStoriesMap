Text: "When you\u2019re a kid, you\u2019re told not to get in cars with strangers.\
  \ But when you get kicked off a ferryboat onto an unfamiliar island in a foreign\
  \ country, you may have no other choice.\nMy sister and I were at the end of our\
  \ trip backpacking Europe. We had spent the past week exploring the Acropolis in\
  \ Athens, meeting our Canadian soul sisters at a beach in Mykonos, and then hopped\
  \ on a ferry to Paros.\nWe never did make it to Paros. Our only excuse as to why:\
  \ we were clueless to how the ferry system works. After missing our stop, we were\
  \ forced off the boat at the island of Ios.\nMe and my sister and our 40kg backpacks\
  \ waited for the ferry to open up to this island. We walked off and I turned to\
  \ my sister crying. I had planned two months abroad\u2014scheduling planes, trains,\
  \ and hostels. Now we were stranded and I had 7 euros in my checking account (a\
  \ fact my mother had kindly informed me of a few days prior). So I cried. And my\
  \ big sister\u2014in the same metaphorical boat as me\u2014did too. We stood on\
  \ this beautiful island surrounded by rounded hilltops and soft shorelines with\
  \ no idea what to do or where to go. And then a man walked up to us. He was jolly\
  \ and tan.\n\u201CDo you need a place to stay?\u201D\nMy sister and I looked at\
  \ him and then at each other. He had come out of a white van.\n\u201CNo, thanks.\u201D\
  \n\u201CI have a room for you with very beautiful views. Only 12 euros a night!\u201D\
  \nWe looked at each other again. This was a strange man inviting us\u2014two young\
  \ American girls\u2014to trust him. This was everything our parents told us to avoid\
  \ as children. This was our only option.\n\u201COkay.\u201D\nHe smiled and took\
  \ our backpacks, throwing them in the back of the van.\nThis man, who had introduced\
  \ himself as Nikos, was chattering away as we drove through the curves of the island.\
  \ He told us the island had just opened for the season, only a thousand people living\
  \ there year round. He told me not to cry.\nWhen we reached his place\u2014a legitimate\
  \ hotel\u2014he gave me a hug and said, \u201CAlways remember, after something bad\
  \ always comes something good.\u201D\nNikos was our good. We followed him down some\
  \ stairs and up some others, to our room. It was a quaint room with three twin beds\
  \ and a private en suite. But the best part of all was a pair of double doors that\
  \ opened up to a balcony over looking the Mediterranean and even further in the\
  \ distance was a faint shadow of Santorini.\nNo matter how much I had planned for\
  \ this trip, nothing could have prepared me for this angel in a van who rescued\
  \ us in our hour of need."
