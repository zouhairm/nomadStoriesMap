Text: Several years ago I went to Barcelona in Spain for new years vacation.Barcelona
  is an artistic city and you can obviously see it through the appearance of city
  and the people who are living in there.Despite differences that you can feel and
  see between Barcelona and Madrid(The capital) you would find so many interesting
  things in Barcelona.Barcelona is not a very big city,however,being by the Mediterranean
  sea making it really special city to discover.First thing that you can make connection
  with is the Artists who are creating sand castles and sculptures by the beach.It
  is like a show on sands and walking by the beach and breathing  the breeze from
  the see makes it really romantic moments when you are there.Like other cities in
  the world in Barcelona you can find so many attractions like restaurants by the
  shore and people are walking or running in that area.Barcelona wasn't like this
  before,I've hear from local people.Olympic 1992 in Barcelona was a turning point
  for this beautiful city and bringing money for this event helped Barcelona to be
  one of the destinations for tourists all around the world.I do remember Olympic
  1992 because of USA basketball team(dream team);first ti me in Olympic history the
  NBA players could participate in Olympic games.Olympic village,night clubs,restaurants
  and the other attractions by the beach is one of the reasons that tourists like
  to be there during day.sitting on the bench under the sun in January is really enjoyable
  and letting the sun rays going through your skins is really amusing.When I was sitting
  there I saw a boy around 7 or 8 years old with Barcelona Soccer team jersey and
  he was playing with his ball which was obvious that he bought them from Barcelona
  soccer team's stadium.I still remember the color of the ball which was yellow with
  combination of two tone jersey(blue and red) caught my eyes in the hassle of the
  area easily. I've turned my head to his parents to get consent to take some pictures
  from that little boy and I saw a scene which I would never forget it in my life.
