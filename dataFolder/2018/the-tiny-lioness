Text: "\u201COh No Lady, Please I cannot, 100 is so little.\u201D\n\nSeven words were\
  \ spoken in the softest of voices but the challenge was thrown down.\n\nI swallowed\
  \ hard. Did she notice? It was hard to tell as her sharp brown eyes never wavered,\
  \ never broke free from mine.\n\nHow did I get here?\n\n I quickly glanced down\
  \ at the iridescent sash of crimson that had only seconds before been fluttering\
  \ in the breeze causing me to stop and exclaim \u201CThat\u2019s pretty\u201D, a\
  \ rookie mistake I realized only after her slight hand had quickly released the\
  \ red beauty and promptly laid it across my arm.\n\n\u201CWell, I don\u2019t really\
  \ need this,\u201D and I hesitantly thrust my hand towards her.  \n\nShe wasn\u2019\
  t having any of it, \u201CBut it\u2019s so pretty against your skin.\u201D In a\
  \ flash the crimson was now deftly laying across my shoulder, \u201Cfor you 450Bht\u201D\
  \ her smile threw me slightly off guard and she knew how to use it well. \n\n\u201C\
  Maybe 200\u201D was all I could stumble back. \n\n\u201CNo, No, my mother would\
  \ be so sad for me, 400 could be OK\u201D, her open hand reached towards me. \n\n\
  I fiddled with my wallet; damn I really was no good at this.   \u201CI only have\
  \ 370 left\u201D. \n\n\u201CSo, Ok but only for you this time.\u201D  She looked\
  \ dejected, but there was a radiance coming from her.\n\nHands together we bowed\
  \ slightly to each other, respected adversaries before parting ways. \u201CSa wat\
  \ dee\u201D\n\nMy husband looked perplexed, \u201CYou know you were just beaten\
  \ by a 12-year-old?\u201D\n\n\u201COh I know, but look how it brings out my colour,\u201D\
  \ I smiled as I wrapped my prize across my sunburned shoulders.\n\n\u201CLady, you\
  \ like red?  Come and see\u201D The call rang out from a wizened old man as I rounded\
  \ the corner to the next stall.  Game on, this time I\u2018d do better."
