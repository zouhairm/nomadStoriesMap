Text: "A few years ago, a friend and I visited Palenque, Mexico (known to the Maya\
  \ as B\xE0ak' or Lakamha, which translates to \"Big Water\"), in the State of Chiapas.\
  \ It is a beautiful place to visit and has one of the best Archaeological zones\
  \ in Mexico. It is here that K'inich Janaab Pakal (The Great Pacal, 8 Ahau or Sun\
  \ Shield) set rejuvenating a city that was to last another 300 years, until the\
  \ collapse of the Maya. \n\nAfter a morning of strolling around the court yard of\
  \ the ruins, during a light, misty rain with, what I felt was, 100% humidity and\
  \ the calls of Howler Monkeys in the distance, we headed to the Cascades de Agua\
  \ Azul (Blue water falls). The falls were spectacular and you could envisage several\
  \ hundred Maya priests travelling there for worship.\n\nAfter seeing the falls,\
  \ we made our way to the front of the park where there was a small store that was\
  \ also a bus stop. We were informed that a bus would be by to take us back to town.\
  \ While the bus did arrive, it was very full and we were unable to get on.\n\nAfter\
  \ seeing another 2 busses come and go without being able to board, a panel van arrived.\
  \ The driver went in to the store, got a pack of smokes and, as he was leaving,\
  \ called out if anybody needed a lift back to Palenque. My friend, Maria, jumped\
  \ at the chance. \n\n5 minutes later we were heading down a steamy road (parts of\
  \ which were half washed away) in a steady drizzle with the cracked windscreen fogging\
  \ up (no air conditioning), me (I could only speak English) on a very wobbly front\
  \ seat held in by only 1 bolt, Jorge driving (who could only speak Spanish), Jimmy\
  \ in the back of the panel van (who could speak Spanish and broken English) and\
  \ Maria (who could speak English and French) sitting in the back corner of the panel\
  \ van on a drum of who knows what, wedged in by holding the sides and back with\
  \ hands and feet like a spider in the corner.\n\nFor over an hour we rode like this,\
  \ and while nobody could really understand anyone else, we had a great conversation.\
  \ Jimmy and Jorge were mechanics working part time in Palenque and were on their\
  \ way back to Veracruz where they were to spend several months on one of the oil\
  \ rigs in the Gulf of Mexico. Two great guys and just a small story of the many\
  \ people that we were fortunate enough to meet on our month long travel through\
  \ Mexico."
