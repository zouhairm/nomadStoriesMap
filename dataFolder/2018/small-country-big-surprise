Text: 'When i tell people that i came and went from Fiji they react mostly confuse
  like i came from another planet or dimension.well if you tropical beaches,good food
  and kind and beautiful people then you''re gonna love Fiji.start the day with walking
  to a beach you''ll find angels in bikinis from dusk till dawn (if you''re up for
  some foreign love;) which you''ll find a lot.i even met lots of German girls here
  enough  to invade Poland.you''ll find lots of tourist. here.then at lunch go to
  lunch from an unlimited choices i recommend a Fijian Lovo (thats the local bbq)
  and drank it all down with Fiji Bitter (thats the best fijian beer for me) now i
  think the best Fiji has to offer is not the beaches or the food but the locals themselves.you
  can go the beaches,clubs and the towns and you''ll  meet and have a friend (yeah
  even if you''re a shy one) its easy to make friends here.and the locals here are
  humble,fun,calm and with great stories to tell.and once you do good to them like
  telling your stories to them,buying a drink or just giving some cigarettes and have
  a laugh and you''ll be invited to their homes if you if you need a place to stay
  to.heck they''ll even invite you to their village,meet the tribe and the chief and
  they''ll  roast a boar,drink some Kava (which is there national drink i think) and
  have feast for you.no im not kidding this is no exageration its all facts.

  What you don''t  believe me!?

  Then i suggest to try and visit Fiji to see the beauty itself.dont worry its gonna
  be worth it.its no wonder that Sinbad the pirate wanted to retire here.'
