Text: "The smell. I didn\u2019t expect the god-awful smell. We were confronted with\
  \ a barrage of music as we reached the top of the mountain, arriving at Hebron village,\
  \ the sound seeming to shout from all angles as the villagers weaved their way among\
  \ us. Their waving black limbs were offset with brilliant colours and even more\
  \ brilliant smiles as they did so, but the welcoming festivities were lost on me\
  \ as I held my breath against the scent of their odour, that only got worse as they\
  \ pulled me into an embrace. Who knew they didn't use deodorant in the islands?\n\
  \nI started counting the days until I would return home as my ensuite was replaced\
  \ by a drop toilet. My warm shower became a cold bucket of water. The Bachelor turned\
  \ into watching the kids kick a ball between makeshift posts. Each night my volunteer\
  \ team made lists of what we missed the most; our laptops, water straight from the\
  \ tap, a mirror, Mcdonalds. And each morning I would pray for night.\n\nI couldn\u2019\
  t comprehend the villagers\u2019 unyielding happiness. They watched us as we shovelled\
  \ cement that would become the foundation of the water tank, those shy smiles exploding\
  \ into toothy grins whenever we caught their eye. And always the sound of laughter\
  \ as they joked in languages we couldn\u2019t understand. When evening came, and\
  \ the sweat and dirt of the day had been washed away, I didn't remember food ever\
  \ tasting so good. My list became shorter.\n\nThe whole village gathered for church\
  \ on Saturday, their beaten copies of \u2018The Seventh Day Adventist Hymnal\u2019\
  \ clutched to their chests, grinning as the Pastor began. Afterwards, to shouts\
  \ of hymn \u201C101!\u201D and \u201C47!\u201D the church would respond with a chorus\
  \ of voices by no means melodic, but loaded with such unadulterated joy that I couldn't\
  \ help but to try follow the words. And I understood their happiness.\n\nThe next\
  \ morning it was raining and I couldn\u2019t stop smiling. I helped the others paint\
  \ the water tank in the rain with this stupid grin plastered on my face. And I realised\
  \ this was home. The faces around me were more familiar than my own reflection.\
  \ I remembered my initial apprehension, how I longed for the comfort of home. But\
  \ it was Sunday and I didn\u2019t want to go.\n\nAs we embraced Samana, Rose, baby\
  \ Fifi, it smelt like the ocean, earth, sunshine. \n\nOn the plane ride home I caught\
  \ my reflection in the mirror. My hair was wild and untamed but my tan skin was\
  \ offset by the same full smile I had seen at the welcoming ceremony. I closed my\
  \ eyes as I started making new lists."
