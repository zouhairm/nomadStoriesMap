Text: "I\u2019ve never been as keen a cyclist as some of my friends, but a week-long\
  \ trip to Southern Spain sounded like the sort of thing I could handle. I became\
  \ a little more apprehensive on hearing that the toughest day, over Pico Veleta,\
  \ involved cycling along the highest paved road in Europe - but at least it\u2019\
  s paved, right?\n\nFast forward two months, to a little before dawn in the tiny\
  \ village of Capileira, to the beginning of day four on our pannier-laden bikes.\
  \ Capileira is different from the Alpine mountain towns I\u2019m used to. Rather\
  \ than steep-roofed but broad wooden chalets, the buildings are tall and narrow,\
  \ with whitewashed walls and flat red roofs. Even at 1400m above sea level, the\
  \ streets are either narrow or tree-lined to give more shade.\n\nThe early start\
  \ isn\u2019t just about avoiding the midday heat. We\u2019ve also been warned by\
  \ a local bike shop owner that our guidebook\u2019s description of the route as\
  \ a \u201Croad\u201D (let alone a paved road) is a bit out of date. As the Sun peeks\
  \ over the mountains, we reach the end of the tarmac, and continue upwards on a\
  \ dirt track that\u2019s far from ideal for our narrow tyres. On the tight switchbacks,\
  \ the jerky acceleration of tour buses has made huge lumps or reduced the surface\
  \ to slippery sand. It\u2019s hot, and getting hotter. I have to keep stopping,\
  \ but I pretend it\u2019s to admire the view, even though we\u2019re still well\
  \ below the tree line.\n\nA little after noon, and over halfway up, we reach the\
  \ car park where the buses turn around. The views here are truly stunning, with\
  \ mountains to our East and West dropping off sharply to plains of dry scrubland\
  \ and, in the distance, the Mediterranean Sea. From here to the top our path (it\u2019\
  s definitely not a road) is a mountain bike track of broken rocks. There\u2019s\
  \ been at least one landslide since our guidebook was written.\n\nWe try to make\
  \ the best of it, but we have to walk the bikes at least two thirds of the way,\
  \ and progress is slow. The top is deceptive - twice I think we\u2019re almost there,\
  \ only to reach it and discover that there\u2019s more mountain just around the\
  \ corner.\n\nFinally, painfully, we reach our destination - Pico Veleta. It\u2019\
  s nearly 6pm, the Sun\u2019s hidden behind a cloud, it\u2019s maybe ten degrees,\
  \ and the wind makes it feel worse. We dig out all the layers we can from our panniers\
  \ - still not enough - and huddle behind a rock. We discover that this side of the\
  \ peak actually does have a paved road, and we argue about whose fault that is.\
  \ I\u2019m cold, exhausted, hungry - and yet I don\u2019t regret a thing."
