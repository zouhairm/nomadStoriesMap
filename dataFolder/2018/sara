Text: "The best adventure ideas come when it is essential deadline is looming. Study\
  \ for a final exam or a day trip with a friend? Before I knew it, I was clicking\
  \ my seatbelt and commuted into Sara\u2019s comfort zone. \n\nWalking down the streets\
  \ of the Indian Bazaar with my pale skin and light hair, the glittery red shoes\
  \ in the store display made me imagine if I could tap them together that I would\
  \ be back in the soothing world of molecules and equations. I had to run very fast\
  \ just to stay still as Sara the Red Queen simply stood remembering a home that\
  \ she could never return. Through the looking glass, I knew that I would never understand\
  \ this side of Sara and was settling into my role as the court jester.\n\n\u201C\
  I have a surprise for you,\u201D Sara exclaimed as if she was unaware that the sensory\
  \ overload I was experiencing wasn\u2019t whirling around me fast enough. \u201C\
  Try this! It\u2019s my favourite!\u201D as she thrusted a wrapped package to me\
  \ from a street vendor. I hadn\u2019t even noticed that she had ordered and paid\
  \ from a line in front of a wheel cart. She looked confused on why I had not ambushed\
  \ her new treat.\n\nCautiously I opened the unidentified item to find a leaf with\
  \ glowing pink paste and a strange white bug (I\u2019m pretty sure if was a maggot,\
  \ but I was too scared to ask). Sampling the tiniest bite, I felt like I needed\
  \ to say something, \u201CYummy!\u201D It was even more revolting that I had imagined\u2014\
  worse than vomit. I couldn\u2019t escape her stare so I had to take a second bite\
  \ to convince her, and myself, that I actually liked it. I didn\u2019t think it\
  \ was possible, but the second bite was even worse than the first. When Sara wasn\u2019\
  t looking, I casually slid the delicacy down a street gutter and chased after her.\n\
  \nThe treasure of the day\u2019s adventure wasn\u2019t the blur of peacock colours,\
  \ glistening lights, enchanting smells and acknowledging my role as prey in this\
  \ unfamiliar experience. The adventure was the friendship\u2026and knowing that\
  \ my day with Sara was so much more than those unforgettable two bites."
