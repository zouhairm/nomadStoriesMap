Text: "This is my story.\n\nI've had 27 years on this wonderful planet. I'm lucky\
  \ for the opportunities I've had and I'm proud of the opportunities I've created\
  \ for myself.\n\nI wasn't the best student in school. Reflecting, I enjoyed my school\
  \ days, mainly the social aspect. I was given the nickname 'little miss flutterby'\
  \ by one of my teachers as I always seemed to be floating around. \n\nI was never\
  \ certain on a career path, but I knew my future involved travel. With average grades\
  \ I somehow managed to get into University to study Social Science with a Public\
  \ Relations major. I really enjoyed University. I worked hard, pushed myself and\
  \ did well.\n\nAfter finishing my degree I was incredibly fortunate to be offered\
  \ an entry level communications role. The role was with a non-profit aged care provider\
  \ and I absolutely loved it. Part of my role involved writing the weekly newsletter.\
  \ I got to meet amazing people who have lived inspiring lives then hear and share\
  \ their stories. It was then that I realised my passion for storytelling.\n\nThen\
  \ the last thing I expected to happen, happened. I fell in love with one of my best\
  \ friends. I think one of the reasons our friendship turned into something more\
  \ is because of our shared passion of travel.\n\nFor the entire duration of our\
  \ relationship we have fantasied about leaving our jobs and travelling the world\
  \ together. We both have world maps on our bedroom walls, we'd stay up late looking\
  \ at the maps and dreaming of the places we could go.\n\nIt was probably about two\
  \ years ago now that we seriously started considering if we could actually pack\
  \ up and leave. As I approached my 26th birthday I thought about all of the things\
  \ I want to achieve in my life and what's really important to me. I felt so fortunate\
  \ to have found a person to share my life with, who shares the same values and passions\
  \ as me. I can't remember the day we decided we'd go, but we started moving towards\
  \ turning our dream into a reality. \n\nWe booked our World Nomads Travel Insurance\
  \ and flew out on 23 November 2017. It's been an absolute whirlwind and today we\
  \ reach the three month mark of living our dream.\n\nAfter hiking in Mexico, learning\
  \ about the history in Cuba and swimming with sharks in Belize I write my story\
  \ from Lake Atitlan in Guatemala. This was last thing I expected to happen this\
  \ afternoon when I read about this amazing opportunity and sat down to write my\
  \ story. \n\nThank you for your consideration."
