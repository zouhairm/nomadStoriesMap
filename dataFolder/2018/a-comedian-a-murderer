Text: "Some experiences in life come and go without a second thought or lasting impression.\
  \ Others, well, they have a way of smacking you in the face and leaving a mark.\
  \ \nThere is a very well-known fountain at the Five Points in Birmingham, AL called\
  \ the Storyteller Fountain. A couple of my close friends wanted to take me to the\
  \ fountain while we were visiting the area because of it\u2019s photogenic appeal\
  \ and interesting back story.\nIt was a cool, clear evening in March, comfortable\
  \ with a jacket type of weather. Although it was dark out, the lighting was perfect\
  \ for a mood picture. We parked next to the Methodist Church and walked up to the\
  \ front of the fountain. \n\u201CDon\u2019t get too close to the fountain, the homeless\
  \ will think you are stealing their food.\u201D Said a voice from about 20 feet\
  \ away. We turned to see a man in his mid-twenties, wearing a less than clean grey\
  \ hoodie, walking in our direction.\n\u201CExcuse me?\u201D We all replied in unison\
  \ almost. \u201CJust inside the fountain,\u201D he said, pointing. \u201CIt\u2019\
  s where they stash the food they\u2019re given.\u201D\nA quick glance confirmed\
  \ his words. At least 8 to 10 Styrofoam containers of multiple sizes and colors\
  \ sat on the inside of the drained fountain. \u201CSorry man.\u201D We turned to\
  \ leave when he said, \u201CHey, uh, do you guys like stand-up comedy?\u201D\nUncertain\
  \ how to respond, we felt certain this was going to turn into a plea for money,\
  \ we decided to chat with him for a bit. It took less than 15 minutes to learn a\
  \ lifetime about this young man. He was, in fact, homeless, having recently been\
  \ released from prison, and had a strong desire to start a career as a comedian.\
  \ A witty comic, with no lack of material either, he used his prison stay as his\
  \ main source of material.\nHe was well-spoken and polite, but had a past that took\
  \ us all by surprise. During his late teen years, he served time for the murder\
  \ of his adopted father. In his own comedic way, he walked us through the events\
  \ of his youth. He explained that his father took the life of his mother, which\
  \ led him to take the life of his father.\nIt was pretty shocking commentary for\
  \ a Saturday evening. Oddly enough, none of us were scared or remotely uncomfortable\
  \ listening to his story. Here was a man with a horribly traumatic past, and he\
  \ was actively trying to live his life bringing joy to others through laughter.\n\
  This encounter was extremely eye-opening. I think it goes without saying that none\
  \ of us will ever forget our experience with this friendly murderer."
