Text: "Two fierce performers hugged tightly, bawling. The others unleashed themselves\
  \ into the distressed audience with the exactitude of lost children finally finding\
  \ their family members. \nI\u2019d never seen anything like this before. I was in\
  \ Segovia, Spain for an international theatre festival. \nHaving performed myself\
  \ earlier that day, I was taking it easy now. I was unprepared to be moved by something\
  \ I had never even pondered upon. The performance was a poignant depiction of families\
  \ torn apart during the Spanish Civil War in the late 1930s. It took place at The\
  \ Carcel \u2013 Segovia Creation Center. The Carcel is an old provincial prison\
  \ converted into a space for artistic creation. The actors moved around the premises\
  \ and inside the building, entering corridors, exploring prison cells, and portraying\
  \ atrocities faced by the people. The audience followed them around quietly.\nBursting\
  \ into tears, I documented the end of the performance with a picture as the actors\
  \ cried \u2018Mama,\u2019 \u2018Papa,\u2019 and other familial labels, hugging heartbroken\
  \ people around. The audience gathered its composure in silence and slowly began\
  \ to disperse. \nI made my way to the ladies\u2019 room for a good cry. \nI had\
  \ wept for a few moments when the stalls behind me opened and two girls let themselves\
  \ out. They were actors from the play and looked alarmed. In broken English and\
  \ with a generous Spanish accent, one of them asked why I was upset. Catching my\
  \ breath, I revealed that it was their heart-wrenching performance. She sighed and\
  \ threw me an affectionate look before putting her arms around me. Wiping my tears\
  \ with the tissues she handed me, I asked her about the War. I wondered if there\
  \ was something I could read about it. Her eyes lit up and she said she had something\
  \ she\u2019d want me to have. \"It would be like a gift from Segovia to you,\" she\
  \ grinned. She told me it was back home in Madrid but that she\u2019d try her best\
  \ for it to reach me before I left for India. We exchanged names and phone numbers\
  \ and I made my way to where I was supposed to go next. \nA week passed and we both\
  \ got busy with our respective purposes in Segovia. \nOn my last day in the city,\
  \ I visited the popular Alcazar of Segovia. I was climbing a dizzying, spiral staircase\
  \ when the phone rang. I was asked to wait by the main statue in the Alcazar garden.\
  \ \nCelia, the girl from the ladies' room appeared with a book. 'La Cascara Amarga,'\
  \ read the title.\n\"Sometimes you find special people in unusual places...\" she'd\
  \ written inside."
