Text: "I love road trips. I love to see what\u2019s beyond the horizon and that keeps\
  \ me going restlessly. It\u2019s not that there\u2019s something special necessarily\
  \ for everyone in it, but for me yes, I love it because it brings out the best in\
  \ me, losing my comfort once in a while, making me better in several ways.\n\nI\u2019\
  ve completed multiple road trips & there\u2019s not been a problem except for back\
  \ pain which is quite obvious when traveling on a motorcycle. But there\u2019s 1\
  \ trip that pushed me to the limit and more.\n\nAuli is a famous hill station offering\
  \ misty valley views and hill adventures and is a heaven for ones seeking a break\
  \ from summer or to be in a peaceful place to relax their stress. I, being the latter\
  \ one, along with my mate Syed, started this totally unplanned weekend trip. The\
  \ journey of 500 kms, given the state of roads in Uttarakhand not completely repaired\
  \ after the quakes and considerable area to be covered in hills themselves was a\
  \ breathtaking challenge and to add to it was rain. We were forced to defy all odds\
  \ with my Eleanor(motorcycle).\n\nWe started from Delhi at midnight to avoid traffic.\
  \ We cruised along swiftly and steadily until dawn, our only stop before this was\
  \ dinner at Murthal and now for a cup of tea. We covered 300 kms in 6 hours, 60\
  \ % job was done and we could see the lower mountains and the view was simply serene\
  \ to say the least with the sun just rising.\n\nThe route continued, we cruised,\
  \ vlogged, shooted, the hills when come, there\u2019s not a view you want to miss.\
  \ Then something went wrong, we came across a place where there was no vehicle except\
  \ ours, we kept moving. We saw multiple landslides, the road so thin that only a\
  \ small car could pass. Things got worse, it started raining which made the broken\
  \ road more slippery and then came our 2 nightmares, 1, we were almost out of fuel\
  \ & 2, the road ahead was menacing, constantly bumping for 20 freaking kms. Oh yeah,\
  \ 1 more problem, after coming this close, we didn\u2019t see a board for Auli.\n\
  \nWhat was wrong? Did we take the wrong route? No, we were on google maps. After\
  \ finally reaching a petrol station, I asked a boy, and he was like, \u201Cthis\
  \ is Auli\u201D. And us, like \u201Cwhat?\u201D And we finally knew that we were\
  \ on the route to wrong Auli.\n\nWe were humiliated, but that was how it was, so\
  \ we decided to go to Shimla, 120 kms from the Auli we went to, we reached Shimla\
  \ at dusk, went to hotel & in the mirror saw what we learnt, it was about the experience,\
  \ may be it was meant to happen, to let us deal with it."
