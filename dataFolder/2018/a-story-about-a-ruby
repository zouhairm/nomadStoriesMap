Text: "It all started with a second-hand watch I found floating in my handbag lining\
  \ while in Athens.  Its strap was broken so my friend suggested Kolokotroni street.\
  \ The sign outside the store was written in a faded indigo blue and read \u201C\
  Luria Orologion\u201D which translates to watch straps. Walking in, I was taken\
  \ by the smell of cigarette smoke, mold and leather. There were plexiglass boxes\
  \ filled with watch straps all around the tight space and right behind the wooden\
  \ counter, smoking her cigarette was Rubini. Her name means ruby in Greek and I\
  \ could not tell if the red sweater matching her eyeglasses frame was a coincidence\
  \ or not. When I handed her my watch, she took a long good look at me and started\
  \ picking through straps in a small box, delicately sorting them as if they were\
  \ of glass until she presented me with a red leather strap. \u201CDon\u2019t worry,\
  \ I\u2019ll make it fit. This is what I do and I love my job. Girls, I am not an\
  \ educated woman. I was only 12 when my kind boss took me in. At first, he gave\
  \ me a wet cloth and my job was to remove the glue from the straps. I sat right\
  \ there on that wooden stool but I was not allowed to talk to customers. The spinster\
  \ working here used to say \u2018You are too young to talk\u2019. But my boss was\
  \ kind. That\u2019s him!\u201D She pointed at a photo necklace hanging right behind\
  \ her. \u201CMy kind boss..I used to live near Piraeus, but I moved right across\
  \ the street. I never finished school, did I tell you this? Every time I go to the\
  \ bank or the tax office I ask someone to help out. I have been working here for\
  \ 45 years. This is the oldest strap shop in Athens you know! My kind boss left\
  \ me this place when he died and I never gave it my name. I have no right. What\
  \ a beautiful red strap! Look at it doll, it looks royal! Where did you say you\
  \ bought this? I don\u2019t know where Brussels is, I\u2019ve never been abroad.\
  \  Why go elsewhere? I am alone. This is the price you pay for loving what you do.\
  \ God doesn\u2019t give it all, but if you are lucky you get a job you love. Here,\
  \ take the old strap too, it's good, everyone should have a spare strap in their\
  \ bag. Keep it I insist! If you ever move back here, I will teach you everything\
  \ I know. Just like my kind boss taught me. Enjoy your youth girls. But love what\
  \ you do. Life doesn\u2019t go by without love for your work.\u201D I thanked her\
  \ and walked out feeling numb. If you search for the word \"ruby\" in Google the\
  \ top result is: Ruby\u202Fis a dynamic, reflective, object-oriented, general-purpose\
  \ programming language. Well, it's so much more than that, isn\u2019t it?"
