Text: "It\u2019s funny how the smallest of choices affect our lives. Had I not chosen\
  \ to enter a two-story squat in the middle of Barcelona\u2019s Gothic District five\
  \ years ago, I wouldn\u2019t have the same take on life that I do today. It was\
  \ a bold and perhaps a little silly move to have gone in, but it was a choice between\
  \ fear and trust, and while it\u2019s good to be rationally wary at times, how boring\
  \ would life be if we didn't take chances? \nI was alone in Barcelona that summer\
  \ and I couldn\u2019t resist the temptation of a new and illuminating encounter.\
  \ So when two friendly looking guys waved at me from the second story window of\
  \ an old building in a busy street, I waved back.\nAfter shouting back and fourth,\
  \ I took up their invitation to come inside. I\u2019ve always thought myself a decent\
  \ judge of character, but I have to admit a little doubt crept into me as I made\
  \ my way up the back alley and through the pitch-black entrance to the dilapidated\
  \ building. The older man lead me up a rickety staircase over the dark clutter that\
  \ inevitably accumulates in such an old place. My doubt didn\u2019t grow into foreboding\
  \ though, in fact, it receded with the dark as I reached the top of the stairs and\
  \ stepped out into an open, sunlit room.\nIt wasn\u2019t a luxurious place; unless\
  \ you compare it to some other squats I\u2019ve had the displeasure of entering.\
  \ But it was a home. The younger man from the window strummed dreamy tunes on a\
  \ beautiful, well-loved guitar \u2013 clearly his most precious, if not only possession.\
  \ A boy, around 11 years old, played video games on an outdated Gameboy. Sounds\
  \ from the street below drifted in through the open window, beyond which the detail\
  \ of the gothic towers and cobbled streets shone resplendent in the sun.\nThe older\
  \ man had a quirky, nomadic air that made him appear wise, like a character from\
  \ The Alchemist. He seemed connected to some greater, as yet undiscovered world.\
  \ The younger man and his son spoke no English, but somehow we were able to communicate,\
  \ as if we all drifted on the same tide and therefore knew the direction the other\
  \ was going. \nWe talked about the world, its light and its darkness. We waxed philosophical\
  \ and shared stories and songs. I stayed until the sun went down and left knowing\
  \ that I would never see them again. But I carried the value of our collective experiences\
  \ out with me; value that has seeped into my intuition and reminds me that if I\
  \ ever do make the wrong decision and all goes wrong, I can always go and live in\
  \ a squat in Barcelona."
