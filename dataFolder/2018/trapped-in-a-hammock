Text: "My lungs burned. The pressure in my head built as I ascended to eleven thousand\
  \ feet. I needed to stop before I passed the tree line. I stumbled upon a grove\
  \ that had trees perfect for my hammock. The slope would protect me from the wind\
  \ on one side. I looked forward to a peaceful night of stargazing and rest before\
  \ heading even farther up the mountain tomorrow. The trail split at the pass. I\
  \ would take a right at the fork and continue on for another two days. Oxygen deprivation\
  \ would be a small price to pay for this experience. But as I prepared for bed the\
  \ throbbing behind my eyes wouldn\u2019t stop. If I turned left at the junction\
  \ I could get back to town and avoid the highest passes. I wanted rest. I had plenty\
  \ of books to read, chocolate to eat. I gazed at the stars as I faded off to sleep,\
  \ envisioning an easy day in town.\nI woke to my tarp rustling. I was in bear country\
  \ but I had been careful with my food so I told myself that I was paranoid and drifted\
  \ back to sleep. I woke again to the same odd rustling. My rational mind believed\
  \ that I was okay but I needed proof. I reached to my right and pushed against my\
  \ tarp. Something pushed back.\nI was stuck. Something was six inches away and masked\
  \ by a thin piece of nylon. The slope that protected me from the wind blocked my\
  \ escape. I waited until the tarp went slack while convincing myself it was nothing.\
  \ When something brushed against my back I grabbed my light and trained it on the\
  \ ground. A giant porcupine.\nI convinced myself that he was just passing through\
  \ but when I felt a tug on my hammock and saw his head resting next to my feet I\
  \ screamed. Unphased, he walked away. I was on high alert until dawn but he never\
  \ came back. Sometime around dawn I drifted off to sleep. When I woke I saw the\
  \ quills that he left in my hammock and knew last night hadn\u2019t been a dream.\
  \ My stomach knotted up; there hadn\u2019t been space for negative thoughts during\
  \ the night but in the safety of the day I felt all the panic I had neglected. If\
  \ I stayed here I would live in fear of the porcupine. If I pressed on I would do\
  \ so with a confidence gained by pushing through my fear.\nI had to continue. I\
  \ would push myself up and down these mountains. I would be tired from exertion,\
  \ not sleep deprivation. I would continue with the knowledge that I didn\u2019t\
  \ let fear control me. As I soaked in the view at the top of each pass and explored\
  \ each meadow in the valleys I thanked the porcupine for giving me the confidence\
  \ to push onwards."
