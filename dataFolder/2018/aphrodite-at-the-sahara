Text: "The air is sticky and it is hot in the bus, when I take the step inside. So\
  \ far, there are mostly just Moroccan people travelling from Agadir to Marrakesh\
  \ and only few tourists, including me. It is going to be an 8 hours trip through\
  \ the desert, parts of the Sahara, while sun is standing in zenith. \n\nI am taking\
  \ a free seat closer to front, while the bus driver is loading last bottles of water\
  \ next to his seat. A quick guess would say around five-teen bottles, each one and\
  \ a half litres.\n\nLooking out the window, the landscape appears in monotone, long\
  \ stretched hills, few bushes and cactus. The street is more like a dirt or sand\
  \ road and once in a while another car is passing. \nYou can tell that everyone\
  \ is tired, even thinking is slow and tough. I am wondering how the bus driver is\
  \ managing the demanding trip.  My thoughts are drifting to the amount of water\
  \ bottles on the floor. Either the driver has still to return to Agadir on the same\
  \ day and he keeps hydrated. Or, and more likely, they are for sale for thirsty\
  \ passengers.\n\nThere is no air conditioning. Before heading to our destination,\
  \ some little girls entered the bus trying to sell some handheld fans. I wished\
  \ I had bought one. We are all sweating, some people are sleeping, others are trying\
  \ to move air. \n\nThe eyes are little, it is hard to keep them open, until something\
  \ is catching my attention. Through the windshield window, I can see three people\
  \ walking next to the road, here in the middle of nowhere. The bus driver is slowing\
  \ down, maybe he is going to stop to give them a ride. But he continues driving\
  \ slowly, leaning over to pick a water bottle and to throw it out of the open side\
  \ window. \nThe same happens around twenty minutes later, when again, we are passing\
  \ someone who is walking along the road. \n\nIt can be surprising to observe such\
  \ an act of \u201Cwatering\u201D for the first time, especially if someone is used\
  \ to have drinkable water almost everywhere at any time. In several countries and\
  \ cultures, it is something commonly certain locals advising to stay hydrated and\
  \ offering water to anybody. The cause is a big impact for awareness, how people\
  \ in countries with only few water reserves are dealing with those circumstances.\n\
  \nTravelling through Morocco was a great pleasure, especially seeing that when it\
  \ comes to basic, we all are like animals around the water hole, peacefully joined\
  \ together, no matter the race, size or wealth, sharing the one thing most essential."
