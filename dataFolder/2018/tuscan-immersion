Text: "I went to Tuscany because those gold rolling hills with cypress trees appealed\
  \ to me deeply, as they appeal to the many people drawn there. I went there to escape\
  \ a slightly traumatic past life left in London, to a magic land known for wine\
  \ and Renaissance art, where people appreciate the simple pleasures of life, like\
  \ a slice of pecorino on pane Toscano. However I did not want to just \u201Cbe\u201D\
  \ there; I wanted to throw myself into Tuscan living. I wanted to live and labour\
  \ amongst the locals and to get to the marrow of what it means to be a Tuscan. \n\
  \nHence for one month I worked on a biodynamic winery near San Miniato, a small,\
  \ Medieval town perched upon hilltops between Florence and Pisa, a town famous for\
  \ its precious white truffles, \u201Ctartufo bianco\u201D. My arrival was sweaty\
  \ and stressful as Francesco, the winemaker, failed to pick me from the dusty rail\
  \ station and I was forced to loiter there alone with a burdensome backpack for\
  \ most of the afternoon. This was to be one of many lessons in Italian disorganisation,\
  \ and a lesson that led to my eventual rescue by Giovanni, the taxi driver.\n \n\
  Francesco redeemed himself. But not until after I disliked him slightly more due\
  \ to the unexpected intensity of the labour. Everyday we, the workers, arose at\
  \ six and toiled under the blazing sun until the blessed sound of the bell tower\
  \ would strike twelve. I wondered what I was doing there. The exhaustion, however,\
  \ would then be washed away with the dirt off aching limbs in a cool shower. A shower\
  \ followed by a lunch of spaghetti doused in the peppery taste of oil from the first\
  \ press of the olives off the trees that could be seen from the kitchen window.\
  \  \n \nI came to not mind the labour. To me there is no more immersive way to experience\
  \ a place than to let one\u2019s own sweat drip into the soil while assisting the\
  \ locals in the shaping of the land. I learnt about the rural, Tuscan, way of life.\
  \ I learnt about working hard during the day and then enjoying the balmy summer\
  \ nights that followed. I learnt to truly enjoy the simple pleasures of life and\
  \ how precious and important it is to do so. \n\nThree years later I bumped into\
  \ Francesco at the Raw Wine fair in New York City. It took only a second for him\
  \ to recognise me before he exclaimed \u201CAHH PENELOPE!\u201D and embraced me.\
  \ I looked from his tanned face to the glowing colour of the 80% Trebbiano Toscano,\
  \ and was transported away from the greyness of the city back to the vines on those\
  \ golden rolling hills with the cypress trees."
