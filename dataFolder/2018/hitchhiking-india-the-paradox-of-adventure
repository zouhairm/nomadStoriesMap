Text: "Adventure is a funny thing; it is that which we seek to feel alive but in its\
  \ nature inherently challenges our opportunity to do so.\n\nWhen I decided to hitchhike\
  \ the Leh-Manali highway I was well aware of the risks involved- that\u2019s why\
  \ I did it. I could have taken a bus, taxi or flown straight from KTM, but there\
  \ was something appealing about the risk and uncertainty involved in a 3-day hitchhiking\
  \ journey along one of the world\u2019s highest motorable roads. \n\nStranded atop\
  \ the Tanglang La pass, 5300m above sea level, taking shelter on the roof of a 49\
  \ ton transport truck, my face wrapped in a scarf and body in a blanket, basking\
  \ in the grey abyss of another whiteout, I was content, elated by the snowy peaks\
  \ of the Zanskari mountain range and the freedom of the moment.\n\nBut it was more\
  \ than Himalayan greatness and high altitude that took my breath away. It was one\
  \ of those moments that leads people to rave on about India for decades after they\
  \ leave. A moment of awe; an experience of such perceptual vastness you literally\
  \ have to reconfigure your mental models of the world to comprehend it. These are\
  \ the moments when I fall in love with being alive.  \n\nIndia has a way of doing\
  \ that to people- leaving them awestruck, in love with living. A country of 1.3\
  \ billion, population density of 382 people per square kilometer, and home to the\
  \ world\u2019s largest democracy, the streets of India certainly do not lack stimulation\
  \ or vibrance. India comes with a special magic that enables travellers to feel\
  \ the greatest joy they\u2019ve ever experienced in the same moment it reminds them\
  \ of their own mortality and leaves them wishing they were anywhere else than their\
  \ place at present. \n\nWhat you find in India is never quite as you expect it to\
  \ be. But for the adventurous spirit, India is a treasure chest of potential. \n\
  \n\u201CMam, are you okay?\u201D \n\nI rolled on my back to the sight of a beautiful\
  \ Ladakhi lady staring down at me. It was only an 8 ft drop from the top of the\
  \ truck to the ground but it felt like more. I didn\u2019t expect to get in a fight\
  \ with Setar the driver, nor did I expect him to push me off the top of his truck\
  \ and leave me lying on a roadside. I reached my hand downwards to investigate.\
  \ Sill there, unbloodied and unharmed.\n\nLaying on the ground indulging in my self-defeat\
  \ I asked myself: \u201Cwhy do I do this?\u201D \n\nAnd then I remembered: \u201C\
  because I made a choice to live\u201D\n\nTherein lies the paradox of adventure:\
  \ what we seek to feel alive challenges our life in its very nature."
