Text: "Travelling to England to watch live sport has always in my life\u2019s plan.\
  \ Seated at Wembley, Lords, Twickenham has been a dream of mine since I fell in\
  \ love with sport as a young boy from Cape Town.Throughout my teens, focus shifted\
  \ between professional football and playing field hockey. Intrigued by the former\
  \ as well as a burning desire for Liverpool Football Club, I made it my life\u2019\
  s goal to somehow get to England and watch the Reds play \u2013 my life would be\
  \ complete!\nThe stars had aligned, I\u2019d said all prayers, taken most of my\
  \ vitamins and two years after finishing high school I found myself with a chance\
  \ of winning a competition that would my lifelong dream come true. This was my chance\
  \ and I was not prepared to miss out on. At 21-years of age I had never been overseas\
  \ before and this felt like a \u201Cnow or never\u201D moment. I had to grab this\
  \ chance with both hands and hold on for dear life. The prize of the competition;\
  \ an all-expenses-paid trip across the pond to watch a football match live in England.\
  \ Not just any match, the match! A rivalry as old as time. England\u2019s two most\
  \ successful clubs; Manchester United vs Liverpool FC. Was this a dream that I had\
  \ yet to awake from?\nIt was no dream at all. Just like that I was seated on a plane\
  \ heading to Old Trafford to watch The Reds of Liverpool take on The Red Devils\
  \ of Manchester. Soaking in every minute as if it were my last, England was everything\
  \ that I imagined to be. The sights, the accents, even the weather \u2013 I was\
  \ overwhelmed. That is until I was sitting next to my dad inside \u2018The Theatre\
  \ of Dreams\u2019 waiting for my idols to take to the pitch.\nFinally, it was time\
  \ for the teams to walk out of the tunnel and onto the pitch and I could not contain\
  \ myself any longer. The lads I had seen every week on the tele were right in front\
  \ of my very eyes but there was one problem: I was sat in the home end surrounded\
  \ by the United faithful.\nA pretty partisan crowd but this is what I had dreamt\
  \ of. I was going to make the most of this amazing experience. We were trailing\
  \ and had hit back with a beautiful overhead kick that rocketed into the top corner.\
  \ Forgetting my surroundings, I leapt up in celebration of what I had just seen\
  \ and that\u2019s when I had made my local connection; do not celebrate a Liverpool\
  \ goal at Old Trafford unless you\u2019re seated in the travelling fans\u2019 section.\
  \ I proceeded to mouth off at the Liverpool players as if I were a lifelong Manchester\
  \ United fan. Talk about wrong place, wrong time."
