Text: "Little did I imagine that the Spanish loved celebrating so much! My uncle,\
  \ who'd been living in Europe for years, received me in his cosy little house in\
  \ Las Navas del Marqu\xE9s, a 2-hour-drive from Barajas Airport, Madrid. His woman,\
  \ an open-minded artist with a sharp vision of life, a native to these far-away\
  \ lands, welcomed me and my hunger for the unknown. \nOn the night of the 31st December,\
  \ what the Spanish call \"Noche Vieja\", as it's clearly the last night of the year,\
  \ I was offered a banquet that only the Gods can afford to enjoy, and yet I was\
  \ bestowed! Salmon and trout, red wine -and white as well- cheeses of all kinds\
  \ matched with the most delectable types of hams (Iberian ham, flavored and roasted\
  \ ones), \"chorizos\", salami and whatnot. My palate was absolutely making the most\
  \ out of such wide variety of flavors. The company, oh! More than I could've asked\
  \ for:\n-Say, how do you like the \"paella\"?\n-It's beyond words! Fish galore.\n\
  -And the \"tortilla\"?- asked Maria del Pilar, born and bred in Madrid. \n-New to\
  \ me! I've never tried something similar before. \nWe all laughed, and were high\
  \ in spirits. The night slowly crawled towards its half, and once the main courses\
  \ were done, we were all ready to have a bite of the Spanish pastries and candies.\
  \ \"Polvorones\" here, \"turrones\" there. Everything was accompanied by  \"sidras\"\
  , which my uncle served in the air. Yes, in the air! He kept a glass in his left\
  \ hand as he lifted the bottle and poured the yellow liquid from above, leaving\
  \ both arms widely stretched. \n-The secret,- he said handing the golden beverage\
  \ to me- is to drink it right away: don't place the glass on the table, because\
  \ it's customary. \nStill, the most exciting part of the night was yet to come:\
  \ just before midnight, the Spanish people pay close attention to the 12 seconds\
  \ before the new year. Believe me, you'd better pay close attention too! Maria del\
  \ Pilar, already slightly drunk, in total bliss, gave me a bowl with 12 grapes.\
  \ \n-Now, you must eat one grape every time the bell rings, and you must hurry,\
  \ so that when it's 12 o'clock all the grapes are already swallowed! \n-What?- I\
  \ said, laughing.- You guys have such challenging habits! \n-It's almost the time,\
  \ get ready! - My uncle's voice said from the kitchen as he served more \"turrones\
  \ de alicante\" on a plate. \nSo, the race to a brand new year began: 12... a grape's\
  \ inside my mouth! 11... 10...9...I'm full! And so on, until my face was not only\
  \ filled with them, but with happiness too."
