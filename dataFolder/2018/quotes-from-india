Text: "No one can ignore the position of Indian culture among the worldwide cultures.\
  \ At the same time, It is hard to judge the Indian culture and how the Indian people\
  \ live their daily life from the media only. It is so important to encounter the\
  \ daily life in India to take an impression on this amazing culture. It was a great\
  \ chance to experience a live situation in New Delhi when I get a chance to travel\
  \ there in November 2013.\n\nI hear a lot that there is violence in the streets\
  \ and so most of the markets close at 10 P.M. When I went for shopping in New Delhi.\
  \ I asked one of the Indian friends where I can change money with best price. He\
  \ told me that: \"It is easy to change money anywhere, just ask the hotel reception\"\
  .\n\nWhen I asked the hotel clerk, he told me that you can change US Dollars from\
  \ the street next to the hotel, I thought that I will find a currency exchange office,\
  \ but It was a surprise for me to find an old man sitting on a chair next to a big\
  \ glass box full of Indian Rupee. I wondered and asked myself If that old man was\
  \ not afraid of robbery. I asked the price, he said that \"One US Dollar will cost\
  \ 57 Rupees\". It was not a good price and asked him a better offer but he refused.\
  \ At last, he advised me to go an official office that require a passport and wrote\
  \ me the name and address. \n\nWalking down the Indian streets, impressed with the\
  \ mixture of Indian legacy in the buildings and asking people on the right address,\
  \ I finally found the exchange office. Unfortunately, I found it was closed although\
  \ it was afternoon. A security guard with a big gun standing next to the door asked\
  \ me why I am standing there. I replied that I want to change Dollars. He asked\
  \ me about my passport. He took it, rang a bell next to him. The door opened and\
  \ another security guard with a big gun looked at me then talk with the first guard,\
  \ took the passport and closed the door leaving me in the street and closed the\
  \ door! 15 minutes later, he let me enter after a self-inspection and closed the\
  \ door again. Surprisingly, the office was full of employee. \n\nSpending more than\
  \ 45 minutes, I had to fill information in six papers to be able to change the money.\
  \ Honestly, I blamed myself to go there. But finally, I changed the US dollars with\
  \ 61 Indian Rupee. The manager of the office brought me the passport with big smile\
  \ and much respect.\n\nIt was a great experience to know that how people manage\
  \ their life differently and more important not to judge a culture in one side."
