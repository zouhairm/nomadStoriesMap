Text: "They say practice makes perfect and often just as I\u2019m learning how to\
  \ get around proficiently, it\u2019s time to go home. Over New Years I travelled\
  \ to New Caledonia, \xE0 French Pacific Island for a couple of weeks with my gluten\
  \ free boyfriend. He absolutely loves going there because their flour is low in\
  \ gluten so he can eat like a normal human being for a change. There are French\
  \ patisseries everywhere, but let\u2019s just say it\u2019s not exactly cheap. I\
  \ never know how much to budget for food and the easiest way to pay seems to be\
  \ with cash from a bank ATM machine. My first blunder was to get out $8000 francs,\
  \ since this is the equivalent of $100 NZD so probably wouldn\u2019t last longer\
  \ than a few days. The drastic difference in how their currency spends compared\
  \ to dollars takes a bit of getting used to. The first time I bought a coffee it\
  \ was 500 francs and my hand was shaking when I handed it over. Let\u2019s just\
  \ say I ended up going to the ATM 5 times in a 2 week trip, much to my embarrassment.\
  \ My final withdrawal was With 3 days left. I was completely out of cash and my\
  \ credit card wasn\u2019t working. I put my card into the machine and it got stuck.\
  \ No money came out so I stood there for a few seconds starting to panic. The bank\
  \ attached was open so i walked in and approached the teller. She was a stylish\
  \ French women with long red nails like Dracula. I asked her to return my card from\
  \ the ATM. She explain that this process takes 2 weeks because they need to fax\
  \ my bank for permission. The blood surged to my face and i started begging her.\
  \ Without it I couldn\u2019t buy any food for 3 days or get to the airport. As I\
  \ told her how desperate I was feeling she nodded and disappeared for a few minutes,\
  \ returning with her Manager. He was tall and dark and smelled amazing. He said\
  \ \u201CNina\u201D has explained your position and I have decided providing there\
  \ are no error codes we can return your card\u201D. I held my breath until he emerged\
  \ holding my battered card. I still needed cash out so I asked him to supervise\
  \ while I used the in store machine. He seemed slightly amused, but hovered while\
  \ I proceeded. Just as it was returning my card I pulled on it, but I resisted.\
  \ I yelled \u201Chelp help\u201D and he quickly snatched my card with his swift\
  \ fingers and handed it to me like a used tissue. \u201CYour card is old\u201D he\
  \ said. \u201C no your machine is broken\u201D I replied. My caught each other\u2019\
  s gaze and burst out laughing them thanked each other and I left. I felt this elation,\
  \ finally I understood French culture."
