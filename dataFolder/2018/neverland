Text: "Santa Barbara, Sao Miguel, Azores. It\u2019s November and I\u2019m finally\
  \ wet. Clouds pass fast over us in the dutiful rush of bringing rain somewhere far.\
  \ The veil of the water surface is pinched by random showers. Today waves are huge.\
  \ My two fellows and me, we\u2019re right in the place we wanted to be when this\
  \ trip was just an idea: in the Atlantic Ocean, in the middle of a swell, about\
  \ this island that you don\u2019t even notice if you give just a glimpse at the\
  \ map. Neverland.\nA double pull down has welcomed me on this line up. Now I\u2019\
  m not surfing, I\u2019m freaked out and I\u2019m damning the moment I decided to\
  \ paddle out. Under the choking shadow of white foamy water, my mind silently ping-ponged\
  \ to the poignant conclusion that exiting from the water could have been a solution.\n\
  I rumble back to the sweet wet air on my skin the day I arrived. Continental Europe\
  \ wasn\u2019t that warm yet. Before this storm the island was mild and sunny, colors\
  \ exploded all over. Nature had the palette of Italy close to the sea, of Ireland\
  \ a little higher and of Canada on the highest inside parts. Our lay days where\
  \ occupied on art practices and eating the small juicy local pineapples. Now I look\
  \ around on the wild grass behind the beach for a tone of green of those I saw till\
  \ yesterday, but even colors seem to be more serious.\nI turn to the horizon. Was\
  \ it a fin? A shark? Nope, just a deception of sight caused by all those stories\
  \ heard at the bar in Ponta Delgada. Men forgot these islands enough for sea life\
  \ to remember it. The wales like those we saw yesterday from the Miraduro de Santa\
  \ Iria made this a stop on their precious route. Fishes are not shy, they\u2019\
  re at home.\nI hear yelling: it's my mate coming on the line up. He surfed the wave\
  \ that shaked me. Local surfers are obsequious priests, who gave us polite hospitality\
  \ in this temple. We are alone but we hallow ourselves for some loud cheerful joke,\
  \ than we come back to worship the place as locals would. \nThe green and blue water\
  \ of the lakes of Sete Cidades is contrasting with the stormy dark water of the\
  \ sea. We met an old man there yesterday and he is contrasting with me now. \u201C\
  A ilha mais bonita\u201D it\u2019s the only part of the speech I got for sure, but\
  \ you don't have to speak a language to see a man in love. Stop overthinking.\n\
  A set is approaching, I snap flat and paddle. I\u2019m too on the inside, I hope\
  \ I make it! One more stroke and I slide squatting on a trembling board blowing\
  \ across the wall of the wave. Now I'm living Azores!"
