Text: "It had been a few of years since my partner Alex and I first hiked through\
  \ some typically Scottish weather up the UK's highest Mountain, Ben Nevis, so once\
  \ we heard that New Zealand has a Ben Nevis too, we couldn\u2019t resist.\nWe had\
  \ arrived at the top of the North Island, bought a van, called it Earny, and travelled\
  \ in it to the bottom of the South Island, enjoying many of New Zealand\u2019s fantastically\
  \ accessible Great Walks on our way. The routes are well maintained, sign posted,\
  \ and boast a series of ranger-run huts. After we completed the extremely steep\
  \ first section of the Kepler track in a fraction of the recommended time, we felt\
  \ ready to take on a bigger challenge.\nEnter Ben Nevis. At 2,234m high, it makes\
  \ its 1,345m Scottish counter part look tiny. Starting at Lake Wakatipu with beautiful\
  \ weather and boundless excitement, the first section was a picturesque uphill slog\
  \ along a 4WD track with views over the lake below and mountain range beyond. It\
  \ was once we left the track, navigating over rough terrain that the challenge really\
  \ began.\nIn so many ways, New Zealand\u2019s South Island is like the Scottish\
  \ Highlands; its mountains and unending wilderness, not to mention the Scottish\
  \ names which followed its earlier settlers over. Where they differed for me started\
  \ with the natural vegetation; it just seemed so much wilder. Tall sharp grass,\
  \ concealing rocks below, made the going slow and arduous. It took a lot longer\
  \ than expected, so we were pleased to spend a night in the little stone hut en\
  \ route.\nThe next day we continued on to Ben Nevis\u2019 summit. The altitude and\
  \ drop in temperature saw the recession of plant life which was replaced with scree\
  \ slopes and rock scrambles. By that point, our trek was not only a physical challenge\
  \ but a mental one as we willed ourselves onwards. Finally, the summit was in sight;\
  \ we had made it. The views were breathtaking; pools of blue water and great waterfalls\
  \ smashing down on the rocks below, and jagged mountains that seemed to stretch\
  \ on forever. What struck me was how fortunate we were to lay eyes on a view like\
  \ that; a view that few would lay eyes on in their lifetimes.\nWhen we got back\
  \ to Earny (after an unsuccessful short cut which had us following sheep trails,\
  \ crawling under prickle bushes and fighting our way through bracken), I couldn\u2019\
  t help but feel humbled by our experience in the mountains. Once again, travelling\
  \ had reminded me of how incredible the world is if we just make the effort to explore\
  \ it."
