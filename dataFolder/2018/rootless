Text: "Rootless\n\nA ticket office, a tiny area with a light pink sink and two backless\
  \ wooden benches was all the railway station had. The only way to get there was\
  \ through an old road, assymetrical due to the patches made by the asphalt layers.\
  \ There were few people in the station. A sleepy old man on a bench and a woman\
  \ in the queue, holding a child in her arms. I wondered what might their destinations\
  \ be. \n- Good evening.\nI looked absent-mindedly to the end of the railway line.\
  \ The sun was stretching, between yawns, like a flame saying goodbye to the earth.\
  \ \n- Where are you heading?\nThe clouds were reaching the sun, like a cat and mouse\
  \ game, while it melted over the mountains.\n- Hey!\nSomething interrupted the atmosphere\
  \ I created. I turned my head to the right, just enough to realize it was someone.\
  \ A head, behind the ticket office window - that has always seemed to isolate the\
  \ wanderer from the still - was staring at me. Long white beard and wise blue eyes,\
  \ I could swear I had just met W. Whitman. Airheaded, I took off my earphones, reached\
  \ the reception desk and felt the layer of dust that was covering it. \n- Yes? \u2013\
  \ I asked, bending down to a lower position towards the speak hole. That let me\
  \ glance through the dusty window and get the impression that he was living there.\n\
  - Where are you heading? \u2013 the man asked again.\n- To the further destination,\
  \ please. - I improvised.\n- I see. Return ticket? \n- I have no plans of getting\
  \ back. - I did not mean to say it out loud.\n- I see you belong to the one\u2019\
  s who travel aimlessly. But remember: some trees grow so high they might think they\
  \ can fly. But they\u2019ve got roots.\n- So... how do you know when to stop? -\
  \ I asked, unconsciously.\n- You feel roots growing inside of your chest - he said,\
  \ giving me a ticket - we already have seeds. Some need more water, some less.\n\
  - Maybe I\u2019m seedless.\nI looked again to that reddish disk-shaped sun, free-falling\
  \ to the ground, defying gravity. Where would it fall? \n- I hope this is enough.\
  \ - I gave him all the money I had and then checked the station clock. \n- That\u2019\
  s your train. - he said.\nAs soon as the orange sky turned into a bluish cloak,\
  \ I took the train and sank in one of the seats. There was a subtil lavanda smell\
  \ in the air. I was expected to travel 11 hours, so I leaned my head in the window\
  \ and closed my eyes. The light was almost vanished, every color less saturated\
  \ and I felt unbounded. It was cold, but my heart couldn\u2019t be warmer. Time\
  \ was endless, and so I felt myself."
