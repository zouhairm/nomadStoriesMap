Text: "In the past couple of months that I have spent traveling, there have been more\
  \ than few unexpected experiences. Perhaps the most unexpected, was when a series\
  \ of events unfolded and I found myself to uttering \u2018those\u2019 three words.\
  \ The day was identical to those leading up to it, my friends and I had spent every\
  \ daylight hour on the road, driving our trusty auto-rickshaw from Jaisalmer, Rajasthan\
  \ to Kochi, Kerala. It was late on the penultimate day of the Rickshaw Run (look\
  \ it up, then do it) and we had thought it best to find a place to stay somewhere\
  \ in the North of Kerala, then make the final kilometres early the next day. Road\
  \ weary, we decided to head to the beach for sunset and some spiritual recuperation.\
  \ My overriding memory of this drive was the smell while heading through the fishing\
  \ port. It smelt, well, exactly like you can imagine an Indian fishing port smelling.\
  \ I won\u2019t elaborate, but if you truly desire to know, I suggest you go to the\
  \ fishmonger, buy ALL of his/her fish, and leave them in sun all day. When we arrived\
  \ at the beach the sunset was spectacular. The sun was just about to touch the water;\
  \ the beach faced directly west and when standing at the water\u2019s edge all that\
  \ could be seen was sun, sea, and sky. This was also the ideal place to stand to\
  \ avoid glimpsing at the rubbish littered beach, which not so romantic. As we gazed\
  \ at the setting sun, a group of children ran over and, with rather a substantial\
  \ amount of force, dragged us over to a large gathering of people. They were drinking\
  \ and dancing to fifteen or so drummers. The atmosphere was crazy, it felt like\
  \ I was at a festival, surrounded by people on ecstasy. We partied for less than\
  \ an hour, but the intensity was exhausting. I turned to Joe and he nodded that\
  \ was probably time we head back to tranquillity of our hotel room. As we turned\
  \ to leave, we enquired to the nearest person what the celebration was in aid of.\
  \ A man, wearing a towel on his head and aviator sunglasses, looked shocked that\
  \ we didn\u2019t already know; he exclaimed \u201Cwe celebrate 40 years red politics\
  \ in Kerala!\u201D. It was only then, with our newly altered perception that we\
  \ recognised the murals of Lenin, Stalin, and Castro on nearby walls, the intricate\
  \ Soviet d\xE9cor on the drums and drummers, and a vast abundance of red. Walking\
  \ away I turned to Harri and Joe, looking them both in the eyes, I got to utter\
  \ those three words. \u201CCommunist. Beach. Party.\u201D I know, I can\u2019t believe\
  \ it either."
