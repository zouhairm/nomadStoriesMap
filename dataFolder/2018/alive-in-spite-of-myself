Text: "Invincibility is an affliction that targets the wrong demographic. Adults,\
  \ who have spouses, children, and creaky knees, have been made aware of their own\
  \ mortality, but youths have been blissfully spared, allowed to spend their days\
  \ assured that yeah, everyone dies, but if anyone were to defy death itself, surely\
  \ it would be them.\nIt\u2019s that overconfidence that compelled me to rent a scooter\
  \ in Ninh Binh, Vietnam, with my only prior experience ending in a narrowly avoided\
  \ collision in the mountains of Thailand. Of course, having thwarted the Grim Reaper\
  \ once, I knew he wouldn\u2019t try again.\nNinh Binh looks incredibly similar to\
  \ Ha Long Bay on marshland, if you were to purge the bay of its party boats and\
  \ faint sounds of Pitbull keeping you company through the night. Kong: Skull Island\
  \ was filmed there and after seeing the jagged edges of the karsts, mostly covered\
  \ in vegetation with the limestone face occasionally peeking out, as though a gigantic\
  \ ape had uprooted that area, it\u2019s clear to see why. If you go during a rainy\
  \ or foggy day as I did, you will be greeted with an even more ominous landscape.\n\
  You will also be greeted with slippery roads. I see a car on one and pull over to\
  \ let them pass. With no space to plant my feet and stop, I pulse on the throttle\
  \ to stay upright in the loose, wet gravel. Just as they clear me, I feel the bike\
  \ tilting and attempt to rebalance, but in the process I grip the throttle and turn\
  \ it all the way. My scooter transformed into a missile \u2013 one that I had gotten\
  \ off of without injury, but not before launching it directly into a rice paddy.\n\
  I\u2019m standing on the side of the road with no working phone, trying to decide\
  \ if I leave the moped to walk back or wait. After a minute, the decision is made\
  \ for me as a taxi drives by. I stop him and invite him to help retrieve my scooter\
  \ from the grips of the paddy, which he enthusiastically denies before alerting\
  \ the hostel. I wait five minutes for them to arrive and go through my Rolodex of\
  \ Vietnamese mechanics and attorneys. I sit in silence for the remaining 4:55; my\
  \ Rolodex proves to be remarkably short. Four men from the hostel find me and together\
  \ we hoist the bike back on dry land. After a few seconds, one gets it to work and\
  \ rides back, while I fall behind and walk. I get back to a staff who, between politely\
  \ suppressed laughs, insist on washing my clothes, and bring me a towel and a Band-Aid\
  \ before asking if I\u2019m alright.\n\u201CAlright? I\u2019m great! Turns out,\
  \ I\u2019m invincible.\u201D"
