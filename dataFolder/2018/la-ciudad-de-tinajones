Text: "53 years since anyone in my family had set foot on the island of Cuba, and\
  \ here I am. A six hours drive to the eastern city of Camaguey, the birth city of\
  \ our mother. 274 Calle 3, El Jardin was the inaccurate address my sister and I\
  \ used to scour the old, colonial city, its circular roads extending out like ripples\
  \ on water. Our feet churn up dust as we move from one Camagueyano to the next;\
  \ a man who has to plug the hole in his smoker's neck tells us he has never heard\
  \ of our family name but points us in the direction of someone who might. It was\
  \ in his home, street dogs wandering in and out of the open door, where he confirms\
  \ the hospital close to our mother's old home is on the other side of the city.\
  \ With the challenge of the setting sun, we find anyone with as many wrinkles as\
  \ our Cuban abuela--only they will remember our family. It's this way that we meet\
  \ Luz Maria, a feisty, retired history teacher, and her brother Calixto, a revolutionary\
  \ whom serenades us with Argentine ballads. His wife brings us sweet espressos and\
  \ cookies, eyes lighting up with the details of our story: we're just trying to\
  \ find any traces of our family. She confirms another landmark and practically pushes\
  \ us out the door! At the end of the street, I spot a woman with white hair standing\
  \ in her doorway, but she's only been living in the house for 18 years--not enough\
  \ to remember. My sister halfheartedly recites our story to her, and she recognizes\
  \ the name, but to speak to the older couple down the path. We fly down it and it\
  \ takes everything in me not to pound on the door the way my heart pounds in my\
  \ chest. A small, elderly woman shuffles out with an innocent smile. My sister addresses\
  \ her gently, but she admits her memory isn't very good and calls her husband. He\
  \ emerges shirtless in khakis, gray hairs at his temples. My Spanish shakes but\
  \ he smiles at the mention of our abuelo's name, the crows feet sprouting around\
  \ his eyes.\n\"Antonio Vassallo? Of course I know him, this was once his home.\"\
  \ He gestures inside and my sister and I look at each, shocked, but follow him in.\
  \ They share memories of our grandparents, of our mother and her siblings. We confirm\
  \ that our abuelo passed away 20 years ago and his cheeks seem to hollow. \n\"I\
  \ didn't know if I'd hear from him again, but I didn't expect it to be in this form,\"\
  \ his gaze traveling from my sister to settle on me. \"Tell your mother that we'll\
  \ be waiting here for her when she arrives.\"\nI nod, a laugh escaping my lips."
