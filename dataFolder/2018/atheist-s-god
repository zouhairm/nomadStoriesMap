Text: "First day in this new country.As I was waiting at the local bus stop beside\
  \ the petrol pump, I stood fascinated with the surreal visuals.The highway was covered\
  \ with autumn leaves while the\_cool morning breeze kissed my cheek.Just as I realized\
  \ that not a single bus had stopped for the time I\u2019d been waiting there, I\
  \ decided to check with the man working at the petrol pump.\n\nI walked up to him\
  \ with my baffled face, an aged man greeted me with his wrinkled mellow smile. Considering\
  \ that this locality is far from town, I hesitantly asked him - Aujhisi(Uncle) English!\n\
  Crisscrossing his hands, he smiled & said- Aniyo (No).\n\nIt was a test of my sign\
  \ language skills.The combination of my exaggerated face expression & monkey hand\
  \ gestures as if he is unable to hear me, along with few words like Beomeosa Temple,\
  \ bus, bus stop & that's it.I presume he also had the similar assumption for me\
  \ but with his enthusiastic upright tiny body, he successfully explained me the\
  \ bus route to the nearest bus depot from where I could get a direct bus to Beomeosa\
  \ Temple.\n\nFinally, I stepped in the bus.While settling down at my window seat\
  \ I realized that Beomeosa Temple was the first place I\u2019d canceled from my\
  \ \"to do\" list in Busan trip.Somehow\_the idea of visiting a temple like a tourist\
  \ didn\u2019t fascinate me as a newly born traveler.My parents took me to the temple\
  \ almost every week in India & this one is too far from the city.\nIf only I had\
  \ learned the metro system correctly I could have made up at la la land filled with\
  \ the fellow traveler.But, it was ok I had stepped on the metro for the first time\
  \ ever.\n\nThe bus dropped me at the destination.I followed the route as explained\
  \ by the Ajhusi but when I took the left, as he\u2019d mentioned, I found myself\
  \ in the middle of a street with no existence of bus depot. There was a fat old\
  \ man busy dusting racks of his small grocery store.I went up to him & greeted-\
  \ Aneyong Ajhusi (Hello uncle) then started my signs, magic words, virtual car driving\
  \ skills etc. to ask him about the bus depot.His puzzled & uninterested look explained\
  \ to me that he has better things to do in life.\n\nI turned around & saw the blossomed\
  \ civilization but not a single human.Looking at the silent empty road I realized\
  \ the busyness of society.I looked up at the Sun on duty & before I could blink\
  \ my eye I saw a Man at some distance.Suddenly for an atheist, he turned into the\
  \ God with illuminating divine rays.There he was, the petrol pump \u201CAujhisi\u201D\
  \ with the mellow smile."
