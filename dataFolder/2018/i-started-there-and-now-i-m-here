Text: "Looking across the staggeringly steep cliffs hugging the rolling green hills\
  \ along the Cantabrian Sea, miles in the distance, I see them. White windmills.\
  \ Magnificent. Graceful. Moving with the changes of the wind while prevailing unwaveringly.\
  \ \nThe sweat continues to infiltrate through my backpack as I let myself take a\
  \ deep breath. \n\u201CI started there. And now, I\u2019m here.\u201D\nMy gaze embraces\
  \ the sea, taking comfort in the rhythm of the waves and the infinite shades of\
  \ blue. As my glance drops down to the hearty earth, it is interrupted by the tattered\
  \ braces covering my knees, which equally wobble and throb with pain. I catch myself\
  \ kindly caressing them. For once, thanking them for their persistence and dedication,\
  \ rather than cursing them for their weakness and pain. \n\u201CI started there.\
  \ And now, I\u2019m here.\u201D\nThis time breathing in the lush late spring air,\
  \ tears start forming in my eyes. I quickly realize that it\u2019s not only the\
  \ physical journey overwhelming me - it\u2019s my personal one, my growth.\nI see\
  \ the kid who was left to play with herself on the playground, the kid picked last\
  \ for the dodgeball team, the kid laughed at by gym teachers. I saw a girl who lived\
  \ in books, who suffered severe panic attacks, who never felt worthy.  \nFor the\
  \ first time in my life, I am unrecognizable to my former self.  \nI initially moved\
  \ abroad and started solo traveling due to a desire to leap outside of my comfort\
  \ zone, beyond the incredible safety net of my family and friends. Fairly quickly,\
  \ I realized how supported I still felt, how surprisingly gracefully I had landed\
  \ on my feet. It was time to raise the stakes. \nSo I decided to tackle my biggest\
  \ vulnerability: my body. Having been born with torqued femurs, anything involving\
  \ physicality left me feeling in pain and ashamed. However, I decided it was time\
  \ I finally took control. I needed to prove to myself that I was capable of not\
  \ only moving mountains, but climbing them. That is how I found myself forging over\
  \ the footsteps that had been trodden for centuries before me on the Camino de Santiago\
  \ del Norte. \nAs I embrace the unclear path before me, it hits me. Every step I\u2019\
  ve taken, all of the falls and bruises, all of the victories and celebrations, have\
  \ led me to this exact moment. This is exactly where I am supposed to be. \nPutting\
  \ one-mud stained hiking boot in front of the next, I plow forward, knowing that\
  \ later I will be able to look back at this unique, ethereal patch and think, \u201C\
  I started there. And now, I\u2019m here.\u201D"
