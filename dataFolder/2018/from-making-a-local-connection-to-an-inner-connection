Text: "\u201CSo, Gloria, what did you learn today?\u201D said Fernando, laughing as\
  \ I tried - and failed- to eat rice using chopsticks. \u201CNothing!\u201D I answered,\
  \ with my hair full of food and my mouth empty. In that moment, I looked around\
  \ to our small group of friends, who had met just a few days before, and felt a\
  \ lasting bond being formed, despite our different origins.\nIndeed, one special\
  \ aspect of Singapore that caught my eye from the beginning was its multiculturality.\
  \ As one of the biggest cities in Asia, it symbolized a world of discoveries to\
  \ me: from the architectural style to the language and traditions, everything seemed\
  \ new and exciting.\nBy the time I got out of the airport, I remember to admire\
  \ the fact that in a neighborhood next to a huge Mosque, with its imposing yet classic\
  \ look, stood a Hindu Temple, full of colors and shapes. And that, by the end of\
  \ the street, there was a McDonald\u2019s. \nBut the skyscrapers, monuments, and\
  \ temples were only a reflection of its residents. I can say that the most impressive\
  \ part of my trip there was acknowledging the peaceful way in which this melting\
  \ pot arranged itself. Although Rio de Janeiro, my hometown, has the reputation\
  \ of being a welcoming, cosmopolitan place, it is hard to spot true diversity. On\
  \ the other hand, the Singaporean community as a whole seemed to fully accept the\
  \ variety of ethnicities. And I was instantly consumed by such harmonical scenery.\n\
  Within time, I started to recognize the city\u2019s eclectic essence in each one\
  \ of the faces of my new buddies. I often saw it when Rodger attempted to teach\
  \ me how to pronounce his name in the south African accent. Or when Fernando sang\
  \ Brazilian songs to show me how Portuguese was similar to his mother tongue Spanish\
  \ (it isn\u2019t). Or when Shayan, from Pakistan, and Purvi, from India, sat side\
  \ by side talking amicably, despite their countries\u2019 rivalry. But I always\
  \ saw it whenever we were all together, either laughing at my lack of coordination\
  \ with chopsticks or sharing our best trip memories at night.\nFinally, I began\
  \ to notice that same gist in my own face. The contact with all of them made me\
  \ progressively outgrown myself. I became more mature, independent and open-minded\
  \ than ever before. And through that new pair of fresh eyes, I\u2019ve been able\
  \ to see further into myself. I am proud to state now that more than making \u201C\
  local connections\u201D, I have made an inner connection that has changed me forever."
