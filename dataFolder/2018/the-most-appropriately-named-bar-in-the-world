Text: "As I left Charlotte, on our first date in Xi'an, China, to visit the men's\
  \ room, the last thing I expected was to come back to our table moments later and\
  \ explain how I had just been given a surprise shoulder massage by the bathroom\
  \ attendant while using the urinal.\n\nTroublingly, what happened in that bathroom\
  \ at the Half-Past Eight Friendship Changing Club may not have been the most surprising\
  \ part of a night that led to an intercontinental romance.\n\nCharlotte and I had\
  \ met a few days earlier on a plane from Beijing to Xi'an, and the Brit and the\
  \ Canadian worked out a date.\n\nOur agenda wasn't rigid, and our first stop was\
  \ a boring but unsafe choice: food. We ate at a table on the sidewalk, sharing vegetable\
  \ dishes and meat skewers. Little did I know why the meat was so spicy or why they\
  \ only charged us for what we ate.\n\nPost-dinner drinks weren't supposed to be\
  \ eventful either. But you don't pass by the Half-Past Eight Friendship Changing\
  \ Club. You take the long staircase underground.\n\nThe phones on the tables and\
  \ the numbers on the ceiling were a departure from Western norms. We quickly understood\
  \ that it gave people uncomfortable with approaching strangers the ability to reach\
  \ out from afar. Smart. We decided to stick around for an after-dinner bar romance\
  \ show.\n\nAnd that's when it happened. With no expectation of the consequences,\
  \ I passed the bathroom attendant, as I had seen bathroom attendant's before. Of\
  \ course, my Chinese guidebook didn't translate 'can you stop massaging me, I'm\
  \ trying to pee'. But it would have helped.\n\nWe left the bar. And walked straight\
  \ into a world of continuing oddities.\n\nThe frogs crushing each other to death\
  \ into street vendors tanks was unappealing. The two men - one swinging the snake\
  \ to keep its head away from him while the other held a shopping bag to catch it\
  \ - was concerning. The little girl who gave Charlotte a flower, extorted me for\
  \ 87 cents, then ran away with both flower and money, was comical and criminal.\
  \ \n\nCharlotte and I continued the date with conversation in her room. Unfortunately,\
  \ we figured out the reason for the spicy meat and confusing bill; we had leftovers\
  \ from previous diners.\n\nThe last thing I expected was to be in the hotel of a\
  \ posh blond lady from London, on our first date, in China, with diarrhea. For the\
  \ bathroom walls to be so thin that she could hear me laughing at the ridiculousness\
  \ of it. And for that to be the start of a romance that included international travel\
  \ and living together."
