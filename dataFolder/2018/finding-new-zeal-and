Text: "Many stories begin with the sounds of things: the clacking of cicadas through\
  \ twisting vines in a dense tropical forest as you climb towards the crescendo of\
  \ a misty waterfall. Even the sounds in the names of places beckons the intrigue\
  \ of origin.  One such name has long tickled my ears with the intrigue of a fresh,\
  \ vibrant, rugged island surrounded by ocean at the end of the world: New Zealand.\
  \ Despite its somewhat erroneous misnomer by Abel Tasman in 1642, New Zealand rings\
  \ of a place to discover new zeal for life: a fresh perspective, rejuvenation for\
  \ the soul, zest, & exploration of lands, creatures, & legend.  Besides its reputation\
  \ for wild beauty + cultural richness of native Maori people who\u2019s folklore\
  \ weaves together harmonious stories of land & sea, New Zealand\u2014for me\u2014\
  represents a place of hope in starting over and embracing life. After choosing to\
  \ leave a steady career path, go back to school for a master\u2019s degree far beyond\
  \ my comfort zone, and create new dreams, I struggled to cope with a deeply personal\
  \ sense of failure as I felt employers, community, and family members often wanted\
  \ me to be different than I was. Trying & failing in big ways I started 2 new jobs\
  \ resulting in terminations within a year, struged with the grief of losing my beloved\
  \ grandmother to Alzheimer\u2019s & above all, the discouragement or realizing that\
  \ the life goals I\u2019d tried to achieve, despite my best efforts, sacrifices,\
  \ and work, would likely not happen in the way I hoped, if at all. Discouraged,\
  \ broken, & overwhelmed at the prospect of starting what felt like another battle,\
  \ I found myself at a critical junction with the choice to give up to the pain or\
  \ to find space for the healing, love, & hope I needed, looking at the many reasons\u2014\
  beyond goals\u2014for being alive & celebrating the opportunities I DO have. New\
  \ Zealand was that space as I asserted my freedom to take a month-long first-time\
  \ solo trip into Aotearoa, the land of the long white cloud, finding my \u201Cnew\
  \ zeal\u201D & learning to love who I am as I find a path forward. Like the roads\
  \ carved into the stunning landscapes flanked by mountains, glaciers, rainforests,\
  \ & seascapes I explored, the oceanic island, half a world away from home reminded\
  \ me that there is so much beauty in the diversity, the challenges, & even the volatility\
  \ of life.  Listening to the hum of a ferry engine in the gentle breeze of crossing\
  \ Cooks Straight, I\u2019m hopeful on my journey home, heart full, and head clear."
