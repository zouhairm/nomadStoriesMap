Text: "Compass, knife, snake-proof boots (I had been bitten in a previous trip, so\
  \ I insisted), and my favorite socks checked off my list, I felt adequately prepared\
  \ for whatever adventure. The details of our trip were never made explicit to me,\
  \ as dawn had not yet risen, and the groggy morning air abated any unnecessary talk.\
  \ Once packed, my father and I drove over the Maracaibo bridge toward the airport.\
  \ We boarded a small plane, and I, being a sleepy youth, fell asleep. I woke when\
  \ we landed in a small, humble port town on the south edge of the Orinoco River.\n\
  \nA man named Fernando met us near the edge of the port. He helped us load our equipment\
  \ into a small river boat, but it wasn\u2019t until we were loaded up that I decided\
  \ to ask what our destination was. With a slight grin on my father\u2019s face,\
  \ which I read as a mask for his own hesitation of the unknown, we made for the\
  \ headwaters. I took to fishing to entertain myself while they shared some beers\
  \ and conversed about photography and conservation efforts. By the time I tired,\
  \ two large ice chests had been filled with fish.\n\nClose to dusk, we reached our\
  \ destination. We anchored when we spotted some nearby fires. A whole small village\
  \ of Yanomami came out to greet us. As Fernando spoke their language with some proficiency,\
  \ he made it clear we were not affiliated with any church, and that we had brought\
  \ a fair helping of fish to share.\n\nOur Hosts smoked the fish using banana leaves,\
  \ a technique I thought seemed homey. Night set in, and the elders of the small\
  \ village divvied the fish on banana leaves as some of the women allotted rations\
  \ of cassava and fruit. The headmen of the village talked to my father and Fernando\
  \ about the activities of the coming day, and I would interrupt to enthusiastically\
  \ tell everyone about my net fishing technique. One of the headmen, Fernando told\
  \ me, complimented my prowess as a fisherman, and said that I had the spirit of\
  \ a great tuxawa, which means something akin to \u201Ca leader who can settle arguments\u201D\
  . Fernando was kind enough to indulge my fervent discourse with the elders, and\
  \ that night, we were treated better than kings; we were treated like family.\n\n\
  Tired after a full day of adventure, I retired to my hammock. When my father came\
  \ to check on me, I asked him if we had enough fuel to get back to the port. His\
  \ reply came after a few seconds, but he stated that the greatest advantage of traveling\
  \ against the current is the assurance that one can always ride the current back."
