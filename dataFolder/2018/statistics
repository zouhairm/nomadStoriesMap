Text: "My eyes opened slowly, unclear if the haziness came from the myopia or from\
  \ the tiredness of the last 48 hours. I looked at the people in the car and I got\
  \ a paradoxical feeling: I loved and hated them at the same time; I guess this is\
  \ the natural reaction to being copped up for too long in a moving car with your\
  \ dear ones. \nThe first things I saw were the tall, grey block of flats on the\
  \ outskirts of the city that reminded me so well of the Communist architecture I\
  \ knew by heart. \u201CAre you kidding me?\u201D I thought out loud. \u201CThis\
  \ is the oh-so-cool city everybody\u2019s fussing about?\u201D My people didn\u2019\
  t say anything; they ignored my rant, the one that still haunts me. How I could\u2019\
  ve been so wrong, how I could\u2019ve run my mouth off, me, the person who is so\
  \ composed and so mindful of her behavior? We passed endless neighborhoods of grey\
  \ block of flats; we caught glimpses of yellow trams going up and down the many\
  \ over ground bridges in the city and we became increasingly careful of the avalanche\
  \ of urban cyclists that passed smoothly next to the car. We reached our second\
  \ destination of a long holiday on a late Friday evening in early September, a torrid\
  \ evening in a suffocated city that welcomed us with its streets filled with drunken,\
  \ albeit happy people.\nThat night we searched for a place to eat, elbowing our\
  \ way through the crowds of hipster festival goers, incessant street hustlers that\
  \ were trying to sell us all the feel-good stuff they had on them, struggling street\
  \ artists and rampant teenagers, enjoying their newly found freedom. We didn\u2019\
  t find anything more than a combination of a Turkish fast-food and a supermarket\
  \ with two long benches that seemed harder to get a place at than it was to find\
  \ a place to park. This was the tipping point of a miserable first day in Berlin,\
  \ the city I now love the most. \nWe spent the next few days running around the\
  \ city, being classic tourists and trying to tick off as many things on the list\
  \ as we could. This was my first time traveling abroad, so I had to see it all,\
  \ feel it all, taking it all in. And somehow, without even noticing, the first evening\
  \ seemed unreal, like something that happened in another life. I couldn\u2019t have\
  \ thought so many ill things about the city that, without anything special, mesmerized\
  \ me and left me unable to explain to people, to my people, why I\u2019ve fallen\
  \ so hard for it. \nAfter 3 years, 20 countries and over 50 cities visited in the\
  \ meanwhile, I still can\u2019t believe the mark Berlin has left on me."
