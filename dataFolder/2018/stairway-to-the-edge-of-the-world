Text: "If you've heard of the Stairway to Heaven in Oahu, Hawaii, you know it's a\
  \ hike with just under 4,000 steps. And is illegal. \n\nAs you ascend the Koolau\
  \ mountain range and make your way up to the Puu Keahiakahoe summit, you experience\
  \ some of the most breathtaking landscapes one could ever have the pleasure of witnessing.\
  \ Keep in mind that at this point, you are probably drenched in mud, quivering,\
  \ sore, cold, sweaty, maybe wind burned, and your hair is flying in every direction.\
  \ Now you may be wondering, is the view worth it?\n\nI began the hike early in the\
  \ morning, weaving my way through the jungle. After a wrong turn, scaling a waterfall\
  \ unexpectedly, slipping in mud, I emerged into a bamboo forest that lead to the\
  \ first steps to Heaven. \n\nHere, the security guard waits for you at the entrance.\
  \ My adrenaline kicked in; anxious thoughts raced through my head as fast as my\
  \ heart was beating.  I hesitated, considering turning back. What if I got caught?\
  \ What if I have to pay a minimum $600 fine? What if my knee gives out halfway through\
  \ the hike? What if I don't reach the summit?\n\n\"Alex, you'll regret it if you\
  \ don't try.\" \n\nThese words pushed me to the edge. Of the world.\n\nMy friend\
  \ is an extremely outgoing individual, and just as adventurous as I am. Except she\
  \ doesn't have patellofemoral pain syndrome. She didn't know the pain worsens when\
  \ climbing stairs. And here I am at the bottom of the Haiku stairs. Being there,\
  \ I wasn't sure it was worth the burning sensation I might experience in my knee.\
  \ Obviously, I yearned to complete this hike, an item at the top of my bucket list\
  \ for years. But 4,000 steps for someone with patellofemoral syndrome, and on top\
  \ of that, a risk of having to evade a cop? As stubborn as my friend is, I am extremely\
  \ grateful she convinced me to continue on. We made the trek all the way there,\
  \ why turn back now? So I trudged on and was blessed with the outcome. All around\
  \ me, the world was full of color and life. It was enough to distract me and make\
  \ me crave to rise to the top of the mountain. I finally reached the summit, and\
  \ my body was exhausted. Yet, I had never felt so alive. I had just conquered a\
  \ physically enduring task with an injury. I was feeding off of the energy from\
  \ the fellow champions atop the mountain, the forceful wind swirling around my face,\
  \ and the misty fog clearing to reveal the island beneath me. Suddenly, I understood\
  \ where the hike got its name. The entry to heaven was right here: the edge of the\
  \ world."
