Text: As the day was finally came after 4 long months it was April 6 2017 when I started
  my trip to Rajasthan with one of my old school friend. As after my collage internship
  I was totally exhausted because it 4 months long internship. Then I decided to go
  somewhere where I can find myself , I can relax and I can relive the moment of life.
  So we went to trip to with my friend on a bike of 125cc on 7 days long trip for
  about 2500 km to cover almost whole Rajasthan like Jaipur, Ajmer, Pushkar, Jodhpur,
  Udaipur, Mount Abu, Bhangarh etc. As we left on 6th of April of night I picked up
  my friend from his home then we started the journey we took halt to relax. On the
  next  day we reached Jaipur, we explored local Jaipur market and some fort we had
  the breakfast at McDonald's then in the evening time we left for the Ajmer in the
  late night we reached to Ajmer then we rented the hotel then we got fresh then we
  kept our luggage then we came outside of the hotel we started searching for something
  to eat but there was nothing opened in that night luckily we found one small hotel
  is opened but food was not we just ate little bit then we paid and left on next
  morning we explored Ajmer and we went to Pushkar to see the world's only Brahma
  Temple (Hindu God) then we left to Jodhpur in the morning around 11:00 AM and in
  the evening we reached Jodhpur then we rented the hotel. On the next day we explored
  Jodhpur fort and tried some local cuisine then we left for Mount Abu which is a
  small hill station in Rajasthan then we left for Udaipur and we reached Udaipur
  late in the night we rented the hotel on the next morning we explored whole Udaipur
  the palaces of Udaipur the lakes of Udaipur then we left for our home but it became
  night when we were in Jaipur as we are continuously travelling from last 6 days
  and our too so we both are tired and our bike too then we decided to took a hotel
  rest for over night then on next morning we left for the Bhangarh fort (India's
  Most haunted place) we went into the fort searched the story behind the fort then
  we left for our home after our bike is not getting started we tried alot but it
  doesn't started as fort was situated in the outskirts Alwar so there was no mechanic
  so I was there my own mechanic for my bike then I somehow manage to start my bike
  then I didn't off my bikes engine. In late night I safely reached to home in that
  I got to what can be my limits how long I can sustain how long I can push myself.
