Text: "It was a last-minute decision - a family trip as my parents had just arrived\
  \ from Canada to Europe and  I wanted to take them for a few days to see some sun\
  \ sand and sea .    Looking at the map and our budget we were a bit restricted ,\
  \ then all of a sudden this tiny dot in the Mediterranean came into view on our\
  \ map - Malta.   Having checked the rates from London as well as hotel packages\
  \ we managed to book a flight . With very limited expectations we were still looking\
  \ for to spending time together with the family .  \n We were pleasantly surprised\
  \ with the clean rooms and friendly staff at the hotel as well as our meal options\
  \ at the Corinthia in Malta.  We decided to rent a car and explore the island further.\
  \   The people were  very friendly and welcoming  and the climate , like it\u2019\
  s people were warm and inviting .  we were told it is like this all year round .\
  \  The open top hop on and hop off tour was an excellent choice for our group  as\
  \ we managed to see the sights are on budget  .\n As we had two small children we\
  \ managed to do some shopping for some local arts and crafts as reminders of our\
  \ time spent on this friendly island .  \n As Malta is made up of two islands we\
  \ took the ferry to go across to Gozo which was just a short journey away and also\
  \ a wonderful island to explore. \nNever overcrowded and with lots of history Malta\
  \ proved to be a gem in the Mediterranean. \nIf you do have a small group I would\
  \ definitely recommend renting a vehicle and exploring the island on your own. \
  \ there is no way you can get lost and the locals are more than willing to give\
  \ you directions.  One evening we found a small restaurant which served fresh local\
  \ fish well prepared and as an accompaniment we had the Maltese -speciality of timpana\
  \ a macaroni pie.\n\nFor a light snack though it is a must to have a pastizzi -\
  \ a light filo pastry filled with ricotta cheese or mushy peas .  Enjoy the mouthwater\
  \ goodness of this unique savoury snack while on the island.  A taste to remember.\
  \   \n\nWe had loads of fantastic photo opportunities during our drive and on the\
  \ golden  sand beaches .   The magnificent sunsets are a photographer\u2019s  dream.\n\
  \nI can see why so many people , we later found out, have weddings and honeymoon\
  \ here.  \n\nNeedless to say that the long weekend went by very quickly and we had\
  \ a pleasant family gathering in Malta having enjoyed the beach the weather and\
  \ most of all the people.\n\nWould I do it again definitely."
