Text: "\u201CLet Pachamama in.\u201D \n  Breathe. Pachamama is wet, she is heavy,\
  \ she feels familiar.\n Gabby\u2019s translations harmonize with the Shaman\u2019\
  s voice as he motions to the air, the green stripes of his ceremonial robe mimicking\
  \ the green Andes which frame the scene. Once white perhaps, a brown and wrinkled\
  \ church rests behind the Shaman, his words bouncing against its doors before reaching\
  \ back around us to slip down the hill toward the humble village of Chinchero. With\
  \ traditional attire, the local women of the village surround us, a flock of open\
  \ arms, their dark eyes mirror the dark houses dotting the dirt hill.\n My grandma\
  \ sits next to me, a red shawl draped around her shoulders, a stark contrast against\
  \ her white hair. Further down the line sit my parents and sister. Our eyes follow\
  \ the smoke of an incense stick which the Shaman waves from left to right in front\
  \ of my uncle and soon to be aunt. With our brightly colored rain jackets, pale\
  \ skin, and tennis shoes, we stand out, notoriously American. Would Pachamama, their\
  \ mother Earth, accept this group of outsiders with arms as open as her Andean villagers?\
  \ \n          My stomach growls loudly. Alicia, a local Quechua woman reaches out,\
  \ her calloused fingers rough against my bright red cheeks. She keeps close to me\
  \ for the rest of the ceremony, whispers soft and fast words I can\u2019t understand.\
  \ \n            Confetti explodes, symbolizing happiness in Quechuan culture, the\
  \ couple kisses and our wedding party leaves the church lawn to walk through the\
  \ village of small brown and pink houses to the home of the flute player, Iglesio.\
  \ His pink adobe gate beckons with its festoon of yellow, white, purple, and pink\
  \ flowers, interwoven together with long green vines. Alicia once again takes my\
  \ arm, leading me inside. \n            Once within the walls she motions Gabby\
  \ to our sides, repeating the words she had whispered into my ear moments before.\
  \ A warm smile spreads across her face before she turns to translate, \u201CI can\
  \ hear your stomach growling, and I want to adopt you. You will never be hungryas\
  \ my daughter.\u201D Genuinely moved, my natural awkwardness subsides for a moment\
  \ as I place a hand to my heart and turn back to Alicia.\n            \u201CI believe\
  \ you.\u201D At my words Alicia smiles. She nods her head, waves away any translation.\
  \ Love requires no words in Peru.\nI'm left unable to explain that it\u2019s a new\
  \ hunger that rests within me, a hunger which can be fed only by a different mother;\
  \ Pachamama."
