Text: "\u201CHey Kyle, would you like to come to my village and meet my family?\u201D\
  \n\nI had just arrived in the Balinese city of Ubud when I found myself being asked\
  \ this question by my 17-year-old bartender. Putu was the kind of guy that made\
  \ you drop your guard almost immediately \u2013 or was it the countless shots we\
  \ had shared? Either way...\n\n\u201CYes! I\u2019d love to.\u201D\n\nThe small village\
  \ of Kemenuh was a short drive through lush rainforest. \u201CHere we are,\u201D\
  \ Putu announced, as we pulled up to an ornately-carved gate set into a long stone\
  \ wall. For the rest of the morning, I was fed exotic fruits of every color imaginable,\
  \ while Putu\u2019s little sisters and cousins taught me Balinese words and showed\
  \ me how to play the Rindik, a musical instrument made of bamboo.\n\nLater that\
  \ day Putu\u2019s friend Weednyana stopped by. \u201CYou can call me \u2018Weed\u2019\
  ,\u201D he said. We talked for some time before I mentioned I would soon be heading\
  \ back to Ubud. \u201CWhy don\u2019t you stay?\u201D he asked. \u201CI have room\
  \ in my family\u2019s house and tomorrow night is Kemenuh\u2019s big festival.\u201D\
  \n\nI spent the following day exploring Kemenuh\u2019s temples and watching Weed\u2019\
  s father carving mythical characters from wood that looked like crocodile skin.\
  \ Then Weed\u2019s family dressed me in traditional Balinese headdress, shirt and\
  \ sarong for the festival. \n\nThe night was spectacular and I felt as if in another\
  \ world. The music weaved a spell and I could imagine each dancer shifting into\
  \ dragon, bird, flame. The performance culminated with a dance called the Joged;\
  \ a single dancer glided onto the stage in raiment of luminous gold. I sat entranced\
  \ by her as she floated to the edge of the crowd. I lurched back to reality as I\
  \ realized she was scanning the sea of faces and beckoning on-lookers to join her\
  \ onstage in a sort of one-on-one dance duel. Two brave souls were vanquished before\
  \ I saw Weed waving me up from his place near the stage. My palms were sweating\
  \ profusely and I began contemplating my escape from the building. Then I thought\
  \ of how unlikely it was that I should be in this foreign land with such an opportunity\
  \ before me. I had to do this. My heart was racing as I stood, made my way through\
  \ the throng of people toward the stage, and danced the Joged.\n\nAs I said my goodbyes\
  \ and left Kemenuh behind, I was overwhelmed by emotion. Only a few days before,\
  \ I was unaware of the existence of Kemenuh. Now, because of the kindness and hospitality\
  \ they had shown me, I had a whole village of new friends."
