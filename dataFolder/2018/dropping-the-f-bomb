Text: "Dropping the F-bomb\n\nImagine dropping the F-bomb to a TV production crew\
  \ from Hong Kong while in the path of a tornado - the last thing I expected.\n\n\
  Kirsten and I drove the intercept vehicles for Ron, the certified storm chaser.\
  \ He navigates and when Ron says \u201CRun,\u201D you run!\n\nThe Hong Kong crew\
  \ hired Ron for nine days, to take them to a tornado and cannot go back to China\
  \ without tornado footage. But the odds of a \ntornado in Oklahoma, in July - where\
  \ the average number of tornados is one - were zilch! This tornado season was no\
  \ exception. The weather was hot, dry -  it was an actual drought. So we had to\
  \ drive north to attempt any sightings of a tornado, to an area that had an increased\
  \ average of ten tornados in July.\n\nEight hundred and eighty miles later, we were\
  \ just north of Fargo, North Dakota. Parked on the side of a gravel, country road,\
  \ and out of the car, the\nstorm chasers braced ourselves from the power of the\
  \ wind. Then, we caught a glimpse of the tornado hiding behind the dust, dirt and\
  \ debris, we were awestruck.\n\nThe Hong Kong crew was whirling around us getting\
  \ their equipment and the hosts into place. Yan, a host, had one line, \u201Cit\u2019\
  s windy,\u201D but she failed to \nproduce it as she was blown off her feet. The\
  \ Hong Kong crew gathered up Yan and their equipment that was uprooted by the storm.\
  \ They took cover \nunder the open hatch of my intercept vehicle to regroup and\
  \ try to capture the footage they needed.\n\n\u201CRUN!\u201D Ron commanded, as\
  \ he ran to his vehicle.\n\u201CGO! GO!\u201D Ron yelled to Kirsten.  They left\
  \ me in the dust, my passengers still fiddling behind the vehicle under no apparent\
  \ distress.\n\n I watched the other cars drive away at lightning-speed while I approached\
  \ the Hong Kong crew and asked them nicely, \u201CPlease get in the vehicle, it\u2019\
  s \nnot safe. We need to leave now.\u201D With my hand gestures and my tone of voice,\
  \ I was sure they understood but disregarded the urgency. I asked again \nwith more\
  \ intent, to no avail.\n\n\u201CGet in the f**king car, now!\u201D I hollered over\
  \ the roar of the wind. That was about as universal as I could get without physical\
  \ violence. Wide-eyed they \nwere seated in an instant, and we stormed away leaving\
  \ our own trail of dust.\n\nPanic set into the pit of my stomach. Other then a left\
  \ turn on the next country road, I had no idea where the team want or which way\
  \ the storm was \nheading. Little did the Hong Kong crew know, they had just missed\
  \ their only opportunity to capture their tornado. \n \nThis is the life of a storm\
  \ chaser."
