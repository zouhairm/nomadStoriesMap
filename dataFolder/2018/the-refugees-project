Text: "Every One Can Make a Film About The Refugees But Do You Think The Refugees\
  \ Can Make Movies About Them Selves ?\nI met her when i was in Germany last year\
  \ , Mayada Hammid Syrian girl 8 years old . I was talking with her about Syria she\
  \ told me \" I don't remember anything about Syria \" .\nThat was my starting point\
  \ to make a film about those people \" Syrians , Palestinians , Iraqians , Libyans\
  \ and African \" they live in Germany especially in Berlin . I started to follow\
  \ the \" New Europeans \" in there lives and live with them like a refugee . \n\
  There are many people in many Arab country  wants and trying to leave the Arabian\
  \ Area this days because what is happening now , and they are looking at the Arab\
  \ in Europe like the live in the paradise . but those people they live in Europe\
  \ has another opinion , they told me they does not even have the right to travel\
  \ in any country in Europe , just the country they live in , also they said its\
  \ not easy to have a feeling that you will not go back again for your home . \n\
  It's about the Syrians , Palestinians , Africans and the refugees from around the\
  \ world lives in Germany specially in Berlin and they are traveling to Paris  by\
  \ bus for tourism and we found during the time passes they are going to Paris for\
  \ political issues , we found some countries are used the refugees to their demonstrations\
  \ against the governments's systems . Here in our movie you will see country like\
  \ Iran use the refugees to mobilize against the government . And you'll see the\
  \ whole thing from the beginning , how they promised the refugees with good hotels\
  \ , food and good trip to Paris to enjoy the city in return the refugees just to\
  \ show they are a Iranian people in this conference ."
