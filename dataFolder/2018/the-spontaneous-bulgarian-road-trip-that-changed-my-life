Text: "During my time in Bankso, Bulgaria I met Constantine. Our friendship was unexpected\
  \ as there were no two people as visibly different than us. I, a 5'3\" tall American\
  \ girl. Him, a 7' tall Bulgarian man. He asked me to join him, his mother and sister,\
  \ and his girlfriend at the Black Sea for a weekend. I enthusiastically said \"\
  yes!\" I decided not to tell my mom about my spontaneous road trip. I knew she\u2019\
  d freak out and insist that I don\u2019t go. She would panic about me getting in\
  \ a car with a stranger. It seems a typical protective motherly reaction until you\
  \ realize this is a woman who picked up a hitchhiker (my dad) and married him years\
  \ later. My intuition knew that everything was going to be okay. \n\nConstantine\
  \ and I jumped in the small car and drove the six hours to Sozopol, a small, ancient\
  \ seaside town. The days there involved lots of new experiences, each one special\
  \ and surprising. We spent time on the beach, enjoying the salty air, warm breeze,\
  \ and sea. We enjoyed delicious local meals. After the weekend, we drove to Sofia,\
  \ to spend an evening there with Constantine's father and grandmother. By the time\
  \ we arrived, they had prepared a multi-course Bulgarian feast for us. Despite feeling\
  \ exhausted, we enjoyed Bulgarian delicacies with them. At the time I was a vegetarian,\
  \ so imagine my conflict when I saw the steamed cow tongue dish. The grandmother\u2019\
  s face, as she motioned to serve me a piece of tongue, showed pride and joy as if\
  \ she was handing me one of her firstborn children. I couldn\u2019t bear to turn\
  \ it down, so I accepted her gift and slowly cut myself a bite. It tasted chewy\
  \ and slightly uncomfortable. I smiled, thanked her, and ate the other, vegetable\
  \ dishes. In only two days I felt like an adopted member of this Bulgarian family.\
  \ When it came time to leave I felt like leaving my own family behind, and not knowing\
  \ when I would ever see them again. \n\nMy trip to Bulgaria forever changed my life,\
  \ way of traveling, and way of eating. It taught me to say yes to spontaneous adventure\
  \ while traveling, to fully immerse myself in the local culture and community, and\
  \ to open up to the possibility for deep similarities with people even who do not\
  \ seem like you at all. Doing these things makes true local connections possible\
  \ in the moment, and creates memories and lessons learned that will last a lifetime."
