Text: "\u201CSo, when is the baby coming?\u201D I asked excitedly looking at Maya\u2019\
  s slightly bulging stomach as she poured hot curry in my plate. \nShe paused as\
  \ if searching for the right words but just said \u201CNever.\u201D \n\u201CI don't\
  \ understand..?\u201D I asked perplexed. \n\u201CIt\u2019s a girl.\u201D She sighed\
  \ as if in resignation. \u201CYou know, it\u2019s a son who carries on a family\
  \ lineage and takes care of his family while daughters get married and leave them.\
  \ Plus who would collect money all their life just to give it away in dowry. It\u2019\
  s like \u2018watering your neighbor\u2019s lawn\u2019\u201D She said as if parroting\
  \ someone. \nI was speechless. I knew there existed societies where women do not\
  \ get equal rights and are required to live and behave a certain way. But being\
  \ murdered while still in the womb because it\u2019s a girl, I didn\u2019t see this\
  \ coming. \n\u201CSays who?\u201D I finally asked.\n\u201CThe society, didi. My\
  \ husband, my in-laws, everyone.\u201D\n\u201CThis is a crime. It doesn\u2019t matter\
  \ if it\u2019s a girl or a boy. We do not need men to fight in wars anymore. They\
  \ work in offices and earn money and girls can do the same. There is free education\
  \ for all girls up to elementary school and dowry is banned. This is madness Maya.\"\
  \ I stated. \n\"It's how it is here...since the beginning of time\" \n\"Could I\
  \ talk to your in-laws before I leave? Please!\u201D I begged until she hesitantly\
  \ agreed. \n400 miles west of Uttar Pradesh, an elderly couple rejoiced the victory\
  \ of Saina Nehwal in their dingy one bedroom apartment in the city of Mainpuri,\
  \ as she had won yet another Gold in the Asian Games. They turned their heads as\
  \ they heard footsteps approaching. \"Namaste\" I greeted. \n\"This is didi\", Maya\
  \ gave a brief introduction as she pulled a plastic chair for me. I sat across from\
  \ them. An eerie silence set in as they turned off the TV.  \u201CSo, you want Maya\
  \ to abort the baby girl?\u201D I finally asked. I knew I could be thrown out of\
  \ the house. Nervous yet determined, I went on to explain all the reasons why it\u2019\
  s okay to have a girl child. They heard me quietly and thanked me for my inputs\
  \ as I finished and stood to leave. Outside the evening prayers had started and\
  \ the temple bells were chiming. The priests were singing verses in the praises\
  \ of Laxmi, the goddess of wealth and prosperity. \nNext day, I left for New Delhi\
  \ and I never followed up with Maya about the baby for I wasn't prepared to hear\
  \ the answer. I couldn't help but wonder that maybe, some battles will end with\
  \ the end of humanity for their seeds were sown as early as with the beginning of\
  \ one."
