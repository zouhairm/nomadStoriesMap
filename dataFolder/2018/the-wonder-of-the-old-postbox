Text: "Travel makes you like a kid again. Everything's new and exciting - you see\
  \ things that usually hide under the cover of everyday. You walk at the airport\
  \ and you see the last thing you expected to see there: an old postbox, out of place,\
  \ out of time.\n\nIt\u2019s a remnant of an already gone era when it took effort\
  \ to share one\u2019s thoughts in writing \u2013 so one took care of them. We shaped\
  \ them carefully, gave them weight and meaning, we caressed them before letting\
  \ them go, dropping them into a box like this. Oh, that feeling of getting a letter\
  \ prepared with such care, filled with such richness! The nervous excitement of\
  \ watching the postman bringing us treasures, with parts of our loved ones\u2019\
  \ souls. \n\nIts vivid red is in contrast with the greyness of its surroundings\
  \ at the airport. It\u2019s not just the colour of the walls, it\u2019s also their\
  \ invisibility. We look through them \u2013 to our destination or starting point\
  \ but the airport itself is not important. It\u2019s just means to an end. Or to\
  \ a new beginning.\n\nIt\u2019s where we can (and do) numb ourselves with the worst\
  \ of civilisation: shopping for unneccessary (and sometimes borderline useless)\
  \ luxuries, it\u2019s where we drink when we\u2019re not thirsty, eat when we don\u2019\
  t need it, stand on a moving pavement when we\u2019re not in a hurry. It\u2019s\
  \ where we queue even though we\u2019ve got our seat numbers, where we get annoyed\
  \ even though we\u2019re part of a miracle \u2013 and not just because we\u2019\
  re about to fly through air at the height of thousands of metres in a metal box\
  \ but also because we are actually able to go away for holiday or business.\n\n\
  Ask your parents, grandparents: was it this natural for them? Ask the millions who\
  \ barely survive right now, right under where you might fly: what trips are they\
  \ planning? We, who can afford it, are all a minority, not unlike this red post\
  \ box. Its obvious, striking colour is swallowed up by its bland environment, like\
  \ our own wonder by the colourblind every-days. It\u2019s how we end up being like\
  \ shadows of each other despite of our vibrant soul-colour.\n\nHear the whisper\
  \ of this post box: be loud red, be thoughtful, be different, no matter your surrondings.\
  \ Be the wonder that can proudly leave its corner to discover life at its best.\
  \ Be the best of you as you travel through life and countries. That's your only\
  \ job."
