Text: "It was the month of march, when snow caped mountains starts melting and making\
  \ us feel the chills of wind. I along with my friend started a trip to kasol which\
  \ is said to be stoners paradise, but being sober many if my other friends suggested\
  \ me \"why you going there it's not the place for you\", but i want to prove them\
  \ wrong. I knew when I'll return I'm going to be a storyteller who has witnesses\
  \ the heaven in all his consciousness. \nWe are finally in kasol, we booked a stay\
  \ in 'Nomads Hostel' the best place to be in if you visiting Kasol. There we get\
  \ to know tge owner whose jus 25 years of age and built an extraordinary place with\
  \ all his creativity and skills of imagination. He did make lots of fun of us that\
  \ we are engineering students and still sober, but in the end told us very mature\
  \ people you are. He helped us in gaining information about the places and \"trekk\
  \ of kheerganga\", we decided to visit local markets and purchase some of energy\
  \ drinks,bread,butter etc edibles for the trekk as on that peak everything is going\
  \ to be overpriced. \nThe next morning we both geared up to climb that kheerganga\
  \ peak which was i think 3400 meters. \nWe started our trekk at 10 am from base\
  \ camp after having the breakfast from the last hotel which is going to give us\
  \ normal priced food. We heard from locals that its 5-6 hours trekk, but we knew\
  \ that with healthy lungs we will going to achieve this in lesser number of hours.\
  \ Through the trekk we met with various of locals, we enjoyed a game of cricket.\
  \ We came across lot's of water springs, and apple trees which was making the journey\
  \ more beautiful. After 2 hours and 45 min we were jus 3kms below the peak but that\
  \ 3kms was  toughest of all. After 3 hours 40 min of staring we were there at peak,\
  \  we were exhausted but view helped us with some energy. We took a hot bath in\
  \ natural hot water spring after which we never felt that we were in any pain. Then\
  \ we roam that peak and pick a sopt where no other camps were there,\"a decision\
  \ that took us to the edge\" we realized it latter. We set up our tent but then\
  \ my friend realized he's forgot \"sleeping bag\" as it was getting dark the wind\
  \ proved to be more killer, the fire we lighten also gets diminish, we both in the\
  \ middle of night feeling the cold which was spine chilling, i started to vomit.\
  \ We in middle of night shifted our tent. There was a couple over there who lend\
  \ ud blanket. That night i wasn't sure that I'm going to breathe through if those\
  \ couples weren't there."
