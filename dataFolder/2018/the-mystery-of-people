Text: "What could surprise me anymore of this city? Five years aren\u2019t sufficient\
  \ to just explore it in all her little ravines, in all her intricate details and\
  \ minute imagines? I\u2019ve seen her both in daylight than under the reflexes of\
  \ the moon. I explored her streets ravaged by a storm and cradled by the voice of\
  \ a lone musician under the arches of an ancient palace. I assumed, for a moment,\
  \ that Rome has stopped to impress me. San Pietro would always be San Pietro, but,\
  \ memorized all the little minutiae of the statues that look from the sky to the\
  \ ground the tourists and the priests, it seems a lot less spectacular.\nInstead,\
  \ in the moment of frustration that hit me for this assumption, I saw a young couple\
  \ kisses between the stalls along the Tiber. A kiss, the more classical, normal,\
  \ common act of love that is possible to see. Now, normally, that would have pass\
  \ as nothing. Just the life that goes along, for its own way. It was probably the\
  \ fact that I was in the middle of this reflection about my city, that the kiss\
  \ hit me like an epiphany. I had this music in the ears and that scene in front\
  \ of me and the terrible thought that my beloved city was, for me, totally explored.\
  \ The kiss was a divine reminder of something I was not thinking more about.\nWalking\
  \ along the Tiber and in the middle of the streets full of tourists and romans and\
  \ expats, simply sitting on a table near the church of Santa Maria in Trastevere,\
  \ drinking a beer just in the middle of San Lorenzo, all this observing the people,\
  \ give me a new perspective, a real new perspective, about the life of Rome. \n\
  The city was all to explore again, trying to see not the beautiful buildings or\
  \ the majestic skyline of the ancient market of Adriano. The point was walking among\
  \ the fallen stones, observing the people. The real travel, the one that I was missing,\
  \ it was all there. All the sense of the city is enclosed in the apparently stupid,\
  \ common actions that everyone takes just in every moment of his, or her, life.\
  \ The real travel in Rome was between the people, maybe not interacting with them,\
  \ maybe as simple observer, but is in their lives that is possible to undercover\
  \ the real meaning of a great city. It surprised me that it took so long to understand\
  \ that the travel is not between the buildings, but the people of a city. Rome,\
  \ Istanbul or Rabat, Prague or London, are a surprise because its people will always\
  \ surprise you, simple living."
