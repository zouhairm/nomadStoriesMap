Text: "I started walking towards the water, unsure. The waves washed over my ankles.\
  \ I kept walking. Reached my knees. I didn't stop. Rose till my thigh. I continued\
  \ on. Rushed to my waist. I kept walking. Every wave caressed a previously untouched\
  \ part of my body, icy cold, rising higher, growing bolder each time. Scandalous.\
  \ Disgraceful. Free. \nMy legs looked like something out a cartoon. Bright blue,\
  \ denim-clad, jelly-like, the rising sun throwing pink rays on it. Pink for girls,\
  \ blue for boys, the lines between the colours blurring with the rising sea. Every\
  \ step felt like the first breath of air after drowning. Ironic, considering how\
  \ dangerously close I was to drowning. I don't know what changed in me that day.\
  \ I'm usually a rule following, society fearing, good little Indian girl. A lifetime\
  \ of living within the constraints of rules loomed ahead, rules that were not my\
  \ own. Maybe it was my insurgence hitting puberty too late, or just the first day\
  \ of the rest of my life, but I was determined. I was dreaming of my own life. Independent.\
  \ Unbound. Free. The darkness engulfed everything, my body, the sand, the waves\
  \ and the sun, an ocean of black, wearing Hades' helm of darkness. I was relying\
  \ on my ears for the most part. My white hijab wrapped tightly around my head, I\
  \ heard the ocean before I saw it. The splash of the waves got closer, an orchestra\
  \ of a million conch shells, and soon the sun's rays danced on the ocean in a million\
  \ shades. I began the walk to Dharmadom Island, from Asia's largest drive-in beach,\
  \ ready to watch the sky change from coal to fire. Fiery. Passionate. Free. The\
  \ island, a sleeping giant, dotted with emerald palms and I, between it all, a part\
  \ of God's kaleidoscope. I hesitated, thinking of various scenarios and the unnecessity\
  \ of it all. But I needed this, and before I knew it, I was surrounded by the ocean\
  \ on all sides. Unrestrained. Powerful. Free. I stepped on the island, out of the\
  \ sea foam, smelling like the sea. The sun brighter and warmer now, the breeze still\
  \ cool. Cinnamon brown rocks dotted the island, and tiny plants were fighting to\
  \ grow in between, their own battle. I was alone, but never less lonely. Marooned\
  \ on an island, never so free. In one fluid motion, I whipped off my white hijab,\
  \ closed my eyes, and let it wave in the wind. Like a white flag. I was surrendering\
  \ to the universe. A gale of wind took the scarf out of my hand. It flew with the\
  \ wind. Like a white flag. It was the universe surrendering to me."
