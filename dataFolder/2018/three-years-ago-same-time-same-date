Text: "We had spent the whole day on foot. What were we doing?\n \nWe were reaching\
  \ breath taking viewpoints, surviving narrow commercial areas that herd tourists\
  \ like cows in a ranch, taking in the cool mountain air, feeling the eucalyptus\
  \ vapors singe our stretching sinews, going to places that said- \u2018No Entry\u2019\
  , and later paying for it, floating on the clouds and feeling insecure about our\
  \ weight, every time we saw a skinny couple.\n \nMy wife Shruti and I were spending\
  \ our wedding anniversary on the hills of Kodaikanal in South India. And we enjoy\
  \ these long walks as opposed to the typical tourist itinerary with the hired taxi.\
  \ \n\nThe long walk did get painful after a while. My joints yelling out to me and\
  \ calling for a rest. We sat down in a nice spot slightly away from the crowds at\
  \ a place called- 'Upper lake view'. We learn to ignore the garbage that lies everywhere\
  \ in these view points and focus only on the view. Unlike the hordes that gorge\
  \ on the view like the packet of chips that they discard on the side of the hill\
  \ where no human hands can retrieve them, we like to savor the view.\n \nBut one\
  \ budding photographer did not allow us to savor it. \"Sir, ma\u2019am please move...\
  \ I would like to take a photo,\" he said. \n\n\"Well take your picture. Who is\
  \ stopping you?\" said I. \n\nHe persisted, waving his hand like we were the crow\
  \ that sat on his meal. We ignored him and continued our savoring.\n \nWe walk far\
  \ away from the commercial road, with the jammed buses and the smoke spewing trucks.\
  \ \n \nA couple of ladies were carrying a huge pile of wood on their heads and walking\
  \ through a meadow.\n \nWe ended up following them. One of the women had so much\
  \ happening in her life and was sharing it with her friend. We did not listen to\
  \ the exact words but we knew that it was important to her, for her narration contained\
  \ the emotions worthy of an Oscar. The friend listened with a 'hmmm' and a 'ahan.'\n\
  \ \nThe path they took us on was a lot shorter, a lot more beautiful, a lot more\
  \ deserted. The maddening crowds and their bags of chips were nowhere to be seen.\n\
  \ \nThey stopped at a local church. We watch at the gate and were about to leave,\
  \ but the women stopped us. They had just placed their wood by the side of the road.\
  \ \n\n\"You must go inside. Quick, they close the church at five pm,\" one of them\
  \ said.\n \nFive  pm was the time Shruti marched into a church. I was waiting at\
  \ the altar and the music was playing. It was the 26th of December. The exact day,\
  \ the exact time, three years ago."
