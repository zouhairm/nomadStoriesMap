Text: "I was in the middle of the pedestrian trail, in the beautiful landscapes of\
  \ the island of Flowers, in the archipelago of Azores. Had already walked on an\
  \ extensive plateau, pinned here and there by multicolored hydrangeas. The sight\
  \ that such a movie screen passed in my eyes, was of a paradisiacal garden.\nI saw\
  \ Azorean kites gliding high and I thought how majestic were those beautiful birds\
  \ of prey, which with one meter and thirty in length, could from above, be kings\
  \ of the blue sky. \nThe plateau ended with the island's first cliff. I passed close\
  \ to goats who looked at me with the same astonishment as I looked at them. They\
  \ moved such graceful dancers, although clinging with slender ferocity to the stones.\
  \ I descended cautiously and reached a brook. This brook cut sharply two portentous\
  \ and imposing mountains. Several times I tripped on dry branches. I fell only once,\
  \ but I got up. Gradually I realized that the flow became stronger, it had become\
  \ a wild river. The margins full of forest, overflowing with life. Carefully I step\
  \ in the forest. Little by little I felt myself growing smaller and smaller in that\
  \ immensity as I walked in the beaten path.\nI saw gigantic tree roots clinging\
  \ to the huge rocks as their green branches stretched searching sun. A little further\
  \ was a waterfall and the foam splashed my eyes. But I wanted to finish, to know\
  \ that I had overcome the obstacles, that came up along the way, which, like life\
  \ itself, was so often stony. \n I get to the heart of the island. The water lines\
  \ were everywhere, dripping down the stone walls. Until I came to a descent. Here\
  \ the moss had a harbinger of betrayal. It glowed with the water drops, that ran\
  \ down his beautifully green skin. I looked at the ground and saw the tips of my\
  \ mountain boots, once blue, now earthy, on a nonexistent path. On the other side\
  \ of the way a small stone wall, flanked by immense vegetation. I couldn`t seen\
  \ whatever was behind. \nI saw that were trees, among the vegetation, so I decided\
  \ to swing to one of the branches. The last thing I expected was for the branch\
  \ to split. My body felt on the wall. That's when I saw something that amazed me\
  \ completely. The branches of the tree, as they left, foresaw what was behind the\
  \ wall. The unimaginable. An extremely high and rough cliff. Deep down there was\
  \ a virgin beach full of goblins and then the sea in all its immensity.\nAnd I felt\
  \ so small, like a chess piece. But as always and once more, I got up and went on\
  \ my way."
