Text: "From November 2017 until January 2018 I embarked on a trip to places I'd never\
  \ visited, I had been gripped by wander lust. Namibia was the first country I went\
  \ and I experienced Windhoek but there was a bonus I managed to squeeze in Swakopmund\
  \ and Walvis Bay as well. For the first time in my life I saw the vast wide ocean\
  \ and with it came a plethora of emotions. Whilst Namibia was a land of intense\
  \ sharp beauty with its contrast of stark desert landscape on one end and scenic\
  \ ocean views on the other it was in Durban, South Africa where I had quite an extraordinary\
  \ experience. It was on one sunny day that Jamie and I went to Umhlanga beach. The\
  \ plan was to walk along the beach whilst talking about anything and everything.\
  \ It being my last week in Durban I was feeling quite melancholic on this particular\
  \ day so we figured the beach would pacify the broody mood. As we walked along the\
  \ beach we took pictures and somewhere along we met a friendly local Indian Vinay\
  \ whom we had small talk with. It was at that spot where I decided to take pictures\
  \ with the background of the waves coming in,little did I know that I was about\
  \ to have a unique experience. I placed my sandals, which I had taken off to walk\
  \ on the sand, on a rock in order to take selfies and after taking one picture I\
  \ turned to face the water. Before I could react a high wave came in and washed\
  \ away my sandals which had been perched on the rock. For a short while I was shaken\
  \ with how fast things had happened but immediately after I laughed out loud, a\
  \ genuine hearty laugh. Jamie laughed with me and we continued walking along the\
  \ beach almost in stitches about the \u201Clost shoes at sea\u201D. Vinay, who at\
  \ that point was some distance behind us was left a little dazed at our reaction\
  \ then about thirty metres from the fateful rock I felt a sharp intense pain under\
  \ my right foot; I had been bitten by something! After the pain had subsided we\
  \ continued our promenade, deciding to go and buy ice-cream along the pathway with\
  \ hotels lining up the seashore. Barefoot as I was all I could think about was how\
  \ peculiar it was that the Indian Ocean took my shoes. We walked along the path\
  \ in the direction we had come from to get an Uber. Strolling along I noticed Vinay\
  \ still at the spot we had met him and he waved to us, I waved back and just then\
  \ he lifted up his hand and there were my sandals! I squealed running towards Vinay\
  \ taking my sandals and thanking him profusely. The ocean returned my sandals! This\
  \ was the last thing I ever expected to happen to me in my life."
