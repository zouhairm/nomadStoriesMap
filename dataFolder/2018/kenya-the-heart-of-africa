Text: "The rhythm of the plains is a drum inside my chest. It is the beat of a thousand\
  \ hooves, kicking up scorched brown dust against a hazy summer sky. A Masai woman\
  \ grips my hand tightly, her dark eyes twinkling with mischief. We jump together,\
  \ singing and laughing, as we encourage the warriors to take flight, blood-red shuka's\
  \ lifting like wings into the sky. I leave with her colourful bangles jangling on\
  \ my wrist. She leaves with a piece of my heart. \n\nThis is Kenya. \n\nWe stalk\
  \ quietly through swaying grass. A Swahili lullaby crackles through the safari radio,\
  \ directing our driver, Miaw, to the furthest corner of this sacred place. Our eyes\
  \ widen as a herd of giraffe lumber across the savannah, and we beg him to stop\
  \ the car. We long to capture their patchwork skin and fluttering lashes, but we\
  \ know we can never do their perfection justice. Miaw scolds us, his scarred face\
  \ frowning. 'These are not the animals,' he tells us seriously. 'We are looking\
  \ for Simba.'\n \nOn we go. Past majestic elephants shooting plumes of water high\
  \ up into the sky, trumpeting a warning as we venture too close. Past the swarm\
  \ of vultures that rip and tear and screech as blood soaks into the parched earth.\
  \ Death is never far here, and bleached white bones remind us that this is a wild\
  \ place. We are guests only, honoured by this window into their world.\n\nA cheetah\
  \ mother creeps ahead, ears bobbing up over golden stalks, hiding her from view.\
  \ Her cubs stick close to her. I am mesmerised as she springs into action, a documentary\
  \ scene unfolding in front of my eyes. She is a blur against the horizon, appearing\
  \ to miss her mark as she passes the panicked impala. I cannot tear my eyes from\
  \ them, as she skilfully herds them back towards her cubs, her intention becoming\
  \ clear too late. The smell of blood pervades the car as we pull up alongside them.\
  \ They ignore us, heads enveloped in the carcass, powerfully ripping at their meal.\
  \ \n\nThe Rangers arrive, shouting that we are too close, and we speed off into\
  \ the sunset, avoiding their reprimand. Miaw sighs in relief at our escape. The\
  \ cost of their wrath is his license and his livelihood with it. He turns back to\
  \ grin at us with a cheeky thumbs up. \n\nAs the sun sets he tells us stories of\
  \ his adventures and his dance with death after a poisonous snake bite. He warns\
  \ us of the lions that roam our camp at night, no fences to protect us. I dare not\
  \ move, snug in my sleeping bag. I fall asleep to the call of the lion, and in my\
  \ dreams, I answer."
