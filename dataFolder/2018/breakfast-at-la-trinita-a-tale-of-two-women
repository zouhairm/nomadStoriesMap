Text: "In the quiet cool of the morning, I pause at my window to peek into the monastery\
  \ garden with its vegetables and herbs, flowers and fruit trees. Sometimes a Sister\
  \ works there, but usually it is empty and still. Tile-roofed stone buildings descend\
  \ the Tuscan hillside beyond, accented by the square symmetry and intricate dome\
  \ of Santa Maria Nuovo, all contained by the grand view of the fertile Val di Chiana.\n\
  \nMy reverie dissolves as the others move toward the door. A small contingent of\
  \ the study abroad program in Cortona, we reside in Il Monastero della Santissima\
  \ Trinit\xE0, built by Cistercians in 1545. Now, in 1985, a community of Sisters\
  \ remains, and provides Benedictine hospitality to travelers.\n\nWe head downstairs\
  \ to a small, warm room with terra cotta floors and barrel vaulted ceiling. As we\
  \ chat, two women arrive with our simple meal. They move about silently while we\
  \ gear up for the day ahead. Soon it is time for art history and studio classes,\
  \ followed by dinner and gelato, then the steep journey back to sleep at La Trinit\xE0\
  .\n\nAnd then it is morning again, and breakfast. In time, I become more aware of\
  \ the women. The older, a classic nonna, wears dark cotton dresses, gray hair pulled\
  \ up simply from her lined face. Solid, resolute, knowing, she goes about her life's\
  \ work of serving and nurturing. The younger, understated but modern, wears jeans\
  \ and a t-shirt, or a printed skirt and cotton blouse. If she were sitting among\
  \ us she might blend in, only her carefree ease and tousled hair marking her as\
  \ Italian.\n\nAgainst the bustle and novelty of our daily schedule and weekend excursions\
  \ to Florence, Siena, Orvieto, and Pisa, rests this humble, steady vignette: two\
  \ women carrying trays of melba toast and jam, sugar and milk.\n\nCaff\xE8? the\
  \ young one asks. S\xEC, per favore, I answer, holding the deep white cup while\
  \ she pours from a large copper vessel. The nonna clears away what remains. Grazie.\
  \ Prego. And again the next morning and the next, our exchange of small smiles and\
  \ nods of acknowledgment. Too shy to ask, I begin to wonder about them. What brought\
  \ them to this place, how they feel about serving us, who they are when they're\
  \ not here.\n\nI carry this with me, acknowledging the unknown yet complete life\
  \ of those I encounter. I remind myself that the older woman is very old, or gone;\
  \ the younger, like me, is now the older. Did she stay or move on? Has she traveled,\
  \ had children, been disappointed, or satisfied? Does she pull her hair up, or leave\
  \ it down?"
