Text: "I wasn\u2019t a kid anymore and barely the grown-up I thought I was. Yet, it\
  \ seems that for the first time, the stars were aligning in favour of a collective\
  \ effort to create the perfect \u2018life is falling apart\u2019 situation. Was\
  \ this even happening? A couple of weeks ago, I was planning the experience of a\
  \ lifetime, a sweet escape only dreams and chick flicks allow. A couple of weeks\
  \ ago, I was a 21 year-old with an amazing boyfriend and two incredible girlfriends.\
  \ Well, that was a couple of weeks ago. \n\nAlthough time is a funny dimension which\
  \ supposingly measures what the clock reads, it felt like my watch must have gone\
  \ beyond our narrow temporal limits because these people were no longer by my side\
  \ and tomorrow I wouldn\u2019t be home anymore. In fact, in less than 24 hours and\
  \ for the five months to come, home would be a whole new place. Tomorrow, my $150\
  \ one-way ticket will take me to the mastermind behind Lego, the land of Hansel\
  \ and Gretel, the home of the most forward-thinking designers and the happiest country\
  \ in the world. How ironic is that? \n\u201CBreathe. You can do this. Or maybe you\
  \ can\u2019t. Do I have my toothbrush? How do I say toothbrush in Danish? What on\
  \ earth am I doing \u201D, was all I had in mind. While I was few seconds away to\
  \ collapse in front of Gate A53, never ever have I felt so confused... and free.\
  \ When the stewardess and her perfect hair bun touched my shoulder with a bright\
  \ smile asking the one question I didn\u2019t think I could answer, my mouth spoke\
  \ a truth my brain was not yet aware of. No sooner had she asked if I was ready\
  \ to take off than a spontaneous \u201CYes, I am\u201D erupted in the air. \n\n\
  In a place where I understood that being alone was far from being lonely, the last\
  \ thing I expected was self-discovery. Who would have thought that a mixed-race\
  \ girl would have learnt to accept her afro hair for the first time in the far north?\
  \ That exchanging a car for a good old bike would be so liberating? That genuine\
  \ kindness wouldn't have a name, location or face? I wouldn\u2019t and I would have\
  \ been terribly wrong to. After all, stereotypes are meant to be challenged and\
  \ there are most certainly things that just a plane ticket can allow you to explore.\
  \ While I was somehow convinced that going away could be perceived as a desperate\
  \ attempt of escaping, the last thing I expected from the country wherein an airplane\
  \ is actually said \u2018flying-machine\u2019 (\u2018Flyvemaskine\u2019 in Danish)\
  \ was to rock my world and replace all I knew with one single word: more."
