Text: "It was 5th may 2016 and i was working on my office as regularly i use to do,\
  \ one of my friend called me and told me about to book a bike trip to ladhak i didnt\
  \ have a vacation from last 2 years and i wanted a break from this nine to five\
  \ life and i too had some savings so without thinking much i said yes lets go\n\
  And it all started there i met group of 32 people one of the best bunches of people\
  \ i ever met they were from all over the world ,with different colour, relegion\
  \ and language although they were all same after all we all are from same breed\n\
  \ we took our seats in our bus and we were off to manali , manali our ''indian switzerland\"\
  \ we were given common instructions by our leader and the bike journey started and\
  \ while riding through the himalyan valleys experiencing such beautiful landscape\
  \ that true natural beauty made me feel so good and after a long time i felt that\
  \ much happy and it was a moment i still remember and that thing made me realize\
  \ that in those last 25 years of my life this was my first good memory , a memory\
  \ a moments which takes a second a minute to create i wasn't having it even a one\
  \ earlier\nAnd while traveling to those mighty mountains i found myself who was\
  \ lost somewhere\n that wanderlust hitted me\nSo hard that after that all i want\
  \ was travelling because it makes me happy than anything else in this world even\n\
  A one lakh cheque never made me so happy but when i got a on the top reading that\
  \ board \" welcome to the world's highest motorable pass\" i cried out of joy\n\
  And after that i realized that in my short life i should run after happiness not\
  \ money and \nFrom that time onwards i have kept on travelling i have made 100 of\
  \ good memories which i wasn't having even a one 2 year back\nSo that simple decision\
  \ of saing yes to that trip pushed me to my edge to find my real happiness"
