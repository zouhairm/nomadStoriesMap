Text: "Three housewives cross their Christian Louboutins and sip Darjeeling II from\
  \ the comfort of velvet cushions. They sit on display in the window of the Capital\
  \ Hotel on Basil Street, a stop along London\u2019s elite playground just steps\
  \ away from the garish opulence of Harrods department store. My roommates and I\
  \ wear Primark clearance, and our nasal accents cut through our clotted cream. It\
  \ seemed, to us yanks anyhow, that afternoon tea would be the great equalizer, accessible\
  \ to the Queen and her plumber alike. So, we continue to drink up our delusions.\
  \ \n\nWe finish the salmon and watercress triangles and gold-flecked cheesecake\
  \ and venture out into Knightsbridge. It\u2019s 3pm. The stores are already boarded,\
  \ and riot police pace. Today, England is burning.\n\nJust days earlier, on August\
  \ 4, 2011, Mark Duggan, a young black man, was shot by an officer near Tottenham\
  \ Hale station. Misleading police reports about an exchange of fire were proven\
  \ fictitious, and the shot heard round the world was the final declaration of class\
  \ war. The ensuing riots shattered the British composure we had become accustomed\
  \ to for six weeks\u2014an emotional dam we assumed too strong to break. Now, double-decker\
  \ buses engulfed in flames circulated cable news broadcasts as black youth and rebellious\
  \ heads of pink and purple hair dumped their tea into the proverbial harbor. From\
  \ Brixton to Liverpool, the anger festered. \n\nWe walk along parked Aston Martins\
  \ to our flat in central Belgravia, the neighborhood we miraculously get to call\
  \ home. The locals are too polite to call our bluff, though our brick public housing\
  \ complex stands as a reverse oasis. The gum under the Louboutin shoe. Next to our\
  \ doorstep, shattered glass surrounds the currency exchange and the Hugo Boss storefront.\
  \ As an American, I know this scene all too well. I\u2019ve seen it follow presidents\
  \ and hurricanes. But who could predict, in the land of Keep Calm and Carry On,\
  \ it would become my personal image of Londontown. \n\nA toddler cries in the hallway\
  \ where we like to peruse a pile of books left on the ground by families fleeing\
  \ the building\u2019s scheduled wrecking ball. Inside, I steep more tea and pack\
  \ my things\u2014a painting of the South Bank, soaps from Bath. \n\n\u201CAre you\
  \ sure you\u2019re safe? Do you need an earlier flight?\u201D My dad says while\
  \ watching CNN, but this turn of events only makes me want to stay and watch the\
  \ fury. London is no longer a wealthy stranger to me, having whispered her dark\
  \ secrets in my ear over afternoon tea."
