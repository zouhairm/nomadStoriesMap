Text: "\u201CAh, Minsk next.\u201D says Igor. \u201CNice place. Very clean. Shops\
  \ have no signs.\u201D\n\nThree vodkas in, this takes a moment to process.\n\n\u201C\
  Nice place. Very clean,\u201D he repeats slowly, \u201Cshops have no signs. You\
  \ must go in to see what shop sells. It is difficult.\u201D\n\nMy cabin mate on\
  \ the Cologne-Moscow sleeper, he\u2019s eighty-four, sprightly, from Rostov-on-Don,\
  \ and full of such statements. As a young man he\u2019d met Churchill and FDR at\
  \ the Yalta conference, played chess against Karpov. \n\n\u201COne more?\u201D Julia\
  \ asks. She\u2019s smart, beautiful, Belarusian.\n Igor shakes his head. \u201C\
  Sure.\u201D I say. \n\nThe vodka and the whispering rush of the country passing\
  \ outside in the dark work a magic. We talk of home, work, travel, dreams. The faded\
  \ brown leather benches of the dining car empty around us. Suddenly: Minsk.\n\n\
  We say goodbye on the platform. Watching her disappear into the orange glow of the\
  \ subway I sigh, breathing in the autumn melancholy of the station, noticing the\
  \ chill in the air. \n\nTurning, I find a soldier standing between me and the train,\
  \ blocking my path. \n\n\u201CExcuse me, Izvinite\u201D\n\n\u2018Niet\u2019\n\n\u2018\
  Izvinite, I need to get back on\u2019.\n\n\u2018Niet\u2019 he says again. He has\
  \ a huge gun.\n\nI fumble in vain for my ticket; it must be back in my cabin. To\
  \ my horror, I realise that so too are my phone, wallet and passport. \n\nDespite\
  \ the cold, I start to sweat.\n\nI step back and he nods, walking away down the\
  \ platform. \n\nFuck it. As he looks away, I run to the train, jumping the steps\
  \ in one. I keep running. It\u2019s a long train, and my cabin is eight or nine\
  \ carriages away at least. The first, second, third, are dark and deserted. A line\
  \ from the guidebook comes screaming back at me \u2018The train splits at Minsk,\
  \ with only one half continuing to Moscow\u2019. \n  \nWith rising panic I pick\
  \ up speed. Six carriages down, the door handle sticks in my hand. I try it again.\
  \ Locked. I try the exterior door. Locked. I feel sick and I\u2019m pouring with\
  \ sweat. I run back the way I came, trying every exterior door as I go, all locked.\
  \ Reaching the dining car, I find the door I entered by still open. I pass the soldier,\
  \ realising he\u2019d simply been stopping me from entering the wrong carriage.\n\
  \nThere\u2019s a small man right at the front of the train, gesticulating manically.\
  \ Igor. He sees me and points. The driver leans out, nods. I sprint.\nMoments later,\
  \ as the train pulls away, it starts to snow. We stand outside our cabin, breathing\
  \ hard. He looks at me.\n\n\u201CYou must be careful my friend, you are not in England\
  \ anymore. This is Russia\u201D"
