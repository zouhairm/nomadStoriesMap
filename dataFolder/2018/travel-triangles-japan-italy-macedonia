Text: "What excited me the most was meeting a very nice Japanese man... in Macedonia.\n\
  Let\u2019s go into details: Japanese culture is very fascinating and I had  eventually\
  \ the chance to know more about it while I was going for a boat trip to some famous\
  \ Macedonian caves; that day I was walking through a very narrow and sometimes slippery\
  \ path which seemed to have no end. After I was starting feeling desperate I met\
  \ the person that changed my day and mood!\nA middle aged Japanese man, talking\
  \ English without Japanese accent and with a very positive approach, so that we\
  \ immediately started to talk (also because we both lost the way, that increased\
  \ empathy and we finished after three or four hours. \nI gained, in a very pleasant\
  \ but unusual way (that is: I was being careful not to slip into the river and not\
  \ to encounter dangerous animals) a lot of information about the Japanese families,\
  \ their habits, their working culture, their mentality and what made it easier was\
  \ the fact that this Japanese man had also some European culture, given that for\
  \ many years he had been living in Brussels. Ok, let\u2019s delve deep in those\
  \ differences. \nFirst of all: we are completely different :)! They (Japanese) are\
  \ tidy, silent, organised, workers, respectful towards others. We (Italians) are\
  \ noisy, lazy, sleepy (in the South), sly (sometimes in a positive sense, some not),\
  \ unrespectful of others and of public things, we try to get the most doing the\
  \ least :)(\nOther than these first rough approximations, that would let Italians\
  \ lose, there were also some other points of view that made me reflect over my compatriots\
  \ (they must have some positive features, though ;p) and they were: we work but\
  \ not too much, we don\u2019t sell our private life to our employer, we save it\
  \ and try to enjoy it at its best (the country also offers us lots of natural-historical\
  \ landscapes, sun, food, culture and so on; we usually don\u2019t respect our country\
  \ but we take advantage of it). We also have a different attitude towards our family\
  \ in the sense that we care first about our families, then about any other things.\
  \ For Japanese people, instead, company and work come first, family is something\
  \ to devote to in the spare time (very little, to be honest) as well as their private\
  \ life.\nIn conclusion, travelling is always an experience, that opens your mind\
  \ and gives you an unredictable chance to change your lifestyle and point of view.\n\
  So, keep travelling and enjoy it till the end !"
