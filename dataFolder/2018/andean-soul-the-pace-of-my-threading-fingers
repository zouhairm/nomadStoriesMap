Text: "It was the feeling of her dark, thick hair slipping through my fingers as I\u2019\
  m braiding it. The earthy scent of her skin, the smell of sugar cane melting and\
  \ wood burning.  As the sound of my peers chanting and playing guitar by the bonfire\
  \ embraces us, she undoes the braid in silence. So, I start again. \n\nHer universe\
  \ beats at the rhythm of pan flutes and a dry, slow breeze that blows tirelessly.\
  \ Hot corn, shy gazes, Andean stars. Climbing mountains to get to school and raising\
  \ baby brothers. Looking at a map wishing that someday, if luck is on her side,\
  \ she\u2019ll make it to the big city: Buenos Aires. The city of fury, where I was\
  \ born and raised. \n\nWhere a year ago sirens were wailing and the police were\
  \ shooting people in the streets while the president escaped in a helicopter. It\
  \ was December 2001 when the hopes of my generation got buried under the rubble\
  \ of a country that bent so violently that broke. Now all I see are kids inhaling\
  \ glue by the train rails, begging shoeless by the bus stop; enlarging the statistic\
  \ that says that 7 out of 10 kids live in poverty. But she asks me if I eat every\
  \ day and when I say yes, she smiles. Because she doesn\u2019t. \n\nBut now, as\
  \ if I\u2019m writing a new story at the pace of my fingers moving, I keep weaving.\
  \ One two three tighter\u2026one, two, three, tighter\u2026\n\nI am a teenager that\
  \ came on a Scouts summer camp to Yavi. Far north by the Bolivian border, forgotten\
  \ when the Royal Road disappeared. A village under the spell of a colonial past,\
  \ moving in slow motion through history. But as mine is the time and theirs is the\
  \ clock, I ease into the daily rituals. \n\nThere\u2019s an energetic priestess\
  \ that celebrates mass in the antique, small, gold ornamented chapel. She prays\
  \ loudly amongst angel figures and Virgin Mary statues with severe expressions and\
  \ angry looks. \u2014 To scare the natives, so they fear God \u2014 she tells me\
  \ as she looks up in divine concordance. \n\nWe go to school. We dance folklore.\
  \ Even compete in the town\u2019s Olympics, and as I hold my friend\u2019s hand\
  \ we hear a lively man that\u2019s had more than a few drinks scream \u201CYaviiiiii!\u201D\
  , echoed by a cheerful crowd of 10 people or so. Just another excuse to laugh. Summer\
  \ goes by. We make friends, have bonfires. And make braids.\n\nSuddenly, like waking\
  \ up from a bad dream, we let hope make its way back to us.  Away from hunger, far\
  \ from broken countries. \n\nRosa hands me flowers she\u2019s been keeping all this\
  \ time. She wants them in her braid because \u2014 this time \u2014 she will keep\
  \ it."
