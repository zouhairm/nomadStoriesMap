Text: "I need to pee, it\u2019s so cold my nipples hurt, and I\u2019m about to meet\
  \ the Dalai Lama. These were my thoughts as the first day of 2018 shrugged off the\
  \ skin of the year before. While my friends at home were rinsing off their hangovers\
  \ in the bubbling Gold Coast surf, I was blue-lipped and shivering, in a tiny Buddhist\
  \ school on the outskirts of Varanasi. \nCompared to the dusty streets that stretched\
  \ out around it, the school was an oasis. Monks and nuns flowed like their robes\
  \ along the cobbled pathways, while vibrant flowers rushed about the grounds, hugging\
  \ the colourful buildings and sprawling through the soft lawns. \nAs exchange students,\
  \ we\u2019d already met the Dalai Lama\u2019s physician who\u2019d told us tales\
  \ of the monk\u2019s mind-reading abilities. Jittering in the cold, I joked to my\
  \ friend, Jimmy, that I\u2019d quite like His Holiness to read my mind, so long\
  \ as he didn\u2019t dig into the dark stuff. \nTime felt as frozen as we were; seconds\
  \ no longer moving in succession but meandering around each other like snowflakes.\
  \ Jimmy and I continued to joke. I won\u2019t divulge the content but on a scale\
  \ of one to \u201Cthings you should never joke about,\u201D we were at a \u201C\
  definitely going to hell.\u201D Then a whisper tickled through the monks. His Holiness\
  \ was there.  \nHe greeted us, joined our group and posed, like a pro, for a picture.\
  \ But then moved off, not waiting for the questions we\u2019d so meticulously prepared.\
  \ We slumped. That was it. With graceful, shuffling steps, he headed for the gate.\
  \ \nWe waited in respectful silence, expecting nothing more from him. But then he\
  \ stopped. Just a foot away from me, he turned, his face filling my vision, eyes\
  \ holding mine in a floating hug. His lips curled into a knowing smile as he told\
  \ me I must tend to my mental hygiene. He raised an eyebrow and shifted his gaze\
  \ to Jimmy. \nHe told us of the work it takes to achieve emotional hygiene and then\
  \ leaned in so close I could feel the flow of his breath. His voice fell into a\
  \ quiet tone that drew everyone in as they strained to hear. \u201CLook at my face.\u201D\
  \ We waited, sensing something powerful was about to be delivered. \u201CI\u2019\
  m eighty-three years old. Look pretty good!\u201D He laughed. The tension broke\
  \ and, as we giggled, he slapped Jimmy in the face, and walked off. \nHand on his\
  \ cheek, Jimmy turned to me, eyes saying what his mouth didn\u2019t need to. Later\
  \ that day, as if to prove the great man\u2019s point, we managed to find the Indian\
  \ version of strippers. But that, dear reader, is a story for another day."
