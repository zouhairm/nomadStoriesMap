Text: "Jakarta hulks like a gargoyle on the west end of Java. Even the kind Indonesian\
  \ woman running the hostel is shocked that I plan to spend a week here. \u2018People\
  \ only go through Jakarta, don\u2019t stop here,\u2019 she says in broken English,\
  \  \u2018Maybe you go Yogyakarta or Bali?\u2019\n\nForeigners in Jakarta don\u2019\
  t take the bus, and there are curious stares as I cram my way past the broken turnstiles\
  \ onto another sweltering automobile. I meet my Indonesian friend at the Batavia,\
  \ a restaurant from the Dutch colonial days that seems to specialize in nostalgia\
  \ without recalling any colonial pain.  It made me uncomfortable. Aside from the\
  \ waiters, she is the only Indonesian in the restaurant. Down a side street decade-old\
  \ burnt-out Chinese businesses grow over with ivy, a muted testimony to a history\
  \ of racial violence. \n\nI give up on the buses and decide to walk. Sticky heat\
  \ frizzes my hair and sweat bead through my long clothing. It feels hard to breath.\
  \ It is kitten season, and in between the street hawkers and gridlocked cars are\
  \ dozens of tiny mangy bodies burrowing through passing legs seeking food or attention.\
  \ There are no sidewalks, just concrete slabs over sewers, most of which are broken\
  \ or missing. I hold my skirt up to my knees and jump from one slab to the next.\
  \ Everywhere, there are dead cats: in the gutters, along the sides of the road,\
  \ floating in the canals. \n\nI head toward the harbour. It is supposed to be beautiful\
  \ and filled with old boats. I pass cardboard homes huddled against opulent office\
  \ buildings and a Starbucks protecting guests from beggars with security guards.\
  \ I watch as a slight woman walk to the banks of a canal. She pushes garbage out\
  \ of the way before dipping her cooking pot into the water. A man slinks down from\
  \ the shadows under one of the bridges and approaches me. \u2018You shouldn\u2019\
  t be here,\u2019 he advises, twisting his soiled shirt in his hands, \u2018it\u2019\
  s not safe.\u2019\n\nI escape into the Indonesian History Museum. School groups\
  \ dart like birds around displays, ignoring their content to snap photos of me on\
  \ their cell phones. Occasionally a courageous student approaches, \u2018Hello?\u2019\
  , \u2018What is your name?\u2019 \u2018Do you like Indonesia?\u2019 They ask, bubbling\
  \ with enthusiasm to meet someone new. Their pressed uniforms are bright against\
  \ the dusty displays. I kneel down and answer their questions over and over again,\
  \ watching their smiles grow broader. \u2018Yes, I like Indonesia,\u2019 I say,\
  \ and they cheer."
