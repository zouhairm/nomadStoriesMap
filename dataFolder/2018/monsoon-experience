Text: "During my first day in Delhi I entered a Sikkim temple barefoot.\nThe route\
  \ was so dirty and the stairs so filthy that, that night, I fell asleep convinced\
  \ that I had caught some irreversible disease. The western narrow-mindedness was\
  \ still prevailing at that time.\n\nYesterday it rained all day.\nThis year the\
  \ monsoons are late, but the desired rain has finally arrived.\nThe poor are a little\
  \ less poor now.\nThis rain not only nourishes and refreshes but it\u2019s a real\
  \ blessing from the sky.\nManna of dry thirsty fields.\nIt\u2019s a wall of water\
  \ that seems impenetrable.\nBut if you abandon yourself to freedom, that\u2019s\
  \ when the risk becomes pleasure.\nYou can\u2019t hide, the rain doesn\u2019t absolve\
  \ you.\nI let it coddle me, I open my arms to new flavors.\nSimply cathartic.\n\
  I\u2019ve walked for 2 km under the protection of this watery thickness, my clothes\
  \ and hair dripping with freedom.\nThe Indian rain is much more intense and not\
  \ only because often you do not distinguish any shape in front of you.\nBut because\
  \ you feel part of it.\nYou don\u2019t need protection.\nYou can hide and take shelter\
  \ under a tin roof or an almost useless umbrella, or you can let yourself go and\
  \ taste the air.\nIt\u2019s a violent kiss that has been yearned for a long time.\n\
  After a couple of minutes, the novelty becomes a habit, the freshness turns into\
  \ shivers.\nIt doesn\u2019t matter, I\u2019ve reached my destination.\nThe Agra\
  \ Fort is a complex of palaces that dances in a perfect combination of red stone\
  \ and white marble, the same one of the Taj Mahal, and that conquers you for its\
  \ same perfection.\nDances, music and fountains are the background of this piece\
  \ of art mainly devoted to a joyful entertainment by sensual concubines.\nThe water\
  \ starts to flow heavily down the street.\nRivers of tears are soiled by trash.\n\
  My shoes absorb the water and become heavy, no dance is possible.\nI take them off.\n\
  I\u2019m not entering a temple nor a mosque, I\u2019m not following any social convention\
  \ except the one suggested by my heart.\nI simply feel this need for contact with\
  \ the earth, my bare feet are wetted by the monsoons in a still unknown dimension.\n\
  I gently wonder towards a new discovery.\nI sense Mother Earth, she\u2019s alive\
  \ and whispers her vibrations through the soles of my feet that are now free.\n\
  My collision with the origins begins.\nI feel the rough of the red stone, the extremely\
  \ dangerous smooth of marble.\nI explore this non-sacred place with my new senses.\n\
  When I get out, putting my shoes on is pure pain.\nI can\u2019t give up these new\
  \ sensations."
