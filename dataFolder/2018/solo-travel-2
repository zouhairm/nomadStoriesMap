Text: "A long time ago, in a continent far far away, I was travelling around Australia\
  \ with two friends when I decided to go my own way and take a sailing trip around\
  \ the Whitsunday Islands. It wasn\u2019t that we\u2019d fallen out, but one had\
  \ to work in Sydney and the other had a flight to catch, and I was determined not\
  \ to let their plans stop me from seeing everything the Gold Coast had to offer.\n\
  \nAnd so I signed up to the first catamaran cruise I could find and rocked up on\
  \ the morning of the tour with only a crate of beers for company. I figured this\
  \ would be the best way to make friends.\n\nEveryone on the boat, except me, was\
  \ with a group of buddies, and \u2013 not wanting to foist myself on anyone \u2013\
  \ I started the trip casually taking photos of the gorgeous turquoise seascapes,\
  \ rather than risk being labelled the weird hanger-on guy.\n\nAny external stimuli\
  \ was a great excuse to occupy myself, and seeing a lush island crop up behind us\
  \ I walked to the back of the boat to get my shot. If only there was something to\
  \ lean on I thought\u2026 and hey presto I spied a metal box with a lovely slanting\
  \ lid perfect for steadying my forearms on. Only the metal box was not a container:\
  \ it was a lit barbecue that had been heating up all morning, ready to cook lunch.Unfortunately\
  \ it wasn\u2019t a round of tasty kangaroo burgers that got burned, but the flesh\
  \ on my arms.\n\nScreaming in pain I (obviously) removed my arms immediately.\n\n\
  \u201CMy god that [email\_protected]#\u20ACing hurt!\u201D\n\nThe worst thing though\
  \ was that, to begin with at least, no marks appeared on my skin and no one took\
  \ me seriously when I said I was in a huge pain. The captain of the ship was reluctant\
  \ to use the limited water supply to allay the damage, and I didn\u2019t have any\
  \ friends even just to sympathise with me.\n\n\u201CIn short I sat on deck, suffering\
  \ in silence, trying not to cry.\u201D\n\nEventually my arms started to turn purple\
  \ and people started to take my injuries seriously at last.One girl, learning of\
  \ my wounds, offered me a special cream she had for burns. It turned out she was\
  \ from Beckenham\u2026 a small town in South London that just happens to be where\
  \ I was born What a co-incidence, to meet here, on a boat, pretty much in the exact\
  \ opposite corner of the world from where we both grew up. I\u2019m not sure what\
  \ I was pleased with \u2013 the medical treatment she offered me, or just the fact\
  \ that I now had a new friend and a shoulder to cry on!\n\nIn the end, after a bit\
  \ of treatment \u2013 and a few beers \u2013 the pain dulled enough that I was able\
  \ to enjoy the astonishing"
