Text: "BEAUTY IN CULTURE\nOur bus from Nairobi to Malindi leaves at 9.00pm and we\
  \ reach our destination at around 8.00 am. The heat is the first thing that you\
  \ first encounter before anything else. There is hot air everywhere and the only\
  \ places that are cool are areas next to the Ocean. The first place we go to is\
  \ Kibali Villas Resort, which will be the place that we\u2019ll be sleeping and\
  \ getting most of our meals from during our three day trip. The resort has the roofs\
  \ built from \u2018makuti\u2019. These are the leaves of the palm tree and they\
  \ are mostly used in Coastal areas because of the heat. \n We\u2019ll use a tuktuk\
  \ for our tour of Malindi. Tuktuks are the major means of public transport in Malindi.\
  \ It is a small three wheeled motor vehicle with plastic sheets on the sides and\
  \ the back acting as windows. Our tuktuk driver who will double up as our tour guide\
  \ is known as Kamal.\nThere is only one significant place in the Malindi tour because\
  \ of culture that we encounter. This is a local hotel that is known for the great\
  \ food it serves. Before entering the hotel, we have to cover ourselves with our\
  \ scarves because we are not decently dressed to sit down with the men in the room.\
  \ The Coastal region of Kenya is mostly populated by Muslims and they are therefore\
  \ conservative because of their religion. Entering the hotel, we realize that there\
  \ are no women eating there. So at first we stop to see if it is okay for us to\
  \ enter the premises and Kamal signals us to proceed and follow him. As we follow\
  \ behind, the beautiful smell that covers the hotel atmosphere triggers the need\
  \ to stop, close your eyes and take a deep breath. We sit down and order Chicken\
  \ Biryani which is a Coastal dish highly praised for its natural flavors. \nNow\
  \ the best part about the Coastal culture is how people dine together and they use\
  \ their hands while eating. The waiter brings us our food within 10 minutes of ordering\
  \ and he decides to bring us spoons as usual. Seeing everyone enjoying their different\
  \ dishes and all of them eating with their hands, we wash our hands put the spoons\
  \ aside and follow suit. One thing I can surely tell you, as compared to eating\
  \ using a spoon, eating with your hand makes the food even sweeter. I suppose that\
  \ is how the term \u2018finger-licking good\u2019 came about. The experience at\
  \ the hotel reminds me of how important it is to appreciate people\u2019s culture\
  \ and in doing so, the experience becomes far much greater."
