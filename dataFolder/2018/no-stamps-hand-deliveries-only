Text: "Have you heard of Ms Postie? No? No wonder! This adventurous character was\
  \ born on 11/11/17 and has been too shy to share with the world her great experience\
  \ with OZ hospitality. Time to change this. \n\nHow it all began.\nPoli looked for\
  \ a grand finale of her 2 months South American trip and headed in September to\
  \ Santa Cruz, Galapagos. She found her Beagle and started an 8 days yacht trip hopping\
  \ from 1 island to another, writing her own version of the origin of species: giant\
  \ tortoises, sea turtles (the EN language differentiates between terrestrial and\
  \ marine species), iguanas (no differentiation here although they are terrestrial\
  \ and marine), sea lions, all types of boobies (red-, blue-footed and nasca), fregate\
  \ birds, albatrosses, flamingos (not as many as in Laguna Colorada in Bolivia),\
  \ the  Gal\xE1pagos penguin, reef and hammerhead sharks, dolphins, manta and sting\
  \ rays....this local connection was so intense and addictive that snorkeling up\
  \ to 4 times a day in cold, open waters turned into her Galapagos Affair. \n\nOn\
  \ a cloudy morning, Poli reached the Post office bay on the Floreana Island and\
  \ bumped into a barrel full of postcards. This whaler system of communication from\
  \ the past had been turned into a touristic mail box. Nowadays, island visitors\
  \ leave postcards for their beloved ones with the hope that passengers from the\
  \ following ships will collect them and deliver them per hand if they live close\
  \ by. No stamps.\n\nFascinated by this unconventional way of meeting foreigners,\
  \ Poli thought that this is a unique opportunity to build a country travel itinerary\
  \ and took out 40 postcards for Australia out of the barrel. Hundreds of cards for\
  \ the rest of the world are still waiting their moment of glory. \n6 weeks later,\
  \ another cloudy Saturday afternoon, she knocked on the door of Zoe and Gary in\
  \ Palm beach, Australia, and turned into Ms Postie. The rest is history: 33 postcards\
  \ hand delivered across Queensland, Southern Australia, Victoria and New South Wales\
  \ by all kind of transportation and many miles of walking. She was lucky to meet\
  \ 26 times the recipients: from a 3 months old baby to grandparents in their late\
  \ 70s.\nAussies are cheerful and talkative mates. OMG! They are the modern times\
  \ explorers and Ms Postie captured their life and travelers  stories over coffee\
  \ and biscuits and many bottles of wine, accompanied by nibbles and dinners. Interested\
  \ to hear them? Next time...\n\nThe moral of the story: go find your way of travelling!"
