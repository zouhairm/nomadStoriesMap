Text: "Kate, unable to ignore the racket any more, rubbed her eyes, looked out of\
  \ the window, and went back to feigning sleep.\n\nOn deck, Ed took it all in. The\
  \ mighty Nile, shimmering under a pink sky. An old fisherman in a galabeya. A donkey\
  \ cart loaded with sugar cane. Dozens of pedlars on the quay, jostling and yelling,\
  \ and occasionally throwing up a towel, a sarong or a bag.\n\nA yellow sarong landed\
  \ at Ed\u2019s feet. Ed hadn\u2019t planned to buy one, but there he was, passing\
  \ five US dollars down. A present for Kate, so she could feel like she had been\
  \ on deck.\n\nEd knew that Kate had been awake but had chosen not to join him. The\
  \ heat and the flies, she told him. The sheets were dirty so she hadn\u2019t slept.\
  \ All those purple Germans. Just, you know, Ed, a bit tired. And now five dollars\
  \ blown on utter tat. Ed loved the cruise. He loved watching the fellahin at work,\
  \ the sunsets, and the temples. Kate was not as keen. It had made the honeymoon\
  \ tough for both of them, and it had been Ed\u2019s idea. Kate had fancied Aruba.\
  \ And now this bloody sarong. The afternoon passed slowly as Ed and Kate sat on\
  \ deck, pretending to read.\n\nThat night, Kate complained again that the sheets\
  \ were dirty. Ed replaced the sheet with the sarong. Kate slept like a lamb. She\
  \ wouldn\u2019t admit it in the morning, but Ed knew. Kate was in a better mood\
  \ when the boat docked at Luxor, where they were put on to a camel. On its way through\
  \ the city, the camel swerved to avoid a rusty old microbus, and Kate was flung\
  \ off, landing on her collarbone. Ed quickly fashioned a sling from the yellow sarong.\
  \ She didn\u2019t sleep as well that night, as the sarong wasn\u2019t available\
  \ as a sheet, but the pain got no worse, and Ed and Kate did fall asleep in one\
  \ another\u2019s arms.\n\nThe cruise ended.  Back in Cairo, a doctor fitted a proper\
  \ sling, and the sheets were clean. The yellow sarong was pressed into action again\
  \ as a hijab at the Citadel. On the last day, Kate even used it as a sarong. She\
  \ said that all her other clothes were dirty. Kate knew that Ed knew that was a\
  \ lie.  After dinner, they walked to the Khan-El-Khalili bazaar. Ed let her haggle\
  \ with a kindly old man over a rug. 50. 500. 100. 400. 150. 350. Kate didn\u2019\
  t want to go over 150. It would have meant going back to the cash machine, which\
  \ was not close by. OK, 150 and your lovely sarong, said the man.\n\n\u201CI\u2019\
  m sorry\u201D, said Kate. \u201CIt\u2019s worth more to me than you could possibly\
  \ know\u201D.\n\nEd allowed himself a smile as he left the bazaar, arm in arm with\
  \ the woman he loved."
