Text: "The story without an ending\nIt was the dawn of what promised to be a sunny\
  \ day but turned out to be dull on the surface. For a while here I was standing\
  \ on the Delft main road waiting to catch a taxi. Amid the waiting a silver grey\
  \ SATMA branded Toyota Yaris stops by.\n\u201CGreetings Gents!\u201D said the Driver\n\
  I replied, \u201CGood day Sir\u201D\n\u201CAren\u2019t you gents going to Stock\
  \ road? Because I am going that way as well.\u201D He said looking at us with a\
  \ smile on his face.\n\u201CYes, we are Sir\u201D\n\u201COkay, let me then give\
  \ you a hike\u201D he came out and packed our clothes on boot of his vehicle and\
  \ asked us to get inside the car, then drove off with us \u2013 Myself and Anathi,\
  \ a friend.\nIt was not long enough before the driver got stopped by a Taxi taking\
  \ the route, Delft to Nyanga which we were supposed to have taken had those who\
  \ passed us bothered to stop, and the one stopped us shown prior we were offered\
  \ the hike.\n\u201CEish, the taxi behind is asking me to pull over\u201D\nWe all\
  \ turned our heads and looked behind to see a Nyanga taxi flashing the lights to\
  \ our driver, who at the time was still driving forward. Our driver pulled out a\
  \ phone and started making calls to people he related to as they were taxi owners\
  \ neither colleagues and after dropping the phone he kept on reiterating that he\
  \ was a taxi owner as well, so he cannot be treated like that.\nAs we arrived at\
  \ the Delft South taxi rank which happens to be the biggest in the area we were\
  \ taken out to the long-distance office whereby we got about 4 taxi association\
  \ members who were all speaking and whom I think enjoyed listening to themselves\
  \ more than listening to our sides of the story. Our driver\u2019s words were minced,\
  \ and he was lambasted for violating the law to which I was not familiar to as a\
  \ passenger given the hike.\n \u201CWe are not going to listen to you, you the rules\
  \ not to steal people from our route. You\u2019re wrong and your fine is R 3 000,\
  \ or we are going to take your car.\u201D\nI looked at all of them annoyed by the\
  \ fact that I was delayed my journey, and because of that I may miss the bus, but\
  \ they were all shouting around and being bossy. At that moment I thought about\
  \ my belongings which they have looked to their position and then thought of going\
  \ to the Police Station with hope that they would help me claim my belongings.\n\
  I rushed to fetch the police, so they could help me recover my belongings, to my\
  \ surprise that never succeeded. I ended up compromising my journey to save the\
  \ Yaris owner from a fine and dumping my plan was \u201CThe last thing I expected\u201D"
