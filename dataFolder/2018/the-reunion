Text: "The visit to Bodmin Moor was a lot more mysterious than the famous Hurling\
  \ Stones themselves we found out. Walking on the moors is like dodging craters on\
  \ the moon.\n\nWho doesn\u2019t want to touch lichen stained stones that have stood\
  \ for centuries absorbing energies from real demises, romances and ghostly beings?\
  \  \nTucked into the crutch of Minions you will find Bodmin Moor in the northeast\
  \ of Cornwall. Once known for its granite mining, it is now a world heritage site.\
  \  \n\nExcitement tugged me from all sides as I tread carefully across rugged and\
  \ desolate grassland. I pressed my palms against those ancient stones and listened.\
  \ I had captured a distress signal. It sounded like a whisper through time, could\
  \ it be, but no it was coming from further afar, being carried on the breeze.\n\n\
  We hurried, there were two voices. We rushed over tors and rounded ditches and barrows,\
  \ dry clumps of grass and yellow Gorse bushes in the direction of the stone engine\
  \ house which exhibits the surrounding history and soars towards the wispy white\
  \ and blue sky.\n\nA sheep with red branding her base chakra pranced back and forth\
  \ above a giant hollow, her bleating scented with fear.  Our eyes circled the area\
  \ like torches, the echo becoming more intriguing.  The ewe ran down the dip and\
  \ back trying desperately to catch our attention. There appeared to be nothing there\
  \ but still we hear the cries in answer. \n\nClearly she is a mother and her dancing\
  \ becomes more desperate. I spot a small hole and crouch into the ditch and peer\
  \ inside. A black lamb is stuck deep within. It becomes clear that the hole tunnels\
  \ deeper into the earth and my concern escalates as I push in my hand, that the\
  \ lamb will tumble further and I won\u2019t be able to reach her.\n\nMy heart races\
  \ as I try pulling the woolly babe from what looks like a rabbit burrow. I tug and\
  \ pull and clasp. Slowly I begin freeing her from Bodmin\u2019s earthy clutches.\
  \ Finally I\u2019m embracing a local, my nostrils reeling in a blend of lanolin\
  \ and soil. \n\n\u201COh I have saved you from premature death.\u201D\n\nI step\
  \ up and set her down on unsteady legs. Her mother expectantly waits for the reunion\
  \ with her precious child as she wobbles her way.\nMaternal kisses and hugs prove\
  \ their loving bond and as baby suckles and replenishes on her teat, parental eyes\
  \ radiate gratitude upon us with sweet satisfaction upon her face."
