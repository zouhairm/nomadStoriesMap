Text: "I wasn\u2019t quite sure what I was looking for at the time, but I knew I needed\
  \ to look for it in a place that was far from everything I knew. So I got on a plane\
  \ from NYC to Cuba. The reactions I received when I told people from the U.S. about\
  \ my upcoming plans were not warm ones. The flight was basically the same distance\
  \ and time if I were to fly to Miami, but I knew when I got off the plane it was\
  \ going to be like landing in a distant world. For my shortest international trip,\
  \ Cuba taught me so many things about the world and about people.\n\nAfter a day\
  \ of wandering and salsa dancing the night away, I had a walking tour from a local.\
  \ It was one on one, taking me around Old and Central Havana. The smells of spices\
  \ and roasting meat filled the afternoon air under the hot Cuban sun. The history\
  \ of Old Havana was very humbling because of how little I knew about a place that\
  \ is so close to my native country, that I never learned about. When we ventured\
  \ to Central Havana (which is directly across a boulevard from Old Havana), I got\
  \ a real look at where and how people live, without a front for the tourists, where\
  \ the real culture of the Cuban people resides.\n\nMy tour guide answered the hundreds\
  \ of questions I had in a raw way. The time I spent in Central Havana with a local\
  \ learning about this communist country that has been stuck in time, which the United\
  \ States had been feuding with for years chewed up my previous perceptions and spit\
  \ them out. Cuba is doing what every other country on this planet is doing; living\
  \ the way they know, by the way their government thinks is right.\n\nGoing to Cuba,\
  \ I didn\u2019t think Communists were \u201Cbad\u201D people, but I didn\u2019t\
  \ necessarily have a positive perspective either. Cuba made me internalize my views\
  \ of the world, and people of the world. Broadly speaking, I realized the people\
  \ of countries I perceived as not-nice places to be aren\u2019t bad. They are simply\
  \ living the way they know, under a government that thinks they are governing the\
  \ right way.\n\nWe are all people, and though we aren\u2019t the same, we aren\u2019\
  t that different, either. Like the rest of us, Cubans are living to survive, to\
  \ live their lives, to love, to do what makes them happy. The way governments govern,\
  \ and the way they interact with each other does not define their people. To understand\
  \ people, you\u2019ve got to understand their country and see how they live. When\
  \ I saw the way Cubans live, I came to discover they are some of the happiest, kindest\
  \ people I\u2019ve ever met."
