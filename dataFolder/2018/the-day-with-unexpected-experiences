Text: "We are human beings. There are two things  which I liked most and never be\
  \ compromised with. Of course travel, foods and lots of writing. So last year I\
  \ was in West Bengal. Usually it's a native state out of several stated of United\
  \ India \"Bharat\". I don't know , why always it's become very difficult to figure\
  \ out the running situations for me it's was a travel to an another world. So travel,\
  \ what are the factorscompromises with travel ?? I don't know about different views\
  \ of different travellers. But for me it's my life. We were 7, in a forest it's\
  \ deep as even growth formed to be a profound meaning of life. Suddenly we are shocked\
  \ by an vocabulous marmaric sound comes out from the right side end of my backyard.\
  \ I can't express in words that how was it been. It's was an wounded leopard. Sharp\
  \ shot on throat , legs and semi abdomen. We were vigorously surprised with the\
  \ beauty of an beings fighting in-between life and death. Suddenly we were rescued\
  \ by local people and forest guards. And we helped them to arrest theater poachers\
  \ community. \nIn this way it is proved that , it is essential to  be a verbal communication\
  \ between local community of visiting area."
