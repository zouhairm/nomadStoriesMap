Text: "Our family was last seen tripping in Cuba. My husband, three kids (ages 15-25)\
  \ and I love adventures and that\u2019s what we got. \n\nAt Havana\u2019s Jos\xE9\
  \ Mart\xED International Airport we made a beeline to the car rental counter to\
  \ fetch our nine-seater van. Why such a big car? Hitchhikers of course\u2014we fully\
  \ intended to rely on the \"kindness of strangers\" to help navigate the island...and\
  \ it worked. In just 12 days we gave 44 Cubans a lift. \n\nCuba has much to offer,\
  \ but getting around is no easy task. The picturesque Playa Pilar shore and hilly\
  \ Vi\xF1ales landscapes are an artist\u2019s dream. Add the colorful cityscapes,\
  \ vibrant art, and pulsating music prevalent from Havana to Santiago de Cuba and\
  \ you\u2019ve got an intoxicating case of sensory overload. While vintage cars and\
  \ eclectic architecture give Cuba the land-time-forgot feel, its spotty Internet/cell/GPS\
  \ services confirm it. Combine limited technology with sporadic road signs and rudimentary\
  \ maps to fully appreciate our self-navigation driving dilemma. \n\nCue in the hitchhikers.\
  \ They got free lifts with air-conditioning, waters, and granola bars; in exchange,\
  \ they helped us find our casa particulares (homestays). We loved hearing their\
  \ stories about Cuban life and practicing Spanish with them. Very edu-taining indeed.\
  \ \n\nJair rode nearly 300 kilometers to Trinidad with us. He hopped in when we\
  \ picked up a family outside Havana. Once there, he made finding our casa particular\
  \ his mission by quizzing locals until he found it. \n\nWhile the hitchhikers linked\
  \ us from town-to-town, Jair connected us to an elderly man named Luis. He lived\
  \ near our lodging, close to Plaza Mayor. Like many Cubans, Luis stood behind his\
  \ iron screen door watching life on the cobblestones. Most scrutinized us, but he\
  \ engaged us every time we passed\u2026and it was fun. We wanted a keepsake, so\
  \ we asked for a photo with him. What followed was unexpected. Luis opened his door\
  \ ushering us in. His home was a shanty with two shrines; one for health and another\
  \ for family. He put on a hat for the picture and grabbed a chair for me, posing\
  \ everyone around it. After, Luis gave us each a sacred stone from his wellness\
  \ shrine\u2026our Cuban talismans. \n\nLuis was intent on showing us his toy plane.\
  \ He flew it around the room, using it as a prop to punctuate his words. We were\
  \ puzzled at first, but when the plane nosedived and he said \u201Ceso no\u201D\
  \ (not that), epiphany struck. He was wishing us a safe journey home. \n\nWe still\
  \ have our rock charms. Each a connection to Cuba and charming Luis."
