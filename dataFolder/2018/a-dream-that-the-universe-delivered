Text: "'Making a local connection'\nIt was part of my dreams, which is why I always\
  \ knew that since I had already told the universe about it, in near future it was\
  \ going to happen. Cape Town, The Mother city, one of many people dream holiday\
  \ destination. Yeah it was all that was on my mind since the first time I had about\
  \ it wonders in High school. Besides I was just a village girl from one of the provinces\
  \ in South Africa, called Kwa-Zulu Natal never have been outside of Kwa-Zulu Natal\
  \ before. So you can imagine how difficult it was for me to still hold on to my\
  \ dream and still believe that one day it would come true.\nIt was on the 23 of\
  \ January 2017 when I was busy doing laundry outside my apartment when I received\
  \ a notification on my phone and when I attended, it was an email from Cape Peninsula\
  \ University of Technology (CPUT) which was to inform me that I was accepted to\
  \ study there. In case you are wondering where that was it was one of the universities\
  \ in the Mother city.\nFew days there were all like a dream I couldn\u2019t believe\
  \ it had come true, after all not this soon. Weeks passed and every day I would\
  \ write everything that I had saw for the first time there. One afternoon I was\
  \ in a bus from Campus. A tall confident lady came in with a smile and sat just\
  \ right next to me. As the driver started the engine and started driving away, the\
  \ lady started the conversation with me. We were having the conversation for the\
  \ first time but it really felt like we have known each other for a long time. To\
  \ keep it short we just clicked right there in the spot. I wanted to know the person\
  \ more. But well the trip was very short and I didn\u2019t want that to be my last\
  \ conversation with her. We exchanged contacts and that was how we became friends.\
  \ The following day when we met we started planning how we were going to enjoy our\
  \ weekend, of which it was a good thing because I desperately wanted to find someone\
  \ whom I was going to explore the city with and spend my spare time with, when I\
  \ am not that busy to go out. And to my surprise the person knew a lot about the\
  \ mother city he showed me around and even recommended places that were even more\
  \ suitable for me to even take photographs of the city and write about for my blog,\
  \ I enjoyed the place. I would wake up in the morning and start postulating about\
  \ my weekend and how I was going to make time. So that I would go out with her or\
  \ by myself if she was busy. She made it very easy for me to enjoy my dream and\
  \ also to explore the city."
