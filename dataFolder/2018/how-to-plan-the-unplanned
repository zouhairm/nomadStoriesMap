Text: "\u201CTo get the best experience, plan well\". I always had a plan for everything.\
  \ I am not a traveler, but I do travel places, as and when I am able to. I have\
  \ travelled mostly India (southern India, extensively). So when we both got a chance\
  \ to visit Punjab, I had butterflies in my stomach. Anyone who has spent entire\
  \ 25+ years in southern India will know what the statement means. I have never worn\
  \ sweater or own a sweater. I started dreaming about trip. Started with booking\
  \ flights, hotels, and got stuck up in Iternary. There were so many places to see\
  \ and so little time. So finally the day came when I boarded the flight to Amritsar,\
  \ Punjab. I do not remember the flight ride because I felt like I was in trance.\
  \ I was unable to stop smiling entire time. So we landed in Amritsar Airport by\
  \ 1 pm, and the 1st thing I felt was shivering, as it was so cold. Though I had\
  \ Jackets, it was not a sweater. For the 1st time in my life, I realized difference\
  \ between Jacket and a Sweater. I visited  most iconic place of Amritsar is \"Harmandir\
  \ Sahib\"(Golden Temple). It is impossible to visit Punjab and not visit this place.\
  \ The temple looks beautiful with the golden exterior shining in the morning sun.\
  \ I was suggested by driver to have 'Langar' in Harmandir Sahib. Langar is the largest\
  \ community run free kitchen which provides free food for thousands of pilgrims\
  \ every day. This is documented by various media. Though I knew about it, I had\
  \ completely forgotten about the same. When he reminded me, I could not be more\
  \ happy and thankful to him. The Langar experience was the most cherished and humbling\
  \ to sit with everyone, have the same food as everyone, which reminds us to respect\
  \ all. I was shocked to see the number of volunteers who work continuously to cook\
  \ food, to clean the plates, to serve the food. Their dedication deserved the salute.\
  \  After having the food, when I came out of the hall, I was just struck with the\
  \ beauty of the Golden temple, shining in the night light. The morning view was\
  \ unforgettable, but seeing the night view we were at loss of words. I could not\
  \ see more places, but it helped me learn that it is not necessary to see more places,\
  \ it is necessary to find happiness in the places we visit. I found lot of happiness\
  \ in both places and people. \u201CTravel makes one modest. You see what a tiny\
  \ place you occupy in the world\u201D. Who knew that one day will feel the same\
  \ but the need to control though present somewhere within, will get subdue a lot."
