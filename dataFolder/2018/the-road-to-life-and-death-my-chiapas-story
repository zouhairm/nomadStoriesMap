Text: "I must preface that the \"road\" that I traveled was undoubtedly a trail, an\
  \ off beaten, incline path engulfed by mud and tall grass which lay on the side\
  \ of a mountain located in Acteal, Chiapas, Mexico. It intertwined through the coffee\
  \ plants that produced the beans from which I had been purchasing for my project\
  \ back home. This foot path has become permanently ingrained in my mind and is likewise\
  \ perpetually trekked by the indigenous coffee growers that work this harsh terrain.\
  \ The trail led to their only water source, a well that was not retaining. Being\
  \ led by the head of the coffee coop, it took me a half day to reach this lifeless\
  \ spirit in the mountain, a pilgrimaged endured by the women and children of the\
  \ village every day. \nI was there to observe the well and document my findings.\
  \ \n\nI anticipated that this trip would change my life, alter my perspective on\
  \ the world and what it meant to be hardworking, compassionate, sympathetic, and\
  \ empathetic. I understood this journey would implore me to relinquish my propensity\
  \ for material things, yet the last thing I expected was to find Agape love in the\
  \ mountains.\n\nI was freezing; the rain pounded, and I was covered in mud from\
  \ my knees down. After documenting my findings, my guide led me to his home where\
  \ I met his family and his neighbors. This is where I received an unconditional\
  \ love greater than that of the people I know. I couldn't ease their pain or suffering.\
  \ I could not prevent the spread of roya del caf\xE9, the disease decimating their\
  \ primary income source. Yet, they embraced my unrecognizable face with warmth and\
  \ affection. Our contagious laughter and joy echoed, inviting more people of the\
  \ village to our gathering. \n\nI use \"Agape love\" to communicate my truth but\
  \ also to honor the sanctity and virtue bestowed upon these people of the Chiapas\
  \ highlands.\n\nLater that evening, I found myself in the center of the Acteal village.\
  \ Prior, I knew very little of the Acteal Massacre of December 22, 1997. On this\
  \ day, the soldiers of the revolutionary party descended the mountain and murdered\
  \ the Las Abejas (the Bees), a pacifist group of 45 innocent women and children\
  \ who advocated for the Zapatista rebels. \n\nI stepped foot into the church where\
  \ the women and children were praying to God when the shots fired. I peered through\
  \ the cavities left by the bullet holes that pierced through the concrete, shivering\
  \ during what is the most surreal moment of my life."
