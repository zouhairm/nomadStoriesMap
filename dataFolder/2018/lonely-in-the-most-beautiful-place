Text: "One day I decided to visit Cinque Terre, this place used to be visit by friends\
  \ or lovers at least that was my impression.  One of those times I felt completely\
  \ alone, and I am used to, but I don\xB4t know, I guess that place reminded me many\
  \ things, that was probably the most romantic and beautiful place I\xB4ve ever seen.\
  \ There I met this Australian girl Lizie in the hostel were we did a volunteer and\
  \ it was just us, we made a party the first day and we met many people. \nThat morning\
  \ I climbed to the top, I was drawing when this Italian boy came to me. I told him\
  \ that I don\xB4t speak Italian, he said that he just want to watch, off course\
  \ he translate every word to English. He didn\xB4t speak English or Spanish my native\
  \ language but he tried so hard it was adorable. He said you need to see the best\
  \ places in Cinque Terre and I\xB4ll take you there. I just said yes, and he showed\
  \ me those places that people don\xB4t used to visit and it was wonderful.\"You\
  \ won\xB4t learn more about a places if you don\xB4t try to understand the culture\"\
  \ We walk to another beach with only rocks many sizes and really hot, a painful\
  \ way just to stay in a calm and lonely place, my feet were killing me because we\
  \ had to take our shoes off. I don\xB4t like to complain so we started walking until\
  \ we get to there. I told him I just wanted to relax and enjoy into shadows, the\
  \ sound of the waves, the whispering of the wind what else can you ask for. The\
  \ next day I was with Lizie in Manarola, and we decided to take the Via dell\xB4\
  \ amore, It was a path that leads from Manarola to Riomaggiore, we saw a door but\
  \ it was closed, we were no supposed to cross but we did. It is not a good idea\
  \ trust me, I don\xB4t recommend anyone to do this. The view was incredible, suddenly\
  \ it was mostly destroyed and some rocks start falling, but we were not coming back,\
  \ we check every step taking care not to fall into the deepness. I felt in danger\
  \ but I never saw so splendid place preceded to destruction. The sun was hidden\
  \ when we saw the end so close to the abyss, I was thinking if I slipped from this\
  \ railing I will probably die. We didn\xB4t have other choice, my heart started\
  \ beating so fast, we had to be brave, I stopped thinking and we did. \nThat night\
  \ the Italian boy showed up, I told him I was leaving. My travel was not over and\
  \ who knows what\xB4s going to happen, I take any good thing that life can give\
  \ me, about bad things I avoid them or let them happen then I keep moving, It won\xB4\
  t be perfect but eventually you\xB4ll feel good."
