Text: "\u201CIn San Pedro, there are no flowers at your funeral.\u201D\nMy host Carolina\
  \ ushers me into her workspace, which houses everything from invoices to pool noodles.\n\
  \u201CA bride wont hold a fresh bouquet at her wedding. Nothing like that grows\
  \ round here.\u201D\nIt\u2019s an odd aspect of desert life. For many grass is everyday,\
  \ flowers bloom year round and buying them is a quick supermarket trip. But in San\
  \ Pedro de Atacama, a small outpost in the middle of the world\u2019s highest and\
  \ driest desert, flowers are a foreign concept.\n\u201CSeeing as nature can't provide,\
  \ we have to make them instead.\" She squeezes past an old sofa, chatting as she\
  \ rummages. \"There's an old woman in town who hand-makes these for all our events.\u201D\
  \nShe returns and gives me a crepe paper peony from a hidden bouquet in the back\
  \ - a brightly-coloured crafting feat of wire and glue. It\u2019s impossibly pink\
  \ and you can still see the echo of old fingers in the twist of its long green stem.\
  \ She hands me another, this time a light blue chrysanthemum. \n\u201CThese are\
  \ a gift. A thank you for coming to see San Pedro and Chile, from one hiker to another.\u201D\
  \nJust when I'd thought Chileans couldn't be any kinder or more welcoming, I met\
  \ Carolina. Before hosting, she'd been a trekking tour guide across Chile, courteously\
  \ living and hiking in all the places I'm visiting. She's a go-to guide for the\
  \ Atacama, Patagonia and even remote Rapa Nui and she\u2019s shown me some incredible\
  \ under-the-radar walks and ways of seeing her country. \nWhen we first spoke I\
  \ merely asked the direction of Valle de la Luna. Forty minutes later I left invigorated\
  \ by association, with two full sides of A4 plans. Since then my bright, beautiful\
  \ desert mornings have been spent sitting with Carolina, listening to a torrent\
  \ of tales and tips in the spreading sunshine over - admittedly abysmal - coffee.\
  \ With wild arms and huge grin she's spewed forth all her local's knowledge, from\
  \ where to find a waterfall in the arid Atacama to the best place to buy cheap,\
  \ authentic local art in Easter Island (the prison, of course). Our breakfasts weren't\
  \ enough to contain Carolina's knowledge or enthusiasm - she regularly cornered\
  \ me in the bathroom, kitchen and on the drive with an extra, vital tidbit. \nI\
  \ can't thank her enough for both her guidance and this new gift but she brushes\
  \ it off.\n\"De nada. I just really want you to love my country.\"\nI easily tell\
  \ her that just four days in I'm smitten with her strange, slim land of desert and\
  \ drama, genuine smiles and fine fake flowers."
