Text: "It was the day after my graduation ceremony, and I was fretting as to what\
  \ I was now going to do with my life with a BA in International Relations. Nevertheless,\
  \ with the send of a message to an out-of-country connection and an interview that\
  \ same afternoon, it was decided by 3 pm that I was going to Quito, Ecuador for\
  \ 2.5 months. I had just short of 48 hours to prepare, pack and board my plane.\
  \ The whole situation was surreal because I had a feeling that I would not be in\
  \ Vancouver for the summer, even though I had no set plans to be leaving before\
  \ this. The whole concept of \u201Ceverything happens for a reason\u201C, as cliche\
  \ as it may sound to some, has always resonated with me. South America had been\
  \ on my ever-growing list of places to go for a while, and this was the perfect\
  \ opportunity to travel.\nI still think about that trip and about returning to South\
  \ America daily. Those 2.5 months changed my life. It changed my life by changing\
  \ my outlook. Something about being in that part of the world snapped my mind back\
  \ into place. I no longer worried about such minuscule things, but rather I focused\
  \ on happiness, positive energy and looking at the good side of things. I haven\u2019\
  t looked back since.\nLiving in Ecuador, I went to a new city almost every second\
  \ week. Exploring Quito from North to South and top to bottom. Ba\xF1os, Mindo,\
  \ Cuenca and of course my favourite part of the trip, the Quilotoa Loop.\nEach city\
  \ provided me with new people to meet, food to try and culture to explore. When\
  \ I try and pinpoint what it was that changed my outlook and perspective, my mind\
  \ immediately shifts to the people and the location. I met such genuine and happy\
  \ people in every city, town and caf\xE9. The vibe is laid back and I was constantly\
  \ surrounded by vast mountains and beautiful views that were unlike the ones I was\
  \ used to back home. It was also the Spanish, the culture, the vibrant Latin vibes\
  \ and music. It was a change of scenery and I honestly dreaded leaving, which has\
  \ never happened to me before this trip.\nThe day I left for the airport I got the\
  \ saying \u201Cama la vida\u201D \u2013 love life- tattooed on my arm. The slogan\
  \ for Ecuador\u2019s tourism industry, and the reignited love I found for life in\
  \ this country has so much meaning for me, and always will. The country that I re-discovered\
  \ the passion and desire I have for traveling, meeting new people and discovering\
  \ the beauty in all the places around us, from mountain tops to big cities and everything\
  \ in between."
