Text: "The wind and dust are horrendous, visibility nil.  I am in Jordan travelling\
  \ on an overlander truck with fresh air windows. Earlier in the day, we resorted\
  \ to tying down the light shutters which eliminated a little dust and all the hazy\
  \ view.\nOur driver, hoping to camp on top of a hill, hesitated before making a\
  \ final decision. \n\u201CBelieve me it will be ok,\u201D he grinned as we stared\
  \ in disbelief. \u201CThe wind will vanish once darkness falls.\u201D\nAm I na\xEF\
  ve? Is this what young folk call excitement? \nI have not the foggiest idea about\
  \ pitching a tent but George our driver, senses my unease.\n\u201CAs it is your\
  \ first night Esther, I will help you.\u201D \nRelief is overwhelming. \nTo my eyes,\
  \ the exposed hillside camp on the bare stony ground looks far from perfect. Hampered\
  \ by the wind, pitching a tent is no easy task so I give George and the process\
  \ my full attention. With the last peg in place, the tent is sitting pretty. I am\
  \ amazed that darkness is falling and the wind has vanished! \nI stand and gaze\
  \ around noticing twinkling lights far below.\n\u201CGeorge,\u201D I say, \u201C\
  what are those lights below?\u201D\n\u201CWell,\u201D says George, in a slow drawl,\
  \ \u201CThat straight row of lights is the border.\u201D\nWhat border? I wonder.\
  \ \n\u201CThe town is Jericho.\u201D\nI let out a funny squeal of incredulity. \u201C\
  Jericho!\u201D I repeated.\nGeorge continues. \u201CThat next group of lights is\
  \ Bethlehem.\u201D\nBethlehem!\u201D Parrot-like I repeat in another high-pitched\
  \ squeak.\nStill more. \u201CThe lights on the hill beyond is Jerusalem.\u201D\n\
  By now I am overcome with emotion. Jerusalem comes out in an unrecognisable gasp.\
  \ I had no idea I would be able to see the Holy Cities from our camp spot on the\
  \ hills above the Dead Sea.\nI walk in a daze with George to join the group for\
  \ a barbecue meal. It is surreal. I, a nobody like me, am sitting on the hills above\
  \ Bethlehem. \nIt is of little significance to the rest of the group but I am overcome.\
  \ As soon as possible I make my excuses, escaping to the quietness of the night\
  \ where I sit alone on the hillside gazing in awe and wonder.\nUnbelievable. The\
  \ air after the hazy day is crystal clear. The sparkling lights below match the\
  \ starry sky above as quietly I sing, \u201COh, little town of Bethlehem, how still\
  \ we see thee lie.\u201D \nA breath-taking lump rises in my throat, threatening\
  \ to choke, while the odd tear of joy trickles down my cheeks. In my isolated cocoon\
  \ of quietness, I am in another land, on another hillside, at another time. I hear\
  \ a host of heavenly angels singing \u201CGlory to God in the Highest. Peace on\
  \ earth and goodwill to men.\u201D"
