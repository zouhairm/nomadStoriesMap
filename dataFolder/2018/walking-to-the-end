Text: "Walking the Cinque Terre in one day is no small feat. I mean, almost 25 miles,\
  \ spread through 5 towns, in one day? Not the smartest decision I\u2019ve made.\
  \ And that\u2019s not even walking on flat ground. You hike up into the mountains;\
  \ using stone steps built into the side that are so old you\u2019re both captivated\
  \ by their rusticness and terrified they will crumble beneath your feet at the same\
  \ time. After hiking on what felt like an extreme Stairmaster the entire day, I\
  \ honestly didn\u2019t know if my legs would function long enough to get back to\
  \ our hostel. Of course, I was able to drag myself to the nearest restaurant and\
  \ get the best tasting pasta of my life (although to be completely honest I could\
  \ have eaten a stale piece of bread and been perfectly content).        \nBut I\
  \ wouldn\u2019t have done it any different.\nWaking up at 6 am to start our hike\
  \ and finishing at 7 pm meant we got to see both the sunrise and sunset while walking\
  \ along the coast. Yes, you read that correctly. That\u2019s 13 hours of hiking.\
  \ 13 hours. 13. And all I have to show for it is a few souvenirs picked up along\
  \ the way and some very sweaty-looking pictures. What I can\u2019t show are my memories.\
  \ Eating gelato along the coast, getting lost, looking at the towns from above,\
  \ falling down, it all happened along our trek. \nMost of the path was a thin, worn\
  \ down patch of dirt surrounded by incredibly vibrant green trees and the Mediterranean\
  \ Sea. The trees seemed to hit you in the face no matter what side of the path you\
  \ walked on, but the Mediterranean was such a large expanse of water it made you\
  \ feel infinite. We would just stop on the path and look around us. We wouldn\u2019\
  t even take a picture. We just wanted to take in the view. Have you ever just stopped\
  \ and taken a second out of your day to breath? It\u2019s invigorating yet calming\
  \ at the same time.\nBut that calm feeling was not continuous throughout the hike.\
  \ Every trip has its ups and downs. Remember how I mentioned getting lost? That\
  \ happened. Twice. Yes, there are trail markers and yes, we managed to lose them.\
  \ While that lead to some laughs, most of that time was spent in contempt of one\
  \ another, resulting from our complete exhaustion and our embarrassment that we\
  \ lost a huge, very noticeable, trail. \nI return my original statement: walking\
  \ the Cinque Terre in one day is no small feat. By the end my legs were jello, my\
  \ feet were stubs, my stomach was growling like a monster and my physical limit\
  \ had been found. And I wouldn\u2019t give it up for anything."
