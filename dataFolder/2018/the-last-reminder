Text: "In the last years, she had become a fragile creature. Every time I visited\
  \ her, she was sitting in her rocking chair, staring at the window with a lost look.\
  \ As if she was waiting for something. Sometimes, she would close her eyes for a\
  \ while and curve her lips into a smile. I could feel how she disappeared. It felt\
  \ like her soul flew away to a beautiful place. Like she used to say, \u201Cyour\
  \ imagination can always make you travel\u201D. \n\nOne of those days, I was so\
  \ tired I fell asleep on the couch next to her. By the time I opened my eyes, the\
  \ sun had set, and the darkness filled the room around us. I was about to get up\
  \ to light the lamp when, right at that moment, something magical happened. \n\n\
  Her eyes were still closed but she began humming some strange sounds and words,\
  \ in a language I didn't know. She laughed and started singing a cheerful melody\
  \ accompanied by a slow sway. As if suddenly she was a young woman dancing with\
  \ old friends. Her face looked youthful. And I was just amazed watching her, although\
  \ I couldn\u2019t understand what she was saying. I realized after a few times,\
  \ that she kept saying one word in the loop. I tried to understand it, but then\
  \ she stopped.\n\nI knew she could still remember, so I kept visiting her, day after\
  \ day. I tried to fulfil her ritual in secret, waiting for the sun to disappear\
  \ over the horizon and staying in the room just the two of us, in complete darkness.\
  \ But she never spoke again. \n\nOne night I had a vivid dream. It was a winter\
  \ afternoon, we were together in the living room, having some hot chocolate she\
  \ had prepared. I had occupied the table with my color markers and was complaining\
  \ about not knowing how to draw a natural landscape. She took an old travel notebook\
  \ and while she showed me hundreds of pages with sketches of wildflowers, elephants,\
  \ and smiling people, she told me a story about a little girl with big dreams. \n\
  \nThis girl grew up in a huge city where there were no wild areas, but shiny buildings.\
  \ However, one day she decided to take a trip without a return ticket to South Africa.\
  \ She was afraid, but her craving for adventure made her stronger than anyone expected.\
  \ She discovered a whole new world. Surrounded by mountains, people of a different\
  \ race and culture, for the first time, she knew she didn't need to imagine anymore.\
  \ She felt alive.\n\nThe next morning her voice woke me up, whispering a word as\
  \ a goodbye. \"Ubuntu\", she said happily. She had left me her last lesson: be human,\
  \ be kind, be yourself."
