Text: "If Sydney is the rising sun of New South Wales in Australia then Port Stephens\
  \ is the alluring silhouette of\_ the clouds at the moment of sunset located in\
  \ Hunter region of NSW. This travel gift on my birthday from my husband was a surprise.\
  \ The journey was embraced through\_ train ride from Sydney Central station to Newcastle\
  \ along with one hour bus journey to Nelson bay allowing me to amaze myself from\
  \ picturesque of the houses over the coastline and the turquoise blue sea.\n\nThe\
  \ Ibis hotel was on the shores of Salamander bay for which we took another bus ride\
  \ from Nelson bay. Till this point of time I was going with the flow without expecting\
  \ any further awe moment, then I had sudden urge of sea view room for which we requested\
  \ even and refused by the hotel staff. But as we entered in the balcony of our room\
  \ the view was awestruck with beach, sea, greenery of Tomaree Head and welcome wine\
  \ on the table. Next day we were told about complimentary breakfast which was mentioned\
  \ in our tickets about which I wasn't imbued by my husband and we packed our stomach\
  \ to make ourselves ready for Snorkeling ; another surprise by him.\n\nWhat will\
  \ happen to me when I will be under water for the very first time, was the question\
  \ storming my brain upside down, but somehow I made up my mind and strengthened\
  \ my heart to go for it. When I entered in water with instructor I couldn't breathe\
  \ properly, panicked but slowly and steadily I became comfortable and to my surprise\
  \ I spend fifty minutes underwater along holding a pink jelly fish in my hand and\
  \ watching corals.After this small achievement, whale watching cruise was waiting\
  \ for us as a reward at coast of Nelson bay.\n\nWhen we came back to hotel I laid\
  \ down and lost in another world without thinking of big day. In the midnight suddenly\
  \ my husband woke me up to see a room full of balloons, illuminated candles, cake\
  \ and getting enlightened with soft music.\n\n\u201DHappy Birthday honey\",he wished\
  \ me with a hug.\n\nAfter going back to Sydney, enthralled by all the stupendous\
  \ efforts made by my husband for this travel gift especially hotel stay,I asked\_\
  \ him you would have spend at least a grand in hotel stay for all the facilities\
  \ we availed which wasn't required, to which what he politely replied had ringed\
  \ hard in my ear drums ,\n\n\u201CNo, it was just 350$ in total\u201D."
