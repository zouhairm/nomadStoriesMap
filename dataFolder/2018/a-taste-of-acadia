Text: "The most important Chiac phrase you\u2019ll learn in New Brunswick is coques-frites:\
  \ fried clams. The fry cook at Chez L\xE9o shook sea salt over mine and topped them\
  \ with a wedge of lemon, then slid me the parcel. The coques-frites were hot, crisp,\
  \ and briny. I returned to the order window.\n\u201CLobster roll, s\u2019il vous\
  \ plait.\u201D\nYes, \u201Ccoques-frites\u201D is right. \u201CLobster roll\u201D\
  \ is too. That\u2019s Chiac: a dialect that is part Old World French and part modern\
  \ anglophone Canada, with a sprinkle of influence from the Mi\u2019kmaq, who are\
  \ indigenous to this part of New Brunswick. It\u2019s responsible for such glorious\
  \ sentences as \u201CC\u2019est tough de driver stick\u201D (It\u2019s tough to\
  \ drive stick) and \u201CCheck \xE7a out, call-moi back\u201D (Check it out, call\
  \ me back). Until I drove 7500 kms from my home in Vancouver, BC to Shediac, NB\
  \ (mostly thinking of fried clams and cheap lobster) I didn\u2019t know it existed.\n\
  It was late fall and the forest was ablaze with colour. Yellow birch leaves looked\
  \ radioactive against hot pink sugar maples. My host was Michel, an Acadian \u30FC\
  \ a descendant of French settlers in New Brunswick \u30FC from thirteen generations\
  \ back. He took me to La Dune de Bouctouche, a 12 km stretch of sands that reach\
  \ into the bay and shapeshift with the wind and tides. We strolled the boardwalk.\
  \ \n\u201CMy mother was a teacher in this entirely francophone community in a province\
  \ with an anglophone government. She translated textbooks, she made copies by hand\
  \ for each of her students.\u201D\nAcadian people have held on to their language\
  \ despite many attempts at forced assimilation, first by the British and later the\
  \ Canadian governments. Michel\u2019s family is one of few that remained after a\
  \ mass deportation carried out by British forces in 1755. Families were split up\
  \ relocated to southern colonies at random. Many members of this diaspora have returned\
  \ to New Brunswick, maybe lured by the deep connection to identity and place that\
  \ seems to be a typical Acadian trait. \nSigns on the boardwalk show photos of it\
  \ being rebuilt over and over. Every few years a major storm destroys it. The piles\
  \ must be dragged back up the bay, the boards pulled from the dune and hammered\
  \ into place. It\u2019s a bit like Chiac: new pieces crowd in beside the old, and\
  \ any features that separated them are quickly erased by the sea and the wind. \n\
  I begged Michel for one more morsel of Chiac. It was like hoping for an extra fried\
  \ clam at the bottom of the bag. \nHe knocks on the wooden railing as if testing\
  \ its sturdiness. \u201CC\u2019est pretty right on.\u201D"
