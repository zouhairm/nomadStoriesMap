Text: "'The Last Thing I expected'\nIt\u2019s a freezing February evening in Osaka.\
  \ Snow has fallen and been neatly piled into little blocks along the pavement. Like\
  \ a real life game of Tetris. That\u2019s right; the ever efficient Japanese even\
  \ have a system for unexpected weather. Often described as a nation of worker ants,\
  \ I see people following the unspoken etiquette of their daily lives in pristine\
  \ order.\nTonight, I\u2019m celebrating the end of a very demanding work trip. I\u2019\
  m lucky I have my Japanese counter-part Kimi, to lead me through the maze of Osaka\u2019\
  s back streets to find an old area called Shinsekai. A world trapped in two times,\
  \ it has a rather special quality. Restaurants glimmer in the half light like rough\
  \ little gem stones. \nWe finally come to a stop outside of a narrow doorway open\
  \ but for a beaded curtain. The delicious smell of beer and frying oil greets us\
  \ and I look around to see many business men and women sitting and talking animatedly.\n\
  A young server welcomes us to a pair of high stools against an open kitchen and\
  \ as Kimi translates for me,  we are about to embark on a tasting a menu chosen\
  \ entirely by our chef Hiro. Each item is served on a stick and fried in a super\
  \ light, exquisitely flavoured, tempura style batter. Chicken, beef, now seafood\
  \ and vegetables, there\u2019s even one containing only mushy peas! Turns out this\
  \ variety of stick, Kushikatsu is very popular and often business colleagues will\
  \ come to relax after work by eating together, the sticks casually presented in\
  \ a small wooden tube, like a mini pencil pot. It\u2019s fun, the atmosphere is\
  \ relaxed and sociable. The chef puts Kimi and myself at ease, seeming to genuinely\
  \ enjoy picking out new sticks to create for us and watching our reactions. \nBy\
  \ day Japan has offered a very structured and formal face but here now in the comfort\
  \ of this little place Kimi is laughing openly and patting me on the hand as if\
  \ we had been life long pals, the stories about her beloved pet cat pour out and\
  \ as the night moves along I feel I\u2019m getting to finally see the Japan I\u2019\
  ve longed for, relaxed and social a real person behind the formal etiquette.\nAs\
  \ we say goodbye, I feel her invitation to visit her is more than a standard formal\
  \ invite. Exchanging small token gifts with each other she smiles at me and without\
  \ warning her mittened hands open wide, embraces me in a hug! I walk away feeling\
  \ I have finally seen a glimpse of the real Japan a social evening with smiles and\
  \ laughter and who would have expected it, a hug!"
