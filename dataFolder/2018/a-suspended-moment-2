Text: "Taking a rickety boat towards the island monasteries that dot Laka Tana is\
  \ definitely an adrenaline rush. Clutching the rusting railings and praying not\
  \ to top over, I watched in awe as local fisherman confidently made their way passed\
  \ us, easily traversing waters on traditional papyrus boats. As if the boat ride\
  \ over wasn\u2019t petrifying enough, trying to gain purchase onto the steep and\
  \ rocky island side as we transfer from boat to land was nothing to scoff at. At\
  \ this point, whether one comes to the monastic islands for religion or curiosity,\
  \ even the most agnostic will be on their knees and kissing the ground, thanking\
  \ god that the deceptively charming waters did not swallow them up. \n\nThe islands\
  \ of Lake Tana are home to more than twenty monastic churches that date back to\
  \ Ethiopia\u2019s Middle Ages. Due to its isolation, the island\u2019s residential\
  \ communities are small and nature sits undisturbed. The ancient monastic architecture\
  \ and tradition, sparse population, abundant wildlife and wide waters gives any\
  \ visitor a sense of mysticism, and I was no exception. Stepping onto the first\
  \ island, peering through the early morning fog as the forest birds sang bright,\
  \ I could feel the ethereal aura of the island welcome me. \n\nEthiopia\u2019s history\
  \ as a longstanding Christian country was a fact I was always peripherally aware\
  \ of growing up, but had never meditated on before. I was prepared to encounter\
  \ the devout and even participate in the popularly celebrated religious holidays,\
  \ but the last thing I expected was to have a spiritual moment. \n\nBut Lake Tana\
  \ and its monasteries have that effect on you.\n\nFollowing the nature trail into\
  \ the island center where the monastery lies felt like a spiritual pilgrimage. Between\
  \ the lake and island, I had never been so completely surrounded by nature in my\
  \ life. Playful monkeys and colorful butterflies kept us company to the end of the\
  \ trail, where we were met by cheerful children, excitedly dragging us to the ancient\
  \ sanctuaries. Incense clouded the air and the chanting of local clergy beckoned\
  \ us forward. Tears came to my eyes as I gazed at the impressive architecture and\
  \ perfectly preserved friezes. The air felt charged and I felt humbled by the timelessness\
  \ surrounding me. The ascetic lifestyle of the island residents made it feel unmarred\
  \ by modernity. The moment was intangible and transcended religion. Although it\
  \ was the last thing I expected, I wholeheartedly embraced it. On that island, I\
  \ had never felt more at peace."
