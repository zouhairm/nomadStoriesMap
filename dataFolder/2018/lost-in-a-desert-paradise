Text: "Story-telling: The intense warmth surrounded me as I stepped outdoors into\
  \ the Arabian Desert minutes after midnight. After years of wanting to visit the\
  \ Middle East, touching down into the mecca of culture and luxury that is Abu Dhabi,\
  \ was an exhilarating moment.  Regularly used as a stopover en route to Europe,\
  \ I felt content knowing that I would get to experience six consecutive days in\
  \ this only 45-year-old exquisite city, home to some of the most opulent resorts\
  \ and buildings in the world. But first, the Sheikh Zayed Mosque.\n\nAs the sun\
  \ shined its golden warmth onto the Mosque, I felt a large sense of gratitude and\
  \ appreciation because unlike others in the region, the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque\
  \ allows non-Muslims to experience its beauty and holiness. \nAs I walked inside,\
  \ I instantly felt a local connection as I began admiring the magnificent masterpiece\
  \ of modern Islamic architecture. Detailed and exquisite, the semi-precious stones\
  \ including mother-of-pearl, lapis lazuli and amethyst were decorated amongst the\
  \ marble pillars with graceful floral designs.\nI could hear the sound of beautiful\
  \ Arabic music in the background as I walked in awe around the holy building.\n\n\
  Informative travel writing: One of the largest mosques in the world, this architectural\
  \ beauty was nothing short of magnificent. Consisting of 82 marble domes, breath-taking\
  \ 24-carat gold gilded, Swarovski crystal chandeliers, the world\u2019s largest\
  \ hand knotted carpet and reflective pools surrounding the bright white and gold\
  \ marble holy building, the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque was an unbelievable and alluring\
  \ sight.\nBefore admission, there are separate sections for male and females to\
  \ enter into a small section where you will be provided with appropriate dress attire.\
  \ If you\u2019re a female, you will be given an abaya to put on over your clothing\
  \ to ensure modesty prior to entering the mosque. This ensures covering of your\
  \ body and hair. If you are a male and you have skin exposed, you will be provided\
  \ with a traditional kandura before you enter the Mosque. These are free of charge,\
  \ as is entry to the Mosque, and are returned upon exiting."
