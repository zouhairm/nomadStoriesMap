Text: "A bead of sweat made it\u2019s way down my back as the fan whirred overhead\
  \ and condensation pooled at the bottom of my ice water. The distant echo of howler\
  \ monkeys only broken by the screeching of scarlet macaws, I realised I had never\
  \ known humidity before moving to Costa Rica.\n\nMy friend was travelling through\
  \ South America and I was messaging her about possibly meeting in Peru. Machu Picchu\
  \ was calling and I desperately wanted to answer. I spent the next week contemplating\
  \ the decision, geographically I was close yet flight prices did not reflect it.\
  \ I was also completely unprepared, my backpack full of bikinis and yoga clothes,\
  \ not hiking boots and thermals.\n\nI decided I could earn more money later, I couldn\u2019\
  t get my best friend to Peru again, and jumped on the next flight. Day one and my\
  \ lack of appropriate clothing and equipment was glaringly obvious. Where others\
  \ had travelled to Peru for the sole purpose of hiking and wore top notch gear I\
  \ presented myself in tights, a down jacket bought on sale in Lima (not waterproof\
  \ by any means) and sneakers falling apart.\n\nWhat I didn't expect was that this\
  \ group of strangers would feel like friends I\u2019d known forever by the end of\
  \ the five day trek. We shared it all over the following days, eating meals together,\
  \ words of encouragement on long days of hiking, support during bouts altitude sickness,\
  \ bottles of rum and dances around the campfire. Sure, we probably knew too much\
  \ about each others\u2019 bowel movements and hadn\u2019t showered for days, but\
  \ we were happy to be experiencing the rugged mountains of Peru and sharing it with\
  \ one another.  \n\nThe final morning at 3am we began to ascend the seemingly endless\
  \ stairs to reach our holy grail, Machu Picchu. Rain began to fall and I reached\
  \ for my poncho (which resembled a thin garbage bag), but looking around at the\
  \ people I had been on this incredible journey with I couldn\u2019t help but smile.\
  \  \n\nA few hours later we arrived and entered the sacred grounds. Together we\
  \ stood in silent awe and for a moment I was breathless, not from physical exertion.\n\
  \nIn town we ran into some friendly tourists who looked us up and down, taking in\
  \ our bedraggled appearance and exhausted faces, fatigue virtually oozing from us.\
  \ They enquired if we were tired from taking the stairs that morning, explaining\
  \ they too had done so and knew how we felt. Laughter bubbled up and we doubled\
  \ over in a state of delirium, wondering how to possibly explain the journey we\
  \ had taken together."
