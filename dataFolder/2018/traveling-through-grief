Text: "Five months ago, I had just gotten home from work & was at my apartment in\
  \ DC. I got a call from my brother, Adam's, wife, Kim.  That was the moment my life\
  \ changed forever.  She told me that Aaron, my middle brother, had ended his own\
  \ life, my mom had just found him.\nWhat in Aaron\u2019s life brought him to the\
  \ decision that this was the best course of action? He had been struggling with\
  \ different mental illnesses for a while, but this ending was something none of\
  \ us knew was a possibility.  What was he feeling? Was this thought out? Why didn\u2019\
  t he talk to us about it? There are endless questions that will never be answered.\n\
  Ten days after my brother died, I went to Asia. It was a trip I\u2019d had planned\
  \ with one of my best friends for months. I was so incredibly confused about what\
  \ to do, my parents urged me to go, but a part of me was convinced it was too soon.\
  \ I attempted to go back to work two days after the funeral, I was completely useless.\
  \ I figured, why not go? I can always just come back early.\nAnd so we went. Aaron\
  \ was so unconventionally smart, incredibly technically savvy, & Japan just reminded\
  \ me of that. The bullet trains that follow the schedule down to the minute, impeccably\
  \ clean subway cars, & motion sensor escalators that shut down when people weren\u2019\
  t using made me think of Aaron & how he would\u2019ve loved to see them.  In reality,\
  \ what he probably would\u2019ve enjoyed the most are the bun-warming, tush-cleaning,\
  \ fart sound absorbing toilets, but the trains were cool too.\nAfter Japan, we traveled\
  \ to Thailand. We knew we were going to Phuket & Phi Phi, but we definitely didn\u2019\
  t know how to pronounce them.  Poo-ket? Fu-ket? Fuck-it? Our immature minds realized\
  \ they all sounded funny & definitely made for great puns. Aaron loved a good pun,\
  \ our family on my Dad\u2019s side has a very dry, word-play sense of humor.  However\
  \ Aaron could never help laughing after he told his jokes. I can just picture him\
  \ saying something like \u201CAh, fuck-it, let\u2019s do it!\u201D and then laughing\
  \ at his own cleverness. After realizing it was actually pronounced Poo-ket, we\
  \ grasped the fact we were going to Pi-Pi island, which brought even more puns &\
  \ unexpected smiles for us.\nSo what\u2019s the decision that pushed me to the edge?\
  \ It\u2019s more like the events of my life have pushed me there.  My middle brother\
  \ ended his own life\u2026where do I go from here?  More travel, more love, more\
  \ appreciation. The loss of my brother may have pushed me to the edge, but I\u2019\
  m determined to decide where I\u2019ll land."
