Text: "The sun is up and relentless. People shouting on the streets trying to sell\
  \ nuez de la India and water bottles. \"Maybe this is not the spot\u2026\" is all\
  \ I keep telling myself. Suddenly, I get the most unexpected and yet reassuring\
  \ slap on the back.\n\"Ready to see paradise?\", Lalo, or also known as Se\xF1or\
  \ Iguana, asks me.\n\"Cannot wait\" is my ordinary response to a man who illustrates\
  \ everything but ordinary. A man that always goes around with an iguana - called\
  \ Esmeralda - on his shoulder. \nMy new travel partner is hard to describe. Mystery\
  \ and fascination revolve around him, a free spirit, a youthful bohemian soul trapped\
  \ in an old body. \nI had met Lalo in Sayulita; a little surf town with a very laid\
  \ back-hippie vibe. The right kind of place to meet someone like Lalo.\n\"Lalo,\
  \ how long 'till we get there?\", Lalo turns to me as we're trying to find room\
  \ in an overcrowded bus. \"Mijo, like the song goes: you don't have to arrive first,\
  \ but you have to know how to arrive\u201D. At this point, I am having second thoughts\
  \ on Lalo\u2019s offer to visit his place up in the mountains after learning we\
  \ had to hitchhike too. I fear neither we will arrive first nor know how to arrive.\
  \ In next to no time though I realise I could not pass on an offer to see paradise.\n\
  Halfway there we are dropped off in a place where time seemed to have stopped. Octavio\
  \ Paz' \"Labyrinth of Solitude\" comes to mind. I start to remember a line in that\
  \ book that described Mexico as a place with \"different historic levels\" and \"\
  people who live before history\". Wherever we were at that moment in time was clearly\
  \ it.\nOn our last hitchhike my eyes enter a state of perplexity. A scenery filled\
  \ with mountains and the sun setting whilst sitting on the back of an old truck\
  \ with Lalo to my right and Esmeralda, hanging on for her life on top of a bicycle\
  \ wheel, to my left. A vision that reminded me of Salvador Dali when he once said\
  \ he could not come back to a country - Mexico - more surreal than his paintings.\n\
  \"Real Alto - Population: 11 people\" is the sign I now see with Esmeralda, whom\
  \ I had befriended, on my head. We had finally reached the promise land. The images\
  \ I had collected in my head by now feel everlasting. Little did I know though.\
  \ I had not seen it all just yet.\n\"Welcome to paradise. Come\". Soon enough I\
  \ freeze... I just... freeze. \n\"Did I tell you or not?\", Lalo quietly utters.\n\
  \"... you were right... it is paradise.\" \nOctavio Paz was right, Salvador Dali\
  \ was right, and Lalo Se\xF1or Iguana was right."
