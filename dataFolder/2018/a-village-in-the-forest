Text: "We\u2019re sitting on the porch in the dark, just watching the rain and the\
  \ constant lightning that flashes silently over the corrugated metal roofs of the\
  \ other cottages in the village, when the long warbling call to prayer suddenly\
  \ breaks out, from Baro\u2019s phone.\n\u201CCome, let\u2019s break fast.\u201D\
  \ He says to me with a smile on his stolid face. Other people are already coming\
  \ by, someone hands us umbrellas, and we step onto the volcanic gravel of the village\
  \ paths, while the rain pours down around us in big fat cold drops. Baro hobbles\
  \ along with a pronounced limp in his left leg, we make a little informal procession\
  \ under the umbrellas, around some cottages, between tall stalks of corn, and past\
  \ some round thatched huts.\n\nMost days, if it wasn\u2019t too wet, after the breaking\
  \ of the fast Baro would tend his teakettle over a little fire of coals, squatting\
  \ just off the porch. He made it from loose leaf tea, repeatedly pouring it from\
  \ the kettle into a tin cup and back into the kettle. He\u2019d spend an hour or\
  \ two at this, like a long slow ritual, as the moon slowly rose overhead. With no\
  \ electricity, you become acutely aware of the phase of the moon, especially since\
  \ Ramadan and fasting wouldn\u2019t be over until the moon finished its cycle.\n\
  With nothing but the light from the moon and the stars, and the orange glow of the\
  \ coals under the kettle, I would think about how very much like his nomadic ancestors\
  \ Baro looked at this moment.\n\nThey say Guinea is the \u201Cwatertank of Africa,\u201D\
  \ it is a beautiful lush green country in which two of Africa's great rivers, the\
  \ Senegal and Niger, both originate. For two weeks I was based in this little village\
  \ a long day's drive into the interior. During long evenings after work I'd sometimes\
  \ walk along the surrounding forest paths, the gaggle of village children would\
  \ all run around the village together, the adults would all collect on someone's\
  \ veranda to chat on into the darkness. Baro, my interpreter, had a transistor radio\
  \ which would give us reports of the outside world and burgeoning ebola epidemic\
  \ all around us.\nBaro came from the deserts of Mali to the east, but had come to\
  \ Guinea to escape political instability. Ebola wasn't in this village but it was\
  \ in Guinea's capital; if the capital were to become too dangerous, Mali would have\
  \ to be my own way out.\n\nDespite the turmoil of the outside world, here in the\
  \ village the children played happily, the adults continued their daily routines.\
  \ And Baro and I peacefully whiled away the hours."
