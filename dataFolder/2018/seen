Text: "We were greeted with curious eyes and welcoming smiles as we fumbled through\
  \ our broken Thai, asking directions to the stage. Amongst the chatter of the crowd\
  \ and heavy base of the music, an androgynous voice spoke in Thai so fast that my\
  \ brain only picked up the word \"kathoey.\" I grabbed my friend's hand and we slowly\
  \ moved towards the stage. The lights began to dim and the crowd began to relax.\
  \ In the low light, I could see a tall figure glide towards center stage. The lighting\
  \ began to brighten, followed by the music: a delicate piano melody accompanied\
  \ by the soft voice of a woman. \n\nThe spotlight stopped center stage and there\
  \ stood a tall and glamorous drag queen in a fitted black gown embellished in silver\
  \ sequins. As she lip-synced to the song, I was captivated by the accuracy of how\
  \ her lips moved to the words, almost as if the singer's voice had become her own.\
  \ I felt myself becoming deeply present as she brought the lyrics to life with emotion.\
  \ The song told of heartache from losing a lover, and an ode to the heart's inclination\
  \ to desire that which it has lost. \n\nI found myself transported back across the\
  \ ocean and several years to my first heartache with a man and the emotional turmoil\
  \ that gripped my soul. I sensed the anger, pain, and sadness standing there next\
  \ to me. They had taken the form of beings outside of me, walking towards the stage,\
  \ entranced by the harmonic ballad. I felt sense of panic as I watched them go -\
  \ these longtime inhabitants that brought grief but had also become an integral\
  \ part of my identity. \"I don't want them to go.\" \n\nAs I finished the thought,\
  \ the song reached its end. The performer lifted her hands, and anger, sadness,\
  \ and pain turned around and smiled. I shut my eyes, clutched my chest, and heard\
  \ a firm yet gentle voice from within me say, \"Let go.\" I could feel my mouth\
  \ give way to a smile as a tear rolled down my cheek - \"Thank you,\" I whispered.\
  \ \n\nI opened my eyes to see the performer standing center stage, smiling in my\
  \ direction. Our eyes locked, drawn together by an unspoken recognition, and something\
  \ in me shifted. In this moment, we saw each other. \n\nWe broke eye contact and\
  \ the cheers of the crowd rushed into my ears like a wave entering the opening of\
  \ a cave, its sound reverberating against the walls. I turned to my friend, and\
  \ with an inquisitive look on his face he asked, \"What's wrong?\" With a slight\
  \ smile I looked up at him and said, \"The last thing I expected just happened -\
  \ I found myself.\""
