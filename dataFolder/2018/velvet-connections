Text: "The day was mild. From a distance the hills had looked brown, dull. Now, the\
  \ woods beckoned. Sunlight filtered by branches. Suddenly there was a building.\
  \ Dirty concrete, flapping plastic, graffiti, radio tower. It brooded in recollections.\
  \ A trail led alongside a cement wall capped in barbed wire. This place was timeless.\
  \ Tension broke as the trees parted. Below was Bratislava and the Danube. My vantage\
  \ point, Devinska Kobyla, had a view of the Austria-Slovakia border. A day ago I\
  \ had been standing in frozen Kosice, East Slovakia, where there had been mountains,\
  \ crystalline lakes. I'd had friends' company. Dyno and Suzie were the reason I\
  \ was in that unsung place. A few months ago they returned to Slovakia. They ensured\
  \ that I felt right at home. Seeing Kosice through their eyes was perfect. It was\
  \ home. Dyno noted small stones in the path, where Medieval walls had been. Absent\
  \ for over a decade, yet this was familiar. Kosice held memories. Here Dyno\u2019\
  s first job, here an old haunt. A glimpse of their lives. They took it further,\
  \ boarding me in their home. The building smelled of decades past. We entered a\
  \ cosy apartment. Shoes off, house-shoes on, the norm here. The next day I saw the\
  \ mountains. I mentioned a wish to visit Auschwitz. Dyno is drawn to history. He\
  \ knew plenty about the war and Slovakia. He told me about the Soviet takeover.\
  \ It was the first time I heard of the tanks. His father had been fifteen years\
  \ old. A frightened child. At dinner the night before Suzie and Dyno warned not\
  \ to expect smiles. The youth were more likely to be amiable. But those who had\
  \ lived in Soviet times had a harsher outlook. People acted like this because they\
  \ had grown up afraid to trust. They had lived in fear for so long that they had\
  \ forgotten how. I wanted to know more about Slovakia. Bratislava held answers.\
  \ It's Old Town was fairy-tale-esque. Bratislava was shown to me by Lucia, native\
  \ to the city and who shares it for free (www.befreetours.com). She was passionate\
  \ and informative. Slovakia captivates. Glorious even in winter. The taste of Old\
  \ Europe. Soviet fingerprints. I never found the people inhospitable. Maybe I just\
  \ associated this place with my friends\u2019 kindness. I tried to see Slovakia\
  \ openly. There\u2019s a drawn look to the older citizens. My friends and Lucia\
  \ were too young to scar. Their children live without the shadow. Slovakia has a\
  \ future as breath-taking as the country itself."
