Text: "The destination was clear in my mind. I want to go to Cicely,  wonderland of\
  \ Northern Exposure,  in Spain it was translated as \u201CDoctor in Alaska\u201D\
  . ! I am a very big fan of this 90\u2019s TV series and that was the reason why\
  \ I wanted to go there.   Just when I looked for flights I discovered that Cicely\
  \ was not in Alaska... A cheap flight to Portland ( Oregon) took the decision for\
  \ me as well as the  the possibility of climbing the Gran Teton, a classic alpine\
  \ peak, which is not far considering that I was  travelling from Spain. \n\nPortland\
  \ was my first stop and the beginning of my journey. I was  planning stay in Portland\
  \ for just one night to rest after the flight but the \u201Cweird\u201D spirit of\
  \ the city kept me there for 5 days. Out of the bus station from the airport  my\
  \ first sight was a row of taxis with the slogan \"help us to keep Portland weird\"\
  \ on the side, and  it was everywhere... Did word \"weird\" have a different meaning\
  \ to the one I know? (this is first question you ask yourself when travelling to\
  \ countries of a different language and you do not understand something).  When\
  \ visiting Portland I was captivated by the charm of the city itself. People from\
  \ Portland are very friendly and easy-going and they are very proud of their city,\
  \ everythng is clean and tidy but not boring at all. In the morning I enjoyed a\
  \  walk by  the Columbia River and at night in any of the charming terraces with\
  \ live music.  Shopping has another meaning too. I really enjoyed its local and\
  \ unique little business and got excited at the iconic Powell's City of Books bookstore\
  \ occupaying  a whole city block. It has something difficult to describe but easy\
  \ to feel.\n\nAfter 5 days in Portland I decided it was time to continue my journey.\
  \ I reached Seattle after a 3.5 hours spectacular train ride that I can thoroughly\
  \ recommend to everyone that like landscapes. I loved Seattle too, in particular\
  \ the buildings and museums and of course the Space Needle.  Finally I rented a\
  \ car to drive to Cicely and within an hour  I was there not before passing by Twin\
  \ Peaks ( Snoqualmie).When I arrived in Cicely the only thing missing was the characters\
  \ walking along the street. It was like being inside one of the chapters! \n\nI\
  \ took a lot of pictures, and of course thousands at  Roslyn's mural, one of the\
  \ main locations of Northern Exposure. However, the one hanging now in my living\
  \ room at home amongst others from mountains and exotic places I been is from  my\
  \ beloved Portland."
