Text: "The three of us - two polish girls and I - were a usual hitchhiking team during\
  \ our year as volunteers in Armenia. This time we hit the road to Nagorno-Karabakh\
  \ - a disputed territory between Armenia and Azerbaijan. At that time, 16 years\
  \ had passed since the end of its 1994 war, yet the beauty of the flora and fauna\
  \ was still mixed with towns in ruin and closed roads that led to minefields. Nevertheless,\
  \ the hospitality and friendliness of the locals made it easy to hitchhike and find\
  \ a place to sleep. \nWe were catching out next ride from the Gandzasar monastery\
  \ to Stepanakert, when a military car stopped. At first we got cautious, but the\
  \ officer\u2019s friendly looking face calmed us down. We got into the car and,\
  \ as is natural hitchhiking procedure, began to introduce ourselves. When it was\
  \ my turn to name my home country, the officer cheerfully replied, \"Oh, Lithuania,\
  \ I served in the army there!\" The excitement was shared, as it\u2019s always nice\
  \ to meet a person that has visited your homeland. The officer continued, \"Remember\
  \ the January 13th, 1991? I was there at the TV tower!\u201D Still excited, I asked\
  \ which army he had served in. He proudly said, \u201Cthe Russian army!\u201D \u201C\
  Oh, okay\u201D \u2013 was all I managed to reply. Here, our conversation ended.\n\
  In 1991 Lithuania announced its independence from the Soviet Union. Consequently,\
  \ the Soviet Army began to seize important Lithuanian government buildings. At that\
  \ time my family lived close to the TV tower in Vilnius. \nI was about 5 years old\
  \ when loud explosions woke me in the middle of the night. My little sister was\
  \ crying, my grandmother tried unsuccessfully to reach my parents who were at a\
  \ birthday party a few blocks away. We waited, the scary sounds continuing. When\
  \ my parents arrived around dawn, they told us that they were on the way to the\
  \ TV tower when injured people started to appear. The Soviet tanks ran over and\
  \ killed 14 peaceful civilians that night, 702 were injured. I wasn\u2019t allowed\
  \ to see the next day's newspaper, but that night became a common theme of my nightmares.\n\
  As this flashed back to me in the silence of the car, I was too uncomfortable to\
  \ ask the officer more. Later we thanked him for the ride and he kindly offered\
  \ his phone number in case we needed further help. When the car left, I stood in\
  \ the road for a minute shocked, surprised, and overwhelmed by having had the chance\
  \ to meet one of the creators of my nightmares. This time he helped me. Now, each\
  \ January 13th I have a new story to remember."
