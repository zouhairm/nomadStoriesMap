Text: "Populated with a severe lack of people and an abundance of flowering gum trees\
  \ it seemed like a strange rural dream: complete with an urban state-of-the-art\
  \ McDonalds.\LFollowing a hand drawn map, I drove to the giggle-inducing named town;\
  \ Poowong. Trying to discern whether the scenery before me was more like a horror\
  \ or a lifetime movie, and which of those made me more frightened.\L\L\n\nIt was\
  \ more lush than anything I\u2019d seen in months. The rocks I drove between boasted\
  \ moss and above that, trees hung awning overhead. I saw a bridge in a small clearing\
  \ and thought, if I had half the mind to, I could jump in fully clothed and face\
  \ the harsh sun with a soggy coat of armour. \n\nOur three-day residence was a small\
  \ farm, momentarily being used as the camping grounds for around one hundred inner\
  \ city teens for a music festival. I hoped the cows wouldn\u2019t mind too much.\
  \ Australian Punk bands took to the makeshift stage made from tin and shaggy carpets.\
  \ Surrounded by yellow lights it was what my housemate would later describe to me\
  \ as classic. Before the stage was a mass of hay in place so that throngs of city\
  \ kids now turned country folk didn\u2019t have to stand in any of the cow shit\
  \ that blankets the grounds. I thought of them as tiny surprises that wait for us\
  \ on our two AM stumble back to our tents.\L\L\n\nIt rained on our last night. Maybe\
  \ it was the smoke in my eyes from the towering fire, our only source of heat, or\
  \ my sudden captivation by the stars, but I only then saw the singularness of each\
  \ rain drop like I never had. But this is the kind of place where you\u2019re never\
  \ too busy to watch the rain. Never too busy for a cup of coffee or \u2018just one\
  \ more game\u2019 of cards. Here, in this place that\u2019s name sounds like it\
  \ was elected as a running joke by a small majority of the town, I have never felt\
  \ so unrestrained or so endlessly calm, like nothing and everything matters just\
  \ enough."
