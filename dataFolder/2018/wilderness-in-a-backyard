Text: "At the end of an intense May, the fourth month solo traveling South America,\
  \ I finally reach Puerto Montt, Chile: the southernmost city along the Pan American\
  \ Highway; down below starts a wild land made of water, skies and rocks: Patagonia\
  \ and Tierra de Fuego.\nMy bus leaves me in a busy terminal near the shore. I am\
  \ dead tired and I only take notice of a cloudy azure sky and a deep blue sea. Leaving\
  \ the main street, tight homes and buildings greet me with their colorful roofs;\
  \ they are made of wood and sheet metal, worn out by time and salty air.\nThe inn\
  \ is wonderful; I have a spectacular window looking down to the bay. I fall asleep\
  \ looking at the clouds changing color in the evening.\nI wake up with no energy,\
  \ planning to spend all day in bed. However, breakfast is included, so I go downstairs\
  \ to meet the family running the inn. A general-like granny is managing the kitchen,\
  \ a couple of grandsons and a husband impervious to her orders. While eating I ask\
  \ about the surroundings: \u201CYou have to visit the fish market in Angelm\xF3\
  , no excuses!\u201D\nThe air is cold but the low sun makes it comfortable. The walk\
  \ to the market is inside a fiord, towards the port; it is not a fancy touristic\
  \ marina, but a commercial harbor: big ships go in and out, containers are moved\
  \ around, fishing boats are repaired and refurbished. \u201CThis is the door to\
  \ Tierra de Fuego!\u201D tells me one of the fishermen; it is true, I have a clear\
  \ feeling of frontier.\nDespite the port, there is a sort of silence near the fish\
  \ market, the only noises are seagulls screaming and an old man steering a small\
  \ motorboat. The market is a convoluted dark-pink building alternating touristic\
  \ restaurants to fish vendors. Nothing exceptional.\nA little deluded, I move to\
  \ the shore on the back of the market to see the rest of the fiord. Water seems\
  \ cold, and crystal clear. Suddenly they emerge: a group of four seals reaches the\
  \ surface, a couple of meters away. My surprise is so overwhelming that I almost\
  \ forget that I have a camera, that I am tired and weary, that it was a long journey.\
  \ We are not in a national park, nonetheless they are there, wild creatures so close\
  \ to humans, not afraid of us: simply there enjoying the sun and lazily swimming\
  \ in the low waters. Probably they are simply waiting for some fish scraps from\
  \ the market, but seeing how gently they move in the water and play together, at\
  \ such a short distance from me, fills me with joy. I sit on the sand, enjoying\
  \ the sun with them, like old friends."
