Text: "When I went to London this winter I was expecting the \u201Cnormal\u201D stuff:\
  \ red phone cabins, lots of tourists in front of Buckingham Palace, the soldiers\
  \ wearing fancy outfits, some fish and chips and a great walk in the romantic and\
  \ famous Notting Hill. Well... That\u2019s not even close from all the things I\
  \ did in UK! \nThe first day my family and I went to visit Piccadilly Circus, the\
  \ Kensington And Hyde Parks, the beautiful Buckingham Palace and we finished watching\
  \ the London Eye. I was surprised by how kind and nice were all the people that\
  \ I talked to! Also, I need to say that the weather was friendly but COLD, really\
  \ cold (at least for an Argentinian girl who lives in the centre of the country\
  \ where the cold days are not super cold). \nThe next day we decided to do something\
  \ different and outside London. We bought some tickets to visit Oxford, Bourton\
  \ on the Water and Stratford. We had an amazing day! The best part of the trip was\
  \ the scones and the carrot cake that we ate at five o\u2019clock in an historic\
  \ tea house, in Stratford, the city of Shakespeare! The people in there were nice\
  \ and maked us feel welcome all the time. I recommend to do this trip to all the\
  \ people who comes to UK at least for five days,  worth it seriously"
