Text: "I was at Darren and Jackie Brown\u2019s little vineyard in Tasmania, adorably\
  \ called Puddleduck after a stray duck made their home his own, when I received\
  \ a call. \n\u201CWhen will your wine tour be over, my dear?\u201D \nA motherly\
  \ voice at the other end. I recognised it as that of Sue Bailey, the press secretary\
  \ of Australian senator Lisa Singh. I had interviewed the Indian-origin politician\
  \ in Hobart for my newspaper in India the previous day. But why was she calling?\
  \ Did Senator Singh want to change something in the interview? Thinking on those\
  \ lines, I informed Sue I would be done by 5pm. \n\u201CCould I come pick you up?\
  \ My family and I would love to have you over for dinner.\u201D\nA little taken\
  \ aback, I said yes, mostly so as not to sound rude. \nWhen the bus of the wine\
  \ tour company pulled into Salamanca Place in the heart of Hobart, there she was,\
  \ waiting with her silver sedan. We drove up to the suburbs and entered her home.\
  \ It seemed the place had been hit by a hurricane. Suitcases and backpacks and clothes\
  \ and shoes were everywhere. \n\u201CPlease excuse the mess. We are going away on\
  \ holiday tomorrow.\u201D \nI smiled and remembered the disaster zone my mum\u2019\
  s bedroom is before every trip. \nI met Sue\u2019s husband Norman and their son\
  \ Ray. We sat down for a simple meal and some (more) wine. And we talked. Both Sue\
  \ and Norm had started off as journalists and we had a swell time trading newsroom\
  \ stories. \nAfter the meal, Sue dropped me to my hotel. I knew she had a morning\
  \ flight and piles of packing left. I had to ask her why she invited me home, when\
  \ she barely knew me. \n\u201CSam, I have two daughters your age. If they went travelling\
  \ to another country all alone, I would like to believe that someone would take\
  \ them in and give them a home-cooked meal.\u201D \nAfter 23 days of cold sandwiches\
  \ in cafes and \u2018table for one\u2019 in restaurants across Australia, I knew\
  \ what this hot meal with a family meant to me. I was moved by the warmth in this\
  \ stranger\u2019s gesture, a stranger who that evening became a friend. \nThat was\
  \ five years ago. Sue and I correspond to this day. She tells me about her travels,\
  \ the election in Tasmania and her elder daughter\u2019s baby. I tell her about\
  \ my work, my mum\u2019s surgery and the beautiful Calcutta winter. The guest room\
  \ in my home is ready for Sue, whenever she plans that \u201Cbig India trip\u201D\
  . And she insists her home will be \u201Cmuch cleaner\u201D the next time I visit.\
  \ \nIf only she knew how fondly I look back at that mess and all the love I found\
  \ in its midst that evening."
