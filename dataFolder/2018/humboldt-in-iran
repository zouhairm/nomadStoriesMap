Text: "Berlin. First Wednesday of October 2014. I call my family back home to tell\
  \ them I\u2019m just about to leave for Tehran. Tomorrow. My announcement catches\
  \ them by surprise and my mother can\u2019t refrain from exclaiming \u201COh my\
  \ God!\u201D with her mind set on the powder keg of the Middle East and the atrocities\
  \ that are being committed.\n\nTwo hundred years ago, Alexander von Humboldt said\
  \ that the most dangerous worldview is the worldview of those who have not viewed\
  \ the world.\nI had not viewed Iran yet, but I did a lot of research before departing.\
  \ This makes me believe it\u2019s a safe country, despite all the negative reports\
  \ it gets in the West. I\u2019ll board the plane. The die is cast.\n\nDuring the\
  \ approach to IKA International Airport and while some Iranian women are already\
  \ covering their hair, I look out the window and get impressed by the brown, dusty,\
  \ thirsty, flat and desolate landscape. I land in the middle of nowhere, my heart\
  \ pounds.\nHowever, everything\u2019s a breeze, so after exchanging some euros at\
  \ the terminal, it doesn\u2019t take me long before I sit in a cab and experience\
  \ first-hand how the real people are. They.\nI know that many jaw-dropping World\
  \ Heritage sites await me around old Persia, but in the end it will be its welcoming\
  \ and helpful dwellers who will win my heart.\n\nTaking taxis in unfamiliar places\
  \ should make travelers expect the unexpected. In Iran, for example, it\u2019s very\
  \ common to share cab fares with strangers who get on and off endlessly. So imagine\
  \ yourself in a taxi in Yazd -a town that claims to be the oldest continuously inhabited\
  \ city on Earth- or in Esfahan -as valuable as One Half of the World as the saying\
  \ goes in Persian- and, suddenly, a newcomer starts talking to you in English and,\
  \ before he gets off, he quickly scrawls his contact details in a piece of paper\
  \ just in case you might need some help. Have you ever experienced such a kind gesture?\n\
  \nThe truth is that I spend my solo trip traveling from one surprise to another,\
  \ like when a civil servant brings me a cup of tea in Mashhad\u2019s post office;\
  \ or when receptionists in three different hotels allow me to use their computers\
  \ to check my e-mails; or when a taxi driver in Kashan calls and books a ticket\
  \ on my behalf on the way to the bus station without expecting anything in return;\
  \ or when girls pose in front of my camera and then give me sweets. But\u2026 weren\u2019\
  t they all aggressive and fundamentalists? Can it be that the most dangerous Iranview\
  \ is the Iranview of those who have not viewed Iran?"
