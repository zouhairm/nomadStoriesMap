Text: "This story goes back to 2013. This is also the year that I embarked on one\
  \ of the holiest pilgrim journeys, in hinduism- The Char Dham (The Four Holy Pilgrimages).\n\
  \nMy maternal grandparents were my second love, after my mother ofcourse.\nWe live\
  \ in Mumbai, a very well developed metropolitan city and also India's financial\
  \ capital.The journey of the Chaar Dham is a long, exhaustive journey as it requires\
  \ the traveller to travel to North India which is very picturesque but not very\
  \ developed. My mom was adamant on the trip as we hindus believe this trip relieves\
  \ us(and those we pray for) of all sins. My grandparents were against the journey\
  \ but we decided against them, as this was beneficial for them too. \nDay 1 of the\
  \ Journey was very exciting. We took off for Haridwar Junction- A small town in\
  \ North India from where we boarded a bus for the first Dham.\n\nThe Himalayas are\
  \ divides into three ranges - the Shivaliks(the foothills), the Medium and the Greater\
  \ Himalayas. As our bus entered the Shivaliks, I held my breath as the mountain\
  \ roads got narrower with increasing altitude.If this wasnt enough, there were traces\
  \ of landslides and accidents all over the roads.This doesnt change the fact that\
  \ the scenic beauty of the villages below the mountains can only be expressed by\
  \ a classic poet. Lush green grounds, Healthy Cattle, Step Farms-it was like a geography\
  \ book opened in a 3D panoramic view. \nAs we ascended,mother nature taunted my\
  \ hunger with Oreo Mountains.The Snow Covered peaks were so beautiful that if aliens\
  \ ever ascended, they'd ignore us all and build a civilization on those ranges.\n\
  We reached our first Dhaam eventually- Yamunotri Dham. This Dham is also the source\
  \ for the river Yamuna that flows through many states across north india providing\
  \ livelihood to milions. We took blessings from the Diety and as we entered the\
  \ hotel lobby, I receieved a devastating phone call.My granddad had passed away.\
  \ Three Dhams were pending and I couldnt care less.We hired a car back to the Shivaliks\
  \ and took a plane back to Mumbai.\nI had prayed for us all.How could this happen.I\
  \ questioned the very existence of God.Someone switched on the television.There\
  \ had been a massive flood that had killed 7000 people in Kedarnath-the Second Dham\
  \ that we were supposed to reach the very same day. Was religion hoax? Did grandpa\
  \ really attain Moksha ? Was his death meant to save us ? I know not & may never\
  \ know but it gave me FAITH, the one thing i lacked- the last thing I expected."
