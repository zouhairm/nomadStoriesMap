Text: "As my roommates and I approached the poorly lit intersection of the square,\
  \ my muscles contracted. Could that be him, I thought.\n\n\u201COh dear!\u201D I\
  \ mumbled quietly, as my face turned hot. I picked up my pace to pass the familiar\
  \ looking vendor, not wanting to relive that morning.\n\nThat morning, my guard\
  \ was down- feverish, tired from an overnight bus, and frazzled from missing my\
  \ connecting bus. I sat towards the front of the next bus to Bacalar, to ensure\
  \ I did not miss my stop. As people boarded, I quietly observed. It was mainly local\
  \ Mexicans who appeared to be commuting to work. Amongst them was a middle-aged\
  \ fellow, with a large, red, white, and blue, duffle bag. He put the bag in the\
  \ overhead compartment and sat down beside me.\n\nLike most friendly locals I met,\
  \ he began chatting. While I tried my best to hold a conversation, my Spanish dropped\
  \ a few levels as I was unwell. Not only did I have trouble forming sentences, but\
  \ I also struggled to understand the basics. After asking him to repeat a few times\
  \ and I embarrassingly said \u201CDisculpe, no entiendo.\u201D (Sorry, I do not\
  \ understand).\n\nAs I continued to struggle, he persisted with his questions. Then\
  \ it hit me! I understood him! My body tensed up, worried he saw it in my face.\
  \ I became more aware of him. He got closer. I felt his warm, sweaty arm against\
  \ mine. I put my earphones in and turned to watch the passing greenery. Instead\
  \ of music, I opted to listen to my immediate surrounding.\n\nFrom the corner of\
  \ my eyes, I saw him bring his bag. He took a paper out to show me. Not appreciating\
  \ my indifference, he put his arm around me and pulled me close. Shocked, I yelled\
  \ \u201CThis is not okay!\u201D in Spanish, as I returned his arm. I looked at his\
  \ confused face, which fueled my anger. He leaned in closer, close enough to smell\
  \ his warm, morning breath.\n\nHow dare he! I thought. Then I reminded myself that\
  \ this is normal here, especially in rural areas. For five weeks, I tackled the\
  \ expected advances from local men with humor, treating them as cultural experiences.\
  \ This was different. A feeling of helplessness swept over me. Cornered, I loudly\
  \ repeated \u201CThis is not okay! I don\u2019t want this!\u201D.\n\nSoon, he requested\
  \ to get off, few miles before Bacalar. A wave of relief rushed over, almost bringing\
  \ me to tears. As the bus stopped, he offered me his hand. Not understanding what\
  \ he wanted, I looked at him.\n\nWith my heart drumming loudly against my chest,\
  \ I shook his hand and hoped I would never see him again."
