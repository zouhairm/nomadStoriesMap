Text: "The ghosts of Hoia Baciu didn't stay in their forest. They came looking for\
  \ me in other parts of Romania, calling me closer. They reached out through blurry\
  \ photos on ghost-hunting websites with spindly, tree-branch hands to raise shivers\
  \ on my skin. When I got off the night train and made my way down the main street\
  \ of Cluj, street lights flickered off just before I approached them. I darted inside\
  \ the doorway of Transylvania hostel and shut it firmly on the misbehaving shadows.\n\
  \nI knew the ghosts wouldn\u2019t leave me alone until I went to the forest, but\
  \ I was determined to be prepared. Armed with noodles and my computer, I did my\
  \ ghost research in the hostel kitchen, zooming in on strange shapes in photos of\
  \ the forest. Fellow travelers chatted around me, and and I didn\u2019t tune into\
  \ them until one of the hostel workers casually announced as she poured a cup of\
  \ coffee, \u201CThere\u2019s a rave in Hoia Baciu tonight.\u201D\n\nMy phone was\
  \ dead, my head was fuzzy from lack of sleep, and outside it was as dark as the\
  \ space between stars. But I could also hear a buzzing noise that was just a little\
  \ louder than my fear. It could have been ghosts or just the voices of the Australian\
  \ boys and French girls who tugged me out of my chair and into a taxi. \"Come see\
  \ me in the darkness,\" it seemed to say, \"or not at all.\"\n\nThe taxi left us\
  \ at the edge of the trees. Without flashlights or a path, we had nothing to follow\
  \ but the music, distant and deep with a drum-like beat. Each step took me deeper\
  \ into uncertainty. Every bush held a worrying rustle, every branch a flash that\
  \ could have been eyes. The ground was soft and insecure, and sometimes the shadows\
  \ were so complete that they would swallow my friends entirely. My heart beat faster\
  \ than the music as I followed them into the mouth of a monster made of night.\n\
  \nAnd then the lights found us. There was a tent and a DJ table and fires scattered\
  \ throughout the tree-covered slope. Young Romanians and travelers laughed and danced\
  \ between them like dizzy asteroids trying to connect constellations. \n\nI blinked,\
  \ and the scene turned into a negative photograph of itself. The shadows I had been\
  \ wary of became lights. A fluffy white dog, a girl\u2019s silver earrings, red\
  \ strobe lights, and the glare of phone screens took the form of the ghosts I had\
  \ been looking for. They were something supernatural but undeniably alive."
