Text: "I had just packed my bags, food in one hand, camera bag in the other and we\
  \ set off for Citrusdal.  We arrived at Cederkloof Botanical Retreat approximately\
  \ two and a half hours later, excited about the luxury accommodation that the website\
  \ had promised us. On arrival, the temperature in the car read scorching 44 degrees\
  \ Celsius; when we left home, it was only 24 degrees Celsius. The word of the weekend\
  \ was, \u2018acclimatize\u2019. As we emptied our luggage, I constantly saved the\
  \ mental note, \u2018Acclimatise, Keshia, acclimatise\u2019.\n\nNever in my life\
  \ had I been more grateful for an air-conditioner. Our home for the weekend consisted\
  \ of three sections; two bedrooms which each came with a double bed for two, each\
  \ room also had their own air conditioner, bathroom and toilet. The kitchen and\
  \ lounge area was a shared space.\n\n\u2018Acclimatise,\u2019 I reminded myself\
  \ \u2013 I believe that stating that the weather is, \u2018boiling hot\u2019 probably\
  \ originated from Citrusdal. Not forgetting the fact that the lounge area was air-conditioner\
  \ barren. \n\nIronically enough, you do eventually acclimatise.\n \nMy favourite\
  \ spot for the entire weekend was on the porch. The porch has a bench, a table with\
  \ chairs and a Jacuzzi. Taking full advantage of my surroundings, I spent most of\
  \ my time here. \n\nWe spent the Saturday evening cooking up a storm and I was having\
  \ a great time until I had just gotten into bed and heard my friend say, \u2018\
  Keshia, come here,\u2019 in a high-pitched tone that, knowing my friend, instantly\
  \ signalled fear. I refused to be the hero and later heard her say two words: \u2018\
  Keshia, tarantula\u2019.\n\nI never knew that I was an arachnophobe until a big,\
  \ hairy tarantula decided to grace us with its presence, and I was instantly paralysed\
  \ by fear. \nMy loving friend is tiny but filled with strength and managed to chase\
  \ it down although it was travelling at what seemed like the speed of light across\
  \ our room as I helplessly stood on the bed, ready to burst into tears. I was having\
  \ a relaxing weekend being away from my life, the last thing I expected was to face\
  \ my fears in the middle of my tranquillity. I stood shaking as if I had been attacked,\
  \ unable to move because of how afraid I was.\n\nThe one thing I loved about this\
  \ place, was that it was completely silent. Your chalet is surrounded by bushes\
  \ and your neighbours are so far out of sight that you can barely consider them\
  \ neighbours. If you\u2019re looking to get away and disconnect from your busy life,\
  \ which I was, then this is the place for you."
