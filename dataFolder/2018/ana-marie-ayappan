Text: "Ana is a woman in her late 50s. During the week that I spent in her homestay,\
  \ we always smiled at each other as she went about her daily chores and I walked\
  \ down the hill to explore. Sometimes she'd ask me how I was doing in her broken\
  \ English and I'd give her an assuring smile that'd make her say \"Good\".\n\nOne\
  \ afternoon when I went over to her section of the cottage to ask for some salt,\
  \ she invited me in to drink a cup of tea. Walking inside, I noticed a shelf full\
  \ of photographs on proud display in their otherwise modest home. Sitting next to\
  \ the earthen oven, she asked me if I wanted ginger in my tea before explaining\
  \ to me the essence of cooking on wood. She asked me about my family in Kolkata;\
  \ about the culture of Bengal and handed me a steel glass.\n\nAna Marie Ayappan\
  \ was born in a village near the town of Kodaikanal. She was raised in a secular\
  \ Tamil family with two brothers and a sister. Their father was a Brahmin and mother\
  \ a Protestant. The harmony in their religious life allowed Jesus and the Hindu\
  \ Gods to exist peacefully under the same roof.\n\nAna was the first of her siblings\
  \ to get married. At 20 she moved with her husband Philip to the quaint village\
  \ of Vattakanal. A few months after their wedding, her sister gifted her an Indian\
  \ puppy that she named \"Kutty\", meaning 'child' or 'baby' in Tamil. Kutty has\
  \ been her constant companion over the past many years and has fathered many puppies,\
  \ while Ana watched her sons, Charles and Shyaam, grow up. He\u2019s guarded their\
  \ home as she visited Kodai, almost 7kms away, while her husband worked in the woods\
  \ behind the hut. When the tourism boomed in the circular valley, Kutty has seen\
  \ her deal with strangers from all across the world who lived in her cosy homestay.\
  \ He's protected her family from bison who often graze outside the jungles of Nilgiri\
  \ and has driven away countless monkeys who come to steal pears.\n\nOnce fondly\
  \ called \"Baby\" by her father, Ana Marie thinks the name hardly suits her anymore.\
  \ More importantly, it doesn't suit her image in society. She is now an old woman\
  \ with a gait, living with her ageing husband and working sons, managing a hospitality\
  \ business. Most people call her Aunty, an endearment for neighbours and other older\
  \ women in India. Ana Marie has never stepped out of the Dindigul district of Tamil\
  \ Nadu yet she's seen it all.\n\nAs I put my cup down and she invited me to look\
  \ at the photographs on the wall, it hit me that I knew so much about her without\
  \ us speaking a common tongue."
