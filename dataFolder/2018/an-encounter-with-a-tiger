Text: "I met Tiger in Hospet. He was a tuk-tuk driver and insisted that I use his\
  \ services to get to Hampi. His offer was so ridiculously low, I laughed. He smiled.\
  \ Within minutes of departing, he pulled over and motioned for me to sit with him\
  \ up front. I firmly told him, \u201CNo.\u201D He responded, \u201CMadam, the price\
  \ is too low for me to drive you.  You must drive yourself.\u201D Again I laughed.\
  \ He was serious, \u201CMadam, I show you.\u201D I sat beside him and off we went\
  \ - somehow avoiding every vehicle, person, animal, manure pile, and pothole that\
  \ happened our way!  \n\nThat journey was the start of a beautiful friendship. Tiger\
  \ is in a low caste. No matter how hard he works, he will never attain a higher\
  \ status. He dropped out of college to care for his ailing parents. They lived in\
  \ a shack where his parents slept on the dirt floor in the kitchen; he in the only\
  \ other room also on the dirt floor. To bathe, they went to the river.  I say lived\
  \ because only a few months after I left, the government decided to widen the road.\
  \ They literally ripped Tiger\u2019s shack in half! Tiger\u2019s dad also lost the\
  \ small store he operated as it had been alongside their house. Their only source\
  \ of income was Tiger\u2019s tuk-tuk business.\n\nUnfortunately Tiger does not own\
  \ his tuk-tuk. To meet his daily expenses, he must earn 600 rupees (400 to the man\
  \ who owns the tuk-tuk and 200 for fuel.) To put that in perspective, it costs 100\
  \ rupees to go from the rail station in Hospet to Hampi. A Hampi temple tour costs\
  \ 800 rupees (and more time and fuel).\n\nI learned that a tuk-tuk costs $3000 USD.\
  \ To TIger, that is a fortune! No matter how hard worked, he\u2019d never earn that\
  \ in a lifetime. I decided to set up a crowd source fund but did not tell him. I\
  \ would be returning in two months to celebrate our birthdays and I wanted to surprise\
  \ him. I prayed my friends would be generous.\n\nAs promised, I returned and on\
  \ the evening of our birthdays, Tiger took me to a restaurant. Inside, his friends\
  \ had gathered. They sang \u201CHappy Birthday\u201D and Tiger produced a cake complete\
  \ with a personalized inscription and singing candle.  I was in awe!  I had never\
  \ seen such a cake anywhere in India.  Where had he found it and how could he afford\
  \ it?  \n\nThe next day I surprised TIger. I had raised $700. With his $300, we\
  \ had $1000 - enough to secure a loan. The bank manager interrogated Tiger and I\
  \ as if we were criminals. Eventually a loan was secured and Tiger would have his\
  \ tuk-tuk within six months. A life had been changed."
