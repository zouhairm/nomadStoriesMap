Text: "The train slowly rolled through the Siberian forest. We approached a bend,\
  \ and the sun broke through the dense line of larch trees. With the rays now hitting\
  \ the smudgy windows, dancing particles of dust became visible inside the carriage.\n\
  The rhythmic rattling caused by the tracks was soothing and almost made me forget\
  \ about the stifling heat and my sweaty limbs sticking together. The air smelled\
  \ of instant noodles and the fact that we shared one single bathroom with more than\
  \ fifty other people. It wasn't unpleasant, though, but rather something I had long\
  \ accepted and knew I couldn't change.\nWe were traveling in platzkart, the most\
  \ affordable and therefore least private third class. For the locals, this was simply\
  \ the most convenient mode of travel. But for us, it was the beginning of what would\
  \ become one of our greatest adventures. We were here because we embarked on a mission:\
  \ to travel around the world without setting foot on a plane. \nArmed with ramen\
  \ noodles, instant coffee, and a deck of cards, we boarded this train that would\
  \ take us through five time zones and cover a distance of more than 5000 kilometers.\
  \ \nI had no idea where we were, exactly. Somewhere between Yekaterinburg and Irkutsk\
  \ -  roughly. All I knew was that we were two and a half days into the train ride,\
  \ and at the last stop, which was around seven hours ago, we picked up a group of\
  \ Russian soldiers that moved into the compartments neighboring ours. \nWe were\
  \ sitting on their berths, tightly packed and pressed against each other due to\
  \ the lack of space. The closeness of our bodies heightened my awareness of the\
  \ smell, that was considerably worse in this part of the wagon. One of them nudged\
  \ me with his elbow and pointed to the backpack that we used instead of a table.\
  \ I looked at the cards spread on it and then compared them to those held in my\
  \ hand. I put down a heart seven, and my move was met with a burst of laughter.\
  \ I looked up. Surrounding me were at least twenty of the soldiers, all dressed\
  \ in dark green uniforms. Someone patted my back. Somehow, I had won the second\
  \ game in a row. The game was Durak, that much I knew, but any explanation beyond\
  \ that was lost in translation \u2013 literally.\nBut here, on this train, the language\
  \ barrier didn't matter. In our carriage, we shared everything. Meals, stories,\
  \ and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 the little amount of space available.\nBecause\
  \ after all, the essentials in life demand no words. \nGenuine laughter, amazing\
  \ food, and great company."
