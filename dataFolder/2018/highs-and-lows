Text: "My breathing came in bursts. No limb was spared from the chronic aching; the\
  \ pain pulsated after every step I took, a constant reminder of how much I had hiked\
  \ in the past five days. Using rocks to pull myself up higher and higher, I couldn\u2019\
  t shake the words from my mind...\n\n'No-one told you to do this.'\n\nI couldn\u2019\
  t have been more excited at the thought of travelling to Morocco for ten days, five\
  \ of which I\u2019d spend hiking the tallest mountain in North Africa \u2013 Mount\
  \ Toubkal. Months of part-time work and fundraising for a children\u2019s charity\
  \ had sent me to Morocco, and although the prospect of scouring a mountain range\
  \ seemed daunting, I thought minimal training beforehand would suffice and convinced\
  \ myself that I\u2019d be totally fine. \n\nFunny that.\n\nAfter a horrific flight\
  \ to Marrakesh via Casablanca, we had a mere five hours sleep before embarking on\
  \ our journey. There was a huge group of us \u2013 mostly university students \u2013\
  \ and getting to know each other throughout the trek was a small spark of solace\
  \ shining in a grey sky of soul-destroying reality. Each day began before sunrise;\
  \ we packed our bags, placed one foot in front of the other and didn\u2019t stop\
  \ for hours. The monotony of left, right, left, right, was soothing at times, mind-numbing\
  \ at others and excruciating often. Up and down we went, passing valleys, lakes\
  \ and tiny villages that seemed to belong to another world. Some hours were spent\
  \ in agony, fighting bitterly against the altitude, ignoring the craving for proper\
  \ food, for proper shelter. Some hours were spent striding, music pumping, adrenaline\
  \ rushing. As I sat down to enjoy a final meal of rice and bread (again) I suddenly\
  \ thought about how much the trek seemed to mirror life, with all the ups and downs,\
  \ the highs and lows.\n\nThe last hours were spent in silence. We strode purposefully,\
  \ full of determination. Our guides leapt ahead of us, agile as cheetahs, holding\
  \ out their hands for us as we struggled over boulders. The sun was threatening\
  \ to emerge so we pushed as hard as we could until the cliff edge came into view\
  \ and suddenly the whole mountain range revealed itself to us in a golden haze.\
  \ The moments that followed were pure elation; we hugged and whooped and danced\
  \ around, our limbs suddenly revived. Whipping around a few minutes later I noticed\
  \ a girl who had been struggling for the past day or two, gripping a guide\u2019\
  s hand tightly and tears spilling down her cheeks. I grinned. Never had I felt so\
  \ proud before, for my friends or myself."
