Text: "\u201CSo, you\u2019re coming to my sister\u2019s wedding in India, right,\u201D\
  \ my friend asked nonchalantly over dinner one day. My heart instantly palpitated,\
  \ not only in happiness for my friend, but in excitement for the perfect chance\
  \ to fulfill a long-time dream - to quit my job, travel the world, and set my soul\
  \ free. In that moment, life invited me to grab it by the horns and go along with\
  \ its thrilling ride, but I soon discovered not everyone wanted to share my excitement.\n\
  \nOver the next few weeks, family, friends, and even strangers offered opinions\
  \ on what I\u2019d encounter as a woman, alone, in a country \u201Clike India.\u201D\
  \ On a weekly basis, my in-basket brimmed with emails full of links to articles\
  \ and videos depicting the atrocities India had to offer. On a daily basis, it was\
  \ normal to hear:\n\n\u201CYou know, India is full of predators just waiting to\
  \ take advantage of women traveling like you.\u201D\n\n\u201CDon\u2019t you think\
  \ you\u2019re putting yourself in unnecessary danger by traveling alone in India?\
  \ It\u2019s ridiculous to think this is sane!\u201D\n\n\u201CI wouldn\u2019t travel\
  \ India by myself, and I\u2019m Indian! People will try to scam you everywhere,\
  \ make rude comments...I\u2019m honestly really nervous for you.\u201D\n\nI saw\
  \ genuine fear in their eye, and heard tense anxiety in their voices. Even though\
  \ I\u2019d voraciously read through hundreds of uplifting blog posts in an attempt\
  \ to drown out the suffocating voices,I laid in bed wondering if the decision to\
  \ travel alone could bury me rather than enlighten me.\n\nThe journey across India\
  \ initially began with a few heavy knots in my stomach (no, it wasn\u2019t the curry\
  \ I\u2019d eaten for dinner the night before), but in a pleasantly surprising way,\
  \ all of the fears withered away with each day.\n\nWhere I anticipated rapists and\
  \ robbers, I found deep conversations that lasted hours without pause. When I believed\
  \ I\u2019d see widespread underdevelopment, a dynamic and rich history of culture,\
  \ tradition, intellect, and art consumed all of my senses. Where others warned of\
  \ billions of people fighting to protect only themselves, I instead I found gentle\
  \ souls offering me their hands across hectic streets, old men speaking compassionately\
  \ with stray dogs, and women laughing together in sisterhood.\n\nDon\u2019t get\
  \ me wrong, India has its issues to work on, but I\u2019m glad to say all the fears\
  \ didn't last. India and its people offer up themselves willingly and in the most\
  \ beautiful way. Those who think otherwise just simply haven't seen the truth for\
  \ themselves."
