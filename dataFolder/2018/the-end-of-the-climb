Text: "As I looked across the bright blue waters, I wondered how something could possess\
  \ such raw beauty. Nestled between the stark Himalayan mountain landscape of Ladakh\
  \ at an altitude of 14000 feet, lies a vast deep blue stretch of water which is\
  \ known to the locals as Pangong Tso. \nI have always been that kind of traveler\
  \ that doesn\u2019t just go to a place, see the place and move on to the next one.\
  \ So, as I looked at snow-capped mountains around me, there was a calling that drew\
  \ me towards them. As the wind grew colder, my decision to climb one the hills seemed\
  \ riskier but I had made up my mind. I went back to the tent, packed some water\
  \ and a first aid kit in case anything happened up there. As I was traveling with\
  \ my friends, I asked if they wanted to come along. Though I knew just one of them\
  \ was going to accompany me on this journey of mine. Now what you need to know about\
  \ Shaun is that he has always been part of my impulsive detours for as long as I\
  \ can remember.\nI checked my watch, it was 4 pm, which gave us more than enough\
  \ time to get to the top and down before it got dark. We started walking towards\
  \ the base of the hill and as we got closer, I saw that the hill wasn\u2019t as\
  \ small as we thought. At this point both of us looked at each other and had the\
  \ same look in our eyes, it was this spark of excitement that mad men have. It wasn\u2019\
  t easy getting to the base of the hill with patch of jagged rocks which seemed like\
  \ the hill giving us a warning to stay back, the cold wind stinging our noses didn\u2019\
  t seem to help the situation either. The hill had a very steep climb and was most\
  \ just sand and shrubbery so there was nothing to make climbing easier for us. As\
  \ we went higher we felt the air getting thinner as it was getting hard to breathe.\
  \ We were almost there when Shaun started wheezing and told me he couldn\u2019t\
  \ go any further. At that point I had to take a decision, whether to go back down\
  \ with him or go all the way up. He saw this conflict on my face and made sure I\
  \ go to the top. As I gradually started increasing my pace, clawing through the\
  \ sand to find something to grab on to, I could see the top of the hill. As soon\
  \ as I got to the top, I knew I had made the right decision because standing 20\
  \ feet away from me was a one of the most beautiful creatures I\u2019ve seen, a\
  \ Tibetan wolf. It was just a brief moment as we both acknowledged each other\u2019\
  s presence and went our separate ways. My heart was beating the fastest it ever\
  \ had in my entire life the whole way down."
