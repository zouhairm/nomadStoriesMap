Text: "The first thing I ever saw was the ocean. That might explain why I feel so\
  \ confortable travelling by water. My mother and my father fell in love in a colony\
  \ far south in Patagonia where there is not much to do besides fishing, sailing\
  \ and swiming - although the ocean\u2019s temperature can get so low that I\u2019\
  ve actually seen waves freeze in mid air. That might seem extreme, but for a long\
  \ time it was all I knew.\nI felt cold, of course. That\u2019s why I am grateful\
  \ for having a loving mother who would cuddle me in the most dark days. She also\
  \ taught me how to fish. This activity guides our lives. Were the fish go, we go.\
  \ And that\u2019s how I begun to travel and know the world. One beautiful Autumn\
  \ morning, I set out on a voyage to track a school of anchovies. I was in the Malvinas\
  \ current when a big storm hit. Later, I\u2019d find out the storm is known as La\
  \ Ni\xF1a. \nI\u2019m not sure how I survived through the night. All I know is that\
  \ the next morning I was covered in oil and it made me very cold. My only hope was\
  \ to swim towards the shore to find shelter. That\u2019s how I ended up in Praia\
  \ Grande, Rio de Janeiro. \nAs I laid on the beach, the warm sand started to feel\
  \ as comfortable as my mother\u2019s lap. I was scared, but cozy. A few hours later\
  \ I was picked up and taken to a cool place where my rescuer gave me a refreshing\
  \ shower until there wasn\u2019t anymore oil on me. After that, he fed me and and\
  \ took me to his backyard where I slept the whole night. \nThe next morning he took\
  \ me to an island and left me there. He thought I wanted to leave, but that wasn\u2019\
  t on my plans. I swam back to the beach that same day and walked to his house. He\
  \ was so happy to see me, like I was his lost son. Soon we bonded and I learned\
  \ more about his life. His name is Jo\xE3o and like a lot of people from the Northeast\
  \ of Brazil, he left the Sert\xE3o looking for a job. He turned out to be a fantastic\
  \ bricklayer, at the price of leaving behind his son, who he hasn\u2019t been able\
  \ to contact since. He said he's now retired because he's weak. I didn\u2019t agree\
  \ with that - he always carries me around and even kicks out the stray dogs from\
  \ the beach so I can have a safe swim.\nAround Summer, it got too hot and I felt\
  \ it was time to go home. Since then, not a year goes by that I don\u2019t visit\
  \ Jo\xE3o. I\u2019d always think of love as an emotion that was unique to penguins,\
  \ but now I see that nature is much more intricate than I expected. Sometimes I\
  \ even think about stop eating fish, although I\u2019m not there yet."
