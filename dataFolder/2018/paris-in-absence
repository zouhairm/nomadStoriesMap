Text: "Quantifying the significance of a place to a person is a vague endeavor. Diameter,\
  \ area, and mass tell you little. Here I propose a different measurement: absence.\
  \ In qualifying how deeply a place is missed as well as the nature of that feeling\
  \ (heavy, joyful, nostalgic, etc.) one can arrive at a conclusion as to the significance\
  \ of the place. \n\nIn my travels, this is often felt most poignantly when looking\
  \ back at the shrinking topography of a beloved city from the window of the ascending\
  \ airplane. However, since this is being written pre-departure, it suffices to have\
  \ a weekend away from Paris in the French countryside. The drive was just as good\
  \ because the soft rumble of the highway and the landscape scrolling by are wonderful\
  \ catalysts for the stirring of dormant thoughts into clarity.\n      \nThe first\
  \ day away I was happy for the sound of birds and the calm of the country. That\
  \ night we found a restaurant that could hold our entire group of twelve at one\
  \ table and the food was moderately priced and had the fresh quality of being caught\
  \ and cooked locally. The second day we drove to Amboise and saw the Clos-Luce\u0301\
  \ where Da Vinci lived the last three years of his life. The air in his garden was\
  \ the purest air I can recall breathing in my life. Whether his genius or the air\
  \ came first cannot be determined, I could only note that there was a palpable superior\
  \ quality attached to this place.\n\nWalking through his garden, I was struck by\
  \ a transcendent sense of kinship: the feeling of existing on the same geographic\
  \ space as a mind that had done much to shape my own.\n\n An amazing property of\
  \ place is that if you hold one element constant, for example, geographic location,\
  \ then your mind can roam the entire spectrum of the other elements, such as time.\
  \ Standing in the Clos-Luce\u0301 looking at his notebooks there was suspension\
  \ of the fourth-dimensional wall, and in that visceral sight that is not done with\
  \ the eyes, I saw him there watching, thinking, creating.\n      \nOf course, transcendent\
  \ moments of recognition do not last forever because time will eventually move forward\
  \ in a three-dimensional world. So we made our way back to Paris, and when we saw\
  \ the Eiffel towering over the Parisian skyline, we said: \u201CLook, we\u2019re\
  \ home.\u201D And that was just as true. In her absence, I saw that Paris is an\
  \ impetus for creation and thought, and that time in the city and time out of it\
  \ were two necessary parts of a whole: to experience and to know."
