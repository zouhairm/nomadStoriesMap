Text: "Aglomerado da Serra, a Brazilian favela known worldwide for its violent background.\
  \ I was at my host school advertising an intramural-sports competition, when I suddenly\
  \ heard a couple of gunshots. BOOM! BOOM! Terrified, I froze in response to that\
  \ dreadful noise. I could see the halls being occupied by the scared students. Also\
  \ frightened, I looked inside the gymnasium, and there it was: a bloody body on\
  \ the floor. \nUnfortunately, the person lying dead was a student named Marcos,\
  \ who was likely shot due to his involvement with drug-trafficking. Even there,\
  \ while looking at Marcos\u2019s body on the cold hard ground, I started to reflect\
  \ on my role as a member of a suburban community, and to question \u201CWhy am I\
  \ having access to educational opportunities while my peers\u2019 lives are in danger?\u201D\
  \ I could not accept that the school environment turned into a civil-war scenario.\
  \ \nOne week after Marcos\u2019s homicide, I was listening to students\u2019 comments\
  \ regarding his death, and realized that they wanted to be aware of educational\
  \ opportunities. Inside the building, the beautiful graffiti artworks painted by\
  \ the talented student body contrasted with the dominating atmosphere of sadness.\
  \ However, one idea would incredibly change that situation: I suddenly remembered\
  \ of an abandoned sound-equipment. That is how a school radio station started, a\
  \ project that became a statewide initiative, which mobilized teachers, students,\
  \ and other school-workers to organize several activities such as food drives, knowledge\
  \ competitions, and music festivals.\nIn a matter of months, my host school was\
  \ leaving the worst moment of its history to overcome the difficulties and to be\
  \ recognized by the Federal University of Minas Gerais as the school that most promoted\
  \ extracurricular initiatives in 2014 across the entire state. Thus, the radio\u2019\
  s achievements were examples of how important it is to raise awareness about opportunities.\
  \ I learned that, even without proper resources, it is possible to turn traumatic\
  \ events into learning and development of the student body. \nHaving taken the decision\
  \ of establishing a school radio program pushed me to the edge of those lives around\
  \ me. From making me a transformative agent to impacting my world perspectives,\
  \ this national exchange experience became cinematic. But above all, it made me\
  \ eager to prove that anybody can belong anywhere regardless of where they come\
  \ from and that, therefore, an underprivileged person can have a different journey\
  \ than Marcos\u2019."
