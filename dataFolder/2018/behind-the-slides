Text: "\u2018Ing\xE5ng\u2019 says the sign, indicating the broken turnstiles and shuttered\
  \ ticket desk. This is the gateway to Fun City, in its heyday, \u2018Sweden\u2019\
  s funniest amusement park\u2019, now derelict, forgotten, and not quite abandoned.\n\
  \nBut at the turnstiles, we don\u2019t know that. To us, there\u2019s something\
  \ compelling about abandonment. It has its usual victims: factories when there\u2019\
  s nothing left to make, homes when there\u2019s no one there to live, metro stations\
  \ when the place to be is now somewhere else. But sometimes in its net it catches\
  \ something different, something like Fun City. One day, Fun City stopped being\
  \ fun. It lies before us now, frozen on that fateful day. \n\nWater must have been\
  \ the main draw. A huge pool, carpeted now with leaves, dominates the main park.\
  \ At its center is an island, plastic palm trees stretching skyward to the weak\
  \ Swedish sun. Broken loungers float in the pool, awkward like dead insects. The\
  \ changing rooms are all graffiti and broken shower heads, ancient fag butts refusing\
  \ to degrade in tiled corners. We head deeper. At the edges of the path, giant plastic\
  \ dinosaurs leer from the undergrowth, knee-high with weeds, perhaps more at home\
  \ now than they had been before. Fun can still be glimpsed here and there, at the\
  \ wheel of the dodgem cars, in the twisted chaos of the water slides, but there\u2019\
  s something obscene about Fun City\u2019s dereliction. It\u2019s strange to think\
  \ of fun as a commodity.\n\nIt\u2019s as we\u2019re leaving that we notice the people,\
  \ some way off between the trees. Skirting the perimeter fence, the road opens into\
  \ an expanse of wasteland, and before us lies the migrant camp.\n\nThere are perhaps\
  \ thirty or so dwellings in all, a mix of breeze block bunkers and holiday-type\
  \ cabins. Most have tarps slung across the door; sheets of corrugated tin patching\
  \ the roof. Men peer at us from within, smoking calmly as we drive through their\
  \ little village. We turn the music off. What do they think of us? Rarely have I\
  \ felt such a tourist. A huddle of children play football with bare feet as the\
  \ sun descends, the goal a pair of scrubby trees. It\u2019s a riot of football shirts\
  \ \u2013 two sport \u2018Ibrahimovic\u2019, both Barcelona and Milan. It's nearly\
  \ time for dinner, for a taste of an older home. Above the treetops, the apex of\
  \ the water slide swoons. \n\nIs this what lies beneath the carpet of the Nordic\
  \ model? We turn to leave Fun City. The kids don\u2019t bat an eyelid. Play hasn\u2019\
  t stopped for our pitch invasion."
