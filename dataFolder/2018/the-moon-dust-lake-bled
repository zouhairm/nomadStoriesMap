Text: "In 2011 I found a lump in my breast and I arranged a same day appointment at\
  \ the hospital.  The mammogram showed a small lump, so a biopsy was carried out.\
  \  The reality of what could be sunk in but even when it was found to be benign,\
  \ it pushed me to the edge.  I decided that I needed to travel the world and experience\
  \ all the food, aromas, people, myths and tribes; because we don't know when our\
  \ time is up.\n\nWhen our daughter voiced her desire to ski, Marrakech was postponed\
  \ and a new hunt was on.  The usual destinations were too much for our budget and\
  \ Slovenia popped up as a suggestion.  A country that once had an uncertain future\
  \ during the Balkan wars was now traversed for its glacial lakes, mountains and\
  \ ski resorts.  Lake Bled was featured and I knew this was our destination!  A shuttle\
  \ at Ljubljana airport took us directly to our hotel.  The hotel was basic; it echoed\
  \ a past without fineries but I am easily pleased by simply having what I need.\n\
  \nThen, there it was.  A view to behold.  The lake, pristine and placid, shimmering\
  \ like moon dust sprinkled in a fairy tale land.  \n\nAs both my daughter and I\
  \ had never skied before, we arranged lessons the following day.  We caught a minibus\
  \ that took us through the winding road of the Triglav National Park, across bridges\
  \ and towns with snow neatly swept to the sides.  We acquired the day passes, boarded\
  \ the Gondola lift and ascended to Vogel Ski Resort, 1922 meters up.  Ski boots\
  \ hired, skis fitted.  Nope.  \n\nMy legs refused and this alien feeling was disconcerting\
  \ so I waited for my instructor.  He was cool, gave me a high five and said that\
  \ the net at the bottom would do nothing if I took a tumble.  He was honest.  I\
  \ appreciate that so when he said he won\u2019t let that happen, I believed him.\
  \  Half hour later I was skiing down a slope on my own!  I didn\u2019t even stop\
  \ when my daughter fell into a ditch.  Ok, I tried but couldn\u2019t.  Ha!  She\
  \ was assisted quickly by staff.  I felt accomplished and being surrounded by phenomenal\
  \ views of the National Park and Lake Bohinj below was surreal.  My mind fluttered\
  \ back momentarily to Trinidad, where I grew up; equal in beauty but so different.\n\
  \nThe following morning, we headed out to Lake Bled.  We took a Pletna boat to the\
  \ Gothic church on the islet and in the evening, walked up the winding path to the\
  \ castle on the cliff to explore Slovenia\u2019s past.\n\nThree days had passed\
  \ and we returned to London.  I will absolutely return because they\u2019ve got\
  \ paragliding in summer!"
