Text: "Plunging down the river bank, the four-wheel-drive Toyota Hilux forged the\
  \ raging Les Anglais, the last of many rivers between us and our destination, Tiburon,\
  \ a remote village on Haiti's southern peninsula. Our driver followed intrepid teens\
  \ pointing out where we could cross without being swept away\n  To backtrack, after\
  \ arriving in Port-Au-Prince, we caught a prop plane (a salvaged WWII relic) to\
  \ Les Cayes. Though the last leg of the journey was only 40 miles, our odyssey up,\
  \ down and around treacherous mountain terrain took five hours\n Upon arriving,\
  \ we showered in unexpectedly cold water, a welcome relief from the sweltering Caribbean\
  \ heat. We bunked in classrooms, on beds that church members donated for our comfort.\
  \ Our host jokingly said, \"Not to worry; any tarantulas we may encounter will be\
  \ more afraid of you.\" Yeah, try sleeping with that thought. \n  The Creole diet\
  \ consists mostly beans and rice, a bland breadfruit porridge and tropical fruit,\
  \ and sometimes crappie fish, but rarely can Haitians afford meat. Since we were\
  \ guests, they treated us to goat stew, pork, and jerk chicken.\n As we strolled\
  \ around the village, we were followed by dozens of children with bloated bellies,\
  \ barefoot and wearing rags, yet their smiles and laughter suggested they were unaware\
  \ of their poverty. As an overweight American, I felt intensely guilty and ashamed.\
  \ \n  Many houses were in disrepair from fierce Caribbean hurricanes; quite a few\
  \ shacks were nothing more than sticks and a tarp roof. Fortunately, the afternoon\
  \ rain was good cover for our tears of despair. \n As if on cue, our guide told\
  \ us a fable about a little boy who wanted to save millions of starfish that washed\
  \ ashore after a storm. A bystander chided, \"Silly boy; you can't save those millions\
  \ of starfish.\" As he tossed each starfish into the sea, the boy declared, \"I\
  \ saved that one, and that one, and that one.\" That's when we realized that what\
  \ little help we were here to offer was better than doing nothing at all.  \n  Part\
  \ of our mission was to hang commercial-grade exterior ceiling fans with lights\
  \ in the sanctuary, and ten classrooms. That night when the switch was turned on,\
  \ a pleasant breeze filled the space and I was reminded, \"God said, let there be\
  \ light and the light was good.\" \n Before we knew it, our journey was over, and\
  \ sadly it was time to leave our new friends. The last thing I had expected from\
  \ being among with the poorest of the poor was that I would come away richer for\
  \ the experience."
