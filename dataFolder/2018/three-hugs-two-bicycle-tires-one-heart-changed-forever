Text: "I\u2019m walking. Sweat drips out of my every pore as the Nicaraguan summer\
  \ sun beats down with a beautiful fury. My fingers tangled in flip flops, I carefully\
  \ trek barefoot through the salty mud, avoiding broken beer bottles and whatever\
  \ the local dogs left behind, swatting annoying mosquitoes incessantly attacking\
  \ every inch of my skin. I couldn\u2019t be happier. \n\nWith lungs full of sea\
  \ air I wander through the local village of Puerto Sandino, pondering my reason\
  \ for existence, thinking about my afternoon siesta in my favorite purple hammock,\
  \ and taking visual snapshots of every inch of this hidden gem of a place. \n\n\
  Then... \u201CHola gringa! Hehehe.\u201D Cute faces and chuckles fill my heart with\
  \ instant joy. A moment of reflection momentarily rushes over me as my Mexican heritage\
  \ is obviously disguised by my Billabong shorts, Volcom tank top, and blonde hair\
  \ long enough to rival Rapunzel. I don\u2019t belong here. But these insanely adorable\
  \ little creatures insist on playing and teasing. I\u2019m so game. \n\nThey duck\
  \ down behind a tiny wall, barely peeking around the side, ready for hide and seek.\
  \ \u201CHola chiquitas! Donde Est\xE1n?\u201D(Where are you?) Thirty seconds go\
  \ by. Uh-oh. I assume I scared them once I spoke, so I slowly start to walk ahead\
  \ then all of the sudden, \u201CAqu\xED! Aqu\xED!\u201D (Here! Here!) Arms are waving\
  \ as they rush out to the road, local dogs start barking, and the tiny one is pushing\
  \ an oversized bicycle through what seems to be the gate to their humble abode.\
  \ \n\nShe passes the bike to her older sister and gives me a hug like I\u2019m her\
  \ favorite teddy bear. I melt. She then takes my wrist with her muddy fingers and\
  \ drags it to what I notice to be a loose chain. The \u201Chelp me because I\u2019\
  m so cute\u201D trick is working, and I am the sucker. \n\n\u201CAriela, no no no,\u201D\
  \ the older ones scolds and without hesitation, I express to her in my foreign dialect\
  \ Spanish that I used to have this problem all the time and will gladly fix it up.\
  \ Smiles. But confusion. \u201CUn momento, bellas.\u201D I got this, little ones.\
  \ \n\nI ask them their names as I kneel in the absolutely disgusting muck to (hopefully)\
  \ fix what is evidently their only bicycle. Ariela, the young sassy one, Vanelita,\
  \ the shy middle one who doesn\u2019t trust this crazy stranger...which I can appreciate,\
  \ and Naomi, the oldest and naturally protective one...all so beautiful, so pure\
  \ of heart, so...damn...innocent. \n\n\u201CLo arregl\xE9!\u201D I fixed it. Bombarded\
  \ with three gigantic hugs, a tear creeps into my eye. I changed their day, and\
  \ they changed my life."
