Text: "Featherston\u2019s iconic Royal hotel reopened its doors last December after\
  \ two years of intensive renovations. Conveniently situated for travellers in New\
  \ Zealand\u2019s scenic Wairarapa region, the Royal\u2019s boutique accommodation\
  \ is worthy of being a tourist destination in its own right.\n\nBuilt in 1868 the\
  \ Royal has been the principal hotel and social hub of Featherston; a much-loved\
  \ local over the years. After being destroyed in a fire in 1893 it was rebuilt and\
  \ remained largely unchanged until its new owners, Rob Allen and Janelle Harrington,\
  \ gave it its latest makeover.\n\nThe hotel has been restored to its Victorian glory\
  \ with rooms sumptuously decorated with furnishings of the time. A steampunk flavour\
  \ has been added with whimsical features such as glass cabinets filled with antique\
  \ scientific instruments, wash basins mounted on re-purposed vintage treadle sewing\
  \ machine bases, porcelain lavatories with real pull chains and exposed convoluted\
  \ copper plumbing, and even a taxidermy animal or two. The luxurious beds are laid\
  \ with piles of pillows, cushions and faux fur throws just begging you to sink into\
  \ them.\n\nEach room is unique, each themed with a personality or fictional character\
  \ of the period. You can spend a night in the Jules Verne room or follow the footsteps\
  \ of M\u0101ori women's suffrage campaigner, in the Meri Te Tai Mangak\u0101hia\
  \ room. \n\nYou might feel you\u2019ve stepped back in time, but you won\u2019t\
  \ be missing out on the modern conveniences. The rooms are equipped with large flat\
  \ screen TVs, free Wi-Fi, electric blankets, hairdryers and the usual tea/coffee-making\
  \ facilities, though you may have to look for them as they\u2019re tastefully hidden\
  \ amongst the old books with worn spines, vintage typewriters and other curiosities.\
  \ \n\nYou don\u2019t go to the Royal to check in, drop your bags and head out all\
  \ hours of the day. This hotel is for \u2018staying in\u2019. Come in winter when\
  \ the cold rainy weather gives you an excuse not to go sightseeing. Bring your favourite\
  \ novel, preferably one set in the 19th or early 20th century, and indulge in late\
  \ morning lie-ins reading under the cosy covers while you lose yourself in your\
  \ book and the fantastical world of your surroundings. Spend afternoons lazing sipping\
  \ cappuccinos in front of the roaring fireplace in the lounge, and in the evening\
  \ when you head down to dinner, you may even be lucky enough to spot a Victorian\
  \ apparition at the end of the lamp-lit corridor."
