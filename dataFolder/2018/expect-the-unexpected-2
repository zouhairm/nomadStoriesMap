Text: "All of us worked with expectations, big or small, they exist in any and every\
  \ human being. In particular, my expectations are based on the closest to reality,\
  \ in which I know it's possible. This is no different when I travel, but, of course,\
  \ every has its special place that gives us more than we expect. One example was\
  \ when I travelled to Penedo - AL, a city rich in history, culture and natural beauty.\
  \ The city of Penedo, have a great importance for the history of Brazil. But what\
  \ impressed me most, that I didn't expect was the beautiful view to the famous S\xE3\
  o Francisco River. It is to fill the eyes, the beautiful sunshine resting in the\
  \ river, bringing a brightness and peace to anyone who sees it. Another example\
  \ was in Foz do Igua\xE7u, in Parque das Aves, I fell in love with the structure\
  \ and the beautiful animals that dwelt there. Since butterflies to toucans. It was\
  \ an incredible experience that they didn't expect to live. An example of things\
  \ that i didn't expect a trip with respect to contact with people, was the way people\
  \ in each city, region and country behave in different ways and many times without\
  \ holding the essential good 24. When traveling to a congress in S\xE3o Paulo, had\
  \ counted with several people from all over the country, and even to the continent.\
  \ The majority of them, with whom I had contact, showed, in addition to curious\
  \ about my culture, interest in knowing how was my town, my morals, typical food,\
  \ without prejudices or disdain. This change was made in a fun and extremely enriching.\
  \ There are still thousands of experiences to be lived and places to impress me,\
  \ but i always make to expect the unexpected."
