Text: "We set sail at midnight, from the ragged Ionian coastline, into royal blue\
  \ and darkness. We\u2019re headed for a tiny island, to meet a monk who has lived\
  \ there, for 30 years, alone. \n\nIt\u2019s hot as hell, even at this late hour.\
  \ As we pass through the open mouth of the bay, an embrace of relief strikes us,\
  \ the salt air - cutting through oppressive heat. Without warning, I am in the grips\
  \ of a seasick migraine. \n\n\u201CHere,\u201D Vasili says, handing me a dry chalky\
  \ chewable tab about the size of a dollar, \u201CTake this.\u201D \n\n\u201CWhat\
  \ is it?\u201D I ask. Chrissa is shooing me, gesturing \u2018just take it, you idiot.\u2019\
  \ \n\nAs the pill takes effect, or the dreamy sleeplessness overcomes me, hours\
  \ pass. I begin to see Visions in the waves. Great rising cities, their columns\
  \ evaporating in mist and salt and ocean sound. \n\n\u201CAre you seeing this?\u201D\
  \ I reel, to my 70 year old smoking partner Vasili, as he taps his cigarette in\
  \ the spinning whiz-click ash-tray designed for sea faring. \u201COh yeah\u201D\
  \ he drawls, eyes fixed at sea. \n\nChrissa joins us, above deck, while the others\
  \ sleep below. For twenty minutes now, we\u2019ve been watching a confusing smattering\
  \ of lights approaching, and disappearing, the reds and greens of silent communication\
  \ failing us. Is it a container ship? Which way is it going? \n\nChrissa and Vasili\
  \ are parents to our friend, Gena. She\u2019s asleep below, with her husband. my\
  \ own partner, fast asleep at the other end of the boat. \nVasili and Chrissa bicker,\
  \ all in Greek- warm, like a crackling fire. I sit quietly, smoking in the back.\
  \ As we peer and squint at the vessel ahead, the metal rings on the ropes of our\
  \ boat sing out, in the wind and blackness. \n\nThen, all in a terrifying millisecond,\
  \ we are facing death. The container ship is a cruise ship now in focus, charging\
  \ at us with stunning speed and ferocity. We can hear the waves slapping against\
  \ its ten storey wall, see figures in the balconies, staring down at us.\n\nChrissa\
  \ and Vassili, sweating through their shirts, fall into a language of war: two admirals,\
  \ ordering each other in their mother tongue across the wet deck, raging desperately\
  \ to correct our path. In the fury of it, time stops. There is beauty, in the urgent\
  \ synchronicity of their movement. In a split second, the ship cuts a turn and blazes\
  \ away from us, a deafening horn blaring, our survival. We laugh and shout at each\
  \ other in terrible joy\u2026fear still alive in our bodies. \n\nHours later we\
  \ made landfall at Strofades, climbing up the sharp rocks to find its lone occupant."
