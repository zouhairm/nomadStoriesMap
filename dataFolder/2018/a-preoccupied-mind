Text: "Vlad was the first guy on earth I was aware of who looked at me for more than\
  \ ten seconds. He has a regular Slavic appearance: pinkish-white skin color, sharp\
  \ nose with a roundish tip, thin lips and grey eyes. The attractive part was that\
  \ talking to him was full of jokes but ended up pushing my mind work hard.\n\n\u201C\
  You are a nice girl. How you don\u2019t have any boyfriend?\u201D Vlad wondered\
  \ after I asked if he wants to move to talk noticing that he was rubbing his feet\
  \ from the mosquito bites. I had almost all of my body covered, except for my feet,\
  \ face, and hands. He, on the other hand, was wearing short sleeve shirt, short\
  \ pants, and flip-flops. He had so many available spots for the mosquitos to attack.\
  \ \n\nI also felt a bit insecure being alone with him in the dark and in a hidden\
  \ spot on top of some rocks by the beach in Miami. The insecurity feeling grew but\
  \ spending time with him at friend\u2019s beach party earlier gave me some confidence\
  \ that he knows how to handle a girl in a proper manner. We decided to stay there\
  \ sharing the space with the mosquitos.\n\nThe far road light helped me see his\
  \ face that was waiting for my answer. I hate his question, but it wasn\u2019t easy\
  \ for me to say it as it was.\nBeing told as a nice girl doesn\u2019t sound complimentary\
  \ to me. It won\u2019t win my heart. Well, maybe Vlad didn\u2019t mean to get it\
  \ anyways. I might say I don\u2019t do dating as I am a hardcore Muslim when it\
  \ comes to it. An idea to say, \u201Cso do you want to be my boyfriend?\u201D also\
  \ popped up in my head, but it ended up unspoken. It was hard to gulp my saliva\
  \ and I wasn\u2019t ready to hear his answer anyways. \n\nFinally, I said that I\
  \ don\u2019t feel I need a guy at the moment.\n\nHe nodded, being kind, and put\
  \ his cigarettes on. Relieved.\n\nWe said nothing for a few seconds enjoying the\
  \ city night light at a distance. The soothing wind came from the sea touching our\
  \ faces friendly. No dramatic wave sound appeared. From the edge of one of my eyes,\
  \ I could feel someone was staring at me for a long time. He loved to mess with\
  \ my head. Why are you looking at me that way?! \n\nVlad recognized that I was having\
  \ a gesture of thinking.\n\n\u201CWhat do you have in mind?\u201D he asked with\
  \ a gentle and quick tapping of my hands that were moving slightly on top of my\
  \ knees.  Damn, what should I say? I was struggling to keep a poker face naturally,\
  \ \u201COh, well, I was thinking about the situation in Russia. Have you ever heard\
  \ about the telegram case?\u201D At that time really Vlad, I\u2019d rather have\
  \ you attack me directly."
