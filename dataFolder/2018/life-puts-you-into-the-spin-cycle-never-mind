Text: "Warmth, sun and surf were the three decisive criteria for our holiday during\
  \ last year\u2019s autumn. My boyfriend and I found all of them in Morocco. But\
  \ thanks to our local surf instructor and guide Abdullah (\u201CAbdu\u201D) we also\
  \ took with us a beautiful memory that will last in our hearts. \n\nApart from helping\
  \ us improve our surf skills, Abdu showed us amazing places in the surroundings\
  \ and, last but not least, the patisseries shop with the best avocado milkshake\
  \ in town. \n\nBut Abdu, who had chosen to live from his passion of surfing over\
  \ a contract as a marine engineer, also gave us an understanding of letting go,\
  \ accepting to subordinate to nature and higher power. \u201CAbdu, will you take\
  \ us to amazing waves tomorrow?\u201D \u2013 \u201CInshallah.\u201D\n\nThe most\
  \ inspiring thing, however, he said completely randomly, without any intention of\
  \ sounding philosophical. \n\nOur group was taking a break from surfing on the beach,\
  \ sipping fresh sugared mint tea and enjoying caramelised peanuts while sharing\
  \ our surf experiences. The discussion revolved around that part when you fall from\
  \ the board into the water, get submerged and spun around by the wave \u2013 the\
  \ wave you wanted take in the first place but which eventually took you. It\u2019\
  s an often-occurring phenomenon, found with beginners as well with advanced surfers,\
  \ in insider circles also referred to as the \u201Cwashing machine\u201D. \n\nAbdu\
  \ said, smiling: \u201CWhen I come into the washing machine, I really don\u2019\
  t mind that at all. I have absolutely no problem with that.\u201D\n\nThat sentence\
  \ got stuck in my head. I always saw this experience as something unpleasant \u2013\
  \ well, it IS kind of unpleasant if you are pushed under water, turned around, salty\
  \ water entering your nose and mouth while you\u2019re wondering where the top and\
  \ where the bottom is \u2013 as something that must be avoided, a failure and disappointment\
  \ that costs you energy. But hearing Adbu saying this in such a good-humoured way\
  \ made me change my point of view. Missing your wave and falling from the board\
  \ is entirely part of the experience. \n\nNeedless to say that all this does not\
  \ only apply to surf lessons.  \n\nLife won\u2019t always treat you as gentle hand\
  \ wash. Being in troubled water is part of the game. You struggle and sometimes\
  \ you can\u2019t even breathe anymore. But also try to be grateful that you can\
  \ live through all the facets of it. Be present in every up and down \u2013 embrace\
  \ the full experience with all the aspects that become part of you and that make\
  \ you catch your next perfect wave."
