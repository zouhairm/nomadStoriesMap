Text: "We were a bit stressed after our adventure in Ha Long Bay. Located in north\
  \ west of Vietnam this area is part of Unesco Heritage. From one side, as a dream\
  \ coming true, and on the other hand, the representation of how awful is becoming\
  \ a popular place. I\u2019m sorry for all those that are reading it and you loved\
  \ Ha Long Bay, or for those that you are looking forward to go there, but for me\
  \ it was not our best stop in Vietnam. Unfortunately, Ha Long bay has become an\
  \ area that has to be restricted for the government in order to avoid the multitudes.\
  \ \nFollowing our trip to south we took a train to Ninh Binh. A friends recommended\
  \ to go to Tam Coc. As soon as we arrived at the train station and took a taxi,\
  \ we realized that we weren\u2019t definitely in the most picturesque town. Till\
  \ the moment, our travel had had the requests that an european expect of being in\
  \ Asia; the chaos from the city, the green rice fields from the north (and also\
  \ the rain) and the sun and humidity from the weird and spectacular Asian sea. Honestly,\
  \ we expected little from centre of Vietnam.     \nOnce we arrived, we got something\
  \ to eat while planning where to go next. Even if the english from the owners was\
  \ simple and difficult to understand, they were the kindest people we came across\
  \ with. While we ate, by the way, one of the best places we ate! Sorry about that,\
  \ I must say it. Simply and spectacular home-made tasty food. I\u2019ll carry on;\
  \ while we were eating they explained us about the region and give us a paper map\
  \ with the most popular places and pagodas around. They also recommended us to take\
  \ a bike. For us, the next days were the most marvellous we spend in Vietnam. We\
  \ felt as relaxed as being in a known place as far as excited for being in a completely\
  \ unknown and different one from our culture. We took our bikes and cycled around\
  \ the green rice fields. While foreigners went to Tam Coc, we enjoyed the most peaceful\
  \ and local outgoing. We went to Trang An and spent a morning in a regional attraction.\
  \ We shared a canoe with an old Vietnamese man from the south. He was such happy\
  \ to share one with foreigners, that gave us ginger candies, cigarettes and took\
  \ selfies with us to show them around. Three hours sailing and visiting hiding pagodas\
  \ in the middle of nothing. \nBeing in a homestay, far from tourist region, cycling\
  \ without direction and grabbing a Bia Hoi in the low blue plastic stools close\
  \ to the river, was definitely the best way of experienced the real Vietnamese life."
