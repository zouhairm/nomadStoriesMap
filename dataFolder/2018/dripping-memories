Text: "We were the 5 of us, my friends and I.\nWe were on the roof, close to the sky,\
  \ up above the teeming and sparkling alleys in Marrakech.\nThat day had been as\
  \ the others in our trip, filled with joy, laughter and feelings that let us with\
  \ the heart crawling with pure happiness.\nBut that night was slightly different:\
  \ it was our last night together, our time was running out and we all felt it on\
  \ our bones, with light melancholy.\nWe had ran away from the city\u2019s excitement,\
  \ we had slipped away from stalls and snake charmers, we had ignored the rhythms\
  \ intriguing our ears and the smells whetting our appetite.\nWe had jumped over\
  \ all the thousands possible adventures and we had found refuge on the terrace of\
  \ our hostel.\nWe chose our peace, we decided to scoff our lasts moments, savouring\
  \ everything and trying not to forget anything of those unspeakable days.\nJust\
  \ the five of us.\nAnd our feelings.\nAnd our travel diary, where we wrote almost\
  \ everything that had happened to us.\nAnd we spent our lasts hours in Marrakech\
  \ reading that booklet over and over.\nWe laughed thinking about the silly and foolish\
  \ stuff we made, we felt once again on our fingers the coarse coat of the cammels\
  \ we rode and we smelled their whiff. We remembered all the stunning sunsets we\
  \ saw: the funniest one, climbed up on some palm trees, and the wettest one, swimming\
  \ in the Atlantic Ocean. We pointed out our nights in the tents, the coldest, on\
  \ the top of the Atlas mountains, and the one in which we didn\u2019t sleep at all,\
  \ in the middle of nowhere, somewhere between the desert and the ocean.\nWe got\
  \ emotional, reading the poems we wrote honouring the constellations, our guides\
  \ mile after mile.\nAnd we recollected all the brighting, countless, dazzling stars\
  \ we tried to count in the sky above the Sahara desert.\nAnd our stomaches ached.\n\
  So we took a deep breath and with the last spirit, with a few, slow, caresses, we\
  \ wished ourselves good journeys sailing the dream\u2019s seas.\nOnce I touched\
  \ my dense mattress I found myself dreaming about my long, speedy run along the\
  \ edge of the Ocean. And while I was running as fast as I could to the rising Moon,\
  \ something woke me up: my feet were wet. It was not the salty water of the ocean:\
  \ it was raining on my bed! I was in Marrakech, I was in Africa!, and it was raining!\
  \ The last thing that I expected! I quietly went back on the roof.\nThe entire city\
  \ was sleeping.\nThat rainy african night was made for me.\nFor the astonishing\
  \ trip I lived.\nFor my feeling nothing but bliss."
