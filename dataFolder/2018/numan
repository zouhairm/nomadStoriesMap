Text: "I met Numan only a couple days after I arrived in the West Bank.\nThe words\
  \ \u201COne wall, two jails\u201D I had a glimpse of while crossing the border were\
  \ still burning in the back of my mind. However, the park where people were leisurely\
  \ hanging about that day didn\u2019t feel like a jail at all. It was a cold but\
  \ sunny day, and children were laughing and running around an ancient and splendid\
  \ amphitheatre casually standing there.\n\_\nNot much had to be said between us\
  \ before the connection was established. From then on, I got to explore Nablus through\
  \ his eyes. I discovered the other meaningful traces of the past that appeared now\
  \ and then, in the middle of refugee camps, chaotic streets, crowded roads and people\
  \ living on despite the occupation. He introduced me to them and taught me their\
  \ language. I tasted their hospitality while laughing loudly and crying silently\
  \ as I listened to their stories.\n\_\nI fell in love with both Numan and Nablus,\
  \ and I could have easily drifted in the warmth of those feelings if it wasn\u2019\
  t for the reality checks I was regularly subjected to: gunshots at night, news of\
  \ another destroyed house, or one of my friends' childhood stories, filled with\
  \ tanks, explosions and fear.\n\_\nHorror cohabited with the simple joys of life.\
  \ During our explorations, he took me to the mountains and their symbolic olive\
  \ trees. As we took in the view, he told me about the Samaritans living there, and\
  \ how they all cohabited in harmony. It felt like peace didn\u2019t have to be just\
  \ a myth.\n\nHe told me about Joseph\u2019s Tomb and how it is sacred for some,\
  \ even though locals believed it was only the tomb of poor old Joseph, who died\
  \ a few decades ago. When his friend got shot next to it, Numan showed me how strong\
  \ one must be to still choose love over hate in such a place. \n\nAnd he always\
  \ did. Despite all of the pain, he listened to me when I told him stories about\
  \ the other side. He believed me when I said that things were not black or white,\
  \ that there were good people there too, some who also chose love over hate. \n\_\
  \nHe inspired me. Our laughter transcended the cultural barriers and the immense\
  \ gap between us, dug by my privilege and his lack of freedom.\n\_\nI sure didn\u2019\
  t expect to fall in love in Palestine, but the last thing I expected was that Numan\
  \ would not be here anymore to read this. I have accepted that, though, because\
  \ I know he is freer now than he ever would have been in Nablus.\nAnd he finally\
  \ gets to travel, because I take him with me wherever I go."
