Text: "It was during phase of my life, where I was finding my purpose of life in the\
  \ bustle of earning my living & committing my time to my family, that I saw a glimpse\
  \ of life saving boat when my friend asked me to join a trek up the Great Kashmir\
  \ Lakes. The Kashmir which is the north most state of India boarding Pakistan &\
  \ China and always in boil of violence by war & terror attacks. I took a decision\
  \ that changes my way of life and pushed me to the edge.We arrived at Srinagar,\
  \ capital of Kashmir, the valley was just quite with heavy guarding by the army,\
  \ as today was the day buran wani, an militant was killed exactly a year before.\
  \ In midst of tension, we could not stop to notice and cherish the beauty of the\
  \ valley. We were expecting our trek to get cancelled due to the forecast of violence\
  \ eruption, luckily, we were able to peacefully make our journey to the 1st base\
  \ camp of trek to Kashmir great lakes. The chills from the winds kissed by the snow\
  \ capped mountains struck my marrows, to be realised that, yes!, I am here, camping\
  \ next to the Sindh river at an altitude of 7,800 ft. Well rested we left to nichnai\
  \ base camp climbing the mountains along the meadows where maple & pine trees starts.\
  \ A carpet of green rools down the meadows and crossing a height of 11,500 ft. Early\
  \ in the morning, before the sun shines, the lake starts getting its colours when\
  \ the sun shines. On a clear sunny morning, the water is absolutely blue. Clouds\
  \ and the evening sun make it look greenish blue in the later half of the day. Whatever\
  \ be the colour, the lake looks wonderful and it is worth catching a glimpse of\
  \ the lake in all its hues.The view of the twin lakes lasts till you reach the ridge\
  \ top or the Pass. This is called the Gadsar pass \u2013 altitude 13,800 ft \u2013\
  \ the highest point on this trek. The trek is a steep 2 hour ascent followed by\
  \ a steep descent followed by a gentle walk in the meadows. On the other side of\
  \ the Gadsar pass stretches a long valley with 2-3 small lakes visible.Satsar is\
  \ actually a collection of 7 lakes. You can find 4 or 5 lakes with water, depending\
  \ on the season. Beyond the ridge, on the right, is the Satsar army check post.\
  \ It is the 3rd\_line of defence from the LOC. \n\nComing down the mountains was\
  \ the most difficult thing, not because of the decent, but the nostalgic feeling\
  \ of leaving this beautiful place behind, the heart just don't want to leave this\
  \ place, its a feeling like no other I experience before, which I later realized\
  \ as LOVE."
