Text: "Surfers hotter than the sun, soft sand, beaches that heal body and soul, two\
  \ girls and one destination - Sagres, the number one surfing spot in Portugal. We\
  \ decided that it would be too boring to sleep in a hostel. We have sleeping bags,\
  \ so what do we need beds for? Why sleep under a roof when you can fall asleep under\
  \ the stars?\nWe couldn\u2019t wait to be woken up by the tender morning sun together\
  \ with the dancing wind, the idea was just irresistible. Until a good-natured bartender\
  \ told us about a recent robbery and violence. His horror stories sounded unbelievable\
  \ and foolish but planted doubts inside our adventurous, romantic souls. Suddenly,\
  \ the roof and beds seemed just perfect. We agreed to let the red wine decide for\
  \ us and ended up wandering the streets at midnight, desperately looking for a hostel\
  \ or someone crazy enough to let us sleep in their backyard. After calling random\
  \ numbers found while googling accommodation and knocking on countless doors, our\
  \ only option seemed to be a hotel way over our humble budget. Sadly enough, the\
  \ receptionist took great pleasure in kicking us out. Tired, discouraged and annoyed,\
  \ we stopped outside to sit on the stairs. There were two people with cups in their\
  \ hands, chatting and laughing. A tall, black guy in a light-colored suit with a\
  \ warm smile on his face looked like a giant standing next to a tiny, British-looking\
  \ man. Shortly after, they found out about our situation and immediately offered\
  \ to help. A profound feeling of happiness and gratitude filled my whole body as\
  \ I was lying on their couch, trying not to laugh. We accepted being homeless for\
  \ the night and ten minutes later, we're sharing a room with a Scottish guy, his\
  \ daughter and her boyfriend. Kind-hearted and compassionate people, happily and\
  \ selflessly helping others, do exist. Sometimes you just need a little reminder\
  \ and I cannot imagine a more enjoyable way than this.\nThanks to this experience,\
  \ Sagres will always hold a special place in my heart. It's located on the very\
  \ west of Europe and often described as a place with an end-of-the-world feel. It\u2019\
  s not the prettiest town that I\u2019ve seen, that's for sure. The atmosphere, however,\
  \ is something you\u2019ll never forget. The chill vibe that just makes you love\
  \ life is addictive. You might not feel it immediately, but trust me, it will get\
  \ to you. And you will just want to stay. Like Felix, a German guy who gave us surfing\
  \ lessons. He came, fell in love with the place, bought a van, and never left."
