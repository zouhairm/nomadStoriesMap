Text: 'Only 2 couples..planning our first international visit and we settle down to
  Thailand..Swasdee Kha...

  The day I landed in Thailand with my husband and a couple..I knew that I am gonna
  love this place.A warm welcome by the cabbie..an early morning arrival enroute to
  Bangkok to fly to Phuket..the journey started in a smooth flow.

  We had booked a hotel in Patong area as we had heard and read a lot on Google about
  it.We had 4 nights here and we were eagerly waiting for each moment henceforth.On
  the first evening we went to see the amazing Fantasea show.We had never seen such
  kind and we found the one hour play just superb. But the rest of shops and games
  were highly priced.On return we got ourselves dropped on the world famous Walking
  Street on Bangla Road.I had never known that how touchy that place was.I and my
  friend were a bit uneasy at the start coz to see semi nudes and nudes too at such
  a less distance is not which we see on a regular occasion.Our husbands kept on telling
  us "Gurls get used to this place..it''s our home for 3 more coming nights"..It wasn''t
  that easy coz those girls would look us also with wanting eyes..ewwww..But we visited
  some wonderful go go bars..specially the one I can''t get off my mind was the Russian
  bar " Moulin Rouge". Such a delight to watch those pole dances..the night went on
  for us ..laughing and giggling.It had become a routine for us to walk to and fro
  between hotel and Bangla road..and every walk we had was filled with so many talks
  planning gs..laughs..we were so carefree without a niche to worry abt kids.

  Next two days we had our bookings done for Island tours on speedboat of James Bond
  and next the Phi Phi and Maya Bay. Those aqua blue water,mountains,caves and white
  sand is what I took back from Phuket.I had never in my life had seen such serene
  places.We did snorkeling,diving,canoeing and walking around the islands.

  Thailand offers you some great choices on fruits and food too if u are sea food
  lover. The third fourth day we rented bikes so that we could have a city tour and
  view some more outstanding places of Phuket.So,we went to The Big Buddha and the
  famous Promthep Cape and in between few beaches too.The roads were very clean and
  well maintained.We came around Karom Beach Area on our return to hotel and that
  was some place to stay when I come back to Phuket with kids.To sum up our night
  outs we visited the best night club "Illuzion" and that was a night to remember
  for long, loud nonstop music & dancing to core.'
