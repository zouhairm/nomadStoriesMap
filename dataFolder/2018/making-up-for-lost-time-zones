Text: "When my (ex)boyfriend and I set off into paradise, I didn't think I'd spend\
  \ much time in solitude\u2026that is until Day 2, when he decided to see different\
  \ people.\nSo I decided to see a different country.\nDespite the rush of adrenaline\
  \ that pushed me to book a next-day flight from Fiji to Australia, now that I was\
  \ aboard and it was real, I felt terrified to explore the unknown alone.\n\"Sorry\
  \ - I think I'm the window.\"\nMy self-doubt was interrupted by a British girl with\
  \ burgundy braids shuffling into the vacant seat.\n\"Are you solo traveling too?\"\
  \nI nodded, still surprised myself. During the flight, we shared stories: I detailed\
  \ the Fiji fiasco that now found me alone and abroad, and she gushed over the dozen\
  \ places she's visited solo. Her infectious excitement quickly erased my fears.\n\
  \"You're gonna have a hard time feeling heartbroken here.\"\nMelbourne proved that\
  \ to be beyond true.\nSpecifically a dream drive - the Great Ocean Road, a 151-mile\
  \ coastal scenic stretch. To my left, emerald waters glistened under a cloudless\
  \ sky, while my right showcased seaside cities between the lush greenery of Great\
  \ Otway National Park.\nI felt nothing but freedom.\nToo elated from the high for\
  \ sleep, I drove through the night to the 12 Apostles and waited for dawn.\nDistant\
  \ clouds twisted into gray ribbons, broken by the striking glow of rising rays.\
  \ I followed the sun as it aligned with the eye of a massive slab of limestone and\
  \ gleamed like it was threading a needle.\nI thought about my last evening in Fiji,\
  \ sitting alone on the shore, soaking up the setting sun as it painted the horizon\
  \ in thick streaks of burnt oranges and reds. Soon the fire was lost in the darkness,\
  \ and I was just as empty and colorless as that starless sky.\nIt wasn't until now,\
  \ as the sun drenched the world in gold, that I came to appreciate just how vibrant\
  \ endings can be. Without the fall of night, there would be no brilliance in the\
  \ rise of day.\nI took my time driving to the airport, reluctant to be welcomed\
  \ back to reality. As I boarded the plane, I felt my stomach drop. But it wasn't\
  \ until I watched the ground disappear beneath a curtain of clouds that leaving\
  \ hit me.\nI missed it before I was gone.\nI never knew anywhere could capture my\
  \ heart like Australia did until I felt an ache in my chest by the half that stayed\
  \ behind. And as empty as it is to have a part of me waiting on the other side of\
  \ the globe, it's one hell of a feeling to know you can love something so much to\
  \ have its absence hurt so bad."
