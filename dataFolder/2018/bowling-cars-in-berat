Text: "Most Americans don\u2019t have the luxury of going abroad for more than a week\
  \ or two, if at all.  Travelling for longer, every activity isn\u2019t the make\
  \ or break experience of your vacation.  You can afford to take your time.  The\
  \ longer trip has its\u2019 own hurdles, and isolation can be one of them.  \n My\
  \ partner and I were lucky to spend four months exploring southern and central Europe\
  \ last spring. We eventually made it to pricier cities like Budapest and Vienna\
  \ but it was in cheaper, out of the way places like Albania that we really settled\
  \ in.  The jagged peaks of the Accursed Mountains, azure blue Ionian coastline,\
  \ centuries of fascinating history on the Ottoman conquest trail, and some of the\
  \ most hospitable people you can imagine; long isolated little Albania is the whole\
  \ package. When I say the locals are kind and welcoming, I refer mostly to people\
  \ in the service industry, the waiters, tour guides, and taxi drivers integral to\
  \ the travel experience, most of whom speak a good deal of English.  Meeting people\
  \ who aren\u2019t obligated to help you is a bit harder.  Moving on to a new country\
  \ every few weeks or days, it can be difficult if not downright impossible to pick\
  \ up a conversational level of each countries\u2019 unique language.  You get by\
  \ on smiles and gestures, a surface level of contact which can feel frustratingly\
  \ shallow. We\u2019d come into Albania in early March, travelling overland through\
  \ Greece and arriving in Berat, an enchanting little city with an imposing medieval\
  \ castle perched on cliffs above the town.  Walking along the riverfront promenade,\
  \ drinking espresso and taking the air like the locals, we came upon a rinky dink\
  \ little amusement park, mostly closed for the season.  Flashing lights led us to\
  \ a familiar sight, bumper cars, though the sign read Bowling Cars. For twenty five\
  \ cents a round, we joined what looked like a teenager\u2019s birthday party, though\
  \ without speaking Albanian, who knows.  We raced around the track, trading bumps\
  \ of perhaps slightly unsafe power with the laughing kids.  The attraction\u2019\
  s middle aged operators played too, pulling fancy trick moves and treating the activity\
  \ like the serious business that it was.  We were welcome there implicitly, everyone\
  \ protesting dramatically when we left. This will always be the first thing I\u2019\
  ll think of when remembering Berat, an experience that didn\u2019t need words to\
  \ be meaningful. Jumping headfirst into situations you don\u2019t fully understand\
  \ can be the best way to see how people really live."
