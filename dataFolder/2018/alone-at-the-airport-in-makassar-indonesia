Text: "Alone at the airport in Makassar, Indonesia, I patiently waited for a message\
  \ from Mazra, a woman that I connected with over Workaway.com. After spending countless\
  \ days in the backpacker bubble of Canggu, Bali, it was time to step outside of\
  \ my comfort zone and seek out a more culturally immersive experience. With admittedly\
  \ very knowledge of the what I had signed up for, I got in Mazra's car and travelled\
  \ 8 hours north to the small, rural village of Belopa, where I would live with Mazra\
  \ and her family for the next three weeks. \n\nI was instantly greeted by a swarm\
  \ of veiled women and children, many of whom pulled me in for a selfie. A woman\
  \ picked up my bright, red headed ponytail and laughed. I was the first foreigner\
  \ she had ever met. Everywhere I went there were swarms of people looking at me\
  \ and taking my photo. I often joked that this is the closest I would ever come\
  \ to being followed by the paparazzi. \n\nI quickly learned the daily routine of\
  \ the D\u2019Battos Islamic Kindergarten, which was attached to Mazra\u2019s home.\
  \ These children followed me around all day long. They knew very little English,\
  \ so I periodically made silly faces at them, which sent them into uncontrollable\
  \ fits of laughter. It was fascinating to observe the role that religion played\
  \ in their daily lives from such an early age. Little girls in hijab\u2019s proudly\
  \ sported t-shirts that read \"I read Quoran,\" and the children stopped playing\
  \ to pray multiple times a day. \n\nDespite the apparent cultural differences between\
  \ Mazra and myself, she was so open to discussing absolutely anything and everything.\
  \ I remember one day she said \u201CLaura, I bet you are curious about my Hijab,\u201D\
  \ and then dove into a two hour conversation about why she chooses to wear a hijab,\
  \ why it is a choice, and the dynamics between men and women in the muslim religion.\
  \ \u201CAs long as you are open with me, I will be open with you,\u201D Mazra repeatedly\
  \ said. We had countless conversations about why Islam is misunderstood in the west,\
  \ and what her religion means to her. Mazra is one of the most kind, fascinating\
  \ people I have ever met. There is not a moment of this woman\u2019s life that is\
  \ not dedicated to helping other people. \n\nAs a city girl from Canada, my time\
  \ in Belopa was worlds away from anything that I had ever experienced. The food,\
  \ language and lifestyle were all so new to me. Despite this, I felt at home in\
  \ Belopa. Hospitality and kindness transcend all differences."
