Text: "How long is too long to wait for the promise of satisfaction? Boulder, Colorado\
  \ has a personality so incomparable to any other town, it could be its own country.\
  \ Where hippies own mansions, and millionaires walk barefoot, it packages the unexpected\
  \ into an illusionary premise of normal. Venturing around on Boulder's main Street,\
  \ my father and I had an hour before an appointment. A happy yellow flower advertising\
  \ \u201CThe Yellow Deli\u201D, banjo music and a delicious smell seduced us to enter.\
  \ The interior was rustic, as an old barn fa\xE7ade had been mounted inside and\
  \ all furniture was fashioned from different types of wood. At first glance, the\
  \ restaurant was full of content people. A lucky find. We were quickly seated at\
  \ a table and given menus to gaze upon. Distracted by the descriptions of edible\
  \ pleasantries, half an hour had passed before realizing that no one had acknowledged\
  \ us. Succumbing to a heightened awareness of uneasiness, my focus widened to observe\
  \ the restaurant. It wasn\u2019t full of people eating, but full of people waiting.\
  \ Time was running out, yet invested and extremely curious as to what reality we\
  \ had been warped into, we were reluctant to leave. Abandoning the idea of getting\
  \ table service, we approached the counter. A homemade \"muffin of the day\u201D\
  \ was ready for the taking. \"Would you like the muffin steamed and with butter?\"\
  . Sure, how long could that take? The lady working the register smiled merrily.\
  \ 20 minutes later...20 minutes later, the voluminous berry muffin royally arrived\
  \ atop a plate and with a fork. Apparently, it was that type of pastry. After swallowing\
  \ the first bite, my father placed down the fork. He paused for a moment, then in\
  \ a serious tone, told me to \"Try this muffin\". I took a bite cautiously, anticipating\
  \ what could be wrong. Instead, all of my taste buds ignited and I melted into my\
  \ senses, just like the hot butter that was moistening the cake. I now comprehended\
  \ his mysterious demeanour. It represented a feeling of utter disbelief. An unexpected\
  \ experience disguised in a familiar shape. The best muffin either one of us had\
  \ ever had and in the most bizarre fashion. Salivating at the assurance of delectability\
  \ from anything else on the menu, we vowed to return on the condition of having\
  \ much more time. I arrived late for the appointment but upon hearing we stopped\
  \ at The Yellow Deli, they understood. A few weeks later I was at a party out of\
  \ town. \"Oh Boulder\" a man said, \"where it takes twenty minutes to get a muffin\"\
  ."
