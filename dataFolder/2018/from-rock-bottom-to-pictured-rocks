Text: "In Summer of 2016, my family hit rock bottom. The canary in the coal mine,\
  \ my baby brother, was found unconscious by my other brother, who immediately called\
  \ paramedics to revive him. They did so successfully -- but no longer were we able\
  \ to hide the truth. We had a major problem. It was essentially that our family\
  \ was not really a family. We had been broken a long time ago, but never healed.\
  \ We just kept straggling along somehow, til we got to this point.\n\nWhen I heard\
  \ the news, I flew back to Michigan to become an active presence in their lives,\
  \ praying for healing of my family. And when I got on a city bus and saw on the\
  \ seat next to me a local magazine with the title \u201CBest Michigan Road Trips\u201D\
  , I knew this was the heaven-sent response. I brought it to my brother\u2019s house\
  \ and left it open to the page about Pictured Rocks, in Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula.\n\
  \nA year later, Summer 2017, the trip materialized -- we made the 5+ hour drive\
  \ up to Grand Marais, on the great Lake Superior. I had never been to Pictured Rocks\
  \ before, and my cup began gushing over when I met with its magnificence. It was\
  \ unlike anything I had ever seen, yet it had been there for millennia. In awe,\
  \ we crept barefoot through a primordial forest of moss, ferns, and pines, rising\
  \ to hundreds of feet above the shore, absorbing the resplendent beauty and wisdom\
  \ of one astounding scene after another.\n\n At one point along the trail, a natural\
  \ rock formation jutted out from the cliffs, giving the illusion of floating above\
  \ the water -- with a bed of sand bidding welcome to its own special secluded beach.\
  \ I stretched out and watched the water below moving in waves, its gentle rhythmic\
  \ motion lulling me into a hypnotic trance.\n\nThen, resuming the trail, climbing\
  \ even higher, winding through the woods along the cliffside, things kept getting\
  \ even more spectacular. The expanse revealed unexpected hues of turquoise and blue\
  \ in the water. The rays of the sun danced on its surface, infusing the world with\
  \ joy. It was a perfect summer day. I realized with delight that what I was seeing\
  \ now was truly \u201Cthe most beautiful place in America\u201D.\n\nIt was nature,\
  \ and it was free. And it was alive -- like us. I realized that it was part of us\
  \ as much as we were part of it. There is so much more to us than the problems weighing\
  \ us down, and we could access this treasure now, rendering the problems of civilization\
  \ non-existent for that moment, transcending them with every step up. Becoming what\
  \ we always truly were."
