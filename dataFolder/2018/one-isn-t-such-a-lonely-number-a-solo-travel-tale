Text: "I had never been on a vacation out of the country. \u201CYou\u2019re going\
  \ to Jamaica?!\u201D  A \u2018yes\u2019 reply opened the floodgates of curiosity\
  \ when I shared my travel plans with those closest to me. \u201CWho are you going\
  \ with?\u201D Most braced themselves and scoffed at my decision to take my first\
  \ international trip alone. Concerns for safety and companionship came up from the\
  \ time I clicked \u201CBook It!\u201D \n\nI wasn\u2019t worried. At best, I\u2019\
  d get to spend some time at peace in solitude on an island paradise and wander in\
  \ the warmth of the Caribbean sun. At worst I\u2019d keep a slight buzz and stay\
  \ on the resort out of fear and apathy. Either way, I was going! I packed up an\
  \ eye-popping collection of bathing suits and intangibles and headed to the home\
  \ of Reggae music, Patois, and coconut trees.  \n\nThe humid island air took my\
  \ breath away as I exited Sangster International Airport in Montego Bay. I marveled\
  \ at the scenic beauty and rich skin tones of the locals along the way to Secrets\
  \ Resort. I was hungry for a hearty Jamaican breakfast of salt fish and akee, and\
  \ ready to experience what Jamaica had to offer. I never expected what would happen\
  \ next.\n\nThat afternoon as I dried off from an afternoon of ocean swimming in\
  \ turquoise waters I sipped on a Pain Killer cocktail at an outdoor bar. A few gentlemen\
  \ sat beside me. Within minutes we were laughing like old friends. The group grew\
  \ exponentially as they were then joined by their wives. \u201CIt\u2019s a tradition,\u201D\
  \ they said with huge smiles. Every year they picked a location and met for an elusive\
  \ adults-only getaway. \n\n\u201CYou\u2019re not here by yourself, are you?\u201D\
  \ asked one of the wives. I hesitated. What if they\u2019re crazy people, I thought.\
  \ Then my carefree spirit kicked in. You only life once, right! I told them I'd\
  \ come alone. \u201CWe\u2019re adopting you,\u201D she smiled. I joined them for\
  \ dinner where they convinced me to book an excursion. The following day we left\
  \ the resort. We zipped-lined. We luxuriated on tubes down clear river waters. We\
  \ rode ATVs through a fruit orchard and picked our own oranges. I had the time of\
  \ my life. It was thrilling!  \n\nThe next bit of news came as a welcome surprise!\
  \ We happened to be visiting during Reggae Sum fest. For two nights in a row, and\
  \ for a damn-good price, we went to a massive reggae party off resort. We toasted\
  \ to the good life with Red Stripe. I never expected to make such open  new friends\
  \ with a zeal for travel and passion for reggae music. This might never have happened\
  \ if I didn't put fear aside and go alone!"
