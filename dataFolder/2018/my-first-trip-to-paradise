Text: "\u2018MY FIRST TRIP TO PARADISE\u2019 \nAs any random girl what their hobbies\
  \ are and I bet you some where on the list will be \u2018Travelling\u2019, as \u2018\
  WHY?\u2019 and the clich\xE9 answer is, \u2018Its fun\u2019.\nFun and enthrallment\
  \ is what you get on your first trip to Rwanda, a tiny nation located in East Africa.\n\
  From the moment my eyes and brain discerned that Kigali, the Rwandan capital is\
  \ what I was looking at from the window of my seat on Rwanda Air, I knew that I\
  \ was headed for amazement. \nThey say Rwanda is \u2018the land of 1000 hills, I\
  \ say Kigali is the city of 100,000 lights and more\u2019.\nThe stretch from the\
  \ Kigali International Airport to the Orient Park Hotel where we had been booked\
  \ is one of the most visually satisfying rides I have had in a while. Its was tending\
  \ to 11 pm in Rwanda, the city is deserted and only a few vehicles ply the clean\
  \ bright streets in the city. As we enter the gate of our hotel, am baffled by the\
  \ hospitality we receive from the gate to our beds.\nIf the politeness of these\
  \ girls at the front desk is feigned, then they are really good at it.\nAfter a\
  \ long day, my colleagues and I retired to bed ready for next day\u2019s Rwanda\
  \ Patriotic Front, [email\_protected] celebrations.\nDuring my 10 days stay there,\
  \ I veered from the script of my hosts to discover more about this beauty of a nation.\
  \ Here is what I gathered\nI later learn that in Rwandan traffic laws, no \u2018\
  motor\u2019, is allowed to carry a passenger without a helmet, and each should carry\
  \ one at a time. No son of man in their right mind here can even think of defying\
  \ this.\nMy impromptu visit to the peace stadium was to book an interview with the\
  \ minister of Sports and Culture and also get permission to shoot some of the activities\
  \ at the stadium.\nThis until now is the most bureaucratic process I have been through\
  \ my entire journalism life.\nThe lady at the front desk sent me to the Sports director\
  \ of the stadium who sent me to the minister\u2019s adviser\u2019s office, who directed\
  \ me to the secretary of the stadium. The secretary then asked me for a letter of\
  \ introduction from the Office of the General Secretary(OGS).\nJeez, giving up was\
  \ the only appealing option for me and so I did.\nThe people here do not just speak\
  \ to journalists haphazardly. There is a structured procedure one should follow\
  \ to get an interview from a government official and there are no two ways around\
  \ it.\nTHE DISQUETS\n Despite the rapid economic and infrastructural development,\
  \ many individuals are still poor yet the capital, Kigali, is quite expensive to\
  \ live in."
