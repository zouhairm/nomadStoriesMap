Text: "The only thing more grueling than hiking 12 miles up a single-track trail,\
  \ loaded with a 90-pound pack full of rebar and cement, is doing it all over again\
  \ when you get to the top and realize you've forgotten half your supplies at the\
  \ trailhead. The 4000' elevation gain didn't make it any easier but I was glad to\
  \ do it, even eager, since I was committed to helping prevent the illegal logging\
  \ that was scheduled to take place in the largest roadless area of the Lower 48,\
  \ called Cove/Mallard, in central Idaho. \nAs I raced back down the trail, whipping\
  \ through huge stands of lodgepole pine on my way to the cool waters of the Clearwater\
  \ River, I felt completely free. No job, no rent, no bills. There's something very\
  \ primal in being untethered. \nReaching the river, I stripped down and plunged\
  \ in. It was in the high 90s outside, and I knew the ice cold water might cause\
  \ my muscles to seize up, but I was too hot to care. It was delicious. I found a\
  \ small eddy and floated on my back, gazing up through the canopy and enjoying the\
  \ wind on my face, putting off the return hike until I'd soaked in as much of the\
  \ cold as I could. As it turned out, this would be the last time I'd be near water\
  \ for 77 days. That's how long the blockade lasted, long enough to prevent the logging\
  \ equipment from getting in and long enough for the appellate court to uphold the\
  \ lower court's decision to keep the area wild. \nSitting around a backyard campfire\
  \ in Boise one warm summer night, talking about what could possibly be done to save\
  \ the largest roadless area for miles around, none of us ever thought we'd be living\
  \ in trees for eleven weeks. We never thought we'd be shot at, or have all our belongings\
  \ burned, or be banned from patronizing every store, bar and restaurant in the quaint\
  \ towns of Dixie, Grangeville, or Elk City. None of us knew our only source of water\
  \ would come from a seep, a trickle of water oozing so slowly out of a rock that\
  \ it took all day to fill a five-gallon bucket. Showers were not an option and the\
  \ morning coffee took an hour to make and was nearly as gritty as the local characters\
  \ who haunted our perimeter every weekend. Tobacco was hoarded in much the same\
  \ way it is in prison and alcohol was nonexistent. Food was brought in once a week\
  \ by friends of friends. Oh, but the views! Perched atop a swaying 6' x 3' platform,\
  \ looking at a forest that stretched out uninterrupted to the horizon in every direction,\
  \ more than made up for the lost niceties of civilization."
