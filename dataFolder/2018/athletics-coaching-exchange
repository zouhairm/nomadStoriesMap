Text: "On arrival at Nairobi airport, I was greeted by Gerald, my driver. Gerald proceeded\
  \ to give me a guided tour of the city on my way to the Hotel La Mada. My first\
  \ impression of Nairobi was the large volume of traffic, the result of a massive\
  \ road building programme, currently under construction, with the support of the\
  \ Chinese government. We drove through the bustling city centre taking in the Parliament\
  \ buildings, the burial ground of Kenya\u2019s first president, Jomo Kenyatta and\
  \ the impressive conference centre building. Once we had managed to navigate the\
  \ tricky diverted road system, I arrived at the hotel which was situated in a beautiful\
  \ forest setting. By this stage, it was time for lunch in the outdoor dining area.\
  \ No sooner than I was tucking into my food I was joined by a visitor \u2013 a monkey!\
  \ The friendly waitress told me that they lived wild in the forest and were always\
  \ on the look out for an opportunity with an unsuspecting guest! After an early\
  \ night\u2019s sleep it was time to meet the Kenyan sprints and hurdles coaches\
  \ who I would be working with for the duration of my stay. On arrival at the IAAF\
  \ African Regional Development Centre and Athletics Kenya offices, I was greeted\
  \ by Martin Oitangor, hurdles coach. We instantly built a rapport with one another\
  \ as Martin seemed just as excited as me to be working with a coach from another\
  \ country. Martin had previously worked for 30 years on the East African railways\
  \ before taking up hurdles coaching to see him through his retirement years. We\
  \ headed off to the training track to watch the World Championship Kenyan athletics\
  \ squad preparing for the upcoming World Championships in Daegu, South Korea. On\
  \ first impressions it was unbelievable to see so many world class endurance athletes\
  \ all training at the same venue. It was amazing to see David Rudisha, the world\
  \ 800 metre record holder in full flight during one of his training runs. Martin\
  \ soon introduced me to an interesting Irishman by the name of Brother Colm O\u2019\
  Connell. Colm had come over to Kenya from Cork in the 60\u2019s as a catholic school\
  \ teacher at St Patrick\u2019s Boys school in Iten. Listening to his story filled\
  \ me with awe as he told me how he had identified talent in the Rift Valley area\
  \ through the schools systems. This talent was nurtured and as a result has produced\
  \ two world 800 metre record holders \u2013 Wilson Kipketer and David Rudisha as\
  \ well as four Olympic gold medal winners!"
