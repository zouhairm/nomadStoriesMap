Text: "It was my second time in Costa Rica. My friend Amin arrived at the airport\
  \ an hour after me and a friend took us to the bus station. She made sure we got\
  \ on the correct bus. Everything was going according to plan. We were to get off\
  \ in La Virgen across the street from the Red Cross. The bus ride was two hours.\
  \ \n\nAmin and I put our luggage in the side compartment of the bus, found a couple\
  \ seats and settled in for the drive. The sky grew dark as night fell. It took a\
  \ while to leave San Jose due to traffic. As we left the city, the bus stopped to\
  \ drop off or pick up passengers in some strange places. Sometimes there was a discernable\
  \ bus stop. At other times there was no bus stop. Two hours passed, then three hours.\
  \ Amin found he could use the GPS on his phone to see where we were. Otherwise our\
  \ phones didn\u2019t work and of course there was no wifi on the bus.\n\nI asked\
  \ the old man sitting next to me where we were. He did not understand my broken\
  \ Spanish, nor did I understand him. At one of the stops I saw a building that might\
  \ be the Red Cross. I got out of the bus and asked the people outside if we had\
  \ reached La Virgen. \u201CNo, falta mas!\u201D \u201CNo, not yet!\u201D I got back\
  \ on the bus and told Amin. At three and a half hours into our bus ride, Amin exclaimed,\
  \ \u201CKari! We\u2019re in La Virgen!\u201D We got our backpacks and ran out of\
  \ the bus. I asked a man outside if this was La Virgen, Sarapiqui Outdoor Center.\
  \ As he responded, the bus moved forward. Amin and I had not yet gotten our luggage\
  \ out of the side compartment. I ran and yelled to the bus driver, \u201CEspera!\
  \ Espera!\u201D \u201CWait! Wait!\u201D The bus driver yelled something unintelligible\
  \ and drove off, both bus door and luggage compartment still open. \n\nThankfully\
  \ the man knew the area. We had gotten off the bus one stop early. We walked to\
  \ the Outdoor Center and jumped in a van with the manager David in quick pursuit\
  \ of the bus. The last stop in Puerto Viejo was 20 minutes away. We raced through\
  \ La Virgen, a sleepy river town, jumping over speed bumps and careening around\
  \ cars ahead of us on the road. We caught up to the bus as it was pulling in through\
  \ the gate at the station to park for the night. David and the bus driver exchanged\
  \ words while Amin and I grabbed our luggage. As we drove back to La Virgen, David\
  \ welcomed us to Costa Rica. He told us that Costa Rican buses count each passenger\
  \ entering the bus and that drivers are responsible for that fare. This was a new\
  \ system to me. And all of this on my birthday!"
