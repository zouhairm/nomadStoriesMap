Text: "I never thought I would find myself in a desert, let alone the driest one in\
  \ the world. Sand and I had always had problems so I surprised even myself in deciding\
  \ to travel to a place of endless sand. During the many beach trips of my childhood,\
  \ I would take painstaking steps to keep sand off of me and I hated sand so much\
  \ that I started to avoid the beach just so I could avoid the hassle of dealing\
  \ with it. My hatred of sand, however, did not outweigh my appetite for new experiences\
  \ so when someone proposed the idea of traveling to Atacama, I jumped at the opportunity.\
  \ I have seen mountains, oceans, lakes, rivers, cities, rain forests, beaches, plain\
  \ lands, but never had I been to a desert. \nMy heart was pounding when we were\
  \ dropped off by the airport shuttle in the small town of San Pedro. I could feel\
  \ the sun burning my skin already and the dusty air dried out my lips quickly. The\
  \ vibrant colors and smells of the various artisan markets kept me occupied until\
  \ it was time to embark on our tour to the Valley of the Moon, named so because\
  \ it supposedly seemed like a different planet. Just because it was a different\
  \ planet, however, did not mean that there was no sand, so I was cautious. I wore\
  \ long pants to keep sand from getting into my boots and was careful when hiking.\
  \ We arrived at the top of the valley, to the Dune Mayor, and I suddenly forgot\
  \ my hatred of sand, even though I was looking at literal tons of it. The wind wrinkled\
  \ the dune and the sun illuminated the sand so we could see its dark, volcanic color.\
  \ I no longer understood how I could hate something that created such an astoundingly\
  \ beautiful landscape. The wind was whipping at my face and sending sand into my\
  \ mouth as I took a photo of the dune while crouched low to the ground and it did\
  \ not bother me at all. Standing atop that dune, watching the sand stretch endlessly\
  \ to the horizon, I forgot my past with sand thought only on the future. In that\
  \ moment, I knew that I wanted to travel to more deserts. I knew that I wanted to\
  \ be surrounded by the beautiful desert landscape and enjoy the grandness of it.\
  \ The tours I had for the rest of my weekend in Atacama only solidified my newfound\
  \ affinity for sand. I walked through it as I exited a salt lagoon without a second\
  \ thought. I let it fill my boots as I hiked up dunes just to sandboard down. I\
  \ gladly shook it out of my clothes after laying in the desert at 2 AM while stargazing.\
  \ I fell in love with the desert, and the sand that filled it up."
