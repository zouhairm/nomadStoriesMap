Text: "Natasha accidentally slammed my thumb in the car door hours before we flew\
  \ to Russia. In the air she taught me my first Russian word: lyod, which means ice,\
  \ in order to beg for it from the unwilling Aeroflot flight attendants. Maybe they\
  \ had a limited supply, because each time I plunged my hand into a new cup to reduce\
  \ the blackness creeping up my nail, there seemed to be more lukewarm water and\
  \ less lyod. \n\nIt was Natasha's cheerful aunt Olga, a doctor with infectious laughter,\
  \ who got us after we landed. Moscow's stern faces, grey buildings, cute squirrels\
  \ and completely nonsensical driving dazzled me immediately. Olga took us to a cleared\
  \ area in the woods where she and her friends prepared shashliki, which is a Russian\
  \ style cook-out. Skewered lamb, dried salted fish, and giant bottles of beer were\
  \ passed around as I listened through the fog of a foreign language to the joys\
  \ and gripes of these Muscovites.\n\nSoon, Olga noticed my thumbnail (now black\
  \ and throbbing). Alarmed , she drove us to her apartment and woke the hospital\
  \ director who lived on the floor under her. He took a look at my nail in his PJs,\
  \ changed, and drove Natasha and I to the hospital.\n\nAn x-ray showed that my finger\
  \ was not broken, so with plastic slippers over our shoes, Natasha interpreted to\
  \ me (in graphic detail), that my best option was to remove the nail completely.\
  \ The doctor took me into a stark surgical room. A nurse with a lot of cleavage\
  \ tourniqueted my thumb and injected an anesthetic. The doctor asked me, \u201C\
  ok?\u201D I said no, so she emptied another syringe into my hand. I looked away\
  \ and felt only pressure as he removed the nail. Then, horrifyingly, a rush of hot\
  \ liquid ran over my hand and he uttered his first sentence in English -and the\
  \ last thing I wanted to hear in this situation.\n\n\u201CEh... not good.\u201D\
  \ \n\nI'll spare the details, but eventually they patched me up. Olga fed us and\
  \ shipped us back to the hospital to be looked at in the morning. The nurse gently\
  \ redressed my thumb and explained to Natasha how to take care of it. \n\nOver the\
  \ rest of the trip, different strangers took turns redressing the wound, generally\
  \ with a few shots of vodka (for all of us) beforehand. I was stunned by their brute\
  \ kindness and loud devotions to communal values. That painful accident led me to\
  \ see a side of Russian generosity and concern that I never would have ever experienced\
  \ otherwise. Without a single ruble spent, I would call that a priceless experience,\
  \ though it did cost a fingernail!"
