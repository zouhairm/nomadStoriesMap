Text: "I met Paulo on the roof of his house in Almagro the night of his 23rd birthday.\
  \ The air reeked of Amsterdam Shag and vodka; my friend Sara was dancing and mingling\
  \ a few feet away. He was the only white person that looked distinctly American,\
  \ as opposed to the more European features one would see on most porte\xF1os; he\
  \ spoke perfect Spanish with a noted Columbian accent. As I suspected, he was born\
  \ in New Jersey. He was drinking Coca-Cola and Fernet in a blend that I compared\
  \ to cough medicine. He laughed; this is what they drink at Argentine parties.\n\
  \nI passed out drunk on his roommate's bed. The next morning, I woke up hungover\
  \ to him heating up water and putting green herbs into a gourd. He offered me my\
  \ first mate.\n\nAs I became closer to his roommate Nicolas, Sara and I would spend\
  \ days at their house, doing work and day drinking. The days became nights as we\
  \ explored the city together, from Palermo's rooftop bars to seeing local psych\
  \ rockers Los Esp\xEDritus play the Estadio Malvinas Argentinas on the outskirts\
  \ of town. One particularly late night blasting Manu Chao's \"Welcome to Tijuana,\"\
  \ we decided our group needed a name.\n\nWe called ourselves Tijuana.\n\nWe skulked\
  \ San Telmo at night, laughing drunk under the colonial streetlamps. We turned off\
  \ the lights in Paulo's house and blasted Led Zeppelin, singing along until our\
  \ throats were hoarse. We played cards and talked apprehensively of the future.\
  \ We cried. We howled. We hugged each other. We woke up on his floor, covered in\
  \ ash and smelling like a night well spent. We would wake up in different beds and\
  \ circumstances, but never straying from each other. If Buenos Aires is the city\
  \ where I have seen the most sunrises, those four are the reason why. \n\nWe shared\
  \ everything: cigarettes, mate, music magazines. One pack of Luckies was always\
  \ split with the group; two Americans not used to how relatively accessible Argentine\
  \ tobacco was, we became chimneys. The day before I left, we shared a bottle of\
  \ rum and a pack of Lucky Strikes on the roof of Sara's cousin's apartment. It was\
  \ the dead of summer. We hugged and looked out into the distance. The day before\
  \ I left I learned Buenos Aires had no skyline.\n\nI don't smoke anymore, but I\
  \ still wake up sometimes on my cushioned mattress in Brooklyn and think fondly\
  \ on December's summer nights. Nights of Coca-Cola and Fernet, of mate and tobacco,\
  \ of Argentine rock and deep conversation."
