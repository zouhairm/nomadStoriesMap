Text: "What I have learnt through all my travel experiences, never ever think yourself\
  \ a tourist while you get to the place you dreamt to make love with. Yes, quite\
  \ obvious, one could be excited, curios, but when you start thinking yourself to\
  \ be a localised person there, you end up gaining more love from the place anyhow.\
  \ Live every moment on that place like you have been called to migrate the place\
  \ and essentially you need to know all the things back there in order to survive.\n\
  One such story of the place I had been to to back then. Divyeagar, call me a beach\
  \ lover or ocean lover, but I do have a special bonding with the beaches, when I\
  \ visit them. So, a plan was made in couple of hours, as my friends were all ready\
  \ with travelling plans and certainly some exotic drinks, which is certainly another\
  \ part to be enjoyed at a bonfire on beaches at night. So expectedly we reached\
  \ to our resort at midnight 3 am,  the atmosphere is lovely back there,  the wind\
  \ that plays whistling song while the sound of crashing of the waves sends a fear\
  \ to that ecstatic heart inside. I always had a dream to witness the beach at night,\
  \ Yes through all the made by me to my friends, we made a plan work, we decided\
  \ to go to the kashid beach at night, I went merry. Every moment I went closer the\
  \ distance I felt my heart going to and fro, my fears swung like a pendulum, sometimes\
  \ I felt to get back to the resort with increasing intensity of volume of crashing\
  \ waves, while sometimes I felt, If, not now the love with beach at night session\
  \ is to be made then it\u2019s never happening again. Collecting all the guts, I\
  \ put a bravefront to feel the scenario there, did I mention I had phobia of Sea\
  \ appearing monstrous at night? The day of my trip altered my phobia too, I actually\
  \ loved the atmosphere than feared. I realised how small my problems and my life\
  \ are in comparison with this enormously big waves. Back in city life, we tend to\
  \ complain with almost every thing we are associated with, but what altered it was\
  \ the travel experience of forgetting about every thing in life and start loving\
  \ it. I still think, would it have been ever possible to overcome this one of small\
  \ fear in monstrous big life like a big wave? Had it not been a trip to the beach,\
  \ I wouldn\u2019t have discovered a trick to make things fall in place to overcome\
  \ any fear in life."
