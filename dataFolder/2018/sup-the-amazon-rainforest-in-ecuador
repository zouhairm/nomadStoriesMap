Text: "FOLLOWING A SUNRISE SUP (STAND UP PADDLEBOARD) YOGA SESSION IN THE MIDDLE OF\
  \ ONE OF THE FLOODED LAGOONS OF THE AMAZON RAINFOREST, I SAT STILL ON MY BOARD,\
  \ AND OBSERVED AS A FAMILY OF PINK DOLPHINS SWAM AROUND US. THE SUN COMING UP, HOWLER\
  \ MONKEYS IN THE BACKGROUND, BIRDS OF ALL COLOURS AND SIZES FLYING ABOVE OUR HEADS,\
  \ IN A VIEW THAT I HAD ONLY EVER IMAGINED AND SEEN ON NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC. One of\
  \ the most bio-diverse ecosystems in the world with the highest concentration of\
  \ plant and animal life per square meter than any other place in the world, SUP\u2019\
  ing the Cuyabeno Reserve is a bucket list opportunity for any person who decides\
  \ to expedition down to the Amazon Rainforest of Ecuador. It is the most unique\
  \ and incredible way to see the jungle. No fences or barriers preventing you from\
  \ connecting to wildlife in its real habitat or motors to scare it away or contaminate\
  \ its waters. The Cuyabeno is a protected natural reserve accessible only via water.\
  \ As far as transportation is concerned, both driving (approximately 9 hours) and\
  \ flying (approximately 40 minutes) from Quito are an option, yet once you get to\
  \ the main port in Lago Agrio, a 2-hour traditional motor boat journey or a 2-day\
  \ journey on paddleboards are the only options. Although flying seems like the ideal\
  \ alternative, the road trip is worth every minute as the landscape changes drastically\
  \ around three times throughout the trip. Beginning with the highest mountain pass\
  \ in the country, home of the Andean Bear, winding roads will eventually turn into\
  \ lush cloud forests and waterfalls leaving snow covered peaks behind. Rivers of\
  \ all shapes and sizes and landscapes of every colour of green line the way into\
  \ the port of what will become the most epic adventure. A typical eco adventure\
  \ tour lasts for 3 nights 4 days, but can be extended upon request.  Most of the\
  \ time will be spent out on the water swimming and exploring the flooded forest\
  \ lagoons on SUPs spotting wildlife\u2014including but not limited to caimans, pink\
  \ dolphins, anacondas, manatees and monkeys.Even though the trip\u2019s effort level\
  \ is easy to moderate and is suitable for all ages and levels of expertise, Day\
  \ 3 will challenge everyone with an exciting 5 hours of paddling across jungle channels\
  \ to visit a Siona Indigenous Community who will share a bit of their culture and\
  \ teach us how to make a traditional dish called cassave. A final note on weather:\
  \ temperatures in the jungle vary from hot to really hot and be prepared for it\
  \ to rain."
