Text: "Traveling around the city of Havana in a fading pastel jalopy, our driver dropped\
  \ us off at a well-known bar, as we ordered the much-anticipated Hemingway Mojito,\
  \ and plotted out our exploration.  Outside of the establishment, a man approached\
  \ us.  The man didn\u2019t seem like your typical Cuban.  Although the Cuban people\
  \ were diverse, there were features and characteristics which compelled you to believe\
  \ that they were in fact naturally Cuban; this man seemed different.  He was smaller\
  \ in stature, his features were uncharacteristically petite and his complexion was\
  \ unique to what we had seen.  \u201CCan I help you guys find anything?\u201D he\
  \ asked.  Unfamiliar with the area, and intrigued by the offer, we obliged.\n\n\
  Our new friend, \u201CEd,\u201D as he called himself, gave us a walking tour around\
  \ the city, we came upon the last thing I\u2019d expect to see in the Central American\
  \ city.  As we gazed up at the giant arch, acting as a gateway to another part of\
  \ the city we inquired, \u201CWhat\u2019s that?\u201D\n\nEd replied by giving us\
  \ a short history lesson.  He explained that the Chinese and Cubans had a long history\
  \ and in the 1950\u2019s, many Chinese people had moved to Havana as the countries\
  \ had many business ties, giving root to what we were observing in awe; Chinatown.\n\
  \nWe perused the town within a city, mesmerized by the history.  The structures\
  \ were an amalgamation of Asian and Cuban influences.  Chinese symbols engraved\
  \ on buildings were juxtaposed with 1960\u2019s clunkers resembling the Havana stereotype.\
  \  Nothing seemed to fit together, yet it all seemed to make sense.\n\nThe area\
  \ was not abandoned, but still felt like a ghost town.  The buildings were not kept\
  \ well, and the traces of Chinese influences diminished greatly.  The people; sparse\
  \ and Cuban.  \n\nWith the begging question on my mind, Ed began to provide answers\
  \ before I could even ask.  He went on to say that relations between the Chinese\
  \ and Cuban governments became increasingly strained, and those who had taken root\
  \ in the tropical city abandoned their newfound home.  Some stayed behind with their\
  \ children, but have since passed.  \n\nEd pointed out that, if you look around,\
  \ you\u2019ll see those who were products of the short-lived hybrid society.  He\
  \ said that you\u2019ll see Cuban\u2019s that look slightly different.  He went\
  \ on to explain that you could usually tell by their eyes, nose and skin tone, pointing\
  \ out his own features.  \n\nEd himself, had been a product of the interestingly\
  \ historic and failed communist partnership of a former generation."
