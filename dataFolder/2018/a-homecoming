Text: "\u201CGently\u201D, Eddyr cautions, although I instinctively know what to do.\
  \ Gingerly, I stroke her back, and a trail of slime comes away under my fingers.\
  \ Beneath the star-studded night sky, it glows blue. Bioluminescence. \n\nCabo Verde\
  \ is a welcome oasis of peace in a world so dominated by conflict and political\
  \ upheavals. Despite its populace tracing their roots to the 16th C transatlantic\
  \ slave trade, the people accept their origins with morabeza. Good vibes. Sal Island,\
  \ where I am, throngs with tourists hoping to try their hand at kite-surfing, the\
  \ archipelagic island-nation\u2019s famous sport.\n\nHowever, between June and October\
  \ each year, the island truly comes alive at night-time.\n\nAll along the beach\
  \ where Eddyr and I are crouched, dark silhouettes emerge from the water. Cabo Verde\
  \ boasts the third largest population of loggerhead sea turtles in the world. Most\
  \ of them seem to be here tonight; it is a good night, Eddyr concedes.\n\nWe watch\
  \ as the female close to us painstakingly scoops out sand with her rear flippers,\
  \ deep in a \u2018laying trance\u2019. Scoop. Throw. Pat. Repeat. In the far distance,\
  \ the lights of Santa Maria burn yellow. The waves murmur against the beach; if\
  \ I strain my ears, I can catch the faint sounds of Cabo Verdean songs playing in\
  \ the town bars. \n\nOf all the eggs being laid here tonight, only one out of a\
  \ thousand hatchlings will make it to adulthood, and return to its natal beach,\
  \ perhaps in twenty years\u2019 time. Eddyr, among other conservationists, is working\
  \ hard to ensure the survival of this species. Turtles make soft targets for poachers,\
  \ who abound on this island. Last year just 30 turtles got taken, a record, he smiles.\n\
  \nTo look into the bottomless eye of this ancient is to lose oneself in the millennia\
  \ past. To be flooded with the narrative of her solitary foray into the wide and\
  \ unforgiving ocean, her \u2018lost years at sea\u2019, her survival against all\
  \ odds, and her eventual return to where she hatched. \n\nAs she finishes covering\
  \ her eggs, I reach out and touch her again, gently, in utter awe. Morabeza. In\
  \ the faint light of dawn (she has been at it for hours!), her true splendour is\
  \ revealed \u2013 orange, brown and ochre. A wizened face of indeterminate years.\
  \ She looks at her nest one last time, and begins her way back to the sea.\n\nSeeing\
  \ her go, I wonder if she will return the next year, and how many thousands of miles\
  \ she would have travelled in the borderless ocean before she does so. A naturalised\
  \ Cabo Verdean, yet truly a global denizen."
