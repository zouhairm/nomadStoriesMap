Text: "Think what you like about Brussels, the seat of diplomacy of the European Union,\
  \ and, despite the UK \u2013 my beautiful, cranky, country of citizenship \u2013\
  \ kicking and screaming its way out, the EU still reigns supreme there in all its\
  \ bland glory. It is hard to imagine Brussels as anything other than boring old\
  \ buildings and grey suits, MEPs grinding their way to world peace, one statute\
  \ at a time. I was there for the most mundane of reasons \u2013 to get a stamp on\
  \ my Schengen visa, so I could visit its cooler sibling in the EU, Italy. My day\
  \ started early, with a nosebleed of a flight from Stansted to Charleroi, with grumpy,\
  \ sharp-elbowed passengers on RyanAir. Navigating my way out of the wilderness of\
  \ Charleroi, I found my way to the centre of Brussels, and that\u2019s when my adventure\
  \ started. \n\nI was looking for the Tintin \xA9 Herge Art Gallery, to feed my childhood\
  \ obsession with the boy journalist. A few broken French conversations with aforementioned\
  \ grey suits \u2013 some of who hadn't of Tintin, the TRAGEDY! \u2013 I found my\
  \ way. I spent blissful hours in the company of my first crush, then decided to\
  \ explore more of the city. I ended up in De Grote Markt, like you would. Nothing\
  \ special about this square, you say? \n\nIt was a lovely afternoon, the sunshine,\
  \ warm, the skies, blue, and the square was stunning. I reached De Grote Markt,\
  \ just as a huge crowd of long-haired, dark(ish) outfitted, long-bearded (well,\
  \ the men!) people were assembling. With incredible luck, I\u2019d ended up right\
  \ in time for the European Heavy Metal Band championships. I found a nice spot right\
  \ up front of the stage, and rocked my way through the rest of the afternoon and\
  \ most of the night. The fans around me looked at me with amusement. Had they ever\
  \ seen a tiny, brown, (East) Indian woman with long dark hair, and a backpack larger\
  \ than her whole body, blissfully drinking her beers and headbanging her way through\
  \ some of the Europe\u2019s heaviest metal? At one point, a giant Viking hoisted\
  \ me, backpack and all, on his shoulders, as I screamed with the band on stage (well,\
  \ they were singing in what I assumed was Finnish, so my heavily Indian-accented\
  \ screams weren\u2019t really out of place, per se.) At the end of the night, I\
  \ found a late snack of frites, with plenty of mayonnaise, and also managed to choke\
  \ down some escargots. The friendly food trucker encouraged me, adding more escargots\
  \ and frites to my order. \n\nI didn\u2019t want to leave! Who said Brussels is\
  \ boring? They\u2019ve never seen it like I did."
