Text: "Tired, sweaty, and irritable, Georgia and I reached the head of the trail and\
  \ exchanged mutual looks of dread. We had heard that Playa San Josecito was gorgeous,\
  \ but the hike there was supposedly grueling and we were already exhausted.\n \n\
  Georgia and I had been staying in Drake Bay, a tiny village located on the remote\
  \ Osa Peninsula of Costa Rica, for the past few days. It was a beautiful area, but\
  \ the stifling heat and endless cacophony of bugs and frogs had made for several\
  \ sleepless nights.\n \nPausing for a drink, we started in surprise when two large\
  \ dogs burst out of the undergrowth, greeting us with big grins and wagging tails.\
  \ One was black and the other white, but otherwise they were identical, with long\
  \ legs, pointed ears, and clever eyes. To our delight, they began following us along\
  \ the trail.\n \nThe track led us along the coastline, weaving between dense canopies\
  \ of rainforest and small, secluded beaches. The two dogs trotted happily alongside\
  \ side us as we walked, and after an hour we decided that our canine companions\
  \ had earned names. They watched us with bright black eyes and lolling tongues as\
  \ we brainstormed, and we took their wagging tails as agreement when we suggested\
  \ Salt and Pepper.\n \nAfter a few hours we crested a small hill to find Playa San\
  \ Josecito stretched out before us: a long, gleaming sickle of golden sand, fringed\
  \ by palm trees on one side and the glittering expanse of the Pacific Ocean on the\
  \ other. Several scarlet macaws burst from the tree line as we approached, their\
  \ red, blue, and yellow plumage resplendent against the sky.\n \nThere wasn\u2019\
  t a soul in sight.\n \nWhooping in delight, Georgia and I shed our dusty packs and\
  \ raced Salt and Pepper into the ocean. We spent the next few hours splashing in\
  \ the shallows, playing fetch with the dogs, and dozing in the deliciously cool\
  \ shade of the palm trees. Salt and Pepper guarded us vigilantly from skulking monkeys\
  \ as we slept, and we shared our lunches with them in thanks.\n \nAll too soon we\
  \ were packing our belongings to start the hike home. Salt and Pepper guided us\
  \ along the track as the sun sank low on the horizon, gilding the water and glinting\
  \ brightly between the trees. We reached the trailhead shortly before nightfall,\
  \ where the dogs gave our hands one final lick, and disappeared back into the undergrowth.\n\
  \ \nTired, sweaty, and happy, Georgia and I exchanged matching grins as we headed\
  \ home. It\u2019s amazing what meeting a couple of friendly locals can do to raise\
  \ your spirits."
