Text: "Summer comes late to the Arctic Circle. The Arctic Circle! The very name had\
  \ seduced me: I would cycle across Norway deep into this fabled land of the midnight\
  \ sun.\n\nThe weather, however, was a brutal shock. Even in June snow still ribboned\
  \ the mountains. The days were cold and the wind sharp.  \n\nWhen the storm loomed,\
  \ the next town was still two hours away. Should I stop early and pitch my tent,\
  \ or continue? A simple decision: I had only boring food and nothing to read. Besides,\
  \ it was summer, right? \n\nAt first it was easy to be staunch - it was exhilarating\
  \ swooping past the brightly painted holiday homes and around the curves of the\
  \ inlets. But as the rain fell relentlessly and the battering gusts of wind made\
  \ me wobble dangerously, I regretted my choice.    \n\nTwelve kilometers to go.\
  \  Ten.  A long hill and an agonizingly slow descent \u2013 the road slippery and\
  \ my hands frighteningly cold. Then -  look! The huddle of Saltstraumen across the\
  \ strait. \n\nBut in between lay the sinister Maelstrom, the deadliest whirlpool\
  \ in the world.  Even through the rain I heard the water churning ominously, heaving\
  \ and subsiding, as if it were some baleful monster. \n\nMore terrifying yet was\
  \ the soaring bridge I would have to cross \u2013 nearly a kilometer long and forty\
  \ meters high. I am afraid of heights, and I could stand upright only in the lee\
  \ of the electronic sign recording the wind speed: 16.9\u2026 17.8\u2026 17.4. Seventeen\
  \ meters per second! I would be whipped from my bike and flung into the Maelstrom!\
  \ \n\nSurely there had to be a bus, even a taxi \u2013 anything!  \n\nA cheerful\
  \ \u201CHei! Hei!\u201D jolted me: an older man and his dog had stopped companionably\
  \ to chat.  \u201CHerlig! Herlig! Wonderful!\u201D \n\n\u201CJa,\u201D I replied\
  \ politely, thinking his sweeping gesture meant the graceful bridge. But no, it\
  \ was the wildness of wind and water that delighted him.  \n\n\u201CEvery day my\
  \ dog and I, we walk across the bridge. Ja, sometimes it is nicer to be inside,\
  \ but we need friluftsliv.  Friluftsliv? \u2018Free air life\u2019: be part of nature.\
  \ Don\u2019t fight it - enjoy it!\u201D \n\nWas this how Norwegians coped not just\
  \ with summer storms but with the darkness of the polar winter \u2013 not waiting\
  \ for it to pass but celebrating it? Exalting in it? \n\nSeeing me still hesitate,\
  \ the Norwegian encouraged, \u201CTi minutter \u2013 varm dusj!\u201D\n\nIt would\
  \ be much more than ten minutes: I would have to crouch and inch my way across,\
  \ pushing my bike. But a cabin\u2019s warmth and a hot shower!  What was one kilometer?\
  \ \n\nFriluftsliv! I repeated, and stepped out."
