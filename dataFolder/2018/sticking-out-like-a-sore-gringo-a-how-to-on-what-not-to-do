Text: "My girlfriend left early that morning, of extended my trip in the beautiful\
  \ South America and had fallen in love with the Portuguese main. My girl friend\
  \ had come from Australia to visit me, however 5 months was a long time to be seperate\
  \ things, although nice, were on the rocks a feeling shared mutually.\n\nArriving\
  \ back at our hotel room after seeing her off at the airport I packed my things\
  \ and did the usual (by now almost monotonous) ritual of packing my things as neatly\
  \ as I could be bothered, in anticipation to experience my next big adventure. The\
  \ highlights of Brazil and Chile still fresh in my mind and armed with an inate\
  \ knowledge that it was in many ways just the beginning of my trip, I affluently\
  \ and with the youthful grace of a young adult on their way to the first day of\
  \ highschool wandered out of my hotel and set off in the direction of my next hostel\
  \ (150 metres down the road).\n\nMe being impatient at the best of times, decided\
  \ to take a short cut down an alley way in Rio de Janeiro, a city known for tourist\
  \ theft and a place where my long blonde hair and blue eyes made me stick out like\
  \ a sore gringo, and rightly so. i like to think the path I took was pre determined,\
  \ perhaps to teach me a life lesson, a cruel lesson from whoever to tell me that\
  \ commitment to the right path is the only way to success in all facets of life.\n\
  \nAs I walk down this alleyway on a dreary mid afternoon, I can see the door to\
  \ my hostel, rio being a large city, the putrid discusting smell I encountered was\
  \ not unusual but highly unanticipated, after a few more blank minded steps I begin\
  \ to realise that the smell is following me, that I am the stench! As I pay myself\
  \ down, an old lady no younger than 65 almost meajestically extends her brown work\
  \ ridden hands, cupping a handful of much needed wet wipes, I jump at the opportunity\
  \ to condone her and ask for her help! As she wipes me down we chat, or try to in\
  \ broken segments of each other language, I cracked a joke and she lifted her small\
  \ black like in something that resembled a smile, underneath those grissly facial\
  \ highlights her teeth are gold plated, noticing this and bookmarking the sight\
  \ as out of the ordinary, I quickly turn at which point I realise my bag is gone...\
  \ I run up the street to find the man who stole my bag with my passport and an entire\
  \ trip worth of photos, at which point, I realise that my blaz\xE9 attitude, and\
  \ leszais en fair outlook on the every day happenings in South America, eventually\
  \ cost me."
