Text: "Last night I slept in my bed with scented sheets, I had a bathroom all for\
  \ myself, a shower with hot water. I had everything, and I could have rejoiced to\
  \ have returned to comfort, but I slept little and badly because I missed the main\
  \ thing: sharing with my \u2018companeros\u2019. Just for a night, a stop, one day,\
  \ an \"hola, buen camino!\", sharing on the Route of Santiago de Compostela is one\
  \ of the main values \u200B\u200Bof which you are more proud. Because sharing your\
  \ daily life with unknown people is not so obvious, but those unknown people will\
  \ give you a hug even when you are dirty; you will see these people happy when you\
  \ will meet again after days; will be those people to tell you to be proud of what\
  \ you are and exulting in Santiago will tell you \"you did it!\". Returning to everyday\
  \ life after such an intense experience, destabilizes. Because you realize that\
  \ your daily life here is so different: you realize how much people waste time in\
  \ futile things; you realize the superficiality and how much people who has everything\
  \ are so empty because they lack the substance, the soul, the experience, the joy\
  \ of grasping beauty. The only negative side of The Route of Santiago de Compostela\
  \ is that you will miss you so much. This journey was necessary and it was one of\
  \ the best gifts I've ever had. I needed everything that happened to me here: I\
  \ needed to tread the pain under the hiking boots I used to do every single step;\
  \ I needed to give every day more than I had set out to give in terms of kilometers;\
  \ I needed every single person I met and told me what I needed to hear; I needed\
  \ to be conscious that you do not deserve anything, simply things are sent to you\
  \ when it is their time; I needed to test myself and believe in myself; I needed\
  \ to feel pain everywhere and think I could not make it, then wear my shoes and\
  \ start walking as if nothing had happened. Yesterday evening coming back, before\
  \ the \u201CARRIVALS\u201D door at the airport opened, I said to myself: \"be the\
  \ light you would like to find in the others, only in this way you will be sure\
  \ to always illuminate the darkness\"."
