Text: "Travel takes us out of our comfort zone. It pushes us to explore and question\
  \ our limitations, shaping our understanding of the world, and, perhaps more importantly,\
  \ ourselves. So it was for me in late 2004, when I found myself on a 26-day trip\
  \ to Cuba with just a backpack and a camera bag in tow, my first ever backpacking\
  \ trip.\nArriving in Havana on an early December evening, I took a taxi to the house\
  \ where I would stay my first three nights on the island, a ride that plays in my\
  \ head in slow motion on a wide screen. Dim streets lit by old, decrepit lamp posts\
  \ and burning barrels that produced thick smoke, people standing around them, giving\
  \ the city a gloomy aura that blends perfectly with the music that plays in every\
  \ street corner. \nExploring the town during those first three days was easy and\
  \ cheap. Having been to Puerto Rico several times before, I had expectations of\
  \ Cuba which clearly lacked the proper historical, political and economic context.\
  \ I quickly sensed a dichotomy in my perception: colors and sounds were muted yet\
  \ rich in their rawness as I processed and digested the tremendous differences between\
  \ the sister islands.\nNothing would prepare me, however, for the monumental effort\
  \ required to explore the rest of island. Leaving Havana was not difficult, but\
  \ once outside, transportation options quickly became more limited, varied wildly,\
  \ and required vast amounts of local knowledge not available in any guide. The same\
  \ was true for lodging.\nI quickly developed a routine that focused on information\
  \ gathering at the beginning and end of every day, which generally started in the\
  \ middle of the night around 4:30a. I would go to the nearest bus station and investigate\
  \ transportation alternatives, some of which were unexpected: m\xE1quinas, private\
  \ cars fetched by amarillos, military trucks, small buses, and just about anything\
  \ else that could carry people. The combinations were endless and very time sensitive.\
  \ On Tuesdays, a military truck could take you from Baracoa to Moa. On Thursdays,\
  \ a small pick up truck stopped in such an such corner to go from Placetas to Remedios.\
  \ Regular bus service? Unlikely. \nIt was an exhausting exercise, but one that compelled\
  \ me to develop a connection with the locals in a way that I don\u2019t think would\
  \ have been possible otherwise. In the endless hours waiting for whatever vehicle\
  \ would take me to the next town, I learned countless stories of life in Cuba, stories\
  \ that with a level of color and sound that was no longer muted."
