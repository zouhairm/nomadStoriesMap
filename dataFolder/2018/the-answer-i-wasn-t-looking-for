Text: "A red sun spread its hazy reflection across the secluded bay of the South China\
  \ Sea, its rays reaching toward me in a warm embrace as if it knew I needed the\
  \ comfort. \n\nIt was a time for replenishing. After six months of managing an anti-trafficking\
  \ program in rural Cambodia, I could no longer deny how the grim realities of my\
  \ work were gnawing away at my soul. I opted for a one-week vacation on a reclusive\
  \ island off the coast of Malaysia, aching for restoration.\n\nCourteously, the\
  \ island gave me granite peaks fringed by white-sand beaches and rugged jungle hikes\
  \ and soul-soothing moments of solitude. But it hadn\u2019t given me the answers\
  \ to the questions that tortured me: is there hope for our broken world? Can I truly\
  \ make a difference? Is seeking justice worth it?\n\nMy musings were interrupted\
  \ by a woman who came strolling toward me, sandals dangling in hand. Blissfully\
  \ unaware of my subtle social cues that I was in no mood to chat, she enthusiastically\
  \ introduced herself as Carol from New York and delved into her story of leaving\
  \ her job as a tax advisor to \u2018find herself,\u2019 which she seemed to think\
  \ would happen somewhere in Southeast Asia. After explaining that even the Buddhist\
  \ monks in Thailand couldn\u2019t help her locate her identity, she turned the conversation\
  \ to me and curiously asked, \u201CSo, what kind of work do you do?\u201D\n\nVaguely,\
  \ I mentioned my job in anti-trafficking with hope that she wouldn\u2019t demand\
  \ a longer commentary. Her crestfallen face told me another monologue was coming.\
  \ Gathering herself together, she emphatically announced: \u201CThat\u2019s why\
  \ I had to get out of Thailand and come here instead. I was so heartbroken from\
  \ watching children being abused over there.\u201D\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the answer\
  \ I was looking for. But perhaps it was the one I needed to remind me that traveling\
  \ to escape and evade is never a long-term solution, to caution me against being\
  \ one of those people who are convicted by a social issue enough to feel sorrowful\
  \ but not quite enough to do anything about it. Naturally, I\u2019ve never had an\
  \ affinity for watching people at the margins of society suffer from the inescapable\
  \ cycle of exploitation, either\u2014but I\u2019d rather do something about it than\
  \ simply feel guilt and remorse. \n\nI politely finished chatting with Carol from\
  \ New York and walked back to my beachside hut. The sun ascended further above the\
  \ clusters of emerald palm trees, beckoning me to rise up with it."
