Text: "The story takes place in an airport. It\u2019s not an exotic or exciting place,\
  \ but a beautiful one; full of \u201Cgoodbyes\u201D and \u201Chellos\u201D of all\
  \ sorts. It\u2019s a place that\u2019s promising because there\u2019s always something\
  \ ahead of you; waiting. But you\u2019re in between; not fully here nor there. Just\
  \ somewhere in between.\n\nAnd it\u2019s a place where I've met some of the most\
  \ intriguing people. Once, I talked to a barkeeper who had been at the wildest party\
  \ the night before \u2013 he looked accordingly. Another time I talked to a service\
  \ guy who spent his whole lunch break talking to me about spirituality, God and\
  \ the world. He even ended up being late after that.\n\nAnd a third time, it was\
  \ the longest I've ever talked to a stranger. I was so close to my destination,\
  \ but the last flight was being delayed; again, again and again. The huge hall was\
  \ winding down since nighttime was moving closer and at that point, we had come\
  \ together in a group of eight annoyed people who found consolation in not being\
  \ annoyed by ourselves.\n\nAfter the second announcement for us to be patient, I\
  \ let out an audible grunt. I just wanted to move on and not stay there anymore.\
  \ The man sitting in front of me, he must\u2019ve been in his early 20s, had to\
  \ laugh at my deep animalistic noises.\n\n\u201CDid I entertain you?\u201D I asked\
  \ rather blunt, hoping he would pick up on my sarcasm and longing for interaction.\n\
  \n\u201CYes. To be honest, you did. Though that isn\u2019t really hard at the moment.\
  \ I reckon, anything would do the job right now,\u201D he replied, definitely picking\
  \ up on my sarcasm.\n\nAnd so it began: one of the best conversations I've ever\
  \ had. We went from funnily teasing each other to talking about our destination,\
  \ which we shared, to talking about our home, to culture, to politics and back to\
  \ discussing cute puppies; literally.\n\nFrom that moment on, time was flying by.\
  \ It's strange how you can connect so much with somebody you have just met. No promises\
  \ were made, no strings attached, just a beautiful talk that I'll never forget and\
  \ always be thankful for because since then, I love being somewhere in between places.\n\
  An airport is nobody\u2019s home and yet it holds so many stories and fates with\
  \ people wandering and hurrying in its halls every day. I like the feeling of being\
  \ lost in that buzzing atmosphere.\n\nIn Germany, we have a saying: \u201CDer Weg\
  \ ist das Ziel\u201C. Translated, it means that the journey is also part of the\
  \ destination. Today, I know that to be very true and I\u2019m thankful for the\
  \ encounters I\u2019ve made along the way."
