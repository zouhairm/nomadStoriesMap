Text: 'If you are gentleman and you know how to make strange people friend and happy
  with your talk ,simple behavior,connection with any individual including even child
  around the globe then surviving and enjoying your destination is not that tough
  task. sometimes it does not need proper language to understand each other, your
  body language and your smile will do your maximum work.

  Accepting what they like what make them happy and understand them silently and more
  importantly understanding their emotion is very important.

  each and every individual around the globe have almost same behavior, but its a
  country boundary that have created some many differences and different things to
  all these places and within and have kept people to ponder over each other culture
  and rituals.

  If i will have to discuss about my personal experiences , my country is divided
  into 29 states and most of the state have their own language and culture  even they
  have have so many things to complain about one another state. But their natural
  behavior, reaction, biological phenomenon remain constant.

  And the most important things is that no matter which part of the world we will
  stay and with whom we will share our day our work , understanding is very very important
  and you have to feel that you are the part of that community ,sharing good relation
  without keeping any thing bad in your mind.'
