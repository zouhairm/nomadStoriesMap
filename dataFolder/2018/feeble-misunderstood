Text: "I met him on the rooftop of a hostel in Tasarte. Fabien was a very odd and\
  \ feeble old French man, but he insisted that he join me on my overnight hike to\
  \ Playa de Gui Gui; a beautiful beach nestled in the Gran Canarian mountains. The\
  \ trip was long and the French man trailed behind at his own pace, using his ski\
  \ poles to meticulously traverse the rocky path; determined. We reached the top\
  \ of the mountain after a day of hiking. The sun was parallel with us, setting into\
  \ the valley. The ocean was calm, and so was the mountain breeze. The sky turned\
  \ from blue to purple, to pink, and to orange as gold reflected off the ocean the\
  \ funneled through the valley. My heart instantly slowed. The French man unexpectedly\
  \ boomed cries of exhilaration into the sunset valley, and smiled with every echo\
  \ that returned. For the better part of an hour, our gaze was set to the west until\
  \ the horizon was left to a sliver of pink. As we sat, the strange old French man\
  \ told me his story. He had been to the beach before. Upon traveling to Gran Canaria\
  \ from France, he had lost his passport and became homeless, sleeping on the streets.\
  \ Sadly, one night a man woke him and forced him down as he masturbated above him.\
  \ Afterwards, he was beat horribly and was left in a state of shock. The next day\
  \ he retreated to Gui Gui in fear, where he stayed for the better part of a year.\n\
  \u201CI was broken at Gui Gui. I come back now, strong!\u201D He spoke with confidence\
  \ and conviction.\nThe next day we made our way down to the black volcanic sand.\
  \ I raced for the ocean while Fabien appreciatively collapsed into the warm wet\
  \ sand. He let the sand consume him until he was completed covered before turning\
  \ to the ocean and plunging into an oncoming swell. He surfaced and let out another\
  \ one of his war cries. We floated in the sun-warmed ocean and looked up to the\
  \ clear blue sky. I felt my heart slow again, and my breath deepen.\nA little over\
  \ a week later I was back in Canada. My sand filled hiking boots were now trudging\
  \ through snow. I sat quietly on the bus back to Ottawa; the sun was going down.\
  \ The sky transformed from blue, to orange, to pink, and to purple, as gold light\
  \ reflected off of the windows in the city streets. My heart started to slow, and\
  \ I remembered the sunsets, the mountain, the hostel, the beach, and Fabien. I remembered\
  \ how I thought of him when we first met, and how I think of him now. When my heart\
  \ slowed, his raced."
