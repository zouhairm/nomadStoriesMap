Text: "\u201CCome & join us!\u201D A voice approached me while sitting on the warm\
  \ sand, savoring the fresh breeze surrounded by green mountains & paragliders hovering\
  \ overhead.\n\u201CNah! Thanks!\u201D I shouted from afar. \u201CJust come, we'll\
  \ sail in half an hour.\u201D I couldn\u2019t resist asking about the cost.\n\u201C\
  50 liras\u201D, he said. \u201CI don't have money for that, I\u2019m sorry!\u201D\
  \n\u201C40?\u201D I looked up at him with one eye on. \u201CI only have 20 liras,\
  \ will that work for you?\u201D He gave me a grin while heading back to the boat:\
  \ \u201Cfollow me!\u201D\nThe cruise took off leaping over the beguiling blue waters,\
  \ swaying under the golden sun. I watched the boat bustling with people while sitting\
  \ by the bow. \u201CSo what brings you to Fethiye?\u201D He asked. \n\n\u201CWell,\
  \ I have been crossing Turkey all the way to the east passing by Istanbul, Bursa,\
  \ Eski\u015Fehir, Ankara, \xDCrg\xFCp, Diyarbak\u0131r, Mardin, Hasankeyf, Batman\
  \ & Van. Then I went south through \u015Eanliurfa, Halfeti, Gaziantep, Hatay, Mersin,\
  \ Antalya & now I am here!\u201D I answered. He was quite shocked.\n\u201CAre you\
  \ doing this alone?\u201D I nodded. \n\u201CBut how & why?\u201D He was curious.\n\
  \n\u201CA decision I took while going through a major heartbreak. Struggling to\
  \ pull myself together again, I had to get out of my comfort zone & self-heal. Travelling\
  \ was the one & only way out. I had to rush my every decision not to back down.\
  \ A Middle Eastern girl's first solo trip with no fixed plan, no certain accommodation\
  \ & a very tight budget. I challenged myself; mostly depending on local hosts &\
  \ my intuition. Nine Nights of which, sleeping on board buses from a city to another,\
  \ adapting myself not to spend more than a lira or two/day to eat. I had to face\
  \ many hardships & obstacles. I tried hitchhiking, got harassed at times & other\
  \ times I slept in cold dark bus stations.\u201D I explained.\n\nHe remained speechless\
  \ for a moment then he enquired: \u201CDo you have a place to stay tonight?\u201D\
  \ I shook my head. \u201CDon't worry, I'll speak with my crew & you can stay with\
  \ us!\u201D\nAfter spending the night with them, I carried on my journey mesmerized\
  \ by the breath-taking beauty of this country. I got to experience several feasts\
  \ of Turkish meals with all sort of mouth-watering dishes at the times I was hosted.\n\
  \nThe lingering image of our giggles around grill fire that night never left my\
  \ mind!\nOverflowed with hospitality, warmth & generosity of Turks... Motivated\
  \ by their cheering compliments to keep going... I felt accomplished!\nI found my\
  \ lost self in a captivating country, made second families for life & unleashed\
  \ my wanderlust spirit!"
