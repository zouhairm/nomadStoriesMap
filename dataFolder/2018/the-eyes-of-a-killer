Text: "The bumps and jolts of the Serengeti\u2019s roadways were enough to keep even\
  \ the sleepiest passenger awake.\nFortunately, the glorious spectacle of the African\
  \ sunrise ensured I was wide awake even before our safari 4x4 set off. \nThe sky\
  \ shifted from black, to orange, to blue in mere moments; the first light of the\
  \ morning sun threw dappled shadows onto the ground.\n\u201CNow is the best time\
  \ to be out \u2013 it\u2019s when the animals want to get up to have breakfast,\u201D\
  \ our guide told us. \nHis eyesight was extraordinary. \nA guide for almost 20 years,\
  \ Firoz was attuned to the slightest movement of foliage which might betray an animal\u2019\
  s presence; or changes in gazelles\u2019 behaviour indicating an approaching predator.\n\
  So it was no surprise that, despite our tired but eager eyes scanning the undergrowth\
  \ for signs of life, he was the first to spot the mass of golden fur hiding in the\
  \ grass.\nFour young male lions were cuddled sleepily together, just metres from\
  \ our car.\n\u201CSee how their manes aren\u2019t full yet?\u201D Firoz pointed\
  \ as one yawned elaborately, clambering slowly to his feet. \u201CThey\u2019re young.\
  \ They\u2019ve been kicked out of their pride as they\u2019re too old \u2013 but\
  \ they haven\u2019t got their own prides yet. That\u2019s why they\u2019re together.\
  \ It\u2019s very rare to see grown males together.\u201D\nOur cameras clicked frantically\
  \ as the scene unfolded; at once extraordinary and humdrum. A stolen glimpse into\
  \ another family\u2019s morning routine.\nThe first to wake roused his brothers,\
  \ washing them tenderly in what instantly became firmly embedded in my bank of treasured\
  \ memories.\nHe then sauntered towards us, climbing a roadside embankment before\
  \ descending and crossing within inches of our 4x4.\nHis brothers followed suit,\
  \ one by one.\nThe last took his time, ambling slowly, pausing occasionally to stretch\
  \ a leg or shake his short mane.\nHe climbed the embankment directly next to us,\
  \ and stopped.\nMy heart skipped.\nMajestic and fearsome despite his young age,\
  \ his stare gripped me. \nIt felt like an age as our gaze locked, communicating\
  \ wordlessly. \nI felt his intelligence, and I flatter myself he connected with\
  \ me somehow too.\nAt the very least, he understood I was edible, of that I was\
  \ certain. If he wanted to, he could easily leap the six feet separating us, reach\
  \ into the car, and grab himself a decent breakfast.\nThankfully, he didn\u2019\
  t. He broke off, moving gracefully down the bank and over the road.\nHe paused to\
  \ sniff the air, the wind tousling the fur of his mane, looking for all the world\
  \ like an advert for shampoo.\nWith that, he was gone."
