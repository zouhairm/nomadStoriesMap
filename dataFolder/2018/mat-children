Text: "The orphanage. No cameras allowed. No preparation could have been enough. I\
  \ followed the others on my team into a small room where the stench of urine and\
  \ faeces brought bile to my throat. Immediately I saw a square mat, just like those\
  \ I had learned to do forward rolls on as a child, on which lay eight to ten tiny\
  \ skeletons aged between a few months to five years old, barely clothed. A few were\
  \ making little whimpering noises which caught at my throat, however, it was the\
  \ silent babies with their vacant stares which tore at my heart. I turned my head\
  \ so as not to distress the little ones with my horror and noticed that one wall\
  \ was lined with potties, tiny little toilets, on two of which perched naked little\
  \ boys, rocking and moaning quietly. I averted my head in a useless attempt to give\
  \ them privacy.\nMy head was racing wildly, my shock was so great that I could not\
  \ make sense of what I was seeing. I KNEW there were children who were not as fortunate\
  \ as I had been, I had been taught to always be grateful for how lucky I was, but\
  \ my vision of \u2018unfortunate\u2019 was not being able to afford \u2018cool\u2019\
  \ clothes or not being able to afford to eat in a restaurant.\nDenial is most often\
  \ associated with grief, however in this moment, my brain was scrambling frantically\
  \ to back away from all that I was seeing. These tiny people with their bones protruding\
  \ violently, it didn\u2019t seem possible that they could still be alive and my\
  \ immediate thought was that it would be kinder if they weren\u2019t.\nAs the other\
  \ members of my team stepped forward to embrace the children, all I could do was\
  \ fall to my knees at one edge of the mat. I reached my hand out to gently stroke\
  \ the back of one of the little girls who was naked but for a dirty rag being used\
  \ as a nappy, feeling unworthy of touching this precious creature with her almond\
  \ shaped eyes who stared without appearing to see. I gazed into her eyes, willing\
  \ her to SEE me, to KNOW she wasn\u2019t alone and that she could survive, all the\
  \ while knowing that this was a lie, this little girl WAS alone, just one in thousands\
  \ of children at similar facilities throughout China and likely would not survive\
  \ until her next birthday.\nI attempted to comfort my racing mind by assuring myself\
  \ that this little girl would not be forgotten, she, and the other mat children\
  \ would change me, would instil in me a purpose, a lifetime of striving to improve\
  \ other lives. After saying our goodbyes, we walked from the room and numbly proceeded\
  \ back to our bus, silent."
