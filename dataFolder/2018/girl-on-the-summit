Text: "I dream, and the universe executes it for me. A solo trip has forever been\
  \ on my bucket list and in August 2017, I decided to check that off. \nWhere was\
  \ I traveling to - Leh-Ladakh. I lied to my parents, I told them that I was going\
  \ for a meditation course to Leh with a female friend and hence I will be out of\
  \ the network for another 15 days. On 13th Aug 2017, I boarded a bus from Kashmiri\
  \ Gate ISBT to Leh. Nervous/excited? I could not understand.\nI reached Keylong\
  \ on the 14th evening and stayed in a shady dormitory there, 200/night with 3 other\
  \ guys, whom I met on the bus, but I was enjoying the freedom, the trip, company\
  \ of my new friends, interaction with the locals. We reached Leh on 15th Aug's evening,\
  \ I spent 2 nights and a day in Leh, I explored the cafes, the Shanti Stupa, the\
  \ Leh Fort and the local market there. Next day I hitchhiked to Khardungla in an\
  \ army convoy, from there I hitchhiked to Hundur, Turtuk, Diskit but something was\
  \ making me restless. I could not understand the reason, so I came back to Leh.\
  \ \n\nI met a friend in Leh, who suggested me to go for the summit of Stok Kangri\
  \ (20500 feet), it was always on my mind, but Stok is an expensive affair, guide,\
  \ equipment, stay, food everything was out of the budget. So as per my friend's\
  \ suggestion, I decided to make an alpine style attempt. \n\nI started for the expedition\
  \ alone and while I was on my way towards the base camp, I met the army guys. They\
  \ were going for the summit too, they were impressed by my zeal and tagged me along.\
  \ After crossing Mankarmo the battalion stopped for a lunch break and then, their\
  \ Major joined the team, I was resting at a distance from them. He inquired about\
  \ me, and the Subedar Major narrated him the whole story. \n\nWhen on duty, the\
  \ army does not tag along any civilian with them, but the Major let me be. The army\
  \ adopted me on that expedition, my stay, food, gears, everything was very well\
  \ taken care off. I was feeling overwhelmed with so much of help pouring in from\
  \ all the corner of the universe. I was in tears of joy and Major said \u201CCOMBAT\
  \ YOU ARE PART OF THE TEAM NOW\u201D you are home. \nThat was an aha moment, I can't\
  \ explain how I felt.\n\nThis trip changed me as a person, it made me believe that\
  \ nothing on this planet is impossible. 23rd August 2017 a day before my birthday,\
  \ we summited the peak. \"Summiting Stok without money and celebrating my birthday\
  \ at an altitude of 16300ft above the sea level, with the Indian army was the last\
  \ thing I expected.\"\n\nP.S- The Khadoos Major is a friend now."
