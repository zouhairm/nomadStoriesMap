Text: "Shit.  I heard somewhere once that you shouldn\u2019t swim at sunset.  Who\
  \ told me that?  Was it in a film I watched?  \n\nIt\u2019s as sunset as you can\
  \ get.  You know, the textbook magentas, corals and citrus blends that wash the\
  \ sky and never show up in photographs?  I\u2019m at least fifty metres out, yet\
  \ over gentle waves I can still make out the silhouettes of palms and those traipsing\
  \ Palolem Beach.  Will they hear me scream?  The dark fin continues to circle me\
  \ and my heart beats faster than a pickpocket on a train to Agra. \n\nThe lights\
  \ along the restaurant-lined beach begin to wake and I wonder if I can see my accommodation.\
  \  Three dollars a night for a private hut with a beach view.  A coffee costs more\
  \ than that in Melbourne.  I could be back on the beach enjoying a King\u2019s beer\
  \ and eating fresh prawn curry and spicy vindaloo.  Cows would be scattered lazily\
  \ around me and the local tourists would be burying their mates in the sand with\
  \ huge grins on their mugs.  Young backpackers wrapped in sarongs would be discussing\
  \ yoga retreats and wifi connectivity.  It\u2019d probably remind me to email Dad\
  \ (have you ever sent a postcard from India?)  \n\nThe fin just disappeared below\
  \ the surface and I don\u2019t know whether to play dead or begin thrashing wildly.\
  \  I heard something once about trying to punch them in the eyeballs.  Probably\
  \ from the same source that mentioned never swimming at sunset.  Oops.  I guess\
  \ Dad will never get that email afterall.  I won\u2019t tell him about how I survived\
  \ the twelve hour train ride from vibrant Varanasi where I met a local who taught\
  \ me sitar for two weeks; or how I discovered how to make the best Kothi rolls in\
  \ Kolkata.  What about the time that cow impaled my ass with her horn in Jaipur\
  \ and I had to ask a random to attend to the wound?  Or the time I was paid to play\
  \ a cannon-firing British soldier in a huge Mumbai Bollywood blockbuster?\n\nYou\
  \ know what?  It was worth it.  It was all worth it.  India: the place that\u2019\
  s filled with magic, adventure and unique experiences.  You can\u2019t imagine it\
  \ \u2014 you just have to drop yourself in it.  Every day is the unexpected here\
  \ and you\u2019ll embrace it face first.  \n\nThe fin rises again, my heartbeat\
  \ accelerates and I meet it face first. \n\nAnd I tell you, there\u2019s no better\
  \ feeling than swimming with a dolphin that you mistakenly thought was a great white.\
  \  At sunset.  Off the coast of Goa.  On your birthday.  \n\nDad can wait."
