Text: "If the thought of heading down a slide made entirely of ice doesn\u2019t give\
  \ your rear end goosebumps, then the Sapporo Snow Festival maybe for you. Climb\
  \ the stairs of the ice temple \u2014 which is a staggering 20 metres high at its\
  \ tip, or the ice castle if temples don\u2019t take your fancy. Not all the sculptures\
  \ are interactive though. You can gaze up at dinosaurs, marvel at the scale of the\
  \ tank or seek out your favourite cartoon character, mine was Winnie. What is really\
  \ astounding is the incredible attention to detail: scales on the dinosaurs, cracks\
  \ in tank treads, pebbles used to \u2018plug\u2019 up gaps at the temple base.\n\
  \nThe festival is not simply a winter wonderland. It\u2019s like getting lost in\
  \ a very cold version of Willy Wonka\u2019s chocolate factory but just not in technicolour.\
  \ Creations of all shapes and sizes surround you. Some leave you wondering what\
  \ they're supposed to be \u2014 Mr Potato Head but without the eyes and arms? Others\
  \ seem so rudimentary that you think \u201Ceven I could do that\u201D, though probably\
  \ not. \n\nOnsens, natural hot springs, are a much loved tradition and very popular\
  \ throughout Japan. But Sapporo gives you the opportunity to experience bathing\
  \ in the heat of the mineral rich water as snow falls around you. It\u2019s quite\
  \ disconcerting as your mind tries to process that your body is boiling hot in 42\
  \ degrees Celsius or 108 degrees Fahrenheit while your neck and head is freezing\
  \ cold in minus 15 Celsius or 5 Fahrenheit. Just to confuse it even more, you can\
  \ copy the locals and place a soaking hot towel on your forehead.\n\nTypically men\
  \ and women bathe in separate onsens since you soak in the nude. Rule number one\
  \ is to take a vigorous shower before you venture into the water. Rule two is somewhat\
  \ obvious \u2014 it\u2019s OK to make eye contact but don\u2019t stare. If you\u2019\
  re not comfortable being naked in front of others, it can get a tad awkward or you\
  \ can try and hide yourself, or your bits, behind the face towel that they give\
  \ you. Note the word \u2018try\u2019.\n\nThe highlight for me was jumping out of\
  \ the water, steam coming off my skin, dashing to a nearby snow pile and hearing\
  \ the snow fizzle beneath my buttocks as I sat down. Juvenile maybe but fun nonetheless!\
  \ At least I have youth on my side. The last thing I expected to witness was my\
  \ father reverting to his second childhood. He had never seen snow falling before\
  \ this trip and as we left the onsen, he ran and leaped into a pile of snow giggling\
  \ like a kid. \n\nOne phrase sums it up: Sapporo in winter is simply too much fun."
