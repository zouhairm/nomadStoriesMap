Text: "We stood on the tough mountains of Romsdalseggen ridge, hardly believing in\
  \ the reality of beauty in front of us.It was the second day of my boyfriend and\
  \ mine's trip to Norway, when, despite knowing a possibility to delay, we allowed\
  \ ourselves to admire dark blue fjords as long as we wished. Very very long.\nHence,\
  \ we didn't return to a town as planned. That evening, a tiny one-kilo tent, due\
  \ to which our 150-euro 8-day trip became possible, was waiting for its time to\
  \ be put up in the valley. We clambered our way down on the huge stones as if they\
  \ indeed were thrown by trolls...The valley, which seemed plain from the height,\
  \ occurred to be full of stones, with no place for a tent. With a belief that trees\
  \ might have been strong enough to stop trolls' stones, we headed to a forest.\n\
  We were led through the darkness with luminous stones. I started to imagine people\
  \ we've met today, relaxing after the hike.Our path constantly ran away - that very\
  \ path that from the height looked like a straight line.One time we spontaneously\
  \ found it again and... it led us to a hut. \nWe dared to approach. It was closed\
  \ from the outside.Slowly opening the door, I imagined that maybe an animal is locked\
  \ up there, or someone's sleeping, or maybe... But the tiniest room I've ever seen\
  \ was empty. Nevertheless, it was tightly filled with 2 mattresses, table, bench,\
  \ shelf with crockery, and even coffee and pasta, a stove and firewood. Under the\
  \ bed, we found a large chest with toolset and sleeping bags.As we lighted the candles,\
  \ cute curtains on a miniature window revealed.\nThinking it was too late for the\
  \ owner to return, tired and happy, we fell asleep.\nIn the morning we saw English-language\
  \ instructions for a gas lamp.An owner definitely wouldn't need it. Was it something\
  \ like a rented room?.. Soon we've discovered a big book with dated records - with\
  \ the first from 1989! A picture showed that a hut was transported to here by helicopter\
  \ in 1988 as a pass for travelers.For all.\nSurrounded by rocks, rivers, and total\
  \ quietness, we spent next day painting our red hut with grass on the roof, eating\
  \ blueberries, which were all around, and meditating near the waterfall. There we\
  \ forgot about time. If I could have chosen the only one place for a magical transportation\
  \ I'd choose that hut.\n\nAfter the second night, we left. Our tiny tent waited\
  \ for its time to be set up...  But how could we predict meeting Ole, a kind driver\
  \ and owner of 20 houses, in whose hotel we were about to wake up?"
