Text: "A famous Ottoman traveler once wrote that where the Black Sea touches the White\
  \ Sea, the colors of the waters melt, creating a red seam that separates the East\
  \ from the West. This line vanishes only when southerly strong winds blow from Marmaris.\
  \ While I stare at the Bosphorus, searching for that boundary, somebody pushes me\
  \ from behind. It's my turn. \nI nod to the mustachioed man standing on the riverboat.\
  \ He winks at me and fills two big slices of bread with green salad and raw onion.\
  \ Then he checks the fishes on the grill and puts one in the sandwich to serve me.\n\
  The delightful roasted fragrance mitigates the viscous chaos of Istanbul. The sun\
  \ is oppressive and I sit under the crumbling awning on a stool at a small red table.\
  \ I order a bottle of ayran, a beverage made of yogurt, water and salt, and I spritz\
  \ some lemon juice on the sandwich stuffing, as everybody seems to do. I enjoy simplicity.\n\
  An old lady, wearing a black dress and the veil, sits at my table together with\
  \ a little kid, carrying a heavy backpack. I feel embarrassed and they smile at\
  \ me. The lady huddles up with the kid, who takes a serious look to me and says\
  \ a labored Where you from? I answer. Italy? Asks the lady surprised. I confirm\
  \ and her wrinkled hands twirl enthusiastic. Ohhhh, Italy, Italy, Italy. She digs\
  \ in her bag and shows me an old black and white photograph: it pictures a young\
  \ elegant couple posing on the edge of a Venetian canal; a gondola stalled behind\
  \ them; and the Bridge of Sighs on the horizon. She points the finger first at herself\
  \ and then at the young woman in the photograph. Ohhhh, Venice, Venice, Venice.\
  \ She talks with the kid, who looks at me puzzled for a while and then, pointing\
  \ the man beside the woman, says Grandpa. When I smile, the kid turns to his grandmother,\
  \ who caresses him.\nI look carefully at the photograph. It seems from the 50's\
  \ or the 60's: she wears a bright long dress and a wide-brimmed hat; the husband\
  \ wears thick black mustache and short hair. They both stand straight as an arrow,\
  \ the proud arms at their sides. They seem willing to rise as high as possible.\
  \ I would have thought they were mournful if I wouldn't realized their eyes glowing\
  \ with noble joy.\nWhen I raise my head, I notice the lady's wet eyes. She takes\
  \ back the photograph and struggles to smile, but she can't. A tear falls on her\
  \ black dress and I understand that her husband is dead. The grandson puts the sandwich\
  \ on the table, gets up from the stool and kisses her on the cheek."
