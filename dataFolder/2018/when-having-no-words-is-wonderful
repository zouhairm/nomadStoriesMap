Text: "The night porter knows nothing about my takeaway breakfast. At least I\u2019\
  ve got the fruit from yesterday, and to counter this unwanted healthiness I buy\
  \ some crisps at the bus station. Pristina\u2019s traffic is yet to start. The first\
  \ call to prayer is sounding across town. It\u2019s 5:47.\n\nI doze until Prizren,\
  \ Kosovo\u2019s second city, where I see others have joined me, including Wally\
  \ of \"Where\u2019s \u2026?\" fame. We pop into a caf\xE9 where I use the facilities\
  \ and the folk from round here (that is, all the others) get coffee. With sitcom-worthy\
  \ pointing, the driver offers to buy me one, too, but I mime that if I accept, I\u2019\
  ll need the toilet again in ten minutes. An ungracious refusal, but my bladder\u2019\
  s in charge!\n\nWhen we stop for petrol, they all get off to smoke. The gents are\
  \ pointed out to me before I\u2019ve even stood up. None of us can master a sentence,\
  \ but there\u2019s joy in communicating somehow. Wally passes round some cakes,\
  \ conversing with gestures alone;\n\u2018Have one.\u2019\n\u2018I couldn\u2019t.\u2019\
  \n\u2018They\u2019re to share!\u2019\n\u2018Oh. OK. Thanks\u2019, and much nodding.\n\
  \nThe landscape becomes larger, the mountains higher, the lakes more plentiful.\
  \ And we reach the border. The driver collects our passports and goes to get stamps,\
  \ returning in two minutes flat, and we're on our way. The quickest border yet:\
  \ Kosovo and Albania are friends.\n\nHidden in the mountains of eastern Albania\
  \ are the huge remains of the factories that fed this self-sufficient country when\
  \ its citizens were allowed to know nothing of the world beyond. Now, those who\
  \ can afford it may leave swiftly, on a new road that cuts today\u2019s journey\
  \ to a mere five hours. So few drivers use it that ours can train for the grand\
  \ prix.\n\nFar sooner than expected, we reach the coastal highway, where the curtain\
  \ of buildings is constant. There must be one petrol station for every vehicle.\
  \ Ponies pull carts carrying material for the next construction project. It\u2019\
  s no wonder there\u2019s no stopping the boom: until 1991, Albanians couldn\u2019\
  t own property, or even a car. The driver stops to buy some peaches, which are passed\
  \ round and I\u2019m again obliged to submit to the generosity of strangers. I\u2019\
  ve eaten none of what I was clutching at 5:47.\n\nThere\u2019s no mistaking Tirana\
  \ when it comes, because we reduce to a crawl. I lean forward and say the name of\
  \ the central square. \n\u2018Skanderbeg\u2019, beams the driver, moments later,\
  \ gesturing \u2018here we are!\u2019 \n\nHe\u2019s the first bus driver ever to\
  \ shake my hand at the end. He doesn\u2019t have the words, but his smile says \u2018\
  welcome to my home\u2019."
