Text: "A jungle of treasure sits below the ocean\u2019s surface - a mystery that is\
  \ only explored with the zip of a wetsuit, a diving cylinder, and the willingness\
  \ to \u201Cgo with the flow,\u201D quite literally.\n\nI plunge into the seas of\
  \ Coron Bay. Bubbles cluster and rise from my mouthpiece, tickling my exposed skin\
  \ with each exhale. The ocean feels refreshing and cool like the saltwater spray\
  \ off a sailboat\u2019s bow - a welcomed change to the hypothermic waters of the\
  \ North Pacific. Kicking my fins in rhythmic motion, the glow of the surface dims,\
  \ and I descend deep into the underwater world.\n\nToday, I am a fish navigating\
  \ in a blend of blue. I swim between corals, grazing the tips of sea anemones with\
  \ my belly. Creatures of all shapes and sizes, bizarre colours, stripes, blotches\
  \ and textures come to greet me with curiosity. Royal blue and sparkling pink sea\
  \ flowers decorate the floor with colours as vibrant as the world in my head. Distracted,\
  \ I almost lose sight of the dive master.\n\nWeightless, I become a mermaid discovering\
  \ the ancient ruins of Atlantis. My shimmering scales, shells covering my naked\
  \ chest, and golden hair swirl in every direction while I resolve the mystery of\
  \ a hidden utopian society. Feelings of sweet euphoria \u2013 or maybe the rapture\
  \ of the deep - either way, I want it to last.\n\nSuddenly, I approach a massive\
  \ ship and take the role of a respected captain. Coron is famous for wreck diving\
  \ in Japanese ships that sunk during an American air raid in World War 2. Swimming\
  \ with a visibility limited to the feeble rays of a flashlight, I can only wonder\
  \ about the lives that were breathing, fighting, and lost in these wrecks. I check\
  \ my gauge.\n\nRealistically, I am an artist exploring the underwater world. Diving\
  \ feeds my imagination \u2013 a part of me that fell victim to the hopeless expectations\
  \ of academia. For years, I was dipped in anxiety and left to harden. The creativity\
  \ I clung to as a child was hampered by deadlines and restraints on my deep-rooted\
  \ desire to just, putting it simply, really... think.\n\nDiving winds me up unexpectedly\
  \ \u2013 a newfound passion that frees my mind from the chains that clamped it down.\
  \ I bask in my creativity reborn.\n\nToday, I am a fish navigating in a blend of\
  \ blue. Excitedly, I wonder: what will I be tomorrow?"
