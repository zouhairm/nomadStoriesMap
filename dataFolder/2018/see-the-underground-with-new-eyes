Text: "At the beginning of 2015 I moved to Berlin after 10 years spent in NYC. I was\
  \ never fascinated by the metro network of the cities I have previously visited.\
  \ But in Berlin it all changed. I started noticing the shapes, the colors, the details\
  \ and I began researching the deep connection between the intense history of the\
  \ city and the metro system. At the time, as a pure coincidence, I also started\
  \ being interested in the social network Instagram and decided then to combine the\
  \ 2 things together. After a bit of planning, I decided to take pictures of every\
  \ single U-Bahn stop in Berlin (U-Bahn is German for subway) and post one shot every\
  \ day, accompanied by a brief introduction to the station and platform. I would\
  \ mention briefly the history connected to the stop, any meaning of the name and\
  \ why the decorations were in this or that way. Of course not all stations have\
  \ a relevant history or name or design but I definitely did my best to keep the\
  \ readers entertained and engaged. \nThe pictures were done all in the same style;\
  \ a straight shot of the station's name. Most times that includes details of the\
  \ platform's wall, but other times - for example, for overground stops - the name\
  \ would be printed on a big sign standing on the platform. On this last particular\
  \ case, the focus would be on the name itself and the background - colorful or grey\
  \ or very industrial or full of vegetation, etc.\nOne very important idea behind\
  \ the project is that the stations' names and colors are supposed to bring back\
  \ memories. In fact, most of us have memories connected to subway stops. As tourists\
  \ we definitely remember at which stop we had to get off the train to reach our\
  \ hotel, for example. And if we have ever lived in a big city, we do connect stations\
  \ to so many important places of our daily life: work, home, first date, favorite\
  \ restaurant, etc.\nFor this reason, I thought important to have no \"distractions\"\
  \ on the pictures which means that the shots are devoid of people.\n\nThe project\
  \ was very well received. I gained a great organic following on Instagram, I was\
  \ featured in few local and international blogs and finally it became a photography\
  \ book (https://www.kulturspace.com/berlin-ubahn-book).\nI decided then to continue\
  \ my project and expand it to other German cities. I have visited Munich (where\
  \ I also lived for over 1 year), Nuremberg, Hamburg and I have just taken pictures\
  \ of all stops in Vienna (yes, Austria too) - soon to be posted on my channel @claudiogalamini"
