Text: "There are two Saharas for the caravans of eager tourists in bright tunics and\
  \ headscarves who spill across the Atlas Mountains in search of camel treks and\
  \ desert adventures. There is Merzouga, which keeps its exotic promise of mammoth\
  \ pyramids of golden sand, distant processions of camels snaking across its ridges\
  \ like ants marching on anthills. Then there is Zagora, where the level, serene\
  \ landscape belies its grit. I would visit both, but first I set off for Zagora.\n\
  \nIt was August and relentlessly hot, so we met at the entrance to the desert when\
  \ the sun had already begun its descent in an azure sky. Our convoy of camels loped\
  \ steadily across swaths of flat desert interrupted by occasional clumps of vegetation.\
  \ The subtlety of this Sahara attracts a different ilk of travelers. Our group skewed\
  \ a bit older, and though spirited, tempered by experience and travel. We arrived\
  \ at the bivouac, a large tent structure with jewel-colored rugs draped on every\
  \ surface. Dinner was prepared, and conical clay pots of tagine were set out on\
  \ low tables. After dinner, our Berber hosts invited us to sit outside by the fire\
  \ while they sang to soft drumbeats.\n\nI settled down on a small mound of sand\
  \ a bit removed from the ring of travelers dancing around the fire. One of the hosts,\
  \ a soft-spoken young man with twinkling dark eyes squatted beside me and began\
  \ to speak in hesitant English. He was hoping to improve his English; it was vital\
  \ to securing a better job at the camp. He told me about his life before the camp,\
  \ the months he passed wandering alone in the desert with his camels and the stars\
  \ that helped him navigate the pack to sustenance. His onyx eyes locked with mine\
  \ as he quietly confessed, \u201CSometimes I would sing to myself so I didn't feel\
  \ alone.\u201D It was the kind of candid admission between strangers invited by\
  \ the shadows of a flickering fire. As we shook off the sand to walk back to the\
  \ tent, I felt strangely comforted by his revelation, that even engulfed in profound\
  \ loneliness one could sing their way out. It had been the right decision to see\
  \ both Saharas.\n\nA few days later, I would visit Merzouga in a rare thunderstorm\
  \ of blowing sands. The towering dunes were impressive, but the camp of raucous\
  \ tourists and mechanical hosts lacked intimacy. There are two Saharas you can visit.\
  \ Beyond the specks of bivouacs that dot them both, is a third Sahara most will\
  \ never see. There, across the seas of rippling sands, you might detect the faint\
  \ song of the desert."
