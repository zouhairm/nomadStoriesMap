Text: "The Young Pretender is a shimmering gold beer. Brewed on the Isle of Skye since\
  \ 1996, it is a long-drawn distant and joyful prophecy of the kaleidoscopic craft\
  \ breweries which have emerged across Millenial London in the last few years. This\
  \ is the first time these golden bubbles have landed on my tongue, and I am happy.\n\
  \nI am sitting in the Applecross Inn, a white stucco building nestled where the\
  \ Highland mountains of Wester Ross flatten out and tumble into the sea. \n\n\u201C\
  Another Young Pretender?\u201D Murray\u2019s voice is supple, his Scots lilt flickering\
  \ up and down like a bee-bop saxophone. He is the young bartender in this remote\
  \ tavern, whose wry smile and simple promise of live music had drawn us in. We came\
  \ here to drive the northernmost five hundred miles of the Scottish coast, and he\
  \ is amused at our progress:\n\n\u201CAye, the NC500. Ye\u2019ve nae come far boys!\u201D\
  \ \n\nThe 2015 brainchild of the North Highland Initiative, the North Coast 500\
  \ bundles together the lonely roads and ambling lanes of northern Scotland into\
  \ a finite route. A landscape of stunning mountains fall into mirrored lochs, where\
  \ scattered communities make their living in intriguingly varied ways: from traditional\
  \ sheep farming, manufacturing and hospitality, to internet-empowered e-commerce\
  \ selling high-class chocolate. We have three days to drive it, camping in the snowy\
  \ climbs and frosted beaches, before I must be in Glasgow for the 18.39 train back\
  \ to London. \n\nApplecross Bay falls into the sea two hundred miles north west\
  \ of Scotland's second city. The route tiptoes over Glen Garry, a rooftop of the\
  \ world where the dimensions of the earth expand, and around Loch Carron to the\
  \ winding lunar landscape of the Bealach na Ba. Majesty unravels, bend to bend,\
  \ then drops down to a surreal-cold realm of silver beaches, micro-climates warmed\
  \ by the North Atlantic Drift, and the reflection of the setting sun over the Inner\
  \ Sound. Applecross. It was the last golden hour before sunset, we had come just\
  \ 17 miles of the official route, and the shadows of trees wore long over the bay.\n\
  \nAt 9pm the musicians come. The lead singer, John, rocks back and forth singing\
  \ love songs to the land itself in a deep amber voice, like hot toffee over stone.\
  \ \u201CCaledonia you\u2019re calling me!\u201D Welcomed by Murray and his golden\
  \ ale, offered wee egg maraca percussion to become part of the band, and nestled\
  \ snugly where the sky meets the sea, we had been inducted into the warm embrace\
  \ of the inn. \n\nWe were home. Another Young Pretender?"
