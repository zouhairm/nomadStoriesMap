Text: "\"Angels Landing has claimed the lives of eight hikers since its opening. Proceed\
  \ with caution\". Waking up to the Zion Canyon Shuttle audio system uttering those\
  \ words was far from ideal timing on my part. I peeled my face from the bus window\
  \ and sat upright, looking to my friends for reassurance that I wasn't about to\
  \ plummet to my death on this adventure. \"Just don't pull us over the edge with\
  \ you\" was their response.\n\nThe 5.4 mile hike started at The Grotto trailhead\
  \ where we crossed a footbridge over the Virgin River. The first section of the\
  \ hike is a gradual incline, allowing you to look up and absorb the magnitude of\
  \ the rust-colored gorge that envelops you. Much of the first two-thirds of the\
  \ ascent are surrounded by walls of rock and scattered trees, concealing the views\
  \ below and building the suspense of what's to come. Eventually, we arrived at Walter's\
  \ Wiggles, a set of twenty-one switchbacks that looked pretty daunting from the\
  \ bottom. Eager to beat the imminent crowds, we put our heads down and powered through.\
  \ By the fifteenth switchback, legs-a-burning, we were cursing whoever 'Walter'\
  \ was and wondering why he hates people so much. Luckily for him, his Wiggles provided\
  \ the ultimate reward for those who conquered them.\n\nAround the corner was Scout\
  \ Lookout, a spectacular vantage point showcasing the canyon below. Many hikers\
  \ opt to end their journey here, often stopping for lunch or bathroom breaks before\
  \ heading back down the trail. Looking out across the thin, steep ridge and 1,500\
  \ ft drop on either side that lay ahead, one member of our foursome decided that\
  \ the last stretch of this venture was too treacherous for him; he would stay at\
  \ the lookout and wait for us to return. After ten minutes of battling my anxiety\
  \ and fear of heights, with coaching from my friends, the three of us continued\
  \ on.\n\nThe rest of the trail was dotted with thick metal chains and often required\
  \ scrambling up carved steps or traversing slanted rock faces. At times, the trail\
  \ was no wider than 5 ft and every so often we'd have to share that meager space\
  \ with passing hikers making their descent. My legs shook with every tentative step.\
  \ While I was physically in shape, my fearful mentality was clearly my biggest obstacle.\
  \ Slowly, we made our way up the ridge, fighting every urge to look down. Then came\
  \ the pinnacle: Angels Landing.\n\nThe 360\u2070 view took my breath away. We stood\
  \ shoulder-to-shoulder in silence, unable to comprehend just how small we are on\
  \ this earth."
