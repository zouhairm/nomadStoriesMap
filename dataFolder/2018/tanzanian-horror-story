Text: "Traveling has always been my passion but back in 2016 I felt like I wanted\
  \ to add something more to it. \nThat's why I decided to join a volunteer project\
  \ based in Mwanza, Tanzania. I left in October to backpack in Africa for 6 months\
  \ from Tanzania down to Cape Town.\n\nFirst stop, though, Zanzibar: I love my tan!\n\
  \nI had found out about the project online. I was going to be working at an orphanage.\
  \ I was truly amazed by the Country: its colors, flavors, people and well also the\
  \ refreshing \"bucket-showers\" that would make start my day. Fun!\n\nTwo weeks\
  \ into the project, though, I clearly understood that something was fishy. My host\
  \ had disappeared, after continuously demanding for money. He had also told the\
  \ orphanage that I was a qualified psychologist, fluent in Swahili - not true. By\
  \ the third week I spoke with my manager and said I was going to leave earlier as\
  \ I felt like I wasn't  needed: all I did was sit around in the office and wait\
  \ for the day to be over.\n\nIt was a Friday night, my bus down to Malawi would\
  \ leave at 3 am. Stupidly enough, I'd left a negative review about my host BEFORE\
  \ leaving - which made the website block his profile. He finally showed up begging\
  \ me to remove the review. I said I would. He looked mad but kinda understanding\
  \ yet he did make sure he knew what time the bus was. I said \"3 am!\". If only...\n\
  \nAt 2 am I stepped out of the compound, I saw a guy (a guard, I thought) making\
  \ a phone call - and after 5 minutes I had two guys on me with machetes, knives\
  \ and a screwdriver. I had been set up. Yes - they all knew I was going to leave\
  \ at that time, with cash on me and all my stuff.\nI ended up at the hospital with\
  \ wounds on my head and my right hand cut open. And of course: all my belongings\
  \ were gone. \n\nThe day after was a blur: I felt so alone and lost. It was clear\
  \ that my host was involved yet I had to keep it cool because I did need my passport\
  \ and cards back so I could leave Africa. And for some reason my documents were\
  \ found on a grave, sweet!\n\nI made it  to the hostel in Dar Es Salaam, chilled\
  \ and then I remember looking at myself in the mirror: no lies I totally looked\
  \ like a hot mess, but was I going to let this guy stop me from achieving my goal?\
  \ Hell no! I booked a flight to Cape Town instead and kept the trip going and I\
  \ dont regret it.. at all!\n\nIt's been almost two years now. I have let everything\
  \ go, not because he/they deserve forgiveness but because I deserve PEACE!\n\nSafe\
  \ travels everyone and chillax on the reviews ;)"
