Text: "For more than 15 years I lived the life everyone dreams of: residing in a rooftop\
  \ with a dramatic view on the city, travelling all round the world from South Africa\
  \ to Fiji in business class and five star hotels; being in love with a perfect man,\
  \ that kind you plan to spend the entire life with.\nOne night, not different from\
  \ thousand others, Gods decided to punish my disproportionate happyness: my partner\u2019\
  s iphone lighted on the table while he was showering, pop-upping a message: \u201C\
  Good night my sweet love\u201D. My fabulous world crumbled, pushing me in the darkness.\n\
  \nAfter spending months praying my love to save our story, I took my decision: chance\
  \ my life completly. I left the penthouse to trasfer in a rental studio with just\
  \ a laggage and my beloved dog Penny and resigned from a top manager position in\
  \ a International Consultancy. I found a new job in a restaurant where, till midnight,\
  \ I served people at the table. \n\nEvery moorning I look at the mailbook, wishing\
  \ to have no another bill to pay; I go to the market, spending most of the time\
  \ checking the chipest products available. I cannot travel anymore. But I am happy,\
  \ and my new happiness is deeper: I am rich of time, I do know people that I meet\
  \ on the street or I chat with at the restaurant. I learned to smile. Finally I\
  \ meet a man I love actually. I feel to know the real myself. \n\nI stil live in\
  \ the same quarter, just 500 meters from my \"ancient castle\", to keep in touch\
  \ with my friends and my memories.  When I look back or when I am nostalgic for\
  \ the past life, I repeat to myself that is not important how far you go. Few steps\
  \ can bring you to a different world."
