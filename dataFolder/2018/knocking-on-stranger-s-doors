Text: "Amidst cirrus skies and an expanse of rolling green hills - which look like\
  \ the topography of a rollercoaster park grown over with grass, I take a deep breath,\
  \ walk up to a small brick home, and knock. Soon after, the sounds of footsteps\
  \ surface, locks are unlatched, the blare of dogs barking in the background signify\
  \ the preparation of an attack, and the door swings open. I smile and say \u201C\
  hello, my name is Lilly Woodbury, I\u2019m visiting from Greenpeace New Zealand!\
  \ How are you today? Have you heard about Greenpeace before?\u201D A conversation\
  \ with people of all ages and backgrounds emerged from this point, and continued\
  \ on in every direction imaginable. Last year, I had the humbling job as an Outreach\
  \ Campaigner for Greenpeace New Zealand, which meant visiting people in their homes,\
  \ explaining issues threatening the health of their country\u2019s environment -\
  \ like deep sea oil drilling, and inspiring them to make a difference by becoming\
  \ a Greenpeace member. In my time abroad, I met thousands of locals, and found my\
  \ connection to places in strangers whose lives I literally walked into.\n\nAs I\
  \ made my way around the country with Greenpeace, I co-created countless memories\
  \ with people that I\u2019ll forever feel a glow when recalling. On a blazing hot\
  \ kool-aid kind of day, I signed up a grandmother from Samoa. She was so enthusiastic\
  \ to discuss ocean protection and give back to the place she loves most - the Pacific\
  \ Sea. She decided to join the organization because she wanted to do everything\
  \ she could to defend her family and the ocean, which the vitality of her culture\
  \ depends on. After welcoming her to Greenpeace, she gave a vast smile and waved\
  \ her fist in the air and exclaimed \u201Cpower to the people!\u201D She let out\
  \ a shy laugh after, put her hand on her heart and motioned goodbye. As a visitor\
  \ to New Zealand, I couldn\u2019t feel more blessed to have been part of that moment.\
  \ I feel encounters like this are truly what illuminate our travelling experiences.\n\
  \nNeedless to say, during my job there were many ups and downs, all kinds of weather,\
  \ and the only thing I could ever completely influence was my own inner landscape.\
  \ When you have the potential to meet up to 100 people a day, you need to realize\
  \ the spiritual lesson of surrender and ensure your sense of humour is nearby. And\
  \ as I have found out, travelling to a new locale is as exciting as meeting the\
  \ people who live there, and this is where the gems of our journey await."
