Text: "I leave with 17 bottle caps and 17 tailored dresses. \nI leave Tamale, Ghana,\
  \ escorted by a nurse, with a suitcase of banana tea. I take a patchwork blanket,\
  \ fragmented by the colours and patterns we saw every day in the markets. It cost\
  \ me 23 cedi. I take my patchwork legs, torn apart by the scars of mosquito bites\
  \ fading from red to purple to yellow to brown to white. I should have bought mosquito\
  \ repellent but I didn\u2019t. It would have cost 23 cedi. \n \u201CThere is a saying\
  \ in my language\u2026\u201D .\nI don\u2019t stop crying. I\u2019m overwhelmed by\
  \ the sensation of the wooden chair. I'm sick, I\u2019m wearing children\u2019s\
  \ pyjamas \u2013 blue and worn, the writing \u201CMermaid Summer Camp\u201D barely\
  \ visible. Everyone wanted to know if I had been to a Mermaid Summer Camp. \n\u201C\
  I think of it often. Maybe it can help you now. \nWe all know the child we were\
  \ yesterday, but none of us know the adult we will be tomorrow\u201D\nI understand.\
  \ It surprises me that anything helps: I tell her I thought I was going to die.\
  \ And she says, I know, but you didn\u2019t, you\u2019ll move on. There were signs\
  \ I was doomed, I say. I had thought the plane would crash after Dubai. I\u2019\
  d never been afraid of flying but I was far from home, and idea of my body in a\
  \ foreign sea struck me and I made a list of what had made my life worth living.\
  \ \nIt contained more fruit than you\u2019d expect.\n\nThe second time I thought\
  \ I might die came soon after. There was no time to make a list. I pushed my face\
  \ and arms into the ground and pretended I was fine, as if the denial could save\
  \ me. Salma found me groaning on the porch with my head on the wall. The taxi came,\
  \ and the driver helped me into A&E where I collapsed to the floor. I couldn\u2019\
  t lift my head.\n\nIn mornings when we walked to work, the children would shout\
  \ \u201CCinderella!\u201D at me. I never understood why until I had malaria, when\
  \ I went to the school and found the movie. I fancied I might look like her with\
  \ my skirts trailing through the dust, but I knew it was the yellow hair. Salma\
  \ looks down at me on the floor, as nurses push an IV into my erratic hands and\
  \ says \u201Cyou're not Cinderella now\u201D. When the night is over and I\u2019\
  m still alive, Salma helps me wash and she brings bread. I\u2019d had a book swap\
  \ going in the program, someone gives me Dostoevsky which I denounce unreadable\
  \ and have her exchange it for Jonathan Safran Foer. I find myself laughing at it\
  \ during meetings and check ups\u2013 \u201CEverything is illuminated in the light\
  \ of the past. Everything is made clearer by what has come before, you see?\u201D"
