Text: "When you think or travelling you think of sun, sea and cocktails Right? Well,\
  \ I did anyway. Don\u2019t judge! And don\u2019t get me wrong, I was excited for\
  \ the culture too! I just kind of imagined a long holiday where I could relax and\
  \ do nothing. And in an ideal world, that we would perfect! But unfortunately, I\
  \ would have to do work of some sort to afford it all. So I got my researching hat\
  \ on and looked up all the ways my partner and I could save money whilst travelling.\
  \ That\u2019s how I came across woofing (essentially working for board and food)\
  \ and agreed it would be perfect for us. So we joined a woofing site, set up our\
  \ profile, messaged a few hosts and waited. By golly did we wait! It took around\
  \ 3 weeks for a reply but seemed like a lifetime to us! But, we\u2019d finally been\
  \ offered to stay on Waiheke Island in New Zealand and. Egan the countdown for our\
  \ new adventure. \nAs we hopped off the ferry onto this little island it dawned\
  \ on us that we knew nothing about these people. We were going to stay with complete\
  \ strangers! We were crazy?Somehow I didn\u2019t think my mum would be quite so\
  \ pleased if she knew, but none the less, we had an arrangement and were sticking\
  \ to it!\nWhen the car pulled up and this crazy-eyed, redhead with bushy hair popped\
  \ out. I thought there and then that I was destined to die on that island. There\
  \ was no way I was going anywhere but into her dungeon and never coming out. I accepted\
  \ my fate and climbed into the back. I tried to get my partners attention but by\
  \ the looks of it, he too had already accepted his fate and was embracing every\
  \ last breath he had until we were locked away and never heard of again!\nI closed\
  \ my eyes all the way to the house. As we pulled up I reluctantly opened them one\
  \ at a time but nothing could have prepared me for what I was about to see. Hills\
  \ upon hills. Colours on colours, shades of green that I had never knew existed!\
  \ Horses, chickens, cows. The native birds calling in the distance. The smell of\
  \ something so divine that my fear had turned into hunger and I wanted nothing more\
  \ than to climb into that dungeon and eat it all! I stood, breathing it all in when\
  \ I felt something warm grasp my shoulder. I turned, this time seeing an excited,\
  \ curly-haired red head beaming with pride. She smiled, breathed it in as I had\
  \ and went inside. I knew then that there was no dungeon. I knew then that I had\
  \ already fell in love with this place. And began to dreading the day I would have\
  \ to say goodbye."
