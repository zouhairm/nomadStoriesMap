Text: "Her cocoa-stained hands traced the life line on my palm, cooing softly under\
  \ her breath like a pigeon. She flipped my hands and traced the blue-green veins\
  \ under my translucent skin. \n\nBernadette was her name. She wore her mass of curls\
  \ on the crown of her head in a slicked-back bun. Her white dress starch and clean.\
  \ She was the mother hen of the Mopan women\u2019s craft cooperative stationed at\
  \ the foot of the Cockscomb Jaguar Reserve. \n\nCalluses etched themselves into\
  \ Bernadette\u2019s coarse hands. Bernadette spent her mornings helping her brother\
  \ in the nearby cocoa factory. The smell of cocoa wafted off her as she scooted\
  \ through the aisles of handmade wares like it was her own personal fragrance. \n\
  \nThis concrete structure, resembling an abandoned garage, is where Bernadette earned\
  \ her family\u2019s livelihood. \n\nI entered the shop that day to find a guide\
  \ for an evening jungle trek. Bernadette caught a glimpse of my un-sunkissed skin\
  \ and gingerly cradled my hand in her own. The vibrant blue-green tributaries that\
  \ branched down my pale forearm were foreign to her. \n\nShe muttered a few words\
  \ in Mopan and clucked at the other women in the store, motioning towards the register.\
  \ Meanwhile, she steered me towards blue beaded bracelets. She pointed at them proudly,\
  \ to herself and then the tag above them that said, \u201CHandmade by Bernadette.\u201D\
  \ \n\nBefore I could reply, she whisked me quickly towards hand-woven tapestries\
  \ while flecks of blue in the fabric. Bernadette, pointed at the blue fibers, my\
  \ eyes, then towards a woman sitting in the corner. For the next several minutes\
  \ Bernadette shuffled me around the store to all the jade items and crafts that\
  \ had a tinge of blue. \n\nAfter being introduced to all the cool-hued items in\
  \ the store, Bernadette introduced me to her family by announcing their titles in\
  \ a mix of Mopan and English. The last person I met was a man who lurked in the\
  \ shadows. Her title for him was, \u201CLove.\u201D \n\nBernadette fawned over me\
  \ and insisted I sit in the direction of the breeze. The other women nodded silently\
  \ to each other as they stitched, carved and painted their new wares. Bernadette\
  \ would pause every few moments to let me admire her new creation. \n\nI left Bernadette\
  \ and those women feeling inspired. Though they hardly spoke to me, I sensed the\
  \ collective passion which fueled the art cooperative. My visit resparked my own\
  \ ambitions. And, I have Bernadette, my blue-enthusiast friend, to thank for that."
