Text: "Back in 2016 I\u2019d spent the past few weeks roaming in the streets of Vienna\
  \ during the course of my Summer Exchange Programme as classes were scarce and I\
  \ had plenty of time on my hand. On one of those days my Exchange coordinator suggested\
  \ I should register for a course that takes on a field trip to Klikov village in\
  \ Czech Republic, and I thought, \u2018Why not?\u2019\nLocated in the region of\
  \ Jiho\u010Desk\xFD Kraj, this tiny village is located approximately 136 kilometre\
  \ south of Prague, the country\u2019s capital. The context of the visit was, \u2018\
  Analyzing Local Rural Systems\u2019; we had to basically enquire the sustainability\
  \ of the village system. Klikov was formerly a settlement wherein workers of iron\
  \ ore and pottery lived but in the past few years, it has seen a steady population\
  \ decline as many have migrated outside for better opportunities. The village currently\
  \ has a population close to only 200 individuals living there. The region is a biosphere\
  \ reserve as well. Sounds boring? I thought so too! \nMy first day began exploring\
  \ the quite, picturesque village on the amazing cycling track that it offers. My\
  \ cycling rendezvous resulted in bruises on my knees (it was my first time when\
  \ it came to riding a bicycle with gears!) and the chance to see the border between\
  \ Austria and Czech Republic. The evening ended with a visit to an amazing pizzeria\
  \ serving the best Neapolitan pizza at a small place called Pizza U Babi\u010Dky.\
  \ We stayed at a pension house run by an old couple who had an adjacent bar and\
  \ restaurant where every evening was filled with dancing, singing, drinking Kozel\
  \ and exchanging stories from our native countries. \nThe following afternoon was\
  \ spent embracing the wilderness at the now abandoned location of mining and soaking\
  \ in the infinity of nature. While I had least expected that I would, I began thinking\
  \ about the sustainability of the current system of the village. Now, most people\
  \ have migrated out of the village which boasts of South Bohemian style architecture\
  \ (chapel of Our Lady of Snow is a must visit) and the residents are largely dependent\
  \ on running pension houses, hobby farming and its famous clay and earthenware production.\
  \  Nowadays Klikov is famous destination for recreation with various attractions\
  \ such as lakes, surrounding deep forests and scenic cycling tracks, but the fact\
  \ remains that if everyone eventually will move out of this village looking for\
  \ opportunities elsewhere, will it just be another village that just once existed?"
