Text: "To have a mind, cause instead the person will be declared dead when brain's\
  \ death comes even before heart's collapse.\nKeep in mind the mind.\nKeep in mind\
  \ what makes you going on when heart rues.\nKeep in mind that you have a head.\n\
  Everything for a part, allow yourself the heart, but build walls around the mind,\
  \ get your skin dirty and thanks to that, your blood and who makes  it flow.\nYou\
  \ must be grateful to strength for what you're facing. You must not be grateful\
  \ to a cold's annihilated urethra.\nYour brain whispers to you \"Once again\".\n\
  \nDo you know the pain?\nDo you know the terror of give up, to not have a red cent,\
  \ a mind that falls?\nThe seriousness that not makes you breathe. And against all,\
  \ you climb up, a lash of wind brings back you to yourself through the pass. You\
  \ see the green delicacy of Swiss, the fields.\nIs it seriousness  in Italian's\
  \ blood? Education. Sour cliffs against mild slopes in woods pierced by the sun.\
  \ Is all in the mind?\nBreathe, live.\n\nIs it with confirmation that you will fix\
  \ yourself? \nAre we so stupid that we live our life with an ancient doubt about\
  \ the astonishment?\nA lake that sparkles.\nMaybe it will blow.\n\nCompany helps\
  \ climb summits.\nMaybe it will help in life.\n\nI see France and i smile.\nMy Heart\
  \ is full.\n\nWhen everything seems harder, breath peace.\n\nThere is peace before\
  \ the storm but also after that amount of water. A figure of speech. Wrong, unknown,\
  \ we live in preconception, everything is before and we forgot our strength while\
  \ my skin become darker, my armory is there.\n\nYou can wait for her, admire her\
  \ and at last don't give a shit about her.\nIf the rain teaches you that even her\
  \ have need of explosions, who are you to exempt yourself?\nExpress yourself.\n\n\
  You want to stop, collapse, but you aren't fragmented and so you keep going and\
  \ the hail catch you, constant. Pieces of wood shelter you and i think that those\
  \ pieces will be your home tonight. Learn not to hesitate, you have legs.\nMoments\
  \ that you ruminated about \u201CHow am i going back to Italy?\u201D go fuck yourself.\n\
  You will came back and it's right in front of your eyes.\nDo you need other words?\n\
  \nI had going on counting days left and now that everything comes to an end, what\
  \ i will count more?\nNow, what landmark will be in front of me, what rise, what\
  \ sweat, what glance?\nGet it over and live.\nFor real."
