Text: "Vacationing and embracing the true essence of freedom and humanity I get to\
  \ embark on a journey that expands my consciousness and strengthens my perspective\
  \ on life. The power to understand different cultures and embrace new places heightens\
  \ my ability to see life through rose colored glasses. It\u2019s a dream come true.\
  \ I know the meaning of life is deeper than what I see on the surface. Life is filled\
  \ with beautiful adventures and great experiences. Experiences and adventures that\
  \ teach and help transcend my awareness to greater depths and profound amenity.\
  \ Traveling strengthens one\u2019s ability to succeed at their endeavors and I know\
  \ it\u2019s whats best for me. It\u2019s best for my ability to learn about the\
  \ exposure that traveling entails. It\u2019s funny to run across this opportunity\
  \ at a time when I\u2019m preparing to get my passport but I know the universe is\
  \ always conspiring in my favor and everything happens in divine order. The trees,\
  \ the terrain, the mountains, the warmth of the sun, the stillness of the rain directing\
  \ me into a state of solitude and appreciation. The last thing I expected was to\
  \ know exactly how real it would feel to actually experience what some people only\
  \ dream of. I know the journey would be worth every minute. I know what my intuition\
  \ tells me is real. I was made to experience the best things in life. I was made\
  \ to be a catalyst of change and experience so many unique experiences. I trust\
  \ the process and take life by the horns and invision myself in Argentina as I write\
  \ these words. You can\u2019t skip the process it\u2019s all apart of the journey\
  \ and something I allowed to manifest into reality through my thoughts. The power\
  \ to manifest your destiny is truly a great experience. Each opportunity is a new\
  \ opportunity to fulfill your dreams. Passion breeds purpose and there\u2019s purpose\
  \ in your passion. Being in a beautiful place like Argentina will fascinate me and\
  \ attract better things to me. The opportunity to experience a monumental place\
  \ such as this is a major accomplishment in life for me. The freedom of being able\
  \ to travel is awakening and opens up doors of opportunity that will expose me to\
  \ culture, food and attractions that cause a ripple effect of more wonderful opportunities\
  \ to embrace. Positivity is key. A certain tenacity and zeal comes with the exposure\
  \ of visiting a place outside of my homeland. Tango dancing, music and food will\
  \ make the experience more exciting and with the right attitude drive and ambition\
  \ it will happen.Dreams come true"
