Text: "The first call to prayer of the day, guttural and haunting, lulled me in my\
  \ half-conscious state into movement in her direction. My feet soon moving down\
  \ the Sultanamet district, each footfall landing with greater ease as sleep was\
  \ shaken away. \n\nJourneying into her belly during the day is hectic, hot and harried.\
  \ Here, where east and west converge, 15 million thrive and the sense of history\
  \ is palpable. But at this time, all is still. No tourists and subsequently, no\
  \ peddlers with their exotic arrays of oily meats, vegetables and carpets to tempt\
  \ and override the senses. Just an ordinary, dusty street, save for the minarets\
  \ kissing the skyline. \n\nI cross the road and suddenly I am in antiquity. The\
  \ wide, Roman-era hippodrome is pegged with Egyptian obelisks. All is marble. I\
  \ understand this is where chariot races occurred and my thrill is heightened as\
  \ I wind my way along the concourse playing at my own imaginary race. My only company\
  \ at this hour are the stray dogs and few men who slumber on the benches. Oddly,\
  \ I don't feel ill at ease. They pay me little attention. One dog turns its nose\
  \ in the air vaguely in my direction only to slip quietly back into rest.\n\nTo\
  \ my right is the Blue Mosque turned pink in the dawn light. To my left, Ayasofya,\
  \ rising wide and magnanimous in the distance. It is her who I most want to meet.\
  \ She has many names, much like Istanbul itself who has been Roman, Christian and\
  \ Byzantine. Yet I prefer to call her by her Muslim name, in keeping with the Turkish\
  \ tradition. And like many great ladies, she's had a series of identity changes.\
  \ First church, Mosque, now museum. \n\nI circle her twice before stopping both\
  \ out of awe and out of breath to take in her majesty. I reach out to place my hand\
  \ on the cool granite wall by way of introduction and leave it there to rest. From\
  \ afar, she is all pink, grandeur but up close, she feels like a wise old grandmother.\
  \ There is an altogether different sense to being in a place steeped in history.\
  \ You can feel it in the soil. You want to treat it sensitively. To touch it is\
  \ to have some tangible connection to a moment in time now gone.  Later, when I\
  \ would return to see what lie's inside Ayasofya's vaulted nave, I would recall\
  \ this first moment acutely. It is in the moments of quiet and solitude where spirituality\
  \ takes root.  Later that day, when I return with friends to again explore the Sultanamet\
  \ district, and Ayasofya it is with a sense of ease and direction. You see, we have\
  \ been introduced."
