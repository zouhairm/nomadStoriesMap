Text: "The heat lauds over the sand-strewn parts of the world and beats a constant\
  \ reminder of the insignificance of man. You\u2019re barely bigger than a grain\
  \ when all around you is arid and desolate. My husband and I were tearing down the\
  \ Sahara on motorbikes, fulfilling octane dreams of the dusty trail. An unbearable\
  \ slog on the desert road stripped us of all fluids and senses (save for the burning\
  \ of our sun-scorched skin). The endless road had gifted us bubblegum sunscapes,\
  \ starry oceans overhead and ineffable adventure; but now it was our enemy and we\
  \ implored it to let up. \n\nInstead, it led us to an impossibly situated cafe.\
  \ Sam and I were sapped by the unrelenting heat and we shuffled from our saddles\
  \ towards what had to be a mirage. Its proprietor couldn\u2019t have seen more than\
  \ a handful of customers a week. Almond eyes peered through the window and he came\
  \ out to greet us in his native tongue. I fumbled around in my pocket and plucked\
  \ out my bank card \u2013 my ticket to nourishment. The man stood still, unwilling\
  \ to accept or understand this desperate gesture.\n\nSam stepped forward, shaking\
  \ off the impending heatstroke in an attempt to articulate some sort of plea. The\
  \ man cut him off and in a thick accent that indicated these were the only two English\
  \ words he knew, he said, \u201Ccash only.\u201D\n\nBut we had neither cash, nor\
  \ the energy to journey across Moroccan dunes to retrieve it. Our situation was\
  \ critical now and the rising temperature gave fuel to our panic.\n\nThe man turned\
  \ to go back inside. He was throwing up wild cyclical gestures but our heads were\
  \ sunk too low to discern them. Three more words passed his lips that we recognised\
  \ \u2013 possibly the three most compassionate words in the English language:\n\n\
  \u201CMy friends, come.\u201D\n\nThe man led us into his roadside oasis and hosted\
  \ us with that everyman grace so typical of those possess very little. We were fed\
  \ to our hearts\u2019 content and paid nothing for it. A conversation that transcended\
  \ language ensued and was made rich by hilarious miscues one moment and sudden,\
  \ rapturous understanding the next. Language can indeed be barrier and we were glad\
  \ to rise above it.\n\nTrue generosity is not sparing what you can afford but sharing\
  \ what you can\u2019t. This man in the middle of the desert road exemplified generosity\
  \ with no common ground besides laughter and the joy of dining. His name was Moha."
