Text: "A bomb has detonated and the loud screech of the locals can be heard for miles.\
  \ Like a dagger piercing through the flesh, the pain is sharp, swift and unrelenting.\
  \ The communal loss is real, all too real for the wanderer seeking adventure. It\
  \ is not a new sound and sadly it won\u2019t be the last time the reverberations\
  \ of that terrifying invention will be felt. The atmosphere is heavy with the stench\
  \ of hate and it clings to the air like the worst smell you could ever imagine.\
  \ The sour, bitter truth did not appeal to my taste. Neither did it appeal to the\
  \ peculiar minds of omniscient friends. \u201CIsrael? You want to go to Israel?\u201D\
  \  I did and so I did. \n\nThe footsteps of our ancestors, like feathers in the\
  \ wind. Gone but not forgotten, past but always present. They called to my travelling\
  \ ambition and curious nature. For my roots are deeply complex and entwined in the\
  \ soil of a number of cultures. From Africa, the motherland to Israel, the Holy\
  \ Land I felt the pull to the rock of my salvation. \n\nIt struck me as my soles\
  \ encountered The Land the absolute beauty of this creation, a creation as stunning\
  \ as a swan on a lake both effortless and elegant whilst mesmerising and captivating.\
  \ I clutched my bags, held tight to my resolve and journeyed on from the Negev to\
  \ Jericho, From Jerusalem to the Dead Sea. The beauty was not to last. For as smoke\
  \ billowed from the last clash between the soldiers and civilians, I realised that\
  \ hope is but a delicate flower. Crushed under the might of power, necessary in\
  \ the face of adversity. The hope of adventure and the absence of peace weighed\
  \ heavy on my mind. With the promise of Milk and Honey, I pursued the journey. Taking\
  \ each step as a nomad through the desert. It was a sight for sore eyes the incredible\
  \ mountains, intriguing valleys, the ancient cities, the salty sea, and the breath-taking\
  \ views. The words they fail me to speak of the magnificence. A land so loved, to\
  \ the point of death. I was overwhelmed and overcome by the beauty amidst the violence,\
  \ the violence amongst the beauty.  See how the world retains it splendour; though\
  \ we trample heavy footed upon its fruits, its generous offerings, all for our pleasure.\
  \ Hear the weeping of the old and the tears of the multitude.  \n\nThe last thing\
  \ I expected was to come back, the last thing I expected was to fall in love."
