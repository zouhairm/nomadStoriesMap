Text: "Sometimes I find places beautiful simply because they touch the inner child\
  \ in me. Some places make me think, \u201CWow, ten-year-old me would have loved\
  \ playing here!\u201D I spent a great part of my childhood playing make believe\
  \ in my best friend\u2019s back yard. My favorite part was the mini sugar cane labyrinth.\
  \ It was this memory that instantly came to mind as I walked down the narrow streets\
  \ of Anafiotika; the hidden city under the Acropolis in Athens. A magical place\
  \ I wouldn't have found, were it not for my new friend Manos. The town was secretly\
  \ built at nighttime by the Anafi, and consists of white houses completed with blue\
  \ domed roofs and shutters. The aroma of bougainvillea dominates the air. I was\
  \ not expecting to see anything like it until I got to Santorini. I could have spent\
  \ all day there day-dreaming  of how the Anafi children used the village as a playground.\
  \  Manos, brought me back to the present by navigating us back to modern Athens.\
  \ Manos showed me his favorite street art, as he described his family\u2019s struggle\
  \ with the current economic crisis. He spoke of unemployment and impending homelessness\
  \ with an understandable sadness. He said the street art was a way the youth found\
  \ to be heard. \u201CPlus, I think it makes the city so much more vibrant, don\u2019\
  t you think?\u201D He asked rhetorically. I just smiled and nodded, as I thought\
  \ back to the colorful murals that surrounded my old high school. Manos showed me\
  \ where aspiring artists and musicians squat in abandoned buildings. One of them\
  \ a beautiful dance studio with a wall length mirror. As it turns out Manos did\
  \ some Greek Folk dancing when he was younger.  We both laughed at the unlikely\
  \ coincidence, when I shared I used to dance Mexican Folklore. As we reminisced\
  \ about our childhood we ended up at the Monisteraki Flea Market. Manos led me down\
  \ a hidden stairway tucked between two shops, seemingly leading to a storage room.\
  \ I was surprised to find a sandal shop. The walls lined with sandals in all styles,\
  \ but all natural leather. In the corner, the old shop owner sat at a wooden lathe\
  \ machine. Every time a customer came in the owner greeted them with a kiss on each\
  \ cheek and listened carefully to their orders. I of course, had to buy a pair.\
  \ The owner gave me a flyer and told me he could mail me sandals anywhere. I walked\
  \ away with the sandals tucked under my arm, the folded flyer in my pocket and a\
  \ smile on my face.  A much better adventure than my ten-year-old imagination could\
  \ have  ever come up with."
