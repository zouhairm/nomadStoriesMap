Text: "My dad sold our home when I was 20.  He was having some financial crysis. \
  \ With the home he sold my soul too\" He said\nI was waiting for him to uncover\
  \ more stories that were confined to his heart.  \n\nYou see that's the best thing(only)\
  \ about drugs.  They will make you feel less bad about your life.  You will fight\
  \ with your demons, you'll sob, you'll laugh.  And you don't have to answer anyone.\
  \  I just wanted him to inhale every single drop of poison he was carrying from\
  \ a long time. \n\"He cheated on us.  Despite of having his own family he went for\
  \ another girl. And ruined everyones life that were connected with his. \"\n\nWell\
  \ that was something that I couldn't carry on my shoulder for long.  How could I\
  \ say something about a situation that I never went through ! \n\n\"My mother is\
  \ hanging on by a thread and can't forgive her for still loving my father and my\
  \ father ? He just wants it all to go away.\"\n\"I've overshadowed my sister.  I\
  \ distanced myself from them just to stay away from the possible clashes with my\
  \ father. That's why I came to Bangalore. \" \nIt was like 6-7 years of psychotherapy\
  \ in only one hour.  Drug was doing its job.  I could see his upbringing like a\
  \ movie.  His lips trembled, his eyes burnt as he tried to hide tears but we both\
  \ knew he will never revisit those dark chapters again. \n\"I feel the pity in the\
  \ eyes of my relatives and neighbours and it burnt me from inside. \"\n\n\"But you\
  \ don't have to let the night be the thing that defines you, you have the choice\
  \ not to let that happen again\" I said. \n\n\"You see, Nobody wants you to talk\
  \ about being afraid,  or in pain.  Nobody wants to know how it feels to never hold\
  \ your own child,  maybe your father also is fighting for him, against him for all\
  \ the flaws or the mistake that he did. \"\n\"Or maybe not\" he added\n\"Maybe,\
  \  who knows...  But you need to be there.  With your mother, sister and more of\
  \ them with your father.  I'm not asking you to forgive him but you can make him\
  \ home. \" I suggested with a frightened tone that it may hurt him.  \n\" Ultimately\
  \ they want to look on the bright side . they need you to look on the bright side.\"\
  \ \nAs I looked at him,  I saw him sleeping.  Sleeping with tear strains on his\
  \ cheeks,  without being tensed about his soul.  \nMy mother is hanging on by a\
  \ thread and can't forg Ultimately they want to look on the bright side . they need\
  \ me to look on the bright side."
