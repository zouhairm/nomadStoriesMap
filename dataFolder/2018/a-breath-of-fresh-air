Text: "The bells chimed as my fingertips brushed the spindle at the base of the prayer\
  \ wheels. Each rotation a prayer and blessing, a comfort for those travelling through\
  \ the often treacherous trails carved into these mountains, the Himalayas. I remove\
  \ my hood and let the frigid air wash over me, awakening my senses. Today we battle\
  \ some of the hardest terrain of the trek, a 6 hour gruelling mission, a battle\
  \ both mental and physical. \n\nIt is rarely spoken about, but the edge of the crumbling\
  \ Everest trail looks rather appealing at first. The pressure on your lungs increases\
  \ as you gain elevation, sapping the oxygen levels by 30%. The trail is as wild\
  \ as the charging yaks in the rolling hills and the Himalayan breakfast of rich\
  \ milky chai and potatoes is rapidly consumed by necessity in the first moments\
  \ of climbing. Giving up is a thought that often crosses the mind, until, you look\
  \ up. The dramatic rock faces opposite the trail shoot up into the sky as if a God\
  \ has drawn the earth directly up to create a wall. The Himalayan mountains are\
  \ more spectacular than the golden temples of El dorado and this intense beauty\
  \ is but one of the saviours for climbers on this journey.\n\nAt an archway at the\
  \ end of a village we pause a moment to rest our legs and lungs. A chain of yaks\
  \ transporting gas pass slowly by, the wildly colourful blankets and bells upon\
  \ their backs a direct representation of the character of the Tibetan and Nepali\
  \ people inhabiting this land. As I scan my surroundings, my eyes catch sight of\
  \ a pair of pale hands in prayer, painted on the walls. Below, a local Sherpa rests\
  \ his body in silence. In the mountains the entire economy relies on local sherpa's,\
  \ yaks and donkeys to transport food and supplies into the higher altitude villagers.\
  \ Children begin as young as 8 following in their parents footsteps, a life far\
  \ more demanding than I could have ever imagined at that age. The physical strain\
  \ inflicted on their bodies from carrying these tremendous loads can be viewed in\
  \ the faces of many who pass us by. However, no matter the hardship, the incredibly\
  \ joyous and kind attitude and characteristics of these people shines through even\
  \ on the darkest of days. \n\nLittle by little, slowly, slowly, says Prem, our dear\
  \ friend and guide. The sherpa's appear in my mind as we encroach the summit; their\
  \ lives a prime example of raw human strength. And as the evening sun hits the east\
  \ face of Everest leaving the other in shadow and our day comes to an end, I begin\
  \ to understand."
