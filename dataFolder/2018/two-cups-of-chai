Text: "I looked out the barred windows of the suburban railway and heaved a sigh at\
  \ the smoke that blocked out most of my view - not that there was much to see, really;\
  \ just lines and lines of messily glued rooftops and pitiable huts in the name of\
  \ homes, enclosed between a concrete jungle. The sounds the train made as it raced\
  \ on the tracks wasn\u2019t helping my persistent headache either. To think I\u2019\
  d have to sit through another three hours of the constant \u201CGhachak-Ghachak\u201D\
  \ was torture in itself without the summer heat pouring down.\n \nI craned my neck\
  \ to look for the usual vendors that roamed the train buggies carrying small, transparent\
  \ glasses of chai in steel holders, screaming \u201CChai~ Chai~ Masala Chai! Milk\
  \ Chai! Black Chai! Chai~ Chai~\u201D Nearly falling down as I navigated from my\
  \ seat towards the vendor\u2019s dera. A push from here and a smack from there.\
  \ Like sardines stuffed in a can, travelling in the local rail is like being stuffed\
  \ together like Jews in the trucks that were supposed to transport them to concentration\
  \ camps.\n \nIn that little spot, the first two seats, that was dominated with men\
  \ and women alike wearing tattered rags and eating pav bhaji (the one food that\
  \ did not discriminate between the rich or poor in a city like Mumbai) sat the lower\
  \ class members of India\u2019s economy, that still make up more than fifty percent\
  \ of the country\u2019s population. The vendors were all sitting at the entrance,\
  \ legs hanging out of the train\u2019s door that, for some very bizarre reason,\
  \ is never closed. They were all sitting on the dirty train floor \u2013 the local\
  \ rail in Mumbai has snack wrappers, dirty diapers, spit puddles and old newspaper\
  \ decorating the train flooring instead of standard, clean tiles. Holding back a\
  \ wave of nausea, I waved at the man with the tea glasses beside him.\n \n\u201C\
  Two chai please, bhaiya\u201D I said, keeping my balance in the jostling train by\
  \ grabbing onto the leather straps hanging from the bars above my head. I pulled\
  \ out a hundred rupees bill and pushed it towards the man, \u201CMake it fast please,\
  \ bhaiya.\u201D\n \nThe man stared at the bill in his hand as the train came to\
  \ a stop. \u201CLet me get the tea from the stall, Memsaab\u201D he said exiting\
  \ the train with his pals. \n \nI should\u2019ve seen the look of utter desperation\
  \ in the man\u2019s eyes. Blame it on the heat; the streaming commuters that suddenly\
  \ leapt to their feet and started racing towards the train exit.\n \nI remember\
  \ waiting until the train came to life again for the man to return. \n \nHe never\
  \ did."
