Text: "It was 2016 and I was in my final year of pharmacy school. I had the opportunity\
  \ to complete a 4 week international rotation somewhere in the world. I wanted to\
  \ do it in New York. I tried my absolute hardest to organise it in New York but\
  \ after calling over 100 places I was going to give up on the idea of doing an international\
  \ rotation. \nJust as I was about to give up, my mum tells me that her brothers\
  \ wife who lives in Canada, has a relative who owns a pharmacy in LA, California\
  \ and that I can do my rotation with him there. I wasn't too pleased as LA was not\
  \ really where I wanted to go but I thought to myself, hey this is a lot better\
  \ than nothing. \nSo after a lot of work, emailing and phone calls, I organised\
  \ the placement for July of 2016. I spent 4 weeks touring North America going to\
  \ 7 different cities. I then finished travelling and went to LA to start my rotation.\
  \ I was staying in a hostel like Airbnb in downtown LA, run by this guy, his brother\
  \ and their french friend. The first day I got there I was exhausted so I went to\
  \ sleep, as I was going to sleep the boys were heading out. I remember waking up\
  \ to them coming home at 9 am and I thought to myself, wow LA is crazy. \nThe next\
  \ night comes around and I say to them, hey can I come with you guys? They said\
  \ yeah sure. So we went out, stayed out all night and did some hectic drugs for\
  \ the first time in my life. I was high on ecstasy and felt spiritual. For some\
  \ reason at 9:30 in the morning, I looked up the nearest church to me and caught\
  \ an uber there. When I got there I attended the mass, feeling the most spiritual\
  \ I ever did in my life. After the mass I started talking to randoms and all of\
  \ a sudden this guy comes up to me and says to me, hey I'm Marc. I said hey I'm\
  \ Bavly and I just went to church high on ecstasy. He said dude, we're gonna be\
  \ best friends. A year and a half later and we just started a trip around the world\
  \ together. Going to 38 countries in 6 months. Right now we are leaving country\
  \ number 1. We were never meant to meet. Marc told me later that he almost never\
  \ goes to church, he never talks to randoms and he moved to LA from Boston for absolutely\
  \ no reason a couple of months before we met, but we did meet and it was awesome.\
  \ For us to quit our jobs and travel the world for 6 months, a year and a half after\
  \ we met at church, was the last thing I expected, but probably the best thing that's\
  \ ever happened to me."
