Text: "How would you describe 10 days of your life which were filled with thrilling\
  \ experiences, scrapped by boredom at few places, beamed with grateful smiles and\
  \ largely made you say \u2018hello there\u2019 to your inner self? Well, if I would\
  \ have asked this question during the actual days at Spiti (Himachal Pradesh), the\
  \ answer would have been a contrast of sorts. At one night I was happy to sleep\
  \ in my warm bed at a random family\u2019s room and the next day I had my jaw dropped\
  \ because the first thing I see in the morning is yaks grazing in their backyard.\
  \ Yes, YAKS IN THE BACKYARD. In the first few days I realized Spiti has her own\
  \ personal identity. You will see that these people nestled in the pockets of giant\
  \ mountains demand nothing. The abandoned bridges and houses scream of history and\
  \ if you make time to just sit there for a while you will come to appreciate the\
  \ emptiness it holds. The lamas and their monasteries are self-sustained in terms\
  \ of education, faith and friendships. One of the surprising elements is how both\
  \ the sexes work together and have divided their jobs in a fair way. Considering\
  \ the harsh and extreme conditions they live in, the option of delaying certain\
  \ household chores is out of the window. In such circumstances, the husband and\
  \ the wife got to sort out things together. When we reached Demul, we were allotted\
  \ separate houses. As we reached their home, we were welcomed by this smiling lady\
  \ who showed our room and asked if we would like to freshen up and have some tea.\
  \ We obliged and after the refreshing tea, she showed her house and was talking\
  \ about her two kids and how they keep playing and fighting all day long. As night\
  \ drew closer, we were looking forward to chitchat more with her and know her story.\
  \ To our surprise, her husband was in the kitchen rolling rotis and preparing dal.\
  \ We asked him where is aunty (his wife) and he politely said that she has to gone\
  \ to her friend\u2019s house for a baby shower and hence will be late. Apparently\
  \ this plan was decided days ago and she really wanted to attend the function and\
  \ hence her husband took up the task of serving their guests. He added that he will\
  \ be hosting us tonight and is there anything specific we would like to have for\
  \ dinner. This husband-wife duo tops the list of  my personal list of best couples.\
  \ Spiti is a complete package \u2013 a place you got to visit if you need some solo\
  \ time, new experiences or nature\u2019s miracles."
