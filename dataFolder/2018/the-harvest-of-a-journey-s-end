Text: "The olive-laden vehicle had just pulled into a spot along the street when my\
  \ phone began to buzz.\n\n\u201CWe\u2019re being evacuated,\u201D my brother said,\
  \ across a 9-hour time gap. \u201CThe fire keeps coming closer. So I\u2019m in your\
  \ room...Tell me what you want me to pack.\u201D\n\nStepping out into the narrow\
  \ Spanish street, I tried to edge my mind into urgency. An early winter dusk fell\
  \ around me. I struggled to picture it all; I hadn\u2019t been there in months.\n\
  \nWhile my family in California grabbed whatever they could in a flurry, my companions\
  \ in Spain unloaded rubber tubs from the SUV. The tubs brimmed with olives we\u2019\
  d just spent a week harvesting from trees my host\u2019s family owned.\n\nFrom the\
  \ extremes I felt \u2014 exhaustion and exhilaration from wrapping up the work \u2014\
  \ a new pulse emerged. We\u2019d watched the wildfire for a few days but hadn\u2019\
  t envisioned it speeding some 30 miles up the coast to the edge of our neighborhood.\n\
  \nIt was a jarring moment: that this disruption from a flourishing communion with\
  \ nature would come at the hands of a wilder force whipping out to claim a vastness\
  \ beyond the fastest reach of human hands.\n\n...\n\nI\u2019d arrived in Spain several\
  \ weeks prior. After exploring Barcelona and visiting some friends, I found my way\
  \ to a volunteer exchange in a mountain town just outside the Valencian Community.\n\
  \nUpon arrival I was richly welcomed. A poignant precursor to the olive harvest\
  \ was the film El Olivo (\u201CThe Olive Tree\u201D), which my host screened for\
  \ a local women\u2019s group. The story follows a young woman\u2019s quest to track\
  \ down the ancient olive tree her family had sold during hard times in her childhood.\
  \ \n\nArmed with the film\u2019s deep imagery, layers to ward off the early December\
  \ chill and songs and jokes to fill the hours, we began the harvest with friends\
  \ and family members invited to help. My muscles ached; my understanding of Spanish\
  \ grew.\n\nThe time was a marvelous fellowship with each other and the earth. It\
  \ was just winding down when I would receive the unexpected call and be prompted\
  \ to return home.\n\n...\n\nTwo months later, in California, I found myself wrestling\
  \ to make sense of the order of events that had passed in quick succession: the\
  \ fire, the holidays, the mudslides. \n\nOne afternoon, I drifted about our yard\
  \ in thought. We were just up the street from devastated homes and lives, and yet\
  \ here was a day filled with sunshine and peace. \n\nAs I reached out to feel the\
  \ leaves of a tree I\u2019d somehow overlooked in all my childhood play, I stopped.\
  \ \n\nIt was an olive tree."
