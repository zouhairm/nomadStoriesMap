Text: "It was mid-January. It was just after lunch and the sun was beginning to cool\
  \ off. I walked through the bare roads of a village called Thigarajpally in Warangal,\
  \ Telangana, India. I was on a project covering deprivation in the rural villages\
  \ of the state.\n\nI walked alone with a book, a pen and a phone. There were no\
  \ kids running around on the streets playing cricket or hopscotch. They were in\
  \ school. I walked further till I saw a family sitting on the side of the road,\
  \ all smiles and giggles. There was a grandfather, a boy of about 25, a girl of\
  \ 19 and a four-year-old boy. He skipped school because he lives far away and didn\u2019\
  t have the energy to walk there that morning. So, instead, he sat with his family,\
  \ entertaining them with his many antics.\n\nI approached them. As I walked closer,\
  \ their faces went from happy to puzzled. I laughed internally at their quizzical\
  \ expressions and wide eyes. \u201CHi, I\u2019m Anjana,\u201D I said in Telugu,\
  \ the local language. Only the grandfather understood what I said, the others apparently\
  \ didn\u2019t speak the language and only spoke Lambadi, their tribal language.\
  \ With the help of the grandfather, I introduced myself to the others. As more conversation\
  \ followed, the little boy began to warm up and started to inch closer to me, I\
  \ knelt down and began my conversation with him in gestures. His grandfather told\
  \ me that the kid had never seem a camera phone before and that\u2019s why he was\
  \ confused at why I was pointing m my camera at him. I took a video of the little\
  \ boy and showed it to him and he flipped out hysterically. He couldn\u2019t believe\
  \ his eyes. He started running and jumping around, telling his grandfather that\
  \ there was someone in my phone who looked exactly like him.\n\nI didn\u2019t know\
  \ happiness till that moment. I didn\u2019t think something so commonplace in my\
  \ life could make a little kid so happy. He tugged at my pants and gestured that\
  \ he wanted to see more. So, I took some pictures and videos of him with funny effects\
  \ and he laughed so hard he had tears in his eyes.\n\nI had tears in my eyes.\n\n\
  When it was time for me to leave, he reached his arms out to hug me. Kneeling down,\
  \ I took him in my arms and held him tight. His little body felt so comforting and\
  \ pure. New found hope and joy struck me as I realized that if I could make this\
  \ little boy so happy with such little effort, I would be okay.\n\nAll my problems\
  \ didn\u2019t matter.\n\nLanguage didn\u2019t matter.\n\nIt was about the emotions.\n\
  \nIt almost always is."
