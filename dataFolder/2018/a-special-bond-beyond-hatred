Text: "After an almost 12 hour bus ride, I finally arrived at Vrnjacka Banja. The\
  \ journey was long and exhausting, more mentally than physically. \nI arrived at\
  \ the bus station late at night, around 10 pm. I speak broken Serbian, but it was\
  \ enough to explain to a taxi driver about where I was headed. I had the name of\
  \ the hotel where the training I was going to attend would take place for a week.\n\
  The driver said he was impressed by my Serbian, but it was clear I was not a native.\
  \  \n\u201CWhere are you from?\u201D he asked me. \nI\u2019m from\u2026\u201D\n\
  Should I tell him that I come from Kosovo? My country went through a war with Serbia\
  \ several years ago. And to this date, the hatred between the two countries is still\
  \ strong. I am in the middle of nowhere familiar and all alone. What if he does\
  \ something to me?\n\u201CI\u2019m from Macedonia\u201D, I replied.\nIt felt horrible\
  \ to deny my own nationality, but I was scared.\nTen minutes later, which felt like\
  \ hours, I was at the hotel. A young Serbian girl greeted me and introduced me to\
  \ the other participants who were coming from different countries. Five of them,\
  \ including one of the trainers, were locals. \nThat night I couldn't sleep at all.\
  \ I was not sure I made the right decision to go. The next morning I got up early,\
  \ put my Nike shoes on and walked out of the hotel. The place was unknown to me\
  \ and I needed to explore it. Somehow, I connect better with locals if I connect\
  \ with their hometown first. And to my own surprise, I fell in love with the place.\
  \ It was magical. \nThe following days were some of the best days of my life. I\
  \ created special bonds with many of the people I met, especially with one young\
  \ local girl. She shared so many stories with me, including the one about her father\
  \ being killed in Kosovo during the war. It was eye opening for me to hear such\
  \ stories from the Serbian side. I grew up hearing about Albanians being killed\
  \ and assuming all the Serbians were bad. That young girl touched my heart, and\
  \ gave me a much needed lesson. At the end, she said I was the sister she never\
  \ had. She thanked me for listening to her and becoming a role model to her. I hugged\
  \ her tight and I thanked her for letting me be part of her story. I invited her\
  \ to come and visit me, but I could see the fear in her eyes. Oh, how well I knew\
  \ that fear. \nI promised her that I would do my best to make more people see that\
  \ hatred is never the answer. And we promised each other that the history of our\
  \ countries will never be a reason for our special bond to weaken."
