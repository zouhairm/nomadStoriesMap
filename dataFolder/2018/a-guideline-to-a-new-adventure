Text: "Travelling is a dream that does not exclude any person who wants to enjoy in\
  \ life. That\u2019s why I decided to tell the story of my first travel to a new\
  \ modern city. However, I don\u2019t think that travelers know about it very much,\
  \ so I want to share my knowledge of Astana.  \nLet\u2019s start our journey from\
  \ National Airport, which is the first attractive building you come across. Of course,\
  \ a taxi is needed to get to the city center that costs about 1500 tenge. To save\
  \ money, I suggest to get a bus- for instance, Bus 10 -which requires the fee of\
  \ 90 tenge. \nI was surprised when I heard Kazakh people speaking Russian. Later\
  \ I realized that it could serve as an advantage to those who knows Russian. Walking\
  \ along charming streets I enjoyed having sweet talks with native people. However,\
  \ one of the host\u2019s sentences made me worry. He told \u201CI definitely suggest\
  \ traveling around the city as much as you can, but be careful to stay too late\
  \ at night. Although, owning guns is prohibited you may frequently face people carrying\
  \ gun with themselves. No need for worries. Kazakhs are kind and hospitable, just\
  \ do not threaten them first\u201D. Absolutely, this speech was a joke, yet a little\
  \ bit scared.\nThe city is divided into two banks by the Ishim River. Left bank\
  \ attracts visitors with its huge and various skyscrapers. Although right bank\u2019\
  s usual structured apartments look simple, assemble of lights turns them into adorable\
  \ pieces of art at night. Moreover, most of destinations are situated very close\
  \ to each other, so walking through them is possible. Yet, Astana\u2019s bicycle-sharing\
  \ system is also very helpful. Giving the rider an opportunity to move faster, this\
  \ system is ecofriendly and useful for our health.\nAccording to Kazakh people \u201C\
  Bayterek\u201D is the heart of Astana that every tourist should visit. Being an\
  \ emblem of Astana, Bayterek Tower embodies a golden egg on the two branches of\
  \ a mythical tree of life. The top level of the tower features a plaque, a gilded\
  \ hand print of the right hand of the first President of Kazakhstan, in which visitors\
  \ place their hands and make wishes.\nThe largest marquee of the world that made\
  \ me astonished was \u201CThe Khan-Shatyr\u201D which was not just a represent of\
  \ geometric shape of architectural art, but a manifestation of their history entailing\
  \ very interesting tale.\nThis is the end of my story, yet I believe that yours\
  \ is starting at this point. Are you nodding your head? Then, you have done right\
  \ choice. So, have a pleasant and safe journey."
