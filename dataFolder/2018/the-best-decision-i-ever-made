Text: "It was exactly two months before the big trip when it all happened. Eight months\
  \ backpacking around Southeast Asia. The planning of this trip began three years\
  \ prior, I had just moved to university in the south of England, and after becoming\
  \ close to two girls, we began discussing the idea of taking a year out after university\
  \ to go \u2018get lost\u2019 in Asia. So after, what seemed like an eternity, we\
  \ graduated and the travelling became very real. Perhaps too real for them. Because\
  \ two months before we were supposed to leave, I received a message from each of\
  \ them saying they no longer wanted to go. One didn't want to travel and the other\
  \ wanted a safe, overpriced travel experience. And thats ok, but I wanted a raw\
  \ backpacking experience. So out of fear of my big trip being cancelled, I made\
  \ the decision to go\u2026 alone. It was on the flight over to Yangon, Myanmar that\
  \ this decision began to sink in. What was I thinking going alone? You always hear\
  \ horror stories about solo female travellers. But I kept going, even though I was\
  \ filled with anxiety. I had booked a hostel which looked a lot better on the website,\
  \ but I was greeted by a young, and incredibly friendly, Burmese guy, who instantly\
  \ diminished any fear or doubt I had in my mind, just from one simple \u201Cming-gah-lah-bahr\u201D\
  . The first few days were unplanned and stressful, trying to find my feet, making\
  \ new friends and drinking up as much culture (and delicious food) as I could manage.\
  \ I decided to finish off my month in Myanmar in Bagan, an ancient, archaeological\
  \ area, filled with 2,000 year old Buddhist temples. We decided to go see these\
  \ ancient wonders at sunrise. So 3am came around and we all slowly, and groggily,\
  \ arose from our beds and drove our electric mopeds along in the dark. The bigger\
  \ temples have narrow, dusty stairwells built inside to reach the higher levels,\
  \ however they're always filled with tourists. So our destination was one of the\
  \ smaller temples, which means you have to climb the stone temple on the outside\
  \ and hope you don\u2019t fall. Once at the top, I decided to just stop for a moment\
  \ and rather than getting that perfect Instagram shot, I would get the perfect shot\
  \ for my memories. I sat on the edge of the temple, watching the sun rise slowly\
  \ over hundreds of ancient temples, stretching out for miles and miles. I took a\
  \ deep breath, feeling overwhelmed with happiness. I knew that although the decision\
  \ to go alone was a hard one to make, it was truly the best decision I had ever\
  \ made."
