Text: "Talofa was a young Polynesian man from Western Samoa. In Samoan, Talofa means\
  \ hello. I just imagine his parents seeing him for the first time and saying, hello\
  \ Talofa. He had shiny bronze skin, and was built like a rugby player. He moved\
  \ to American Samoa to work at National Parks so that he could support his family.\
  \ I met Talofa through a mutual friend, and we hit it off immediately. On a sunny\
  \ Saturday morning, bright and early, we decided to take on Matafao Peak. We took\
  \ my pickup truck to the trail entry. The entry point to the trail was an old, moldy\
  \ ladder dangling from the side of the mountain.  Talofa jumped up onto the ladder\
  \ like Spiderman with his 40 liter pack on his back. I guess I was doing this. It\
  \ seemed like a better idea when we were just talking about it. We got stuck at\
  \ the first summit, by some vines that had overgrown the path. Talofa ripped his\
  \ machete from his pack, and effortlessly began hacking away vines the rest of the\
  \ way up. Beads of sweat dripped from his arms and legs. A clearing opened up, and\
  \ the hot sun beat down on us. To put it nicely, Talofa was in better shape than\
  \ me. He ran up the mountain with ease. I dragged my legs up the mountain so that\
  \ I could maintain my five foot trail behind him. Half an hour later, we made it\
  \ to the base of Matafao peak. This peak made all the climbing we had done up until\
  \ that point was pretty tame. I was a little shocked to see that the path we needed\
  \ to climb involved some actual rock climbing. I held my breath as I watched Talofa\
  \ begin the ascent. He told me to hold on tight and watch my footing. I watched\
  \ my footing, and I also watched rocks crumble underneath my feet. I watched one\
  \ of the rocks fall off the side of the mountain, and drop about 1500 feet down.\
  \ I immediately felt light headed. I closed my eyes and my grip tightened. Then,\
  \ I heard Talofa\u2019s voice. Come, you can do this, only ten more steps. I released\
  \ my breath and propelled my hands and feet upwards. I got closer and closer to\
  \ a silhouette of Talofa reaching his hand down to help me to the top. Our sweaty\
  \ palms collided, and his calloused hands caused enough friction to stabilize our\
  \ grip and pull me to safety. He hoisted my body up onto the peak of the mountain.\
  \ The sun illuminated the emerald shrubs, and the pinks and oranges of fresh hibiscus\
  \ flowers. I stood by the edge of the cliff and gazed at the entire island. Beautiful\
  \ teal ocean waves, vast rainforest, and breezy coconut trees."
