Text: "It\u2019s barely noon and we\u2019re already drunk off the cheap wine we split\
  \ at the liquor store. Our group of four has morphed into two hand-holding groups\
  \ of two, one behind the other, staggering like a dysfunctional Madeline and company.\
  \ I let go of the hand I\u2019ve been clinging to; it\u2019s started to sweat. Its\
  \ owner, Mike, a Black local with glasses and an innocent smile, is slowly oozing\
  \ whatever he snorted in the bathroom. Molly, I think. In front of me is Emma, a\
  \ twenty-something Australian bartender who reminds me of Katy Perry, that I met\
  \ during a walking tour. She\u2019s pressed up against Mike\u2019s friend Anthony,\
  \ an attractive, ambiguous guy dressed like a European Kanye.  \n\nI ask Mike if\
  \ he wants to take off his hoodie, but he\u2019s in the zone, unfazed, moves closer\
  \ to me so I can listen in to the left ear of the oversized Sony headphones plugged\
  \ into his mp3. He\u2019s been listening to the same shit since I met him outside\
  \ of the hostel, staring into the smudged caf\xE9 window with his friend Antonio,\
  \ looking for a kind face to sneak them a plate.\n\nMike tells me we\u2019re listening\
  \ to Macklemore and Ryan Lewis\u2019s debut album, The Heist.\n\nI wanna be free,\
  \ I wanna just live\nInside my Cadillac, that is my shit\nNow throw it up (now throw\
  \ that up)\nThat\u2019s what it is (that\u2019s what it is)\n\nBy the next verse,\
  \ we\u2019re sitting on one of the upholstered armchairs on sale. Mike puts on his\
  \ hood, nods from side to side. I go back and forth between closing my eyes, nodding\
  \ my head, and taking in the sun and the beats, and opening my eyes to look at the\
  \ people walking by as they stare. A white woman who looks somewhere in her 50s\
  \ comes out of the furniture store we\u2019re loitering in front of. She taps Mike\
  \ on the shoulder. His head keeps circling but his eyes don\u2019t open. I take\
  \ off the headphones he put on me to hear what the woman\u2019s saying.\n\nI ask\
  \ her if something's wrong. She says she's just making sure we're okay, wants to\
  \ know if he's drunk. \n\n\u201CNo,\u201D I say. \u201CWe\u2019re fine. Just enjoying\
  \ the music.\u201D\n\n\u201COkay. That\u2019s fine. People talk. That is all. They\
  \ keep coming into my store and saying that there are drunk people outside of the\
  \ store. So I had to come see.\u201D\n\n\u201CShould we leave?\u201D\n\n\u201CNo,\
  \ no. You can stay. This is my store. It is fine with me. But people talk. You know?\
  \ Gossip. And let\u2019s be honest, you are Black.\u201D\n\nI tell her I appreciate\
  \ her honesty. She smiles and goes back inside. \n\nMike opens his eyes, they meet\
  \ mine. \u201CDo you want to leave?\u201D I ask.\n\n\u201CNo,\u201D he says. \u201C\
  Let them enjoy my blackness.\u201D"
