Text: "Freshman year of college, I wanted to have a memorable spring break. I'm a\
  \ social issues major, so when I saw the opportunity to go on a service-learning\
  \ trip to New Orleans through the alternative spring break program at my school,\
  \ I jumped at it. I was first to sign up and eagerly went on the trip 3 months later.\
  \ \n  The theme of the trip was racial inequality. After a 13 hour ride in a van\
  \ with 12 other people, we arrived in the 13th ward. We got our belongings and walked\
  \ up the steps of an old church. A woman greeted us and led us down a long hallway,\
  \ and into a narrow room with two rows of wooden bunk beds, where we'd be staying\
  \ that week. After getting accustomed to the lack of space and privacy, it was time\
  \ for dinner. We found out that this church was the only building on that street\
  \ to not be flooded out by Hurricane Katrina. The woman that greeted us worked at\
  \ the church, which happened to be a center for social activism as well. This woman,\
  \ along with two others, provided service trips for college students. They planned\
  \ for my group to volunteer with a different organization each day, and then have\
  \ meetings about what we learned, and the importance behind it. \n  Every day, we'd\
  \ go to a different site, and learn about how race effected people around the city,\
  \ specifically after the hurricane. Our first day, we were given a tour of the parts\
  \ most effected by the hurricane. It has been 13 years since, and in the poor, black\
  \ communities, we saw that they still haven't fully rebuilt. However, the other\
  \ most damaged parts had been in rich, white communities that were built up almost\
  \ immediately following the disaster. \n  The following days were spent with members\
  \ of these black communities that rebuilt after the storm in their own unique ways.\
  \ One of the men told us about how the only grocery store they had in that section\
  \ of town had been destroyed during the hurricane. They were left with no food after\
  \ the government stopped shipping it to them. So, this man created a garden so for\
  \ people to plant and eat their own food. \n  Every day, we would get to work with\
  \ these innovative individuals, who showed us how to turn a bad situation into something\
  \ good. They taught us how to fight social injustice, and made us feel like we had\
  \ lived in New Orleans as well. While most college students only get to see the\
  \ party side of New Orleans, we were able to see the fun and excitement, as well\
  \ as the heart of its heritage and people."
