Text: "You know the feeling you get when you start packing your suitcase and you finally\
  \ realize that you are indeed leaving? From that moment, your mind is elsewhere.\
  \ Your mind starts traveling far away, your thoughts become lighter as the excitement\
  \ grows and time starts going faster. \LThat\u2019s what happened to me anyway,\
  \ four years ago when I was packing for Australia. I knew I would be gone a while,\
  \ but I didn\u2019t know exactly how long. \LI had already been to Malaysia for\
  \ a year and that gave me the preparation and the push I needed to leave. \LBeing\
  \ nineteen and going on the other side of the planet for me wasn\u2019t a big deal,\
  \ the big deal was that I was going to see kangaroos, huge spiders and red soil.\
  \ \LFour years later, I had a dog, started a partner visa, became the manager of\
  \ a hotel and even owned a car. \LThe thing is that life is never easy, unless you\
  \ want to stand still, which isn\u2019t what I do. \LFast forward to April 2017,\
  \ I am packing boxes filled with my stuff. I am sad, I am happy, I am excited and\
  \ scared. I feel depresses at times and dubious at others. \LI decided to leave,\
  \ my partner, my dog, my house, the chance for a permanent residency in Australia\
  \ and everything I had built.\LI think some of the saddest moments of my life are\
  \ the ones I remember with great wisdom and that thought me the most. \LI wasn\u2019\
  t sure it was the right choice, but I knew I couldn\u2019t stand still any longer.\L\
  I booked my flight home from Melbourne. Getting on a plane for a 24 hours flight\
  \ after a long goodbye would have been a terrible idea and I was right. \LI cried\
  \ every single tear I had in me, and even if Melbourne is just an hour flight from\
  \ Sydney, it felt like the longest I had been on a plane. \LMy flight was in three\
  \ days and I had some time to say goodbye to the family that gave me my first job\
  \ in Australia. I also had time to take an 8 hours drive on the Great Ocean Road\
  \ and get to the twelve Apostles. \LI could spend hours talking about what went\
  \ through my head while driving alone on those infinite roads. The morning light,\
  \ the feeling when I said goodbye to the children, the hugs and the tears hidden\
  \ to conceal so many emotions. I could feel everything. \LWhen I got to the parking\
  \ lot of the twelve Apostles, I knew it was over for real. I remember walking between\
  \ hundreds of tourists, looking down at the huge stacks, watching the waves softly\
  \ hugging them and everything around me was silent. All the noise was gone."
