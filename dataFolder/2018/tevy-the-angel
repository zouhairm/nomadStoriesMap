Text: "We walked into Ta Som temple randomly, she was with a big heavy basket full\
  \ of souvenirs hung from her little sweaty neck, selling some bracelets, postcards,\
  \ magnets... all printed with Angor Wat images. \"Hello pretty! Do you want to buy\
  \ these for me?\"\n\nI showed my sad face and said I did not have much money, then\
  \ we went around the place to see and take some photos.\n\n\"You really have money\
  \ in your pocket, you lied to me. If no much money, why do you use iphone? So change\
  \ it to buy my things\" - suddenly came the girl, accused and wheedled me at the\
  \ same time.\n\nSomehow we started our conversation. It was a 6 year-old Cambodian\
  \ girl who goes to school in the morning and is a hawker in the afternoon. At that\
  \ age, I was accompanied to school and watched-out by my parents every single day.\
  \ However, what made me truly admire her was that she declared to know 10 languages.\
  \ Well, obviously excellent at English, the others may be good enough to do her\
  \ business, we thought. One of my friends asked if she could speak French, normally\
  \ as a child I would say Yes or No first, then something after; she definitely did\
  \ not make it in that superficial way but responded immediately by counting from\
  \ 1 to 10 in French instead. The baby girl thought that we came from Hongkong, when\
  \ we shaked our heads, she kept on figuring it out with Malaysia, China, Taiwan,\
  \ Singapore, Philippines, Thailand... Eventually I mentioned Vietnam, right away\
  \ baby said \"H\xE0 N\u1ED9i, m\u1ED9t hai ba b\u1ED1n\". We were so surprised and\
  \ happy to hear our language. She proved herself by her own actions.\n\nThat little\
  \ one was extremely glib-tongued. Like treating to some other Cambodian children\
  \ who asked us to give them \"one money in Vietnam\" as a gift, I gave her two thousands\
  \ Vietnam Dong, she refused it on the spot, desired to receive if it was ten millions,\
  \ \"Oh my God\", or else we would have to buy souvenirs from her. Such a smart and\
  \ brave girl undoubtedly inspired these young travelers and held our hearts back\
  \ there then!! \n\n\"Hey, what is your name?\"\n\"Tevy\"\n\"Does it have a meaning?\"\
  \n\"My mother says its an Angel\"\n\n- Siem Riep, Cambodia. Jan 2015 -"
