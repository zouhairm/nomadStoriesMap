Text: "I sat down for my last dinner in a barn in La Pita, ravenous and exhausted.\
  \ It smelled like fried goodness was on the menu tonight, a welcome change from\
  \ the steady diet of rice and beans I'd had until now. I'd only been here three\
  \ days but it felt like a lifetime. Time moves so slowly here.\n\nLa Pita is a woman-owned\
  \ fair trade coffee cooperative nestled in the mountainous jungles near Matagalpa.\
  \ Established long before ecotourism was cool, the family farms pooled resources\
  \ to create guest spaces suitable for Westerners. Each farm has a small concrete\
  \ block structure for up to two guests, outfitted with mosquito-netted wooden beds,\
  \ a toilet, and shower. Visitors volunteer on the farms and learn about coffee production.\
  \ Nicaragua's coffee is amazing, by the way. Sharp, but soft at the same time; bold\
  \ yet humble. Just like the people.\n\nElena was my host along with her two boys,\
  \ Raulito and Miguel. Miguel and I were instant friends. His bright, happy eyes\
  \ enchanted me. We'd played in the yard each day, the truly free range chickens\
  \ constantly running away from us. There was one hen that didn't scatter, though.\
  \ She had a broken leg, her foot curved under. She seemed slow, but I thought she\
  \ must quick or clever to stay alive in this wild place or she wouldn't still be\
  \ around.\n\nEach morning, I picked coffee beans on the muddy, treacherous mountainside.\
  \ I imagined I'd cheated death at one point when a freak thunderstorm appeared while\
  \ we were high up on the mountain. In the afternoons, I tended the food gardens\
  \ and ground corn to make masa for tortillas. It was an intense physical trip for\
  \ this Westerner, but I loved every minute.\n\nElena brought dinner from the kitchen\
  \ and I was ecstatic to see a heaping plate of fried chicken. Apparently, this was\
  \ a specialty reserved for the final meal with travelers. As it should be. It was\
  \ the best fried chicken I'd ever had, and I grew up in the South. I happily grabbed\
  \ a drumstick, but as I took my first bite, my excitement turned to horror and my\
  \ stomach lurched. My drumstick had a small, shriveled, curved foot attached to\
  \ it. I knew this chicken. I'd admired her pluck. \n\nI took a deep breath and glanced\
  \ over at Elena and the boys who were contentedly chowing down. It was just another\
  \ slow, good day on the farm. It was just another meal with travelers. \n\nI returned\
  \ to my food, and silently said goodbye to the bird as I ate, thanking her for the\
  \ sustenance. This meal, this place, this country - it had changed me forever."
