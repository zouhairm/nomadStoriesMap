Text: "A rucksack, an aura of disbelief and three uselessly clumsy friends: a recipe\
  \ for disaster. Stepping onto the introductory train of our rail track adventure,\
  \ I felt like the first man to walk the moon: \u2018one step small step for man\u2026\
  \u2019 I expected a thrilling two week trip around Europe: a colourful, manic montage\
  \ of racing, diving and jumping onto and off of trains, the countries blurring into\
  \ a fantastic haze of wanderlust; swallowing every drop of culture and European\
  \ beer, whilst tantalizing the eyes with scenes of pure dream dust. The last thing\
  \ I expected\u2026was for all of this to be completely true.\nBring on Berlin: a\
  \ city resembling a page from a scrap book complied with magazine clippings of different\
  \ eras, fantasy novels and gritty thriller scenes; Berlin is a bish-bash-bosh of\
  \ vibrant colour, concrete and street art. The nights became filled with warm, liqueur\
  \ tasting memories of red-lit salsa bars and drumming Afro beats and the days oozed\
  \ with sites of thought-provoking history. Thrown from the pop art that is Berlin,\
  \ into the pre-Raphaelite painting that is Prague, we were Dorothy-style, not in\
  \ Berlin anymore and our fresh palette was ready to paint the town red. Enveloped\
  \ in a thick heat, the city is a maze of statuesque, intricate architecture; the\
  \ regal Cathedral rises from the hillside and swan-like boats glide across the glistening\
  \ river. Prague is a true gothic fairy tale. \nCatapulted into blurry Budapest,\
  \ promises of boom-box summer nights echoed from the fairground of sparkling lights\
  \ that reflected in the river across the ribbon of bridges. The sweeping views from\
  \ the hills of Buda exhibited the majestic city: iconic buildings rise from the\
  \ ground with majesty and grace. The famous ruin bar \u2018Szimpla\u2019 epitomises\
  \ the audacious feel of the city: a jungle of shipwrecked treasures, brimming and\
  \ buzzing with a jigsaw of people and drinks; the cacophony of life is memorable\
  \ yet you will be lucky to remember it.\nThe weeks hurtled us from the sea-breeze\
  \ town of Zadar on the sleepy coast of Croatia, where light pulses from the earth\
  \ and the ocean organ sings to the moon, through Jurassic Park style lakes at Plitvice\
  \ National Park, to the sweeping expanse of glistening water that is Lake Bled.\
  \ A Swiss-style village encircled by magnificent mountain faces where a magical\
  \ castle floats upon the lake like a cherry upon glazed icing. \nTravelling: it\
  \ leaves you speechless and then creates a storyteller."
