Text: "Along landscapes that extend among water expanses reflecting the karst mountains\
  \ standing above, I ride the bicycle, pushing myself deeper and deeper into the\
  \ countryside. Rice fields expands for miles.\nAt the limestones feet, beyond the\
  \ water channel, I catch sight of a little home that can only be accessed by a rudimentary\
  \ bamboo bridge. On the exterior, a child plays with a plush toy bigger than her.\
  \ I stop to take a picture. Two men inside the house, seeing me through the window,\
  \ come to it and call me in.\nI sit with them. Immediately they offer me a green\
  \ and slim fruit that I've never seen before, tea and  rice wine follow it. Swallowed\
  \ the last one, they pass me a bong. I inhale deeply until I burn all the raw tobacco\
  \ in it, \u201Cwow\u201D what a blow in the head!\nFor a few minutes I am bleary-eyed\
  \ with wobbly legs, it is like body and mind disjointed. Tottering, I reach the\
  \ entryway to spit out. Thereafter I lie down on the floor laying my hands one on\
  \ the forehead, the other one on my chest, the very affected areas. As soon as I\
  \ catch breath, I raise the thumb and tell to the two guys that are looking at me\
  \ amused: \u201CNgon kh\xF4ng!\u201D, it should mean \u201Cit's good\u201D. The\
  \ second I feel better, I stand up and walk to the fellas. I sit down and to help\
  \ me to recover, they hand me a rice wine shot over as a remedy. Without thinking\
  \ twice, I knock it back.\nThe two mates teach me some word in their own language.\
  \ Writing them in my own grammar, I note down on my diary. Communication isn't easy\
  \ at all, speaking an gesticulating I bring one hand on my heart, saying: \u201C\
  Vietnam\u201D. One of them seems to grasp what I'm trying to express and exclaim:\
  \ \u201CBa co Vietnam!\u201D. Here you go, perhaps this is the expression I was\
  \ looking for \u201Cba co Vietnam\u201D, \u201CI love Vietnam\u201D.\nThese men,\
  \ two humble peasants who recently came back home from the hard day in the field,\
  \ live in a spartan house without electricity, without running water, without mattresses\
  \ and without any insulation to protect against the cold and humidity, yet they\
  \ offered me everything they had.\nIt is staring at the wide open door that I perceive\
  \ the humanity of these people. I imagine it to be always open for you, stranger\
  \ passing by. They will share all they have to partake with you the moment.\nThe\
  \ Sun is low in the sky. I have to pedal 10 miles and arrive to city before dark.\
  \ Wearing my heart on my sleeve, with firm handshakes, I bid farewell to my friends.\n\
  I'd invite every avid capitalist to go to their house to have a tea."
