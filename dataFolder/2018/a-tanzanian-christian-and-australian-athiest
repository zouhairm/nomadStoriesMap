Text: "Altitude-high, and blurry eyed, I stumbled toward the peak. It was late. Very\
  \ late. Or early, I guess, depending on your perception of time as it seemed to\
  \ melt into a block of pain and confusion. It was just me and Oka, my now personal\
  \ guide. Everyone had summitted and passed me on their way down, apparently. I was\
  \ only informed of this later. Stuffed behind my balaclava and seven layers of clothing,\
  \ struggling to move my legs, I had more important things to concentrate on. Frostbite.\
  \ Dehydration. Fatigue. But most importantly, making it to Uhuru, the peak of Kilimanjaro-Africa's\
  \ largest mountain.\n\nThe interminable night began at 1am. Each meter ascended\
  \ seemed to strip you of your physical and mental capabilities, returning even the\
  \ toughest of men in the groups to wailing infants in the face of nature's immutable\
  \ powers. I was quickly left with Oka, stumbling along a thin ridge guarded by glacial\
  \ peaks and volcanic craters. These glaciers we were told were melting under the\
  \ growing pressure of industrialisation and it's toll on our world, their lives\
  \ limited to only a few more years. I couldn't tell what was more breath-taking.\
  \ The altitude, the knowledge that we were seeing something so few would ever witness,\
  \ or the view of Moshi waking up for another anarchic day that only fuelled a system\
  \ which hurt something so close to it. \n\nLeft alone in the silent darkness with\
  \ your own thoughts, it's easy to tell yourself to turn around. But Oka was determined\
  \ to get me there. He'd offered to take my bag, and had literally lifted me off\
  \ the ground when I'd passed out. He gave me his water when I lost mine, and sung\
  \ African hymns that could inspire a blind man to see. He didn't speak English,\
  \ but he didn't really have to. We laughed together for 6 days sharing no more than\
  \ a few words. I respected him, and he understood me. Nothing more was needed.\n\
  \nCollapsing at the peak after a grueling 7 hour summit, I fell to my knees and\
  \ looked at the famous wooden planks that only few humans dared to find. I don't\
  \ remember looking out over Africa, as the exhaustion had taken hold of me, but\
  \ I do remember Oka's few words that have stuck with me. Oka proceeded to kneel\
  \ beside me and whispered in my ear: \"Let's pray.\" The bastard did speak English,\
  \ I thought. Different race, age, and religion. It didn't matter. That's what inspired\
  \ me. We were able to share an intimate moment in the face of something much bigger\
  \ than us, acknowledging the world we both live in."
