Text: "While in Seoul we planned to hike a nearby mountain which offered views of\
  \ the whole city. Baegundae Peak sits at 837m high in Bukhansan National Park. Online\
  \ it says to allow 3 hours to the top. So we planned to get up early, take a snack,\
  \ some water and be back for lunch. Boy was I wrong. Partly due to the fact that\
  \ we started a lot later than anticipated, we didn\u2019t get back until 5pm! The\
  \ walk was very difficult, but just for us it seemed with plenty of old Korean men\
  \ and women overtaking us along the way. It was almost vertical for half of the\
  \ walk. We had no idea what we signed up for. We had no water at the top, which\
  \ did take 3 very difficult hours to get to. We had our snack at the peak at around\
  \ 1, and we realised we had to get down quickly because we had no more food or water.\
  \ On the way down we were rationing what little bit of water we had and a Korean\
  \ couple asked us if we wanted some water. We happily obliged. Then a couple of\
  \ local men offered us some beer! Any other time I would have said yes! We eventually\
  \ caught up with the same couple who gave us water and they were so nice! The wife\
  \ spoke English and told us how they were on holiday from Suwon, not far from Seoul.\
  \ She runs an English Teaching School; she even had a girl from our hometown in\
  \ New Zealand teach for her\u2026 small world! They asked us if we wanted to go\
  \ back down with them which we reluctantly agreed to, we just wanted to get down\
  \ and go home! We ended up taking a different, seemingly longer way down. Instant\
  \ regret soon came over me. Should have just said no and got on with it! But it\
  \ soon turns out worthwhile as they made the pain bearable in a way. They had more\
  \ snacks which they offered us and we stopped to get more water from a spring, which\
  \ we otherwise wouldn\u2019t have drunk not knowing if it was drinkable or not.\
  \ I was so thankful for having met them; Korean people are so nice and so chill.\
  \ I always feel stink taking things from people, especially strangers, but these\
  \ guys couldn\u2019t have cared less. And then to top it off, they bought us some\
  \ dinner at the restaurant at the bottom because they wanted us to try some authentic\
  \ Korean cuisine. This means milk wine (look it up, very different!) and then just\
  \ to put the icing on the cake they drove us to the nearest metro station so we\
  \ could get home. A disaster of a day in terms of planning, an amazing yet challenging\
  \ walk to the peak of a mountain and meeting some of the most down to earth people\
  \ I\u2019ve ever met. Only in Korea!"
