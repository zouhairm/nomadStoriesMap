Text: "Journal Entry: Day 75 February 20th\n\nAnother morning waking up to condensation\
  \ on the tent (bumhair!), but following routine, Brennan and I packed up with super\
  \ speed so our fingers wouldn\u2019t turn into popsicles. We had a short hike today,\
  \ about 7 miles total; piece o\u2019 cake! \n\nOur little stroll on Portugal\u2019\
  s roads would lead us to Coimbra where we\u2019d meet our first CouchSurfing host\
  \ in Europe; a lady in her late 60\u2019s, kind toothy smile, and like many Europeans\
  \ ladies- dressed in her Sunday\u2019s finest. However, this wasn\u2019t our most\
  \ memorable first impression of Maria, THAT was to happen about 10 minutes after\
  \ sharing the European cheek kisses.\n\nAfter all the greeting kisses, Maria took\
  \ us to her guest house where we\u2019d be staying, and went through great lengths\
  \ to explain everything from the key lock to the microwave...yes, she demonstrated\
  \ how to \u201Cnuke\u201D some grub (as my father would say). The tour was taking\
  \ quite a while with all the demonstrations. Eventually we were led to the kitchen\
  \ where Maria was going through some cupboards- but I had completely stopped in\
  \ my tracks. My eyes widened at the sight of the giant, and very detailed I might\
  \ add, penis on the stove. I took a glance at Maria- thank goodness she didn\u2019\
  t see me lock eyes with it. I thought, \u201CDid Brennan see it?...No, it\u2019\
  s best not to look at Brennan, I\u2019m already on the verge of bursting out in\
  \ endless laughter...don\u2019t you dare peak at Brennan! Too late- he saw it too.\
  \ It\u2019s safest to look down at the floor...\u201D the giggle fits were near,\
  \ and Maria was still making her way around the kitchen, getting closer and closer\
  \ to the stove-top penis, until she\u2019s inches away! Maria grabs the giant thing\
  \ with her bare hand and simply states,\u201DThis is a bottle.\u201D\nThere I go,\
  \ gushing with hysterical laughter,\u201DYeahh, right it is!\u201D \n\nWell, apparently\
  \ it was a bottle, some traditional bottle from somewhere; her explanation of the\
  \ penis bottle was lost in the midst of shock and giggles. I had never expected\
  \ this from an adorable older lady- and she made it seem completely normal for it\
  \ to be sitting on the stove. \n\nThis is how our Couchsurfing stay began; Maria\
  \ from Coimbra will always be remembered. I doubt I\u2019ll meet anyone who will\
  \ surpass this first impression. Oh my goodness."
