Text: "22 hours later and I was finally hopping off the over-night bus from Santiago\
  \ to my final destination \u2013 Mars. Not really, but San Pedro de Atacama may\
  \ be the closest thing on planet Earth.\nDeparting Santiago in the early evening\
  \ the day before, the pink sky was touching the tall skyscrapers and apartment buildings,\
  \ kids were playing on their bicycles and both women and men were selling humitas\u2014\
  fresh corn baked or boiled with onion, basil and butter wrapped in corn husks\u2014\
  at their stands sporadically along the main roads. Once we hit the open vast road,\
  \ I was in and out of an uncomfortable sleep despite the excellent reclining chair\
  \ I didn\u2019t expect.  \nI could have taken the easy two-hour flight but I decided\
  \ to save myself AUD $600 and spend $110 for a return bus ticket \u2013 another\
  \ personal reminder to be better organised, but when you\u2019re travelling on a\
  \ low budget, you gotta\u2019 live life on the edge a little, right?\nArriving in\
  \ San Pedro was incredible; it was easy to easy how the surrounding desert is recognised\
  \ as the driest desert in the world. Those skyscrapers I had seen only one night\
  \ ago somehow transformed into a horizon of orange sand and a pink sky. The sun\
  \ was setting; it was time to hunt down my campground to set up my tent for the\
  \ next five days. Fortunately, a young Chilean couple who departed with me from\
  \ the capital were staying at the same site. We quickly joined forces and even managed\
  \ to spend most of my time with them.  \nIt wasn\u2019t until day 3 or so that I\
  \ was on a tour visiting the salt flats and lagoons where I noticed a young man\
  \ in my group. Despite being on his own, his face showed nothing but joy. Where\
  \ he presently was, was a part of the world you knew he would recommend to anyone.\
  \ He was from Sao Paulo and with Spanish both being our second language, we somehow\
  \ managed to communicate between English, Spanish and Portuguese. While floating\
  \ in the salty lagoon trying not to splash our eyes with the outrageously stinging\
  \ water, I was amazed by how much I had in common with this stranger from the other\
  \ side of the world from my home in Melbourne. Wes Anderson films and Tame Impala\
  \ was a mutual adoration we shared. He went on to join my camping pals and I for\
  \ the rest of our time in San Pedro, and four years on we\u2019re still in contact.\
  \ San Pedro de Atacama is still one of my favourite places in the world, but what\
  \ also made it so brilliant was taking time to understand a perfect stranger next\
  \ to me."
