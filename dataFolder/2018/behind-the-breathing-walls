Text: "Walking briskly towards Gell\xE9rt Hill, I debated the decision taken in a\
  \ searing pool with steam clouding both the bath house and my mind. Balazs,Balazs,Balazs.\
  \ I practiced pronouncing his name, the tongue-twisting last letter of Hungarian\
  \ quiet alien to me. His uncanny demeanor had not deterred me from meeting him;\
  \ his willingness to show me his city eventually winning over my wariness towards\
  \ the stranger.\nThe stairs to Gell\xE9rt Monument were still wet from an afternoon\
  \ shower when I met Balazs at our rendezvous. Unkempt thickets obscured us from\
  \ the eyes of bystanders below, while sounds of a nearby waterfall drowned out the\
  \ cacophony of the traffic passing through Erzs\xE9bet hid.\nAs we climbed higher,\
  \ Balazs told me the tale of \xD3buda, Buda and Pest, three cities that were merged\
  \ into one. His palpable recounting of the gory past of Budapest transported me\
  \ from one era to another through his words. At one moment I was standing amongst\
  \ an angry mob that threw a saint down this hill; in the next I was deported out\
  \ of my own country, my identity dissolved by mere signing of a treaty. And then\
  \ the scene shifted, and I was witnessing the shooting of barefoot innocents on\
  \ the bank of Danube. Sound of bullets reverberated through the air as the water\
  \ of the silvery river turned into blood. \nI walked through streets with dilapidated\
  \ buildings with children peering down windows with expressionless faces. I shouted\
  \ slogans alongside a teenage Balazs demanding my liberators to leave my country.\
  \ I saw devastation all around me,my city crippled by starvation,mass rape and slaughter.\n\
  As the last piece of the puzzle fit in, I could finally understand what was missing\
  \ in Balazs. \nCaught in a vicious cycle of invasions for centuries,Balazs like\
  \ many of his countrymen,had forgotten the art of smiling somewhere along the conquests\
  \ of strangers. He was wary of outsider in his lands; the walls around him painted\
  \ with expressions of anguish passed down through generations.\nBalazs was not speaking\
  \ anymore. Something in the distance had caught his attention that compelled me\
  \ to follow his gaze. Far below in the growing darkness of twilight,Budapest was\
  \ lighting up in a triumphant glow as a flock of gulls circled the dome of the Hungarian\
  \ Parliament.\nI told Balazs how the phenomenon seemed symbolic of a city spreading\
  \ its wings, standing strong and proud of its freedom.\n\u201CYes, we are\u201D\
  , he said and then for the first time in the course of the day, he smiled. The walls\
  \ were crumbling."
