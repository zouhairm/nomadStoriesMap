Text: "Darkness descended over the arid hills, and a storm seemed close. We needed\
  \ to get back and pitch our tent quickly or be at the mercy of the incoming southeasterly.\
  \ \n\nIn an instant, great sheets of water plummeted from the heavens and despite\
  \ a ferocious effort from the wipers, we could barely see the front of the car as\
  \ we raced for shelter. The road ahead was sporadically illuminated by lightning.\
  \ A cacophony boomed all around. Suddenly, CRASH! A great wave of water rolled over\
  \ the hood, splashed up onto the windshield, and we felt the car lift from the ground.\
  \ As the engine failed and the lights spluttered out, we began to float off the\
  \ road down this flood-born river. What do we do, what do we do?\n\nI knew we needed\
  \ to get out of the car, but the decision to open the door into the now-window-height\
  \ water felt preposterous. \n\nWater rushed into the car, and I was barely able\
  \ to close the door again. Firmly planted in his seat, the captain appeared to be\
  \ ready to go down with the ship. As I worked my way around the car to place my\
  \ hands on the hood, visions of great snakes or crocodiles closing in, or being\
  \ fried by one of the many forked tongues of Thor\u2019s Hammer clouded my mind.\
  \ Standing in waist deep water? Check. Hands on metal car? Check. Bare feet grounded?\
  \ Check.\n\nThrough what felt like Herculean effort (likely aided by the vehicle\u2019\
  s small size), I managed to get the car out of the river and back onto the road.\
  \ It was late, we were in one of the most isolated parts of northwestern Australia,\
  \ at least 40 kilometres from the nearest building, with no working means of communication.\
  \ We sat there for what felt like three years.\n\nThen, headlights.\n\nMy mind is\
  \ a blur and I can\u2019t remember his name, but Gazza, or Rusty, or Mick had come\
  \ to save us. He made short work of crossing our impassable river in his truck,\
  \ and thank whatever God had sent him to us for his automotive prowess, as he managed\
  \ to clear the water and jump start our battery.\n\n\u201CJust one more thing.\u201D\
  \n\nHe emerged from his vehicle wielding a machete. I resisted the urge to make\
  \ a \u201Cthat\u2019s not a knife\u201D joke, lest this proverbial character become\
  \ our Wolf Creek nightmare.\n\n\u201CYou\u2019ll need to cut it off.\u201D\n\nFortunately\
  \ he was referring to the plastic cover now hanging from the undercarriage. I hacked\
  \ it off, and we were back in action. Knowing only one safe option, with our hearts\
  \ firmly in throat, we crawled back to the station at the edge of Karijini and prayed\
  \ for respite to come with the dawn."
