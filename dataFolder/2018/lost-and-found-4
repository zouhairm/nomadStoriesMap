Text: "After the fade of the revolution's glory, everything in the country returned\
  \ to what it used to be for ages with one major difference surrounding the necks\
  \ and the brains of the youth \"Indifference\", she tried hard to embrace her failures\
  \ and her lost hopes by working hard endlessly.\nHer manager never failed to surprise\
  \ her with his awkwardness, his soul has gone rust since ages and he forgot how\
  \ to thank anybody for anything ,it was end of March and this march she has been\
  \ in deep agony after breaking up with her soulmate ,he left just like all the things\
  \ and the ones who left her lost in the middle of nowhere .\nA friend from her political\
  \ party called to have her approval since she was nominated to join a cross-cultural\
  \ program at Georgia, short in vacations and fearing the confrontation with her\
  \ manager she was going to refuse so she asked for a couple of days to confirm.\n\
  Ten days after, she was on the board of the plane to Georgia and then tears started\
  \ to shed its rain, her soul and heart were broken and she badly needed to see strangers,\
  \ to wash her agony in some random streets and to have the current page over.\n\
  Arriving in Tbilisi by midnight, she started to relax enjoying the fresh breeze\
  \ and the dazzling beauty of the streets going steeply up and taking her soul along,\
  \ on the second day of the program she led her team on a mission of exploring Bakuriani,\
  \ a city that words are not enough to describe it's uniqueness being on top of a\
  \ mountain ,it's sky was clear as a loving heart and it's streets once covered with\
  \ snow turned to be an opera stage ,the team was a group of delighting youth from\
  \ seven different countries passing the whole day together while sharing great moments\
  \ of laughter, thought and even doubt .\nThe mission of the team was to take a photo\
  \ with a group of the locals and then votes would determine the winner, the upcoming\
  \ moment will remain an eternal one in her memory, a man who looked very miserable\
  \ pulling his horse behind brought to her memory all the previous agonies \nShe\
  \ went to him and told him about the importance of the photo for her team and that\
  \ it would be a real favor if he accepted, he remained silent until he said \"Today,\
  \ I am paying back for the smile I saw in your eyes ,i'll teach the team the local\
  \ dance of Bakuriani and you can then shoot a video not only a photo \" while dancing,\
  \ she was dropping all her self-doubts and tasting pure happiness ,she regained\
  \ her trust in humanity ."
