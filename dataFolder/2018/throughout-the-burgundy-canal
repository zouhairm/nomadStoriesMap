Text: "We were pedalling with the saddlebags full of our nerves and the concerns about\
  \ the travel under the midday sun of the 7th of August. Reached the train station,\
  \ we felt nearer our destination; we would have never imagined that, actually, it\
  \ was not as far as we thought. \n\nAfter an abrupt shunting, some electric problems\
  \ and a run over animal in the line, we missed the connection to the Danube. Who\
  \ knows what could have happened if the destiny or the fate had not intervened in\
  \ favour of us?  Suddenly, the way drove us towards a similar route in French lands.\
  \ \nIn Migennes as starting line, 8 stages throughout fairytale forests and around\
  \ 180 locks were waiting for us, with all the adventures and misfortunes that an\
  \ improvised travel entails. The luggage weighed, but even more our spirit. We kept\
  \ the pace of 30 kilometres a day, while we left on the edge of the Burgundy Canal\
  \ some charming villages with lovely houses, many of them named as \"villes fleuris\"\
  .  \n\nWhen the king of the sky had already been hidden, which did not dressed up\
  \ all its splendour till one of the last days, while its cotton mates went with\
  \ us for a big part of way, each night in any isolated campsite, inside the tent,\
  \ or in any \"g\xEEte\" we recalled all the visits and happenings of the day: costumbrist\
  \ pictures of harbours and piers, magnificent but tiny town halls, legendary fountains,\
  \ ancient washing places, which were used fifty years ago, historical markets, churches\
  \ from all times, \"ch\xE2teaux\" and abbeys, beautiful viewpoints that had been\
  \ witnesses to wars and love stories, millennial bridges\u2026 \n\nLong days, in\
  \ which we rode with the \"baguettes\" in the French style \u2014on the back saddlebags\u2014\
  , in which the only sound that broke the great silence was the water flow or any\
  \ sweet-sounding bonjour by any cyclist who got us mixed up with French people.\
  \ Even if they were good or bad omen, ravens crossed the sky that covered the well-known\
  \ vineyards, which give suitable wine for all palates of the region and beyond.\
  \ The landscape was becoming little by little southerner and the distances between\
  \ towns enlarged. \n\nWith our feet firmly on the ground and not on the bike pedals,\
  \ we felt the presence of the end of the Burgundy Canal; we crossed the border between\
  \ the countryside and the city and we reached the finish line of the route: Dijon,\
  \ a city which received us with a lively university life."
