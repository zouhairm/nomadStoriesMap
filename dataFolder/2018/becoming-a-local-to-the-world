Text: "Are we that different from each other after all?\n\n Anyone that has enough\
  \ courage to travel, has a different reason why they do it. Mine started at a small\
  \ age when my parents taught me: \u201CYou can read or hear anything, but you won\u2019\
  t learn until you see it.\u201D I wanted to see new streets, new sights to look\
  \ at, and new buildings to stare.  As I grew old to be a teenager I wanted to travel\
  \ to escape. I traveled to get to know myself, and to get away from my problems.\
  \ To get out of my comfort zone.\n\n The more I get to know myself, the more I wanted\
  \ to meet new people. Traveling alone to meet the locals became a hobby. In no time\
  \ I found myself traveling for a question: Are we that different from each other?\n\
  \nThus far, I knew about the USA as much as I heard and read. They always seemed\
  \ so different to me by their concept of community. Their lifestyle, school life,\
  \ urban structure\u2026 the people. So I decided if I would go on a trip for an\
  \ answer, that would be the location. From the moment I secretly applied for an\
  \ exchange program by the time I flew to San Diego felt like a second.\n\n Halfway\
  \ through my trip of a year, I already felt that I was a local, we made bonfires\
  \ on the beach, I became one of those cheerleaders that I saw at the movies, I felt\
  \ nervous about the prom which ended up as countless hours of fun. As I made new\
  \ local connections, I also felt like one.\n\n I got used to living there and they\
  \ were getting used to me like I was no stranger months ago. One day, when we were\
  \ hiking as we did every week with my friend Kenzie, \u201CIs it that similar of\
  \ a life do you have in Turkey?\u201D she asked.\n\n I understood what the answer\
  \ of my question was. No, we weren\u2019t different, as long as people will keep\
  \ traveling to discover, and keep talking to connect with each other.\n\n The thing\
  \ is that, the people had the same questions I had about them; and the friendship\
  \ I made with them, they made it with me. The culture that you grow up in, can change,\
  \ as much as your language, your beliefs, or your community. While we consider these\
  \ small differences we tend to forget that we all are actually locals of the same\
  \ world.\n\n What I learned from this trip was as long as you have enough passion\
  \ in you to get to know anyone, you can befriend anyone, because we\u2019re not\
  \ that different from each other."
