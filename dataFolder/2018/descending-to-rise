Text: "I\u2019ve had a recurring dream for years. In my dream, my bones were flexible\
  \ and I was slithering through small tunnels underneath the earth, with the space\
  \ slowly but steadily closing in on me. The dream was a claustrophobic nightmare,\
  \ the kind of dream you try to brush away with a shudder when rubbing the sleep\
  \ out of your eyes. \nAnd yet here I was. I must obviously be mad, because no amount\
  \ of rubbing my eyes would get me out of this situation. Instead, I was hesitantly\
  \ shining my head torch ten meters down a narrow crevice that was sometimes hardly\
  \ wider than my own body.\nI was merely shaking legs and beating heart and they\
  \ happened to be situated dozens of meters underneath the ground of Malaysian Borneo,\
  \ in the Clearwater Cave System. At 222km length, it prides itself on being the\
  \ eight longest cave system in the world, formed by millennia of rain patiently\
  \ eroding the limestone. Zoom out a bit more and you could see majestic karst formations\
  \ jutting out from the rainforest that is Mulu National Park. \nI had chosen to\
  \ go on a 5km expedition through the cave that would see me scrambling over huge\
  \ boulders and swimming through a crisp and clear underground river \u2013 an experience\
  \ that would leave me in incredible awe and with a scar on my knee from a particularly\
  \ treacherous limestone column. But I didn\u2019t know that yet. All I knew was\
  \ that I had to lower myself deep down into a fissure in the belly of the Malaysian\
  \ earth. \n\u201CMake sure to have a safe stance before every step, and nothing\
  \ can happen!\u201D The guide smiled his well-practiced encouraging smile. Three\
  \ of my fellow cavers were already at the bottom and they had evidently survived\
  \ \u2013 so what could go wrong? I knelt next to the edge and lowered one foot,\
  \ then the other, my heart beating wildly. As I heaved my body over the edge and\
  \ started descending, I found that there is a certain kind of magic in the mix of\
  \ adrenaline and concentration that an experience like this will inevitably bring\
  \ with it. Upon reaching the bottom, I realised with surprise that I had forgotten\
  \ to be afraid. I had not only pushed, but shoved my boundaries. The reward was\
  \ an expedition into a world that keeps secrets such as musical stalactites that\
  \ can be played like xylophones and thousand-year old seashells that formed the\
  \ tapestry of rugged walls in a time when I would have stood eye to eye with ancient\
  \ sea creatures in the spot where I was standing now.  \nAs far as I remember, my\
  \ claustrophobic nightmare never returned."
