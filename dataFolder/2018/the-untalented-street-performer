Text: "I knew the night before that, when I woke up, I wouldn\u2019t want to leave.\
  \ I\u2019d talked about it for a year, but the time had really come. As the uninvited\
  \ sun filled the room with its piercing rays and my eyes opened themselves, I found\
  \ myself paralyzed in my bed. Back to sleep I went.\nFalmouth in South-West England\
  \ is where I blossomed from an anxiety sufferer to the man I am now. I have so many\
  \ golden memories from that small seaside town that I\u2019d struggled for a long\
  \ time to leave it behind; those University years were the happiest I\u2019d ever\
  \ had, but they were over. To move on, I chose to leave from there on my solo hitchhiking\
  \ adventure around the world; I would leave the old life to begin my new one as\
  \ a Travel Writer and Adventurer.\nNever have I procrastinated as much as I did\
  \ on that day. Finally, at 3pm, Jack, my last remaining friend there, and I walked\
  \ out of his front door to the town center. This was the last time I\u2019d see\
  \ the place as it knew it. My throat knotted, and my legs stiffened. No quicker\
  \ than we had to, we walked to the road going East. We took, what we thought was,\
  \ a shortcut. When I pictured myself on the first day of a big, brave, life-changing\
  \ adventure, I never imagined getting lost.\nWith my self-confidence knocked, it\
  \ was time for Jack to leave me. When he disappeared around the corner, the magnitude\
  \ of what I was attempting hit me like a stampede. I began to feel sick, but that\
  \ could have been the hangover from the night before. \n\u2018Who does this kind\
  \ of trip?\u2019 I thought to myself. \u2018Only those explorers you see on TV.\
  \ I\u2019m not one of them! Behind me is safety. I can\u2019t make it around the\
  \ world alone!\u2019\nI couldn\u2019t bring myself to put my thumb out; people stared\
  \ as they rushed past in their cars. I felt like an untalented street performer.\
  \ I couldn\u2019t go forward, and I didn\u2019t want to go back, so I sat down and\
  \ broke out some biscuits.\nI looked at the whole route on my phone. This was the\
  \ mistake I was making; nobody climbs a mountain in one big step. I zoomed in to\
  \ the UK section and told myself to focus on that part for now. And with that, I\
  \ felt just about able to carry on. I finally saw what was ahead of me with complete\
  \ clarity: a mammoth, but achievable, challenge. \nLike a depressed person struggling\
  \ to get out of bed, I avoided putting my thumb out for as long as possible. I walked\
  \ until there was no pavement, then I disconnected my mind from my body and watched\
  \ my thumb go up. I got picked up right away. I was on my way!"
