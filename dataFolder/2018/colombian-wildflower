Text: "After spending 8 exhilarating days in the Amazonas region of Colombia, I was\
  \ decided on heading up to the sunny beaches of the Caribbean coast. The idea of\
  \ doing my scuba certification gave me a sense of being productive, whilst also\
  \ relaxing by the sea. With that in mind, I booked my flight to Santa Marta. \n\n\
  Santa Marta is the gateway for many tourists who want to access the picturesque\
  \ Tayrona National Park or who, like me, want to get their open water certification\
  \ in the small village just outside of Santa Marta: Taganga. \n\nThe next morning,\
  \ I set out to meet my dive instructor, Reto Muller. After all the details were\
  \ hammered out, he invited me to join him and other student's of his for dinner\
  \ at the local hotspot Babaganoush. \n\nThat night is when I met her. Strolling\
  \ in with a flower in her hair and a smile that lit up the whole room. \n\"This\
  \ is my friend Cindy, she will be doing her certification with you this week.\"\
  \ \nI could hardly take my eyes off of her and when she spoke with her Spanish accent,\
  \ I knew I was done for. \n\nTravel romance is a tricky thing, it happens when you\
  \ least expect it and for the most part, you know full well you are embarking on\
  \ an emotional journey that has little to no chance of lasting. Yet, getting lost\
  \ in the moment is a liberating thing to do, and it is exactly what we ended up\
  \ doing. \nSpending the week together as scuba \"buddies\", Cindy and I spent our\
  \ days scuba diving; our nights having drinks on the beach, watching sunsets while\
  \ smoking joints and getting lost in each other's eyes. \n\nOnce the scuba certification\
  \ was over, I booked an extra 3 days stay at a hotel in Santa Marta, where Cindy\
  \ showed me around her city. \n\"Do you want to go to the best place to smoke a\
  \ joint ever?\"  My answer was clearly yes. \n\nThere I was, on the back of a motorcycle\
  \ taxi, following this firecracker of a woman up the rain swept and mud covered\
  \ trails leading up the mountains outside of Minca. Higher and higher we went. The\
  \ whole time, my eyes on her, lost in the moment, making a memory that would last\
  \ me a lifetime. Our destination, a hostel at the very top of the mountain, high\
  \ up in the clouds with the view of Santa Marta and the Caribbean sea in the distance.\
  \ It was at that moment that I realized that leaving this place would be bittersweet\
  \ and that the longer I stayed the harder it would be.\n\nI said my goodbyes to\
  \ Cindy two days later, with a heavy heart but knowing that this, like most travel\
  \ romances, could never last."
