Text: "We always heard that love come when less you are expecting it, well this is\
  \ a true love story, short but unexpected.\nA couple years ago while I was studying\
  \ in Barcelona, Coldplay announced their concert in the next summer, my entire class\
  \ bought tickets for the concert, but my friend and I can\u2019t buy the same location\
  \ of the rest of the group, so we have to buy another location. \n\nOne week before\
  \ to the concert, my friend decided to sell her ticket without telling me anything\
  \ until the concert day. Upset as never before in my life, I decided to go to the\
  \ concert alone, never expecting to have a good concert or meet some nice guy there.\
  \ \n\nThe day of the concert, a guy who I didn't know but with who I had been talking\
  \ a couple weeks ago through a Facebook group, write me asking about my location\
  \ in the concert, I told him my story and when we confirmed that we had the same\
  \ location he invited me to go with them, really upset about my situation and not\
  \ having any better option I accepted go with them.\n\nColdplay in Barcelona was\
  \ one of the best concerts in my life, this guy and his friends made me feel like\
  \ if I had been part of their group since always. The next days to the concert I\
  \ was dating with this amazing guy: a passionate guy who lives every day smiling,\
  \ his energy fill my heart every moment in an unexpected way, everything between\
  \ us was magic and made me feel like that was my place, maybe because our relationship\
  \ was short, or maybe because we were really soulmates.\nWe were together a couple\
  \ months, the time during both of us were living in Barcelona, we knew that one\
  \ day each one will have to go back to their country, far from each other, he went\
  \ first, we tried to keep our relationship through the distance, but it was hard,\
  \ a couple months after his depart I came back to my country, that was 2 years ago.\n\
  Now we are good friends, we don\u2019t know much about our lives, but sometimes\
  \ we talk each other just to know if everything is going fine in our lives, we never\
  \ ask about details, is not important if he has someone else or not in his life,\
  \ is just good to know that everything is all right for us. I remember him as the\
  \ best part of my short time living in Spain, and about my friend, we don\u2019\
  t talk a lot now, but one day I thanked her for left me alone that day because in\
  \ that unexpected day I met one of the most important person in my life."
