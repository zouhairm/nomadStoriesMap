Text: "\u201CBreathe in\u2026breathe out\u2026\u201D I thought to myself as the thinning\
  \ crisp air filled my lungs.\n\u201CSix hundred fifty-three, fifty-four, fifty-five\u2026\
  \u201D I whispered to myself as I counted each step while climbing to take my mind\
  \ off the immense altitude. The circling lactic acid burned in my thighs. \u201C\
  Don\u2019t look back,\u201D I instructed myself, because looking down was far scarier\
  \ than looking up. \nSix hundred seventy-four steps above the earth and I finally\
  \ made it. After I told myself, \u201CDon\u2019t look back\u201D, I looked anyway\
  \ to find Aline clinging to the handrail for dear life, attempting to overcome her\
  \ acrophobia.\n\u201COnly a few more steps!\u201D I encouraged her.\nI looked across\
  \ the platform to the hundreds of people of so many cultures and languages standing\
  \ before me. As I journeyed over to the edge of the platform, my breath escaped\
  \ me, not from oxygen deprivation due to climbing stairs this time, but from the\
  \ breathtaking view of the City of Light.\nAs I stood on the second platform of\
  \ the Eiffel Tower, I began reminiscing about my two weeks spent in the historical\
  \ and architecturally striking France. Three months ago, I first emailed Aline,\
  \ but we finally met only two weeks ago. She and her family welcomed me into their\
  \ home as a native English speaker, a high school Spanish student, and a French\
  \ novice.\n\u201CComment avez-vous dormi?\u201D Aline\u2019s mother asked me how\
  \ I slept each morning.\n\u201CBien!\u201D I would reply as I started realizing\
  \ French is not too different from Spanish.\nDuring these two weeks, I was able\
  \ to immerse myself in the French culture and engage in activities I never thought\
  \ I\u2019d have the chance to do: dining on escargot, biking through Paris, unconsciously\
  \ developing a slight French accent, even forgetting that they use the metric system\
  \ and seeing Aline\u2019s father express serious concern when I said temperatures\
  \ were reaching the 90\u2019s back home. These are all moments that I would cherish\
  \ for the rest of my life.\nThe years spent peering at Paris through the screen\
  \ of my computer did not compare to the sight I was staring at now. Here I stand\
  \ next to my new friend Aline who I would have never met if I said no to the opportunity\
  \ of being a foreign exchange student. A moment of melancholy swept over me as I\
  \ thought about saying \u201CAu revoir\u201D to Aline and her parents tomorrow.\
  \ For now, though, I say \u201CBonjour\u201D, because that is what it is, a good\
  \ day. I dismiss the thought of leaving and focus my attention on the river boats\
  \ traveling along the glistening waters of the Seine."
