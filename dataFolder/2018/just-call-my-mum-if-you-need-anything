Text: "\u201CYou\u2019re cyclists?\u201D he asked confidently. We looked at each other,\
  \ puzzled for a moment as to how he knew the three of us, dressed in denim shorts\
  \ and tees, no bikes in sight, had just spent six days on the saddle. \nHe read\
  \ the confused looks and quickly backed up the semi-statement/question with another.\
  \ \u201CThe tan lines above your knees, from lycras?\u201D We laughed and smiled\
  \ at each other with an evident air of pride given our recent achievement. \u201C\
  Ahaa, good spot\u201D I replied.\n\nThe busy terrace was filling up in the late\
  \ afternoon sunshine as we sat back, Aperol Spritzes safely within reach. We\u2019\
  d asked to join his table and had excitedly begun recounting our seven hundred kilometre\
  \ journey south along the hilly coastline. It turned out that cycling was his thing\
  \ too as he empathised with our arduous sense of joy.\n\nMarco had adopted a life\
  \ in Dubrovnik several hundred kilometres from his hometown of \u0160ibenik. A nice\
  \ synchronicity I thought as I described the next leg of our journey that would\
  \ launch from there\u2026 a thirty five kilometre swim around the turquoise archipelago.\
  \ \n\n\u201CAmazing, well, just call my Mum if you need anything!\u201D he said.\
  \ I noted his genuine tone. The bag I\u2019d anxiously packed earlier, was sitting\
  \ in the room of my apartment. It couldn\u2019t come with us to sea. The four metre\
  \ paddle board that had flown in with Ryan, was intended for transporting food,\
  \ water and camping kit only. \n\nWe\u2019d parted ways, exchanging details before\
  \ trotting off to collect final supplies. The five hour journey the following day\
  \ took us back up the coast towards \u0160ibenik. I was nervous. \u201CCan you message\
  \ Marco and get his Mum\u2019s number?\u201D, I said to Rose as I passed over my\
  \ phone, one hand on the wheel and my head in thought. I\u2019d explained our fortuitous\
  \ meet yesterday and was confident that this was the best option for a 3 day bag\
  \ drop. As random as it seemed, it felt less so. From experience these \u2018coincidences\u2019\
  \ often happen when in need of a helping hand and travelling with an open heart.\n\
  \nAnd that is how I came to meet Olga, laiden with backpack and as fast as leaden\
  \ legs would wind through cobbled streets. I arrived at her door to the warmest\
  \ of welcomes and returned the kindness with a cascade of thanks. As I handed over\
  \ my bag, I thought fondly of Marco and our relaxed conversation in the sunshine.\
  \ \n\nThe ferry was pulling into port as Ryan and Rose waited patiently for my return.\
  \ I gave them the thumbs up and jogged over, breathless but weight lifted from my\
  \ shoulders."
