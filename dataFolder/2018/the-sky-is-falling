Text: "Kootney Lake is flooding with ducks. Spilling over the shoreline as they, like\
  \ me, retire to their nests in the early evening light.  Passing down Baker street\
  \ with it\u2019s granite storefronts boasting bay windows of elaborate rainbow coloured\
  \ mouldings, it is hard to say whether or not Nelson is a mountain town. Whitewater\
  \ Ski Resort is a mere 25 minute drive away, but the steep tree covered hills which\
  \ make up the surrounding landscape are not synonymous with the vision of the sharp\
  \ rocky alpine peaks one might associate with the term \u2018mountain\u2019. No,\
  \ Nelson feels more like a lucky orchard where in winter residents can play on snowy\
  \ slopes among dormant plum trees; trees which at this moment, happen to be in full,\
  \ delicious bloom. This is not a place you are likely to pass through on your way\
  \ to somewhere else. Like any town that this is the case for, people come with the\
  \ clear intention of being here and this shapes the culture of the townscape. In\
  \ the late 60\u2019s the people who came were young American\u2019s escaping the\
  \ mandatory draft and a war they refused to fight. Now, it is often students and\
  \ travelers who come for a season.  \n\nMyself, I came to visit a friend. It is\
  \ quite the ascent to the house where I am staying and from the top of mountain\
  \ station road, the whole valley is visible. Early September is still mild as we\
  \ retire to the porch to enjoy the night and each other\u2019s company. There are\
  \ some days you will remember for a lifetime. Others, are just the experience of\
  \ time in between the ones you don\u2019t forget. Thing is, you rarely know which\
  \ days in your present you will remember as being your past until some point in\
  \ the future. When these memorable days find their place in the permanent plot of\
  \ your individual history, hopefully you can say you lived a day worthy of remembering.\
  \ This just happened to be one such day for me. I reflect gratefully on the memory\
  \ that I chose to spend this particular afternoon watching ducks at the lake.\n\n\
  It appears as a blue light not far above the adjacent tree line. A basketball sized\
  \ fireball growing in intensity and magnitude bounces across the sky in an arc before\
  \ disappearing behind a hill. A few seconds pass. Long seconds. Long seconds in\
  \ which I contemplate my mortality and question how well the life I lead aligns\
  \ with my deepest values. I think of those who live daily under the threat of war.\
  \ I think of the forest fires currently raging though the region. I think about\
  \ aliens. The ground tremors with the impact."
