Text: "Berlin was a train wreck. I woke up in a bed at the Western Grand on Friedrichstra\xDF\
  e . White sheets and a cold cutting air that should never have a place in the middle\
  \ of the European summer.  It was my hotel but it wasn\u2019t my room. I opened\
  \ the curtains and looked onto an empty courtyard. Grey stone. Green aisles. A perfectly\
  \ framed picture but strangely desolate. And I wondered if the universe was already\
  \ aware of what had been taken from me the night before. I took a picture of myself\
  \ on my phone. I'm not sure why. The pale light outside illuminated my face. I looked\
  \ pretty. It was a lie. I sat back onto the bed. I allowed myself to be encompassed\
  \ by the plush pillows and pageantry of the luxury that surrounded me and tried\
  \ to breathe. But white was never so dirty. And I told myself to try to rest my\
  \ restless mind but all could do was implore the universe to carry me along, as\
  \ it always had, as I knew it always would\u2026\n\nThe rain was solid when I finally\
  \ left. It perfectly replicated the confusion I felt. July in Germany wasn\u2019\
  t meant to be so cruel. The doorman tried to give me an umbrella. I lied and told\
  \ him I wasn't  a guest. Instead I headed towards the Tiergarten unprotected and\
  \ alone. Golden green gates. A lush plush village of plumage and leaves. The water\
  \ shattered off the canopies and splattered my face as I navigated the trails deeper\
  \ and deeper into its winding heart. I was enveloped by a fresh clean scent. It\
  \ stung like whipping rubber against my face but I felt renewed. \n\nAs I returned\
  \ back to the hotel to gather my things I walked past Aktion T4. An address which\
  \ in allowed Nazi Germany the right to euthanize mentally ill patients who by their\
  \ standards were deemed \u2018unfit to live\u2019. Plaques ominously placed outside\
  \ the abandoned facility articulating the pain of those individuals who were not\
  \ only tormented by their minds but were then told that their pain made them unworthy\
  \ of life. And this one statement resonated with more than anything could on that\
  \ day of all days. It said \u2018Ich Vor meine Wenigkeit halthe demnag als das Menschliche\
  \ dasein in meir selpst auvergt\u2019. Which  roughly translates to this: \u2019\
  \ I am my humble self, therefore I will always uphold the human existence in me..\u2019"
