Text: "There we were, me and two friends, Maria and Francisco, inside a train between\
  \ Florence and Rome. We arrived at night. We had booked a camping site on the outskirts\
  \ of Rome, and all we knew was that we had to get a bus from a certain spot in the\
  \ city. But we had no idea where it was, and no one was able to tell us. So we just\
  \ wandered around Rome carrying our bags, on a really hot night. The ground was\
  \ so hot, that my bag\u2019s wheels almost catch fire - they literally melted. We\
  \ walked for hours, and again we saw a lot of the main attractions when we weren\u2019\
  t expecting. We finally made it to the bus stop, and we got on a bus. It should\
  \ be about 3 in the morning, we were so tired that we slept for the whole trip,\
  \ which took about an hour. Now for the next part of the story I can only tell what\
  \ I remember, because I was in a deep sleep and today I still don\u2019t understand\
  \ exactly what happened. I just know that Francisco woke me up, the bus was parked\
  \ and completely empty, in the middle of nowhere, and outside there was a car with\
  \ the lights on. Francisco told me the car was from the camping site and was there\
  \ to take us there. Okay, I believed him. But it wasn\u2019t. The bus driver didn\u2019\
  t speak English, and somehow my friend understood that the driver told him we should\
  \ get in that car to get to the camping site. So\u2026 we got in the car, and it\
  \ took off. Only a few minutes later we really started to wake up and we realised\
  \ the car wasn\u2019t from the camping, it was just a man who was passing by, and\
  \ offered to take us there. I don\u2019t really know how this all begun. We were\
  \ really scared for a while, but happily he really took us there! And he turned\
  \ out to be a very nice person, although a strange and mysterious man. We thanked\
  \ him and went to the reception to check in. As he was about to drive away, he stopped\
  \ again and rolled the window down, to say goodbye. At that very moment, I put my\
  \ hand in my pocket and I couldn\u2019t find my phone. It had fallen on the car\
  \ seat, and as incredibly as it may seem, the man stopped there at the right moment\
  \ I realised this. I immediately went for the car and there was the phone. That\
  \ was incredible lucky, and at the same time it was really strange. This man seemed\
  \ to appear every time we needed, like some kind of \u201Cgod\u201D, as we called\
  \ him as a private joke. It was a very strange night, and we were so tired we still\
  \ don\u2019t understand it. Truth be told, it feels more like a dream!"
