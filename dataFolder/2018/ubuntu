Text: "I felt something on my shoulder awaking me. Pulling up my mask, I looked hastily\
  \ around. As the stewardess asked, I diligently raised the porthole. Sudden light,\
  \ after hours of darkness, blinded me. Slowly my eyes opened, and I first laid sight\
  \ on the top of a wide mountaintop. Its hills were sharply falling into the ocean.\
  \ The blue was so vast in the fresh crisp morning air, the sun, rising, was starting\
  \ to stretch like roots over lowland. The ocean\u2019s surface was shimmering, inviting\
  \ like a millions joyful smiles. Nested in what drew like extended arms: a city,\
  \ looking so small it the majesty of it all. \n\nHello Cape Town.\n\nThe air was\
  \ warm. I noticed the mist, faraway: water slowly evaporating in the African sun.\
  \ As I came in the car rental shop, I saw a young lady. She had left when I came\
  \ out. The mist was, too,  gone: everything around me appeared less dreamy. I started\
  \ walking to my car, when I heard a voice. A woman voice, sobbing. \n\nI looked\
  \ around. I didn\u2019t understand the language. Nothing I had ever heard. They\
  \ were strange sounds, with clicks. Walking faster, I found her in the deserted\
  \ parking. As soon as she saw me, she stood up, trying to dry her tears. \n\n\u201C\
  Are you okay?\u201D. She was young, twenty at most. I smiled at her, trying to ease\
  \ her pain. She nodded, and a shy sad smile came over her face. More tears rolled\
  \ down as she lowered her head again, avoiding my gaze.\n\nShe didn\u2019t budge\
  \ as I was stuffing my luggage in the trunk. \u201CDo you need a ride?\u201D. She\
  \ looked at me: she didn\u2019t understand. Clasping my hands around an invisible\
  \ wheel, I pointed at the exit.\n\nSuddenly, as we were in the middle of the highway,\
  \ she screamed: \u201CSTOP!\u201D. I looked at her. \u201CSTOP!\u201D She repeated.\
  \ \u201CHere?\u201D. We were in the middle of the artery, cars passing by. I pulled\
  \ over.\n\nShe looked at me intensively, and jolted: \u201CUbuntu!\u201D. As she\
  \ was running away, I noticed a moving assembly, which came to a halt as she arrived.\
  \ She bended over to kiss a black case six men carried. Then, swallowed by some\
  \ familiar arms, the procession started again, until disappearing. A coffin.\n\n\
  \u201CAre you okay?\u201D, two men asked. \u201CIt\u2019s very dangerous around\
  \ here! You shouldn\u2019t stay by the road\u2026 It\u2019s Khayelitsha, miss\u2026\
  \ our biggest township. It\u2019s very dangerous!\u201D I realized as the sunlight\
  \ dimmed that I must have stayed a long time, absorbed in thoughts.  \n\nYou never\
  \ know which travels will change your life. But that day, during my first hours\
  \ in South Africa, I got reminded of the forgotten word \u201CUbuntu\u201D."
