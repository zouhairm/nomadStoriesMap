Text: "This story is not about how I stayed, in three different houses of local people\
  \ during 8 days without paying.This story is not about how in the third house that\
  \ I stayed, I did not get to know the owner. He was traveling but he left me the\
  \ keys to his house. (Back then Aibnb didn't exist).This story is not about how\
  \ my last night in Istanbul, I ended up dancing salsa in the middle of a class in\
  \ front of 50 people, just 3 hours before leaving to the airport.This story is not\
  \ about how while taking pictures at the entrance of a mosque, a woman in her burka\
  \ winked at me (I had a feeling of surprise, laughter, and fright).This story is\
  \ not about me eating the most incredible durum made with a filling of 21 spices\
  \ and mint. (Spectacular and really spicy).This story is not about how I found in\
  \ the spice bazaar, a cheese very similar to my favorite cheese from my country\
  \ (Honduras). A cheese that I haven\u2019t found anywhere else: The \u201Cquesillo\u201C\
  .This story is not about how a guy waved at my camera while I was taking pictures\
  \ of the crowd. Apparently, people here, seem to like winking and waving to my camera.This\
  \ story is not about me enjoying for the first time balcan music in a rooftop with\
  \ a beautiful view of Istambul. All of this thanks to one of my host. The perks\
  \ of exploring a city with local people. \n\nAll of the above is material for another\
  \ story. Or maybe for 20 different stories.\n\nThis story is really about how after\
  \ 7 days, once visited every monument and touristic place, I decided to discover\
  \ some neighborhood of Istanbul. Far from the city, away from tourism to see other\
  \ realities.I started walking away from the markets in search of that neighborhood.\
  \ Suddenly I was being alone in the street. I started to see buildings made of wood.\
  \ Some houses almost falling, others abandoned. I had no idea where I was. You could\
  \ see the clothes hanging outside the houses, as you usually see in neighborhoods\
  \ in many cities. \n\nFinally, I started to see people again: I run into 3 children\
  \ and some girls who nicely approached me. I shoot pictures of them, we laugh. They\
  \ laugh when they see themselves on camera. We could not communicate in any language,\
  \ except in the language of sympathy and photography. I say goodbye to the children.Meanwhile,\
  \ I was talking to myself: \u201DThat\u2019s it, I\u2019ve seen what I wanted to\
  \ see.  With this and the rest of the past week, I\u2019ve lived what I wanted to\
  \ live on this trip\u201D."
