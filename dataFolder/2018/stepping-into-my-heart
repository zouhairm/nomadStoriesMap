Text: "That was the last tick-tock sound I could hear before the result, the result\
  \ which was going to tell how I will end up living my life.\nI want to write for\
  \ the world,for a purpose,for a cause,but I ended up writing those silly exam papers.\n\
  I wasn\u2019t forced for career in this field, it was my decision. But influencers\
  \ play a great role in decision making.After that,I didn\u2019t believe that I could\
  \ be an eminent writer.But I still believe that belief creates the actual fact.\
  \ But as circumstances fall, so does you. \nThe tick-tock didn\u2019t stop but my\
  \ enmity did.It announced that I have passed all my tests.But then being a deep\
  \ observer, my pupil dilated as it went to the \u201CTerms and Conditions\u201D\
  \ below.\u2018This result is solely put up to bunk your inflammation. The actual\
  \ result could vary in 1% of cases\u2019.\nHow can I not doubt myself? Of course,\
  \ the 1% case is me.Luckily, my belief failed and I felt good.\nEven after I got\
  \ the most sybaritic job, I didn\u2019t actually felt it.I knew I wanted something\
  \ deeper. But I didn\u2019t hold the belief.\nExactly after 12 nights and 13 days,\
  \ I was sitting in this room,quiet as a lamb,full of people and their chaos. In\
  \ such a haphazard room, I could hear my heart screaming,\u2018Fuck belief girl.Go\
  \ lead your passion'. I swear, I never felt my heart so arrogant at me before.I\
  \ stood up and walked out, out of my heart\nWith a $200 note in my pocket, I went\
  \ to break the taboo\nWriting and travelling were the sole purposes of my life.It\
  \ was the time, I just had to sit quiet, so that the process going on my mind does\
  \ shake hands with my imagination.I had to accomplish my dreams and never stop until\
  \ done\nI bathed to the Adalaj Stepwell, a historical landmark in the rural streets\
  \ of Gujarat, India. The wind finding space between my hair and the grass waiving\
  \ a \u201Cwelcome to your world\u201D greet, I sat down on a flat carnation taking\
  \ the support of the pillar on my back, with a book and a pen\nI touched the marvel\
  \ and felt the intricated incarnations. I felt the motifs of flowers and graphics\
  \ of a community blend very well with the symbols of another carved at various levels\
  \ of the well. I felt those muscles of smiling humans passing by. The octagonal\
  \ opening at the top instantly left my eyes opened. I felt the little rooms there\
  \ with oriel windows decorated with minutely carved brackets at four corners. I\
  \ felt the pride of the King who would have reigned this territory\nI took no time\
  \ to jot it down in my book.Yes, I am a writer, a follower of my passion."
