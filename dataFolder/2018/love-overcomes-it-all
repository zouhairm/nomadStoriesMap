Text: "I\xB4m sitting in the airplane. Thinking about the passed weeks. I\xB4ve never\
  \ thought it would be like that. I\xB4ve never thought I would meet him. And I\xB4\
  ve never thought that the first real love of my life would live 3.198,73 km away.\n\
  What about David? He is a class mate of me. And I always guessed I love him. His\
  \ blonde hair and the blue eyes. A german guy. A german potato.  I\xB4m in love\
  \ with my host brother. I imagined his lovingly view on me, his perfect skin, his\
  \ beautiful black hair.\nAnd the only time we touched. The hugh when he said goodbye.\
  \ Maybe for ever.\nI feel like starting to cry. The airplane i rolling on the runway,\
  \ moving faster, getting up into the sky. A last view on the israelian landscape.\
  \ I will miss you Raheeb. I will miss your soft voice while speeking to me. And\
  \ I will come back to visit you.\nI want to eat falaffels with you again. Want to\
  \ learn simple arabican words from you. \nTeach me how to say \"I love you\" in\
  \ your language! And please say it to me! \nA few weeks ago, it has not been possible\
  \ for me. That I fall in love with a guy fom another culture. That I fall in love\
  \ with a guy who is not speaking the same language as me. Falling in love with a\
  \ guy who is not german was not possible.\nI\xB4m not rassist. But I\xB4ve never\
  \ been away from home. So my view was so narrowed. Now so many things have a belonging.\
  \ The food out there in Israel. The religion. Israel an his people changed my life.\
  \ Not only my love for Raheeb. But they all are so differend that germans. They\
  \ are always in delay. The life out there is so much simpler. They are open minded\
  \ and absolutely warm hearted. Form y life which I will continue in Germany, I will\
  \ try to be like them. Try to be more thankful at all. \nBecause not everything\
  \ in their country is like paradise. There are guns everywhere. I didn\xB4t see\
  \ anyone using the gun but the military is everywhere: \u201EThere are here for\
  \ your safety\u201C, my hostdad always said when he saw my scared face. But that\
  \ was only in the beginning. After some time I was used tot he picture of military\
  \ and guns.  In one oft he Workshops I had for preparation, the teachers told me\
  \ about that. About the political situation out there. Sometimes I was afraid. I\
  \ was not sure if I shoukd start the adventure or not. But now I\xB4m glad I did.\
  \ I got so many impressions. I learned so much. And I want to learn so much more.\n\
