Text: "From my hostel to Doolin Harbor, I stop to pet every dappled grey mare, each\
  \ one gentle and obliging. It\u2019s overcast with a fierce wind but, for once,\
  \ not raining. I\u2019m 478 miles into a 1,000-mile solo bicycle trek up Ireland\u2019\
  s rugged, often unforgiving, Wild Atlantic Way. Today\u2014a rest day\u2014I\u2019\
  m visiting the Aran Islands off the coast of Galway.\n\nThe sea churns, banging\
  \ our small ferryboat into others. I\u2019m seasick before the gangplank is released\
  \ from the dock. Six-foot waves bob us up and down. Eyes on the horizon, white knuckled\
  \ grip on my seat. Could I save myself if we capsized? Passengers scream as the\
  \ sea crashes over the front of our boat, then groan in unison as we slide down\
  \ the backside of each wave. My glasses are smeared with salt from the unrelenting\
  \ spray. Inisheer is getting closer.\n\nA tiny island harbor acts as entrance to\
  \ an old world with horse drawn carriages and dogs running underfoot. Tourists hire\
  \ carriage drivers but I\u2019m happy to walk. An intricate pattern of rock walls\
  \ emerges, twisting to create animal paddocks and pathways to cottages on the hill.\
  \ Steadfast. Sturdy. They\u2019ve endured harsh weather for centuries. Clouds part\
  \ to reveal a perfect summer day. Ponies trot quickly by. I\u2019m in a fairytale,\
  \ quite conscious of the difference between stories we read and experiences we have.\n\
  \nOn the far side of the island is the Plassy shipwreck, a trawler run aground and\
  \ rusted through. Children play fiddles for tips at the site. A local with one eye\
  \ stuck in a permanent squint rolls a cigarette as we chat. \u201CTake this road\
  \ to the lighthouse, cross over the rocks, then look for the path to the castle.\u201D\
  \ This is exactly what I do.\n\nOut past the shipwreck seagulls cackle on the beach.\
  \ Sea pink thrift flowers blanket each side of the path as I meander towards an\
  \ unexpected scene\u2014a birthing calf. The mother is on her side; the baby\u2019\
  s feet are out. Like a bovine midwife, an old farmer in a tweed flat cap gently\
  \ pulls as the mama pushes. Entranced, I rest my forearms and chin on the top of\
  \ the rock wall. Stories vs. experiences.\n\nWith the sun out, the water in the\
  \ harbor turns aquamarine. Young boys jump from the sea wall towering 15\u2019 above\
  \ the surface. The boat for our return is powerful, surging into waves at high speed.\
  \ Kids rush to the sides to be splashed and squeal in delight. Back in Doolin, captains\
  \ zip the ferries around like cars, parallel parking them along the dock. I check\
  \ back in with the mares. Gratitude for my day on Inisheer consumes me."
