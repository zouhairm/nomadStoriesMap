Text: '''Travel'' That small word is enough to change your sorrow into joy. I personally
  don''t think there would be anyone on this earth who would not like to travel. Well
  if talk about me, I am crazy about it. I am always ready to fly. The last place
  I travel was Himachal Pradesh in India. It was a 4 days short trip. I was accompanied
  with 12 more travellers. We visited around Dharamshala, Triund and Dalhousie. We
  visited lot of places and enjoyed a lot. Specially Dharamshala has been one of my
  favourite place to live in. It is a hill station with beautiful natural scenery
  and Beautiful GIRLS for sure. The most interesting thing I remember is the girl
  I met there in Dharamshala. It was 6 o clock in the morning.  I went to the roof
  of the hotel where I was staying in. I saw an girl practicing Yoga there. She was
  wearing white outfits and obviously she was beautiful. Now it was being hard for
  me to hold myself back without talking her in the mean while I was not willing to
  disturb her. I just kept looking at her. She kept doing her work and then left.
  I couldn''t say her anything due to lack of my confidence. I still get regret for
  same. All I wanted to tell her that she was looking beautiful that day. Now if I
  will win a travel writing trip to Argentina. I will be able to gain my confidence.
  Then i will see that girl again and tell her that She was looking DAMN AWESOME THAT
  DAY.'
