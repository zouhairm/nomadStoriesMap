Text: "In 2007,  we agreed to enter into a cultural exchange.  An exploration of rural\
  \ and urban and an exchange between people of Mongolia and the States. I was to\
  \ lead a group of Navajo students through a cultural exchange with people from Mongolia.\n\
  \nWe arrive in June, frost still covered the stark landscape around us as we were\
  \ escorted out into the desolate airport parking lot.  Mongolia was silent.  I breathed\
  \ in the crisp night air and looked up into the constellations yearning for some\
  \ familiarity from home.  The next two weeks would take us from the capital city\
  \ to isolated camel camps far out into the Gobi dessert.  We explored the canyon\
  \ lands were wild horses and two humped camels roamed.  We slept in the homes of\
  \ host families, sipped milk tea, ate mutton dumplings and homemade yogurt.\n\n\
  Far out in the Gobi we were welcomed into the home of a herder.  He worried about\
  \ the drought and questioned his daughter about the conditions of the lands to the\
  \ South. It had not rained and the sparse grasses would not sustain their camel\
  \ heard much longer. Bimba\u2019s father greeted us passing around his agate snuff\
  \ bottle of amaranth scented tobacco. Each person was expected to spoon out a pinch\
  \ or sniff the top of the container. \n\n The men within the household continued\
  \ their greetings.  Our host poured homemade camel milk vodka that smelled like\
  \ pickle brine.  He dipped his finger ring into the substance and flicked it into\
  \ the air as a blessing before presenting it  to his guests.  We ate dried jerked\
  \ camel meat soup and sucked on curd.\n\nMy husband who was also a herder, understood\
  \ the concerns of our host.  Together they talked about the impact of climate change\
  \ and wondered how much longer would they be able to maintain a pastoral lifestyle.\
  \ We spoke of the future, wanting the best for our children. Education was a vehicle\
  \ for change that assured a future for our youth but one that often weaned them\
  \ away from the earth and our traditions.\n\nUpon leaving my husband handed our\
  \ host his favorite pocket knife and left him with a turquoise horse fetish we had\
  \ brought from home.  Together we prayed for rain.  Each in his own way continue\
  \ to make offerings to the sky and earth. We wish for the abundance of grasses and\
  \ healthy herds that will take us into the future. As indigenous people, we wonder\
  \ however if we are the last of our kind.  Both Navajos and Mongolians cling fiercely\
  \ to their traditions as pastoral people but, watch intently at the skies that no\
  \ longer fill with rain."
