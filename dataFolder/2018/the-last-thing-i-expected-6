Text: "It was one of my first solo travelling trips. I was so excited about going\
  \ to Costa Rica! In just over two weeks, I was planning to visit as many locations\
  \ as possible, and to experience every imaginable aspect of the country, so I jumped\
  \ from one adventure to another, zip lining, horse riding and scuba diving.\n\n\
  The people I met on the way were always offering me good tips about where to go\
  \ next. I kept hearing that Puerto Viejo de Talamanca wasn\u2019t a place to miss.\
  \ It had never been in my plans to visit the town, but I decided to abandon my original\
  \ plan and go with the recommendations.\n\nArriving to Puerto Viejo was a shock.\
  \ The first thing I saw was a couple of small huts in the middle of the jungle with\
  \ nothing else in sight. The place was just this boring little village in the middle\
  \ of nowhere. The skies were grey.\n\nI felt stuck. I still had almost a week left\
  \ of my holiday, but this town was way out from every other point of interest. My\
  \ disappointment got worse by having been told that diving on this coast wouldn\u2019\
  t be possible due to bad visibility. I also learned that surfing would be way too\
  \ extreme for a beginner like me.\n\nI spent my first day in town walking around\
  \ in search of something, anything, interesting to do. The conclusion was that the\
  \ thing to do in this town was to rent a bicycle to ride around, so that\u2019s\
  \ what I did.\n\nI cycled the dusty streets of the town until I had seen it all.\
  \ It didn\u2019t take very long, as the place was tiny. Many of the buildings had\
  \ curious, quirky wall paintings, and the locals were friendly and curious everywhere\
  \ I went. I found to my surprise that I was quite enjoying the cycling. I wasn\u2019\
  t in a hurry to go anywhere, which forced me to slow my pace down a bit.\n\nWherever\
  \ I went in the upcoming few days, I always ran into someone I knew. More often\
  \ than not, that lead to us continuing the way together. Some days, I found myself\
  \ in a group of ten to twenty travellers roaming the streets. The casual friendliness\
  \ of the local people didn\u2019t stop at friendly greetings either. I even got\
  \ invited to a local barbecue where I was the only foreigner present.\n\nFor the\
  \ first time, I stopped worrying about where to go and what to do next. Instead,\
  \ I was living in the moment and taking it all in and enjoying myself.\n\nUpon arriving\
  \ to Puerto Viejo, I had never foreseen that when the time would come to leave,\
  \ I would loathe to do so. It really was the last thing I had expected, to fall\
  \ in love with this quiet little town and its people."
