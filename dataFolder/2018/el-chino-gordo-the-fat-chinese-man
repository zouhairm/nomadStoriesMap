Text: "I'm not Chinese or typically described as fat. My mom is Korean (South, if\
  \ you must know) and my dad is from the United States. I don't think I particularly\
  \ look Asian, but in white-washed rural Upstate New York I would experience the\
  \ occasional \"Chinese\" comment or remark. I know now it was just ignorance, but\
  \ at the time, I was offended and confused.\n\nA short while after leaving New York\
  \ I lived in Peru for just about two years, my experiences encompassing both the\
  \ rich suburbs and shack-filled hills of Lima to the deserts of Ica and the mountains\
  \ of Ayacucho. My Spanish was near non-existent upon my arrival so I didn't quite\
  \ understand everything that was going on around me. However, it wasn't too hard\
  \ to pick up on the words \"chino\" and \"gordo\", which straight translated mean\
  \ \"Chinese\" and \"fat\", respectively. \n\nHuman nature isn't the easiest to understand.\
  \ Was I being verbally attacked? This was a new country, language, and world to\
  \ me. Perhaps there is some misunderstanding here. But no, for most of my stay I\
  \ was called \"chino\" and on many occasions there would be a \"gordo\" remark.\
  \ \n\nInitially, my reaction was that of my younger self, to get defensive, sometimes\
  \ even offended, but mainly just confused. \"Soy coreano\" (I'm Korean) would be\
  \ my response, although technically I'm half-Korean, but that wasn't really the\
  \ point I was trying to make. Most of the time I was met with smiles and nods, as\
  \ if I was fooling myself about my own ethnicity. My response to not being fat was\
  \ met with similar, perhaps worse, reactions--normally incredulous looks and sometimes\
  \ a laugh or two.\n\nThe longer I lived in Peru the more I started to realize I\
  \ wasn't fully grasping the meaning of the words I thought were being rudely flung\
  \ my way. However, I soon realized Peruvians aren't rude people. Sarcasm isn't a\
  \ big thing in Spanish, or at least not in Peru. Peruvians are actually extremely\
  \ nice, humble, and charitable. My visiting family and I were once treated to the\
  \ exquisite delicacy of cuy (guinea pig) by a Peruvian man and his family in their\
  \ tiny and dark cinder-block house. It was well beyond the type of meal they would\
  \ normally partake of and, yet, here they were sharing it with us.\n\nI came to\
  \ find out that \"chino\" and \"gordo\", among their normal uses, were very common\
  \ nicknames given to certain members of most groups of Peruvian friends. It's a\
  \ sign of belonging and mutual understanding. I was, and still am, Chino, and sometimes\
  \ Gordo, to my Peruvian family."
