Text: "It was the last thing that I expected.\nAs I got off the raggedy old boat,\
  \ slowly I started making sense of my surroundings.  My eyes were opened to a whole\
  \ new  world. The silence said it all, I was now being ushered into a new dimension\
  \ i had never experienced. I could not help but notice that the air had changed.\
  \ The beauty of the environment just took my breath away. I never imagined neither\
  \ could I comprehend such beauty would be found in such a remote in accessible location.\
  \ \nGrowing up in dusty streets of Gweru Zimbabwe I would never have imagined there\
  \ was another world out there. Travelling to and from our village home stead was\
  \ all we had ever known. Aeroplanes were machines we could only hear pass over us\
  \ and we would run into the streets shouting with excitement.\nMy only connection\
  \ with the outside world came from relatives from the big city, who would bring\
  \ us sweets and our world would be filled with joy. Little did I know that there\
  \ was a whole different world out there filled with fun and adventure lack of exposure\
  \ was our biggest vice.\n Our destination of choice for the festive holidays was\
  \ Mozambique. Being a first time traveller to the Sothern African country as a precautionary\
  \ measure we got had started on a malaria prevention treatment 3 weeks prior to\
  \ our travel. The excited of the visit overshadowed all the fears. Driving to Beira\
  \ was a phantom task. Tired and exhausted, we arrived at our hotel. \n  Waking up\
  \ at the crack of dawn to an exceptionally hot morning we ventured out. Little did\
  \ I know that it was going to be a journey that would open my eyes to a new world.\n\
  As went one could not help but notice the swamps of water and men riding in single\
  \ file on bicycles carrying huge two or three bags of charcoal and struggling to\
  \ maintain their balance. In what seemed to be a life time we finally arrived.\n\
  As we arrived we were informed that we had to take a boat to get to our destination,\
  \ hunger and frustration was now getting the best of me. I got into the small boat\
  \ which ferried both goods and people. Moving at a snail pace the boat negotiated\
  \ its way across the river. As we got closer to the beach I felt a cool breeze .I\
  \ could not help but notice the immaculate white sandy beaches. The clear blue skies\
  \ and the view just took my breath away .Blown away by the beauty.  All the turmoil\
  \ and the irritation that we endured on our way were all wiped away. Finally we\
  \ arrived at Rio Savane a small beach tucked away in the north eastern area of Beira."
