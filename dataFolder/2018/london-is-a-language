Text: "London is a language. I suppose most places are.\nLondon is one of the ones\
  \ with diverging accents, dialects, and colloquialisms, all from the same origin\
  \ but each unique. Truthfully, London is hundreds of languages.\nWhen you live in\
  \ London for close on a year, as I had, you\u2019re nowhere near fluent. But you\
  \ can begin to feel the language, to understand its essence, and to not only survive\
  \ it, but to string together something unique, as one learning a new language can\
  \ begin to speak beyond mere basics, if not yet eloquence.\nAs I led my mother across\
  \ the platform and onto the Piccadilly Line for her first visit to London, I knew\
  \ what she was noticing: the firm voice on the intercom advising her to watch the\
  \ gap. Her ears would perk up the first time the voice mentioned the final Piccadilly\
  \ stop at \u2018Cockfosters\u2019. She would only know to keep to the right on the\
  \ escalator as we transferred to the Circle Line once I prompted her. Once we emerged\
  \ into the pale sunlight at Westminster, I knew her eyes would go right to Big Ben.\
  \ Later as we walked along the glittering South Bank, she would notice Tower Bridge\
  \ stark against the horizon and Shakespeare\u2019s Globe nestled beside the Thames.\
  \ \nThese are the first vocabulary words you learn for London. These are \u2018\
  Hello\u2019 and \u2018Water\u2019 and \u2018Train\u2019. But in the London lexicon,\
  \ there is so much more. There are subtler, more uniquely beautiful journeys to\
  \ discover. Dennis Seaver\u2019s House--Mellifluous. Leather Lane Street Market--\
  \ Pastiche. Meath Gardens-- Evanescent. \n The lilting, labyrinthine roads alleys\
  \ that make up the London nervous system contain secret adventures nestled down\
  \ each path. I wanted to take my mom to see everything she\u2019d read about in\
  \ guide books. But I also hoped that she\u2019d let me show her my London. To show\
  \ her that the London Review Bookshop had the most delicious pistachio cake. To\
  \ introduce her to Markos, the tiny Greek man who worked at my favorite coffee house\
  \ and always had a joke for me. To show her that the best view of the skyline wasn\u2019\
  t in the London Eye but was actually from the top of the Sky Garden.\nWe all speak\
  \ differently and mastering any language takes years. But words bring us closer\
  \ to people we love and to people we haven\u2019t yet met. Sharing London with my\
  \ mother; showing her what made it my London and discovering what made it hers,\
  \ wouldn\u2019t be something any guidebook could give us. We could only discover\
  \ our own London by walking the city. By learning it. And by beginning to speak\
  \ it."
