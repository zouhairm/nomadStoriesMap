Text: "Have been 5 years since I was in Aparecida do Norte for the last time. Since\
  \ my grandmother died. It was her favorite place to visit, every year she was there\
  \ to pray for her health and for the lives of all of her children and grandchildren.\
  \ I was with her most of these time. Putting my candle with hers, trying to pray\
  \ with her but too tired to close my eyes and not fall asleep. it\xB4s was important\
  \ for her, because it was one of the moments in the year the all the family was\
  \ together and she was happy. She died 5 days after the new year\xB4s day. Everyone\
  \ was there like always. She was happy and fine. Then one day she left us.\n   \
  \   I was so worried about going back to this city, worried about me, but mainly\
  \ because of my mom. I know she misses grandma a lot. The first thing that I noticed\
  \ when I arrived there was the cornerstones of all Jesus\xB4 disciples on each one\
  \ in the front of the big church that is the tourist spot in the city and where\
  \ everyone in the country goes to pay their promises to Our Lady of Aparecida. It\xB4\
  s full all year, and in these last 5 years, they finally finished the restoration.\
  \ I never expected that kind of beauty, the backyards were green and people were\
  \ able to make a picnic, the did store under the church, with gift stores and coffee\
  \ houses. In front, it was a huge fountain representing David\xB4s sta, a wax museum,\
  \ and garden representing the Jesus\xB4 birth. Grandma would love it. We decided\
  \ to participate in the 9 a.m Mass before start to explore the city. All i thought\
  \ during the priest speech was my grandma, I saw her face in each elderly women,\
  \ playing with grandchildren, teasing her sons and buying gifts for the neighbors.\
  \  She was that kind of person who takes care of you so much but knows that sometimes\
  \ she needed to be mean to us to make us understand the lessons we needed. Sometimes\
  \ I cried, sometimes I laugh imagining her with me there, hugging me, giving me\
  \ advice about men, I wished she was there with me to teach how to pray, how to\
  \ not miss her this much. The mass ended and while exploring the city I bought a\
  \ candle for me. In the ended of the afternoon, I came back to the church and lighted\
  \ my candle and this little girl in a 20 years old body finally learned to pray.\
  \ I closed my eyes and she was there with me like she always did. Like she promised\
  \ me one day, in this same place, waking me up seconds before my candle falls from\
  \ my hand. After a reprimand, she told me \"I'll always take care of you\"."
