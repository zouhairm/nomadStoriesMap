Text: "Making our way to the Mount of Olives through the Muslim Quarter in Jerusalem,\
  \ a local shop owner kindly warned us about crowds ahead, so we backtracked to take\
  \ another route. Tension was rising, surely and swiftly, completely contradicting\
  \ the carefree stroll through the Cardo earlier that day through the small shops\
  \ stocked with pyramids of Arab spices of za\u2019 atar and sweets like kanafeh\
  \ and baklava. \n\nBanking a ridge obstructed by city walls, we began to hear chanting\
  \ and cheering which couldn't be stifled by a street full of children running directly\
  \ behind. After the dust settled and a short pause to perceive what exactly we were\
  \ hearing, I looked down and picked up a green marble left behind by the babes of\
  \ Jerusalem. Further along the route the noise intensified, mimicking cheers one\
  \ would imagine while watching the world cup. I grasped onto the green glass marble,\
  \ unsure what would we wound find around the corner. The cheers were neither joyful\
  \ nor threatening, rather frustration, passion, and a promise for action. \n\nLocals\
  \ rushed by, faces full of concern, with hesitant nonverbal insistence to take caution\
  \ ahead. The eyes of Israel reveal a deep-seated heartache on both sides of the\
  \ wall, hidden by a bold and fearless front, with unspoken curiosity and ferocity\
  \ for sharing the truth and accepting what is right. These eyes provided the missing\
  \ link between media, documentaries, and conversations held from the outside. \n\
  \nReaching our next turn, the road was barricaded by boisterous men with the belief\
  \ to be heard. Stone steps led to an intersection and a crossroads of four streets,\
  \ now consumed by a square full of souls, with no room to spare. Our second attempt\
  \ to reach the historical site became a blockade for religious freedom, a protest\
  \ against added security upon mosque entry. \n\nConcern and fear set in, with a\
  \ strong desire to turn around and run. A twenty-minute trek to reach the territory\
  \ gate was welcomed by a police barricade and a feeling of entrapment. One could\
  \ exit, but no one could enter. A wave of relief was rinsed away by the sound of\
  \ silenced shots, later identified as rubber bullets. Claustrophobic caution made\
  \ it seemingly harder to breath and helpless to humanize. The energy lessened upon\
  \ entering the city tram, with briefcases and boxes of groceries, carried by locals\
  \ headed home for dinner. The contrast clearly acknowledged that things are not\
  \ as they seem from the outside."
