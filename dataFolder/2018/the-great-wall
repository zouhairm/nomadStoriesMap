Text: "24th May 2017 - A day that will change my life forever. I've had a life where\
  \ I have never been too spontaneous and always stayed very much inside my comfort\
  \ zone\nThis day is when all that went out of the window and I signed up to \"The\
  \ Great Wall of China Trek\" to raise money for the Alzheimer's Society\" charity.\
  \ My grandad suffered with the illness shortly before he died and it seemed like\
  \ a great opportunity to challenge myself and also do some good for a very worthy\
  \ cause\n\nThis trip was to send me further outside of my comfort zone that I could\
  \ have ever imagined. I've always found social situations a bit of a struggle, and\
  \ meeting new people, I find very scary. I undertook a few months of fundraising\
  \ and training to prepare for what was to come. As the months past, I saw more people\
  \ registering for the trek, which caused me a lot of anxiety. As the numbers grew,\
  \ so did the amount of new people I would meet all at once\n\nFast forward to the\
  \ morning of 22nd October 2017 - the start of the trip. I said my goodbyes to my\
  \ fianc\xE9e and my parents and boarded a train from Manchester Piccadilly to London\
  \ Euston. The journey was just over 2 hours, just me and my thoughts. This caused\
  \ me to begin stressing again about the prospect of spending the next 10 days with\
  \ a bunch of strangers from all over the country. Will I like them? Will they like\
  \ me? What if we don't get on? - These were all questions going around my head\n\
  \nI arrived at Heathrow Airport at the Emirates Airlines entrance to see a group\
  \ of people, all with hiking bags at their feet and I was immediately greeted by\
  \ a lovely woman called Beverley, an Irish lady with a very strong accent. At first,\
  \ nerves got the better of me and I just stood with the rest of the group, not saying\
  \ anything unless I was directly spoken to. We all checked in and made our way through\
  \ security, no problems there. Still very nervous, I made my way to the plane with\
  \ no clue who I'd be sitting next to. I was booked into a middle seat and I introduced\
  \ myself to Nikki & Alison, who were seated either side of me. At this stage, I\
  \ began to relax and settle in as they were both lovely to talk to. \n\nBy the time\
  \ we reached Beijing, I had spoken to a lot of the group and was a lot more relaxed.\
  \ What followed is possibly the greatest 10 days of my life. Trekking 80km of the\
  \ Great Wall with a group of amazing people who I now consider one big family -\
  \ I wish I had more characters left to go into more detail, there is so much more\
  \ to tell!"
