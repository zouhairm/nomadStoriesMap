Text: "When privileged with a guitar, my soul guides my heart, and my heart guides\
  \ my hands. The steel strings press into the calloused flesh of my fingers. The\
  \ body\u2019s curves fits comfortably against mine, vibrating my belly as the instrument\
  \ sings what I ask of it. \n\n Dancing across six strings, I find peace. \n\n Deep\
  \ in the heart of Thailand, there was an old wooden guitar, a beautiful forgotten\
  \ relic with scars and stories to tell, waiting for me to come find it. It hung\
  \ gracefully in the dust, patiently waiting, ready to undertake it\u2019s first\
  \ adventure with me.\n\n I did not find it.\n\n Instead, I bartered with a remarkably\
  \ irate woman in the shady interior of her shop in Chiang Mai for the guitar that\
  \ found me. Shiny, unblemished, unloved. A timid instrument with stale strings that\
  \ quickly found it\u2019s place in my story.\n\n Weeks later, I found myself seeking\
  \ a hostel hidden down a dusty side street in Cambodia, situated next door to a\
  \ rum bar staffed only by a moustached runaway from Paris.\n\n The proprietor of\
  \ my accommodations was a beautiful young local woman, trailed by a boy of only\
  \ three or four with dark hair that emulated hers. \n\n The white walls of the hostel,\
  \ cornered and framed by thick, dark wood, held up what may righteously have been\
  \ a lifetime of carving. The ceiling didn\u2019t appear that the artist chiseled\
  \ at the wood to reveal grace, rather, moulded and sculpted it to match that which\
  \ lingered behind his eyes. The elegant contours of the upper limit opposed thick\
  \ slabs of rich hardwood that powerfully stretched the floor\u2019s entirety.\n\n\
  \ As she greeted me and we began to discuss my stay, her son took infatuation with\
  \ the mysterious instrument I grasped in my hand, mesmerized by it\u2019s secrets.\
  \ I squatted down, and he looked at me eagerly as I drew the guitar across my lap.\
  \ My hands finding their places on the strings, I strummed a single chord and let\
  \ the warm sound bounce from the corners of the room. He was in awe. Struck by the\
  \ same magic that rooted in me the relentless desire to understand the riddles of\
  \ the guitar. \n\n My left hand remaining on the neck, I motioned for him to take\
  \ the place of my right, and to his uncompromising joy, he did just that. \n\n \
  \       His small hands strumming the strings, I reshaped the chords and watched\
  \ his wondrous expression transform with them. The music filled his spirit with\
  \ love, and overflowed into mine. \n\n        Faces beaming back at each other,\
  \ the untranslatable notes held us forever in that moment."
