Text: "Venice is magical and majestic. Even the visible decay suggests its former\
  \ glory. So many footbridges and stairways to climb. Everything is tight corners\
  \ and narrow passageways, until a piazza fans out in front of you, stopping you\
  \ in your tracks as you stare at a church or cathedral, ornate in its piety. At\
  \ night the city glows, flickers of firelight dancing on the water.\n \nAn emerging\
  \ curator, I had come to Venice to see the famed Art Biennale. First organized in\
  \ 1895, almost a quarter of a million arts patrons and enthusiasts flocked to the\
  \ Giardini di Castello to see the first-ever international art exhibition. Even\
  \ the King and Queen, Umberto I and Margherita di Savoia graced the Giardini with\
  \ their presence.\n \nIn lieu of a royal welcome, I was greeted by hucksters set\
  \ up everywhere along the canals.  Small storefronts selling trinkets and handmade\
  \ luxuries sat side by side with cafes, restaurants and bars. On the surface, it\u2019\
  s a bit of a tourist trap. With such large crowds, and hordes of people pulling\
  \ luggage through the narrow alleyways, I was surprised to make a local connection.\n\
  \ \nAt the gates of Giardini della Biennale (as it\u2019s called today), I paid\
  \ the 25-euro entry fee to gain access to the 28 pavilions that have been built,\
  \ each in their own national style, permanent in their setting. The canals, throngs\
  \ of tourists, national pavilions, and the internationally-acclaimed artists and\
  \ their work all seemed foreign and exotic to me as an American -- especially with\
  \ so little Latin American or African representation in which to see myself reflected.\
  \ But the \u201Clocal connection\u201D came when I entered the American pavilion,\
  \ designed to look like Thomas Jefferson\u2019s Monticello. Curated by Christopher\
  \ Bedford and Katy Siegel of the Baltimore Museum of Art, artist Mark Bradford\u2019\
  s work was uncanny in its aesthetic and in its timeliness. Bradford desecrated the\
  \ stately pavilion with mounds of gravel, adorned with cigarette butts and strewn\
  \ with detritus, visually suggesting a ruin. Inside were large forms almost like\
  \ tumors, or festering pustules that devoured the whole of the space and forced\
  \ the viewer to negotiate a path through the interior gallery along its margins.\
  \ The last thing I expected to see was the truth of my own experience as a racialized,\
  \ gendered and/or marginalized subject represented with depth and nuance, especially\
  \ in a foreign land. It was absolutely brilliant. Befitting of Venice\u2019s majesty,\
  \ flickers of my own light danced in the Giardini."
