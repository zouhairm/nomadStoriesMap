Text: "I fly south, skirting the edge of the river, racing the muddy Mississippi to\
  \ the gulf. The miles pass below us, marked only by the movement of my index finger\
  \ following a pencil line across the sectional chart I hold in my lap. Quincy, Hannibal,\
  \ Troy, Bonne Terre, Cape Girardeau, Cairo. Hours pass only slightly slower than\
  \ the miles. \n\nMy Aeronca Champ was built in 1947. If there's a headwind, her\
  \ eighty horsepower engine doesn't keep pace with the cars below us, but I've learned\
  \ to be grateful for her pace. From the cockpit my eyes map out the contours of\
  \ the land like a hand slowly tracing the contours of a lover's face. It's almost\
  \ sunset, but it's still warm. I keep my right hand on the control stick while I\
  \ unlatch the cockpit window, thrusting my left hand into the propeller's slipstream.\
  \ The roar of the engine is deafening, but the cool air is worth the extra noise.\
  \ \n\nFrom fifteen hundred feet I look down. Gentle hills lay shrouded in thick\
  \ foliage. Occasionally the green curtain opens to tiny rooftops, quiet kitchen\
  \ gardens and miniature Ford trucks parked kattywampus on gravel drives. Sacred\
  \ worlds that belong to souls I may never meet. I wonder who they are. If I landed\
  \ my airplane in their fields would I find barefoot children playing on that wide\
  \ front porch, snatching at the fireflies that will soon be blinking in the dusk?\
  \ I glimpse tiny pieces of life as I fly - people, places, ideas - pieces that interlock\
  \ like the forgotten springs and gears in a clock. Though invisible, they move the\
  \ whole face of the earth. My own heart is moved because of them.\n\nI bank east,\
  \ crossing three rivers in quick succession: the Mississippi, the Ohio and the Tennessee.\
  \ In one, a paddlewheeler churns slowly upstream. The sinking sun glints off the\
  \ backside of the Champ's propeller. As I near the airfield, I key my hand held\
  \ radio \"Kentucky Dam area traffic, Aeronca 85018 entering left downwind for 27,\
  \ Kentucky Dam.\" I'm answered with static. \"Kentucky Dam area traffic, Aeronca\
  \ 85018 final for runway 27, Kentucky Dam.\" There's no control tower here. The\
  \ airspace around Kentucky Lake is silent. \n\nI touch down near dark to the deserted\
  \ airfield. There's no old man in suspenders here to pump my fuel like there was\
  \ in Iowa corn country yesterday. \"We don't see too many sweethearts come in here\
  \ flying taildraggers,\" he had told me. Perhaps not. But perhaps that will change.\n\
  \nI pitch my tent beside the Champ's wing, leaving the door hanging open to let\
  \ in the stars."
