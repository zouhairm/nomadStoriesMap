Text: "Late September night in Manhattan would have been ordinary if  a message didn't\
  \ arrived. \nI've heard the news that there is hurricane in Puerto Rico, but affected\
  \ by personal tragedy I thought It will all end soon. After all, it was supposed\
  \ to be my spot to recover from the lost.\n    \"Dear Grozdanova, for your own safety...\"\
  \ It was the landlord advise not to go. \nI found myself trapped between my latest\
  \ decision to just enjoy life and all those google pictures I saw of the catastrophe\
  \ in Puerto Rico.\nOne moment. One decision.The one that pushed me to the edge.\n\
  \"Oh goo\"- I said to myself.\n\"Sofia, please be real, you want tranquility and\
  \ comfort\"- Said the other voice within me\n   Tears  moistured my cheeks.The pain\
  \ didn't gave me opportunity  to stop crying. Detest the feeling of helpless. Me\
  \ in USA, she in Macedonia. For a moment I asked myself how many people feel the\
  \ same as I felt. Than  I remembered her again. My Angela. My angel...not able to\
  \ hug her for last time. \n   Wiped away tears with my shirt. Passport and backpack.\n\
  Three things headed to JFK that night : Me, my broken soul  and ashes of the past.\n\
  \     I arrived in San Juan late afternoon. The landlord Sabrina 66 said she couldn't\
  \ provide essentials for my stay. I didn't ask for any. \nThe thirst to help all\
  \ those people, was stronger than any other feeling I have ever had. I couldn't\
  \ be indifferent. Not now. Not here.\n\u0415ven if the sky and ground become one\
  \ I choose to help all those people.\n  Sabrina woke me up early around 6am. Her\
  \ tranquility was replaced with fear and shaking-her pregnant daughter did not came\
  \ back from hospital that morning. \nThe pouring rain and wind outside were terrifying.\
  \ The possibility I will not come back alive was around every corner. But the fire\
  \ within me could light up many lives. \nFirst time I prayed to God. All I asked\
  \ was more days under the sun. Got into my fishing boots and  went out. The streets\
  \ were all in water, no people and the strong wind made it impossible to see what's\
  \ in front of you. Trees, plastic chairs and flooding water made it worse.\nOh,\
  \ where i'm gone a find you. Passed a few blocks. Desperate that my search won't\
  \ give result, with all my strength I started yelling \"Maria Mariaa\". I barely\
  \ saw her hidden on a stair. With broken water and help of locals we went home.\
  \ \nAround 7am she delivered baby girl. \nThe smell of new life made me feel my\
  \ rebirth.\nMy broken pieces were finally together.\nNow I can fly to new heights.\
  \ \nJust like Phoenix."
