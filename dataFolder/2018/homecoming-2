Text: "Right then and there I saw the reaction in my dad\u2019s eyes. I stopped to\
  \ take a look around. To many, all there was were run-down houses, pothole infested\
  \ streets, and enormous tropical trees decorating the broken sidewalk. \u201CAca\
  \ es donde creci\u201D said my father. I am a nomad at heart, as if I had a particular\
  \ gene from the nomadic people that continued to be passed on through my ancestors.\
  \ A long time ago my heritage derived from Spain. My parents, both Colombian originally,\
  \ migrated to Venezuela at a young age where they met and had me. Together we then\
  \ migrated to the States. Later on I started my own migration path up to the North\
  \ and since then have traveled around the world settling in new places, discovering\
  \ new homes. As soon as we entered the airport in Barranquilla, I could see my family\
  \ members from the plane window. The pilot announced over the microphone \u201C\
  Bienvenidos a Colombia\u201D and everyone clapped in the traditional Latin American\
  \ manner. Latin people are passionate about everything, even about landing safely,\
  \ gotta love it. The environment is dry, hot, with a sporadic breeze that teases\
  \ you for a break but doesn\u2019t hold. Driving to our home is a maze, the moto-taxis\
  \ are everywhere, challenging the most well-seasoned driver. We wanted to take a\
  \ tour of my father\u2019s old stomping grounds. He grew up in what at the time\
  \ was a middle class neighborhood, close to the market and the main church of the\
  \ city. Currently, this is a rougher area of the country. As we entered the street\
  \ the energy in the car changed. The jetlag and tiredness from the plane ride was\
  \ quickly overwhelmed by the jovial stories my dad and his brother shared. \u201C\
  Te acuerdas de las Chachis\u201D their Barranquillan accent grew stronger. The car\
  \ stopped and my dad\u2019s complete awareness of safety dissipated, He got out\
  \ of the car and looked at this white house with two big windows for a while. He\
  \ was in the moment, enjoying and at the same time you could in his face the emotions\
  \ his childhood brought with. I took a picture of him on the stoop, looking out\
  \ the street, the house in the background, imagining what life what would have been\
  \ like a long time ago. At that time, in that place, seeing my father come back\
  \ to his roots I realized and understood where mine came from too. It doesn\u2019\
  t take extreme far distances or foreign lands to make that local connection. In\
  \ a placed I had never been to before I learned very easily where I came from."
