Text: "The day my boss told me I was going to go to the Hebridies, I actually didn't\
  \ even know where the Hebridies were. When I searched for them on Google Maps I\
  \ nearly had an heart attack: I had been in the Scottish Highlands for three months,\
  \ close to Inverness, and I thought I couldn't have gone further north. A small\
  \ part of me was still curious to see what Highlands had to offer, but the bigger\
  \ one was only worried about how windy and cold it could have been, even if it was\
  \ July.\nThe truth is that, after an initial crush for that land, so different from\
  \ the chaotic city of Milan I used to live in, in a couple of months I began to\
  \ get bored of the bright colors of the landscape, the astonishing silence filling\
  \ wide open spaces and small towns of 5000 people defined as \"cities\": I had travelled\
  \ all over the Scottish Highlands and every place started looking the same to me.\n\
  Highlands are incredibly poetic, but I felt the need of a little prose and the idea\
  \ of spending a full week in a sort of nowhere land wasn't so exciting anymore.\
  \ I started counting the weeks left before the end of my internship, I really didn't\
  \ know how Scottish people could live there without going mad.\nWe arrived to Lewis\
  \ Island by an old ferry boat and then took a car to Stornoway. Out of my window\
  \ everything was green and light blue and silent, with no sign of a city nearby,\
  \ and I experienced the \"rush hour in Scotland\" seen in a postcard, with the car\
  \ stuck in a flock of sheep.\nThe road was narrow and the landscape couldn't have\
  \ been less surprising. Italy had never felt so distant.\nI yawned and my hot breath\
  \ fogged up the window. I looked through the vanishing fog, wishing I could be in\
  \ a crowded shopping centre on a saturday evening, when, as a dream, he appeared:\
  \ in a green and brown field, full of rocks and small bushes, a young man wearing\
  \ a kilt was playing a pipe. There was no reason to play there, nobody but us could\
  \ hear him, he had probably driven for at least 20 minutes to go there.\nI was so\
  \ surprised I didn't manage to take a picture, but that image is still fixed in\
  \ my mind: a man in the middle of nowhere playing a pipe in his kilt. \nIt disclosed\
  \ to me all the beauty of Scotland that I was missing."
