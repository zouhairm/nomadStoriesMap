Text: "When I boldly moved to Spain to teach English after graduation, I knew no one\
  \ there, I spoke little-to-no Spanish at the time, and I had no housing. The Spanish\
  \ Ministry of Education teaching program didn\u2019t offer housing and my only real\
  \ game plan for housing was three nights in a hotel in rainy, gray Santiago de Compostela.\
  \ As I struggled to find decent housing, I felt regret creeping into the back of\
  \ my mind and the thought of moving back home came to mind. After my short hotel\
  \ stint, I had to go to a hostel for a few days thereafter, but at least I had started\
  \ teaching and I was introduced to Rebeca--my school principal\u2019s daughter and\
  \ my saving grace.\n\nLuckily, Rebeca came to the rescue and patiently helped me\
  \ look for housing everyday after school for two full weeks. During those jam-packed\
  \ fourteen days, she took me to every apartment with an open room in the city. We\
  \ looked at ads online, we looked at ads in the street, and she called and talking\
  \ to everyone on my behalf. After each day, on average, we would visit with a couple\
  \ apartments a day, and she would have a piece of paper with all the information\
  \ and she would recap all of the details in slow, deliberate Spanish and I would\
  \ catch half of it, at best. \n\nEventually, Rebeca found out that her former colleague,\
  \ Luisa, had an open attic apartment that she was willing to rent to me. Not only\
  \ did Luisa agree to rent me the whole apartment to me, but she did it with no formal\
  \ contract and a monthly flat rate. Without Rebeca\u2019s help, I would have never\
  \ found an apartment and I\u2019m not sure I would have stayed in Spain long term.\
  \ Within the following months, I fell in love with Santiago de Compostela so much\
  \ that I went back the year after.\n\nWhen I returned to Santiago de Compostela\
  \ the next school year, before the start of my teaching contract, I decided to take\
  \ a last-second trip to Italy that only happened because Rebeca was there for me.\
  \ Before I was going to head to the airport, I tried to take cash out of the ATM\
  \ machine, but my card was eaten by the machine and all I could do was call Rebeca.\
  \ She asked me where I was and she came within ten minutes, she took out her own\
  \ cash for me to take with me on the trip, and her boyfriend Javier took me to the\
  \ airport in record time. \n\nWithin the next 4 years of moving to Spain, I completed\
  \ a Masters in Spanish from a Spanish university and I passed Spain\u2019s highest\
  \ Spanish course offered through their state-run language school, and I owe it all\
  \ to Rebeca."
