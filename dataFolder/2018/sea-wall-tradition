Text: "We stood on the cement wall that protected the island from tsunamis and watched\
  \ as white froth flew and crashed on the horizon. They told me that I had to jump.\
  \ The kids explained that it was fun and almost everyone jumps when they first move\
  \ to Okinawa. The breeze blew hot like summertime breath and humidity tickled my\
  \ lungs. I exhaled and told them that I would do it next time. They laughed and\
  \ dragged me with them. The kids tucked their socks into their shoes and left them\
  \ on the sidewalk. They climbed over the wall and down large cement jacks with ease.\
  \ I followed nervously. The cement was hot but not unbearable and it had been smoothed\
  \ by brave waves that tore past the reef every now and then. I couldn't help but\
  \ look into the dark gaps between the jacks and imagine myself falling into them.\
  \ I envisioned habu snakes or mongooses waiting for one of us to slip into their\
  \ fangs. \nWe walked parallel to the sea following the up and down path of the jacks.\
  \ They led me to a tall leg that jetted into the sky. It had a bright blue arrow\
  \ painted on it that pointed to one of the few clouds above us. One of the guys\
  \ that led us from the school was the first to jump. He flew off the edge without\
  \ a second thought and I watched as he met the sea with a smile on his face. I looked\
  \ over the edge and saw more cement between me and the sea. If I didn't jump far\
  \ enough I would smash into the jacks below. I glanced at the kids watching, one\
  \ of them yawned and another laughed shaking his head. \n I told myself to jump.\
  \ Bright purple fish darted away as if they expected the interruption. My heart\
  \ hit my chest as hard as my feet hit the stone while I pushed myself off the ground\
  \ and into the air. The wind blew through my hair as I held my limbs as close to\
  \ my body as possible. I could hear the kids cheering as I crashed like the waves\
  \ on the reef. I felt soft coral sand beneath my feet and opened my eyes. I met\
  \ the purple fish as they poked out of cracks and holes in the reef to see me. Even\
  \ a lion fish was swimming by a few feet away. It looked surprisingly gentle. I\
  \ watched orange and red lights dance on the surface in the waves that my body created.\
  \ The sun was setting. I pulled myself out of the water unable to hide the smile\
  \ on my face. The adrenaline I felt that day has inspired me to experience everything\
  \ I can and to never let the fear of what might happen stop me. Back then I jumped\
  \ to escape the insecurities of being wanted or not. Now I jump to enjoy a view."
