Text: "\u201CIsland of the gods\u201D, its affectionately known as, that is the island\
  \ of Bali. Given its spectacular beauty, it is much like stepping into a living\
  \ postcard with its pure serenity, its spirituality, and its mellow lifestyle. As\
  \ I walked, a dark, but well-aged hand reached out and gently touched my arm. \u201C\
  Hello, I am Ketut Puka \u2013 what is you name?\u201D, the short and almost toothless\
  \ elderly man asked. \u201CCome sit, sit, with me - give me you hand\u201D, he asked\
  \ in a cheeky broken English as he reached, outstretching his arm toward me. I was\
  \ mesmerised by his demur and his gentle touch. He ran his knobbly old fingers over\
  \ the palm of my hand as he pressed his fingers against what he referred to as;\
  \ my life line, fate and sun lines. We sat on a large weaved, brightly coloured\
  \ mat, he sat across from me with his little legs crossed and tucked up under his\
  \ bottom, he stared directly at me. \u201CYou have much pain, much loss, but now\
  \ much happiness\u201D. I was speechless, I had no idea what he meant. \u201CYou\
  \ find happiness in here\u201D, he told me as he raised his arm toward his chest\
  \ while clenching his stiffened hand up against his heart. He pounded gently against\
  \ his heart, \u201CYou finally happy in here\u201D, he emphasised, still gently\
  \ thumping against his chest while his infectious laugh and vivacious, toothless,\
  \ smile appeared to cover his entire face, which resembled a heavily detailed roadmap.\
  \ I was in awe of this man, healer and palm reader, he had not really given me any\
  \ relevant information, but I felt as though he had given me a blessing, I felt\
  \ such warmth and happiness as I sat and watched his enchanting smile still dancing\
  \ across his face. As I sat and curiously watched him I was beginning to understand\
  \ what he was trying to convey to me, that true happiness comes from loving yourself\
  \ and comes from deep within and only then will I find true happiness. As I walked\
  \ away I felt a strange sensation churning up inside of me. Had I found spirituality?\
  \ or had I just found something, perhaps my own happiness that had just gotten totally\
  \ lost inside of me. Either way, Ketut Puka had certainly somehow changed me and\
  \ made an impact on my life, just like the island of Bali.\n\n\n."
