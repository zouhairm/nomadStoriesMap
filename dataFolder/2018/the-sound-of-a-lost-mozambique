Text: "Bright blue graffiti is emblazoned on the crumbling walls;\n\n\u2018Turn your\
  \ mistakes into lessons and your feats into hopes.'\n\nSanta Cruz\u2019s hotel stands\
  \ lonely upon the shores that meet the turquoise blue water and startling white\
  \ sand of the Bazaruto Archipelago. Mozambique- simply full of surprises. Since\
  \ I arrived just over a month ago, my perceptions of African history and politics\
  \ have been completely turned upside down. 'Paradise\u2019 island is no exception.\
  \ The stories flow. The stories of luxury, of excess, of visits from the rich and\
  \ famous. The seventies; a tourism boom for the tiny two mile island. \u2018Paradise\u2019\
  \ realised for the lucky few visiting during peaceful times. Now, the skeletal frame\
  \ of the once grand Santa Cruz hotel stands as a stark reminder of Mozambique\u2019\
  s turbulent and terrible past.\n\nShielding shadows where they once reflected the\
  \ sunlight, we wander through the corridors, finding ourselves in an opening of\
  \ what must have been the grandest room. A piano sits, just recognisable under the\
  \ dust and debris that has settled upon its body. I approach, settle a hand gently\
  \ upon the keys and press, sending a note singing and echoing through this abandoned\
  \ shell of a building. Marcello turns and laughs; \n\n\u201COnce played by Bob Dylan\
  \ that piano\u201D he says in his cheery mismatched Portuguese, \u201Cnot quite\
  \ the same now though.\u201D\n\n\u201CSeriously? That\u2019s insane- he stayed here?\u201D\
  \n\nI suddenly consider; that Bob Dylan song \u2018Mozambique\u2019. Of course.\
  \ That makes more sense now.\n\nI close my eyes just for a second\u2026 it\u2019\
  s 1975, Dylan sits at the piano. He plays, experiments, taps upon its keys. Guests\
  \ jeer and jostle, Santa Cruz is exuberant, full of life, an oasis escaping the\
  \ problems of the mainland. The song; a proclamation of Mozambican independence\
  \ that is so far from expressing the real struggles of country about to enter a\
  \ bloody, violent civil war. Dylan\u2019s lyrics sing in my head; \n\n'And you see\
  \ why it's so unique to be\nAmong the lovely people living free\nUpon the beach\
  \ of sunny Mozambique'\n\nMy mind turns to thinking how easy it is for us to simply\
  \ be listeners, caught up in the luxury that our visit to 'paradise' may bring,\
  \ whilst being so ignorant to the past or present struggles of the country we are\
  \ visiting. Of how this abandoned skeleton of a building represents paradise and\
  \ luxury but simultaneously brutality and wickedness. Of how this small island has\
  \ revealed so much, and will leave me endlessly wondering what other surprises may\
  \ come my way."
