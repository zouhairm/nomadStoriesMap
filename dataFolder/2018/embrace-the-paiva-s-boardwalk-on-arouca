Text: "Where to go when we have just a day to spend? Just find a great landscape and\
  \ sculpt it with your eyes. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve done in Arouca, Portugal.\
  \ It\u2019s a World Travel Awards winner since 2016.\nThe best way to do it for\
  \ an average person is when we start at the entrance on Areinho and we walk from\
  \ end to end, ending that walk on Espiunca. At start it seems quite difficult because\
  \ of the uphill ahead but it\u2019s just 400 meters. Then almost all the route forward\
  \ is downhill \u2013 it\u2019s when you can really enjoy the Nature around you.\n\
  On the footpath you can find intact Nature with a lot of shaded areas that can make\
  \ you feel proud with all the sounds around. Natural animals, like turtles \u2013\
  \ I\u2019ve seen one \u2013 can be found there down the river and your eyes can\
  \ appreciate the time-out from the human world. Beautiful colors, stones and some\
  \ riverside beaches to rest.\nWhen I\u2019ve made that boardwalk I have to admit\
  \ it that my hopes weren\u2019t a lot high because \u2013 you know \u2013 it\u2019\
  s just a wood stuff under our feet. But there\u2019s something magic about untouched\
  \ places that makes us feel part of something bigger. You can see the trees with\
  \ the wind and sense the sun on your skin as if you\u2019re a part of a tribe.\n\
  In each step you take and choose to look up the sky or down the river it\u2019s\
  \ like magical creatures singing on the background \u2013 and there\u2019s just\
  \ birds. If you have a camera, just look everywhere! I enjoyed so much taking pictures\
  \ of me, the water of the river, the wooden bars on the ground, the stones that\
  \ almost carry all the weight of our feet.\nIf you know how it\u2019s like to feel\
  \ the Nature near and sound, you should make this trip. If you don\u2019t like Nature\
  \ so much you can enjoy it too as a footpath that just follows the river. No flies\
  \ or mosquitoes to disturb your way. And when you\u2019re tired, you can rest. There\
  \ is a nice taxi service too for people who can\u2019t make it back. Meet friends\
  \ with cars in each way of the pathway and you can go back without the cab.\nHow\
  \ much will you need to enter that peaceful place? You may ask. With just 1 euro\
  \ per person you can lose yourself down the path of 8 kilometers \u2013 limited\
  \ to a number of 3500 people a day.\nYou can preorder it from their site \u2018\
  passadicosdopaiva.pt\u2019. Enjoy it on any day of the year! It\u2019s open from\
  \ April to October from 7hrs and half to 8hrs pm and you can go too on November\
  \ to March it\u2019s from 9hrs am to 5 hrs pm.\nTake some water, comfortable shoes\
  \ and enjoy the view! Oh, and don\u2019t forget the sunscreen. It\u2019s a very\
  \ sunny place."
