Text: "In the middle of the Balearic Sea, lies a boho fairyland of sandy beaches and\
  \ yoga retreats. The entire country of Spain\u2019s concept of gratification beams\
  \ from this patch. That\u2019s right. It\u2019s like a holy retreat, a destination\
  \ with its own rules. A part of it is a temple for all the wicked, superficial things\
  \ a man desires: money, sex, and antidotes. Here, all that is unprincipled and flimsy\
  \ in Spanish Culture has been overhauled into a sparkling mold, covered in magic\
  \ and somehow made right. It\u2019s dazzling and flawed at the same time. Ibiza\
  \ is more than just an island in the middle of wide waters; it\u2019s a part of\
  \ Spain\u2019s life force itself.\n\n \LPalm Trees, blue water, and massive resorts\
  \ on either side of the route, a two-line road jammed with fancy restaurants and\
  \ clubs. As you walk down it, you\u2019re surrounded by bikini babes, beach beds\
  \ and gigantic beach resorts- like somewhere Super Mario would live. The whole city\
  \ is like a theme park. It\u2019s Willy Wonka meets the world - and glitz. I expect\
  \ to see piranhas to come and drown the entire island like a movie set. It\u2019\
  s that kind of place. It\u2019s extraordinary. But damn right it is fun. In a single\
  \ day, you can drown in the sun gaze, get lost in a club, have dinner with flamenco\
  \ dancers around and end up in the red light district with weird old people cram\
  \ for some pleasure. You can see the men surfing between huge waves, girls wooing\
  \ after every sentence they speak, flamenco dancers tapping their feet till they\u2019\
  re numb, girls dressed in nothing but paint in the clubs. Everything is reckless,\
  \ blitzed and loud. Everyone's a clubber in Ibiza. Even the shopkeepers, doctors\
  \ and housewives. The island's economy is based purely on clubbing. At the airport,\
  \ you are asked to show your best moves to gain access.\n\nGambling is another thing\
  \ in Ibiza which is extravagant, you play blackjack for an hour and earn 60 euros,\
  \ you feel like Dan Bilzerian. You play Baccarat for 30 minutes and lose 100 euros,\
  \ you feel like Ted Mosby from How I Met Your Mother. Entire rooms are filled with\
  \ slot machines. But the most pleasure-seeking experience of all isn\u2019t even\
  \ imaginable. Flyboarding. On this paradise of beaches with its crystalline turquoise\
  \ waters and white sand, walking on water is a miracle come true.\n\n \L\LWhen you're\
  \ there, you see Ibiza for what it is: a magical paradise in a wilderness of silence\
  \ and seawater. So in the context of numeric digits, Ibiza gets a 100/100 from my\
  \ side. It\u2019s a world of its own rights."
