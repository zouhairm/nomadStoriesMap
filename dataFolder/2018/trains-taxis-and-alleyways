Text: "My English wasn't as helpful traveling in Vietnam. Most people I encountered\
  \ would stare at me when I tried to pronounce street names or point to a phrase\
  \ in my guidebook. \n\nBut I remember one night when I managed to book a train from\
  \ Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh City using a combination of poor pronunciation, diagrams,\
  \ and charades in what would be the weirdest 48 hour trip of my life. \n\nThe train\
  \ from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh City is an overnight trip. It was dark outside when\
  \ I boarded and walked into a room the size of a closet with a set of bunk beds.\
  \ I stepped on the thin plastic mattress of the bottom bunk and hurled my bag to\
  \ the top climbing up after it and collapsing after a long day of walking. \n\n\
  I fell asleep only to wake up to a smoke filled cabin, realizing that two men had\
  \ joined me in the room and they were playing cards and smoking. They looked at\
  \ me, I pointed at the no smoking sign and they looked back at their cards. I didn't\
  \ get any more sleep as I was coated in their smoke.\n\nIt was late when I got to\
  \ the Ho Chi Minh train station, but I found a taxi that looked official so I got\
  \ in and showed the driver the address on my hostel booking confirmation.\n\nThe\
  \ hostel was only a couple miles from the train station and I was ready for a shower\
  \ and a smoke free room, but I got nervous the longer the ride lasted. \n\n\"How\
  \ far?\" I asked. \n\n\"No!\" He pointed to a different sheet of paper with the\
  \ picture of a different Hotel. \n\nWith little sleep and patience I raised my voice.\
  \ \n\n\"No,\" I pointed to my address. \n\nOut of nowhere he slammed on his breaks\
  \ and in perfect English he said, \"Get out!\"\n\nHe looked irate, so I grabbed\
  \ my bag and jumped out of the car. Only then realizing that I was in an abandoned\
  \ alley in the middle of the night in Vietnam. \n\nI was petrified. \n\nI scanned\
  \ the alley looking for anything that could provide a glimpse of hope. I picked\
  \ up my pace when I saw people taking notice of the American with a backpack walking\
  \ around in the dark. \n\nThen, in the distance I saw a sign with Vietnamese writing,\
  \ but under it was the word \"Guesthouse\". I was saved. In my mind as I walked\
  \ towards it footsteps were following me. \n\nI rang the bell and waited. A light\
  \ came on a few stories above the entrance and in a couple minutes the door opened.\
  \ In front of me stood a one-eyed woman in a robe that said, \"One room.\"\n\nI\
  \ looked at the woman and the dark house behind her and then looked back into the\
  \ alley. I took my chance in the guesthouse and stepped inside."
