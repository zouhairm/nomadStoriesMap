Text: "It was late afternoon, dark tropical clouds hung low in the sky oppressing\
  \ the heavy African heat. The dirt road that stretched through the little community\
  \ of villages on the outskirts of Arusha was busy with women prepared for the oncoming\
  \ downpour, their colourful dresses and head wraps blurring to a fatidic rainbow.\n\
  I had experienced the impending deluge that could be life changing, washing away\
  \ whole walls of flimsy houses, carving out cliff-like banks in the road and causing\
  \ stagnant streams to become ferocious torrents. \nIt was the end of my day as a\
  \ teacher in the local school. Tired, I was not looking forward to the hour long\
  \ odyssey back to my lodgings by Dalla Dalla, the local answer to public transport\
  \ -a minivan bursting its doors and conducted by the worlds most carefree drivers.\n\
  \u2018Mzungu! Mzungu!\u2019\nThe children playing in the dust stopped their games,\
  \ voices full of excited laughter at the colour of my skin, still noticeably white\
  \ beneath layers of dirt, suntan and profusion of copper bangles. I waved, noticing\
  \ the gruesome sores on their dusty skin and bloated bellies. They turned back to\
  \ their makeshift toys, seemingly uninterested in the looming darkness beyond the\
  \ banana trees.\n\nI turned down a side track, the short cut to the next Dalla stop.\
  \ It was quieter, already most people were inside, the smell of cooking wafted into\
  \ the tree canopy. \nI gasped as something hit the side of my face, bouncing away\
  \ across a ditch. It was a plastic ball, faded to an off pink. I looked around to\
  \ see its origin in this seemingly empty part of town. \nPeering from behind a pattered\
  \ sheet in a doorway, a emaciated face looked directly at me. A pool of liquid darkness\
  \ in a hollow face, the eye intently contemplated me with curiosity. I smiled reassuringly\
  \ and the face of a young boy emerged from the dim shadows, his left cheek and eye\
  \ masked by a grim, dirty bandage. I felt a familiar pang of hopelessness. \nThe\
  \ boys good eye shifted to the ball and back me. I nodded in understanding and jumped\
  \ the ditch that was far too wide for his tiny frame to retrieve this prized possession.\
  \ \nI crouched as he tottered over, taking the ball from my outstretched arms, clutching\
  \ it close to him. \nOur eyes met again. Mutuality. \n\u2018Asante\u2019 he whispered\
  \ his thanks and giggled, a flash of pure joy lighting his face.\n\u2018Karibu\u2019\
  \ I smiled back. \nHe reached out and touched my fingers, squeezing them in his\
  \ tiny hand. \nA drop of water splashed down my cheek. \nIt had began to rain."
