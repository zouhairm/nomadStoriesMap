Text: "We walked past the silhouettes of the Chinese fishing nets against the orange\
  \ sky, right into Princess Street, our favorite! Quick flashback into the colonial\
  \ era when Fort Kochi used to be a Dutch colony -  this street lined on two sides\
  \ with bright colored, well-lit array of houses is now turned into boutiques, antique\
  \ shops and cafes. By now, we reached the end of it, all the while looking for The\
  \ Teapot. At the crossroad, the man pointed towards a dark street with one flickering\
  \ streetlamp, assuring us that the place should be there. Going ahead a few steps,\
  \ he turned back to only find us still standing on the other side of the road. It\
  \ definitely didn't look like we were going to move any further! He laughed to himself\
  \ like he knew why and walked a few more steps ahead. Before he could cross the\
  \ lamp into the darkness, he stopped. With a heave of excitement, he called upon\
  \ us by waving his hands high. We ran towards him, past three doors and to our right\
  \ side we saw a fourth door in a wall of thick greens, and a tiny black board at\
  \ the door which read 'The Teapot'. The door opened into a hall room with teapots\
  \ in different sizes placed in shelves, and a big round glass table taking up almost\
  \ all of the space. Walking around the table led into an inner room with tables\
  \ for two, and a narrow creaky flight of wooden steps up to the attic. The steps\
  \ ended into a small space with the roof almost touching our heads.  We sat right\
  \ next to an old music player by the door that led to the terrace. With some old\
  \ Classic songs playing in the background, it took us only a few minutes to get\
  \ into deep conversations - about books, movies, music, art, travel, food and all\
  \ that we had a common interest on. Savoring each sip of tea, in time we found ourselves\
  \ talking about the true meaning of freedom, about finding your passion, doing what\
  \ we love, and without even us pausing to realize, four hours had flown by. \nThe\
  \ clock struck ten at a church nearby. We started walking back down the same Princess\
  \ Street, to a nearby ferry terminal. We saw him off from there -gleaming faces\
  \ waving bye to each other -and that was when it struck us that we hadn't asked\
  \ our names to each other! That night, a lot of our ideas changed. Ideas about true\
  \ identity, ides about the society, ideas about priorities, it all had a new meaning.\
  \ We were strangers, and we remained strangers. What started off as the last evening\
  \ of being free turned into the beginning of a new-found freedom. Of mind, of heart."
