Text: "\u201CYou look so sad.\u201D\n\nI groaned inwardly. He hadn\u2019t looked my\
  \ way for hours, but now, as we were finally nearing the end, my seatmate decided\
  \ to disturb what had been a perfectly comfortable silence. Reluctantly, I turned\
  \ to a pair of watery eyes pleading for my story.\n\n\u201CSad\u201D was a cop-out.\
  \ After losing my best friend, I\u2019d spent the past year numb to everything except\
  \ memories, and any attempts to move forward were met with spectacular failure.\
  \ \n\nNow, taking a break from the covers of my bed, I was crammed into a bus on\
  \ a six-hour ride to a stuffy old town. To sweeten my misery, the double-decker\
  \ was fighting off a global-warming-enhanced African summer with several broken\
  \ air cons. \n\nBut not one to unload on a stranger, I replied feebly, \u201CJust\
  \ tired \u2026 didn\u2019t sleep last night,\u201D before closing my eyes and leaning\
  \ against the scuffed window pane.\n\nOblivious, the man began pelting me: Why hadn\u2019\
  t I slept? Where was I going? Who was I meeting? \n\nI sidestepped the interrogation\
  \ and turned the questions on him, a diversion he accepted easily. As he chattered\
  \ about his village and move to the city, my thoughts slunk away for respite. \n\
  \nSo deeply was I indulging in melancholy that I almost missed the casual mention\
  \ of his son\u2019s death. \n\n\u201CWha-What happened?\u201D I stammered. \n\n\u201C\
  He got sick one day and there was no car. Someone eventually gave us a ride, but\
  \ he died on the way to the clinic. The nurses, they couldn\u2019t even tell us\
  \ what happened.\u201D\n\nSkipping over my pity, his gaze followed the banana plantations\
  \ sailing by. The seconds trickled; renewed grief crept between us before he spoke\
  \ again.\n\n\u201CWe kept trying for another boy and got four daughters instead.\
  \ It must be God\u2019s plan.\u201D\n\nThere is no plan, because God doesn\u2019\
  t exist. \n\nI nodded quickly before the words could escape my mouth. \n\n\u201C\
  Things are good though,\u201D he continued. \u201CMy wife has her own business.\
  \ The girls are in school, and I\u2019m working hard so they\u2019re educated. Men\
  \ and women must be\u2014\u201D\n\nHis face suddenly brightened as something ahead\
  \ caught his attention: the conductor had signalled my stop. \n\nOdd \u2026 was\
  \ he happy to see me go?\n\nAs I gathered my things and shuffled into the aisle,\
  \ I remembered that we hadn\u2019t introduced ourselves. I turned, but the man was\
  \ already stretched across both seats, looking out at a dam brimming from the recent\
  \ rains. \n\nRealizing it didn\u2019t matter, I went on.\n\nHe was an advanced student\
  \ at the School of Loss, soon to graduate. I was just a freshman, still reeling\
  \ after my first semester."
