Text: "In December 2015, I embarked upon my first solo backpacking trip to New Zealand.\
  \ Having done little planning in advance, I was feeling a little anxious, but excited\
  \ for the prospect of exploring a new land that I had come to know so much about.\
  \ \n\nI had a few ideas on what to do, where to stay, food, transportation etc,\
  \ however, my itinerary was fairly open-ended. I guess I wanted to stay flexible\
  \ and spontaneous and was making reservations on the fly.\n\nMy first stop was Paihia\
  \ on the North Island. Having arrived in Auckland, I took the Intercity bus to Paihia,\
  \ which is a great place to explore the Bay of Islands. I checked into a hostel\
  \ and was sharing the room with three other travelers from Germany. The highlight\
  \ of my stay was Bay of Islands sailing cruise. We sailed into the Bay through several\
  \ Islands and anchored our Yacht near an Island to explore the cove. On the Island\
  \ - the sailor made us some of the freshest sandwiches for lunch. Sailor's story\
  \ is worth mentioning. Sailors family is of Chilean descent from Miami, FL. He was\
  \ born when his parents were sailing across the south pacific ocean. He lives a\
  \ traditional life - hunting his own meat and eating locally grown produce.   \n\
  \nI made my way to the South Island and spent a couple nights in a small town of\
  \ Collingwood in Golden Bay. Golden Bay's main attraction is the Abel Tasman National\
  \ Park. The absolutely stunning scenery of Tasman Bay en route to Wharariki Beach.\
  \ Wharariki beach is one of the most secluded beaches in New Zealand. It is one\
  \ of a kind, wild (for the surfers) and rugged. I stayed at Zatori Retreat in Golden\
  \ Bay which is run by Tracy and a few others. As soon as I arrived there, they had\
  \ prepared dinner for us. I found myself sitting at the Dinner table eating Indian\
  \ chickpeas curry with rice and raita with a couple other solo travelers from the\
  \ Netherlands and Germany. We spent the night under the stars, sitting outside on\
  \ the Patio - getting to know each other. \n\nMy next destination was Queenstown,\
  \ New Zealand. A touristy town filled with cosmopolitan restaurants and cafes. Surrounded\
  \ by mountains - town offers an long list of things to do. A short drive away from\
  \ Queenstown is Glenorchy and Paradise, one of the filming sites for the LOTR. \n\
  \n\nThis blog post is written to share my experience from my travel to New Zealand\
  \ and is by no means a comprehensive travel guide to the country. Views expressed\
  \ are my own and do not represent views of any other entity."
