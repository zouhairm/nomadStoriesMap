Text: "I sit, dripping, in the front row of the tiny theatre. A few feet away, on\
  \ the stage, is Siphai Thammavong, the storyteller I have come to Laos to work with.\
  \ He knows that I am coming to see his show tonight but not who I am: the two of\
  \ us have never met. I look at the man with whom in the next 14 days I must, somehow,\
  \ create a slick new storytelling show and feel a trickle of tropical rain water\
  \ and sweat run down my back. There is so much I do not know.\n\nThe first time\
  \ I came to Laos, 18 months ago, I took a slow boat up the Mekong and spent an hour\
  \ standing at the stern, singing English folk songs to the sudden, jungle-covered\
  \ outcrops of rock which Lao people call hills. I realised there was no song in\
  \ my repertoire right for that landscape; that my rhythms and rhymes could never\
  \ sing up the turquoise river, the wooden, dirt-floored houses and the water buffalo.\
  \ Like me, my songs were Falang: foreign, western, white. Why should my stories\
  \ be any different?\n\nIn the next few days, as I try to tell my folktales to Siphai\
  \ and encourage him to share Lao tales with me, my tongue feels thick in my mouth\
  \ and my head feels thick in the April heat. On the first day of rehearsals I introduce\
  \ Siphai to my vocal warm up. I sing scales at the walls and rapidly repeat my vowels\
  \ and put my fingers between my teeth to open the back of my throat. Siphai refuses\
  \ to join in but watches, bemused. Shaking out my sticky t-shirt, I ask him what\
  \ he would do in Laos to prepare for a show? He thinks for a moment. \u201CWell,\u201D\
  \ he says. \u201CI would drink some water.\u201D\n\nAt the end of the first week\
  \ we visit a Tai Lue village to collect tales from locals. The village women share\
  \ story after story, each helped along by a generous swig of Lao Lao (rice whisky).\
  \ After lunch, the men join us and beat on upturned plastic buckets while the women\
  \ sing: long wailing notes that fall in and out of tune with one another. Then they\
  \ turn to me. \u201CFalang peng!\u201D they call.\n\nThey want me to sing too, and\
  \ I do: my song as strange to them as theirs was to me. They clap and smile and\
  \ invite me to dance and when we get back to the theatre, Siphai teaches me a song\
  \ of his own: a song from this land, from this very city. I have to write it phonetically\
  \ and practise every day but, at the end of our second week, when we open our show\
  \ to an audience, Siphai and I sing it together: imperfect, in and out of tune with\
  \ one another, catching each other's eyes and laughing. Less slick performance,\
  \ more shared discovery."
