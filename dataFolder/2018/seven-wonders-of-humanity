Text: "Four thousand and five hundred years strong, the Great Pyramids of Giza continue\
  \ to do exactly what they were built to do: last for eternity. As I stood in their\
  \ presence, I noted their ability to empower and command me simultaneously. For\
  \ me, their magnificence went beyond the physical. They symbolized the resilience\
  \ of humankind. While our bodies can't last for thousands of years, our ideas can,\
  \ and ideas have the incredible ability of connecting us with the past and the future\u2026\
  \n\nMy train of thought was abruptly pulled into the present by a gust of sand that\
  \ pierced my eyes. It was a January afternoon in Cairo. I was touring the Giza pyramids\
  \ in a shabby cart driven by an Egyptian man named Kheiry.\n\nKheiry sat on a thin\
  \ metal band at the edge of my seat. Half of his body was hanging outside of the\
  \ cart, with his feet balancing on the bottom ledge. I could barely keep my eyes\
  \ open as the sand continued to blow into my face. I puffed in a moment of irritation.\
  \ I realized, however, that I was blessed with a pair of sunglasses and a comfortable\
  \ seat to sit on. Kheiry, on the other hand, had neither. I asked him, \"Does the\
  \ sand not bother you?\" He was stumped, the question was unexpected. He replied\
  \ that he had no choice but to become immune to it. As an impoverished man, the\
  \ sand was the least of his concerns. Despite all his woes, I was amazed by his\
  \ high spirits. He told me quirky riddles throughout the tour and we laughed until\
  \ it was painful to go on. He then said, \"You haven't laughed in a long time, have\
  \ you?\" Now I was the stumped one. How on earth did he know?! He was absolutely\
  \ right. I was going through the worst anxiety episode that I'd ever endured. I\
  \ left my job, failed to get into law school and had shaky relations with my family,\
  \ friends and even God. An unexplainable leap of faith brought me to Cairo for some\
  \ soul searching. A poor man I barely knew, living on the other side of the world,\
  \ managed to see something in me that people I've known for years weren't able to\
  \ see. Perhaps pain recognizes pain? That day, I did more than just see the pyramids,\
  \ I observed them in the context of their landscape. Yes, they were beautiful, but\
  \ their beauty came in the place they created - a place that allowed two completely\
  \ different people to connect. It was a connection of compassion and humanity. It\
  \ was a reminder that no matter how trying times can be, we are not alone in our\
  \ hardships, and that is often enough to fuel our resilience."
