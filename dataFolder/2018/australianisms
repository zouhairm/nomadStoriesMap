Text: "Australia has an incredibly vicious, frightening, yet desirable reputation\
  \ to the rest of the world. A land of plenty, where life is laidback and the beaches\
  \ glisten. \nNever in my life have I been concerned that I would die by anything\
  \ creepy or crawly. I mean, you know they are around and you are vigilant. But,\
  \ I wouldn\u2019t hide and hibernate if I saw one. \nOk, maybe I would. \nIt wasn\u2019\
  t until I moved to the UK that I truly understood the image that is painted of us\
  \ abroad.\nI began working as a supply teacher.  A supply teacher you ask? What\
  \ an exciting position, what do you do? \nThink along the lines of \u2018glorified\
  \ babysitter\u2019 or \u2018teacher everyone loves to hate.\u2019 For 6 hours of\
  \ each school day, the hormonal teens of the UK were blessed with this Aussie expat.\
  \ Now, supply teaching is not for the faint hearted. Not only do you require a degree\
  \ in education, but you require a psychology, weight-lifting and hand eye co-ordination\
  \ major. \nI soon realised that being Australian could potentially be my golden\
  \ snitch. I discovered that children were so intrigued by my accent and my story,\
  \ that it was hard not to give into their curiosity. \n\"Hey Miss, do you ride kangaroos?\"\
  \ \n\"Do you like always see sharks?\"\n\"Is shrimp nice on a Barbie?\"\n\"So, you\
  \ don\u2019t live in Sydney, does that mean you are in the desert?\"\nAt first,\
  \ I just laughed and said, \"Of course not, don\u2019t be silly.\" I quickly discovered\
  \ that the more moving around I did as a supply teacher, meant that even more students\
  \ were intrigued by my slang vernacular. These students were at my creative disposal\
  \ and once I had realised they were putty in my hand, I let them really have it.\
  \ \n\"Want to learn some Australian guys?\" Classroom erupts with excitement. Now,\
  \ we all know Australian isn\u2019t exactly a language, but 14 year olds certainly\
  \ don\u2019t. \n\"Repeat after me.\"\n(Now, for this to be successful, you as the\
  \ reader need to really give me your best Australian accent and really enunciate\
  \ those vowels. Here we go.)\n\"I went down to Macca\u2019s in my thongs for some\
  \ tucker.\"\nLaughter erupted. I had committed a cardinal sin. I completely forgot\
  \ that thongs were the English equivalent of some revealing negligee. \n\"That means,\
  \ I went down to McDonald\u2019s in my flip flops for some food.\"\n\"Now, your\
  \ homework will be to go home tonight and research Australia and Australian words\
  \ and come back and share with your teacher everything you learnt.\"\nBell rings.\
  \ Who knew that my \u2018Australianisms\u2019 could draw a crowd."
