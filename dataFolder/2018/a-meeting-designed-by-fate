Text: "I've always admired my brother's ability to connect with people. While I'd\
  \ been brooding because of the bumpy, uncomfortable, everlasting bus ride, Paul\
  \ had made friends with everyone - backpackers, locals, lamas - except the driver.\
  \ He would've, if the man hadn't been in a cabin.\n\nLost in doziness, I listened\
  \ to him talk with a bald kiwi man named Mike, who'd just been to Everest Base Camp.\
  \ Mike had been a backpacker for 8 years and thought Into Thin Air by Jon Krakauer\
  \ was the ultimate mountain book. He was going to the Nubra Valley because it what\
  \ his destiny. \"Maybe we'll see the Dalai Lama\", he said. \"People say he's around\
  \ these days\".\n\nIn Ladakh, the Dalai Lama is nowhere and everywhere all at once.\
  \ His wisdom is posted on store fronts, his quiet smile is pictured on leaflets,\
  \ his books are amongst the best sellers of the second-hand bookstores that have\
  \ mushroomed in the dusty streets of Leh.\n\nSince our departure from Amritsar to\
  \ the Himalayas a week before, we'd heard daily rumors about his whereabouts. Like\
  \ a mountain weather bulletin, they changed daily. Some said he was in McLeod Ganj,\
  \ others in Delhi. A few whispered about a secret mission in Tibet and many believed\
  \ the man had been replaced by a Chinese doppelg\xE4nger.\n\nThere were two kinds\
  \ of travelers: those who took the bus to Dharamshala in the hope of finding a path\
  \ to the Holy Man, and the others.\n\nWe'd been looking for mountain tops rather\
  \ than spiritual elevation and didn't enjoy the idea of travelling in an overcrowded\
  \ bus. Still, wherever we went, the Dalai Lama was the main conversation and it'd\
  \ been some time since we last met someone who didn't mention His Holiness.\n\n\
  The bus had passed the snowy Khardungla Top a while ago and was finally on its way\
  \ to reach Diskit, the capital of the Nubra Valley. Outside the window, I looked\
  \ at the desert valley of grey sand and lonely, pinkish mountains. \" At this point,\
  \ I don't even believe the Dalai Lama exists anymore \", I told Paul.\n\nThen, to\
  \ everyone's surprise, the bus went into reverse at full speed and parked in the\
  \ middle of this nowhere place. At a distance came a caravan of many jeeps. Everybody\
  \ got out with great agitation. Lamas chanted, Ladakhis bowed and tourists reached\
  \ for their camera. They didn't have a clue but great pictures could be made.\n\n\
  A car stopped. A window opened and out came a hand and a gentle smile. The Dalai\
  \ Lama waved at us for a second and left, stirring up a cloud of dust. The wind\
  \ swept it along with the remnants of my disbelief."
