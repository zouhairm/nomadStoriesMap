Text: "My name is Afroz and I am from Bangalore ,It was my birthday and as usual I\
  \ travel to some or the other place just to make myself feel super special on this\
  \ day . Dubai, Australia , Thailand were on everybody\u2019s list , I wanted to\
  \ go to a place where not many know about it and so there it was Andaman \u201C\
  The untouched paradise\u201D rightful to its name it was indeed paradise . Feb 1\
  \ 2018 direct flight from Bangalore to Port Blair , I was a little sceptic at first\
  \ on why not many people choosing this place and so was my journey where most of\
  \ the flight seats were empty (thank god there were some beautiful ladies whom I\
  \ could talk all the way to port Blair) and after 2 hrs 45 mins walla! Touchdown!.\
  \ There was a tour guide waiting for me outside the airport, I was all but but tended\
  \ on how the people would be, but to my surprise everybody were so friendly that\
  \ I did not have to spend a penny from my pocket for thy lunch and dinner as to\
  \ the tour guide became a very good friend of mine and so he offered lunch, dinner\
  \ was sorted at a granny\u2019s where she looked at me and said I look like her\
  \ son who was killed in the Tsunami which occurred on that island . Feb 2 , Port\
  \ Blair is full of history and beaches , so first I visited chidiyatapu which translates\
  \ to birds nest . There is a small trek here which I somehow managed after all the\
  \ mumbling but glad did I take that trek , the view from the top was just magical\
  \ . I am standing on a cliff and on all the sides there\u2019s just blue water .\
  \ I wish I could dive but there were rocks at the bottom, I didn\u2019t wanna die\
  \ without completing my tour , then came the great cellular jail which formed a\
  \ great role for India\u2019s independence. Feb 3 - Havelock island , 2 hour ferry\
  \ from port Blair the waters here were completely different , light blue with a\
  \ tinge of green , wind blowing onto my face it was heaven , there was a moment\
  \ where I was all alone on the beach it was like I am the king of the island . Havelock\
  \ is famous for scuba diving , this was my first experience and surely won\u2019\
  t be the last , there is a whole new world down there , serene , calm , magical\
  \ these are the only words which are coming to my mind right now . The experience\
  \ in those waters was just enchanting, it felt like I belong there . Feb 4 Neil\
  \ island , 1hour ferry from havelock this is where I learnt about the Jerwa tribe\
  \ , the original natives of the Andaman. The history explained to me by a traveler\
  \ there was just exemplary. Unfortunately I am out of words , shall complete the\
  \ story if given a chance . Thanks"
