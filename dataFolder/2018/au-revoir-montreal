Text: "It\u2019s still dark as I leave my apartment in Montr\xE9al\u2019s Mile End,\
  \ which is usually a hub of energy. On any given day, you can smell honey-boiled\
  \ bagels wafting down Rue St-Viateur, as hipsters peruse vintage stores and Jewish\
  \ people rush past in on their way to synagogue. But not today. Today everything\
  \ seems frozen, as though the whole city is hibernating and completely nonchalant\
  \ to the fact that I am saying goodbye to it.\n\nIn order to get out of my apartment,\
  \ I have to descend the winding staircase of death, that wraps around the building\
  \ like ribbon, with a humongous suitcase containing my life possessions. I decide\
  \ that my best bet is to propel the suitcase through the air and let it crash down\
  \ onto the pavement below. I then walk down the stairs whilst death-gripping the\
  \ icy railing with both hands, as a tiny stumble could send me fatally bouncing\
  \ down like a slinky. Once safely on the pavement with my bag, I say a quick and\
  \ painful goodbye to my loved ones as the Uber has already arrived. With a scrape\
  \ and thud, my suitcase is thrown into the trunk of the car and before I have time\
  \ to process my emotions - we are on the move.\n\nUpon arriving in Montr\xE9al over\
  \ a year ago, I had agreed to share a cab from the airport with a guy called Justin,\
  \ who was re-visiting after some time away. As we sped down the freeway toward Montr\xE9\
  al\u2019s centre-ville, Justin asked how long I planned on staying for.\n\n\u201C\
  Oh, only two months,\u201D I replied.\n\n\u201CCareful,\u201D he responded with\
  \ a smirk, \u201CI only intended on visiting for a week but I stayed for a year.\u201D\
  \n\nMany people in Montr\xE9al will tell a similar story about why they never left.\
  \ It seems that Montr\xE9al has a way of anchoring itself in the hearts of those\
  \ who are dead-set on their plans. Just when you think it\u2019s time to leave,\
  \ the city finds ways to entice you to stay; with its plethora of summer and winter\
  \ festivals, maple-coloured autumns and contagious bohemian vibe. Before you know\
  \ it, you\u2019ll be enrolled in French classes and subletting an apartment.\n\n\
  As the Uber skids away on the black-ice encrusted road, I watch as the staircases\
  \ and frosted fir trees disappear into the background. Before we\u2019re even on\
  \ the freeway, the familiar sights of a city, that I unintentionally fell in love\
  \ with, begin to zoom past at warp-speed until they become a blur of white and fade\
  \ away.\n\n\u201CWhere are you going?\u201D The Uber driver asks me in his thick\
  \ Quebecois accent.\n\n\u201CI\u2019m going home,\u201D I reply.\n\nBut it feels\
  \ like I\u2019m leaving it behind."
