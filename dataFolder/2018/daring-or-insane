Text: "Everyone needs a story to turn to when silence falls, preferably one that leaves\
  \ the group wondering if you\u2019re daring or insane. Mine begins with a search\
  \ for pie, ends with a crying Japanese family and undoubtedly falls under the latter.\n\
  It was a January evening after a bullet-train from Tokyo to Hakuba, a fairy-land\
  \ where sparkling icicles hung from rafters and the fluffiest snow danced on the\
  \ breeze, that we began our pursuit of dinner. Adventurously, we had booked a ryokan\
  \ next to the ski slopes; however, snow-capped mountains forfeited proximity to\
  \ restaurants.\n\nAs we wandered, fighting the language barrier for recommendations,\
  \ we caught wind of a place some kilometres away. Googling it, I found a raving\
  \ review, crowned with a photo of the most delectable blueberry pie, and set my\
  \ heart on it despite the distance. Serendipity struck: a knight in silver Volvo\
  \ pulled up, armed with a GPS and wide smile.\nThe gentleman insisted the restaurant\
  \ was on his way and chatted in broken English as he drove through the worsening\
  \ snowfall. We incessantly thanked our hero, especially when he revealed he was,\
  \ in fact, driving the opposite direction when he pulled over. He is only one example\
  \ of the generosity we received; I feel confident saying I have yet to meet locals\
  \ as welcoming as those in Japan.\nOnce satiated, we stepped outside... the light\
  \ snowfall had evolved into a monstrous blizzard. I was overwhelmed by screaming\
  \ wind and bright white snow soaking through my boots. Our spontaneity had left\
  \ us with two options: attempt to organise a taxi or hike back. The distance was\
  \ arduous without snow, but I foolishly decided to exaggerate the closeness and\
  \ insist we can walk following google maps. My plan failed when my phone died; I\
  \ had exhausted the battery taking photos of pie.\n\nWhat felt like eons later,\
  \ completely covered in snow and my hair frozen, I stumbled through our door and\
  \ collapsed in disbelief; we had succeeded in making it back and eluding frostbite.\
  \ My celebration stopped abruptly when I looked up and met the eyes of the Japanese\
  \ family running the inn. They were chatting animatedly as we walked in, and now\
  \ stared at us with wide eyes and gaping mouths.\nI can\u2019t imagine how we must\u2019\
  ve looked coming in from the snow, but it was apparently ridiculous enough to warrant\
  \ \u2018bawl your eyes\u2019 laughter, repeating every time we encountered them\
  \ onwards. I like to think they, too, tell a story of the Australians insane enough\
  \ to hike through a blizzard for pie."
