Text: "During last Spring, my partner and I decided on a weekend in Geneva, choosing\
  \ to spend our first afternoon in the lake. As we walked towards the paid section\
  \ around the lake, we saw the snow capped Swiss Alps, but thought nothing of it.\
  \ We got undressed and I handed my partner my locker key to place in his pocket.\
  \ He had developed a theory that the keys would float. He decided to test his theory,\
  \ by throwing them into the 2m deep lake. The water was so beautifully clear that\
  \ we watched them sink and rest on the sand at the bottom. He knew he was in the\
  \ wrong and jumped in. As he emerged, he yelled out, apparently feeling his balls\
  \ inside himself. Standing on the pontoon absolutely hysterical, I watched him struggle\
  \ to retrieve the keys. I told him that that the water couldn\u2019t be that cold.\
  \ I jumped in and realised my mistake. I told him I couldn\u2019t find the keys\
  \ any more and began stressing out, and that was when my partner decided to tell\
  \ me that he had already found and pocketed them. This man is somehow now my fianc\xE9\
  . The scenery was beautiful and the water became warmer over time. When we\u2019\
  d decided to get out, we went our separate ways to the change rooms. There was a\
  \ naked older lady, I didn\u2019t think much of it until she asked my to scrub her\
  \ back. She was so authoritative with her French accent that I felt like I had no\
  \ choice but to do it. As I was scrubbing, she yelled, \u201Charder!\u201D three\
  \ times. Her back was bright red by the time I had finished. That\u2019s when she\
  \ turned to me and asked, \u201Cnow you?\u201D I said no, and ran out of the shower,\
  \ dressing as fast as I could. To combat that ordeal, my partner and I went for\
  \ fondue. We got many strange looks in the caf\xE9 type thing we\u2019d found when\
  \ we\u2019d asked about it. After about 10 minutes of broken English and French,\
  \ we sat down and were presented with a bottle of wine. In French, my partner asked,\
  \ \u201Cwhat is it?\u201D the server replied, \u201Cwine\u201D, and my partner asked,\
  \ \u201Cwhat is it?\u201D, this continues for a few minutes until the server looks\
  \ helplessly at me and I tell her we\u2019ll take two glasses. When she walks off,\
  \ I ask my partner what on earth he was trying to say to her. He said, \u201CI asked\
  \ her how much, I don\u2019t know why she kept saying wine.\u201D I then informed\
  \ him what he was saying and he turned as red as the naked lady\u2019s back. After\
  \ our fondue and leaving a tip for our ignorance, we headed out to bar. Our searches\
  \ led us to somewhere on the back streets, out of the way. Turns out it was a prostitute\
  \ bar."
