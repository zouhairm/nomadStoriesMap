Text: "\u201CBonjour!\u201D He calls out in a semi-convincing Quebecois accent. I\u2019\
  m as Ontarian as it gets but I appreciate his sentiment; I\u2019ve been trekking\
  \ through India for over a month now and Canada feels like a world away. \n\nThe\
  \ sights and sounds of Varanasi\u2014one of India\u2019s holiest cities--are sensational,\
  \ but I\u2019m sorely missing the creature comforts of home \u2013 toilet seats,\
  \ air conditioning, and good old Tim Horton\u2019s, to name a few. \n\nI squeeze\
  \ through the throng of locals hurrying towards the temple down the twisted, cobblestone\
  \ lane. I launch myself onto Vishnu\u2019s stoop where he stands, waist deep, in\
  \ red, metal boxes.\n\nVishnu\u2019s tea emporium. The air is sweet and heavy -\
  \ a rarity when livestock roam freely through the city. The floor is covered in\
  \ glittery cushions and pinned to the wall is a well-loved guide on how to make\
  \ the best masala chai in the world. I\u2019m intrigued. \n\nNeither the tea nor\
  \ Vishnu disappoint \u2013 he\u2019s so open and excited about life that it\u2019\
  s hard to remember what apathy feels like. Despite the oppressive humidity, this\
  \ steaming cup of chai and his equally warm demeanor are exactly what I need.\n\n\
  By fate or chance, we run into each other many times. Without fail, Vishnu drops\
  \ what he\u2019s doing to show me his favourite hideaways. I learn that he wears\
  \ many hats in the community--tour guide, mentor, and family bread-winner. \n\n\
  We row a boat on the Ganges river to watch the funeral pyres burn on the riverbank.\
  \ I\u2019m disturbed by the floating clouds of ash and the huge cockroaches scuttling\
  \ beneath my feet. \n\nYet, the sheer joy on Vishnu\u2019s face dissolves at once\
  \ my discomfort and challenges my atheistic upbringing. He explains how those cremated\
  \ on the Ganges will bypass the cycle of reincarnation to reach moksha, perfect\
  \ peace and happiness. \n\nOn my last night, Vishnu shares his final pearl of wisdom.\
  \ The way to a woman\u2019s heart, he insists, is through Papdi Chaat \u2013 a heaping\
  \ plate of fried wafers, smothered in yogurt and tamarind sauce. As I devour my\
  \ second helping, I realize he is not wrong.\n\nWhen it\u2019s time to leave, we\
  \ buy my ticket and he cheerily tosses me the rupees he earned as commission for\
  \ my purchase. He promises that if I come back to visit, he\u2019ll buy me a striking\
  \ blue sari. I believe him.\n\nMy train chugs out of the station and I feel a familiar\
  \ ache in my belly. It\u2019s a funny thing to be so homesick, not for my beautiful\
  \ country, but for a person I met mere days ago."
