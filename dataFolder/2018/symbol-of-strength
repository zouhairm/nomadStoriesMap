Text: "\u201CYou are on your own?\u201D Blatantly questioned my seatmate.\n\nMy forehead\
  \ began to feel a tickle from the beads of perspiration that were starting to form.\
  \   The uneasiness of travelling alone causes one to rehearse reasons for embarking\
  \ on a solo adventure; just in case someone asks.  And I was prepared.  \n\n\u201C\
  Yes!  I\u2019m here for bird photography with a guide.\u201D I tried to relay with\
  \ confidence.\n\n\u201COh, okay.  That\u2019s cool.\u201D Was the response that\
  \ lowered her raised eyebrow.\n\nAs an independent parent I had ventured to many\
  \ places with my, now, grown son.  I often reflect upon the inner momentum I needed\
  \ to do so; the sense of freedom and accomplishment that energized me to persevere.\n\
  \nArrival at the hotel was swift and soon enough I made my way to\u2014a surprise\u2014\
  oceanfront room.  I never splurge on my travel accommodations so this was a pleasant\
  \ upgrade.  After pulling back the gauzy pink and green curtains, I should have\
  \ been thrilled with the view.  But my eyes were drawn to the angled stumps\u2014\
  palm tree stumps and the browned, shriveled fronds scattered where lush green vines\
  \ should have been flourishing.  Furthermore, I could hear hammering plus the zing\
  \ of electric saws nearby.  \n\nThe hurricanes!  Much of the Caribbean had been\
  \ lashed by several severe storms in the Fall of 2017 and the devastation was unexpected\
  \ in normally pristine Cayo Coco.  Buildings were smashed by 200 KM+ winds; towering\
  \ trees were ripped out by their wide-reaching roots.  And, I later learned that\
  \ many of the birds had perished too, which of course was heartbreaking.\n\nIt was\
  \ now nearing noon and I was ready for lunch.  Before entering the buffet restaurant,\
  \ I glimpsed a bright white object on the side rail.  It was an elegant bird; a\
  \ Great Egret.  My lucky day!  And, I always have a camera handy.  I slowly walked\
  \ up to the bird and took several photos.  The Egret boldly made eye contact but\
  \ was not fussed with my presence.  He stood tall and majestic. \n\nWhen I went\
  \ inside, a server, Fidel (yes, Fidel) approached me to say that the Egret was \u2018\
  el pajaro maravilla\u2019 (his words\u2014a wonder bird).  This bird was the only\
  \ survivor of his species in the area after the horrors of Irma, Maria and Harvey.\
  \  I thought, \u201CWhat a stunning example of endurance for the Cuban people as\
  \ they laboriously rebuild their businesses and homes\u201D.  A real symbol of strength.\
  \  \n\nWith my head held high, I embraced that moment of dining alone in all of\
  \ its awkwardness and felt a flicker of pride about this liberating journey."
