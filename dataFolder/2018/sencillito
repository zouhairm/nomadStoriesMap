Text: "Argentina, the place of wine, meat and mate. What a life\n\nLet me tell you\
  \ the story i wrote in Argentina. \nFirst I arrive in Buenos Aires, there was a\
  \ lot of beautiful people, with a facial expression of disgusting odor. Maybe I\
  \ need to take a bath.\n\nThen enter in a restaurant's name Cogullo: El lugar de\
  \ la parrilla. A perfect place, wood table, wood chair, wood door, wood world. Smoking\
  \ aroma, and a citric perfume.\nSo I sit in the table hopping to see an expensive\
  \ men\xFA, but it wasn't. I ordered a picanha, a local beer and something spicy\
  \ because... Mexican.\n\nThey arrive with a special cut, delicious, a gold shining\
  \ meat with some herbs in top. But the spicy salsa was chimichurri with jalape\xF1\
  o, what is this I ask, they told me is part of the Mexican menu. I feel disgusted\
  \ so i drank my beer eat my cut and leave the place.\n\nNear theres whas a bar with\
  \ some River\xB4s inchas so i entered and start the Argentine\xB4s party. In the\
  \ middle of goals, cheers and motherfuckerscreams was a beautiful lady, with a short\
  \ blue hair, big round eyes, and a little mouth. So shy, in the middle in the crowd\
  \ she shine.\n\nSo."
