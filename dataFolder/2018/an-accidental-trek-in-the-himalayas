Text: "The sunlight was hot on my back and the water cold as it fell from a pump embedded\
  \ on the side of the hill, seeming very much a part of the terrain as it sourced\
  \ crystal liquid from the nearby stream. I was bathing out in the open- there was\
  \ not a human in sight and the town of Manali lay in a patchwork of sunny colours\
  \ before me. There was silence. This was not what I expected when I set out for\
  \ this popular Himalayan town in May, 2017.\nManali in summers is a sight to behold.\
  \ Its market is buried in bargains over woollen caps and shawls, earthy sandalwood\
  \ and saffron, and fresh plums, peaches and oranges. I wandered along River Beas\
  \ and had breakfast at the German Bakery which according to local stories, was established\
  \ in the 1960s by a migrant German couple.\nThe day tumbled down a different route\
  \ when I realised that my hastily booked AirBnB accommodation was 8 miles away from\
  \ the town, in the village of Hamta. I embarked on a trek that I had unwittingly\
  \ planned. The trail crossed a local school with grey walls painted all over with\
  \ animal figures, ringing with echoes of \u201CHumpty Dumpty sat on a wall\u201D\
  . Children from surrounding villages walk at least 6 miles daily to attend classes\
  \ here in summers. I was soon joined by an old woman who had a bag strapped around\
  \ her back and head. She borrowed a cigarette from me and, to my chagrin, paced\
  \ easily while I struggled. Her daughter-in-law, she declared proudly, was the only\
  \ paediatrician in the area- a fact that would still shock modern Indians. Helping\
  \ me hitch a ride to Hamta, she claimed that it was a customary means of travel\
  \ for the locals.\nMy host, Dolma, welcomed me with hot chai, prepared with ginger,\
  \ pepper and jaggery and a plate of rajma-chawal, a local dish made of red kidney\
  \ beans and steamed rice. She routinely used wild herbs to make chutneys and teas\
  \ and was wildly amused at the notion of boxed \u201Corganic\u201D foodstuffs. As\
  \ Dolma led me to the shack, I learnt that it was previously taken by a young Australian\
  \ man who stayed for six months, doing nothing at all, to her immense confusion.\n\
  That night, I drank lugdi, a traditional Himalayan rice beer made with fermented\
  \ rice and ganja and thought about the small school and Dolma who was married at\
  \ seven and widowed at seventeen and the old woman who never gave me her name. I\
  \ wondered about the Australian man and felt kinship with him as I gazed at the\
  \ deep black sky and the town-light stars beneath it and did absolutely nothing.\n\
  Manali was far away."
