Text: "Quickly, picture Morocco! What do you see? If you\u2019ve already been there\
  \ then you\u2019ll already know what I\u2019m getting at, but if you haven\u2019\
  t, I bet you\u2019re picturing something similar to what I once imagined; endless\
  \ sand, camels, camels and more camels, and the sound of songful worship booming\
  \ from the many beautiful mosques dotted throughout the Aladdin-esque cities of\
  \ Morocco. \n\nWe were looking forward to experiencing a culture different to our\
  \ pour-over-coffee-veggie-eating-western-hipster lifestyle that we\u2019d all fallen\
  \ victim of, and we wanted to experience something new, yet somewhat predictable.\
  \ This all changed when we met Abdul\u2026\n\nAbdul, whose full name is Essaleh\
  \ Abdella Amanar, was our driver for the last leg of our journey across Morocco.\
  \ We\u2019d landed in Essaouira, a fishing town on the west coast, three days ago\
  \ from Luton airport and were about to start our next leg of the adventure. We\u2019\
  d chilled out in Essaouira, enjoying its boho/reggae vibe and fresh fish tagines,\
  \ and then stopped overnight in Marrakech before our three day journey into the\
  \ desert. \n\nWe\u2019d booked our desert excursion through the travel company,\
  \ So Morocco, who were able to arrange our transport, food and accomodation for\
  \ the three day adventure; sorted! They sent Abdul to pick us up from our hotel.\
  \ The short, slender Berber man greeted us with an ear-to-ear smile and kindly took\
  \ our luggage into our mobile home - a silver Renault people carrier - for the next\
  \ three days.\n\nWe set off early through the bustling streets of Marrakech. A silver\
  \ morning mist had shrouded the walls of the Medina, making the souks and market\
  \ stalls seem like an Arabian painting. Abdul was an unending fountain of knowledge,\
  \ telling us the many names of the places we saw and how the name of Marrakech is\
  \ not Arabic, it's the French spelling for the Berber name, Marrakec. \n\nHe came\
  \ from a Berber village in the Atlas mountains - home to the highest mountain in\
  \ North Africa, Tubkal. \u201CWe Berbers are not Arabic. We come from an ancient\
  \ civilisation,\u201D he explained, \u201C and we\u2019ve been in North Africa since\
  \ at least 10,000 BC.\u201D We were so blessed to have him as our guide. We learnt\
  \ that Berber women are the guiding force of their culture, and in ancient times\
  \ the people were led into battle by their warrior queens - my wife seemed particularly\
  \ pleased by that!\n\nBecause of Abdul, Morocco was becoming more beautiful than\
  \ I had ever realised. It just had to be seen through his Berber eyes. Thank you\
  \ Abdul - tanemmirt."
