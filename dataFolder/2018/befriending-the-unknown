Text: "When I heard a sheep\u2019s bleat with no other living being in sight, my mountain\
  \ solitude stared me right in the face. It had been a grueling several hours of\
  \ uphill trekking. Roy\u2019s Peak in Wanaka, New Zealand, was a challenging match\
  \ for my novice hiking skills.\n\nThe arid ground decorated me in dried dirt. Battle\
  \ scars, I thought, as I coerced myself to climb another section of the sequestered\
  \ switchback trail. If nature had a fashion show, I would probably win. For now,\
  \ the quiet mountainside was the only witness to my soil-clad aesthetic.\n\nAs I\
  \ sat down for a haphazardly crafted tomato sandwich, suppressed doubts scratched\
  \ to the surface. It\u2019s getting late. I\u2019m a solo climber. Is this safe?\
  \ Is it best to turn back? I could fall and no one would be there to help. ARE THERE\
  \ SNAKES HERE?! The list went on, growing in absurdity, as usual. \n\nWorries bullied\
  \ my confidence, trying to discredit the progress I already befriended. My heart\
  \ raced from physical exertion paired with brewing anxiety. The water of Glendhu\
  \ Bay was dancing in the distance, a product of Wanaka\u2019s summer sky. The sheep\
  \ had multiplied, oblivious to my agitation, staring on in tranquility. \n\nSuddenly,\
  \ the silence broke. \n\n\u201CThis goes on FOREVER!\u201D An honest voice emerged.\
  \ \u201COh hey!\u201D I blurted out in surprise. After hours of not seeing humans,\
  \ my responses bubbled up fast. The voice belonged to Craig from Ireland, accompanied\
  \ by Nick from Germany. We compared mountain notes and clicked instantly. The only\
  \ way to go was up.\n\nWe spoke of our countries, moving across the world, and making\
  \ connections with others. We agreed that it was humorously unexpected to find great\
  \ friends on the sides of mountains. \n\n\u201CNick got to listen to me complain\
  \ the whole way up\u201D, Craig said facetiously.\n\n\u201CAt least you had company!\
  \ I was close to turning back\u201D, I eventually admitted, a hint of shame attached\
  \ to my words. I laughed, musing that they were my guardian mountain angels who\
  \ appeared to help me finish the trek.\n\n\u201CMaybe we are!\u201D Nick offered,\
  \ grinning.\n\nThe earthy smell of the tussock grasslands intensified while the\
  \ sheep bleats faded into the distance. \n\nThe dusty path fanned out as we neared\
  \ the top, inviting us to marvel at the sharp ridges and 360-degree views of the\
  \ glittering bay below. The winds increased to lofty gusts, testing our stability.\n\
  \nAfter seeing the top, I can attest: there aren\u2019t any snakes on Mount Roy,\
  \ but you might encounter a couple mountain guardian angels if you\u2019re as lucky\
  \ as myself."
