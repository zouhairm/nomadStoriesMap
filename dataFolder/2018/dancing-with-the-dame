Text: "My compatriots must have given her good money for the bottle, because she swiftly\
  \ closed the back-alley closet and invited us inside. Two pock-marked men remained\
  \ on the sidewalk, stoic next to her flashing stereo. It was the size of a mini-fridge\
  \ and the sole activity on the dark street. We were in Celia Cruz\u2019s old neighborhood,\
  \ Havana, Cuba. Inside, I sat on a worn chair facing a glossy, ornately carved bar,\
  \ lined with liquor bottles and fake flowers. A strange purple glow lit the room,\
  \ and the music from the sidewalk filled it. This was a room for entertaining.\n\
  \nThe elderly woman, dressed in black and adorned with beads, pulled out mismatched\
  \ glassware. Dark wine flowed, and, as we clinked glasses with our host, I noticed\
  \ the Santaria shine in the corner -- custom of a uniquely Caribbean religion. Earlier\
  \ that day, I had learned of a women who had been fired from her job in the 1970\u2019\
  s, when it was discovered she had a shine in her home. \n\nWithin minutes, the wine\
  \ and music began to blend in a primal away, and I could no longer sit. Suddenly,\
  \ we were three American women, dancing in this home-turned-nightclub. Our stoic\
  \ host stood nearby, in the doorway, and we indicated for her to join us. As if\
  \ this is what she had been waiting for, she smiled and approached. Joining hands,\
  \ we danced the circles that women of all cultures know. It was hips, swirls, and\
  \ shoulders and then eventually sweat, mingled with the smell of wine. The matron\u2019\
  s scarf fell off her head, and a youthfulness came over her deeply-lined face. \n\
  \nHer men, who had been observing through the open door and window, abandoned their\
  \ post and came to dance with us. They smiled for the first time, and we were no\
  \ longer suspects, nor Americans. A tray of ham cubes came out, and we were offered\
  \ to partake. A vegetarian, I made a ten-year exception and swallowed the perspiring\
  \ meat, thanking them with one of the few words I knew in Spanish. Gracias.\n\n\
  Two hours later, bottles empty, energy depleted, and smiles genuine, we thank our\
  \ hosts and prepare to wind our way back home, through empty streets and desolate\
  \ cement buildings. Looking with kindness into each other\u2019s eyes, there are\
  \ hugs and kisses. The woman, worn out but smiling, turns to speak to her men. They\
  \ look at us in unison, and she speaks with gravity.  \n\n\u201CYou are family now.\
  \ Whatever you want, just let us know. We want to be your protectors.\u201D \n\n\
  We nod and smile.\n\n\u201CYou understand? Whatever you need, you call us.\u201D\
  \ \n\nAnd we understood."
