Text: "My head splits and I\u2019m freezing in this heated room. I jump out of bed.\
  \ Where am I?\n4 am.  Pulling aside the thick curtain in my match box hotel room,\
  \ I narrow my eyes and try and see. Something is falling from the sky and I can\
  \ see it in the beam of the halogen lit outside the building across. I double check\
  \ by tracing the beams of the headlights of cars. Is it drizzling? But there\u2019\
  s no sound. The ground is dusted with powdered sugar. Is this what snow is?\n\n\
  I run a hot shower and hurry to get ready. The room is boiling as I dress. I\u2019\
  ll never understand how these heated rooms work. Warm and sweaty, I take on a thin\
  \ jacket and step outside. It\u2019s so quiet. Like when it rains, except there\
  \ is no sound. And no-one is running for shelter. I try and catch the little bits,\
  \ and look to understand the form. Is each one really different? And they melt so\
  \ fast! I\u2019m looking at the sky, wondering if it is the same as when it rains\
  \ back home.\n\nMy ears ring in the silence. My skin starts to burn. Germany is\
  \ very far from India. I run in to get a coat. The snow falls on my face as I look\
  \ up, and I can\u2019t help but think of when it rains back home, and the beauty\
  \ it brings along with it. The landscapes all turn green, and the mud becomes muddier.\
  \ Lovers stroll under umbrellas, and friends drive their motorbikes into the hills.\
  \ Pune transforms with rain.\nHamburg transforms. The trees turned grey, blending\
  \ into the buildings. This is a palette that I haven\u2019t seen in nature before.\
  \ There are no lovers on the streets, everyone is sitting inside the overcrowded\
  \ bars in Sternschanze, sharing each other\u2019s warmth. I miss being home. \n\
  The sun here is a cool white presence, different from the yellow bulb that lights\
  \ up my house. The snow continues to fall on me as my mind flies back and forth\
  \ across the continents. It is peaceful here. I could sit right here and for hours\
  \ no one would know, and no passer-by would wonder. My ears begin to sleep and my\
  \ nose turns red. Do they have gloves for their noses here, or do their noses just\
  \ grow stronger? I have so many questions about this place.\n\nThere\u2019s no one\
  \ dancing in the snow, when so many dance in the rain. There is excitement in the\
  \ warm bars, and murmuring behind the double paneled windows. There\u2019s music,\
  \ there\u2019s food and a community where everyone is free to be, and belongs. I\
  \ settle at a window, and outside, the warm yellow lights, begin to remind me of\
  \ the sun in my garden. Smiles and glasses of wine, drive away the cold. I\u2019\
  m home."
