Text: "As our car bounced over the dusty rutted road, startled nilgai antelope took\
  \ flight from behind banana plant thickets. Newspapers call Uttar Pradesh India\u2019\
  s heartland.  Here mustachioed men wear big turbans and women pull their saris low\
  \ to veil their faces. Raised in metropolitan Kolkata, I felt a fish out of water\
  \ as I covered elections here. My local driver, Salim, grumbled at the potholes.\n\
  \n\u201CIt\u2019s OK,\u201D I said. \u201CTonight we can have beers and relax\u201D\
  . I thought warm kebabs and cold beer could cut through class divides.\n\nSalim\
  \ replied flatly \u201CI\u2019m a good Muslim, sir. I don\u2019t drink. I don\u2019\
  t like to drive anyone who has been drinking.\u201D He also would not eat anywhere\
  \ non-halal. We needed to find a vegetarian place. So much for kebabs.\n\nSultanpur,\
  \ the nearest town, bustled with motorcycles and donkeys. My hotel was Garden View\
  \ but the only garden on view was a strip of wilting lawn. And I, a liberal Hindu,\
  \ was trapped there with a conservative Muslim, years my junior. He shared fevered\
  \ stories about Hindu conspiracies. In rallies we met his mirror image \u2013 Hindus\
  \ waving saffron flags, bristling with anti-Muslim paranoia. The heartland felt\
  \ like badlands.\n\nBut slowly Salim and I bonded over milky tea and roadside lunches.\
  \ \u201CCome back again,\u201D he said. \u201CI\u2019ll have a friend take you to\
  \ bars\u201D.  I insisted I was fine though I was looking forward to a beer after\
  \ we parted ways.\n\nOn our last day he was pensive.  \u201CSir\u201D, he said abruptly,\
  \ \u201CDo you have a girlfriend\u201D? No I said shortly. \n\nI asked if he did.\
  \ With one hand on the steering-wheel he told me a Bollywood-worthy story. He had\
  \ met the love of his life in Koran class. They had done it all, he said, from \u201C\
  oral\u201D to \u201Cfull everything\u201D. When her rich family started looking\
  \ for a husband he didn\u2019t know what to do. Her brothers, he shrugged, had \u201C\
  done a few murders\u201D. He feared a Romeo-Juliet bloodbath. He gave her a silver\
  \ anklet, junked his MBA, and became a driver to get away from it all, he said,\
  \ his eyes moist. \n\nI felt I had to match up to the rawness of the moment. \u201C\
  Salim,\u201D I said hesitantly. \u201CI have no girlfriend. But I have a boyfriend.\u201D\
  \n\n\u201CA man?\u201D He stared at me. I was tenser than I had been at those rallies.\n\
  \nI stared out of the window at overloaded trucks and sugarcane fields. Then Salim\
  \ shook his head. \u201CChalo, at least you have someone in your life.\u201D He\
  \ sighed. \u201CYou don\u2019t hurt anybody by loving someone, no? Why don\u2019\
  t they just leave us alone?\u201D\n\nI nodded silently while the heartland of India\
  \ rushed past us."
