Text: "It was a cold winter Sunday, I was walking through the quiet, vast fields that\
  \ stood still towards the purple sky of the twilight. I was surrounded by the comforting\
  \ beauty of my home town and a lot of different thoughts were running fast in my\
  \ mind.\n\nAt that time, my life was smooth, maybe slow, I was driven by an empty\
  \ force. Reflecting, observing, feeling that something was wrong pushed me somehow\
  \ to take action. The peaceful environment around my place didn\u2019t fit with\
  \ the restless nature of my inner world. It was at that point, when I felt the space,\
  \ the strength and bravery to stretch the borders of my comfort zone, that I decided\
  \ to leave everything behind and fly somewhere far enough.\n\nAs in my childhood\
  \ dreams, I ran far north, to the borders of the world, where the sun is never sleeping\
  \ and the night is never ending. I decided to stay for a few months in the land\
  \ of extremes, where you can stand at the top of a cliff, just go towards the edge\
  \ and feel at the end of the world, overwhelmed by the majestic beauty of the fjords.\n\
  \nAs soon as I arrived, contrasting feelings started to weigh on me like a huge\
  \ burden on my shoulders. The excitement, the happiness and sense of freedom due\
  \ to the new experience were fighting with the sense of loneliness and fear. I needed\
  \ to try to turn these heavy sensations into motivation and inspiration to discover.\
  \ So many new, unexpected things were surrounding me. The impressive landscapes,\
  \ where mountains and sea were struggling for their space; the cold smile of people\
  \ speaking an obscure, nasal language; their unexpectedly welcoming attitude and\
  \ calm lifestyle; the yellow lights, in the streets and the houses; the emerald\
  \ light popping out in the sky during cold nights, when you are distracted; the\
  \ delicate, elegant snowflakes falling silently all around you; the sweet scent\
  \ of waffles and cinnamon; the cheerful laughter of many young adventurers with\
  \ different stories behind.\n\nI had always been a shy, fearful person, who was\
  \ sometimes leaving herself behind. In that far, harsh land I learned to look at\
  \ things in a new way, with the curiosity of a child and the wisdom of an adult.\
  \ I realized how much that beautiful journey reflected a hidden path, visible only\
  \ to my own eyes."
