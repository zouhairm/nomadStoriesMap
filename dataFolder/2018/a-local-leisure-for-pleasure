Text: "With the summer season glistening it teeth from the corner of the British climes,\
  \ many will be combing different travel guides for various destinations.\nFrom the\
  \ north of John O' Groat to the south of Land's End, I will say look and search\
  \ no further than the radius of the M-25.\n\nAre you looking for a holiday haven\
  \ or just a place to wine and dine with your family, a recreational ground or a\
  \ relaxation field that would sooth your mind, body and soul? From the south of\
  \ London to the Midlands. How about that. I chose this destination due to its serenity,\
  \ tranquillity and vast lan\nMeandering through the city of London while catching\
  \ glances and visibility of landmarks such as the Battersea Power Station, Dogs\
  \ Hom\n\nI got off on reachin a bit by passing through the nooks and crannies of\
  \ alleys and greenly thick forest to final Premier Inn hoteliers located in the\
  \ east of Milton Keynes. With its cool, smooth and calm environs, no wonder some\
  \ do not only see it as a haven, but as a wonderful and naturally great habitat\
  \ for a holiday resort.\n\nThe place has so much to offer given the amount of adventurous\
  \ sites it boast of, such as the jungle park for children, the water sports avenue,\
  \ a site for camping and some Greenfields. Through my enquiries and discoveries,\
  \ I realised Willen Lake is divided into two parts. The north and the south.\n\n\
  The north possess the spiritual connotation of the resort, while the south encapsulates\
  \ the luxury embodiment of holiday essentials. \n\nThe main block housing the hotel\
  \ is situated right opposite the Lake front, where ducks and their ducklings swan\
  \ around the threshold of the lake, making them fun to watch.\n\nSeparated into\
  \ three blocks of apartment, the middle block of the hotel offers a commanding view\
  \ of the water-world of the vicinity.\nOut of the numerous recreational amenities\
  \ it boasts of, the easiest one to me, is the Pedalo (a paddling boat) because one\
  \ does not need any lessons to ride.\n\nAlthough the weather was not that great,\
  \ I still braved it by hopping onto one which cost me \xA315.00, and for an adrenalin-sapping\
  \ experience, I tried the Arial Extreme.\n\nThe Arial Extreme is an adventure jungle\
  \ full of entangled ropes hanging from mid-air on a walk-way. Even though I was\
  \ well strapped and fastened, I was still scared to even breathe.\n\nAnother essential\
  \ place of interest I figured out, was a tree high up in the Green-fields with letters\
  \ and notes hanging from its branches. \n\nTry to pay them a visit once.\n\n\n\n\
  \n\n\n\n\n."
