Text: "I met the \"Sunshine State\", Fortaleza as it is known. Six months ago I was\
  \ able to attend a congress on Social Communication that took place there. Many\
  \ people talked about the state's high crime rate, and I was always very apprehensive\
  \ about it.\n  As soon as I arrived I found a state totally different from what\
  \ was described in television news, not that what was shown was not true but that\
  \ it was not the absolute truth.\n  The state shines in an unbelievable way, its\
  \ beaches and the hospitality of its people has conquered me. The Dragon of the\
  \ Sea is a major tourist center and the local market has shown how so many pluralities\
  \ of content can be found in Northeastern culture.\n  In the Dragon of the Sea we\
  \ can find cinema, museum, street parties, show houses, besides being a totally\
  \ cozy place for all the old bands. The market sells spices, cakes, typical foods\
  \ from Fortaleza and northeast, as well as drinks and clothing, a great place to\
  \ find utensils to carry as souvenirs.\n  Besides people looking for a healthier\
  \ life, I could see people walking, cycling and practicing physical exercise, especially\
  \ on the edge of Iracema beach.\n  Iracema beach, besides a typical fair, on its\
  \ edge we can find several statues and monuments that represent the Sun State. In\
  \ addition to two wooden bridges that are great for taking pictures.\n  On the nearby\
  \ beach, which is called \"Crush Beach\", there are always luis and cantorias of\
  \ local artists, as well as stand-up performances by comedians and northeastern\
  \ personalities.\n  Without a doubt, Fortaleza is the birthplace of a rich and innovative\
  \ tourism that seeks in its local culture a prominent status in the northeast, just\
  \ as the other Brazilian capitals pass for an increasing crime rate, but the beauty\
  \ of the State of Light can not be erased by something of this magnitude.\n  Since\
  \ only changing the cultural context and bringing new contrasts to the state, it\
  \ is possible to reduce this index. The more local tourism the more jobs will be\
  \ generated and consequently fewer people will opt for the world of crime."
