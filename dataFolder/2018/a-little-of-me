Text: "It never goes over 35 degrees on the hottest of summer days in New Zealand.\
  \ Although walking on the sunburnt sand dunes, on my way to a hidden beach certainly\
  \ felt nothing less than 50 degrees heat. It is a walk of almost one kilometre,\
  \ from the nearest car park where I parked my beautiful little pink car, that had\
  \ needed a well deserved break. To be able to get to Whatipu (pronounced Faateepu)\
  \ beach, one has to drive through a small fishing town, a lot of windy roads and\
  \ a never ending gravel road. When you get to the carpark, there are no designated\
  \ carpark spots, you just have to park where there is less of grass. Once you get\
  \ past the scorching sand and signs suggesting 'swimming not recommended', you begin\
  \ to see the big blue ocean. And unusual for Auckland summer beaches, there is no\
  \ one around. Did I miss the memo you wonder for a second? But it doesn't take you\
  \ long to realise, beautiful places are never discovered alone, you discover them\
  \ without your own-self.\n \nI lay my beach towel on the sand, i make place for\
  \ my self somewhere on the beach, well before indulging into the warmth of the ocean.\
  \ As I walk around, to look for the right spot to get into water. I see a few gentlemen,\
  \ in their early twenties collecting mussels from the rocks behind. \"Just be careful,\
  \ the water levels rise up and down fairly quickly\". \"But you certainly can swim\"\
  , they laugh as they mock the signs outside. I am used to of swimming in the ocean,\
  \ but I am also quite watchful of the signs. Although it is not recommended to swim\
  \ on Whatipu beach, it is important to swim where there are other people swimming\
  \ incase of an emergency.\n\nAs the waves throw me around, I feel that I have finally\
  \ let nature take control of my life. I feel one with the nature, in a way that\
  \ I have not felt in years. Nearby not far from the beach, is a small hill and on\
  \ top of that is a lighthouse. I decide to do the unthinkable, I start running towards\
  \ the lighthouse bare-feet. It reminds me of little me, I would run for whatever\
  \ caught my attention without having to think much of the consequences. And quite\
  \ often, as a little child I discovered so many beautiful places (just like the\
  \ pond-filled with tadpoles next door to my house). As I approach the lighthouse,\
  \ I am met with deep blue ocean in almost 180 degrees with no other land mass in\
  \ sight. The views are spectacular but the lighthouse gives it a charm of a remote\
  \ beach. I sit by the lighthouse until the sunset, while the sand cools down."
