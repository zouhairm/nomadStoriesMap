Text: "We came from a busy city, she from another province. We rode a van, she barefooted.\
  \ We had multi-colored hankies to cover our heads, she had one-peso coins beaded\
  \ as head band. \nMelly Castor, 56, is a Panay Bukidnon cultural master from Minan,\
  \ Tapaz, Capiz. Binukot as she is, she amused us with her chanting of Sugidanon\
  \ and hand-made embroideries. \nNever to be exposed to the sun nor seen by other\
  \ people, a binukot which literally means \u2018kept maiden\u2019 is not allowed\
  \ to get out of the house. In the community, she is treated like a princess where\
  \ she is being bathed, combed and served by her family. True to her princess status,\
  \ the binukot receives only the best of things and is taught the tribe\u2019s traditions\
  \ like memorizing Sugidanon, a long verbal narrative which contains the epics of\
  \ Panay through chanting.\nWhen she reaches the right age, she is allowed to be\
  \ seen in public to lead the tribal ceremony and to entertain her fellow tribesmen\
  \ with the Binanog dance.\nHer princess-like benefits do not end once she is seen\
  \ in public. Whenever she leaves her home, she is carried on a hammock to make sure\
  \ her feet do not touch the ground.\nThe\u2018binanog dance\u2019 closely imitates\
  \ the movements of the hawk or \u2018banog\u2019, where the dance got its name.\
  \ In this dance, the woman is in charge. The man observes and matches the steps\
  \ of the woman, his movement dependent on her every move and shift. This is also\
  \ associated to be a courtship or love dance.\nThe binukot\u2019s hand for marriage\
  \ goes to the man who offers the biggest dowry. Even then, tradition demands that\
  \ the man cannot see her until after marriage. It doesn\u2019t matter where the\
  \ man came from as long as he is able to bid the highest price.\nA binukot is usually\
  \ frail, who knows nothing about doing chores or the practical ways of living.\n\
  While these kept maidens are often physically weak, they serve an important function\
  \ in keeping their traditions alive. Through them, they preserve the ages-long epics\
  \ and legends of their tribes. The binukot is also the embodiment of the culture\
  \ and tradition their ancestors have worked so hard to practice and perpetuate for\
  \ decades.\nPanay Bukidnon rely on agriculture as their main source of livelihood.\
  \ They plant and grow root crops and they also attend to domestic animals in order\
  \ to survive.\nWith attaining education becoming their priority over grooming their\
  \ daughters for marriage, only a few families of the Panay Bukidnon still continue\
  \ the tradition of choosing a binukot."
