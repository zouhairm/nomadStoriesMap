Text: "The horizon was painted orange, yellow, red and violet at sunset. Embarking\
  \ on the adventure to explore the beautiful salt-lake of the Rann of Kutch in Gujarat\
  \ seemed worth facing the surprises along the journey. The biggest surprise was\
  \ when we found ourselves stranded on the roadside for over an hour around Hodka\
  \ with the afternoon sun shining brightly near a rustic village in the backdrop,\
  \ with absolutely no transport to get us to our destination.\nThe unusual breakfast\
  \ of fafda (kind of fritters) with raw cut onions and fried green chilly was surprisingly\
  \ tasty. Following this was the visit to Kalo Dungar which is the highest peak in\
  \ the Kutch region. The entire salt-lake is visible from atop. The edge of the lake\
  \ could easily be mistaken for the surf of the waves on a beach. It was difficult\
  \ to spot where the lake ends and the sky starts from this vantage. Dawn and dusk\
  \ not only provide the best view but as per local tradition it\u2019s also when\
  \ the native hyenas are fed.\nSince the road transport isn\u2019t well connected\
  \ and infrequent there is a lot of dependence on private shared vehicles. Modified\
  \ goods carrying vans are commonly used. Sitting benches have been added on either\
  \ side of the storage container at the back. Women were traveling with children\
  \ and the men with their supplies. The men usually sat on the vehicles\u2019 roof\
  \ or hanged on the foot board. And every time a woman passenger was added to the\
  \ storage container, a man would be moved to the roof of the bus. However, I thought\
  \ the vehicle was too small for everyone\u2019s comfort though the locals didn\u2019\
  t seem to mind. \nThe women wore elaborate traditional nose rings made of gold and\
  \ semi-precious stone beads, which were so large and heavy that they had to be supported\
  \ by a strong string which was passed through their hair partition and then woven\
  \ into their braids. However, the string was hidden under their Dupattas used to\
  \ cover the head and part of the face. The nose rings were a sign of tradition and\
  \ wealth that the father of the bride was obliged to shower at her wedding. So,\
  \ the larger the nose ring the better it was. I believe these women were in-turn\
  \ equally amused with us without covered heads or nose rings.\nWe finally reached\
  \ the white salt-lake just as the sun was setting. It looked mesmerizing reflecting\
  \ the vivid colours of the horizon. Folk music mixed with the excited chattering\
  \ of children, horse and camel rides, walks on the salt and the cool dry breeze\
  \ have added to the wonderful memories."
