Text: "\u201CWhat do you think he\u2019ll magic up next?\u201D Jason asked, bewildered.\
  \ \u201CBecause we could do with two tickets back to Budapest\u201D.\n\nI think\
  \ back to ten years ago, sat in that sticky train station dive bar \u2013 a universal\
  \ quality of railway watering holes \u2013 I\u2019d prefer to remember that I was\
  \ smiling back at the old man sat across from me. In reality, I was exhausted from\
  \ a sleepless night, and I know my expression was a little more confused than entertained.\n\
  \nThe previous evening we\u2019d accidentally stumbled into Hungary\u2019s fifth\
  \ largest city, P\xE9cs. Saying that we\u2019d mistakenly taken the last train to\
  \ a town with a UNESCO heritage site may seem like hyperbolic romanticism. There\
  \ was nothing romantic about having to spend the night in a car park. It was only\
  \ meant to be a few hours to Gy\u0151r, but a good few hours more and we\u2019d\
  \ realised we\u2019d headed towards Gy\xF6re. An easy mistake\u2026\n\nLike a modern-day\
  \ nativity, sans virgin, we went from inn to inn to inn with pockets full of small\
  \ change but no luck. A thousand Forints weren\u2019t enough for a bed. We had no\
  \ concept of the old Hungarian proverb \u201Conly stretch as far as your blanket\
  \ reaches\u201D, loosely translated to \u201Cdon\u2019t spend beyond your means\u201D\
  . We didn\u2019t have a blanket, either, just a car park.\n\nWaking up to the coughing\
  \ honk of an old soviet banger at dawn, we headed back to the station through the\
  \ city. I had expected it to be a nowhere kind of town but instead I was annoyed\
  \ we hadn\u2019t come sooner. We\u2019d made it to a beautiful city square with\
  \ the repurposed architectural remains of Turkish legacy. They say Istanbul is where\
  \ East meets West, but I think we can arrange a rendezvous somewhere in P\xE9cs.\
  \ \n\nBack at the station bar I buried myself in one of its sticky booths until\
  \ a loud clap caused me to sit upright. An old, bald man clutching at a basket of\
  \ roses decided to sit with us. \u201CUnwelcomed company\u201D, I thought. After\
  \ a minute or two he was proudly performing pseudo-magic tricks and Jiu-Jitsu moves,\
  \ conjuring up flowers to give to us (slyly drawn from his sleeve). At first, I\
  \ barely entertained him, but soon I was pulling my pen out from behind his ears.\
  \ We didn\u2019t understand each other yet we happily spent the next hour or so\
  \ in stitches. You don\u2019t need language for laughter.\n\n\u201CWhat do you think\
  \ he\u2019ll magic up next?\u201D, Jason asked. We didn\u2019t get the two tickets\
  \ back to Budapest and we didn\u2019t need them. The conductor let us off the fare,\
  \ howling at my badly-sketched comic strip explaining how we\u2019d ended up in\
  \ P\xE9cs."
