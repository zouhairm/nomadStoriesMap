Text: "The last thing I expected was to find myself down a dark alleyway, tentatively\
  \ whispering \u201Cnamaskar\u201D through a square hole cut into a corrugated metal\
  \ door. It was cold and harsh, a bizarre contrast to the warmth of the ancient wooden\
  \ carvings adorning the beams that framed this urban anachronism. \n\nTime had become\
  \ a blurry, inconsequential suggestion, providing little orientation in my current\
  \ reality. Some days included modern conveniences like electricity and running water.\
  \ Other days found me coaxing warm milk from suspicious goats, sponge-bathing by\
  \ candlelight, praying to unknown beings in temples built before the prayers passed\
  \ down from my grandparents existed.\n\nI was four months\u2019 into a quest for\
  \ enlightenment that had taken me through India, China, and Tibet. From rooftop\
  \ yoga to meditation cave visions, I was insatiable for spiritual sustenance. \n\
  \nMy stomach growled. I had been wandering the streets of Kathmandu since before\
  \ the sunrise, and in a few hours\u2019 time it was due to rise again. My mind whirled\
  \ with the sights and sounds of the day, the street children pleading for milk,\
  \ the hundreds of glowing candles around Boudhanath stupa, the smell of burning\
  \ flesh intermingled with incense at the Pashupatinath cremation ghats. And the\
  \ monkeys! So many monkeys! My legs were sore from walking up and down hundreds\
  \ of steps, twisting through uneven, narrow streets, temple after temple, vendor\
  \ after vendor, I wanted to taste it all. \n\nI was hungry. Not just for experiences,\
  \ but for actual food. Which is why I found myself in front of a square hole in\
  \ a metal door down a small alley in a strange city on the other side of the world.\
  \ I passed a folded-up piece of paper into the buzzing fluorescence of the hole.\
  \ The paper was taken. A hand appeared. I offered up some rupees and waited.\n\n\
  Five minutes later, a sandwich emerges. The bread is golden. There is lettuce and\
  \ tomato and some kind of sauce that looks like mayonnaise but isn\u2019t. Or maybe\
  \ it is. These are not the safe foods to eat whilst traveling, but I take the risk.\
  \ There is cheese! I haven\u2019t had cheese in months. I don\u2019t care how they\
  \ got muenster in Nepal, I just crumple with tired happiness against the wooden\
  \ beams and devour this most amazing creation birthed from that tiny glowing square."
