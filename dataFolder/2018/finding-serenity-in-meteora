Text: "I was in my first year out of college, working full-time in cubicle hell. I\
  \ had already been bitten by the travel bug but couldn\u2019t afford to travel yet.\
  \ I worked on saving every penny, as I absolutely needed to go to Greece! I mean,\
  \ Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants\u2026 am I right?\n\nA few months before my\
  \ trip, my grandma passed away suddenly. We were very close and her death really\
  \ affected me. In addition, my boyfriend broke up with me two weeks before my trip.\
  \ I was in a dark place and was happy to be leaving Canada to experience a new part\
  \ of the world.\n\nOnce I touched down in Athens, I spent the evening exploring,\
  \ making new friends, and eating delicious gyros. The next morning I hopped on a\
  \ bus to Kalambaka. I arrived later than anticipated but was excited for my hike\
  \ in Meteora, so I wanted to get settled and get a good night\u2019s sleep.\n\n\
  Meteora is a quaint town in the valley, underneath monasteries with yellow brick\
  \ facades and faded red roofs that sit atop pillars of rock. The pillars now colour\
  \ the landscape with different shades of grey, black, green, and the lush vegetation\
  \ that grows on them. This is a natural phenomenon that was created 60 million years\
  \ ago from the movement of the earth, and the water and wind weathering the columns.\
  \ In present day, there is no water in sight, and the monastery-topped pillars are\
  \ set high above the town. It made me appreciate the intricacy of the architecture\
  \ of these awe-inspiring structures from the 14th century. In fact, the monks actually\
  \ used cable cars to get from the mainland across to the monasteries on the pillars.\n\
  \nI am not a religious person but the monasteries transported me back to a medieval\
  \ time and made me believe in something greater than myself. Walking into the monastery\
  \ filled me with a sense of peace and safety, and I felt like my grandma was there\
  \ with me. This feeling completely overwhelmed me. I took a moment to light a candle\
  \ and pray for my grandma while weeping silently, you know, sobbing and blowing\
  \ my nose loudly seemed like it would be frowned upon. \n\nAfter leaving the monastery,\
  \ I stumbled upon this amazing vista. Once I reached the edge, I was overlooking\
  \ the valley from an exhilarating height. I was between the two largest monasteries\
  \ and had breathtaking panoramic views. I anticipated a beautiful view, but the\
  \ last thing I expected to gain from this experience was the profound understanding\
  \ of how small our problems are, in comparison to the wonders this world has to\
  \ offer."
