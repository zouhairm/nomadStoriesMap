Text: "There are shortcuts to happiness and dancing is one of them.My love for dancing\
  \ and learning new dance forms took me to places. I had learnt Latin American dances\
  \ before like salsa,lambada,meringue but never tried my hands on famous ballroom\
  \ dance such as Tango.I firmly believe what we think and manifest becomes real in\
  \ our life.while I was thinking and contemplating how to know more about Tango I\
  \ came across this advertisement on travel website that Buones aires (tango world\
  \ capital) is hosting an annual festival and world tournament.\nBIZARRE TRAVEL PLANS\
  \ ARE DANCING LESSONS FROM GOD. Saying Buones aires you say tango and when you think\
  \ of tango reminds you of streets of buones aires.I found about this famous dancing\
  \ club in La Boca online and contacted them .\nLucio Maricio, one of the dance instructors\
  \ greeted me at the Buones aires airport.He was lean athletic with dark olive skin\
  \ and short curly hair with reddish tinge.His little knowledge of English had heavy\
  \ Spanish accent.\nAfter a breakfast of Empanadas and Pizza first day was spent\
  \ in learning tango steps at the club.Lucio made me dance on POR UNA CABEZA , a\
  \ famous number from the movie TRUE LIES.\nTango is more of dance of pain and love\
  \ and has sensual dance moves.It is like two bodies in close embrace.music can be\
  \ soulful and slow or fast and fun traditionally played with violins,piano and double\
  \ bass.By the end of day I had learnt three steps.\nNext day I went to lively,young\
  \ and artsy district of PALERMO for buying tango shoes.i spent some time sitting\
  \ in a cafe having Yeber mate(a caffiene drink)watching people dance tango to perfect\
  \ synchronisation and was quite enchanted by it.\nNext few days were spent learning\
  \ more steps and attending MILONGA in the evenings.it was a sort of floating dance\
  \ party and was a great experience.the place was packed tight with couples gyrating\
  \ to music on famous number LA CUMPARSITA.i loved the rhythm and flow. Lucio was\
  \ a great partner and his moves were gliding made me easier to dance. I was getting\
  \ tango crazy day by day.\nAfter spending 7 days,this cosmopolitan city became one\
  \ of my favourite places to be where I could imagine myself living forever for its\
  \ and mine love for dance.i really did feel at home away from home.\nI learnt love\
  \ is a universal language and dance is too not solo but partner dancing.i was going\
  \ back with beautiful memories and wonderful connections esp with my new friend\
  \ Lucio. \nI realised TRAVEL BRINGS POWER AND LOVE BACK TO YOUR LIFE."
