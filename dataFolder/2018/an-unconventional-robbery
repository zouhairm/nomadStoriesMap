Text: "Fraser Island, the largest sand island in the world, is home to long uninterrupted\
  \ beaches and an array of freshwater lakes. Consciously avoiding the organized tours,\
  \ my friends and I rented a 4x4 and drove up from Brisbane to discover the real\
  \ Fraser Island; by car, by ourselves, in the wild. \nWe had been driving on the\
  \ beach all day, enjoying the bumpy ride through the lush rainforest, over and under\
  \ tree roots, up and down soft and deep descents. We were astounded by the beauty\
  \ of this untapped paradise. Until we got stuck in the sand. We dug for hours until\
  \ it got dark, only hollowing out the sand grave further. On this island with no\
  \ electricity the darkness seemed to take over quicker and in a very consuming way.\
  \ So, we stayed put for the night.\nWe cooked our food and gathered around our self-made\
  \ lanterns from water bottles and flashlights. Exhausted, we laid down in the soft\
  \ sand. We listened to the silence only broken by the waves rolling in over the\
  \ beach. We looked upon the clear sky and saw a sea of shooting stars. Being stuck,\
  \ away from everything, brought with it a rare tranquillity.\nIt may have been the\
  \ sudden cold hitting us, forcing us to snuggle up in the tent. Or it may have been\
  \ the feeling that we were seemingly alone on this beautiful island underneath the\
  \ stars. But something had made us forget the golden Fraser Island rule; whatever\
  \ you do, do not leave out food. Because the dingoes will come for you.\nI woke\
  \ up in the night to howling and sniffing. I saw the shadows and recognized the\
  \ pointy triangular ears in an instant. I looked out the tiny tent top window, watching\
  \ the dingoes. One was busy opening a jar of Nutella, while another was, in an ostrich-like\
  \ manner, standing with its head deep in my bag. I knew it was too late and too\
  \ dangerous to stop them after having heard numerous stories about dingo attacks.\
  \ So back down I laid, listening to the raiding party going on right outside the\
  \ thin tent canvas.\nNext morning, my bag had been emptied and its contents spread\
  \ across our camp. The ostrich-like dingo had torn out all my clothes and dug its\
  \ way to my emergency-crackers. Even more impressive, was its raid of my toiletry\
  \ bag. Without ripping it apart, the dingo had gently opened the zipper and taken\
  \ out all edible content. Empty was my tube of toothpaste and gone were my throat\
  \ tablets. I had been robbed.\nAnd I realized; Australia is like a female assassin\
  \ in a James Bond movie; drop-dead gorgeous but always trying to kill you."
