Text: "Monta\xF1ita, Equador; hippy paradise. I was working behind the bar at a place\
  \ on the beach following leaving a short term employment at a rival hostel closer\
  \ to town for being too relaxed. Christmas Day, my first outside the UK & it feels\
  \ surreal being in the baking heat on 25th. Happily I inabrediated myself to ensure\
  \ an iota of familiarity. Over the previous few days I had become friends with an\
  \ outrageously unusual, extroverted & unstable couple. Steve & his cousin Mad Man\
  \ Dan. Steve is early sixties, chizzled good looks, the emancipated figure of a\
  \ life of abuse & a former rock star. I listened with open ears as Steve told me\
  \ about his time with New York Dolls in the 70s, partying in London & a mad world\
  \ even I had never laid eyes upon. He\u2019s a recovering heroin addict, currently\
  \ going cold turkey & has a charisma that is doifuclt to describe. Breaking the\
  \ ice with Steve was relatively easy, his younger cousin, Mad Man Dan is not even\
  \ 30 but clearly in charge & one of the most unpredictable individuals I have ever\
  \ had the pleasure of knowing. Frightening to many but a great lad, borderline schizophrenic\
  \ with a big heart. Steve, Dan, an 18 year old German lad called Noodle & I adopted\
  \ one other as pseudo family for Christmas & spent Xmas eve & the first 12 hours\
  \ of the day itself together having fun, getting loose. At midday I decided to walk\
  \ to the beach to spend some time alone & reflect. Monta\xF1ita Is known for surfing\
  \ & the waves are good for bouncing about. After almost one hour in the water I\
  \ caught Steve in the corner of my eye, choosing to ignore him & continue. Minutes\
  \ later I see Steve walking towards me, skinny jeans up to his knees, with his unmistakeable\
  \ features, silver hair & beard. Steve is distraught & crying, he begs me to help.\
  \ Confused, I urgently enquiry as to the problem as he reveals a small black turtle\
  \ in his hands which he tells me is in trouble. At first I tell him not to intervene\
  \ & that I\u2019m sure that Terry is fine, however Steve is genuinely concerned\
  \ & on close inspection, Terry is really struggling. Steve passes Terry to me &\
  \ I attempt to release him into the ocean but he is battered by the surf like a\
  \ hamster in a washing machine so I move to the shallows to re-evaluate. At this\
  \ moment Steve & I watch Terry die. Tears flow for tradegy. After a couple of minutes\
  \ contemplating mortality, a mirical! Terry is revived but still very weak. We rest\
  \ then I swim further out to release him, beyond the surf he leaves my hand with\
  \ vigor."
