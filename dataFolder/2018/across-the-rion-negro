Text: "Heart  of  Brasil, National  Park sorrounded by  the immensity....Gardens \
  \ dedicated to  the upcoming of  next  Buddha, Maytreya...Chapada  dos  Veadeiros,\
  \ unknown and out  of  main turistic roads,  has  a lot of natural attractions such\
  \  as incredible  canyons in  the  middle  of  the  jungle..geological  rocks  of\
  \  remote ages...Me  and  Kate  decided  to  have a  tour  in  the  jungle of  the\
  \  park  and  we  choosen  Flaviano, from  the  North  of  Brasil.\nHe looked like\
  \  very  safe and  sure  of  himself...we started to walk and soon  we  arrived\
  \  close  to  the  Rio  Negro  that  we  must cross to keep our  path..suddenly\
  \  it  starts to  rain  heavily....The  river is not so  large,  but the flow is\
  \  growing  quickly....the  water runs  terribly...While me  and  kate  we  were\
  \ asking  what to  do,  Flaviano  started  to cross the  river by  himself....when\
  \ was  close to  the  other side, water brought  it  away....but  he's able to cathc\
  \ a branch  of  a tree....could  finish  definitely  worse....Kate without  hesitations,started\
  \  go in  the  water swimming  and  running furiosly  to save  him, and  even  her\
  \ is  brought  away  from  the terrible flow  of  the  river....amazing...all  this\
  \  happened  in  few  seconds....she could barely  catch the  same  branch  of \
  \ Flaviano and  the  two are  safe quickly...in the  same  time,  the  rain  stops\
  \ slowly  and  the  river is easier  to cross...my  goodness,  i cross easily  the\
  \  river and i'm ultra-safe in it.\nFlaviano doesn't   said  a  word,as for  him\
  \ was  something  ordinary, but this  is  not  the  safest tour guide  i  ever \
  \ met  in  my  life...Kate,  wasn't    upset, but  rather admired  by  the  braveness\
  \ of Flaviano and  somehow  disappointed by  my  slowliness to cross that Rio  Negro...\
  \ \nThe  path  keeps ahead but we our  hearts are divided...as  it  seeems...Kate\
  \ keep on looking  Flaviano in  this  strange  way....needless to  be  jealous...but\
  \ a  mix of incredible  emotions in  absolutely  invading  me...as  the  water of\
  \  Rio  Negro..."
