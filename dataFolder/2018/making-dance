Text: "In conversation with a coworker just now, I realized that it was Memorial Day.\
  \ This realization struck me as rather ironic really. Considering where I live,\
  \ what I\u2019ve been working on from yesterday, and what has happened thus far\
  \ today.\nI live in [email\_protected] Yes, really. One of the silly poems I wrote\
  \ in the poem-a-day series had a line that read, \u201CCan we do it? Yes, we can.\
  \ For we live in [email\_protected]!\u201D It has a catchy enough rhyme to it that\
  \ I\u2019ve found myself repeating that line in my head periodically, as things\
  \ happen that remind me of my surreal reality. Case in point: that \u201Csilly\u201D\
  \ poem was not so silly after all, for it was about our most recent stint of taking\
  \ shelter from hours of gunfire, bomb blasts, and rocket soundings.\nBut in the\
  \ midst of this surreality, we held a grand, celebratory dance recital yesterday.\
  \ Here, of all places\u2013a celebration of dance! And it was indeed a celebration:\
  \ a truly beautiful one.\nSo this morning I was teaching a kindergarten class, in\
  \ which we discussed jobs. And no, I do not habitually discuss gainful employment\
  \ with 5-year olds: this stemmed from a reading of the book \u201CFox on the Job.\u201D\
  \nBut in our discussion, I asked the children to share what they wanted to be when\
  \ they grew up, and why. There were the usual responses: doctor, teacher, nurse.\
  \ But one \u201Cusual\u201D answer had an unusual \u201Cwhy\u201D added to it. He\
  \ wanted to be a policeman. Oh good, I said. And why is that? \u201CBecause we have\
  \ a gun at home. And I want to use a gun.\u201D\nAfter a pause, I said \u201Cok\u201D\
  \ and hurried on to the next raised hand. Maybe I should have done something more\
  \ with that response but you know, I just didn\u2019t know what to say. I was more\
  \ than relieved with the next answer of \u201Cteacher.\u201D And then amused by\
  \ the added \u201CDance teacher\u201D description. Now there\u2019s a hopeful thought,\
  \ in the midst of this, whatever this may be, which I dare say I often don\u2019\
  t know . . . Make dance, not war?"
