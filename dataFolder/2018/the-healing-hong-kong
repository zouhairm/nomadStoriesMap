Text: "The last thing I expected to get from my trip to Hong Kong was to get so close\
  \ relationships with my family.My story has started to take over from the very moment\
  \ I remember myself. My mother: the strongest woman I know and who I love and admire\
  \ the most had to work hard from the moment she\u2019d become a single mother with\
  \ two small kids. Earlier she worked to feed us, later to give us more opportunities,\
  \ education and show us the world.But life is always about giving up on something.\
  \ For our family it was time. The time she could not spend with me and my brother.As\
  \ my brother went to a boarding school I was all by myself. And the more my mother\
  \ worked, the further my brother went to study lately the longer a distance we all\
  \ three had in our relationships.Actually, if you feel familiar with my situation\
  \ I have an advice for you.  Just take time and go on a vacation together. We packed\
  \ our things and left for Hong Kong.Not everyone knows that Hong Kong is an administrative\
  \ part of China.So actually it means that Hong Kong manages its domestic politics\
  \ and economy independently, but foreign affairs and military defense are assigned\
  \ to China.The thing my mother needed the most was our help.We translated more than\
  \ conversations or street signs, we helped her to interpret information she was\
  \ receiving. These required a lot of patience, trust, and readiness to explain things\
  \ that were a common sense for us but not for her.But in exchange, we've received\
  \ that glowing smile, eyes full of happiness and pure joy. She was enjoying every\
  \ tree, every tall building, and every outdoor huge screen. By the way, some streets\
  \ resemble the New York Times Square, due to the abundance of neon advertisements.We\
  \ walked along the streets a lot. In general, for fans of walking Hong Kong is an\
  \ ideal place.In addition, Hong Kong is a pastry paradise, as we tried numerous\
  \ amount of pastries and there was no place for regret.So these food marathons lead\
  \ to the point where we were sharing our impressions, advises, fun stories and a\
  \ lot of what united us as a family and as real friends.Next three days were full\
  \ of emotions, new adventures, and fun. Standing on the peak Victoria made me realized\
  \ that some countries are really good at being friends with nature, an amazing view\
  \ that looked like a beautiful bouquet of trees and tall buildings.\nAfter all,\
  \ I realized, only the time spent with the family will make you a truly happy person,\
  \ and this is the priceless gift any vacation can give you."
