  \ \u2013 Maryam Shahidi; Iranian doctor, Philosoph, hobby psychologist aka. my mom.\n\
  As supporters of the Pahlavi dynasty my parents had to emigrate due to political\
  \ persecution during the Islamic revolution in Iran in 1979. They chose Germany\
  \ as a new home for me and my brother to have to have free access to higher education.\n\
  As a small child, when I was overhearing conversations of my mother talking to our\
  \ close relatives who remained in my home country, I realized how lucky we were\
  \ to live in a social democratic welfare system.\nNonetheless, I always felt the\
  \ urge to help my family in Iran which resulted in an attitude of making the most\
  \ out of the available resources as well and as quickly as I can.\nThis inner drive\
  \ is visible throughout my whole curriculum:\nStarting with an premature school\
  \ entry at the age of five years, continuing with a one year faster high school\
  \  completion(G8) with a parallel International Baccalaureate Diploma and eventually\
  \ enrolling as well as graduating quicker from university.\n\nNonetheless, I also\
  \ wanted to widen my horizon by travelling and started working working full-time\
  \ as a flight attendant. \nI thought the double workload would reveal my true skills\
  \ and push me to the edge, but eventually I had found  myself rather on the emotional\
  \ edge knowing I\u2019d disappoint my mum.\nI realised that by going all in for\
  \ both \n I  had eventually received nothing. Because the real success is not what\
  \ we achieve but how much we enjoy the pocess itself ."
