Text: recently i trekked naggtibba hills.my first trekking ever and yes i would call
  it my life's    summary.as excited as a baby to climb it up the hills i started
  my walk with great enthusiasm and with optimisation.after  some half kilometres
  up i got into my  knees.  i started sweating,my heart was no less fast than flash
  all my friends stopped to  get me composed. i had water and restarted my climb.it
  was still 5 kms. more to climb and i was going up losing my hopes on my breath strangely  just
  one friend  accompanied me with my all my pauses and suffering rest continued to
  there climbs after stopping once. as we reached base camp my guide ask me to stay
  there itself and not climb till summit  i followed his wish. next mornimg everyone
  left for summit. as i woke up i had my tea(truley one of the best tea of my lif).and
  started a conversation with the cook and caretaker i got sufficient time intract
  with the localites. i got intense with my talk and within this six hours i got to
  know about the culture,ideology,mindset,political work and their attitude. a trust
  me, i was statisfied with my trip. what makes a place is the people and their attitude.
  to discover a place gives you a epiphany of discovering yourself. the more you relate
  yourself to your trip the more you get meditated towards satisfaction and its variables.like
  you take time to work gift yourself with the to travel.
