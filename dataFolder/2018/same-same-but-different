Text: "My friend and I arrived to a small town in Vietnam to spend the night and cross\
  \ the border to Cambodia. We didn't want to stay at a hotel so we requested to stay\
  \ at a local's home. We stood in front of a hotel and waited. It was 2am. Suddenly,\
  \ 2 old and run down motor bikes appear out of nowhere. Destroyed helmets too big\
  \ and without straps\u2026 we climbed on the back of the bikes. Without further\
  \ ado I grabbed tight to my Vietnamese driver. It was like holding to a 12 year\
  \ old: skinny, awkward and shy. Had he lost me on the road, no one would have ever\
  \ found out. \nAfter about 20 minutes of riding through Vietnamese roads, we arrived\
  \ to some sort of an abandoned or shut down street market, in the middle of nowhere.\
  \ Note to self: I remembered then that a friend used to tell me: \"Betina, in Vietnam,\
  \ street lights are just a suggestion\". In effect, thousands of motorcyclists roam\
  \ down the streets at any given time. If you need to cross the street, just do it.\
  \ Thousands and thousands of people, sort of a human tidal wave, all wearing surgical\
  \ masks and moving fast through the streets.\nNo lights, or signs or anyone that\
  \ could tell us what's next. Our unknown motorcycle drivers disappeared into the\
  \ night, and for a couple of seconds we thought that this was it for us. A man showed\
  \ up and with plenty of hand gestures asked us to follow him. We walked downhill\
  \ through a short path and arrived to the Mekong. Through the darkness we could\
  \ see a small raft, and we jumped on it, without giving it much of a thought.\n\
  The Mekong seemed like a giant black mass, impossible to sort.  All I could think\
  \ was: \"Why did I watch 'Apocalypse now\"? In a minute, corpses are going to start\
  \ emerging from these dark waters, and that'll be it for us!\" The traverse continued\
  \ in silence. Half an hour later, we arrived to a small wharf, and someone approached\
  \ us.\n\"Hi! You arrived! Welcome to my home!\" We were able to breathe again. We\
  \ thought this was our host. We jumped off the raft, and asked him in English (which\
  \ he seemed to barely understand) to thank our boatman, our Vietnamese Charon, ferryman\
  \ of Hades.  \"He is my father\", said our host.  He provided the best dinner we\
  \ have ever had while crossing a border.  The next morning, when we woke up and\
  \ were able to explore the surroundings, we realized that in the house we had our\
  \ own \"monkey bridge\". We also realized that after overcoming fear, we were able\
  \ to live one of the best experiences ever, trying to (and making) contact with\
  \ locals."
