Text: "In mythical Vrindavan, a village tucked in an arc of the Yamuna, young Krishna\
  \ was in a rueful state. He asked his mother, \"Why is Radha's skin so fair while\
  \ mine is dusky?\" Appealing to her son's playfulness, the mother replied, \"Why\
  \ don't you coat Radha's face in color? Then you will be the same.\"\n\nIn not-so-mythical\
  \ Vrindavan, Ron and I descended the dusty hotel steps, pale as the Taj, donning\
  \ the spotless white kurtas that the clothier had been reluctant to sell us the\
  \ night before. He had known the kurtas' fate. It was Holi, the festival of colors.\
  \ No thread was safe.\n\nBefore India, I had never felt the sensation of being an\
  \ alien. A traveler, sure, even a foreigner. But I'd never encountered a place so\
  \ dizzying, so staunchly itself, that I lost all sense of belonging. The line between\
  \ appropriate and appropriation is often unmarked, and here I was, a gora in the\
  \ home of Krishna, on one of their holiest days. Was I welcome?\n\nRon and I armed\
  \ ourselves with baggies of powder (\"Which color?\" the cross-legged merchant asked.\
  \ \"All of them,\" we replied) and wound along narrow backstreets, past resting\
  \ cows adorned with marigolds. Steadily, the world around us transformed into a\
  \ vivid melee. Our kurtas were eager canvasses.\n\nThe mania of the throng ahead\
  \ illuminated the way to Banke Bihari Temple. We followed as it bottlenecked and\
  \ rushed up the steps. An old woman, one of the brave few in the crowd, scolded\
  \ me in Hindi just outside the doorway, gesturing: Lose the sandals, gora.\n\nInside,\
  \ ecstatic chants\u2013Krishna Krishna! Hare Hare!\u2013echoed everywhere. Powders\
  \ burst from the rafters onto the crowd. All eyes were on the priest who blasted\
  \ fuschia water from a platform. I reached through the collar of my kurta, unzipped\
  \ my travel pouch, and held up my phone. A man shook his head: Not in here, gora.\n\
  \nBy the time I jostled my way to the far door, Ron was nowhere to be found. Barefoot\
  \ and lost, I found respite by a shuttered storefront. From nowhere, two small hands\
  \ smeared my face with something wet. I wiped my eyes and opened them to the toothy\
  \ grin of a young boy. My hands were moss green. The boy took them, cupped them,\
  \ filled them with green paste, and held his face up to me: Come on, gora!\n\nI\
  \ ran my palms across his face, painting it green. He took out a phone and held\
  \ it up to show our work. \"Green! Same!\" he shouted.\n\nLike Radha and Krishna,\
  \ bound by playful color.\n\nHe tapped the screen and took the selfie, and finally\
  \ I felt it. Green. Same. Alien no more."
