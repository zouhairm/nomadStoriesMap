Text: "I am happy. I am lucky to be born and to live in such a unique and amazing\
  \ country. Russia is the land of Siberia, Lake Baikal, the volcanoes of Kamchatka,\
  \ beautiful rivers, stunning forests and picturesque cities. I love Russia and I'm\
  \ proud that this is my homeland!\n\nI'm even more happy that in October 2017 Russia\
  \ hosted the most ambitious, magnificent and modern youth event. The World Festival\
  \ of Youth and Students changed my life, opened my eyes and gave me an incredible\
  \ source of happiness and inspiration.\_\n\nAs soon as I found out about the selection,\
  \ I decided that I just couldn't miss this opportunity to meet the world. After\
  \ all, the festival attracted students and young people from more than 190 countries\
  \ to get to know each other and to share plans for the future. This was an excellent\
  \ chance to help achieve my childhood dream of traveling. Now it seems to me that\
  \ even then I understood that this festival would be a life-changing event. But\
  \ I did not even suspect that the emotions and feelings in Sochi would help me make\
  \ a decision that pushed me to the edge.\n\nOn one of the festival days I attended\
  \ a lecture of the world-famous writer Frederik Begbeder. He shared a thought with\
  \ us that has been spinning in my head: \"... go out, do not study too much... When\
  \ you meet people, you will know how to talk to them, you have fun, you will learn\
  \ to dance, seduce someone, dress well and find your own style.\" And what if not\
  \ the festival is my way out to people? Among my classmates I felt like a stranger,\
  \ as if I was not doing my own thing. After studying 4 years, I knew for certain\
  \ that I did not want to associate my life with the doctor's work. But I was afraid\
  \ to leave the academy and to do what I really like. And at the festival, getting\
  \ to know the youth, I felt myself at home. I thought a lot over the fateful words\
  \ and realised that I couldn't live like I used to. I decided to do what I love,\
  \ and besides, I realised that my dream may come true! This summer I and my festival\
  \ friends are going to Siberia. And also, I have started a blog in which I share\
  \ my impressions and thoughts with people. I want to get a profession that will\
  \ be understandable to people regardless of the language they speak. I want to help\
  \ people around the world express their mood through the language of art, just as\
  \ a smile helps us express our emotions through facial expressions. And I am going\
  \ to tell everyone about my discoverires that I will meet on my way."
