Text: "'As it drizzled and surroundings grew gloomy, the sea wasn't safe anymore.\
  \ But I weathered the storm and saw my ship sail because it wasn't meant to be on\
  \ the shore.'\n\nOur decision-making ability defines us, and it's the one step we\
  \ fear the most that lead us to life-changing glory. The success that follows tastes\
  \ the sweetest and years later when you sit back and contemplate, you raise a toast\
  \ to yourself with an accomplished grin, \"blessed I was that I stepped up to the\
  \ occasion and pulled it off\".\n\nI landed in a similar situation a couple of months\
  \ ago when I had to run from pillar to post to get a French Visa issued for my first\
  \ international trip. Because it had been awhile since my last trip and I can't\
  \ suppress the urge to travel for long. After touring India for almost 3 years,\
  \ I desired to drift past Asia this time around and go exploring Europe.\n\nWhenever\
  \ I picturized Europe, I fancied gothic monuments on either side of street towering\
  \ above me, peering right into my eyes. Their style and artistry have always left\
  \ me intrigued. Besides, I desired to experience the European way of life, taste\
  \ their staple food, and watch them celebrate their festivals and do their daily\
  \ chores. And all of these yearnings became more persistent after I planned to see\
  \ my Polish girlfriend on New Year's Eve and explore her beautiful country.\n\n\
  As it turned out, it wasn't a cakewalk at all and I had to toil really hard to bag\
  \ the Visa.  Facing the rejection in succession yet applying for the third straight\
  \ time required a great deal of daring since plenty of my savings was already lost\
  \ as the rejected visa fee. I sat upset outside the visa office, down and disheartened.\
  \ The last bit of hope and my gut instinct prompted me to go for one last try. \n\
  \nIn that moment, the decision pushed me to the edge because I had all my bookings\
  \ done and I feared a likely third rejection. But my aspirations soared high and\
  \ heart awaited a possible wave of change. The first trip outside India was barely\
  \ a few weeks away and I was but confident about it.\n\nThat's when the stars smiled\
  \ and I, somehow, got to know about a senior of mine from high school who is India's\
  \ Ambassador in Afghanistan. Upon request, he promptly wrote me a recommendation\
  \ and France Embassy didn't take too long to oblige me with a Schengen Visa.\n\n\
  I had my back against the wall yet I chose not to give in and made sure that I was\
  \ sitting in the Paris bound KLM Royal Dutch international flight from New Delhi\
  \ on 25th December 2017."
