Text: "She was the epitome of a modern Bangkok woman, with stylish clothing and a\
  \ big Thai smile.  She wore sunglasses on the plane.  Her slender wrists were shining\
  \ with gold bangles, and her lips were glossy.\n\nShe was having a conversation\
  \ in sign language over videophone just before takeoff.\n   \nAs the plane levels,\
  \ she taps my shoulder and flashes a huge grin.  Opening a magazine to a world map,\
  \ she points to me, then gestures her palm upward. I smile and point to Oregon.\
  \ She displays a picture on her phone of a young boy with a smile as wide as hers.\
  \ \u201CMy son,\u201D she mouths silently in English.  \u201CHandsome!\u201D I say,\
  \ uncertain if she understood me. Having mastered barely two Thai words and no sign\
  \ language, I assume our conversation might quickly dead end. Not so. I was in her\
  \ world now, a soundless world she was adept at navigating. \n\nShe plays a video\
  \ of her son, who stares eye-to-eye with a monkey. The monkey lunges and swoops\
  \ the red baseball cap off her son\u2019s head.  My laughter is audible, hers whisper-quiet,\
  \ like when you try to hold in a belly roar at a library.\n\nIn the last few weeks,\
  \ I\u2019d sought Thai massage as much for my sore body as for the chance to interact\
  \ with locals, allowing myself to be kneaded and twisted into a pretzel, then unwound\
  \ into a lump of bliss. But thus far I had found it difficult to form a bond deeper\
  \ than that of a customer.\n\nWe share photos of our pets and she lifts her pinky\
  \ to stroke my kitty\u2019s face. Her spunky antics make me giggle like crazy, but\
  \ we\u2019re interrupted by an announcement.  Landing already?\n\nShe grabs my hand\
  \ as we get off the plane. We swing our arms like two schoolgirls.  So this was\
  \ the famous Thai affection of which I\u2019d read so much about.\n\nWe race down\
  \ the moving walkway.  We have everyone nearby laughing at our Three Stooges antics,\
  \ her catching me as I feign a clumsy fall. She snaps a selfie of us, still wearing\
  \ her sunglasses.\n\nI see the hot midday sun flooding the exit doors.  Rot daangs,\
  \ the red truck taxis of Chiang Mai, wait outside.  She glances at the exit, kisses\
  \ me swiftly on the cheek, and darts off.  It was as if a hummingbird had just flown\
  \ in through my window, captivating me with its magical turquoise brilliance, then\
  \ flitted away.\n\nWe\u2019d had not just one, but two language barriers to cross.\
  \  Yet without speaking, we\u2019d connected more deeply than I had with most English-speaking\
  \ travelers I\u2019d met.  I wave goodbye to my new Thai friend.  She blows me a\
  \ kiss with a radiant smile."
