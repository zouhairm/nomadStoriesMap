Text: "Opera House is something I have only seen in pictures of severn wonders of\
  \ the world. Looking at it face-to-face was a dream come true. When I visited Opera\
  \ House, there were many bars next to it, one of the bars was Opera Bar. I was facinated\
  \ by the name and immediately I know that is the bar I want to go to.\n\nI was staying\
  \ at the Four Seasons Hotel, Sydney during a business visit. Every day after work,\
  \ we had a meeting at our hotel room. It wa a daily routine that after the meeting,\
  \ we would go back to our hotel rooms just a get dressed to go out and explore Syndey.\n\
  \nWe would go back to our hotel rooms, and make sure taht all our managers were\
  \ asleep, and then sneak out. On one such night, my friend and me went to Opera\
  \ House. We di nto go inside though, but we had a look from out. That is when we\
  \ saw Opera Bar. The bar had beautiful seating arrangement facing the sea. \n\n\
  I ordered our drinks and took my seat facing the waters. There was a all ladies\
  \ cruize on the waters. Oh my god, it was an amazing site. I could see ladies dancing\
  \ and singing, enjoying themselves. I wished even I could go to a cruize like that\
  \ some day. \n\nOur drink arrived and I had a look on the road, and I thought I\
  \ saw a bride. I wondered if I was drunk and asked my friend, it was indeed a bride.\
  \ I thought the couple came to the bar right after their wedding. But no, the bride\
  \ was along, she walked right into the bar and ordered a drink. She sat not far\
  \ away from us and looked very sad. I wonder what might have happened.\n\nAnyways,\
  \ I let her be, and continued with my drinks and food. I love experimenting with\
  \ food. So, I order prawns pizza, and fish head and chips. My friend got scared\
  \ when he heard the menu and wondered if I was going to feed him fish head. But\
  \ when our order arrived, it was amazing.\n\nI fell in love with the waiter, he\
  \ was balancing some 30 glasses one on top of the other and clearing the tables.\
  \ Wow, that is a tough job. When he came to table next to ours, I gave him a compliment\
  \ and said he is doing a great job. He was very happy and said it was the first\
  \ time someone complimented him. He said he was from Russia and it was hard finding\
  \ a job here. He stopped abrubtly and went away saying good bye.\n\nI kept loooking\
  \ at the water, and noticed that the water was glitering. How was that possible?\
  \ When I showed my friend he said I might be drunk. \n\nWhatever it was, it was\
  \ beautiful. Every memory of that day is imprint in my heart which I can reproduce\
  \ anytime and anyday."
