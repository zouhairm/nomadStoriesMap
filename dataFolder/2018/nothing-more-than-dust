Text: "The slate coloured cobblestone ripped into my flesh. Sand that had formed from\
  \ the streets pricked and rolled around on my fragile skin, worsening the pain when\
  \ I moved. My back ached from bending over, my knees wept blood, and I continued\
  \ this holy vigil that I had embarked upon with my Guatemalan family. \n I would\
  \ not last long, and I understood that all six family members who had been here\
  \ for hours already would continue to work long after I quit. Each stout figure\
  \ set on completing the task. I looked at my host brother\u2019s face. Small beads\
  \ of perspiration sat stubbornly on his brow, refusing to slide down his skin that\
  \ matched the colour of the Guatemalan coffee. I knew I looked very different; my\
  \ face red, blotchy and covered in sweat. Our differences stood out in direct contrast\
  \ and yet our purpose was the same. \n I stood up, staring at the half-completed\
  \ alfombra. Its brightly coloured sawdust beginning to weave together to form a\
  \ \u201Ccarpet\u201D over the hard street. Nothing more than dust forming a beautiful\
  \ creation. \n As I stretched, I asked, \u201Crep\xEDteme por qu\xE9 hacemos esto?\u201D\
  \ stumbling over the foreign words. Oriz, my host Mom, who seemed to carry the weight\
  \ of the world around with her, did not straighten her shoulders or stop her work.\
  \ Instead, she slowly and patiently answered my question. Slowly because she knew\
  \ that if she spoke too fast I would not be able to understand a word she said,\
  \ and patiently because she wanted me to grasp some part of the depth, and holiness\
  \ that was taking place in this sacrificial act. \n   \u201CYakalin, an alfombra\
  \ is a beautiful thing. Yes, it may be made up of dyed sawdust, or flowers, or other\
  \ such things but it is more than that. We create something beautiful. It is not\
  \ an easy task, but we do this because it is a form of repentance in our Catholic\
  \ faith. We do this as penance. Holy week is here. Christ is crucified. We must\
  \ repent.\u201D \n A new resolve formed in me, I knelt down beside her to continue\
  \ working. \n              ***\n I stood looking at the completed alfombra - the\
  \ complicated patterns, the beautiful images that had been formed from nothing more\
  \ than dust \u2013 it was an incredible sight. I had a strong sense of accomplishment.\
  \ As I stood beside my family that was so different from me and yet the same, my\
  \ heart swelled with a sense of connection and belonging. We stood there and watched\
  \ as the processional passed by trampling our alfombra in seconds. All of the hard\
  \ work, all the beauty, lost in a moment."
