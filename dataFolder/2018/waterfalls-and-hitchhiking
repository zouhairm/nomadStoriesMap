Text: "I had been camping in the Karijini National Park in the Pilbara region of Western\
  \ Australia. I was keen to explore the rest of this beautiful region but the car\
  \ I was travelling in was in no shape to mix it with the corrugated and pothole\
  \ riddled roads. My solution was simple. I would hitchhike my way around to the\
  \ rest of the National Park.\n\nMy hitching seemed to be going off without a hitch,\
  \ pardon the pun. I had submersed myself into more pristine waterfalls in one day\
  \ than I could have ever hoped to see in a lifetime. The grin on my face was a testament\
  \ to living out a boyhood dream of exploring the ancient waterholes and falls without\
  \ a care in the world. The hypnotic blend of lines and textures through the red\
  \ ochre rock carved by underground springs and rain is something that I\u2019ll\
  \ remember forever.\n\nMy enthusiasm got the better of me however. I had lost track\
  \ of time and upon exiting a canyon to the carpark where I hoped to get another\
  \ ride, I saw that the sun was setting and the carpark was empty. With surprising\
  \ nonchalance I looked at my map and calculated the distance back to camp, a total\
  \ of 36 kilometres. I emptied the contents of my daypack to find a couple of muesli\
  \ bars and a just under a litre of water. In the relatively cooler conditions of\
  \ the setting Pilbara sun, I thought it was a feasible situation to walk back to\
  \ camp. So, off I went. One foot in front of the other down a dusty red road.\n\
  About an hour and half into my journey I heard the familiar rumble of a car approaching\
  \ over a crest, bouncing over the deep corrugated path. I hadn\u2019t even considered\
  \ anyone coming along at this hour and almost forgot to put my thumb out to catch\
  \ a ride. They pulled over and as I approached the door was flung open from the\
  \ inside as a courtesy.\n\n\u201CMain campsite mate?\u201D he called above the rattle\
  \ of the diesel engine. Heat poured from the underside of the vehicle congealing\
  \ me in a bubble of noise, sweat and dust. I nodded and smiled. \u201CJump in then!\u201D\
  \n\n\u201CWhat the hell are you doing out here at this time anyway?\u201D he probed\
  \ after a some time passed. I explained my situation and after a thinking about\
  \ for a moment or two he said \u201CVery cool. That\u2019s totally hard-core man.\
  \ Gnarly.\u201D\nI laughed to myself after realising that I had just been called\
  \ a hard-core, gnarly person. I got back to camp and was hit by a wave of fatigue\
  \ as the kilometres from the day sunk into my heavy legs. I was hungry and tired\
  \ but could not wipe the smile from ochre stained face."
