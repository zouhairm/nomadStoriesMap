Text: "The trip of a very special time starts with total randomness as I planned not\
  \ to go for it. Travelling is life and being passionate about it is a basic element\
  \ of life. Trip was never in the mind as I feel if not now there is always the next\
  \ time but often we miss down on the spot that actually there is no next time. I\
  \ stumbled upon travelling on this trip to Auroville, Pondicherry (India) planned\
  \ since the college days of architecture and yet due to several reasons it took\
  \ a backseat and never came a plan of success. A moment strikes out and it was a\
  \ time for all of us to go but due to wedding of my brother just before that and\
  \ several leaves knocked from the office I thought it won't be a possibility for\
  \ me to take this trip. Several days the last trip with a bunch of friends who were\
  \ soon going to depart was dangling in my mind. I was just rattled with the regret\
  \ that it will be the worst mistake of my life if I don't go. I booked the tickets\
  \ at the end moment, didn't travel with my friends but did manage a similar schedule\
  \ down. Luckily was fortunate to have many options from Mumbai-Chennai route and\
  \ then I started down the itinerary formation which is the most important thing\
  \ that i work down on.\nTouch down at the chennai airport we set on the journey\
  \ on the ECR (Eastern Coastal Road) route by hiring a self drive car sevice which\
  \ was a reliable option. Driving down by yourself pushes out all the barriers which\
  \ restrict your limitations and to go beyond. We drove down the route and found\
  \ multiple points and did take pit stops at them. A trip more than a conventional\
  \ tour & choosing to do what you love by breaking the rules of setting your parameters\
  \ is the true wanderlust. Alamparai fort and the lighthouse are the different discoveries\
  \ we made by connecting with the locals. Digital maps are the tools but the locals\
  \ are the supporting elements of update.\nWe reached the destination Auroville,\
  \ which is indeed a heaven with full of good people. Living in the country like\
  \ India, it was difficult to accept we belong to the same land as it was totally\
  \ differnt than any urban or rural space or even compared to any ultra modern town.\
  \ Identity of it's own which is a blend of French colonies to the ultimate architecture\
  \ monuments mesmerize you. The beaches with a perfect surfing experience and bliss\
  \ nature. Trying something new for the first is the innovation of the individual.\
  \ This trip applied to me in all the aspects. \nI made my choice, Did you? Plan\
  \ the Next."
