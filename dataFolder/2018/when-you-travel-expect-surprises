Text: "Sitting in the office and tapping on the mouse button to go through the day,\
  \ everyday until the weekends just to spend some time for yourself and this mundane\
  \ life gets you to plan for a travel to heal your tired soul and enrich your senses\
  \ with a little bit of reality and the life beyond the computer screen. \n\nWe dont\
  \ always plan it perfectly, and the best trips occur randomly. We might expect many\
  \ things yet one thing for sure is that we will be surprised by the real world and\
  \ more than once when you run towards it.\n\nThe place was \u2018Thengumarada\u2019\
  \ a reserve forest wherethe Tigers roam free and the Gazelles  forage on the open\
  \ plain with their eyes open for ever present danger. The thing about forest that\
  \ a city dweller might never realise is that it is vast, it can engulf you and you\u2019\
  ll never see the end of it. \n\nI realised it here, this was a forest in the outskirts\
  \ of Satyamangalam, sandwiched between Tamilnadu and the Mysore border. The forest\
  \ is very dense and known for the Tiger reserves, no vehicles are allowed and for\
  \ a city dweller like me its a chance to trek into the unknown, the possibilities\
  \ of having a glimpse at Tigers and Elephants gave me a rush. \n\nBut little did\
  \ I know, humans aren\u2019t the top gun in the forest. These wildlife are the major\
  \ powers and humans are just another intrusion in their domain. \n\n\u2018The last\
  \ thing I expected\u2019 was to see a dead boar near a secluded temple in the middle\
  \ of vast plain that streches into the trees and then to infinity. This is a temple\
  \ that is a little elevated from the plain and actually wirks as a wonderful perch\
  \ to overlook the fields if spotted deer, gazelles and some Bison. \n\nThe temple\
  \ used by both Tamilnadu and Karnataka farmers at festive times exclusively. The\
  \ temple give you the vibe that it questions your presense in that forest at that\
  \ time of the day as if you tresspassed into a holy place. \n\nSo apart from festive\
  \ times no one visits this temple and its closed and so a leapord became then tenant\
  \ of this temple. Who is the culprit of the boars death. There were some kids of\
  \ the age 8 and 10 respectively are goat farmers looking after around 100 goats\
  \ in the plains along with a dog to guide them.\n\nThis was my biggest surprise,\
  \ kids, tiny kids arent even 1/3rd my size rearing goats in the hunting plains of\
  \ Tigers, Leopards and Bears. They were the one who explained that it was a Leopard\
  \ that caused this and I asked them arent you afraid of this and they simply said.\
  \ \u201CWe go our own ways\u201D."
