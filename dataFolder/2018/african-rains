Text: "Travelling to Tarime is an adventure of its own kind, full of extreme contrasts.\
  \ It is a village forgotten by the rest of the world, however, it is the perfect\
  \ place to go if you are willing to forego the material \u2018necessities\u2019\
  \ that modern society has become so reliant on.\n\nEverything about Tarime was familiar;\
  \ the dirt, unrelenting heat and smiles of the locals.  One thing not familiar was\
  \ me. I was not the teenager that travelled here three years earlier. I was now\
  \ a young woman wanting to make a difference, hoping to empower women and girls\
  \ to take control of their futures.\n\nThere is a seriousness to life\u2019s day-to-day\
  \ struggles that, for me, was hard to comprehend. During our daily health clinics\
  \ malaria, worms, HIV and malnutrition were evident and unemployment is very real.\
  \ Yet somehow these resilient people manage to see each day as an opportunity, finding\
  \ the positive side to life.\n\nImbedded in my memory is my last day. An hour spent\
  \ travelling along the deeply rutted, potholed roads to the village of Bisarwi.\
  \ As we drew closer to the village, I noticed black clouds filling the sky. We arrived\
  \ just as the first few large drops fell. Tanzanians celebrate rain as it brings\
  \ life to wild places, ensuring crops, food and prosperity. \n\nAs the rain fell,\
  \ we spent two hours at the women\u2019s centre, teaching local women how to use\
  \ sanitary products supplied by the Days for Girls initiative, swapping stories,\
  \ laughing, stumbling through my use of Swahili. The head Mama, Rebecca, was unable\
  \ to speak English, but could understand it. Despite our language barrier we developed\
  \ a deep kinship instilled by our desire to improve the lives of others. Rebecca\
  \ is, in my mind, the true spirit of empowering women. During the three years since\
  \ my previous visit, the community had rapidly progressed, largely due to Rebecca\u2019\
  s authority and hard work. It gives me hope that everyone can make a difference\
  \ to improving their own lives.\n\nThere was a combination of moments during my\
  \ time in Tarime that made me feel as though I was making a difference to the community,\
  \ from being a guest at a high school graduation to delivering the education programs\
  \ and health supplies. It was not until that last day, though, marooned in the tin\
  \ shed at Bisarwi women\u2019s centre that I felt the deepest connections and, like\
  \ the African rain, felt as though I was contributing to a better future for these\
  \ women, by teaching them to believe and strive to reach their dreams."
