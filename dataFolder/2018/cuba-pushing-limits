Text: "What is it like to reach the maximum of your own capacity? In my opinion, you\
  \ never know until you actually reflect on the situation. You may not even realize\
  \ it in the moment you are living it. \nWhen I decided to take  a bike tour with\
  \ my friend's 58 year old mother through the Sierra Maestra in south east Cuba,\
  \ I did not realize that it was a decision that would push me to my personal and\
  \ physical limits. The great challenge was reconciling the image of Cuba, described\
  \ as a simple and beautiful landscape from our travel books versus the reality where\
  \ we were more concerned about searching for water we could drink. Due to the nescience\
  \ of what adventure would expect us, every day we were surprised by how crazy and\
  \ exhausting it was, and we never expected the following day would be even more\
  \ so. \nWe realized quickly that Cuba is still an isolated country. The bikes we\
  \ got were old and in poor condition and the only equipment was an oversized tire\
  \ inflator, which we carried on top of our baggage. Then came the heat. Being used\
  \ to cool and rainy climate, it was really a hard riding a bike in much hotter temperatures.\
  \ Of course we were aware of all these issues, and we knew that we were traveling\
  \ in a poor, socialist country with poor infrastructure and absolutely no mobile\
  \ signal. However, that is exactly what made it an adventure; finding our way, asking\
  \ people for the directions even though we both knew no Spanish. There were many\
  \ times when men told us that the way we wanted to go was too dangerous for us.\
  \ The reason they said that were the damaged streets that often consisted of stones\
  \ and pebbles. As I already mentioned, we once rode our bikes for a good 40 kilometers\
  \ with no bottled water until we found a pub in a small village that sold us coke.\
  \ There were times when the height and steepness of the mountains brought us to\
  \ our physical limit.\nWhat we got from all that, however, was one of the greatest\
  \ experiences one could make; making local connections, going through untouched\
  \ landscapes and being the only tourist far and wide. The culture, the people, \
  \ the mentality and the entire country are simply amazing. We cycled through villages\
  \ that I am sure will remain unseen by the majority of all tourists visiting Cuba.\
  \ We met the stereotypical old Cuban man with no teeth and a cigar in his mouth.\
  \ We experienced a country in its entire reality, we learned the importance of teamwork\
  \ and got to know another side of ourselves which we have not know before."
