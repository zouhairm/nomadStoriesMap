Text: "I closed my eyes. I could feel my toes sinking in the sand, wetted by the gentle\
  \ waves that pushed the sea over the shore. It had been a while, but the sea and\
  \ I had become sort of friends, even though looking at it now I could hardly recognize\
  \ it. Glowing in turquoise it danced in a range of shades that had me absolutely\
  \ captivated.\nJust less than a week before I had been dragging wood to feed the\
  \ chimney, I had cleared snow from the way, prepared tour boxes for the sledges\
  \ and even lost some peanuts to the ice. I had lived inside a picture of quietness\
  \ and stars but it all was being absorbed by the sounding life of Cape Verde\u2019\
  s Mindelo, where people lived the music in the street, dancing to the beat of drums.\n\
  A shadow approached me from behind and as I turned my head, I caught the glimpse\
  \ of a grin that lacked some of its teeth. It came to stand by my side and discovered\
  \ a dark face that smiled at me with friendly eyes. I smiled back. He pointed at\
  \ the sea, his question hanging at the top of one of his eyebrows, and I sighed.\
  \ \u201CNo\u201D I said, \u201Cnot yet.\u201D\nI had been staying for a couple of\
  \ days at Si Ma Bo\u2019s, a hostel run by a busy Italian woman who was fully engaged\
  \ on stray animals\u2019 protection. I had arrived shortly before Carnival, holding\
  \ a rather poorly planned reservation, to find most of the island already booked.\
  \ So she ended up welcoming me into her home.\nIt had taken me over 5 days and 3000\
  \ miles to get there, still I knew very little about Cape Verde. Mindelo had wondered\
  \ me with its rhythm, its music and people. But I was, in truth, waiting for a boat,\
  \ counting the days as they passed.\nIt was one early morning of clotted coffee\
  \ scent tickling under my nose, that I got a ride to the centre where the association\
  \ took care of most of the dogs. On the way back to town we hitched a light truck,\
  \ the hot air blowing on my skin, drying my hair in jumbled dust. No one said anything\
  \ till we jumped off at the market. But as we headed east on the road, my eyes caught\
  \ sight of an extremely familiar mast sticking out in the distance.\nMy stomach\
  \ took a leap, awaking my heart into furious bumps that threatened to break my chest.\
  \ I turned around and started babbling overexcited, trying to explain everyone that\
  \ they had finally arrived. And I run.\nI felt my feet brush the ground swift as\
  \ wind, propelling me as they weaved on the crowded street. I didn't care people\
  \ looking at me as I felt my face burst in joy. They were there, really there. And\
  \ again, I felt alive."
