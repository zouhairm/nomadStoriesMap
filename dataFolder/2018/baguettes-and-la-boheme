Text: "St. Miheil, France is a tiny village stuck back in time. It is seemingly a\
  \ one street town with a chevre, a local baker, and a community who is truly there\
  \ to support one another no matter the circumstance. When embarking on a trip to\
  \ this tiny town to work on a farm for a week I had no idea what to expect. When\
  \ telling people my final destination a majority have never heard of it, others\
  \ have heard of the region it is in, and only a handful knew is where the US had\
  \ their first major battle in WW1. When pinpointing a farm to work on in this region\
  \ I slowly realized how difficult it was to actually get there. I flew into Paris,\
  \ took a train to Meuse, took a \"bus\" to an abandoned restaurant, and from there\
  \ a beat up car drove up with a man with dreads down his back and French reggae\
  \ blaring from the speakers pulled up. I knew in my gut that was my contact from\
  \ the farm. From that moment, that journey I knew I was in for a wild week. La Brouette\
  \ is a locally run brewery started by three local Frenchmen. They wanted to create\
  \ a space away from the hustle and bustle of society, live off the land, and create\
  \ a beer that can be enjoyed by the community. It was during this trip that I got\
  \ an inside look into the lives of the French countryside that many would overlook\
  \ upon their stay. Staying in a renovated firetruck it was a time that I was able\
  \ to disconnect from the materialistic world that may at times come with the French\
  \ culture. During my week at this farm I was able to work in a farm house from the\
  \ mid 1800s and turned the cellar into a bar and dance hall. St. Mihiel is a region\
  \ known for their wine. They are known for their migrant farmers. They are known\
  \ for their \"la boheme\" mentality. Being able to go to a home full of these transient\
  \ farmers, sharing a potluck meal, wine from the region, and erupt in dancing and\
  \ singing with complete strangers. I was surrounded by people from all over Europe\
  \ with a common goal. They wanted to chase an easy going life. They wanted to work\
  \ in a field that made their soul excited. They wanted to forego the stresses of\
  \ society. \nTraveling can lead you to a wide variety of places. Whether you are\
  \ ready to live the life of luxury on a resort or get your hands dirty on vacation,\
  \ the world is open and ready for you."
