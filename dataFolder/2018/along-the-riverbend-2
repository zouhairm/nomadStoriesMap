Text: "January in Laos is creepingly cold. It hits you without you even knowing it\
  \ before you're so cold that the only thing to do is drink adult beverages. We're\
  \ a group of maybe 15 people, all huddled together on this very large and drafty\
  \ slow boat down the Mekong river, on our way to a village far away from everything.\
  \  \nAfter about 6 hours we stop alongside the steep hillside in the murky waters,\
  \  it reminds me of angry chocolate milk if milk could have feelings. Soon we hear\
  \ footsteps and suddenly there are 7 kids waving and shouting towards us, seeming\
  \ curious but cautious. We all emerge from the boat and make our way up the hillside,\
  \ our guide speaking in Lao to the village chief and paying his respects. \nWe are\
  \ greeted with a tour around the village school, Buddhist monasteries and chicken\
  \ coops. Later on, after we have chucked our bags in the huts provided for us, boys\
  \ and girls separated, we attend a lovely feast of a meal; Tonnes of perfectly cooked\
  \ rice, fish stew with chilli and Mekong whisky. Bliss. Even though they didn't\
  \ speak more than a few words English, and we not much more Lao, we had a wonderful\
  \ time at the table. Children and chickens playing around the table, the elders\
  \ knitting and laughing their broad toothless smiles. \nBut the very best must be\
  \ the sky. No light pollution, nothing for hours on end. Without me noticing, the\
  \ whole village had left the table and started preparing a ceremony. Everyone in\
  \ the travel pack sat down on a beautifully knitted mat on the ground, surrounded\
  \ by the elderly ladies in the village. The chieftan brought out a giant centrepiece\
  \ decorated with candles and incense, humming in his low but demanding voice. I\
  \ was truly taken aback at this moment, maybe it was the unfamiliarity or maybe\
  \ the whisky, either way, it was something I'll remember for the rest of my life.\
  \  \nThe elderly women surround us in a circle, singing an enchanting song, they\
  \ go one by one to each and every one of us and gives us a white cotton band around\
  \ both wrists. When they stop singing I think I had 14 on each arm. Symbolizing\
  \ good deeds, purity, and love for one another.  We thank them dearly \"Kop chai\
  \ lai lai\", and head to the huts for a long rest. \nCook-a-doodle-doo! Rise and\
  \ shine say the rooster standing two feet away from my head. Barely awake we find\
  \ the village buzzing with life, even though the sun just got up. After a wonderful\
  \ warm breakfast, we part with the village but leave with fond memories and 28 new\
  \ bracelets."
