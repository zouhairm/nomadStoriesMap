Text: "I saw the sky. I couldn't register the magnificence of the image but I couldn't\
  \ take away my eyes either. With a backdrop of bright orange, stood a beautiful\
  \ cloud formation of what seemed to be a lion and a deer in intimate proximity.\
  \ They were probably a million miles away, yet the details were intricately great.\
  \ The clouds formed a slanting cliff over which the lion stood facing the tip of\
  \ the slope. The deer faced the lion, looking up at it, their snouts almost touching.\
  \ In the small gap between these two animals in such a brilliant frame, was the\
  \ setting sun glorifying the scene with its gleaming rays. The blue in the surrounding\
  \ vastness made this the universe\u2019s artistic frame. I stood there with a smile\
  \ on my face, a smile that didn't seem to fade. It might have well been just another,\
  \ \"look around you and you will see the beauty of this Earth\", day but this wasn't.\
  \ It was extraordinary, true, but I also felt it say something. Had I seen a deer\
  \ and a lion in a single frame before? Yes. But most of the pictures depicted the\
  \ art of preying or bring preyed upon. Most pictures holding the two animals depicted\
  \ vulnerability, pride, fear and inequality. But this work of art in the sky was\
  \ a work of honor, a frame of balance. It was as if the deer looked right into the\
  \ eyes of the lion and held its pride, and the lion looked right into the deer's\
  \ eyes and acknowledged its right. That's when it dawned on me, the law of the universe.\
  \ The deer held love, the lion held love, the act of eating and being eaten were\
  \ also governed by love. It was the process that validated the union of them both,\
  \ for now each contained a part of the other and they became one. Isn't this the\
  \ universal law of love? All is one and one is all. This solid sight formed by the\
  \ fragile clouds, so uncertain yet so detailed, highlighted the working of this\
  \ world which can be described in just one word, 'purpose'. The deer has its purpose,\
  \ so does the lion. The deer doesn't look at itself as the victim, nor does the\
  \ lion see in it a king. The differentiation lies in the eyes of the beholder, a\
  \ race that has forgotten to pay heed to what lies within. The lion respects the\
  \ life of the deer, and the deer, the lion's. One doesn't fear the other; they only\
  \ concern themselves with their soul's purpose. Man doesn't see love, he only sees\
  \ the difference. The last thing I expected was to learn from the sky, if man finds\
  \ his soul's purpose he will also know respect. Respect is love and love is within."
