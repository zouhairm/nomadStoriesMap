Text: "Her body glowed under the warmth of the setting sun as she gazed across the\
  \ water to the brightly lit skyline of Udaipur, the Venice of India. Alone, and\
  \ just like me, she seemed to be looking for something. \u201CWhere you from?\u201D\
  , I asked. She turned, saw my dorky glasses and nervous smile and grinned, \u201C\
  I\u2019m actually from here\u201D. With a cheeky smile, she took me through a night\
  \ that is now a blur of images: speeding tuk-tuks, a complete 50-piece Rajasthani\
  \ dinner, marionettes, smoking some pot sold from a guy behind a random closed shop\
  \ on a deserted street and drunken singing along the water to old Hindi film songs.\
  \ \n      I don\u2019t remember the details of the food or places or things. I do\
  \ remember she was beautiful in this white dress that got her an uncomfortable amount\
  \ of attention she brushed off with a laugh. Her hair had blond streaks as if the\
  \ sun had reached down and stroked her head. She was stubborn and laughed at her\
  \ friend\u2019s advice not to go out alone as a female at night in India, willing\
  \ the world to meet her wants rather than bend to its realities. But what I remember\
  \ most was how under the warmth and comfort of the blanket in my hotel room she\
  \ told me of how tired she got of fighting the box she was put into as a female,\
  \ the pressure from her family and community to get married and have kids and her\
  \ own locked up insecurities of how she seemed to be behind compared to her friends\
  \ and should care but didn\u2019t. \n       It should have been shocking. We were\
  \ so familiar, so comfortable, we knew each other\u2019s problems and we knew them\
  \ well because they were our own. I don\u2019t know what she had been looking for\
  \ initially that night as she looked out over the water. Looking at reflections\
  \ can set the mind at ease; I think that\u2019s what we found."
