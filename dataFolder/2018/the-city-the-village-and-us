Text: "The city the village and Us\n\nThere is no speed limit to the growth of our\
  \ time or to the roads of Saidwal, a small village in Punjab. The journey was tiresome\
  \ and I lost my back to the cracks on the road which lie as the broken promises\
  \ of the previous politician and the ticket to the next one.\n \nMy granny held\
  \ my hand and as we walked around this town which even Google didn\u2019t register.\
  \  I reconciled with her as the sun was piercing our bodies and I was toiling to\
  \ keep my white shirt white. The air was dusty, there were no road or no traffic\
  \ lights, animals and humans sat under the same shade, kids kept playing in the\
  \ mud. The temple was kept cleaner than the hospital and in the school the broken\
  \ blackboard had turned white with the chalk residue. There walls were filled with\
  \ student graffiti and only one bench was kept for the teacher.\n\nBefore much I\
  \ do, a pass-byre stopped by, he ran and touched my granny\u2019s feet. My granny\
  \ rose to the occasion and smiled as if she had graduated first in her class.This\
  \ unknown province now reflected a sense of familiarity. The heat was still there\
  \ and I was sweating profusely but my senses had disappeared over looking this overwhelming\
  \ situation.  \nI was walked into a small house. The walls were cracked and every\
  \ corner was marked by a spider\u2019s web, as if they were kept as pets. On one\
  \ corner was the kitchen where the food was being cooked using cow dung. \n\nMy\
  \ granny stood next to this small plant which was situated right in the middle of\
  \ the house, where the sun rays settled.  A tear dropped my granny\u2019s face,\
  \ as she saw the name of my grandfather still minted on the slab. She held my hand\
  \ and turned towards me, this was our house, the cracks on the walls are from the\
  \ time of partition, which still hadn\u2019t fused. The city lights have over shadowed\
  \ the past but this is where we belong. The new owner had maintained the plant to\
  \ reminisce my grandfather, who fought the war. The owner asked his wife to offer\
  \ us some fruits, she whispered back to him. That year the season was dry for the\
  \ farmers, yet they offered whatever they had, their plates were empty yet they\
  \ fed us. \n\nThey were called villagers but they were more human than us. Their\
  \ faces were getting dark as the rays started to scatter and in that scattered dust\
  \ laid my scattered past. \nWe left an envelope to which he might have smiled and\
  \ had a better night than day."
