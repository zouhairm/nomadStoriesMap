Text: "There were 12 Australian students, 4 Malaysian students, 4 teachers and the\
  \ professor's maid, all staying in a three-bedroom house. There were 4 beds. The\
  \ students, we slept like sardines, squashed together, top, tail, tail and top,\
  \ holding onto each other so we didn't slip off the edge. The maid slept on the\
  \ tiled floor, no spare pillows for her head. The Malaysian students were grateful\
  \ they had been allowed to come.\nIt was, like every other night, hot. It was stifling.\
  \ Even if there had been a fly screen and the window open, there was no breeze to\
  \ ripple the air. We woke up with frizzy hair and longed for cold showers. We ate\
  \ rice for breakfast - thankfully, cold. If it had been hot, my digestive system\
  \ would have broiled itself. \nThe morning was the coolest part of the whole day.\
  \ I sat outside, on the edge of the bay, book in one hand, sunscreen tube in the\
  \ other. Children played with rubbish in the ocean, tossing it to each other like\
  \ toys and screaming when seaweed floated past. \nWe were tasked with dinner, but\
  \ we weren't allowed in the kitchen. That was the maid's domain. Full of protest,\
  \ we tried to enter, time and time again. She shooed us away. She took knives from\
  \ our hands and sliced the potatoes at the speed of light. She crushed cardamom\
  \ with sheer brute strength and rinsed sweet corn with ease. This was her time to\
  \ shine. We lit the barbeque, apparently wrong, so she re-lit it and stoked the\
  \ flames, all the while ushering us out the kitchen and into lounge chairs.\n\"\
  I offered her my pillow last night,\" Daniel told me. \"But she refused to take\
  \ it. I told her Lachlan and I would share, and anyway, at least I had a mattress,\
  \ but she wouldn't. She pretended to be asleep so I couldn't give it to her.\"\n\
  The teachers lounged around, perfectly at ease. They watched us meander down to\
  \ the shore and come back red and blistering some hours later. They scolded us for\
  \ being so bare when we should have covered up. They kept track of who won the card\
  \ games and occasionally talked about work. They reminded us of our assignments,\
  \ and when dinner was ready - the dinner we were supposed to have cooked - the table\
  \ was dragged over into their corner so they wouldn't have to exert themselves so\
  \ much in the heat. \nAir conditioning never felt so good when we got back to the\
  \ student hostel, and we slept easy knowing that everyone had their own beds and\
  \ their own pillows once more."
