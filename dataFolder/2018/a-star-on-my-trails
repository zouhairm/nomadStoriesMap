Text: "I stood transfixed, at the edge of a frigid, swirling mass of madness that\
  \ was the Rani river. The majestic ice-tipped Himalayas looked over my shoulder,\
  \ seemingly uninterested in this fantastic twilight view, perhaps having seen it\
  \ all. A cold draft blew across the clearing, straying over our tents and rustling\
  \ the luminescent silver birch on the forest edge.\n\nA cackling laugh pulled me\
  \ out of my reverie. \n\n\u201CJump\u201D, he cheered at the crowd wildly, as the\
  \ cold gushing Rani swallowed him up to his waist, fed on a steady diet of freshly\
  \ melted snow.\n\nBundled up in thick layers and wary of the icy conclusion, his\
  \ audience only looked on reluctantly. \n\nHaving succeeded in getting all eyes\
  \ on him, he guffawed promptly and dunked his head below the surface as others could\
  \ only gander in amazement and broke out into applause.\n\nTiger, everyone named\
  \ him - the moniker perhaps drawn from a close resemblance to a movie star of the\
  \ world\u2019s largest film industry, Bollywood.\n\nHe had a Sufiesque air about\
  \ him - long serpentine lengths of hair parted neatly off his forehead and wild\
  \ brown eyes that you couldn\u2019t stand up to in a stare-off. \n\nOnce, when people\
  \ hustled for the shared warmth of the dining tent, he spoke of the times gone by,\
  \ and the rapid change he had observed in the Kullu valley.\n\nHe reminisced sitting\
  \ cross-legged on the ground as his Nana weaved incredible stories of his fishing\
  \ for trout in the cold Himalayan waters, a profession Tiger once hoped to pursue\
  \ when he grew up.\n\nHe noted, with dark resentment in his voice, that one could\
  \ now simply \u2018catch\u2019 trout in one of the many commercial trout farms that\
  \ lined the winding roads leading up to Manali.\n\nDenied his dream, he ran away\
  \ from his village home, but returned, several years wiser. Though he stayed away\
  \ now, working as a guide for the thriving trek business in the valley, he visited\
  \ them often. \n\nTiger had a penchant for theatrics. Often, he would abruptly break\
  \ into song, most from his pahadi origin, which, although strange sounding, had\
  \ a rather mellifluous tone to them. Of course, he expected the applause, loud and\
  \ unrestrained.\n\nTaaliyon ki kami nahi honi chahiye, he would declare.\nLet the\
  \ applause continue.\n\nHe performed for his admirers. His chose his stage, his\
  \ moments and much like most performers, revelled in their applause.\n\nPerhaps\
  \ that was his life\u2019s philosophy. Simple, unrestrained.\n\nHe was often a showman,\
  \ sometimes, a philosopher, and in his spare time, a guide to the mystic terrains\
  \ of the Himalayas."
