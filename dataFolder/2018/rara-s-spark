Text: "\"Do you happen to have a spare fuel canister?\" an older woman asked me, as\
  \ I approached my car in the dirt parking lot. \n\"Yes, I do!\" I replied. \n\"\
  My friend just left for the day, taking my fuel with her on accident, and I really\
  \ love to enjoy my morning coffee.\" \n\"I was just about to boil some water for\
  \ myself actually, please, join me.\"\nThe woman left to retrieve her things, and\
  \ returned with a bounce in her step.\n\"You don't understand how much I appreciate\
  \ this, my morning coffee is my ritual.\"\n\"It's no problem, I would've been making\
  \ hot water by myself, if it weren't for you. What is your name?\"\n\"My name is\
  \ RaRa\" the woman replied. \n\"RaRa! What a fantastic name! I'm Birdie. RaRa and\
  \ Birdie, it sounds like we were meant to be friends!\" \nWe both chuckled. \n\n\
  From the few minutes following our introduction, I gathered that RaRa was likely\
  \ what my friends had referred to as a \u201CDesert Rat\u201D\u2014not exactly a\
  \ \u201Chomeless\u201D person, but rather someone who staked primitive and free\
  \ camping grounds as their \u201Chome.\u201D People who roamed from place to place\
  \ with minimal needs, who lived freely, and took pleasure in the beauty of daily\
  \ life.\n\nAs we waited for the water to boil, RaRa asked me what brought me here.\
  \ An \u201Cunexpected journey\u201D I called it, since I came to California for\
  \ a five-day vacation with my sister, and was still there, two weeks later, by myself.\
  \ As we sat and talked, I learned more about myself by trying to answer her question\
  \ of what I was doing there and what I wanted to do with my time. I said I wanted\
  \ to write, and conveyed that saying this aloud to her and to others, was still\
  \ a new, and frightening concept to me. I looked into RaRa\u2019s eyes, surrounded\
  \ by a tan line created from her sunglasses, and told her how I felt like a blooming\
  \ flower, looking forward to finally showing the world my bright colored petals,\
  \ offering them to smell my fragrance, inviting others to visit and help pollinate\
  \ the world around me. \n\nRaRa shook her bottle of coffee creamer, and upon examining\
  \ it, she said, \u201CWow, it really froze, huh?\u201D \n\u201COh, Yeah!\u201D I\
  \ laughed. I laughed hard. It was the kind of laugh that transgresses only when\
  \ the beauty of a moment catches in sync with the rhythm of your heartbeat and sings\
  \ with it. It was perfectly delightful in the way that she cherished what was, and\
  \ so I laughed and shared in her delight. \n\nAlthough I provided RaRa with fuel\
  \ that morning, she ignited a spark in me that I would carry for the rest of my\
  \ journey. I was ready to bloom."
