Text: "My name is Erind Mustafaraj. I'm a 27 and a little bit years old boy from Elbasan\
  \ Albania.I have always been attracted from traveling around and discovering new\
  \ customs and traditions of different countries . Their history and the way they\
  \ everyday life are the main part ofmy  interest . Serbia was the first country\
  \ where I traveled alone. Maybe you know that Albanian and Serbian relations hasn't\
  \ been so good in the past because their history, conflict, Kosovo war etc. It is\
  \ a situation surrounded with hate , disbelief and insecurity. I would compare my\
  \ travels to Serbia, with a \"Four Seasons\" pizza.Yummy.I have been in Serbia three\
  \ times; Belgrade (summer 2015),Sremski karlovski (winter 2015) and Mali Idjos (autumn\
  \ 2016)and I\u2019m so exiting to visit it again and to complete 'my pizza ' with\
  \ the spring 'ingredients. The best part is that every time I visited it I have\
  \ travelled in three different ways  plane , bus and train ) and it has been amazing.\
  \ My first 'Meeting' with Serbia was in June 2015 and it was a love with the first\
  \ sight. I travelled with plane and it was so close from Tirana Airport as my brother\
  \ joked with me telling that I would be in Belgrade before he gets back home. Belgrade\
  \ was amazing (first impact ,because it is still amazing). It was a place when you\
  \ can meet history, you can dance with different types of music, meet nice people\
  \ that are curious for your origin and impressions and taste different traditional\
  \ food and drink.(Anyway I will not forget my mom checking all my clothes before\
  \ I packed , to see if there was something written on them that would put my life\
  \ in dangerous )  In December 2015 I visited Serbia again. Sremski Karlovski panorama\
  \ was beyond imagination. A lovely small town with an amazing architectural style\
  \ and with a dense fog cold day. I think that a costume of the 1800s would fit perfectly\
  \ fine those days. Last but not the least, train journey in September 2016 with\
  \ Balkan express from Skopje  I couldn\u2019t had a better way to travel to Serbia.\
  \ I was like the time was stock and I was traveling back on time with this \u2018\
  steel time machine\u2019 in a country with different minorities community and traditions.\
  \ This old fashion train was my \u2018time machine\u2019 and I was lucky to catch\
  \ it on time. I'm barely waiting to discover what the fourth experience in Serbia\
  \ would bring for me. Why not even a \u2018\u2019dessert\u2019\u2019 would be great\
  \ . But till then , let\u2019s focus to find my ingredients for spring season."
