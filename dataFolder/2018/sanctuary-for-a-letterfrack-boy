Text: "Enveloped in fog, a white-washed building came into view. Then, a steeple with\
  \ a solitary grey bell. Cool mist trailed over emerald hills and damp curls framed\
  \ my face. Ireland in January.\n\nInside St. Joseph's Church were ten rows of wooden\
  \ pews outlined by dark green carpet. A man was seated in the back row, his silver\
  \ hair slick. He held a red baseball cap.\n\n\u201CAlright?\u201D he said, his greeting\
  \ sung with an Irish lilt. Deep-set creases lined his brow. \u201CJohn Dunne,\u201D\
  \ he said, and when he shook my hand, his grip was firm, his palm callused.\n\n\
  He told me he grew up in Letterfrack. At four years old, the district court sent\
  \ him here, to St. Joseph's Industrial School, where he remained until his 16th\
  \ birthday. Thousands of young boys were ordered to industrial schools all over\
  \ Ireland for being destitute, lacking proper guardianship, or for committing petty\
  \ crimes. \u201CI was one of the youngest,\u201D he told me. \u201CI suppose that\
  \ made me lucky. I never really knew what family life was like. My life just, was\
  \ the way it was.\u201D Later, I learned that 2,819 boys had lived at St. Joseph's\
  \ Industrial School from 1887-1974.\n\nRun by the Congregation of Christian Brothers,\
  \ the school was meant to instill the boys with Catholic values and prepare them\
  \ for skilled labor. John's days were strictly regimented and always supervised.\
  \ \u201CWe had lessons every weekday, for school and catechism. But, it was hard\
  \ to learn. We were in constant fear of being punished, often at random and without\
  \ reason. Maybe it was for acting out in class or getting a question wrong. We'd\
  \ get the strap for that. Six or seven lashes on the hand or backside.\u201D John\
  \ winced. \u201CEighteen inches of thick leather, beautifully sewn, the handle tucked\
  \ into the robe of every monk.\u201D He blinked. \u201CBut, it was the way it was.\u201D\
  \ In the early 2000's, accounts of excessive physical and sexual abuse by the monks\
  \ were made public.\n\nHis gaze fell on the stained glass icons above the marble\
  \ alter. \u201CBut, I found sanctuary here,\u201D he said. \u201CAt mass, it felt\
  \ like I really had a mother. I found comfort and peace in this place. I still do.\u201D\
  \n\nNot far from the church, I found the Letterfrack Industrial School Graveyard.\
  \ Heart-shaped stones etched with hand-painted roses marked the burials of 78 of\
  \ the 147 boys that died there. Next to the wrought-iron gate, a simple, engraved\
  \ plaque reads: \u201CWhat they suffered they told but few, they did not deserve\
  \ what they went through, tired and weary they made no fuss, they tried so hard\
  \ to stay with us.\u201D"
