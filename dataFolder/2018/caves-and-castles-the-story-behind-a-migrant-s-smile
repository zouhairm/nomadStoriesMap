Text: "To my back, a medieval fortress wall, ahead, a panorama stretching from the\
  \ city of Granada to the distant Sierra Nevada Mountains marching up to the clouds.\
  \ Dominating the view is the Alhambra: stronghold, sprawling palace, and a bona\
  \ fide UNESCO gem.  \n\nI pulled out my mobile and snapped a pic, but it was blurry,\
  \ so I delved into my bag for my camera, but I still couldn\u2019t do it justice.\
  \ This moment\u2019s beauty was designed to be fleeting, and for eyes to behold,\
  \ rather than lenses. \n\nYou\u2019d be forgiven if you thought I was on prime Spanish\
  \ real estate. On the contrary, the best view in the city belongs to the refugees,\
  \ gypsies, and hippies who call the caves of the hill home. We had gone up to meet\
  \ some African migrants living there. Fires smoldered, guitars strummed flamenco,\
  \ and youths howled over beers. This place had pulse and grit. \n\n\u201CFreddy,\u201D\
  \ our contact, popped out from a crowd of men and welcomed us inside his cave. This\
  \ is his travel story as much as it\u2019s mine. He bid us relax. I tried to\u2026\
  \ but there was nothing remotely relaxing to sit on: broken couches, a mattress\
  \ on the ground, and somehow an old TV and a fridge (illegally rigged up to the\
  \ city powerlines). This was real poverty, yet him and his mates were so generous.\
  \ Everything was shared; bread, beer, and laughs. \n\nI\u2019ll never forget my\
  \ conversation with Freddie, a man who spoke about his cave as if it were a castle.\
  \ He had fled the Congo when he was young, his father didn\u2019t want him becoming\
  \ a child miner, digging coltan. He then braved the ocean and made it to Spain by\
  \ boat. Now he makes a living selling dope and knock-off Nikes to tourists. Ironically,\
  \ Freddy ended up in a cave anyway. \u201CAt least I didn\u2019t have to dig this\
  \ one,\u201D he joked. \n\nColtan is a mineral key to building anything with a lithium-ion\
  \ battery, aka my mobile and my camera. Civil war revolves around it, and Freddy\
  \ is a refugee because of it. Never before had I met someone so impacted by the\
  \ simple luxuries of life. I was used to seeing economic migrants on the news, I\
  \ just wasn\u2019t used to them having smiles on their faces.\n\nIlluminated, the\
  \ Alhambra stood like a beacon, ripe for the perfect Insta shot. Freddy knew what\
  \ he had, and it wasn\u2019t just a cave with a view. It was community, drumbeats\
  \ and deep talks, and it was home. I still wanted a pic, but as fate would have\
  \ it my battery was dead - what a sick joke. It made me think. How many families\
  \ were broken assembling my camera? \u2026 Just what does it take to turn a cave\
  \ into a castle?"
