Text: "Wagging tails and licking paws has never caught my fancy. I can never go to\
  \ homes where they are a part of the family. Insensitive? I know! Cynophobia was\
  \ one of the first phobia-related words I learnt in the English language. Naturally,\
  \ my instincts were to stay far away from them. \n\nLast year in August, my husband\
  \ (Neel) and I visited the Dalai Lama temple complex in McLeodgunj, a hill station\
  \ in Himachal Pradesh, Northern India. While coming back from the monastery, we\
  \ saw a group of young boys feeding two dogs. I changed my path to avoid going past\
  \ them. Suddenly,  we heard a shriek. One of the boys had been bitten by a dog.\
  \ The rest of group immediately rushed him to a health centre to get him a vaccination.\n\
  I had received a lot of flak from Neel in the past for being scared of them.\" Do\
  \ you understand now why am I cynophobic?\" I asked him. He merely nodded his head\
  \ in reply.\n \nThe next day we were in Khajjiar, a hill station nestled in the\
  \ lap of Dhauladhar range, a lesser chain of the mighty Himalayas and cedar trees.\
  \ We lodged ourselves in a small guest house. The climb to the lodge was quite steep\
  \ and used up a lot of energy.\nHere, I saw a dog sitting at the entrance.\"Not\
  \ again!\" I thought. \"It is domesticated, won't harm you\" said our host. A little\
  \ embarrassed, I said that am scared of them.\n \nAfter savoring the local delicacies\
  \ in the meadow, it was time to go up to our room. It was beginning to get dark\
  \ soon. Afraid of losing our way, we began to hurry up. We had run out of our phone\
  \ charge and were not carrying a torch. All of the sudden, lights went out and the\
  \ village was enveloped in darkness. We stood still, panicking and feeling in awe\
  \ of the place at the same time. While our eyes adjusted itself, we heard footsteps\
  \ approaching us. I turned around to see the same dog! It walked past us and stopped\
  \ ahead. Time stood still and ticking of seconds on my wrist watch turned into minutes.\
  \ \"This way, come on\" said Neel. I nudged myself in that direction. When we reached\
  \ where the dog was, we saw it jump up further and stopped again! I was confused,\
  \ was this a sign? After about half an hour, we reached our lodge. As if by magic,\
  \ the lights came back on!  We saw the dog go up to its master in bravado. Our host\
  \ patted its back and ascertained his affection for him. \" See, he did a good job!\
  \ He brought you back safely, isn't it?\" \nAt that very moment it dawned upon me\
  \ that what he said was true! \nA dog is after all, man's most loyal companion."
