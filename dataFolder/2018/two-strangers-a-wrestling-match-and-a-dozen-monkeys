Text: "When you roll into a small indian town, with a flat tyre on the cusp on a long\
  \ hot day, you might feel a little unsure of how things will work out.\n\nI\u2019\
  d ridden about a mile on the handlebars of the Royal Enfield Ravi had lent us, but\
  \ for the last 100 metres decided it better to jog alongside my parter and all our\
  \ bags. That\u2019s how I arrived - sweaty, sooty and unsure. \n\nWe\u2019d been\
  \ told about a mechanic and where to find him, but our trust had somewhat waned\
  \ after experiencing our first week in India. We found a small shop, open-fronted\
  \ with wheels stacked along one side, and a wizened face perched on a welder. \n\
  \n\u201CHello. Are you the mechanic?\u201D \n\nWatching our approach, the man met\
  \ our eyes slowly and carefully. He beckoned us to follow him, so we parked the\
  \ bike strapped under all of our belongings (and passports), alighted and climbed\
  \ a precariously placed ladder to the roof of the building. \n\nFrom the unofficial\
  \ second story we saw 3-500 people in a paddock, encircling a muddy patch. This\
  \ was the grand stadium for the annual national wrestling tour and the current location\
  \ of the mechanic. Two strangers passing by, seeing westerners crouched and confused\
  \ on top of a building, invited us for a closer look. Now, when you\u2019re new\
  \ to India, new to a town, and recently the fool in a scam, it\u2019s quite hard\
  \ to walk away from all of your possessions in search of a mechanic at a wrestling\
  \ match.  But curiosity and lack of options prevailed. \n\nThe dusk air was scented\
  \ with wet mud, spice and distant burning plastic. Colourfully dressed boys pounded\
  \ a heartbeat on hand drums. Huge mud-smeared men in small red pants tackled each\
  \ other to the floor. Despite trying our best to blend in, the wall of cheering,\
  \ peering people, seemingly spontaneously gathered, parted as we arrived. Before\
  \ we knew what was going on, an announcement had apparently been made on the tannoy;\
  \ \n\n\u201CCan the mechanic, fix the white people\u2019s tyre?\u201D\n\nAdd embarrassed\
  \ and slightly overwhelmed to sweaty, sooty and unsure. Even the wrestlers were\
  \ surveying us. \n\nA whirlwind of being passed around, of posing for photos and\
  \ blank, curious stares brought us face to face with Sharma. Like a mayor, he was\
  \ also the owner of the garage. Insisting we stay with him and his family, he fed\
  \ us, shared his prime Jack Daniels and we spoke long about India, travelling, wrestling\
  \ and the monkeys that poach his mangos.\n\nIn one evening this beautiful family\
  \ replenished our trust. We left with a full tyre and a full heart."
