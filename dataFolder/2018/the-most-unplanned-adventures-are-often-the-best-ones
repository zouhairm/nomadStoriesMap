Text: "Toronto a multicultural city, the city where a young man\xB4s dream came true.\
  \ \nI was in Toronto studying English, and I made many amazing friends from different\
  \ countries: Nina from Taiwan, Pad from Thailand and Ree from Japan. One day my\
  \ friends and I were studying and a classmate showed us pictures of a place called\
  \ Tobermory. This place is known for its beautiful natural views, vibrant wildness\
  \ and beautiful beaches with crystal water. All of us got the same idea: we all\
  \ have to go to that place no matter what. Pad suggested we rent a car, and we all\
  \ agreed it was a good idea.\nNext weekend, we went to pick up the car, but Pad\
  \ forgot her Thai license. She lived on the other side of the city, so we had to\
  \ go all the way back to her house get her license.\nWe went back in the afternoon\
  \ to pick up the car, but this time with her license. My friend Pad did not realize\
  \ that in Canada people drive on the left side but in her country she drives on\
  \ the right side. Some time later she figured out how to drive and we got on the\
  \ road. \nFour hours later, we arrived in Tobermory. Because of the delay getting\
  \ the license, we arrive late at night and could not visit any of the places. While\
  \ we were walking I said to my friends that I didn\xB4t want to go back to Toronto\
  \ without sightseeing and swimming, Nina said that it was a bad idea because she\
  \ didn\xB4t have enough money to stay in a hotel and neither did I, but I suggested\
  \ that maybe we could park the car in a free parking lot and sleep inside, so we\
  \ did. Nobody could sleep well because of the cold. \nNext morning, we went to all\
  \ the places around Tobermory. We took many pictures. We hiked, swam and to top\
  \ it all off, I jumped from a cliff to the water. It was awesome. \nMy friends and\
  \ I did not expect how amazing this trip was going to be. We had just taken the\
  \ best trip ever, and my friends and I soon realized that day that the most unplanned\
  \ adventures are often the best ones. Even if something bad happens, you can still\
  \ having fun if you are surrounded by your friends."
