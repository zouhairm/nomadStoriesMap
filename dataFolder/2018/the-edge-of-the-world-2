Text: "Real live puffins.\nAs adorable as the animated kind, puffins flock the base\
  \ of the Cliffs of Moher. They swoop over ferries and huddle atop the rock formations\
  \ that shoot up from the sea. \nPuffins are one of many unexpected things about\
  \ County Clare, Ireland, a place awarded the CIE Award of Excellence for the ninth\
  \ year running for its Cliffs of Moher Visitor Center. The popularity of the cliffs\
  \ dwarfs the area\u2019s other wonders, so most people stop in and head out within\
  \ a matter of hours, unaware of what else waits to be explored. \nIn addition to\
  \ the ferry, biking the Aran Islands, touring a farm, crashing a cliff tour, and\
  \ exploring the coast top my list of things that made our week in County Clare.\
  \ \n1. Harry Potter Cave\nSailing past the Cliffs of Moher, we caught sight of a\
  \ familiar scene for diehard Potter fans: the cave where Voldemort hid Slytherin\u2019\
  s locket. Though there were no inferi beneath the waves, it was magical to think\
  \ Harry had stood nearby awaiting his destiny.\n2. Aran Islands\nA Doolin Ferry\
  \ package let us explore the largest island and enjoy the boat around the cliffs.\
  \ We spent the day exploring every inch of the stone wall maze constructed by Irish\
  \ farmers in the 20th century. We found cottages, a beached shipwreck, and even\
  \ a friendly dolphin, making our day a very successful one. \n3. Touring the Farm\n\
  Part of our Cliffs of Moher day trip, our group toured a nearby farm, where we were\
  \ instructed in local plant life, permitted to pet the livestock, and taught more\
  \ about the land of Ireland itself. To top it off, the farm\u2019s caf\xE9 sold\
  \ treats made with the resources produced there\u2014a delicious way to start the\
  \ day.\n4. Crashing a Cliff Tour\nThe best accidental thing I\u2019ve ever done.\
  \ On a morning cliff hike, we got caught on a narrow path behind a tour group led\
  \ by a Doolin native. The man who owned the land had been hosting tours for years,\
  \ taking them over after his father, who took them after his father. He welcomed\
  \ us to join them, and we heard stories of his childhood spent swimming in underwater\
  \ caves and sneaking into the Doolin mines. \n5. The Coast\nTo end our incredible\
  \ week in Doolin, our final exploration decision pushed us to the edge of the world.\
  \ Our new friends led us past the Holy Rosary Cemetery and out toward the ocean,\
  \ where we discovered stepping stones that led right out to sea.  The water stretches\
  \ forever as the waves crash beneath you. For a second, you\u2019re walking on water.\
  \ \nThe sunset on the edge of the world? Unrivaled."
