Text: "Since early childhood I've always seen the world as an unexplored adventure\
  \ just waiting to be embarked on. From the neighbors backyard to running away on\
  \ some crazy journey, sending the whole village on a search party looking for me.\
  \ Having lived and travelled to most continents and more countries than I could've\
  \ imagined. Many crazy adventures later I realize, you don't need to travel far\
  \ to explore a new place or to find stories to tell, it's all about the way you\
  \ view the world. I find that I've got as many stories from my own backyard as I\
  \ do from living in Thailand, teaching the Buddhist monks how to pay stairway to\
  \ heaven on guitar, or getting lost somewhere in Africa, working in Korea or swimming\
  \ down the Isar river in Munich with a bunch of crazy Brazilians. \nThis morning\
  \ I played in the tidepools by imperial beach where I live, in the afternoon hiking\
  \ in the mountains by the Mexican border, by Otay lakes, picking sage and enjoying\
  \ a beautiful day.  Adventure lays around the corner. Today's world is not the same\
  \ as it has been, we are people from every corner of the planet sharing the same\
  \ places, I'd like to tell the stories of humans living together with no thought\
  \ of ethnic or religious boundaries. I'm from a small island in northern Norway\
  \ called Lofoten island, as a kid, meeting people from other places was a rare treat,\
  \ now I live in San Diego and the world is outside my front door.  I believe the\
  \ path to a world without fear is knowledge, by traveling and sharing other peoples\
  \ stories and lifes , a writer can thin out the edges of those borders that distance\
  \ us from eatchother, and plant a seed of curiosity in the readers mind."
