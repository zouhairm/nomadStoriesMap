Text: "It\u2019s been said that everything in the vastly diverse country of India\
  \ can be taken to its extreme. It\u2019s a country of immense beauty yet utter filth.\
  \ The countryside can seem barren, yet the cities and traffic are the densest on\
  \ earth. The rich have unimaginable wealth and the poor can barely scrape by. Bollywood\
  \ actresses dress seductively yet the country as a whole is extremely socially conservative\n\
  \n\n\nBecause of this social conservatism, it\u2019s important that women travelers\
  \ educate themselves to India\u2019s social mores and culture to best prepare for\
  \ a safe journey\n\nDuring a month-long trip to India, I met many women traveling,\
  \ with companions and in groups. There were those on short but expensive holidays,\
  \ backpackers and volunteers traveling for several months and, of course, those\
  \ who were working for an extended period of time through pre-arranged programs.\
  \ Most of them were respectful of the local customs but some of these women behaved\
  \ and dressed in manners that were insulting and disrespectful to Indians. I believe\
  \ this disregard was due to ignorance rather than any intentional point to defy\
  \ Indian traditions. This lack of awareness, however, not only affects how that\
  \ individual may be treated by the locals, but also how other travelers who follow\
  \ in their footsteps will be treated\n\nTo avoid any missteps or cultural faux pas,\
  \ here are some things women should be aware of as they travel around the magnificent\
  \ country of India\n\nClothing\n\nDressing appropriately will set the tone of how\
  \ you are received by the locals (and potentially other travelers) and will help\
  \ ensure that unwanted attention and advances from men are kept to a minimum. Low\
  \ cut, tight-fitting shirts, tank tops, skirts that fall above the knees, shorts\
  \ and bikinis are highly discouraged. While swimsuits can be worn in beach resort\
  \ areas such as Goa, consider wearing a conservative one-piece and covering yourself\
  \ with a sarong and t-shirt when you\u2019re not sunbathing or when you are interacting\
  \ with locals. Short sleeve cotton shirts can be worn in warmer climates but they\
  \ should be loose fitting and not revealing. Observe the locals and dress a bit\
  \ more conservatively than the most liberally dressed woman\n\nYou will be more\
  \ readily accepted and respected if you incorporate some of the local dress into\
  \ your outfits. Plan to shop once you arrive \u2013 it will help you fit in with\
  \ the locals and perhaps allow you to share in some of the beauty that every Indian\
  \ woman seems to exude."
