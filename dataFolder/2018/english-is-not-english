Text: "Where I come from, English is not English. \n\nEnglish in our sense is filled\
  \ with slangs not decipherable by the average man. It is where grammar is bettered\
  \ by facile pronunciations, phrases such as simple as \"like that\" would be twisted\
  \ to \"liddat\" and words like \"la\" existed in our dictionary to end our sentences.\n\
  \nOften what we would call \"rojak sentences\" where it is mixed with a variety\
  \ of languages, where I come from, English is not English - aunties would often\
  \ come during festive visits to say, \"Ah boy old already but still not married?\
  \ Tunggu apa? Just find a girlfriend la.\"\n\nWhere I come from, English is not\
  \ our national language. I remember standing at the parade square in primary school\
  \ watching my non-Malay speaking peers sing our national anthem in Bahasa Melayu\
  \ as though they understand the words but every day, I watch as they murmur sentences\
  \ that have no meaning to them just because the laws tell us we have to.\n\nWhere\
  \ I come from, English is not English but grammar is never misused. \"There\", \"\
  their\" and \"they're\" are correctly written in exams and essays, and words like\
  \ \"your\" and \"you're\" are not mistaken to be the other. Apostrophes are never\
  \ missed and suddenly, language is our best forte. \n\nThis is that moment where\
  \ I, a girl who had come from an average school with average writing abilities,\
  \ got picked out for a creative English writing course. I, who could not spell in\
  \ kindergarten until I learned to read and I, who needed a reading buddy as I aged\
  \ on to primary school, earned the faith of my teachers. My teacher, who had come\
  \ from India and was a terrible English teacher, sought to make sure I had the best\
  \ as she pushed me to get into the first English class in preparation for my GCSEs.\n\
  \nOver here, our English is Singlish. Our English is indecipherable to the average\
  \ man who has never stepped foot into our country before. \n\nBut this is where\
  \ it can all change because our English is still English, no matter where we come\
  \ from. Our \"tea\" is still \"tea\", and when we break something, it would be \"\
  spoiled\" rather than \"broken\". English is still English but not entirely English.\n\
  \nWords like \"rendevous\" and \"en route\" are unheard of because here, French\
  \ words are not English while our English contains words like \"gila\" or \"bo pian\"\
  \ from both Bahasa Melayu and Mandarin, respectively. \n\nAfter all, our English\
  \ is different from the world's because I come from, English is not English."
