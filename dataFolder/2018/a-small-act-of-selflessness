Text: "I feel travelling helps you get rid of preconceived notions. Travelling gives\
  \ you the chance to explore beyond your horizons and win over your fears. Travelling\
  \ helps you to encounter humanity and other beautiful sides of people. My story\
  \ isn't an imaginary one,  it's one of the incidents that I'll probably never forget.\
  \ An incident that changed my way to look and admire people. \nRecently I visited\
  \ Dehradun India, a small city wrapped in the arms of mountains with pleasant weather\
  \ and greenery; the sunsets are the most beautiful. It's so small that everything\
  \ seems to be less than 15kms away and the names are quite identical to confuse\
  \ a tourist or a traveller. There are a lot of experiences that changed me as a\
  \ person. One of them, as silly as it may sound. One fine morning I decided to go\
  \ out to explore, so I went shopping. I don't really like shopping but I love to\
  \ buy something from the place I travel to which is significant to the local culture.\
  \ I had their local delicacies. It was sunny and I decided to go back to my guest\
  \ house. I boarded a bus and I was all ears, listening to the conductor calling\
  \ the names of the bus stands. I got off at a wrong stop, scared and perplexed in\
  \ the new city around new people with no money left (except cards and PayTM) and\
  \ with no data pack too. Here was I standing in the scorching heat, asking passer-by(s)\
  \ and they themselves had no clue where my guest house was situated, but I was lucky\
  \ enough and I saw a school boy walking his way home. I asked him if he could help.\
  \ So, handed me 10rs note which was for this own use,  and said \"Didi Vikram vale\
  \ ko yeh bolna\"( tell the driver to drop you at this address).The first though\
  \ that came in my mind was may God bless him. How can a person be so selfless, though\
  \ I didn't accept it, instead I asked him to walk me half way if he could and he\
  \ did, almost till my guest house.By seeing this selfless act, which might not seem\
  \ too much, made my heart wept the tears of love.\nIn Dehradun, humanity serves\
  \ the people and the tourist. In a world where people are fighting and making chaos\
  \ out of trivial issues such as cast, creed, gender, race etc., we come across such\
  \ people giving out rays of hope to the ones in need. There are no boundaries of\
  \ religion that separates the kindness humanity and love.I believe in breaking up\
  \ all the pre-conceived notions and let my thoughts wander in all directions"
