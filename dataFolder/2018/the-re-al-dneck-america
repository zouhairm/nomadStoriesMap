Text: "Let\u2019s go to the States, they said. It\u2019s gonna be fun they said. Adventurous\
  \ and curious as I was, this sounded like the best idea ever to me. And so it began.\n\
  At the age of fiftheen, my head full of High-School-Musical-Songs, I started my\
  \ biggest adventure so far:  A High-School-Year in North Carolina at the east coast\
  \ of the United States. I just turned sixteen, annoyed by my parents (like every\
  \ sixteen-years-old girl is) and ready to start my cheerleader career in this far\
  \ away country that seemed to be so familiar.\nI have to admit that my passion for\
  \ a stay abroad started out with the wish to go to Costa Rica \u2013 beaches, palm\
  \ trees, puravida. Since I did not even know what \u201Cvamos a la playa\u201D was\
  \ supposed to mean and my Mom didn\u2019t want me to go to such a - in her opinion\
  \ - dangerous country I ended up applying for the United States. \nWell, and there\
  \ it was - The last thing I expected: Endless roads, a small house in the middle\
  \ of the woods, guns lying around on the kitchen counter, chicken and Country Music\
  \ all day long and church three times a week. Hello, redneck America and hello,\
  \ culture shock! \nEven school was totally different from what I was used to. The\
  \ bus picked me up from home and the ideal American school bus was not comfortable\
  \ at all. Lucky me that my hostsister turned sixteen just a month after I arrived\
  \ and we were able to take the car from then on. I enjoyed those morning rides with\
  \ her a lot. My hostfamily was one of the reasons that made my start in the US easier\
  \ and the whole time more valuable. They were big-hearted and hard-working people\
  \ who loved their country and wanted to make my stay amazing. They took me on trips,\
  \ introduced me to John Deer tractors and fed me biscuits, bacon and homemade ice\
  \ tea.\nI learned to love this tiny piece of a very huge country through the people\
  \ who shared a part of my journey. I never ended up cheerleading but I scored some\
  \ goals for my soccer team and cheered for my Cross Country mates. I fell in love\
  \ and out of love just as quickly as american teenager girls did, went to prom and\
  \ football games. It was the typical High-School-Year in some ways after all but\
  \ even more importantly, it was my personal High-School-Year.\nLooking back, the\
  \ last thing I expected made it so valuable for me. Is that not what traveling is\
  \ about? Leaving your comfort zone, opening up to a different lifestyle and perspectives\
  \ on life and just taking it all in \u2013 the good and the bad times."
