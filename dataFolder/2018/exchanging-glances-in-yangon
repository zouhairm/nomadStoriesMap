Text: "For three long hours the train reliably chugged along, leaving the bustling\
  \ center of Yangon for the suburbs, then returning once again to complete the loop.\
  \ Although nothing more than an aging local commuter train, Yangon\u2019s \u201C\
  circle train\u201D has become a popular tourist attraction of sorts to catch a glimpse\
  \ of everyday local life. I proudly put on my colorful purple and gold longyi, the\
  \ traditional Myanmar skirt that I had had made for me at the market the day before,\
  \ and settled in for the ride.\n\nWith just a few stops left, my body glistened\
  \ with sweat and my stomach grumbled. I began to grow weary of the sudden starts\
  \ and stops and smells until a young monk boarded the opposite end of my train car.\
  \ I observed curiously as he took out his iPhone and earbuds and sunk into the bench,\
  \ no different than any other modern day commuter. He glanced towards me several\
  \ times, and I felt the power of his kind, curious gaze. \n\nThe train screeched\
  \ to a halt back in Yangon and I jumped off, eager to appease my empty stomach.\
  \ \u201CHello,\u201D I heard from a few paces behind me as I caught a glimpse of\
  \ the saffron robe. \u201CHello!\u201D I replied. \u201CIs it okay if I practice\
  \ my English with you?\u201D he inquired. \u201COf course!\u201D I said, instantly\
  \ at ease. \n\nSom told me he had come to Yangon to go for a walk after school and\
  \ we quickly discovered that a love of aimlessly wandering across cities is just\
  \ one of the many things we had in common. He was curious about my travels, life\
  \ in California, my family and culture. I was equally curious about Buddhism, life\
  \ as a monk, and Myanmar culture. \n\nSom educated me about the many rules he has\
  \ to follow as a monk. It is forbidden to play sports, to go to the cinema, and\
  \ to eat food after noon, he recounted as I guiltily slurped noodles opposite him\
  \ at the 999 Shan Noodle House. Monks are highly revered in Myanmar, and the restaurant\
  \ opened a separate dining area just for us. Occasionally Som giggled to himself\
  \ like a schoolboy to fill a lull in the conversation in the empty, dimly lit dining\
  \ room. \n\nAs the sun set behind Yangon\u2019s Sule Pagoda, the air cooled off\
  \ and we continued our evening stroll while Som told me about his dream to go to\
  \ the US or UK and learn to speak English as well as me. Eventually I bowed my head\
  \ in gratitude and wished him the best with his future travels and language studies.\
  \ I snapped a quick selfie of us on the street corner as we bid farewell, then watched\
  \ as he glided down the street, his saffron robe fading into the sunset."
