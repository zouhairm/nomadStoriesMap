Text: "The speakers crackled. \"Good evening ladies and gentlemen. Welcome on board\
  \ flight CX321...\" I put my headphones on, drowning out the rest of the announcement.\
  \ It was past midnight and after 10 hours on the go, I just wanted to settle into\
  \ my seat\u2014my home for the next 13 hours.\n \nAround me, crew members were preparing\
  \ for the flight; passengers were chatting quietly.  A plastic bag rustled as someone\
  \ dug into their snacks. The woman across from me had already drifted off, her head\
  \ nodding back and forth. I wondered how long it would be until she came to rest\
  \ on her neighbour\u2019s shoulder.\n\nDespite being exhausted, I was wide awake\
  \ with images of my great Spanish adventure. I couldn\u2019t wait to see the Sagrada\
  \ Familia with my own eyes, sit on the steps beside Gaudi\u2019s famous lizard,\
  \ and have my own Game of Thrones experience at the Real Alcazar palace.\n \nThe\
  \ hours slowly ticked by. I shifted around in my seat trying to get comfortable.\
  \ I'd given up on sleep and was flicking through the channels on the seat-back TV\
  \ when something unusual caught my eye. \n\nBold text flashed across the screen.\
  \ \n\n\"Breaking news.\"\n\nMy eyes widened.\n\n\"Terrorism.\"\n\nMy body tensed.\n\
  \n\"Las Ramblas.\" \n\nI felt the blood drain from my face.\n\nI sat in disbelief\
  \ as scenes of armed police, panic-stricken pedestrians and lifeless bodies strewn\
  \ across a road unfolded on the news. \n\nWas this really happening? I was 12,000\
  \ metres in the air, bound for a city that had just experienced a deadly terrorist\
  \ attack. This sort of thing wasn\u2019t supposed to happen. Not in Spain. Not to\
  \ me. Different scenarios raced through my mind. Would the airport get shut down?\
  \ Would the plane be redirected to another country? Even if we could land, would\
  \ it be safe to go to my hostel?\n\nI scanned the dimly lit aircraft, expecting\
  \ to see other anxious faces. But everyone seemed oblivious to the horror that lay\
  \ ahead of us. I had no choice but to sit and wait.\n\nOnce the initial shock subsided,\
  \ I felt a different emotion boiling up inside me. Anger. How dare they destroy\
  \ the lives of innocent people! \u2018Likelihood of terror attack\u2019 should not\
  \ be an item on your travel checklist, alongside \u2018visa requirements\u2019 and\
  \ \u2018weather warnings\u2019.  \n\n\"I\u2019m not going to let these murderers\
  \ dictate my happiness or change my love of travel,\" I thought determinedly. There\
  \ was no going back now. I had to be courageous.\n\nAfter what seemed like an eternity,\
  \ the aircraft doors opened. I took a deep breath and stepped outside.\n\n\u201C\
  Welcome to Barcelona.\""
