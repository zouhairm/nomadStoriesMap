Text: "The sun shone softly through the fog. I glanced down over three tiers of tourists\
  \ and photographers on the top of the mountain. Spying a fishing boat weaving its\
  \ way upriver between the misty mountain peaks I revelled in the relative silence\
  \ and absolute beauty. The calm was broken only by sounds of camera shutters clicking\
  \ away and the hum of happy tourists\u2019 game enough to brave the pre-dawn stair\
  \ climb. So, this is country China. The beauty of Guangxi. A happy accident of circumstance\
  \ for me.\nI\u2019d decided on a last-minute trip to China. While there, my friends\
  \ had organised a trip to Yangshuo. I\u2019d never heard of it but happily jumped\
  \ on board, excited not to have to be the planner of events. After arriving, a friend\
  \ announced at dinner that he was going to be leaving at 3am to climb Xianggong\
  \ Mountain to reach the peak at dawn and invited all of us to join. As if 3am wakeups\
  \ were the norm. \nAfter hearing a few comments about sleeping in, I blurted \u2018\
  Sure I\u2019ll come\u2019, with Esther claiming that she too would help split the\
  \ cost of a trip to the bottom of the mountain. The rest of the trip, the climb\
  \ up the mountain, would most likely only cost my pride. Being unfit, I realised\
  \ it would be an uphill battle, literally.\nSo, after the climb we made the summit\
  \ before the sun peeked through the clouds and dealt its beauty in waves of muted\
  \ light. After admiring the view for a while I spotted a tall man standing with\
  \ the most serene smile on his face. He had no camera, no phone, no one with him,\
  \ just a smile. An enigma. I needed to know more.\nI had gotten used to communicating\
  \ with hand gestures and basic phrases but thankfully he spoke a little English.\
  \ Excitedly he told me, this was his first trip ever from his home in country Taiwan.\
  \ He had saved up for it over ten years and taken planes, trains, buses, taxis and\
  \ more to get there. Staring at him, awed, I realised he wasn\u2019t going to have\
  \ anything to physically show for it but the memory of the experience. I like to\
  \ think I value time, money, and effort. But until that moment I hadn\u2019t believed\
  \ myself a privileged person. Here was someone who had planned to be in this spot\
  \ for ten years when I had basically happened upon this trip, this place, this opportunity.\
  \ I wished I had something to give him to remember this spot, instead deciding right\
  \ then that I would make the most of my surroundings wherever I might be. I\u2019\
  m not sure what he is doing right now, but 3am wake ups are now the norm in my life."
