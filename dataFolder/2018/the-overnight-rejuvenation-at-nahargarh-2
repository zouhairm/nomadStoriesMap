Text: "I was invited to a mutual friend\u2019s birthday party by a friend. I hadn\u2019\
  t talked to her in a long time and didn\u2019t know most of the people who were\
  \ coming. But as I had been facing issues in my group and hadn\u2019t had an outing\
  \ in a while, I accepted to go. The plan was to go to a bar, drink and dance, and\
  \ then go to hostel and watch a horror movie. It was pretty good for me. I was waiting\
  \ for the day.\nHer birthday came and I was really excited. It would be the first\
  \ time in my college life that I would be going without my old friends. It was going\
  \ as planned. We went to a bar, drank, ate and danced. We then went to the hostel\
  \ to watch Sinister. Mid-way through the movie we realized that something was missing.\
  \ The trip needed to be made more adventurous. So we decided to go to Nahargarh\
  \ Fort to witness the glorious sunrise view.\nWe were all set to go at 4:30 in the\
  \ morning. It was an hour long drive and the cold November winds least bothered\
  \ us. We got into the car and zoomed off. Under the streetlights and the blanket\
  \ of stars, the drive was real fun. We were driving up the mountain in no time to\
  \ arrive our destination. It was still dark while we were going up the mountain.\
  \ We spotted a place from where city can be viewed. We halted there and went to\
  \ the edge. It was a terrific view. We could see the streetlights and some house\
  \ lights shining in the darkness of night under the countless shining stars. We\
  \ wanted to stop there but had to reach the top for sunrise.\nWe went up to the\
  \ fort gate and parked the car. Now we had to go up there on feet. We started climbing\
  \ up the fort. Stair or stones, it didn\u2019t matter. All we wanted was to get\
  \ up there in time. It was chilling cold, but as we all had a good amount of whiskey\
  \ in our belly, we were able to survive. We reached up to the point while still\
  \ dark. We sat there silently, waiting for the sun to come. The rays starting coming\
  \ out. Seeing them fall on the fort boundary was a view worth the wait. It was a\
  \ spectacular sight and the cool wind was very calming. I could feel my soul just\
  \ flowing with the wind.\nSitting there, I realized how much I enjoyed with these\
  \ people. I actually enjoyed more than with my friends. I never expected that I\
  \ would click with these in the first time itself. I would like to travel with these\
  \ people rather than my friends. It is interesting how you meet some people and\
  \ get along straightaway. I never missed my friends on this trip. I am glad that\
  \ that I made this decision to come along."
