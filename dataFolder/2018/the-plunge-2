Text: "Risks. Everyone tells you to take them and the world campaigns on their promises.\
  \ However, risk will not find you. It will not knock on your door and it isn\u2019\
  t patient nor does it slow down. Risk is the adrenaline junkie of the universe.\
  \ When I was 20 the world opened up a crack more with my college swim team\u2019\
  s annual trip that would now be to Puerto Rico as opposed to Florida. The trip started\
  \ off like all others: arrive from the airport \u2013 pool. Wake up call \u2013\
  \ pool. Sun and fun and then\u2026you guessed it \u2013 pool. After a grueling practice\
  \ one day \u2013 all us \u201Cadults\u201D went crazy on the diving boards/platforms.\
  \ Jumping, diving, and generally treating it as our own adult water-park. It wasn\u2019\
  t long before a couple guys moved on up the 10 meter platform \u2013 the tallest\
  \ one that the divers hadn\u2019t even been going off yet. I went up too, and there\
  \ were maybe 12 of us all standing around before a handful took the plunge off the\
  \ edge. I crept to the edge and peered down (its true what they say \u2013 just\
  \ don\u2019t look) and I had a couple friends behind me that were giving me the\
  \ customary support that are felt at the deepest levels when they say \u201Cyou\
  \ won\u2019t do it\u201D. Now I had to jump. I looked up and straight ahead to some\
  \ of the fields outside the wall of the complex and comforted myself with the thought\
  \ \u201Cwell at least it\u2019s a pretty view \u2013 in case it\u2019s your last\u201D\
  \ And took the tiniest step possible over the edge. Now 10 meters up is a lot higher\
  \ than you think and I have been skydiving since this and this was worse - same\
  \ stomach drop \u2013 no safety net. I dropped over the side and while dropping,\
  \ I started to lean back, to the point where mid-flight down I was fast approaching\
  \ a back flop. Fortunately for me, there was a split instance where I realized what\
  \ was happening and tried to self-correct somewhat by pulling myself forward against\
  \ I managed to only turn one thigh and the back of one arm a deep purple from the\
  \ smack. From this experience I took away an addiction. An addiction to the unknown\
  \ and the adrenaline that comes with unpredictability. I wouldn\u2019t have realized\
  \ how much I love the rush of going outside my bounds, and how much I love the fear\
  \ too, if it hadn\u2019t have been for that jump. The rest of that trip was spent\
  \ hiking waterfalls, horseback riding on the beach and night swimming in water that\
  \ was as warm as a bath. I went to the edge, literally, but also mentally, I pushed\
  \ myself and now I can\u2019t stop pushing myself and I wouldn\u2019t have it any\
  \ other way."
