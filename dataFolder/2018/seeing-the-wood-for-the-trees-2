  \ across the landscape rolling past the window. We were churning along a dirt track\
  \ which separated two swathes of rich growth. \n\u2018Gel-lapa saveet\u2019, my\
  \ anglicised repetition made Joel chuckle, \u2018but these aren\u2019t palm trees?\u2019\
  \ Outside was the same rainforest mix which encircled Joel's village. \n\u2018Not\
  \ yet, soon\u2026\u2019. \n\nOn cue, the landscape changed. The road improved to\
  \ well-maintained gravel. Through the window, the shifting tree canopy plateaued\
  \ into monochrome regularity. Repeated, neat rows of palm trees zipped by. It was\
  \ still green, it was still lush, but it was all the same.\n\nThe first time I saw\
  \ such a plantation, my unaccustomed eyes saw only the trees. It looked like a rainforest\
  \ for the ruthlesslessy methodical. Only after I walked through the Malaysian jungle\
  \ did these plantations begin to look like a desert. Only after I saw fires still\
  \ burning did I understand how these areas were formed. Indeed, only after I shared\
  \ a lunch in Kuala Lumpar with someone tracking the palm oil companies encouraging\
  \ these fires did I realise the impact of my oil consumption. It is hard to protect\
  \ what you don\u2019t know is missing.\n\nTo grow palm oil, large swathes of land\
  \ need to be cleared. This is most effectively achieved by burning the rainforest.\
  \ Planters can easily cross the charred land to sow oil palms. I had never heard\
  \ of \u2018haze\u2019, of \u2018PSI\u2019 or even palm oil before I became used\
  \ to staying inside when the air pollution became too high. Indonesia and Malaysia\
  \ explore 85% of all palm oil. It is easy to accuse these farmers, but Britain is\
  \ tainted by exactly the same history of clearance. I returned to the UK and stared\
  \ at hills grazed bare by sheep while the news of fires hungrily spreading across\
  \ the flammable peat soils in Sumatra to become the worst on record echoed on the\
  \ radio. I saw history only repeating itself in the Malaysian archipelago. \n\n\
  Seeing the palm plantations emphasised that I must enjoy my place within Earth\u2019\
  s systems. Like all co-operation, this hinges on giving back as much as I have been\
  \ given. This can be fun; life is much more unexpected when it is not neatly organised.\
  \ We can each take control of our own impacts. I began to devise ways to still travel\
  \ while not harming anybody, showing others it was possible too. As Joel continued\
  \ \u2018\u2026once one [plantation] comes up, then they come and come and come;\
  \ a big impact\u2019. Maybe that phrase could no longer apply to palm oil trees,\
  \ but to us."
