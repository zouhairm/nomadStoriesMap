Text: "The sublime peaks of the Southern Alps rise above us, as I sit, hands in my\
  \ lap, waiting for the service to start. The Church of the Good Shepherd stands\
  \ on a historic site on the southern edge of Lake Tekapo. The tiny stone chapel\
  \ is lost in the vista of majestic snow-capped mountains and the bright blue-green\
  \ of the lake. It is unbelievably, incomprehensibly beautiful. \n\nI am not religious,\
  \ yet there is something about the landscape that is transcendent. Redemptive, almost.\
  \ It is easy to see why this was the location chosen by early settlers at which\
  \ to worship. \n\nWe had just driven from Christchurch, an unsmiling city still\
  \ in the shadow of disaster, where we visited my friend Tom. His family home crumbled\
  \ in the 2011 earthquake and he had spent two days living in a tent. I met him outside\
  \ a bar in Queenstown a few days later, where I was travelling with a friend. He\
  \ was fragile and vulnerable; his relationship with reality hanging by a thread.\
  \ He clung onto our affirmations, made to ourselves and others, that it was OK to\
  \ be a hot mess. \n\nSeven years later, I had returned to New Zealand with my new\
  \ husband. We saw Tom at work, back in the city that formed him, helping to rebuild\
  \ the community that nature had tried to obliterate. In the Christchurch kitchen\
  \ of his restaurant, he has created his own world that he can control. A starter\
  \ of bread is followed by a dish called \u2018courgette\u2019, and then one called\
  \ \u2018carrot\u2019. The food we have is sumptuous and decadent, and nothing like\
  \ the unexciting vegetarian fare at home. \n\nThe produce is as respected as the\
  \ land it comes from. A land that gives them mountains and lakes, which form the\
  \ synonymous long white cloud, and the land that has trembled and shaken and destroyed.\
  \ \n\nWe explore Christchurch and imagine ourselves to be in post-Soviet Russia.\
  \ The mood is desperate, hopeful. Sad, exultant. Creation is happening everywhere,\
  \ and yet you have to really look to see it. \n\nOn the road the next day, we pick\
  \ up two hitch-hikers. It goes against my hard-nosed Londoner instinct, but the\
  \ scenery is too beautiful not to share and we are feeling atoned. One is a smiling\
  \ Norwegian, the other a scowling German. They have just been volunteering in Christchurch,\
  \ they tell us, aiding with the redevelopment of the city centre. \n\n\u201CAnd\
  \ where can we drop you?\u201D I ask, slightly fearful of the German\u2019s gaze.\n\
  \n\u201CThe church at Lake Tekapo\u201D, she says, and smiles sweetly."
