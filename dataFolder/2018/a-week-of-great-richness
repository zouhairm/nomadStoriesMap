Text: "I was about to start my Asian adventure but I didn't have any specific plans\
  \ and my budget was limited due to previously losing 600 Euros.\nMy first destination\
  \ was the Philippines. I found work in a hostel in Puerto Princesa for three weeks\
  \ and this is where I met Rose, a Filipina girl who also worked there. We quickly\
  \ got on very well. \nWhen the work finished, Rose kindly asked me if I wanted to\
  \ stay with her and her mum at their home before moving on to my next destination.\
  \ Rose was worried because her house wasn't nice but that never mattered to me as\
  \ her offer of hospitality was so genuine. \nWhen I got to her home she introduced\
  \ me to her mom, Rebeca, who didn't speak any English but she received me with a\
  \ beautiful smile.\nThey lived in extreme poverty. The floor of their house was\
  \ just earth, the walls were made out of bamboo and they didn't have any basic amenities,\
  \ not even a bathroom and the beds were just wooden bases. \nRose worked all day\
  \ so I spent all the time with Rebeca. As we didn't have a common language, we communicated\
  \ by signs, gestures and smiles.\nRebeca was worried about making me feel comfortable\
  \ so I showed her that she didn't have to treat me as a guest by starting to help\
  \ her with the daily chores around the home and helping with their candy business.\n\
  I had bought some food and I cooked for them every day, they were used to eating\
  \ only rice with fish so they were happy trying new things. Rebeca loved to show\
  \ the neighbors what I had cooked for them.\nI was like a celebrity in their community,\
  \ I had all the locals around all day watching what I was doing. They all seemed\
  \ happy and amazed to have me there.\nEvery evening we taught each other our native\
  \ languages and Rebeca always combed my hair and made me braids whilst we waited\
  \ for Rose to return home.\nWe quickly made a very special bond just having the\
  \ common language of love. Rebeca began to treat me as if I were her daughter and\
  \ I saw in her the maternal figure which I had not felt for nine years since my\
  \ own mother died. \nI wrote every day what I was living and I cried every night\
  \ before sleep, this special family touched my heart, they gave me everything without\
  \ having anything.\nAfter a wonderful week of pure richness I left, leaving them\
  \ by own initiative the payment I had received from the hostel where I worked and\
  \ a big piece of my heart. This wonderful family had welcomed me into their home\
  \ to help with my travelling costs but without knowing it, they gave me so much\
  \ more."
