Text: "Looking at Goree Island\u2019s House of Slaves is like looking at a surrealist\
  \ painting: its famous Door of No Return opens straight out onto the ocean, flanked\
  \ by walls of Martian-pink stucco and the broken grin of two curving staircases.\
  \ One of the nineteen communes d'arrondissement that comprise Senegal's capital\
  \ city, Dakar, Goree is a major destination for so-called 'dark tourism': travel\
  \ directed towards places of suffering and death, in this case related to the island's\
  \ history in the Atlantic slave trade. But Goree is also forging a reputation as\
  \ a hub for Senegalese art. The term \u2018street art\u2019 is technically a misnomer\
  \ for what you\u2019ll find on the island (Goree has no real streets \u2013 not\
  \ the kind that you can drive down), but its sandy alleyways are fringed with Cubist-style\
  \ paintings and sculptures.\n\nI am visiting the island with Ali, a slight Senegalese\
  \ man who wants to show me around his hometown. We tramp up to the island\u2019\
  s highest plateau, marked by a gun battery placed there during WWII. A local story\
  \ has it that they were only used once: to sink an English ship, mistaken for a\
  \ German one. This, however, is not what we are here to see.\n\nAli leads me into\
  \ a dark cavity beneath one of the largest guns, where a man is boiling a pot of\
  \ tea over an open flame. He greets Ali effusively, then turns to me with a grin;\
  \ he explains that he is opening a gallery for local artists in the rooms he has\
  \ excavated under the cannon.\n\nThe artist is a born speechmaker, and couples his\
  \ story of the project with explosive gestures. Goree is famous for the artists\
  \ that spill out onto its streets, but he wants to create a space dedicated solely\
  \ to them -- to celebrate African culture, and African creativity. So absorbing\
  \ is his story that after several minutes, I yelp: the teapot has caught fire.\n\
  \nAli soon ushers me on, but as we continue our tour the prospect of establishing\
  \ an artistic refuge under a defunct weapon stays with me. I think of how easily\
  \ the island\u2019s history is forgotten among the sugary pastel housefronts --\
  \ yet only a few streets away, a statue depicts a man with his arms aloft in weary\
  \ victory, broken chains still manacled to his wrists. \n\nTowards the end of the\
  \ Second World War, Picasso commented on the relationship between art and politics.\
  \ \"Painting\", he said, \"is not made to decorate apartments. It's an offensive\
  \ and defensive weapon against the enemy\". Perhaps the artist \u2013 whose name,\
  \ I am ashamed to say, I can't recall \u2013 was making just that."
