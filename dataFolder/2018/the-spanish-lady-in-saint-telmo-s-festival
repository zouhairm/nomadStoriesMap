Text: "Buenos Aires, Argentina\xB4s capital city has a lot of interesting places to\
  \ visit. One of them that any tourist can\xB4t leave Argentina without going to\
  \ it is the Saint Telmo\xB4s Festival, celebrated every Sunday. There are many stands\
  \ through the streets with many people selling antiques, souvenirs, and local objects\
  \ and food. It\xB4s a place for shopping, art and culture. You can see people singing\
  \ in the street, outdoor theather, people playing and dancing Tango. Inclusive,\
  \ in many streets around you can see a lot of cartoon characters. The most known\
  \ is \"Mafalda\", she si sitting on a park bench waiting that people sit beside\
  \ her and take the best shot! While I walked through Saint Telmo\xB4s streets with\
  \ a lot of hot because it was summer, I was watching all the old collector\xB4s\
  \ items sold there. Looking in a stand I met a spanish lady, her name was Letizia,\
  \ an old woman who told me that she arrived this beautiful southern american country\
  \ for a vacation 50 years ago. During the time of her vacations, she met the man\
  \ who after became her husband, an argentine who stole her heart, get married and\
  \ didn\xB4t return to her country, only for visit. Buenos Aires took her as a new\
  \ habitant and there she made a big family. She told me the story of every object\
  \ that she was selling in her stand, her eyes brighted a lot while she talked about\
  \ every one. She was wearing a tiny flowers dress, a hat, and in her wrist, a beautiful\
  \ watch. I asked her if the watch had a story, she told me that it was the first\
  \ present gived by her husband in their first marriage anniversary. Her husband\
  \ died few years ago but she always remember him with love. She told me that she\
  \ haves a daughter and a son. Her daughter is a Doctor and her son is a Plastic\
  \ Art Artist. It was a great conversation. I asked many things about Buenos Aires,\
  \ she told me that there are many places that would be a good experience to visit,\
  \ talked me about \"Caminito\", a very picturesque neighborhood that waits for the\
  \ locals and tourist every day, with colorful houses, with a variety of meat restaurants,\
  \ tango dancers, souvenirs shops, and the charisma of the argentines. The other\
  \ place she recommend me to visit is the Planetary Observer, a little far from Saint\
  \ Telmo. Buenos Aires is a very big city. She told me that if i liked Soccer I had\
  \ to visit the Boca Junior stadium,  it\xB4s a good place to visit, has an inside\
  \ museum with interesting objects. I had to continue my walk, I gave a hug to her\
  \ and she gave me the belssing."
