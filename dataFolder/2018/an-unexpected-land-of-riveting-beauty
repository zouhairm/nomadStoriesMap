Text: "Flying by outside my window is the drabbest landscape I\u2019ve ever seen,\
  \ a desolate high desert wasteland. Flat, dry and hot, it looks just like a massive\
  \ overcooked pancake stretching out to the horizon. I guess with a name like Death\
  \ Valley I should have been expecting this. Our destination is the Alabama Hills,\
  \ a small slice of public land adjacent to the microscopic dot of Lone Pine, California.\
  \ The dullness persists as we drive through town, a lingering melancholic cloud\
  \ permeating the air that seems unique to small town America. At the solitary traffic\
  \ light we turn onto a small road heading to the Alabama Hills. Mentally I\u2019\
  m preparing myself for yet another vapid expanse offering very little ocular variety.\
  \ At the whimsically named Movie Road we veer onto a gravel drive leading us north\
  \ into the Alabama Hills. At the first turn in the road I immediately realize how\
  \ erroneous my initial expectations were.\n\nI feel like I\u2019ve entered into\
  \ a portal magically transporting me onto another planet. I am swathed by majestic\
  \ snow-capped mountains on either side of me, rising up like skyscrapers in a spectacular\
  \ city of rocks. Luxuriously dense, silky clouds coat the late afternoon sky above\
  \ in an ivory cocoon. My lungs feel suddenly cleansed as I inhale the crisp air\
  \ of this heavenly place. The road continues to wind its way through a labyrinth\
  \ of rocky outcrops; numerous tents and campervans are haphazardly scattered across\
  \ the landscape, serving as temporary shelters for the adventurous souls who choose\
  \ to wander here.\n\nWe arrive at the trailhead for Mobius Arch, the photographic\
  \ showpiece of the Alabama Hills. Just as the setting sun begins to kiss the mountain\
  \ peaks we set off across the dusty terrain. After a short distance the trail dissolves\
  \ into the landscape and gives way to a large formation of rocks, at the center\
  \ of which is Mobius Arch in all its glory. Visitors swarm over the arch like bees\
  \ to honey, everyone wanting to witness the quintessential view of Mobius Arch at\
  \ sunset. Attempting to capture a perfect frame is proving to be a challenge, so\
  \ I put my camera down and simply observe my surroundings. The sheer splendor of\
  \ this place is humbling; the towering Sierra Nevada range framed perfectly through\
  \ Mobius Arch and everything awash in a dreamy purple haze. The fact that this truly\
  \ epic land can exist in the middle of a rather tedious stretch of desert is the\
  \ perfect example of how an unexpected surprise can come out of nowhere."
