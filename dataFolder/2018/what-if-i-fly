Text: "In September 2017, a friend of mine introduced me to Work Away. It was a perfect\
  \ opportunity for me to create a deeper connection to the places I wanted to visit.\
  \ For a small yearly membership fee, the website offered the opportunity to do part\
  \ time volunteer work for local hosts in exchange for accommodations and food. After\
  \ searching through several hosts on the website, I chose to spend two weeks with\
  \ the hosts at Emu Ridge on Kangaroo Island (KI).  This adventure would be my first\
  \ solo trip internationally so I was a little nervous. I was reminded of a quote\
  \ by Erin Hanson, \u201CThere is freedom waiting for you, On the breezes of the\
  \ sky, And you ask, \"What if I fall?\" Oh, but my darling, What if you fly?\u201D\
  \ I decided to take a leap of faith.\n \nKangaroo Island was beyond anything I could\
  \ have imagined. Since I was staying at Bev and Larry Turner\u2019s home and volunteering\
  \ on their farm and shop, I was able to immerse myself in the local culture. Every\
  \ morning, I had to opportunity to eat breakfast next to the Kangaroos on the farm\
  \ and feed the wallabies and baby emu\u2019s. Bev connected me with various locals\
  \ to explore the entire island in my spare time. I was also able to explore the\
  \ south end of the island by joining the local conservationist group called \u201C\
  Friends of the Park\" on one of their beach cleaning days. In exchange for lodging\
  \ and food, I picked up \u201Crubbish\u201D, trash, at Sandy Creek Beach and did\
  \ some frog surveying. Frog surveying at Grassdale Conservation Park was an adventure\
  \ in itself. We hiked around in the dark to find swamps at Grassdale and tried to\
  \ count the number of frogs present according to their species by listening to their\
  \ croaks. Bev was a player for an over 35 years old women basketball league and\
  \ since I used to play basketball in the past, I joined them for their first game\
  \ of the season as well. On my last full day, I attended the Kingscote Art Show.\
  \ It was a small festival but there were many talented artists and craftsmen in\
  \ the small town. Much like the local fairs in the states, there were various food\
  \ vendors and several competitions for baking, crafts, flowers, and art projects.\n\
  \nThis volunteer program was unique in that it gave me the opportunity to live with\
  \ the families in their home, explore local cuisines, meet real people, taking tours\
  \ with the locals, and joining in local activities. Had I not taken that leap of\
  \ faith, I wouldn\u2019t have made new friendships and these wonderful memories\
  \ of a lifetime."
