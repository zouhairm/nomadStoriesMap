Text: "When I decided to trek for over a month in Mt. Kangchenjunga in search of the\
  \ elusive Red Panda I knew to expect blistered heels, aching bones, a quickly depleting\
  \ lung capacity, and some of the most jaw dropping and breathtaking views that the\
  \ Himalayas has to offer. But no one warned me about the living nightmare that goes\
  \ by the name of \u201Cterrestrial leeches\u201D.\nI started my trek in Mt. Kangchenjunga\
  \ as na\xEFve as could be. With no realistic idea of what was in store for me in\
  \ the days to come I began trekking with an unshakeable spring in my step as I put\
  \ one foot in front of the other in my not-quite-broken-in-enough-for-this-type-of-trip\
  \ hiking boots. Fast forward a few days and the blistered feet, exhaustion, and\
  \ \u201Cjust thrilled to still be alive\u201D attitude had set it. And that\u2019\
  s when I started seeing them. \u201CThem\u201D. The leeches. At about 5000 ft. elevation\
  \ in the temperate forest of the Himalayas of Nepal I started to notice small wiggling\
  \ brown shapes that resembled a slightly overweight pine needle. Confusion gave\
  \ way to horror as I realized that these little seemingly harmless figures were\
  \ indeed sticking their mouths in the air and writhing back and forth trying to\
  \ hitch a ride on anything with a pumping vein that crossed their path. As we gained\
  \ elevation the little bloodsuckers became more and more abundant. To my dismay\
  \ we set up camp in a beautiful hillside overlooking the surrounding valleys which\
  \ appeared to be right in the thick of leech territory.  And so we stayed there,\
  \ for what felt like decades but was really just shy of a week. How ironic that\
  \ the thriving environment for a terrestrial leech also happens to be the very one\
  \ and the same ideal environment of the endangered Red Panda we were so desperately\
  \ trying to find. For six days I lived in fear of becoming a wriggling bloodsuckers\
  \ next meal. Not an evening would go by that I didn\u2019t wake up in the middle\
  \ of the night, turn on the flashlight, and be met with the sight of dozens of leech\
  \ shadows doing their inchworm dance move trying to find holes in the tent to get\
  \ in and feast on my flesh. They seemed to come in the masses at the most inopportune\
  \ times, like when trying to have a moment of privacy and use the bathroom.\nOnce\
  \ we left leech territory I could finally stop looking down and start looking up\
  \ at the vast beauty surrounding me. The Himalayas are every bit as magical as they\
  \ say they are. They make you feel incredibly humble, tiny, insignificant\u2026\
  much like a little bloodsucking leech."
