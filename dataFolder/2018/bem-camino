Text: "Bem Camino\n\nYellow arrows mark the trail, sometimes in hidden places. Auras\
  \ of excitement erupt. Our hearts hum, breaths forming a steady rhythm. Toes wiggle,\
  \ ready to begin the journey from Lisbon to Santiago de Compostela. Eighteen kilometers\
  \ in, and we trade sceneries, weaving and winding from coastline to plantation,\
  \ traversing the cobblestone streets and then to the grass where wild horses graze.\
  \ The incline of the street sometimes more strenuous, the flames of calves needing\
  \ a stretch. A final wave to the local caf\xE9 serving strong espresso, Lisboa graffitied\
  \ on the side in bright print. \nVerde, all around me, and I\u2019m taken back to\
  \ the vinho verde from the night prior, and the soothing, lyrical Fado, and my eyes\
  \ close, and I\u2019m right back there, sipping on culture in a dimly lit room.\
  \ But then I stumble, and I\u2019m brought back to the verde of the sugar cane vines,\
  \ the sunshine. \nThe hum of the foliage, like cicadas mimicking the music of grasshoppers\
  \ rubbing their wings together, welcoming our presence. Down, in a crevice and though\
  \ a ravine, my feet take me here of their own accord. We encounter Queen Anne\u2019\
  s lace and briars topped with yellow flowers. And the no see-ums, everywhere, congregating\
  \ and radiating off the swamp all around. The melody of a songbird dances overhead\
  \ while dried mud cracks, dissolving beneath my sneakers.  Bikers pass, although\
  \ there is nowhere to pass, and again we teeter above a river like the bridge across\
  \ the stream; this is nothing more than a dream. Wire fences divide nature from\
  \ society. We pass farms where cattle used to plow, all that\u2019s left of their\
  \ existence being footprints in the Earth. And resting there as well, a heap of\
  \ collected wheat. The thirst for carbonation and sugar, it makes me delirious.\
  \ The songbird mocks me overhead. And I fall. I collect myself, muddy and wet, and\
  \ take off my shoes, dipping my toes into the river edge. I feel the coolness of\
  \ their touch, my sweat of a different temperature. We come across one passerby,\
  \ a native pilgrim on our pilgrimage. \u201CBem Camino,\u201D we exchange, the soothing\
  \ sound of a foreign tongue.  Conversations die as exhaustion builds and we walk\
  \ in silence, finding peace in our quiet existence, our solitude, knowing all our\
  \ different roads led us to this same path, and until we meet our crossroads, there\
  \ is simplicity as we breathe in sync, sharing our memories. I take a sip of water\
  \ and continue down the Camino before me, embracing my inevitable stumbles as the\
  \ songbird leads the way."
