Text: "When I was 15 I wasn't a really curious girl. Actually, nothing at that time\
  \ caught my attention. I used to like routine, so, I loved to go to school, sleep\
  \ in the afternoon and go out with my friends. I always knew what was going to happen\
  \ 24 hours from now. My parents got me a short-time exchange program to spend one\
  \ month in the United States- I'd go to New York City, Chicago and Detroit with\
  \ one of my teachers and five other girls.\n\nI find it pretty funny how we grow\
  \ in a short period of time. When my mom came up with the idea to go, I got really\
  \ mad. \"Why would I want to go? I don't know anyone!\" I remember clearly that\
  \ it was the kind of thought that crossed my mind every single day. But I don't\
  \ know why, there was always a voice inside my head saying \"C'mon, give it a chance.\
  \ At least you are visiting New York, which is your dream.\" I followed my own advice\
  \ and waited untill it was the day.\n\nWe had a couple of meetings before it, to\
  \ decide where we'd go and to plan our trip. All of these moments were awkward.\
  \ Imagine a bunch of teenage girls with their mothers in a room. But, surprinsingly\
  \ when I saw the girls in the airport, it wasn't like this. We all started talking\
  \ non stopabble and when I realized, one of the girls was telling me something about\
  \ her childhood. I'd like to remind you that we'd met one hour ago. \n\nWhen I got\
  \ in New York, I had the highest expectation ever. The big apple is so present in\
  \ our lives that being here felt pretty much like being in a movie. I smile everytime\
  \ I remember the feeling I had when I stepped in Times Square and saw all of those\
  \ lights. Little did I knew, that would be the easiest part of the trip.\n\nIn the\
  \ following 30 days, it was so challenging for me! It's pretty silly now, but I\
  \ had never lived with people that weren't my family. One of my favorite parts of\
  \ that is when we spent two weeks in the house of one american. There wasn't much\
  \ space, things to do, or luxury, it was a small house in Detroit. Although, it\
  \ was AWESOME. I used to talk a lot to him, I'd like to tell things about Brazil,\
  \ ask what were his perceptions about everything. Simultaneously, sharing one tiny\
  \ bedroom, sleeping and waking up with the girls was definitely something that pushed\
  \ me to the edge. I grew up so much in a short period of time, learning about respect,\
  \ that people are diferent, that it's ok if we all didn't become best friends forever.\n\
  \nThe important thing was: we shared an adventure together and it bonds people."
