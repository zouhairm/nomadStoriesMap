Text: "Standing barefoot on the beach in a small town near The Hague, to my ankles\
  \ in water, I can hardly understand that it was this morning when I was home alone,\
  \ out of habit making breakfast for two and never planning to go outside. Then I\
  \ just put some things in my backpack and went to the airport with a rather modest\
  \ sum of money in my purse. I bought a special offer one-way ticket online on my\
  \ way. \nIt is calm. The sun is setting into the soft, cool waves of the North Sea,\
  \ it is almost quiet all around with small talks of the sunbathing locals or bored\
  \ Ferris wheel workers, hissing sound of the surf and strident screams of the seagulls.\
  \ They try to keep the distance, though it takes some seconds to surround me as\
  \ soon as I open the pack of my homemade cookies. With no other choice, I feed those\
  \ ridiculously screaming seagulls until there is nothing left.\n\u201CYou\u2019\
  re very kind,\u201D I turn around and see a man in his sixties who has already packed\
  \ his things and now is looking at me with a light smile.\n\u201CPardon me?\u201D\
  \n\u201CYou\u2019re very kind that you share your food. Usually tourists hate them\
  \ for stealing their herring.\u201D\nI have no words to answer so I just smile and\
  \ awkwardly scratch my arm. \n\u201CYou won\u2019t believe me until you see it by\
  \ yourself, but these guys,\u201D he pointed at the seagulls with the nod of his\
  \ head, \u201Care good robbers. They work in groups, one is flying right into you\
  \ and the other is stealing your piece of herring.\u201D\n\u201CYou\u2019re right,\u201D\
  \ I say finally, after a small laugh. \u201CI can\u2019t believe in organized crime\
  \ among seagulls. Nobody can.\u201D\nNow it is his turn to laugh. \u201CI can get\
  \ you a sandwich if you like so that you can see them work, but it\u2019s not what\
  \ I wish you. I have a little stall right over there. You deserve to try the best\
  \ herring in town as you spent your cookies on these cute flying monsters.\u201D\
  \nI thank the man and go upstairs behind him with my sneakers in my hand.\n\u201C\
  So, what brought you to the Netherlands?\u201D he asks, making me a sandwich. I\
  \ see his eyebrows go up as I tell him my line of random decisions. \nWe talk about\
  \ the tourists, the stall and the seagulls. I finally feel right.\nIt is getting\
  \ colder, there is no time for me to stay here anymore, but before I leave, the\
  \ man tells me a shorter way to get back to Amsterdam.\nI say \u201Cthanks\u201D\
  \ once more and go with a tiny smile on my face, then stop to correct my backpack\
  \ and can\u2019t help myself from giving the last glance to the sea, the darkened\
  \ Ferris wheel and the seagulls that can hardly be seen."
