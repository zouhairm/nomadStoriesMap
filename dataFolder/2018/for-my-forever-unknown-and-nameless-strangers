Text: "I wave goodbye to my bliss that will stay behind with the dilapidated temple\
  \ and begin to drag my infuriatingly unless bike down this dirt road. There is nothing\
  \ to even look at right now. Save for the few houses that rise and fall as I walk\
  \ forward, I'm surrounded by empty, rust-colored terrain.\n\nMy romanticized expectations\
  \ of cycling through Cambodia\u2019s ancient landscape did not plan for this. I\
  \ had taken off with the rising sun to explore the remaining temples on my list,\
  \ but my tour ended after just the first stop. I returned from climbing through\
  \ a temple enveloped by trees to an unexplainably deflated front tire. The solitude\
  \ I was just bragging about began to taunt me instead. I only had one option: I\
  \ would have to start walking the five miles back if I was to still catch my bus\
  \ home later today.\n\nMovement from my peripheral left soon interrupts my self-pitied\
  \ thoughts. I turn to see a tan shirtless man waving frantically from his seat at\
  \ an open-aired dining table that he shares with his presumed family. The spicy\
  \ aroma of their breakfast bowls twist my empty stomach in envy. I know how to only\
  \ say \u201Cthank you\u201D in Khmer and it becomes apparent that they know not\
  \ a word of English. Yet, I understand from the man's gestures to my tire what he\
  \ is trying to say.\n\nWe trade: he offers me a seat and I offer him my bike. He\
  \ goes up to his house behind us and disappears. The motherly figure of the table\
  \ fills a bowl with noodles and fish and hands this to me. I wish I know how to\
  \ explain how helpless I was just feeling, but I\u2019m stuck saying the only word\
  \ I know: \u201Cakun.\u201D We eat together as strangers, staring curiously at each\
  \ other from above our bowls and letting our eyes communicate what we can\u2019\
  t say.\n\nMy bowl is empty and my bike is fixed; the man has just wheeled it up\
  \ to me with a victorious smile. The entire table laughs from my repetitive akun\u2019\
  s, but this stops when I open my wallet. I look back up and see heads shaking definitively\
  \ no. I am at a complete loss of words again, but it has nothing to do from my lack\
  \ of translation skills.\n\nThe man alone follows me back to the road. I know the\
  \ temples I will now be able to see won\u2019t compare to how this family has made\
  \ me feel. I get back on my bike and reach for the nameless man\u2019s hands, promising\
  \ him in words he can\u2019t understand that they all will forever be a part of\
  \ my story. He stares confused at the few tears cascading down my face as I try\
  \ to make him understand in the single word we share. \n\n\"Akun.\""
