Text: "I still remember the day I told Ma I was gay, it was on a Sunday afternoon\
  \ and she had just returned home from church. I watched how she clasped her bible\
  \ close to her chest, how her fingers curled into fist like shapes and she slowly\
  \ uttered the word \u201Cwhy\u201D\u2026 'Why what Ma' I asked. \"Why gay!?\" she\
  \ snapped angrily.\u201CYou can be anything Kopano, except gay! I did not give birth\
  \ to a boy only to raise a girl!\u201D she said. At this point I could feel the\
  \ beads of sweat dripping down my neck. Why had I even decided to tell Ma? People\
  \ like her are old school they talk about homosexuality like a pandemic disease.\
  \ They think people like me are ill and if they do not pray for us to get well we\
  \ will die-which is true we will die, but not because we are sick, but because we\
  \ make them \u201Csick\u201D. \nLater that evening Ma gathered the women from church\
  \ and asked them to hold a special prayer service for me, this was her attempt at\
  \ fixing me, at trying to create a man from a confused boy with an absent father.\
  \                                                                              \
  \                                                                              \
  \  \nI woke up the next morning to the smell of hot porridge being prepared for\
  \ breakfast. Ma looked up from the kitchen and smiled nervously \u201Chow are you\
  \ feeling?\u201D she asked. What she really meant was; had the gay been prayed away?\
  \ I wanted to say I was still gay\u2026 still a faulty double x chromosome that\
  \ has no seat at the dinner table because my sexuality makes people lose their appetite.\
  \ Instead I nodded silently and said \u201CI\u2019m okay Ma\u201D.\n\nI left home\
  \ because my sexuality in people\u2019s mouths was starting to feel like minor tremors\
  \ before an earthquake, and I was tired of waiting for the ground to open up so\
  \ I too would turn into another statistic. \nPerhaps the reason why I have come\
  \ to love men so intensely is because I have daddy issues; I have been looking for\
  \ my father, a complete stranger in the men I call lovers. And right now I am in\
  \ a bus, heading to Lord knows where, with nothing besides the homosexuality that\
  \ the closet in my mother\u2019s house refused to welcome.            \nThere is\
  \ a slight jolt and then a halt \u201CPemba\u201D reads the board ahead\u2026 as\
  \ the light breeze from the ocean caresses my skin this is where I will start over.\
  \ I decide. This will be my new home.\n\nI just hope my mother will be okay."
