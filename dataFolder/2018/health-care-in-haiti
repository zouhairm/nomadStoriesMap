Text: "Christy was getting sick \u2013 she had drunk clairin, a Haitian moonshine,\
  \ and her stomach didn\u2019t agree with it. In a couple hours, she emptied her\
  \ system of all liquids, and was becoming delirious. It was the day before Easter;\
  \ it was dusk; and the nearest hospital was in Port Au Prince, a four hour drive\
  \ away. We didn\u2019t think she could handle the ride if we could find a car, and\
  \ on Easter Eve, that was a big if. \n\nWe were in Pailant, a small village in western\
  \ Haiti visiting our friend Steffani who was a Peace Corps volunteer in the village.\
  \ In the poorest country in the western hemisphere, there was virtually no government\
  \ in Pailant: no medical clinics, no police or firemen, no official city council,\
  \ and no government services of any kind. The village elder unofficially adjudicated\
  \ most local affairs. So when Christy grew gravely ill, Steffani called on Michael,\
  \ Pailant\u2019s village elder. He arrived quickly, listened to Christy\u2019s symptoms,\
  \ and said, \u201Cdon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ve seen this many times before. I\u2019\
  m going to call the voudou leaf doctor for you!\u201D\n\nWe all looked at each other\
  \ with raised eyebrows. Voudou? On our friend? The practice in which you stuck needles\
  \ into dolls? Steffani, however, told us not to worry. \u201CThe worst that will\
  \ happen is that nothing happens\u201D, she said. A few minutes later, Michael arrived\
  \ with an elderly lady who instructed the other women around to start a fire and\
  \ heat some water. Meanwhile, she weaved a necklace of palm leaves and placed it\
  \ around Christy\u2019s neck along with a string necklace with a key hanging from\
  \ it. Then she spent 5 minutes chanting prayers in creyol. Finally, she prepared\
  \ a cup of tea, told her to drink it, and left.\n\nWe Americans were skeptical at\
  \ the effectiveness of voudou treatment and as Christy finished her drink, she promptly\
  \ vomited it up followed by 15 minutes of dry heaves. But an hour later, she felt\
  \ much better, and was walking around as if nothing had happened. And that was awesome!\
  \ Because now it was time to head to the Voudou Festival, Haiti\u2019s way of celebrating\
  \ Easter. We danced the night away to the beat of Racines music. There, we ran into\
  \ Michael and the leaf doctor who weren\u2019t at all surprised to see Christy dancing\
  \ with the rest of us."
