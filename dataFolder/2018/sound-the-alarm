Text: "I jumped off the bus at the call for Khao San Road. The popular backpacker\
  \ hub was a beacon of familiarity and promised an opportunity to find wifi so that\
  \ I could finally explain to dear Rada why i was over 5 hours late for dinner.\n\
  \nThe day began as I departed the Cambodian coast en route to Bangkok. My plan was\
  \ to meet Rada for dinner around 6. Judging by how fast the young Khmer men behind\
  \ the wheel were flying through the countryside, weaving in and out of traffic,\
  \ I assumed we\u2019d arrive early.\n\nHowever several unexplained and extended\
  \ detours melted hopes of early arrival into nightfall. Without cellular data I\
  \ couldn't contact Rada to tell her I\u2019d be late. Wanting to be courteous grew\
  \ into a daunting anxiety that my friend may be very worried about me.\n\nKhao San\
  \ was buzzing with life at midnight. I ordered my favorite red curry and got connected\
  \ to Rada. She gave me her address. I negotiated with several taxi drivers over\
  \ a fair price for a 45 minute cab ride. Finally I found a reasonable rate and took\
  \ off into the night.\n\nIt seemed so easy. I thanked my driver and confidently\
  \ went to what I thought was her building, up the elevator to her floor, and then\
  \ searched for the room number, but the number didn't exist. I paced down the hall.\
  \ It was 2 am.\n\nI was in the entirely wrong place. As I left I saw a symbol of\
  \ a person walking down a flight of stairs, so I followed. At the ground floor I\
  \ was stopped by a sign warning that opening the door would sound an alarm. I let\
  \ out a huge sigh. I had gotten myself trapped in a fire escape and the only way\
  \ out would sound an alarm in an apartment complex of hundreds of sleeping families.\n\
  \nI panicked, I laughed, I thought about jumping out a window but it was too small.\
  \ I thought about sleeping there but the idea of leaving Rada waiting made me sad.\
  \ I had come too far to not find her house. I opened the door. A piercing, echoing\
  \ siren rang through the hallways. Several security guards ran in my direction.\
  \ I acted like I didn't do it, but I was fooling no one. I walked away casually.\n\
  \nI flagged another taxi and explained my destination. Though earnestly trying to\
  \ communicate, the language barrier was too challenging. Suddenly a Thai man emerged\
  \ from the shadows speaking perfect English. He began to translate for us, and phoned\
  \ Rada so she could talk to the driver. Within 15 minutes I arrived at her door.\
  \ She greeted me in the lobby in her bathrobe and in her adorable accent said \u201C\
  It's ok, you're here now!\u201D I was so relieved."
