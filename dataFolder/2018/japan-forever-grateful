Text: "It is summer, 2012. It seems that all the stars get aligned for this subtle\
  \ moment, and I can finally be able to accomplish on of my most dreamed experiences:\
  \ to travel to Japan.\n\nI am a bit nervous, as I have never travelled a country\
  \ on my own. But imagine this a brilliant way of spending a few days alone observing,\
  \ meditating, writing, sketching\u2026immerse in my own inspirational process, and\
  \ create a selection of art pieces that I never did, but got it tattooed instead.\n\
  I buy an airplane ticket and let know my boss that, \u2018I am traveling 16 days\
  \ to Japan\u2019. Yes, I don\u2019t ask, I just tell him, as my urge is quite intense\
  \ at this point. \n\nI plan as far as getting a JRP for 14 days, and a hostel for\
  \ a couple of nights. I already use Airbnb and I open a \u2018CouchSurfing\u2019\
  \ account. This way I will be able to meet locals, along with saving money, my total\
  \ win-win plan.\nI've got tips for places to visit, and people to meet. Those came\
  \ in the most unexpected and random ways!\n\nLongest fly ever. I get to Haneda,\
  \ exhausted. I can\u2019t find my way to the hostel. No street names. I can\u2019\
  t make any calls. Deserted streets at Takadanobaba\u2026Dazed and confused, after\
  \ what seems like an infinite moment, I find a friendly pedestrian who walks with\
  \ me to the hostel\u2019s door. I sleep 5h. I wake up at 5pm. Pitch-black. The song\
  \ of the cicada surrounds me fiercely, Japan's natural tune. \nI go to a kiosk next\
  \ door and order a local beer. Deserted streets, still. The waiter asks me if I\
  \ am Canadian, which is a question I would hear many times during this journey.\
  \ \n\nLike this, my adventure in Japan begins.\n\nFrom this moment, everything connects\
  \ and instead of being alone, I meet locals daily! \nThey are the most lovely welcoming\
  \ people I have ever meet. Either planned visits, strangers on the street (that\
  \ walked with me while chatting and sharing their lives), hostel clients, Japanese\
  \ travelers, CouchSurfing hosts... I still keep a few close friendships (YLC), and\
  \ my new Japanese moms. Who gave me love, trust and facilitated me incredible experiences\
  \ I never thought I would experience, like enjoying an Aikido class with a Mexican\
  \ teacher, student from Steven Seagal\u2019s master. Or surprise me with a very\
  \ special and secretive\u2019s Tea Ceremony class in Kyoto, after dressing me up\
  \ in full traditional clothing, behind a screen, and continuing by inviting to have\
  \ dinner at the private\u2019s house and bar of an octogenarian Geisha who kept\
  \ repeating me \u2018how lucky you are, that you met me\u2019... And I feel so."
