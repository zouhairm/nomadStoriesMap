Text: "\u2018Stop!\u2019 she screamed. I stopped, bending over and struggling to breathe,\
  \ my laugh was choked in between the little gasps of air I made. I waited for her\
  \ as my chuckle caught up with me faster. She arrived, and, with murmured excuses\
  \ of defeat, we dragged our feet through the red soil of south India. \n\nSplash!\
  \ Something heavy rocked the boat and it instantly became lighter. I looked behind\
  \ and didn\u2019t see anyone. \n\nThe mud became clayey and the grass became thick.\
  \ We were near the stream of water that had caused our lovely, wrinkled, ripe jack-fruit\
  \ smelling grandma to nag us about. The construction of the bridge had created a\
  \ small creek from the river miles out. \n\nWhere was my brother? He was literally\
  \ right behind me. Suddenly, a wet body stands up. My panic soon turns into annoyance\
  \ when I see his grinned face asking me to come join him, and then when he violently\
  \ started to shake my boat.  \n\nWe reached the creek with our homemade fishing\
  \ hooks and bags packed with smelly pickled and rice. The fishermen sitting in the\
  \ shade looked our way and wondered what four kids in pants would want on a sunny\
  \ afternoon. The bits of white rice stuck to their mouth suggested they were consuming\
  \ lunch, and we were entertainment. \n\nThe world turns upside down, slowly, and\
  \ I find my face hit the water. My face first. His arm found my shoulder and pushed\
  \ me up against the salty creek\u2019s insistence. Fuming, I start punching my brother\
  \ and then notice the laughter. Squinted eyes and yellow teeth, these men sitting\
  \ on logs, did have more to their otherwise expressionless faces. \n\nTheir dark-skinned\
  \ bodies were wrapped with white and coloured cloths around their waist. With the\
  \ few words of boat and fish in the local tongue, we were out there pushing borrowed\
  \ boats into the creek. They offered to help us, but since we thought we could ace\
  \ a simple row and swish, we declined politely. \n\nThey pulled us up to where they\
  \ were. My other companions joined in. Drying ourselves in the peaceful heat, they\
  \ shared their fried fish lunch and later showed us their nets. We nodded our heads\
  \ in agreement to everything they said even though we hardly understood. Their warmth\
  \ welcomed us to a friendship we\u2019ve never experienced before."
