Text: "Our headscarves wrapped across our faces would\u2019ve been ample protection\
  \ from Saharan winds. They prove no match, however, for the burning cloud of sugary\
  \ dust Khadjia and I produce as we grind rock sugar to powder with a mortar and\
  \ pestle, coughing violently and doubling over with laughter. A ridiculous task,\
  \ yes; but it\u2019s Thanksgiving and I must make a pumpkin pie. \n\nI offered to\
  \ cook for my Berber host family on my favorite American holiday as a parting gesture\
  \ after a month-long stay at their bed and breakfast in Aoufous, a small village\
  \ carved into the side of the canyon overlooking a date palm oasis in eastern Morocco\u2019\
  s Ziz Valley. But preparing a good old-fashioned Moroccan Thanksgiving is not without\
  \ challenges. \n\nFirst, the very word proves difficult for my Arabic-speaking hosts\
  \ to pronounce, so we adopt their best attempt: \u201CTahk-SNAH-ky\u201D. Some ingredients\
  \ must be subbed: sour pomegranates in lieu of cranberries, khobz for cornbread\
  \ in the stuffing. Earlier today, Khadija\u2019s son, Sa\xEFd, helped me navigate\
  \ the maze-like souks, deftly charming allspice from the spice vendor\u2019s baskets\
  \ and assuring me that green Kabocha squash will pass for pumpkin. We also picked\
  \ up the holiday bird: a live hen, which the butcher slaughtered for us on the spot.\
  \ I forgot, however, that only solid blocks of sugar, which melt so easily into\
  \ steaming pots of mint tea, were on hand in the kitchen. \nSo, we grind. As we\
  \ labor and laugh, I\u2019m moved by Khadjia\u2019s dedication. She doesn\u2019\
  t know about the Pilgrims, or care about pumpkin pie; she just knows it\u2019s important\
  \ to me and wants to help. \n\nWhen we finally sit down to feast, I can\u2019t help\
  \ but reflect on the significance of the holiday and my time in Morocco. Living\
  \ in a predominantly Muslim country during the 2016 US presidential election had\
  \ been sobering. Even here, election coverage was ubiquitous, and my hosts shared\
  \ in my excited anticipation of a female leader, then comforted me as I wept on\
  \ November 9th. The Ilahiane family\u2019s embrace of me, and Tahksnahky, stings\
  \ with irony (which the soon-to-follow travel ban would only heighten: in my country,\
  \ millions who look like my hosts would be barred from entry, while in Aoufous,\
  \ I arrived a stranger and was received like one of the family).    \n\nBut the\
  \ table is full of food, and Khadija is eyeing the curious Western sweet we toiled\
  \ over. I smile as I cut the first slice, filled with gratitude that after such\
  \ a labor of love we can sit down together and share a piece of the pie."
