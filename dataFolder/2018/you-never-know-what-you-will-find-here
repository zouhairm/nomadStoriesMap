Text: "India is blessed with a varied geography. While cities like Goa have beautiful\
  \ beaches and cities like leh have beautiful mountains and clear water lakes, the\
  \ western region of India is famous for its businessmen and deserts. The state which\
  \ boasts of the most famous, most beautiful deserts, is Rajasthan.\nThis is a story\
  \ of one such travel trip to Rajasthan. I was traveling with a few friends of mine\
  \ to Ranakpur which is a small quiet town in Rajasthan. Ranakpur is famous for its\
  \ temple architecture, for the beautiful hand weaved carpets, its extreme weathers\
  \ (winters with temperatures going down to 0 degrees and summers as hot as 45 degrees),\
  \ and leopards.\nWe were traveling in the weekend of 31st and was a quick three-day\
  \ trip. I wasn\u2019t too keen on exploring the town as this was my second trip\
  \ to the place. So, we chose a hotel 10 km away from the city where we can relax.The\
  \ hotel was located very near to a valley and a small river flowing by. On new year\u2019\
  s eve, the hotel had bonfires and an open dinner arranged for the guests. When we\
  \ were trying to keep ourselves warm, we saw two pairs of eyes shine in the valley\
  \ below. Being wildlife enthusiasts, we switched on torches and hushed the dinner\
  \ noise. The eyes shone again. This time we ensured we had the torches on at the\
  \ right time to see a pair of hyenas walk towards the river to drink water and then\
  \ quickly walk back making its typical laughing sound.\nWhile this was unexpected\
  \ the cherry on the cake was what we spotted the next day. We were leaving for home\
  \ and stopped at a restaurant for dinner. The restaurant looked very welcoming,\
  \ all traditional d\xE9cor suited to the local culture. Right adjacent to it was\
  \ the carpet weavers workshop. The entry to the restaurant was a little higher with\
  \ close to 15 steps going down and opening to a huge open area for dinner. As soon\
  \ as we step down, we are greeted by this stunning site of a small river, running\
  \ through. Now you may wonder what makes the river running through so special. Well,\
  \ the river had crystal clear water, blue in color (transparent clear water as in\
  \ the Maldives) surrounded by white rocks. Is this special and unexpected? Yes!\
  \ For a state known for deserts, forts and ancient history, to discover a river\
  \ with water this clear and surrounded by stones is something unexpected. A similar\
  \ view, if found in North India, it would have been very common but for such a beautiful\
  \ view to show up right in front of your eyes in arid Rajasthan is unexpected!"
