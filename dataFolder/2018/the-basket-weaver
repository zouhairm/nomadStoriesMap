Text: "\"I never know what the basket will look like when I set out.  It just comes\
  \ to me as I go.\"  The old woman says.  \n\nHer hands, gnarled from arthritis,\
  \ crinkled with age, hold a half formed basket in her lap.  A woven disk of butter\
  \ colored sweet grass alternating with coils of dark brown.  Loose strands of grass\
  \ splay out from the side.  \n\nShe lounges on a plastic lawn chair, in a flowered\
  \ dress, surrounded by a mountain of baskets.  Each basket a unique design.  This\
  \ is the Gullah Celebration Festival.  I came here because I didn't know anything\
  \ about the Gullah people, even though I live four hours from here.  Tent stalls\
  \ sell basket ball sized clumps of Shea butter from Ghana, painted necklaces, sweet\
  \ potato pie.  And here, this Gullah woman sells baskets.  She is one hundred years\
  \ old, but looks seventy.\n\n\u201CWe harvest the grass in March.  Then we dry it\
  \ and use it all year long for baskets.\u201D  She continues, her voice warm, crackled.\
  \  Her head nods toward the marsh.  \n\nSprawling, flat green marshland surrounds\
  \ us underneath a balmy February sky.  This is South Carolina Lowcountry.  Home\
  \ to the Gullah-Geechee people, who were brought to this country as West African\
  \ slaves to work on rice and cotton plantations.  Plantations that have been replaced\
  \ by luxury resorts, golf courses, and strip malls of Hilton Head Island.  Mass\
  \ tourism threatens to close in on these wetlands.    \n\nHer hands pull tight.\
  \  Her basket is a mosaic of white, yellow and brown coils.  \n\n\u201CHere, put\
  \ this strand underneath and then pull.\u201D  She hands me her basket.  I tuck\
  \ stray blonde hair behind my ear.  My hands, smooth from easy work in my short\
  \ life, rub the steady strands between my fingers.  Clumsy, inexperienced, wanting\
  \ to do it right.  She chuckles.  \n\n\u201CYou have to pull the coils tight or\
  \ else they'll unravel over time.  You want them to hold up and last.\u201D  She\
  \ says.  She weaves a blonde strand of grass underneath a brown one.  Her strong\
  \ knuckles jerk outward as she pulls the coil tight.   \n\n\"We'll see how much\
  \ longer I'll be at this.  That's why my great-granddaughter's takin' up the coils\
  \ next.\"  Her mouth spreads into a wide grin.  I smile back.  Her eyes light, ageless,\
  \ behind thick glasses.  \n\nEyes that have seen this area before there was a town,\
  \ before tourism engulfed this corner of South Carolina, before the Civil Rights\
  \ movement.\n\nWould the coils of this country be woven tighter, more integrated,\
  \ stronger when I become her age?  This Gullah woman made me hope."
