Text: "The last thing I expected was being writing this story from M\xE9xico, I arrived\
  \ here 1 month ago but seems like it was longer, that feeling you have from time\
  \ to time. Can only say thanks to the amazing person that inspired me to change,\
  \ adapt and mostly learn something new everyday, of course she is the whole reason\
  \ to this situation, we meeted on the weekly concert day in my previous job as a\
  \ waiter in my home town Porto, i was living a cycle of booze, cigarettes and 8\
  \ hours work while for fun and honing my English skills I would show my city as\
  \ a tour guide, i always said, show Porto with a beer, let's be real, it's really\
  \ cheap country for wine and beer, you would understand. In the middle of this a\
  \ girl that seemed that comed from Mars, nothing alike I ever seen, she was doing\
  \ the Santiago de Compostela walk. A pilgrim passing on my city wanting to know\
  \ more about the roman empire and Portugal, without using any money, only offering\
  \ work to get food or place to stay, inspiring in fact, I had to know more, she\
  \ said to me, only 2 days but Christmas was near and  with the help of my cousins,\
  \ the persons I lived with,they convinced 3 more days. Just for me to discover,\
  \ I didn't want this to be again the clich\xE9 I stay, someone leaves. I wasn't\
  \ sure at first, I felt an overwhelming fear to move forward, we kissed but she\
  \ moved on into the pilgrimage. I couldn't stop thinking on her, I had to meet again,\
  \ 1 week passed and a last text said, 'I'm in Braga' a more Roman city, I ran to\
  \ the train got it on the last minute before parting. I expected nothing, but spended\
  \ my 2 days off there in the city falling more in love. Went back to Porto, she\
  \ asked me, if I wanted I could do from Santiago to Finisterre with her on foot,\
  \ I said sure, I want to do it, unexpectedly I encountered challenges and barriers\
  \ I thought I would never have to face, I always thought I wouldn't sleep in some\
  \ place that I didn't even booked or had someone at the entrance, I passed one night\
  \ in one small hostel I found in the middle of a winter storm, that had one of those\
  \ doors that open bottom and up separately and we occasionally tried to open and\
  \ indeed was, can't describe the happiness of that door opening after more that\
  \ 30km walked and 11 hours nighttime\n already. We arrived to Finisterre, considered\
  \ the end of the world. I hitchhiked back to Porto and also first time  experience\
  \ on it. Took 2 days to arrive, on the same day I fired myself, gaved 2 weeks to\
  \ the company, and here i I'm."
