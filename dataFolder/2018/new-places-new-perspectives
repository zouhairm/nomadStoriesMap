Text: "The reality never truly kicked in until my friend and I were sitting in the\
  \ airport, waiting at our gate for the flight through Aeromexico, and the announcements\
  \ came on \u201CBienvenidos al vuelo numbero 766 a la Ciudad de Mexico\u2026.\u201D\
  \ excitement filled my body, my heart began to beat rapidly, our adventure was just\
  \ beginning, and every moment from then on would be something unpredictable. I bounced\
  \ in my seat as I tried to decipher the different Spanish phrases of those around\
  \ me, with the thought that I would be travelling for the next 4 months with only\
  \ the next 15 days planned. Who knew what this summer would hold.\n\nWe arrived\
  \ to our destination Huatulco, Oaxaca, Mexico. We walked out onto the landing strip,\
  \ the hot black pavement soaked with the heat of the Mexican sun. We headed towards\
  \ the palm frond rooved terminals to collect our bags. I could feel the difference\
  \ in the landscape. We ran out of the airport the moment we grabbed our bags, crossing\
  \ the highway to meet a taxi driver, who began manually cranking down the handle,\
  \ \u201CA donde vas?\u201D he asked us. After a little bit of bargaining and broken\
  \ spanish, we ventured off to our destination, winding along bumpy hills with thick\
  \ jungle brush on both sides, passing by homes of the locals who were cooking their\
  \ dinner in the shade, passing by little shops with hand-painted signs, I sat in\
  \ the back seat taking in all the new surroundings. We told the driver we wanted\
  \ to stay at the cheapest hostel. Down the narrow, cobblestone path we went, into\
  \ to the heart of the village. We passed by wooden huts with beaded curtains, hammocks,\
  \ and assortments of foods, everything was original. \n\nWe rented a caba\xF1a for\
  \ the night, which was a little hut with two hanging beds, mosquito nets, and a\
  \ room with a shower head. The warm ocean breeze wafting the heat of the tropical\
  \ weather right into our bedroom. We could hear the rhythms of the twelve foot waves\
  \ crashing onto the sandy shores.  They welcomed us out that night, we ran across\
  \ the sandy beach, doing cartwheels, and chatting with the other travelers who happened\
  \ to be in the area. \n\nWe were then greeted by a local tour guide. He told us\
  \ if we helped him promote his company, we could come on his tours for free. We\
  \ discovered the beauty hidden within village, from the magic of the natural surroundings\
  \ to the harmony of the local culture. We learned that connecting with someone who\
  \ is native to a place is the best way to see a place for what it truly is."
