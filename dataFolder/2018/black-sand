Text: "I wasn\u2019t on the edge all that long before I pushed myself over and torpedoed\
  \ down the side of an active volcano. At nearly 70 km/h, there was nothing between\
  \ me and the black sand but a piece of plywood with Teflon on the bottom. For a\
  \ few fleeting seconds I gazed out at the beautiful, blurred landscape of the forests\
  \ surrounding Leon, Nicaragua. A small bump reminded me I should be more focused\
  \ on not rolling my sand toboggan into what would surely be serious injury, if at\
  \ the very least complete humiliation.\nThe day started with a light breakfast,\
  \ trying to ease the kaleidoscope of butterflies in my stomach. Our guide gathered\
  \ the twenty or so insane asylum applicants willing to take part in this harrowing\
  \ activity and ushered us aboard one of two ominous, orange monster trucks. The\
  \ hour northeast to Cerro Negro was occupied by wind, landscape and one thought:\
  \ that I was about to summit a volcano that last erupted less than 20 years ago\
  \ and one that has decided to spew its contents into the atmosphere 23 times in\
  \ the last 150 years, making it one of the most active volcanoes in the world. And\
  \ then slide down it.\nIt was only in the final moments of approaching the site\
  \ that the trees thinned and we could all catch a glimpse of the massive mound of\
  \ black sand we had thought it a wise choice to surf down. 700 meters? It didn\u2019\
  t look THAT big. Forty-one degrees? It didn't look THAT steep.\nIn comparison to\
  \ the nearly 45 minutes hike up the backside of the piping hot sand dune, the brief\
  \ 120 seconds it took me to descend felt like a blink. To think I was one of the\
  \ slower ones too, with the current record holder breaking 100 km/h. When I reached\
  \ the base, the cheers of my fellow thrill seekers and a relieved looking guide\
  \ greeted me. The guide approached to give me a pat on the back, a beer and a chocolate\
  \ chip cookie; three important things to soothe a heart that was still racing. It\
  \ was the best beer I have ever tasted.\nOnce we all came down and calmed down,\
  \ we boarded the trucks and drove toward the setting sun, returning to our hostel\
  \ where mojitos awaited us. For the rest of the night, I sipped rum, reconsidering\
  \ the pride I held as someone who thinks himself a great decision maker, my fingernails\
  \ still black from the sand."
