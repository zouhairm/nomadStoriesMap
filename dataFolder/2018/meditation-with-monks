Text: "After many months in Japan, I finally felt empowered to have an experience\
  \ I knew very little about. I rode my bike the mile and a half, having to dismount\
  \ during the last part of the ride as the temple is located up in the foothills\
  \ of the Japanese Alps.  I began walking around the grounds, aimless, trying to\
  \ procure any information. Having any type of experience while living in a foreign\
  \ country requires a larger array of detective skills than living in a familiar\
  \ place. \nAfter figuring out where to go, I entered the traditional Japanese tatami\
  \ room and took a seat on the floor for the first part of the program, the instruction.\
  \ Unbeknownst to me earlier, I received a brochure in English that clearly outlined\
  \ the postures and manners that are part of a proper Zen meditation session. \n\
  I joined the session with a dozen other first timers. Here I was a foreigner in\
  \ a country, but I was in a room of fellow newbies. I certainly wasn\u2019t alone\
  \ in my confusion. \nAfter nearly an hour of precise choreographed instructions\
  \ we were finally ready to proceed with our meditation. We were led in a single\
  \ file line to cushions on the outside perimeter of the mediation room and each\
  \ took our places against a paper screen. When we finally settled into the meditation,\
  \ I was alone with my thoughts. \nIt was chilly and a bit damp due to the spring\
  \ air, but not enough to be completely uncomfortable. It was a grey day so not much\
  \ light shone. There was a soft and muted ambience in the air and in a way it was\
  \ almost spooky, but at the same time cozy. I thought to myself I\u2019m at a Buddhist\
  \ temple, in Japan and it\u2019s just funny, I sort of snickered to myself. In moments\
  \ like these, I like to picture the entire planet from above and see myself as a\
  \ tiny speck enclosed in a part of it, so far away from my familiar surroundings.\
  \ \nThis feeling brings empowerment that I can connect on a local level almost anywhere\
  \ I go. I was on my own, but I wasn\u2019t alone. I was free to do something that\
  \ might seem so foreign to others, but to me was just a day in the life in Japan."
