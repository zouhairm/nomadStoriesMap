Text: "\u201CYour understanding depends on which lens are you seeing through at the\
  \ time\u201D. I instantly remember the words of my former professor as I took my\
  \ time to let the sunset-orange sunrays kindly cherish my skin. It was warm. The\
  \ kind of warmth that opens a reticent yet comforting smile on one\u2019s face.\n\
  \nMy bus continued through the unpaved street back to the city and for the first\
  \ time I felt like I was really saying goodbye. A farewell to the picturesque colorful\
  \ houses placed side by side in matching colors, to the small square where people\
  \ would reunite at night to chat, to the women who sold fruits on little huts by\
  \ the road side and greeted me with silent smiles every day. And, specially, a goodbye\
  \ to Fernanda.\n\nAt first, I used to teach Fe world curiosities \u2013 then math,\
  \ than science, then Portuguese and the list goes on. Her shy outcome and tender\
  \ eyes seemed to be an often and effective way to disguise the eight year-old enthusiasm\
  \ and curiosity. In a place where missies grow up to be wifes and mothers, non house\
  \ related knowledge and proactivity shook the masculine universe bases and, therefore,\
  \ were subtly disposable.\n\n\u201CNat, how did Abi learn all that?\u201D Fe asked\
  \ me sincerely, remembering a story I told her about a Singaporian girl who came\
  \ to Brazil. I felt an imaginary sweat drop on my forehead as I wonder what retaliation\
  \ could be chosen for someone who ignites bold questions, even if they are as simple\
  \ as the one Fernanda asked me. I focused on answering in it the best way I could.\n\
  \n\u201CYou see, even though she had many adversities in her way, she never stopped\
  \ being curious\u201D I initiated, trying to look as composed and assure as I could.\
  \ \u201CShe wanted to learn more and more each day and she searched for knowledge,\
  \ regardless of what people would say of her\u201D I completed. Trying to have empowerment\
  \ through knowledge in a small village on the countryside was an experience that\
  \ I had only lived for a few weeks, therefore I couldn\u2019t know the magnitude\
  \ of strength that was required to complete the task. \n\nBut, somehow, I knew this\
  \ girl could defy it. \n\nAnd then I finally saw her. She smilled in a warm way.\
  \ The kind of warmth that filled my soul, as almost thanking me for my discreet\
  \ fight. Then I changed the dark shaded lens I was seeing through, filled with insecurity\
  \ and disbelief. Now, they sparkled the same sunset-orange that painted my face:\
  \ optimism, faith and, most importantly, renewed energy for more silent battles."
