Text: "My life was exactly like all the others one. I finished my studies as a journalist,\
  \ I was trying to find a job... and my only one wish were to have my own home. But\
  \ suddenly, everything made a 360\xBA turn. I made the best decision of my life\
  \ and I bought a one way ticket to Mexico. And I fell in love. I fell in love with\
  \ the country, I fell in love with the people, I fell in love with the culture.\
  \ And I noticed that the most important was that I fell in love with that way of\
  \ life. Here start the story of my life. My real life. \n\nI gonna tell you the\
  \ story of when I arrived to paradise. I could see the most beautiful sunsets I've\
  \ seen in my whole life. I enjoyed the silence as I never done it before. I loved\
  \ to sit alone in the sand when the dark was coming and breathe pure air. I used\
  \ to take my notebook and write how I was feeling in that moment. It was really\
  \ difficult to explain as it was the first time that I experienced something like\
  \ that. I walked for hours around the island and I never get tired of that awesome\
  \ views. The best was to feel that the routine didn't exist. I didn't care what\
  \ day of the week was because I was happy any of them. I didn't want a bed to sleep\
  \ if I could do it in the beach with people of different countries. People that\
  \ could change the way of how you see the life just in a deep chat. I've met friends\
  \ for ever; people that think like you. People that don't care about what is \"\
  the things that you have to or not to have to do\". I've met doctors, nurses, architects,...\
  \ and they quite their \"dream jobs\" to life in a permanent happiness. And then,\
  \ I asked to myself \"why not?\". I am talking about the island of Holbox. If you\
  \ guys have never heard about that I recommend you google it, please, and I'm sure\
  \ that you will want to go, at least, once before you die. \n\nThe last thing I\
  \ expected when I was in that plane crossing the ocean was that my first long travel\
  \ would change my life for ever. I didn't know that could be what I've wanted to\
  \ do it always but I even didn't know. After three months in Mexico, I've been in\
  \ Thailand, Laos and Vietnam and now I'm back in Spain again and I just can think\
  \ about how will be my next trip and to tell everybody about my travel story. I\
  \ discovered (not too late) that I want to do that to live. I would love to mix\
  \ one of my passions, travel, with the other one, writing. I studied journalism:\
  \ the most beautiful degrees because it let you to be who you want to be. And now\
  \ I have the choice to do it."
