Text: "March 18, 2016 was the day I knew I had met a friend for life. I was on the\
  \ way to Belize on a G Adventures tour. It was my first organized tour and with\
  \ very little planning I had booked a 16-day tour starting in Mexico and ending\
  \ in Guatemala. I missed the entire first day of the tour, and most importantly\
  \ I missed the greeting dinner where everyone met and started to make friends. I\
  \ struggled to make a connection with anyone during my time in Mexico. Luckily,\
  \ this would all change the next day.\n\nIt was hot, muggy, and I was impatient\
  \ to get on a ferry that would take us from Mexico to Caye Caulker, Belize. I looked\
  \ over to see someone from my tour, Cassie, looking miserable. She was having her\
  \ hair braided in a very aggressive manner, and I have never seen such a mixture\
  \ of emotions on anyone\u2019s face; a true combination of pain, horror and pure\
  \ regret.  I couldn\u2019t stop looking at Cassie and as awful as it sounds, I was\
  \ very entertained. I knew immediately this was someone who would fit in with me\
  \ perfectly.  Cassie got up from her chair and I immediately offered her one of\
  \ my beers. She was thrilled and regaled me with the tale of how the \u201Cincident\u201D\
  \ had cost her $45US and the loss of about 584 strands of hair. I found her so charming\
  \ and from that moment forward, we were inseparable. \n\nThis might seem like a\
  \ silly story about an unremarkable event, but because of it, I met one the truest\
  \ and best friends I have ever had. While I knew I would have fun on the tour, meet\
  \ new people and have adventures, the last thing I expected was to meet someone\
  \ like Cassie. Because of her, I have travelled to places and experienced things\
  \ I had never even given a thought to before.  I had never had interest in going\
  \ to Ireland, but Cassie convinced me to meet her there and it was one of the most\
  \ amazing trips I have ever had! The people were so friendly and I could not believe\
  \ how beautiful it was, and I\u2019m so grateful she convinced me to join her. \
  \ \nCassie is one of the strongest and bravest people I know, always persevering\
  \ and staying true to herself. She has inspired me to do the same and has taught\
  \ me to make tough decisions and believe in myself. I reflect often on that hair\
  \ braiding day at the ferry, think how much this one event has changed my life,\
  \ and reminds me that connections can be made anytime, anywhere, with anyone."
