Text: "This year for me started with good news that my cousin Hansja has decided to\
  \ tie knots. In India, wedding isn\u2019t a one day business; it has a marathon\
  \ of ceremonies that run over a week, marked with the presence of the relatives.\
  \ As every relative we also made train reservations. The wedding was going to be\
  \ held in the home town of my aunt and uncle, Hoshangabad, a very beautiful place\
  \ in Madhya Pradesh, India.I was thrilled about the upcoming trip and shopped to\
  \ look graceful and traditional. The day of departure finally came, and believe\
  \ me though the flights are luxurious, there is no match of the experience you will\
  \ have in a train, with all the cousins and relatives journey is really fun. It\
  \ turned out that Helen was a very dear friend of my cousin and she has come all\
  \ over from Holland to attend the wedding. Helen had a charming personality, smart,\
  \ outright bold and so fit that I couldn\u2019t believe that she was 50 years old.\
  \ Just in one day I found an exotic connection with her, it was very interesting\
  \ to hear about Holland, her family, her professional life and how did she like\
  \ India. After my sister left her home with her husband to the in-law\u2019s house,\
  \ we still had three to four days left of the stay. We decide to explore the city.\
  \ Hoshangabad is blessed with the flow of the holy river Narmada. It meanders through\
  \ the city creating mesmerizing views. The temples at the bank of the river are\
  \ very illustrative and speak highly of the past. Helen\u2019s scrapbook was overflowing\
  \ with the pictures and details of the place that we used to translate to her.The\
  \ last stoppage in our quest was the famous Adamgarh hills. It is a rock shelter\
  \ that has millions of rocks, cut and balanced naturally. The rocks were used as\
  \ shelter by the nomads, who have evidently left their marks on rocks by the illustrations\
  \ engraved on it. They rocks are magically balanced one upon the other. Helen and\
  \ I captured the beauty with our retinas as well as with the lens. We climbed the\
  \ safest highest rock, and were spell bounded with the view of the city. The time\
  \ stopped for me, I inhaling the peace of the peak. Narmada\u2019s curves were staring\
  \ at me. That wonderful day has a crucial place in my memories. It made think that\
  \ the world may be full of the beautiful destinations but our paradise is the one\
  \ that we have visited and that spoke differently to us.Well, I befriended a person\
  \ whom I never imagined in wildest dreams to meet. She taught me many things out\
  \ her long life experiences."
