Text: "I\u2019m Akbar Khan and I have my own Travel Blog, FeetforTravel(www.feetfortravel.com);\
  \ a no-filter vaguely chronological space filled with stories and misadventures\
  \ about my travels over the years with some musings about life thrown in for good\
  \ measure.\n\nI\u2019m that cliche \u201Cordinary boy on an extraordinary journey\u201D\
  \ if one is allowed to say his own life is extraordinary at 22. Basically, I travel\
  \ a lot. Usually alone too, that way I don\u2019t have to compromise.\n\nA friend\
  \ once described me as cynical but kind in equal measure, a disturbingly accurate\
  \ bio. If you\u2019re a fan of chaos, brutal honesty, sarcasm and boys who think\
  \ they are naughtiest than they actually are, then you\u2019ve come to the place.\
  \ No, no don\u2019t run away just yet\n\nI started writing when I started my own\
  \ Startup(www.mecurachild.com) when I was 19 and was completing my Engineering from\
  \ SRM University, Chennai (India) specialization in Computer Science and Engineering\
  \ and got graduated in 2017(May) with First Class and now working in Bahrain as\
  \ System and Network Engineer.\n\nI am passionate about things like good food, reading,\
  \ being outside and conservation work (both here in Bahrain and overseas) and believe\
  \ that we are in the world to do good and to grow as much as we can. I like to inspire\
  \ and make people smile (and snort with laughter if I can manage it). Just roll\
  \ with it. If you\u2019re easily offended, you\u2019ve come to the wrong place.\n\
  \nToday I am a System And Network Engineer by profession, marketer, blogger, and\
  \ Story-Teller by choice. I know these three things are totally opposite to each\
  \ other and I also know why I\u2019m following these three things.\n\nI don\u2019\
  t want to restrict my early twenties in one domain and it shouldn\u2019t be at any\
  \ certain lever I guess.I do my Job sincerely with dedication and Passion, I write\
  \ my blog whenever I get a chance and I do research work for my startup and never\
  \ miss a chance to attend any networking events.\n\nI am crazy to live my twenties\
  \ without a limit.!!I\u2019m young and curious about Life.I want to explore more\
  \ and more and declutter all the unnecessary obstacles on my way.I seek access,\
  \ I seek direct information and this is making huge differences because It is said,\
  \ \u201CWhat you seek is seeking you."
