Text: "It was just over a week ago that we came back from our Saigon adventure. While\
  \ sipping a cup of scrumptiously smooth latte somewhere in Johor Bahru, overlooking\
  \ the once glorious Pantai Lido, we started making plans for our next quest. Zakwan,\
  \ who I\u2019ve known since kindergarten and who I turn to when I don\u2019t feel\
  \ like traveling solo, suggested that we go to Mount Bromo. Without hesitation,\
  \ I agreed and we bought the flight ticket right there and then. And nope, there\
  \ weren\u2019t much thinking before we bought the tickets. I have not even applied\
  \ for my annual leave! \nAs always, we only started making the itinerary a week\
  \ before the trip. Since Zakwan lives and works in JB, and me in KL, it was rather\
  \ difficult for us to find a time to sit down and discuss. You would obviously argue\
  \ that in the world we live in right now, everything is possible. Discussion over\
  \ the phone or through whatsapp is always an option. But nahh, I like the old-fashioned\
  \ way. Face-to face, non-verbal exchanges and an emotionally passionate dialogue.\
  \ That\u2019s how we roll. Plus, why rush? Was Leonardo da Vinci rushing when he\
  \ famously created the stunning painting of Mona Lisa? Did Galileo rushed when he\
  \ invented a certain tool called the telescope? Well, frankly, I don\u2019t even\
  \ know. But, I know that if you rush, you\u2019ll miss some things out, get stressed\
  \ over it and probably just cancel the whole thing altogether. The point is, I believe\
  \ our ability to think wisely will usually be influenced by our state of mind. The\
  \ more relaxed you are, the clearer your mind works. Even Isaac Newton was chilling\
  \ under an apple tree when he came out with the law of gravity ;P"
