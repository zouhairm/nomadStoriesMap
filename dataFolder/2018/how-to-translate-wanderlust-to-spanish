Text: "How to translate wanderlust to Spanish. \nI don\u2019t look back; it has been\
  \ 2 years now since we started to live this dream.  A dream I share with my husband\
  \ and my twenty years old daughter and I said share when I should be saying; they\
  \ had no other option but following me.\n\nNo reason to complain; I am the luckiest\
  \ girl, this is what I wished to do for many years; at the edge of my fifties, I\
  \ have no current address, not income, my belongs fit in a suitcase and when somebody\
  \ ask me what I do or where I live, I ramble away trying to explain a situation\
  \ that I don\u2019t quite understand myself.\n\nIt was a burning desire I had to\
  \ follow , work was taking a toll on our marriage and our daughter was old enough\
  \ to leave the nest.  Those thoughts became reasons; and pushed us through a long\
  \ and painful process of ending our secure and successful life.\n   \nEither way,\
  \ we did it! We travel; sometimes as a family, other times as a couple and often\
  \ solo.\n\nBut nothing prepared me for the outcome, why did I changed my stability\
  \ for the unknowing?  \nThe confusing applications for visas, the uncomfortable\
  \ beds, the trains, the buses, the wrong shoes, the hours consumed finding a place\
  \ in the middle of nowhere dragging my beaten suitcase along.\n\nI found myself\
  \ with no plans, just a ticket and the certain of a new day every day that will\
  \ unfold with its own mind, somedays easy and breeze as spring and others hard and\
  \ heavy has a mountain.\n\nWhy I am chasing the unpaved road, the faraway fantasy,\
  \ the places I always secretly loved, but can\u2019t even pronounced?\n\nHard to\
  \ explain to others, but the simple answer is in my heart, where happiness begins\u2026\
  \n\nMy mother language is Spanish; but my favorite word is in English: \u201CWanderlust\u201D\
  \ a strong desire to travel.\n\nThis is why I jumped off the cliff.\n\nA fat catalogue\
  \ of images organized randomly in my mind. Ancient Petra, mystical Jerusalem, the\
  \ awaken Balkans, Colonial Mexico, untamed Thailand, Medieval Europe,   along with\
  \ the new friends, the local wines, the food fest, the laughs, the dance and discovers,\
  \ treasures all mine, my memories, precious moments that warm my spirit, energy\
  \ that keeps my alive, young and healthy! \n\nAll pains, doubts and sorrows go away\
  \ when I woke up in a new place; listening to a new language, trying new food, talk\
  \ to local people, discover astonish sites and have the chance to admire the daily\
  \ scenes.\n\nMy luggage lighter, my soul bursting, my smile easy.\n\nYes, it was\
  \ the right decision.\n\nSylvia Chaves"
