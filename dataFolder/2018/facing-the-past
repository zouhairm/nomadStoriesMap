Text: "The Cessna slammed to the improvised airstrip with a lurch, my backpack soared\
  \ over my head and into my lap as our pilot, wearing a sheepish grin, gave a small\
  \ chuckle and asked if everything was \"sawa sawa,\" Kiswahili for okay. Relief\
  \ was palpable as our team exited the plane one-by-one into the harsh equatorial\
  \ sun, dust whipped into my eyes as my boots hit the ground. Our destination, a\
  \ prehistoric hunter-fisher village, was as our guide Emekwi said, \"Just over the\
  \ ridge to the north,\" and without much ado we began our trek across the Rift Valley.\
  \ Six hours later, we descended a jagged slope of sunbaked black basalt into a bone-dry\
  \ gully that was once a fertile inlet on the ancient shoreline of Kenya's Lake Turkana.\
  \ Known to anthropologists as the \"Cradle of Humankind,\" today Turkana is predominantly\
  \ arid badlands covered in dry desert scrub and sand for miles and miles as far\
  \ as the eye can see. On first inspection, the site seemed unimpressive, boasting\
  \ little more interesting than basalt cobbles and the bones of dead livestock taken\
  \ by the ever worsening drought. Our team split into pairs to survey the general\
  \ area in search of any remnants of past occupation hoping to find the rumored remains\
  \ of a once vibrant village community; Emekwi and I made our way towards what was\
  \ the ancient lakeshore. Traversing the modern seasonal riverbeds, known locally\
  \ as lagas, we scoured the sediment for bones or stones potentially eroding from\
  \ the waterworn slopes. Our local informants had told us of stone tools and the\
  \ occasional animal bone surfacing after the rains, our hope was to locate a suitably\
  \ dense concentration to open a test excavation. The last rain was a month prior\
  \ and now the slopes of the riverbeds glittered with flakes of glassy green and\
  \ black obsidian, a promising sign; turning a bend in the laga I noticed a particularly\
  \ profuse assemblage scattered down the dry riverbank. As I knelt to get a better\
  \ look, Emekwi let out a sharp gasp behind me and whispered, \u201CUso,\u201D- face.\
  \ Thinking some unsavory insect had landed on me I absentmindedly brushed a hand\
  \ across my cheek. Emekwi repeated himself, but louder this time and with a slight\
  \ hint of irritation in his voice. I turned to see him standing over what I first\
  \ thought to be a just chunk of sandstone, but as I got closer I saw it was much\
  \ more than that. Peeking out from the weatherworn laga slope was the full-toothed\
  \ smile and wide, empty eyes of a fossilized human skull, we had found our village."
