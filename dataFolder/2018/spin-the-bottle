Text: "After 10 days of solo backpacking across the mysterious land of Meghalaya,\
  \ cut off from the mainland and in a no network zone for over a week, I landed at\
  \ the \"cleanest village of India\", titled so by UNESCO. The name Mawlynnong is\
  \ complicated, but the villagers really simple. \n\nIt got dark by 6pm. I had a\
  \ lot of energy in me, but there seemed to be no life on the uncemented roads. All\
  \ families had lamps outside their houses, the only source of light. When I was\
  \ done unpacking, reading, and introspecting I was at a loss. My chaotic city mind\
  \ was used to activity and life till midnight. Just then I saw 2 men cross my bamboo\
  \ hut. I looked at them blankly. They sensed my restlessness and whispered, \"are\
  \ you up for an adventure? Go grab your jacket\" and indicated that I follow them.\
  \ It was a tough decision - strangers into the jungle v/s my safe lodging. \n\n\
  I got my jacket, and a pocket knife and walked behind them, as they stepped sure\
  \ footedly through tall grass. What seemed like a huge scam to me was a routine\
  \ for them. I wanted to turn back and run, and might have even attempted so, if\
  \ I was even half aware of the direction in the dark. We finally reached a dried\
  \ up riverbed. The men lit a fire. One took out a bottle of local whisky from his\
  \ pocket and the other, weed, indifferent to my presence.\n\nWithin an hour, more\
  \ men came upto the fire forming a full circle around it, with their own alcohol\
  \ and bongs. It was a ritual to meet at the fire and while away the night. I was\
  \ the only woman there, shivering by the thought of what might happen. They were\
  \ just talking, long monologues each. The guy who led me up to there translated\
  \ the stories into a broken English, desperate to include me into the audience.\
  \ It was a game of spin the bottle, but instead of a dare every gamer gets to talk\
  \ about the most significant things in their life.\nAll my \u201Cbig\u201D problems\
  \ seemed insignificant, and my victories kiddish as I heard stories of love and\
  \ divorces, life and death, kids and parents, loss and money. I narrated a tale\
  \ too, hoping the little man did justice to the translation. I felt myself getting\
  \ more and more cozy under a blanket of stars. We had cried and consoled, laughed\
  \ and cheered, heard without selfish motives, spoken till our hearts felt light.\
  \ The colours of the night changed from black to purple to pink as we shared a comfortable\
  \ silence.\n\nI learnt to laugh. I learnt to trust. I dont know names, and might\
  \ forget faces but I will always remember the feeling of freedom."
