Text: "Suraya of about 15, with green eyes, pale skin and straight jet black hair\
  \ has a gun shoved into her chest. The general escorting the children to safety;\
  \ sternly tells the pack to follow his lead. The long grass seemed to move as if\
  \ the wind was its music, the walk, however long and stressful was still a beautiful\
  \ one. The sweltering heat brought forward warm showers and different shades of\
  \ lightning. Sandra remained calm, in fact most of the people with her weren't at\
  \ all perturbed by the thunder and lightning. War changes you, noise seems to come\
  \ and go. It's like you're there but somewhere else. \n\nI on the other hand, was\
  \ shaking to the point where it seemed as if my knees were about break. I couldn't\
  \ remain calm; I later learned that composure stands for a lot, which I unfortunately\
  \ lacked at the time unlike Suraya just in front of me. We were to cross the border\
  \ over to Lebanon, where we were to be trained for combat. Most of us had lost our\
  \ parents mainly to war. \n\nAs we finally entered the crossing, we could literally\
  \ see the beginning of Lebanon, city lights sparkled in the distance, everything\
  \ looked so pretty, we were ready to start our new lives, I looked at Sandra affectionately\
  \ as we had known each other for the better part of our lives. To tell you the truth,\
  \ she'd been my long lost love for an astounding three years.\n\nJust as we were\
  \ about to grab what looked like starlight, an unmistakable loud bang came from\
  \ the back of a loaded gun and in an instance, our generals time was up, he lay\
  \ there, semi- conscious; looked up at us as if to say, remember all I've taught\
  \ you. \n\nSandra pushed me to the ground, gave me her knife and the generals gun.\
  \ I heard a man say \"get the pretty girl with straight black hair!\" I got up and\
  \ begun to shoot. Then, a silence followed. Suraya had vanished. Running, I suddenly\
  \ tripped over something. \"I found you\" I cried excitedly. Shut up! She said angrily.\
  \ \"The general set us up, he wants to sell us for human trafficking, I killed him.\"\
  \ She said that in an uncanny voice which stuck. She was later killed in battle.\
  \ Now I'm the one carrying her coffin. Ultimately wars just one man killing another,\
  \ nothing but orders, nobody wins, her journey ended far away from home, she was\
  \ always a traveller as most of us war children are. Maybe the only two certain\
  \ things in life are death and taxes, for now all I can say is that I've not met\
  \ anyone who's caught catch 22\n\nWe're all waiting for Godot; we're all finding\
  \ that place."
