Text: "I never thought that it could me onto a continuous persuit towards knowledge\
  \ and experiences. India has been familiar to me since the day i started observing\
  \ and remembering events but it was that decision of watching rishikesh through\
  \ my eyes again with a new perspective which got me started and which gave me what\
  \ i was always looking for, a signal or maybe a stimulus to make me realise that\
  \ this whole societal web of getting educated but not learning, collecting material\
  \ goods but not happiness and the whole quest to fit inn does not makes any sense.\
  \ The moment i came out of water i was in a trance which was induced by the mighty\
  \ strenth, life giving flow of the ganges. I realised while falling in that yes\
  \ its true that how small our problems are and how big we imagine them, when you\
  \ come face to face with death there is not even a single trouble which can over\
  \ come the fear of moving towards death.\nRishikesh, India is a place which is so\
  \ full of life that people come here and never leave and why should they?. This\
  \ place is full of breathtaking views, the holy river ganges, temples and is known\
  \ as the place where 'Yoga' originated. \nThat cliff jump for me was the once in\
  \ a lifetime experience, it got me addicted to adventure sports, it gave me a lesson\
  \ about facing death and as well explained all the observations of me about Rishikesh."
