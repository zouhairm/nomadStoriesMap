Text: "Little India looked different at night, the worn shop fronts gaudy under street\
  \ lights. Tired stragglers shuffling in the heat of the day were replaced by men\
  \ prowling in packs, into the freedom of the night. At every second step I glanced\
  \ back, anxious that the pair of dark eyes that had followed me out of the hostel\
  \ might have ventured further.\n\nI\u2019d hoped to connect with fellow travellers,\
  \ but everyone at the hostel huddled in their bunks, eyes glued to phone screens,\
  \ earphones in. Only Han, an older man from Pakistan, had introduced himself. He\
  \ insisted on cooking me dinner, and even had all of our breakfasts planned before\
  \ I could excuse myself. He kissed my hand, sure that we had a unique connection,\
  \ because, \u201CYou are vegetarian, and I like vegetables\u201D. He lurked in the\
  \ common areas, so I avoided them.\n\nSaturday night and I was alone. Back home\
  \ I could swing by any gig and run into somebody. Musicians I\u2019d studied with,\
  \ or played with before. In Singapore I didn\u2019t know what to expect.\n\nI sat\
  \ on the bus, ticking off stops as they rushed by, swaying with bends I knew from\
  \ the map. I wiped at moisture collecting on my palms, sweat compromising my composure.\
  \ When the bus took a turn I hadn\u2019t counted on, I hit \u201CSTOP\u201D like\
  \ it was primal instinct.\n\nNobody else got off. It was a poorly lit street, bordered\
  \ by empty office buildings, but there was a main road nearby. I sighed, slipped\
  \ my phone out of my travel purse, and checked the map. I was an hour from the gig\
  \ on foot, but I wasn\u2019t risking another bus.\n\nGradually, my path met with\
  \ more cheerful foot traffic, and soon I was strolling down a boulevard of glittering\
  \ stores, dazzling and bustling and lined with status symbols. I laughed at myself\
  \ for not recognising the name. Even my mother had heard of Orchard Road.\n\nMusic\
  \ spilled onto the street as I neared the Astor Bar. The band was jamming on a blues.\
  \ The pianist built to a high point in his solo, punctuated by gutsy thuds from\
  \ the bass drum, underpinned by a seamless bass line. A dozen glass-topped tables\
  \ were crammed into the room, occupants huddled around them in burgundy berg\xE8\
  re chairs. A waitress took me to a seat at the bar, but I shook my head.\n\n\u201C\
  I want to sit where I can see the band,\u201D I said firmly. She nodded, and asked\
  \ me to wait a moment. She spoke to two young men at a table up the front, then\
  \ waved me over.\n\nI introduced myself and we sat, listening. I could feel how\
  \ intently they were watching the band. I smiled, and asked them,\n \u201CYou play?\u201D"
