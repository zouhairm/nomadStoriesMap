Text: "If I had to define that night in one word, that would be her name. Funny part,\
  \ she didn\u2019t mention it \u2013 it wasn\u2019t necessary. She would stay the\
  \ essential to get what she wanted, and she would leave. \n\nIn front of me \u2013\
  \ out of her sight \u2013 some friends have been trying to capture for the last\
  \ week the most wonderful spots this post-soviet land has to offer. Reason, a short\
  \ film \u2013 they are artists. Shining on the lens, our last stop: the Theatre\
  \ Opera House.\n\nHub of Ukrainian culture, this unique 19th century pearl sitting\
  \ at the end of Freedom Avenue, the tree-lined centerpiece of Lviv's historic Old\
  \ City, is known to have witnessed some of the most marvelous spectacles the old\
  \ continent has given \u2013 its most unexpected guest, just about to appear on\
  \ scene.\n\nHer short stature and flawless glowing skin revealed her age. Her deep\
  \ blue eyes \u2013 fixed somewhere several feet over my left shoulder \u2013 anticipated\
  \ her intentions. Then she spoke.\n\nHer fear to a rejection was clear to me, even\
  \ if I understood none. Her object of desire \u2013 to my surprise \u2013 the black\
  \ edgy balloon the caffeinated obsession of this city had brought to my attention\
  \ earlier that evening.\n\nI am off-guard. We both know \u2013 despite it all \u2013\
  \ the reason of our encounter will be soon in her hands. Yet, we tacitly agree \u2013\
  \ local friend mediation up front \u2013 she had to deserve it. \n\nShe is off-guard\
  \ now. It was so plain obvious she would get what she wanted she had no plan B.\
  \ We shrug. I hide my cards. She ponders the situation. Seconds later I\u2019m in\
  \ heaven. \n\nThe strength of that little girl \u2013 that voice. \n\nI shake. Inwards.\
  \ The rest of the world fades away; a world finding at that same moment an open\
  \ armed conflict in the most eastern part of her country. My eyes blur. \n\nLater\
  \ I knew her choice was a traditional Ukrainian lullaby parents sing to their children\
  \ to go to sleep. With the song and her fear gone, the second one came naturally\
  \ \u2013 this time with her friend, who had been waiting few steps behind, on the\
  \ chorus. \n\nMy friends are done with the set; the movie is over. In the Theatre,\
  \ the standing ovation is for granted. Out there, just these little-big girls and\
  \ me.\n\n\u201CLife\u2019s beauty is inseparable from its fragility.\u201D\n\nI\
  \ arrived to Lviv a couple months before the same way one looks for breath beneath\
  \ water. That night, my particular new friends went back home with far more than\
  \ expected. A week later, I headed back to mine with the firm conviction it was\
  \ not the last time we were seeing each other."
