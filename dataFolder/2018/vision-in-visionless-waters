Text: "As the Macanese sky turned black, the city\u2019s personality began to shift\
  \ like a chameleon. The Macau spectacle was coming: millions of flickering neon\
  \ lights in stunning, punchy, animated colours. I was officially in Asia\u2019s\
  \ own Las Vegas.\n\nBut these Kiwi feet had not travelled 9,439 kilometres to star-gaze.\
  \ I was here to envision an architectural design that would inhabit the local civic\
  \ waters. A night at the Venetian, a luxury hotel located near Macau\u2019s waterscape,\
  \ offered us a glimpse into a sumptuous existence foreign to us as students. A monolithic\
  \ edifice, the resort dwarfed the rest of the Macanese skyline with its shear volumetric\
  \ extravagance. Our Italian professor ushered us deep into its mysterious recesses.\
  \ \u201CWe must go to the casino,\u201D he eagerly muttered with glee.\n\nInfinite\
  \ barrel-vaulted ceilings populated the interiors, with colourful frescoes and ornate\
  \ Corinthian columns. Was I in Italy? Huddled together in a pack, the Venetian\u2019\
  s epicenter soon revealed itself: the casino. \n\nFrom tables of black jack to croupiers\
  \ entertaining the affluent, the atmosphere offered a generous injection of luxury.\
  \ The gambler\u2019s natural habitat, the place hummed with a hive of activity.\
  \ \n\nBut this mesmerising veil was fleeting, a devilish trick. The Venetian was\
  \ not ancient, nor was I in Venice. I was in fact the victim of a perfect illusion.\n\
  \nAs dawn broke, the glittering gold started to fade. As a classmate and I hopped\
  \ into a local taxi and drove, the purging process had begun until the Venetian\
  \ had shrunken to an unrecognisable dot. \u201CMarginal da Concordia,\u201D my classmate\
  \ told the driver. We were on our way to civic waters.\n\nAs we drew nearer to the\
  \ water\u2019s edge, a pungent smell entered the vehicle. \u201CYou have arrived,\u201D\
  \ my phone declared in its robotic tone. \n\nThis was no crystal-blue Pacific. This\
  \ water was a murky green soup filled with aluminium cans, dirty toilet paper, lifeless\
  \ fish and other detritus disposed of by Macau\u2019s inhabitants. Along the water's\
  \ edge we saw many barriers: swimmers beware.\n\nThe duality of Macau was now painfully\
  \ evident. Like the chemicals running rampantly into the receding tide, the chemicals\
  \ in my brain started to churn. The currents whispered it with every ripple; the\
  \ locals brought it to my attention with every stare. My vision of an architectural\
  \ design would not be found in the distracting flashing lights of the city's night;\
  \ it was out here, somewhere in the polluted waterscape. \n\nI had found a vision\
  \ - my vision - in visionless waters."
