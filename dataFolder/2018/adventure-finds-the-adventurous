Text: "I really wasn\u2019t expecting much. It was my second year since graduating\
  \ University, unsuccessful job applications and student loans greater than my age\
  \ had stunted the lofty expectations I once held. My best friend though was expecting\
  \ a warm summer. Considering favourable weather wasn\u2019t a British forte I knew\
  \ an invitation abroad was imminent. We arrived at an inner part of Athens, which\
  \ unbeknown to us bore notoriety from attracting the Dionysius influenced; Omonia\
  \ Square. A name we accentuated with lento, teasing each other not to inhale too\
  \ deeply. Yet we did. We inhaled the warm Souvlaki dough that seeped through our\
  \ window each morning and the oven baked pastries that lulled us to sleep come evening.\
  \ A worthwhile break I thanked her for. That too was something the Greeks embodied\
  \ well; good manners. Several months ago Greece\u2019s financial crisis had been\
  \ announced. Infrastructure cuts and increased taxes had moved from talk to action.\
  \ The pending bailout was far from a nationwide panacea since the under- 25s weren\u2019\
  t due any respite. In some regions youth unemployment sat at 60%. Greece, once a\
  \ place where the ancients held lofty expectations now had an albatross nestled\
  \ on its shoulders. Yet that bird wasn\u2019t swaying the Greek\u2019s aplomb. I\
  \ witnessed this one afternoon at Syntagma train station. We were two stragglers\
  \ clenching an arm length map during rush hour. Unfurling it in the bustling crowd\
  \ was cause for conversation from a man in a tailored suit, Brian. He bounced towards\
  \ us with red eyes, perhaps from a long shift or tears, neither reason hid his youth.\
  \ He\u2019d just lost his job but us being lost was equally pertinent, \u201Cwhere\
  \ do you wanna go?\u201D He said with a gentle smile. Within ten minutes we were\
  \ in Acropolis. Metres ahead was the museum, nearer still, a Funbike. Its closest\
  \ description was a golf cart for cyclists. Its awning didn\u2019t attempt to hide\
  \ the steering wheel so I didn\u2019t attempt to forget Brian\u2019s question, \u2018\
  where do I want to go?\u2019 I thought. As I cycled, the streets decided my destination,\
  \ the road bumps my pace, and the pedals that I wouldn\u2019t stop moving. Until\
  \ the traffic jam. My friend leaned from her no- door passenger seat for a better\
  \ view. \u201CThere\u2019s a dual carriageway,\u201D she trembled. I knew there\
  \ wasn\u2019t an option to turn. So, I rode. The motorists 70mph slowed to 7 as\
  \ they observed something birthed from their sun- kissed city. Adventure reignited.\
  \ My feet churned. A smile formed. I really hadn\u2019t expected much; but from\
  \ then, I did."
