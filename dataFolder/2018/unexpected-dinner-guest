Text: "Sat under a brightly-colored fale along the northern tip of Samoa\u2019s largest\
  \ island, Savaii, wrapped in a red, seashell-covered sarong is the last place I\
  \ expected to befriend a group of middle-aged theological college students. \n\n\
  The conversation started with my American accent (or lack thereof) and the patriotic\
  \ connection a Hawaiian woman named Rosie could sense. She invited me to join them\
  \ for a drink. \n\nThey were a friendly and varied bunch \u2013 all of Samoan descent,\
  \ hailing from Hawaii, Australia, and American Samoa. \n\nAs the cold beer met my\
  \ sun-chapped lips, the common introductory conversation ensued; however, this group\u2019\
  s story was anything but common. Each couple was in their second year of study at\
  \ a Samoan theological college where they were living together on a compound and\
  \ studying to become missionaries. \n\nThe women had long, thick, black hair and\
  \ wore customary, full-length, flowery dresses, which drew heavy as they swam in\
  \ the ocean. They described their traditional Samoan thigh tattoos; the intricate\
  \ designs only to be viewed by their husbands. The men wore dark lavalava and vibrant,\
  \ button-up, collared shirts, which softened their strong build, paired with black\
  \ flip flops, of course. \n\nThe royal blue hue of the vast sky grew deeper as the\
  \ enticing conversation, cigarettes, and cold beers continued. They chose this resort\
  \ to spend their weekend away because it was owned by the parents of their class\
  \ mate. This was good news for me because that meant on this particular night, the\
  \ hosting family was cooking a delicious feast to welcome their son\u2019s friends.\
  \ Any friend of their son was a friend of theirs. And in my case, any friend of\
  \ a friend of their son was a friend of theirs. \n\nThe al fresco dinner table was\
  \ filled with Samoan delicacies: taro root, bread fruit, wrapped banana leaves soaked\
  \ in coconut cream and a personal favorite, oka, the Pacific Island\u2019s version\
  \ of ceviche. Our conversation topics were as widespread as my arms were outstretched\
  \ across the table attempting to try every dish. We talked about Samoan folklore,\
  \ the US army, and even medical marijuana. The warm ocean breeze, local fare, and\
  \ good company were comforting that night. \n\nMy new friends were intriguing, funny,\
  \ welcoming, and genuine. They were un-apologetically themselves, yet open-minded.\
  \ They were involved and devout to their faith, yet accepting of other\u2019s opinions.\
  \ Their traditional way of living blended perfectly with their modern way of thinking."
