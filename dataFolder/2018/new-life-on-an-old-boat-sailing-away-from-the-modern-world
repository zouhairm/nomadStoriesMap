Text: "It was too dark, I had nothing to anchor my eyes on. In blindness my senses\
  \ couldn't handle the environment: the damp salt breeze on my face, the creaks and\
  \ clangs of block, tackle and sailcloth under load. The rise and fall through sea\
  \ swell.\n\nI barely knew the other crew. He was unpredictable and I wasn't sure\
  \ he liked me, but I thought it kind of him to sit with me in the dark. I felt a\
  \ moment of comfort when he placed his hand on my back. My stomach twisted for the\
  \ hundredth time. He felt it, too, and pushed me outboard over the gunwale. \u201C\
  Don\u2019t throw up in the boat.\u201D he said. The collision of vomit and seawater\
  \ sent fireworks of phosphorescence past my face and into our wake. It was nice\
  \ to see something.\n\nA year earlier I\u2019d moved to California on the promise\
  \ of a career, which immediately fell through. Stranded in San Francisco I ended\
  \ up working to survive, not to live, and I was over it. I set down my drink, picked\
  \ up my phone, and bought a one-way ticket out of the country.\n\nMy plane circled\
  \ the airstrip in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. With its back to the Sierra Madres the\
  \ city faced westward to the Pacific Ocean. It was blue-grey and flat. The clouds\
  \ cast ambling shadows on its still surface and the sun made one part of it hard\
  \ to look at so I put on my sunglasses. It appeared the same to me as it always\
  \ had. I didn\u2019t understand the ocean like I understood land, so my gaze went\
  \ back to the mountains and I felt safe.\n\nI had two weeks to learn everything\
  \ I could about sailing before the weather let us go. The rest I\u2019d have to\
  \ learn along the way. That second night I learned about seasickness.\n\nPuffs of\
  \ wind will push the boat on its side, so far sometimes that water comes up over\
  \ the gunwale and floods the cockpit. The end of the boom runs its fingers through\
  \ the sea, and the boat rights itself again. One day it doesn\u2019t scare me anymore,\
  \ because I know it\u2019s designed to do that and I trust the boat. I know her.\n\
  \nTwenty-two days at sea and Hiva Oa rose with the sun. I\u2019d forgotten what\
  \ land smelled like. Sweet and fertile. Stillness was foreign to my body so I slept\
  \ in a hammock until it remembered. In a river I washed away weeks of salt hair\
  \ and sunscreen skin.\n\nHer peaks pierced the clouds. An explosion frozen in time\
  \ bridging the sea and the sky. I sat on my floating home, anchored to the ground\
  \ and moved by the breeze, and started to understand it all.\n\nI checked my email-\
  \ I'd been offered my dream job. But I was done dreaming, and politely declined."
