Text: "Recent years executing projects in countries where security risk began to take\
  \ more of a top priority of consideration over the work, I began collecting stories\
  \ where planned logistics were changed at last minute, including routing flights\
  \ due to a bombed transit airport, leaving a location early due to another airport\
  \ in the region coming under rebel siege, and growing threats of terrorism at hotels.\
  \   The local connection was becoming a more narrow opportunity.  An idea seeded\
  \ by a good friend, I decided to take a hike trip in a remote area of Japan called\
  \ Yakushima Island, to immerse in nature and small local community.  There I was\
  \ surrounded by ancient forest lush with intertwining 2,000 year old trees and 600\
  \ species of moss. I went looking for a kayak to rent.  I met a local resident who\
  \ pulled a kayak from the backyard of his house.  He decided to join me. A character,\
  \ laughing and chattering away in Japanese.  An amazing communicator with limited\
  \ common language between us, he started a game making a bird noise, then saying\
  \ the name in our own language.  As we were making a crow sound, a group of school\
  \ children were kayaking up towards us.  He called out to them, pointing to the\
  \ water, and guessed him to say fresh water. The first boy lifted the water to his\
  \ mouth and drank only to make a sour face.  The boy behind him didn\u2019t see\
  \ his friends face and did the same thing, a domino effect of screwed faces after\
  \ drinking salt water. Hilarious! We then stopped at some rocks and he pulled out\
  \ a snorkel set from his backpack.  \u201CLook and stay\u201D he said.  It was rocks\
  \ and clear water, but then little walking fish appeared.  It was one of those moments\
  \ of wonder, where I stayed very still and watched, as they went about moving around\
  \ the rocks oblivious to a body above them just staring. Once back at land, I thanked\
  \ him and waved goodbye.  I went on to find a small sushi bar to eat in the evenings,\
  \ where each night local residents invited me to their table for a chat, and when\
  \ I couldn\u2019t finish my sake the staff would save it for the next time I came\
  \ in.  It was a wonderful experience sharing time with some locals in this intriguing\
  \ little community with extraordinary beauty.  The hike is another story\u2026"
