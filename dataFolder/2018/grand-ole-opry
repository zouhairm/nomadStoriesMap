Text: "\u201CIt\u2019s not showing up on google maps,\u201D Cisco said as we walked\
  \ in circles around a crowded subway station near the Itaewon neighborhood of Seoul.\
  \ \n\nCisco is from Austin, Texas. Early on in our time teaching at an international\
  \ school, we found a kinship between our southern heritage. \n\n\u201CIt should\
  \ be around this corner. Bare with me, I\u2019m following directions from a six-year-old\
  \ blog post.\u201D\n\nBehind the pulsing lights of central Seoul, after the K-Pop,\
  \ the modern minimalist coffee shops, bright cosmetic stores, past the foreigners\
  \ drinking out of open containers, and just at the top of Hooker Hill lies Grand\
  \ Ole Opry. This tiny Honky-tonk looks like someone loaded it up on a barge in south\
  \ Louisiana and dropped it right in the middle of Seoul. \n\n\u201CThe blog post\
  \ said this is the only part of Seoul you should be worried about any crime,\u201D\
  \ Cisco said as he looked up from his phone. \u201CWe must be close.\u201D\n\nThe\
  \ bar sits below a red neon light that spells out its name the way \u201CDouble\
  \ Deuce\u201D was in Road House. As you enter, the scene is a tightly cramped room\
  \ with foreign currencies covering the entirety of the walls with personalized messages\
  \ to the barkeeps. As intimate as Grand Ole Opry is, they still have room for a\
  \ small, but sufficient elevated dance floor. \n\nTwo US Soldiers are pulling their\
  \ dates onto the dance floor as \u201CBoot Scootin Boogie\u201D starts to play.\
  \ \n\n\u201CWhat do y'all want?\u201D asks a middle-aged Korean woman from behind\
  \ the bar. I order a round of Heineken to hide the fact that Cisco and I know we\
  \ belong behind a Miller High-Life. \n\n\u201CWe only have Budweiser in bottles\
  \ right now.\u201D\n\nWe look at each other with uneasiness as our drinks arrive.\
  \ At the table next to us, an old Caucasian man with a long white beard has his\
  \ arm around a much younger lady of Asian descent. He buys her a drink. She looks\
  \ uncomfortable as she laughs at his jokes. They ask for the check and then leave\
  \ hand in hand. \n\nThere is a side of Seoul that most people don't experience,\
  \ and somehow we have wandered into it. It\u2019s a side filled with seedy love\
  \ motels, poverty, and prostitution. In this dirt and grime, we found our roots\
  \ and a reminder that nowhere is paradise. \n\n \u201CThis is everything I love\
  \ and hate about America.\u201D\n\nThere things about my culture I can never escape.\
  \ Certain songs, spaces, and types of people that remind me of the negative things\
  \ I traveled eight-thousand miles to escape. It was there, at Grand Ole Opry, that\
  \ I remember the dirty bayou that I came from."
