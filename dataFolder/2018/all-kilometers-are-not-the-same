Text: "We booked the flights while I packed up my apartment in Boston, while Tasha\
  \ worked an overnight shift in a Denver hospital and while Melissa, in Philadelphia,\
  \ coordinated with her friend in California. For six months, we plotted our backpacking\
  \ route in Torres del Paine National Park based on blog posts. We waited weeks for\
  \ reply emails confirming our reservations from three different agencies. By the\
  \ time we had everything planned out, we felt pretty good about our conservative\
  \ eight-day itinerary on the \"O\" route around the famous Chilean peaks. We thought\
  \ it would leave us plenty of time to take pictures. \n\nWhen we arrived, we had\
  \ a frantic late night grocery shopping/repacking session. I decided to use the\
  \ hotel's comparatively fast wifi to download a GPS app in the wee hours of morning,\
  \ just in case. As a result, we arrived at the rainy trailhead as a bundle of bleary\
  \ eyes and nerves, and apprehensive about the forecast, which called for eight straight\
  \ days of rain. All the blogs had said the weather was impossible to forecast, but\
  \ they'd also said that you could pick up a free map at the park entrance. When\
  \ our bus pulled up, the sign in the window said \"We do not have maps - do not\
  \ insist.\"\n\nThe GPS app ate up my battery, so we used it sparingly just to check\
  \ our position. Luckily, there were periodic trail markers that showed elevation\
  \ change and distance. Slowed by rain, heavy packs, new gear and a general bewilderment\
  \ at the natural beauty of Patagonia, we were glad we'd stuck to a \"conservative\"\
  \ plan, which nevertheless seemed to fall apart when the pass closed on the day\
  \ we were to hike over it. We decided to address this by hiking one extra-long day\
  \ after it opened, which we did. Late that day, when we came upon a trail marker\
  \ denoting just 4.5 km to go, we pushed on. After what felt like hours, we can across\
  \ another one, which read 3.5 kilometers. Our morale fell, and we fully expecting\
  \ to stumble into camp after dark. But just a few minutes later, we saw the roof\
  \ of the refugio peeking up over a ridge. We broke into a blister-impaired happy\
  \ dance. \n\nThe next evening, we couldn't find Tasha in camp and decided we needed\
  \ to report her absence to the ranger. As we peeked inside his hut, we saw her sitting\
  \ on counter, boots warming on the stove. She'd been chatting to the ranger the\
  \ whole time, and had asked him about the perplexing trail markers. \"Those?\" he'd\
  \ asked. \"We paid a company to put them up years ago. They're all wrong.\""
