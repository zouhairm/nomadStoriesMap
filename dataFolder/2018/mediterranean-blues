Text: "September 6th, 2015\n\nA tall gentleman wearing a tailored black leather jacket\
  \ appeared before us. He had that kind of face that stopped you in your tracks.\
  \ His eyes were so deep, a vivid blue as the Mediterranean Sea that softly melted\
  \ into a milky green. His dark tan skin made him look incredibly handsome. His chiseled\
  \ scruffy jaw lifted with a pleasant smile. Every French word he said sounded so\
  \ beautiful but there was a slight problem, I could not understand a word that he\
  \ was saying.\n\n\u201CJe ne parle pas Fran\xE7ais,\u201D I said. He switched the\
  \ dialogue to Arabic. I stood there with a blank stare in my eyes and shrugged my\
  \ shoulders as I shook my head no. \u201CT\xFA hablas Espa\xF1ol?\u201D he continued.\
  \ \u201CS\xED\u201D I shouted ecstatically. Moad use to live in Barcelona and had\
  \ recently relocated to Marsielle for work. Moad introduced his friend Enzo to Andrea\
  \ and I. Enzo was from Marseille and could only speak French. \n\nAs we walked around\
  \ the Au Vieux Port de Marseille we made our way into the narrow cobbled alleys\
  \ that were filled with the aroma of French cuisine, boutique shops, hip bars and\
  \ little markets selling dried fruit and spices. Moad asked us what we had planned\
  \ for the rest of the evening. To be quite honest we were sailing wherever the wind\
  \ took us. \n\nMoad started lecturing us, \u201CNo pueden andar caminado aqui de\
  \ noche solas. Necesitan un hombre para que las pueda proteger!\u201D He was a man\
  \ with a good sense of humor. It was getting late and Marseille resembled a ghost\
  \ town. Moad offered us a quick tour of the city in his car. Andrea and I looked\
  \ at each other and smiled. \n\nMoad drove us around and showed us his favorite\
  \ part of the city. We parked the car at small park at a top of a hill. I felt the\
  \ breeze of the ocean touch my skin. I kept my eyes on the ground to make sure I\
  \ didn\u2019t fall flat on my face as I slowly made my way down an uneven stone\
  \ walkway. \u201CVAMOS!\u201D shouted Moad as he started climbing some rocks. I\
  \ gave him a puzzled look. I was unsure how to manage climbing the rocks while wearing\
  \ a maxi dress and flip flops. Moad starting walking towards me and threw me on\
  \ his shoulders as if I were a rag doll. We conquered the rocks and found ourselves\
  \ standing on a big stone platform right next to the Mediterranean Sea. I stood\
  \ near the edge and felt my toes getting wet as water oozed slowly onto the platform.\
  \ Time passed by as our bodies laid there being mesmerized by the twinkling stars\
  \ in the sky. I felt as if I could stay in that moment forever; I was at peace."
