Text: "The day dawned cloudy on 2nd May, the day I experienced an event that changed\
  \ me and my life. \n\nI went to Tarkarli on a 3-day trip with a travel company where\
  \ I had been volunteering for 2 years. It was 10-hour journey from Pune and we had\
  \ with us around 24 kids. The first day, we took a boat ride on the Karli River\
  \ and saw its point of confluence with the Arabian Sea. Close by was a 'tsunami\
  \ island'; termed thus due to its creation because of the massive tsunami. On that\
  \ particular island, local entrepreneurs had developed businesses of various water\
  \ sports, using the tsunami's fearsome aftermath to their advantage. \nWe sojourned\
  \ in Vasant Vihar, a resort which came with good rooms, delicious food, and a marvellous\
  \ view. The entire establishment was situated only a few minutes away from the beach.\
  \ On May 2nd, we went to the coastline where a boat was waiting for us. It took\
  \ us to the deep waters where we were to experience the thrill of scuba diving.\
  \ Upon reaching the spot, the divers gave us the details on the equipment to be\
  \ used and sign language essential when underwater. \n\nWater dominated the view\
  \ on 3 sides, stretching out for miles with no end in sight. Only on one side stood\
  \ an ancient fort. I was apprehensive and nervous in the beginning about the entire\
  \ endeavour. Though I loved to be in waters, I had never given a thought to diving.\
  \ The kids cajoled me, motivating me to take the plunge. Looking at the faces of\
  \ the children who had mustered up the courage for the venture, I took the decision\
  \ to push myself over the edge, literally and figuratively.\nI went for it. One\
  \ instructor tied some weights to my body to enable swift sinking while another\
  \ revised the underwater signs. And finally, I dived underwater to witness a magnificent\
  \ world which resided so near, yet so far beyond our reach. Silence dominated ears.\
  \ All around me was a vision which filled my entire being with wonder, an overwhelming\
  \ sense of awe settled upon me as I beheld the breathtaking spectacle. I had to\
  \ hold on to a coral, to stay down, whereas the fish buzzed past me, I was overwhelmed\
  \ just to be among those beautiful creatures. \n\nOn surfacing, it dawned on me\
  \ that silence, amongst all sounds of the world, is the rarest and most beautiful.\
  \ There dwells an entirely different universe on this very Earth, ignored by virtually\
  \ every human soul. A huge smile spread across my face. I realised that a life changing\
  \ event had etched itself in my small yet ever-expanding autobiography."
