Text: "While filling in my mission papers I had least idea that the coming months\
  \ would push me to the edge and explore that facet of life which I had never experienced\
  \ before. Regardless of all the apprehensions and fears, I boarded my flight for\
  \ the Filipino capital Manila in 2011. Everything was strange, the food, the life\
  \ style, the culture and of course the language but the only thing that reminded\
  \ me of my land was the familiar smiles of people, yes the beautiful people of this\
  \ wonderland called \u2018Philippines\u2019.\n\nDon\u2019t know from where to begin\
  \ narrating my pinoy adventures. As I travelled to Palawan, I got to taste the simple\
  \ and raw life of villages, yes a life far from luxuries of modern day world. I\
  \ witnessed a family of 10 people living in a single room and surviving happily\
  \ against all the struggles they have. When I visited the tender bamboo homes by\
  \ the seaside and spent time with people there, I was again reminded that a happy\
  \ life does not require a big home or fat bank balance but it\u2019s a choice that\
  \ these people make every day against all odds. One such incident I distinctly remember\
  \ when I visited one such family on one hot afternoon in May. This poor woman had\
  \ 4 young children and lived in a worn out bamboo home. As I spoke to her, her 8\
  \ yrs old daughter came in and asked for food. Getting no response the hungry kid\
  \ got furious and started searching for food and all she found was just a lump of\
  \ boiled rice and a spoon of soy sauce to eat with. On one hand where I felt deep\
  \ sorrow for their misery, on the other hand I was counting my blessings that I\
  \ had often taken for granted. I was literally in tears. But despite of all the\
  \ misery, one thing that never left the faces of these humble souls was their enthusiasm\
  \ for life that I could witness in their honest smiles. They were incredibly welcoming\
  \ people and acted as the best host they could be. During my 18 months in this enchanting\
  \ land, I observed the lives of these people who are working so hard every day to\
  \ meet both ends but have contagious faith in God and life. I am just so grateful\
  \ that God blessed me with this opportunity to travel to this land to know lives\
  \ beyond my own. See the world with a completely different perspective and to learn\
  \ that life is an on-going journey and not a destination so why not live it with\
  \ vigor, faith and happiness just like my these wonderful Filipino friends whom\
  \ I would never knew had not I made a decision to go to that place. Mabuhay Philippines!!!\
  \  :)"
