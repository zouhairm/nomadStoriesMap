Text: "After the narrow squeaky ancestral door, the anteroom had mountains of old\
  \ papers crammed on tables at one side and a variety of scales on a table on the\
  \ other side. Scales and books stacked with large plates and vessels and bowls,\
  \ forming a precarious wall.\nAt any moment anything could provoked this jugglery\
  \ to fall on us. Then I heard Harry say hello to someone with great gallantry. The\
  \ desk he was referring to was at the opposite end of the door and was in almost\
  \ total darkness. But I couldn\u2019t see anyone behind the desk. The voice I heard\
  \ was gutural and deep and I thought if it wasn\u2019t the old desk moving. Suddenly,\
  \ I saw two eyes large, like two windows, opened, illuminating the space as two\
  \ blue glowing lights would, on from the darkness. And I realized that this man\
  \ was probably 266 years old, or older\u2026 He was looking at me in amazement.\
  \ \n\nOr perhaps he was the mirror of my astonishment, at seeing those eyes back\
  \ at me, like two beautiful blue hollows of a cave full of treasures.\n\nSeeing\
  \ me, it seems like he was transported from hundreds of years ago and I felt as\
  \ if I was a dame he was expecting. I also thought he was someone else, such was\
  \ the power of his waiting. And I saw myself dressed in a different era with a hat\
  \ with long feathers. \n\nThe gentleman grew up in height and rose from his chair.\
  \ Dressed in elegant clothes. He extended his hand and I extended mine. His had\
  \ a ghostly texture but with an angel's touch. His hand was transparently long but\
  \ warm. And suddenly I felt that my hand was tiny, light, rough, and without color.\
  \ The gentleman looked me up and down and I felt that I was expecting to see that\
  \ 18th Century lady, wearing a black lace dress, feathered hat, and gloves of very\
  \ fine silk.\n\nBut it was me. Just me. Dressed in a blue shirt and hat hanging\
  \ by the door. It was me and not the lady he expected intuitively. And suddenly\
  \ I saw him again, as he was today, and not the gentleman of his youth, and not\
  \ as tall as I thought. His hands, his head, and his eyes, yes, were enormous next\
  \ to his frail and skinny body. His body was small because it had shrunk little\
  \ by little over the years and I could see it better. I could see one day where\
  \ many days were just one day, for him. And every day he was sitting forever in\
  \ that desk growing smaller, dreaming of the lady, wishing someday to see her again."
