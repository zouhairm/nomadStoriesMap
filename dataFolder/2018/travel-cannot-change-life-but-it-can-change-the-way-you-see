Text: "I began my journey by entering the wrong bogie of the train and landing in\
  \ the incorrect Delhi hotel. Running around with my bag, trying not to get fooled\
  \ by the cab drivers; somehow managed to pull off a day in this messy city and arrived\
  \ at the bus-stand for Shimla. Just while boarding the bus, suddenly I could hear\
  \ multiple voices in my head making me anxiousness and it hit me then, that I was\
  \ out for real for the first time on my own.\n\nOne thing you need to understand\
  \ about Himachal is, its majestic and full of supernatural tales. Now, I was warned\
  \ by my friends that Chitkul (3450 m) is heaven on earth but when I saw it for real,\
  \ it blew my mind. It is the last inhabited village near Indo-China border. Streams\
  \ of river (known as Khad) flow all around the tiny village. The fresh snow turns\
  \ into chilly waters from the giant mountains right in front of your eyes. The luscious\
  \ Baspa river divides the snow-clad mountains filled with pine trees and the village.\
  \ The color of this river changes as per the weather of the day. It is sometimes\
  \ blue or green or turquoise or slightly brown if it has rained recently. Its every\
  \ child's first drawing. Just imagine it 1000 times more dazzling. \n\nSo after\
  \ a day's rest, I began my day walking around, acclimatizing and took off for my\
  \ first hike. I was warned by locals of 2 things - one is the ever changing climate\
  \ & other is colossal landslides. Little did I know, I had to face both. After walking\
  \ for about an hour I realized I am on the wrong way & after crossing a few streams\
  \ of river & fences, I finally came on track with torn clothes. I decided to climb\
  \ the mountain instead of following the trail as I was exhausted and the climb looked\
  \ easy. Needless to say it was the most ghastly decision.\n\nHalfway through my\
  \ climb I realized its getting steeper than I could handle & the soil mountain was\
  \ changing to wobbly rocks. Scared for life I somehow reached at the top. It was\
  \ undoubtedly no act of bravery but the decline was scarier. To my surprise I was\
  \ on the wrong mountain again. I was now stranded on a wobbly peak & to make things\
  \ worst could see a storm heading.Step by step I started my descend from the other\
  \ side. Fell 1000 times & got pricked by thorny seabuck bushes every time. Thankfully,\
  \ out of nowhere, could see 2 Israeli women in far distance. They guided me with\
  \ a trail and saved me from my crazy escapade."
