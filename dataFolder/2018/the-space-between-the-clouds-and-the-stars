Text: "We paused at a landing between switchbacks to catch our breath, gulp water,\
  \ and look around. Here in the dark hours of the early morning, high on Fuji-san,\
  \ I saw the trails, lit by hundreds of headlamps, snaking up to the summit. I turned\
  \ and saw the shadow of the mountain\u2019s iconic cone on the moonlit blanket of\
  \ clouds that stretched to each horizon. In the distance, Tokyo illuminated an island\
  \ of yellow light. Over my left shoulder, a small wispy cloud filled the Big Dipper.\
  \ The stars spun above our heads. The joy of my inner child made me smile.\n\nWe\
  \ ascended for five hours trudging up gravel trails and scrambling up the occasional\
  \ boulder. We met the same people at different stops, smiling as we passed or were\
  \ passed. I heard at least six languages spoken. Kids and elderly couples in matching\
  \ jackets inspired us. The first blushes of dawn appeared on the horizon as we arrived\
  \ at the top. We weaved through the dense crowd of weary, but elated, day-mountaineers,\
  \ past t-shirt stalls, men branding souvenir sticks, and the most delicious ramen\
  \ I\u2019d eaten, and staked out a spot on a cliff\u2019s edge. A steady wind blew\
  \ down from the crater. It was about 5\xB0C with a chance of being swept off the\
  \ mountain. A quintet of trumpet players wearing matching white ski suits greeted\
  \ the sun, first red, then gold, as it floated into view. The Japanese in the crowd\
  \ sang songs and cheered.\n\nWe descended on a wide, steep path of crushed black\
  \ lava that switched back innumerable times. About an hour had passed since sunrise\
  \ and the sun was as brilliant as high noon at altitudes where living things grow.\
  \ Not much life is native to the wind-blown mountaintop. I saw neither a single\
  \ stalk of green nor even a tiny insect. For two hours we rhythmically slid down\
  \ the trail, heels first, gravel flying, covering what took six hours to climb.\
  \ The cloud boundary appeared as we rounded a corner. Its bright, white fluidity\
  \ was a stark contrast to the angular, black solidity of the mountain. My friends\
  \ disappeared into it. I stopped. The vapors swirled in front of me, respecting\
  \ some invisible line. Ever since I was a child, I wanted to run my fingertips through\
  \ a cloud. I failed to imagine the possibility of walking into one from above. I\
  \ slipped the glove off of my right hand and stepped in. My inner child smiled again.\n\
  \nOften, the moments that fill me with joy are not waiting on the mountaintop. They\
  \ appear on a lucky day when the weather\u2019s just right and I stop, take a breath,\
  \ and see."
