Text: "It was raining when I landed and, as I discovered later that day, the country\
  \ was in the middle of a cyclone, but was happy smelling home through the wet air.\n\
  I was arriving from California and, being my first time there, I was curious about\
  \ the country. I planned to go to Silicon Valley, Hollywood and hopefully Yosemite\
  \ Park, simply expecting to be amazed all along!\nThe dream destination that is\
  \ the  U.S. represented the termination of my grandparents\u2019 migration, the\
  \ homeland of the summer of love and gay rights fight, the centre of American cinema\
  \ production, a swarming source of revolutionary and life-changing ideas\u2026\n\
  Yet in all of this, there was also an organized symbiosis with poverty which had\
  \ its own unique features. A variety of men and women, mirror of the melting pot\
  \ of ethnicities, ages and social classes, were living on the streets. The side\
  \ B of the American dream displayed a population of unpredictable monologuists,\
  \ giving their show away for free. Mumbling or screaming, among the crowds, walking\
  \ like zombies and moving in spurts, like half lifeless.\nI was traveling solo and\
  \ was scared. Citing the poet R.W. Emerson, \u201CFear always springs from ignorance\u201D\
  . So I started to look for answers that explained the life of those funambulists\
  \ between visionary and crazy, existence and sleep, aggression and sufferance.\n\
  I wandered around that sort of packed open-air psychiatric institute and noticed\
  \ people\u2019s eyes. They carried the fire of life as well as the resignation of\
  \ death, blinking like neon lights.\nInspired by the surroundings and already too\
  \ far away from my comfort zone, I ran into a giant skull at the entrance of the\
  \ Museum of Death, in Hollywood, and I entered.\nSurely standing out the mainstream,\
  \ I suddenly realised how that place was in resonance with the soul of that part\
  \ of the world. Betimes gore and cruel, betimes peaceful and compassionate.\nThe\
  \ theme of death was developed around two opposite definitions: death as an instant,\
  \ but also as eternity.\nA different logic was disclosed there, showing a universe\
  \ where some contrasts, that look irreconcilable to all appearances, instead can\
  \ cohexist.\nThis sense of cohesion echoed in me strongly one night, on an intercity\
  \ bus full of people I saw struggling for a living just some hours before. That\
  \ context answered all my questions, washing away our differences. It made me realise\
  \ we share the same air on this planet, filling me with so much empathy that, for\
  \ that night, I felt homeless too."
