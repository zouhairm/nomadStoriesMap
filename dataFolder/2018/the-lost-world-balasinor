Text: "I opened the car window to take in the sights and smells, and promptly closed\
  \ it. I had forgotten that I was in India. Weary bullocks hitched to wooden carts\
  \ plodded alongside us, and those smells I could do without. It usually takes one\
  \ and a half hours to get from Ahmedabad to Balasinor in Gujarat, but the dilapidated\
  \ four-wheel drive made short work of it.\n\nThe car stormed through a local market,\
  \ scattering goats and scrawny chickens. We stopped several times to ask for directions\
  \ to the Nawab\u2019s Palace. I was booked at the Garden Palace Hotel, a heritage\
  \ property run by the rulers of Balasinor, the Babi family. Nestled in the tiny,\
  \ nondescript town of Balasinor in Gujarat, is what is known as India\u2019s Jurassic\
  \ Park. A local village called Raiyoli is home to the one of the largest dinosaur\
  \ fossils sites in the world! The Raiyoli site is 20 minutes away from the palace\
  \ hotel, and Princess Aaliya is the enthusiastic promoter and protector of the dinosaur\
  \ legacy. Known as \u2018the Dinosaur Princess\u2019, she conducts tours to the\
  \ site, as she is the only English-speaking guide around, who knows all about the\
  \ history of the fossils.\n\nOn our ride to the excavation site, the princess gave\
  \ me a quick background. The site was discovered accidentally in 1981 when geologists\
  \ were conducting a mineral survey of the area. Since then, researchers have uncovered\
  \ fossils of about 1,000 dinosaur eggs, making Raiyoli the third largest hatchery\
  \ in the world. Paleontologists believe that 7 species of dinosaur lived here. \n\
  We drove over bumpy dirt roads and entered a barren rocky stretch of land, enclosed\
  \ by a neglected fence. The princess pointed out various rocks. I could see part\
  \ of a limb embedded in a rock surface, in another-supposed fossilized remains of\
  \ skin and other bones. She showed me fossilized egg rings, which looked like little\
  \ round engravings on the surface of the rocks. \n\nBack at the palace, she let\
  \ me see her personal collection \u2013 pieces of bone fossils and a 65-million\
  \ year old dinosaur egg fossil, which I held in my hands. It was basically a heavy\
  \ egg shaped rock, worn in places where you could see the eggshell underneath. For\
  \ someone who grew up watching Steven Spielberg\u2019s Jurassic Park, this was the\
  \ defining moment of my trip.\n\nRaiyoli is the only site in the world where tourists\
  \ can actually touch the dinosaur remains, and hold fossils in their hands. From\
  \ relics to royalty, Balasinor is one of the undiscovered, unexploited wonders that\
  \ is India."
