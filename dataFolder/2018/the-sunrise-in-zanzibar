Text: "The sunset in Zanzibar is no small affair. It is a grandiose, orchestral event\
  \ that grasps the breath in your throat. The Sun begins with an 'ahem'. As he descends,\
  \ the Sky laments his death with deep reds and glorious oranges. I have a front\
  \ row seat to the performance from the white sands of Kendwa beach. It\u2019s a\
  \ show long anticipated at the end of each day I\u2019ve been here. But tonight,\
  \ I want more. \n\nMy father told me the secret to finding the soul of a place was\
  \ to catch it in the earliest hours of dawn, to watch the stirrings of life slowly\
  \ awaken its spirit. Taking this perhaps a little too seriously, I decided to stay\
  \ up all night to catch the precise second the African Sun peeked back above the\
  \ horizon.\n\n\u201CWhy not just wake up early to see it?\u201D my more mentally\
  \ sound friend suggests.\n\n\u201CNo,\u201D I say, \u201Ca sunset is an easy thing\
  \ to see, but a sunrise must be earned.\u201D\n\nSo, I settle on the beach with\
  \ toothpicks in hand to prop open my eyelids should the need arise. A breeze swims\
  \ through the salty tangles of my hair, and the Indian ocean stretches eternally\
  \ in the darkness. Fishermen bring their boats to shore, offloading their daily\
  \ catches, calling out to each other in Swahili. \n\n\u201CMiss, are you okay?\u201D\
  \ My reverie is paused by two boys standing over me. Another behind them plays with\
  \ a football, performing tricks with casual expertise. I\u2019ve seen the same tricks\
  \ from the neighbour\u2019s kids back in Canada. I recognize that universal look\
  \ of determination, that glowing pride in perfecting a kick. \n\nThe boys sit, and\
  \ we curiously peek into each other\u2019s lives. I tell them I\u2019m waiting for\
  \ the sun to rise; they tell me they work at a hotel next door to pay for their\
  \ studies at the local university. One boy, with a gentle innocence, starts to bury\
  \ my legs in the sand as the other tells me about his newborn daughter. He gives\
  \ a resigned sigh as he complains about what a pain his daughter\u2019s mother is,\
  \ but the shadow of a shy smile threatens to reveal his inner tenderness. \n\nThe\
  \ boys stay a while longer, showing off tricks with the football, laughing and kicking\
  \ up sand as they run. When the time comes, they say goodbye and in the heaviness\
  \ of night I am alone, with only the sound of waves and my thoughts for company.\
  \ \n\nThe sunrise in Zanzibar is no small affair. The Sun tip-toes in with a humble\
  \ clear of the throat, and the Sky welcomes him with golden hues and pastel pinks.\
  \ It is soft and gentle, like the unexpected kindness of a stranger asking if you're\
  \ okay."
