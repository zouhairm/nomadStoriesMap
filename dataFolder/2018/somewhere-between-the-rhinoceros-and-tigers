Text: "From an old, wooden canoe I eyed off the large rhinoceros blocking our path\
  \ downstream. Whilst my steely glare was about as threatening as a small kitten,\
  \ the confrontation was intense.\nEarlier, our Nepalese guide, Nabin, had been frank\
  \ with us, \u201CWe will look for birds and deer. If we see a crocodile, well, that\
  \ is wonderful.\u201D No mention of river blocking Rhino\u2019s in his short but\
  \ inspirational speech. Nor, for that matter, any explanation of escape routes.\
  \ Sitting in a boat in knee deep water, I had convinced myself I was certain to\
  \ not see a thing.\nWe were in Chitwan National Park in southern Nepal. The dense,\
  \ green jungle we were surrounded by was in stark contrast to the mighty Himalayas\
  \ the country was more renowned for. Trading in cool mountain climates for hot,\
  \ humid jungle was not something I was expecting.\n\u201CLook at this! I have never\
  \ seen this before! So special,\u201D exclaimed Nabin as the Nepalese men, guiding\
  \ our boat with gondola poles, steered us to the safety of the river bank.\nWe stared\
  \ at him as he posed for us, very aware of our presence and none too impressed by\
  \ the spectacle. He had no doubt seen a boat load of tourists before, but this was\
  \ our first rhinoceros.\nNabin was in awe. His beaming smile belittled his small\
  \ stature. His joy infectious.\nWe sat, watching for what seemed an eternity; not\
  \ sure if we were waiting or simply enjoying the moment. What was certain, however,\
  \ was that the mood was changing. The guides became restless; talking to each other\
  \ with increased fervour, until Nabin ordered us off the boats, declaring it was\
  \ time to leave. \u201CHe is getting angry. Please follow me,\u201D the furrow on\
  \ his brow confirming his concern.\nOn the bank we formed a line behind our pint\
  \ sized leader. Armed only with a bamboo stick we traipsed into the jungle. \u201C\
  There are tigers here, but that\u2019s OK,\u201D he said brandishing his stick above\
  \ his head like a knight before battle, a permanent smile across his face. Bamboo\
  \ sticks, it seems, are powerful weapons, although their effectiveness on a charging\
  \ rhino or tiger was unconfirmed.\nI soon realised that worrying about what was\
  \ around me was futile. The jungle was teeming with life; you could hear the birds\
  \ in the trees and the deer fleeing as we approached. Everything alive, but nothing\
  \ seen.\nI spied an opening up ahead that didn\u2019t match the landscape. In it\
  \ the locals were playing a game of football and on the other side, a road. Safety.\n\
  The Nepal you don\u2019t read about- wild and free- resides in the south."
