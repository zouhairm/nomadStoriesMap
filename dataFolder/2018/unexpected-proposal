Text: "It is said that you can fall in love with the city, but never mutuality. Walking\
  \ around the most popular street in Barcelona I didn\u2019t feel that way. This\
  \ city was giving me back all the love. Every part of my body was sure, I belonged\
  \ to this place. \nI know that Beatles was singing \u201Call you need is love\u201D\
  , based on my experience however, unfortunately we need something more to survive.\
  \ All you need is food. With my girlfriends we decided to visit La Boqueria, very\
  \ old and colorful market on La Rambla Street, looking for something to eat. Amazing\
  \ place where everything is so intensive. You look at fruits, hams, nuts, sweets\
  \ and you know that everything is delicious and fresh. All you need is just to give\
  \ a try. Strawberries with banana, papaya with oranges, mango with melon \u2013\
  \ what is the favorite mix for today? Sip of joy, spoon of pleasure, cup of happiness?\
  \ \nAntoni Gaudi, the best known practitioner of Catalan Modernism, left his footprints\
  \ on the sand of time in this city. It is impossible to not notice that. Buildings,\
  \ cafes, parks, street art with his specific tiles without traditional straight\
  \ lines, all irregular and wavy but still so elegant and fascinating. \nGirls, I\u2019\
  m starving! \u2013 said one of my friends. I was right, food is so important. You\
  \ cannot leave this city without trying Paella. We picked one restaurant in La Barceloneta\
  \ area. The food was lovely, waiters friendly and handsome. \nWe were just about\
  \ to leave when someone stopped us. \n-Sorry Madam, can I speak to you? \u2013 charming\
  \ man in black suits approached me. \n-Yes, what is going on? \n- I was looking\
  \ at you, my apologies, but you are gorgeous.  Will you marry me or maybe we can\
  \ just go out tonight?\nI was shocked. First what came to my mind was: \u201Cis\
  \ he nuts\u201D? Second thought, attractive, handsome and exotic, how lucky am I?\
  \  Every dog has his day. \n- You know me only 5 minutes, it is impossible to merry\
  \ a stranger! And tomorrow I have my flight back home. \n- What a pity! May I invite\
  \ you and your friends for tonight dance show in my restaurant? Last night in Barcelona\
  \ should be unforgettable!\n- Yes, yes, yes!!! \nThat was last thing I expected.\
  \ We had amazing last night in Barcelona with full of salsa dance, delicious tapas\
  \ and Sangria wine. We left this city with open harts, smile on our faces and suntan.\
  \ I will never forget this remarkable time in capital of Catalonia. Barcelona is\
  \ the city where you can find joy, happiness and maybe love of your life. I\u2019\
  ve found everything!"
