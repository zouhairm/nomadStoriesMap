Text: "The Norwegian sun was starting to set on Trolltunga and I needed to get to\
  \ the summit before it did so, otherwise this whole trip would have been a waste\
  \ of time. \nI had been hiking for over six hours on very little sleep and had completed\
  \ a four-hour hike the previous day. That was irrelevant now, who cares now, I don't\
  \ want sympathy now, I was almost there now, feet don't fail me now. The pain in\
  \ my legs I had been battling with quit the fight, my muscles didn't dare cramp,\
  \ exhaustion voluntarily evacuated my body, fatigue was frightened to approach me,\
  \ and if my brain created a single spark of doubt I knew my heart would decimate\
  \ it. Pressure only creates diamonds. I repeatedly told myself. I was sprinting,\
  \ bounding over boulders, the weight of my backpack was non-existent it felt like\
  \ I had wings on my back, I was flying up the mountain. Fuel had long since expired\
  \ I was running on willpower, I was running on the thought of failure, the promise\
  \ of promoted pride and a sheer stubbornness to quit.\nI made it to the summit before\
  \ the blanket of darkness was thrown over the mountain. I had about 20 minutes before\
  \ the fading fireball in the sky said her final farewell and I managed to get my\
  \ photo at the cliff's highest point, right on the edge, looking down over the fjord\
  \ like a god. \nWith the time after midnight I had to start the descent, in the\
  \ middle of the night, against everyone's advice.\nOne foot in front of the other\
  \ that's all I had to do, it sounded so simple, it was soul destroying. Being tired\
  \ to the point of wanting to pass out, I was pushing my body beyond anything it\
  \ had ever encountered before. I got hopelessly lost and had moments of utter despair\
  \ where there was nothing I could do but sit down on the cold, rocky mountain and\
  \ try get a grip of myself.\nAs hour after hour of time crept passed my life like\
  \ deadly assassins scuttling away into the night, it was becoming more and more\
  \ of a conscience effort to keep my eyes open. At around 4am the first of the morning\
  \ hikers began to pass me. I knew I was a mess, a broken body with a backpack, a\
  \ shell of a human, I looked like a starving mountain person who'd been stuck up\
  \ there for ten years and then decided to roll down through the mud and dirt. I\
  \ now had only one ambition left in life - to get to the bottom and climb into a\
  \ nice cosy grave for eternity.\nAt approximately 6:30am I fell over the starting\
  \ line and had just completed one of the hardest challenges I have ever attempted\
  \ in my life."
