Text: "The tall grass flutters with poppies, and cats slink along large stone fragments,\
  \ strewn about like knocked teeth. I make my way up the well-worn path, and the\
  \ scenery unfurls in elegant taperings of pockmarked, fluted marble, and shifting,\
  \ right-angled sections of bold cloudless blue.\n\nIt is late March in Athens, and\
  \ the graffiti-emblazoned streets of Metaxourgio, where I am staying, are fresh\
  \ with greenery and pink blossom. On my first morning, we buy koulouri  (savoury\
  \ doughnuts, laden with poppy seeds) from street vendors, and take a meandering\
  \ walk towards the Acropolis, which peeps brightly down at us from its outcrop.\
  \ As it turns out, it is Independence Day, and the site is closed to the public;\
  \ formations of fighter jets, accompanying a military parade, tear through the sky.\
  \ Local yellow taxis queue at Syntagma Square, and our Greek friend joins us beneath\
  \ the palm trees of a nearby park. We talk about the challenges faced by the refugee\
  \ camps, the short-notice relocation orders, the frustrating lack of long-term planning.\n\
  \nLater, we meet again with some other friends for shared platters and carafes of\
  \ wine, and they express their surprise that I am here for such a short amount of\
  \ time. In truth, I have underestimated the geographical distance; Greece never\
  \ seemed very far from my upbringing at the rain-drizzled Atlantic edge of Europe.\
  \ I grew up absorbing tales of the squabbling gods of Mount Olympus, and was later\
  \ taught about the mathematicians responsible for the theorems in our textbooks.\
  \ In fact, throughout my time in Athens, \u201C\u03C0\u201D is my entry-point to\
  \ the street signs, geometry being the one area of mathematics that, to me, made\
  \ perfect, fully-formed sense. The teacher said that this was believed to be unusual\
  \ in girls and concluded, correctly, that I also did art.\n\nI have continued to\
  \ do art, but lately, my self-confidence has dislodged. When I return to the Acropolis\
  \ on my last morning, alone, I am considering more stable routes, and approach the\
  \ structure critically, wary of the Eurocentric ways in which it has been so relentlessly\
  \ venerated. But when I see the light shimmer on the carved columns, and accept,\
  \ without question, the spatial, visual, and mathematical beauty before me \u2013\
  \ crumbled as it may be \u2013 my cynicism withers away. It is as though there is\
  \ some connection, flowing through time, between the people who made this, and all\
  \ people who make, and I sink to the ground with my sketchbook, hunched against\
  \ the strong, dry winds, and I draw."
