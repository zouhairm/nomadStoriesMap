Text: "Ljubljana, Slovenia \u2013 September 11, 2001. 2.59 pm CET\n\nThe meeting room\
  \ for the SGSI genealogy conference was warm, the speaker\u2019s voice soothing.\
  \ I was drifting off, daydreaming of an ancestral castle when a man burst into our\
  \ room breathless.   \n\n\u201CThe US is under attack! New York City is being bombed!\u201D\
  \  \n\nThe sound of chairs scraping across the tile floor shattered the momentary\
  \ stunned silence. People sprinted to the nearest TV. We gaped in shock as CNN aired\
  \ the first World Trade Center attack. \n\n \u201CA second plane! No!\u201D \u201C\
  I have to go home NOW!\u201D  \n\nAs I scrambled to gather my things, the realization\
  \ hit me. The US airports were closed indefinitely. Flights were canceled. My hotel\
  \ stay was ending shortly. There were no rooms to extend my visit.\n\nI was in tears\
  \ when my phone rang. \n\n\u201CThis is Marta. Kathy, is your family ok? Are you\
  \ ok?\u201D\n\nMarta lived two hours from Ljubljana. Though I had never met her,\
  \ we often discussed genealogy via e-mail. When she heard about the NYC attack,\
  \ she immediately reached out.\n\n\u201CMy husband and I are coming to pick you\
  \ up and take you to our house. You should not be alone!\u201D\n\nTo distract me\
  \ from the horror of the terrorist attacks, Marta and Aljosa bundled me into their\
  \ car for two days of visiting and introducing me to distant cousins. Serendipitously,\
  \ they lived in the same small mountain town where my maternal grandfather lived\
  \ over 100 years ago.\n\nEverywhere I went, people immediately upon learning I was\
  \ American, expressed their sympathy with hugs, tears, and potica, a nut roll. \n\
  \n\n\u201CGrozno, je \u017Eal!\u201D \u201CTerrible, so sorry!\u201D\n\nIn the town\
  \ square, an impromptu memorial sprang up with flowers and souvenir pictures of\
  \ the World Trade Center. Handwritten notes adorned small mementos.\n\nThough no\
  \ panacea to the uncertainty introduced by the unexpected terrorism, the Podbrdo\
  \ town folk eagerly supported me any way they could. Arms opened wide with hospitality.\
  \ I still needed to go home.\n\nAs luck would have it, good luck that is, Marta\u2019\
  s son headed up Adria airlines in Ljubljana.  Dimitri patiently cut through miles\
  \ of red tape to book me on the first US-Slovenian flight allowed.\n\nDimitri literally\
  \ walked me across the tarmac onto my plane. With a hug, kiss and a \u201CDokler\
  \ se ne vrne\u0161\u201D (Until you return), he was gone. I was on my way back home\
  \ filled with gratitude for the Slovenian people.\n\nTragedy bridged the miles between\
  \ our countries. \nSadly my trip was marred by horror.  Gladly, I can confirm \u201C\
  there is LOVE in every SLOVEnian\u201D!"
