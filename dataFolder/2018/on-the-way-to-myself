Text: "\u201CDon\u2019t cry, dear mother, your son couldn\u2019t understand a basic\
  \ thing \u2013 no need to steal\u201D the man sitting to the right of me was singing\
  \ a song, a prison song. \u201CDo you know this one? How about this one?\u201D he\
  \ asked.\nI left all the comforts of Sharm and set out to the Coloured Canyon to\
  \ spend a day with locals, to struggle with my doubts about doing what is right\
  \ versus what you feel. Still dependent on the opinions of others, so scared of\
  \ my feelings, too proud to take the first step. \nI found myself squeezed at the\
  \ front of the car between Mohammed, the guide, who smelled of tobacco and was constantly\
  \ wiping his face with napkins although it was cool inside, and the Fox of the Desert,\
  \ the driver, a thin man wearing a narrow mustache with pointy ends. I could hear\
  \ different languages mixed up at the back of the car, the air in the jeep was soaked\
  \ with petrol and smoke. Mohammed tried to speak four languages, yet confusing two\
  \ words canyon and \u201Ccanino\u201D which means a dog in Italian. \nMiles of the\
  \ even asphalt road were left behind. On both sides of the road mountains began\
  \ to rise up out of the desert. I glimpsed a mountain in the shape of a camel lying\
  \ on the ground as if the animal finally found water and wouldn\u2019t stand up\
  \ until you clapped. \nAfter a three-hour drive the scenery began to change as we\
  \ reached the canyon. After a few moments I was down in a narrow passage between\
  \ high walls of different shades: light brown, rusty red, ochre, with the exception\
  \ of grey-green bushes with hard thorns. I had to crawl under and climb over the\
  \ boulders lying chaotically on the way. \n\u201CGet ready for a water park!\u201D\
  \ said Mohammed. The passage between the rocks was so narrow that I got down like\
  \ on a water slide. \nA one- hour walk finished with drinking tea with Bedouins.\
  \ I sat down on one of the carpets with patchwork cushions. A boy, wearing gloves,\
  \ was standing next to a knee-length table with a tray and glasses on it. The man\
  \ behind him in a long grey robe and a scarf wound carelessly around the head was\
  \ silently tying a bunch of habak. The boy poured some tea from a heavy black kettle,\
  \ came up to me asking just a word in English \u201CSugar?\u201D I tried the drink\
  \ very carefully being told I would feel happy afterwards as though it had some\
  \ supplements. The tea tasted like a mint drink, making me feel sleepy and tired\
  \ instead.\nObserving local people who have less, humbly doing their daily work,\
  \ I felt I belonged there. I knew I didn't have to be someone else to be appreciated."
