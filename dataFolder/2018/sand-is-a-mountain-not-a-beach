Text: "On a coach jam-packed with people, our luggage on our knees, we began the last\
  \ leg of our journey to Titignano Castle, our home for the next four days. We hadn\u2019\
  t known how in-the-middle-of-nowhere the castle was, but as the coach wound its\
  \ way up the mountain (my mum loudly expressing her distress at how thin the road\
  \ was, rarely a safety-rail in place) we realised we most likely wouldn\u2019t be\
  \ leaving until it was time to be brought back down.  The reason for this trip,\
  \ disguised as a family holiday, was so that my dad could give a speech at a Science\
  \ and Non-Duality conference, SAND for short, titled \u2018On the Edge of the (Un)Known\u2019\
  .\n But attending talks wasn\u2019t all there was to the holiday. It may seem strange\
  \ having a family holiday when all three children are fully grown (my older sister\
  \ 23, my younger brother (still referred to as \u2018the baby\u2019) 19) but, to\
  \ be honest, on holiday is the only time we all get along. My siblings and I decided\
  \ to explore the surrounding area. The view from where we were staying was breathtaking,\
  \ vineyards and hills and not too far-off the delicious blue of a lake. That was\
  \ our destination. It was hot, much too hot for my sister to be wearing two jumpers,\
  \ but we followed a \u2018road\u2019 strewn with rocks that just wanted to trip\
  \ you up. It ended abruptly in a field that we tried to venture through, despite\
  \ the scratchiness of knee high, dry grass on bare legs, but it stopped abruptly\
  \ in a massive drop. We then attempted to follow an empty river bed. Here we were\
  \ again thwarted by a distance too far to jump and too difficult to climb. We never\
  \ did make it to the lake. Eventually, bombarded by insects and plagued by grumbling\
  \ stomachs, we dejectedly turned back. \n Every night there was some form of entertainment:\
  \ Suffi dancers, musicians and alcohol. The last night\u2019s event was a drum circle.\
  \ Not enough drums for all, there were interspersed shakers and cowbells. But everyone\
  \ got a turn with each instrument: every few minutes the cacophony would be stopped\
  \ and the instruments passed along to the person on your left. There was no rhythm\
  \ to our banging, just a wild release of beats to the infinite stretch of stars\
  \ above us. That session, out in the open with nearly no words spoken, was maybe\
  \ the closest I was to feeling some of the things the droning talks attempted to\
  \ convey. After 20 years of living in London the night sky up that mountain was\
  \ truly breathtaking, clear and dark and pierced with the light of thousands of\
  \ far off stars."
