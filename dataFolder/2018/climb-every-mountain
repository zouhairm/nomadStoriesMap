Text: "Sweat rolls down my forehead and off the tip of my nose. At least I think it\u2019\
  s sweat. It could be the humidity. At this point my clothes are entirely soaked.\
  \ I blink through the salt trying to focus on the next step. One breath. Grasp this\
  \ tree. Step in that crevice. After climbing for a couple of hours my legs are wearing\
  \ out. I had started out in the lead directly behind our guide, but little by little\
  \ I am falling behind. Minutes that feel like hours pass but my progress is slow.\
  \ I\u2019m simultaneously exultant that I\u2019m in Vietnam and cursing myself for\
  \ thinking I could climb a mountain in this heat.\nWhen I first decided to hike\
  \ through a cave system, I knew it would be difficult. I wasn\u2019t in great shape\
  \ and I knew hiking for two days would be intense. For months it was the only reason\
  \ I went to the gym. The caves were my mantra. I puffed it under my breath with\
  \ every footfall on the treadmill. Caves. Caves. The tour website gave this hike\
  \ one of their lowest difficulty scores. That must be like a brisk walk, right?\
  \ No. This is not a \u2018hike.\u2019 This is a constant upward battle of pulling\
  \ yourself up sharp rocks while swimming through humidity. The Vietnamese are athletic\
  \ gods.\n\u201CWe\u2019re close. Only 10 more minutes \u2018til the top,\u201D our\
  \ guide joyfully shouts down to us. I\u2019m in the back grasping a tree so I don\u2019\
  t fall backwards down the mountain. Dear guide, don\u2019t you know that 10 minutes\
  \ is eternity when it comes to physical activity? He effortlessly hops up the next\
  \ rock in his sandals like a dancer. I get the feeling that he is moving much slower\
  \ for our sake. The nice British couple hang back with me. They put their hands\
  \ on their hips and act like they\u2019re trying to catch their breath but I know\
  \ they\u2019re just checking that I\u2019m not going into cardiac arrest. I gesture\
  \ for them to go ahead and force myself to move forward. My hands are bleeding because\
  \ I slipped a few too many times and didn\u2019t wear the gloves I was provided.\
  \ Ignoring the pain, I move forward keeping my eyes on everyone\u2019s backsides\
  \ like a beacon of hope. One by one their posteriors disappear over a rock on the\
  \ horizon. This is the peak. One step forward. Hold these roots. Don\u2019t vomit.\
  \ I pull myself, trembling up over the final rock, triumphant and nearly dead. \
  \ I can\u2019t believe I made it. I hold my hands up behind my head catching my\
  \ breath and enjoying the view. A mixture of tears and sweat roll down my cheek.\
  \ \u201CAll right!\u201D says our guide. \u201CThat was Baby Hill. Who\u2019s ready\
  \ for the mountain?\u201D"
