Text: "Dear Granada,thanks for your welcome!\nIt was a really long day nevertheless\
  \ I loved it.So let\u2019s try to win the tiredness and impress these memories \u2018\
  till they\u2019re fresh.\nI landed at Madrid\u2019s airport at about 01:15;I didn\u2019\
  t sleep on the plane so I placed my hopes on the bus.I was right.\nWhen I opened\
  \ my eyes(09:30) we were already entering the city!Long journey made fast.\nFinding\
  \ the hostel was easy: placed in the middle of Granada,its style mirrors the charming\
  \ atmosphere of the city.\n\u201CI have one day,I\u2019ll make the most out of it\u201D\
  \ I thought while dropping my huge backpack.\nIn the morning I fullfilled 2 goals:to\
  \ visit the Cathedral and to go \u201Cstreet art hunting\u201D. Although I liked\
  \ the first,the second enlightened me:searching for those murales made me understand\
  \ that enjoying Granada basically means to wander around.\nIt got better when I\
  \ reached the Albaicin: every time I turned a corner in the Arab neighborhood there\
  \ was something nice to see:gardens,buildings,the massive Alhambra showing its best\
  \ side.Then I started to make friends.\nIt was about 18:30 and my will was to climb\
  \ up the hill:over the Albaicin and the Gipsy quarter stands the Mirador San Miguel.My\
  \ reward would have been the best sunset ever.\nCool thing about Granada is that\
  \ it feels like a \u201Chippie city\u201D: everyone is willing to share his mind,help\
  \ out or just share a beer together,between perfect strangers,in friendship.This\
  \ feeling reached its climax at the Mirador.\nI guess we\u2019re not meant to be\
  \ able of unfold everything in our lives:so was that sunset,a feeling of happiness\
  \ I can\u2019t explain.Indeed no word was necessary.\n\xABChico! Hey chico!\xBB\
  \ My thoughts were interrupted:a young man was asking me for help so I turned.Well,I\
  \ ended up at his cave house(typical of Andalusia) disassembling an heavy armchair\
  \ he couldn\u2019t carry all by himself.As a reward for my kindness Cal(the guy)\
  \ offered me dinner.And I had a party invitation too.\nCrazy!After a quick shower\
  \ at the hostel I met with him and we headed for his friend\u2019s flat.It was full\
  \ of people coming from all over the planet.A multiethnic environment, anyone could\
  \ somehow manage to understand each other.Between beers and guitars,we all became\
  \ friends.We talked out our dreams,our lives,we discussed and laughed all together.\n\
  Now I\u2019m here on my bed and I realize how good was today.I don\u2019t want to\
  \ forget it.\nToday\u2019s beauty reminds me why I love to travel.\nEl Geco Verde\
  \ awaits me:let\u2019s take a rest.Adventure will begin again tomorrow,under the\
  \ andalusian sky."
