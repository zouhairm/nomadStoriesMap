Text: "An impulse decision, a fleeting moment of bravery was all it took to have my\
  \ passage to anywhere else booked and in my hands. A child of the Midwest facing\
  \ the California sun in all of its immense glory \u2013 it was what all of my daydreams\
  \ were of for the past year and a half. \n\nI stood at the edge of the ocean (right\
  \ where the water was starting to thin out over the sand) and allowed the ice-cold\
  \ Pacific waters to focus my attention in the present moment. I curled my toes deeper\
  \ into the sand and felt the warmth on my face as I closed my eyes. I felt the spray\
  \ of the ocean lightly across my face \u2013 a misting just cool enough to counteract\
  \ the sun\u2019s heat. I smelled salt, sunscreen and seaweed in the air. I heard\
  \ children and adults alike laughing as they allowed themselves to relax into the\
  \ summer day\u2019s slow cadence. I felt like I was on the edge of the world. \n\
  \nI opened my eyes, and squinted against the bright expanse of impressive waters.\
  \ They stretched for endless miles past the reaches of my vision. California always\
  \ held the promise of freedom for me. The relaxed atmosphere, the sunny days, and\
  \ the idea that someone could completely recreate his or her life upon arrival to\
  \ the state were so enticing to me. Of course a person could recreate their life\
  \ anywhere, but in California the idea seems much more possible. California \u2013\
  \ the land of achieved dreams and lives well lived. The state in which nobody seemed\
  \ to fail or fall prey to depression, like the rest of us poor souls living under\
  \ inches of snow in the winter months. \n\nI unscrewed the plastic top on my water\
  \ bottle and took a measured drink. I felt my body begin to relax, my shoulders\
  \ lowering and my jaw losing its long held tension. My pale skin was soaking in\
  \ the sun\u2019s rays like a sponge. I felt at peace with myself for the first time\
  \ in a long time. On this beach, under this sun was when I decided I needed to see\
  \ the world. I lived for the excitement and the escape that traveling to a different\
  \ place offered. I longed to meet people of all different cultures, and to really\
  \ understand them. I wanted to experience a different way of life than my own."
