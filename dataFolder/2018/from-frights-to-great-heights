Text: "800 meters in the air, standing in a wooden cabin looking out into the blue\
  \ sky and down onto trees. Feeling in awe at the view and anticipating what was\
  \ yet to come, as I was shaking I took a deep breath. \n\nWith this decision, I\
  \ did something I never expected I would do. \n\nDuring May 2016 in Punta Cana,\
  \ Dominican Republic with my mom, older sister and twin brother, we made the decision\
  \ to go on an excursion and zip line. \n\nRegardless of my huge fear of heights\
  \ I could either overcome that fear or risk losing out on this unique experience.\
  \ When we got to the camp I slowly walked towards a stone building for instructions.\
  \ \n\nWith my nerves at an all-time high, I needed to use the bathroom before being\
  \ squeezed into the harness. \n\nWith my legs in the tight straps, my helmet strapped\
  \ under my chin, and a glove on my right hand to slow down my speed, I was ready\
  \ to put some trust in something other than myself. \n\nGliding down, I heard many\
  \ sounds surrounding me. Metal on metal as I had to slow myself down, the chirps\
  \ of nature and my family cheering and laughing which got quieter as I approaching\
  \ the next cabin. I started smiling and enjoying myself. \n\nAt the moment, I felt\
  \ this rush throughout my entire body and pure joy. My senses were on high alert.\
  \ I saw green treetops set against a blue sky and sunshine, and at times it passed\
  \ in fast motion. The day was humid, but the wind I was flying through was pleasant\
  \ and smelt fresh. \n\nThe rush continued as two men in green polo shirts were to\
  \ catch and unhook me as they directed me to the next course. \n\nI was lucky I\
  \ was to experience such a journey. I was thrilled and eager to go from one higher\
  \ platform to the next and take the chance to push boundaries. \n\nAnyone who takes\
  \ part is safe and taken care of by pure professionals. \n\nThis was a part of my\
  \ trip I will never forget. Every time I see a picture, my mind is brought back\
  \ to that day and I relive that experience all over again.\n\nIt is a way to create\
  \ memories with those you connect most. A way to broaden your horizon while zooming\
  \ out towards one. \n\nI just had to take my first jump, that lead to many more.\
  \ \n\nThe adrenaline-releasing experience continued for about two hours but eventually\
  \ had to come to an end. With great gratitude for my mother who organized this,\
  \ she encouraged me to try something I never thought I would and now suggest it\
  \ to everyone I know. My next goal is to build myself up to skydive one day."
