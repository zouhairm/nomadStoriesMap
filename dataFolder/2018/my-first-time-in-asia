Text: "This territory was completely unfamiliar and I did not know how to navigate\
  \ it. I nervously walked through my mental abyss down to the baggage carousels.\
  \ I have never experienced such intense relief when I saw my two friends pull their\
  \ backpacks off the carousel that had just arrived from India. I had been waiting\
  \ in the Bangkok airport by myself an hour longer than I expected. This was my first\
  \ international trip. From that point on, I learned about how to travel, choose\
  \ a place to sleep, and negotiate. My two friends were my mentors.  I learned lessons\
  \ along the way. Rich experiences come from connecting with a local friend and them\
  \ showing you their world. I learned how lucky I was to go to such a densely international\
  \ school. I learned about the history of these places, but most importantly, this\
  \ trip planted seeds of curiosity that would sprout later on. We had conversations\
  \ about gender, sexual preferences, and the effects of prejudice.  I understood\
  \ how beautiful the world can be at a deeper level.  I also understood how horrifically\
  \ ugly it can be. \n  This trip was valuable because I noticed things I hadn\u2019\
  t seen before since I was some place new. I brought that mindset back with me when\
  \ I came back to what was familiar. I want to see the places where I spend my time\
  \ with the same eyes I had in Thailand and Cambodia. This change in mindset has\
  \ made me more inquisitive, open, kind, and willing to step in that mental abyss\
  \ also known as \"the edge.\" It built my trust in the edge of the unknown. \nI\
  \ continue to look for the edge. I remember attending a networking group after I\
  \ graduated college. I worked as a writer, photographer and editor at my previous\
  \ job on campus, but this was not college. There were business professionals in\
  \ that room and I gracefully dove off the edge when I announced myself as a Multimedia\
  \ Journalist. I talked about my most recent article: A Cambodian young man who shared\
  \ his incredible story with me. An opportunity to write for a local magazine came\
  \ that day and I took it."
