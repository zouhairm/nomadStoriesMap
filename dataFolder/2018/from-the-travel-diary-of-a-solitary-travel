Text: "21/09/2017 near the Kavir desert, Iran\n\nWell, I'm here in Iran. We are now\
  \ in a small hotel in an anonymous small town \nin the desert. The sun breathes\
  \ hot breath, I'm sitting in the inner courtyard on carpets with pillows. My neighbor,\
  \ a good-natured Iranian woman is next to me, she prays, it's time for prayer. A\
  \ fountain sounds in the yard. Time is an hour of the day. Time stopped.\n\nThe\
  \ fifth day in Iran, so many events, people. Today after lunch we will go to the\
  \ desert, the hottest place on Earth.\n\nAll my plans of the trip have already changed\
  \ in the first hours of my arrival in Tehran. I met my birthday with wonderful people\
  \ at the foot of Darband, five thousand of the beauty. With hookah and tea. It was\
  \ my best birthday! I wanted to be alone in the desert in this day but I met people.\
  \ We attract each other. The flow of words bursts out and I understand it - how\
  \ limited this flow is, in order to express in words all the charm and power and\
  \ beauty of Iran. I know exactly that I came back at home. It's same as I come back\
  \ at home in my lovely small town Zlatoust hidden in the Ural mountains and hug\
  \ my mother.\n\nToday begins my new journey. New places, new cities, new people.\
  \ From the north to the south of Iran by night bus to discover the desert and the\
  \ ancient cities. To continue to move to the north back, bottom-up. Up, up.\n\n\
  Iran, Iran, if on the map all countries looked like different figures, then Iran\
  \ is a huge heart. It ready to embrace everything. How happy I am that here, I go\
  \ and see this beauty."
