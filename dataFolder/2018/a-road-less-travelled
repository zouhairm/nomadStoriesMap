Text: "A perfect vacation to me meant travelling to an exotic destination with someone\
  \ special. But after spending 10 years in the same city and never stepping out of\
  \ my comfort zone, it was now or never. With this burning desire in my heart, I\
  \ made up my mind to go on my first ever solo trip. With not much time to prepare,\
  \ I took a night bus to Gokarna, a small temple town in the coast of Karnataka,\
  \ India, which took me roughly 8 hours to reach. Being a leisure traveller and someone\
  \ accustomed to only staying in a hotel/resort, I gathered all my courage to book\
  \ a stay in Zostel, a backpacker hostel. Located at a mountain top and the only\
  \ property with a breath taking view of the sea and open skies from my dorm room\
  \ it seemed nothing less than luxury to me! The sound of the waves was just the\
  \ kind of music I needed to drown myself in. After checking in, I headed out to\
  \ the only market area of the town, Carstreet to check out the local shops and delicacies.\
  \ I communicated in broken Kannada with the locals which they really appreciated.\
  \ Offseason wasn\u2019t really the best time to visit the famous Gokarna beach at\
  \ the end of the street, but I was glad to have made it this far. I headed back\
  \ before sun down and watched it rain over a part of the sea while the sun set.\
  \ I watched a thousand waves crashing in the endless seashore, from my door step.\
  \ The next morning I woke up early to trek to Om beach. I left as soon as I could\
  \ after a hearty breakfast. I reached Kudle beach which was on the way and felt\
  \ a little closer to my mission. The poor network conditions in the hilly areas\
  \ didn\u2019t help much with navigating through the isolated trails. But just when\
  \ hope seemed bleak, I came across a private estate where I met Rama Nayak, a watchman\
  \ who guided me to Om beach. He was nothing less than a guardian angel watching\
  \ over me. After saying our good byes I walked down the steps towards the beach\
  \ feeling a little elated on completing my first solo trek with only few anxious\
  \ moments and singing out loud to keep my spirits high.  Never had I come across\
  \ a beach shaped as number three. Even in monsoon season this beach was a sight\
  \ to sore eyes. I walked barefoot till the edge of the beach and felt a sense of\
  \ peace for the first time on my own. Nothing could mark a better ending to his\
  \ wonderful journey than a freshly cooked seafood meal and a bottle of beer whilst\
  \ being greeted by a muster of peacock dancing which almost seemed like a sign of\
  \ celebration of my little victory."
