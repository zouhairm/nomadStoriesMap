Text: "When my new Malaysian friend invited me to visit her in Kuala Lumpur, I was\
  \ ecstatic.  She was shocked that I knew where her country is, but there is a fantastic\
  \ Malaysian restaurant in Vancouver, and I\u2019d been dying to make a pilgrimage\
  \ to the land of my favourite cuisine.\nRamadan was starting the day before I arrived,\
  \ and I was more than a little nervous about staying with my friend\u2019s family\
  \ during such an important holiday.  But they welcomed me like a daughter and I\
  \ felt truly privileged to be there.\nDuring Ramadan in Malaysia, it\u2019s traditional\
  \ to buy food for iftar (the evening meal) at a bazaar, which is a wonderful place\
  \ with every kind of Malaysian food imaginable.  We loaded up on chicken sat\xE9\
  , nasi lemak, mee goreng, rendang beef, chicken rice, jellies and deliciously cool\
  \ iced drinks.  Since I was the only foreigner, vendors waved us over and eagerly\
  \ asked my friend to describe their food.  The whole neighbourhood was there, and\
  \ my friend ran into more than a few childhood friends.\nFinally sunset rolled around\
  \ and the calls to prayer went off in all the neighbourhoods.  Fathanah\u2019s family\
  \ was surprisingly restrained considering they hadn\u2019t eaten all day.  More\
  \ than the food, iftar seemed to be about enjoying a moment together, a break from\
  \ the long day.\nOur next stop was Pulau Tioman, a paradisiacal island with crystal-clear\
  \ blue waters.  I was excited to be going to a tourist hotspot, where my mind\u2019\
  s eye imagined cheerily open restaurants and cheap menus.  But when we arrived,\
  \ I saw I had been cruelly deceived.  Like in KL, which basically went into hibernation\
  \ mode during Ramadan, most shops here weren\u2019t even open, let alone restaurants.\
  \  That evening, we actually shared a modest iftar with the Muslim family that ran\
  \ our hostel.\nI finally appreciated how lucky I\u2019d been to get a glimpse of\
  \ this country during a time like Ramadan.  The holiday creates a strong sense of\
  \ kinship, because the privation of food is something everyone endures together.\
  \  This level of conviviality and genuine warmth shared between strangers was something\
  \ that I had rarely encountered during my travels.  My whole trip before this had\
  \ been a marathon of finding accommodation, catching transit, ticking off sights.\
  \  Although I\u2019m not Muslim, I can see a spiritual relevance in slowing down\
  \ life for a while and pausing to breathe.  If I can take away one lesson from my\
  \ trip, it\u2019s the importance of appreciating the slow things in life, the things\
  \ that bring people together."
