Text: "I've never felt as free as when I stood at nearly 960m altitude, gazing down\
  \ at the beautiful, medieval city of Bra\u0219ov and knowing that I'd made it there\
  \ all by myself.\n\nIt was my second day in Transylvania, Romania. The first had\
  \ involved a lot of travelling: a three-hour flight from Heathrow and another three-hour\
  \ journey driving on winding roads through mountains and skyscraper spruce forests.\n\
  \nI'd come to Romania to volunteer at the Libearty Sanctuary. The other volunteers\
  \ and I worked at the sanctuary on weekdays, but the weekends we had to ourselves\
  \ to explore Bra\u0219ov, where we were staying, and the surrounding area.\n\nThe\
  \ night I arrived, I was greeted by the always cheery Rasvan, our representative.\
  \ 'You should go for a walk around Mount T\xE2mpa,' he suggested.\n\nNext morning,\
  \ I walked to the cable car with a bottle of water, my phone, some money and a cake\
  \ bar. I paid 17 lei for a return ticket and took the rusty red cable car to the\
  \ summit. At the top, I followed the directions to the Bra\u0219ov sign and spent\
  \ a while admiring the views and the sounds of crickets in the grass.\n\nI wasn't\
  \ done with T\xE2mpa yet. I began to walk down the other side of the mountain. I\
  \ was surprised by the fields of long grass at the summit as the outside of the\
  \ mountain was covered in a thick, dark forest. The grasses were filled with vibrantly\
  \ coloured butterflies, many of them varieties I\u2019d never seen before. I sat\
  \ on a tree stump and ate my cake bar, admiring the landscape that, shrouded in\
  \ late June sunlight, was so unlike anything in England.\n\nAfter my snack, I walked\
  \ some more, trying to find my way down. By this time, I was running low on water.\
  \ I'd already been through 2/3s of my bottle and I didn\u2019t know how much further\
  \ I had to go but I was too far down to turn back.\n\nI passed a friendly elderly\
  \ couple. 'Bun\u0103 diminea\u021Ba,' they said.\n\n'Bun\u0103.' I smiled.\n\nI\
  \ hiked on. Only then realising how thirsty and hungry I was. I was regretting not\
  \ bringing more than one bottle and it became clear that I needed to get to the\
  \ bottom soon. Mountains are disorientating, I thought I was still quite far from\
  \ the base, but ten minutes later I could see the path at the bottom of the mountain\
  \ 10ft below. I drank the last sip of my water and slid down to the path. I brushed\
  \ the leaves and mud from my clothes.\n\nLooking back at Mount T\xE2mpa, I felt\
  \ a rush of pride and grinned ear to ear. I grabbed a cr\xEApe for lunch from a\
  \ vendor on the way back to the apartment, exploring done for the day."
