Text: "Cuba. Incomparable, raw and courageous. It\u2019s like going back in time.\
  \ Only everybody is wearing Nikes. \nAfter a week wandering around the streets of\
  \ Habana, I arrived in Santa Clara. Not sure why, but it seemed a nice enough place\
  \ to explore for a few days. I stayed in a Casa Particular right in the heart of\
  \ town. Located around the corner, one of Santa Clara\u2019s most popular Paladares\
  \ is found. As expected, famous places are busy. There were no tables available,\
  \ so it took a bit of a wait. Luckily, the hostess kept me company. She spoke very\
  \ well English and is about my age. She couldn\u2019t believe I was traveling on\
  \ my own. On the other hand, I was surprised she was a constant student, already\
  \ married, had a kid and lived at her mother-in-law\u2019s. We intrigued each other\
  \ with our differences and she invited me for a lunch the next day at her house.\
  \ Yadira is her name. \n\nYadira and her family lived in a beautiful place. The\
  \ high ceiling and open patio in the middle of her house, ventilated a certain allure.\
  \ She said her mother-in-law tried to make the nicest vegetarian meal for me. I\
  \ almost felt embarrassed. It\u2019s already hard enough to put food on the table\
  \ here and now she even tried her utmost best to meet my dietary wishes. Cuba often\
  \ experiences sudden shortages of a certain product. Today it can be water bottles\
  \ and the next day toilet paper. That\u2019s why I was surprise Yadira had enough\
  \ toilet paper for a hotel, while I know it wasn\u2019t available in any store since\
  \ my arrival. I thought it would come in handy to have with me, when being on the\
  \ road. Unfortunately, I couldn\u2019t find any. Yadira laughed. \u201CWe get it\
  \ from the black market\u201D she whispered. As if someone was ears dropping in\
  \ her own house. The black market? Where is this black market?! She laughed again.\
  \ \u201CIt\u2019s not an actual place\u201D she said \u201Cit\u2019s more like a\
  \ network.\u201D Hotels are the main focus of the government and they make sure\
  \ these hotels are supplied. The employees take what would have been thrown away.\
  \ Like a half-used toilet paper roll for instance, or soap. And then they sell it\
  \ on the streets. I listened with great attention to her way of survival, hopes,\
  \ dreams and concerns, during lunch.\n\nYadira has a completely different life.\
  \ Her worries lie elsewhere. She tries to be a good daughter, mother and wife. Her\
  \ own dreams are secondary. Meeting Yadira and her family humbled me. A local encounter\
  \ that gave me perspective. A local encounter that turned into a three years friendship."
