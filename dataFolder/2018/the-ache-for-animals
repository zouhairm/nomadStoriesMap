Text: "My travels through the Philippines have been punctuated by dogs. They are everywhere.\
  \ Ribby, threadbare specimens, wary of the sight and smell of Westerners. I dodge\
  \ them as I walk, mildly offended by their snaps and snarls when I inadvertently\
  \ step too close. Aware of their unpredictability, I keep a determined few strides\
  \ ahead of the dog following me as I lug my backpack along Sugar Beach.\n\nI\u2019\
  m the first visitor for days. I haggle a quick, two-night deal on a cabin and collapse\
  \ into a hammock. The pulsing cacophany of Filipino life is replaced by the soft\
  \ crash of waves. Palm fronds clack in the breeze. A languid dragonfly drones about\
  \ his business. I drowse.\n \nA wet nose pressed into my elbow jolts me from my\
  \ reverie. Dark eyes regard me calmly from a red face. Like a polite, unkempt fox.\
  \ Gentle. Curious. My pursuant from the beach.\n\nHe decides that he is mine and\
  \ so becomes my shadow.\n \nHe waits patiently by my towel as I swim in the ocean,\
  \ watchful and concerned. Delighted by my safe return he gouges the sand with high\
  \ velocity cornering, inviting a game. He snoozes by my hammock as I read, replying\
  \ to any word of mine with the slow thump of a long tail. He rouses occasionally\
  \ for a speculative sniff, or to snap at the miasma of nik-niks. By night he guards\
  \ my door, his bright eyes and crooked ears alert to the dark\u2019s dangers.\n\n\
  Sitting together, his weight against me, I trace my fingers along the ragged, hairless\
  \ scars on his back. I wonder what hardships make up his normal life and why he\
  \ would choose to trust me. Not wanting to dwell on negatives, he happily leads\
  \ me to the village to buy an egg for his breakfast. He always keeps a safe distance\
  \ from the local boys.\n \nHe knows that I am leaving even before I begin to pack.\
  \ The locals must think I\u2019m crazy, kneeling on the sand hugging a dog with\
  \ no name. But at that moment I don\u2019t care if the whole island sees me cry.\
  \ He sits quietly as I hold him, his little head resting in the crook of my elbow,\
  \ his tail brushing a slow angel-wing. Accepting that he can\u2019t keep me, he\
  \ watches sadly from the shade of a palm as I carry my bags and my guilt along the\
  \ beach. I look back maybe a dozen times, his outline blurred by wet eyes.\n \n\
  As a disillusioned vet, on the verge of throwing in my career, I\u2019ve drifted\
  \ in Asia for a year with no animal contact. Three days with a dishevelled, nameless\
  \ dog has filled the emptiness I carry inside - that ache for animals. Finally,\
  \ I feel whole again. \n\nI\u2019m ready to go home."
