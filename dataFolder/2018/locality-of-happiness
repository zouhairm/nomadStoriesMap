Text: "Stepping off the plane was a moment I never thought would be real. Not knowing\
  \ what to expect leaving the airport gave me a feeling of adventure, and shaking.\
  \ The first step I took felt like relief, I made it to Nicaragua. Immediately attacked\
  \ by children tugging on my clothes asking me to buy little flowers made out of\
  \ leaves. Naturally, I wanted to give them everything I had. I was quickly told\
  \ by our guide to not give them anything. I scurried into the van leaving them with\
  \ empty hands. We were to drive from our current city to the countryside, where\
  \ we would meet our host families. Driving in a van with people I hardly knew, a\
  \ debate was going on in my head whether I or the van were going to break down first.\
  \ I look out the window and see rolling mountains, a slight calmness waves over\
  \ me. We pull up to the last house, my house. It was more indigent looking than\
  \ the others. Concrete walls, dirt floors. I step inside and feel a sense of relief\
  \ as I see my new family. They smile, say \u201Chola\u201D and give me a hug. They\
  \ gave a quick tour of the home, through hand signals and spanglish, we communicated.\
  \ I'd be sleeping in a bed made of horsehair and a huge machete hanging on the wall\
  \ and yet, I didn't care. I was eager to get to know them. You know the feeling\
  \ of one moment changing everything? It makes you think and act differently, live\
  \ and love differently. I immediately changed as a person. I knew this is how I\
  \ need to feel every second of my life. People travel for many different reasons.\
  \ After meeting this family, I realized my reason for traveling was in fact the\
  \ locals. They are the ones that made me understand just how beautiful this experience\
  \ is. Although it didn\u2019t smell great in the beginning, they made me see the\
  \ beauty in it all. We arrived back at the airport, I saw the same little kids,\
  \ doing the same thing to others. Instead of being nervous as I walked passed them,\
  \ I thought about the kids in my host family. I went up to them and decided to give\
  \ them a big smile and a gentle hug. I saw one child running up to me and handing\
  \ me a flower they had made. Traveling wouldn\u2019t be the same without the locals.\
  \ They are the ones who live in the culture you're immersing yourself in, they are\
  \ the ones who live in that multi colored house you\u2019re taking a picture in\
  \ front of to post on Instagram, they\u2019re the ones living in the country you\
  \ spent money to get to. Spend time getting to know them. After all, the beauty\
  \ in traveling wouldn\u2019t exist without them."
