Text: "\"Well, are you going to sail the Atlantic with me?\u201D Rai\u2019s sea eyes\
  \ catch me off guard. \u201CImagine! Turquoise waters of Trinidad in three weeks\
  \ time.\u201D\n\u201CSeriously?\u201D Could I swap the Fields of Athenry for the\
  \ Seas of the Atlantic?\nI came to Cape Verde for sea and music. Morna music. Now\
  \ I was drinking Coconut Grogues with three sailors in the floating bar in Mindelo\
  \ marina.\nTwenty-four hours later I meet Rai for our \u201CTest Sail,\" realising\
  \ his offer is genuine.\nThis is the beauty of solo travel: you are at liberty.\n\
  Why so drawn to accepting Rai\u2019s challenge? I had a good job and a great place\
  \ to live back in Ireland. But I had no ties. After some choppy years, it was time\
  \ to feel alive again.\n\u201CWell! Have you decided on my offer?\u201D As the dusty\
  \ town fades to night, I make my decision there and then. Like a fish to bait, I\
  \ am hooked.\n\u201CYes. I\u2019ll do it!\u201D\nFive weeks later I am back on board.\n\
  \u201CAll sails are up!\u201D Rai declares jubilantly while I manoeuvre La Sirena\
  \ through the harbour and out to sea. As I watch the mountains in Santo Ant\xE3\
  o recede, all that lies ahead is open sea, and a distant promise of the Caribbean.\n\
  The rest of the day goes by leisurely.\nUntil I hear a thump.\n\u201CWhat was that?\u201D\
  \ My radar alert.\nRai leaps into action.\n\u201CYou see those clouds over there?\u201D\
  \ He points North.\n\u201CThe winds are picking up. I need to get the head sail\
  \ down.\u201D\nThe waves slap the boat without mercy. Four meters, growing to five.\
  \ \n\u201CYou need any help?\u201D I call out to Rai.\nThe boat takes a hit by a\
  \ big one. La Sirena tilts so far over on her side that I lose my balance, and my\
  \ footing comes from under me. Bouncing off the rail, in a tizzy, I grab hold of\
  \ the steel bars by the hatch and collapse into the cockpit . My heart races wildly.\n\
  A dreaded feeling of sick overcomes me.\n\u201COh no.\u201D I call out to Rai. \u201C\
  I\u2019m going to be sick.\nI pull myself with rapid speed to the verge of the boat;\
  \ hiking over the edge, feet skimming the water. It splashes up my ankles with every\
  \ wave. \nThen it hits me, as I stare down into Prussian waters, what have I done?\
  \ I was at liberty: totally free, yet a prisoner of my mind and body. Anxiety and\
  \ seasickness have overcome me. I have given up everything to be here.\nMy stomach\
  \ heaves and now I am All At Sea.\nIn that moment a rogue wave shoots over the boat\
  \ and splashes us both glitch nass. Dripping wet, we just look at each other and\
  \ laugh.\nRai flashes me a cheeky grin, helping me to my feet.\n\u201CRight! I\u2019\
  m getting you some seasick tablets. It will take the edge off.\""
