Text: "Uncertainties about road conditions flitted around me like mosquitoes in the\
  \ darkness of the power outage. At 4 am, the lights came back on, right on time\
  \ be of no use. When the alarm went off at 7:15, I relegated it to snooze for a\
  \ few rounds. I just didn\u2019t have the chutzpah to leave the bizarre-o world\
  \ of this Econolodge in South Carolina, inhabited by geriatrics, small dogs, and\
  \ cleaning boys in tight v-necks and women\u2019s jewelry. In the two days I had\
  \ been stranded by Hurricane Matthew, I found myself equally appalled and enthralled\
  \ by my newfound home. Now I felt too lazy to return to what I\u2019d set out to\
  \ do: ride a bicycle from Portland, Maine to Key West, Florida. Nevertheless, there\
  \ I was in the parking lot, bike loaded and ready to go.\n\nIt was my intention\
  \ to ride 70 miles, the longest haul yet, figuring that two days of rest would have\
  \ served me well. Though I had been worried about flooding, there was none. Hurricane\
  \ Matthew had broken the seedy humidity, leaving a bright sun; cool dry breeze;\
  \ and textured blanket of pine cones, needles, and branches (sometimes trees) on\
  \ the road. The result was air that felt like autumn and vaguely smelled like Christmas.\
  \ Most of the ride was through the middle of nowhere. \n\n4 miles from the National\
  \ Forest I\u2019d be camping in, I was nearly halted by a road of wet clay. Driven\
  \ by the sheer proximity to my goal, I hauled myself through, pulled into the campground\
  \ entrance, and found this sign: \"Closed until Tuesday due to the hurricane.\"\
  \ I slumped to the ground in exhaustion. Though I could have opted for dispersed\
  \ camping, I was nearly out of water and would have been left with about 3 spoonfuls\
  \ of peanut butter for dinner.\n\nAnd so it goes that I biked 20 more miles to a\
  \ Kampgrounds Of America. All down highway 17, a 60 mph road I\u2019d come to avoid\
  \ at all costs. With a mile and a half to go, Matthew debris broke one of my spokes.\
  \ Hobbling into the KOA office at last, I broke open a bag of jalapeno Cheetos straight\
  \ off the shelf. The checkout girl assured me that even though four alligators lived\
  \ in the lake next to my site, they have only come out of the water once in 20 years.\
  \ I slept like a baby--92 miles down, alligators be damned."
