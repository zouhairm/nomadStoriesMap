Text: "The navy-blue car read \"carabinieri.\"  I felt the dark brown eyes of the\
  \ police force behind the glass barrier looking at me. My heart beat sped up and\
  \ I felt my throat tightening. I nervously started coughing, swallowing and clearing\
  \ my throat. It was like I was on a stage in front of an audience for a performance\
  \ that I didn't prepare for and I was wearing my granny panties and lunch lady bra.\
  \ I couldn't hide anything. I nervously started wringing my hands together. \n\n\
  We were in the middle of the action in Rome. The buzz of the city danced around\
  \ us while we were stopped. I looked past the partially rolled down window and started\
  \ blushing as my blue eyes connected with his eyes. I immediately looked down at\
  \ the ground as I realized I got caught. Oh gosh, is it appropriate to blush in\
  \ front of the police in a foreign country, I thought?  Well, either way, it was\
  \ happening. He sat in the passenger side with an eager smile. I felt relief wash\
  \ over my tingly hands because I knew he felt the same way even though I had no\
  \ idea what the conversation was about. The other police officer was speaking with\
  \ my friend who was fluent in Italian. We were near the famous Trevi fountain. Legend\
  \ says that if you throw in one coin it guarantees your return to Rome. Throw in\
  \ two for new romance and the three will ensure marriage...or wait, was it divorce?\
  \ I don't remember. I can't think straight. I feel like I got a freebie because\
  \ I didn't even throw any coins in yet and romance must have been stirred up from\
  \ the mist of the magical waters. Okay, snap out of it! These are the cops, there\
  \ is no goofing around. You don't live here, you are a guest. Act respectful.\n\n\
  My friend is finishing up her conversation with the Italian police officer and the\
  \ two of us attempt to communicate instead of just stare at each other awkwardly.\
  \ He speaks very little English and I speak no Italian. All of my language training\
  \ from the speakers in the bathroom of Carrabba's Italian Grill went out the window.\
  \ Somehow, we figure out that we both know enough conversational Spanish to remove\
  \ some of the barrier and communicate. He introduces himself as Telmo and points\
  \ to his chest. I smile and respond back that my name is Katie and then point to\
  \ myself. We still just smile stupidly as if we just accomplished something much\
  \ grander than we really did. We then muster up more momentum and found a way to\
  \ exchange email addresses. We are not going to jail today. I think I might have\
  \ a date though."
