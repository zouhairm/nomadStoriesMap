Text: "Tired and sweaty, I sat upon the ancient terrace to sip from my water bottle.\
  \  The hike had taken nearly two hours, 450 metres uphill from the Urubamba river\
  \ valley.  Angular mountains thrust up from the river valley below, sprouting independently\
  \ like candles on a birthday cake.  The underlying features softened by lush green\
  \ forests, so unlike the snow covered, alpine mountains at home.\n\nThe morning\
  \ sun crested, illuminating the sacred ruins below my resting place.  As dawn broke,\
  \ I was consumed by the magic of this place; sitting on a mountaintop, nestled amongst\
  \ the Andes, Machu Picchu glowing in front of me.  As though on cue, llamas began\
  \ to appear, grazing quietly nearby.  \n\nLast night as I sat on the patio at a\
  \ quiet street side caf\xE9, sipping Pisco Sours, I struck up a conversation with\
  \ a fellow traveler.  Mike, from Oklahoma, and I shared stories about traveling\
  \ alone and the quirks of Peruvian culture.  He had three simple rules for his time\
  \ alone; never make eye contact with anyone, do not stop to look at street side\
  \ handicrafts or restaurant members, and do not respond if a local speaks to you.\
  \  My own guidelines could not have been more opposite.  Simply; smile and share\
  \ laughter.  It is the differences that make travel so exciting.\n\nAfter an hour\
  \ or two of conversation, it was well after dark and Mike was participating in a\
  \ guided excursion to Machu Picchu the following day, and so bid me safe travels\
  \ and disappeared down the streets of Aguas Calientes.  A young boy, perhaps only\
  \ five years old kicked me the ball.  His mother smiled as we kicked it back and\
  \ forth.  She waved me over and despite my \u2018Donde es la biblioteca\u2019 level\
  \ of Spanish, we managed to share a few moments of laughter.  We spoke of our families\
  \ and the people I had met on my travels.\n\nThe rumble of engines roused me from\
  \ this meditation on the mystic mountaintop.  Tourists began arriving by the busload\
  \ and revolving through the turnstiles to Machu Picchu.  I smiled, grateful for\
  \ the secret hiking trail revealed after hours on a makeshift soccer pitch.   \n\
  \nA smile and some laughter had been enough to learn of a hiking path and an early\
  \ morning wake up, providing me the opportunity to experience the untouched beauty\
  \ of Machu Picchu.  I felt its power deep in my gut, understanding why the Incas\
  \ called it the Navel of the World.  I took one last long look before descending\
  \ from my perch into the ruins and brush against history, just one more globetrotting\
  \ gringo."
