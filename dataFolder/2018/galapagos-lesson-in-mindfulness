Text: "A female sea lion sleeps on the wooden plank snoozing in the equatorial sun.\
  \  Seemingly uninterested in the buzz of human activity going on around her. A crowd\
  \ of on-lookers watch this majestic creature offering each other puzzled looks,\
  \ as she\u2019s chosen her bed to be the middle of the boardwalk, and they need\
  \ a way past. These tourists are on their own plan, dictated and bound to illusions\
  \ of time, awaiting a ferry to return to Santa Cruz. A local man comes to the rescue\
  \ chasing the sea lion away.  She barks in protest and dives into the water with\
  \ a graceful swoop.  \n\nAfter having biked to the Wall of Tears and hiked to the\
  \ rim of the dormant Sierra Negraa volcano, no one thinks of extending their stay.\
  \ Instead thoughts drift to wondering what else these archipelago islands hold?\
  \  People board the dainty ferry boats with conversation on Isabella experiences\
  \ filling the air. The boat starts off and I enjoying the different islands appearing\
  \ then disappearing into the horizon. The hum of the engines becomes a background\
  \ noise, wind blows through my hair until suddenly we come to a stop.  \n\nThe captain\u2019\
  s shouting into the radio. We're told an engine has broken and we're to await rescue.\
  \  He goes back to the wheel steering the boat to combat the waves that knock the\
  \ boat around - like a cat playing with a jingly ball. \n\nThe first hour passes\
  \ - people start feeling seasickness. Why can\u2019t the waves stop?\nThe second\
  \ hour passes - people start wondering where is the rescue boat? Why can\u2019t\
  \ it come faster?\nThe third hour passes - the sun starts to set? Why can\u2019\
  t the sun not set until we are rescued?\n\nThe sun sets and the moon rises. As darkness\
  \ creeps in the water changes from sky blue to a dark shade of navy.  People keep\
  \ their eyes on the horizon waiting for the rescue boat.  Time passes slowly until\
  \ a boat shape is seen in the distance and smiles appear on faces. The captains\
  \ work together to outsmart waves and more the boats.  Everyone cheers, people\u2019\
  s hearts lighten, and relief sets in knowing the new boat has three engines.  \n\
  \nAfter everyone has transferred, the new boat takes off. People relax as the old\
  \ boat becomes a distant speck. I look up at the night sky and to my surprise I\
  \ see the milky way. The entire sky covered with the haziness of billions stars.\
  \ Horizon to horizon. I'm in awe. It\u2019s breathtaking. Magnificently indescribable.\
  \ The vastness of galaxies invoke feelings of humility.  The unforeseen experience\
  \ can lead to a beautiful moment in time."
