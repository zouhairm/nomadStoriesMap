Text: "Like a spaceman cut from his tether, I began to float away. But by releasing\
  \ the air in my lungs, I reversed the movement. Descending, my knees contacted the\
  \ submerged platform the more seasoned underwater enthusiasts were using to instruct\
  \ me and the other newbies in the art of scuba. Lesson 1: sit on this platform,\
  \ not the silty bottom\u2014unless you wish to surrender your new fins to the greedy\
  \ mud monsters below.\n\nI was floating again, rising through the tepid water towards\
  \ the surface. My shallow breathing was leaving too much air in my lungs, resulting\
  \ in a state of positive buoyancy rather than the neutral one divers need to avoid\
  \ yo-yoing up and down. Exhaling, I counteracted the unplanned ascent. Tentatively\
  \ secure on the wooden platform, I pulled a draught of oxygen. The vital gases moving\
  \ through my regulator hose restored my sense of equilibrium, and I began to relax.\n\
  \nBreathing (and buoyancy) under control, I recalled the decisions that lead me\
  \ here: the turbid waters of Trout Lake\u2014a flooded quarry in Innerkip, Ontario\
  \ (not exactly the pristine waters of the Riveria Maya, where I\u2019d made the\
  \ decision to give scuba diving a try).\n\nTwo years previous, I had travelled to\
  \ Mexico to marry the woman who was soon to be my ex-wife. Prior to the trip, I\
  \ had pushed for us to get scuba-certified. She pushed back: we went snorkelling\
  \ instead. It was fun; the soothing waters of the Dos Ojos cenote\u2014a freshwater\
  \ cavern\u2014imparted a tranquil ease on our whole group. Still, I harboured a\
  \ quiet envy of the cavern divers I spied beneath us through the windowpane-like\
  \ water.\n\nMauricio, our guide, was excellent. Funny and easy to talk to, he seemed\
  \ more like a friend we\u2019d all forgotten we had. \u201CHow long have you been\
  \ guiding?\u201D I asked him. \u201C6 years,\u201D he replied in smooth English\u2014\
  a relief, as \u2018me espa\xF1ol no es muy beuno\u2019 (my Spanish isn\u2019t very\
  \ good). I told him I wanted to try diving next time and asked if he did that, too.\
  \ \u201COh yes, diving is a lot of fun,\u201D he answered, \u201Cyou see a lot more.\u201D\
  \ My new, but temporary, spouse was smiling silently. I wondered if she had any\
  \ interest in going deeper.\n\nTwo years later, I was down a spouse but up a partner\u2014\
  a diver no less. She came along while me and the other rookies learned to breathe\
  \ under water, amused by our less-than-fish-like precision while kicking about the\
  \ silty water. \n\n\u201CIt\u2019s really great to have someone to dive with,\u201D\
  \ she said when we were back on the surface. \u201CI\u2019m glad it\u2019s something\
  \ we can do together,\u201D I replied."
