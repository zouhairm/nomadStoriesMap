Text: "\u201CEid Mubarak\u201D\n\nThe exclamation echoed through the humid Arabian\
  \ air as people emerged from their sun-worn villas. Today, the end of Ramadan (a\
  \ month long fast, obligatory for all adult muslims) was celebrated by eating. \n\
  Bin lids clanged as feral cats, with their uniquely shaped sharp faces and sleek\
  \ bodies, rummaged through the scraps from the first feast earlier this morning.\
  \ \n\nDespite being away for many years, I was in awe of this culture I had grown\
  \ up in. Nothing had changed. The dusty streets still held record of ancient stories,\
  \ mirrored in the time stained windows and cracking white-grey walls. \n\nIn jeans\
  \ and t-shirt, clutching my Nikon, I stood out distinctly. The local men were dressed\
  \ in their best - neatly ironed white dish dash (the robe worn by many Arabian men)\
  \ with gently wrapped cloth turban. \nThere was only one girl to compare myself\
  \ to. She was by far the youngest amongst a group of boys kicking a tired soccer\
  \ ball through the dirt. The boys wore the same as their fathers. She, on the other\
  \ hand, was dressed extravagantly. \nHer white dress - similar to a christening\
  \ gown - was embroidered elaborately with golden thread. Bangles rested gently on\
  \ the henna lining her hands and arms. A bright white ribbon sat carefully on her\
  \ head.\n\nEveryone was welcoming; sharing a greeting followed by the customary\
  \ handshake, nose rub and kiss. The familiarity of this connected us.  There was\
  \ no sense of distrust, but rather an embracing of me as part of the morning\u2019\
  s celebration.\n\nAs I turned to leave, there was a gentle tap on my elbow. The\
  \ surprise I felt must have been reflected on my face. She started speaking quickly\
  \ - filling the gap between our ages and cultures with words. \nDespite growing\
  \ up near here, my Arabic was no longer of serviceable standard and I had difficulty\
  \ understanding her. It was only when she pointed to my camera, made a clicking\
  \ motion and smiled that I understood.\nShe walked out a few feet ahead of me, turned\
  \ back and posed - like a pro. After a few shots, I lowered the camera and showed\
  \ her. She looked at the images, laughed happily, and then strutted away. She didn\u2019\
  t need any hard evidence to prove the shot or to remember the morning by. \n\nI\
  \ realised then, happiness and progress is not dependent on proving individual status\
  \ and attainment. Maybe a small town and a people can succeed and flourish - with\
  \ no tangible change - but simply through fortitude and heart."
