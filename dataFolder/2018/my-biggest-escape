Text: "The last thing I expected was to arrive in the Caribbean and learn a life lesson.\
  \ My biggest escape turned into my biggest blessing. As I watched, the people and\
  \ their way of life, I began to realize how grateful I should be.\n\nIn the car\
  \ ride into the city, I began to use my phone to capture the city of Santo Domingo.\
  \  I could not believe the scenery and how much the capital reminded me of the city\
  \ of New York. Lots of traffic, tall buildings everywhere and so many Billboards.\
  \ As we started to arrive to my destination, I could see more homes with a rustic\
  \ and run down look, people walking down the street and coming off the bus, or what\
  \ looked like taxicabs. The glamour had died down but the vibe was good.  There\
  \ were people all around me laughing, having conversations, and dancing in the streets.\
  \ It was an amazing site to see. I continued to walk to the place I would be living\
  \ for the next 30 days. \n\nIn those 30 days, I began to self-reflect and enjoy\
  \ the life with the people of Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. The Dominicans\
  \ were full of life. The first night I remembered the electricity going off at 8\
  \ pm. I did not know what to do. My cousin opened the blinds so that we can feel\
  \ the night air and asked me if I wanted to go on the roof. I soon found myself\
  \ surrounded with people fellowship among themselves with music and food. This dilemma\
  \ open up an opportunity for the people to come together and enjoy themselves. There\
  \ was no complaints but pure joy and life. Everyone was familiar with each other\
  \ except for me. I was the new face in the room and they could tell that I was foreign.\
  \ With my dreaded loc's, and pretty dress. The people open my eyes to a new life\
  \ and positive perspective.  They found themselves among each other trying to live\
  \ life because they did not have a lot but their spirit was great. \n\nThe next\
  \ day my cousin took me to the Boca Chica. The first thing I noticed about the beach\
  \ was the clear blue waters. As the sun hit the ocean water, you could see the deep\
  \ blue see and all its clarity. It was paradise and I could not believe I was here.\
  \ Something about the ocean feels so serine and just for a moment, you forget about\
  \ all of life problems. As I looked around me, I found myself noticing different\
  \ faces and shades of people. The human race is one race and we all desire the same\
  \ things.  To live a good life, love, and be successful. I learned life is not about\
  \ the things, but about perspective. You can live a rich life and have nothing."
