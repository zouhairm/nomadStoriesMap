Text: "Nowadays, we are together in the available technologies making connections\
  \ all the time, today, is an indispensable tool for such an action. Be it through\
  \ interactions in social networks or applications such as google maps that we can\
  \ share our current location with some friends. These connections bring us closer\
  \ to places we've never stepped on, I, for example, usually use google Earth to\
  \ create searches and explore places I want to know yet not available the opportunity\
  \ to go.\nHowever, for places to explore, there is no need to go far. In my own\
  \ town, there are places to be explored, whether they are in the midst of nature\
  \ or not in the downtown, you just need an adventurous spirit or be curious. In\
  \ the city where I live (Ponta Grossa, Paran\xE1 - Brazil) is the ideal place to\
  \ live adventures, for example, there\u2019s a place called Buraco do Padre, which\
  \ is a cave and in its interior a waterfall 30 meters high, is a wonderful place\
  \ to visit. Returning to talk about connections, I was surprised with a photo of\
  \ Burraco do Padre, one of the natural symbols of the region where I live, has been\
  \ published on the brazilian edition of National Geographic  page in Facebook, and\
  \ as well as the connections, several others travel blogs shared information, photos\
  \ and videos, presenting this incredible place to various types of audiences and\
  \ people involved from various places in Brazil.\nThe connection issue is to transcribe\
  \ to the people and show that this little corner in the world exists and can be\
  \ served, I want, also, to show the connection that this place has like people that\
  \ live in that region, its culture and its way of life. I, for example, am passionate\
  \ about gourmet coffees and bars, I have already done a tour guide of them in my\
  \ city, to visit all this places, a goal is always visit some new point and that\
  \ is not yet known. I love to admire their interior decorations, their details,\
  \ the way to receive us and write our requests in little notebooks or in are direct\
  \ system by tablet or cell phone and the types of food that they offer. Just like\
  \ me, some friends do the same thing - they list the places - and we share our experience\
  \ with one another that has as to know the new bar or coffee that we were, and thus\
  \ we created a connection a beter web between us, besides of course, every encounter\
  \ with as friends be in a different place. So, we can experience adventures without\
  \ leaving our region, just look around us and be open to new experiences."
