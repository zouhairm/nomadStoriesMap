Text: "It was the first time when I leave my province, one of southernmost island\
  \ in Indonesia. I independently went to Jakarta, the capital city of Indonesia,\
  \ to go to one of the islands in Natuna, Batu Berian. I traveled to Natuna and had\
  \ a real sense of adventure because I devote to educate Indonesia\u2019s children\
  \ for a year. Using an aircraft, I hit the road to Jakarta, staying one night and\
  \ fly to Batam. I stayed one night again in Batam then I would fly to Ranai the\
  \ next day, capital city of Natuna. To go to Batu Berian island, I sailed about\
  \ 17 hours in Serasan then I sailed with pompong (small boat) about 1 hour. The\
  \ traveling is not spending a day, two days or three days, but it almost a week\
  \ with the poor weather. I am always dreaming of my next far-off, exotic destination.\n\
  I finally decide to leave my job and freely travel to an isolated area because I\
  \ love traveling in the middle of nowhere, and I want the traveling is useful for\
  \ everyone with my devotion to education. Due to a different culture in Natuna,\
  \ I studied local culture and local language. I also realize that Indonesia has\
  \ much cultures and languages which cannot be counted.\nMoreover, I do love a beach\
  \ and I stayed at inhabitant\u2019s home about a year. The home is behind of the\
  \ beach so I can enjoy the jaw-dropping landscape every second such as sunset and\
  \ sunrise. I am a little nervous about seasickness so I overcame it with a voyage\
  \ to distinct islands. I do love the idea of island-hopping. Sailing around the\
  \ sea is like a natural aquarium as there are some Nemo and Dory fishes. The water\
  \ is like a tear of the angel because of purification. Furthermore, I always scheduled\
  \ for fishing in the sea. That is another one of my bucket list of destinations.\
  \ After I threw my angler, I always get a fish on it in a second. This has proven\
  \ that Natuna Sea is rich with fishes. As a science teacher, I always teach my student\
  \ to watch a natural wealth of Natuna such as fishes, seaweeds, and others. I also\
  \ teach them how to take some function that others cannot take it such as making\
  \ a crispy or stick and how to sell it in a different area. Those kinds of places\
  \ give you such a better perspective on life. It is easy to forget we are all just\
  \ a tiny piece of this earth."
