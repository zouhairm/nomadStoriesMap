Text: "So, I had always a mind that yearned to travel, and never stop at that. That\
  \ dream never really became a reality, although I was married I had nobody to go\
  \ out until I decided enough is enough. I started searching ways, and very soon\
  \ traveling was no longer my dream because I started living it; I must attribute\
  \ to the technology that helped me unify with the wanderlusts. \nIt was a day before\
  \ the Christmas eve in 2017 when my friends and I reached Hampi, an ancient town\
  \ that is a good seven hours drive from Bangalore. We spent the first and the second\
  \ day sightseeing the vestiges of a fallen empire. On the eve of Christmas, our\
  \ campsite owner gave us a surprise,a surprise that the music enthusiast in me will\
  \ always remember: a beautiful jamming session with the local musician Gali Durugappa\
  \ and his bunch of European backpacker musicians. It was late into the night but\
  \ the bonfire kept us all warm. Gali has two kids, his son supports him with drums\
  \ while his daughter just sat beside me. She was unfamiliar with the campsite so\
  \ I doubled up as her escort while Gali kept the musical ambiance alive. \nWe then\
  \ broke for a quick dinner. I was very glad to strike a conversation with Gali and\
  \ his backpackers. It was then I got to understand more about Gali. He runs a small\
  \ shop of musical instruments, he said in broken English. I realized I have met\
  \ someone who can play a dozen instruments ranging from African djembe, guitar,\
  \ cymbal to Australia's didgeridoo and Polish saxophone. I was told his shop is\
  \ sort of a melting pot of musical instruments, fewer artistically-inclined people,\
  \ jamming sessions and free music healing classes. \nWe saw his son is a great Djembe\
  \ drummer. I asked if his daughter played any instrument. It was a negative. I made\
  \ Gali promise that he would also groom his daughter to learn the instruments. It\
  \ was then I decided I may need to visit Hampi one more time only to see her perform.\
  \ How much I love such moments of love and promises! \nI later connected with Gali\
  \ on Facebook. I came to know from his posts that the government here, in partnership\
  \ with UNESCO, plans to demolish the colorful shops of Hampi Bazaar, his included.\
  \ Gali's shop may soon pass into the realms of memory forever. Although I was unable\
  \ to swing by his shop while in Hampi, I have a promise to keep: visit Hampi once\
  \ again, and see his daughter perform adeptly like her father before an audience.\n\
  Good news: Crowdfunding is initiated for Gali's community music center. Happy Hampi!"
