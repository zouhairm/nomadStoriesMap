Text: "A hot, humid breeze gently grazed my sunkissed cheeks. I can remember it so\
  \ vividly; the bright sun that day had reflected off of my sunglasses in such a\
  \ way that I was forced to remove them. It wasn't something to complain about, as\
  \ the sight in front of me was oh so breathtaking. A wonder to truly behold. The\
  \ Nohoch Mul Pyramid in Coba, in the Yucat\xE1n Peninsula of Quintana Roo. An ancient\
  \ and spiritual structure built by the hands of devout worshipers.\nThe time was\
  \ 6:30 A.M. There were some locals and a handful of tourists from the bus that had\
  \ transported us. Watching them begin their climb; I suddenly became hesitant. Never\
  \ having accomplished anything, doubt froze my body. \"Am I strong enough to make\
  \ it to the top?\" The words reverberated around me. A hand gently caressed my shoulder.\
  \ An elderly man with beautifully tanned skin and vivid brown eyes looked up at\
  \ me. His high socks and loafers had made me chuckle inside. \n\"Estas nervioso?\"\
  \ \U0001D620\U0001D630\U0001D636 \U0001D622\U0001D633\U0001D626 \U0001D62F\U0001D626\
  \U0001D633\U0001D637\U0001D630\U0001D636\U0001D634? He asked, a hesitant smile appearing\
  \ on his cracked lips. I nodded with shame. It seemed so simple; to climb a 'great\
  \ mound'. Yet it was unnerving. It laid out like a puzzle, designed thousands of\
  \ years ago simply for us to overcome what we are most frightened of; ourselves.\
  \ The man pulled away from me and shoved his hand into a shoulder bag that hung\
  \ diligently beside him. He reached out with an old, faded photograph. He gently\
  \ laid it in my hands and his breathing began to shake. The edges were torn and\
  \ had visibly browned over time, but on the image was the same stony temple we currently\
  \ stood in front of. At the base was a young Hispanic male with a smile on his face\
  \ that stretched from ear to ear.\n \"Mi Padre.\" The elderly man pointed at the\
  \ photo and then at himself, tears welling up in his eyes. Even though neither of\
  \ us could really understand the other, I knew what he meant. That he was where\
  \ I am now but following the distant footsteps of his father. That he knew the hesitation\
  \ I felt. A weight lifted off my shoulders as I stared down at the picture. It was\
  \ a lesson, told through the hands of a stranger. Even though we may not truly believe\
  \ in ourselves, there is no task we cannot fulfill. Nothing that we can't do, if\
  \ we just set our minds to it.\nWe ascended the stairs together. The terror of failing\
  \ was heavy on my mind but I considered my new friend beside me. It was his unshakable\
  \ hope in someone he had never known, that helped both of us reach the top.\nAnd\
  \ what a view it was."
