Text: "It was always my wish to draw a desert\u2019s sketch in my drawing-book during\
  \ my childhood days; desert used to be a wonderland for me, as I belong to central\
  \ part of the India, so never got any chance to envision how desert looks like.\
  \ The only thing I could hallucinate about desert was yellowish, golden, glittery\
  \ landscape enveloped with sand, surrounded by camel and cactus, but fortunately\
  \ these were not the only features you find in the desert, it has enormous secrets\
  \ to unleash. The hunt of infancy illusion to draw a perfect desert portrait took\
  \ me to THAR, the Great Indian Desert. I really wanted to perceive a real sandy\
  \ desert which I used to mesmerize, the journey was quite exiting; the paths seemed\
  \ to blend naturally into the barren landscapes, grime and caravan of camels in\
  \ a sandy Island. As I always wanted to do a camel ride, so I choose Camel safari;\
  \ my camel was so endearing and decorated with lots of bright cloths & ornaments.\
  \ It was so patiently quiet and arid; the loudest sound I could hear was the grunting\
  \ of my camel. It was so massive and endless but it was also gentle, composed and\
  \ courteous; despite being uninhabited, it nurtures lives, shelters wild animals\
  \ and plants; though it has nothing to cultivate but it cherishes whoever comes\
  \ in to its asylum. Its loneliness is its uniqueness, it has its own barren beauty,\
  \ it always encourages for the \u2018survival of fittest\u2019 in most awful situation,\
  \ and its really a great teacher. After a few hours of riding I stopped, the place\
  \ was quite palliative and relaxing, surrounded by cactus shrub, some rare birds\
  \ and a herd of sheep and goats.its is extremely dramatic abode; nothing is motionless,\
  \ especially its Dunes; it change very frequently, builds and disappears so quickly\
  \ along with the wind-gales, so never set any dune as your landmark, you could be\
  \ lost. Again, these fickle dunes preach the realism of the life that \u2018nothing\
  \ is constant except change\u2019, it seemed like carving on golden wood, and untouched\
  \ by footsteps. After this I headed towards the sunset point, the sun was quickly\
  \ disappearing from the sky; the sand started glowing gold; it was like a ritual\
  \ for us, as everyone was so quiet and curious to witness the best show if the desert.\
  \ The red ball of fire was getting settled down below the horizon, what a sunset\
  \ it was. It was a marvelous feeling. \nThar will always remain close to my heart,\n\
  \"its an amphitheater of the human life, and name of the show is \u2018stay alive\
  \ in the lonely sphere\u2019..\""
