Text: "Making connection is paramount. Palpable. An intention I set each and every\
  \ morning, without fail. Because after thirty six years fumbling, stumbling and\
  \ ambling around this crazy planet, I've realized it is my driving force. A handshake,\
  \ a hug, a smile, eyes-met at random, passing another on the street. The tangible\
  \ elements that strip down class and barrier to who we are intrinsically. Human.\
  \ Energies. Co-habitating, sometimes with grace, often in confusion, and if we're\
  \ lucky, with humor.\n\nFor fifteen years, alcohol held a tight grip on my soul.\
  \ On my reality. On my perception of the world. A best friend, a confidant, a non-judgmental\
  \ partner in crime, it consumed me and I it until oblivion would descend, erasing\
  \ all memories. And then it turned on me. A once blissful relationship now felt\
  \ cold. Shaky mornings rife with worry, extremities cold, terror permeating me to\
  \ the core. My solace became my ultimate tormentor.\n\nTo say waking up in the hospital\
  \ was a gift would lack gravity. A second chance at life, a gust of breath in my\
  \ lungs as they pulled the intubation tubes out of my throat. I\u2019m here world.\
  \ I\u2019m alive. Will you still have me?\n\nBaby steps. Re-learning how to live.\
  \ To exist as a human. A once dormant spirit began to re-ignite. Very slowly at\
  \ first, but then with a gusto and a fervor I\u2019d never experienced. Wild-eyed\
  \ wonder, childlike glee, a curiosity unstoppable. I began to wander. To explore.\
  \ To travel. \n\nPortland. San Francisco. NYC. Seattle. Kansas City. Mexico. Chicago.\
  \ Unsure of my footing and terrified, I dove into the fray. I needed to feel. Even\
  \ if it was fear. \n\nConnection while meandering this planet is nothing short of\
  \ astonishing. Seemingly small exchanges are rife with texture and tone. Curiosities\
  \ met with engaged eyes and hearts when not sloughed off as inconsequential. The\
  \ baby glimpses, the sideways glances, the giggle fits out of nowhere, sparking\
  \ joy in the hearts of the human to your left. We are all connected. Interwoven\
  \ energies, in both mind and spirit. But do we dare admit it? Do we venture to allow\
  \ such a tether to infiltrate the barrier? Vulnerabilities faced, hearts opened,\
  \ guards shattered. That is where the the truth exists if we are willing to look\
  \ for it."
