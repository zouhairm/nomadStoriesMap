Text: "It was an extremely hot afternoon in the warm Moroccan Summer. It was our fourth\
  \ day in Morocco and after staying two days in Zagora desert sleeping in a jaima,\
  \ we thought we were ready to endure twelve hours on the bus from Marrakech to Fez.\n\
  \nWhen we arrived at the bus station, we discovered how strange the Moroccan bus\
  \ stations are, at least for us. As soon as we entered, two men began to chase us\
  \ running and asking us where we were going and where we were from... The station\
  \ was like an anthill; full of people going from one place to another, some carrying\
  \ huge packages.\n\nOne of the men stopped following us, to chase another traveler\
  \ who had just entered the station and the other man guided us to the ticket office.\
  \ As we approached the window where tickets are sold, we could not see anybody and\
  \ we think that maybe he would be in the prayer room where some men were praying\
  \ on a carpet ... but our \"new guide man\" pointed to the floor and there was the\
  \ man lying on his mat, his arms flexed and his hands under his head ... When we\
  \ asked for tickets to Fez, he just shook his head and answered us _Today begins\
  \ Ramadan, the only bus to Fez is midnight bus.\n\nAfter some hours waiting in that\
  \ station, a man advertised us that the bus had already arrived and we went out\
  \ with our backpacks. It was suffocating heat and the sidewalk was full of people\
  \ and giant packages wrapped in white fabric ... I did not think they were able\
  \ to put all those packages in a single bus.\n A girl in her eleven or twelve years\
  \ approached us and asked us where we were from, I had not realized but we were\
  \ the only foreign women there. while I was speaking with her, a young man arrived\
  \ and asked us how much they had charged us for the tickets, He thought that maybe\
  \ they had scammed us and was surprised that they had charged us the right thing.\n\
  \nWhen everyone was already inside, the driver asked us to pay him a deposit for\
  \ carrying our backpacks in the luggage compartment and we got a little angry because\
  \ we thought he was trying to cheat us... then we learned that this is normal, not\
  \ a scam.\nHe walked leading us along the bus and drove out a guy who was traveling\
  \ alone, so we could go together. That was very unpleasant, but the driver was the\
  \ one who gave orders there and we all accepted.\n\nIt looked the worst begin for\
  \ our road trip, but not always a bad start has to end badly. That bus was full\
  \ of stories, new friends, and many mysteries. It was the most adventurous trip\
  \ I have ever had!"
