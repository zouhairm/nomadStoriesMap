Text: "\u201CWhere are you from?\u201D she asks me.\nI met her on my last day in Israel,\
  \ a trip that I was so scared to take. Living in a post-communist country, where\
  \ the sad past circumstances have annihilated people\u2019s freedom and adventure\
  \ thirst, I was probably entitled to be. \u201CWhy that far away?\u201D or \u201C\
  Isn\u2019t it dangerous there?\u201D are a few questions I would have been asked\
  \ if I had expressed my travel ideas. That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t choose to. Something\
  \ in the back on my mind was shouting at me that I should take the trip, regardless\
  \ of the fear.\nDuring my 10 days in Israel I met some wonderful fellow travelers,\
  \ tasted delicious  soul-feeding dishes, inhaled beautiful traditional art, drove\
  \ through the amazing rocky desert until I got to the most beautiful sea I\u2019\
  ve ever seen, filled with colorful water creatures; I\u2019ve visited amazing national\
  \ parks and took the most fulfilling sunrise hike by the Dead Sea - which felt even\
  \ better to float in after contemplating it from up above - and I just couldn\u2019\
  t believe my eyes. Being there, I was experiencing an antithetical feeling to what\
  \ I had expected before buying the ticket - or maybe I did foresee something beautiful\
  \ when I bought them.\n\u201CRomania\u201D I reply, and I can see her eyes filling\
  \ with light.\nThe woman owns a jewelry shop in the heart of the old town of Jerusalem,\
  \ which is the last to visit on my trip. Her voice sounds like she would love to\
  \ share more of her life with other people, if only we weren\u2019t so busy, and\
  \ I am so delighted to listen to her stories. I am in love with Israel, I could\
  \ never compare it to my home country \u2013 I thought - and seeing her enthusiasm\
  \ when disclosing its name intrigues me.\n \u201CYou have such a beautiful homeland!\u201D\
  \ she shouts. \u201CAstonishing forests, landscapes. Oh, you\u2019re so lucky!\u201D\
  \ she explains.\nAt first I was confused, but soon I understood it all: the beauty\
  \ that surrounds us everywhere, that\u2019s right next to us and we fail to even\
  \ notice it, the happiness that we are just so time-poor to feel. This kind of love,\
  \ it was all there, always within me.\nShe set me free from my fears, and I finally\
  \ learned the reason I went to Israel for - to let go of the worry and to be able\
  \ to embrace all the beauty that surrounds me on this Planet, at home or far away.\n\
  I hug her and while I find my way out, I notice the look on her face \u2013 she\
  \ understands. I nod and say \u201CThank you!\u201D"
