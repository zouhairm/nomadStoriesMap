Text: "If you don't know TIA (This is Africa), it is common amongst African travelers\
  \ and used to represent everything that can and will go on, and WOW did I live that\
  \ yesterday. Every notion I had about personal space, hygiene, and  every other\
  \ common western value was totally and violently ripped from me. To explain, let's\
  \ jump into the Mr. Peabody wayback machine and I'll share my day.\n\n9:45am Dar\
  \ Es Salaam, Tanzania Unbungu station: Chaos is too mild to explain the sight of\
  \ men literally knocking each other over to get to the foreigner to help him out\
  \ of his money as I strove to find the right bus to Arusha begin my first African\
  \ safari. I was trying to find the two bus lines I was told only to take.  But was\
  \ told by some \"helpers\" neither were running today. Finally getting to the booking\
  \ office with the \"helpers\" only proves to find collusion and I'm shuffled to\
  \ another bus.\n\n10:30am-Certain I was taken, I don't have a schedule to prove\
  \ anything else. I question the driver: \"this is an express bus? Yes\"-LIE#1, \"\
  This is a luxury bus? Yes\"-LIE#2, \"What time does it leave? 10:45\"- LIE#3, \"\
  How long does it take? 8 hours\"-LIE#4-and the biggest!\n\n11:45am-Things get fun!\
  \ The so called 8 hour trip becomes 13, the seat of the bus has NO padding. I am\
  \ 6'0, 220, there are two men next to me my size. Roughly every 25 minutes we make\
  \ a stop. Express my ASS! The best part is the variety of cargo, car fenders, bushels\
  \ of fruit, computer monitors, and my favorite, chickens, right at my feet!  Through\
  \ it all, adding to the elbow wedged in my ribs, my seatmate decided he wants to\
  \ use me as a pillow. I have no fight left, let it go.  But let\u2019s not forget\
  \ the constant butt on my head, breast to my chin, crotch in my face and squashed\
  \ toe as riders stand on top of me 30 minutes prior to their stop. I even had one\
  \ large set buttocks wedged on my ear and, for the piece de resistance, vibrated\
  \ heartily with a gaseous explosion, yes, put the picture together, RIGHT ON MY\
  \ HEAD! TIA!\n\nBy the time I rolled into the Ngorongoro crater camp, I was wired\
  \ and tired, stressed and relieved all in one. This ride had me laughing at the\
  \ absurdity of how much I take for granted at home. It had me on the verge of tears\
  \ with frustration and isolation. It had me enjoying a culture dipolar from my own.\
  \ In short it was an experience that pushed me not to the edge but right outside\
  \ the envelope. I can't say I want to do it again, but having done it once I can\
  \ move on in my life with a larger envelope."
