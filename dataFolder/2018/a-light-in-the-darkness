Text: "We had to reach there by 3 in the morning, so I couldn\u2019t sleep at all.\
  \ At 2 AM, I showered and draped myself in a sari. It was a beautiful, dark and\
  \ chilly morning. The number of souls wandering on streets waiting for the doors\
  \ to open completely contradicted the rules of human life cycle, the nap time. Shiva,\
  \ with all his innocence, truly had the love of his devotees.\n\nI was at the only\
  \ temple in India where they have a ritual called \u201CBhasmarti\u201D, meaning\
  \ worship with ashes. Shiva, who is always worshiped in the form of lingams, resided\
  \ in the ancient city of Ujjain as \u201CMahakal\u201D, one of his most powerful\
  \ manifestations.\n\nHaving my inclination more towards atheism, the only reason\
  \ I was there was for the once in a lifetime experience as recommended by many Hindus.\n\
  \nMy surrounding air was overpowered by the fragrance of fresh flowers, camphor,\
  \ incense, and the sounds of chants and praises. The excitement that other devotees\
  \ expressed with their patience and faith compelled me to become a part of their\
  \ anticipation too. \n\nBeliever or not, you cannot force yourself into a feeling\
  \ like this one. The ambiance itself started to unify me in and it now came to me\
  \ naturally, I was at peace.\n\nThe doors opened and Shiva finally appeared to address\
  \ his people. There were around ten priests present in his service. \n\nThe rituals\
  \ began with the offerings of water, milk, sugar, ghee, honey, curd, flowers and\
  \ bhang. Shiva was then groomed, painted with stupefying eyes and a crescent moon\
  \ on his head. A monk accompanied by four hounds bought the customary ashes from\
  \ a cremation ground. The Shiva lingam was dusted with ashes and everyone surrendered\
  \ to silence, only the bells chimed and the priests voiced.\n\nComing close to the\
  \ final prayer, they turned off the lights and let the shrine gleam in the natural\
  \ glow of fire lamps. In that moment, I witnessed a light in the darkness. One was\
  \ before my eyes, other was within me. The radiance on Shiva\u2019s face felt as\
  \ if he came to life.\n\nThe music of chants, drums, bells and hand cymbals blended\
  \ like it was God\u2019s own personal rock concert and I found myself matching the\
  \ beats with claps along with hundreds of others. Isn\u2019t it amazing how hundreds\
  \ of strangers can become one with a tiny bond of faith?\n\nThe impact of everything\
  \ that was happening was enough to engage all my senses and relayed a ton of energy\
  \ that directly reached my soul. I never expected to have restored my faith. An\
  \ almost atheist returned home as an almost believer."
