Text: "One of the greatest truths I was taught in my teenage years, was that it is\
  \ in the smallest, unexpected moments where we truly discover something we didn't\
  \ know we were searching. To let the adventure guide us to places we'd never been\
  \ to before or to try things we'd tell ourselves a million times over in our heads\
  \ that we'd never give a try.\n\nI could never have imagined that in this strange,\
  \ yet somewhat familiar foreign country that these words would ring so true. Not\
  \ in the centuries-old cobblestones in the path that drew and pulled me along its\
  \ way. As if calling me to get lost and wander down its seemingly endless trail.\
  \ Along the way, the greenery seemed to reach out towards me. \n\nContinuing what\
  \ was seeming to become longer and longer, I stopped briefly at this aging polished\
  \ white table, that seemed like it had jumped out of an England landscaping magazine,\
  \ that I had come across in one of my many stays in hostels. It stuck out to me\
  \ with it's fading paint and intricate designs. Something that seemed so different\
  \ from the lush nature and the old cobblestones. It reminded me of the posts on\
  \ Instagram from the inspiring traveling teenagers that I sought so much to be like\
  \ at that age.\n\nNow with a diploma and a full future ahead of me, I push past\
  \ the table, letting the stones guide me to place I didn't know that I needed to\
  \ explore.\n\nThe silence was tranquil, seeming impossible for such a lively place\
  \ to fill with the only occasional chirping of birds laying low in the tree branches.\
  \ Finally, at the end, the stones stop abruptly at a petite building, shy looking\
  \ but seemingly welcoming aura from its roots that seem to crawl up from the ground,\
  \ along with the cream white exterior like grape vines on a gable. I peer into the\
  \ window, which to my amazement, was filled with little desserts.\n\nWith a curious\
  \ mind, I slowly pull on the door. Chimes sing out through the shop. Surprised by\
  \ the noise, a girl turns her head, a warm smile forms when she catches my eyes.\
  \ In my limited knowledge of the language, I great her with a smile and a \"good\
  \ afternoon.\"\n\nShe reply's with an even warmer smile, and it's in this moment\
  \ I realize the sincerity and value of travel. All the individuals you will meet\
  \ on your travels, the kindness you will experience and return. The experiences\
  \ you will live through. In this small shop, hidden down an old cobblestone path,\
  \ that seemed to appear, that wasn't even a planned stop became one of my highlights\
  \ for years to come."
