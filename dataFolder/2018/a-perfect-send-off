Text: "Pulling away from the quaint, painted streets of Antigua, I wondered why I\
  \ had agreed to spend my day off in an over-stuffed retired school bus. We had bought\
  \ a last minute ticket to Sacatepequez, and I had insisted on sitting on the side\
  \ I thought would have the best view. But it was crowded now, and as the late morning\
  \ sun baked through glass, I felt my cheeks reddening and instantly regretted my\
  \ decision. \n\nI groaned a little and readjusted in my seat, my mind trailing back\
  \ to old memories on the sludging Weston Supermare beach, trying to get my pink\
  \ and yellow kite to catch a gust of wind. \u201CSacatepequez has the best kites\u201D\
  \ someone was exclaiming, but I had never liked kites.\n\nAs we rounded the hill\
  \ and came to a stop, I jumped down the bus steps. My landing created a mushroom\
  \ cloud of dust at my feet, and I rubbed my eyes as they adjusted to the light.\
  \ There was a surge from the crowd, heckling store owners, and a loudness that only\
  \ comes with festivities. Above me birds were casting flickering shadows, but I\
  \ was engulfed in my task of blindly following familiar faces through the crowd.\
  \  \n\nAlex yelled something undistinguishable at me, glancing upward. I followed\
  \ his gaze; these weren\u2019t birds, but spiralling kites that danced in the fickle\
  \ winds. Candy-licked, with a distinctive roundness, and detailed Aztec designs,\
  \ these didn\u2019t resemble the kites from my distant memories on that cold beach.\
  \ Their mesmerizing colours were eclipsed only by the awe of their sheer size. As\
  \ the kites dipped uneasily low, young children cackled and splintered off in different\
  \ directions. Grappling for steady ground, I realised we were in the middle of a\
  \ sprawling graveyard. \n\nMy experiences of death were limited. I had never been\
  \ to a funeral, or visited someones gravestone. How to honour someone passing was\
  \ still in itself, foreign to me. That day I learnt how together each year, the\
  \ communities in Sacatepequez diligently create these flying mosaics, spanning the\
  \ lengths of rural houses. They trek up the mountains to the gravestones of loved\
  \ ones, and lay blossoming flowers. Then they gather around to launch these magnificent\
  \ kaleidoscope kites, releasing them into the skies. \n\nAn homage to the fleeting\
  \ spirits of those passed, and a bonding for those who remain. Breathing in the\
  \ crisp air of the bustling hills, and watching the vivid tapestries spiral higher\
  \ above me, I couldn\u2019t imagine a better way."
