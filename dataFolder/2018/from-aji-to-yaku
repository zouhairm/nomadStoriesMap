Text: "Peru is best known for its cuisine. And what better way to find out about the\
  \ local culture than getting to know, in the tastier way, the food. With a variety\
  \ of influences from the European and Asian culture that can be seen in the plate\
  \ with the home country ingredients, which they are most proud of. However, each\
  \ and every region of Peru adds their own flavor to the food. From the entrance\
  \ plate to the dessert, you will find the specifics of each region. \n\nThe country\
  \ is divided in three regions, but with something in common, the entire coast can\
  \ print the same flavors in the plate. \"Ceviche\" is something you could have anywhere\
  \ in the country, although they will tell you that the fish from the pacific coast\
  \ tastes best. And they are not lying. \"Aj\xED\" will add the spiciness to the\
  \ food, and they usually have that during lunch with everything, from \"Chicharr\xF3\
  n\" to \"Lomo Saltado\". However, if you do not like spicy food, they do give you\
  \ the option of adding \"aj\xED\" or not. \n\nChifa means the combination of the\
  \ Chinese and Peruvian cuisine, and it is, probably, the biggest influence of a\
  \ foreigner country in the Peruvian food. Loved by locals and foreigners, Chifa\
  \ gives you an immense variety of options, with lots of carbs and protein, just\
  \ what you expect for the lowest price, and a huge amount of food and flavors. From\
  \ \"Arroz Chaufa\" (fried rice with soy sauce, scallions, fried egg, and meat such\
  \ as chicken or pork) to \"Tallarin Saltado\" (pasta with sirloin strips with onions,\
  \ tomatoes, peppers and meat). \n\nIn general, the Peruvian food is not expensive,\
  \ compared to other countries in South America. Being that the Menu (one entrance,\
  \ one main course and a juice) is the most common option of a lunch you will find.\
  \ The entrance tends to be a soup, like \"yaku\" or \"sopa verde\". And \"chicha\"\
  \ is the best juice you will try, initially made by the native from the juice that\
  \ came out of the corn while it was being cooked. \n\nKeep in mind that, during\
  \ most part of the year, in Lima, the capital, is really cold and people enjoy hot/spicy\
  \ food. Not forgetting alcoholic beverages, since they also keep you warm and helps\
  \ with your digestion during the cold weather or a heavy food. \n\nBeing Brazilian,\
  \ everyone has heard of the \"Caipirinha\", but when you are in Peru, you must try\
  \ \"Pisco Sour\", which is the equivalent in famous local beverages. It is made\
  \ from grapes, and you can also visit local farms that produce the Pisco, either\
  \ industrial or manually, and it is totally worthy the trip."
