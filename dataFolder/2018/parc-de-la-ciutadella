Text: "I left it for the end. I was tired but people had told me \u2013 \u201Dyou\
  \ have to see it\u201D - so I hadn\u2019t got a choice. The whole day of walking,\
  \ looking for places, moving grey cells to decide where the west and where the east\
  \ is\u2026 \u201DI\u2019m going to see it and come back home with clear conscience\u201D\
  , I told myself in thoughts. I stood in front of the gate, made few steps forward\
  \ and crossed the entrence of the Parc de la Ciutadella.\nThe first thing I heard\
  \ was drums \u2013 deep steady sounds of djembe. I looked around to find a source\
  \ of the music. On a path in front of me was sitting a guy holding a big drum. In\
  \ the same moment I noticed him, he started singing and corners of my mouth raised\
  \ slightly.\nI put a coin to his cup and looked round one more time. The drummer\
  \ wasn\u2019t the only busker on the path \u2013 they were interwined with trees\
  \ on both sides of the road. Behind their backs I saw grassy hills on the left and\
  \ big brick buildings surrounded by wild plants on the right. Edifices were hidden\
  \ in the jungle of palms and I almost heard monkey\u2019s laught coming from this\
  \ thicket. I reached into my belly bag for a phone to make a picture of this uncommon\
  \ place but someone stopped me by touching my arm. It was an elder man with walking\
  \ cane.\n- !Bella, no feu fotos, nom\xE9s mira i experimenta!\n- Yo hablo espa\xF1\
  ol un poco \u2013 I tried to explain to him since I didn\u2019t understand what\
  \ he was saying. But my words didn\u2019t go to him. He was still waving his arms\
  \ as if he wanted to show me something.\nSo I followed his hand with my eyes and\
  \ looked at green areas of grass on my left. I looked at families making picnics,\
  \ youngsters doing yoga, boys trying to sell colorful shawls, artists enchanting\
  \ passers by their magic tricks\u2026 and I got it. I got the sense of the old man\u2019\
  s words. I got the local connection. The connection with strange and normal, different\
  \ and the same, colorful, open, catalan people.\n- Gracias! - I called to the man,\
  \ closed my bag and move ahead to discover the beauty of the park.\nI met ducks\
  \ on my way. I met boats with lovers. I met an almost real mammoth, the Gaudi\u2019\
  s fountaine, monumental sculptures and soap bubbles. I met people again \u2013 dancing\
  \ at the stage in June\u2019s sun. And I joined them! I was dancing flamenco although\
  \ I didn\u2019t know how.\nSometimes you unnoticeably drop the barriers and don\u2019\
  t defend yourself from being free. This feeling comes without any warning. Just\
  \ comes. At home, among friends, in a plane or maybe in the Parc de la Ciutadella\
  \ which I left for the end."
