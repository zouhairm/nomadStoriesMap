Text: "Francesco Tedone: victim of the 12th of July train crash. The outdoor festival\
  \ held in the crowded palazzo was a dedicatory service commemorating the first anniversary\
  \ of the two-train collision just outside of Andria. He was loved. Anna choked back\
  \ tears.\nThe roads were shut down for the festival. This created a hushed, unique\
  \ membrane exclusive to Corato. Everyone laughed with familiarity, grabbed shoulders.\
  \ I stuck out like a sore thumb, labelled \u2018The Boyfriend\u2019. Anna thought\
  \ that was pretty good. \nAnna and her crew, who I\u2019d holidayed with for a week\
  \ in her villa, were the organisers of \"Komorebi\". The word came from Japanese,\
  \ so I was told, in requiem of Francesco's exchange country. It meant, \u201Cthe\
  \ light that shines through the trees\". The flame of anticipation was effusive\
  \ on every face. \nThe festoons, flowers, and fluster of an excitable mass of Italians\
  \ \u2013 all this represented the export of a city with a lot of love. The day unravelled\
  \ into glimmers of sweet light. The craving to catch the proceedings intensified.\
  \ After eating, during which we swiped the bowls dry with bread (an act referred\
  \ to as \u201Cscarpone\u201D in Italian, literally \u201Cboot\u201D), we took an\
  \ espresso to abate the honeyed chains of \"abbiocco\" (the state of sleepiness\
  \ following a grand meal) and set off. The evening was alive with the buzz of mosquitos.\
  \ We tread through Corato with a wakeful sense of the flash-fry ristoranti, the\
  \ vending arcades, the hum of mopeds and cars older than me, the paradisiacal waft\
  \ of the summer breeze mingling with the mouth-watering fetor of panzerotti and\
  \ tomatoey goodness.\nA good way off we could hear antic peddlers and music; the\
  \ people were becoming more involved, busier than before. The lackadaisical children\
  \ were waving at us and popping lightbulbs imaginarily with their finger guns. The\
  \ days were hot; no respite in the night.\nHis obituary placard was placed, significantly,\
  \ inside the train station piazza with a wreath.\nThe mosquitos had been banished\
  \ from the grotto with Raid mosquito coils. The photograph of Francesco in the piazza\
  \ was the first time I'd seen his face; puckish, messy red hair, thick bifocals,\
  \ a smile that'd please the pockets of a dentist, rosy cheeks - this was him, the\
  \ Francesco Tedone who lived and died. Travel is in effect a string of deaths which\
  \ widen the eyes and prick the ears for the notes of that which will soon be dead.\
  \ But this death was hard to stomach. I looked up at the beautiful whitewashed terraces,\
  \ to discover I was crying"
