Text: "I\u2019d really been enjoying Jerusalem. There is underlying tension and pain\
  \ in this city. On a day to day basis though, the people of the old city share the\
  \ sentiment and holiness of the space. This is inspiring.\n\nToday we drive to Bethlehem\
  \ in Palestine. We caress the 25ft wall, topped with barbed wire, that encases the\
  \ Palestinian state. The people inside by no means captive within these walls in\
  \ a literal sense. Free, and even encouraged, to leave at any time. In an economical,\
  \ emotional and spiritual sense though? I\u2019m not sure I have the right to have\
  \ an opinion on such a convoluted and international debate, but there are some things\
  \ you can\u2019t help but feel.\n\nOnce we passed the checkpoint we started to further\
  \ understand life inside these walls. The politically charged graffiti that covers\
  \ the wall tells a story. I even spot a famous Banksy with the saying \u201CMake\
  \ Hummus not War\u201D. \n\nIt was a pleasant surprise when we arrived at our destination.\
  \ Bethlehem was such a quaint yet beautiful town. This is where we first met Mattius.\
  \ He offered a tour of the Church of Nativity. We weren\u2019t planning on doing\
  \ a tour, however, he offered us a very good price. With all we had heard about\
  \ the difficulties this community have been having to make their living inside these\
  \ walls, we wanted to contribute. Turns out this was a great decision and in that\
  \ moment we made a lifelong friend.\n\nWe learned a lot about the church and town.\
  \ In the \u2018Grotto of Nativity\u2019 a star marks the spot where it is believed\
  \ Jesus was born. Silence is observed and you take your time to kneel and touch\
  \ the star that marks the sacred place. A truly moving experience. There is certainly\
  \ an important and historic air to this space.\n\nAfter, we walked up a humbly beautiful\
  \ cobblestone street where we were made fresh Za'atar right there in a stone fire\
  \ oven. We continued to chat to Mattius and learn about the history of the area.\
  \ \n\nI had to ask a burning question before we said goodbye. I turned to him and\
  \ asked him if it was ever difficult being a Christian in Palestine when the majority\
  \ are Muslim. He said first and foremost he and his brothers are Palestinian. Religion\
  \ does not come to mind. He may pray in a church and others may pray in a mosque\
  \ but they are brothers and sisters, united in their identity as Palestinians and\
  \ as people first. I learned a lot in that moment. We have kept in contact with\
  \ Mattius and have even been back to tour more of Palestine with him twice already\
  \ and stayed in his home."
