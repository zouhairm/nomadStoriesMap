Text: "Lost again you fool! You never listen to me, you are always like that. After\
  \ a fight with her best friend Riddhima moved towards her favorite place where she\
  \ finds peace in strangers. \u201CThat\u2019s life\u2019s best thing, Experiences\
  \ teach us how to cling.\u201D\nAfter resigning from job that too relying on a person\
  \ she hardly knows but loves like mad. A friend with whom she met few months back.\
  \ The time they spend together he used to read her writings and always motivates\
  \ her that she deserves better job.\nBenefitting the time she has now she drove\
  \ to Manali. It wasn\u2019t that easy, but it is true \u2018to reach somewhere,\
  \ you need to start somewhere and that is starting only which needs the courage\u2019\
  .\nMaking local connections, clicking pictures with locals. A free bird, the thing\
  \ she always dream of. She felt elated on justifying her tattoos. She passed two\
  \ days that way. Enjoying beer, she heard a laugh that let her heart beat faster.\
  \ She looked around the same laugh followed by the name she thought the laugh belong\
  \ to.\nNeel ! \nShe stood up and moved where he was sitting.\nThey both exchanged\
  \ smiles. The last thing she expected that her first solo trip will bring her to\
  \ her love. The same person she used to be with in the evenings. \nA formal Hi to\
  \ knowing that they both are staying in the same hotel their happiness doubled.\n\
  The universe is planning something.\nHey, Join us in the evening for barbeque.\n\
  Sure.\nNeel and his friends were high on old monk and she on wine. Its 2 now. She\
  \ moved towards the balcony. He followed. There was a moment of silence followed\
  \ by a kiss and it wasn\u2019t a firm one. He asked her to join them for Solang\
  \ valley. She replied she is here on a solo trip.\nThey both went to their respective\
  \ rooms and slept with a smile on their face that night.\nEarly morning she started\
  \ her bike, and it worked as wake up alarm.\nShe was sitting on a platform covered\
  \ with snow, and suddenly a snowball hit her. Happiness knew no bounds after seeing\
  \ him. A bowl of  Maggie added a spice to their talks. \n\u201CI\u2019m leaving\
  \ tomorrow morning\u201D said Riddhima \nWhat?\nYou are here for few more days!\n\
  Yes I were, but one should leave the place he liked the most otherwise there is\
  \ a fear of fallen in love and it hurts because \u2018hills are hills they cannot\
  \ love us back.\u2019 In the end she said thanked Neel.\nWhy?\nYou will find your\
  \ answer soon. Next morning she started her bike and while driving back she thought\
  \ how some people left an impression which is darker than black yet allow to see\
  \ through it."
