Text: "There was enough moonlight bouncing off the snow that I turned off my head\
  \ lamp and let my skis come to a quiet stop. Above me were a billion stars. In front\
  \ of me was a large bull bison, as tall as I was and ten times my weight. It was\
  \ my job to keep him inside the park but you try telling a one-ton wild animal where\
  \ the Yellowstone Park boundary is. The air was so dry and cold, hovering well below\
  \ zero, I couldn't have yelled at him even if I'd wanted to. He was alone, this\
  \ massive creature, and he stood staring at me in much the same way I was staring\
  \ at him: warily. Between us was a thin ribbon of the Madison River, the deepest\
  \ and fastest part that hadn't yet frozen over. There was a small rowboat fetched\
  \ up against my side of the embankment, stuck in the snow. \nKeeping the bison in\
  \ the park was a full time job; it was also a volunteer job. The Montana Department\
  \ of Livestock had decreed that any bison caught outside the park were subject to\
  \ immediate extermination, on the shaky reasoning that they might pass on a deadly\
  \ disease, called brucellosis, to cattle. I say shaky because there hadn't been\
  \ a single instance of such a transference actually happening. Yellowstone is a\
  \ ghost town in the winter and the Montana DOL knew there'd be much less uproar\
  \ over their actions during the cold, dark months. That's where we came in, the\
  \ Buffalo Field Campaign. It was a constant game of cat and mouse: we'd chase the\
  \ bison back in the park and the DOL would wait on the other side, guns drawn.\n\
  On this particular night, however, it was just me and the bison. And the rowboat.\
  \ I stepped out of my skis, hoping I wouldn't punch through the waist-deep snow,\
  \ and made my way over to the boat. The bison kept me in his sights, one large eye\
  \ appraising me all the way. If he charged, I was a goner. He didn't wanna cross\
  \ the Madison, though, so I felt safe. Pushing the little boat out into the water,\
  \ it suddenly caught the current and began drifting away. I must've had brain-freeze\
  \ or something because I leapt after it, a full swan dive onto the two metal seats\
  \ inside the boat. If I'd missed, I'd have ended up in the frigid water, alone and\
  \ miles from help. As it was, I came crashing down so hard on the seats I thought\
  \ I'd broken both my femurs. Also, I had no paddle. The boat spun around as I righted\
  \ myself and it was with helpless chagrin I floated right past the bison, who continued\
  \ watching me for awhile before he turned and nonchalantly made his way back into\
  \ the park."
