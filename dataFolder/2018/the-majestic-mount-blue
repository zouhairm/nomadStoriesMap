Text: "The children from the first session had left. The camp had become a place of\
  \ peace and tranquillity. This could only mean one thing; intersession. The break\
  \ that counsellors got from the moment the first session ended to the moment where\
  \ the second session began. In this break we were free to do what we pleased.  \n\
  \n       I had planned to join a group of counsellors, whom I had gotten on well\
  \ with throughout the time spent working in the camp, on a hike/camping adventure\
  \ up Mount Blue. This mountain can be located in the mount blue state park within\
  \ Maine. There were sixteen of us in total, many of us including myself, were amateurs\
  \ when it came to both hiking and camping. We were off to a good start around halfway\
  \ into our journey to the mountain site when two radio transmissions come through\
  \ right after each other. We were informed of two tornados' approaching two camps\
  \ that were close to this mountain. Que the rain storm. We reached the site after\
  \ taking two wrong turns and met up with our fellow counsellors. We decided to go\
  \ against our better judgements and started upon a hike that may or may not be dangerous.\
  \ \n\n      As we journeyed through the forest, we came across many beautiful views\
  \ that I will cherish as well as the occasional sips of Captain Morgans rum, which\
  \ helped keep our groups morale high through the climb. We finally reached the first\
  \ peak where we set up camp. It was certainly a majestic place, I stopped for a\
  \ moment to gather my breath and look around. The first of my two thing's I last\
  \ expected to see hit me then, A vast lake lay in the centre part of the peak. What\
  \ made it even more mysterious was the fact that there was a random floating island\
  \ in the centre of the lake, with one massive tree towering over it. \n\n     After\
  \ a stormy night of not sleeping and being rocked from side to side thanks to a\
  \ great thunder storm, I hopped, from inside my sleeping bag, over to where a few\
  \ of my peers were laying on top of a smooth rock. As I reached them, I hopped closer\
  \ to the edge, revealing the second last thing I expected to see. Beyond the rock,\
  \ was a sea of green. On closer inspection, I realised that the sea was a beautiful\
  \ canopy of fir trees. I have heard that everything looks beautiful after a storm\
  \ in America, but never did I find myself believing in it until that day. My only\
  \ disappointment was not getting to witness the moose coming out at 4am to drink\
  \ from the lake... but like us humans, I doubt they like stormy weather."
