Text: "A love affair can come in many forms and circumstances, usually when least\
  \ expected. I slipped my winter jacket back on as quietly as I could without being\
  \ noticed, glancing around the room. I crossed my legs, tucking my cold, stiff hands\
  \ under the sides of my legs. The walls were decorated with oriental maroon wallpaper,\
  \ the chairs perfectly placed and plush around low glass tables. Scattered throughout\
  \ the room were a couple of small groups of businessmen in suits speaking in hushed\
  \ tones. The remainder of the cafe remained silent, cold, and intimidating. \nThe\
  \ waiter cautiously approached us, unsure of what to do with two well-dressed foreigners\
  \ and a shaggy looking Japanese man. Our new friend, who was to be our Couchsurfing\
  \ host, had chosen to embark on this little adventure in sweatpants and a mess of\
  \ hair on his head. How did I even get here? \nI sat down hesitantly and ordered\
  \ a coffee, hoping that a big mug of coffee with perfectly steamed milk would emerge,\
  \ but instead, a dainty teacup of watery coffee was served, the kind where you feel\
  \ obligated to awkwardly stick your pinky out to the side as you take each sip.\
  \ I nervously gulped it down in the first couple of minutes, immediately finding\
  \ myself squirming in my chair with nothing else to occupy my hands or distract\
  \ me from my impatient thoughts. Not only was I now caffeine deprived, but my mind\
  \ could think of nothing else but a proper meal and hopefully some good Kobe beef\
  \ or sushi. It was, after all, my first night in Tokyo. I was spending it in a cold\
  \ cafe with strange men and an empty stomach. Not quite what I had imagined. \n\
  After 2 \xBD hours and a 6-page agenda, our host\u2019s coworkers peered over their\
  \ glasses for approval on their teaching techniques and ideas, giddy with pride\
  \ over having two English Speaking English teachers in their presence. I assured\
  \ them I thought their methods were absolutely fantastic and effective, careful\
  \ not to say anything that would spark more conversation, and left it at that. I\
  \ held my breath in anticipation.\nA moment of silence, eternal awkwardness, and\
  \ finally, a giant toothy smile. The leader took off his glasses, stood up, shook\
  \ our hands, and asked, \u201CSo, are you hungry?\u201D Hiding my pleading eyes,\
  \ I shrugged, and replied: \u201CYes, I guess.\u201D It wasn\u2019t long before\
  \ the sake and the sushi flowed, ruining all future sushi I would come in contact\
  \ with. And thus began my sushi love affair, in a basement restaurant in Tokyo,\
  \ steamed windows and all."
