Text: I went to Shirpur...a growing city....and it was just declared as a town...all
  I wantes is to travel there as it is near to me...but a lot of my friends told me
  go to Mumbai it has everything....the pubs, party clubs, boys....but I thought for
  a while am I the kind of a person who travels to cities for pubs or the beauty.....or
  for that city's soul all I came was a result that I will go for soul.....I went
  to Shirpur...and I realised it is not that bad....the lights shinning like always
  but here for everyone it matters that who you are or you are in trouble or not they
  will surely help you....for the first time in search of something that I don't even
  know all I did that keep walking and walking all the way and I talked to people
  whom I thought were approachable....I am 17 years old for me it was acknowledging
  that I did figure out everything and travelled       like hell. I freaked out many
  times but now I love it all....I travelled to Ahmedabad and Mumbai as well all I
  did again that I kept moving with out stopping..
