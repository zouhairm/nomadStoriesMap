Text: "'We should've started much sooner. It's getting dark, and we don't even have\
  \ a tent.' - Jo was starting to be anxious about our last day of 1st hitchiking\
  \ trip, and so was I. Border crossing, just a river away from our destinate country.\
  \ So close, yet so far. \n\nLuckily, a minivan arrives. A brief look inside. Two\
  \ men talking to each other in Turkish. One woman staring at us with a very unfriendly\
  \ look. A man snoring like a tractor on its last days. Another man sending a creepy\
  \ look and blinks his eye. I turn around to Johanna and I already see her answer.\
  \ \n\n'Kazanlak?' - however, I try.\n\n'Istanbul.' - the young girl speaking English\
  \ appears from nowhere. - 'But I'm going to Stara Zagora, so hop in!'\n\nI looked\
  \ at Jo already taking our backpacks looking surprisingly sure of her decision.\
  \ Well, she's the responsible one in our duo.\n\n'So where are you from?' - asks\
  \ Maria, once we sit next to her.\n\n'I'm Polish, my friend is from Germany'.\n\n\
  'Oh! Cool! Which city in Poland are you from?' - she asked in perfect Polish.\n\n\
  'How the heck you speak... You probably don't know it anyway.'\n\n'Try me! I spent\
  \ two years in Poland.' - so that's why she speaks my language!\n\n'Zielona Gora..\
  \ See? I told you...'\n\n'How wouldn't I? That's where I was all this time.'\n\n\
  'No way! Where?'\n\n'At the gas station near Mc'Donald's'.\n\n'The famous after\
  \ party hot-dog place!' - I say with smile and then I see her face.\n\n'Don't even...'\n\
  \n'... I knew I know you!'\n\nOnce I'm picking my jaw from the floor she says: 'You\
  \ made my day. It was one of these days that you don't want to get out off bed because\
  \ you know, it'll get only worse. And so it was. All day, plus these bloody drunk\
  \ teens coming back from party, being rude..'\n\n'Was I one of those drunkies getting\
  \ hot - dogs?' (hope not, there's no way out anymore)\n\n'Yes. But you were the\
  \ first person, who smiled to me and asked, how am I and why am I so sad. You said\
  \ to me that I looked like I needed a hug. And you hugged me. Just like that. And\
  \ the bad day disappeared.'\n\n'Let me thank you for that. you don't even know how\
  \ much it meant to me. Stay at my place tonight. It's too late to hitchike now.\
  \ I'm going to Kazanlak first thing in the morning tomorrow. Please, let my family\
  \ meet my day savior.'\n\nAnd that's how we got to stay a night with a huge, amazing\
  \ Gypsy family at their home. But that's another story to tell."
