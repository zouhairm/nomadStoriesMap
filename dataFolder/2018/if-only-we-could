Text: If only we could. For someone a part of this generation.. I ask the question
  why? Why can't a good morning mean a good morning without the hussle and bustle
  of reality? Why can't I love you,  mean that you mean it? Why must me always struggle
  and strive toward something that we know we're good at,  but why should society
  question?  Always always in time. Why right now are we not perfect?  Who sets the
  bar? Who should we be?  Are we mocked go  being our selves or are we mocked for
  me being not! Why should there be a freedom of expression?  Weren't we born with
  that without the government imposing that? Who are we?  What are we?  How should
  we be?  Should we be happy being in our own skin? Or should we just be happy?  Or
  should we just.... Move. We always look for happiness from our jobs when we try
  to take a trip to the mountains and see the snowy mountains or dip our feet in the
  calm of the sea, trying just trying to ease some part of our humanity wishing we
  our heroes,  bit the again it always strikes, reality. Should we go down in reality
  or should we strike?  Will we be able to go back or should we strike? How long will
  humanity strike us or can we live?  Being young,  and will and free?  Through the
  mountains,  through the storm,  through the dessert,  thought the rain, through
  life and thought love? Its not easy, but then someone captured in all this movement,  will
  laugh hahha and say well hey that's life...
