Text: "As the only guest at Estancia Harberton, my thoughts found expression in Paul\
  \ Theroux's words in The Old Patagonian Express - \"It was near enough to the end\
  \ of the earth to give me the impression that I was a solitary explorer in a strange\
  \ land\".\n\nA narrow strip of verdant grass and pebble beach lay between my cottage\
  \ and the waters of the Beagle Channel. The silence was exquisite as I watched the\
  \ sun set over the silvery waters where a pair of steamer ducks glided by.\n \n\
  \ Indigenous tribes inhabited this wild inhospitable land of Tierra del Fuego for\
  \ thousands of years. Charles Darwin, Captain Fitzroy and Magellan were among the\
  \ explorers and scientists that came and went. But it was Thomas Bridges who came\
  \ and stayed. This devoted English missionary based in the Falklands, sailed the\
  \ Beagle Channel and worked tirelessly with the Yaghan people before he settled\
  \ permanently on the island in 1871.\n\nGripped by tales about the Land of Fire,\
  \ it was to the Bridges farm at the edge of the South American continent that I\
  \ eventually decided to travel. \n\nIn this idyllic setting it was difficult to\
  \ envisage the wild seas that claimed many lives and the harsh living conditions\
  \ of Thomas Bridges and his family. With perseverance they learnt the rich, expressive\
  \ language of the Yaghan people and their complex culture. A compelling read is\
  \ son Lucas' book, \"The Uttermost Part of the Earth\", which relates their lives\
  \ as the first white settlers among the Fuegian tribes.\n\nThe next day the sun\
  \ shone gloriously and the autumn air was crisp and cold. On my guided walk around\
  \ the peninsula I learnt about the different species of Nothofagus trees, Calafate\
  \ bushes, Magellanic woodpeckers, a Patagonian grey fox, to name a few. Breathtaking\
  \ views of the Beagle Channel islands beckoned to Antarctica beyond. \n\nOn return\
  \ to my cottage the only sound was two black feral horses peacefully grazing, unperturbed\
  \ by my presence.\n\nThat night the weather had a surprise for me. I lay there listening\
  \ to the wild wind that causes permanent leaning \"flag trees\".  The more it howled\
  \ the more mercilessly the rain beat on the roof and window pane. My imagination\
  \ took flight to shipwrecks and pirates of a bygone era.\n\nThere was no sun to\
  \ greet me in the morning only a transformed landscape. Ghostly grey and covered\
  \ with snow.\n\nI left the rugged beauty of this last frontier inspired by the brave\
  \ men and women who had lived life on the edge - both literally and figuratively."
