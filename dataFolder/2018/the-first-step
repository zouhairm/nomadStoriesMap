Text: "As I was flying over my big beautiful country watching the prairies unfold\
  \ beneath us, there was a smile across my face. So much work to get to this point.\
  \ The last 2 weeks have been a nightmare and everything that could go wrong did.\
  \ I was push to my limit and could of gave up on this crazy idea of mine many times.\
  \ But I made it, no matter what I was getting on that plane. I felt worried, scared,\
  \ nervous, a little sick to my stomach but mostly more excited I have ever been\
  \ in my entire life. The best part though, was the freedom I felt. Free of every\
  \ responsibilities back home, free of schedules, free to explore the world and free\
  \ to do whatever I want for the next 100 days. Every great journey begins with a\
  \ single step. Mine was in London, United Kingdom. No plans was made prior and I\
  \ proudly took my first step out of the airport and on to a train station. The train\
  \ is filled with business men and woman dress in suits and reading their newspaper.\
  \ I smile thinking  to myself of how typical this look. It feels like we have been\
  \ going through a city the whole time even though I am sure I read the Gatwick airport\
  \ was outside London , but the red building stack one beside the other just keep\
  \ on rolling. Everything looks older to me and so beautiful even though I\u2019\
  m only sitting from a train seat . Once we get to Victoria station I head out of\
  \ the door. I got my big yellow backpack and I take a big breath of somewhat fresh\
  \ Europe air. I am so happy. As I stand there enjoying the view of the green park\
  \ in front of us , the cars driving by going the wrong way and the people going\
  \ about their business, a red double decker bus stop right in front of me. Of course\
  \ I hop right on and head for the top seat . The bus keep going and I feel like\
  \ we are part of that Harry Potter scene when the purple bus goes a millions miles\
  \ an hour across the city. I watch as the city unroll , quickly, in front of me.\
  \ After a while the bus driver stop and I am force to come out in middle of nowhere.\
  \ I head out for a walk but I feel exhausted and hope to find a place to rest soon\
  \ and i quickly do. I stand in front of this tall black wooded building with a half\
  \ hanging sign saying \u201CHostel\u201D.  I book myself my first bunk bed and lay\
  \ there for one minute before my fatigue takeover me and puts me to sleep before\
  \ I can overthink anything else about this bizzard hostel....all I know for now,\
  \ is this decision that push me to the edge back home, was definitely all worth\
  \ it !"
