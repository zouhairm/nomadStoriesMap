Text: "With hearts in my eyes n the ever so famous kiss right in front of the Eiffel\
  \ Tower on my mind, I embarked on my journey with tons of excitement. My trip to\
  \ Paris pushed me to the edge but trust me definitely in a mighty positive way.\
  \ After being a mother of two and the brats ensuring that they are literally my\
  \ shadows, traveling alone was a bit of an alien concept initially. Well Being the\
  \ kind soul I am \U0001F609 I appreciated beauty right at the etihad airways counter\
  \ as the girl wore the most attractive and bright red lip stick. Was it the lipstick\
  \ or the shape of her full lips that got my attention, I don\u2019t know but finally\
  \ it made me land up with an upgrade to business class seat. Oo la la this trip\
  \ was just starting to get fun. Expecting chaos and mayhem to my surprise Paris\
  \ airport was nice, quaint and much organised so much so that a rookie like me felt\
  \ at home. You could call this my second honeymoon n my HONEY \U0001F61C waited\
  \ right outside the airport. Seeing him I knew i could be my crazy and bindaas (free\
  \ spirit) self now. The beauty of paris is embedded in nearly every little thing,\
  \ so be it the carefully carved tiny little balconies in front of each and every\
  \ window or the well thought of and neatly landscaped parks or the bistro\u2019\
  s where we did sit every once in a while to grab the local beer, Paris\u2019 is\
  \ truly so beautiful and mesmerising. After surrendering to the beauty of this place\
  \ it was time to do justice to the fact that we were alone I.e without kids \U0001F62C\
  \ and without going into the details of course all I can say is that yes this trip\
  \ did bring me to the edge, literally and otherwise. We kept shopping for the last\
  \ days and nearly covered all the places I.e the Eiffel Tower, the grand louvre,\
  \ the cruise, the famous shopping lane, getting clicked at the Louis Vuitton showroom\
  \ \U0001F637 to sitting at various eating places and exploring the local vibe...people\
  \ told me going in feb isn\u2019t such a great idea considering the cold however\
  \ I strongly recommend that one should visit during this season if u wanna see the\
  \ naked beauty of blacks and greys with the chill ensuring that you keep yourself\
  \ safe and cozy, yup I guess this was another reason for me to be perpetually in\
  \ the arms of my man in this lovely city of love and romance... so guys that\u2019\
  s a bit of my journey, hope you enjoyed... Visitng Paris at least once in your lifetime\
  \ is not required but a necessity.... time that you push yourself to the edge too\
  \ \U0001F609\U0001F60A keep smiling!!!"
