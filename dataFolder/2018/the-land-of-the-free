Text: "Have you ever felt like you were drowning? Drowning in disappointment? I couldn\u2019\
  t help myself. My heart skipped a beat when I saw the ranger approaching us. I glanced\
  \ at Anthony, but he just winked and welcomed the ranger with a big smile. And as\
  \ if he had put a magical spell on me, I suddenly remembered his words clearly:\
  \ \u201CProve them wrong!\u201D\nI was convinced everything had changed. I thought\
  \ I had finally gathered all the bravery and courage to travel this big, dry country\
  \ all by myself. But it was not until I met Anthony that I realized I was everything\
  \ other than self-confident. In fact, I was an insecure human being and a splendid\
  \ actor. I wanted to be different and see Australia from a different perspective,\
  \ but there was always a gut feeling, telling me I just wasn\u2019t ready. A gut\
  \ feeling and an invisible bubble. I named it \u201Ccomfort zone\u201D. \u201CIt\u2019\
  s too dangerous!\u201D Always the same. It was society, telling me to conform, leaving\
  \ my head spinning and crushing in self-doubt. And I believed it. Because society\
  \ is always right. Right?\nNonetheless, as if it was destiny, I met a local called\
  \ Anthony on a random, hot day in Western Australia and for some reason, I developed\
  \ a strange desire to get to know him better. He was a traveller himself, but unlike\
  \ other people, he never followed the crowds and developed an attitude that left\
  \ me speechless.\u201CCan, Will, Did\u201D, he said. \u201CPeople try to stop you?\
  \ Go and prove them wrong!\u201D There it was again; the gut feeling. But it felt\
  \ different this time, it was as if my soul had been lit on fire. \u201CThey call\
  \ it \u2018Wanderlust\u2019!\u201D He must have noticed my nervousness.\nBonding\
  \ over the same fire in our souls, he decided to take me on a road trip in his old\
  \ Ute. But there was one little detail that he had withheld from me: Poorly working\
  \ brakes. I couldn\u2019t have been any more content until a crash into a bush woke\
  \ me up. Immediately, I checked whether he was okay, but he just snickered. My disappointed\
  \ reached a maximum when a ranger asked us to leave. However, there was nothing\
  \ that could stop Anthony from reaching Australia\u2019s westernmost point. Pretending\
  \ to have fixed the brakes, driving steady, but slowly, always keeping an eye out\
  \ for the ranger, we lastly reached majestic cliffs. \u2018This is it! This is the\
  \ real Australia!\u2019, I was convinced.\n\u201CCan-Will-Did\u201D, as if it has\
  \ been branded into my soul, I ultimately knew that it was not about what society\
  \ tells you to do, but what your heart desires. The power of words is truly unpredictable."
