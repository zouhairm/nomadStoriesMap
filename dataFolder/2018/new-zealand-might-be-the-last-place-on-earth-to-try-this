Text: "I squint down the deserted highway as heat ripples from New Zealand\u2019s\
  \ State Highway 6. My overstuffed 60-liter travel pack is buckled around my hips,\
  \ but the straps still drive into the tops of my sunburnt shoulders. Sweat trickles\
  \ to the tip of my nose. I swallow hard, look into the pack of cars blurring on\
  \ the horizon, and I stick my thumb into oncoming traffic. The bead of sweat drops\
  \ on the dry pavement.\n\nSome backpackers shrug off hitch-hiking like they\u2019\
  re choosing between Shreddies or Cheerios \u2013 it\u2019s just a matter of choice,\
  \ or even habit. Other traveller\u2019s eyes blossom with admiration and fear. The\
  \ remaining sceptics eye you like you must be criminal to resort to something so\
  \ reckless. \n\nSince 1970 there have only been 9 hitch-hiking related murders,\
  \ but New Zealand\u2019s violent crime rate is still 11th worldwide. Of course,\
  \ I only bothered to look this up after I started hitching. I tried it because it\
  \ felt like a rite of backpacker passage \u2013 because I might regret not giving\
  \ it a shot.\n\nThe first driver to stiff me doesn\u2019t flinch at my outstretched\
  \ thumb. In the second car, two women sit with focused gazes, the passenger\u2019\
  s ring-bearing hand resting idly on the windowsill. When the third car finally slows,\
  \ I exhale in relief until I see their blinker flashing and realise they\u2019re\
  \ turning. \n\nThen a single low-riding UTE cruises up. A sinister baseline vibrates\
  \ my ribs. The sun glints on the driver\u2019s orange aviators, and his buddy sits\
  \ in the passenger seat. Don\u2019t slow down, I think, don\u2019t slow down. I\
  \ twist my body away from the road, but he holds my gaze as he glides past before\
  \ hitting the gas in an explosive show. This was a cavalier idea. I glare at the\
  \ hot road tersely, letting my fear and my determination coalesce. \n\nI\u2019m\
  \ still hypnotized by the road when up beat-up white Nissan hatchpack pulls onto\
  \ the shoulder in a scatter of gravel and dust. A stocky, boyish farm-boy wearing\
  \ a dirt-flecked t-shirt and cargo-shorts pops out from the driver\u2019s side.\
  \ He tilts his head and smiles. \u201CCeilidh, is that you?\u201D\n\nIt couldn\u2019\
  t be \u2013 but it is! Dylan the dairy farmer\u2019s son - whose parents know my\
  \ parents. I dart towards his stubbled, sun-scorched grin. \u201CDude, why are you\
  \ out here alone?\u201D he opens the trunk and I plonk my pack beside a dirty towel\
  \ and a plastic grooming kit. His car sinks under the weight. \n\n\u201CI\u2019\
  m hitch-hiking, what does it look like I\u2019m doing?\u201D I get in his cobwebbed\
  \ car and fasten the hot seatbelt, stare at the empty two-lane. Now that\u2019s\
  \ luck."
