Text: "It\u2019s been two years since I visited Morocco, yet the memories are fresh\
  \ and vivid. While I was in Morocco, I met a Moroccan girl and we soon became very\
  \ good friends. I wanted to get the gist of the Moroccan culture and had asked her\
  \ to accompany me to the south. She looked at me with a spark in her eyes and with\
  \ a radiant smile she replied, \u2018Yes, I would love to\u2019. On our way to the\
  \ Sahara, we visited Marrakesh, and Ouarzazate and felt as if these places are directly\
  \ taken out of our history books. Tall buildings made of mud & clay adorned with\
  \ elegant carvings and by traditional mats made us feel as if we were in the era\
  \ of the Arabian nights.  As I stood in the middle of a narrow lane admiring the\
  \ view, someone from behind shouted \u2018Balak!\u2019 (move aside) and before I\
  \ could retract my senses, my friend pushed me aside if not I would have been kissing\
  \ the ground.\nWe left for Sahara the next day on camels. After a long ride and\
  \ witnessing some magnificent scenery, we reached our tents. The sun was about to\
  \ set and wanting to catch a glimpse of it, I challenged my friend to have a race\
  \ on top of the sand dune which felt easy at first but was indeed challenging. The\
  \ harder we climbed, the faster we fall back. The winds were strong, I could feel\
  \ each grain of sand touching my skin like someone was firing bullets at me, yet\
  \ it felt wonderful. With much effort, we reached the top of the sand dune before\
  \ the sunset only to be awestruck with what we witnessed. The sun casted its golden\
  \ rays down upon the clouds which felt like a perfect marriage between the two realms\
  \ while we stood there with an unwavering gaze and saw the sun slowly sink beneath\
  \ the horizon.\nSatisfied with the view, we headed back to our tents where the camp\
  \ head, a Berber by birth and a very generous man by nature, lit the campfire and\
  \ played traditional musical instrument called \u2018Gnawa\u2019 for us while we\
  \ treated ourselves with some delicious watermelon and traditional dishes like \u2018\
  Tajine\u2019 and \u2018Cous-cous\u2019. After a pleasant meal, I and my Moroccan\
  \ friend decided to take a small walk around the tent and then we lied down on the\
  \ soft Saharan sand that was comforting us just as a mother comforts her child as\
  \ we gazed upon the millions of bright stars dotted on the canvas of night sky adorning\
  \ it like the jewels adorning a women\u2019s neck. This magnificent view made us\
  \ ponder on some thought-provoking questions about the purpose of life. That night\
  \ with my Moroccan friend was truly a night worth living for."
