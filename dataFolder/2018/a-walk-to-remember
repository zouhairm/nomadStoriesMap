Text: "\u201CHey, wake up! You\u2019re not allowed to doze on holiday!\u201D Mira\u2019\
  s voice has all of a sudden interfered with my sweet nap.\n \nI lazily opened my\
  \ eyes, cracked my neck and instantly was excited! A bright green field of grass\
  \ was opening out and I\u2019ve finally remembered we were only in a break from\
  \ Vienna\u2019s museums: Schonbrunn Palace, Mozart Haus, Belvedere Museum\u2026\
  \ all ticked off in a single day. We were exhausted, so to keep laying on a park\
  \ bench seemed a perfect idea. The peaceful vibe didn't last again as a sudden bustle\
  \ exploded sharply in the air.\n\nOn the meadow, three men and two women, all dressed\
  \ in green t-shirts, were laughing loudly. Moving all around, twisting in acrobatics,\
  \ walking the tightrope and juggling. I got hooked right away and started a journey\
  \ to the backstage of the circus world, while fulfilling my dream to see how the\
  \ magic is built. While I was enjoying, in delight, my front row seat for the tightrope\
  \ walking performance, reality struck heartlessly when I heard:\n \n\u201CGirls,\
  \ do you wanna try?\u201D Girls? Which girls? Try what?\n \nA fruity voice came\
  \ from nowhere interfered with my fascination for the acrobats\u2019 performance.\n\
  \ \n\u201CI spotted your smiles when watching us! Feel free to join, learn a little\
  \ bit!\u201D\n \nThe taller, younger tightrope walker had just invited us to unravel\
  \ the tightrope walking secrets in the most unexpected way. I jumped into the challenge\
  \ straight off!  \n \nHowever, on the way to my little Viennese circus adventure\
  \ a powerful voice started to scream inside of me: \u201CJesus Christ, you\u2019\
  re in a foreign country and this is dangerous, there is NO point in trying something\
  \ you won't succeed at anyway!\u201D Poisoned with these thoughts I climbed the\
  \ tightrope, felt it cold as a snake and I had not even stepped forward one centimeter\
  \ because my shaking legs collapsed on the grass.\n \n\u201CYou go girl! Best photo\
  \ of your life is waiting for you!\u201D I heard all of a sudden Mira cheering me\
  \ up.\n \nShaking off the frustration I then grabbed the young tall guy\u2019s hand\
  \ and climbed the tightrope again. I stopped for a few seconds, to feel and understand\
  \ what was under my feet.\n\nOne step\u2026stop\u2026think\u2026.don\u2019t think\u2026\
  one step more\u2026breath\u2026another step\u2026and another\u2026tense\u2026balance\u2026\
  final step.\n\nA thousand molecules of adrenaline turned into pride and boosted\
  \ inside me as I heard the others clapping my performance. I then knew a little\
  \ step on the tightrope meant a huge step in the battle with fears!\n\nIt was now\
  \ the time for me and Mira to grab a Wiener Apfelstrudel!"
