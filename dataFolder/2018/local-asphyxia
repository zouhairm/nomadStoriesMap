Text: "I left home at 31, more due to social pressure than to my own will. With a\
  \ backpack full of clothes I escaped my native city toward the capital city, behind\
  \ the stubborn dream of becoming a writer and living under the influence of the\
  \ word.\n\nIn Bogot\xE1 I learned the ropes. I worked for many and for none. I fell\
  \ in love and learned to hate love. I cried and learned to value a red tomato on\
  \ a rainy midnight.\n\nDuring five years I enjoyed from those benefits, until one\
  \ day local asphyxia took hold of me, the uneasiness of finding myself trapped in\
  \ a country full of different cultures and with many contrasts, but, deep down,\
  \ the same amnesia.\n\nThen I opened my eyes and worked like crazy to seat my ass\
  \ in the reclining seat of a plane and see for myself that other ways were possible,\
  \ and other logics too, and I was able, ladies and gentlemen, to eat other things,\
  \ to hear other things, to unlearn and shed off a great deal of silliness. Finally,\
  \ I needed, urgently, to see how magical and despicable could be my earthling brothers\
  \ in other latitudes.\n\nI went to Isla del Sol. The 14 Color Mountain. Buenos Aires.\
  \ La Paz. Neptunia. I went to Machi Picchu. Salar de Uyini, and other places. All\
  \ of this in three months, which left me, among many memories, two final teachings.\n\
  \nTravelling brings closer together or it separates, but something always gets broken\
  \ forever. To be away from our comfort zone, our loved ones and hated ones, it makes\
  \ possible reflections and perspectives we would have never reached while inside\
  \ the circle we build for ourselves. It is during the trip that we have the epiphany,\
  \ and you discover who is there for you and who is not.\n\nTravelling doesn\u2019\
  t take you anywhere, because wherever you go you\u2019ll be you, with your quilombos\
  \ and fears and exes and your strife with the world and with the past. And no matter\
  \ how magnificent the scenery in front of you is, you, and your shadow over it,\
  \ will be bigger. To travel, at the end, is to amplify the idea of beauty, but remember\
  \ that beauty can also be macabre.\n\nAuthor\u2019s note\nI hope I can continue\
  \ with the second part of my journey into the heart of the south. I still have a\
  \ lot of land to translate into worded images."
