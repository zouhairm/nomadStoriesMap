Text: "\u201CAre you prepared for the performance tonight?\u201D \n\nThis seems to\
  \ be a trick question. Since I\u2019m not the one performing tonight. As the soundcheck\
  \ of their unrestrained rock songs fade into the mountains, Tsering is grinning\
  \ at me widely. He has been practising tirelessly with his troupe.\n\nI can\u2019\
  t help but smile back, \u201CI\u2019m not the one who has to uphold centuries of\
  \ traditions. You look like you haven\u2019t slept well.\u201D Tsering\u2019s throaty\
  \ laugh echoes around us, as we begin our trek uphill. The festival is at the top\
  \ of a hill, a few kilometres trek from Tsering\u2019s home, where his family graciously\
  \ hosts guests in Dharamshala. While staying with them, I met and befriended their\
  \ ever cheerful and infinitely talented son.\n\nWe\u2019ve barely made it a third\
  \ into our journey, when a familiar man comes around the hairpin, and seeing Tsering,\
  \ rattles off in Tibetan. But I understand the shock and distress on my friend\u2019\
  s face well enough. The newcomer swings his arm towards the festival camp, and runs\
  \ off again.\n\nOur journey is more ponderous this time. Me gazing at the mountains,\
  \ wondering what could have happened to upset this peaceable community. And, Tsering,\
  \ focused on the road, restlessly clenching and unclenching his guitar strap. When\
  \ he finally speaks, it\u2019s almost jarring in the silence.\n\n\u201CThere is\
  \ news from home. From Tibet.\u201D Tsering seems to struggle for words. For breath.\
  \ \u201CThere have been more protests. We\u2019re to expect photos tomorrow.\u201D\
  \n\nHe doesn\u2019t need to explain himself. There are Tibetans fighting the resistance\
  \ from within; fighting for their rights, for their exiled spiritual leader. And\
  \ when there are self immolations, photos are smuggled to refugees for identification.\n\
  \nAs the other musicians perform, the mood has changed, permeating the crisp mountain\
  \ air, affecting even the tourists amongst us.\n\nThen Tsering starts a haunting\
  \ Amdo folk song, accompanied only by his guitar and a dramyin (Tibetan lute). The\
  \ words rise and fall, and wrap themselves around us. The soft twilight sky paints\
  \ the lush landscape with oranges and violets and blues. The mountains seem to grow\
  \ to fill the entire space. Earth and sky collide at the horizon, until we don\u2019\
  t know which is mightier. And just beyond the horizon, so close, lay their home.\
  \ \n\nFor almost an hour, his voice resounds in all directions, sometimes soft and\
  \ low, sometimes impassioned and cracking. And around me, Tibetans, exiles, his\
  \ friends, my hosts, stand silent.\n\nI really wasn\u2019t prepared for that performance."
