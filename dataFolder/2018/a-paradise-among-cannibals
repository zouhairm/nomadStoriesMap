Text: "Known to be a land of cannibals-Papua New Guinea-Its the only place i found\
  \ where humans dont eat each other.And having spoken about the cannibals part, the\
  \ Cannabis here is something worth trying.Just what the bird in country's national\
  \ flag symbolises, people here are free of any time restrictions & Everything happens\
  \ at its own pace.They dont get much tourists here being blacklisted as criminal\
  \ and dangerous for tourists.However when they do they make sure that the tourist\
  \ comes back to them with a smile.\nI travelled here for 7 days in 2 main cities\
  \ (Alotau & Kimbe) and 1 village (Oro Bay).As the theme of my story is 'making a\
  \ local connection', you dont have to make an effort connecting with the people\
  \ here.Thats the beauty of this country.I met a person who was intoxicated, came\
  \ to me & said \"you look beautiful, we dont get to see much beautiful people around\
  \ here\". \nNext we went to the village Oro Bay.Everyone waved at us asking how\
  \ are you, we became the center of attraction of the village.Almost the whole village\
  \ followed us wherever we went. We went for the mountains where we saw an only house.An\
  \ old man lived there alone.He made that tree house by himself and had huge quantities\
  \ of land in possession with him.He asked us to tell our (Indian) government, to\
  \ come and invest here.Being his guest, though unexpected, he served us with cannabis\
  \ which is quite the trend here even though cannabis being illegal in this country.Later\
  \ he got some fresh cut coconuts for us.Never in my life i had got such hospitality.\
  \ There was this positive vibe.\nNext came the city Kimbe.As we went to the inside\
  \ of this city following after 2 hours we reached a place with waterfall and hot\
  \ springs in the middle of the jungle.We enjoyed there until we saw some really\
  \ distinctive people in a group with somewhat hungry eyes.As our heartbeats picked\
  \ up, they turned out to be very warm friends and we blended in perfect.They were\
  \ college students who sold garbage to study in an average college.They carried\
  \ ambitions as simple as having a concrete roof on top and getting to eat till satisfaction\
  \ everyday.Aimless but happy.People there carried medium sized speakers in a bag\
  \ of net at their backs.There were shoes hanging on the electric cables there, we\
  \ asked the reason for the same when they said that instead of throwing they hang\
  \ it up there so that the needy can pick them up from the top without having to\
  \ beg anyone.\nA poor country rich by its nature and open hearted souls."
