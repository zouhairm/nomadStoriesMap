Text: "\u201CBe careful, sometimes vomit.\u201D These were the last words So San,\
  \ local artist and Airbnb host, said to me before he went out for the night and\
  \ left me in charge of his three overzealous cats.\n\nI had a list of instructions\
  \ that demanded vigilance to ensure they would not escape. Joshu liked his tummy\
  \ rubbed, Nonsense liked a cuddle and Emme liked to jump on shoulders. The trio\
  \ lived up to Japan\u2019s reputation for excellent hospitality, however I would\
  \ have welcomed a bit more space. Having brushed my teeth, I opened the door only\
  \ to see a ginger blur jump straight into the toilet. There was nothing in the instructions\
  \ about that.\n\nAfter a restless night, with the cats scratching the rice paper\
  \ walls until the early hours, I got on the museum trail. I was visiting Naoshima,\
  \ an extraordinary \u2018art island\u2019, tucked away in this previously forgotten\
  \ corner of Japan. With Tadao Ando\u2019s concrete \u2018artchitecture\u2019 juxtaposed\
  \ against the green landscape, it is easy to see why it was chosen as a location\
  \ for a modern James Bond book; I was half expecting to walk into a control room\
  \ with Blofeld stroking Emme.\n\nMy first stop was The Chichu Art Museum, permanent\
  \ home to all five of Claude Monet\u2019s Water Lily paintings. They are exquisitely\
  \ presented in a white room with natural light, marble tiling and curved walls,\
  \ to create an uninterrupted garden of water. I get so close to each painting, that\
  \ they become disparate dots of colour, before walking backwards until they start\
  \ to make sense.\n\nThe museum also houses James Turrell\u2019s immersive installation,\
  \ Open Field. You ascend a number of steps to a pale blue rectangle, before entering\
  \ a neon room of uninterpretable size. The feeling is so disorientating that the\
  \ museum assistants have to let you know how far you can walk to avoid bumping into\
  \ the wall.\n\nAfterwards, everything appeared to be in soft focus. I ambled about\
  \ in a dreamlike state, visiting more museums and walking along the beach to Yayoi\u2019\
  s iconic pumpkin. It was hard to tell whether it was the setting sun that gave the\
  \ island a purple glow, or whether my eyes had been temporarily affected by Turrell\u2019\
  s work.\n\nThat night, I was not the sole biped in my lodgings, as So San had a\
  \ few moptopped friends over for dinner. They fed me and played The Beatles in my\
  \ honour.\n\u201CCan you eat Japanese food?\u201D\n\u201CYou're good with chopsticks!\u201D\
  \nThese were the two most common things locals said to me. Hearing them again reminded\
  \ me that I was indeed in Japan, not a supervillain\u2019s lair."
