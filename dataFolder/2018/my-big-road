Text: "The road was dusty. The sun was high and the heat was unbearable. The wind\
  \ almost was not. In the car, slept a little Barbara, which only a week ago made\
  \ his first step. She was hot in infant car seat. But the windows open was impossible.\
  \ The air conditioner didn't work. In the car included a cold air stream. And so\
  \ we drove\u2026\nIt was our first trip together. It was the hope. After Barbara\u2019\
  s birth our relationship has changed. Wanted some fresh air. Wanted to change. Understand.\
  \ Take. Love a new rhythm and a new life.\nWe drove through the area in the direction\
  \ Braslav lakes. This is the heart of Belarus. There are many small lakes in one\
  \ place. Silence. Beautifully. The minimum of people. Max you.\nThe speed was small.\
  \ While one section of the road was replaced by another, I see the area. There were\
  \ fields around. Amber. Sloping. It was evident that the time to harvest came, but\
  \ in this heat in the fields there was no machinery or people. Just bare fields.\
  \ I looked at them yellow smooth surface and I could hear the song. From the childhood.\
  \ And laughter. Grandmohter sang. Not for me. Yourself. But I liked it a lot. And\
  \ I often asked her to sing it to me. I miss for her.\nForests replaced fields.\
  \ The forest was long, but where they hovered over the road, it seemed a different\
  \ world begins. There were pines. Trees and deciduous trees come across occasionally.\n\
  The road began to wobble and the car slowed down. I saw the fisherman. In boots\
  \ with a fishing rod. And with a bucket. I didn't know why he needed a bucket. The\
  \ fisherman left behind, and in front was the sun.\nIt was late evening. The heat\
  \ subsided and Barbara wake up. I got the book \u2013 the story of the Gruffalo\
  \ \u2013 and she began to read. She has smiling. When the story ended I offered\
  \ her a drink of water and she greedily sucked his bottle.\nWe moved into some small\
  \ town and I asked to stop because I have to feed Barbara. And at this amazing moment,\
  \ here in an unfamiliar little town, hearing the song of the fields and feeling\
  \ the breath of the pines, I realized that everything that happens to me is amazing\
  \ and unique. And I wanted to cry. But I thought it might spoil the taste of milk.\
  \ I don\u2019t crying.\nThe car moved on. The road became like a trail and soon\
  \ we saw the first lake \u2013 Drivyaty. Barbara started crying. Our journey has\
  \ just begun."
