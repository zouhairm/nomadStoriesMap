Text: "A clich\xE9 of Pacific island Paradise. The guesthouse run by a local family.\
  \ A treehouse ladder to scramble up to my bedroom. Cooked bananas for dinner, a\
  \ classic local dish. Friendly children, on holiday from school. My host is a Tongan-sized\
  \ man, who mingles a traditional Pacific lifestyle with modern hospitality. Every\
  \ night I see his boat head out to catch fish. The days begin with hot fresh bread,\
  \ then we sightsee and dive. He swims among the fish, calling them with his fingers\
  \ as if they are his friends. Even better, I am the only Westerner. Paradise indeed.\
  \ \n\nOr hell, because the island has just hosted Cyclone Gita. We use ladders because\
  \ the staircase collapsed. The trees are dying, crops destroyed. The children are\
  \ on holiday because they lack a school building. The men fish because there is\
  \ so little food. They go every night because the fish have not returned. No produce\
  \ in the market. Island shops are short on goods. We eat bananas because there is\
  \ little else. Australia sent aid, but little has reached the villages. My guesthouse\
  \ family sleep in one undamaged room at the guesthouse, surrounded by piles of uncleared\
  \ rubbish. We clamber over fallen timbers to get to the broken-walled bathroom,\
  \ and watch the ferry every day for aid.\n\nThe mother is pregnant. Every morning\
  \ she gets up before daylight and goes vainly to see if there is food at the market.\
  \ I have three children of my own, a rucksack full of dried food, and a midwife\
  \ friend who can advise by distance as to antenatal nutrition. She recommends I\
  \ give the dried apricots, raisins and vitamin enriched juice sachets to the mother.\
  \ I am to accompany it with reassurance that at six months gestation, with a previously\
  \ balanced diet, her placenta can cope with a brief famine. I do as I am asked.\
  \ Her face lights up with relief.\n\nThe next morning he calls me over. Here. A\
  \ lobster I caught. I have cooked it for you. He holds it tenderly, the way he calls\
  \ to the fish on our scuba trips. A thank you for the support I have given his wife.\
  \ But there is just one problem: I follow  Jewish dietary laws, which means no shellfish.\
  \ I look at this man. Tongans are proud, it is hard to receive aid. We all need\
  \ opportunities to give as well as to receive. He needs to keep his dignity. Hell\
  \ is other people, when we are too rigid to care for others. I put aside my own\
  \ cultural needs, thank him, and eat."
