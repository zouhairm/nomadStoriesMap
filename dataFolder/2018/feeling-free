Text: "\u201CI\u2019d like the pork souvlaki, please,\u201D I tell my waiter, not\
  \ entirely understanding what I\u2019m ordering.Sitting alone at an outdoor cafe\
  \ selected because of its view of the Acropolis, is this American woman on the most\
  \ patriotic day of the year.Spending 4th of July in a foreign country for the very\
  \ first time I want the closest thing to BBQ.After placing 2 skewers of craftily\
  \ seasoned pork with a mound of glazed potato wedges & a ramekin of yogurt dressing\
  \ before me, my server announces he\u2019ll be off work soon & \u201CWhat should\
  \ we do next?\u201D With skewer paused halfway to my lips, I take him in: mid 30s,\
  \ earnest, handsome, & not joking. \u201COh, well, I\u2019m heading over to the\
  \ Temple of Zeus after this.You can join me if you want.\u201D After leaving to\
  \ change out of his work clothes, he eagerly pronounces, \u201CLet\u2019s go!\u201D\
  \ As the cafe disappears behind us I learn his name is Ervin & originally from Albania,\
  \ though he\u2019s been living in Athens the last 12 years.We stroll a brick pedestrian\
  \ avenue lined with trees & kiosks till it dead-ends into the bustling 8 lane thoroughfare\
  \ that separates us from the entrance.Waiting for the light to change he admits\
  \ he\u2019s yet to take in these sights. \u201CPerfect! It\u2019ll be new to both\
  \ of us.\u201D Not having a pre-purchased ticket like myself, Ervin speaks to the\
  \ guard in Greek, who then waves him through.\u201CThe perks of being a local,\u201D\
  \ I sigh as I shake my head & tell him that would never work in the U.S. He laughs\
  \ good-naturedly as we stroll the gravel path around the remaining columns.He also\
  \ urges me to step over the waist high rope that surrounds the entire structure,\
  \ which garners a fiercely blown whistle in my direction.The guard keeping a watchful\
  \ eye for just such violators.Again Ervin laughs, a throaty, clean chuckle, while\
  \ I admonish him for turning me into a rule breaker.\u201CWould you like to see\
  \ the Olympic Stadium?\u201D He explains it\u2019s not a far drive but I pause &\
  \ the phrase \u201Cnever go to a second location\u201D lands heavy in my mind. I\
  \ blurt, \u201CI don\u2019t want to be murdered. Are you going to murder me?\u201D\
  \ Managing to look equal parts surprised & insulted, he insists, \u201CI don\u2019\
  t want to murder anyone.Why would you think that?\u201D He\u2019s gesturing to the\
  \ tiny rollerskate of an automobile nearby. A Smart Car.Nobody gets abducted in\
  \ a Smart Car; they don\u2019t even have trunks! Within moments we\u2019re zipping\
  \ up, down & around the curving sprawl of Athens.Not having anywhere to be or companion\
  \ I need to confer with has me feeling adventurous & relishing my independence."
