Text: "Some of the best interludes in life manufacture themselves thousands of miles\
  \ away from your cosy nest ,in the midst of people you may have just met from an\
  \ alien land , and when you least expect it. One is truly blessed when these events\
  \ conspire to fall into place nonchalantly through pure serendipity.\n\nOslo ,Norway.\
  \ Aboard a train that would take me to Bergen via (arguably) the most scenic rail\
  \ route in the world, I could not help but feel that  I was planning my own  heist.\
  \ A heist that would help me accrue memories I would dip into at my leisure as long\
  \ as my neurons would let me remember my name. Moreover, I was slated to meet the\
  \ Bonnie to my Clyde - a soul whose passion for devouring scenery captured my attention.\n\
  \nOur destination - Trolltunga - a rock jutting over a fjord amid the raw glory\
  \ of sheer cliffs and blue valleys. This vista must have inspired the imagination\
  \ behind its name - Troll's tongue.  Our first out-of-plan move - a leisurely lunch\
  \ of exquisite seafood in the Bergen fishmarket after a fjord cruise to Monstraumen.\
  \ Our itinerary bid us goodbye as the last bus to our next port of call left without\
  \ us. \n\nThe melancholy in our eyes soon got replaced with the glint of adventure.\
  \ We managed to chart a route that was feasible,  but tight. A bus ride and a ferry\
  \ ride later, as the summer light decided to mellow towards slumber, we reached\
  \ Rosendal - one hop away from our troll. Rosendal,  a stop we did not foresee,\
  \ became one we cherished for its deep blue fjords and charming town. Yet, the troll\
  \ beckoned.\n\nAs we struggled to find transport late on a national holiday, we\
  \ wandered into an inn that was revelling in matrimony. Not only did the cheery\
  \ bunch help arrange for transport, but we also received a crash course in best\
  \ practises on conquering the troll. From folklore to flora, weather indicators\
  \ to routes - a treasure trove of information that landed in our lap without being\
  \ sought.\n\nWe reached the family who was hosting us at the base camp just past\
  \ midnight. With an arduous trek before us, we needed to top up supplies. Before\
  \ we realised the gravity of our situation, we were summoned to the kitchen and\
  \ handed whole wheat sandwiches for then and later while hearing about the Norwegian\
  \ pastime of 'cabin walking' .\n\nMeticulous plans aside, an unexpected sequence\
  \ of fortunate events helped us attained our treasure.That evening an Indian guy\
  \ held a Malaysian girl's hand atop a Norwegian troll's tongue with a view fit for\
  \ a god ."
