Text: "Maybe it happens more often than some would like to admit. You will tell yourself\
  \ that you were just experimenting, that the things you did don't define you. Now\
  \ that you're home, you've returned to living life as your normal self. Whatever\
  \ your reason for studying abroad, if you were one of the ones who made it away\
  \ from your bubble of American friends, didn\u2019t visit the same bars and clubs\
  \ every night, allowed your heart to be open, to adventure, to love, I commend you.\n\
  I\u2019m not sure why so many think they know themselves before going abroad. I\
  \ think the decisions you make while you\u2019re away from home and those who keep\
  \ you in your comfort zone says a lot about you. I wasn\u2019t afraid of those choices\
  \ or potential decisions. I was pretty open to everything unexpected except for\
  \ one. That's the interesting thing in being away, you're forced to face the things\
  \ you're least open to and maybe some will run, like they'd been running while they\
  \ were at home, like I'd been running. \nWe first met on a night a friend had convinced\
  \ me not to go home for dinner. We sat on a stoop in front of a building for a while,\
  \ the two of them talking as I remained mostly quiet. First impressions: she was\
  \ funny, cute, had an adorable accent and knew English better than I knew Spanish.\
  \ We walked around Chueca, weaving through the sea of people that were out, clearly\
  \ searching for the best party scene they could find. I eventually got food and\
  \ we soon found ourselves too at one club and then another. I was not yet comfortable\
  \ with losing myself on the dance floor, but they both were and I admired it. At\
  \ some point in the night, I began to feel a nervousness take over, and I knew then,\
  \ I couldn\u2019t allow myself to stare at her for too long. \nThe weeks went on\
  \ and we found ourselves occasionally meeting for coffee alone and in small group\
  \ hangouts. Conversations were had, the kinds that make you realize you're not doing\
  \ enough with your life, the ones that make you think you should be reexamining\
  \ different aspects of yourself. Soon enough my time was coming to an end, and well,\
  \ her and I, I expected us to remain friends, until our last night out. We were\
  \ out dancing with friends when she told me she thought I was pretty. I told her\
  \ she made me nervous. She told me she wanted to kiss me, I told her I'd never done\
  \ it before. We stood outside the club on the street corner a while. We kissed.\
  \ That night I stopped running and I began learning about the part of myself I was\
  \ trying to hide away."
