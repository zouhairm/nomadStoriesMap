Text: "When we stopped at the San Ignacio border, I knew there would be trouble. Not\
  \ because we were carrying drugs or guns or doing anything wrong, we're not stupid,\
  \ but because of how they looked at my wife. The car was old and falling apart.\
  \ We'd crossed Belize heading for Tikal, once the capital of the Mayan civilization,\
  \ now a remote ruin. Two boys in uniform guarded the border. One motioned with his\
  \ gun barrel to park and go into the metal-roofed-barn. \u201CWe have a problem,\
  \ there's no serial number on the rental car contract.\u201D I went out to the car\
  \ to find the 12-digit number had been keyed. She read the number to the official\
  \ who wrote it on a tiny piece of paper. The dictation finished, he called one of\
  \ the guards over. They went out the door. \u201CI couldn\u2019t really read the\
  \ number. Somebody tried to scratch it off.\u201D \u201CIs that the right number?\u201D\
  \ \u201CI don\u2019t know.\u201D\u201CRelax.\u201D My wife told me. \u201CLet me\
  \ talk. He likes me.\" \u201CWhat did you talk about?\u201D\u201CBarcelona. Tapas\u201D\
  \u201CFlirting?\u201D\u201CAggressively.\u201DHe entered the room with two armed\
  \ guards. \u201CEres un mentiroso!\u201D\u201CHe said you were a liar.\u201D\u201C\
  I know.\u201CAsk him if we can pay a fine\u201D.\u201CHe said no. Said he wasn\u2019\
  t that type of man.\u201D\u201CAsk him if we can use the phone.\u201D\u201CDown\
  \ the street over the border.\u201D We entered a shack. Fone. Fax. Fish. We bought\
  \ two beers, ordered fried fish and my wife called the Mexican car rental company.\
  \ The fish arrived, rice, beans, more beer and eventually the fax. \u201CWhere are\
  \ the women in this town?\u201D My wife asked. \u201CNo children either.\u201D\u201C\
  Creepy.\u201D\u201CI just want to get out of here.\u201D The car was gone. The official\
  \ was also gone. \u201CHe went to lunch, took the car. They say he will return.\u201D\
  \u201CWhen?\u201D\u201CWhenever he wants. He\u2019s the guy with the gun.\" Close\
  \ to midnight, a car engine revved to the max. The official staggered into the barn\
  \ singing. The car smelt like perfume and sperm, but started. As we drove over the\
  \ bridge, I asked, \u201CWhat did he say to you?\u201D\u201CYou worry too much.\u201D\
  \ My wife told me. The next day at Tikal, standing atop a steep temple pyramid that\
  \ turned the rain forest into a blanket, the humid wind drying our sweat, I tried\
  \ to worship like a Mayan. I understood that our greatest fears always come true.\
  \ I thought of taking my wife\u2019s hand and jumping, but wasn\u2019t convinced\
  \ of death. We were high and the ground was far, but a swift and instantaneous death\
  \ is never guaranteed. While she took photographs, I realized despite my best efforts\
  \ I still had no inkling how to pray."
