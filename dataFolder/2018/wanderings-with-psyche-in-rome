Text: "Hallowed ground, a most unexpected encounter with God, & something visceral\
  \ within let out an ecstatic sigh. \n\nIn a city where antiquity quietly bows to\
  \ the brash rush of modernity & each consecutive era indelibly leaves its mark,\
  \ Rome both challenges & awes. This is not the reminiscence of a famous landmark,\
  \ first time visitors will naturally gravitate to the Vatican City & Colosseum without\
  \ my help. No, dear traveller. This is about a transcendental moment experienced\
  \ in the most unlikely of places, a moment that pierces to the heart of why we,\
  \ intrepid adventurers, travel.\n  \nAn overcast January day that is, thankfully,\
  \ rain free. A jostling group of Art History students murmur their way around the\
  \ Cimitero Acattolico di Roma, admiring historic significance. Final resting place\
  \ for Percy Bysshe Shelley & John Keats, the cemetery boasts an enviable reputation\
  \ of dead people. Having already wandered around the beautifully simplistic plaque\
  \ of Shelley & marvelled at the haphazard beauty of the decaying tombstones, I came\
  \ to stand enraptured in front of William Wetmore Story's \u2018Weeping Angel\u2019\
  . Homage to his wife, this statue is love incarnate. With majestic wings encapsulating\
  \ the grief-stricken body of the angel & tomb, the human emotion evoked is disconcerting.\
  \ \n\nFeeling sentimental, I detach from the group to breathe deeply of the crisp\
  \ air & take an appreciative moment. Weaving between the now tightly-packed tombstones,\
  \ a large squat crypt caught my eye. Covered in relatively unimpressive relief work\
  \ around the more prominent sides, further inspection revealed a door & steps. Interest\
  \ piqued, I descended into the Andersen sepulchre. Words are inadequate to describe\
  \ the sensation of calm, homecoming, and vertigo that overwhelmed my senses. Dust\
  \ motes floated, the entire cavern faintly shimmered with luminescent turquoise\
  \ mosaics and the air was heavy, somnambulant. \u2018Let me just rest here\u2019\
  \ something primal whispered. Looking around at the beautiful mosaics, the hard-packed\
  \ earth floor, the tombs, the sculptures, I felt privileged & blessed to have inadvertently\
  \ stumbled across a place I knew would forever haunt my subconscious. On the other\
  \ side of the world to family & home, I felt something universal caress my soul\
  \ & remind me that only when we do this, when we extend our horizons, explore the\
  \ unknown, and open ourselves to experience, that we truly reconnect with who we\
  \ are. \n\nThis is both my challenge and invitation to you, dear traveller."
