Text: "Passport control was a memorable experience as the airport was military controlled.\
  \ All soldiers carried some sort of weapon that could quite easily take my last\
  \ breath. Militant stance, movement, speech, expression \u2013 almost as if they\
  \ weren\u2019t allowed to be human let alone giveaway their individuality. There\
  \ was recognisably a lack of design in this airport. Beige floor tiles, dim lighting,\
  \ concrete walls, the odd plastic plant, sheer vast space and breathing through\
  \ the humidity transported me back inside the carriages of London tubes.  \n\nA\
  \ pair of sunglasses fell from the moving conveyor belt onto the floor. A soldier\
  \ lifts up the sunglasses and whistles until my ears rattled like a snake and my\
  \ heart left my chest. I frantically move towards him. I couldn\u2019t speak Arabic\
  \ but my big bulging brown eyes read \u201Cplease don\u2019t yell at me Sir\u201D\
  . He made me feel guilty for my lack of attention. The solider murmured something\
  \ of course I couldn\u2019t grasp, but I politely said thank you, took my glasses\
  \ and continued moving. \n\n\u201CWhere are you from Sir?\u2019\u2019 \n\u201CUK,\
  \ Wales\u201D replies dad proudly. \n\u201CNo, where are you from?\nI wanted dad\
  \ to just give them the answer they wanted to hear to explain why we\u2019re darker\
  \ skinned despite our British accents. \n\u201CUK, but my parents are from Bangladesh\u201D\
  . \n\n\u201CI understand\u201D. This soldier was going through IDs slowly matching\
  \ our real faces to them and notices \u201CMohammed\u201D on dad\u2019s passport.\
  \ \n\u201CAhh, Assalamulaikum\u201D he muttered immediately and respectively through\
  \ raised eyebrows and a mediocre half-smile realising that he had shared a common\
  \ ground with us all along as dad was religious too.   \n\n\u201CWe hope you enjoy.\
  \ Please any questions, we welcome you\u201D His sharp kindness and total U-turn\
  \ in his personality was unexpected after the awkward encounter and glares from\
  \ the military earlier.  It\u2019s common to believe that we\u2019re all too different\
  \ through language, media, societal and political barriers.  Travelling from a young\
  \ age has made me embrace these barriers and try to connect with the world and the\
  \ beautiful people in it. I walked into Egypt care-free never considering it would\
  \ be my last opportunity. \n\nToday, Sharm El Sheik is just as deserted as its popular\
  \ Mount Sinai. The \u2018pearl of the Red Sea\u2019 has lost its jewel like luster.\
  \ The FCO strongly advises against travel, direct flights are banned from the UK\
  \ and the once ever enthusiastic Thomas Cook has removed Sharm El Sheikh from their\
  \ holiday programs, cancelling their weekly flights."
