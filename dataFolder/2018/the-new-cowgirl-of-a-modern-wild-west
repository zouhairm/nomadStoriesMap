Text: "She was black chrome metal fueled by a piston heart. A sturdy breed. She was\
  \ Rhonda - my Honda Civic. At a gas station on the outskirts of Atlanta, I fueled\
  \ her up for our journey ahead. \n\nWith the proper preparation, research, and understanding\
  \ of my parents, I finally embarked on a new lifestyle - to live out of my four-door\
  \ sedan. It wouldn\u2019t be easy, but being pushed to the edge is when one truly\
  \ lives.\n\nMarch was ending bringing a new season, a new moon, a new beginning.\
  \ As I fueled her up at the station, I closed my eyes and felt a lightness \u2013\
  \ maybe it was the diesel in the air or maybe it was the quiet excitement of knowing\
  \ I owned the day. I looked up at the noon sun and it burned gold with possibilities.\
  \ After a glance at my map and a crank of a key, I was bound for North Carolina\u2019\
  s town of Cherokee. \n\nAll around me were my comrades of the road. Modern day merchant\
  \ men hauling their wagons along silk roads. About a hundred miles north, the highways\
  \ began to bend mimicking the shape of water. I pulled off highway 441 and arrived\
  \ at the ancient Victorian town of Tallulah, Georgia. Suspended a thousand feet\
  \ above a cascading gorge, I was staring down at Hurricane Falls \u2013 one of six\
  \ waterfalls inside Tallulah Falls State Park. The water pounded like the drumbeat\
  \ in my heart and my faith fluttered much like the bridge I was suspended on.\n\n\
  Smoke began to linger. An air of mystery surrounded Cherokee. Cabins sat along the\
  \ Oconaluftee River and water rippled a quiet hum. Time stopped. I felt nostalgia\
  \ for the old west as I passed a wood cabin of a gem mine and a casino where rugged\
  \ gamblers sat at poker tables. The rich culture of the natives lived downtown.\
  \ Artisan and leather shops mingled with fudge and ice cream parlors. The locals\
  \ chanted ancient stories in street dramas. I felt like a lost cowgirl being welcomed\
  \ into the tribe.\n\nAs dusk was arriving, I took a ride through the Smoky Mountains\
  \ National Park. I pulled off at Clingman\u2019s Observation Tower and looked out\
  \ at all the roads woven within the mountains. I thought about my life. At this\
  \ moment, it was just me and my gallant steed of a car. Today was just the beginning\
  \ of a lifestyle of travel that would last for five months (I knew I couldn\u2019\
  t last once winter arrived). \n\nOnward I went in search of distant pastures\u2026\
  \ Whether it be the rolling shores of the coast, the rigid valleys of the mountains,\
  \ the neon lights of the city. I keep asking myself, \u201CWhich pastures do you\
  \ seek, young nomad?\u201D"
