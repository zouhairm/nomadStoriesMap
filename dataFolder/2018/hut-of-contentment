Text: "The canopy of the vast blue sky within the compass of mighty hills around,\
  \ could not have looked more like a \u2018canvas of joy\u2019 as it appeared on\
  \ the day of my arrival to the little hilly village of 'Ponta'in the state of Himachal\
  \ Pradesh which is located in the lap of Himalayas.The way which I traveled to reach\
  \ this place was a random shift from hair-raising steep hilly roads to gushing rivers\
  \ &numerous bridges.There were new as well as old type of houses in the village\
  \ which were spread amid the terraced fields &near to the road.The old houses were\
  \ constructed on the local-architectural technique of 'KATH-KHUNI' which consisted\
  \ of two floors, lower one for animals &the upper one for living or storage.These\
  \ houses were hut shaped,made of baked bricks &had slate brick roofs .The moon shined\
  \ brightly as I sat in the courtyard beside a bonfire to shield myself from the\
  \ freezing cold&chatting with the locals about rustic life.As the conversations\
  \ took the life of their own in my head,there came an old lady carrying a bag of\
  \ fodder for the animals ,she had a humble smile on her face.She wore a traditional\
  \ dress which consisted of kameez(a long shirt) &salwar (trouser)& dupatta (kind\
  \ of scarf) with which she covered her head &wore a few silver ornaments.I greeted\
  \ her with the Indian gesture of folded hands together speaking,'NAMASTE',she reciprocated\
  \ my greeting by raising the flat of her hands in benediction.Sooner the conversation\
  \ drifted towards the inescapable touch of technology which has transformed the\
  \ world into a global village & suddenly a very strange fact came forward that made\
  \ the existence of the old lady in front of my eyes quite unbelievable that in a\
  \ world of networking there was this lady who didn't even have an electricity connection\
  \ in her house since years. When I asked her about it,she answered that she never\
  \ felt the need of it and it made no difference.She lived like that out of choice\
  \ as I was informed that she resided in an old type of house near the road with\
  \ her husband &their whole family lived in a nearby village which they seldom visited.They\
  \ reared animals,grew crops &lived a life of pure contentment in the bosom of nature.Before\
  \ I left,I saw the old lady's house it became an'emblem of contentment'for me.Till\
  \ today, this experience has saved me from dire aftermath as it ushered me back\
  \ every time from ignorance to wisdom,greed to contentment &fear to courage to live\
  \ a well lived life than one lost in the wilderness of dynamic world."
