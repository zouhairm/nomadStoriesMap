Text: "The dirt road ended at a flat, open area surrounded by evergreens. I parked\
  \ my truck beside a grey sedan, the only other vehicle in the lot. I had arrived\
  \ at Blue Point Amethyst Mine in Pearl, Ontario. \nI looked around. A rusty school\
  \ bus was permanently parked in the corner of the lot, and to my right stood a wooden\
  \ shack. On the table out front, fist-sized purple amethyst samples caught the sunlight.\
  \ \nThe parking lot was eerily quiet. \nI walked over to the shack where a hand-written\
  \ note on the table read \"please come up to the mine to the left of the bus.\"\
  \ \nI hiked the path up to a hole big enough to swallow a small house. Bright orange\
  \ construction barriers encircled it, clouds of grey dust spewed out of it. A high-pitched\
  \ grinding sound pierced the silence. \nI stopped and looked around for the amethyst\
  \ mine. \nThen I realized the hole was the mine. \nI got closer and peered down.\
  \ Ribbons of purple amethyst wound through the grey rock. \nThe only other person\
  \ around was the one working down in the mine. \nI turned to walk back when I heard\
  \ someone say \"Hello!\" A man walked towards me, the sticker on his white hardhat\
  \ proclaiming \"Blue Point Amethyst Mine\". I noticed the noisy machine had stopped.\
  \ \nMiner-Man (as I thought of him) was in his mid-fifties. His belly hung over\
  \ his belt, and salt and pepper whiskers bristled from his jowly chin. He spoke\
  \ slowly with a soft voice and blinked a lot. \nWas I interested in the mine? he\
  \ asked. I said yes.\nOnce he got talking, he didn't stop. My questions were either\
  \ ignored or interrupted by random facts about amethyst and notable events from\
  \ the mine's history (which weren't delivered in any kind of chronological order).\
  \ \nFrom what I could piece together, the story of Blue Point Amethyst Mine was\
  \ a love story. Miner-Man had visited Northern Ontario years ago to collect amethyst\
  \ and returned to Blue Point Mine year after year. When the owner decided to sell,\
  \ he realized he loved the mine (and amethyst) so much he needed to buy it. \nI\
  \ was filled with a mix of respect and head-shaking awe at Miner-Man's commitment\
  \ to his hobby. I turned, thanking the eccentric old miner for his time, and wishing\
  \ him the best. \nAs I bumped along the dirt road towards the highway, I felt like\
  \ I was forgetting something. \nSuddenly I realized what it was. Miner-Man had told\
  \ me about everything he considered important \u2013 the mine, its history, his\
  \ life, and how he came to own it. \nBut he had completely forgotten to tell me\
  \ his name."
