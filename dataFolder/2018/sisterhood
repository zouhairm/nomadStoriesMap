Text: "The Tsum Valley is a bone-jarring day\u2019s jeep ride from Kathmandu, followed\
  \ by four days trekking the Manaslu Circuit.  Then you turn right.\n\nImmediately\
  \ the foot traffic drops off.  It is quieter, calmer.  The path rises high above\
  \ the river; pine trees cover the slopes interspersed with rhododendrons in bloom.\
  \  This a place where distance is measured in days walked and time is dished up\
  \ in dollops of daylight.  When it\u2019s dark, it\u2019s dark. \n\nI gasp as we\
  \ clear the treeline.  I am used to mountains, but these are in a different league.\
  \  Looking at them, words fail me; I stumble through clich\xE9s and into silence.\
  \ \n\nThe warning cry of \u201Csafe side!\u201D rings out. The path is narrow and\
  \ heavily laden donkeys don\u2019t give way.  The smell of dung and sweat hang in\
  \ the air. A man and his son approach.  They both wear headband slung baskets, the\
  \ son\u2019s is in miniature. Usually for load bearing, they also serve as a chicken\
  \ house when upturned, and occasionally as a Nepali stretcher.\n\nIn the distance,\
  \ stone houses cluster around the main path.  A few startlingly blue post-earthquake\
  \ roofs break up the traditional slabs of grey slate.  Every pocket of arable land\
  \ is crammed with vegetables, while further out fields sway with grain. \n\nA group\
  \ of old Tibetan women approach.  Dressed in dark colours to the ankle, they move\
  \ with graceful economy that speaks of a lifetime of hard work.  They have weather\
  \ beaten faces and eyes bright with curiosity and resilience. Their chattering is\
  \ raised a notch at the sight of our all-female group; further still as they recognise\
  \ and mime our \u2018same faces\u2019.  They grab my forearms with strength and\
  \ joy, their delight palpable.  My ten-year-old granddaughter is seized, engulfed\
  \ in a hug, then passed along the line.  There is a chorus of \u201CAma?\u201D \
  \ I mime, claiming my two daughters. One of them indicates her daughter; we are\
  \ three generations spanning a fifty-year age bracket.   The chattering continues\
  \ as each side inspects the other.  Our guide has long since rolled his eyes and\
  \ wandered off, for this exchange is repeated many times during the trek. \n\nThese\
  \ women live in a world restricted by how far they can walk.  Apart from rice, if\
  \ they can\u2019t grow it, they don\u2019t eat it. Their lives are as different\
  \ from mine as it\u2019s possible to get.   We have no language in common.  And\
  \ yet there is a connection that is so easily made, and it is, repeatedly \u2013\
  \ the strength of women and the love of family. I go home humbled by them."
