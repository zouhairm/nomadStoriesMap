Text: "\u201CSee Positano's Stations of The Cross on Good Friday. They\u2019re famous!\u201D\
  \ urged a Canadian tourist on the SITA bus from Sorrento. Everything pointed me\
  \ there: a wall-poster; my waiter in a cafe; now this.\nIntrigued, I headed up to\
  \ Chiesa Nuova, the hill-top church; starting point for this long-celebrated Easter\
  \ tradition. No need to check directions, just follow the crowd, assured of the\
  \ right way.\nCostumed men and excited children milled around for the start. A family\
  \ of mother, daughter, granddaughter smiled me a welcome. My limited Italian and\
  \ the older women\u2019s lack of English, prompted the teenage granddaughter to\
  \ haltingly explain. \u201CIt is an honour to have a part in the parade. All the\
  \ men and children want to join.\u201D They kindly shared program sheets so I could\
  \ follow.\nI was familiar with the symbols the children carried - hammer and nails,\
  \ crown of thorns, even a rooster and I recognised the Roman soldiers. I was mystified\
  \ by the hooded red or white costumes that bore a shocking resemblance to a KKK\
  \ outfit - I\u2019ve since learnt it's a medieval costume.\nShortly, the Parish\
  \ Priest commenced the ceremony. He led prayers at each \u2018station\u2019 and\
  \ through Positano's narrow streets and laneways, he led various refrains. My new\
  \ friends encouraged me, indicating the place in the program.\nWe wound our way\
  \ down through town, cramming into tiny walkways. Ahead, I could see the helmeted,\
  \ spear-carrying centurions and always leading the procession was The Cross, carried\
  \ by a rotation of proud youths. Workers at worksites, shopkeepers and customers\
  \ all stopped respectfully. \nEach station commemorated an incident in Christ\u2019\
  s journey to Calvary. Several were churches and in one, the altar was the Garden\
  \ of Gethsemane where Jesus prayed. I was invited to read a prayer but am ashamed\
  \ to admit I declined the invitation, thinking my fumbling Italian would spoil the\
  \ occasion. I realise now that my participation would not be judged, but warmly\
  \ welcomed. Given a similar opportunity, I'd not refuse.\nRounding corners, our\
  \ walking efforts were rewarded with sparkling vistas along the Amalfi Coast. An\
  \ hour in, we reached the beach.  \nOur trek ended in the magnificent, tile-domed\
  \ Chiesa de Santa Maria Assunta. Jesus and the Cross were set up for the final crucifixion\
  \ scene. One small hiccup caused smiles all around, with the figure of Jesus hanging\
  \ by one hand \u2013 back down for a quick repair job then the Parish Priest brought\
  \ the ceremony to a solemn close.\nWhat a Buone Natale."
