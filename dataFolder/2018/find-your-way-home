Text: "Still several hours before noon, the air was warm and humid. The small Portuguese\
  \ caf\xE9 was barely occupied. My left hand was attached to a bottle of Heineken,\
  \ and the other was flipping ashes off a perpetually lit cigarette. Sitting across\
  \ from me, with a very concerned and stern look on his face, was the Captain of\
  \ The Hula. The turmoil I felt was perhaps just vaguely relieved by the second,\
  \ or was it third, bottle of beer.  More was needed. My face was swollen and red\
  \ from the tears that relentlessly poured from my eyes. \nI had come all this way\
  \ and spent all this time only to be faced with a decision, one which I already\
  \ knew, would have to hurt someone. A lose-lose situation. I so desperately hoped\
  \ for a win-win. Why couldn\u2019t there have been a win-win that day?\nFour hundred\
  \ miles off the western coast of Africa, this was the very last possible group of\
  \ islands at which to stop before heading west to cross the Atlantic Ocean for the\
  \ Caribbean. If only my Captain hadn\u2019t decided to make this stop. I prayed\
  \ he would keep going. I had known if he stopped, I would be unable to keep my promise\
  \ to my children to be home by Christmas Eve, and my promise to him to sail across\
  \ the Atlantic as crew. \nAs we motored into the archipelago very early in the morning,\
  \ the feeling of desperation hugged the ship, and her crew, just as intensely as\
  \ the fog was clinging to the water. The ragged features of terrain pushed randomly\
  \ out of an entirely too still sea.  It was as if my internal turmoil had spilled\
  \ out and could be felt by all of nature. \nIt didn\u2019t matter how far I had\
  \ come, it didn\u2019t matter that my Captain could not pick up crew in Cape Verde,\
  \ or that his insurer would not cover him without three people on board. All that\
  \ mattered was that I kept my promise to the most precious beings in my life. Nonetheless,\
  \ I needed to hear from a higher power that this was the right course of action.\
  \ My practice for this whole year traveling had been about releasing my control\
  \ of the outcome and allowing the Universe to guide me. \nI am always amazed at\
  \ how the Universe shows up and always grateful. My Captain was more loving and\
  \ sensitive than I had ever witnessed. He let me know I could go, and he would be\
  \ fine_even though I knew he wouldn\u2019t be. The relief brought more tears. And\
  \ then, the most distinct sign I have ever received from the Universe came to me.\
  \  In that small Portuguese caf\xE9, a song came on the radio in a clear British\
  \ voice and said to me, \u201Cfind your way home\u201D."
