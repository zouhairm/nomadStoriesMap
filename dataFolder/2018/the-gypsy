Text: "Her skin had grooves like bark on the body of a tree. Every step calculated.\
  \ Every breath planned.\n\nShe wore a brown fur coat three times the size of her\
  \ frail body. When she went to remove it, I stood up from my seat to help her.\n\
  \nShe sat by me. I held her purse. She struggled with the airplane table. I pulled\
  \ it down for her. She wrestled with her belongings clenching her coat tight like\
  \ a child does her blanket.\n\nAs the plane took off, she grabbed my forearm telling\
  \ me how scared she was because she hadn\u2019t been on a plane in over 60 years.\
  \ I assured her everything would be okay and if she needed me, I\u2019d be there\
  \ for her.\n\nI looked her in her eyes. Deep blue. It was almost as if in that moment\
  \ I dove into the depths of her eyes and her soul came out to hug mine. I asked\
  \ her like I do anyone who touches my soul in the warmest ways:\n\n\u201CYou\u2019\
  ve got a beautiful soul, what\u2019s your story?\u201D\n\nShe smiled letting out\
  \ a tiny laugh. She paused as if her mind ran through all the things she could\u2019\
  ve told me remembering her life from birth til\u2019 this moment. It was only a\
  \ couple seconds, but her face flashed every emotion imaginable. She turned to me.\n\
  \n\u201CI\u2019m a gypsy.\u201D\n\n\u201CA gypsy? Tell me more.\u201D\n\nShe went\
  \ on with stories about how she grew up on the islands when there were more locals\
  \ than there was money. She told me how she left the islands when she was 20 and\
  \ never returned until now. She told me how she got sick of her job and decided\
  \ to become a gypsy and backpacked the states to find herself.\n\nThe more she talked,\
  \ the more I understood the story ingrained in her skin. The history of a gypsy\
  \ rooted in life. She had been opening up revealing deep personal things about her\
  \ life when she stopped as the pilot came over the intercom.\n\nHe notified the\
  \ passengers about our descend. 5 hours had gone by and I forgot we were flying.\n\
  \n\u201CHow's that for a quick plane ride. I bet your ears are bleeding.\u201D She\
  \ said.\n\nI laughed. The sound of the plane filled the silence between us. I struggled\
  \ to find the right words to continue where we left off.\n\nShe was looking forward\
  \ when out of the silence she said, \u201CLife\u2019s weird like that. You suffer\
  \ and worry about the smallest things then one day you get old and die. Why worry?\
  \ Why keep toxic people in your life? Bad people should stick with bad people and\
  \ kind souls should stick with kind souls.\u201D\n\nWe got off the plane and embraced\
  \ each other. The last thing she said to me was, \u201CThank you. No one ever listens\
  \ anymore. Please stay kind my dear.\u201D"
