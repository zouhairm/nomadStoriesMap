Text: "It started with some friends, just another camping trip. No one in my group\
  \ had been to the camp before, and we had to hike about four miles to get into the\
  \ campsite. We all figured we could do this fairly quickly and  decided to leave\
  \ a little later in the day then we probably should have, but we were kids, we were\
  \ invincible. We started our hike and one of the kids in our group is an asthmatic,\
  \ so I decided to keep back with him and let the other part of our group keep going\
  \ on at their pace to set up camp and a fire for us when we got there. We kept hiking\
  \ and noticed that the \u201Ctrail\u201D we were hiking in was starting to get a\
  \ little overgrown but we didn\u2019t mind, we weren\u2019t going to let some plants\
  \ get in our way of a good time. After about an hour, I could find any signs stating\
  \ that we were even close to the trail. At that moment we had to make a choice,\
  \ to stay there and hope someone could find us, or push back to where we can see\
  \ landmarks on our map. We decided to push through the dense mountainous forest\
  \ terrain, up to the foreboding mountain peak above us, hoping we could see the\
  \ trail again. As we began hiking again, the elevation changes began to affect my\
  \ buddy, difficulty breathing and headaches hit us both like pounds of bricks. Trying\
  \ my best to push through it, I took his backpack and strapped it to the front of\
  \ me. Having an extra 60 lbs taken off from him he was able to keep going. As we\
  \ pushed through we could see a clearing in the trees due to our new vantage point.\
  \ We stopped to look at the map and decided that it must be the lake we were supposed\
  \ to be camping by now. As we decided that we were going to hike down to that we\
  \ hoped with all certainty that it was the lake, as the sun was beginning to dim.\
  \ As the clearing became closer and closer we began to hear the sound of water running,\
  \ we ran to it. We began to follow the river, unbeknownst that the trail was opposite\
  \ us. I wanted to collapse as we kept walking on the rocky surface of this riverbed,\
  \ but kept going with the hope that the lake would be just ahead. The same thought\
  \ kept going through my head, \u201CThis isn\u2019t it, just stop. You\u2019re not\
  \ going to make it.\u201D As if my friend could read my thoughts, he turned to me\
  \ and said, \u201CThis is it! We\u2019re almost there! Just a little farther!\u201D\
  \ With this new motivation we both pushed on, we began circling the lake and began\
  \ circling the lake. We saw a camp and ran as fast as we could, we found them. Welcomed\
  \ with hugs and cheers, we had made it."
