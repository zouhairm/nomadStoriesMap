Text: "The minute I walked into the Agra train station, resolved to buy my own ticket\
  \ to Delhi, I knew it was a mistake.  The lines of Indian men pushing and cutting\
  \ from the front scared me.  I was the only woman or foreigner there.  Why was it\
  \ so important to learn to negotiate this aspect of the Indian train system?\n A\
  \ man offered to buy my ticket and take me to the train.  Relieved, I accepted.\n\
  As we entered the car, I realized I was in lowest class car.  The benches were filled;\
  \ the floor was strewn with trash, food, and children.  As more people packed in\
  \ at each stop, the heat mixed with the outside temperature to make the sweltering\
  \ car stifling.  I was the lone foreign woman, the object of stares.  I asked my\
  \ guide when to get off.  No answer or eye contact.  Then he exited.\n The train\
  \ stopped and everyone shoved their way out.  An older man seized my arm, grabbed\
  \ my bag, and pulled me to the door.  He pointed to the track four feet below, motioned\
  \ to jump, scamper across and back up the other side.  He helped me down, threw\
  \ my pack onto the other platform, and hauled me up.  Then he parted.  I was alone,\
  \ wandering the platform, asking how to get to Delhi, meeting blank stares and shrugs.\
  \  \n I had just read an essay about the thousands of Indian children separated\
  \ from their parents each year.  Their fate was riding the rails, begging for a\
  \ living, and eventually landing in Howrah Station in Calcutta, sniffing glue and\
  \ sleeping in the bowels of the station.  Would that be me?\n As I headed up the\
  \ stairs to the pedestrian bridge, a hand reached out and stopped me.  A young fellow\
  \ sitting on the steps interrupted his phone call to say he\u2019d help.  His lips\
  \ reminded me of my brother\u2019s so I trusted him.  When beggars tugged at me,\
  \ he hissed and shooed them of.  Several trains later, he stuck me on a train in\
  \ the ladies\u2019 car.  I arrived in Delhi amidst a whirl of saris, vendors, children,\
  \ noise, and trash.\n That simple act of trying to buy my own ticket opened me to\
  \ unexpected insights.  I did not realize how much I stood out in India till then.\
  \  Nor did it occur to me how na\xEFve I was to accept the offer of help.  I didn\u2019\
  t know if it was miscommunication or malice.  Not that it matters.  What does is\
  \ that people surface and help.  And I learned to butt the line, hold my place,\
  \ shove back, and joke with the men.  I knew I had honed the art the day I pushed\
  \ to the front.  Noticing a group of horrified travelers, I asked if I had butt\
  \ the line.  Yes, I had."
