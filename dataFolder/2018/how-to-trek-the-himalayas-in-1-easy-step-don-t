Text: "My alarm sounded at 3:30am, and I immediately peered through the frosted window\
  \ of our homestay and searched for the stars. A Nepalese guide we met along the\
  \ path the day before told us if we don\u2019t see stars, crawl back into bed and\
  \ enjoy another four hours of rest. As I wiped the condensation from the glass with\
  \ my crumpled fist, a part of me was really hoping to be greeted by a blanket of\
  \ thick grey covering the sky. Instead, it was dotted with thousands of glittering\
  \ sparks screaming at us, \u201Cget up, it\u2019s time to go.\u201D\n\nIt was day\
  \ two of our eleven day, 4,130m, ascent to Annapurna Base Camp. We were hopelessly\
  \ unprepared, unfit, and still drying off after being caught in a lightning storm\
  \ complete with mudslides the day before. Reluctantly we crawled out of bed, put\
  \ on our boots, and headed through the darkness to the foot of the 350m ascent we\
  \ were about to embark on. We weren\u2019t the only ones mad enough to opt for this\
  \ \u2018additional extra\u2019 hike, there were many fellow trekkers trudging up\
  \ the large make-shift stairs of mud and branch, gasping for breath and digging\
  \ in their trekking poles, all in the hopes of reaching a perfect sunrise.\n\nThe\
  \ cold air hit our lungs like a punch to the chest and we heaved oxygen as if it\
  \ were a chore, dragging our legs up and up with our necks straining to see, \u201C\
  is this the last corner?\u201D. We passed the ever-recognisable Nepalese prayer\
  \ flags, taunting us with their bright, happy colours - all I could think was that\
  \ if I was going to make it up this mountain I would need a prayer or two myself.\n\
  \nFinally, after what seemed like an eternity of sleepy, sickening cardio, we reached\
  \ the top of Poonhill Mountain. We were greeted by 360 degree views of the Himalayas,\
  \ frosted by a pink glow as the sun rose up to lift the shadows from the highest\
  \ summits in the world. Suddenly we felt a massive wave of accomplishment and reward\
  \ - this was worth missing out on a couple of hours of sleep.\n\nWe spotted Fishtail\
  \ and Machhapuchhre amongst the towering peaks, as well as the beast of our goal\
  \ destination, Annapurna. It was the first real taste of the roller coaster of pain\
  \ and gratitude that was to come, and the fourth time i\u2019d asked myself that\
  \ day - \u201CCan I do actually this?\""
