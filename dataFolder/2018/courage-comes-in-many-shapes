Text: "Everything was set. The little canoe that I just traded from a local shaman\
  \ was waiting filled with all the supplies, the destination was chosen, and the\
  \ weather was good. Everything was perfect except for one thing. Why did I have\
  \ to meet him on my way? I certainly didn\u2019t need any additional trouble and\
  \ here it was. Wandering in the crowd, whining, ignored by all the passers-by, all\
  \ by himself, condemned to suffering. So fine, I\u2019ll take this little ball of\
  \ yellow fluff with me. On the canoe. Down the Ecuadorian Amazon.\n\nChicken, that\u2019\
  s how I\u2019m going to call him. There is no other name that fits him so well.\
  \ Vagabonding alone in the crowded streets of the Coca city, he had shown an adventurous\
  \ spirit. Probably he broke out from between the bars of some animal store\u2019\
  s breeding cage. Just like I escaped from a life of routine. This made me feel a\
  \ deep connection with my winged companion. I already liked him.\n\nAnd there we\
  \ went, the wooden canoe, the fluffy Chicken and me. The beginnings were not easy.\
  \ I didn't even know what to fuel him with, yet in a tropical jungle you don\u2019\
  t usually find a branded poultry feed. Still very quickly my friend accepted me\
  \ as his mother, so I had no choice \u2013 I just couldn\u2019t leave him to perish.\
  \ We were splitting every meal, spoon to the beak, and my buddy was rapidly increasing\
  \ in size.\n\nGoing down the r\xEDo Napo became much easier thanks to the surprising\
  \ welcome in the indigenous communities of the Kichwa tribe. With time I learned\
  \ that this sympathy wasn\u2019t caused specifically by my good vibe but rather\
  \ by the deep hope of the natives that my Chicken was a food supply.\n\nOften we\
  \ would spend the night on a sandy island exposed by the drop of the water level.\
  \ Sometimes, being in a hurry to set up camp before the nightfall, I would forget\
  \ to bring the fowl from the canoe. But he would never allow me to leave him behind.\
  \ My Chicken, this minuscule, innocent, frail creature, would jump into the river\
  \ and beat its current with his tiny wings on a few meter long escapade to the shore.\
  \ Then he would sit directly by my feet. Just to make sure I remember to put him\
  \ in my tent before sleeping.\n\nI could have thought that I was indispensable to\
  \ him but the truth lies elsewhere. My chirping fellow made me stronger. Why would\
  \ I be afraid of all the boas, jaguars and tarantulas if Chicken wasn\u2019t scared\
  \ of me? I went on this journey to experience the wilderness, still sometimes you\
  \ can find what you\u2019re looking for where you least expect it."
