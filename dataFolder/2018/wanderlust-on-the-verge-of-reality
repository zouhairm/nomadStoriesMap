Text: "And so began the most intricately woven make believe agenda one could ever\
  \ create. We enjoyed each other\u2019s company, and with my fiery and adventurous\
  \ Aries personality, and he being a grounded and calculated Taurus, we agreed that\
  \ we could be decent travel buddies. We both wanted to see Seattle and take in California.\
  \ The West Coast was calling our names.\nBeing that we were in Canada already, we\
  \ figured we could start in British Columbia. The decision had to be made whether\
  \ to hit Tofino in the colder months to experience the winter storms crashing upon\
  \ the shore while huddled warm in a chalet with fresh lattes, or to indulge in the\
  \ large surfing waves of the summer and the tree house like tents where the oceans\
  \ lullaby is heard the entire time one lies in bed. I eagerly searched every Tofino\
  \ business on Instagram and began following them. Every picture- the ocean, the\
  \ beach, a cold beer from the brewery, a melty icecream cone from the local shop-\
  \ earned a Like. I could not stop fantasizing about Tofino.\nOur trip had only begun\
  \ \u2013 we couldn\u2019t miss Vancouver! We added the city to our \u2018must see\u2019\
  \ list, along with another mainland city where our buddy lived. One should never\
  \ miss the opportunity to visit friends if they are within such close proximity.\
  \ Friendships are special and must be maintained for them to grow and withstand\
  \ the crash of time and distance. \nMy favourite text:\nB: This sounds amazing if\
  \ it ever happens.\nZ: You mean WHEN it happens.\nBut alas! Recall this is only\
  \ make believe. A dream cultivated by two people that had enough breath and heartbeat\
  \ of it\u2019s own that one could believe it to be reality. Summer ended. Zach returned\
  \ to college. I remained here.  \nMy diary was filled with a trip so detailed one\
  \ would assume I had already gone. My diary also held woe of a friendship softened\
  \ by time and distance \u2013 two factors I spoke of previously. I grieved the death\
  \ of those conversations. I ached for the weakened companionship. However, to travel\
  \ often requires just a bit more money than I tend to accumulate in that fund. Boom\
  \ \u2013 impulsive Aries idea \u2013 I need a side hustle. \nToday, the sign fell\
  \ right into my lap. \nI have decided to take the plunge, to submit an application,\
  \ to put my English minor to the test, and allow my desire to travel and immerse\
  \ myself in cultures and places take the lead. I am at the end, or the \u2018edge\u2019\
  \ if you will, and hoping that my leap lands me in Argentina."
