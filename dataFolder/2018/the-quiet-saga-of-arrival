Text: "The crags and cliffs are barely discernible against the pre-dawn sky as the\
  \ night ferry from the Faroe Island comes within a deathly swim of Iceland\u2019\
  s North West coast.  \n\nAs the sun rises the cliffs take shape like a photograph,\
  \ part chemically, part alchemically, slowly shifting from two to three dimensions.\
  \ \n\nBy the time the Smyril Line wedges itself in the narrowest point of fjord,\
  \ Iceland is real. Powerful. Muscular. Complex.\n\nWe think of travel as a series\
  \ of adventures connected by the non-time of waiting, departures, staring out windows.\
  \ \n\nBut travel happens in every step from the familiar into the unknown. So the\
  \ very act of arriving somewhere foreign and new should be a saga worth the retelling.\n\
  \nAlas most of us step into the unknown by navigating tediously familiar duty free\
  \ shops, baggage carousel, the drive to the hotel an almost universal template of\
  \ car showrooms and concrete.  Where\u2019s the immediacy?  The shock of the new?\n\
  \nNo wonder Iceland slammed into me because I arrived by sea. \n\nSimply by avoiding\
  \ the airport, I clambered into a foreign, unexpected land as it looked the other\
  \ way, distracted by it\u2019s domestic concerns.\n\nIf the point of travel is to\
  \ experience the strangeness of others, and to be the stranger, find adventure in\
  \ the non-time of arriving quietly, without fuss or crowds, queues or questions.\
  \  \n\nFind the back door, and shut it quietly behind you when you head home."
