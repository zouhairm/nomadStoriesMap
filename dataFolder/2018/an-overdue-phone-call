Text: "\"My wife. If I could have one wish granted before I die, it would be to hear\
  \ her voice once again.\" \n\nI have been here with Alexander, or Sasha as he wants\
  \ me to call him, for just over an hour at this point. My first stop in the country\
  \ was Maidan Nezalezhnosti, the site of the revolution four years ago and after\
  \ visiting the revolution museum there, I headed to the Irpin military hospital,\
  \ a few hours' drive away.\n\nThe conversation was stunted at first but once the\
  \ topic shifted to the war it picked up. He told me about his life on the front.\
  \ He joined the army three years ago, patriotism still high after the revolution\
  \ and people filled with a need to fight for their country. \n\nI asked him if he\
  \ regrets joining the army. He sighs before answering, a small smile on his face.\n\
  \n\"There are many things in my life that I wish had been different, but I would\
  \ never change how I fought for my people. I regret that I left my family to do\
  \ so, but in joining it meant that others, better than me, could stay and take care\
  \ of my country in my absence.\" He looks back at the large Ukrainian flag draped\
  \ across the wall behind him and smiles.\n\nI sit, stunned for a moment before asking\
  \ my next question: Is there anything you wish you could change about your life\
  \ right now?\n\nI expect for him to wish for his leg back, or perhaps to leave the\
  \ hospital.\n\n\"My wife. If I could have one wish granted before I die, it would\
  \ be to hear her voice once again.\" \n\nMy brow furrows as I ask why he doesn't\
  \ simply call her. Sasha laughs, his face lit up as though I've told some hilarious\
  \ joke. The sound fills the otherwise quiet hospital. \n\n\"My boy, if I could,\
  \ I would have a long time ago. Perhaps it is best that I don't speak with her,\
  \ my injury would only worry her.\" His smile dies as he answers and I ask my next\
  \ question: Hasn't your family visited you?\n\n\"They don't know I am here. The\
  \ country is poor, the money it makes goes to the war or it is taken by the rich.\
  \ The hospital barely has the money to treat us, they won't spend any to contact\
  \ those we know. If I want to talk to my family, I have to organise it and I don't\
  \ have a phone, or the money to buy one.\"\n\nAfter his willingness to speak with\
  \ me the least I could do is help him, so I reach for my phone and hand it over\
  \ to him. I tell him to call his wife, knowing that she will be happy to hear from\
  \ him.\n\nHe smiles at me and dials. When he hangs up, tears are in his eyes. \n\
  \n\"Thank you, my wife and children are on their way here now.\""
