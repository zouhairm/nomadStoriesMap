Text: "I hadn\u2019t been on a bicycle since high school, and it struck me suddenly\
  \ how absurd that old saying was, about simple things being like riding one. Here\
  \ I was, balanced precariously on a too-tall rusted old ten speed with gears that\
  \ didn\u2019t seem interested in functioning. I did not feel any sense of muscle\
  \ memory, only a great fear of how this would all play out. \n\n I\u2019d been in\
  \ the Netherlands for just a few days at that point, and had been single-minded\
  \ in my mission to assimilate to the culture. I had tasted a multitude of cheeses,\
  \ wandered through literal mazes of tulips, and sipped a fizzy, berry-flavored brew\
  \ that the locals simply called Kriek. \nMy hosts had explained to me that the weekly\
  \ open air market was not to be missed, and that I would want a bike to carry home\
  \ all the produce I would undoubtedly buy there. Hesitant to expose myself as so\
  \ very American in my unsteadiness on a bike, I gratefully accepted the loan and\
  \ peddled nervously in the direction of the main square. \n\nI got myself there\
  \ without incident, locked the bike and wandered through the stalls. I felt pleasantly\
  \ jostled by a river of bodies and voices as I pointed at a large loaf of crusty\
  \ bread, a zucchini larger than my forearm, and small containers of fruits I did\
  \ not recognize. The vendors sensed my heritage without my saying a word, and they\
  \ spoke to me in seamless English. I wanted badly to melt into this place, to become\
  \ so ingrained in the culture that they spoke Dutch to me, and that I could speak\
  \ it in return. \n\n Piling my purchases into the bike\u2019s frayed wicker basket,\
  \ I began the short trip back to the flat. I passed a large church, and was struck\
  \ by a slender red door at the top of a few stone steps. The distraction was all\
  \ it took for me to tip the handlebars a bit too far to the left, wedging my front\
  \ wheel neatly between two cobblestones and bringing me to an immediate stop. I\
  \ tumbled quickly, the bike landing on top of me as I watched my beautiful loaf\
  \ of bread snap in two. \n\n I felt gentle hands on my shoulders, and looked up\
  \ into the eyes of two men in their seventies. They helped me to my feet, both murmuring\
  \ in Dutch as one offered his crisp cloth handkerchief for my bloodied knee. They\
  \ smiled, gathering my fallen produce back into the basket, and I found myself at\
  \ a loss for words. Kindness, once again, had proven to be a language all its own.\
  \ In that moment, I knew this place was already home to me, and that these people\
  \ were already happy to have me there."
