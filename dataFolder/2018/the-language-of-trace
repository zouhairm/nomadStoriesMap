Text: "\u2018Fifty years ago,\u2019 says Omar, \u2018No woman was covered her face\
  \ in our region.\u2019 He is the second high-ranking Saudi from Azir who has taken\
  \ pains to communicate this. \n Omar is dressed in traditional \u2018Flowers-Men\u2019\
  \ clothes, complete with floral head-wreath. Behind him, a sweeping desert valley.\
  \ Behind us, his village, Rojal, climbs into the shadow of a green hillside. Rojal\
  \ dates back to 550 Hegira (1160AD) as a trade hub and scientific and academic centre\
  \ to which \u2018students from many countries came\u2019 according to Omar's book,\
  \ \u2018Rojal: Memory of Arab Village\u2019. The book is an achingly desperate effort\
  \ to preserve his people\u2019s vanishing story, as is Omar\u2019s dedication to\
  \ restoring Rojal and finding ways for tourists - still rare in Saudi - to visit\
  \ the site and learn its past. \n Omar leads us to the new amphitheatre, constructed\
  \ for cultural performances and social gatherings, where we look up at Rojal\u2019\
  s ancient crumbling structures, partially restored, their multiple floors carved\
  \ into the steep hillside. Faced with neat rows of shuttered windows, they recall\
  \ modern apartments. Nearby, a small museum houses artefacts, jewellery, clothing,\
  \ costumes and tools from the village\u2019s recent past. \n \u2018You know, our\
  \ religion,\u2019 Omar continues, \u2018it\u2019s important some people the women\
  \ cover the head, the hair. So she put the scarf, but not the face! Fifty years\
  \ or less ago we are together with everyone. Men, women, talking and greeting and\
  \ meeting. And now\u2026 Very sad. These changes. Very sad.\u2019 \n Bravely, he\
  \ refers to the spread of Wahhabi Islam, which has accompanied the relatively recent\
  \ conquering and unification of the various tribes and regions of what is now called\
  \ Saudi Arabia. \n \u2018Will it change again?\u2019 someone asks. \n \u2018Change?\
  \ Yes! Of course! Maybe soon.\u2019 Omar seems surprised by the question. \u2018\
  Because seventy years ago everything tribes, and many changes and now we become\
  \ - what is it? - civil society and then, maybe, change is easier.\u2019\n We are\
  \ left to make what we can of this and for my part I believe Omar takes the long\
  \ view; change happens, then happens again. His tribe\u2019s story has blurred with\
  \ Al-Saud rule, the black abaya, the forming of Saudi, and the many laws and social\
  \ customs imposed as a result, creating what outsiders understand as Saudi culture.\
  \ But this will change again, and perhaps Omar\u2019s efforts will help. \n As we\
  \ leave Rojal, I open the book and read:\n\u2018\u2026When pen withdraws\nLeaving\
  \ place to vestiges and ruins\nThen we are here to master the language of trace\u2019"
