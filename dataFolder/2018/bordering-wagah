Text: "BORDERING WAGAH\nThe hot winds blew through my hair. The winds made me aware\
  \ of the tension that the region possessed.  I was eager to witness the historic\
  \ event; I had been longing for and was prepared to experience what it offered.\
  \ I grew up listening to the stories of partition, but today I was here to collect\
  \ stories and experience the breathtaking ceremony at the India-Pakistan Border,\
  \ popularly known as the Wagah Border. I reached Atari, the nearest village from\
  \ Wagah Border. Bag in one hand and the camera in another, I got down from the taxi\
  \ and glanced at the sun. It was shining bright. I put my shades on and started\
  \ walking towards Wagah. My palms began to sweat as we approached the border. I\
  \ was more curious than excited. The border was just 100m away. Children, students,\
  \ families, foreigners everyone was gathered. Hawkers selling Wagah CDs, Taj Mahal\
  \ models, Key chains permeated through the crowd. I joined the protracted line of\
  \ the security check up. After the inspection, I was lead to a long paved path that\
  \ led to the official border where the ceremony took place. At the distance of roughly\
  \ 80m were two soaring iron gates. Both sides of the street were lined up with sidewalks\
  \ for people. Glancing through the iron gates, the sidewalks of Pakistan were visible.\
  \ People waving Pakistani flags , cheering and clapping to music was as similar\
  \ as at the Indian side. Shouts of \u201CHindustan Zindabad\u201D(Long Live India)\
  \ were echoed by the shouts of \u201CPakistan Zindabad\u201D(Long Live Pakistan)\
  \ from the other side. The ceremony began with a roar of the border guards on both\
  \ the sides. Once the battle call of both the sides was done, the soldiers marched\
  \ down towards each other with a series of synchronized kicks and extravagant stomps.\
  \ This gallant display continued for about 15 minutes. At this point of time, the\
  \ patriotic tension was palpable in the atmosphere. The show came to end with the\
  \ lowering of both the flags precisely at the same time and a brief handshake displaying\
  \ good faith despite the tumult. The gates were closed yet again with India and\
  \ Pakistan as different nations. \nThe crowd dispersed while I remained devouring\
  \ what I had witnessed. The history of India flashed through my mind.  But it\u2019\
  s heart-warming to know that every night, at least for a brief moment, both countries\
  \ are unified through the closing of their border gates."
