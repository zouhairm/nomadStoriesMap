Text: "The suffocating air of the Pink City strangled me as I stepped outside the\
  \ Jaipur Airport. It is something you never get used to, and although it is a terrible\
  \ sensation, there was a part of me that always anxiously awaited that moment, that\
  \ separated the falsehood of the world we all left behind, from the land of colours\
  \ and gods.They gave me a contact, at the house I was staying, India functions on\
  \ the basis of contacts, its all about the locals. So I arrived at Prithviraj Road\
  \ in the heart of the city, I needed a rickshaw. I asked for \"the boss\", wiggling\
  \ their head from side to side, as if dancing to the rhythm of life they pointed\
  \ a rickshaw in the corner, under the Banyan tree. \"Hello, are you Pradesh?\" I\
  \ inquired with a sturdy voice, in India you always need to resemble a local, especially\
  \ being a foreigner. \"Morning, chalo, 3000 \u20B9 all day, special price for you\
  \ madame!\", I already knew he was trying to fool me, but Indians are men of the\
  \ heart, so I let the matter slip, and decided we would rearrange the price situation\
  \ at the end of the trip. \"Madame, where are we going?\". Intently I asked him,\
  \ \"Oh Pradesh, take me to your places, take me where eat at lunch break, and where\
  \ your daughter got her first sari made, I want to see Jaipur from your eyes,\"\
  . \"Beautiful idea madame,\" said Pradesh with a smile. As promised, we ate where\
  \ the rickshaw drivers have lunch, he then took me to an underground jewellery factory,\
  \ where it seemed to me was concentrated all of Jaipur's beauty and treasures, the\
  \ silver was liquid and lay vast all over the floor. \"India is like this, you never\
  \ believe what you see,\" whispered Pradesh as we sat down while waiting for my\
  \ sari to be finished. It went on for a week, every morning Pradesh would be waiting\
  \ for me at Prithviraj Road and he would carry me to unravel the astounding beauties\
  \ of the magical city, I met his friends, his son, I also met the fear of being\
  \ alone and the desire to be free, I prayed in the house of Shiva and walked on\
  \ the sins of the maharajahs. And as my vacation was over I asked him the for the\
  \ bill, and with a smile told me \"do not worry madame, money is not real, we just\
  \ think that it is\" he put a hand on my shoulder and continued \"you were a great\
  \ company this week, not many like you come by\". I can still see him today, Pradesh,\
  \ with his familiar smile, the marked lineaments of a man who had nothing but smiled\
  \ for everything, he could see beyond the banalities of life, and into a pool of\
  \ truth."
