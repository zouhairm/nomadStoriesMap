Text: 'Travelling in India means travelling to the places where there are loads of
  chaos but still we can enjoy its beauty. Frankly speaking i had not visited to many
  places but as being an Indian i can describe each and every places here. The best
  thing about me is I am from Mumbai  Maharashtra,Where one can find various religions
  and traditions. There are so many people out here who speak different languages,celebrate
  all the festivals and having different lifestyles. The best thing is that being
  a person from West Bengal i enjoy all the festivals celebrated by people from different
  states. No matter If I am from north part of India, I Still enjoy Onam with my friends
  who belongs from south India.I enjoy all the famous delicacies of different states
  like BIRYANI OF HYDERABAD, IDLI OF TAMILNADU etc.

  Mumbai is a commercial capital of India and there are various places here to see
  like Museums , Beaches and especially Night Life of Mumbai. Talking about other
  places in Maharshtra i have been to Matheran Hills located in western ghats at elevation
  around 800 m which is 120 km from Pune. It offers 38 designated look-out points
  offersthe 360 degree view of the surrounding area and famous for matheran hill railway.

  Lonar Lake- Its is created by Meteor Impact at lonar in Bulanda. It is heaven for
  wide range plants and animals life like chinkara, gerbes etc

  Kalsubai Peak- This place will be always in my memories as i had visited for trekking
  for the first time in here. It is the highest mountain peak of sahayadri mountain
  range of maharashtra and famous for kalsubhai temple.'
