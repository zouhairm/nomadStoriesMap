Text: "We are the sum of each moment of our history and that includes all the places\
  \ we have traveled, it is not us who travel through the cities, it is the cities\
  \ that travel through us, and as we transform them, they transform us, they mark\
  \ us forever. I could say that I am a mixture of all the places I have seen, who\
  \ knows me could not tell at first sight where I am from. But in some cases, I think\
  \ there are people who specifically contain a city. You look them in the eyes, listen\
  \ to them, feel them, and Eureka! it's Paris talking to you! or London!\nWhen I\
  \ lived in Buenos Aires, in my small apartment of 30m2 square, in the tree-lined\
  \ Thames Street, I met in Facebook a romantic neapolitan who was living in Milan.\n\
  The Atlantic separated us, but what is an ocean when you are in love?\nAfter plans\
  \ and months of waiting, I embarked full of dreams and gifts to Rome, and after\
  \ 14 hours, one connection, and a tense interview with an immigration agent, my\
  \ feet stepped on Rome for the first time.\nSometimes 10 days passed in 60 minutes,\
  \ from his hand I walked Rome, Venice and the egocentric Milan. The time was not\
  \ enough, countless tears invaded the goodbye and despite all, our love did not\
  \ survive the distance.\nAlthough we met a few months later in Buenos Aires, baptized\
  \ by Massimiliano as a New York after the war, our story did not continue. \nI returned\
  \ to Italy many times, I loved Firenze and Siena, I left part of my heart in every\
  \ step in the glorious Sicily, I found my ancestors in Calabria and I loved Rome\
  \ again but everything took on another meaning when I stepped on Napoli.\nWhen I\
  \ saw Napoli for the first time, it was like having Massimiliano in front my eyes,\
  \ his accent, his energy, the color of his skin, his charm, everything was there,\
  \ in every step I took for that wonderful city, there he was walking hand in hand\
  \ with me, absent but constant.\nIt was in each piece of margherita, each espresso\
  \ with sfogliatella, was in the warm words of its citizens, in all the art and disorder.\
  \ Napoli was him and he was Napoli in person.\nSays the saying \"Vedere Napoli e\
  \ dopo morire\", she perfectly combines the intensity and peace, the chaos and the\
  \ divine order of the nature that surrounds her.\nSometimes we connect with the\
  \ cities and so many times the cities connect to us, with Napoli it was much more\
  \ than a local connection, Napoli and I will be connected forever, because without\
  \ knowing it, I loved her before I even met her, because without knowing it I will\
  \ love her forever."
