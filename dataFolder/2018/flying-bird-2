Text: "Believe it or not, I was always grown up Kid. \n well, at-least my parents\
  \ believed it. that's why at the age of three after my mother passes after her suicide\
  \ attempt, i was expected to suddenly behave like a mature person, since i had a\
  \ younger brother it gave reason for my father to get married as soon possible and\
  \ i was told that i am lucky to get new mother and i should treat her as my own.\n\
  \ My father worked at factory located in city of another state and decided to take\
  \ my brother and mother with him. I lived with grandma, she wont go outside neighborhood\
  \ unless some festivals or events organised in village as responsibilities outside\
  \ the home was managed by Men and even though all men from our family weren't in\
  \ village, it never stopped my grandma to follow rules made by man made society,\
  \ Hence i spent most of time  in my farm questioning workers about plants or at\
  \ school  boring my teacher with question like how children's are made. when i think\
  \ of it now, moments spent in village with grandma were golden years i experienced\
  \ from childhood. Her everyday stories which she will present in order to make me\
  \ leave book for dinner, Life for her always should work with clock. 8 pm dinner\
  \ ,9 pm bed , my school, the marriage and my life. only if she knew clock experiences\
  \ 12 dark hours. \n   As i awaited my turn to read English poem, pools of thought\
  \ runs through my head thinking how life can change into unexpected events in seconds.\
  \ My grandma gave up on me after 10 yrs as alien disease ends up taking her life,\
  \ My father got me in city and i got baby sister. Claps in response of my poem pulled\
  \ me back. I laughed thinking how i got rejected by English schools, was beaten\
  \ up for the same reason by parents ,will be abused whole life for it and here they\
  \ are applauding for the words i spoke which barely knew meaning. Studying in Hindi\
  \ school in city made me realize that local school at village did great.\n At 15\
  \ i found myself at station after 3rd attempt to leave Home where i was suicidal\
  \ most of the time. Marked job with stay from Newspaper, borrowed phone to talk\
  \ for interview, as i turned to return phone he asks my Name, Within a second my\
  \ lips replies -Misha. I never heard this name before but after that day each person\
  \ i met knows her. Life was never easy but one thing made me smile each day that\
  \ i was free. A baby bird learns to fly when it gets pushed by mama. I gave myself\
  \ same kind of push into present forgetting my past behind  to fly. \n Like a bird\
  \ !"
