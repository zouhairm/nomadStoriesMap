Text: "My brother was finishing a stint as a snowboard instructor in Japan and invited\
  \ me join him on a cross country tour with him.  Personally I think he thought it\
  \ would be a good \"last hurrah\" before settling down, although the fact that I\
  \ had to get the drivers license and bring most of the camping gear has never escaped\
  \ me.  I shook out my wallet, packed my gear, and met my brother in Tokyo.  Eating\
  \ was easy as every restaurant has its menu arrayed colored plastic pieces on plates\
  \ or on posters out front.  It was bustling, loud, and everyone should go into an\
  \ electronics store in Japan at least once.  I slept my very first night in a manga\
  \ comic book store cubicle.  The food is fantastic and we met some lovely people;\
  \ one gentleman even called his wife on our behalf just to make sure we had the\
  \ best bus fare possible.  \n     We worked our way to Osaka where we boarded a\
  \ bus, took the ride south to Naruto and a rental car.  My brother knows a little\
  \ Japanese but can't speak the language and the rental guys ended up shaking their\
  \ heads and letting us sign the paperwork anyway.  They brought up a new white Mazda\
  \ and we took off south on Hwy 55.  The ocean was grey under overcast spring skies\
  \ and green dome shaped mountains rose from both the land and the sea.  Head inland\
  \ almost anywhere and you end up between heavily wooded peaks on paved roads so\
  \ narrow that they are often only one lane wide with a momentous drop off.  The\
  \ winding roads use convex mirrors at all of the corners to see if there is any\
  \ traffic around the bend, and requiring one of you to stop.  Newer more used sections\
  \ of the highway, in more populated areas, are wider and have tunnels burrowing\
  \ through these mountains but the old roads still exist and were left to be overgrown\
  \ and reclaimed by the mountains. \n     On our last days with the car we decided\
  \ to go out on one of these roads.  It was dirt and had what looked like an amazing\
  \ view.  We hooked a right and drove off road for about thirty yards of rule breaking\
  \ before a solid green wall erupted in front of us followed by an odd sound.  We\
  \ had a flat rear tire, at dusk, in a new rental car, in a foreign country.  It\
  \ was full on dark by the time we had the spare out.  It was absolutely terrifying\
  \ worrying about the rental agency.  The next day we ashamedly turned the car in\
  \ to some very angry Japaneses men who couldn't understand us, nor we them.  My\
  \ brother paid more for that one tire than either one of has ever paid before or\
  \ since."
