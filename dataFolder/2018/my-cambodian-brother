Text: "I first met James in Bangkok in 2008. He was to be my guide into Cambodia,\
  \ and back then I was a very different traveler. \u201COne ddrrrrrriiiiiiinnnkkkk\u201D\
  \ was a saying of his that led me to have many memorable nights on the hot and sticky\
  \ Bangkok streets and the golden beaches of a Cambodia which were about to explode\
  \ onto the \u201Cbackpacker\u201D circuit.\n\nJames also showed me a very different\
  \ side. I was invited into his home in Siem Reap to share a meal with his family\
  \ and friends and a certain local delicacy of a half a formed chicken egg, We then\
  \ played football in the dust and heat of the Cambodian sunset, with the local children.\
  \ My memories of my first trip to the \u201CKingdom\u201D will always stay with\
  \ me. Our instant friendship and my first astonishing visit to the temples of Angkor\
  \ have led me to return over five times since. \n\nBetween my visits, James practiced\
  \ as a Buddhist monk, a tradition of most Cambodians and continued his career guiding.\
  \ He was also voted the second best tour guide in the world by National Geographic.\
  \ His success has enabled him to now have his own guesthouse in Siem Reap, his own\
  \ beautiful family; plus allowed him to continue his passion of welcoming people\
  \ into his country, his home and showing them the great temples of Angkor.\n\nWe\
  \ have always remained in touch and as technology has improved we have been able\
  \ to communicate in other ways in the form of videos and photos. A change in my\
  \ circumstances led me to a career in scuba diving, which fortunately led me to\
  \ living in the \u201CKingdom\u201D itself in Sihanoukville. James and I had the\
  \ pleasure of meeting frequently, as he guided tours around his Cambodia. James\u2019\
  \ tour groups were always impressed at our close friendship and our story.\n\nI\
  \ revisited James this year with my family, staying at his home. Where we danced,\
  \ played and read the report cards of the local children in his village, which he\
  \ is now able to sponsor to go to school. He guided us around the temples of Angkor,\
  \ imparting his knowledge and passion of this special place on all of us. The friendship\
  \ James and I share continues to grow, such as, this year I hope to host himself\
  \ and his family here in Melbourne. \n\nIt has been James that has shared with me\
  \ his country, his people and these temples that have led me to return again and\
  \ again. Still today, I feel I share a connection, and experience d\xE9j\xE0 vu\
  \ of knowing James and his country. This familiarisation with James and his country\
  \ is remarkable in comparison to my own."
