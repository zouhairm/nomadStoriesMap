Text: "The air was cool and musky with the scent of fallen blossoms. Standing on the\
  \ guesthouse terrace, I watched the last light dim behind a black mountain in Shyok\
  \ Valley, Ladakh.\nI was in Turtuk. Inhabited by the Balti tribe of Shi\u2019a Muslims,\
  \ it is set one hundred feet above the water table on a shelf flushed green with\
  \ apricot trees and buckwheat. It is known as the last village in India because\
  \ the dark ridge that faced me marked the Pakistani border. I had been travelling\
  \ in India for six months, and could go no further.\n\n\u2018Soldiers up there,\u2019\
  \ said my host, shuffling to my side. Miming, he shot a rifle at the sunset, then\
  \ dusted his hands, chuckling. Even when the grin had faded from his lips, his deep-set\
  \ eyes continued to smile, yet also shimmered as if close to tears.\n\nAhmed-Hussain,\
  \ at 68, was an elder of the village. Every evening, we sat on the lantern-lit terrace,\
  \ eating rice and dahl with buckwheat chapatti, telling stories. That smile flickered\
  \ in his eyes as he spoke, a tuft of white hair quivering on his chin.\nI told him\
  \ I had come to Turtuk to rest, having spent months trekking solo through Ladakh.\
  \ I had hitchhiked over the 18,500 foot Khardung-la, then traversed Shyok on foot.\
  \ The sheer walls I walked between were 10,000 foot monoliths, while the plains\
  \ were an arid collage of desert, purple granite and poplars. After four days, I\
  \ arrived in Turtuk.\n\n\u2018How heavy your bag?\u2019 he asked.\n\u2018About 50.\u2019\
  \n\u201950 kilo? No problem.\u2019\n\nHe explained that Turtuk had been a part of\
  \ Pakistan. In the 1971 war India\u2019s army captured Turtuk and enslaved its men,\
  \ forcing them to carry supplies to Husa to build military bases. Husa is four days\
  \ and four nights away, a walk which they did without sleep, once a week, for four\
  \ years.\nAll they had to eat was rice. He used his hands to describe how great\
  \ his heaps of rice had been. It was then I noticed his mangled fingers.\nWhen I\
  \ enquired, the creases deepened around his brow.\n\n\u20181994.\u2019\n\u2018The\
  \ year of my birth,\u2019 I said.\n\u2018Year of my death,\u2019 he replied. \u2018\
  Almost.\u2019\n\nHe had been crossing Khardung-la with a friend one snowy day in\
  \ April. The car slipped, falling three hundred feet. The driver was killed. Though\
  \ Ahmed-Hussain survived, his legs were broken and he had to drag himself through\
  \ the snow for three hours until he reached a road.\nSipping fresh mint tea, I came\
  \ to realise that enduring these struggles had given him his smile. He had fought\
  \ for his life, as well as his hands, which lay crumpled in his lap as he ended\
  \ his story."
