Text: "Connections are made every day, by everyone. Connecting with others is the\
  \ very reason for our existence. My story is about making a local connection. But\
  \ not in the way that you\u2019d think. \n\nMy story begins over 100 years ago,\
  \ when a young New Zealander sets sail across the ocean for the biggest adventure\
  \ of his life. George Manning Percy, 18, heading off to fight in the war. He had\
  \ no idea what was awaiting him in France, and no idea that it would be his final\
  \ resting place. \n\nFast-forward to April 2016 when I, another young New Zealander,\
  \ set off on my big journey across the globe, to teach English in France. A na\xEF\
  ve 18-year-old, thinking how big the world is and how I\u2019m heading off to face\
  \ it. With bigger-than-life ambitions of growing and finding myself, I had no idea\
  \ what was awaiting me. \n\nA few weeks into my trip I found myself chancing a free\
  \ ride to Northern France to visit the Caterpillar Valley Cemetery, a memorial for\
  \ the New Zealand soldiers killed in battle in 1916. I vaguely knew of my ancestor\
  \ who was one of the thousands to fight and die on The Somme that year. What I didn\u2019\
  t know was the connection I would have to it.\n\nIt seems impossible to think about\
  \ making a connection with someone so far in the past, but something about that\
  \ moment hit home for me. Standing in a field of tombstones, searching for my great\
  \ great uncle\u2019s name was the most connected to the past that I had ever felt.\
  \ And it took me traveling all the way across the world to feel like that.  \n\n\
  I tried to picture George arriving in France. He was the same age as me when he\
  \ got here. Did he too marvel at the Eiffel Tower? Did he too eat countless croissants?\
  \ Did he too stare out across this same European countryside thinking about life\u2019\
  s possibilities? Maybe. But maybe not. Maybe he got straight into battle. Maybe\
  \ he saw hundreds of his friends killed. Maybe he was wishing to be back home in\
  \ our tiny country. \n\nWe\u2019re different, yes. Our reasons for coming to France\
  \ were different. Our experiences here were different. But still, we\u2019re the\
  \ same. Young people, ten thousand miles from home, trying to find ourselves in\
  \ a place so much bigger than us. A part of us both will forever remain in France.\
  \ \n\nAfter Caterpillar Valley, I had grown. I hadn\u2019t found myself, no, and\
  \ I still haven\u2019t. But what I did find was a greater sense of connection, and\
  \ what it means to connect to someone. I realised that you don\u2019t have to be\
  \ in the same place at the same time to share a connection."
