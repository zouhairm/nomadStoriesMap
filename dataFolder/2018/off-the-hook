Text: "The couple cuddled against dawn\u2019s merry chill, on the bed next to Rob\u2019\
  s, and it was time to go. \u201COur friend doesn\u2019t want to part,\u201D she\
  \ smiled, kissed her lover. Rob gave a drowzy leer at the couple. A traveler and\
  \ a local- the loveliest of couples! They inspired him! They had taught him love\u2019\
  s spontaneous.\nHe frowned. Had he had the guts to ask the girl on the beach for\
  \ a hike, as young Zac urged him to, perhaps he\u2019d have learned it on the flesh.\
  \ But that had been on the first days of the trip; when his new self hadn\u2019\
  t yet taken over.\n   All the while Zac\u2019s lute whispered in the room, of a\
  \ night that was dying.\n   \u201CI feel him,\u201D the jungle man kissed her back,\
  \ his accent hella funny. \u201CHe\u2019s not going on a quest for gems like us.\u201D\
  \ The fucker had a post of minerals in the market, and she was an arthisan. They\
  \ met and found a way to grow together.\n   Zac sneered, \u201Che\u2019s chosen\
  \ to go back to the matrix,\u201D strummed a dissonant chord. \u201CWake up!\u201D\
  \n   Rob woke at last: had a lousy plane to catch. \u201CGods be damned,\u201D he\
  \ mumbled, \u201Cyou guys. I want to take that bus deep into the jungle with you...\u201D\
  \ If only!! But his job -his money- was back in the city. He felt miserable for\
  \ the first time in fourteen days...\n   \u201CWe\u2019ve been through this, sweetheart...\u201D\
  \ she said. \u201CWe want you to join too.\u201D\n   Zac echoed his thesis: \u201C\
  I want you to take to your travel writing and make a living out of it, instead of...-\
  \ you know, being settled for a living which upsets you, and has nothing to do with\
  \ your passion.\u201D No pity. Not even in the last hour they\u2019d spend together\
  \ for...-ever? Zac had a pair.\n   Rob was gloomy, as in the past. \u201CGot to\
  \ check out the guesthouse.\u201D He shuffled his feet to the door, to the end of\
  \ the corridor, to the counter by the entrance of the main hut and, before turning\
  \ to face the receptionist, he glanced outdoors. There was the very bus his friends\
  \ -his best friends- were taking at noon.\n   He saw himself reflected on its sidepanes-\
  \ his past self.\n   They stared. Past and present selves were one as the glare\
  \ went on, regretting each other so much...-\n   Until they split. For as the cry\
  \ of a bird rippled through the window pane, the image of his sad past self on it\
  \ blurred, and as the casualty made him smile and the glass turned flat again, Rob\
  \ beheld the confident, awonder Rob he\u2019d met in the wilderness.\n   Only then\
  \ he turned round, flaring resolve. And beaming at the receptionist he smashed a\
  \ fat bill on the counter. \u201CGood morning!!\u201D"
