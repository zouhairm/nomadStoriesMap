Text: "I sighed, unable to sleep. Change positions. I roll over to my side tucking\
  \ my pillow under my head. On the other side of the room is a large window and a\
  \ glass door leading to garden. In the dark, I make out the silhouettes of the strips\
  \ of flowers, the tall leafy plants and the gaps between them showing the winding\
  \ path. Hours ago, I watched my host mother carefully tending to the plants before\
  \ she went inside. This is my first night in my German host family\u2019s home.\
  \ Maybe I\u2019m homesick. \n\n         After an 11- hour flight, we landed in Zurich\
  \ before we head to Donaueschigen, Baden-Wurttemberg for our study abroad trip.\
  \ Our host families waited for  at the host school. Although my host family knew\
  \ of me, I still feared mistreatment because of my ebony skin. I had mustered out\
  \ hello in my best German to my host mom who smiled. She began speaking in German\
  \ and I stared baffled, unable to comprehend. \u2018Du lernst f\xFCr mich, Ich lerne\
  \ f\xFCr dich.' She said slowly. Meaning \u2018You learn for me, I learn for you\u2019\
  . I had to learn German for them, and she would learn English for me.\n\n      \
  \   As we drove home, my host brother described the Black Forest, a large forested\
  \ mountain range in Baden \u2013 Wurttemberg. The thick evergreen canopy forest\
  \ is the home of Cuckoo clocks and the Brothers Grimm fairytale. The forest houses\
  \ the Rhine ,a river emerging near Lake Constance, Switzerland, flowing westward\
  \ and emptying near the Netherlands in the North Sea. He continued on about the\
  \ nearby cities of Freiburg, a vibrant town, and Baden \u2013 Baden, Europe\u2019\
  s spa town.  \n\n        Homesickness and insomnia aside, I see the sun is rising.\
  \ I sigh even deeper. I hear footsteps coming down the hall and my door cracks open.\
  \ \u2018Guten Morgen.\u2019 I say sitting up. My host mom greets me. \u2018Fr\xFC\
  hst\xFCck, breakfast.\u2019 I get up and follow her out to the table. Their home\
  \ is sleek, with an ample amount of natural lighting. At the table were all the\
  \ makings of a German breakfast - tea, coffee, and a large plate of wurst and brot,\
  \ bread, with butter, honey, and jam. I eat quietly, enjoying the typical German\
  \ breakfast. Apparently today, I am riding the bike to school. I ride with my host\
  \ sister and some local kids. They lead me, as I trail behind learning the back-roads\
  \ of this new country. We arrive late to school, due to my several stop breaks.\
  \ I rush into class and find my new classmates waiting for me. They want to practice\
  \ their English and learn my American slang but, I am here to learn German."
