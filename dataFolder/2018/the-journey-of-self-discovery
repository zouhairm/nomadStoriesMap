  Why you left your job for this trip?\u201D\u201CA solo trip for girl is not easy!\u201D\
  \u201CPeople will call you insane to take such foolish decisions!\u201DThese all\
  \ were the reactions of my mother when I told her about my solo trip for 37 days\
  \ to North India while waiting at the Mumbai Airport for my flight to Chandigarh.Yes,I\
  \ took a life changing decision of resigning my job & going for solo trip to North\
  \ India.Everyone had warned me not to go.I was determined to prove them wrong.My\
  \ 25-year-old gumption was giving me voices of reason for travelling to the world\
  \ of mountains.Voices which were quickly drowned out by the poof, a bark, whir of\
  \ the wings of plane.No turning back now.I nervously twirled the silver band on\
  \ my ring finger as flight was about to take off.This was first time I took a journey\
  \ in flight.I belong to a small village Yavatmal in India that is not recognized\
  \ on map of India.The place is connected by roadways.So never got a chance to sit\
  \ in flight.Soon my flight took off and my eyes were arrested by the view outside\
  \ the glass pane of my window.Often,these great views surprise us,we just happen\
  \ to be in the right seat at the right time of day.Travelling has always been my\
  \ dream and aged 25, in my grey life.I slaved away as a system engineer in private\
  \ firm and thought the time has come when I should quit and start for the journey\
  \ to dreamy world of mountains.My planning involved sitting with the books,laptop\
  \ &maps & researching every place wherever I wanted to go.Chandigarh,the planned\
  \ city of India was my first destination.My next destination was Amritsar,the city\
  \ of Golden temple.The golden temple is a beautiful place,it\u2019s not just the\
  \ architecture but the place has this serenity,calmness that just bowled me over,the\
  \ music they play all day is mind soothing.It was now time to move towards world\
  \ of gigantic Himalayas.Mt.Shitidhar is snow-clad peak perched at an altitude of\
  \ 5250m in PirPanjal range,in Kullu District of Himachal Pradesh.Mt.Shitidhar doesn\u2019\
  t require knowledge & experience of technical climbing that\u2019s what made me\
  \ to choose this as my first trek.Every step to the climb was reminding me of the\
  \ efforts that I took to travel this long.Finally,when I made it to the top my joy\
  \ knew no leaps and bounds.The mesmerizing views & deathly silence, away from the\
  \ agonies of the life, cold windy air blowing around making gushing sound touching\
  \ my cheeks & nose was making me realize how seclusion is a bliss."
