Text: "\u201CPing Pong Show\u2026 all sexy girls\u2026 very hot!\u201D Exclaimed the\
  \ guy in his early twenties. His Mongol eyes had a hint of strange temptation. Many\
  \ of them frequent The Walking Street of Pattaya, Thailand, otherwise known as the\
  \ Sin City! As he foreign tourists deluge the stretch of road, dotted with myriad\
  \ genres of strip clubs (Indian Mujras, Go Go Club, Russian Show, etc), these guys\
  \ pitch in with laminated handouts detailing the \u2018menu\u2019 of the acts! \n\
  The mornings in Pattaya are sombre. Tuktuks ferry people from the crescent moon\
  \ beach to Na Jomtien. Succulent meat pieces are roasted on Shawarma Machine. Fresh\
  \ catch of the day is served with the Tom Yum soup in roadside stalls. A street\
  \ hawker selling grilled eggs on skewers can be spotted in the alleys. The way he\
  \ adds the spice mix with egg yolk inside the shell calls for an uncanny efficiency.\n\
  However, that stands nowhere close to the act of puffing a few trails of smokes\
  \ from the vagina of a Ping Pong Show performer. For a keen observer, the cigarette\
  \ burns on her thighs are easily identified. We had paid USD 10 for the first evening\
  \ show that entails the viewers sip on exorbitantly priced drink while watching\
  \ the hedonics. Bikini clad women insert alien objects, even live frogs, into the\
  \ vagina. The show ends with a couple of women engaged in fornication styles, from\
  \ the pages of Kamasutra. As I sat by the Pattaya beach at night, sated after a\
  \ relaxing session of Thai massage, I thought of the women from the Ping Pong Show,\
  \ probably raising their legs to the next set of audience. I tasted blood in my\
  \ mouth.\nI grew up learning any discussion pertaining to sex as taboo. To an extent\
  \ that my parents would criticize Bollywood actress dancing in short skirts and\
  \ readily change the TV channel. Fleeting glimpses of saree-clad women, drenched\
  \ in monsoon rain by the streets of Sonagachi of Kolkata return in my mind as the\
  \ few encounters I had with the hometown\u2019s sex trade. I did walk by the side\
  \ of Sonagachi but never dared to enter the area. Hailing from such a culture, Ping\
  \ Pong show introduced me to a world unknown! I learnt about the poverty-stricken\
  \ women of Thailand and neighboring nations taking part in the trade, often balancing\
  \ a fine line with the threat of trafficking and prostitution. The decision to watch\
  \ the show had had me guilt ridden for days. Instead of delving into judgement pangs,\
  \ I decided to learn, understand and extend support to NGOs who strive to make this\
  \ world a better place for women."
