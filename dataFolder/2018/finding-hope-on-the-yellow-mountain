Text: "At 7 am on a Friday morning I walked up to the ticket booth of the Huangshan\
  \ Mountain. I waited in line impatiently as I was eager to start climbing the Yellow\
  \ Mountain. The sun was starting to rise over the sky, and the coming weather would\
  \ be 38 Celsius with an 85% humidity. The air was already warm and I felt my back\
  \ already starting to sweat.  I walked up and asked the lady for an entrance ticket,\
  \ and she asked me if I also wanted a ticket to ride the elevator to the top of\
  \ the mountain. I declined and she stared back at me with shock, which turned into\
  \ a sly smile as if to tell me how naive I was. I shrugged her off and got ready\
  \ to climb.\n\nI remember the climb at the start being relatively easy, but about\
  \ 20 minutes in, the path had turned into stairs and I knew this was going to be\
  \ tough. It was grueling, and I was soaked from head to toe in sweat, the sun now\
  \ shining and beaming down like the ground was a skillet. After about 2.5 hours\
  \ of stairs, I made it to the top where I yelled at the top of my lungs screaming\
  \ \"WOOO\". Everybody looked at me, laughed, smiled, and even asked to take my picture.\
  \ From there I explored the caverns and the peak of the mountain where it was cool\
  \ and cold. I had a brief but very satisfying lunch there and made my way back to\
  \ the entrance point to now climb down the mountain. \n\nThe signs were in Chinese\
  \ so I saw stairs going down and I took them, almost running down these steps to\
  \ make sure I catch the bus. I finally reach a gate, realizing I took a wrong turn,\
  \ and my heart started pounding with fear. I reach a jungled area where construction\
  \ was going on. I ask them where am I? The man looks at me, takes out a pamphlet\
  \ with Chinese and English translations and points to \"You have gone the wrong\
  \ way\", \"You need to climb back up\".\n\nI sat down with my head in my hands exhausted,\
  \ praying for any help, just to get me safely back to the hostel. Just then two\
  \ British girls walked down to the same gate I did, who also spoke Mandarin to my\
  \ shock. They made a deal with the men to get us back to the closest bus station.\
  \ The next 3 hours of my life would be spent in different transportation vehicles.\
  \ We first took a minibus to a border, where we took a taxi to the bus station,\
  \ a bus to a taxi station, and a taxi back to the hostel. Never in my life had I\
  \ been more relieved and hopeful. To this day, I do not know their names or know\
  \ how this all happened, but I believe I was sent 2 angels by the universe to help\
  \ me get back home."
