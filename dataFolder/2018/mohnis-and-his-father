Text: "In June 2013, i did my first solo travel to kashmir. During the first week\
  \ of the trip, i stayed at my dearest friend Asif's house in Srinagar. At that time\
  \ Asif's uncle, Iftiqaar with his wife and son Mohnis came down to the house to\
  \ spend few days with Asif's family. 'Navin bhai' take my picture, as soon as Mohnis\
  \ sees the camera in my hand , his body will start bursting in to all the physical\
  \ dimensions he could move in to and try fitting in those spaces with his restless\
  \ yet strong willed soul. He wanted \"the best\" photos for himself and his father\
  \ too. Iftiqaar in his college days wanted to be an actor, which i got to know slowly\
  \ as i shared my days filled with lots of good kashmiri food and chattering with\
  \ him about theatre, life, acting, music ,and of course 'ALLAH' (GOD). Asif will\
  \ slowly mutter in my ears whenever he is going to the mosque to offer prayer, \"\
  think about it, being a muslim is not that bad at all, convert yourself\" and i\
  \ will laugh out loud, slowly and gently unfolding myself to the scent of the living\
  \ beings around me in the house. Well, being a muslim is not that bad at all. i\
  \ was in love with the people around me in that house. Apart from Mohnis , rest\
  \ of the house was well in sink with the idea of praying five times a day. Mohnis\
  \ didn't like whenever his father looked for his Rug to offer prayer, he would go\
  \ run around and try to disturb him, sometimes even try to pull out the rug imagining\
  \ himself to be a \"Bad boy\". But in all his pictures he couldn't hide \"the infinite\"\
  \ in his eyes, and each time iftiqaar tried to make a picture perfect pose together\
  \ with Mohnis, i tried my best to capture that essence of his love for his child.\
  \ In our part of the world, very few father are that expressive yet subtle. \"i\
  \ don't have a single picture with father except if they are for some official document\
  \ purpose\", with this thought i would go on and on trying to take that perfect\
  \ picture of Mohnis and his father. \nRecently after 5 years, i managed to send\
  \ iftiqaar the photos i took that time, my only local connection with that time\
  \ and space where once Mohnis and his father , existed together."
