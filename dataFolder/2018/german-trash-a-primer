Text: "You\u2019d think trash sorting would be a fairly straightforward process, right?\
  \ You simply separate glass and plastics (and maybe your compost) and you\u2019\
  re good to go. But after a couple of months into my time abroad in Leipzig, Germany,\
  \ I was still perplexed\_by the task, wondering if I\u2019d ever learn.\n\nIt seemed\
  \ easy enough at first: a few color-coded bins and a neighborhood collection point\
  \ for glass, but upon closer inspection, things quickly got complicated. One confusing\
  \ element was that the color of the containers was inconsistent from place to place.\
  \ Paper and cardboard went in the blue bin at my building, but at my friend Elfi\u2019\
  s flat it was green. The \u201Cbio\u201D bucket was sometimes brown and sometimes\
  \ black. \u201CRestm\xFCll\u201D (general waste, or what I dubbed simply \u201C\
  the rest\u201D) seemed to transcend any rules; I\u2019d seen black, gray, red, and\
  \ green receptacles. At least yellow was pretty standard for \u201Cpackaging,\u201D\
  \ but then the question became, \u201CWhat exactly is packaging?\u201D \n\nBecause\
  \ once you\u2019d figured out what each color signified, your journey was just beginning.\
  \ \u201CPackaging\u201D could be anything from an empty waxed milk carton to the\
  \ metal can formerly holding your beans. Even the plastic window of a business envelope\
  \ went in there (but not the paper part, which belonged in the blue bin, of course).\
  \ And don\u2019t forget, if said packaging was too soiled with food residue, the\
  \ proper place was Restm\xFCll.\n\nThe system even seemed confusing for my German\
  \ friends. I read somewhere that paper napkins and paper towels could go in the\
  \ bio bin with the coffee grounds and eggshells, but Elfi assured me that they should\
  \ never be put in there; they should go in Restm\xFCll. Still later, my friend Paul\
  \ insisted they belong in Paper/Cardboard, shaking his head at me as if it were\
  \ obvious. \n\nThe thing is, though, the approach seems to be working. Germany consistently\
  \ has one of the lowest landfill volumes in the EU. The government encourages consumers\
  \ to do their part, and I tried to do mine. Small steps I took during my time in\
  \ Leipzig (bringing my own shopping bags, favoring products with less packaging\
  \ over those with more) still inform my life today. Of all the cultural differences\
  \ I imagined I\u2019d encounter living in Germany for five months, sorting the trash\
  \ was so far from something I expected that I didn\u2019t even consider it. It did\
  \ take me awhile, but I eventually got the hang of the process\u2026although napkins\
  \ and paper towels still confound me."
