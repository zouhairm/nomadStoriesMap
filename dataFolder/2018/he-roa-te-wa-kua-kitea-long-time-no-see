Text: "As I sat perched on the edge of the thermal waters of the Otamuheke stream,\
  \ with the warm water soothing away the aches and pains of a treacherous 25 km hike,\
  \ I thought to myself \"I recognise that guy sat across me on the other side of\
  \ the stream\".  Jet-black hair, broad-shouldered and the same fearsome grin that\
  \ haunted me for 80 minutes twice a season in my younger years.\n\nAs time passed\
  \ by and with sunset drawing ever closer, I knew I had to let my curiosity and instinct\
  \ get the better of me. Edging closer to the other side of the stream and with a\
  \ slight ounce of trepidation, I took a deep breath and shouted \"RICKI\". What\
  \ followed was a brief moment of silence, an inquisitive look similar to the one\
  \ you get from entering a field of cows and a feeling of disappointment that Ricki\
  \ wasn't the guy on the other side of the stream.\n\nSuddenly a bellowing laugh\
  \ erupted and back came the fearsome grin a remembered so vividly \"Kia Ora Ollie,\
  \ you thought I didn't recognise you ay\" replied Ricki. I replied with letting\
  \ him know I was shocked, this was a guy I had become friends with from playing\
  \ junior rugby North Yorkshire and here we were thousands of miles away in a geothermal\
  \ stream meeting again after 12 years. As we took a seat on the embankment Ricki\
  \ let out a brief cackle and asked \"So what brings you to my hometown (he originated\
  \ from Taupo and is of Maori descent). \"The diverse landscapes, the calming way\
  \ of life but most of all the history of the Maori people\" I explained. Mid-way\
  \ through our conversation, Ricki stopped me and said \"Ollie, I've got just the\
  \ thing for you, 8 pm tonight outside the hostel, see you there\". I couldn't help\
  \ but wonder what to expect however what was to follow was one of the best and most\
  \ insightful nights of my life.\n\nRicki was taking me to the Maori experience and\
  \ going with a local made the experience all the more worthwhile. From the meaning\
  \ behind the performance rituals to the paintings and crafts, Ricki treated me to\
  \ a detailed understanding of the Maori way of life. It enabled me to gain a true\
  \ appreciation of their values and way of living. \n\nThe day ended with a traditional\
  \ Maori cooked dinner or 'Hangi', steam-cooked 10ft below the ground, the colours\
  \ resembled a Picasso canvas and the flavours were tantalizing. Ricki turned to\
  \ me and said \"Kei mai koe\" meaning 'you're welcome' and that was a true reflection\
  \ of the Maori people and my first experience of their culture, welcoming, warm\
  \ and insightful."
