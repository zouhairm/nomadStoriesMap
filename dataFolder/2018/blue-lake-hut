Text: "This is a tale of my stubbornness, wanderlust and surprise as I did my first\
  \ multi day semi-alpine hike, alone in the land of the long white cloud. To reach\
  \ the Blue Lake Hut. In Nelson Lakes Nation Park.\n\nI will start my tale on the\
  \ morning of day 2 where I woke up early to re-embark on my journey, which happened\
  \ to be an alpine traverse and then the push to Blue Lake hut. Little did I know\
  \ though that this hike would be the most physically and mentally taxing experience\
  \ I had yet to accomplish. Firstly within an hour of me walking it started to rain\
  \ and rain some more. To make it worse it started sleeting combined with gale-force\
  \ wind that burnt my face, while I dragged my soaked and freezing body over the\
  \ traverse and then tried unsuccessfully not to slide and fall down most of the\
  \ decline. I walked through the pouring rain foolishly passing a hut I could have\
  \ stopped at and only stopping again, when I met a fellow hiker coming from the\
  \ direction of the blue lake. We spoke for a brief seconds and he told me in no\
  \ uncertain words; how far it was, that no one was there and the wood for a fire\
  \ was wet so the hut wouldn't have heat. I thanked him for his news, turned and\
  \ carried on towards the hut in-spite of his warning, blinded by stubbornness, which\
  \ meant walking into the night. \n\nAs it got darker, I got more tired and I found\
  \ myself tripping and falling over everything. My breaking point was when I came\
  \ to a flash waterfall that I had to wade hip-deep across and as I precariously\
  \ splashed through it I started to cry. I was scared in the dark and tired of being\
  \ alone. I sobbed even harder as came to another steep hill I had to scramble up.\
  \ I pulled my poor tired legs one at a time up each rocky step, and tried with all\
  \ my might to see the reflective trail beckons through the rain and sobs. I even\
  \ considered sleeping in a cave I sore along the way. \nAll of a sudden my heart\
  \ sang, as I reached the top of the hill and sore the silhouette of the blue lake\
  \ hut in front of me with, to my surprise!, smoke billowing out of the chimney.\
  \ A sight I did not expect to see in a million years. \n\nInside was the kindest\
  \ Belgian man named Oliver who was equally surprised to see me. He fed me cookies\
  \ helped me get warm and dry and I fell asleep that night feeling blessed. What\
  \ made everything worth it was seeing the blue lake the next morning. It had snowed\
  \ that night and the turquoise blue water was framed in white. A vision that will\
  \ be imprinted on my mind for ever."
