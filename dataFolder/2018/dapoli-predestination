Text: "\u201CYou\u2019re the first Westerners I\u2019ve seen around here in fifteen\
  \ years,\u201D Varad says. He speaks impeccable English accented with a Mumbaikar\u2019\
  s lilting consonants.\n\nWe\u2019re squeezed into an unassuming restaurant in Dapoli,\
  \ some 200 plus kilometres south of Mumbai. Fans whir noisily overhead. Waiters\
  \ rush by, faintly smelling of fenugreek. Thankfully Varad orders for us in Marathi.\
  \ We had met at the bus terminal fifteen minutes earlier, following a journey along\
  \ the axel-shattering, bone-crunching roads of the Konkan coast.\n\nOver fat prawns\
  \ laced with tamarind and chilli, Varad tells us he was born here but now lives\
  \ in Mumbai. He\u2019s a corporate lawyer and to our mutual delight, we learn that\
  \ he attended the same university as my friend\u2019s father.\n\nI\u2019m enjoying\
  \ the satisfaction of eating with my hands; tearing apart my chapatti, dousing it\
  \ in the tangy dishes. Varad mentions his Doctorate in the Occult Sciences.\n\n\
  I nearly choke on my perfectly crisped kingfish. The Occult?\n\nVarad explains that\
  \ he\u2019s a Sanskrit scholar, self-taught. For years, he has pored over the Vedas\
  \ - Hinduism\u2019s ancient scriptures that date back to 1500 BC.\n\nHis fingertips\
  \ form a pyramid above the table. We cover astronomy, astrology, medicine and the\
  \ phenomenon of twins, as Varad shows the Occult to be minutely scientific. The\
  \ conversation flows as easily as the Arabian sea 20 kilometres away.\n\n\u201C\
  The sages knew it all, from the position of the sun. You can even begin to predict\
  \ events.\u201D \n\nSeeing my incredulity, he points to a neat scar above his right\
  \ eyebrow.\n\n\u201CI knew I would sustain a head injury. I did not leave the house\
  \ that month until I received an emergency call from a friend in hospital.\u201D\
  \n\nAs foretold, he did hit his head. Varad is convinced his precautions prevented\
  \ any real harm. His words are engrossing yet the scientist in me needs rationalism.\n\
  \n\u201CAh, but that is the occult. It cannot be explained. One must directly experience\
  \ it to understand,\u201D Varad finishes, inclining his chin to one side \u2013\
  \ the most charming of Indian gestures.\n\nIt\u2019s a privilege to receive his\
  \ knowledge of India\u2019s extraordinary spiritual essence. It\u2019s certainly\
  \ a conversation I\u2019m never going to forget. He is a man of contradictions:\
  \ inquisitive and reserved, mystic and lawyer, old soul and modern man. But Varad\
  \ refuses divisions. He believes in oneness \u2013 of people, of the Universe. In\
  \ Om.\n\nSipping my chai, my scepticism softens. Varad is unexpected, illuminating.\n\
  \nWas our meeting purely chance after all?"
