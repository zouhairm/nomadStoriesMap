Text: "\xABYou have to go there, Peter!\xBB \u2013 a voice in my head was disturbing\
  \ my sleep every night. \n-What does it mean? \u2013 I was trying to understand,\
  \ but unsuccessfully. \n-Hm. Amazon rainforest is not a bad idea. I can take pictures\
  \ of charming orchids. Oh yes! So I started the journey.\nThe village where I\u2019\
  ve found the house to stay, was located near the mouth of the Amazon river, so I\
  \ saw the ocean from the east coast. A strange worrying began to cover my heart.\
  \ This place seemed so familiar to me. But it was only for a minute. \n-No, no i\
  \ couldn\u2019t be there before! \nI calmed down and started my way to the dark\
  \ jaw of jungles.  \n-Wow! Such a pretty orchid! Oh, but it grows so high. Hm, I\
  \ have to take a picture. It will be the queen of my collection!\nTree\u2019s branches\
  \ in this place were thick and tangled but they looked like lianas stairs.\n \u2013\
  God helps me \u2013I thought.\nI passed half of the way to orchid but suddenly something\
  \ fell from the tree and threw me down. \n\xABA strong shake! Panic! Baby\u2019\
  s crying!  Oh no, we are falling! We will die!..Ocean coast... Fire. Fragments of\
  \ the plane.Mum!!\xBB\nA minute and I came to consciousness. I couldn\u2019t move.\
  \ A big tough net covered my body. Half-naked, tanned savages jumped around and\
  \ stared at me. They were pointing at me, then to the trees where I\u2019ve climbed,\
  \ They exclaimed some sounds or words (I couldn\u2019t understand).  \n-What\u2019\
  s going on? Why did you trapped me? \u2013 I asked quietly.\n I looked more attentively\
  \ on the tree, they were pointing at. \n-Oh God, that\u2019s their house! Oh no!\
  \ They thought I wanted to ruin it. No!- I was trying to show them that I\u2019\
  m just a tourist. But they didn\u2019t believe me.. \nSuddenly I\u2019ve heard the\
  \ noise behind my back. And all the savages fell to the knees. Then i saw a woman,\
  \ not young but still strong and beautiful. There were some power and domination\
  \ in her eyes. \n \xABShe is their queen\xBB- I thought. \nShe looked at me and\
  \ I caught her eye. We were staring at each other for a minute. Then she said something\
  \ to the savages and they started to search my back. They shook my passport. A small\
  \ photo of a beautiful woman fell to the ground. \n-No, don\u2019t touch it! That\u2019\
  s the only thing I have from my mum! - I almost cried. A women took the photo and\
  \ looked at it.\n -It\u2019s me!- she whispered in English. \n-What? \u2013 I asked.\
  \ \nHer eyes were full of tears. \n-Yes, Peter!- she exclaimed.\n-Mum!! Oh! \n-The\
  \ plane.. Panic.. Crash! Oh, now i understand. They said you have died, mum!- I\
  \ cried.\n-I\u2019m alive dear! - She fell into my arms!"
