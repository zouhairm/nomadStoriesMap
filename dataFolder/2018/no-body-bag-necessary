Text: "Our tour guide Peter (evidently not his Chinese name) flipped open his phone\
  \ and punched in a number. Just like that, our suggestion turned into a plan.  By\
  \ the time our minivan arrived at Tieneman Square, a strong Tibetan man and a wheelchair\
  \ were waiting for us.  We were at the end of a two-week tour in China and my 79-year-old\
  \ father\u2019s heart was playing up. This was his trip.  My sister and I accompanied\
  \ him in case we needed to bring him back in a body bag. His angina meant he struggled\
  \ for breath and he did not have the stamina to walk any distance.  Instead, our\
  \ guide\u2019s local connection was able to wheel Dad through the square and the\
  \ neighbouring Forbidden City with ease. \n\nPeter was a charming guide and rather\
  \ patient.  He willingly sat with Dad sipping tea, while my sister and I bartered\
  \ our way up and down the markets.  My father did his convincing best to persuade\
  \ Peter that capitalism was superior to communism.  Peter would explain the exceptions\
  \ to the one-child policy and share a little about his rural upbringing.  He came\
  \ to Beijing for the promise of wealth along with the Olympic Games.  His business\
  \ bankrupted, so here he was being a tour guide to Aussies, like us. \n\nHe would\
  \ take us to the most accessible part of the Great Wall, just so Dad could touch\
  \ it.  That was all my father was capable of at the end of the tour.  Peter again,\
  \ willingly sat sipping tea with Dad.  This time my sister and I would climb up\
  \ and down a section of China\u2019s Great Wall, while Dad rested. \n \nFor three\
  \ days, Peter accompanied us and a driver in a minivan around Beijing.  He was very\
  \ gracious, very accommodating and I felt, very scripted.  So much of what he shared\
  \ about his country, sounded like the billboards and the brochures promoting the\
  \ progressiveness of his nation.  Unlike our free speaking guide in Shanghai, Peter\
  \ was careful with what he said.  \n\nThis final leg of our China adventure, would\
  \ not have been possible without our English-speaking local guide. His respect for\
  \ the elderly and the honor he bestowed on our father, ensured our Dad\u2019s final\
  \ overseas holiday was memorable and achievable.  Dad returned home to Australia\
  \ economy class, just as he had left.  No body bag necessary.  I have no doubt our\
  \ local connection played no small part in ensuring our father survived his final\
  \ oriental holiday. (Dad would pass away 3 months later, still talking about Peter.)"
