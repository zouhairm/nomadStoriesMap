Text: "When you get to a new place, where you don\u2019t know anybody, it seems that\
  \ you don\u2019t know who you are anymore. It seems that your environment, things\
  \ and habits make you what you are. When they disappear, you feel lost. No references,\
  \ nothing familiar. It\u2019s like a different life.  \nI was walking when I suddenly\
  \ heard: \u2018Italiano!\u2019. Filippo and Fatima are beach boys and they stop\
  \ foreigners in order to provide them with any service or souvenirs they need. They\
  \ proposed a tour of their villages. It was June, two months before the Kenyan General\
  \ Elections and the whole country was unstable, with rumours of Somalian Al-Shabaab\
  \ militiamen controlling the Northern Coast around Lamu hijacking cars and kidnapping\
  \ people. Apparently Malindi was safe, but I felt guilty when I hesitated to accept\
  \ their offer to take me to the muslim village of Shela. Eventually I followed Fatima\
  \ and she introduced me to her mother Amina and younger sister Tima, who was supposed\
  \ to become my wife shortly. They didn\u2019t really ask me if I wanted to marry\
  \ her; they just said I\u2019d do it. After a couple of hours, I paid them for their\
  \ tour, I accepted to meet them on the next day and I left. \nI thought a lot that\
  \ night from my little room, I found my experience in Shela amazing. It had been\
  \ so real and authentic in its simplicity. No filters, no mediators. But why did\
  \ I realize about it only later in my room? Why not on the spot? Why always that\
  \ perception of insecurity and mistrust?\nOn the second day, I joined Filippo and\
  \ Fatima in the morning. We started walking towards Filippo\u2019s village, Muyeye.\
  \ That\u2019s when I found out that they were part of two different tribes:  Filippo\
  \ was a Giriama (Christian), Fatima was a Bajuni (Muslim). Muyeye was great; we\
  \ visited some local projects, met lovely people and had good chapati, coconut and\
  \ beans. It was totally different from Shela and I felt blessed for having experienced\
  \ opposite views on religion, social issues and relationships in two villages next\
  \ to each other. \nI knew I hadn\u2019t been irresponsible. I was aware of where\
  \ I was and of the political and cultural issues involved, but I forced myself to\
  \ trust those people and I got incredible experiences and emotions in return. These\
  \ were my thoughts of the sleepless night when I designed the idea of my new business:\
  \ a tour operator which \u2018travels people\u2019 more than places, proposes slow\
  \ trips to enjoy authenticity, smell the roses, fulfill our senses and appreciate\
  \ differences. We trust people."
