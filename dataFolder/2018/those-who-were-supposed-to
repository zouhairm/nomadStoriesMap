Text: "Eyes wide open.  Was dark enough to make me comfortable. I felt the ground\
  \ under my fingers and fresh air within my nostril but I did not hear sounds surrounding\
  \ me, so I decided to find one. My little feet, painful over the arid soil, did\
  \ not stop until a draping of light colour appeared. It looked at me and I looked\
  \ into it. It saw a little girl and I saw three men within. \u2018Field Marshall,\
  \ didn\u2019t anybody tell her?\u2019 laughed one drinking from the bottle, \u2018\
  I do not know, my dear General, didn\u2019t anybody see?\u2019 replied the other\
  \ with more laughs and bigger sips. \nI was tempted to go inside the tent and ask\
  \ for my mother but I stood there outside, I was scared by them. There was something\
  \ in the way they laughed, they were so carelessly, insanely happy.\nThey wore funny\
  \ clothes with lots of metal stars and red stripes and they had huge moustaches;\
  \ they constantly touched them with their enormous and dirty hands, smoothed them,\
  \ combed them as if they were the thing they most held to. \n\u2018She said she\u2019\
  d always been a dancer\u2019 I heard the third one say, he was not laughing but\
  \ his eyes were while he was standing up holding a pen. He was the youngest but\
  \ seemed the oldest, though. An image of those dirty black fingers intent on strangle\
  \ me crossed my mind.\nIn the centre of the tent there was a wooden table with a\
  \ big paper on it halted by two stones. He was drawing lines while he was talking\
  \ about this \u2018young and hot chick, ruined by the colour of her mind\u2019;\
  \ I felt so hard the desire of having a mind repellent for them and I decided to\
  \ go find my colour.\nI started to walk followed by their grisly smell and I touched\
  \ my belly, feeling aversion. \nOne little feet in front of the other, one scary\
  \ face in front of the other. Their facial features overlapped in one huge laughing\
  \ expression. \nI bent down my head, I needed to find my colour and that thought\
  \ kept my little feet walking. One in front of the other as was beginning to dawn.\
  \ The drawing from the tent appeared, figures on it were surrounded by blue and\
  \ cut inside by fresh, black lines. Suddenly I heard someone behind me, I turn around\
  \ terrified, they were smiling.\nThe younger one approached and bent; his breath\
  \ was warm and tasted like something sour.\nHe drew a horizontal line between our\
  \ feet and answering my questioning gaze he replied:\n\u2018We are those who are\
  \ in charge of drawing lines, we are those who are destined to connect the world\
  \ and as you can see, you are on the other side\u2019."
