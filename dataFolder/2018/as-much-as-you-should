Text: "We had the same birthday. Two years apart. She was the kinder, harder working,\
  \ better at getting along with everyone, better at being a good friend and better\
  \ at being present half of our whole. Looking out my window on our way to Dublin,\
  \ I still couldn\u2019t understand why she never got to see this side of the world.\
  \ Why her. Why not me? When we got to UCD I ran around the airport, in awe. At the\
  \ edge of the Cliffs of Moher, in the fields of the Powers Court Estate, I felt\
  \ alive. The open fields reminded me of something familiar. The next day in County\
  \ Cork, in a coffee shop and an older gentlemen came up behind me and whispered\
  \ to me and said \u201Cyour heart is gold and all you love will find you again,\
  \ bigger and brighter, May God bless you\u201D. I left America, spent two weeks\
  \ defending it to the Irish and I let this small country across the world see me\
  \ and see how much I was hurting. And that\u2019s when I realized to the outside\
  \ world, my brokenness was humanizing. It was attractive and magnetic. My ability\
  \ to feel and to be moved brought people towards me, not away. To be understood\
  \ across the world, that changed me. That sent me home feeling like I\u2019d be\
  \ all right. That moment, and those words, that broke me down much like the reminders\
  \ of April of 2013, they taught me something about grief, and pain, and people that\
  \ I didn\u2019t believe anymore. When she died, I felt like the one connection to\
  \ myself I had in the outside world was gone. I felt like I ran out of time. I felt\
  \ like her Army recruiter had killed the only person who appreciated me. And I was\
  \ right. They seem completely separate when you write them down, without the word\
  \ death, but in a coffee shop, so far away from home, someone saw in me, the truth.\
  \ Life and death, grief and joy are meant to exist beside one another. And I feel\
  \ like we don\u2019t hear that as much as we should."
