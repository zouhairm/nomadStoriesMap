Text: "I looked down the rough auburn track we were driving down, either side branches\
  \ of green were supporting us on our way.  Winding around the corner at the end\
  \ of the road we pulled into a clearing, past a row of trees.  There sitting nestled\
  \ beside a patch of farmland, in the middle of nowhere was the local hall.  \n\n\
  Arriving through the door of the Lorne Hall, not far from Charlottetown, PEI we\
  \ were greeted into a neat square room with chairs placed round the edges waiting\
  \ in anticipation for locals to pour in for the weekly square dance.  \n\n\u201C\
  Let\u2019s get the piano and sound system set up\u201D Keith said to me.  After\
  \ just meeting a few hours ago and sharing a beer, we had come up with a rough plan\
  \ for sharing, and teaching each other fiddle tunes from our local areas.\n\n\u201C\
  No problem, let me know if you would like me to play a few Scottish tunes this evening\
  \ for the dancers.\u201D I said to Keith.\n\n\u201CExcellent! Just play loads of\
  \ reels at the same tempo and that will do it.  We tend to get every fiddle player\
  \ taking a turn later on in the night\u201D\n\nA bus load of American tourists rolled\
  \ up and descended on the tranquil hall.  Regular locals began arriving to their\
  \ usual much anticipated dance night.    The pop of the mic into the speakers and\
  \ the bowed chord of the fiddle player saw the musicians spark into life with lively\
  \ jigs tunefully beating through the sound system.  \n\n\u201CWould you like to\
  \ dance?  With you being a Scottish lass you\u2019re bound to get the hang of the\
  \ dance in no time\u201D Old Norman asked me, from the farm across the road.\n\n\
  Before the end of the night almost every fiddle player in the room had a turn of\
  \ playing for the dancers.  What a treat to see how important traditional music\
  \ was in the Maritime province.  \n\n\u201CWill you be coming along to the Fiddle\
  \ Festival next week\u201D Keith was wondering.  \u201CIt\u2019s the highlight of\
  \ the year for everyone here!\u201D\n\n\u201CNot yet planned to stay as long, but\
  \ you know what?  I think I will look into extending my visit\u201D  \n\n\u201C\
  Great, in that case we will be able to take you kayaking down the valley, and you\
  \ can come along to the local session in the pub this Thursday right?\u201D\n\n\
  The dancers had become exhausted, tunes faded out and the crowd slowly dispersed\
  \ in the early hours of the morning.  We made the drive back to Charlottetown down\
  \ the rusty dirt track road, still glowing despite the midsummer evening light.\
  \  \n\n\u201CSo, we have a Japanese fiddle player joining us on the island.  Tunes\
  \ tomorrow?\u201D\n\nI had never felt more at home."
