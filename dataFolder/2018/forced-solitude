Text: "As I looked at the sign that indicated the start of a section of the Pacific\
  \ Crest Trail I could practically hear the Indiana Jones music. I could see my six\
  \ months training unfolding into this big adventure, me and my fifty pound backpack,\
  \ all alone in the wild, sleeping under the stars. I could picture the awed expressions\
  \ and endless questions I would answer after my triumphant return, the book I would\
  \ write, the carreer I would start. As usual, I pictured the end of the journey\
  \ before taking my first step and I think it\u2019s where it all went wrong.\n Like\
  \ most people who decide to jump headfirst into danger and discomfort, I was bored.\
  \ Bored with my repetitive work, with my lack of drive, with my past trips, with\
  \ myself. I didn\u2019t want to face the things I would have to do at home to change\
  \ where my life was heading, so I decided to physically head somewhere else. The\
  \ Pacific Crest Trail, a path that streches from the border of Mexico all the way\
  \ to Canada seemed like a perfect destination. \n I didn\u2019t have six months\
  \ to attempt the entirety of it, so I picked a stretch I could do in one: from just\
  \ below the south border of Washington back home to Canada. I trained for months\
  \ before the big adventure. I was commited to this. It would be the spark that lit\
  \ the fire of my new life. I was looking forward to being alone and having that\
  \ burst of inspiration, of newfound love for life that these adventures give people\
  \ in the books and movies I devour.\n The beauty and novelty of that first day soon\
  \ gave way to the realization that I saw row after row of identical green trees\
  \ for hours as I walked and walked and walked. This would be it, I would be doing\
  \ exactly this for thirty days and all I would have for company would be my thoughts.\n\
  \ I burst into tears. I cried for hours, cried until I had to stop for fear my blurry\
  \ eyes would send me walking off a cliff. I sobbed into my hands, wiped my eyes\
  \ still holding my walking sticks and realized, in that moment, that there is a\
  \ very big difference between chosen and forced solitude. I had toned my legs, lost\
  \ weight, prepared my body to carry that pack, but I hadn\u2019t prepared my spirit\
  \ to carry the crushing weight of the silence I once found so beautiful, the peace\
  \ of the woods now more oppressive than anything I had ever faced. \n After two\
  \ days I gave up. My body would have carried me to the moon and back, but the last\
  \ thing I expected was that the scariest thing in those endless, beautiful woods\
  \ would be my mind."
