Text: "We had water. A lot of water. In the sky, on the floor, around us, around me.\
  \ We were playing in a lake. Some people pushing others, mud covering our heads\
  \ coming from a mud war (why is it so fun?! I love it!) and sand under our feet.\
  \ Probable it still there. The same lake, same sand, same people. Same energy. Same\
  \ fluid. That fluid made me feel blessed, makes me feel embraced by nature all around.\
  \ By all stories that I heard, the celebrations and traditions that I was seeing.\n\
  \nWhen I was younger I went in a Brazilian indian tribe, the Patax\xF3s, during\
  \ the Water\u2019s Party, or in portuguese \u2018Festa das \xC1guas\u2019. The Patax\xF3\
  s living in two different brazilian states: Bahia and Minas Gerais. As I live in\
  \ the capital of Minas, Belo Horizonte, I went to the village called Carm\xE9sia,\
  \ because is the closest to my town. There have a small Patax\xF3 village and have\
  \ more six Patax\xF3 communities in these two states and all of them celebrate this\
  \ event on October.\n\nI was there with my school in 2011 and we had a few days\
  \ to explore, to inspire, be inspired by them and to learn with them. To share experiences\
  \ and enjoy all games, culture and food.\n\nWas only my first day at that beautiful\
  \ village. We arrived in Patax\xF3s at lunch and they prepared for us a huge welcome\
  \ party. We saw they dancing and we dancing together, we ate their delicious food\
  \ and shared stories and histories in a circle. All this day was raining. Could\
  \ be better? Is a Water\u2019s Party and was raining! Amazing.\n\nWell\u2026 this\
  \ natural cause did not affect their souls and bodies, neither ours. After we ate,\
  \ danced and sang, the ritual begun even we didn't know that yet. The blessing (or\
  \ \u2018baptism\u2019)  started when someone pass mud in the others and everybody\
  \ begun to run and we went to the rain. The amount of mud began to grow in people\u2019\
  s hand and everyone was very dirty.  Suddenly the indians start loading people and\
  \ threw them into the lake! What a great surprise!\n\nI spent four days there and\
  \ along all these days I got great surprises and amazing experiences. Our experience\
  \ was so intense, true and pure!\nIn the past not only Patax\xF3s but all indians\
  \ suffered a lot of barbaries (and still suffering these days) and see these people\
  \ trying rediscover your own identity and about your past as well was magical. People\
  \ who makes me feel like them. There was no gender, color or nationality distinction.\
  \ Was a terrific celebration. I could feel it. I could taste it. I could smell it.\
  \ In my body, in my bones, in my ancestry."
