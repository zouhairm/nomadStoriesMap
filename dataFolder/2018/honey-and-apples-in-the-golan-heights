Text: "From the window of the van, I could see the snow-capped precipices of Mount\
  \ Hermon. Ascending the mountain, 500m, 1000m high, we finally reached the Golan\
  \ Heights. The van doors creaked open with a less than gentle push, and immediately,\
  \ a pounding wind greeted my bare face.\nEagerly, although with a fervent desire\
  \ to be back in the warmth, I shuffled higher up. Standing amidst the snow, I gradually\
  \ processed the panoramic view of my surroundings. The point where Israel, Syria\
  \ and Jordan meet.\nDespite the treacherous winds, there was a simple serenity in\
  \ the surroundings. \nUntil I heard bombs in the distance. \nInstantly, the cloud\
  \ of tranquillity evaporated. I was forced to consider the realities of where I\
  \ was standing. Something that had barely crossed my mind on the drive up; that\
  \ warfare was closer to my vicinity than it had ever been before. Not on the news.\
  \ Or in an article on the internet. And I was standing on territory that had been\
  \ disputed for decades, centuries even.\nMeanwhile, I was witnessing UN soldiers\
  \ wandering around the top of the mountain, smiling and taking pictures with tourists,\
  \ being silly, putting their sunglasses on strangers. \nUnsurprisingly, there was\
  \ a strange feeling in recognising the dichotomy between the two locations.\nWith\
  \ tourists scuttling past, having snowball fights, and a family attempting to sled,\
  \ I came across a man selling honey and apples at the entrance of the car park.\
  \ Without much prompting, he readily began sharing his life story. He was originally\
  \ a maths professor from one of the best universities in Syria. After losing his\
  \ job due to the warfare, he crossed the border and was now a travelling salesman,\
  \ of sorts, with his folding table filled with food products, from fruits to jars\
  \ of honey and jam. \nWithout dwelling much on the topic of politics, or how his\
  \ life and family had been drastically affected, he gleefully shared how much he\
  \ had learnt from interacting with tourists in his new job. He pointed to his products:\
  \ \u201Cmanzana, \u044F\u0431\u043B\u043E\u043A\u043E, pomme\u201D. Rattling off\
  \ flavours of jam, too, he said, \u201Ccereza\u201D in Spanish, \u201Cabricot\u201D\
  \ in French, \u201Cfragola\u201D in Italian.\nAs I sampled a freshly cut apple dipped\
  \ in a golden, thick honey, he became insistent on teaching me some tips and tricks\
  \ for mathematics, quickly rattling off a shortcut for how to work out the square\
  \ root of any number. Once a maths teacher, always a maths teacher, I suppose. \n\
  In our short interaction, I met a sweet man, and left with the tastiest apples."
