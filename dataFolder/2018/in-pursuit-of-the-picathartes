Text: "Love can take you in many directions.\nIncluding, it seems, to a parched corner\
  \ of Sierra Leone\u2019s only golf course at 6am on a Sunday. I have just started\
  \ dating a blue-eyed South African. Since I am also 22, I have yet to learn that\
  \ you can love someone without loving their hobbies.\nWhich means I am now a devoted\
  \ birdwatcher. I am learning that not all birds that soar and wheedle over the dug-out\
  \ canoes that speckle the ocean are seagulls, that sunbirds sing most beautifully\
  \ in the first silent minutes after a June rainstorm, and that the ducking and diving\
  \ of the stiff-winged swift provokes an answering swoop in my own stomach.\nThe\
  \ avian holy grail, however, is the Picathartes. This incredibly rare bird looks\
  \ like a rather startled anorexic pheasant made of black plasticine, but fortunately\
  \ love is blind. We search for it whenever we can, slotting our limbs like pieces\
  \ of a jigsaw into the over-crowded minibuses that wend their way outwards from\
  \ the laughing, colourful streets of Freetown.\nOne journey brings us to the Liberian\
  \ border, just as the sun is rising. Even at this hour the thick, dark forest pulses\
  \ with heat, and a miasma of leaf-mould permeates every thought. Each branch hides\
  \ vicious thorns, and as we stoop to wait under a boulder the cool moss soothes\
  \ the ragged skin of my fingers.\nThe hours inch past. We see nothing. This may\
  \ be due to our guide, Kenneth, who periodically brings his flip-flop down with\
  \ a resounding THWACK on some tree trunk or body part, before pausing to admire\
  \ whatever vaguely insect-shaped smudge he has created. My boyfriend bristles, and\
  \ gives Kenneth a small leafy branch instead of the flipflop. Kenneth is delighted.\
  \ He ties it so that when he launches his next attack it makes an enormously loud\
  \ whipping WHOMP.\nThis, it seems, is the entrance music our quarry has been waiting\
  \ for. She is unmistakable, even at 50 feet. Her yellow head bobs in what is left\
  \ of the evening light, and she hops from rock to rock cocking her neck thoughtfully,\
  \ before disappearing off into the gloaming. We stay seated, frozen in reverent\
  \ silence. I am struck by the idea that to this bird I am just another animal\u2014\
  another crooked stitch in the enormous rambling tapestry of the natural world. It\
  \ is, surprisingly, a good feeling.\nThis is followed swift by another, smugger\
  \ thought: I am clearly a better birdwatcher than David Attenborough, who had to\
  \ wait until he was 28 to encounter the Picathartes. I\u2019m expecting a call from\
  \ the BBC any minute now\u2026"
