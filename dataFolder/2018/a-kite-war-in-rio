Text: "I approached the swaying palm trees, pebbled paths and exotic plants and understood\
  \ how countless Bossanova songs were written here. The Botanical Gardens of Ipanema\
  \ breathed music. Mike was lying on a cement bench, face up toward the sky and a\
  \ hum of happiness traveled up my chest. I wanted to stay all day \u2013 but we\
  \ were here for a reason. He finally collected all the paperwork needed to move\
  \ back to the U.S. with his Brazilian wife. It was time to celebrate.\n\nWe embarked\
  \ toward Copacabana and saw a group of children flying kites and I smiled. Mike\
  \ explained, \"They're playing kite wars...they dip the string in glue and then\
  \ in crushed glass...then try to cut each other\u2019s kites down.\u201D He laughed.\
  \ I smiled and looked hopeful towards the ocean.\n\nI could hear waves crashing\
  \ but we were surrounded by concrete structures, stained, dark and wet. Children\
  \ ran about and suddenly a swarm of them buzzed around Mike. Just as quickly, they\
  \ disappeared. Baffled, I asked, \u201Cwhat just happened?\u201D He looked at me\
  \ deadpan, \u201CThey took my backpack\u201D.\n\nHe had spent years navigating the\
  \ bureaucratic Brazilian government and now all those documents were gone. Even\
  \ worse, he said he felt something against his back \u2013 it could have been a\
  \ gun. I froze. I wanted to leave, preferably run. But Mike, would not leave. Like\
  \ a hero before a shootout, he said voice low and gravelly, \u201CI\u2019m going\
  \ back\u201D.\n\nMike was fluent in Portuguese but more importantly he understood\
  \ the culture. Through his many stories, I learned that Brazilians could be both\
  \ charming and dangerous. When he walked back into the ghetto, he moved slowly,\
  \ smiling and carefully spoke to a group of children. He told them about the backpack,\
  \ of his Brazilian wife and his dream to give her a better life.\n\nThe kids nodded.\
  \ They knew that dream. He said, there was nothing in that backpack for them \u2013\
  \ no money \u2013 nothing except his wife's future. He asked them, \u201CImagine\
  \ if this were you?\u201D They listened wide-eyed. His words touched their hearts.\
  \ They understood. Collectively, the group turned to Mike and pointed to the bushes.\n\
  \nHe walked over, his tense shoulders let out a deep sigh. His backpack was there\
  \ with everything still inside. He grabbed it, turned around and murmured, \"Obrigado\"\
  . The kids were thankful too and waved as he quickly walked away. Without stopping,\
  \ he said to me \"let's go\". We raced toward the sea and he told me the whole story,\
  \ ending with a wry smile, \"the funny thing is, I've had $50 in my shoe this whole\
  \ time\"."
