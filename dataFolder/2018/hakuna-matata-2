Text: "I had just met this guy, two or three months earlier, when he popped the question:\
  \ would you climb Mount Kilimanjaro with me?\n\nI was always fascinate with the\
  \ idea of hiking, mountains and waterfalls around you, fresh air, but had little\
  \ to none experience in this area.\n\nThat seemed like the company I needed to shake\
  \ off the \u201Csomeday I will\u201D attitude of me. Later it would be clear that\
  \ we were falling in love and he would become my partner in crime in everything\
  \ to come, but back then going to Africa with an almost stranger did not sound well.\
  \  \n\nThen, the answer was brought to me as work assignment: a motivational lecture\
  \ was schedule on the bank I worked with one of the most known climbers from Brazil.\
  \ \nHis love for mountains ever since he was a little boy, the travels all over\
  \ the word searching for new heights, the many times he climbed Everest and, of\
  \ course, pictures taken on Uhuru peak, the top of Kilimanjaro. It was my obligation\
  \ to go.\n\nI wish I could say what followed was the most amazing preparation, mental\
  \ and physical, for the journey to come. But I\u2019m not this exemplar person.\
  \ There wasn\u2019t even enough time.\n\nKids, don\u2019t do this at home.\n\nBut\
  \ what followed was one of the most intense experiences in my life. Not only I went\
  \ along with the idea, but I arrived in Tanzania before the rest of the group and\
  \ did a four day safari before the main adventure.\n\nClimbing Kilimanjaro is a\
  \ lesson of humility before nature. It is not one of the hardest climbs, but you\
  \ have to respect it. And respect yourself. It was a journey inside myself and of\
  \ self knowledge.\nThe knowledge to know that the day after I\u2019ll be cursing\
  \ myself for making these choices. The pain, the frustrations. And on the second\
  \ day I\u2019ll be missing every minute. The feeling of conquest, achievement, the\
  \ relief crying.\n\nToday I can say that not only about Kili, but for so many other\
  \ mountains I had the privilege to reach.\n\nEver since, whenever I\u2019m out of\
  \ my comfort zone, possibly in a far away place, I close my eyes and picture this\
  \ zoom out from where I am to where I am from. It is my way of seeing literally\
  \ and emotionally how far I\u2019ve come.\n\nI am still just a banker, sitting on\
  \ a desk for 8 hours a day. But I am also so much more."
