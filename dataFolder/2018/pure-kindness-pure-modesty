Text: "Last June, my aunt, my mother and I we went to discover Tuscany and its amazing\
  \ landscapes and delicious food. As some of you may have already done in the past,\
  \ I fell in love with Cinque Terre and later, I cheated on her with a lovely muse\
  \ called Lucca. Just when the trip was a midsummer night's dream we had a car crash\
  \ on our way to Firenze. And this is when it turned into a nightmare.\n\nWhile we\
  \ were in the middle of a traffic jam, a medium-size truck decided that driving\
  \ at 90 km/h wasn't dangerous at all. He crashed us from behind leading us to huge\
  \ bang into the wall that divided the highway.\nAfter all the chaos of the accident\
  \ we were taken to the hospital and even though all went good, my aunt broke one\
  \ of her lumbar vertebrae and she was told to lie down for 20 days. No flying back\
  \ to Spain unless it was lying on a flat position. 20 days.\n\nImagine us trying\
  \ to speak English in a country where this is a thing. Imagine myself explaining\
  \ them with my Italian learnt in Duolingo all the info needed to get us back home.\
  \ Imagine how desperate we were.\n\nIt may sound like a cliche, but sometimes heroes\
  \ aren\u2019t dressed as such. We had the luck to meet Gabriele Magni, a tall and\
  \ funny Italian police officer that works in the hospital handling all the incidents\
  \ related to car accidents. At the beginning, I thought he was just doing his job\
  \ and trying to get us out of Italy asap (this was me being untrusting). But soon\
  \ I realized that he wasn't just doing his job. He did care about us. All of them\
  \ did.\n\nIn a world full of terrible news about people getting killed because of\
  \ religion, orientation and race it\u2019s not easy to find decent human beings\
  \ that help even if they don't know you at all. Help, support and love, expecting\
  \ nothing in return. No pay raise, no bonus. A brutal lesson to learn from.\n\n\
  After all, we managed to find a solution and the three of us we flew back to Spain.\
  \ I must admit that the very first thought that came to my mind after the crash\
  \ was that Italians shouldn't be allowed to get close to any moving mechanism. Coming\
  \ from a 27 yo man full of prejudices, it makes sense that I was full of anger towards\
  \ the whole nation. All I needed was time to back off and understand that the single\
  \ action of a man doesn\u2019t represent an entire country.\n\nAnd for the record,\
  \ this just-a-police-officer happens to be an Olympics medalist in Fencing in Sydney\
  \ 2000. He never showed any bit of arrogance. Not a tiny ounce of power abuse.\n\
  \nPure kindness. Pure modesty."
