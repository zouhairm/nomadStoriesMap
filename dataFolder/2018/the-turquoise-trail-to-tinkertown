Text: "The winters in Seattle are dreary: the days themselves are surpassingly short\
  \ and spots of sunlight among the nigh-constant cloud cover are fleeting at best.\
  \ From the moment the holiday lights snap off in January, I feel dragged down emotionally\
  \ and physically. Light therapy doesn\u2019t help, exercise doesn\u2019t help, a\
  \ healthy diet doesn\u2019t help, a junk food diet doesn\u2019t help. I needed to\
  \ get out of town for a while, feel the sun on my face, experience an emotion other\
  \ than anxiety and despair. The time was right to revisit New Mexico.\n\nHiding\
  \ in the hills outside Albuquerque lies Tinkertown, a museum collecting the life\u2019\
  s work of Ross Ward. Ward, an admirer of roadside attractions, set out to construct\
  \ his own: collecting, carving, and painting everything during the time, as he was\
  \ known to say, \u201Cwhile you were watching TV\u201D. \n\nFor a mere $3.75 per\
  \ person, you gain admission through the gates into the circuitous route of rooms\
  \ packed to the rafters with stuff, surrounded by walls made of over 50,000 glass\
  \ bottles. Throughout the exhibit are coin-activated dioramas: plunk in a coin or\
  \ two and they stutter to life. A grandmother bursts through a window to tell some\
  \ musicians to stop making such a racket. God and the Devil play tug of war over\
  \ a mortal soul, complete with flashes of lightning. A maquette equipped with a\
  \ cleaver chases a chicken around and around a wooden box. \n\nThe timing of my\
  \ visit was fortuitous, as local notable figure Anand Naren Oma and his tarot reading\
  \ goose, Princess Esmeralda, were on site plying their trade.  I needed no convincing:\
  \ if there\u2019s any creature on this earth who can know the future, it\u2019s\
  \ birds. How else can you explain how they know exactly when a shiny clean car will\
  \ pass directly underneath them to use as their personal toilet?\n\nI approached\
  \ the brightly-painted wooden booth, Oma resplendent in a caftan of crushed green\
  \ velvet and a matching headdress, bedecked with a smattering of bells, and inquired\
  \ about my future. The cards were shuffled, and I chose four. Upon flipping a card\
  \ over, Princess Esmeralda would chuckle and honk (and also bite at Oma, just because\
  \ she knows the future doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s not a goose) and Oma would translate\
  \ for her, telling me the meaning of the cards I chose. Abundance. Existence. Mind.\
  \ Healing. Exactly what I had come to New Mexico to find. I left Tinkertown feeling\
  \ truly lighthearted for the first time in months."
