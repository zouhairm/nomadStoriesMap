Text: "No sand swept wind greeted me as I stepped off the airplane and through the\
  \ white tunnel connector into my terminal in Cairo. Instead, I saw an old backlit\
  \ sign with an image of a man on a camel that read Egypt in Arabic and English.\
  \ I entered the passport line and handed my documents to a fair-skinned man with\
  \ a calm face. He flipped open my passport and smiled. \u201CJamaica! I love Jamaica!\u201D\
  \ he exclaimed. He turned away from me and shouted \u2018JAMAICA!\u2019 in the direction\
  \ of a nearby office with \u201CIMMIGRATION ID\u201D printed in gothic letters above\
  \ the door. With a chuckle, he turned back to me and smiled. \u201CI have a friend,\
  \ his name is Jamaica!\u201D In the midst of this exchange, a man with thick hair\
  \ and a generous moustache approached me. \u201CBaggage ticket,\u201D he said flatly.\
  \ The man took my ticket, muttered something about money, and walked away with my\
  \ suitcase. I opened my mouth in slight protest when I heard, \u201CJamaica! Come\
  \ here!\u201D It was the border officer, standing some distance away, much taller\
  \ than he seemed when sitting down. \u201CThis is Jamaica, \u201Dhe said, pointing\
  \ at a man beside him; short and bald with an athlete\u2019s build. The man asked\
  \ me if I was from Jamaica.\n \u201CYes,\u201D I replied.\nHe cackled with laughter\
  \ and gave me a monstrous handshake, not before punching me gleefully in the chest\
  \ the way old friends do.\n\u201CMy name is Jamaica because I love Jamaica!\u201D\
  \ he said.\n This did nothing to comfort me, especially the rapid appearance of\
  \ an additional five guards who, chuckling and laughing, ushered me into the small\
  \ immigration office. The now seven men were all intensely scrutinizing my passport.\
  \ I attempted to keep calm by observing a lady in the corner, wrapped from head\
  \ to toe in black silk typing nonchalantly on an ancient computer. \u2018Jamaica\u2019\
  \ flipped through my passport casually and turned to me. \u201CYour passport is\
  \ bad, but we will fix it,\u201D he said to me. The guards, now dead serious and\
  \ quiet ushered me to a bench outside where I sat for the next forty-five minutes,\
  \ wondering if I made a huge mistake when researching visa free entry to Egypt for\
  \ Jamaicans. Time passed, until I was completely alone in the terminal. Eventually,\
  \ a stout man in a gray suit appeared and gestured to a window I had not seen upon\
  \ entering the terminal. \u201CGo there and get your entry visa,\u201D the man said.\
  \ I bought the visa, got it stamped, quickly took my bag from the man with the moustache\
  \ and stepped outside, breathing a sigh of relief. I could feel the sand swept wind\
  \ on my face."
