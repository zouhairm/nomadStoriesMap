Text: "Do you know how to get acquainted with a new city? How to see his face, to\
  \ know his soul, to hear his voice? Keep your mind wide open! Try to walk alone\
  \ without discussing the news of politics or someone\xB4s life, do not get the camera\
  \ as soon as you see a beautiful picture before your eyes - lodge in memory, catch\
  \ the moment! That's how I tried to get to know the city that won my heart forever-\
  \ Valencia. A city where the past and the future are united in harmony, where the\
  \ population actively uses modern technologies, but preserves and respects traditions,\
  \ a city where you will never feel lonely even if you came alone.  \nWaking up early\
  \ in the morning (this is the best time to look at the sights while the tourists\
  \ are sleeping), I walked through the historic center of the city, having examined\
  \ the greatness of architecture. Each ancient building seemed to want to tell me\
  \ some stories that could happen 200-300 years before I came here and maybe they\
  \ will be able to tell my great-grandchildren about what this city sees nowadays.\
  \ \"Here, nearby Las Torres de Serrano, people might have been hiding during the\
  \ Civil War, or here at North Station, Carmen had to say goodbye to Jorge, her young,\
  \ dark-skinned, handsome Spanish sweetheart.\"- I imagined. Going down to the magnificent\
  \ City of Arts and Sciences, my breath was taking away. \"I wonder what will happen\
  \ next?\", -  thinking out loud one Spanish se\xF1ora. \"I wish I could know that,\"\
  \ I answered. So early in the morning I met se\xF1ora Matilda in the city of the\
  \ future, a huge impressive complex of art and science. The cinema and planetarium\
  \ The Hemesferic looks like a flying saucer, an opera house El Palau de les Arts\
  \ Reina Sofia, El Museu de les Ci\xE8ncies Pr\xEDncipe Felipe give the impression\
  \ that you are on another planet. \nFantasizing how our world will look in 100-200\
  \ years, there is still something that I would like to carry through the time -\
  \ Spanish hospitality. Without making plans for the day, I turned out to get master\
  \ class cooking real Valencian paella in one Spanish family. Traditions... Getting\
  \ to know the Spanish family will teach you how in the era of technology and haste,\
  \ you can appreciate the traditions and give time to what really matters and to\
  \ those who really love you. What would you bring to the future?"
