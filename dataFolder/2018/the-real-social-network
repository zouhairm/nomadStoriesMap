Text: "My mother was waiting online to chat, to hear everything about my 13-hour flight\
  \ to Havana. Getting online, however, proved to be a daunting task in Cuba. My Airbnb\
  \ host sold me a Wi-Fi card, took me to the balcony of her colonial home and pointed\
  \ into the darkness as to where I could find an open Wi-Fi hotspot to connect. It\
  \ was here, in a public park, while trying to connect to India, that I made my first\
  \ local connection. \nThe park was full of people typing, fighting and having phone\
  \ sex. I found a quiet bench, scratched the card for password and saw the timer\
  \ tick away even before a webpage loaded. I paid 2 CUC (2 US Dollars) for an hour\
  \ of slow Wi-Fi, that\u2019s 10% of a monthly average salary in Cuba. I barely logged\
  \ in, when a 20-something sat down, pointed to an open refrigerator on his phone\
  \ and started talking. I understood Amigo and Miami. Internet is a truly social\
  \ phenomenon in Cuba. People dress up to go to public spaces for access and end\
  \ up making real connections and so, I formally introduced myself to Jose Alejandro,\
  \ an aspiring film-maker, still giggling like a child about a milk carton in Miami.\n\
  He spoke a little English and offered to show me around Havana in the morning. I\
  \ paid him 5 CUC to keep emotional complications at bay. We first visited his friend\u2019\
  s art studio. It looked like a hoarder\u2019s dream come true \u2013 rusty spanners,\
  \ a single shoe! I met the artist, Humberto Moya, who explained how creativity was\
  \ an inherent Cuban trait: \u201CWe\u2019ve limited access to replacement parts\
  \ so we hoard, even broken things, because parts can be used to fix something else.\
  \ When we buy something for the house we also acquire the technical know-how to\
  \ fix it.\u201D\nCubans I figured are like surgeons, desensitized to wounds, always\
  \ opening something up, a result of the shutting out by their powerful neighbour\
  \ in the North. \nHumberto\u2019s son was wearing a hand-painted t-shirt of an airborne,\
  \ moustachioed \u2013superhero. Who is that? I asked. \u201CIf something goes missing\
  \ in Cuba we say it flew away like Matias P\xE9rez - a character inspired by a hot-air\
  \ balloonist who disappeared without a trace 1856,\u201D Humberto\u2019s girlfriend,\
  \ Yirina Luis, responded.\nVery few Cuban children have access to toys and make\
  \ do with what the world calls Upscale Recycle. The people I met on day one in Cuba\
  \ helped me realise that it is a land of ingenuity and redeemed aesthetics. A place\
  \ that elevates the heart, how can it not? When an old man tinkers away at soda\
  \ can to make a car for his grandson."
