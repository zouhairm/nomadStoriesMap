Text: "Better to see something once than hear about it a thousand times\u201D\nI learned\
  \ it the hard way.\n\nI shouldn't have come here. These thoughts came across my\
  \ mind. When I was looking at the chaotic situation outside.\nFriday, Nov. 13, 2015\
  \ was a strangely balmy night in Paris, the kind that makes visitors fall in love\
  \ with the city. People spilled out of the caf\xE9s, winding down the workweek over\
  \ glasses of wine, their chatter and laughter creating a soft hubbub on the streets,\
  \ as pedestrians sidestepped the crowds.\nAnd then, in a few ghastly moments, everything\
  \ changed.\nIn just two hours, in France\u2019s worst terror attack in history,\
  \ 129 people lay dead.\_\n\n\nThe past couple of days have been really great. I\
  \ was having a great time visiting instantly recognisable architectural icons, along\
  \ with exquisite cuisine, and priceless artistic treasures of the city. I knew Paris\
  \ was really a good idea.\n\nBut now I was seeing a different side of it. It no\
  \ longer seemed as La Ville Lumi\xE8re(City of lights) , it was surrounded by the\
  \ darkness of terror. I remember seeing something unusual, the death and the terror,\
  \ injured people running, even without exactly knowing what\u2019s going on,\_I\
  \ felt what terrorism looks like with chaos, scream and fear.\n\nSomehow that apocalyptic\
  \ night ended when police & task forces took everything in control.Next day was\
  \ totally different than i expected.\nPeople were paying tribute to the victims.I\
  \ added myself into as well.As we swarmed into the Place de la R\xE9publique for\
  \ huge vigils, the relatives of the dead, and the victims themselves seemed thrilled.\
  \ I saw their tearful eyes , but the tears were of strength. A banner in the square\
  \ under the Marianne statue, above the melted candles and withered bouquets, reads\
  \ \u201Cm\xEAme pas peur\u201D\u2014roughly translated as \u201Cwe are not afraid\u201D\
  \u2014a slogan that is surely as fitting for the brave citizens.\n\nEven though\
  \ I was just a visitor.I was feeling hurt , my eyes were filled with tears.It seemed\
  \ that I lost something that mattered , something precious.Now I got to see my new\
  \ side. A face that was never revealed to me.I was a changed man now.I felt more\
  \ humane , I have made a local connection with Paris.\n\nIt's true that now there\
  \ is 'before' and 'after' the 13th\_of November.\n\nIt was an intense environment.The\
  \ terrorist attack might have harnessed peace & harmony but it allowed me to discover\
  \ a special artifact - a more humane connection."
