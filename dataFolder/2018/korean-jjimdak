Text: "We had spent the day roasting under the South Korean sun, listening to the\
  \ cicadas and using paper mache fans to fake a breeze. It was our last day in Korea,\
  \ and we were adamant about getting a little more history before we headed back\
  \ to the U.S. The sun in the Hahoe Folk Village was brutal, however, despite the\
  \ sweat running down my back in lazy lines, I was enjoying myself. WooJae, our guide\
  \ who at one point in our month long trip turned into good friend suggested we get\
  \ dinner. \n\n\"We are going to have food made famous in Andong. It was created\
  \ here, and I'm going to take you to the best restaurant to have it!\" WooJae talked\
  \ excitedly about the food as we drove to the restaurant. \n\nWe arrived at Andon\
  \ Gu Market, a glass-covered alley where restaurants, shops, and food sellers join\
  \ together to create an almost overwhelming experience. The market was busy, people\
  \ pushed past our little group of Americans as we shuffled our feet and tried to\
  \ take in all the sights and sounds.  The entrance to the restaurant was through\
  \ the kitchen, on the makeshift patio of the restaurant, where a man was vigorously\
  \ stirring a pan of vegetables cloaked in steam. WooJae argued with the shop owner\
  \ for a moment before waving us inside past the hot stove and meat refrigerators.\
  \ We had to stop at the door to pull our shoes off and leave them in emptied plastic\
  \ fruit crates before we could enter the dining room. The tables were traditional\
  \ low tables with little cushions on the floor we squeezed around two tables. If\
  \ I stood in the middle of the room and stretched my arms out I could touch two\
  \ of the walls.\n\nI wasn't sure what was what going to come of this dinner. All\
  \ I knew was that I was hungry and WooJae promised utter and pure delight. After\
  \ about 15 minutes our food arrived, a massive steaming bowl of jjimdak. The bowl\
  \ nearly spilled onto the table and was full of cellophane noodles, vegetables,\
  \  chicken and a delicious brown marinade. WooJae raised his silver water cup, slick\
  \ with condensation, up to us. \"Geonbae.\" He said, toasting to one of our last\
  \ meals in Korea. \n\nI picked up my chopsticks and dug into the Jjimdak, and in\
  \ an instant, I knew the dish. The thick spicy sauce was easy to remember. The first\
  \ time I toured Korea my homestay had made it for dinner. It was one of my most\
  \ cherished moments and one of my first impressions of Korea. The two times I had\
  \ the dish I was sat on the floor surrounded by good friends, hot air, and laughter\
  \ and the love for a country."
