Text: "\u201CDon\u2019t look down\u201D, I walk rather try balancing on the square\
  \ boundary wall of \u2018Kali da Tibba\u2019, a fortress styled temple built on\
  \ the highest peak in Chail. There\u2019s just one voice this morning, that of my\
  \ old friend vertigo.\n\n\u201CIt\u2019s dangerous to drive up to the mountain top\
  \ in the dark\u201D, Sandeep, our driver too thought it was a joke last night when\
  \ asked to pick us at 4 to catch the 5 am sunrise.\u201CNobody goes there\u201D\
  \ he had added. \n\nThe west is in denial that a new day is beginning. Even the\
  \ pines look fast asleep. I look closer far into the distance, the chimneys have\
  \ started smoking and the little hamlet is dotted with blotches of orange yellow\
  \ lights. My ordeal too has just begun; I rush to the next side.\n\nSame colours,\
  \ same blotches but this time in the sky. I blink furiously and smell deeply, as\
  \ the foggy chills get slowly replaced by an increasingly warmer breeze. The sun\
  \ must be coming up, but it\u2019s a long way to reach its side.\u201CYou can always\
  \ jump off to the safe grounds and run to click it\u201D. Instead I stop to watch\
  \ its reflection play on the untouched part of the valley and hear the birds greet\
  \ the lone milkman speeding downhill on his bicycle.\nMore than half way, on to\
  \ the third side, I finally meet the sunrise.\u201CHaven\u2019t you seen a one before?!\
  \ Why the drama today?\u201D I feel too small, against the magnanimous contradiction\
  \ of silence and chaos this morning is transforming into, to continue with my arrogant\
  \ mental chatter. I now take quiet measured steps following the rhythm set by the\
  \ layered illumination of the blue grey mountains turning into golden green ranges.\
  \ I am not breathing alone.  \n\n\u201CNo more valleys to face!\u201D, I rejoice\
  \ as the final side runs parallel to the priests\u2019 housing. Except that it\u2019\
  s sliding roof seems to be a favourite amongst the local langoors. \u201CWhy did\
  \ this one have to be an early riser? And why is he following me, not like I would\
  \ jump on the roof and threaten his territory?\u201D \nTrembling I take that last\
  \ step, then turn to face him and he finally poses in an attacking stance. I freeze,\
  \ he flips around and runs away to what I just noticed, is his tiny baby now at\
  \ a safe distance from me. \n\nA Pradakshina or circumambulation of a deity is a\
  \ spiritual concept in eastern religions representing transitions through stages\
  \ in life. I don\u2019t step inside the temple. \n\nSandeep chuckles, \u201CDidi,\
  \ the priest came running out of the temple, assuming you were here at this hour\
  \ to pray!\u201D \n\n\u201CBut I did\u201D, I reply honestly. I completed the Pradakshina."
