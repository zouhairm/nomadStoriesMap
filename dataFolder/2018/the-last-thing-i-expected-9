Text: "I\u2019m standing on the edge of a cliff face, 16 metres above the ocean, watching\
  \ as ominous clouds fill the darkening skies \u201Cquickly\u201D I say. Lightning\
  \ flashing off in the distance. \u201CWe need to head back to the island NOW!\u201D\
  \ Deafening thunder shakes the night sky and rain starts pelting down, in big fat,\
  \ tropical drops. \u201CIs there another way down?\u201D the girl asks \u201CI\u2019\
  m not sure if I can do this\u201D. She\u2019s leaning back against a rock ledge\
  \ nervously, \u201Cyou\u2019ll be fine\u201D I reassure her, starting to feel a\
  \ little nervous myself \u201Ctake my hand and step out to the edge\u201D I say,\
  \ she edges nervously out to the empty ledge. \u201CReady?\u201D I yell. \u201C\
  One. Two. Three\u201D the group chants in unison. The girl launches herself out\
  \ into the open air and free-falls the 15 metres into the deep, dark ocean below.\n\
  \nIf you\u2019d told me three months earlier, I\u2019d be working as a tour guide,\
  \ on the idyllic island Koh Phi Phi. Helping to shuffle hundreds of tourists a week\
  \ between the crystal clear waters of Maya Bay (made famous by Leonardo Di Caprio\
  \ in \u2018The Beach\u2019) attractions the island offered, I would\u2019ve said\
  \ you were crazy. Then I\u2019d met Tom, a happy go lucky Dutch backpacker from\
  \ Amsterdam \u201CWe\u2019re looking for tour guides\u201D he said smiling \u201C\
  the money covers your food and accommodation, plus a few extras\u201D he added.\
  \ We\u2019re sitting at a beach bar staring out across a beautiful blue ocean, underneath\
  \ a cloudless sky \u201CWhat\u2019s the worst that could happen?\u201D, \u201CYou\
  \ get a few free tours of the island\u201D. The next day I tagged along. Spending\
  \ the day snorkelling among the colourful fish and docile reef sharks. Watching\
  \ as boat loads of tourists navigated the throngs of people in an effort to get\
  \ that perfect Maya bay photo, jumping off of cliffs and, as the sun went down swimming\
  \ in the ocean, magical plankton glowing all around us.\n\n \u201CWow, I started\
  \ getting worried there for a moment\u201D I tell the crowd of backpackers. Soaked\
  \ head to toe from a late summer storm. It\u2019s a balmy night, hot and humid despite\
  \ the rain. \u201CWhen that lightning started I thought we might have a real problem\u201D\
  . \u201CYou told me we\u2019d be fine!\u201D the girl says with a playful slap.\
  \ It\u2019s the same girl I\u2019d helped to the edge of the cliff earlier. \u201C\
  Well, you did really well, you barely hesitated once you got to the edge of the\
  \ cliff\u201D she laughs. \u201CJumping was the easy part\u201D she remarks \u201C\
  getting to the edge was the real hard part\u201D. I lean back and take a sip of\
  \ my beer. \u201CThis is the last thing I expected to be doing\u201D I think to\
  \ myself with a satisfied smile."
