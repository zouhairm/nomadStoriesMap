Text: "The ego kills. Many people don't believe this, but it is certainly true.\n\
  Darkness had crept back into the shadow of the world, and prayer flags were gently\
  \ clapping in the wind. Tired, hungry and oxygen-starved, I slung the pack over\
  \ my shoulder and proceeded back onto the withered path.\n\nThis had been the godforsaken\
  \ route many sherpas had warned of, and there was a melancholic atmosphere among\
  \ the climbers. It had been 15 days since the climbers had been around any civilized\
  \ settlement, and it had begun to grind. Air had become problematic too, and hacking\
  \ coughs could be heard up and down the line of hopeful summit bidders.\n\n\"Mr.\
  \ Alex!, please go carefully with your step, you don't want to take the grand tour\
  \ down the mountainside!\" shouted Pol Han, one of the more experienced mountain\
  \ guides on the trip.\nI did not respond. I was too exhausted. Everybody was.\n\
  There was an unspoken agreement of silence among the team.\n\nUp here on the roof\
  \ of the world, nothing mattered. Just one leaden foot in front of the other. There\
  \ was a beautiful sickle moon in the dark blue sky. Mountain peaks pierced the blanket\
  \ of cloud far below like fairy lights casting shadows with mystical dimensions.\n\
  The past no longer haunted, and although struggling, I felt a sense of liberation\
  \ for the first time. A gentle peace had imbibed the lucid air.\n\nSuddenly, the\
  \ peace was shattered as panicked voices echoed in the line behind me. I turned\
  \ to see. One by one, the team fell, each one pulling the next one off, rope by\
  \ rope. My cam snagged. The line of helpless bodies flung off the mountainside,\
  \ leaving me helplessly hanging off the precipice.\nMy ice axe was the only thing\
  \ holding the team from falling. It was futile. All efforts to pull the team up\
  \ were in vain. My arms bore no strength. The men were panicked, pulling and thrashing\
  \ on the precarious rope. There was only one option. I had to cut them off to save\
  \ myself. With tears welling in my eyes, I cut the poor souls off into oblivion.\
  \ And hauled my body back to safety. \n\nSlinging my pack back on. Tired, hungry\
  \ and oxygen-starved, I climbed on.\nI had craved for a lifetime to see the summit,\
  \ the top of the world. It wasn't far off now. The faces of those helpless teammates\
  \ turned over in my mind, like hungry ghosts. It was as if they were reminding me\
  \ of the inevitable.\nThere was no way back without anybody to belay me. Clinging\
  \ to my ego. A dream come true.\nAt the lonely cost of a one-way ascent toward heaven.\n\
  Never to return."
