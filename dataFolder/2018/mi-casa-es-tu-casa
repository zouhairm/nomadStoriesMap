Text: "When I met Gily and Carlos from Mexico at a bus station in Venice I would have\
  \ never thought that I would end up visiting them for New Year\u2019s Eve at their\
  \ hometown Toluca in Mexico. After a lovely two hour chat about travelling, I got\
  \ invited to visit them and I couldn\u2019t let that chance pass by. Two months\
  \ later I boarded a flight to Mexico City and I was astonished by the warm welcome\
  \ of my new friends Gily and Carlos. Not only did I meet their parents but as well\
  \ all uncles and aunties and cousins and their children. I never felt so much love\
  \ coming from people I've just met. The day before I had to say Good Bye and to\
  \ continuing my travel to other parts of Mexico we decided to visit a lake. As it\
  \ was still vacation time all the family came along. We were a group of 15 people,\
  \ 14 Mexicans and one Italian - me. The drive to the lake was the funniest ever\
  \ because we stopped for several occasions: The first stop was for a late breakfast\
  \ at a very basic open restaurant where everyone ate tacos, in all different flavours.\
  \ As a vegetarian I l got lucky because I could ask for vegetarian options: I got\
  \ to eat tacos con hongos huitlacoche y tacos con flor de calabaza. Everyone ordered\
  \ coffee as well, but not an americano - instead, we slurped the sweet cafe de olla\
  \ which is a traditional Mexican coffee. At the next stop, some of Gily and Carlos\u2019\
  s family member wanted to change cars. I was in the game and shortly after I sat\
  \ in a different car as well. The third stop was for drinks: Carlos had well considered\
  \ stowed drinks in a cool box along with some ice. Tequila with Coke got served.\
  \ When we finally arrived at the lake, we walked to the shore and some of the men\
  \ carried the heavy and well stuffed cool box. For other people we must have been\
  \ a funny picture, or at least in my hometown we would have been: A big family,\
  \ grandma and granddad, their children and grandchildren and a big cool box, boarding\
  \ altogether a public boat. The boat ride turned into a family party: everyone was\
  \ chatting and at some point everyone got to shake their dancing legs, even the\
  \ over 70-years old. Snacks were being passed and music was being played on the\
  \ boat. Who would have guessed that I would be celebrating the new year 2018 with\
  \ a Mexican family, feeling like one of them, enjoying the sun, the breeze and the\
  \ view on a boat on Lake Valle de Bravo? The love that keeps the family together\
  \ swept over to my heart and soul and left some tears in my eyes. I knew I have\
  \ found my second family!"
