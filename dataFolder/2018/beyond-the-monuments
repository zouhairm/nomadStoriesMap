Text: "A guest house staff looked at me with a raised eyebrow and a frivolous smirk.\
  \ He then playfully ran a quick gaze from top to bottom and rhetorically asked \u201C\
  You?\u201D this was when he found out I planned to go rock climbing later that day.\
  \ We laughed over his judgment of my capabilities and Oh! How right was he!\n\n\
  \ My friend and I made way to the rock climbing shop called \u201CTom and Jerry\u201D\
  . The shop was on the side of Tungabhadra River which is famously known as the Hippie\
  \ Island. It is here where I felt like a foreigner in my own country, few Indians\
  \ were seen. We walked over the shady mucky roads crossing foreigners on two-wheelers,\
  \ bountiful fields which came to life with the mild breeze and plenty makeshift\
  \ stores. At one such temporary shop, sat a young man probably in his early twenties,\
  \ a local who spoke English with an accent that made mine feel inferior.\n\nThis\
  \ was Sunny, our rock climbing instructor for the day. He learned his trade from\
  \ the outsiders who graced his land from his childhood; this explains his unique\
  \ accent and ability to converse in several languages.  With him we made way to\
  \ the top of a rocky hill which carried several boulders, the smell of an illegal\
  \ herb lingered in the air probably a strain from Mysore. As we prepared for our\
  \ climb, Sunny showed at a distance, an incongruous white wall which had a spray\
  \ painting of a climber. This was where his old office stood; the land was seized\
  \ and the building bulldozed by the government in the name of protecting the old\
  \ heritage monuments within the expanse. This was the norm and plenty were the woes\
  \ of the people who lost their livelihoods and were forcefully displaced from homes.\
  \ One cannot envisage the burden a World Heritage title bestows upon the people\
  \ of such serene land.\n\nAfter the grueling climb, we sat on an enormous boulder\
  \ along with several other locals and foreigners who were crafting music with locally\
  \ made djembes and ukuleles. Next to me sat a little monkey, who chewed on my jacket\
  \ aglet while we waited for the sun to sleep. As the sun sunk slowly, I could see\
  \ the greatness of the land I was in, Hampi.  \n\nThe remnants of the Tom and Jerry\
  \ shop stood tall among the fields with its art gleaming proudly. This wall to me\
  \ was Sunny\u2019s heritage, for who are we to put boundaries on what needs to be\
  \ protected and what is Heritage."
