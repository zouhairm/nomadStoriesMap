Text: "The tourist trains clogging up the Everest Base Camp trek in Nepal are telling\
  \ of just how many people desire the glory of being able to say they\u2019ve been\
  \ to Everest. Taking into account that we were planning our hike in the Everest\
  \ region in high tourist season, when the cool winter sky allows a brief window\
  \ to spot the half-Tibetan, half-Nepali giant, we chose a less-trodden path. Our\
  \ final summit would be to Gokyo Ri, a two-hour 500-vertical-metre climb from the\
  \ lake at Gokyo.\n\nOn summit day, we lay huddled in our nylon cocoons, waiting\
  \ for my cellphone to go off, both of us anxious that the battery had died during\
  \ the night. Two weeks on the trail had numbed our shoulders and beaten our knees,\
  \ but we\u2019d pushed through with anti-inflammatory cream and Snickers bars. \"\
  Morning\", I mumbled.\n\nOutside, the dark peaks formed an arena around the silent\
  \ cluster of teahouses. The milky blue water of the Gokyo Lake had turned black\
  \ and its smaller streams had turned hard.\n\nNadia, being a mountain goat, powered\
  \ ahead of me, leaving me alone with my growing despair. My chest burned with each\
  \ icy inhale and my calves were beginning to cramp. Having to take breaks so frequently\
  \ only intensified my frustration. For the first time in the trek and maybe the\
  \ fourth time in my life, I was overwhelmed with the feeling that I\u2019d reached\
  \ my limit\u2026\n\nI was so focused on my feet that I didn\u2019t notice him coming\
  \ towards me. I knew he was on the trail but for whatever reason, I\u2019d assumed\
  \ I\u2019d never see him again. \u201CYou\u2019ve summited already!\u201D\n\n\u201C\
  Yeah, I wanted to watch the sunrise\u201D, he replied in his soft Melbourne accent,\
  \ his face glowing with sweat and energy.\n\nWe had met him about a week before.\
  \ We reckoned he was a bloody miracle because he\u2019d climbed a 6500m peak in\
  \ -30 degree wind chill despite being built like a twig.\n\nHe smiled sympathetically\
  \ at my weary expression and pointed up at the summit. \u201CYou see that white\
  \ flag? That\u2019s the goal. You\u2019re only about half an hour off. The worst\
  \ is over.\u201D He looked at me kindly and squeezed my shoulder.\n\nI nodded, looked\
  \ up at the white flag once more and took a step forward.\n\nTwenty minutes later,\
  \ I stood on a rock above the array of Buddhist prayer flags, my hands on my hips\
  \ and my jacket around my waist. Cool droplets of sweat trickled down my lower back.\
  \ My feet were tender in my boots. My cheeks were warm from the sun. I felt tall.\
  \ And there was a mountain to my left, bigger and mightier than all others.\n\n\
  I smiled, grateful for all of it."
