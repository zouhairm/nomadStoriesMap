Text: "My Iceland trip had been spectacular so far, but I knew I\u2019d love the Westfjords\
  \ best. I planned to hike and, with luck, encounter an arctic fox in Hornstrandir,\
  \ so I was in search of the ferry schedule. I stopped for coffee and WiFi at the\
  \ information center in H\xF3lmav\xEDk and learned the ferry goes only once a day.\
  \ Two days in Hornstrandir meant less time for exploring the rest of the Westfjords!\n\
  \nAs I studied my map, wondering if I could kayak from Nor\xF0urfj\xF6r\xF0ur to\
  \ Hornstrandir and back in a day, a man approached me, smiling. His shirt had an\
  \ ancient symbol identical to the one on the apron of the girl running the caf\xE9\
  . With weathered skin and dark, wiry hair sticking out beneath his hat, he looked\
  \ like a 17th-century wizard. He laughed at my idea of kayaking to Hornstrandir,\
  \ but when he offered his kayak to use in the nearby fjord, whales and seals drove\
  \ foxes from my mind. He was delighted by my excitement and refused to accept money.\n\
  \nHe left to get the gear. I flipped through a display book at the caf\xE9 and froze\
  \ when I recognized a photo I\u2019d seen years ago in a guidebook. The necropants!\
  \ I laughed when I realized this information center was also the Museum of Icelandic\
  \ Sorcery and Witchcraft, and my new friend was Sigur\xF0ur Atlason, the manager\
  \ and curator of this museum and the Sorcerer\u2019s Cottage 27 km northeast.\n\n\
  Into my drybag went water, snacks, sunblock, toilet paper, phone, and keys. I donned\
  \ the drysuit and situated myself in the cockpit while Sigur\xF0ur laughed at my\
  \ clumsiness and shouted cheerfully from the shore, \u201Cif you roll, you will\
  \ die from hypothermia!\u201D I paddled out into Steingr\xEDmsfj\xF6r\xF0. Gulls\
  \ harassed me near the shore. Farther out, a curious seal kept me company. Puffins\
  \ dived across the water. At the tip of the peninsula across from Grimsey Island,\
  \ I ate my peanuts and raisins. A whale spouted far in the distance. Satisfied,\
  \ I paddled back across the fjord. My shoulders ached, and I had a sunburn despite\
  \ reapplying sunblock at my lunch stop. Sigur\xF0ur was eager to hear about my trip,\
  \ and he didn\u2019t believe how far I had gone until I showed him the pin I had\
  \ dropped on the map.\n\nThe museum was fascinating. I learned the symbol was thought\
  \ to offer protection from abuse of power. I admired the necropants. I bought shirts\
  \ for me and my daughter, hugged Sigur\xF0ur, and drove up the coast to pitch my\
  \ tent in Nor\xF0urfj\xF6r\xF0ur.\n\nAnd that\u2019s where I saw my arctic fox,\
  \ when she darted through my headlights, zigzagged up the mountainside, and vanished."
