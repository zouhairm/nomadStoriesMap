Text: "The hot humid wind swings the thermal white bag. Back and forth, back and forth,\
  \ back and forth, it goes, hanged on a tree branch, almost touching the dark water.\
  \ The plastic reflects the last rays of Sun. Pink and yellow. It\u2019s June, end\
  \ of the rainy season in the Amazon forest and for the previous months Negro River\
  \ advanced smoothly, swallowing meters of land. Now treetops grow from the river.\
  \ A submerse world I can feel with my feet. \n\nDona S\xF4nia is beside me, her\
  \ black hair up, her brown skin disappearing into the water. She slides her arms\
  \ on Negro\u2019s surface, forming tiny waves, and smiles. She grabs a beer can\
  \ from the bag, opens it carefully, and stares at me with fire eyes. \u201CHave\
  \ you ever listened the story about the giant snake that lives in Negro?\u201D\n\
  \nI shake my head, looking at the immense liquid darkness ahead of us. Bird songs\
  \ fill the silence. On the other side, ten meters away, there is the narrow strip\
  \ of sand. I try to stand but hit a trunk. I feel my toe bleeding. We flap our legs\
  \ to remain above the ground.\n\n\u201CPeople say is just a legend, but I believe\
  \ in it. You know, Amaz\xF4nia is an entity. There are things we can\u2019t understand\u201D\
  , she says calmly, watching the sky change colors. The forest is around us, the\
  \ trees bordering the water as long as we can see. \u201CYes...but do you really\
  \ think it\u2019s real?\u201D I ask. \u201CUhm\u201D, she nods, in a perky smile.\
  \ \n\nGranddaughter of indigenous women who married white men, Sonia knows her forest.\
  \ She had lived there all her life, beside the river, watching its fantastic creatures\
  \ move during the night. She talks about the Amazonian legends with vehemence and\
  \ her voice, half solemn half playful, makes you trust there is an entire universe\
  \ underwater. \n\nI had met Sonia two days before and she had grown both familiar\
  \ and mysterious to me. I was staying at her house during my trip to the Brazilian\
  \ Amazon. She lived with her husband, a retired naval officer, at S\xE3o Jo\xE3\
  o do Tup\xE9, a small community an hour from Manaus, and rented a room for tourists.\
  \ There weren\u2019t that many visitors. S\xE3o Jo\xE3o had sixty residents, a church\
  \ and a school. There was no electricity after 7 pm, since the school\u2019s generator\
  \ couldn\u2019t work for many hours in a row. Everything would go dark after the\
  \ sunset. Only the moon would illuminate the dirt roads as Dona S\xF4nia opened\
  \ her bedroom window. Every night I would imagine her observing the water, perhaps\
  \ in search of her magical beings. I wondered if she herself might be one."
