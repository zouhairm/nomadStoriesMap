Text: "I stepped out of my Volkswagen Jetta packed with 25 years of my life and inhaled\
  \ a whiff of manure, alpaca spit and rotting plant residue. After 5 days of trekking\
  \ through barren desert, catching tumbleweeds in my tires, getting altitude sickness,\
  \ and eating grits, I finally checked out of hotel California. \n\nDay 1 in Mechanicsburg,\
  \ Pennsylvania and my mom is ecstatic that her quarter-life crisis suffering daughter\
  \ chose to be in the same Podunk town as her parents. \n\n\u201CDo you want to feed\
  \ goats at the farm? Or should we go watch ponies do math?\u201D\n\u201CI don\u2019\
  t know mom, I\u2019m hungry\u201D\n\u201CLets go to Lancaster, remind me to get\
  \ Amish Peanut Butter!\u201D\n\nFor 8 years LA bribed me. You can be a beach bum\
  \ and a snow bunny in the same day all year round. The ability to travel 7,000 miles\
  \ in 20 minutes by enjoying a $15 Spa Day in Koreatown, Kabob in Persian Square,\
  \ or Halo Halo for dessert in Historic Filipino Town. My stomach was constantly\
  \ growling, but I had to stay styling. Character is measured using someone\u2019\
  s followers to following ratio. The daily commute of 3 hours on top of one parking\
  \ ticket a week. You become cynical and ride a slippery slope towards soullessness\
  \ because of the intentions of fellow Los Angelenos; all of the social climbers\
  \ and the soul-snatching industries. My bubble bursted and I left.\n\nAccustomed\
  \ to apartments stacked in the city life, I was astonished at the amount of land\
  \ around each home. Children on scooters shared the one lane streets. Not one brake\
  \ light on unless to stop for a horse and buggy to cross. Haystacks 20 feet tall\
  \ stretched for miles as well as tractors for sale. \n\n\u201CPLEASE DO NOT PHOTOGRAPH\
  \ THE AMISH FOLK\u201D the sign read as we walked into the store.\n\nUnlike celebrities\
  \ in Hollywood, the Amish are pros when it comes to dodging the paparazzi. Humility\
  \ is a highly cherished value and photos accentuate individuality and call attention\
  \ to one\u2019s self, this is a threat to community harmony. \n\nI had to acclimate.\
  \ There was only one geofilter within a 50-mile radius and no instagrammable or\
  \ pinteristy walls to pose in front of. \n\nI began to strive to have their willpower.\
  \ They are anxious to be uninfluenced by modern ways and want to be remembered by\
  \ the lives they live and the examples they set, not by physical appearance. I was\
  \ so used to the significance of aesthetics; the facades. \n\nFor me, this cross-country\
  \ move was my version of a \u201CRumspringa\u201D. I tested the waters of freedom\
  \ from my everyday chaos and began to live a simpler life."
