Text: "No sooner had my feet collided with the jagged land of Wollo, my nose breathed\
  \ in the rejuvenating fresh air of the country, and my eyes registered the small\
  \ sparsely populated town than I was suddenly engulfed in hugs and smothered with\
  \ kisses. I was astounded to say the least. Yes, I was aware that it's the custom\
  \ of Northern Ethiopians to greet one another in such an overly affectionate manner.\
  \ What I didn't know was that they would greet me-a complete stranger-as if I were\
  \ one of their own.\nWallowing in a mixed feeling of joy at being shown much love\
  \ and discomfort at being invaded my personal space, I was led to one of their humble\
  \ abodes.\nI was once again welcomed with open arms. The inhabitants of the house\
  \ competed with one another to make me feel at home. They unburdened my aching shoulder\
  \ from the weight of my loaded backpack. They served me \"injera-be-wet\"-the traditional\
  \ Ethiopian food-to calm my growling stomach. They even insisted on washing my throbbing\
  \ feet. This-I knew-was a sign of deep respect.\nLater that night, as we all sat\
  \ around a bonfire overlooking the horizon, I summoned up the courage to ask the\
  \ questions that were gnawing my brain all day. I asked them why they would let\
  \ someone like me-a stranger from another town-invade the privacy of their home.\
  \ I asked them why they would bother to welcome someone they had never met before\
  \ with so much care and respect. I asked them why they didn't hesitate one bit when\
  \ they ushered me into their open arms.\nThey answered my questions with one simple\
  \ phrase \"Bet-yeigziabher-new\". This translates into \"All houses belong to God\"\
  .\nAlthough I'm not in the least bit religious, the implied meaning was not lost\
  \ upon me. What they meant to say was that if God had provided them with food to\
  \ satisfy their hunger, cloth to cover their bare skin, and a house to sleep under,\
  \ who are they to refuse these same privileges to another. \nAs I sat there amidst\
  \ my fellow country men watching the fire insatiably devour the logs of wood, listening\
  \ to the cows low in the distance, I wondered if it was the hardship in urban life\
  \ that made us-city dwellers-so cold and suspicious.\nI immediately knew I was wrong.\
  \ Hardship is not struggling to pay the bills. Hardship is being unable to feed\
  \ your kids. Hardship is watching your loved ones starve to death. No one knows\
  \ this better than the people of Wollo. Yet, they continue to give all that they\
  \ have. They give their food, their drinks, and most importantly, their love."
