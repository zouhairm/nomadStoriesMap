Text: "I am in Sumatra, in the deep valley of Aceh. The guesthouse, on the edge of\
  \ the only concrete road that runs through the wilderness, overlooks a stretch of\
  \ banana trees that shelters it from the roar of the river. In my tiny room the\
  \ creaky old bed makes a plastic noise every time I turn; behind the little wooden\
  \ door there\u2019s an empty tiled room with a shabby toilet only. I have few hours\
  \ to sleep before my three days trip in the jungle. I close my eyes in the pale\
  \ blue walls, listening to the incessant sound of the crickets, trying to tame my\
  \ excitement. \n\nI am quickly ready in the morning, dressed like a pro, lightweight\
  \ backpack and anti-leeches socks. A short young guy, with a funny round face, bowl-like\
  \ black hair, comes toward me as soon as I step out of the door: \u201CHello! I\
  \ am Aciah, your guide. You ready?\u201D he says with a shrill voice. I wonder for\
  \ how long he has been waiting out of the door, to make such a successful entrance.\
  \ Brief introductions and we are on the move in the yellow morning mist. When we\
  \ reach what seem to be a break amid the trees, Aciah mechanically stops: \u201C\
  So, first thing, when you walk, you look down: because black snake. But also, you\
  \ look up: because green snake. Dangerous\u201D he says. \u2018That\u2019s very\
  \ reassuring\u2019 I thought. \n\nInside, the vision turns green; the thick foliage\
  \ barely allows to glimpse the sky; the plants grow free in the anarchy of the fertile\
  \ earth, and gnarled branches cross the air in search of light. A chorus of sounds:\
  \ crickets and birds, and the scream of faraway monkeys sometimes. \nAfter seven\
  \ hours of walking up and down, damp in sweat, we reach our shelter, a transparent\
  \ plastic tent few meters away from the river. The rain is pouring, ticking intensely\
  \ on the plastic ceiling. We light a small torch, which attracts a variety of unidentifiable\
  \ insects and huge ants, so we turn it off. \n\nWe sit there, Aciah and I, eating\
  \ spicy chicken rice and chatting in the dark. Across the streaks of the raindrops,\
  \ I see the pale light of the full moon illuminating the tops of the trees. Aciah\
  \ smokes his menthol cigarette, while he starts telling me about his life. The hours\
  \ pass, and we become friends: me, the blonde cosmopolitan girl that lives in the\
  \ capitalist world, and the little innocent guy of the jungle. Indonesia had donated\
  \ me unforgettable moments, but inside the tent that night, laying down in the cool\
  \ air with the roots under my back, silent tears of happiness streamed down my cheeks."
