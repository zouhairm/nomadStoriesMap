Text: "It was a curious thing; the way the light fell that day, gleamed on the dew-drenched\
  \ leaves outside\u2026but more so the nervous excitement rising up in me so plenteous\
  \ I could barely hold the steaming cup of coffee in my hand steady. I travelled\
  \ young in age, alone, in a foreign country. I knew not whom I could rely on. I\
  \ knew not what tomorrow would bring. I knew not where I would live or where I was\
  \ going tomorrow. I knew I would be studying what I loved. This was the epitome\
  \ of my chaotic silence. Those unknowns, that anxiousness rendered me adrift and\
  \ faith bound like a helpless child unaccustomed to change, too na\xEFve to handle\
  \ conflict ever present. Yet I remained eating appeltaart and sipping hot coffee.\
  \ The small European apartment of my distant relatives was cozy, gezellig as the\
  \ Dutch would say. I opened a book in hopes of eliminating my thoughts. As I scanned\
  \ the pages of the hardcover, nonfiction art book, I perceived it was all in Dutch.\
  \ Scanning further down the page I saw the words, \u201Chabent sua fata libelli.\u201D\
  \ The translation clearly underneath; According to the capabilities of the reader,\
  \ books have their destiny. When the rain slowed, I opened the door, the warm air\
  \ and earthly petrichor flooded into my lungs. The vibrant shades of green radiated\
  \ in the suns light; roots deep in the aged ground were once all seeds scattered,\
  \ carried, transplanted, transformed. These mighty, enveloped, disclosed, unfolded\
  \ the road advancing like the thoughts in my head and the path I trekked on. It\
  \ reduced into a town square. The bench I sat on was perfect for watching the ebb\
  \ and flow of humans busy in their days work. Across the square I saw one lady frail,\
  \ hunched over in a royal blue trench coat, her white hair capturing all the sunlight.\
  \ The man taller, and whose face I could only see a sliver of, turned his wrinkled\
  \ face toward her and beamed. It was the kind of smile that conveys you matter.\
  \ Between them was the single reusable, tattered bag of groceries they carried,\
  \ each of their old hands sharing the weight, which said it all. In that fleeting\
  \ moment, we were all captivating stories to which people interpret. It was a simple\
  \ image that curious day; the way the light fell and gleamed on the dew-drenched\
  \ leaves outside. It was the inescapable language spoken in that square, fabricating\
  \ the framework of being human that overcame me \u2013 the last thing I expected\
  \ to learn on the first day of my life here."
