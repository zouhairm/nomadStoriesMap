Text: "This was supposed to be the highlight of the trip. \n\nBut it rained.\n\nAnd\
  \ the rain wasn\u2019t usually such a big deal. It had rained every day of the trip.\n\
  \nBut \u2018twas all a drizzle, when you compare to today\u2019s rain.\n\nToday\
  \ the skies opened up. The rain came down powerfully, instantly soaking us. Penetrating\
  \ our thin summer clothes in a moment. \n\nAnd normally, I wouldn\u2019t have given\
  \ much thought to a rain of this intensity. It may have been an inconvenience, but\
  \ not a terror. \n\nWhen the rain began we weren\u2019t on the beach, on a walking\
  \ tour or on a hike. We were two platforms in on one of the highest zip lines in\
  \ the world. 11 platforms, from mountaintop to mountaintop. \n\nAnd since the rain\
  \ started only once we had progressed a couple of platforms. There were no emergency\
  \ exits, we just had to go forward. \n\nAnd as 15-year-olds, we were acutely aware\
  \ that we were the highest things in the sky. And soaking wet and covered with metal.\
  \ And we watched the beautiful and terrifying lightning bolts every few seconds.\
  \ \n\nSo as we flew through the pouring rain, so foggy and dense the world turned\
  \ white, we thought this might be the last thing we would ever do. \n\nAs American\
  \ teens, we had never been in a situation where the weather had control over us.\
  \ We could always master whatever the weather threw at us.\n\nBut to be at the mercy\
  \ of the rain, the lightening and forces of nature were humbling. Nature was not\
  \ something to stop you, control you, limit you, but something that was working\
  \ parallel and interwoven into your environment.\n\nAnd so as we tentatively strapped\
  \ ours harness to the metal that would take us through the sky, we took in all these\
  \ fears and observed our leaders where it was absent. \n\nAnd one by one made the\
  \ journey, one platform to the next. \n\nSometimes the journey is not easy or straightforward\
  \ even when it is supposed to be. Every possible obstacle can get in the way. \n\
  \nBut when you still manage to complete the mission despite all adversity, it inevitably\
  \ makes your stronger. \n\nOur group of 15-year-olds completed the zip line course.\
  \ Though cold, wet, anxious and not necessarily feeling happy or accomplished we\
  \ learned the important lesson that we can persevere, one platform at a time, and\
  \ can succeed. As long as we keep our focus. \n\nAs for the highlight of the trip?\
  \ I\u2019m not sure I can say that. But definitely affected our inevitable everlasting\
  \ relationship with Mother Nature."
