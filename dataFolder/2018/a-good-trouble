Text: "A travel isn\u2019t always as we imagined. Even with plans, somethings may\
  \ go different from what we expected. I learned that in particularly from my Rio\
  \ de Janeiro travel.\nIt started with the announcement of rock in rio. Me and some\
  \ friends get so excited. We buy the tickets from lady gaga concert, the flight\
  \ ticket, book the hostel in the region, planed the visit to museums and the ways\
  \ of get around the city. It was \u2018perfect\u2019 in our own way. We decided\
  \ to stay in a hostel near of Copacabana. Getting closer to the trip, things started\
  \ to fall apart\u2026\nThe hostel where we supposed to stay 'closed the door'. They\
  \ relocated us to another hostel but separated us. First we get a little concerned,\
  \ tried to move to one we could stay together but it wasn\u2019t possible. After\
  \ all, we find out the hostels were near of each other. \n On the date of travel.\
  \ I was with the nerves on the edge, (don\u2019t blame me, it was my first experience\
  \ with no father, only friends). I was so nervous that when the plane landed I thought\
  \ \"what now?\".\nAfter all anxiety, my friends and I went to the respective hostel.\
  \ It was high energy, much alike the places we see in the web media. After establish\
  \ ourselves, we went to our first \u2018commitment\u2019: take away our concert\
  \ tickets. As I arrived to the metro station (yes, the metro was the distribution\
  \ center of tickets) I saw the biggest line of people ever. No joke, we stayed more\
  \ or last six ours in it. also, I discovered that lady gaga was not performing at\
  \ the concert, and maroon 5 was the replacing her. Actually, it was great news for\
  \ me, I love them. \nAfter all these events, I thought the bad luck was gone...\
  \ it hasn't. in the middle of the Adams concert, I get my period. It was so ashamed,\
  \ had no tampons. Worst and best time of my life.\nSo even with all this unexpected\
  \ events (also car, party, baggage, schedule and lost in Rio problems, (a lot of\
  \ troubles that I didn\u2019t told you guys)), that are so likely to happened on\
  \ a travel, The last thing I expected was: this to be the greatest trip i had in\
  \ my life so far. \nI have no words to descrive the feeling of look at the sea for\
  \ the first time. It was so exciting, and i coldn\u2019t contain my tears. And the\
  \ same feeling of see Rio de Janeiro from the sky, inside of a plane or from the\
  \ top of P\xE3o de a\xE7\xFAcar.. Today when i look back, I woldn\u2019t do enything\
  \ different. I was with people that I love, in a most beautiful city I have ever\
  \ met. And all those incidental issues come to made this travel unforgettable."
