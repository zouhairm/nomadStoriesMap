Text: "The cock announced morning; several times. Followed by brisk sweeps of the\
  \ broom on the tiles marking the signs of a house waking up. I lay in bed listening\
  \ to the courtyard tap running; the water hitting the bottom of a bucket as the\
  \ first person went to shower. \"That will be a cold shower\", I thought, as I turned\
  \ over in bed, putting off getting up. \n\nLying-in isn't much of an option in Senegal\
  \ but I just went to bed a few hours ago, around the early morning call to prayer.\
  \  \nThe promise of a warm, filling breakfast raises me. Omelette or beans, I ask\
  \ myself as I step outside. The sweet cocktails from yesterday make the sun seem\
  \ even brighter this morning. With my face screwed up and squinting through one\
  \ eye, I greet the family around the courtyard. Who knew Christmas would be such\
  \ a party?\n\nWhen mass had finished at midnight the night before, my Senegalese\
  \ hosts had filed straight into the off-licence across from the cathedral to stock\
  \ up for the night ahead. It was their family's turn to host their friends this\
  \ year. The elderly mother had invited a small group of older women from the church\
  \ over and the sons were expecting a large bunch of their friends, all young men.\
  \ As the guests arrived into the courtyard, they sat in plastic chairs and chatted\
  \ in their separate groups. \n\nAt around 2am the daughters and wives of the house\
  \ brought out a feast. Huge sharing platters of grilled pork with salad and chips\
  \ were laid out for people to share. \nMealtime in Senegal is shared in the most\
  \ explicit sense. There is one plate for as many people as can fit around it. You\
  \ eat from the side closest to you and work towards the middle, where the meat is\
  \ laid. We sat four or five to a platter, making smaller groups dotted across the\
  \ courtyard in quieter conversation. \n\nWhen the food had been cleared and a few\
  \ more beers shared, the music was turned up and the courtyard became a dancefloor.\
  \ Senegal always finds a reason to dance. Blasting out Senegalese classics brought\
  \ the women to their feet and they took centre stage to lead the dancing. With each\
  \ song more people danced. The young men were thrilled to see their mothers dance\
  \ with so much energy. They joined in dancing with the women and encouraging them.\
  \ People didn't drift home until sunrise. I wondered how I could convince my own\
  \ family to have less presents and more dancing at Christmas.\n\nA knife and an\
  \ onion was shoved into my hand. \"Come on, we need to prepare the next meal\",\
  \ my Senegalese sister said."
