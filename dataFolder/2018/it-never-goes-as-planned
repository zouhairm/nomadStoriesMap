Text: "Words such as crazy, hilarious or unexpected would be the words I would use\
  \ to describe most of this adventures. Vail, state of Colorado in the United States.\
  \ The first time I ever saw the snow. I arrived late at night, rented a car and\
  \ drove to the resort; with the darkness of the cold night we didn't have the chance\
  \ to appreciate the beautiful town we just arrived in. The next day, we wake up\
  \ and rush to the parking lot. First reaction, \u201CWhich one is our car\u201D\
  ; that was the first mistake, we did not pay attention to our parking spot and the\
  \ beautiful view of a hundred cars covered on snow was not helpful. After going\
  \ one by one we finally found our. Next, remove the snow that covers the car; my\
  \ father had the marvelous idea of using water so it would drag the snow down; the\
  \ enormous second mistake of the day, in less than a second the front glass of the\
  \ car became a beautiful piece of thick ice. Next, we are driving with the head\
  \ out of the car. We spot a gas station hoping to find a person with winter knowledge\
  \ to help this poor tropical family. Lucky for us we found a worker of the gas station,\
  \ next thing we see is the man turning with the biggest hammer I ever seen and smashing\
  \ it to the front glass; in that very second all that passed to our minds was the\
  \ amount of money that the car renter would discount out of our credit card when\
  \ they see a gigantic hole on the glass. Luckily our tropical mind failed again\
  \ and the art piece of ice that was covering the glass was down and our front glass\
  \ came back to life. When you go to the snow for the first time all your mind pictures\
  \ is what the movies shows. Movies and reality can be two different worlds, they\
  \ don't teach how to deal with it; But that's what traveling is about new experiences\
  \ and unexpected events. traveling is the best school someone could ever get. Monuments,\
  \ museums, restaurants, food, natural beauty, excursions that's only one side of\
  \ the concept. Traveling has tough me more than just cultures and places, It has\
  \ teach me that the world is not just black and white, that there is shades of grey;\
  \ it made me open my mind and been thankful of what i am given.  However, the most\
  \ important is the people which is the element that makes the greatness of a country.\
  \ i am interested on their thinking, language, culture and history. Nevertheless,\
  \ what makes a trip out of the ordinary, are the personal experiences, the unexpected.\
  \ that's the reason why i choosed to tell my adventures."
