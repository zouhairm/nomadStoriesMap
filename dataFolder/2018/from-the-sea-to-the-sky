Text: "\u2018How many more minutes to the next base?\u2019 I asked my guide Atal with\
  \ a bated breath. He looked at his watch and replied \u2018another 20 mins\u2019\
  . Exhausted, I muttered \u201Cthat\u2019s going to be an hour for me\u201D and started\
  \ pushing my weary self up the steep trail ahead of me. \n\nI was on the scenic\
  \ island of Lombok, trekking the majestic active volcano Mount Rinjani. I come from\
  \ the lowest country (Maldives) in the world where my backyard is limitless waters\
  \ of blue. The only mountains I ever heard of were the volcanic ones that went extinct\
  \ thousands of years ago that formed Maldives.\n\nI never trained for the notorious\
  \ hike I was conquering.  Nevertheless, I took the challenge to test my limit and\
  \ to soak in the wonders of the wilderness. Little did I know that my body wouldn\u2019\
  t be able to take up the dare my mind intended!\n\nAs we reached the last base,\
  \ the scenery transformed to something of an exquisite valley. Just when I posed\
  \ for a photo, a mystic fog seized my scene, as if telling me the land is scared.\
  \ All of a sudden, the temperature dropped to bone-chill. The rookie in me had forgotten\
  \ to bring along a jacket. I quickly wrapped myself around one lent to me by my\
  \ thoughtful guide as he asked me to hurry up. \n\n\u201CNow is the hardest part,\
  \ it is going to get steeper, we need to reach the campsite before sunset\u201D\
  . I timidly looked around where I have to ascend, I could not see a path, a sheer\
  \ uphill climb in its stead. Already with a sprained ankle and several bruises on\
  \ my knee, I was at my very edge. Terrified, I gathered all my courage and commenced\
  \ treading on the rugged path covered in dry volcanic soil. \n\nI survived the mount\
  \ but the panorama in front of me was nerve-racking. The face of the mountain shielded\
  \ by big rocks! \u201CIt\u2019s not as hard it looks\u201D Atal replied calmly.\
  \ \n\nI was a warrior on a battlefield. I was about to taste the sweet glory of\
  \ victory. I couldn\u2019t give up now. I needed to keep going. I crawled on from\
  \ rock to rock, almost oblivious to my actions. After nearly 30 minutes I reached\
  \ the campsite. Hallelujah! \n\nExhilarated and awestruck, I was captivated by the\
  \ magical sunset of Mount Rinjani when Atal called me. That\u2019s when I saw the\
  \ astounding view of the active volcano surrounded by the crater lake. I stayed\
  \ overwhelmed by the revelation at my sight, speechless of how spectacular Mother\
  \ Nature is. A cheery voice inside me called out, \u201CThis is why you took this\
  \ hike, to experience the wonders of the Earth, to feel it, to embrace it and to\
  \ live it."
