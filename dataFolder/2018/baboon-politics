Text: "At this point, I had been in South Africa for a month working with Chacma baboons,\
  \ and my role was to follow the troop all day and record their behaviours. Every\
  \ day was controlled completely by the whim of 45 monkeys, and where they wanted\
  \ to be. I was accepted by the troop; we traversed mountains, forests and vineyards\
  \ together, and I hacked my way through dense shrubbery, climbed rocks and balanced\
  \ shakily on logs as I crossed rivers, all in the name of science. Their range covered\
  \ 27km2, and oftentimes it felt like the baboons were just touring me through the\
  \ whole landscape, like a bizarre initiation to the troop. We were trying to figure\
  \ out whether their roaming was influenced by local people\u2019s perspectives of\
  \ the troop, but along the way I became endlessly fascinated by baboon politics\
  \ and their relationships with each other, a fine-tuned balance of competitive and\
  \ cooperative strategies.\nThe longer I spent with the baboons, the more I understood\
  \ how human-like they were. Or how monkey-like we were. Every individual had their\
  \ own personality, regulated in part by their place in the social hierarchy, but\
  \ they all had levels of sass and 'je ne sais quoi' that led them to act like they\
  \ owned the entirety of South Africa. A month in to my time in the field I could\
  \ recognise each baboon; by their faces, their butts, the shape of their ears, their\
  \ behaviour quirks. For example if a lady baboon strolled along and tried to steal\
  \ a baby, that was Spock, and I knew that without even checking her left, Vulcan-shaped\
  \ ear. They were all named after fantasy and sci-fi characters for ease of identification,\
  \ and I\u2019d started to assign theme-tunes for them as well. Zurg (think Toy Story)\
  \ was the alpha male and he only had to stand up majestically in the corner of my\
  \ vision for \u2018Zurg a-ah, saviour of the universe\u2019 to blast through my\
  \ head (think Queen). \nI had begun to identify with the baboons, made possible\
  \ only by their acceptance of this little ol\u2019 two-legged primate that tried\
  \ to keep up with them and returned day after day. I felt their joys when a baby\
  \ was born, infants played, they discovered a patch of ripe fruit. And their fears\
  \ when we heard gunshots or people in the distance. I had knitted my reality with\
  \ the baboons, become one with the troop and landscape, and made a local connection\
  \ in a way that I could have only dreamed of. I took delight from the sunrise, always,\
  \ and greeted every day with wonder. Where would the baboons take me today?"
