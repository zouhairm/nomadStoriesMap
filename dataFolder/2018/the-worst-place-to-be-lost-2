Text: "\u201CAndy, what\u2019s up?\u201D I asked. His panicked face looks at me, \u201C\
  The compasses are broken and this map is wrong.\u201D You never want to hear these\
  \ words from the one person who\u2019s supposed to know where you are. \n\nWe were\
  \ lost, really lost. We were deep in the mammoth Guanacaste national park. Our party\
  \ consisted of ten teenagers plus a now defunct guide and I. We called our base\
  \ for help. They told it to us straight; trying to find someone in the jungle is\
  \ like finding a needle in a haystack. \n\nIt was hot, the kind of stuffy humid\
  \ hot that feels like a warm blanket if you sat still, but in the dense jungle,\
  \ it felt like an unwelcome trip to the sauna on the world\u2019s biggest hangover.\
  \ \n\nThe rainforest teethed with life as millions of species called out around\
  \ us. With less than 0.004% of the world\u2019s landmass, Costa Rica boasts 5% of\
  \ its species. It is a beautiful place but this was lost on us as the sun set, leaving\
  \ us to camp with the spiders, snakes and scorpions that littered the jungle floor.\
  \ We bedded down for an uncomfortable night\u2019s sleep. \n\nWaking at dawn we\
  \ used our dated map for guidance. With a nearby ravine acting as a marker, one\
  \ of the group scouted along this river to find the path we had missed. I jumped\
  \ across the ravine to try to cut a path to an old logging road marked on the map.\
  \ \n\nUsing blue tape to mark the way, I scaled the steep bank and began to cut\
  \ a trail, swinging a machete; cut, cut, cut. After five minutes, blue tape came\
  \ into sight; I\u2019d cut back across my own trail. It was impossible to keep straight\
  \ as every fresh-cut path immediately disappeared into the myriad of green foliage.\
  \ It was like trying to find your way in the mist. I made just 200m of progress\
  \ in an hour. I was running out of energy and morale was sinking.  \n\nThen, salvation;\
  \ I heard a cheer in the distance ringing out above the ambient jungle hum. It was\
  \ the group. They had found the trail. We were saved. \n\nYou have never seen such\
  \ a compliant group of trail walkers as we stuck to the trail like a train to the\
  \ tracks. Our relieved, re-energised group emerged from the jungle a few hours later,\
  \ to find ourselves at a deserted paradise beach, our destination. \n\nWe felt truly\
  \ privileged to be gazing upon such a breathtaking depiction of Costa Rica's beauty,\
  \ especially having nearly succumbed to its dangers just hours earlier. We ran into\
  \ the sea together. I remember floating in the water facing up at the sky, feeling\
  \ a sense of weightlessness that I\u2019d never felt before."
