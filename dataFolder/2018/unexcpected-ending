Text: I travelled to London, England, two years ago. I was just doing the common trip.
  I went to the Buckingham Palace, Kingscross, the Parliament... Like everyone who
  goes there. But then, the unexpected happened the last day of my trip. I missed
  the bus and I was alone, far from home, far from the city center. I did not know
  what to do, so I started to walk. I decided not to look back and just walk forward.
  I was feeling worried, but then all worries vanished when I found out a really cool
  place. No crowds were there, just nature. Bright and beautiful colours. I keep wondering
  how could a place like this be so "close" to such a big city. After being a while
  there, I left that wonderfull place and came back to the civilization. My luck was
  not over yet, because then I found a bus stop. I get on a bus which took me back
  to London and thanks to the nice people of the city, I found out how to be back
  at my hotel. This has been the best experience on any trip I've done. I learned
  that sometimes we have to lose ourselves to find the best outside or inside of us!
