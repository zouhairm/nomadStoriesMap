Text: "I scanned my phrasebook for the English word for \u201Cuomini.\u201D She giggled,\
  \ a childish wonder in her eyes, even though she had to be in her seventies. We\
  \ shared a small cabin on a train headed for Florence. I knew a little Italian,\
  \ the few phrases I\u2019d memorized in a pinch: \u201Cdov\u2019\xE8 il bagno.\u201D\
  \ Where is the bathroom? I gleaned the words I recognized and searched the book\
  \ for the rest. \nIt didn\u2019t matter. She was happy to talk, even if I could\
  \ only respond in monosyllables and mime. She was fascinated with me--an American\
  \ woman traveling alone, without knowing the language. From Savoca, a small Sicilian\
  \ village, she was on her way to visit her sister. A comparatively short journey,\
  \ but I could tell she was nervous about going alone. \nHer name was Sofia. She\
  \ asked me questions about America and where I\u2019d been. I was frustrated with\
  \ my inability to communicate with her, but she only smiled and patiently waited\
  \ for me to find the words. Never irritated that I butchered her language in stops\
  \ and starts. \nAfter she pointed out her village on the map, I told her I hadn\u2019\
  t been to Sicily, and she seemed genuinely surprised. \u201CDevi andare!\u201D You\
  \ must go, she said, as she placed a hand on my knee. From her, it felt like an\
  \ invitation.\n\u201CSi.\u201D I smiled back at her. \nSofia dug into her purse,\
  \ pulling out pictures. The ones printed on photo paper, a rarity in this digital\
  \ age. We all have smart phones, memories stored on hard drives. Sofia passed one\
  \ photo at a time to me, as if they were precious, fragile. \n\u201CSorella,\u201D\
  \ she said, pointing to a dark-haired woman with eyes that disappeared in a laughing\
  \ smile. With a hand upon her heart, she closed her eyes. Emotional at the thought\
  \ of reuniting with her sister. \n\u201CQual\u2019\xE8 il suo nome?\u201D I asked.\n\
  \u201CMaria.\u201D A choke in her voice at the mention of her sister\u2019s name.\
  \ \nWhen the conductor belted \u201CFirenze,\u201D Sofia jumped up and gathered\
  \ her things. My stop was Cinque Terre, so I would continue alone. \nHer cheeks\
  \ flushing red, she giggled. \u201CUomini Italiani\u2026serpenti! Attento!\u201D\
  \ She told me to watch out for Italian men. They are snakes.  \n\u201CAmericano,\
  \ anche,\u201D I said, with a wave of my hand. So are American men.\nHer laugh bubbled\
  \ out like champagne. She waved and scurried down the hall. \u201CAddio!\u201D\n\
  The cabin was quiet, her absence a stark contrast to the life she\u2019d brought\
  \ into the room. I rested my head on the window as the countryside floated past.\
  \ Just like the photographs Sofia had shared with me, I cherished our encounter\
  \ like a precious souvenir."
