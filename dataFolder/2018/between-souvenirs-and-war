Text: "Israel has been part of the news in the last couple of days. Images went around\
  \ the world with wreckages of an Israeli fighter jet spread over the area of the\
  \ Golan Heights. Those images touched me. Because just three weeks ago I was standing\
  \ right there, looking over the border to Syria in tears. \nJanuary 16th. In the\
  \ morning, I still had 194 kilometres ahead of me, 59 of which I would spend on\
  \ Highway 6 driving next to the Palestinian border wall. People said it would take\
  \ me out of \"the bubble\". A few minutes after having left Tel Aviv I realized\
  \ what this metaphor meant, which the metropolis was associated with. It meant leaving\
  \ a modern area that in so many ways felt like never having left Europe. It meant\
  \ leaving a place where associations one had towards Israel like the conflict between\
  \ two religions were not present. \nDuring the 194 kilometres, I was mesmerized\
  \ by the stunning landscape marked by olive trees and the contrast between a complete\
  \ dry and suddenly blossoming area. At the same time, I was confronted with another\
  \ part of Israel\u2019s reality: the presence of military. And as a German, who\
  \ rarely sees machineguns, it meant the presence of danger. \nAfter a two-hour drive,\
  \ an apparently insignificant street sign welcomed me to Golan. From that moment\
  \ on, and from the international perspective, I was driving on Syrian territory.\
  \ But the presence of the white-blue-striped flag and Hebrew as the main language\
  \ on street signs were the proof of Israel having taken control over the area in\
  \ 1967. \nIn that area, the streets were almost empty. Driving past military camps\
  \ the mountains of Golan appeared under a dense cloud cover which didn\u2019t reveal\
  \ the viewpoint I was driving to. When I parked the car on Mount Bental the next\
  \ Syrian town was eight kilometres away. Eight kilometres that separated me from\
  \ a country that has been suffering from war and destruction for almost seven years.\
  \ And suddenly, standing on one of Israel\u2019s most popular viewpoints, I found\
  \ myself crying. Crying in between the tourists who were posing for their selfie\
  \ with the UN soldiers and Syria in the back. I realized that I was lucky to be\
  \ standing on this side of the border, because I could leave any time. And those\
  \ people behind the border couldn\xB4t. They were still fighting for their lives\
  \ while we were standing there, taking selfies, drinking coffee and buying souvenirs.\
  \ And in that moment, there was nothing I could do but cry in between soldiers\u2019\
  \ statues, bunkers and tourists."
