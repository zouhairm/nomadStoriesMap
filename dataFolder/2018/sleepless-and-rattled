Text: "I unbuckled my seat belt with trepidation as we touched down at the Charles\
  \ de Gaulle Airport, Paris. It was my first solo trip, that too, to an unfamiliar\
  \ country whose language I didn\u2019t understand. The flight was horribly late.\
  \ I couldn\u2019t use the local bus service to get to my nondescript youth hostel,\
  \ anymore. I\u2019d no idea what to do next. And this was the pre-Internet-on-phone\
  \ era. Passengers scurried out of the plane while I was still unsure what I was\
  \ doing in the City of Love, alone. Stories of muggings & disdain of locals against\
  \ English speakers, swirled in my brain faster than a flushed toilet. But here I\
  \ was, trying to deal with the grief of a recently ended relationship. I quickly\
  \ followed the trail of passengers, just so I wouldn\u2019t be alone. CDG looked\
  \ less like an airport & more like an office closing for the day. It was dimly lit\
  \ & there was no staff around. Ultimately all the passengers arrived like a large\
  \ noisy family, to a counter selling Metro tickets. There was no other way to go\
  \ anywhere except for the M\xE9tro de Paris. \nI bought a metro pass & queried those\
  \ around me about my youth hostel - Le d\u2019Artagnan. To my dismay I needed to\
  \ change 3 lines & walk with my luggage to get there. I had no clue how to identify\
  \ which line/station/exits to take. Luckily, I found an English speaking local headed\
  \ to my first interchange station. I gratefully tagged along. He asked if I had\
  \ a metro map, pointing to his. I stared at the congested mesh graphic, which seemed\
  \ to depict my confounded brain & said no. He gave me his. May be having seen an\
  \ unnerved look on my face, he added that he could accompany me to my next change\
  \ station too. I was relieved. My confidence was a bit restored & I profusely thankful,\
  \ as he led me to the platform to take the last train.\nI exited the metro system\
  \ well past 11pm. The streets were empty. I started walking on one that was my best\
  \ guess. It turned out to be right & I finally made it to the hostel! \nI checked\
  \ in to a girls dorm with 16 beds. The women seemed to be from all over the globe,\
  \ going by faces & accents! Tired after my adventures, I drifted off to sleep quickly.\
  \ Till I woke up to a chilling scream from a nearby bunk.\n\u201CWhat happened?\u201D\
  \n\u201CWas ist passiert?\u201D \n\u201Cque pas\xF3?\u201D\n\u201CEstas bien?\u201D\

  s ok, only a nightmare\u201D\nThe voices shot out in the dark. All at once. In languages\
  \ I couldn\u2019t comprehend. And didn\u2019t need to. In that moment sisterhood\
  \ provided comfort. I was alone, yet not."
