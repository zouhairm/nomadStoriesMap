Text: "I ran the final eight hundred yards to my tent at a dead sprint. In the last\
  \ four miles, I had discovered that my \u2018rain jacket\u2019 was water repellent\
  \ and not water resistant. It was forty degrees and I was soaked\u2026and cold.\
  \ I was sprinting to my tent, because I had left off the rainfly. I first had to\
  \ rescue Trevor\u2019s tent. The wind had blown it precariously close a glacial\
  \ stream at the base of Mount Mageik. I got to my tent and all of my worst fears\
  \ were true. Everything was wet. Imagine someone taking your sleeping bag and dunking\
  \ it in a swimming pool. Then imagine them doing it with all of your spare clothes,\
  \ your food, and your stove. Shit. Was the rain going to stop? As I squeezed the\
  \ bag against my body, water streamed onto the ground. I remember Trevor walking\
  \ up. His phone was extended in front of his face, taking a selfie video. \u2018\
  Is your stuff wet?\u2019 He asked. \u2018Yes.\u2019 I said with a monotone. \u2018\
  Get your stuff packed, we need to get moving.\u2019 I knew he was trying to be nice.\
  \ \u2018How bad is it?\u2019 He asked. I repeated myself, \u2018Get you stuff packed,\
  \ we need to get moving.\u2019 With rain still coming down, we did not have the\
  \ luxury to make small talk. We were playing a game with hypothermia and if we failed\
  \ to make the right decisions, we might lose that game. The weather looked fine\
  \ as we started on the last four miles to Novarupta, the site of the largest volcanic\
  \ eruption of the 20th century. Novarupta blew its top in 1912 and was thirty times\
  \ larger than the Mount St. Helens eruption of 1980. Novarupta created the Valley\
  \ of 10,000 Smokes, a forty square mile area covered with seven hundred feet of\
  \ pumice and ash. That means the ash piled higher than the Washington Monument.\
  \ To get to Novarupta you take a plane from Anchorage to Brooks Camp in Katmai National\
  \ Park. You then take a bus twenty miles through the Alaskan wilderness to arrive\
  \ at the Valley of 10,000 Smokes. From there it is fourteen brutal miles on pumice\
  \ to the site of the eruption. Hiking on pumice is somewhat similar to hiking in\
  \ a sandbox, with a forty-pound backpack. The weather had turned on us. It prevented\
  \ us from getting to Novarupta, it had soaked my body and all my possessions.  It\
  \ was 3pm and we had twelve arduous miles of hiking before us. Between the rain\
  \ and Trevor wasting time I was unsure if we would make it out, I was at the edge\
  \ of my wits. I put on my backpack and prepared myself for hiking in a sandbox and\
  \ crossing glacial streams with my already bitterly cold feet."
