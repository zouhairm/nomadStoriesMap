Text: "The sun began its slow and sultry decent over the old navy docks at Skaramagas\
  \ refugee camp. Sounds and smells of evening meals being prepared from caravans\
  \ and makeshift stalls filled the air, but I waved by welcoming invites from open\
  \ doors and continued. \nI\u2019d been teaching English to a group of young adults\
  \ and pondered the day\u2019s lesson as I reached my destination: the end of the\
  \ dock, where grey cement gave way to the lapping blue waves of the Mediterranean.\
  \ Great cargo ships anchored in the bay, before a backdrop of mountains kissed by\
  \ the setting sun. \n\u201CSophia,\u201D someone called, \u201CDo you want to swim?\u201D\
  \ \nI turned and saw one of my students, a sixteen year old girl named Khawla. \n\
  \u201CNot today,\u201D I joked, \u201CHow do they get back up?\u201D I added, after\
  \ seeing a young man run and jump off the dock. He swam a few metres out and joined\
  \ about a dozen people playing in the water.\n\u201CThere\u2019s a rope,\u201D Khawla\
  \ said.\nI\u2019d been told a young child had drowned a few months earlier and I\
  \ shuddered. \nBefore I could collect myself Khawla took my arm and steered me toward\
  \ the other end of the dock, \n\u201CI\u2019m going to see my father, he\u2019s\
  \ fishing. Will you come?\u201D\nI nodded and we walked together.\nKhawla\u2019\
  s father was a kind man with hard-working hands. He smiled when I told him that\
  \ his daughter was a good student. She had missed a lot of school, he said, but\
  \ he was proud of her for wanting to go to university.\n\u201CWe move,\u201D he\
  \ told me, \u201CFrom war in Syria,\u201D he pointed at his arm and made a gesture\
  \ of an explosion.\nHolding out his arm for me to examine, I gently pressed the\
  \ place above his elbow. \nUnder his scarred skin I felt something hard like metal.\
  \ I looked at the old man in shock and confirmed my thoughts with Khawla. Her father\
  \ had shrapnel stuck in his arm.\n\u201CYou must see a doctor!\u201D I pleaded,\
  \ and offered to go with him to a clinic. He refused adamantly, saying he had gone\
  \ already and was told he may have to lose his arm so he never went back.\nHe explained\
  \ to me that he will be okay because his family is safe. \nTogether, we watched\
  \ the last golden rays grasp the horizon.\nThe last thing I expected was to see\
  \ children playing in the water or Khawla\u2019s father patiently waiting by the\
  \ docks with a fishing line in one hand and his injured arm by his side. \nIt takes\
  \ a special kind of courage to pass each day, displaced, with memories of war and\
  \ trauma, in limbo to an uncertain future; but the sun does rise again and the resilience\
  \ and hope of the human spirit overcomes."
