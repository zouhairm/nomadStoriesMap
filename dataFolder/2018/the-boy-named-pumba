Text: "Growing up in a South Africa divided so much by poverty and injustice, as a\
  \ wealthy, privileged white boy, I learned to see only the misfortunes of those\
  \ not as well off as me. I learned only to see what was missing in their lives,\
  \ the things I possessed that they would never know of.\nThis point of view, though\
  \ its essence still holds fast to this day, was forever altered by a young boy whom\
  \ fate had decided to place in my way.\nBy chance it happened that my family and\
  \ I were on our annual holiday in East London, along the South African coastline,\
  \ when we encountered Pumba, who, to the best of my recollection, was the son of\
  \ one of the maids that worked in the chalet we had rented for the week. Though\
  \ his youth should have allowed him to be as free as we were in those days, he was\
  \ always to be found following his mother or helping with some task around the house.\
  \ \nThe memory of how we became acquainted with him on a personal level, let alone\
  \ how we came to be invited to his family home after knowing him for only a few\
  \ short days has long since been forgotten. Yet there we stood, my brother and I,\
  \ ready to be thrust into a world which we knew, from our upbringing, was filled\
  \ only with misery and silence. That morning we had walked from our chalet through\
  \ waist-high grass, along a path which had been formed by generations of people\
  \ travelling the same route. When the house came into view our hearts sank at the\
  \ sight of the lone, building, no larger than the sitting room of the house we had\
  \ just left. We began to fear for what we would encounter upon entering the house.\
  \ We need not have worried. Although it was true that what we found were people\
  \ living in poverty, the contentment which flowed through that home surpassed all\
  \ our expectations, the family being far happier with the small joys which they\
  \ possessed than many people have in their vast fortunes. Though surrounded by a\
  \ thatch-rooved, mud-walled hut, what we saw, what they wanted us to see, was them\
  \ as people, the rich tapestry and culture of the family. They did not want pity,\
  \ nor did they see themselves as needing it. I learned that day that people such\
  \ as Pumba and his family cannot and should never be categorised and judged based\
  \ on labels such as \u201Cpoor\u201D.\nWhat has become of Pumba since our departure\
  \ I do not know, but I remember thinking that this boy, despite all the challenges\
  \ that he would have to face in his life that I would never even be aware of, in\
  \ that moment, was the luckiest boy alive."
