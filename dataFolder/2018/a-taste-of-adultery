Text: "A hundred devotees were chanting an ancient Hindu Mantra inside the temple\
  \ of Dagduseth Ganpati and while I joint my hands in prayer, I could not believe\
  \ that this spectacular temple is surrounded by India\u2019s largest red-light district:\
  \ Pune\u2019s Budhwar Peth.\nAfter the prayers got over, we rushed out the temple,\
  \ wore our slippers and started on-foot for Shaniwar-Wada, a palace one kilometre\
  \ away.\nWe were half-way through when Anurag caught me looking at a stout woman\
  \ sitting at the entrance of a dingy two-storied house. She was chewing a paan and\
  \ her lips were bloody red.\n\u201CShe\u2019s a Chachi,\u201D Anurag said. \u201C\
  You know who a Chachi is?\u201D\n\u201CUmm. . . Manager?\u201D\n\u201CExactly. The\
  \ senior-most lady of the brothel. An ex-prostitute herself.\u201D\nGirls in mini-skirts\
  \ and short-jeans flirted with the passers-by and many others stood inside narrow\
  \ alleys that shot inwards from the main street. The brothel-houses were so shanty,\
  \ they'd collapse over one another any day. This commercial sex-market was a myriad\
  \ of other businesses as well \u2013 Electronic shops, book market, hardware, retail,\
  \ provisional-stores \u2013 and damn! \u2013 a school too!\nI was in Pune for first\
  \ time, and the presence of a sacred temple, a business hub and a huge sex-market,\
  \ all at the same place had already amused me. There was more to come!\nAt Shaniwaar\
  \ Vada, we bought our tickets and stood in queue to enter inside this stone-palace\
  \ built by Peshwa Bajirao in 1730s. I love historic places for the stories they\
  \ harbor inside them, and Anurag agreed to bring me here.\n\u201CShould not we take\
  \ a tour-guide along?\u201D\n\u201CNo need,\u201D Anurag said, \u201Cthere\u2019\
  s not much to explain!\u201D\nI could not understand what Anurag meant, but when\
  \ I stepped inside, Shaniwar Vada was no more a historic monument. Every window\
  \ of this palace framed a romancing couple sitting underneath it. Hands clasped,\
  \ head resting on the other\u2019s shoulder - Shaniwaar Vada was more a couples\u2019\
  \ point than a place of history.\nIn India, PDA is often subdued by the elderly,\
  \ and the youths in love seek refuge in historic buildings. Here, the locals do\
  \ not visit, let alone their parents! And tourists aren\u2019t much a menace. Every\
  \ Indian city has a lovers\u2019 point, and Pune had Shaniwaar Vada.\nI knew I had\
  \ to head for the exit when I walked inside one of the archways and discovered a\
  \ boy making love to his girl, pinned against the wall of this huge palace.\n\u201C\
  Peshwa Bajirao would be very happy\u201D, I thought. That day in Pune taught me,\
  \ that sex and love can be found in the most unusual places."
