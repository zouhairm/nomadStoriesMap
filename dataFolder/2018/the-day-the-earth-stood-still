Text: "A new day was underway, as I awoke from a deep, comfortable sleep in my dorm\
  \ room bunk. I was beginning my final full day in Asia, after touring the region\
  \ for the previous six months. In 24 hours, I was set to depart the steamy metropolis\
  \ of Kuala Lumpur, catching a flight to Honolulu, where I would finally fulfill\
  \ a lifelong dream to visit Hawaii before finally returning home to Ohio. I was\
  \ thrilled to spend the day buying tacky souvenirs for my loved ones, touring the\
  \ city by foot, and enjoying a few more Malaysian milk teas.\n The twelve hour time\
  \ difference with my friends back in the States left me with plenty of catching\
  \ up to do each morning on social media. But on this day, as I unlocked my phone,\
  \ I was met with a wave of startling messages. At about 8:30am, on July 27, 2017,\
  \ I learned that one of my closest friends had attempted suicide the night before.\n\
  \ At an AirBnb in Bali, surrounded by a group of girls who were not much more than\
  \ acquaintances, my college roommate was suffering after an unsuccessful attempt\
  \ to end his own life. Waldo was both the inspiration for my world travels, and\
  \ and my mentor along the way. Every time I doubted whether I could buy the one-way\
  \ ticket abroad, he was there to provide encouragement. Whenever I faced adversity\
  \ on the road, he counseled me from afar. Waldo had been there for me time and time\
  \ again; but today, he needed me more than ever.\n Thus began one of the most stressful\
  \ and terrifying days of my life. I paced back and forth in an empty room at my\
  \ hostel for hours, on and off the phone with the girls who had been with Waldo\
  \ the night before, and with both Waldo\u2019s parents and my own, back stateside.\
  \ After one brief call with Waldo himself, where he declared his intentions to try\
  \ again that night, I could no longer get ahold of my travel companion. As the day\
  \ melted away, I knew I needed to take action, if I wanted to save my friend\u2019\
  s life.\n At 4:00pm, using his passport information from months prior, I booked\
  \ Waldo a one-way ticket from Bali to Kuala Lumpur. When he would not answer my\
  \ calls, I rang the hostel he had moved to directly, and notified Waldo of his flight\
  \ later that night. I pleaded, I begged, I poured out every bit of love and emotion\
  \ I had for Waldo. After a lengthy pause, he gave me a reluctant promise that he\
  \ would catch the flight to KL.\n In that moment I knew my next stop was not going\
  \ to be the sunny beaches of Honolulu, Hawaii. I was going to get Waldo home."
