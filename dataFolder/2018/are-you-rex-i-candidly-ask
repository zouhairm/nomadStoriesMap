Text: "As Michelle drives her dad\u2019s old Toyota Coaster across the Nullarbor,\
  \ taking Rex to his final resting place, old memories are flooding back.\n\nIt\u2019\
  s early March when I find myself in Alexander Bay, Western Australia. From the campsite,\
  \ a path leads to a 9 mile wide open bay. The Easterly wind gently shuffles the\
  \ green coastal heath. My toes sink into the purest white sand I have ever seen,\
  \ while my eyes wander between emerald patches and the deep blue of the Southern\
  \ Ocean. Breathing deeply, the ocean breeze fills my lungs, true serenity.\n\nOn\
  \ my right, there\u2019s a gathering on the rocks, people are having a lively chat\
  \ about fishing gear and fish size. Standing tall amongst them, a slim, older bloke,\
  \ wearing \u201Csunnies\u201D and the iconic Akubra hat, holds his catch of the\
  \ day.\n\u201CAre you Rex?\u201D, I candidly ask.\nEveryone looks at me, the fisherman\
  \ turns, surprised, \u201CAre you looking for Rex?\u201D \n\u201CI met a Swiss couple\
  \ by a telephone booth in Esperance\u201D, I answer. \u201CTheir enticing description\
  \ of Alexander Bay brought me here,\u201D \u201Ca secluded campsite, a white sandy\
  \ beach with a couple of people fishing and living the life. A gem, few know about.\u201D\
  \ They added, \u201Cif you come across Rex, say hi from Franck and Carole.\u201D\
  \nHere I am, taking a chance by asking the man with the big fish.\nIs it intuition\
  \ or sheer luck? I had just met Rex, the keen fisherman.\n\nThe fish of the day,\
  \ a 2.5\u2019 Pink Snapper is now cut and shared between all. Acknowledging my curiosity,\
  \ Rex offers to take me fishing. I had never fished before so I accept. After lunch,\
  \ we board his 10\u2019 inflatable dinghy. One hour later, and a bucket full of\
  \ herring, we store the boat for the night. Time to learn how to fillet fish.\n\n\
  During the following days, Rex teaches me about fishing tackles, rods, and reels.\
  \ Cast, reel in, repeat, sometimes fight and land a fish. We have fun, laugh, talk,\
  \ open up, and develop a lasting friendship.\n\nBy coming here, not only I have\
  \ discovered a spectacular place, I also met an inspiring man who introduced me\
  \ to angling, a thrilling and skillful activity. Whether trolling, bottom fishing,\
  \ or casting off the beach, within 2 weeks, I caught 10 different species.\n\nBut,\
  \ most importantly, Rex allowed me to experience the ability to address one of our\
  \ most basic needs, feeding oneself. There is something organic, an overwhelming\
  \ joy in hooking and sharing your catch. A unique feeling I will be forever grateful\
  \ to him for."
