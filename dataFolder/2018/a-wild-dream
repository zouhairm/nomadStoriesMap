Text: "I stand in the middle of the jungle, surrounded by gorillas, and it feels like\
  \ walking right through a dream. When I was planning this trip to Rwanda, I knew\
  \ the magnificence of the landscapes, lakes, forests and the 300 gorillas living\
  \ on the steep slopes of the Volcanoes National Park would amaze me. This was just\
  \ beyond everything I could have ever imagined. \n\nA dense mat of vegetation, huge\
  \ trees, lianas and thick mist give this unreal place a magical atmosphere. I still\
  \ have trouble catching my breath after a 3-hour hike in the rain, slipping in the\
  \ mud and getting back to my feet, pulled by the rangers escorting our small group\
  \ of international tourists. \n\nMy heart is beating wildly as I realize most members\
  \ of the large Susa family surround us, engrossed in their daily activities: babies\
  \ climbing trees or clinging to the backs of their mothers; a greedy male sitting\
  \ alone skillfully shucking his food; groups of 2 or 3 walking around like guardians.\n\
  \nMesmerized by their shiny black fur and their every move, I don\u2019t realize\
  \ one of them is coming right behind me until I see a ranger instructing me to push\
  \ back. \u201CNot closer than 5 meters from the gorillas\u201D they said during\
  \ our briefing. But the truth is, gorillas are making the rules here, not us. I\
  \ hold my breath and try to merge into the nearest bush, on tiptoe, staring down\
  \ at the indifferent female brushing my legs. I could almost reach out with my hand\
  \ to touch her.\n\nMy body and mind don\u2019t know how to react to this once in\
  \ a lifetime adventure and swing from deep excitement to fear, especially when one\
  \ of the males starts thumping his chest. I worry for a fight but he finishes his\
  \ drumming and nothing happens. \n\nAs we move deeper into the jungle, trying to\
  \ capture every moment in our memories and our cameras, a massive silverback climbs\
  \ up on a fallen trunk and strikes for a pose. I look directly into his eyes and\
  \ I am struck. No violence. No hate. No fear. \n\nDespite everything they have endured,\
  \ they still accept us in their home, tolerating our presence with respect and dignity.\
  \ The last thing I expected was to feel so small in their presence. Not because\
  \ of their size, but because they naturally demonstrate two values we seem to have\
  \ forgotten: tolerance and harmony. \n\nHiking back down, I wonder how long we enjoyed\
  \ their company. I can\u2019t say. Time just stopped. As I walk out of the dense\
  \ bamboo forest to find daylight again, it feels like awakening from a deep slumber.\
  \ Why did I have to wake up?"
