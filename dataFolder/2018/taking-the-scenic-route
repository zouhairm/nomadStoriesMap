Text: "Somewhere south of Pueblo, Colorado, we abandoned the interstate for the county\
  \ roads. We were on a road trip from Denver to Santa Fe, but the monotony of I-25\
  \ was not satisfying any wanderlust. We decided to take the scenic route.\n\nHave\
  \ you ever wandered down a gravel road, just to see where it goes? I'm the type\
  \ of person to whom a Dead End sign is an invitation. I immediately am curious to\
  \ know where the road ends, and what exactly is at the end of it.\n\nYou never know\
  \ what you might find when you take the scenic route. You might discover some long-forgotten\
  \ pieces of Americana, like a dilapidated old General Store, clapboards straight\
  \ out of the Wild West, or a tumbleweed cemetery of stones inscribed in the 1800s,\
  \ leaning against wrought-iron fences. \n\nPerhaps, while you're standing in that\
  \ cemetery, a freight train will come curving along the edge of the valley, passing\
  \ you by on its journey toward the desert plains. Perhaps you will follow a road\
  \ that leads to a place called Sunshine Valley to take in what will you know can\
  \ be nothing less than a spectacular vista.\n\nSomewhere along the scenic route\
  \ is where the adventure starts."
