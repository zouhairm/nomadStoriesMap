Text: "India is stumbling over itself in a gruelling game of tug-of-war between tradition\
  \ and tomorrow, distending the rope of a resilient past in either direction. And\
  \ my impression of Rajasthan was that it just doesn't want to play.\n\nIn the state's\
  \ village of Kanoi, I met Musa Khan and his glorious moustache. He twirled it skyward\
  \ in salutation to the Gods for affording him the privilege of facial foliage denied\
  \ to lower caste men. Dressed in a pathani suit and turban, he caressed Kesariya,\
  \ a camel that would transport us into the depths of the Thar desert. The quadruped\
  \ sported more piercings and psychedelic clothing than the average Coachella attendee.\
  \ But sartorial traditions in Rajasthan have long rebelled against the harsh heat\
  \ of the desert, while simultaneously conforming to age-old diktats. Khan's wife\
  \ walked over to us, her face confined behind a ghoonghat: a veil. In tow was their\
  \ insolent granddaughter Faiza, who scurried around the scarce shrubbery, twirling\
  \ her imaginary moustache to mock Musa\u2019s upturned status symbol.\n \nWe were\
  \ 22 miles from Jaisalmer, a city whose yellow sandstone architecture is hegemonised\
  \ by one of the last living forts in the world. A fourth of the population of the\
  \ old town lives in the citadel, among overpriced caf\xE9s, imitation canons and\
  \ exuberant leather craftsmen. Just outside is a state-sanctioned bhaang shop, getting\
  \ patrons stoned enough to forget that the Indo-Pak border is nearby. But conflict\
  \ had silenced the chaos of Jaisalmer that day. Padmaavat, a film about the self-immolation\
  \ of a mythical Rajasthani princess had been released, despite violent protests\
  \ by the state's Rajput community. The city was closed, but talk of the film in\
  \ hushed tones wafted through the streets. A revolution in whispers.\n\n\u201CAre\
  \ you married?\u201D Musa asked as we rode to the dunes in the distant silence of\
  \ Kanoi. \u201CNo,\" I replied. \u201CI got married at 15,\u201D he said. \u201C\
  Is that the norm?\u201D He ignored the question, telling me instead how Faiza\u2019\
  s rebellion inspired him. \u201CWe'll drink vodka together,\u201D he said. \"I bury\
  \ bottles in the sand so no one finds out.\" \n\nAs the sun set over the dunes,\
  \ we unearthed our contraband and watched the sky fill with stars, mirroring the\
  \ intricate trails of beetle footprints in the sand. Musa injected the night with\
  \ a cheery insurgence. \u201CI really want to watch Padmaavat,\u201D he slurred.\
  \ \n\nTurns out the sands of the Thar concealed more renegades than Russian spirits.\
  \ And maybe Rajasthan was playing tug-of-war after all."
