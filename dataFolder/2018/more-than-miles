Text: "Battling jet-lag with Colombian coffee, our bus was headed toward a small village\
  \ North of Chimborazo. There were two routes- a wide bridge big enough for our bus,\
  \ or a very narrow trail along the mountain side- absolutely too small for our bus.\
  \ As Darwin\u2019s law predicts, the seemingly sufficient bridge had collapsed a\
  \ day before we arrived. Suddenly wide awake, we were faced with the dilemma: how\
  \ do we get to the job site, now a two hour drive? What do we do for the next ten\
  \ days? \n\nQue the smallest pick-up truck I\u2019d ever seen, stopping at the distraught\
  \ looking Canadians. \u201CNeed a drive?\u201D \n\u201CYessir.\u201D\n\u201CBack.\u201D\
  \ He pointed- and sure enough, the back of his truck dragged as he drove us- two\
  \ hours to the village we\u2019d been headed too. The path was so narrow breath\
  \ was held simultaneously. We were five bodies sitting in the bed, and five more\
  \ on those laps- two lucky lives in the front seat. Edmund sang loud enough and\
  \ joyously enough that we\u2019d share wary smiles, almost forgetting a complete\
  \ stranger was taking us across a unforgettably steep mountainside. \n\nWe\u2019\
  d arrived, and Edmund stayed. We\u2019d piled bricks and Edmund sang. At the end\
  \ of the day, he\u2019d drove us two more hours home. For the next ten days, at\
  \ six am we\u2019d meet Edmund at the base of the collapsed bridge, and we\u2019\
  d listen to him sing as we drove up a mountainside. He would stay, build, and sing\
  \ us home. We\u2019d leave money for gas, bring lunch, and tell him we could rent\
  \ a car. But he\u2019d shake his head, \u201Ctomorrow\u201D. \u201CTomorrow.\u201D\
  \ \n\nTen days passed, and as we\u2019d uncurled ourselves from the truck bed for\
  \ the last time, Edmund asked us, \u201CTomorrow?\u201D And we shook our heads.\
  \ \n\u201CHome.\u201D Edmund smiled his gap-tooth smile, and under his breath he\u2019\
  d started to sing. One by one he grabbed the boy\u2019s hands and gave them a shake,\
  \ pulling them in for a clap on the back and a kiss to the temple. He enveloped\
  \ each girl with a hug and a kiss to the forehead. We\u2019d hardly spoken, but\
  \ we sang together, and traveled, and dug and built and swore and held our breath.\
  \ \n\nEdmund offered the grace ten entitled Canadians needed to be humbled. Life\
  \ is lived fully and richly when it\u2019s lived together."
