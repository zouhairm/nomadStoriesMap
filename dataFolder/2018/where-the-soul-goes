Text: "Where the Soul Goes\n\nWhere does the time go?  How did I arrive at this age,\
  \ with no hobbies, little passion and no goals? \n \u201CAnyone want to hike into\
  \ Skoki with me this summer?\u201D she asks.  Me!  I do!  Can I come?  How does\
  \ that happen, sudden clarity, joy and inspiration?  As if a dream just appeared\
  \ before me to guide me, support me and honour me in my journey of self.\nSkoki\
  \ Lodge, nestled in the Canadian Rockies, picturesque, rugged yet sublime, gourmet\
  \ food and duvets, yet no electricity or running water.  Heaven!  Ok, how do we\
  \ get there? Hike.  Um, ok.  How far? It is about 13 or so kilometers, lots of it\
  \ up.  WHAT?!   A group of 13 gorgeous souls, in all shapes and sizes, ready to\
  \ submerge ourselves in the beauty of nature for two nights and three days, seize\
  \ the joy of comradery and friendship.  \nSteep climbs, harrowing descents, rock\
  \ chimney, cliff exposure, blazing sun, howling winds and torrential rain, and that\
  \ is just the hike in!  \u201CHow will I ever get home?\u201D I ask myself.  I am\
  \ exhausted but energized.  I am terrified but so alive.  I am unsure and yet so\
  \ certain.  One foot in front of the other, the same way you arrived here, at this\
  \ stunning gem in the wilderness.\nTo reach inside, to find that place that will\
  \ take you wherever your heart desires, is quite magical.  And so my life unfolds.\
  \  To morph from an aging wife, mother, employee and volunteer into this soul that\
  \ flourishes in nature, breathes in the joy and fresh air, and peacefully turns\
  \ the page, onto a new chapter of one\u2019s life.  \nAnd the adventures continued\
  \ close to home and far away.  More gorgeous souls, more steep climbs \u2013 as\
  \ if I really knew what steep was! - harrowing descents, and so on and so on!  Hiking\
  \ has nurtured my soul like nothing else and has invigorated me to challenge many\
  \ aspects of my life.  However the greatest joys of traveling are the self-knowledge\
  \ and learning that appears in the most interesting of places."
