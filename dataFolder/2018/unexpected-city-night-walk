Text: "The story I\u2019m about to tell begins in a train. Me and two friends, Laura\
  \ and Carlos, were travelling from Bologna to Florence. We were in Bologna for just\
  \ one day, having arrived in the morning from Munich in a night train. Night trains\
  \ are great but if you don\u2019t book a bed, you might not sleep very well. That\u2019\
  s what happened to us; needless to say, we were really tired after our day in Bologna,\
  \ before heading to Florence in the evening. We wanted to stay awake so the three\
  \ of us had a coffee while in Bologna. All fine so far, except my dear friend Laura\
  \ is epileptic. That means, she should never drink coffee. So there we are in the\
  \ train, all very happy and cheery, when suddenly Laura starts having a seizure.\
  \ In all the years since we\u2019ve met her, she never had one. But the lack of\
  \ sleep plus the coffee had their effect. All I remember was seeing her eyes go\
  \ blank and her mouth start to open, I immediately realised what was about to happen,\
  \ while Carlos was still talking to her normally. I quickly put some napkins inside\
  \ her mouth, to prevent her from biting her tongue when the real seizures started.\
  \ They started after a while, she fell on the floor shaking. We tried to protect\
  \ her head, and that was all we could do; we just had to wait for it to stop. That\
  \ went on for about five, maybe ten minutes. Everyone on the train was looking,\
  \ some people ran away, others were screaming. Then came the ticket inspector, who\
  \ only made it worse. He didn\u2019t speak a word of English, and had no idea what\
  \ to do, so he just stood there staring, speaking Italian to us and calling even\
  \ more attention. He did call an ambulance though, which was waiting for us in Florence.\
  \ The paramedics entered the train and put Laura in a stretcher, then took her to\
  \ an ambulance. They only allowed one person to go with her to the hospital, so\
  \ Carlos went and I stayed behind. There was another medical car, with four free\
  \ seats, but they refused to take me. So I had to cross the city, at night, searching\
  \ for the hospital. I got to see the main attractions of Florence that night, which\
  \ was kind of ironic. Hours later I finally got to the hospital, and at about 4\
  \ in the morning Laura was free to go, having made all necessary exams. Then we\
  \ had to go to the camping site we had booked, on top of a hill\u2026 walking\u2026\
  \ carrying our bags and with a friend who was almost too week to even walk. But\
  \ we made it, we rested and the next day we were ready to continue our trip!"
