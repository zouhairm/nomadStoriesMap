Text: "It was a warm and hazy morning as I approached a bridge on my bicycle. Pulling\
  \ over halfway across I waved behind to my buddy who just noticed it too- California\
  \ State Line. We stood underneath the rusted metal sign as it clanked against loose\
  \ screws. Visually it wasnt all that, but for us it was everything. Since leaving\
  \ NYC we crossed 16 state lines, and this was our final one during a long bicycle\
  \ and skateboard trip across the country. \nCrossing the Colorado River that flowed\
  \ below, we continued west on the narrow shoulder of i8 as the landscape changed\
  \ to desolate and sandy hills- and greeted by a merciless headwind that swayed our\
  \ bikes while whipping sand in our faces. After five months on the road this was\
  \ one of the more dangerous situations, and we quickly turned into the next gas\
  \ station for refuge. We were planning on covering 80 or more miles today and so,\
  \ a little defeated, we just sat there twiddling our thumbs and watching tumbleweeds\
  \ dance across the dunes for the rest of the day. Surprisingly there was more to\
  \ this town of Felicity, CA than a few scattered homes and trailers. It was founded\
  \ in 1986 by a famous french-american skydiver, and contains an odd assortment of\
  \ structures including a large sundial, pyramid, and actual staircase sections from\
  \ the Eiffel Tower. It was officially dubbed the Center of the World and thought\
  \ maybe we werent stuck in the middle of nowhere after all. \nThe wind hadn't stopped\
  \ and the sun was now starting to quickly set. On our last beer of the bench, someone\
  \ approached us after parking their motorcycle across the lot. Cliff was middle\
  \ aged wearing a black leather jacket, young in the eyes and looked like our kind-\
  \ weathered and traveling. We struck up conversation and eventually set up camp\
  \ nearby. He noticed our skateboards and with a shot in the dark asked if we knew\
  \ an old professional skater- John Grigley. I froze, and as my eyes widened I responded\
  \ in bursts of exclamations. I've known John for 6 years now and was even at his\
  \ teenage daughters' birthday before starting this trip! Turns out Cliff was at\
  \ her birth, and has known John for most of his life. For whatever wild reason,\
  \ the three of us met in the 'Center of the World' and shared a friendship with\
  \ someone decades apart. We sat there in disbelief, pretty much alone in the southern\
  \ California desert and continued laughing and sharing stories around the fire-\
  \ reminding ourselves that magic things happen only when you surrender all expectations."
