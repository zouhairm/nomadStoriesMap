Text: "The leaves are wetly green. The roads are white and dusty at first and then\
  \ red as the dirt changes on our way to the park. The hammock threads are every\
  \ color threaded together. The lodge we\u2019re staying at is in a town at the edge\
  \ of Rincon de la Vieja national park. \n I could write about the volcanic mud we\
  \ rubbed on our bodies and tried not to get on our bikinis in the natural springs,\
  \ the way our horses smelled when we stopped at the entrance hut to the park, or\
  \ how emerging from the forest canopy into a wide open field on a zip line makes\
  \ you feel a little bit like God if you can forget for a moment that you\u2019re\
  \ strapped in with brightly colored nylon straps. But none of these compare to the\
  \ charm of visiting a San Jorge clandestina at night. This little town with only\
  \ about twenty-five people living in it may not even be San Jorge proper. And isn\u2019\
  t that the greatest pleasure of traveling? Finding yourself in a place you do not\
  \ know the name of because it exists on no guides?\n One evening, sick of the bad\
  \ pasta at the lodge and the bowing waiter saying con mucho gusto every time he\
  \ approached our table, my friend and I took one of the men who worked at the lodge\
  \ up on his offer of visiting a bar just down the road. It\u2019s not really a bar,\
  \ he said, no license or anything.  \n When we entered the small wooden house, a\
  \ man was emcee\u2019ing a round of karaoke. He took one look at us and screamed\
  \ into the microphone, oh beautiful babies. With every song a few people would get\
  \ up to dance: an old woman with a young gay man, a married couple, plump in the\
  \ middle, a man with creaky knees wearing an Italia zip-up sweatshirt who chose\
  \ my friend as his partner and me, dancing with our dreadlocked guide who had brought\
  \ us to this little house of lightness. We picked beers up out of coolers on the\
  \ ground\u2014the price to be tallied later on honor\u2014and were offered slices\
  \ of the sugary cake that had been presented during a tearful speech from mother\
  \ to son and back again as they, miraculously, had the same birthday. \n We walked\
  \ ourselves back to the lodge that night, in almost pitch black, no streetlights\
  \ to guide us. The old man with the handkerchief came riding by on his horse. Buenas\
  \ noches, he said as he raised his hand in greeting. For a minute, I could imagine\
  \ I lived in this little town in the shadow of a volcano and would go tomorrow to\
  \ buy fresh cheese from this man on his horse or catch the bus to town to buy a\
  \ cake for my mother\u2019s birthday."
