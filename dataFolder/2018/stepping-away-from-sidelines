Text: "I wasn\u2019t expecting to be seated in the middle seat in the middle row of\
  \ plane on a 16 hours flight. Well, when you don\u2019t complete online check in,\
  \  cross your fingers and hope for an aisle seat, I guess that\u2019s what you end\
  \ up with. And yet, the last thing I expected was to spend an evening flight conversing\
  \ with two quite interesting women rather than binge watching movies, reading and\
  \ trying to twist myself into yoga-ish poses in an attempt to get some sleep. \n\
  \n\nThe silk saree clad paatti (grandmother in Tamil) introduced herself as Shanti,\
  \ and was on her way back from her annual vacation of four months from India, during\
  \ which she had visited Mumbai, Chennai, Agra, Mathura and Bangalore. She lived\
  \ by herself in San Jose, was traveling back to US alone, and was quite happy playing\
  \ a game of cards online and sipping a red wine, all at the age of seventy five.\
  \ As we got talking, she told me about her knitting projects, daily bridge games\
  \ at the community center and the tatting she had finished while waiting for the\
  \ flight.\n\nWhen I turned to my right, there was Barbara, in her forties and returning\
  \ from her first visit to India, a one month trip with a group of strangers, and\
  \ telling me how she couldn\u2019t wait to go back alone to visit the places she\
  \ missed this time. A compliment about her earrings got her talking about how she\
  \ had picked it from a street vendor in Peru, on one of her solo trips to South\
  \ America. She told me about how she enjoyed these solo trips and couldn\u2019t\
  \ wait for the next time she would visit India.\n\nNow, this might seem nothing\
  \ extraordinary for a seasoned traveler. But for me, someone in her thirties, who\
  \ had deeply ensconced herself in her job so much so that she had no hobbies, did\
  \ not travel for pleasure and had fitful sleep worrying about the firefighting to\
  \ do at work the next day, these women were a revelation. Especially so, when mortality\
  \ had presented itself in the form of news about a batch mate of mine passing away\
  \ due to cardiac arrest.  \nThese women had let caution go to the wind and done\
  \ what they wanted with their life. \n\nThese women, bold and beautiful in their\
  \ unique way, had told me silently that I had to live, not just exist. They had\
  \ told me without speaking that life is short, at best, and it shouldn\u2019t be\
  \ wasted cementing myself inside a cubicle for long hours.  They had, in their simple\
  \ way, breathed into me a desire to live and step away from the sidelines and into\
  \ life, and for that, I\u2019ll always remember them."
