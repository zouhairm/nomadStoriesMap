Text: "Screaming my head off and jumping to my feet out of fear was not entirely what\
  \ I envisioned when I planned my trip to Thailand. But alas here I was, in a very\
  \ traditional room, on a farm, in a small town a few hours away from Bangkok city.\
  \ My enemy right now is a rather large lizard that keeps popping his head out form\
  \ an opening in the ceiling. I\u2019m not completely outside of the room because\
  \ on the other side is about ten dogs. \nA few days ago, I was leaving the airport\u2019\
  s cool and almost familiar environment, stepping outside to catch a taxi when I\
  \ was hit with a wave of hot air. \nThe road driving out into Bangkok was so busy.\
  \ Thirty minutes later and the roads don\u2019t seem to be clearing at all. As I\
  \ soon came to know that the hustle and bustle and continuous traffic was a norm\
  \ in Bangkok. As was the heat and the thousands upon thousands of people.\nI had\
  \ the opportunity to immerse myself in the Thai culture as I was living with a friend\
  \ in Bangkok for several days. I had the opportunity to eat new and sometimes strange\
  \ food. \nBangkok\u2019s temples were absolutely stunning as it glistened in the\
  \ sun because it was made from real gold. The Grand Palace was truly grand with\
  \ its beautifully structured buildings and mesmerising statues.  Some walls had\
  \ murals of the royal family history.\nI was so excited to be going to the Flower\
  \ Festival, where I got to learn about Thai culture and traditions and especially\
  \ learn about the royal family. Pattapong delved into the history and I was most\
  \ amazed by Thai silk. It took many weeks for the women to complete a single garment\
  \ as it was still traditionally made. \nAyutthaya was an incredible little town\
  \ outside of Bangkok. I unfortunately had to ride a bike on the busy freeway of\
  \ the town, in order to get to our destination. I was definitely not happy about\
  \ this.\nNeeding a break from the city, I headed to a town a few hours away. Here\
  \ I could finally enjoy the ocean and experience the natural wonders that Thailand\
  \ has to offer. The beach itself was beautiful and warm. \nI was at Pattapong\u2019\
  s aunt\u2019s farm out in the country side. It was here that I came face to face\
  \ with the terrifying lizard creature. I eventually got over my fear of the lizard\
  \ and accepted that I was in its world. \nI was definitely torn to be leaving Bangkok.\
  \ I was not expecting to have such a crazy, scary, yet wonderful adventure. I gained\
  \ new experiences, met up with old friends and even made some new ones. \nThis is\
  \ truly a venture that I soon won\u2019t forget."
