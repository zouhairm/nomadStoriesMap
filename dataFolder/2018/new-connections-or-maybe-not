Text: "So I spent three month in Vietnam and one week of those 3 month in a city called\
  \ Kon Tum, back in 2017. I thought to myself \"I should use my time wisely, so I\
  \ will teach some english to local children.\"\nI called a number I found on the\
  \ internet, and 2 hours later I got picked up by a kind, elder looking guy called\
  \ Mr. Hien, sitting on a scooter. He was holding a Helmet into my direction which\
  \ seemed to have a broken strap. That was defnititly not the safest encounter I\
  \ know, but in comparison to what comes after, this was safe, safer then durex.\
  \ \nWe drove up to his school. As it turned out he was the director, and that evening\
  \ I started to teach. I was not prepared at all and to be honest I didn't think\
  \ the guy supervising me would just leave me in front of all those lovely kids the\
  \ first day?! So coldbloded... He was sipping tea, while I had to figure out some\
  \ way to entertain the kids. We ended up folding paper into a ball, so they could\
  \ through it to a classmate, who then had to introduce him- or herself and ask me\
  \ a question before throwing it to someone else. Quite inventive right ? At least\
  \ the girls seemed to have liked it, I figured since they asked for my facebook\
  \ and whether I was single or not. Luckily I was or maybe not?\nWell here is why\
  \ not:  The time I spent there with those children and the teachers was amazing,\
  \ to some of them I even still write today, but there was this one encounter close\
  \ to midnight in the hotel lobby of where I lived. My room there was moldy, so I\
  \ tried to reduce the time in there to a minimum, and as often, a local just started\
  \ practicing his english by talking to me, at least I thought so. Since we both\
  \ seemed to be hungry, he invited me to go eat at a restaurant that was still open\
  \ at those odd hours. And as we ate I came to tell him, that my room was quite uncomfortable.\
  \ So he offered me to stay at his. \n\"A nice american styled house with TV\" I\
  \ remember him saying. Since travelling is about experiences, saying YES to new\
  \ things is important. I felt a little weird I must admit, I mean checking out of\
  \ the hotel in the middle of the night to sleep at a random guys house. \nMhm...\
  \ I know crazy. And it is about to get crazier! \nQuick summary:\nTaped windows\
  \ , no TV, only one small mattress in the middle, no furniture nothing; Yes we shared\
  \ that little thing, actually I slept on the ground, waking up every 2 hours, because\
  \ he was hugging me repeatedly..., but well we travel to widen our horizon right?\
  \ The wiser I am now ;)"
