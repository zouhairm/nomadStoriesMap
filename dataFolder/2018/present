Text: "I always knew I didn't want to be the typical medical student.\nI knew I wanted\
  \ to become a Doctor, someday, of course, although it had taken me a big effort\
  \ to give up all my willingness to dedicate my life to artistic\nactivities that\
  \ inspired me much more than reading hundreds of pages of Anatomy. That is the reason\
  \ why, while I was coursing 3rd year of Faculty I decided to fly away.\nIn Europe,\
  \ by fortune specially for me; since I haven't given up any type of chances to do\
  \ international programs; we have the option to ask for diverse scholarships which\
  \ allow us to travel and work in a Hospital for a while. When I got the chance,\
  \ of course, I asked to go to the rarest place I saw was possible, which was \"\
  El Duque de Caxias\", near Rio du Janeiro in Brazil. \nAlthough it may sound topical,\
  \ I loved Latin America from the moment I stepped on it. I felt Portuguese was in\
  \ some way \"a minha lengua madre\". I was stunned by the music all over the place,\
  \ no matter what happened around, leaving no place to negativity, just focalising\
  \ in the good vibrations with their Samba and Bosa Nova; their hundreds of incredible\
  \ artists who had emerged from nothingness to making those who walked down the streets\
  \ just happy from listening to them. It is true it was dangerous, I could feel it\
  \ in the same way you feel it when someone stares at you without even looking.\n\
  I was almost robbed twice; it was absolutely my fault though: I just liked to leave\
  \ the place in Niteroi where all the students went after our surgeries, take the\
  \ ferry to cross Guanabara Bay under the stars and walk the city of colours. Brazilian\
  \ people would never leave you alone anyway! They would ask you where you were going\
  \ and walk with you; pay you a couple of cacha\xE7as, and beers and show you the\
  \ greatest place to listen and participate of their dances in incredible reunions\
  \ like the one in Pedra do Sal, where after their normal day routine garotos with\
  \ garotas would go to forget it all for a couple of minutes while being invaded\
  \ by the deepest of their \"saudades\". I then learnt, to forget it all! To live\
  \ and let go.\nI was amazed by that beauty, geographical, musical and social; that\
  \ explosive combination of Favelas; where natural rules where the only regime that\
  \ set control on top of those hills where everything flowed so fast and so slow\
  \ at the ame path, coexisting over the richest streets right under; the mix of Santa\
  \ Marta and the Leblon, where everything was possible if you were able to pay the\
  \ prize."
