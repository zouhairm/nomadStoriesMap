Text: "As soon as I stepped off the minibus, I was swarmed. I had just spent several\
  \ hours on a rowdy, twisted road from Tbilisi to the village of Stepantsminda in\
  \ the cradle of the Caucasus Mountains. A small flock of elderly ladies lay in wait\
  \ at the bus stop, fishing for tourists to stay in their guesthouses.  A matron\
  \ with a deeply corrugated face and strands of silver hair peeking out from a navy\
  \ kerchief gently pulled me from the crowd. She commenced a well-rehearsed pitch\
  \ in a mixture of Russian and Georgian. Although I spoke neither language, I surrendered\
  \ quite easily and followed her up a cobblestone path, passing homogenous masonry\
  \ homes with rusted tin roofs. She continued to make small talk, not caring I could\
  \ not understand her, and after a few turns we arrived. Inside, a young raven-haired\
  \ woman with a narrow face and obsidian eyes greeted me in English and showed me\
  \ an austere, Soviet-style room with peeling blue paint. She barked, \u201CDinner\
  \ at six!\u201D as I hastily grabbed my camera and squeaked past the gate. Behind\
  \ the house, the looming, gnarled face of the mountains scowled down on the village,\
  \ hoarding a bubbling mass of clouds. I set off for a distant stone monastery near\
  \ a glacier-capped peak, passing several mottled cats and a boy shoeing a chestnut\
  \ mare. \nI returned to the village at sunset, a few minutes before dinner. As I\
  \ strolled past the houses, I arrived at a troubling realization. In my brash enthusiasm,\
  \ I had neglected to pay attention to which specific house I had bolted from earlier.\
  \ I walked down street after street, but everything looked the same. My initial\
  \ frustration turned increasingly grim. I was alone, I didn\u2019t know the language,\
  \ and it was now pitch dark. By luck, I stumbled upon a different guesthouse, and\
  \ a stout middle-aged woman in a white sweater shuffled out to help. Unfortunately,\
  \ my descriptions were too generic to be useful. Suddenly, I remembered the blaze\
  \ of photos I took when I first scampered out. After viewing a few, she snapped\
  \ her fingers and motioned for me to follow. Minutes later, I stood before a familiar\
  \ raven-haired woman.  \u201CSorry, I got lost,\u201D I sheepishly mumbled. \u201C\
  How did you get lost? This is not New York. There are ten houses here!\u201D Humbled,\
  \ I joined the rest of the guests 40 minutes late for dinner. Afterwards, as we\
  \ were retiring for the evening, the elderly matron grabbed me and spoke forcefully.\
  \ I looked to the young lady for a translation. \u201CShe said you better not be\
  \ late for breakfast.\u201D"
