Text: "Yes, I admit it: I have the eternal traveler syndrome, it's an illness that\
  \ when you are at home you have the impetuous need to catch another flight and when\
  \ you are out discovering other places, inevitably you feel longing for your friends\
  \ and family. \"\xBFWhy they can not be here, with me?\"\nYou get used to the hankering\
  \ and you keep idealizing: yes, you take a piece of all the places you have visited,\
  \ you take a piece of all the things that you have liked and you create, as if it\
  \ were a puzzle, the perfect place in your imagination, with all the people there.\
  \ \nBecause does it exist the perfect place?  Probably I need a trip to get the\
  \ answer. I feel lost..  My town doesn't help, I need my antidote, I'm getting crazy\
  \ here, with all the people following the same pattern, with an 8-hour job\nI am\
  \ in my thirties, I've spent most of my life traveling and I wonder if I will ever\
  \ stop. My friends are having kids, enslaving with mortgages and all of them look\
  \ happy, sometimes I envy this healthy conformism because I can't do it, I just\
  \ don't feel it.  Where I am flying? I completely forgot\nOh yes, I am going to\
  \ Buenos Aires. I haven't been yet, I am so excited to learn tango, to drink mate,\
  \ to enjoy the amazing Argentinian asado or chorip\xE1n but there is this annoying\
  \ voice inside who keeps telling me the solution is not the place the solution is\
  \ inside me. \xBFHow can I find it?  The flight is just eternal, I am anxious, on\
  \ the one hand I don't want to be in a place where I do not belong just as a tourist,\
  \ because I was never a tourist, I am a traveler, I am a seeker.  Being a seeker\
  \ is much more complicated than you think. You have to be honest with yourself and\
  \ to unlearn everything you've learned. You need to trust and re-believe in magic,\
  \ in intuition.  I' m ready for that?\nIn Buenos Aires the vibes are good, the smells\
  \ have life and even though I am tired I decided I want to go to Boca, willing to\
  \ be immersed in their colors, their music, their people. I sleep like a happy traveler\
  \ baby\nDelicious early morning, rays of light entering through the windows of my\
  \ little and cozy hotel in San Telmo. Ready to move around, this time I'm heading\
  \ to Palermo, the trendiest and coolest neighborhood.  What is happening to me?\
  \ My heart is pounding, is it anxiety? No, it's not that, I know I'm accelerated\
  \ but I feel happy, I'm fine. I'm not going to go into the loop to think about what\
  \ to do with my life, I'll discover. I know. Omg, everything makes sense now. To\
  \ be continued?"
