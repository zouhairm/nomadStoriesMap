Text: "My taxi dropped me in the North of Bogot\xE1, a world away from the grimy faded\
  \ glory of the central districts. Brand new luxury apartments sat on wide avenues\
  \ lined with palm trees and department stores. One of these apartment blocks was\
  \ the home of Leo and Ricardo, two Argentinians whose hospitality I was to abuse\
  \ for the night on the advice of a friend back in Europe.\nI pulled up to the gated\
  \ complex, feeling very conspicuous and student-like with my backpack strapped to\
  \ my back. The doorman was expecting me and immediately whipped the backpack off\
  \ my back and onto his own, viewing me with some curiosity whilst doing so. He led\
  \ me through the marble corridors and into the lift to the apartment. A look of\
  \ relief visibly passed over Leo\u2019s face on answering the door. Our mutual friend\
  \ must have been sketchy on details as Leo had clearly being viewing our meeting\
  \ with even more trepidation than I had. Reassured, he whisked me into the house\
  \ with typical South American hospitality, sitting me down with a beer and asking\
  \ if I wished to go out that night. I made a non-committal response and with that\
  \ it was settled, we were to go out that night, because it seems South Americans\
  \ will always go out, given the choice.\nAs we began planning the night, Ricardo\
  \ immerged from his room. The two made an amusing pair \u2013 Leo impossibly tall\
  \ and Ricardo impossibly short, the opposites in appearance but clearly old friends.\
  \ Ricardo immediately announced that if he were to go out then we must go to \u2018\
  the hotdog place\u2019 in Zona T because they sold the best hotdogs in the world\
  \ and he needed a hotdog. Then he sat himself down and tried to shoo Leo off to\
  \ the shower like a long-suffering wife. Rather than oblige, Leo went and fetched\
  \ some red wine that he had bought back from Argentina. He had placed 13 bottles\
  \ of wine in his suitcase on the last visit home and was rather proud, both of this\
  \ and the fact that only one bottle broke. Luckily that one bottle was a white wine\
  \ and so did not stain his clothes. At this point in time I was not a lover of red\
  \ wine, but according to Leo, it was pretty special stuff (he hadn\u2019t even tried\
  \ it yet \u2013 it being from Argentina seemed enough of a guarantee of its quality),\
  \ so I thought I would sample it. And as that bottle and the next disappeared Leo\
  \ and Ricardo set about teaching me Argentinian slang, which would of course be\
  \ of absolutely no use to me during the hours ahead, in what would be my first,\
  \ and certainly, funniest night out in Colombia."
