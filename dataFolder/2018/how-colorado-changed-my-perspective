Text: "Hey, do you see that storm over the top of the mountain? Said my friend Adam,\
  \ I replied yeah, so what? He said let's take a hike right when it gets here. I\
  \ looked at him and and my other friend Dustin for a second and thought, what? Then\
  \ I said why would we hike in the rain? I then realized as soon as I said it.. Why\
  \ not hike in the rain? It was 77 degrees outside and perfect in every way. I've\
  \ had the amazing opportunity to travel much of Europe, Southeast Asia and South\
  \ America and the U.S. but nothing in life so far has been quite this beautiful.\
  \ Dillon Lake which was where we set up camp had went from a glimmering base of\
  \ the mountain, to a still dark cloud that hovered above. So we set off on our hike,\
  \ next to the lake. Soon we felt the mist from the showers not far from us, and\
  \ smelt the fresh rain, it had a soft intensity to all the senses. You could smell\
  \ wild lavender and see the purple everywhere. The ground scattered with wild strawberries\
  \ every place you looked. As we joked about being struck by lightning none of us\
  \ actually cared. It left us just staring at the beauty set in front us and every\
  \ once in awhile we would catch a glimpse of each other being mesmerized. It was\
  \ a setting from a dream. As we trekked on we came to a giant rock on the shore\
  \ of the lake with a man in a yellow parka trout fishing we stared on as he cast\
  \ out his neon yellow line into the water. He noticed us and waved.Over us the towering\
  \ peaks of the Rocky Mountains, and in front is a vast body of water so clear you\
  \ could see the lake trout swimming about. In that moment we had to stop and just\
  \ soak it in for a second. We sat down by a pine tree that's trunk was twisted all\
  \ the way up. \"Beautiful\" I said, it's amazing what nature is capable of. While\
  \ sitting down on the edge of the shore I felt something on my arms and legs, I\
  \ looked down and I was covered in large black ants. I reacted quickly, \"Ahhhh\
  \ geez!!\" I exclaimed and brushed all of them off while running up a steep incline\
  \ that I could have never gotten up if it wasn't for the adrenaline. After getting\
  \ all the ants off my body I walked back down to my friends laughing so hard they\
  \ could barely breath, and saying \u201CI can't believe you just sat down on an\
  \ ant hill\u201D. After taking some jokes from them we continued forward. By this\
  \ time the rain had come onto us full force and we were loving every second. This\
  \ trip taught me to love the things society tells us to hate. Thanks for reading!\n\
