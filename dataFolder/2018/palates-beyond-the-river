Text: "It was soothing to come out of the human filled coach to the refreshing atmosphere\
  \ of the rainforest. The condensed water that invigorated the air tamed the heat.\
  \ Along the way, I discovered that our tour guide Peter is passionate about three\
  \ things: the rainforest, his home for the past years; sugar, the crop that invades\
  \ his native Bundaberg, and rum, a by-product of the last. He owns a curious palate.\
  \  \n\nOnce Peter had finished his cigarette, he was ready to lead us into the lush\
  \ heart of the forest. Wandering along the green and dense jungle, fascination invaded\
  \ our young faces. He was pointing the strolling crabs, the sliding caterpillars,\
  \ and the colorful moths before he released an excited gasp. We noticed him grabbing\
  \ an ant and directing it to his mouth. He invited us to snack at them. I followed\
  \ him. Who needs lemon tarts when you have ants? The citrus of the ants was refreshing.\
  \ I had heard that insects are the food of the future, and I could savor that acid\
  \ statement in my mouth. \n\nAfter this gastronomic discovery, Peter and I embark\
  \ on a conversation about the sweet, the bitter, the raw and wild nature of food\
  \ beyond the Daintree River: an appetizer for lunch. He takes us to a local shop\
  \ that offered kangaroo, emu and crocodile burgers. I teamed up with a newly met\
  \ friend and chose a platter of three sliders. It was an army of mosquitoes against\
  \ two female backpackers. The price was the exotic meat. Small bites allowed by\
  \ the swarm let me taste the chewy but sweet Roo, the grainy and bland Croc, and\
  \ the chicken-like tender flesh of the Emu. I fail to choose a favorite and I give\
  \ it to the atmosphere of invertebrates buzzing around my meal. \n \nAs a pick-me-up,\
  \ Peter embarks us on a river cruise to meet the Rainforest\u2019s biggest predator.\
  \ One with a palate less selective than mine. As we approach, a basking crocodile\
  \ gives us an uninterested look and a quick glance of his sharp canines. Economizing\
  \ his energy, he consents a close exploration of his hoarse and gridded skin. I\
  \ come to realize that moments before that same flesh has gone down my throat. \n\
  \nOn our way back I indulge on Peter\u2019s storytelling of the innumerable species\
  \ coexisting in the area, being part of the same ecosystem. I connect with his concerns\
  \ about human\u2019s impact on the purity of the land he calls home. Little did\
  \ I know that a day in the rainforest would put the food chain in a different perspective.\
  \ A short epicurean experience lead by a foodie that made me aware of my role in\
  \ it."
