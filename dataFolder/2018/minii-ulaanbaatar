Text: "Our group arrives back at the Anujin, not one of us having seen another in\
  \ eight days. My first order of private business is to peel off my jeans for the\
  \ first time since a sun-faded truck shuttled me away from the dancing colors of\
  \ Sainshand\u2019s fountain and into the pebbly eastern regions of the Gobi. When\
  \ I see red instead of blue, my hands reach for the back of my thighs and meet scabflesh\
  \ just as cracked and dry as my leather saddle. I close my eyes and with my fingers\
  \ explore the solid mass of scab the way Kublai might memorize Marco Polo\u2019\
  s maps. I thank the horse who carried me and the Mongolian saddle that had injured\
  \ me unawares, for teaching me to bleed without pain. \nAt sixteen, I had not been\
  \ ready to bathe with buckets of river water, right before my family of strangers,\
  \ exposed to the goatherd, uncovered beneath the great yellow eye of the Gobi. \n\
  Back in Ulaanbaatar, the city of the red hero, in an Anujin hotel bathroom, pipe\
  \ water touches my skin again. An uncountable sea of stars and burning blue tails\
  \ follow the glowing arm of the Milky Way down the drain, followed by five hands\
  \ reaching into a yellow bowl for portions of steamed goat meat. Night-hours of\
  \ song thousands of miles opposed meeting for the first time; a Cyrillic paperback,\
  \ missing its cover and many of its pages, in the brown hands of my brother taking\
  \ shelter in the shade of the blue truck; my surrogate father who teaches me how\
  \ we sheer our sheep and how we teach our herd the way. \nThe water does not wash\
  \ away my scabs, and I do not ask it to. I do not pick my scabs, and they don't\
  \ itch. They just exist there, in the same way the dust of the Gobi found asylum\
  \ in my pores, my hair, the folds of my clothes. I've already washed away the desert.\
  \ I can't evict these, too. I charge no rent, asking only when they leave with the\
  \ seasons that they leave behind a scar. To remind me that the edge of the world\
  \ and the edge of myself were once synonymous. \nThe next day, I spend 400 tugriks\
  \ at a convenience store, and I dye my hair purple. I wear my plume proudly to the\
  \ Naadam Festival and cheer for a wrestler who flaps his arms like an eagle, in\
  \ victory.\nWhen I have gone through baggage and met my family in an exit lobby,\
  \ my twin-sister cries. How am I to tell her I cried the night before because I\
  \ knew I was returning? When my senior year of high school begins, my hair has faded\
  \ from purple to pink. I do not cut it. This reflection reminds me the whole world\
  \ waits to fit into one body."
