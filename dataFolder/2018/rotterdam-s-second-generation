Text: "All of this Couchsurfing thing was pulling the shit out of me. I travelled\
  \ a lot during my life but after the \u201870s hitchhiking with your thumb up is\
  \ dead cause of people start to be aware of the existence of murderers, drugs addict,\
  \ rapists.. and all of this is increased by the first lesson that every mother teach\
  \ to her kids: \"never talk to strangers\".\nI naively followed the \"low cost\"\
  \ plan of Alice, hence she booked the couch of this guy, Walt, an artist of somewhere\
  \ who was living a Rotterdam. We left Bruxelles on a bus with a six-pack of beer\
  \ as a greeting for Walt. At the Rotterdam's central station I saw Walt for the\
  \ first time: he was dancing and beatboxing with his roommate, Dooby.\nWe were burst\
  \ into an artist\u2019s place. Walt and Dooby were in the middle of their twenties:\
  \ Walt was a street singer who was waiting for the next audition for \u201CThe Voice\u201D\
  , while Dooby was a musician who works in a coffee somewhere in the city.\nWe spent\
  \ the night singing, eating Mc Donald\u2019s burger and laughing about some Walt\u2019\
  s experience as a backpacker in Italy. Some of Walt\u2019s friends joined our show,\
  \ too. None of them was originally from Rotterdam: they were all part of what they\
  \ called \"Rotterdam's second generation of immigrants\". Everyone in that room\
  \ was a proud mix of Rotterdam's subculture and memories of a land which they saw\
  \ only through their parents' stories. I fall asleep hugging a guitar and Nemo\u2019\
  s film playing on Walt\u2019s PC.\nThe next day Dooby took us to see the city. We\
  \ walked among tiny streets and bikes, while we were eating one of the typical street\
  \ food of the city:  fresh sardine with onions. Rotterdam is a perfect marriage\
  \ between the usual grey landscape of a business city and a kid's drawings: in front\
  \ of the main square there is this big hotel with the shape of a cruise ship, and\
  \ next to it a big tower which gives me the idea of pencil that wearing lots of\
  \ sunglasses. Behind them, there were the famous yellow cube houses, which we visited\
  \ for just three euros. He took us to \"The market\": this giant and colourful horseshoe\
  \ building which collected a maze of stands and restaurants from all over the world.\
  \ A kind of food's museum with a hippie atmosphere. It was full of coloured cheese:\
  \ the blue one was lavender flavoured, and the green one was goat cheese with mint.\
  \ I also asked for the pink one, but the man who was selling them started to speak\
  \ with a woman that I believe was his first love. And besides, Rotterdam has got\
  \ a new story around every corner."
