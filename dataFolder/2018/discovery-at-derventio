Text: "\u201CAnything else I need to know?\u201D I stammered, feeling entirely unworthy\
  \ of the profound task ahead. My ripped jeans and pink gardener\u2019s kneepads\
  \ didn\u2019t help.\n\nMark thrust a yellow bucket and mud-caked trowel at me and\
  \ grinned. \u201CJust let me know if you find any human remains,\u201D he replied\
  \ in his broad Northern brogue.  \u201CWe need to report those to the police.\u201D\
  \n\nWe stood in a sodden sheep field on the outskirts of Cockermouth: Lake District\
  \ market town, birthplace of William Wordsworth, and site of early Roman fort settlement\
  \ Derventio Carvetiorum. A moody bank of grey roiled overhead, but to the east a\
  \ patch of pale blue (\u201Cjust enough for a pair of sailor\u2019s trousers\u201D\
  , as the Brits say) held faint promise. Birds twittered unseen in damp hedgerows,\
  \ and chemical deodoriser from the Port-a-Loos mingled with the loamy aroma of disturbed\
  \ earth in a heady concoction that smelled like adventure.  An enthusiastic backpacker\
  \ with a penchant for history, but zero experience or qualifications, I was ready\
  \ for my first archaeological dig.\n\nI claimed a corner of the shallow scar of\
  \ the trench, kneeled, and awkwardly wielded my trowel. Fellow volunteers, mostly\
  \ local retirees in khakis and shouting schoolchildren armed with notebooks and\
  \ lunch pails, welcomed me jovially before barraging me with questions about life\
  \ back home. Layer by layer, I peeled back the dense earth in excited anticipation\
  \ of its secrets. Visions of enviably Instagrammable discoveries \u2013 amphorae,\
  \ coins, and (hell, why not?) grinning human skulls \u2013 crowded my mind.\n\n\
  At noon, a sleety rain cut through the landscape and filled the trench with murky\
  \ brown soup. Finally, and without warning, my trowel caught on a hard object lodged\
  \ in the mud.  Mark, the excavation leader, approached to witness me lift it triumphantly\
  \ from the ground. It was a small, misshapen brown nugget, which didn\u2019t look\
  \ much like anything\u2026except maybe a fossilised Roman turd.\n\n\u201CIt\u2019\
  s a nail,\u201D Mark explained. \u201CThe Romans were skilled ironworkers. We\u2019\
  ve found quite a few already, so they don\u2019t generally make it to the museum.\u201D\
  \ he added gently. I was momentarily stung with disappointment. However, as I turned\
  \ the rusty lump in my blistered hands, I realised I was almost certainly the first\
  \ person to have done so in the last 1600 years, and felt a sense of connection\
  \ to the distant Roman ancestor who had stood in this mud, under this sky, holding\
  \ the same mundane object. I placed my treasure lovingly in the yellow bucket and\
  \ kept digging."
