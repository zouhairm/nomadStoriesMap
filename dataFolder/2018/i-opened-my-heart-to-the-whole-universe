Text: "It was just over 3 years since the four of us spent a semester in Switzerland.\
  \ Every weekend we found ourselves in a new place. A destination reunion was long\
  \ overdue.\nScott had found round trip tickets to Istanbul for under $400. Our mothers\
  \ were nervous, our fathers were jealous. The farthest east we got while abroad\
  \ was Budapest so this would be a new experience.\nWe tried to comfort them with\
  \ the fact that Scott had visited with his parents a few months ago. Plus he made\
  \ friends with a local.\nFrom Ataturk Airport we took a taxi across the Bosphorus\
  \ to our AirBnB near Taksim. Rounding The Golden Horn we are greeted by the image\
  \ of minarets piercing the skyline at sunset.\nAfter checking in we go to the nearby\
  \ Babel Cafe. We grab some Efes beers and listen to a 3-piece band while Scott makes\
  \ contact with Hakan, the local.\_ He's at Araf. It's not far away and a younger\
  \ crowd.\nThe entrance was a dark stairwell with Araf at the third landing.\_ Coat\
  \ check and bathrooms were on the second and third.\nThe perimeter of the room is\
  \ wrapped with windows, a small stage sits in the corner directly left of us. Scott\
  \ notices Hakan at the end of the bar along the right.\nUpon reaching him he embraces\
  \ Scott and then each of us. Grabbing my beard he proclaims, \"We are Brothers!\"\
  , as he has one of similar length.\nHakan orders us a round of Efes while introducing\
  \ us to a couple of friends. After our beer we hit the chilly February streets of\
  \ the New City. Hakan wants to leads us to BEAT.\nThe queue out front has at least\
  \ 30 people in it. Hakan leads us right up to the bouncers and introduces us as\
  \ friends from America. After a quick pat down we walk right in.\nHakan pushes us\
  \ through the dance floor to the staircase at the back. The first floor is a catwalk\
  \ above the dancers. The second, bathrooms. We reach the top floor which has more\
  \ of a grunge feel compared to the pop aesthetic of the ground floor. The walls\
  \ are black, cigarette smoke hangs at eye level and a very opinionated dj is standing\
  \ on his booth screaming into the mic.\nThe bartenders happily store our coats and\
  \ pour a round of shots that tasted like chocolate milk.\nHakan stayed with us for\
  \ the reminder of the trip. Staying on our couch, he took us to Sultan Ahmet, navigated\
  \ the Grand Bazaar, and even invited us to his house for a traditional Black Sea\
  \ Kitchen dinner cooked by his mom.\nHakan helped to make that trip the best time\
  \ of our lives. Halfway around the world a complete stranger welcomed us as old\
  \ friends."
