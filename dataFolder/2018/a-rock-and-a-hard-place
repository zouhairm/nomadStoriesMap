Text: "The sun emerged from her hiding place in the dark clouds where it had taken\
  \ refuge. The searing heat in the previous day was unbearable, and the sun had rose\
  \ up in the early hours in its majesty.\nThe rays came out and spread like the guitars\
  \ on the plumage of a peacock. Proud and majestic daring all other forces of nature\
  \ with its dazzle. Clara knew such mornings as this always heralded a bright sunny,\
  \ hot day and probably a heavy downfall.\nShe yawned and stretched like a string\
  \ unwinding from a parcel. Then remembering the day's agenda, she jumped out of\
  \ bed and made a dash for the bathroom. As the cold water hit her body, sending\
  \ tremors upon tremors, making fast journeys to and fro her tall frame, she felt\
  \ a bit relax.  Was he cheating, how can he have another family without her knowing?\
  \ She reassured herself she would find out.\n\nDressing up, she heard the birds\
  \ chirruping their endless complaints to whoever cared to listen. Or probably they\
  \ were excited. But she won't share the later sentiment with the birds. She opened\
  \ the door and came out from the house. She winced as the cold wind brushed her\
  \ face. The wind howled on unabated around in the distance. The trees swayed with\
  \ reckless abandon to the music of the wind. \nThrowing her bag on the passenger's\
  \ seat, she started the engine of the car and blared at the horn, startling the\
  \ gate man at the same time as he ran to open the gate for his madam.\nShe had ruled\
  \ out the possibilities of a secret lover. No Mike abhorred frivolous living.  The\
  \ cars kept moving slowly and some passengers  were beginning to get pissed off\
  \ as they could be seen alighting from different cars to trek instead of being trapped\
  \ in the heat of the vehicles. \n\"The more I pry out of him, the more intrigues\
  \ I become\" she said aloud. Finally after a couple of minutes, the road began to\
  \ clear, and she was moving faster. She had a mission. She had to get to the address,\
  \ and get answers to all the numerable questions going on in her mind. \nThe estate\
  \ was serene, fewer cars were on the road. She drove past the house on the address,\
  \ and packed the car. She found the gate and was not surprised to find the gate\
  \ unlatched. This part of the town was always free from any form of attacks or violence.\
  \ She stepped into the garden and winced when she found the graveled path. As she\
  \ opened the front door, she was taken aback.\n\"Surprise!!!\" Everyone chanted.\n\
  \"Welcome to our new home,\" Mike said smiling. \n\"So this is it\"? She thought,\
  \ and smiled."
