Text: "Underfoot, an elfin carpet of moss. Overhead, a titanium sky looms. Ahead -\
  \ the cliff's edge. Wind punctures our faces and hands, the only portion of our\
  \ bodies exposed to the elements. Currently, we're encased like sausage in a dry\
  \ suit. Something akin to a sleeping bag is the insulatory filler. Down below the\
  \ tour guide is drifting between two continental plates in the 35\xB0F crystal clear\
  \ Silfra fissure. He hollers up to us, \"Just jump! Don't overthink.\" Prior, stairs\
  \ were utilized for the descent into the depths for snorkeling. Now the opportunity\
  \ to jump off the edge of a cliff has presented itself. Initially I thought this\
  \ was all in jest - then the guide strolled off the edge. Feeling torn in two directions;\
  \ much like the tectonic plates below, I think of all the decisions I have made\
  \ recently. How I ended up on this cliff edge. Definitely, the decision to down\
  \ that many pints of Polar Beer (oh puns) with the Aussies and the Brit from the\
  \ hostel was perhaps in the light of day - not so wise. The only thing I'm not questioning\
  \ - my decision to quit my job and travel. \n It's 2010. A series of random events\
  \ collide to inspire me to visit Iceland. A volcano eruption chose my destination.\
  \ A quarter life crisis provided the motivation. Eyjafjallaj\xF6kull volcano erupts.\
  \ March through May the eruptions unleash so much ash into the sky it ultimately\
  \ causes the largest air-traffic shut-down since WWII. Working at that time at the\
  \ Northern California Tracon reasonably, everyone mentioned it. Somewhat unreasonably,\
  \ all I questioned - why have I not been to Iceland? Far too many of us have dreams\
  \ of traveling and then you start working and all of the sudden years of your life\
  \ are gone. I had forgotten to pursue my own dreams. The volcano reminded me - I\
  \ put in two weeks notice and bought a ticket to Iceland that September. \n  The\
  \ plan was a few months on the road would lead to a grand epiphany. Just a few months\
  \ would be a sufficient vision quest. A conquest. A mission to find out my life's\
  \ purpose. Oddly enough; I found it - travel. A few planned months, turned into\
  \ a few unplanned years on the road. Eventually, I discovered my calling - tour\
  \ guide. If you've been teetering on the edge, contemplating quitting your job to\
  \ travel no need to wait for a volcano to motivate you. Take the step. Plunge into\
  \ the unknown. Crystal water crashes overhead. Underfoot tectonic plates pull in\
  \ different directions. Ahead - the unknown. Just jump - don't overthink it."
