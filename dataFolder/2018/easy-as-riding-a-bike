Text: "While riding a bike in downtown Vancouver doesn\u2019t seem like a very scary\
  \ or adventurous thing to do, it was for me. When we(the participants of a familiarization\
  \ trip with Tourism Vancouver) were about to embark on an easy-paced bike tour of\
  \ the city, most of us were excited. We\u2019d get to see and learn about Vancouver\
  \ while partaking in a pastime so easy it was a cliche. After we were met with our\
  \ first downhill experience, though, in the middle of traffic no less, some of us\
  \ realized that this trip wasn\u2019t going to just be as easy as riding a bike.\
  \ As I wobbled awkwardly through an intersection, I knew my clumsiness would come\
  \ into effect during the ride and cause at least one spectacle. \n\nI pushed through\
  \ it, though, and did not quit  like a few of my travel agent peers. Though I crashed\
  \ three times(once into a pole, once into a divider, and once into a car that was\
  \ parked in the bike lane), I pedaled on. I hated almost every minute of it. I couldn\u2019\
  t really take in the sights(that of the spectacular views of the waterfront, the\
  \ beautiful trees and surrounding nature just outside of the city, or the impressive\
  \ buildings that you could appreciate even more far away) and correctly steer my\
  \ bicycle. \n\nMy favorite parts of the ride were when we stopped and our guide\
  \ would explain where we were and the history of what we were seeing.  My least\
  \ favorite parts of the ride were when we rode uphill. \u201CIt\u2019s almost over,\u201D\
  \ our guide would reassure us. Then we\u2019d come upon the next literal uphill\
  \ battle. I had to walk alongside my bike during some of the trip. When we were\
  \ on the water\u2019s edge, for instance, as I was absolutely positive I would be\
  \ the first on such a tour to fall in. Also on a particularly steep street on which\
  \ we were to ride downhill. There was no way I could get through that in one piece.\
  \ Still, I never gave up or left the group, no matter how much I wanted to. \n\n\
  While I don\u2019t see myself as an incredibly adventurous person, I\u2019m not\
  \ one to give up easily or to pass up on a new and exciting experience. This bike\
  \ tour is one of those things that I\u2019ll categorize as something I\u2019m glad\
  \ I did but will never do again if the opportunity arises. I hope that the bike\
  \ tour experience is the last I\u2019ll have to add to this category but that I\
  \ never lose that go-getter attitude that leads me to try new things. \n\nThe last\
  \ thing I expected was that the decision to go on an easy-paced bicycle tour would\
  \ be a decision that pushed me to the edge."
