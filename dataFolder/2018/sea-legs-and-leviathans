Text: "The air swirling into the cockpit of the boat was salty and heavier than usual.\
  \ A chilling haze hung over us now, extinguishing any trace of light from the stars.\
  \ My nightwatch partner began to doze off as we slipped steadily and silently through\
  \ the black night of the north Atlantic. \n\nNormally on watch I would not allow\
  \ my partner to doze, in fear that I might do the same, but tonight a particularly\
  \ eerie calm left me uneasy and alert. As I struggled to distinguish the line of\
  \ the horizon in the ink black void before me, I couldn't help but think of all\
  \ the tales of ghost ships and vengeful leviathans that I had been so enamoured\
  \ with as a kid. At this moment I was sure they all must be rooted in cold hard\
  \ facts. Out here things of legend seemed more possible somehow. \n\nBeing new to\
  \ the sailing world I was still learning the rhythm and duties of life at sea. Only\
  \ ten days before I had hardly even set foot on a sailboat, now It was possible\
  \ that I was the only wakeful soul for a thousand miles. I was expecting my ghost\
  \ ship at any moment. Suddenly, something changed that hadn\u2019t changed since\
  \ this journey began. In the cockpit there are two digital gauges; one shows the\
  \ speed of the boat, the other the depth of the water. Since entering the open ocean\
  \ the numerical readout had been replaced by two horizontal dashes as the gauge\
  \ can\u2019t read past two hundred meters. I sat straight up, wide eyed like the\
  \ first time I watched The Shining as I read and re-read the characters now in place\
  \ of the two dashes: 60m. Then 50m, 40m, 35m. Were we about to run aground on an\
  \ uncharted Island? As far as I knew the nearest land was the Azores islands a thousand\
  \ miles east. I scanned frantically for any sign of breaking waves but found only\
  \ the same quiet darkness. I ran below deck to check the radar and found it similarly\
  \ quiet. I shook my watch partner awake. Trying not to panic him in his first waking\
  \ moments, I calmly pointed at the gauge. We sat in silent wait. Only the lulling\
  \ sounds of the water dancing on the hull could be heard as the depth continued\
  \ to fluctuate. Then it dawned on me; it seemed we were not alone out here. Something\
  \ was moving silently below us, something big. \n\nIt was unnerving to think that\
  \ below the surface, in the infinitely black abyss, something felt at home. Whether\
  \ it was a whale or something more mythical I will never know, and perhaps it is\
  \ better this way. It is mystery that lays the foundation for legend, and the sea\
  \ holds a great many."
