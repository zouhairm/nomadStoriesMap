Text: "I left Portland on a mild spring day, with the destination of Las Vegas in\
  \ my sights. The trip down I-5 had grown boring and routine, I decided I\u2019d\
  \ take the old highways and back roads through Oregon. I quickly discovered leaving\
  \ at dusk was a cumbersome decision, my gas tank only held 10 gallons and every\
  \ gas station located on one of those back roads closed at 10:00 pm. My gas tank\
  \ was near empty when I hit the last small town within 50 miles and decided I\u2019\
  d sleep in the parking lot until it opened up. The last thing I expected was for\
  \ an elderly man to walk out at midnight, wearing a WWII veteran hat asking if I\
  \ needed any help. I told him I was waiting for the gas station to open in the morning,\
  \ but he said \u201CF*ck that, get you rig over to the pump and I\u2019ll turn them\
  \ on.\u201D We quickly forget how political the big cities of America have become,\
  \ quietly blaming rural America for all our problems, but the nicest people I ever\
  \ met have been located in small, isolated areas of the US. We all have difference\
  \ of opinions, that we will never solve. It is those moments talking to people who\
  \ really care and want to help you that make us remember how great humanity really\
  \ is.\n I no longer drive down busy highways or interstates when I travel, I love\
  \ meeting those people on the back roads. They live such interesting lives that\
  \ we could never experience being in populated areas of the world. A lot of the\
  \ Earth is still isolated and waiting for you to come visit. The last thing I ever\
  \ expected was a boring, routine trip form Portland, Oregon to Las Vegas, Nevada\
  \ to remind how big the world is. Ever since that trip, I\u2019ve over come my fear\
  \ of flying and barely begun my journey to visit the whole world. I\u2019m ready\
  \ to see more, I owe it all to an elderly man on a blackout back road with the greatest\
  \ hospitality I ever had the experience to encounter. In every foreign country I\
  \ visit, I see that elderly WWII veteran saying \u201Cget over to that pump.\u201D\
  \ \n I know the last thing most travelers would expect on a backroad is someone\
  \ going out of there way to help you, but believe me they will. So take those backroads,\
  \ see the parts of the world that most of people never will and experience the moments\
  \ that give you hope for humanity. There all people all over the world that care\
  \ about you and want to help you on your journey. I hope I\u2019ll see you on that\
  \ backroad one day and I promise you, I\u2019ll stop and share a meal or a beer\
  \ with you. So, share your stories and live your life."
