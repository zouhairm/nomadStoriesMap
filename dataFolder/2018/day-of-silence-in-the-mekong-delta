Text: "There is no more war here, but there is always a struggle to prove to people\
  \ that I am not a rich and arrogant Westerner, I just want to feel and see things\
  \ and I need help! You were right my friends, they don\u2019t really speak English\
  \ here. Those thoughts were in my head as I was trying to explain my situation to\
  \ people in Ben Tre bus station. I sit on a small chair next to the fruit stall.\
  \ I felt tired of Southeast Asian smiles and being a foreigner.\nI was looking in\
  \ my backpack trying to find my phone. I found a calculator-like translation gadget,\
  \ I set it in Vietnamese and I started writing words: river, Mekong, desperate...\
  \ Suddenly a peeled mango appeared in front of my face. A beautiful young girl gave\
  \ it to me. She took her phone and found a translation site and typed in: Do you\
  \ want to see delta? I gave her a big smile and a nod, while chewing mango I got\
  \ from her.\nShe grabbed my hand and started to lead me. \u2018What is your name?\
  \ Where are you taking me? How long is the tour? How much does it cost?\u2019\u2026\
  \ After two minutes, she just turned to me and showed me screen of her phone \u2018\
  No worry. Believe\u2019. This was sweet and tacky at the same time, I decided to\
  \ let her guide me.\nSoon we were on a river shore where we met her friend, she\
  \ gave him a hug and we jumped into his small boat. I sit and repeat my interrogation.\
  \ Now, one of her hand was on my lips and the other was on her ear: shut up, listen,\
  \ enjoy - that was the meaning of this gesture. Her friend just smiled. On our small\
  \ trip we stopped at river market \u2013 colors, shapes and taste of the fruits\
  \ always amaze me. Names are not important. \nOn the way back we were fishing, swimming\
  \ and relaxing in the sun. Nature can be beautifully loud when humans are silent,\
  \ and days can pass so fast when you don\u2019t care about time.\nSoon we were back;\
  \ as I shook hand of her friend, she was running to help a lady pack her stall.\
  \ As I was approaching them I saw that she was talking about our day, but instead\
  \ of words coming from her mouth, her story was told with hand gestures. The lady\
  \ just smiled gently, gave me two plastic bags full of mango, kissed the girl on\
  \ the cheek and showed me her watch, the bus \u2013 meaning \u2018leaving in five\
  \ minutes\u2019. The girl hugged me and told me something with hand movements and\
  \ eyes. I don\u2019t understand Vietnamese sign language, but I felt we somehow\
  \ agreed that we are thankful for a beautiful day we spent together. Next, I was\
  \ in the bus. They smiled and waved to me. I waved back. Happy. Speechless."
