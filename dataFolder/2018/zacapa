Text: "I spent a peculiar period in Haiti, I was there, before and during the earthquake,\
  \ on January 12, 2010.\nThe most interesting part of the day was the evening,spent\
  \ drinking rum, sometimes zacapa, and above all local beer. During the day I worked\
  \ waiting for the sunset, the only lapse of time where I could really talk in French,\
  \ in Spanish and learn a few words of Creole. There I had so much fun with \"Panito\"\
  \ (a nickname of a friend of mine, Josu\xE8), Luca and many other colleagues.\n\
  As  civil engineer, there we thought to make roads, roads that connet two peoples,\
  \ the Haitians with the Dominicans. Road easier to make than to think, for its purpose.\
  \ It was a place full of colors but so full of difficulyt that after the earthquake\
  \ I decided to leave. I was not a volunteer, I worked there for money and for money\
  \ I left, like a mercenary. This has always remained for me as another betrayal\
  \ that I can never erase, or forget. A shock that re-emerges when I listen the sound\
  \ of silent.\n\nBack in Europe, I wandered around doing different jobs. One day,\
  \ while I was walking in Seville during the \"fiera d'Avril\", a famous traditional\
  \ feast, I carelessly trampled, in the crowd, the foot of a small but big guy. \"\
  Lo siento mucho\" I'm going to say, when in front of me I see Vanessa and her husband\
  \ Josu\xE9 Carrera... incredible! I can not believe my eyes. I do not understand\
  \ where I am, I hesitated to understand who they were. I did not believe it. I did\
  \ not understand.\nBeyond the Atlantic Ocean on a typical spring day, in a place\
  \ full of olive trees, far from the sugar canes, I find myself, amazed, in front\
  \ of Josu\xE9 Carrera (the famous \"Panito\") and his wife Vanessa.\nYes, them.\
  \ After 3 kisses on the cheeks, their typical way to greet, and after many good\
  \ speeches we decide to celebrate in a \"tapas\". Almost at the end of the evening,\
  \ another surprise: Vanessa takes from her elegant bag a bottle of Rum, their national\
  \ alcoholic symbol- Rum Zacapas.\nAfter a \"Cruzcampo\" we decide to toast life\
  \ by drinking Guatemalan rum.\nAnd so it is that the deafening silence of my inner\
  \ earthquake, after so many tremors, calms down and the earth seems lighter and\
  \ smells of sugar cane distillate. It seems to me to hear two dancing a bachata,\
  \ air touches ground."
