Text: "About 2 years ago, I did my first solo trip to Chennai. After working on one\
  \ my most challenging assignments, I decided to gift myself a surfing trip to South\
  \ India. Completely oblivious as to what was in stored, I took that leap of faith.\
  \ And boy, was it worth it! \n\nA 5 day solo trip that changed my life, and for\
  \ good! The minute I landed in Chennai, I knew I would be spending the rest of my\
  \ life here. Reached the location- met my surf coach who was extremely kind and\
  \ patient with me. I slowly began to learn the tricks of standing on the board.\
  \ Over the next 5 days , I met a lot of people who I call my friends now. One of\
  \ them asked me if I'm alone or with someone. I said the former and it took him\
  \ by surprise considering how India is when it comes to solo female travellers.\
  \ Even more surprised when I told them that I've fallen In love with the city! \n\
  \nOver the next couple of days, I got to meet a lot of fishermen who've taken surfing\
  \ as a sport, and mind I tell you, they're actually very good at it! My coach specially,\
  \ who's family survived the Tsunami. Told me about his experience, how his father\
  \ and brother were stuck In the middle of the sea when it hit them. \n\nThe village\
  \ of kovalam was hit my Tsunami a couple of year back, but it didn't break down\
  \ their spirits! They built the whole village up from scratch as if nothing has\
  \ happened. \n\nThe people I met make me want to come back to Chennai over and over\
  \ again. Least to say, I found my partner in Chennai! Ah, life. :)"
