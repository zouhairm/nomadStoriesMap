Text: "Large trucks with containers are parked on the roadside. In the early afternoon\
  \ there is almost no shade at all so the drivers protect themselves from the scorching\
  \ sun hiding in the gaps under the trailers. Some lay down on the ground while others\
  \ lean back against the huge tyres of their vehicles. There is nothing else to do.\
  \ They are waiting. They have driven for hundreds of kilometres, starting their\
  \ journeys in the bustling port of Mombasa. Their licence plates show that they\
  \ come from Kenya. They gather here to cross together the border between Uganda\
  \ and DRC, which is merely twenty kilometres away. \nMeanwhile, a small green roadster\
  \ pulls over nearby. The doors open and two people get off the car. One of them\
  \ is a tall Ugandan driver. The passenger is a white tourist girl. A mzungu. Several\
  \ pairs of eyes curiously observe how she walks up to a dirty white monument and\
  \ starts taking pictures. The fact, that for a couple of hours they have been resting\
  \ right on the equator, does not mean a thing to them, while for the girl it is\
  \ a real highlight. One of the drivers gets up and comes to say hi.\nSetting my\
  \ foot on the equator was one of my biggest travel dreams. Isma, my Ugandan guide,\
  \ promised me that on our way to the Queen Elisabeth National Park we will make\
  \ a stop in a place where the two hemispheres meet. This is not a touristy spot,\
  \ as most of the tourists go to the Equator City, seventy kilometres away from Kampala.\
  \ One can even buy an Equator Certificate there. However, where we stopped, there\u2019\
  s just a small concrete sign. No shops, no restaurants, no certificates. Just a\
  \ lot of trucks.\nOne of the drivers approaches us with a smile and greets us in\
  \ Swahili. Judging from his surprised look, I bet he does not expect a white tourist\
  \ to give him an answer in his language. But I have been living in Kenya for almost\
  \ two years and I have learned some Swahili. He laughs, we laugh as well. Juma,\
  \ that is his name, explains that it is the first time they have ever seen a tourist\
  \ stopping by and taking pictures here. I tell him why I find it interesting and\
  \ he points out that he has never considered crossing an equator to be something\
  \ special. He has done it so many times already! I think he finds me peculiar, but\
  \ it doesn\u2019t matter. What matters is that we can have a small friendly chat\
  \ in the middle of the road in Uganda. Funny thing, after two years that have passed,\
  \ I remember that chat better than the moment I took a selfie with the equator sign!"
