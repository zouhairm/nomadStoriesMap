Text: 'This was a story that which i recently went towards western ghats of india
  by bike. There i have seen the culture of people how they traditionally follow till
  now that which i studied in my books and i was surprised by seeing the love of people
  with each other for every tourist and they protect nature planting lakhs of trees
  over surrounding and wild life too its was incredible. lotz of adventures with more
  happiness and treking towards forests with safety and secured the saddest moment  makes
  you thrilling and exciting and happiest moment of your life. The bike life with
  thrilled moment makes me to feel the nature and to love it and the mountain range
  of western ghats and arabian sea joined part was unbelievable. The feeling of travelling
  in bike with friends was filled with fun loaded moments and happiest moment of life
  and the travelling begins in night at dangerous forests with lighting of moonshine
  and the nature of forest with cool breeze. The people which i have seen they are
  literally different from outside of world and they makes love with everyone and
  the food they served for us which i have tasted there was like eating from mother
  hand it was awesome no words to express and i travelled above 3200km from south
  part of india to north part of india and that makes us to connecting with different
  people and the different culture and the traditional of them it was awesome and
  that which we spended time with different people learning the culture of them and
  communicating in different languages knowing the life how they live in the modern
  world and following same traditional as they followed in pasted century ago by this
  i have learned lots of things and culture and loves of people. The technology was
  changed but the love of people they have in heart was won''t change till this world
  ends. I was very happy to share .

  Thank you
