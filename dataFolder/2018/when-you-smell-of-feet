Text: "The last thing I ever expected for my 19th birthday was traveling to Ecuador\
  \ to wash the feet of an old woman, but there I was, elbow deep in a pail of lukewarm\
  \ water that slowly turned to mud. The village had a tropical feel, with it\u2019\
  s thick foliage and muggy air that made my hair stick to my neck and made me wish\
  \ I had my hat. \n\nLocated an hour and a half west of Riobamba, Malpote looked\
  \ like someone haphazardly dropped it on a mountaintop. The trek, nerve-wracking,\
  \ the only path a one-lane dirt road winding between a lush mountain and a dizzying\
  \ drop. Dew coated our lungs as we marched up the road  the village only 10 minutes\
  \ ahead, leaving our driver to fix the bus\u2019s flat tire. Ten minutes turned\
  \ to 20 but Alex Hidalgo, my friend and army leader, refused to let me slow on the\
  \ steep path. \n\n\u201CBreathe like this!\u201D she shouted as she lifted her shoulders\
  \ and inhaled. I mimicked her and pushed on, finally rounding the last corner. I\
  \ saw people gathered at the top, watching us. Women, clad in gowns woven in bright\
  \ threads, their garbs more traditional, a contrast to the kids dressed in jeans\
  \ and t-shirts who ran around their legs. \n\nWe made our way to the center of town,\
  \ a modest collection of buildings surrounding an open field. Large metal pipes\
  \ stacked to one side, which the kids decided to use as a makeshift playground,\
  \ laughing as they clambered over and around them. \n\nOur group clicked into work\
  \ mode, we had half a day to work.\n\nAfter hours of washing feet, the dirt floor\
  \ soaked from water that sloshed about as giggling children pulled their ticklish\
  \ feet away. Shoes almost gone, an old woman, face wrinkled from sunlight whose\
  \ smile crinkled the corners of her eyes which made me think it came quick and often,\
  \ was my last customer. She settled into the chair, shifted her skirt to lift her\
  \ feet into the pail. I scrubbed, my thoughts drifted. \n\nMusic in my head, interrupted\
  \ when the woman asked, \u201CPor favor c\xF3rtame las u\xF1as.\u201D\n\nI simply\
  \ nodded, hoping my face didn\u2019t show how grossed out I was at the thought.\
  \ I hated feet. Still, I pulled her feet onto my lap and couldn\u2019t help but\
  \ smile as she settled in with a sigh and relaxed as though at a luxury spa. I worked\
  \ quickly, but gently, cutting away at the overgrown nails, then donned her feet\
  \ with white and pink sneakers. I finished, she stood, and smiled as she pulled\
  \ me into a hug. \n\n\u201CGracias\u201D she murmured, then turned and left. \n\n\
  Although I smelled like feet, I smiled, it was the best birthday ever."
