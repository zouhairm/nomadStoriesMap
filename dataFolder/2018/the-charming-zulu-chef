Text: "So here I was on my way  to Phinda Private Game Reserve in Hluhluwe wondering\
  \ what was so special about this place touted as a five star game reserve with a\
  \ super local flavor?\n\nUpon arrival, I am greeted by a majestic tower of Giraffes,\
  \ taking in their beauty, it's like a new experience. The local impala called Nyala\
  \ saunter and scamper across also seeking my attention. The coach drives slowly\
  \ so I can take in the beauty and the antics of the welcoming committee before coming\
  \ through to an opening where I jump on to the Game Reserve\u2019s trucks and be\
  \ whisked away to one of the lodges. \n\nDinner is a Boma experience, as I walk\
  \ into this enclosure almost like a kraal, the fire is lit, I am greeted by a local\
  \ dance group of Zulu Maidens \u2013 Izintombi and the young men whom I will call\
  \ Okhabazela. They are dressed in colorful beaded attires and animal skins all locally\
  \ made. They dance and sing with a passion and they pull me in as I become conductor\
  \ for their electrifying current. I join in and dance around the fire forgetting\
  \ my controlled mannerisms. Two left feet who cares? The young men take over the\
  \ dance and display their prowess with pride almost like a courtship dance and I\
  \ realize just how culturally rich this place is. \n \nDinner is also pomp and fare,\
  \ the Chef is a local man who has six wives and is proud of his Zulu heritage. To\
  \ me he presents as a Chief and he wins me over with his charm and how he introduces\
  \ himself. Who am I to judge, I am here to enjoy myself and take in the cultural\
  \ experience. Instantly my mind is opened and my heart receptive to the locals.\
  \ I am hungry for knowledge, good thing I can speak a little the local language,\
  \ they sense it and draw me in, they test me and realize oh am a city girl in need\
  \ of initiation I feel like an alien but also feel at home \u2013 paradox. \n\n\
  With pride the Chef explains his dishes with humor and some history behind them.\
  \ The food is decidedly traditional with a modern twist. I can feel the pride in\
  \ the locals and genuine appreciation of allowing them to educate me on their culture.\
  \   The Chef continues to tell us that he never went to school but he is head Chef,\
  \ I marvel at this and realize that life is what you make it and happiness is a\
  \ choice. I lose all judgement as I enjoy the food and chatter, and am sad to see\
  \ the night come to an end. I realize that I enjoyed myself, I learnt new things,\
  \ and undoubtedly I made a local connection that is forever etched in my heart.\
  \ Phinda is truly five star."
