Text: "I\u2019m fairly certain Francesca is trying to tell me about diarrhea. Our\
  \ language barrier is the problem, the duck we both ate earlier in the day at lunch\
  \ the impetus for the diarrhea she is trying to confess. Or the diarrhea she is\
  \ trying to accuse me of having\u2014I\u2019m just not sure. But now, a full twelve\
  \ hours later, sometime near two a.m., we\u2019re on the prowl for food again, having\
  \ fled a friend\u2019s afterparty due to rumors of kebab, only to fail\u2014the\
  \ snow-kissed streets of Turin, Italy, empty of vendors\u2014with us carrying that\
  \ defeat back to the sixth-floor flat and Francesca holding her stomach, saying\
  \ something about the duck, and making a joke that\u2019s not landing. She pulls\
  \ me aside, now isolated from the pack, looking for the right word. Diarrhea, I\
  \ want to say to her. You\u2019re trying to say diarrhea.\n\nWe\u2019d only met\
  \ earlier that day at a restaurant that harbored no qualms of putting strangers\
  \ together at the same table. Francesca took notice of the drawing on my placemat\u2014\
  a human heart with a leafless winter tree growing up and through\u2014and asked\
  \ for the crayon, then sketching an outline of Italy. Sardinia, she tells me, this\
  \ is where I\u2019m from. And I\u2019m charmed. So I invited her to our show that\
  \ night, and she agreed, with us then finishing our gnocchi with duck\u2014oily\
  \ and unctuous.\n\nSo now, show concluded, alone in the stairwell after leaving\
  \ the afterparty, Francesca has since abandoned the recesses of her memory and is\
  \ using Google to translate, her and I mere inches from touching: I can no longer\
  \ tell when it\u2019s an appropriate time to kiss a girl. So, I just watch the phone\
  \ load, concerned for the outcome: diarrhea, I\u2019m sure of it. But her face enlightens,\
  \ and she's solved the conundrum. Digestion! she exclaims to me. Digesting that\
  \ duck is making it hard to get up all these stairs!\n\nAnd she\u2019s laughing,\
  \ moving closer. But we\u2019ve linger too long. And I\u2019m certain, now, that\
  \ this is not the right time to kiss a girl, having navigated that thin space of\
  \ a missed connection, one assumed word having filled the void.\n\nWe head back\
  \ into the flat, into the throng of drunk Italians. We dissipate to the crowd and\
  \ all night long, I catch Francesca still staring at me, smiling, making me mistranslate\
  \ my own confused instincts: this feels like love, yet that\u2019s not the word\
  \ for it. So I smile back, knowing our moment of possibility has passed, like two\
  \ hungry strangers drawn to a placemat heart; like snow, outside the landscape window,\
  \ still falling on the empty streets of Italy."
