Text: "We navigated the streets of Turpan, inhaling the smells of naan baking in tandoor\
  \ ovens and occasionally shielding our eyes from wind-blown sand. My partner and\
  \ I hoped to rent a motorbike for the day to explore outskirts of the former Silk\
  \ Road trade stop. Our efforts felt more futile as every shop owner turned us away.\n\
  \nJust as we were about to resign, we heard a call from behind us. It was a young\
  \ man with dark features, about the same age as me at twenty-three, a cigarette\
  \ tucked between his fingers. \n\n\"I think I can help you,\" he spoke in slightly\
  \ accented but clear English. \"Where are you from?\"\n\nAs we told him our respective\
  \ countries, the U.S. and Australia, he shared with us that his name was Akil and\
  \ he was an Uyghur born and raised in Turpan. It was rare to hear English spoken\
  \ in the deserts of Xinjiang Province. When we complimented him on his speaking\
  \ skills, he replied with a small but humble smile that he had been teaching himself\
  \ the language over the past year. \n\nHe offered us a deal to let us use his own\
  \ motorbike for the day on the condition that we meet him for a beer once we return.\
  \ Struck by his kindness, we offered payment or at the very least collateral, but\
  \ he refused adamantly. \n\nWe rode past traditional grape farms to the remains\
  \ of ancient cities. Advanced irrigation systems and Buddhist temples held together\
  \ by dried mud still stood centuries later in the Gobi Desert. A rich history preserved\
  \ in sand.\n\nWe returned with his bike just as the sun was going down and met for\
  \ a cold Tsingtao. He asked us about our travels with genuine interest, but when\
  \ we inquired about his, his expression shifted from warm to despondent. He looked\
  \ both ways and leaned in towards us.\n\n In a hushed tone he whispered, \"They\
  \ took my passport.\"\n\nEvery doorway in Turpan is framed by a metal detector.\
  \ A military presence makes itself very known in Xinjiang. The government has put\
  \ the province on lockdown following multiple terrorist attacks in the 21st century.\
  \ \n\nAkil cannot name his future child certain names related to Islam, the religion\
  \ he practices. His passport, along with the passports of all Uyghurs in the province,\
  \ has been seized. He sees the world through his education and the people he meets.\
  \ \n\n\u201CI\u2019ll see you in the U.S. one day,\u201D he said with the same humble\
  \ smile as we parted ways. I couldn\u2019t help but think of the power of my passport,\
  \ the flimsy book in my back pocket. A power I once took for granted that I couldn't\
  \ take for granted anymore."
