Text: "I like to think we all have \u201Ctraveling personalities\u201D, and \u201C\
  everyday personalities\u201D. And while my everyday personality is quite relaxed,\
  \ my traveling personality is neurotic, anxious, and worst-case-scenario-prone.\
  \ \n\nIt wasn\u2019t always like this. My first few solo trips were experiences\
  \ of pure joy and freedom. Getting lost, experiencing sensory overloads from eating\
  \ everything and planning nothing, and always stumbling upon helpful strangers.\n\
  \nBut at some point, semi-adulthood crept in and I began to worry: What if I miss\
  \ my flight? What if I lose my wallet or get \u201Ctaken\u201D or worse still, WHAT\
  \ IF I DON\u2019T ENJOY IT? Managing my own expectations had become my principal\
  \ challenge. \n\nIt was in this frame of mind that I visited Ponto du Ouro, Mozambique\
  \ in December \u2013 hoping for the best but expecting the worst. \n\nI was taking\
  \ a boat trip optimistically advertised as a \u201Cdolphin encounter\u201D. The\
  \ sea was choppy and the skies were grey, and my excitement was dwindling at the\
  \ thought of diving into the cold, murky water. Despite being a certified scuba\
  \ diver I suddenly found myself doubting if I could breathe through a snorkel. \
  \ \n\nI could already taste the disappointment of not seeing a dolphin at all, or\
  \ confusing my own flippers for a sea creature\u2019s and then missing the actual\
  \ excitement.\n\nWhile I was still fumbling with my camera, everyone on the vessel\
  \ jumped into the water. Judging by their excitement the dolphins were close. I\
  \ tumbled in and found my diving mask completely fogged, with no time to adjust.\
  \ I could hear their beautiful shrieking sounds, but apart from sticking out my\
  \ hands in the hope of touching one (which was strictly prohibited), I had no way\
  \ of knowing where. \n\nI went up for air, adjusted my mask for sight and dived\
  \ down again. I felt lost and hopeless just as someone brush me on the arm. When\
  \ I turned around, they were all there: ten or fifteen stunning dolphins, gliding\
  \ and frolicking within five meters of me. I dissolved into the moment and must\
  \ have held my breath for minutes on end because when I finally surfaced, everyone\
  \ was busy climbing back onto the boat. \n\nI wanted to thank whoever had nudged\
  \ me, because without their help I would surely have missed it all. Everyone claimed\
  \ that they had been far away from me, however, leaving me to draw the only conclusion\
  \ possible for someone desperate to tell a good story: the dolphins must have summoned\
  \ me themselves."
