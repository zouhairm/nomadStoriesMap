Text: "I don\u2019t normally pick up the phone if the number calling is unrecognisable\
  \ or unknown, but something in my gut told me to live a little. \u201CHello, is\
  \ this Alan Wilson speaking?\u201D, a passive voice asked on the other end of the\
  \ line. Though frazzled at first, I almost immediately recognized that it was Luthando,\
  \ my childhood friend! \n\u201CWhat a surprise!,\u201D I exclaimed. \u201CIt has\
  \ been way too long, my friend.\u201D \nHe called to invite me over for lunch as\
  \ he was back in the City visiting his parents from the States. \nAfter the phone\
  \ call I instructed her to prepare our children, Matthew and James for the next\
  \ day. Waking up the next morning, I was more excited than usual, leaving my family\
  \ utterly bewildered. \nWe were driving toward a destination none of them knew about.It\
  \ was a hot summers day in Gugulethu: a dusty township situated in Cape Town with\
  \ a population of just over 100 000 people. \u201CDad, where are we?\u201D asked\
  \ Matthew while we were stuck in traffic, waiting for somewhat 30 cows to cross\
  \ the main road.\nAs soon as we arrived to our destination, I could see Luthando\
  \ walking hastily toward us in the car wanting to welcome us in. \n\u201CLinda,\
  \ Matthew, James - meet Luthando, my best friend and man who saved my life when\
  \ we were kids.\u201D Linda looked more shocked than ever, but pretended that she\
  \ knew what I was talking about when I said Luthando had saved my life. \nThe aroma\
  \ of fried chicken, \u2018pap\u2019 and other delicious delicacies filled the air\
  \ as we stepped into the living room. The smell was very unfamiliar to the kids\
  \ but it brought back countless childhood memories for me. \u201CSit down, dig in,\u201D\
  \ Luthando said. His mother responding almost immediately: \u201CUsile wena! Where\
  \ are your manners? Allow me to say a prayer.\u201D \nLinda eventually started opening\
  \ up. She and Mama Susan (Luthando\u2019s mom) got along quite well after a while.\
  \ It was then time for the men to hit the porch (something our fathers used to do).\
  \ \nLetting out a long sigh of despair while looking down at his feet, Luthando\
  \ said something that nearly made my head zing. \u201CI\u2019m dying. My heart is\
  \ failing me,\u201D he said.\u201CWHAT!\u201D \u201CSurely a transplant will do!\u201D\
  \ \u201CNo, I have given up hope.\u201D\nThe lump in my throat eventually gave in\
  \ and I started to cry. \nA few hours later, we went home and Linda noticed that\
  \ I wasn't the same as when we arrived.Days later, Luthando received news that there\
  \ was a willing donor. The person wanted to remain anonymous. That donor was me."
