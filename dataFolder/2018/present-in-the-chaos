Text: "I\u2019m scatterbrained, exhausted, and anxious after 38 hours of travel. My\
  \ body is caked in sweat and dirt; surrounded by clouds of mosquitoes materializing\
  \ out of the thick, humid air. A sense of calmness seems impossible to obtain until\
  \ I\u2019m able to rest my head on a pillow rather than a headrest.\n\nShe, however,\
  \ is sunkissed, relaxed, and blissful. Welcoming. \n\nStanding beside her clothing\
  \ rack, she reaches for my hand and introduces herself. \u201CTalia\u201D she says\
  \ calmly, as she breaks out a soft grin, deepening the wrinkles in her cheeks. I\
  \ set my 40lb pack down on the narrow, oil-stained alleyway, and we sit on a bench\
  \ just outside of the chaotic streets of Bangkok, Thailand.\n\nMy appreciation for\
  \ being in this beautiful country, this incredible culture, is lacking. Talia can\
  \ tell. She can see that I\u2019m distraught and eager to get to my hostel - my\
  \ home for the next few weeks.\n\nIn high-pitched, accented english, she whispers,\
  \ \u201Cin, 1-2-3; out 1-2-3. We breathe.\u201D\n\nTalia closes her eyes and takes\
  \ a deep inhale; I follow.\n\nMinute one: Meditating in Bangkok? Loud, hectic, Bangkok?\
  \ How?\n\nMinute two: Just focus on your breathing. Count it; that will help. In,\
  \ one; out, one. In, two; out, two. Perfect.\n\nI\u2019m shadowing her posture;\
  \ our hands placed lightly on our thighs, shoulders rolled back and proper. Our\
  \ heads are slightly back; chests rising and falling with each and every breath.\n\
  \nMinute three: I think I\u2019ve lost track of counting. How long has my mind been\
  \ blank?\n\nI subconsciously enter a completely detached yet enlightened and peaceful\
  \ state. I hear nothing but the sound of my breath as it amplifies. \n\nOur souls\
  \ are intertwining. I am desireless, yet drawn to be monumentally present. Talia\u2019\
  s breath is powerful, yet soft and controlled. I can feel that her tranquil state\
  \ is growing further alongside mine. \n\nTwenty minutes of stillness pass before\
  \ breaking in her untroubled voice. \u201CYou are special,\u201D she says. \u201C\
  You practice this; you are at peace.\u201D\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until that moment,\
  \ when our meditation was over, that I realized I was in Thailand. I made it. I\
  \ was no longer stressed; no longer manic. I was grateful, aware, and excited. Talia\
  \ thanked me, though all of the thanks were hers to take, reminding me that being\
  \ present is a gift; being here, experiencing new cultures, is a gift. \n\nI grabbed\
  \ my pack and walked away, taking in the transcendental importance of each person\u2019\
  s soul, and the influence it can have on my own; a lesson I will cherish forever\
  \ thanks to my newest friend, Talia."
