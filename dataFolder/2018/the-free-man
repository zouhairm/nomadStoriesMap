Text: "I walked across Spain in 43 days as a pilgrim on the Camino de Santiago.\n\n\
  Was there ever a happier time? For 43 days, my feet alone carried me 900 kilometers.\
  \ I never felt so powerful. I never wanted to leave. \n\nThen I met a man who hadn't.\
  \ \n\nSo it's early on, in Estella. I turn onto a cobblestone street with looming\
  \ walls. A tall guy with bleached hair and tan skin is playing a wooden flute for\
  \ my friends, who are smoking and ignoring him. He's not bad.\n\n\u201CWhat\u2019\
  s your name?\u201D I ask, joining them. \n\nHe turns: his eyes are blue and the\
  \ light in them is funny. \n\n\u201CFrei.\u201D\n\n\u201CFree. What day did you\
  \ start?\u201D\n\n\u201C15 years ago.\u201D \n\nHe plays more.\n\nMy friends say\
  \ he's taking a bus to the next town, but when I wake to walk west before the sun's\
  \ in the east, Frei is still there. I wave to him, and he screeches. I won't see\
  \ him again.\n\nBut Frei is in Rioja where the vineyards glow. He's on the lonely\
  \ Meseta where the sunflowers stand dead and the sky is a cold blue dome. He's in\
  \ the plazas bugging pilgrims, wiggling the skin of his throat, screeching as they\
  \ dine. He asks for beer. The hospitaleros turn him away and the baristas roll their\
  \ eyes. \n\nHe is an annoying institution, but he's not scary. When I see him, we\
  \ bump fists. Sometimes, his blue eyes flash and we smile. One night, I play an\
  \ old piano and he sings.\n\nHe's in Leon in the empty chair at my dinner table,\
  \ bumming a smoke from my crew.\n\n\u201CWhy are you walking?\u201D I ask. Frei\
  \ leans back and says:\n\n\u201CI lost my wife and I lost my children.\u201D\n\n\
  \u201CI'm sorry. How?\u201D\n\nHe gazes at me for a long moment. His head rotates\
  \ on the axis of his gaze, which deepens in intimacy until he grabs his throat.\n\
  \n\u201CAw, come on Frei\u2014\u201D\n\n\u201CALALALA!\u201D \n\nThat\u2019s just\
  \ how he is, they say. He's walked the path of transformation so long, he's gone\
  \ static. Pilgrims pass him on their way to Santiago, hellbent on returning new\
  \ people. They need peace, clarity, closure, health. Frei just drinks and paces,\
  \ 500 miles each way. \n\nWeeks pass. I reach Santiago, heart aching with triumph\
  \ and dismay that I must leave soon. I want to do it all again. Pain, loneliness,\
  \ danger: give it all to me again. \n\nIt's golden hour in the great plaza before\
  \ the cathedral. If there was someone to throw a tantrum to, I would. I don't want\
  \ to leave. \n\nThen I see Frei leaning against that impossible backpack of his.\
  \ How many times has he come to this end? He's not drinking or making noise. He's\
  \ just looking at the cathedral, all covered in tarps and scaffolding: a work in\
  \ progress."
