Text: I was born in the middle East , spent my childhood living in different countries.
  my favourite part about moving around was who I was going to meet at the new country?
  What were they kids like ? What was the food like ? What music was like ? What could
  the kids teach me ? And what language am I going to learn. I eventually settled
  in North America at the age of 12 and did not travel till I was 19. I randomly flew
  across the world to Tanzania to make a local connection. I spent 5 months volunteering
  there, I made friends, I made coworkers , I had a favourite store to buy groceries
  and food from. it was all about the connections I made. I learned the language I
  lived within them I made long life friends. Since then I had travelled to Kenya
  , Uganda, Thailand, Cambodia , Vietnam, laos, Lebnon , Jordan , isreal, turkey,
  Cyprus , the Dominican, and Mexico. I don't plan to stop anytime , but every trip
  I still think what are the people like , what does the language speak, what is the
  food like, how do they dance , what does the music sound like. I use an online application
  to meet locals and get to learn their ways , whether it's making rice in Laos, or
  rolling cigars in the Dominican. I use homestays and air bnbs to get those local
  connections and to live like a local within them. I used it in the middle East and
  recieved a crash course from every host on every country and I would not replace
  those experiences with anything else. I hope one day I can go to South america and
  do the same, make more local connections.
