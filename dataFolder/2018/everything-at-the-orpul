Text: "My right hand clenches the goat\u2019s throat and my left holds its mouth closed.\
  \ I see a bead of sunlight reflected in the animal\u2019s eye and look away, focusing\
  \ on the area just above my right hand. It is this area where I watch the pulse\
  \ subside\u2014first faster than the ticking second hand on my watch and then fading.\
  \ \n\nI\u2019d spent the past seven weeks in Dar es Salaam, figuring out bus routes\
  \ and how to cross the street without getting hit. I am originally from a large\
  \ city and felt comfortable in this bustling metropolis, but now I was transitioning\
  \ to over a month living and learning with the Maasai of Northern Tanzania.\n\n\
  Unlike my city routine, here I rise and set with the sun. At 6am I go for a walk\
  \ with Patrick, my translator and guide, and an elder. In the morning chill Mt.\
  \ Meru towers on our right and the sun peaks over Kilimanjaro in the distance. \n\
  \nWe collect branches from the o-remit tree as the elder shares that today we will\
  \ participate in an abbreviated orpul. \u201COrpul,\u201D he explains, \u201Cis\
  \ a sacred place where warriors go to rebuild their strength, elders go for meetings,\
  \ and others go when they\u2019re sick.\u201D \n\nPatrick looks at me. \u201CHe\
  \ wants to know if you\u2019ll participate in everything.\u201D I don\u2019t quite\
  \ understand what he meant by everything, but I nod yes. \n\nLater in the afternoon,\
  \ activity in the boma escalates and I am instructed to find a pot. An old woman\
  \ wrapped in a blue and red Maasai blanket hands me one and points. I follow her\
  \ finger to a clearing beyond the boma and find a group of morani\u2014warriors\u2014\
  holding a goat beneath a tree. Male elders sit a short distance away. \n\nEven as\
  \ I watch a man start a fire, it still had not dawned on me what exactly this orpul\
  \ involves. Then a warrior wrestles the goat onto the o-remit branches and kneels\
  \ on its stomach and two others grab its front and hind legs. Patrick motions me\
  \ towards the animal\u2019s head. Everything.\n\nI have always eaten meat, but I\
  \ have never seen an animal die. Something about that feels wrong, just as something\
  \ about the way the morani skin and dissect the goat feels right. They set aside\
  \ the skin to dry out, the legs are hung over the fire, and pieces of bone and meat\
  \ are thrown in the pot to make a medicinal soup. \n\nTwo warriors remove the goat\u2019\
  s kidney and, to my surprise, take a bite. They offer it to me. I lock eyes with\
  \ Patrick. Everything. I bite and taste iron. Another cups his hands, filling them\
  \ with the goat\u2019s blood and motions towards my mouth. Patrick smiles. Maybe\
  \ not everything."
