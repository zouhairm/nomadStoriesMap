Text: "I jostle my way through the mass of bodies and into the doorway, seeking refuge\
  \ from the driving rain which comes in great tumultuous waves as the clouds heave\
  \ high above. \n\nI'm greeted by a wall of cigarette smoke that sets my eyes to\
  \ watering. Soft blue light penetrates the haze and illuminates a long bar along\
  \ one wall. There is a stage in the far corner, and on the dance floor people lounge\
  \ casually in front of a projector screen. They imbue Bintang's and cigarettes like\
  \ bizarre offerings to the moving pictures. A short film, played on repeat with\
  \ no sound. \n\nFor someone who generally takes up a lot of space at 180-something\
  \ centimetres tall, I feel miniscule. Nobody has noticed me yet, I could sneak out\
  \ the door again and face the rain instead. But I didn't come to Bali to run away\
  \ from new things, so I let the crowd push me further in, the smoke enveloping me\
  \ in its acrid embrace. \n\nI buy a beer and stand awkwardly in the corner. I don't\
  \ know the people I've come with that well, and conversation is almost impossible,\
  \ so I alternate between sipping my drink and checking my phone for a good 20 minutes,\
  \ my battery and bottle are both quickly drained. \n\nThe screen is packed up and\
  \ the locales occupying the floor now stand. The venue suddenly seems twice as full\
  \ and three times as loud. \n\nThe band starts, and I politely groan. I hate heavy\
  \ metal. But this is something more. I definitely would not call myself a muso,\
  \ but I can see the crowd seethe with the melodies. With sound that emits raw emotion\
  \ and soul, so powerful you can almost see it, taste it, touch it. \n\nOne of my\
  \ friends, an 18-year-old girl who I've known for 3 days suddenly appears above\
  \ the crowd. She's crowd surfing, and the look on her face is of pure ecstasy. \
  \ \n\nIf this were Australia, I wouldn't dream of joining the mosh. I've heard too\
  \ many stories of piercings torn from faces, of crumpled and broken bodies trampled\
  \ underfoot, of concussions from stray elbows and fists thrown in the heat of the\
  \ moment. \n\nBut I see no aggression in this crowd. They jostle and shove, but\
  \ they smile and laugh too. Before I can stop my feet, they've carried me into the\
  \ crowd. I'm quickly swept up, pushed, shoved, thrown about and generally treated\
  \ like a rag doll. I don't remember the last time I had so much fun at a concert.\
  \ \n\nBali. The land of middle-aged tourists, of wave chasing yogi types, of Bintangs,\
  \ coconuts, and sunsets. This was the last place on Earth I expected to fall in\
  \ love with Punk."
