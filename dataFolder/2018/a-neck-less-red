Text: "Trappers, cowboys, settlers, and pioneers: A quick summary of my family history.\
  \ As a born and raised Albertan, you can with all rights call me a redneck; at age\
  \ 35 I had never stepped foot on foreign soil. \n\nFour years ago I bought my now\
  \ ex-wife a DSLR camera for her upcoming trip to Australia. While her trip went\
  \ ahead, our relationship and the camera did not. The camera sat unopened in storage\
  \ until one day, I decided to take the camera with me into the mountains. For the\
  \ next few years that camera didn\u2019t leave my side, I climbed higher mountains\
  \ and wandered deeper into forests. Magazines started asking for my pictures and\
  \ a relationship ensued when one day, an editor asked me  \"We know this is short\
  \ notice, but would you be able to cover a press trip in Spain and write a 3-page\
  \ spread on it?\u201D\n\nThis was so far out of my comfort zone, but twenty hours\
  \ later I stepped foot onto foreign soil for the first time. Seeing my name on a\
  \ sign being held up as I stepped off the plane me feel uneasy. \u201CHere I go\u2026\
  \u201D\n\n\"Welcome to Galicia! I am Iria, your guide, are you hungry?\"\n\nShe\
  \ spoke English and offered food! Automatically making her my best friend. Iria\
  \ took the liberty of ordering a traditional Galician lunch. Now up to this point\
  \ in my life, my diet has mostly been a hearty one of meat and potatoes; what sat\
  \ in front of me they call pulpo and I did not need a translator to realize on my\
  \ plate was octopus. I grab a toothpick and tell myself, \u201Cchew, chew, swallow\
  \ THEN breathe.\u201D  As my eyes lifted from the table, Iria was waiting for my\
  \ reaction with a smirk as we both laugh, it was soft as butter, rich, salty and\
  \ delicious!\n\nThe next few days were a whirlwind of sights, cuisine, culture,\
  \ and history.  As we came around the Cathedral de Santiago to visit our final stop\
  \ at a museum, we found the courtyard filled with an orchestra; I opted out of the\
  \ last destination to take this in, sitting on the steps on an 11th-century Cathedral\
  \ filled with history that pre-dates the discovery of Canada, among thousands of\
  \ people from all corners of the globe. It was a surreal moment that I soaked in\
  \ and will stay with me for life. \n\nWhat I saw abroad was so foreign to me. I\
  \ saw happiness where money was vacant, a lack of social class, and the acceptance\
  \ of all races, beliefs, and tolerance. \n\nWho would have expected a camera to\
  \ change a man's life, take him around the world, open his eyes, heal, inspire others,\
  \ and wash the red off his neck. But the last thing I expected was me gusta el pulpo!"
