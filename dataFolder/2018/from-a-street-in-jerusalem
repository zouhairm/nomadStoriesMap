Text: "\u201CBe careful, I\u2019m scared of what could happen to you over there\u201D\
  , said my mother on the telephone before I was due to flight to Israel. I cannot\
  \ lie, I felt the same fear when I booked my fly. But that day, my friend pushed\
  \ me to buy the tickets. So I did. \n\nBefore taking off from Portugal, a friend\
  \ whom I was going to meet there called : \u201Chave you heard the news? Israel\
  \ is maybe starting a war against some of its neighboring countries!\u201D. The\
  \ day after I read that Benjamin Netanyahu, country\u2019s prime minister was accused\
  \ of corruption and the police asked to send him to jail.\n\nI could have decided\
  \ not to go. To skip the flight and stay at home. But I chose to go through with\
  \ it, and I believe I\u2019ve made the right choice.\n\nBecause I\u2019ve got to\
  \ experience the magnificence of the Dead Sea, that made my friends and I the only\
  \ living creatures bathing in it (well, except for the bacteria inside the water),\
  \ floating between Israel and Jordan, and its desert lands. The contrast between\
  \ the lands and the sea, seen from Masada Fortress, shows you how nature is such\
  \ a good artist. \n\nI can now better talk about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\
  \ Because I saw, felt, asked people from both sides what was the deal. \n\u201C\
  On one hand, I see French, American people, people from all around the world. Everyday.\
  \ On the other hand, I haven\u2019t seen my uncle in more than twenty years now.\
  \ He lives on the other side of this wall.\u201D, said Heyam\n\u201CI did my two\
  \ mandatory years of military service, but I just signed for two more years in the\
  \ Israelis National Defense! Why? Because this is our country, and we will fight\
  \ for it. We will protect our lands and our people from all the terror that could\
  \ happen to us\u201D, said Micha.\n\nPick your side of the wall : you probably have\
  \ the privilege to do so. \n\nAll my pre-conceived beliefs about the country were\
  \ erased, and replaced by fresh memories and feelings. \n\nMy former insecurities\
  \ were built by people who have no idea what Israel looks like.\n\nAll I experienced\
  \ could not be translated in television. As I was living it, I was becoming my own\
  \ witness. \n\nThe last thing I expected was to be confronted to a reality different\
  \ from what I had seen and heard for so long. What I choose now is to live in my\
  \ own reality, the best way that I can. To be curious, speak to people, learn in\
  \ any new situation. \nFrom Jerusalem, to Paris, via my little neighborhood in Porto."
