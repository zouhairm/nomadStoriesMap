Text: "I am not a big believer, but this story will prove that I do have Guardian\
  \ Angels, and I met them in India.\n After an almost sleepless night in a hotel\
  \ with no air-conditioning, and only a wet towel to cool me down, I manage to gather\
  \ my backpack, catch a rickshaw and reach the train station. I am in Varanasi, and\
  \ I hope to catch a train to Gorakhpur Jn., the next leg to my final destination,\
  \ Nepal. As I enter the station and see a throng of people, my heart sinks a bit.\
  \ The place is jam-packed. The train will arrive soon, and I am still without a\
  \ ticket. I see a sign \u201CWomen only,\u201D and I join the shortest line to get\
  \ one. I'm happy to be a woman. I pay 75 rupees for a general compartment ticket\
  \ without a guaranteed seat. A billion souls were there that day, and even if the\
  \ train arrives empty, I can't imagine how we are all going to fit. My ticket is\
  \ melting in my sweaty palm as I wait. The train arrives already full. Everyone,\
  \ including me, jumps to its opened doors, but i stand no chance in this elbow fight.\
  \ Suddenly, I notice a police officer coming my way. He has a long, almost white\
  \ mustache that curls a bit at the ends. He speaks a language I neither know nor\
  \ understand, but he helps me board the train. I literally squeeze myself in and\
  \ even get a seat. I'm in awe and relieved. I sit still, and I begin the 6 hour\
  \ journey through a hot and colorful India. As the songs on my playlist soothe me,\
  \ and as the heat feels as hot as 40 degrees centigrade should be, I dose off, and\
  \ the countless pairs of curious eyes disappear for a few moments. \n When i wake\
  \ up, I see a man sitting across from me with his legs crossed and a broken arm\
  \ in a plaster cast resting on a sling. He's wearing the orange robes of a buddhist\
  \ monk. I meet his eyes as he is staring at me, and I look away. He doesn't feel\
  \ saintlike. Gorakhpur Jn. is the last stop and it's only about 100 km away from\
  \ my dream land \u2013 Nepal. I am almost there! The monk starts talking to me,\
  \ but I don't have any desire to chat, and when he asks me where I am going, I just\
  \ say Nepal. To my delight, he is also going there. Suddenly, my curiosity is on\
  \ fire. I wonder how he will get there. He doesn't say, but he points his finger\
  \ to the floor and keeps nodding his head. I am either very lucky, or he is fooling\
  \ me. I roll the dice, and I stay on the train with the monk. I reach Nepal and\
  \ thank my two Guardian Angels, the police officer and the monk, for helping me\
  \ on my travels."
