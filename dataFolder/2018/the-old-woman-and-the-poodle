Text: "April in Paris! \n\nHaving spent mornings exploring and afternoons picnicking\
  \ on baguette, cheese and wine, I reserved my Paris nights for dinners with my sweetie,\
  \ hoping each evening we'd find that peculiarly Parisian restaurant where we could\
  \ share an unhurried meal not surrounded by a bevy of American tourists, Lonely\
  \ Planets in hand. With my weak French, I asked the bartender his recommendation.\n\
  \nExcusez moi. O\xF9 est un bon restaurant local? \n\nThe bartender explained, and\
  \ while I listened, many of the words flew past my ears.  I watched his gestures\
  \ as he pointed his hands towards our expected culinary destination. \n\nI think\
  \ I got this.\n\nThirty minutes later, as we watched the neighborhood with its trendy\
  \ shops and restaurants turn residential, I knew that we wouldn't find Chez Whatever.\
  \ Darkness had fallen, and we were hungry. Frustrated, we turned back towards the\
  \ hotel. Within a few minutes, we saw an ancient poodle on a bejeweled leash, being\
  \ led by an equally ancient and elegantly coiffed woman, barely five feet tall.\
  \  \n\nSometimes I think it's more of a female thing, but I ask directions.  Even\
  \ when I barely speak the language, I ask.  \n\nExcusez moi! Y at il un bon restaurant\
  \ pr\xE8s d'ici?\n\nOui! She gestured for us to follow.\n\nWe politely followed\
  \ her towards this mysterious venue - was she taking us to her home?  We approached\
  \ what looked like an old storefront - no business sign - with darkened curtains\
  \ masking its contents. The door was heavy; as we pulled it open the sound inside\
  \ became amplified. Before us was a candlelit dining room, heavy with French chatter\
  \ and the thick smell of broiled steaks and roasting stews. Our newfound guide pointed\
  \ to the room's corner, towards a beefy man working a palate of thick cuts of meat\
  \ on a beautiful stone hearth.  \n\n\"Mon fils,\" she beamed. Her son.\n\nWe were\
  \ escorted to one of the small rustic wood tables, nestled near the warm burning\
  \ of the hearth. The wine was poured. Our aged friend smiled at us, indicated that\
  \ her son would select our meals, and retired to her own small table, in a clear\
  \ sight line of her son the chef, of whom she was so obviously and immensely proud.\
  \  \n\nOur dinner that night was simple yet superb; a reminder that the French are\
  \ famous for their cuisine for good reason. Hours later, as we readied ourselves\
  \ for the walk back to our hotel, we thanked the chef profusely, and asked that\
  \ he express our gratitude to his mother, who had since dozed off in her chair,\
  \ poodle resting in her lap."
