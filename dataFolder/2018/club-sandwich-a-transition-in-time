Text: "It was 8:52 am, Bandra- CSMT. She steps in with a large blue plastic bag unfurling\
  \ draped murky green cloth; pulls the hanger up hooking it on the handle bar in\
  \ between the passage. Unwrapping commodities from hair-pins, soft tissue paper,\
  \ naphthalene ball, scissor, earring, nail polish, puzzle cube, napkins, and ear-bud.\
  \ Name it up and that should spill out from this uniquely crafted bag-cum-hanger\
  \ to which all these things hung. Stuffs with local brand also duplicates sold in\
  \ the local train of this city, called Mumbai. \n\nOf the five major suburban railway\
  \ lines, I was commuting on the Harbour line that connects western to central part\
  \ earlier known as Victoria Terminus changed to present name Chattrapati Shivaji\
  \ Terminus. These are the life lines to this place, they say. As I am waiting to\
  \ board the train. I see people climbing down the over bridge not to miss one. Slowly,\
  \ I am surrounded by bevy of people. With the train approaching to platform, many\
  \ took a leap in to the running train swiftly at the very flow of train. They were\
  \ too quick to climb in their respective coaches.\n\nFraction of it comes to halt\
  \ in front of me. I am taken inside by the entire crowd beside me. Barging in, pushed\
  \ in by bags and elbow. Here I was distorted, to fit myself in crunch space, stomach\
  \ pulled in, my neck seem to have pop-out longer few inches wanting to breathe and\
  \ hands are nowhere but approaching haywire to just get a hold on rather balance.\
  \ Forcing and crashing made my way to grab a seat. Overjoyed to have found one,\
  \ I find placed on someone\u2019s lap it was a tight fight to have lost for the\
  \ matter of seconds. It was unsettling to not find a place to stand. I was offered\
  \ a place to sit after the train had passed five stations. Numbness let loose and\
  \ slowly my body parts - shoulder, thighs and calf muscles released grip to have\
  \ come to senses. Balance is the key to shuttle in local trains, I was told by an\
  \ old lady sitting in front of me. \n\nA ruffle turned calm as train approached\
  \ the destination. Entering a conclave of colonial heightened structure of vast\
  \ heavy iron shed with now restored stained glass on windows to the stone fa\xE7\
  ade. The food stalls and coffee vending machines at the platform has modern amenities.\
  \ As if a club sandwich with bread of that era were stuffed with local ingredients.\
  \ A vanishing silhouette of the girl wrapping things pushing it to plastic bag departs\
  \ the train. This bogie (II class Ladies) as walk through to the lay person\u2019\
  s life."
