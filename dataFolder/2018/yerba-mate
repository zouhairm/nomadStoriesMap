Text: "Colored fluffy balls are attached to the rear-view mirror. I see the reflection\
  \ of the driver's face, he touches the colored altar, then he kisses his hand and\
  \ prayers come out of his mouth making vows for the trip. \n\nAn old lady with big\
  \ feet and removed slippers is about to prepare a drink made out of dried leaves\
  \ of yerba mate. Once the ritual is finished, she passes the hollow calabash gourd\
  \ to the person sitting next to her. The drink passes from hand to hand, cementing\
  \ unexpected relationships. \"Mate?\" The person sitting beside me asks. \"Obrigada\"\
  , I say, taking the gourd with the full hand.\nNight falls, I'm half-awake, and\
  \ images of this solitary journey in South America flutter into my mind. During\
  \ the 20 hours of journey, no one gets on or off the bus. Large spaces and people\
  \ hardly ever.  \n\nI perceive, while I am half-sleep, that the bus slows down again;\
  \ and suddenly it abruptly stops. \"Policia!\" I hear. I open my eyes: the driver\
  \ is standing up and is confabulating with the policemen. \"Federal or municipal\
  \ police?\" I hear someone asking. The big-footed lady gets up suddenly: \"Who among\
  \ you are not carrying \"mercadoria\"? (merchandise), she says. I, uncertain about\
  \ the meaning of the term, raise my hand. Then I turn back and realize that I am\
  \ the only one in the bus who did this. The lady asks me if I can take one of her\
  \ begs and declare that it\u2019s mine. I nod, regretting the gesture a second later.\
  \ Three policemen with their uniform get on the bus, pointing their torches at our\
  \ faces. I can not see their visage. They tell us to go down, to get in line, to\
  \ open our suitcases and to put our hands behind our back. \n\nThe lady discreetly\
  \ points me her huge bag. She looks at me into the eyes in order to remind me about\
  \ our deal. I have no idea what there is inside the suitcase, but it comes into\
  \ my mind that the road between Paraguay and Brazil is a famous smuggling route.\
  \ Of what kind of goods? Explosives? Weapons? Drugs? I get in line, on the side\
  \ of the road. Passenger\u2019s suitcases and packages with their mysterious content,\
  \ at least to me, are seized. Waiting for my turn, I open the zip of the woman\u2019\
  s suitcase, but it's dark and I can\u2019t see what's inside. Now it\u2019s my turn.\
  \ \"O que tem a\xED?\" (What's inside?). Without waiting for the answer, the policeman\
  \ opens the bag, he points the flashlight inside and says \"I have to seize this\
  \ load of yerba mate and do not tell me that it was to be consumed by your whole\
  \ family\"."
