Text: "I smelt the rain before I noticed the clouds, I could hear my heart thumping\
  \ before the thunder reigned. And yet, had I felt the change in the air, thick like\
  \ a knife through butter, perhaps I wouldn\u2019t have found myself stranded on\
  \ the esplanade, alone. \n\nThe storm had crept up on me, much like the rum last-night,\
  \ but I should have known better. Everyone here knows that in the middle of the\
  \ afternoon, in this city of Havana, was when the wind and the rain danced.\n\n\
  Finding myself an hours walk from where I was staying, I decided to make a run for\
  \ it, scurrying through the streets, making a beeline for the Hotel Nacional de\
  \ Cuba. Passing a pot-hole the size of a cadillac, and dodging a few roaming taxis,\
  \ I eventually made my way onto the grounds of the hotel. A grande building showcasing\
  \ dry towels for anyone dripping like a tourist. \n\nAfter drying myself in the\
  \ foyer, I slipped into a quiet room to slumber out the afternoon. The room itself\
  \ was stark, aesthetics which resembled more of a communist airport than a hotel\
  \ swaying with grandeur. My eyes rested in the corner of the room to where a young\
  \ lady sat. I watched as she scrolled through her phone, eating time by feasting\
  \ on social media. I sat beside her. She glanced at me. Her eyes big and welcoming,\
  \ like Cuban hearts. Her smile tight-lipped, cautious, like Cuban psyches. \n\n\
  I introduced myself to the young lady, and she herself as Erika. Erika told me that\
  \ she used the room for the Wi-Fi. Most Cubans couldn\u2019t afford the internet\
  \ at home. \n\nWe would talk long into the night, Erika sharing tales of her city,\
  \ assuring me of a tour and an umbrella once I was back from my trip to Trinidad,\
  \ a place where she had never been. A stone\u2019s throw away for a tourist, a lifetime\
  \ away for a local. She promised to call me whilst I was there. I didn\u2019t have\
  \ a mobile phone, so instead, I would call her.\n\nTwo days later I found myself\
  \ in Trinidad, a town besieged by every colour of the rainbow. It was sometime during\
  \ lunch, as I was chewing on some infamous Cuban bread, when the house phone rang\
  \ in the Casa I was staying at. Momentarily, memories struck me of my youth. It\
  \ had been a long time since I\u2019d heard a landline ring. Maria, the home owner,\
  \ answered the phone. After a brief conversation in Spanish, Maria turned to me,\
  \ \u201CIt\u2019s for you,\u201D a quizzical endorsement as she handed me the phone.\
  \ \n\n\u201CHey it\u2019s Erika, how\u2019s Trinidad?\u201D \nHer voice hung but\
  \ for a fleeting moment, and left my words lost. Cheeks red, Maria listened in."
