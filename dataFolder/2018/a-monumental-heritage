Text: "\u201CDjemila\u201D, the name sounds strange to foreigners and to some Algerians\
  \ as well. It is the Arabic word that describes all beautiful things. I was on a\
  \ journey to discover the beauty of my country. On that journey I decided to visit\
  \ the village of roman ruins. The last thing I expected was to fall in love with,\
  \ the north eastern Algerian heritage, Djemila.\n            At the entrance of\
  \ the village, they ask you where you came from. Later I found out that they keep\
  \ count of every tourist that visits and his country background. I had to walk through\
  \ a path of trees to reach Cuicul. I don\u2019t think I have ever breathed purer\
  \ air. Seeing and touching hundreds of ruins gave me goose-bumps. They represented\
  \ a whole different civilization. \n           The Arch of Caracalla stands strongly\
  \ as if it was built yesterday. It pushes you to wonder how they managed to build\
  \ high concrete walls with far less supplies than we have today. Standing in the\
  \ middle of the temple would give you a sense of peace and psychological comfort\
  \ no matter what religion you belong to. The theatre is so big that the government\
  \ uses it for summer concerts and music festival. The Roman architect is mesmerizing\
  \ and it would captivate the attention of every visitor immediately. I almost had\
  \ wished I studied Latin to be able to read monumental writings. The tourist guide\
  \ had informed me that Cuicul was founded in the 1st century A.D by Roman soldiers\
  \ that came from Italy. Unfortunately, it was abandoned at the end of the 5th century\
  \ which resulted in the village getting dominated by Muslims. I saw several houses\
  \ when I was standing by the temple, and I could not be more envious. It must be\
  \ wonderful to live next to a historical place. The sensual and peaceful vibes that\
  \ surround the place captivated me in a strange way. I had made up my mind about\
  \ visiting it a second time. \n            For the time being, only few people know\
  \ about Djemila in the world. But I do hope that its beauty is seen by every traveler\
  \ that seeks to discover   new places. Algeria is a big country and it is full of\
  \ interesting sites. Timgad, for example, is another monumental heritage city that\
  \ I intend to visit.  And so my journey continues."
