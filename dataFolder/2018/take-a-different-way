Text: "Look they are woman veterinarian! A man face difficulty to control an animal\
  \ whereas how can they?\n\nI had to wait almost two hours to meet some student of\
  \ a veterinary college.Between a real busy class schedule they gave me just one\
  \ hour. But they are not boys they are girls.Anyone can think so where is the point\
  \ that they are not boys they are girls.But when this story belongs to an area of\
  \ Bangladesh then its make sense.\n\nBangladeshi people still think that veterinary\
  \ profession belongs to man.There is nothing for woman,Popy said to me.Popy is one\
  \ of the few girls student in this college.Mostly her batch is first batch of this\
  \ college.\n\nSo how challenging to choose a different path? Fiza told me that we\
  \ actually don\u2019t get proper support from our family.Our parents still think\
  \ that we can\u2019t make this as a regular profession.\n\nPopy also told me that\
  \ they had a program for increase health awareness of animals in rural area.when\
  \ they went a village for this program they heard some people mockery to them say\
  \ hay look they are woman veterinarian! A man face difficulty to control an animal\
  \ whereas how can they.But when we showed that what we can do they started to admiration.We\
  \ saw pleasure in there faces when coming back.\n\n\u201CHow was the feeling when\
  \ you admitted this college?\"\n\u201CLittle bit nervous but really happy-Popy told\
  \ me.\u201D\n \u201CWhat about carrier plan?\u201D\n \u201Cobviously a veterinarian\
  \ answer with a smile. That's why we choose to be here-Fiza and Dina told me too\u201D\
  \n\nSuddenly Popy looked her watch and say oh our next class is about to start.I\
  \ also looked at my watch and told her it was a real short one hour.But I will bear\
  \ in my mind for long time.\n\nTime to say goodbye,its been a pleasure to meet with\
  \ some step forwarding girls.Those who  took a different path.\nWhen I was leaving\
  \ the college I felt that time is changing in Bangladesh, not too fast but not too\
  \ slow either."
