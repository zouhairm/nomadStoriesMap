Text: "Preparing my suitcase from Greece to Spain a few months ago, I could not predict\
  \ anything that would follow the next months. Destination, a small winery in the\
  \ heart of Rivera del Duero, in Tubilla del Lago. The city of Aranda de Duero was\
  \ my base for the next six months, 18 kilometers from Tubilla. My goal was the contact\
  \ with the world of wine. During my six-month stay, I met people from another culture\
  \ with different customs. I didn't spoke Spanish but now Yo hablo poco espa\xF1\
  ol. I tasted unique and different local and traditional food plates like paella\
  \ and lechazo. I traveled to historical cities like Toledo and Burgos, academic\
  \ cities like Salamanca, but also modern ones like Madrid and Vitoria-Gasteiz. I\
  \ was aroused in the Spanish mountains of Castilla y Leon, but also I walked along\
  \ to a famous beach of Valencia which I found a big graffiti in Greek language.\
  \ I worked from the sunrise until the sunset in the vineyards, I also worked the\
  \ harvest period to the winery to produce the new wine of 2017, beside of remarkable\
  \ people of Marta y Mate winery. \nThusants of hectares of old and new vineyards,\
  \ red grapes, 270 wineries and finally a wonderful red dry wine from the famous\
  \ variety of Tempranillo or Tinto Fino. Two hours north of Madrid, after the mountains,\
  \ alltitude of the area from 750 until 1150 meters, i found a protected name wine\
  \ area, the Rivera del Duero. Duero is the river which start and cross the area\
  \ and going until to Porto and Atlantic ocean. Aranda de Duero is the center and\
  \ the biggest city of the area. In Rivera del Duero I discover and I taste wines\
  \ from some of the most famous wineries not only of Spain, but of all over the world,\
  \ like Vega Sicilia, AALTO and Pago de Carraovejas. I learn that the secret of the\
  \ good wine hide in the love, the passion and artistry of the people of the area.\
  \ These characteristics passing from one generation to the other. These people dug\
  \ hundreds of years ago, kilometer of underground tunnels to melt and keep their\
  \ wines at controlled temperatures. Now, every September at there celebrations (fiestas),\
  \ they open these tunnels for all the people to go down, to drink wine and to dance\
  \ with traditional local bands all the night. \nFinally, when I preparing my suitcase\
  \ for the way back, i was thinking that the last thing that i didn't expected, when\
  \ I started my journey,  to make so good friends and to discover how is possible\
  \ one cup to have so big concentrate dose of magic, the cup of Tempranillo wine."
