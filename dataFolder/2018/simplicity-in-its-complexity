Text: 'I didn''t know what the expect of this city.People were going in all different
  directions,seemingly no rules on road and beeping of the horns were everywhere.Once
  I looked out of the window of my comfy hotel,the air filled with gentle sweetness
  hit my face and the smells of various foods are enticing me to run down and try
  them all.


  Once I stepped outside,I was right in the middle of those busy streets .Apart from
  using map,I opened my soul and all I wanted to do was to get a little lost.I saw
  a small shop,full with a lot of little plastic chairs,in a alleyway opposite to
  my hotel.There I joined in with locals and enjoyed their local way of life with
  famous PHO soup and EGG coffee.(Not a perfect match though,it was so yummy haha..)


  According to a tip from the seller of that shop,I continued my way to the heart
  of this city,the Old Quarter.I was still amazed by its crazy rush hour traffic and
  crowded streets and vendors at each street sell the similar product resulted in
  its name."What is the real life behind the busyness of this city?"my thoughts were
  scattering.When I was wondering about it,I found a railway which runs along the
  North to the West of old quarter.For no particular reason I decided to take a long
  walk along train tracks.


  When I walked by their kitchen with ''WOW''eyes starring at them,a woman,washing
  dishes in a bucket on the footpath looked quite uncomfortable to me.Later she asked
  for privacy seeing camera in my hand.She introduced herself and smiled."This is
  just a life here.Densely populated city spares no crevasse.We simply make most of
  what we got.But cooking,washing,cleaning and resting or enjoying the family gathering
  with beloved ones are like anywhere else in the world.Mostly people don''t have
  much here but we don''t really mind it as much!"And I did a peek through open windows
  and saw how her family lives.No furniture,small crowded space but with smiling faces.


  I smiled,pretending like I understood her local pronunciation of English and continued
  my way."Don''t walked on train tracks.Trains are running all the time and it''s
  slightly narrow for you and train!!"she shouted.And I said "That''s why I''ve worn
  running shoes for this hike haha".We both laughed out loud and what I realized was
  that we don''t need much to be happy.Surrounded by a lovely family and having a
  roof over our head is all that we need,regardless of the train tracks next to our
  windows.Now I found the real simplicity beyond the complexity of this amazing city.'
