Text: "Today started in Saigon City. We were woven through the very heart and bustle\
  \ of the districts, en route to the Mekong Delta. A cultural and historical ride\
  \ for the senses that engaged head, heart and hand. The busy, yet organised congestion\
  \ of the roads, to the historical mecca of the Cu Chi Tunnels, to the waters and\
  \ internal village life along the Mekong River, mixed with a tasting plate of local\
  \ and traditional foods. The deep and contrasting colours of the landscape playing\
  \ a balancing act with the eyes. I have been grateful for the time given from the\
  \ connections made. Where a friendly smile has needed no translation.\n\nThe highlight\
  \ was a forged connection with our hotel tuk tuk driver. He was most hospitable.\
  \ The sharing of cultures, family, food and simple time listening. The city has\
  \ presented much. The hustle and bustle of a city striving to move forward, while\
  \ still holding on to and sharing a history most dear. I have loved and savoured\
  \ many moments spent just watching. From interactions of drivers, children's smiles\
  \ as I pass by, to stalls and colours in the street, to the aromas and organised\
  \ congestion of the many markets. Today the confronting and deeply historical and\
  \ emotional visit to The Killing Fields was \u2018sombre\u2019 to say the least.\
  \ Again connection to a people not mine to a conflict not mine. Many silent tears\
  \ shed. The place itself screamed volumes in the quiet where silence reigned over\
  \ the sea of visitors circling reflections amidst the lotus flowers. Then, that\
  \ one tree. My chance to remember in karakia for those lost. The journey home weaving\
  \ us again through the streets and communities of stark contrast. Today we found\
  \ connections in silence and quiet reflection. Thank you Phnom Penh for your strength,\
  \ grace and respect.\n\nThe red dirt roads of Bakong Village provided the setting\
  \ for our bicycle tour, meeting many kids along the way with mutual smiles and bright\
  \ eyes. The markets again an attack on the senses with the vibrant colours of foods\
  \ reflecting a day\u2019s work. The next part of our day took us to Kampong Khlaeng\
  \ Fishing Village. The boat ride wove us through lotus laden waterways, guiding\
  \ through to have lunch with a local village family.\n\nI have been privileged to\
  \ connect with the innermost sanctum of raw village life. I connected much to the\
  \ spiritual depth, and the history of a land steeped in pain, but also respect for\
  \ the people - who despite the past and for most, their current disparities, manage\
  \ to put on a smile."
