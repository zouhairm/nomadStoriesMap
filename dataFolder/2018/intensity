Text: "Hitchhiking. It\u2019s a great way to travel. The best? The various meetings\
  \ along the way. Whoever it is you encounter, they are people with a destination.\
  \ With a story. People you meet for a few hours in your life at the most. But it\u2019\
  s enough to build a connection.\n\nHitchhiking with a caravan however, like we have\
  \ been doing these weeks, is like hitchhiking to the square. All advantages of \u2018\
  normal hitchhiking\u2019 are enlarged. The stories, the people, the encounters,\
  \ but also the adventure: everything feels more intense. Just like the disadvantages:\
  \ whatever anyone says, mobile you are not, with your trailer. But at least you\
  \ always have a place to sleep.\n\nAnother thing we notice, is that the strangeness\
  \ of the situation makes also connections more intense. The people who decide to\
  \ take us connect to the idea behind our journey, and its main message: You need\
  \ others to keep you going. Our drivers stay connected with us. And the other way\
  \ around. Even though we\u2019ve only met them just for several minutes, or hours,\
  \ in our lives.\n\nTake Jelena and her brother, Strahinja. For two hours we have\
  \ sat in a car with them, on our way to Sofia. Deep conversations we do not have.\
  \ We feel a language barrier. Also, we are worn out a two days\xB4 standstill in\
  \ eastern Serbia. Yet we feel very satisfied in their car, looking out of the windows,\
  \ watching the mountain scenery pass by. Without any problems or suspicion, we cross\
  \ another border.  \n\nOnce we\u2019ve been hooked off in front of Bulgaria\xB4\
  s National Stadium in its capital city Sofia, it occurs to us how special this drive\
  \ was again, and how beautiful are these people. Warm-heartedness is in the air.\
  \ Intensity. Especially when my friend Tjerk starts to play a song on his guitar\
  \ \u2013 and dedicates it to our new friends. \u2018Great voice, I\xB4m impressed\u2019\
  , Strahinja reacts, wiping a tear from his eye. A new experience has been added\
  \ to both our lives.\nHow bewildered we are then when Jelena sends us the following\
  \ e-mail only one month later:\n\n\xB4Hello my dear friends,\nI am so sad and have\
  \ to tell you... my brother had a car accident 20 days ago and he passed away...\
  \ I am mute about that....\nThanks for the pics and extremely good time that we\
  \ shared all together.\n\nYou are very very welcome to come to visit me in Belgrade.\
  \ I will be so glad to host you. This is a sincere invitation. We'll be in touch\
  \ folks!\n\nYour friend,\nJelena\xB4\n \nStupefied.\nBewildered.\n\nHow intense\
  \ an encounter along the way can be.\nHow intense a life.\nAnd sometimes how short\u2026"
