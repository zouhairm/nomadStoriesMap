Text: "The three-hour bus journey from Hanoi, Vietnam, to Halong City was one that\
  \ had incited reflection, excitement and desire; a desire to explore the new realm\
  \ into which I ventured and escape the trundling metal wagon that, without suspension,\
  \ had become the sworn mortal enemy of my bottom. Not soon enough, the marvellously\
  \ bland high-rise of our nightly refuge came into sight. As my fellow backpackers\
  \ set about reclaiming some of their eight-hours sleep from the unforgiving travel\
  \ toll, my mind was saturated with one unquenchable hunger; adventure.\nAs an avid\
  \ climber, my attention was drawn to the rolling green mountains of Halong City.\
  \ My only compass was a crudely drawn map, my only direction was that of my mind.\
  \ There exists a wonderful freedom, rarely encaptured within European society, where\
  \ you can explore under no constraints whatever you desire to explore. Riding the\
  \ high of this liberation, I began to search for a track that could take me higher;\
  \ one of your classical winding, dirt-covered paths, trees standing to attention\
  \ either side like a guard of honour offering protection against the furious Sun\
  \ radiating over Halong. Throwing between myself a small brick that I\u2019d found\
  \ abandoned further down the track, I continued jubilantly, engrossed in the rockery\
  \ along my travels. \nIt wasn\u2019t long until I stumbled upon a small community\
  \ of shanty housing, when I saw a little boy silhouetted against the doorframe of\
  \ one of the shacks. He spoke something in Vietnamese. \nI didn\u2019t have to speak\
  \ Vietnamese to have understood the meaning of his words. Two ferocious dogs immediately\
  \ bounded towards me. Terrified, and with them closing the distance, my first instinct\
  \ was to find higher ground. One of the hounds had taken another track, which I\
  \ hadn\u2019t noticed before, looping around to the back of me. Surrounded, I clambered\
  \ up onto a rock out of reach, the brick I\u2019d been playing with before suddenly\
  \ posing itself as a tool to my escape. Forcing myself to be calm, conscious that\
  \ dogs have a very developed perception of human emotion, I waved the brick before\
  \ them. Side-by-side, snapping and snarling, baring their feral fangs, they presented\
  \ a small window of escape back down the dirt track.\nI moved cautiously, lowering\
  \ myself down at once so that I had balance before they could act upon my dangling\
  \ legs. Once connected with the ground, maintaining eye contact with both dogs,\
  \ I slowly backed away back down the track, until they did not follow me any further."
