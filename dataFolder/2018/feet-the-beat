Text: "It is March, and the sun has sprinkled Edinburgh with warmth, but the days\
  \ are still short. You happen along a pub where raucous cheers can already be heard,\
  \ despite the sun barely dipping below the horizon. They offer ceilidh dancing,\
  \ and given that your only other option is attempting to scrape up a crowd at your\
  \ hostel, you pay your dues and step inside. \n\nThey say the best way to explore\
  \ is by foot, and your feet are tapping their way down a column of those who fill\
  \ this city. You have walked around hills and through supermarkets and down muddy\
  \ laneways and now you are twirling with strangers. You lose your footing, but you\
  \ are lifted up by the fiddle and the encompassing cheers of the small crowd on\
  \ stage.\n\nWhile the band disappears by the bar, you trade glances with a dark-haired\
  \ American girl, and that is all it takes to make a friend. You are spinning her\
  \ around, dipping to the music crackling over the speakers and falling over each\
  \ other with laughter. \nAn Australian boy asks for the next dance and you oblige,\
  \ but lose him to the crowd, only for him to reappear at the end of the night, offering\
  \ to show you and the American girl to another bar, where you discover your hidden\
  \ talent for snooker, much to his dismay. The American girl \u2013 you discover\
  \ her name is Sallie \u2013 flirts with the bartender and promises to drink you\
  \ under the table, and fixes your makeup in the bathroom. You fall in love with\
  \ her the same way you fall in love with every girl when you drink. You know that\
  \ you will probably never see her again, but that\u2019s the way you chose to live,\
  \ a transient state, drifting through hostels and continents. Pretty boys and prettier\
  \ girls have crossed your path, and held you in linked elbows as you feel your way\
  \ around a city, dipping in and out of bars and cafes and museums.\n\nYour feet\
  \ beat another pattern, one of grief, when you drag yourself out of bed and to the\
  \ airport the next day. You\u2019ve bounced with no rhythm to songs you remember\
  \ from movies, to ones you\u2019ve never heard before. Last night, you danced through\
  \ history, to songs passed down through sons and daughters. Long before they were\
  \ petty criminals sailing to Australia on rickety boats, your family lived in this\
  \ country. Did they dance like this in halls and courtyards, for richer and for\
  \ poorer? They might\u2019ve drunk like you, with friends and strangers and under\
  \ tables. Maybe they travelled like you, falling in love with everything and everyone.\
  \ You hope they can see you."
