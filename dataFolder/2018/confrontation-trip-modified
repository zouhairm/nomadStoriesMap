Text: "Travelling in order to confront your feelings to somebody is conceptually disastrous.\
  \ There is a huge risk of failure and literally no sense in believing in miracles,\
  \ when you are aware of the compulsiveness of your decision. This is also the case\
  \ when you don\u2019t plan your trip at all. Wheel of fortune. But risks, one way\
  \ or another, turn out to prove you right. \n\nLast year, I had booked three days\
  \ in Bologna. It would be my first trip abroad without any kind of company, just\
  \ by myself, and in order to search for someone that might or might not be there.\
  \ I can barely say \u201Cciao\u201D in Italian, but, when I landed, I found it fascinating\
  \ to just close my eyes and go for it. From the very beginning, I got \u201Clost\u201D\
  \ in a faraway, exotic vortex- although Italy isn\u2019t considered such an isolated\
  \ destination- called \u201Coutside the comfort zone\u201D. \n\nThe first day, I\
  \ got lost in the fields. After I left my luggage, I found it feasible to walk a\
  \ 20 km distance from my hotel to the city centre (typical mistake when you depend\
  \ on chance), but I realized my tremendous mistake soon enough to have already lost\
  \ telephone coverage. I thought that probably no other tourist might have made their\
  \ way through the Bolognese meadows, just to sit on a bench and read Sade\u2019\
  s \u201Cphilosophy in the boudoir\u201D. A feeling of uniqueness embraced me: \u201C\
  stranger found in the wild\u201D.  \n\nThe second day, I got lost in the city\u2019\
  s harlem. Italian cities are constructed in multiple, circular layers. Each and\
  \ every one of them has a different essence. Despite the centre\u2019s northern\
  \ glory, with cathedrals, museums, secluded squares and beautiful arches, there\
  \ are places near the train stations that seem like an Arab cosmopolis, full of\
  \ street markets and carpet stands, spice pyramids and incense smells.   \n\nThe\
  \ third day I finally met with the one I was looking for. But, liberated as I was,\
  \ I almost couldn\u2019t pay attention to the encounter. We had coffee and went\
  \ to see a brilliant Hopper exhibition the city\u2019s Palazzo Fava was hosting.\
  \ Then we enjoyed the typical afternoon \u201Capperitivo\u201D, in a withdrawn bicycle\
  \ store called Velostazione Dynamo, where I got to feel like a proper Bolognese.\
  \ But that just made me realize: exploring a spot all alone had been an even better\
  \ way to reconnect with my emotional and intimate state and to respect my own desires\
  \ than I could ever imagine. I closed my eyes\u2026 You might not get exactly what\
  \ you had in mind, but that is exactly the point. \n\nAs I reopened them, suddenly,\
  \ [\u2026]"
