Text: "In the airport of Kingsford Smith Michael have been standing, holding a poster\
  \ \"Welcome Down Under!\". I stepped on Sydney's land where I had four days of travelling.\
  \ The first place I visited was the University of Sydney which reminded me of Hogwarts:\
  \ ancient buildings with massive arches and colorful stained-glass windows. I wish\
  \ I had a butterbeer here. In a couple of hours, we hopped off the Circular Quay\
  \ where the dazzling picture of the Sydney Opera opened to me. I could not stop\
  \ blinking, as I was dreaming of this moment all the past months in my homeland,\
  \ Russia. Russian images surrounded me here too, in the bathroom of the Sydney Opera,\
  \ I could not understand how to tap water, till one of the women said to me in Russian:\
  \ \"Here!\". Later in the evening, Michael's brothers prepared for me a special\
  \ Russian dance \"kozachok\", with the typical for it whoops \"Hop\" and \"Hey\"\
  . They even called me Vlad, a politically humorous reminder of home. \n\nThe next\
  \ day we went to The Blue Mountains, about two-hours' drive from the city. We stopped\
  \ in a small city Katoomba, named after an aboriginal tribe. It is famous for the\
  \ mount peaks of The Three Sisters and the legend behind it, which was surprisingly\
  \ similar to our legend of the Angara river and the Lake Baikal in the heart of\
  \ Siberia. Father Baikal threw a rock after his daughter, Angara, who was escaping\
  \ with her beloved Yenisei, another Siberian river. That's how a famous sight Shaman-Stone\
  \ emerged. According to the aboriginal legend, Three Sisters were turned into the\
  \ rocks not let them escape to the men of another tribe. We were walking down the\
  \ tracks of the Wentworth Falls, wrinkling eucalyptus leaves, where I faced the\
  \ strongest fear of my life. This was a poisonous red-bellied black snake, typical\
  \ for the New South Wales surroundings. The snake was getting a sunbath right on\
  \ the track as if was saying to me: \"Don't be afraid, I am a wild nature of Australia,\
  \ you will love me\". \n\nNew South Wales and Sydney are famous for its beaches.\
  \ To be fair, I never saw an ocean before, and my first greeting happened at night\
  \ on a Bondi beach in Sydney. While Michael was drawing my name on the Bondi's sand,\
  \ I soaked my feet in the warmest foam of the Pacific Ocean. Later we went to Avoca\
  \ Beach, where Michael took a boogie board, made of a foam plastic for the very\
  \ beginners. That day I was saddling the waves of the ocean together with grannies\
  \ and kids next to me. I could only think \"I am home, I am home\"."
