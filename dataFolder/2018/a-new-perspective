Text: "I stood on a white pebble beach staring at a pink, blue, and purple sky as\
  \ the sun set over the Mediterranean Sea. Every detail of the scene put me at a\
  \ loss for words: the pastel colors reflecting on the water, the soft contrast with\
  \ the white of the waterfront restaurant behind me, the relaxed lapping of waves,\
  \ and the shared sense of peace between strangers watching the same sky. I\u2019\
  d seen beautiful sunsets before, but this was different. It wasn\u2019t just about\
  \ the natural beauty. I was looking at this sunset through eyes that saw a new vision\
  \ for a life in which this level of pure joy wasn\u2019t so unfamiliar. \n\nI found\
  \ myself in the Spanish coastal town of J\xE1vea for a retreat organized by Las\
  \ Morenas de Espa\xF1a, a community for Black women expats living in Spain, though\
  \ I signed up mainly because I wanted a vacation.\n\nOn my first day in Spain, I\
  \ arrived at the Mediterranean-style villa with a red tiled roof and bright yellow\
  \ stucco exterior. Passing the orange trees as the taxi drove through the entrance\
  \ gate, I was greeted by women who welcomed me by name like we were old friends.\
  \ Over five days, our group of 13 women participated in visioning sessions, a Spanish\
  \ cooking class, wine tasting, and more. Those experiences were memorable, but it\
  \ was the profound effect of hearing the women\u2019s stories that caught me by\
  \ surprise.\n\nDuring a Q&A session with women who moved to Spain, a woman named\
  \ Erin spoke about her decision with a happiness in her voice that almost moved\
  \ her to tears.\n\nErin shared with us, \u201CI\u2019m at a place where the goals\
  \ I\u2019ve set have either happened already or will happen within the next year.\
  \ It\u2019s crazy to realize that I\u2019m living out the vision I had for my life\
  \ and that goes to show the power of not being afraid to go for your goals, that\
  \ they\u2019re not out of reach.\u201D\n\nHer words and the words of the other women\
  \ echoed in my head while I watched the sunset. I had lived my life based on what\
  \ is supposed to be the responsible, safe path. You go to college, get a job, and\
  \ keep moving up to better jobs. That path hadn\u2019t worked for me since I graduated\
  \ from college in the midst of a recession, but I kept pushing anyway, losing any\
  \ sense of direction along the way. \n\nOn that beach, I realized it\u2019s time\
  \ to regain some control. Working for myself and having the freedom to move around\
  \ the world isn\u2019t easy, but it is possible - just as possible as arriving in\
  \ a new country and leaving with a sisterhood of women whose journeys are now intertwined\
  \ with mine."
