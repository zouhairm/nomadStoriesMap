Text: "It was around 7 pm when I reached Trivandrum railway station, a city full of\
  \ lights and complete strangers, and also my first time travelling alone. Trivandrum\
  \ is the capital city of Kerala and the place where richest temple in the world\
  \ is located. Even though I was so thrilled to travel alone, I heard that it's not\
  \ safe for a girl to be alone at night. And to make my fears true, the local men\
  \ were looking at me in a strange manner when I walked out of the railway station\
  \ to get a taxi. I had already reserved a room online for my stay there, so I was\
  \ relieved. As it was a busy night, taxis were not available and my GPS was not\
  \ functioning properly. So I hailed a rickshaw and gave him the address of the hotel.\n\
  The rickshaw driver started talking to me asking my whereabouts and was being friendly\
  \ but I was hesistant to answer him because of all the doubts whirling in my mind.\
  \ I think he understood my fear and asked me whether I am new to the city. I replied\
  \ him yes and he gave me a smile. What he told me next struck a chord inside of\
  \ me. He said, \"all men are not the same as you think. I can understand your fears\
  \ because I have a family which includes a daughter of almost your age. I will drop\
  \ you at a hotel which is safe for you\". I felt so happy and relieved to hear those\
  \ words from a man at that time. I felt easy to talk to him after that. He told\
  \ me about the hotel I booked online, which doesn't have good facilities, the distance\
  \ is so long from the railway station and also the rate is higher for a traveller\
  \ like me. So he took me to a hotel which is cheaper for me but I didn't felt right\
  \ about the surroundings of the hotel and I told him the same. Without hesitation,\
  \ he took me to another hotel where we found out that rooms were not available.\
  \ Then we reached a tourist home with a cheaper rate and I felt safe there. I really\
  \ liked the room so I reserved it. The rickshaw driver waited patiently for his\
  \ fare although it was a busy day. So I gave him what he deserves for helping me\
  \ at night to find a safe place to stay. He became so happy which made me smile\
  \ with contentment. He gave me his contact number for any help if I need, till I\
  \ stay there, and he left bidding me farewell. \nIt was a memorable day in my life\
  \ because I learnt a lesson, \"Never judge anyone too soon and don't let your fear\
  \ conquer you\". That night, while lying on my bed I prayed to God for that man\
  \ who helped me with his whole heart and also to make me good at heart just like\
  \ him."
