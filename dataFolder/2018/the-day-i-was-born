Text: "Everything changed after that one moment\u2026. Moment as soon as my father\
  \ hit the ground when heart attack hit him. I never thought poverty could lead my\
  \ family to this stage. But it surely changed me as a person for my lifetime!  From\
  \ being self-obsessed and selfish about myself at all the times I changed for good.\n\
  \ It all began when I moved from a smaller city of India to the capital, New Delhi.\
  \ That move came with many challenges and many things to learn about life at a very\
  \ young age. I was only 5 when my parents decided to move cities for a better lifestyle\
  \ and opportunities for the family. Challenges associated with the move made me\
  \ independent because I had to face them on my own as my parents had a lot going\
  \ on at that time to keep us under a roof. Settling in the capital wasn\u2019t so\
  \ easy for us. \nPoverty hit us when my father was starting up his own financial\
  \ business. We didn\u2019t have much option other than sticking together as a family.\
  \ Staying positive and supporting each other was our biggest key to success. Financial\
  \ hardship and stress led my father to heart issues, which he could no longer handle.\
  \ That news busted out to us at three in the night through his heart attack.I was\
  \ shaken to see my father like that. The moment I grabbed him into my arms and drove\
  \ him to the nearest hospital taught me a lesson called \u201CLife\u201D. At that\
  \ moment I had realized I had been taking life for granted. Waiting for a taxi would\
  \ have caused a big loss, so that dilemma forces me to drive all through the way\
  \ all alone.\nDriving my father to the hospital was the longest journey itself.\
  \ A young teenager who was just learning driving drove his father safely to the\
  \ hospital. A couple of daily experience of driving helped me through. Watching\
  \ my dad drive, watching his footsteps move created an independent emergency driver\
  \ like me. My mom doesn\u2019t know how to drive then and I just took the responsibility\
  \ to save my father\u2019s life all alone. As soon as I jumped in the car my body\
  \ was moving automatically. There was no planning and no thinking included in that\
  \ journey of how to drive. I just kept driving till I reached the hospital and admitted\
  \ my father. A couple of hours later my mother called and questioned me how did\
  \ I drive my father here? I had nothing to say except I did what needed to be done.\
  \ All I learned from that experience was to give a try to everything and thinking\
  \ \u201CI can do that\u201D, make the difference in the society. That\u2019s what\
  \ I am living upon."
