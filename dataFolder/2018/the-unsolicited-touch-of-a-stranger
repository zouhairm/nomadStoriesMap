Text: "The pleasant yet pungent smell of burning incense and sandalwood accentuated\
  \ my hour-long morning walk on the banks of the Ganga. The sun rose over the ancient\
  \ temple city of Varanasi; slow and majestic, and yet, instantly intense. I had\
  \ reached this epicenter of Vedic wisdom, tradition and beliefs an evening earlier.\
  \ My mind was still taking in a lot, adjusting gradually to the culture shock of\
  \ being where I was. \n\nHowever, in the early morning solidarity of my own company,\
  \ surrounded by hundreds of bathers dipping in the holy river and fluttering their\
  \ lips in whispered prayers, I was feeling more too: I was getting out of my comfort\
  \ zone to experience 'new'. \n\nI was experiencing what letting go meant.  To accept\
  \ that the only control I had was of my own body and mind seemed enough. To my 'earlier-Christian-now-agnostic'\
  \ mind, it was necessary to break away from enforced religion, and revel in local\
  \ culture, native to so many. It's the feeling of being part of something much larger;\
  \ temporarily disconnected only by human divisions, and attainable only by truly\
  \ wanting it. In being in Varanasi, in that moment, I knew change was fleeting,\
  \ and I had to let the best come to me.\n\nVaranasi, being an ageless holy land,\
  \ was always home to thousands of believers, non-believers and everyone in the middle\
  \ of finding where their journeys led. Mystical men and women with varying degrees\
  \ of spirituality, mental prowess, other-worldliness and a very keen understanding\
  \ of human psyche inhabit the dusty banks of the Ganga, talking, smoking herb, and\
  \ laughing. Spiritually, they hold the power to fill you with fear, fill you with\
  \ awe, and even fill you with the graces that people travel the world seeking.\n\
  \nLike in most mixed societies though, there's always the occasional crook looking\
  \ to con the innocent. As I walked on, one such man seemed to veer towards me. Mystical\
  \ thoughts aside, I became alert to this oldish man's advances. Smiling, the man\
  \ shook my hand, gently toying around with my fingers, and then my entire right\
  \ arm. Applying pressures differently, the man was slowly but surely massaging me:\
  \ outside, in broad daylight, without even asking me.\n\nLetting go of your inhibitions\
  \ opens your eyes, quite literally. In not questioning the man's intent, I realized\
  \ that the man was a local masseur. Like the many masseurs dotting the river banks,\
  \ rubbing bodies, and talking life. \n\nI paid the man for the massage. I walked\
  \ on. There's no price to the conversation we had."
