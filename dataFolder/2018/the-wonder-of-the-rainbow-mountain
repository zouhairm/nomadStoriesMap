Text: Taking a trek to Peru's Vinincunca or the Rainbow Mountain was a decision that
  completely pushed me to the edge.At a height of 5200m it resembles a huge slice
  of cake with layers of colours.To reach there I was picked up around 0335 am that
  September morning.The guide named our group - the Champions.Outside the bus,the
  temperature was -5 degrees Celsius! We were presently at an altitude(4326 m), even
  higher than our base-Cusco.The mountain trail didn't appear strenuous for someone
  fit. But the slightest distance proved difficult to cover due to the high altitude
  and low level of oxygen.At breakfast the tour guide gave us a brief and warned us
  about the height we would be reaching.Head and stomach aches were common.For more
  serious ailments he was carrying first aid.He also recommended hiring horses to
  make the climb easier.We had to walk up to a certain level to reach the horse.That
  was possibly the most difficult climb of my life.On the horse I had to keep warm.The
  weather had now become sunny and less cold but it was windy.The ascent up to Rainbow
  Mountain was extremely panoramic.The Valley was dry and appeared to be painted with
  many colours.Every time we had to get off the horseback and walk in steep areas
  we gasped for breath.The horse was not permitted beyond a point near Rainbow Mountain
  after which we had to walk up.We huffed and puffed and finally made it to the top
  from where we could clearly view the coloured mountains.Hiking the Vinincunca itself
  is not permitted.Slightest steps felt tedious and I have never seen a group of young
  people struggle so much to complete a climb.Remember to acclimatize and first get
  used to the high altitude of Cusco itself.Oh, what a reward we got for our effort.
  So many colours.The hues were due to the natural mineral deposits there.The red
  was due to copper, black because of tungsten,yellow - sulphur and the light bluish
  colour was due to iron.Only three locations are home to the outstanding coloured
  mountains,Peru,Argentina and China.A grand bonus was a view of the Ausangate Mountain.This
  is one place where you can never take enough pictures.You can easily forget the
  filters on your camera, yet do complete justice to the natural colors of the mountain.
  Suddenly the sun disappeared and it started snowing! Four seasons in one day!An
  amazing twist of nature. Coping with the low oxygen and gradual ascent was difficult
  yet extremely rewarding .Luckily no one got sick or hurt in our group. We were the
  Champions!
