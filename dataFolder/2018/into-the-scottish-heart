Text: "During my last winter break, I finally made one of my dreams come to its expiring\
  \ date. A few friends and I took a road trip through the Scottish Highlands, sleeping\
  \ in a van, discovering Scotland\xB4s hidden treasure and making nature to our kingdom.\
  \ A van trip such as we did, gives you a better idea of what freedom feels like.\
  \ It is the freedom to choose your own road, to stop in places you urge to explore\
  \ a little more and make a deeper connection to the places you go. \nOn our way\
  \ up North, we had stopped by a Ceilidh we had heard of when talking to a group\
  \ of Scottish lads (as they call them) in a pub. Ceilidh is the Gaelic word to describe\
  \ a traditional Scottish and Irish social gathering that involves the celebration\
  \ of Celtic culture by the local community. Guided by the sounds of the fiddles\
  \ and pipes, people danced with each other to the rhythm of a certain choreography\
  \ with which everybody, except us, seemed acquainted. Our cluelessness about what\
  \ step to make next was charmingly winked at and we were taken along with the dancing\
  \ crowd. We imitated the, intrinsically easy, steps, bounced from one foot to the\
  \ other, danced in circles and were swung across the room until our sense of balance\
  \ abandoned us. This event was a lovely way to connect with the local culture and\
  \ understand the Scottish traditions a little better. \n\nWith the sun as our loyal\
  \ companion, the following days were filled with a beautiful imagery of hills, valleys,\
  \ mountains and lakes. Stillness enabled clear reflections in the water of the Scottish\
  \ lochs that contributed to an atmosphere of calmness and peacefulness. We were\
  \ witnesses to a spectacle of colours, with red, brown, purple and green taking\
  \ turns in decorating the scenery. We spotted wild animals, picturesque villages\
  \ and castles along our paths, took refuge in caf\xE9s seeking a little bit of cosiness\
  \ and stopped before sunset to set up our camp. We lived at the rhythm of the light,\
  \ chasing the sunlight until it was out of sight. We slept in the absolute darkness\
  \ beneath the starry skies to wake up to the sunrise. Especially this part of the\
  \ journey made us feel more connected to the pure and wild nature without interruptions\
  \ or distractions of industrial noises, people or human-made artefacts. This trip\
  \ was like travelling in a mindful way. It gave us the chance to slowly discover\
  \ the charm of Scotland, understand it a little better and make a valuable connection\
  \ to its nature, culture and people."
