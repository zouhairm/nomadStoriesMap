Text: "What better place to spend Halloween than in one of America\u2019s most haunted\
  \ cities - New Orleans. \n\nAfter a long day walking through the French Quarter,\
  \ listening to music and stuffing our faces, we started making our way home for\
  \ the night. \n\nWe were staying in Algiers, accross the Mississippi from the French\
  \ Quarter + crowds. About a ten minute ferry ride. \n\nOnce we crossed the river,\
  \ we decided to go for a moon lit walk. Afterall, it was Hallows Eve. \n\nCemeteries\
  \ on the other side of the river were patrolled by security but the gate to this\
  \ one was wide open. Wished I would have known that before climbing over the fence\
  \ and ripping a giant hole in my pants. \n\nSince the waterlevel is so high, all\
  \ of the graves and moseliums are above ground. It was a perfectly creepy place\
  \ for a game of hide + seek!\n\nWhen the seeker needed a hint, we would whistle\
  \ back + forth. I was hiding. My seeker was having trouble finding me (I\u2019m\
  \ kind of a ninja). He whistled. It sounded like he was getting closer. I whistled\
  \ back. Waited. He must be close. Silence. \n\nAll of the sudden, he came around\
  \ the corner, grabbed my hand and dragged me out of the cemetery. He was white as\
  \ a ghost. As we left, we jumped over a mud puddle and he hastily pointed to it\
  \ out to me as we hastily departed. \n\nHis arms were covered in goosebumps. I asked\
  \ what happened + braced myself for the story. He said when he returned my whistle,\
  \ there was a shadow standing in front of one of the moseliums - it looked at him..\
  \ + started walking towards him. He ran.  Jumped over a puddle.. but heard a splash\
  \ right behind him. \n\nThe shoe print I saw in the mud was not my seeker\u2019\
  s shoe - which were perfeclty flat. It looked like more of a dress shoe, with a\
  \ heel. An old shoe. We went home. An eerie feeling followed us. \n\nThe first night\
  \ we got home, I felt that eerie feeing again. We went to bed and my seeker fell\
  \ almost immediately into a deep sleep. This was odd as I always fall asleep first.\
  \ \n\nAs I was laying in bed, I heard a \u201Cscuff\u201D sound in the hallway.\
  \ Almost like a footstep on the carpeted floor. Seeker grumbled. I thought he may\
  \ have woken up so I asked \u201CDid you hear that?\n\nThen he said \u201CIt\u2019\
  s my friend\u201D.. Monotone\n\nConfused, I said \u201CWhat?!??!\u201D\n\n\u201C\
  He\u2019s standing right there\u201D\n\nThe room was pitch black. Something was\
  \ watching. \n\nI finally was able to rouse Seeker out of sleep. \n\nHe had no recollection\
  \ of any thing that just happened. \n\nI guess what happens in New Orleans, doesn\u2019\
  t always stay in New Orleans.."
