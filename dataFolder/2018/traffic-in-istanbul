Text: "I would have never thought to go to Istanbul. I read amazing historical fiction\
  \ books about it and knew some of its significant history, but I imagined it as\
  \ a place where bombs would be going off all the time. Dangerous. Risky. Scary.\n\
  \nBut as it happened, I ended up randomly having a very long layover in Istanbul\
  \ on my way to India in January. I was worried about this. What if the airport blows\
  \ up while I\u2019m there?!! But it was the only flight that made sense, so I had\
  \ to take it.\n\nAs it was getting closer to my flight time, I learned that Turkish\
  \ Airlines offers a free day tour of Istanbul if you have a long layover! I was\
  \ still worried going into the city, but how could I resist an easy free tour like\
  \ that\u2026 I would have to do zero work! They even provide free lunch! So my curiosity\
  \ and adventurous side won over, and I decided to go for it!\n\nWhen I got there,\
  \ I learned that I can either get a free hotel or free tour\u2026 I decided to stick\
  \ with the tour and get my own hotel! So I woke up, got to the airport early in\
  \ the morning, worried, but excited for the tour.\n\nI got on the tour bus, and\
  \ off I went into the city\u2026 And the first thing I see of it is traffic. Just\
  \ traffic. Normal people on their normal commute to work. Playing music, drinking\
  \ coffee, listening to music. It was the most normal scene in the world. Here I\
  \ was, imagining chaos and bombs going off, and instead, it\u2019s just the most\
  \ normal morning I could imagine. Just like in most cities in America. I almost\
  \ cried at how normal it was, and at how stupid my fear was.\n\nThe news makes us\
  \ so afraid, but the truth is, it's just normal people everywhere just trying to\
  \ go to work, pursue their dreams, provide for their families.\n\nI\u2019m glad\
  \ I didn\u2019t let my fear stop me from seeing the unbelievable Hagia Sophia, but\
  \ I definitely still have some fear of other countries that I\u2019m hoping to dispel\
  \ one day as I continue to travel. I\u2019ll be going back to Istanbul on purpose\
  \ next time!"
