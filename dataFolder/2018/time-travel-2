Text: "I stood looking down the cliffs edge that joined up to the Aegean Sea, as the\
  \ diamond surface winked back in all its splendour. Nothing had changed here in\
  \ forty odd years. The Mediterranean sun drenched the back of my neck as I curled\
  \ my toes against the unforgiving heat of rubber flipflops. I stretched my arms\
  \ out to the sky and as I did the wind snatched the piece of paper out of my hands.\
  \ \u201CReady?\u201D, he shouted.\nThe first time I walked up the donkey steps of\
  \ the sun soaked Greek island of Ios, I was twenty. It had taken me two days of\
  \ travelling to get to Greece via Frankfurt and a stifling seven-hour ferry ride\
  \ from the port of Piraeus in Athens. As the ship docked, my eyes drank it all in.\n\
  Ios island, final resting place of ancient Greek poet Homer, with a population of\
  \ just over 2,500 people and home for me for the next three months. The island was\
  \ not just a holiday destination but a magnet for the many Europeans that came in\
  \ search of a working-holiday. I quickly found a job as a waitress in a small restaurant\
  \ in the village or \u2018chora\u2019 to the locals. Often, after shifts, we would\
  \ sit and watch the sunsets as they sank behind the stone washed walls.\nAlong the\
  \ beach restaurants, Greek words would spill into the evenings. \u201COpa\u201D\
  ! old ladies dressed in black would shout, as they clinked ouzo in their tiny glasses.\
  \ This was Greek life, this was island life and for one hot summer, it became mine.\
  \ I bared my soul to the island and in return it gifted me with the joy of my first\
  \ love, George. Inspired by the spirit of the island, we felt compelled to capture\
  \ our plans of adventure that summer and compiled a wish list. Exchanging them,\
  \ we promised to read them to each other in a year! As the summer season came to\
  \ a close and the September temperatures began to fall, I returned home, so too\
  \ did George.  \nIts 2018, it\u2019s my birthday and I am sixty. Among the birthday\
  \ cards that hit the mat, I spy familiar handwriting I haven\u2019t seen for a long\
  \ time. The last thing I expected to see inside was the wish list I had written\
  \ forty years ago!\nOne month later, I find myself standing at that same cliffs\
  \ edge and feel twenty all over again. Looking down over the Aegean Sea below I\
  \ answer George\u2019s question, \u201CReady\u201D!  As we jump off the cliffs edge,\
  \ I stretch my arms up to the sky. \u201CI\u2019ve always wanted to time travel\u201D\
  , I shout to George, as we watch the paper flutter to the sea and become but two\
  \ silhouettes hang gliding into the Aegean skyline."
