Text: "Hawaii. A destination that springs to mind when you think \u201Choneymoon\u201D\
  . For me though, my experience there was anything but. It was better.\n\nIt was\
  \ October last year. My partner and I had just checked in to a hotel in Waikiki.\
  \ We were on a typical couples retreat. Not because we wanted to enjoy alone time\
  \ together - we were passed that point - Jetstar was offering return flights from\
  \ Brisbane for $700 and, honestly, we craved the opportunity to ignore each other\
  \ somewhere more exciting than home.\n\nOn arrival to our hotel we discussed the\
  \ strange choice of wallpaper before I tried to coax him outside to hit the shops.\
  \ His eschewed Adidas sneakers were still in tact so he declined. I yelled I\u2019\
  d had enough of his self-centred ways, took my suitcase and wheeled it out the door.\n\
  \nNow, whether his lack of enthusiasm to shop was reason enough to storm out on\
  \ him in an unfamiliar country, I\u2019m unsure, but I had committed the moment\
  \ the door shut behind me and god forbid my stubborn arse if I was going back. \n\
  \nFollowing my dramatic exit, I decided to leave the island then and there so I\
  \ booked the next flight to Oahu\u2019s neighbouring island Kauai. Aside from the\
  \ part where chickens roamed around the petrol pumps while I waited for my shuttle\
  \ bus at Kauai\u2019s only car rental facility, I felt oddly at ease. And when the\
  \ shuttle bus turned up 45 minutes late, I was comforted knowing I was on island\
  \ time.\n\nRiding along Kauai\u2019s main road, the air smelled of salt water, the\
  \ roads were winding and the hills rolling. Every few miles, imperfect little shacks\
  \ sat in pairs on one side, while waves lapped along the sandbank on the other.\n\
  \nEventually we arrived at a sandbank that would be my backyard for the next few\
  \ weeks, as the shack that I was about to share with an Argentinian hippy, sat only\
  \ metres back from the ocean shoreline. \n\nI didn't know it yet, but it\u2019s\
  \ here that I would discover real happiness. Whether it was eating raw fish and\
  \ fighting many a mild case of bowl discomfort, or hiking for hours to get a glimpse\
  \ of the beautiful and protected Na Pali Coast, or discovering Waimea Canyon and\
  \ making friends with a beached seal.\n\nI also didn\u2019t know that taking the\
  \ plunge to escape to an unfamiliar part of the world on my own, would leave me\
  \ feeling so fulfilled. \n\nYou can\u2019t cheat yourself out of a situation in\
  \ life. We all have to face our challenges. But if there is anything that I learned,\
  \ it\u2019s to spend time alone. There is solace to be found in getting lost with\
  \ yourself."
