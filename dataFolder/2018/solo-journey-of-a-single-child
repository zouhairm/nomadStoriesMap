Text: "Being an Indian single girl child, I was brought up in a very conventional\
  \ Indian way. A whole lot of restrictions were imposed and I was made to understand\
  \ that it is for my own good. The restrictions controlled things like my in-time\
  \ at home, the type of clothes that I wore, which friends to hang out with, so on\
  \ and so forth.\nTo be honest, I never had a problem with these restrictions and\
  \ my parents were okay if I extended the boundaries of them. The only thing which\
  \ was strictly followed was that I was not allowed to go alone anywhere except school\
  \ or college. This was also the only restriction that I had a problem with.\nI always\
  \ wanted to take a solo trip, just me and my backpack. When started college, the\
  \ urge for a solo trip grew even more powerful. I started looking into competitions,\
  \ exhibitions and presentations abroad. Abroad, because I knew my family won\u2019\
  t let me travel alone in India and it will be difficult for them to accompany me\
  \ due to their leaves with their organizations.\nThe opportunity knocked my door.\
  \ I was to present a paper in a technical conference at Singapore. My happiness\
  \ knew no bounds. My folks were happy because it was the best thing to happen academically.\
  \ Their easy consent was the last thing I expected.\nThe visa arrived and I left.\
  \ I stayed there for a week. On my first day, two unforgettable things happened.\
  \ First, I took a wrong turn. Consequently, I was stranded in a foreign country\
  \ for two hours before a kind native girl told me the way. I still think that I\
  \ was not able to thank her enough. She had the resources and she did not hesitate\
  \ to help a stranger. As if that was not enough, I tried tofu and arugula salad\
  \ for the first time in my life and was heavily disappointed. Being Indian, my palate\
  \ is spicier than what most cuisines offer. It was my first time and I could not\
  \ adjust to the taste of the food.\nSecond, after I decided to stay hungry till\
  \ I found a better option, I made my way to Gardens by the Bay. The place has manmade\
  \ structures called Supertrees. All the vegetation is grown on their walls. They\
  \ are regularly cut and taken care of by any man who can stand on a crane. That\
  \ sight was one to behold. It so happens that we love to click photographs of the\
  \ places we visit. Being so tired, my selfies were not all that great. An Ukrainian\
  \ lady offered help. A further talk revealed that she was headed to India next for\
  \ Panchkarma. She clicked a beautiful picture of me and my day ended on a great\
  \ note."
