Text: "The lush green mountains seem to be endless, every now and then white yurts\
  \ appear on the horizon. Wild flowers cover the grass where nomadic horses get tamed\
  \ as everyone is completely focused on the actions in front of them.\n\nThe local\
  \ woman and their young children gather in a safe distance as well as the travelers\
  \ who stopped their journeys at the picturesque Song K\xF6l Lake region in Kyrgyzstan.\
  \ All of them escaped their warm yurts and walked along the fresh meadows to be\
  \ part of the local attraction. - Kokboru also known as Goat Polo\n\nIt's easy to\
  \ forget your surrounding while you're been captured by following the rules of the\
  \ game. In Goat polo the ball is replaced by a headless dead goat that gets passed\
  \ from one player to the next one. There are no sticks, no kind of safety protection\
  \ for the players nor the horses, not even a single helmet.\n\nIn Kyrgyzstan, the\
  \ team consists of young boys as well as their fathers keeping the tradition alive.\
  \ During the short summer months the nomadic families move to the lake, erect their\
  \ yurts and let their horses roam free. Everyone has their tasks during the day,\
  \ the kids help their mother with cooking and keeping the yurt warm as the nights\
  \ get brutally cold. The women gather together to cook and also brew the locals\
  \ delicacy fermented mare's milk as the men spend their days with the horses. Their\
  \ lives are simple; they gather to share their stories and enjoy the beautiful scenery\
  \ as well as a game of Goat polo to escape their daily routines.\n\nThe break is\
  \ over and the second half starts, some players have been replaced and the tension\
  \ starts to grow. Everybody wants to win, the young players for the prize money\
  \ and their fathers for the pride and honor.\n\nThe horses collide and one of the\
  \ men falls on the ground; the women keep calm. They've seen accidents hundreds\
  \ of times before while their young boys climb horses around their mothers and their\
  \ fearlessness not just impresses but frightens as well. In a few years they'll\
  \ be the ones playing the rough game next to their older brothers and friends, always\
  \ worrying that no one gets injured or even dies.\n\nThe referee finally announces\
  \ the winner of the game and equally boys and men scream of joy and hold up the\
  \ dead goat as a trophy. They take photos together to prove their accomplishment\
  \ to friends and family back home. Slowly everybody goes back to their daily routines\
  \ before they gather the next time for the dangerous game of Kokboru."
