Text: "The kits were on all sides of me as I lay on my stomach among the shrubs. My\
  \ fingers, clutched tightly around my camera, were going numb from the icy wind.\
  \ However, I didn\u2019t dare breathe, let alone click the shutter to get a photo.\
  \ The black kit was bouncy, slinking cautiously toward me then retreating immediately.\
  \ I caught glimpses of white-tipped tails, flickering ears, and furry bodies moving\
  \ between the vegetation as they tumbled over one another. Then one kit began to\
  \ approach me, right in my line of sight. His gait stiffened as he tiptoed back\
  \ and forth in front of me until, unexpectedly, his head reached forward. His golden\
  \ coat shone like fire in the setting sun and I could see each bump on his wet nose,\
  \ each clump of dirt between his toes. But it was his amber eyes that spoke something\
  \ familiar to me. They conveyed curiosity and wariness, yet they were utterly unafraid.\
  \ His gaze held my attention as he moved even closer; suddenly, the tip of his tiny\
  \ nose met the glossy surface of my camera lens. I let out a shaky breath.\n\nThis\
  \ type of boldness was something I had never experienced in a wild mammal before,\
  \ especially a naturally shy species like a fox. Ironically, I was here on San Juan\
  \ Island, WA to study wildlife behavior, and as scientists we are told not to \u201C\
  anthropomorphize\u201D, which means projecting our own emotions onto animals. But\
  \ the invisible barrier meant to deter this concept was dissolving in this moment.\
  \ We could not truly communicate. We were two species separated by millions of years\
  \ of evolution. And yet, I couldn\u2019t help but feel that we were exchanging some\
  \ form of understanding between each other\u2014a genuine interest, a natural urge\
  \ to learn the unknown. \n\nI keep coming back to this remarkable encounter, toward\
  \ the beginning of my budding wildlife photography career, as one of the most unique\
  \ experiences of my life. Since then, I have been around the American West photographing\
  \ seemingly more impressive wildlife species: killer whales, grizzly bears, gray\
  \ wolves, bald eagles, and bighorn sheep to name a few. But this little fox, in\
  \ a few short seconds, taught me lessons that I will carry with me throughout my\
  \ future travels: expect the unexpected, find beauty in the simple things, and that\
  \ sometimes it\u2019s okay to let my scientific guard down."
