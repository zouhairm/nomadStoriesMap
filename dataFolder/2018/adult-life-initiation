Text: "I stood upon the bricks, covered by linen. The boxes were spread nearby: crispy\
  \ twirly \u201Cmurukku\u201D with dried beans; chili \u201Ckerepek\u201D of all\
  \ sizes in a polyethylene; pineapple and chocolate cookies in round metal packaging,\
  \ and Chinese cookies in plastic containers. \n\u201CSort out the shelves, put matching\
  \ stickers for each item, and then arrange everything in an attractive way. It is\
  \ going to be a prolific Deepavali\u201D - said Mr. Kelvin, my temporary boss. This\
  \ is how a 14-days promotion, dedicated to Hindu festival of lights, began for me\
  \ in AEON.\nWhen one just completes a degree, it is usually accomplished with a\
  \ frustration. Not sure about my peers, but the sunny August day of the last exam\
  \ brought me nothing but this. I barely had an idea, whether I want to get back\
  \ to my hometown or stay, as I have given up part of my soul to Kuala Lumpur.\n\
  Still indecisive about my further destiny, one day I texted the short message: \u201C\
  Good evening sir, my name is Sholpan. I\u2019m from Kazakhstan. I\u2019d like to\
  \ apply for the temporary position of a promoter in Mid Valley, but I know you only\
  \ accept locals, so most probably you\u2019d not consider me?\u201D The answer came\
  \ shortly: \u201CYes miss. Sorry\u201D\nI sighed. Well, there are many other options.\
  \ My younger sister was graduating from boarding school in three months, so I had\
  \ to think of the way of spending them wisely. A sudden ring interrupted my contemplations:\u201D\
  Miss...tell me your address, I\u2019d like to come and show you our products...\u201D\
  \nInstead of working in Mid Valley, a cozy shopping mall in the city center, they\
  \ sent me to 1Utama, 3 hours away from my apartment. The job was from 10 am to 10\
  \ pm 14 days in a row. I was too desperate for the job. Plus I was curious and enthusiastic.\
  \ It was one of the most salient time of my life indeed. \nOn the first day, dozens\
  \ of Chinese, Indians, Malay and foreigners occupied my rack. Most of the customers\
  \ were amiable and chatted with me with pleasure. On day 3, I accidentally met another\
  \ girl from my country, who stayed just nearby 1Utama, and who offered me her room\
  \ to stay.\nWhen the promotion was over, I thanked Mr. Kelvin for presenting me\
  \ the opportunity to become a first foreigner ever, who managed to get the part-time\
  \ job, even though the reason for it remains the mystery for me until today. I came\
  \ back to my apartment with a Christian brochure, three blue eye pendants, a couple\
  \ of emails from customers, four packages of cookies, and the batch of cash as my\
  \ salary. What an initiation into adult life."
