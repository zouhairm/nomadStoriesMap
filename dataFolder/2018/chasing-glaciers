Text: "The sign gave me two options, take the trail back to where I started or hike\
  \ a second path which would add a few hours in this everlasting torrential downpour.\
  \ I debated for a minute, but the decision was easy. I was in the land of fire and\
  \ Ice for the first time. Without hesitation, I started for Sjonarnipa viewpoint\
  \ and a birdseye view of of Vatnajokull, Iceland\u2019s largest glacier.\n\nMore\
  \ hiking didn\u2019t sound great, but I was dry inside my rain gear, my five layers\
  \ were keeping me warm, and I was looking forward to the view of the glacier. As\
  \ the rain powered down and I continued up the narrow trail, I noticed the terrain\
  \ getting steeper. It wasn\u2019t long before I was walking through a small stream\
  \ of rapidly flowing water. That\u2019s when I started to feel my socks dampen.\
  \ The water had made it into my waterproof boots. It\u2019s a miracle it took this\
  \ long as the rain was pouring down at a rate I didn\u2019t know was possible. Then,\
  \ a few minutes later, things got real bad.\n\nAll my waterproof gear began to fail.\
  \ My gloves were soaked, fingers freezing. My pants stuck to my legs, underwear\
  \ wet. My waterproof jacket was drenched, the four layers underneath damp. I was\
  \ so cold I began to shiver. The rain, wind, and cold were not going to let up.\
  \ I had a decision to make, turn back and get down the trail fast or test my endurance\
  \ and power through. I hadn\u2019t seen a soul. No one was crazy enough to hike\
  \ in this weather. Why was I? Was this a horrible decision? There was only one way\
  \ to find out. I continued on to finish what I started.\n\nI had no idea how much\
  \ further. Each sloshing step felt like I was wearing weights. I wanted to declare\
  \ defeat, but what would I do? Wait for help? It may never come. Besides, in Iceland\
  \ there are no trees, which meant no cover from the elements. I tried not to focus\
  \ on the fact that I was probably becoming hypothermic. Instead, I kept telling\
  \ myself no pain no gain. I knew that if I gave up I would regret it, so I kept\
  \ on.\n\nFinally, some time later, there it was through the cloudy grey sky, a massive\
  \ white glacier tongue wedged between two mountains. At the base was a body of water\
  \ with broken icebergs dancing atop. The view was absolutely breathtaking. I took\
  \ it in for several minutes, relishing my win. The bitter cold and never-ending\
  \ rain didn\u2019t matter anymore. I felt rejuvenated. I felt alive. I was the only\
  \ person viewing this site, at this moment, in these elements. It was something\
  \ I would never forget."
