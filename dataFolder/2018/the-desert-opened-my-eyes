Text: "I arrived in the desert of Chegaga after hours of car and conversation, the\
  \ guide and driver was a young boy (Moha), who luckily spoke Spanish because he\
  \ had been six years in Barcelona, \u200B\u200Band that gave me the opportunity\
  \ to know his culture and his life in an unexpected depth. Previously we stopped\
  \ in a small town where the economy depended on the clay objects that they built\
  \ for daily life: vases, plates, tajine, trays ... I managed to sit in a hole in\
  \ the ground and hit the pedals of the lathe trying create something useful, living\
  \ for a few minutes as they do there.\nThe desert left me in awe, I had imagined\
  \ it endless times, but being there was not the same as dreaming or imagining it.\
  \ Dunes, sky, stars and some jaimas ... a camel with his friend tuareg and an Arab\
  \ gentleman who received us with a kind smile and a lot of silence. The camel ride\
  \ and Abdul's whistling between the dunes was a unique sensation of freedom, like\
  \ a four-dimensional meditation. Back at the carp, the man taught me how to prepare\
  \ the taj\xEDn and how to make bread under the desert sand. Once the food is prepared,\
  \ we all sit on the floor and start the ritual, eating with our hands, not with\
  \ both, only with the right (for their culture, using the left would be very badly\
  \ seen, it is only used for tasks \"impure\"). We started to communicate mixing\
  \ Arabic, French and Spanish, we all helped each other, the language did not matter,\
  \ the desire to get to know each other was enough despite not speaking the same\
  \ language. There is no better tool than the intention, the desire to know and share\
  \ is enough to learn and know two nomads with lives very different from mine.\n\
  I had heard about people who came illegally to Spain, but without a doubt, listening\
  \ to someone who lived it was very shocking, seeing his face and his tone of voice\
  \ when explaining how he arrived under a truck and the atrocities that happened\
  \ once in Spanish It lands is difficult. His reason for starting this dangerous\
  \ adventure was to improve his life, because some acquaintances had achieved it\
  \ and had returned with expensive cars and money. It is the story of Moha, who turned\
  \ out to be \"my guide\", a tour guide who became a friend and inspiration for my\
  \ life; I appreciate your time and your friendship, and the little piece of world\
  \ you taught me."
