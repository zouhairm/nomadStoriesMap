Text: "The bus was an escapade, a 518 km long ride during a cold winter night before\
  \ the New Year without my family having an idea about my whereabouts. It was not\
  \ an ideal time to go to Himachal Pradesh, the last of December, but I had to know\
  \ what the mountains spoke. I opened my eyes after 7 hours and the morning felt\
  \ abnormal. The grating sounds of movable motors did not wake me up this morning.\
  \ The trails and the steppes of Himalayas watched the passage standing still, outpouring\
  \ white water into the linns. The stream of Parvati smoked clouds onto its shore,\
  \ the morning was unlike any other, I heard the river flow. \n\"Let's go, this is\
  \ Bhuntar, we need to take another bus\", said my boyfriend. Kasol was still 31.2\
  \ kilometers away, a hamlet beside river Parvati at an elevation of 1,580 m, way\
  \ above than the North Indian plain. The people in the mountains persist specks\
  \ of innocence, they are dissimilar to everybody else in the world. The second thing\
  \ I witnessed. \nKasol is famous for giving rise to stoners, it is a small base\
  \ to rest before trekkers begin their treks. I trekked to Chalaal, the trek kisses\
  \ Parvati and its boulders. The moon lights up every strand of the river, the flow\
  \ is loud but the frequency is calming and water is shining, it is a spectacle.\
  \ The snowy tops of the Himalayas in Tosh adds to the variety of the mountains in\
  \ the valley. Tosh is a village, 2900 m above on a hill where I spent my next night\
  \ . The trek began from Barshaini, a taxi dropped us there, it was harsh, more like\
  \ climbing a mountain and I was panting. The little boys at Barshaini said,\" it\
  \ would take 40 minutes to Tosh through this trek\". Well, it took us 120 minutes.\
  \ The frequent rests on the top of the mountain were reviving. The air was so fresh\
  \ as if it was just produced to breathe in. There were snowy mountains to our left\
  \ and the lush green steppes to our right, the view down was streaming wet, it was\
  \ breathtaking. The slope was testing our feet and Tosh was still 1 kilometer away.\
  \ the last of the distance had us walk with sticks.\nTosh was nearly there and the\
  \ white mountains too. We were relieved, the air was pure, our lungs were healed,\
  \ it was another world of health. The night was chiding with -12 degrees, freezing\
  \ our mere cells but we still sat not too apart from the moon lit river and the\
  \ snowy hills."
