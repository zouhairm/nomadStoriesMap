Text: "I was sweating beside Paul, my local host on a hot and humid night in Guam.\
  \ We met earlier that day through a travel website and found ourselves enjoying\
  \ Chamorro culture together - eating barbeque and watching traditional dance. Frequent\
  \ moves and work commitments led to meaningless connections for me over the past\
  \ two years. Resigned to my loneliness, I embarked on my first international trip\
  \ - alone. As it often happens between men, the topic of romance found its way into\
  \ our discussion. I listened enviously about the love he found while hosting women\
  \ in the past. Paul was a pleasant host, but this felt like just another shallow\
  \ friendship.\n\nDays later in the Philippines, that same travel website allowed\
  \ me to make plans with another local. Her profile had no picture to let me know\
  \ who I was looking for the day we met.\n\n\u201CMike?\u201D I turned around, greeted\
  \ by a welcoming smile that caught me off-guard. She wore a summer dress over sun-kissed\
  \ skin that came from living on a tropical island. \n\nHana took me to a food bazar\
  \ occupied by a dozen stalls. The mixed aroma from local delicacies such as fish\
  \ balls, coagulated chicken blood, and pork intestines was mouthwatering. My adventurous\
  \ palate was excited by her selections for our meal. Thinking of a local delicacy\
  \ I did consider to be exceptionally bizarre, I asked her if she ever tried balut,\
  \ a hardboiled egg with a partially developed embryo inside. She had and recommended\
  \ I try it. I respectfully declined.\n\nDays later, we went to her favorite pub.\
  \ We had an insatiable desire to know each other\u2019s thoughts on every topic,\
  \ to include religion, politics, philanthropy \u2013 noting similarities and discussing\
  \ the differences. The bartender asked how long we had been dating, remarking that\
  \ we interacted like longtime friends. Hana\u2019s non-judgmental attitude let me\
  \ speak freely. Though English was her second language, she communicated an intelligent\
  \ opinion on a variety of topics. Conversations with her were healing for my anxious\
  \ soul. I wondered why it took me a trip to the other side of the world to meet\
  \ a personality like hers.\n\nWe left the bar around midnight, the moon shining\
  \ down on us as we walked. Along the way, Hana bought balut. She asserted my Pinoy\
  \ experience would not be complete until I tried it, but my western palette caused\
  \ me to wince at the suggestion. She then presented me with a deal - if I tried\
  \ some, I would get a kiss. I only paused to smile at Hana before I took my first\
  \ bite."
