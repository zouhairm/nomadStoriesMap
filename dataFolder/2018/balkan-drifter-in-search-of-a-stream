Text: "They told me they were poor, as if wealth was the goal of a traveler. Of course\
  \ they were not poor, they were rich in sights, rich in achievements, rich in joy.\
  \ They told me there was nothing to see there. Of course, there was everything to\
  \ see, a whole world, crowded on the shores of a mighty river. They told me the\
  \ city was dirty. Of course it was, dirt is a part of life, and God, was this city\
  \ alive.\nWhen the train slowed down and we approached Belgrade, I impatiently went\
  \ near the window to see her. All of the sudden, there she was. The mighty, beautiful\
  \ Danube, the lifeblood of my people, splitting Belgrade like a bolt of lightning\
  \ splits the skies. You could tell she was impatient, she needed to get home, to\
  \ our common Romanian land, to give homage to our sea. But the Black Sea was far\
  \ away, and the Danube was here and right now it wasn't the Danube (or Dunare as\
  \ we call it in Romania), it was Duna and it was Serbian and she was not mine to\
  \ claim here.\nWhat could I possibly do on a Sunday, in May, in Belgrade all by\
  \ myself? The streets were roaming with people and music was roaring and the city\
  \ was determined to show me that the image of the impoverished Balkans was more\
  \ and more closer to becoming a myth. \nWhen I travel, my feet are no longer connected\
  \ to my body. They don't need a brain signal, they know what I want to see. I want\
  \ history and culture and music, and, whenever given the chance, a mountain to climb.\
  \ \nThe walls of the Belgrade Fortress were heavy with history and that's were my\
  \ feet carried me, inside their centuries-old walls, prepared to witness the greatness\
  \ of history. But I was in for a surprise. The walls were there, and the history\
  \ of all the battles they fought and the wars they lost was lingering like a shadow,\
  \ a shadow that sneaks out of the Fortress and sometimes sits on the bombed buildings,\
  \ sad remembrance of a tragic war that plagued the Balkans only two decades ago.\
  \ \nBut inside this fortress, there was no sadness, there were just blooming trees\
  \ and a miracle, a spontaneous burst of energy that only the Balkans can give you.\
  \ An old man suddenly started playing the accordion, a popular tune I assume, because\
  \ everyone around him bursted into song. And it that precise moment I saw them,\
  \ the Serbians. the most beautiful people I have ever seen, singing in a fortress,\
  \ in a sunny spring, with the trees heavy with history and blood and flowers, the\
  \ blood and flowers we are cursed to carry forever with us in the Balkans."
