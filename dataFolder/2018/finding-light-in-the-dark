Text: "It was -7 degrees, my phone was dead, everything was either frozen or closed,\
  \ and I was cursing myself for hopping on a plane to Norway. My bright yellow jacket\
  \ seemed to be a cruel joke against the night air blowing off the dark, frozen fjords.\n\
  \ \n\"Does the sun even exist here?\" I wondered as I stuffed my lifeless hands\
  \ farther into my jacket and continued passing boat after boat, \"Or did I land\
  \ at the edge of the world by mistake?\" As I headed towards my room for the night,\
  \ two men walking towards me came into shape.\n \nI scurried by, and the taller\
  \ of the two called out which I dismissed with a wave of my bare hand. But the thinness\
  \ of my coat gave away my need for assistance, and both men turned to crunch their\
  \ way through the ice-topped snow towards me. Whether it was early onset hypothermia,\
  \ or my preference to the fight vs. the flight response, I stopped in my tracks\
  \ at the edge of the wooden dock.\n \nTheir long beards were flecked with snow,\
  \ and their fur hats seemed to tower over me. I shouted over the wind, \"I'm looking\
  \ for Adina. She has a boat on -\"\n \n\"ADINA?\" they both roared, \"she thought\
  \ you dead!\"\n \nAnd while I too thought I was close to death, I smiled though\
  \ it made my teeth cold, nodded though I felt like crying, and followed my two saviors\
  \ to the smallest boat I had ever seen.\n \nAs I ducked my head through the door,\
  \ Adina, a stunningly pretty woman with platinum hair and nose rings, turned and\
  \ dripped with laughter at the sight of me.\n \n\"Poor child,\" she cooed, and handed\
  \ me a drink.\n \nThe four of us quickly became friends. We swapped stories about\
  \ growing up, travels, and love lost. I ate my first anchovy, smoked my first cigar,\
  \ and tried my best to replicate the words they had me repeat, though I was certain\
  \ I was swearing like a Norwegian sailor. I only understood half of what they said,\
  \ and they understood even less from me, but we didn't care.\n \nWe finally made\
  \ our way to the bow. They were faint at first, then in an instant became clear\
  \ as day. Blues, greens, and pinks painted the sky - who needs the sun when you\
  \ have the northern lights? They make you feel as if you can do anything on earth,\
  \ yet make you feel as though you are the smallest thing on the planet.\n \nHalf-drunk,\
  \ gazing at the northern lights, surrounded by strangers turned friends, it was\
  \ hard for me to imagine my life without experiencing this. It made me wonder how\
  \ many nights like this are waiting for me to grab them? And how many have I missed\
  \ because I was scared?"
