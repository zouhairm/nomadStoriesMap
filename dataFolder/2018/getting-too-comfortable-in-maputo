Text: "The last thing I expected was that we would have guns pointed at us while sightseeing\
  \ in Maputo. \n\nMy brother, six of our friends and I were on a New Year getaway\
  \ in Marloth Park, a wildlife holiday town in South Africa. We were 40 minutes away\
  \ from the Mozambique border and decided to take a day trip to Maputo, the country\u2019\
  s capital. \n\nAs we soon as we crossed the border into Mozambique, I sensed a strange\
  \ feeling in the car, a mixture of excitement and anxiety. We realised just how\
  \ vulnerable we were considering the stories we had heard that corrupt law enforcement\
  \ officers try to extort money from tourists. \n\nWhen we arrived in Maputo I couldn\u2019\
  t help but notice how the buildings tell a story about the country\u2019s history.\
  \ Portuguese colonial architecture can be found throughout the city and bullet holes\
  \ on the walls of many buildings are a reminder of the Mozambican civil war. Our\
  \ first stop was the larger than life statue of the first President of independent\
  \ Mozambique, Samora Machel. We then headed to Maputo Central Station, an impressive\
  \ structure with a large central dome that was designed by an associate of Alexandre\
  \ Gustav Eiffel (of Eiffel Tower fame). \n\nWe decided to drive around the palm-tree\
  \ lined beachfront before sitting down for lunch. My brother was seated on the front\
  \ passenger seat, now and again he would extend his hand outside the window to get\
  \ a better camera shot. We were in total bliss as we cruised around with the windows\
  \ rolled down. \n\nAs we turned into a quiet road, we were suddenly terror-stricken\
  \ at the sight of two camouflage-clad men pointing what looked like AK47 machine\
  \ guns at us. They hastily signalled us to stop and told my brother to get out of\
  \ the vehicle. The look on their faces said, \u2018I won\u2019t hesitate to use\
  \ this gun\u2019. It was dead quiet in the car as my brother spoke to them outside,\
  \ we were all paralysed with fear.\n\nThey abruptly started walking towards a building\
  \ with my brother and my immediate thoughts were, \u2018we cannot let them isolate\
  \ him\u2019. I went for the door handle but the men angrily gestured at me to get\
  \ back inside and we watched them walk inside the building. Every minute of waiting\
  \ felt like an hour. \n\nMy brother eventually came out and told us they wanted\
  \ money because apparently we are not allowed to film government buildings (any\
  \ reason to extort money from tourists if you ask me). Relieved that he won\u2019\
  t be detained or wasn\u2019t bruised, we complied."
