Text: "I hate British people. This should come as a surprise to you, as I\u2019m a\
  \ Dutch girl who consciously made the choice to move to United Kingdom, four years\
  \ ago and has been living there ever since.\nBut I truly madly deeply hate them.\
  \ \nThere are so many reasons I could give you of why I hate them; they\u2019re\
  \ just so overly polite, they call everyone and everything love and darling, but\
  \ the most important reason is that in London (where I live) you just never see\
  \ them. They are never there. And it\u2019s infuriating. Who can I yell at about\
  \ Brexit, if they aren\u2019t even around? If they\u2019re hiding in their little\
  \ bubbles sipping tea?! It\u2019s safe to say I was fed up, and I decided that I\
  \ wanted to go looking for British people at the only other place I could think\
  \ of, the famous former colony of England: Malta.\n\nSo, that\u2019s where I went.\
  \ By myself.  After a horrendous journey of meeting no British people, I got to\
  \ my hostel room. There were 3 guys sitting in the room. They were drinking beer\
  \ and playing techno music. The room was almost covered in beer cans and I grew\
  \ more hopeful, these guys HAD to be British, right?! \n\u2018Hi, I\u2019m Joris.\u2019\
  \ \u2018Hi, I\u2019m Clement.\u2019 \u2018Hi, I\u2019m Leon\u2019. Those aren\u2019\
  t British names. My heart sank, but I didn\u2019t want to give up \u2018Where are\
  \ you guys from?\u2019\n\u2018Switzerland\u2019\nReady to go home and forget about\
  \ my endeavor, the boys asked me to go out with them. To a karaoke bar. Where to\
  \ my surprise, I again didn't meet any British people nor did I turn into Gabriella\
  \ from High School Musical and sang a love duet with one of the boys.\nHowever,\
  \ I did end up talking to one of them. Leon. About our fears, our passions, God,\
  \ our families, and about relationships. How stupid people were who even attempted\
  \ to be in a long-distance relationship. That could never work. \n\nAfter, he took\
  \ me to the beach. It was a full moon. Twinkle lights were shining bright. \u2018\
  Ew- so romantic\u2019. He joked. \n\nI looked at him. He looked at me. And then,\
  \ I felt it, the moment was there. Our mouths were like magnets, drawing closer\
  \ to each other very slowly, I could feel his breathe on my lips, his lips came\
  \ closer and my heart was pounding out of my chest.\n\nAnd then I heard them. British\
  \ people. Yelling, shouting, drunk. They splashed into the pool, they fell over\
  \ and they chucked beers at us. \n\n\u2018Let\u2019s just go to sleep?\u2019 \u2013\
  \ I hate British people."
