Text: "It was overwhelming. I walked out of the Ho Chi Minh airport in Vietnam and\
  \ the air was suffocating. I was used to hot weather but this was different because\
  \ it felt like there was no air outside. I kept looking around for the people I\
  \ knew. \u201CWhat am I doing, what am I searching for here?\u201D I saw my hosts\
  \ waving at me with smiling faces and wet foreheads. I hugged them and took the\
  \ first photo of my three months staying in Vietnam. \nThe next day I flew to Gia\
  \ Lai, the province where I would teach English to kids and young adults. I was\
  \ expecting to live in a woodsy house, alongside a river, waking up early in a sleepy\
  \ village and learning to meditate when sitting on the grass.\nWhen I arrived at\
  \ the final airport, I met Xuy\xEAn, the woman who hired me. She was wearing a dress,\
  \ her hair was short. She seemed worried. I hugged her and that caught her by surprise.\
  \ \u201CI am a hugger\u201D \u2013 I told her. I listened to her on our way home\
  \ and I promised to help her with her English skills. She said \u201CI am poor.\
  \ Everyone knows that I'll bring a foreign teacher in our province and will come\
  \ in my center.\u201D \nIt took us half an hour to arrive at the center. The yellow\
  \ board with the Vietnamese writing on it, seemed smaller than what I had imagined\
  \ from the photos she had sent me on Facebook. I found myself crying the first nights,\
  \ terrified by the dirt and tasteless food but I decided to stay. One day a Vietnamese\
  \ teacher asked my forgiveness for her calling a student accidentally by my name.\
  \ Her humbleness woke me up. I bought a dog and took him with me in a farm. I raised\
  \ a kitten. After a month, I could feel the wind tear up something in my soul, something\
  \ that I hadn\u2019t bound very well. I fell in love with my work, I loved the kids.\
  \ Everyone wanted to touch my \"western\" nose and share their stories with me.\
  \  \nBefore taking that plane, I was looking for acceptance from people who couldn\u2019\
  t accept themselves, and now I was surrounded by love and appreciation from these\
  \ little kids and fellow teachers who saw nothing but thoughtfulness and altruism\
  \ in me. They viewed me as someone courageous and as someone who lived a life they\
  \ had only dreamed of. I had felt completely lost, my ego shell had left the country\
  \ feeling so thin and leaving my soul so vulnerable to the world. I went there looking\
  \ for something else, for a solution to my unresolved inner issues, to learn something\
  \ new, and I met the old me; the passionate, loving and courageous me. That was\
  \ the longest trip of my life."
