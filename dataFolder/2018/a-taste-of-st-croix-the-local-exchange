Text: "While I am a morning person, prying myself from my sheets at six in the morning\
  \ remains to be a struggle. I was visiting the island of St. Croix to study a gravesite\
  \ at an abandoned sugar plantation formerly known as Estate Bethlehem. My schedule\
  \ on the island was tightly reserved, but on this Saturday morning, I happened to\
  \ have a day off.\n     My travels took me to La Reine, a local food market only\
  \ open on early Saturday mornings. It was under a small pavilion with yellow support\
  \ beams and a white roof. A variety of merchants lined up under the pavilion tables\
  \ each contributing to a mosaic of local foods. The market was a labyrinth to me;\
  \ I barely recognized any of the foods. Even the local bananas were smaller than\
  \ the ones I am accustomed to in the United States. I settled on some cucumbers,\
  \ mangos, and peppers with the intent of making a fresh salad but I still desired\
  \ to get something I have never had before; something unique to the island. \n Making\
  \ my exit I noticed a table with round yellow fruit I had not seen before and asked\
  \ the two ladies sitting in foldable lawn chairs what they were.\n\u201CPassion\
  \ fruit, would you like some?\u201D she said bundling three in her hands.\n\u201C\
  Sure, why not,\u201D I said curiously, handing her the money in exchange for a small\
  \ brown paper bag packed with passion fruit. My naivety about the fruit must have\
  \ been as transparent as the woman\u2019s face; it was clear to her that I had no\
  \ idea what to do with them.\n\u201CDo you know how to eat it?\u201D she asked before\
  \ I made my exit.\n\u201CNo,\u201D I said letting out a small shy laugh. She smiled\
  \ at me grabbing a smaller passion fruit from her table where she cut open for me.\n\
  \u201CYou eat everything inside but the seeds,\u201D she said. It was easier said\
  \ than done given they were tightly packed together. While I tediously extracting\
  \ the slimy seeds from the fruit, the rewards for my labor proved to be quite delicious.\
  \ \n        A genial warmth was felt from around the table. I was grateful to the\
  \ locals for sharing this part of their culture with me, my taxi driver even said\
  \ he would make passion fruit juice for us when we got home. Clearly, passion fruit\
  \ was an important piece to a larger part of the island\u2019s food culture. It\
  \ is the people of the island that hold the key to everything edible, sharing this\
  \ knowledge for those who seek it. While the experience only lasted a moment, it\
  \ was not the last encounter I had with the numerable tastes of St. Croix."
