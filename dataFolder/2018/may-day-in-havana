Text: "\"I don't think I'll be able to get you any closer...\" \n\nThe traffic in\
  \ Havana was bumper to bumper with no sign of moving. Wilmer nervously fingered\
  \ the rosary beadings hanging from his rear-view mirror while looking for a gap\
  \ in which to squeeze his creaking Chevy. He was fiercely proud of his car; its\
  \ original metallic blue slowly being eaten away by the pools of orange rust radiating\
  \ across the exterior. It had been off the road for 3 months while Wilmer waited\
  \ for a single replacement part. This was his first run out in it.\n\nI fiddled\
  \ with the dashboard dial hoping to hear some information crackling through the\
  \ ancient speakers. Excitable chatter fizzed and popped at a dizzying pace but only\
  \ the occasional yell of \"Viva Cuba!\" was clear through the static.\n\n\u201C\
  There are a lot of people here...\" I mused, nodding towards the busses filled with\
  \ uniformed Cubans. He nodded, lost in the vehicular chaos. Probing him about the\
  \ May Day activities was proving impossible.\n\nI reached down to wind up the window.\
  \  I was willing to put up with the stifling heat inside the car if it meant avoiding\
  \ the sooty exhaust fumes emanating from the street.\n\nThe morning sun was beginning\
  \ to illuminate the crumbling, brightly coloured facades flanking the street. Voyeurs\
  \ sat on the ramshackle balconies waving at the crowd as a cacophony of reggaeton\
  \ and cheers radiated from below.\n\n\u201CPeople look like they\u2019re having\
  \ fun though\u2026\u201D\n\nWilmer shifted in his seat and gave me a look, one that\
  \ said he didn't want to talk about it. His opinion of the Cuban government was\
  \ clear, if unspoken.  \u201CMost people want to attend,\u201D Wilmer reassured\
  \ me, diplomatically. \u201CThe majority are here for the fiesta, others are forced,\
  \ a few want to show support for the government.\u201D\n\n\"And you?\" I asked him.\
  \ Wilmer squirmed again. \"No...I think....\" he trailed off and returned to staring\
  \ out into the street.\n\nWith that, I left Wilmer to deal with the congestion and\
  \ walked the remainder of the journey, squeezing through the metal barriers to merge\
  \ with the pulsating river of red, white and blue flowing down Paseo Boulevard.\n\
  \nImmediately I was sucked in to the carnival atmosphere of the crowd marching on\
  \ Plaza de la Revolucion. Dancing Cubans grip my shoulder to exclaim, \"Welcome\
  \ to Cuba!\" thrusting their half-empty bottles of Havana Club towards me. 'La Bayamesa'\
  \ rang out from the speakers lining the avenue and the crowd sang along in a deafening\
  \ chorus. In this part of Havana at least, the revolution was still very much alive."
