Text: "It was my first time in the Philippines. We arrived in Puerto Princesa, a little\
  \ town in the middle of Palawan.\nWe shared a van with a couple of interesting people\
  \ on our way to El Nido, a small village in the north of the island. After a seven\
  \ hour drive we arrived and took a \"tricycle\" - a motorbike with a side car -\
  \ to the \"Together Pension\", where we were waiting for Raffy, the owner of the\
  \ \"Cabanas de Nacpan\", which we booked for our stay. After about five minutes\
  \ a handsome young Filipino smiled at us and introduced himself as Raffy. His laugh\
  \ and his whole appearance was just sympathetic. After he made sure we were good\
  \ to go on a motorbike, we followed him to the Cabanas. We arrived after one hour\
  \ and and sat down and talked with Raffy right away. He told us that he just opened\
  \ three months ago and is already booked out for the next two months. He has just\
  \ five tents and no Wi-Fi, but as I looked around I could feel the paradise surrounding\
  \ me. The green nature, the warm air, the gecko that shouted in the water pipes...\
  \ As we drank our welcome beer people came back from their day trip and joined us.\
  \ We talked for hours before we actually saw our \"room\" which was a huge tent\
  \ with the most comfortable bed ever. For a reason they told us to not touch the\
  \ bed before we want to go to sleep...\nThe next days we went to the waterfalls,\
  \ did a boat tour, had some barbecues or just went to the beach to watch the sunset.\
  \ We talked about how we would open a bar next to his accommodation and how he will\
  \ visit us back in Europe. The most bonding moment for myself was when we climbed\
  \ up the mountains and went over a bridge -\n hundreds of meters high. I got scared\
  \ and was very nervous. But he was just there making sure I would feel better. He\
  \ didn't say a lot. He just looked at me and said \"you will do it\". Not in a demanding\
  \ way, but as if he talked to my soul, saying I can get over my fear and float on\
  \ my pride over that bridge. I couldn't believe how easy it was and I'm thankful\
  \ of how he supported me.\nAfter our week was over Raffy brought us to the van that\
  \ took us back to Puerto. Saying bye to Raffy was the hardest thing. He seemed to\
  \ be nervous and said he couldn't wait for the van to depart because he is bad with\
  \ goodbyes. We hugged for minutes that felt like ages. It was hard to let go. And\
  \ as I got in the van and watched him drive away I knew it wouldn't be a goodbye\
  \ for forever. But as the van started its engine I couldn't hold back the tears."
