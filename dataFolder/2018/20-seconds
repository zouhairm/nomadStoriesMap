Text: "Finals were over. My junior year was completed. Consumed by being tired, worn\
  \ out, and the desire for a well-deserved RR. All my friends and I were packing\
  \ up to leaving behind the college ways for the summer until we all joined back\
  \ in the fall for our senior year. Dreading the return of going back to the small\
  \ town I grew up in; a wave of imputation soaked me. Within 20 seconds a decision\
  \ was made.  Summer became a mission to break the walls down and explore. A backpack\
  \ of clothing and out the door. Not a plan, map, or designation in mind.\nWhile\
  \ driving, I began to repeatedly see signs that read \u201COuter Banks\u201D. The\
  \ arrows directed me through country roads, marshlands, over bridges, and straight\
  \ into a sunset. The sky filled up with shades pinks, blues, purples, and orange.\
  \  My car began to accelerate faster and faster until I hit the sand. My heart guided\
  \ me to a sleepy beach town of surfers and yoga teachers. A place that one only\
  \ dreams of living in.\nI hopped back in my car and drove until the road ran out.\
  \ On the corner of the sand and road stood a bar. Nothing special, just a small\
  \ burger shack with an amazing view. Eating fries while gazing out at the stars\
  \ dangling over the ocean. It was as if they were trying to get a better look at\
  \ their reflection in the ocean. I fell hard; head over heels in love with a place.\
  \ I turned to the bartender and asked for an application. Now, six years later,\
  \ that wild adventure turned into my forever home. Every morning is spend say hello\
  \ to the ocean. Every night I say sweet dreams to the sun over the sound. The Outer\
  \ Banks is like no where I have ever been. It only took 20 seconds to find."
