Text: "White dupatta draped over our faces, matching with our white kurtha-pyjama,\
  \ to protect us from scorching heat of dessert, we regretted the decision of roaming\
  \ around the compound in mid-day and began pacing towards the meditation centre\
  \ we had been staying for past one week in Mt. Abu, Rajasthan. In midst of sand\
  \ blowing and the verge of getting heatstroke, we saw three local girls dressed\
  \ in red and black coloured traditional dress, ghagra choli, giggling walking towards.\n\
  \nOne of our group members decided to have a conversation with them.\n\nYesterday\
  \ evening when I came out of my shelter, I saw a group of local boys and girls gathered\
  \ outside the gate near a tree, laughing and sharing their gossips in Marwari. as\
  \ the sun slowly began disappearing on the horizon of a far stretched sand dunes,\
  \ pulling the night down along with it & the Aravalli hills stood calmly on the\
  \ opposite,  they lighted their lanterns and sat around it, singing their folklore,\
  \ ecstasy spread on their lit faces and after a while, they dispersed. \n\nEven\
  \ though I wanted to talk with them my introvertedness prevented it, but now I got\
  \ a chance.\n\nRani, she introduced herself when I asked for her name. \" Do you\
  \ go to school? \" I inquired, she looked around my age, \" I left school many years\
  \ ago and now I'm waiting for my marriage.\" her excitement was clear in her tone,\
  \ \" What's your age?\" I curiously asked her, she smiled \" fifteen\" and replied.\
  \ I was shocked, being a 13yr old myself at that time, marriage was not even the\
  \ term I was used to, \" How can you marry at fifteen? Why? Don't you wanna study?\"\
  , child marriage in these parts of India has been unnoticed by the government, though\
  \ it's illegal, wrong old traditions and belief have their roots deeply embedded\
  \ couldn't be shaken with just passing a law. \n\nRani smiled but her eyes spoke\
  \ different emotion \" What will I get by studying? My family is poor, my younger\
  \ siblings are studying so I have to earn. If I don't earn then who will look after\
  \ my family. I did study till class four, that's enough. I wanted to study, but\
  \ it's fine.\", my hands went cold on contrary to the temperature, two years elder\
  \ than me and she had burden greater than her years, sacrificing her future and\
  \ the blessing of education for family, still not a single line of frown on her\
  \ forehead. I was standing there telling her it was wrong, she should fight for\
  \ herself, and go back to school. She stood up \" It's fine, thank you.\" & then\
  \ went giggling with her friends."
