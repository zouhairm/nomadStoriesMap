Text: "I had gotten to Porto Novo with my friends and we went looking for Musee Da\
  \ Silva (Da Silva Museum). We came in by the side so we didn't see the main entrance.\
  \ From the road side it looks like the normal storey building you will find in Porto\
  \ Novo,Benin Republic.\n\nWe were greeted by a hall that had a motif of Barrack\
  \ Obama , Martin Luther king's quotes all written out on part of the long walls.\
  \ \n\nFurther inside we saw the statue of the great-grandfather of the owner. It\
  \ was very ironical that for one who was taken away as a slave came back to his\
  \ country later to become a slave trader. You would have thought he would learn\
  \ from the pain and agony he and others went through when they were held as slaves.\n\
  \nThere were different figures made from iron depicting how governance was ran in\
  \ the olden days, as well as photographs of people who changed history.\n\nThere\
  \ was a room that was dedicated to stamps and  old monies from from different African\
  \ countries.\n\nThen the architectural formation of how the family building looks\
  \ like. The Mother's room is next to the daugthers  and is not far from the kitchen\
  \ with its own Veranda. On the end side is teh father's room which is next to the\
  \ son's and then the visitors veranda to receive visitors and chat with friends.\
  \ What was very impressive is the use of cross ventilation for air passage for their\
  \ was no fan nor AC in those days.\n\nWe then walked to another wing of the house\
  \ and there I was totally blown off. The owner had collected typewriters and calculators\
  \ from as far back as the 1920s in one room. There were labels like Olivetti, TA\
  \ contessa 3, Hermes zobo, Underwood 670, Facit, Charles, Olympia, IBM direction,\
  \ and others. \n\nThere was a room dedicated to MKO Abiola, a Nigerian politician\
  \ that  was cheated out of a presidential election,  sent to prison and later died.\
  \ Then a garage with a collection of vintage cars and the evolution of motor cycles.\
  \ The list includes a citreon (1940), Rolls Royce (1970), Citreon (1945), Yamaha,\
  \ Old Kawasaki, Harley Davidson Megaphone by Pionnier, short to say it is a collector's\
  \ paradise.\n\nI love cameras and I saw the history of Cameras from pin hole camera\
  \ to 1st Generation Hasselblad, also were collections of turntables, Betamax and\
  \ VHS  players, Gramophones and the rest. \n\nWe spent two and a half hours in this\
  \ building, I have to say the preservation of history is key. There were things\
  \ i saw pictures of in books but i was able to see them live, the collections are\
  \ impressive."
