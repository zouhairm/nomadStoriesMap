Text: "We rang the doorbell on the 3-storey building in Knysna. No one answered. \n\
  \u201CMaybe she\u2019s out leading a tour. Let\u2019s come back later\u201D, our\
  \ friend and tour guide Eugene explained. \nThe previous day he suggested we visited\
  \ a local artist and tour guide to the townships of Knysna. We went in between a\
  \ hike and a leisurely walk through the picturesque town on the Garden Route in\
  \ South Africa. \nWhen we returned, Peggy was back from her tour. She opened the\
  \ door with the hugest smile we have ever seen. Not with a handshake but with a\
  \ warm hug she greeted us. \nThe small studio was crammed with her paintings. Beautiful,\
  \ vibrant scenes of the African (wild) life covered every inch of the walls, overlapped,\
  \ and peeked shyly from behind each other. \nTeaching youngsters to paint and express\
  \ themselves through art, instead of putting their energy into doing mischiefs,\
  \ has been her mission for the past few years. Then she started working with women\
  \ from the townships. They had no previous education but needed a way to express\
  \ themselves and break the everyday cycle of unemployment and work around the house.\
  \ \nThe women put their emotions and energy into crafting unique souvenirs and simple\
  \ jewellery or sewing typical African clothing, designed by Peggy. The work improved\
  \ their confidence and earned them a small income and the respect of their community.\
  \ \nPeggy\u2019s passion for her work and her mission was extraordinary and contagious.\
  \ Everything she did, she did with a beaming smile. We could sense her deep understanding\
  \ and care for the needs of others by the intensity with which she shared her stories\
  \ with us. \nTime with Peggy passed unnoticed. Before we left, we chose a colourful\
  \ painting of a Venda village surrounded by baobab trees to remind us of the incredible\
  \ woman we had just met. \nA few months later, we were saddened to learn about the\
  \ fires in Knysna and the region. Families lost their homes and whole neighbourhoods\
  \ were wiped out by the disaster. \nPeggy was actively aiding others, gathering\
  \ donations, and coordinating helpers. Ignoring her own weak health, she did a tremendous\
  \ job towards rebuilding Knysna. Her work is far from done but the smile slowly\
  \ returns to her face. \nShe continues to guide tourists through the townships of\
  \ Knysna, telling the stories of the people living there. Hopefully, one day we\
  \ would return for a tour in her hometown and witness the gigantic difference a\
  \ caring person with a huge smile and endless passion can make!"
