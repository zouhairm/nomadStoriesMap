Text: "My nostrils are hit by a mixed smell of light body sweat and fruity perfumes,\
  \ my eyes are drawn to the puzzled mosaics of brightly coloured ceramic jewels adorning\
  \ the walls. The Sun is radiating through dusty stained glass windows, showcasing\
  \ the green hanging plants stationed haphazardly around the room.\n\nThe Latin Caribbean\
  \ music of the Rueda de Casino, the Cuban Salsa is loud and joyful, the jubilant\
  \ energy fills me at once. I stand for a moment soaking in the atmosphere Le Casa\
  \ Del Son Salsa School, Havana, Cuba.\n\nThe grand, fingerprint smudged mirror fills\
  \ the wall in front of us. Tajo introduces himself in perfect English, his jet-black\
  \ ink coloured hair is swept backward from his forehead and his chiseled face looks\
  \ as though it was carved from El Cristo de La Habana itself.\n\nWith my experience,\
  \ we start to dance together fluidly, I can hear him counting as I step 1, 2, 3,\
  \ pause, 5, 6, 7 pause.\n\nTajo sings to the background music of La Vida Es Un Carnaval\
  \ by Celia Cruz. His voice is beautiful. Full of Bass, low and in tune. We move\
  \ together well, soaking in each other\u2019s energy, our arms entwine and I am\
  \ glistening with sweat.\n\nClose by, the barman is preparing a Mojito. The Salsa\
  \ teachers are enthusiastically arguing about something in Spanish and a small kitten\
  \ comes running through our legs. Around me is chaos and I am on such a high.\n\n\
  As we dance, I am staring into his rich chocolate eyes and I am completely captured\
  \ in the moment. These soft eyes are burrowing into my soul, I am shy so I giggle\
  \ and attempt to pull away. He pulls me closer and I snap my head back feigning\
  \ confidence, he pulls a cheeky half-smile and I feel intimidated and vulnerable.\n\
  \nHis smile widens and his pearly white teeth escape his rose-red wine lips and\
  \ asks \u2018are you shy?\u2019\n\nA new song plays and we start the routine again,\
  \ we never break eye contact, the feeling is so intense as we push closer, we come\
  \ to a stop at the same time the song finishes. \n\nWe stare at each other with\
  \ want and he breaks away with a sorrow in his eyes and says \u2018thank you Rebbecca,\
  \ I have had a lovely time.\u2019\nThe moment is broken.\n \nI struggle to push\
  \ open the large heavy wooden door and step out on the sweltering street of Empedrado\n\
  \nI inhale a deep breath and let it out as my eyes adjust and all but the sweat\
  \ on my skin of Le Casa Del Son drains from my body. \n\nI walk away without looking\
  \ back. Konwing I will never see him, or experience, such an intense moment again."
