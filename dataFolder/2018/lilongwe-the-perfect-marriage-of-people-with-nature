Text: "Malawi. Who can actually indicate where this small country of 18.1 million\
  \ inhabitants is located? Looking for a small slice of land bordering with Zambia\
  \ to the west, Tanzania to the north and Mozambique to the south, someone will find\
  \ a great lake, and a state little known to most. Far from the usual all-inclusive\
  \ holidays in Africa, Malawi rarely reaches the headlines of international media,\
  \ and when it does it is mainly for celebrities\u2019 adoptions. I was privileged\
  \ with the opportunity to work there for over 18 months and to experience firsthand\
  \ the unique life of this African country.\nI will never forget my first ride from\
  \ the airport to my new home, in the capital Lilongwe. Like a sponge, I was absorbing\
  \ the images around me, the sounds, and the magical energy emitted by the place;\
  \ the endless nature and the vast valleys, sometimes green and sometimes brown,\
  \ and the few dispersed poor houses, barely distinguishable from the earth. I could\
  \ see people everywhere, gathered in large groups, some of them just playing bao\
  \ - a game of balls, something like our own backgammon - or exchanging their products.\
  \ Others were carrying with an incredible grace every sort of objects on the top\
  \ of their head, while walking along the street.\nAbove all, however, I will never\
  \ forget those fancy, colourful fabrics, the word famous chitenges, used to carry\
  \ children on the back or worn as a skirt. Everywhere around me, I was seeing a\
  \ perpetual motion, but also a monadic calm in every facet of daily life. A virtue\
  \ unprecedented for a western who is measuring time in every activity.\nAt one point,\
  \ my escort informed me that we had arrived at my house in Lilongwe. I looked around,\
  \ but the setting had not changed at all. There was no trace of urban environment;\
  \ trees, streams and green valleys were stretching ahead of me, as far as the eye\
  \ could see. The only slight indication that we had just entered into something\
  \ you could call, with a lot of imagination, a city was the density of people and\
  \ the number of houses. Nothing else.\nYet, it took me three days to realize that\
  \ in fact I was living ten minutes away from the capital\u2019s centre. Lilongwe\
  \ has something unique: its inhabitants, about one and a half million, are living\
  \ literally inside the green. It is the perfect \"marriage\" of people with nature.\
  \  Regardless of your financial situation, in Malawi, you really feel that nature\
  \ is the great hostess and humans are simply the guests, along with the rest of\
  \ the animal kingdom."
