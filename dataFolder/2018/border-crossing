Text: "Daaaaa-nun, daaaaaa-nun\u2026 \nThe Jaws theme tune blasts into the cabin of\
  \ the speedboat. I\u2019m sure they play this every crossing. The crewman had worn\
  \ a maniacal smile as he pressed the play button. So the tinny sound of screaming\
  \ teenagers and crunching metal accompanies us as we race across the deep, dark\
  \ waters in the fading light.\nWe have just left the port town of Chetumal, Mexico.\
  \ The fear still lingers in my mind. A small group of travellers on a jetty waited\
  \ to board a boat. We were lined up in single file, backpacks laid out in front\
  \ of each set of flip-flops. Our guards wore dark-green head-to-toe, with a large\
  \ badge across the heart declaring BORDER CONTROL. They carried guns. Big guns.\
  \ Not the type you pointed at someone in warning, but the kind that are used to\
  \ chop down crowds. Sniffer dogs strained against choker collars, eager to reveal\
  \ any amongst us who had dared to dabble in contraband.  \nA curt nod from the commander\
  \ and we were released from our interrogation. Scrambling as one onto the boat that\
  \ would take us across the border to a new land of unknown. \nThe roar of the speedboat\
  \ quiets down to a whine. In the distance, only a couple of bright spotlights illuminate\
  \ the wharf. Just an old-looking tin shed stands at the end of the jetty beside\
  \ which we pull up. It all seems so casual, not the usual administrative formality\
  \ of entering into a new country. It makes me nervous. \nWe all disembark onto the\
  \ rickety pier and move shufflingly towards the metal shack.\nInside, a number of\
  \ laminex tables are assembled. Behind each one sits a man or woman in short-sleeved\
  \ blue shirts. Our backpacks are proffered at the entrance, and taken away. Anxiety\
  \ gnaws at me. This is not what a normal border crossing looks like. My mind flickers\
  \ briefly to horror stories of missing travellers, sold off for body parts. I am\
  \ waved towards the next available table. \n\u2018Have ya eva been t\u2019 Belize\
  \ before?\u2019 Asks a middle-aged woman with piercingly-serious, black eyes and\
  \ hair slicked back into a tight bun.\n\u2018No, no\u2026 my first time.\u2019 I\
  \ attempt a nervous smile.\n\u2018Well, welcome t\u2019 Belize!\u2019 Her face splits\
  \ into a glorious, beaming smile, as she thunks a stamp down onto my passport.\n\
  Outside, as we slump into our relief, a large man rides slowly towards us on a pushbike.\
  \ He hums along happily to distant reggae music. As he passes us he smiles and gives\
  \ us a lazy wave. I catch glimpse of the badge on the arm of his short-sleeved blue\
  \ shirt. \nBORDER CONTROL, it reads."
