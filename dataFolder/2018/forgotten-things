Text: "It was a sunny August afternoon, we were immersing our feet into cold, sun-drenched\
  \ mountain river\u2019s water. I\u2019ve glanced for a moment to formidable mountains\
  \ surrounding us all around: \u201CAbkhazia, how can you be that glorious and so\
  \ neglected?\u201D came up in my mind.\nWe had encountered Murat in town of Tkwarchal\
  \ a day before, it brought my friends and me to overnight stay with ordinary Abkhazian\u2019\
  s family.  \nTechnically, Abkhazia is unrecognized republic by most of the countries\
  \ and referred to in comprise of Georgia. My friends and me had been traveling across\
  \ Ukraine and Russia for a while when we decided to see how people live in place\
  \ which considered to be independent republic only by 4 UN members. \nWhen we have\
  \ reached abandoned Tkwarchal, which used to be famous for its reserves of coal,\
  \ a swarthy, brown-eyed man in his 50s was thrilled to guide us around and show\
  \ hidden in rocks spring mineral water.\nAfter Abkhazian war, Tkwarchal is no more\
  \ a town of prosperity. However, it still has its residents, those who survived\
  \ and didn\u2019t leave the town. Murat is one of those. \nThe news had quickly\
  \ transferred around neighborhood, and soon Murat\u2019s neighbors, had joined us\
  \ in our journey. We had a dinner all together, listened to each other\u2019s dreams\
  \ and beliefs. I haven\u2019t seen that kind of appreciation for simple listening\
  \ for a long time. \nAlmost everything they have is growing in their backyards and\
  \ made by themselves: \u201CThat\u2019s how we live. Everything should be done by\
  \ yourself, in other words, there is no other way\u201D told Murat.\n\u201CThe grapes..grapes,\
  \ that what I love. The more grapes you have, the more wine it\u2019ll be. One sip\
  \ you try, and you'll lose your mind\u201D narrated Roman, neighbor of Murat, with\
  \ a smile full of excitement under his big fair mustache.\nThe day after, we've\
  \ enjoyed the sun and colorful turquoise river's water, we were saying our gratitude\
  \ and goodbye to Murat\u2019s family. Murat\u2019s eyes filled up with a smile,\
  \ and he replied: \u201CYou are my guests. We have to share with each other. Here,\
  \ we don\u2019t like greedy people, we don\u2019t understand that. We are here to\
  \ help each other. If you need something don\u2019t be shy to ask for it. Now, have\
  \ a safe trip and we\u2019ll wait for you next year!\u201D\nWe\u2019ve left with\
  \ gratefulness for what we experienced. It maintained appreciation for every moment\
  \ and to our neighbors. As Abkhazian proverb goes, \u201CThe good neighbor is better\
  \ than distant relative\u201D.  Whole Abkhazia remined that everything can change,\
  \ and we'd better be together."
