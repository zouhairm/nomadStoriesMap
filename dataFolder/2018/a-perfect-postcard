Text: "I had imagined that moment as a conquest, and now? Exhausted, I was begging\
  \ Jordi to leave me there.\nHe had found us a lift from Quilotoa and now we were\
  \ on the Cotopaxi, the highest active volcano in the world.\nIts image is the perfect\
  \ postcard: the majestic cone dominating the scene and a llama chewing placidly\
  \ in the foreground. The classic tourist destination you saw many times in magazines.\n\
  \nAs soon as we left the parking, I understood it would be hard. I had no preparation\
  \ and I had embarked on the trip impulsively. Our friends started to climb at brisk\
  \ pace, but I was already suffering from lack of oxygen.\nJordi was too kind to\
  \ leave me behind: he was born in Quito and could easily run at that altitude, but\
  \ he walked with me.\nMy lungs shrank more and more at every step and the fatigue\
  \ wasn\u2019t paying off: the clouds wrapped the Coto, as Jordi called it, like\
  \ an Andean shawl, and I started to think it was all a waste of time. \u201CContinue\
  \ without me\u201D I said. My plan was to sit on a rock and wait for my friends\
  \ to come back.\n\n- You cannot stay here.\n- Yes, I can!\n- I\u2019ll carry your\
  \ bag.\n- Don\u2019t worry.\n- I know you\u2019re independent, but I want to help.\n\
  - I appreciate it, but no, thanks.\n- I will carry you on my shoulders.\n- What?\
  \ No!\n\nNow I was upset: Jordi was so kind that didn\u2019t realise when he was\
  \ inappropriate.\n\u201CWe will walk slowly and stop whenever you need to\u201D\
  , he continued. I felt ashamed for being annoyed at his offer of help. He didn\u2019\
  t wait for me to accept, he just took my hand and walked.\n\u201CDo you know the\
  \ legend of the Coto?\u201D, he asked in quite\xF1o Spanish. \u201CThe Coto was\
  \ a warrior. He was in love with Tungurahua, but so was Chimborazo. The two volcanos\
  \ battled and then\u2026 Oh! Look!\u201D.\n\nWe had reached the refuge and the clouds\
  \ spread out, unwrapping the peak like cotton candy pulled by mischievous hands.\n\
  There it was: the magnificent snow-capped cone. The red earth under the perennial\
  \ snow and the blue sky above created an astonishing contrast: the landscape was\
  \ lunar, and time stopped.\nBare, rough, I could almost hear the volcano roar.\n\
  \u201CThe sky is greeting you\u201D, Jordi declared. I burst into tears. \u201C\
  Is everything OK?\u201D, he asked. \u201CIt's perfect\u201D, I replied.\nI didn\u2019\
  t reach the top, but I learnt to appreciate every step I make towards my successes,\
  \ and failures, and those who walk at my side during the hard times. I\u2019m not\
  \ here to conquer anything else but my fears.\n\nI close the book of Ecuadorian\
  \ legends Jordi gave me when I left, I can almost hear his voice."
