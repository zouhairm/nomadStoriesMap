Text: "\u201CWe are now entering the airspace of Islamic Republic of Iran. Per laws\
  \ of the country, all women must cover their hair with a headscarf\u2026\u201D Anything\
  \ else the accented pilot said was lost on me, as I reached into my bag for a scarf\
  \ to cover mine. \n\nHow would a non-Muslim Asian woman traveling alone in a predominantly\
  \ conservative Muslim country be received? Would I be able to meet locals and engage\
  \ with them outside of asking for prices on things? I felt a moment of uncertainty\
  \ as these questions swirled in my mind, while the airplane touched down in Tehran.\n\
  \nEach day that passed erased any uncertainties I had. I met many wonderful locals\
  \ and experienced their generosity and kindness. I once asked for directions in\
  \ the streets of Isfahan, mistakenly from one who didn\u2019t understand English,\
  \ a lady overheard it and escorted me to the right destination despite originally\
  \ heading to the opposite direction. Then there was the time I was sitting on a\
  \ bus for a 5-hour trip to Yazd when seemingly out of nowhere, the conductor handed\
  \ me a saffron-flavored soft-serve ice cream cone, which he also bought for himself\
  \ and the driver, and asked me in broken English if I liked his country and what\
  \ cities I\u2019ve visited. You\u2019d be hard-pressed to find that interaction\
  \ in the streets of New York.\n\nI have always wondered what I would do if I get\
  \ invited into a stranger\u2019s home. Now, I don\u2019t have to. For when faced\
  \ with such an invite, I trusted the universe and humanity, and graciously accepted.\n\
  \nI met Mohammad and his wife Shema at their home in Tehran one night, and proceeded\
  \ to exchange delightful stories of family, travel and our respective countries\
  \ between tea and delicious dinner. We laughed at my adventures in Queshm Island\
  \ where I ended up inadvertently joining a Farsi-led tour group and not understanding\
  \ any information but having a fun time regardless. They talked about their taxation,\
  \ healthcare and retirement systems, while I contrasted theirs with New York\u2019\
  s and United States\u2019. It was a unforgettable night, Persian hospitality at\
  \ its finest. We met each other as strangers and walked away as friends. \n\nConnecting\
  \ with locals is one of the essence of traveling. At least in my book. It is to\
  \ understand another\u2019s perspective, to see their city through their eyes, to\
  \ have them see theirs through yours, and to take them to places you\u2019ve been\
  \ through the stories you share. I\u2019ve accomplished this, and more, on this\
  \ trip. \n\nAnd now, I\u2019m off to my next destination."
