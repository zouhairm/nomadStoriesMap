Text: "Red coral, like Rose quartz is a symbol of love and healing. \n\nI run from\
  \ port to starboard, unable to hide my joy at the sight that lay before me. The\
  \ turquoise waters that envelop the island of Vaka Eitu, its palm trees that wave\
  \ from golden sand shores. The warm September air that lends itself to feelings\
  \ of surrealism. \n\nI\u2019d be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t at least a little\
  \ afraid of the ocean. Despite hailing from a city by the sea and growing up surrounded\
  \ by salt and sand, it were a fear I\u2019d held for a long time. And yet, I found\
  \ myself in Tonga, days away from helping sail a 45ft yacht to New Zealand. \n\n\
  Determined to face my fears, I breath deep and jump, letting the South Pacific embrace\
  \ me as salt cleansea my sun-kissed skin. I contort my body below the water, feeling\
  \ mermadic as I follow neon fish through coral banks and towards the shore. \n\n\
  Notes of frangipani encapsulate me as my feet dig into warm sand and my eye is instantly\
  \ caught by a lone grave atop a nearby hill. Beating rhythym to a rogue coconut\
  \ shell, I scramble barefoot past wild cava and taro crops, marvelling at the crimson\
  \ ants whose path I share.\n\nThe grave is unmarked, but well loved with fresh frangipanis\
  \ laid across it. A small matchbox calls to me and I shake the remaining water from\
  \ my hands to strike the last match, watching it slowly burn. Considering whose\
  \ island this is, how I came to be here and the fears I am leaving behind. The sun\
  \ begins to dry her brushes across the night sky and I realise that island time\
  \ is a very real thing; I can\u2019't be sure how long I've been gone for when I\
  \ climb aboard the boat. \n\nKarl is in the throes of conversation and stops when\
  \ he sees my head peek over. \n\n\u201CThis is Davito, Vaka Eitu is his island\u201D\
  \ he offers, as I embrace a kind-faced Tongan man surrounded by clouds of cigarette\
  \ smoke, \u201CAnna plays the ukulele\u201D. This news sees Davito light up, insisting\
  \ I join his evening feast. \n\nFires are lit and cava poured as we sing and dance\
  \ to the notes from my yellow ukulele. The ocean watches on, moonlight reflecting\
  \ from her surface. \n\nI'd long kept a rose quartz close to my heart. Upon starting\
  \ my travels, it had been gifted, \u201Cfor your heart\u201D. Several coconut shells\
  \ of cava later and I realise I'd lost it when I'd jumped into the ocean. \n\nDavid\
  \ laughs at my predicament. \n\n\u201CAnna, don't you see, your heart belongs to\
  \ the ocean now\u201D \n\nThe next morning, I find the red coral he'd snuck into\
  \ my ukulele. We sailed further away and I realised it always had."
