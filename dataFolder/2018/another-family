Text: "<<Welcome in Tan\xE0. Do you want some Whiskey?>>. \nI couldn't believe I really\
  \ went. \n\n\"I'm a little Italian girl, I've always lived in the peace of a beautiful\
  \ family, but when I was 15 I was sad. I had everything I wanted, but I felt there\
  \ was something wrong.\"\n\n<<Have a good night>>, told us Sandra, the houskeeper,\
  \ <<Don't be afraid by mosquitoes: you're in safe, here>>. \nI sleeped many hours,\
  \ like I was in my confortably bed at home, until the light of the morning woke\
  \ me up. \n\n\"Some years later, when  i was 19, I got a little job, I earned a\
  \ little of money and I listened to my old instinct: I ought to have a look of the\
  \ life, of what I considered the real life, out of my comfort zone. I wanted to\
  \ see poor chindens' eyes. I tought our life was too easy, in comparison to theirs.\
  \ And I wanted to understand too many things of yhe world. It was like an imperative:\
  \ GO. So I chose an association, a country (Madagascar), and the games were made.\
  \ No one though I could face an experience like that.  I didn't even.\" \n\nThe\
  \ first morning, my travel mate (I did not know them before) and me met the first\
  \ malagasy people: with their honey color skin, their big smiles, their happy eyes.\
  \ It was a positive first impact, but we couldn't expect what would happened in\
  \ the following weeks. \nThey explained us the program of our stay there: activities\
  \ with children, help in the school cantine kitchen, trips in the poorest quartiers\
  \ of Antananarivo. Very good, I thought, it seems to be challenging but feasible.\
  \ \nActually we didn't \"work\" every our in the day. My mate and me could also\
  \ take relax, we smooked cigarettes all nights listening to malagasy stories, and\
  \ no one felt the lack of lap or Tv. Nothing. \n\nThe days start very early, in\
  \ Madagascar, and at 17 pm everyone is going back home. Houses are huts, the roads\
  \ impassable, the water of the river is brown, people push carts along the streets,\
  \ childern run around playng with the stones. Time seems never to pass. \nDiametrically\
  \ different from all I was used to. Another world, that smalled of ancient, of mango\
  \ ..and of love. \nYes, the love, the biggest love I felt there: the children. With\
  \ their joy of living! \n\nSo, I can say it was the travel of my heart, the best\
  \ experience I never had. And expecially, my journey in Africa was the last thing\
  \ I expected: another comfort zone. Another family.  Happy children laughing even\
  \ though they have nothing. \nAnother sky to what people like me pray every night.\
  \ What a beautiful life."
