Text: "In February of 2017, I traveled to Mexico with my girlfriend to visit her family.\
  \ We decided to explore what the area had to offer and hit the road. We hiked Pe\xF1\
  a de Bernal, explored the shops of San Miguel Allende, and admired the aqueducts\
  \ Arcos del Sitio. This was a wonderful time of exploration with my girlfriend,\
  \ and during this time I got to know her aunts, her cousins, and her grandmother\
  \ (Abuelita in Spanish).\n\nWhile at the aqueducts, we took a long walk around the\
  \ hills. These were steep slopes with suspension bridges in between and Abuelita,\
  \ who was 83 at the time, kept up the entire way. This woman had determination!\
  \ We finally got to a low point in the walk and came to a creek. We started to cross,\
  \ but as Abuelita started making her way to the water, she was promptly told to\
  \ go around the long way with my girlfriend's mother. Yeah, she didn't listen. I\
  \ had just made it to the other side of the creek myself when I saw Abuelita stepping\
  \ out on to the rocks. I quickly made my way back to her to help her over the rocks.\
  \ We were most of the way through when her foot slipped on one of the rocks and\
  \ she started to fall.  I had ahold of her hand and had to make a snap decision.\
  \ Do I lunge at this 83 year old woman and grab her before she falls? Do I let her\
  \ fall but keep holding her hand to make it more gentle? Do I dive underneath her\
  \ falling body as a crash pad? I was afraid of hurting her any worse and opted for\
  \ letting her down gently. There we were in the middle of a creek, Abuelita laying\
  \ in it, me standing over top of her, and my girlfriend looking on in absolute horror.\
  \ My life was over. I could not possibly mess up worse than this when trying to\
  \ endear myself to the potential in-laws. The only sounds I could hear were the\
  \ babbling of the water and laughing...from Abuelita herself. She had some scrapes\
  \ on her ankle from the initial slip and bruised pride, but she was ok. I helped\
  \ her back to her feet and we were able to continue on our way. I was apologizing\
  \ profusely to say the least, but once she regained her composure, this was a story\
  \ for Abuelita to tell and tell it she did...to everyone...the whole trip.\n\nI\
  \ had to take the laughter, but that little incident actually endeared me to Abuelita\
  \ as we continued our journeys through the breathtaking vistas of central Mexico.\
  \ She is still asking when I'm coming back to visit. It is only when on adventures\
  \ that these strange scenarios seem to come up. They definitely give us a story\
  \ to tell."
