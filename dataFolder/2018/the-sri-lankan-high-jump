Text: "Sri Lankans jump differently from westerners. I was surprised to see this,\
  \ as I stood at the edge of a school field just outside Tissamaharama, observing\
  \ a high jump competition. I was watching boys\u2019 competition, an excited, incautious\
  \ procession of leapers racing down a funnel of their cheering classmates with one\
  \ goal in mind.\nIt is a goal I am well familiar with. Throughout my school years\
  \ I raced track competitively, and it was by discussing this, over a bottle of Sri\
  \ Lankan arak with the P.E. teacher friend of my guesthouse owner, that I was invited\
  \ to the local school the next day to experience a Sri Lankan field meet (the school\
  \ not having a track, no racing events were held). Introduced to the scene the next\
  \ day, I was left to peruse the events being held, and was swiftly drawn to the\
  \ spectacle of the Sri Lankan high jump.\nOne after another, the boys would sprint,\
  \ straight as an arrow, towards the bar. This they would try to clear head on, by\
  \ hurdling in various forms. One jumper might lead with one leg over the bar; another\
  \ would use both, in a form more reminiscent of long jump. Others would twist, almost\
  \ falling over the bar sideways. And one after another, without fail, would fly\
  \ on to the protective pads set behind the bar, and then crash onto the ground beyond\
  \ those.\nHere is where I started to notice the similarities between these young\
  \ athletes and those of the competitions of my youth. They would get up and look\
  \ towards the bar. On their countenance only two emotions showed: either joy at\
  \ having cleared their objective, or disappointment at their failure. I had been\
  \ focused on the dissimilarities between these local students and my school days,\
  \ and had overlooked our principle sameness. These are the exact emotions of every\
  \ competitor everywhere, regardless of the event, or how they choose to carry out\
  \ the event.\nI walked around the field some more, and watched as long jump winners\
  \ embraced each other, shot putters consulted their coaches, and children cheered\
  \ their classmates on. Though tinged by the chaos of groups of students walking\
  \ straight through events, and impromptu cricket matches sending balls flying through\
  \ the discus circle, this field meet was something I understood and sorely missed.\
  \ Now when I think fondly back on the meets I\u2019ve experienced, I\u2019ll have\
  \ one more memory to focus on: the local meet in Tissamaharama, Sri Lanka, where\
  \ I learned that though the ways we jump are different, the reasons we jump are\
  \ all the same."
