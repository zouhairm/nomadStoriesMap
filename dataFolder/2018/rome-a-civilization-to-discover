Text: "At last, my travel to one of the civilizations which contributed so much to\
  \ humanity. I had been forward to it for a long time, but for one thing or another\
  \ \nI couldn't make it come true.\nI had imagined so many experiences to live and\
  \ tell once there. I had watched documentaries, read travel magazines and heard\
  \ travellers opinions but\nI had never to have such a conncection with the city,\
  \ it exceeded my expectations. When I arrived at the airport the only thing that\
  \ was crossings my \nmind at that moment was that I could'nt believe that I was\
  \ walking on the Emperors' Land. Everything was new, different, refreshing and unique.\
  \ I got on \nthe train to the emperial city, Rome. Then I got on the metro, it was\
  \ there where I noticed all the tourists from different countries who wished a great\
  \ \nwelcome from the city like me. This unknown scene of the city in front  of me\
  \ just made me feel excited to find, search and discover every little detail and\n\
  curiosity in the city beyond the rush of the moment. Rome told me in detail its\
  \ history as well as its religion, for example, the Vatican the smallest country\
  \ \nin the world, just fabulous\xA1  I was amazed by the parishoners faith and adoration\
  \ who come on a pilgrimage to this place. Here you can admire St. Peter's\nSquare,\
  \ also you can visit the Vatican Museums you can see Swiss guards and so on ...\n\
  0n the other side of the city of Rome I explored its archeology, gastronomy, people,\
  \ traffic and stress. I was trasnported through time by the tourist guide's explanations\
  \ in the Coliseum, The Roman Forum or the Pantheon. The experience would have never\
  \ been possible without the kindness of \nRoman's who helped me and gave me directions\
  \ during my stay in their city. At the end of my travel I felt conforted and satisfied,\
  \ these good memories \nwill be with me the rest of my life. \nWhen I was back on\
  \ the plane, I could see through the window a full moon. I felt this was a farewell\
  \ and gratitude for my visit to the Emperors' Land\nat that moment I promised myself\
  \ to come back to the city which had changed my story."
