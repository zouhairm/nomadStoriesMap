Text: "I was 19 years old when I decided that I needed to make a trip on my own and\
  \ it turned out to be the best decision I've ever made. Taking little hikes by myself,\
  \ hitchhiking to a volcano, meeting new people and treating them like they were\
  \ long lost friends: it felt like the little pieces of my personal puzzle started\
  \ to fall together one by one. One of those particular puzzle pieces found me in\
  \ the warm waters of the Blue Lagoon. The Blue Lagoon: a must-see when visiting\
  \ Iceland, at least so I was told. With pain in my wallet I had set myself up to\
  \ step right into the tourist trap, but luckily, all they said turned out to be\
  \ true. The blue lagoon was an absolute stunner. Even now, just closing my eyes\
  \ can bring me back to the pearly blue white waters, the salty smell and the hot\
  \ steam, laying on the water as a thick grey blanket. It was the scary voice that\
  \ I heard that day that I will truly never forget, however. ''G\xF3\xF0an daginn''\
  \ It was the weirdest, shreekiest voice I had ever heard. It was almost as if a\
  \ robotic creature stood behind me, yet when I looked over my shoulder it was just\
  \ an old man, smiling back at me, saying: ''It's Icelandic for Good Day''. The airless,\
  \ harsh way in which the words seemed to disappear from his mouth when he spoke\
  \  put me off for a little bit at first, but as our conversation continued, I got\
  \ hooked on his story. A true traveller he was. At 96 years old, he had spent more\
  \ than half of his life abroad: first as a soldier, later flying for a commercial\
  \ airline. During his time as a soldier, he would be part of something that the\
  \ Icelanders call 'The Situation'. It was a period in which all Icelandic women\
  \ would be conquered by American soldiers, only to be left alone pregnant a few\
  \ months after. He proved to be the happy exception. He married her and travelled\
  \ the world with her until the day she died. Even now, 8 years after she passed\
  \ away, with throat cancer and 96 years to his name, he made it out to Iceland every\
  \ two years to greet her at the little rose garden he planted for her in Akureyri,\
  \ her birthplace. But it wasn't just his lovestory that makes me remember him to\
  \ this day. It was the ageless, fearless spark in his words that set off a fire\
  \ in me that since then never burned out. It was the way he said that if he died,\
  \ his body would probably be found in some Tiger's faeces in Laos. It was the way\
  \ with which he reminded me that you hold the pen to your own story, so you can\
  \ make it as epic as you want."
