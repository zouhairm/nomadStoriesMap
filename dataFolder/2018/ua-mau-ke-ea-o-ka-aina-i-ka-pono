Text: "Hawai\u2019i is one of the most enchanting and one of the top travel destinations\
  \ on the entire globe, but what people are unaware of is how and why it has reached\
  \ this status. Hawaiians are known to have a deep spiritual connection to this earth\
  \ and as a result, I believe that is why Hawai'i is so beautiful because it\u2019\
  s people genuinely care about the land and strive to maintain its well-being. When\
  \ you grasp the land, you learn its culture and when you understand the culture,\
  \ you will learn where you stand on the Aina (land) and how to become an enhancement\
  \ or an outsider. There is a lot of hurt throughout the islands because of the unwanted\
  \ company who have left permanent scars on the people of Hawai'i. Deeply embedded\
  \ underneath the surface of Honolulu\u2019s buzzing tourist industry, lies a solid\
  \ truth which is the way of life that every Hawaiian lives by, \u201DUa mau ke ea\
  \ o ka 'aina i ka pono\u201D (the life of the land is perpetuated in righteousness).\
  \ One of the deepest local connections I have made while living in the islands was\
  \ working in the Lo'i patch. A Lo\u2019i patch is a freshwater system that has existed\
  \ for hundreds of years and is used to plant and grow taro. Poi is made from the\
  \ taro and it is a Hawaiian staple. It is very important and a vital source of the\
  \ culture, spirituality, and sustenance. A group of friends and I were invited to\
  \ work in our friend \"Iwa\u2019s\" family Lo\u2019i patch. If you look at the Lo\u2019\
  i patch from a birds-eye view there are different sections that are separated off\
  \ in long rectangular shaped barriers. Each rectangular shape is a patch filled\
  \ with fresh spring water which normally flows from the mountains. What\u2019s beautiful\
  \ about working in Iwa\u2019s Lo\u2019i, was that all of her family members were\
  \ there. It was a monthly ritual. I did my best to clear as many weeds off along\
  \ the walls and barriers and in between the Kalo leaves. While enjoying the laughs\
  \ and the company of others, I felt satisfaction knowing that what we were doing\
  \ came from the bottom of our hearts and looking back at the Lo'i, it was cleared\
  \ and the Kalo could breathe and generate an amazing amount of taro for the Aina\
  \ and for its people. This local connection isn\u2019t only local, it is eternal\
  \ and I am overwhelmed with honor, and love for the land and everyone who has the\
  \ opportunity to take a dip in the cooling mud and clear out the Lo'i. It will forever\
  \ create an imprint on the heart, mind, and spirit as you learn to love the land\
  \ and return let it love and take care of you."
