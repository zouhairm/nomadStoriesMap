Text: "\u201CYou\u2019re going WHERE?\u201D \nI heard that question many times before\
  \ departing. No one understood why this Central American girl wanted to spend the\
  \ holidays 5000 miles away from home. \nWhen I landed in Reykjavik, I was greeted\
  \ by a soothing silence and complete villages covered in Christmas lights. From\
  \ climbing glaciers to snorkeling in 35\xBAF waters, the next few days passed and\
  \ I was so physically challenged, evenings consisted in a quick meditation before\
  \ going to sleep. This meditation often gravitated to loneliness, and I was scared.\n\
  After dinner one evening, I came back to my hostel room, shared with other fifteen\
  \ people and met two Puerto Rican girls had just been assigned to the bunk bed next\
  \ to mine. Puerto Rico is 1500 miles from home, but still, speaking Spanish and\
  \ laughing about some cultural ties between the girls and I was refreshing.\nWe\
  \ spent the next few days together, driving here and there to see the breathtaking\
  \ beauty of the island. I felt each time more comfortable and slowly forgot the\
  \ solitude.\nWe were also enthusiastic about Reykjavik night life. On our first\
  \ night out, we entered a bar named Pablo Discobar, appealed by the catchy name\
  \ and the rhythm of music. Inside, the atmosphere felt cold and dull. A few people\
  \ were talking, others were checking their phones, and a couple smoking on the outside\
  \ balcony. \nInstantly, I felt uncomfortable and a rush of anxiety came to me: you\u2019\
  re surrounded by people, but you\u2019re not part of this. I was starting to think\
  \ of an excuse to get back to the comfort of the hostel, when I saw one of the Puerto\
  \ Rican girls approach the DJ and mutter some quick words. \nTen seconds later,\
  \ salsa music filled the room. Every person in the room turned to see her starting\
  \ to dance, loudly singing the lyrics. A minute after that, the whole bar was dancing\
  \ and laughing out loud. Two minutes later, I was dancing too.\nI was feeling tired\
  \ after some long moments of dance, and stopped to look around me. Our little group\
  \ was divided in the dancers and the talkers. A new rush came over me, but this\
  \ time, it was not anxiety. This time, it was bliss. \nThe last thing I expected\
  \ was being in the middle of Reykjavik, dancing salsa, and realizing I had just\
  \ found a new small family, people who had taken part of my heart and soul with\
  \ them in just a few days, while giving a part of theirs."
