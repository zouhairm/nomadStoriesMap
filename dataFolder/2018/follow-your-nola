Text: "(F)irst off, the state of Louisiana was sold off by the French to the United\
  \ States due to the Haitian Revolution.  I would love to give you all the details\
  \ in this article, but I think you should read the history books yourself. In short,\
  \ Haiti won, Napoleon lost and New Orleans benefited from all parties involved.\
  \ (O)pulence would be an understatement term to describe the Crescent City, long\
  \ ago just a muddy swamp, but still under the moonlight sky it sparkled brighter\
  \ than a Ruby.\n(L)ingerie is the essential to pack and shop for in this city of\
  \ romance. Did you know New Orleans is the birth & death place of the 1st African\
  \ American Civil War, Andre Cailloux?\n\n(L)iterature is at its best in this city\
  \ because their books makes you feel you are living the words and not just reading\
  \ them and at Hotel Monteleone, you can spend the night in one of the many city\
  \ famous NOLA author suites.(O)bviously New Orleans is widely known for Mardi Gras\
  \ and Voodou, so in order to get the best experience out of your visit I suggest\
  \ getting the New Orleans Official Guide.(W) hat did I do when I first visited the\
  \ city? I stayed at the Sheraton, went on a tour with the New Orleans Historic Voodoo\
  \ Museum, then met up with NOLA published author Robert Florence, and then visited\
  \ the Old Ursuline Convent. (Not all in the same day).(Y) our bound to get famished\
  \ from all that walking and touring, so I suggested not eating at your hotel because\
  \ it is going to be more expensive than my college loan debt, but do eat out at\
  \ Popeye\u2019s! I know you can eat at your local fast food chain, but in New Orleans\
  \ they serve alligator, crawfish and other southern dishes you can\u2019t get anywhere\
  \ else. Then wash it all down with a drink they call a Hurricane.(O) ther things\
  \ to do in the city include, taking in a show, make sure you go out and enjoy the\
  \ night life. There is nothing like it on earth. Did you know they use to use red\
  \ brick dust with candles to keep the sidewalk pathway lite back in the old days,\
  \ hint the name Red Light District!(U) nder the spell. Screamin Jay Hawkins, I put\
  \ a spell on you must have been dedicated to New Orleans because even their cemeteries\
  \ stand out. Did you know they bury their dead above ground? Seriously you can go\
  \ on a tour and everything to see for yourself, night and day tours are available.\n\
  (R) est in peace, not for the dead of Nawlin\u2019 as the locals say. You have to\
  \ walk past the infamous LaLaurie house on 1140 Royal street.\nhttp://theurbantwist.com/2015/12/29/follow-your-nola/"
