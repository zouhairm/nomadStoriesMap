Text: "It was the beginning of February and love was already in the air. This season\
  \ of love got me a chance to travel to the land, where the much celebrated love\
  \ story of the patron of Taj Mahal, Shahjahan and his wife Mumtaz had begun. \n\
  The broken bastions, the weathered fort wall, and the striking gate, were the first\
  \ things that drew my attention, as I walked towards the most densely populated\
  \ area of Burhanpur( Madhya Pradesh,India). The almost 8 meter high Darwaza(gate)\
  \ with about a 4 meter high arched opening, with two huge bastions on its either\
  \ side, did seem very inviting. As I started walking along the lanes inside, photographing\
  \ and sketching along, a very different feeling crept in. Be it someone cycling\
  \ past, or a family on Tanga, or someone drying their hair on the veranda; their\
  \ eyes could not miss me. As I sat at a corner, sketching the beauty of the fort\
  \ wall turned part of a house, a man approached to ask what I was up to. I explained\
  \ my purpose which seemed satisfactory enough to him and surprisingly, he started\
  \ talking to me about the place, while calling out to his wife. Without even knowing\
  \ me for a while, he invited me inside his house and offered food. And this was\
  \ just the beginning of the unexpected hospitality that I was to get in the coming\
  \ few days I spent there. I realized that any person curious to know about their\
  \ place, was always welcome to their houses, shops or even religious areas, unbiased.\n\
  \ \nThe narrow lanes which were usually very crowded with people, bikes, tangas\
  \ and autorickshaws, never fell impatient to the cows leisurely walking door to\
  \ door, waiting to be fed, or to that mumma pig with her little piglets, rushing\
  \ to find a safer place. The numerous buildings lining the lanes also showed the\
  \ religious tolerance of the people. An intricately carved wood bracketed porch,\
  \ reminding of the Marathas, could be found right beside a house where one could\
  \ hear the Namaj being recited.  More and more conversations with people, not only\
  \ gave me an insight to the socio-economic and cultural background of the place\
  \ but also got me home food. Special invitations to taste that sweet Darawa or that\
  \ auntie\u2019s homemade Khakra left my taste buds wanting more.\nThe journey of\
  \ Burhanpur,not only left me awed with its layers of history and variety of architecture,\
  \ but also convinced me that love is indeed in its air. I left the place with an\
  \ elongated contact list, delicious food and a heavy heart, like almost leaving\
  \ a family."
