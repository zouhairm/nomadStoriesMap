Text: "Dawn goddess Aurora, also known as Eos, every morning opened the gates of the\
  \ sky to the sun by the east. But Eos forget to tell us, in each of the hundreds\
  \ of cities in the world, the sun goes up and goes down uniquely. And we knew only\
  \ our sun, without knowing other\xB4s sun. Since my childhood my heart\xB4s voice\
  \ forced me to meet with the sun of the world.  I knew it's worth traveling just\
  \ once to witness it. \nI have decided to find Eos, and so, one of my hands had\
  \ weathered dreams the other had flight ticket to Lisbon! No Portuguese, no place\
  \ to stay no work but yes, here I am! I was sitting on my sit at the flight with\
  \ so many worries but no fears and near by me, there was a lady, around her 60\xB4\
  s, sitting with the houseplant on her hand. She suddenly smiled me and started to\
  \ talk about her story, how she built up her life in somewhere, without knowing\
  \ their language, their culture.  I felt myself like I am watching myself in the\
  \ future. She said to me \u201CMy name is Hurriyet, in my language it means `Liberty`,\
  \ no one can prisoner me, no one can change me unless I want it. Find your name\xB4\
  s meaning, it will show you the way.\u201D I still remember her, with her lovely\
  \ houseplant. I promised myself to find the meaning of my name. I knew, Lisbon was\
  \ the first step of my journey. My name is Ela, it means \u201CShe\u201D in Portuguese\
  \ and means \u201Ccolour of honey\u201D in my language. \nLisbon\u2026 Home to me\
  \ home to \u201Csaudade\u201D. Lisbon, called me to heal me but I was without knowing\
  \ that. Lisbon, opened the door and showed me her wounds and her colours. Showed\
  \ me her earthquakes and rEVOLutions and taught me that the rEVOLution hides the\
  \ love in it if I know how to read it.  She took my heart and wash my nightmares\
  \ in her ocean and rivers. And I found my sky in it, I found my sun and my colours.\
  \ My name said to me, find your colour. And my journey is about giving my colours\
  \ to the others. I am colourful! I take my own sky, wherever I go, sky is me. Sky\
  \ is mine. Thank you Eos, thank you Lisbon and of course thank you Hurriyet!  That\
  \ little girl followed her own name and now painting her own sky!"
