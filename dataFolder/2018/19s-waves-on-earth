Text: "My dad and I finally made it to San Mateo del Mar, Oaxaca. It felt like being\
  \ at the edge of the world. Earth had been trembling for a while when we got there.\
  \ The town is very hard to reach and everything was chaotic: we had lost the sense\
  \ of security in our own land. The earthquake had also damaged roads and bridges.\n\
  The whole way up there I imagined I would find a piece of land that had turned itself\
  \ into a valley, devoid of the hills that used to be houses. I was worried, I knew\
  \ that no matter how much food we had in the back of our truck, it was never going\
  \ to be enough: starvation was the real problem once we got used to the movements\
  \ of the earth and there was not much left standing. \nThis place was made of waves:\
  \ more sea than land. The first thing we saw was the cemetery: death and water merged\
  \ into the big marsh that calls itself San Mateo \u201Cof the sea\u201D. It was\
  \ right beside the great pond that crosses the entire village. The most beautiful\
  \ place I had ever seen. The graves seemed to be swimming above the ground, everything\
  \ was submerged in silence, and the sun bathed the still water. Zanates flew above\
  \ me and I wanted to cry. How could I deserve to gaze at so much beauty when so\
  \ many people had lost everything in the past few days?\nWe drove around the village\
  \ to hand out the few supplies we carried with us. Not everything had fallen apart,\
  \ but the sand beneath the constructions had altered the floor of every house. People\
  \ said thank you in Huave, a language that seemed to undulate, although I could\
  \ be lying. My father asked, in Spanish, how come they hadn\u2019t moved to a somewhat\
  \ more solid land, where at least they wouldn\u2019t be threatened by the ocean.\
  \ An old man told us that they couldn\u2019t leave: The sea may rise, and our houses\
  \ may fall, but this is home."
