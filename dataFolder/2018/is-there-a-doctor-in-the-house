Text: "Even after 20 years abroad, life has an unending capacity to surprise you if\
  \ you give it half a chance. A few years back, I had picked up a particularly bad\
  \ case of Delhi belly. Suffering from fever, shakes, and all the bottom-end trouble\
  \ one could ask for, I was making a beeline from the south of India to Hampi to\
  \ meet a friend. Despite my medical misery, I was excited to be heading there \u2013\
  \ it was once the centre of a large and prosperous empire and the 2nd largest city\
  \ in the world, around 1500 CE, before being sacked and all but abandoned. A UNESCO\
  \ World Heritage site that boasts countless temples, ruins, and lush jungle, it\u2019\
  s also situated in an other-worldly landscape of jagged peaks and strange, colourful\
  \ and gravity-defying boulders. After checking into a room a mere 50m from the entrance\
  \ to the main temple complex, I just had time to shower and head up to the roof\
  \ to watch the fiery sunset behind the backdrop of stunning Hindu architecture.\
  \ Buoyed by the magnificent surroundings, I was startled to find the owner of the\
  \ guesthouse, Vishu, tapping me on the shoulder asking if I could help him. \u2018\
  What can I do for you\u2019? I asked, a little perplexed. Apparently, his German\
  \ shepherd had been attacked by a leopard a few nights back, and the garish wound\
  \ was festering. Unable to find or afford a vet, he had somehow found some antibiotics\
  \ and needles and asked if I knew how to give injections. Fortunately, I was trained\
  \ in advanced first aid from my time working on yachts, so I said I could try. After\
  \ examining the poor dog, I could see the infection had progressed rapidly. With\
  \ the light fading and no flashlights around, I sent Vishu off quickly for antiseptic.\
  \ With badly shaking hands, I mixed the antibiotics and the solution, and tried\
  \ frantically to flick the bubbles out of the syringe while I could still see. After\
  \ swabbing the area, I insisted that both he and his employee hold him down. Despite\
  \ claims that he was gentle, he was a big dog in a great deal of pain, and I wasn\u2019\
  t convinced he would take being jabbed with a needle lying down, so to speak. In\
  \ the end, he was brave and never lashed out or barked. After giving him that injection,\
  \ and another the following morning, he started to recover remarkably fast. Vishu\
  \ was over the moon. When I next visited Hampi about a month later, Vishu insisted\
  \ that one of my nights was on the house. Obviously I\u2019m no doctor, but I can\
  \ now happily add \u2018Amateur Veterinarian\u2019 to my CV all thanks to a leopard."
