Text: "I was studying abroad in Finland with some friends from my home college, but\
  \ we had a lot of free time due to most of the homework being take-home projects.\
  \ So, on one of our off-days, we booked a Viking River Cruise day trip to Stockholm.\
  \ Although the trip was only days away, I could not contain my excitement. When\
  \ the day finally arrived, we left the port of Turku and sailed along the Baltic\
  \ Sea. I saw many tiny islands on our journey, which I later found out were the\
  \ \xC5land Islands where people actually reside.\n\nWhen we arrived in Stockholm,\
  \ we wanted to make the day memorable by visiting all the top sights of the city.\
  \ We visited Stockholm Old Town, Kungliga Djurgarden,  Royal Palace and The Nobel\
  \ Museum. The Nobel Museum was definitely a top site for me. We got to experience\
  \ a free guided tour and as a writer, it was fun for me to see many of the awards\
  \ given to our past literary greats and the most interesting of all,  a signed letter\
  \ by Einstein!\n\nWe continued to walk around the streets of Stockholm and we saw\
  \ lots of statues and monuments, Charles XIV John, King Gustav III and the guard\
  \ lions of the Royal Palace. We walk until we're hungry and then we stop into Cafe\
  \ Pascal for a bite to eat and a cup of coffee -- It is affordable and delicious!\
  \ I've learned that Scandinavian cafes and coffee trumps Americas (sorry, not sorry.)\n\
  \nWith our bellies now full, we continue on but notice our time is running short\
  \ so we can only visit one more place.  We choose the Storkyrkan (Stockholm Cathedral,\
  \ or in Swedish means 'The Great Church'.) The Storkyrkan was filled with a history\
  \ and old-world wonders that would definitely invite one's curiosity into digging\
  \ deeper. I stood at the altar in awe of the beauty surrounding me. I look up to\
  \ a statue of Saint George and the Dragon carved from wood and gold angels holding\
  \ a crown strewn above me. I feel protected here and as someone who has never declared\
  \ to be a person of faith, I feel a sense of hope. Before we leave to go back to\
  \ our ship, I take one more look.\n\n\nAfter a day spent in Stockholm, I wish I\
  \ had more time to explore. We missed out on the ABBA museum, but we did get to\
  \ see a lot of things that were inspiring to us. I took back a sense of gratitude\
  \ and learned how to see things as they once were and how far we have come since\
  \ the days of Einstein of Saint George. Maybe one day I will get the chance to revisit,\
  \ but until then I will look back on that day as a fond memory."
