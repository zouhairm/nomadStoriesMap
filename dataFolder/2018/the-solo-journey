Text: "Just one more step, I told myself. Every step up the steep incline felt excruciating.\
  \ The wind howled in my ears, whipping wet strands of hair around my numb face.\
  \ I peered over the edge of the caldera. There was nothing underneath me but a blanket\
  \ of thick fog, and the wind tugged at me teasingly, reminding me how far up I was.\
  \ And as I squinted in front of me, seeing nothing but fog, I was also reminded\
  \ of how alone I was.\n\nI was backpacking alone in New Zealand, and some travelers\
  \ told me about Tongariro Alpine Crossing. It was allegedly one of the best day\
  \ hikes in the entire country. I was skeptical at first. As a city girl born and\
  \ raised in New York, I had never done much hiking before. But New Zealand is a\
  \ country known for its gorgeous landscapes, so I decided to do the last thing anyone,\
  \ including myself, would have ever expected from me. I signed up for a seven-hour\
  \ hike. \n\nFor hours, I walked alone among frozen tussocks of grass, hearing nothing\
  \ but the crunching of my shoes on the frost. I climbed up steep inclines that never\
  \ seemed to end, and I stopped to wheeze every now and then as the air grew thinner.\
  \ My fingers grew number and number from the biting cold. The light drizzle turned\
  \ into a heavy downpour which turned into hailstones. I put my hood up and kept\
  \ hiking.\n\nAt last, I reached the highest point. Enveloped in fog, I could not\
  \ see anything ahead of me. I sat down on a jagged boulder in exhaustion, and tore\
  \ ravenously into the sandwich I had packed with me. \n\nSuddenly, the fog cleared.\
  \ One strong gust of wind later, the skies were clear and blue. The sun beamed down\
  \ on me. And the entire valley was laid out before me. I leaped to my feet in disbelief.\
  \ There it all was, like a scene from Mars. Around me, there were red craters billowing\
  \ steam ominously. And nestled in the heart of the valley were three emerald green\
  \ lakes, glittering like jewels under the midday sun.    \n\nFor a long time, I\
  \ stayed there. Time seemed to slow down to a halt. The strong rays of sunshine\
  \ thawed my frozen fingers, and the green lakes sparkled at me beguilingly. With\
  \ every breeze, the lakes would ripple with shades of jade and turquoise. In that\
  \ moment, it was just me and the vast scenery all around me. I felt deeply impressed\u2014\
  impressed with the breathtaking landscape, but also impressed with myself for conquering\
  \ a difficult hike all by myself and finding the willpower inside me that I never\
  \ knew I had."
