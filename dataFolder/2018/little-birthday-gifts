Text: "The thought of getting older to most people comes with dread and uneasiness,\
  \ but not this now 40 year old who spent her birthday exploring Iceland. It was\
  \ the little things on my actual birthday that I least expected and appreciated\
  \ the most about the trip. I traveled with my sister and friend and we planned our\
  \ ice caving adventure for my actual birthday this past January. Let me just say\
  \ that it would have been easier to get a hotel closer to J\xF6kuls\xE1rl\xF3n than\
  \ to take the 5 hour drive from Reykjav\xEDk but it was an adventure and our first\
  \ time in Iceland. Our drive started at 5am and we didn\u2019t encounter any bad\
  \ weather until we were about half way there, almost to Vik, when our car was lifted\
  \ off the road for what seemed like ages but in reality was more like two seconds\
  \ and placed back down without incident. Can you say at 730 in the morning everyone\
  \ in the car was wide awake! Our first stop was to get gas in this little town Kirkjubeajarklauster\
  \ where we would later that night have the celebratory birthday dinner, which by\
  \ the way was phenomenal! Iceland is probably the most credit card friendly country\
  \ I have been to, except at the fuel pumps, both fill ups required an inside excursion\
  \ along with some snacks and drinks. After our stop, as we drove towards Glacier\
  \ Lagoon, we got to watch sunrise for third time this trip and it was beautiful\
  \ with light bouncing off the mountains and glaciers even if it was a bit overcast.\
  \ By the time we made it to our destination we had just enough time to walk the\
  \ black sand crystal beach, aka Diamond Beach, and take pictures of the beautiful\
  \ chunks of ice laying on the sand and try not to get blown into the ocean! Our\
  \ cave trip started at noon, after a quick snack and change of shoes, we met out\
  \ awesome and fun tour guides Axel-the driver and Bas-the Dutchman guide, who I\
  \ found out later is a Dutch Marine (I swoon for Marines\U0001F497), one of those\
  \ little least expected things for my birthday. Because of the weather, and not\
  \ like we minded, but it ended up just being the three of us and our guides. We\
  \ rode out onto the glacier in a large converted van to a newly found ice cave and\
  \ Bas oh so kindly assisted me with my crampons, how could I refuse! He lead us\
  \ to the very back of the cave where we spent about an hour taking pictures and\
  \ talking! Talk about great customer service and on the way back Axel stopped at\
  \ least 4 times for us to take pictures on the glacier! I couldn\u2019t have asked\
  \ for a better 40th birthday!"
