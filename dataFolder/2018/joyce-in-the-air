Text: "Poor, poor girl...I got lost in the small city of Dublin. You are giggling\
  \ now, ok, but it happened. Cozy alleys were getting gloomy, frightful and insecure.\
  \ Goodbye, my Irish peace, hello, my Russian fear.\n\xABTake a map\xBB, I said to\
  \ myself. The big map was in my hand but it was awkward. \nThe man was sitting on\
  \ the street bench. He was staring at me, and I had some kind of feeling that he\
  \ wanted to help me. I remember one Scottish guy who told me that I looked so small\
  \ and helpless that everybody wanted to protect me from evil. \n\xABSir, could you\u2026\
  \xBB\n\xABOf course, my dear\u2026 Where were you born? Have you noticed that I\
  \ didn\u2019t ask you, where you are from. The most important thing to know is about\
  \ homeland of people\xBB.  \n\xABRussia, I was born there\xBB. \n\xABExcellent!\
  \ I have been to Saint Petersburg, and it was a great pleasure\u2026 My dear, you\
  \ know, you have good English without Russian accent. So, what is that young lady\
  \ doing in Dublin?\u201D\nTruly, I didn\u2019t speak English well, but he as other\
  \ native speakers thought that it is was very difficult to learn other languages.\
  \ Laziness and sense of superiority might be the reason, I suppose. Nevertheless,\
  \ he was intelligent and kind, teacher of Trinity College named Patrick \u2013 like\
  \ everyone in Ireland. I think he was in his fifties and, finally, the biggest fan\
  \ of Joyce. \n\xABDo you know any Joyce\u2019s places here? \xBB he asked me suavely.\
  \ \nHonestly, many years ago I tried to read a popular book of the author. You know,\
  \ Ulysses. However, I got entangled in the labyrinth of his thoughts. I stopped\
  \ my anguish. My God, how could people understand it? \n\xABWow, I would like to\
  \ know\xBB, I played my enthusiasm very truly. \nPatrick told me unknown historical\
  \ things about Joyce, other Irish writers, Dublin in general. Finally, he showed\
  \ me the right way and we found each other in Facebook. Actually, before our meeting\
  \ I had been planning one-day trip to Belfast. The homeland of Titanic, the city\
  \ of graffiti. In fact, he made me crazy about Dublin, and I stayed there to explore\
  \ it more. \nFour years after. He is still fond of Joyce, and I\u2019m glad to keep\
  \ in touch with my Joyce\u2019s guide. However, I have not read Ulysses yet. I\u2019\
  m waiting for the special moment. My retirement, I guess. \nBy the way, I remember\
  \ the Joyce\u2019s phrase: \xABIf Dublin were ever destroyed, it could be rebuilt\
  \ with using Ulysses as a model\xBB. Therefore, you are immortal, Irish city\u2026\
  Next time I will take Ulysses to research all the places where the main hero was.\
  \ I have to. I promised Patrick."
