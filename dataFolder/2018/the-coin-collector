Text: "\u201CWhatever you do, do not give money to the begging kids in India\u201D\
  \ I repeat this advice to myself as I ignore the 14th child today clawing at my\
  \ skirt, pretending not to feel their tiny fingers. \u201CIt only adds to the problem\u201D\
  \ I say with faux conviction as a pair of big, dark eyes stare right through my\
  \ stony fa\xE7ade. \u201CEducation is free in India, they should be at school\u201D\
  \ I justify as I almost shout \u2018NO\u2019 at a relentless boy who has followed\
  \ me down the surprisingly cooling, blue-painted streets for the last ten minutes.\
  \ He startles, gives up and runs off.\nAnother pang of guilt. My 14th for the day.\
  \ Up ahead, I see the ancient Mehrengarh Fort beaming on the hill. \u2018Almost\
  \ there\u2019 I sigh eager to escape the dusty, confronting streets. Nearby a skeletal\
  \ cow groans.\nAnother small boy of about nine appears and walks alongside me staring\
  \ watching me with blank, unblinking eyes. \u201CCan I have some money?\u201D he\
  \ finally asks. Feeling overwhelmed and suffocated by the humidity, the narrowing\
  \ streets, chai merchants, and my gnawing conscience, I hand him some Rupees. He\
  \ frowns and shakes his head and I feel as I\u2019ve suddenly offended him. \u201C\
  Not Indian coins. Money from YOUR country. I like to collect the coins for my geography\
  \ class\u201D he explains.\nSurprised and humbled, I tell him to meet me at my hostel\
  \ later that evening where I have some coins I can give to him. He walks alongside\
  \ me and we begin to chat about his favorite school subjects and how he wants to\
  \ be a scientist when he grows up. \u201CEducation is the most important\u201D he\
  \ tells me sternly. \nHours later, after touring the Fort with its Moghul arts and\
  \ antique artillery collections, unexpected polo history and unrivaled panoramic\
  \ views, I return to find the boy waiting patiently on the uneven doorstep of my\
  \ hostel. I gather some spare Australian coins from my suitcase and as I hand them\
  \ to him I point out the kangaroo, emu and platypus. His face beams, prouder than\
  \ the Fort on the hill, before inviting me to meet his family and have some chai\
  \ at his house where I\u2019m \u201Calways\u201D welcome.\nToday, I had only planned\
  \ to marvel at India\u2019s rich history, but I think I just glimpsed its future."
