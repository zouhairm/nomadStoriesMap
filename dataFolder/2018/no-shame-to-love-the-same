Text: "No Shame to Love the Same\n\u201CIn this moment I think of Plato\u2019s symposium.\
  \ It deals with being physically attracted to someone and the mystery behind it.\
  \ He explains his theory by saying that two people were initially joined together.\
  \ In other words, you had three types of units each with two heads, four legs and\
  \ four arms. There were three \u2018sexes\u2019 \u2013 units with two men, units\
  \ with two women and then units with one man and one women. But somehow we pissed\
  \ Zeus off and he decided to take his revenge by cutting all the units in half.\
  \ Ever since then we have been wandering around the earth in search for our other\
  \ half.\u201D                                                                  \
  \                                                                              \
  \       - A quote from a book that explains two lesbian characters in this love\
  \ story, how a bond specially formed between two people cannot be broken. \nTwo\
  \ hands joined together, two bodies against each other \u2013 two bodies that look\
  \ the same. It amazed me how their bodies connect on more than one level, dancing\
  \ to the beat of the slow rhythm echoing across the room, with no worries accept\
  \ the judgement they receive outside of these walls. \nA small dark room, with sheer\
  \ light streaks coming from the roof, only showing sweaty faces, dripping make-up\
  \ and see-through clothes on moving bodies. A conversation in every corner and by\
  \ their slight smiles, I encounter not just single temptation but actual attraction.\
  \ My first time here and I am already planning my next visit. Who knew a gay/lesbian\
  \ bar can make you feel so content, relaxed, yourself, in a few minutes? With many\
  \ gay friends there will always be a party, but my first time joining them they\
  \ decided to take their visits outside of Cape Town, until we ended up outside of\
  \ the Western Cape. So this was the last thing I expected, enjoying every minute\
  \ of my journey, travelling to different gay clubs. Here you see the exact opposite\
  \ of how society sees it, here you see love, pleasure and unity, rather than hearing\
  \ that being gay or lesbian is sinful and inhumane. We all have human rights, sexual\
  \ orientation and a gender identity. We all want to love and be loved by someone\
  \ that makes you feel comfortable and safe. Why must it be different for a gay man\
  \ or a lesbian woman, just because they have the same private parts or the same\
  \ gender? Love stays love, whether it is between a man or a woman, between two men,\
  \ or between two women; the emotion does not change."
