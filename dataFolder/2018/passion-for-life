Text: "I was sitting on the grass, smelling the larch in the autumn sun and watching\
  \ the small carlines around me. As locals told me, carlines can predict the weather.\
  \ It was time for me to leave. \nI arrived to Saint-Nicolas to study the Francoproven\xE7\
  al language, that has already disappeared in most placed elsewhere, but is still\
  \ used as vernacular there, in the Aosta Valley. This autonomous region of Italy\
  \ is one of the highest in the Alps. The country around Mont Blanc, as this borderland\
  \ with France and Switzerland is locally referred to.\n\u201CWith neither feet,\
  \ nor head,\u201D as they say, Saint-Nicolas is a green plateau at the edge of the\
  \ cliffs at 1,200 metres above sea level, surrounded by snowy peaks over 4,000 metres.\n\
  I was given an apartment by the municipality. My neighbour, in his early 40s, was\
  \ a firefighter. \n\u201CIt\u2019s very convenient,\u201D he says, as it allows\
  \ him to volunteer as a mayor while he works at night. \nHe likes to get up at 5am\
  \ and run up to a nearest peak above 3,000 metres. By 8am, he is already in the\
  \ municipal hall, filling it with his energy, totally present in the community life\
  \ and, indeed, in his own life, overcoming the fatigue and making every moment count.\
  \ \u201CA day without taking a risk is a lost day,\u201D he says.\nComing from a\
  \ city and being used to privacy, all of a sudden I felt fully immersed in the hectic\
  \ community life too. As I watch the village streets curve under my feet, memories\
  \ flash through my mind.\nThe corv\xE9e, a day of common labour in the community,\
  \ preparing the grounds for the spring. It finished in the night in mayor\u2019\
  s cave, sharing local wine, cheese fontina and boudeun (sausages with beetroots\
  \ and potatoes). \nQueens\u2019 battles in summer (Queens are cows) and the pure\
  \ joy of dancing waltzes in bars at the dezarpa, popular festivities around the\
  \ descent of the cows from alpine pastures.\nThe heat from the communal oven and\
  \ the smell of freshly baked bread at the approach of winter. The crunch of fresh\
  \ snow under the skis...\nChildren must be playing downhill. We invented a game:\
  \ I would show them pictures from my travels, and they would guess the place and\
  \ say \u201Chello\u201D in the language of that place. It was not very hard for\
  \ them, as at the age of three they already spoke three languages: Francoproven\xE7\
  al; Italian and French, co-official in the region, and started learning English.\
  \ \nAs the rocks reflect their voices, it seems like a child is laughing behind\
  \ every larch. I laugh too, and leave with a smile."
