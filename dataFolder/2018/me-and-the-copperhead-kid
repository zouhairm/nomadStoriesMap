Text: "\"Ya'll ever see a copperhead before?\"\n\nThe kid standing before us must've\
  \ been around our age, 16 or 17, but I barely registered his presence. I was too\
  \ fixated on the dead snake he was holding up by the tail like a hard-won trophy.\
  \ The snake must've been the kid's attempt at a conversation-starter.\n\nIt didn't\
  \ work. The snake did draw a few disgusted groans and mean-spirited snickers, but\
  \ the majority of us simply ignored him. Eventually, the proud look on the kid's\
  \ face faded, replaced by a mix of understanding and embarrassment, and he trudged\
  \ off in the direction of the rusted bike that had brought him to us.\n\nAs I watched\
  \ the kid's hunched shape disappear from sight, I felt my cheeks redden. What the\
  \ hell was wrong with us? I thought.\n\nHabitat for Humanity brought my classmates\
  \ and me hundreds of miles from our comfortable suburban homes to a dirt-poor southern\
  \ region of Appalachia. We were there to help build a house for a poor family, but\
  \ we spent most of our time on the work-site posing for photos with our hammers\
  \ and toolbelts on full display. When we showed these pictures to our friends, they'd\
  \ say \"I can't believe you gave up an entire week of your summer to do this. You're\
  \ such a good person.\"\n\nGood people would've embraced the kid with the snake.\n\
  \nThe day after the copperhead incident, I found myself wandering around the town,\
  \ an eyesore in the middle of what would otherwise be screensaver-caliber natural\
  \ beauty, looking for photo ops. But every postcard-worthy shot of the mythical\
  \ mountain range was ruined by a decaying shell of an old business or a dilapidated\
  \ shack. On the steps of one such dwelling, I spotted the copperhead kid, whittling\
  \ away at a walking stick with an impressive knife.\n\nI approached cautiously and\
  \ asked, \"Hey man, do you know any good trails in those mountains? I'm looking\
  \ for a spot with a view.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" the kid said. \"But the path's not real\
  \ clear, and you're liable to get lost on your own. I'll just take you -- my name's\
  \ Troy, by the way.\"\n\nThe \"path\" was a brutal uphill climb directly through\
  \ briar patches and poison ivy, and the view was limited to the endless rows of\
  \ massive tree trunks surrounding us in every direction. Eventually, Troy brought\
  \ me to a clearing where a blanket of green stretched out all the way to the horizon.\n\
  \n\"This spot reminds me there's more out there than my shitty little town,\" Troy\
  \ said. \"I come here when I want to get away from everything.\" \n\nMe, I was there\
  \ to get closer to it all."
