Text: "Chennai is not a place tourists stay long. The city crawls from the sea, dragging\
  \ its bulk inland. It\u2019s crowded, without the charisma of Delhi, and coastal,\
  \ without the grandeur of Mumbai. But it\u2019s home to Prema Vasam, the orphanage\
  \ where I lived and worked for three months, and Prema Vasam is a place of great\
  \ beauty.\n\nPrema Vasam is a 45-minute auto-rickshaw ride from the airport. They\
  \ teem along busy streets, jostling for space. The roads gradually narrow until\
  \ you reach the end of a dusty lane. Heat blankets the ground in swathes; walking\
  \ is more like wading. The clamour of children\u2019s play sounds in the distance,\
  \ as it does the world over, and the smell of dust coats your tongue; a burnt-orange,\
  \ copper smell, with a hint of paan.\n\nThe orphanage itself is three storeys high,\
  \ L-shaped, and painted a blue I associate with carnival rides and chocolate wrappers.\
  \ The roof is ablaze with saris drying; a single mango tree grows in the courtyard.\n\
  \nI was terrified when I first arrived. Terrified of what to expect, of doing the\
  \ wrong thing. I volunteered at the orphanage almost on a whim. I was a newly minted\
  \ physiotherapist with no experience with children, let alone children with disabilities.\
  \ I had no higher purpose, no greater good driving me \u2013 just curiosity and\
  \ an overwhelming fear of my own ignorance. My aim was selfish \u2013 to become\
  \ a bigger person.\n\nHalf an hour after my arrival, I met Yamuna. Yamuna was roughly\
  \ fourteen years old at the time. I don\u2019t know for sure; nobody does. She has\
  \ severe mental disabilities; she can\u2019t walk, talk or feed herself. Her hair\
  \ was shaved to help manage her lice infestation. She was in a cot, tied in by the\
  \ waist to stop her falling out. I sat next to her; she looked at me and shrieked.\n\
  \nI responded the only way I knew \u2013 I sang \u2018Baby Got Back\u2019 by Sir\
  \ Mix-A-Lot. Yamuna shrieked again, grinned and beat her hands against the bed.\
  \ I was given a bowl of rice and sambar. I spent the next half hour clumsily hand-feeding\
  \ Yamuna, singing continuously. She gurgled along, one hand picking at the string\
  \ around her waist, the other thumping my knee every time I took too long to ferry\
  \ the next bite to her mouth. Her face was neon with joy.\n\nI went to Prema Vasam\
  \ out of a fear of ignorance. I hadn\u2019t anticipated how painful the process\
  \ of growth would be. Prema Vasam tore me open. Then it gathered me close and held\
  \ me until I mended. Prema Vasam, starting with Yamuna, first made me a smaller\
  \ person, and then I think \u2013 I hope \u2013 a bigger one."
