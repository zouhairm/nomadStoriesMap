Text: "This story begins when I thought to bring some inner peace for myself. I usually\
  \ end up texting or calling some of my close friends to come out of the blues. But\
  \ this time, I never wanted to churn up their mind with mine. So I decided to start\
  \ my journey to a place where I could get away with no much tension and stay in\
  \ peace. Since I am from Kerala, I spotted Munnar as it will enlighten any one's\
  \ soul with flourished fauna and flora. I did some quick booking for my stay and\
  \ pushed the gas pedal straight to Munnar. As I approached near, the wind became\
  \ breezy and it was foggy on the way.  As the route where my stay was arranged was\
  \ under construction, it remains closed for a longer period of time. I decided to\
  \ walk across the street and enjoy the food sitting along with some other tourists\
  \ and locals. The table was literally big and one person decided to sit away from\
  \ the other people around us. She started scribbling some notes on her Tablet and\
  \ started to ask another local about the places around. Since he stumbled upon communication,\
  \ my intrigue nature pushed me to help her. \nShe was a tough lady. Literally, at\
  \ the age of my eldest Aunt, the vivacity she displayed was amazing. I soon started\
  \ to like her company. As in when I started to exchange my feelings and experiences\
  \ with her, she listened and commented on them in her witty way but with real sense.\
  \ Coincidentally, we both had booked the same hotel and it was a bit longer drive\
  \ from the place where we were, because of the zigzag roads and maintenance. \n\
  Since she was from Alaska (place of mountains), I asked if we could combine together\
  \ and trek the highest peak of Munnar which is Meesapulimala. 4 hrs trekking seemed\
  \ very little for her at this age. She did almost 7 surgeries, one of which was\
  \ to replace her shoulders with a plastic one. I re-assured if she is okay if we\
  \ trek. We arranged a jeep which could take us near to the bottom of the peak.\n\
  The next day the deep came around 4 in the morning so that by the time we reach\
  \ the bottom of the peak we could enrich yourself with a wonderful sight of the\
  \ rising sun clearing away the fog. The Journey soon started to the top once we\
  \ had a sight of the sunrise. Everything we saw there had the beauty of nature imprinted\
  \ on it. Surprising me she took another invisible trail to the top where beautiful\
  \ plants and flowers were spotted. It was tough to reach there but she guided me\
  \ well in advance. \nFinally, we reached the top and the view was breathtaking.\
  \ TY"
