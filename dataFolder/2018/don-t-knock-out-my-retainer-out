Text: "I had told myself in Seattle before leaving that looking for a boxing gym would\
  \ be a great way to connect with folks, learn a new skill, and have some fun when\
  \ Im not writing fiction and exploring Panama City.  I imagined an old Panamanian\
  \ man short, sleeved Guayabera, cigar in mouth and black newsboy hat on his head.\
  \ I\u2019d seen too many boxing movies and had a strange romance for the history\
  \ of the sport in Panama. That night I stayed in the room and researched the gyms\
  \ in the area. Pedro \u201CRockero\u201D Alcazar came up.\n\n Knowing the general\
  \ direction of the gym by using the Metro Station 5 De Mayo as a reference point.\
  \ I walked to the station and rounded the corner onto the intimidating avenue Nacional.\
  \  The reason it scared me is because the first side street had to be crossed with\
  \ no light or crosswalk, only a prayer that buses and turning cars would eventually\
  \ give a large group of people the chance to cross and get on with their lives.\
  \ I passed Casinos, drunken indigenous men in back alleys, fruit and vegetable venders,\
  \ McDonalds walk up counters, Chinese owned electronic stores and Colombian corner\
  \ bakeries. \n\nI  walked up the gym steps.Covered in images of the famed Rockero\
  \ Alcazar in a mural of colorful and black and white pictures.  Eventually I chatted\
  \ with a man to ask him who to speak with, he told me soccer was his real sport\
  \ but he learned boxing later on. Something I could relate to in sports. I continued\
  \ to patiently watch the session. Minutes later the guy joked with me , saying if\
  \ I don\u2019t go ask I\u2019ll never learn and not be so shy. \n\u201CHis name\
  \ is Watson, he\u2019s right there.\u201D Said the man\nHe pointed to a short, small\
  \ dark man ringside on the furthest ring. He was wearing a cheap gas station type\
  \ of baseball hat , a t-shirt and baggy beach shorts. \n\n  The first class was\
  \ more cardio work, no sparring with a Panamanian Heavyweight or exciting speed\
  \ bag work caught on an iPhone.I liked Watson. He looked like he had stories to\
  \ tell if you could sit down with the man. His short white curly hair expressing\
  \ wisdom and memories from the past. Memories from the Caribbean city of El Colon.\
  \ \n Looking back my connection with Watson is distant. It wasn\u2019t until a bit\
  \ later I realized he was paid a salary by the city and therefore didn\u2019t have\
  \ a ton of interest in developing private boxing clients. I realized later I was\
  \ probably one of very few Gringos to ever pull up in his gym and ask for instructions.\
  \ Watson will always be my local connection in Curundu."
