Text: "Hardly anything compares to the feeling of losing yourself in the middle of\
  \ an unknown breathtaking landscape.\nRomania. 2016.\nThe warm mid-July Sun greeted\
  \ us as we decided to explore the hidden village of Breb, situated on the Gut\xE2\
  i mountains. The early joyful loudness of Nature kept us company while our feet\
  \ were leading the way and our eyes were amazed by the details of the entrance wooden\
  \ gates that stood tall all around the village.\nAfter roaming for a while, our\
  \ path took us eventually to her. Flora was her name and her voice was the gentle\
  \ breeze singing us a welcome song. The wooden plate announcing \u201CMESTESUGURI\
  \ CRAFTS\u201D was hanging on the gate and we entered following Flora\u2019s bright\
  \ smile. She invited us to sit around a table and we glanced at her hidden paradise\
  \ \u2013 a group of small cozy houses that had a common garden and a fountain. The\
  \ comfortable silence was only broken by her voice, as she introduced herself while\
  \ hand-spinning wool tread. Flora was born and raised in Breb and her family chose\
  \ to live elsewhere in Romania, leaving her to continue the crafts\u2019 heritage.\n\
  After a while, she gets up and calls us by the river as she bends and starts washing\
  \ a rug in the moving waters. It seemed like we were the observers of a place that\
  \ chose to not join the technological revolution and indeed there was something\
  \ wisely pure about it. Back in the garden, Flora showed us a wood-carved miniature\
  \ of the wooden gates we had seen earlier, made by her son. We did not hesitate\
  \ and decided to bring one as a special present from that out-of-this-world village.\
  \ The Sun was shining brighter and we could feel the ease of a summer day that turned\
  \ out to be unforgettable, but little did I know what was still to come. My Romanian\
  \ friend Radu explained that she was going to sing and the sweetest notes came out\
  \ of her lips. Suddenly, everything around us fitted into place as we were driven\
  \ by the melody. I wished it would never end and, surprisingly, that moment never\
  \ did end. I still get the feeling of solely being there, watching her continuing\
  \ the old traditions and happily singing.\nFrom that day, there are three things\
  \ I will never forget \u2013 the truthfulness of her soul, the traditions that became\
  \ alive on those eternal moments and that, when you lose yourself, sometimes you\
  \ end up finding exactly what you were searching for.\nFlora was one of the most\
  \ special people I will ever encounter."
