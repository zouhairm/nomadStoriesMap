Text: "The woody aroma of the cologne I put on that morning had left my body and been\
  \ replaced by the smell of my sweat-soaked shirt. Arriving at the hostel in Rio\
  \ de Janeiro, looking around the room, I caught glimpses of fifteen nationalities\
  \ hidden under their representatives\u2019 personalities. However, this time around\
  \ I could disregard historical tensions, international agreements and economic differences\
  \ to delve deeply inside each country\u2019s feelings.  \n\nFuerza (Strength):\n\
  \nIn an exchange of glances, I read Manuela\u2019s eyes. I could already tell she\
  \ was a strong woman. She had founded an NGO that protected children from the influence\
  \ of drug cartels in her community back in Bogota, and she emanated a fierce determination.\
  \ For once, I could easily recognize in someone else my Latino way of being, which\
  \ made me incredibly proud of it. Whether due to our gestures, our passion for salsa,\
  \ or our loud laughs, I could see myself in her and feel empowered to confront the\
  \ issues of my own neighborhood.\n\nSmelost\u2019 (Boldness):\n\nSlava\u2019s distinct\
  \ laid-back style was more than just fashion; it represented his courage to dare\
  \ to be different. From a distance, the Russian boy would not be someone with whom\
  \ I would normally relate. But since I had already stepped into the convention\u2019\
  s multicultural world, it was reckless to trust any preconceived ideas I might have\
  \ held. He sparked in me a desire to become bold and untied the moorings of my mind,\
  \ not only with regards to cultures, but also to people.\n\nElastizit\xE4t (Resilience):\n\
  \nAren't we all immigrants? I asked myself after meeting Ilayda, a Turkish girl\
  \ who became my main reference about Germany. She had left her hometown early in\
  \ life, but still strived to keep the traditions of her native culture. Her resourcefulness\
  \ in living between West and East enthralled me. When she tested my years of German\
  \ studies, I realized I was a bit German, too. Ilayda showed me what it is like\
  \ to be stateless in order to become a global citizen.\n\nNow, looking at a Vladivostok\
  \ magnet attached to my reading light, I reflect on how loving strangers could be\
  \ so natural. Each person I met that week is etched in my memory and has helped\
  \ shape who I am today. From that moment on, I felt what Paulo Coelho calls \u201C\
  the soul of the world\u201D \u2013a true feeling of belongingness through direct\
  \ contact with the natural force that rules the Earth. In those teenagers and their\
  \ cultures, I found nuances of my own self."
