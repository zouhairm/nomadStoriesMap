Text: "Canada had been good to me so far. Since walking across the border at Niagara\
  \ Falls I had managed to hitchhike to Toronto, Montreal and Quebec City. Now, however,\
  \ I found myself on the outskirts of a small town in New Brunswick and I had a problem;\
  \ it was getting dark. It is a lot more difficult to hitchhike after sunset. My\
  \ aim had been to get to somewhere worth staying before it got that late, but here\
  \ I was.\n\nOnce it was dark, I tried standing so I could be seen in the light of\
  \ the dim yellow streetlamp. I smiled at the drivers passing me by one by one. They\
  \ pretended not to notice. The beaming smile of a happy-go-lucky traveller must\
  \ have looked more sinister in the yellowy darkness.\n\nA million thoughts ran through\
  \ my mind. How had I got myself into this situation? Was I going to be stuck here?\
  \ Should I start walking? If so, which way?\n\nThen I had an idea. I reached into\
  \ my backpack and felt around for the Irish flag I had packed before leaving home.\
  \ I had read that the maritime provinces of Canada had a large percentage of people\
  \ with Irish ancestry. New Brunswick had even previously been named \u2018New Ireland\u2019\
  . Maybe I could appeal directly to the diaspora. I held out my flag. There were\
  \ fewer cars passing now, but it wasn\u2019t long before one stopped. My plan had\
  \ worked!\n\nI picked up my bag and ran towards the car. A woman opened the window\
  \ and spoke to me in French. \u201CI don\u2019t speak French,\u201D I said, in broken\
  \ French. \u201CYou\u2019ll have to squeeze into the back\u201D she said, now switching\
  \ to English. I could see now that she was middle-aged. Her husband was sitting\
  \ in the passenger seat. \u201CWe thought you were Acadian!\u201D he told me as\
  \ I got into the car. \u201CWhat\u2019s that?\u201D I asked hesitantly, not wanting\
  \ to offend but being thoroughly confused. I\u2019d never heard the word before.\n\
  \nThey explained to me that the Acadians were French settlers in the area, back\
  \ when the whole region was known as \u2018New France.\u2019 The majority of the\
  \ Acadians were later deported by the British, with many eventually settling in\
  \ Louisiana, where their descendants are known as Cajuns.\n\nThe Acadian flag is\
  \ similar to the French tricolour but with a small golden star at the top of the\
  \ blue section. In the dim light my green, white and orange flag had looked like\
  \ blue, white and red.\n\nMy new Acadian friends also offered me dinner and a place\
  \ to stay for the night. I gratefully accepted and left the next morning with some\
  \ new knowledge, a spring in my step and the small Acadian flag pin I had been given."
