Text: "Erotica, sex, basic instincts et al sells!\nDisagree? You are still reading\
  \ isn\u2019t it?\n\nMost of the guides at Khajuraho, specially the international\
  \ ones, use it to sell tourism! As also do the roadside souvenir stores.  But then\
  \ erotica is merely 5% of the fantastic artwork. Here basic instinct, from being\
  \ an aggressive lust, gets transformed into a submissive love; fulfillment of all\
  \ earthly desires paves the road for merger of the soul in to the light of eternal\
  \ bliss. \n\nLadies giggle, men ogle, teenagers glance on the sly \u2013 as if the\
  \ 1000 year old Temples of Khajuraho represents only coupling of bodies, but what\
  \ they miss out are beautiful sculpted spires, the splendid entrance to the temples,\
  \ the immaculate three stage mandapas and the grand garvagriha \u2013 which houses\
  \ the deity basking in natural light \u2013a marvelous engineering achievement in\
  \ itself.\n\nStanding tall for over a millennia, these temples built by the descendants\
  \ of the Moon God, are man\u2019s offering to the Lord himself. Walls of the temples\
  \ are adorned with thematic sculptures created by hundreds of highly skilled master\
  \ craftsmen. Whatever little erotica there is exists only on the outer wall- there\
  \ are no sensuous sculptures inside - desires, carnal or otherwise, are to be left\
  \ out.\n\nGuides and tourists - overlooking the deep hidden messages, the spiritual\
  \ aspects, the fine carvings - push me to the edge of my patience. \u201CSex a galore!\u201D\
  \ stigmatizes someone. This is the last thing I expect from educated folks!\n\n\
  \ I rebel in silence and head for the near empty Nandi sanctorium. In Hindu mythology,\
  \ Nandi the bull, bearer of truth and righteousness, is the vehicle of Lord Shiva.\
  \ \n\nConfirming to folklore, my wife whispers her wish in to the Bull\u2019s ear.\
  \ I too make my wishes. A young couple looks on. They are a beautiful pair. I inquire\
  \ from which country they are; the boy in his halting English tells me their nationality.\n\
  \nHe then asks us what we were doing. I explain that it is like the Trevi Fountain\
  \ of Rome, you can make a wish by whispering it in to Nandi\u2019s ear. The lady\
  \ can wish that you two get married soon or you may wish that MY favorite footballer\
  \ wins this year\u2019s world cup for YOUR country, just like that.\nThey both smile\
  \ and make their respective wishes. We make a local connection, with each other,\
  \ with Nandi \u2013 the vehicle of Shiva!\n\nThe girl in her sweet voice says \u2013\
  \ \u201CGracias!\u201D The boy raises his thumb, \u201CLet Leo win it for both of\
  \ us!\u201D\n\nWe all smile! After all they are from Argentina!"
