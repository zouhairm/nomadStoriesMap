Text: "I and my friends were cutting vegetables for our dinner in a small muddy house,\
  \ the lantern was brightened. I could hear the sound of gentle breezes coming from\
  \ Nanga Parbat (The Killer Mountain), the sky was covered with clouds and the environment\
  \ around us was roofed with white snow blanket. The fire in traditional stove brewed\
  \ water, after some minutes of continuous efforts; we prepared our dinner and ate\
  \ it all with local chapattis. Soon after dinner, I made local green tea from wild\
  \ thyme leaves, not just to digest our food, but to also maintain our body temperature\
  \ with that of freezing surrounding.\n\n    We started gossips about our lives for\
  \ like three hours, and in very same period of time, we felt sleepy and decided\
  \ to sleep so that we would be able to open our eyes early in next morning to continue\
  \ our mission which was planned to scale at least half of Nanga Parbat in first\
  \ attempt. We opened our sleeping bags and off the lantern. After couple of minutes,\
  \ my friends started snoring; meanwhile, I wasn\u2019t slept thinking about scaling\
  \ of Nanga Parbat which was a very great risk we had taken as it had taken the lives\
  \ of many people earlier in the region. Thinking about the journey, I felt thirsty\
  \ and opened my torch to have a glass of water. I stood up to drink water, and took\
  \ a sigh after having a glass. The sigh interrupted the slumber of my friend, Ammad.\
  \ He woke up and asked, \u201CHaven\u2019t you slept yet? I replied, very soon.\
  \ Ammad was very keen about scaling the mountain, and he was very curious among\
  \ us. Meanwhile, I also closed my eyes and started living dream life. \n\n   We\
  \ woke up at 06:00 AM, and prepared our local breakfast. During breakfast, Ammad\
  \ said, \u201CGuys, we\u2019re on a great mission which is very dangerous we may\
  \ even loss our lives.\u201D We accepted this statement and started our mission\
  \ with full scaling kit. Ammad was leading our way, we eventually scaled 2000m.\
  \ After this we started facing hurdles to continue our mission, we planned to get\
  \ back, but Ammad refused and continued his way. After some time, he suffered snow\
  \ blindness and frostbit, but he never gave up. Soon, he lost the battle of his\
  \ life and after some hours we returned homes missing our friend, Ammad. \n\n  \
  \  Since that day, I\u2019ve believed that we\u2019ve always a local connection\
  \ with anything in the world; we just have to feel it and conquer. I\u2019ll for\
  \ sure try fulfilling the mission of my friend by scaling it next time and now it\
  \ has become my local connection and aim of my life."
