Text: "We finally made it into this quadratic box of oxidized metal, filled up with\
  \ passengers beyond its capacity. You could feel every little bump under your feet,\
  \ while this tiny sardine box was racing across the street. \nOur journey started\
  \ on an immensely crowded highway, leaving from dusty and chaotic Beirut towards\
  \ the ancient ruins of the world\u2019s first city: Byblos. We would find answers\
  \ to desperate questions of mankind and I hoped I could find out why Beirut was\
  \ just so impossible to grasp. Until now, it was just like a wild, lucid zoo spectacle\
  \ with fast-moving metal boxes, constant honking of dusty horns and confusing Roman\
  \ labyrinths of double named streets. \n\nThis day was incredibly hot and the roaring\
  \ wind tried to burn off our skin while we were trying to find a vehicle to get\
  \ us to our destination. We immediately got lost on the busiest square of the city\
  \ where a bus supposedly was about to leave. There were no signs, no street names\
  \ and the only indication for any transport were jumbled gatherings. Running up\
  \ and down the square made it clear that we were lost in a grey veil of confusion\
  \ covering us from the sparkling enlightenment all the inhabitants of Beirut must\
  \ have had. Some of them tried to help but the instructions we received were just\
  \ more confusing. While people mumbled in sharp but beautiful Arab words, we were\
  \ stepping through the messy crowds. I was just about to give up. The heat, the\
  \ heavy curtain of pollution and the dizzy cloud of chaos just made it impossible\
  \ to get by. How could anyone master this city?\nIt was only then that out of nothing\
  \ that this dubious looking van became visible when the rest stayed blurred. Its\
  \ driver in worn-down jeans was yelling: \u201CJbail, yes Byblos, Yallah\u201D.\
  \ Taking a leap of faith, we decided to submit to the city and hopped into the car.\n\
  \nThe van was racing across the highway like a loose roller coaster. The crumbly\
  \ metal door of the minivan could not close anymore. The lack of a belt got compromised\
  \ by the secure stickiness to one another. I could taste the dust that was whirled\
  \ up by the competing herd of cars and moving chaos and I started to be happy. It\
  \ suddenly became clear that the colorful chaos of this city works, somehow there\
  \ is a hidden rule in between the layers. And as long as it is not visible to us,\
  \ we just have to trust that it always works out. \nAnd it actually did when we\
  \ were thrown out in the middle of the highway right next to what is known to be\
  \ the oldest city of the world."
