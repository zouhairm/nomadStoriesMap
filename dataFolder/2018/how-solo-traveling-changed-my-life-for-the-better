Text: "I had just returned from England with my family to my warm and smoky hometown\
  \ of Mission, BC, Canada. Warm because it was summer; smoky because of the many\
  \ forest fires that had plagued Western Canada and the US last year. Mission was\
  \ blanketed in a thick, gray smoke \u2013 even partially blocking out the sun making\
  \ it appear florescent red.\nI felt uninspired when I got back to Mission. What\
  \ had seemed like such an adventure \u2013 touring the streets of London by myself\
  \ \u2013 was curtailed by a sun that looked as dull as I felt and the smell of camp\
  \ fire, only making me yearn for roasted marshmallows and clear nights under the\
  \ stars.\nI was miserable, so I spontaneously left for Ontario to meet a friend\
  \ in Toronto who talked highly of solo-traveling: \u201CIt\u2019ll change your life,\u201D\
  \ he had been saying fervently over the years. Well, I finally took his advice and\
  \ planned my first solo-trip to Colombia despite all odds.\nI did not speak a lick\
  \ of Spanish and only had $2000 to last me a month of backpacking. Indeed, the odds\
  \ seemed against me.\nI was frightened on the plane ride from Toronto to El Dorado\
  \ International Airport in Bogota. I saw a woman who looked like my mom and I began\
  \ to cry. I thought, \u201CWhat am I doing? I\u2019m going to die on this trip!\u201D\
  \ I wished I had never left my smoky but safe hometown.\nHowever, my new Colombian\
  \ friend has said something to me that changed everything. She said, \u201CThere\
  \ is a reason that you have come to Colombia.\" Upon hearing her profound words,\
  \ I was no longer paralyzed by fear and began my journey.\nFrom the busy streets\
  \ of Bogota, I bused to the small but lush city of Salento, famous for its Cocora\
  \ Valley \u2013 a national park exuberant with Ceroxylon quindiuense, a waxy palm\
  \ tree. Some of these palms can grow as tall as 80 meters (262 ft.). I didn't understand\
  \ how they could stand on nothing but a single and barren white trunk.\nTo get to\
  \ Cocora Valley, a slew of jeeps arrive on the town square to load up on tourists.\
  \ I felt so free riding on the back of the jeep with only my feet on the bumper\
  \ and the grip of my hands to support me.\nMy friend was right, solo-traveling had\
  \ changed my life. I was a zombie before I left and I came back home anew. The last\
  \ thing I had expected for myself that summer was to travel for a month in 3 different\
  \ countries with only my school backpack. And I still can't believe I planned my\
  \ first solo-trip in one week's time."
