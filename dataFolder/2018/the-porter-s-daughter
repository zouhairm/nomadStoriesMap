Text: "There are different kinds of travel. There\u2019s the travel to new places,\
  \ to see sights unseen, and there\u2019s the travel to places past, that release\
  \ memories and share them anew. Every place has a history and learning it only adds\
  \ to the richness of your experience. \nThe first time I saw Mt Kenya was on a game\
  \ drive with our Masai guide, James. We were learning how different tribes have\
  \ revered Mt Kenya as a holy site. Impossibly tall, crystal blue spires rose, massive\
  \ and ethereal, at a great distance from us. In a truly cloudless sky, tufts of\
  \ white fluff settled into layers of peaks and valleys.\nAfter visiting a small\
  \ gear shop hidden in the dusty town of Nanyuki, we found ourselves at the gates\
  \ of the national park. Our hike began in equatorial rainforest, surrounded by acacia,\
  \ eucalyptus, thorny scrub, and groves of bamboo.\nAt camp, massive trees loomed\
  \ heavy with moss and lichen, saturated into a deep evergreen color as the valley\
  \ lost sunlight. Rain hit the tin roof of our temporary home, adding symphony to\
  \ the cacophony of birds and scuttling creatures. The initials of those who\u2019\
  d come before us were etched into support beams and bed frames. \nThe next morning\
  \ we traveled upwards across moorlands. Now the strange landscape heightened and\
  \ stretched; for as far as I could see were rapidly moving clouds, giant groundsels,\
  \ and tall lobelia.\nPart of the joy of exploration is the element of newness, but\
  \ its depth comes from the long history of those who explored before. We hiked to\
  \ 14,200 feet, to Mackinder\u2019s Valley, so named for Sir Halford Mackinder, who\
  \ was the first to lead an expedition to Mt Kenya in 1899. And so it was, is and\
  \ shall be, what was his first was now ours. Our trek into Mt Kenya followed the\
  \ same trail with modern modifications: ecotourism.\nOne of my favorite memories\
  \ is dropping off our porter, Alan. The van had picked us up at the entrance to\
  \ the park and we ambled down the dirt road, trying to catch a breeze in a malodorous\
  \ atmosphere. The golden light of afternoon caught dust particles churned by our\
  \ tires, making them sparkle, and we dropped him off by the side of a small dirt\
  \ road lined with trees. He picked up his backpack, adjusted his hat, waved goodbye\
  \ to us, and started to walk away. A young girl in a school uniform ran across a\
  \ planted field towards him. Seeing them hug so tightly through the back window\
  \ firmly settled in my mind that bonding over a shared love of the outdoors will\
  \ pave the way towards a brighter future."
