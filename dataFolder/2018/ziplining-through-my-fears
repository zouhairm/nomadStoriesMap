Text: "In the summer of 2017, I decided to embark on a journey that would push me\
  \ to new limits. I had been visiting some family in Calgary, Alberta (I live in\
  \ Ontario) when my grandparents announced that my aunt Margaret would be coming\
  \ to visit. My aunt and I have always been very close and awfully adventurous so\
  \ when she suggested that I go to British Columbia with her for 2 weeks I was beyond\
  \ happy. We set out on the 10-hour long road trip a couple days later. During my\
  \ visit we had done lots of hiking and exploring but what I was most excited for\
  \ was a surprise I had planned out for us both, ziplining in Whistler! It was something\
  \ neither of us had ever experienced and with my fear of heights and falling, I\
  \ knew it\u2019d be something to remember. When I told her about it she seemed a\
  \ little hesitant but agreed to try it anyways. It was a long 2-hour long drive\
  \ to Whistler, but once we got there we were amazed with how beautiful it was. We\
  \ took a bus to get from our parking spot to the final destination where we\u2019\
  d be meeting with our leaders who were in charge of our group. The ziplining started\
  \ at the very top of Cougar Mountain so we got to take an atv ride to the top. The\
  \ view was amazing, looking down you could see thousands of trees and you could\
  \ even see Green Lake, it was absolutely breathtaking. Once at the top, we were\
  \ told that we would be going on a set of 4 different ziplines, one of them being\
  \ over 500 feet high, a kilometre long and reaching a speed of over 100km/h! To\
  \ say the least, we were in for a thrill. Our leaders chose my aunt and I to go\
  \ first, after we exchanged a look that said \u201Care we really doing this?\u201D\
  \ we got strapped in. A minute later we heard the speaker announce that we could\
  \ go down. My adrenaline felt like it was going to pour out of my ears, finally\
  \ we jumped and suddenly I felt like I was flying. As we soared through the skies\
  \ I took a look around and the only thing I could think of was how unconditionally\
  \ happy I was. I had conquered my biggest fear and I felt so proud of myself, in\
  \ that moment I knew that\u2019s how I wanted to live life. I wanted to push myself\
  \ further and experience new things. I felt free. We went on to finish the courses\
  \ and we were both so happy by the end of the day, we agreed that we\u2019d have\
  \ to come back and enjoy it again."
