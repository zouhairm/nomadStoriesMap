Text: "The sudden, stinging pain in my eyes was the only thing piercing the suffocating\
  \ darkness. Had I just been attacked with acid? Wait, are they laughing? While the\
  \ pungent darkness, unexpected icy splash to my face, and biting pain had momentarily\
  \ paralyzed me with panic and confusion they had also parted the \u201Cniebla de\
  \ vino,\u201D or wine haze in my head allowing me to start to grasp the situation.\
  \ With the lights flickering back on and the world around me rebooting back to life\
  \ I felt an enormous hand swallow the back of my neck while a musty wine skin was\
  \ shoved in my face. A booming voice, somehow even stronger than his grip advised\
  \ me that it was better to drink the wine this time around as opposed to washing\
  \ my face with it. \u201CAmericano, se bebe el vino, no se lava la cara!\u201D as\
  \ he and everyone around me exploded into backbreaking laughter. I too had to crack\
  \ an embarrassed smile at it all now. Heck, even the salt-cured pig's head hanging\
  \ from the rafter above me was smiling. \n\nXavier, my new friend or perhaps more\
  \ accurately \u201Ctorturer,\u201D instructed me on how to point my head towards\
  \ the sky, extend the wine skin at arm\u2019s length and squeeze a steady, arcing,\
  \ arrow of local Monterrei wine at face, this time being sure to make a direct strike\
  \ on my tonsils instead of my eyes. He and his cousin Yago tried to contain their\
  \ laughter while explaining to me that it was a family tradition to play pranks\
  \ on the other villagers who visited their basement wine \u201Cbodega\u201D. They\
  \ would plunge the dungeon-like stone basement into total darkness and then fling\
  \ wine everywhere. All of the locals of course, knew to close their eyes and cover\
  \ their faces. Naturally, only \u201Cguiris\u201D or foreigners, along with the\
  \ occasional drunken local were ever surprised by the prank. Glancing around I noticed\
  \ that only I had crimson tears dripping down my face. It then dawned on me that\
  \ I had to be the only one of the two-hundred or so costume-clad revelers celebrating\
  \ Oimbra\u2019s Carnaval who hadn\u2019t been born there. \n\nIt was pure coincidence\
  \ that I had even ended up here in this tiny town tucked into a forgotten corner\
  \ of Spain\u2019s northwestern Galician region, so close to Portugal in fact, that\
  \ my phone thought I was over the border. While hitchhiking earlier that day to\
  \ the more famous and touristic Carnaval celebration in nearby Verin, I had been\
  \ given a lift and graciously offered a place to sleep. Unbeknownst to me it would\
  \ end up being the most unexpected yet unforgettable \u201Cfiesta\u201D of my life."
