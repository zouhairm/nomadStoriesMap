Text: "A place tailor made for Kings and armies, centuries ago, full of drafty spaces\
  \ and narrow stairwells, the gray stone castle stands guard above secrets in the\
  \ chalky cliffs beneath it.  Dover castle, in England shelters ghosts of plots hiding\
  \ in ornate tapestries, while its stained glass windows distort and color sunlight\
  \ that tries to enter.  \nHuddled inside the miles of tunnels and catacombs below\
  \ the castle, it is the last thing I expected.  Despair!  \"Move quickly!  Go, now!'\
  \ a recorded voice commands urgently. Red lights flash. An air raid alarm screams.\
  \ I feel claustrophobic, wanting to run out of here, yet worried what will happen\
  \ next.  I scramble to keep up with the other visitors as they scurry toward the\
  \ next hand dug chamber.  \nWe had just seen France, as the fog lifted from the\
  \ English Channel, before entering the tunnels.  Belgium, the day before, where\
  \ thousands of soldiers rest in underground crypts and paths.  Before this visit,\
  \ I had not been aware so much of war and fighting happened underground.  Ignorant\
  \ youths then, enlisting soldiers couldn't know how dreadful and ignominious their\
  \ fighting and dying would be.  Their identities, now buried in Flanders Fields,\
  \ is \"Known Only to God\", inscribed on rows of white headstones. The blood that\
  \ covered the ground is long faded, though red poppies flash remembrance.\nMy tears\
  \ come, interrupted by raucous teens who had come to the war memorials by bus from\
  \ their high school.  Never introduced to sacrifice, they giggle and laugh, stupidly,\
  \ loudly twisting headstone words:  \"Here's a regiment from Sus-SEX!  Very funny!\"\
  \  My friend, Laura, a British army major, is angered, offended for the sensibilities\
  \ of ancestors.  She reprimands the young people, \"Behave with respect!\"  No teacher\
  \ or parent stepped up to teach them how to be decent.\nIf only the History taught\
  \ when I was a child was as real as it is in the places we are supposed to remember.\
  \  Who were they, who said, \"NO!\" to those who wanted to overpower and subjugate\
  \ entire countries? Unschooled sons and daughters took up arms.  Rare gifted leaders,\
  \ like Churchill and Pershing, led to victory.  \"Unknown\" soldiers rest under\
  \ white headstones, communicating stories even now with those who will listen.\n\
  Did the young people visiting Flanders Fields connect at all with the stories of\
  \ those whose bones reside there?  Their heros appear to be sly, deceptive media\
  \ distortions, and no-one teaches the truth of right and wrong. How will we learn?"
