Text: "My heart was beating so hard that I could practically hear it. The butterflies\
  \ in my stomach were feverishly flying. I wasn\u2019t sure if I was going to faint\
  \ or vomit, and my legs were tingling with anticipation and dread. Fight or flight\
  \ mode kicking in, I did what any sane person would do. \n\nI jumped off the bridge.\
  \ \n\nFeeling suffocated by the stench of Corporate America, I had a craving for\
  \ adventure so bad it hurt. So, for my 32nd birthday I traveled to the other side\
  \ of the world to hurl myself off the world\u2019s highest commercial bungee bridge.\
  \ Was I having a pre-midlife crisis? Maybe. This was my first international travel\
  \ experience. What the heck am I doing? What I didn\u2019t know was that this trip\
  \ would change the direction of my whole life and the beauty of South Africa wouldn\u2019\
  t be found in my itinerary.\n\nWhile I was off watching Penguins waddle at Boulder\u2019\
  s Beach and hiking Table Mountain, the village of Knysna was being destroyed by\
  \ devastating wildfires. 10,000 people were displaced from their homes. Strong feelings\
  \ of selfishness rose up from my core. How can I be enjoying South Africa so much\
  \ while thousands of people just lost everything they had?\n\nDriving along the\
  \ Garden Route, ashes were sprinkling to the ground like snowflakes and all that\
  \ was green a week ago was now a crisp black shadow. Smaller fires were popping\
  \ up everywhere due to the wind. Gawking from the comfort of our tour van, our guide\
  \ started driving toward a cloud of smoke and flames. With no hesitation in his\
  \ voice, he said, \u201CWe have to try to help. Here we don\u2019t ask questions\
  \ when people need help. We just help each other no matter what the circumstance\
  \ is.\u201D We exited our van and walked toward a wildfire. Was I nervous? Definitely.\
  \ Scared? Oddly, no. I witnessed the beauty of South Africa that day, not in the\
  \ burnt trees, but in the selflessness of the people. Strangers helping strangers\
  \ is a beautiful thing to witness and be a part of.  \n\nFeeling as vulnerable as\
  \ a naked child, I stood at the edge of Bloukran\u2019s Bridge the next day. 708\
  \ feet high and attached to a cord, I (not so) gracefully fell forward into the\
  \ open air. While soaring freely, I let go of everything. All my insecurities, self-doubts,\
  \ and fears were left on that bridge and I knew I had to search for that altruistic\
  \ purpose that I had when walking toward that wildfire.  I said good-bye to Corporate\
  \ America a month later all because South Africa pushed me over a bridge and instead\
  \ of falling, I decided to fly."
