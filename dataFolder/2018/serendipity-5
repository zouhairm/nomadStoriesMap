Text: "In the summer of 2014, I was selected to be a part of an exchange program to\
  \ Germany. I had been on international trips before, I had even been selected for\
  \ a different exchange program before, but never did I visit another country to\
  \ find myself another family. \nVisiting a place can be an extremely different experience\
  \ when you do it through the eyes of a local. From living in a regular German household,\
  \ attending school, walking on cobbled stone streets of Lubeck with new found friends,\
  \ going grocery shopping to visiting the Parliament in Berlin, I tasted life in\
  \ Germany as a local. \nIn the beginning, I felt like an outsider. I was asked to\
  \ be ready by 8:21 am so we could catch the bus to school at 8:27 am. I didn\u2019\
  t understand why they didn\u2019t round it off. When I woke up the next morning,\
  \ I observed everyone moving around the house very systematically to get everything\
  \ done. Their love for discipline was impeccable. The first couple of days I found\
  \ it a little hard to get used to this way of living but from the third day on,\
  \ I found myself ready to leave the house at 8:21 am. Unknowingly, their system\
  \ became a part of me. \nOne afternoon I sat with my host father, we spoke about\
  \ the Neuengamme concentration camp which was a painful reminder of their brutal\
  \ history. I visited the camps like a normal tourist, learnt about the place and\
  \ left. Then, he told me about his father who was a part of the war and the kind\
  \ of excruciating things his family faced. That day, I realized the power of empathy\
  \ as my eyes filled up with tears. The pain of their history was still so fresh\
  \ in all their minds because this scar was relatively very recent. \nOn another\
  \ evening, my host mother and I decided to take a walk down her favorite park and\
  \ sit by a small lakeside cafeteria to celebrate the pleasant weather over a glass\
  \ of wine. She told me how she always wanted a daughter and having me around was\
  \ satisfying that wish. I wasn\u2019t just falling in love with the city but also\
  \ its people, how was I going to get myself to say goodbye?\nFinally, it was time\
  \ to leave and I could sense the sadness of my departure looming in the air. My\
  \ host family and I said our bittersweet goodbyes. At the bus stop, I felt a sneeze\
  \ coming and as soon as I sneezed, I heard my entire host family and another stranger\
  \ say \u201Cgesundheit\u201D in unison which is German for a wish of good health\
  \ for someone who just sneezed. Suddenly, I didn\u2019t feel like an outsider anymore.\
  \ Unfortunately, it was time to go home."
