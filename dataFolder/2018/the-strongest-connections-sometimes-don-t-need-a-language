Text: "Myself along with my two comrades had started off for the Chadar trek in the\
  \ region of Ladakh,Indian Himalayas with the motive of having a glimpse of the slow\
  \ clad Himalaya\u2019s pretty much resembling the color of a vanilla ice cream due\
  \ to the golden sun rays, filled with ice-sheets, the occasional early flower peeping\
  \ through, the roar of the nearby River bounding over rocks, we reached our base\
  \ camp.\nCordial \u201CNamaste\u2019s!\u201D greeted us, and just as I threw my\
  \ rucksack alongside one Bed and was about to sleep, I heard loud barking from below\
  \ the bed. The dog was possibly upset because of the way I threw my rucksack and\
  \ disturbed him off his sound sleep!\nLater I went to Birju(the camp caretaker)\
  \ to confirm regarding the Old Bhairav temple which laid its base on the topmost\
  \ tip of the mountain. Although risky and not officially open I had made my mind\
  \ to visit it as I left without informing anyone about the same to avoid debate.\n\
  Started with climbing the steep slope, clambering over boulders, scrambling across\
  \ loose stones I was soon lost, and decided to opt out and go back. But, I had lost\
  \ the trail back to where I started from!\nI made attempts to locate my exact credentials\
  \ but all in vain, until I saw a dog barking incessantly! I knew it that this was\
  \ the siren of help having arrived for me, I could see Tom rushing towards me with\
  \ his tongue hanging out!\nI don\u2019t know if it was some weird connection or\
  \ his maternal instincts, but the fact that he came looking out for me meant a lot\
  \ to me!\nTom started walking in one direction and I followed him like any disciplined\
  \ student would. Tom kept on walking with aplomb while turning back to ensure that\
  \ I was there.\nSooner we reached the guys, clicked some pictures at the sunset\
  \ point, and I was filled with a void as I knew that the experiences that I have\
  \ had during this trek were cherished memories! \nSitting beside the bonfire, I\
  \ could see the furball in Tom sitting at the other end of the bonfire, lost in\
  \ thoughts, he was looking very calm unlike my first impression of him early this\
  \ morning.\nMy hand went on to get my camera to capture this look of him, but I\
  \ did not because some moments like these are meant to stay just in your memory!\
  \ Some connections formed over a short period leave a lasting impact, and yes it\
  \ was then that I realized that this void of leaving Tom there was the most painful\
  \ one that I was carrying back.\nI returned to my diary, as I penned down:\n\u201C\
  Tom, you\u2019re the Best buddy!!!.Stay blessed!!.\u201D"
