Text: My first solo trip to GOA, I usually plan trip to GOA with my friends which
  ends up with no one. I had an marriage to attend in Goa, so I came 3 days earlier
  to explore GOA. It was my first solo travel in train from Kerala to GOA, met amazing
  people while traveling to Goa. After reaching Goa my first aim was to cover as many
  places in Goa in 3 days span. How can I start a trip without having an Pint beer
  and chill near the beaches. Goa is all about food, old buildings, Churches, mixed
  cultures and Beaches,  For a first timer like me it's Always challenging to live
  in a different place which is far miles away from your hometown. I started traveling
  to North Goa which is famous for Beaches and monuments, it was strange people were
  staring at me because I was the only one traveling with an selfie stick and taking
  selfies around. There were places I got stuck and dint know how to come back, but
  it's all part of our journey. Finished North and South Goa within 2 day's and 3
  Rd day attended the lavish Goan wedding had fun. Love the people in goa, so welcoming
