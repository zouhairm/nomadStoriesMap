Text: "I\u2019d set out into the night donning my backpacking best: borrowed lipstick\
  \ and a mildly wrinkled black sweater. My mission: to find love on New Year\u2019\
  s Eve in Prague. It\u2019d been a lonely few weeks of solo travel, and frankly,\
  \ I was restless. But now I was frozen. \n\nJaws slightly agape, my companions and\
  \ I stared at the kangaroo climbing a ladder propped up against the John Lennon\
  \ Wall, humming \u201CAuld Lang Syne\u201D. \n\n\u201CPaint with me!\u201D he beckoned,\
  \ sweeping a paw towards his partner who came hustling around the corner, arms stuffed\
  \ with more paint supplies, bundled up against Prague\u2019s first snow of the season,\
  \ and, by default, the year.\n\nWe were immobilized by absurdity of the situation.\
  \ After escaping the drunkenly gyrating masses that had infested the city\u2019\
  s night clubs, we\u2019d wandered across the Charles Bridge, ears ringing from the\
  \ fireworks and incessant bass. Though secretly I was longing to be in the arms\
  \ of some hunky Australian or dashing Czech, I was content with my company. Camilla,\
  \ the Brazilian, had never seen snow before. Taylor, the Chinese, had never tasted\
  \ alcohol before. I, the American, had never seen the John Lennon wall before. \n\
  \nNone of us had seen a man in a full kangaroo costume singing and painting at 3:00\
  \ AM.\n\nThe spell eventually broke and we joined them. We painted flowers, peace\
  \ signs, and hearts. We wrote quotes about new beginnings. We learned the kangaroo\
  \ was the mascot of their company, Quido The Kangaroo, which runs segway tours.\
  \ \n\n\u201CSo, why are you painting this late at night?\u201D Taylor finally asked.\n\
  \n\u201CBecause we love to paint!\u201D \n\n\u201CAnd why are you in costume?\u201D\
  \n\n\u201CBecause we love kangaroos!\u201D \n\nWhen our hands got too cold, they\
  \ invited us into their warehouse, where they were having a party. Three old couches\
  \ were clustered around a space heater. I squeezed between two men who, based on\
  \ their attire and odor, were homeless. It was clear our hosts had invited everyone.\
  \ They told stories, asked us for ours, and freely distributed beer. I sipped mine\
  \ pensively, dazed by alcohol and awed by our hosts.  They were marvelous people,\
  \ doing things simply because it brought them joy, no matter how ridiculous. And\
  \ then they shared that joy any lost soul who happened to wander by. \n\nCamilla\
  \ was dozing on Taylor\u2019s shoulder. The kangaroo had shed his costume and held\
  \ a homeless man\u2019s hands as he spoke about his children. Earlier in the evening,\
  \ I\u2019d had a goal: to find love on New Year\u2019s Eve. And though it didn\u2019\
  t come with a kiss at midnight, I undoubtedly found it."
