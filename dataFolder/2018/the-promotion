Text: "\"A bartender from Canada, I wanted to learn from every place I traveled so\
  \ I could open the best restaurant I could. My family and friends had told me how\
  \ hard it would be but no one could have warned me of what actually was around the\
  \ corner.\" Spoke the young man as he thought back to how he got where he was; an\
  \ events manager for a catering company and Manager of a Cocktail bar.\nHe gently\
  \ touched his side where he had had his ribs broken half a year ago. \n\"So much\
  \ can happen in such little time. You just have to make the best of it.\" \nHe turned\
  \ to smile at a young woman sitting in the corner of the bar. She had long brown\
  \ hair down to the small of her waist. She smiled back before sipping on her gin\
  \ and tonic.\n\"Have you traveled before this?\" Asked the man conducting the interview.\n\
  The young man cocked his eyebrow before continuing.\n\" I started in Japan, that's\
  \ where I caught the bug. Soon I was in France studying wines and brandy, vermouth\
  \ and all sorts of fortified wine. Partying in Spain came next but really, does\
  \ anyone really remember partying in Spain?\" He chuckled.\nBesides that New Zealand\
  \ was my first big trip, I hope one day to make it to Africa, Argentina, Italy or\
  \ Scotland. But only time will tell where I go next.\" He paused for a second to\
  \ take a look around.\n\"After all, so much can happen in such little amount of\
  \ time.\""
