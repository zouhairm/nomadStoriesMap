Text: "\u201CWould you like to visit our museum today?\u201D- a male voice with an\
  \ Italian accent asked.\n-\u201CWhat can we see there?\u201D\n-\u201CThere are some\
  \ paintings, costumes of flamenco dancers and music installation. Most importantly,\
  \ we have a flamenco performance that will start in 15 min. Let me see, if you still\
  \ can get in.\u201D\nThe ticket vendor dived into the computer, quickly clicking\
  \ the mouse. We looked at each other, and were about to walk away but in that moment\
  \ he announced that there were exactly two seats available, we agreed not knowing\
  \ what to expect.\nInside, suddenly, the light went out, and small spotlights lighted\
  \ up the stage. There were three chairs there, waiting for two singers and for a\
  \ guitar player. \nThe singers cleared their throats and the guitar player tuned\
  \ the guitar. Once everyone was ready they looked at each other, nodded, cried out\
  \ something hardly recognizable in Spanish, and the music flew into the room. It\
  \ was a rhythm and voice calling for a dancer to appear.  A woman who wore a bright\
  \ red dress with many ruffles made her way, stretching legs at every step. In the\
  \ middle of the stage she stopped, and turned around to make her face visible. She\
  \ was around forty, wearing scarlet lipstick, with slicked back black hair and a\
  \ rose flower hairpin. The music had quiet down, she stepped on the wooden floor\
  \ of the stage, slightly lifted up her dress and made a hollow sound that popped\
  \ out of her heels. Everyone froze.\nThe singers started clapping their hands, tapping\
  \ the floor. They turned their black smoldering eyes on her. I felt a chill run\
  \ down my spine. The voices of the singers tugged on the deepest layers of my soul.\
  \ The flamenco dancer snapped her fingers, curved her well-defined back, smoothly\
  \ stroking the air by her flexible hands. Her face shriveled into a mask of pain,\
  \ so each muscle was telling a story of her unrequited love. Suddenly, her mood\
  \ changed, from sadness to madness, and the next minute she broke into a dance so\
  \ desperately as if she would die on the devil\xB4s bed. Her forehead was covered\
  \ with sweat, but she danced anyway.  Finally, she stopped, caught her breath, grabbed\
  \ her dress and ran away.\nMy eyes watered. I could not believe it was just a dance.\
  \ I was about to die there with her on the stage. I was amazed how much she loved\
  \ her craft, how exhaustedly she dissolved in the music and danced until the last\
  \ drop. \nThat moment I thought: It doesn\u2019t matter where me meet our maker,\
  \ what matters is how, and what we leave behind."
