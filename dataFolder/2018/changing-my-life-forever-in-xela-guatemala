Text: "It is 4:30 in the morning, the air biting and cold. I fumble through my torn\
  \ jacket in search of matches to light the stove for myself and my fellow trekkers.\
  \ The unpleasantries of cold, wet hands and a 3:00am start time are about to pay\
  \ off. This was the final day of a three day trek through the Guatemalan highlands\
  \ and, while it was not the first time I had lead the trek the payoff was just as\
  \ special as ever. In the distant darkness I could see a small spurt of blood red\
  \ light, less of a flash and more of an eerie glow. It was lava from the incredibly\
  \ active Fuego Volcano outside of Antigua Guatemala. Fuego\u2019s eruption was just\
  \ the beginning. Soon the sun rose revealing the entire Volcano chain. Volcanos\
  \ Fuego, Agua, Acatanango, Atitlan, San Pedro, and the beheaded Toliman were uncovered\
  \ from the starry blanket of night. Impressive yes, but the real treat is an illuminated\
  \ lake Atitlan, A massive lake located in the crater of an ancient super volcano\
  \ where famed author Ernest Hemingway was known to enjoy a drink or two, containing\
  \ enough Mayan, Spanish, and modern Genocidal history to leave travelers in a sense\
  \ of awe and profound respect for the region and its people. I thought to myself\
  \ with a grin on my face and joy in my heart \u201CThis is the last thing I expected?\u201D\
  . It was all thanks to Quetzaltrekkers, the biggest anomaly in community driven\
  \ volunteer work in Guatemala and maybe in the entire world.\n\nQuetzaltrekkers\
  \ (QT) is a 100% volunteer trekking organization based in Quetsaltenago (Xela) that\
  \ has been taking people trekking and climbing throughout Guatemala for more than\
  \ 20 years starting at  the end of the Guatemalan Civil war (1960-1996). Run out\
  \ of the back of the sketchiest hostel in Xela, (you have to knock on a seemingly\
  \ hidden metal door and walk through the owners kitchen to get to the rooms and\
  \ QT office.). QT seeks to live up to its mantra \u201CHike Volcanoes, Help Kids\u201D\
  . When I say 100% volunteer I mean it. There are no directors, no coordinators,\
  \ no boss, no hierarchy, no paid staff, just volunteers (3 month minimum). It shouldn't\
  \ work, everything we know about business tells us that something like QT can\u2019\
  t work. But it does, and has been for more than 20 years. \n\nI had been advised\
  \ by a traveler in a hostel to go on a trek with the organization while I was in\
  \ Chiapas. I signed up to do a 3 day trek to Lake Atitlan with them. After hiking\
  \ through indigenous K'iche' farm land for two days I asked if I could be a guide\
  \ too. They said yes."
