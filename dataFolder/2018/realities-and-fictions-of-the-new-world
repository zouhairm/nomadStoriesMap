Text: "This trip starts with an empty appartment, closing the door of our home for\
  \ the last time, family and friends hugging us and my partner's hand in mine. This\
  \ is the trip of our life. Together we enter a new world in which we lose sense\
  \ of time to set our clocks on the sun. With two backpacks, we leave Paris in the\
  \ snow and it might be the last European city we will visit in months, or years...\
  \ \nWith little knowledge of the first country we were heading to, we flew to Guatemala\
  \ City, where we learnt our first lessons in the tough Capital, which was not precisely\
  \ the right place to relax after travelling for more than thirty hours. If we had\
  \ read a good guide, we would have been to Antigua Guatemala straight from the airport\
  \ but it was worth the experience and every mistake is a lesson in the art of travelling.\
  \ We discovered a city filled with traffic and though we saw no real violence nor\
  \ felt no insecurity, we were shocked by the number of weapons, policemen and security\
  \ guards we would see all around us.\nSo then we choose to start our Guatemala trip\
  \ in the hot region of lake Izabal. Guatemala being a tropical country with two\
  \ coasts (one on the Pacific Ocean and one on the Caribbeans) and mountain peaks\
  \ higher than four thousand meters, it has a variety of climates. We prefered to\
  \ swin in its rivers and enjoy its hot waterfalls before hiking on its volcanos\
  \ and we enjoyed it like a huge spa, full of incredible people. We jumped from rocks\
  \ higher than we ever had and sailed down the \"Sweat River\" of R\xEDo Dulce to\
  \ the Caribbean town of Livingston, where we met a Catalan girl that lives in the\
  \ jungle with a Garifuna, a \"black Carib\" that took us to his beautiful homemade\
  \ wood house. There, we learned to fly, bouncing on ropes more than ten meter long\
  \ over the valley while admiring the view of the horizon on the sea and screaming\
  \ our joy in the most exotic languages. \nWe found the beach really dirty but it\
  \ seems like they clean it twice every year: for Christmas and Easter. The Guatemalan\
  \ Caribbean is not what you would expect. The sea is not turquoise and the sand\
  \ is not white. The landscape is abrupt and picturesque. The sand is full of plastic\
  \ but the wild life resists and thrives beautifully. Herons and pelicans dance over\
  \ the rising sun. The new light of the first hours of the day paint the sky and\
  \ its liquid mirror with shades of pink and orange that contrast with the dark shadows\
  \ of the tropical trees."
