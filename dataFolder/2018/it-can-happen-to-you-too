Text: "In April 2017, i was chosen to take part in a training course in Serbia. Well,\
  \ even now this seems to me like a fairy tale. I really did not expect that i would\
  \ be chosen.\nAfter learning that me and two others had been picked to represent\
  \ Greece for the course, i immediately started to pack my staff. I was so excited,\
  \ no worries, all the expenses covered, free training course and, the most important\
  \ thing for me, another country ready to be explored. At the airport, i could not\
  \ think of any disadvantages this trip could have. I was sure that it would be a\
  \ nice, prosperous experience for me. \nWell, i am always trying to foresee the\
  \ bad and be prepared for it, before it happens. In this case it just did not work\
  \ out. I was having fun with my new Greek friends that had not travelled by airplane\
  \ before. \"Imagine the plane crushes and falls down.\", i kept scaring them, while\
  \ i was laughing. Well, the plane did not crush at all and we had a beautiful flight,\
  \ but things did not go as smoothly as we thought they would go. \nAfter we landed,\
  \ we took a city bus to the centre of Belgrade. The airport was quite far, so the\
  \ bus had to go through the highway. No stops, just a free, uninterrupted highway.\
  \ \nInside the bus, my two friends were sitting at the last two seats that face\
  \ the back window of the bus, while i was standing up ninety degrees to them, holding\
  \ a stanchion. As i said before, i am always trying to find emergency exits and\
  \ what to do in a case of fire or accident, but that time i just did not. While\
  \ we were talking about how this course would be, i felt something like a pull.\
  \ The next thing i remember is some screams and the last one a terrible noise like\
  \ crushing windows. All happened in just a blink. And yes, we had a crush. I was\
  \ unable to hold the pen and i really blasted off about two metres long at the corridor\
  \ of the bus. My friends did not hurt, except for experiencing some shock, while\
  \ my arm was hurt badly. Broken glasses were everywhere. Fortunately,none of the\
  \ passengers wounded seriously. As a result, another bus came to pick us up, but\
  \ it was completely like a can with some wheels under it. Of course, we did not\
  \ got into it and we called the police. They brought us a mini van and guess what.\
  \ We almost had a crush again. My friends were crying all along the journey to the\
  \ centre. I never expected that an accident could happen to me. \nIn the whole duration\
  \ of the course my arm was aching, but in the end none of us regretted that trip."
