Text: "Feeling a little bleary eyed but excited after a long flight, I took an Uber\
  \ to one of the few dispensaries in Los Angeles that has managed to get a temporary\
  \ license for the sale of recreational marijuana. Not everyone managed to get one\
  \ on 1 January 2018. I got out of my ride and joined the back of a small queue.\
  \ \u201CHow long do you think this will take?\u201D I asked a guy in a black t-shirt\
  \ who looked like a staff member. \u201CAbout an hour from where you are now? We\u2019\
  re going as fast as we can ma\u2019am.\u201D \u201CNo worries. Some people have\
  \ been waiting for this for decades, so what\u2019s another hour?\u201D I said.\
  \ I subsequently discovered that some of those waiting in line had medical cards,\
  \ but still wanted to queue up to experience the freedom of full legalisation. In\
  \ its own way, I found this to be an oddly humbling political act, since medical\
  \ card holders pay less tax and there was no queue at all at the entrance reserved\
  \ for medicinal purchases. I got chatting to those waiting with me, most of whom\
  \ were young men of various ethnicities. They were all there because they wanted\
  \ to be among the first to purchase cannabis in the new legal market. They were\
  \ a bit hazy on matters of regulation and policy but more than happy to enlighten\
  \ me about the benefits of various products and strains, and their respective levels\
  \ of THC. Cannabis, they reported, helped relieve all manner of ailments, including\
  \ pain, anxiety, and sleep problems. But time and again, they simply pointed out\
  \ that \u201CAlcohol makes me do crazy shit and weed just relaxes me.\u201D The\
  \ front of the dispensary was a waiting area where customers went through a quick\
  \ registration process. The product display area was crowd controlled so that everyone\
  \ was served by their own \u2018budtender.\u2019 I overheard another customer \u2013\
  \ a gruff late middle-aged man with the physique of a manual labourer \u2013 tell\
  \ his budtender that he \u201Chadn\u2019t bought weed since the \u201970s\u201D\
  \ and ask for a recommendation. The stocky, tattooed budtender pulled out some pre-rolls\
  \ and advised in a soft, authoritative voice that these were his personal favourites.\
  \ A few decades ago someone like this might have been a drug dealer scuttling from\
  \ the law feeling indecent and ashamed. Now he is a cannabis sommelier, offering\
  \ his expertise on taste, potency, and sensation. I could tell that he was proud\
  \ of his knowledge and passionate about his job."
