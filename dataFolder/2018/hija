Text: "San Juan moved in boisterous clusters. An iguana sunned in the middle of the\
  \ road separating our hotel from the casino across the street. The iguana stretched\
  \ against the brilliant shine of the sun, flattening and making himself wide across\
  \ the dark macadam. Cars swerved around him, the proud king of the highway. We adjusted\
  \ our sunglasses as we exited the casino. A woman with blonde hair screeched, \"\
  Gringa!\" as she passed us from a car swerving around the king. A smile stretched\
  \ between my freckled cheeks. I had hit $500 on a slot machine after playing $10.\
  \ After cashing out, $490 up, my friend, Sean, and I decided it was time to go spend\
  \ my winnings in Old San Juan. \n\nCerulean tiles marked the pathway along old San\
  \ Juan's shops. I passed a Coach store and found a touristy dive selling shirts\
  \ and apparel. The perfect place to shop since I planned on using a considerable\
  \ chunk of my money at the Bacardi distillery later in the trip. Roberto, a large\
  \ man with a yellow striped polo and dark hair, emerged from behind the counter.\
  \ A vibrant display of tees with a variety of snarky sayings hung on the wall in\
  \ the dimly lit shop behind him.\n\nWe initiated our transaction and Roberto pulled\
  \ a couple of shirts and a hat from the wall.\n\n\"So where are you from?\" Robert\
  \ hummed as he worked.\n\n\"Pittsburgh. We're grad students here for two weeks for\
  \ a travel writing seminar,\" either Sean or I answered. \n\nWe continued with small\
  \ talk. Eventually Roberto paused and asked, \"You must be Puerto Rican.\"\n\n\"\
  No. But my mom is a Jewish princess from Queens.\"\n\nRoberto's belly shook, \"\
  Close enough. My wife is in Yonkers visiting family.\"\n\n\"I'm originally from\
  \ Reading, Pennsylvania.\"\n\n\"Get out! I got a cousin in Reading!\"\n\nAs we realized\
  \ how small the world was, Roberto finished the order.\n\nI pulled out my Visa when\
  \ Roberto cut in, \"We're cash only.\"\n\n\"That's OK. Where's the closest ATM?\"\
  \n\nRoberto stared out the door. \"I'll take you. You have to be careful on side\
  \ streets. It's not safe for you.\" \n\nDusk colored the evening sky. \n\nSean hesitated\
  \ and followed behind us as we turned from the blue tile to cracked brick. A man\
  \ approached Roberto. My high school Spanish only made out a few phrases, \"No.\
  \ Mi hija. No. No.\"\n\nAfter we made it to the ATM, we shuffled back to the shop.\
  \ \n\n\"He wanted to buy you,\" Roberto shook his head as he closed the till. He\
  \ pulled keys from his pocket. \"I'll drive you both back to your hotel.\"\n\nDaughter.\
  \ He called me his daughter."
