Text: "The light behind the darkness\n\u201CThe last thing I expected\u201D this is\
  \ from when I was telling my mother how my day turned from sweet to sour in a matter\
  \ of seconds. My day started off on high note and my brother was the reason for\
  \ my happiness because he promised to lend me his car. I was feeling adventurous\
  \ like captain Kirk in star wars and his car was going to be my USS Enterprise.\
  \ I was going to manufacture an adventure and in my mind it was going to end like\
  \ another episode of the 1980\u2019s sitcom The goonies.\nI just passed my driver\u2019\
  s license and wanted to take full of advantage of this newly acquired freedom. In\
  \ School I was a awkward child with nothing interesting to tell unlike my friend\
  \ Siviwe who lives in Nyanga which has the highest death rate in South Africa. Siviwe\
  \ would tell us tales of a guy called Max who was a gun slinger who went around\
  \ killing people for little to no reason. We would sit in a circle with him in the\
  \ middle looking and listening to him like lost puppies.  He spoke of Max like as\
  \ if he was another character in a Mafia movie and we all loved Max even though\
  \ we never saw him. I wanted to be like Max and we all did me and all those who\
  \ were listening to Siviwe speak. \nI took my lent USS enterprise to meet the legend\
  \ himself: Max, the plan was to meet at Siviwe\u2019s house me and my two friends,\
  \ leave the car at Siviwe\u2019s house then go to where Max usually hangs out so\
  \ that we could see him in action. I could safely say this is the worst decision\
  \ I\u2019ve ever made and I blame it on peer pressure and teenage hood.  We took\
  \ the car from Wynberg where I lived which a suburban community then picked up my\
  \ two friends: Mzi and Themba.\nWe got to Nyanga and our first mistake was assuming\
  \ Max\u2019s home had a car garage because it didn\u2019t and the car was exposed.\
  \ We went to the car wash and saw him, He was not I was expecting an average looking\
  \ person with nothing distinguishable about him. The last thing I expected happened;\
  \ two police cars appeared out of nowhere rushing towards the car wash and I was\
  \ sure their target was Max. In my mind this was going to be another hijack story\
  \ scenario where the bad guys bribe the police. The opposite happened Max tried\
  \ to run when the police pulled over, when they started chasing him. \nHe tried\
  \ to pull a gun and was shot on the chest twice. It was so terrifying and disappointing\
  \ because that was the first time I even heard gun shots that close and disappointing\
  \ because our idol died so pathetically."
