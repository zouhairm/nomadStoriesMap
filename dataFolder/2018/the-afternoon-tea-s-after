Text: "\u201CMam?..\u201D \u2014 he was looking into my eyes, probably waiting for\
  \ the answer. This man\u2019s look contained nothing but pain and despair. He kept\
  \ my hand, and it was weird how it didn\u2019t feel obtrusive. Words I should have\
  \ said seconds ago got lost and never came. Thoughts kept swirling in my head, but\
  \ I couldn\u2019t make a sentence out of them.\nWith inaudible gibberish, I slowly\
  \ took my hand and deserted. I moved fast but there was no reason for it: he was\
  \ not going to follow me or throw curses in my back. He was not going to beg. I\
  \ knew somehow he wasn\u2019t that kind of man.\nAfar Big Ben suggested it was 12\
  \ o\u2019clock. Somehow sense of time abandoned me.\nI could have helped, but I\
  \ didn\u2019t.\n\u201CIdiot!\u201D \u2014 I shouted and halted. Tourists in fancy\
  \ hats started twisting their heads, attempting to find the noise source. Though\
  \ night time, Westminster Bridge was filled with people. I leaned over, pretending\
  \ to enjoy Thames\u2019 view. My tears were finally good to go.\nWhat is wrong with\
  \ you, London? Why aren\u2019t you as I have imagined? Carefree, majestic, unfamiliar\
  \ with problems, faced by less developed countries, including my own\u2026\nThis\
  \ man looked completely lost.\nI was getting lost in conjectures: what if I was\
  \ his only chance? What if he felt he could share his trouble with me?.. Hunger\
  \ and pride are not the best combination after all. A need to ask for help was the\
  \ catalyst of this man\u2019s desperate look. I saw it in his yes, but only figured\
  \ it out now.\nThames gradually took shape: my eyes were dry. I took off, quickly\
  \ repeating my path on the way back. I was sorting out the options. If he\u2019\
  d refuse to have dinner with me, I should at least find a way to give him a hot\
  \ soup and slip some banknotes between the napkins.\nThe woman at the counter showed\
  \ no sign of noticing my worn-out look and puffy eyes. Tonelessly, she listed the\
  \ specials and asked what the young lady'd like. Her British accent made me feel\
  \ like a layman. I ordered a bunch of everything, vainly trying to copy the local\
  \ manner of speech.  Was it scorn in her eyes?..\nIn addition to anxiety, I was\
  \ now accompanied by a fatal smell of fries and curry. In London any cuisine fusion\
  \ seemed to be possible. I was afraid to spoil the food so wasn\u2019t in a hurry\
  \ first time that night. Noise and music were everywhere \u2014 city is alive even\
  \ at such a late time. Alcohol, dances, drugs... It\u2019s all so immaterial...\n\
  Tears welled up my eyes as I approached to the familiar alley. I kept going, but\
  \ there was nobody waiting for me."
