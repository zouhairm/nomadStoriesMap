Text: "I knew from the beginning that I didn\u2019t want my trips to only be about\
  \ visiting the fun, happy places. I didn\u2019t want to just filter out the bad\
  \ sides of history. That was why, on my first day in Cape Town, I hopped on the\
  \ ferry to Robben Island. I already knew some about apartheid in South Africa, but\
  \ I was not prepared for what I saw in that former prison. I also wasn\u2019t prepared\
  \ for Jama, my tour guide. \n He was a middle-aged man with that thick South African\
  \ accent that I adored. The first thing I noticed was that he had a strong resemblance\
  \ to Mandela himself, but what nearly stunned me speechless about Jama was when\
  \ he told us that he had been a prisoner at Robben Island for a decade. I told him\
  \ I would\u2019ve wanted to get as far away from this place as possible after that,\
  \ but he replied that he felt obligated to tell people first hand about this brutal\
  \ part of his country\u2019s history.\n Every tour stop was shocking, like the quarry\
  \ where the prisoners had to work (which looked uninviting to say the least) and\
  \ the barren, meager graveyard where prisoners were buried. What nearly brought\
  \ me to tears, though, was the building that served as the prison itself. \n Jama\
  \ led us around the maximum-security prison turned museum, explaining as we went.\
  \ He went into great detail with each area, but did so in a way that never lost\
  \ my interest. The fact that he\u2019d been a prisoner there meant he could give\
  \ us facts and details that others couldn\u2019t, like that the prisoners had to\
  \ shower with seawater, or describing the pitiful-sounding food that they were given.\
  \ \n The tour ended at the cell where Nelson Mandela had spent eighteen years of\
  \ his life. Looking at the tiny cell, the thin straw mat that he slept on, and the\
  \ metal plate that he ate so many unappetizing meals off of made me understand why\
  \ Mandela was so celebrated in this country. Just looking at the cell made me feel\
  \ claustrophobic, and I wasn\u2019t even inside.\n After the tour, I quickly came\
  \ up and asked for a picture with Jama. I wanted to remember the man who had made\
  \ my day so special. He seemed taken aback when I asked, but happily posed with\
  \ me for a few pictures. Then he looked at me and said something absolutely heart\
  \ wrenching. His voice broke slightly as he said, \u201CPeople almost never ask\
  \ for that.\u201D I gave him a hug and thanked him for the tour. As I rode the ferry\
  \ back to Cape Town, I told myself that I\u2019d never stop visiting places like\
  \ Robben Island, and I\u2019d never stop appreciating people like Jama."
