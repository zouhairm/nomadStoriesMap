Text: "Just say yes. It sounds so simple. But it often isn\u2019t. The decision to\
  \ make this my mantra however, has not only taken me on adventures I never dreamed\
  \ Id have, it has changed my perspective on life altogether.  What started as a\
  \ simple way for a newly single 38yo overweight woman with no social life, to meet\
  \ more people and make new friends, turned into way more than I ever considered.\
  \ I think the clincher, that moment you get to when you say to yourself \u2018How\
  \ far am I really going to take this?\u2019 arrived when I was asked by a man I\u2019\
  d never met if I\u2019d \u2018Join his team in Bali as an English Teacher\u2019\
  .I knew nothing at all about this man and his company.  My \u2018yes mantra\u2019\
  \ so far only related to simple things. \u2018Come paragliding with me\u2019, \u2018\
  Come camping with me\u2019 and \u2018Want to learn Latin dancing with me?\u2019\
  .  The mantra had enabled me to broaden my social circle and totally succeeded in\
  \ meeting the original aim.  I had already had some adventures in my own hometown\
  \ that\u2019s for sure.  But this was a whole new level.  The mantra had worked\
  \ so far, but how far was I willing to test my winning theory? Keeping true to my\
  \ mantra would involve quitting my \u2018perfectly good job\u2019 and selling what\
  \ little I did get from my divorce.  It would mean leaving everyone I knew and loved\
  \ to live on an island I knew very little about, doing a job I\u2019d never done.\
  \  In fact, my two trips to Bali was all that I\u2019d ever had stamped in my passport.\
  \  My whole life\u2019s travel experience revolved around a couple of five star\
  \ getaways. That\u2019s it. \nIn the space of a week I signed a years contract,\
  \ quit my job and told my family and friends. In that order.  I figured if I was\
  \ going to do this, I was going to go all in.  So I sold my car and just about everything\
  \ else too.  Amidst whispers of me having a midlife crisis or mental breakdown tickets\
  \ were purchased and a small house I\u2019d never seen was secured to rent. It was\
  \ definitely happening. I said goodbye to all I\u2019d ever known and boarded the\
  \ plane. \nIts been 5 years since that decision and I've never looked back.  I have\
  \ mainly lived on my island of contradictions during this time, interspersed with\
  \ backpacks to other parts of Asia. I ride in the organised chaos of Bali traffic\
  \ everyday. I live amongst locals. I have no pool, air-conditioning or fancy facilities.\
  \ I've gone from a 5 star city girl to the simple life. I flung myself head first\
  \ into a whole new world filled with rituals, black magic and beautiful people.\
  \ I had caught the travel bug."
