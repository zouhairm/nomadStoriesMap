Text: "There's something oddly soothing in the thudding and the thumping of a chicken\
  \ bus along a windy Guatemalan road. Or at least, so I try to justify having just\
  \ absently stepped off without my wallet.\nI realise quickly and launch off in a\
  \ noisy, sweaty, desperate pursuit - but the souped-up bus is already turning the\
  \ next corner; and if the driver sees me through the dust his Monster-style wheels\
  \ are kicking up, he certainly doesn't seem to consider stopping. I'm doubled over,\
  \ spent, gasping for air, when a lone black motorcycle cruises into view.\nIts young\
  \ rider pulls up to me, inquisitive, and coolly nods throughout my flustered spurt\
  \ of not-quite-Spanish. 'Tranquillo', he smiles, but wastes no time in leaping valiantly\
  \ to action. He revs a tight 180, helps me scramble on, and before I've even caught\
  \ my breath we're underway. The chase is on!\nClutching for dear life, I become\
  \ convinced the bus's jangling icon clusters must be working: for an antique school\
  \ bus with a flashy paint job, it sure is moving at unearthly speed. My driver shows\
  \ no mercy on the throttle, yet with each new bend the teasing garish purple streak\
  \ stays just as far ahead of us.\nIn fact, the chase continues for so long that\
  \ our frenzied start relaxes to a kind of rhythm. I learn to lean into the corners,\
  \ he learns his way around my clumsy Spanish syntax. We talk about our families\
  \ and our studies and our travels. By the time we finally hail down the bus, whose\
  \ bemused passengers readily partake in a dramatic repatriation of my wallet, we've\
  \ covered some serious territory - comparing notes on the impact of endangered species\
  \ and the best new direction for his band.\nHe doesn't let me pay for gas, which\
  \ by now we're nearly out of, but I'm at least able to shout my rescuer an ice cream\
  \ to express my gratitude. We eat them by the pump, savouring the victory and spent\
  \ adrenalin that has us laughing as the drips run down our fingers.\nMy second arrival\
  \ at Finca El Para\xEDso that day is much more graceful than the first - I step\
  \ down from the burnished bike with Jos\xE9's help, and wave farewell as he rides\
  \ away. A short while later, floating in a deep, clear jungle pool as thermal water\
  \ cascades on me from above, I'm awestruck by the spectacle I travelled here to\
  \ see: to swim in a hot waterfall is an incredible, unique experience; something\
  \ I already know that I'll never forget. And yet - I smile, as the steam rises around\
  \ me - it's a distant second for the most memorable experience I've had today."
