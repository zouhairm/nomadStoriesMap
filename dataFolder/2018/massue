Text: "Travelling solo has its perks but overtime we crave connection. Many people\
  \ find this amongst fellow travellers they meet at hostels or bars, but I was after\
  \ a bit more of the local flavour. So I opened Grindr. Being a traveller on dating\
  \ apps you always get a lot of attention from the local community. Striking up a\
  \ conversation with Massue I quickly discovered it was his day off and he was keen\
  \ to show me what Bangkok has to offer. \n\nDespite getting a tad lost on my way\
  \ to meet him, thanks to a little blip in my mobile data coverage, Massue spotted\
  \ me and came over to say hi. Once the formalities were out the way, it was down\
  \ to the tough decisions, where to go. I had already experienced the Grand Palace\
  \ and Wat Pho, so I suggested the Snake Farm, this was met with a quick \u2018what?\u2019\
  \ Confused, I explained that they were one of the leading anti-venom research facilities\
  \ in the world. Still a blank stare. I told him where it was located, and met with\
  \ a \u2018really?\u2019 Turns out he studied at a university just across the road\
  \ and had never seen or heard of the Snake Farm. So we walked there to see if the\
  \ Internet lied or local knowledge was blissfully unaware. BOOM. Massue\u2019s mind\
  \ was blown wide open. His realisation that he studied right across the road from\
  \ an institute housing some of the world\u2019s most venomous snakes caused us to\
  \ both crumble in hysterics. \n\nUpon composing ourselves and entering to see the\
  \ snake demonstration we discovered more about each other\u2019s cities and countries.\
  \ Coming from New Zealand where we have absolutely nothing dangerous, it was a surreal\
  \ experience for me to witness these beautiful creatures as much as it was for Massue\
  \ to comprehend how carefree we could be back home because of our lack of \u2018\
  vicious killers\u2019.  \n\nFrom one discovery about each other to another, and\
  \ from one tourist attraction to another. I explored the city with Massue over the\
  \ span of 2 weeks. We watched a Muay Thai match (his first time as well), we escaped\
  \ the typical bustle of Bangkok and headed inside the lung of Bangkok (Bang Kachao)\
  \ for a day, and even witnessed the funeral of King Bhumibol Adulyadej, amongst\
  \ many other adventures. I was even fortunate enough to experience the hospitality\
  \ of him letting me stay in his apartment for most of the time. \n\nAll good things\
  \ come to an end, but friendships like the one I have with Massue never do. Parting\
  \ ways we shared gifts, a hug and a kiss, and the promise to visit one another soon."
