Text: "\u201CEskimos. That is an interesting word.\u201D\n\nI shot Janet a startled\
  \ look. I realized that, unwittingly, of course, I had uttered something inappropriate.\
  \ \n\n\u201CThe native tribes here - they don\u2019t like to be called Eskimos.\
  \ Alaskans will do.\u201D\n\nJust then, the waitress came to my rescue and placed\
  \ plates of steaming reindeer sausages in front of us. One bite and I was lost in\
  \ the chewy texture of the richly peppered meat.  \n\nI looked at the white-haired\
  \ lady in front of me. She wore a pinstripe suite, with a maple broach on it, which\
  \ added to her aura of dignity.\n\n\u201CSo, do you travel frequently?\u201D I asked.\n\
  \n\u201COh, I make it a point to travel by the Aurora Winter every season. Sure,\
  \ you can catch the plane from Anchorage and be in Fairbanks in an hour, but, if\
  \ I take the train, then it becomes a mini-vacation\u201D she pipped.\n\nI couldn\u2019\
  t agree more. Postcard beauty graced the gigantic windows, as the train whizzed\
  \ through the Denali forest that was filled with silver trunk trees set aglow by\
  \ yellow golden leaves and stale chocolate mountains dusted with powdered sugar\
  \ snow. Mt. Denali, appeared, like a giant blob of whipped cream in the distance\
  \ and passengers craned their necks to get a view of \u201CThe Great One\u201D.\
  \ \n\nTo the last whisker of his neatly trimmed, reddish brown mustache, the ticket-collector\
  \ was the very embodiment of a tin soldier and as he passed our table, he gave us\
  \ a cursory nod.\n\n\u201CSo, why are you going to Fairbanks?\u201D\n\n\u201COh!\
  \ To meet my daughter, I plan to stay over the weekend and wood with her!\u201D\
  \ \n\nAt my quizzical expression, she raised both her hands and gestured as if she\
  \ were hitting a plate with a tong and said, \u201CTo wood. I plan to go into the\
  \ forest with her and chop some wood.\u201D \n\nShe added wistfully, \"I used to\
  \ really hunt, once. I have hunted bears, moose, mountain goats and sheep in my\
  \ time. But now, I no longer go up to the mountains to hunt. I do not want to be\
  \ known as the octogenarian who was stupid enough to go to the mountains and get\
  \ killed!\u201D I reflected on these words of wisdom with a growing sense of alienation.\
  \ \n\n\u201CNow I only hunt duck and grouse\u201D, she said somewhat dejectedly,\
  \ as if these were relatively lame game.\n\n\u201COh! But my daughters! All three\
  \ of them hunt,\u201D she said, her eyes brimming with pride. \n\n\u201CWe all hunt\
  \ in the summer, for whatever fills the freezer in the winter. It's what you do\
  \ to survive here\u201D, she shrugged her shoulders.\n\n\u201CWhat about you?\u201D\
  , she asked.\n\nI said, \u201CI am going to Fairbanks to hunt for some Northern\
  \ Lights.\u201D"
