Text: "I am from a small coal mining town in northern England. Everyone knows everyone,\
  \ no body leaves (for long). People are expected to live near by and stay within\
  \ the community.\n\nI had a good job, a loving family; and I found love in a kind,\
  \ caring guy.\n\nBut I knew this couldn't be it, surely this wasn't life? I was\
  \ successful in my career and relationship, but it just felt mediocre. Anxiety clung\
  \ on to me for years with no previous rhym or reason; and I couldn't seem to shake\
  \ it off. Life is a precious gift, I wanted so much more from it.\n\nSo one day\
  \ I decided I was leaving the small town, my success, my material things, my family\
  \ and my home behind. Luckily that kind caring guy decided to come with me. \n\n\
  I owned a horse, along with two cars, a trailer and a mountain of accessories to\
  \ go with them. It broke my heart to part with my horse, and still to this day I\
  \ dream of her; but I had to make this sacrifice. I sold everything.\n\nSo where\
  \ to go? Let's start with the other side of the world. With enough money to put\
  \ a hefty deposit down on a house, we flew to Cairns north Australia, rented a camper\
  \ van and decided to drive the full length of The country and finish in Melbourne.\n\
  \nThe minute I landed I felt a positivite energy in me that had been waiting to\
  \ burst. Everyday I could feel the anxiety I'd carried my whole life leave my mind\
  \ and spirit. The hot air of Cairns filled eveypart of me and literally made me\
  \ warm.\n\nCairns blew me away. It was nothing I ever expected of Australia. I felt\
  \ like I was in Jurassic Park, and the fact you couldn't swim in the water for the\
  \ prehistoric reptiles that was in there emphasised that. The people are friendly\
  \ with so many stories. The landscape is breathtaking, and having the great barrier\
  \ reef at your door is an experience everyone should encounter.\n\nThis was only\
  \ the beginning and Australia was about to change my life forever ......."
