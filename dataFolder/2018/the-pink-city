Text: "\u201CShit! Shit!\u201D an old man calls my attention, pointing at something\
  \ on the ground. This time, my friend and I are exiting Hawa Mahal to meet Mohammad,\
  \ whom we see enjoying pani puri across the street. When I look down at what that\
  \ old man is pointing, I see this yellowish thing on my sneakers. \u201CDog shit,\u201D\
  \ he says, now sitting on his bare heels, seemingly assessing the \u201Cshit\u201D\
  \ problem before him. I thought, how is this seriously happening? He takes his pouch\
  \ which is tied around his waist and, from it, he pulls out a piece of cloth, a\
  \ bottle of water, a shoe polish, and then reaches out to wipe it off. \n\n\u201C\
  No!\u201D \n\n\u201COnly ten rupees.\u201D \n\nI turn my head to my friend and Mohammad\
  \ and some passersby who all seem to be watching closely what I would do next. Yes,\
  \ I want this shit off me, but I don\u2019t want this old man cleaning my shoes,\
  \ with him crouching on the ground while I just stand there in the middle of the\
  \ street, serviced this way like some sort of smug. So I give him ten rupees and\
  \ I walk away. When I approach Mohammad\u2019s auto-rickshaw, with my friend already\
  \ seated in, he maintains his tourist-friendly smile despite some debris of his\
  \ snack still stuck between his front teeth. For the rest of afternoon, he drives\
  \ us to other places-to-see around city and also to several handicraft stores he\u2019\
  s asked us to visit, likely because he gets kickbacks from them. When he learns\
  \ we visited the Taj, he tells us the story about the peafowls. Every Friday, when\
  \ the Taj opens exclusively for the mosque goers, two peafowls are said to roam\
  \ its grounds. Not many visitors have seen them, but to the few who have, they are\
  \ the reincarnations of their beloved Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal. \n\n\u201CWow!\
  \ Each Friday?\u201D I echo him in fascination\u2014it also fascinated me that the\
  \ jewelry store he\u2019d taken us to sold my friend a ring which tarnished after\
  \ two days."
