Text: "I still remember when I decided to go to Romania for the European Voluntary\
  \ Service. It was the year 2013 and I was full of dreams and expectations.I do not\
  \ remember how many times my family and friends told me that I was absolutely crazy,\
  \ that were going to rape me or things like this.Even my father, who always supports\
  \ my craziest ideas and decisions, told me that I was not going to be happy there.I\
  \ never told anyone how scared I was and though I did not want to believe that was\
  \ such a dangerous country, I decided to bring my worst and oversize clothes to\
  \ look fat and as poor as them.\n\nMy third contact with a local shocked me. How\
  \ a person without language skills could work in the train station of a country\
  \ capital. As I had no idea of Romanian yet, I tried with signs, pointing the railway\
  \ platforms, showing her my ticket and it finally worked. I sat down in front of\
  \ the platform and few seconds later,I was surrounded by about thirty children begging\
  \ me some money and food. Suddenly, a tall and skinny man began to drive them away,\
  \ kicking them.At first,I was angry until he told me that they were mafias which\
  \ asked for money while they tried to steal you.We were talking for three hours\
  \ and gave me a masterclass on survival which I still appreciate today. As the train\
  \ did not come, I asked him if he could accompany me to the responsible man to ask\
  \ about. It turns out that my train was leaving platform number one and was leaving\
  \ at that moment.I could not believe it and unnerved, called to the responsible\
  \ of the Association who told me that until five in the morning there was no other\
  \ train, hence I had to take a taxi to a hotel close and grateful, I said goodbye\
  \ to both. I was not able to sleep more than an hour and I woke up bathed in sweat,my\
  \ hands looked like those of a hundred-year-old woman, wrinkled in such a way that\
  \ it hurt to bend my fingers. I started up, covering my hands with my coat sleeves,\
  \ otherwise I would have been unable to take my suitcases. This time I had time\
  \ and experience enough to ask different people and make sure I was in the right\
  \ platform. This time, the train was fifteen minutes delayed. Even during the twelve\
  \ hours of train that I had on my way to Baia Mare, a beautiful little town in the\
  \ province of Maramure\u1E63 where the water was more expensive than beer and people\
  \ snorting glue down in public . \n\nNevertheless, over time, it has turned out\
  \ to be one of the best decisions I have made in my life, something that nobody\
  \ expected."
