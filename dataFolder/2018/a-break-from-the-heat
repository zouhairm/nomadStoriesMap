Text: "Valencia. My clothes smelled like tomatoes no matter how many times I rinsed\
  \ them in the shower. I hitchhiked out of the city, and left my bag in the car of\
  \ my first ride. I had no wallet, and no phone. I caught a ride with an empathetic\
  \ trucker from Belarus. He made me eggs and dropped me off near Cordoba. The heat\
  \ was making me delirious enough to take it personally. I sought shade under a Chestnut\
  \ tree in front of an old couple\u2019s horse feed business. Pity the American girl\
  \ who can\u2019t stand the heat, who whispers back to it for coolness of breath\
  \ \u201Cwhere do I go from here?\u201D\nI took a bus to Seville. The city was a\
  \ labyrinth of mosaics and history. You walked into it, unwise to expect how you\
  \ would come out. I liked the challenge. History here becomes tangible. Not something\
  \ that simply happened and was over but something you were always interacting with.\
  \ You\u2019d walk down an alley of the Renaissance and then turn a corner and everything\
  \ was Baroque. I walked up to a hostel and started doing work exchange. It was three\
  \ guys and me jammed into what looked like two bunk beds squeezed into a storage\
  \ closet. The work was easy; I changed sheets every other day in exchange for a\
  \ place to stay. I ran into a girl in the hostel hallway, Bertha. She was studying\
  \ at the university in Seville. The days were lazy and intense. I would play chess\
  \ with my coworkers and end up in pockets of the city with her. On my last night,\
  \ I wanted to see her but knew it was unlikely she\u2019d check her email that late,\
  \ but when I walked downstairs, she was at the door. She came on a whim. We took\
  \ mistaken buses throughout the city until we arrived at a grandiose building with\
  \ a million archways into mysterious passageways. We fought through the crowd. A\
  \ woman was dancing alone. She made eye contact with everyone who voyeuristically\
  \ crowded around her. I couldn\u2019t help but stare. She walked over people\u2019\
  s crossed legs and bags, out of the passageway. The crowd followed to a stage and\
  \ two men dancing. Nothing separated their minds and their bodies. I was completely\
  \ enraptured. After the show, Bertha and I made our way to the empty streets. The\
  \ street lamps glowed orange. I pressed my headphones to my ears and closed my eyes,\
  \ trying to imitate what the dancers seemed to possess. Interrupted at once by a\
  \ stream of boys on bikes, they turned their bikes in response to our movements.\
  \ Wheelies for twirls. I wasn\u2019t thinking anymore. I was in flow."
