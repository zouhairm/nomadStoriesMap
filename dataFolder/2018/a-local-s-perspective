Text: "Dona Victoria is an elderly lady who is set in her ways. Her son is a poacher\
  \ and turtle shells hang in their house like trophies. Her family have probably\
  \ been selling turtle eggs and meat for many years as a means to survive in this\
  \ village. \n\nParismina on the Caribbean coast of Costa Rica is a remote village\
  \ only accessible by boat. I was there volunteering on a conservation project whose\
  \ primary aim is to stop the culling of leatherback turtles. We patrolled the beach\
  \ at night looking out for turtles, trying to get to them and their eggs before\
  \ the poachers did. \n\nDona Victoria and her family didn\u2019t understand the\
  \ risk of eradicating these sea creatures. To them it is a choice between feeding\
  \ themselves or saving a turtle. \n\nThe project was trying desperately to educate\
  \ her and others like her. To help that endeavor I had agreed to stay with her for\
  \ the week. She had probably accepted this role not so much from understanding the\
  \ purpose of the project, but to get subsidised for her efforts. They lived in such\
  \ simple conditions the importance of a turtle to the future of the planet must\
  \ seem insignificant. \n\nWhen her son first came over to the house after I moved\
  \ in, Dona Victoria proudly pointed at the turtle shells hanging on the wall, the\
  \ ones that he had killed.  I understood this was a way of life for them, one that\
  \ had probably been around for generations.  As far as they were concerned this\
  \ was their livelihood we were trying to take away. \n\nI thought staying with her,\
  \ I would be integrated into the household, particularly at meal times. But she\
  \ always fed me first and then the family would have their meal. She fed me well\
  \ but sitting at the table on my own while they chatted in Spanish on the sofa just\
  \ next to me isolated me that much more. I desperately wished I had learned Spanish\
  \ before I had come out here. \n\nThere were times I questioned the viability of\
  \ the project and if our actions were making a difference. Part of me thought it\
  \ was all futile and just a tourist ploy. Then I realised that there really is something\
  \ for everyone in these situations. \n\nAt that time the poachers were getting more\
  \ of the turtles than the conservationists, but it was a start. It is a slow process\
  \ but eventually the poaching will stop. There will be alternative means for the\
  \ villagers to make a living. I think it is important to go to a remote village\
  \ like Parismina with an open heart and mind. Give to them as much as you get from\
  \ the experience."
