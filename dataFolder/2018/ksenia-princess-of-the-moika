Text: "It\u2019s St Petersburg at the peak of the Russian winter. The Neva river is\
  \ frozen, and crowds of people excitedly step on the ice in true Russian spirit,\
  \ ignoring the warning signs, saying \u2018Danger! Do not walk on ice!\u2019.\n\n\
  I\u2019m lucky to be staying in a recently renovated apartment on Ulitsa Admiralteyskaya,\
  \ a stone\u2019s throw away from the city\u2019s most treasured gem - the Hermitage.\
  \ I had never before experienced living in a place with so much beauty. From the\
  \ grandiose palace square to the romantic canals flowing below elegant bridges,\
  \ it felt like being in an open air museum.\n\nIt was Passover, and a family friend\
  \ had arranged for me to meet a girl called Ksenia, who I later learned was the\
  \ the daughter of a very well respected Jewish academic and author. I wait at a\
  \ bus stop in the Palace Square, and see a sophisticated girl with bright lipstick\
  \ and an eccentric beret approaching me. It felt like she came from another world\
  \ - the way she spoke was different. She didn\u2019t use slang, and spoke in a high-pitched\
  \ voice. She spoke Russian slowly, to make it easier for me to understand her, and\
  \ this made her sound even more \u2018wordly\u2019. \n\nKsenia taught me most of\
  \ what I know about her city. She took me to Yusupov Palace and told me the story\
  \ of Rasputin, we skipped the line at the Hermitage and went to explore some secret\
  \ collections that she had special access to, we sat by the fireplace of my favourite\
  \ cafe Teplo and quietly enjoyed some tea and a slice of medovik, a delicious layered\
  \ honey cake. We discussed art, literature, antique jewellery\u2026 \n\nOne thing\
  \ led to another, and I was invited to sing at an event at her gallery. I had been\
  \ pursuing my opera singing hobby while in Russia, with weekly lessons and had just\
  \ learned a song called \u2018On the Hills of Georgia\u2019, based on a Pushkin\
  \ poem by the composer Rimsky-Korsakov. There is a section of that poem that fascinated\
  \ me \u2018Pechal moya svetla\u2019, which means \u2018my sadness was full of light\u2019\
  , which I found to be a bit of a contradiction.\n\nYet this is the feeling I felt\
  \ when saying Goodbye to St Petersburg, and saying goodbye to my friend Ksenia.\
  \ My sadness was filled with light, because I knew that we would meet again, which\
  \ we did in London, Paris, Dublin, and through countless postcards that we exchanged\
  \ during our travels.\n\nTo me, Ksenia was St Petersburg. Elegant, intelligent,\
  \ and sophisticated; the \u2018Princess of the Moika\u2019."
