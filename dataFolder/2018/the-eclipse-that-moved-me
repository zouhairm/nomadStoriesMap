Text: "As some of you might have heard, 2017 was the year of the Great American Eclipse.\
  \ Indeed almost everyone in the US heard of it, and some have even seen it, although\
  \ a few weren\u2019t able to see anything else after that!\nAnyhow, as an European\
  \ amateur astronomer, with an ambitious \u201CTo Do List Before I Die\u201D that\
  \ ranked a Solar Total Eclipse as n\xBA2 (Northern Lights were n\xBA1, seen at the\
  \ Norwegian Arctic in 2007) I couldn\u2019t lose this opportunity. Especially, as\
  \ it would happen in such a driver-friendly environment, as the USA, which played\
  \ a great deal in my decision to come, since in 2009 I went to China for the same\
  \ purpose and catch up a cloudy sky, after taking a plane from Beijing to Shanghai,\
  \ a train from Shanghai to some-place and a packed bus from some-place to only-god-knows-where...\
  \ and a lot more hassle to stay in a small village where no one speaks any western\
  \ language or even know what the word Hotel stands for, hardened by the fact that\
  \ I was traveling alone, without a local, Chinese speaking, guide!\nSo, I figured\
  \ that, if I traveled East 10,000Km to see the Eclipse with such disappointing results,\
  \ maybe if I travel 10,000km West it would be alright.\nAnd it payed, because everything\
  \ went great! I ended watching a great Total Solar Eclipse in Unity (OR) after traveling\
  \ for 2 days from SF, reaching almost to Idaho Falls before heading back to Oregon\
  \ (because the smoke from Montana's wildfires was frightening a perfect view in\
  \ Idaho), which added 1,800kms to my planning since Yellowstone was my next target.\n\
  Lake Unity, a beautiful location, was my final pick for an impressive astronomic\
  \ show, performed by that big, big star, nicknamed, the Sun, and the pretender to\
  \ the main role, the Moon, which for some minutes even managed to eclipse the big\
  \ star! Fortunately, even a ring of light from our major Star, was enough to completely\
  \ blackout the young only-a-few-billions-years old Moon, yet, this youngster together\
  \ with the charismatic without-whom-we-wouldn\u2019t-be-here old Sun, performed\
  \ the most amazing astronomic show on Earth, which I finally had the chance to witness,\
  \ delighted, in the company of some right-away-made friends from Texas, Seattle\
  \ and even... Oregon!\nNevertheless, this was still the 4th day of my American Road\
  \ Adventure and, even if I was in a low-budget 2 weeks\u2019vacation, I did plan\
  \ a lot more, visiting 10 National Parks, 10 US States and some big cities like\
  \ Las Vegas and LA! But, that's a completely different story, a 9,000kms long story!"
