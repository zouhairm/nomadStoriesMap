Text: "\u201CTamaaleees!...tamaaaleees\u2026.!\u201D \nThrough the din of squawking\
  \ chickens, heaving mass of shoppers and chorus of her competition, one woman\u2019\
  s bleat cuts through. She sits, I assume, on a plastic chair matching those of her\
  \ neighbours, the bored expression on her wide face belying the volume of her call.\
  \ I have never seen the chair, hidden as it is beneath her generous frame and curtain\
  \ skirts. A mighty presence amidst the throbbing San Juan market, she guards three\
  \ huge silver pots. Steam escapes in tendrils where their lids sit skew, and the\
  \ smell, though mixed with chicken shit, is oddly enticing. Inside lie parcels of\
  \ corn dough, stuffed with fillings and steaming in corn husks. \n\nShe is flanked\
  \ by Mango Guy, who is busy building a grand yellow pyramid on his trestle table.\
  \ The tear-drop fruit, scrubbed to a gleam, are stacked perfectly above a floor\
  \ that houses a centimetre of filth, soggy cardboard and the wriggles of insect\
  \ infestation. He tosses extra mangos into every customer\u2019s bag with a crinkly\
  \ smile. On her other side, a cheese stall sits apparently unattended, flies allowing\
  \ no mercy. Slumped behind is the snoring proprietress, slack-faced amongst the\
  \ chaos, the fly swat dormant in her chubby hand. \n\nBack at Tamale Lady, business\
  \ is pumping. She moves bags of six, eight, twelve tamales at once, without budging\
  \ from her throne, and all the while barking nasal enquiries and wheezy cackles\
  \ at vendors and customers alike. I have been a quiet observer of these goings-on\
  \ for several weeks. First enticed by the earthy smell of corn, I was soon eating\
  \ her tamales daily. As I ate, she would glare through narrowed eyes her wariness\
  \ at my light eyes and fair skin. The markets may be my happy place, but this is\
  \ her territory. \n\nToday is no different, and I\u2019m just stammering at her\
  \ how \u2018rico\u2019 my breakfast is when I feel a sudden warmth on my ankle.\
  \ I take a second to catch on, but my plight is unmistakable. A street mutt, with\
  \ clumped fur and visible fleas, has cocked a leg\u2026on my leg. The steady stream\
  \ is soaking into my sensible socks and warming my whole foot. I look up. She is\
  \ crying with laughter. Slapping her knee, her huge frame wobbles with glee. Every\
  \ time she starts to calm down, she glimpses me and tears spring easily to her eyes.\
  \ Even Cheese Lady has woken up in the nick of time and is sharing the moment. \n\
  It dawns on me as my furry assailant trots off with his tail high that I won\u2019\
  t have a problem coming here again, and I slink away to clean myself up."
