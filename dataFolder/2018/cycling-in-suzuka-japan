Text: "Five and half years ago I experienced one of the \u201Chealthiest moments\u201D\
  \ in my whole life, cycling in Suzuka, the Honda City in Japan. This once in a lifetime\
  \ opportunity was provided by IATSS Forum after I won the leadership scholarship\
  \ for 55 days of \u201CThinking and Learning Together\u201D in Japan along with\
  \ other ASEAN Young Professionals. One day after arrival, I was given one day training\
  \ on September, 15th 2011 of how to ride bicycle in safe and sound condition. The\
  \ type of bicycle that I used at that time called \u201CSepeda Mini\u201D in Indonesian\
  \ Language. There was a basket in front of the wheel as a container to put things,\
  \ two head lamps and a honk sound \u201Cring\u2026ring\u201D. I used to do cycling\
  \ in the afternoon after lunch. September is the beginning of autumn in Suzuka,\
  \ Mie Prefecture, Central Japan and the weather is so mild with friendly sun. I\
  \ spent an hour or two cycling from the hotel in the complex of Suzuka Circuit Formula-One\
  \ to explore the surrounding areas such as AEON Mall Suzuka, Max Value Shop, Wonder\
  \ Goo Electronic Store, Suzuka Public Park, Local HONDA Showrooms, LAWSON Convenience\
  \ Store, 7-11 Suzuka and Long road of Suzuka. I really impressed with the High Standard\
  \ of Ethics that applied by the Suzukans on the street, especially in the traffic\
  \ lights. If the cyclists are trying to cross the street, all vehicles, motorcycles,\
  \ cars, minibus, and trucks will stop and give us time to cross the street safely\
  \ even though the light is already green. When the sun goes down, and the night\
  \ is coming to town, I went out of the hotel go cycling with my Philippine, Singaporean,\
  \ Laos, Cambodian, Myanmar, Vietnam and Thailand brothers and sisters to visit one\
  \ or two malls near our training center. Our Japanese course masters always remind\
  \ us to wear short scabbard that we must wear crossing from the neck down to our\
  \ hip with bright color as a \u201Clight\u201D in the dark of the night to identify\
  \ the drivers about our presence in the evening. In addition, cycling in Japan was\
  \ really great! I didn\u2019t feel tired even after hours of cycling in the afternoon\
  \ and evening. Perhaps because the supportive condition provided by the authority\
  \ in ensuring the safety of the cyclists such as providing certain special track\
  \ on the left side of the road with clear line and wide space, a button in the traffic\
  \ light that can be pushed and stop the cars if we want to cross the street and\
  \ of course the high tolerance of drivers in respecting us the cyclists on the road\
  \ by giving us giving us time"
