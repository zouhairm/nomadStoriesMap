Text: "\u201CMan is busy launching satellites today to know what lies beyond the Earth\
  \ and is not making any efforts to know the divinity that lies within him\u201D\
  .\n\nVery rightly has a great philosopher quoted the above lines. However, I am\
  \ someone who believes that man need not confine himself to a room and meditate\
  \ to listen to his inner voice. And this very opinion is the reason I am driven\
  \ to travel a lot. Every time I travel to a new place I rediscover myself in the\
  \ light of that new place.Same thing happened when I last visited a few places in\
  \ South India few months back. Because of my hectic schedule of day to day life,\
  \ the last thing I expected was to put on my rucksack and just travel around not\
  \ bothering to think if I would have fun. Conversely, that journey turned out to\
  \ be the best. \n\nThe simplicity of the house turned museum of Dr. A P J Abdul\
  \ Kalam, the former President of India, made me think if someone can actually achieve\
  \ so much in life and yet lead a simple life like he did. It also reminded me of\
  \ a quote which goes, \u2018we should not run behind money and wealth but behind\
  \ gaining knowledge and hard work. Then we will see that something greater than\
  \ money and wealth will follow us\u2019.\n\nNext spot that left a deep impact on\
  \ me was the Vivekananda Rock memorial at Kanyakumari. After spending some quality\
  \ time and meditating there I felt Swami Vivekananda- an Indian Hindu monk not only\
  \ attained enlightenment there but also left behind an aura that is bound to emanate\
  \ for thousands of years to come.\n\nOn my way back, I visited Padmanabhapuram palace\
  \ built in authentic architecture of Kerala. The perfection of the craft and the\
  \ technology used is a testimony to the fact that our ancestors were way more intelligent\
  \ than us! \n\nJust when I thought the trip was over, Mother Nature decided to throw\
  \ a surprise for me with a beautiful river by the side of the road with a lush green\
  \ background. Looking at this kind of beauty of the nature I sometimes wonder whom\
  \ is all this to please for? Given there is no one to supervise, why should these\
  \ flowers blossom everyday on their own so beautifully? Or why do these tress around\
  \ have to yield us fruits? Then I conclude that it all boils down to the fact that\
  \ every individual comes to this earth to carry out certain duties. It is the primary\
  \ duty of each individual to identify that duty and do justice to it to seek God\u2019\
  s approval.\n\nWow! What a journey it was! The last thing I expected was the least\
  \ thing I asked for."
