Text: "The alarm blared away and there was no recourse quite as satisfying as knocking\
  \ it off my night stand and hearing it crash on to the floor as I mentally screamed\
  \ \"die!\" I remember lying there, eyes closed, feeling the sun pour over me through\
  \ my window, welcoming a new day as it suddenly dawned on me that this would be\
  \ the last time I'd wake in this room. It's an eerie feeling, recognizing the last\
  \ of anything. The last time I would shed the warmth of my bed; with its sky printed\
  \ sheets. The last time I would touch my bare feet to the cool tiled floor. I could\
  \ walk in that room blind and know exactly where everything lay. It was my desert\
  \ oasis and I was leaving it behind for the time being. I was 15, a sophomore in\
  \ high school, and wanted to explore the world. Where better to start than in Mexico?\
  \ It\u2019s madness to think you can pack away everything you think you need for\
  \ the next year of your life into one suitcase. I was riddled with questions about\
  \ what I needed and what would be missing. Somehow, I packed enough toothpaste and\
  \ deodorant to supply a small village but, in hindsight, I should have packed tampons.\
  \ I had no idea that where I was going, they were bit of a taboo in 1999. The car\
  \ was ready with parents and bags and we were on our way. My mind was invaded with\
  \ harrowing questions. What was this family going to be like? A house full of strangers\
  \ and what? I was just gonna live with them? This is crazy! I was also to share\
  \ a room with what I could only imagine to be a mute, hair-in-face freak that would\
  \ randomly get up to flush the toilet for no apparent reason. 21 hours through the\
  \ Sonoran desert will have you believing most anything. My heart ached as I felt\
  \ the car put in park for the last time. I peeled my sweaty self from the vinyl\
  \ seat and looked up. The entryway was opened and my new life awaited inside. I\
  \ walked in to get out of the gruesome heat. My eyes adjusted to the shaded lighting\
  \ and I saw my new roommate in front of me. I thought she would be nervous and shy\
  \ like me but not the case at all. She was actually excited. She extended her arm\
  \ and offered me a bar of Carlos V. If nothing else, we had chocolate in common.\
  \ I lightly teased her about being in a plaid school uniform and to my dismay, she\
  \ quickly reminded me that I\u2019d soon be wearing the same thing. We laughed and\
  \ before I knew what was happening, she took me by the hand and rushed me out the\
  \ door. No time for pleasantries when there was a whole world for her to show me."
