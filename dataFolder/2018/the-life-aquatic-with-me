Text: "Blessed with warm and clear water, inhabited by hundreds of unique representatives\
  \ of aquatic life, the whole country behind my back was waiting for the final step,\
  \ but I was not ready to make it.\nI came to Egypt, being attracted by its stones,\
  \ sand, and the Red Sea, filled with coral reefs, sea urchins, and fish that came\
  \ directly from the Pixar cartoons. It\u2019s not easy to find stable and healthy\
  \ reefs nowadays, as most of them are affected by pollution and climate changes.\
  \ Therefore, my goal was to try scuba diving as soon as possible. Yesterday, I was\
  \ standing on the deck of a tourist yacht, not far from Taba, careless and full\
  \ of enthusiasm. No need to say that I\u2019ve never tried this before.\nThe human\
  \ body is a perfectly designed machine with many opportunities and functions. Initially,\
  \ this mechanism appears to be in a harmony with the outside world. You cannot fool\
  \ your body, there are no magic pills. When you dive deep down into the water and\
  \ try to breathe in for the first time, your brain refuses to follow your thoughtless\
  \ desires. Your lungs begin to shrink, pushed by an unexpected panic attack, and\
  \ your hands are nervously trying to hold on to the air, the water, and people.\
  \ And then, you find yourself climbing on a boat, being ashamed and disappointed.\n\
  Today, I am standing on the pier, wearing the scuba equipment once again. I have\
  \ discovered that it's almost impossible to negotiate with one's own body. You need\
  \ to be persuasive enough to deal with your brain. You must be calm and even seductive.\
  \ Your dreams and desires have no value until your brain will be ready to accept\
  \ the challenge.\nFortunately, I was prepared this time. An instructor, whose name\
  \ was Steven, has taught me to practice conscious relaxation, to relax the body\
  \ and mind, and to trust the people responsible for my safety. Together, we made\
  \ several small steps, and I jumped into the water. Visibility was excellent \u2013\
  \ I saw everything within a radius of 15 meters. Such an incredible clarity filled\
  \ me with joy and excitement. I felt really comfortable, diving across hard and\
  \ soft corals and almost touching Picasso Triggerfish, Moon Wrasse, and Sohal with\
  \ my hands. Steven was holding my air tank so that I could pretend to be a mermaid.\n\
  Back on the shore, the sunlight is warm and welcoming. Moreover, you are glowing\
  \ with proud and blowing up with excitement: I pushed myself to the edge, and I\
  \ managed to cross the finish line.\nBy the way, I saw Pixar\u2019s Dory fish there.\
  \ I bet she\u2019s already forgotten about me."
