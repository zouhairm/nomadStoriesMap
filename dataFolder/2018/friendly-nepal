Text: "I didn't know anything about Nepal and I just called my two other friends and\
  \ said them to go to Nepal and somehow I could able to bring them over to come with\
  \ me to Nepal. \nSo we headed towards Nepal reached  Gorakhpur junction via Bhopal,\
  \ Jhansi, and Kanpur. As we reached out to Gorakhpur we headed to Notanwa around\
  \ 40 or 50 km from Gorakhpur.\nAs I entered into the Nepal I smelled different type\
  \ of smell like I never smelled it felt like peace, I started talking to local peoples\
  \ I couldn't able to talk to their own language.And then we headed to Pokhara and\
  \ some of the local peoples helped us to get room in hotel in very cheap price.\n\
  it was long night and we woke late couse of different timing and habits .I woke\
  \ up and my friend was still sleeping and I went out to the hotel room and saw incredible\
  \ Mountain View which I never seen it before. so rushed to the my room and woke\
  \ up my friend .\nThen we had our first breakfast in Nepal. It was traditional food\
  \ curries and chutneys.\nThen we packed our bag and headed to mountain we started\
  \ our trip by road and met friendly behavior, hardworking people's on our road trip\
  \ to mountain climbed mountains like 4 pm and around and spend Lil bit time to get\
  \ rest and have some relax after spending our 1 or 2 our on top the mountain we\
  \ could able to see The Great Himalayas which I only heared about in the books.\
  \ \nBecause it was my dream to touch the great Himalayas with my own hand and and\
  \ kiss the soul of the mountain and feel the freshness of the air I felt all this.\
  \ \nIt was 25 Decmebar Christmas Eve we planned for getting down for party around\
  \ Fewa lack so we started getting down towards the lack .\nWe had completed our\
  \ half of our way to lack and everyone was excited about party near lack with new\
  \ peoples and being see the Nepali tradition for Christmas eve. \nWe were going\
  \ down faster and it was getting darker and suddenly we heared peculiar roar .yes\
  \ it was Chita's roar he was like 30 or 40 feet away from us. \nAnd we were panic\
  \ and climbed back up to mountain it was really that dark we could not see anything\
  \ and we were terribly scared so some of one called us and asked about that incident\
  \ fortunately he knew Hindi language we explained whole incident and he shelter\
  \ us for whole night and feed us like their relatives gave us respect. We made great\
  \ bonding among us. Next Morning we woke and got ready to move to hotel and promised\
  \ him to come again and meet him like a friend. \nSo finally we got the hotel."
