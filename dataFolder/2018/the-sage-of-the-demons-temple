Text: "\xABThe Demons' temple? We cannot miss it\xBB, my friend Laura says at breakfast,\
  \ pointing a page on the Beijing guidebook. It's our last day in the Chinese capital:\
  \ a temple that is populated by supernatural creatures sounds like the perfect way\
  \ to say goodbye to this fascinating city. It's a hot day, as it has been throughout\
  \ August, but the sky is cloudy and seems even greyer. The temple is just on the\
  \ major road in the Chaoyang district. Its official name is Temple of Easter Peak,\
  \ or Dongyue temple, from the name of the holiest of the Five Sacred Mountains of\
  \ China as prescribed by folk religion. Few steps into the temple are enough to\
  \ suddenly fall into an unusual world. For one thing, the silence: the noises are\
  \ a far echo. For another, there\u2019s almost no one around: just a guard and two\
  \ or three people. In the always-crowded world\u2019s second most populous city,\
  \ that is unforeseen, to say the least. The temple is organized in three courtyards.\
  \ Running along the walls, 76 small rooms inhabited by dusty and disturbing statues\
  \ of supernatural creatures remind devotees how Taoist Gods are going to punish\
  \ or reward them for their lifetime actions. I'm walking around alone, bewitched,\
  \ when someone touches my arm.\_A little Chinese old woman is looking at me with\
  \ a toothless smile. She points at my camera and then at the no photo sign, and\
  \ says something Chinese that I can't understand. I uselessly try to communicate\
  \ in English and explain that I haven\u2019t taken any photograph. But she gestures\
  \ for me to follow her, takes me in front of the first small room and motions to\
  \ me to stay ready. As the guard distances from us, she suddenly intimates me to\
  \ take a photo of the demons statues, and I do it. She looks deeply amused by the\
  \ violation, and so she\u2019ll be my lookout for the next over 70 cellars. She\
  \ limps because of her age, but she is determined to lead me. I soon give up trying\
  \ to make her realize that I can't understand a thing. I believe she knows that\
  \ a different language can't prevent a connection. Just with her gestures, she explains\
  \ to me how to pray and, speaking in Chinese very slowly (as if it could help),\
  \ she tries to make me aware of the supernatural creatures we are ingratiating.\
  \ Room after room, we arrive at the temple exit. I have not the time to look for\
  \ my friend: I'm somehow touched by the encounter and I would like to say something.\
  \ However, she seems shy all of a sudden. She merely walks away along the main road,\
  \ after a genuine goodbye-smile."
