Text: "The people we found till we reached the village garladinne a small village\
  \ in Andhra Pradesh state of India, were almost similar to the north of the india\
  \ such as fighting for seat in train bargaining with each vandor whether they want\
  \ to buy or not indistinct chatter debate on govt. Schemes playing antakshari( song\
  \ related game) dumb charades etc. In train. The only difference was language.\n\
  The first people we met was in Mumbai she was aunt of one of my friends the kind\
  \ of treatment she gave to us in 4 hours\u200B of our stay was incredible but as\
  \ soon as we left their place and pick up auto for reaching railway station one\
  \ of my friend forgot his bag in the auto all the documents and some money was in\
  \ it we thought we have lose this but after 15 min. A call came to his phone regarding\
  \ the bag, the auto driver return him the bag and keep the money that was inside\
  \ the bag that was around 500rs. This makes us wonder whether to thank him or curse\
  \ him. After this two we found the third interesting man who was T.T.E. who talk\
  \ to us like a long lost friend he guide us how to go garladinne and wished us luck.\
  \ After that we reached anantapur we took a auto for garladinne just for 200 rs\
  \ for about 15km the same distance might have fetched amount of 500 rs in our city.\
  \ We talked to every person in mixture of hindi english and most of the reliance\
  \ was on sign language because they don't understand both of the language the kind\
  \ of conversation we had with them was less of understanding but full of emotionally\
  \ and respectfully. They treated us like we have come from another universe the\
  \ enthusiasm we both had was out of the world. We made friends with one auto driver\
  \ who helped us in visiting whole of the town. The aunt who had tea stall where\
  \ we visit almost 3-4 time a day had a very big heart in initial days we pay her\
  \ at that time instant but after that we started a account for daily expenses, she\
  \ couldn't even speak a word of hindi but she understand everything that we ask\
  \ from her but that was only. Then the last person we found interesting was the\
  \ auto driver in Bengaluru from him we bargain for 10 rs he refused for that but\
  \ int that 10rs he give us glimps at how the auto drivers earns money and how can\
  \ they make 40000-50000 in a day despite of that how their life is financial struggle\
  \ and yet why they don't want to leave the job of driving.the answer to this was\
  \ simply amazing and relatable The last place was tirupati mandir where we found\
  \ the most interestig people"
