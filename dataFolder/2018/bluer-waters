Text: "The iron sea was hissing and spitting like a tiger below us, and the clouds\
  \ were a dark bruise above. We were in the claws of a squall, 2,000 miles from land,\
  \ carving through waves on a 20-meter sailing yacht in the Pacific. Fifteen days\
  \ earlier, we had left the coast of Panama. It would be another week before we reached\
  \ French Polynesia. I couldn't even smell the salt in the wind anymore, it was just\
  \ cold and wet- then a sharp smell as we passed a shoal of flying fish. They saluted,\
  \ hopping out of our way in ripples. \nI was en route to sail across the Pacific.\
  \ My goal was to find places uncorrupted by modern life. I wanted to visit islands\
  \ that didn't exist on Google Earth, to see villagers bent over pineapple fields\
  \ rather than crunched over computer screens. I wanted to lose cell phone service\
  \ and not regain it until I emerged on the other side of an ocean, somehow cleansed\
  \ of modern living. \nA day from the Tuamotus, an archipelago in French Polynesia,\
  \ the air started smelling warmer and richer. Finally, we saw Raroia, just a barely\
  \ raised mound of sand, covered in palm trees. The lush green palms were candy for\
  \ our color-starved eyes. The villagers welcomed us ashore. A mob of children, half-naked\
  \ and covered in sand surrounded us and we committed to a game of football the following\
  \ afternoon. \nThat night, the entire village turned up to celebrate. Our plates\
  \ were piled high with fish and crab, our cups spilled over with local sugarcane\
  \ rum, and the wrinkly grandmothers were dancing to the beating of drums. I borrowed\
  \ a ukulele and stayed late playing with them.They told me how they spent their\
  \ days along the water, fishing and diving for pearls. They spent their nights with\
  \ their families, telling stories and eating the day's catch. It was a simplicity\
  \ to long for. \nWe were creamed in football the next day, by the village kids.\
  \ As a consolation prize, they brought us a paper clutched in their fingers. It\
  \ was a magazine ad with brightly colored pictures of cell phones. They pointed\
  \ out their favorites, and then solemnly pressed it into my hands. It was an ad\
  \ that was ten years old; longer than most cell phones were kept. The villagers\
  \ asked about the cities we were from and they marveled over our sunglasses and\
  \ wrist watches. I thanked them for what they'd taught me. The water is always bluer\
  \ on the other side. The village kids swam out a ways, waving and smiling as we\
  \ sailed away. I couldn't help but envy their empty hands as I snapped photos."
