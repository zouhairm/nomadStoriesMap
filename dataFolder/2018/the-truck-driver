Text: "Never been a fan of hitchhiking. Like most people, I was afraid of getting\
  \ into someone-I-don\u2019t-know\u2019s car \u2014 a space way too small to share\
  \ with someone unacquainted. A car pulls over, you get in\u2026 and you\u2019re\
  \ trapped.\n\nAlways been a fan of pushing my own limits. If I know that other people\
  \ hitchhike (and that allows them to save money and get from one place to another\
  \ quickly), why not me? \n\nFirst challenge: from Brisbane to Melbourne... on my\
  \ thumb. \n\nI was in Port Macquarie, aiming to reach Coffs Harbor. A huge truck\
  \ pulled in. To get my backpack all the way up to the cabin was a formidable feat.\
  \ After hoping in, two consecutive thoughts flashed on my mind: number 1, how great\
  \ this place is! Number 2, oh-oh... who\u2019s this guy?\n\nNumber 1: I had never\
  \ sat in the cabin of a really big truck. It resembled more the cockpit of an airplane\
  \ than the driving spot of a vehicle. The seat was comfortable and the views from\
  \ up there, astonishing.\n\nNumber 2: there was this bloke at the steering wheel\
  \ that made my breath stop. A skinny guy in his late forties, full of tattoos, missing\
  \ a few teeth probably from grinding them one against the other. The tension in\
  \ his whole body foretold things I was not eager to discover. He introduced himself\
  \ politely and begun to drive.\n\nHe started talking like there was no tomorrow.\
  \ He was a former soldier of the Australian army, a spy working for the secret services.\
  \ His mission: to get close to the Thai king and find out the secrets of one of\
  \ the richest man on Earth. He became a member of his personal guard. He showed\
  \ me pictures on his mobile phone next to the king at a party, at the king\u2019\
  s office with a bunch of American dollars on the table, with the king and his family.\
  \ After some time, he resigned because he received what he considered 'unethical\
  \ orders'. He wanted to keep his integrity (I was so thankful to hear that). After\
  \ issuing his resignation, the guys with ties started keeping an eye on him. He\
  \ was in prison for some time and now\u2026 he was driving a truck.\n\nWe reached\
  \ my destination. He pulled in and got off to help me unload my backpack. He didn\u2019\
  t show any reluctance when I asked to take a picture of us both: the heavily-tattooed\
  \ guy and the Spanish backpacker. He passed me his number in case I needed anything\
  \ during my stay in Australia and wished me best travels.\n\nMy heart broke a bit\
  \ when we said bye. We had only spent a couple of hours together. I got my ride.\
  \ He got someone to share his story with. What a story."
