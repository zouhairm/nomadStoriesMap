Text: "And that is how we ended up in a situation I\u2019ll never forget. I suppose\
  \ it was bound to happen sometime on this trip. I suppose if we follow our instincts\
  \ in strange, sprawling and sometimes, wild places long enough, it\u2019ll surely\
  \ end in trouble. I just didn\u2019t expect it to happen on this particular Sunday\
  \ morning. \n Suddenly, out of nowhere, three rough looking characters rush us.\
  \ Surrounding us before we can manage a civil \u201CExcuse me\u201D they push us\
  \ around demanding money. Slamming Dan against a car, two of them strip him of his\
  \ credit card, money and camera while the other pins me against a wall and pulls\
  \ out a gun from under his grubby vest. \u2018How the fuck did I end up here\u2019\
  \ races through my mind as I feel the cold barrel of his pistol pushing against\
  \ my head. \"Munny!! Munny!! Munny!!\u201D he demands aggressively as one hand rifles\
  \ through my pockets while the other keeps the pistol pressed against my temple.\
  \ His giant psychotic pupils are a sure sign he\u2019s high on crack and his greasy\
  \ fingers frantically dig deep for loose notes and change in my pockets. I look\
  \ round for help but the street is empty. Violation runs through my veins. Dan is\
  \ pinned against a car and still being roughed up. Out of the corner of my eye,\
  \ I can see he\u2019s lost his glasses. I see him squinting from the glaring sun.\
  \ I take a chance on the gun not being loaded and push the skinny crackhead away\
  \ from me. I do so with enough force to catch him off guard. He stumbles back, regains\
  \ his composure and laughs, shouting something to his mates while keeping the pistol\
  \ trained on me. Seeing my chance, I turn to run, but before I take a step I feel\
  \ the whack of the gun handle on the top of my head. \"Fuck you!\u201D I shout at\
  \ him, cowering. \u201CHere's the backpack! I have nothing else! I have nothing\
  \ else!\" I am screaming now, covering my head with my hands and still cowering\
  \ against the wall. I am certain he\u2019s going to shoot me. Still laughing, he\
  \ rips the bag from my hands and they all run off up the street. \u201CMis anteojos!\u201D\
  \ Dan shouts to one of them, pleading for his glasses back. Tossing them over his\
  \ shoulder, the youth laughs as we watch the glasses skid and bounce across the\
  \ road, stopping at our feet. They are badly scratched but better than nothing.\
  \  I feel like I\u2019m sinking in a place where I can\u2019t communicate. It\u2019\
  s daunting enough just trying to buy simple things from a store; now, after what\
  \ just happened, I\u2019m starting to doubt if this trip was really a good idea\
  \ in the first place."
