Text: "To travel is more than to expand the mind and having experiences-- which will\
  \ make for great story telling. To travel is more than visiting sights and meeting\
  \ friends. To travel, to travel is... to find answers. To travel is\u2026 to find\
  \ yourself.\n\nIn 2014, I felt my spirit constricted. I had been invited on several\
  \ occasions to visit \u201Cmy Argentinian family.\u201D That summer, my heart seemed\
  \ like it needed more than NYC. I was happy, yet I felt sad. I was constricted.\
  \ The last few years I just seemed to survive. I finally made my mind to travel,\
  \ even though I was broke. \n\nMami had met the H family once, and gave me her blessings.\
  \ I rushed. I borrowed money for in case of an emergency.  I was excited and still\
  \ so unsure. Where was I going? \n\nMy first Argentinian picture of me was at 6\
  \ a.m. on a common street. My mind was still blank. My adventure was just starting\
  \ and it was time for me to sleep. Once awake, I explored Argentina and I felt as\
  \ if I was partly in Milano and yet also in Dominican Republic. I walked. I laughed.\
  \ I took odd pictures. My feet ached. I had adventures. At La Casa Rosada, I felt\
  \ a knowing, here had been Eva Per\xF3n-- a hero. I walked the space with my tour\
  \ group (friends of \"the boss.\" I half listened. I breathed at the main rooms\
  \ of government and felt my ears warm in the rooms of Eva Per\xF3n. Finally, we\
  \ went to that balcony-- sadly, (women in white) were demonstrating and that flooded\
  \ up feeling to sing \"don't cry for me Argentina\" stayed in my throat... though,\
  \ I did raise my arms, stood with strength and spoke to the people (in my mind)\
  \ as she had done.\n\nAfter a few days, I traveled north to Salta. That is where\
  \ I found beauty of nature that I simply must share with you, if you permit me.\
  \ I traveled on a bus where the sit turned into a bed. (Travel tip: always carry\
  \ some ducktape\u2014for the window that let the cold night air in the WHOLE way\
  \ there. \n\nIn the town of Metan, Salta, Don H, sat me in the kitchen table and\
  \ said the words I had been looking for all along, \"We work hard, because we enjoy\
  \ traveling and living life.\" I remember still how my mind and body expanded from\
  \ his simple and caring words. Though, I was still feeling small and would have\
  \ enjoyed just strolling about Met\xE1n, the family packed the truck and took me\
  \ on a breath-taking \u201Cpaseo\u201D to Jujui, Tucum\xE1n and the ever changing\
  \ landscape and colors of Salta herself. \n\nI returned home, like Dorothy\u2014\
  so sure and on a path of who I am as a person with purpose."
