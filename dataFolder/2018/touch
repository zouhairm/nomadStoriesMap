Text: "When the tide was low enough, the ice cream vendor motioned to all the wary\
  \ tourists, \u201CCome now!\u201D He stood on the other side of the rocks, looking\
  \ out for oncoming waves. I waited, sinking into the coarse sand, rough against\
  \ my feet. \u201CGo! Hurry!\u201D We ducked through the cave, then ran through the\
  \ cold, shallow water as if our lives depended on it. \n\nOn the other side, the\
  \ Balinese sun greeted us with blinding warmth. Mounds of trash hid behind hot pink\
  \ and teal boat wreckage. Close to the cave entrance, smooth gray stone awnings\
  \ provided the only shade. That is where I liked to sit and write. The touch of\
  \ cool rock against my skin, too hard for comfort. \n\nThe local women hung sarungs\
  \ on clothes lines, and asked everyone multiple times, \u201CBracelet? Sarung? Why\
  \ you no buy from me?\u201D\n\nI was feeling lonely when a woman in a red fisherman\u2019\
  s hat approached me, \u201CYou waitin fah boyfran? Boyfraaan suwrfing all deh. You\
  \ wait until dahk!\u201D. Her smile was as bright as the sun, and a little blinding\
  \ at first. There was food stuck in her large, crooked teeth. She rested her long,\
  \ bony, brown fingers on my shoulder. It felt strange at first. In my culture, we\
  \ don\u2019t do that, especially not with strangers. But there was something about\
  \ her touch that made me pause and think: this feels natural. I didn\u2019t realize\
  \ how much I missed touch until she touched me. It was unlike sand, sun, or rock;\
  \ it was human.\n\nEveryday, we watched the waves together. She braided my hair\
  \ and wrapped my wrists in bracelets. She insisted on sharing the little food she\
  \ had with me. Some days we spoke, some days we didn\u2019t. Something deeper than\
  \ language connected us. One day, she asked, \u201CWhat you write?\u201D \n\n\u201C\
  A book. You like books?\u201D \n\n\u201CYeah, I like. But, no can read.\u201D \n\
  \nIt hit me like a wave on the head. I hadn\u2019t stopped to think she couldn\u2019\
  t enjoy something I loved so dearly. \n\nSuddenly, I wanted to teach her to read.\
  \ She didn\u2019t seem that interested. She wrote down the few words she could:\
  \ MADE MERI (her name), BALI, MOJET (monkey), and MAMA. I showed her how to write\
  \ her name in Arabic. Then, I asked her, \u201CAre there any words you want to know\
  \ how to write Made (pronounced mah-deh) Meri?\u201D \n\n\u201CPanti!\u201D she\
  \ said. \u201CAll go single fin, drink Bintang in beach panti, and do like dis all\
  \ night!\u201D She danced around the beach, laughing. She was always laughing. This\
  \ was not a bitter woman. Made Meri embraced being \u2013 she was alive. She taught\
  \ me how to pull myself off the pages of my notebook and be alive with her."
