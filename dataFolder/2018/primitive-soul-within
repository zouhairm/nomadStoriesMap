Text: "Unmindfulness in life as a whole, often leads us to focus on just the essentials\
  \ of life. In the quest to live,with simpler thoughts, we calibrate our logic in\
  \ accordance to our convenience.Discomfort sweeps in when we wake up from the Yoganidra\
  \ of  routine patterns with an urge of being lost, away from comforts of familiarity.\
  \ Most adventurous thing in my working professional life was to sail through the\
  \ rough tides of Mumbai\u2019s traffic.Recently read about how a more recent fighting\
  \ art has captured the world`s imagination popularly known as Muay Thai. On the\
  \ onset it looked like an adventure more on the borderlines of craziness, as, a\
  \ 30 something man who landed all alone in Phuket(Thailand) with a wish to undergo\
  \ exclusive training of a fairly competitive combat sport with the best in the world.\
  \ I was a bundle of enthusiasm, as I greeted everyone with Sawadee-krap (Thais bow\
  \ down in respect to the soul in other beings) but physically I was quite distant\
  \ from what was required of a lithe but strong body of a nak muay, as mine had been\
  \ cocooned in an ergonomic chair for a decade.Travel and fighting both encompass\
  \ a sense of adventure, fluid yet unyielding, unknown and elegant yet chaotic and\
  \ here I was getting an opportunity to push myself on the edge of the incomprehensible.Thais\
  \ kids start training as early as  when 4 years old and get into the world of prize\
  \ fighting at the ripe age of 10 with an intent to earn, send some money to the\
  \ family back in the village.The money which these fighters get to earn is in literal\
  \ sense, blood and sweat money.As one sweats or as in my case struggles through\
  \ each session ,seeing beaming smiles on the  thai trainers faces  after a gruelling\
  \ session is bound to recharge your enthusiasm for the next session.Many of the\
  \ thai trainers doubled up with other jobs as well. I was delighted to see one of\
  \ my trainers as a boatman ready to ferry me around the serene waters of Koh Khai\
  \ islands and other as a security person of  the Big Buddha.Love for muay thai drives\
  \ them to be associated with Muay Thai in some or the other capacity.One can see\
  \ Thai trainers gathering kids from the village and pushing them through the paces\
  \ with their impeccable sense of humour ;it was an empowering sight.But the best\
  \ will be the walk from my pad to the training academy through the canopies, winding\
  \ roads of Rawai; villagefolks undertaking their daily chores as usual but halting\
  \ midway to greet Sawadee-krap with their effervescent smiles."
