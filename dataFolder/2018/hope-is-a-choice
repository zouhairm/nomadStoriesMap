Text: "Pu\u2019u o\u2019o cone smolders on the eastern slope of Kilauea. In 1983,\
  \ it erupted, transforming sixty miles of lush Hawaiian forest into an undulating\
  \ sea of black stone. We scrambled across the shoe-shredding rock for hours, using\
  \ Pu\u2019u O\u2019o\u2019s plume to navigate toward the active lava flow. A couple\
  \ trudged toward us. Blood caked the woman\u2019s knee and calf. It looked like\
  \ she\u2019d shaved with a citrus-zester. I shrugged off my pack to grab out the\
  \ first-aid kit, \u2018I have some gauze and\u2026\u2019 She cut me off, \u2018\
  I\u2019m fine.\u2019 I let the lie slide. \u2018How was the lava?\u2019 Frustration\
  \ twisted her face, \u2018No lava. Just rocks.\u2019 I saw the question in my companions\u2019\
  \ eyes, and I suddenly felt smaller. They had agreed to come after I said we would\
  \ see flowing lava. It would be dark soon making the terrain even tougher. Each\
  \ step farther made our return to civilization that much longer. They shrugged,\
  \ \u2018You planned this. It\u2019s your call.\u2019\n\nMost journeys begin with\
  \ hope. We hope to see things that will expand our world. We hope to feel something\
  \ that transforms us. We hope the experience will be worth the effort. Hope lures\
  \ us out of our safe and comfortable existences to explore wild and unpredictable\
  \ places. When reality dashes our hopes, it is easy to sink into cynicism. I would\
  \ rather choose hope and be wrong, than be cynical and right. I shouldered my pack,\
  \ \u2018Let\u2019s keep going.\u2019 \n\nPu\u2019u O\u2019o disappeared into the\
  \ night, leaving us to trust our earlier direction. Even in the darkness we found\
  \ a rugged beauty in the barren expanse. Our lamps refracted off the porous stone,\
  \ shimmering into tiny dark prisms. The rock wrinkled like black fabric twisted\
  \ then tossed across the landscape. A thin line of red glowed deep in a jagged crack.\
  \ Heat wafted up, beckoning us onward. As we crested a rise, the darkness shattered.\
  \ The crack spider-webbed into dozens of glowing threads. Lava streams in every\
  \ hue of heat wove through the black stone, and we walked into the heart of it all.\
  \ We stood a single step away from a slowly growing pool of molten rock as its heat\
  \ baked our faces. Sun bright magma swelled beneath ripples of auburn lava barely\
  \ cooling on the surface. The quiet crackle of liquid rock crystallizing whispered\
  \ in the night. I exhaled and felt hope transformed into awe.\n\nMost decisions\
  \ shape our lives slowly like wind and water wearing down stone. But some choices\
  \ change us in an instant. That night, on Pu\u2019u O\u2019o\u2019s black sea, our\
  \ world suddenly expanded. We watched the earth itself give birth to stone."
