Text: "This is the story of how I nearly fell off a mountain. Okay, might be a bit\
  \ of an exaggeration, but it felt like it at the time. \nI\u2019d been in Edinburgh\
  \ for two nights. It was my first stop on a two week solo trip whilst I was studying\
  \ abroad in Paris. I had never travelled alone before, so needless to say I was\
  \ a tad nervous. On my first day I had gone on a tour of the Highlands and come\
  \ across another lone traveller \u2013 a young girl from the Netherlands, Lauren.\
  \ I mentioned that the next day I was planning on climbing Arthur\u2019s Seat, the\
  \ famous mountain that overlooks Edinburgh. She knew a Dutch guy, Rens, who also\
  \ wanted to climb Arthur, so we decided to go together. \nWe arrived with about\
  \ five layers of clothing on, ready to venture up. We had heard from others that\
  \ there were two routes you could take: one for beginners and one for experts. As\
  \ none of us were at all experienced we decided to try to find the beginners route\
  \ so we could have a leisurely stroll and chat along the way. That did not occur.\
  \ \nInitially it wasn\u2019t too scary. There were stairs hewn into the rock and\
  \ I felt pretty relaxed. However that calm soon began to dissipate as the stairs\
  \ became more and more steep and slippery, even for my beloved Doc Martens. \n\u201C\
  I\u2019m pretty sure this isn\u2019t the beginner\u2019s trail,\u201D I laughed\
  \ nervously. \nAfter another minute or so the stairs disappeared altogether and\
  \ we were left with a tiny path embedded in the rock. My Docs were definitely beginning\
  \ to slip and slide now, and my legs shook with nerves when I turned and saw how\
  \ high we were.\nAnyone who has been to Edinburgh will know it gets very windy.\
  \ Well, up Arthur\u2019s Seat that wind was amplified a hundred-fold. It was fierce\
  \ and cold yet I was sweating under my jacket. Lauren and I were a constant babble\
  \ of \u201Coh my god\u201D, \u201Coh Jesus\u201D and other expletives I will not\
  \ include in this recount. \nThe last steps to the summit were incredibly steep\
  \ and every nerve in me was telling me to run back down. But one glance behind me\
  \ told me that was not an option. So I hauled myself up. \nIt was so worth it. In\
  \ the centre of the summit was a sun dial. We sat on the edge for about half an\
  \ hour in silence, simply taking in the moment. The sun was beginning to set and\
  \ it looked spectacular reflecting off the ocean. On the other side I could see\
  \ the city, its gothic towers reminding me of the fantasy novels I love so much.\
  \ Eventually, almost simultaneously, we turned to one another and agreed it was\
  \ time to go."
