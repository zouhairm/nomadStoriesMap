Text: "I stood there, toes peeking over the ledge of an old iron bridge, wind threatening\
  \ my balance and the voice of a never-named Ecuadorian man urging me in Spanish,\
  \ a language I wasn\u2019t able to understand, in a country I knew barely anything\
  \ about.\nThen I jumped.\nIt\u2019s May 2011 and we\u2019re in Banos.\nThe city\
  \ sits high in central Ecuador, a town cupped in the palms of the Andes. Below our\
  \ feet arrows painted in yellow mark the pavement: evacuation routes.The Tungurahua\
  \ volcano looms nearby and is known for its frequent, powerful ashy explosions.Last\
  \ night, a dull red plum of soot and smoke blotted the sky through a smudge of clouds\
  \ past the city.\nWe\u2019re walking cobblestoned sidewalks, past houses of blush\
  \ and yellow, to the bridge.There, leaning casually against the railing, an unlit\
  \ cigarette lazily dangling from his lips, stands the man we\u2019ll be entrusting\
  \ with our lives. \nI\u2019ve broken out into a cold sweat as Brian looks at me\
  \ and speaks the cruelest words of entrapment.\u201CYou need to go first.\u201D\
  \ \nOur guide is saying something in Spanish and distractedly, I nod, stepping into\
  \ the leg loops of a harness.Each snug bite of the tightening buckles into my skin\
  \ makes this more real and I look at Brian who smiles encouragingly.Then I look\
  \ out at the empty air past the bridge. \nA small platform clings to the outside\
  \ of it, empty air pressed in on all sides.Moments later, I\u2019m atop the railing,\
  \ toes grazing the platform, fingernails scrapping the chipped green paint.At my\
  \ back, the man is speaking soothingly but I\u2019m distracted by the lack of solid\
  \ earth beneath my feet and the threat of free-fall.Then this stranger\u2019s hands\
  \ are on my back and he\u2019s pushing me, urging me to let go of the rail.Brian\u2019\
  s trying to reassure me that I won\u2019t die, but what does he know?He\u2019s testing\
  \ the validity of this adventure with my life first. \nThere\u2019s no invincible\
  \ vibes or trustingly confident facade surfacing from the depths of my psyche here.There\u2019\
  s just a scared shitless gringa standing on the wrong side of a bridge.Hands on\
  \ my back, toes inch forward. \nAnd then I\u2019m falling.\nAir is sucked in through\
  \ clenched teeth as I plunge down 100 meters.The wind against my face is the kind\
  \ that slaps, a density to the invisible element that suffocates.There\u2019s too\
  \ much of it to breathe so I fall with my mouth clamped shut. I\u2019m not blinking.I\
  \ can\u2019t blink.Then something snaps and I\u2019m jerked.The world stops falling\
  \ around me and I\u2019m caught, swaying midair as gravity yanks me against the\
  \ harness at my waist and legs."
