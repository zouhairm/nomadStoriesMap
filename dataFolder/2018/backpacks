Text: "Since their tenth birthday, Alma and all her neighbors carry a backpack that\
  \ is given to them that same day, which they are not allowed to see and their functionality\
  \ is not considered, since it is a kind of tradition.\n \n\"It's time to leave,\"\
  \ she repeated over and over in her head. She no longer felt happy and the need\
  \ to change the scene was irrepressible. Finally she decided to take the step. \"\
  Dad, mom, I bought a ticket to another place and I do not know when I'll be back.\"\
  \ Those words, trembling, would change the course of Alma forever.\n \nSeventeen\
  \ long hours passed until, frightened, she got off the bus and started walking through\
  \ the unknown town, observing everything around her. As she was so hungry she decided\
  \ to go inside a small tavern that inspired her confidence. She sat down at the\
  \ table and looked around. Like her, they all wore backpacks and communicated in\
  \ ways she had never seen before.\n \nHungry, she approached the bar and tried to\
  \ talk to the waitress, but she did not understand anything. Alma, scared, returned\
  \ alone to her place. After an hour, invaded by a strong frustration, she decided\
  \ to get up and imitate the person in front of her in the queue. Ten minutes later,\
  \ she finally enjoyed her meal.\n \nA strange sensation ran through Alma's body,\
  \ she did not understand it but she knew it was good. That night she ended up in\
  \ a shared room full of bunk beds. She put her backpack aside, sighed, lied down\
  \ on the bed and fell asleep. From that moment that place began to become her new\
  \ home.\n \nOne day like any other, when she got up, Alma realized that her backpack\
  \ was not that heavy anymore. She could not find an explanation, but she felt happy.\
  \ That same night, while chatting with a villager, she saw from the corner of her\
  \ eye how somebody took something from her backpack.\n \nFrightened by what happened,\
  \ it took a long time to fall sleep, but the next morning she felt curiously strange.\
  \ She was another person. She had finally understood what that backpack meant. Alma\
  \ had left her comfort zone, and each time she struggled with fear, the backpack\
  \ weighed less thanks to the people around her. The backpack was ignorance, and\
  \ the less loaded it was, the easier to travel and explore the world. That day,\
  \ She didn\u2019t need a push anymore. Now, Alma opens her backpack without help,\
  \ sure of herself, so that her neighbors can take from it what they want. That day,\
  \ Alma finally found freedom."
