Text: "I\u2019m writing this from the snow-capped mountains, where it rains in cups\
  \ of locally brewed tea. The culture is a field of bonfires, singing for the mountains\
  \ and giggling to the likes of us tourists- panting at a 2 kilometre climb uphill.\
  \ I went out to grab a thali (A thali is a serving of rice, slices of Indian bread,\
  \ pulses and roasted vegetables). The walk downhill wasn\u2019t tiring, with Katy\
  \ Perry roaring out of my phone and into my ears. If the earphones ever came loose\
  \ and people were to hear me listening to a 2012 Perry, I would say it was my sister\
  \ who switched my playlist. I only listen to the likes of The Doors, Eagles etc.\
  \ \nThe thali place is run by a stout, local woman, who was knitting gloves when\
  \ I arrived. The television had a reality show on, an amateur group playing instruments-\
  \ judged till their pants dropped to the group and spaded a hole large enough to\
  \ bury themselves in. I plopped myself in the chair closest to the window. That\u2019\
  s the thing about me and windows, it\u2019s a love affair. I find myself craning\
  \ out of windows of all shapes. I heard uneven giggling, turned around to see two\
  \ children tugging on each other. \nI noticed their creased uniforms and figured\
  \ it was the joy of being back home,\nbeing rebellious.\n\u201CWash your hands and\
  \ eat your food\u201D\nThe lady screamed over the crackling wood fire.\n\u201CI\
  \ don\u2019t want to eat\u201D, the one in the frock quipped.\n\u201CWash your hands\
  \ and be back in 2 minutes!\u201D\nThe child took to her feet, sat in the table\
  \ across me and taped her fingers restlessly.\n\u201CDid you wash your hands?\u201D\
  \ \n\u201Cyes!\u201D \n\u201CRaise your hands, show me\u201D\nAnd raise she did.\n\
  \u201CNow pull your cuffs up and eat\u201D\nMy greatest joy is 3 full meals. And\
  \ them being served to me is a luxury that stays unmatched to solitaires pole-dancing\
  \ to Jason Derulo. \nI poured myself, into my thali. \nI have been craving for greasy\
  \ potato curry with black pulses. I scarfed it down without looking up. Each chunk\
  \ of that potato-pea curry was swirling in my mouth- like a little ballerina on\
  \ her toes! The joy of belting down a thali, when you have grown up on the land\
  \ of curries is serendipity. I would come back home to my mother\u2019s concoction\
  \ of cardamom doing somersaults on cloves, garlic bringing back ginger into the\
  \ picture and cilantro being smashed like poets in a poetry slam. I go weak in my\
  \ knees for jeera flamed potatoes and charcoaled infested brinjals.\nThe child to\
  \ her mother, on a foggy day of Himachal Pradesh is one of many feelings I think\
  \ is a local connect, more local than the tea here."
