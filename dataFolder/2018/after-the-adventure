Text: "As I lie in a bed that \u2014\_although mine \u2014 feels alien to me, my heart\
  \ is somewhere else. It\u2019s 2am; I\u2019ve reached the deepest part of night\
  \ without sleep. Yet jet lag is no longer an excuse; I\u2019ve been home 9 days,\
  \ my body is back on GMT. I ought to get a job, to regain routine, to accept that\
  \ this trip is behind me. The flannel pyjamas itch against my sun-kissed skin; a\
  \ reminder that tomorrow I\u2019d need to wrap up to face the chill. The week had\
  \ seen little sun \u2014 England\u2019s North East not famous for its mild winters.\
  \ I listen to wind whip round the house as I sigh and snuggle in, searching for\
  \ solace.\n\nThen sleep must have come, as now I\u2019m in a floaty dress and can\
  \ feel heat on my face. Strolling again the streets of Oaxaca\_de Ju\xE1rez, towards\
  \ the church, it\u2019s morning and the smell of grilled cheese and spicy salsa\
  \ embellishes the air. The way the rising sun hits the technicolour facades along\
  \ the calle always wows me; each house as bright as a crayon.\n\nI dip to my right\
  \ and find my favourite empanada vendor. \u201CHola!\u201D I say, smiling. \u201C\
  Buenos Dias!\u201D she replies, her smile twice bigger than my own. She\u2019s an\
  \ illumination of colours as she prepares my morning pastry. Dressed in woven blues,\
  \ purples and pinks, her wide eyes brown and endless. She hands me my breakfast.\
  \ Her eyes greet mine and our hands touch; such affection from someone with whom\
  \ I\u2019ve shared so few words. Bringing the empanada to my mouth, I feel its warmth\
  \ emanating. I\u2019m intoxicated by my surroundings. Therein lies the beauty of\
  \ Mexico; the welcoming society, wholesome food, wondrous culture.\n\nMy eyelids\
  \ reluctantly blink open. The red beam of my bedside clock tells me I\u2019ve slept\
  \ for an hour. One hour spent enjoying the past: unworried about the future. My\
  \ foot had peeped out from beneath the sheets; I pull it back, shivering. The last\
  \ thing I expected returning home was to feel so displaced. I urge myself back to\
  \ sleep, back to Oaxaca.\n\nThis time, I\u2019m atop a roof as the sun sets. I\u2019\
  m with Jess, an Australian from my hostel with whom I\u2019ve bonded quickly. We\
  \ sit, discussing marriage equality, films and street art. Sipping earthy mezcal\
  \ with cerveza chasers, minutes slip into hours. It\u2019s bliss.\n\nShrieking,\
  \ my alarm tells me it is morning. I roll over, retrieve my laptop from the floor.\
  \ Shaking off sleep, it\u2019s time to push forward, to get out of this funk. I\
  \ open the web browser: two tabs. In one, I type \u2018Jobs in Newcastle\u2019.\
  \ In the other, \u2018Cheap flights to Mexico\u2019. \n\nI go downstairs to make\
  \ some coffee."
