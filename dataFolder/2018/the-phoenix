Text: "I sat by the edge of the boat staring gloomily into space. As I rested my head\
  \ on my knee, few tear-drops trickled down my face. The restless ocean and the bumpy\
  \ waves mirrored the disappointment in my heart. \nI was in the middle of the enigmatic\
  \ \"Great Barrier Reef\", the dream destination from my childhood, the first password\
  \ of my e-mail account.\nI was in Australia for work and had planned a quick trip\
  \ to Cairns.\nAs I wore my scuba diving suit, I recollected the numerous documentaries\
  \ I had devoured growing up, always been intrigued and fascinated by the reef\u2019\
  s beauty, vastness and uniqueness. Today I was finally going to witness the magical\
  \ world in person.\nBut as I started diving, for the first time I realised my nervous\
  \ excitement had another face, FEAR. I was overwhelmed by the vast deep ocean and\
  \ became aware of my enduring phobia of water. The swimming lessons taken few months\
  \ back had not done much to alleviate my fears. I gulped some water. The brine induced\
  \ a series of fitful coughing. I tried to calm my nerves, but the fear had already\
  \ started to numb my senses. One reflex action and I surfaced. A couple of breaths\
  \ and few words of self-consolation later, I re-dived and the heartbreak followed.\n\
  I resurfaced panting and gasping for breath. I felt disappointment seeping into\
  \ my entire being. I was pulled up the boat. I removed my elaborate gear and resigned\
  \ to a quiet corner of the boat.\nMy brain was tired and disappointed, but the fire\
  \ in my heart refused to die down. This had been my childhood dream, scuba diving\
  \ in the Great Barrier Reef.\nBut the possibility of another chance, a last chance\
  \ was slim as the boat had already started its journey towards the coast. Helplessly,\
  \ I watched my dream fade off in the distance.\nA few minutes and a miracle later,\
  \ the boat anchored in a small reef and I was asked if I would like to dive again.\n\
  I was again in my diving gear, but this time with a new found zeal.\nI dived in,\
  \ the fear resurfaced, but I was not to be tamed again. I lived my dream, the bliss\
  \ was inexplicable, the experience unparalleled. As I removed my diving gear later,\
  \ I knew I was a different person. I had been blessed. I ditched the life jacket,\
  \ picked up a snorkel gear and snorkelled to my heart's content. I had finally made\
  \ friendship with water. I sat by the edge of the boat, my head resting peacefully\
  \ on my knee, a blissful smile on my face, my mind light and soaring like the sea-gulls\
  \ and my heart dancing like the wild untamed waves."
