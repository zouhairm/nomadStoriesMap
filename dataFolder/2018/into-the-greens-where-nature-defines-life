Text: "A rejuvenating vacation started from the wilderness of wayanad, situated in\
  \ Kerala,India. The trip started from palakkad around four in the evening through\
  \ the urban areas of Kerala. Throughout the journey the appreciable thing was the\
  \ hospitality of the locals towards the outsiders. I reached there by 8:30 pm and\
  \ found a beautiful resort to stay named 'rain country'. It was situated 3 km inside\
  \ the forest where the cool breeze provided the perfect ambience to my mood. The\
  \ next morning I started my site seeing from nearby situated tribal colony. They\
  \ introduced me their lifestyle and food habits which was quite interesting to observe.\
  \ After spending four hours with them I realised that they are the most happiest\
  \ people in the world without any luxuries. Pookot lake was my next destination.\
  \ It is a natural lake surrounded by hills and meadows, a correct spot for a relaxing\
  \ boat ride or fishing expedition. My next day started off with a trip to soojipara\
  \ which is a 38 km drive from my hotel. It is one among the many waterfalls found\
  \ in wayanad. These stand for their striking splendour among the dark and green\
  \ woods. I had to hike almost 3 km to reach the waterfalls. The gushing waterfalls\
  \ looked inviting but some government guards were around to warn the danger. There\
  \ I found a girl who lives there. She was not a professional guide, but she showcased\
  \ her knowledge in a beautiful way. Her way of expression itself revealed  that\
  \ she belongs to that region. I don't know if I was enjoying, her company or the\
  \ innocence hidden in her eyes. Anyway I took a picture of her to keep in my album.\
  \ \nLater in the evening I was treated with some exotic Malabar cuisine which included\
  \ rice bread, beef fry and chicken 65, a spicy dish sauteed with onions and coconut\
  \ oil. After the dinner, red wine and bonfire completed my day and it was time to\
  \ call it a night. The last day I headed for a more adventurous climb to annapara,\
  \ a hideaway mountain region cocooned in the lap of nature. The chembra peak here\
  \ is the highest in Wayanad, towering over 2100 metres. The way to the top of the\
  \ peak was really surreal, with bushes and brambles and loose stones coming my way.\
  \ But I believed that the hardest climb will give the mesmerizing view and I was\
  \ right. It ended on to a heart shaped lake. I dipped my legs into the cold water,\
  \ explored the forests adjoining the lake. The forests have been untouched by man\
  \ for centuries. Wayanad has many more places to explore and hopefully the next\
  \ time I shall be able to do it."
