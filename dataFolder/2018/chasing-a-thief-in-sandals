Text: "Running in sandals across the uneven bricks of Sel\xE7uk, Turkey is a challenge\
  \ that I doubt any set out to undertake. And yet, here I was, chasing a small child\
  \ through town, the Call to Prayer drifting behind me as I went. My breath came\
  \ hard out of my chest as I raced to catch the little speed demon parading as an\
  \ adorable Turkish child. We flew past shops filled with colorful fabrics, others\
  \ proudly displaying local fruit and wine, and always men sipping coffee and smoking\
  \ hookah. Just moments earlier I was enjoying these sites, sounds, and smells of\
  \ the village when her small face appeared in my vision and graced me with a squeaky\
  \ \u201Chello\u201D in English. When I knelt down to respond, her hand shot out\
  \ to grab my camera, and off she went. Challenge accepted: give chase to the \"\
  thief\" and regain the camera containing my memories of the last few months of my\
  \ travels.\n\nBeing this was her home, she was much more familiar with the area\
  \ than I was and I started losing distance as she danced around corners and into\
  \ alleyways my eyes would never have noticed. As I followed after her, I scolded\
  \ myself for being so careless, especially traveling in a new country. \"Thief\"\
  , I thought again but did not yell. The advice I received before departing the US\
  \ was on repeat in my brain: do not trust anyone, protect your belongings at all\
  \ times, do not talk to strangers. \n\nJust as I was losing all hope, I turned one\
  \ last bend in the road to a set of stairs heading up, one side ancient brick, the\
  \ other an open expanse of sky offering a dazzling view of the town. The girl stood\
  \ at the top, a triumphant smile on her face, and a rebellious glint in her eyes.\
  \  There was no flash when she took a photo, but the resulting picture did show\
  \ a laughing American standing in disbelief. \n\nThat set of stairs was a walk of\
  \ shame for me as I repeated the same warnings about travel in my head, but now\
  \ with a proper sense that those sentiments, while coming from a place of good intentions,\
  \ are to be taken as cautionary and not as rules. \n\nAt the top, my little photographer\
  \ was more than happy to return my property. She stood looking out over the vista,\
  \ hands on her hips in a pose reminiscent of Wonder Woman. I could feel the pride\
  \ emanating off her little body as she pointed out the view, one that I would have\
  \ missed if not for my \"thief\". \n\nTo punish her, I bought us flowers for our\
  \ hair and we strolled hand in hand taking pictures until it was time for me to\
  \ head home."
