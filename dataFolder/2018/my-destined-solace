Text: "Do you see me there in front of a tent in this wilderness writing this account?\
  \ yes! there I am a 24-year-old Indian girl. I know what you are thinking, where\
  \ am I? well, I am here on the banks of the Yellowstone lake camping with my newest\
  \ friend Burke. I know you have no have no idea of what am I talking about so, take\
  \ this flashback with me.\nI came here to the Butte, Montana to attend a three-day\
  \ conference at the Montana tech to present my paper. At the end of the conference,\
  \ the entire conference was gifted a 5 day trip to the Yellowstone national park.\
  \ I met Burke during the conference where he is a research scholar. The trip started\
  \ with a 7-hour road trip from Butte to the park. The old faithful inn was our hotel\
  \ for our stay. The hotel was nothing I had ever experienced, the logwood architecture\
  \ was breathtaking. Did I tell you it was -16\u02DAC? probably not, but now you\
  \ know it. \nThe first day of this journey was the experience of geysers and hot\
  \ springs for the first time. Ahead of my expectations, the geysers are an epitome\
  \ of surprises. We head straight to the old faithful and spectacular is the only\
  \ word I have for it. After a short walk to the upper geyser basin steam looked\
  \ like an opaque glass. Trust me on this if you like colors the bright blues and\
  \ greens will be eye-poppers. \nThe second day went by sighting the moose, badger,\
  \ otter and various animals. Since Burke decided to be a wildlife photographer I\
  \ resorted to taking selfies. what can a girl do? \nThe third day was a drive to\
  \ the mammoth which screamed unique. The cascading water was a master sculptor for\
  \ thousands of years to have made an art piece. We drove to the Roosevelt tower\
  \ and the drive to the Yellowstone River was surreal. The power nature had there\
  \ made me feel so weak, so menial.\nThe fourth day was a hike to the wapiti trailhead\
  \ to clear lake and then through the geothermal areas of Lilly pond lake. We ended\
  \ up camping around the lake butte for the night.\nThe fifth day was a camp on the\
  \ banks of Yellowstone Lake. The evenings dawn easily here. Exposing the diamond-laden\
  \ sky that I had no idea was this-worldly. The expanse of the sky makes me feel\
  \ curious about the future and inquisitive about the past.\nComing back to the present\
  \ I'll be leaving soon retracing my path from Butte to Salt Lake City airport to\
  \ Heathrow to New Delhi. Hoping to come back to this place where silence lies at\
  \ its core and nature has charms like nowhere else and a friend like Burke like\
  \ no one else."
