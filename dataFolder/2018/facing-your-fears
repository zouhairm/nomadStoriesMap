Text: "Mary felt amazing when she was on top of Mt. Everest. She couldn\u2019t believe\
  \ her eyes, everything looked beautiful to herself; she was always afraid of heights.\
  \ But, not today she was able to climb Mt. Everest without hesitation. It all started\
  \ with a dream; to overcome her fear of heights, a dream to be the first in her\
  \ family to climb the highest mountain. In her deepest of sleeps, she always imagined\
  \ herself being on Mt. Everest, but as soon as her eyes opened her dreams were impossible\
  \ to turn into reality. Mary was used to her life full of routines, she hated change.\
  \ People often told her that she needs change in her life. She would shrug off the\
  \ comments and continued to her path.  \nLately, she is getting annoyed of her life\
  \ of routines. She hates her 9-5 to job; being stuck in a little box suffocated\
  \ her now. She loves her dream world with a light blue sky and seeing snow everywhere.\
  \ Her job gave her a chance to win a trip to any country she wanted to travel. She\
  \ decided that she will go to Mt. Everest, she took her best friend Cameron along\
  \ with her. Mary wanted to overcome her fears and wanted to fulfill her dream. She\
  \ was always afraid of heights. Every night she had a dream she was on top of the\
  \ mountain, but in reality it never happened. But she wanted to change that, she\
  \ decided she needed change in her life. She started packing for her trip and heading\
  \ towards her dream\nMary looked at Cameron, and then she took a slow step. \u201C\
  I\u2019m next to you Mary, don\u2019t be afraid.\u201D Mary nodded her head and\
  \ continued to climb. A few minutes later she saw the sky near her, she took one\
  \ more climb and she was on the top. When she climbed the top, she started to scream,\
  \ laugh and cry. She was feeling a mix of emotions, she couldn\u2019t believe her\
  \ eyes. She completed her dream, she looked around and she noticed everything was\
  \ exactly the same just like a dream. A minute later she saw Cameron, she ran up\
  \ to him and gave him a hug. \u201CThank you Cameron I couldn\u2019t have done this\
  \ without you.\u201D \u201CNo, Mary you did this yourself you are incredible. Mary\
  \ looked at Cameron and gave him a kiss on his lips."
