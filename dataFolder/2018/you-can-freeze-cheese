Text: "\u201CYou can freeze cheese?\u201D I asked, truly shocked. \n Leon laughed,\
  \ \u201COf course! And ham,\u201D he showed me one of the frost-sheened packets.\n\
  \ In a country as hot as Namibia, my question must have been as strange to him as\
  \ his had been to me. He\u2019d asked why I wasn\u2019t married - I was, after all,\
  \ over thirty and on a downward slope to the grave, and why I wasn\u2019t fat -\
  \ like the other non-African visitors to the farm. The real shocker for him was\
  \ when he asked what religion I was \u2013 and I could only truthfully answer, \u2018\
  I\u2019m not.\u2019\n I gazed at the packets of processed food, sacks of rice, and\
  \ plastic-wrapped sugary sweetness \u2013 when sustenance has such a long way to\
  \ come I guess it has to be well preserved, and like the countries electricity,\
  \ supply came mainly from South Africa. \n \u201CI\u2019ll show you the recycling,\u201D\
  \ he said, motioning me to follow. And this is where Namibia gives back, albeit\
  \ with slight carbon footprint. The farm, like many others, gathers its recycling,\
  \ takes it into Windhoek (with as many people picked up along the way as the Toyota\
  \ can carry without tipping over), where it\u2019s cleaned and sorted, then put\
  \ onto trucks and taken back to South Africa to be recycled.  \nLeon was very proud\
  \ of their effort, and it was needed \u2013 the one thing the farm was never short\
  \ of was bottles of alcohol. The bar was the coolest place to be, nestled under\
  \ a large thatched roof, perfect except for the dive-bombing moths that came out\
  \ when the sun went down. Volunteers (like me), local workers and guests could all\
  \ indulge in an icy Savannah Dry cider, whilst dodging the nocturnal battalion.\
  \ I would politely ask about their trip, whilst Leon always wanted to know which\
  \ soccer team they supported.\n After lunch I fixed the dial-up internet connection,\
  \ and squeamishly melted into the wall as a wasps nest was removed from under the\
  \ office desk.\n \u201CI think the Christmas tree\u2019s arrived.\u201D The boss\
  \ smiled and adjusted his glasses, handing me a box of worn but glittering Christmas\
  \ decorations in reply. \n I stepped out into a wall of heat, to find Leon already\
  \ had the tree half-out of the truck; twenty feet of dusky greenery threatening\
  \ to flatten him. I hurried over to help.\n \u201CWhat is it?\u201D I asked, gazing\
  \ up at the yellow pompom flowers dotted between the thorns.\n \u201CAcacia Karroo,\u201D\
  \ he replied proudly, taking the dog-eared box from my hands with a grin. Together\
  \ we hung baubles and strung tinsel. Leon laughed.\n \u201CWhat?\u201D I asked.\n\
  \ \u201CDidn\u2019t know you could freeze cheese...\u201D he grinned. I\u2019d made\
  \ his day."
