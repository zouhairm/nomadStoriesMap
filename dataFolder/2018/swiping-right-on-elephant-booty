Text: "Thoreau went to the woods to live deliberately. I went to the jungle to escape\
  \ a Tinder addiction. \n\nMy plan was to wash away my right swipes while rafting\
  \ down Malaysia\u2019s Tembeling River. The trip began on the side of the road.\
  \ It was hot. And there I was, walking down the road with a bag strapped to my back.\
  \ I stuck out my thumb when cars passed. But most of them didn't stop. They just\
  \ rolled slowly by, eyeing the strange white specimen.\n\nEventually some loggers\
  \ picked me up. Then I caught a ride from a toothless jungle mechanic whose dream\
  \ was to start the Malaysian version of Metallica. Half a day of hitchhiking and\
  \ I arrived at a small village. From there I walked. As I slogged upstream my sphincter\
  \ began to loosen. Hitchhiking on logging roads was a rush\u2014you didn't know\
  \ which psycho was gonna pick you up next!\u2014but it also caused some sphincter-clenching\
  \ stress. I didn't like it when the Malaysians stared at me like a zoo beast. But\
  \ out there on the river, trudging through quicksand, I had a few moments of real\
  \ peace. Just me and a handful of buffalo. Sphincter bliss.\n\nAfter 3 days of marching\
  \ upstream I inflated my raft and began paddling. As soon as I got on the river\
  \ I started laughing. The ease of floating downstream in a big balloon seemed ridiculous.\
  \ The laughing stopped when I hit the first rapid. I swung around a sharp curve,\
  \ dodged a boulder and slipped down a little slide into a wave train. Over the next\
  \ hour I navigated my way down some challenging rapids.\n\nWhen the whitewater turned\
  \ brown again I settled in for a long float. I sat motionless in my raft, hardly\
  \ making a sound. None of the jungle beasts could hear me coming. It wasn't until\
  \ I was right on top of them that they would realize I was there and charge headlong\
  \ into the underbrush. But the vegetation was so thick that I couldn't see them.\n\
  \nAs the sun went down the jungle crescendoed into an all-embracing drone. Then\
  \ hell broke loose on shore. Another beast had become aware of my presence. I clicked\
  \ on my headlamp and saw green vegetation undulating. I could hear the beast tearing\
  \ through the underbrush, getting farther and farther away. I didn't know what it\
  \ was. But it sounded huge.\n\nI turned off my headlamp and continued floating.\
  \ An hour later pandemonium broke out in the bushes. It was like a firecracker of\
  \ snapping branches. I clicked on my headlamp. A flood of dopamine cooked my brain.\
  \ There it was. A big beautiful elephant booty disappearing into the bushes. I swiped\
  \ right."
