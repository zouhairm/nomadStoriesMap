Text: "You\u2019ve heard the stories about mothers picking up cars when their babies\
  \ were pinned beneath\u2014it\u2019s a marvel the things we\u2019re capable of when\
  \ put to the test. But some tests just can\u2019t be prepared for; consider my first\
  \ surgery on a cat. I\u2019d been on the Micronesian island of Kosrae for just a\
  \ few days when my friend Jeanne got the call: Naomi, the daughter of an out-of-town\
  \ friend, had a cat whose cheek had been pierced with a fishhook. Could Jeanne help?\n\
  \nKosrae has no vets, so the request wasn\u2019t unwarranted\u2014just unsettling.\
  \ Remove a cat-caught hook? Jeanne turned to me, and I turned to run, but the door\
  \ was shut. We nervously assembled some tools: needle-nose pliers, yes, vise grips,\
  \ no, wire cutters, yes, hammer, no\u2014what did we know about feline dentistry?\
  \ We even brought along some dental picks that Jeanne had; maybe we could do a cleaning\
  \ too.\n\nAt Naomi\u2019s house, Snowball the cat had sequestered himself under\
  \ the bed, probably having heard Naomi\u2019s phone conversation. We snagged him\
  \ and brought him out to the living room couch, all lights ablaze. Recognizing that\
  \ the major blame could be pinned on me, Jeanne had decided that I would be the\
  \ actual surgeon. She wrapped Snowball in a large white towel, encircling in a respectful\
  \ grip the frightened beast\u2019s four fiercely clawed limbs.\n\nJeanne managed\
  \ to keep Snowball towel-bound while also pulling back his jaws. Indeed, the hook\
  \ was completely piercing his cheek. As luck had it, the big curve of the hook was\
  \ outside his cheek, and the single barb inside. I thought that if I could just\
  \ grip it from the inside of his mouth and curl the end of the hook around, I could\
  \ pull the big-hook end back through the existing wound. I also thought I could\
  \ golf.\n\nSnowball\u2019s eyes flared with cat fire when I began to tug at the\
  \ hook, twisting it unsuccessfully about. He was kind enough to merely flash his\
  \ incisors at me for future reference. OK, can\u2019t angle the hook out; must go\
  \ to Plan B, cut it in half. With the needle-nose gripping the hook from inside,\
  \ and the wire cutters clamping the hook on the outside, I gave a good squeeze.\
  \ Nothing. The cat kicked in his towel, indicating that he had a play date elsewhere.\n\
  \nIntern Naomi wiped my face before my next sweaty attempt. With a sharp click,\
  \ both pieces fell free. The cat scampered off, and both Jeanne and I considered\
  \ heart surgery for our own pounding chests. We\u2019ve heard that Snowball\u2019\
  s fine, but when he gets an arrowhead in his paw, I\u2019ll be gone fishing."
