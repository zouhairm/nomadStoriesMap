Text: "Costa Rica is said to be one of the most beautiful and picturesque countries\
  \ in the world. Its flora and landscape are unprecedented in South America and the\
  \ further behind you leave a modern world the more awe inspiring the country becomes.\
  \ While traveling from San Jos\xE9 to the bush, the fog in the high mountains and\
  \ the patter of rain on the tallest of trees was rivaled only by the sprawling banana\
  \ farms and the brief glimpses of the ocean coast. All of this would have made for\
  \ the most amazing vacation if not for the fact that we embarked on this life changing\
  \ journey during the rainy season. While the daily drizzles and nightly downpours\
  \ do cut down on the mosquito bites, they make for extremely muggy weather. While\
  \ we made the best of it and had good times, the best adventures were yet to come.\
  \ On the day of our departure to San Heredia and back to a more modern world, the\
  \ rain proved to be less an inconvenience and more a huge obstacle. Due to the intense\
  \ amount rainfall, our mode of transportation was unequipped to reach our location.\
  \ We had to improvise and when you improvise in the bush it turns out the bus you\
  \ were expecting is a cattle truck. In we herded ourselves in the back of a rickety\
  \ vehicle and forged the overflowing streams of the village, make our way, as close\
  \ as we could to our bus. 2 miles from said exit mode, we hit a bump in our plan,\
  \ the water became too high even for the cattle truck. Well, no bother, we will\
  \ enjoy the countryside all the more. Disembarking from the truck, we began to walk,\
  \ or slosh rather, ever closer to the bus. It was slow going. Bags were carried,\
  \ hairstyles compromised, shoes lost, and when were tantalizingly close, our final\
  \ obstacle hit. A river, washing away the road, barricading us from the bus. We\
  \ must cross it. Creating a tether line across the hindrance we forded the water,\
  \ getting all the wetter in the process and finally, finally reached our savior.\
  \ The Bus, the glorious bus. And the danger was done, the adventure over, the ride\
  \ was uneventful. But in the end the rain was a blessing, it caused landslides,\
  \ closing roads, causing us to take different routes back to the city. Twelve hours\
  \ of passing plantations, driving through mountain ranges, enjoying the freshest\
  \ of fresh air spilling through the open window, stopping at fruit stands that will\
  \ change the way you look at life. Sometimes the worst experiences end up making\
  \ for the best adventures, you just have to have the patience for them."
