Text: "Motivated by heartbreak and the need to get away I had decided to embark on\
  \ my first solo journey to Thailand.  I thought there was no better way to conquer\
  \ the fear of loneliness than to dive right into the heart and soul of it. However,\
  \ loneliness never did quite find me. Instead, I realized that strapping a backpack\
  \ to my body changed how people interacted with me. Everyone was always curious\
  \ about where I was from and if kindness was a currency then Thailand was rich in\
  \ it. \n\nI had tucked myself away in a tiny one-person cabin with a view of the\
  \ lush Thailand jungle and blue-tinted mountain backdrop for only 10 dollars a night\
  \ in Chang Dao. I had spent my time there eating every variation of noodles I could\
  \ find at all the restaurants I could afford, bathing with the locals in the natural\
  \ hot springs and getting lost on my rented pedal bike as I rode through miles of\
  \ open fields and farmlands while the hot December sun baked my skin. \n\nWhen I\
  \ was ready to head to Chang Mai I had asked the receptionist if he could hail me\
  \ a cab down to the bus station, but instead, he asked another Thai couple that\
  \ had been checking out at the same time as me if they could give me a ride. They\
  \ offered to take me on the two-hour journey to Chang Mai. As a solo traveler, especially\
  \ a female traveler, you do often contemplate, \u201CWill this decision end in my\
  \ murder?\u201D However, with a baby seat strapped in their backseat and a smile\
  \ that welcomed me, a stranger to them as well, into their lives for the next two\
  \ hours I felt the risk was mutual. They hardly spoke any English, but in that car\
  \ ride, I learned about their baby that was staying with an aunt while they vacationed\
  \ in the town where we met, what they did for a living and about their plans to\
  \ visit the US one day. We drove through traffic back into town becoming more like\
  \ friends and less like strangers with every mile we spent together. When we got\
  \ back to Chiang Mai they refused to just drop me off at any corner and drove around\
  \ until they found the train station I was looking for and they even came into the\
  \ station to help me buy my ticket to ensure I got the cheaper local\u2019s price.\n\
  \nKindness doesn\u2019t need a spoken language, it is translated through actions.\
  \ And awkward smiles. And a hug goodbye. I quickly learned that loneliness is fleeting\
  \ in a traveler's paradise. My broken heart was put back together through the kindness\
  \ of strangers and tasty noodles."
