Text: "\"You won't dare drop your summer classes that we paid for!\" exclaimed my\
  \ dad, shook by the thunderbolt I had just sprung at him. I had to make a choice\
  \ between my career and my dream, and obviously, I chose the latter. The invitation\
  \ to trot and blog about my adventures in Nepal through a government sponsorship\
  \ wasn't one that I took for granted. Little did I know, that this trip was going\
  \ to be where the drift in the stream of my life would occur.\n\nBefore I could\
  \ take time to process the news, I had started packing my backpack. 'Twenty days;\
  \ would I need a towel? And perhaps a thin blanket to keep me warm' were only few\
  \ of the thoughts that consumed me. In a week, I was about to be backpacking in\
  \ across the world from USA, to where nature's pinnacles lay. Was it the part of\
  \ the Himalayan Annapurna Circuit trek, or the accomplished travel writers all around\
  \ me, that gave me this adrenalin rush? I still wonder.\n\nAll I knew was that I\
  \ was the youngest darer to pounce onto this trip. Trekking through the wild for\
  \ three days had so mysteriously seduced my ways. Even though I would be the last\
  \ one following the hustle of ten experienced adventurers and our witty local guide,\
  \ Nema, I would never quite catch up, uphill. At every rest-station, there would\
  \ be these oddly cheerful bunch of strangers toward whom I felt a growing affinity.\
  \ \n\n\"What would you like today? Some dal bhati and water?\" Nema would ask with\
  \ a warm smile, as I'd pant with dripping sweat. Night fell and intimate conversations\
  \ in our shelters birthed. The two of my roommates were Heidi, a travel writer form\
  \ Italy, and Marissa, a travel journalist from Cambodia. I do not know if it was\
  \ the altitude sickness, the excessive dal bhati in our systems, or just the lack\
  \ of choice, that helped us bond over tales of our voyages in spite of the unpleasant\
  \ smell from our drenched clothes. \n\nWith stomach aches from laughs that we shared,\
  \ we were set to further our journey every early dawn. Every time we crossed a village,\
  \ my heart humbled from the passerby's who bowed their heads smiling \"Namaste!\"\
  . Galvanized, I would capture these fleeting moments in my camera and their essence\
  \ in my journal.\n\nI was at the airport unready to fly back home, when it hit me:\
  \ Why am I thinking twice while leaving Nepal behind, when I didn't care to think\
  \ even once when I was leaving the summer classes at my university? I came back\
  \ the first day of fall semester of junior year, and switched my major to my calling:\
  \ Writing."
