Text: "As a teenager from white middle-class America, I had come to expect a high\
  \ degree of predictability from public transportation.\n\nThis, I came to learn,\
  \ was not the case on bus rides from the rainforest of southeastern Peru into Cusco.\
  \ About a month in to living at a rainforest conservation project, a friend of mine\
  \ and I decided to take a weekend trip to Cusco. \n\nThe bus was supposed to pick\
  \ us up at 9 pm, drive through the night and arrive early the next morning. So naturally,\
  \ it arrived at about 11 pm. As the bus forged ahead along the narrow jungle road,\
  \ I tried to sleep to forget the shear cliff face out the window. Somewhere in the\
  \ middle of the night, I awoke to that common travel realization the bus is no longer\
  \ moving and you have no idea why and it\u2019s unlikely anyone is going to explain\
  \ it to you.\n\nA rockslide about a mile up was blocking all vehicles from passing.\
  \ As the sun came up, we ventured out of the bus to assess the scene. It didn\u2019\
  t look good, and we had no idea what the rockslide recovery process would look like.\
  \ \n\nWe ended up siding with the few people who seemed to be adopting a do-it-yourself\
  \ rockslide motto. We started walking. First straight down the side of the mountain,\
  \ understanding from a cursory conversation with a couple people outside our bus\
  \ that Cusco was essentially downhill. Fortunately we didn\u2019t get very far.\
  \ Fortunately, because I have no idea what would have happened if we had made it\
  \ into the valley and attempted to cross the river carving through it.\n\nBack up\
  \ on the road, we tried a different strategy. Climb over the rockslide and take\
  \ the road on foot. In the first of many travel experiences that would cement in\
  \ me a trust in humans and in the precarious nature of traveling in the haphazard\
  \ way of a teenager yearning for anything interesting, anything beautiful, we ended\
  \ up scoring a ride. We had passed a group of people walking along the road who\
  \ told us their friend was coming for them in a truck and if they passed us again\
  \ on our way down, they\u2019d give us a lift. Not half an hour later, they did\
  \ indeed. My friend and I hopped in to the bed of a small, white pick up truck and\
  \ braced ourselves for the bumpy ride down the mountain next to two young parents\
  \ and their brightly clothed daughter. \n\nOne taxi and another long walk later,\
  \ we were having breakfast at a small caf\xE9 in the Plaza de San Blas, easily the\
  \ smelliest ones in there, but grinning widely, thinking we hoped to earn all our\
  \ breakfasts in such a way."
