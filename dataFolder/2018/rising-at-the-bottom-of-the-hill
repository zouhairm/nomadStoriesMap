Text: "Te Araroa: The most easterly point of New Zealand, and home to the first sunrise\
  \ in the world. A 22km unsealed road takes you to the starting point of a short\
  \ but steep climb to the East Cape lighthouse, 700 steps up to 154m above sea level.\
  \ The never-ending stretch of South Pacific Ocean spans ahead, teasing your imagination\
  \ with the possibility to spot a pod of dolphins or a family of whales swimming\
  \ below.\nNew Zealand is country filled with natural beauty, and roughing it in\
  \ a tent seems an unbeatable way to experience it. The country rich with heritage\
  \ is like an untouched haven, forgotten by the fear and threats that has consumed\
  \ the rest of the world. Dramatic fjords, enchanting forests, and volcanic thermal\
  \ springs makes for only a short leap for the mind to understand the fantastic stories\
  \ of the indigenous Maori people.\nWe\u2019d heard about the East Cape lighthouse\
  \ from another traveller in a previous campsite, where you could hike up and be\
  \ the first people in the world to see the sunrise. The first people in the world\
  \ to embrace the new day. What we were expecting, was something magical. The perfect\
  \ way to end our 3-month travelling experience. \nWe woke a little later than planned,\
  \ meaning that our early morning hike turned into more of a race against time. It\
  \ was freezing, the earth not yet warmed. The battery of my headtorch gave up shortly\
  \ after we set off, meaning I was nearly blind in the mad dash under the trees.\
  \ We got to the top just in time, full of adrenaline and ready to take in what I\
  \ was sure was going to be an overwhelmingly serene experience.\nDisappointingly,\
  \ the sky was filled with clouds. We could barely see the sun, the wind was bitter,\
  \ and my companion, Russell, and I were in bad spirits. We stayed for the sunrise,\
  \ but started our descent feeling frustrated and disappointed. \nWe turned the corner\
  \ away from the cliff, and that\u2019s when we saw them. A herd of Kaimanawa horses\
  \ \u2013 the wild horse of New Zealand. Forty years ago they were hunted to the\
  \ point of near extinction, yet now with numbers increasing, they stood calmly before\
  \ us, unobtrusive of the dawn. Usually, these horses roam the country further up\
  \ north, in a desert area known to scientists as the wasteland, but on this special\
  \ morning, they were here, with the newly risen sun creeping out from behind the\
  \ cliff and landing on their backs, illuminating their manes and breath with its\
  \ warm light.\nI had expected to feel magic that morning, but this was in a way\
  \ I\u2019d least expected."
