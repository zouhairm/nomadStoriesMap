Text: "The steep, winding road stretches out in front of me and disappears into one\
  \ of those painted corners that I\u2019ve come to know Landour by. \nAfter a day\
  \ of trekking and climbing, the endless hilly road asks far too much.\nI breathe\
  \ out a sigh into the chilly Landour air \u2013 wisps of snow into the velvet-blue.\
  \ \n\nMy friend nudges me, \u201CHe is your childhood hero. We must do this.\u201D\
  \ \nAnd so, we trudge on. \n\nThe air is moody here.  It greets me as a soft lulling\
  \ caress, as stinging slaps against my face, and at times, just one icy finger pressing\
  \ on my nose until I feel sure I\u2019m breathing in frost. \n\nA group of merrymaking\
  \ children stop and point at my ridiculously bright cowboy-hat which I had bought\
  \ from one of the Mussoorie street-shops. I narrow my eyes at them in challenge\
  \ and they wait for my move, it would seem. I take out my phone and make a motion\
  \ as if to take their picture, and sure enough, they titter off laughing in their\
  \ make-believe panic.\n\nThis seems to have warmed us to the elders.\n\n\u201CKaha\
  \ ja rahe ho?\u201D Where are you going? A lanky grandpa in a white kurta and a\
  \ beige sweater comes up to us.\n\u201CThe house of Ruskin Bond, Nanaji.\u201D\n\
  He sweeps an arm in the direction of the road with a graceful flourish like that\
  \ of a magician.  \u201CAur upar jaana hai, beta\u201D You have to go further on,\
  \ child. \nI slump on a nearby bench where sits another grandpa in a yellow sweater.\n\
  \u201CYou are tired, child. Why go up? I have many stories to tell as well.\u201D\
  \n\u201CGrandpa, I must go. I am a big fan. I will return for your story.\u201D\
  \ \nHe tut-tuts in teasing disapproval. \u201CGo then, if you must. Dhyaan se, kuch\
  \ hai hi nahi.\u201D He glanced at my skinny arms. \u201CUr jaogi.\u201D Be careful,\
  \ there is nothing in your body, you will fly away.\n\nMaybe it is because of what\
  \ he said; but it does seem as if the crisp mountain wind carries us to his house.\
  \  \n\nPerched on a hill in a bungalow with white-washed walls and an old-world\
  \ charm, lives the storyteller who was my childhood. \nI knock hesitantly. Fear\
  \ grips my nerves. \nThe door creaks open. \u201CHe is not home today, I\u2019m\
  \ very sorry.\u201D A girl says. \n\nIn the heaviness of my heart, I feel the dusk\
  \ set in. It is our last day in Mussoorie, and I am still on the quest. What for?\n\
  \n*  *  *\nThe grandpa in the yellow sweater and a monkey-cap is still sitting on\
  \ the wooden bench. Hearing our approach, he looks up with dancing eyes, and his\
  \ barely toothed mouth softens into a smile. \n\nHe nods once, twice as if to ask...\n\
  \u201CHow about a story now?\u201D"
