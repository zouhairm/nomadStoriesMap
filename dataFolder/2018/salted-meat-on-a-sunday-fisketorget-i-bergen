Text: "The reindeer and white whale meat stretches out in front of me, displayed on\
  \ big trays of ice cubes balanced precariously on what looks like one esky stacked\
  \ on top of another. The little stall is so insignificant that we almost walked\
  \ straight past it, were it not for the smell of raw meat drifting past us on the\
  \ afternoon breeze.\n'Reindeer, reindeer! Or whale, if you prefer!'\nWhale? Are\
  \ my ears deceiving me?\nBut no, and neither are my eyes, once I've turned to look\
  \ at the caller. He stands in front of a selection of the 'finest reindeer meat\
  \ in Norway' (I'm told), from sausages to raw steaks. The whale meat is dark red\
  \ and glistening in the sun, with small cubes of whitish whale blubber interspersed\
  \ throughout the display.\n'You want to try this?' the man asks me, holding out\
  \ a piece of reindeer sausage. It looks like salami but has a wilder smell\u2026\
  \ earthy, almost. It's tantalising in its exoticness. He tells us that in the past,\
  \ whale meat was a cheap and common food for Norwegian locals up until the 70s and\
  \ 80s, when it became more controversial and therefore less popular. But it is still\
  \ a 'cultural dish' that we (as unknowing, Anglo tourists, of course) 'absolutely\
  \ must try'.\n'So, reindeer or the whale?'\n\nWe're in Bergen, Norway's second largest\
  \ city of around 200,000 people that rests in a nestle of islands on the country's\
  \ west coast. It's August, and the city is alive with that distinctive feel of summer\
  \ - warm nights spent by the water, music and laughter spilling from the open doors\
  \ of the restaurants and bars that line the little port. It's almost 9pm but the\
  \ harbour side fisketorget (fish market) is bustling with tourists ordering their\
  \ fish and chips dinners, or a plate of oysters with a glass of wine for sunset.\
  \ \n\nBergen is beautiful in that classic storybook kind of way: the coloured buildings\
  \ with their perfectly pointed roofs mark the water's edge, whilst Mount Fl\xF8\
  yen rises up behind them in all its green glory. Tomorrow, we will walk the 15km\
  \ Vidden track from Mt Ulriken to Mt Fl\xF8yen and marvel at the rolling greenery\
  \ and rocky trails, infinite in their ability to make you feel small. Then, we'll\
  \ reach the Fl\xF8yen summit and feel like the giant from Jack and the Beanstalk,\
  \ looking down upon the city from above. \n\nFor now, though, my immediate future\
  \ is unclear. Reindeer or whale? Both or neither?"
