Text: "\u201CI am not a prostitute, dear, I just get paid for sex sometimes.\u201D\
  \ \nNow, you can imagine how those words sounded to the 21-year-old-feminist me\
  \ who just got ripped off with 780, 000 baht for drinks by the very same tiny lady.\
  \ \n\u201CDon\xB4t wrinkle, your skin will start breaking.\u201D A piece of my forehead\
  \ might as well have fallen off, so deep was my frown. She ordered two tequilas\
  \ and set me down on a table. \nIt\xB4s a late April night in Phuket. Mixed with\
  \ the tourist swarm, who consumed deep-fried cheese and watery cocktails, you could\
  \ see women walking down the street with colorful clothes and fans in their hands.\
  \ In Thai society over 1% of women have been prostitutes at some point of their\
  \ lives. The sex industry is huge \u2013 every year thousands of males visit the\
  \ country with the sole aim to use women for their pleasure. \nMay Nan had just\
  \ turned 18 last month but jugged down her tequila like a pro. And as I would learn\
  \ later, did other things professionally as well. Her story probably doesn\u2019\
  t differ so much from numerous others. Her parents, although poor in income, were\
  \ rich in offspring and May, as the oldest child, had to provide for the family.\
  \ She already knew that rice production didn\u2019t pay off so her next choice was\
  \ the adultery business aka luring tourists into buying ridiculously expensive drinks\
  \ and then maybe sharing a bed with her. \n\u201CI am not forced to sleep with a\
  \ man\u201D, she explained, \u201CI don\xB4t have a pimp or something. Everything\
  \ I earn is for me. And if I don\xB4t like someone, I just walk away.\u201D \nAnd\
  \ if she likes someone too much? He turns into an oversea sweetheart whom she sends\
  \ photos and charges nothing. We woke up Joe in the middle of the night all the\
  \ way up in Australia. He nicely tried to shrug us off and fall back into slumber.\n\
  \u201CDo you love me Joe?\u201D, May Nan asked quietly.\n\u201COf course, I do.\
  \ Talk to you tomorrow May.\u201D \nWalking down that path is a solemn and tiring\
  \ journey and I couldn\u2019t help but wonder:\n\u201CMay, are you happy?\u201D\n\
  Her faced changed color from green to red as the lights of the bar turned around.\
  \ Sitting in the shadows, with her chick leaned against her knuckles, she imagined\
  \ a future where she has a man who loves her and a small cottage to house her children.\
  \ \nWalking towards my hostel I looked around. The fiesta continued \u2013 drunk\
  \ tourists, men twirling hands around beautiful girls, heat and disco light. Nothing\
  \ had changed over the past hour on the street and yet I was seeing so much more\
  \ sad eyes looking at me from the corners."
