Text: "I remember watching the famous \u2018City Of God\u2019, when I was 16 and feeling\
  \ completely enamoured with Rio De Janeiro. It\u2019s a familiar story I\u2019ve\
  \ since heard repeated by many tourists wanting to live-out their own \u2018Cidade\
  \ de Deus\u2019 experience. \n\nIpanema and Sugar Loaf all part of the same romanticised\
  \ fantasy, choreographed to the same routine.\n\nSoak up the Marvellous city, take\
  \ a picture with Cristo, and don\u2019t forget to drink a Caipirinha while you\u2019\
  re at it.\n\nEager to get my very own slice of real Brazilian culture, I decided\
  \ to go on a tour of Santa Marta Favela located in Rio's south zone.\n\n\u2018Visited\
  \ by stars such as Madonna, Michael Jackson and Vin Diesel\u2019, the website reads.\n\
  \nAfter meeting at the petrol station, and exchanging some anxious looks with each\
  \ other, the tour begins. \n\nWalking through narrow paths, we\u2019re greeted by\
  \ children and old women sitting outside their homes.\n\n\u2018Bom Dia, Bom Dia\u2019\
  \ they say cheerfully. \n\nI imagine their warm greeting said over and over again\
  \ to hundreds of turistas each day. \n\nI imagine groups passing through my home\
  \ in Australia, and I mentally compare our infrastructure for a moment.\n\nElectrical\
  \ cables stick out above us, tangled amongst each other like balls of yarn.\n\n\
  Rubbish is piled up and covered with sheets; the smell piercing through and hitting\
  \ us at each turn. \n\nI begin to close my eyes and try to hear the familiar sound\
  \ of the cuica that features in almost every Samba song, but I\u2019m interrupted\
  \ by an insistent eight-year-old named Bruno.\n\nHolding a soccer ball he pleads\
  \ with our guide Diego, to let us play with him and his friends. \n\nSo we play,\
  \ and while I feel guilty living out this favela clich\xE9, I also can\u2019t help\
  \ but relish in it, taking photos and hi-fiving alongside everyone else. \n\nThe\
  \ kids are rewarded with treats from the cantina, and I notice Bruno watching us\
  \ leave through the fence. His small hands grip through the wire, and I can\u2019\
  t work out what his expression means.\n\nDid they even want to play with us? I wonder.\
  \ \n\nAnd so, this is the reality of favela tourism it seems, getting a glimpse\
  \ into the lives of others and observing it, but powerless in a lot of ways to change\
  \ it. Leaving in a taxi, I clutch the shirt I bought, hand-painted by a child about\
  \ Bruno\u2019s age. I put my headphones in and sound of the cuica kicks in as the\
  \ City of God Soundtrack plays out the adventure I'd been dreaming of. I finally\
  \ close my eyes and a tear rolls down my cheek. It is like the movie I thought,\
  \ only much too real."
