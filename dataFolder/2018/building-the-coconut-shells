Text: "Building the Coconut Shells\nIn Solomon Islands, coconut shells can be a game\
  \ in village playground, a colorful handmade purse \u2013 and a lot of what Solomon\
  \ Islanders have.\n\nCoconut shells, Sela Kokonat in Solomon Islands Pijin, is what\
  \ I learnt the first thing arrived in the village in Solomon Islands. I entered\
  \ the village with Eric and his son Zonia who live there, I see kids are playing\
  \ coconut shells building game. They cut around 8 to 10 empty coconut shells in\
  \ half, spilt into two teams, girls and boys, you will have 3 times to throw a ball\
  \ to touch the shells to start the game, then run for the other team not to throw\
  \ the ball on you (or you\u2019re out), during the game work with your team to pile\
  \ up all the coconut shells to win the game.\n\nThey let me start the game, for\
  \ some miss-understanding, I threw the ball on coconut shells, then run as fast\
  \ as I can into the beach, (then they are all laughing because I couldn\u2019t have\
  \ any chance to help my team to pile up the coconut shells in this way.) When I\
  \ finally got close to pile up the shells, I was very focus, but I had somebody\
  \ tapping on my shoulder with the ball saying: OUT!\n\nWe had a lot of fun in the\
  \ village this afternoon, everybody played together in different age, all bare foot,\
  \ we were all having fun in this cloudy rainy afternoon, with a little of sunshine\
  \ through the sky, with no electricity, no TV, no any advanced technology (or no\
  \ technology), no internet, no connection to the outside world. I asked Eric how\
  \ do they make their living, he told me they build their own house, they do fishing\
  \ and gardening, if someday the weather is bad or they feel like taking a break\
  \ when they have enough food, they rest. \n\nI walked into the village thinking\
  \ they have nothing, and I left thinking they have everything. Life is very simple,\
  \ and beautiful. I bought a little handmade colorful coconut shell purse at Honiara\
  \ as a collection of my very personal coconut shell moment, and continue my travel\
  \ journey."
