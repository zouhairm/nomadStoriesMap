Text: "\u201CHvar er Reykjadalur?\u201D I ask the gas station cashier in broken, poorly\
  \ pronounced Icelandic, practiced on the flight from New York to Reykjavik. He looks\
  \ at me with a slight smile that says, \u201CYour attempt is embarrassing, but thank\
  \ you for trying\u201D. He responds (in perfect English) that Reykjadalur is about\
  \ 12 kilometers up the road, I thank him and return to the car. I\u2019d heard many\
  \ times that I wouldn\u2019t need to speak the language as almost everyone would\
  \ speak English, but I felt compelled to know at least some. Icelandic is not an\
  \ easy language, in my week there I was able to say \u201CHotdog\u201D and a few\
  \ place names. I made my way up the winding road to the trail. It was the final\
  \ day before I returned to Keflavik to catch my flight home. I decided early on\
  \ I really wanted to see Reykjadalur, a geothermal river nestled above the hamlet\
  \ of Hverager\xF0i. It was early and, though I knew September was starting to get\
  \ cold I hadn\u2019t experienced it until I left the warmth of the Ford Fiesta and\
  \ started to trek up the up the path to the river. The air was thick with fog and\
  \ when I reached the top of the hill above the parking lot it started to rain. I\
  \ kept on, by this point my view was almost entirely obscured. Occasionally I managed\
  \ glimpses through it, seeing I was climbing a mountain pass, and when it parted,\
  \ waterfalls tumbling into the valley below. The rain came in sheets, drenching\
  \ me and seeping through my jacket. I realized that I had been walking for what\
  \ seemed too long. I stood there, unable to discern a path in the fog. I\u2019d\
  \ took a wrong turn and went a mile too far. For all my sopping misery I did eventually\
  \ make it, passing bubbling pools and the acrid smell of sulphur. It snaked its\
  \ way steaming through the valley. I figured I wasn\u2019t getting any dryer, so\
  \ I dropped my clothes where I stood and jumped in. The water was hot and a welcome\
  \ change from the frigid rain. Sitting on the bank it struck me, the entire time\
  \ I\u2019d been out I\u2019d encountered maybe two other people. I read in tons\
  \ of travel guides how Iceland was becoming a major tourist destination, yet here\
  \ I was, in sweet solitude. Looking back, I remember that as perhaps the most memorable\
  \ part of my trip. It felt almost otherworldly, to be lost on this mist shrouded\
  \ trail. I came to Iceland expecting stunning vistas of volcanoes and glaciers and\
  \ I found them. What I did not expect however, was the ability to get lost, to be\
  \ alone and experience the wildness of this vast, endlessly beautiful country."
