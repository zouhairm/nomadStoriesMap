Text: "When you are struggling in life for survival there are instances when you completely\
  \ lose faith from yourself.When stepping out from home and meeting strangers is\
  \ itself a challenge.\u201DThe Fear\u201D of losing yourself is so intense that\
  \ you choose to be with yourself though with lots of doubts, anxiety and mixed feelings.The\
  \ pain and getting hurt makes you choose to stay away from all.You run, you jog\
  \ ,you listen to loud music,you sleep, you work but each moment makes you feel that\
  \ you need something which will change it forever.It\u2019s only YOU who can change\
  \ it and its YOU who have power to change all negative energy into positive one.\
  \ And you choose to be with yourself.You decide to push yourself and make that trek\
  \ which you have only heard about.You never been before to any such experiments.You\
  \ leave behind all your comfort life, comfortable people and all your weaknesses.You\
  \ want to get rid of that fear. You chose to be ALONE for some time.You make a Himalayan\
  \ trek with all strangers which needs physical strength & mental wellness.You start\
  \ the journey all alone for first time ever. Right from night journey in train to\
  \ taking bus with strangers around, you only choose to stay awake all your nights\
  \ in travel.But some people around catch fear in your eyes and they also chose to\
  \ stay awake whole night to make you feel comfortable & safe.This lessens the count\
  \ by one from your list of fears.When you open window on early morning & again for\
  \ the first time you see snow covered mountains all around.You fall in love,believing\
  \ in love at first sight. When you step out from the bus and see local people who\
  \ are completely strangers but with smile on their face, you know that you are safe.They\
  \ can\u2019t harm you and your feelings.You can also spread love with them.Each\
  \ day you replace your wants with needs.You push your limits to finish your targets\
  \ of reaching to top of mountain.But the journey where you met different non-judgmental\
  \ people who all have same goal of reaching to the top, helping each other and spreading\
  \ love & care you start diminishing all your fears and what all remains is feeling\
  \ where you found happiness in small things and in yourself. You found happiness\
  \ in your own company.When you are standing at the top of mountain it\u2019s only\
  \ a smile to make that right decision in spite of all limits in yourself.You chose\
  \ to stay alone but you are now a solo traveler who found purpose.And I found a\
  \ purpose with travelling, which is to live life in your own company."
