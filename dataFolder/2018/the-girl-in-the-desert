Text: "She couldn't have been more than nine or ten years old, though I\u2019m not\
  \ a great judge of age. \n\nThe village where she was born, surrounded by the harsh,\
  \ dry Lut Desert, was my home for just one night. The ancient irrigating \u2018\
  qanats\u2019 brought water to this tiny town surrounded by an area devoid of life.\
  \ Palm trees jutted from the dry earth --  it was a veritable oasis, something I\
  \ had only seen pictured in story books and movies. We arrived right before a sudden\
  \ rainstorm  -- a rare downpour resulting in dark skies and rainbows against the\
  \ backdrop of an ancient citadel, yet clearing within 30 minutes of starting. There\
  \ was not a lick of mud on the ground; every drop of moisture sucked up by the desert\
  \ sands.\n\nHaving checked in at my tent, and being the only traveler at the village\
  \ that night, I sat at a rickety table when she approached. She didn\u2019t speak\
  \ any English, though neither did her parents or younger brother. That didn\u2019\
  t stop conversation, which  ended with the girl decorating my finger nails in henna.\
  \ Her mother shook her head, while I relished the moment. The little girl very clearly\
  \ wanted to learn English and she had an inquisitive mind. We started with the ABC\u2019\
  s, it didn\u2019t take her long to learn them and perhaps even less time to learn\
  \ to write them. Numbers were a bit harder, once we got to the double digits in\
  \ particular. But she was determined. Periodically, her brother, who was playing\
  \ airplane around the table, would pop up with an answer that she didn\u2019t know,\
  \ surprising us all. \n\nI wondered how many languages she (and by apparent osmosis,\
  \ her brother) had learnt the alphabet in by that point. French, German, Arabic,\
  \ maybe even Hindi? English not so much, considering the closed borders to Americans\
  \ and Brits that had only recently started opening. In fact, during my two weeks\
  \ in Iran, I met only one other American and a small handful of other native English\
  \ speakers. \n\nI couldn\u2019t share a story with her, but she left me with one.\
  \ My favorite stories of travel abroad involve conversations with people whom I\
  \ could not converse, with whom I shared body language, facial expressions, simple\
  \ words and the desire to understand one another. \n\nA month later, at home in\
  \ Portland, Oregon, the henna had almost entirely faded. I had considered covering\
  \ it with fingernail polish but wanted the daily reminder of a life other than my\
  \ own. When I look down at my fingernails even now, three years later, I can still\
  \ see that little girl\u2019s face in my memories."
