Text: "\u2013Todo bien, Francisco? \n\u2013Yes, Don Sinesio. I\u2019m alright\u2026\
  How much longer?\n\u2013Bueno\u2026some four hours \n\u2013Four hours yet?\n\u2013\
  maybe three, if we don\u2019t keep stopping.\nDon Sinesio has been my guide to the\
  \ Laguna de Los C\xF3ndores. A rugged  horseback trek through the cloud-cloaked\
  \ eastern flanks of the northern Peruvian Andes. The first day was a seven hours\
  \ ride through mossy jungle, windswept mountain passes and boggy grassland. After\
  \ sleeping in a shack, the second day was a return trip of hiking, boating across\
  \ the lake, climbing through the pouring jungle to reach the cliff ledge where more\
  \ than two hundred mommies belonging to the Chachapoyas, a mysterious pre-Inca population,\
  \ had been found. Today is the journey back. It\u2019s been as amazing as demanding.\
  \ It\u2019s February, rainy season. I\u2019m soaked to the bones and exhausted.\
  \ I had never been on a horseback for more than two hours before. \nSinesio has\
  \ tried several time to accelerate the walk into a trot, but I\u2019ve always pulled\
  \ the reins fearing the next step. What if El Jefe, my young, short-legged grey\
  \ stallion, goes into a gallop? Riding a horse is facing a paradox. In order to\
  \ control him, you need to loose control over yourself. A big issue for me. While\
  \ we complete a steep descent, I think of how much effort in my life is spent on\
  \ control. Every reaction, emotion or outburst of life is usually suppressed, if\
  \ it threatens everyday balance. So is with El Jefe. So far I cooled down every\
  \ athletic desire of him. But holding down requires effort, and I am out of energy.\
  \ \n\u201CVamos, Francisco!\u201D Sinesio urges me as we get past the third peak.\
  \ Once on a more undulated plateau, I kick my heels into my horse\u2019s belly a\
  \ couple times. He increases the rhythm. Holding the reins with my right arm, I\
  \ open the left one and lift the whip. Before I hit, my butt is pushed up in the\
  \ air. He felt me. I can\u2019t stop you now, Jefe. I rotate the whip once. And\
  \ again. And again. Until my butt leaps become regular and paced. The wind sweeps\
  \ my cheeks now. We are flying on a terrain which was sloppy up to a minute ago.\
  \ A feeling of vastness flows in my chest. It\u2019s like having finally said the\
  \ truth to a person. The cracking of a shell. The feeling of trust instead of fear.\
  \ \n\u201CPucha Francisco! You looked like an Apache on that horse!\u201D exclaims\
  \ Sinesio the next day at the bar, among the laughter of his old fellows. I smile,\
  \ as I swallow my pain killers. Sometimes it takes a long journey \u2013and a lot\
  \ of pain in the butt\u2013 to make a little step forth."
