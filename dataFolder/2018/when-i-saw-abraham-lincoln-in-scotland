Text: "Stumbling through\_Edinburgh, it\u2019s easy to feel lost. Touring the city\
  \ is like\_traveling through time. You could sit in a perfectly modern caf\xE9,\
  \ then step out onto a cobblestone street and gothic towers. Still, despite being\
  \ directionless, I didn't imagine I would wind up seeing Abraham Lincoln in a graveyard.\n\
  I had just made my way down from Calton Hill,\_(a great overlook for all of Edinburgh),\
  \ and was looking for a place to catch my breath. A wrong turn brought me to the\
  \ entrance of the\_Old Calton Burial Ground, a graveyard established back in 1718.\n\
  I knew what it was the moment I saw it. It was hard not to, the small mausoleums\
  \ were visible from the bottom of the stairs. Despite that, I jogged up the old\
  \ steps to get a look. That was when I saw him; immortalized in a Scottish cemetery.\
  \ Reminiscent of the Statue of Liberty, with it\u2019s green tinge and impressive\
  \ stature, he had a welcoming presence among the dead. Not like the statues of cherubs\
  \ and angels I had been exposed to before.\nIt\u2019s the only monument of its kind\
  \ outside of the US. Unveiled in August of 1893, it was presented as a gift from\
  \ America to Scotland to commemorate the\_Scottish-American Soldiers\_who fought\
  \ in the\_Civil War. The very soldiers buried in that graveyard. Requested by Wallace\
  \ Bruce, American Consul and veteran of the Civil War, the bronze sculpture details\
  \ a stoic Lincoln, watching over his soldiers, while a freed man reaches out to\
  \ him. The memorial stands not only to commemorate, but as a symbol of\_unity. It\
  \ shows that anyone can choose to be an American. A dream that many who grew up\
  \ in the States often lose sight of.\nIn a world saturated with smartphones and\
  \ social media, the dissemination of information grows with each day. Everyone has\
  \ seen the Mona Lisa, Mount Rushmore, and Stonehenge, but few have truly experienced\
  \ them. This statue reminded me of that. There is a difference between seeing an\
  \ image, and actually being there. There is a literal depth that can\u2019t be captured.\
  \ A chill in the air, the smell of the grass, the sounds of the city.\nI was lucky\
  \ to walk into that graveyard. It shifted my entire prospective for the rest of\
  \ my time there. There is more to travel than just food and selfies. There is an\
  \ experience that can only be found through a city\u2019s people; then and now."
