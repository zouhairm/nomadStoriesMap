Text: "The first commandment for every good explorer is that an expedition has two\
  \ points: the point of departure and the point of arrival. If your intention is\
  \ to make the second theoretical point coincide with the actual point of arrival,\
  \ don\u2019t think about the means\u200A - \u200Abecause the journey is a virtual\
  \ space that finishes when it finishes, and there are as many means as there are\
  \ different ways of \u2018finishing.\u2019 That is to say, the means are endless.\n\
  - Ernesto Che Guevara\n\n29/Nov/17 | Rishikesh\n\nHave you ever been to Rameswaram?\
  \ asked a baba sitting on Ganga ghats while passing the smoking pipe across the\
  \ group. Yes! it\u2019s been a long time, and it stays one of the firsts from my\
  \ travel journey, I replied. Why do you ask me that by the way? I continued. That\u2019\
  s where I came from, he replied with a smile.\n\nIt was a dusk. After the Ganga\
  \ prayer when I decided to sit on a ghat for some time, a group of babas settled\
  \ down near me. One of them was talking about how does wireless charging work in\
  \ his torch. I was curious about their discussion, so I joined them just before\
  \ a baba lit a smoking pipe for everyone there. I never could get why they left\
  \ their home on a journey either to get enlightened or to escape the worldly things.\
  \ When I started talking to one of them, eventually he explained how far he has\
  \ traveled and yet he is nowhere close to so-called enlightenment. I asked why are\
  \ you still on the journey then? He replied, calmly, where do we go from here now?\n\
  \nAfter traveling relentlessly over 4 years, I was again at a spiritual place but\
  \ not looking for the god. But somewhere in my journey, my traveling started getting\
  \ influenced by spiritual ideas. It revolved around identity, purpose & sometimes\
  \ the chaos. When traveling for such a long time, you end up with the same questions\
  \ you asked before, pause for a while and try to look at what you have unlearned.\
  \ Traveling then wasn\u2019t about finding something, but losing the things which\
  \ never belonged to the journey. It will be a chaos when you would be left with\
  \ very few things you relate to, but it will be a freedom if you manage to contain\
  \ it. When you have left with nothing to rely upon, you have the freedom to choose\
  \ your thoughts, ideas & the identity.\n\nWhether you have started living in the\
  \ moments or have started building up a story, whether it\u2019s a freedom or a\
  \ chaos, doesn\u2019t matter how far or how long you have come, it will ask you\
  \ only one question; when the means are endless, where do we go from here?"
