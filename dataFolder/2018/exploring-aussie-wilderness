Text: "\u201DOho! He just jumped on me!\u201D I am awakened by a sudden noise outside\
  \ of my tent. Possums have started their nightly routines and followed their instincts:\
  \ they want their share of the camping food.\n\nI am at Sealers Cove which is the\
  \ final destination of my three-night-hike in Wilsons Promontory National Park,\
  \ Australia. I feel tired but happy. Long white beaches and rocky landscapes have\
  \ been definitely worth of all the soreness that I feel in my body. So far I have\
  \ hiked over twenty-five kilometers, climbed up and down dozens of hills, felt the\
  \ burning Aussie sun and refreshing shadows of eucalypt trees. Here, you really\
  \ forget the past and future, everything is here and now. With your senses fully\
  \ open, the cool ocean breeze feels more refreshing on your skin, birds sing more\
  \ beautifully, stars on the night sky blink brighter and a bowl of bean-tomato pasta\
  \ with hint of chilli tastes better than ever in city.\n\nThere is no electricity,\
  \ running water nor internet. It's just you, essential camping gears (less is definitely\
  \ more), like-minded hikers and nature. Doesn't really seem a lot, does it? But\
  \ in fact, it's more than you could wish for.\n\nIt's hard to tell whether a relaxing\
  \ swim after a day's hike, reading a favorite book inside a warm sleeping bag or\
  \ a cup of campfire brewed coffee shared with hiking pals would be the very favorite\
  \ moment of your hike. Or perhaps it would be the amazing sunset that colors the\
  \ sky in bright red while you are strolling at a sandy beach.\n\nAs the thoughts\
  \ wander in my mind I notice the surrounding silence. The possums have left and\
  \ I fall into a sweet, much-needed sleep.\n\nNext morning I wake up early, just\
  \ at the right time to witness the sunrise. Soreness of my muscles seems to ease\
  \ out as I stretch my legs and get deeper and deeper into the thick rainforest.\
  \ The paths are well-signed, and after a couple of hours, our three-person-hiking\
  \ crew arrives at the carpark in Telegraph Saddle. We made it!\n\nHowever, the sense\
  \ of victory soon vanishes once we realize the battery of the car has run out. Moreover,\
  \ it seems like there's something wrong with the keys too.\n\nAfter a help of fellow\
  \ campers, call to a road service and a few long hours, we are back on the road.\
  \ I grin a bit, I have just understood that the unexpected did not happen in the\
  \ Australian wilderness but at the carpark when returning back to the civilization."
