Text: "Settling myself in a rustic bus on the way to visit an island giving me goosebumps\
  \ with the speedy drive swerving fast in every curving side. Regardless, my focus\
  \ is about the island I am going to see with no expectation of what it has to offer.\
  \ Its name is even difficult to remember, Pangangan Island, an island that has the\
  \ longest causeway in the Philippines that no one tends to take notice of.\n\nArriving\
  \ at this place, I received a warm greeting from the family where I initially decided\
  \ to stay for 5 days. They are actually my relatives whom I haven\u2019t seen for\
  \ ages. Since I came in late to this peaceful island with a tiring body and a sleepy\
  \ eyes,  I call it a night after a  delicious dinner.\n\nAt 5 AM the next day, rooster\u2019\
  s blasting sound woke me up that quickly gave me an impression that I am indeed\
  \ in a remote area. Everyone in the house is still asleep so, I decided coming out\
  \ of the house. Surprisingly, two friendly locals from across the house approach\
  \ towards my way with a huge smile. They are a couple that seemed to prepare themselves\
  \ for something I could not identify. They asked where I am and what I am doing\
  \ on the island. After a brief conversation, they invited me to join them for a\
  \ walk mentioning they are heading towards the coconut farm. Without a second thought,\
  \ I obliged. \n\nAlong the way, they introduced themselves, they have 7 daughters.\
  \ To survive the family\u2019s daily needs, selling coconut wine is the only source\
  \ of income that compensates them, though not enough but can feed the whole family.\n\
  \nIt took us 20 minutes coming to the plantation. With their kindness, they happily\
  \ introduced the process. From getting the unfermented coconut juice from the green\
  \ pod of the coconut tree up to the last step. It's the husband who climbs the tree,\
  \ work on that unfermented juice and making sure he successfully closed the green\
  \ pod to easily produce another juice for the next day. While the wife prepares\
  \ all the things needed for fermentation of the harvested juice and the grounded\
  \ bark which she gives to the husband before he climbs a tree. As per my count,\
  \ the man climbed 12 trees and working about 7-15 minutes on each. Fermenting the\
  \ juice is kind of different, they utilize the used 5-liter plastic bottle and a\
  \ small piece of netted cloth attached to it so when the juice came flowing in,\
  \ no barks will be included. \n\nA memorable 3 hours connecting with them at the\
  \ plantation, understanding how hard it is to live a life having a small amount\
  \ of income."
