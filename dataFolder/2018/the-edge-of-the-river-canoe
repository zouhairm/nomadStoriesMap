Text: "I jumped out of bed and looked at the time. Great! January 1st and I was late\
  \ for my first appointment. I rushed to catch the bus just in time.\n\u201COk, first\
  \ time rafters on this side.\u201D our instructor screamed with a thick Costa Rican\
  \ accent.\n\u201CI\u2019m not a very good swimmer,\u201D I heard myself say.\nI\
  \ met the people who would be on my river canoe team. My team, partially responsible\
  \ for my life in this Class 2, 3 rapid-laden river.\nThe first 45 minutes were filled\
  \ with shrieks, laughs, and running for cover inside the rafting canoe when our\
  \ guide, Marselo, screams, \u201CGet down! Get down!\u201D\n\nThe river was angry\
  \ that day, my friends.\n\nWe stopped for a snack of fresh watermelon and pineapple,\
  \ then got back on the canoe and rafted the rest of the way. With half an hour left,\
  \ each guide asked for a volunteer from their canoe to be team captain.\n\nI raised\
  \ my hand. I carefully took my position sitting down at the edge of our canoe, ready\
  \ to lead my team in victory.\n\u201COk. Steph, grab the rope at the edge of the\
  \ canoe,\u201D \u2018Selo managed to relay.\nUh oh.\n\u201CUm, what rope?\u201D\n\
  \u201CThe rope! Just grab it.\u201D\nI looked ahead at the rapids and back down\
  \ at my empty, ropeless hands.\n\u201CNo rope up here, \u2018Selo\u201D I screamed\
  \ back, frozen with fear.\n\u201COhh, we got that canoe today!\u201D He said calmly,\
  \ as if everything was right with the world.\n\u201CCome again?!\u201D I begged.\n\
  \nI nervously looked around and yanked the white rope intertwined within the canoe.\n\
  \nI sat on the edge of a canoe, in a country that wasn\u2019t my own, speaking a\
  \ language that was not my native tongue, and laughed as I brought my team to victory\
  \ on the first day of the year. \n\nThe first year out of college, you are thrown\
  \ over the edge: graduate, get a job, get an apartment.\nI was born in a small town\
  \ in Haiti, moved to the US after a decade, and survived the culture shock that\
  \ came with attending high school in Boston. A lot of that felt like getting in\
  \ the canoe, and paddling through the rapids. Slow and steady.\nThen, I swam the\
  \ turbulent waters of college for four years at Tufts. After I graduated, it turns\
  \ out I was just beginning. Be an adult, learn to budget, make good choices, and\
  \ make your immigrant parents proud - that\u2019s the edge. The full blown, ever-shaking\
  \ edge.  \nTransitions are hard - you are placed on the edge just to see what you\u2019\
  re made of - to see if you can find a string in a ropeless situation.\nI was screaming\
  \ on top of my lungs in a small canoe in Costa Rica, I had come along way from Mirebalais,\
  \ Haiti. \n\nPura Vida. Indeed."
