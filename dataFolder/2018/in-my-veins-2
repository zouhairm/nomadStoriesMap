Text: "\"Wonderful\". \nWonderful was the first word i feel walking through the halleys\
  \ of Catania. Sicily has such a great sorry to tell to all of us. Sun is almost\
  \ burning my white skin, birds fly happy to be there in that period of the year.\
  \ It's December. It's not cold. How is that possible? \"Because this is Catania!\"\
  \ is the answer of a local guide. \nSeven letters that sound to me like home. I\
  \ walked carefully, every step i made was full of emotions. \"God created a magic\
  \ city!\" i was keep telling to myself. \nCatania is a particular city that needs\
  \ to be visited. She has both a vulcano, \"Etna\", a very high mount and sea.\n\
  I visited lots of museums, streets full of art, until i came in front of that...that\
  \ square. \"University square\" is called. On every side of the square couples and\
  \ kids there were. They were feeling good like i was. \nThere were two giant buildings\
  \ in front of each other. I took some picture to flowers, buildings, people.\nIn\
  \ that place i was breathing both happiness and greatness. \nThen the local guide\
  \ called me and i started to walk. Bellini's theatre was such an amazing construction...culture\
  \ flash and blood.\nI went also to Bellini's park, eating the most amazing sweet\
  \ food: cannolo! Sicilian food is tasty. It contains colours of that beautiful land\
  \ and it smells like family, love and home sweet home. \nDuring that week i met\
  \ such wonderful people that are my friends now. I felt so confortable and i took\
  \ picture of them with me. \nI visited sea, the clear and charming blue sea. The\
  \ last day i went to mount Etna and it was such an unforgettable experience because\
  \ a lot of snow there was up there! \nI played, i had fun, i was in love of everything.\
  \ Every colours, every person, every typical language, every thing.\nThe afternoon\
  \ i took my \"return flight\" and my heart broked down.\nDay after day i was thinking\
  \ about that trip. I was sure and i am sure that Catania is in my veins. I missed\
  \ all of that city, like sunsets, sea, dessert, funny people, art and culture. I\
  \ made a promise to myself: \"i have to return\". \nA month later my return i was\
  \ watching photographs that i took on Catania and i came across a photo, some photos\
  \ that made me feel nervous, i felt adrenaline guess where? In my veins. I felt\
  \ my heart running faster when i saw a \"University Square\" picture.\nSo i suddenly\
  \ understood that Catania called me and my heart wanted to answer. \nI started university...in\
  \ Catania. \nI study law, i have such a good friends here, i am happly in love with\
  \ her!!"
