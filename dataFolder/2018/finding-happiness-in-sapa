Text: "\"Are you sure you should drink that,\" I asked our 20-year-old guide.\n\"\
  Of course,\" she replied taking another swig from the bottle, \"It's 'happy water',\
  \ you drink it when you're sad until you feel happy. I drink it every day. \"\n\
  The tourists - a couple from Australia, a chef from Belgium, honeymooners from France,\
  \ and my girlfriend and I - shared a look of concern.\nWe were sitting at a wooden\
  \ table in our homestay in Sapa, Vietnam. Having just finished dinner, 'happy water'\
  \ started flowing freely around the table, but it always seemed to end up with our\
  \ young guide. We weren't shocked by the drink's alcohol content (over 50%). The\
  \ moonshine paired well with the food we had, serving both as an aperitif and digestif\
  \ to our meal. We just didn't expect our eight-month-pregnant guide to outdrink\
  \ us all. \nArriving in Sapa that morning we met with our group and guides, a small\
  \ crowd of Vietnamese women, some younger than five, some older than sixty. We were\
  \ set to hike 14km to our homestay where we would spend the night in a local house\
  \ overlooking the rice fields. The hike turned out to be much more difficult than\
  \ we expected. The paths, or better say narrow piles of mud between the rice paddies,\
  \ were wet and slippery. The guides didn't seem to be bothered by it. They were\
  \ running circles around us, helping us stay on our feet, pulling us with their\
  \ tiny arms when we would slip. The little girls laughed while running around us\
  \ barefoot, watching us slide like fawns. 14km never seemed so long, but the promise\
  \ of the view kept us going.\nOur guide told us how she was stolen by her husband.\
  \ He grabbed her from the road and took her to his house. After 3 days she had no\
  \ option but to stay, that was the village law. The more she told us about how unhappy\
  \ she was, the more we understood. She tried to get happy the only way she knew.\
  \ She told us that she learned English from the tourists in order to become a guide.\
  \ The job kept her out of house, giving her some freedom. She believed that's the\
  \ best a young girl can do to avoid the same tragedy.\nThe next morning she didn't\
  \ come to say goodbye. She felt too ashamed. As we were leaving, the children came\
  \ to us for one last hug. My girlfriend knelt, took off her necklace and placed\
  \ it around the little girl's neck. We all followed, taking off our bracelets, necklaces,\
  \ hair ties and giving them to the children. They all said 'Thank you' and we felt\
  \ a little happier before we entered the van that took us back to the city."
