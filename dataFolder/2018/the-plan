Text: "The first trip abroad is always special. A three month long trip, more special.\
  \ Dreams do come true. I was going to Europe! I had gotten into my college\u2019\
  s Exchange Program to France. The news wasn\u2019t sinking in. I was ecstatic. An\
  \ intricate travel plan had to be devised to avoid unwanted surprises, I thought\
  \ to myself. My destiny was smiling at this idea.\nThe day of departure finally\
  \ arrived. I landed at Charles de Gaulle airport after my 9 hour long journey and\
  \ headed for the station to catch my train to Lyon.\nLyon was breath taking. I spent\
  \ the rest of the day exploring the city and striking random conversations with\
  \ strangers. All those French lessons taken in school were finally paying off. The\
  \ day slowly faded into night. The Rhone sparkled under the moonlit sky. Sitting\
  \ at a caf\xE9 in Vieux Lyon listening to the beautiful live music, sipping my Merlot\
  \ and savoring my Gouda I breathed a deep sigh. This was it. My European adventure\
  \ had begun.\nA week breezed away. As planned, I was headed for Amsterdam today.\
  \ Sitting on my early morning train to Bruxelles Midi, the connection to Amsterdam,\
  \ I double checked my documents: Passport, check. The nauseatingly expensive Eurail\
  \ pass, check.\nAt 12 pm I finally reached Amsterdam. I stepped outside the station\
  \ and was enraptured by the vibe of the city. The autumn rain added to the charm.\
  \ To protect my precious documents from the rain, I placed them in a clear bag inside\
  \ my camera pouch and headed for my walking tour. No better way of exploring a city\
  \ than walking around it. Wearing his bright yellow raincoat, our tour guide Mark\
  \ greeted us. We walked around the city as he told us about the coffee shops, the\
  \ infamous RLD and the liberal drug laws. Standing on one of the canals, I took\
  \ my camera out to capture a memory of this unforgettable day in Amsterdam. The\
  \ whole day went by admiring the magnificence of this vivacious city.\nLater, I\
  \ took a train to Den Haag, a 55 min ride from Amsterdam. While my mind was still\
  \ wrapped in the thoughts of Amsterdam, the ticket checker asked for my ticket.\
  \ I smiled at him and opened my camera pouch to take out the clear bag. To my utter\
  \ shock, I couldn\u2019t feel it. I swiftly emptied the contents of the pouch to\
  \ check again. Nothing. I had dropped my passport and the pass on the canal! What\
  \ now? How was I going to reach back to Lyon? I was a student on a shoestring budget\
  \ all alone in a different continent without my passport and my travel pass. This\
  \ was not part of my plan."
