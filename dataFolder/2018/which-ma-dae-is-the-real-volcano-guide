Text: "My partner had been to Bali before and coached me on how to endure the humidity.\
  \ I\u2019m from the American Southwest. We don\u2019t sweat; we evaporate at this\
  \ altitude. I worried about having a meltdown in the jungle by day 3 when the clouds\
  \ refused to lift their lid on the heat. Sideman\u2019s rice terraces were dazzling;\
  \ I was withering. I longed for a coastal breeze at Uluwatu or a downpour like we\
  \ had at Batukaru. Our next stop Mt Batur would surely save me. \n\nArya had been\
  \ driving us all over Bali since picking us up at the airport. He was always a text\
  \ away, no trip too far. \u201CBatur? Are you sure?\u201D he asked. The drizzle\
  \ was turning stormy. He wasn\u2019t his buoyant self. We wanted to visit the volcano,\
  \ maybe climb it, and soak in the hotsprings by Lake Batur. Three nights barely\
  \ seemed long enough. \n\nArya said, \u201CPeople are not so nice in Kintamani.\
  \ Many robbers.\u201D He told us about a couple who paid a guide to take them up\
  \ the volcano, cash discount. He would pick them up at 3am at their hotel. They\
  \ paid him, shook hands, took his card and never saw him again. His name was Ma'de.\
  \  \n\nWe arrived in Kintamani. Plastic bags blew along the street. Rupiahs looked\
  \ scarce for locals. I felt chilled. Arya dropped us off at Batur Inn on the crater's\
  \ rim. \u201CBe careful of Ma'des,\u201D he advised. \"Call me anytime. I'll come.\"\
  \ Our room was in the clouds. When they parted, I gasped. The massive volcano had\
  \ two steam vents. We were so close I thought I smelled sulphur. I read it was still\
  \ active. How active is active? On our walk into town an artist showed us his pictures\
  \ made of crushed lava. He motioned us to follow him behind the temple. We hesitated.\
  \ Was this another Ma'de? Women were present. We decided it was safe enough. At\
  \ an overlook, he pointed at the hardened lava flow and said that\u2019s where his\
  \ village used to be. \nWe walked back to the main road after buying some of his\
  \ pictures. Perhaps we could shorten our stay and call Arya when we got back to\
  \ our room. I\u2019ve had plenty of adventures in the mountains back home, but I\u2019\
  ve never been on a sleeping giant that was just napping. \nSuddenly a young man\
  \ coasted his motorbike to a stop in front of us. Tattooed forearms, spiked hair,\
  \ mirrored shades. \u201CNeed a ride? Batur Inn, right?\u201D he asked. We backed\
  \ away, told him we preferred walking, thanks anyway. He persisted, \u201CMaybe\
  \ to the hotsprings?\u201D We glanced doubtfully at his bike. He said he had a car\
  \ and was also a volcano guide. Cash discount. He handed us his card and said, \u201C\
  I\u2019m Ma'de.\u201D"
