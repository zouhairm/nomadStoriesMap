Text: "When we arrived in Mexico City the first thing we did was nap. The second thing\
  \ was get robbed at gunpoint. Over the next week we fought with consulates and credit\
  \ card companies; experienced altitude sickness and food poisoning and saw the country\
  \ overwhelmed by political unrest. We had set out to explore the museums and art\
  \ scene. We got all this and perhaps more than we bargained for. Reflecting on the\
  \ trip, the last thing I expected was to discover a love for Mexico City, but I\u2019\
  m ready to go back anytime. \n Our hostel was beside the National Palace, in front\
  \ of which you find Mexico\u2019s largest public square. For Christmas they filled\
  \ the square with a skating rink and sledding run, something me and my fellow Canadians\
  \ found endlessly endearing. Behind the Palace you can find excavated foundations\
  \ for an Aztec temple, deliberately torn down during the colonial era but still\
  \ demanding to be seen. The colonial architecture is stunning and seemingly everywhere.\
  \ Down the street, the Opera House, intended to commemorate the centennial of the\
  \ Mexican War of Independence in 1910, but not completed till 1934, is an art deco\
  \ masterpiece. Complete with glam roman pillars and splashes of gold, you leave\
  \ with a vague sense that you might be a millionaire. \nEven as we were amazed by\
  \ the city, its challenges never escaped our minds. Leaving a museum one day we\
  \ noticed businesses closing early, people being locked into the subway and people\
  \ running. We found our inner speed walkers and raced back to the hostel. The government\
  \ had raised the gas prices and anger had been bubbling up throughout the country,\
  \ eventually reaching its core for one strange day before being quashed back down.\
  \ We spent an unsettling night on the hostel roof watching the scene unfold below.\
  \ By morning everything was back to normal and locals told us this happens every\
  \ year, a part of a frustrating reality for many. \n Towards the end of our stay\
  \ we visited Xochimilco, an outer neighbourhood made up of canals that once stretched\
  \ throughout the city. We spent the afternoon in tiny boats floating alongside mariachi\
  \ bands, food vendors, and flower stalls, while families gathered together for a\
  \ lazy sunday on the water. The canals are not exempt from the city\u2019s challenges\
  \ - they are severely polluted and affected by encroaching development. Yet they\
  \ persevere. In a city experiencing poverty and violence, it is inspiring to see\
  \ places keep floating along, determined to enjoy a beautiful life."
