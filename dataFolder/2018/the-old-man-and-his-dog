Text: "I was anxious. My first time beyond the States and my first time on the Tube.\
  \ I remembered from orientation to keep to yourself as part of Tube etiquette; my\
  \ gregarious nature was being challenged.\n\n8 a.m. It was like sardines in a tin:\
  \ I couldn\u2019t help but people watch as we stood shoulder-to-shoulder. As the\
  \ car began to clear, I snatched a seat across an elderly man. The map above his\
  \ head showed six more stops before Westminster station.\n\nHe dressed conservatively--his\
  \ brown coat, tattered, his boots, worn, and his corgi matched in modest aesthetics.\
  \ I was reticent to ask for fear of breaking the cultural norm, but I wanted to\
  \ pet his dog. The corgi\u2019s sweetness won and I commented on his good behavior.\
  \ \n\nAs words poured out, I instantly felt I committed a grave crime against British\
  \ etiquette. Then, a clipped, slightly posh voice said, \u201CThank you. He\u2019\
  s on here daily.\u201D\n\n\u201CCan I pet him?\u201D \n\n\u201CCertainly. Max loves\
  \ people. Where are you from?\u201D \n\nI was taken aback that now he was sparking\
  \ conversation. After official introductions, Fred beckoned me forward, whispering\
  \ London\u2019s best kept secrets: a mom-and-pop kabob shop hidden in the bustling\
  \ city, underrated art at the Tate Modern, and the greatest find of fish and chips.\
  \ I was grateful for his insight.\n\nLater in our candid conversation, I confessed\
  \ my trepidations about being in a foreign place.\n\n\u201CHonestly, I was nervous\
  \ to say anything to you. I was told that it\u2019s proper to keep to yourself on\
  \ here.\u201D \n\n\u201CTrue, but that shouldn\u2019t stop you from meeting people\
  \ or trying new things, darlin\u2019. You\u2019ll learn about different cultures\
  \ here and hopefully meet fascinating people. You may even find yourself gaining\
  \ a new understanding of tolerance and acceptance.\u201D\n\nFred\u2019s wisdom was\
  \ unexpected since I didn\u2019t think we would even talk. It may have sounded clich\xE9\
  , but hearing it from him was special. He had a gentleness paired with a mysterious\
  \ and still lively personality; it was like listening to my grandpa give me advice.\
  \ \n\nWestminster station was the next stop and I knew our time was short.\n\n\u201C\
  Thanks, Fred. You made my first Tube ride one I\u2019ll never forget. You too, Max.\u201D\
  \n\nAs we parted, he told me he could tell I would love London.\n\nI stumbled up\
  \ the stairs of the station and looked up.\n\nBig Ben. Grander than I ever envisioned.\
  \ I snapped the iconic photo and captioned my post \u201CBen there, done that.\u201D\
  \ As I walked away from the cosmopolitan crowd, I bundled my face in my scarf, ready\
  \ to see more of this extraordinary place."
