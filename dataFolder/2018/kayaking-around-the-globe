Text: "I hate getting in the water, but I love being on top of it. I rowed on the\
  \ crew team in highschool and it spawned in me a love of rowing a craft to navigate\
  \ an area. One of my goals when I now travel anywhere is to find any body of water\
  \ and get in a kayak. \n\nTo explore in a kayak is often to go where feet and power\
  \ boat cannot take you. Often, you rely upon a local guide to help you and these\
  \ people are characters who have lived in that location for most, but typically,\
  \ all, of their lives. So not only do you get to see the area from a different perspective,\
  \ you learn about it through the intricate details only an indigenous person would\
  \ know. \n\nIn the Cayman Islands, we gazed up at the milky way it was divulged\
  \ that the government boated out and stole starfish from the sea, and brought them\
  \ back to fill the popular tourist destination, Starfish Point. I encountered the\
  \ very bizarre upside-down jellyfish for the first time as I swam in a popsicle\
  \ blue inlet illuminated by phosphorescence in front of Iggy Pop\u2019s house. \n\
  \nI have kayaked through a rainstorm and watched pitbulls swim in a mountain lake\
  \ in the state of Georgia. A friendship was formed in Fiji as I took a girl out\
  \ kayaking for her first time and we chatted, rowing over coral reefs. I saw Sydney\
  \ from the actual harbour and circled a small island that used to be used in past\
  \ wars, rays dancing beneath me. One of the most thrilling was being lifted out\
  \ of the water from below by prehistoric looking manatees in Florida. In the bayou\
  \ near New Orleans, a jazz musician instructed us on nutria and plants.\n\nAt times,\
  \ it can be perilous, on an early morning solo voyage in Belize to glimpse mammoth\
  \ iguanas and coatis, the water became incredibly choppy on the way back. When I\
  \ finally arrived back on land, my arms were like jelly and I could barely replace\
  \ my vessel on its rack. I wasn\u2019t frightened, but it was challenging. While\
  \ kayak fishing on the Chesapeake Bay of Virginia, I made the foolish mistake of\
  \ casting a line out prior to anchoring. I found myself - and my dog - being pulled\
  \ out of the safety of our cove and towards the expanse of the bay at an alarming\
  \ pace. I cut the line and let go of one of the largest rockfish I\u2019ve seen\
  \ to date. \n\nThe act of kayaking has always led me to a deeper understanding and\
  \ connection of a place and its culture. While sometimes dangerous, it is always\
  \ an adventure and sometimes you might even have a \u201Cbig fish\u201D story."
