Text: "Yu River, manmade, thin, and winding, runs past the entrance of Yu'Er hutong\
  \ before it flows into the nearby Shichahai lake. Recently, this neighborhood in\
  \ Beijing has become a major tourist area. These\_hutongs\u2014traditional alleyways\
  \ in which my father had grown up, had played soccer with other boys, everyone popping\
  \ caps off beer bottles\u2014are now \u201Cheritage sites.\u201D They are filled\
  \ with gift shops; lined with chirping vendors, many of whom are recent migrants\
  \ from rural areas.\nMy second morning here, the man guarding the river mocked my\
  \ mispronunciation of\_Shichahai. I told my relatives.\n\u201CThat\u2019s Xiaoyu!\u201D\
  \ they said. He was the regular stationed at the bridge. He liked to tease Yeye\
  \ on his walks. He often asked to come over for dumplings and wine. My relatives\
  \ laughed. He\u2019s a good kid, they said.\nOne evening, my brother Nathan and\
  \ I went to\_Shichahai, where we stayed until the neon of stores flickered on in\
  \ the woolen smog. On our way back, we ran into Xiaoyu. We asked him where he was\
  \ from. As we expected, he was not from Beijing. He also asked us where we were\
  \ from, though he, too, already knew the answer. China is currently undergoing a\
  \ mammoth internal human migration, and we understood that Xiaoyu, and the changes\
  \ in this historic area, were parts of that. \u201CDo you have any family here?\u201D\
  \ we asked. He shook his head no.\nNathan and I jokingly started saying that Xiaoyu\
  \ was our best friend. Whenever we headed out, we would stop and banter with him.\
  \ Nathan pointed out stars on his uniform, and they started doing soldiers\u2019\
  \ marches together. Whenever Xiaoyu saw us, he would throw up a salute to my brother.\
  \ We learned that Xiaoyu was only twenty-four. Our relatives reminded us: He\u2019\
  s from out west, and now he has to stand outdoors for hours. He\u2019s bound to\
  \ look older than he is. Our relatives reminded us: Many migrants lack proper housing\
  \ or access to education in Beijing.\nThe day we left, Nathan and I asked Xiaoyu\
  \ to take a picture with us. I felt silly because I was wearing pajamas, but also\
  \ because we had developed such a strange and even patronizing affection for Xiaoyu.\
  \ As we waved good-bye to the high-rises, broken only by willow trees here and there,\
  \ weeping by the waterside, I thought about what he had left behind to come to the\
  \ city, and what we were flying back to. In the picture, we stand like guards at\
  \ his sides, and he is not looking at the camera. In the picture, off to the right,\
  \ is the alley where my father played street soccer many years ago."
