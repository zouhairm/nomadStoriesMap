Text: "The dust on the paving,rose as i dropped my backpack outside Bhuj railway station.\"\
  Madam,where can i take you?\"a young thin voice asked.As i gazed towards him,his\
  \ shaggy,unkempt beard and dark grey pathani suit fluttered in the blowing wind.\"\
  The Rann of Kutch,to view the sunset\",i replied.An inalienable secret with myself\
  \ was that,this was going to be an exhilarating sojourn of an unplanned trip.\n\
  \   Our journey began,peering through an arid landscape splashed with shades of\
  \ brown.Seated on the rare seat of the rickshaw,facing in the opposite direction\
  \ with feet in the air,hair escaped the practical bun atop my head.Passing through\
  \ the 'tropic of Cancer',sun was about to set.\"it will turn dark as soon as we\
  \ reach,do you want to go back?\" he enquired.The decision i took,of having an unexpected\
  \ experience,drove me to move ahead.\n   As soon as we reached the entry check-post,the\
  \ sky was painted like an endless canvas,in the sunset hues.Parking the rickshaw\
  \ there,he offered to join me in the walk towards the salt-flats.\"Don't go now,there\
  \ is nothing visible now\",a lady suggested out of all the people returning back.But\
  \ just that it felt like there was some energy pulling me towards it.With only one\
  \ torch that we had,only to add to our recognition,it was a no moon night.Nothing\
  \ but an endless eye-searing blankness in every direction.Twenty thousand square\
  \ miles of perfect flatness.No clouds,no movement,no life.\n       At the end of\
  \ the pathway,there were rocks that we crossed,just to find our feet struggling\
  \ in the marsh.Having no idea of the start of the salt land,we finally reached after\
  \ some scary heart in the mouth moments.After finding a decent place to sit on the\
  \ crusty surface,i dug it to taste the salt.\n       Laying the scarf on the ground\
  \ i lied down to find the night sky like i had never seen before.it was like a conversation\
  \ between me and the shooting stars.It was like vanishing into some vast realm beyond\
  \ the mind,body and soul.A space so heavenly,and so infinite that it seemed to be\
  \ its own universe.\n       Meanwhile,now that i asked his name,Abdul proved to\
  \ be someone with whom i felt safe and fearless.His name din't let me question his\
  \ loyalty.All that with just an effort of having a blind-faith on someone unknown.Hearing\
  \ a few India-Pakistan border stories and desert ghost stories we returned back.Capturing\
  \ the flavor of the place,I wasn't myself anymore,i became like one of the salt\
  \ crystals reflecting back in the universe."
