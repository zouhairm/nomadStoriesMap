Text: "I had been warned about her.  Warned by previous lovers and previous admirers.\
  \ I was told that she was something out of a fantasy but I didn\u2019t think it\
  \ could happen to me.  The last thing I expected was to fall in love but the moment\
  \ I set eyes on her she far exceeded my expectations.  She was a charmer, of course,\
  \ yet it was more than that.  I couldn\u2019t help myself it was love at first sight.\n\
  \nShe was surely a temptress at work, her sparkle and shine, everything about her\
  \ drew me in.  All of my senses were delighted.  I couldn\u2019t take my eyes off\
  \ of her.  She attached herself to my soul and drained my mind until all that remained\
  \ were the thoughts of her.  The sweet sounds that she made, the astonishing vision\
  \ of her beauty, the delectable scent of her sensuality and the seductive way she\
  \ made the hair on my neck stand up whenever I caught a glimpse of her.  She was\
  \ breathtaking, and embodiment of perfection.  \n\nThe first thing she did was grab\
  \ a hold of me and beg me to escape with her.  I couldn\u2019t bear to go inside\
  \ and close a door leaving her sparkling allure just beyond the other side.  So\
  \ I didn\u2019t, I stayed with her.  Besides she was the type you didn\u2019t say\
  \ no to.  When she asked you to escape, you escaped, even if you didn\u2019t know\
  \ how.  And I didn\u2019t know how but it didn\u2019t matter because she taught\
  \ me.  She taught me things I didn\u2019t know I was capable of learning.  She gets\
  \ inside you and breathes you new life.\n\nSo we danced together, we laughed together,\
  \ we drank together.  We danced in a noisy bar amongst a room flooded with other\
  \ lovers. We danced in the streets beneath the moonlight like no one else existed.\
  \  We laughed, we drank and we danced some more.  She gave herself to me completely\
  \ that night and I to her. I continued to explore her from top to bottom in awe\
  \ of her exquisiteness and she slowly stripped me barren\u2014barren of my knowledge\
  \ and understanding of life up until this point.  We made love until all hours of\
  \ the night.\n\nOn our last day together I was completely silent.  I sat sipping\
  \ my wine, flooding my mind with the memories of her every delight, painting her\
  \ image onto my brain in an attempt to leave nothing behind but the art that was\
  \ her.  I was grateful for our time together, grateful that she allowed me into\
  \ her world. \n\nWhen our time was up I mustered up the courage to leave her behind.\
  \  With a single tear streaming down my face, I vowed to come back and see her again\
  \ soon and whispered into the cool March air, Je t\u2019aime, Paris."
