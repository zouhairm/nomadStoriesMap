Text: "Snow hit the hot spring and heavy fog made it impossible to see beyond an arm\u2019\
  s length. The silhouette grew to be a man walking towards me. I waved back to his\
  \ hello, happy at the chance to indulge a stranger.\n\nAfter customary introductions,\
  \ Paul turned out to be from the South. We started talking about aurora. He talked\
  \ charmingly, \u201CI have trekked miles and miles to see northern lights in locations\
  \ both pristine and deadly, and feel exhilarated every time. It is like a girlfriend\
  \ that I have been dating for years. Often she stands me up in freezing cold and\
  \ sometimes she turns up in dancing contours and colors just to maintain my fascination.\u201D\
  \n\nPaul took a dip to reminisce and spoke with passion, \u201CI owned and trained\
  \ 17 Siberian Huskies for the annual mushing competition. I rode a sled for thousand\
  \ miles. The Iditarod Sled-dog Race is when I crossed the most beautiful magnitude\
  \ of whiteness. My feet were chilled to the bone, my palms molded permanently to\
  \ hold the leash and it felt more like a contest to endure cold.\u201D\n\nWith eyes\
  \ wide open and ears wanting more, I said, \u201Creally\u201D.\n\n\u201CIt was beautiful\
  \ and so silent that I could actually hear nature in wind, in friction between snow\
  \ and sled, in panting dogs and even in sunlight seeping through scarce pines. I\
  \ called my favorite dog Gold.\u201D\n\nHow funny it would have sounded \u2013 Gold,\
  \ rush.\n\nWe both laughed and he started telling how he comes here whenever he\
  \ gets a break from working as a pizza delivery guy cum handyman. In another life,\
  \ he was a scientist in a chemical plant. \u201CI know I am old to be running around\
  \ in subzero temperatures delivering pizzas. But believe me, if you ever want to\
  \ be a handyman, this is the place to be.\u201D The spark in my eyes was compelling\
  \ enough and he continued, \u201CWhen my friend needs extra hands, I also go ice\
  \ fishing with him. I keep the first king salmon. I can grill some for you.\u201D\
  \n\nFacing sky and letting the snowflakes fall on my face, I agreed shyly.\n\nWe\
  \ ate. In his living room, I couldn\u2019t take my eyes off the framed airline ticket.\
  \ Paul finally felt it right to end my curiosity with his farewell words, \u201C\
  I bought one way ticket to Fairbanks. I lingered for days to buy a return and it\u2019\
  s been 22 years now. Alaska became my home \u2013 no matter if the sunlight is for\
  \ twenty hours or four.\u201D\n\nReturning, I steadied myself on the gravels. Thick\
  \ mist metamorphosed into a man or did my mind conspire to build this omen. I took\
  \ a plunge in the soothing waters wondering about my one way ticket."
