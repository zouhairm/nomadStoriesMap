Text: "Sitting there, on the top of that ice cold mountain, contemplating the immense\
  \ white all around us and eating my little chocolate bar, my thoughts couldn't help\
  \ to wander to the moment it all began...\n\n\"Sis, sis!\", my brother stormed into\
  \ my bedroom. I couldn't understand what was going on, why would he be so excited\
  \ at 5 in the morning?! \"Come on, let me sleep\", it sounded like an ineloquent\
  \ grunt. I'm not even sure he understood a word I've said, since he jumped onto\
  \ the bed, trying to show me his tablet. \"Just look at it, trust me...\". There\
  \ it was, on the same website we've spent countless hours daydreaming about an adventure...\
  \ A few months before, whilst scrolling down the little company's website, searching\
  \ for some kind of course to take (it wouldn't matter, hiking, mountaineering, rock\
  \ climbing, ice climbing, ...) that could be close enough to home, cheap enough\
  \ for us, that wasn't totally booked and of which the dates lay within one of our\
  \ holiday periods, my brother and I made a pact: if we ever found such a program,\
  \ no matter where or when we were, we'd stop everything to get it. All those months\
  \ later, there he was, at dawn, dragging me out of bed so that we wouldn't miss\
  \ it.\nAfter that moment, everything changed. We started to plan our journey, right\
  \ to the top of Mulhac\xE9n Mountain, the tallest point in all the Iberian Peninsula,\
  \ in the peak of winter. We'd return on the 23rd of February, the day after my birthday,\
  \ from our one week trip. We gathered all the supplies, bought our new mountaineering\
  \ boots, took our crampons and ice axes out of their shiny blue boxes and with our\
  \ camping bags and tent, now perfectly equipped to extreme cold weather, we left\
  \ our home.\n\nThe path was hard, the rarefied air and our completely full rucksacks\
  \ often made it difficult to keep the swift passe climbing up the mountain. Trips\
  \ and falls were often, the snow was tricky, it could be as thick and slippery as\
  \ ice or as soft as white cotton candy. The ice cold dawns made our sleeping bags\
  \ too cozy to leave them... if there wasn't for the discreet smell of the campfire\
  \ and the warmth of that shimmering light and cracking wood sound, I believe most\
  \ of us would have stayed inside the tents. \nOur small group of strangers quickly\
  \ became a little family. We were depending on each other, risking ourselves for\
  \ one-another. \n\nAnd there I was, sitting on the top of that ice cold mountain,\
  \ contemplating the immense white all around us and eating my little chocolate bar..."
