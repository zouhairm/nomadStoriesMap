Text: "Just like those moments in life in which reality unpleasantly embraces us and\
  \ places both of our feet on the ground, I suddenly saw myself standing there, alone,\
  \ in front of 25 16-year-old teenagers whose attentions were entirely aimed at me.\
  \ Every cell in my body was paralysed by fear and doubt. What now? What was I thinking\
  \ when I actually believed that this Giuliane, immersed in anxiety and emotional\
  \ chaos, could deliver self-development sessions in ROMANIA?\n\nTo many people,\
  \ remote, little explored and reduced to few stereotypes, this european country\
  \ remains a great unknown. For 43 days, my senses were bombarded with a great variety\
  \ of unprecedented stimuli. The freezing air on my skin, the indecipherable sound\
  \ of the native language throughout the place, the white and peaceful immensity\
  \ filling my eyes, all of them provoked a scary, but oddly pleasant sensation of\
  \ disorientation. Being completely lost pushed me out of my comfort zone in every\
  \ imaginable way. Discovering every corner of this hidden city I later called home\
  \ - Pitesti - became, then, my daily task.\n\nOn the one hand, the city radiates\
  \ an incomparable peacefulness, exposing a rustic atmosphere with a retro architecture\
  \ and carrying a past worthy of being discovered. On the other hand, crowded pubs\
  \ surrounded busy streets, all combined with the tireless youth, revealed another\
  \ entirely distinguished identity. Day and night, the colorful and  well-lit main\
  \ square placed beside a huge commerce may impress as much as Times Square. However,\
  \ besides providing me this huge amount of new experiences, the multifaceted Pitesti\
  \ gave me more love and affection than I ever imagined I could receive in such little\
  \ time. Warm hugs, kind words, spontaneous gifts, mutual help and tears of pure\
  \ joy became part of my daily routine.\n\nThis routine, the love, the struggle and\
  \ the adventure \u2013 the reality as I described \u2013 embraced me and I hugged\
  \ back. At that very first moment in front of my students, as I heavily breathed\
  \ in and out, deep in my subconscious, the embarrassament, self-distrust and, mainly,\
  \ the fear gave way to a self-confidence and inner strength I didn\u2019t know I\
  \ had. Back then, I realized that courage to confront great barriers, to face challenging\
  \ tasks and to explore the unknown does not translate into the absence of fear.\
  \ In my eyes now, courage is the fascinating ability to intentionally use your own\
  \ anxieties, doubts and angst as foremost triggers to thrive and outgrow your own\
  \ past Self."
