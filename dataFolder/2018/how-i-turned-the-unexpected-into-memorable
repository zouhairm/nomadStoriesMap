Text: "Walk in Sapa and it\u2019s impossible not to notice these tiny women, all wearing\
  \ dark blue coats with fine colourful embroidery and rattan chests on their backs.\
  \ You\u2019ll be noticed too by most of them, they will approach you, trying to\
  \ lead you to their houses. No, this doesn\u2019t have anything to do with sex.\
  \ \nIt\u2019s  a personalised trekking experience into the wild and undeveloped\
  \ north of Vietnam, with a local guide and overnight stay at a local village. All\
  \ is negotiable, but their kindness is simply irresistible, and, in few hours, you\u2019\
  ll pack your bag ready to go, up and down hills, entering tea forests surrounded\
  \ by a thick mist, passing local farmers keeping up with the daily duties and trying\
  \ not to slip on the tricky parts of the track. \nIt\u2019s early March and the\
  \ weather isn\u2019t really on our side. Almost all the depictions of this place\
  \ show bright green stepped fields thriving with rice crops in the distance but,\
  \ right now, it\u2019s pretty much the opposite. The fields are fallow now, so they\
  \ look more like mud pools and visibility isn\u2019t much more of fifteen meters\
  \ so we can\u2019t see much. But this is not the point. \nTao, our guide, but I\
  \ should say host instead, make us feel welcomed and at ease. While trekking she\
  \ talks through local plants and customs and when we reach her house, in Hau Thao\
  \ village, we feel at home. So much so that my boyfriend decides to get sick with\
  \ terrible food poisoning, probably caught in the city, and it takes him out for\
  \ a couple of days.\nLeft along, I take out my pocket cards and start playing solitaire.\
  \  Gian, Tao\u2019s six years old niece, approaches me with a shy smile but her\
  \ curiosity for the shiny cards is too big to resist. In few moves she understands\
  \ the game and we start playing together without needing to talk. After some time,\
  \ she goes and takes out a small tool box. Inside are her thread and needle. She\
  \ teaches me how to embroider. The whole family entertains me, talking and letting\
  \ me help them with the cooking, giving me the opportunity to observe the dynamics\
  \ which are strongly divided by gender. After school boys go to the field with dad\
  \ and girls stay with mum learning how to maintain the house. When Ian finally recovers\
  \ we have a big dinner. After, we all take a turn playing their traditional instruments\
  \ one of which is a sort of back pipe made with bamboo.\nHaving already prolonged\
  \ our stay, we depart the next day. We stop for a tea on our way to sip in the last\
  \ moments in this quietly authentic corner of the world."
