Text: "It was April 2013 and I was 17 years old. I had just sold my little Nokia phone\
  \ to Justine Caruso for $25, my grandfather had just passed, and I was heading to\
  \ his apartment to help my dad clean it out. I sat on the R train rocking back and\
  \ forth to a silent beat underground in Queens, New York.\nAs I get closer to my\
  \ stop I watch as a mother herds her two small sons into my car. They sit next to\
  \ me, and the mother hands them bags of cereal and stares at her phone. Before the\
  \ doors close, an elderly homeless woman wearing a bunch of old coats gets on the\
  \ train, pushing a cart brimming with garbage. She quietly mutters indecipherable\
  \ words, and I turn to the tried and true New York code of conduct: mind your business\
  \ and pray you don\u2019t accidentally make eye contact. \nHowever, innocence and\
  \ curiosity don\u2019t follow these rules, and the older boy of the two was staring\
  \ directly up at the woman. Like a hawk, she locks eyes with him. I immediately\
  \ want throw my arms over the little boy, as if to say, \"He doesn\u2019t know better,\
  \ please spare him!\u201D but I\u2019m petrified. A seemingly innocent moment has\
  \ a whole other meaning in my city. The homeless woman slowly reaches for her pocket,\
  \ and I hold my breath thinking she\u2019ll start a crazed rant. However, she pulls\
  \ out a clean wad of white paper napkins, and hands them to the boy in a gentle\
  \ motherly way. \nI watch in awe as the boy gingerly takes the napkins without hesitation,\
  \ and silently hands some to his younger brother. The two boys wipe their mouths\
  \ of cereal crumbs, the train comes to a stop, and the woman hobbles out the door\
  \ with a little nod. \nI look over at the mother whose lost in her phone. The train\
  \ lurches forward and breaks her trance, she looks down at her sons and asks where\
  \ they got the napkins. The older boy gleefully answers \u201CThe woman!\u201D The\
  \ mother look around at a fairly empty train, \u201CWhat woman?\u201D The little\
  \ boy answers again with more excitement \u201CThe woman! The woman!\u201D his younger\
  \ brother cutely points to an empty spot where she once stood. The mother looks\
  \ at me, and I avert my eyes, I don\u2019t want to break the magic. She sighs, takes\
  \ some of the napkins, and brushes down the little boys\u2019 laps as we continue\
  \ rolling through the underground with my little secret. \nThe world is full of\
  \ exceptions to our biases, and I keep an open mind and heart to them. There is\
  \ some solace in knowing that a kinder gentler world can exist in small moments\
  \ between a little boy and a homeless woman on the R train."
