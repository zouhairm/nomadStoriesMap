Text: "\u2018So you don\u2019t drink at all?\u2019 - asks me one Georgian seeing my\
  \ struggle with the fifth or the sixth glass of strong homemade wine\u2026 Actually\
  \ me and Nicole were going to see the Gelati Monastery near to Kutaisi, the city\
  \ in the middle of Georgia, and ended up at the table with old Georgian men we\u2019\
  d just met.\nIt was late January and I, a literature major senior from St. Petersburg,\
  \ and my American friend Nicole, who was doing the Fulbright in Zaporozhye (don\u2019\
  t ask\u2013it\u2019s another story), were very enthusiastic to realize our old dream\u2013\
  travelling to Georgia.\nKutaisi was our third city and we\u2019d already taken as\
  \ a rule that the first step to set the communication with locals should be the\
  \ phrase \u201CHello! I\u2019m from Leningrad!\u201D I was late a bit to be born\
  \ at the USSR time, but, anyway, every Soviet person who we passed by was absolutely\
  \ charmed hearing the name of a dream-destination. So if Nicole and I\u2019d been\
  \ mercenary enough we would had definitely desired something more than to make the\
  \ driver of the last marshrutka to the Gelati wait the ten minutes to drive us back\
  \ to Kutaisi after a quick look to the church.\nBeing amazed by winter wonderland\
  \ and the monastery, we went back to the car and figured out the driver was not\
  \ ready to go anywhere. Cautiously I tried to say the \u201Cmagic\u201D words again,\
  \ but the man interrupted me and said that he and his friends would had been happy\
  \ to invite the guests from Leningrad to their house\u2026That is how me and Nicole\
  \ turned out to be in the company of four old Georgian men. They\u2019d given us\
  \ the delicious wine served with homemade bread, fresh and giant grape, salted delicacy\
  \ and prolific and loving stories about their life, families, country, so we\u2019\
  d been drinking and talking as long as the wine poured\u2026\n\u2018Please, drink\
  \ slower\u2019, \u2013Nicole said to me, lowering her voice. She knows I\u2019m\
  \ making a friendship, falling in love and getting drunk equally fast; thus, I tried\
  \ just to invisibly touch the wine at the glass by my tongue not to lose an ability\
  \ for hearing. Nevertheless, all I\u2019ve remembered are the separately caught\
  \ phrases about youth, friendship, respect to the world.\nPerhaps I\u2019d failed\
  \ with my task; however, whether it was the wine\u2019s fault or not, I\u2019d found\
  \ how perfect were the ways we and the locals set our communication.\nGoing back\
  \ home, I\u2019d read at the eyes of my American friend the same words as I\u2019\
  d been thinking: there\u2019s no distance, difference and misunderstanding if your\
  \ eyes are open and you love the world genuinely and greedily."
