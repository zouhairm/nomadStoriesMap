Text: "The guy started to play with fire sticks, juggling them slowly then really\
  \ fast, throwing them high in the air and catching them behind his back. While playing\
  \ with fire he was talking about the places that he lived in, the interesting people\
  \ he met and funny things that happened to him. You had to like him. At the end,\
  \ people hurried to put the money in his hat. My curiosity buzzed me. I wanted to\
  \ hear more, I wanted to see more. I wanted to find out what's behind that compelling\
  \ show. \n I moved away from the crowd and went to get a milkshake. Fifteen minutes\
  \ later, returning to the place where I left the object of my curiosity, I saw the\
  \ guy sitting on the small wall with his one wheel bike horizontally placed in front\
  \ of him. He looked tired. I started circling around, holding a big milkshake cup\
  \ with both hands and chewing the straw, looking a little at the sky, a little at\
  \ the floor, and from time to time at him, observing what he was doing.  He soon\
  \ noticed me, and probably thought, \"what a weird girl\". I realized there was\
  \ no point in stalking him in such an obvious way any more. I should either leave\
  \ or approach. I took a brief step towards him and made the eye contact. I sat on\
  \ the wall next to him. \nHis name was Blue and he was twenty two. Together with\
  \ his three friends he would often come to Mallory Square to watch people do things\
  \ you are likely to see in circus. They decided they would do the same when they\
  \ grow up, so they started practicing after school, every day, many hours, until\
  \ they felt ready. They didn't go to college, because, he said, they can make more\
  \ money by doing this than by doing most of \"college\" jobs. He also told me he\
  \ made up everything he said during the performance.\nHe'd say to me, \"See that\
  \ man? I've known him since forever. He's been always selling popcorn.\" or \"See\
  \ the place over there. That's where kids like to play.\" At the end he just said,\
  \ \"You need to scratch beneath the surface.\" My view was completely changed, shaped\
  \ in some beautiful, new way. In this place where everyone is trying to escape their\
  \ daily life, I found someone who actually lives it. Blue showed me the real Key\
  \ West, which was more beautiful, more interesting, more human. When vendors already\
  \ started to pack, and people left, heading back to the town, we too, said good\
  \ bye to each other. It was simple, without too many words, as if we were friends\
  \ that will see each other again tomorrow, when the new day brings new stories to\
  \ tell."
