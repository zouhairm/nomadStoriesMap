Text: "With the horns blasting loudly from above, I stood alone looking back at Miami\
  \ as the ship left port finally able to smile after weeks of crying.  No one had\
  \ died per se but the life and career I knew was over, my VP of everything job eliminated\
  \ and I was cycling through the stages of grief.  After being on the hamster wheel\
  \ for more than twenty years with a predictable schedule of work, gym, eat, rinse,\
  \ repeat, I wondered how much of \u201Cme\u201D had been suppressed by this routine,\
  \ what parts of my life had I missed or made concessions over? I was pushed off\
  \ the hamster wheel and out of the cage.  Now what?  I didn\u2019t have a plan (or\
  \ three backup plans) for this situation and now, on a transatlantic voyage, I was,\
  \ in essence, running away from my life.    \n\nI would begin my adventures in Barcelona\
  \ feeding my feelings with tapas and cava before moving on to Italy where my two\
  \ a day gelato habit was born. While the beginning and end of my trip was sorted,\
  \ it was the month of June where my calendar was empty and I was free to attempt\
  \ something new - spontaneity.  It was a freedom to explore without worry, a time\
  \ to say \u201Cyes\u201D without overthinking and seeing where my path would lead.\
  \ That is, until my British friend said \u201Cmeet me in Malta\u201D.   \n\nIt was,\
  \ in Malta, on the tiny island of Gozo that I encountered the last thing I expected\
  \ to find or experience on this solo adventure, I fell in love and also ended up\
  \ in the ER.  I fell in love with island life, in love with my daily ice cream breaks\
  \ by the pool, in love with being free from a schedule and social media and in love\
  \ with what could be (and possibly in love with my British friend but that\u2019\
  s another story). I wasn\u2019t sad or angry anymore, I was hopeful, although now\
  \ had a fractured foot from falling down the stairs in a dodgy rental as a souvenir\
  \ and reminder of my time away. \n\nMy decision to run away (my resume lists it\
  \ as a travel sabbatical) was the best thing I could do for me to the chagrin of\
  \ my family and friends who didn\u2019t understand my need, my aching need, to restore\
  \ my mind, body and spirit through travel.  It was my grief and sadness that sent\
  \ me away, my curiosity and openness that healed me and it was the love with what\
  \ could be that drives me to continue dreaming (and traveling)."
