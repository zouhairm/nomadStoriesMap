Text: "I was traveling by bicycle again, heading into the Colombian department of\
  \ La Guajira, home of the indigenous Wayuu. Having begun in Medellin almost 3 weeks\
  \ earlier, this was my 5th multi-day bike tour in Colombia, and I was already feeling\
  \ weary. Most of my ride along the coast was flat and straight, with no shade and\
  \ very little scenery compared to more mountains regions where I had toured before.\n\
  \nI debated internally whether I wanted to continue. Everywhere I stopped, people\
  \ warned me of the dangers ahead. Trucks passed uncomfortably close on the gravel\
  \ road, and the strong headwind showed no sign of ceasing. I was in Wayuu territory,\
  \ where women are just another commodity that can be bought using a currency of\
  \ goats. Furthermore, water and food were scarce. Wherever there were people, there\
  \ were children with sad faces asking for water or candy. It was uncomfortable to\
  \ witness such poverty. I felt out of place and had constant thoughts of going home,\
  \ but something kept me going, even after having to dodge stones that were thrown\
  \ at me from behind the cacti.\n\nThe road to Cabo de la Vela resembles a dry river\
  \ delta of yellow sand, splitting and converging all over the place to avoid puddles\
  \ that form when it rains. Cabo de la Vela consists of a restaurant- and hostel-lined\
  \ dirt road stretching along the beach on the edge of the desert. There is no running\
  \ water and no electricity. A truck arrives daily to sell water, and the town relies\
  \ on solar power for light. Dishes (and hands) are washed in a basin of soapy water,\
  \ rinsed in another basin of clean-ish water. There are flies everywhere, and it\u2019\
  s not surprising that so many people get sick when visiting. The only local foods\
  \ are goat and fish. Everything else is trucked in, and with no refrigeration, perishable\
  \ food must be consumed the same day. The cell phone tower is frequently out of\
  \ service.\n\nHouses, constructed from dried cactus called yotojoro, certainly don't\
  \ look like they can withstand the wind. Sunlight filters in through the cracks\
  \ in the walls and roof. There are no floors - only sand, and there is no point\
  \ in wearing shoes. Most Wayuu have wide, calloused feet, from years of walking\
  \ barefoot. Instead of beds, people sleep in chinchorros, hand-woven hammocks that\
  \ take Wayuu women 3 to 4 months to make. \nMy plan was to spend a few days kitesurfing\
  \ in Cabo before moving on. The last thing I expected was to still be here a month\
  \ later, working at a kitesurfing school and not wanting to leave."
