Text: "Girl from Mars likes to run. Especially by the new roads and cities, there\
  \ are more questions than answers she will find the last where she runs, as if they\
  \ are dropped with a cry of tired seagulls, flying to the embankment. There, where\
  \ the pink merges with the gray-blue colors of the sky and the big eye of the Atlantic,\
  \ only a white thread of an airplane cuts all this bright layered pie of the pre-production\
  \ action...\nAnd on the run, she met a seagull, slowly pacing the side.\nAnd even\
  \ stopped without pressing pause in the fitness tracker, it surprised her so much\
  \ that the seagull didn't care about it. She proudly stretched out her leg and seemed\
  \ to think to herself: \"Oh, one more human, it's strange that I'm not flying away,\
  \ maybe I just don't want to!\" And the girl asked herself questions. About what\
  \ she really is afraid of, having in her purse as much as 10\u20AC. No, she was\
  \ not afraid to stay without money, and even without a place where to sleep. More\
  \ than anything in the world, the girl was afraid to become a nobody but she didn't\
  \ knew that only by becoming a nobody, she would find herself...\nIn 6 weeks she\
  \ will walk on foot Camino de Santiago. From Portugal to Spain. Alone in the winter.\
  \ Without money. Only a backpack and everyday rain would be the best friends of\
  \ those days and nights.\nStand on the very toes, crouched all over, holding one\
  \ silver spoon by one hand. The water there were uneven, but warm. It is necessary\
  \ to wait a little longer, until it becomes a bit warm, to quickly dive under the\
  \ drops of water and keep warm. Soap and wash very quickly. Until it gets cold again.\
  \ It's already so familiar for 6 weeks. And, by the way, happiness, that there is\
  \ a shower at all. And warm water. In albergue (hostel) for pilgrims, where she\
  \ asked to sleep one old woman. Usually they wanted 6-12\u20AC for it. But this\
  \ way taught her to talk with any person even without knowing language. And the\
  \ main joy of the evening - a roof over the head at night.\nStanding under that\
  \ shower, washing off the day, she felt the tension on shoulders from a heavy backpack.\
  \ And she thought that he knows how to smell the rain... The Portuguese guy from\
  \ Porto, who showed her the secret parts of the city of wine.\n\"I will be happy\
  \ anyway, - decided girl from Mars. - Instincts do not lie. The son of a fisherman\
  \ even can sniff the rain. And can balance me like a wave... Will he be brave to\
  \ go our Camino in Mexico?\". And he abandoned everything to go with her to another\
  \ continent."
