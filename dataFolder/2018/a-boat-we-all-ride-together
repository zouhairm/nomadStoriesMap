Text: "The mother of a 3-year-old girl handed me her child over the side of a crowded\
  \ rubber dinghy on the beach of Lesvos, Greece. The girl\u2019s tiny body was cold,\
  \ and she was wrapped in a black trash bag up to her neck to keep her dry. She had\
  \ a blank look of shock on her face.\n\n\LIt was Fall of 2015, at the height of\
  \ the migration of millions away from Syria and other war zones.\n\nA few short\
  \ months earlier, I fled my comfort zone in America for a four month backpacking\
  \ tour of Europe. Intending to revel and debauch my way across the old continent,\
  \ all I wanted to do was set my trajectory as far from the daily grind (and as far\
  \ from a recent, painful breakup) as I could possibly get.\n\nAlong the way, I saw\
  \ the sheer number of refugees in train and bus stations. It became increasingly\
  \ clear that I had somehow drank and danced my way into a pivotal time and place\
  \ in history. I saw faces of desperation and weariness. Eventually I couldn\u2019\
  t fight the feeling. I had to find a way to help.\n\nThat\u2019s how I found myself\
  \ patrolling the beaches of Lesvos in the cold, pre-dawn hours, ever vigilant of\
  \ dots on the horizon that might grow into the shape of a small, inflatable piece\
  \ of rubber carrying 50-60 refugees toward the hope of building a life somewhere\
  \ safe.\n\nThe sun came up slowly, and volunteers did their best to warm up the\
  \ little girl in the trash bag with silver foil emergency blankets. We waited together\
  \ for the UN to bring a bus to take the new arrivals to dirty, overcrowded registration\
  \ camps.\n\nI suddenly remembered that I had something special in my pocket: a small\
  \ bottle of bubbles. I knelt down by my trash bag girl, smiled, and blew bubbles\
  \ that floated in a swirl of Aegean wind.\n\nShe lit up.\n\nWe played with the bubbles\
  \ together until the bus came, laughing and making silly faces at each other. Her\
  \ smile beamed, and the morning felt a little less cold and dark.\n\nMaybe I was\
  \ repressing some emotions to be able to handle the hundreds, sometimes thousands,\
  \ of refugees landing on the beach every day, but after the bus came and took her\
  \ and her family away, the tears finally broke through.\n\nI\u2019ll never see her\
  \ again, but I often think about her sweet, innocent smile, and the simple act of\
  \ playing with bubbles.\n\nA flash came through my mind of how much had changed\
  \ within me, how I could never have known where my trip would take me. I wiped the\
  \ tears away and headed north down the beach. Another boat was coming.\n\nAnd humanity\u2014\
  \ well, that\u2019s a boat we all ride together."
