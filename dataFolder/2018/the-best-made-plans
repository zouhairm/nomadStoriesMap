Text: "Leaving behind the rocky conglomerate pinnacles of Meteora, each topped with\
  \ a Greek monastery, it was hard to contain my excitement about my month ahead.\
  \ As I made my way up Greece, I remembered the weeks spent in d\xF6ner kebab shops\
  \ studying maps of Anatolia, the Turkish language and culture. Now, within my grasp\
  \ was that great city straddling two continents \u2013 Byzantium, Constantinople,\
  \ Istanbul, so many names evocative of its rich past.\nIt was 4 am when my bus exited\
  \ Greece and pulled up at the Turkish border post. It was my turn to get my passport\
  \ stamped so I handed it over to the officer. Rummaging through its pages, he looked\
  \ up, shook his head, pointed back towards Greece and said \u201CConsulate, visa,\
  \ no problem\u201D. It slowly dawned on me that what must have been my best-planned\
  \ itinerary was on the brink of collapse. In no time, my bag was offloaded. I watched,\
  \ crestfallen as my bus drove away to the country I was to thoroughly explore.\n\
  The Turkish border police, not understanding the visa procedure of their own country,\
  \ deposited me in the hands of their Greek counterparts. I was stuck in Greece \u2013\
  \ it felt odd saying that as millions of people would do anything to be able to\
  \ go there. I was determined to turn disaster into opportunity and not let this\
  \ hiccup ruin my trip.\nWhen buses refused to stop for me, I paid a couple of Syrian\
  \ Kurds who reluctantly drove me to Thessaloniki. With my luck, it was Easter weekend,\
  \ sacred to the Greek Orthodox Christians, which meant the Turkish consulate was\
  \ closed. So, I decided to explore Ano Poli, the quaint upper town by first climbing\
  \ a tree to pluck a succulent orange. From the medieval walls, I walked to the seafront\
  \ and visited the Archaeological and Byzantine museums to discover the city's history.\n\
  By now, my hotel receptionist had grown accustomed to my presence and learning about\
  \ my predicament, took potshots at his Turkish neighbours. The waiter at the neighbourhood\
  \ pastry shop became a friend and we spent delightful evenings chatting over creamy\
  \ French-inspired p\xE2tisserie. Thessaloniki was growing on me but it was time\
  \ to leave.\nOn Tuesday, the Turkish consulate opened but kept me on tenterhooks\
  \ for hours before announcing that I could not go to their country. This experience\
  \ taught me that even the best of plans could fail. So embracing spontaneity, I\
  \ reworked my plans and was soon hiking through Crete's longest gorge and northern\
  \ Italy's jagged peaks before savouring the surprises of Slovenia, a real gem."
