Text: "While working in the Solomon Islands I lived in a small compound made up of\
  \ a ranch style home inhabited by my Australian landlord and four houses each stacked\
  \ on large pillars that gave way to an unobstructed view of the Pacific Ocean.\n\
  \nNormally I made it to bed, but this evening I fell asleep in the living room.\
  \  In the middle of the night, I woke to banging on the door and the colloquial\
  \ shrill of my landlord saying a baby was being born underneath the mango tree on\
  \ the compound.  While I heard his urgings, I was slow to move because of the heaviness\
  \ of sleep and the knowledge that no one in our compound was pregnant.  I even briefly\
  \ thought my landlords\u2019 neglect of his recurring malaria -he\u2019s had it\
  \ 19 times- was evidencing, until I heard the shrieking cry of a mother in labor.\
  \  \n\nGrabbing shoes, I ran down to find my landlord\u2019s girlfriends\u2019 cousin\
  \ giving birth under the protection of bushy mango tree leaves.  The baby had crowned,\
  \ and I was in a race to recall my limited tv-based child birthing experience. \
  \ Using sitcoms as reference, I asked for warm water, scissors, towels, and rubbing\
  \ alcohol, not consciously knowing what they each were for, but ultimately realizing\
  \ they were all needed.\n\nMy only goals were to try and stay calm and to not break\
  \ the baby- no pressure!  As we encouraged mom to push, mom\u2019s cousin held the\
  \ burgeoning baby while I sterilized scissors and cut the umbilical cord.  Terrified\
  \ of cutting wrong and wanting to cry, cousin and mom's had prior births made them\
  \ skilled mentors under fire.\n\nBundled in my car, we arrived at the only hospital\
  \ on the island at nearly 4 in the morning to find it overrun with infirmed lining\
  \ the entrance, straddled like wilted flowers lacking protection from the Pacific\
  \ sun.  While unlike my character, after nearly 30 minutes of inactivity, confusion,\
  \ worry and frustration, I demanded that the only doctor on duty leave his patient\
  \ to attend to mom and baby.\n\nKnowing they were stable, as I made to leave mom\
  \ called me back to thank me and to tell me that she named her daughter Natasha\
  \ - after me.  Immediately, I was touched that there would be a Solomon Islander\
  \ namesake.  Secondly, I was amused at the idea of a namesake because in Solomon\
  \ Island pijin (the local language) there is no letter \u2018H\u2019.  Hence, at\
  \ least in the Solomon Islands, Natasha will forever be Natasa because the \u2018\
  H\u2019 is silent."
