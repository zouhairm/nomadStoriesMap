Text: "My summer studying in Japan opened my eyes to a myriad of wonders. Some, I\
  \ expected like Shinto shrines, bonsai trees, drunk businessmen and geishas. Others,\
  \ like beautiful orange, white and black-spotted koi (what we have in garden ponds)\
  \ swimming under sewer grates and the 60-year old naked female body, I didn\u2019\
  t anticipate.\nAs part of my language immersion class, one weekend we were whisked\
  \ away from the Tokyo suburbs to Nagano, home of fog-covered mountains and the famous\
  \ Japanese onsens.\nI had made a good friend who was in the same language program,\
  \ Michelle. She was a more experienced international traveler, but her Japanese\
  \ wasn\u2019t as strong as mine, so we were a good yin and yang pair, complementing\
  \ the other\u2019s naivety.  \nOne afternoon, we went to a beautiful onsen, a peaceful\
  \ hot springs spa with elegant rice paper walls and the sound of gentle water flowing.\
  \ Michelle and I brought along our bathing suits, so we were well prepared to take\
  \ a dip in the healing and calming waters of the hot springs.  \nWe were taken back\
  \ to the women\u2019s locker room and directed toward the towels, bathrobe and slippers,\
  \ and shower (very important before entering the hot springs), but under no circumstance\
  \ was clothing was allowed in the onsen as it was seen to dirty the water.  \nNews\
  \ to us, Michelle spun around on one heel and promptly said she wouldn\u2019t do\
  \ it. I danced on both feet, not sure what to do. This was a true Japanese experience,\
  \ was I going to let my modesty get in the way of enjoying a cultural tradition?\n\
  Before I lost my nerve, I quickly got undressed, showered and robed and headed outside\
  \ where steam was drifting up from the water.\nThe only people in the onsen were\
  \ several 60- to70-year old Japanese women. They eyed me knowingly, but kindly as\
  \ I dipped my toes in, walked down the first step and said \u201Ctotemo atsui desu\
  \ nee.\u201D (It\u2019s really hot.) They nodded in agreement and nudged me forward\
  \ with their sweet smiles. I took off the robe and sat down, gritting my teeth to\
  \ bear the heat of the volcanic-heated waters.  \nSeveral questions ensued in Japanese.\
  \ Once I satisfied their queries, they got back to their group, so I sat and enjoyed\
  \ their chatter as I closed my eyes amidst the damp, steamy air.\nWhen my skin started\
  \ resembling the shade of an Indiana tomato, I bid them \u201Csayonara\u201D, hopped\
  \ out, put my towel on and went back for another shower before getting dressed.\n\
  And so, I am forever grateful to those Japanese women for helping me free my mind\
  \ and break from my norm."
