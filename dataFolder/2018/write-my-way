Text: "In 2014 A decision that pushed me to the edge besides my first 70 ft. cliff\
  \ jump would have to be accepting a job far from home. I was selected from Connecticut\
  \ and joined a team in Seattle WA to open a first of its kind coffee Roastery and\
  \ tasting room. Here I really learned what life is about. There is such an amazing\
  \ lifestyle and vibrancy in the PNW it is everything they say it is. It\u2019s immaculate\
  \ and unlike any place I have ever been. I did my share of traveling through the\
  \ states and Washington state especially is exciting. Looking out at Mount Rainier\
  \ from Seattle every clear day is a monumentous moment everytime. Making local connections\
  \ here in the city over industries we loved and desired is what bonds us most. The\
  \ coffee, farms, food, the recreational activities, & the lush outdoors always ready\
  \ for an adventure are all local here and supported and taken care of in the proper\
  \ manner. There is a high level of human connection and everyone feels at home here\
  \ which instantly makes you a local even if you just relocated for work like myself.\
  \ I instantly felt at home here. I was able to live out every part of Life and work\
  \ in which I could not on the East coast, New England to be exact. There is magic\
  \ here in the PNW. The way the wild speaks to you alive rainforests, the way the\
  \ city holds you, the way the rain washes it all away. You know your not a local\
  \ here when you have an umbrella, so the saying goes. A story, in Key West a local\
  \ told me you\u2019re closer to Cuba than you\u2019re Walmart and I fell in love\
  \ with Keys. I worked in La Jolla, Dr. Suess was a local and you can see it in the\
  \ landscape. The last thing I expected was to move back home to Connecticut to take\
  \ care of my ailing Mother. I was leaving work one rainy night someone cut me off\
  \ on the highway and I hydroplaned into oncoming highway traffic. After many cars\
  \ hit mine I got out of the car and was struck with a pain so unreal I really don\u2019\
  t have words. I had a stage four spleen rupture more like explosion and held on\
  \ for dear life and with the help of my loved ones and God I am in recovery and\
  \ couldn\u2019t be more blessed. I have since returned to Seattle to work and live\
  \ work and be close to the heavenly hikes and cool hipster hideouts. So much healing\
  \ happens in the PNW. I mean it when I say it\u2019s magic. There\u2019s an energy\
  \ here you can not replicate. The last thing I expected was to live after a bad\
  \ accident. The last thing is expected today was to be writing you this story. Thanks\
  \ for reading."
