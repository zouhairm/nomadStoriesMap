Text: "Today, for the very first time in my life, someone asked me, \u201CWhere are\
  \ you from?\u201D\u2014and I had the delightful pleasure of responding rather simply,\
  \ \u201CHere.\u201D\n\nWe all ask and get asked this question everywhere we travel\
  \ and, while it\u2019s always a warm opening, nothing compares to the feeling of\
  \ telling strangers you are \u201Chome\u201D despite that you are quite obviously\
  \ a tourist. \n\nI am in Landsberg am Lech, a small town in Bavaria that most people\
  \ have never had the pleasure of visiting. There is no beach. No glistening sand.\
  \ No majestic mountaintops. Yet, this small town with a population of less than\
  \ 30,000 people and absolutely ZERO souvenirs (which, also for the first time in\
  \ my life, I actively seek) has been at the top of my bucket list for as long as\
  \ I can remember. \n\nI have no recollection of this place, but it was my first\
  \ home. I was born in an American military hospital 40 kilometers away and lived\
  \ in Landsberg for two years before my parents moved to the United States. After\
  \ that, I grew up in the States\u2014I attended university and law school there,\
  \ began a career as an attorney, and I never looked back until I quit my job and\
  \ booked a flight to Germany so I could explore the small town to which I owe my\
  \ existence. \n\nHere, time is slow and people are genuine. Rainbow-painted buildings\
  \ color the street on the edge of fast-moving fresh water of the bordering river.\
  \ It\u2019s like Venice, only smaller, sweeter, and more serene. There are no crowds\
  \ or lines for over-advertised attractions\u2014just life in a pristine town of\
  \ small local businesses and families. \n\nI always dreamed of returning to discover\
  \ this town where I first lived and of which I have no memories, and finally, I\
  \ am here. In my travels, I have made countless local connections, but none of them\
  \ come close to my first visit home. I keep pinching myself in case this is all\
  \ a dream, but sure enough, coming home is as real as it gets."
