Text: 'To be honest.. im a nomad in my heart..


  But born to indian parents, i didnt really get i chance to go out there explore
  and find myself..


  You see, indian parents are very protective and like to keep their loved ones in
  close proximity.. i was that person who listened to them carefully.. did what they
  asked me to.. but now, maybe a little late in my youththough (i am 28), i have finally
  come to the conclusion that this is my life, and i am going to do what my soul wants
  me too.. i want to be free. I want to live each and every moment passing through
  my soul and making me more than who i was the moment before .. i want to explore
  not only different places but even the capabilities of my own spirit..

  Push the boundaries of knowing, and the boundaries of all that i am capable of conquering.

  I want to take myself to the limit with every new day.. and surpass it making me
  more than i was the day before..

  I want to see learn, explore and experience something new in everyday which would
  constantly change what i believe in..


  There are many ways of finding your truest path.. but the one most inate from of
  realisation, or finding your self is to be lost..

  And this for me is a true opportunity..

  I haven''t travelled much in my youth and that is one thing i regret.. but thankfully
  im not dead yet.. and i am still young in my soul.. still passionate about learning,
  exploring and most importantly experiencing..

  So now i let go off all my shackles and surrender them to my past.. as the hunger
  in my soul i must fulfill..


  Regards,

  Sidharth'
