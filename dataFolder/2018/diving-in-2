Text: "The suspension bridge sways under my bare feet while I tighten my grip on the\
  \ rope handrail. Next to me, the twins lean out on the abyss, challenging the meters\
  \ of emptiness that separate us from the green, swirling waters of the Turia.\n\u201C\
  In 1957 the water came to cover this bridge\u201D, explains Julio. He tramples the\
  \ creaking planks, pointing to the high water line with his wrinkled hand. In the\
  \ narrow canyon, his voice bounces against the rocks, acquiring a metallic shade.\n\
  \"No damage up here,\" says the old farmer, \"but down on the coast, Valencia was\
  \ almost destroyed\u201D.\nThe twins nod: they grew up in the city, they know the\
  \ story. I learned it yesterday, walking through the snake-shaped park that used\
  \ to be the Turia's bed. There is something epic about a community that, to protect\
  \ itself from the nature\u2019s vagaries, decides to move the entire course of a\
  \ river. The same community that meets beneath the white arches of the City of Arts,\
  \ to attend an amateur performance of Benavente's \"Malquerida\".\nThat\u2019s how\
  \ I met Julio, his actress daughter Asunci\xF2n and her sons, the twins Guille and\
  \ Paco. For them, finding out I'm a hiker and inviting me to their Easter trip was\
  \ a matter of seconds.\nThe kids snatch me from my thoughts, dragging me down: I\
  \ find myself rushing towards the water that, after a fall that feels endless, is\
  \ as freezing as one would expect. I float numbed by the cold, staring at the slice\
  \ of sky between the rocks. Two vultures glide toward the hill overlooking Chulilla,\
  \ with the castle ruins barely visible on the top, like a broken crown.\nAfter the\
  \ dive, the packed lunch is even more delicious. Julio proudly explains that pumpkins,\
  \ almonds and oranges come from his garden, while the jam\xF2n serrano that accompanies\
  \ thick slices of tortilla is from Teru\xE9l. We eat under the strong spring sun,\
  \ a taste of the torrid Spanish summer. Around us, the Mediterranean scrub is ready\
  \ to endure the heat: mastic, sage, myrtle, everything has a vibrant color, an intense\
  \ scent. Deer footprints dot the wet ground, but today they will not be seen. Too\
  \ many day trippers have chosen the holiday to visit the Senda de los Pantaneros\
  \ and discover the source of the Turia.\nThe return to Chulilla is melancholic:\
  \ the village of white houses, leaning against the side of the mountain, immersed\
  \ in the silence of the evening, looks like a pueblo fantasma, a ghost town. Easter\
  \ Sunday is over, and everyone will return to the city, leaving Chulilla empty.\
  \ At least, until next weekend."
