Text: "I don\u2019t normally drop everything I\u2019m doing and leave the country\
  \ with less than nine days to plan a trip but that\u2019s exactly what happened\
  \ when I went to India with Gurmukh Kaur Kalsa, my Kundalini yoga teacher. One coach\
  \ seat opened at the last moment and five days later, my airline ticket arrived.\
  \ I wasn\u2019t exactly sure why I was going to India.\n\nI was searching for my\
  \ serenity and of who I was, after jumping out of a helicopter onto the tallest\
  \ building in Los Angeles, and breaking both of my feet. I was a Hollywood stunt\
  \ woman for two decades but something was telling me it was time to stop rolling\
  \ down flights of stairs, being lit on fire and jumping in front of cars. It was\
  \ time to do some soul-searching to find the next step in my evolution as a woman\
  \ and spiritual being.\n\nBetween the intense wet heat that never lets up and the\
  \ smell of India; the scent of Nag Champra incense, a combination of temples, mosques,\
  \ fresh flowers, decay of the past, saffron, cows, cats, I was intoxicated.  This\
  \ smell still beckons me, even years later, begging me to return for another hit\
  \ of life.\n  \nTo me, India isn't traveling to another country; it is a visit to\
  \ another world, a world where you can sip a cup of chai tea on a street corner\
  \ for hours while watching the leaves drop one after another into the Ganga River\
  \ and feel no guilt about not earning money. A place where cows walk down the street\
  \ and we are all one.  A place where I didn\u2019t need to define myself by my work\
  \ but rather I was present with my inhale and my exhale. Instead of looking to what\
  \ I didn\u2019t have, I was present with what I had, the moment.  I felt blissful,\
  \ peaceful, tranquil, and inspired to live each day as if it was my last. Being\
  \ in India felt like part of me had gone home. In India, you can fly with your breath.\
  \ Now I understand why I went."
