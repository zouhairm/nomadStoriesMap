Text: "Three, two, one... After several hours of driving on the most desolate and,\
  \ in truth, the only freeway in Iceland we find ourselves counting down to the every-eight-minutes\
  \ eruption of the king of Icelandic Geyser Valley -  Strokkur. We check our watches\
  \ and nervously get our camera ready, but the tod catches us unprepared anyway.\
  \ We bounce away astonished as a 20 meters high jet of hot water blows up the limpid\
  \ nordic sky. \nNot a single clear shot on my camera, and yet this moment seems\
  \ to be pictured in my heart with holographic sharpness. \nWe are in Iceland on\
  \ our honeymoon, I still have my bridal veil on, as we left right after the ceremony.\
  \ The two of us fell in love with adventure long before even knowing each other,\
  \ and if we could travel to Iceland by Nautilus we would have done so. As true Jules\
  \ Verne lovers we headed for Snaefell mountain right after our plane landed in Reykjavik\
  \ but the entrance to the center of the Earth appeared less welcoming than we expected.\
  \ The very first August night of our honeymoon passed on the slope of the volcano:\
  \ chilling sleet soaking the thin tarpaulin and violent wind gusts threatening to\
  \ carry our tent miles away. \nThis first-person experience of Icelandic nature\
  \ might explain our genuine joy at the sight of 120\xB0C hot springs the next day.\
  \ It should be noted that we haven\u2019t eaten or drinken anything warmer than\
  \ glacier water for three days and the only thing we had in our travel bag was a\
  \ can of stew. Anyone who once tried to eat cold stew is unlikely to ever forget\
  \ the uninviting sight of it \u2013 gelatinous ice-braking pond. Despite of the\
  \ hunger and the sun rolling over the horizon, me and my newly-wed husband were\
  \ determined to have a dinner of our lifetime. So, we took the precious can and\
  \ made ourselves comfortable around the improvised kitchen \u2013 a boiling stream\
  \ running down from Strokkur itself, a surplus of natural energy. \nIn two weeks\
  \ of our trip we\u2019ve benefit a lot from the generosity of nature, which at the\
  \ first glance from the plane seemed harsh and unfriendly. It was wonderful to adopt\
  \ the custom of Icelanders of starting their day with a hot bath at geothermal springs\
  \ that you find even in the smallest village, to have breakfast with wild berries\
  \ and porridge cooked on the top of sulphurous springs. To feel profound gratitude\
  \ to the Earth and its gifts, embracing the nature and yourself as its integral\
  \ part."
