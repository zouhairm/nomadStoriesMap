Text: "Travelling isn\u2019t always the picnic we try to make it look on Instagram.\
  \ Things go wrong, so perhaps sharing my experience will be cathartic.\n\nLast year\
  \ I spent six months in Colombia, mainly in the second city of Medellin. In the\
  \ course of exploring the country I had become close to a Colombian girl who lived\
  \ in the coastal town of Santa Marta. She spoke no English, but my Spanish was just\
  \ about passable by this point. I was approaching my final week in Colombia, so\
  \ I decided to spend five days with this girl up the Caribbean coast from her hometown.\
  \ I planned it in detail, but fate had other ideas.\n\nThings started to go badly\
  \ on the way to the airport. Traffic caused me to abandon my taxi, and my brisk\
  \ walk became a jog as I feared missing my flight. As I jostled along, the cheap\
  \ Colombian bag I\u2019d bought ripped open leaving my belongings hanging out. Arriving\
  \ at the airport panting and dripping with sweat, I found that my flight was delayed\
  \ by three hours. I didn\u2019t see the funny side.\n\nMy streak continued. Eventually\
  \ arriving to Santa Marta, we headed up the coast the following day. It wasn\u2019\
  t, however, the blazing sunshine that I had thought was ever-present on the coast.\
  \ It was stormy, and had been raining for days. This made our first stop in Tayrona\
  \ Park, inaccessible. We cut it out of the itinerary and headed to nearby Playa\
  \ Grande instead. \n\nThings continued to go wrong thereafter. The hotel in Palomino\
  \ had lost my booking, and was full. The one we found was inferior, and made us\
  \ both grouchy. On the final night, we returned to Santa Marta. We just wanted to\
  \ relax, so I was dispatched to pick up a pizza and bottle of wine. Not realising\
  \ where I was going, I was jumped by three young locals, one of whom waved a knife\
  \ in my face. I obligingly handed over my belongings, and my Semana Mala was complete.\
  \ At least with my camera-phone taken, I had no record of it.\n\nOn reflection,\
  \ it was all worth it. On the night we spent at Playa Grande, we went for a long\
  \ walk on the beach in the evening. Because of recent whether and it being a Monday,\
  \ the beach was empty. At that moment, I suddenly took stock of my situation. I\
  \ had left England with little Spanish and no idea where my travels would take me.\
  \ In my final week in Colombia I found myself walking along a wild, deserted beach,\
  \ under a mesmerising sunset, speaking Spanish with a beguiling local girl. Whatever\
  \ else the rest of the week threw at me, on that beach I felt that my trip was \u2018\
  complete\u2019."
