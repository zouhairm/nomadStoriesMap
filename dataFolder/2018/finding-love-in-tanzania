Text: "I never thought I'd find love when I decided to leave my hometown of Cape Town,\
  \ South Africa, to start a new life in Zanzibar three years ago. Cape Town just\
  \ wasn't the same anymore and after losing my family in a car crash and losing my\
  \ job immediately after, I knew it was time to pack up and move on, far away from\
  \ the Cape.Our family dog, Sandy was still living with me at my parents home. To\
  \ move meant I would have to give up Sandy and I knew how much she meant to my parents.\
  \ I decided to take her to the vet and get her ready for our new adventure together,\
  \ but on the morning of our trip to the vet, I couldn't find her anywhere. I searched\
  \ and searched until I noticed the neighbour's gate was open but they weren't home.\
  \ I heard moaning come from their backyard. The sound I heard didn't prepare me\
  \ for what I was about to see. The neighbour's pitbull had gotten a hold of Sandy\
  \ and ripped her to shreds. I screamed, but it was too late. Sandy was already gone.\
  \ I had to move on, I now had nothing left in Cape Town. \n\nI arrived in Zanzibar,\
  \ Tanzania, on 27 February 2015. I didn't know anyone and nobody knew who I was.\
  \ The only thing the locals knew about me was that I wasn't from here. \nI started\
  \ writing for the local newspaper six months after settling in at my new place.\
  \ It was small and quiet, nothing like the city,\_ but it was enough for me. I remember\
  \ sitting on the beach when I first saw him. Just a glimpse, but I fell in love.\
  \ I was determined to know where he came from. I tried to chase after him but by\
  \ the time I ran to meet him, he has already disappeared. The next few days I searched\
  \ for his face. I would sit and wait at the spot where I first saw him, but he never\
  \ showed up. I decided to give up because he probably belonged to someone else.\
  \ I kept thinking about him. Wondering if he was safe or if the person he was with\
  \ was taking care of him. If he was warm during the night. \n\nA few days later,\
  \ I was sitting on the beach, drinking coconut juice when I felt someone touch my\
  \ back. It was him. He finally found me. His big beautiful brown eyes and tan skin\
  \ was even better up close. I fell in love.He looked at me as if he had been searching\
  \ for me for days. He was the companion I needed after everything I lost in SA.\
  \ I swear I wouldn't let another in but it was as if we were destined to find each\
  \ other. Since that day, Zanzi has been by my side ever since. I fell in love with\
  \ this little dog. And as much as I knew he needed me, I discovered I need him."
