Text: "I haven't been back to Haiti since the earthquake. \nIn 2009 I visited Haiti's\
  \ capital, Port-Au-Prince, for the first time and went back twice more that same\
  \ year. \nThe culture shock began with the locale, all my life I had been used to\
  \ seeing the same grey streets against tall forest pines but now I was feeling the\
  \ hot sun on warped metal roofs and smelling the tropics of island life. \nWhen\
  \ we first arrived at the Guest House I ended up crying off and on throughout the\
  \ night, but going back home was not optional. The Guest House was a place of privilege\
  \ in that it had running water and electricity; I remember those first few days\
  \ being annoyed that the Internet was too slow to load my Facebook.  \nNear the\
  \ end of the trip we visited an orphanage school. I immediately noticed some big\
  \ differences in the classrooms that I was not used to. Instead of sanitized whiteboards\
  \ and neat rows of class work, there were beads hanging from the ceiling, rainbow-colored\
  \ floors (later I realized it was from crushed chalk) and hand-drawn paintings peeled\
  \ off the walls but were only getting ready to be reapplied with another work of\
  \ art. The children took their schoolwork seriously, but a flip was switched as\
  \ soon as we went to the rooftop for recess. We were greeted by a swarm of kids\
  \ running to us, hands open, big smiles, they pulled us into their play place. There\
  \ was no language barrier with the children. I had one curious toddler come sit\
  \ on my lap and reach out and play with a strand of my long black hair, soon others\
  \ joined and before I knew it I had a bunch of girls touching my hair, combing it,\
  \ pulling it in all directions. Normally I don't enjoy sticky fingers anywhere near\
  \ my hair, but for some reason it is one of my fondest memories. I experienced a\
  \ happiness that day that, again, I was incredibly na\xEFve about in that I didn't\
  \ think it was possible. I assumed Haiti was a place that was depressed and serious\
  \ and I felt that I should be depressed and serious in order to avoid the \"American\"\
  \ stigma. But seeing the children being children, I realized happiness is a universal\
  \ language that is available to everyone. \nI don't know what's keeping me from\
  \ going back and visiting. Maybe it is because of the loss of naivety. I don't know\
  \ how many of the children survived. Maybe I don't believe I deserve to go back\
  \ and search for answers. Or, perhaps it is showing me how much more I have to learn\
  \ in knowing that I am afraid of what those answers will ask of me."
