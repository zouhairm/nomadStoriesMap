Text: "3 weeks after getting to India I managed to break my leg, so 2.5 months of\
  \ it I spent with a plaster on. just 3 days after I finally took it off, still early\
  \ able to walk, my boyfriend and I decided to travel to Varanasi with our friends\
  \ to see our first full solar eclipse. the train was suppose to take \"only\" 16\
  \ hours, and we made sure our arrival time was during the day since we had no room\
  \ booked, and also had no intention of experiencing this big city for the first\
  \ time at night. \nwe were 6 friends on that train, we took third class and were\
  \ the only tourists there, so obviously we attracted much attention.at one of the\
  \ quick stops my boyfriend went down to the station to grab us some water, and as\
  \ he was about to come back the train started moving. he had to jump on it. fortunately,\
  \ he made it, but unfortunately the train police saw him. the policeman came to\
  \ warn him that he can get a fine next time he does it, but instead he ended up\
  \ sitting with us, playing music and laughing. he sat with us for a while, and soon\
  \ everyone in our carriage were around us playing, laughing or simply staring. and\
  \ then suddenly the train stopped. we weren't in any station, just in the middle\
  \ of nowhere. the policeman went to check whats going on, and we stayed to wait.\
  \ soon an hour passed and the train still didn't move. we found our policeman and\
  \ he told us that the train hit a  buffalo and the engine is ruined, they wanted\
  \ to send for a new train to pick us up, but they ad no idea where we were. so for\
  \ 6 hours we sat in the heat hoping someone will figure out where we were. this\
  \ was in 2009, phones with GPS weren't a thing yet. \neventually as evening started\
  \ falling a new train arrived and took us all to Varanasi. we got there at 1 am.\
  \ we decided to split into 2 groups of 3 so it will be easier for us to find a place\
  \ to stay for the night. the 3 of us took a rickshaw driver that drove us all around\
  \ Varanasi for about an hour and tried to rob us. luckily for us another rickshaw\
  \ driver saw it and came for our help. eventually around 3 am we managed to find\
  \ a room. we only had a few hours to sleep because the eclipse happened early morning.\
  \ \nas soon as the sun came up we went down to Marnikarnika ghat, took a little\
  \ boat  on the Ganges and waited for the day to turn into night. there were 4 million\
  \ people there that day, and as the moon covered the sun they were all in complete\
  \ silence. as hard as the journey was, that magical moment was worth it all."
