Text: "Halfway through an exploratory year spent in China, my wife and I along with\
  \ two friends decided to escape from the industrious madness of our densely populated\
  \ city of 13 million people to seek adventure in the mysterious land of Siam. Of\
  \ course, I had it planned down to the last detail. AND, I bought a book on traveling\
  \ to Thailand and Cambodia. Surmise it to say that our arrival at the Cambodian\
  \ border, following an overnight in Bangkok, and a four hour ride on a coal burning\
  \ train, sandwiched among 50 Thai acquaintances did not disappoint. As an astute\
  \ observer, I quickly gathered that the end of our train ride did not bring us to\
  \ the border, instead having to ride tuk tuks (Thai for taxi) to the border. I also\
  \ keenly deduced that all Thai tuk tuk drivers have a tacit agreement to take all\
  \ earnest American and European-looking adventurers, to the \u201Cborder office\u201D\
  \ to pay for new passport photos. These being enterprising individuals, who could\
  \ expect any less? Many \u201Cno thank you\"s landed us outside the \u201Cborder\
  \ office\u201D hoofing it to the nearest crossing, not a cent lighter than we had\
  \ entered, I might add. \nWith the sun falling from its apex, our motley crew of\
  \ three Americans and our Chinese friend found ourselves faced with endless lines\
  \ fraught with tourists (less qualified than us, of course) snaking around an inappropriate\
  \ amount of stanchions. We being efficient, order-driven Americans, led the charge\
  \ to the back of the line. As drew close enough to recognize the various lines for\
  \ travelers by country of origin, it dawned slowly upon me that our first-time international\
  \ traveling companion from China probably had not though to buy a visa. Not only\
  \ that, but there was no designated line for Chinese citizens. Recognizing our blunder,\
  \ we hailed the nearest Thai official (this is easy to do if you have red hair and\
  \ appear to be having a panic attack). As the Thai official escorted our friend\
  \ to sit on the side of the room to watch us slowly snake closer to the border,\
  \ I could not help thinking, I may have missed a detail when planning. \nWe drew\
  \ nearer to the front of the line and farther from our friend, growing increasingly\
  \ more apprehensive of crossing the border without our friend. Yet, approximately\
  \ half an hour later, we rushed to meet our friend on the other side of the border,\
  \ elated, but confused about his miraculous change in fortune. A man of few words,\
  \ he stated \u201CI paid the guy to let me across\u201D happily showing us his Cambodian\
  \ visa."
