Text: "\u201CHow would I get to England\u201D Kate asked as we chatted in the yard\
  \ over soap suds and clothes encrusted with African dust. The sun beat down on her\
  \ dark skin and a bead of perspiration ran unchecked down her cheek. I wasn't sure\
  \ what she meant, so I described the airport and flight. She looked up from her\
  \ task, pondering my reply. \n\n\u201CAre there roads in the sky for the aeroplanes?\u201D\
  \ she asked, looking towards the downy clouds. I tried to picture her \"sky roads\"\
  . Though the same age, our lives were worlds apart. Under a scorching sun with the\
  \ fiery red dust beneath our feet my world was full of possibility. Kate's bare\
  \ feet walked the same dusty road as mine to \"home\", but our lives were destined\
  \ to follow different paths. \n\nMy African \"sister\" had an innocence that I was\
  \ immediately drawn to. She knew so little of the world outside her Aunt's home,\
  \ I knew so little of her world. Yet despite our differences our laughter could\
  \ often be heard, like that of the local children, resonating between the thatched\
  \ huts of the village.  \nThose early days were characterised for me by a childlike\
  \ innocence. Eyes experiencing the vivid colours of life for the first time. Lips\
  \ dissolving into laughter as they tried to respond to the greetings of the brightly\
  \ dressed village women. \n\n\"Anowla\" I greeted warmly.\n\n\"Naa\" came the friendly\
  \ reply.\n\nOver the years I wrote my own story of Africa. The way the red dust\
  \ saturated my heart. The way the laughing faces of the schoolgirls captured my\
  \ imagination. I hoped that when the sun sank below the dusty horizon and the scorched\
  \ trees soaked up the last of its dying rays, that the day for someone had ended\
  \ a little better than it began. That perhaps I had made a difference. \n\nNo matter\
  \ our background or circumstance, we do not know the lives we shape or the impact\
  \ we have. I do not know whether the lives of those I have loved have been better\
  \ or unchanged by the crossing of our paths. What I do know is the impact that those\
  \ people had on me. \n\nBeneath Ghana's burning sun and its huge expanse of star\
  \ studded sky, I learned to laugh and cry. I learned the meaning of love and loss;\
  \ the art of friendship and the importance of companionship. I lost friends I had\
  \ come to love to the cruelty of preventable disease. I stopped being a child and\
  \ I became a woman and while I inevitably eventually took Kate's \"Sky Roads\" back\
  \ home and on to other worlds, I left a part of my heart scrubbing clothes in the\
  \ dusty yard, laughing with my best friend."
