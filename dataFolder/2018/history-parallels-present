Text: "The first thing I noticed as entered the Old Town Square was the row of police\
  \ on horseback. They rode four abreast, hooves clopping on cobblestones echoing\
  \ against buildings in the strangely deserted square. It was usually plagued by\
  \ tourists this time of day, shortly before locals end their work day and the happy\
  \ hour began in earnest. It was my last day in Prague before taking a night train\
  \ to Budapest. \n\nI just left the Museum of Communism and had no plans for the\
  \ next six hours before my train. I followed the police and started to to hear the\
  \ noise of a crowd and techno music echoing throughout the streets thinking I had\
  \ come upon a festival or performance and counted myself fortunate. People were\
  \ everywhere milling about with posters on sticks I couldn\u2019t read, but most\
  \ had their backs to me. I searched for the source of the activity since both the\
  \ police and crowd were facing one direction which led me to Wenceslas Square. There\
  \ was a small stage with a few people speaking and about 25 people in front of the\
  \ stage listening to them. I returned to the much larger crowd and music a block\
  \ away and began to recognize words they were chanting: Alerta! Alerta! Antifacista!\
  \ There were police in riot gear, but it felt like the biggest party celebrating\
  \ democracy I have ever witnessed. \n\nI had encountered the counter-rally protesting\
  \ fascist speakers in an incredibly important place on an incredibly important anniversary.\
  \ This was where student Jan Palach set himself on fire to protest the invasion\
  \ of Czechoslovakia by the Soviet Union in 1969. It was also November 17, 2013,\
  \ the 24th anniversary of the day the Velvet Revolution peacefully toppled Communism\
  \ in what was then Czechoslovakia. I was shocked and horrified that these fascists\
  \ would hold a rally in such a historic place, on such an important day. It was\
  \ wonderful to see the hundreds of people who came to protest the handful of people\
  \ succumbing to fear and advocating hate. \n\nThis was the first time I encountered\
  \ a fascist demonstration. I was aware these people existed, but thought they were\
  \ the last dregs of old politics and that the world had learned its lesson from\
  \ WWII. After spending time with the protesters, I felt distraught there were people\
  \ who denied the lessons of history and advocated insularism and fear, but so uplifted\
  \ there were many more people fighting against them, actively and with music. Since\
  \ then, it has become clear that this incident was just the start of so much more\
  \ to come."
