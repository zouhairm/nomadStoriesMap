Text: "The old town was thriving as midnight crept upon the city with Queen square\
  \ proudly illuminated in wake of Las Fallas. Foreign tongues bustled out of bars\
  \ sprawling onto the sidewalks evocative of animals staggering down to the watering\
  \ hole in summer. The bar reeked odours of cerveza and cigarrillos. The two women\
  \ took a seat next to me. Sun kissed olive skin; a flowery fragrance lingered in\
  \ the air leaving me tongue-tied. As conversation grew I became more at ease, they\
  \ were true raconteurs as if they had done this a thousand times. Conversation and\
  \ drinks flowing in unison. In high spirits I offered to buy a round. Exotic faces\
  \ exchanged words followed by the bartender bringing the drinks. Alas shortly afterwards\
  \ they bid me farewell with a kiss on the cheek and nervous smiles. El Miguelete\
  \ eerily rang twice in the distance. A signal to leave perhaps. The bartender ushered\
  \ me to the cash register, a bear-like paw upon my shoulder. \"\u20AC500.\" Humour\
  \ struck first thinking it to be a jest. This was instantaneously replaced by a\
  \ gut-punching sense of dread from the reaction of the bartender. A bald-headed\
  \ stern meaty face glaring at me. A scene from the O.K. Corral waiting for the fast\
  \ draw. \"How can it be \u20AC500!\" The words bursting out. A lethal concoction\
  \ of emotions brewing. A catalyst for disaster. \"The two drinks you bought those\
  \ women were the most expensive drinks in the bar.\" A greasy smirk antagonising\
  \ the situation. Silence haunted the room. I glanced over my shoulder noticing all\
  \ eyes were fixated in my direction. Wide eyed creatures in the darkness homing\
  \ in on prey. Everything became a blur with primal instincts taking hold. His face\
  \ as red as furnace fire. Frothing at the mouth. He lunged in my direction grabbing\
  \ my jumper and launching me into a wall. Before I could even apprehend the situation\
  \ he swarmed over me; an overpowering shadow. A jagged object poked into my pale\
  \ limp skin. He screamed foreign obscenities, his saliva clubbing my face. Utter\
  \ helplessness washed through me. Warm salty tears pouring out. \"I will take you\
  \ to the ATM and you will give your money!\" His hand a vice-like grip upon my shoulder.\
  \ He unlocked the door and we began the descent of the staircase. Fight or flight\
  \ took hold. I dashed forward releasing from his grip, crashing down the stairs.\
  \ Adrenaline afforded me no pain. I lept up. Sprinting. Not looking back until Ciutat\
  \ Vella gloomed afar in the distance. Collapsing onto the floor transforming into\
  \ puddles of tears."
