Text: "Wind blew the curtain in the hallway into a colorful dance, sunlight pouring\
  \ into our room. My roommate, Gabe, stretched into the space between our beds and\
  \ slipped into sneakers. As morning stiffness wore off, I dressed, and we escaped\
  \ to the streets. For a month this was our routine, and the city, our home. There\
  \ is a unique closeness in waking up with someone, eating with someone, and moving\
  \ in unison with them. Gabe and I moved like this, but there was a parallel movement:\
  \ our growing awareness of Sevilla. \n\nDay by day, habit and routine allowed me\
  \ to feel like a part of the city. I memorized each walk down twisting cobblestone\
  \ from our apartment to the Plaza Nueva, first passing the ever-running fountain,\
  \ then the rows of tourist shops, and finally the towering cathedral. Our days began\
  \ in an hour-long rush to buy coffee and linger in the late morning air before the\
  \ sun began to sear. We then retreated to the shelter of our host-house for the\
  \ hottest hours of the day. Even then, I longed to be outside, watching the light\
  \ fade and make its exchange with golden streetlamps.\n \nWhen we weren\u2019t exploring\
  \ the vibrant streets, we were in class. Our assignment was to make a short documentary\
  \ featuring the unique culture and perspectives around us. I focused on the controversy\
  \ surrounding transgender people using public bathrooms, an issue close to my heart\
  \ because of my own transgender identity. I wondered if this was a distinctly \u201C\
  American\u201D conflict. \n\nI set up my camera at a table outside of a coffee shop,\
  \ watching crowds of people flock towards the plaza. Nervously, I approached passersby\
  \ and asked for their thoughts, referring to the questions I had scribbled on a\
  \ scrap of paper. I was not entirely surprised by what the locals told me in their\
  \ relaxed Spanish; they were conscious of homophobia and transphobia, but saw much\
  \ less of it in Spain than in the United States. I found that the resentful tolerance\
  \ of LGBTQ people I\u2019ve experienced in the US is not ubiquitous, as I had come\
  \ to believe, but that I am a part of a wider global community.\n\nNearing the end\
  \ of my trip, goodbyes at the end of each night became more reluctant. I finished\
  \ editing the film: a process of translating each interview, capturing each narrative.\
  \ Even over a year later, I look back with hope on the testimonies I gathered. And\
  \ over a year later, my life has taken on a gold-tinged glow like that of Sevilla,\
  \ and I carry the drive to bridge cultural divides with me into my future."
