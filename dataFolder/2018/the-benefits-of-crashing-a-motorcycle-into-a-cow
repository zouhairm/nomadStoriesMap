Text: "I had imagined a range of catastrophes which might bring this trip to an end:\
  \ tumbling down a mountainside, detainment due to accidental trespassing, any number\
  \ of mechanical issues associated with attempting to ride a motorcycle off-road\
  \ coast to coast. This one was a surprise.\n \nThree miles into Nevada along the\
  \ Trans America Trail, an assemblage of dirt trails stretching across the USA, my\
  \ forward progress was transferred into the cow I just crashed into while I lay\
  \ on my back amid a fog of dirt and metal shavings. Yet another of many unique lessons\
  \ learned on the route: cows are deceptively agile when spooked. This becomes a\
  \ very specific concern after six reflex-dumbing hours piloting a glorified lawnmower\
  \ through the open ranges of the West.\n \nSeveral minutes of righting myself along\
  \ with some percussive maintenance with a rock to render some bent metal pieces\
  \ straight-ish and the bike was mobile again. My shoulder was much less so but enough\
  \ to get me back to civilization: Baker, pop. 68, and just big enough for one motel\
  \ and a diner decorated with old vacuum cleaners. It was a fitting backdrop to reevaluate\
  \ the sanity of continuing this whole ordeal.\n \nNursing stale coffee and fresh\
  \ bruises the next morning, I sat on the fringes of other riders on their way to\
  \ Great Basin National Park. Brooding over topo maps only amplified doubts about\
  \ tackling the most remote section yet. I shoved them aside, only then overhearing\
  \ a friendly interrogation of another solo rider I had failed to notice in a corner\
  \ booth. He spoke with a British accent - a strange feature in this part of the\
  \ country. Unless\u2026\n\u201CI\u2019m riding the Trans America Trail.\u201D\n\
  \ \nThe social clouds parted and I jumped into his booth, both of us exchanging\
  \ volleys of road stories.\n\u201CI almost got hit by lightning in Oklahoma!\u201D\
  \n\u201CI had to camp on a mountainside in Utah after my bike got stuck in mud!\u201D\
  \n\u201CI just hit a cow yesterday!\u201D\n\u201CI\u2026 wait, you what?\u201D\n\
  Suddenly it was even funny to me.\n \nWe agreed to ride together and sped off shortly\
  \ after, riding a minor stretch of pavement to the next trail turnoff which I promptly\
  \ missed. Looping back around, I followed in his dust contrail. One major pothole\
  \ later and suddenly I was riding through a cloud of toiletries, his dopp kit erupting\
  \ from a saddlebag he had neglected to secure. I stopped next to the resulting debris\
  \ field to flag him down and get my laughing under control, all the while silently\
  \ thanking a cow for an enforced pause and an unlikely connection."
