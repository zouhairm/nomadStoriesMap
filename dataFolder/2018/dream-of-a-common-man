Text: "It had always been my dream to witness the beauty of a place which hosts both\
  \ the mountains and the seas. Mauritius was one such place. I had been working as\
  \ a software engineer for the last 6 years but hadn't been able to accumulate enough\
  \ funds for fulfilling my dream. I had to meet the necessities of a common middle-class\
  \ family which did not enable me to save much. It was time to decide on my honeymoon\
  \ trip and I took up the bold decision of making my dream come true. I had been\
  \ planning for one whole year on how to manage all the expenses. I had maintained\
  \ an excel sheet to keep a track of the wedding expenses as well as the Mauritius\
  \ trip. I had applied for personal loans to banks and my applications got approved\
  \ to a certain extent. Keeping aside all the wedding expenses it was still difficult\
  \ to manage the trip. I booked the trip through an online portal using my credit\
  \ card. I was devoid of cash at that time but i held on to my determination. I knew\
  \ I will be able to work hard and pay off my dues in the near future. I challenged\
  \ myself and booked the trip. I got full mental support from my family and my fiance.\
  \ \nWe got married and our honeymoon trip was on. Mauritius was even more beautiful\
  \ than i had ever dreamt of . It was a seven day trip. The moment I stepped out\
  \ of the airport i could feel the fresh air filling my lungs. We reach Hotel Zilwa\
  \ Altitude in an hour. The clean roads, the greenery outlining the roads were extremely\
  \ welcoming. The blue mountains separating the fields from the clear blue skies\
  \ were a treat to the eyes. Just before reaching the hotel situated on the northernmost\
  \ coast of the country, our eyes fell on the deep blue ocean at a distance. On reaching\
  \ the hotel the first view of the ocean was breathtaking. The reception was right\
  \ in front of the sea and in between were the swimming pools of the resort. The\
  \ next day we were taken for the north island tour. The first photostop was a picturesque\
  \ beach adorned with crystal clear blue water and dark black rocks. It truly felt\
  \ like a paradise on earth. The rest of the day was spent  visiting the Caudan Waterfront,\
  \ Port Louis, Marie Reine de la Paix, Citadel Fort and a few more places. The next\
  \ day was full of fun-filled activities. We did undersea walk, speedboat ride, kayaking\
  \ and the best of the lot, parasailing. The bird's eye view of the sea from the\
  \ sky was captivating. The trip ended two years back and I had worked really hard,\
  \ earned more and cleared off all my dues."
