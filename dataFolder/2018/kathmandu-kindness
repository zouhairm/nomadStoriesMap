Text: "I will forever be amazed and inspired by the simple acts of kindness shown\
  \ by many people throughout the world. Kindness is allowing our two friends, ego\
  \ and pride, to take a rest and selflessly promote one another. When they collaborate,\
  \ the day is brighter and the eyes see a world through compassion, honesty and love.\n\
  \nMeet Nakul, the local owner of his family run hotel hidden amongst the bustling\
  \ alleys of Kathmandu. He is a man with dark features, a broad beaming smile, eyes\
  \ that say welcome and energy which emanates safety. A man who has lost almost everything.\
  \ A man who taught me my greatest lessons. \n\nHe wears beige pants and a white\
  \ cotton shirt as he bounds around the courtyard cuddling and roughing up his fluffy\
  \ dog, Forest. From the outset you see a happy man, who leads his life with an understanding\
  \ of peace and consideration. Without investing the time to hear someone and the\
  \ desire to get to know a person we can never fully appreciate the complexity of\
  \ the human spirit. \n\nNakul manages the hotel with his family and after spending\
  \ quite some time, getting to know who they are, I feel they have grown to be my\
  \ Nepalese family too. A group of young men who had lost the rest of their families\
  \ in the tragic 2014 landslides. The same group of men who remained for weeks after\
  \ the event happened to search for their family members and any remains of their\
  \ previous life. \n\nThis family has endured hardships beyond our imagination yet\
  \ they wake up and face every day with a smile on their faces and their hearts full\
  \ of gratitude. Nakul would talk endlessly about his adventures into the mountains\
  \ and the connection he felt to his home. He shared a wealth of information with\
  \ us but without realising it he had taught us our greatest lesson of all. Have\
  \ courage and be kind but most importantly share this with everyone who enters into\
  \ your life. Even if it is for a flickering moment.\n\nFrom the moment we met him\
  \ he took genuine interest in our stories, invested time to listen, answering our\
  \ many questions, translating the essentials to survive politely in a foreign country\
  \ and shared his knowledge on how to keep two girls safe and well when travelling\
  \ in Nepal. At Nakul\u2019s hotel you will find so much more than a clean, spacious\
  \ place to rest your head. If you open yourself up to the opportunity you will find\
  \ your own Kathmandu home away from home."
