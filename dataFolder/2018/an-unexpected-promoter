Text: "It all started suddenly. I was in Bordeaux in France, I had just started my\
  \ semester of study abroad, I was at an international dinner organized by my host\
  \ university, along with a few hundred other international students. The situation\
  \ was pleasant and I knew new people of different nationalities from all over the\
  \ world. At one point ,inebriated by the many knowledge and by the happy moment\
  \ my mind stopped for a moment and focused on an idea: \"We organize a trip !!!\
  \ \", so I turned to my friend mate Lorenzo,\" Let's spread the word, let's say\
  \ it to all the guys who are present here now, WE LEAVE SUNDAY \". And so it was,\
  \ we began to tell everyone, whoever was present in that room. The following day\
  \ I had to follow my courses at the faculty where I was studying. I was very keen\
  \ to above all to create a link with other French students. I really cared about\
  \ it but it was not easy to integrate with them, unlike international students.\
  \ \"Escuse Moi le gars\", at the first university lesson I address myself to the\
  \ entire class that was waiting for the beginning of the lesson. With my French\
  \ still in progress I suggest everyone to come to the trip I had proposed the day\
  \ before at the international dinner. The guys mumble with each other and I perceive\
  \ their amazement (surely for my accent) but we also catch a glimpse of some curiosity.\
  \ In any case I had nothing to lose and I also continued outside the class to publicize\
  \ my event stopping anyone I met. \nI had set the appointment at the railway station\
  \ for the following Sunday, I had created an event on facebook to keep well the\
  \ organization and the contacts with the guys. Despite the commitment I had made\
  \ in the organization, I still expected that in the end only the guys with whom\
  \ I had a closer relationship would come really. We all meet then at the prefixed\
  \ place we were about twenty in all and we leave for the time of Arcachon a town\
  \ near Bordeaux. I receive the best surprise when I arrive in the city. Most of\
  \ the boys had not found the meeting point and had climbed directly into the train.\
  \ So we find ourselves in Arcachon with a group of more than 100 people from every\
  \ country in the world. Throughout the duration of my Erasmus I have organized other\
  \ trips and events that have helped to make numerous links between people especially\
  \ between French and foreign children."
