Text: "There\u2019s an ongoing joke amongst travelers that we never bother to experience\
  \ our own homeland.  I try to be an exception to this and will periodically convince\
  \ myself to venture elsewhere in Canada.\nTo say Canada is huge is an understatement.\
  \ Even leaving my own province means travelling the span of multiple European countries.\
  \ And making it all the way to Prince Edward Island from Toronto is like travelling\
  \ to a whole other part of the world.\nLife seems to slow down on the east coast.\
  \ I\u2019m used to the hustle and bustle of Toronto, so biking around the tiny island\
  \ on my own for a whole week was a totally different experience. There were so few\
  \ people that I passed along my trip that I was starting to feel a bit lonely and\
  \ restless by the time I arrived in Summerside.\nThe owners of the B&B I stayed\
  \ in were typically islanders \u2013 relaxed, friendly, helpful, and full of suggestions\
  \ of what to do in their small city. The local theatre\u2019s biopic on Stompin\u2019\
  \ Tom Connors was top of their list. I was embarrassed to admit I didn\u2019t know\
  \ who he was, but the owner raved about it and insisted it had turned him from a\
  \ hater into a lover of the man\u2019s music. I was eager to get out and do something\
  \ new that night, so a few hours later I was in possession of a ticket to that evening\u2019\
  s performance.\nBeing used to Toronto\u2019s Mirvish theatres, I found myself cramped\
  \ and practically sitting on the Quebecois gentleman beside me. But for the cheapest\
  \ ticket price, I\u2019d gotten a seat better than any I could have afforded back\
  \ home.\nThe show was more than worth it.\nThrough the life and songs of Tom Connors\
  \ in those few hours, I connected more with Canada than every droning high school\
  \ history class I\u2019d ever sat through.\nThe man was rightfully a Canadian legend\
  \ and I sat both in shame of my ignorance, and awe of the small but wonderful production.\
  \ The majority of his songs were truly Canadian with a sense of humour indicative\
  \ of the Maritimes. He\u2019d been born on the east coast, and due to an unstable\
  \ family life, been forced to travel around most of the county, experiencing more\
  \ of it than most Canadians ever will. From singing about the tobacco fields in\
  \ Tillsonburg to the \u201CGood Ol\u2019 Hockey Game,\u201D he\u2019d made a career\
  \ and legacy singing folk stories about Canada.\nThe owner of the B&B was right.\
  \ I had thoroughly enjoyed the small production. Not only had I become a fan of\
  \ a man I\u2019d never heard of before, but I was somehow even more attached to\
  \ my homeland."
