Text: "I circled the cathedral with my camera clenched in my hand.  My eyes scanned\
  \ every crevice trying to find one tufted corner that wasn\u2019t crumbling; one\
  \ lion head that wasn\u2019t disintegrating into dust.  But squished between the\
  \ searing Nicaraguan sun and the heat that rose up in a haze from the cement, the\
  \ old church just couldn\u2019t keep itself together.  \nCentral America was the\
  \ first place I had ever wandered outside of the U.S. and the safety warnings repeated\
  \ like alarms in my head: keep your money strapped to your body, don\u2019t wear\
  \ jewelry or nice clothes, and most importantly, don\u2019t wander alone.  But as\
  \ I tried in vain to find a perfect picture of the church, I broke the golden rule:\
  \ I lost my friends and I was petrified.\nMy plan was simple: sit still and try\
  \ to look unapproachable.  It didn\u2019t work.  Everyone in the square came over\
  \ to me, and I refused each of them.\nBut then a young boy approached me, looked\
  \ right into my face, and asked me what I was doing.  Caught in his gaze I forgot\
  \ about being tough and blurted out, \u201CI lost my friends.\u201D  He put his\
  \ little hand on my knee and told me not to worry.  His concern was adorable- and\
  \ it was also strangely comforting.  But then he asked if he could shine my shoes.\
  \  \n \u201CI will make them beautiful,\u201D he insisted, \u201CPlease?\u201D \
  \ I didn\u2019t want beautiful shoes, but I did want his tiny companionship.  So\
  \ I unbuckled my filthy sandal and gave it to him.\nHe worked carefully and slowly,\
  \ scrubbing each seam in the leather and polishing away every speck of dirt I had\
  \ accumulated in the past week.  While he scuffed and wiped, I spoke to him in broken\
  \ Spanish.  He corrected each mistake with a sly grin that made us both laugh. \
  \ When he finished, he proudly lifted both gleaming sandals into the air for me\
  \ to admire.  I poured a pile of coins into his hand and asked, \u201CWhat are you\
  \ going to buy?\u201D  He looked up, smiled wide, and said, \u201CMaybe I will get\
  \ shoes someday.\u201D\nMy head dropped and for the first time I noticed his bare\
  \ feet.  It wasn\u2019t pity I felt; it was shame.  That shoe-less boy had shown\
  \ more compassion to me than I had offered anyone that day.  I watched him walk\
  \ away across the hot cement, but he never left my mind.  \nNow, years later, new\
  \ thoughts repeat like alarms in my head when I travel: you don\u2019t have to abandon\
  \ your humanity to be safe, children are the best foreign language teachers, and\
  \ most importantly, facades are meant to fall apart- especially if they are your\
  \ own."
