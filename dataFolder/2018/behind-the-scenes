Text: "Puerto Escondido is a small surf town in Oaxaca, Mexico. One of life\u2019\
  s greatest pleasures is laying out on the beach, feeling the warmth of the sun,\
  \ and taking in the beauty of the ocean. Puerto Escondido was the perfect place\
  \ for my next family vacation and film project.\n\nMy goal was to produce a travel\
  \ show where locals recommend things to do in the city. I called it \u2018Beyond\
  \ the Horizon.\u2019  There were a few interested locals, one of them was Lucano.\
  \ He was passionate about the city and was excited to be a part of the project.\n\
  \nAfter 20 hours of travel, we arrived to the house we would call home for the next\
  \ ten days. The weather was warm and we were surrounded by lush trees and blue skies.\n\
  \nI scheduled a few shoots with Lucano. He wanted to meet before so a few of us\
  \ took a taxi to a nearby bar. There were a couple pool tables, a jukebox, bottles\
  \ hanging off the wall and good beer on draft. I recognized Lucano and greeted him\
  \ with a huge smile. We talked, played pool and shared beers and stories. We left\
  \ and confirmed the next day\u2019s shoot, surfing at Zicatela, a local beach notorious\
  \ for it\u2019s huge waves.\n\nThe current was strong at Zicatela Beach and I didn\u2019\
  t feel confident filming in the water. I stayed on shore and got some great shots\
  \ there. I thought the waves were big but Lucano and his friends assured me that\
  \ these were small waves.\n\nLucano frequented a nearby estuary and thought that\
  \ would make a good segment as well. He took my whole family in his car. The sun\
  \ was setting at the time and the sky was a slight purple. There were birds flying\
  \ overhead and some walking around in the distance. The estuary is where the river\
  \ meets the ocean so the wildlife is varied and unique. It is interesting to see\
  \ two bodies of water virtually side by side. Each a beautiful force on its own\
  \ but so complex and interesting when feeding off of each other.\n\nFor the dining\
  \ segment, Lucano recommended a great place for dinner, Espadin Restaurant. It overlooks\
  \ Carizalillo beach. The gorgeous view made for some great shots. We saw whales\
  \ in ocean as the sunset. Behind the scenes, my family grabbed a table and Lucano\
  \ along with his wife and son joined us. It was so nice to meet and spend time with\
  \ his beautiful family. The sun was setting so there were warm tones of orange and\
  \ pink in the sky. It was picture perfect.\n\nA family trip turned film shoot. I\
  \ filmed so much and was certain I had what I needed for my project. I flew back\
  \ with great footage and even better memories."
