Text: "Sometimes, visiting the same place for over six years can mean that wanderlust\
  \ becomes wander dust. Nevertheless, my recommendation to visit this charming little\
  \ Spanish town comes completely without reserve. Mijas Pueblo nestles itself proudly\
  \ in the mountains of the Costa del Sol. It\u2019s whitewashed houses shimmer across\
  \ the gentle mountainous slopes. Elderly women with wrinkled faces and withered\
  \ sandals hunch over broomsticks in the bright, white heat. Mops and brooms taunt\
  \ at tired ankles and the bristles of every Andaluc\xEDan paintbrush have only ever\
  \ tasted white emulsion. The preservation of Mijas Pueblo is not a competition between\
  \ scrupulous street sharers or neurotic neighbours, rather a communal consensus,\
  \ to keep the village shining from its mountainous nest. \n\nPre-siesta, I make\
  \ my way into town and I am met with an unfamiliar Senora. 'Hola.' Nothing. Instead\
  \ she spits out invisible sunflower shells through her brown teeth on to the over-swept\
  \ street. I go inside a shop and she bullishly boycotts past me as though I am as\
  \ invisible as her etiquette. Her malevolent glare follows me suspiciously as I\
  \ hide behind hanging hogs legs, colonized by houseflies. Perhaps she can sense\
  \ my ever-decreasing enthusiasm for her hometown and is insulted at the concept\
  \ that someone could grow tired of its immense cultural offering.  \nI decide I\
  \ am in no mood to be glared/shoved/ tsked at. I have been visiting for 6 years!\
  \ I put my things down, reluctant to distrub what she is using as a resting post,\
  \ and notice her withered, old hands, splashed with gold rings and white paint.\
  \ The hands of an old woman who has been working hard to preserve and present her\
  \ hometown.My self-taught Spanish is under scrutiny here as I request a handbag\
  \ rather than a groceries bag.\n\u2018Un bolso, por favor?\u2019 \u2018Una bols-AH\u2019\
  \ ,the elderly woman corrects me, \u2018Bols \u2013ah, ah, ah\u2019  She makes the\
  \ AH sound three times and I mimic her like a toddler would its mother.\u2018Ahh,\
  \ una Bolsa, ah, ah ,ah\u2019  The little Spanish lady maternally licks her finger\
  \ as if she is going to wipe something off my face. My humiliated expression perhaps.\
  \ She delicately takes a bag from my hands and with her paint-stained finger opens\
  \ it up. I pack my purchases into the bols-AH and for a very brief moment, we are\
  \ a team. \nI smile to myself as I am reminded of why we wander, why we wanderlust."
