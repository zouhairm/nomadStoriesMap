Text: "Standing on the black beaches of Martinique, the Caribbean Sea tickling at\
  \ your feet, the view of the peak of Mount Pel\xE9e is a sight to see, but also\
  \ a sight that is not so often to-be-seen. As the highest peak of the volcanic island,\
  \ it\u2019s often covered by clouds. We were at the village of Saint-Pierre. It\
  \ used to be the center of Martinique, until the volcano erupted in 1902 killing\
  \ 30,000 people.\nAnd this peak of 1,397 meters was our destination.\nThe starting\
  \ point of our trek was at 822 meters. Half climbing on the slippery lava rock,\
  \ we got to first refuge, and had a choice to make. It felt as if one of those personality\
  \ tests: \u2018which door will you choose, which path will you continue your journey\
  \ on?\u2019 On our left, there was a steep descent to darkness and on our right,\
  \ a steady-looking path in the middle of some hay. We could either descend to the\
  \ caldera, and summit, or go around the caldera, climbing up and down the peak of\
  \ the Caribbean Coast side, followed by the summit. Most people seemed to go straight\
  \ down the caldera. We decided to take the longer route.\nIt was a strenuous trek,\
  \ however, featured with that weird tingling sensation of knowing that any misstep\
  \ could lead into falling a long way down. We came to the coast side, having already\
  \ spent almost 4 hours on the volcano. It took us half an hour to climb up the steep\
  \ peak that wasn\u2019t even our final destination. It was exhausting. Right before\
  \ reaching the top, there was a boulder that loomed over the steep ground. I wasn\u2019\
  t tall enough to use my legs for support \u2013 my only option was to use my arms\
  \ to lift myself up, legs dangling in the air.\nI grabbed the boulder, but couldn\u2019\
  t find the emotional strength to take the leap: had I lost my grip I would\u2019\
  ve rolled down some 100 meters. Suddenly, I couldn\u2019t breathe, my eyesight blurring.\
  \ I realized I was having a panic attack in the worst possible place. Tears gathered\
  \ in my eyes, as I understood one thing. I couldn\u2019t go on.\nIt pushed me, quite\
  \ literally, to the edge of my limit, for me to work my way back down the peak.\
  \ Not this time. Deciding to go back was difficult, but important.\nThat evening,\
  \ standing on the beach again watching Mount Pel\xE9e basking in sunset, I felt\
  \ surprisingly serene, and resolved. It was the first volcano I attempted to climb.\
  \ The failure to summit made me more determined than ever. I knew then that eventually\
  \ I would climb this volcano, and many more. I had met my boundary, and now I could\
  \ start working on crossing it."
