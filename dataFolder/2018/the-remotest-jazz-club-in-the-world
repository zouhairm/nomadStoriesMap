Text: "The ferocious Amazonian heat refused to thaw my fear as I remained rooted to\
  \ the ground, as motionless as the murumuru trees that towered above me, but as\
  \ powerless as the wilted forest vines that lay shrivelled and trodden beneath my\
  \ feet. I was alone in the heart of the world\u2019s largest rainforest. At least,\
  \ that\u2019s what it felt like.\n\nI looked down at the expectant predators below.\
  \ My trembling hands touched the yellowed ivory, fatigued by decades of good use\
  \ and poor maintenance, no match for the humidity of Northern Brazil.\n\n\u201C\
  You can actually play the piano, right?\u201D Tau\xE3 whispered, fretfully. \n\u201C\
  Of course\u201D I replied, my voice enveloped in uncertainty.\n\n\nIt was at a tapioca\
  \ stand in Manaus, amidst the crumbling colonial majesty of a city whose glory had\
  \ long passed, that Tau\xE3 convinced me to play piano at his jazz bar.\nA man of\
  \ indigenous origins, his embrace of jazz was emblematic of Brazil\u2019s great\
  \ diversity, its habit of mixing cultures. Or perhaps it was reflective of a colonised\
  \ soul, his musical love as out of place here as the opera house that loomed above\
  \ us. Such peculiar marriages of culture could only ever have occurred in this enigmatic\
  \ land.\n\n\u201CThe plantain\u2019s good\u201D Tau\xE3 offered, sensing my indecisiveness.\n\
  \nI nodded gratefully and proceeded to order.\n\nFatigued by the merciless December\
  \ sun, we stood in silence, hypnotised by the tapioca flour as it was sprinkled\
  \ over the hot plate. In an instant, the atoms of flour harmonised into a single,\
  \ crepe-like mass. No constitution could ever unite this vast country of contradictions\
  \ like heat unites tapioca flour.\n\nEventually, Tau\xE3 broke the silence: \u201C\
  So will you play?\u201D.  His face was weary, weathered by decades of hardship like\
  \ the cathedral across the square, built by colonists who fled the city as soon\
  \ as they had bled the once bountiful lands dry.\n\nThe sun had won its war of attrition\
  \ against my resolve: \u201COkay then\u201D.\n\nWe crossed the river leaving the\
  \ city behind, plunging into the dense unknown of Iranduba. The frenetic sounds\
  \ of Manaus were gradually usurped by a welcome tranquillity. An orchestra of macaws\
  \ squawking and crickets chirping rehearsed in the distance as the setting sun ignited\
  \ the river orange.\n\nThe bar was no more than a tapioca-white, box-sized building\
  \ with an outdoor stage and dusty piano. The audience, a straggle of intrigued locals\
  \ and stray dogs. This was far from a modest arena; this was the Amazon. Tau\xE3\
  \ picked up his saxophone and nodded at me. \u201CThis one\u2019s by Tom Jobim\u201D\
