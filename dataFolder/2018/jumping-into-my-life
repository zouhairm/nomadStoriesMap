Text: "Three years ago, when I was 19, I made a decision that was going to totally\
  \ change my point of view, my beliefs and my entire life. I decided to travel by\
  \ myself to find a connection between what was out of me and what was inside my\
  \ person. In a moment full of confusion, I realized that the way to find myself\
  \ was giving me the opportunity to know what was around me. I opened my eyes. I\
  \ stopped having a close relationship with me, opening to the Unknown. So I bought\
  \ a fly to Costa Rica and, for the very first time in my life, I stopped feeling\
  \ a \"bad fear\" and I started living, facing the Pillars of Hercules I gave myself.\
  \ \nI am from Rome, Italy and the reason why I decided to travel to such a different\
  \ country than mine was that I really wanted to prove myself. Distance cannot be\
  \ an excuse for the lack of knowledge. I wanted to experience a different way of\
  \ living than mine. A culture which is still in a very close connection with Mother\
  \ Nature. I wanted to know more about something which could appear very obvious\
  \ but is not: Simpleness. My eyes were starving, my legs could not feel the tiredness,\
  \ my soul wanted to feel the Pura Vida. \nI can speak a very good spanish so I was\
  \ sure that I would have the opportunity to get some good connections with local\
  \ people to get through the real Country which is so different than the one is showed\
  \ for Tourism. \nOnce I arrived to the airport of San Jose ( which is the Capital\
  \ of Costa Rica) the feeling was so strong that I could not believe I made such\
  \ a big step for me. Everything looked so different compared to the reality I was\
  \ used to. It was my first travelling experience out of Europe's borders and everything\
  \ my eyes stopped on was such a discover: people's faces, Nature, cars, buses, money,\
  \ road signs...The excitement seemed to have gone straight to my head. I felt ready\
  \ to start the experience. I started my trip from San Jose and I have been traveling\
  \ for two months around all the country with a very little bag and with all my Heart.\
  \ I lived so many adventures that It would take me other two months just to tell\
  \ you about them. But I can tell you about one which I think it embodies the most\
  \ important message I got from this experience. I was walking in a city called \"\
  La Fortuna\" when I discovered a river behind a bridge where many people were swimming.\
  \ Just one problem: to get into the water you had to grab a rope, to jump and trust\
  \ yourself. After 20 days of travelling I closed my eyes, I trusted myself and I\
  \ Jumped."
