Text: "On a cold, snowy day in January, I decided to throw caution into the wind and\
  \ fulfill a life long dream. I booked a 4 days/3 nights Inca Trail Trek. My husband\
  \ and I had finally reached our retirement goals and we both agreed we definitely\
  \ did not want to spend our newly found freedom surviving another Canadian winter.\
  \ Now it was official, we would fly into Lima, Peru, travel to Cusco by bus, where\
  \ we would spend 6 days adjusting to the higher altitudes before hiking 48 kms to\
  \ Machu Picchu. \nOn Day 1, we left Cusco and loaded ourselves onto the bus that\
  \ would bring us to our starting point. After travelling several hours by bus and\
  \ getting processed through the admissions Check Point, we were finally on the Inca\
  \ Trail headed to Machu Picchu. We hiked our first 10 km along rocky and uneven\
  \ pathways, witnessing awe inspiring views that literally took our breath away,\
  \ quickly discovering hiking in high altitudes is definitely challenging. When we\
  \ arrived at our base camp, we found our tents pitched, our happy hour snack and\
  \ coca tea. After enjoying an amazing dinner, we retired to our tent, knowing our\
  \ morning would come early.\nOn Day 2, we were awaken by porters who bought us more\
  \ coca tea and warm water to wash away our trail grime. During breakfast our guides\
  \ informed us of our challenging day ahead. 16 km of steep uneven terrain, crossing\
  \ the Dead Woman\u2019s Pass (4215 m) then down a gruelling trail to base camp.\
  \ When we got to camp we were exhausted. We barely managed to eat our dinner before\
  \ collapsing into our tent for a well deserved rest. \nOn Day 3, we trekked another\
  \ 14 km of diverse and often jungle like terrain. We witnessed spectacular views.\
  \ We were the oldest trekkers on the trail and the younger trekkers were constantly\
  \ amazed by our level of speed and endurance. \nOn Day 4, we awoke to clear sunny\
  \ skies and with only 8 km left. Our only challenging obstacle was scaling the Monkey\
  \ Wall. The remainder of the trail that slowly wound itself down to the Sun Gate\
  \ was an easy walk. We will never forget the overwhelming feeling of accomplishment\
  \ that we both shared when we finally reached the Sun Gate. As we looked past the\
  \ Sun Gate, our physical pain instantly melted away in the warm September sun that\
  \ was glistening over the Forgotten City of Machu Picchu. After 3 cold nights in\
  \ a damp tent and after hiking 48 long kms, very often only twenty careful steps\
  \ at a time, stopping only to catch a breath of thin mountain air, we accomplished\
  \ our goal. We did it!"
