Text: "The train is reaching Sion, Switzerland. We have the routine problem we grapple\
  \ with before we reach a new city: How to reach the address of our hostel? As the\
  \ train is approaching the station, we came near the exit door. Adarsh, my friend,\
  \ warranted to find out the address from a lanky swiss guy who is at the door. He\
  \ looked 30 years old and about 6\u20191 tall. He in turn asked us if we are from\
  \ India and we replied in affirmative. He told us that he came to India the previous\
  \ year, wished us with \u201CNamaste\u201D and kept on repeating \u201CChicken Tikka!\
  \ Really tasty\u201D. When we enquired him about the address to Sion Youth Hostel,\
  \ he murmured that he does not know and attended his phone call in french. We made\
  \ fun of Adarsh for choosing a drunk guy to find address. \n\nWe started towards\
  \ exit after coming out of train. Another friend, Sasank, distrusts the lockers\
  \ in the train station and keeps lugging around a huge trolley filled to the brim.\
  \ In few minutes, the drunk guy, while still on phone, came back to find us and\
  \ waved us to follow him. Though surprised, we obliged. When we came out of the\
  \ station, we find that the person he is conversing on phone is his girlfriend who\
  \ is waiting in a blue Audi A3 car. He quickly opens the trunk and puts our luggage\
  \ in the car. Along with us, even his girl friend is bewildered. He tries to put\
  \ the trolley of Sasank in the trunk but alas it does not fit. He pulls out the\
  \ audio plank to make room for trolley and signals us to sit in the car. We manage\
  \ to fit into the rear seat while he sits in the passenger seat holding the audio\
  \ plank vertically. His girlfriend is still confused at the uninvited guests.\n\n\
  He gives her instructions in French and she revvs the engine. She is driving at\
  \ more than hundred and we are holding onto the front seat to maintain balance during\
  \ speed jerks. After ten minutes, we notice that we are passing through the same\
  \ road twice. Then we understood that they offered to help us even when they did\
  \ not know address. While we are passing through the road for the third time, we\
  \ spotted our youth hostel through the logo and signalled them to stop. She brings\
  \ the car to a quick stop.\n\nOur superman comes out of the car first and carefully\
  \ pulls out our luggage including the trolley. Even before we could thank him, he\
  \ folds his hands and bows to us with a \u201CNamaste\u201D. He kept repeating \u201C\
  Chicken Tikka! Very tasty\u201D. \n\nWe silently thanked the Indian cook who left\
  \ a lasting impression with his \u201CChicken Tikka\u201D."
