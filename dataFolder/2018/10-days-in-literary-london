Text: "I landed at Heathrow and anticipated immersing myself in London\u2019s culture,\
  \ but unfortunately, I only had 10 days. While I was familiar with London through\
  \ literature, I did not know the city intimately\u2014its fumes, its people, or\
  \ the tube. I had to experience it for myself. Once on the train, my friend whispered,\
  \ \u201CLook to your right.\u201D A woman wore kitten-heeled boots and all black\
  \ except for a green cape. The man beside her watched, enamored. Later, I bought\
  \ a green cape. We got off at Notting Hill and wondered who lives in the ivory-white\
  \ buildings and whether they are posh or bohemian. \u201CLet\u2019s live here someday,\u201D\
  \ my friend said. We loved London because it was there that we met romantic versions\
  \ of ourselves, whether the historian, artist, or writer. \nWhile I didn\u2019t\
  \ think I traveled to England to find myself, when we went to Oxford, the city stirred\
  \ my imagination and inspired me to write. We had lunch at The Eagle and Child pub.\
  \ I envisioned the Inklings hunched over their drinks, laughing and writing. A mounted\
  \ C.S. Lewis quote read, \u201CMy happiest hours are spent with three or four old\
  \ friends in old clothes, tramping together and putting up in small pubs,\u201D\
  \ and we spent our hours as Lewis had, notebook in hand. We watched taxi cabs and\
  \ bikes dart across the cobblestone streets, splashing puddles. My friend, plugging\
  \ in earbuds, said, \u201CThere\u2019s something about listening to music when walking\
  \ through a city like Oxford,\u201D and I contemplated that we turn to music as\
  \ we do stories. These art forms communicate who we are, our desires, and how we\
  \ see the world. It is as if someone had taken a stethoscope and listened to our\
  \ heartbeat. Remembering the stories that touched me, I pulled out my notebook and\
  \ wrote. When we returned to London and visited Westminster Abbey, I read writers\u2019\
  \ names etched in stone and hoped to write a story that would inspire someone as\
  \ their stories inspired me. I wrote down the Bront\xEBs\u2019s epitaph\u2014With\
  \ Courage to Endure\u2014a dedication to their lives and an encouragement for mine.\
  \ \nOn our last day in London, we sat in a pew at The Royal Military Chapel and\
  \ recalled how we fell in love with the city. We listened to the reverend repeat\
  \ the words of Ana\xEFs Nin: \u201CWe don\u2019t see people as they are, we see\
  \ people as we are.\u201D Only then I realized it had shown me in its people and\
  \ places my heart\u2019s hidden hopes and dreams. With its thick fog and darting\
  \ taxi cabs, rich history and literary influences, London invited me to write."
