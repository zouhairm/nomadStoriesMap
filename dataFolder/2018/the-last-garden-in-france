Text: "I never imagined gardening could produce such passion, fervor, and urgency.\
  \ Then I moved to Montlu\xE7on and next door to Monsieur C, a man who speaks exclusively\
  \ in exclamation points, wears overalls and a sun hat, and jabs his finger at you\
  \ when he speaks\u2013and he's usually talking about his garden. \n\nFor a week\
  \ he had beseeched me, in his apocalyptic way, to come visit his backyard, \"the\
  \ last true garden in all of France.\" \n\n\"You must see it! Before it's too late!\"\
  \n\nIn early spring, the yard burst into white-bloomed glory. I could appreciate\
  \ the view from my kitchen window, but Monsieur C wouldn't relent. I followed him\
  \ to the garden. \n\nHe showed me the white cherry tree that produced delicious\
  \ fruit\u2013and was crawling with bugs. \"C'est pas grave,\" he assured me: \"\
  when you eat it, just close your eyes!\"\n\nHe bemoaned the plucky little birds\
  \ that peck at his asparagus, and he revealed the leeks, hidden under a screen to\
  \ keep flies away. \"This way,\" he said, \"I can enjoy them longer than anyone\
  \ else! Aha!\"\n\nHe spoke often of his superior methods. I didn't have to wonder\
  \ if the neighborhood rivalry ever got ugly: I already knew. The cheery white cherry\
  \ tree was enough of a reminder never to underestimate Monsieur C. \n\nHe was giving\
  \ me a ride in his sputtering Citro\xEBn when he slammed on the brakes in front\
  \ of a house several blocks from our street.\n\n\"See that cherry tree?\" Finger\
  \ jab. \"That is a good-looking cherry tree,\" he said. I agreed. He then told me\
  \ a story. He had once asked the gardener to let him have a branch; start his own\
  \ cherry tree. The man refused. \"I offered to pay him,\" Monsieur C said, \"and\
  \ he wouldn\u2019t take my money!\" \n\nOne late night, he crept through the fence,\
  \ snipped a branch from the tree, and roared off.\n\nAn older widower as traditional\
  \ as Norman Camembert, Monsieur C was set in his ways. His ways were the best! But\
  \ hidden behind the ornery exterior was a sweetness. \n\nI'd see it when he would\
  \ knock on my door, offering a couple of ripe clementines or a boxed \xE9clair.\
  \ He had a budding friendship with a crow. His face lit up when he told me how \"\
  Coco\" had swept away the bread he'd left for her on the patio. The cats that assembled,\
  \ eager for scraps, weren't treated as kindly. Oh! He'd yell, hitting a pot with\
  \ a spoon. \n\nMy French neighbor presented his garden like a proud parent. And\
  \ he was proud: of his land, his home, his cherry tree. I don't know about the last\
  \ true garden in all of France. But I think I met one of its last true gardeners."
