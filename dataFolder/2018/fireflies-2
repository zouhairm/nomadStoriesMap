Text: "Nicaragua made me believe in magic.\n\nSam and I flew in on a whim - we knew\
  \ very little of the country, but we were ready for an adventure. We booked our\
  \ hostel for the first night, then played it by ear. We chatted up folks and asked\
  \ - where do we go next?\n\n\u201CYou have to go to Ometepe. There\u2019s nowhere\
  \ like it.\u201D\n\nAfter days partying on the Pacific coast, we set off for Isla\
  \ Ometepe - a massive island sprung from two volcanoes, resting in the centre of\
  \ Lake Nicaragua. Following a chaotic boat and cab ride, we found ourselves at a\
  \ hostel in the rainforest. We admired baby pigs in the garden, before heading out\
  \ for lunch.\n\nWe walked out to the road and a handsome, smiling man waved us over.\n\
  \n\u201COla ladies! Would you like some information, food, free wifi?\u201D\n\n\
  He pointed at a sign that literally read \u201CINFORMATION, FOOD, FREE WIFI.\u201D\
  \ Dear God, yes.\n\nFernando introduced himself and sat us in his roadside restaurant,\
  \ a tree hut covered with neon signs. We ate pineapple and he told us he offers\
  \ tours of the island. We loved it. The next morning, he picked us up in his red\
  \ jeep.\n\nWe spent the day swimming in crystal spring waters, sipping coconuts\
  \ filled with rum, and strolling through butterfly gardens. Fernando brought us\
  \ back for dinner and asked if we were going to party at Little Morgan\u2019s that\
  \ night.\n\nParty? Yes please.\n\nFinding it was yet another adventure. We walked\
  \ down the road in pitch black, navigating with our phone lights, stumbling towards\
  \ the sounds of the music. Eventually, we found Little Morgan\u2019s - a hostel\
  \ alive with laughter and dancing. \n\nWe sipped rum on hammocks, talked about life\
  \ and shared our snacks with a stray cat. Sam left for a moment and came back beaming.\n\
  \n\u201CDude, follow me.\u201D\n\nShe lead me to the beach. We sat on a rock above\
  \ the shore, our toes nestled into the sand. Looking out, all we could see were\
  \ stars in the sky and fireflies in the grass. In the blackness, with the endless\
  \ lake ahead of us, the sand became the water, and the water became the sky. The\
  \ fireflies and stars shimmered the same.\n\nMusic echoed in the distance from the\
  \ bar to the beach, melting with rhythmically crashing waves. \n\nWe sat together\
  \ in silence.\n\n\u201CThis is perfect.\u201D\n\nThis moment came from one thing\
  \ - following our intuition. There was no amount of planning that could have led\
  \ us here. It only happened because we trusted each other, other people, and ourselves.\n\
  \nThat night on Isla Ometepe was the most beautiful one of my life.\n\nMagic is\
  \ real. It exists in Nicaragua."
