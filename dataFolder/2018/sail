Text: "I met Geoff Mandel the summer while I was working in the wilderness of Algonquin\
  \ Park as a canoe tripper. We went on a 15 day trip through lakes and rivers and\
  \ got to know each other very well.\nThis all brings me to the evening of the 25th\
  \ of September. After unloading the last leftover beers from our half day long farewell\
  \ BBQ in a friend\u2019s backyard, we were tipsy enough to think it would be a great\
  \ idea to sail through the night. It might add to the experience of the reader to\
  \ mention at this point that I had no previous sailing experience.\nNight came faster\
  \ than expected. The sway of a small boat on the waves of lake of the size of Lake\
  \ Ontario is somewhat like that feeling of relaxation and absence you get when you\
  \ go underwater.\nWe knew for sure, after consulting some paper charts that there\
  \ was a rock point somewhere 5 km off the shore of Port Granby, but It is very hard\
  \ to establish a distance with only light in a dark night as a reference. I spied\
  \ a flare like reddish intermittent signal in the distance.\nWe fixed our eyes on\
  \ it and started counting seconds, 2 seconds going up then going down for another\
  \ 13, then extinguishing for 30 and repeating this sequence endlessly.\nAbout half\
  \ an hour later, we were caught in mid dinner by the most deafening sound of a horn\
  \ I had ever heard. We figured out quite quickly that that light was no buoy, or\
  \ no emergency call for help, it was the top mast of a 30 ton freighter on its nightly\
  \ cross through the lake! And we were heading on a 24 foot sailboat on dead wind\
  \ straight towards it. This is not good.\nScurrying like rats in a fire we tied\
  \ and untied ropes and turned the rudder to turn us on a 90\u030A angle, dropped\
  \ the gas motor and prayed it would get us far enough from the jaws of the freighter\
  \ in time. Fortunately, it passed us about 150 meters away.\nAs we watched the great\
  \ ships lights go by smoothly, an uneasy feeling of sudden calm waters struck us\
  \ from below, and out of nowhere, I heard Geoff yell \u201CWAKE!\u201D \nIt hit\
  \ us with full force on the side, knocking the only light we had to the depths and\
  \ dipping the boat in its side to the point of water gushing in. If we weren\u2019\
  t on a keel boat we would have tipped and sunk. \nWe went on land and, as good Canadians\
  \ do, headed to the nearest Tim Horton\u2019s (which was right around the corner),\
  \ we each had a breakfast bagel, a maple glazed doughnut and a medium double double\
  \ and sat in silence in one of the booths. We couldn\u2019t believe we were alive!"
