Text: "With a swift strike of his machete, the gnarled branch that had been obstructing\
  \ our path falls to the ground. He carries on and I follow.\n\nWith each step, I\
  \ must use extra effort to pry my feet free from the path, muddy from last night\u2019\
  s rain. The sound of each step is like the final slurp of a milkshake, as you try\
  \ to suck up every last drop.\n \nOh, how I could go for a milkshake. Or just a\
  \ sip of icy water instead of the bottle in my backpack that\u2019s growing increasingly\
  \ warm in this tropical heat.\n\nI pause as the machete is used once again to clear\
  \ the jungle\u2019s wild mane. A trimmer to a beard. We walk on, my shoulders damp\
  \ with sweat and humidity and more sweat.\n\nI lift my gaze and realize with a feeling\
  \ of dread that the path is about to get much, much steeper.\n\nMaybe a hike wasn\u2019\
  t the best idea. Perhaps I should have had a beach day instead.\n\nThis tiny island\
  \ in the Caribbean Sea is barely visible on Google Maps. And even when you\u2019\
  re zoomed in as far as you can go, the map can\u2019t tell you much about Providence\
  \ Island. And neither can the rest of the Internet, for that matter.\n\n\u201CWe\u2019\
  s almost there,\u201D Orlis mumbles. And then, as if warning the forest creatures,\
  \ he belts out a cry at the top of his lungs and waits for the jungle to return\
  \ his melody. He nods, satisfied, and up we climb.\n\nEventually we reach a clearing\
  \ and strong gusts of wind are a welcomed relief, chilling my sweat-soaked clothes.\n\
  \nOrlis motions me to sit down, and he joins on the adjacent rock. \"My special\
  \ place,\u201D he smiles proudly. \u201CMeditation rock.\u201D\n\nI nod, \u201C\
  Beautiful.\u201D And I mean it. Turquoise waters meet the sky, and palms sway fiercely\
  \ in the breeze.\n\n\u201CToday I\u2019m happy,\u201D Orlis smiles only for a moment,\
  \ but it\u2019s enough to reveal a mouth full of teeth, shockingly white against\
  \ his rich skin.\n\nI cock my head to the side, prompting him to go on.\n\n\u201C\
  Many days now I don\u2019t have work. The tourists, they want to hike alone. They\
  \ think they don\u2019t need me. But they get lost. And they don\u2019t know this\
  \ place like I do. This is my home. I can tell the stories and secrets that live\
  \ here.\u201D\n\nThe smile returns to his face, \u201CBut today, you give me work.\u201D\
  \n\nHe touches my shoulder where sweat has dried in a salty crust, \u201CToday,\
  \ I am happy.\u201D I smile and blood rushes to my cheeks. I suddenly feel warm,\
  \ though my arms betray me as goosebumps slowly cover them like a football stadium\
  \ standing in a choreographed \u201Cwave\u201D.\n\nOrlis looks away, but as he faces\
  \ the ocean I can see the corners of his mouth turn upward."
