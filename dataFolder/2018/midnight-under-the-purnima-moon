Text: "Dusk fell, bringing with it a soft breeze from the mountains. I awoke to the\
  \ touch of a hand on my shoulder, wrenching me out of blissful slumber and into\
  \ the uncertainty of the night. Wiping the residue of sleep from my eyes I slipped\
  \ on my walking shoes, hugged my thick yak wool shawl about me tightly, and stepped\
  \ out into the dark. \nBy the glow of candlelight I was escorted high above the\
  \ village, across silver veins of water still warm from the midday sun, through\
  \ the dense undergrowth rife with leeches and along dusty makeshift pathways.\n\
  The air hung thick about me and I could hear a faint buzz in the distance that seemed\
  \ to grow in intensity with every step. We turned a corner and instantly the hairs\
  \ on my arms stood to attention.\nA clearing in the trees revealed the most magnificent\
  \ temple; built around two immense, twisted Peeple trees. As we neared it, almost\
  \ indescribably, it seemed to exude ecstasy itself; a throbbing of life achieved\
  \ when the masses have gravitated here, past and present, old and young, in search\
  \ of a common purpose, I couldn\u2019t help but think what this temple had seen\
  \ as it sat here aged and mystical on its lofty perch.  \nAround it, in the splendour\
  \ of the bonfire a group of women sang, the throaty, undulating tones of their voices\
  \ rising and falling in rhythmic simplicity into the night. About them children\
  \ danced barefooted; their foreheads aglow with the flaming stains of red rice tikas\
  \ and unfading smiles blooming on their ruddy cheeks.\nBefore I knew it I was in\
  \ the heart of the temple, on my knees in the crimson dirt and gazing up into the\
  \ eyes of an elderly woman. She had a face as delicate as bone China, with heavy\
  \ gold rings hanging from her ears and nose and framed by a mass of ebony hair which\
  \ shone silver in the glimmer of the fire. With a brush of her fingers she adorned\
  \ my forehead with a brilliant red tika, and, murmuring softly under her breath,\
  \ swept a cluster of fresh wheatgrass and fragrant marigolds behind my ear in a\
  \ blessing. Her gentle face arched gracefully as she offered me a reassuring smile;\
  \ she spoke no English and I very little Nepali, but in that moment I felt understood.\n\
  Leading me outside to the comfort of the fire, we danced to the beat of echoing\
  \ drums; all the while watched over by the Purnima moon, its milky light casting\
  \ an evanescent glow about the hills, the temple and our uplifted faces as we danced;\
  \ our unsuppressed laughter seemingly warming my soul as the crackling fire warmed\
  \ my bones."
