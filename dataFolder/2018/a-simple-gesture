Text: "Everyone warned me; don't come here. My expectations are rapidly disjointed\
  \ as we drive through the ruins of a dilapidated city.  I had recited it so many\
  \ times; assured everyone I was well-aware of the unfavorable views of westerners,\
  \ and that, if anything, political turmoil heightens security and deflates prices.\
  \  I catch the drivers eyes on me from the rear view mirror, and the ash from the\
  \ cigarette he juggles between his lips. I realize my foolishness in not copying\
  \ down the address of the Riad in Arabic. He alternates between yelling at the people\
  \ and donkeys crossing our path and whomever is on the other end of the flip phone\
  \ balancing on his ear. Through the window I can smell the distinct smell of the\
  \ city; a combination of sulfur and livestock.  Men with hunched backs, deformed\
  \ limbs and missing teeth push carts with the freshly skinned and decapitated corpses\
  \ of animals. They look at me as if I can\u2019t see them looking back, with a mixture\
  \ of curiosity and contempt, but one thing becomes lucidly clear; I am somewhere\
  \ I don't belong, and likely am unwanted. Being a woman in this part of the world\
  \ is bad enough. Being a woman unaccompanied by a man is worst.  But being a woman\
  \ with light features is probably the worst possible aesthetic, especially in this\
  \ political climate. Despite the dry desert heat, I zip up my jacket and pull my\
  \ hood to cover my hair.  We come to a sharp stop in the middle of the road, he\
  \ tells me we\u2019ve arrived. Through a thick language barrier I ask for change\
  \ and he disappears into the chaos of the crowd.  The call to prayer begins, and\
  \ I\u2019ve never felt like such an intruder.  A man stands about 20 feet away,\
  \ eyes fixated on me. He begins to approach, and I hope I'm misreading the situation.\
  \ I feel the fear rising in my gut, all the warnings and not so subtle implications\
  \ coming to light.  I am at the mercy of stranger's intentions.  He knocks on the\
  \ door and I pretend not to notice.  My hands tremble as I cling tightly to my purse,\
  \ and I feel the weight of tears building in my eyes.  \"I'm Mohammad, I work at\
  \ the Riad. The driver called to say you were on you way.  May I?\" he gestures\
  \ to the door.  It takes a deliberate effort to suspend my skepticism, but something\
  \ in his voice prompts me to do so.  I raise my gaze to meet his.  \"Why do you\
  \ cry?\" he asks, and pauses before delicately raising a hand to wipe my tear. \
  \ I've never had anyone do such an intimate thing, especially not a stranger.  \
  \ It was the last thing I expected."
