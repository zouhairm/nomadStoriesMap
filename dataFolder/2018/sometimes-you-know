Text: "Sipping a cup of coffee on a Sunday afternoon having these  gushing feelings\
  \ of guilt like oh my father is an established lawyer I need to be his shadow take\
  \ over the  Law firm. \n\nStaring at the birds chirping out impulsed a thought what\
  \ if I could give up  law, what if I could take a chance to be with myself and wonder\
  \ who really am I ? But again I resisted the thought of doing what I really want\
  \ because the strong belief of being responsible for my parent\u2019s happniness\
  \ haunted my mind for a days, weeks and months together. \n\nThis time I knew that\
  \ the impulse wasn\u2019t temporary. The next day I met a couple of my friends and\
  \ discussed my discomfort regarding my aversion to my career in Law. Well some supported\
  \ my feelings and others didn\u2019t. Then Ineas questioned what would you do if\
  \ not Law. I had a question mark on my head and wondered what am I really good at\
  \ and the first thought came to my head well a bit of writing and a lot of traveling.\n\
  \nOver the past few days I had listed out my career options like travel journalism,\
  \ avertising, marketing, psychology or may be IPR Law. When I expressed my feelings\
  \ for my love and passion for a travel journalism all I was told who will pay for\
  \ your travel? Is there enough money ? All these questions seemed to bizzare and\
  \ useless to me that I was infuriated not to express my dreams and goals with anyone.\
  \ \n\nI just thought to myself that this feeling for travel is  deep rooted because\
  \ I  have been traveling the world since the age of 9 and that was the feeling that\
  \ just didn\u2019t leave even once. The feeling of a new place, new people, the\
  \ street food, the smell of every place that I visited. Everytime I visited a new\
  \ place it seemed as thought I had a connection and all I did was speak to that\
  \ my saying that I loved you soo much please call me again !! I know sounds crazy\
  \ but that\u2019s how so I feel about travelling!! \n\nSo I know that I have to\
  \ make a career out of travel...how I don\u2019t know !! I am for sure this time\
  \ going to do what seems in alignment with my passion !! This seems to be of the\
  \ may opportunities that is standing along my way !! I don\u2019t to be associated\
  \ to a particular place or work or religion I just want to experience different\
  \ places in the joyest way I can and take the best that leaves me with a smile on\
  \ my face everyday  and realise this is what I have signed for. \n\nHow wonderful\
  \ will it be to experience life everyday differently, live a life of someone else\
  \ and be somebody else everyday. Just Imagine !!"
