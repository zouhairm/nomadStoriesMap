Text: "I\u2019m standing in an airport surrounded by people smoking and I\u2019m starting\
  \ to question why on earth I came to Egypt. I\u2019m well and truly out of my comfort\
  \ zone. I approach a man who\u2019s holding a board with my name on it, he is here\
  \ to save me from Cairo Airport. And after collecting my bags from a carousel overflowing\
  \ with bags sitting at wrong angles, I\u2019m whisked away from the chaos. I ask\
  \ how long it\u2019ll take to get to the hotel, 3 hours is his reply. It\u2019s\
  \ 5pm, which means we won\u2019t get to the hotel until 8pm. My international roaming\
  \ isn\u2019t working, so I can\u2019t call my family to let them know I have arrived\
  \ safely. It\u2019s peak hour in Cairo. Which means the roads look more like a carpark,\
  \ than that of a road. I pass the time and chat with my driver Siede, about his\
  \ life in Cairo, his wife and three children. When we finally arrive at the hotel,\
  \ there are no goodbyes with my airport saviour. He hurriedly takes my bags to the\
  \ concierge before disappearing to either save another soul at the airport, or to\
  \ head home to his family. I will never know. With my phone still not working, I\
  \ speak with front desk on where to get one, they provide me with a map and directions\
  \ to get to a Vodafone store. With my map in hand and no form of communication I\
  \ start walking in what I hope is the right direction to Vodafone. I\u2019ll be\
  \ honest, I am incredibly nervous to be walking the streets of Cairo at night and\
  \ 10 minutes still no sight of Vodafone. I stop and examine my map and a man in\
  \ his 40s approaches me. He knows I am lost and politely asks if I am okay. I am\
  \ cautious in telling him I am looking for Vodafone, \u201CAh yes, you follow me,\
  \ I will take you there. Not far.\u201D He says. I hear nothing, but my own heat\
  \ beat as I focus on what he\u2019s saying. He\u2019s asking me to follow him. But\
  \ will he take me to Vodafone, or somewhere else. I try not to judge, but I need\
  \ to be careful. I agree to follow and off we go. I take stock of my surroundings\
  \ as we walk. Searching for anything suspicious in the crowd. We walk for another\
  \ 10 minutes, when I finally see the bright red neon lights of a Vodafone shop up\
  \ ahead. I am conflicted in this moment of realisation, where part of me wants to\
  \ be praised for being a cautious traveller, and the other part of me should be\
  \ scolded for being so judgemental. The kindness and warmth I go on to experience\
  \ from all the Egyptian locals, for the rest of my Egyptian holiday was the last\
  \ thing I expected to experience there, and one that will forever be in my heart."
