Text: "Walking a dusty, olive-and-orange-tree-ridden path in my over-worn trainers,\
  \ I made my way past terracotta Berber houses when it hit me; a pungent scent of\
  \ roses - I had arrived to the Festival des Roses or the Festival of Roses with\
  \ a colossal amount of pink Persian roses growing from hedgerows all over the land.\
  \ I loved the town of Kela\xE2t M\u2019Gouna in Morocco even though I\u2019d only\
  \ been here for a day - the warm sun that aggressively kissed my body, the hot and\
  \ flavoursome mint tea that I drank the night before, the perfectly imperfect Atlas\
  \ Mountains that surround the area and the locals\u2019 appreciation for life and\
  \ nature especially in the form of the bonny pink blooms, had immediately won over\
  \ my heart.\n\nThe walk to the valley however, was a thirsty one. I needed to replenish\
  \ my fluids quickly as that warm Moroccan sun I spoke about previously was becoming\
  \ a vigorous little monster. In the distance, I spotted an elderly man selling rose\
  \ tea out of a bright orange stall - he was short and frail but had a presence that\
  \ exuded joy and merriment, conversing with everyone that passed by even when they\
  \ weren't buying from him. As I approached him, clutching my 5 Moroccan Dirhams\
  \ in my hand, I was greeted with a smile. His name was J\xE9r\xF4me Mansouri Khouya\
  \ and he was a local 81-year-old who grew up and stayed in Kela\xE2t M\u2019Gouna\
  \ yet he held a worldly wisdom and knowledge aura with him. J\xE9r\xF4me had taught\
  \ himself basic English through visits from his children who stayed in Marrakesh\
  \ for work and was adamant that the English language was one from the Gods despite\
  \ the melodic chimes of French and Arabic fluttering around. \n\nMy quick rose tea\
  \ hydration session had turned into a life-changing experience. J\xE9r\xF4me, in\
  \ his thick Moroccan accent, explained that although he hasn't got much financially\
  \ or materialistically, he is rich. Rich in humour and in love, in passion and in\
  \ appetite. That his simple life of selling rose tea to tourists was fulfilling\
  \ because he was providing these people with something that wasn't just a drink\
  \ - it was a liquid so affluent in culture and history that he felt honoured to\
  \ have the job as his duty. \n\nAs I took my last sip of tea, I thanked J\xE9r\xF4\
  me. His words were the rose within my life of thorns; a call to action to find my\
  \ passion and to live it. To celebrate life and love, to smile and laugh even when\
  \ times are tough and to always find time for a lovely cup of tea and lastly, to\
  \ look at the world through rose-tinted coloured glasses."
