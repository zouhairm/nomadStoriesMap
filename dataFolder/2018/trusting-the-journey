Text: "\u201CI can take you surfing! Horse-back riding! Paddle boarding!\u201D I was\
  \ lying on a beach in Mexico when a local tour guide came along. My intention had\
  \ been to spend all day in the sun with the occasional dip in the sea but his passion\
  \ for his tours sparked my sense of adventure.\nI almost didn\u2019t have the heart\
  \ to reply, \u201CI\u2019m only here for the day.\u201D\n\u201CThe day? You can\u2019\
  t see all of Vallarta in a day!\u201D\n\u201CI know\u2026\u201D\n\u201CTell you\
  \ what, I\u2019ll take you to a waterfall you have to see.\u201D\n\u201CHow much?\u201D\
  \ I asked, a little skeptical but inspired by my spontaneous weekend in Mexico he\
  \ said my company was enough.\n\u201CCan I trust you?\u201D I asked the local.\n\
  \u201CYes,\u201D he said, smiling and I believed him.\nI am aware of being a solo\
  \ traveller and a single girl but I\u2019m just not willing to live my life in fear.\
  \ Sometimes you have to take a leap of faith. Had I not, I would have missed out\
  \ on an incredible experience.\nFirst Pedro, as I learned his name was, took me\
  \ on a driving tour of Puerto Vallarta. Once we got away from the fancy hotels,\
  \ the city was absolutely vibrating with energy. Music came from all directions,\
  \ colourful flags connected narrow alleys of markets and aromatic smells of taco\
  \ spice and church incense wafted through the open windows of the truck as we bumped\
  \ down the cobblestones\u2014a \"Mexican massage,\" Pedro called it.\nWe drove until\
  \ we reached an unmarked river where we parked. He led the way, taking me along\
  \ a jungle path lined with vines, wild orchids, coconuts and \u201Cgringo trees\u201D\
  \u2014a type of tree that turns red and peels in the sun, a bit like\u2026a foreigner!\n\
  Using rocks as stepping-stones, he guided me up a river that belonged to another\
  \ world. Only the trickle of water, a soft breeze and call of tropical birds could\
  \ be heard. After a half hour of hiking, the jungle canopy opened up and we stood\
  \ at the foot of this amazing turquoise pool fed by a waterfall. Butterflies of\
  \ every size and colour flew so close I reached out and one brushed my fingertips.\n\
  Not-so-little fish swam in the water but not to be intimidated, I intended to wade\
  \ in until Pedro pointed to the rock cliffs bordering the pool. Finding my courage,\
  \ I used vines to climb the stone cliffs and without hesitation jumped! \nWe finished\
  \ the day with a spectacular sunset on a private beach watching pelicans dive for\
  \ fish. Far off to the right was the Puerto Vallarta most tourists only see. Had\
  \ I not trusted myself, trusted Pedro and trusted the journey, I might have been\
  \ one of them instead of living in the moment."
