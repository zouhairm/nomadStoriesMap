Text: "I squirmed lazily to avoid the piercing light. \n\n\u201CDobre Utro!\u201D\
  \ An infuriatingly cheery voice boomed.\n\nI had left Yekatrinburg late the previous\
  \ night and, despite being a poor sleeper, had managed to drift off for a few hours.\
  \ My aching teenage bones, lulled to slumber by the motion of the carriage, would\
  \ not stir, even as my eyes squinted to focus on my surroundings.\n\n\u201CKak tebya\
  \ zavut?\u201D beamed the man who looked like a Soviet Alf Garnett, as the sun shone\
  \ off his bald scalp like varnished wood.\n\n\u201CHuh? Err..\u201D\n\n\u201CMenya\
  \ zavut Maksim.\u201D He bellowed, slowly, whilst placing a hand on his chest.\n\
  \n\u201CM-m-menya zavut Artur. Ya Angelichanin.\u201D I blurted, before remembering\
  \ to add, \u201CNye pa Russki.\u201D I had hoped that this fact, confirmed by my\
  \ poor grasp of sentence structure, would put paid to the man's attempts to converse\
  \ with me.\n\n\u201COh, Eengleesh! Margaret Thatcher! Very good!\u201D \n\nI winced,\
  \ groggily, as I finally admitted to myself that I would not be going back to sleep\
  \ any time soon.\n\nMaksim seemed delighted to have met a real, live foreigner.\
  \ He did not let our lack of a shared language derail his intention to tell me his\
  \ life story. From his constant repetition and flamboyant use of gestures, I gathered\
  \ that he was an opera singer, was 64 years old and on his way to Khabarovsk to\
  \ visit his mother.\n\nAs I sat up and began to stretch, Maksim produced a chess\
  \ board. This was the first time I had seen anyone do this in Russia, despite having\
  \ been brought up on the belief that this was the national pastime.\n\nI had not\
  \ played chess in almost a decade, my only experience of it having been with my\
  \ father, in the days before we had a computer. Despite my reluctance, I agreed\
  \ to play Maksim \u2013 after all, what else was I going to do for the next fifty\
  \ hours?\n\nInitially, Maksim would suggest moves for me by gesticulating where\
  \ to place whichever knight or pawn, but after a while I realised that every game\
  \ followed the same pattern \u2013 with him winning. I decided to mix things up\
  \ a bit by breaking out my queen early and terrorising the ranks of his nobles,\
  \ before she was promptly despatched with. I still lost the game, but it was worth\
  \ it, if only to see the look on his face. A few attempts later, we reached a stalemate.\n\
  \nFrozen forests hurtled by. We clattered and thudded over hulking steel bridges,\
  \ spanning mighty rivers, as solid and still as alabaster. Was that the Irtysh beneath\
  \ us, or the Ob? Maksim's stare remained fixed on the chess board. Was this the\
  \ price of silence?"
