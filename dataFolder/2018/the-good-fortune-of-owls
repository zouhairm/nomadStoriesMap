Text: "A wooden sign points me away from the busy road. Stepping onto a narrow driveway,\
  \ I walk downhill towards a small house set amongst a sea of rice fields. The air\
  \ is thick with humidity and the scent of tropical flowers. Sweat sticks to every\
  \ inch of my body, as it longs for the relief of a mythical cool breeze that does\
  \ not exist in Bali. The chaotic vibration of motorized scooters and street markets\
  \ is fading, while the orchestra of monkeys, birds and insects is amplifying. A\
  \ faint, twangy, high pitched jingle also floats through the air, growing louder\
  \ with each passing breath. \n\nI look up to see two black dogs, their tails wagging\
  \ with vigorous invitation. On each of their collars, glinting in the sun, is a\
  \ tiny bell shaped like an owl.\n\nLike hosts at a fancy restaurant, the dogs lead\
  \ me towards the door of the home. A Japanese man welcomes me warmly as I enter\
  \ into a small, meticulously organized art gallery. I oddly have the sense that\
  \ I am being watched. Looking around, I register the wise eyes of owls perched in\
  \ each piece of art. \n\nI curiously ask the man, \"Why owls?\" \n\nHe smiles warmly,\
  \ while absentmindedly petting one of the dogs. \"In Japan, the presence of an owl\
  \ welcomes good fortune. When I started turning owls into art, abundance was blessed\
  \ upon my life. I wanted to share that good fortune with others.\" \n\nMy face softens\
  \ in appreciation of his beautiful response. I begin to wander through the small\
  \ gallery, wooden floor boards creaking below me. The dogs get my attention, leading\
  \ me towards the jewelry, as though they intuitively know of my weak spot for collecting\
  \ accessories in foreign lands. My eyes fall on a sphere shaped pendant that reminds\
  \ me of a round bullet. It's gold is worn, distressed with the scars of a story\
  \ that I will never know. Molded on top of the sphere is a shiny gold owl, with\
  \ tiny facial features etched in it's smooth new metal. I admire it's unique contrast\
  \ as I roll it around in my palm. \n\n\"No good fortune ever comes without a few\
  \ battle scars,\" says the man, nodding towards the pendant.\n\nTaking it from my\
  \ hand, he shakes it gently. Once again, the twangy, high pitched jingle fills the\
  \ air.\n\nMonths later, I come in from the cold, met by the warm welcome of my own\
  \ dogs. As I untie my boots, my necklace swings forward, creating that familiar\
  \ jingle. I drift back to humidity and wise words. Life is not without it's bullets\
  \ or bruises, but it is the art of seeing beauty in our scars that welcomes in the\
  \ good fortune."
