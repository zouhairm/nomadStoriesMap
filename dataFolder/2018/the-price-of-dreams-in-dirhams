Text: "I knocked at the hostel\u2019s door, a small old brown door embedded in a reddish\
  \ orange wall situated in a tight street in the old town of Marrakesh. The hostel\u2019\
  s owner opened it and after the check-in, offered me a glass of mint tea explaining\
  \ that it is a typical drink in Morocco. \n\nAfter I finished unpacking, I went\
  \ out to explore the city! It was four o\u2019clock in the afternoon and it was\
  \ 42 degrees. It wasn\u2019t just hot, it was the kind of sultry heat that would\
  \ dry my throat and heat the cold water in my water bottle, bought 15 minutes before.\
  \ As I strolled through the tight streets, I heard a rhythmic sound. I broke through\
  \ the people standing in front of a group of musicians that were playing. Their\
  \ soft voices mixed together with a sound that I had never heard before, which involved\
  \ everybody in a delightful atmosphere. A rectangular shaped metal instrument with\
  \ a rounded surface on both sides retained my attention! The girl standing next\
  \ to me asked me if I was enjoying the music, noticing my curiosity about it. I\
  \ answered affirmatively, and kindly she explained: \n\n- \u201CThis is Gnawa music.\
  \ It was originally created by black slaves. When they were wearing leg's shackles\
  \ they would make that sound while they walked. When slavery ended they turned the\
  \ shackles into musical instruments: they call them krakeb\u201D.\n\n- \u201CI would\
  \ never imagine that! The sound goes very well with the other instruments.\u201D\
  \ \u2013 I answered.\n\n- \u201CI totally agree! It\u2019s the proof that we can\
  \ turn a bad thing into a good one. \u2013 she noticed. \u2013 By the way, my name\
  \ is Fatimah\u201D\n\nI introduced myself, and I invited her to have a glass of\
  \ orange juice with me in the Jemaa El-Fna square, which was nearby, since I heard\
  \ it was a very refreshing juice. After we ordered, she told me more about her and\
  \ I was intrigued about how similar our goals were. Fatimah also aspired to travel\
  \ the world, learning about new cultures and places. I noticed her eyes sparkling\
  \ while she was speaking about it.\n\n- \"The problem is \u2013 she explained \u2013\
  \ here in Morocco the coin, Dirham, is much devalued in relation to Euro or Dollar,\
  \ which makes it difficult to me to afford to travel in other continents\".\n\n\
  Then, the call to pray sounded involving the whole city. She said goodbye and I\
  \ thought to myself how privileged I was! What makes a girl of my age, just as intelligent\
  \ as me, and able to speak English, French and Arabic better than me, to have fewer\
  \ opportunities to accomplish her dreams, only because she was born 600 kilometers\
  \ away?"
