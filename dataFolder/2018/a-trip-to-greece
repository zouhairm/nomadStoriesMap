Text: "Athens\n  Greece was a cultural experience for me like any adventure you go\
  \ on. Getting off the plane, arriving at Athens was an experience in itself. People\
  \ rushing to get from place to place, little shops with handmade truffles and frappes.\
  \ Definitely not America. The Man who greeted us at the exit was very inviting and\
  \ from what I have come to learn about Greece is that almost everyone is. The Plaka\
  \ is one of the most charming places I have ever encountered, The shops, the cafes,\
  \ The restaurants. I was astonished at Athen's beauty and the people's welcoming\
  \ nature. In The center of the Plaka there is a hole in the wall restaurant that\
  \ we ended up finding that had a balcony above a tiny square and in the square you\
  \ saw more people eating, more people drinking and even more people walking in the\
  \ same amazement as I was. Heading back to our hotel we got into a conversation\
  \ with our cab driver, He told us the real struggles of living in this country and\
  \ how bad the economy was. Hearing the severity you wouldn't have known by the look\
  \ of the place, because when you look at the people smoking their cigarettes with\
  \ friends over breakfast all you see is happiness. \n           Paros And Anitparos\n\
  Paros is a small island connected by an even smaller island called Antiparos. The\
  \ town is tiny but gorgeous, Its in fact so small that we accidentally asked the\
  \ owner of our hotel directions to our hotel. We went to a tavern right on the beach\
  \ where cats would surround you while eating bread with olives. A boy with a backpack\
  \ came running up to what seemed to be his grandma, asking her about homework. Seeing\
  \ that you can't help but wonder if they know how lucky they are to live in such\
  \ a place like this. \n    I saw raw culture when we decided to head over to Antiparos,\
  \ We took a ferry that was only about 5 to 10 minutes long and in that short time\
  \ we had already found a place to stay. A guy was renting out his little apartment\
  \ in Antiparos for 30 euro, I'll repeat that 30 euro! It was about the cutest town\
  \ and real greek life resided there, the windows were open to see little old ladies\
  \ apartments with lace decorations everywhere with a bed dead smack in the middle\
  \ with a kitchen right next to it. It rained while we were there but we walked anyways\
  \ to meet an old women who had more cats then the fingers on your hands. She talked\
  \ to us for almost an hour telling us about her life here and the good restaurants\
  \ of course!"
