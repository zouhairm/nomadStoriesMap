Text: "After two nights travelling through Rajasthan, I arrived in Bikaner for the\
  \ annual camel festival. I joined the throng of enthusiastic locals at the race\
  \ track to watch the camels parade, where dozens of animals of all shapes and sizes\
  \ strutted past with an air of arrogance. They were beautifully decorated with flowers,\
  \ ribbons and intricate patterns shaved into their fur and were being led by their\
  \ trainers who were equally well attired in flowing white gowns and twisted turbans.\
  \ The parade proceeded smoothly except for the last camel, which was \u2018skitty\u2019\
  \ - jumping, skipping and pulling - as the parade progressed. Suddenly, it broke\
  \ free from its trainer and awkwardly galloped out of the arena and into the crowd.\
  \ The trainer immediately gave chase and caught the lead rope, which was trailing\
  \ behind like a slithering snake.  His tenuous hold on the rope seemed more like\
  \ a comedy sketch, as he was dragged against his will in a ballooning cloud of dust.\
  \ Others soon gave chase, which spooked the animal even more. It kicked and jumped\
  \ but, as with all camels, it eventually ran out of energy and the sheer number\
  \ of people surrounding it, made it stop completely. The trainer, glistening in\
  \ sweat and now in less than pristine attire, led the large dromedary back to the\
  \ race track to rejoin the line of patiently waiting camels.  The recalcitrant creature\
  \ returned to the track meekly, without even so much as a startle. The public were\
  \ then invited to ride the camels. I was eager to participate but all the camels\
  \ had been allocated to others. All that is, except one. It was the last thing I\
  \ had expected but \u2018Skitty\u2019 and I were destined to be companions! The\
  \ trainer looked extremely unhappy that a weak, young girl had clambered aboard\
  \ his unpredictable beast of burden. For the next hour, we trekked through the streets\
  \ of Bikaner and \u2018Skitty\u2019 didn\u2019t misbehave at all, apart from a couple\
  \ of little skips to keep his trainer on edge. I just enjoyed the tour of the town,\
  \ sitting high up in the rocking saddle and waving to the passing crowd - and \u2018\
  Skitty\u2019 was one of the best-behaved camels of the train."
