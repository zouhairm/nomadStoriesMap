Text: "What was meant to be a simple break from work, a refreshing weekend on the\
  \ slopes in Queenstown actually resulted in one of the most incredible travel memories\
  \ that I have. \n\nFor those who don't know me, I am terribly fearful of heights.\
  \ Blame it on a past life or a traumatised childhood visiting the blue mountains\
  \ but now I fear glass staircases, standing on a ladder, standing close to any edge!\n\
  \nThis crisp morning, on our way to the ski shop we dropped in at the adventure\
  \ activity stand where my friend stole my credit card and signed me up for tandem\
  \ paragliding. \nIt was paid for! There was no backing out. But the following morning\
  \ on my way to the airstrip I could feel the lump growing in my throat, my stomach\
  \ churning and heart racing. The snake like road weaving it's way through lord of\
  \ the rings mythical scenery was a needed distraction. \n\nOnce kitted out in the\
  \ caccoon case i was strapped in and our glider tied up to the light aircraft ahead.\
  \ The engine growled to life and the wheels began to roll down the runway. As we\
  \ lifted away, my grip tightened and knuckles turning white, eyes closed shut. But\
  \ then I realised, there's only this one opportunity, only one life, enjoy it, test\
  \ your fears. \n\nThe mountain air whipped my cheeks and continued to cool as we\
  \ ascended. The turquoise glacial lake lay below at the baron mountain base, opposite\
  \ hills undulating along the lakes edge and into the distance, to Paradise and beyond.\
  \ \nThe sun shimmering a warm glow over this beautiful region of glenorchy, a picture\
  \ perfect moment forever emblazoned in my memory. \n\nThe tether between glider\
  \ and plane was cut. Our engine flew off and we nose dived from the heavens to reality\
  \ that wait below. After what felt like eternity, in reality would have been 20\
  \ seconds, we started to balance out and gracefully glide like an elegant eagle.\
  \ I let go of whatever fear remained, loosed my grip and stretched my arms out wide.\
  \ \nFlying through the air was a sensation I will never forget and that feeling\
  \ of accomplishment that I overcame my fear, to be able to experience such natural\
  \ beauty and to simply enjoy the moment.  \n\nUpon landing, I turned to the pilot\
  \ and said 'let's do it again.'"
