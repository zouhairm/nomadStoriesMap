Text: "Travelling from Aachen to Berlin, sitting in the train, sipping hot coffee\
  \ and writing this piece. I have been travelling since few months and am now starting\
  \ to feel like a nomad. \nThe day I reached Berlin, I met one of my friends and\
  \ a Turkish couple in the evening. The girl was wearing a Hijab with an Indian style\
  \ dress. The connection to India for her was Shahrukh Khan (A Bollywood actor considered\
  \ to be extremely, sometimes annoyingly romantic). Apparently Shahrukh Khan is very\
  \ famous here in the Muslim community.\nTo know a society you just have to walk\u2026\
  \ Just start walking \u2013 and you will get to know more than what you will learn\
  \ in a college or university. We walked for hours, through a lonely park and the\
  \ crowded streets. Saw a group of druggies lying down and enjoying the hot summer.\
  \ This area of Spandau is famous for its young crowd who want to dope.\nA week passed\
  \ and I got to know some very interesting facts about the city. It was surprising\
  \ to know that there is a Soviet memorial park on the eastern side of the city considering\
  \ its history. The park was big with gigantic statues and monuments symbolizing\
  \ strength, power and great sacrifices done by the Soviet Union. I sat down after\
  \ the tour, took out my bottle of water and suddenly I heard them talking - loudly.\
  \ At first I tried to ignore them but couldn\u2019t, thought they might be having\
  \ an argument over the war; He was talking about his grandfather and his involvement\
  \ in the war. I got curious and went to them \u201CHi, sorry I couldn\u2019t stop\
  \ hearing you guys. You guys are talking about world war two, RIGHT?\u201D. They\
  \ immediately introduced themselves and the Russian guy said \u201CWe call it \u201C\
  THE WAR\u201D and smiled at me\u2026. and again started telling his story. He said\
  \ \u201CMy grandfather doesn\u2019t like to talk about the war, he is not very proud\
  \ of it\u201D and the Estonian woman agreed to it. The Russian was telling the story.\
  \ Acting rather than narrating would be a better word to describe him. The Estonian\
  \ girl was adding a few things in his act and another Italian was the audience to\
  \ their performance. I on the other hand was neutral and thinking \u201CHow different\
  \ my history is from theirs\u201D. We don\u2019t talk about war. We talk about the\
  \ Independence struggle. \nBerlin contains everything; a place which consumes you,\
  \ and at the same time throws you on the streets to show the reality of life. You\
  \ can be whatever you want to be and no one is going to judge you for what you are."
