Text: "As you read these lines, there are over a hundred species of mammals breathing\
  \ fresh air in the Monteverde cloud forest. Not to mention the hundred and sixty\
  \ species of reptiles that are moving through the humid dirt. Or, the exotic birds,\
  \ peacefully flying above the majestic trees. It is the biggest living natural history\
  \ museum, and its unpredictability and life will embrace you as you land. Besides\
  \ having the privilege to reunite so much diversity in one place, Monteverde also\
  \ has the highest bungee jumping in Central America. \n\nMy adventurous spirit carried\
  \ me to blend two of my passions: Adventure and Nature. With emotion, fear, a determined\
  \ mindset, and confidence, I hop on a taxi and wait, until I reach the jumping point.\
  \ Along the way, people smile, carrying their market bags or entering the nearest\
  \ convenience store. Walking peacefully, with a coordinated pace, they create a\
  \ loving and compassionate ambiance. Others choose to simply admire. Sitting on\
  \ a perfectly located bench, mindfulness and freedom collide. In Monteverde, houses\
  \ and Human lives merge with Nature and tranquility. The sunlight is longer than\
  \ the highways, and the mountains are taller than living spaces. The connectedness\
  \ to Nature is as unique as the attractions this destination offers. \n\nAfter a\
  \ couple of minutes in the car, I reach the point I've been waiting for. Little\
  \ did I know about it, but it was going to become the point where my decisions will\
  \ make me scream. This point would be my door to physically and mentally travel\
  \ to another world. Another level of connection with myself. This point will take\
  \ me really low, and really high, it will make me feel the unexpectedness of life.\
  \ The rise and fall of emotions, the questions, answers, and satisfactions.  \n\n\
  A little platform hanging from two cables slowly takes me to the middle. In between\
  \ two mountains, hanging in the sky, I look around and all I see is Nature. All\
  \ I see is eternity, and the sky. \"Lista\" the men in charge of my security pronounce.\
  \ This word invade my body until it reaches my bones. I count until three and jump.\
  \ I scream, I laugh, I cry. \n\nI reach my room in the afternoon, after forcing\
  \ myself to fall off the edge, and I journal. The experience was the expectations\
  \ and emotions I had prior to jumping. It was recognizing that traveling is not\
  \ what you think. It destroys you, brings you back together, and shows you that\
  \ you think you're gonna plan an experience, but unexpectedly, the experience makes\
  \ you."
