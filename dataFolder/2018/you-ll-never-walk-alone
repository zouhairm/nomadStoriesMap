Text: "On the 500-mile Camino de Santiago trek across Spain, I limped along a stretch\
  \ of isolated muddy wilderness, the stabbing pain from my injured right Achilles\
  \ amplified by the rain. Sitting in front of a farm house I prayed someone would\
  \ take pity and let me in. I considered sleeping in an abandoned shack but quickly\
  \ changed my mind when I saw the ominous meat cleaver laying just inside the doorway.\
  \ I pushed on.\n\nAhead on the trail was an old man, a bright red poncho draped\
  \ over him and his pack, giving him an odd hunchback-like appearance. His name was\
  \ Albert, and although I knew no German and he didn\u2019t speak any English, we\
  \ talked at each other in our own languages anyway.\n  \nA lone pink house appeared,\
  \ with people in the front yard. \u201CCoffee!\u201D exclaimed Albert excitedly.\
  \ We were halfway down the driveway before I realized this was not, in fact, a caf\xE9\
  .\n\nThe group stopped mid-conversation and turned to stare at us. What a sight\
  \ we must have been, me and my red hunchbacked friend! Their shocked expressions,\
  \ however, quickly turned to smiles, and they waved us in, exclaiming \u201CPellegrinos!\u201D\
  \n\nThey offered food, and In broken Spanish I explained I was a vegetarian, so\
  \ they stuck a fork in the salad bowl and placed it in front of me. Is your friend\
  \ a vegetarian too? \u201CI\u2019ll ask him.\u201D \u201CAlbert,\u201D I said in\
  \ English, \u201CDo you..\u201D I pointed at him \u201CEat..\u201D I mimed eating\
  \ and rubbed my belly, \u201CMeat\u201D I said, making a \u201CMoo\u201D sound like\
  \ a cow. A smile spread across his face, and he nodded enthusiastically \u201CDa!\u201D\
  \n\nThe plate was piled high with 7 steaks, and drinks were generously poured. As\
  \ I conversed with our hosts, Albert blissfully lounged, smoking a cigar, not understanding\
  \ a word. They were police on a weekend retreat, happy to meet us and curious to\
  \ learn why a blonde girl from LA was hiking through the woods with a jolly German\
  \ hunchback.\n\nAs the sun set we gladly accepted a ride, even if it meant I only\
  \ hiked 495 Camino miles. The volunteers at the mission asked if Albert and I were\
  \ together. I told them yes.  \u201CWhere is he from?\u201D  \u201CGermany,\u201D\
  \ I said.  \u201CHow old is he?\u201D they questioned.  \u201CI\u2019ll ask.\u201D\
  \ I turned to Albert, pointing at myself \u201CI. am. 27 years,\u201D I said, holding\
  \ up two fingers, then seven, before pointing at him, asking \u201CYou?\u201D  \u201C\
  Ah!\u201D he said, showing all ten of his fingers, placing them on the table in\
  \ front of him, grinning and nodding at me.  He repeated this 6 times, then held\
  \ up 4 more.  I turned to the volunteers, \u201CHe\u2019s 64 years old,\u201D I\
  \ explained with a grin."
