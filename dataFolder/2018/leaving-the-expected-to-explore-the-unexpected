Text: "By their early thirties many people have taken the path of what's expected;;\
  \ study hard and graduate university, get a corporate job, get married, buy a house,\
  \ all the things that have been engrained for us to be successful. At 33, I was\
  \ on that exact path and I was miserable. I knew there was more to life, then slaving\
  \ away in corporate America for a company that would replace me in 10 minutes. While\
  \ my friends where celebrating promotions or baby showers, I was constantly dreaming\
  \ of scenarios of going to the airport with my passport in hand and not looking\
  \ back.  \n\nI started to ponder the idea of taking a few months off and travel,\
  \ but I knew that would be a short term solution (as well as drain my bank account)\
  \ knowing when I returned the underlying issue would still be looming. I knew if\
  \ I was going to make a decision so life altering, I had to go big or go home. I\
  \ remembered an acquaintance spent some time in South Korea teaching English, I\
  \ so tracked him down to learn more. The more we spoke and the the more people he\
  \ introduced me to, I knew this was something I had to do. \n\nReactions from my\
  \ family and friends was mixed, many were supportive, even envious. Many were extremely\
  \ worried about giving up my career, being so close to North Korea or even the fact\
  \ that I would be missing their wedding. I followed the expected my entire life,\
  \ but this was the one time I chose to truly go into the unknown. Eight months later,\
  \ I boarded a plane for Seoul and didn't return for three years. \n\nUpon arriving\
  \ in Seoul, I was blinded by the lights, the skyscrapers and the sheer amount of\
  \ people. As I settled into my new apartment and school, I felt a sense of normalcy\
  \ and comfort. Unlike many other new arrivals, I didn't have culture shock, I had\
  \ an overwhelming sense of curiosity and excitement. I began to explore museums\
  \ and parks whenever I could. I began to make local friends who introduced me to\
  \ great restaurants and hidden temples. I was always up for anything and excited\
  \ when things were outside my comfort zone, feelings I never had back in the States\
  \ It was the happiest I have ever been. \n\nThere would be many solo trips throughout\
  \ Asia as well. Exploring Taiwan, Vietnam, Cambodia, China, Japan, and Indonesia\
  \ solidified the new experiences I craved all the years before. After three years\
  \ in Seoul, I made the choice to return to the States. I look back on my memories\
  \ and I know, taking that leap to give up the expected was the best decision I ever\
  \ made."
