Text: "It was nearly 10 am on a Thursday in October. The year? 2017. I had just landed\
  \ in Boston, Massachusetts for the first time ever. It was cheaper to fly into Boston\
  \ than it was to fly into my destination state, which was Vermont. My first instinct\
  \ was to go to Harpoon Brewery\u2014a brewery that a college friend recommended.\
  \ Once I got there, I ordered a beer flight and opened my CouchSurfing app to see\
  \ if any Boston locals were available to show me around the city. \n\nWhile consuming\
  \ my homemade pretzel with beer cheese, the only message I received while at the\
  \ brewery was from a guy who wanted to grab a beer later rather than sooner. \n\n\
  I continued aimlessly exploring the city of Boston for a good portion of the afternoon.\
  \ \n\nAround 2:30 pm, I checked my messages on CouchSurfing and noticed that I had\
  \ a message. This message was from Ian, a Boston local who also happens to be completely\
  \ blind. \n\nAbout an hour later, we met outside of Tasty Burger at Boston's Back\
  \ Bay Station on Dartmouth St. Next thing I knew, Ian was clutching my right arm\
  \ and saying, \"Alright, we're getting a beer!\" and we ended up at one of his favorite\
  \ pubs in Boston. He insisted that we both get Sam Adams in a tall glass, since\
  \ it was my first time in Boston. I acquiesced to Ian's suggestion and two deliciously\
  \ frothy beers were in front of us. I guided Ian to his adult beverage and we attempted\
  \ to cheers with moderate success. \n\nThe bartender was quite entertained by our\
  \ banter! We ended up staying at this pub for a while--chatting, laughing, and observing\
  \ Boston locals in our unique ways. The afternoon turned into the evening and we\
  \ continued our tour of the Boston pubs. We ended up going to 2 more drinking establishments,\
  \ took public transit (for free!), and got to pick up my white Nissan Altima--that\
  \ Ian complimented, despite not being able to see it.\n\nEventually, I had to continue\
  \ on to Vermont for the next part of my adventure. I dropped Ian off at his place\
  \ of residence and we officially parted ways.\n\nSpending time with Ian was completely\
  \ incredible! Honestly, I had never spent any extended period with anyone who was\
  \ totally blind until this trip. His positive energy was contagious and nothing\
  \ stopped him from living his life. Being blind gives Ian an unseen perspective\
  \ of The Cradle of Liberty that he shares with fellow CouchSurfers as much as he\
  \ can. \n\n It was a completely unexpected local connection that I never would have\
  \ made, had I not opted to fly into Boston, Massachusetts."
