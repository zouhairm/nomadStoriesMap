Text: "I didn\u2019t know I liked to travel, until I met you. Only moving to Florida\
  \ from New York for a unexpected short time. You came, and saved me. Picked me right\
  \ up off my feet. You made sure I would be backpacking home safely. Staying in central\
  \ Florida for about 5 days together. We started off packing up my things and heading\
  \ to the nearest body of water. We had lunch. It started to rain and you were so\
  \ patient and helpful. My convertible top was broken, so we were practically getting\
  \ rained on but we picked up some tape and were on on our way. We met Jerry McGuire\
  \ and his wife who were kind and made sure we stopped in Tybee beach. There we went.\
  \ That hidden gem was amazing. My first lighthouse, and it was with you. Next stop,\
  \ NC! Nothing to great here but the hotel was the best we stayed in on our trip!\
  \ Washington D.C. was special, especially because I got to share it with you. You\
  \ asked me at our Airbnb if I would be your girlfriend. I said \u201Care you sure?\u201D\
  . You are a political figure, seeing you in this realm was extraordinary. Exploring\
  \ momuments, history, and late nights under the stars. I know you\u2019re passion,\
  \ and you will make a great president. Philly next. The most culturally life changing.\
  \ Seeing the streets, specifically the people. The infrastructure. The liberty bell,\
  \ the dramatic history we choose to accept as what really happened. Giving the homeless\
  \ the extra food we had and staying with an old friend I haven\u2019t seen in forever.\
  \ Just beautiful. When we came home, I moved in with you. I think traveling is happily\
  \ ever after. Mainly because, you\u2019re free and in love. It was the last thing\
  \ I expected that would come from this trip. I would never take it back."
