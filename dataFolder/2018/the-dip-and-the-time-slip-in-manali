Text: "THE DIP AND THE TIME SLIP IN MANALI\n\nAdventures at the foothills of himalayas\
  \ rejuvenate oneself. It\u2019s a feeling of escaping from a competitive and real\
  \  world. Pausing life for a few seconds from those adventures can take you to a\
  \ different dimensions.   \n\nA short trip to Manali, Vashisht village. The village\
  \ itself has some distinctive history. Main feature was an old temple dedicated\
  \ to lord Ram and Guru Vashisht. Locals and foreign tourist all over the temple.\
  \ I didn\u2019t got to see the temple properly and went straight ahead to the hot\
  \ water spring which was inside the temple. As I entered the bath, saw same throng.\
  \ \n\nSomewhere inside me wanted to experience the bath but the other moment was\
  \ making me afraid and nervous of bodyshamming among them. I never got so insecure\
  \ before.  \n\nNext morning at 5 am, I sneaked out of the hotel with a towel in\
  \ my hand. Luckly the temple was just 200 meters away from the hotel area. Never\
  \ walked alone in the freezing temperature. Whole village looks so different in\
  \ deep dark sleep. The only sound which was coming in the background was the beas\
  \ river flowing down the hill.\n\nTemple gates were opened, humming of morning chants\
  \ was coming out from the main deity doors. Whole temple & bath was constructed\
  \ with black stone bricks and wooden pillars, simply beautiful. I soon realised\
  \ there was no proper door of bathing area, only an entrance covered with small\
  \ curtain. Hot steam was coming out from the curtain opening.\n\nEarlier  I didn\u2019\
  t got the chance to explore the place visually. Now I noticed that there was no\
  \ roof on the bathing area. Morning skylight coming directly downwards. My skin\
  \ was feeling hot and cold shivers at the same time. Steam all over the sulfur water,\
  \ it feels like someone pause the time for me. \n\nFew elderly ladies were bathing.They\
  \ looks beautiful just like the nature outside the bath. Life seems calm and still\
  \ among them. This does not  seems the same hot bath. I took a few seconds dip inside\
  \ the pool and It feels like I slip time and went back to the guru vashisht era.\
  \ The sulfur water on my body raised the blood through my brain.  \n\nFirst you\
  \ will feel hot as lava inside the pool, but later the water will  except you and\
  \ allow you to unravel yourself.  The feeling can\u2019t be explained it only can\
  \ be feeled. Earlier, I was nervous and conscious about my body. The dip blurred\
  \ my eyes but finally give me a clear picture of nature inside me and outside me."
