Text: "Tango is a passionate dance and fast becomes a lifestyle for those who take\
  \ it up. My partner and I were the kind of avid tango dancers that took a lengthy\
  \ pilgrimage to Buenos Aires for the sole purpose of immersing ourselves in tango\
  \ culture at its source. Luckily for us within the first few weeks of our six-month\
  \ trip we discovered a veritable chocolate sampler box of Argentine tango to help\
  \ us on our way.\n\nEl Tanguata magazine celebrated a significant publication birthday\
  \ by hosting a free two-day festival \u2018inspiracion\u2019 inclusive of short\
  \ workshops with a plethora of tango dancers. This event set us up beautifully for\
  \ engaging in a relaxed manner with many of our dance idols and discovering new\
  \ ones. The highlight for us was encountering the infamous Norberto \u2018El Pulpo\u2019\
  \ Esprez (1966-2014).\n\nEl Pulpo was one of the most inimitable tango dancers in\
  \ the history of tango. Even distinguishing between nuevo, or new tango, and the\
  \ more traditional milonguero styles, Pulpo\u2019s nuevo style was utterly unique.\
  \ Pulpo earned the nickname \u2018The Octopus\u2019 for his languid movements and\
  \ specific leg entrapment style and was renowned for dancing to non-traditional\
  \ music with a glass of red wine or cigarette in one hand. My partner had introduced\
  \ me to El Pulpo\u2019s style which he felt was impossible to imitate successfully\
  \ without learning directly from the maestro himself. \n\nAs we gathered for our\
  \ lesson excited and a little intimidated we soon realised that there were only\
  \ a few others joining the workshop. Optimists as we are this appeared very favourable\
  \ for us but there was something in the way Pulpo reacted that demonstrated the\
  \ disappointment known only by those that have previously known great success. His\
  \ style, for me, was the equivalent of changing from aerobics to tai chi. We both\
  \ enjoyed the experience and decided to seek out Pulpo\u2019s regular classes. \n\
  \nPulpo reminisced of the time when there was an entire festival devoted to his\
  \ style and the proponents of this style were called \u2018Pulpitos\u2019. We spent\
  \ many evenings with Pulpo attending local milongas and talking extensively about\
  \ his life and all things tango. Sadly, Pulpo required a liver transplant but before\
  \ the operation could occur, on 16 July 2014 Pulpo succumbed to liver disease. We\
  \ may not solely dance Pulpo\u2019s iconic style, but we were both were deeply moved\
  \ by our connection with this exceptional tanguero who will forever be an inspiration\
  \ in our hearts."
