Text: "Will it be possible? Will we be able to make it? \nAlong with the temperature\
  \ in the hall, my temperature was also rising as the Pooja was not coming to an\
  \ end even after 1 hour of it's scheduled ending. \nMe and my family were on a ten\
  \ day trip to south India and it was our last day. We had a plan of going to Sula\
  \ vineyards for a vineyard tour and wine tasting after performing the Pooja at Triambakeshwar\
  \ Shiva Temple, Maharashtra, thereafter going to Mumbai airport to catch our flights\
  \ to Delhi and Bangalore. A perfect plan. \n\nBut here we were stuck in a pooja\
  \ which seems never ending. As the time was passing by, we all were getting dissapointed\
  \ as the chances of visiting vineyards were getting dimmer. I was getting furious\
  \ as my dream was shattering.\n\nFinally at 12 noon the pooja ended. We started\
  \ in our cab. It was a 5h 21 m drive to airport. We needed to reach there by 6 pm\
  \ to board our flights at 8 pm. Vineyard was 45 min drive on the same route but\
  \ with a 21 km detour. Mom and bhabhi asked us not to even think of visiting vineyard\
  \ as that can lead to miss our flights. I was convincing bhaiya to visit it even\
  \ if it's for 30 min. Both ladies were getting furious for even exploring this option.\
  \ The driver, all ears to our arguments asked one final time if we want to go to\
  \ vineyard or not ? My brother asked him to take the turn towards vineyard. Decision\
  \ taken.  I started jumping and kissing my brother all over. But mom and bhabhi\
  \ were angry.\nWe reached Sula and ran to the restaurant for wine tasting. It was\
  \ a breathtaking view of grapes plantation all around. Though we were in a hurry,\
  \ we enjoyed there to the fullest, and rushed off by 1:30 pm. Everyone was happy\
  \ till Google Map showed that it will still take 5 hr 20 min. Clearly we were missing\
  \ the 6 pm deadline. Even though brother tried to relax us by saying that in domestic\
  \ flights even if we reach 1 hr before the departure, we can check-in, but bhabhi\
  \ didn't buy this reason, she started her tirade against our decision and mom also\
  \  joined in with her.  There was an eerie silence for 3 hrs which felt like an\
  \ eternity  after that. Bhabhi only broke it jovially but tension was there in the\
  \ air. Calls were made to the airlines but sadly even the flights were on time.\
  \ \nWe reached airport by 7pm ,somehow we entered the airport running but flight\
  \ gates were closed. Our heart skipped a beat and sank for that minute. We pleaded\
  \ with the officer,he gave in and we caught the flight at the last minute."
