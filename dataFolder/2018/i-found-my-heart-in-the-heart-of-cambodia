Text: "Arriving in what I call the \u201Cheart of Cambodia,\u201D my own heart was\
  \ pounding as if it was about to leap out of the seat without me. My two male companions\
  \ sitting next to me, watching every move the locals made. Their faces filled with\
  \ apprehension behind the grins they were bearing, as they remembered everything\
  \ they had read about the country. I however, could not fathom any feelings of doubt.\
  \ I jumped up and off the bus to try and catch my heart that was long ahead of me.\
  \ This was exactly where I was meant to be. Siem Reap, a land that had been crippled\
  \ by war and genocide for years, felt nothing less than warmth. My travel companions\
  \ soon felt the same, as we made our first connection with the tuk-tuk (most common\
  \ and affordable form of transportation) drivers. Beyond grateful for our service,\
  \ the drivers-about 6 of them-bartered back and forth with each other to offer us\
  \ the best deal and we watched firsthand how difficult it can be to survive here.\
  \ Somehow despite the bantering, there was such a gentle ease between them, a mutual\
  \ respect and a silent giddiness behind their eyes that lit them up, even if it\
  \ was for only 1 American dollar. Anxious to get to our hostel, they finally settled\
  \ and we hopped in the tuk-tuk with our driver, Isham. He was a quiet man at first,\
  \ with a smile from ear to ear as we engaged in conversation with him. He has been\
  \ driving tuk-tuks for the past 22 years and being only 38 years old now, he started\
  \ at a fairly young age. He has a wife and three children back home and two of the\
  \ other drivers are his brothers, the rest of them his friends. This explained the\
  \ connection between them, aware of the need to provide for themselves and their\
  \ own families but unquestionably knowing the others needed the same thing, there\
  \ was no greed between them. Isham asked if we were going to the Temples of Angkor\
  \ during our stay, to which our response of course being, \"YES\" he offered to\
  \ take us early the next morning, before the sun got too hot. We were delighted\
  \ by his offer because we felt safe and trusted him and in turn we were able to\
  \ support his livelihood, doing what we could to help him and his family. We had\
  \ only been in Southeast Asia for 30 hours and after a seemingly tolerable 24 hour\
  \ flight-compared to our 12 hour bus ride-to get to Siem Reap, we felt light-years\
  \ away from our home country, Canada. As if we transported to a different world,\
  \ a different culture, a different perspective on life and our journey had only\
  \ just begun."
