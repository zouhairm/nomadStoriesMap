Text: "The snowbanks tower over us. Vertical white walls sandwich our path as we shuffle\
  \ toward the wooden building that houses the entrance to the hot springs. The chorus\
  \ of fresh snow crunching under our boots is accompanied by the constant hum of\
  \ an unseen snow plow perhaps nearby. Our senses are distorted by the insulating\
  \ white walls. Several feet of snow plank the path. Beneath our feet, more snow.\
  \ The cloudy sky above us serves as the fourth white wall in our cubic snow globe.\
  \ \n\nCamouflaged from nearly every angle, the falling snow is impossibly voluminous\
  \ and yet only perceptible in the very last moment of its descent against the backdrop\
  \ of someone\u2019s dark winter coat, as it if appearing out of nowhere. It quickly\
  \ mounds like cotton candy on our shoulders when we stop but for a moment. We're\
  \ used to snow at home in Toronto, but not like this.\n\nWe\u2019ve arrived in Akita\
  \ for three days of promised peace and healing in the hot springs of the Japanese\
  \ mountainside. All of the women in our tour group live in Seoul, with the exception\
  \ of me and my mother. In need of escape from the very family we came to visit in\
  \ Seoul, we absconded to the northern part of Japan through a travel agency we found\
  \ in the Seoul metro. \n\nOur tour guide collects everyone\u2019s phones before\
  \ we enter the change room. Cellphones are forbidden. The other women protest in\
  \ exaggerated jest. They argue the beauty being witnessed deserves proof of existence.\
  \ My mother and I observe these women of Seoul in equal parts curiosity and derision.\
  \ How are they to benefit from the promised peace if they\u2019re too busy taking\
  \ selfies?\n\nWe waste no time shedding our clothes and slip beyond the sliding\
  \ doors to the outdoor springs. The murky grey pool is set amidst tall pines weighed\
  \ down by snow. Once everyone is seated in a circle in the pool, a woman stands\
  \ up and reveals that she did not relinquish her phone. But to atone, she offers\
  \ to take photos of everyone. The circle morphs into a line as the phone is retrieved\
  \ from the change room.\n\nThe first to get their photo taken stand waist deep in\
  \ the water and cup their breasts with their hands \u2013 a racy modesty as the\
  \ fog and snowflakes help to obscure some of their bits. As the line proceeds, shyness\
  \ is increasingly abandoned. Nipples kiss the cold air so that hands can be formed\
  \ into peace signs. My mother and I look at each other and acknowledge that this\
  \ too must be a way to find peace and healing. We get in line. The falling snow\
  \ melts on our warm skin."
