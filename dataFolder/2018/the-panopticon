Text: "\u201CVisibility is a trap.\u201D\n  -Michel Foucault, Discipline and Punish\n\
  \n Everybody, wherever they live, has a favorite bar. This is a universal truth.\
  \ The themed drinks, the chalkboard specials, the free-handed pours, the board games\
  \ in the corner, etc. It's where you go when you want to see a face you recognize\
  \ and a drink you can stomach. This favorite bar is in a place that is still half-magic:\
  \ a town called San Cristobal de las Casas in the deep pockets of Chiapas, Mexico.\n\
  \ There is only one way to walk inside the bar, and that is with difficulty. You\
  \ have to sidle in from the andador by pushing aside the deck chairs sprawled underneath\
  \ afternoon umbrellas. Then your eyes will need a few moments to adjust to the basement\
  \ style lighting. It should be just enough time for the overblown portrait that\
  \ is hanging on the wall directly in front of you to come into focus. That's right.\
  \ It is a wall-to-wall black and white print of Michel Foucault's face. Is he grimacing\
  \ or grinning? Nobody will ever be sure.\n The name of the bar is El Pan\xF3ptico\
  \ and the walls are betrayingly angular. Ninety degrees at every corner. There is\
  \ virtually no other d\xE9cor besides this one portrait, and most of the tables\
  \ are empty. The bartender is not a bartender but in fact the owner, a man named\
  \ Fabricio, who is by all accounts put out by your simple presence. You have disrupted\
  \ what appears to have been an intense match of chess with himself that was being\
  \ carried out under one of the umbrellas. In fact, you didn't even notice him sitting\
  \ there until he got up.\n An unnamed beer is poured from the single tap and consumed\
  \ at one of the barstools in near silence. The taste is inscrutable.\n Things will\
  \ go on this way for the first few visits, but don't get discouraged. For no other\
  \ reason but proximity, Fabricio eventually begins to take an interest in what you\
  \ are reading. In this case it is The Savage Detectives by Bola\xF1o. He comments\
  \ favorably upon it. You get to talking. He tells you all sorts of arbitrary things.\
  \ First, the Najdorf Variation is the most beautiful move in all of chess. You just\
  \ push the pawn forward so harmlessly, like an old lady picking up and setting down\
  \ objects at a yard sale. Third, everybody wants to be an entrepreneur. Just look\
  \ around you. \n Wait, what was the second?\n He waves his hand in a sweeping motion,\
  \ but all you can see is the portrait on the wall. Don't worry. Someone will always\
  \ be looking out for you, he says, pouring us both another drink."
