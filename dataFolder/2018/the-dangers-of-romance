Text: "All I had ever known of Australia was danger. Venomous snakes, jellyfish that\
  \ could kill you with a single sting, and spiders the size of nightmares. Nothing\
  \ about the country ever seemed appealing, but somehow I discovered the one thing\
  \ I loved about it. His name was Aidon, and I found myself sitting anxiously on\
  \ a 14 hour flight to Sydney just to get to him. \n I met Aidon in my hometown of\
  \ Los Angeles on a sweaty July night. He was traveling for work and we spent an\
  \ entire week fully immersed in one another. After a very painful goodbye, I figured\
  \ that would have been the last of us. However, fast forward months, FaceTimes,\
  \ texts, phone calls, and multiple plane rides later, here I was making my first\
  \ big trip to the land down under. \n I arrived in Sydney early on a bright spring\
  \ morning, and standing in the baggage claim was my handsome Australian. He greeted\
  \ me with a hug and a warm kiss, and it felt like one of those romantic airport\
  \ movie moments everyone secretly dreams about. This time he was going to be the\
  \ tour guide, and I was now the tourist.\n \u201CI hope you never take all of this\
  \ for granted,\u201D I told him as we swam in crystal blue water at Salmon Haul\
  \ down in Cronulla. \u201CEverything about your country is so beautiful and romantic.\u201D\
  \ \n The beaches felt like pure magic, with nothing but refreshing clear water and\
  \ warm soft sand that your toes and thoughts couldn\u2019t help but get lost in.\
  \ I hugged a Koala at Symbio Wildlife Park, hiked astray in the Blue Mountain\u2019\
  s with only the cacophony of birds to help me find my way home, and spent a drunken\
  \ night in Sydney discovering gay culture for the first time on the other side of\
  \ the world. I could feel myself falling deeper in love with both him and the land.\n\
  \ But I was not the only one who seemed wooed by the magic of the country and the\
  \ charm of Aidon. One day while sitting on his balcony, Aidon excused himself to\
  \ go handle a problem that arose with one of his friends. He left me alone in his\
  \ apartment and suddenly I could feel his white walls closing in around me. He went\
  \ to go make amends with who I later found out would soon be his boyfriend. I immediately\
  \ felt like a dumb disillusioned American. \n I packed my bags and flew home the\
  \ next day, quickly leaving behind pieces of my heart that I have yet to go back\
  \ and collect. My fears of Australia turned out to be true, and despite all the\
  \ beauty and wonders I discovered, there was danger lurking in the places that I\
  \ thought felt most safe."
