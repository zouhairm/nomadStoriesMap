Text: "As if bored by the liveliness around me, I kept staring at the starless night\
  \ \u2013 filled with sparkling snow waltzing to the roaring music, welcoming the\
  \ advent of a new year. Every now and then, I would be blinded by puffs of white,\
  \ exhaled by strangers excitedly shoving me from all sides.\n\nIt was a hasty decision\
  \ on my part to have planned a solo trip to Germany. I was only 17, but escapism\
  \ had got a good grasp on me. Like all teenagers, I was eager to seek love in all\
  \ its forms. Yet, confused and scared, I was doubtful of \u2018my love\u2019 ever\
  \ being accepted as a societal norm. Amid the spreading rumours, I was dead set\
  \ on a getaway to somewhere which would not remind me of home.\n\nSo, there I was,\
  \ standing in the heart of this Berlin street party. Streams of bodies flowed around\
  \ me as they shuffled nearer towards the stage, under the mighty Brandenburg Gate.\
  \ Like a stone jutting out of a river, I was alone, cold with frozen senses, indifferent\
  \ to the dynamics around me. Lights were flashing, speakers were blaring, people\
  \ were cheering, kissing and mostly drinking. A slight push from behind and I felt\
  \ splashes on the back of my jacket, but I remained in reverie with my mind consumed\
  \ by weighty worries. \n\n\u201CZehn, Neun, Acht\u2026\u201D\n\nWhile the crowd\
  \ went wild in anticipation for the new year, I was eager to leave this celebration,\
  \ which was too much of a contrast to my mellow contemplation. \n\n\u201CF\xFCnf,\
  \ Vier\u2026\u201D\n\nJust as I was gazing at the darkness above, waiting for the\
  \ fireworks to illuminate the sky with bursting colours, a loud cheer drew my attention\
  \ back down.\n\n\u201CEins! Frohes Neues!\u201D And there it was \u2013 midnight\
  \ magic.\n\nMy heart raced with warmth, my watery eyes widened, my lips stretched\
  \ from ear to ear \u2013 I was smiling.\n\nEverything else around me paused, as\
  \ life had never looked so beautiful. People were cheering for the couple who had\
  \ declared their love unapologetically, as they kissed with embarrassed smiles on\
  \ their faces, forcing them to eventually burst into laughter of pure affection.\
  \ Engrossed in my own pessimistic sentiments, I had failed to notice the two men\
  \ in front of me all along \u2013 men who had thus imbued my being with strength\
  \ and gaiety I had never felt before.\n\n\u201CHappy New Year\u201D, I hushed softly\
  \ to myself. Head down, I turned and walked away with the claps of the lit-up sky\
  \ seemingly celebrating my unexpected discovery. I had dropped the fear I harboured,\
  \ shaken off something old within me for something new, something gay and finally,\
  \ something true."
