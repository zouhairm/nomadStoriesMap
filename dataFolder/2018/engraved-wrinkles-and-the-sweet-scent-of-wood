Text: "\u201CO-o-obrigado S-sir!\u201D \nThe waiter\u2019s face relaxed in a big triumphant\
  \ smile, after winning his stammer, while with both of his light-blue squint eyes\
  \ he stared at me curiously. He left me with my 3.25 euro bill paid for a beef steak\
  \ and some rice and beans. I drank all the beer left in the small glass and lazily\
  \ left the air-conditioned shelter that refreshed local Portuguese people there\
  \ in Porto, during the hottest hours of a bright summer day. \nThat\u2019s usually\
  \ the best place where you can meet local people similar to you, with the same culture\
  \ and age as yours. But not that day: I\u2019ve soon realised that is also possible\
  \ to create a deep connection with people far different from you for language, age,\
  \ and experience, that are not sharing with you anything but the fact of being both\
  \ human beings living in this world. \nWandering along Porto\u2019s most forsaken\
  \ alleys I\u2019ve suddenly heard an hypnotizing sound that was vibrating in the\
  \ air: I turned the corner of a street while a sweet scent of fresh cut wood filled\
  \ my lungs. An open wooden door led to a dark place: my eyes were able to recognise\
  \ the shade of an old man engraving the head of an elegant wooden walking-stick.\
  \ A lightbulb hung from the ceiling was slightly illuminating part of his body,\
  \ creating a chiaroscuro effect with every single wrinkle engraved in his aged face.\
  \ The ancient artisan invited me inside this shady place, where wooden chips and\
  \ dust were covering every inch of the craft workshop: \u201CBoa Tarde\u201D he\
  \ said, breaking the ice in this hot summer day: I\u2019ve soon realised that the\
  \ old man wasn\u2019t able to speak in English, and I was able to understand just\
  \ few words of his mumbled Portuguese. I tried with my mother-tongue, Italian, and\
  \ surprisingly, in some way, we were able to understand each other: he caught me\
  \ in this paradoxical conversation spoken in two different languages. Then he told\
  \ me about his artisan humble life, showing me a dusty black and white photograph\
  \ that an Italian artist had took of him some decades before, while his old and\
  \ deep eyes were slightly becoming wet, remembering his past life with his beloved\
  \ and beautiful wife.\nThat day, I could feel that we were giving birth to a soft\
  \ and clear bond, a real and honest connection between a 70 years-old artisan and\
  \ a 22 years-old young wanderer: our relationship has just transcended every cultural\
  \ barrier because in the end, what really count is that we were, and are, both Human.\n\
  \u201CBoa Tarde\u201D-he said.\n \u201CMuy Obrigado\u2026Thank you.\u201D"
