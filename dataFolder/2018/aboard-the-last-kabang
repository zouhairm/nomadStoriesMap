Text: "Aboard the Last Kabang\nBy Jenna Valley\n\nWe sprawl out across the bamboo\
  \ bow of the last Moken kabang boat- the pandanas sail haloed by the afternoon sun.\
  \ \n\nMy eyes pour over the markings in the vessel\u2019s old wood. I\u2019m reading\
  \ stories of it\u2019s years on the water- much the same stories found within the\
  \ lines that cascade from Sutad\u2019s kind dark eyes when he smiles. I learn he\
  \ smiles largest when speaking of his childhood on the sea.\n\nMoken once lived\
  \ on kabangs yearlong, with exception of the monsoon season. Flotillas formed for\
  \ celebrations, and to travel to the bay when the rains came \u2013 sometimes 100\
  \ boats at a time. \n\nThey thrived by free diving for the bounty below. Moken swim,\
  \ before they walk. They have an adaptive ability to hold their breath for an unrivaled\
  \ length of time. \n\nHis eyes sadden. We learn how mass tourism lead to the Islands\
  \ becoming a protected. The Moken can no longer fish, or fell trees to build kabangs.\
  \ They have been severed from their way of life. They have no rights in the Park,\
  \ and do not own land. Many do not even exist on paper. They are a displaced indigenous\
  \ people... a tourist attraction. This, the final kabang, crafted with water and\
  \ fire, becomes a symbol of both joy, and suffering.\n\nA large speedboat comes\
  \ out of nowhere\u2026people snapping pictures of us as they blow by\u2026a glimpse\
  \ into what it feels like in recent years for the shy Moken. \n\nThey disapear,\
  \ and we sail on.\n\nSutad is a small man, but his presence reaches beyond his physical\
  \ space. He breaths in deep, taking in air like a sail catching the wind, and dives\
  \ into the shimmering water. We are not long to follow suit.\n\nHis daughters giggles\
  \ echo through the water and permeate my heart, as I glide through the dancing light\
  \ and shifting colors along reef. I watch in awe, as Sutad dives straight down into\
  \ the depths, effortlessly sinking like a stone, then rising just a bit to explore,\
  \ holding his breath for lengths that stretch out like the sea itself. I imagined\
  \ him young, spear in hand, plunging with purpose, unaware of what\u2019s to come.\
  \ \n\nFilled with joy and sadness, I shed a few salty tears, and removed my goggles,\
  \ comforted, that they will wash away in the ocean without notice, vowing to share\
  \ the Moken story."
