Text: "As I slid from one corner of my cab to the other on the spiral roads, I finally\
  \ reached the town I had always wanted to visit, Ranikhet. The beauty of this town\
  \ in the mountains of Uttrakhand was beyond what one\u2019s words could encapsulate.\
  \ The snow-clad peaks of Nanda Devi and Trishul were a treat to the eyes. The tranquillity\
  \ surely led me to fall in love with it. My taxi driver, Babu Bhaiya, went on about\
  \ narrating instances of spotting leopards and tigers. As much as this thrilled\
  \ me, my conscious mind did not let me believe him.\n\nThe wind was whizzing and\
  \ the chillness in the air had begun to intensify. When I had decided to spend the\
  \ evening in the comforts of my blanket, the in-house Labrador of the cottage I\
  \ had rented called Pickles, nudged me out of my bed and made me go for a walk.\n\
  \ \nWe started walking on the Lower Mall Road, or what the urban settlers might\
  \ call a Jungle Safari. This put me in close proximity of the unscathed beauty of\
  \ nature. The road was attired with fallen leaves and the air smelt of fresh pines\
  \ and deodar trees. I saw a wonderful manifestation of colours as a hare ran across\
  \ the road and the jungle fowl pecked seeds. The universe seemed to slow down to\
  \ suit my pace away from the monotonous chaos of the urban dwellings. The atmosphere\
  \ was so serene and quiet that even our trudging echoed. Amidst the beauty of silence,\
  \ I heard the gurgling of a spring. Pickles reached out to the pristine water to\
  \ quench his thirst and so did I. That sip was undeniably the sweetest quaff I have\
  \ ever had. As we walked, Pickles explored every nook of the road and marked his\
  \ territory by ceremonially peeing the bark of the trees.\n\nThe sun had started\
  \ to set with a spectacular ombre which insinuated a sense of mysticism. There was\
  \ an alluring shift from crystal clear jungle to shadowy woods. I froze as we were\
  \ walking down a slope. My limbs were shaky and my face pale as I spotted a majestic\
  \ beauty right in front of me, regally gliding across the road. Despite being shaken\
  \ to the core, I gathered some courage and called out for Pickles in the lowest\
  \ baritone. Both the mammals turned towards me. The leopard seemed to be unsettlingly\
  \ disturbed. The very next moment, one ran towards me, while the other went down\
  \ the slope. This was one of the most nerve reckoning experiences I have had. My\
  \ conscious mind now believed that Babu Bhaiya had not been narrating mere stories.\
  \ This is when I laid my bare hands to appreciate the dynamism of the cosmos."
