Text: "It was there. Stable. Docile. With its eyes fixed, staring at the counter.\
  \ He sipped mint tea, a Moroccan specialty. It undeterred twirled its tail in time\
  \ to music. \"It can not be\" I say to Stefano. It is 11 o\u2019clock in the morning.\
  \ The Medina of Casablanca is a bustle of merchants. Screams chase each other through\
  \ the small streets surrounded by white houses with scraped off walls. \n\nThe bar\
  \ is located in the square, between Rue Al Bahriya and Rue de Safi. It is the territory\
  \ that demarcates the old Casablanca from the newest and modern part. 500 meters\
  \ from here, there is the new Casaport station. The glass and the steel create a\
  \ hypermodern construction that dominates the Boulevard ou Hamd and turns its back\
  \ to the sea.\n\nThere is a goat and a bar crowded with people. As we are about\
  \ to enter, it turns and looks at me. Like any human being, it is there, in the\
  \ bar of the Medina. Raise its eyes. A bleating. Then it turns back to look at his\
  \ master, who is holding its to a leash of fibrous material.\n\nIt sits like an\
  \ animal between so many humans. It embodies what Morocco is. Certainly not an animal,\
  \ but rather a contradiction. It is there to be sold at the nearest market, just\
  \ outside the old city. The Moroccan-style arch faces the much higher skyscrapers\
  \ with names of Western banks. It marks the entrance to the neighbourhood that gave\
  \ its name to the city because of the colour of its houses.\n\nWealthy gentlemen\
  \ in suits and ties come down from luxurious cars and immerse themselves in the\
  \ explosion of colours of the city market. Certainly it is not that famous as the\
  \ other ones of other Moroccan cities. The shouts exceed the decibels of small radios\
  \ that emit typical music. And a tail keeps spinning.\n\nIt moves the hips up to\
  \ the counter where it will be sold. Leather sandals and heavy cotton trousers,\
  \ brown like the ploughed earth, drag it. A smile on his face. The trip has been\
  \ long.  \u201CWe came from the countryside of the region\u201D tells me the farmer.\
  \ He Stops. He treats. He does not yield on the price. It is awarded. That spinning\
  \ queue is sold, even if not to the best bidder.\n\nA small change to get home.\
  \ A coffee together with his goat. He loosens the knot that binds it and takes the\
  \ leash back. He turns around. The face gets wet. Two small tears fall from the\
  \ pitch dark eyes. \u201CTonight we will eat something\u201D. The tears are not\
  \ made of happiness. He will miss that tail."
