Text: "I was irate. A whirlpool of feelings that gave me the power to punch a bag\
  \ with all my might and turn emotions into sheer sweat. In that moment of catharsis\
  \ at an unpleasant smelling boxing club.  I stepped in here wearing intimidating\
  \ heels and makeup you could not fault just a few weeks later after my fathers death.\
  \ When I was a child we used to watch boxing matches together and throughout my\
  \ lifetime I\u2019ve cherished and embraced that unusual moments shared with Tyson,\
  \ Holyfield and Lewis. It was our time\u2013 he was sober and I was happy. Body\
  \ shots from my insecurities were powerful, same as childhood memories jabs. \n\
  - I am done! \u2013I punched the bag with unspoken promise. Funny isn\u2019t it?\
  \ That the most paramount  decisions are mostly made in silence. I was finished\
  \ with empty existence followed by big paychecks every month. I was finished with\
  \ blaming my father for everything that went wrong in my life. I was finished with\
  \ excuses not to write. It makes perfect sense to me that enough is enough. I needed\
  \ a break through. A week after I was boarding a plane to Sicily. Sipping limoncello\
  \ at seven am and watching the sunrise from my window, kissing the surface of my\
  \ skin. Lonely street walks in moody Palermo were my cure. I finished the first\
  \ chapter of my book when I dined at the La Vucciria market restaurant one evening.\
  \ Vasco Rossi was playing, the loud scooters were passing chaotically, people were\
  \ chatting sociably. I was sitting there in my white dress which hugged my silhouette\
  \ admirably, the bottle of wine accompanying me almost empty. My dad taught me to\
  \ love sweet science and did several other good things, but my bitterns never allowed\
  \ me to admit that. Although I forgave this myself reluctantly, as I forgave him-\
  \ for years of shame and fear. He never asked for forgiveness, but I knew it has\
  \ to be given anyway. Not because he died- but because I need that in order for\
  \ me to be re-born. Ironically it had nothing to do with him. I might have lost\
  \ a few rounds so far, but not the whole fight. I was like this city \u2013 I survived.\n\
  - This song is about you, vita spericolata- the waiter lit up my cigarette and gave\
  \ me THAT look. Speechless conversations are the most powerful and they stay with\
  \ us forever stored away like precious jewels. The connection I made with him and\
  \ with myself was priceless. And that was it. My desired life was worth fighting\
  \ for. In my corner I have the greatest tutor. Myself. And vita spericolata. A reckless\
  \ life ahead."
