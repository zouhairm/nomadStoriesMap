Text: "It had been five years since I had planned to return to Philadelphia for a\
  \ stint, save money and head south to Latin America. But time has a funny way of\
  \ slipping. Bye. \nFinally, my then boyfriend and I embarked on a trip to Argentina.\
  \ We had an interest in relocating there, but wanted to investigate properly beforehand.\
  \ After traipsing around Buenos Aires for a couple of weeks, he returned to Philly\
  \ for work. It had not been a successful scouting trip for us as travelers, together,\
  \ and I was back to the drawing board of life. \nShortly after, I hopped on an 18\
  \ hour bus ride south to Puerto Madryn, a region of Patagonia known for its on and\
  \ off-land wildlife. I passed five rainy and cloudy but glorious days there, a town\
  \ which allows access to penguin preservations, snorkeling encounters with sea lions\
  \ at play, the passings by of Orca Whales, and typical Argentine life filled with\
  \ beautifully grilled steaks and late nights over tango and fernet. Suddenly, the\
  \ trip had became one of re-awakening, of finding that adventurous spirit I had\
  \ left behind. So I packed my bag and headed West: over Andes' way. \nI awoke from\
  \ another 18 hour marathon bus ride in the quaint Swiss-influenced ski town of Bariloche.\
  \ It was late summer in Argentina, and the town's Nahuel Huapi Lake shone with crystal\
  \ brilliance. The surrounding mountains were snow-capped, a combination that created\
  \ a warm crispness to the air. \nIt's a weird thing that happens when you travel\
  \ alone. Your mind has a lot of time to spend with itself. By the time I arrived\
  \ in Bariloche, I was on an esoteric high - life was an adventure that I couldn't\
  \ wait to begin again. By day two, I found myself seated in the back of a bright\
  \ pink propeller plane, harnessed to a man I had just met who was looking into my\
  \ terrified eyes with calming resolve. The flight to the jumping point lasted at\
  \ least another 18 hours. When the pilot finally announced our arrival, my heart\
  \ had overtaken my throat, rendering me incapable of a response. My shaking right\
  \ hand took grasp of a handle, the left timidly following. I looked straight out\
  \ in front of me and saw nothing but clouds. Deep breathes. Closed eyes. Three.\
  \ Two. One.\nIt was at least another three seconds before I was able to reopen my\
  \ eyes. And then: wow. \nI was flying. I was free."
