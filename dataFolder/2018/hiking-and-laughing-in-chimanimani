Text: "\u201CHiking!\u201D I yelped, interrupting my travelling companion as he ran\
  \ through the itinerary for our weekend retreat.\n\u201CIt\u2019ll be a walk in\
  \ the park\u201D, he grinned, knowing that there wouldn\u2019t be anything easy\
  \ about trudging across Chimanimani National Park.  \nIn my ignorance (and excitement)\
  \ of what lay ahead, I accepted what he said.  A week later we left Mutare town,\
  \ heading south.  \n\nSight of quartzite peaks, in every shade of grey, announced\
  \ that we had arrived.  How those mountains dominated the landscape!  Massive and\
  \ imposing, we had entered their world.  The road we took meandered respectfully\
  \ between the jagged blocks.  We got to Base Camp, paid the fees and hired a guide.\
  \  He was a cheerful guy, whom I am convinced smiled the entire five hours we trekked.\
  \   \n\nWe set off, accompanied by the smell of pinewood wafting from the nearby\
  \ plantations and sawmills.  Fuelled by enthusiasm, we were determined to get to\
  \ Mountain Hut in three hours.  Dotting the grassland were rocks, some had yellow\
  \ arrows painted on them.  Like children in a fairy-tale we followed them trustingly.\
  \  I think that\u2019s what caused us to start singing.  \n\nThe savannah gave way\
  \ to an expanse of craggy rock.  Our rambling became clambering.  Within ten minutes\
  \ I felt the exertion in my thighs.  We negotiated every move with the uncompromising\
  \ rocky incline; gruelling and sweaty business.  \n\u201CNot far to go,\u201D our\
  \ smiley guide encouraged.  The rock continued to make demands.  We reached a very\
  \ steep section where the rocks had formed a barricade.  \n\u201CI think you\u2019\
  ll need this\u201D, my travelling companion said, offering me his hand.  \nI took\
  \ it.  The tackling of the rock resumed.  I had to assume some unladylike postures\
  \ as I climbed.  \n\nIt was great when the landscape began to level out and we walked\
  \ on a grassy footpath again.  Chimanimani had declared ceasefire.  Mountain Hut\
  \ came into view.  \n\u201CYou did it!\u201D exclaimed the guide, smiling wider\
  \ than ever.  \nIn deed I had.  I didn\u2019t imagine that seeing that stone structure\
  \ would make me happy; reaching it would be my small victory over Chimanimani. \
  \ \n\nHaving recovered, we explored the surrounding area, taking in the spectacular\
  \ views of Bundi Valley.   Suddenly my travelling companion began to laugh.\n\u201C\
  Look at that moon!\u201D\nIn the direction he pointed, was a great boulder in the\
  \ distance that had the distinct shape of a person bent over.  The last laugh was\
  \ Chimanimani\u2019s \u2013 marvellous, mystical, mischievous hills."
