Text: "Our holiday in Greece was great, but it started in the following way: before\
  \ we went on holiday we have read a lot about locations, prices, hotel and so on.\
  \ We booked our room, everything was okay, but in a week we found out that the hotel\
  \ room is no longer available. The agency has proposed another hotel with all inclusive,\
  \ but we didn\u2019t accept (conditions weren\u2019t so good) and we chosed another\
  \ hotel.\n\nWe went to Greece by coach. In Romania the coach made a stop at a restaurant:\
  \ the bathroom was horrible, and the food... We just were eating two tablespoons\
  \ of soup and ready (when we came back from the trip, we stopped here again, but\
  \ we went to a restaurant next to that one, where we ate a delicious omelette and\
  \ a good coffee).\n\nIn Greece we arrived at 7.00 in the morning, we left our luggage\
  \ at the hotel and we went to explore the place around. We had learned a few words\
  \ in Greek, which was great for the locals, they were surprised.\n\nFor our first\
  \ breakfast, which wasn\u2019t at the hotel, we paid 12 euros: two coffees and two\
  \ croissants. Then we had the lunch in the nearest town \u2013 Kallithea and the\
  \ dinner at the hotel - located in Solina - the most quiet area with the most beautiful\
  \ beach. \n\nEveryday we have visited a new locality. The places were different\
  \ from each other by relief, prices and taverns. One more beautiful than another.\
  \ Some of them more animated, some more quiet. If you want bustle and fun, the most\
  \ animated areas of Kassandra Chalkidiki are Kallithea and Hanioti. We really enjoyed\
  \ Pefkohori and Afytos. The first one was at the periphery of the arm (South side),\
  \ it had a pedestrian and a narrow beach, but the advantage is that you can go straight\
  \ to a tavern to eat something on the beach.\n\nAfytos is the place at the highest\
  \ level of the arm. The village is old and you can see there narrow streets, old\
  \ cottages - mostly transformed into restaurants. When you look at them, you have\
  \ the impression that you have come to the past - we like such places. Also in Afytos\
  \ at a restaurant we were greeted in Romanian, after we were asked where we are\
  \ from, and we, in turn, greet the locals in Greek.\n\nOften after lunch or dinner\
  \ in the city, we were served with something free of charge from the restaurant\
  \ as gratitude: fruits or ice cream. On the last day, after check out, the hotel\
  \ offered us a free room to take a shower before going home, so we could go home\
  \ full of energy, being amazed by the hospitality of the Greeks and being happy\
  \ to making a local connection."
