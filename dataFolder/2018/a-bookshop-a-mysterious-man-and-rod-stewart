Text: "A year had passed since I moved to London and there I was again. After a more\
  \ than satisfactory job interview with a charming owner I felt released and ready\
  \ to come back home while having a little walk, contemplating the typical London-style\
  \ maisonettes. After at least ten minutes of walk, I run into this small and chaos-looking\
  \ bookshop. With no sign hanging on the outside, but just a dirty window glass to\
  \ promote the several second hand books to be found in its bookshelves I, without\
  \ hesitating, adventured and entered.  \n\nThe warm light of that morning coming\
  \ through the window gave an enigmatic halo to the place and its inhabitants. On\
  \ the right corner a voluptuous woman was peacefully sitting behind the counter\
  \ with a medium size dog lying down on her feet. When I came in a mere staring from\
  \ the owner was enough for me to felt greeted \u2013 or so I thought. A complete\
  \ silence surrounded us and before I could start feeling unsure about my decision,\
  \ the doorbell announced another visitant. This time, the dog welcomed the new incomer\
  \ and the woman draw a subtle smile while pressing the start button of an old white\
  \ kettle. As for him, the men saluted the quiet woman in a pretty much theatrical\
  \ manner, then, very enthusiastically; he started telling some sort of story. Quickly,\
  \ the owner hinted a sign towards me to point out my presence to that silver-mane\
  \ man whose blue eyes scrutinized mine forthrightly. \n\nThen, noticing my camera\
  \ hanging on my chest, he concluded that I must have been a photographer. Me, myself,\
  \ I am an artist too, he added while the owner nodded thoughtfully. Taking advantage\
  \ of that brief exchange, I decided to approach those two mysterious figures that\
  \ got me increasingly fascinated. Daring, compelling, funny, irreverent and at a\
  \ certain point dreamy, his stories fulfilled all my wildest expectations, leaving\
  \ me completely dazzled. His teenage year\u2019s recitals included a one so-called\
  \ \u2018Rod-before-he-became-famous\u2019. Yes, you know, Rod Stewart, he merely\
  \ explained. As I can recall that enchanting man were friends with the British rock\
  \ star and his sister, too \u2013 a young lady he would frequently visit by climbing\
  \ up the window.\n \nBefore I realized, an hour had passed. In an effort to keep\
  \ a record of what just had happened, I asked not only for his name but also for\
  \ his portrait. He accepted without qualm and before bursting into a loud laugh,\
  \ he added he hoped I was able to capture all his beauty in one shot. And yes, I\
  \ was indeed."
