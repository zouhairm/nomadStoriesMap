Text: "I am from Bolivia. I had planned on living my whole life there with no interest\
  \ in traveling. I was happy with my own world in my own city. However, for several\
  \ reasons I ended up moving with my family to Spain. I never thought that would\
  \ happen, but I also never thought it would open my mind in the many ways it has.\n\
  I began traveling when I was 20 years old. My first trip was Toledo-Spain and it\
  \ was amazing! I experienced a lot of culture, architecture, and stunning views.\
  \ Since then, I fell in love with traveling. One of my dreams was to travel to Mexico.\
  \ However, I knew it would be difficult so accepted that it would not happen. \n\
  Eventually I went to school in the United States. Before coming back to Spain I\
  \ said to myself, \" Maybe I can visit Mexico for a week\" So, I asked a friend\
  \ to go with me to Mexico. We started planning the trip, and my friend said, \"\
  Mexico is amazing and huge! Maybe we can go for a month and travel around the Southern\
  \ Mexico\" I thought, \"Traveling for a month around Mexico? This is crazy! I had\
  \ never traveled for more than 5 days!\" But at the same time I was super exited\
  \ to have an experience like this, so I said, \"Let's do it!\" So we extended it\
  \ to 40 days. We had no an specific plan. We just wanted to enjoy the trip wherever\
  \ it look us.\nOn September 28, 2016 we arrived at the Guadalajara. I was a bit\
  \ scared but also very exited for our adventure. My friend and I couldn't let ourselves\
  \ stop saying, \"Look at this!\" throughout the whole trip because everything was\
  \ astonishing and wonderful. We visited historic places like Teotiuacan, Chich\xE9\
  n Itz\xE1, Palenque. We ate, tortas ahogadas, chapulines (fried crickets) tlayudas,\
  \ pozole, tejate and so much more. We went to the Patzcuaro lake in Michoacan. It\
  \ is best known for \"El dia de los muertos\" (Day of the Dead) This is a traditional\
  \ holiday for Mexicans. It was amazing how people go to visit their family members\
  \ buried in cemeteries. They bring food for them all night long. I was speechless,\
  \ living this amazing holiday in Mexico, and I learned to love Mexico.\nIt was time\
  \ to say goodbye to Mexico and comeback home. During the flight to Madrid I thought\
  \ all the moments I'd lived during those 40 days in Mexico, and how many good moments,\
  \ fun and joy I had had. The last thing I expected in my life was to have the opportunity\
  \ to live such an experience like this, and fulfill one of my dreams. After this\
  \ trip I thought, \u201Cif I could travel around Mexico for 40 days I could achieve\
  \ any dream.\u201D"
