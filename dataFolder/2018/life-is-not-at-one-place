Text: "I always used to hate travel and I was supposed to afraid go out. I wanted\
  \ to stay at my room. But as soon as grew up ,I had to walk out for the examination\
  \ ,job etc. And it had became a routine for me. Few time later ,I realized that\
  \ ,I am loving to go out ,meet with the new people and exploring the new places\
  \ .\nHere I am telling one of the travel story that I took suddenly. One night ,I\
  \ was sitting with my friends and we were just talking about the places. They were\
  \ telling about the different beautiful places of India and how those places attracted\
  \ them.\nThen ,I suggested them to take a trip to Agra for right now. They got caught\
  \ on me and told me that a person who even do not talk about go on outing and he\
  \ is suggesting us to go on a Agra trip. \nThen ,at the same time, I packed up my\
  \ bag and asked them to come with me. One of them  agreed to come with me. We both\
  \ took the bus and headed to the Agra. We reached there early in the morning and\
  \ went to see  \"The Tajmahal\".  I loved that place and other many beautiful places\
  \ of the Agra. It is being said that it is the symbol of love.\nThis trip bring\
  \ me out of the fear of traveling alone and now I travelled whenever I got time.\n\
  Usually ,I love to on peaceful places."
