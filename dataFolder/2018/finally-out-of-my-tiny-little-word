Text: "It is funny how tiny my world has been. My parents had me in high school and\
  \ so I grew up poor. The only exploration I did was in the woods in my back yard.\
  \  My whole life all I could do was dream of travelling and finding some way to\
  \ get to the world and share my experience with others. Thirty-seven years of my\
  \ life I have lived in wonderment, but never actually getting to explore. You can't\
  \ imagine what it is like to only able to dream of the world, because I am too broke\
  \ to afford the luxury of seeing first hand. I finally took the plunge and planned\
  \ that dream get away. I knew it wasn't the best decision for a single mother of\
  \ two to make financially, but I pushed myself to the edge and allowed myself to\
  \ finally leave my tiny world of New Hampshire to visit Paris, France. \nFrom the\
  \ second I descended the steps of the plane into the crisp October sunrise at Paris,\
  \ Charles de Gaulle Airport I knew this is what I have waited for, dreamed of and\
  \ longed for my entire life.\nThe hotel I stayed in was in an older residential\
  \ neighborhood close to the Arc De Triumphe. It was too early to check in so I left\
  \ my luggage and  walked the half mile to the Arc. What a drastic difference in\
  \ culture there was to explore! The open markets with fresh fruit, the flower stands,\
  \ the bakery and specialty shops.  I use all my senses as I explored. I was giddy\
  \ and more exuberant than I had felt in many years despite jet lag. \nPhotographs\
  \ and movies cannot prepare you for the city that is Paris. The Arc was far more\
  \ impressive than I had expected. The detailed artwork chiseled into the enormous\
  \ monument are startlingly impressive. I climbed the 284 step spiral staircase up\
  \ the Arc to the top. The stunning view was well worth the climb. You can see the\
  \ whole city up there with the Eiffel Tower in own corner and the the Sacr\xE9-Couer\
  \ in another corner. It was windy but sunny and warm and I lingered for over an\
  \ hour taking in all that is Paris and mapping out my next adventures. \nThis was\
  \ just the first couple of hours of being in Paris; in a new country outside of\
  \ my tiny little world. I was pushed to the edge of exhaustion exploring every nook\
  \ and cranny of the city I had dreamed of since I was a child. No words can express\
  \ the feeling of finally exploring a place you have revered for so long. My legs\
  \ and feet ached from all the walking, but seeing a new corner of the world was\
  \ worth it. This decision to finally do what I have always wanted to do has opened\
  \ up a new life for me."
