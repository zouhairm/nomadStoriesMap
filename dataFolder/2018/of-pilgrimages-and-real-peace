Text: "Ever since I deepened my yoga practice, the RIMYI (Ramamani Iyengar Memorial\
  \ Yoga Institute) has become a yearly pilgrimage of sorts for me. RIMYI is a microcosm\
  \ of the world (as most yoga institutes end up becoming).  I meet people from as\
  \ far away as Brasil and as close as Thane.  Such unlikely people as tennis players\
  \ to business tycoons to social workers.  Last year I went in the months of August\
  \ and September.  The chilly monsoons unleash themselves on the city during that\
  \ time...  \n\nI had been lucky to avoid getting drenched in Pune\u2019s sudden\
  \ downpours.  Until the day I went out for lunch and on my walk home the pleasant\
  \ drizzle steadily and surely grew into a monstrous torrent.  Too much for my little\
  \ umbrella to handle.  My capris were all wet as I pulled the umbrella low over\
  \ my head and waded through the veritable rivers that the streets had become.  As\
  \ I walked I noticed the cobbler was calmly trying to prevent his entire business\
  \ from being washed away in the rain.  I noticed the fruit and vegetable wallahs\
  \ covering their carts with waterproof tarpaulin sheets.  I noticed the coconut\
  \ bhaiyya had shut shop.  I crossed the road to the relatively dry sidewalk on the\
  \ other side.\n\nWhen I have the 7 am class I walk across someone sleeping on this\
  \ sidewalk.  This person is always wrapped head to toe in a blanket.  I\u2019ve\
  \ never seen him stirring in his sleep.  The early morning traffic doesn\u2019t\
  \ seem to bother him.  When it rains he props an umbrella up and hopefully it keeps\
  \ (at least) his torso dry.  Once when I was walking to class (in the middle of\
  \ the day) a yellow snake slithered out from the bushes and, perhaps realizing that\
  \ it had lost its way, slithered back into the bushes.  Slimy serpents don\u2019\
  t seem to bother this person.  I\u2019ve seen him there after a night of nonstop\
  \ torrential rain, after a hot and humid night, after the Ganpati celebrations,\
  \ on a Monday morning, on a Saturday morning\u2026\n\nTo renounce everything and\
  \ find peace in a remote cave in the Himalayas is easy.  To stay ethical and honourable\
  \ in the absence of temptation is no big deal.  If we want to quieten the spirit,\
  \ we must accept the noise that is creating the disturbances.  If we want some rest,\
  \ we must get it despite the traffic, fear of snakes, the rain or the heat.  If\
  \ we need to find peace, we must do so in the midst of chaos.  Wrapped in a threadbare\
  \ blanket under a tattered umbrella.  Because that\u2019s where we need it the most."
