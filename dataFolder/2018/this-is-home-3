Text: "Dominica.\n \nWe speak English and patois, and you\u2019re probably saying\
  \ the name wrong. It\u2019s Do-me-nee-ka.\n \nMy mother and I leave Dominica when\
  \ I\u2019m seven, visiting twice thereafter. Though we trade our green passports\
  \ for the blue one and my accent no longer labels me a foreigner, Dominica is home.\
  \ Granny and Papa have been waiting nine years, and I\u2019m excited about the photos\
  \ I\u2019ll take. It is May.\n \nThen Maria appears. With a force she charges across\
  \ our homeland, plucking every leaf off every branch and every branch from every\
  \ tree. \u201CIt\u2019s like there were demons in the wind,\u201D they later recount.\
  \ She peels back the roofs of people\u2019s life savings, baring the state of their\
  \ mattresses. She leaves with the light, water, and the island\u2019s color. We\
  \ see images of our brown Dominica and listen as the death toll rises. It is September.\n\
  \ \nMy aunt finally calls, and my mother explodes. She can now exhale. Greenery\
  \ makes its slow return and the roads to our village are passable, my aunt informs.\
  \ Electricity is still months away and water inconsistent, but Dominicans celebrate\
  \ the small victories. They even find time to laugh above the hum of generators.\
  \ Jokes are funnier in patois. It is October.\n \nDominica receives us, and I hesitate\
  \ to acknowledge the damage. The drive from the airport affords time for confrontation,\
  \ but I hide in the backseat of an SUV. I see no coconuts, just years of progress,\
  \ undone. Nevertheless, the warmth reminds me of earlier times and the breeze still\
  \ speaks the same language. The roads narrow and wind as always and, nine years\
  \ later, terrify me less than before. Our village shrinks as it comes into view.\
  \ I can almost reach over the ravine and touch the pastor\u2019s house from the\
  \ top of my street. It is in plain sight, compliments of Maria. Her name arises\
  \ in daily conversation.\n \n\u201CMaria gave you a new number, huh?\u201D\n \n\
  My mother distracts herself with the new brick houses and drivable roads where there\
  \ were once trees and dirt paths.\n \n\u201CWhose house is that?\u201D\n \n\u201C\
  Wow, it\u2019s so nice there! So many houses.\u201D\n \nThough not ideal, we enjoy\
  \ our time home. My mother makes passion fruit juice one night, and and we occasionally\
  \ savor some our favorite island cooking. Most importantly, we spend time with our\
  \ family, and they with us. Between expressions of joy and pensive silences, Papa\
  \ speaks.\n \n\u201CThese are wonderful and beautiful words I\u2019m telling you.\u201D\
  \n\n\u201CAll that I\u2019m telling you is righteousness! Take it or leave it.\u201D\
  \n\nI take it. This is home. It is December."
