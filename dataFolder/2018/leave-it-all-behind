Text: "Everyone come across a point in their life, where they can't lead the same\
  \ lifestyle. So everyone has to leave it all behind to discover yourself, to know\
  \ who you are and to know what are you made of. I came across the same point where\
  \ I couldnt help myself but fell tired, tired of the predictability that was there\
  \ everyday in my life, the same people, the same street and the same street. I always\
  \ used to think that there should be something more out there, my heart and soul\
  \ was aching for adventure, but as you know it is so easy to ignore these feelings,\
  \ its so easy to escape reality. But one day when I was alone in my room, these\
  \ feeling returned to me, the need for the adventure in my life, to discover something\
  \ out there not to prove someone but for myself.  I couldnt ignore these feelings\
  \ anymore, I needed a change, I needed an adventure and I had to go somewhere far,\
  \ where I didnt know anybody. But in this mordern day society, people will always\
  \ criticize you not for doing what they wanted they will ask you questions, what\
  \ did you gain?\nWhy you left?\nI'll answer why, why I left.\nIn this life, we run,\
  \ we run behind other for success  without knowing where we are going, without realizing\
  \ that he path we choose is the one we choose or the one that society choose. Why\
  \ does this happen? Why? because we all are scared, we dont want take chances so\
  \ we settle for things that are not bad. We should not be afraid if our path looks\
  \ different from other people. \nWhen you all leave it behind and focus on things\
  \ that we want to do rather than focusing on what other people want us to do. Once\
  \ you're out of your comfort zone, you will change, you will grow. Once you return\
  \ home everything will be same but you will be different.\nWhen I set out on a journey,\
  \ I didnt know where I would end up or what I would do there, but I had courage\
  \ to do so. There was so much out there, so much culture, traditions and places\
  \ to visit. Everyone might think that leaving is the hardest but you're wrong, the\
  \ hardest step is coming back home. Leaving the place that changed your life, leaving\
  \ the people who change your perspective about life, leaving the places that you\
  \ wont ever forget in your life and saying goodbyes to the people who made you realize\
  \ that there is some much out there to discover rather than sitting in home and\
  \ watching TV. \nIts traveling that sets you apart from those other people, its\
  \ traveling that helps you realize that you deserve more in life."
