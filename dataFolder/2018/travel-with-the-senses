Text: "Indira rode on the back of an elephant and explained the texture was rough\
  \ and the hair of the animal felt like a wire, but she sensed confidence, so much\
  \ love from her new friend that now every time she remembers, just smile.\n\nShe\
  \ flew across three continents and finally arrived in Thailand and submerged herself\
  \ in the daily life of Bangkok, swam in the waters of the Andaman Sea once in Phuket,\
  \ and enjoyed a different walk on the back of an elephant in Chian Mai, in addition\
  \ she tasted all the fabulous local gastronomy, not only in restaurants but also\
  \ in the street food stands. She spoke with taxi and tuk-tuk drivers, bargained\
  \ with street vendors, distilled all her beautiful vibe through Thailand and came\
  \ back radiant, sharing her experience.\n\n\nIndira suffers pigmentary retinosis\
  \ since she was eigthteen, and over time has lost the ability to see colors, faces\
  \ and letters, now only distinguishes clear objects on dark backgrounds and vice\
  \ versa, but the light in her eyes is there,as well as the eager to taste diverse\
  \ dishes, a good wine, to eating a delicious chocolate and the desire to live. She\
  \ is one of my favorite people and I am proud to say she is my friend, she always\
  \ has the batteries charged, she is willing to undertake any adventure, to take\
  \ airplanes and fly around the world, to laugh out loud, to enjoy her life, and\
  \ then she climbed on the back of an elephant in Thailand and went out for a walk.\n\
  \nWhen I asked her about the food, she remembered the crunchy bites, the spicy sauces,\
  \ the sweetness of Khao tom, the taste of coconut water and she revels in remembrance.\
  \ She talked about the smell of each place, explained the elephant smelled bad,\
  \ that the salty aroma of the beaches is unique. Also described bargaining as a\
  \ fantastic activity, made a kind of rafting on wooden boards in a river. She could\
  \ not have visual appreciation, but she experienced an extraordinary journey full\
  \ of unparalleled flavors, smells, sounds and sensations.\n\nEvery time I get through\
  \ some adversity, that I feel like, Michael Ende\xB4 style, if the Nothing is coming;\
  \ I think about Indira, her completeness, her desire to enjoy, her contagious laughter,\
  \ her particular ways of speaking; she gives me a little of her endless batteries\
  \ and I follow the path. As well as Thailand, there are a thousand stories of her\
  \ trips, but the one at the back of an elephant, marked me in such a way that it\
  \ is her most narrated adventure, at least for me. I share the fortune of her friendship."
