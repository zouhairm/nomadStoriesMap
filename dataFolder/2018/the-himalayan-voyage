Text: "Coming from a military background, penchant for travel and adventure has been\
  \ my part and parcel since childhood. I was always enthralled to listen to the endless\
  \ tales of my father and his friends about the long treks in Himalayas, Para jumping\
  \ from 10,000 ft or sailing in the rough seas. While there was still time for us\
  \ to get busy as a professional engineer, we decided to undertake an all boys trip\
  \ to experience something which we were most scared of. After much debate we decided\
  \ on a bike trip to Leh through Manali which would not only test our physical stamina\
  \ but also give us an opportunity to do things which we wanted to but always refrained\
  \ from self-imposed fear of vertigo. \n Two days in Manali was nothing but adrenalin\
  \ all along. Parasailing amongst the surreal Himalayas and cable car ride at Solang\
  \ Valley, treks to some of the highest mountains around and rock climbing were some\
  \ of the activities that took away that \u2018Vertigo\u2019. Rohtang pass and view\
  \ from the top was like heaven on earth. We continued with the bike trip to Leh\
  \ over next two days along the deepest gorges I have ever seen. The highest motorable\
  \ pass on the earth at KhardungLa, Pangang Tso lake and its clear water (one got\
  \ to see to believe), the barrenness of the mountains around, the Magnetic Hill,\
  \ etc; were all so fascinating. \n It was not only the adventure aspect that was\
  \ notable of this voyage. Warmth and hospitality of the locals; be at Manali, Leh\
  \ or enroute during the bike journey, was just amazing. I can still feel the taste\
  \ of the local cuisine of Dham and red rice \u2013 one of the most delicious meals\
  \ I ever had. Their traditional outfit \u2018Pattu\u2019, folk dances and some of\
  \ the wooden crafts is indeed fascinating. There was so much to do in so little\
  \ a time. The experience was too exhilarating to push us to the edge of our physicals\
  \ but at the same time remains the most memorable.  I wish it could continue forever."
