Text: "Almost every day when I took the beach road, I could see an old grey-bearded\
  \ man selling handmade accessories. Since I am thrilled with the accessories, especially\
  \ if they are hand crafted, I enjoyed passing by the old man and carefully looking\
  \ at all the handmade goodness he had on the table. Once I haven\u2019t seen him\
  \ at his common spot, there was a girl in the glasses. I approached her and asked\
  \ for the prices of some accessories. There was one necklace that I looked at every\
  \ day. Happily anticipating new purchase, I ran back home to take some money, however,\
  \ when I came back, the old man was already sitting on his usual place and crafting\
  \ new accessories. He turned out to be an artist and a very philosophical man (I\
  \ love philosophical conversations!), thus I sat near him and we started talking\
  \ about the life under gorgeous Cretan starry sky. In the end of our conversation\
  \ he said \u201CYou know, Alisiia, you are that special person the necklace was\
  \ waiting for. Please take it, now it\u2019s yours.\u201D I was astonished. Since\
  \ that day we became friends. Days were changing, every day I have geeted the old\
  \ man sitting next to the beach road and we were not strangers anymore. Sometimes\
  \ I was sitting down on a small old wooden chair next to him and listened to his\
  \ stories. One day I had a big conflict with my manager at work. I had conflicts\
  \ with him even before but that day he greatly offended me and I decided that I\
  \ am not going to work at that hotel any longer. I approached him after the end\
  \ of shift and quitted. That summer Greece faced a big crisis and we were not paid\
  \ on time so that neither I had money nor place to stay for several days. I didn\u2019\
  t even notice how I came to the old man and started crying. He suggested me to stay\
  \ at his place for a while. That night I packed my things, we sat at his old motorcycle\
  \ and drove up to the mountains. He lived quite poorly in a small white house full\
  \ of different paintings and statues that he made by himself. He fetched me some\
  \ kefir and sandwiches for the dinner. At night we were talking on different topics\
  \ and early in the morning he had to leave to the beach. He literally saved my life.\
  \ Eventually I came home, but I remember that summer as a magical experience that\
  \ introduced to me open-hearted people. I still keep that special necklace in my\
  \ casket..."
