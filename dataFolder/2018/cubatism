Text: "Broken and kicked out of my mansion. Thirteen years of committed relationship\
  \ with a gay man. Where do I go from here? \n\nPicked up drinking with a beautiful\
  \ man named Wally with a tattoo cross with Jesus Christ on his chest....she pulls\
  \ me away from him and says we leaving to Cuba. \"Nally! Lets go!\" \n\nI am stripped\
  \ away by my stripper friend Diamond taking me away for this vacation. I was not\
  \ ready to go and didn't even really want to go at this point cause I think Im in\
  \ love with love of my life....Wally! \n\nDiamond says \"Nally, you not in love...shut\
  \ up lets go?\"\n\nAll I remember is that I was pretty drunk flying to Cuba. Waking\
  \ up in Cuba completely sober, I say \"How the heck did I get here?\"\n\nWell might\
  \ as well have fun...because we are here. CUBA. Ready to dance.\n\nI reach with\
  \ my packed bags previously packed by my dad and cousin. Sunglasses and couple cervasos\
  \ and I was back in Sunlight sensation. \n\nWe unpack and prepare our holidays in\
  \ class at the Valentin Santa Maria. It was beautiful exposures to the water ahead.\
  \ \n\n\"Lets go to the beach.\"\n\nWe swim, dance and party for our first night\
  \ in Cuba. They totally put me on stage and I dance the night away. Meeting and\
  \ treasuring the new memories. \n\nDiamond started getting mad when ever Nally would\
  \ socialize without her. After a blissful week of beach and pool side drinks. Wine\
  \ dine entertainment and shows. \n\nDiamond decides to go skinny dipping in the\
  \ night with group of tourists. Nally wants nothing to do with it but sit and sulk\
  \ with this beautiful guy named Fredrick she met on beach. \n\nDiamond gets jealous\
  \ of Nally sitting with this beautiful man  and runs over and starts punching Nally.\
  \ Nally tells Diamond if she hits her more than 10 times she will hit her back.\
  \ \n\nNally was highly trained martial arts and hit Diamond once to stop her. Diamond\
  \ is backed up by bunch of people seriously hurt...while Nally is sky high ready\
  \ to drop kick her. \n\n\"They yelled stop!\"\n\nNally yells \"I was crying already.\
  \ Why would you hit me?\"\n\nDiamond decided that she was flying back home the next\
  \ day with out Nally and was gonna take her passport with her. Nally reconciles\
  \ with Diamond for her passport. \n\nNally decided to leave room for two days to\
  \ return to her empty room without Diamond. With one week left Nally decides to\
  \ make the best of her week accomplishing her goals. \n\nDiamond leaves letter.\n\
  \n\"Im sorry I set you up. I just knew you needed the time on your own. Take the\
  \ best of this vacation to be happy!\""
