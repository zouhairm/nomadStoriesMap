Text: "My hands clenched the reigns in terror as my camera rolled down the lush green\
  \ mountainside. He acted quickly, dashing down the mountain without hesitation leaving\
  \ us and the horses to fend for ourselves.\n \nWhat began as a quest to photograph\
  \ the world\u2019s tallest palm trees in their most concentrated location, Colombia\u2019\
  s Cocora Valley, later turned into a race between my tumbling DSLR and our local\
  \ guide Jaime.\n \nAs we ascended the trail Jaime explained today wasn\u2019t an\
  \ ordinarily sunny day. Noticing a grin, I assumed his love of the valley knew no\
  \ weather prejudice. I became jealous of his ability to see past the gloomy clouds\
  \ overhead since I knew they would degrade the quality of my photos. To him, every\
  \ day garnered a new appreciation for this majestic site. To me, I couldn\u2019\
  t have picked a worse day to visit.\n \nWe reached the summit after nearly an hour\
  \ on horseback. Wax palm trees towered nearly 200 feet covering the valley like\
  \ sprinkles on a cupcake, some so close your neck strained to get a glimpse of the\
  \ branches above. I reveled in the foggy mist brushing against my cheeks as Jaime\
  \ spoke of fond childhood memories playing soccer in Salento, a nearby town perfect\
  \ for a lunch of patacones, trucha and milo.\n \nJaime kindly kept to the horses\
  \ as I sat with my camera impatiently awaiting the clouds to part. Now was my chance\
  \ for a splendorous wax palm display as the focal point of my afternoon photoshoot,\
  \ or so I had hoped. Dark shadows overtook the gently swaying army of palms surrounding\
  \ us. \n\nHalf an hour later, frustrated and disappointed, I packed my equipment\
  \ and saddled up the horse. My 2,500-mile journey to Cocora Valley culminated with\
  \ lackluster photos at best.\n \nI felt a lump in my throat as the camera slipped\
  \ from my hands just minutes into our descent. The thought of losing those images\
  \ for which I had so eagerly awaited, no matter how poor quality they likely were,\
  \ was a sinking feeling. Dreams of inspiring others through my travel photography\
  \ were unraveling as I sat atop the horse and watched Jaime disappear over the mountainside.\n\
  \ \nAfter what felt like a lifetime, a light tan poncho appeared, grass-covered\
  \ and dirty. Out of breath and mud-stained, Jaime approached and handed over my\
  \ dusty camera with a smile. He saved something so precious to me, but it was his\
  \ graciousness in doing so that left me with much more. There I sat, bitter and\
  \ upset about the weather. There he stood in the land he loved and had never left,\
  \ smiling."
