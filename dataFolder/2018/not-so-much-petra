Text: "I was standing in the border control and my soul was a dark shade of an enraged\
  \ green. My passport had been denied, so after much anticipation and poor planning\
  \ I wasn\u2019t allowed to go on the tour to Petra with my friend after all. It\
  \ was my first time in Eilat, the southernmost city of Israel and I was feeling\
  \ sandy. \u201CI think I\u2019ll go then, see you when we come back!\u201D My unremorseful\
  \ friend was ready to leave me behind making awkward small talk with Eilat when\
  \ I wanted to hang out with sophisticated exotic Petra. Through the arid air I saw\
  \ him and the other giddy tourists walking towards Jordan. A few minutes later I\
  \ was being taken back to the center by a jolly Israeli man on his van that read\
  \ \u201Cfun time\u201D in bold letters across the sliding doors. Not enough to put\
  \ me in a good mood.\n\nWith a day to spare I decided to head to the beach, so after\
  \ grabbing a book and a towel from the hostel I went back outside where the sun\
  \ was still shining with annoying aggression. As I walked down a wide avenue splashed\
  \ by palm trees and disappointment, I knew I was never to come back to that place\
  \ again. Downtown, the vibrant hotels and shops added a flashy tone to the desert\
  \ landscape. Shiny items were being sold in stalls, music and incense welcomed passersby.\
  \ At one point, the surroundings were so ostentatious that the falafel stands were\
  \ my only reminders of where I was. That, and the eternal presence of the red mountains\
  \ looking after me in the background.\n\nAt the beach, I settled on a stripy chair\
  \ perfect to satisfy my new plan of laying in the sun all day hoping my skull would\
  \ burn just enough so that I could wallow in my own bitterness. But by the time\
  \ I found myself swimming in the bluest Red Sea, marveling at the colorful fish\
  \ that swarm in the coastline of that coral reef area it was pretty obvious I had\
  \ tragically failed to extend my cynicism throughout the afternoon. Only as the\
  \ sun went down I began to take in the lovely January summer day that was upon me.\
  \ I gazed at the mountains beautifully glued to the horizon not so far away. They\
  \ were now showing their brightest red as the sun light was disappearing. I thought\
  \ I needed to take a snap of that moment, but the moment was keeping my feet in\
  \ the sand, my skin comfortably embraced by the warmth of the sea. In the mountain\u2019\
  s heavenly hue I found the most surprising reflection of hopefulness. Evidently\
  \ I would want to go back the next day to see it once more."
