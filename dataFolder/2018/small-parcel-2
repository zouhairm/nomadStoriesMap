Text: "Crisp. The air was aggressively cold yet firm on my cheeks. It enveloped across\
  \ my body, entwined around each follicle on my skin, hooking into my bones. Hurriedly\
  \ around me, bodies shuttled back and forth, bustling the roads as we all went about\
  \ our chaotic lives, passing each other by. I closed my eyes, feeling the slither\
  \ of warmth from the Sun, kissing my nose delicately. The universe was kind to me\
  \ this day, I felt a stronger energy overshadowing me, giving me a purpose that\
  \ warmed me from within. I\u2019d caught myself lost in the masses for a moment,\
  \ in this new city, alien environment, yet familiar and resonate, quickly snapping\
  \ myself back into the present and refocusing back on my path.\nAs I crept down\
  \ each step, the thudding sound of bass drizzled through my surroundings, intensifying\
  \ as I furthered the bottom. Energy oozed so tremendously it soaked the very walls\
  \ of the studio that evening, pulling me into the current, itching myself to unleash\
  \ into its force. \nDefeated and flustered, I dragged my feet towards the cubicle\
  \ and allowed the steam to encompass me as it bled through my pores. The hot droplets\
  \ of water dribbled down my physique, racing and painting a path, as if to guide\
  \ me to a focus. The warmth I felt in my abdomen began to intensify, from comforting\
  \ to unavoidable. The piercing notions grew faster and thicker, longer and lengthier\
  \ with each stride. The feeling of a fist tightening inside of me pounded louder\
  \ than my drowning wails, as I retreat into myself, confused and helpless. I lay\
  \ in a foetal position, reluctant to open my eyes, selfishly, yet unable to stop\
  \ myself. \nAs rouge droplets bounced themselves off of one another, I thought of\
  \ the bustling masses I encountered daily, that I became trapped in. In those moments\
  \ I\u2019d find myself becoming distracted or searching for resonation, as if by\
  \ the burning Sun or the opal Moon. Isn\u2019t it strange, despite the thousands\
  \ of surroundings, there is always one pull to each individual\u2019s gravity, one\
  \ focus. I laid my face into the clear droplets of water, admiring as the red droplets\
  \ encircled the small parcel next to me, allowing the water to blanket over my numb\
  \ shell. You glared a bright light, pure, captivating. Your momentary passing was\
  \ ethereal and inescapable all at once. Your presence bound itself to my core within\
  \ that second, with no explanation, I knew it was you and I knew you would never\
  \ leave my side. An unspoken promise as we lay together, clear to rouge droplets,\
  \ bound."
