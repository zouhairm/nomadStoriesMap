Text: "The last thing I expected was to plop onto my bed and cry at the end of the\
  \ day. This became the norm after long days of volunteering in the outskirts of\
  \ Siem Reap, Cambodia. It was the start of my four month trek around southeast Asia\
  \ and I wanted to \u201Cdo good works\u201D by spending some time volunteering.\
  \ I wanted to learn about the community while helping those in need. Little did\
  \ I know, the locals and program coordinators were going out of their way to make\
  \ me comfortable and happy. Wasn\u2019t it supposed to be the other way around?\
  \ The last thing I expected from volunteering abroad was to feel so disconnected\
  \ from a community when I was just looking in from the outside. \nIn the fall of\
  \ 2014, I volunteered for six weeks as a soccer coach at NGOs near Siem Reap. I\
  \ was athletic, liked kids, and was well-traveled; I was completely qualified and\
  \ I wanted to make the world a better place. \nYet, who was I, a young, privileged,\
  \ white, college educated American, to come and think that I could really make an\
  \ impact on a community in which I couldn\u2019t even communicate? Was I better\
  \ than the other backpackers who just wanted to party? It hit me after the first\
  \ week that I was way in over my head. Each day, after running around the dirt fields\
  \ with adorable little barefooted children, I would go back to my cozy guest house\
  \ that had air conditioning, WIFI, and a mini fridge. I was devastated. What was\
  \ I doing there? Why did I get my own private housing with drywall, locked doors,\
  \ and a pool, when locals were selling street food, walking around limbless, and\
  \ sleeping under thatched roofs? \nHowever, I needed to make the most of my time\
  \ volunteering abroad. The history and poverty of Cambodia was beyond my control.\
  \ Maybe the reason I was there was to realize that my daily stresses were minimal\
  \ compared to people in other countries. \nI wanted to make the most of my service\
  \ abroad and have fun with the kids on the soccer field. My goal was to bring them\
  \ a smile, be goofy, and get messy in the mud. If anything, I could at least brighten\
  \ their day. I was lucky to take advantage of a unique opportunity in a new culture.\
  \ \nI never expected that volunteering abroad would be such an emotional challenge.\
  \ Yet, it was extremely humbling. In no way do I discourage volunteering abroad,\
  \ but a brief service will not sustain communities. Although I went in naive, volunteering\
  \ in Cambodia helped me realize how blessed I was to have an opportunity to play\
  \ sports with kids across the world."
