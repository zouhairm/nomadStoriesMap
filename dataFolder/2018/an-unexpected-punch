Text: "The air grew warmer as I was climbing the road. I walked with both determination\
  \ and apprehension: today will be my first Muay Thai lesson.  I stopped a second\
  \ to watch the sun cresting the sea and observe the sea gently gaining ground over\
  \ the golden beach. I walked along the closed shops, the empty restaurants, the\
  \ street was quiet and I was enjoying the sleeping island more than ever before.\
  \ \nBy the time I got there the excitation reached his peak. I could see the outdoor\
  \ installation, two Thai men in loose-fitting shorts were talking and lucky me \u2013\
  \ just one other trainee. I introduced myself to one of the instructors. \u201C\
  How old are you?\u201D he asked. \u201CMy name is Tuk\u201D. After pointing the\
  \ jump ropes, he connected his phone to the speakers, put a youtube mix and set\
  \ the alarm. The lesson was officially beginning.\nThe air felt heavier and I was\
  \ breathing with difficulty. The alarm rang, we all met at the center and Tuk swaddled\
  \ my hands meticulously with smelling hand wraps, while I was acknowledging his\
  \ superb shape. Followed a long series of basics punch and kicks. The music, grunting\
  \ and thumping knocked my mind in rhythm. Each break was a relief, and drinking\
  \ water was reinvigorating, drying up the desert of my body. \nThen he showed me\
  \ how to raise my knee to block his kicks. My muscles were sore and it was difficult\
  \ to concentrate. In that exact moment, I received my first kick. My body instantly\
  \ got tougher and prepared for the next to come. I reacted quicker the next time,\
  \ but on the wrong side. \u201CFocus\u201D he shouted. \u201CStay here\u201D. The\
  \ other trainee was now vomiting, crouched down at the edge of the room.\nTuk was\
  \ smiling. Why was he smiling? I wanted it to be over.  My body was covered in sweat\
  \ and the matted floor was bouncing below my step. \nMaybe it was to avoid disappointing\
  \ him, or myself, but I resisted my urge to run away. As I was getting better in\
  \ the combos, I felt more confident. The pain, the heat and the dizziness were still\
  \ there, but the noisy self-doubt scourging in the back of my head was gradually\
  \ fading.\nI laid down exhausted, almost crying of liberation when Tuk grabbed my\
  \ knees and asked me to do fifty sit-ups. Power spread through each of my cells,\
  \ completely taking over the pain. After a few stretches, I went back to the counter\
  \ and signed up for a 12 lessons package. I put back my shoes, my cap, got down\
  \ the hill until I reached the previous spot with the sea view. The sun was now\
  \ higher, the heat stronger, and I smiled."
