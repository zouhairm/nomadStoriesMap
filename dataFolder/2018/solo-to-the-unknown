Text: "It all started with no friends in new city. What do i do now? Well, spent lazy\
  \ hours alone but couldn't continue all alone everyday. I need to have a break from\
  \ this type of routine. No Friends = No life, is what my old city friends told.\
  \ But i proved them Wrong very Early.\n\nEvery Roadtrip i make, Every Trek, Every\
  \ Explore to new cities i make, i just enjoy it less crowded and infact ALONE is\
  \ the only  best possible way to explore both new city and new me in a different\
  \ place.\n\nThe days rolled over and it always take some time to start off with\
  \ new things. It was very difficult at initial stages to manage each and everything\
  \ in a new place singly, never the less it thought me how to adopt and overcome\
  \ the situations which were quite bad at intial days. \n\nFirst trip, i remember\
  \ i had nothing except clothes. I just hook up on a train on a general seat. Even\
  \ the destination wasn't known ;) all i wanted was to travel to some place and relax\
  \ for a while. I travelled around 680kms from my place for the first time to the\
  \ unknown trek which captured beautifull moments of my Life.\n\nIts been since then\
  \ i never tell someone about my plans to a destinations as i want to make it solo\
  \ ;) and get the inner me explore.\nIts been 3 years where i started with these\
  \ things and now i am the one person who has covered 3/4th of the nation alone.\n\
  \nPeople ask me \"how will you manage these things?\" and \"Y do you travel ALONE\"\
  \nIts just \"A decision that pushed me to the edge\" i answer them all.\n\n-Solo\
  \ Traveller"
