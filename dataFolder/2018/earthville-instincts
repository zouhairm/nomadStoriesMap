Text: "A high-pitched, defiant, female voice, filled the dormitory, as I frantically\
  \ yelped and jumped, gushing at the sight of my newly discovered roommate, an eight-legged\
  \ creature crawling up my bed side.\n\nMr. Rajinder, glanced with alarm, through\
  \ an open window, from the other building. He was the local caretaker, of the institute\
  \ where I was volunteering through summer. He hastily ran up to the dormitory. \"\
  Did anyone get hurt?\", he asked in an anxious voice, whilst catching his breath.\
  \ \n\nTanvi, a dorm-mate, pointing at the open window, and covering up a faint chuckle\
  \ uttered, \"They are here again. She's come here today, she'll get used to it.\"\
  \ Mr. Rajinder looked at me, then at the open window.\n\nA light, breezy drift of\
  \ evening air came in escorting unusual insects and our invader, the spider. \"\
  This is common up here in the mountains. They never bite\", he mentioned; hoping\
  \ it would bring respite. Noticing that my guise hadn't faded, and my gaze was focused\
  \ on the wall, he picked up the broom and climbed up to the upper bunk. He waved\
  \ it around in a carefree manner aiming at the insects on the ceiling. Seeing this,\
  \ Tanvi burst into laughter and I couldn't control mine either. He laughed back\
  \ at us, happy to see my fear had been concealed. He picked up the spider with one\
  \ leg and threw it out of the window, before closing it. I slept in peace that night.\n\
  \nA week into my earthship, I was moving amidst nature, my hands wet in mud and\
  \ dung.  Rajinder Bhaiya, as everyone fondly called him, was an in-house favorite,\
  \ skillfully teaching us how to make fiber ropes, cutting the right length of bamboo\
  \ and even cooking, as he woke up at 4.a.m to make everyone breakfast. I would rise\
  \ early to capture daybreak, and helping cook would charge me up, while I waited.\
  \  He was so full of energy even in the mornings as he cheerfully told me tales\
  \ from everyday life in the Himalayas.\n\nOn a weekend trek once, to the higher\
  \ slopes, we stopped at a point to relax. As I lay on the grass, staring up at clear,\
  \ blue sky above my head, I spotted a para-glider, way above, smoothly sailing through.\
  \ My gaze fixated, just when Rajinder Bhaiya called out to me, \"You might want\
  \ to watch out for that spider next to you\". I was so lost, I didn't hear him and\
  \ probably didn't feel the spider crawl up my arm either. As Tanvi narrated the\
  \ incident later, to everyone over dinner, I looked at Rajinder Bhaiya and he grinned\
  \ back at me, and we both knew how much I'd grown from the first day I was here!"
