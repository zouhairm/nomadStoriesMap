Text: "I used to visit South Cotabato only in the dusty corner of my childhood memories.\
  \ If not for my aunt who flew back from America, visiting my mother\u2019s hometown\
  \ would have been moons away. I hated boat trips and long bumpy bus rides so the\
  \ thought of going did not excite me. Fortunately, we went by plane.\nBoth excitement\
  \ and indifference permeated the atmosphere as the passengers slowly swarmed out\
  \ of the cabin. I, too, felt the same for no melodramatic reasons. Stepping out\
  \ of the plane, I drank some air \u2013 it was warm.\nMy uncle fetched and drove\
  \ us to our aunt\u2019s house where we would be staying. It\u2019s been a decade\
  \ since I last saw my uncle that hugging him felt awkward. From the car, I saw mountains\
  \ close enough to notice they're bald. I looked around for some familiar traces.\
  \ But memory didn\u2019t guide me through the vacant fields that welcomed us. \n\
  When we reached Apopong, familiar episodes sparked \u2013 air seasoned with salt\
  \ and grains of sand sticking in between my toes when I stepped onto the \u201C\
  Welcome\u201D mat at the door. That day ended with a feast of roasted turkey and\
  \ funny stories. Surprisingly, the turkey was as delicious as my mother\u2019s laughter.\
  \ \nDays passed and my vacation metamorphosed into a colorful kaleidoscope of experiences.\
  \ From trips to white sand beaches in Gumasa, pineapple plantations in Saranggani\
  \ and the seven falls in Lake Sebu to night strolls in metropolitan GenSan, I was\
  \ reintroduced to South Cotabato. It was nothing like the pictures in our photo\
  \ albums. The metropolitan area was perfectly outlined with the rustic features\
  \ of the outskirts. There were both pollution and fresh air, busy streets and abandoned\
  \ valleys, noisy bars and silent shorelines.\nThen I began to develop an uncanny\
  \ accent which I used to find laughable. People here spoke a mixture of Tagalog,\
  \ Bisaya and Ilonggo dialects. The creole was marked with numerous code-switching\
  \ that I oftentimes misunderstood their statements. I remembered my first conversation\
  \ with the househelp, she asked if I\u2019d already eaten my breakfast in what seems\
  \ to me an exaggerated rising-and-falling intonation. I answered her in my Dumaguete\xF1\
  o accent. All I heard were monotonous words coming out of my mouth. I sounded too\
  \ lifeless. Soon, I started adapting their way of speaking. I was trying hard that\
  \ I may have sounded pretentious. But I continued imitating them, even their expressions.\
  \ It was more fun than funny \u2014 too addictive, even, that I had to unlearn it\
  \ when I went back to my hometown."
