Text: "In an ever-shrinking world \u2013 one that appears adamant on equating hashtags\
  \ with humanity \u2013 I unexpectedly found myself struggling to comprehend the\
  \ depth and breadth of the moment in which I, well, unexpectedly found myself. \n\
  \nThere I was, high up in the Andean Mountains of Medellin, Colombia, lounging fireside\
  \ with a belly full of Sancocho Paisa, surrounded by three intimidating generations\
  \ of Arbelaez matriarchs. Admirably strong and fiercely independent, I felt entirely\
  \ undeserving of their limitless warmth and hospitality. \n \n\u201CCheers Brendan!\
  \ To new friends! To new passions! To Colombia!\u201D\n\nTruth be told, the emotional\
  \ pendulum I would later describe as my previous 12 hours was weighing heavily on\
  \ my semi-concussed consciousness. What was supposed to be a quick 23-hour layover\
  \ in Medellin\u2019s \"digital nomad\" Mecca of barrio El Poblado, quickly evolved\
  \ into a cathartic reminder of the sacred rules of solo travel:\n \nRule #1: Don\u2019\
  t be that guy and pick a fight with locals (however morally justifiable).\nRule\
  \ #2: If you ignore Rule #1, look to acquire a loyal group of streetwise local friends.\n\
  Rule #3: If you ignore both Rule #1 and Rule #2, cover up your sensitive parts and\
  \ simply hope for the best.\n \nNeedless to say, Rule #1 and Rule #2 were ignored...\n\
  \nSuddenly prone, covering, and hoping for the best in the middle of downtown Medellin,\
  \ a miracle of the human condition mysteriously appeared at my side. Quickly demonstrating\
  \ the ferocity and warmth that would come to define my time with her family, Daniela\
  \ Arbelaez inexplicably came to the rescue of a gringo who should have known better\
  \ than to stick his fists (and his face) where they didn\u2019t belong. What followed\
  \ was an empowering and objectively comical journey to the outer reaches of empathy,\
  \ the likes of which I will be hard pressed to experience again.\n \nDry-cleaning\
  \ for my blood-stained clothing? Check. Doctor for the swelling in my face? You\
  \ bet. Friends, food, and ample amounts of Aguardiente to inebriate my spirit and\
  \ lift my soul? They wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer.\n \nOverlooking the city\
  \ below, my mind was more than a world away. As the hours began to slowly pass,\
  \ the jubilant hums of family and friends echoed deep into the abyss of the Aburr\xE1\
  \ Valley below. It was there, on the Arbelaez family farm, where I was gifted the\
  \ humbling opportunity to finally grasp the most basic truism of our time: \n\n\
  Only from beneath a canopy of stars can we truly appreciate the unexpected presence\
  \ of love."
