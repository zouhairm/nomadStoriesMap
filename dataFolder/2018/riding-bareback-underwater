Text: "Sea spray stings my eyes as our blue semi-inflatable boat flies over the waves\
  \ in the Indian Ocean. On the boat light conversation bubbles up on the most spectacular\
  \ moments we\u2019ve experienced under water, but for the most part silent concentration\
  \ settles over the ten of us. Our eyes painstakingly scan for members of the underwater\
  \ big five revealing themselves on the ocean surface, but the scorching Mozambican\
  \ sun makes it seem like it\u2019s been ages since we\u2019ve seen anything of interest.\n\
  \nThen all of a sudden someone breaks the silence.\n\n\u201CLook\u2026Whale!\u201D\
  \n\nQuickly the boat jumps into action. Mask on face, fins on feet, snorkel in mouth,\
  \ and camera in hand, we roll back off the boat and into the water. Our legs propel\
  \ us as fast as they can as we try and locate the whale under water before she dives\
  \ into the abyss and disappears. I take a moment at the surface to reorient myself.\n\
  \n\u201CAhhh!\u201D the dive master screams next to me. I look under water and coming\
  \ straight at me is the whale and apparently she also has a baby calf. \n\n\u201C\
  Oh snap!\u201D I think to myself, \u201CI\u2019m not the fastest swimmer.\u201D\n\
  \nAdrenaline surges through my body, as I will myself to swim faster than a 40-ton\
  \ marine mammal. By some miracle I get out of the way fast enough and manage to\
  \ have the cognitive sense to snap a picture of the mother whale\u2019s tail as\
  \ she swims away. Everything seems to move in slow motion as I take in the rhythmic\
  \ motion and power of her tail. I\u2019m simply in awe.\n\nWe quickly get back in\
  \ the boat and again try and maneuver ourselves in the front of the whale (but not\
  \ so close this time) so we can get the perfect picture. Again we enter the water.\
  \ The whale has not dove down as is typical.\n\nI look down into the deep water\
  \ and utter chaos ensues.\n\nFrom a distance my photography instructor sees it all\
  \ go down. Four girls swim directly in front of the whale. Then swim towards him\
  \ in a panic. He looks above the surface just in time to see the whale lift me out\
  \ of the water with the top part of her body where the barnacles are. A look of\
  \ absolute terror paints my face.\n\n\u201CHelp me! Help me!\u201D I belt out. I\
  \ feel like a giant surge of water pushes me forward. Out of panic I grab something\
  \ that feels like neoprene, but it\u2019s nobodies wetsuit.\n\nWe all quickly scramble\
  \ onto the boat as fast as we can. It is no longer safe. We book it out of there.\n\
  \nI have absolute respect for underwater photographers, capturing the photo is not\
  \ always as serene as it looks in a magazine."
