Text: "It dipped down, swooped across and out of sight. It vanished from my rearview\
  \ mirror and I never saw it again. It had appeared as subtly as it had disappeared.\
  \ A Red-tail Hawk gliding immaculately in America\u2019s forgotten land appropriately\
  \ named The Badlands of Montana.\n\nPursuing. Always pursuing it\u2019s own story.\n\
  \nWe are all chasing something and there is no turning back. At a certain point\
  \ you can only pray that the wind is favorable and hope is built to last.\n\nDid\
  \ the Native Americans of this vast land have hope when they realized the ambition\
  \ of the white man or did they feel hopeless and alone? I was alone\u2014driving\
  \ home from Portland to Chicago. My year long travels were ending and the truth\
  \ is I was no closer to answering\u2014what was I pursuing? As the sun was rising\
  \ upon this highway, I could see the light slowly fading under the horizon of my\
  \ future.\n\nVast jagged hills and cliffs, this land is the epitome of isolation\u2014\
  appearing entirely inhospitable. Yet these bone-white hills are adages of its everlasting\
  \ identity, one that has sculpted the lives of those that have passed through it\u2019\
  s gnarled clutches.\n\nHowever, this day\u2014my identity forever changed.\n\nYou\
  \ see, my whole life I have fervently believed that there is something more\u2014\
  something more profound if you keep looking. No matter how many warning signs on\
  \ the road or how defiant the current beats against you, the more prolific it is.\n\
  \nAdmittedly, I have never seen it and I don\u2019t know what it is. And the truth\
  \ is\u2014I was starting to question that notion. Every hour on this highway more\
  \ doubt was climbing through my spine and paralyzing me, leaving the world I knew\
  \ out of reach.\n\nMile marker after mile marker, I couldn\u2019t stop thinking\
  \ about the faces from the stories that this land has seen. They are and will forever\
  \ be in the dust of this American land. Their voices reverberate to remind us that\
  \ our existence is finite; our struggle, a privilege that may lead us to the ends\
  \ of the earth and challenge the very conviction that keeps our feet moving when\
  \ hope is lost.\n\nWhen I perceived the bedrock of my hope broken and lost without\
  \ a roadmap for the soul that I came upon an esoteric realization. That there is\
  \ no difference between the lost and the found. As much as we are of one, we are\
  \ equal parts the other. Engulfed in a inward journey that leads outward.\n\nOur\
  \ separate ventures all unique, but similar enough to remind us that we come from\
  \ the same dust and we forever remain part of the same dust."
