Text: "Most travelers desire to backpack hopping hostel to hostel, couch surfing,\
  \ or one of the many options for accommodations. However, my personal story brings\
  \ a unique cultural and life outcome. This event leads up to the arrival in Lima\
  \ through a special Venezuelan woman I grew close to in the last year, that flipped\
  \ my world upside down. This woman Oriana, lived in Caracas. Along with many other\
  \ Venezuelans, every day is a fight for survival. The scarcity of food, the violent\
  \ streets that haunt you around every block and the constant fear of being robbed\
  \ for the tiniest value. The people risk their lives every day to provide for their\
  \ families in the chaotic country. I invited her to visit in the United States,\
  \ in hopes to provide opportunities for her and into safety. We became closer in\
  \ the six months that she spent from her tourist visa, and a romantic relationship\
  \ soon blossomed. Spending six months together provided me an opportunity of growth,\
  \ which called us to make the next destination to move abroad. After weeks of research,\
  \ we came to the conclusion that Lima, Peru suited our conditions. Keep in mind\
  \ I grew up in the country so moving to Lima drastically changed my lifestyle. Although\
  \ backpacking is an incredible experience, living like a local has opened my eyes\
  \ to experiencing how life is. Life is not so glorified with this type of lifestyle,\
  \ from meeting a man on a bus who has schizophrenia with no support, Venezuelan\
  \ immigrants running from a dictatorship, to the everyday household family scraping\
  \ by to survive. One night, sounds of shattering glass, shouts and screams filled\
  \ the night\u2019s air. Two groups of men threw fists over a local soccer match.\
  \ Police arrived shortly and ended the night\u2019s brawl with gunfire rapidly shot\
  \ through the air. I realized the raw reality is not just Machu Picchu and the touristy\
  \ areas. Meeting Oriana has created an internal fire that desires deeply to connect\
  \ with people, assist and reach out to them, and lastly to publicly educate people\
  \ about living abroad locally. At this moment, San Miguel is teaching me something\
  \ new every day living as a local. Making a difference is what life is all about.\
  \ All I want is to learn as much as possible, understand people on a deeper and\
  \ local level, and to help make a positive impact. Hidden among every country\u2019\
  s beauty and main attractions, hides the working class cogs of society that makes\
  \ a country truly beautiful, which is the least expected part of traveling."
