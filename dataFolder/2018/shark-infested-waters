Text: "You can taste the salt in the Hawaiian air as we boarded the boat and set off\
  \ into the open ocean. We sailed into nothingness. However, there was no fear, there\
  \ was no anxiety. There was only pure bliss and serenity. We stopped in the middle\
  \ of the Ocean and I can feel the excitement starting in my toes and race through\
  \ my body. As I looked into the deep blue sea and saw the fin of the Galapagos shark\
  \ I smiled so big it hurt my cheeks. I rushed to put on my flippers and goggles.\
  \ I heard the voice of the diving instructor say, \u201CWho wants to go in first?\u201D\
  \ and faster than Katniss in hunger games volunteered herself to take the place\
  \ of her sister, I yelled \u201CMe!\u201D \nNext thing I know I was on the edge\
  \ of the boat; I looked up and saw the gorgeous lush mountains to my right. I then\
  \ looked in front of me and saw sharks swimming; they were patiently waiting for\
  \ my entrance into their world. I thought to myself, isn\u2019t it ironic that these\
  \ sharks are making me feel at peace while my home makes me feel on edge? But the\
  \ city, it can do that to you. Society rushes you into being an adult. However,\
  \ at 22 years old I was about to swim with Galapagos sharks in the open ocean in\
  \ a place commonly referred to as paradise. I knew I was not going to meet societies\
  \ standards. I was meant to explore places I have not yet seen and meet people I\
  \ have not yet meet. I was meant to dip my toes in the waters of the islands people\
  \ only dream of going too. It was not fate that led me to those shark-infested waters,\
  \ it was the conscious decision to experience life to the fullest. I have decided\
  \ that I do not want to be a bystander to those living their dream. \n\nI do not\
  \ want to live up to the expectations of society and that is perfectly okay."
