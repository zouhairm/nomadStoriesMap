Text: "India is known for its culture and colors & I have grown up perceiving the\
  \ same. In India, the idea of sending a girl on holidays is not much appreciated.\
  \ That's somehow weird but the reality, indeed. \n\nSo, how did I make my dream\
  \ come true? \n\nWhen I completed my high school, I decided to go on a short trip\
  \ to one of the seven wonders, Taj Mahal. Admittedly, I lied to my parents and escaped.\
  \ A few months later, I made a visit to Mcleodganj monastery in Himachal Pradesh.\
  \ And the next day I did my first trek ever to Triund. After camping for a night\
  \ when I came down back to Dharamshala, I had a sense of satisfaction. Those two\
  \ days turned out to be the glory days; I was in complete SATISFACTION. \n\nThree\
  \ months later I went on to explore more of my own country. I went to Bombay, riding\
  \ through the marine drive and drooling over the sea link. Within a week of coming\
  \ back to Delhi (My home), I left for Jaipur. Jaipur is called the \"pink city,\"\
  \ known for the famous historical places like Amer Fort, Nahargarh, Hawa Mahal and\
  \ almost all of Jaipur. India has a lot of fantastic must-visit historical spots.\
  \ My very next trip was to GOA, the place that lies in the heart of every India.\
  \ This was my second trip to goa, and it was different.  My scooter became my best\
  \ partner, and there was no stopping. I rode 120kms every day to explore every bit\
  \ of GOA. Though I am a nonalcoholic (not anymore), I tried all the alcohols of\
  \ Goa. The Goan man who had helped me when I fell off my scooter, the bartender\
  \ who stays in cruise for six months and does bartending in goa for the rest 6,\
  \ the Goan women earning through renting bikes, made me more confident of what I\
  \ am doing. \n\nNow I hardly obey my parents. I just travel. I wanted more, and\
  \ I decided to go international this time. It was Malaysia. There is a different\
  \ feel of standing inside the world's largest twin tower.  Few days in Kuala Lumpur\
  \ and then I visited Langkawi, the eagle island. Found the scooter there and went\
  \ on a long ride to explore the island. My idea to get on a jet ski tour is something\
  \ I am proud of. Traveling through more than 20 islands in Malaysia on a jet ski\
  \ was a next level experience. It's been a month, and I am still not over it. I\
  \ call that feeling \"SUKOON\" in Hindi (a sense of relief). \n\nA week from now\
  \ I will be in Pondicherry. Can't wait to explore more of my country. :) \n\nThe\
  \ decision to not obey my parents is one of the best decision of my life. :)"
