Text: "I came to Italy for the wolves.\n\u201CIt is cum\u2026 The person who makes\
  \ cum in your hair.\u201D\nIrene gestured at the name of the Italian street sign.\
  \ These particular streets in Rome are named after the people that worked on them.\n\
  \u201CYou know when you put cum through hair?\u201D\nShe ran her hand through her\
  \ thick black curls. Ah. Comb! This street was named after the people who made combs.\n\
  She explained how hard English can be to pronounce based on spelling. Her English\
  \ was exceptional compared to my ten Italian words I had learned.\nThis was my last\
  \ night with Irene, who had kindly allowed me to couchsurf in her apartment. Cities\
  \ are usually the last places on my list to visit. Rome was just the beginning of\
  \ this trip, but I loved it. Intricate and incredible buildings hidden around every\
  \ corner in this maze of high flat-like buildings covered in cloaks of wall climbing\
  \ plants.\nThe next morning I\u2019m weaving through the rugged snow-capped mountains.\
  \ Somehow, on the school bus. My knees crushed against the seat in front, the bus\
  \ burst with high pitched squealing. Animal noises included.\nSat in the cafe in\
  \ the central square of Pescasseroli, two stray dogs lay at my feet, the sun dipped\
  \ behind the mountain peaks.\nThey don\u2019t get many English tourists here. I\
  \ ask the waitress for an \u2018ostello\u2019. She shakes her head, smiles and takes\
  \ me to a cold, empty, boarded up hotel where an English and Italian speaking Iranian\
  \ woman made a phone call for me. There is a lot of laughter. She explained \u201C\
  I told Paula I have a beautiful man for her, but she says you can\u2019t be more\
  \ beautiful than her husband.\u201D\nPaula welcomed me into her home, putting the\
  \ heating on in my room for me.\n\u201CTomorrow, you meet Giuseppe.\u201D\nI was\
  \ immediately in awe of him. Rugged as the mountains with a warm comforting presence.\
  \ He was a wild man. An Italian Ray Mears who spoke no English. Three hours later,\
  \ I\u2019m at 2,500 meters, bitter winds biting my exposed hands, sat eating Giuseppe\u2019\
  s home made fried omelette bread. Alpine choughs calling, tree bark slashed by bear\
  \ claws and chamois proudly gazing from a high rocky outcrop emphasising how inadequately\
  \ evolved I am for this landscape. Along the sharp snowy ridge; wolf tracks.\nOn\
  \ my last night I hammocked, waking at 3am with my breathe frozen to the mesh cover,\
  \ wolf howls echoing through the valley. I found the wolves, and I found some wonderful\
  \ friends along the way. This year, I\u2019ll be visiting in Winter, when the wolves\
  \ hunt lower in the valleys."
