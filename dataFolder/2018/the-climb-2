Text: "My first warning sign should have been the stairs. Stairs are simple and safe,\
  \ but these continued winding through the ragged remains of trees after a long winter.\
  \ They seemed endless but it was hard to twist a knee with a handrail. When the\
  \ stairs finally finished, I had a moment of joy that I was almost to the peak.\
  \ It was easy to ignore the twinge in my knee. The air was fresh and cold and bracing.\
  \ I felt accomplished. \n Coming to Korea had been an opportunity to reinvent myself.\
  \ So I'd agreed to go with a colleague on a hiking trip. A small little mountain\
  \ north of Seoul\u2014it wouldn't be any longer than a day-trip, she'd told me.\
  \ Here, I had thought, was my chance to become the person who wasn't afraid of pain.\
  \ \n Then came the boulders. I was left alone to pull myself up and over boulders.\
  \ The twinge in my knee became a throb but I wanted to focus on the stinging in\
  \ my hands that gripped the rock too tight.\n When you've had chronic pain long\
  \ enough, there's always the memory of pain guiding all of your decisions. Before\
  \ the years of pain, I'd played soccer and done martial arts. I'd stepped off of\
  \ the curb without looking down. Even after knee surgery though, I was haunted by\
  \ the idea that one wrong move would send me into a series of doctors appointments\
  \ all undercut by a constant excruciating pain. I'd returned to life without constant\
  \ pain, but I didn't trust my body anymore.\n I finally reached the top of the boulders\
  \ and a path emerged. Here finally other hikers appeared. In South Korea, hiking\
  \ is one of the most popular hobbies but only the elderly had time to hike regularly.\
  \ By this point, the throbbing in my knee had turned to a persistent tenderness\
  \ and I knew without checking that my knee had swelled. I limped along, constantly\
  \ passed by people 40 years older than me. \n The path turned around the mountain\
  \ and what had been secure became nothing more than a narrow divot along a sheer\
  \ rock face with a sudden drop on the other side. This high on the path, winter\
  \ held on more securely and the path was filled with patches of ice and snow.  \n\
  \ I stepped out. I slipped. A grandfather rushed forward to help me up while an\
  \ elderly woman dusted me off. I wanted to give up. I wanted to say I had a bad\
  \ knee and I couldn't keep going. I gripped the rock-face again and stretched out\
  \ my knee. If you don't let yourself look back, then all you can do is continue\
  \ forward. I wasn't sure I could trust my body but I had to at least trust myself.\
  \ I continued forward."
