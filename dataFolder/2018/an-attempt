Text: "A stillness fell throughout Barcelona. It was 12 pm, everyone had stopped working\
  \ and were standing outside their buildings, the streets were closed and all public\
  \ transport had come to a halt. I observed the thousands of strangers surrounding\
  \ me with mute faces, a panic rose from deep within.\n\nLess than 24 hours ago,\
  \ merely 100 metres from where I stood, a white rental van had stormed into a pedestrian\
  \ area, killing 15 people and injuring over a hundred. An assault on what, until\
  \ this moment, had felt like a very safe city to visit and live in. \n\nThe local\
  \ police stood steady on every corner while King Felipe led a minute of silence.\
  \ Emerald statues of men and horses, stained with age, stood on guard of the crowd\
  \ occupying Pla\xE7a de Catalunya. \n\nFrom the distance, a deep noise built up\
  \ and rode on an invisible wave towards me. Everyone, including myself, began clapping\
  \ for those who lived the horror a day earlier, for the emergency services who had\
  \ shown their courage, and for the people who stood here today. \n\nThe applause\
  \ grew louder and louder, moving in waves, and initiated a movement in the crowd.\
  \ I had a choice, I could return to the comfort of my apartment or I could join\
  \ them in their march to reclaim one of the most popular streets of this city in\
  \ mourning, Las Ramblas.\n\nI chose to join them. \n\nA flow of people entered the\
  \ street under the heat of the midsummer sun, between the tall-plane trees they\
  \ strode forward. The usual smell of churros and cinnamon was replaced with the\
  \ salty breeze of tears, people held up flags and signs with messages of peace with\
  \ black ribbons. \n\nA woman in a crimson dress stood to one side, people formed\
  \ a circle around her, where someone had laid the day before. With her daughter\
  \ at her side, they placed blood-red roses on the ground.\n\n\u201CThank you for\
  \ your support,\u201D she yelled in Spanish, and the applause strengthened.\n\n\
  A curly-haired man with a face swollen with tears crossed the circle and hugged\
  \ her. A mix of languages and locals merged in embraces, we all stood together and\
  \ we wept. \n\nThere was an unmistakable air of loss, but chants began and grew\
  \ stronger as the people became more determined in their unity. A response to an\
  \ attempt to drive terror through the streets of Barcelona. \n\n\u201CNo tenim por!\u201D\
  \ the Catalonians shouted, with a power in their voices. \u201CNo tenemos miedo,\u201D\
  \ others said, and I participated, I agreed. There was solidarity, sorrow and strength\u2014\
  but there was no fear. \n\nWe are not afraid."
