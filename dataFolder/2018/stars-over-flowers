Text: "A plump brown chicken excitedly scurried across the courtyard, and vanished\
  \ into the hedges behind me. We arrived at the village homestay, after an eight\
  \ hour long drive from Mumbai. My rather petulant sister couldn't seem to understand\
  \ the appeal of a plateau blanketed in seasonal flowers and would rather watch YouTube\
  \ re-runs of some shrill cartoons. Kaas plateau, near the city of Satara, in the\
  \ state of Maharashtra, is famous for its seasonal blossoms that deck the plateau\
  \ in a myriad of colours. Lesser known than the popular Lonavala or Mahabaleshwar,\
  \ this place makes for a quiet weekend getaway for those that enjoy nature, fresh\
  \ air and rural life. \n\nThe sky blushed pink by the time we had reached. Entry\
  \ to the plateau was restricted in the evenings, so we had to wait until the next\
  \ day to explore it. It was late October, and the sky was getting dark quickly.\
  \ Due to the acute enthusiasm of my aforementioned sibling, we decided to pitch\
  \ the tent. We fumbled with groundsheets and torch lights in the dark, since the\
  \ village had a very limited supply of electricity. The neon pink tent stood out\
  \ in front of the earthy and rustic background. A village boy peeked from behind\
  \ the hedges, and stared at this novelty.\n\nMy father called out to greet him.\
  \ Though he was shy at first, soon enough the two were chattering away. Keen to\
  \ know more about our metropolis, he stayed and was enthralled by my father's descriptions\
  \ of Mumbai. Then, we decided to ask him about the flowers. \"No flowers now. Flowers\
  \ in August and September only!\" None of us expected that. We asked the owner of\
  \ the homestay, and he told us the same. My heart sank. What we had come for wasn't\
  \ there. I stared at the rolling hills as the sky turned black. No flowers. I couldn't\
  \ come to terms with it. \n\nThe silence was broken by the shrill voice of my sister\
  \ saying, \"Akka, look up!\" I complied, knowing that anything that takes her eyes\
  \ off the screen would be worth looking at. I was right. The sky was dotted with\
  \ thousands of stars. Entire constellations manifested themselves in the dark October\
  \ sky. Growing up in a polluted metropolis, the sky was always just a hazy black\
  \ quilt, but this, this was a spectacle. Each star was brighter than the next. I\
  \ still believe I saw entire galaxies from that village. It looked like a careless\
  \ child had spilled glitter powder over an expanse of black chart paper. I found\
  \ myself doing something completely unexpected- marveling at the sky, when I had\
  \ come for the earth."
