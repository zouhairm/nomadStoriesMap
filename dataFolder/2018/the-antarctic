Text: "The Dream\n\nHave you ever woken up from a dream and felt like you were still\
  \ in it? I opened my eyes and saw a bright white light pushing through my window.\
  \ I could see black rocks wrapped in white and it didn\u2019t make sense to me.\
  \ I was in a dream. I closed my eyes again. The next thing I remember was my roommate\
  \ asking me how was I still asleep\u2026that we were in Antarctica and I needed\
  \ to be outside. That moment felt like the falling sensation you have as you seep\
  \ into a dream and I jolted awake realizing those rocks were giant mountains and\
  \ that white wrapping paper was enormous glaciers. \n\nStill in a daze I grabbed\
  \ my camera and ran outside. I couldn\u2019t believe what I was seeing. The water\
  \ in the bay was perfectly still, reflecting back the most unreal scenery. Icebergs\
  \ were floating all around us and the water was so clear you could see the deep\
  \ blue hue from underneath. The sky was grey and dark but the amount of white encompassing\
  \ the land shined back and created this wildly surreal and soft light everywhere\
  \ around me. \n\nThe only sound I could hear was the soft hum of the diesel ship\
  \ engines. There was no smell. No trees or grass. Only white, black, and the oceans\u2019\
  \ deep blue. There were no buildings, nothing manmade in sight. I had no sense of\
  \ scale and as I spun around looking at all of the mountain peaks surrounding me\
  \ in awe, with no idea how big they were. Just massive dark spires in every direction\
  \ looming over the bay. I walked around the ship maybe fifteen times trying to soak\
  \ in every direction of newness. I took the same pictures as I moved from the starboard\
  \ to port side and back, feeling like I had never seen what I was looking at over\
  \ and over again. \n\nIf this isn\u2019t a dream, then dreams just got a lot less\
  \ exciting. I really had a hard time trying understand where I was\u2026at the bottom\
  \ of the planet\u2026in the windiest, coldest and driest place on earth. I walked\
  \ to the bow of the ship and stood looking out thinking about everything that lead\
  \ up to this moment and how thankful I was to be there. My friend Marcy, who I met\
  \ at the hostel the night before departure walked giddy with excitement, hopping\
  \ around exclaiming \u201Ccan you believe we are in Antarctica?!?\u201D. I looked\
  \ at her calmly and said, nope this isn\u2019t real. \n\nThis is what wild truly\
  \ is. Untamed, untouched and ever changing."
