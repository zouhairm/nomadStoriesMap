Text: "It\u2019s typically known as a mecca for rowdy backpackers, but Sihanoukville\u2019\
  s reputation belies its true beauty. What was I to expect? Perhaps a dilapidated\
  \ casino on every corner; revellers roaming the streets in a sun-stroke induced\
  \ daze.\n\nCouldn\u2019t we just hit the nearby smattering of off-shore islands,\
  \ idyllic Koh Rong or serene, electricity-free Koh Ta Kiev, already?\n\nInstead\
  \ I spent my days exploring miles of sprawling beaches, from laid-back Ochheuteal\
  \ to busy and boozy Serendipity, to the tranquillity of Otres 2.\n\nI was approached\
  \ one evening by a young girl selling bracelets. I\u2019d heard this would happen;\
  \ she was cuter than her older counterparts, and easier to succumb to.\n\n\u201C\
  Two for $3!\u201D she enthused, \u201COk, $2.\u201D\n\nHer name was Emma - though\
  \ I harbour doubts as to whether this was a Cambodian child\u2019s real name. Her\
  \ eyes coruscated with a charm somewhere between naivety and endearing assuredness\
  \ - no doubt her biggest bargaining tool.\n\nAfter two days, Emma\u2019s persuasive,\
  \ if not pushy, sales pitch subsided. Instead she'd finish school and run to find\
  \ me on the beach, letting out a delighted squeal, encasing me in a hug.\n\nEach\
  \ time she\u2019d bring a new friend, introducing me to them as though I was her\
  \ most prized possession: \u201CThis is my English friend, Ella.\u201D Her price\
  \ for a bracelet was now just $1 - an honour in itself.\n\nShe'd scold me for not\
  \ wearing sun cream; speak of the secluded, less-populated spots of her coastal\
  \ city; tell me that the best place to eat was from the thatch-roofed sea shacks\
  \ that lined the beach \u2013 the ones that wafted the scent of grilled fresh crab\
  \ and squid towards us.\n\nSoon I didn\u2019t want to leave for the islands.\n\n\
  As I headed to board the boat, self-pity proving too easy to surrender to, I dragged\
  \ my backpack along the wooden plaques of the pier.\n\nWait - I hadn\u2019t bought\
  \ a bracelet from my new friend.\n\nEmma was already there, carefully assessing\
  \ the bracelets in her hand and comparing each to my wrist. She tied a pink braided\
  \ band around my wrist, looked up at me, gave me a final hug and ran back down the\
  \ pier.\n\n\u201CI haven\u2019t paid you Emma!\u201D\n\n\u201CFor you, my friend\u201D\
  \n\nI'd met a child free of the usual exploitation of street selling, and though\
  \ I knew other children may not be as fortunate, for Emma it was not about what\
  \ she was selling, but what she had acquired: my friendship.\n\nSihanoukville had\
  \ proved itself to be more than a simple stop-off destination. It was a truly unique\
  \ place, a place that didn\u2019t disappear with Emma across the sand."
