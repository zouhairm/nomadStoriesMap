Text: "\u201CSo, where are you guys going for your honeymoon? France, Italy, Bali,\
  \ or\u2026?\u201D My friend Meera asks me while looking at the world map hanging\
  \ above my study table.\nAs I turn enthusiastically to respond, my mother signs,\
  \ \u201CWherever Ashwin will take my Pari to\u201D, and kisses my forehead.\nMeera\
  \ and I look at each other, and sigh at the vulnerability of being a girl. It\u2019\
  s not the first time that my opinion has not been asked. But, I don\u2019t know\
  \ why I couldn\u2019t sleep last night. \nI brush my hair and tie them on a ponytail\
  \ as I am running late to office. My mother hangs up the phone and says, \u201C\
  Take a short leave from office today. Your mother-in-law wants you to be at Wedding\
  \ Couture Store to finalize your wedding lehenga.\u201D \n\u201CAt least, one should\
  \ have asked me first if I am available\u201D, I replied annoyingly.\nSomehow, I\
  \ reach to the store. And, everyone is suggesting what looks good on me. But, no\
  \ one has asked, even once, what the bride wants! After 30 minutes, Ashwin enters\
  \ the store. \n\u201COh! Am glad you are here.\u201D \n\u201CWhat happened, why\
  \ are you looking sad?\u201D \n\u201CAshwin, I don\u2019t think this lehenga goes\
  \ with my personality. But, your mother has finalized it. Can\u2019t we go to another\
  \ shop?\u201D I requested.\n\u201CSo, that\u2019s your problem!\u201D He laughs.\
  \ \u201CMy mother has a great taste. If she has chosen something, you will look\
  \ beautiful in it. Trust me, she knows better.\u201D\n\u201CI think, everyone on\
  \ this earth knows everything better than me\u201D, I replied with anger.\nNext\
  \ day I have called up our families for a meeting. \n\u201CI want to break off our\
  \ engagement\u201D. Everyone is stunned. They are trying to figure out what went\
  \ wrong between Ashwin and me. \n\u201CNo. It\u2019s not about Ashwin. It\u2019\
  s about all of you. It\u2019s about me. It\u2019s about living my life on my own\
  \ terms.\u201D I answered their allegations. \n\u201CSo you are living it.\u201D\
  \ My father argues and gives me every reason that proves that I am not living in\
  \ a cage. \n\u201CBut, the thing is I am just living a life. I am not alive. I am\
  \ not pursuing a job of my choice. I wasn\u2019t asked if I want to marry him. I\
  \ was never asked what I want in my life. And am sure, I will never be asked. That\u2019\
  s not how life is meant to be lived.\u201D \n\u201CI\u2019m sorry Ashwin, I can\u2019\
  t make you happy if I\u2019m not\u201D, and I sign off.\nNext morning, my father\
  \ helps me pack my bag. As I come out to go on a trip to Bhutan, I see Ashwin standing\
  \ there to drive me to the airport. \nI ask him for car keys, and he offers his\
  \ help, \u201CI\u2019ll drop you.\u201D\nI thank him and tell him with a smile,\
  \ \u201CI\u2019m going on a road trip.\u201D\nThe real journey begins here."
