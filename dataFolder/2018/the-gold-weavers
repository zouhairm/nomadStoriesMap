Text: "Those were College days. Me and my friend had an undying passion for motorcycles\
  \ and mountains. So, one fine day, we revved up our motorcycles and were racing\
  \ towards heaven at one hundred kilometers per hour. We headed to the last village\
  \ in India on the Tibet Frontier. Its called Chitkul.\n\nLittle did we know that\
  \ the journey would be a mix of breathtaking landscapes of lush green hills and\
  \ nerve-racking landslides of rocky-mud mountains. Somehow we survived through the\
  \ many obstacles we faced. The motorcycles had minor problems but the burning fuel\
  \ in us kept us moving. \n\nWe have reached Chitkul late in the night, completely\
  \ exhausted and disappointed. Disappointed that we couldn't witness the sunset in\
  \ the evening. It started to snow and we froze ourselves to sleep that night. The\
  \ very next morning, we woke up with re-formed excitement and started to explore\
  \ the place.\n\nThe last thing I expected was to hear at least some interesting\
  \ stories from the local villagers. And then came a bag full of surprises for us.\
  \ We were invited into a home for some tea. The tea leaves freshly boiled in water\
  \ and with some honey added, I wondered why the gods have blessed these people with\
  \ so much of happiness. \n\nWhile sipping the tea and chatting with them, I looked\
  \ through a small 5*5 window. The sunlight reflected from the snow was pretty soft\
  \ and was of golden shade. I saw a woman. Her eyes depicted sadness. I wanted to\
  \ go there and ask about her problems. In the meantime, the people who were hosting\
  \ us told me that the woman's son has left her 18 years back and went to some city\
  \ for livelihood. She was waiting since eighteen long years for her son to return\
  \ back to her. She wanted to see him at least once and talk to him and feed him.\
  \ I was so moved by what I heard.\n\nI love speed. When the throttle is up and the\
  \ air passes through my ears with a whooshing speed, I just love it. After the story\
  \ I heard, a picture of my mother stuck in my head. What if I had met with an accident\
  \ here and never went back? What if she waits eighteen long years for me even though\
  \ she knows am never going to come back. The thought of what would she go through\
  \ made me crazy. \n\nWe packed our bags, revved out motorcycles, but this time,\
  \ responsibly. The last thing I expected was that a little story heard somewhere\
  \ would change my attitude forever."
