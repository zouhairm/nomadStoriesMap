Text: "Our home was called Banksia after the native plant that bloomed in the Australian\
  \ bush. \nIt was a burgundy 4WD car with a greenish super awesome roof top tent\
  \ that opened as a book on the side, where a leather allowed us to climb in. Inside,\
  \ the four textile walls had windows with nets and, in the first stage of desert\
  \ nights, a gentle wind pleased my skin exhausted from the Sun. \nWe were camping\
  \ at Kunjarra, Northern Territory, nearby huge red granite boulders, on a flat ancient\
  \ land covered with a sandy scarlet mantle, that silent spread everywhere to met\
  \ at the horizon the pure essence of blue.\n\nI was travelling with my adventures\
  \ and life partner Michele, an amazing human being with the ability to make the\
  \ World smile with him. \nMonths before we took a decision that was scary, yet awakening,\
  \ to please that nomadic instinct that was calling for natural wonders and freedom,\
  \ and take off for a life-changing  journey within Australian Wilderness: a road\
  \ trip of two years, 40000km through six countries and the most challenging and\
  \ fulfilling moments of my life.\nTravelling from the Tasmanian lands of Roaring\
  \ Forties winds, across the rough coasts of Victoria and the lands of the Murray\
  \ River; East along the Great Dividing Range and the Great Barrier Reef, till Daintree\
  \ oldest between the rainforests. And then the heart: the Central Outback.\nWe lived\
  \ camping in unique environments, dancing in untouched lands of powerful Nature.\
  \ Many were the challenges, and meanwhile we were proceeding in the journey I was\
  \ getting to know myself better, finding determination along the hikes, lessons\
  \ in wildlife and plants and bliss into simple life.\n\nDesert was the last chapter\
  \ of this journey, and it was a surreal landscape where the extreme heat created\
  \ mirages and the road melted into sky; there was no hiding from the burning Sun\
  \ that stared all day till silent, started to disappear into the horizon, colouring\
  \ dunes in auburn. \nIn living into the Wild its presence had a deep impact on me,\
  \ creating a connection made of respect and instincts. Here, my sight was endless,\
  \ and the place revealed itself with the power of a thunder, in a vision of pure\
  \ isolation and bare essence of life.\n\nWhen night came my feet were dipped into\
  \ the warm sand and my head was surrounded by billions of stars.\nI thought: \"\
  I can touch them\""
