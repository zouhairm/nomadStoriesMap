Text: "It\u2019s hot, so hot, I can feel the sweat trickling down my back. From the\
  \ chaos around me I know something special is happening but nothing can prepare\
  \ me for what I\u2019m about to see.\n\nCycling in 27 degree heat, up and down hills\
  \ and along dusty tracks in this undulating part of Laos, my burning legs and lungs\
  \ are just about keeping up with our whipper snapper tour guide and my younger boyfriend.\
  \ \u201CPlease can we go and explore the village? I feel like we\u2019ve cycled\
  \ past so many but not really seen anything.\u201D I\u2019m eager to experience\
  \ what real life is like for the Hmong tribes, I can\u2019t bear to see them wiz\
  \ by.  \n\nTrying to ignore my stiffness and the stinging sweat and sunscreen in\
  \ my eyes we make our way through the dusty pathways. Rudimentary houses made of\
  \ wood and bamboo surround us in this small village just outside of Luang Probang.\n\
  \nThe alleyways are baron of people but plenty of panting dogs, chickens and the\
  \ occasional pig. Meandering through, I look twice, yes, that is a dead cow\u2019\
  s head hanging over the doorstep of that house, it\u2019s dark grey tongue hanging\
  \ lifeless from its mouth jiggling as the cow vigorously moves back and forth without\
  \ any life within it. \n\nWe\u2019ve stumbled upon the cause for the baron streets.\
  \ \n\nCuriosity and wonder draw us towards a side door, we\u2019re ushered into\
  \ the house by a local man chewing on I don\u2019t know what. From the glaring sun\
  \ we suddenly find ourselves enveloped in darkness, sweat, hope and belief. About\
  \ 40 people are swirling and shouting around us with vigor and excitedness in this\
  \ cramped space. \n\nThe main attraction is a shaman leaping up and down so high\
  \ he could hit heaven. Eyes covered by a veil, facing his alter, chanting and waving\
  \ his tamborine, he\u2019s consumed in his trance. I\u2019m immersed in his energy\
  \ and captured by the curious scene. As a man of God, healing is his intent by rebalancing\
  \ the spirits of a sick couple. The cow is an offering.  \n\nI scan the room. Through\
  \ the dust I can see faith and confidence, a knowing of something greater. The shaman\
  \ stops, takes off his now wet veil. Our gazes meet. I came here to see what life\
  \ was like for these tribes, I didn\u2019t expect such a life lesson. I\u2019d been\
  \ grappling with the idea of a higher entity. It\u2019s obvious to me now that every\
  \ culture, in different forms, manifests their beliefs. I\u2019m not the only one,\
  \ I won\u2019t be the first or the last. I stand amongst strangers but I feel like\
  \ I belong, their faith seeping into me. I smile inwardly, I needn't have questioned\
  \ it all along."
