Text: "They say that before you get there, after 2 days of intense walking in the\
  \ Jungle, you have to go up 1200 steps made of stones. I was too exhausted to count,\
  \ and too exited to care. \n\nAs a little boy I was captivated by stories of pre-colombian\
  \ temples lost in the sea of trees. When I moved to Bogota, I read online that there\
  \ was a Lost City, well preserved in the Sierra Nevada, on the Caribbean coast.\
  \ I couldn't get it out of my mind. \n\nMost people describe it as a very long and\
  \ difficult trek. It requires a good physical condition, a strong sense of self\
  \ control. It will take you 2 or 3 full days to get there, and the same to get back.\n\
  \nIt's 2014, I am 25 and to be quite honest, I could have benefit from a little\
  \ bit of exercise, I was not physically prepared. I have been warned, but temptation\
  \ was too strong. I decided not to let the fear take over, and just go for it. What\
  \ did I have to lose, appart from a few kilos? \n\nHere I am, end of July in Santa\
  \ Marta, beautiful colonial town founded in 1525. On the first day of the trek,\
  \ I understand at around noon, that people were right. It was going to be my most\
  \ challenging experience ever. So yes, going to the Lost City is hard, it is painful,\
  \ and it seems, at times impossible, but what I gained from it is priceless. \n\n\
  On the way, we have met the Kogi people. They descend from the Tayrona, the people\
  \ who built the Lost City, and live everywhere in the Sierra Nevada. Dressed in\
  \ a simple white dress, girls wear necklaces and the boys wear the famous Mochila\
  \ (knitted wool bag).\n\nBack to my misery, after hours of going up in the dust,\
  \ carrying my bag and water. This is on the second day in the morning, that, pushed\
  \ to the edge, I feel like my legs are saying stop. This is when I think to myself\
  \ \"the Kogi people walk the same path everyday, barefoot, with no comfort other\
  \ than their love for the surrounding nature\". I couldn't be weak.\n\nDetermined\
  \ and exited, I would get to that city. There are moments when I regret, when I\
  \ doubt, but there are other, when I feel proud.\nOn the following day, I understand\
  \ what 1200 stone steps meant. It is the last trial before I get to feel like Indiana\
  \ Jones.\n\nOnce up there, you enter this sacred site, that was left more than a\
  \ thousand years ago only to be found around 40 years ago. Being there teaches you\
  \ many things, it shows the respect people have for their land, for their story.\
  \ What was taken from them, and the need to preserve their heritage."
