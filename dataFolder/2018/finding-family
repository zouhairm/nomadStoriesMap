Text: "My grandpa was sick. He had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and visiting\
  \ Japan was the top item on his \u201Cbucket list.\u201D In 2016, the week after\
  \ he finished a new type of targeted radiation therapy at Stanford University, my\
  \ aunt, mom and I boarded a 12-hour international flight with my determined grandfather,\
  \ headed for Tokyo.\n[To fully understand the importance of this trip, you also\
  \ need a bit of family history. My grandfather, Roy, was Japanese American. The\
  \ son of immigrants, he was born and raised in San Francisco. His parents owned\
  \ and operated a successful dry cleaning business until the outbreak of WWII in\
  \ 1941. From the bay area, his family was relocated to Heart Mountain, Wyoming for\
  \ the duration of WWII. After the war, his family was unable to return to the west\
  \ coast and relocated to Salt Lake City. Roy joined the Army and was stationed in\
  \ post-WWII Tokyo as an interpreter. His unit oversaw the return of Japanese POW\
  \ from Siberian prison camps. His first visit to Tokyo was in 1949, where he witnessed,\
  \ first hand, the destruction caused by firebombing in WWII. His last visit to Tokyo\
  \ was in 2016.]\nTaking my grandpa back to Japan was secondary to my own desire\
  \ to acquire a new passport stamp and experience the country. I had my own personal\
  \ \u201Cbucket list\u201D of things I wanted to see while we were there, but nothing\
  \ I saw compared to everything I saw through his eyes.\nAs we explored and I experience\
  \ Japan for the first time, all I could think about was how different this must\
  \ be from his last experience.\nAt the Edo Tokyo museum, the most poignant stop\
  \ was the WWII exhibit; my grandfather paused at the bird's eye photos of Tokyo\
  \ during Allied occupation. You can clearly see the city streets, but where buildings\
  \ should stand, there was only rubble. Everything had been leveled flat by bombings.\
  \ After a moment, he touched one of the only still-standing buildings and announced,\
  \ \u201CI stayed in a building not far from here. This is where the General Headquarters\
  \ were.\u201D This brief encounter illustrated the stark difference between a fallen\
  \ Tokyo and the bustling modern city that we experienced after leaving the museum.\
  \ During our visit to Tokyo\u2019s Shinjuku neighborhood, as my eyes adjusted to\
  \ the neon lights on every building, all I could imagine was what this exact view\
  \ would have looked like in 1949.\nWe took a shortcut through a pachinko parlor.\
  \ Overwhelming for me, but my grandfather remarked that it had the same musical\
  \ clatter of pachinko machines and smoky haze that he remembered."
