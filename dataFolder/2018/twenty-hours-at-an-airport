Text: "I looked out the large window into the Dutch sky through the runway lined with\
  \ tails of airplanes parked one behind the other. It was 9 in the night but the\
  \ sky was as lit as midday in Delhi. Stuck at the Amsterdam airport between two\
  \ flights, for 20 hours, I was amazed, confused, hungry and sleepless. I was also\
  \ broke. Flying from Lima where I had been on a two-month student cultural exchange\
  \ trip, I was left penniless by the extremely unusual \u201Cdeparture tax\u201D\
  . Now, in this mammoth of an airport nothing that could be called a meal could be\
  \ bought for the 5 dollar bill and few coins I had retrieved from the clutter in\
  \ my wallet. I must have walked around the airport several times, looking through\
  \ the same coffee stands and food plazas again and again. It also helped kill time.\
  \ I tried asking the tall Dutch people at the helpdesk where could I find something\
  \ cheap to eat, but they failed to grasp the extent of my pauperdom. I was too intimidated\
  \ by their height, their accents, and their whiteness to coax them any further.\
  \ That\u2019s when I saw a black man in a suit with an ID hung around his neck,\
  \ looking around for something himself. While the ID gave him authenticity, he showed\
  \ a certain vulnerability that made him approachable. Or maybe it was the color\
  \ of his skin that seemed a shade of mine. Anyway, I greeted him and told him what\
  \ I was looking for. He directed me to the same food plaza that I had already scoured.\
  \ Sheepishly, I turned around to walk away. He understood my predicament and called\
  \ out to me.\n\u201CYou really don\u2019t have any money, do you?\u201D\n\u201C\
  Five dollars.\u201D I shrugged and said.\nHe smiled and laid down a proposition\
  \ that I liked. This gentleman was an official at the Nigerian Embassy in Amsterdam\
  \ and was trying to locate a stranded flier from his home country on that labyrinthine\
  \ airport. The offer was that he would buy me a meal and in return, I had to help\
  \ him find this man.\nThe next minute we were sitting at a table at the food plaza\
  \ with a big plate of spaghetti with a ladleful of Nepolitana sauce and some fresh\
  \ bread. We spent the next hour having the heartiest meal and the most engaging\
  \ conversation I would have ever had in my life. This was followed by two hours\
  \ of playing I spy with every black man, sleeping or awake, at the airport and asking\
  \ him his name until we found the right man.\nTired after a night of adventure,\
  \ I had to bid him adieu. \u201CI wish I could do something for you.\u201D\n\u201C\
  Help a traveler in need. That\u2019s all!\u201D, he smiled and said."
