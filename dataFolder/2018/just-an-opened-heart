Text: "I was exploring the city on foot, enjoying my own time in the quietness of\
  \ Banda Neira, a small town located on the central island of the Bandas group in\
  \ Mollucas province, when the voice of a group of  students drew my attention. They\
  \ walked two-by-two form the long line. Immediately I followed them and rushed to\
  \ the front line. Eager to know where they were going to, I made conversation with\
  \ one of the teachers \u2013 her name is Lastri - and only within minute, she invited\
  \ me to join their weekly picnic to a nearby beach, located around 15 minutes with\
  \ a small boat to the other part of the island. \n\nWe landed on the beach and while\
  \ waiting for others to cross the sea, she took me around. Answering my questions\
  \ about the island and the way the locals live. Explaining to me things that we\
  \ saw. She did not try to conceal her proud feeling of her home island. She was\
  \ so passionate and it was shown in her voice and body language. Cheerful, friendly,\
  \ fearless, humble, and determined. Her spirit was so alive and it drew us closer\
  \ as we then shared some parts of our lives to each other. Living in a small town\
  \ which many of us can not locate on the world map did not contain her ambition\
  \ that someday she want to visit Jakarta and some other countries. I encouraged\
  \ her by saying that nothing is impossible and for her to dare to dream. Her tears\
  \ fell when I said that.\n\nThe great weather, the sound of the waves crashing the\
  \ on the beach, the voice of the winds blowing in the trees, the color of the sea\
  \ and sky, the view of Mt Banda, were our background as we strolled around and sharing\
  \ to each other.\n\nOur walk lasted only less than 30 minutes but when we had to\
  \ say goodbye to each other, the bond was real. She hugged me close and cried. We\
  \ made promise to each other that we would keep in touch. My tears fell down when\
  \ I was waving to her.\n\nAs I was sitting on the boat that would drop me off on\
  \ the other part of the island, my mind lingered thinking about my time spent with\
  \ Lastri just couple minutes before. I stunned, amazed that it is possible to have\
  \ such a bond with someone that you have not met before within a very short time.\
  \ A stranger to a sister only needs an open heart.\n\nThe boat dropped me and I\
  \ continued my exploration. The weather was great. The almost empty roads, the smell,\
  \ the wind, the trees, the mountain, the buildings, the colors, the voices, the\
  \ people. \"Just an opened heart,\" I whispered.\n\nHer name is Lastri, a cheerful\
  \ teacher from Banda Neira."
