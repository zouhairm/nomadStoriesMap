Text: "It happened so quickly that I didn\u2019t even feel it. The rock skipped across\
  \ the pale sand, ricocheted off of an abandoned conch shell, and cut into my lower\
  \ shin. I was staying in the Colonial Zone and had grown tired of the clamoring\
  \ noise of the inner city. I longed for the little cove with its arching palm trees,\
  \ fresh caf\xE9 con leche, and the stewed rock lobster and grits breakfast. Boca\
  \ Chica. I needed to disinfect the minor cut and apply a bandage before sand flies\
  \ and mosquitos turned a minor inconvenience into a visit to a doctor\u2019s office.\
  \ As I bent over, another stone whizzed by my ear, barely missing my left eye. A\
  \ soccer team stood in a casual circle performing morning stretches. I tried to\
  \ process the events as they unfolded. Before I knew what was happening I was marching\
  \ directly towards the assembled young men. They were grunting and shouting as I\
  \ approached, as if they were apes. I blurted out, \u201CWho\u2019s in charge here?\
  \ Who threw those rocks!\u201D Suddenly the group grew quiet, their faces drained\
  \ of blood. When they realized I was American their demeanors changed.  A security\
  \ officer, who\u2019d witnessed my interaction approached us. In clipped, but crisp\
  \ English he asked, \u201CAre we OK here, cadets?\u201D Cadets. They were a police\
  \ academy squad in training. \u201CIs there a problem, senor?\u201D Is there a problem.\
  \ I knew that these guys needed this job and that an infraction such as, say, assault\
  \ would mean expulsion. They were probably supporting entire households. I looked\
  \ them all up and down, head to toe, and told the officer that there was no problem.\
  \ Because of my dark skin and Caribbean features, I looked Haitian. I considered\
  \ all of this and moved on. Later that day, as I sat at an outdoor caf\xE9 in the\
  \ beach's village, three cadets pulled up on two mopeds. The most muscular of them,\
  \ Fernando, spoke. \u201CWe are sorry. We appreciate you not reporting.\u201D I\
  \ nodded and then explained that I was headed to a nearby restaurant for dinner.\
  \ \u201CThat place, nah! Basura! You\u2019re come with us.\u201D In that moment,\
  \ I could have declined, but instead I paid my tab, told the barista Jesusita, who\
  \ I\u2019d befriended days earlier, where I was going and hopped on the back of\
  \ Fernando\u2019s moped. He drove me to the best smothered grouper I\u2019ve ever\
  \ eaten. We friended each other on Facebook and remain connected. He has since become\
  \ an officer. In some small way I am encouraged by this experience. On the day that\
  \ we became friends we both learned a very valuable lesson: We all bleed the same\
  \ blood."
