Text: "BHANGARH FORT.\nAround 70 km from the Jaipur City, Situated on the border of\
  \ Sariska Tiger Reserve in the Aravali range, Bhangarh Fort was built by Madho Singh\
  \ in 1613.This 17th century fort in the Alwar District of Rajasthan is often associated\
  \ with horror stories. Ghost and spirits are rumoured to roam in Bhangarh Fort and\
  \ there are a lot of weird stories that have been shared by the visitors and locals\
  \ of the area.\n19th January, 2018. After around 6 months me and my friends have\
  \ had a get together in Jaipur at my friend's (aaditya) place. We were discussing\
  \ about each other's life and then we started talking about how we gonna spend our\
  \ time in Jaipur. We had decided to do party in the night at his place. Friend's,\
  \ drinks, snack's and music system, we had everything which we wanted to. Its gonna\
  \ be fun we shouted \U0001F605. Party started and after 4-5 round of drink it was\
  \ around 12 in the night, and suddenly my friend said guys lets go somewhere out,\
  \ okay we said. We walked out the house, started bike and leave. It was not planned\
  \ that where we are going. Then my friend said let's go to BHANGARH FORT. For a\
  \ moment me and Akshay started thinking that what he is saying, we thought he was\
  \ drunk. But later decided to go. It was 1:30am when we reached at Bhangarh Fort.\
  \ The main door was closed and we knew that so we had decided to enter from the\
  \ back side of the Fort. There was a tunnel through which we had entered in the\
  \ palace. It was completely dark that we hardly able to see anythin. We turned on\
  \ our phones flash light and continued. We walked and came right in front of the\
  \ entrance door of palace. It was very cold in the night, temo was around 5\xB0\
  c. Cold wind was breezing. The wind was feeling so glorious but at the same time\
  \ the sound that wind was making sacred us too. Yes we were scared too but was way\
  \ too excited to do this. We decided to stay there and do some bonfire. We collected\
  \ sticks around us and burned them. We started talking, playing games, listening\
  \ music and witnessing the most thrilling and Haunted experience of our life.\n\
  Don't know whether there were any spirit or not in the palace as we have not encountered\
  \ with any one. But definitely it was Haunted. Extremely Haunted. We still think\
  \ that how we managed to spend the whole night inside the palace. It is said that\
  \ you have to sacrifice something to gain something, so i guess it was our fear\
  \ that we sacrificed to feel, experience that Haunted memories. It was out of the\
  \ world. There is lot of things which left unsaid."
