Text: "I arrived at the address, surprised to find a shopfront. The sun had started\
  \ to set and pink light illuminated the dust on the street, it felt apocalyptic.\
  \ I entered, it was already dark inside. For a moment I thought I\u2019d got the\
  \ wrong place but, from the front counter, I could see through a passage way to\
  \ the guts of a house, maybe a living room, and someone seated on a couch, the TV\
  \ was blaring. Blanca turned and spotted me, she ushered me in.\n\nI dumped my bag\
  \ in the hallway and greeted her awkwardly. To the left of us, a small, windowless\
  \ toilet which, I later discovered, shared a hole in the wall with the guest bedroom.\
  \ To the right, an apparently forgotten alcove, used as a dumping ground for stacks\
  \ of open boxes filled with papaya. The fruit has been left to rot, it was laced\
  \ with fruit flies and gave off a smell somewhere between gruyere and sweat. Next\
  \ to the alcove, a patio, where, half hidden behind lines of laundry, a giant pit\
  \ bull scraped up against a large cage, rumbling and pacing.\n\nA little taken aback,\
  \ I announced in clumsy Spanish that I was tired and excused myself, a little rudely,\
  \ from spending the evening with Blanca on the couch. She seemed taken aback but\
  \ I escaped to my room anyway. Hours later, I was still awake, denied sleep by blood-seeking\
  \ mozzies, the scent of rotting papaya, and the early morning sounds and smells\
  \ of a ceremonious visit to the loo next door - the one sharing air with my room.\
  \ \n\nIn the morning, Blanca dragged me from the depths of a last-minute snooze\
  \ with a loud knock. She led me upstairs to the kitchen, through the window I could\
  \ see the sun rising above the town\u2019s rooftops and the hills beyond. A fruit\
  \ basket and vase of wild flowers sat on the counter, a pot boiled, and black coffee\
  \ was poured, it was the heart of the house. Bathed in morning light, I felt like\
  \ I was seeing Blanca for the first time, she was as I\u2019d imagined from our\
  \ short exchange on the phone - large, colourful, all smiles and warm bosom. With\
  \ coral lips and packet-dyed blonde hair, she was unrestrained and commanded my\
  \ attention. I ate corn tortillas, fried eggs, local cheese, and pickled baby chillies.\
  \ With my belly filled and the morning sun burning off my memory of last night,\
  \ I felt I\u2019d emerged from the shadows of a bad dream. I reminded myself of\
  \ Blanca\u2019s kindness in offering me what she had so I could have a safe place\
  \ to sleep for the night, and to acknowledge generosity in whatever form it came."
