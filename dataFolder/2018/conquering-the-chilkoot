Text: "Perhaps it was when the rusted remains of a 118-year-old sled began to look\
  \ tasty. Or, maybe it was when my knee cracked so loudly during heavy rainfall that\
  \ my hiking companion turned around, and tried to spot the miraculously dry branch\
  \ I must have stepped on to produce such a sound underfoot. Whichever moment it\
  \ was, I was made very aware that my trek along the Chilkoot Trail was a test of\
  \ my health. \nI, of course, felt that I was fit enough for the journey. I had been\
  \ managing my iron deficiency for months, and had spent good money on a knee brace,\
  \ knowing that the climb would test a joint that had been challenging me since my\
  \ early teens. I had also been meticulously researching how to pack strategically,\
  \ ensuring that I had all of the essentials while not exceeding 40lbs. of weight\
  \ in my bag. I had done practice hikes up some of the most challenging peaks in\
  \ my home town. I had tested the camping food. There was nothing that I felt would\
  \ hold me back by the time my companion and I arrived at the trailhead in Alaska.\n\
  We started strong. The first two days, we laughed in spite of cold rains and mud-covered\
  \ packs. We kept a strong pace, and dawdled for a time; snacking on Clif Bars and\
  \ snapping photos of glaciers and artifacts. We revelled in the wonder around us,\
  \ often commenting on how unbelievable it was that 100,000 people trekked the same\
  \ path on the quest for gold. 100,000 people with crates of food and belongings\
  \ that required multiple camps and rest stops, and multiple trips up and down the\
  \ pass, itself. And we were marching with padded bags, proper footwear, and a weather-resistant\
  \ tent.\nWhen we reached the Golden Staircase, the laughter quieted. The pauses\
  \ were not for photos, but for footing. For me, each pause was a moment of taming\
  \ a growing fear that the mountain would win. My knee throbbed, and my energy was\
  \ dipping steadily. The rocks I clung to reminded me that I was nothing but another\
  \ set of feet upon them. If I fell, nature wouldn't forgive me. I was fatigued by\
  \ the time we reached the top. \nBut we reached the top. \nFor two more days, we\
  \ kept going: Through pain and fatigue, and a body that was pushed beyond anything\
  \ it had ever done before. The last few miles were the final reminder that nature\
  \ was in control, and we trudged through sand. Each step came with trembling legs,\
  \ and muttered profanity. \nThen there was silence, save for the sound of a door\
  \ opening at the Bennett Lake train station. We made it. I made it."
