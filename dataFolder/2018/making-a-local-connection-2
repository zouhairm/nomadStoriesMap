Text: "Traveling isn't just about a break from the mundane routine of life, but it\u2019\
  s about exploring the world and making it your own. And, this can only happen when\
  \ one envisions the world with a \u2018Glocal' lens and turns local to the city\
  \ that one visits. \n\nWhich is why, when ever a traveller chooses a city, they\
  \ do have a \u2018Check-list\u2019 that would helps them to acclimatise and enjoy\
  \ the trip from the moment one de-boards the mode of traveling and steps into the\
  \ city of their visit. Hence, it won\u2019t be wrong to say that \u2013\n\n\u2018\
  A Traveller\u2019s Checklist Is Indeed A Gateway To Making A Local Connection With\
  \ The City Of Their Choice.\u2019\n\nAnd, upon visiting the city it\u2019s the itinerary\
  \ that first sprinkles the local flavours of that place in the traveller\u2019s\
  \ life but it\u2019s that explorer in the traveller that syncs her/him with the\
  \ city. Which is why we often see the travellers capturing the places & often tagging\
  \ themselves with every thing that speaks about the places viz.- the local cuisines,\
  \ to the local markets, to the local attires, to the local beliefs, to the local\
  \ to-do activities. \n\nAnd, when the itinerary comes to an end, it\u2019s these\
  \ memories that the traveller takes backs with themselves and upon reaching back\
  \ to their home, the traveller then takes the role of the narrator or I should say\
  \ -the local travel guide, who then shares their experiences of the trip with their\
  \ social network.\n\nHence, travelling does help one create a local connection with\
  \ the visits to different cities/countries."
