Text: "I read in a magazine once that there are two major jungles to hack through\
  \ when traveling in a foreign country: the language jungle and the logic jungle.\
  \ The logic jungle was thick for me in Italy, but I found a brief clearing in the\
  \ house I stayed in on Via Buonarrotti in Rome.\n\nGian Carlo Castrelli sat at the\
  \ blue sparkly art deco table in the corner of the kitchen. I couldn\u2019t walk\
  \ into that kitchen without catching a slight movement from the corner of my eye\
  \ of the chain-smoking, shadowy form on the far side. It had been a cold winter,\
  \ inside my soul and out. I was broke and I\u2019d already spent eight months wandering.\
  \ I didn\u2019t need such an historical city in my life anymore. I was lonely, there\
  \ was an empty chair at the kitchen table, and I sat in it.\n\nGian Carlo had bright\
  \ eyes, olive skin, and lean muscles. But he also had an ancient face, grey dirty\
  \ hair, and he moved like a sloth. One day, I was sitting and watching him eat,\
  \ staring at him in complete awe. \u201CDios mio! You move your fork slower than\
  \ anyone I\u2019ve ever met\u201D, I said. He just made a shoulder shrugging \u201C\
  So\u201D. On this particular day, he moved his fork so slowly and shakily, the food\
  \ fell off and I got to witness the fork reach his mouth empty and his quick sudden\
  \ glance down at his plate, one eyebrow raised questioningly. I was in hysterics.\n\
  \nBut there was nothing I did that didn\u2019t go without commentary either. He\
  \ especially had a problem with the way I walked. \u201CLike a Roman soldier\u201D\
  , he said. \u201CA woman should walk slower, more gracefully, let her hips sway\
  \ a little from side to side.\u201D \u201CA woman\u2019s rear end is like poetry.\u201D\
  \ Once he asked me to practice walking for him around the kitchen. I told him to\
  \ go to hell and lit one of his cigarettes for myself and poured us another grappa.\
  \ \n\nOne of his points seemed to be that opportunity always happens now. Now. But\
  \ I didn\u2019t care to hear too much of this \u201Cseize the moment\u201D stuff.\
  \ One thing I knew was that Italian men were geniuses at helping women seize the\
  \ moment. I wasn\u2019t going to fall for that one. But sitting in that smoky kitchen\
  \ with him, drinking grappa, opera music playing faintly from one of the dark corners\
  \ of the house, listening to him describe the women of his past, eyes closed, hand\
  \ quivering slightly next to the ash tray, just seemed really Italian to me. More\
  \ Italian than the vendors and gypsies playing accordions on the street or the restaurant\
  \ kitchens packed with illegal immigrants. More Italian than the museums or my file\
  \ of photos."
