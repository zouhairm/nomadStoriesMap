Text: "This essay. \nThis moment. I\u2019m here 15\u2019 minutes before start to work\
  \ and this title brake me up, totally.\nI can\u2019t think this possible. I\u2019\
  m telling you 3 things that running in my head and no one until 1 year will\nKnow.\
  \ I want to quit my job. I\u2019m no longer happy since 2 years.  I have to admit\
  \ I must handle better my diabetes and I want to travel 3 months around\nthe globe,\
  \ visit all the continents before my 40\u2019s.The only things that make me happy\
  \ are travel , love and yes, my boy-friend. He\u2019s so kind that he knows that\
  \ every year I put on a bank account moneyfor the next trip instead for the wedding\
  \ or the house. I\u2019m so confused, I\u2019m 33 and the only thing I can say I\
  \ own is my Mac. No house, no kids, no car. Idon\u2019t know which is my life job.\
  \ But when I was at the deep point in my life ( my family kicked me out , alone\
  \ after a fight  around my ex boy-friend, they still don\u2019t know about the violence\
  \ on me) something inside me start to roar , like an animal.Like an old voice that\
  \ I keep too silent in me and I don\u2019t want to listen.Like a tiger. This is\
  \ my chance. My  time. My chance to look in the mirror at me and tell me :\u201D\
  Lara you\u2019ve saved you and you must take your life and do what you know you\u2019\
  re born to do\u201DWriting and travel.This is the only way to take my 18th hand\
  \ ,at my high school graduation day , look to my teacher when she Saied:\u201D you\u2019\
  ll never be a writer \u201C.Look at her and say : Fuck off.I\u2019m a kick-ass.\
  \ I became strong . I really don\u2019t know what to do but I know who am I.And\
  \ for all this , the last thing I expected is to be happy.In my mind, happiness\
  \ can\u2019t belong to me. I lied, I \u2018ve been ugly, I pursuit my goal without\
  \ thinking to the world around me. I \u2018ll never reach paradise ( if it\u2019\
  s existed) . I\u2019m not talking about one day happiness.Long life term happiness.Namibia,\
  \ last summer, in a camp holiday. waking up every day at 4 am, set down the tent\
  \ and camp and go away, a long free street full of stones .No people, just 10 of\
  \ us. No animals, no voices.One morning during a desert storm, sand in every single\
  \ part of my body , the untouched by sun too, I was tired, angry and disappointed\
  \ by my travel crew-The sun started to came up. I was the kind of person who sleep\
  \ during the documentary on wild life.So it was so un expected . That view , stone\
  \ desert and  mountain , silence and I\u2019ve starting to cry.I was happy to see\
  \ nothing.A nothing that make me full of happiness.Still now."
