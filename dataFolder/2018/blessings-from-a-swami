Text: "Our car navigated the lawless road; an intrepid soldier, northbound, marching\
  \ to the sounds of car horns which, although ceaseless, I barely place when I think\
  \ back to my travels in India. \n\nRishikesh was close. The holy Baba's home. \n\
  \nSwami Yogananda lived in the foothills of the Himalayas, teaching yoga  and living\
  \ his truth for over 80 years. \n\nA spiritual master had invited my friend and\
  \ I to visit him! However, my excitement waned when I found out we hadn't planned\
  \ a date or time to visit, it was getting late and he was 104 years old!\n\nIt was\
  \ dusk at the banks of the sacred Ganges when we arrived; along the skyline, light\
  \ grey outlining dark grey mountains.\n\nEager to meet the Swami, we boarded a small\
  \ red and yellow wooden-planked boat, with a blue tin roof , a hat on four stilts\
  \ framing us in. It's metal casing the only fragile divide between us and the mammoth\
  \ below.\n\nA luminous glow was growing from the fast approaching bank. The waters\
  \ strewn with hundreds of floating leaf-boats, offerings filled with flowers  and\
  \ each with a single flame, navigating prayers downstream. \n\nThe Ganga Aarti had\
  \ begun. \n\nThe Hindu ceremony rung with voices singing, offering thanks, creating\
  \ a general sense of well being. It built the perfect mood for our meeting with\
  \ the Swami.\n\nWe made quick offerings but couldn't delay, just to ensure he would\
  \ still be awake. He wasn't. \n\nWe found Swami Yogananda's room and our driver\
  \ knocked on his door determinedly. No answer. He knocked again undeterred, after\
  \ all, he had  brought people from Australia to say hello. Stirrings.\n\nPerhaps\
  \ it was that we had roused an old master from his sleep that made me uneasy, but\
  \ I wanted to walk away. I'm eternally grateful I didn't, as we would come to find\
  \ out just 15 months later that Swami Yogananda passed away.\n\nHe suddenly opened\
  \ his door, leaning against the frame on his left arm, posing for a photo. He was\
  \ ethereal. His saffron pants and long sleeve top hung off his barely-there frame,\
  \ but there was no mistaking the fortitude in his stance.\n\nHis eyes were lively\
  \ and his face, regal. He sported a long white beard anchored firmly in a grey base.\
  \ He offered us a CD with his teachings. \n\nThen, he blessed us.\n\nThe Swami asked\
  \ us to sit in front of him while he remained standing behind us. I sat at his right\
  \ hand and my friend at his left. We closed our eyes as he rested his hands on our\
  \ heads. In that moment, I felt tranquility and joy. \n\nI knew we were meant to\
  \ be there and nowhere else."
