Text: "This story is realted to my one decision which i was not decised but taken\
  \ by fault but whenever i thought about this exprince i got thriller smile.The stroy\
  \ is about who you get lost in moutain(near by uttarakhand) and found a couple with\
  \ his only child struggling for survival.In 2013 i decided to travel to uttrakhand\
  \ because travelling is something which is realtable to my soul  my soladitute.i\
  \ was on my way to kedarnath temple it was 16 kms long route i decided to take walk\
  \ to reach my ultimate spot.i just cover the distance by walking in just 3hrs while\
  \ travellng i got the news that someone of my friend is missing so i got panic n\
  \ chaos i decisided to go back down n bring her up.After walking a distnce of 9\
  \ kms again i was dreched by sweat my legs were paining its was 7:30pm no one is\
  \ there not even local it was dark.i heard a sound to a baby who is cryng because\
  \ of hunger and a couple to struggle to find the way to temple so i decided to help\
  \ them to reached our distination i just held hand of one the spouse and start walking\
  \ they werr shock by my gesture i assured them that i was there to help.its took\
  \ me another 4 hours to reach my venue but by this whole incident i got courage\
  \ to help n explore every part of me. Travellng is the way to connect yourself \n\
  By word may be i m unable to connect you but by travelling you can connect better\
  \ to yourself. I want to travel each part of this beautiful world which is not possible\
  \ in this single birth hahah.thank you"
