Text: "\u201CIt's alright, I'm just talking to my friend across the street,\u201D\
  \ the lady told me in a broken voice, her wild mouthing continuing as the bangles\
  \ running up her waving fore-arm created a jangling symphony.\n\nI was sat at a\
  \ bus stop in the empty town of Rainbow Beach, Australia, waiting for my ride north.\
  \ The sun had just finished its climb above the horizon, the spilt palette of colour\
  \ dissipating into a clear sky. The woman had been sat at the bus stop when I arrived,\
  \ and I had nodded her a greeting when her eyes flicked at me. \nHer face was filled\
  \ with striking features; sunken eyes, wrinkles of the sun, a nose which hooked\
  \ a unique path down and out.\n\nShe was whispering a flow of indistinguishable\
  \ words as her eyes flicked in sporadic patterns, and she had clearly seen my anxiously\
  \ thrown glances. I looked across the empty road, to the empty pavement.\nThere\
  \ was no-one there.\nI checked the time. My bus was due to come within the moment.\n\
  \n\u201CHe's just trying to find somewhere to park.\u201D She spoke again, her sight\
  \ fully fixed on me but her beady black eyes still darting in their dance. \u201C\
  He drove me here for a job interview I've got in a couple of minutes.\u201D Her\
  \ needless explanation was holding me in an unwilling fascination.\n\u201CI've got\
  \ an interview for a kitchen \u2013 Chef Judy they'll call me.\u201D I nodded politely\
  \ and she flashed a smile of wonky, yellowed teeth. \n\u201CThere's no room to park\
  \ here sweetie. Go find somewhere else.\u201D This time she didn't worry about whispering,\
  \ shouting across to nothing, and waving down the road, her bangles once more echoing\
  \ into the empty morning.\n\nShe stopped waving, and her hands fell into a silent\
  \ clasp in the lap of her flowing, pink dress. Then she exploded with the giggles\
  \ of a girl.\n\u201CThere's loads of room for him to park,\u201D she told me, her\
  \ words breaking through the laughter, but he'd never catch on to that. 'Cos I'm\
  \ too smart for him.\u201D She leant in as if telling a deep kept secret, \u201C\
  I tricked him.\u201D Again she giggled.\n\u201CI'm just too smart for anyone to\
  \ realise things like that. I'm the smartest of them all. Smarty pants Julia they\
  \ call me. That's why I've got an interview to be a lawyer.\u201D\n\nI hesitantly\
  \ wished her good luck in her interview as the bus arrived, and the stranger flashed\
  \ another happy smile.\n\n\u201CI'm going to be a teacher,\u201D she told me as\
  \ the bus doors began to close behind me. \u201CTeacher Joanna they'll call me.\u201D\
  \n\nTravelling let me see a different world through different eyes \u2013 even if\
  \ that world wasn't there for me."
