Text: "Mama India held up to her stories. She heightened the full range of senses,\
  \ starting with the pungent smells, to the bold colors at every turn, to the orchestra\
  \ of sounds from Hindu prayers combined with the startling honks of rickshaws swerving\
  \ through the lawless streets.\n\n\"What? You're Indian & you've never been to India?\
  \ That's weird.\"  \n\nWe didn't grow up going to the motherland due in large part\
  \ I'd imagine to the difficult immigration journey that my family navigated from\
  \ India to England and then later, England to the United States. Why go back to\
  \ that third world country we worked so hard to get away from? \n\nMy father legally\
  \ changed his name to Simon & he rarely spoke of his heritage, let alone ever speak\
  \ in his mother-tongue. Moving to America a few short months after 9/11 only added\
  \ a deeper wedge of disassociation from our roots.\n\nIt's said that in order to\
  \ have a strong & stable structure, it all starts with a solid foundation. While\
  \ I grew up in an environment where our heritage was rarely celebrated & on the\
  \ contrary it was shamed, I'd always dreamed of connecting with Mama India & establishing\
  \ that connection to the roots of my lineage. \n\nThe first time I went to India\
  \ was by myself. I distinctly remember the grounding feeling when my feet first\
  \ touched Indian soil. A vibrating energy pulsed throughout my core making me feel\
  \ at home in this completely new and foreign land. Being born and raised in England\
  \ and then moving to the US, I had always been in environments where I was typically\
  \ one of the few minorities, if not the only, in any given room. \n\n\"You're not\
  \ married? You're traveling alone?\"\n\nI was an odd case for many local Indians\
  \ that I came to meet. My independence as a young single woman is unfortunately\
  \ still a rare sight to see in India. Of course some assumed judgements were made\
  \ against me but more times than not, protective care was shown to me by those of\
  \ my motherland. \n\nAishwarya had recently moved to Mumbai from Hyderabad & she\
  \ asked me many questions about my global travels & relocations. She asked with\
  \ bright eyes of awe & with a sense of sisterly support & love. I learned so much\
  \ about what being a young woman in India is like through her and in short, it's\
  \ far from easy. I am committed to do everything in my power to use my voice & influence\
  \ to help my Desi sisters achieve deeper freedoms.\n\nI found Mama India confronting\
  \ & challenging at times while conversely nourishing & healing at other times. Ah,\
  \ the dichotomy."
