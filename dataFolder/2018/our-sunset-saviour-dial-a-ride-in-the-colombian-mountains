Text: "\u201CDo me a favour, go get your mates\u201D mumbled our saviour to his young\
  \ assistant. Else a daunting, dark hike home lay ahead of we three gringos. \n\n\
  We were in Minca, Colombia. Specifically, we were several hours walk uphill of even\
  \ that quaint coffee-farming town. Our aim: the promise of a mountaintop bar, offering\
  \ drinks, a pool table and an uninterrupted view of the sunset across the Colombian\
  \ valley and Caribbean coast beyond.\n\nBefore setting off, we doused ourselves\
  \ in insect repellent and asked for a map of the area; the casual locals produced\
  \ a hand-drawn masterpiece. There was no strict scale, but a wiggly line with adjacent\
  \ doodles seemed sufficient at the time. With just one copy for all prospective\
  \ hikers, we set off, equipped with a photo of a drawing and a romantic idea of\
  \ what lay ahead.\n\nWalking the dusty road to our dream destination, the views\
  \ across dense, verdant jungle led the eye to where the mountains seemed to meet\
  \ the sea. Blissfully ensconced in sunshine and scenery, passers-by were few and\
  \ far between. Rare human interaction resulted in drastically different estimations\
  \ of how far we still had to walk. From \u2018casi diez minutos\u2019 [around ten\
  \ minutes] to \u2018m\xE1s o menos una hora\u2019 [more or less an hour], or just\
  \ a sharp intake of breath; I discovered that no proud Latino will confess to not\
  \ knowing directions when asked.\n\nTwo and a half hours into our hour-long jaunt,\
  \ we reached our zenith; but to our devastation, no one was there. \n\nLucky for\
  \ us, our thirst and our weary legs, Colombians overcome an infamously troubled\
  \ past with an unrivalled welcoming spirit and a desire to showcase their glorious\
  \ country to anyone willing to explore. As such, two energetic dogs crossed our\
  \ path and led us to sanctuary. \n\nAsking for help, we were ushered in without\
  \ question: past the small house that sat atop the majestic hill and onto a veranda,\
  \ as the sky lit orange across the imposing valley. Whilst washing down fresh pineapple\
  \ with water distilled from the falls we had splashed through, our host\u2019s young\
  \ friend arrived. Few words were exchanged before he was gone again. \n\nNot long\
  \ after, he was back, alongside a moto-convoy, ready to ferry us home. In the dark,\
  \ damp air, the formerly dusty track had transformed to a muddy slip\u2019n\u2019\
  slide! Clinging to my newest motorbike-driving friend, slaloming between deep holes\
  \ in the pitch black, the downhill journey home was exhilarating. Even descending\
  \ into a puddle deeper than our tyres couldn\u2019t tarnish my buzz!"
