Text: "In September 2017, I first traveled to a city far from mine. Besides being\
  \ my first trip alone, S\xE3o Paulo is a megalopolis compared to my hometown, Macap\xE1\
  . It was not something I planned at first; I went to audition in person to try a\
  \ singing job for a South Korean entertainment company. SM Entertainment, the number\
  \ one of big tree top companies in the area. In a way, I represented my Amap\xE1\
  \ State because I was the only pre-selected one. It was challenging from start to\
  \ finish, everyone around me helped me to make every effort to make the trip possible\
  \ because my financial resources are scarce in relation to my will to achieve my\
  \ goals.\nI came across a new world. A lot of diversity, different people and a\
  \ busy life. I needed to survive for a week in that stone jungle. In my hometown\
  \ there is still tranquility, there are few buildings erected. In S\xE3o Paulo,\
  \ you need to survive; you need to fight against yourself and against everything\
  \ and everyone around you. Besides, I should be ready to make a good hearing, after\
  \ all, there were more than twenty thousand candidates coming from all over Brazil.\
  \ I, the candidate number 18,490 should do more than survive; I should be the best\
  \ of them.\nTo audition was a unique job opportunity. In addition, unfortunately\
  \ they did not select me. However, I have met so many people, who, in the midst\
  \ of so much mistrust, allow me to trust. I traveled alone, I was scared at first,\
  \ but until the end, I felt welcomed. The huge city, however unjust it is to some\
  \ social classes, accepts everyone who lands there. I had little money but the situation\
  \ of needing to be agile and rational to survive made I wake up to remember that\
  \ to be alive is to be awake to the details, to learn and to challenge oneself all\
  \ the time.\nI will not forget the fear I felt when I let go of my mother's hands\
  \ in the embarkation of the airport of Macap\xE1 and how I felt a frightened kitten\
  \ when I got lost in the largest airport in S\xE3o Paulo, Guarulhos. Moreover, how\
  \ the Uber driver gave me assistance so I got well to the apartment that I reserved\
  \ a room from Airbnb; how much the host helped me, knowing how little money I had.\n\
  The big city is very gray, but we can find generosity in it. We learn to survive,\
  \ but also to live and help to live. I sold almost everything I had, I let go of\
  \ the material things I liked, because I knew that life is sacrifices, but when\
  \ it is for something big, sacrifices are valuable exchange currencies the level\
  \ of what I want to achieve."
