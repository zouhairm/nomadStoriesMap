Text: "The photo in front of me shows three boys in their twenties leaning against\
  \ the wall of a dilapidated, brick house on a dusty road. The hairstyle of the oldest\
  \ of the three - a big afro, neatly combed out and perfectly shaped around a handsome\
  \ face \u2013 symbolizes black identity and black power. \n\nMy mind gently drifts\
  \ off to a small, local radio station, located in a neglected, green and lively\
  \ neighborhood in the outskirts of Salvador da Bahia in Brazil. This grassroots\
  \ radio station in the outskirts of Salvador had been set up to create a growing\
  \ political awareness among the community. I had chosen this remote neighborhood\
  \  as  social setting for my adventures. \n\n \u201CI take a seat in front of the\
  \ bus. The wobbly, long drive through dense humidity and overwhelming heat creates\
  \ a perfect moment for contemplation. The sequences of negative remarks and worried\
  \ facial expressions as a reaction to my visit to Bairro da Paz are still echoing\
  \ through my mind. A young, European, fair-skinned girl taking a bus on her own\
  \ to the biggest favela in town is difficult to understand for people that grow\
  \ up in a paranoid society divided by class differences. \n\nThe scenery that appears\
  \ though the window slowly transforms from a beautiful, historical center with colonial\
  \ architecture and stone-paved hilly streets into a spectacular coastline with long\
  \ stretches of white beaches bordered by blue oceans and palm trees. When the bus\
  \ turns left, the seemingly infinite coastline makes place for dusty and densely\
  \ populated streets full of slums.\n\nThe bus is driving uphill on the last paved\
  \ road in Bairro da Paz, the driver parks the bus and walks out. I take a deep breath\
  \ and with mixed feelings of heroism, naivety and insecurity I do the same. I pass\
  \ an old statue of a stained white dove, a small symbol of peace and hear a young\
  \ male\xB4s voice announcing the social-cultural agenda for next week. The loud\
  \ voice is being transmitted through big, old speakers attached to the top of electricity\
  \ poles, spread out on all corners of the streets. \n\nI follow the wires that connect\
  \ the analogue speakers to the central source in the radio station and arrive at\
  \ a small, stone house with a door made of metal bars and a sign saying \u201CRadio\
  \ Avanzar\u201D. Rafael, the coordinator, opens the door with a big smile and sparkling\
  \ eyes. I have a quick glimpse through the small studio where four girls and boys,\
  \ surrounded by wires and cables, are presenting their radio programme and sigh.\
  \ I made it."
