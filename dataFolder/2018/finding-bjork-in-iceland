Text: "As I landed in Keflavik, Iceland\u2019s main airport, my heart raced and a\
  \ few tears formed in the corner of my eyes. I\u2019d been a huge fan of Icelandic\
  \ popstar Bj\xF6rk for so long it felt like a dream to leave warm and sunny Brazil\
  \ and arrive at the Arctic.  I\u2019m not ashamed to say I went to Iceland to make\
  \ a connection with Bj\xF6rk. Not to stalk her, but to walk the paths she\u2019\
  s walked, to experience the place from where she draws so much of her musical inspiration.\n\
  I didn\u2019t take me long to find her. It turned out every local had the same Bj\xF6\
  rkish accent I\u2019ve come to love when they talked to me in English. And some\
  \ sense of whimsy. I\u2019ve had a problem finding my bag and an airport staffer\
  \ smiled at me and said \u201Ckeep the faith, it\u2019ll turn up\u201D. I\u2019\
  m pretty sure it would fit a Bj\xF6rk song.\nTourism is a very important revenue\
  \ source for Iceland, and they are prepared. I was welcomed with warmth in hotels,\
  \ tours and restaurants, which was unusual for a South American travelling Europe.\
  \ But warm hospitality was the only thing that felt close to home. The wide open\
  \ spaces surrounded by mountains (that I was told were volcanos), the black sanded\
  \ beaches, the wooden houses on sheep farms, the green moss-covered rocks, the glaciers,\
  \ the arctic wind, the fact that the sun would go down around midnight and rise\
  \ a couple of hours later (it was summer time), it all had a sense of other-worldliness.\
  \ \nNature is a big part of the Icelandic experience. I began to understand why\
  \ in Bj\xF6rk\u2019s lyrics she seems to have a profound spiritual connection to\
  \ nature. And also why she\u2019s so quirky and peculiar; Icelanders encourage individuality\
  \ and as a country they have their quirks, such as a tendency to believe in elves\
  \ and gnomes. Some of them even build little houses for small magical beings in\
  \ their backyards \u2013 I saw one who always had a light on inside and was really\
  \ scared for a moment. \nIn the end, I didn\u2019t see Bj\xF6rk or any Bj\xF6rk-related\
  \ stuff on this trip but I felt really connected to her, the fierce nature you can\
  \ find everywhere in Iceland, the unusual people and their simple yet rich way of\
  \ life."
