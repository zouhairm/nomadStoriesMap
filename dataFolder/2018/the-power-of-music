Text: "The sun was setting down over the crystal clear water. Another beautiful sunset\
  \ in Nusa Penida. Max and I had been here for two days, it was my second time in\
  \ 3 months. I volunteered at an NGO in Bali for the first 6 weeks before I started\
  \ backpacking. I loved Nusa Penida, it was still pretty secluded here compared to\
  \ Bali, we had the beaches to ourselves almost the whole time, which was a luxury.\n\
  We were sitting outside, with our two new friends that we had met that day. It was\
  \ Balinese Christmas, so we decided to go to one of the temples nearby. Everybody\
  \ was dressed in their traditional clothes, the women were wearing beautiful tops\
  \ with colourful sarongs and the men were wearing white shirts and sarongs. Everybody\
  \ was at the temple. In front of it were lines of people, some were dancing. Everywhere\
  \ were fruits and other food to sacrifice. We had never seen so many and such big\
  \ sacrifices. On a day to day basis, they usually just offer up beautiful flowers.\
  \ We wanted to enter the temple too, but some Hindus at the entrance told us that\
  \ we couldn't, because of our clothes. We were a little bit disappointed, but we\
  \ also understood that this was a really special holiday to them and something that\
  \ we should show respect to. \nSo we went into a reggae bar. We were the only people,\
  \ because everybody else was still at the temple, so we ordered some Tuwak- a palm\
  \ wine, and talked about everything that came to our minds. After two hours, a group\
  \ of maybe 20 young balinese guys came in, still dressed in their traditional clothes.\
  \ We greeted each other, they ordered some Tuwak too and we sat in opposite corners\
  \ of the bar. After a while the owner of the bar started to play some Bob Marley\
  \ classics. Slowly both of our groups started singing. First quietly, then louder\
  \ and louder, which was probably also because of the increasing Tuwak consumption\
  \ on both sides. After a couple of songs, some of the guys stood up and started\
  \ dancing. Max was the first one from our group who joined them. After a while we\
  \ were all dancing and singing to Bob Marley. In between we tried to talk to each\
  \ other but we barely spoke Indonesian and they barely spoke German. But that wasn't\
  \ a problem, because since both of our groups knew the lyrics to Bob Marley, we\
  \ liked each other a lot. Like I already mentioned, both of our groups had ordered\
  \ Tuwak, but they still invited us to join them. So we were all dancing, singing\
  \ and sharing our Tuwak, until the bar closed."
