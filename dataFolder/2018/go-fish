Text: "I awoke to the sound of sheep bah-ing and two young children climbing on top\
  \ of me, their laughs softly twinkling. One of them played an out-of-tune harmonica\
  \ while the other shook me awake. For a moment, I had wondered to myself, \u201C\
  Where am I? How did I get here and who are these children?\u201D\n\nThen, it returned\
  \ to me. Less than forty-eight hours earlier, I had been sitting on Barceloneta\
  \ Beach, where the sand was soft and the air was warm. My bag had vanished, and\
  \ with it, my passport, phone, and credit cards were gone as well. A shock ran through\
  \ my body as I envisioned the toil that lay before me. Nothing feels lonelier and\
  \ more desperate than being stranded in a foreign country with no friends, no family,\
  \ and no money.  \n\nMiraculously, I made it back to Germany, where I at least spoke\
  \ the language. In exchange for room and board, I now worked here, on a small family-run\
  \ farm in Northern Germany. For the past two months, I had been roaming around large\
  \ European cities, eating junk and partying with other American backpackers. Now\
  \ I was herding sick sheep with cries of \u201CShafe, shafe,\u201D in the wee hours\
  \ of the morning and occupying my afternoons with card games between the youngest\
  \ two members of the household.\n\n\u201CGo Fish,\u201D I told Johann in my heavily\
  \ accented German. \u201CHast du eine F\xFCnf?\u201D\n\nHe stared at his cards,\
  \ his eyebrows knitting together in concentration beneath his sweeping blonde hair.\
  \ For someone so young, I found the stern expression that he often wore rather amusing.\
  \ It certainly made his smile all the more endearing.\n\nLisbeth, Johann\u2019s\
  \ mother, wandered into the room. Pulling back a stray curl from her face, she addressed\
  \ me in English, her voice colored by a lyrically British accent. She hoped to join\
  \ us in our game. Johann resolutely refused, still sour about the last game the\
  \ three of us had partaken in. Lisbeth had won.\n\nOne turn later and Johann jumped\
  \ out of his seat, cards flying from his hands. His voice lilted upwards in a cry\
  \ of joy, at last able to announce his victory. What he didn\u2019t know was that\
  \ I had been able to see all of his cards throughout the game. Kleiner Johann had\
  \ me wrapped around his finger. I just couldn\u2019t stand to let him lose at this\
  \ game which he so adored.\n\nAs I sat chuckling at Johann\u2019s glee, surrounded\
  \ by these new friends whom had been strangers to me less than a week before, I\
  \ couldn\u2019t help but laugh at the good fortune which had arisen from my bad\
  \ luck."
