Text: "When I opened my eyes, the room was filled with chickens. Uncertain if I was\
  \ just dreaming, I got off bed and turned on the lights. They were still there,\
  \ staring at me. On the table by the door, a pack of bananas and a handmade map\
  \ that made me feel like Indiana Jones. It was late afternoon the day before and\
  \ the green mountains, as majestic as intimidating, were finally getting closer.\
  \ The setting Sun brought me both gratitude and concern. It was getting dark and\
  \ I was still far away from where I was hoping to pitch my tent that night. Progress\
  \ was slow and all I could hear was the sound of my wheels on a gravel road that\
  \ had suddenly become unforgivingly steep. Smiley children in uniforms were walking\
  \ along the road and often a curious farmer would wave his hat and greet me with\
  \ a friendly Buenas Tardes! I was in the second week of the Ecuadorian leg of my\
  \ bicycle expedition through Latin America, an adventure that had started several\
  \ weeks earlier in Colombia. Pedaling against my thirst, hunger and fatigue, as\
  \ I looked back to see how much ground I had already covered, I saw a small car\
  \ zigzagging its way up. Engulfed by the cloud of dust it left behind, I could barely\
  \ see it slowing down and stopping a few meters ahead. As I got closer, I saw a\
  \ man whose modest stature was in sharp contrast with the magnificent smile he had\
  \ on his face. \u201CWhere are you going to, my friend?\u201D, he asked me. \u201C\
  Isinlivi\u201D, I answered. \u201CI\u2019m Pedro, mucho gusto! We are also going\
  \ there!\u201D. We chatted for a bit, he shared his passion for cycling, I was introduced\
  \ to his wife Magyta and daughter Jhuliana, he wished me luck and drove off. Back\
  \ on my saddle for a final push, it was not long before I saw his car driving back\
  \ to me. \u201CLet\u2019s put your bike in the car, come with us.\u201D, he commanded,\
  \ politely. When we arrived, I helped him to run some errands and got his address\
  \ in Quito so I could send him a postcard. I was about to get my bike in his car\
  \ when he said \u201CCome sleep with us at my mom\u2019s farm.\u201D I couldn\u2019\
  t say no, and a few minutes later I was greeting an elderly lady who was deeply\
  \ puzzled by my appearance and the journey I was undertaking. She ran to fetch some\
  \ fresh vegetables and soon I was having a dinner I will never forget. We talked,\
  \ ate and drunk until we could no more. Before leaving the next morning, Pedro went\
  \ quietly inside my room and left me some food and a map of the trail I had to take.\
  \ I still don\u2019t know if the chickens were already inside when he came in."
