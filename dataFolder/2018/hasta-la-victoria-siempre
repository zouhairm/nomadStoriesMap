Text: "Do you remember where you were when you learned that Fidel Castro died? November\
  \ 25, 2016 is a date that I will never forget because I was in Havana, Cuba when\
  \ the unexpected, but inevitable, occurred. \n\nA week prior, four girlfriends and\
  \ I landed at Jose Marti International Airport. I collected my luggage, exchanged\
  \ some of my U.S. currency for convertible pesos, and, forty minutes later, I arrived\
  \ at an AirBnB in central Havana.  Over the next several days, I took salsa and\
  \ rhumba lessons in Havana. I bought Montecristo's from a tobacco farmer in Vinales\
  \ and I walked up and down Trinidad's cobblestoned streets admiring the city's beautiful\
  \ architecture. After a number of enchanting days on the island,  I returned to\
  \ Havana from Trinidad for my final full day in Cuba. In the morning, I went to\
  \ the Museum of the Revolution to learn about the champions and villains of the\
  \ movement. Afterwards, I stopped by the Museum of Fine Art, which is bursting with\
  \ beautiful, thoughtful and provoking pieces. \n\nIn the evening, my friends and\
  \ I made an attempt to get into Fabrica de Arte Cubano (FAC)-- one of Havana's premiere\
  \ tourist venues. In the hours that I spent there, I alternated between awe, confusion\
  \ and irritation. I looked around and thought, \"Am I in Havana or the Meatpacking\
  \ district? What the hell is going on here?\" Around 11 PM, hours before the venues\
  \ official closing time, my girlfriends and I decided to head back to our AirBnB.\
  \ Strangely, the FAC staff were telling everyone else to leave too, which made for\
  \ a slow, crowded crawl towards the exit.  \n\nBack at the apartment, I was in the\
  \ shower when I heard my friend shout, \"Fidel Castro is dead.\" I initially thought,\
  \ \"Oh my god. That's crazy.\" Followed by, \"Will we be able to go home tomorrow?\
  \ Should I be concerned?\" You can't go to sleep when history is happening so I\
  \ hopped out of the shower, got dressed and walked to the Paseo del Prado to see\
  \ what, if anything, was happening. I noticed uniformed police on the streets, but\
  \ also saw teenagers making out.  One Cuban, carrying a can of beer in each hand,\
  \ said \"Fidel is mi padre.\"  The following day, another Cuban noted that there\
  \ were \"fiestas\" in Miami, while yet another gentlemen shouted an obscenity that\
  \ suggested he viewed Castro's death as positive.\n\nThe last thing I expected when\
  \ I traveled to Cuba was that El Jefe Maximo would die, and that the legacy and\
  \ imprint of such a controversial figure would nevertheless be so prominent."
