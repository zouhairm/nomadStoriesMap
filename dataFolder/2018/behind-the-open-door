Text: "I\u2019d exchanged morning and evening greetings with my temporary Moroccan\
  \ neighbour, but nowhere near enough words had passed between us to constitute the\
  \ British notion of friendship. So when he approached me with a beaming smile, welcoming\
  \ me into his home on my third evening in Fez, I was apprehensive that I should\
  \ decline.\n\nEveryone was keen to caution me about Morocco. \"Consider covering\
  \ your hair\" they said, \"don\u2019t even expose your wrists\" and \"wear a wedding\
  \ band!\" \"They\u2019ll be after every penny you got too!\" However, these warnings\
  \ faded with the brightness of his smile and I was curious about what the buzz of\
  \ excitement through the doors behind him could be.\n \nHe gestured me into his\
  \ home and the buzz exploded into the sounds of excited chatter. The room was awash\
  \ with brightly colored kaftan, trays of tiny tea glasses and piles of intricate\
  \ biscuits, all surrounding a cot containing the host\u2019s 7 day old baby girl.\
  \ This was Aqiqah, the Islamic celebration of a new child.\n\nI felt under-dressed-\
  \ the women were glamorously floating around in their sequined gowns whilst I was\
  \ doused in a specially bought pair of dull, baggy harems, long sleeves and a scarf,\
  \ dusty from a day of wandering through the warm maze of farm animals, fruit trolleys\
  \ and leather stalls of the Medina. But they welcomed me like an old friend, constantly\
  \ topping up my incredibly sweet mint tea, passing around biscuits and patiently\
  \ trying to communicate with me in my broken French. This was a far cry from the\
  \ images that, despite the best intentions, the phrase \u2018Islamic country\u2019\
  \ had previously conjured up in my media propagated mind- black veils, suppressed\
  \ women and a hate for westerners. I had also been taught that Muslims regarded\
  \ music as haram (forbidden) so was taken aback when a cousin started to sing, accompanied\
  \ by his brother on a tambourine and his sister on the guitar. As the music filled\
  \ the room, everyone started to dance around their newest family member. A lady\
  \ held out her hand to me, leading me to the dance floor, silently teaching me the\
  \ moves. We danced around the baby providing blessings for its journey ahead.\n\n\
  The generosity of the Moroccans\u2019 who have a reputation as money grabbers left\
  \ me speechless. Not only had I been welcomed into their home and fed but they had\
  \ shared a rite of passage with me and taught me more than I could have discovered\
  \ in any guide book.\nThe beauty of Morocco is behind doors which are open to us,\
  \ but we must choose to accept the invite."
