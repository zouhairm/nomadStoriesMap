Text: "It was a wild scent, untamed smoke. Somewhere between the sweet hickory of\
  \ a campfire and the alarming scent of burning trash in the street. It permeated\
  \ my nostrils the second I landed. To me, El Salvador smelled like fire. With over\
  \ 20 volcanoes, black sand coating its beaches, and remnants of a devastating civil\
  \ war, smoke is everywhere. Although I have the luxury of calling myself a Salvadoran-American,\
  \ the smells, sights, and tastes of El Salvador linger in me no matter where I am.\
  \ \n Everywhere you look. Green. A stark contrast to the country\xB4s scent. It's\
  \ hard to see where the mountainside stops and the ground begins. A glance off the\
  \ trail's edge is a dizzying rush. As you approach the foliage, people are splashing\
  \ about in the shimmering pools of the Chorros de la Calera, one of the hidden treasures\
  \ of Juayua. Within the cascades there are locals, tourists, and wandering adventurers;\
  \ they all blend together like muddied paintbrushes. A lovely splatter of green,\
  \ brown, and sparklets of white. \n Later that week, I visited one of the country\u2019\
  s water parks in Ichanmichen. A breeze came by and my mouth watered, there were\
  \ fresh pupusas and mangoes. Whereas pupusas are the epitome of Salvadoran cuisine,\
  \ what I remember most are mangoes and the girls who sold them. I had spent the\
  \ afternoon playing with them, splashing around and going down slides. \nThey wrung\
  \ their clothes and reached for their sacks with the remaining unsold mangoes. Chanclas\
  \ on and sacks ready, they turned to leave. I was taking photos and aimed towards\
  \ them. They both immediately shielded their faces and twisted out of the frame\
  \ abruptly. I was naive to think it was acceptable to photograph them. I let them\
  \ know I hadn't taken the photo, they hesitantly faced me with expressions I hadn't\
  \ seen upon 11 year olds. The older one scowled, \u201CIF we let you take our pictures\
  \ , are you going to remember us, come back here, and then what, bring us clothes,\
  \ money?\u201D It was clear they didn\u2019t want to be trivialized into some token\
  \ of a souvenir through a photograph. The air was stiff and I was taken aback by\
  \ the girl's candor. Her open ended questions exposed every privilege I had already\
  \ grown up with that they would not know. I enjoyed the rest of my trip to El Salvador,\
  \ a homeland away from the home I knew, with a bittersweet taste of the mangos from\
  \ the girls who I could have been, from the home I could have known, from the place\
  \ where I would be, selling mangoes."
