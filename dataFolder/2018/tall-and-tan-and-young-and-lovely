Text: "My friend, Michael's, first assignment as a diplomat was in Rio de Janeiro,\
  \ Brazil. His Christmas letter included an invitation to visit his new home. I responded\
  \ immediately hoping my spring break dates would work with his schedule. They did.\
  \ \n\nHis home was right across the street from Leblon Beach, which abuts Ipanema,\
  \ which borders Copacabana. My mind devised a repeat playlist of \"Her name is Rio\
  \ and she dances on the sand\", \"At the Copa\" and \"The Girl from Ipanema\". \
  \ I am tall and planned to become tan and lovely. \n\nEach morning I would walk\
  \ by the beach volleyball and soccer players. Then I would sip on some fresh coconut\
  \ water before finding my spot on the beach. Then I would let myself be lulled into\
  \ nirvana by the sounds of the waves.\n\nOne evening, my friend pointed out the\
  \ restaurant, \"Garota de Ipanema\" (Portuguese for Girl from Ipanema)  saying that\
  \ it was where the hit song was written and had pretty good food. I planned to visit\
  \ it on my last day. Michael suggested that before I go, I walk around the lagoon\
  \ where the upcoming Olympics would be held. That seemed like a great idea; however,\
  \ I hadn't factored in the fact that in this location I could no longer see my landmark,\
  \ Dos Irm\xE5os. Although I do not speak Portuguese, I am not afraid to try to speak\
  \ Spanish which seemed to work in Rio. I approached several people stating that\
  \ I was looking for the restaurant called Garota de Ipanema. One man had a large\
  \ video camera which made him seem like a good choice, but, alas, he was from Sao\
  \ Paulo; however, he pointed to a man who told me the exact address. Jackpot! He\
  \ gave clear directions and I was on my way.\n\nI found the restaurant, enjoyed\
  \ a lunch and then my Jackpot man entered. I shook his hand, thanking him for his\
  \ help in finding it. He smiled and when I returned to my seat, he began moving\
  \ tables. I decided he was meeting a big group. He walked out. I wondered it this\
  \ space would too small for his group. I watched him out the window and saw the\
  \ camera-wielding man. There seemed to be a reporter with long blond hair speaking\
  \ into the camera.  Jackpot man re-entered and when I asked what was happening,\
  \ he said, \"She's coming.\" I asked who was coming. He said \"The girl from Ipanema.\"\
  \ As I tried to sputter, \"The real one?\", she pretty much walked into my arms.\
  \ \n\nShe was lovely and engaging, asking where I was from, telling me she'd enjoyed\
  \ Chicago. It was clear to me that 54 years after the song was written, she could\
  \ still make people go \"ah\"."
