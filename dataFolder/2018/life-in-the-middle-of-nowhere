Text: "When I stepped out of the bus in Alice Springs the blazing heat struck me.\
  \ For some unknown reason it felt like home even though I\u2019ve only been there\
  \ for a minute. I loved walking the empty streets of Alice, shopping the few boutiques\
  \ and strolling along the Todd River \u2013 a dry riverbed with deep red sand surrounded\
  \ by stunning yet eerie hills. The atmosphere of the city that was so far away from\
  \ everything else in Australia was totally unique. For the next few days I climbed\
  \ the long staircase to the top of Kings Canyon, walked through the valley of the\
  \ winds in Kata Tjuta and was fascinated by all the different colours and sites\
  \ of Uluru. Somehow, I could not get enough of the red sand, dry scrubs and countless\
  \ stars of the most deserted region of Australia. Then I ran out of money.\nThis\
  \ was when the real adventure began. I was desperately looking for a job and the\
  \ only thing I could find was work as a station hand which was to start the next\
  \ day. Not knowing what to anticipate I grabbed my bag and drove 330kms away from\
  \ everything and right into the desert. This journey alone was incredible. I saw\
  \ wildlife I would have never encountered in the city, was dead scared to blow a\
  \ tyre and so relieved when I finally arrived. When I was shown around the vast\
  \ cattle station I was instantly hooked. The last thing I expected was to fall in\
  \ love with one the most remote areas on the planet. I felt like in a TV show where\
  \ strong and independent Australian women run a farm against all odds. The next\
  \ three months were like a dream I never wanted to wake up from. The owners of the\
  \ cattle station were remarkable people \u2013 stubborn yet full of strength and\
  \ determination to live out in that hard, dry land. They taught me to ride a horse,\
  \ how to dispose of a snake in the house and to navigate without a GPS. I learned\
  \ how to muster a mob of cattle and how to draft them before loading them on a truck.\
  \ Everyone almost laughed died of laughter when I got chased by a bull. Out there\
  \ in the middle of nowhere other rules apply. But I felt like this was my heart\u2019\
  s home. Never again I looked into another night time sky so full of stars, saw another\
  \ sunrise with so many shades of red and orange, never again was I anywhere so far\
  \ away from anything else yet felt so close to myself. The life those people lead\
  \ is so different from the one I have on the other side of the planet but still\
  \ I connected with them so deeply. Being a jillaroo \u2013 an Australian cowgirl\
  \ \u2013 was the most amazing experience of my life."
