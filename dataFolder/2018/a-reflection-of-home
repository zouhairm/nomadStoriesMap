Text: "I make my way to the black metal gate that never quite closes fully and see\
  \ my grandmother standing by her door. It has been almost a decade since I last\
  \ visited Mangalore and for the first time I have come alone. Her wide smile mirrors\
  \ mine before it breaks into a flurry of questions, \u201CHow-was-the-journey?-Did-you-sleep?-Are-you-hungry?\u201D\
  \ \n\nAs she readies breakfast, I wander through the house looking for changes,\
  \ feet adjusting to red oxide floor and tiled staircase. A steady ticking follows\
  \ me as I realise every room has a clock and somehow it\u2019s the only place where\
  \ time stands still. All the furniture is in the same place, my 10-year-old self\
  \ smiles out at me from the same family pictures on the same shelves, and I am relieved\
  \ to find the little box containing sweets still on the dining table, fully stocked.\
  \ \n\nOnly the computer has been moved downstairs and my grandmother eats in the\
  \ kitchen when she doesn\u2019t have company. The parts of the house she dwells\
  \ in seem to keep shrinking. She laughs and tells me she has shrunk by two inches;\
  \ her 'salwar' hangs loose about her feet like her house. \n\nSo, when I ask to\
  \ see some old photo albums, she tells me to look for them myself in the cupboards\
  \ upstairs. I don\u2019t know which one she means, so I open them all one-by-one.\
  \ A white plastic bag labelled with the initials of an old textile shop spills out\
  \ all of my mother\u2019s certificates and report cards. I am suddenly aware of\
  \ a life that existed before I did, one that I am somehow connected to by space\
  \ and blood. I see paint peeling from the walls uncovering memories and I want to\
  \ ask the room to tell me stories as it watched her grow. I am answered with glimpses\
  \ of her reflection in my face in the mirror before I am interrupted by my grandmother\
  \ calling me to go to the local shop with her. \n\nWe walk together as she holds\
  \ my arm for support and smiles at everyone we pass. Mangalore is the kind of city\
  \ small enough that pretty much everyone knows each other; where the shopkeeper\
  \ knows you by name and grocery list! \nAt the shop, she starts her introduction,\
  \ \u201CThis is my\u2013\u201C\n\u201CGranddaughter?\u201D the shopkeeper cuts in,\
  \ \u201CShe looks like you.\u201D They continue to talk, and I hold her hand a little\
  \ tighter, filled with a sense of belonging, for if a local had made the connection,\
  \ I was no longer an outsider and I was ready to embrace this as my homecoming."
