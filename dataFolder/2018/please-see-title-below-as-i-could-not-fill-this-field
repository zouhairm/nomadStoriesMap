Text: "Bungy Capital the Final Resting Place for Intrepid Aussie Family\n\nMy husband,\
  \ Ben, myself and our children, India and Ryder, are the protagonists of the Smithward\
  \ story, a cautionary tale of an Australian family who dared to take a leap of faith\
  \ in New Zealand and may not return. Okay, perhaps overly dramatic, but it certainly\
  \ seems some folks back home follow our journey from Smith to \"Smuth\" with this\
  \ degree of trepidation. \n\nOnce young, carefree nomads shouldering a backpack\
  \ each of worldly possessions, Ben and I were suddenly approaching forty, fearful\
  \ parenthood had clipped our wings beyond a dutiful flight to visit grandparents\
  \ each Christmas. We bought the \"forever home\", settled the kids into Brisbane\
  \ schools, had a tight clique and seemed to be ticking all the right boxes, but\
  \ still, wanderlust was vying with the kids to tug on the apron strings. Luckily,\
  \ fate intervened and an online job search turned up Ben's dream role. In New Zealand.\
  \ \n\nWe brashly sold everything bar our house to embark on a 3-hour journey across\
  \ the ditch with 2 kids, 5 suitcases, and the audacity to pull up stumps in Arrowtown,\
  \ a village we had previously experienced for only 72 hours. The sleet welcoming\
  \ us to Queenstown Airport quickly progressed to hail as Ben drew on the Tetris\
  \ skills of his misspent youth to wedge luggage, booster seats and hangry children\
  \ into a rental SUV. Trepidation rising, I shivered in the front seat, crossing\
  \ my fingers for both warmth and luck.\n\nThe gold-rich veins of the Arrow River\
  \ had determined the fortunes of kiwis and migrants for centuries and the Smiths\
  \ were just another family trying their luck. Aussie friends congratulated us, \"\
  What an amazing family adventure,\" before wistfully adding, \"We should do that\"\
  . Facebook photos earned comments \"Just another postcard\" or \"From a fairytale\"\
  . \n\nDespite the daily onset of selfie-stick wielding visitors viewing the idyllic\
  \ village facade as a movie set, the novelty of living in this holiday mecca doesn't\
  \ seem to wane. How soon we became \"local\" enough to join the Facebook whinge\
  \ about tourists and bemoan the loss of secret spots exposed on TripAdvisor. Our\
  \ family life is richer for the challenges and adventures we shared forging a thick\
  \ and fast connection with Arrowtown's heritage, landscape, and people. Much to\
  \ our surprise, and perhaps the chagrin of some folks back home, the bond the Smiths\
  \ developed with the bunjy capital of the world has proven to be much more than\
  \ just a holiday fling."
