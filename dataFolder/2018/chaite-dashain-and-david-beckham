Text: "The head looked up at me with a rudely lolling tongue. Goats were straining\
  \ at rope leashes, desperately resisting their own tumble down the hillside; the\
  \ crowd was thick with blood and cheer, and I looked to Char as if to say, \u2018\
  What are we doing here?\u2019\n \nWe had arrived in Pokhara a week previously. After\
  \ following a trad gap year trail through India, we were keen to leave the airless\
  \ streets and escape to higher ground in the foothills of Nepal. This was where\
  \ we met our guide, Nabu. He was a slight man with a twitchy, rabbit-like face and\
  \ a fondness for rice wine at the end of a day\u2019s hike. As such, evenings were\
  \ filled with his tales of extramarital exploits and our wide-eyed assurances that\
  \ we knew exactly what he was going through - we didn\u2019t - and yummy noises\
  \ as we took another bitter swig. It was after one such night that he invited us\
  \ to celebrate Chaite Dashain with him in his hometown.\n \nNabu\u2019s village\
  \ was tucked off one of the few main roads with wooden houses pressed together amongst\
  \ heavy greenery, and trees which were festooned with colourful flags that flapped\
  \ urgently in the breeze. We were welcomed by his family with eager smiles and talk\
  \ of UK football, particularly David Beckham, but there was little time for in depth-David;\
  \ the festivities had already begun in earnest on the hillside and our group was\
  \ quickly sucked into the throng. Bodies were packed tightly together, the scent\
  \ of a hot afternoon hanging to us all, mixed with damp excitement. It was then\
  \ that the first body fell.\n \nA goat\u2019s head, freshly cut and bleeding freely,\
  \ came bouncing down the hill to land in front of us. The torso fell next, hitting\
  \ the earth with a thud and bringing whoops with it before someone dashed in to\
  \ drag it away. Moments later a second came, this time slightly off-course so one\
  \ of the kids - a small, wiry boy - kicked it back to join the rest which were now\
  \ dropping thick and fast, some face down in the dirt while others peered up with\
  \ that same glassy stare.\n \nChar looked at me then back to the head, and we started\
  \ to laugh at the absurdity of it all - just awkward giggles at first but picking\
  \ up speed, both feeling thrilled and giddy. The first goat to fall had now been\
  \ skinned, sliced and left sizzling on a spit, with hunks of its flesh being passed\
  \ around the group for tasting. We whooped with the crowd and gladly accepted the\
  \ warm meat from Nabu, chewing openly as juices ran from our grinning mouths."
