Text: "Here sat a landlocked Texan (Amarillo) who had never seen the ocean.Any ocean.Yes,\
  \ I'm from a state that if you want and can afford to drive 12 hours then Galveston\
  \ will give you fishing boats, dolphins and LOTS of water.At the ripe old age of\
  \ 30 something I finally saw it.Yes, I was an over awed tourist in my own state.It\
  \ happens.\nMy first trip to anywhere.Ever.And I was fixing (real Texan word, look\
  \ it up) to get on a monstrosity of a cruise ship with my mother and her husband's\
  \ family. If you knew family dynamics then I had already earned my badge of patience\
  \ prior to getting an hour from the house.\nThis was prior to 9-11 so pre-boarding\
  \ was just a look from a bored employee every 100 feet or so and a noncommittal\
  \ wave through to the next check point.By the 4th one I was becoming a jaded traveler\
  \ myself.Then I see the glass walled, twisting gangplank and I was 12 again.It was\
  \ real.I was actually going somewhere and the price of that blue covered passport\
  \ wasn't a waste!Can a person my age skip?I did, at least for the first couple of\
  \ upward twists and then age made it impossible but the excitement didn't wane.\
  \ \nPeople in pristine white uniforms are greeting everyone as the gangplank transforms\
  \ into an actual ship floor. Made it! They aren't getting me off now.\nWe get through\
  \ the crush of finding cabins, people unable to find medications and the necessary\
  \ safety precautions of a sinking ship. We are off in just a matter of a few hours.\
  \ WooHoo. Food and drinks are flowing and meds have been located. \nMy first true\
  \ emotional moment came while sitting at a deck table and seeing flying fish. Real\
  \ flying fish. They aren't just the sea's jackalope. They are real and amazing.\
  \ \nFirst stop, Cancun. My second emotional moment comes when I see these little\
  \ black 'thingies' in the pristine blue waters. Jellyfish. Jaw drop. Little teeny\
  \ tiny jellyfish. Turns out that all cabs have 8 indentions in the passenger side\
  \ of the dashboard and 2 underneath. These are the impressions of all previous tourists\
  \ that have the innate bravery of sitting in the front seat. No Six Flags ride can\
  \ give the kind of thrill that a cabby who is thinking about the next fare can.\
  \ \nNext stop, the ruins of a recently uncovered Mayan Temple. The tears came. I\
  \ stood away from the group and just looked. THIS is reality. Not the ship, my mothers\
  \ annoying bedroom habits or the continually lost medications.\nI was a lifelong\
  \ traveler at that moment. I will never tire of seeing the world."
