Text: "Excitement bubbled within like the dormant Hekla that beckoned an eager traveller\
  \ from the spicy heart of Asia to the reclusiveness of Iceland. Boarding the flight\
  \ from Goa, I looked forward to a destination most refrain from adding to their\
  \ itinerary. \nFinally, after a second break at Oslo, I peered down to a rather\
  \ small airport and scattered dwellings of people who still believe in elves. Keflavik\
  \ was unlike what I had expected! \u201CYou expected to see crowded buildings, busy\
  \ highways and stretching greenery,\u201D an Icelander smiled wryly, as the plane\
  \ yearned to embrace the frozen land. \u201CWelcome to the unexpected. Welcome to\
  \ Iceland!\u201D \nMy backpack was empty, but I had come loaded with expectations\
  \ and warmth certainly was not on the list!\nFilled with awe, I drove past Harfnarfjodur,\
  \ towards Reykjavik. The white topography, empty roads, sparse population, harsh\
  \ climate, a difficult language was contrary to what I was used to. Yet, the uniqueness\
  \ was so alluring that within hours, like most that come here, I too did not want\
  \ to return.\nReykjavik stood draped in its inimitable charm with Hallgrimskirkja\
  \ standing tall. I drove on as my host lived in a quaint village called Laugarvatn,\
  \ close to Sellfoss and soon crossed the famous Thingviller, Europe\u2019s oldest\
  \ parliament.  \nI was expected to take the Ring Road, rush past tourist destinations\
  \ from Vik to Seydisfjordur and Akuyeri to Reykholt, encounter a rendezvous with\
  \ the aurora, awe at the spurting geysers, marvel the beautiful horses, enjoy warm\
  \ springs, discover black beach and icy caves, besides encountering warm Icelanders.\
  \ I now know why Justin Bieber frequents these parts and I\u2019m sure he\u2019\
  ll be glad to \u2018show you\u2019!\nBut things could go horribly wrong once you\
  \ get hungry, as that\u2019s when your worst nightmares come alive! I mean sour\
  \ ram testicles, blood pudding and horse meat may be palatable during crisis, but\
  \ fermented shark, blubber and fish stomach is unimaginable.\nAh, I forget to tell\
  \ you that I was here to launch my book (Iceland Tales \u2013 Elves of Harfnarfjodur\
  \ & Other Stories) and inverting initial apprehensive expectations, I began with\
  \ \u201CIceland is a warm nation,\u201D much to the amusement of the book-loving\
  \ crowd, that broke into unending applause as I added \u201Ca nation is known by\
  \ its people and since Icelanders are warm, Iceland is a warm country.\u201D \n\
  Yes, warmth was the last thing on my mind. But my trip did educate me on perspectives\
  \ not encountered before \u2013 indeed Iceland is a warm country!"
