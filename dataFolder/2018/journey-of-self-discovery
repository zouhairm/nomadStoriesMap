Text: "One of my Korean friends from Malaysian school invited me to visit her in Korea\
  \ and I went to her for two weeks. I stayed in her house with her family and observed\
  \ Korean culture very keenly. My friend took me to Jeju Island and we spent one\
  \ week there. I fell in love with the Korean food like chahan, kimba and tappoki.\
  \ Even though we spend two weeks together I was not opening up to her and her family.\
  \ She was a good friend of mine but due to the fear of losing her I did not open\
  \ to her. I thought she will start to dislike me because any of my random habit\
  \ and I did not wanted her to dislike me. So I stayed quiet and reserved. Two weeks\
  \ passed and I came back to Japan. I constrained myself in the small Pakistani community\
  \ in Japan. I learnt nothing from Japan; my mind was not ready to accept the change.\
  \ I did not see the beauty Japan have, unlike any other country. The beautiful Sakura\
  \ in Kyoto, fast life in Tokyo, noodles of Osaka, the art and the complex simplicity\
  \ behind it that Japan has to offer, Peace, safety, and technology nothing was fantasizing\
  \ me, I just wanted time to pass. In the next holidays we planned a family trip\
  \ to Dubai. We experienced dessert safari, watched belly dance and ate different\
  \ Arabian food.Everyone was so welcoming, we became friends in no time, we cooked\
  \ together, ate together, watched movies together.  I could not believe that I have\
  \ so many friends from all over the world and they were willing to accept me as\
  \ I am. Life is nothing without passion and travelling gave passion to my life.\
  \ Things aren\u2019t bad every time, sometimes things are just different and that\
  \ sense is developed from traveling and becoming friends with different people.\
  \ Accumulating thoughts about others without talking to them is like a dead relation,\
  \ benefits none but waste your time only. Now that I\u2019ve learnt so much, I want\
  \ to make chances for the people of my village to be able to travel around the globe\
  \ or at least know about the world in order to have passion in their life."
