Text: "I have to confess: I love yurts: their roundness, their portability, the way\
  \ they seamlessly fit into the landscape. I even love the word \u201Cyurt\u201D\
  \ which is so economical. My boyfriend and I decided to go to Kyrgyzstan to seek\
  \ our own personal \u201Cyurt\u201D experience because it is still largely undeveloped,\
  \ has pristine rivers and ancient forests. Herders still live in yurts and raise\
  \ yaks, sheep, ponies and even two-humped camels. Kyrgyzstan is drop-dead gorgeous,\
  \ inexpensive, safe and full of people whose culture requires hospitality as a point\
  \ of honor. Our first yurt camp was located on Issyk Kul, the world's second largest\
  \ freshwater alpine lake. It is located incongruously in the middle of a desert.\
  \ The snow-capped mountains melt into the lake, making the water so cold that it\
  \ is painful to swim for more than a few minutes. I wondered why the Kyrgyz named\
  \ it Issyk Kul which means \u201Cwarm lake.\u201D Do they have a perverse sense\
  \ of humor or did they merely mean that it was warm compared to other Kyrgyz lakes?\
  \ \n\nThe floor of our yurt was covered by felt carpets and hung with colorful tapestries.\
  \ It had a cozy barnyard aroma and a movable skylight to let in more light or seal\
  \ off the dome for more warmth. On the down side, we found out yurts can leak when\
  \ it rains. \n\nAs a vegetarian, I avoided the national dish: besbarmak, horse head\
  \ on noodles. Our cook had never met a vegetarian and was puzzled by me. However,\
  \ she \"solved\" the problem by simply removing the big mutton chunks from my bowl\
  \ with her fingers. Thank God for the black bread! One night, our hosts made an\
  \ impromptu \u201Cdisco\u201Dyurt, dressed us in traditional clothes and we danced\
  \ together for hours. The next day, we hiked to a collection of mud huts. On the\
  \ way, we met Irkun. I started a conversation in my primitive Russian. The next\
  \ thing we knew, Irkun had invited us to his home and we were seated on a kang,\
  \ an elevated area on the floor, along with Irkun\u2019s toothless mother, his brother,\
  \ wife and many children. One of his daughters brought tea, naan and some fresh\
  \ milk from an unknown mammal. When we left, Irkun insisted on giving us a wheel\
  \ of bread and roses from his garden. Mama hugged me goodbye as if we had known\
  \ each other forever. We stopped at the only \"store\" and my boyfriend told Irkun\
  \ to pick out something he liked. He picked vodka, then insisted we do shots with\
  \ him to toast world peace. We were tipsy when we finally lurched back to our yurt\
  \ but we felt we had done our part for world peace."
