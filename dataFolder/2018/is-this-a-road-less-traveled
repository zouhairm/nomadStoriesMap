Text: "\u201CThe Cinque Terre are five self-contained villages-Monterosso al Mare,\
  \ Vernazza, Corniglia, Manarola and Riomaggiore...\u201D: I was reading in the brochure\
  \ when suddenly the boat tilted to one side so hard that some of us almost fell\
  \ into the sea. This was a sure sign that we were approaching one of the villages\
  \ and the passengers were rushing to one side of the boat to take pictures. I was\
  \ high on caffeine and gelato, so nothing was going to bother me for some time:\
  \ not even the fact that it took us more than 6 hours and 3 trains to travel a distance\
  \ of 260 km (riding a burro would be faster). \nOur apartment for the weekend was\
  \ located right in the center of La Spezia, with the windows facing to a church\
  \ which meant charming view for most of the day, and an alarm for the morning. In\
  \ fact, the bells were so loud that I thought that Valeria and Francois, my two\
  \ friends, had decided to joke on me and transported me to the bell tower while\
  \ I was sleeping. La Spezia was as Italian as it could get: a pandemonium of street\
  \ life: couples zipping past on Vespas, laundry hanging across the streets, loud\
  \ conversations over cappuccinos. \nThe hike that we planned for the next morning\
  \ got delayed by the mysterious events of late breakfast, and series of gelato and\
  \ coffee stops. By the time we were ready to hike, the sun was ready to kick as\
  \ heavily; it was 2 pm. Imagine how excited Valeria and me were at the exact moment\
  \ we climbed the first stone step; a split second before we realized that we would\
  \ have to climb gazillion more. The trail that we had picked was the longest. I\
  \ was conveniently using my photography as an excuse for my stops meantime questioning\
  \ my life choices, Valeria was secretly hating me. Every now and then our not-so-silent\
  \ complaints were interrupted by stunning views and short conversations with other\
  \ hikers but nothing had prepared us for the view as we rounded a corner and caught\
  \ a glimpse of Vernazza and her little harbor. There we gave up the plan to continue\
  \ our hiking in favor of cold prosecco and sunbathing on the rocks.  \n\nThe last\
  \ day we kept village-hopping on the local train, tasting more gelato and sciacchet\xE0\
  \ and just wandering through the maze of stairs and tiny terraces and tangled streets\
  \ while virtuously escaping the crowds. All the views of the blue sea that kept\
  \ popping at every turn were so postcard perfect, that left us in a constant Awe\
  \ state of mind. It was such a shame that we had to take our three slow trains back\
  \ home."
