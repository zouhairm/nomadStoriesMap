Text: "Arriving at Al-Khazneh, \"The Treasure\", one of the most famous monuments\
  \ of Petra, all you can find are camels and Bedouins inviting tourists to take a\
  \ stroll. A1-hour ride costs around US$ 75,00, which means that traveling with a\
  \ low budget, the camel ride would go on for another time.\nThe fact of not making\
  \ the tour ride, however, didn\u2019t stop me from being enchanted with those animals.\
  \ At one point, I saw a small caramel-colored one, which seems extremely docile.\
  \ When I approached, the Bedouin on his side allows me to touch it. \"His name is\
  \ Abu. He\u2019s only 5 years old. Almost a cub.\u201D.\n\u201CAlmost a cub?!\u201D\
  . Abu was huge! His head gets to be more than half my height. When I start to cuddle\
  \ his neck, he lowers it, so I can do the same thing to his head. Of course, I melt\
  \ all over the camel. Without realizing it, I start talking to him in Portuguese,\
  \ in the same way as we talk to babies. So, a group of Bedouins start laughing behind\
  \ me.\nOne of the Bedouins approached. His name was Solomon and he wants to know\
  \ more about me. I say that I am Brazilian traveler and that I\u2019m enchanted\
  \ by camels since my aunt gave me a book about a woman who crossed the Outback desert\
  \ with three of them. I tell Solomon that I had no idea that they were so difficult\
  \ to tame. \"Ow, that\u2019s so fucking true!\u201D he laughs. Solomon is the owner\
  \ of the herd and camel tamer. Born in Petra, he lives today from the tourist\u2019\
  s rides. \"Have you ever ridden a camel?\". \"Never!\", I reply. \"So, you need\
  \ to ride girl!\". But I refused. \"Sorry, Solomon, but it's too expensive for me.\
  \ I can't. Really. \" He then looks at me and say, \"So let's go!\" \nI quickly\
  \ answer for fear of getting into a trap \"Look, Solomon\u2026\u201D, but he interrupts\
  \ me \"Hey lady! Bedouins don't make friends for money!\" Immediately he gives a\
  \ command to Abu. The camel descends on its two front legs and puts the two back\
  \ on the ground. Seeing that I'm astonished, Solomon takes my purse out and snaps\
  \ into the saddle helping me to go up. \"Hold on Now! \" And in another command,\
  \ Abu lifts me up carrying my 63 kilos of pure perplexity.\nIn front, Solomon goes\
  \ with his camel and behind three more Bedouins escorted me as a princess. After\
  \ half an hour, Solomon brings me back to the hall of Al-Khazneh and gives the same\
  \ commands, so Abu could put me on the ground. I have no words and my eyes couldn\u2019\
  t hide my gratefulness. Bedouins don't make friends for money. Even because, certain\
  \ things in this life are priceless!"
