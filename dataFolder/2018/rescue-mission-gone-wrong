Text: "It started when I reached Katmandu for a church conference for three days.\
  \ The earthquake 2015 happened and suddenly people starts screening and I hear crying\
  \ and people calling out their Gods. I took a deep breath cause I thought that I\
  \ am not gonna live if I don't move out of the house that I was in and left Katmandu\
  \ next day. \nAfter a week, I returned back to Katmandu because I wanted to help\
  \ people to survive the aftermath of the earthquake. So, I packed my backpack and\
  \ went to help people who were trapped in remote places of Dhading. \nMe and my\
  \ sister went to reacue children, who were trapped there for a week. We took 8 hr\
  \ bus ride and 8 hrs walk up to the hills and finally reached the place called Jarlang.\
  \ \nWe're too tired and we slept on a cow shade because there were no house in that\
  \ area. \nNext day we visited people in that village who couldn't go to the area\
  \ where there was food. Children were stuck there with no food. \nWe saw the situation\
  \ was not good for children. So, we decided to take them to the Dhading town to\
  \ provide food and shelter. \nSo, after few days, we took them to the Dhading town\
  \ and provided them some good food and cloths and shelter. \nBut because the were\
  \ so many who were in need, we decided to take them to Katmandu for proper medical\
  \ care, food and shelter and one of the school offered us to give them shelter and\
  \ also study time to help them focus on something.\nWe agreed and went to talk to\
  \ Cheif of police of that area to permit us to take them and return them when things\
  \ will be better in their village. We took written permission from the parents and\
  \ got ok from the police. \nWe took 2 buses with children to Katmandu and went straight\
  \ to Child welfare office to let them know that they permit us to take care of them.\
  \ They gave us permit to take care of them. \nAfter few days of taking care of the\
  \ children, we came to know that somebody sued us for child trafficking. \nWe were\
  \ put in custody for 17 days in Dhading. No one told us who did it and why. After\
  \ showing them our documents, they didn't release us. They ask us stupid questions\
  \ and if we ask them, they will not answer us. \nEvery child with parents came and\
  \ told the police that they knew where the kids were going and they are the one\
  \ to allow it. Still they didn't let us. After 17 days of unknown state of our future,\
  \ we were told that we can go. \nWhen we came out of the jail, we came to know that\
  \ it was the guy from Child welfare office sued us. Still don't know why?"
