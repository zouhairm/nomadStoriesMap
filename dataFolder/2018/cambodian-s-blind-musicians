Text: "I heard that Ankor Wat was a massive tourist trap but I couldn\u2019t resist\
  \ the allure of the ancient temples. The closest city of Siem Reap boasted several\
  \ attractions. There were the majestic waterfalls and ancient buddhist temples at\
  \ Mount Kulen. There was the deep emotional scars left by the Khmer Rouge and the\
  \ brutality evident in the killing fields.\n\nYet it was the markets and the people\
  \ I met there that made Cambodia such a phenomenal place. I ventured out in their\
  \ perpetually hot weather and became happily lost in their night markets. The whole\
  \ place that was dead that morning was completely transformed as stalls opened up\
  \ and exploded with lights, music and wares. I was a little overwhelmed by everything\
  \ available. My eyes were caught by the stunning artwork and I couldn\u2019t help\
  \ but buy a picture of Ankor Wat. Like all Cambodians, the man was smiling as he\
  \ happily told me the price. I knew little of bartering and was promptly ripped\
  \ off. It was a few tough lessons but I learned quickly as I continued to explore\
  \ and buy what caught my eye. Before long I had a huge number of bags under my arms\
  \ as I loaded myself up with trinkets, artwork and clothing. By the end, a shop\
  \ keeper said  \u2018You barter well\u2019. My chest swelled with more pride than\
  \ it should have.\n\nIt was about that point, overloaded with bags, when I probably\
  \ needed to get back that some beautiful music broke through the crowds. It was\
  \ so alien to anything else I had heard before that I couldn\u2019t help but to\
  \ try and find it. It became like chasing a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow\
  \ but I eventually found four musicians sitting on a small platform, each playing\
  \ a type of string or woodwind instrument I didn\u2019t recognise. I joined their\
  \ small audience. When I looked closer I noticed that one of them was blind. Surprised,\
  \ I looked at the others and saw each suffered from a similar disability. None of\
  \ it hampered their obvious talent and passion for music. I couldn\u2019t help but\
  \ get caught up in it. I have no idea how long I sat there, enjoying each of their\
  \ songs but at some unspoken cue, the four of them stopped playing. Worried I was\
  \ little too into it, I tried to play it cool and hastily got up and donated some\
  \ money. Each of them gave me a bow of thanks. I learned that their earnings were\
  \ split their own livelihood and going towards people with disabilities like themselves.\
  \ They returned every night and played for hours.  \n\nThey were pretty friggen\
  \ amazing."
