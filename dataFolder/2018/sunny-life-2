Text: "We were driving in the old car along the highway from Sitges, Catalonia, and\
  \ admiring the blueness of the Mediterranean. This picturesque place seemed even\
  \ more impressive, because of the sunset that we could observe. I closed my eyes\
  \ for a while. How did it all begin?\nThis adventure started when I ascended the\
  \ stairs of the metro station. \u201CEl Coll/La Teixonera\u201D. I passed through\
  \ the motorcycle parking and saw an unimposing house, which looked similar to a\
  \ garden. \u201CAqu\xED vive un motero\u201D (\u201CHere lives a biker\u201D). A\
  \ fifty-year-old woman who soon has become one of my best friends. From this moment\
  \ on, time began to fly. Gemma, my host and friend, showed me the city. \nLa Sagrada\
  \ Familia. It is worth of admiration. This art masterpiece is more than just a building\
  \ made of stone. It is alive. The columns inside reminded me of enormous tree bodies,\
  \ each unique and inimitable. The sunlight was slipping through the innumerable\
  \ amount of pieces of multicolored glass, creating an amazing pattern and making\
  \ me feel surrounded by Mother Nature. \nThe next day we went to Sitges \u2013 a\
  \ small town between Barcelona and Tarragona, which is situated on a seaside. This\
  \ place is just a fascinating mix of colors: from the tiny houses in pastel shades\
  \ to the sea of deep blue. And yes, we swam in the Mediterranean in February! Strangers\
  \ passing by, laughing and screaming to us: \u201CUy, que locas!\u201D (\u201COh,\
  \ crazy!\u201D), freezing water and plenty of jokes and laughter \u2013 all of this\
  \ gave me a mix of emotions I\u2019ll never forget.\nThis was my first journey on\
  \ my own. I could expect lots of joy or, on the contrary, the feeling of despair\
  \ and loneliness being surrounded by strangers. However, in reality it was a \u201C\
  sunny\u201D life, filled with the light and warmness. \n\u201CThe last thing I expected\
  \ was that I would leave a piece of my heart here,\u201D I thought, and the plane\
  \ took off."
