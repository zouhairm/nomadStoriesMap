Text: "The warmest day of the year was getting away with it on this December wuthering\
  \ morning. After a two-hour journey from Iquitos, in the Peruvian Amazon, we arrived\
  \ at San Juan de Huashalado. We get off the boat and a very good-hearted young man\
  \ takes us on his truck all the way to the end of the village. It is not big: only\
  \ forty families live there, it\u2019s green, it\u2019s wild; it\u2019s absolutely\
  \ breath-taking. We distinguish a wooden cabin by the end of the river. I\u2019\
  ve never seen colours shine that strongly in one single frame. There, a man named\
  \ Orlando welcomes us into his house with hugs, presents us to his wife Teresa and\
  \ his two younger daughters Wendy and Azucena. They\u2019re a bit shy, I noticed.\
  \ There is this wire inside the house that they use as a volleyball net. And this\
  \ is when I remember how little is needed for them to be just kids.\nThe aim of\
  \ our trip was to meet the most important healer in the area, known as El Abuelo.\
  \ \u201CThe Abuelo is my abuelo\u201D he says. He added that he\u2019ll take us\
  \ there in the morning, but not today, that was the last day of the year. \nWe explored\
  \ the village. Orlando is probably the most famous person that lives in Huashalado.\
  \ He helps and leads people to undergo a natural trip called Ayahuasca. Every single\
  \ person in this village is related to him. He has around ten nieces and even more\
  \ grand-nephews. \nThe thing about Orlando is that he doesn\u2019t expect anything\
  \ from anyone. From the greatness of his heart, he took us in, gave us a tour around\
  \ the town, fed us, served us traditional beverages from the jungle\u2026 \nAt dawn,\
  \ he invited us into his river. He owns the river, just underneath his house. That's\
  \ where they fish, bathe and travel. \nFew things are more gentle than a child\u2019\
  s smile. Wendy opened up and invited us to swim with her. This water mirrors the\
  \ sky so perfectly that you keep watching it in awe for hours. \nThis family has\
  \ nothing, absolutely nothing, and yet, they have everything. It is in those in\
  \ which material poorness resides that one can really find inner wealth, beauty\
  \ of soul. They say that in the jungle everything is to be shared. And that\u2019\
  s what this family does, with the brightest smile radiating from their faces.\n\
  \  Before going to sleep, on the wooden floor inside his humble cabin, Orlando gives\
  \ us a flower shower. He takes some agua florida in his hands, and puts it into\
  \ ours, and on our feet, chest, back and head, blowing some tobacco as well. This\
  \ is to drive away any harm, welcoming this new year."
