Text: "I had dreamt of traveling as a little girl. I was obsessed with movies set\
  \ in far off places, accents and the idea of somewhere new with an adventure. I\
  \ even had a map of Australia printed out at the library so I could put it in my\
  \ clear-faced binder in 4th grade. At the time I was living in a King\u2019s Highway\
  \ Motor home in Lake Berryessa, Napa County, California living at the R-Ranch. It\u2019\
  s a member\u2019s only place for owners to bring their trailers up for the summer\
  \ and stay in cabins. There\u2019s a huge pool where we spent every summer playing\
  \ sharks and minnows. A hiking spot called Cougar Rock where we\u2019d travel in\
  \ a pack knowing that we shouldn\u2019t be there because it\u2019s all in the name.\
  \ We were a family between the employees who lived there year round, the frequent\
  \ owners and the group of Ranch kids that everybody knew. We had acres to roam outside.I\
  \ spent time writing short stories on a type-writer and documenting my preteen-teenage\
  \ life in journals. I\u2019m an only child so I had a wild imagination. Writing\
  \ let me get my stories and characters out. Fast forward and I\u2019m in a maroon\
  \ Honda civic flying down highway five bound for Los Angeles. The biggest city I\u2019\
  ve ever lived in. I enrolled at Musicians Institute in Hollywood to take the Vocal\
  \ Program. When I got there I had this right fit feeling. The first few friends\
  \ I made were from Sweden, Italy and Canada. And here I was, this California girl,\
  \ exposed to all of these new cultures, words, foods, stories, and for the first\
  \ time in a long time: Family. Right there in my apartment on Fuller and Franklin\
  \ I had found it, it was home. It was family dinner at the table that I never had\
  \ in my house. It was stability knowing that we were all in the same life style\
  \ and big city. We all knew we were floating through a once in a lifetime. A whole\
  \ new chapter started for me in Los Angeles. I met a guy there who was a Canadian\
  \ guitarist from Calgary, Alberta. We had the freedom of endless time to roam around\
  \ Hollywood and fall in love. School ended, plane tickets were booked for friends\
  \ going home to Europe, and my panic meter set in. Am I going to lose home again?\
  \ Is family gone? Is everyone always going to leave? And again, I held on tight,\
  \ because I knew whole-heartedly that I would never get these days back. I guess\
  \ the last things I expected should have been all the things I should have seen\
  \ coming. There is so much more this box can't hold. My life has been a travel story.\
  \ I have lived my life as the Go Anywhere Girl."
