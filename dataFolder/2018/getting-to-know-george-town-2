Text: "After spending 10 days in Singapore and Kuala Lumpur, we reached the port town\
  \ of Butterworth. It was a huge relief to be out of the cities for once and visit\
  \ a small town. It was 6 AM and I was waiting at the ferry terminal along with my\
  \ wife Annie and daughter Simmy. The ferry was on time. People got on board the\
  \ two-tiered ferry and spread out. We sat in the central seating area. Far across\
  \ the strait, we could see the magnificent island of Penang. As the ferry started\
  \ to move Simmy got very excited. I took her to the bow of the ship. The calm and\
  \ serene ambiance with mild sounds of the parting waves seemed to set up the perfect\
  \ tune for a much-awaited vacation.\nWe exited the ferry terminal and decided to\
  \ walk to the hotel. As we approached Lebuh Chulia, the architecture of the houses\
  \ and shops started taking magnificent shapes and vivid colors. Georgetown was indeed\
  \ a reflection of the simplicity and gorgeousness of the local people and their\
  \ culture.\nAt the hotel room, we showered and slept for 2 hours. We got up at about\
  \ 9 AM, dressed up and left. Just outside, there were a few street food shops. On\
  \ one of the shops, there hung ducks, frogs, and chickens. We entered that shop\
  \ and ordered roasted duck and noodles. After breakfast, we got on the hop-on-hop-off\
  \ bus that took us around Penang. The most memorable and exhilarating place was\
  \ Penang Hill. We got to the hill-top in a small train. The view from the top of\
  \ the hill  was breath-taking.\nGeorgetown was famous for its street wall art. A\
  \ Lithuanian artist who had stayed in the town for months had gone around painting\
  \ the exterior walls of houses with a variety of subjects an placing props such\
  \ as a bicycle, etc. After lunch, we walked towards the Armenian street which was\
  \ famous for its \u201CLittle Children on a bicycle\u201D. We gazed at the mesmerizing\
  \ piece of art for several minutes. Later we took a photo and left.\nWe returned\
  \ at 7 PM. After taking a shower, we changed into casual wears, rested a bit and\
  \ left for dinner. We drowsily moved on to a nearby crossroad which had turned into\
  \ party junction in the evening. We sat at one of the open air caf\xE9s. A local\
  \ female singer was singing away classic songs like \u201CThose were the days\u201D\
  \ and the likes. We ordered beer, chicken and grilled vegies. The fresh breeze blowing\
  \ in from the Malacca Strait enriched with the mild tunes of the live songs \u2013\
  \ all our worries and all the fatigue seemed to melt away.\nNever had I ever thought\
  \ this experience would be so sublime."
