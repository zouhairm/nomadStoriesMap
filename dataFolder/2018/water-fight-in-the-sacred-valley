Text: "Diego takes us to the ruins for Carnival celebrations. He\u2019s sorted us\
  \ a lift in a friend\u2019s car. Usually you have to pay at a checkpoint but today\
  \ we speed past, peering back at the guards shouting through the exhaust fumes.\
  \ (\u2018Carnival day, no pay\u2019 Diego had assured us earlier).\n   We get dropped\
  \ off uphill at the entrance, on a wide dusty path framed by rocky cliffs. It\u2019\
  s crowded with local families unloading supplies - cool-boxes filled with beer and\
  \ ice-cream. All the kids are armed with water pistols and balloons and white silly\
  \ spray.\n   Below us lie the ruins, shelves carved into the grass like a giant\u2019\
  s staircase. People are setting up a huge marquee and gathering in clusters along\
  \ the ledges.\n   Diego leads us up steep steps, through dark tunnels and crumbled\
  \ huts. We reach the peak where we can see the whole of the Sacred Valley. Pisac,\
  \ the town where we\u2019re staying, sprinkled on the left, the deep gorge stretching\
  \ out towards Machu Pichu on the right. \n   The walk exhausts me. High altitude\
  \ and no food is not a good combination and I\u2019m ratty with it too, so we head\
  \ back in search of lunch. By the time we reach the ruins it\u2019s filled with\
  \ people. Crowds spread out like you\u2019d imagine an ancient coliseum. Instead\
  \ of a battleground, the focus is the view, the dramatic rise and dive of the mountains,\
  \ the glint of the river far below. We find a spot to sit and of course we get drenched,\
  \ splattered wet and covered in sticky spray. \n   \u2018What do you expect? You\u2019\
  re a gringo girl wearing a bright pink raincoat!' cackles Innes, as I get ambushed\
  \ by a group of teenage boys.\n   There\u2019s no food to be found so we settle\
  \ on lukewarm beer and a choc-ice.\n   We watch as women in woollen layers and traditional\
  \ felt hats perform a manic whirligig dance - a competition of who can keep spinning\
  \ the longest. Drums and flutes and high screechy singing, coming towards us with\
  \ the breeze. Kids creep in groups eyeing up and down for attackers and victims,\
  \ arms full of water balloons bought from passing vendors. Every so often, balloons\
  \ soar down like arrows shot, and someone will scream, and we all laugh - Diego\
  \ especially, he\u2019s suddenly a five year old boy, grabbing water balloons and\
  \ hurling them down, hooting with joy as they soak a group of his friends on the\
  \ next ledge. Until one comes crashing down on his shoulder and suddenly it\u2019\
  s not so funny. (Ha, ha.)\n   The day ends slow and lazy, with the sun setting on\
  \ the mountains, their spirits solid as rock."
