Text: "Saudi isn\u2019t just places with parched and desolate tract characteristic,\
  \ it is with characters that can call as adventurist, and even if Saudi Arabia is\
  \ a Muslim personage with a strict feature, dressed in to thobe and abaya that signify\
  \ conservative character, you\u2019re likely to fall in love with its sparkle natural\
  \ surface that is waiting to be discovered.  As an RND of profession, most of my\
  \ time spent researching for new food ideas and development , my exposure to Saudi\
  \ adventure comes only from the internet, so understanding Saudi\u2019s present\
  \ adventure is such like odd and very seldom activity. That is why every time there\
  \ is an opportunity to savor the real Saudi by means of adventure; I make sure this\
  \ will be very memorable one, just like when we decided to go to Ain Heet Cave for\
  \ an exploration with our new-found Local Saudi friends. \n\nTrekking: Our visit\
  \ to the Ain Heet Cave rock was on a hot summer season. Ain Heet cave is an underground\
  \ lake situated at the face of Mount Al Jubayl in Wadi As Sulay in a diminutive\
  \ rural community called Heet in Riyadh Saudi Arabia.The approach downward was very\
  \ precipitous, approximately 45 degrees inclined. During trekking, one thing comes\
  \ into my mind, that the struggle is real,it requires endurance but when I started\
  \ to manage to go through at the middle of the cave, it was worth all the struggles,\
  \ I couldn\u2019t resist to mesmerized to the rock formation for myself. Walking\
  \ through the rows of rocks, there was something I found peculiar. weird and wonderful\
  \ to think that it had emerged onto this landscape, considering it is Saudi Arabia.\
  \  \n\nSwimming : We decided to go on swimming at the bottom of the cave. Sadly,\
  \  it takes only half hour since dark fall very fast and we are afraid to get blinded\
  \ by the dark since no light or electricity in the area.\n\nPicnic with Locals:\
  \ After swimming, we prepared ourselves for an Arabic ultimate party and traditional\
  \ picnic offered by our local friends; we made our way towards the looming road\
  \ and parked up on the vacant lot. We prepare our foods, Filipino chicken Adobo,\
  \ Spaghetti and Shawaya chicken-an exquisite recipe made by our Saudi local friends\
  \ which cooked for almost 4 hours to get the perfect taste and authentic flavor\
  \ of the spices they used in the process, We stayed for 8 hours in the area, with\
  \ this, we did most of the interesting activities: dancing, card games, and silly\
  \ conversation and friendship matters."
