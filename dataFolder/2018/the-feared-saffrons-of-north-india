Text: "We\u2019ve been riding through the pale sand dunes of Jodhpur for several hours.\
  \ All had a tint of tiredness on their faces out of almost a week-long travel. Hadhil\
  \ got fed and throttled it hard until his Royal Enfield puffed out a chain of smoke\
  \ along with its thundering sound. For the next 50 kms we were racing to each other.\
  \ It was already dark when Salman hand-signalled to slow down. \u201DWe missed our\
  \ exit and we've to travel through an unknown route. Play safe\u201D He shouted\
  \ over the British machine\u2019s noise. The term \u2018safe\u2019 took us to the\
  \ words of a rider we met at Ajmer, where our ride started after a train journey\
  \ of 3000 kms away from home. \n\n\u201D let\u2019s meet if you make it back alive.\u2019\
  \u2019 He meant it. We were six heads with zero Hindi. South Indians, white and\
  \ first of all Muslims. \u201D No one is gonna catch English out there and most\
  \ of them doesn\u2019t even know where Kerala is and what language Malayalam is.\u2019\
  \u2019 he added. Then he lowered his voice and said, \u201D Watch out for the Saffrons.\
  \ Hindus out there aren\u2019t going to act easy on your names as us.\u201D We\u2019\
  ve been hearing the same since we left home. In a country like India, you are an\
  \ alien outside your state.\n\nWe continued smoothly until my bike's gear pad got\
  \ broken. Somehow we managed to drive it to a small town. The whole town was coloured\
  \ with the saffron flags of a local extremist group. We two went in search of food\
  \ and shelter while the others found a mechanic. We were very self-cautious out\
  \ of fear and always tried to stick together. We ended up finding food but no shelter.\
  \ When I returned a few people had bunched before the garage. Anxiety worked in\
  \ me. Then I saw Salman talking to them in a language which we would name \u2018\
  Hindi\u2019, but I don\u2019t think the North Indians will agree. Although they\
  \ understood nothing, all were seriously listening to his talk. He was explaining\
  \ them about our trip from Kerala to Rajasthan and about the beauty of their province.\
  \ They were responding like if they had never been to their nearest city, Jodhpur.\
  \ Unfortunately that\u2019s the truth. Our fear to the natives was gradually diminishing.\
  \ The garage owner even offered us a place to camp our tents and some Rajasthani\
  \ Magic Bhang. Too hospitable. \n\nNext morning our host took us to a temple where\
  \ offerings was made to a Royal Enfield Bike and we were welcomed like Indians did\
  \ Vasco de Gama. The hospitality we experienced afterwards just because of a bike\
  \ brand worth a write as the beauty of that land and the good vibes of its temples."
