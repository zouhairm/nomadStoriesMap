Text: "I never told her my name and she never told me hers. I should have asked. She\
  \ was a museum guard posted outside of Wilfredo Lam\u2019s \u201CEl Tercer Mundo\u201D\
  \ at the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes de La Habana.. She smiled and asked me where\
  \ I was from. I said the U.S.; blushing and hunching my shoulders. But she remained\
  \ open, standing up from her chair and approaching me to talk about the color and\
  \ vibrancy of contemporary Cuban art. She told me she loved working at the museum.\
  \ That she got to meet all sorts of people. That the painting she sat in front of\
  \ often brought people to tears. 'People see the tragedy in the world here, the\
  \ inequality.' 'It\u2019s really a sad painting and people can sit here for hours\
  \ looking at it.' She then took a beaded bracelet from her wrist and attempted to\
  \ clasp it around mine. 'A gift for you.' The fastener broke so she bit the metal\
  \ in order for the bracelet to close and remain on my wrist.  I wanted to give her\
  \ something back, I should have given her something back, but I didn\u2019t think\
  \ money was the appropriate thing (but maybe it was?). Instead, after we parted\
  \ ways, I thought about her warmth, about her energetic goodbye and bright smile.\
  \ I thought about how once she wrapped that bracelet around my wrist I began to\
  \ only think about our whole interaction as a story to tell later on. Wilfredo Lam\
  \ was inspired by Picasso and Picasso was \u201Cinspired\u201D by various African\
  \ artists. Inspiration is drawn and taken. In drawing inspiration, erasure is also\
  \ put into effect. Who gets to draw, who gets to take? Who is taken from? What is\
  \ erased? Inspiration can be made to seem like an airy substance, when, really,\
  \ its gritty earthy stuff, it\u2019s a pair of dirtied hands (of the \u201COut,\
  \ Out Damn Spot\u201D variety). Maybe, in order for there to be some kind of True\
  \ inspirational, cultural exchange there has to be a shaking of hands, a mutual\
  \ acknowledgment of a shared muckiness. Yet, there is a history of one set of hands\
  \ having a stronger, more manipulative grip. So what then?  Self-awareness of the\
  \ privileged artist and the shaking of hands with their muse isn\u2019t enough.\
  \ So what then? I\u2019m losing the story and myself here (a good thing?). I walked\
  \ out of the museum onto the cobbled street, down the road, by the water, to an\
  \ apartment, to a bed stand table. I unclasped the bracelet and placed it there.\
  \ Still, I thought about dark blues and greens. And bended bodies. And dirtied hands."
