Text: "As I lie on the beach soaking up some sun, there are a few observations I cannot\
  \ help but make. There are the observations that are foreign to me, including the\
  \ fresh ocean breeze as it whisps past my bikini\u2019d body and the steady rhythm\
  \ of the waves crashing down on the sand. I can smell the salty moisture mixed with\
  \ the unmistakable smell of sunscreen bringing back nostalgic childhood memories\
  \ of summer.\n\nThe second set of observations are something all too familiar to\
  \ me: the self-critiques and the insecurities. I pick myself apart looking at the\
  \ fat on my stomach that keeps me from being as skinny as the seemingly flawless\
  \ model two umbrellas down, the stretch marks on my outer thighs acting as arrows\
  \ pointing to the cellulite, the fine blonde hair that covers my entire body like\
  \ peach fuzz, highlighted in a way only extreme sunlight can achieve. What I never\
  \ could have imagined was I could go from a mode of constant self doubt to incredible\
  \ confidence in a matter of days. \n\nI was fortunate enough to befriend a gentleman\
  \ on my penultimate day in Mexico who adopted me into his group of friends. I found\
  \ myself at the edge of a secluded pool surrounded by a collection of varied strangers.\
  \ I spoke with people from all walks of life: a retired couple from Missouri who\
  \ had years of collective wisdom, a middle aged man from England who had worked\
  \ very hard to get where he is and understood the value of hard work, a young Canadian\
  \ couple who knew how to make the most of every moment, and a young entrepreneur\
  \ from Minnesota who spoke with me of how unique of a mind I have and how he has\
  \ not met another person like me. In conversing with these strangers, I learned\
  \ so much about myself. They brought into the spotlight traits I have always possessed,\
  \ but I was more inclined to believe as a result of the new sense of self-awareness\
  \ that comes with traveling to a foreign country alone.\n\nBy the end of the weekend,\
  \ I was able to see what they saw. I found myself with a confidence that must have\
  \ been buried deep under all the insecurities. I understand my self-worth. It was\
  \ always there; it just took this experience to empower me to see myself clearly.\
  \ My goal now is to empower other women to understand we have nothing to prove and\
  \ we live our best and most fulfilling lives when we are true to who we are. We\
  \ do not need to conform to other people\u2019s expectations. We can lay on a beach\
  \ in Mexico and not care what anyone thinks of us as long as we are happy with ourselves."
