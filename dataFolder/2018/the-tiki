Text: "\"Exploration is the physical expression of intellectual passion\" said the\
  \ English explorer Apsley Cherry-Garrard in his Memoir 'The Worst Journey in the\
  \ World'. I breath and live this quote and therefore, when I travel I do not miss\
  \ a single opportunity to explore and nothing can satisfy my curiosity. If you throw\
  \ me a thread of an opportunity be sure that I will grab it and pull myself up into\
  \ the adventure. \nWhen I traveled to New Zealand that was exactly what I have planned.\
  \ I seized every moment, I carpe diemed, and I even YOLOed. I do not only mean the\
  \ physical, tangible adventure like climbing a mountain or rafting down a waterfall.\
  \ I also mean the little, intellectual and intangible things, like talking to a\
  \ stranger. And often a stranger affects you in a way no mountain can. \nEnjoying\
  \ my freedom and the fresh air of Auckland\u2019s night-life, I grabbed a friend\
  \ to grab a drink or two. Enjoying each moment of the night we inhaled each conversation\
  \ as we moved from bar to pub and back to bar. We were talking to people from all\
  \ over the world, travelers and locals (known as Kiwis). But the most memorable\
  \ connection I made that night was with a M\u0101ori. In one of the bars there was\
  \ a big group of young M\u0101oris. They immediately invited us over to their table\
  \ and we spent the rest of the night with them. Together we went from bar to pub\
  \ to bar, showing us their favorite places.\nWith one of them, Neni, I had the deepest\
  \ conversation about nothing and everything, laughing and joking like sisters. We\
  \ were exchanging stories of our lives and the stories that happened before our\
  \ lifetimes. Neni was telling me about her ancestors and their beliefs and traditions.\
  \ She was wearing a necklace with a small men-like figure with a grimace and shell\
  \ eyes in bone carving. His name is Tiki, she said, he was created by the Gods.\
  \ He was the first man and his meaning, is deep knowledge and understanding, as\
  \ he brought it into the world. She explained me how their world was born, how the\
  \ earth and sky used to be one and were seperated to create life, light, and men.\
  \ \nTheir stories were fascinating me and all of us stayed and talked until dawn.\
  \ Nevertheless, the time came to say our farewells. We knew is was the last time\
  \ we se each other so, as I said my goodbye to Neni she handed me her necklace and\
  \ said I should have it, so I remember everything.\nI still wear the necklace and\
  \ I still remember everything. And when I see her again, I will give it back to\
  \ her because I believe you always meet twice."
