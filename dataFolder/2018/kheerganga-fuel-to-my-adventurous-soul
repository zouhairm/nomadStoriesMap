Text: "I and my five friends, who were strangers to each other, went on a 15 days\
  \ backpacking trip to North India last year on the month of July. We were done exploring\
  \ Jaipur and it was time to go to Himachal Pradesh. Himachal Pradesh, located in\
  \ western Himalayas, was the most exciting and the best part of our trip. It was\
  \ evening when we reached Barsheni. After travelling for 10 hours from Delhi, we\
  \ were quite tired so the first thing we did when we reached Barsheni was to find\
  \ a room and book it (although we were running behind the schedule). We found a\
  \ room for a cheap price but it wasn\u2019t clean. As we were settling in, we just\
  \ froze for a moment when we saw the beautiful Kheerganga from a distant through\
  \ the dingy windows of our room. And that\u2019s when we decided to trek the same\
  \ day in spite of the localite warning us against it.  We started this trek around\
  \ 5:30 pm with uncertainty as it was going to be a night trek. As we mounted up,\
  \ we came across bunch of people dancing in a small dhaba (local cafe). I hadn't\
  \ seen such chirpy and content people and seeing them helped our tired faces. There\
  \ were a lot of dhabas and open air cafes on way our way to summit. We reached the\
  \ peak around 10 O\u2019clock in the night, seeing those tents and cafes, was a\
  \ big relief. We rushed into the nearest hut cafe, to our astonishment they were\
  \ serving healthy Indian and Middle Eastern food for a reasonable price. Good music,\
  \ local drinks and tasty food, we definitely had a great sleep in those tiny huts.\n\
  \ \nThe next day, we got up to an amazing foggy view. We just stood there enjoying\
  \ it for couple of minutes after which we went to take a bath. I was completely\
  \ zoned out for a moment when I saw a hot spring. Taking a bath in a natural hot\
  \ spring at the summit was a thrilling experience, one more to tick off from my\
  \ bucket list. After this we started to climb down. Just when I thought this trek\
  \ couldn\u2019t get better, we were fortunate enough to see an unusual phenomenon,\
  \ rainbow at the ground level! \nThe view, mules and Maggie breaks from many dhabas\
  \ on our way back was just what we needed. I never thought what started as a deadly\
  \ trek would turn out be a wonderful experience that I\u2019ll never forget. Now\
  \ when I think of it, it wasn\u2019t the ticking time that pushed us to go for the\
  \ night trek. It was that awestruck moment in the dingy room where we caught the\
  \ first glimpse of Kheerganga that pushed us to do this. Sometimes a little push\
  \ is what we need to experience something great."
