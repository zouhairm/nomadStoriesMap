Text: "One year ago, I had a great job with one of the world's best companies, a tight-knit\
  \ community of friends, and lived in a top tourist destination. I had it all - money,\
  \ friends, hobbies - and I left it all. \n\nI left it all for a one-way ticket to\
  \ Colombia. Why?\n\nI wasn't unhappy. I wasn't going through a divorce. I wasn't\
  \ in the midst of a health crisis. \n\nI wasn't anything. And that was the problem.\
  \ I was in a rut. I wasn't learning or growing at the rate I desired and I felt\
  \ there had to be more to life than selling software and going on first dates that\
  \ went nowhere.\n\nLife is too short to not take risks.\n\nWith that mantra in mind,\
  \ I quit my job, sold all my worldly possessions, and bought a one-way ticket to\
  \ Latin America.\n\nAs a solo backpacker, I've had time to think, reflect, and discover\
  \ who I am. I've met my demons and been to hell and back with them. I've had incredibly\
  \ challenging relationships that left me crying on a lonely bus in the middle of\
  \ Ecuador. I've been hungry, cold, hot, sleep deprived, and bitten by bugs I didn't\
  \ even know existed. I've had intense bouts of homesickness where I fight the impulse\
  \ to simply buy a ticket home and leave all of this craziness behind.\n\nBut I've\
  \ also had the feeling of pure freedom skinny dipping in the ocean with sea lions\
  \ summersaulting around me. The feeling of butterflies when I encounter a road romance.\
  \ The feeling of satisfaction after having a full conversation in Spanish with a\
  \ local. The feeling of a full stomach and warm heart after sharing a meal with\
  \ my latest volunteer family. \n\nIn my 6 months of traveling in Latin America,\
  \ I've lived in a hut on a Colombian island without running water or electricity.\
  \ I've slept under the most brilliant display of stars I've ever seen in Volc\xE1\
  n Altar, Ecuador. I've wielded a machete in the jungle, with zero instruction or\
  \ supervision. I've come out of the closet, a lot, much to the dismay of the local\
  \ hombres. I've chased countless waterfalls and sunsets. I've been close to adopting\
  \ roughly 50 stray dogs and 5 cats. I\u2019ve formed lifetime bonds with fellow\
  \ travelers and locals alike.\n\nHowever, solo vagabonding is not all rainbows and\
  \ sunshine. It\u2019s challenged me, pushed me to the edge, and forced me to take\
  \ a cold, hard look inside myself. And that\u2019s exactly why I am here. To dig\
  \ deep inside myself, challenge my perceptions, and grow into the best version of\
  \ myself I can be. And that is something I encourage everyone out there to do.\n\
  \nTravel. Grow. Learn. Live."
