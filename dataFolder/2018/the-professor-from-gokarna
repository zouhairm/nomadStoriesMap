Text: "Hidden in some forgotten corners of Gokarna's market place was a dingy old\
  \ building, with cracks splattered across its yellow walls like the brainchild of\
  \ very artistic spider. But then I stepped into the building and breathed in that\
  \ intoxicating smell of paper and ink and magic and I was hooked.\nThe man behind\
  \ the counter, Mr Ragneesh, was a bespectacled jolly old man. White tufts of hair\
  \ were sparingly sprinkled across his head. He welcomed me inside with a smile and\
  \ waved me over to his collection of literature. Chatting while browsing through\
  \ the books, I got to know the back story of the humble bookstore owner.\nHaving\
  \ already outgrown the local teachers by the age of thirteen, Rajneesh was sent\
  \ to the University of Calcutta, where he finished his doctorate and went on to\
  \ become a professor. The only aspect of his life that remained constant all throughout\
  \ the years was his lust for reading, which caused him to horde scores of books\
  \ he had bought. Till one morning, a letter arrived from his home town, describing\
  \ the failing health of his father. He packed up his books in cases borrowed from\
  \ his students and left for his home town that very day, to take care of his family.\
  \ He knew that he would never come back and teach. Even if he wanted to, different\
  \ circumstances would find a way to tie him down to the place he was born, until\
  \ he died. So, he opened a small bookstore with the money he had saved and went\
  \ on surviving a mundane existence, living vicariously through the characters of\
  \ the books he so adored.\nI could not comprehend the extent of strength that must\
  \ be required to recount the story without an ounce of bitterness seeping into your\
  \ voice. Rajneesh did it masterfully, weaving a tale of wonder and merriment, pausing\
  \ in between to check if I was bored. For the next hour and a half, we just sat\
  \ around arguing and disemboweling metastasizing mind worms, till the wall clock\
  \ groaned out, cuing the curtains to one of the best conversations I\u2019ve ever\
  \ had. I picked up my purchases, thanked the man for an extraordinary evening and\
  \ then headed for the door. Taking one last look at the small store and its inhabitant,\
  \ I promised myself that I would be back there soon. After all, it wasn\u2019t regularly\
  \ that one found a kindred soul.\nAnd then, as I started trudging back, I thought\
  \ about the long journey to home, the eternal words of Robert Frost came floating\
  \ by, \u201CBut I have promises to keep, And miles to go before I sleep, And miles\
  \ to go before I sleep.\""
