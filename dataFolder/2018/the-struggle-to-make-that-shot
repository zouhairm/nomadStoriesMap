Text: It was spring of 2017 in Japan when I took a photo of a famous landmark of this
  country, the Churieto Pagoda in Yamanashi with the view of Mt. Fuji and the blooming
  cherry blossoms. "PATIENCE" ... there were tons of patience behind that photo not
  only from me but with my fellow photographers as well.. Last year i`ve pinned an
  image of that photo and made it to one of my travel goals to take my own shot of
  this famous landmark with blooming sakura. It was sunday when I came in the location
  to finally make that shot...I arrived there at 7am straight from a night shift work
  without sleep..it was a cloudy day and mt fuji can never be seen...i was able to
  find a good spot from the crowd of photographers and with them i`ve waited hoping
  the skies could clear up to show the mt fuji..at about 9am some skies cleared up
  and so i`ve waited a little bit more not moving to where i stand because I will
  be losing my spot if i leave...and there after 4hrs of standing and waiting the
  skies finally cleared up at almost 11am.. imagine standing on a bus ride traveling
  for 4hrs without leaving from your spot.. now i realized how some photos are of
  so much value not because of the image but how much effort you made to get that
  shot and the story behind every photos..
