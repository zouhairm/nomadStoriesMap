Text: "Deep in one of the colour bursting streets of La Candelaria, a homeless man\
  \ is dancing to Cumbia. Handing out warm gracious smiles so happily, my mind ponders\
  \ the meaning of happiness. \nMusic is playing through an old cassette player, nostalgic\
  \ feelings and memories appear. I buy him food, he smiles and says \"ch\xE8vre\"\
  . Salsa songs pour from a discoteca lined with drinkers. It's not yet dinner time.\n\
  \nThey say Paris is the city of romance, like many dreams, it bears little resemblance\
  \ with reality. Bogot\xE1ns however, partake in a different kind of ethos. One that\
  \ devalues the material and embraces the eccentric, creating an atmosphere of inspiration.\
  \ The result is a simpler form of romance grounded in happiness. It\u2019s one I'm\
  \ not familiar with but thrive in exploring. Naively I think I could do so in the\
  \ systematic way that I'm taught by western culture, but being from Istanbul, that\
  \ I love so much, tells me Bogot\xE1 needs to be felt with the heart.\n\nMy friend\
  \ Sandra tells me the city has been overshadowed by decades of civil conflict. As\
  \ all Colombians do, Sandra longed for truth to bring peace all her life; but that's\
  \ for another time she says while pouring Aguardiente into two glasses. This sadly\
  \ feels familiar to me. I push my nose into the glass, a sharp, clean, anise-flavoured\
  \ sweetness. \nThey say you can time travel with smells. I realize how much I've\
  \ neglected my sense of wonder while thriving for control. It's not shocking that\
  \ I live in my future, in my own fiction. \n\nI am influenced by everything and\
  \ everybody in Bogot\xE1. Its people live in accordance with the nature of things,\
  \ emptied of self and filled with compassion.\n\nFrom every corner of the city the\
  \ majestic Monserrate salutes you. Towering over 3000 meters once sanctuary to the\
  \ indigenous Muisca people, it\u2019s now a symbol of modern pilgrimage, guarding\
  \ Bogot\xE1. I find my constant here. \n\nThe trees, the sky, the mountains all\
  \ stand out with a presence that suggests consciousness beyond any ordinary assumption.\
  \ The humble glow from Plaza Bolivar, the epicentre of peace in Bogot\xE1, resembles\
  \ the luminous place in my fiction where all things rise and flourish. \n\nSomething\
  \ has shifted as I begin to feel my breath. \n\nMagic in Bogot\xE1 is so blended\
  \ with reality, it's beyond my imagination. Fiction that I brought with me climbs\
  \ up my throat as I exhale. The invitation is to feel with my heart and I am able;\
  \ willing. Something tells me, in pondering what happiness means, I'm just getting\
  \ started."
