Text: "With every step that I took in the direction of the summit of Ghorepani, the\
  \ fat-to-muscle ratio in my body staged a violent protest. I was exhausted. The\
  \ sun was on its way down and the steepest part of the trek was still to come. I\
  \ stood silently, leaning on my trekking pole, and waited till my laboured breathing\
  \ reached for an easier cadence. It was at this point, bereft of hope and the will\
  \ to go on, alone in an unknown, desolate terrain in an unknown country with no\
  \ contingency plan, my life was set to alter its course.\n\nA wrinkled, white-haired\
  \ man, at least thrice my age, was descending the very steep steps that I had been\
  \ dreading. He was returning from the summit that I had hoped to conquer. His face\
  \ was solemn yet amiable. He stopped beside me, one trekking pole resting in each\
  \ of his hands. Observing me for a moment or two, he whispered into my ears. 'Little\
  \ by little, love. The secret is to keep moving little by little.'\n\nHis words\
  \ stirred something inside of me and I smiled back at him, ear to ear. I trudged\
  \ on, powered by the wisdom in his words. I had been berating myself for not being\
  \ able to keep up with the likes of me, but two short sentences from a far more\
  \ experienced fellow traveller instituted a new belief in my system. \n\nGhorepani-Poon\
  \ Hill is a simply trek for many. I was not one of the many. Seven thousand natural\
  \ rock-cut steps were a test of my physical and psychological endurance. I learnt\
  \ that day that it does not matter how fast or slow you complete a journey but only\
  \ that you complete it in your own time. The life lessons gathered along the way\
  \ are of greater importance than competing against time to reach the end. The treks\
  \ that I have undertaken in Nepal have inculcated in me the clarity and confidence\
  \ to take on life's hits and misses as I remain fully cognisant of the triumphant\
  \ power of honesty and perseverance over fear."
