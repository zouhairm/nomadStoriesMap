Text: "The sight of a lake guarded by the mountains above the human settlements frozen\
  \ into fragments reflecting the nascent rays of morning sun has the knack to transport\
  \ you to a world befitting to be known as \u2018God\u2019s Own Place\u2019. Gurudongmar\
  \ Lake, located in the state of Sikkim of North East India at an altitude of 18000\
  \ ft has always been a milestone for travel enthusiasts. As widely said, the best\
  \ of the things comes with a little pain and so was reaching this godly place. Located\
  \ few miles behind the Sino-Indian International Border, the journey which is bound\
  \ to give you thrills also push you to the edge of human comfort and tolerance.\n\
  I, and my wife had decided to budget trip to one of the remotest place in India,\
  \ finally pinned this location. We started our Journey from Gangtok, Capital of\
  \ Sikkim and soon reached Lachen(a small town 50 miles short of Gurudongmar Lake)\
  \ in a shared cab. Our final journey started at 3.30 am the next morning and soon\
  \ we were told that we will be covering a distance of 70 kilometres in a span of\
  \ three hours gaining an altitude of around 10000 ft, entering an oxygen scarce\
  \ zone. Running alongside a half frozen river to witnessing the barren cold desert\
  \ beneath Kangchengyao Ranges, the spectacle we witnessed en-route left us awestruck\
  \ with the unfathomable beauty that the nature has to give us. Seeing many such\
  \ picturesque sights we finally reached Gurudongmar Lake.\nThe crystal clear water\
  \ of the lake was guarded by the mountains from all three sides with only one source\
  \ of entry/exit like a closely guarded castle. Witnessing a lake which is still\
  \ not frozen at the temperature of -10 degree Celsius reminded me of many mythical\
  \ folklore often told by the local folks left us perplexed by the phenomenon which\
  \ defied science. As I looked back, I could already see the tourists moving back\
  \ with many falling ill due to low oxygen level. \nI, and my wife just shared a\
  \ glance and sat on bench holding our hands lost in the tranquility and the serenity\
  \ of the place. I thought to myself that life might take us places, but it might\
  \ never bring us back this place which as told have been touched by Gods. With the\
  \ contented heart, we started our journey back looking at the never-ending skies\
  \ racing past the barren mountains thinking about what an American Sportscaster\
  \ Ernie Harwell once said, \u201C It\u2019s time to say goodbye, but I think goodbyes\
  \ are sad and I\u2019d much rather say Hello. Hello to a new adventure.\u201D"
