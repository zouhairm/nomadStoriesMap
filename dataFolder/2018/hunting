Text: "I met Wilson by the side of the road in Bario. The tiny village in Borneo,\
  \ accessible only by air, was a  tight-knit community where you didn\u2019t think\
  \ twice about jumping in a stranger\u2019s car. Bario sat squarely in a verdant\
  \ green valley that was eternally cloaked in a blanket of gentle mist. Wilson\u2019\
  s worn and mud-slicked 4WD was necessary for navigating the windy logging roads\
  \ that linked his hilltop home to the rest of the village. He invited my friend\
  \ and I to go hunting and we crushed ourselves onto a single seat. It could barely\
  \ contain us through the endless bumps and rolls of the mud-destroyed logging track.\n\
  \nComing from Australia, I\u2019d never actually seen a gun in person before, but\
  \ Wilson had been nothing but casual as he slung his hunting rifle over his shoulder\
  \ and led us into the forest. The trees were so closely packed that only fingertips\
  \ of sunlight could touch upon my face, and I wondered how we would see any animals\
  \ in the twisting labyrinth of foliage. \n\nBarking deer are naturally nervous creatures\
  \ and so you need to trick them if you want to get them close enough to shoot. This\
  \ is what Wilson explained to us as he threaded a long blade of grass between his\
  \ fingers and shaped it between his lips. The pressure of his breath on the leaf\
  \ emitted a shrill pitch that mimicked the call of the barking deer. We crouched,\
  \ concealed in the greenery, and waited in silence. I watched, horrified, as a leech\
  \ slithered inside my hiking boot. \n\nWe waited in silence for what seemed like\
  \ hours, until I heard the faint pressure of a deer\u2019s hooves on the soft dead\
  \ leaves that lined the forest floor. I was conscious of the rasp of my breath along\
  \ the inside of my throat. We watched as she picked her way slowly down the valley,\
  \ looking for her potential mate. Wilson turned to us and mimed covering his ears.\
  \ Before I could react, he took aim and shot the deer squarely in the shoulder.\n\
  \ \nShe let out a shrill scream and stumbled down the valley, with her hooves scrambling\
  \ desperately to gain purchase on the ground. Her eyes blazed with panic until,\
  \ finally, she came to a rest at the bottom of the valley, and they glazed over.\
  \ I felt a morbid curiosity gazing upon my first animal carcass, but Wilson was\
  \ nothing but business. He threaded jungle vine through her skin to fashion a backpack\
  \ and hauled her limp body over his shoulder. To a Westerner, this cool efficiency\
  \ was simultaneously shocking and exciting. To Wilson, it\u2019s just his way of\
  \ life."
