Text: "The dwarf stood a metre tall and wore a stern expression, but the twinkle in\
  \ his eye suggested he had a cheeky streak. His body was made from salt, but he\
  \ didn\u2019t appear snow white like I\u2019d expected - more stony grey. He watched\
  \ over the tourists that came to view his home: Wieliczka Salt Mine, Poland. I nicknamed\
  \ him Doc. To reach Doc I had to descend rickety steps which spiralled down until\
  \ I was 64 m below ground.  The last thing I expected was for the room to be large\
  \ and airy. \u201CYou can leave your canary at home\u201D, joked our jovial tour\
  \ guide Marc.  Despite subjecting us to one too many salt puns (\u201Cpeople say\
  \ I look like a dwarf, but I\u2019m not insalted\u201D), he provided an amusing\
  \ narration to our excursion.\n\nOur tour would show us only 1% of this amazing\
  \ underground city, a labyrinth of passages, lakes, chapels and sculptures carved\
  \ by the miners. \nThe miners recognised the perils of their career and placed their\
  \ lives in the hands of their Saints and built underground chapels. \u2018God Bless\u2019\
  \ was the standard greeting.\n\nSt. Kinga\u2019s chapel is the mine\u2019s trump\
  \ card. I stood in awe \u2013everything glistened in a kaleidoscope of sparkles\
  \ and the chandeliers above shone like illuminated Christmas trees. I could taste\
  \ the sodium chloride in the air. I ran my finger across the wall, it was smooth\
  \ and shiny. \n\nThe mine had been worked for a mind-boggling 900 years. Salt was\
  \ once the world\u2019s biggest commodity and was recognised as legal tender in\
  \ Poland. The mine is still a money maker (\u201Cso it is now a gold mine\u201D\
  ) and hosts some unusual events, such as hot air balloon flights and bungee jumping.\n\
  \nSeveral carvings of the Saints had now partly disintegrated due to exposure to\
  \ moisture (\u201Cyou could say they were being asalted\u201D). The last thing I\
  \ expected to see exquisitely carved into the wall was \u2018The Last Supper\u2019\
  . The thought of this slowly fading away brought a tear to my eye. I had the horrifying\
  \ thought that maybe it hadn\u2019t been a twinkle in Doc\u2019s eye, but a tear.\
  \ Marc put my mind at ease:  in 1978 the World Heritage Organisation placed the\
  \ mine on its endangered sites list. Scientists implemented a dehumidification system\
  \ that created safe conditions and subsequently the mine was removed from the list.\n\
  \nA cage elevator thrust me 135 m to the surface. I felt grateful to have experienced\
  \ this remarkable time capsule which was not what I had expected, yet relieved to\
  \ be back on terra firma! It was definitely a twinkle in Doc\u2019s eye. God Bless."
