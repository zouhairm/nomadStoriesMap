Text: "The gentle lapping of water, the creek of decks swaying overhead, whispering\
  \ breaths of sleeping neighbours, the still darkness.\n\nAnd there it was, the thing\
  \ I'd been warned about \u2013 the discomfort of a new journey. \n\nI'd thought\
  \ I wouldn't experience it, I was an explorer! I could do anything on my own! But\
  \ here I was, tossing and turning in a bunk, in a tiny cabin at sea level, slowly\
  \ being rocked by the navy ship gently carrying me to a far-off land. \n\nIt was\
  \ the excitement of my first solo adventure but it was masked by a cocktail of loneliness,\
  \ culture shock, a weak stomach's reaction to tap water and jet lag. So much jet\
  \ lag. \n\nOne dream I've had since I was a little girl, was to get so far out into\
  \ the ocean that I could walk around the boat, look out at the horizon from each\
  \ direction and not see land. To some, it's not the most exciting thing to put on\
  \ your bucket list, but if you don't grow up on the water, such a concept is bewildering.\
  \ \n\nThe moon was high now and shining through the circular brass windows as I\
  \ slid into my coat and crept out of my room. I navigated my way through the tiny\
  \ corridors, quietly scaling the steep ladders and crawling out onto the deck where\
  \ the gentle South Pacific air coldly bit my cheeks.\n\nThe fresh air and a moment\
  \ to myself relaxed me at first but the moon casting shadows on naval equipment\
  \ made me jump and as my heart was starting to pound, I heard a splash. I wasn't\
  \ alone. \n\nMy mind was reeling. Had I overheard a murder? Had someone fallen overboard?\
  \ Should I go investigate? \n\nThen another splash. \n\nAnd another.\n\nI finally\
  \ got the courage to slip over to where the commotion was coming from. \n\nWhen\
  \ I reached that ledge, I gasped and held my hand to my mouth. I'd never had a reaction\
  \ like this to seeing something beautiful, but here in the freezing Chilean waters,\
  \ I was dumbfounded, trying to figure out what my eyes were seeing. \n\nLong, glistening,\
  \ silver \u2013 swirling in the currents below, splashing and playing. I was witnessing\
  \ magic, I was certain I was seeing sirens playing in the darkness, calling to me,\
  \ not with their voices but with their grace.\n\nAs my eyes adjusted and my mind\
  \ caught up, I stayed and watched the school of flying fish as they played and danced\
  \ with the ripples from the boat in the bright moonlight until they circled and\
  \ swam into the black depths below. With them, they took that fear inside my chest,\
  \ I was ready to tackle the next day, when I'd arrive at Juan Fernandez Island."
