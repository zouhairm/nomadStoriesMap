Text: "I'd never been to Ireland. What I knew of Ireland was little more than Darby\
  \ O'Gill and the Little People. So when my old mate invited me to meet him in Glengariff,\
  \ County Cork, at his mother's home I jump on it. Europe seemed frightful, but Ireland?\
  \ I spoke the language sort of. And security, what better support base could one\
  \ ask for than a mom?\n\nHowever after a few days, felt my usual adventurous friend\
  \ was now jaded by how Ireland use to be before the euro and too caught up in his\
  \ family issues. So I set off on my own for my few days left to see a little more\
  \ of Ireland.\n\nFailing at hitchhiking I hopped on a transit which took me to Kilarney.\
  \ And in the morn I set forth on foot aimlessly. Where my feet took me was to the\
  \ back entrance of Kilarney National Park. By my feet I found something amazing.\
  \ No, not a leprechaun. \n\nClose to the ground a plaque read:\n             Fr.\
  \ John Crowley\n                 1891-1940\nBorn in High Street \"Padre of the Desert\"\
  \n         Ministered in \"Death Valley\" in\n    the Sierras Nevada Mountains\n\
  \             in Eastern California\n\nThe name I knew quite well. I caught my first\
  \ brown trout in Crowley Lake, a real fighter. Where I get groceries our town painted\
  \ a mural dedicated to his life. I often I rested at Crowley Point to watch F-16\
  \ fighters. Here once a dirt road to Death Valley in an accident his life ended.\
  \ Such serendipity could only mean luck shined upon me. I entered the wilds of Kilarney\
  \ Park. Today I might indeed stumble upon a Leprechaun.\n\nAlias, a wonderful walk.\
  \ Picked up a sack of litter looking under bushes, but leaving mildly disappointed.\
  \ And was beginning to rain. Where then on the middle of the walkway lied a soft\
  \ green rectangular pouch. On it, a picture of a little man, or at least his suit\
  \ assuming the man to be invisible. Did I catch a wee person off guard or did he\
  \ kindly leave me his raingear? I unfolded it and it fit me perfectly. I realized\
  \ I had now become an honorary Leprechaun.\n\nBack to town to cause some mischief.\
  \ My surprise, Euro Google taken over all of Killarney! In Irish tradition invaders\
  \ were here to blend in with locals for music, storytellers, food, cider and pints\
  \ of Guinness. And who am I newly minted Leprechaun not to join in all the fun?\
  \ I blended right in with their hospitality team wearing green jackets of their\
  \ own. Given a where to treasure map I'm not sure of all I did that night. I do\
  \ remember seconds of Guinness ice cream. And came home with a crock of Euro Google\
  \ swag."
