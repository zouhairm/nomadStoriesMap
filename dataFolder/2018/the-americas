Text: "One may believe different places are inherently different. Yes the food varies\
  \ and yes the cultures vary, but in reality we are all people expressing the same\
  \ desires of understanding and curiosity. I have had the opportunity of living in\
  \ North, Central and South America and I am happy to say that they are far more\
  \ similar than they are different. Recently I visited what people consider the most\
  \ machismo cultures in the world, Ecuador and Peru. I arrived in Quito on the sixth\
  \ of December, 2018. It was evening and there was a lot of commotion as people hurried\
  \ towards shouting taxi drivers. My traveling companion and I swiftly entered a\
  \ cab with an address for a couch surfer. We explored the city surrounded by volcanoes,\
  \ eating delicious foods and reading about the ancient religions, cultures, and\
  \ ecosystems in the national parks and churches. We headed North to meet Remi, a\
  \ Frenchman, who had taken on the grandeur task of building a permaculture education\
  \ center in a small impoverished area. Other US volunteers who were on the project\
  \ upheld a very typical idea of what it is to be \u201CAmerican. \u201D Raised in\
  \ a rural mountain community I have a very different understanding of what it is\
  \ to be \"American\", I found myself perturbed. Needless to say two weeks were spent\
  \ working on natural construction projects, traditional barique, cob houses and\
  \ an earth-ship construction, all the while deconstructing the norms of US culture.\
  \ Next we headed to a small fishing town called Mompiche, which had been severely\
  \ damaged by earthquakes the prior year. I found a new love and a new understanding\
  \ of the world through the Ocean and perceived poverty.\nI did not feel different\
  \ in this place of mostly dark faces for I had grown up with many latin friends.\
  \ When I was asked to volunteer or work I did not think that I was above doing such\
  \ things as cleaning toilets. I worked hard and efficiently, though a lot of anger\
  \ was directed at me. I also had men taking shovels right out of my hands which\
  \ I would later understand as a desire for the man to work for the woman. Most of\
  \ my free time was spent on a surfboard and making art and gardens out of debris.\n\
  The return the US was in fact harder than being abroad, for I now understood what\
  \ it meant to be cared for as a woman and to be desired for a mother. I had a whole\
  \ new understanding of Machismo and how the US functioned as a working society.\
  \ I understood what food sovereignty meant and how people can live just as happily\
  \ with less."
