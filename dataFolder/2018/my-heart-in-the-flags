Text: "An opportunity arose to find my passion in a world that has become fixated\
  \ on what we are on a screen, a version of ourselves to benefit no one but the pixels\
  \ it\u2019s betrayed on. Interaction via a click of a botton had become my every\
  \ day normality, then my mind shifted into a place of clarity, temples, culture\
  \ and the flags that were my beacons of hope every morning. \nI walked with a congregation\
  \ to give thanks for this life and the many surrounding as we climbed the mountain\
  \ to the peak and waited for her to cast her light across the valley, surrounded\
  \ by flags of prayer and the smell of incense. \nWaking the world of sleepers with\
  \ every disappearing shadow. \nThen my day would begin with a 2 hour bus ride to\
  \ a earthquaked region, to a small town and a school that would change my life forever.\
  \ \nShree Nandi Devi a small farming village would be where my volunteering life\
  \ would start. \nAt the time I would never had known the impact this village would\
  \ have on my life, on both sides of the spectrum. \nSuffering from depression and\
  \ anxiety for a very long part of my life the joy I felt then to see another human\
  \ being so happy for just being alive, made my existence seem smaller than the grains\
  \ of sand used to make the stairs that would provide safe passage for not only the\
  \ children, parents and teachers but to a group of men that showcased at the opening\
  \ ceremony once our time at the school was over. \nElders that sang songs that may\
  \ be lost due to the current climate in Nepal where education is a must for the\
  \ wellbeing of ones mind but a loss for a country, as most jobs are found abroad\
  \ in neighboring countries. \nOne man in particular Tula the principal would take\
  \ me under his wing to teach me a way of life I had been searching for with a slogan\
  \ I will never forget \n\u201CIf you are  happy I am happy\u201D \nThirty days went\
  \ by so fast but they were and still are the most memorable days I have had in my\
  \ life \nI got lost in a city that actually made me find the true version of myself.\
  \ \n\n\u201COne can only be the true version of oneself when they are surrounded\
  \ by there kindred spirits from the distant past\u201D NJC 2017\n\nNathan J Cooper"
