Text: "She was my constant companion in Iceland; reserved, but very direct. \n\nI\
  \ went to Iceland in June 2016, hoping to connect with a part of myself that had\
  \ been floating around, vanishing each time I caught a glimpse of it. I had recently\
  \ experienced a major life change and felt unsettled, lost, yet free. \n\nWhen renting\
  \ my SUV, the GPS navigator was unavailable, but I could wait for it. Feeling confident\
  \ in my Maps.me app and excited to get going, I said no and left. \n\nNothing really\
  \ prepares you for Iceland. I was in complete awe seeing the juxtaposition between\
  \ the vast and immense landscape and the tiny homes as they butted against giant\
  \ lush, green hills. It had a haunting quality and colors were more saturated against\
  \ the overcast sky. My mind was constantly processing what I saw and it was a full\
  \ sensory experience that felt electric. Lost in my thoughts, a female voice would\
  \ suddenly bring me back to reality as I drove, \u201Cin 100 feet, make a slight\
  \ left.\u201D \n\nAs I left Seljalandsfoss, the first major waterfall one sees from\
  \ the Ring Road, I looked down and saw my phone screen was a blue color. It wouldn\u2019\
  t shut off or restart. It did nothing. Instantly, I lost my camera, map, and communication\
  \ ability. I began to panic as reality set in, cursing myself for not bringing a\
  \ camera while a dull headache began to form. \n\nNormally, I go with the flow,\
  \ but THIS disrupted my flow. I took mental photos as I approached the Eyjafjallaj\xF6\
  kull Visitor Center. I was directed to the Sk\xF3gafoss Visitor Center, as they\
  \ would have internet access. A tech savvy employee at Sk\xF3gafoss fixed my phone\
  \ in a few minutes! I thanked her profusely. My headache melted away and I relaxed.\
  \ Standing in front of Sk\xF3gafoss, with its water pouring down and the thundering\
  \ sound releasing the tension I felt for the past 40 minutes, I felt embarrassed,\
  \ yet grateful. I was reminded of my privilege. Years ago, I wouldn\u2019t have\
  \ cared and my experience would\u2019ve been different. \n\n\u201CIn 50 feet, turn\
  \ right,\u201D she said as we left. Her\u2019s was the only voice I heard for long\
  \ periods of time for six days. I needed silence. Iceland shoved me out of my comfort\
  \ zone, and not only due to their bathing rules at hot springs. I sent myself a\
  \ postcard to remind myself of what this trip meant for me and what I accomplished:\
  \ I traveled abroad alone, went on a road trip, and camped once. I read it when\
  \ I need to. Did I connect with that part of myself while I was there? Not fully,\
  \ but I started to as I had new experiences."
