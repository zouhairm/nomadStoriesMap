Text: "Sticking out in our bright, skin-tight jerseys in yet another classic American\
  \ diner, I had become very accustomed to the inquisitive approach of locals.\n\n\
  \u201CThose your rides?\u201D would inevitably be asked, referring to our fully\
  \ packed road bikes resting unlocked out front.\n\nOverly friendly curiosity about\
  \ our journey followed by endless praise and astonishment; day 43 on the road and\
  \ I could diagram how this conversation would ensue. However, today in this bustling\
  \ Michigan diner, our neighboring breakfast companion remarked on how uniquely valuable\
  \ it must be to experience this country by cycling across its roads and towns.\n\
  \nStricken by his unusual observation, I looked up at this man ravenously eager\
  \ to hear more. It was September of 2016, deep into the long 2016 U.S. Presidential\
  \ election cycle, yet impossibly far from the shocking outcome and its resulting\
  \ societal upheaval. For the first time in far too long I found myself anxious to\
  \ just listen, instead of doing all the talking.\n\nHe was putting into words the\
  \ notions that I had been subconsciously experiencing over the past 6 weeks cycling\
  \ across 8 states from the Pacific Ocean in Washington and now in Michigan, our\
  \ last stop in the US before entering our peaceful, election-free neighbors to the\
  \ north in Ontario, Canada. Prior to embarking on this journey I worried about the\
  \ physical demands and wondered if my body would actual have the strength to complete\
  \ this feat.  Having called 3 major US cities home, lived on both coasts, and visited\
  \ nearly 30 states; I na\xEFvely assumed that I already knew this country. I did\
  \ not. My foolish preconceived notions of people that live in the middle of the\
  \ country were being challenged daily, and I was quickly realizing our similarities\
  \ rather than our differences. Our diner friend was right. Exploring the country\
  \ and talking to locals might make us more understanding and less divisive.\n\n\
  My bike became what I referred to as \u201CThe Great Equalizer.\u201D Had I engaged\
  \ with any of these individuals online, our politics, or religion more than likely\
  \ would have led us into a nasty fight. But here in person with my bike between\
  \ us, we easily engaged in conversation without judging one another or questioning\
  \ which candidate we might be voting for in 2 months.  We shared our favorite aspects\
  \ of their state while they offered tips on the best route to take toward our next\
  \ destination. Two polar opposite strangers, eagerly finding the humanity in one\
  \ another all thanks to a bicycle."
