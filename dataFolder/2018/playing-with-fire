Text: "Our second day on Koh Phi Phi was when we decided to join the parties on the\
  \ endless beach. My best friend, Carley, and I expected to be greeted by sun kissed\
  \ travelers, moonlight and the usual sand buckets full of alcohol.\n\nWhat we didn\u2019\
  t expect was to see fire dancers in front of almost all the beach bars. We watched\
  \ in awe as muscular, Thai men manipulated fire to dance through the dark sky. Repeatedly,\
  \ we would yell to each other over the thumping music, \u201CI can\u2019t believe\
  \ we\u2019re here!\u201D\n\nNext the fire dancers got a huge rope, lit it on fire\
  \ and started the most dangerous game of jump rope I've ever seen. They fascinated\
  \ us as they continued to leap above the flames. Not one of them got burnt and their\
  \ faces betrayed no signs of difficulty.\_\n\nThen they let party-goers join in\
  \ on the fun. Soon, drunk tourists started jumping the blazing rope with the dancers\
  \ like it was no big deal. I noticed that the dancers seemed to be purposely swinging\
  \ the rope faster if the travelers were doing well. This was not an activity that\
  \ I was going to partake in, no matter how drunk I got.\n\nYet, the fun didn\u2019\
  t stop there. As if the night wasn\u2019t exciting enough, the fire dancers started\
  \ a game of fiery limbo too. Being a drunk, and short, 5'3\" woman, I decided I\
  \ would give it a try. After all I barely had to bend when the limbo first started.\
  \ I did the limbo about three times before giving up as the flaming pole was getting\
  \ too low.\n\nSuddenly the fire dancers began carrying tourists under the lowest\
  \ settings of the blazing pole. They were bent at 90 degree angles from their knees\
  \ and carrying full grown men in their arms all while avoiding the flames.\n\nBefore\
  \ I could register what was happening a fire dancer pointed directly at me. The\
  \ next thing I knew he was carrying me under the warm glow of the limbo. I stared\
  \ up at the stars, felt the heat of the pole above me and tried to stay still.\n\
  \nWhile I was busy being carried by a strong Thai man, one of the fire dancers holding\
  \ the limbo pole decided to lower it right above us! The man holding me flinched\
  \ and tried to go lower, forcing my shin to bang into the fiery pole. He collapsed\
  \ under me and I scrambled through the sand to get away from the fire, laughing\
  \ due to my drunkenness.\n\nPlay with fire and you will get burned. Our parents\
  \ tell us this from a young age. Traveling is the exact same. Travel and you will\
  \ likely get sick or injured. However, if travel is what ignites a fire in you,\
  \ then getting burned should be no reason to stop."
