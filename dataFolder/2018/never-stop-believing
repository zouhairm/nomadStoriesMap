Text: "Rajasthan \u2018abode of the Kings\u2019, a state in northwest India narrating\
  \ the story of ancient magnificent palaces, rustic colourful houses, endless horizon\
  \ of Thar desert, quiet lakes, artistic and cultural traditions, heavenly delicacies\
  \ and vast wildlife reserves is phenomenal. In the month of March, when the Sun\
  \ was literally kissing the tigers in the famous Ranthambore National Park, situated\
  \ near Jaipur, capital of Rajasthan, I was sitting in a jeep, eagerly waiting for\
  \ a tigress knowns as \u2018Macchli\u2019 to arrive from the midst of dense trees.\
  \ This was my third time in this National Park and I had never seen her, people\
  \ from places visit this National Park especially for her, she was quite famous\
  \ in India and was celebrated with titles such as \u2018Queen mother of tigers\u2019\
  , \u2018Tigress Queen of Ranthambore\u2019 and \u2018Lady of lakes\u2019. And finally\
  \ she arrived.\nBold and fierce, powerful and supreme, she was an epitome of wildness.\
  \ The moment I saw her, I wanted to be like her, courageous, fearless, powerful,\
  \ strong and wild. She had sun on her head, trees with no leaves and a small lake\
  \ for water, for us it is nothing, may be many of us will not be able to even survive,\
  \ but for her, this was her Kingdom, a Kingdom where she was walking like a Queen\
  \ with core spark in her eyes showcasing that she can conquer the whole world. I\
  \ can never forget her, she taught me how to overcome obstacles in life with courage\
  \ and strength, no matter how much you have, you are a Queen, a Queen of your own\
  \ Kingdom, she taught me to be fearless in life and with this she went away, away\
  \ in the dense trees again from where she had come.\nSafari was over and so was\
  \ the day, her image was still in my mind, unable to forget her aura, I was walking\
  \ down the Ranthambore fort just next to the park. The weather was hot and I was\
  \ quite thirsty, , the fort was huge and the path was never ending. Tired, sweating\
  \ walking down the fort, I saw a smile, a smile worth million words, a smile that\
  \ was so contagious that made me smile too. There was a boy who was serving water\
  \ to the people in the fort, a boy with a smile of fortune. He introduced himself\
  \ and served water to me, he also told me that in the mornings he goes to school\
  \ and in the evenings he serves water to people in the fort. In this whole moment,\
  \ there was only one thing that was constant and that was his smile. My journey\
  \ started with wildness and ended with a smile and since then I never stopped believing."
