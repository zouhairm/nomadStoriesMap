Text: "This was a trip we made in late 2011 and beginning of 2012. \nThis was a very\
  \ surprising adventure and able to make me see Africa in a very different way I\
  \ was used to, even though I\u2019m from Angola and spent there most of my life.\n\
  One of the best things that Africa has (besides the people) is the vastness of its\
  \ lands. You can drive for hours and hours without seeing a human trace. That is\
  \ simultaneously very peacefully and unsettling. At a certain point, you start to\
  \ wonder if you\u2019ll ever see another person again.\nWe set off this trip with\
  \ some friends of ours, since it is never a good idea to travel great distances\
  \ without at least another car, just in case there\u2019s something wrong waiting\
  \ to happen to us or our car. This trip in particular was about 1.580 km We left\
  \ Luanda really early, at 5 a.m. and took the main road heading south. This road\
  \ (EN 100) took us to the next province, Bengo, where the landscape at this particular\
  \ time of the year will be green if there\u2019s a good raining season, or it will\
  \ be very yellowish, from the dirt and the dried plants. Even the baobabs become\
  \ very depressed if there\u2019s no rain in sight.\nWe managed to arrive to the\
  \ frontier in just 5 days after leaving Luanda, passing by Bengo, Kwanza-Sul, Benguela,\
  \ Hu\xEDla and Cunene without seeing all the wonderful beauties of these provinces\
  \ of Angola, but being able to enjoy much of this adventure (enjoying some beach\
  \ time, some visiting to mountains set-up and seeing a very busy frontier, mostly\
  \ for commerce purposes).\nNamibians proved to be wonderful people, very respectful\
  \ and welcoming to their tourists. I never expected such a welcoming attitude, as\
  \ I would never guess that I\u2019d be able to see the bluest of the skies in such\
  \ a green frame, as I saw at Kempinski Mokuti Etosha Lodge, where we could see wild\
  \ game eating in front of our bedrooms. We were so close to the wild life we could\
  \ hear them roaring from the distance (mostly lions). Right next to this heaven\
  \ on earth there\u2019s Etosha Park, a wild reserve where there are safaris prepared\
  \ to show the animals (zebras, giraffes, felines, elephants, gazelles, etc) in their\
  \ natural space.\nWhile there, we took the opportunity to visit Tsumeb, Grootfontein\
  \ (where lies the Hoba meteorite, the largest single piece of iron meteorite, weighting\
  \ more than 60 tonnes). We also visited some museums and local interest shops.\n\
  Visit this place and I\u2019m sure there will be a lot to surprise you there. You\u2019\
  ll thank the Universe for this heaven on earth."
