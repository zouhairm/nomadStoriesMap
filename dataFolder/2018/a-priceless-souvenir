Text: "As I exited the bus and looked around, a shimmering, golden-fused light hit\
  \ the high\u2019s and low\u2019s of the Grand Canyon. I\u2019d seen this view once\
  \ before three years ago, but I swear it seemed even more beautiful this time around.\
  \ \n\nI stumbled across an inviting seat of solitude close to the rocky edge and\
  \ plonked myself down, taking in the last light. It didn\u2019t take long before\
  \ I had the urge to move again and start photographing the captivating sunset. I\
  \ started snapping the depths of the landscape, the views made me wish I could transport\
  \ down there and look back up to where I was standing. I kept thinking about how\
  \ stupendous the world is, how we are so small in comparison to nature. I guess\
  \ wonders like the Grand Canyon will have you thinking like that.\n\nI kept shuffling\
  \ around the dusty path to capture a different view and suddenly I stopped when\
  \ a tree branched its way across my lens. \u2018Wow\u2019, I thought to myself.\
  \ As I looked through my camera, I realised the light was near perfect and the framing\
  \ was beyond flawless. I immediately fell in love with the image I snapped and had\
  \ this irresistible urge to show this couple that featured right in the middle of\
  \ it. I pleasantly approached them and explained I\u2019d taken a beautiful photo\
  \ and wanted give them a copy. Conversing through their broken Spanglish, they were\
  \ more than delighted to receive it and simply added their email into my phone.\
  \ \n\nWeeks later, I arrived back to reality and started processing my images. My\
  \ first priority was to send this email to Spain. Weeks passed after sending the\
  \ email and doubts wondered through my mind, had I written the correct email down,\
  \ was it lost in the centre of the inter-webs or was it simply sitting there, untouched\
  \ in their junk mail. I was so desperately hoping they\u2019d be able to feast their\
  \ eyes upon the photo of them that I fell in love with. \n\nI decided there was\
  \ nothing more to do but, wait. When several more weeks passed, the last thing I\
  \ expected was to receive a reply from this Spanish couple, but to my complete amazement,\
  \ my faith in the internet was restored and there, in my inbox, was an email from\
  \ Pablo. It wasn\u2019t just any old \u2018thank-you\u2019 reply, yet one that brought\
  \ tears to my eyes. There in my inbox was an email expressing that not only was\
  \ that photo the best souvenir they could have received from their trip to the USA,\
  \ but they'd sent me a picture, of my picture hanging as a canvas on their bedroom\
  \ wall in, Spain."
