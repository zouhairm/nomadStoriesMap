Text: "Our budget-crunched and time-constrained wanderlust souls were dying for a\
  \ getaway, and hence begun our Udupi diaries!\nWe booked our flight to Mangalore;\
  \ I expected a lot of pollution and concrete jungles for a city so rig and commercialized\
  \ like this. But gladly, my expectations were turned down by tiny, lush isles sprinkled\
  \ over the ocean, almost like sparkling emeralds thrown away in nonchalance. We\
  \ headed straight to Udupi that was a 2-hour drive from the airport. Just before\
  \ sunset, we reached the Beach House, a gorgeous 2 BHK, pitched rooftop house with\
  \ a pool in the front, ascended by a huge garden of coconut and banana trees that\
  \ opened a gigantic iron gate to the beautiful beach. The property rested on the\
  \ most secluded part of Malpe Beach, hosting hardly anyone beyond millions of radiant\
  \ crabs and shiny shells! Never in my life have I seen so many of them and so little\
  \ of us on the shore. Such an unscathed part of India with the most spectacular\
  \ sunset view; I realized why the road that\u2019s least frequented is the most\
  \ beautiful!\nThe next day, we headed to St. Mary\u2019s Island, a surreal, tiny\
  \ atoll just a short ferry-ride away from Malpe. Listed by the Geological Survey\
  \ of India, it features transparently turquoise waters, offbeat geological rock\
  \ formations and a shore that hosts more shells than sand! Huge, black crabs marked\
  \ their territory on the rocks, with waters washing off cute little starfish off\
  \ the shore; I just couldn\u2019t seem to have enough of this isle!\nOur next day\
  \ got an early kick-start; we set out to discover this unusual place where the river\
  \ met the sea, a land\u2019s end. Another of my first encounters in life, I walked\
  \ and walked in the waters, almost half a mile. Yes, it was that shallow! Now I\
  \ can say I walked on water!\nThe next few days passed away in a blur, with all\
  \ of us trying our luck at windsurfing and kayaking. Thanks to the owner of our\
  \ beach house, we had his personal Jet-ski at our disposal all day! I even rode\
  \ to St. Mary\u2019s to get some adrenaline! If you are keen on fish, Mangalore\
  \ serves the best in India, not to mention the mouth-watering Konkani cuisine served\
  \ to us by our house-keeper.\nOur 7 day vacay to the South was a true eye-opener\
  \ in a lot of ways. The mindset that a good vacation demands lots of money and a\
  \ foreign destination went down to drains with this most memorable trip of ours.\
  \ India is truly a treasure trove for wanderlusts; all you need is an eye to see\
  \ through!"
