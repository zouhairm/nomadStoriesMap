Text: "A spontaneous trip to Nepal revealed more than just breathtaking sceneries.\
  \ (tagline)\n\nIt was not looking good. The Global Financial Crisis was ruthless.\
  \ Jobs were being cut everywhere. I too fell victim to the crisis, losing my job\
  \ and any hope of finding another.\n\nAfter the initial despair, I found myself\
  \ booking a trip to Nepal, a group trekking tour of the Himalayas for 6 days. I\
  \ figured this would be the safest option given my fears of travelling alone.\n\n\
  When I reached Nepal, however, I found out I was the only one on the tour. I was\
  \ dumbfounded and in a panic.  All sorts of scenarios were running in my head -\
  \ could I trust the guide? Would I be comfortable with him? Safe? I finally decided\
  \ to take a leap of faith and go with it. This turned out be one of my best decisions.\n\
  \nNone of the \u2018worst case\u2019 scenarios eventuated. I was taken very good\
  \ care of. It was an amazing 6 days as we hiked through untouched forests, rivers,\
  \ mountains and saw the breathtaking Himalayas. We visited isolated villages where\
  \ I was blown away by the hospitality and humbleness of the locals. It was eye-opening\
  \ to learn how they lived on less than $2 a day, yet remained so content with life.\
  \ I visited an orphanage where the kids just seemed happy, despite having nothing.\
  \ Lessons to take back home.\n\nAs the tour ended, my guide suggested travelling\
  \ to Mustang after I expressed interest in Tibet. So the next leg of my journey\
  \ brought me to Mustang, one of the most remote regions in the world. I was absolutely\
  \ gob-smacked by this place. It had the most spectacular sceneries I had ever seen.\n\
  \nAs I walked the streets, I was captivated by the sounds of Buddhist monks chanting\
  \ in monasteries. The vibrations travelling to my core. There was something incredibly\
  \ peaceful about this place. It was quiet and unspoiled. Being the only tourist\
  \ there made it even more special. I will never forget riding a horse down this\
  \ valley overlooking hazy, surreal landscapes and feeling pure joy.\n\nLooking back\
  \ at my time in Nepal, I learnt some valuable life lessons and discovered things\
  \ about myself which is the last thing I expected. It turned out to be not just\
  \ a journey through the Himalayas but a journey of self discovery. I learnt to let\
  \ go, face my fears, trust myself and the process of life. I learnt to enjoy my\
  \ own company and discover what truly makes me feel alive which is getting off the\
  \ beaten path, experiencing the magnificence of nature and the unique ways of life\
  \ around the world."
