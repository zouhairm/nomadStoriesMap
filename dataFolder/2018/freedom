Text: "I used to travel a lot and this one changed my thought of how a usual person\
  \ should travel. This story is about my trip to Manali, India. Traveling was a fun\
  \ process for me and I used to take easy ways to travel and this trip also started\
  \ as the way I have charted. I used to travel in a minimum budget every time and\
  \ this one was the same. I live in Kerala, India and the trip was to the northern\
  \ most part. Me and my cousin took the flight from Kochi, Kerala to DelhI, the capital\
  \ of India. Everything was smooth until there. From Delhi we booked a bus from a\
  \ local agency and the trip started at evening 8pm on a day of may. The trip was\
  \ timed at 5 in the evening but due to some problems it started at 8 and we started\
  \ our journey. Since it was night I took a nap and then the thing which I saw when\
  \ I woke up was the bus in the middle of somewhere and it was breakdown. The driver\
  \ was missing in the bus and we both don\u2019t know the local language and rest\
  \ all the people don\u2019t know Malayalam which was our language. From there on\
  \ our actual trip started. Since our budget was limited we got to take a local van\
  \ from there and went to Chhattisgarh.  We met new people and from Chhattisgarh\
  \ we got a local bus to manali, but the best thing was, that was the moment I realized\
  \ I could survive any situation and sign languages are much better than any other\
  \ way of communication as we could say anything with that. On the first day alcohol\
  \ was the best remedy for our hunger at night and we could get a good sleep in that\
  \ cold weather too. that was the first time i have seen the snow fall in my life.\
  \ On  the second day we rented a bike and moved to every unknown places that we\
  \ could go. we planned our trip to Leh  which was dropped as the snow fall was too\
  \ heavy out there and there was no transportation. So we took the next bus to Shimla.\
  \ We got to try new food new culture and everything was new to us. The food was\
  \ limited, the money was limited and we got to stay in a tent and that came to be\
  \ one of the best part of my life. I got the courage to go anywhere in India with\
  \ that trip. I finally managed to speak Hindi which was the official language of\
  \ India as we both never thought of learning it since from our school days. Now\
  \ me and my cousin are both apart as I came for my studies in Poland, but that trip\
  \ was actually a life changer for me as it taught me how to thrive any situation.\
  \ the whole trip was not a planned one. I took up the decision while i was in the\
  \ bathroom."
