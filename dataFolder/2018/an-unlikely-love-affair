Text: "Luggage in tow, we hobbled outside the sweltering Tribhuvan airport. A retired\
  \ ambulance played taxi for the night, shuttling us through a maze of urban chaos\
  \ and into the heart of Thamel \u2013 Kathmandu's tourist hot-spot. The early hours\
  \ of Saturday morning saw many a manual labourer and partygoer alike flood the streets\
  \ of Thamel's red-light district, feral dogs and tangled, low-hanging cable wires\
  \ stridently confronting. Frenzied intersections were sentineled by local law enforcement,\
  \ guns over shoulder, in an effort to keep contumacious youths in line.  \nA different\
  \ scene altogether was Thamel in daylight. Culture shock was replaced with a mordant\
  \ urge to explore and a slight caginess. Our substandard map-reading skills drove\
  \ us up and down the dust and tourist-riddled Marg to the point of a welcomed familiarity\
  \ with the area. Street vendors advertised meretricious souvenirs, bartering with\
  \ parsimonious tourists as the scent of smoke from burning incense beckoned us into\
  \ local shops - a redolent, though undoubtedly carcinogenic, oxygen replacement.\
  \  \nDhulikhel was our next stop on our travels - a 90-minute van ride from Thamel\
  \ through multiple towns, having us witness the varying degrees of execrable poverty.\
  \ Abandoned, dilapidated buildings fringed the carriageway and banks were piled\
  \ high with refuse, wild dogs gallivanting around a paradise of discarded animal\
  \ offcuts.  \nThe town was small and easily navigated. Pop-up shops bordered the\
  \ bitumen, selling packaged snacks and bananas in surplus. Vans and motorcycles\
  \ monopolised the high street, an orchestra of blaring horns, interrupted occasionally\
  \ by the deafening music of communist ralliers as they hurtled down the roads in\
  \ their camouflage-painted trucks. \nOur accommodation was somewhat quaint and cloistered,\
  \ but with single toilet - host to an acrid smell one could very nearly taste. My\
  \ bedside view however, was something else. As the sun rose, it would unveil a backdrop\
  \ of deceptively tall Himalayan mountains standing in stark relief against the valley\
  \ which they lined in a serpentine formation. \nI still don't quite know what about\
  \ Nepal had me fall in love with the place. Perhaps it was the majestic landscapes\
  \ Dickens would have had a hard time describing, or the lack of homely comforts\
  \ making each day feel like an adventure, teaching me that the only thing like home\
  \ is the absence thereof. Either way, to fall in love with a place so foreign to\
  \ home as Nepal was the last thing I expected."
