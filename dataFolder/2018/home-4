Text: "\u201CWhere are you going?\u201D Glazed eyes and immobilized body, only two\
  \ pennies shy of a nickel in numbers; I was barely breathing. \u201CSomewhere quiet\u201D\
  \ she whispered, as her body undulated listening to things shatter. Contemplating\
  \ what my mother would look like when he was finished, I closed the shutters and\
  \ I flew. Wandering through the silent walls of Dhamma Giri, I have arrived. To\
  \ see the things as they are, flesh and fresh wounds for centuries. Spirals of gold\
  \ frame her face with hope diamond lenses; an as she blinks the kaleidoscope is\
  \ born. For the ones isolating themselves to reach day 10, you never needed to leave.\
  \ \n Her aura barely lite and the paper skin that laid upon her broken bones are\
  \ the only reason for the structure you see, but this is my provider or so it seemed\
  \ to be. Thread like arms I tried to cradle her even if it should have been me;\
  \ a gypsy she gave birth too she realized she was finally set free. For years she\
  \ would visit the sea of trees clunching the moss as it dyed her hands this lifelessness\
  \ around her was apart of her painless plan. Culturally not sown to fit I couldn\u2019\
  t grow in Japan, so in two thousand and five she let go of my hand. Where my kindered\
  \ spirt was laid to rest there in the vines where the irony of green was black with\
  \ tear stained eyes. Alone on this globe as if no one could hear me weap, the day\
  \ life as I knew it was swept under my feet. Ole Christopher Columbus by my side\
  \ we searched the world far and wide settling back to America at this time, the\
  \ land of the free; a dream of mine. Where visions can\u2019t be seen while scribbling\
  \ with a camouflaged pen I sank into a Qattara Depression, and my 133 meter excursion\
  \ began. Sliding in and out of consciousness I griped the gravel beneath me, and\
  \ I knew I couldn\u2019t quit. Like how out on the plains of Thingvellir the sky\
  \ became bright, and I danced naked under the northern lights. So with this body\
  \ as my offering to do as you wish, I crumbled up my fears placing them at The Wailing\
  \ Wall; it\u2019s yours. These feet will find their way as lecturers stay behind,\
  \ because knowledge not built in a classroom you shall learn through time.\n Dreams\
  \ are reality if you live there long enough. Though I haven\u2019t been everywhere\
  \ yet whether I touch it physically or the pictures just play in my mind, this soul\
  \ within me I\u2019ve got is mine. And as far as our senses are concerned some people\
  \ just feel like home. So depending on life, I could be in Argentina by tomorrow."
