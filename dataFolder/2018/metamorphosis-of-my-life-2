Text: "Just when I thought the greatest obstacle in my life was over, the 16-year\
  \ old me couldn\u2019t have been any more wrong. Life was just getting started.\
  \ It was not the beginning of the end but the end of the beginning. I was yet to\
  \ meet greater hurdles in the days to come.\n\nIt started off with saying farewell\
  \ to my folks and to my motherland.  While boarding, I turned around to share last\
  \ few glimpses before I was gone for a year. I intended to talk and have it done\
  \ casually. I wanted to say something, anything but no words would roll down my\
  \ tongue. Before I knew it, the tears that I had been fighting to keep it in fell\
  \ down my cheek and profusely onto my Ama's shoulder as we shared the last hug,\
  \ knowing that it will be a while before we can all reunite back as a family.\n\n\
  The train started chugging slowly to Delhi; the place where I would be breathing\
  \ for the next three years.\n\nInitially, I felt like an egg left at its own mercy.\
  \ Never had I felt so lost like the time when I first arrived at the college. I\
  \ vividly remember begging Ama to allow me to come home. The words she then said\
  \ had such a profound effect on me that from there on, by God's grace, life started\
  \ to get better. \n\nOne crack\u2026Two cracks\u2026several cracks. The egg then\
  \ hatches and out comes the tiny caterpillar.\n\nBeing born in Bhutan, a country\
  \ known by the lucky few, I became the epitome of popularity in the class. As I\
  \ write this semi-biography, I can still recall people coming up and enquiring about\
  \ the \u2018foreign country,\u2019 getting fascinated by the lengths of even asking\
  \ for photographs. And I did enjoy the spotlight that was given although it didn\u2019\
  t last long. Shortly after, that sheer popularity was gone.\n\nFor once, it was\
  \ like I had all the time in the world and so little to do. I was rich with seconds,\
  \ minute and hours but I was foolish then to know its real value. However, reality\
  \ dawned on me. A person who initially felt that days were longer than years suddenly\
  \ felt that time slipping by her fingers quietly. I was now in a race against time.\
  \ I had a lot to accomplish but possessed so little time.\n\nNothing was easy. But\
  \ nobody told me it was going to be easy either. I could see changes in myself and\
  \ I now yearn for the final stage. I want to come out of my pupa and fly off so\
  \ that the world can admire me for at least this one time.\n\nSo this is my little\
  \ metamorphosis of my life, an unexpected but definitely a remarkable journey of\
  \ a young girl; out on her lonely venture in an alien world."
