Text: "There were only a few days memorized last forever in my Life. \n\nAnd one of\
  \ those days was that summer day.. \n\nI just arrived in Kyrgyzstan, and I was looking\
  \ for a good place for lunch. I met that girl at the bus stop; she gave me some\
  \ advice on where to eat and the lake, which is exactly to be visited in Kyrgyzstan.\
  \ And there was the something that has changed my mind last forever, and pushed\
  \ me to the edge \u2013 it was the riskiest trip, I have ever had!\n\nI will describe\
  \ the dangerous and advantageous way to the lake a bit later, in my next story \u2013\
  \ because of it worth a thousand words describing those incredible beauties and\
  \ unexpected discoveries on the way!\n\nAs for now, I will tell you about the place,\
  \ which itself helped me change my mind, and helped to better understand the World.\n\
  \ \nWell, K\xF6l-Kogur Lake is beautiful, but underestimated masterpiece of nature.\
  \ \n\nIt is located in the northern Tien-Shan and is surrounded by picturesque mountain\
  \ landscape, wooded terrain, and abrupt slopes.. \n\nAll these make you feel like\
  \ a grain of sand, before the background of something immense, which inevitably\
  \ will make you breath deeper, concentrating on the emotions, overfilling you from\
  \ within. \n\nAt one moment you will be eager to SCREAM, as loud as you can! This\
  \ will be your declaration of love to the beauty, which is seen by you at this moment\
  \ of your life, the beauty, which will not come with you, just like if it was a\
  \ beautiful girl, whom you can try to conquer \u2013 it is a different beauty, which\
  \ is only to be remained in your heart, and partly on your photos - this beauty\
  \ will never be yours! You won\u2019t be able to see it every day cooking you some\
  \ food for the breakfast up to the rest of your life, this is different beauty,\
  \ you will never conquer!\n\nAnd now you feel the seriousness of the moment, and\
  \ how priceless this beauty is for you, screaming at the top of your voice!\n\n\n\
  After I returned back from K\xF6l-Kogur Lake, I abandoned my former work in the\
  \ office and became an artist."
