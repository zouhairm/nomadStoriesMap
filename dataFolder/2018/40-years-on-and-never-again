Text: "I knew I'd said something wrong as soon as the words came out of my mouth.\n\
  \n\u201CWhere are you from?\u201D I asked, as I climbed into a cab in my hometown\
  \ of Auckland, New Zealand.\n\n\u201CCambodia,\u201D he replied.\n\n\u201COh nice,\
  \ we studied Cambodia in school \u2013 Pol Pot and all that.\u201D\n \nHis silence\
  \ spoke volumes. It wasn\u2019t until almost a decade later, I learned what \u201C\
  all that\u201D really entailed. It has to be seen to be believed \u2013 and it has\
  \ to be believed to be remembered. \n\n--\n\nIn Cambodia, just south of the country\u2019\
  s capital Phnom Penh, there is a tree that was used to kill thousands of children.\n\
  \nThe Chankiri tree, an inconspicuous cottonwood, is one of many that stands in\
  \ the former orchard of Choeung Ek. It\u2019s also the place where 2,000 children\
  \ breathed their last breath. Choeung Ek is now the most infamous of the Killing\
  \ Fields, where the Khmer Rouge regime executed over 1 million people in the space\
  \ of just 4 years during the Cambodian Genocide.\n\nThe day I visited was like any\
  \ other in Cambodia. The air was thick with heat, permeated with alternating smells\
  \ of rubbish and street food as my tuk-tuk driver Chann sped over side streets towards\
  \ the tourist attraction. He warned me it was going to be a hard day but as we pulled\
  \ up to the site, it was strangely peaceful. There was the sound of chimes hanging\
  \ in the air, and muted conversations coming from the smattering of tourists milling\
  \ around. \n\nThe grounds have not been changed since the site was closed in 1979.\
  \ Every couple of steps there is a sign that shows the magnitude of what you\u2019\
  re looking at: \u201C1,300 bodies were found in this grave. Some remain\u201D. When\
  \ it rains, parts of skull and bone fragments are unearthed from the mass graves.\
  \ Hanging on the Chankiri tree are hundreds of bracelets and travellers\u2019 souvenirs.\
  \ There\u2019s nothing gory, nothing sensational, nothing at all to see but a simple\
  \ sign that reads: \u201CKilling tree against which executioners beat children\u201D\
  .\n\nNext year marks just 40 years since the Cambodian genocide ended. It was the\
  \ worst time in Cambodian history \u2013 and most adults in Cambodia today either\
  \ can remember it, or are related to someone who can. \n\nWalking back to the tuk-tuk,\
  \ I caught sight of Chann\u2019s face. He gave me a small smile but his silence\
  \ said it all. It has to be remembered so that it never happens again."
