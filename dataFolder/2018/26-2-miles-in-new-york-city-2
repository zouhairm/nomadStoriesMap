Text: "We had come from all over the world, yet we were all running on the same path,\
  \ the same journey together. Reading those hilarious-witty signs, listening to the\
  \ roaring cheers, and high-fiving kids. The church choirs, the bar drinkers, the\
  \ families, and high school bands. Orthodox Jews, the Step team of Harlem, hipsters\
  \ from Brooklyn, the Manhattan chic; they all showed up. I was seeing New York City\
  \ for the first time, and I was falling in love with it. \n\nThis was my first marathon.\
  \ I hoped to internalize that ordinary people could do extraordinary things. \n\n\
  There was a blessing of runners at St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral, pasta deals, and signs\
  \ of good luck on 5th Avenue. I wandered the electrified city in complete wonder\
  \ inhaling pre-race carbohydrates-including a mouth-watering bagel from a less-than-pleasant\
  \ deli man. The next day, I arrived to the race start at 6:00 AM where other runners\
  \ shared warm blankets and food as we laughed at our anxiety and tried to calm each\
  \ other\u2019s fears. \n\nAnd then, the race began. They played Sinatra\u2019s \u201C\
  New York, New York\u201D, and the runners let out an animalistic cheer. The day\
  \ we had trained months for had finally arrived. I ran in that drizzling, glorious\
  \ rain for over almost five hours. Here\u2019s the catch I wasn\u2019t expecting-\
  \ I was having an absolute blast. \n\nStarting in Staten Island, I witnessed the\
  \ most breathtaking views of Lady Liberty as I crossed the Verrazano Bridge. The\
  \ runners were shortly after greeted by construction workers with coffee as we made\
  \ our way to Brooklyn. Running past red brick apartments with parties on front porches\
  \ left many of us dancing in the street.  In Queens, the diverse culture welcomed\
  \ us with their music and flavors. In the Bronx, we felt the gritty, edgy pulse\
  \ pushing us through. In Manhattan we ran past high-rise apartments and awed at\
  \ the scenery we\u2019d only seen in movies. There was a man running the entire\
  \ 26.2 miles with one leg, a woman who had survived cancer three times, and a blind\
  \ runner. There were Spaniards dancing, new friends from South Africa cheering,\
  \ and Germans in matching shirts. People of all ages, nationalities, and fitness\
  \ levels; a microcosm of the world on one road. \n\nWith each step, we lost ourselves\
  \ and let go of the past. When I turned the corner to enter Central Park and crossed\
  \ that finish line, the tears started to fall. The day was full of joy & suffering,\
  \ intense pain & intense happiness. It was the greatest metaphor for life in the\
  \ greatest city in the world."
