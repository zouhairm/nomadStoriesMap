Text: "More than a decade ago, an opportunity landed on my hand. A certain college\
  \ in London tied up with the travel agency in Manila to recruit people to study\
  \ and work in England at the same time. Determine to change my life, a decision\
  \ has been made that pushed me to the edge of moving to England and try my luck\
  \ there.\nAs years go by, my dreams are becoming in reality, I started fulfilling\
  \ one of my dreams travelling the whole world. My first travel adventure was I in\
  \ Switzerland one wintry weekend. I was so amazed how beautiful the country is.\
  \ Since then, I perpetually am travelling as much as I can. I did a month of volunteering\
  \ in Fiji\u2013\u2013teaching English for a two week in the school of special children,\
  \ and another two in a marine conservation looking after turtles. Whilst there,\
  \ I embarked marvellous experiences of skydiving from 10,000 feet in the air; learning\
  \ scuba diving, surfing, and exploring another island to experience the International\
  \ date line where one day is on the east side of the line and the following day\
  \ is on the west side. Hence, I attended a two-week summer programme in China about\
  \ the Global Academy of Liberal Arts (GALA) at the Communication University of China\
  \ in relation to Global Citizenship. In those two weeks, I observed the positive\
  \ and negative sides of China. \nI really enjoy travelling, taking astonishing memorabilia\
  \ and engaging more diverse cultures in this world. So far, I\u2019ve travelled\
  \ either alone or with friends but 90% of my travel exploration, I did my travel\
  \ alone and met some new friends along the way to all the 50 countries in Europe,\
  \ and two transcontinental countries such as Russia and Turkey; six states in America,\
  \ two provinces in Canada whilst in Asia, I already have unforgettable memories\
  \ in Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Macau, China, Mongolia and\
  \ the Philippines; Fiji, Australia and New Zealand have taught me more to appreciate\
  \ about the mother nature and our environment in general.\nThose experiences I have\
  \ collected through the years reflected on who I am now. Every day is a new lesson\
  \ to learn. Every challenge and obstacles have pushed me to the edge of knowing\
  \ myself beyond my core. I love stretching to the maximum limits both of my physical\
  \ endurance and mental stamina. I am not superman and not perfect either, but I\
  \ was born a competitor, but I have learned the most difficult competition I have\
  \ encountered is not a competition with others, but within myself.  The edge is\
  \ in my hands."
