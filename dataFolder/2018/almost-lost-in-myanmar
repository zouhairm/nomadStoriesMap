Text: "It was midnight when I got down from my bus at \u201C115 Miles\u201D, a rest\
  \ stop on the Yangon-Mandalay expressway. The place was alive with activity as if\
  \ those were early hours of the evening. There were people everywhere, eating, drinking,\
  \ talking and laughing.\n\nWe were on our way to Mandalay from Yangon. This was\
  \ our first stop and I had to get off the bus for my usual loo routine. Neither\
  \ the crowd nor the noise seemed to engage me at that point of time because my mind\
  \ was fixated on a water closet and an urgent need to relieve myself. I rushed out\
  \ without a second thought and unfortunately, without my cellphone.\n\nMy sense\
  \ of direction is generally awful so I devised a simple plan to get to the toilet.\
  \ I would follow a fellow Burmese passenger (\u201Cmy Lady\u201D), use a toilet\
  \ close to hers and follow her back again. I spotted my Lady as soon as I got off\
  \ the bus and stayed close by. I thought my plan was rock-solid until I realized\
  \ that it wasn\u2019t, especially in a new country among new people.\n\nThe toilets\
  \ were nestled deep behind the kitchens of Feel Express, a ubiquitous convenience\
  \ store in Myanmar. As we got closer to the toilets, the crowd started getting thicker\
  \ and noisier. There was some jostling around and in the blink of an eye, I lost\
  \ sight of my Lady. There were hundreds of women in front of me and suddenly, I\
  \ had no clue who I was following! I was afflicted by a common condition called\
  \ the Other-Race Effect and it had severely impacted my ability to distinguish between\
  \ Burmese faces. Everyone looked alike!\n\nIn a desperate attempt to find my way\
  \ back, I tried to locate a trash can that I had passed by on my way to the toilet.\
  \ I found six identical ones and beyond each, stood hundreds of similar-looking\
  \ buses. Tears started welling up inside me. I had no money, no phone and no Burmese\
  \ language abilities. I was, clearly, lost.\n\nI sat on a rock nearby and saw a\
  \ bus move out of the parking lot. Through the clearing, bright yellow shone at\
  \ me from a distance, probably just another bus. \"Wait, was my bus yellow in color?\
  \ Most likely, it was!\" I ran towards the yellow with all hope and strength. My\
  \ husband was waiting right in front of it and I collapsed into his arms!\n\nWe\
  \ drove away from 115 but I had a lot to think over. Only now did I realize the\
  \ importance of spending time with people. If it could take me days to recognize\
  \ faces, how could I even hope to comprehend their lives in a few weeks? \u201C\
  Understanding\u201D, surely, was the journey of a lifetime!"
