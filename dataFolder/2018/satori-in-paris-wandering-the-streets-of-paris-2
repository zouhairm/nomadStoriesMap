Text: "Victor Hugo said \u2018To err is human, to loaf is Parisian\u2019. Chasing\
  \ time had turned me into a stranger - I had to escape from myself. Call it self-exile\
  \ if you like.\nI left for Paris - with no plans, no agenda and importantly - alone.\
  \ I decide to hit the streets as a fl\xE2neur \u2013 wander aimlessly \u2013 guided\
  \ only by serendipity. \nAs I saunter down to the Seine, I feel light as a bird\
  \ in spring. An ethereal light washes over the arcs of the stone bridge \u2013 making\
  \ even gargoyles look angelic. The soft murmur of the river hums like a heart in\
  \ love. \nI hear the melancholy of the lost Jazz Age in the tune of a flute player.\
  \ The grey mansard roofs, like lofty spirits, reach out to the sky. Wannabe p\xE9\
  tanque players, map-toting tourists, faux love locks \u2013 all obliterated in my\
  \ quest for je ne sais quoi.\nI cross the bridge onto Ile St Louis which still bears\
  \ the iron moorings of the original Parisii tribe.  My hand glides through the thick\
  \ iron ring and when I touch the rough stone - it plunges me into its petrified\
  \ history. The whole island looks like the hull of an ancient ship. I stand on the\
  \ triangular tip, feeling the wind exonerate every care, like the Winged Victory\
  \ in the Louvre.  \nI find a seat at an outdoor table, with a glass of kir, relieved\
  \ that I don\u2019t have to do anything or be anywhere. I strike up a conversation,\
  \ in broken French to the woman next to me, who is an opera singer. Her 90 year\
  \ old mother is dressed in turquoise, flashy earrings and full make-up. \n\u2018\
  I brought my mother here to cheer her up,\u2019 she explains. \u2018She lost her\
  \ husband last week, that is, my father.\u2019 \nI am astonished at how quickly\
  \ her mother has moved on. Completely different from the way we mourn.\n\u2018She\
  \ says to compliment you - that you look peaceful,\u2019 she adds. \nI had felt\
  \ certain buoyancy since my arrival, a lifting of burdens.\n\u2018She says that\
  \ whenever she looks into my eyes, she sees her lost husband. And that makes her\
  \ happy.\u2019 \nI was astounded at that revelation - embarrassed at my harsh judgement.\
  \ It radiated the joie de vivre.\nAt Shakespeare & Co, I dive into the words of\
  \ Hemingway, Kerouac and Baudelaire. But this remarkable woman has made me experience\
  \ it.  To live in the present moment \u2013 with no regrets \u2013 only love. \n\
  Playwright Sacha Guitry said \u2018Being a Parisian is not about being born in Paris\
  \ - it is about being reborn there.\u2019  I have returned home with one souvenir\
  \ \u2013 the satori of Paris inside me."
