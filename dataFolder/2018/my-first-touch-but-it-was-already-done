Text: "How would that happen? All was well, unless I received that call.It was more\
  \ arid there than I thought and added sunny, than I imagined.The only thing, which\
  \ I could find there, was a dry plain area with least sign of green and it was a\
  \ prolonging road to travel just by walk.I could see rodents cuddling with my shoes.I\
  \ could not turn back, yet I had to find a mode to reach there.I was sweaty, my\
  \ skin tanned, body got dehydrated, but still I should drive, for him. Suddenly,\
  \ I heeded a noise, more of a tapping sound.As I gaited along, the thud appeared\
  \ on a fastening beat which raged my pulse.A shock of realm obstructed me from further\
  \ movement, as I had never spotted such a scenic beauty in my lifetime.It was black,\
  \ and high, that it could not be reached very easily, and there comes a troop of\
  \ wild horses,running against me rampantly.With an urge, I pushed myself back, and\
  \ leaned against a rock that was adjacent to me, closing my eyes.I manipulated,\
  \ that I might go fainting, but the next moment I heard a reverberation from behind,\
  \ which was once again the thud.I sealed my eyes tight that it was going to hit\
  \ me, for sure, rather it traversed me.Surprisingly, when I opened my eyes, I did\
  \ witness someone sitting on that passing horse, riding, and he was shouting \u201C\
  Everyone can come\u201D shoving his hands, without turning his head.I made sure\
  \ it was a message to me.I spirited up, and found a horse which was a bit smaller\
  \ when compared with the others.I did crazy stuffs with actions to begin my ride.\
  \ May be, he was a mystery man who didn\u2019t even turned up his face to me. I\
  \ could not recess myself beyond thinking about that love story, even at that terrifying\
  \ moment. We never talked much, hugged or kissed but loved with all our hearts.Somehow,\
  \ I did reached to the place, where I could barely see the neighbours standing out\
  \ at his house.I jumped from the horse, and I stepped forward into the house, and\
  \ there he was lying with eyes inaccessible, but still breathing decelerated.Tears\
  \ were overflowing down my cheeks.It was a sudden cardiac arrest 2 days back that\
  \ made him to move unconsciousness.I touched his hands, and palm which was cold\
  \ and then I realised it was already done.I was parted, for almost 8 years from\
  \ him running for the future ours, but then it was ruined to the extent where it\
  \ would never brought back to.I shared money, gifts, but then I realised was that,\
  \ he least expected, that from me rather it was my time. And what love could be\
  \ greater than an Indian father like him?"
