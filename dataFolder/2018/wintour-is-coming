Text: "The bus that drove me from Boston to New York left me at Fashion Avenue.\n\n\
  It was there in the midst of the irony that I unwillingly put in motion this story,\
  \ by deciding to wear a comfy uniform every day to save time and to walk around\
  \ the city freed of fashion ties \u2013 ties that I love to see on Vogue Magazine\
  \ and Instagram- but not on me. Said uniform was as follows: pajama shorts, ankle\
  \ socks, catholic school shoes. The shoes were added later that day after I went\
  \ to Washington Square Park in flip-flops and my calves almost burst.\n\nNevertheless\
  \ one week and 14 subway rides -that left me on the wrong places- later, I felt\
  \ part of the city. I got used to the summer heat and to walk until the blisters\
  \ appeared. I went to Central Park, the beach, Coney Island and visited tons of\
  \ museums.\n\nThis story takes place at the MET, where I spent an entire day, wandering\
  \ around through history, fashion and the REAL things: the real Egyptian tomb, the\
  \ real roman columns, the real paintings, the real dresses. The real Anna Wintour.\n\
  \nYes. The day I almost met Anna Wintour -editor in chief of Vogue Magazine- I was\
  \ wearing a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles shirt and my New York attire.\n\nI looked\
  \ like I was part of the museum, petrified as I was, surrounded by medieval armors\
  \ and banners. From a corner I saw Anna and the long line of stylish and sleek women\
  \ waiting to meet her. Later I learnt that she was there to sign the stylish and\
  \ sleek women's copies of the Exhibition Catalogue from the Met\u2019s major fashion\
  \ exhibition that year.\n\nHalf of my brain wanted to kick myself for not looking\
  \ fabulous in the city I was supposed to. The other half was facing a dilemma: should\
  \ I buy the catalogue and let her throw a disdain look at my clothes? Or should\
  \ I just go away and disappear among the crowd of middle age white people wearing\
  \ fanny packs and sandals, who looked just as fashion blind as me? I texted my friends.\
  \ Their replies? \"Do it, do it\" I also texted my mom \"do it, do it\". \n\nThe\
  \ daylight was fading. Looking gloomy I left the building and sat at the MET stairs\
  \ to eat a pretzel:  I needed some sort of closure; my story couldn\u2019t end like\
  \ that. As I stood up to leave I saw her. She was leaving too. The limousine was\
  \ waiting for her, the assistant was waiting next to the door, the driver will close\
  \ it. I saw her, her iconic hair, her iconic sandals. \n\nI saw Anna Wintour without\
  \ the crowd and maybe just maybe, without the crowd she saw me."
