Text: "It was during spring in early May, when I moved to a small town in the forests\
  \ of northern Ontario. After having my last job fire me and with no other alternatives,\
  \ I found myself working in a local gift shop, living in a rustic cabin supplied\
  \ by the shops owners and wondering how I was truly going to make this work. After\
  \ starting my job, I decided I would invest some energy into taking in the culture\
  \ that was offered here. In the town of Sioux Narrows the main source of revenue\
  \ and entertainment all come from fishing.  With more fish shacks to try out than\
  \ restaurants, the town brings in people from all over the world. While exploring\
  \ I met a fisherman named Skyler. We chatted and I explained to him how I had come\
  \ here looking for a new outlook on life. He offered some advice, eventually that\
  \ advice led to conversations which would then turn into lessons and with the favorable\
  \ weather our lessons into full on day excursions. Such as fishing off docks or\
  \ walking down the highway. Skylar himself was very different than the other men\
  \ in town. He was born and raised in the woods. Living off the land, he was taught\
  \ to hunt and fish earlier than he could walk or talk. Having such a nomadic lifestyle\
  \ let him decide rather not to keep track of time, instead using the seasons as\
  \ his calendar and the sun as his clock. Literally the fish and their migration\
  \ were the only things he truly kept track of. He relied on his boat and did not\
  \ possess a cellphone for lack of need. Maps hung in place of posters across his\
  \ bedroom walls and you could just forget Wi-Fi. The more he taught me the more\
  \ I learned about him and how unique he truly was. As summer progressed so could\
  \ our activities. At one point I found myself scaling cliffs, in search of ancient\
  \ Native American cave paintings. Things I would have never imagined doing if it\
  \ weren\u2019t thanks to him. Even during the not so great times that came along\
  \ with the good like thunderstorms or the abundant black bears, it felt like our\
  \ adventures were endless. But when the seasons started to change, I knew our time\
  \ was limited. As the days grew shorter and colder, Skyler made his way on boat\
  \ to a distant and isolated island. There he would happily spend the winter gorging\
  \ on fish we had caught that year. I returned to the city which I had abandoned\
  \ months ago to find a part of me would always stay in Sioux after all, as if from\
  \ a different time."
