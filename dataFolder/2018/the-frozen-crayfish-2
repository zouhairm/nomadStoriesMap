Text: "Kaikoura is a peninsula on the east coast of the South Island, 2.5 hours north\
  \ of Christchurch. Had this sleepy township not become New Zealand\u2019s whale\
  \ watching mecca, it would be little more than fisherman\u2019s best kept secret.\
  \ The rich oceans make for a naturalist\u2019s dream. You need not board a boat\
  \ to bear witness to this wild abundance, an arm of the Southern Alps sweeps behind\
  \ the coast creating a spectacular backdrop and wealth of short and long walks.\
  \ \nThe town itself is nothing special, the centre comprises of a high street which\
  \ does a thriving lunch trade due to throngs of tourists but evening come, it is\
  \ eerie-quiet. My disorganisation led to us booking the only bach (Kiwi speak for\
  \ holiday house) left in Kaikoura. It was cheap, shabby and delectable to flies.\
  \ We adhered to a strict shoe-on policy as they were disturbingly attracted to the\
  \ carpets. Our bach (named \u201CThe Palace\u201D\u2026!) faced a harbour which\
  \ turned out to be the port for tourist attractions. Whale Watching Kaikoura run\
  \ a shipshape operation with boats departing every hour. It appears there is a corresponding\
  \ tour for every local species, from our sunny patio we also observed \u201CSunset\
  \ Seal Kayakers\u201D, \u201CDolphin Encounter\u201D and \u201CThe Rodfather\u201D\
  .\nOur hosts lived behind our bach. Tom was great, he always chugging on a roll-up\
  \ despite some form of lung disease. He gave us an overview of the businesses around\
  \ the port. He ascertained that we hadn\u2019t been out to sea and offered to take\
  \ us to check his lobster pots. I was delighted by this because I had planned on\
  \ trying crayfish but balked at the cost and backed out. Kaikoura means \u201Cto\
  \ eat crayfish\u201D in Maori, so I was glad to be seeing, if not eating one.\n\
  Tom had three lobster pots which we pulled up from the depths, but sadly they had\
  \ been pilfered by poachers. We took turns steering and viewed seals basking on\
  \ the rocks. Tom said that professional \u2018seal shoo-ers\u2019 were employed\
  \ during the rebuilding of the SH1 highway, because seals would get in the way of\
  \ the diggers. He also insisted the quake had been a good thing despite the odd\
  \ death and infrastructural devastation, because it put Kaikoura on the map and\
  \ business was booming!\nLater that evening, Tom knocked at the Palace and presented\
  \ us with two crayfish from his freezer after hearing that I\u2019d never tried\
  \ one. They were tender, delicious and most worthy of their renown. All was forgiven\
  \ for our rotting bach, my memories of Kaikoura will remain forever sweet thanks\
  \ to Tom\u2019s kindness."
