Text: "As part of a course in wildlife skills, I took part in a game-capture event\
  \ - an amazing experience I will never forget. \n\nGame capture is not for the faint-hearted;\
  \ a lot can go wrong so it is vital to follow all instructions. The event can be\
  \ traumatic for animals and lead to injury or worse. \n\nIt is important to remember\
  \ that you are dealing with live animals, that are unpredictable when cornered.\
  \ As part of the preparation, we set up a boma, the temporary corral that animals\
  \ would be herded into.\n\nThe day started early, heavy duty metal wiring had to\
  \ be looped from tree to tree, and heavy tarps carried deep into the bush and attached\
  \ to the wiring.  The \u2018entrance\u2019 was left open but could be pulled closed\
  \ like a curtain once all animals were inside. \n\nDuring the briefing, the chopper\
  \ pilot told us what signals he would use so we would know when the event started\
  \ and when the last of the animals had entered the boma. Once they were in, the\
  \ \u2018entrance\u2019 could be closed.\n\nWe were all assigned a role, with an\
  \ experienced member of the came capture team right beside us. \n\nAnd then it was\
  \ time. The pilot started the engines, the rotor blades whirred and before we knew\
  \ it, he was soaring above us. Then, the first signal. The zebra were to be relocated\
  \ and had to be handled with the utmost care. During the last sighting of the animals,\
  \ one of the mares had been in foal.\n\nSuddenly we had a stampede unfolding right\
  \ in front of our eyes, an emotional moment. We were only too aware that the slightest\
  \ mistake could result in injury or worse to wildlife or ourselves.\n\nThen, the\
  \ second siren, the last zebra had entered the boma. Those who, despite the crazy\
  \ action around us, attempted to take pictures saw it first \u2013 no pregnant mare\
  \ but a small foal, some 2-3 weeks old, doggedly following its mum.  \n\nThe last\
  \ thing we wanted to see was any animals get hurt, especially the mother and her\
  \ precious foal, so we worked as fast as we could, keeping voices down to ensure\
  \ that the animals would feel as little stress as possible. Stressed animals can\
  \ develop \u2018capture myopathy\u2019, an important cause of death in captured\
  \ animals. The reason is generally stress created though the pursuit by helicopter\
  \ or vehicles, exposure to strange noises and smells and the presence of unknown\
  \ people. Other factors that can contribute are close proximity of other animals,\
  \ and capture trucks or the effects of tranquilizers.  I am delighted to say that\
  \ all survived the experience unscathed."
