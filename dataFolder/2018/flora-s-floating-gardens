Text: "She answers to the name Flora. She has one of those names that somehow ends\
  \ up determining someone\u2019s life. She tells us that her parents and her grandparents\
  \ as well as her kids and grandkids have dedicated their lives to the chinampas,\
  \ a mesoamerican agricultural style, where local producers have been working the\
  \ land they live in for more than 500 years.\nFlora greets us in the only restaurant\
  \ in town\u200A \u200Awith a plastic blue basket on the right hand and a hat on\
  \ the other one. She is wearing a long sleeved blouse embroidered with distinctive\
  \ colors that show an image close to her heart: fisherman in a boat.\nNowadays,\
  \ the channel we see has only 20 centimeters of depth. It can go to 1.60 meters\
  \ in a luck year. Before, it was at least 3 meters of depth. The water system of\
  \ Ejidos de Xochimilco besides being considered a world heritage and a cultural\
  \ milestone for Mexico, it also is worldly acclaimed for its environment importance.\
  \ Flora insists that often she finds herself amongst academics and scientifics from\
  \ all the corners of the world to take water samples and know more about the ecosystem\
  \ in hopes to find some information that can help stop the climate change. \u201C\
  If this parcels did not exist, the City would have no water\u201D Flora tells us.\
  \ \nI ask her why more and more, people are abandoning the chinampa lifestyle. Flora\
  \ answers that is a social problem, because parents threaten their kids saying education\
  \ must come first, and if not, \u201Cthey will end up in the chinampa\u201D. Her\
  \ family has made it their mission to preserve the tradition and to study: her son,\
  \ Pedro, is both a chinampero and a librarian.\nBack in the water channel, Flora\
  \ tells us about the Prince Charles of England visit, 3 years ago. She points out\
  \ from the boat, the land where the Prince was. She tells us that the Royal bodyguards\
  \ fell off the boat and got really mad. I tell her that the TV news did not feature\
  \ that part, and she tells us that what was actually in the news was that he was\
  \ transported in \u201Can ugly boat\u201D. \u201CWe do not have \"trajineras\" -the\
  \ colorful boats in the touristic channel-, we use the boats for production and\
  \ transportation. We are not a resort\u201D.\nFlora interrupts this idea by sharing\
  \ her thoughts: \u201C What a though life\u201D. \u201CA prince\u2019s life?\u201D\
  , I ask.\u201CThat life. Filled with bodyguards. He travels even with an ambulance,\
  \ as if every time he was in the edge of an accident. There is nothing as beautiful\
  \ as to live a quiet life, sleep in the soil. Eat hand made tortillas...\u201D"
