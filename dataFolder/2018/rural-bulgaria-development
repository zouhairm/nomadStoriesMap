Text: "Looking for escape from chilly and rainy Latvian summer, I went to Bulgaria\
  \ ready to see, try and involve in everything it offers to me. Together with young\
  \ adults from 5 other countries we spent a week in a small town Strelcha, 110 km\
  \ away from the capital city of Bulgaria, to find out how rural areas could be developed\
  \ and how different practices sustain them.From the very first meeting with a member\
  \ of the organizer team, we got to know Bulgarian friendliness and sense of humor.\
  \ Although a very few people speak English or Russian there, locals tried to help\
  \ us in every possible way and showed their hospitality. We learned to collaborate\
  \ by using skills each of us has got. Thus, we managed to understand what locals\
  \ said to us and explain our thoughts to them. Now I see how useful it is to be\
  \ able to speak in several languages.The program of the week included various workshops,\
  \ presentations, visits to local businesses, meeting with a mayor of Strelcha, museum\
  \ tours and culture evenings. It was inspiring to listen to family\u2019s success\
  \ story who runs rose and lavender oil production business in the small town Panagyurishte.\
  \ They started with little and still are at the beginning, yet I noticed their passion\
  \ and wish to develop. One of the most unforgettable experiences was meeting with\
  \ a municipality mayor. It was worthwhile to compare accomplished things, future\
  \ goals and benefits that government offers to locals in order to make them stay\
  \ in hometown and feel economically secure and happy in the environment with achievements\
  \ of my local government. I felt very thoughtful after an hour in mayor\u2019s office\
  \ and even more questions raised. What can we learn from experiences of the other\
  \ country? How can we implement ideas in our environment? Is one strategy applicable\
  \ to any other setting? Is fresh air and beautiful nature enough to make youth stay\
  \ in rural area?Interesting evening was conducted by Bulgarians \u2013 from traditional\
  \ welcoming of guests with freshly baked bread with spices to national costumes.It\
  \ would not be fair to finish this article without mentioning nature of Bulgaria.\
  \ I received so long awaited sunrays on my skin, stared in awe at mountains that\
  \ encircle Pazardzhik District (where Strelcha and Panagyurishte are located), treated\
  \ my body with a swim in a hot, mineral water filled pool and got vitamins from\
  \ just picked cherries right from a tree. Bulgaria has rich historical, cultural\
  \ and natural heritage, therefore it calls for the next visit!"
