Text: "Amidst the infinite patchwork of cultures and colours of India, there are unique\
  \ places to be discovered and moments to be experienced. My moments came from Dharamsala,\
  \ a town in northern India and home to many Tibetan refugees.\n\nAfter completing\
  \ a TESOL course, I travelled to Dharamsala to teach English. One morning, while\
  \ having breakfast, a monk approached me and asked, \u201CAre you a teacher?\u201D\
  \ When I replied that I taught English, a smile spread across his face. He was searching\
  \ for a teacher to help with his English, but was too shy to join a class. His name\
  \ was Woser.\n\nWoser is from Amdo, Tibet. His family are farmers in a village with\
  \ yaks and sheep, surrounded by mountains and rivers. They may not be financially\
  \ wealthy but they are rich in spirit, compassion and kindness. Tibetan families\
  \ often send their children to monasteries to ensure they receive an education.\
  \ Woser was one of those children.\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of the Dalai Lama\
  \ \u2013 whose residence is in Upper Dharamsala - Woser travelled to India with\
  \ 26 people in search of a better life. From Lhasa, in Tibet, they walked for 24\
  \ days through the Himalayas. It was a journey of patience, \u201CPatience within\
  \ ourselves and patience with others\u201D, Woser recalled.\n\nDuring the first\
  \ 7 days, they walked at night, to avoid being caught by the army. They were afraid\
  \ and hungry. Their feet suffered badly and they experienced snow-blindness. At\
  \ times, they felt discouraged but were strengthened by their philosophy: \u201C\
  One must train the mind. It\u2019s difficult to think the right thing. When you\
  \ have negative thoughts, clear your mind.\u201D\n\nWhen they reached India, they\
  \ felt relieved and grateful for surviving the journey: \u201CAppreciating the present\
  \ is important. You must be thankful for what you have and not worry about what\
  \ you do not have.\u201D But what kept them going was the power of their minds:\
  \ \u201COne can overcome great hardship if one has a strong mind.\u201D\n\nWoser\
  \ is now chief editor in Kirti Monastery in Dharamsala, editing books on Buddhism,\
  \ grammar and history. When not at the monastery, he can be found in the mountains,\
  \ meditating. \u201CThe universe speaks to everyone and we must listen. Sometimes\
  \ there are signs; sometimes we get a feeling. Everything and everyone has a purpose.\u201D\
  \ I may have been his English teacher, but I was also his student.\n\nAs global\
  \ travel continues to boom, in an age of selfies, it is important to stop, reflect,\
  \ look deeper and connect. Only then can the real benefits of travel be realised."
