Text: "At a bus stop in Yangshuo, the bus isn't coming. It might never.\n\nA Chinese\
  \ man makes a comment about it. Asks where I am going; Guilin. So is he. We wait\
  \ 40 minutes for the bus before splitting a cab instead. It takes 5 minutes and\
  \ costs RMB 15 ($3).\n\n'GUILIN!' at least 5 people are shouting when we pull into\
  \ the gravel-strewn bit of land that calls itself Yangshuo Bus Station. Yangshuo\
  \ has a Starbucks, but its bus station doesn't have asphalt. In the space of 7 seconds,\
  \ we\u2019re on board. David is my companion's name in English, or Fung in Chinese.\
  \ I ask him what he thinks my Chinese name would be.\n\n'I think you need to learn\
  \ the language, then you'll know what your name is.'\n\nIf I ever do learn Mandarin\
  \ I'll add a footnote. The bus stops at lonely buildings and street corners amongst\
  \ the hazy karsts to collect more passengers. It\u2019s slower than I need it to\
  \ be. I still need to get to Nanning from Guilin.\n\n'I'm from Nanning!' David says.\
  \ But I'm not staying, I say, just getting another train to Hanoi. One train leaves\
  \ from Nanning to Hanoi at 18:05 every day.\n\nI don\u2019t have a ticket to Nanning\
  \ yet. Or cash (stations do not accept cards), or a card that works reliably in\
  \ China. In Guilin I drip feed this news to David, who is now in the sorry position\
  \ of feeling responsible for me. We run past the station looking for an ATM. \n\n\
  The first one we find doesn\u2019t work.\n\n\u2018You know they close ticket sales\
  \ 15 minutes before the train leaves.\u2019\n\nI know he is only trying to help\
  \ but my heart sinks. The second ATM works.\n\n\u2018Maybe I can buy the ticket\
  \ on my phone\u2019\n\nThat will take longer. They need passport numbers, names,\
  \ dates of birth. I run into the ticket hall, which teems with queues of people.\
  \ David, my guardian angel, steps forward. Manically explaining my situation to\
  \ people in line, we get let into the front. I show the salesman the train I want.\n\
  \nThere are no tickets.\n\n\u2018Standing is fine.\u2019\n\nHe shakes his head.\
  \ Defeated, I know I deserve this. \n\nDavid takes over and gets me two tickets.\
  \ Changing in Liuzhou with an hour wait. Metro from Nanning East to Nanning Central.\
  \ An hour, maybe. I will arrive just in time. I thrust money at the ticket counter.\
  \ Do whatever you need to. I get my tickets and I am shaking. I hug David. I tell\
  \ him to email me.\n\n\u2018I think maybe I should have just left you at Guilin\u2019\
  \ David said, smiling. Probably not without a touch of sincerity. Maybe he should\
  \ have. Boarding the train to Hanoi that evening, I quietly thank him for sticking\
  \ it out."
