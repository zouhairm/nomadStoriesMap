Text: "I'd done it.  I'd been accepted to join with a student group visiting South\
  \ Africa and Swaziland for two weeks, working as volunteers in humanitarian and\
  \ wildlife projects!  Throughout my early life, the nature documentaries and current\
  \ affairs programs that my father so loved for us to watch as a family had diffused\
  \ into my own bank of interests and loves.  Now I was going to see these things\
  \ with my own naked eyeballs!  The was an eight month interim before departing,\
  \ so I set about researching what I could see and do while I was there.  \n\nI quickly\
  \ found that my destination, the magnificent St Lucia Estuary in Kwa Zulu Natal,\
  \ hosts nesting Loggerhead and Leatherback turtles, that their egg-laying time coincided\
  \ with my trip in November, and that tours to see nesting turtles were available!\
  \  Also that hippos often walk the streets of St. Lucia after dark!  My excitement\
  \ drowned out the voices of the nay-sayers around me who couldn't understand why\
  \ I'd want to go to such a dangerous and violent place as South Africa.  A Facebook\
  \ group for my volunteer organisation had been developed, so I used it to ask if\
  \ anyone else wanted to come and see the nesting turtles with me one evening, when\
  \ the tours ran.\n\nQuite soon after, I received contact from someone who said he\
  \ was part of the group and would be joining us in November in St Lucia.  We continued\
  \ to talk most days and became fast friends.  He was from the Democratic Republic\
  \ of Congo.  Over the next five months, I learned about his life experiences: the\
  \ Rwandan Genocide, war and the tragic, heart-breaking history of DRC.  Through\
  \ my new friend, I learned of Virunga National Park and I fell in love with north-eastern\
  \ DRC through the words, pictures and stories he shared with me about his amazing\
  \ homeland.  I wanted to go and see those gorillas, too!  When he suggested I come\
  \ to Africa a week early to spend some time together ahead of our volunteering,\
  \ I hesitated... but not for long.  I changed my flights, booked my hotel and a\
  \ hire-car, and looked forward to my trip.  I emailed the volunteer group to let\
  \ them know we'd both be arriving in St Lucia ahead of the rest of the group.  They\
  \ replied that they'd never heard of my friend...\n\nIn the end, I hyper-vigilantly\
  \ went ahead with the trip, as booked - including the turtle tour, but minus my\
  \ friend.  My friend is again my friend today, with new understanding healing the\
  \ hurt and fear caused at the time.  He opened my eyes to the world, and I'm grateful."
