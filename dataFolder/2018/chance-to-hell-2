Text: "The biggest funny thing in my life is to imagine that five years ago, even\
  \ with fifteen years, I couldn't  separate in my mide that Africa is a whole incredible\
  \ and huge continent. Even more If you think that today I study geography. But when\
  \ my dad told my family would move to Namibia, I just thought about no food, sad\
  \ people and bad internet. One day I was watching TV, some documentary about one\
  \ african tribe who killed white people to make bracelets and necklaces and I started\
  \ to cry thinking I was going to die. I clearly needed to go to Africa. My family\
  \ got ready for three months and even then when big day arrived, we were not ready.\
  \ We were three women accompanying the man who loved to the hell, at least for me.\
  \ Today I can separe my life in two levels, before and after Walvis Bay. I grew\
  \ up as a woman, as a person and as a human. When I got there, I was greeted with\
  \ love and smiles. Until today, I have never met people as nice as the namibians.\
  \ But I took time to give that place a chance. \nWe start with the choice of house.\
  \ My previous idea that I would live in some kind of tree was totally wrong. I did\
  \ not even know there houses of that size. We chose one that had jacuzzi, sauna,\
  \ two rooms and a yard that would give to save all the street dogs of the world.\
  \ \nThen school. We was late, most of schools had no space for new students. My\
  \ father is an insistent man, after eight meetings managed to convince the director\
  \ to accept, for the first time, two Brazilians in school, me and my sister started\
  \ in Dolphins School. I felt like a rat in my first day. Everyone was looking at\
  \ me like I had something purple and green in my body. So I chose to stay with kids\
  \ at the beginning, until I give people with my age a chance and make friends for\
  \ the rest of my life.\nAnd the lastly, be a tourist. I would like to have my geographical\
  \ eye look the days I lived in Walvis Bay. The desert with the ocean, the animals,\
  \ the wind, the food... everything in that place looks like match. \nWhat began\
  \ as a trip to hell, became a miss for paradise. That still came with a new sister.\
  \  No one can ever get the right expectations about Namibia, so you have to go there\
  \ to find what is waiting for you."
