Text: "The last thing I expected to find when I boarded the plane from my small town,\
  \ was the colorful city that changed my life. The decision was on a whim and the\
  \ idea half-baked, but it was easily the best decision I\u2019ve ever made. When\
  \ I arrived in Haderslev, Denmark I had no idea what I had gotten myself into. I\
  \ was so overwhelmed the first time I heard Danish being spoken, I excused myself\
  \ to cry in the privacy of my temporary bedroom. On later review, the conversation\
  \ was about the garden that had been recently redone, but for a small town girl\
  \ - it was as if an alien had come down from the cosmos and asked how my day was.\
  \ It wouldn\u2019t take long, however, for me to fall in love with the beautiful\
  \ landscape of Denmark and come to appreciate the uniqueness of the Danish language\
  \ and people. \n     The story begins with my host mother Heidi and host sister\
  \ Kristina taking me on a bike ride to get ice cream after dinner my first night.\
  \ This was my first glimpse of the city that I would call my home for next year.\
  \ They took me up and down the hills, I quickly realized how out of shape I was,\
  \ showing off historical, bright homes that lined cobble stone roads. It was fantasy\
  \ meet reality, the backdrop only found in media, little cafes and adorable shops\
  \ filled the city, and beautiful houses that kept their windows open to feel the\
  \ kind breeze come off the fjord. \n         Every place I visited, I breathed in\
  \ the history which had filled each stone that made up the thousand year old church,\
  \ or the beautiful castle that sat atop the hill. However, while the city dated\
  \ back to before 1292, the Danes have an uncanny ability to combine history with\
  \ the modern. It was common to see old stone wedged next to new steel, and it was\
  \ done with such a reverence for the past that it was as if it was all one piece.\
  \ Each new direction held a different landscape; the north beautiful white beaches,\
  \ west you would find the forested nature reserve, east was the frigid fjord, and\
  \ south brought you the flat planes that lead to Germany.  \n        When you live\
  \ your whole life seeing in black and white you don't realize you're missing out.\
  \ When you spend your whole life going without knowing true joy you aren't actually\
  \ concerned. This tiny town hidden away in the south of Denmark opened my eyes to\
  \ the truth. For the first time I saw the city in color, and I knew that I had to\
  \ continue; there was no turning back once I had found true joy exploring my new\
  \ home."
