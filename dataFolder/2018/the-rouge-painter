Text: "I didn\u2019t understand it at first; how a city of creamy limestone punctuated\
  \ by grey-brown river could evoke such vivid colours in my mind. The red passion\
  \ of couples sauntering along the Seine hand in hand, calm blue mornings dedicated\
  \ to languidly sipping bitter coffee, yellow joy of buttery air filling my nostrils\
  \ every time I stepped out of my creaky bedroom into the web of narrow streets.\
  \ \n\nFor five days I wandered the uneven sidewalks of Paris, alone with my thoughts\
  \ in a haze of inspiration. Even when the cobblestones finally conquered the sole\
  \ of my left sandal, I was able to romanticise the thought of an agonising four\
  \ kilometre shuffle back to my lonely apartment. \n\nI was crossing Pont des Arts\
  \ \u2013 fitting, as I had not crossed half the bridge when a woman\u2019s voice\
  \ called out, \u201CDo you like this man\u2019s painting?\u201D\n\nI looked up,\
  \ expecting to see the same watercolour cityscapes that were scattered around every\
  \ other street \u2013 charming, but familiar. As I later learned, the painter and\
  \ woman were merely acquainted through a daily exchange of greetings; yet here she\
  \ stood, wild enthusiasm glimmering in her eyes as she watched mine meet an abstract\
  \ female figure on canvas. \u201CIt\u2019s beautiful\u201D I breathed. Their faces\
  \ grinned widely at me, and she, seemingly satisfied, left with a cheerful au revoir.\n\
  \nThe painter handed me a brush. \u201CYou will put some rouge on painting?\u201D\
  \ he asked. I eagerly obliged, splashing a red streak through the figure\u2019s\
  \ hair.\n\nAs we stood watching the Seine sparkle in the evening sun, the painter\
  \ confided that he sat in this spot every day, watching people pass. \u201CWatching\
  \ is what we do,\u201D he said. \u201CIf you look very close, you can even see the\
  \ artists from long ago\u201D. \n\nI understood then, why everything here shone\
  \ so vibrantly: pure art was beating through the city\u2019s very veins, subtle\
  \ and constant. \n\nHe asked if I would come back to paint rouge on tomorrow\u2019\
  s canvas. I told him that I was leaving that night. \u201CYou will visit in your\
  \ head, then!\u201D he stated, ruffling through his art supplies. He picked out\
  \ a fern green pencil and placed it in my palm. It was the same brilliant colour\
  \ as the trees lining the river. \n\n\u201CCarry always. It will bring luck for\
  \ creating, wherever you go.\u201D\n\u201CDon\u2019t you need this green, for your\
  \ art?\u201D I asked.\n\u201CI already have green inside,\u201D he said, tapping\
  \ his chest. \u201CLook where I am!\u201D \n\nI smiled at our secret, shared knowledge\
  \ of the green luck, the blue serenity, the yellow bliss, the rouge passion of Paris."
