Text: "Students from around the country were enjoying breakfast and going over their\
  \ daily itineraries for their unique courses being hosted by Semester At Sea, an\
  \ organization that re-invented study abroad by hosting a \u201Cfloating campus\u201D\
  \ that sails worldwide. Today\u2019s destination: Corinto, Nicaragua. \u201CBeach\
  \ day and some souvenir shopping right?\u201D I na\xEFvely asked my classmate Ashley.\
  \ She shoved a flyer in my hand. \u201CABSOLUETLY NOT,\u201D she firmly replied.\
  \ I glanced at the flyer, \u201CI\u2019ve never surfed before, and I\u2019m not\
  \ the best swimmer but I\u2019ve always wanted to try.\u201D\u201CLook again Dedra.\
  \ We\u2019re not headed to the beach.\u201DI took another look and my stomach sank.\
  \ The flyer was for volcano surfing. Cerro Negro, the world\u2019s youngest and\
  \ most active cinder cone volcano, is a tourist attraction where people plop on\
  \ a wooden plank and board down the forty-one degree angled hill. \u201CABSOLUTELY\
  \ NOT!\u201D I yelled as I balled up the flyer and tossed it at Ashley. My decision\
  \ was firm. Until my instructor, Dr. Mills, chimed in.\u201CI\u2019ll write the\
  \ recommendation letter you need for that summer internship if you go\u201D. Dr.\
  \ Mills, the most renowned instructor in the program, had turned down my request\
  \ for a letter of recommendation three times. Two and a half hours later I was sitting\
  \ on top of a wooden plank in a neon orange jumpsuit on the edge of having a nervous\
  \ breakdown. The sour smell of the ash invaded my pores and nostrils adding to the\
  \ queasy sensation I felt. The goggles and helmet created a sense of claustrophobia\
  \ that I couldn\u2019t shake, and underneath that ugly jumpsuit I was sweating profusely.\
  \ I inhaled deeply and mumbled under my breath, \u201CCerro Negro, I need this recommendation\
  \ letter. Please respect my grind.\u201D I took a few scoots forward. Gravity did\
  \ the rest. The speed increased instantly and I flew. I tried to comprehend how\
  \ fast I was going and focused on not falling off the board. The crackle of the\
  \ ash and tiny pebbles under the wooden plank was startling at first, then strangely\
  \ gratifying. Through the rush of the wind against my ears I could hear the cheers\
  \ of my friends as I closed in on the bottom. I slid in at the base abruptly and\
  \ heard the guide yell \u201C43 kilometers! Fastest time down today!\u201D I stood\
  \ up slowly and caught my breath. I turned to face Cerro Negro and silently expressed\
  \ my gratitude. As I gazed at the volcano I felt a hand on my shoulder and turned\
  \ to see Dr. Mills. He proudly grinned and said, \u201CThis is gonna be one hell\
  \ of a recommendation letter Mitchell\u201D."
