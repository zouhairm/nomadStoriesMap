Text: "After a long day and an endless night of traveling, when I got off the bus\
  \ in Baracoa, the first Spanish settlement in Cuba, I engaged in casual conversation\
  \ with a Brazilian man. His name was Mota and, as he told me, he was making a photography\
  \ book about Cuba. That would be the last stop of his two months trip around the\
  \ country and his goal was to arrive at Mais\xED, the most oriental town of the\
  \ island, about 60 kilometers southeast. He suggested me to join him.\n\nAfter some\
  \ negotiations, we found a smiling driver willing to take us. Through the window\
  \ of his old Soviet car, we admired the generous tropical landscape of the Guantanamo\
  \ Province, but also its most devastating aspect: once in a while, you could see\
  \ the destructive effects of Hurricane Matthew, which had passed over the region\
  \ a few months before. When we left the last semi-destroyed hamlet behind, I could\
  \ glimpse the real aim of our trip, the lighthouse of Mais\xED. But we quickly discovered\
  \ that the place was not a big deal. Mota, with visible disappointment, devoted\
  \ himself to take some photographs, certainly not very noteworthy.\n\nI proposed\
  \ that we could walk by the coastline towards some buildings that seemed to be within\
  \ walking distance. We arrived at an esplanade on which three large sheds, whose\
  \ roofs had flown during the hurricane, rested together with another small building\
  \ in better conditions. Mota began to photograph everything. Suddenly, three soldiers\
  \ came out shouting that we must not be there.\n\nIt could have been a tense situation,\
  \ but the tone they used was as friendly as any other Cuban's. That place was, as\
  \ the officer in charge told me, a concentration camp for illegal Haitian immigrants.\
  \ Except for rows of rusted bunk beds, the sheds were empty then. However, those\
  \ had sheltered more than a thousand people.\n\nWe returned to Baracoa. Upon arriving\
  \ at my hostel room, I quickly fell into a deep sleep. In dreams, the lighthouse\
  \ of Mais\xED appeared to me in the middle of a violent storm, lighting in all directions\
  \ with frenzy. Occasionally, its beam of light hit on unknown faces with intense\
  \ and resilient eyes.\n\nThat afternoon at Mais\xED, I was struck because the sheds'\
  \ walls were free of any kind of human mark. Those places had been full of people\
  \ who had faced the unspeakable in the sea struggling for a better life. Yet, they\
  \ left nothing behind, not even a trace.\n\nIn my dream, instead, those walls were\
  \ cramped with messages."
