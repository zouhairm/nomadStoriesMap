Text: "People are good. Not the conclusion most would draw from my time in Marrakech.\
  \ What with catching that pickpocket with his hand in my backpack. The adolescent\
  \ boys who stalked me like I wasn\u2019t a mid-twenties adult but a foal cut from\
  \ the herd. The day I made the mistake of wearing a dress and Jamaa el Fna became\
  \ a nightmare of pinching and groping. The scarf seller who pushed me into the back\
  \ of his shop and let\u2019s face it...tried to assault me.\n Disclaimer - I am\
  \ not some floozy who doesn\u2019t respect cultural differences. I dressed conservatively,\
  \ kept my hair tied back or covered. I watched, I listened and stayed alert to where\
  \ I was and who eyed me with more than a cursory glance. Fact was I was tall, blonde\
  \ and alone. The kicker was that I like to smile; I smile at children, busy moms,\
  \ old men, awkward teenagers or anyone who just seems like they need it. Resiliently\
  \ instilled from my small town origin, when someone sees you, you smile and acknowledge\
  \ them. \n In a drum circle a mother of two looked back with apologetic eyes as\
  \ I am harassed by young men. I smile, as if to say, what can I do? Though there\
  \ is no space not covered with limbs in the gathering of Berber singers, the mother\
  \ ushers her children up and makes room for me beside her.\n I watch an old man\
  \ hand carve mosaic tiles. His tool slips from his hand and rolls away. Smiling\
  \ I return it and we exchange pleasantries in broken French. Soon enough I\u2019\
  m invited in for mint tea. He teases me about not having a husband and lets me try\
  \ carving the piece he\u2019s working on. A British guide arrives and my friend\u2019\
  s manner becomes very formal. The guide explains to her tour that the man working\
  \ here is famous, having designed the mosaics for the palace. He who\u2019d shared\
  \ tea with me for the last three hours.\n Leaving Marrakech a woman in the airport\
  \ said she knew me. Four days earlier I had sat on her stool with a hopeful smile,\
  \ told her I didn\u2019t want henna, I just needed to rest. She drew one as a gift.\
  \ Here now she had recognized me by her own flower on my hand. Huffing she balanced\
  \ her little girl on her hip and the bulging bag of spice in her arms. I took the\
  \ hefty bag and helped her to her gate. Fate made it easy, we were on the same flight.\n\
  \ To smile is a small kindness. It\u2019s the first sign you give of caring for\
  \ another\u2019s wellbeing. In those days being so free with my smiles cost me a\
  \ lot in unwanted attention however my memories of Marrakech are for those who\u2019\
  s kindness paid a debt not their own."
