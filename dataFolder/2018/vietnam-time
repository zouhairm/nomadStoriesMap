Text: "The Vietnamese sun penetrates my skin forcing droplets of sweat to stand at\
  \ attention. For those seeking escape, palm trees provide scarce shade and minimal\
  \ protection from the humid wind.\n\nI watch ants scatter into disarray as I drag\
  \ a stick through their trail. Puffs of dirt fill the air and fall like shrapnel\
  \ cutting them off in their tracks. A horn grumbles, announcing the presence of\
  \ a decrepit wooden boat.\n\n\u201CSee? Told ya. Vietnam time.\u201D A term Dazza-\
  \ a fellow Aussie- and I coined last night while drinking with locals in the street.\
  \ \u201CThings just happen when they happen.\u201D I vaguely remember yelling \u201C\
  m\u1ED9t, hai, ba, v\xF4!\u201D as our glasses clinked together and we chugged Bia\
  \ Hoi; A fresh beer with no preservatives yet a lethal amount of alcohol. \n\nI\
  \ sling my dusty backpack over my shoulders and steadily hop on board.  The crew-\
  \ a compilation of foreigners escaping the nine to five religion.\n\nI\u2019d been\
  \ traveling for a month on my own and somewhere in the last week my luck with street\
  \ food ran out, I was sick. I escaped to Phu Quoc- a small island off the coast\
  \ of Ho Chi Minh- seeking refuge from the disorganised chaos that ran through the\
  \ city\u2019s capital. \n\nDazza and I sit on the side of the boat watching the\
  \ turquoise water sparkle like a glossy travel magazine. \n\nFishing boats join\
  \ us on the horizon, one full charge in our direction.  I reassure myself; It won\u2019\
  t hit us. It\u2019s Vietnam time. My ears deafen to the conversations around me\
  \ as I\u2019m mesmerised by the waves crashing against the chipped teal paint.\n\
  \n\u201CAlisha.\u201D\n\nThe flag violently lashing at the mast.\n\n\u201CMove!\u201D\
  \n\nThe smell of fuel churning out the motor.\n \n\u201CIT\u2019S GOING TO CRASH!\u201D\
  \n\nI snap out of my fixation and leap away bracing myself for impact. Wooden shards\
  \ hurtle towards my face and I collapse like a rag doll scraping my knees on the\
  \ rigid fibreglass floor.\n\nThe boats untangle leaving a faint knocking as debris\
  \ bumps against the side of the boat while it drifts away in the current. \n\nSilence.\
  \ \n\nDazza squeezes my shoulder. \u201CYou okay? Crashed right into where you were\
  \ sitting.\u201D I muster a limp smile.  \n\nHours after filling out police reports\
  \ and swapping survivor stories at dinner, I slip away on my own.\n\nI nestle into\
  \ a secluded spot on the beach and look out on the merciless waters, the sunset\
  \ glittering me with regal shades of gold. I squeeze my eyes shut and the tightness\
  \ in my throat unravels tears that aid my sunburnt cheeks.\n\nI fumble for my phone,\
  \ dial. \u201CMum? Yeah, I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m just checking in.\u201D"
