Text: "I am a motorcyclist and travel a lot. When you are on roads, you end up eating\
  \ at local dhaabas (small highway restaurants) and spending nights in tents. It\
  \ is not hard to strike up a conversation with people. An exchange of pleasantries\
  \ with dhaaba owners, truck owners from around the country stopping there for rest\
  \ or meal or the villagers or farming land owners, where you camp for the night.\
  \ You can experience local culture and easily befriend a local.\nYou can have a\
  \ 2 day stay in a country, or live there for a year, it doesn\u2019t matter. You\
  \ will still have a more enriching experience if you spark up a friendship with\
  \ a stranger. Its very easy and simple to connect with locals.\n\nI think connecting\
  \ locally can be simple. You have to be open to hear their experience and not to\
  \ be hesitant or reluctant in accepting their culture. You don\u2019t have to travel\
  \ for extended period or go very far or cross country. You can start from a near\
  \ village. India is one country where culture changes every 100 kms and because\
  \ of which you get immense opportunities to connect with locals.\n\nOnce I was on\
  \ a motorcycle expedition covering approx 10000 kms spread across 9 states taking\
  \ a terrain which is normally untouched. Even after cautiously checking the route\
  \ and weather forecast, I got struck by heavy rainstorm. After riding for 9 days,\
  \ one day I was crossing a forest area where the populated areas were more than\
  \ 20 miles apart. And due to rainstorm I couldnt ride further. Thats when I found\
  \ my local connection in a form of a farmer who was taking his cattle away to safety.\
  \ He not only helped me out finding a place to sleep but also gave a taste of their\
  \ local cuisine. A warm and dry place to sleep with full belly, what else you can\
  \ ask for, it was pure heaven. I am still in touch with that person, keep sending\
  \ him postcard from wherever I travel to let him know that I am still thankful of\
  \ him and because of people like him, traveler/motocyclers like me can dare to travel\
  \ on any route they wish to.\n\nMaking a local connection can be as simple as finding\
  \ an authentic meal or having a chat with a local at the pub. The difference is\
  \ in the depth of relationship that you build based on the amount of time you have.\
  \  Whether you have one day or one year, every interaction is a connection to what\
  \ it means to live in a place."
