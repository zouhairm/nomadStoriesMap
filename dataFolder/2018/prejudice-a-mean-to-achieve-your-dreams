Text: "It was about 8pm when I took the bus from the Seoraksan National Park to Seoul.\
  \ It was cold and the horde of ghosts looking like fog should have done the weather\
  \ even colder, but all I could think about was how lucky I was for being on that\
  \ bus. My T-shirt looked like I just finished a soccer game, and my feet were so\
  \ swell that I had to loosen my laces a bit to can stand the trip. Sooner that day\
  \ (7am), I left the Hapjeong station in a 3 hour trip to get to one of the Biosphere\
  \ Protection sites declared by the Unesco, The Seoraksan National Park. As soon\
  \ as I arrived, a faint breeze touched my face and blew some of my hairs, the sky\
  \ was gray and the place had a wet wood smell that transported you immediately to\
  \ the middle of the forest. As I walked pass the Sinheungsa Temple, I started to\
  \ see some monumental rocks along with a dense forest, the fog was all over, but\
  \ you could still appreciate the magnificence of the place. The goal was to get\
  \ to the Ulsanbawi rock, a 3km trail from where I was. When I finally got to the\
  \ first lookout, the breathtaking views along with the monk\u2019s songs barely\
  \ heard in the distance, made the place an authentic experience. It must have been\
  \ 3pm when I found a couple who convinced me that I should climb back, as it was\
  \ already too late to be out there. We came together until the Ranger station, but\
  \ there was still one hour to get to the main entrance. It was getting dark so I\
  \ started running among wet wood, and wet metal bridges, suddenly my butt  touches\
  \ the ground I slipped twice, by the way don\u2019t use converse shoes for a field\
  \ day! Then, when I finally thought I was safe, I see this men in the distance.\
  \ A faint light illuminated the dark road, the last thing I wanted to find as a\
  \ women, was a men. I walked passed him trying to apparent courage. He started to\
  \ walk faster and I did the same, we walked one behind the other for about 10 minutes,\
  \ then he used a high tone to say some words in Korean, but I kept walking. He lowered\
  \ his tone and kept saying stuff behind me, but finally after some minutes, he stopped.\
  \ I felt my heart on my throat, we walked a few more meters and got to the main\
  \ entrance. He never attacked me, but I just lived the worse minutes of my life.\
  \ I realized one thing that day, we tend to judge people from the second we see\
  \ them. Therefore, the next time you want to achieve a goal or convince someone,\
  \ just pretend to be that person, the one who will achieve it. People will believe\
  \ it and eventually you'll become into that person."
