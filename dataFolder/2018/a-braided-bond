Text: "I felt a tug on my scalp as I put down my glass of mint tea and rose to return\
  \ to the din of the Moroccan medina. I turned to see what my hair caught on. My\
  \ long brown braids hung to the middle of my back, and tangled or tethered just\
  \ about anywhere. But instead of a snag, I saw a woman\u2019s hand grasping three\
  \ inches of my hair.\nHer small, wrinkled hand released all of the braids except\
  \ one. She held the braid and quietly rolled it between her fingers like a cigarette.\n\
  Safiya, an Amazigh woman and grandmother, lived outside the medina in Marrakech.\
  \ Although she\u2019d seen faces from sub-Saharan Africa, she\u2019d never been\
  \ close enough to examine their locks.\nShe stared at my hair then looked up, her\
  \ brow furrowed and eyes narrowed. I recognized the curiosity and questions in her\
  \ face. It\u2019s the same face my classmates wore the first time I rocked afro\
  \ puffs to school. In an odd way, being a minority at home prepares you for the\
  \ otherness of being a traveler.\nThe mul l-Hanut, who kept the jewelry shop we\
  \ stood in, translated her question. \u201CShe asked, \u2018Is this your hair?\u2019\
  \ She wants to know how you do this to your hair.\u201D\nHis cheerful tone momentarily\
  \ betrayed the complexity of the question. I sat back down and exhaled, noticing\
  \ the silver rings and bracelets twinkling in the fading sunlight. The story of\
  \ my hair, of black women\u2019s hair, is long and nuanced. I wondered how to convey\
  \ that in a brief conversation. Would the answer get lost in translation?\nI couldn\u2019\
  t immediately share the decades-long struggle it took for me to love and cherish\
  \ my hair. Nor could I explain that my hair symbolizes my own black girl magic.\n\
  Instead, I simply said, \u201CYes, it\u2019s my hair. I braid it myself. Here, I\
  \ can show you how.\u201D\nI unfurled half the length of a braid, showing how I\
  \ grip the strands of hair. Safiya leaned in to watch my hands at work. I folded\
  \ strand over strand showing the pattern of the plait. I thought, I\u2019m sharing\
  \ something new and novel with an old woman.\nBut while in Morocco, I realized my\
  \ braids weren\u2019t new at all, but old. Very old. Safiya\u2019s ancestors the\
  \ Imazighen, also known as Berbers, are an ethnic group indigenous to North Africa.\
  \ Like many African tribes, the Imazighen have traditions of hair braiding and adornment.\
  \ Online I found image after image of regal Imazighen women draped in elaborate\
  \ jewelry and crowns of braids.\nSuddenly, I felt at home. My beauty. My magic.\
  \ My hair. This is where it originated. In Morocco, and in Africa, my hair was no\
  \ foreign object."
