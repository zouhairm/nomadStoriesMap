Text: "\u201CWhy is this taking us so long!\u201D I think to myself as our bus goes\
  \ through its third army checkpoint of the journey. Here I am traveling through\
  \ unfamiliar lands sitting next to a pretty girl who I\u2019m unable to communicate\
  \ with thinking to myself, am I ready for what\u2019s to come? Feeling uneasy as\
  \ we pass army soldiers with heavy assault rifles, doubt begins to breed deep within\
  \ my mind. It grows slightly larger as we approach a village and about 200 people\
  \ are standing on the highway apparently protesting. I am starting to feel a little\
  \ antsy.\n\nAntsy because I have seven weeks here in Colombia and can only sacrifice\
  \ two of them to make this long, multi-bus journey to La Paz, Bolivia where I plan\
  \ to ride out my dream of biking down Camino del Morte (Road of Death). \n\nIt has\
  \ been 24 hours since we left Medellin and we should\u2019ve reached our destination\
  \ by now. Instead, I\u2019m still on this bus, sweating, irritated and exhausted\
  \ and we still have another 12 hours to go! A wretched feeling creeps into my psyche\
  \ and my thoughts can\u2019t help but wonder if my dream will not come true.\n\n\
  Hours pass and we\u2019ve only moved a few measly kilometers when our bus comes\
  \ to a screeching halt. Just ahead of us we gaze in awe at an 18-wheeler spread\
  \ across the Pan-American Highway with its tires punctured and windshield smashed.\
  \ There must be 100 villagers (or are they guerrillas, I worry as my stomach sinks)\
  \ blocking the road and neighbouring terrain in defence positions while dozens of\
  \ National Army troops slowly advance past our bus throwing tear gas and smoke grenades.\
  \ I know now, it\u2019s probably over.\n\nMothers, babies and several other passengers\
  \ are screaming and crying. Suddenly, our windows are bombarded by rocks the size\
  \ of my hand while the soldiers and \u201Cguerrillas\u201D battle it out across\
  \ the highway. At this point, I realize the two bus drivers four feet in front of\
  \ me are pulling out their machetes from underneath their seats. My heart is racing;\
  \ it feels like it\u2019s bursting out of my chest. I find myself reaching into\
  \ my bag clasping my small but mighty pocketknife as I begin to tremble at what\u2019\
  s about to happen next...\n\nThis hellish nightmare continued for four more days\
  \ and had it not been for the grace of the locals, I may have not survived. As I\
  \ sit next to a soldier manning his minigun in this army helicopter, I watch from\
  \ above the poor Colombians who fell victim to a nationwide coffee protest; the\
  \ madness I\u2019m happy to leave behind."
