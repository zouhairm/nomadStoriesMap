Text: "When travelling across Manila, it takes a jeepney barker's smarts and a jeepney\
  \ driver's patience to navigate the labyrinth streets of the sprawling metropolis.\
  \ For one who wants a quick travel, there is the best option: by train. But, if\
  \ you can set aside the passable \"quality\" service, there\u2019s a lot of scenery\
  \ and experiences to behold here.\n\nFor the gist, there are four rail transits\
  \ within Metro Manila. In a rather unplanned way, I spent my typical vacant Tuesday\
  \ morning to ride, end-to-end, the two busiest rail lines: LRT-1 and MRT-3.\n\n\
  For the first part, I took the LRT line, starting from the station in the bustling\
  \ marketplace of Baclaran. Even from there, you\u2019ll expect a queue lined up.\
  \ So, better come early to save a good seat.\n\nBut you can get pass that as the\
  \ transit traverses across Old and New Manila. The scenic route starts in Pedro\
  \ Gil station as you get pass sights like some neoclassical government offices,\
  \ half of Rizal Park, the Greek column-inspired National Museum, the iconic Manila\
  \ City Hall clock tower, the art deco-brimmed Metropolitan Theater and the pill-shaped\
  \ Central Post Office.\n\nThe view gets larger as the train crosses Pasig River\
  \ and passes through the congested high-rises of Binondo, the Filipino Chinatown.\
  \ Sadly, the view ends in the twelfth station, Bambang. But at least I gained a\
  \ seat. From there, with fewer passengers, the ride becomes peaceful, almost therapeutic.\n\
  \nYet, as the train passes the 18th station, Monumento, and ascends to the tall\
  \ platforms, shivers ran to my spine and my eyes widened as I feel the ascent. It\
  \ feels like levitating. Yes, I'm aware the view is anything but captivating. But\
  \ I gained more from the last thing I expect on an LRT trip.\n\nThe least can be\
  \ said for MRT-3, the infamous of them all.\n\nFrom LRT's last station, I passed\
  \ two shopping malls to arrive on the first station. And seeing the bustling crowd,\
  \ I think I am getting an early experience of a train ride in Tokyo. It doesn't\
  \ take long from the second station that I had to stand tiptoed. So might as well\
  \ practice ballet before.\n\nDespite that, there are surefire sights to behold like\
  \ the big dome Araneta, two of the gold-draped People Power monuments and lots of\
  \ malls. A lot. But the most notable takeaway is chatting and quipping with fellow\
  \ riders going through the same feat.\n\nNow, give it this, I never expected this\
  \ trip to be fulfilling. The trains need work. But in the meantime, I will sit back\
  \ (if there are seats) and enjoy the view."
