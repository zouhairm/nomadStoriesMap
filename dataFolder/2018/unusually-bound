Text: "He was running around a tyre. A blue towel tied around his neck which made\
  \ it look like a cape. The mountains all looked at him, rising tall around the dreamer.\
  \ There were bells jingling on the flags raising a cacophony. They were tied to\
  \ the edges of prayer flags that formed a net overhead. The sun was just above the\
  \ horizon, casting a bright gold into the atmosphere. It was glorious.\n\nIt was\
  \ my first day in Bhutan and I\u2019d enthusiastically walked a couple of kilometers\
  \ away from our resort. Now, I regretted not carrying water along. There weren\u2019\
  t too many people around and I hence landed up beside a house with a large phallus\
  \ drawn across the wall. That\u2019s every home in Phuentsholing. Supposed to represent\
  \ the local deity, it protects the residents from evil. \n\nHis mother watched over,\
  \ skinning potatoes on the steps of the house. I requested for water, in English.\
  \ I spoke animatedly and I\u2019m sure she understood, but still looked at me quizzically.\
  \ She smiled, went in and got water in a glass. I thanked her and gulped it thirstily\
  \ while she started to rebuke her son who was jumping on and off the tyre now. \u201C\
  Thank you so much\u201D, I said, handing the glass back.\n\n\u201CIndia mein kahan\
  \ se ho aap?\u201D (Where in India do you hail from?), she asked. I was taken aback\
  \ a little. I was quite surprised actually, not expecting the knowledge of, let\
  \ alone fluency in, Hindi in this part of the world. \u201CMumbai\u201D, I said.\
  \ She smiled. \u201CWhere did you learn it from?\u201D we were conversing in near\
  \ perfect Hindi now. \u201CWe all know Hindi around here, learnt it ourselves. We\
  \ watch a lot of Bollywood movies and Hindi serials. My mother loves that character\u2026\
  \u201D she suddenly looked strained. After a few minutes of suggestions ranging\
  \ from Gabbar Singh to Singham, \u201CAnurag!\u201D she blurted out. \u201CThe man\
  \ who came back from the dead a couple of times!\u201D it was from a popular series\
  \ back home. We looked at each other, reminiscing the absolutely ridiculous plot\
  \ and laughed. The kid had forgotten about his game and was gawking at us. We laughed\
  \ for a good couple of minutes, clutching our sides and leaning against the wall.\n\
  \n\u201CJoin us for breakfast with us\u201D, she smiled and beckoned me into the\
  \ house. I was in an unknown land bound to its people by language, emotion and common\
  \ interest. The kid, walked in with a cat and placed it in my lap while an old lady,\
  \ presumably the mother, gave me a toothless grin from across the room.\n\nIt was\
  \ a glorious day indeed."
