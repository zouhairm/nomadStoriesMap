Text: "I sat very still and tried to figure out just how long I was going to be there.\n\
  \nIt was still early morning, but the lilac sky we had arrived to had slowly morphed\
  \ into a quiet golden haze, and the birds had started singing outside. A small slither\
  \ of sunlight found its way through the tiny window, and I\u2019d been watching\
  \ it make its way across the room as the time had passed. \n\nWe sat quietly, altogether\
  \ and yet totally alone, waiting. I looked around, and to my surprise, noticed the\
  \ room was now nearly totally full. There had only been about eight of us when we\
  \ arrived. More people had been slowly arriving and joining behind us, everyone\
  \ giving their offering of incense, cigarettes and flowers to the bowl at the front\
  \ of the room, then making their way to an empty space to sit. And then like the\
  \ rest, silently wait.\n\nThere were all walks of life present in this tiny room\
  \ in Wat Bang Phra, just outside of Bangkok. I could see a Thai girl and her father,\
  \ a Romanian-looking man in cargo shorts, a trio of American men in Ralph Lauren.\
  \ It felt nice, as if we were in a tiny melting pot of the world, and it reminded\
  \ me of just how sought after the practice of Sak Yant was.\n\nSuddenly, there was\
  \ a small surge forward of movement, and I could feel strangers\u2019 hands on my\
  \ shoulders. I looked around in confusion, and saw, with a jump to the heart, that\
  \ the famous monk himself had entered. I did the same, and put my hands on the shoulders\
  \ of the man in front of me, and bowed my head; a web of people was created, spanning\
  \ from the back and reaching the bowl of offerings at the front, which was presented\
  \ with solemnity to the monk as he sat.\n\nMy heart raced as I watched the monk\
  \ calmly gesture to each person to come forward. It was finally beginning. I was\
  \ selfishly itching my seat - what if someone pushed in front of me? What if there\
  \ wasn\u2019t time for us all? But, finally, it was my turn. I nervously moved forward,\
  \ performed my three Wais, and took a breath as I waited. I could feel the eyes\
  \ of the room on me, and I suddenly felt the hot sensation of ink entering flesh;\
  \ I closed my eyes, and breathed. I weirdly thought of my mum, sat at home, who\
  \ would be beside herself if she saw me right now. \n\nTen minutes passed, and I\
  \ was given the tap to go. The sacred tattoo was searing my back, and I trembled\
  \ as I returned. I looked around the room one last time, and my hands ran over my\
  \ new addition. This wouldn\u2019t be the last time I saw it this place.  It couldn\u2019\
  t be. Sorry mum."
