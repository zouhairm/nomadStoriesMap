Text: "When you look at your right, head peeking out of a 7-11 convenience door on\
  \ a silent street in downtown Macau, perched up at the end of a 200-m ascent, there\u2019\
  s a dance club. The kind that doesn\u2019t have any filters.\n\nFinding (or visiting)\
  \ a place like that in Macau isn\u2019t tough. For a city that has always been uncertain\
  \ about its own freedom, Macau is a paradise for free-spirited souls. Being home\
  \ to some of the largest casinos in the world had made Macau a city of dreams for\
  \ many. \n\nWhen I finally entered the place, I realised it wasn't very large. \
  \ \n\nI saw a trail of high heels and colorful hair pass through the room, around\
  \ the high platform with two poles. Roshni was also a part of that trail, but I\
  \ didn\u2019t notice her then. Slowly, the darkness made way as all ladies emerged\
  \ on the floor, wrapped in the haze of colorful lights. By the end of their performance,\
  \ it was all they were wrapped in. \n\nAfter one or two performances, I had gained\
  \ enough courage to shift to one of those uncomfortable, high bar stools that are\
  \ kept very close to the stage where the dances commenced. When Roshni came on the\
  \ floor, she looked just like any other girl there; bold makeup, fake hair, and\
  \ just the bare essential clothing. But as she hugged the pole delicately, and glided\
  \ along it, she instantly stood out. \n\nBecause when I made an eye contact with\
  \ her, she looked at me and gave me a big wide smile (and a flying kiss too!). \n\
  \nIt was my first time in a place like that. I was a shy spectator until that happened.\
  \ Somehow, her smile opened up all the knots inside me, and I cheered her like a\
  \ long-lost friend. By the time she came off the stage, I had decided to turn off\
  \ all my filters and take in everything with affirmation. \n\nThat was when she\
  \ came and kissed me. It was so unexpected that I was sure I was in a dream. Later,\
  \ when she got off the stage, we started talking. \n\nRoshni was from India and\
  \ living in Macau for the past 5 years. She talked about how much she loved this\
  \ place and can never leave. \n\nIn a city which served as a port of refuge in the\
  \ past, she shifted here to find refuge to be whoever she wanted to be. \n\nShe\
  \ had to move on to her next performance, but even then she kept coming back to\
  \ me. All of this left me wondering. Sometimes you need to be uncertain to truly\
  \ find who you are. In places like this, all you need to do is give them someone\
  \ a nice warm smile, and they\u2019ll open their heart to you."
