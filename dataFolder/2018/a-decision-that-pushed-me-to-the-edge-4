Text: "Our car was an old Datsun Bluebird' 89, an inheritance that Philip's grandfather\
  \ left him. The car had its details, but when it started nothing stopped it. That\
  \ summer, we toured southern Chile with the \"Blue Bird\" surfboards included, tents\
  \ and some joints, but above all we carried our desire, our joy. \nIt was a great\
  \ summer, round in every way, we owned the beach, surfed incredible waves, played\
  \ with seals and sea lions. At the end of the summer, we went to our favorite beach,\
  \ bought beer and made a bonfire, waiting to spend the best weekend of the season\
  \ or even our lives. We chatted and went to sleep. The forest welcomed us under\
  \ its green mantle. \nWe woke up to a collective dream, at one point everything\
  \ was chaos, the branches hit our store and the doubt was greater every moment.\
  \ If we did, we were in the middle of an earthquake. We took the right thing and\
  \ went to the old blue bird. After a brief chat we saw a cat running around in fear.\
  \ It was all clear. We flew away in it, in the \"blue bird\". That time it was not\
  \ necessary to push him, nor to give more thought to the key, he left on the first\
  \ attempt, and that night roared. In the moonlight, the borderline between life\
  \ and death, is marked by a furious Blue bird' 89,\"the blue bird\" and a cat, who\
  \ will forever be grateful."
