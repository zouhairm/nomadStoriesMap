Text: "They might say \u2018the city never sleeps\u2019, but in winter, most cities\
  \ hibernate. Biting winds, stinging faces and slush seeping into boots drive all\
  \ but the most adventurous inside.\nNot Montr\xE9al. Montr\xE9al is winter. The\
  \ city moves and breathes it. For nearly a third of the year, there will be snow\
  \ covering the streets.\nI am so sick of snow.\nIt\u2019s a January night. I push\
  \ the door of the club open, and cold washes over me, smooth and painful as diving\
  \ into Antarctic waters. Goosebumps spring up along my arms, shoulders, cleavage,\
  \ even my exposed belly button beneath my crop top. Inhaling, I feel the cold grate\
  \ against my throat, like a deep breath after a peppermint. \nI look out, across\
  \ the city. I\u2019m standing on the roof of a third floor, high enough to see the\
  \ crowds of people milling out of the club, darting across the streets. There are\
  \ so many people here, more people than in my entire country. It\u2019s strange\
  \ that being surrounded by people can make you feel so alone. \nI reach out a hand.\
  \ Catch a snowflake. I look at it; really look at it. In the air they\u2019re just\
  \ white fluff, but melting on my palm, I can see it. The outlines of a post-card,\
  \ picture perfect snowflake. A little icy star. \nI catch another. This flake too\
  \ has a pattern. They all do. And every pattern is different \u2013 every single\
  \ flake is entirely unique. But in the drifts building up against my feet, in the\
  \ blanket covering the cars and the streets below, you could never spot a snowflake.\
  \ Viewed from so far above, there is just snow.\nI look down at the people in the\
  \ street again. A tall woman with long braids is getting in a taxi. Under the glow\
  \ of the streetlights, I can see how red her lipstick is. Outside the club, a boy\
  \ argues fruitlessly with the bouncer. A girl next to him talks on the phone. I\
  \ wonder who she is talking to.\nEvery single person in that wash of a crowd is\
  \ entirely unique, each following their own path, like each snowflake winds its\
  \ own way through the sky. Finding our way alone, yet blending together into something\
  \ vast and confusing and inconvenient and unstoppable.\nThe door behind me opens.\
  \ It\u2019s one of my new friends. \u201CThere you are, we were looking for you!\
  \ Are you ok?\u201D\nI look at my hand again. My fingers are numb, and the snowflakes\
  \ have melted. The pattern is lost \u2013 underneath it all, they\u2019re just drops\
  \ of water.\nI smile. \u201CFor sure \u2013 just needed some air. Let\u2019s get\
  \ another drink.\u201D\nI follow her back inside, and a flurry of snow bats harmlessly\
  \ against the closing door."
