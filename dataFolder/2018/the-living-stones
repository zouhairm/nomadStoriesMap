Text: "Living stones, growing stones doesn\u2019t it sound crazy or maybe unbelievable?\
  \ \nWhen Driver gave us sign we all got down from Bus and made our way to museum\
  \ of Trovants of Costesti. It was open air museum on highway near Costesti, a small\
  \ Romanian village and situated in arms of the mountains & beautiful cliffs. It\
  \ is one of the natural miracles, which was entirely neglected by government, local\
  \ people and tourists. \nWhen I was walking through the yellow sand, I reminisced\
  \ how much struggle I had gone through to reach there. None of the tourist offices\
  \ of Romania or hostels knew about this place and it wasn\u2019t accessible by public\
  \ transport. Believing the information from train station, I took private transport\
  \ but wait, Life is not straight forward journey! After starting journey I realised\
  \ if I leave bus I will stuck in middle of no-where. Being scientist I was so excited\
  \ and curious to visit this stones. I requested everyone in bus if we can stop bus\
  \ at museum for few minutes and visit it. I planned my entire Romania trip to visit\
  \ living stones and luckily people agreed with me. \nYes, Living stones do exist!\
  \ They named as a Trovants, in Romanian geological term it means cemented sand.\
  \ I started reading about it and \u2018The name was introduced by the Romanian naturalist\
  \ Gh. M. Murgoci in his work The Tertiary in Oltenia\u2019. This growing stones\
  \ were genesis of countless myths and stories for years. \nWhen I touched small\
  \ buds I felt journey of each stone \u2026 It seems every stone had different life\
  \ story, diverse shapes and formations. With every rainfall this mysterious journey\
  \ begins. Calcium content of rain water has some magical powers to bring life into\
  \ this stones. The enigmatic \u2018living stones\u2019 spring and form buds after\
  \ coming into contact with water after heavy rainfall. It seems water can bring\
  \ life to stones also not only living organisms. \nTrovants managed to grab attention\
  \ of not only locals but also scientist and geologist worldwide. Scientist found\
  \ that, these enigmatic stones can move from one place to another and more terrifying\
  \ is they can grow & produce small stones. Some stones were divided & I could notice\
  \ different figures and lines like trees maybe showing signs of their age.  When\
  \ I was walking through collection of different stones I felt like visiting living\
  \ family. After visiting Living stones I felt accomplished especially when I lost\
  \ hope to visit it due to many problems. It was last thing I expected and lifetime\
  \ memorable experience."
