Text: "It is stifling, there are no clouds and not even the slightest hint of a breeze\
  \ to alleviate the discomfort and the exhaustion. I am stood on a rocky precipice,\
  \ completely insignificant amongst the towering and imposing peaks of the Annapurna\
  \ Himalayas. \nI look out and down over the valley below, in the direction of my\
  \ final destination. Surely my eyes must be deceiving me; I honestly do not remember\
  \ it being that far on my way up just a few days ago.\nIt has now been 18 days and\
  \ 280 kilometres of almost solitary trekking; I want to rest but I know exactly\
  \ where I am heading; The Chomrong Cottage to see the owner, Didi.\nWhy?\nThat\u2019\
  s an easy answer. \nWho else in these mountains has had their homemade chocolate\
  \ cake featured in Time magazine? \nThe pride emanating from her tired, sun-kissed\
  \ but wonderfully kind face when she first showed me the article has stuck with\
  \ me and I am back to bask in that sweet and gooey glory. \nAll that stands between\
  \ me and my date with a cake filled destiny is a precarious rocky descent of a few\
  \ hundred metres followed by steep ascent to the village opposite.\n\nTo cut this\
  \ short story, erm, short, I am now on the final approach. I can literally smell\
  \ the chocolate in the air.\nThrough sweat stung eyes and in a quite bedraggled\
  \ state I squint up at the promised-land and realise that I have an audience.\n\
  Four female trekkers are watching me through the window and I am clearly the topic\
  \ of conversation. \nFix up, look sharp, I\u2019m no longer hunched over, I am the\
  \ Mountain Man.\n\nI enter the Chomrong Cottage and drop the bag with a resounding\
  \ thud as Didi welcomes me back like a long lost friend and get down to the business\
  \ in hand; \u201CDidi, chocolate cake please\u201D\nIt then gets better as the aforementioned\
  \ trekkers invite me to join them. I\u2019d been used to conversing with the locals\
  \ and even some goats for the past couple of weeks. Result.\n\nThe thing is, I really\
  \ shouldn\u2019t be here, in this place and at this time. \nA whole host of mishaps\
  \ and situations had led me to this exact moment. \nSuch as what you may ask?\n\
  Well, wondering around a village for a day trying to replace what had been stolen\
  \ from my bag on the way over to the region, being laid up for 24 hours with altitude\
  \ sickness  and somehow misreading the map, getting what some would call \u2018\
  lost\u2019 and covering 42 kilometres in a single day.\n\nSo to the point of why\
  \ this was the last thing that I expected?\nOne of those trekkers is now my wife\
  \ and I only wanted was some chocolate cake."
