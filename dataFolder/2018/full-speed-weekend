Text: "Everyone is rushing. And why wouldn\u2019t they, if it\u2019s the Formula 1\
  \ weekend in one of the most glamorous places on earth: Monaco. Just as you arrive\
  \ at Gare de Monaco you can already feel the enthusiasm, the posters tell you it\u2019\
  s a race weekend and the yachts stare at you while they are parked in the deep blue\
  \ ocean. The streets, which are normally filled with luxury cars, are now fenced\
  \ on the sidewalks so to trace the path where the racecars would fly through.\n\n\
  Making my way through the crowds and a red Ferrari, I made it to the Oceanographic\
  \ Museum, where my brother, dressed in the team clothes, was waiting to take me\
  \ to the Formula 2 paddock. The cold of the underground garage where all the F2\
  \ teams where parked was refreshing and provided the perfect cover from the warm\
  \ weather. After saying hello to the new and familiar faces in the team, I got out\
  \ of their way and decided that it was the perfect moment to get a cold beer. I\
  \ decided to do so while walking the track.\n\nThe views of the ocean decorated\
  \ with yachts and cruises were as unbelievable as walking through the marina next\
  \ to the F1 Paddock; where the team trailers competed against one another to see\
  \ which one was bigger and had the best party. In my opinion, Red Bull won without\
  \ a doubt.  On my way back to the oceanographic, I was excited to live my first\
  \ Grand Prix and see first hand how my brother was accomplishing his dream of being\
  \ an F2 engineer. As Friday went and the Saturday race was getting closer, I was\
  \ able to see how everything got prepared, how the car was taken from the paddock\
  \ to the pit and had a front-row view of the race form the Renault pit stop service.\
  \ The sound and the vibration of the cars going by at least at 200 or more km/hr.\
  \ is a feeling that still gives me Goosebumps as I remember it.\n\nThe adrenaline,\
  \ the excitement, and the glamour were more than I was expecting. The team\u2019\
  s equipment was almost packed when the Technical Director walks up to me and asks\
  \ me if I was staying for the big F1 race on Sunday. My plan was to watch it at\
  \ one of the restaurants since my pass only worked for the F2 race and grid. To\
  \ my surprise, they had a VIP pass to the F1 paddock and offered it to me since\
  \ they were all going back home. What was an already an exciting weekend ended up\
  \ being one of the best experiences of my life, walking around celebrities, taking\
  \ pictures with F1 drivers and witnessing how Sebastian Vettel took another win\
  \ over Lewis Hamilton."
