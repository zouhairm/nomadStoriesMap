Text: "\u201CCome see what we found!\u201D\nI had finished putting on my borrowed\
  \ wetsuit (old, funny-smelling) and was treading through the water (cold, funny-smelling)\
  \ to get to the rest of my group. Galapagos, \u201812. My first experiences diving\
  \ in open water and I couldn't be more ecstatic\u2014or anxious. I love the sea,\
  \ but the feeling of not knowing exactly what lies below in the dark is incomparable.\n\
  A school of tiny, transparent fish rushed by as I reached my instructor. Apparently,\
  \ there was something down there that I just had to see.\nI went under and behold,\
  \ a dark cave. Seconds passed and nothing, no starfish or friendly turtle. Just\
  \ as was starting to get out, two white faces appeared and started shaking as if\
  \ to say: \u201CGoing so soon?\u201D Faces eerily similar to some I\u2019d seen\
  \ on the Discovery Channel and not at all like the ones on the fish I\u2019d met\
  \ on the way. Sharks. I frantically backed away to my companions\u2019 laughter.\n\
  A few feet back, I remained unmoving, as one of my new acquaintances exited its\
  \ hiding spot and swam by me. I was extremely aware of my surroundings in a way\
  \ that only seems to occur underwater, where everything moves in slow motion. There\
  \ was the murky water, the bubbles and the loose strands of my hair floating around,\
  \ with my heartbeat as the only soundtrack. First, a pointy face; clear, clear eyes\
  \ with a black slit that seemed to be looking straight at me; smooth skin\u2014\
  if I raised my hand I could feel it\u20141, 2, 3 gills; a thin fin on its side and\
  \ a big, triangular fin on top. Cue the \u2018Jaws\u2019 theme song. Three more\
  \ small fins and a long tail that moved ever so slightly and very gracefully sideways.\n\
  And just like that, the moment was gone.\nI twisted to watch it disappear, just\
  \ in time to see another one show up to my right. New Shark drove ahead and made\
  \ a turn, passed by the rest of my group, diving a few feet beyond, and formed a\
  \ circle around us. Now\u2014that\u2014I was sure I'd seen in the movies, so I went\
  \ to tell my companions about the lurking giants. They were unbothered; Instructor\
  \ Guy jokingly told me these sharks didn't bite people. \u201CYou know why?\u201D\
  \ I shook my head no. \u201CThey\u2019re probably full. And fish definitely taste\
  \ better than us.\u201D I decided to let it go. I was feeling a bit hungry myself.\n\
  But this is why I dive. Because, regardless of how many times you dip underneath\
  \ the waves, you never know what you\u2019ll see. When I came across my sharp-toothed\
  \ friends, we\u2019d been looking for giant lobsters. A different experience each\
  \ time. Sea humor notwithstanding."
