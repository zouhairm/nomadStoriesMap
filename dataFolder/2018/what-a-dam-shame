Text: "Amsterdam, the sin city of Europe, the city that never sleeps and the city\
  \ to experiment. The cobbled roads, alongside the murky waters of the canals, framed\
  \ by the classic Dutch townhouses, hold many secrets. Unfortunately for me it is\
  \ also the city that I lost my phone on the first night of visiting.\nLosing my\
  \ phone meant also losing my camera, my watch, my map, and my method of contact\
  \ with anyone. For someone suffering from social anxiety who uses their phone as\
  \ a shield from any social interaction, it was a catastrophe. In my hotel I found\
  \ a leaflet with a very plain A3 sized map of all the attractions in the city. \
  \ Managing to find Dam square I stopped to take in my surroundings. A couple of\
  \ food benders sat selling hot dogs, along with the funky smell from the coffee\
  \ shops they mixed together giving off a very peculiar scent. A flock of pigeons\
  \ kept getting startled by the crowd in the square and flying up as one, a well-oiled\
  \ machine, and creating quite the spectacle. A man stopped me. He was a tall man,\
  \ well dressed and spoke only a little English. He asked if I could take his picture.\
  \ Feeling a little out of breath and panicky, looking around for escape routes,\
  \ I agreed. After sorting his jacket out for ten minutes, he finally posed for the\
  \ camera, and proceeded to have his own mini photo shoot. There was no doubt that\
  \ he would have a picture that would be Instagram worthy after, and the hilarity\
  \ of it made me forget the panicking that had happened before. I realised this man\
  \ was also wandering the city by himself, and was not at all afraid to speak to\
  \ any other travellers to make the most out of his visit. Once the man had thanked\
  \ me profusely for being his photographer, I moved on. I realised I had been wandering\
  \ the streets of Amsterdam for a few hours, and needed to stop for coffee. Straight\
  \ away the fear was back, would I do something silly? Would the people in there\
  \ be judging me for being by myself? What happens if somebody tried to talk to me\
  \ in a different language? \nTaking a deep breathe I walked into a quaint little\
  \ caf\xE9, with chairs outside under big umbrellas and ordered a \u201Ckoffie\u201D\
  . I found a seat with a good view of the square and realised there was a girl sitting\
  \ by herself two tables along. This was it, amid all the busy tourists, the trams\
  \ clattering past, the coffee machine grinding coffee beans behind us, I managed\
  \ to embrace the freedom and relaxed vibe of Amsterdam, and introduced myself to\
  \ a stranger in a different country."
