Text: "\"I have always loved the anxiousness that traveling makes you feel. It's like\
  \ endless possibilities are out there, just waiting for you to find them...but sometimes\
  \ those possibilities lead you to the most unexpected situation possible\".\n\n\n\
  -So you don't want to hang around with us?- I asked our kidnappers as they left\
  \ without sparring us a last look while we were hanging, tied by our wrists.\n\n\
  -Do you really think this is the right time to be making puns, Victoria?- I heard\
  \ Thomas mutter with annoyance by my side.\n\n-Why are you angry now? We wouldn\xB4\
  t be here if you hadn't tried to impress that girl by spilling the beans about the\
  \ robbed jade.\n\n-How was I supposed to know that she worked for a mafia that has\
  \ been robbing all around America? \n\n-Geez, I don't know...maybe if someone had\
  \ warned you about it.- I said with a sarcastic tone- Oh, wait. I DID warn you about\
  \ her. \n\n-Okay, I get it. Now, can we please think of a way to get out?- He asked\
  \ looking around, trying to find something to help us escape.\n\n\n\nDear reader,\
  \ you are probably wondering how we got into this situation, or maybe you don't\
  \ care at all, either way I'm going to explain how this adventure began:\n\nI meet\
  \ Thomas one week before getting kidnaped. We were on the same tv program, but while\
  \ I was in charge of writting the scrips, he was a cameraman. Later on I would discover\
  \ that neither of us liked our job. He aspired to be a photographer; I always dreamed\
  \ of becoming a travel writer. But there we were: On a plane, getting ready to film\
  \ a program about the traditions and landscapes of Argentina.\n\n\n\n20 hours later\
  \ we finally landed, and Thomas decided to start getting on my nerves.\n\n-\"I have\
  \ always loved the anxiousness that traveling makes you feel. It's like endless\
  \ possibilities are out there, just waiting for you to find them...\"- I heard Thomas\
  \ reading, recognizing the words immidiately.\n\n-It's really rude to grab other\
  \ people's belongings.- I snapped my notebook from his hands, as I checked out from\
  \ the plane and went to the nearest phone cab to call a taxi.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Thomas\
  \ found a way to ruin the rest of our trip: He bumped into a group of people, messed\
  \ up with the luggages and swap his with a different one. We wouldn't discover this\
  \ until, 2 hours later in our hotel, we opened our luggages and found out that one\
  \ of them instead of clothes had a really expensive-looking jade that was surrounded\
  \ by piles of dollars.\n\nAnd that was just the beggining of our unimaginable adventure."
