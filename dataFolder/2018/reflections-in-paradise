Text: "Most of us have dreamt of breaking free of our familiar routines and surroundings\
  \ for a more exotic life in a land far away. Following a difficult year in which\
  \ I lost my dad to cancer and my 7-year relationship came to an end, I became sceptical\
  \ and questioning of my purpose in London. I made the decision to quit my job and\
  \ find solace in South East Asia. It felt like the perfect remedy. I immediately\
  \ embodied a new sense of courage and freedom and without the retraints of working,\
  \ commuting, paying rent and everything else that clouds our perspective and our\
  \ imagination, I was able to focus solely on making myself happy again. Waking up\
  \ every morning to an open map, when the only decision you have to make is which\
  \ part of the world to explore, is undoubtedly blissful. I travelled from the peaks\
  \ of HK to the mystical waters of Halong Bay; down the spine of beautiful War-torn\
  \ Vietnam into Cambodia; over to the peaceful north of Thailand, through Malaysia\
  \ and finally into Indonesia where I experienced the very best and very worst days\
  \ of my trip. Sometimes taking a few days to indulge in having nothing to do, sometimes\
  \ hectic with cramming too much in, but always learning about the history and culture\
  \ of the place, and more poignantly, about myself. After spending a few weeks over\
  \ Christmas with two more of my closest friends from home who had come to visit,\
  \ I started to feel stifled, which I now realise was a symptom of spending a lot\
  \ of time travelling selfishly. It seemed empowering to abruptly make the decision\
  \ to leave them. Looking back I had become a little unconcerned about how my new\
  \ sense of independence could impact those closest to me. Shortly after, I started\
  \ to become ill with a blood infection, and wasn\u2019t able leave the hostel, I\
  \ was on the Gili Islands, completely remote and without a hospital. Snorkelling\
  \ with turtles in the perfect turquoise waters that surrounded me had been one of\
  \ the most magical moments of my life days before, but now I was isolated, the paradise\
  \ outside dissolved away. Suddenly it was all irrelevant and I was desperate for\
  \ the home comforts and people that I had quite recklessly left behind. I would\
  \ urge everyone to grasp every opportunity to travel, but travel with compassion\
  \ for those who don\u2019t want to, or aren\u2019t able to. Discover new places\
  \ and relationships, but always be full of love for those who are waiting for you.\
  \ Be liberated and spend time alone, but be endlessly grateful that you have the\
  \ option to do so."
