Text: "When they told me I would be traveling for work to a few countries where we\
  \ had manufacturing plants, the last thing I thought I would get to do was spend\
  \ a few days in Paris in between work weeks. I had no plan for it, very little I\
  \ could comfortably say in French and determination to see as much as I could. \
  \ I would never have believed all I was able to see and experience if I hadn't done\
  \ it myself. Those activities ranged from touring the car showrooms along the Champs\
  \ Elysees to checking out ivory teeth in a skull grinning below the Paris streets\
  \ to riding the great Ferris wheel over the space needle to see that beautiful triangle\
  \ with the arc de triumph on view..\n\nMy favorite thing to do in a new city is\
  \ to get just a bit lost- this is how you stumble upon the best kept secrets, whether\
  \ this is the local shop with absolutely amazing food or a store get sculpture in\
  \ one of the city's corners. In Paris, having ambled away from Notre Dame, I stumbled\
  \ upon a French open air market. Organized like a garage sale that has gotten out\
  \ of hand and taken over, this was a truly unique experience. \n\nFrom the savory\
  \ to the truly odd, full fox fur coats draped around portions of velveteen theater\
  \ seats and as a solo traveler I was able to fully blend in as a Parisian. I wandered\
  \ from stall to stall, looking at each cheerful piece of bric-a-brac as I went along.\
  \ In one of the more piecemeal locations- tribal type vases sat next to Wedgwood\
  \ inspired decor I was able to strike up a conversation with a petite elderly woman\
  \ digging into her lunchtime meal, consisting of a fresh baguette some orange Jam\
  \ and a type of French biscuit I couldn't identify. \n\nA myriad of smells and colors\
  \ of food from different stalls wafted around the market but I wouldn't have been\
  \ able to experience the best food I had in Paris without the friendly conversation.\
  \ She was able to point me towards a hidden bakery where I had the lightes croissant\
  \ of my life- a confection of butter and air.\n\nSuccessful travel always involves\
  \ the connections you make and where they may lead you next."
