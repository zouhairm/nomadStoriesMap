Text: "I had been living as an au pair to a 9-year-old girl named Sabela in a small\
  \ fishing village along the Atlantic coast of Spain for five weeks now. The month\
  \ was April; tropical trees around me dripped with rainwater and fog lingered within\
  \ the streets and along beaches of the sleepy town of Portonovo. The town slept\
  \ these spring mornings away and their days were full of drinking caf\xE9 con leche\
  \ with baked goods in the caf\xE9s along the seaside boardwalk. \n\nIn the mornings,\
  \ I\u2019d walk Sabela to her school bus station, waiting there with the other guardians\
  \ who were sometimes other nannies but most times mothers and grandmothers seeing\
  \ their children off for the day. After seeing off Sabela that morning, I had been\
  \ ready to explore the viewpoint Sabela and her parents had taken me on my first\
  \ full day in Spain. \n\nIn my Nike running shoes, I started the hike towards the\
  \ ridge that I remember so fondly. Passing through farms, orange roof topped houses\
  \ and under bridges where the fog circulated through. The ground became more dampened\
  \ by the rainfall the night before. Once I had reached the top, I took a deep breath\
  \ in, breathing the smell of wet grass and hearing the waves beneath me crash against\
  \ the shore. \n\nFor a little while longer I embraced being healthy and alive in\
  \ a place so beautiful, and then I made my way back down to the streets. So happy\
  \ in my surroundings, I bounced down the hill, forgetting how slippery it had become\
  \ from the rain, I took another leap, and when I landed, I heard my ankle snap ad\
  \ before I knew it I was on the ground. \n\nMy tears from the pain falling along\
  \ my cheek began mixing with the rain that started to fall from the sky. I cried\
  \ and yelled in utter agony for twenty minutes as I sunk into the muddy ground.\
  \ No one heard me. I was alone. Once I gave myself time to be in shock of what had\
  \ happened I gathered myself and began making my way down the pathway now with a\
  \ steady stream of rainwater tumbling down just as I was.\n\nOnce I had made it\
  \ to sea level, I stumbled against an unstable, rickety fence that blew around in\
  \ the storm I was caught in. A woman from the house across from me came down with\
  \ an umbrella and started talking to me in Spanish. As I didn't understand her,\
  \ I pointed at my bruised swollen ankle while in tears and thought to myself how\
  \ much I wish I had learned Spanish.\n\nThen something happened, the woman grabbed\
  \ my hands and held them in hers saying in an accented choppy English, \"It's ok.\
  \ You'll be ok\""
