Text: "Travelling by local transport is a great way to get an understanding of a country.\
  \ After reading about the picturesque Vietnamese landscape, the excitement of travelling\
  \ by train was high.\n\nI thanked my taxi driver and walked towards Nha Trang railway\
  \ station, quaint and calm unlike the bustling stations of India that I was used\
  \ to. To my surprise everyone was patiently seated in a waiting room, the guard\
  \ told us she would open the gate to the platform when the train arrives. \n\nI\
  \ kept my backpack and looked at the television screen for information but it was\
  \ in Vietnamese. While I got busy checking my instagram feed my friend was talking\
  \ to the lady at the ticket counter. As he walked towards me I could sense something\
  \ was wrong.\n\n\u201CHey, our train has been cancelled\u201D, our eyes met in silence,\
  \ \u201Cbut we could either get the full reimbursement or take the next available\
  \ train, in five hours\u201D. Unlike my usual self I didn't go into a frenzy. Considering\
  \ we had no other place to sleep, we agreed to exchange the tickets.\n\n\u201CThis\
  \ is your honour money and your seats have been upgraded, please sign on the receipt\
  \ here\u201D the lady at the counter said, handing out our new ticket and 40,000\
  \ dongs. Perplexed my friend and I looked at each other. The situation had suddenly\
  \ turned from disastrous to delightment. \n\nThe train arrived on time at 3:10 am.\
  \ I settled in my berth and took a sigh of relief, unaware my journey was about\
  \ to get a little more adventurous. \n\nShortly the train attendant greeted us,\
  \ and with great emphasis tried to explain something in Vietnamese pointing towards\
  \ our ticket. By now I had no more patience, frustrated with the language issue\
  \ he left.\n\nAfter few minutes he came back with his iPhone, using Google Translate\
  \ to play out the message. \u2018This train will go only up to Ninh Hoa, then you\
  \ need to board a bus till Tuy Hoa, from there another train will take you to Da\
  \ Nang.\u2019 We had underestimated what the recent typhoon had done, destroying\
  \ portions of the tracks. Too tired to process the information I retired.\n\nThe\
  \ attendant woke us up, half asleep, we stepped down in chaos. Other passengers\
  \ also seemed dazed and confused, in that moment it felt a bit comforting.\n\nI\
  \ leaned on the bus window, watching the dawn break. The sight of headless coconut\
  \ trees and broken branches made clear the typhoon was a strong one. Thinking back\
  \ it reminds me how efficiently the locals handled that crisis and of course made\
  \ my travel in Vietnam unexpectedly more profound."
