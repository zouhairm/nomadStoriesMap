Text: "Growing up in the U. S. there are narratives about different countries that\
  \ you hear, at least offhandedly. We all know about the third world countries. Very\
  \ often, the images we see of these places are from infomercials and child sponsorship\
  \ ads. Many first world citizens may simply see these images, store them away as\
  \ necessary but remote knowledge, and then move on. \n\nIn the fall of 2016 I traveled\
  \ to Kenya as part of a mission trip with members of my church. Our purpose was\
  \ to come alongside established churches in remote areas of Kenya and help them\
  \ tell their neighbors about Jesus Christ and how he came to save sinners. Being\
  \ from the States, you may already be able to guess what I expected to find on arriving\
  \ in Kenya. And for many of my expectations, I was right.\n \nWe flew into Nairobi\
  \ and then farther south to Mombasa. Next was another hour drive to our hotel just\
  \ off the Indian Ocean, more remote and less developed than the cities we were in\
  \ earlier that day. After a night of rest, our group divided into three and each\
  \ subgroup drove 20 minutes to an hour further to meet our respective churches.\
  \ Here was the Africa I had heard about. \n\nWe spent five days walking around villages\
  \ and meeting Kenyans, telling them about Christ and inviting them to church. We\
  \ also got to know our brothers and sisters from the Kenyan churches, men and women\
  \ happy to welcome us, feed us, and worship with us. \n\nI did see plenty of \u201C\
  third world\u201D living during my time in Kenya. The disparity between their lives\
  \ and my life in the States is vast. Yet as I said, this was expected. What I did\
  \ not expect was the hospitality we were shown at every turn. Despite circumstances,\
  \ these people offered us food and friendship without hesitation. We learned that\
  \ Kenyans are known for being welcoming and treating guests with great honor. That\u2019\
  s not something you always see in developed countries, where privacy and safety\
  \ can be higher priorities. \n\nThere\u2019s a Swahili proverb that says, \u201C\
  To get a guest is a great blessing.\u201D In contrast, Ben Franklin once said house\
  \ guests and fish both start to smell after three days. What would it be like if\
  \ more people, more nations were known for their hospitality like Kenyans? Even\
  \ amidst discomfort, let\u2019s welcome friends and strangers as blessings rather\
  \ than smelly fish \u2013 it\u2019ll make the trip better for all of us!"
