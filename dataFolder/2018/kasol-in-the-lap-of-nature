Text: "It was a sunny day, my friend called me in the afternoon that we will be leaving\
  \ in the evening for \u2018somewhere\u2019. We sat in the car and thats when we\
  \ started to discuss where we should be heading to. I suggested Jaisalmer but the\
  \ rest of the group wanted to see snow, Kasol was finalized and in the night we\
  \ left. It was four of us and our ride was a strong and sturdy yet elegant Toyota\
  \ Fortuner. To give you some information, Kasol is a small village in the state\
  \ of Himachal Pradesh located in the northern part of India. It is located in Parvati\
  \ valley, on the banks of Parvati river and is quite a scenic place. At a distance\
  \ of approximately 530 Kms (326 miles) from Delhi, a drive to Kasol can usually\
  \ take around 11-12 hours. When we reached to Kasol looking for snow but there wasn\u2019\
  t any sign of the same. I enquired a local and he advised that if it continues to\
  \ rain like this then it will surely snow, the decreasing temperature which will\
  \ go below zero degrees will add to it the night was difficult to manage as in-spite\
  \ of two blankets and layers of clothes I was still feeling cold during the night.\
  \ In the morning when we woke up, we got to know that it had snowed in Tosh. Tosh\
  \ is further up Kasol and usually gets snowfall during such weather conditions.\
  \ Since we had come this far a \u2018few\u2019 kilometers to see the snow were negligible\
  \ and we decided to drive till Tosh.Kasol had become a heaven to me because of its\
  \ nature, peaceful surroundings with all the lovely hearted and kind people of the\
  \ himalayas.It was an unforgiving experience with my friends beside,\n  We made\
  \ the decision to go through the road for the right side.The trip to the himalayas\
  \ just relaxed my mind with its beauty all around it was just like a paradise to\
  \ me an experience of a lifetime with many ups and downs , treks, camping,hiking,born\
  \ fire,and many more.As per my experience one should plan a trip to the beautifull\
  \ himalayas of a lifetime experience.Words still cant express my feelings and my\
  \ travel to the himalayas it was breathtaking and magical."
