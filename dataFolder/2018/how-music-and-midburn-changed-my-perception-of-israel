Text: "The American media has a confusing way of depicting the world. Between the\
  \ inundation of celebrity gossip and political snafus, a filtered picture began\
  \ to form in my mind. Though I prided myself in avoiding frivolous and biased news,\
  \ it was not until I was offered a press assignment to cover Midburn\u2014Israel's\
  \ regional Burning Man\u2014that I realized how little I knew about modern Israeli\
  \ culture. As honored as I was by this opportunity, the media rigmarole that had\
  \ sat quietly in my subconscious began to awaken. Thoughts of Gaza, terrorism, and\
  \ religious zealots flickered through my mind like a stock ticker. The idea of a\
  \ Burning Man community existing there never occurred to me and I quickly understood\
  \ that, as a music and culture journalist, this trip was mandatory.\n\nUpon arrival,\
  \ I visited an artist collective in Tel Aviv where I drank cardamom-spiced coffee\
  \ and fraternized with icons of the city's underground music scene. Though I was\
  \ alight with inspiration, like many stories, this one is not without peril. That\
  \ night, while enjoying beer and hummus with some locals at a restaurant by Tel\
  \ Aviv's Sarona Market, two Palestinian men opened fire, killing four and wounding\
  \ six. Possessed by that intoxicating cocktail of fear and curiosity, I caught a\
  \ glimpse of a gunman flash by just before being apprehended. My preconceived fears\
  \ were confirmed on my first day.\n\nI left that harrowing night behind for the\
  \ golden sands of the Negev Desert. Becoming more immersed in the stunning landscape,\
  \ welcoming people and vibrant culture, the attack felt like the remnants of a fading\
  \ nightmare. Sinuous dirt roads led to towering, wooden effigies that pierced the\
  \ horizon as Midburn mystically appeared like Brigadoon. It was in this mirage that\
  \ I witnessed an indelible moment. Two men donning thongs and tutus, danced side\
  \ by side\u2014one holding an Israeli flag, the other, a Palestinian flag. In a\
  \ country still wounded by conflict, was two half-naked men from opposite sides\
  \ of the wall dancing together on the same desert floor that Moses once gazed upon.\
  \ Midburn was a microcosm that allowed the freaks and weirdos to shake their sacral\
  \ chakras sans judgment. As is the intention of countercultural gatherings, it provided\
  \ a place for outcasts to feel at home. I came to Israel with the intention of smiting\
  \ my preconceived notions and despite how my trip began, I left doing just that\u2014\
  though I didn't expect it to be because of two men wearing thongs and tutus."
