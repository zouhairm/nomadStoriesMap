Text: "\u201C\xBF****** ni\xF1os son ******* Estados Unidos?\u201D the school administrator,\
  \ Alejandra*, asks me. \u201CAre the kids\u2014something\u2014United States?\u201D\
  \ Ale* is an intimidating 40-some Spanish woman with a salt-and-pepper pixie cut\
  \ who rapid-fire mumbles so fast that I rarely hear anything other than syllables.\
  \ \n\n\u201C\xBFComo?\u201D I ask.\n\n\u201C\xBF****** ni\xF1os son ******* Estados\
  \ Unidos?\u201D she says again. Good lord.  \n\n\u201CUhh, pues,\u201D I say while\
  \ feverishly fishing for something I can say to salvage the conversation. \n\nShe\
  \ then gives me a look, the look, actually. The look is a mix of pity, impatience,\
  \ and confusion, and I\u2019ve been on the receiving end of it at least once a day\
  \ for the past year and a half here in Madrid. It says, \u201CYou poor idiot. You\
  \ aren\u2019t very good at this.\u201D \n\nThe last thing I expected when I moved\
  \ to Spain was just how bad I would be at Spanish. Ever since I could remember,\
  \ I\u2019ve always wanted to learn other languages. It was like learning a secret\
  \ language with your friends except this language wasn\u2019t secret at all but\
  \ spoken by millions of people around the world. I studied hard throughout school.\
  \ I won an award for excellency in Spanish from my high school, got a four out of\
  \ five on the AP exam, and continued studying in university. At 26, I had finally\
  \ decided to really give it a whirl. \n\nBut any romantic ideas I had about living\
  \ abroad were pulverized by the look. It made my organs shake like jello. It made\
  \ the temperature of my face rival that of the surface of the sun. \n\nA year passed\
  \ and nothing changed. Ale's casual attempts at conversation with me continue to\
  \ go about as well as a human trying to communicate with a caterpillar. \n\nThen,\
  \ one day, I was hovering awkwardly by the printer in her office. I was in her way,\
  \ and I heard her mumble, \u201C\xBFPero, que haces esa chica aqu\xED?\u201D (or,\
  \ \u201CBut, what is this girl doing here?\u201D)\n\nI glanced over at her, trying\
  \ to meet her eyes, but she avoided them. Did she really just say that in front\
  \ of my face? \n\nBut then I realized. I had understood her! Even when she was mumbling!\
  \ So quietly! Under her breath! I had understood the unintelligible! The impossible!\
  \ \n\nI had never been so happy in my life to understand someone complaining about\
  \ me in front of my face. I wanted to smile ear-to-ear, but I also didn\u2019t want\
  \ to look like an even bigger idiot than I already did. It was the most basic sentence,\
  \ of course, but, regardless, after all this time feeling like an idiot in the dark,\
  \ I felt euphoric to be an idiot that understood."
