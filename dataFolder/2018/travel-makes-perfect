Text: "It was 9 o\u2019clock. I saw one little boy with his rucksack slung over his\
  \ shoulder. It was my first days in India. This brief encounter, his carefree spirit,\
  \ completely changed my outlook that day and set the tone for many more wonderful\
  \ adventures to follow. Therefore before coming to India, I was said that India\
  \ is fictional country, but I didn\u2019t believe it. Once I saw it with my own\
  \ eyes, I was impressed. Especially when I visited the Taj Mahal, it was really\
  \ unbelievable. \n  India has changed me totally. I\u2019ve returned to a local.\
  \ The way people live their life, dress, eat their food and whatever they do considerably\
  \ influenced me. Now I\u2019m a local. I eat a lot. I eat even like they do only.\
  \ I used to eat each kind of food with spoon, now I don\u2019t need spoon. From\
  \ the beginning I could not eat spicy food, it was very difficult for me. When I\
  \ was outside I could hardly manage it. I spent a lot of days to be hungry. Then\
  \ one day I was far from my house, it was 3 pm. I was very hungry, then forcefully\
  \ I went to the food court to have lunch. I ordered him to make zero spicy food.\
  \ When he brought the food, I tried to taste it, it was like pepper spicy. I immediately\
  \ asked water. There was no more choice, I had to eat it. I started to eat, again\
  \ I drank water, I started sweating, reddening, the girls next to me were looking\
  \ at me and laughing by seeing my red and sweating face. I was very embarrassed\
  \ and lost, then it created a power for me, I ate all though it was spicy. I paid\
  \ and rushed off. Therefore the community and atmosphere hugely influenced me. India\
  \ is a place where the smile is free. It is a land of smiles. Whoever you see they\
  \ smile at you. You can easily interact and make friendship. Every meter of my visit\
  \ is different, every experience is unique. Each day you step outside is an adventure.What\
  \ mostly surprised me is there is no country which encapsulates diversity so perfectly.\
  \ We are distanced by nothing. Not language, caste, creed or regionalism. I visited\
  \ most part of India, so whenever I went, I could find a family and a home. They\
  \ are very hospitable and kind to you. They love to share about their thoughts and\
  \ feeling to you. \n    In conclusion, I would like to state that I always love\
  \ to travel to different edge of the world in order to get known different place\
  \ and to get new experience and new things. To travel is to know the world. Every\
  \ destination opens my eyes to new experiences. \nThanks and Best regards, \nSurush"
