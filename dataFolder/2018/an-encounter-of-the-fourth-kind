Text: "The insoluble salt felt odd in my mouth, it was something unexpected from a\
  \ buttered toast.\n\u2018Why would you order coffee in a country that is so famous\
  \ for having this unique tea?\u2019 \u2019I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m just a traditional\
  \ man\u2019 \u2018Well, tradition here is the tea ceremony, you know?\u2019 My boyfriend\
  \ rolled his eyes in reply.\nThe old waitress, who spoke unintelligible words, blended\
  \ in with the dark brown walls \u2013which matched the floor-, the squeaky chairs\
  \ and the 50s Elvis music \u2013you know, \u201CLove Me\u201D and so. She kept talking\
  \ while contorting her body until she was sure we understood we were so much welcomed\
  \ to her caf\xE9, took our order and left. Ayumi was preparing breakfast while looking\
  \ at us. A friend once told me that Japanese people were pretty hospitable, especially\
  \ with tourists. And we were definitely tourists. So I think Ayumi just wanted to\
  \ be sure that we were well attended to. I have to admit, I was uncomfortable with\
  \ the idea of a 50s lady ready to unleash her desperate need to serve us in that\
  \ little shop. I swear she was ready to jump in at any minute. It didn\u2019t seem\
  \ right for my occidental mind. Immediately, I remembered the lady who stood up\
  \ and offered us her seat to us on the bus the day before that. After a friendly\
  \ fight, she took her seat again and kept smiling at us all the way to one of the\
  \ temples we visited in Japan.\n\u2018This place is really nice\u2019 \u2018Yeah,\
  \ I feel like I\u2019m in my granny\u2019s house\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s nothing like\
  \ those food chains\u2019\nAnd it was really nothing like that. We were in that\
  \ time capsule for like an hour discussing on the ways Japanese people create the\
  \ plastic food that is displayed at every restaurant window.\nWhen you go to McDonald\u2019\
  s you see the picture and you feel that hamburger is all you need. Until you unwrap\
  \ it and the sad reality of the happy clown punches you in the face. It was nothing\
  \ like it. The toast I saw through that edgy window was my toast.\nDuring all the\
  \ time we stayed at the coffee shop, Ayumi paid attention to all of our movements\
  \ while talking to two elderly clients that were drinking tea. They seemed pretty\
  \ close; maybe it was because of the age they shared and the fact that they shared\
  \ history too. Maybe they were neighbors. God only knows. Or maybe they just saw\
  \ us the way we saw them. And in that moment maybe they were talking about where\
  \ we were from or why we kept looking at them, and wondering what we were doing\
  \ at that coffee shop that has been left behind on a little corner of Osaka."
