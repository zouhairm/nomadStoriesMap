Text: '"If you really insist,I will lend you bikes. but i warn you that tomorrow it
  won''t be a good day for riding, meteorological  department already stated that
  there is a high chance of rain and the most of the road will be muddy because of
  rain and the stones and pebbles will make your riding more difficult"

  Bike rental agent paused for our reply

  We looked each other and asked do we came this much distance from that side of this
  large nation to simply give up our dream of riding through himalayas because of
  rain.

  No,it''s more than 3000 kilometres, surely it''s no small distance

  Next day morning,we geared up and took the bike from shop early morning itself and
  roamed around manali,after filling the tanks we,me and my 5 friends begun the journey
  to keylong which comes after the himalayan mountain range.

  As expected rain started to pour with us,but the excitement and enthusiasm were
  not extinguished.

  Along with the heavy trucks and cars got stuck in the number rohtang pass hairpin
  bends we climbed to the top of rohtang,it was mesmerizing view for the eyes with
  the showers,and the taste of momos kept our mind warm for the distance and the taste
  buds craving for more,military trucks and soldiers we met in the way gave glance
  to us how much our soldiers are struggling for the nation in this mountain range
  with low temperature climate, even though border road organisation was doing their
  best in many places the road were broken and very difficult to drive on because
  of rain and soil erosion ,evening we reached keylong safely and decided to comeback
  next day by staying there that night.

  The problems started next day was a fine morning with shining sun and no rain ,but
  broke bikes key while opening petrol tank,we got stuck in  the middle of lahaul
  -spiti road,while trying to start it by fusing we messed up with the battery also
  so we had to load it onto truck and go 15km away keylong town to get repaired that
  too in a place where getting only bsnl network that too only sometimes,so we had
  to stay there for another night but not till dawn which could make us miss our flight
  from delhi the next day morning,so we woke up on 3 o''clock and rode back to manali
  in shivering cold there were no other bikers but when we reached the top of rohtang
  in dawn and we enjoyed the beautiful scenario which no other bikers could have experienced.

  And I believe taking the risks,living up to the adventures takes you to the new
  places,gives you special moments to cherish in the future'
