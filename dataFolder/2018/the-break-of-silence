Text: "One day I decided to spend a whole month in Dublin in a guest house. Before\
  \ staying in that 16-bed place in the city center for nearly five weeks, I thought\
  \ I wanted to become an observer. Silence would be the ultimate weapon. It certainly\
  \ was. I barely had money so, in part, I took advantage of the 1-euro breakfast\
  \ to pick as much as I needed to survive during the day: two boiled eggs, cheese\
  \ and some bread slices. That would be all to observe the city. What a city. I did\
  \ not have a raincoat or even a bag to carry my notebook and my wallet. I used a\
  \ cloth bag as a school bag. People from all over the world went in and out of the\
  \ house, which was quite entertaining to observe from a foreign, silent perspective.\
  \ Some of them, even in muteness, were like my close friends. I knew them better\
  \ than their actual friends, probably. I discovered, by means of observation, what\
  \ they liked to read in solitude, which pyjamas they wore, their face with no worries.\
  \ Them being pure, sort of. Some kind of connection made new tourists invite me\
  \ for dinner there in the hotel. \u201CMake yourself at home\u201D, they suggested.\
  \ Home is connected to warmth, it seems. I took a whiskey bottle as a gift. Maybe\
  \ the break in the use of silence prompted me to misconceive them. That bottle was\
  \ too much. Too much kept in my cloth bag. Although it was clarified later, I had\
  \ misunderstood their welcome, it was too late. Not only the silence was broken,\
  \ also the energy. So silence was freed and now just noise was allowed. The house\
  \ started being too rowdy. Too much. 14 days there and it seems it was too much\
  \ for me then. It was 4am and I was unable to sleep. I went downstairs. There was\
  \ a party. But also a Dubliner. There. Unexpected. He started talking to me while\
  \ I was half daydreaming-half agonised. He started talking about some weird stuff\
  \ about Dublin, about the atmosphere. Something I couldn\u2019t be able to get elsewhere.\
  \ I don\u2019t know if intoxication helped the situation create such a feel. But\
  \ then I knew that was exactly what I was looking for. In a way. That very night,\
  \ I needed to renew my stay there. But, why then? That was all I needed. Now the\
  \ break of silence had a new meaning. And it was not noisy. It was clarifying, full\
  \ of revelation. Why was there that guy in that very room? Have I written down everything\
  \ he had said? Too many mysteries surrounded by the control of silence. In the middle\
  \ of that bedlam, it was obvious it was happily time to go home. If you know what\
  \ I mean by that."
