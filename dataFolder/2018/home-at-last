Text: "\u201CWelcome to Petra\u201D, the taxi driver announced after four hours of\
  \ driving through the unpaved trails of utter nothingness. My mind recounted the\
  \ series of unfortunate decisions that placed me in this situation. I was exhausted\
  \ and had paid all my money to the driver. Worst of all, I was not even sure where\
  \ I were. \nAs I stepped out of the car, I was faced with endless piles of blood-colored\
  \ sands and a stream of tourists all strolling towards the same direction. With\
  \ uncertainty, I followed the pact and waddled my way through a descending passage\
  \ with nothing but a backpack. The beautiful rocky walls enclosing the way seemed\
  \ as if they were caving in at times. As the passage began to get narrower, I struggled\
  \ to cram myself amongst the growing crowds of tourists. In the midst of my frustration,\
  \ I tripped with a tiny stone and scratched my knee. I looked up to find an arm\
  \ reaching for me to help me stand up again. It was an elderly man, seemingly a\
  \ local whose striking tan caused by the harsh sunrays distinguished him from the\
  \ rest. \u201Cstai bene?\u201D, he hesitantly mumbled. I smiled and replied positively\
  \ in fluent Arabic. His face lit up, he introduced himself as \u201CHaj Yousef\u201D\
  \ and proceeded to conversate with me in Arabic. \nThe man told me that he was born\
  \ in the city and had been living there ever since. \u201CI worked as a tour guide\
  \ for 40 years, I know every turn\u2019, he explained with pride shown on his face.\
  \ With a sense of embarrassment, I explained to him that I was -in fact- Jordanian\
  \ but have never visited my hometown before. I was a stranger in my own country.\
  \ Even worse, I have made no effort to reconnect with the culture. To my incredulity,\
  \ Haj was far more understanding than I expected, and our conversation continued.\
  \ \nHaj then offered to guide me to Al Khazneh- the hidden gem of the desert. At\
  \ that point, I realized that I have spent an hour walking into the riddled trails\
  \ of Petra. My refreshing encounter with Haj scrubbed my exhaustion off. He was\
  \ not only an exceptional conversationalist, but also a wonderful story-teller.\
  \ His vivid recollections of the city were described with passion and drew me to\
  \ the place. For the first time in my life, I felt a sense of belonging to a place.\
  \ \nLight shone through what seemed like the gates to eternity. Haj and I slowly\
  \ descended towards the light and before my eyes unveiled the most staggering scene.\
  \ A massive ancient structure, carved into the raveling sandstone waiting to be\
  \ discovered. At last, I was home."
