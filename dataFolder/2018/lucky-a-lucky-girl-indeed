Text: "I never expected a stray dog to create a long-term relationship with a Mexican\
  \ veterinarian but I have a new furry friend and Mexican friend now as a result\
  \ of my travels through Petatlan, Mexico in 2016.\n\nThe medium sized dirty white\
  \ dog lay beside the busy lane of traffic whimpering, but no one bothered to help\
  \ her. The car that hit her didn\u2019t even slow down afterward and was now long\
  \ gone. As a dog lover, I could not just ignore her cries of pain.\n\nI approached\
  \ her with a calm voice and assessed her injuries. It appeared she had only a broken\
  \ leg. No one else approached or offered to help.\nIt was my first day visiting\
  \ the village of Petatlan, Mexico. I didn\u2019t know my way around and my Spanish\
  \ was limited.\n\nI finally found someone willing to give me directions to a nearby\
  \ veterinary clinic. I gently wrapped her in my jacket and carried her to the clinic.\
  \ The vet confirmed she had a broken leg but said without a home she wouldn\u2019\
  t survive \u2013 the streets are only for the fittest. There are many street dogs\
  \ in Petatlan. They survive on scraps and garbage. She\u2019ll die within a week\
  \ or she can be euthanized now.\n\nI offered to adopt her. I could see she was a\
  \ gentle dog who just needed a chance at a good life. The vet advised against it\
  \ but I couldn\u2019t be persuaded to just leave her. In my opinion, all dogs deserve\
  \ a good home.\n\nHe treated her leg and provided directions for care. He also gave\
  \ her the basic vaccinations since her history was unknown and to travel she needed\
  \ them. I paid him, only $50 (USD), and took her back to my hotel (luckily dog-friendly).\n\
  \nTo my surprise, the vet called two days later to check on her. I told him she\
  \ was doing great and that we were headed back to Queretaro the next day.\nTwo weeks\
  \ later I received another call from the vet, just checking on her. \u201CI wish\
  \ we had more people like you here. The people who saw you rescue her have also\
  \ commented on your braveness to get involved in a strange city with a strange dog.\
  \ They are impressed. They ask about Lucky, the name they have given her.\u201D\n\
  \nI\u2019m still in contact with the vet and send him pictures periodically. The\
  \ local people have started a small shelter to find homes for several of the street\
  \ dogs. When Lucky and I return to the area next week, we will visit the vet and\
  \ the shelter.\n\nI never expected to adopt another dog, especially a street dog\
  \ from Petatlan, but she has become a constant companion and great topic of conversation."
