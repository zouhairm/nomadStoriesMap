Text: "Imagine for a moment the scent of mint; the slightly sweet yet almost tangy\
  \ aromas of menthol hitting your senses and filling your mind with memories. For\
  \ some these memories include that of a favorite gum or toothpaste flavor or perhaps\
  \ a mojito waiting at the bar. Or perhaps it\u2019s much more, perhaps it conjures\
  \ a slow smile and transports you to a separate continent across the ocean, at least\
  \ it does for me. Suddenly I am back in Morocco walking through the streets of Fez\
  \ excited to embrace the culture, one I have never known. Just arrived from Spain,\
  \ my tour group walks eagerly through the moroccan streets straight to the doors\
  \ of the Chouara Tannery. Our guide pauses for a moment and says something in Spanish\
  \ that I am not able to understand. It has been two months since moving to Granada,\
  \ Spain to study spanish and still my fluency is not well enough to understand rapid\
  \ speakers.The guide finishes, and we enter through a narrow doorway up three flights\
  \ of dark stairway to reach an open-roofed leather goods shop. As we enter the shop\
  \ the guide stands in the doorway handing out pieces of mint leaves. Being well\
  \ experienced with the gypsies in Spain who hand out sage and demand money after\
  \ accepting it, I opt out from taking the mint. The guide looked a bit perplexed\
  \ but didn\u2019t push the herb on me. I enter the room that opens up further to\
  \ a terrace overlooking the tannery pits, and that\u2019s when the stench hits me.\
  \ A mixture of rotting flesh and ammonia fill the air as we look out to the pits\
  \ of dyed water where men stand mixing the hides in the dyes of water. I walk around\
  \ observing the leathers and pits down below, but with the smell worsening. I begin\
  \ to notice all the people who wisely accepted the mint holding it under their noses\
  \ to mask the foul odor. Feeling quite foolish I try to ignore the smell but my\
  \ facial expressions must have told a novel because while I am struggling not to\
  \ gag the tour guide walks over to me with a smirk on his face and hands me some\
  \ mint leaves. I look at the mint and laugh before taking it and extending a grateful\
  \ smile to match his smirk. Holding the mint to my nose and taking in the slightly\
  \ sweet yet almost tangy aromas of menthol, I must possess a dramatic expression\
  \ of relief because he begins to chuckle, shakes his head slowly and touches my\
  \ shoulder before walking back to the group. In that moment I experienced an unspoken\
  \ language, a human language: one where not words but mint and foul odors united\
  \ two people."
