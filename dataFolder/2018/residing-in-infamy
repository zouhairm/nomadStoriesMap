Text: "\u201CHong Kong is a very safe city. Nothing bad will happen to you here. Except\
  \ in the building that you\u2019re staying in. Most dangerous place in all of Hong\
  \ Kong.\u201D\n\nEasily the last thing I expected to hear when I got into that taxi.\
  \ In the interest of saving money, I was staying in the infamous Chungking Mansions,\
  \ although its infamy was news to me at this point. My taxi driver, Due, on the\
  \ other hand, had all the inside information.\n\n\u201CPeople have died in there,\u2019\
  \ he said, not assuring me in the slightest.\n\n\u201CThe whole building is a health\
  \ hazard; a hub of criminal activity.\u201D\n\n\u201CYou\u2019ll be fine though,\u201D\
  \ he said, checking his blind spot and flicking on his indicator. I tried not to\
  \ hear the gentle ticking as the timer on my life as we drove closer to my destination.\
  \ \u201CJust promise that no matter how long the line for the elevator is, you won\u2019\
  t take the stairs. Do not take the stairs inside the Chungking Mansions, okay? We\u2019\
  re here.\u201D\n\nBuilt in the 1960s as an upmarket residential building in Hong\
  \ Kong\u2019s trendy Tsim Sha Tsui province, the Chungking Mansions are now home\
  \ to 15 identical floors of guesthouses and backpacker hostels, all perched upon\
  \ two storeys of labyrinthine market stalls selling everything from food, electronics\
  \ and clothing, to prostitutes, drugs, illegal passports and human organs. It\u2019\
  s estimated that around 10,000 people enter or exit the building per day; a collection\
  \ of third world traders, asylum seekers and backpackers, like me. Most of the local\
  \ Cantonese population are too scared to enter, despite increased surveillance and\
  \ security measures being implemented in recent years.\n\nThe first floor is a dizzying\
  \ maze of people, stalls, and the occasional live chicken. A cacophony of sound\
  \ greets me from every angle; merchants, traders and pamphlet wielding hostel owners\
  \ calling out to me from behind their stands.\n\n\u201CSIM card miss? Local SIM\
  \ card?\u201D\n\n\u201CVegetable samosa?\u201D \n\n\u201CGuest room for tonight?\u201D\
  \n\nI shake my head, and walk quickly past, looking for elevator block E. The market\
  \ is large and seems to get bigger the further in I walk, twisting and turning in\
  \ on itself. The colours are bright and the warm scent of exotic spices hangs in\
  \ the air, distracting and confusing me. Eventually I make a right past a stall\
  \ selling old Nokias from the early 2000s and find myself standing before elevator\
  \ block E. I press the button to call the lift, the doors open unsteadily and I\
  \ walk in, bracing myself for the next stage of my Chungking Mansions adventure;\
  \ checking in to my hostel."
