Text: "For four months of the year, Lars H\xE4ger lives in solitude at Tarfala; a\
  \ cluster of huts tucked away in a remote valley north of the Arctic Circle, with\
  \ large snow-covered mountains for company and little else. It\u2019s hard to tell\
  \ how old he is \u2013 his face, weathered by the arctic conditions and wind storms\
  \ that are common to the area, is that of an old man, but the physical demands of\
  \ his job maintaining the hut for visiting skiers suggests he may be younger. \n\
  \nOur journey to Tarfala by plane, car, snowmobile and on foot seems to have taken\
  \ forever, and as we stand in the shadow of Sweden\u2019s highest mountain, Kebnekaise,\
  \ the concept of time disappears. Up here, in the absence of electricity and running\
  \ water, the mountains and the weather dictate the way of life, not meetings, deadlines\
  \ or schedules.  As we sip the hot cordial Lars offers on our arrival, he tells\
  \ us what we need to know about staying at the hut; where to collect water; where\
  \ to chop wood for the fires in each bunk room; and how to clear the snow from the\
  \ dry toilet before use. It\u2019s a collaborative, hearty, and wholesome existence.\
  \ \n\nWe\u2019re here to ski, and with no chairlifts or pistes we\u2019ve attached\
  \ skins to the bottom of our skis and traverse up the mountain, alone, and in bright\
  \ sun and deep powder. After a two-hour ascent, we remove our skins and make fresh\
  \ tracks back down to the valley. As we approach the huts, we see Lars on a bench\
  \ in the snow outside his cabin, drinking coffee in the afternoon sun with some\
  \ other guests. Our guide Fred is cooking reindeer tonight, and with too much for\
  \ the four of us, Lars agrees to join.  \n\nHe arrives that evening with a bottle\
  \ of aquavit (a traditional Scandinavian flavoured spirit), his homemade pickled\
  \ herring and some crisp bread: classic Swedish fare to begin our meal. The other\
  \ residents smile in bemusement as Lars tries to teach us a Swedish drinking song\
  \ (without much success!), and four young Swedes join in our wobbly rendition. At\
  \ that precise moment, our own lives seem a million miles away, and Lars\u2019 choice\
  \ to spend half his life here, often alone, becomes increasingly understandable.\n\
  \nOn the morning of our departure, Lars appears holding a twig with coloured feathers\
  \ on it \u2013 a Swedish Easter tradition which symbolizes the coming of spring.\
  \ I can\u2019t help but feel emotional as he offers it to us \u2013 although we\u2019\
  d only spent two nights at Tarfala, Lars\u2019 presence was paramount to the spirit\
  \ of the place. Waving goodbye, we set off for Kebnekaise."
