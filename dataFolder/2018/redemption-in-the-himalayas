Text: "Popularly acclaimed as one of the best long distance trails in the world, the\
  \ Annapurna circuit in in central Nepal offers a fascinating range of sceneries\
  \ that evolves as the trail runs deeper into the Himalayas. It is a trail of great\
  \ aesthetic beauty that is heavily marked by cliffs, waterways, and drastic changes\
  \ in vegetation. A trail that isn't for the faint of heart for its course can stretch\
  \ up to 145 miles that translate to around 23 days of arduous hiking. Not that bad\
  \ of a hike considering all the mountain lodges scattered along the rout, each with\
  \ a restaurant and goods for purchase. It is a wonderful place to get lost in nature\
  \ and explore the great outdoors, but that wasn't the driving factor in my story.\
  \ For the past month of hanging around Pokhara, I had gotten a little too used to\
  \ smoking hashish and doing nothing as I rejoiced on a comfortably plain existence;\
  \ I'd been through hell before I got there. \"C'mon mate, we\xB4ll just go to Poon\
  \ Hill and come back. It'll be good for you.\" Said my friend, Aussie Max. I didn't\
  \ want to go, but there was a greater force pulling me towards the mountain. A calling\
  \ that came deep from within to leave a wrongful attitude behind and overcome my\
  \ personal demons. We took the municipal bus the next morning and began our ascent\
  \ on the unpaved road that marked the entrance. An elaborate trail of stone steps\
  \ followed, igniting a fire of excitement that I hadn't felt in ages. This was it,\
  \ the beginning of a new wilderness adventure. I was so excited that I never stopped\
  \ to question why we were the only ones entering the circuit; everyone else was\
  \ leaving. Everyone else was dressed for winter, we weren't. It was only after the\
  \ first snowfall that I regretted my decision. Everything in sight was covered in\
  \ white. I found myself struggling to keep living after paradise turned into the\
  \ coldest hell imaginable. \"I should have stayed in Pokhara.\" I said embittered.\
  \ Pain became a terrible reality; my body ached down to the bone and my shoes were\
  \ constantly wet. I wanted to escape, as I usually did, but there was no turning\
  \ back this time. The only way out was to endure through the pain and keep moving\
  \ forward. After five days of struggling with my demons, my mind settled. The snow\
  \ began receding as we reached the point of our decent and the clouds scattered\
  \ to reveal the a tender sun that seemed to be patting me in the back for a job\
  \ well done. Soon enough, beauty was returned to the world and I was reborn a better\
  \ man."
