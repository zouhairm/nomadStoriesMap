Text: "\u201CYou think we should turn back?\u201D he asked.\n\nI cocked my head to\
  \ the side and met what I could see of his concerned eyes in the dark, over his\
  \ hands, which were tightly gripping the steering wheel. His muscles were taut at\
  \ the tops of his tanned arms. His body swayed harshly back and forth as the boat\
  \ rocked wildly around him. His shirt, the light blue one that matches his eyes,\
  \ with Neptune holding a triton on it, whipped against him in the wind. His hair\
  \ and his eyes were both a little wild.\n\n\u201CNo way,\u201D I said. I gripped\
  \ the rail harder as the boat pitched more aggressively. Then, remembering I am\
  \ part of a team, I added quickly, \u201CI mean, I don\u2019t want to.\u201D After\
  \ all, as the embroidered pillow says (a quote my mom sent me shortly before we\
  \ left); \u201CCalm seas does not a good sailor make.\u201D\n\n[Later in the story]\n\
  \nIt felt like hitting a wall. The wind abruptly smacked into us and the boat immediately\
  \ began to rock badly side to side. Bill immerged from below, both hands firmly\
  \ griping each side of the companionway. He asked all the appropriate questions\
  \ with his eyes. It was dark out. very dark. We couldn\u2019t see the waves. Only\
  \ a few stars poked out of the clouds. We sat together, the three of us, an ominous\
  \ feeling creeping over everything like a think, wet blanket. Someone, it evades\
  \ me now whom, said softly, \u201C\u2026 so it begins.\u201D\n\nLater we would meet\
  \ a family who made the same crossing a day or two ahead of us, only in a boat a\
  \ stabilizing twelve feet longer.\n\n\u201CYou guys came from Key West too?\u201D\
  \ The captain asked.\n\n\u201CWe did. Yesterday.\u201D\n\nHe whistled through his\
  \ teeth as his wife started saying they weren\u2019t waiting to leave until the\
  \ last minute. \u201CFuck that,\u201D she said, shaking her short blond bob vigorously\
  \ back and forth as her big heavy glasses tried to stay on her face. She clutched\
  \ a silver thermos, with a sailboat on it, against her small frame like it was a\
  \ life raft and stared at the ground. No, Sir. They would be leaving the second\
  \ the weather looked good instead of hoping the weather was good when they had to\
  \ get back. Her big shiny eyes, more than anything, showed us how fearful she had\
  \ been.\n\n\u201CHow bigs yer boat?\u201D The captain asked as he put his arm protectively\
  \ around his wife.\n\n\u201CThirty four feet,\u201D all three of us replied in unison.\n\
  \nHis eyes grew satisfyingly wide. \u201CJesus,\u201D he said under his breath as\
  \ he rubbed his free hand over his face."
