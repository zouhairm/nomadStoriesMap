Text: "I skied to the brink of the mountain and looked down. In an instant, I became\
  \ profoundly aware of my heart pounding faster and prominently against my chest.\
  \ A scene of seemingly endless moguls, uninviting in appearance and covering a severe\
  \ vertical drop, unraveled before my eyes. Dread crept into my thoughts and throughout\
  \ my body as I came to the stark realization that I had never, in fact, attempted\
  \ a ski run this challenging. \n \x7F\x7F\nMoments prior, I\u2019d stood serenely\
  \ at the summit taking in the view. A vast expanse of the California Sierras staggered\
  \ against the bluest of skies, stretching as far as my eyes could see. A cool breeze\
  \ fell across my face, whipped my hair against my coat and I could smell the tall,\
  \ snow-dusted pines mixed into the air. With each intake of breath, I\u2019d felt\
  \ more at ease and as if I were melting into my surroundings. \n \nI could do this,\
  \ I decided. Taking a deep breath, I lurched forward and stepped off the edge. Instantly,\
  \ adrenaline kicked in, and my body was the strongest it had ever felt. I worked\
  \ in fast fluid motions, weaving in and out of the deep tracks, safely carving my\
  \ way. A glance at my shadow showed a great arch of snow tailing out behind me as\
  \ I pivoted, landing with a soft whooshing sound in my stead. With that sound came\
  \ a feeling from within, and before I knew it, I was laughing loudly with sheer\
  \ joy. \n \nHalfway down the mountain, the terrain leveled out and I stopped to\
  \ take a moment for myself. Here in the throes of one of the steepest, most daunting\
  \ ski runs in the Pacific Northwest, I recalled what a roller coaster of emotions\
  \ the last half hour had been. I thought of the skull and crossbones warning me\
  \ at the bottom of the lift, and the initial uncertainty I\u2019d felt about moving\
  \ forward. How I\u2019d gone from serenity atop the mountain, to fear in a breath,\
  \ and then intense elation with another. \n \nWith one last glance at the double\
  \ black diamond looming behind me, I turned around to again face that magnificent\
  \ backdrop of mountains and sky. Everything I'd done to get me to that exact moment\
  \ had started with the decision to try. Smiling to myself, I recognized that the\
  \ ups and downs in this small journey represented something much bigger than even\
  \ the mountain I was standing on. The only thing left to do was to move forward\
  \ down the path. So with the overwhelming power of accomplishment, I did just that\
  \ and vowed to never doubt myself again."
