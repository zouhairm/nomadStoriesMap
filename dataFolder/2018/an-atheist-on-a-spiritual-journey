Text: "Wiping the cold sweat off my forehead, I took a deep breath, grabbed tight\
  \ my paddle and started paddling the raft with both my hands when Ajay, our instructor\
  \ screamed \"FORWARD\". The madness of the silvery white rapids of the holy river\
  \ Ganges of Rishikesh intensified as we moved closer. My heart started pounding\
  \ so loudly that I could feel the heartbeats amidst the roar of the rapids. \"Return\
  \ to the sender\" was the name of those rapids as I wondered would it send us back\
  \ to the god.  Where would that send me as I was an atheist? Suddenly, the raft\
  \ was thrown up as the rapids were at the angriest at that place, where it looked\
  \ like the mother Ganges slapped me with a huge splash of water, hard on my face\
  \ due to which I stopped paddling as our raft went almost vertically down into the\
  \ rapids. In that blur of a moment, I started thinking of the time when I, being\
  \ an amateur, jumped recklessly into the deep side of a swimming pool when I was\
  \ just 12 and almost drowned. 13 years had passed since that incident and I had\
  \ never even set a foot in any swimming pool or a river, until now. I wasn't sure\
  \ if river rafting was an act of bravery or foolishness as I had \"Aquaphobia\"\
  - the fear of water.\nMy eyes wide open while my body froze seeing the angst of\
  \ river and thought that could be it, my last breath on Earth. Ajay shouted at the\
  \ top of his voice at me, \u201CDarr ke aage jeet hai\u201D, a famous dialog from\
  \ an Indian TV commercial of a cold drink which meant victory lies ahead of the\
  \ fears. With a rush of adrenaline, I shouted \u201CGanga Maiya ki Jai\u201D, let\
  \ the mother Ganges be victorious as respect to the Ganges, and started paddling\
  \ the waters as hard as I could. \nWhat Ajay said next put me into a shock. He said\
  \ to leave the paddles in the raft and jump into the rapids, cleanse our soul from\
  \ all the sins. I looked at him in horror because I was definitely not going to\
  \ jump but he started pushing everyone who didn't. \"Let go of the burden of negative\
  \ thoughts and dive into the river of positiveness\", said Ajay while pushing others\
  \ into the Ganges. I leaped into the icy cold waters before he came towards me.\n\
  Later on, Ajay informed us that we were actually floating on 60 feet deep water\
  \ which was the last thing I expected from me. With the unforgettable, spiritual\
  \ and awe-inspiring rafting experience in the midst of the hued mountains and milky\
  \ white rapids, I was finally over my phobia. Who could create all these beauties\
  \ of nature, if not God himself, the ultimate artist?"
