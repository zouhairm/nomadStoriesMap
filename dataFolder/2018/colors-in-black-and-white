Text: "I relaxed with a fresh cup of tea on a gorgeous morning at Sojha as my gaze\
  \ wandered over a lush green clearing a few meters away from my cottage. There she\
  \ was, seated on a stool in the sunshine with an easel. I felt drawn towards her\
  \ and wished to get acquainted before heading for my trek. So I made my way across\
  \ the valley. Her large canvas painting became visible as I approached closer. It\
  \ was an intriguing piece of art with an exquisite play of colors.\n\n\"Hello! Please\
  \ forgive me for interrupting you, but your painting is incredible!\" I exclaimed\
  \ wide-eyed.\n\n\"Oh! Thank you, err?\" she replied, surprised to have an unexpected\
  \ visitor.\n\n\u201CI\u2019m Jheel, I\u2019m traveling solo to explore the foothills.\u201D\
  \ I introduced myself. Discerning my keenness in her art as we conversed, Sasha\
  \ invited me to her studio to view her collection. I thanked her for her invitation\
  \ with a promise to visit and returned to base where my local guide Lal was waiting\
  \ for me to begin our trek.\n\n\"So, you met Sasha?\" inquired chatty old Lal, nodding\
  \ in her direction. \"Sasha is an admirable human and a remarkable artist! My wife\
  \ doubles up as her cook and\_house-help.\_Sasha is from Russia and has been living\
  \ here for 3 years. But few know the story she shared with my wife.\" he reflected.\n\
  \"Yes, she is a lovely lady! I'd love to know more about her.\" I said.\n\n\"Five\
  \ years ago Sasha and her 7-year-old son met with a tragic road accident in Moscow.\
  \ He succumbed to his wounds, and Sasha suffered a serious head injury, which affected\
  \ her sight. Doctors could not restore her color vision and she lost hope of being\
  \ a painter again. In fact, Sasha had stopped living her life after the mishap.\
  \ But then a friend who had visited India recommended a meditation therapy in the\
  \ Himalayas, which brought Sasha here. She found solace in the mountains and it\
  \ helped her resume painting despite her color-blind condition. She also began\_\
  teaching art to\_children.\" he narrated. \"Our village elders opine that the energy\
  \ of our sacred mountains and forest deities healed her broken spirit. Now her paintings\
  \ are more intense and emanate the connection between nature and human consciousness.\"\
  \ he reminisced.\n\nI froze in my tracks speechless as Sasha's enigmatic personality\
  \ flashed before me. An epitome of resilience, Sasha had embraced the present by\
  \ choosing life over\_loss. \u201CLet the beauty of what you\_love\_be what you\
  \ do.\u201D said Rumi. Aren't we all poets and artists at some point\_in our lives?\
  \ I couldn\u2019t wait to meet her again."
