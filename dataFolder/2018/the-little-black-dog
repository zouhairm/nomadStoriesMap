Text: "So maybe it all started with a little black dog, lying on the scolding pavement,\
  \ skinny and shiny, barely opening its eyes, a chain around its neck and no future\
  \ in sight.  I saw myself in that little dog, that feeling of no escape, of a life\
  \ unlived, and bleak prospects. I did not think or worry, I hardly even questioned\
  \ the feat I was about to attempt. I had no plans until that moment, and a new adventure\
  \ started for us as together we walked away down the street, and hopped on a bus\
  \ heading north.\nIn Central America you can ride on the roof of the buses. Sitting\
  \ on the rusty racks, with a puppy on a my lap, ducking stray branches, feeling\
  \ the hot, dry air dance with my hair, I questioned where I was going, what I was\
  \ doing. The houses we passed were barely standing, fashioned from metal salvaged\
  \ from scrap yards, wood washed up on the untamed shores, plastic stolen from abandoned\
  \ machinery and factories. The kids playing in the street laughed and waved when\
  \ they saw the girl from worlds away, and the black puppy in her arms. The Nicaraguan\
  \ sun beat down upon us, and we rolled to a stop in a tiny town, with little more\
  \ than fishing boats and farmland scattering the sides of the only road, in and\
  \ out. Here me and Nica hid from the decision I had made, met many beautiful people,\
  \ learnt to speak a little Spanish and to ride horses, and surfed in all the free\
  \ time I had from the project we were living on, in a converted school bus abandoned\
  \ from the North of America, teaching children to share and play, and keeping them\
  \ out of trouble. The sand burnt my feet and Nicas paws, as we ran towards the waves\
  \ and the warm waters with all the little boys that spent their days surfing and\
  \ repairing boards in the shade. \n\nI met a boy called Carlos, whose uncle was\
  \ called Carlos, whose father was called Carlos, and whose little brother was called\
  \ Carlitos. They lived on a shrimp farm miles away from the village. One day, he\
  \ took me to his finca. The sun set over the lakes. Dusty pink and gold. The fisherman\
  \ silhouetted. Droplets sparkling. Plans were formed in the dying light, surrounded\
  \ by chickens and white cattle with curling horns, stray dogs with sandy coats and\
  \ new friends. Me, my girl and one unbelievable adventure ahead of us."
