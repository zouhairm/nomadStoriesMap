Text: "We had been at Taino Beach for a mere five hours when we were kidnapped by\
  \ a salty, one-eyed, half Scottish and half Caribbean pirate named Tony Biscuit.\
  \ \nFueled by free rum punch and that sense of freedom only parents with young children\
  \ can appreciate, we scuttled toes-first through the white sand into the cobalt\
  \ infinity of the Atlantic. We knew we were in paradise, what we didn\u2019t know\
  \ was that we were also waist deep in a pirate stronghold that had been shanghai-ing\
  \ wanderers since Columbus sailed the ocean blue. \n\nThe lazy river emptied into\
  \ the sky lit grotto offering two pink South Dakotans a short break from the sun\
  \ and a taste of refreshment, twelve ounces at a time. \n\u201CA Bahama Mama for\
  \ the Bahama Mama,\u201D he said, \u201Cand a Sands for her daddy.\u201D He set\
  \ the mixed drink and beer on the mosaic bartop with practiced nonchalance. We hadn\u2019\
  t ordered but the order was perfect. He lifted his shades and winked his left eye.\n\
  \n\u201CThis is Tony Biscuit,\u201D she said,\u201Dhe only has one eye but he knows\
  \ everything about Freeport.\u201D Paula was from the Twin Cities celebrating her\
  \ 40th birthday. Our shared Midwestern heritage and fondness for rum punch made\
  \ quick friends. She invited Amber and me to join her for a night on the island\
  \ and we agreed to meet after a quick shower. \n\nAs we stepped into Tony\u2019\
  s Jeep I overheard him on the phone with Andrew and Nick, \u201C\u2026I need you\
  \ to take out three in 30 minutes.\u201D\n\u201CWhere\u2019re we headed?\u201D I\
  \ asked and he replied Eight Mile Rock. \u201CSounds like a prison,\u201D I joked\
  \ but he just smiled. Even though the sun was setting he was still wearing his dark\
  \ glasses.\n\nHalf an hour of twists and turns along Jolly Roger\u2019s road and\
  \ we were clearly where tourists seldom roam.  Tony parked the car, telling us to\
  \ stay put, and I asked Paula what was up. \u201CI have no Idea,\u201D she said\
  \ staring out the window. It was in that moment I realized I had taken my wife into\
  \ a stranger\u2019s vehicle to destination unknown. We had no passport, no cell\
  \ service and no idea where we were.\n\nIt seemed like forever before Tony suddenly\
  \ opened the door and the smell hit us....\nTurns out, A&N Chicken serves the best\
  \ darn jerked chicken in the West Indies and you\u2019ll never hear of them in a\
  \ travel brochure.\n\nAs blue as the sky had been when we landed, the moonless night\
  \ was blacker. The four of us sat on the breakwater, our feet dangling as the Atlantic\
  \ swam ashore.\n\u201CWhat is this place?\u201D\n\u201CLovers Beach,\u201D Tony\
  \ looked at me smiling.\n\u201CWelcome to the real Bahamas,\u201D he said, winking\
  \ his right eye."
