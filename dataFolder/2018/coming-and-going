Text: "I never envisioned being so worthy to a crowd that each person abandons good\
  \ graces to take my photo or stare me down. I guess that\u2019s one of the drawbacks\
  \ of being a member of the First Family. \n\nIn the 1960s, my grandfather was the\
  \ Prime Minister for the Republic of the Seychelles. Soon after, he was elected\
  \ as the nation\u2019s first President, liberating the country from colonial British\
  \ rule, and securing his profile on golden rupees and bank notes. My mom would later\
  \ use these as casual home decor, right next to her TJ Maxx candle holders.\n\n\
  In the US, the Seychelles was abstract to me; ignorant strangers always thought\
  \ it didn\u2019t exist. In the Seychelles, my intimate family bubble kept me from\
  \ truly resonating with my surroundings. As a child, I admired the beaches and adored\
  \ the attention I received at the dinner table, but my perception was narrow. Still,\
  \ I managed to grasp a few things.\n\nFor instance, time is relative. In America,\
  \ time buzzes, ebbs, flows, and flies. In the islands, it rarely moves. The tortoises\
  \ and tourists are continuously sunbathing like they both depend on it. The palm\
  \ trees never fail to shimmy, and the Seybrews are flowing whether the sun is up,\
  \ down, or anywhere in between. You\u2019re frozen in paradise like a blended pina\
  \ colada: everything is beautiful.\n\nThen, in January 2017, my mom received an\
  \ unexpected call that my grandfather had passed away, and time stopped here, too.\
  \ In a daze, we were commissioned to organize and attend the country\u2019s first\
  \ state funeral. \n\nThree days later, with unworldly jetlag and a heart heavier\
  \ than gravity to the ocean, I gave my grandfather\u2019s eulogy on national television,\
  \ grieving publicly with a voice that barely confined its own shakes. Crowds swarmed\
  \ the chapel. I protected my mother as we were escorted between venues, endlessly\
  \ shaking hands as foreign politicians tried to pry smiles out of us for photos.\
  \ Not this time.\n\nMy grandfather was a worldly man, but his heart was always strewn\
  \ between these islands. I didn\u2019t recognize that until I stared out into those\
  \ crowds, made eye contact with his opposition, and exchanged stories with his admirers.\
  \ It took his loss for me to recognize what he did, who I am, and how each sandy\
  \ corner of that country runs deep in our veins.\n\nThat trip gave me a local connection\
  \ to every droplet of sky over my head, as well as every woman, child, and coco\
  \ de mer tree. Seychelles is the land of my ancestors and my culture, but it took\
  \ me 21 years to feel it."
