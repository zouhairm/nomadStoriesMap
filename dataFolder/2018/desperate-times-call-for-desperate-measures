Text: "I started travelling two years ago. On one of my escapades, I had an adventure\
  \ that changed the way I travel for ever. Having always had a thing for uncharted\
  \ spots, I once went to a remote spot in the lesser Himalayas. I had heard that\
  \ the place offers a spectacular sunrise and had planned to see. Without telling\
  \ anyone from my family, I took the early morning bus to the place. My calculations\
  \ told me I would reach home by nightfall. In the bus, I was told by the driver\
  \ that if I was to return, I would have to take the bus leaving at 5 pm that day.\
  \ If I failed to take that bus, I would be stuck in that place for the next two\
  \ months. That bus was to be the last bus for the season before snowfall began.\
  \ The place hardly had any houses so, missing the bus would mean I would die within\
  \ a day or two in the cold. Absent-minded that I was, I forgot all about the warning\
  \ upon reaching the place. The sunrise was heavenly and so was the place. It wasn\u2019\
  t until 6 pm that I remembered that I had to take the last bus.\nI was stranded\
  \ at a remote corner of the Himalayas. Heavy snowfall was sure to follow. I was\
  \ many kilometres away from civilisation. Had I shouted for help, only wild animals\
  \ would have heard it; the region was home to wolves, bears and leopards. Starving\
  \ and hypothermia weren\u2019t the only ways to die here: I could also become dinner\
  \ for some wild animal. This was the most desperate of all desperate times ever.\
  \ I was scared to death. Added to this was the fact that my family didn\u2019t know\
  \ I was here. A two-month long search would ensue and my family would know the truth\
  \ only after the snow would melt and my body would be discovered. All this was terrible\
  \ to think of and this is what pushed me to the edge: quite literally.\nHad I taken\
  \ the road, it would have taken me all night. I had to rule it out because I did\
  \ not have all night. There was also a high chance of a rendezvous with wild animals.\
  \ I had to think of a way to reach the town below that hill. From that town I could\
  \ easily get a bus to my city. This is when I took the most impractical decision\
  \ of my life.\nWithin ten minutes, I had tied my backpack around my privates like\
  \ an underwear and was sliding down the rugged mountainside with nothing but the\
  \ backpack to save my bottom. Many bruises and a bus ride later, I reached home\
  \ just in time for dinner. When I look back now, it feels like a stupid thing to\
  \ do. But, the spontaneity of the moment is  what really keeps me going. What is\
  \ life without risk?"
