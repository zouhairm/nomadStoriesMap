Text: "The hair on my arms was standing straight up, despite the warm sun shining\
  \ on us. My throat tightened up as I listened, my eyes watered as she spoke.\n\n\
  It was a summer afternoon in Arromanche-les-Bains, a small village nestled among\
  \ the D-Day beaches. Remnants of the infamous Mulberry Harbour are here, and we\
  \ had spent the evening before gazing on them in the sunset. We'd been exploring\
  \ the coast and D-Day beaches for a little over a week so far, stopping at monuments,\
  \ museums, plaques, and seeing remnants of the destructive war on farm structures\
  \ and walls as we bicycled by.\n\nWe were tenting in the municipal campground, soaking\
  \ up the sun, drinking wine, cleaning our bicycles and doing wash. It was in the\
  \ laundry room that I met her - an older woman, shorter than me with sandy blonde\
  \ hair and colorful shirt. I initiated a clumsy conversation that progressed from\
  \ laundry to pleasantries in mediocre French, and eventually found it's way to English.\
  \ \n\nShe was from Brussels, on an annual RV trip with her husband. She asked about\
  \ our bicycle tour, and where we were from. To date, no one had cared that we were\
  \ American. It was Alaska, our home, that caught their attention. Not that we could\
  \ blame them - Alaska is a slice of paradise, and we were happy to speak to it.\
  \ But not this woman. She honed in on America, and told me a story I could never\
  \ have anticipated or asked for.\n\nShe was a child in Brussels during World War\
  \ II. The war touched her town, her life, and made her frightened. There was no\
  \ future - just surviving the present. She told me that she didn't know if she would\
  \ survive, and tried to explain to me the emotion, the fear, the electricity she\
  \ was producing during those days. She was relaying the history she had lived to\
  \ me, and it was holding me in place on the walkway. \n\n\"Americans...\" she started.\
  \ They liberated her. They saved her life and her family's life. She was indebted\
  \ to those soldiers. I was silent, locked on her eyes, face, mouth as she told me\
  \ this story, and I watched her eyes water and her mind go somewhere else. \"I come\
  \ here often, to Arromanche. We go to the cemetery. And I walk from grave to grave,\
  \ as far as I can, saying 'Thank you for your service' to each headstone.\" \n\n\
  No plaque, short film, or cannonball hole could have prepared me for her story,\
  \ and our shared emotional responses. I took in the weight of history resting on\
  \ her, and despite the still air, I shivered. We wiped our eyes, shared a smile\
  \ and went our separate ways."
