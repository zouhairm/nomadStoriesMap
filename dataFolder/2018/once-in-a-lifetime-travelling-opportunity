Text: "Upon arrival to my destination in the beautiful city of Cape Town in 2016,\
  \ on the first day on my trip I was tired, confused and a bit moody because I had\
  \ taken a 15 hours trip from my home town of King William\u2019s Town to a city\
  \ I had never been in. I was traveling with my mother and was to stay at her cousin\u2019\
  s house for the week until I could find school and be settled.\nFor a small town\
  \ girl being in a very big city was daunting and scary. So I had to adjust and adapt\
  \ to the changes because I had entered adult world and had to be independent real\
  \ quickly. In my first week in Cape Town was very fun because I did a lot of site\
  \ seeing with family and experiencing the city. I visited Table Mountain and was\
  \ able to witness the whole city. \nSo came time for me to begin with school and\
  \ have my mother leave me so that I could fend for myself, the whole first year\
  \ in Cape town was a bit challenging because I felt lost and lonely. Not knowing\
  \ the city that well also did not help because I experienced my fair share of getting\
  \ lost and having to trust the locals for directions. Cape Town locals are pretty\
  \ good and welcoming people so getting friends was easy and helpful. My first year\
  \ in 2016 I was studying Somatology which I learned later on in the year, it was\
  \ not what I really wanted to study. I felt stuck and uninspired in that course\
  \ and decided to change it the following year to something that was more interesting\
  \ and fun for me which was Journalism. i had aapplied and followed all the processes\
  \ required to get in and luckily i was accepted and then a new leaf in life began\
  \ for me. \n\nStudying Journalism has not only taught me a lot but the people I\
  \ am studying with have helped me grow as a person in how I view the world in general,\
  \ I never expected to grow so much knowledge about myself and the world in such\
  \ a short space of time. If it wasn\u2019t for school unfortunately I would only\
  \ see the world from a small town girl view and not experience much. So I urge everyone\
  \ even in their own space and time even if it is not for school to visit a different\
  \ city or province etc. just to learn more about themselves and their surrounding\
  \ there is so much beauty and information out there in the world so if everyone\
  \ could experience that, would be amazing.traveling and exploring one's surroundings\
  \ is very important for their thought process and decision making in life.\n\ni\
  \ am grateful for Cape Town for teaching me independence and experiencing its beauty"
