Text: "How to learn a country\nNauka kraju\nC\xF3mo aprender un pa\xEDs \n\n\n She\
  \ wrote down different titles and looked at them as if beneath the surface of words\
  \ the whole world or even entire worlds would lie peacefully, just waiting for the\
  \ explorer to come and discover them. \n She wasn\u2019t an English speaker or at\
  \ least not an English native speaker. Deep inside her, she had that feeling that\
  \ she didn\u2019t quite understand the language. The meaning was clear but the language\
  \ itself with its construction, its melody, its inner rules about how to build up\
  \ the phrases, maintain the rhythm, in general, how to write, seemed overwhelming,\
  \ distant, unknown. English was like a closed box, big old wooden chest standing\
  \ somewhere  at the attic. She knew she didn\u2019t quite feel the language.\n With\
  \ Spanish it was different. Somehow the reality of the language was clear. At least\
  \ she knew one of many different realities, or even two. There was a warm sunny\
  \ Granada where Muslim, Jewish and Christian cultures melted in one many years ago\
  \ and Catalan-Castellan Barcelona, a harbour open to different cultures and to too\
  \ many tourists. \n With English, the whole trouble consisted of lack of references.\
  \ When she was reading academic texts they refer to phenomenons she knew, so it\
  \ was fine, but with literature it was a completely different story. Even when she\
  \ understood words, she was missing the whole picture, it was as she would have\
  \ many puzzles, thousands of singular pieces, but apparently they wouldn\u2019t\
  \ match any particular reality she knew, and therefore, putting them together was\
  \ an impossible task.\n That was before. What has changed since then,\_she wondered.\
  \ She looked suspiciously at the book cover. Something must have changed. When reading\
  \ these stories she could suddenly feel them, they weren\u2019t distant or unfamiliar,\
  \ they rather seem close. \n\n***\nTo enter the country doesn\u2019t mean to cross\
  \ the border, pass the customs, go through automatic glass doors. To enter the country\
  \ means to understand it and this kind of understanding does not require ability\
  \ of language or at least not only. First and foremost it requires you to look and\
  \ see. \n***\n\n Calgary. A week. It took her one week: a smiling waitress at the\
  \ Ethiopian restaurant, this nice vagabond collecting money on her way to the train\
  \ with whom she started to interchange hellos, and a friendly Hungarian lady at\
  \ the library. They offered her a key to understand this vast country."
