Text: "In the early months of 2016, two good friends and I took to the raucous tropical\
  \ islands that litter the east coast of Phuket, in an ambitious, yet, surprisingly\
  \ successful attempt at distracting myself from a recent failed relationship. We\
  \ spent a week staying in a small, beach-front hostel on phi phi island, a mere\
  \ 20 minute boat ride from iconic maya bay (the secluded setting of Leonardo Di\
  \ caprio's classic 2000 film 'the beach'). I expected plenty of things from this\
  \ adventure: debauchery, some not-so-fresh mornings, crippling sunburn and a resultingly\
  \ dismal bank balance - All expectations of which were met comfortably (in the first\
  \ 24 hours, no less.) it was the unexpected experiences, however, which made this\
  \ getaway so memorable. Mornings spent watching the south-east Asian sunrise, my\
  \ hand in that of a fleeting romance as we strolled the beach, surrounded by evidence\
  \ of the previous nights revelry scattered in the sand around us. Sincere bonds\
  \ of friendship formed with absolute strangers, from all corners of the world, that\
  \ still hold strong to this day. Intellectual connections with people i have known\
  \ my entire adult life, on a level that we didn't know existed, all whilst sipping\
  \ suspicious concoctions from buckets on the rooftop of the seediest bars Thailand\
  \ has to offer.\nYou see, friendship, romance, serenity and festivity are not new\
  \ concepts to me, nor are they an unexpected outcome of a week-long island getaway.\
  \ It's the surge of pure, unbridled elation that accompanies the combination of\
  \ all of life's most sought after pleasures, simultaneously injected into a previously\
  \ stale existence which caught me off guard. The island appeared to exclusively\
  \ attract young, wide-eyed humans from just about every country you can find on\
  \ a map - all of whom are momentarily devoid of any kind of restrictions or responsibility.\
  \ In circumstances like this, rare though they are, there is relentless and unmistakable\
  \ atmosphere of joy, celebration and palpable positivity. \nAlas, the party can't\
  \ last forever. There are bills to be payed, bosses to obey and mums to assure that\
  \ you're still alive. The real world awaits. I might not have been able to stay\
  \ for long, but I returned home refreshed, with a newly acquired lust for excitement\
  \ and marvel. As I returned to my cubicle on Monday morning, in a grey suit and\
  \ tie, I found myself wondering: \"is this the real world?\""
