Text: "I was unpacking my things while my roommate was getting ready to leave. \u201C\
  Do you want to smoke a joint in the rooftop?\u201D It was my first hour in Delhi\
  \ and adventure was kicking in. We headed up the hostel deck, just in time for sunset.\n\
  \nHe was talking much more than I did. I would look over the balcony and take a\
  \ few deep sighs, a mix of excitement and fear for what was coming. \u201CDude,\
  \ there are no answers,\u201D he concluded.\n\nI traveled to India by myself, with\
  \ two backpacks and a lot of clich\xE9s. It was an attempt to find peace. It had\
  \ to be India: exotic, spiritual, transformative. And despite knowing July was the\
  \ worst time to travel there being monsoon season, I insisted to go. It was my birth\
  \ month. And I wanted for it to be symbolic of a rebirth, of going back home a changed\
  \ man, of finally feeling better about life, of not wanting to die anymore.\n\n\
  I headed to Varanasi, a place that has always been an object of my dreams. Chaos\
  \ is an understatement. But I was finally in the oldest city in the world and the\
  \ holiest place in India\u2014what a time to be alive! I avoided touristy activities\
  \ and insisted on walking along the Ganges River myself, snaking my way through\
  \ the labyrinth of narrow alleyways, sipping hot chai along the way, hoping to bump\
  \ into a holy man who would tell me the secrets to life. But there I was, crying\
  \ in the middle of a dark alley as I got scammed by a local who promised to take\
  \ me to the burning ghats\u2014where they burn the dead and flow to the river as\
  \ a way to get to heaven\u2014in exchange of English lessons. He wanted two thousand\
  \ rupees.\n\nThe next days got better. The purity of Taj Mahal moved me to tears.\
  \ The hostel crew threw me a birthday party. But it seemed like my roommate was\
  \ right. The questions multiplied, the answers nowhere to find. The noise of India\u2019\
  s streets echoed within. I began thinking this trip was an expensive, wrong idea.\n\
  \nOn my last train ride about to leave the country, I was seated beside an old man.\
  \ Without speaking a word, he showed me an image of a quote about the past, present,\
  \ and future. He started telling stories about Buddha, on emptying the heart at\
  \ night, and not forgetting to smile. My tears were unstoppable for three hours.\
  \ Just right before the lights went off, he poked my chest and said, \"Don't go\
  \ run away next time, peace is within.\"\n\nI traveled to India looking for peace.\
  \ And as I have given up on it, the last thing I expected was to find the answers\
  \ from a guru on the train. The journey has just begun."
