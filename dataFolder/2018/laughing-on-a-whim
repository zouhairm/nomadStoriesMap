Text: "It had been over 20 years since I had been back to Vienna, having spent a solid\
  \ chunk of my youth there thanks to my Austrian mother (who, subsequently, had a\
  \ family fallout). After running a marathon in Greece and being stranded in an Istanbul\
  \ airport, Vienna presented a welcome and heart full conclusion to my most recent\
  \ Europe-with-no-plan backpacking trip. As soon as I emerged from the U-Bahn into\
  \ Stephansplatz, the smell of wienerschnitzel, the expressive Austrian dialect,\
  \ the signs, all of it felt so familiar. I spent 3 days wandering, reminiscing,\
  \ imagining. On my last night, on my last wander, I passed the small Roo Bar, a\
  \ dive ostensibly for Australian expats, with a sign out front: \u201COpen Mic Comedy\
  \ Show Tonight.\u201D I\u2019ve been a touring standup for years, playing colleges\
  \ and clubs all over the US, but had no intention of staging my laughs in Vienna.\
  \ Regardless, I had to see what an Austrian Open Mic was like. I descended to the\
  \ basement amid the sounds of a German-speaking emcee cajoling a packed crowd who\
  \ were literally hanging from the rafters (I always thought that was just a phrase).\
  \ They were wild and forgiving, applause and laughter mixed with the air of strong\
  \ stale Austrian beer. The crowd was young, intellectual, rabid and almost stacked\
  \ on top of each other. The comedians were adequate...and were killing in both English\
  \ and German. I was exhausted, had no cash and an early flight, but how could I\
  \ resist performing in this fire hazard? I caught the emcee\u2019s attention on\
  \ the stairs. \u201CDo you have any slots left?\u201D \u201CIt\u2019s pretty crowded.\
  \ Have you done standup comedy before?\u201D \u201CYeah. I\u2019m a regular at the\
  \ Comedy Store.\u201D \u201CIn Hollywood?! Want to close the show? How much time\
  \ do you want to do?\u201D My resume had immediately been built up. \u201C20 minutes?\u201D\
  \ \u201CGreat!\u201D I walked back up the stairs. What had I done? My jokes are\
  \ very American, and very regional. Could I do 20 minutes in front of a mixed crowd?\
  \ What would I say, and how can I live up to this last-minute billing? I waited\
  \ with sweaty palms, heart beating, audience eagerly anticipating this \u201Cspecial\
  \ guest star.\u201D So I did what I had done for the previous 2 weeks on my backpacking\
  \ trip, the advice I give anyone who travels, the best go-to for having a real adventure:\
  \ I winged it. Improvised. Riffed. Played with the crowd. Even tried some basic\
  \ German. And killed. For 30 minutes. I took a risk, said \u201Cyes\u201D (or rather\
  \ \u201Cwhy the hell not?\u201D) and can add The Roo Bar in Vienna, Austria to my\
  \ resume!"
