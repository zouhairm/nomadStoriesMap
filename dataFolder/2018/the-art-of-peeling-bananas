Text: "The salty ocean breeze whispered around me as I stumbled, still half asleep,\
  \ towards the dim sound of voices.   A rooster crowed nearby, ignoring the fact\
  \ that it was not yet dawn and the gritty smell of smoke mingled with damp earth\
  \ filled the air.\n\nI headed for a small fale, or traditional Samoan house, unique\
  \ because of the lack of one particular feature normally considered essential: walls.\
  \  Instead, strong wooden beams supported a high roof thatched with coconut leaves.\
  \  This fale was used solely for cooking and work for Sunday\u2019s feast was already\
  \ well underway.\n\nMy entrance was met with good-natured ribbing.\n\u201CWe\u2019\
  re almost finished!\u201D grinned Losa through missing teeth, her strong hands working\
  \ quickly to grate a coconut, \u201CGo back to bed!\u201D  \nBut even as she said\
  \ the words she handed me a woven basket followed by brisk instructions to peel\
  \ the green bananas inside.  Unlike ripe bananas, green ones are stubbornly hard\
  \ to peel.\n\nAfter some time trying unsuccessfully to peel my bananas with my hands\
  \ I heard stifled chuckles.  I looked up and Losa lost it, laughing so hard she\
  \ cried.\n\n\"Here like this,\" she grinned at me, grabbing a knife and making a\
  \ long slit down the side.  She then proceeded to carefully prise the skin off.\
  \  In a minute she was left with a perfect, white banana.\n\nI tried again with\
  \ the knife, attempting to mimic Losa's practiced movements.  Ten minutes later\
  \ my banana was done but it looked liked an elephant had attempted to peel it. \
  \ I tossed it in the basket sheepishly and picked up another continuing until I\
  \ had finished the basket.\n\n In the meantime, Losa and her family and finished\
  \ preparing and peeling the taro, breadfruit and fish.  Plus built a whole oven\
  \ from scratch using hot stones and banana leaves and all before sunrise.   I was\
  \ in awe of their work ethic.  It was the weekend, and a Sunday morning.  It was\
  \ still dark and yet everyone was happily going about their tasks.\n\nHours later\
  \ as we ate the delicious food shared with family, friends and neighbors I was struck\
  \ struck by the absence of things.  Mobile phones, TV\u2019s, expensive kitchen\
  \ gadgets.  Instead these were replaced with diligence,  and a selfless willingness\
  \ to put others before self.    The result?  More love, laughter and life than anywhere\
  \ else I\u2019d ever been.  \n\n\"Pass me another banana?\" I asked, \"I'm gonna\
  \ miss these when I leave.\""
