Text: "Standing on the side of a New Zealand highway with my thumb out, I remembered\
  \ my mother\u2019s warning that if I ever tried hitchhiking, I would certainly die.\
  \ Whether by the driver\u2019s hands or hers, I did not clarify. But since I was\
  \ going to try it, anyway, and in the interest of my health, I did not inform her\
  \ of me standing on the side of a New Zealand highway with my thumb out.\n\n My\
  \ first driver\u2019s name was Gary, a hulking man with a frame that was once pure\
  \ muscle, but transitioned with his hairline. He pulled over in a black hatchback.\n\
  \n Though I recalled my mother, I was convinced of Gary\u2019s casual demeanor.\
  \ He then assured me of it when he revealed that he picks up every hitchhiker, regardless\
  \ of appearance, and that I was hundred and hundred and something.\n\n Relieved,\
  \ I defaulted to my most comfortable self, and within minutes, Gary pinpointed how\
  \ I was from California. When asked how he knew, he said, \u201CYour aura is sunshine\
  \ and waves.\u201D An insightful recognition, I thought. Gary went on to theorize\
  \ that happier people generally live by coastlines and hillsides. He said that those\
  \ people, when stressed, have a place to go.\n\n Soon, Gary showed himself as a\
  \ storyteller. My favorite in his series was how he sustained an injury as a post\
  \ driver which resulted in his forearm hanging on by flesh strings. After resisting\
  \ shock, he greeted the emergency room counter, \u201CHi, I\u2019m Gary. I\u2019\
  ll be your patient for the day.\u201D\n\n We spoke for hours, and his insights taught\
  \ me the benefits of living with intentions instead of plans. Intentions are relaxed,\
  \ flexible, and capitalize when it\u2019s opportune, while plans are likely to disappoint\
  \ when even one feature fails expectations.\n\n When we stopped for gas, I held\
  \ us back while choosing a snack for us to share. With customers behind and in front\
  \ of us, we unintentionally timed our transaction to win a free tank of fuel. Gary\
  \ seemed to shrug it off, and I could see how he\u2019s the type of person to casually\
  \ greet an emergency room. But I saw the event as a direct reward for us coming\
  \ together on this journey.\n\n After Gary, I would go on to share journeys with\
  \ seven other drivers through 1,200 kms. Though I think there\u2019s reason in my\
  \ mother\u2019s hesitation to trust strangers, I\u2019m convinced that New Zealand\
  \ is where the better qualities of humanity won out in deciding the culture, and\
  \ locals like Gary offer to share themselves in addition to their vehicles."
