Text: "The last glimmer from the sun was fading in the distance over the Tyrrhenian\
  \ Sea as I leaned over the balcony. I sighed heavily, looking down at the waves\
  \ bashing against the sharpened rocks on the stunning Amalfi coast. The looming\
  \ stress persisted to distract me from the surrounding beauty. Just then, a shadow\
  \ slowly approached from behind; I heard the tip-tap of black dress shoes on the\
  \ wooden planks and the rustle of the fabric of his dress coat. \u201CHi, Fabrizio,\u201D\
  \ I greeted our piano festival coordinator.\n\nHe asked, in a bass tone, \u201C\
  Jamie, what are you doing out here, by yourself?\u201D His Italian accent made me\
  \ smile involuntarily. I explained that I was nervous about performing in tomorrow\u2019\
  s masterclass. I was totally out of my league in this piano festival (or so I felt).\
  \ The pianists from all over the world that had been performing all day had my self-doubt\
  \ on the rise. Fabrizio smiled, put his hand on my shoulder, and said, \u201CYou\
  \ worry too much\u201D. \nHe bought us both glasses of limoncello and we went for\
  \ an evening contemplative stroll on the beach. There was a part of me that thought\
  \ it unwise to be alone with a stranger on a secluded beach, but he had been the\
  \ only comforting person I\u2019d met at this festival, aside from two other friends\
  \ who were as equally intimidated by the other performers. I gazed around the beach\
  \ at the sharp crags piercing through the sand. Above them, the colorful houses\
  \ snuggled closely together in nests of trees on the fringes of the cliffs. The\
  \ moon reflected off of Fabrizio\u2019s glasses as he escorted me along the beach,\
  \ telling me about the area and its hidden gems (one of which I would discover to\
  \ be the best pizza I\u2019ve ever eaten in my life). I still wondered what his\
  \ motive was for showing me so much kindness. Several times, he turned to me with\
  \ that charming smile, \u201CJamie, Jamie. You worry too much.\u201D Again, involuntary\
  \ smile. \n\nMy mind wandered. 'What if I blew it tomorrow in front of one of the\
  \ world\u2019s most renowned pedagogues? Even more, my piano professor for the next\
  \ two years would be watching.' It seemed as if there was so much on the line. \u201C\
  Jamie, you\u2019re worrying too much again.\u201D I glanced at him as we walked;\
  \ his calm eyes half-open, his head held high. He didn\u2019t return the glance.\
  \ He only kept walking at a friendly pace back toward the hotel.\nBy the time we\
  \ returned to the hotel balcony, my mind was at ease. Little did I know I\u2019\
  d learn more from his words than anything I\u2019d learn from the masterclass the\
  \ next day."
