Text: "\"This is your Captain speaking. We are beginning our descent into Beirut.\
  \ The temperature is a balmy 30 degrees and not a cloud in sight. Welcome, Ahlaan.\"\
  \ \n\nSo this is it. I am finally visiting the home my parents knew for 18 years\
  \ before migrating to Australia. After resisting the many attempts of my mum to\
  \ get me to visit her homeland, at 25 years old I've finally succumbed. Mainly because\
  \ we struck a deal - if I would make Lebanon my first stop on the around-the-world\
  \ working holiday I had planned, my parents would give me their blessings to go.\
  \ \n\nAfter 20 hours sandwiched between a hairy middle-aged Arab man who struggled\
  \ to get his seat buckle to meet in the middle, and the white-haired, leather-skinned\
  \ old lady who held on to her tan leather handbag for dear life the entire flight\
  \ - I was excited to collect my luggage and have some breathing space.\n\nMum had\
  \ arranged for my Uncle Antoon, her youngest of six brothers, to meet me at the\
  \ airport. We met once when he visited Sydney for my older sisters wedding. He seemed\
  \ nice enough, but my Arabic was rusty and his English pretty much non-existent,\
  \ so I had a feeling the two-hour drive to our family's village in the mountains\
  \ was going to be gruelling. \n\n\"Habibi Jemili - over here habibi!\" I heard him\
  \ before I saw him. I forgot how embarrassingly loud my mum's family can be. Uncle\
  \ Antoon was waving his arms above his head with a grin from ear to ear. I couldn't\
  \ help but smile as I rushed towards him, he looked exactly like mum with a moustache.\
  \ \"Hello Umo! Kifak? So good to see you.\" We gave eachother a hug and then he\
  \ instantly pulled out his scratched up iPhone 5 to FaceTime mum and prove that\
  \ I arrived safely. \n\n\"Remember your manners Jemili. Make sure you make the effort\
  \ with your clothes and makeup, I don't want the village to think I didn't raise\
  \ a lady. Don't eat too much food in front of everyone and don't be shy to speak\
  \ Arabic - they will appreciate the effort...even if they laugh at you!\" I rolled\
  \ my eyes dramatically, knowing full well she could see, and assured her I have\
  \ it covered and wouldn't embarrass her.\n\n\"Yalla Umo. Show me where I come from.\"\
  \ We got into Antoon's dusty Mercedes and hit the road. Rather than attempt stifled\
  \ conversation, he turned the radio up full blast and wound the windows down so\
  \ I could observe the sights of Beirut city as we flew through. \n\nThe hypnotic\
  \ tunes of Amir Diab filled the car and I settled into my seat curious to see how\
  \ the next week would unfold."
