Text: "When I graduated from High School I went on a semester to Nice, France to learn\
  \ French.One day, a friend who was living in Valencia invited me to spend the weekend\
  \ there. I obviously said yes so I went to buy the train tickets and thought they\
  \ were pretty cheap but then I saw it was a 3 hour trip so I thought that must be\
  \ it. It turns out that I bought myself a ticket to Valence, a small city in France,\
  \ not Valencia, Spain and I realized this just one day before I was supposed to\
  \ go. I went to the train station to change the tickets to Valencia, Spain. This\
  \ time the tickets weren't cheap at all and it was a very long trip that consisted\
  \ of two trains. My first train was leaving in half an hour so I went for our suitcases\
  \ and made it. \nI was now in the second train, almost reaching the Spanish boarder\
  \ when the train stopped and the police got on the train to ask for ids. I didn't\
  \ have my passport because I sent it to the embassy of Turkey in Mexico City because\
  \ I was planning a trip to Turkey and needed a visa to go there.\nWhen the police\
  \ asked for my passport and I told them my story  they got me off the train with\
  \ other African guys who did not have their passports either. They took the African\
  \ guys in a police car and I in another. They took me to some place in the middle\
  \ of nowhere and started to question me. They said they were going to deport me\
  \ back to Mexico, I gave them my host family's phone number, the embassy's and everything\
  \ to verify the story . Obviously my story was verified by my host family, the embassy\
  \ and everything. and I was almost free to go, I just needed a signature from the\
  \ head migration something but for my bad luck, and I mean, this is really bad luck\
  \ and even looks like a bad joke. It turns out, this person from whom I needed the\
  \ signature had just had an accident skiing that morning and was at the hospital\
  \ and after an hour died, so now there was no one who could sign me the paper and\
  \ I had to wait another 5 hours untill everything was sorted out. In total, I was\
  \ there 12 hours and it was exhausting. I returned to Nice all worn out and sad\
  \ but at least I wasn't  deported. Looking back to this episode I now laugh but\
  \ it wasn't funny at all while I was living it. Getting my finger prints and being\
  \ taken front faced and profile pictures as if I were some kind of criminal, being\
  \ questioned over and over again, waiting for hours and eating some crappy food\
  \ wasn't at all how I expected to spend that weekend for sure."
