Text: "To start of with, this may be the most unusual travel story you can come across\
  \ in your lifetime. This memoir is not only speaking of my encounters, but the intense\
  \ lead-up to them, which were only cured by my travels. \n\nThe day I decided to\
  \ make my next overseas adventure to America was indeed a happy moment for me. It\
  \ was the start of an anxious wait for another exciting trip. However, my excitement\
  \ took an interesting turn, which I hate to admit, for the worse. During a walk\
  \ around my neighbourhood, I started to feel dizzy and slowly fell to the ground\
  \ against my will. I do not recall anything after I fell. By the time I woke up,\
  \ I was inside an ambulance, heading to the hospital. This could only mean one thing,\
  \ I had suffered yet another fucking seizure. This incident has put me in the position\
  \ of being dependent on other people getting me from A to B, as it was law that\
  \ if a person suffered a seizure, it meant no driving for 12 months. \nThis was\
  \ only the start to my almost fatal downfall. \n\nFor the next 6 months, I was given\
  \ new medications as trials. My immediate family members were driving me to my two\
  \ places of employment, plus taxi drivers and my boyfriend. All these combined made\
  \ me feel lost and confused with my feelings and was driving me to the edge of suicide.\
  \ I did not want to go and see a therapist but my family thought it would help me\
  \ get excited again for my trip overseas. It was a surprise, but these therapy sessions\
  \ and the weaning of the drug I was on for my epilepsy that was making me feel depressed\
  \ worked. I was ready for my adventure. \n\nThe first leg of my trip was more of\
  \ a family affair. My dad accompanied me on my exploration of Southern California.\
  \ Our trip to the happiest place on earth, the one and only Disneyland, was indeed\
  \ the happiest I had ever been since October 2015. This day also marked Dad's 56th\
  \ birthday and what better way to celebrate it was at the happiest place on earth.\
  \ 6am may be a crazy time to start opening an amusement park, but that's exactly\
  \ what time we entered. This gave us an extra hour to explore the park and get crazy\
  \ on the popular rides like the teapot spins and the merry-go-round before the rest\
  \ of the crowd poured in. I have never felt more alive at a theme park, compared\
  \ to the theme parks here in Australia. Considering Disneyland is one of the oldest\
  \ theme parks in the world, it leaves a mark for everyone who enters. They can all\
  \ say, I became a happy person today more than ever."
