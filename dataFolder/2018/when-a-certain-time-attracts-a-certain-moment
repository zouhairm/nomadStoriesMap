Text: "Three friends are lying down together in a peaceful, undisturbed field at midnight\
  \ overlooking the last lights lit within a small, Slovakian settlement below. Mystical\
  \ mountains stand tall in front, their bright, white peaks illuminated by moonlight\
  \ and behind, nocturnal beasts are awakening beneath the forest\u2019s dark green\
  \ pelage. Above, the sky is sprinkled with infinite mystery and the silhouette of\
  \ the Milky Way is so apparent, you really feel a part of everything and everything\
  \ a part of you. As we lay side by side looking above and beyond, we begin to appreciate\
  \ every past moment, which has led us to this exact moment.\nI think of the memories\
  \ that we have shared this past summer, volunteering at a Slavic-style, wooden hostel\
  \ with the High-Tatra mountains on our doorstep. I think of the many friends I have\
  \ made, the sounds of laughter and of freedom. As I slowly fall into the state of\
  \ non-thought, I am fully relaxed and in complete unity with the two other beings\
  \ beside me. I close my eyes, caressing the cool grass between my fingers. \nAs\
  \ I float further along a stream of consciousness, almost on the pinnacle of euphoria,\
  \ my eyes are suddenly open. I am abruptly awoken by a powerful, heavy tremor ascending\
  \ towards me, a force that I have never felt nor heard before. I freeze, unable\
  \ to move. Its ferocious and predatory footsteps echo through the solid surface\
  \ beneath me, like ripples in water. Carolyne begins to shout, \u201CGet back!\u201D\
  \ Instinct snaps me out of my petrification and simultaneously, Jack and I rise\
  \ together without thought. Adrenaline consumes me and we too begin to shout words\
  \ of protection and authority. My heart is filled with the rawest emotion I have\
  \ ever felt, the purest of fear.\nHe stops. He is now afraid of us.\nThe three of\
  \ us retreat, still bellowing together like the true animals we are. Realising that\
  \ our collective cries have prevailed and we are no longer in danger, we take this\
  \ moment to run as fast as we can.\nWe reach the bottom of the field and are grounded\
  \ by the safe, concrete floor of \u017Ddiar. Completely speechless and too stimulated\
  \ to stand still, we carry on walking.\nLate night dog walkers casually greet us,\
  \ completely unaware of what has just happened. We sit on a curb, all of us lost\
  \ for words. I look to Jack and then to Carolyne, we begin to laugh.\nAs the last\
  \ few drops of adrenaline leave my body, I am now back in the realm of thought with\
  \ only one thing left to say\u2026\n\u201CPeriods really do attract bears, don\u2019\
  t they?\u201D"
