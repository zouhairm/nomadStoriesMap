Text: "\u201CFace din rahat bici.\u201D Elena's frown thaws into a warm grin. \u201C\
  It means 'make whip from poo' \u2013 to make little go long way. Romanians are good\
  \ at this, we had no choice.\u201D She thrusts a mici into my numb hands. The greasy,\
  \ meaty roll is a hearty remedy for the Transylvanian winter which dissolves into\
  \ darkness outside. The train coils through the valley, away from R\xE2\u0219nov\
  \ where Elena found me, cold and lost.\n\n*\n\nA leaden haze had swept over R\xE2\
  \u0219nov, sucking the town's fortress into its dreary depths as the inky sky dumped\
  \ a barrage of snowflakes. The air's bitter rawness seized my lungs and settled\
  \ on my tongue. R\xE2\u0219nov's streets were abandoned like an apocalyptic film\
  \ set. Still, no bus and the 18km to Bra\u015Fov felt impossible.\n\n\u201CAutobuzul\
  \ nu vine acum\u201D, a voice barked from the mist. Its hoarse tone broke the silence.\
  \ \u201CBra\u0219ov Bus. Not coming.\u201D Elena's silhouette emerged from the shadow,\
  \ briskly swiping snow from her leather jacket. Her frosty stare pierced colder\
  \ than the breeze. \n\n\u201CCome, we go to gar\u0103. Train - Bra\u015Fov.\u201D\
  \ Waving me over, her arms flapped in a confused frenzy - something compelled me.\
  \ Was it her insistence, the bitter twilight or sheer curiosity? Perhaps all three.\
  \ Suddenly, I felt my legs struggling to keep up with Elena's march. Her thick black\
  \ boots stamped crater-sized footprints in the snow as we headed to the 'gar\u0103\
  .'        \n\n*\n\nThe train rambles towards Bra\u015Fov and Elena's rigid gaze\
  \ has melted into the night. Everything outside, the biting air; the torrent of\
  \ snow, is smothered by darkness. It's just Elena and I.   \n\nShe unwraps another\
  \ mici with the affection of a nurturing Grandma. I insist she keeps it for herself\
  \ as her lips spread into a genial smile. \u201CIf Ceau\u015Fescu taught Romanians\
  \ one thing, it's how to share, no matter how little.\u201D She clasps my hand around\
  \ the mici as I ask about life under the dictator. \u201CWe waited in long line\
  \ for hours, all day. Sometimes bread was all we had, for whole family. We made\
  \ that little go long way.\u201D Lost in Elena's words I miss the train jolt into\
  \ Bra\u015Fov.\n\nSuddenly, I see the value of the food Elena is sharing with me.\
  \ It becomes a testament to Romanian tenacity and above all, the kindness of its\
  \ stoic people. \n\nWhen Romania's cold front melts away you see a nation which\
  \ has survived the toughest times by uniting as one. Elena showed me how you can\
  \ triumph through challenges by putting your faith and trust in others, emerging\
  \ all the richer. As Romanians say, you can indeed 'make a whip from poo'."
