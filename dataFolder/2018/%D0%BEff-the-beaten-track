Text: "\u201CAllahu Akbar\u201D! Perhaps, I heard it in the news, but definitely not\
  \ in my everyday reality. Being a Ukrainian Orthodox Christian, I have never even\
  \ met a Muslim in my life. So when the crew of Air Arabia\u2019s aircraft turned\
  \ on the take-off prayer, I asked myself repeatedly: \u201CShould I start praying\u201D\
  ? Yet all I wanted is to see the ocean. The ocean of Sri Lanka.\n\nThe first train,\
  \ the shabby one, took us to the village of Kumarakanda. Its doors never closed\
  \ and some local guys were sitting on the stairs watching the ocean licking the\
  \ incandescent sandy beached of the ragged coastline. Sometimes, when we were getting\
  \ especially close to the water, it seemed like the waves could almost touch their\
  \ brown weather-beaten toes.\n\nSome passengers were talking loudly, some sleeping\
  \ their worries away, almost floating amidst their peers in the dense and humid\
  \ tropical midday air, yet others were selling different merchandise intrusively.\n\
  \nIn two weeks another train, clean and comfortable one, was bringing us to Kandy.\
  \ The views changed quickly - rice fields, jungles, mountains, flowering trees,\
  \ and cows, which grazed almost by the railway track. The train often went through\
  \ the small tunnels, skirting large boulders,  that sometimes were just a few centimeters\
  \ away, it seemed that any minute now, they will pull my camera away to sacrifice\
  \ to some unpronounceable deity of the local jungles...\n\nKandy, a surrounded by\
  \ hills paradise, with ancient temples, statues of Buddha, beautiful lakes and big\
  \ chubby lizards sunbathing on the shores of the local pond. Since childhood, I\
  \ collect everything with elephants - statues, pictures, clothes... For me, elephants\
  \ are the symbol of wild and kind and fabulous. So when I saw a real elephant for\
  \ the first time in my life that was walking right there through the streets of\
  \ Kandy, for a second I couldn\u2019t say a word or make a move. But then I chased\
  \ him. I thought, otherwise, I would never find out what the elephant\u2019s plans\
  \ were.\n\nIn a couple of blocks away the elephant stopped near a fountain right\
  \ at the entrance to the Temple of the Tooth and showered himself repeatedly from\
  \ his trunk, allowing people to take shots and marvel at this great animal, while\
  \ he was getting his rest after his working day. That day, for the first time since\
  \ the beginning of this crazy journey I felt childishly happy, almost blissful.\
  \ I felt a lot that I can\u2019t express without losing the big chunk of its essence,\
  \ I felt at home. That day it was true."
