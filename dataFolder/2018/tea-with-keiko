Text: "We meet at ten o'clock on Sunday at Jodo-Ji temple in Onomichi, a port on Japan\u2019\
  s inland sea. As instructed, I toss 100 yen between the wooden slats at the entrance\
  \ and prostrate myself in front of the altar. Explaining the fluidity between Buddhism\
  \ and Shinto in Japanese culture, Keiko then leads me to the nearby shrine where\
  \ we bow, clap twice so the gods hear us, bow again. This ritual done, we walk through\
  \ narrow streets until we reach an old house with dark roof tiles and an elegant\
  \ wooden gate. I remove my shoes and recall Jun\u2019ichir\u014D Tanizaki\u2019\
  s 'In Praise of Shadows' as I take in the screen doors and chiaroscuro light particular\
  \ to Japanese interiors.  \n\nKeiko sits me down in a room with rattan chairs, an\
  \ old television set and a Miffy clock, and introduces me to the ancient art of\
  \ the tea ceremony. She offers me a slice of pound cake \u2013 \u2018green tea is\
  \ bitter so first we eat sweet\u2019 \u2013 and warms a bowl with hot water, wiping\
  \ it down carefully with the slow actions prescribed by tea masters hundreds of\
  \ years ago. Next comes the matcha. The powdered tea is acid green, an almost unnatural\
  \ colour that the austerity of the wabi sabi ceramic throws into dramatic relief.\
  \ Keiko pulls out a wooden whisk and whips the tea into a foam like a barber lathering\
  \ up his brush; \u2018This is the most important part. I put my energy here.\u2019\
  \ She passes me the bowl with two hands; \u2018When you drink you bow. Hold like\
  \ this and turn out of respect for the host. Or hostess.\u2019 I do as she says\
  \ and turn the bowl clockwise before taking a sip of the thick tea, enjoying the\
  \ feeling of the glaze on my lips, the heat on my hands.\n\nAs I drink she talks\
  \ to me about energy, or ki. An artist who spent ten years in Manhattan\u2019s TriBeCa,\
  \ Keiko is also a healer and yoga teacher. She returned to Japan to look after her\
  \ late mother and now lives with her sisters, putting her energy into the house\
  \ and the people around her; \u2018You know arigat\u014D? Arigat\u014D has very\
  \ good energy. Sometimes three or four of us get together and we say ah-ree-gah-toh.\u2019\
  \ She stretches out the syllables of this simple thank you until it takes on its\
  \ own sacred meaning. \n\nThen, \u2018Showtime!\u2019; the ceremony is over and\
  \ Keiko makes strong black coffee before showing me her portfolio. We talk for a\
  \ while about the flatness of Japanese art and as she packs away her drawings she\
  \ asks where I\u2019d like to go for lunch. \u2018I leave myself in the hands of\
  \ a local,\u2019 I say, and we make our way out of the shadowy house and onto the\
  \ bright streets of Onomichi."
