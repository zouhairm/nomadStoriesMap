Text: Experiencing the parallel blue skies starting at me all around instead of looking
  upwards  made me fall in love with Ladakh instantly. Never had l ever witnessed
  my eyes and existence being so lucky to admire the valleys, lush green mountains
  the heights of the embarked between natural paradise surrounding me all over made
  me feel the depths of my soul and being which paved the way to know more and explore
  the unexplored of this gifted place Truely heaven on earth in this beautiful universe.
  The locals are so warm kind hearted and made me feel I was home from the beginning
  of our connection and interaction. Travelling along some places and having local
  food together taught me alot about their lives,culture,history And traditions.The
  live so simple with smiles glowing their face and breath of the present to refresh
  them and never worry about the next day or future.Mangur Bhai a local from ladakh
  took me to several monasteries and also was lucky to experience a congregation where
  l recieved Alot of spiritual insights about Buddhism and life in general from Dalai
  Lama.Playing with the local kids and teaching them brought me back to my childhood
  with smiles and joyous energy to fill my heart with falling in deeper love with
  this place. Sometimes it's about the people u meet along the journey which enrich
  and make the beauty of the the place more wonderful and amazing which will keep
  imprints on your life and soul for a lifetime.The majic they brought to my experience
  in these few days added spice to my journey welcoming me to their houses and sharing
  food along with them was like homecoming.Nubra valley was a dream fairytale where
  I was surrounded by desert mountains and lake on either side and the stars to gaze
  twinkling it's light on us sharing bonfire and cooking food with two locals Truely
  was an experience unforgettable.We sang and experienced the silence the moment of
  beauty had to offer. I believe it's just one life we need to be free and explore
  the depths of our travel being humble,loving And honest with the people who we meet
  and trespass along the way which leave permanent memories of cherish and smiles
  for a lifetime which teach, grow and give an unique experience to our souo which
