Text: "\u201CAiguille Petite Verte is a mountain in the Mont Blanc Massif.\u201C This\
  \ is what the all-knowing oracle - Wikipedia - will offer as an answer, if a curious\
  \ explorer looks up the creamy French words. Four years ago, before I climbed it,\
  \ I didn\u2019t care what it was and where it lied. I only cared that it is 4000-meters-high,\
  \ that it is dangerous, that it will push me to the edge \u2013 and hopefully not\
  \ over it. \nBut let me start at the beginning. \nFrance. Chamonix. Early 2010\u2019\
  s. We\u2019re prepping for the insane climb. Oriol - my all time favorite Catalan\
  \ \u2013 showing me how to make a double bowline knot. My eyes \u2013 wide open,\
  \ small clouds of fear floating in them. A bottle of Vin de Savoie and a random\
  \ combo of baguettes, a camembert and a saucisson later, we\u2019re screwing around.\
  \ Tears in our eyes from laughing. Tourists staring - we are sitting in the middle\
  \ of the commercial street. The village, absurdly posh. Oriol shouts to me, \u201E\
  You do realize that you are already thirty?\u201C I look at my clock, realize indeed\
  \ that is is already past midnight on 29th August, and shout back, \u201EWho cares!\u201C\
  \ It\u2019s quite ok to just not care about anything. \nThe next day \u2013 I care\
  \ a lot. About about the double bowline, on which my life depends and which I knotted\
  \ personally today. Can I entrust my life to myself? Tough question. No time to\
  \ think. The climb \u2013 a mess. Ahead - obscured by clouds glaciers and cliffs\
  \ and crags and rocks and ice. At the very end \u2013 for the first time ever \u2013\
  \ my heart just stops. I slip and catch the edge of the last cliff with the tips\
  \ of my cold, freezing fingers. Will the knot hold? The survivalism in me triumphs\
  \ \u2013 I make up there. No clouds. Sun. Cold. Oriol laughing. I \u2013 laughing.\
  \ Then crying, just a little. Then - I shout on the top of the world from the top\
  \ of my lungs, \u201CYou only know when you are alive, when you feel the fear in\
  \ your heart!\u201D\nGoing back - a Kinderspiel. Foggy though, feels like the breath\
  \ of Gollum on the skin. Five-six hours of walking, a wooden cabin materializes.\
  \ We enter. Jaw drops from astonishment, I stare, she\u2019s mesmerizing. Chit-chat\
  \ as fast as a Ping-Pong between her and Oriol. Damn, don\u2019t speak French. Leave.\
  \ \nHundred meters down the mountain I stop. Turn back. Look at the cabin. Turn\
  \ my head to my buddy, look deep in his eyes, look for a sign. \n\u201COriol, I\
  \ have to go back, otherwise I will regret this for the rest of my life.\u201D He\
  \ nods, smiling. \u201CGo back and talk to her, you stupid!\u201D It\u2019s quite\
  \ ok to care a lot about something."
