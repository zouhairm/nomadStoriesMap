Text: "Introduction:\n\nAnd so the thought came to me in an odoriferous manner, as\
  \ of the fashion of mysticism. Buried in my surmise about vanquishing and conquering\
  \ the earth, I said to myself, \u201Cpurpose is what changes the course of a man\u2019\
  s life, passion is what keeps him going and hope is what makes his purpose and passion\
  \ a proclivity and deportment\u201D. Because everyday, I think to myself, what a\
  \ wonderful world.\n\nI chose to travel to Benin Republic because of cultural exchange,\
  \ adventure, language, proximity, experience and to gain perspective. Which cuts\
  \ across my core value and purpose in life.\n\nBabs Dock Island :\n\nBabs Dock,\
  \ the island of enthrallment. They say, mother nature communicates, this I used\
  \ to vehemently disbelief, until my transcendental encounter with the Island of\
  \ enthralling comeliness.\n\nAnd so I got prepared and ready for the journey. My\
  \ journey to the place was very rough, maybe it is because it was via a motorbike,\
  \ so I began to have doubts as to if visiting the place was worth it.\n\nIn no time\
  \ we got there, it was required of us to travel via a boat to the island, upon hearing\
  \ this I began to develop interest in going to see Babs Dock.\n\nPaddling through\
  \ the tropical rainforest and listening to the singing birds, I felt this connection\
  \ with nature, something I cannot really explain, because a sense of calmness suddenly\
  \ descended upon me, I felt peace like a river and all around my loins. My troubled\
  \ heart melted away, and I had a free state of mind. It was a feeling, my pen and\
  \ paper cannot express and explain. That is what I refer to as the power of mother\
  \ nature.\n\nAs soon as we got to the bay, we went to a restaurant to get something\
  \ to eat, I was able to familiarize myself with Massourath (my guide), who all along,\
  \ I have been trying my best to communicate with, both in English and in French.\
  \ She kept on making fun of my French ascent, which she described to be horrible.\
  \ I must confess she is such a beauty to behold.\n\nAfter eating, we did some swinging\
  \ which was a lot of fun for me, we went to see some animals they had around, I\
  \ went boat riding, I wasn\u2019t able to swim because I was scared of the water.\n\
  \nAbove all, I had a great time at Babs Dock Island, and whenever I\u2019m opportune\
  \ to be in Cotonou again I would visit Babs dock Island again to relive the experience.\n\
  \nConclusion:\n\nAlthough I had some challenges at first, but I was able to persevere.\
  \ Afritours 2.0 was a wonderful experience for me, which I will always want to relive."
