Text: "A cold December night somewhere between Marrakech and the Sahara desert. My\
  \ friends and I are on the desperate search for beer in an Islamic country and ended\
  \ up wandering around a dark abandoned village. After two kilometers, we finally\
  \ spot a small house with an open door and dim light coming from the inside - my\
  \ friends are convinced that this must be the shop where they sell beer, simply\
  \ because Google Maps says so. We slowly approach the house and hesitantly knock\
  \ on the door. \nA man, probably in his fifties, with dark, leathery skin and a\
  \ big drunk grin on his face makes some wild gestures which we interpret as an invitation\
  \ to come in and sit down. We must be totally crazy. The \u201Chouse\u201C is no\
  \ more than a bare grey room with a small white plastic table and some chairs around\
  \ it. Our host, who only speaks Berber and a few scraps of French, introduces himself\
  \ as Anamar. He pours a transparent liquid from an old Coca Cola bottle into a dirty\
  \ glass and we all take a polite sip - it tastes like there is at least 90 percent\
  \ alcohol in it. Our host disappears, mumbling some incomprehensible words like\
  \ \u201Evoisin, il parle Anglais\u201C. A moment later, a man in his twenties wearing\
  \ a turban and holding an iPad in his hands enters the room. Well, this is how the\
  \ party started. The only song on the device: Madonna\u2019s hit Frozen to which\
  \ we will be dancing in a loop for the next few hours.\n\nHow can life be what you\
  \ want it to be\nYou're frozen\nWhen your heart's not open.\n\nEvery few minutes\
  \ new neighbours flock into the tiny room. Soon it feels like the whole village\
  \ is crammed in Anamar\u2019s home and everybody seems to know that he received\
  \ unexpected guests from another country. We talk, drink, smoke, dance and laugh\
  \ together. We laugh a lot. Goodness, if my Mum knew that I was the only woman at\
  \ a party in the middle of the Moroccan nowhere smoking hookah, dancing with Berber\
  \ men and drinking dubios alcoholic beverages out of insanitary glasses, she would\
  \ definitely have gotten a heart attack. \n\nMadonna keeps singing her song over\
  \ and over again and suddenly it all makes sense. How can life be what you want\
  \ it to be when your heart\u2019s not open? We may live in different cultures and\
  \ our traditions and believes may be entirely different. We don\u2019t speak the\
  \ same language, but we don\u2019t need to. That cold December night in Morocco,\
  \ we opened our hearts, sent a smile and got back a lot more. Madonna was so damn\
  \ right back in 1998. Aren\u2019t we all nomads at heart?"
