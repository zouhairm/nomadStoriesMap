Text: "Since child I have been the one to always be scared of heights, adventure and\
  \ being in a group all that due to my size. I have always been over weight. I tried\
  \ so many diets and exercise classes but getting to 18 make me realise that\u2019\
  s not the life I wanted. I\u2019m from Mauritius and the island is full of hidden\
  \ gems, so I decided to start a different lifestyle, I pushed myself to the limit,\
  \ i change my group of friends, i started going out more to places, i discover hiking\
  \ and how it\u2019s breath taking when you reach the summit of a mountain, Mauritius\
  \ is full of mountains, sea and waterfalls, so I made myself an objectives to at\
  \ least go explore a mountain or waterfall once a month. Mauritius-explore is a\
  \ social media group that allow you to be part of a community, saying this it means\
  \ that you can book trips with locals to go to places or even share your experience\
  \ with locals and tourists. There\u2019s so many more groups. Some focus on healthy\
  \ walks and hike, others are into extreme sport but most of them are to discover\
  \ our paradise island and to make friends. This experience has change me for the\
  \ best.  I don\u2019t regret changing my lifestyle and I\u2019m so glad I join these\
  \ groups as I now have lots of friends and acquaintances and a head full of memories\
  \ that is to be shared.\n\nI started small where I hike \u201Cle pouce\u201D mountain,\
  \ this was a hell of a ride, I wasn\u2019t prepared mentally, I didn\u2019t have\
  \ the gear needed and all I wanted is to try. After 3 hours of struggle I made it\
  \ to the top and OMG the view of the capital and the surrounding was amazing, no\
  \ words to express how I feel and all pain and exhaustion vanished. This feeling\
  \ of being on top and breathing to fresh air is surnaturel. From there the month\
  \ after we went to climb a waterfall, the pressure of the water falling make you\
  \ realise thats how you should be living life, fearless and without regrets. Saying\
  \ that, with all the courage I have i jumped into the crystal clear water. And that\
  \ was it for me. R\xE9alisation kick in that this is what I want to do now. This\
  \ is me, this is what I need to resource, I want to travel and explore places like\
  \ this, where the water is clear and refreshing, where the mountains are high and\
  \ challenging, where the people are nice and generous and where we can make it a\
  \ community. \n\nNothing can compare to this experience and How my love for travel\
  \ started. The needs to discover things and explore."
