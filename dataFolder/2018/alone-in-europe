Text: "Have you ever been in situation when you absolutely alone in a foreign city\
  \ and you completely do not know what to do? I have been once. My first day of traveling\
  \ was unforgettable...\n2 years ago when I was 19, me and my three friends decided\
  \ to make a little journey around the Europe. We bought tickets and started to prepare\
  \ to our journey. It was the first and the longest travel for me for that period\
  \ of my life. \nFirst step of our trip was one of the most popular city in the world\
  \ - Paris. We came there on the one April night and this city was so big and crowded\
  \ for four young ladies who have never been before in an any big city. Those night\
  \ in Paris was fatal, because my addiction of traveling was born in this beautiful\
  \ time. \nBut I would like to tell you about my first morning in the city of love.\
  \ This morning wasn\u2019t so happy and my mood became bad. The reason was expected:\
  \ I have lost in the capital of France. I was alone and did not know how I can manage\
  \ this strange situation. I was walking along wide beautiful streets and tried to\
  \ figure out where I can find the internet to connect with my friends. I found a\
  \ subway and tried to ask people, how can I get to the Eifel tower. Nobody answered\
  \ me, because they didn\u2019t speak English. Finally I found a map and choosed\
  \ the nearest station to the Eifel tower. I got there and after 3 hours of searching\
  \ I found my friends. \nThat was really difficult and I can\u2019t even describe\
  \ all feelings I feld but I am happy that everything ended without any problems.\
  \ And this situation did not stop me, and I still searching and use any chance to\
  \ travel and to wide my mind"
