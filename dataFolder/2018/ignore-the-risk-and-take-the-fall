Text: "An hug. A smile. First greetings to say. Flood of words to pronounce but only\
  \ silences to hear.\nAre temporary farewells the ones you say. To relatives, to\
  \ the ones you care about. To those friends that have seen you grow up or those\
  \ that grow up with you. Lots of tears. Lots of recommendations to hear. You have\
  \ just said goodbye to your grandparents. A little bit worried for you, but they've\
  \ got used to see you go toward the world by now. Happy and proud of you, or however\
  \ of the way you are growing.\nHugs loaded with affection. Smiles that say \"Go\
  \ and take the world\".\nYou have said goodbye to your uncle when he went back to\
  \ Tenerife. He was the one you have seen go travel the globe when you was just a\
  \ child. The one that makes you think \"When I grow up, I will see a lot of places\
  \ like he did.\"\nBut now it's your moment. You leave. Really. You're leaving.\n\
  An infinite number of emotions overwhelm you. Anxiety and serenity. Sadness and\
  \ delight. Fear and bravery. You're ready and not.\_\nYou still have to say goodbye\
  \ to two person.\_Tears rain down. Hugs pierce the bones and move the hearts.There's\
  \ time. But it passes quickly.You're always their daughter and you'll be forever.\
  \ Thanks to them you are there now and you are ready. Ready to leave. You think\
  \ to be invincible, but you feel lot of fear, too.\nYou are ready to leave everything,\
  \ to start again, to test yourself. So you smile dimly. The last goodbye. It's time\
  \ to go.\_\nA tear.This time it's for you.You have believed in yourself and you\
  \ are there now, in the place you have wanted to be, tomorrow you'll be at the airport.\
  \ Destination: Amsterdam. You are certain that to leave has been the best decision\
  \ you ever made.\_You know that this year will forever change your life and then,\
  \ during the first night in your new country you see her. You even woke up at 4:20\
  \ a.m. to see an event that takes place every 18 years, to look at the red moon.\
  \ It is surreal, a shooting star appears to say: \u201CMake a wish\u201D. And then,\
  \ there it is, the moon, that remembers you the story of Ciaula, who used to work\
  \ on a mine and discovered the moon for the first time on a summer night. It was\
  \ there, big and calm. But tonight it is wearing an evening dress. It is red, nor\
  \ gaudy nor gloomy. It has the perfect colour for that magic night. The sight of\
  \ the sky may make you feel little and worthless but at the same time alive and\
  \ part of something greater than you. You know it\u2019s the same show Van Gogh\
  \ saw when he painted your favourite painting."
