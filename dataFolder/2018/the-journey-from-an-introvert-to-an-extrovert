Text: "\u201CBe the change you wish to see in the world.\u201D -Gandhi\nIt all started\
  \ when my best friend introduced me to an organisation called AIESEC. I was not\
  \ so intrigued, then magic happened.\n\nI was in a zone where challenging myself\
  \ was not an option. Having to go through interviews and selections was not my thing.\
  \ No one likes filling in applications and going to interviews. I filled in the\
  \ application and did the interview and passed it. I was somehow shocked and proud\
  \ of myself simultaneously. I had achieved something and had finally broken out\
  \ of my comfort zone.\n\nIt was such a relief to me when I was done with the interview.\
  \ The next step was as important as the first one, as I had to choose a project\
  \ in a country of my choice. And let me tell you, having to choose one country out\
  \ of hundreds was not an easy job. I wanted to visit them all. I ended up choosing\
  \ India and that was when the magic started to happen.\n\nAfter doing all of the\
  \ paperwork and taking care of my visa, it was the time for me to go to a different\
  \ country, on a different continent. I arrived at the airport in India and I met\
  \ a nice, smiling man who asked me whether I was Marwa. He was my driver.\n\nI settled\
  \ down and met my flatmates, people from different countries and with different\
  \ backgrounds. They left a mark on my life. I could call them my second family,\
  \ a family I would not forget for the rest of my life. People who taught me that\
  \ I would never be completely at home again because part of my heart would always\
  \ be elsewhere. I will gladly pay the price of loving and knowing people in more\
  \ than one place.\n\nThe project I was working on was an educational one. The first\
  \ day at work was not as easy as I imagined. The kids were between five and nine\
  \ years old and they could not understand me, nor could I understand them, and that\
  \ was challenging. I had to teach them English and was determined to do it for I\
  \ wished to have an impact on their lives even if it was going to be a small one.\
  \ I did it eventually, after many attempts and failures.\n\nThose kids taught me\
  \ a lot in return. They taught me never to give up, to keep trying until I get what\
  \ I want or be where I want. They taught me that nothing was impossible. They also\
  \ showed me how to be happy with the little I had, that money is not everything\
  \ and that it does not buy happiness. No matter how hard their lives get, they will\
  \ always be happy and grateful. They taught me the real value of simplicity and\
  \ left a huge mark on my life."
