Text: "Three months into our Pan-American overland adventure we were desperate. I\
  \ never expected it would be this hard to escape the the clutches of Panamanian\
  \ bureaucracy. \n\nWith over 50 pages of official export paperwork in hand, copied\
  \ in triple, we had been refused exit by two separate border crossings in 24 hours.\
  \ One of the official export documents was set to expire, we\u2019d run out of funds,\
  \ and we were continuously reminded that we were missing a pink slip. Did I mention\
  \ we\u2019d also somehow managed to have our passports stamped like we\u2019d exited\
  \ the country? \nOriginally, the plan was straightforward. Fly into Panama, find\
  \ a badass diesel adventure-mobile, complete simple export procedures, and begin\
  \ the road trip of a lifetime back  to Canada. \nDon\u2019t get me wrong, we\u2019\
  d done our research beforehand, but we also hadn\u2019t come to grips with our engine\
  \ blowing up on the side of the Pan-American outside of Panama City. It also wasn\u2019\
  t apparent from the hours of research, that non-Panamanian citizens weren\u2019\
  t technically allowed to export a Panamanian vehicle. That only became evident at\
  \ border crossing number two. Hence the missing pink slip.\nAfter drowning our woes\
  \ in a bottle of whiskey in Davos, we made one final attempt to get out of Panama\
  \ the following morning. This was attempt number three in less than 36 hours. We\
  \ had little hope left of making an actual crossing, but at the very least we needed\
  \ to correct the passport situation. If we couldn\u2019t export our truck, the other\
  \ alternative at this point was setting Pablo, our Panamanian vehicle, on fire and\
  \ pushing him off a cliff. \nWithin five minutes of discussion with the newest border\
  \ official, he shut us down again. Not unfairly, he didn\u2019t want to deal with\
  \ our broken Spanish and our increasingly nightmarish stack of paperwork. Once again,\
  \ we were reminded of this mysterious but essential pink slip. Without it, we could\
  \ not pass.\nThis was a 3rd heart-wrenching rejection. Life in the border town continued\
  \ swirling around us; we felt utterly defeated. Lost in the chaos, one eager entrepreneur\
  \ picked up our scent. I\u2019m sure in his line of work; he was well accustomed\
  \ to forlorn travellers facing rejection.\nAt the end of our two months in Panama,\
  \ our 50 pages of documents, and thousands of dollars in expenses, it took a measly\
  \ $250 cold hard cash and one fixer to make this border crossing happen. Just drive\
  \ it across he said, nobody will notice. Costa Rica, it turns out, didn\u2019t care\
  \ about the missing pink slip."
