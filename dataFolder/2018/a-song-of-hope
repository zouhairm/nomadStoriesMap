Text: "My biggest dream in life had come true: I was volunteering in the breathtaking\
  \ continent of Africa! After having lived one year in South Africa, I had experienced\
  \ unforgettable moments which had changed me completely. However, little did I know\
  \ that I was still going to live one of the most inspiring days of my life.\nThose\
  \ were my first days in the crowded city of Jinja, located by Lake Victoria, South\
  \ of Uganda. The city\u2019s rural dry roads were full of banana and jack fruit\
  \ trees. The children were playing, running and caring heavy jars. One of them,\
  \ together with her family, would deeply touch my heart that day. She had a powerful\
  \ name, Adonai, along with a story worth to be heard. \nI got the chance to talk\
  \ to her mother, who received me with a smile in her tiny house. There was no furniture\
  \ around but she laid down a well-worn sheet on the red ground floor, where I sat\
  \ with her. She told me with joy and a thankful heart her 10 year-old daughter\u2019\
  s story: Adonai had lost her father when she was very young and since then her mother\
  \ had been struggling to feed her and her siblings. Although facing prejudice, illness,\
  \ lacking food and other supplies, Adonai never gave up faith, hope and appreciation\
  \ for life. She was a brave, intelligent and full of hope little girl.\nIn Uganda,\
  \ where education is of so difficult access for thousands of children, Adonai was\
  \ supported by a Foster Family program and fortunately she could go to school with\
  \ her older siblings. On a beautiful sunny day of January 2016, she came with her\
  \ family to the Foster Family party where the families were celebrating together.\
  \ With her mother and siblings, in a very emotional way, they sang a beautiful song:\
  \ \u201CBecause He lives, I can pay my school fees. Because He lives, all fear is\
  \ gone\u2026\u201D\nWhile she was singing she not just moved my heart, she taught\
  \ me what having faith really should be like: singing, rejoicing and having hope\
  \ for the future even in the most difficult days. Having a reason to be thankful\
  \ for what some take for granted, seeing beauty in the darkest places. \nIt\u2019\
  s been 3 years since that day but that memory still touches me. Whenever I\u2019\
  m lacking in hope, I close my eyes and remember her face, her story and that beautiful\
  \ song, a song of hope. That makes me wish that one day we will meet again in a\
  \ better place. A better Uganda, where every children will have a the opportunity\
  \ to have access to education and with that, a chance to a better life."
