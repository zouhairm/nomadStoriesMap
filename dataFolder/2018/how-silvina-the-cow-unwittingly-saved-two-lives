Text: "Plop. Your left foot sinks into the by now too familiar pungent mass of cow\
  \ dung. A sudden westerly gale grates past you and blows the sun further down beyond\
  \ the horizon. Days in the Balkan always end too soon, leaving the absent-minded\
  \ tourist in unexpected spots at unreasonable hours. Here you are, cold and lost,\
  \ tripping over dark mounds of animal droppings strewn far and wide across what\
  \ must, by daylight, be a sightly alpine pasture. It seems almost unreal that only\
  \ a couple of hours ago your companion, Chris, was mopping up a sweat-beaded forehead\
  \ along the steep winding path to Mount Botev: the literal and figurative crown\
  \ of the Balkan Range with a gorgeous 100-metre-long garland of water spurting off\
  \ its jagged vertical edge.\nYou dream on about past glories until another squishy\
  \ plop and Chris' voice shake you back to the immediate reality. \n\u201CLook! Over\
  \ there!\u201D Chris points at a long indistinct shape in the murky distance. \u201C\
  A fence!\u201D\nYou make your way towards the fence laboriously, hands outstretched\
  \ in the dark, and are just about to grasp the wire, when a terrifying bellow rumbles\
  \ through the night:\n\u201CStooop! Get back! Now!\u201D\nA large countryside man\
  \ is running towards you shouting about currents and voltages and what to your incredulous\
  \ ears sounds like\u2026 fried bacon?! A hurried anxious exchange makes it clear\
  \ that Uncle Georgi has come out in the night to look for his stray cow, Silvina.\
  \ The most milk-yielding animal in the herd and his all-round favourite, Silvina\
  \ went missing in the afternoon causing her beloved master to jump in frantic search\
  \ of her. \nYou, on your part, tell him of how you were climbing down from Mount\
  \ Botev and the Heavenly Falls but lost your way (and your excrement proximity radar,\
  \ apparently) right about dusk. Uncle Georgi tuts his tongue sympathetically at\
  \ your account, then he sighs and offers to drive you to the village in his \u2018\
  turtle-shell\u2019. The car, a veritable turtle-shell with its low flattish roof,\
  \ creaks indignantly, bouncing up and down across the dry ruts. At the gate to your\
  \ lodgings you thank your saviour heartily and ask him what he is going to do about\
  \ the lost Silvina.\n\u201CAh, not to worry, not to worry,\u201D Uncle Georgi waves\
  \ you off with a polite smile. \u201CAnimals are far better survivors in the wilderness\
  \ than we people are.\u201D\nUncle Georgi trundles off in his turtle-shell. Your\
  \ mind clings on to his last words, half-tenaciously, half-desperately, as a blood-curdling\
  \ howl resounds through the chilly Balkan night."
