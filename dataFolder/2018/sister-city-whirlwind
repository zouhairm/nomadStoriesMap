Text: "An 8x11 paper flyer in hand of a fifth grader can be a lethal weapon for an\
  \ unarmed parent sitting at home after a long day at work. As I round the corner\
  \ for home, paper in hand, I remember telling my parents it was only $2,000 to stay\
  \ in Japan for two weeks with a host family. With few questions asked, they told\
  \ me to apply. My little hands and big dream didn't quite grasp the sister city\
  \ concept but as the process unfolded, the origin became more clear.\_\n\_\nDes\
  \ Moines, Iowa and Kofu Yamanashi - Ken, Japan became sister cities in 1964 to create\
  \ a mutual understanding in economics and culture. Because of this sister city agreement,\
  \ young adults have the opportunity to submit essay questions which would decide\
  \ their acceptance and venture abroad. This was a relatively intimidating feat for\
  \ me so I sought guidance from a man who experienced the reasoning behind such a\
  \ partnership, my grandpa. I sat at his feet as he rocked in his maroon LAZ Boy\
  \ and extracted knowledge from his trips back in the 60s throughout his time in\
  \ his service.\_His kind smile and\_encouraging words gave me perspective that allowed\
  \ me to complete the application.\_\n\nAfter submission, I waited years in kid time\
  \ which was probably a few months. Eyes wide upon acceptance, my Saturdays were\
  \ soon filled with Japanese cultural classes. We learned characters, common phrases,\
  \ and how to properly use chopsticks; first with popcorn and then graduating to\
  \ rice. My world was slowly expanding, I felt it then but it would take years to\
  \ fully understand just how it would impact my life.\n\_\nJet set to Japan, my red\
  \ leather bound journal gifted to me from a Pre K teacher and tasked to write in\
  \ on behalf of my fifth grade teacher, I began to fill the pages with sparkly blue\
  \ gel ink. Reminiscing, there are details that didn't make the cut for my fifth\
  \ grade self and what was important in her world. However, reading through the sparkle\
  \ of pages was a gleam of something more than a trendy pen. There was a food key\
  \ of new experiences tried and documented, host family bonding through 7 Eleven\
  \ bike rides, and concocting aluminum hats iconic in the movie \"Signs.\" Most importantly,\
  \ the goosebumps that arose 14 years later reading, \"I want to come back next year.\"\
  \ Although Japan is somewhere yet to be revisited, it lit a fire in me that still\
  \ burns, an itch in my feet that I may never find true relief. As a fifth grader,\
  \ that is the last thing I expected."
