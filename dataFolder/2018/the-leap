Text: "I sat in my office looking out of the window on the 50th floor, wondering how\
  \ it felt to be out there in the open sky. I spent most of my life sitting in my\
  \ office day in and day out trying to make my life work for me. As the work pressure\
  \ build up, The desire to live my dreams flared up even higher ; even the Day Dreams\
  \ haunted me to live the life I wanted to live.\n    Since I have always been an\
  \ ambitious person, I have not hopped around much , giving in way too much to the\
  \ ambitions leaving only minute spaces for life and dreams. So that\u2019s when\
  \ I decided to take a leave from my work, my responsibilities, my feared thoughts\
  \ and decided to dive into the sea of possibilities, having faith that just as I\
  \ was taken care of in my mother\u2019s womb without my own conscious effort, my\
  \ after birth life , would also be taken care of. I decided to SkyDive.\nIt was\
  \ a bit difficult to get myself out of the comfort zone and sign the waiver taking\
  \ the responsibility of any turn of events, my Life. The instructor gave away the\
  \ skydiving skills in just 5 minutes. All of my life depended on that 5 minute lesson.\
  \ The plane flew us at 10000 ft. All suited, I stood up at the edge of the aircraft\
  \ door about to take the leap. Not knowing whether to jump straight away or take\
  \ the leap of faith , I gasped for breath And remembered this was the gasp of breath,\
  \ of new experience that I craved in my routine. The instructor counted down and\
  \ we jumped. Within seconds my doubts cleared and a breeze of calmness took over.\
  \ The vastness made me open me to all of the life. This freefall was what I needed\
  \ to experience freedom in my life. Seconds later the instructor pulled the string\
  \ that was binding our life together. Body drenched with calmness and mind so empty\
  \ we reached the ground. This looked so overwhelming at first but later I could\
  \ not thank myself enough for having the courage to do it. The experience was so\
  \ satisfying that I pledged to keep doing over and over, bringing  myself to edge\
  \ unti I become so open that it doesn\u2019t scare me anymore."
