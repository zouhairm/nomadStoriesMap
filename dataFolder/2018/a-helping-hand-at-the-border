Text: "After nine days in the bustling city of Beijing, I decided to head to Mongolia's\
  \ capital for a change, in the cheapest way possible. It wasn\u2019t too hard to\
  \ find out that I had to take an overnight bus to Zamiin Udd in Mongolian border\
  \ and then catch another overnight train to Ulan Bator upon a few hours of expected\
  \ arrival time in Zamiin Udd. So off I go; I packed my bag, bought the ticket and\
  \ get comfy on my seat in the double decker bus. I was the only foreigner in the\
  \ bus full of Mongolian that came to Beijing for shopping. Despite the language\
  \ barrier, I managed to get to know a business lady, Tuya that sat next to me. Little\
  \ did I know that other than the bumpy long ride in the November cold, there\u2019\
  s more waiting for me. \n\nAfter an exhausting sleepless night in the bus, I was\
  \ happily flashing my passport for a stamp, and the excitement of stepping foot\
  \ into the Gobi desert keeps me awake and functioning. However, the officer frowned\
  \ and I found myself in an office not long after, with a stern female officer giving\
  \ me order to open up my backpack and sit down. Terrified, I obeyed. The chinese\
  \ woman went through my backpack, flipped through my book and diary, and later,\
  \ had my phone unlocked and went through my phone while I sat in the chair with\
  \ a thousand thoughts going through my mind. What do they want? What if the bus\
  \ leave without me? What if I miss my train? Lucky for me, the bus driver waited\
  \ for me. I hopped onto the bus, weary and mentally exhausted. I no longer care\
  \ if I can catch the last train to Ulan Bator.\n\nA wide bitumen highway slowly\
  \ disappear into the vast emptiness of Gobi desert as the bus engine roar, and to\
  \ my surprise, the business lady that sat next to me in the bus helped me in the\
  \ Mongolian custom, telling me which land to queue or where to wait, all by sign\
  \ language. At this point I was morally dejected but her kindness touched me. And\
  \ that is not all. Upon arriving the bus stop, she told me to leave my backpack\
  \ under her care and go straight to the train station to get my ticket, that I still\
  \ have time. She had a Mongolian gentleman literally running to the train station\
  \ with me which is just 200m away because nobody speak English in Zamiin Udd, and\
  \ I got my ticket to for last train. To me, this is more than just a helping hand.\
  \ This is humanity. I had lost contact with Tuya, but I hope one day I could thank\
  \ her personally for all she did for me."
