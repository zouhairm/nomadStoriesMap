Text: "I consciously write down: \u201CNdizokukhumbula, ndiyakuthanda mhlobo wam\"\
  . Many times did I say the words quietly to myself with the woman in mind who once\
  \ said them to me through wet eyes.\n\nThe further I travelled towards the place\
  \ called Lubanzi the more I wondered what I was putting myself into: from Johannesburg\
  \ I flew to East London, took a bus to Umthatha, a minibus to Kwaimaan and was finally\
  \ picked up by my boss. During the ride I was overwhelmed by all the cows along\
  \ the road, the people carrying buckets on their heads and the little round houses\
  \ covered in bright colours. Green hills, sunshine and above all: a deep blue ocean.\
  \ \nThree weeks later, I was crossing those hills with Babalwa. Summer was about\
  \ to come: The winds got warmer and the air heated up quickly in the morning. The\
  \ more time I spent with the Xhosa woman, the more I realized that I would miss\
  \ her most. \u201CYou are a true friend, do you know that?\u201D\n\u201COh, you\
  \ so cute, Lena!\u201D Babalwa smiled at me. While just being colleagues first,\
  \ we became friends during the hours of walking in the field as we visited local\
  \ families for our NGO. \n\u201CTell me: What is Germany like?\u201D \n\u201CWell,\
  \ there are lots of cars and buses. Most families are much smaller than Xhosa ones.\
  \ Life in Germany is very busy, many people work hard. Not everybody can speak English\
  \ very well, most of the older generations don\u2019t at all.\u201D \nShe smiled\
  \ at me, \u201CThat's so interesting!\u201D \nBetween all our talks we laughed a\
  \ lot and shared iqwinia, fried dough. With kind permission I took pictures of the\
  \ lives we visited and the longer I stayed the less I wanted to leave. \n\u201C\
  Ndizokukhumbula, ndiyakuthanda mhlobo wam.\u201D\n\u201CAndiqondi sisi.\u201D \n\
  \u201CI said I will remember you, my friend. Don't forget: I love you Lena.\u201D\
  \ \n\u201COh, Babalwa, I love you too.\u201D Tears were rolling down my cheeks as\
  \ we hugged each other tightly. \n\u201CI don\u2019t want to go, I\u2019ll miss\
  \ you too much.\u201D \n\u201CDon\u2019t cry, sisi. You can come back again.\u201D\
  \n\nWhile I packed my backpack I was still thinking of our farewell. Hamba kakuhle,\
  \ Babalwa. In that moment I realized that South Africa had least expectedly caused\
  \ a deep longing, even before I left the country. A longing for the friendly people,\
  \ Babalwa\u2019s smile, the whales, lonely beaches, deep blue ocean, amaqwinia and\
  \ African rhythms. The perception came as a surprise since I had thought I had lost\
  \ my heart to New Zealand, not leaving room for another country. But indeed, next\
  \ to Babalwa\u2019s touching words in my diary I wrote in big, ornate letters \"\
  longing\"."
