Text: "Life can change in an instant. Yet, life-threating events were not part of\
  \ my trip planning. \nSomehow, my last night in Buenos Aires was premonitory. \n\
  \"Write what I should do with your belongings in case something happens\" - my sister\
  \ said. \n\"The ToDo list for my 2.5 years study trip to Japan does not include\
  \ a testament\" - I answered. \nJapan is one of the safest countries in the world.\
  \ My trip was full of fantastic experiences due to Japan's rich culture, generous\
  \ people and beautiful landscapes.\nBut, the improvised testament was an ill omen.\
  \ In the first month, I had unwanted encounters with mafia, stalkers, and exotic\
  \ scary bugs falling on my head. A year later I got influenza A. \nIt was March\
  \ 11th, 2011. My brother was arriving at 5PM from Sydney. The last thing I expected\
  \ was Tohoku earthquake.    \nI was on the 13th floor of Tokyo International Exchange\
  \ Center residence B.\nTIEC residences offer home to 630 single students and 110\
  \ families. It is situated in Odaiba, a large artificial island in Tokyo Bay. \n\
  It was 2:46PM when I heard it. I was doing my makeup, almost ready to leave for\
  \ the airport. \nConstructions make noises while moving to tolerate earthquakes.\
  \ Being on the 13th floor of a man-made island means that my feet were often on\
  \ shaky grounds. I was used to wake up in the middle of the night with the noises\
  \ that, to me, sounded like the roar of a lion. \nThat day was different. The roar\
  \ was louder than others. I could barely maintain my balance. And most of the stuff\
  \ in the shelves was flying across the room before reaching the floor. I was scared\
  \ and left my room. \nFour neighbors were in the corridor. The girl beside my door\
  \ was holding the latch until the metal bar got broken. \nWe hugged each other and\
  \ went down the stairs in a coordinated movement. We met with others at the central\
  \ square in the middle of TIEC residences. \nAt that moment, I contemplated my naked\
  \ feet and my right hand strongly grabbing the makeup bottle. \nOdaiba connection\
  \ to mainland was soon closed. Communication networks were collapsed. The food store\
  \ was open. \nResidents and some disoriented commuters, who were trapped in the\
  \ island, spent the night at TIEC's common facilities located at the ground. A sort\
  \ of wordless agreement decided that a life-threatening tsunami was less frightening\
  \ than staying in our rooms under constant aftershocks. \nIt was near midnight and\
  \ my brother called me. His plane landed in Osaka. The bullet train brought him\
  \ to Tokyo the next day."
