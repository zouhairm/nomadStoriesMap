Text: "THE ANTIQUE FORK\n\nIt was a hot summer afternoon on my forth day in the Eternal\
  \ City. And my first solo trip outside of my country. I was rigid and unsure. I\
  \ was hungry but directionless\u2026 in many ways. Until I started traveling solo,\
  \ I remember being pretty cynical about people and life in general. Meeting folks\
  \ from different corners of the world opened my mind to the glory of our race.\n\
  \nAs I strolled through the narrow cobbled streets of Trastevere, I spotted a homely\
  \ osteria in one quaint corner of this Jewish-Syrian quarter of Rome. A stout elderly\
  \ woman in floral dress and yellow-white checkered apron was waltzing by the tables,\
  \ while Bruno Martino played in the background. She looked happy; like that was\
  \ the only way she knew of being. To me, she was \u2018La Bella Figura\u2019. To\
  \ me, she was the Italy I was waiting to explore.\n\nIn that moment, Osteria Bocca\
  \ looked quite surreal. The elegant woman of zeal, her purring white cat, the immaculately\
  \ laid table, pretty bronze lamps covered in green patina, the fuchsia bougainvillaea\
  \ and the distant church bells - I was smitten with the details in a single frame.\
  \ I was woken out of my reverie with gentle tap on my shoulder. My order of ravioli\
  \ had arrived and she took an extra effort to inform about those creamy packets\
  \ of buratta and ricotta with pistachio, basil pesto and pine nuts. In my first\
  \ bite, as my senses exploded, I wasn\u2019t sure why it reminded me of home. She\
  \ stood there amused as I gorged on my food feeling absolutely blissful. \n\n\u201C\
  Tutto bene?\u201D she asked. \n\n\u201CSi si\u201D, I replied awkwardly. \n\nAfter\
  \ a while when I was finishing my meal, she came back to me with serenity of La\
  \ Pieta, speaking to me in poetic Italian and I, replied in broken. We seemed to\
  \ hit it off tout d\u2019suit, like we\u2019d known each other forever. Her eyes\
  \ sparkled as our conversation progressed from one story to another. She was half\
  \ Italian and half Portuguese, she told me. One of her ancestors was part of Vasco\
  \ Da Gama voyage to India and he introduced cardamom to the family. Her family had\
  \ always used that spice in the pasta, the one I\u2019d just gobbled down. No wonder,\
  \ I tasted familiarity. Boy, I was let into a family secret and our bond was mysteriously\
  \ sealed. I finished that meal with affogato, a little jig\_and a long hug.\_I knew\
  \ I\u2019d sown a seed of borderless love.  \n\nIt\u2019s been eleven years since\
  \ I met Signora Livia. Whenever I get doubtful about humanity, I just hold close\
  \ the antique fork gave me as a parting gift. It restores my faith back in human\
  \ interconnectedness."
