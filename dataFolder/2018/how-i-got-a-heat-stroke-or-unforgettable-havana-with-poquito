Text: "After 1 hour of waiting for our excursion and drinking strong Cuban coffee\
  \ at 8 am in the lobby of our hotel we started to have doubts if anyone is coming\
  \ for the 3 of us at all. \n``Cuba Time`` is something Cubans say when they are\
  \ late and so our driver said just that much.\nI happened to have the privilege\
  \ to sit at the front and ask questions:\n-  What\u2019s your name?\n-  Call me\
  \ Poquito.\n-  Doesn\u2019t poquito means small in Spanish?\n-  Aaaa, no. If your\
  \ dad is Frank and you are Frank that means you are Poquito Frank, comprende?\n\
  -  Oh, comprende. You mean like Junior?\nPoquito is not only going to be our driver\
  \ and guide but also a stand-up comedian.\nWe were rolling through green areas of\
  \ country pretty fast.\n- Hey Poquito, what is the average salary in Cuba?\n- 20\
  \ USD per month. Doctor makes 40 USD.\n- And how much do you make? \n- I make more\
  \ than a doctor! See, I have Ray-Bans. \nWide smile appeared on his well-rounded\
  \ mid age face.\nThe weather was in higher 30`s Celsius on this late April day.\
  \ I could feel drops of sweat rolling down my back.\n- Poquito, do you have the\
  \ AC?\n- Roll down all windows, that\u2019s my AC.\n- Then at least make music louder.\
  \ How old is this Chevrolet with no seat belts anyways?\n- 1957 model, I saved money\
  \ and got a new engine now.\n- Holy, and how old is that jeep over there?\n- 1929.\n\
  After this shocking number we all agreed that jeep appearance didn\u2019t change\
  \ much since the 30\u2019s.\n- Where are you guys from?\n- Canada.\n- Oh, I want\
  \ to go there, it\u2019s a dream.\n- And we want to come here. Too cold in Canada,\
  \ Poquito, trust me you don\u2019t want to go there.\nWe asked him a lot of questions\
  \ about Cuban regime. He said government is the biggest mafia and he kept repeating:\
  \ ``Remember, it`s Cuba? Crazy country!``.\nHe really encouraged us with motivational\
  \ speeches such as: ``You didn\u2019t come to Cuba to drink water and you didn\u2019\
  t come to Cuba to sleep, did you?! Party and enjoy the beach and enjoy your life!``\n\
  I really think this sunny weather has a lot to do with positive mentality of its\
  \ people.\nWe walked through squares and brick roads, smelling a mixture of sweat,\
  \ cigars and blooming flowers that cover cracks of old buildings.\nThere was extremely\
  \ hot and exhaustively exciting day of sightseeing ahead with stocking up on cheap\
  \ rum and cigars.\nPoquito was so proud that Fast and Furious 8 got filmed in Havana.\
  \ \nFew months later I will watch this movie and with incredible and somehow childish\
  \ excitement say: I have been there, I have been there with Poquito!"
