Text: "Scattered the beach and boardwalk for a decent place to lay out our blanket.\
  \ Took longer than expected. I figured the local would already have a spot in mind,\
  \ but much to my surprise he was almost just as lost as I. The fact made evident\
  \ once he finally chose a spot only to then shine his light on a homeless man tucked\
  \ away in his third dream. Locals never really roam this area much he later explained.\n\
  \n\nIt was late night, more like early morning. Well aware that the sun would wake\
  \ soon. We didn't have much time, my flight set to send me home at sunrise. This\
  \ was his gesture for our last romantic encounter. I'd have to admit, I was smitten.\
  \ Every traveling girl\u2019s dream is to fall in love on vacation. \n\n\nMalcolm\
  \ opened up about his severe back injury that kept him from playing professional\
  \ soccer, his dream. How he got mixed in this illegal side gig to save up some money.\
  \ Of which he knew I did not approve of. He went on about his hopes and dreams for\
  \ the future. On how many kids he'd always wanted to have. He explained that it\
  \ was hard to make a living on the island. That everything was overpriced and locals\
  \ normally fled to either England or Canada. He lived in England for two years,\
  \ but it was too cold. Asked me if he needed a visa to visit me in Puerto Rico.\
  \ That I should find it in my best interest to visit him before Barbados Independence\
  \ Day.\n\n\nAt one point he leaned back and asked \"What kind of writing do you\
  \ do?\". I leaned in gently for a kiss. I remember looking up at the night sky.\
  \ The stars perfectly lit in between two palm trees. A sight too profound for the\
  \ universe to create. This image permanently carved in my brain.\n\n\nMalcolm was\
  \ right, one man\u2019s paradise is another man\u2019s reality. At that very moment,\
  \ I knew one thing. I was going to miss my flight intentionally."
