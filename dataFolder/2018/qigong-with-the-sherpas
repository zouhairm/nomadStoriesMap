Text: "Qigong with the Sherpas\n\nI went to Nepal in 2015 to trek to Everest Base\
  \ Camp. I\u2019m a very keen adventurer and was looking forward to the trip immensely.\n\
  \nI decided before I went, that whilst there I would do qigong every day amongst\
  \ the spectacular scenery of the Himalayas.  Qigong being a meditative, breathing\
  \ and movement sequence of exercises that gives you life energy and a feeling of\
  \ connection.\n\nI had become interested in qigong whilst on a Canary Island cruise\
  \ in 2014, where I did it every morning on the top deck with a teacher.\n\nI did\
  \ the Everest Base Camp trip with a summit expedition team, as I knew the mountain\
  \ leader Tim who had climbed Everest many times. There were 5 summiteers and 2 trekkers\
  \ to Base Camp, me and Tim\u2019s dad John.\n\nWe arrived at Lukla airport, which\
  \ is the gateway to the Himalayas, and the most dangerous airport  in the world,\
  \ as the runway is very short and the pilot can have only one attempt at landing.\n\
  \nI was very excited and immediately taken aback with the awesome scenery of the\
  \ Himalayas. \n\nWe arrived at a lodge for lunch and the area was full of Sherpas,\
  \ getting ready for the trek ahead to Base Camp. Some were to carry our bags, others\
  \ were to lead. \n\nTim negotiated with our Sherpas a good daily rate of pay. Our\
  \ Sherpas names were Dep Kumar and Prabin and 3 others.  I immediately was aware\
  \ of how friendly and welcoming our sherpas were. Dep could speak quite good English,\
  \ but Prabin not much.\n\nThe first night we stayed in a small village called Tok\
  \ Tok and the lodge was run by a family. The Sherpas would help with the meals and\
  \ serve them to us. They were very helpful and obliging.\n\n I decided to do my\
  \ first qigong session after breakfast the next day, nobody knew that I was going\
  \ to do it. I got out there in front of a huge mountain and performed my qigong\
  \ and I felt totally at one with the Universe and the majestic Himalayas. My comrades\
  \ were smiling when I had finished, I did offer for anyone to join me if they so\
  \ wished, but felt this qigong was maybe too much for these burly mountaineers.\
  \  But the Sherpas looked on in interest.\n\nThe next place we stopped at I decided\
  \ to ask the Sherpas if they wanted to join me in connecting to their spectacular\
  \ mountains. They were more than willing and eager, as many are Buddhists,  and\
  \ I felt connected to them as well through qigong. \n\nIt ended with me doing qigong\
  \ with the Sherpas every morning for three weeks, and what a wonderful experience\
  \ it was.\n\nLoraine Denison"
