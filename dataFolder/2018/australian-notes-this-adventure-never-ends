Text: "Only three hours were left to reach the east coast and swim in the sea. After\
  \ crossing many hundreds of kilomts, we have only been able to find what we usually\
  \ call, nothingness, our senses began to want to smell and perceive the aroma of\
  \ salt and that refreshing and particular breeze that the ocean brings us to earth.\n\
  On way we stopped at a petrol station and how little or big could be the world we\
  \ found 4 of our old friends from Spain, they were hitchhiking to Townsville, so\
  \ we all decided to stay together that night and head up next day.\nThe next day\
  \ the four of us arrived in Townsville, the capital - as it is colloquially called\
  \ - from the north of the state of Queensland. We were anxiously looking for the\
  \ sea after having spent several days driving through the nothingness enduring hot\
  \ weather that asked for water where there was only desert. At the arrival to the\
  \ beach we all ran towards the water with a smile drawn on our faces and we were\
  \ already enveloped by the supreme liquid, celebrating ecstatically.\nWe left the\
  \ boys behind shortly after, we would head north along the coast to visit Cairns,\
  \ a favorite place to sail to visit the battered coral reef. Then I got in touch\
  \ with some old Spanish friends of whom the last clue I had was that they lived\
  \ and worked an hour north of Cairns, in Port Douglas.\n\nTwo other camping companions\
  \ closed the group, with Lucia, Manuel\xB4s girlfriend, and Adri\xE1n, Camilo's\
  \ friend, we were already six people and three vans hissing the map of the northeast\
  \ coast of Australia: the road that offers you arrival in one of the zones of the\
  \ most abundant tropical forest that I saw borders the coast and at the same time\
  \ dodges the hills, as they refer in Brazil to the low mountains of abundant tropical\
  \ forest, making it writhe on itself, curve after curve, it becomes a dangerous\
  \ road at the same time that seductive, inviting you to drive slowly and enchanted\
  \ by its fairytale beauty.\n\nMaria and I continue our trip, hoping to find a Cassowari\
  \ soon, we want to see everything we can and that's why, when a Hungarian nationalized\
  \ Australian gentleman told us about the highest waterfall in the whole state we\
  \ sat in our van and headed towards it , we were already going down a steep path\
  \ through the continental forest that is being devoured by the tropical, in front\
  \ of an impressive waterfall - the wallaman falls - that precipitates the water\
  \ at two hundred and sixty-eight meters of height. Because this does not stop. Life\
  \ does not stop."
