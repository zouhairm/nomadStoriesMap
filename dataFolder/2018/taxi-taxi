Text: "A cold wind greeted me as I arrived at 2 a.m. at the \xB4El Dorado International\
  \ Airport\xB4 in Bogota, Colombia. As I exited the main doors, of the airport, into\
  \ the chilly night, I noticed a women showing people the way to a line, full of\
  \ people. I got closer and finally saw, it was the waiting line for authorized taxis.\
  \ After a few minutes of enduring paralicing cold, I was called to enter a taxi.\
  \ \n\nI opened the taxi door emotionally and sat down on the back seat. The taxi\
  \ drivers head towards me. The first thing I saw in the dark was a friendly smile\
  \ then I starred at the kind eyes of a women. She asked me, in Spanish, what the\
  \ address was.\n\nI was surprised about having a female taxi driver; I had never\
  \ encountered a female taxi driver before. \n\nAfter a moment of silence, I started\
  \ to ask her about her work as a taxi driver and how working in such a male-dominated\
  \ area was for her. She told me about her problems of being a single mum, raising\
  \ an eight-year-old son on her own. The advantage of working independently as a\
  \ taxi driver, since she is able to switch her shift easily without approval of\
  \ nobody. \nShe is one of eleven female taxi drivers working directly at the airport\
  \ and about one of one hundred female taxi drivers in the metropolis of Bogota with\
  \ about 50.000 taxis and a population of eight million. A capital city which is\
  \ moved by buses, private cars, motorbikes, and taxis. She told me about her worries\
  \ with the arrival of new technology in the form of apps, which undercut the precalculated\
  \ fares severely. The hard and long days of single mothers who often life in small\
  \ villages outside of Bogota, because of the lower rent. The hardship which those\
  \ women go through often times waking up at three or four AM in the morning, starting\
  \ by leaving everything prepared and set for their children. In order to travel\
  \ every day for at least two hours to their workplace to enter the shifts on time.\n\
  The violence on the streets and the aggressions against woman. I was her last passenger\
  \ this night she was about to go home to her son.\n\nAfter our 40 minute journey,\
  \ she left me at my address, still, with a big smile on her face and drove away\
  \ into the darkness to her awaiting son."
