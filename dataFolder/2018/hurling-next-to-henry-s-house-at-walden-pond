Text: "As the sun set over the Atlantic on a brisk November night, I turned away from\
  \ Halibut Point and looked one last time at the frozen foam on the beach. I was\
  \ feeling peaceful but cold, and ready for a drink. It was dark when my cousin and\
  \ I made it back to the car. We drove 20 miles south and found a quaint New England\
  \ bar in Manchester-by-the-Sea. We shared some shots of a local raspberry mead,\
  \ and toasted before we downed a few beers. Nothing like a good drink to warm your\
  \ bones! Despite the fact that I had a chest cold, I was feeling good. \n\nWe were\
  \ drunk by the time we drove back to my cousin's house in Dorchester, and the brisk\
  \ air had become frozen. I could feel my noise hairs caked with chunks of boogery\
  \ ice as I breathed in. My cousin's house was full of his roommate's friends by\
  \ the time we arrived, and everyone was drinking and eating Chinese food. Feeling\
  \ like I was at full health again and over the virus, I helped myself to some egg\
  \ rolls. I drank beer after beer with them as we watched Netflix in the warmth and\
  \ safety of the cozy little house in Boston. I went to bed around 1:00AM.\n\nI felt\
  \ terrible when I woke up the next morning. My cold returned, and I was hungover\
  \ to boot. I could't stop coughing and it felt I was going to throw up any minute.\
  \ \"Dude this sucks that I'm sick. I can't believe this, I was so looking forward\
  \ to this.\" After chatting back and forth with my cousin, we decided to grab some\
  \ coffee and head towards Walden Pond despite my health. I wasn't going to let a\
  \ cold stop me from seeing the beauty and history of Massachusetts. \n\nAbout thirty\
  \ minutes passed and we parked in the lot near the cabin at Walden Pond, where Thoreau\
  \ made literary history all of those years ago. My cousin and I approached the cabin,\
  \ and commented on how small it was. We walked around the cabin, which was more\
  \ the size of an outhouse or small shed, peering inside to see the furniture and\
  \ furnace. \n\nSuddenly, I felt really sick to my stomach, and within seconds I\
  \ began to vomit. Here we were in the spot in time where one of the greatest novels\
  \ was written, and I was hurling chunks of chewed Chinese food and beer on the ground\
  \ near Thoreau's cabin. After ten minutes, I finally felt better and my cousin asked\
  \ if I was all right. I wasn't sure what to say to answer his question. I had so\
  \ looked forward to seeing Walden Pond. I had idolized writers like Thoreau growing\
  \ up. \n\nNevertheless, I was feeling better, and ready to see more of majestic\
  \ Massachusetts."
