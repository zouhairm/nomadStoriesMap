Text: "A beautiful city - the weather, near-perfect, even as moody clouds snaked silently\
  \ over the hill-tops and window-rattling thunder rolled through the valley, flashing\
  \ sparks in the distance. I had come to Medellin by chance and now found myself\
  \ wandering a city which seemed achingly familiar, and yet ultimately jarring in\
  \ contrast to my own.\n\n\nTraffic; deafening traffic that never ends. Wild birds\
  \ soar overhead, slicing dizzying circles in the valley\u2019s updraft. \u201CAGUACATE\u201D\
  \ rings out loud across the street as I pass, seconds later a carrito de frutas\
  \ rumbles past. Life goes on. Pans clash and hiss as dinner is served; the distinct\
  \ sound of cheap plastic patio furniture abruptly scraping over tile. Smoke pours\
  \ from ratchet exhaust pipes; tumbling out across the asphalt as a bus pulls in\
  \ to the curb, narrowly missing three pedestrians and a car full of nuns. Horns\
  \ wail as the chaos of rush hour ensues. Ahead, chorizo sizzles contently a streetside\
  \ grill, as a chiva bus rumbles past blasting that reggaeton hit, squealing and\
  \ wrenching as it turns and fades slowly into the distance. \n\n\nAs I ambled along,\
  \ I felt anxiety creep up into my throat and rest quietly in my mouth, behind all\
  \ the Spanish words I didn\u2019t yet know. In Colombia, it seemed, life was lived\
  \ on the street. In Medellin, undoubtedly life was lived in an eruption of primary\
  \ colour, chaos and immutable noise. And I was silenced at first, by my inability\
  \ to communicate or integrate with any of it. So I slipped like a shadow from street\
  \ to street, avoiding eye contact and walking at pace.\n\n\nPast open doorways,\
  \ ladies chattering in makeshift salons and tables gathered around storefronts,\
  \ clinking bottles and bursts of laughter punctuating the air. Eventually, the bustle\
  \ of the day wore thin as distant lights began to twinkle and dance on the hillside.\
  \ The city felt revived, as the passing heat bowed to the humble grace of twilight.\
  \ Still, a low clash of Latin music called out over dusty roof tiles from a neighbouring\
  \ street. Dancing, laughing and exclamations in indecipherable Spanish.\n\n\nAnd\
  \ then for a moment, silence. Followed by the deafening roar of a light aircraft\
  \ as it makes its early evening ascent and the last light of the day peeped innocently\
  \ over the hill-tops."
