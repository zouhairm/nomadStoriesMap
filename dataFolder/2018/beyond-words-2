Text: "At first it seemed just a study task to complete. Our team was in a Hungarian\
  \ city of Szeged and was supposed to prepare an exhibition about local dances and\
  \ their development. The majority of people from my group couldn\u2019t speak Hungarian.\
  \ I wasn\xB4t an exception to that. Communication with locals seemed a challenge,\
  \ but actually not speaking the language was something that didn\u2019t prevent\
  \ us from communication. And that would be something you usually don\u2019t expect.\n\
  We were free to contact people and choose dances to tell about. I fell for tango\
  \ and quite easily found a group who was willing to share their story. The teacher\
  \ was the only person able to communicate in English. He volunteered to be a translator\
  \ for his students. Those weren\u2019t experienced dancers. Quite the opposite.\
  \ They were 10-year-old children who  managed to express an essence of tango with\
  \ a unique devotion. \nI was allowed to observe only one class before a Christmas\
  \ concert at their dance school. Having arrived a bit in advance I witnessed children\
  \ get prepared for the class. They were speaking in Hungarian. I couldn\u2019t understand\
  \ a word. Were they talking about a day at school or how afraid they were to forget\
  \ a dance routine? I couldn\u2019t tell. But still there was something easy to relate\
  \ to, not verbally. \nThe teacher entered the dance room. The class started and\
  \ kids became really focused and serious. Not for the fear, but more for their interest\
  \ to what they were doing. The difference in moves was easy to observe. Some students\
  \ had more experience, others still needed a bit more training. But with no exception\
  \ each of them was clearly doing best.\nWith the help of a tango teacher I got to\
  \ talk to children. I couldn\u2019t help but wonder what filled them with this authentic\
  \ understanding of emotions they eventually haven\u2019t experienced yet. They compared\
  \ tango with nature, for example a thunder or seasons.\n \u2018For me it is like\
  \ spring and a wind rushing through the leaves on the trees\u2019, says one of the\
  \ girls, while her friend tells something else, \u2018I feel very still in the middle\
  \ of the storm\u2019\nI left the dance class with a thought. These dancers and I\
  \ had something in common. They had little understanding about passion in movement\
  \ and I had a poor knowledge of Hungarian. Yet there are things way beyond words.\
  \ It is about a universal language \u2013 like dance in this case. We always hope\
  \ to find understanding beyond borders and barriers. But it is rather rare. And\
  \ happens  when we least expect it."
