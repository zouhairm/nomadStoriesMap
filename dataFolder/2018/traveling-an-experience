Text: "These days everyone wants to travel and travelers now have access to various\
  \ to do lists, places to visit, customized itineraries.There is certain elitism\
  \ associated with people who can afford to travel regularly.For most,it is more\
  \ about posting a status \u201C#wanderlust\u201D on social media and not actually\
  \ wandering off exploring places.\n\nWhen I started traveling,things were not the\
  \ same. We relied upon other people.We would speak to others for everything from\
  \ understanding the routes to sites to visit. Or we would, simply, find out on our\
  \ own by wandering around.We did not rush to see the place that we might have thought\
  \ of as a \"must-see-place\"! And the last thing I expected is that those itinerary-less\
  \ travel experiences, where I didn't have a checklist with me, would be my most\
  \ cherished travel memories!The best of memories I have, come from the unplanned\
  \ incidents, at places where we just happened to be,with people we didn\u2019t intend\
  \ to meet in the first place.\n\nNow things have changed! I see people who have\
  \ long checklists of tourist attractions they have to cover. I wouldn't deny that\
  \ I too am guilty of doing the same in my first trip abroad, which was to Thailand.\
  \ I planned to visit Bangkok, Phuket and Krabi, all in 5 days.I hurriedly hopped\
  \ from the \"Grand Palace\" to \"Wat Arun\", From \"Jim Thompson's Silk Museum\"\
  \ to \"Hotel Baiyoke\" to chilling at \"Khao San Road\" - all in my 2 days in Bangkok!\
  \  \n\nAfter that trip to Thailand, I was exhausted instead of feeling rejuvenated!\
  \ I had to take a day off from work after coming back home just to recover from\
  \ the back breaking trip. I was surprised that after spending all my savings on\
  \ my first trip abroad, I didn't have a single story to tell.\n\nI changed the way\
  \ I travel after that. One of my most fond memories come from the time I booked\
  \ a terrible place of stay in Prague and just to avoid being in there, we went out\
  \ in freezing December cold. We kept strolling through all the big and small streets\
  \ of old town, followed the tracks of tram, went to the public library and then\
  \ we reached the Old Town Square. With hot mulled wine in our hands, we spoke to\
  \ many fellow tourists, the stall owners,listening to their stories about the place\
  \ and their travels, we were out till 4 AM! And we didn't even realize. This was\
  \ the most delightful experience I had. These experiences, these little surprises\
  \ are the ones that make me immensely happy and help me grow and they are the sole\
  \ reason I love traveling!"
