Text: "\u2018If I don\u2019t have legs that look like they were carved by Michelangelo\
  \ by the end of this, there is no justice in this world\u2019. I huffed as blood\
  \ crept down my leg and gave the offending stone a kick. At least one of us had\
  \ taken a souvenir from my, 1,578-metre 'walk', and by walk I mean the arduous 4-hour\
  \ hike/crawl to the summit of Roys Peak and its indomitable view of Lake Wanaka,\
  \ albeit a few layers of skin from my left knee.\n\nI watched as the stone ambled\
  \ its way down the dusted pathway and shook my head at the incredulity of it all.\
  \ Where would I have expected to be on New Year's day 2018? \n\nNo more than two\
  \ years ago, a New Year's day would be spent, same as always, with the cold husk\
  \ of winter nipping at my fingers as I wade my way through the stumbling hooves\
  \ and musky scent of a small town square in Devon. Balancing on one hand, my precious\
  \ cargo of port and steaming mince pies. Trading them one by one for a familiar\
  \ smile and kind wishes for the year ahead.\n\nIf you had told me then, on one of\
  \ those frosty mornings, that one day I would be standing alone, on the brink of\
  \ what felt like the edge of the earth on the furthest side of the world from home.\
  \ I would\u2019ve cut you off from the port. \n\nYet here I was and it was phenomenal.\
  \ \n\n9 hours earlier I had been one of the last festival-goers standing amongst\
  \ the Southern Alps whilst the vacant speakers hummed their swan song. Thus, with\
  \ a monotone symphony in our ears, us delirious strangers smiled at one another\
  \ as if to say, this, this is our year before wordlessly dispersing through the\
  \ transient shanty town of nylon.\n\nWaking to the oppressive heat that only a tent\
  \ can muster, I peeled back the zip and sprawled out somewhere close to awake yet\
  \ not. Closing my eyes I greedily breathed in the day as the grass brushed the tips\
  \ of my ears and the sun gently warmed my face, blissfully unaware of how much my\
  \ body would despise me in the hours to come. \n\nSweat gathered in every nook and\
  \ cranny my body had to offer and after a disappointing reply to a gasping text\
  \ of \u2018Please tell me this levels out at some point?\u2019 only an hour in,\
  \ I began to question my sanity. Only the earnest reassurance of my sympathetic\
  \ successors and sheer stubbornness carried my aching limbs to the summit that day.\n\
  \nIt was there standing alone, on the brink of what felt like the edge of the earth,\
  \ above the clouds on the furthest side of the world from home on January 1st 2018\u2026\
  \ I could\u2019ve done with a glass of port."
