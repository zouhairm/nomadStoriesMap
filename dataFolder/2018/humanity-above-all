Text: "Abba ached to be a pilgrim. Hajj was beyond the strands of my withered skull\
  \ cap. I manage to visit Varanasi. Abba wasn\u2019t a zealot, he will be happy.\
  \ \nOn a usual sandalwood scented evening which resonates with any Hindu, I walk\
  \ through the overcrowded markets to reach Dashashwamedh Ghat. Amidst the shambolic\
  \ market roads, a rainbow of women in colorful saris flickered throughout while\
  \ Jesus smiled, resting beside the posters of Lord Shiva. \nGanga Aarti would begin\
  \ anytime soon. Positioning myself on the ghat steps, I would witness the aarti\
  \ from the eyes of my departed father. An obeying son, always. \nHindu mythology\
  \ was reflecting under the light of golden flames. You could find it lying as a\
  \ conch shell or prayer bells on the wooden platform. Varanasi is a land of unity.\
  \ Culturally divided India wiped their boundaries and blended at the ghat. Faith\
  \ on their faces was unalloyed. \nI folded my skull cap and housed it inside my\
  \ pocket. \nIdentically dressed priests of young age arrived to perform Ganga Aarti.\
  \ Seemingly staunch devotees of Hinduism began chanting the hymns with them. A little\
  \ girl frowned on seeing my sealed lips. I, to look one among them, managed to lip-sync.\
  \ \nBlowing of a conch shell before the aarti seemed similar to the sound of azaan\
  \ before namaz. It prompts each man to pray to his Creator. Different religions,\
  \ single path. \nThe priests began to wave big multi-tiered lamps synchronically;\
  \ its motion enthralled me completely. Camphor filled lamps threw flames like tsunami.\
  \ A hubbub of chants in rhythm with the sound of the prayer bells discontinued the\
  \ reality around me. I was entering into a state of trance. I was no longer my father.\
  \ I was me. \nA sudden desire to be a part of this ceremony escalated my heartbeats.\
  \ I wanted to move the huge burning lamps clockwise or at least hold it, uncaring\
  \ of the identity I carry. Muslim? Hindu? It didn\u2019t matter to me. \nReality\
  \ hit me when one of the priests approached me with a big lamp for blessings. I\
  \ knew it was impossible. I gazed at the little fires while I took blessings and\
  \ convinced myself to be content with the experience of viewing the ceremony. \n\
  \u201CDo you wish to do what I am doing?\u201D asked the priest, smiling. \nI did\
  \ not anticipate this to happen. Before I could say anything, I was handed the lamp\
  \ and asked to make people seek blessings from the holy flame. As I turned, he held\
  \ me by my arm, removed the skull cap out of my shirt pocket and dressed it over\
  \ my head. I smiled. My Hajj is done."
