Text: "I love adrenaline. Sometimes knowing the truth gives adrenaline too.\nWhen\
  \ there is a military conflict somewhere, the people are going through the harshest\
  \ times ever. Whereas others, who live in safer places, want to get close to understand\
  \ what it is like. \nSadly, I\u2019m not sure whether it is compassion that pushed\
  \ me towards that trip or the knowing that I\u2019m after all only a \u201Cpasser-by\u201D\
  \ and can always return to a safer place.\nWhatever the case, in July 2014 I decided\
  \ to make a trip to Crimea. It had just suffered a separation from Ukraine and was\
  \ joined back to Russia. There was no army intervention as such, but the situation\
  \ was shaky. \nI remember going there when I was little with my family and was dying\
  \ to see how much, if at all, things had changed. Getting on a ferry from Russian\
  \ coast to Crimea nothing seemed to be different. In fact, I\u2019d almost forgotten\
  \ about the purpose of my journey. I remember there was a pod of dolphins swimming\
  \ alongside the ship. I was overwhelmed!\nThe trip, however, was magical for about\
  \ 20 minutes. When you get on shore, you are thrown into a completely different\
  \ reality. Visually it seems familiar. The bus trip into the city still goes through\
  \ the fields. The landscape is mainly yellow grass, bathed in and then swiftly burned\
  \ by the sun. Crimeans say that there\u2019s not one hill in their land that hasn\u2019\
  t been flooded with blood in WW2. You can still see neat white houses surrounded\
  \ by apple and pear trees. And all along the way there\u2019s that sweet smell \u2013\
  \ of fruit and salty sea water. \nBut you sense there\u2019s something wrong. As\
  \ if there is that picture in front of you, which is almost believable, but behind,\
  \ something had cracked. \nWhen I got to my destination, I realized my hotel was\
  \ far from the centre. A mistake that turned out to be fortunate, in a way.\nI left\
  \ my luggage and immediately left the room hoping I\u2019d find an adventure to\
  \ write about. To my surprise down town the feeling was exactly the same as in any\
  \ other sea resort. There were tourists everywhere, bars were full and happy children\
  \ were running around, unaware of what military means altogether. I had to retreat\
  \ back to my hotel. I saw I couldn\u2019t find any answers in those streets.\nI\
  \ ended up having a restless night and at 5 am was up to have my first morning coffee.\
  \ Turned out my hotel was on the street that connected the ferry port with the entrance\
  \ to the whole peninsula. The last thing I expected to see that morning were dozens\
  \ of tanks driving into the city."
