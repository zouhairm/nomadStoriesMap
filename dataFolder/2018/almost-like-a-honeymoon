Text: "It was late August but the summer had come and gone with a vengeance, almost\
  \ as if winter were excited to claim the territory for itself.\n Norway was our\
  \ farewell trip. If our marriage was going to end, we might as well celebrate together\
  \ one last time. Almost like a honeymoon, but in reverse.\n He wanted to go up to\
  \ the Hardangervidda plateau. We managed Bergen and Oslo during our two-week trip,\
  \ but it was our hikes through the palsa bogs of Hardangervidda and the slopes of\
  \ Domb\xE5s and Dovrefjell that left the strangest memories in my mind.\n The plateau\
  \ was high and Norway so large. We stayed in Eidfjord a few days. By the time we\
  \ reached Dyranut from there, rain and wind had swept in over the region. He was\
  \ in his new trekking pants that kept him warm as we hiked over icy bog. I shivered\
  \ in my two layers of cotton leggings \u2013 not enough to ward off the cold of\
  \ Norway\u2019s highlands.\n The permafrost took me by surprise. I had never experienced\
  \ walking through frozen marshlands before. It behaved like a sponge, squelching\
  \ under my feet.\n Then there were the lemmings. All furry ginger, white, and black,\
  \ like wild hamsters. They let out squeals of terror as they crossed paths with\
  \ us, leaping for the next rock and shelter from us giants.\n We got down on all\
  \ fours at one point, curiosity getting the best of us. He reached out a gloved\
  \ hand, wiggling his fingers beneath a rock under which a lemming had ducked. He\
  \ stroked the creature\u2019s soft underside. I tried the same, but the animal had\
  \ shifted under the rock. I poked at its belly by accident and it squeaked in fright.\n\
  \ Furuhaughli Huts was WiFi-free. We spent each day outdoors, instead. I encountered\
  \ mushrooms as large as a man\u2019s head during our hikes. I was surprised at how\
  \ massive things could grow when man left them alone.\n We went on a Musk Ox safari\
  \ and learned that the animal was an overgrown sheep, a creature from the ice age.\
  \ Our guide stopped every now and then, showing us the dark wool that the Musk Ox\
  \ had left behind on foliage during the height of summer. It had rubbed off its\
  \ winter layers on branches and leaves. \n I took a tiny tangle of it home with\
  \ me. I held it up to the light when we were on the plane ride back home, and he\
  \ held it with me. \n \u201CWhy don\u2019t we go on another trip together after\
  \ this?\u201D he said, and I leaned against his chest, inhaling in the scent of\
  \ him."
