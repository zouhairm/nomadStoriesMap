Text: "The Holy Land is no doubt an eternal one, which is why everyone wants a piece\
  \ of it. Jerusalem is a multicultural and multi-faith community in a box where the\
  \ Jewish quarter has a different feels; totally different from the Muslim, the Christian\
  \ and the Armenian quarters. It is 4 destinations in 1. Each quarter almost share\
  \ the same history and culture, but the differences of their historical versions\
  \ and perspectives towards \u201Choliness & the Holy Land\u201D makes Jerusalem\
  \ more exciting.\n\nOutside the old walled city, is the new Jerusalem with new buildings,\
  \ also has different \u201Cquarters\u201D \u2013 the East Jerusalem, claimed by\
  \ the Palestinian Territories and the West Jerusalem, claimed by Israel. Inside\
  \ the West Jerusalem are another two separated \u201Cquarters,\u201D one for the\
  \ Ultra-Orthodox Jews and another for the Secular Jews. There is tension, of course.\
  \ But the opportunity for me as an outsider to witness streets, walls, buildings,\
  \ people that are totally opposite and different from the scenery and people across\
  \ the street, is incredibly amazing! The East has the old Arab-town feels and literally\
  \ 10 steps ahead without a border is like a European town. But my favorite of all\
  \ is the place called Mea Sharim, a place exclusively for the Ultra-orthodox Jews,\
  \ which has the look of a 1800s era. Unfortunately, photos, charts, colorful clothes\
  \ and loud voices are prohibited.\n\nJerusalem is home to internationals who are\
  \ working with human rights and humanitarian organizations, churches, and is home\
  \ to embassies and consulates. Thus, Jerusalem is a party place \u2013 but not as\
  \ loud compared to Tel Aviv. In the East side are excellent Jerusalem restaurants\
  \ serving with sisha, authentic baba ghanoush and festive Arab music. On the West\
  \ side are small bars with flowing beers and a place to dance wild until dawn. However,\
  \ on Fridays, Jerusalem is dead, with the Jewish strictly observes Shabbat prayers\
  \ and the Muslims strictly observes the Jummah prayers.\n\nMeanwhile, the east side\
  \ of Jerusalem has the best cappuccino."
