Text: "My daughter and I decided to book a trip to Italy, we needed a much-deserved\
  \ vacation. Italy had been sitting on my bucket list for quite some time.  We booked\
  \ our flights to arrive in Rome and return from Venice. The next morning, we made\
  \ our way to the airport and before we knew it we arrived in Rome. We stayed at\
  \ the hotel, Regina Giovanna. The staff was excellent, the room was clean situated\
  \ in a great location. While in Rome, we explored the city; visited shops and tourist\
  \ attractions. We purchased tickets from Rome Hop-On Hop-Off sightseeing tour, it\
  \ offered us the convenience to travel at our convenience. The Colosseum was one\
  \ of my favorites,  we opted for a guided tour since the price was affordable and\
  \ it allowed us to avoid the long lines.  The structure and details of the art and\
  \ sculpture were amazing. We made our way to ancient Rome and went on to visit other\
  \ points of interests such as a castle and museums. Our next destination was Florence.\
  \ We stayed at the Golf Hotel, it was a clean hotel and walking distance from the\
  \ local shops, restaurants. We found Florence to be a lot like Rome and enjoyed\
  \ sightseeing. We then made our way for a day trip to Cinque Terre with the Runabout\
  \ Tour. This experience was nothing less than amazing, the guides knew their history\
  \ and were very entertaining. Hiking and nature were definitely on the menu. Our\
  \ last stop; Venice, I never saw anything like it; tons of shops and restaurants.\
  \ One of our favorite restaurants was Bella & Brava, they made delicious vegan pizza.\
  \ Another treat was the vegan gelato that could be found at a local caf\xE9. We\
  \ also planned to experience a gondola tour. The last thing I expected was to actually\
  \ have the chance to try and navigate one. While walking and exploring we stumbled\
  \ upon some of the guides offering the gondola rides. We immediately proceeded to\
  \ embark on the gondola. The guide was a small framed man, he was wearing a striped\
  \ shirt and glasses, he had a mustache and a pleasant smile. He was charming and\
  \ very easy to talk too. Among many conversations, he explained that the boats were\
  \ hard to navigate without proper training. The last thing I expected was to be\
  \ offered to try which I did without hesitation.  I loved Italy and everything it\
  \ has to offer."
