Text: "After spending 3 days in this magical city of Phuket which was full of music,\
  \ thrill & most importantly love, I decided to have a new & exciting day tomorrow,\
  \ It had just been few days since I started to explore every street of this city\
  \ which had already envelope me in its warmth of love & togetherness. After running\
  \ errands, I hop back to my hotel & hit the bed early that day.\n  On waking up\
  \ to the beautiful view of Patong beach, I dress up quickly to catch my cruise to\
  \ the most bewitching place, \"Phi Phi island.\" On touching the island I had my\
  \ heads up for scuba to explore the mystical underwater world. Excited but apprehensive\
  \ and then nervous, I wear my swimcoat, knowing I had never really dived into water\
  \ being a hydrophobic, So with all my guts I forcebly put my foot forward trying\
  \ to match my guide's pace. To my surprise I felt good as I swam deeper & deeper\
  \ with my increasing anxiety & palpitation fading away into the pearl blue ocean,\
  \ the coral fishes brushed themselves against me, the joy of witnessing Nemo to\
  \ bunch of clown trigger fish to harlequin shrimp to the wonderful pack of honeycomb\
  \ Eels, I was blessed to experience this spectacular moment in my life so much so\
  \ that it made me forget all my grief and agony of failed marriage through which\
  \ I escaped and came here. Suddenly I noticed something unfamiliar at the base of\
  \ that zone, on probing further both of us decided to examine what that blingy huge\
  \ thing was, To my astonishment it was a scrapped silver coated boat with many bruises\
  \ assuming how it must have failed, as I feel the boat's skin on my right palm,\
  \ few scribbles grabbed my attention, I partially sqeezed my eye to read the words\
  \ clearly, it said \n\"I survived 7 days of Tsunami,\n Love Mel\" \n Quickly I recalled\
  \ 26th December 2004, when a terrible Tsunami hit Phi Phi Don washing away multiple\
  \ villages & their people along with it. I fe\u200Elt goosebumps on my skin. It\
  \ was the last thing I ever expected from this rejuvinating journey that I would\
  \ experience a debilitating life's period of someone who she must have gone through\
  \ irreversible despair to finally surrendering herself to no hopes of survival and\
  \ letting the death of god embrace her in her arms. I moved towards the surface\
  \ praying for her wonderful life wherever she is. I came back to my hotel after\
  \ a quiet supper, that helped me contemplate what potential a journey has. With\
  \ a smile I pack my bag to let the new city unfold its mysterious story to me.\n\
  Bangkok, Here I come."
