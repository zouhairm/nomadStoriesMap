Text: "Oily Bombay street food caked my intestines and my throat was scratchy from\
  \ the smog. My role as a white extra in Bollywood had filled my pockets and the\
  \ romance of Rajasthan was calling. \n\nI stumbled out of my friend\u2019s apartment,\
  \ booze on my breathe and vague optimism behind my eyes. I stomped to the highway\
  \ and spent the next few hours fumbling in and out of vehicles, travelling in the\
  \ vague direction of North. \n\nI met an esteemed sound healer, an engineer and\
  \ a doctor before I reached the exit to a filthy industrial town. A pick-up truck\
  \ stopped and I hesitated; my instinct was right and he later attempted to drive\
  \ off with my backpack. Flustered, I ate a crushed banana and was met by the first\
  \ female driver to pick me up in India!  Five contrasting rides later I stood at\
  \ a junction 400 km north of Mumbai. \n\nThings feel a little different hitchhiking\
  \ as the sun is coming down. The road to Rajasthan looked desolate, but a car stopped\
  \ soon enough. I climbed in cautiously, immediately unsure of his motive. We spoke\
  \ a little - the basics, my country, my religion...His eyes looked dishonest and\
  \ I felt uncomfortable. We endured a long silence. \"Do you like fun?\" He asked.\
  \ \"Fun? Yes.\" I replied, cautiously. Silence. \"Do you like fun with me?\" I stared,\
  \ disgusted. \"5000 rupees.\" He offered. \"5000 rupees for 15 minutes of fun.\"\
  \n\nI shouted and demanded he stopped the car. I was lucky, he did. I felt nauseous.\
  \ \n\nMen glared, no women were in sight. Each car crawled by, staring, sensing\
  \ my fear. I refused the next five rides, petrified of potential predators.\n\n\
  A car stopped ahead, the driver was dressed in a suit and with gentle eyes he invited\
  \ me in. \u201CThese men are hungry. Come with my wife and children. Stay with us\
  \ tonight.\"\n\nWe were welcomed in his hometown by his family and an army of excited\
  \ neighbors. I FaceTimed four of the ladies husbands and drank chai in six homes\
  \ consecutively. No one understood why I was alone. It's unheard of for a woman\
  \ to travel unaccompanied in their community. I assured them I had friends in Udaipur\
  \ and they became desperate to reunite me. \n\nThey drove me to the bus station\
  \ at 10 pm, and rapidly ferried me onto an overflowing bus, engaging everyone in\
  \ a game of pass the parcel. The family frantically waved at me, incessantly blowing\
  \ kisses. The old lady next to me saw my eyes welling up. \"Family good.\" She points,\
  \ smiling. I nod. \"You look so many tires.\" I grinned, laid my head on her shoulder\
  \ and slept the bus ride away."
