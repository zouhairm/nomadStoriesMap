Text: "Tokyo can be an exhausting place. The masses of humanity hustling from place\
  \ to place, the neon flashing lights, and the mere size of the city all were quite\
  \ overwhelming. This was my first trip to Tokyo and I had tried to cram as much\
  \ into my days as possible. From the mesmerizing and hectic auction at Tsukiji Fish\
  \ Market to the vibrant colors of Harajuku, I felt like I had \u201Cexperienced\
  \ Tokyo\u201D. At least the Tokyo from my guidebook and TV travel programs.\n \n\
  For my last night, I wanted to do something special, but was exhausted from my chaotic\
  \ week and took an unexpected nap. I woke up around 8 PM and didn\u2019t have an\
  \ appetite, but had already spent enough time in my shoebox-sized nondescript hotel\
  \ room. Far away from the glitz of Ginza, I started aimlessly wandering. Meandering\
  \ westwards from nearby Ikebukuru Station, the neighborhood slowly becomes residential.\
  \ The loud cacophony of the big city subtly transforms into the quieter hum of locals\
  \ living. I let myself truly relax for the first time all week and roamed some more.\n\
  \nThe yellow flash of the local street-level train passed a few feet to my right,\
  \ temporarily jarring me from my tranquility. As the piercing beam of the taillights\
  \ trailed off into the distance, I looked several blocks down the tracks to the\
  \ left. A businessman in a dark suit held a fresh bouquet of flowers aloft as he\
  \ scurried home to his wife. I wondered whether he would be celebrating or apologizing\
  \ when he opened his door a few minutes later. \nAnd to the right, some 10-year-old\
  \ children bounced a ball rhythmically, giggling loudly at whatever 10-year-olds\
  \ giggle at, before scampering up ahead. A few seconds behind, two elderly women\
  \ in long floral dresses had a calm discussion, their slow pace causing the soothing\
  \ chatter to linger into the darkening night. The smell of grilled meat from a nearby\
  \ izakaya wafted over, enticing my now hungry stomach.\n\nBut I wasn\u2019t ready\
  \ to go yet. I just couldn\u2019t make myself leave, curious as to what else I\u2019\
  d see. Knowing that this was really why I hoard my precious vacation days and tolerate\
  \ interminable flights. I stood there for maybe an hour, just absorbing, watching\
  \ Japanese life play out in front of me. No one bothered me. No one even seemed\
  \ to notice me. \n\nThe last thing I expected was to find my favorite spot next\
  \ to the train tracks, away from everything I thought I knew about Tokyo. Yet, it\
  \ remains a lasting memory that I cherish and hope to return to someday."
