Text: "Life truly has a way of making you see things the way they should be. After\
  \ having lived most of my life on the road, because my dad was a workaholic and\
  \ we had to follow his dreams; I finally decided to settle down in a small but wonderful\
  \ city called Porto. At first I followed my degree, biology so I was a full time\
  \ slave for a while, then I decided I needed more freedom and I became a part-time\
  \ slave. The taste of this freedom was too good to say no to, like the pleasure\
  \ of eating crispy bacon in the morning, so finally with the help of Bukowski I\
  \ was pushed to find more. I quit and went on slight binge for the first couple\
  \ months living on benefits. This gave me allot of time to think, as well as drink,\
  \ and out of all the projects that I was involved with to keep my mind busy and\
  \ the funds in my pocket not looking too depleted, it was writing about the city\
  \ that kept me going.\n \nWhat first interested me about writing and unravelling\
  \ stories was the fact that I had lived most of my life away from my birthplace\
  \ and finally now 25 years later I was living there and rediscovering the city.\
  \ People and places started to look different and life gained a new meaning, the\
  \ same way I had tasted that bacon I was now enjoying similar flavours with writing.\
  \ I realized that the most important thing in life is to discover the most comfortable\
  \ way to express yourself, I finally understood what my musician and painter friends\
  \ were so excited about. Like meeting the woman of your dreams by accident I became\
  \ hooked instantly and I started to document all my favourite places in city, every\
  \ story made me feel like a junkie after his fix. \n\nI have finally found one of\
  \ the things I love to do, I hope there are more, but I believe it is this one that\
  \ will open my eyes to others. I know this isn\u2019t exactly the \u201Cuncovering\
  \ of a great travel story\u201D that you were looking for but it was spending my\
  \ childhood travelling and settling down in Porto which opened my eyes to what I\
  \ think will be one of my greatest passions. To you this might seem banal, but to\
  \ me it really did change my perspective in life.\n\nI\u2019m only getting started,\
  \ I have my first book deal, hardly any money left but I\u2019m happy and I don\u2019\
  t really have any plans for the future, except to travel, write and see where this\
  \ passion takes me next."
