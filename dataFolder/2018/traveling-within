Text: "This story you have embarked upon is not painted in vibrant tints of tropical\
  \ Hawaiian waters, nor is it filled with endless laughter of lifelong friendships.\
  \ For I am young, and lack a lifetime of external exploration. It may be that I\
  \ am young, but my youth sure enough has glimpsed into the eyes of poverty, walked\
  \ hand in hand with sorrow, and kissed the blood stained lips of truth. This is\
  \ not a story of a brief time lived abroad; it is the story of a little girl, one\
  \ who had big dreams, who chased critters of all shapes and sizes, one who dreamt\
  \ of having wings. Or perhaps she was a butterfly, who dreamt of being a little\
  \ girl. Nonetheless, this child is me, and I grew up, instead of growing wings.\
  \ \n\n My entire life, I have felt outside the compass. I knew right off the bat\
  \ I was not cut out for the stereotypical American dream, that longs for the perfect\
  \ spouse, two lovely children, and a white picket fence framing their \u201Cperfect\u201D\
  \ lives. What I desired was not a picture perfect existence, but rather a handful\
  \ of genuine human experiences; to doze off beneath salt scattered skies, or perchance\
  \ under the flicker of Northern Lights; to awake and smell crisp air between yawning\
  \ Redwoods, and dig my toes into cool white sandy beaches, only to strip down and\
  \ run wild into salty waves. \n\n Through my life travels within, it has become\
  \ apparent that I do not want to live confined within paper walls. One strike of\
  \ a match, and the walls will crumble and burn the illusions they had bestowed upon\
  \ their occupants. When I see my happiest self, she is empty handed upon the soft\
  \ floors of the earth, fallen to her knees, having placed her being upon a broad\
  \ spectrum of vulnerability; nothing left, besides the tattered threads woven tightly\
  \ together, upon her frail back. I want to drive past the speed limit, be stopped\
  \ by the law, questioned, and held accountable for my actions, because I want to\
  \ grow, to evolve into the divine creation I have always been, beneath the barely\
  \ scratched surface of my soul. I want to free the collar of my shirt from the needle\
  \ point arrow of the ticking clock, climb up the numbers til I reach twelve, and\
  \ take a leap of faith; watching the yarn, time has so effortlessly wrapped around\
  \ my limbs, unravel before my sight. The last thing I expected, was to take the\
  \ risk, to travel far beneath the very depths of myself and discover a new meaning\
  \ to life itself. That little girl, without a doubt, has earned her wings."
