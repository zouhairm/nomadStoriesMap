Text: "The heat of the thick, stagnant air hit me in the face as I stepped into the\
  \ old bus in front of me. Day two of my solo backpacking adventure and I\u2019d\
  \ already sweated through half my clothes, gotten lost twice, and lost in translation\
  \ more times than I could count. We left the city and drove through the countryside\
  \ and I settled in for the long ride, feeling quietly proud that I\u2019d even made\
  \ it onto the right bus.\n\nI enjoyed the scenery but began to feel increasingly\
  \ on edge as the driver made a series of announcements that I couldn\u2019t understand.\
  \ Everyone around me chatted in Serbian and I had no idea what was going on. After\
  \ several hours two kind ladies sitting in front of me realised I couldn\u2019t\
  \ understand. In broken English and a lot of sign language they translated the drivers\
  \ words, and even led me off at the next stop to help me find a bathroom.\n\nHours\
  \ passed, and long after we were due to arrive in Sarajevo, I watched in horror\
  \ as we drove straight through the city without stopping. With all my fears and\
  \ anxieties back in full force, I clambered to the front of the bus and asked the\
  \ driver if he would stop. He gave me a confused look, clearly not understanding\
  \ and sent me back to my seat.\n\nAll my worst fears were confirmed: I was lost,\
  \ no one spoke English and I would die in the middle of the Bosnian countryside.\
  \ Unsure what else to do, I sat back down and began to contemplate my fate. Fifteen\
  \ minutes later the bus pulled off to the side of the road and the driver let out\
  \ a resounding call for Sarajevo. Equal parts relieved and concerned I jumped out,\
  \ backpack in tow.\n\nThe bus drove off but I was in the middle of nowhere! As I\
  \ tried to stay calm, I noticed a man behind me who had been asleep at the back\
  \ of the bus. He barely had to take one took at me before asking - in perfect English\
  \ - if I was okay. I nearly cried with joy when he offered to drive me the 20km\
  \ back into the city and to my hostel.\n\nWhile he drove we chatted about university,\
  \ travel and our hobbies, and even discovered we\u2019d been reading the same book!\
  \ Despite our different lives we had so much in common. He offered to show me around\
  \ his city and over the next few days my new friend, Ismar, took me through Sarajevo.\
  \ From tiny cafes to rooftop bars and hidden street art, I was always welcomed in\
  \ by his friends and family. My first few days were a perfect indication of the\
  \ next seven months of life on the road, and as my fears turned to trust I had some\
  \ of the best adventures of my life."
