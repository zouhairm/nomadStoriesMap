Text: "The year was 1996. I was about to turn 21 and finally it came my first chance\
  \ of going abroad. The trip was carefully planned: a 1-month English course in London,\
  \ staying at a house of a local family. I was a shy girl back then, somewhat insecure.\
  \ Nevertheless, my will to start knowing the world pushed me forward. \nLondon stay\
  \ was just as planned: studying, walking around the city, visiting all famous sites,\
  \ museums, Broadway musicals and, of course, pubs. Although sometimes alone, it\
  \ felt very safe. I spoke English and I had my \u201CEnglish\u201D family and school\
  \ colleagues around. \nAs I had already crossed the Atlantic, why not to go a bit\
  \ farther? Without further planning, there I was on my way to Paris with a short\
  \ list of goals: Louvre Museum, Eiffel Tower and Arc de Triomphe. \nAn unpleasant\
  \ surprise welcomed me in Paris: a messed up hostel room, impossible to stay in.\
  \ At that moment, the courage that took me there just vanished. Alone in a strange\
  \ city, with strange people and speaking no more than 5 or 6 sentences in French\
  \ that were completely useless. \u201CJai t\u2019aime\u201D had indeed no use there.\
  \ Mixing English and mimic, I managed to ask for another room and learned that I\
  \ had to wait few hours to confirm if there was another available bed. \nFeeling\
  \ upset and with a bit of regret of my decision to travel alone to Paris, I took\
  \ a deep breath and decided that the best thing to do was to start exploring Paris.\
  \ Champs-\xC9lys\xE9es seemed the right place to go. \nIndeed it was! After buying\
  \ a travel guide in English \u2013 there were no smartphones and apps back in 1996\
  \ -, I have met my first goal: Arc de Triomphe. Imposing and full of history. The\
  \ view of this monument convinced me that I had done the right thing. \nWhen I went\
  \ back to the hostel, I have got another a room shared with two Brazilian girls\
  \ like me. One of them took me to Versailles, a great addition to my short list\
  \ of goals. I visited Louvre Museum, and its historical building and all the artworks\
  \ enchanted me, although the size of Monalisa disappointed me a bit. I went to Eiffel\
  \ Tower too, but its top was closed for visit, a good reason to come back someday,\
  \ which I have done twice so far.   \nWith that decision that pushed me to the edge\
  \ of my world I learned that there was a whole world that I could explore by myself.\
  \ Certainly, it was a stepping-stone in my passion for travelling that, over the\
  \ following 22 years, took me to so many places and will still take me to many more."
