Text: "My coworkers were itching for our fourth quarter meeting to end and vacation\
  \ to start. I was out of PTO, so I sat there knowing I would have to work the following\
  \ week, or so I thought. Our CEO announced that for the first time ever, our office\
  \ would be closed the week between Christmas and New Years! My mind began to race,\
  \ but it appeared for different reasons than those around me.\n\nEveryone began\
  \ talking about the shopping they\u2019ll finish and the movies they\u2019ll binge\
  \ watch.  Contrarily, I began to wonder, \u2018where could I go?\u2019. This was\
  \ the perfect opportunity to travel, and without the burden of checking work emails.\
  \ Also, it meant escaping the sub-zero temperatures and much anticipated, yet, predictably\
  \ uneventful night that New Years Eve tends to be in Minnesota.\n\nI\u2019ve always\
  \ wanted to learn how to surf, so after researching locations, I booked a surf retreat\
  \ on the west coast of Costa Rica. I extended a few invites, but it was too short\
  \ notice. I\u2019ve never traveled alone internationally, but it appeared I would\
  \ be making this trip solo.\n\nThe travel day came before I knew it. My parents\
  \ brought me to the airport and tried to hide their anxiety from me going out of\
  \ the country alone. I assured them I would be safe as I hugged them goodbye.\n\n\
  An exhausting day of travel mixed with dramamine made sleep come easy. I awoke refreshed\
  \ and excited the next morning, but also nervous. I wondered if anyone would talk\
  \ to me at breakfast? That fear quickly faded and I realized as a solo traveler,\
  \ especially as a female, people are exceptionally friendly. I bonded with other\
  \ guests and staff right away.\n\nEach day was my own. If I felt like surfing or\
  \ reading, I did just that. If I wanted to socialize, I could seek someone out.\
  \ It was at that moment that I realized, I could do whatever I wanted and whenever\
  \ I felt like doing it! I didn\u2019t have to run my plans by anyone and if I changed\
  \ my mind, it had little impact.\n\nA week prior, the last thing I would have expected\
  \ was to be spending New Years Eve on the beach with my surf instructor and new\
  \ Swedish friends. Although, I wouldn't have had it any other way. The end came\
  \ too quickly and leaving Costa Rica I realized that this first cannot be my last.\
  \ In just a week I understood more about myself than ever before. The solitude,\
  \ self-reliance and new relationships were eye opening. They were also addicting.\
  \ On the plane ride home I made a vow that I would do another solo trip next year.\
  \ I write this en route to Thailand."
