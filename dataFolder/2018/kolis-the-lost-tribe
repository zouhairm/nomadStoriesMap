Text: "The ceaseless movement of masses in every direction looks like a live video\
  \ being played in rapid fast forward. Nobody stops because there is no place to\
  \ stop. With scores of people moving in each day, the constantly growing city experiences\
  \ transformation every single hour. In the m\xE9lange of people, languages and cultures\
  \ that has taken place in this fantastic little city, there is someone who has lost\
  \ their identity. While Mumbai\u2019s choking humidity makes us all amphibians,\
  \ the one I\u2019m talking about is an amphibian in roughly the true sense of the\
  \ term. Although they live on land, the sea is where they feel at home. They are\
  \ the aboriginal tribe of Mumbai - the Kolis. \nDespite being peace-loving, Kolis\
  \ are undoubtedly excitable. A typical conversation between them often leads to\
  \ a squabble in which abuses are exchanged without a hitch. This may sound like\
  \ an exaggeration, but a Koli sentence always begins with a vulgar sobriquet. Everything\
  \ about the community is loud; from their voice to their choice. You will never\
  \ find a Kolin/fishermwoman dressed in pastel shades and nor a soft mellow voice.\
  \ These women are content with their smuttiness but are generally kind hearted.\
  \ \nIn the early wee hours fisherwomen usually squat on the floor of local trains\
  \ with their heavy baskets. Most train brawls are a result of exits being blocked\
  \ by the kolins as they sit cleaning prawns and yapping loudly in the gangway. Other\
  \ women hold their neatly pleated sarees and flowing dresses well above their ankles\
  \ and gingerly tip-toe around them to avoid any close encounters. If you hold your\
  \ nose due to the offensive smell, the kolins will snap at you in annoyance. God\
  \ help you if you dare to object to her stinking fish! She\u2019ll not just threaten\
  \ to douche you with fish water. I have witnessed a wrathful fisherwoman fling a\
  \ fish rather accurately at a well-dressed young woman reducing her to tears! Fishermen,\
  \ however, rarely go beyond the harbour unless they are returning to their koliwada\
  \ (settlement of the Kolis). They are mostly engaged in fishing. Many have now begun\
  \ working at sea food export factories. The\_fish market and sale of fish is exclusively\
  \ monopolized by the kolins. \nAlthough they are indigenous to the region and continue\
  \ to influence the panorama of cultural flux here, they are gradually being stirred\
  \ to social extinction. The Kolis\_are losing their land and craft in the eternal\
  \ struggle for their existence."
