Text: "All of us were standing in the different life roads at least once. Which path\
  \ did you choose? Was it easy, hard, straight or entangle one? However, they connected\
  \ you with your recent reality and directed to move on or to surrender. \nEvery\
  \ second, minute and hour people create new links and they sync with material and\
  \ non-material parts of society. I took my minute too. Desperate decision made me\
  \ to come to the interview instead of enjoying March air. After three hours I found\
  \ out that I am going to work abroad and live there for 6 months, because I got\
  \ strict \u201CYES\u201D. One month was in a rush. Study should be completed, documents\
  \ have to be sent, luggage must be gathered and braveness might come\u2026\nWelcome\
  \ to Turkey! Merhabalar! New job, new rules, new ambience came in my life. Transfer\
  \ representative guide looked at me from the mirror. I thought that uniform is just\
  \ a cloth, but it was not truth. It encouraged my soul to interact with citizens,\
  \ to develop my communicate skills, to accompany tourists and see Turkish landmarks\
  \ from the foreign worker side. I made a local connection with people and nature\
  \ without realizing that. My inner world was conquered by Turkey and it became wider.\
  \ I worked hard. I even slept in my uniform. But I still adored every second of\
  \ gazing beauty that surrounded me with its colors: tourists' screams, angry drivers\
  \ and demanding office. All of them could not exist when you were watching Turkish\
  \ mountains, breathe pine air, become wet because of subtropical climate and driving\
  \ near of infinity blue sea line. You forget every trouble when you taste ayran,\
  \ bread ring (simit) and watch when your mouthwatering doner kebab is preparing.\
  \ Delicious! \nProbably you can say that it is a description of common weekend,\
  \ but when you analyze deeper you see the difference. Experience routine is a first\
  \ local connection that can be excepted as a usual thing. It is very embarrassing\
  \ and just open your eyes on your own Motherland and its traditions. We may search\
  \ for new impressions, buy expensive tours, go to the most popular destinations\
  \ and still feel empty. But there is a medicine! It is when you glance at the new\
  \ landmarks and do it with wise look that is full of comparison tint. After your\
  \ try to compare you are able to realize that there is no need to do that. You should\
  \ enjoy the process of local connection and do it without some intentions.\nMaking\
  \ a local connection means to let yourself to this world as well as it will enrich\
  \ your inward."
