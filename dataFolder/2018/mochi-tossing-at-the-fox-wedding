Text: "The Suo-hanaoka fox festival is an old celebration. Tradition says that foxes\
  \ would get married at this time, bringing good luck for the harvest all across\
  \ southern Japan.I was told it was mainly for kids, this was evident by the cotton\
  \ candy and stalls offer small toys as prizes. After sampling some of the festival\
  \ food, and enjoying the atmosphere, I found the main stage.  After a while, two\
  \ regally dressed actors emerged. Their kimonos were made of the finest silk, beautiful\
  \ embroidery stretched from their shoulders to their feet. \nThey sat upon a throne,\
  \ both wearing a fox masks. Expressionlessly, their fox masks looked out at the\
  \ crowd. \nIn Japanese culture foxes love the traditional rice cake dessert; mochi.\
  \ mochi is made from pounding rice until it becomes a sticky paste, then tearing\
  \ it into balls that harden. After being warmed up, these balls soften again. Part\
  \ of the festival was to show the foxes love of mochi by passing it out to children\
  \ in the crowd.\nChildren came to the front of the crowd, each holding a bag to\
  \ try and catch sweet in, like a net. It was cute and seemed like good fun, then\
  \ the fox actors pulled out the mochi.\nThe crowd all leapt to their feet. This\
  \ was quite impressive as almost everyone around me was well over seventy years\
  \ old. There was bobbing and weaving in attempts to get in the best position. I\
  \ looked around, confused at the old people. Wasn\u2019t this for kids? Then the\
  \ bombardment started.\nThe foxes started hurling mochi into the crowd, not just\
  \ at the kids but to where I was standing too. A ball of mochi hit my sunglasses,\
  \ knocking a lens loose. It was at this point I realised the mochi was uncooked.\
  \ It was still hard. Rocks of mochi continued to rain down from the stage. They\
  \ seemed to have bottomless bags and the arms of professional baseball players.\
  \ As ball after ball struck me, with bruise making potential, I was also being attacked\
  \ on all sides by people older than my grandparents. \nmochi was falling to the\
  \ ground. Nobody was able to grab it because of the inescapable scrum. An old woman\
  \ darted between my legs, grabbing every ball that she could. An old man elbowed\
  \ me sharply in the ribs as he tried to catch mochi that continued to rain down.\
  \ Another woman grabbed mochi that had fallen into my hood. It was absolute madness.\
  \ \nFinally the bombardment stopped. The elderly Japanese returned to their polite,\
  \ reserved selves. I had only caught two mochi."
