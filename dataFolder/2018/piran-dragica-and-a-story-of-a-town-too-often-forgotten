Text: "It's ten in the morning and the gentle buzz of homemade brandy served with\
  \ breakfast by our host, Dragica, is setting in. \"Orahova\u010Da\" is good for\
  \ the digestion, she says with a hand on her belly.\n\nMy wife Geneva and I are\
  \ in Piran, Slovenia, on the coast of the Adriatic Sea. We arrived at the B&B the\
  \ night before, having walked through narrow Old Town streets. Here Dragica owns\
  \ two apartments, one which she inhabits during the off-season, and where sometimes\
  \ she serves breakfast in the morning. She speaks only a little English, but the\
  \ banter flows smoothly with a mutual mix of words and animated arm gestures.\n\n\
  Piran's Old Town is closed to cars; you'll need to walk half a mile from a parking\
  \ lot to get there. Tourists crowd to town in summer, but a serene quietness flows\
  \ through it during our October visit.\n\nOver a breakfast of pala\u010Dinkas-cr\xEA\
  pes-the conversation moves to Croatia. Dragica hails from Zadar and thinks we'd\
  \ find Split and Dubrovnik more interesting than Piran. That is hard to fathom.\n\
  \nPiran was founded 2,000 years ago as part of the Roman Empire. In the 7th century,\
  \ it took its name from the Greek word for \"red\"-\"pyrrhos\"-for the color of\
  \ stones found around town.\n\nFew things have changed over the years. The Church\
  \ of St. George still surveys Piran from its hill, and there is a towering monument\
  \ honoring hometown composer Giuseppe Tartini in the main square. Remains of the\
  \ Walls of Piran still stands millennia later. \n\nWe learn Dragica is a part-time\
  \ gardener in a lavender field outside of town. Her B&B takes up most of her time,\
  \ but her knowledge of herbology is  profound. As we politely turn down the fourth\
  \ shot of brandy, she pulls out bottles of herbal tonics and a book of illustrations\
  \ with Slovene and English titles. Pointing to a bottle, she finds pictures of mint\
  \ and apples: They cure headaches. Rose oil takes care of sunburn. Ginger, toothache.\n\
  \nLocal products are prevalent through Piran. As opposed to many towns in the area,\
  \ you will find few tourist-shops here. Salt is a common commodity, and the proprietor\
  \ of Casa Nostromo, a local restaurant we visited, told us Gordon Ramsey uses the\
  \ Solnce brand.\n\nWe have bantered with Dragica half the morning, and as we start\
  \ to leave for our next destination, she quickly bags up a bottle of orahova\u010D\
  a and an assortment of tonics for us. \"For your health.\"\n   \nPiran is, above\
  \ history and scenery, a friendly town, one where a few words with a B&B host can\
  \ evolve into a genuine human connection."
