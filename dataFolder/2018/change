Text: "Change is good, or so I thought. \nIt was the end of my first year of university\
  \ and with a new found independence. I had packed my bags and was headed for my\
  \ first solo travelling expedition. My dream was always to visit the clear waters\
  \ of Ponta do Ouro and experience life in semi-isolation with only the company of\
  \ beaches, food and the handful of locals who preferred living this way.\nEager\
  \ to start my journey and become a fully-fledged grown woman I headed straight to\
  \ Mozambique without hesitation or procrastination. Whatever troubles I had in the\
  \ real world were to be left in Cape Town for the next seven days and all I had\
  \ to worry about was not getting food poisoning. \nMy journey started off slowly\
  \ and comfortably, I felt a little too comfortable. The small town which has no\
  \ tarred roads and can only be reached by 4x4 provided me with a sense relaxation\
  \ and fresh air I needed. For the first two or three days I spent most of my tie\
  \ in the water (attempting to see as many dolphins as possible because they were\
  \ one of the main reasons I chose to come to Ponta). Swimming, surf and sun. Not\
  \ to mention of the best off shore diving sites I\u2019ve visited with amazing visibility\
  \ and diverse marine life. The uninterrupted sound of crashing waves and birds chirping,\
  \ what more could a girl ask for?\nLots more, a girl could ask for lots more. By\
  \ day four I was craving someone to talk to. Someone I could share life-changing\
  \ moments with. A friend who understood that I am growing into what I\u2019m meant\
  \ to be and with whom I could grow with. Yes, isolation and independence are key\
  \ parts in maturing but at that present moment I required a friend. Thinking of\
  \ the friends I left back home without giving a second thought to, I started to\
  \ wonder who would truly appreciate the moments of human silence and natural white\
  \ noise of crashing waves. \u201CWould any of my friends appreciate this?\u201D\
  \ I thought.\n With my trip soon ending I decide to come into contact with a few\
  \ locals, there aren\u2019t many places to visit besides the petro station, bank,\
  \ pharmacy, hardware store and fresh produce market. To my surprise I happen upon\
  \ a friend seeking the same thing as me, how\u2026fortunate? We spend our final\
  \ days in Ponta together, doing things we equally love. I felt as though I needed\
  \ to completely change the way I lived my life and that being independent meant\
  \ being completely alone. Growth is good, but even better with a friend."
