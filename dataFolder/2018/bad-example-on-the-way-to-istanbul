Text: "This story could have been an international scandal, it happened to me on the\
  \ way to Istanbul from Donetsk. How I managed to prevent it, and what I have gotten\
  \ for that?\nI have to start from plane, my husband is afraid to fly, so all most\
  \ always he is drunk on board. This time was not an exception. Have you ever tried\
  \ to argue or to prove something to a 1,84 meters-high man, who contains 2 litters\
  \ of beer and some quantity of whisky inside him? I didn`t get used to that, since\
  \ in everyday life he usually does`t drink so much. I felt myself small and week\
  \ mouse near this giant not sober guy. But I had no choice \u2014 I switched on\
  \ so-called mode \"Ukrainian wife\", as my husband named it.\_\nI didn`t shout at\
  \ him, no: it`s useless and sometimes dangerous. I just hid the bottle of Jameson.\
  \ It was very self-confident move. He was pissed off certainly.\nProbably you won`t\
  \ believe me, but he remembered the last news he red about the airplanes.\_Legendary\
  \ French actor G\xE9rard Depardieu caused quite a scene on an airplane by urinating\
  \ in the cabin in front of his fellow passengers after the crew told him he had\
  \ to wait to use the toilet.\nAfter that my husband decided to repeat the feat of\
  \ the actor with the words \"What I am worse than him\"? The meaning of this phrase\
  \ and role of\_\_G\xE9rard Depardieu in it\_he explained me later and sober, when\
  \ he was apologising by buying me a sheepskin coat, which Turkey is famous for.\_\
  \nAnyway I decided to use extreme measures meanwhile he was trying to undress. Thanks\
  \ God drunk people are clumsy, that gave me time to say: \"If you won`t stop \u2014\
  \ they will land you, and we are now 10 km higher than usually. They won`t give\
  \ you a parachute\". To my surprise this crazy warning was effective: he grumbled\
  \ for a couple of minuets and went to sleep.\_\nAfter such stressful adventure Istanbul\
  \ appeared before me like a melody of East \u2014 sunrise over Golden Horn bay seemed\
  \ Heaven. Hundreds of fishers on the bridge, the sun touching winter sea, birds\
  \ and cats fighting for food \u2014 that was a first impression from Istanbul. Oh,\
  \ and the tramway, of course \u2014 we used it to get to the hotel.\_\nRestaurants\
  \ and barkers near them, the voice of waves, mussels with lemon at every turn, cosy\
  \ barbershops, the sound of muezzin's calling muslims to pray, apple tea in little\
  \ transparent glasses, energetic seagulls above the minarets and terrific eastern\_\
  sweet-stuff \u2014 this is what I remember. And clearly Turkish\_sheepskin coat\
  \ will be warm me during long cold Ukrainian winters."
