Text: "The sun relentlessly beat down, making my hair hot to the touch. Heat and humidity\
  \ from the morning storm clung to every inch of my body in the form of wet, sticky\
  \ sweat. There was no way to escape the heavy warmth of this island-nation located\
  \ one-degree north of the equator, other than to take refuge inside an overly air-conditioned\
  \ shopping center that screamed luxury.\n \nRather than seeking refuge indoors I\
  \ paid a visit to a man tending to an ice cream cart. A large, rainbow beach umbrella\
  \ generously shaded both. My craving for something cold accompanied the clacking\
  \ sound of brown, double-strap sandals against the manicured pathway as I made a\
  \ beeline toward the oasis.\n \nManning the cart was a middle-aged man with a gray,\
  \ receding hairline and tan, mocha-colored skin. The smile lines around his mouth\
  \ and eyes kindly complimented his laid back demeanor. My savior\u2019s outfit:\
  \ a well-worn white t-shirt tucked into khaki cargo shorts paired with black slip-on\
  \ sandals.\n\nSinglish cut through the blanket of afternoon humidity: \u201CWhat\
  \ you like, lah?\u201D\n \nSnapping out of a heat-induced daze, I placed my order,\
  \ \u201CTaro please, Uncle.\u201D\n \nWith years of ice cream wisdom, the Ice Cream\
  \ Uncle pulled out a large, rectangular package of taro ice cream. He expertly cut\
  \ through the frosty, light purple slab, ensuring to peel off the thin layer of\
  \ cardboard that tightly embraced the perfectly-sliced block before gingerly selecting\
  \ a piece of fluffy sweet bread swirled with bright green, orange, and pink colors.\
  \ Cupping the pastel bread slice in one hand, Uncle delicately positioned the creamy\
  \ taro block in the middle of the bread with his other.\n \nHe held out the sandwich,\
  \ lightly chuckling. Obviously noticing my confusion about his laughter, Uncle motioned\
  \ up. I jerked my head toward the bright blue sky expecting a Merlion to be swimming\
  \ above\u2014only hung the umbrella.\n \n\u201CSame, same!\u201D he said, pointing\
  \ first to my ice cream sandwich and then the umbrella.\n \nA couldn't help but\
  \ to smile and giggle. My very literal ice cream sandwich matched the vibrant colors\
  \ of the umbrella, which had been dutifully protecting us throughout this exchange.\
  \ With hands on hips, Uncle let out a short, satisfied sigh at the end of his chuckle\
  \ in response to this epiphany.\n \nI had momentarily forgotten about the Singaporean\
  \ heat, as the easygoing Ice Cream Uncle had refreshed my spirit. My one-dollar\
  \ piece of luxury began to melt in my hand, adding to the day\u2019s stickiness\
  \ while it dripped down my arm."
