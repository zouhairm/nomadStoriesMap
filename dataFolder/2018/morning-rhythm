Text: "Golden morning sunlight dapples through the crisp autumn air, teasing at an\
  \ Indian summer as the day begins. As I step into the Place des Vosges, this light\
  \ makes me look twice at the regal facades, the pink and gold stones sat atop arcades\
  \ cast in shadow. It is a spectacle of a square, so confident in its splendour and\
  \ the history passing through it. \nI remember the first time I came here. The first\
  \ stop on a jam-packed twelve hour itinerary, meticulously crafted by two eager\
  \ seventeen year olds. We sat on the cream wicker chairs outside a caf\xE9, with\
  \ pain aux raisins and a view onto the fenced park, its fountains pattering in the\
  \ brisk spring morning.\_ We unfolded annotated maps, smudged and creased with weeks\
  \ of anticipation. With the taste of butter in our mouths we wandered around the\
  \ square twice, peering into gallery windows, up the stairs of Victor Hugo\u2019\
  s house and through open doors to a sumptuous hotel courtyard beyond.\nToday this\
  \ same place is shaped by different a feeling. Anticipation replaced by trepidation,\
  \ carefree curious adventure is now hopefulness tinged with uncertainty and self\
  \ doubt. I am making this city my home, this is my new routine.\nI cross the road,\
  \ under an archway and past the same caf\xE9. The delightful smell of warm butter\
  \ and sugar turns my head and I peer into the window, at the rows of jewel like\
  \ macaroons, and swirls of perfect flaky pastry. A man with round tortoiseshell\
  \ glasses sits in the corner, reading a newspaper. He looks up and we glance at\
  \ each other briefly as I walk by.\nI fall into a rhythm. Rushing under the arcades\
  \ for brief respite from the rain, glancing out across the park to a pale sky tinged\
  \ with the remains of the sunrise. The cobbles undulate beneath my feet as I rush\
  \ to start the day. My eyes shift to the caf\xE9 ahead, to the corner seat beneath\
  \ the heater. Cream jumper, scarf, newspaper open and coat over the back of the\
  \ wicker chair. I walk past, we glance and then smile in recognition, then the next\
  \ day in acknowledgement. \nIn all the grandeur of this city, our quotidiens briefly\
  \ align. I start to sense a shift towards a deeper feeling of belonging: the city\
  \ accepts my rhythms as much as the next person, my story enters into its folds.\
  \ \nCoat wrapped tight around me, I march and brace against the wind as it whistles\
  \ through the corridors. I look up and smile, he smiles back and mouths:\n\xAB\_\
  Bonjour\_\xBB\n\xAB\_Bonjour\_\xBB, I murmur back."
