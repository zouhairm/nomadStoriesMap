Text: "My heart is full of emotions, I can hardly breathe and my mind is not firm.\
  \ Joanna's continuous falls force me to plant the pickaxe in the ice to anchor me\
  \ do not ending up in one of the ravines that open up between the glaciers. The\
  \ guide continues to repeat \"rapido chicos, rapido\" while Joanna looks at him\
  \ with a blind and irrational hatred.\nThe sun has just appeared, but it seems that\
  \ it is already midday, so strong is the light that is reflected on the desert of\
  \ ice and snow that surrounds us. \n\"Tenemos que ir rapido, el hielo podria derretirse.\"\
  \nThe umpteenth time Joanna falls, I realize that her pants are stained between\
  \ the legs. I look at the guide worried, he does not react and whispers: \"Rapido\
  \ chicos, rapido.\"\nI try to help Joanna but, when I offer her my hand, she chases\
  \ me badly.\nIn the following minutes I start to swerve too, I cling several times\
  \ to the rope that joins us: me, a proud skinny Polish post-teenager and a former\
  \ Bolivian military.\nI keel over trying to recover some oxygen.\nOnly at that moment\
  \ my mind recalls the decision to climb the Huayna Potos\xEC: I was sitting in a\
  \ bar in La Paz with Stefanie. In front of me a plate of Fricase and a flyer found\
  \ by chance in a hostel that said \"the world's easiest 6000 metres climb\". She\
  \ laughed: \"Look, there you won't have a taxi to bring you home!\"\nMy head is\
  \ spinning, I have to rest, I ask my companions for a few minutes stop. The guide\
  \ gives me a silent placet sign moving imperceptibly his head. Giovanna is already\
  \ on the ground.\nThe panorama at 6 thousand meters is extraordinary: infinite peaks,\
  \ clear sky, rarefied air. With all the equipment on I look as an astronaut. \n\
  We woke up at midnight to face the climb at night to avoid facing the descent from\
  \ the summit during a late spring morning. \nI realize I need to uncover a bit my\
  \ body, the sun at these heights seems to burn.\nWith my ass sitting firmly on the\
  \ side of the mountain and looking towards the horizon I feel that I still have\
  \ a shred of strength.\nGiovanna seems to perceive that I have recovered some energy\
  \ and turns to me in English pointing at the guide: \"I do not like that guy, he\
  \ talks to me only in Spanish and I do not understand it! The agency told me that\
  \ he would have to speak to me in English!\u201D I do not know exactly why, but\
  \ I fix her for a few seconds, then I start laughing. First softly and then, gradually,\
  \ noisier. I can not stop myself anymore."
