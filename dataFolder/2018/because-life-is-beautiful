Text: 'My boyfriend and I decided to go to Zanzibar for a week.one day we were sitting
  outside and taking pictures.we were the only guests at this small lodge At the time.after
  spotting the restaurant waitress,I asked him to take us a picture.mind you we still
  had the phone on selfie mode.we handed him the phone.he doesn''t speak English at
  al,so we had to gesture.

  While the waiter had the phone,he kept ducking and moving side to side as if trying
  to get out of the picture and trying to find us on the screen.he then handed us
  the phone and that''s when we realised he didn''t know how to turn the screen and
  all we found were really funny close ups of his face.we all had a great laugh about
  it.


  Another time,I ordered fish for lunch,so again English is not known on the island
  but they get some words.so I asked the chef if he could show me what type of fish
  it was,he kept opening his hands so as to gesture a big fish,and I didn''t really
  get this,in his frustration he calls me to the kitchen and shows me the biggest
  fish I''ve ever seen.i excused myself and let the man do what he does best.


  The people are the friendliest.while walking you can simply come up to people greet
  them,and they would all start inviting you to sit with them.the feeling of acceptance
  and them trying to tell stories in English is just precious.you would have children
  come up to you and tell you a word in English then run away laughing at each other
  and obviously shy.we take bikes and ride along the water.

  This relates so much to me in my county because we like to know so much about what
  else is out there.how do people live,walk even sleep.'
