Text: "When my foot hit the wet pavement as I got out of the cab in front of this\
  \ old dark run-down Surrey Motel, I thought to myself that I really might be out\
  \ of my element here. I took a moment to get my bearings and surveyed the Motel.\
  \ It looked as though it hadn\u2019t been occupied in years. With the broken windows,\
  \ paint peeling off the black rotten wood siding, and the front door was off its\
  \ hinges. There were piles of discarded clothes, garbage, broken bikes and syringes\
  \ surrounding the property. Through the windows, you could see piles of junk along\
  \ with makeshift window dressings hanging haphazardly from the frames, made from\
  \ either old dirty blankets or sheets.\n\nMy friend John ushered me through the\
  \ vacant parking lot to the front door of the Motel, we stepped through the open\
  \ doorway, being careful not to knock the glass door further off its hinges. At\
  \ the top of the staircase was a long hallway lined with motel rooms. The hallway\
  \ was littered with more junk and there were stains along the walls and carpet.\
  \ We made our way down the hall and John listed off who occupied each suite. Most\
  \ of the rooms had no doors on them, you could see people smoking from glass pipes\
  \ in one room and tying their arms off with needles in hand in the next. I had no\
  \ idea what I had gotten myself into at this point. \n\nWe continued along the hall\
  \ until we reached our destination. A room that was bare other than a single bed,\
  \ a stool and a pile of books stacked in the corner. The man that occupied the suite\
  \ was a former high school English teacher named Stu. He was down on his luck and\
  \ had ended up living in this awful place. The other occupants of the motel had\
  \ given him a nickname of Papa Stu. He had become a Librarian of sorts in this place.\
  \ \n\nPapa Stu had accidentally earned this title when helping a neighbor one night\
  \ who was dope sick. She could not sleep from the pain and was suffering. Papa Stu\
  \ helped ease her angst by reading her one of his many books. This helped distract\
  \ her from the pain and put her mind at ease. He had stayed with her all night,\
  \ all the while reading aloud. People heard of what Papa Stu had done and he quickly\
  \ became a source of distraction for the many that reside here. Offering a selection\
  \ of titles, he would lend out using the honor system. Some of the residents he\
  \ had even taught to read, leading him to be given the name Papa Stu. \n\nWho would\
  \ have thought that a place of like this would have a library? This is the last\
  \ thing I would have expected."
