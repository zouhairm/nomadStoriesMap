Text: "A Buddhist style hotel, peaked roofs mimicking the crests and troughs of mountains\
  \ behind. A zen garden which reaches to the banks of a river. Arms rise and return\
  \ to heart centre as we practise Qi Gong. Dawn turns the sky lilac and lights up\
  \ the mountains. Locals come and wash their clothes in the river, also preparing\
  \ for the day. Far away in the hills a tiger prowls, an elusive panda shifts in\
  \ its seat.\n\nA boardroom, hammer and sickle the lone adornment. Our entourage\
  \ circles the table. Young, crew cut Russian MMA fighters sit with our Chinese interpreter.\
  \ A benevolent local billionaire, cigar in mouth, discusses plans to build a health\
  \ city in this remote place. Chrysanthemum flowers glow in my tea as I observe,\
  \ wondering what outsiders would make of such a scene. \n\nMidday. The sun sears\
  \ my head. Overheating, I rush to safety, racing the migraine taking hold. Our tai\
  \ chi masters, Liu and Chen, find me. Lying me down they massage my temples, neck\
  \ and ears.  Chen draws his hand across my face. The pain disappears. I fall asleep.\
  \ \n\nAnother boardroom takes us by surprise. Official air contrasts with my gym\
  \ gear. Red placards denote our Chinglish names: Grubby, Eagle...Rasoul (Sol). We\
  \ sit with our pseudonyms as the billionaire conducts ceremonies. Photos are taken\
  \ and we solemnly sign to remain lifelong ambassadors of the region. Liu clasps\
  \ his hands together, thanking Eagle. Our contingent has secured his place in the\
  \ future city\u2019s plans.  \n\nEvening. Liu takes my 1000 yen bill and Sol holds\
  \ a chopstick in his hands. My bill flashes through the air and cuts the chopstick\
  \ in two. Amused by my awe, Liu takes another chopstick to his adam\u2019s apple,\
  \ pushing it in. He flexes, and the chopstick flies outwards in splinters. I want\
  \ to see more, but Eagle, his master, chides him. A frivolous way to expel your\
  \ energy.\n\nMist. We\u2019re atop Tiantangzhai, 5000ft above sea level. A glass\
  \ skywalk reaches into a blanket of white. On a clear day, tourists come to walk\
  \ upon glass and buckle at the sight of the valley floor far below. Today the effect\
  \ is lost. White obscures all. We are enveloped in muffled, expansive clouds. I\
  \ walk on glass. Mist swallows the others, I am lost in space. I like it up here.\
  \ There is something comforting about the unknown, a security to knowing you\u2019\
  re once again alone. Liu's face swirls in the mist and I am content. For although\
  \ the continuity of transience ceases not, be moments fleeting, no feature is forgot.\
  \ \n\nWe scatter across the world."
