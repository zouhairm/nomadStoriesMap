Text: "Guidebooks; they sit on shelves in libraries and wait for curious selection.\
  \ They are dust collectors, paper weights\u2026for some. Years ago, I noticed the\
  \ large, embossed, black guidebook situated on the bookshelf in my house; intriguing.\
  \ It was hefty, an actual book rather than a leaflet, and stocked full of vibrant,\
  \ poignant photographs of \u201CThe House on the Rock\u201D, an apparently magical\
  \ place of light and hording. Only a few page turns convinced me that I would one\
  \ day arrive at this oddity. I never dreamed it would take me ten years. \n And\
  \ to think I would be greeted by dragons; dragons of metal, shoddily nailed and\
  \ wired to pots larger than the SUV which had brought me to the middle of everywhere.\
  \ I squinted up at the dragon, and its accompanying ostentatious lizard friend.\
  \ If they had some warning to issue about the labyrinth ahead of me, they felt no\
  \ need to provide it. Wisconsin seems like an odd place for such a spectacle, a\
  \ hand built house at unreasonable height with covered bridges strung betwixt structures.\
  \ I peered over the edge of a bridge into the undergrowth. Perhaps the inspiration\
  \ for the faux dragons dwelt below. \n We entered the house, formerly home to the\
  \ eccentric architect who wrought and filled his home as a place of timber, glass,\
  \ and glory. The living quarters was dark, dark enough that carpeting was placed\
  \ on low beams in case tall guests failed to notice them. Narrow as well, the passages\
  \ would crisscross until they abruptly dumped the curious tourists into a tiny kitchen\u2026\
  a piano room with an archaic chandelier\u2026a room filled with self-playing, mechanical\
  \ instruments, all widely out of tune. This mini-world was ornate, elegant, with\
  \ an aura of desiccation. Everything revealed the dreams of a man whose tastes ran\
  \ in the artistic lines of his time; his small universe reflected the world as was\
  \ extant. Yet it was built in his image, which meant the ceilings were about 5\u2019\
  \ 8\u201D tall, 3\u201D too low for me to be comfortable.\n Discomfort; the whole\
  \ place was built on angles, tension between wood and metal, pushing people away,\
  \ drawing them in, altering their perspective. The Infinity Room epitomized this,\
  \ a thin needle stretching out over the forest. Supported only by the strength of\
  \ physics, the room lured me out into the void. A window cut into the floor allowed\
  \ me a sense of my own mortality, forcing me to reflect on the madness of a man\
  \ who would build such a place\u2026and the madness of someone who had waited 10\
  \ years to see it."
