Text: "I traveled to japan in 2016 for a business course, I had traveled to Europe\
  \ and North America prior to the opportunity to be in Japan, but the Japanese experience\
  \ was beyond imagination.  The touchdown at Tokyo brought immense joy, I was finally\
  \ in Asia. My next stop was Narita airport en route to Nagoya. I wished I had the\
  \ opportunity to tour Tokyo for a day, as advised by friends who had been to Tokyo,\
  \ the description of exotic and beautiful structures encapsulated my mind with so\
  \ much desire to behold the magnificence of the innovation of the city.\n I visited\
  \ various prefectures in japan with each having its uniqueness. One captivating\
  \ experience was the flora and fauna of Japan, the trees grew in the wholesomeness\
  \ of colorful beauty, like they were artificially placed to add glamour to the streets\
  \ and numerous tourist destinations. It called for the capture of memories while\
  \ basking in the euphoria of beauty of all in sight, including the beautiful, gigantic,\
  \ architectural designs. Regarding the amazing trees, I perceived they would be\
  \ generally green in the rainy season and brown during dry seasons, as is the case\
  \ in Africa, rather, they were as boldly colorful like flowers? They appeared like\
  \ replicas of giant colorful bouquets, but so much to make a tree. They were lemon,\
  \ and dark shades of orange in combination with greens.  They were heavenly captivating,\
  \ and absolutely beautiful. \nWe visited Kyomizu-Dera in Kyoto, We had to walk uphill\
  \ with loads of human traffic that made walking a daunting task, and we constantly\
  \ experienced stops as the traffic increased. The temple has a fountain of water\
  \ that is revered and said to have special healing powers, and its efficacy was\
  \ highly emphasized. Shortly after leaving the temple we visited a company that\
  \ processes fresh oysters. We were offered uncooked fresh oysters on arrival. I\
  \ am not so much of a lover of sea foods, especially fresh ones. Suddenly, I decided,\
  \ I was going to take the chance, but I was highly worried I could puke in the attempt\
  \ to prove I could adapt to unusual cuisines. I took the oyster, applied a bit of\
  \ lemon on it as provided, and then hurriedly chased it down my throat. I Held my\
  \ breath while waiting for the feeling of nausea, but it never came, and I felt\
  \ utmost joy that I took the decision. I felt absolutely comfortable afterwards,\
  \ and that was by far \u201Ca decision that pushed me to the edge\u201D."
