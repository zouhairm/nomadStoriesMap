Text: "I'm not ashamed to say that I'm a typical millennial from Australia who worked\
  \ a part-time job whilst completing university just to save enough money to go on\
  \ exchange where I spend more time making local friends and experiencing their culture\
  \ rather than laboriously learning my subjects. But my story doesn't begin at the\
  \ University of Virginia, a public college located in an isolated and rural suburb,\
  \ Charlottesville. \n\nMy story begins on a typical Greyhound heading into a city\
  \ I've never been but have always dreamed of visiting thanks to Hollywood. I slump\
  \ into my chair in the Greyhound bus departing from Silver Springs, Maryland. I\
  \ reach into my bag for my phone charger but I couldn't find it. I panic a little.\
  \ My phone is the only thing connecting my foreignness to the local habitat of the\
  \ East Coast. I must've left it at my friend's house last night. \n\n\"I don't mean\
  \ to be rude, but I want to let you know that you can use my charger.\" I turn to\
  \ my left hearing this voice. A friendly young adult my age must've heard me rustling\
  \ through my bag and saw my dejection. \"Just let me know.\" I thanked her warmly\
  \ and eventually asked her for it to power up my lifeline. \n\nTime goes by when\
  \ you're on an adventure, or when you fall asleep. A sudden jolt of the bus woke\
  \ me up and I nearly cried when I saw the outline of the horizon. Not a knock-out\
  \ to my face could convince me that I was seeing this historically rich and culturally\
  \ mixed city. \n\nI meet my friend at the station and we made our way to our Airbnb.\
  \ We were on the 3rd floor but the building had no elevators. It's common. Our room\
  \ was tiny, the whole street seemed so dense, but our lack of money being students\
  \ made us truly live the way locals do. We became friends with our friendly neighbour,\
  \ Mark, who helped us get around.\n\nWe visited North, South, East, and West. Every\
  \ village we turned to, every borough we visited were marked with iconic landscapes\
  \ and architecture. History was all around us, but at the same time, the people\
  \ there were making history. Everyone was from everywhere. Different languages were\
  \ spoken in every direction. The poverty, too, was real and prominent, juxtaposed\
  \ with the palaces, Kings, and Queens around us. \n\nWhile the restless city made\
  \ me want to leave badly, the moment I left, all I wanted to do was to go back immediately.\
  \ I can't even call it a city; I see it more as a small country. Taking off, I wave\
  \ good-bye to the city that never sleeps. I simply love New York, New York."
