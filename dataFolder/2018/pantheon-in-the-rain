Text: "Breathing in the crisp February air I knew a storm was on the way, and one\
  \ should never let a rainy day in Rome go to waste. So where do I venture when the\
  \ clouds roll in, the skies have opened up, and the Gods weep over the passing of\
  \ Apollo? Well, to the best preserved Ancient Roman monument, the Pantheon, that\
  \ survived the barbarian raids that left the rest of Rome in ruins and my favorite\
  \ building. With howling winds at my back and my umbrella fighting to survive, I\
  \ am glad to finally be out of the storm and relieved to see the weather had reduced\
  \ the everyday chaos of the tourist invasion. Some days just the thought of the\
  \ crowd\u2019s disarray makes me uneasy. Thankful for the rain I am able to skip\
  \ the turmoil of crowd mentality- everyone mindlessly becoming cattle, suffocatingly\
  \ pushing you as you pray to the divine that paradise is just beyond the temples\
  \ doorway. But when you finally break through the barriers of people the feeling\
  \ of insignificance intensifies and our merely mortal eyes cannot even begin to\
  \ comprehend the physical size of this great monument. How tiny we really are in\
  \ the grand scheme of things. Having visited countless times I still find myself\
  \ lost in its stunning glory. I sink into a wooden pew and exhale a breath of gratitude\
  \ for sanctuary from the malicious tears raging outside. Inside, the sound of the\
  \ thundering rain wraps you in a transcendent feeling, as if the gods themselves\
  \ are gathering in around you, in a careful, caressing grasp making sure you are\
  \ there and reminding you of the history within these ancient stones. Watching the\
  \ water dancing along the marble floor, it invites you to follow the glistening\
  \ glimpses as the flow of the stream willingly reveals the genius behind why this\
  \ magnificent building never floods. The temple, built on a slight angle causes\
  \ the leakage from the ceiling to flood to the front alter where carved into the\
  \ marble floor are small drains that one can easily miss. Never did I expect to\
  \ find such serenity in a country I barely know. Engulfing you into the timeless\
  \ wonder the sound is unlike any I have ever heard, natures music to the ears, welcoming\
  \ you with it\u2019s peaceful melody. Losing track of time I watch the rain fall\
  \ from the ceiling, the drops hitting the marble floor created a tempo of enchanting\
  \ echoes. I feel in these moments that this is what people mean when they speak\
  \ of magic, just a breath of fresh rainwater, the sound of time standing still,\
  \ if only until the storm has passed."
