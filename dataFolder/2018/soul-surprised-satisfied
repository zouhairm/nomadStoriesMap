Text: "\"Liberation of the soul\" a feeling not very common, but sometimes the most\
  \ unexpected surprise brings us just that. A journey from the concrete jungle of\
  \ the garden city, Bengaluru to the lush expanses for the backwaters of Kerala gives\
  \ us many a sight that brings about a euphoria of happiness but there are times\
  \ we look out in awe at the beauty for mother nature. one such moment i s what i\
  \ did experience on such a trip.\n A night train from Bengaluru to Kayankulam is\
  \ a journey time of about fourteen hours. After a pleasant sleep I was woken up\
  \ by the sunrise with rays trickling through the curtain. The vendors on the train\
  \ were serving hot breakfast with coffee. We were tracing a route on the banks of\
  \ a seasonal river Bharathapuhza. The dry river bed was prominent with a sizable\
  \ stream flowing calmly. Lined with cocunut plantations on the banks, this would\
  \ have made a  perfect portrait if captured on the canvass. We moved out of Ottapalam\
  \ station where the train had a short halt. The gently rocking of the train was\
  \ turning breakfast into a tricky situation. About five minutes out there, was a\
  \ sight that I least expected. The train was now crossing the river and down the\
  \ river bed was a sparkle of the stream kissed by the gentle rays of the morning\
  \ sun sending its reflection far and wide. I moved to the door  to get a better\
  \ look, a rush of a cool cross breeze sent shivers down my spine thought the rays\
  \ made it gently warm. That was a sight that had to be experienced withe the combination\
  \ of sun sand and water baking this such a picturesque sight. the rays bouncing\
  \ off the water lit up the entire place. This in the backdrop of the countless flights\
  \ of birds out on their morning hunt for food brought bout a sense of satisfaction.A\
  \ feeling of being one with nature and being treated to this glorious sight was\
  \ the last thing i expected. the sight lasted only for about thirty seconds but\
  \ it was a feeling that gave me renewed excitement with the zeal to find more such\
  \ places and enjoying nature in its full glory.\n The city life gets hectic with\
  \ all its stress and limitations. A small experience sometimes gives us the fuel\
  \ to keep the engine of life moving. Those wonderful few seconds is what most people\
  \  crave but never get to live both due to time and resource constraints. On the\
  \ off chance one gets an opportunity to see new places and meet new people and exchange\
  \ cultures, we should take it up. Life gives us many such moments lest we squander\
  \ them."
