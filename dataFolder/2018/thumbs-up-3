Text: "As I trudged backwards into the gale along Ruta 9, I studied the mountainous\
  \ terrain surrounding me. Nothing but desolation lay ahead. Peering over my shoulder\
  \ at the caf\xE9 I left behind, a small burgundy speck appeared amongst the jagged\
  \ grey horizon. Buckling my elbow, I reached with my right arm into the road, fighting\
  \ the wind to maintain steadiness. With a deep inhale, I released all my apprehension\
  \ and lifted my thumb.\n\nOnly a few hours had passed since I sentenced myself to\
  \ solitary. Within that time, I watched dozens of tourists \u2013 cheeks beet red\
  \ from the unforgiving wind \u2013 flock in and out of the rustic cedar paneled\
  \ caf\xE9 they call El Ovejero (Spanish for \u201CThe Shepard\u201D). \n\nBy this\
  \ time I should\u2019ve been I wandering the petrified forest of El Calafate, Argentina.\
  \ But thanks to a careless oversight, I couldn\u2019t cross the Chilean border \u2013\
  \ my passport was missing. Ensconced in one of the wool-padded chairs that occupied\
  \ the caf\xE9, I stared at the dregs of coffee sitting at the bottom of my ceramic\
  \ mug. 11 hours remained until the tour bus would return. \n\n\u201CExcuse me. Can\
  \ I leave here without a vehicle or a tour?\u201D I asked the only staff member\
  \ I had seen since my arrival. \n\n\u201CHay que hacer dedo,\u201D he responded\
  \ as he hastily made his way back to the counter that was now lined with customers.\
  \ \n\nHitchhike. That word is what led me to Ruta 9 where I stood, staring beseechingly\
  \ at the burgundy sedan that drove past. The first of five vehicles I would watch\
  \ unconcernedly pass by me. \n\nSecond after my despair started to settle, a silver\
  \ pickup pulled 20 meters ahead of me. Staggering to the passenger side, I opened\
  \ the door. Hidden under dark caterpillar eyebrows, brown piercing eyes squinted\
  \ at me. \n\nThat\u2019s how I met Juan Carlos, a local rancher who spent his entire\
  \ life caring for the animals and fields of which I was journeying past. He accompanied\
  \ me all the way back to my hostel \u2013 a 30 minute drive past his farmhouse.\
  \ When I offered him payment, he refused it and demanded I use it on a warm lunch.\
  \ It\u2019s that sort of kindness that makes me love travel.\n\nWithout any details\
  \ on the voyage I abruptly decided to embark on that, I left El Ovejero with merely\
  \ a destination. If it wasn\u2019t for Juan\u2019s kindness that saved me from the\
  \ 12 hour walk I unknowingly had ahead of me, I\u2019m not sure how I would\u2019\
  ve made it. So maybe humanity isn\u2019t as horrible as everyone makes it out to\
  \ be. Either way, I will never set off on another isolated highway like that again\
  \ without a plan."
