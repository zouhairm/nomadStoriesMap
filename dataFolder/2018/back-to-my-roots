Text: "It was the perfect moment in my life to do something on my own. It was on the\
  \ first semester in college that I realized that I was denying the truth. I hated\
  \ taking the subway to go to class, I hated spending money that I didn't even have,\
  \ I hated knowing that I was stuck in college for four more years, at least. After\
  \ a wild night, two tequilas and a conversation with a stranger at 3 am in a sad\
  \ local pub, I knew I was missing something, and that I wasn't going to find in\
  \ Spain, my home for the past 12 years. \nI waited until I turned 18, December 7th.\
  \ \u02DDMama, I'm going to quit college, pack all my stuff and leave\". Sounds dramatic,\
  \ and it was, a single mom with an only child nightmare. I didn't think it was a\
  \ big deal, she knew for a long time that I've always wanted to go back where I\
  \ was born on my own. \nI was born in Nepal, my mom left me in an orphanage when\
  \ I was five years old and that was the luckiest and saddest day of my life. I've\
  \ always felt a strong and weird connection with Nepal, it's hard to explain, I\
  \ wouldn't call myself a Nepali, but I know there's a big part of who I am that\
  \ it was left behind in 2004 when I was adopted. \nIt was easy for me to say goodbye\
  \ to Spain. I live in a small city where everything that you do is probably going\
  \ to be in the local newspaper the day after. It's hard to take another path because\
  \ you know, what all my friends want to do is go to college, get a job, get married,\
  \ have kids, and hopefully die of old. \nFor me going to Nepal wasn't just a trip,\
  \ I wasn't just taking a plane because I wanted to do some type of boring gap year.\
  \ I was trying to find some answers. But, the fact is that I didn't even know the\
  \ questions. \nNepal is stunningly surprising, it's the most beautiful place on\
  \ earth I've ever seen, with all its contrasts between the city and the rural areas.\
  \ I'm also a romantic, and everything that's a bit different from what I'm used\
  \ to it's just the greatest. To me, every place is the greatest I've seen, because\
  \ I enjoy the present, and if I'm currently staring at the Himalayas, that's, without\
  \ doubt, the most spectacular view I could have. Places like people are unique and\
  \ precious. We need to take care of them. \nThis is not a \"Top 10 places to visit\
  \ in Nepal\" type of article, this is just me telling you that going to Nepal changed\
  \ me. It was scary, and I did regret it at some very hard moments, but life is there\
  \ to push you to your limits. Expect nothing and you'll have everything."
