Text: "\u201CIt is too far!! Isn\xB4t it?\u201D I can\xB4t even remember how many\
  \ times I heard that question back in Spain when I told everyone that I was going\
  \ to spend the next months there, in New Zealand, also known by Maori people as\
  \ Aotearoa (\u201Cthe land of the big White cloud\u201D). Twenty thousand kilometres\
  \ seem like a lot for most of the people, I get it, but I had already decided that\
  \ I was going there seeking for a big change in my life.\n\n\u201CDamn! It\xB4s\
  \ freezing\u201D\u2026that\xB4s all we could think about that morning, a winter\
  \ morning, not so far from the south pole. Spain was now very far, actually it was\
  \ the furthest place on earth. That morning it was New Zealand\xB4s cold who woke\
  \ us up. We woke up that morning in our campervan, surrounded by the big white mountains\
  \ of the west coast, nearby Lake Matheson. Getting ready is always a slow process\
  \ but it is worth to spend some extra time on it when you are visiting glaciers.\
  \ Every layer we could add was very welcome.\n\nWe were a really cosmopolitan group,\
  \ there were twelve of us coming from all over the world: Spain, France, USA, Mexico...\
  \ Everyone had his very own way to enjoy that moment. For me, it was keeping a conversation.\
  \ \n\nMy talking partner that morning was Trine, an American girl who was always\
  \ willing to go into the wild, way more experienced than me. \u201CHave you ever\
  \ been somewhere like this?\u201D she asked. My face should have been an answer\
  \ good enough for her to confirm that, certainly, that one was my first time. I\
  \ couldn\xB4t be more excited, winter in Spain is nothing like that, we can even\
  \ reach 15 celsius on new year\xB4s eve. The talk kept for the whole walk, it actually\
  \ helped a lot getting distracted from the cold, and even made the landscape more\
  \ beautiful as we walked through the valley.\n\nThe track was certainly demanding,\
  \ not suitable for people suffering vertigo. I have always declared myself as a\
  \ \u201Cbeach-person\u201D, the mountain is way harder, sometimes it gets so hard\
  \ that you cannot properly enjoy it\u2026 I used to think. Obviously, that statement\
  \ is absolutely invalid in such a place, even though I had to struggle all the way\
  \ through.\n\nThat day I felt in love for the mountains. The snowed mountains by\
  \ our sides, a tiny creek next to us and Franz Josef Glacier in front, stunning\
  \ even though the global warming has reduced significantly its size in the past\
  \ few years. Little cascades coming out from the peaks completed the picture, one\
  \ of the most beautiful ones I\xB4ve ever seen."
