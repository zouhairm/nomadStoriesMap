Text: "The exact day of my 30th birthday, I perfectly happened upon a festival at\
  \ the Sacr\xE9 Coeur Cathedral in Paris. Wine. Food. More Wine. A street band played\
  \ 'Happy Birthday' to me and the crowd joined in. I was in total bliss. Meandering\
  \ through the maze of winemakers and vendors, I caught the smile of a Frenchman\
  \ selling cheese: barrel chest, fiery eyes, 5 o'clock shadow at noon, noticeably\
  \ strong hands. I sampled his cheeses and butchered some French language exchange,\
  \ all the while 'cheesing' myself. Our chemistry made me nervous, so I made a comedic\
  \ exit. \nAfter another syrah-grenache, I knew I had to go back. I gathered myself\
  \ and returned to the cheese booth; he smiled even bigger. I wrote down my number\
  \ saying, \"Call me...for a French lesson.\"\nHe did call me and we met that night\
  \ at a corner bar with soft lighting, lots of windows, minimalist chairs and tables.\
  \ We were both anxious and giggly. I brought my French-English dictionary along\
  \ (my French is sub-par, and his English, sub-toddler). Though, it really didn't\
  \ matter. We understood. \nI was indecisive ordering a drink; I'd drank so much\
  \ already that day, but spotted a bitter orange liqueur I recognized. Confidently,\
  \ I sounded to the bartender, \"Bonsoir. Pour moi, je prends un 'suce' avec de la\
  \ glace,\" so proudly sure of myself. The sassy bartendress shot me a smirk of shock,\
  \ the patrons within earshot, also. Everyone rolled and through their laughter spat\
  \ out words too quick for me to translate. I glanced at my date, who was just as\
  \ stunned: face red, eyes wide.  I pointed, sounding out 'soose!'  \"Ah! Ah...soooze,\"\
  \ he corrected. I rolled my eyes, thinking myself another victim of French language-bullying,\
  \ which does happen. You mispronounce ONE little thing, and you're a mockery. So,\
  \ whatever...I got my Suze on ice and he, a beer. We chose an intimate spot on the\
  \ patio, street lights beaming off the table tops. Once we settled, I asked him\
  \ why they all laughed. What was my mistake? He took a sip of his beer in preparation\
  \ for the embarrassment and enlightened me: \"Eehh...In French...eehh, 'suce'...is\
  \ eehh...blowjob.\" \nHe didn't yet know this about me, but I can really take a\
  \ joke. I BURST into an awkward, ONGOING laughing fit. What I had so confidently\
  \ ordered translates into, \"Good evening. For me, I take a blowjob, with ice.\"\
  \  \nWhat follows is a story all its own: a beginning, a middle, an end. My very\
  \ own personal Parisian escort. It was the thing of films. It was l'amour. With\
  \ ice."
