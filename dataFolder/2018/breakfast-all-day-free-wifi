Text: "Was it the sign that said 'Breakfast [All day] ... Free Wifi!\" or was it the\
  \ clean and simple open look of the place? We weren't sure. But whatever it was,\
  \ we were glad that we gave it a go three days into our week long holiday on Phi\
  \ Phi Island. Because after that, we were there every single morning for breakfast!\
  \ \n   The portion sizes were generous. For what amounted to less than AUD10, we\
  \ had ourselves a hearty breakfast of beautifully done bacon, a slice of ham, perfectly\
  \ scrambled eggs, a pair of sausages, baked beans, lightly fried tomatoes, a few\
  \ slices of cucumbers, lettuce and two slices of bread, all beautifully presented\
  \ on a large white square platter with two little small butter packs. Oh, and tea\
  \ was served in dainty floral print cups with matching saucer that came with a little\
  \ jug of milk. It was simply perfect. \n   It was such an unexpected find on the\
  \ little 12.25 square kilometer irregularly shaped island paradise. The proprietor\
  \ served and attended to each guest personally. He had greeted us warmly, gently\
  \ and quite respectfully when we caught his eye, that first morning, to indicate\
  \ that we would be having breakfast that day at the Phi Phi Bakery. The little bakery-cafe\
  \ served Continental, American and Thai fare. It had sufficient space for just six\
  \ tables. Each table could seat four comfortably. \n   Over the next few days we\
  \ found out more about him. He worked the front area while his wife tended to things\
  \ in the kitchen. The place had been hit by the Boxing Day tsunami of 2004. It had\
  \ been opened 15 years earlier. We tried to visualise what it must have been like\
  \ for him to rebuild everything after such a devastation.\n   Harry told us about\
  \ the tsunami without a hint of bitterness or anger. He had accepted it and worked\
  \ hard to provide for himself and his family after that experience. He seemed content\
  \ with what he had achieved and where he was today. That was an attitude that seemed\
  \ to permeate the villagers. It had been a collective experience. They had most\
  \ likely mourned their losses together, regrouped and reconstructed their lives\
  \ as one village - an island village. It was as if they had matured and grown up\
  \ and been strengthened as a community because of their shared experience, their\
  \ shared losses. I didn't dare ask if they had lost anyone to it. \n   On our last\
  \ day, before we boarded the ferry that would take us to Phuket, where we would\
  \ catch our flight back to Singapore, we made it a point to call on Harry one last\
  \ time."
