Text: "After crossing the water laden red lateritic soil, green became visible. Crickets\
  \ chirped merrily, moist breeze caressed my sweaty body, a distant sound of forest\
  \ stream mixed with, chirpings and croakings were initially annoying to my ears,\
  \ later soothed me. In my first encounter with the wild part of Coorg forest, I\
  \ imagined meeting face to face with a Tiger, Gaur, or a Bear. What excited me more\
  \ was the mere thought of hiding behind branches of grandfather trees and visually\
  \ exploring the majestic beings of the forest. \nI walked enjoying the wilderness,\
  \ behind my guide Mr Poovu. From the dryness of village to the dampness of forest,\
  \ the transformation was gradual and beautiful; a light scent of day blooming champaka\
  \ mixed with the stench of wet soil made me high. The grandparent trees stood like\
  \ the protectors of the pathway on either side with mushroom pawns. I became aware\
  \ of myself and surroundings, as If my sensory organs were highly active. For the\
  \ first time, I could hear my breathing, crackling sound of leaves under my flip-flops,\
  \ and distant echoes of chirping. The trees were covered with ferns and moss as\
  \ seen in Jurassic Park, which are indicators of the pure air. I saw monkeys jumping\
  \ from tree to tree teasing us,  spotted birds dipped in the colours as if just\
  \ returned from Brazilian carnival, It was so magical, felt like I\u2019m the kid\
  \ from the \u201CThe jungle book\u201D of Mr Rudyard Kipling. However, I couldn\u2019\
  t spot any of the predators. \nThe green colour turned darker, giving a blackish\
  \ tint to the surroundings. After walking few miles I felt something in my feet.\
  \ I looked down, frightened by the gory look, started screaming. I pointed my fingers\
  \ towards my feet, the voice got trapped in my stomach, and came out as tears from\
  \ my eyes. I was jumping like a hopper, though an exaggeration, many yellow-brown\
  \ striped, small worm-like thing attached to my feet. The plight of a 20-year-old\
  \ human seeing these tiny monsters for the first time that too in own body; squishy,\
  \ slimy, cold creatures.\nGuide asked me to be calm and removed leech one by one\
  \ with bare hand by applying salt. For some time I barely touched my feet on the\
  \ ground in fear of Leeches. seeing this guide brushed tobacco generously onto feet,\
  \ and pacified me. This helped me believe no more leech-crawls. I resumed enjoying\
  \ the picturesque around. \nAnd for the first time trekkers in Coorg, I would say\
  \ no need to be afraid of the leeches, but be aware enough to expect it rather than\
  \ shaken by shock and terror."
