Text: "I was sitting in my hostel one morning after 6 days exploring the deep pan\
  \ pizza and musical magic that is Chicago, when I decided it was time for a change.\
  \ With a cheese and beer infused hangover I had no energy for another decision,\
  \ so I typed \u201CChicago\u201D into the origin field of a flight booking website,\
  \ left the destination field blank, and waited for destiny to decide on my next\
  \ adventure. \n\nThat night I found myself in Austin, Texas. From the moment I pulled\
  \ on the book revealing the secret cocktail bar in the Firehouse Hostel, I knew\
  \ my stay in the capital of \u201CKeeping it Weird\u201D was going to be special.\
  \ \n\nThe following morning I bumped in to Angus, the energetic Irishman, and we\
  \ spent the next few days exploring the streets of Austin. On a particularly hot\
  \ day we were wandering the streets in search of a cool drink when we stumbled across\
  \ the Waller Creek Pub and struck up a conversation with Houston, the red haired,\
  \ larger than life, Texan poet, turned barman. When Angus and I explained we were\
  \ after the real Texan experience, Houston suggested we come with him to his dad\u2019\
  s ranch in Richland Springs. We were beside ourselves with glee. Whilst Austin had\
  \ already been amazing, a night at a real life Texan Ranch would be something else!\n\
  \nAfter a night of drunken debauchery involving a boot scooting lesson, an underground\
  \ Texas saloon,  invisible skipping rope dancing, an epic Foosball battle, a lost\
  \ credit card, and an unexplained lump on the head, Angus, Houston and I jumped\
  \ into an old Cadillac and cruised past the cacti and tumbleweeds into the heart\
  \ of Texas.\n\nRichland Springs. Population, 330. Temperature, unbearable. We dropped\
  \ in to \u201CThe Feedlot\u201D the local dance hall, pub and pizzeria. Pushing\
  \ through the saloon doors we were met by the inquisitive stare of 3 real life cowboys,\
  \ one of whom, Stan, I took a particular shining to. After quizzing me about my\
  \ recent travels, I asked him how many times he had been out of Texas. With a tilt\
  \ of his hat, a twitch of his mustache, and a sparkle in his eye, Stan proclaimed:\
  \ \u201CI\u2019ve been out of Texas one time. It was one time too many.\u201D I\
  \ was in heaven.\n\nAs the sun began to set, Angus, Houston and I retreated to our\
  \ country cabin, cooked some steaks the size of small dogs on the grill, washed\
  \ them down with Texan whiskey and homemade pickles, and lied on our backs on the\
  \ cool grass with nothing but a guitar, our thoughts, and the infinite universe\
  \ sparkling in the sky above us."
