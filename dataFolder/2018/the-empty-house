Text: "I first saw it all black when my parents told me the news. I had always pictured\
  \ the fact as an impenetrable reality that was not going to happen. But things stopped\
  \ being words just to turn into facts and indeed, we were moving to Spain.  \nSo\
  \ suddenly, I was aware of my life in my little country: Uruguay. Aware of that\
  \ feeling of peace it gave me. It\xB4s like a warm and quiet, familiar sensation.\
  \ It\xB4s a dusk at the beach shore on a summer evening, when the R\xEDo de la Plata\
  \ blinked orange and pink colors while the sun got lost in the horizon submerging\
  \ in the calm water. It\xB4s a dinner with friends and family in the backyard. Or\
  \ like one of my parent\u2019s friends who certain day said, while he drank wine\
  \ and ate the homemade spicy sausage of the pork he had killed that same morning\
  \ \"If this is crisis, let it last a hundred years\". It is going to a little and\
  \ antique school where we were like a big family and knew each other since babies.\
  \ It is running when the bell of school rang just to get to the park in the center\
  \ of the city, where at the evening the medium fountain of toads which never worked\
  \ got filled with hungry pigeons and you could sit there for hours giving them food.\
  \ \nI was fourteen and my childhood had been innocent and happy in a very small\
  \ town. My house was a labyrinth of doors and hallways that interconnected one another.\
  \ I remember the flaming fireplace in the middle of the living room and the comfortable\
  \ black brown sofas that belonged to my grandfather. Rustic furniture which lacked\
  \ aesthetic coherence, tempered glass lamps hanging in the ceiling and the presence\
  \ of my little dog Estrella. She was always lying in the armrest of the sofa watching\
  \ people walking in the street. Only waiting for us to open the front door so she\
  \ could start running like crazy from one side to the other of the garden, deranged.\
  \ \nI remember the last evening I spent in that house. I was sitting in the floor\
  \ of the living room, feeling the tilde and the cold wall in my back. Fall loomed\
  \ and the sun heated with a very gentle light. The rooms were almost dark, illuminated\
  \ by the soft and sad light that comes after dusk. Empty rooms seemed dull, like\
  \ they had nothing to tell. All the warmness and comfort had disappear. Naked walls\
  \ and vacant cupboards. That same evening when we close the front door for the last\
  \ time, something inside of me closed too, and it was as empty as the house I was\
  \ leaving behind."
