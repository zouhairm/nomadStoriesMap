Text: "\"If you don't come to Boedo you cannot say you've visited Buenos Aires!\"\
  \ Ana said embracing me. \"If you say so, I believe it, even if you can never find\
  \ Boedo on a tourist guide\", I replied. \"In tourist guides, of course! Those are\
  \ books written to drain the rich European tourist wallet\". \"I'm not rich at all\"\
  , I replied. \"I was joking, you know. Nevertheless, Boedo is a unique neighborhood,\
  \ you\u2019ll see that. It doesn't have so many architectural or artistic goods,\
  \ but it's a neighborhood with a soul. Let's start: Boedo looks like a 50 thousand\
  \ people village in a city counting 3 million people. If you go to the neighborhood\
  \ of Palermo you have there rich people, here you've the working class. They've\
  \ statues, we've murales. They've shops, we've cafes. There discos, here tango clubs.\
  \ Do you see what I mean?\", she said smiling and continued: \"I believe that Boedo\
  \ is a synthesis of three things: culture, tango and San Lorenzo. You'll see in\
  \ the backstreets today\".\nShe was right. Boedo impressed me. It was dazzling.\
  \ It was well described by the word \u201Cpassion\u201D. In the past, it was the\
  \ cultural centre of the city thanks to a group of literates, philosophers, artist\
  \ and dreamers called \"The group of Boedo\". This neighbourhood was the embodiment\
  \ of the socialist incentive of the 1920's. Each caf\xE9 emanated a past made of\
  \ companionship, exchange of views, class fight, art, beauty and lightness.\nGoing\
  \ around, especially in the backstreets, I couldn't keep the count of people wearing\
  \ the San Lorenzo shirt, the historic team of the neighborhood. Every wall, every\
  \ portcullis, every space large enough was painted in blue and red, the team colours.\
  \ I stopped some guys while they were recording a song and asked one of them, Miguel,\
  \ how he felt about San Lorenzo. He said that \"La Gloriosa\" wasn't just a team,\
  \ it was the bond between sport and everyday life, between football and neighborhood.\
  \ Everything started with the passion for football and growing up, said Miguel,\
  \ started a process of overlapping between sport and culture. The club pervaded\
  \ the lives of those guys seven days a week. San Lorenzo was Boedo and Boedo was\
  \ San Lorenzo. \"Boedo es mi vida\" said poetically Miguel. The meaning of what\
  \ he tried to explain me a minute before was all there.\nWe said hello to those\
  \ guys and took the way back to the Esquina Homero Manzi, a tango club stepped in\
  \ history. Ana smiled to me, because she realized that little by little that neighbourhood\
  \ was giving its soul to me."
