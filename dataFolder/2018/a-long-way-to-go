Text: "The Kickapoo Valley Reserve stretches further than my eyes can capture from\
  \ the cliff. The Wildcat \u201CMountains\u201D cover a small portion of the Driftless\
  \ region on the far west side of Wisconsin\u2019s flat plains, unscathed by glaciers\
  \ thousands of years ago.  \n What am I doing?\n I quiver on the edge of a 100-foot\
  \ drop. Feet frozen on either side of a crack in the rock face. Legs are tightly\
  \ bent at the knee. My face flushes. \n  \u201CJules look at me,\u201D he says.\
  \ \u201CIt\u2019s okay.\u201D \n The sun rapidly approaches the skyline of trees.\
  \ The spring chill scrapes at my nose. Over 20 miles of hiking trails and 3,000\
  \ acres of white pines surround the canoed waters of the Kickapoo. \n Currently,\
  \ the only thing saving me from plunging to my death is a long rope and a thin white\
  \ pine tree.\n Steady. Feet apart. I let the rope ease out of my hands. \n Heat\
  \ drowns my face. Finally over the edge, my body\u2019s parallel to the ground,\
  \ high over the trees. My eyes plead up at him. The side of the cliff juts out to\
  \ create a ledge, but stops a shoe-width down. I will have to dangle.\n \u201CIt\u2019\
  s okay,\u201D he says again. \n No, it\u2019s not okay. I think, gripping the rope\
  \ with all my strength. I wish my little sister could be here. I could do this for\
  \ her. She is brave. I am reckless. When our parents died, she was brave.\n The\
  \ rope is coarse between my gloved hands, taunt and wedged in the crack my feet\
  \ once straddled. \n Slowly. The rope slides through my hand. Feet slip, body flings\
  \ forward\u2014rope burns! \n Stop. \n Why had I agreed to this? Because I had been\
  \ excited. Justin and I made preparations weeks ago. Walking up the cliff, the wind\
  \ wrapped around my face and the first morsels of summer silently wafted in the\
  \ wind. The rock surface full of scars, life, and beauty. Justin turned his bright\
  \ blue eyes to look at me saying, \u201CReady for an adventure, my love?\u201D I\
  \ had said yes. \n I pull the rope tight behind me. My body bounces, disrupting\
  \ the pure pine air. I wobble around to face the setting sun. Pink hues splatter\
  \ the wide horizon. The sky is smooth, the air wraps around my shoes like silk.\
  \ I sway. \n I realize the damn cliff I\u2019m repelling off is a lot like me. Scared,\
  \ eroded\u2014maybe a little peeked\u2014but still standing. Beautiful. Even a small\
  \ cliff and a thin tree in a far-away land called Wisconsin contain magic. \n Lungs\
  \ fill with snappy spring air as the sun sinks below the Wildcat Mountains. I scan\
  \ the tree-line before relying on the rope to take me down to solid ground."
