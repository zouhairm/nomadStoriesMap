Text: "Well, today was a conquer your fears kind of day.  I am deathly afraid of heights\
  \ but do so love to convince myself otherwise. So, off I went with cute striped\
  \ socks on to climb to the top of the Eiffel Tower. Finished in 1899, the tower\
  \ was supposed to be taken down after the World\u2019s Fair. Well, 116 years later,\
  \ it\u2019s still there and I was hoping to make it to the top. Climb probably isn\u2019\
  t the best word to use. There are 1710 steps to the top but I used 2 lifts because\
  \ it\u2019s much faster and a lot less scary. I will admit that I was freaking out\
  \ just a bit while waiting in line. I mean, who doesn\u2019t get scared knowing\
  \ you are going to be over 1,000 feet in the air?! The first lift wasn\u2019t so\
  \ bad. There are two levels to each section; one being a bit more enclosed than\
  \ the other. I gathered my nerve and looked around. Scary, yes. Gorgeous, YES! Most\
  \ people who are afraid of heights would have probably been satisfied with this\
  \ view and gone back down. Not me. I waited in line to go up to the Summit where\
  \ the lift was a lot smaller and my stomach and legs suddenly realized where we\
  \ were. What felt like 5 minutes later, I emerged from the lift very relieved to\
  \ see that the top is completely enclosed. You can get 360* view of Paris and you\
  \ don\u2019t feel like you are about to fall off the edge. Just as I was beginning\
  \ to feel better, I saw another set of stairs leading up. I had to see where they\
  \ went so I slowly walked up and lo and behold, there is yet another viewing platform.\
  \ This one is very open, very windy, but up there, you can see for 40 miles! I shuffled\
  \ my way over to the edge, had my picture taken, walked around the entire platform,\
  \ and left for the lift feeling very proud of myself. Not only did I visit the Eiffel\
  \ Tower, but I conquered my fear yet again to make it all the way to the top. Heights\
  \ has nothing on me..(well, until next time I want to climb something tall)! After\
  \ the tower, I had potato and leeks soup in a cafe on Rue Clere street. It\u2019\
  s one of the coolest pedestrian market streets in Paris and has any kind of store\
  \ you can think of.Then, I made my way back to the Seine to take a nighttime boat\
  \ cruise for about an hour. I finished the night being able to watch the tower perform\
  \ its light show on the top of every hour. What a dazzling display of brilliance!\
  \ I was so glad I was able to experience the tower from many different heights today.\
  \ Paris is lovely and I cannot wait to see what else it has to offer."
