Text: "\u201DI just booked a flight for us, it leaves in three hours. I\u2019ll see\
  \ you at the airport\u201D my best friend Sarah tells me. I close my opened mouth.\
  \ \u201DAre you serious? I\u2019m broke!\u201D I respond with a mixture of excitement\
  \ and fear. She continues unbothered: \u201DWe can crash at Ludvig\u2019s, it\u2019\
  s the sailing week over there and I want to meet some sailors\u201D. I laugh and\
  \ answer \u201DSee you soon\u201D, while I quickly grab an extra pair of undies\
  \ and a toothbrush to go.\n\nOur flight lands at 9pm and Sarah\u2019s friend Ludvig\
  \ still hasn\u2019t responded to her several calls and messages telling him we\u2019\
  re coming. \u201DWhat do we do?\u201D I ask. \u201DWe download Tinder\u201D Sarah\
  \ says. We get in contact with a group of guys that takes us out clubbing. We dance\
  \ and get a lot of free drinks until they want to take us home. Feeling reluctant\
  \ I call an old flame named Ben instead, who happens to live here. \u201DOf course\
  \ you\u2019ll stay with me!\u201D he answers and immidiately comes to pick us up,\
  \ in front of the dissappointed Tinder-guys.\n\nThe following day Ben drives us\
  \ to the bus that would take us to the event of the sailing week. \u201DCall me\
  \ before you use tinder for a place to stay again!\u201D he says. We nodd and thank\
  \ him with absolutely no clue how we would solve the following night. But as soon\
  \ as we step out of the bus we see Sarahs friend Ludvig. \u201DOmg, hi! What are\
  \ you doing here!?\u201D he says, shocked but thrilled to see us. Turns out he had\
  \ dropped his phone in the ocean. He introduces us to all his sailor friends and\
  \ we watch the final competition from the VIP-section, overlooking the entire gulf.\
  \ Actually, only competitors were allowed up there, but Sarah and I had a newfound\
  \ confidence making it very hard to question us. \n\nUsing the same confidence we\
  \ also get in to the big closing party. However, I did feel a little less confident\
  \ the following morning when I was cleaning one of the boats from my own puke, with\
  \ Sarah and my new sailor friends supervising me from the dock. As I lean over the\
  \ boat to rinse of the cloth in the water I feel my dress getting caught in the\
  \ wind, exposing my entire behind. I pull down my dress and slowly turn to my audience\
  \ with a big smile: \u201DI\u2019ve hit rock bottom\u201D. They couldn\u2019t stop\
  \ laughing. \u201DNow you\u2019ve had the entire sailor week-experience\u201D one\
  \ of them winks at me.\n\nSarah and I try to book tickets home, but our credit cards\
  \ get declined. \u201DOh, you can pay with an invoice!\u201D I discover. \u201D\
  Perfect\u201D.  When we finally get home my mom asks me how the weekend went. \u201D\
  Smooth sailing\u201D I answer, smiling."
