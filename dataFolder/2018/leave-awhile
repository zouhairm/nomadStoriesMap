Text: "\u201CSo are you from \u2018round here, or just visiting?\u201D A kind voice\
  \ asked me. Finally someone broke the silence in this lonely gift shop.\n\u201C\
  I wish I was from here. I\u2019m from a small town in southwest Colorado,\u201D\
  \ I replied, picking through a pile of Arizona-native crystals.\nThe woman behind\
  \ the voice took a pause before inquiring distastefully, \u201CWhy are you even\
  \ in Sedona right now?\u201D Her voice no longer felt kind and inviting. \nStartled,\
  \ I turned to face her. Why so bitter? I was experiencing Sedona, Arizona, for the\
  \ first time and it fulfilled every fantasy I had manufactured in my head for months\
  \ prior. Even just images of the town behind a screen captivated me, and I came\
  \ with the intent to prowl every corner this red desert had to offer; even this\
  \ dismal gift shop on the edge of town. Sedona was a place I traveled to only in\
  \ my dreams until now, and to hear a local express such disdain for this heaven\
  \ on earth caused my face to flush with envy. She doesn\u2019t know what she has!\
  \ I scrambled for a response.\n\u201CI\u2019ve lived in Colorado my whole life,\u201D\
  \ I calmly began. \u201CI was drawn to Sedona because it looked like a home to me.\u201D\
  \n\u201CYou don\u2019t know what you have, surrounded by the Rocky Mountains,\u201D\
  \ she shot back, as if she had read my mind on what I thought about her.\nWhat a\
  \ jaded thing to say! I spent what little money I had to get the need for Sedona\
  \ out of my system, and was greeted by someone who wanted to escape it. I would\
  \ give anything to trade places with this woman; I\u2019d even work in this desolate\
  \ gift shop 40 hours per week if that meant just retiring to my own desert home\
  \ every night. This trip meant so much to me; it was my first trip outside of my\
  \ Colorado hometown.\nThese thoughts buzzed through my mind for a short while before\
  \ realizing I was leering into the eyes of a woman who I now see so much of myself\
  \ in. Behind her hostility lay a wanderlusting soul that faced difficulty in escaping\
  \ a dusty routine, much like myself. I drew in a deep breath, carefully crafting\
  \ my next words to the woman impatiently awaiting my rebuttal. \n\u201CI know how\
  \ you feel.\u201D\nI was met with silence.\n\u201CI do live in a beautiful place,\u201D\
  \ I continued. \u201CYou do too. It took a lot out of me to get here. You need a\
  \ break from Sedona, like I did Colorado.\u201D\nHer tense shoulders dropped and\
  \ her tight expression turned to a smile of guilt and apology.\n\u201CI\u2019m sorry,\
  \ lady,\u201D she croaked. \u201CLet me show you one of my favorite hikes \u2018\
  round here. Haven\u2019t done it myself in years, but it\u2019s one of Sedona\u2019\
  s treasures.\u201D"
