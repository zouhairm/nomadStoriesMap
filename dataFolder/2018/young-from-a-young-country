Text: "You meet them at the airport. They\u2019re on the same flight. You speak of\
  \ sites to see together while someone scans your boarding pass. You spend the flight\
  \ looking out the window, planning a trip with newfound friends as the North Atlantic\
  \ passes beneath you.\n\nA lonely tube ride to Waterloo station. The French countryside.\
  \ Rolling hills. You talk to the young woman sitting in front of you on the train.\
  \ She\u2019s going to Paris too.\n\nHours into the evening she leaves with a Frenchman.\
  \ You can\u2019t blame her, you keep telling yourself. You pay your tab at bar close\
  \ and wander the streets wearing a backpack, looking for a park to crash.\n\nFamiliar\
  \ sounds of English echo from a group ahead. You approach your fellow countryfolk.\
  \ You\u2019re transported home. You\u2019re a needless obstacle or possible threat.\
  \ Go find your park.\n\nYou didn\u2019t come here to be home, you tell yourself.\
  \ The night gets cooler.\n\nA car pulls up. \u201CSurely you must stay with us!\u201D\
  \ Says a young man with a French accent.\n\nThe smell of old cigarette smoke seeps\
  \ out of hallway walls and carpet. A nonsmoker\u2019s nightmare. Better than a park,\
  \ you keep telling yourself.\nYou hear a lively party down the hall. It\u2019s his\
  \ room. Dozens of Parisians dressed in black and white drift through cacophonous\
  \ cigaretten haze.\n\nYou see her in the dim light. She gives you a cigarette. You\u2019\
  re a smoker now. You talk and puff until your lungs hurt.\n\nThe young man cooks\
  \ you both eggs in the morning. You find out he\u2019s her brother. And she says,\
  \ \u201CCome with us to south of France, our hometown festival.\u201D\n\nWarm summer\
  \ breeze blows across the balcony you\u2019re leaning over. Whistles and drums accompany\
  \ a giant blow-up jester that looks too much like a king. You laugh when her brother\
  \ does a dance and yells at the passing parade. \n\nBut the whole scene is quiet\
  \ drab compared to the empty streets she\u2019ll show you later. You can\u2019t\
  \ remember how long you stayed, or why you ever left.\n\nYou think of all this while\
  \ rocketing towards Paris on the same train you took the first time you visited.\
  \ You smile when you realize she\u2019ll have a pack of cigarettes waiting."
