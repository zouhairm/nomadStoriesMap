Text: "\"Rain is coming. The ship'll start rocking soon, so hold on to your kids!\"\
  \ A man with a white kufi on his head breathed heavily as thunder boomed loudly\
  \ over our ship. With each lighting strike, palm trees shook aggressively as we\
  \ sailed closer to the beach. The winds attacked the ship from every direction as\
  \ people huddled together on the deck. \n\nThe man walked over, emptied a crate\
  \ of fish onto a corner of the deck, and sat down on it beside me. \"You look terrified\
  \ son.\" He reached inside a paper bag and handed me a samosa. \"Uncle Pintu. Call\
  \ me Uncle Pintu. It's monsoon season right now so the Bengal waves get rough, but\
  \ don't worry. We fishermen are friends with the waves.\"\n\nI took the samosa and\
  \ gulped it down. I came to explore St. Martin's island off the shore of Chittagong,\
  \ one of Bangladesh's most beautiful nature reserves. My grandma told me the island\
  \ would soon be taken by the Burmese or the Indians; I didn't believe it, but I\
  \ didn't want to risk it. I was impatient and desperately wanted to see the island\
  \ for its beauty.  \n\n\"Isn't it risky for ships to sail during storms? The rains\
  \ are really harsh.\" Uncle Pintu chuckled. He looked up at the sky and smiled.\
  \ \"Monsoon rains are nothing but beautiful. They never hurt us. They play. We just\
  \ need to listen to them calling for us and we'll know exactly when and how they'll\
  \ come alive.\"\n\nI was intrigued. Here sat a man amidst a forthcoming storm, yet\
  \ all he did was relish in the \"beauty\" of everything that was happening around\
  \ us. The wet humidity rushing down our skins, the taste of salt in the air, the\
  \ ever-clashing roars of waves colliding underneath us. He spoke of every detail\
  \ of nature as if it lived and breathed. All I had done so far was complain about\
  \ the weather.\n\n\"People come here for the coral reefs and palm trees but forget\
  \ to look at everything else. There's so much detail people overlook. We fishermen\
  \ survive because we can sense the slightest changes in weather. Our minds are clear\
  \ so we could fully use all our senses.\"\n\nI contemplated this. Travel wasn't\
  \ simply movement. It was touch, taste, sight; authentic travel stemmed from us\
  \ sensing the minute details in the world around us. Not stories from our grandmothers\
  \ or roads on a map. We tend to miss whole experiences as we solely focus on arriving\
  \ to our destination rather than appreciating the small moments that lead to it.\
  \ Uncle Pintu believed authentic travel lies in the details we forget to sense,\
  \ and now, so did I."
