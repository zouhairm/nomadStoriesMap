Text: "\"Why do you look like a scared cat?\"\n\n\"Because I have never had this experience\"\
  , I said\n\n\"Don't worry, we are normal, you don't need to be scare\"\n\nIt was\
  \ the chilled night of January when I had to go to Punjab from the posh lights of\
  \ New Delhi streets. The fault in my stars enforced me to miss the last luxurious\
  \ train, leaving me with an option of traveling in a local train. These trains have\
  \ the capacity to give spaces to a large crowd by offering tight places on floors\
  \ too.\n\nI was not planned for so many cheap thrills which that night brought along\
  \ with its darkness. Being the only girl in the coach stuffed with men made me vulnerable\
  \ to any kind of challenges. \n\nMy heartbeats were getting faster with every tick\
  \ of the clock, but I didn't lose my calm. Suddenly, there came a group of transgenders,\
  \ who realized my pain and offered me a seat on the floor. I was scared like hell.\
  \ They started talking to me. After making me comfortable, they shared their food\
  \ with me, and I accepted it with a big heart. The conversation we had after the\
  \ food was dipped in some different colors.\n\n\"So what do you guys do for your\
  \ expenses?\" I asked \n\n\"Since we are not allowed to work as normal people, we\
  \ find tricks for our expenses. Apart from convincing people to give us money, we\
  \ have our group which fights against sexism.\"\n\n\"Oh! Sexism, that means you\
  \ guys are feminists? That is great because women of this world have suffered a\
  \ lot and we all deserve equal rights.\" I said\n\n\"You are wrong here my child.\
  \ Fighting against sexism and supporting feminism are two different things. While\
  \ feminism demand powers, taking a stand against sexism is an initiation to remove\
  \ a trash from the society. We agree that women have suffered a lot but what about\
  \ transgenders? Feminism provides you equal rights and power irrespective of gender,\
  \ is it really what people of this generation think? They demand things in the name\
  \ of feminism, which already shows sexism in the term. Why can't we make things\
  \ normal for every person on this planet?\"\n\nMy eyes were wide open, gut was full\
  \ of pain, and heart was melting to these statements. Those words completely changed\
  \ my views regarding feminism and yes, we will see a new world if we make things\
  \ simple by just raising our voices against sexism. \n\nA goodbye with a hug was\
  \ the last thing I expected from this journey."
