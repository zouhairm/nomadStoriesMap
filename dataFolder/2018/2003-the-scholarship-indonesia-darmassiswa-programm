Text: "A decision that pushed me to the edge.\nBefore you continue to read one of\
  \ my stories, I Ask you to take sincerity of all essence into account and not especially\
  \ to pay attention to spelling errors. \n\"From one extreme to the other\" - it\
  \ the well-known expression has not a small role in mankind life. For the decision\
  \ which is made by the person, he answers. Unfortunately, not always we receive\
  \ the expected result. Edges have different corners proceeding from what, and it\
  \ was necessary to be content with the corresponding award.\nYear 2003, I am 18\
  \ years old, study in Indonesia... Up to 16 years, I didn't speak Russian as I studied\
  \ in the Kyrgyz class. I always sympathized with society and I lacked attention\
  \ of the environment. And here my next edge: I go to register in dances in the Break\
  \ dance direction. I was very lucky with heads and collective who have given me\
  \ forces, have lifted spirit and have inspired on new heights. And in half a year\
  \ I not only have learned dance bases, but also have created the dancing group,\
  \ and half a year later at me the dancing studio from 9 groups (50 people).\nIn\
  \ 17 years (2002) my father has suggested me to fill out the bid on annual training\
  \ in Indonesia (exchange of experience among students) according to the presidential\
  \ program \"The Cadres of XXI Century\". In 7 months I was called by White house\
  \ and also in August, 2003, I have already arrived to Indonesia (Bandung). As it\
  \ has appeared, I was the only among the CIS countries. This step, for me became\
  \ an entrance to adulthood. Besides, among all participants, I was one of the youngest,\
  \ with my age there were only 3 of 118 participants. \nNow, I am 32 years old. There\
  \ were defeats, victories, good luck, misfortunes, love and disappointment. If not\
  \ my beloved mother, hardly I would live about the years. Therefore I don't despair\
  \ and I wait for new fulfillments.\nThis story has no analogs as bears in itself\
  \ the real truth and on the other side of \"Each person is individual\".\nDuring\
  \ the volunteer activity I had experience to meet such vulnerable society as: homeless\
  \ children, single mothers, persons inclined to alcoholism and other unbalanced\
  \ people with mental tendencies. Proceeding from situations, I was more and more\
  \ approved in the mission \"The help, that who is weak and has weakened\".\nTo find\
  \ myself - here what I was engaged the last 7 years. Having sufficient experience\
  \ for the years, I can add: I am very sorry, I Love, Forgive, and I Thank - LIFE!"
