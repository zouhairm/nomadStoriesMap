Text: "I am a misfit. \nI didn`t entirely fit. I longed to be in touch with my own\
  \ insignificance.\nI set foot in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico.\nMy attention was drawn\
  \ by the peculiar; the nameless. I was searching for the unique, the unexpected\
  \ and the untold.\nEnter a place, find the right bell, ring it and praise the unknowing\
  \ of whom you are visiting. A kind moustached Mexican and a Bridge Club.\nHitchhiking;\
  \ a place to be found but not sought after. \nCaba\xF1as made out of palm trees\
  \ residing on the seemingly endless width of sandy ground overlooking the watery\
  \ depths of the infinite ocean surrounded by cacti in the size of trees and mountains\
  \ so red and bald you wouldn`t think allow any form of living beings. That was when\
  \ I found myself food and waterless, delicate 19 years old and not at all ready\
  \ to cease to be and enter a fossil existance. \n`El Pescadoro` was my white flag\
  \ in the deep red soil. \nOnly a 30 minute walk. Walk straight until you meet the\
  \ highway, make a left turn and head up straight again until you reach town. You\
  \ can`t miss it. \nThose were the words of my only neighbor in my caba\xF1a neighborhood\
  \ and the last as she was leaving the day I arrived. \nFor sale pieces of land,\
  \ unfinished deserted houses, and endless stretches of dry nature taking its course\
  \ and taking back what once belonged to its inhabitors. \nEventually cars would\
  \ pass by and send their well-wishes; a smile fed by confusion and naked spite.\
  \ I was picked up by an elderly couple from the States. \nThey thought I was nuts.\
  \ \nHis wife wouldn`t spare me her sense of disapproval for my being. \nNothing\
  \ could stop me; swept up in the euphoria of discovery. Merriment and naivit\xE9\
  \ were my sword and shield. My female self empowered both protection and vulnerabilty.\
  \ \nI was released at the fruit stand, we made our farewells and I directed my exclusive\
  \ attention back towards my mission to find edibles. \nMission accomplished through\
  \ the rescuing power of the sombrero man. \nVastness unrevealed, people clueless\
  \ in the unknowing. I was one of them; isolated by the comfort of our bubble in\
  \ the Western World.\nMy eyes sighted a handful fairly improvised wracked houses\
  \ lined up on both sides of the highway and a gas station. An European funny looking\
  \ girl carrying a ridiculous amount of green ripping plastic bags filled to its\
  \ maximum with produce and a bathtub amount of water as if preparing for the ultimate\
  \ apocalypse must have been as peculiar looking and thus after all a fit for the\
  \ town she found herself in."
