Text: "I was in search of healers. Anyone who might cure my father\u2019s cancer.\
  \ It was in a tea stall in Mehendipur where I heard of the Baba who heals.\nEarly\
  \ next morning, I was on my way. Five hours in a rattling bus, through dry treeless\
  \ landscape. A half hour\u2019s ride in a jeep, through a dusty village. And as\
  \ night fell, a twenty- minute trudge up a forested hill. \nIn the dark hilltop,\
  \ a man glared at me suspiciously with black-kohled eyes. He led me reluctantly\
  \ into an open courtyard. There, under a sky twinkling with stars, sat a frail old\
  \ man on a charpoy, dragging deeply on a chillum. Around him, sat five or six men.\
  \ The air was heavy with the scent of marijuana. I felt afraid. \n\u201CDon\u2019\
  t be afraid,\u201D said the Baba. \u201CNothing bad happens here.\u201D I spent\
  \ the night in fitful sleep, in a room that seemed to be their storehouse.\nI awoke\
  \ at dawn. And stepped out. All around me was a forest cloaked in the tenderest\
  \ of greens. Red gulmohars and white magnolias adorned the ashram garden. In the\
  \ courtyard, sat the old baba, alone, hunched before the sacred fire, waiting. And\
  \ then\u2026 a rustle in the trees, a clattering on the tin roof of the little temple\
  \ dedicated to the Monkey God. And suddenly, bounding in from the forest below,\
  \ were dozens of long tailed monkeys. The baba graciously handed out bunches of\
  \ bananas for those in whom he saw his God.  \nAs morning drew on, the villagers\
  \ trickled in, with their little problems. A peepal tree was growing into a village\
  \ house. Should they cut it? \u201CThe Baba made the villagers plant trees. And\
  \ now, you see, there\u2019s a whole forest!\u201D remarked one of the villagers.\
  \ Ashok told me that since the Baba came to their village, nobody fell ill. \u201C\
  How old is he?\u201D I asked. \u201CNobody knows,\u201D was the reply. \u201CMy\
  \ father saw him as old as he is now.\u201D \nLater that afternoon, I sat with the\
  \ baba, telling him of my father\u2019s illness, of my fear of being left alone\
  \ in the world. He listened kindly. Then, reaching out for the peacock feathers,\
  \ he brushed me lightly from head to toe, muttering an incantation. \u201CWhy be\
  \ sorrowful about death? It is only the ones who stay behind who are sad. For the\
  \ one who goes, it is a journey of everlasting joy!\u201D he said. He gave me some\
  \ sacred ash for my father.  \nAs the sun turned crimson, I bade goodbye.\nMy father\
  \ died soon after. Perhaps Sitaram Baba is dead too. But sometimes, on starlit nights,\
  \ they come alive, as I tell my tales of that wondrous land I had stumbled upon,\
  \ in my wanderings through the darkness of despair."
