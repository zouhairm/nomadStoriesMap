Text: "A wholesome meal of omelette and toast later, we marched out towards the main\
  \ city. The night before was spent in a \u201Ctent\u201D, next to the high mountains\
  \ of Kasol, close to nature, \u201Caway from the city\u201D I said, while plugging\
  \ in my phone to the charging point inside the tent, under the tube light, laying\
  \ on my cozy spring bed. \nWe chose to walk back to Kasol. Skipping the bus meant\
  \ walking through the hilly back of the Parvati Mountains, along the field, vegetation,\
  \ small water streams and the Parvati River itself. It was pleasant. Every now and\
  \ then we would bump into locals busy with their work and tourists carrying their\
  \ radio and OCB. Walking and memorizing the names of those smaller villages amid\
  \ those trees, rocks and a bridge, closer to our destination. We don\u2019t want\
  \ this to end so soon. We begin on to go higher to Rasol. The real issue is when\
  \ you are out of hard cash, and the place that you are headed to have just about\
  \ 75 houses, none of which was an atm. This meant even if we started out the trek\
  \ and reached there, we would have to come back to our rooms down at the city before\
  \ dark. We embark anyway.\nInitially we could see fellow trekkers, stopping for\
  \ a break to bite onto that snickers. Sometime we would pass them over, and then\
  \ when we stop to catch our breaths, we would see them pass us. This went on for\
  \ a while. It was like an unsaid companionship. For that trek we were partners.\
  \ Running low on cash (to buy any snickers) and time, we decided to move it quickly.\
  \ We didn\u2019t stop for a long time. These rocks with RASOL painted on them kept\
  \ showing up.Now we were getting away from the village. For a long stretch you would\
  \ not see a single human being but the mountains and its depth. Those little stops\
  \ did not end with another group passing us through anymore. Long after we start\
  \ to see ourselves getting closer to these isolated small shops, which we suppose\
  \ were stops for trekkers at some point. \u201CTea Point and Snacks\u201D, I could\
  \ read on the fallen banner. This place was definitely abandoned. Similar go downs,\
  \ small house Porsche with a chair in front, black marks from something being lit.\n\
  Now, we are running out of daylight and water, and the only sign of humans were\
  \ these abandoned shops. Those warm yellow signs have turned blue by now. Why would\
  \ we believe these random signs, I curse myself. We have to decide now! Go up or\
  \ back? I took one last look at the blue face painted next to the sign, before a\
  \ tear rolled down out of fear for my life."
