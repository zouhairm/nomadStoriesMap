Text: "It all started with me noticing a framed picture of a yellowish single-storied\
  \ house seemingly made of mud, in a small coffee shop here in Chicago. Sensing my\
  \ interest in the photo, the owner told me it belonged to her family in New Mexico;\
  \ it is called adobe house, and is in fact made out of earth, giving it a unique\
  \ appearance. Learning that I was new in the country, she insisted that I visit\
  \ the village of Taos in New Mexico during Christmas; it would be a memorable experience.\
  \ So off I went on a solo-trip to Taos.\n\nOn Christmas eve, I drove from Santa\
  \ Fe to Taos Pueblo (pueblo - native American word for village), and saw the most\
  \ interesting thing along the way. The highway was lined n both sides with glowing\
  \ little paper bags, giving it a mystic appearance. When I reached Taos Pueblo and\
  \ asked a local about this; he said those are farolitos, or paper lanterns. The\
  \ natives make them just for Christmas, and decorate streets on Christmas eve; this\
  \ tradition has been maintained for centuries. \u201CWe call them bag-alitos\u201D\
  \ he quipped!\n\nOn entering the pueblo, I was welcomed with locally made hot-fried\
  \ bread, served with cinnamon sugar. The village consists of barely a hundred adobes\
  \ surrounding an open ground they call the plaza, a church and a cemetery. As I\
  \ walked around, I noticed multistoried adobes for the first time; the storeys connected\
  \ on the outside by wooden ladder cases. On the ground, the villagers were building\
  \ four around 20-feet long bonfires. On asking a resident about this, I learnt that\
  \ the village has no electricity; this was going to be their Christmas light! Soon\
  \ after started the celebrations. Following a prayer in the church, statues of mother\
  \ Mary and Jesus (Emmanuel) were carried around the plaza on the shoulders of the\
  \ villagers, with a group singing their native prayer songs and another group decked\
  \ up in traditional clothing doing a \u201Cdeer dance\u201D to those songs. I was\
  \ watching this rather interesting performance, when suddenly, I was almost deafened\
  \ by a series of gunfires. This is part of their Christmas celebrations too, to\
  \ alert the villagers that mother Mary is approaching. As the huge bonfires were\
  \ lit after dark, the small plaza turned into some sort of an enchanted land! I\
  \ spent the rest of the evening there, witnessing in awe, the most unique Christmas\
  \ so far.\n\nAs I reached the airport the next day for my flight back, I read a\
  \ sign which I had missed when I arrived, \u201CWelcome to the Land of Enchantment\u201D\
  . Apt name, I thought."
