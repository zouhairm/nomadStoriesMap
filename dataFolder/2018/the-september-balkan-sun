Text: "The September Balkan sun \u2013 hot and stuffy. I was lost. Where should I\
  \ go? Yet I smiled.\n\nMany had advised me against visiting Serbia due to old tales\
  \ and stereotypes. I went anyway, and regretted the burden of negativity. The visual\
  \ impact proved depressing. Some buildings were covered with bullet holes. Children\
  \ in rugged clothes begging for my shoes instead of money. \nI felt trapped. I needed\
  \ to leave.\n\nWith a map in hand, I planned to hitch a 210km-ride from Nis, Serbia\
  \ to Skopje, Republic of Macedonia. After a train to a village called Doljevac,\
  \ I strutted across a vast cropland and upon reaching the highway, holding up signs\
  \ for hitchhiking. \n\nSoon, the big red truck stopped by. Feeling timid, after\
  \ wiggling my way up the truck, I peeked at the driver \u2013 a man in his 40s,\
  \ with a moustache, like a Serb Charlie Chaplin. He name is Miloje. From his tummy\
  \ I reckoned he takes Rakije daily, although he soon admitted his love for Cevapi\
  \ and Burek. He was evidently curious about me. As a country that only recently\
  \ opened their borders to foreigners for visa-free visit, it was uncommon to see\
  \ Asian travellers, what more riding with one. \n\nLike many travellers, other than\
  \ food names, I don't speak Serbian and nor did Miloje English. That made us comfortable\
  \ as our communication revolved around food via eye contact and hand gestures. We\
  \ bonded. He focused on his wheels, while I admired the mountainous scenery as the\
  \ Serbs work on their farms. \n\nMiloje broke the silence. It must have been on\
  \ his mind for a while, as he forcefully uttered all the limited English words he\
  \ knew, \"Serbia, good. We no wars, no guns. Only want friends. Friends. \" \n\n\
  Friends. \n\nI was at loss of words. I was compelled to leave Serbia due to the\
  \ overwhelming scenarios. Yet here Miloje was, expressing in all sincerity that\
  \ today, Serbians want only love and peace. I felt ashamed, for judging Serbians\
  \ and their nation and running away.  \n\nThe heartfelt moment deepened our connection.\
  \ As Miloje slowly opened up about his family, to express my gratitude, I took out\
  \ a paper and began sketching him. Holding tightly onto them drawings, like a big\
  \ baby, he cried with all his heart out. \n\nIt was a 70km journey. Miloje dropped\
  \ me by a suburb called Vranje. After he left, I sighed, recovering from the emotional\
  \ departure. The September Balkan sun imprinted a new tan on my skin, the memories\
  \ in my mind and hopefully, peace in our world. As for now, let\u2019s keep going!"
