Text: "My nerves were heating up as I boarded the small white plane for take off,\
  \ my instructor had explained all the instructions and told me about the million\
  \ skydives he had done but unfortunately that did not stop my heart from beating\
  \ outside of my chest. \nMoving unsteadily to the door, the strength of the wind\
  \ hit me in the face before one,two,three...I was free falling.\nThen the thirst\
  \ of adrenaline hit me, this is what skydiving was all about. I felt like a feather\
  \ falling weightlessly through the clouds. my goggles were tightly pushed against\
  \ my face from the wind pressure and I could feel myself constantly licking my lips\
  \ to stop them drying out. \nBefore I know it the parachute sprung free and my body\
  \ jerked back into my instructor. I felt like a bird gliding through the air. Looking\
  \ down 8,000 feet about sea level, the view was incredible, I had never seen the\
  \ sea look so blue and the mountains in the background look beautiful, skydiving\
  \ was truly the best way to see real nature. I felt like the FBI, looking down at\
  \ all the small cars and people getting on with their everyday life. \nAfter 10\
  \ minutes of soaring through the sky my feet finally slid along the white sand and\
  \ the parachute fell around us. I thanked my instructor and realise how lucky he\
  \ was to take in those views everyday."
