Text: "As the bus pulled up at the Beijing Zhenhua Tourism School, I didn\u2019t know\
  \ what to expect. I remember the cloudy sky and the foggy air; it was early March\
  \ but felt like winter was at its peak. The snow from the night before, which had\
  \ my friends and I sneak past curfew to experience (to most of us) our first snow,\
  \ had melted but left the exciting chilliness in the air.\n\nThere was a bunch of\
  \ students in white jackets and black pants, waiting for us outside the building.\
  \ They all wore an eager smile accessorized by anticipation. Near them was what\
  \ resembled a white inflatable like panda costumed person, who was waving enthusiastically\
  \ at us.\n\nWe immediately got swarmed by them, descending from the bus, there was\
  \ probably triple the amount of us. They were so awestruck by us, it was like they\
  \ were seeing their favorite celebrities. There was so much inspiration in their\
  \ eyes, that just screamed to befriend us. \n  \nAfter the initial meet and greet,\
  \ the students guided us in, as we all made our way in, each \u201Cforeigner\u201D\
  \ sat with at least one Chinese friend. I somehow found myself a small fan club,\
  \ that consisted of two girls. They had this warm genuine smile and long bangs that\
  \ almost covered their eyes. Really gentle and kind souls who were so appreciative\
  \ of our presence. The details of our conversations are vague, but I don\u2019t\
  \ forget their faces nor them asking for my name and then giggling at how Jennifer\
  \ sounded, they were also so pleased to share with me both their Chinese name and\
  \ their American names. More giggles erupted as I tried pronouncing their birth\
  \ names. \n\nThe cultural bonding was then interrupted by a speaker informing us\
  \ about the performance from the Zhenhua students, in dedication of our arrival.\
  \ We were also interrupted by my French teacher telling me to come up with a song\
  \ for my group to perform for them as a thank you. \nMany of the students did group\
  \ pieces, like dancing to popular American or Chinese songs, until one cute Chinese\
  \ guy started to sing towards me, eventually inviting me to stand next to him as\
  \ he serenaded me. My first and last serenade was made by a Chinese Justin Bieber\
  \ who melted my heart 5 years ago exactly next week. \n\nOf course, seeing the Forbidden\
  \ City, the Great Wall, and the Shanghai Financial Trade center were remarkable\
  \ experiences, but the friendliness I experienced from every Chinese local and the\
  \ connection I made with them will forever be the greatest memory I have from that\
  \ trip I took with my French class."
