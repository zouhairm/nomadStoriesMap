Text: "Wow, what a huge Buddha it is! And the train is just braking? I have to jump\
  \ out! \nPulling my belongings out of the bullet train just a seconds before the\
  \ door closes I look at the hill where I have seen the Buddha. Hidden behind a lamp\
  \ post I see a small sign with Buddha icon and small arrow and start in the shown\
  \ direction. \nAfter half an hour, late afternoon, I still see nothing but forest.\
  \ The road I was going on had no more indicators with Buddha symbol and it seems\
  \ to go the wrong direction. If I am to see the Buddha today I must find a shortcut!\
  \ I decide to just cut it straight up the hill through the forest. The slope is\
  \ steep and a little bit slippery, but I am determined to make it. The Buddha must\
  \ be there up!\nNext twenty minutes later - fully sweat-drenched and a bit muddy,\
  \ I arrive at the peak. Light twilight started, lucky that I feel so safe here in\
  \ Japan.  So where is this huge statue? I clearly saw it from the train and the\
  \ sign with the symbol was there, so why is it not visible? I head in the direction\
  \ I think it may be and there, hidden behind huge bushes, my Buddha sits with his\
  \ back to me. I jump down the high wall and go around. Wow! So magnificent! So peaceful!\
  \ Touched deep in my soul, I treasure the moment and look at him in awe. \nAt once\
  \ it is nearly dark. I bow deeply and as I turn I see that there is a huge staircase\
  \ leading up to the Buddha. That makes the way down so much easier! So I go down\
  \ happily, being in an elated state from my moment with him. It feels so good to\
  \ follow my spontaneous adventures! A few minutes later, I see some buildings with\
  \ a souvenir shop. Then I turn around and freeze - there is a huge gate, full of\
  \ spikes. And it has a huge chain and huge padlock on, tightly wrapped around both\
  \ sides of the gate. Some dogs are barking behind the otherwise dark houses. Somehow\
  \ it does not feel that safe anymore. I consider shortly going back up and climbing\
  \ the wall back to the forest but hearing the dogs lauder now it does not seem to\
  \ be the best idea. Blood rushing through my veins, flight fight reaction jumps\
  \ in. I must escape! Scanning the tight high bushes next to the gate I see a small\
  \ hole in the branches next to the ground. I push myself through, nearly falling\
  \ down the steep slope on the other side. There is a narrow ramp leading around\
  \ the gate and back to the freedom. As I run I hear dogs arriving at the gate, jumping\
  \ at it and barking. \nA meeting with Buddha I will definitely remember!"
