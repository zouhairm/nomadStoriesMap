Text: "Damn it! I\u2019ve messed everything up -once again- as she would not fail\
  \ to emphasize if only she were here. The point is that, right now, I\u2019m secluded\
  \ in this huge park with my phone that has already run out of battery. We were supposed\
  \ to visit this place together but then I found myself having to come here alone.\
  \ Thing is we put up a fight this morning, I believe it\u2019s that peculiar tension\
  \ that shows up especially when you\u2019re on vacation. You pass the whole year\
  \ working hard and you don\u2019t even want to face matters and, well, they just\
  \ keep adding up in a virtual agenda that suddenly becomes anything but virtual\
  \ when you have plenty of spare time for conversation. The name of the park is Villa\
  \ Pamphilj and we wanted to come back because it is provided with three very special\
  \ features: wide fields of poppies and, at dusk, the view of a thousand fireflies\
  \ that pulsate their bright lights in unison with the hypnotic buzz of the cicadas.\
  \ Have you ever heard that most of the wild flowers are now disappearing all around\
  \ the world due to pollution and intensive farming? This is a major environmental\
  \ issue because those flowers are in the lifecycle of other species. They say within\
  \ a few years we might not see a poppy anymore and that\u2019s very sad, especially\
  \ for me, because this flower recalls me the sweetest memories. We planned to lay\
  \ here like we used to do many years ago, with the fireflies and the cicadas performing\
  \ their magic, invoking the pleasures of a warm Italian night. I bought this bottle\
  \ of Montepulciano but I assume I will have to give it a try on my own, if I will\
  \ ever succeed to open it, seeing that she was the one in charge of the picnic basket,\
  \ which included the corkscrew. Well, here I am, sitting on the grass in a late\
  \ evening of the end of June. The well-known Roman heat just stopped torturing me\
  \ and these dry fields. Parents are regaining their children, jogging die-hards\
  \ are stepping the last effort towards an imaginary finish line and everyone else\
  \ is getting ready to go back home: the sky is turning darker as each minute passes\
  \ by. Suddenly birds have shut their uvula at the same time of their wings: an unexpected\
  \ silence lets me hear clearly the strident sound of the cicadas while a soft wind\
  \ shakes the threads of wheat and the vivid red poppies; the sun is completely below\
  \ the horizon, the stage is set, I can finally see the fireflies! It\u2019s wonderful\
  \ and you know, the most unexpected gift is..... hearing her distant voice calling\
  \ my name!"
