Text: "\u201CDisculpe senior, how much for the alpaca poncho?\u201D\nThe wrinkled\
  \ and bent old man stood without difficulty and crossed the small space; taking\
  \ the soft garment from me he eyes it suspiciously \n\u201CTwenty-thousand-pesos.\u201D\
  \ \nWords muffled in a heavy accent. If I had heard this a month ago on arrival\
  \ in Bogota I would have given the shrewd man the eight bucks and left, now I wasn\u2019\
  t so na\xEFve. \n\u201CThat\u2019s much too much, what do you take me for?\u201D\
  \nThe man\u2019s eyebrows raised and so did the layers of skin above them. He clearly\
  \ wasn\u2019t used to gangly white women haggling over a few thousand pesos.\n\u201C\
  Is a good price. You are calling me a liar?\u201D The lines between his eyes hardened.\n\
  \u201CNo, I think this is very nice, but it\u2019s worth ten-thousand,\u201D\n\u201C\
  Pah.\u201D He spat on the dusty road outside his stall.\n\u201CEighteen.\u201D\n\
  \u201CTwelve is fair.\u201D \nHe scowled \u201Cseventeen.\u201D\n\u201CThirteen.\u201D\
  \ I reply calmly\n\u201Cseventeen or nada.\u201D\nI shrug and turn to leave, walking\
  \ three steps I hear his gruff voice call out \n\u201CStop. Fifteen\u201D\nI turn\
  \ and walk back, the contorted lines of his face relax and his eyes twinkle knowingly.\
  \ \n\u201CTough deal, but you are a nice girl.\u201D He says slapping me on the\
  \ shoulder.\nSmiling I hand him the money, I had always planned to pay fifteen.\
  \ \nIt is a custom in Colombia to bargain, you disrespect the vendor if you don\u2019\
  t.\n\nI walk down one of the streets of the crowded market place, this was not a\
  \ place for those with a sensitive stomach. One street is dedicated solely to fish\
  \ and red meat, and although it is four streets behind me I can still smell the\
  \ acrid stench of meat covered in the sun covered in flies. Entering a new road\
  \ the smells; spices, freshly cut vegetables, cooking and the heady smell of Aguapanela,\
  \ a traditional Colombian tea, gently tickle my nostrils alerting my stomach to\
  \ its presence, it growls expectantly. I have never tasted anything like the dishes\
  \ in these humble roadside stalls. Even if an ongoing course of supplements follows\
  \ me wherever I go. Ducking under a shelter I order such a meal from a round, brightly\
  \ dressed woman who looks as though she had been cooking and feeding people all\
  \ her life. I feel sudden and enormous respect for this woman, which only grows\
  \ as she hands me the steaming pile of delicious smelling lentils, meat, polenta\
  \ and vegetables. I smile in appreciating, our eyes meet they tell me she knows\
  \ what I am feeling, and they speak of gratitude. \nAs I walk I muse, these people\
  \ live hard and difficult lives, a little kindness to strangers goes a long way."
