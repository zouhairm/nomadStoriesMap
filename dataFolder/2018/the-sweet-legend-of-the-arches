Text: "Almost an hour into our descend from San Lucas Sanctuary, our knees felt fragile\
  \ and fatigue hit us. Or perhaps it was the smell of freshly baked Italian pastries\
  \ and cake that made us pause. Seduced by the dessert display, we entered a confectionary\
  \ for a break.\nAfter visiting the egg yolk-coloured church of San Lucas on a hill\
  \ 300 metres above Bologna's center, that presents everlasting town views that shrink\
  \ to meet the horizon, my dad, sister and I decided to take the long walk down the\
  \ 666 arches that lead back into town. Somewhere along the way our noses and restless\
  \ feet led us to this small confectionary that proved to be a sweet experience beyond\
  \ its desserts.\nIn a mix of Spanish and broken Italian, we ordered our prizes.\
  \ A kind-smiled woman welcomed us and an even friendlier man served us our cannoli.\
  \ During a brief chat of our ventures we discovered a common language; Spanish.\
  \ Two Cypriots with a passion for this delicious Hispanic language and two Italians\
  \ married to Spanish-speakers. And so, in a short yet memorable conversation, this\
  \ bright-eyed woman addressed a query most travellers of Bologna have; why it has\
  \ so many arches.\nShe began her story like a novel fairytale. \"500 years ago\"\
  \ she said, \"there was severe poverty and famine in Bologna due to the lack of\
  \ rain\". People, desperate and faithful, pledged to Virgin Mary in San Lucas' Sanctuary\
  \ who told them to build arches to protect them of the heavy rain that was about\
  \ to fall. Since then, it rains intensely every year on that day. \n\"When is that\
  \ day?\" I asked her curiously. Her answer cracked a smile on my face. \"The 28th\
  \ of October? That's my birthday!\" I exclaimed as she grabbed her cheeks in awe.\
  \ Her finger pointed to a cake in the display \"Torta de riso (rice cake). We offer\
  \ this cake on that day as a sort of celebration\".\nTruth is, this traditional\
  \ cake of the Emilia Romagna region is prepared for many occasions, mainly during\
  \ Easter. Yet is the perfect finishing touch of what sounds like an ancient legend.\n\
  Several restaurant recommendations later, we bid our goodbyes as I held the confectionary's\
  \ card tightly.  Captivated by what seemed like a magnificent myth, I called the\
  \ bakery upon returning home to catch more details. A story passed down from generation\
  \ to generation, holding intact an identity, a faith and a memory that encompasses\
  \ Bologna.\nThese are the treasures we hope to unfold when travelling. These legends\
  \ and these people who give you a peak into the local culture."
