Text: "The Salar de Uyuni is quite simply a magnificent place. A white terrain that\
  \ stretches thousands of miles, untouched, and devoid of any sign of human existence,\
  \ allowing the sparse space to be an area of sheer magnitude. Naturally, as is with\
  \ any unique and wonderful place nowadays, the tourists flock in their droves, each\
  \ hiring tour guides to navigate them over the vast terrain, stopping at mesmerising\
  \ tiny islands which protrude from the surface. Yet, somehow this area just engulfs\
  \ anything and everyone, and no matter what way you look there is space to allow\
  \ you to believe, that you are completely alone. \n\nThough, it is at night that\
  \ this part of the world comes to life. With no light pollution for hundreds, if\
  \ not thousands of miles, the sky is so magnificently bright, that you feel like\
  \ the stars are within touching distance and you contemplate whether taking a souvenir\
  \ for yourself is within reason. Now, imagine this, imagine the beauty that sits\
  \ right above your head, getting neck ache because you simply cannot withdraw your\
  \ eyes from the lightning storm a thousand miles away, or watching the shooting\
  \ stars promise you a hundred wishes a minute, all the while sitting warm within\
  \ the natural hot tub that has, as if by magic, appeared in the perfect location.\
  \ \n\nOf course, all of this sounds perfect, and to some, the idea of being alone\
  \ here adds sheer excitement to the whole experience. However, at this very moment,\
  \ being surrounded by laughter, chatting and silence, creates an experience to match\
  \ no other. Seeing the expression on other faces, that mirror your own, gasping\
  \ at something none of you has ever witnessed before, and feeling a connection unmatched\
  \ by any previous. The people you started the trip with, strangers who you awkwardly\
  \ exchanged pleasantries, are the ones who, overnight, become stapled into your\
  \ memory, and will forever hold their place.\n\nThis was the last thing I expected\
  \ when I visited the desolate land of the Salar de Uyuni. I arrived on my own, excited\
  \ to see what everyone had promised was an awe-inspiring experience. The vast lands\
  \ captured my imagination, the night sky simply took my breath away, but the memory\
  \ of that moment, the way the story is always told, includes the people I met, and\
  \ how without them, none of what I say would be as meaningful. In actual fact, each\
  \ experience had, on any trip I have been lucky to do, has always been influenced\
  \ by the thing that is everywhere, but the last thing I expect, the people."
