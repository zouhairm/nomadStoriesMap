Text: "I had heard about this place numerous times and read about what life had been\
  \ like 80 years or so ago. People used to wear traditional costumes, washed their\
  \ clothes on the river Crna, had no electricity and lived in the same house with\
  \ the cattle. Surely, things have changed since. \nWhat is now left of the villages\
  \ in Mariovo, a huge area in the soutwest of  Macedonia, are  abandoned  houses\
  \  and thorny gardens overgrown with useless weeds. There are also few toothless,\
  \ old men and women whose deep wrinkles tell a story of loneliness and fading memories\
  \ of times when they had felt alive. \nI reached the village Kruseica and admired\
  \ the scenery: snowy mountain peaks in the distance, clear blue skies and enormous\
  \ cotton \u2013like clouds \u2026. and deafening silence.\n I was thirsty and tired.\
  \ I noticed a tap in front of a tiny church. It was broken so I went up in hope\
  \ I would find someone .A very young and beautiful black haired woman in jeans came\
  \ out of the church  . She couldn\u2019t have been more than 24. I smiled, went\
  \ up to her and said hello. She said nothing but looked at me and smiled back. I\
  \ thought she might be deaf so I pantomimed \u2018water drinking\u2019.  She led\
  \ me into the church where she handed me an old and somewhat rusty iron mug.\nAs\
  \ we sat on the only bench a cat entered and she started speaking to her in a language\
  \ I recognized.  Her face lit when I said few words in my broken Albanian. I struggled\
  \ to ask if she was a tourist or a guest or a wanderer like me, when a white \u2013\
  haired man came in. He explained that he had been \u2018in charge\u2019 of  the\
  \ church for the last 40 years. He answered my question by saying in a hoarse voice\
  \ : \u2018Well\u2026 there are four of us left ! Including my wife here!'\nHe invited\
  \ me to their house and as I went in I glanced at her and my heart sank. While he\
  \ was out fetching something she took my hand and said something. I could just understand\
  \ the word \u2018sad\u2019. When he came back he told me he had bought his wife\
  \ from Albania. He added that although beautiful and  expensive she turned out to\
  \ be a rather slow learner and  because she couldn\u2019t understand \u2018our\u2019\
  \ language they could not say much. But he didn\u2019t want to die alone. She just\
  \ nodded not understanding. She hugged me when I was leaving and I held her tight\
  \ for some time. I bought a dictionary the next day and learned all the synonyms\
  \ for \u2018sadness\u2019. I felt like eating up all the random words and swallowing\
  \ my tears to fill in the void."
