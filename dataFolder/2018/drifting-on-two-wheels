Text: "When I imagined 2017, I didn't envisage much cycling, much travel, most certainly\
  \ not both as a positive combination. I owned a cheap road bike which I occasionally\
  \ rolled around on; pleasurably wasting a Sunday afternoon. So to be planning a\
  \ cycling trip around the European continent with my partner was something that\
  \ certainly pushed me to the edge. To still be going, 10 months on, 12,000km, and\
  \ 20 countries later, and he is still by my side is the VERY last thing that I expected.\P\
  \n\nTravelling so painfully slowly with a bicycle carrying very limited things,\
  \ to most people seems questionable. Why would you? The decision means I have been\
  \ stripped bare of my identity, I swapped lipstick, and skirts, for lycra and waterproofs\
  \ and set out on a journey that has completely thrown normality into the wind. I've\
  \ learned to make on the spot decisions and have gained confidence that it is absolutely\
  \ ok to be me. As for our relationship, we have just about uncovered everything\
  \ mortally possible. Privacy just doesn't exist in the wild.\P\n\nCyclotourism as\
  \ a way of travel is the future. It allows you to see, hear, feel and smell every\
  \ part of the journey. And what's more, it's FREE to pedal. No longer is travel\
  \ just about a specific city or place but the long road that takes you there. By\
  \ making this choice, we have stumbled across people from all walks of life, learnt\
  \ about different cultures first hand, shared recipes, camped freely in the most\
  \ natural of spaces and have been welcomed into a community full of character. When\
  \ else would you be hosted by a man that has travelled solo around the world on\
  \ the power of two legs? The Warmshowers.org community and a bike, allows this to\
  \ happen.\P\n\nFor a female, giving up my job and home to live in the outdoors has\
  \ been tough. We have suffered all weathers, be it the 40 degree sweltering heat,\
  \ thunderstorms, snow or the minus temperatures that have turned our tent crisp\
  \ white. But it's surprising how quickly we have adapted to each situation, taking\
  \ one day and one kilometre at a time.\P\n\nAt present we have joined the community\
  \ of the pilgrims. Travelling the route of St James, as we head home, once again\
  \ means we have been saved by the kindness of humanity. The Albergue's asking for\
  \ a donation of our means, have allowed us to feel the comfort of a warm bed, food\
  \ and a hot coffee again.\n\n\PI therefore challenge you to challenge yourself,\
  \ be it one day, one week or one year, and experience the beauty of drifting on\
  \ two wheels."
