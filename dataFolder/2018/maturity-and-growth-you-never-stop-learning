Text: "In my high school general knowledge is acquired,but they don't make young understand\
  \ the importance of this cultural baggage neither they let explore us the practical\
  \ side.After the graduation I had to travel in my personality that I actually did\
  \ it, physically and mentally.I'm one of those curious people who really want to\
  \ learn.First I devalued my memory skills,but things must be understood and we must\
  \ know how to transmit and apply them.They never encouraged me in this high school\
  \ where I spent five years with the same professors and classmates.So I decided\
  \ after graduation to go to Nice.I have already traveled alone but this time it\
  \ was different,I had to go and live alone.Just before leaving I fell in love with\
  \ a guy in Rome.In certain things we had much in common in others we were opposites,he\
  \ has what I lacked.I studied economics,involved from the ideas of my parents,with\
  \ them I hadn't a good relationship.From that moment I had to learn to handle a\
  \ lot of things that I was not used to.I felt fragile and alone at first despite\
  \ there was people around me.I have made many trips all over France and job experiences.In\
  \ the meantime, my boyfriend was very sad and wanted often to hear me on the phone,he\
  \ was worried that I wasn\u2019t really interested about him.I had entrusted myself\
  \ to him emotionally.He did not agree with my choice of university that pushed me\
  \ to sign up in a private school in Rome where they accepted applications until\
  \ the end of November.My parents disappointed.In December he left me after a moment\
  \ of moral abatement I made myself strong.We got together again at the end of February\
  \ but the relationship had grown up.Finally I lacked a few exams to validate the\
  \ year.Here I had to make an important decision.Communication obvious, but in France\
  \ or Rome?I remembered all the reasons for my desire to leave Rome, at the same\
  \ time I knew I would have more support in Rome.I decided Rome.A new Rome it seemed,when\
  \ the one that had changed was me.The first university year again,sometimes I feel\
  \ guilty about this delay.Be put on the edge, as in the box.When you lose your guard\
  \ and the technique you get overwhelmed.You have to fight for what you believe but\
  \ when you are wrong the adaption to something different is better.I'm very focused\
  \ on my future.We have little choices every day.What matters are the steps you take,the\
  \ path,not the goal.We need the objectives to go on,to try to do better.Our dreams\
  \ always aim high,it's good to make ourselves and the world better."
