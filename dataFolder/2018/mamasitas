Text: "I went to Peru in 2017 and I got to experience Machu Picchu and it was amazing\
  \ learning about the Incas and the different languages of Peru like cetchua and\
  \ there culture. I further explored Peru and went to lake Titicaca and learnt about\
  \ the locals and how they made there reed houses it was amazing and really opened\
  \ my mind!\nThen a few others and myself stayed just off the lake of lake Titicaca\
  \ and we stayed with some of the older native women which told us to call them mama\
  \ but we desided to call them mamasitas in the morning we had to get make our bed\
  \ have our breakfast and then take the sheep n the donkey and the cows to the lake\
  \ so they could get some water and the. We would feed them too then we would get\
  \ a rug lay it out side on the floor sit down get comfy and pick the corn curnals\
  \ from the cob of the corn and it made my thumbs red n sore n it took hours to do\
  \ we also had to then peak sooo many potatoes for everyone and then we would have\
  \ lunch and then play volleyball the mama\xEDtas loved it we played them verse us\
  \ and they won every time!!! Then all the corn we picked and the potatoes we peald\
  \ we made a kind of soup out of it for dinner was an amazing experience. And at\
  \ night it was so cold but we would fill our water bottles up with hot water and\
  \ hope the lid didn\u2019t come off n sleep with them in our beds, I also was lucky\
  \ enough to see how the made there llama wool and also how they coloured it with\
  \ the dye that they make themselves and then after the whole process they would\
  \ make these amazing blankets and scarves, socks, jumpers everything and all with\
  \ this wool on a wooden board and they weaved it in and out of the other bits of\
  \ wool creating pictures and colours and it was crazy and looked amazing they are\
  \ such smart intelligent people and the best thing I learnt from them was they only\
  \ take from the world what they need that goes for food, clothes, water everything\
  \ even animals they only would have as many sheep as they\nCould handle to sheer\
  \ and feed and water I thought it was amazing and they are so happy and are always\
  \ smiling and it was one of the best experiences of my life and I loved learning\
  \ about them and there culture and I will always remember everything they taught\
  \ me and just giving back to the world by planting a simple flower or tree as they\
  \ do and not to over by food they won\u2019t get eaten and that you should always\
  \ smile no matter and that picking corn isn\u2019t as easy as it looks and I will\
  \ also never forget what real corn looks like."
