Text: "Nothing can prepare you to comprehend the essence of the Australian Outback.\
  \ \n \nYou know when you have arrived in the Outback. The enormous vibrant blue\
  \ sky slaps you in the face demanding to be noticed. As the sun sets, the boundless\
  \ clear sky begins to illuminate in utter brilliance. You futilely count the stars\
  \ until your mind ceases to conceive the infinite space. You begin to shrink.\n\n\
  Everything is measured by a line of zeros behind irrelevant numbers, apart from\
  \ rainfall. \nA three year old child may never have seen water fall from the sky.\
  \ \n  \nYou stare at ongoing stark, barren scenes, commanding void landscapes silences\
  \ you.\nYou pull over and kick the seemingly infertile red soil which spews on everything\
  \ in its sight, and wonder. \nWhy would anyone consider to create an existence in\
  \ this unforgiving land? \nYet some did and some tried. Some flourished, some perished.\
  \ What compelled them to this land?\n\nThe Outback is where someone gives you directions\
  \ and points \u2018that\u2019s just up the road\u2019, 200 kms away.  \nWhere you\
  \ drive for a day and still be nowhere.\nWhere enormous rock formations majestically\
  \ rise out of the earth surrounded by hundreds of kms of dead flat ground.\nIt\u2019\
  s where the largest cattle station in the world sits, covering a whopping 24,000\
  \ sq kms.\nWhere summer temperatures soar above 40 degrees with no hint of a breeze\
  \ or shade in sight.\nWhere gigantic walls of red dust roll across the plains engulfing\
  \ everything in its path.\nIt\u2019s where the doctor and mail arrives by an aeroplane.\n\
  And where your nearest neighbour could be 500 kms away.\n\nDriving along the relentless\
  \ straight roads, you seldom see another vehicle. Out of the blue, a monstrous road\
  \ train thunders by transporting cattle, delivering fuel, food and goods to the\
  \ remote towns. The lifelines for the vast Outback.\n\nYet, early settlers arrived\
  \ by horse, slowly driving a mob of cattle over thousands of kilometres. So difficult\
  \ to imagine their blind faith on an arduous journey into a totally unfamiliar,\
  \ brutal land. \n\nMonths of roaming the Outback, glimpses flashed as to why people\
  \ created a life against great odds in a most inhospitable land imaginable. \n \n\
  One day I exhaled, sensing its all compelling beauty and understood the why. \n\
  The Outback humbles you where words cease to have meaning.\nThe vast space creates\
  \ a sense of personal freedom devoid of limitations, where you must rely on yourself.\
  \ \n\nLife in the Outback ultimately becomes a profound relationship between you\
  \ and the land."
