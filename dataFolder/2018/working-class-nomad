Text: "My first experience of travelling began in Iceland during Easter 2016. Myself\
  \ and a close friend went on a week long trip to the land of ice and fire to discover\
  \ all things natural. After a few paid for tours of the Golden circle and the western\
  \ peninsula, we decided to rough it and camp out along the south coast using only\
  \ one tent and the kindness of drivers to take us further along the coast. We decided\
  \ to stop off at a large waterfall and made the call to climb up it with our backpacks\
  \ on to see the views from the top. It was magnificent and it was a view unique\
  \ to us. The next day we followed the river up, finding multiple untouched waterfalls,\
  \ ice caves and ravines. We climbed and hiked for hours. Being a naive traveller\
  \ I carried my passport on me rather than leave it in camp. When I jumped across\
  \ a particularly difficult part of the river, my passport, and only form of ID I\
  \ had, flew out of my pocket and was instantly lost in the rapid water. I clambered\
  \ over rocks and snow to try and save it from cascading over the waterfall. Much\
  \ to my distress, I was unable to save the document. As I turned to tell my friend,\
  \ he was posing at a particularly dodgy spot over the waterfall and when I told\
  \ him, his first response was \u201Cokay, but please take a photo of me here first!\u201D"
