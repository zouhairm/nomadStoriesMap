Text: 'Hope is everything, is the pillar of life, the light of the road, the sad smile,
  the address of tomorrow, the goal. I will write today about my experiences with
  the hope of the two states of Sudan. Sudan is a beautiful country, but you need
  to eat so that you can live in it. Yes, it is harsh and painful. It makes you cry,
  but it remains national. Hope remains the title of every tomorrow for me. I am unable
  to describe my suffering. My ambition and my dreams that have been destroyed by
  this country, but I hope that tomorrow is the best and that I am stronger than all
  the odds. I will bear everything until I reach my goal, so that I will try, I am
  writing today my story with hope with ambition with suffering. To be a well-educated
  man, despite the harsh circumstances and the impossible things that stand in my
  face, I am confused and sometimes sad but I do not want to I want to study abroad
  and I want to travel around the world. I want to study abroad. I will try to reach
  my goal because I am a believer and I am confident I will be able to. Do this even
  if you are in the bed of death ..

  Zelal salah..'
