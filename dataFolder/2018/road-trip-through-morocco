Text: "In the Spring of 2016, while studying in Rome, my friends and I decided that\
  \ we wanted to see the Sahara Desert. So after a week of minimal planning, a four\
  \ hour flight, and a two hour slow march through customs we found ourselves in Marrakech.\
  \ We walked out of the airport into the hot North African sun and found our driver\
  \ wearing a bright blue djellaba. He was leaning against a rusted army green jeep\
  \ and looking overall unimpressed. No doubt we were not the first American students\
  \ that he had taken into the desert, a fact that I was painfully aware of and hoped\
  \ I could improve upon. \nThe six of us squeezed into the jeep. I volunteered to\
  \ take the back middle seat, hoping that it would pay off later. With a deadpan\
  \ face our guide drove us through the city while Moroccan music played over the\
  \ radio. He turned onto the main road and we were on our way. I could not wait to\
  \ see the sweeping dunes of the massive desert. However, my ignorance was quickly\
  \ exposed as the driver informed us that the Sahara desert was an 8 hour drive from\
  \ Marrakech. Upon hearing this, the local radio seemed to get louder. We drove through\
  \ vast open plains, and up the rocky roads of Morocco\u2019s mountains. The sites\
  \ we saw were among the most beautiful I had ever set my eyes upon. However, like\
  \ with all great road trips, the music started to wear on me. \nSix hours passed.\
  \ The sun hung low in the sky, and my back was sore. Luckily for me, it was my turn\
  \ to ride shotgun. After some prodding glances from my friends, I asked the driver,\
  \ as politely as I could if he had an auxiliary cord that I could use to play music.\
  \ There seemed to be a deep disappointment behind his eyes and in that moment I\
  \ felt like I had become every other American student that he knew. He turned off\
  \ the radio and handed me the cord. I proceeded to shamefully scroll through my\
  \ songs when he turned and asked, \u201CCan you play Hotel California?\u201D I remember\
  \ being so shocked that I almost did not understand him. After an awkward pause\
  \ I managed to say, \u201Cof course!\u201D and selected the Eagle\u2019s classic.\
  \ His eyes lit up as he cranked the volume. The old jeep seemed to hum as the unmistakable\
  \ guitar intro rang out. Before I knew it he was belting out the words and we were\
  \ all singing along with him. When the song ended he told us that Hotel California\
  \ was a favorite in Morocco, something I never would have known. We then continued\
  \ our journey to the Sahara Desert, down a dark desert highway, with a new friend."
