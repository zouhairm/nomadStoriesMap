Text: "I arrive by tram an hour after landing, the bitter chill a good few degrees\
  \ lower than home. I arrive with a heart in need of healing, a spirit still fighting,\
  \ a soul still searching. The air is cold, but the shining sun warms my heart. I\
  \ like the practicality of the transport system, and the people, who seem to have\
  \ a familiar reserved nature \u2013 quiet and softly spoken. \n\nThere is a sombreness\
  \ in the air that seems to hang over the city from the country\u2019s dark history,\
  \ mirroring my own sorrow. I cannot bring myself to step on the metal faces in the\
  \ installation at the Jewish Museum. The clanging sounds from around the corner\
  \ had sounded like gas chamber screams, and so instead I stare at the faces as they\
  \ disappear into the dark tunnel, powerless. \n\nHaving learnt about the Nazi occupation\
  \ and war throughout school, I don\u2019t expect to be shocked. Yet at the Holocaust\
  \ Memorial, the numbers \u2013 larger than imaginable \u2013 shock me all over again.\
  \ I read and listen to stories of people all over Europe, most of whom were murdered,\
  \ some who were able to escape and survive. I read the letter from a twelve year\
  \ old and it breaks my heart in a whole new way. \n\nWhat is all the more frightening\
  \ is the quotation from Primo Levi: \u2018It happened, therefore it can happen again:\
  \ this is the core of what we have to say\u2019. In the exhibit on Jerusalem, I\
  \ read about the current conflict between Israel and Palestine, the shocking actions\
  \ of some Jewish soldiers, and I\u2019m moved by the footage of Orthodox Jews marching\
  \ against Zionism and the State of Israel. With Putin, Trump, and everything else\
  \ in the world, it can be overwhelming to think about it all.   \n\nI hadn\u2019\
  t expected to work through the trauma of the country and be filled somehow with\
  \ a sense of hope. I walk down the long stretch of the Berlin Wall, filled with\
  \ swirls of colour, and messages of peace and protest. I reflect on everything I\
  \ see as I fill my stomach with pretzels covered in salt crystals, fresh amber beer,\
  \ and hearty bratwurst sausages. \n\nThe feeling inside me echoes the warmth I feel\
  \ when coming inside from the cold: peeling gloves off my hands, uncoiling the scarf\
  \ from my neck, unleashing my hair from my woolly hat, combing my fringe back in\
  \ place. I get my daily hot chocolate, greeted with the shy Mona Lisa smile of the\
  \ barista. From my own broken heart to the big broken world I live in, I leave Berlin\
  \ feeling like there is a way to hope, and move forward."
