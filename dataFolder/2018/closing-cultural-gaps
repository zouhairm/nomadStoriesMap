Text: "I prepared my suitcases in Argentina thinking what I would find at the new\
  \ airport gate, what new smells, new horizons, or new customs I will experience\
  \ as I merged in a new and intriguing culture.\nAs the airplane arrived to Colorado,\
  \ my excitement for practicing my English grew. As I got out of the airplane, I\
  \ discovered that many years of college had not been enough to express my needs.\
  \ However, it was my limited English that helped me to get to Copper Mountain. Making\
  \ a local connection was my ultimate goal, getting to know Americans, and building\
  \ relationships was my purpose.  \nWhen I drove through the mountains, the scene\
  \ I saw was breath taking. The sun reflected on the bus\u2019 window was warm, bright\
  \ and gave a sense of peace as I rested my eyes on the horizon. It was also the\
  \ first time I realized that the local food did have a new flavor, a new smell and\
  \ yet, it did not carry the spices and the consistency that only food from Argentina\
  \ had. I was invaded by many feelings, all of them reminded the times that I dreamed\
  \ to be in Colorado, getting to know others and making connections. Those same feelings\
  \ gave me the incentive to break through the anxiety that was in me as I continued\
  \ discovering how to navigate in a new bus system, a new language, and most of all,\
  \ and a new way to communicate. \nAs I walked on the packed crushed snow, I got\
  \ closer to the local ski rental. The smell of plastic and wool brought me back\
  \ memories in which my grandmother used to net.  The constant back and forth of\
  \ present and past continued coming to me, creating a mix of emotions, all of them\
  \ leading to the same question, how do I make connections? I thought that by having\
  \ in my mind past experiences and new ones, it will limit me from getting to know\
  \ new people. I was afraid of being by myself at a ski resort, communicating with\
  \ my limited English and attempting to survive during the three months that I planned\
  \ to stay in Colorado. Little I knew that as I walked through the lobby, a new world\
  \ of opportunities opened for me. \nIt was by working at the same ski resort where\
  \ I got to meet wonderful people, all coming from all over the world, all seeking\
  \ to connect with one another and learning from each other. I was also through the\
  \ same experience that I discovered what my passion was, to help people to become\
  \ aware of the cultural differences by building bridges that make people aware of\
  \ the wonders that each culture has to offer for others and for themselves."
