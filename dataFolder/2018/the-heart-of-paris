Text: "I was drunk on a bicycle. \nThe sensation was familiar, after a year struggling\
  \ through divorce. The goals were the same: to just stay upright and keep pedaling\
  \ forward. \nIt was this spirit of desperation to move forward after the final papers\
  \ were signed that landed me in the middle seat on a plane departing Newark for\
  \ Paris. Beside me sat a woman, who owned a Parisian tour company. She took my itinerary\
  \ and promptly put it in the trash. \n\u201CYou are missing the heart of the city.\
  \ I\u2019m giving you a new schedule.\u201D she said with finality. \nThat is how\
  \ I found myself 24 hours later renting a bicycle at a tour shop. As a solo traveler,\
  \ my forced companion would be a man from Australia alone on holiday. I hadn\u2019\
  t ridden a bike in 10 years, I admitted nervously. Uncertain about my ability, I\
  \ fell to the back of the group.   \nThe end of the tour required us to board a\
  \ Seine cruise. Our guide brought out bottles of wine, and as the boat set sail\
  \ the wine and the stories flowed freely. Wine has a way of eliciting the truth,\
  \ and with each bottle passed we all came alive. I laughed from a place of raw joy\
  \ for the first time in months. I uncovered a similar story as mine in my fellow\
  \ traveler. The Australian had come to Paris too with a broken heart.\nComing off\
  \ the boat, I managed to crawl onto the bike, internally unsure if it was the wine\
  \ or the way the he said my name that was causing me to be lightheaded. I started\
  \ to pedal, now overconfident. The bike began to fall, sending me with it laughing\
  \ to the ground, bruising more than my pride. \n\u201CWoman, you are making me bloody\
  \ nervous,\u201D he said laughing. \nReturning the bikes, as a group we walked to\
  \ the Eiffel Tower. Another few bottles of wine, a gift from the tour operator,\
  \ made the journey with us. We sat on the grass under the iconic landmark, and as\
  \ time passed what began as a group of strangers was quickly becoming old friends.\
  \ My Australian crush gave a toast to new beginnings. When his glass touched mine,\
  \ he winked. Something inside me long extinguished began once again to softly glow.\
  \ \nWhen it was time for goodbyes, he walked with me away from the group. As the\
  \ tower began to glitter with light, he softly kissed me in the dark. As I floated\
  \ through the city streets back to my hotel, I knew this trip was no longer a reward\
  \ for surviving something tragic, it was about celebrating the unexpected moments\
  \ of a life made new. \nSometimes a fresh start finds you when you least expect\
  \ it, drunk on a bicycle in Paris."
