Text: "We were sitting at the Tuk-tuk who would take us to the train station. The\
  \ driver, always the same one, told me about his house, how he got to buy the tuk-tuk\
  \ and that he was Buddhist which is not a problem to marry a catholic girl. I could\
  \ not believe that he was asking for my daughter. Beatriz seating by my side, told\
  \ him that she was studying medicine, so she had to go back to finish the university.\
  \ \n\u201CWell, that is not a problem\u201D- he said- we will marry later. \nDuring\
  \ our conversation he drove very fast through Waikkal, crossing the main road. The\
  \ butcher, with half the cow hanging at the door, the car repair full of broken\
  \ tuk-tuk parts and the small pharmacy, were welcoming us. \nWe arrived at the train\
  \ station to go to Colombo wondering how we had arrived safely there. Three steps\
  \ up to buy the train tickets, a station manager who told us that the train will\
  \ be around 20 minutes late and an impossible to read carton ticket in our hand.\
  \ \nLaughs from a family sitting at the open waiting room, earth floors, green banks\
  \ whose painting had known better times and 4 little kids, who with broken English\
  \ told us to wait there. There were laughing about our Spanish speaking. The oldest\
  \ one, a beautiful dark boy with sunny eyes, whispered words to his brother`s ear,\
  \ Tamil words we would never be able to understand were spoken very quietly. His\
  \ brother with the hand covering his broken smile laughed hard. The girls imitated\
  \ her brothers. None of them had shoes on. The mother smiled at me, telling me something\
  \ I was sorry I could not understand. \nA 2-year-old girl, was fascinated with my\
  \ spanish \"abanico\", I gave it to her and she dance showing it to her mum. We\
  \ thought that we could learn some words, so taking a paper and a pen,decided to\
  \ sit on the bank with the 4 children around us. We draw a sun put the Spanish word\
  \ on it SOL and told them to give us the right Tamil pronunciation. An impossible\
  \ word was said, so I gave the older brother my pen and he put \u201C\u0B9A\u0BC2\
  \u0BB0\u0BBF\u0BAF\u0BA9\u0BCD (Kuriyan)\u201D on it. We could not avoid trying\
  \ to pronounce the word, and the children could not stop laughing. Another try,\
  \ I draw a moon, put the Spanish word LUNA in my paper, and the boy wrote \u0B9A\
  \u0BA8\u0BCD\u0BA4\u0BBF\u0BB0\u0BA9\u0BCD. The game went on and on during the 2\
  \ hours we were waiting,the little girl took my pen and draw something only little\
  \ girls could understand. The mother never left the smile behind, we had the best\
  \ waiting time I have had in my life and the tamil family will always be a part\
  \ of our trip to Sri Lanka."
