Text: "Every time I travel with my parents or friends we go as a group of comfortable\
  \ lot trying to explore safe things in a preplanned way, making provisions to properly\
  \ rest and plan a leisure trip away from nature in hotel rooms and restaurants.\
  \ We just visited places not actually been there. So I wanted to step out of my\
  \ comfort zone and actually enrolled for a beach camping trip for one weekend. I\
  \ went it blind without knowing what exactly to expect except the list of things\
  \ which we must carry for the trip given by the organizer. The first day of the\
  \ trip was out of the ordinary to travel with unknown people as no one knew the\
  \ other person. Then started the introductions, sharing of experiences and over\
  \ just a couple of days we grew very familiar and started looking out for each other\
  \ and that was such a novice experience. We reached our beach trail start place\
  \ in the afternoon of day 1, it was a hill top with beach view. The amazing view\
  \ knocked me off my feet, the splendor blue sky the blue green waters of the beach\
  \ and the cool breeze, all was surreal. I couldn\u2019t get enough and wanted the\
  \ trail walk to start already. So it began."
