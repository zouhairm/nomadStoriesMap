Text: "The plane touches down on tarmac so new that it seems it might be still wet.\
  \ At the end of the runway, a half-constructed building stands swathed in bamboo\
  \ scaffolding. It looks alarmingly like a control tower. We step off the plane and\
  \ into the African sun, blinking. There are no buses needed to transport us to the\
  \ non-existent terminal building, just a few steps cut into a grassy bank for us\
  \ to climb, and beyond, a chain link fence and our new friends, waiting for us.\
  \ \n Hawassa. Four hours south of Addis Ababa and perched alongside a beautiful\
  \ blue lake. To our English eyes it looks enormous, but search for it on a map and\
  \ it hardly blinks at you, insignificant amongst the enormous craters littering\
  \ the Rift Valley. We clamber into our minibus, unsticking our sticky skin from\
  \ faux-leather coverings poked through with escaping foam, and bump down the dirt\
  \ track towards the town. My daughters peer out of the window at young boys, raggedly\
  \ balancing on carts pulled along by donkeys, laden down with cut reeds, bricks,\
  \ containers filled with water. We pass round, thatched huts where women and children\
  \ crouch down in the red earth to cook. They look up at us as we pass. I squeeze\
  \ my daughter\u2019s hand \u2018You OK?\u2019 I ask. She smiles, nods at me, turns\
  \ back to the window. \u2018It\u2019s hot,\u2019 she says. \nLater that day we walk\
  \ beside Lake Hawassa. The cobbled path is freshly laid, in parts, complete; in\
  \ parts, bare earth piled high so that we have to clamber around it like rock climbers.\
  \ Locals stroll the not-yet-perfect promenade in sky-scraper heels that defy the\
  \ terrain. The smell of smoked fish rises up from colourful shacks where music plays\
  \ and friends gather. Traders lay their wares on blankets and we strain our eyes\
  \ to spot a hippo. None today, but there is still time. The girls jump back with\
  \ fright, laughing, as a Maribou Stork appears from the reeds, almost eye-height\
  \ to my youngest. \nHere is a city in flux. Industrial parks built hard against\
  \ pastoral communities. Promenades half-lengthened. But much remains unchanged.\
  \ Potholes. Poverty. Things half-done. Our first visit to Africa since having children\
  \ has not been without some trepidation. How will they cope with the heat, the food,\
  \ the things they have not seen before? We have come to volunteer in an orphanage,\
  \ and there too, they are overwhelmed at first. But not for long. This is Africa,\
  \ and it gets inside your soul. \n\u2018When are we coming back?\u2019 she asks\
  \ almost as soon as we are home. Soon, I promise. Soon."
