Text: "I was just starting the new 2018 year fired for an awesome job that I have\
  \ just started, decided to turn the page for good of a painful relationship with\
  \ a person to whom I had a great emotional connection that has been going on for\
  \ four years, had a great deal of disagreements with my family and I was lost, broken,\
  \ weak or so I thought. An unexpected trip came just at the right time with the\
  \ right person. I, along with my best friend took a fourteen-hour train to Southern\
  \ Egypt in Aswan specifically heading to Nubia, a calm and peaceful region alongside\
  \ the Nile River with colourful ecological houses, amazingly friendly people and\
  \ a breath-taking nature. \nThere, I realized to what extent our soul is deeply\
  \ connected to nature around us to an extent that this Nile that was peacefully\
  \ running on the land of my ancestors was actually part of who I am today; it is\
  \ the blood that runs in my veins, the mountains that surrounded me made me feel\
  \ how small our problems are and how big the world around us is. While wandering\
  \ across the city and visiting breath taking Pharaonic temples, we arrived at an\
  \ ancient grave that was built on the top of a mountain. We all started to climb\
  \ but after a while most of the group started to get tired and stopped. I continued\
  \ climbing and climbing, the adrenaline came higher and higher, I wanted to reach\
  \ the top. I kept climbing, forgetting everything around me, forgetting who I was\
  \ and why, when, what for and all the unnecessary questions we keep asking ourselves\
  \ all the time. I took a break from overthinking and lived truly in the present\
  \ moment. I made a connection to the mountains. It is only then that I discovered\
  \ my passion for heights, for climbing and how good I felt up there, how I truly\
  \ forgot the whole world and connected to my soul. Traveling makes us inspired by\
  \ details, enjoy the little things and make connections with local people, with\
  \ the nature, the odours, the colors, the feeling, the smell and how this place\
  \ made us feel. I enjoy the stillness and serenity of the mountains."
