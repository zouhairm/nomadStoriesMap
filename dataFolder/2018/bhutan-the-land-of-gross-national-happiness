Text: "Over the course of my adult life, I have found different reasons to travel.\
  \ I started off with a bucket list of places I believed I must visit, but I then\
  \ realized it is more fulfilling to travel to explore local culture. I found tranquility\
  \ in mingling with complete strangers. My husband and I selected Bhutan as our honeymoon\
  \ destination even before we finalised our marriage date. Days after our wedding,\
  \ we packed our bags we set off on our motorbike to ride across the border of India\
  \ and explore this land with the highest \u2018Gross National Happiness\u2019. Even\
  \ at the border shared by India and Bhutan, we saw a marked distinction between\
  \ the people on either side. On one hand, there was the dust, noise and chaos of\
  \ the border town Jaigaon in India, and a few feet away, was the complete opposite\
  \ in its Bhutanese counterpart, Phuentsholing. As we rode across the multitude of\
  \ mountainous ranges that this tiny country sits on, we couldn\u2019t help witness\
  \ the smiles on calm faces going about their daily lives. The biggest question that\
  \ haunted me for a long time was \u2018what makes Bhutanese so happy despite their\
  \ harsh living conditions?\u2019 Over the course of the 10 days, I think I found\
  \ the answer to my question. Our very first night in Bhutan started with us being\
  \ unable to reach our intended destination. At dusk, unprepared for the biting cold,\
  \ we stopped at the only house we saw after miles of desolate, winding mountain\
  \ roads. The people inside were friendly and welcomed us with hot tea and a seat\
  \ by the fireplace. Despite their humble circumstances, they did their best to accommodate\
  \ us for the night. A few days later, as we made the holy trek to Paro Taktsang\
  \ Monastery on 1st of January, we encountered a number of Bhutanese families making\
  \ the same climb. Whenever we stopped to catch our breath, we observed the closeness\
  \ within these families, and their enthusiasm despite the difficult climb. Their\
  \ friendly banter and stories made the trek much easier for us. Bhutanese connect\
  \ by helping in whatever way possible. Our experience in this trip to Bhutan was\
  \ that of spiritual cleansing. We learned how to live in peace with ourselves. We\
  \ learned from the people we encountered how to handle stressful situations, how\
  \ to laugh and let go. How to balance personal time and yet work diligently. My\
  \ husband and I couldn\u2019t have thought of a better place to start our life together.\
  \ The prayer flags, the temple bells and joyful faces evoked a spiritual unity in\
  \ us."
