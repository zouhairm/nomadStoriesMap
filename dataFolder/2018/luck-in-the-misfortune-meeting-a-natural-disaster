Text: "I wanted to teach English in Guayaquil, the largest city and the chief port\
  \ of Ecuador, and to explore the communities from which my pupils had come from.\
  \ I wanted to eat encebollado - the albacore fish soup - served illegally from the\
  \ back of a van, touch the shell of the giant Gal\xE1pagos tortoise kept in the\
  \ courtyard of the ESPOL (Escuela Superior Polit\xE9cnica del Litoral) University\
  \ and drink the most popular non- alcoholic beverage - la avena polaca - whilst\
  \ lying in a hammock under the palm trees. I was one of the first foreigners to\
  \ move into the suburban \u201CEl Girasol\u201D area, a small gated community known\
  \ by their devotion to the Virgin Mary of Cisne.\n\nIt was a hot Friday afternoon\
  \ in April and I was lying down flat on my sofa with the chills shooting through\
  \ me. Despite the tropical heat, I was feeling cold. My hands were shaking so much\
  \ I couldn\u2019t even read the temperature from the thermometer. It was so strange\
  \ to walk to the pharmacy under the scorching sun, yet shiver from cold. I was told\
  \ I was running a high fever, got some paracetamol and walked back home. It could\
  \ have been anything, from flu to yellow fever or dengue. \n\nAfter a few hours,\
  \ around 7 pm I had the strangest sensation that my uncontrollable shivering made\
  \ the whole sofa shake with a rolling motion like I was at sea. The whole room began\
  \ to move, the objects were falling down from the shelves and the ceiling lights\
  \ were swaying too. I heard a great, unending scream piercing through nature. I\
  \ wondered if I was hallucinating or was this really happening? \n\nLights and power\
  \ went off. I was still shivering, the walls were moving, it was dark, but somehow\
  \ I managed to get downstairs and out of the house. \nSome people were gathered\
  \ near the statue of the Virgin Mary of Cisne, the others stood holding each other\
  \ in the doorways of their houses. Many were screaming and praying out loud. I felt\
  \ lost and out of control, it was all very surreal. I was looking up trying to guess\
  \ what is going to fall on my head first.\n\nSuddenly it stopped. \n\nWe were about\
  \ 300 km away from the epicentre of a 7.8 magnitude earthquake and the buildings\
  \ around us stood intact. We were lucky, nobody was hurt. I was sitting down on\
  \ the ground, resting and feeling grateful for being alive. Finally, my shivers\
  \ seemed to have left together with the temblor and I felt relieved. Hundreds of\
  \ people died, thousands were injured. Ecuador was mourning."
