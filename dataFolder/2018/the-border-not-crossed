Text: "On the third day after leaving official Georgia, we were heading back from\
  \ southern Abkhazia. We took a night ride to the border which takes us back to Georgia\
  \ doesn\u2019t open until about 8 a.m. The locals that gave us a lift decided to\
  \ make a break and kicked us out of the car, because there wasn\u2019t enough space\
  \ in their car for all of us to sleep. It was 2 am. A little bit to the front, there\
  \ was campfire two skinny men were lying on their sides next to it. When we realized\
  \ that we were to spend the night outside Milutin and I thought it was a good idea\
  \ we joined someone. The first showed us to go away, but when she politely insisted,\
  \ they said it was alright. Both of them were unkempt and tired, as if they had\
  \ been travelling much longer than us. Kobiladze, a bold guy with mustache, was\
  \ wearing worn out jeans and a probably too warm a jacket for a July night in the\
  \ mountains. The other one, Sulkhan, had  just a colorful light sweater on. I noticed\
  \ their Lada was overloaded.\"Smugglers\", I thought to myself.\u201CWho are you?\
  \ Journalists?\u201D, asked Sulkhan. \u201CNo, no, no. Students. From Serbia\u201D\
  , we replied confusedly. \u201CStudent? Are you sure?!\u201D, asked Sulkhan, while\
  \ Kobiladze continued. \u201CShow us your passports. Who were these people? Kobiladze\
  \ ran his fingertips down his moustache, got up and went to the car to get a map.\
  \ He spread it next to a gas bottle, and started pointing: \u2013 We started from\
  \ here, from Tbilisi. We are heading to Krasodar, in Russia, going all the way up\
  \ through Georgia. What do you mean, what is there?, he said slightly angrily as\
  \ Milutin pointed his finger to the South Ossetian region. There are our families.\
  \ My father and brother. The Russians banished them.\u201C \u201CThe road you are\
  \ taking is much longer\u201D I said. \u201CUnfortunately, the border is closed\u201D\
  , replied Kobiladze.\u201CAll the way down through the north of Georgia there is\
  \ a border kept by the Russian militants.  It wraps around the patch from both sides.\
  \ There are guards. They are said to be brutal. I shrugged on the thought of encountering\
  \ Russian militants on site of the most recent armed conflict in Europe. Milutin\
  \ kept peaceful next to me. I started to relax. \u201CIt is practically a country\
  \ of ghosts place now\u201D, Sulkhan said,with a mixture of anger and sorrow. \u201C\
  Do you think this conflict will end?\u201D I asked. \u201CFor now, they\u2019re\
  \ doing whatever they want, but one day\u201D, Kobiladze hit himself in the chest,\
  \ \u201Done day, all that will be ours again. Because that has always been our,\
  \ Georgian land\u201D."
