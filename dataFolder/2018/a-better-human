Text: "Well, maybe I could make this long story short but it would be completely unfair.\
  \ Because to tell you the adventure of backpacking in Asia I\u2019d need way more\
  \ than 140 characters and a couple of awesome photos from Cambodia\xB4s well-known\
  \ Angkor temple, greenish lagoons in Thailand or a meditation time at Bali\xB4s\
  \ Uluwatu Temple.\nLet me start from the very beginning. As born and raised in Brazil,\
  \ going to Asia is a hell of a long trip. Really. Besides the jetlag, a huge cultural\
  \ contrast and the language\xB4s challenge (most people don\xB4t speak English over\
  \ there), women traveling alone will always be a kind of issue. I don\xB4t know\
  \ why but every time I travel on my own, there is this voice in my head saying:\
  \ \u201Cwhy are you doing it all alone?\u201D Moreover, after visiting almost 30\
  \ different countries, I finally found the answer: this is the only way I can deeply\
  \ connect with my inner self and take that leap over the edge. \nThe last November\
  \ I spent 40 days traveling, meeting different kind of people and walking off my\
  \ comfort zone every single day with no more than a 12kg backpack with all I needed.\
  \ Besides that, I was open-minded and ready to live following the flow. Not so easy\
  \ but extremely exciting. \nThe trip started in Bali, a place I always wanted to\
  \ visit. The island is pure magic, with the highest positive vibrations one can\
  \ imagine - by the way, the incense smell is now part of my favorite\u2019s affective\
  \ memories. I spent a whole week over there until the volcano Mount Agung erupted\
  \ and the airport be closed for 48 hours. Then, I decided to go to Java to take\
  \ a plane to my next destination. I crossed the island by car desiring to stay there\
  \ for a week more or even the rest of my life. \nAfter that, it was Thailand\u2019\
  s time! More than bathrooms with no toilets or many disgusting things like scorpions,\
  \ insects and spiders to eat, that place showed me their astonishing natural beauty.\
  \ Seriously, Maya Bay is impossible to describe and capture in a photography. Crowded,\
  \ noisy and lively: Thailand was a perfect balance between rest and fun.\nThe last\
  \ country was Cambodia that had enchanted me as soon as I arrived.  Chaotic traffic,\
  \ extreme poverty and the kindest people ever! They don\xB4t speak English but they\
  \ help you as they can. I did a spiritual retreat and for a week I meditate and\
  \ learned about energy and chakras. At the last day the retire girl\xB4s group went\
  \ to Angkor Temple to meditate and have a picnic. Amazing trip that metamorphosed\
  \ me for the rest of my life."
