Text: "At the end of 2006, Lillian, a Taiwanese friend I had met while traveling in\
  \ Sicily, invited me on a Dominican-Republic trip she had won. We would spend five\
  \ days in an all-inclusive resort.\nWe flew into Santo Domingo and hitched a ride\
  \ on a local minibus taxi for Punta Cana. Immediately, we knew that this would be\
  \ nothing like our excursions in Italy or our multi-country accidental reenactment\
  \ of Planes, Trains and Automobiles through Eastern Europe to Keszthely, Hungary.\
  \ The young man handling the passengers took my eggplant-colored Osprey backpack\
  \ and slung it onto his shoulders without securing the hipbelt. With the side door\
  \ of the overpacked minibus open, he rode outside the vehicle while clinging to\
  \ the inner edge of the roof with an underhand grip and leaned his torso away, as\
  \ we sped through muddy roads lined with palm and banana trees. We routinely passed\
  \ mopeds carrying three cramped passengers. I wondered about the logistics and safety\
  \ of it all while vowing to never attempt anything similar.\nArriving at our destination,\
  \ we checked into a sprawling resort not unlike the timeshares I had seen years\
  \ ago in Orlando, Florida. I attempted to revive the pitiable remnants of my college\
  \ Spanish while chatting at length with the bellhop, a slender, amiable man in his\
  \ 20s, and we somehow landed on the topic of dancing. This led to an invitation\
  \ to a local party that we gleefully accepted.\nA few nights later, the three of\
  \ us piled onto his small moped. As the highway stretched before us in the darkness,\
  \ we drove on and on without the hint of a destination. The New Yorker in me became\
  \ alarmed. I checked in with Lillian in Mandarin and asked if she thought we could\
  \ take our driver down if we had to, and she said, \u201Cyes.\u201D  As we drove\
  \ further, I mentally calculated the lengthening walk back to our hotel.\nFaint\
  \ dance music interrupted my brooding, as lights appeared far in the distance. As\
  \ we got closer, I saw that a large crowd had gathered at a gaseteria-cum-open-air-night\
  \ club. Feeling relieved, we occupied a white plastic table and took in the scene:\
  \ With gas pumps standing guard in the background, throngs of couples nimbly navigated\
  \ the concrete dance floor while those watching ordered drinks from their seats.\
  \ Our host and I chatted during the salsas and danced the bachatas and merengues\
  \ with some locals gawking.\nAfter a few hours, tired from the dancing but exhilarated\
  \ by this off-the-beaten-path experience, we drove again into the darkness."
