Text: "I am leaving Kashmir. 'The Switzerland of Asia', they call it: a far-away haven\
  \ of soulfoul scenery and world-renowned craftsmanship. I am riding in a giant shared\
  \ jeep with a bunch of Kashmiri men, which is the most convenient way to reach Jammu\
  \ from Srinagar. Srinagar is the summer capital, and Jammu is the winter capital\
  \ of the north-Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir: a region that rests under some\
  \ of the most majestic Himalayan peaks between Pakistan and China, and is home to\
  \ various ethnic groups, each with its own language and sense of identity. \nThere\
  \ is a certain protective halo around foreigners here. They fly in; spend a few\
  \ days trekking in the mountains with local guides; buy a bunch of stunning, handcrafted\
  \ Kashmiri shawls, carpets, papier mache furniture, and other textiles at exorbitant\
  \ prices, compared to other Indian states; and fly out, feeling blessed and grateful.\
  \ I went to see an apiarist, 'the honey lady', a local legend and 'ooold' apparently,\
  \ from whom Mick Jagger gets his cannabis honey and royal jelly. She is revered\
  \ locally because of her ties to foreigners. I basked in all the symbols of Kashmiri\
  \ culture: the kahwa chai made with almonds and rose oil; the traditional phiran\
  \ attire, a warm woolen gown; and an ember-filled wicker pot, called kangar, carried\
  \ underneath to keep warm. \n'Kashmiri people are good with their hands', said my\
  \ local friend and guide, with whom we rode a shikara, the famous Kashmiri boats,\
  \ around the Old Town, which is famously set on the waters of Dal Lake. I saw that.\
  \ Kashmiri people are born handcraftsmen, merchants and storytellers; they are knowledge\
  \ seekers and wisdom holders: they insisted on listening to music from where I come\
  \ from and hearing what the language sounds like, and enquired about economy and\
  \ societal values. As if I, the visitor, added to their library. \nKashmiri people\
  \ are proud and wordly. Their hands and minds are both tied by deep-running worship\
  \ of beauty. You can find it everywhere, even in the way they landscape their parks\
  \ and gardens in Srinagar: there is symmetry, there are graceful patterns, richness\
  \ of species, reverence to the craft.  \nThe grandest pattern in Kashmir, though:\
  \ their night sky. An indigo-hued vastness gilded with millions of stars.\nI would\
  \ have visited only for that Kashmiri night sky, a vault of heaven that felt like\
  \ a burst of intimacy. \nNow, I am leaving, and this shared tolerance among strangers\
  \ on the road feels like a farewell gift from the land."
