Text: "When I was a 16-year-old young girl I won an scholarship to go to Germany.\
  \ I sudied at Col\xE9gio de Aplica\xE7\xE3o, an school that is related to the Federal\
  \ University of Rio Grande do Sul, and then, in 2009, the school signed a partnership\
  \ with Goethe Institut, it was called \"Schulen: Partner der Zukunft\" (that means\
  \ \"Students: A partnership to the future\"). We were supposed to write an essay\
  \ telling why we should be selected to this scholarship, and I won the first place\
  \ to a short german course of three weeks in Heidelberg - DE.\nIt was a big surprise\
  \ and joyness, because I could not even go to my town's downtown alone, and then.....\
  \ I would go to Germany all by myself!!!! This was my greatest and most valuable\
  \ experience ever! Was my first and only time abroad, and, since I just love german\
  \ culture and travelling is my passion, I was extremely happy and satisfied with\
  \ myself!\nWhen I got there, I remember feeling really lonely: I barely knew speaking\
  \ german, and I also have not know anyone. It was really frightening at first, the\
  \ two first days I was really really scarying and I almost wanted to go back home,\
  \ to my mom and dogs, but... I was making a dream come true, could not let my insecurities\
  \ influence in my biggest dream. So, I calmed down, took a deep breath and decided\
  \ to let all the new experiences and feelings in! It was the best decision in my\
  \ life ever.\nWhen I got back my country and hometown, I was a completely different\
  \ girl: more comprehensive with differences, more tolerating with people and situations\
  \ and, mainly: absolutely in love with travelling and new experiences!"
