Text: "The three other passengers in the car had sunk into silent thoughts. I lean\
  \ back in my seat and gaze at the sunny countryside passing by. It's an unusually\
  \ sunny November day.\n\nOnly 3 days ago I discovered that my 'more or less 2.5\
  \ years' of hitchhiking around the world were going to be exactly 777 days. My lucky\
  \ number! \"What a coincidence\" I think. Is it?\n\nToday is that day. Only 20 minutes\
  \ ago I hitched this ride in Berlin for the last part of my journey. \"This evening\
  \ I'm back home! I finished my world tour!\", it shoots through my mind with a sense\
  \ of disbelief and excitement. A smile on my face.\n\n2.5 years ago, I was a successful\
  \ manager at a big multinational. I was a science loving agnostic with a fixed worldview.\
  \ Still, something was missing in my life. That's why I had decided to travel and\
  \ find my life purpose.\n\nNow sitting in the car, I pull out my eBook, hoping to\
  \ make good use of the 7 hours that lie in front of me. Scrolling through the list\
  \ of books I come across The Alchemist. A book I read in my youth and completely\
  \ disliked. It's 'too spiritual' for a science guy.\n\nSince the countryside is\
  \ not getting any more interesting though, I give it a shot. With a deep sigh I\
  \ turn to the first page. As the hero proceeds through the pages, I immediately\
  \ feel how the book describes my journey. \"What a coincidence\" I think. Is it?\n\
  \nI devour the pages with growing eyes and amazement. This book is describing my\
  \ journey. The recurring dreams that pushed me to leave my home. Getting tricked\
  \ by a fraud who left me penniless in the midst of nowhere. Strangers that helped\
  \ me in my worst hour. The visions I saw while living with the shamans. It feels\
  \ as if this book was written for me.\n\nAs I keep reading, my throat keeps tightening.\
  \ The letters get blurry. Every now and then I turn my face towards the window and\
  \ pretend I'm looking outside, so I can wipe off my tears without the person sitting\
  \ next to me noticing it.\n\nBy the time the hero is captured in the desert and\
  \ meets God to ask for help, the lump in my throat is close to bursting. The tears\
  \ welling up prevent me from reading further. My whole body is trembling.\n\n I\
  \ am confused. How is it possible that a book that I read and disliked before, could\
  \ change so much since the first time I read it?\n\nThat moment it dawns on me.\
  \ The tears are streaming down my face. It is the moment I realize, that it isn't\
  \ the book that changed, but me.\n\nNovember 5, 2016\nModified from my notes"
