Text: "The sign in front of the bar read \"Lo Que Pasa Aqui Se Queda Aqui Tranquilo\"\
  \ translation: \"What happens here stays quiet here\". And after only knowing the\
  \ stranger for a week I trusted him and I put it in my mouth.\n \n Earlier in the\
  \ day at 'Rancho Sol Y Mar', an off grid sustainable ranch hidden in the lush hillsides\
  \ of Jalisco, Mexico I was melting under the high noon sun. Giant beads of sweat\
  \ were rolling down my pale freckled skin. When Sam, one of the ranch volunteers,\
  \ approached me and told me a rumour that in the nearby seaside cliffs there were\
  \ snails whose defense secretions could be used to dye one's hair purple. I was\
  \ up for an adventure. Casually we strolled along with soft sand squishing between\
  \ our toes down a path framed by giant palms and fragrant floral bushes. \n\n We\
  \ arrived at the cliffs on 'Lover's Beach' -famous for its sunset views- towering\
  \ before us were giant rock structures riddled with glistening white quartz veins.\
  \ Vibrant green plants seemed to explode from the cracks. Scaling up and down steep\
  \ jagged slopes, we paused on a peak overlooking a cove where 18ft swells were violently\
  \ crashing. Sam pointed to the water and said \"The snails are clinging to the rocks\
  \ just under the water line below us.\" My legs turned to jelly as we descended\
  \ the slippery rock face; it felt as if my heart was pounding harder than the waves.\
  \ We quickly gathered the snails and scurried back up to safety. As we perched upon\
  \ the peak we looked across the expanse of the ocean and felt at peace. I thought\
  \ the moment couldn't become more perfect when a massive mammal breached the horizon\
  \ like the first spring flower emerging from a snowy grave. An ethereal tranquility\
  \ washed over me as I gazed upon a whale for the very first time. So humbling. We\
  \ decided to celebrate the day with libations at 'EL Rinconcito', a funky beach\
  \ bar and supplier of Raicialla -an agave based spirit. \n\n We applied the snail\
  \ secretions to our hair transforming it to a vibrant violet. Sam surprised us with\
  \ something he had discovered on our hunt. He found what locals call sea cockroaches\
  \ -a reticulated hard shelled creature with a soft fleshy under belly- He told us\
  \ to eat them, raw! I have a passion for avant-garde cuisine, but this was progressive.\
  \ I placed my trust in my new friend, and with a squeeze of lime I slurped back\
  \ the insides. It was surprisingly tasty. Placing your faith in others can lead\
  \ to life's most spontaneous and memorable experiences. Vive por el momento."
