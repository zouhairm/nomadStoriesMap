Text: "I muffle a cough and wave the toxic fumes and dust away from my face. The bus\
  \ thumps away, bucking and groaning down the seemingly endless road. Squinting through\
  \ the haze, I look around.\n\nDeserted. \n\nA flat, arid landscape stretches for\
  \ miles in every direction, interrupted in the distance by jagged limestone karsts\
  \ - nothing like the lush jungles and emerald rolling hills I had experienced in\
  \ other parts of Laos. \n\nPeeling off the highway, a dirt path framed by parched\
  \ fields disappears into a patch of low, bushy trees. The only other indication\
  \ of civilization is a hand-painted sign with the words \"Guesthouse - 3km\" accompanied\
  \ by an arrow pointing down the ominous road. \n\nI don my two backpacks, wincing\
  \ as the weight pulls at my stiffened muscles. The sun is beginning to set, and\
  \ the dust has returned to the ground. I commence, thinking ironically that after\
  \ months of feeling disconnected from everything I've known, I've now traveled all\
  \ this way to literally be in the middle of nowhere. It's been a mere three weeks\
  \ since the U.S. inaugurated our new president, and I've never seen my country more\
  \ divided. The disunity exposed by the election has consumed my mind during this\
  \ solo trip. As I walk laboriously down the vacant road, I feel the heaviness of\
  \ a broken nation burn into my shoulders.  \n\nThe sky darkens, and I begin to question\
  \ how much further I can drudge on. With my eyes fixated on the ground in front\
  \ of me, a familiar aroma wafts into my nostrils. I look up to see the glow of flames\
  \ flickering through branches obstructing my view. Gradually the sounds of chickens\
  \ and giggling children mingle with music that floats out of a bamboo hut. I approach\
  \ the village cautiously, suddenly ashamed by my brazen intrusion as a foreigner.\
  \ I glance sideways at children playing soccer and women nursing infants while cooking\
  \ over an open fire. Men lay bricks or smoke pipes; a dog scampers past me with\
  \ a scrap of stolen meat - all of the activity seamlessly orchestrated and woven\
  \ together like timeless piece of art.\n\nAs my footsteps bring notice, everyone\
  \ smiles and waves, shouting greetings \"Sa-bai-Dee!\" and then carry on as if they've\
  \ simply been expecting me. My angst melts away with every welcoming gesture. My\
  \ steps grow lighter; burden replaced with a soothing sense of community after days\
  \ and weeks of desperate isolation. \"Sa-bai-Dee!\" I respond, smiling at the notion:\
  \ what I thought was the middle of nowhere turned out to be the center of everything."
