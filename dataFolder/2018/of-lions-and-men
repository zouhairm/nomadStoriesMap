Text: "The three of us stood by our whitewater kayaks on a flat-topped boulder beside\
  \ the Rio Azul in Chile. The blood was getting washed from Eric\u2019s forehead\
  \ into red puddles by our feet. We had a decision to make. \n It was raining in\
  \ Northern Patagonia carrying snowmelt fast downhill from the steep mountains around\
  \ us.  The Futaleufu River, which we had intended to paddle, had risen 4 feet overnight.\
  \  This had sent us up the gravel road higher into the jungle- when river valleys\
  \ flood, smaller tributaries and dry creeks become runnable at elevations above.\
  \  \nThe Azul had been beautiful up until this moment.  It runs through a narrow\
  \ slot canyon bursting with emerald plants and mosses on every surface, waterfalls\
  \ falling in from either side.  The river was \u201Cpool drop\u201D in character.\
  \ We would come around a bend, paddle through rapids or over a small waterfall into\
  \ a pool, repeat. As we rounded the last bend however, the character of the river\
  \ changed. It became a steep maze of jagged rocks which looked like shark fins in\
  \ the boils of water.  I flipped upside down after going over a waterfall. Eric,\
  \ close behind me, had bounced his boat off my overturned hull. He had been redirected,\
  \ head first, into the point of a jagged rock. It cut 6 inches sideways across his\
  \ forehead-under the lid of his helmet and down to the bone. \n \u201CWe\u2019ve\
  \ got two options: One, we hike out with our boats from here, up the wall of the\
  \ gorge and try and catch a game trail to a road.  Option two, we finish running\
  \ the Azul down to the Futa .\u201D I put forward. \nWe were camped in tents at\
  \ the bottom of the Azul at its confluence with the Futaleufu. The road was sparsely\
  \ trafficked.  The only shelter we had seen driving up the expansive valley was\
  \ a small plane which had crashed high on a mountainside. An enterprising local\
  \ had stretched a tarp across from the cabin to the wing.  \n\u201CThere are mountain\
  \ lions here and he is bleeding like crazy.\u201D I said, with some urgency.\n\u201C\
  How does it look? Eric asked \nScott and I both scanned it and nodded to assure\
  \ him it looked alright.  It didn\u2019t look anything like alright. \n \u201DThey\
  \ can\u2019t swim can they?\u201D Eric asked \n\u201CI don\u2019t think so.\u201D\
  \ Scott assured him.\n We were adjacent what is now Pumalin Park, a National Park\
  \ of Chile, \u201CPumalin\u201D meaning mountain lion.  Puma Concolor is the same\
  \ species of mountain lion found from the Yukon to Argentina. On the banks of the\
  \ river we were as safe as bleating goats.\n We decided to take our chances with\
  \ the river"
