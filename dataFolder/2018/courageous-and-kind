Text: "It\u2019s 2002. The world is still reeling. I'm set to see my friend in Tunisia,\
  \ when Al-Qaeda drives a truck packed with explosives into El Ghriba, long a symbol\
  \ of Jewish Muslim coexistence.\n\nI was at that synagogue years ago; signed my\
  \ name in its book. Djerba\u2019s reputed to be the Land of the Lotus Eaters, and\
  \ I can see why: Bougainvillea petals carpet courtyards of blue and white tile.\
  \ Floral scents soak sea air. Like Odysseus and his besotted men, I was loathe to\
  \ leave.  \n\nBut now there are bodies, blasted and charred, and my circle is scared\
  \ for me. I soothe most, but my mother\u2019s fear tugs. \n\nMy parents were content\
  \ to stay in the land to which their parents fled. With no need for passports, it\
  \ was no surprise my mother would ask, \n\"Will they know you're Jewish?\" \"No,\
  \ Ma. They won't. Religion's not on our passports.\u201D\n\"Will someone ask you\
  \ at the airport?\"\n\"No, Ma. They won't. Please don't worry.\"\n\nI don't regret\
  \ not going then. It was a decision born of kindness to a woman married fifty years\
  \ to a man who\u2019d endured taunts of \"Sammy the Jew Boy\u201D in his Brooklyn\
  \ neighborhood. Who\u2019d lost her brother to Nazis. My war-weary mother had lived\
  \ to see a new century, but still saw nothing new. When I saw my trip through her\
  \ eyes, I simply couldn\u2019t go.\n\nTime has passed and my mother has too. Terror\
  \ will not keep me home. I believe that in her spirit soul, Gertie thrills at all\
  \ I\u2019ve seen: The sphinx shrouded by a sandstorm so wild we had to flee. Hidden\
  \ villages in Nicaragua, where witches purportedly live. The herd of Cambodian water\
  \ buffalo our bike bisects, spiky horns just inches from me.\n\nShe giggles as I\
  \ bounce over dunes in an old army truck to reach Cabo Polonio, the end of the earth.\
  \ We have scrumptious shrimp and a why-the-hell-not second Tannat. We stumble back\
  \ to our candle-lit shelter over a rocky promontory and sense horses beyond a cone\
  \ of dim light tossed into the night. Ma would approve of my flashlight; she\u2019\
  s less sanguine that sea spray mists us in our bed. \n\nI cling to my man as he\
  \ steers us back to Punta del Este along the shimmering sea. I miss my grandkids\
  \ and conjure adventures for us: NYC\u2019s Highline; world-away Amsterdam, where\
  \ we\u2019re snug in a houseboat with windows so high, we spy the funny lopped-off\
  \ legs of passersby.\n\nMuch of my mother lives in me, but not her timidity. Take\
  \ out insurance and leave an itinerary. But unless staying behind is the only option\
  \ to be kind, don\u2019t let fear derail your plans. Be courageous. Go."
