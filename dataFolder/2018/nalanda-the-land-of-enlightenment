Text: "\u201CWhen the western civilization was just a blooming bud, the Nalanda in\
  \ the east was the elightening source for the world with its knowledge and education\
  \ culture.\u201D This line from the guide bewildered my thoughts about the western\
  \ culture which I always considered to be the best. I was amazed and overwhelmed.\n\
  Sitting in the bus my thoughts wandered and I wondered how it will feel to visit\
  \ the first university of the world. Established in India, Nalanda  is in the state\
  \ Bihar. What I have always heard about Bihar and the cliched notions I was pretty\
  \ sure that it must be a small hut or temple like something. After reaching Nalanda,\
  \ I could sense the difference in the environment. It felt sacred and pious but\
  \ the small shops around were making me sure it was indeed very small place. After\
  \ walking on the path decorated with flowers on the both sides I saw a small gate\
  \ at some distance. \nI was surprised to know the fact from the guide's information\
  \ which broke all my pride and notions that this very small door was the first step\
  \ of the admission in the university. The pupil had to answer the gatekeepers to\
  \ enter the university who were so intelligent that most of the students failed\
  \ just at the first step.\nI was totally shocked after seeing the remains of the\
  \ university which were still so amazing and graceful that they still had the aura\
  \ of  the glorious past. I was forced to ponder how great it would be in its early\
  \ times. Everything was still in systematic way, the hostel, classrooms etc. Guide\
  \ told us about the facilities which students availed at the university. Everything\
  \ was free including education, food, clothes and medicines. The university got\
  \ 200 villages as a donation from where they got their food and money.  \nWhen the\
  \ whole world was drowning into the darkness, then this eastern  university illuminated\
  \ the lamp of knowledge for centuries. I was returning back leaving behind my inferiority\
  \ complex  and I had enlightened  my thoughts for the Nalanda university which made\
  \ me free of all my wrong  thoughts  about it.\nReally, it was the place of enlightenment."
