Text: "\u201CTravel! It will be fun,\u201D they said. \nI thought about this sarcastically\
  \ as I peered into the gaping maw of what had been a steel bridge just hours before.\
  \ The road behind us was washed out too. All that was left was a massive river churning\
  \ trees in its hellacious froth. \nPeople stood alongside the jagged edge of the\
  \ highway, drenched to the bone and yelling in Spanish. \nI was traveling with a\
  \ good friend, David. We were both desperate to make it back to San Jose and this\
  \ road was our only way. He had clinical rotations for medical school and I had\
  \ my flight back to the States. \n\u201CFive cars were swept away with the bridge!\u201D\
  \ David told me. He hurried to perform CPR on a gentleman lying in the grass. \n\
  As I idled where some other travelers had just died, I wondered if I might die too.\
  \ Hours drug by with suffocating graduality. The man lying in the grass managed\
  \ to stand up. The music on the radio dissolved into static; my eerie sense of being\
  \ cut off from the world grew. Bug bites erupted all over my body when I rolled\
  \ down the window. At times I tried to sleep, crunched in a bad position, my damp\
  \ rain jacket my blanket. At one point, I offered my only towel to a drenched pregnant\
  \ woman. \nJust a day before, I had been enjoying coconut shrimp at El Avion in\
  \ Manuel Antonio whilst observing monkeys and the placid ocean. Then we went kayaking\
  \ in Puerto Jimenez. Now I was stuck in a hurricane. The beautiful rain forest was\
  \ now a muddy mess. But I found beauty in the faces of the people around me. Remarkably,\
  \ even as their homes flooded, Costa Ricans managed to keep smiling. All the villagers\
  \ of Palo Seco assembled to make rice and plantains for everyone. It was the best\
  \ food I had ever tasted. \nBy 4 am, the water had lowered enough to allow passage\
  \ back to Quepos. David was exhausted and pale from a night of saving lives. His\
  \ arms hurt from giving compressions. \n\u201CYou\u2019re a hero.\u201D\nHe humbly\
  \ shrugged. \u201CNo ambulance could get to us, so it was up to us.\u201D\nHow wonderful\
  \ it felt to stretch my legs at a store in Quepos! We were blessed to find a room\
  \ for our last twenty colones. It felt odd being dry.   \nIn the morning, we observed\
  \ the damage. I felt grateful to be alive. Tragically, the storm had claimed five\
  \ lives the night before. \nTraveling is life-changing because it will give you\
  \ experiences you would never expect. Traveling will not only push you past your\
  \ comfort zone, it will shatter your boundaries and make you take leaps of faith\
  \ that you never even imagined."
