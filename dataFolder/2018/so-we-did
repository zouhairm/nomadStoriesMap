Text: "Well, I didn't expect anything and I tried to forget the assumptions I had.\
  \ The main source of previous information in my brain was Apocalypse now, and it\
  \ wasn\u2019t even actually filmed in Vietnam. Needless to say, I was definitely\
  \ ready. \n\nWhen three of my friends proposed the trip, it seemed like an impossible\
  \ dream, a place so different it was difficult to even imagine. I didn\u2019t really\
  \ think about it because I knew if I did I wouldn\u2019t have the balls to go, so\
  \ I agreed to go to this magical world only existing in movies.\n\nThe only thing\
  \ I planned for sure was the photography equipment I was bringing. And by equipment\
  \ I mean an old compact Lumix and two almost broken smartphones.  I was extremely\
  \ unprepared for all the other things. My friends did a sensible \u201Clet\u2019\
  s buy and bring everything just in case we encounter the apocalypse\u201D. I, on\
  \ the other hand, thought: \u201CI can use all the stuff I already have. Who needs\
  \ a gigantic backpack full of stuff from Decathlon?\u201D \n\nI did. As any sweaty-and-not-used-to-trekking-under-the-monsoon-in-sandals-and-terrified-of-cockroaches\
  \ person would. \n\nHowever, it was the most wonderful disaster. Planning is important\
  \ and good and necessary. But every time we felt that brief spark of absolute happiness,\
  \ it was when something unexpected happened. And we all four felt it. \n\nWe never\
  \ planned to get along so well. We were good friends, but we had never spent so\
  \ much time together, and everybody warned us about usual travelling conflicts.\
  \ We just clicked. We ended up being like family. We didn\u2019t expect that a certain\
  \ type of chilli soup was not acceptable for our Spanish-bred stomachs. We even\
  \ (and that was definitely not planned) had diarrhea together. We did not count\
  \ on driving a motorcycle (which we had learned how to drive that day) next to a\
  \ man with a magnificent eagle (a true, alive bird) in his head. We didn\u2019t\
  \ plan to learn more about people and kindness than ever. We did not anticipate\
  \ to understand how being considered different feels like. We never expected to\
  \ laugh more than ever in our entire lives. We never prepared for watching some\
  \ of the most beautiful natural landscapes we had ever seen. We didn\u2019t plan\
  \ to fall in love with Vietnam. \n\nSo we did."
