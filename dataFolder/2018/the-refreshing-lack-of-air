Text: "My maiden trip to Chail, Shimla was an awakening. I experienced something apart\
  \ from the endless plain terrains, pollution and the noise. The air was thin and\
  \ my ears felt like they were forced shut. I changed three buses to get there. The\
  \ way kept getting narrower and steeper. Bus drivers somehow maneuvered 180 degrees\
  \ perpendicular gradients and I kept estimating the height of the valleys and the\
  \ hills, as the bus dangled from the section of the road. \n\nWe lived in tents\
  \ with a toilet separated by a curtain. The tent was 100 square feet and contained\
  \ a bed and a sofa. Now, we were four guys, the sofa was always wet due to the leaking\
  \ rain. So, we four slept on the bed meant for two and in the night the rain splashed\
  \ all over face bursting through the partially zipped window. The thunder and rain\
  \ played like an orchestra through my ears. It was wildly irritating embedded between\
  \ four guys, with rain splashing all over my face but I was smiling through and\
  \ through. It was because I have lead a moderately comfortable life and being close\
  \ to the nature for the very first time made me happy. \n\nWe used to hike a four\
  \ kilometer steep unplanned hill to our site. Being civil engineering students,\
  \ we planned to survey and plot a map of the hill. The hike upwards was endearing,\
  \ without a break and mounting fast; we panted fully drained of energy and the junk\
  \ food and trans fat in the body attacked the liver, and the liver started to overwork,\
  \ burning the fat. We easily lost three four kgs over the hills and the lost weight\
  \ never came back. \n\nThe people who lived there moved across the hills at the\
  \ speed of light, we looked in wonder and they were so connected to the roots of\
  \ being a simple human. They had home grown vegetables and were majorly cut from\
  \ civilization. The sunlight used to be very intense, the trees on the hills many\
  \ times caught fire. Though we didn't know the reason. Our stay of one week comprised\
  \ of hiking adjoining hills, roaming around, along with the fear of prancing leopards,\
  \ the fear of slipping and falling into the deep cliff.  \n\nFrom a planned city\
  \ to a natural hill, my mind became lighter of the urgency of acquiring wealth and\
  \ perfection. I calmed down and relaxed for some time. I don't know if I have yet\
  \ again become my old self but I can't wait to go to my next trip."
