Text: "A friend in New Zealand invited me to study penguins. A week later I was on\
  \ my way! It was an arduous 3 day journey, but I got to Christchurch. I slept a\
  \ bit then walked to the bus stop to go to Kaikoura. I remembered my first time\
  \ there and how eerie it was in the after math of the 2011 earthquake. The last\
  \ thing I expected was to experience it myself.\n\nAfter a lovely day and evening\
  \ on the beach, I went to bed thankful. The building shook violently soon after\
  \ midnight. Furniture flew; plaster fell; glass shattered. I couldn\u2019t find\
  \ my phone or glasses. I stumbled into the hall yelling to get out as I shoved the\
  \ jammed door.\n\nWe piled in vans and drove up the mountain to avoid a tsunami.\
  \ Most of us were cold and without shoes. We tried to clean wounds. Aftershocks\
  \ came frequently. Listening blindly to landslides above us was terrifying. As the\
  \ stories unfolded, I was thankful we made it out alive.\n\nThe sunrise was gorgeous\
  \ and the fear lessened, but we had to face destruction. The tsunami warning lifted.\
  \ Driving down was harrowing. The cracks were huge and the buckling of the earth\
  \ unbelievable. When we returned, we discovered buildings were unsafe.\n\nWe gratefully\
  \ stayed at the church a pastor offered us. The days were long and full of aftershocks.\
  \ Many were displaced, but it was amazing to see how everyone joined together. Landslides\
  \ closed the roads. The ocean floor rose 1.5m, so getting boats in was difficult.\
  \ Parts of town didn\u2019t look too bad, but other parts were in shambles. Power\
  \ was restored, but water supplies were low.\n\nDays later, we stood with 750 others\
  \ to board a navy ship. We registered, saw medical staff, ate, and got a spot to\
  \ sit.  We were on the boat for 12 hours and dropped off in Christchurch.\n\nI helped\
  \ my friend get sorted and traveled the north island. It was not a carefree travel\
  \ experience but one laced with introspection. I was thankful that I was able to\
  \ grieve and empathize with those who lost their belongings, community, and housing.\
  \ Being able to comfort them brought redemption to other tragedies in my life. \
  \ \n\nI had planned on studying penguins. The last thing I expected was to be 30\
  \ miles from the epicenter of a 7.8 earthquake that would forever change me. I experienced\
  \ anger, but I\u2019m thankful for the personal growth I experienced. The experience\
  \ gave me new compassion for people in natural disasters and sympathy for war torn\
  \ areas and refugees. The thing I least expected was the thing that brought my travel\
  \ true meaning."
