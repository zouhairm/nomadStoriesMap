Text: "I came here because thought I\u2019d connected with someone, but hadn\u2019\
  t. In fact, there no maps here, so how could I have? Instead, I circle outwards,\
  \ building a map in my mind. \n\nOn the first night after class, we go for dinner,\
  \ a 100 metre motorcycle ride along dust road to the Thali Ashram. So I know that\
  \ place. On the second day, a lift into town finds me at the bakery, eating while\
  \ overlooking the banks of Mother Ganga. Her waters are a giant jewel intersecting\
  \ green and blue, coolly flowing. On her shores, there are winding roads, and paths,\
  \ trees, many cows, people. Lost, I edge my way back to class, awakening the arches\
  \ in my feet as I walk.\n \nIn the crush of the top floor studio, I sit in Virasana,\
  \ hero\u2019s pose, submitting to the ever-present ache in my right knee. On two\
  \ blocks, and supported with a strap, I can breathe in it. I write as much as I\
  \ can while the day flows past. Around is the smell of decay, paint bubbling on\
  \ the walls, a shadowing of black there as everything slowly grows. I twist a rope\
  \ and place it under my knee, trying to rest in Virasana.\n\nOn the third day, I\
  \ wend past chaiwallas to the juice bar by the river. We make notes from class,\
  \ nibbling on chiku, bready and sweet and as cloying as the air. We build the memory\
  \ of the class, the action in the body to express the pose, the counteraction to\
  \ balance it. I remember rolling my calves to the sides to sink deeper into Virasana,\
  \ and then folding into Ardho Muhka Virasanana, arms lengthening, fingers outstretched,\
  \ forehead flat, pressing into the mat. \n\nIn class, the gap between me and the\
  \ others grows. These strong practitioners, professional travellers, and me, barely\
  \ floating, shaking as I stretch. It is so bright here, in Yogaland. The azure of\
  \ the river, swish of saris over muddied feet, one mantra played over and over by\
  \ the CD seller. Who buys these CDs? \n\nOn the fourth day, I cross Ram Jhula, narrow\
  \ and suspended over the Ganga. I frame a photo with my hands. My new friend shows\
  \ me her room here; maybe I will move there. We take lunch, the sour crunch of carrot\
  \ pickle lingering in my mouth. \n\nI move instead to Parmarth Niketan, a dark room,\
  \ stripped back. A monkey grips the dim mesh framing the lone, small window and\
  \ peers through it at me. One weak light to illuminate, one power point to connect\
  \ with my normal. I retreat to the four corners of my mat, breathing. This now is\
  \ the thing that is most real.\n\nAll I find are these four corners. The only connection\
  \ I find is me."
