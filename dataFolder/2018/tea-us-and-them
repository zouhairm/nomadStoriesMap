Text: "They were expected to welcome us with tea. A cup or flavored infusion towards\
  \ the end of the day, after a climb in the mountains seemed like a good idea. And\
  \ yet, with almost every step taking me higher on a sandy path, another question\
  \ came to my mind. What could I expect? Was there a surprise waiting for me, after\
  \ a week in the company of this funny lot of women coming from different countries\
  \ and backgrounds, sharing nothing but love for Bulgarian folklore? How to make\
  \ a connection with them?\n They did welcome us with tea. Tea, velvet peaches, banitsa\
  \ with various fillings and patatnik with its smell of herbs and olive oil. Those\
  \ local dishes, simple and delicious, occupied a table laid in the veranda of the\
  \ only hilltop house. The whiteness of the underlying tablecloth, embroidered with\
  \ traditional patterns, reflected the sun, which was already starting to descend.\n\
  \ They were sitting around the table, and we joined them to have the tea and dishes\
  \ they\u2019d prepared. Thus we had dinner with native women of the village of Startsevo\
  \ in the Rhodope Mountains. As they spoke poor English, and we knew hardly any Bulgarian,\
  \ we mostly used the language of smiles, facial expressions and gestures. It was\
  \ easier than I\u2019d expected.\n They suggested we sing together. Equipped with\
  \ the printed lyrics, we could release the song with our new friends. However, it\
  \ was only when Krasi and Mitra were singing on their own that the vibration of\
  \ their open voices pervaded the space, soaring over the ranges of green, forested\
  \ gentle giants arranged in soft layers reaching the horizon. The mountains carefully\
  \ listened to another story of love and marriage.\n  Perhaps inspired by the song,\
  \ they brought a full outfit of the Rhodope bride and chose me to put it on! After\
  \ a while I was strolling on the grass, my feet in ornamented woollen shoes, a white\
  \ cotton skirt and checked apron swinging, and a striped golden dress shining in\
  \ the sunlight. I actually felt like a bride, not married to a man though, but to\
  \ my femininity, the women, all women in the world, and the tremendous mountains\
  \ witnessing my experience.\n Eventually we all put our feet on the ground, grabbed\
  \ each other\u2019s hands and, accompanied by accordion music, danced some of the\
  \ oldest traditional Bulgarian circle dances. In each horo we did we could feel\
  \ we were one body; every step in repeating sequences brought us closer together.\
  \ Different though we were, in this dance, on that warm summer afternoon, we were\
  \ truly united."
