Text: "When I was booking my flight to Germany way back in October, I was put off\
  \ by the high prices for flights to Frankfurt, in particular.  It seems there is\
  \ some type of collusion to raise prices exactly on the dates I had to fly to get\
  \ to a fabric show.\n \nNot wanting to pay the exorbitant fares, I decided to take\
  \ my chances with a new upstart airline called WOW, which is based in Iceland. Yes,\
  \ that IS the name!  I should have known better!  But I decided to take a chance\
  \ and book the flight, which stopped in Reykjavik.\n \nFlying to Germany was no\
  \ problem. The return, however, gave me an unexpected adventure.  Long story short,\
  \ me and several other weary travelers had to stay in Iceland for a night. After\
  \ missing all of our connecting flights, we were told to pick up our suitcases,\
  \ proceed to the service counter at the Reykjavik airport and were handed a voucher\
  \ for our youth hostel as well as one for food.  That was a bit alarming! There\
  \ wasn\u2019t even an opportunity to put up a protest.\n \nIt was evident that none\
  \ of us were going anywhere anytime soon so we all looked at each other, resigned\
  \ to our fate, and decided to make the most of it. Secretly, many of us had wished\
  \ that we could have spent at least a little time in this strange and beautiful\
  \ country.  Now are wishes were coming true!\n \nWe immediately split up into groups.\
  \ The young, seriously financially challenged travelers formed their own group.\
  \  They decided to hang out at the local pool hall. Those us of with \u201Cprofessions\u201D\
  , many of us show- goers, decided to rent a car and drive from our hotel to the\
  \ nearby Blue Lagoon, labeled as one of the 25 wonders of the world. \n \nIt turned\
  \ out to be an amazing experience and EXACTLY what the doctor ordered! The Blue\
  \ Lagoon was just as I had imagined, and was surprisingly mesmerizing at nighttime,\
  \ with the cold air on my head, a sea of stars above and a foggy mist floating on\
  \ the heated water.  It was also funny as well, with most people, from all over\
  \ the world sporting the special mud masks dripping from their faces looking like\
  \ Mrs. Doubtfire.\n \nI met some amazing people who\u2019s motto in life, like mine,\
  \ is Carpe Diem. We definitely seized the moment and experienced what many people\
  \ only dream about, albeit a little against our will initially! For those of us\
  \ \u2018stuck\u2019 in Iceland, we went with the flow, literally, and have some\
  \ great memories to show for it! Once in awhile, the universe gives us what we secretly\
  \ wish for and then some!"
