Text: It was at the age of 5, when I first picked my bags , wore my new shining pink
  shoes and went off to explore tge winds of Sikkim. Travelling to me is the receipe
  of freedom, mixed with a spoon of dare, and a pinch of risk, add an ounce of adventure,
  and my receipe is complete. I started travelling solo post leaving my home-town
  for higher education. The pain and the gain of travelling solo can never be explained
  in any form. It is that space when you realise that this world has shades of all
  colors. You step out from your safe haven , and step out in a world which may be
  extremely torturous but at the same time heavenly beautiful. I have travelled across
  my country , and have visited places and cultures that cannot be found on your local
  search engines. From the pristine beaches of Dhanushkodi, to the wild ,free, intense,
  and the unforgivable mountains of the Himalayas, from the winds of Shillong to the
  culturally rich states of South India, I have lived and witnessed it all. There
  is not more exhilarating than eating a sweet corn and an ice-cream near a sea shore
  or eating local chats and phuchkas from a roadside food hawker. I look forward to
  entering this scholarship program and chasing my passion. I also maintain a blog
  on tripoto.com and write for my fellow travellers. This would be a great opportunity
  to open my wings and fly higher in the deep blue sky .
