Text: "I am fully immersed in the morning chorus of the village as I press through\
  \ the market crowd. Letting the commotion carry me, I drift past rich colours and\
  \ aromatic fragrances, swollen fruits and beaded bracelets. As the crowd pushes\
  \ and pulls, I become distant from myself and observe my journey from afar. Bodies\
  \ begin to thin out as I come to the edge of the market. The waves of chaos gently\
  \ subside and I find myself in the shadows of the slaughterhouse. I just stand there.\
  \ In awe. A sensory explosion as the smell of decay leaves me besotted. For days\
  \ now, I have been in search for my reflection. And there it was - hanging limp\
  \ and etched into the Kenyan haze, half-skinned beasts with desperation frozen in\
  \ their eyes. I sit, engorged by the aura, listening as the scratch of vultures\
  \ emulate the loathing I have for this place. For myself. Unable to contain my emotions,\
  \ I weep. \nMy personal mirror, the slaughterhouse becomes my shrine. Emotionally\
  \ trapped in this small village, I could not resume my journey. Passionately, I\
  \ had boarded the plane with the dream of trekking Africa, yet I was stuck in this\
  \ town. I had hit a wall. I had lost my path. I had lost my self. Questioning my\
  \ motives, my life, my home, a deep-set crisis had set in. I felt sick to the core.\
  \ Yet the slaughterhouse let me breath. Brooding breaths, yet breaths nonetheless.\
  \ \nI begin to return daily to the Slaughter-shrine. I just sit and brood, infatuated\
  \ by the disparity of the scene. The bloodied mirror reflects my spirit, yet still\
  \ I can\u2019t leave. I am drunk on the sacrament of purpose. The butchery of life.\
  \ Days pass, and still I return, still unable to compose myself to continue my journey.\
  \  Yet when I return on this particular Tuesday it is different. I am not alone.\
  \ There is a young boy in red shorts just standing there. I sit, ignoring him, yet\
  \ he comes over and joins me. Not saying a word to one another, we watch the carcases\
  \ gently sway. Minutes pass with no words spoken. Then he jumps up and clasps my\
  \ hands. I feel cool metal in my palm. Still clasping my hand, he stares me in the\
  \ eye smiling, then runs off. I watch him stunned, then I look down, unfolding my\
  \ hand. A bright yellow toy car just sits there. I watch the red shorts disappear\
  \ into the market throng and I laugh. The compassion of a young boy has just saved\
  \ my soul. I don\u2019t wait another moment.\nI bound down the red track on the\
  \ back of a clapped-out Honda, dust covered and alive."
