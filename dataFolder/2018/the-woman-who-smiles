Text: "The alarm goes off at 6am. I wake up, still half asleep, sit up in my bed and\
  \ try to remember where I am and why I have to get up so early. After a few yawns\
  \ and stretches, I realize that I am in Kazakhstan and I spontaneously decided to\
  \ take a trip to Karaganda the night before. Getting to the train station seemed\
  \ like the whole day was going to be a disaster, as the taxi ride there took about\
  \ an hour. Entering the station I make a run for it, without knowing where to go.\
  \ Fortunately, I get on the right train, an old Soviet night train, with small bunk\
  \ beds and chipped wooden tables. Looking for my seat, I see it's been taken by\
  \ a young girl who is already sleeping, I feel bad waking her up, so I just sit\
  \ across from a 70 year old woman. \n\nAs the five hour journey begins, I make an\
  \ attempt to fall asleep. Of course, the beds are taken so I sit in the normal seats\
  \ and try to find a semi- comfortable position to sleep in. This task made out to\
  \ be impossible. As I try to entertain myself instead, the old woman positions herself\
  \ so she is across from me, leans forward and asks something in Kazakh. I apologize\
  \ and explain in Russian that I don't speak Kazakh. A bit confused and slightly\
  \ surprised, she smiles and begins to question me in her poor Russian. \"Where are\
  \ you from?\" Why are you in Kazakhstan?\" I answered all of her questions, trying\
  \ to satisfy her curiosity, thinking that she is just an innocent and lonely old\
  \ woman. Nevertheless, what happened next surprised me. \n\n\"I have 5 kids and\
  \ 7 grandchildren and they are really smart. One moved to America, like you and\
  \ she taught me how to say some words.\" At this point, I can't help but smile and\
  \ ask her what she knows. With the greatest joy, she starts making attempts at saying\
  \ 'sorry' , 'please', 'thank you' and 'very nice'. I congratulate her thinking that\
  \ our conversation has come to an end. Once again, I was wrong. She pulls out a\
  \ pirozhka and hands it over, while encouraging me with hand gestures to eat. I\
  \ do so while smiling back at her. \n\nI have no idea when I have to get off, so\
  \ I ask her \"Karaganda?\" she shakes her head and laughs. I give her a confused\
  \ look and she responds \"here in Kazakhstan we share, we talk and make connections.\
  \ When we can't, we use our eyes and smile, that's all you need.\" Two minutes later\
  \ she looks at me and says \"Karaganda\". I give her a big hug as I get off. Without\
  \ even knowing each other's name we were able to truly connect, you know, using\
  \ the eyes and smiling."
