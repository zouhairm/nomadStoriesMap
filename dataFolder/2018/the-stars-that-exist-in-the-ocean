Text: "I have been on one other cruise beside this one, and the only similarity between\
  \ the two was that they were indeed on cruise ships. The first cruise was a Caribbean\
  \ Cruise; the ship was bigger, and there were at least 15x as many people. Everything\
  \ about my first cruise was flashy and exciting. I was 15, and I felt like a distinguished\
  \ woman of the 1920s walking around endless decks; feeling the breeze of the open\
  \ ocean, but not so familiar with it that I could actually feel separated from land.\
  \ I had endless virgin strawberry daiquiris. Before dinner each night my family\
  \ would meet for a show at the theater. It was mostly comedy acts, but with my daiquiri\
  \ in hand I could pretend I was a sophisticated young lady becoming more and more\
  \ cultured as the show went on.\nThe cruise I was about to be on made me feel big.\
  \ I was 1 of 3 younger adults on board including my boyfriend and his sister. I\
  \ automatically felt grand, but not in my flashy cabaret 15-year-old way. My being\
  \ grand came from how much I was noticed. \nI thought nothing in the world could\
  \ make me feel small on this cruise ship until one night when I ventured to the\
  \ front of the boat. \nThe front of the boat couldn't have been more than 30 ft\
  \ from the surface of the ocean. It was dark on the cruise ship so you could see\
  \ the entire galaxy if you looked up. I walked to the edge of the cruise ship, and\
  \ as I was looking up admiring all the stars, something below caught my eye. A light\
  \ in the water had snatched my attention away from all the lights in the sky. There\
  \ was an unmistakeable grouping of light that had taken the form of a school of\
  \ fish swimming below me at the stern of the boat. Off farther to the right I saw\
  \ what couldn't have been anything other than a turtle made of tiny bioluminescent\
  \ lights. Suddenly there were dolphins too. I had turned to look off to the left\
  \ to follow another school of fish and a huge shining figure that took the shape\
  \ of a whale lit up the water. My heart flipped so fast I let out a giggle. I held\
  \ on to the side railing with all my might, and started laughing out loud watching\
  \ all the plankton light up the sea creatures below the surface. Never in my life\
  \ have I felt smaller than I did that night on the tiniest cruise ship in the world."
