Text: "Through the minivans I see what Hany, hours earlier, had referred to. Not that\
  \ he spoke with pride. So many here speak with pride when they remind you that,\
  \ of all the cities on earth, theirs is growing the most rapidly. No, Hany is too\
  \ widely driven to be misled by the numbers. Because that is what it takes to know\
  \ Cairo\u2014getting behind the wheel of a car and navigating the cage of gridlock\
  \ and the doubling of the price of almost everything since the new President took\
  \ office. Ask Hany. He\u2019ll tell you. He won\u2019t stop telling you what he\
  \ has seen. And what you are about to. \n\nI see the second set of structures that\
  \ Giza is famed for. Unfinished unit blocks; numbered and adorned on their lower\
  \ levels while sawtooth rows of unroofed scaffolding at their tops. \u2018This is\
  \ tax evasion,\u2019 laughs Hany, \u2018when you got nothing to sign.\u2019 \n\n\
  He beeps at a bike as it sluices through, explaining that once a tower is fully\
  \ built, its tenants are obliged to pay taxes. \u2018So,\u2019 he continues, \u2018\
  they are never finish. First generation on the ground, their children on the first\
  \ level and so on, something like that. No stop, no end.\u2019 In a city of millions\
  \ at night and millions more in the day, I would have thought the priority would\
  \ be to complete as many buildings as possible. There are, according to Hany, no\
  \ priorities. \n\nHany is a big man. His face sweats before the rest of his bulky\
  \ body because it is that much closer to the sun. Despite his size, he shakes your\
  \ hand as if picking up and dusting off the softness that his city dropped long\
  \ ago. Every gesture and word is a breath. A confident calm. A sharp eye, which\
  \ does not waver as Cairo\u2019s horizons do. And a week ago he was a stranger.\n\
  \nTonight Hany says he\u2019s going to see wise old Sultan Faraj and asks if I\u2019\
  d like to join him. On the way we pass shrieks of \u201Cbaladiyah!\u201D and the\
  \ clamour of unlicensed shisha bars packing up plastic chairs, and the fur-muffled\
  \ jangle of goats on goats, the necks of whom are marked with red circles. Whether\
  \ Eid or otherwise, something is always coming.\n\nWe leave that gas aurora, all\
  \ the minaret green, and come to an unlit mosque of seven hundred years with a courtyard\
  \ where the four Sunni schools of thought meet, or were meant to. \n\nThe sultan\
  \ is a mosque, and he\u2019s been abandoned.  \n\nInside, my last few days catch\
  \ up with me. I stand in the dim of the corridor and watch as Hany lets his eyes\
  \ shut, and lets himself onto the carpet. A man praying at a bare wall, seeing everything."
