Text: "Tokyo surprised me three times: first by 7/11 candy, surprisingly sweet despite\
  \ unconventional flavor; then by how many passengers can still squeeze into a crowded\
  \ train. Lastly by its state of organized chaos, a panic attack and an intoxicated\
  \ stranger \u2013 certainly the most confusing of the three.\nThe world\u2019s most\
  \ populated city relies on flow without timely disruption. But in ignorance to its\
  \ inner workings, I found myself stuck in the middle of its rush. I was lost, disoriented\
  \ by neon, flashing blindingly atop multicolored billboards. Arcade machines formed\
  \ an 8-bit orchestra, spilling dissonance with piercing intensity. The scents of\
  \ pork broth competed with raw fish, individual appeal lost in their unity; and\
  \ with the sensory overload, between towering skyscrapers and perpetual foot traffic,\
  \ anxiety rushed in and took over me.\nAccidental bumps and dismissive judgment\
  \ told me I was a problem \u2013 but every path was unknown, every alleyway daunting,\
  \ and panic bound me to frightened stillness. Then came \u2018sumimasen\u2019 \u2013\
  \ an \u2018excuse me\u2019 from a stranger: a middle-aged businessman halted in\
  \ front of me. He swayed slightly, blinked slowly, sure signs of inebriation. In\
  \ my state I worried, as drunken encounters never ended well, so hurriedly I gave\
  \ way. But shockingly he began to babble, quickly in drunken Japanese, constant\
  \ as the tide of people that rushed past. I stared, apprehensive, the language barrier\
  \ running thick. There were no signs of stopping, or ways for me to communicate,\
  \ when suddenly, he let out an exhausted sigh.\n\u2018Wakarimasu ka?\u2019 he asked,\
  \ words slurred \u2013 the only comprehensible phrase. I replied quickly, \u2018\
  Iie\u2019: I had not understood. Not until then, at least.\nHis bemused expression\
  \ transformed, the irony dawning slowly. It started with a smile, continued with\
  \ a chuckle, and soon he was bent over in drunken hysterics. He clutched his stomach,\
  \ face turning redder, attracting strange looks from around \u2013 but without warning,\
  \ he suddenly took leave, and I watched as he disappeared into the tide.\nHis charming\
  \ laugh faded into Tokyo\u2019s clamor, and as soon as he had come, he was gone.\
  \ Again, I was alone, still confused, still frozen \u2013 but subconsciously, the\
  \ stress had gone.\nJapan had hit me with full force: confusing but gentle, pleasantly\
  \ different, an unexpected introduction to its mysteries. Despite its intensity,\
  \ whichever path I took, the city was harmlessly surprising \u2013 so, without the\
  \ anxiety, I took my first step knowing: Tokyo and I would be okay."
