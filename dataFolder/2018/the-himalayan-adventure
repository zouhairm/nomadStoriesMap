Text: "Ever been to Himalayan ranges of India during monsoon!\nIn a group of 20 people,\
  \ I went to Deoriatal trek in Uttarakhand state of India. Deoriatal is a beautiful\
  \ lake surrounded by snow covered mountains. It takes a journey of 19-20 hours from\
  \ Delhi to reach the base camp region of Deoriatal. We started at late night of\
  \ Day 1 and reached Rishikesh on our way which is also a popular yoga hub of India\
  \ in the morning of Day 2.\nThe road ahead had Ganges on one side and Shivalik range\
  \ of Himalayas on the other. We then reached a small city Devprayag where Alaknanda\
  \ river and Bhagirathi river converge together to form the mighty Ganges. \nFinally\
  \ we reached our destination in the eveningof day 2. We had tea and some muffins\
  \ at a local bakery. The small bakeries of Himalayan region serve amazing bread\
  \ and other bakery items. It was already 18:00 hours and we had to trek further\
  \ for around 5 kms to reach deoriatal and set our camps. We all had torches and\
  \ other equipment by which we could have managed in the dark, so we decided to trek\
  \ even if it was night. And no one knew that this decision is not going to be so\
  \ easy for any of us.\nFinally on day 2 late evening, we started our trek. Everyone\
  \ was excited since we were around 2000 meters above sea level and sun already started\
  \ to set among those green meadows. Suddenly it started raining heavily. We took\
  \ our umbrellas and raincoats out, covered our luggage with rain covers and somehow\
  \ managed to start our trek again. We asked our guide if can stop somewhere. He\
  \ told us that there is no accommodation in this jungle and also that we cannot\
  \ set up our tents here. Nevertheless, we kept our traveler spirits high and continued\
  \ our trek. And then mother nature lost its cool. A whole tree along with it's roots\
  \ fell indicating a landslide. The mountain started falling. The path got very slippery.\
  \ And now the moment came when we started cursing ourselves of why we came to this\
  \ trek. \nAll of us got extremely demotivated. And then someone shouted that \u201C\
  Guys if we all work as a team, nothing can touch us in this drill\u201D. And then,\
  \ followed by our guide, we held each other\u2019s hand and started taking baby\
  \ steps in a synchronized manner so that we do not fall or slip. I learned the importance\
  \ of team work in a literal sense. One wrong step by anyone could have got everyone\u2019\
  s life at risk. The rain got heavier but we still managed to reach the top. The\
  \ teamwork was successful and we reached the destination on day 2 night."
