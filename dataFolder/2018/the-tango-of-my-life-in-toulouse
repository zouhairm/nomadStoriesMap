Text: 'Being only 20 years old, life has put me in situations that I would never imagine
  I would be to.My french adventure begins like this: Two years ago my boyfriend with
  whom I was in a relationship for many years moved to France. I stayed in Albania
  because I had my school to finish.From a close relationship full of love,joy and
  desire to live life to the fullest we went to a long distance relationship. I know,
  a story as old as humankind.We decided to give our love a chance.This led to other
  decisions that I had to make in order to fight for what i loved.One of them was
  finding a job because I wanted to visit my boyfriend. After many difficulties I
  managed to buy my ticket and have some money with me.I did not find a ticket straight
  to Toulouse (the city where he lives). I had a transit of 16h in Rome.At the airport
  I saw a famous commercial with the question "And you,what would you do for love?".Well,
  I spent the night in an airport,alone,with little money,a broken phone and a book
  of Michel Houllebecq so I could catch the flight to France next morning.I had traveled
  before and visited different cities but this trip made me feel something else.It
  was not just a visit and a reunion with my boyfriend. This was a lifestyle. In two
  weeks there I lived the life that we had been speaking so much of. This was going
  to be our life when i moved there once and for all. I was not eager to see the statues
  or the city center, I wanted to know how much was the train ticket from this place
  to that or where did people do groceries.I mean, of course I visited the city but
  not with the eye of a tourist but with the eye of a new member of that city.I wanted
  to see the places no one was interested about, the shops where the cheapest clothes
  or books were sold, the restaurants where we could eat a quick lunch.The little
  detective Xhesina was in town.At the end of my staying there I realized that this
  had been the best trip of my entire life.The circumstances i was in changed my way
  of seeing things,the superficial sightseeing is no longer part of my life.Now i
  go deep down in the places i see and make a local connection.The three themes that
  the application has are in a way or another part of my story because this decision
  pushed me to the edge , it was the last thing i expected the feeling that gave to
  me and I made a local connection but I am choosing the last one as the more significant
  one because if I did not make it in that trip for sure I will do it in the future.'
