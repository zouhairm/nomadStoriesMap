Text: "There was a loud knock on the door. It was around 0435am in the morning. My\
  \ 0430 alarm had just gone and I was now awake but was procrastinating getting out\
  \ of bed. It was chilly and the bed was warm, the sheets soft and comfortable, no\
  \ one would want to leave such a vivid real-time dream streaming live.\nThe knocking\
  \ continued and now grew to banging. I resorted to ignore it again as I knew exactly\
  \ who was at the door and the exact business that the person wanted. \n        \
  \                                                                   .......\n\u201C\
  Remember to put the money in a safe pocket\u201D, it was my mother reprimanding\
  \ me again. \n\u201COkay mom I will be very careful\u201D, I assured her. I took\
  \ the money she had given me the previous night and separated it into two.  I took\
  \ the bus fare money stuffed it in the right chest pocket and the remainder of the\
  \ money meant for food and transport to my brother\u2019s house once I arrived to\
  \ the city, I placed it on the left chest pocket of the shirt I wore. This way I\
  \ could always touch my chest and feel and confirm that the money was still there.\
  \ Mom had instilled great fear in me that where I was going there were great cunning\
  \ thieves who could steal from you without you feeling it, only to discover your\
  \ loss minutes or hours after they had gone.The journey to Harare was long but exciting\
  \ as it was my first time and the fact that I was travelling alone to the largest\
  \ and busiest city in Zimbabwe. It took about five hours from Mutare. I was seated\
  \ next to the window. I always liked this view from a moving vehicle and whenever\
  \ I boarded a bus I always set on a seat next to a window. The bus took us to Mbare\
  \ Musika market. There was a hive of activity, people jostling in all directions\
  \ like ants on an anthill, some were carrying abnormal loads of fresh market, on\
  \ their head and shouting at the top of their voices to attract customers. \nMy\
  \ heart pounded erratically as I disembarked form the safe haven of the bus to mingle\
  \ with the noisy unpredictable crowd. I clutched tightly on the satchel strapped\
  \ on my back with one hand the other fondling my chest pockets now and then, anticipating\
  \ the worst calculated criminal attack at any instance. I paced swiftly and confidently\
  \ out of the crowd and touts who offered hired assistance and were asking for my\
  \ destination. I had no idea of where I was going but I kept on walking. I approached\
  \ an elderly woman who was selling an assortment of fresh fruits from bananas, oranges,\
  \ pine apples"
