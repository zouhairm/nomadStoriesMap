Text: "The flight from Stockholm to Reykjavik sporadically seemed surreal. I was glued\
  \ to the little window of the plane that filmed the vistas of the extraordinary\
  \ volcanic marvel. We rented a car and were advised to be very careful with Icelandic\
  \ roads as they are eerily unpredictable. \nWe headed west on Ring Road. Our Airbnb\
  \ house was in Vestmannaeyjar also known as The Westman Islands. It was a half-an-hour\
  \ ferry ride from Landeyjahofn which is around 73 km from Vik. The sidereal sky\
  \ and the soporific swaying of the ferry had an intense but mellifluous effect on\
  \ my soul. We spent the night cooking and dining under the most expressive sky-lit\
  \ canopy at a nearby hill.\nNext morning, we set off towards Reynisfjara black beach\
  \ and Jokulsalron glacier. Sipping on hot chocolate at the beach caf\xE9 and devouring\
  \ the marvellous contours of the basalt formations stirred me. Exactly at that moment,\
  \ I had no grief, desire or regret. \nMy mind lay bare imbibing the novelty as we\
  \ drove 200 kms. Wondrous mountains were patched up with lazy moss and curious ponies.\
  \ After reaching the lap of an ordinary mountain slope, our gregarious nature induced\
  \ us to follow the small mass of people climbing up. Once we reached the edge, we\
  \ saw the mirror. The glacier had left traces like flowers strewn as offerings in\
  \ the form of ice-chunks on a crystal clear pool merging with the ocean. We frisked,\
  \ screamed and splashed like crazy kids who found out that their parents owned \u2018\
  Disneyland\u2019! We forgot the chill and unwound there in peace.\nThe time-keeper\
  \ forgot about time. Rushing to our cars, we gradually started driving at 180 kmph\
  \ to catch the last ferry at 10:30pm. Voila! Our car CRASHED! I was numb for a while.\
  \ I arranged myself to find out that everyone was stable. After regaining decorum\
  \ we extracted a comic element out of the incident, making fun of how we were warbling\
  \ \u2018Heaven! Heaven!\u2019 and nature gave us a glimpse of the real deal! \u2018\
  Be careful what you wish for\u2019 \u2013 I whispered.\nDejected and amused at the\
  \ same time we parked at the nearest petrol pump. I desperately tried to cover the\
  \ shattered window of our VW Caddy but to no avail. Suddenly one of us shouted \u2018\
  NORTHERN LIGHTS!\u2019 No sooner the bugle call than we ran to the nearest spot\
  \ underneath the night sky! The orchestra flooded its inception with the most marvelous\
  \ exhibit. We basked in wonder, gazing at the green, incredible Aurora Borealis,\
  \ cheering and slowly receding into thoughts of serendipity and perpetual happiness."
