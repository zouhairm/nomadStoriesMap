Text: "Francis, 7 years old, squats down onto the concrete pavement, his sandals nearly\
  \ torn off and clothes well worn. His 5 friends crowded tightly around him in a\
  \ row, side by side, in the same position. Their small scrawny faces were trying\
  \ to look smug but they were all hiding behind overjoyed excitement. \n\nFrancis\
  \ yells the count down loudly: \u201Ctatlo, dalawa, isa!\u201D. \n\nSimultaneously,\
  \ they all cup their hands together almost like a prayer, raise their arms high\
  \ to the sky, and with brute force, slam their hands down onto the concrete. \n\n\
  The race had begun. \n\nThey did this action continuously, swiftly, and with no\
  \ elegance at all; crouching forward each time. They were all scrambling forward\
  \ in a frenzied chaos but you could hear their hearty laughter from a mile away.\
  \ The other small children on the sidelines were cheering the competitors on. Pushing,\
  \ on their tiptoes, and leaning over each other to see better. \n\nNot even a minute\
  \ later, Francis shoots his fists up in victory, huge grin on his face. He does\
  \ a fleeting 5-second victory dance before high fiving his opponents. \n\nHis five\
  \ challengers each passed Francis something from their hands. They exchanged a quick\
  \ nod and their smug smiles returned to their faces instantly for another race.\
  \ They eagerly ran back to the starting line. \n\nI scurried over and joined the\
  \ crowd to watch up close. Intrigued to understand this strange game, where children\
  \ were repeatedly thrashing the concrete pavement with their dainty little hands\
  \ \u2013 with such overwhelming joy. \n\nThey each had a colored elastic rubber\
  \ band in front of them. They were cupping their hands in this strategic technique\
  \ that when they smash their hands onto the concrete, air flows through their hands\
  \ and makes the rubber band jump ahead. Whoever wins, gets to keep the opponents\u2019\
  \ rubber band. \n\nThe simplest of resources, with the most creative minds and innocent\
  \ hearts, produced such pure happiness.\n\nI never would have guessed that almost\
  \ exactly a year ago this country was hit by typhoon Haiyan Yolanda, one of the\
  \ strongest tropical cyclones ever recorded, with winds higher and stronger than\
  \ hurricane Katrina and hurricane Sandy, combined. \n\nThese kids at Dalingding\
  \ Sur Elementary School in Medellin, Cebu, Philippines, had nothing more than the\
  \ clothes on their backs and their precious elastic bands, and they have taught\
  \ me one of my life\u2019s biggest lessons: to be grateful for everything and everyone\
  \ I have in my life."
