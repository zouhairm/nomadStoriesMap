Text: "An unplanned trip to a planned destination in a different country may sound\
  \ strange, but trust me it was worth a shot! One thing that rapidly becomes apparent\
  \ when you arrive in this country, is that it is no Shangri-La.Bhutan captures the\
  \ imagination with serene landscapes.\n\nWhy Bhutan?\n\nBhutan is home to the few\
  \ most peaceful and liberal mankind one can find on earth. Bhutan is the only country\
  \ that uses Gross National Happiness as an indicator to measure its prosperity.\
  \ Almost 72% of Bhutan\u2019s land is covered with forest. Each and every town of\
  \ Bhutan is its center of attraction. They are surrounded by mountains from all\
  \ directions which is rare and a beauty in itself. It is also the first no-smoking\
  \ country in the world. Bhutan is like an innocent child who lives in his own world,\
  \ and I say this because it is very much in its own cultural domain, the outside\
  \ world seems distant when traveling to Bhutan. \nPeople in Bhutan are satisfied\
  \ and contented with their lives in the country. They don\u2019t believe in taking\
  \ part in the rat race like other countries, which leads to violence, disregard\
  \ for environment and an unhappy habitat. The Bhutanese prefer living close to their\
  \ roots with less materialistic things. They love their king! Why else would they\
  \ have planted 1,08,000 trees in the honor of the birth of Bhutan\u2019s prince.\n\
  Lastly, I have an interesting story to share that made me realize where I actually\
  \ stand in life. I met a guy, he was the owner of a restaurant in Thimphu. He served\
  \ us some delicious food and while i was paying the bill, I thanked him for the\
  \ amazing food. In reply, he asked me where i was from, I said Pune. He suddenly\
  \ spoke to me in Marathi. I was shocked! He then explained that he had done his\
  \ engineering from Pune University. My curiosity made me ask a question-You are\
  \ highly qualified, you could have had a promising career? What are you doing here\
  \ in Bhutan? His answer was real gem:\n\u201CWhile i was pursuing my engineering\
  \ I realized that there is a big competition to outperform others. My batch mates\
  \ used to work hard for getting top grades, over participation in not just lectures\
  \ but everything. On the contrary I felt something very odd doing that. People there\
  \ are only concerned about survival, without knowing how to live. I could not live\
  \ in a world like that. I am happy earning less here with my family close to me\
  \ rather than just earning money for our survival.\u201D His words proved to me\
  \ that indeed, happy living is all about enjoying small pleasures of Life!"
