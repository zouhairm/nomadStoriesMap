Text: "Bebian comes from a lineage of impeccable posture and stands tall, yet covers\
  \ her eyes and hides her young face as she reveals her dream of becoming a nurse.\
  \ I am slow to respond on the exterior, yet my interior races with all the complications\
  \ involved in such a dream \u2013 the educational costs, the logistics of leaving\
  \ home and boarding at a school far from her family, the question of where she might\
  \ work even if she brought this beautiful dream to fruition. I repress the urge\
  \ to inundate her with queries and smile at her brave answer.\n\nHer widowed mother\
  \ moves through the motions of hospitality with grace, but I catch a glimpse of\
  \ what looks like frustration and heartbreak brought on by a history of war and\
  \ disease. They have a goat I attempt to pet, but Bebian's response makes it clear\
  \ that their lack of affection for this animal is intentional. They seem to preserve\
  \ their affection for a spade and the dark, overworked earth that provides their\
  \ family with green beans, yams, bananas, and maize.\n\nAs we sit in a small room\
  \ illuminated by a puny flashlight hanging from the earthen wall, Sietta shares\
  \ a fragment of her story. Then she asks us why we are here. The unarticulated answer\
  \ still swirls within my soul as I struggle to compose a sentence that makes sense\
  \ in either of our cultures.\n\nThe only explanation I can confidently provide is\
  \ music. The only gift I can provide that doesn\u2019t feel tied to an agenda thick\
  \ with corruption or greed is music. I can study the music of their culture and\
  \ bring in my understanding of a human\u2019s physiologic response to the rhythm,\
  \ timbre, and harmonic structure of a song. I can combine the evidence provided\
  \ by advanced technology and intertwine it with this ancient practice and say, \u201C\
  Sing! The wisdom of your ancestors is finally being proven by EEGs and fMRIs. Sing\
  \ and clap and dance as I acknowledge the ways in which you are enhancing neural\
  \ activity both individually and collectively. Sing proudly and trust that I know\
  \ you sing not with reckless abandon, but with great intention and unwavering purpose.\u201D\
  \n\nSietta and her older daughter escort us up the steep trail in the morning. When\
  \ we get to the main road and it is time to bid this woman farewell, I feel the\
  \ urge to kneel before her, reach into my ribcage and present my heart for some\
  \ sort of blessing. Just one night in her presence has taught me so much and I struggle\
  \ to express my gratitude appropriately. I take her hands in mine and whisper, \u201C\
  Webale.\u201D"
