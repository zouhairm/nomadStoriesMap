Text: "Do you remember this story about Moses and his people finally getting out of\
  \ endless and eternal dessert? Forget it - they never did. Running from Pharaon\
  \ and his sizzling God for 40 years, and everything they got in the end - unswerving,\
  \ inspective presence of Ra, who still has his arms stretched over the entire land\
  \ of Israel and Israel itself being the child of a dessert. This ruthless father\
  \ of ancient Egypt still wants his debt to be paid; he bites and he stings, he spreads\
  \ fire and commands. \n\nAt my first day in Israel, there was a wind not very different\
  \ from air conditioning set for heating. Golden waves of moving barkhans - not a\
  \ wind at all. In this breathless, stifling air the hardest thing was to be grateful.\
  \ There is no chance you would stand in the heart of the desert enjoying the lack\
  \ of oxygen and saying prayers in gratitude. \"Thank you, father, for thou hast\
  \ given me this land\". Everything that breathes should hate this wind that exposes\
  \ your lungs and reveals your soul. \n\n\"Why would anyone live here?\" I was not\
  \ judging, just being curious and I perhaps held an admiration in my heart for those\
  \ who made this bloodless piece of earth their home. In my carefree and still childishly\
  \ naive mind it was a story of great devotion and with a high probability religion\
  \ matter - a desire to stick with roots, to follow the flow of fate. Something with\
  \ great symbolism, with no doubt. \n\nIssac, a young man in his twenty-something,\
  \ who led me from one city to another, smiled conspiratorially like he knew the\
  \ answer. He had these celestial blue eyes inspired trust and confidence even in\
  \ strangers and he was not very ashamed of using it to his advantage. \n\n\"No one.\
  \ That's the point\", he shrugged his shoulders. \"It's not a choice, you see. This\
  \ place is just home... It stays here whatever you do, and you just keep coming\
  \ back. Like it is supposed to be, I guess\". He grinned and I thought I understood.\
  \ It does not matter where you will come at the end of your journey, this place\
  \ may even not be worth it: it is your path that is important, it is your ways of\
  \ getting there. I tried to breathe this thought through.\n\n\"But in case it's\
  \ important: I absolutely hate this place\", Issac added with wicked irony, killing\
  \ the inspiration and the glory of the moment. \"Everyone does. Everyone stays\"\
  . \n\nThe sun was high above our heads.\n\n\"Kill the sacrificial bull, I'll show\
  \ you my mercy\", said Ra to those who once were in slavery. But they will never\
  \ honour him, will they?"
