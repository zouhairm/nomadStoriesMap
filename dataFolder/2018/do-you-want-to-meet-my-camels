Text: "Eyes closed, arms outstretched to the sides, his whole body is jolting and\
  \ swaying to a song that only he can hear. Occasionally, he stops to swallow a mouthful\
  \ of chai tea, and gesture us to join his dancing, but we are not accustomed to\
  \ this heavy, oppressive heat of the Indian monsoon. \_From up here on the rooftop,\
  \ we are at least offered some respite from the chaos of Jaisalmer, the constant\
  \ roaring of traffic, and the relentless shouting of street hawkers.\_None of us\
  \ move, and so his one man show continues.\n\nEventually even Abu tires, and throws\
  \ himself onto a bean bag. For a moment he is silent, deep in thought. He casts\
  \ his eyes over the Golden City of Rajasthan, tracing the streets and buildings\
  \ towards Jaisalmer Fort, a huge, intricate sandcastle that seems to watch over\
  \ the city. He eyes the four of us, the only guests staying at his hostel in the\
  \ middle of the low season.\n\n\"Do you want to meet my camels?\"\n\nHaving known\
  \ Abu a few days, I am not surprised by his quite random question. Last night was\
  \ spent in his favourite restaurant, with a feast of traditional dishes, which we\
  \ were forced to eat even when we declared ourselves full. A few hours ago I was\
  \ clinging to the back of his motorcycle, as he expertly weaved through the hectic\
  \ city streets with admirable ease, just so that he could introduce me to his favourite\
  \ Lassi vendor.\_\n\nAnd so, after a few hours drive into the Thar desert, I am\
  \ sat atop \"Micheal Jackson\" with my head wrapped in a bright pink scarf. Abu\
  \ leads the way, dismounting his camel to show us dung beetles, tell us stories\
  \ of his childhood, or point out specific plants. The sun is relentless, and we\
  \ begin to wilt in the heat, our hands barely able to hold onto our camel reigns.\_\
  \ Colourful blankets are spread neatly on the sand, our beds for the evening.\n\n\
  The sun has long disappeared behind the dunes, taking the scorching Indian heat\
  \ with it. A gentle wind whips sand into the dying fire, soft crackles breaking\
  \ the silence. Lying on my back, I bury my hands in to the sand, which still retains\
  \ the warmth of the day.\_With no civilisation for miles around and no man made\
  \ light to dim the view, the sky overhead is studded with an infinite amount of\
  \ stars. My eyes trace the unmistakable band of the Milky Way, like a pot of glitter\
  \ thrown across a black canvas.\n\nWe marvel at the beauty, pointing out shooting\
  \ stars and far off constellations. Abu sleeps through our excited chatter, having\
  \ seen this sight a thousand times."
