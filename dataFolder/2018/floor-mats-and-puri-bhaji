Text: "Last week, I heard from someone I hadn\u2019t heard from since the last time\
  \ I saw him. I heard Babu\u2019s earthy voice yell into the earpiece \u201CI am\
  \ father!\u201D. Touched that he had called me, I congratulated him, my memory relaying\
  \ back to the day I met him two years ago. He was the first person I spoke to when\
  \ I got off the rickety bus in Hospet, the nearest town to Hampi village. I don\u2019\
  t know if it was his adorably broken English, his colorful lungi, or his tobacco-filled\
  \ mouth that caught my attention, but I set off to Hampi village in his rickshaw.\
  \ Once in Hampi, he took me to his house for breakfast. His tiny living room had\
  \ only plastic chairs and floor mats. A sari-clad lady walked in, and he proudly\
  \ introduced her, \u201CMy wife, we in love from we are 8 years old. 20 years now\u201D\
  , making her blush. As I ate puri-bhaji (fried bread with potato gravy) with them,\
  \ sitting on their floor mats, I felt strangely fulfilled. Humbled by their austerity\
  \ and enlightened by the love they shared, something I had lost faith in and had\
  \ just rediscovered, I thanked his wife and left with Babu. Around noon, after I\
  \ was done witnessing the magic of the SaReGaMa pillars in Vittala temple, I realized\
  \ I\u2019d lost him. I approached some rickshaw drivers nearby and enquired about\
  \ him. \u201CHere no Babu\u201D, one said. Upon my describing his physical stature,\
  \ he yelled, \u201CDixcy! Oye Dixcy!\u201D. Out of nowhere, a sheepish looking Babu\
  \ came running. While he took me to Matanga hill to watch the sunset, he explained\
  \ that those were his childhood friends who had spotted 6 year old him in a holey\
  \ pair of Dixcy underwear and had called him that since. I cracked up and saw his\
  \ ears go red. It is amazing how quickly we bond when we\u2019re travelling \u2013\
  \ maybe it\u2019s the transience, knowing that we don\u2019t have much time together.\
  \ As we sat on a rock at Matanga, I asked Babu about his tobacco addiction. He said,\
  \ \u201CI know bad. I try hard, but no stop\u201D. I could sense his sincerity.\
  \ Having had a cancer patient in the family, I\u2019d learnt a few lessons the hard\
  \ way. I just said, \u201CThink of her. You don\u2019t want to leave her here alone\u201D\
  . He was quiet. The sunset descended upon us, sealing that moment of unspoken words,\
  \ and under its heliotrope hues, Hampi emanated the regality it once boasted as\
  \ the capital of the Vijaynagara Empire. As we got off Matanga, he said, \u201C\
  Daily I cut little. One day stop. Next time you come Hampi, call. You see no tobacco.\
  \ Take my number.\u201D I saved it, as he flashed a grin reading his contact name,\
  \ \u201CDixcy\u201D."
