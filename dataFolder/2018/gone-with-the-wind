Text: "\u201CI wish we would come here once more, together!\u201D. Shahroz whispered,\
  \ looking towards the horizon as the sun shined brighter on the serene waters of\
  \ River Neelum.\nAs the final semester of under-graduation commenced, arrangements\
  \ for conclusive year visit started. One evening we put forth out and about excursion\
  \ with the cluster of crazy companions towards our goal in Azad Kashmir. As we ascended,\
  \ the lush green mountains and gushing rivers of Neelum accompanied us. A smile\
  \ graced my face as I caught a glimpse of Shahroz gazing at me. Never did I expect\
  \ that our relationship would experience such a change from being best friends to\
  \ soulmates. Old friends, new relations, excitement and great weather were some\
  \ of the perks of the journey; there were also the not-so-perky points, like the\
  \ early morning wake-ups and freezing water.\nOur Ist stopover was at Sharda. \u201C\
  The ruins of the famous temple and Hindu pilgrimage site Sharda Peeth, dedicated\
  \ to the goddess Sharada who represents learning, is situated in this town\u201D\
  , a local told us.The absence of signals and internet services was a wonderful liberation\
  \ to make us closer to each other. A desi breakfast of omelets and parathas with\
  \ a cup of tea is all you will find around this area, but it is enough to charge\
  \ you up for the adventures ahead. From Sharda, we began a two-hour bumpy jeep ride\
  \ to Kel Village. The road to Kel, wide enough for only one vehicle to pass at a\
  \ time, had blind curves. Shahroz captured the majestic views of the valley with\
  \ the noisy blue waters of the Neelum River flowing on one side, and crystal-clear\
  \ waterfalls on the other. \nAt night we gathered outside the farmhouse and launched\
  \ sky lanterns in the dark serene sky. \u201CLet us wait to see whose lantern shines\
  \ longer\u201D, challenged a friend. Those were the last days for all of us together.\
  \ Nobody knew where the life would take us after graduation. The trip to the valley\
  \ was incomplete without the hiking. Half an hour in our hiking towards ArangKel\
  \ and we were greeted by the rain showers. As we strolled through the valley at\
  \ night, with torches as the only source of light, left us mesmerized.\nAs we descend\
  \ the downhill, we left a part of ourselves behind. Today, I remember giggles and\
  \ recollections only even though we are no more together. I did not anticipate separation\
  \ to happen that soon but what is that feeling when you're driving away from people-\
  \ it's good-bye. But we lean forward to the next crazy venture beneath the skies."
