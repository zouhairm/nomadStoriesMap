Text: "After an invigorating hike through the base of Volc\xE1n Casablanca in southern\
  \ Chile, all Alex and I wanted was a shower and a meal. We caught to earlier possible\
  \ bus from the shores of Lago Rupanco, and hummed tiredly into the tiny bedroom\
  \ community of Alerce at some point the following afternoon. Alex's friend Pauli\
  \ lived here with her family, and Alex was sure they'd take in a couple of weary\
  \ travelers for the sake of our hygiene and nourishment.\nBut when we got off the\
  \ bus, sweaty and dusty and aching, there was no sign of life in the house. It was\
  \ a work day, after all--our internal clocks had been skewed by a couple of enchanting\
  \ days in the mountains. \n \"No one's home,\" Alex concluded as we peered into\
  \ her friend's window. \"We're going to have to break in.\"\n \"She'll be okay with\
  \ that?\" I wondered.\n Alex shrugged. Before I knew it, she was plummeting tail-first\
  \ through their kitchen window and into their sink. \n Here we were: two best friends\
  \ from the same small town, separated by eight years of life and until this trip,\
  \ thousands of miles. Now we were diving into somebody's kitchen through the window,\
  \ having pried it open with our fingers, which were shaking and dirt-smeared from\
  \ days in the wild, in the throes of adventure in its most thrilling and untranslatable\
  \ form\u2014and we loved it.\n We unpacked days-old sandwiches from our packs and\
  \ each took a shower. While Alex was in the bathroom I relished in the home's Wi-Fi,\
  \ contacting my family for the first time in nearly a week. I'm alive! my text likely\
  \ read, failing to mention the physically rigor of the past few days.\n Soon, though,\
  \ with Alex still in the shower, a knock echoed through this unfamiliar house into\
  \ which I had just broken. My Spanish was severely limited, and Alex was occupied;\
  \ I had no choice but to open the door.\n I recognized the man from pictures I'd\
  \ seen earlier in the week: this was Pauli's brother, who lived part-time in another\
  \ city and was clearly visiting unannounced, keyless. \n \"Hi,\" I said in my best\
  \ Spanish. \"I'm a friend of Alex's. Pauli is gone.\"\n He looked tragically confused,\
  \ and while he didn't make any gestures encouraging me to leave his house, he did\
  \ make a few frantic phone calls to his mother. Suddenly I could understand his\
  \ Spanish: \"Mom, there's a girl in the house! Yes, a girl in the house! Who is\
  \ she?\"\nThe whole time, I only wished I knew how to say, \"Why didn't you just\
  \ come in through the window?\" in Spanish."
