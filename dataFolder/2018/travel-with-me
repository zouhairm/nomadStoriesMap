Text: "Trinidad, Cuba. Great weather, tourists and locals out for the day, Mojitos\
  \ and street bands on every corner. The perfect day to be traveling solo in the\
  \ sun.\n\nI see an older man sitting on a stool smoking a cigar in the streets.\
  \ Exactly the man one expects to see in Cuba. A throwback from an era of Cuban high\
  \ life. Like a thousand tourists before me, I ask politely to take his picture.\
  \ He obliges graciously. \n\nHis manner was so warm and welcoming. He looked like\
  \ a story-teller, and he was. I asked if I could join him for a cigarette and he\
  \ welcomed the company. He introduced himself as Se\xF1or Jose Luis, 76yrs old.\
  \ For the next hour he described what it was like for him growing up in Trinidad,\
  \ the revoltion, the death of his best friend. Unexpectedly, he suggested I visit\
  \ Don Pepe\u2019s, a local coffee shop around the corner. He wasn\u2019t kidding\
  \ when he said I\u2019d have the best coffee in Cuba there.\n\nThe rest of the day\
  \ was lack lustre in comparison with my hour spent with Se\xF1or Jose Luis. It\u2019\
  s incredible how a candid interaction with a stranger can change one\u2019s day.\
  \ But that\u2019s the beauty about travel; the way one lets down their guard and\
  \ opens up to a person they might not otherwise pay attention to in the comfort\
  \ of their daily routine. The opportunity that could present itself could quite\
  \ possibly be an hour long lesson in local culture with a remarkable individual."
