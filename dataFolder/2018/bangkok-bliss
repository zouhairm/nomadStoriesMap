Text: "\u201CSometimes all you need is a change of environment,\u201D the fortune\
  \ that slid out of her now broken-in-two cookie.\nThe hot humid air slapped her\
  \ face with familiarity as she stepped off the plane at Suvarnabhumi Airport. The\
  \ smell of Bangkok, consisting of gasoline, cigarettes, and delicious foods filled\
  \ her nose once more and all was well. \u201CYou need to download Tinder,\u201D\
  \ her roommate said, \u201Clook at all the people you can meet!\u201D Being a romantic,\
  \ a reluctant sigh escaped from her chest as she rationalized the possibilities\
  \ of meeting the one, but she downloaded the new-age dating app from her bed in\
  \ The Rabbit Hole Hostel. In seconds, the possibility of hundreds of new human interactions\
  \ began to slide across her screen as she swiped right, swiped left, superliked,\
  \ laughed, and sent witty one-liners. All of it was empty until she saw Tom. A swift\
  \ swipe right and the conversation quickly flourished as a connection secretly seeded\
  \ itself unto the two. A day and a half of digital communication led them to pursue\
  \ the next step: actually meeting up! \nIn a foreign country. With a complete stranger.\
  \ That you\u2019ve met online.\nAccompanied by her male roommate, Brynn and Tom\
  \ made their first interaction at a rooftop bar in Bangkok. The city skyline as\
  \ a backdrop and flashes of heat lightning set the mood as a nervous pair began\
  \ to learn each others facial expressions, inflections, wants and desires. Brynn\
  \ didn\u2019t expect to find Tom spreading like tree roots into her heart; hours\
  \ of conversation easily passed. \n\u201CThis is crazy\u201D the two said the next\
  \ morning as they kissed goodbye in the rain. Tom made his way to Chiang Mai and\
  \ Brynn to Krabi. She found herself imagining him by her side as she snorkeled in\
  \ Maya Bay, fed monkeys on Monkey Island, and long-tail boated to the Phi Phi Islands.\
  \ Although looking forward to Chiang Mai due to Tom\u2019s descriptions of elephant\
  \ hikes and mud baths, savory Khao Soi, and a mountainous countryside, all she really\
  \ wanted was to see him again. \nUnbeknownst to her, Tom left his friends behind\
  \ as they travelled to Pattaya. He too needed to see the one who now consumed so\
  \ much of his mind. The smells of traditional Pad Thai wafted through the air while\
  \ sounds of the busy Chiang Mai Night bazaar resonated within their ears. Tom could\
  \ feel his heart swell as he looked at her as though she was magic. Brynn, feeling\
  \ his gaze, smiled from within. This was love.     \n\u201CWhen Tom was in Thailand,\
  \ he met Brynn in Bangkok, and they chilled in Chiang Mai.\u201D"
