Text: "'No way this could be so incredibly hard' I thought while indecisively remembering\
  \ unforgettable travel stories worth writing about for this scholarship. \nWhat\
  \ I hadn't realized until now was that the decision pushing me to the edge had just\
  \ been made. \n\nIt all started around two years ago when I consciously read my\
  \ first travel blog about South America. A young woman, leaving all behind to travel\
  \ by herself through this huge continent. \n\nI had chosen the reasonable, the 'successful'\
  \ way after graduating. My goal was to get a job that I could be working as internationally.\
  \ \nTherefore I started and finished an apprenticeship in a shipping company in\
  \ the beautiful city of Hamburg. \nIt could have not been any more exciting to move\
  \ from the peaceful island I grew up on into the huge roaring city where, I was\
  \ convinced, all dreams come true.\n\nThe programm started off as a plain success.\
  \ I got the chance to go outside the country, joined workshops and learned a lot,\
  \ not only about shipping. I felt contented with my own decision.\n\nA few months\
  \ into work life though, the business life's facade started crumbling but by persuading\
  \ myself all this is 'going to look great on my CV' I was able to suppress the upwelling\
  \ doubts.\n\nHad I though? Had I chosen the life that fits me?\nI could have not\
  \ asked for anything more in my well-planned, well-paid, well-endowed lifestyle.\
  \ Having a fixed income, stable job, a supporting family and loving boyfriend it\
  \ felt ungrateful to question my purpose.\n\nSplit in between the world of infinite\
  \ gratitude and unsatisfied inquisitiveness, I fell into a dark hole of confusion.\
  \ \nIt was an effective lesson finally making me realize what I was truly missing:\n\
  Learning, seeing and feeling reality within the conscious clarity of ALL my senses!\n\
  \nCarrying the burden of knowing I was living a life which wasn't determined for\
  \ my soul it was hard keeping a straight face. The urge for a change became untenable\
  \ and I simply had to break out of the shell I put on myself. \n\nEven though my\
  \ desire wasn't understood by all, I got unconditional support from others that\
  \ have watched my lively spirit dying in the gilded cage. \n\nI suddenly found myself\
  \ quitting my job, finding a backpack and finally traveling through the diverse\
  \ landscapes of beautiful Chile. \nIt's been a month since the wheels of my plane\
  \ left the rainy, grey asphalt, taking me to my first pure adventure - unique, intense,\
  \ terrifying, absolutely fantastic and just exactly what I truly craved!"
