Text: "I first landed in New York City when I was a teeneger. From that fleeting trip\
  \ of a few weeks I came to the conclusion that I would return to fulfill a dream:\
  \ write and work in New York, the city of steel, glass and asphalt. That decision\
  \ pushed me many years later to move to New York for professional reasons. It was\
  \ time to make my dream come true, a dream set two decades earlier. What was to\
  \ be a two year stay ended up being five. New York City was never fascinating to\
  \ me because of its majestic buildings, endless avenues or crowded streets. What\
  \ fascinates me about New York City is the cultural and social mix gestated by immigrants\
  \ that makes the \u201CBig Apple\u201D never sleep: from those who arrived more\
  \ than a century ago escaping the war and the European famine to those who lived\
  \ through the golden moments of the 1920s and the decrepitude of the Great Depression.\
  \ When I arrived in New York City, Europe was suffering one of the most important\
  \ economic crisis in years. Immigrant life is not easy. New York City is as receptive\
  \ to the arrival of immigrants as it is harsh in their daily life. As one more immigrant\
  \ I had to face, day by day, survival, not only because for my limited command of\
  \ the language, but also because of cultural differences for a European like me.\
  \ New York City is on a league of its own in the United States: literally, Manhattan\
  \ is an island with peculiar idiosyncracies. The city of neon lights is also the\
  \ city of misery. A point of reference for me in New York is The Spanish Benevolent\
  \ Society, which is at 239 West 14th Street. The only brownstone that remain of\
  \ what was once \"Little Spain\". The building dates back to 1868, when Spain lost\
  \ the War of Cuba. Today it is a private social club that is nourished by the contributions.\
  \ A hot plate of food is always available for Spanish immigrants who seek refuge\
  \ in the big city. The building was almost in ruins until few years ago. Then The\
  \ Society obtained money from donations to remodel some parts of the building. The\
  \ old winding wood stairs, which are well preserved, creak under the weight of a\
  \ 150 years of history. The large office on the second floor houses the archives\
  \ of cards of those who came before me: where they came from, how old they were,\
  \ what their trade was and, when they died, where they were buried. There are also\
  \ old and worn out photographs that almost look like papyrus: faces of past young\
  \ immigrants, their stories converging in this special building, including my own."
