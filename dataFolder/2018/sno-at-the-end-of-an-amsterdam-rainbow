Text: "Before knocking on Ramona Sno\u2019s door, I make sure I have everything I\
  \ need: phone, camera, notebook, pen, as if minimizing what i brought would shrink\
  \ the anxiety bubbling under my raincoat. I Inhale. I knock. I exhale as the woman\
  \ I came to interview quickly makes her way to the door. I see for the first time,\
  \ her curly hair that has been colored purple; and I tell myself the nerves are\
  \ coming from a healthy place, because I care about the research I am doing. \u201C\
  Come on in.\u201D Her heavy Dutch accent still catching me by surprise. Having only\
  \ briefly introduced ourselves through email, I ask her if i can begin setting up\
  \ and we begin making small talk. Along with our blackness, I share with her that\
  \ I am also queer and interested to hear how our shared intersections of identity\
  \ can be shaped differently in the Netherlands, the first country in the world to\
  \ legalize gay marriage. De Trut, translation: The Bitch, open only on Sunday\u2019\
  s, is one of Amsterdam\u2019s most frequented gay clubs of the city's 800 thousand\
  \ plus population and 3.5 million visitors each year. Founded in the early 80s for\
  \ queers to dance and congregate safely from hate-crimes and promote gay liberation,\
  \ similar to many mainstream gay spaces, it is dominated by cisgendered White men.\
  \ Similar to the United States history of liberation, Ramona shares how as a queer\
  \ Black woman, her ability to be free in even the most liberated spaces is limited\
  \ by ignorance. She describes herself, to my pleasant surprise akin to the late\
  \ Black Lesbian Feminist Audre Lorde: \u201Cfat and Black,\u201D but this, she quotes\
  \ other\u2019s attacks towards her \u201Cis not the way to be at De Trut.\u201D\
  \ My heart, somewhere now between my esophagus and knees, is touched by the way\
  \ she describes the first time she hooked up at De Trut as a moment of \u201Csexual\
  \ solidarity\u201D between her and another woman of color, and I quickly wipe away\
  \ my tears as she reminisces at the memory of her lover. \u201CPersian, Persies?\
  \ I don\u2019t know how to say this in English.\u201D I smile back to her, \u201C\
  That was right,\u201D grateful I can affirm Ramona in some way, still wanting to\
  \ do more as I remember growing up as a Black queer girl in Anchorage, Alaska. \u201C\
  She made me feel beautiful, perfect as a person, just the way I was, we talked about\
  \ everyone else being white, and the hookup itself defied the norm of that space.\u201D\
  \ I set down the camera, feeling full off the vulnerability and stories shared between\
  \ us."
