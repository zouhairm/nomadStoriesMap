Text: "It was a bright fullmoon night, gleaming in from the window. I knew a decition\
  \ has to be made and it was not easy. \nLeaving everything behind to explore the\
  \ unknown, one always has been dreaming off, or staying in the old and keep dreaming.\
  \ The moonshine was so soft yet strong. - friends had been leaving for amerika -\
  \ a voice lured me into a different dirrection. - into the North.\nThere were a\
  \ few infos only, that I knew about finnland. The more i red, the stronger was the\
  \ calling. After a few months of preperations, i quit my job, lost few tears on\
  \ the airport and my adventure begann.\nIt was the smallest airplane i've been in\
  \ so far.Two businessmen were sitting close and were watching me in tears earlier.\
  \ They asked where I was heading, so I answered I  am on my way to stay in Finland\
  \ for a while. \nThey were surprised and asked if i didn't think another country\
  \ would be better for english or international experience - but I was certain that\
  \ the choice was right.\nAgain there was a bright hughe fullmoon outside. Gleaming\
  \ onto a magic carpet out of cloudes. It was magical to watch this. And a seren\
  \ feeling grew in my heart. A little while later one could see the lights of Helsinki\
  \ glittering through the clouds of moonlight. Excitement took hold of me. Iam back,\
  \ and this time i will get to know the country and spend time there to shape myself\
  \ into nordic culture. All the doubts if it is possible or not had been cleared\
  \ out. Great! Life finaly could start in brand new settings!\nAfter the landing,\
  \ the two busynessmen kept still an eye on me so I would not get lost, afterall\
  \ the father of my new hostfamily would pick me up. He easily was found and I stepped\
  \ into a new world. Time and light seemed different here and it almost felt like\
  \ a dream. \nWe reached the longhouse they lived in with their related family next\
  \ door. It was a bit outside of the town. Trees infont of the house and with huge\
  \ windows going to the frozen lake.\nMy room was downstairs, it was groundlevel\
  \ so the window was into the quiet peacefull backyardgarden. Of course filled with\
  \ snow. The next day i was running through the snowscape - just celebrating my arrival.\
  \ The following Fridayeve the mom dropped me to Helsinki to meet the son of her\
  \ friend to get to see helsinki, it was dark but the city was quite alive. Nice\
  \ nordic athmosphere. It was in a awesome rockmusic club a redesigned old church,\
  \ where I fully realized my life just began and I made it. While watching the bands\
  \ and drinking some cider i felt so alive!.."
