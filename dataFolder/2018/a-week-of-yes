Text: "Somewhere between ignition and breaks, between right and left and can and can\u2019\
  t, my mind forgot it had hands, and my hands forgot I had a brain. Fifteen eternal,\
  \ minted seconds hit like a monsoon, and I, a slow motion, wobbly octopus was too\
  \ paralyzed to save myself from a motorbike sandwich. \n\nMy only goal was to ride\
  \ a motorcycle in Pai, a small town in northern Thailand near the Myanmar border\
  \ famed for its lush, panoramic landscapes, hydrothermal springs and pulsing creative\
  \ culture. And motorbikes, of course; the one, true way to see it all.\n\nThey made\
  \ it seem elementary, the locals. Young mothers carelessly breezing down hilly roads\
  \ with an infant wrapped to her bosom, a toddler at her back and grandma, the unflinching\
  \ caboose holding them all together. \n\nReal-time and the pain begins, deep around\
  \ the marrow of my bones to the punctured slab of salami that was once my skin.\
  \ Three bikes, one on top of the other, sequester my left leg to the concrete barricade\
  \ of our hotel parking lot.\n\nMy best friend, Devon, rushes to my aid, along with\
  \ a jovial local familiar with scenes such as these. Bike accidents are common in\
  \ Pai, a right of passage chiefly among tourists. I just didn\u2019t think that\
  \ would be me.\n\n\u201CThrow your ego over the wall,\u201D read a mural in prophetic,\
  \ neon paint when we first arrived in Thailand; a useful sentiment for our week-long\
  \ adventure. \n\nWhen it took three days for my backpack to arrive, I made peace\
  \ with the clothes on my back, dampened with sweat and seawater.  Yesterday, our\
  \ driver missed his freeway exit and reversed for five, excruciating minutes against\
  \ traffic. That time I made peace with death. \n\nSomehow, though, we just kept\
  \ smiling, and Thailand kept giving. \n\nReconciling this crash was hard. After\
  \ an hour of icing, medicating and elevation, it was clear no bones were broken,\
  \ just my courage and ego with sprains and bruises. \n\n\u201CDo you want to try\
  \ again?\u201D Devon asked, an encouraging sport. \n\n\u201CNo, I can\u2019t.\u201D\
  \ I hesitated. \u201CBut you should.\u201D\n\nShe studied me.  \u201COnly if you\
  \ ride behind me.\u201D \n\nI ran away from things that scared me before. If I kept\
  \ running, I wouldn\u2019t be here. \n\nShe was a natural; the machine an extension\
  \ of her body. I cautiously wrapped my arms around her waist, and together we inhaled.\
  \  \n\nTraversing the cloistered, colorful streets while avoiding dogs and vendors,\
  \ we were finally at the edge of the town center. An elderly man studied my bandaged\
  \ leg while we waited at the stoplight. He nodded with a toothy grin and sent us\
  \ on our way."
