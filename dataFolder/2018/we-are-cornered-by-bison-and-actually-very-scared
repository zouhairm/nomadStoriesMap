Text: "The wind in the valley blew my hair out of my neatly tucked and slightly out-of-style\
  \ man bun as we laid out our tents and watched another group of campers chase a\
  \ tablecloth dancing across the field. The long dirt road to the Sage Creek Campsite\
  \ was trail-blazed by westerners with pickup trucks twice as powerful as the Honda\
  \ minivan that took us here from New York just a day earlier. \n     The sun was\
  \ still high in the sky, and we were eager to explore the rolling hills of the Badlands.\
  \ I put my seven-book MCAT review series into my tent, providing enough weight to\
  \ keep wind from turning my home into a stringless kite. We spotted a herd of bison\
  \ feeding on the ridge, and went closer, walking in sandals after climbing the Badland\u2019\
  s crumbly pillars.\n    A gully separated us from the herd of hundreds, each one\
  \ massive and altogether an unstoppable force. The wind continued to blow our t-shirts\
  \ tight when out of nowhere we turned around and saw that a second branch of the\
  \ herd had wandered behind us, slowly traversing between us and the campground that\
  \ now seemed miles away. Suddenly, my brother sprinted across the dense brush, impulsively\
  \ shooting for an opening in the unparted sea. I followed reluctantly, and we stopped\
  \ 100 meters away, feet scratched and now even more trapped by the herd.\n \u201C\
  We are cornered by bison, and actually very scared\u201D, I said into my camera,\
  \ creating a visual memory that would become a meaningful symbol. We knew it was\
  \ best to wait it out, but we were three impatient young men fueled by adrenaline\
  \ and canned kidney beans adventuring in the Badlands; no way would we make this\
  \ easy. We wound in circles staring at the bison who cared far more about the yellowing\
  \ grass than our presence. Yet there were many calves, and coming from a loving\
  \ matriarchy back home,  we did not want to threaten mama\u2019s children when she\u2019\
  s nearby. A gap just wide enough opened and we took our chance, sprinting 20 feet\
  \ from the herd on either side, and arriving back at the campsite out of breath\
  \ and mentally drained.  \n We saw that other campers noticed the animals and were\
  \ taking out their phones and cameras to capture the herd. For some reason, we resented\
  \ the photographers and felt superior to those who crowded around to get a peek\
  \ of the buffalo. We had connected with them, felt their power and learned to respect\
  \ them as more than a spectacle. A photograph could never capture something so real\
  \ yet so intangible as the fright inherent in nature\u2019s beauty."
