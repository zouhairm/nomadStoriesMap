Text: "\u201CMankind is afraid of time, and time is afraid of the Pyramids.\u201D\
  \ As the awe-inspiring voice loomed across the open-air auditorium, a feeling of\
  \ being transported 3000 years back in time suddenly hit me. Sitting there, in front\
  \ of the majestic Pyramids and Sphinx, I was watching a late-night light-and-sound\
  \ show in Giza,Egypt. The narrator did a perfect job of creating an aura of mystery\
  \ and intrigue and the lights complemented it perfectly. Hans Zimmer would have\
  \ been proud of the background score that sent periodic chills down the spines of\
  \ the enthralled audience. Here stood the Pyramids, in an expansive image of fortitude,\
  \ showing no signs of going anywhere in a hurry. \nEgypt has about 14 million tourists\
  \ visiting each year. In December of 2017, I was one of them. During that trip,\
  \ by talking to some of the locals, I picked up quite an interesting story. \nEvery\
  \ culture has their own versions of the Apocalypse. Similarly, Ancient Egyptians\
  \ had their own. They believed that, a long time ago, the sun god Ra was angry with\
  \ the human race and wanted them wiped off the face of the Earth. This job was given\
  \ to the God Hathor, the cow god. But when Hathor was traveling to Earth to carry\
  \ out the killing, Ra had a change of heart. \u201CMaybe killing every single human\
  \ on the planet is a bit extreme.\u201D he may have thought to himself while having\
  \ his morning coffee to clear his head. \nBut Hathor was already on her way to do\
  \ exactly that, and since she wasn\u2019t carrying a cell phone. So, Ra hatched\
  \ a master plan to stop Hathor and passed it on to the humans. When Hathor reached\
  \ Earth, she was greeted by thousands of soldiers, all offering her their thick\
  \ red blood in a cup to drink. And drink she did, because that was her mission,\
  \ drink the blood of all humans. She found the blood quite intoxicating, and she\
  \ kept on drinking, cup after cup, until finally, feeling quite drowsy, she slowly\
  \ drifted off into a deep slumber. Of course, as you may have guessed, it wasn\u2019\
  t really human blood she was being offered, it was red wine! This is how the apocalypse\
  \ was averted. \nIt is believed that, to this day, Hathor lies deep in sleep, waiting\
  \ patiently till the day her slumber breaks to wreak havoc on all humankind, to\
  \ bring about the apocalypse. But before that, she would probably want an aspirin\
  \ or two to get rid of her 5000-years-in-the-making hangover. Also, it is no longer\
  \ the age of swords and arrows. How effective is modern weaponry against a god,\
  \ we will just have to wait and see!"
