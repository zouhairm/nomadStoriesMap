Text: "\u201CHospital! Hospital!\u201D \n\nSwift, violent, and unrelenting, the sickness\
  \ had taken hold in a matter of hours. In desperation, I awoke a man, a stranger,\
  \ to communicate that I needed a doctor. Though we spoke different languages, he\
  \ understood.\n\nWe drove into the dark, under scouring streetlights, as I laid\
  \ restless. The man did his best to comfort me. He turned to a radio station playing\
  \ American music, and asked slowly, in pronounced English: \u201CWhat..it...says?\u201D\
  \ With my eyes shut, I concentrated on the lyrics and roughly translated the phrases\
  \ to a country song.\n\nArriving at the clinic well after midnight, I was treated\
  \ and diagnosed with Salmonella. Salmonella? The raw cookie dough disease?\n\nIn\
  \ shock, I was given fluids, antibiotics, and released into the care of my host-father\
  \ with specific instructions to stay in bed. The next day my study abroad group\
  \ was set to board a train to take us to Machu Picchu and I knew I would be on it.\n\
  \nAfraid my sickness would prevent me from boarding the 4:00 AM train to Aguas Calientes,\
  \ I covered the dark circles of my eyes and put on my best \u201CI\u2019m not dying\u201D\
  \ smile. Hugging my stomach through every switch-back, we rode up a rickety track\
  \ all 11, 000 feet into the Andes Mountains. \n\nAs we turned the ridge to get our\
  \ first glimpse of the famous peak, the bustling train of foreigners and locals\
  \ alike gazed up in awe. \n\nThe deserted, dark jungle starkly contrasted with the\
  \ bright tourists that swarmed the site. Weary from fighting Salmonella, I walked\
  \ with steady determination up hundreds of steps up Huayna Picchu, also referred\
  \ to as...The Stairs of Death.\n\nAfter hours of climbing up the 45 degree incline,\
  \ I sat on a boulder to take it all in: the jungle, the journey, the moment, the\
  \ mystery. The stones were whispering their stories, and I was there listening:\
  \ Oh the people we\u2019ve seen, each with their own tales of adventure that have\
  \ brought them to this place.\n\nThe past few days were  filled with  fear, mistrust,\
  \ and anxiety as well as joy, wonder, and excitement.\n\nI laughed, taking in my\
  \ new world, and cherished the brisk mountain air. Across the vast Peruvian jungle,\
  \ you could see the country for the place it is, not what it is supposed to be.\
  \ \n\nPeru is not a flashy tourist destination for the faint of heart, but rather\
  \ a land of rugged, unforgiving landscapes and colorful, genuine people.\n\nAtop\
  \ one of the world\u2019s most iconic wonders, I had walked the Stairs of Death,\
  \ and I was here."
