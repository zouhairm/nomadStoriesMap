Text: "Travelling to Namwera via bus was bound to be an unforgettable experience.\
  \ Lake Malawi, filled with hippos, the lush scenery of Mangochi, and the mountains\
  \ bordering Mozambique, were places I'd longed to visit. Feeling invincible, I embarked\
  \ on my journey. On approaching the River Shire, however, I was deep in thought.\
  \ It was a fast-flowing, deep, wide river, with wooden beams making up a one-way\
  \ bridge. The plastic bag swinging with every jolt, containing broken pieces of\
  \ the bus, particularly concerned me, as did the driver's ability to accurately\
  \ guage the wheel to beam position. I readjusted my ankle-length skirt, conscious\
  \ of the woman and child next to me, and waited.\n\nBeginning his crossing, the\
  \ driver aligned the wheels perfectly. He had successfully crossed a quarter of\
  \ the way, when I allowed myself to relax a little and stare out of the window.\
  \ With no railing on one side, there was an uninterrupted view of the raging waters\
  \ below. \n\nNoticing the driver had stopped, I glanced up to see an oncoming motorbike.\
  \ Undeterred by our progress, the biker was crossing regardless. He inched alongside\
  \ the bus, yelling angrily in Yao. Our driver moved slightly to the left, causing\
  \ the back-left wheel to come off the beams, and we were left hanging.\n\nThe driver\
  \ instructed us to move to the right side of the bus. He then took a moment to ponder\
  \ our predicament. The bus wouldn't get back on the beams whilst we were in it,\
  \ yet we couldn't exit the bus as the door hung precariously over the river. He\
  \ suggested we climb over him, out the window, and onto the outer railing. With\
  \ no other solution, we inched forward one by one, taking turns at helping each\
  \ other escape. With quite a crowd watching our antics, a cheer rang out once all\
  \ but the driver, were safely on the railing. \n\nAfter 45 minutes of using brute\
  \ strength, we managing to push the wheel onto the beam, realigning the bus. With\
  \ elation, adrenalin and sheer joy coursing through me, I hugged my companions.\
  \ We were literally on the edge, with a thin wooden beam separating us from the\
  \ end, yet we'd survived. Making our way back to the bus, a male voice called out\
  \ to me, \"Lady! Your skirt!\" Amidst the chaos and scramble, my modest skirt had\
  \ become lodged in my underwear, exposing my backside to the crowd of onlookers.\
  \ Wrenching it free, I stalked back to the bus, humiliated, as well as being emotionally\
  \ and physically exhausted. Having my backside exposed to all was the last thing\
  \ I expected on this journey."
