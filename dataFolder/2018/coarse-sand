Text: "\u2018The girl wishes to go to Jerash. Take her to Amman bus stop.\u2019 \n\
  His note had fallen out of my notebook, the place that had kept it so well hidden.\
  \ Those neatly written Arabic characters made my stomach squeak and threw me into\
  \ a reality I knew by heart. The reception, my question, the search for sweet treats\
  \ along Aqaba\u2019s South Beach and the dusty road to Saudi Arabia. \nChocolate\
  \ and eyes did indeed meet. Facebook IDs were exchanged. A jar of Dead Sea salt\
  \ stood in my hands and still lies, just barely open, beside my bed. Kept closed\
  \ like Pandora\u2019s Box, in an attempt not to let sweet memories turn sour.\n\
  At that point, it didn\u2019t even cross my mind that I was part of a select club\
  \ getting the same treatment. At that time, happiness was what I shared with my\
  \ half, at home and on the road.\nLife does have a funny sense of humour when it\
  \ transposes the weight of your backpack into your daily routine. \nAn e-mail. After\
  \ 5 months of silenzio stampa. \nBreath choked, fingers anxious.\n\u2018Maybe I\
  \ need more than here or Skype.\u2019\n\u2018What do you need? \u2026\u2019\n\u2018\
  You\u2019\nHad I heard that before, differently put? Were those 1700 km smashing\
  \ into my face? I exited the compose window furiously, in a furious flattery, to\
  \ be honest. A few minutes later, I changed my mind and typed my cold reply:\n\u2018\
  When did you make up your mind about that?\u2019\n\u2026\nLooking at the room, full\
  \ of all the stuff that had fallen out of the turquoise bag, I realised that cramping\
  \ 5 years into a 2-minute memory is a laudable accomplishment of our brain. The\
  \ kettle started whistling on the stove and my hurry to turn the fire off was cut\
  \ short by the doorbell. \n- It\u2019s me. I promised some more sea salt\u2026 and\
  \ the label on the package read \u2018Personal delivery\u2019."
