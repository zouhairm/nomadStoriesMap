Text: "I started my journey in Xinjiang on the day before last summer. Urumqi - Kuqa\
  \ - Kashgar / Tokwik Highway - Ili, route to Taxkorgan, Nalati and Bayin Crook,\n\
  \n\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\n\n\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_From Dihua to Qiuci\n\n\
  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_From Dihua (Urumqi) all the way to the south along the Tianshan\
  \ Mountains, around the nine reincarnation, over the victory of 4280 altitude Daban,\
  \ after Toxz turned west, over Yanqi, stay in Korla, the way Kucha, arrived in North\
  \ and South Akesu, a place where Xinjiang is divided. It is not only the standard\
  \ midline route of the Silk Road since ancient times, but also the beautiful section\
  \ that stretches from the northern territory to the southern Xinjiang in a day.\n\
  \n\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_In fact, from Hami and Shanshan to Xinjiang, they have had a\
  \ two-hour jet lag with the Mainland. They have swept past the old city of Gaohe\
  \ and the ancient city of Gaochang along the Kuqa Grand Canyon and Kizil Thousand\
  \ Buddha Caves, Gradually feel the history of thousands of years through the passage\
  \ of change experienced generations, dry braided rivers, the boundaries of the Bolten\
  \ Lake changes, deserted dunes on the ruins of natural geography and cultural layers\
  \ of symbiosis Back relationship.\n\n\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_I noticed the subtle changes\
  \ in the faces of the Uighurs and Kazakhs in the northern and southern Xinjiang.\
  \ Aksu was a small town with a typical Central Asian style. It was found that the\
  \ women there were all amazingly different from the Han Chinese. To go to a restaurant\
  \ called Al-kin, Kazakhstan national dress waiter did not fully understand the Chinese\
  \ language. You have to go to southern Xinjiang, such as Hotan and Bazaar, it really\
  \ made it abroad than abroad, what do not understand each other. It is indeed a\
  \ very dangerous road. But still very safe. I do not know how many people have been\
  \ able to go to southern Xinjiang since ancient times. Therefore, the necessary\
  \ facilities for road repair on both sides are very good."
