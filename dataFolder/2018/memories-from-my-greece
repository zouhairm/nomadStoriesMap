Text: "After so much time, it felt weird to go back home. \nWe walked along the port,\
  \ me, my mother and my sister, carrying our bags, while my father was driving the\
  \ car into the big ferryboat full of travelers greeting and smiling. The pier was\
  \ busy with new people coming to the island and with local people, curious as always\
  \ of those who came back and to meet those who set foot on the island for the first\
  \ time. \nIt has been ten years since that summer in Lipsi, Greece.\nSince I was\
  \ a little boy I have been used to travel around the little, colorful, wonderful\
  \ Greek islands in the Summertime.\nTen years later that summer in Lipsi I wonder\
  \ whether I have not idealized that island, filled it with the emotions of my carefree,\
  \ nine-year-old child mind.\nWhile staying on that island, I experienced  all the\
  \ beauty there is about Greece, about my Greece. From the small beaches on the seaside,\
  \ of the same light blue as the sky, to the little central town, the Xora, studded\
  \ with cubic houses. From the old fishermen,and Kostantinos, the landlord of our\
  \ house by the sea, from the children cackling through the town\u2019s streets,\
  \ to the days spent on the beach with my peers, to the Loux lemonades drunk with\
  \ my father.\nThat was the journey that made me fall in love with Greece and with\
  \ its little wonders. Sometimes I am afraid that if I came back to Lipsi, I would\
  \ find a different place. Sometimes I look back at those days. Simple, eternal days.\n\
  At morning we were fond of the crystalline sea, fond of the sun, fond of the salt\
  \ and the sand that tasted of Greece. We savored some cold dishes at  the bakery\
  \ of the town, where every day the owner, an old lady, was waiting for us, happy\
  \ to see some \u2018ital\xF2i\u2019, as she said to love Italy. In the evenings,\
  \ in Lipsi the sky was clean, clear and intoxicating, quiet, serene and exciting.\
  \ Every star in the sky shined for us. We were falling in love with that island,\
  \ every day more. Talking more and more with the people, eating \u2018mezedes\u2019\
  , feeling the smell of the \u2018ouzo\u2019, the sweet liqueur, forbidden to us\
  \ children, listening to the overwhelming music of the \u2018bouzouki\u2019 and\
  \ dancing to the \u2018syrtaki\u2019, music that was able to get everyone embraced\
  \ in the warm hug of the culture, the life and the people from that island, and\
  \ from the whole of Greece.\nNow, after ten years, I wonder: if I came back,  would\
  \ I be able to find all of this? Probably I would not.\nAnd so, I keep the images\
  \ of my Greece, musical ,colorful, wonderful, as I remember it."
