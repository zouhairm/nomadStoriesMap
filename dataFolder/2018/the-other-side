Text: "I call through the bars, to anyone who will listen, \u201CDoes anyone here\
  \ speak English?\u201D \u201CCan I use a phone? I need to make a phone call!\u201D\
  \  I don\u2019t know who I would call, definitely not home. \nA great painful silence\
  \ comes down and I step away from the bars. I desire fresh air. \nA homeless Parisian\
  \ tries to engage in the conversation half in French and half in English and surprisingly\
  \ the conversation is easy and relaxed, the kind of person the man comes across\
  \ as. \u201COffal, offal, offal\u2026\u201D he repeats shaking his head, for not\
  \ understanding why I am locked up. \nI stare at the homeless man. So Parisian.\
  \ So rustic and grotesque but still chic. \nI wonder if this absurd night in Paris\
  \ has changed me. \nI feel angry and betrayed at the outrageousness of it all, but\
  \ I should have known better than to venture out into the dark Paris night, trusting\
  \ a stranger to show me a vacant hotel room. He held me down, grasped my throat\
  \ and tightened his grip to the point where I ceased all the movement. Maybe I just\
  \ experienced a city where the perceived decadence and sleaze fuels violence.\n\
  I keep biting my dry lips. A drop of water would be great. I bet the homeless man's\
  \ stomach is growling. I wonder when he last had a plate of any type of food. A\
  \ dam of frustration inside me bursts. \u201CAwful, awful, awful\u2026\u201D I say.\
  \ I decide to yell through the bars one last time. This time I\u2019m copying the\
  \ man and his Parisian accent. \u201COffal!\u201D Homeless man smirks, corners of\
  \ his eyes crinkling. \nI step closer to him. He has probably lived three days in\
  \ one. I had one night of \u201Coffal\u201D and he has probably had a lifetime,\
  \ or at least a very long time. As I approach the man again, he mumbles something\
  \ in French and I imagine he is saying \u201CCome sit with me, no agenda... just\
  \ you and me talking about how strange the world is and what are we actually doing\
  \ here\u2026\u201D His voice is kind and the language barrier is not a problem.\
  \ Deep in conversation together, I find out that he used to work as a builder and\
  \ travelled the world. He comes from a big family. When discussing the topic of\
  \ life and future, his eyes lit up with ambition and optimism, he dreams of family\
  \ of his own one day. He has searched for work but ended up in the wrong crowd.\
  \ Times have been tough lately. He seems kind, gracious and endearing. Looking about\
  \ at the emptying cell, the beige walls look so dependable and neutral. I am suddenly\
  \ overwhelmed by it all."
