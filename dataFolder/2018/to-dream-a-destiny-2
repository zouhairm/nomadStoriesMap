Text: "My family never had much money. When I was eight years old, thanks to my father's\
  \ horrible financial expertise, our family took a trip to France. Everyone later\
  \ raved about how stupid the decision was and it was, but, truthfully? It changed\
  \ everything.\n   All of my life I've been a bit of an adventurer. As a kid I biked\
  \ the width and length of my hometown of about five thousand people almost everyday.\
  \ My moto was and, dare I say, always will be the saying by Robert Frost, \"I took\
  \ the road less traveled and that has made all of the difference.\" I was a loner,\
  \ a bookworm, an explorer of no-traspassing-zones and a young vegabond of the most\
  \ feferocious sort. Not all of that has changed about me but, I find though that\
  \ some of it has; I've come to know that every journey is all the better for the\
  \ people who you take it with.\n   So, there I stood on the extremely small balcony\
  \ of a hotel in the middle of Paris during the wakening hours of the city nightlife.\
  \ It was beautiful, ablaze with tantalizing life. As the lights twikled, I fell\
  \ in love.  And yet, as crisp cool fall breeze wafted up the three stories towards\
  \ me, it brought the smell of fresh food from the nearby cafe,the echoe of church\
  \ bells ringing somewhere in the midst of it all. In the middle of the noisy city,\
  \ it felt strange, almost foreign and yet, somehow peaceful. I promised myself then\
  \ that I would see it all again oneday, that my, broke, chubby,  introverted self,\
  \ would someday see the world."
