Text: "We were all standing in the sunset, the sky swallowing us, our minds not there,\
  \ really. All attention pulsated toward our electric screens with their prosthetic\
  \ limbs, capturing us only at our best angle, savoring all but the truth.\n\nWhen\
  \ I boarded the boat in Athens, Greece, I knew I was heading to Santorini. I saw\
  \ all the photos: the sunset reflecting off the ocean, the white-washed caves. I\
  \ had already put myself into those frames. But nobody warned me about the dystopian\
  \ island that I was sailing toward.\n\nMy first impression of Santorini was the\
  \ chaos. It was not so much due to the volume of people passing through; there was\
  \ something else going on. It was as though these people were not here for a relaxing\
  \ vacation. They had an important job to do and it seemed to involve their smart\
  \ phones.\n\nWhen I arrived in Oia, I sat on my balcony to enjoy the view. The orange\
  \ sky faded to a deep red as cries of a woman echoed in the air. It seemed that\
  \ she was disappointed by her ocean view suite; it did not live up to her presumably\
  \ Instagram-fueled expectations. Nothing could live up to mine, either.\n\nI started\
  \ to notice that it was not just the crying lady and I who were experiencing Santorini\
  \ syndrome. Every person I saw here was preoccupied with one thing: taking selfies.\
  \ Everyone, including myself, had the primary goal of capturing the moment, rather\
  \ than living in it.\n\nThere was a round of applause when the sun went down. The\
  \ sunset was beautiful, but I wasn\u2019t sure who we were giving our appreciation\
  \ to. This wasn\u2019t Disneyland, but it did have the overpriced gift shops, cheesy\
  \ photo-ops and the cheers and applauses, right on cue.\n\nThe shadows cast by that\
  \ famous Santorini sun represented something robotic: selfie sticks in the air,\
  \ we no longer looked human. We all expressed an urgent need to create propaganda.\
  \ Perhaps it was to justify the experience to ourselves and to our digital world.\
  \ Maybe we were all so disappointed in the reality of Santorini that we needed to\
  \ see it perfect again, through the convincing filter of our own camera lens.\n\n\
  I looked out to the ocean and felt a tinge of emptiness. I had become detached to\
  \ my surroundings, and this very real world felt void of a dimension in the absence\
  \ of a digital accomplice.\n\nI needed to accept all of this island; its beauty,\
  \ its flaws, its hidden culture, if I was to truly appreciate it. The richness of\
  \ travel lay in diversity, not perfection, all along. That\u2019s what Santorini\
  \ tried to make me forget."
