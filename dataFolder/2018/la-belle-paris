Text: "The last thing I expected to notice were the trees. Thinner and starker, even\
  \ on the white background of the snow-covered city of love, than any you could find\
  \ back home, yet more lively than any tree I'd seen in Oz.\n\nI'd just come from\
  \ Australia, Melbourne, 30 degree temperatures. I was at a party the night before,\
  \ dressed to the nines, now I was wearing 5 layers of clothing, and a face of growing\
  \ concern at the piercing cold I felt through the palm of my hands. \"Remember to\
  \ buy gloves\" I told myself, rubbing frenetically at the point where the dagger\
  \ of freezing cold air was entering my skin. The trees. Not like the eucalyptus\
  \ back home, or the tea tree. These were short, with plenty of branches, but not\
  \ a leaf in sight. A skeleton, covered with frost. They were perfect and picturesque,\
  \ and drove home for the first time that I was well and truly out of my home. It\
  \ wasn't the boarding of the airplane, or the take off. Not the landing nor the\
  \ bus ride into La Belle Paris, (the bus driver was about as crazy as any Australian\
  \ bus driver). No. The trees, beautiful and innocent, and perfect enough for any\
  \ impressionist painting; they caught my eye first.\n\n\nMy partner had been asking\
  \ me for the few weeks leading up to the trip if I was getting excited, was I ready\
  \ to go, had I packed already? No, was the answer to all of the above. But there,\
  \ standing in La place du Trocadero, gazing down at the gardens placed between myself\
  \ and the colossal sight that is The Eiffel Tower, growing ever more enchanted by\
  \ the snow, and the rows of neatly planted ash trees and red oaks, that my excitement\
  \ flourished. \n\nPersevering through the sleet that was now forming, I headed on\
  \ for a short stop at a \"quick\" (the french equivalent of McDonald's) before heading\
  \ to board the TGV to Nantes. Further still my excitement continued to prosper,\
  \ for as fast as the bullet train goes, it still had a massive distance to cover;\
  \ which gave me a little under two hours of charming french countryside to drool\
  \ over, and drool I did. Rolling hills gave way to hollow forests and the occasional\
  \ spontaneous village. Nantes had appeared rather quickly, much to my hatred at\
  \ having to end the screening of My Fair Farmland, but this feeling soon gave way\
  \ to wonder, as again I was taken aback by the sheer stunning character of the city\
  \ of Nantes. Just like Paris, Nantes was a beautiful combination of old and new.\
  \ But the trees, of all the beauty in the city, the last thing I expected were the\
  \ trees."
