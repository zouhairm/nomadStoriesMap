Text: "Not only have I gained a greater appreciation for my lifestyle and blessings,\
  \ but genuinely will immerse myself into causes that help ease the poverty and maintain\
  \ conservational efforts abroad. I had not realized how many things I was afraid\
  \ of and never tried before, due to how uncomfortable the mere thought was, until\
  \ this trip. I got over my fear of swimming in large bodies of water when we swam\
  \ in the ocean, swam and canoed in the Sibun River, went water tubing, swam in waterfalls\
  \ after two long hikes, and the magnificent Blue Hole. I overcame my fear of the\
  \ dark many times in the bunks without light at night, and mainly when we went on\
  \ a night hike in the jungle, with the Howler Monkeys howling as loud as ever, with\
  \ owls and snakes hiding about.\nEvery time I flew in an airplane I marveled out\
  \ the window and never thought much about it.\n Now, being 20 years old and figuring\
  \ out my path and purpose in life, I looked out my tiny airplane window and really\
  \ thought about how insignificant one really feels in the quarrel of this world,\
  \ but especially when flying above it.\nAnd after this trip, this idea had really\
  \ morphed and embedded in my mentality, this was exacerbated after seeing the poverty,\
  \ and often helpless situations we saw the citizens in. The people of Belize face\
  \ excruciating circumstances but remain so humble and content- something the first-world\
  \ could really learn from.  While we were hiking my friends encouraged me to keep\
  \ going, shared water, they encouraged me to swim beneath waterfalls, and kept me\
  \ well entertained. As a heavily devoted science person, it seems that our work\
  \ in labs and the practical implications seem so far and untouchable in our daily\
  \ routines-- I have come to realize the complete opposite. I never thought my various\
  \ interests being an EMT, pharmacy technician, and my passion for trauma and emergency\
  \ medicine could share a space with my genuine care for animals and environmental\
  \ causes. Yet, I had come to find out about the internships and opportunities in\
  \ Belize and other 3rd world countries for doctors and the sort to work and live.\
  \ Before this trip, this idea seemed unrealistic and risky, now it seems only natural.\
  \ Belize is definitely a county I wish to visit again, but not only as a tourist\
  \ and student, but a scientific researcher and hopefully, a medical doctor."
