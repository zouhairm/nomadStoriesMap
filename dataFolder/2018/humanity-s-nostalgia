Text: "The cool grey of the steel canopy soared above me as I left the last gallery,\
  \ the perforations allowing a cascade of light to create a dynamic balance of natural\
  \ and man-made geometry. The ceiling hovered above the white cubic structures beneath\
  \ it, seemingly as light as the fronds of palm trees. The archipelago\u2019s courtyard\
  \ opened to a maze of smaller walkways ending in sets of descending steps around\
  \ which the water of the Arabian Gulf lapped. The Louvre Abu Dhabi is the latest\
  \ cultural development on Saadiyat Island - just off the main island of the UAE\u2019\
  s capital - recently opened in November of 2017, whose architect is the word-renowned\
  \ Jean Nouvel. With 12 galleries amounting to 8000 square metres of exhibition space,\
  \ it is the largest art museum in the Arabian Peninsula.\n\nIt was with an almost\
  \ zealous excitement that I came with during my visit, because not only was its\
  \ quickly garnered fame rooted in its architecture, but also in its art and exhibits\
  \ that spanned a timeline of humanity. Walking from gallery to gallery, I was brought\
  \ from the early beginnings of civilization to modern art, all represented by pieces\
  \ retrieved from various cultures. Socrates\u2019 pondering marble head, a serene\
  \ Egyptian sarcophagus, and an enigmatic dancing Shiva from India, formed a m\xE9\
  lange with the clear strokes of van Gogh\u2019s self-portrait, Monet\u2019s hazy\
  \ pastel depiction of La Gare Saint-Lazare, and the black and white frenzy of a\
  \ Jackson Pollock. My fascination grew. Amongst the exhibits rode a glorious Napoleon,\
  \ sat a content George Washington, and lay a studious young emir, all bringing to\
  \ me a picture of humanity unlike any other, a collection of colour and form expressing\
  \ a multi-faceted, ubiquitous existence.\n\nFor myself, museums hardly represent\
  \ a thrilling experience, but this one was different. Looking out from the galleries\u2019\
  \ windows, the teal water shimmering against the white and grey of the many facades,\
  \ the crowd\u2019s murmur surrounding me, I felt this elusive thrill, as though\
  \ I was captured by the various expressions of religious and artistic inspiration\
  \ painting a picture of humanity\u2019s chronology that I never expected to be possible.\
  \ I was compelled to follow this path, to relive moments, to change the way I viewed\
  \ exhibits between galleries, to look through the eyes of those who came before\
  \ me. As I entered the main courtyard under the dome, into the cool winter breeze,\
  \ I realized there was still much to come.\n\nPerhaps I still have a chance as an\
  \ artist."
