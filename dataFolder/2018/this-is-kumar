Text: "It\u2019s three in the morning. I haven\u2019t slept for twenty-four hours.\
  \ The airport is blurry; a two-day shirt has leeched itself to my back. Someone\
  \ is meant to be meeting me here. They must be late.\nAnd then, through the gloom\
  \ and the thick soupy air, I spot a figure waving in my direction. I look around\
  \ but there is no one else to be seen. He waves again. I start staggering, curiously,\
  \ towards him.\n \u2018Yes my son!\u2019 shouts the man in a voice made of sandpaper.\
  \ \u2018Come with me, Kumar is here for you!\u2019\nThe man has a toothbrush moustache\
  \ and is dressed immaculately in a white shirt, black trousers, and shoes that shine\
  \ like polished brass. He wrestles my bags off me and takes them to the car himself.\
  \ \nI notice he is missing his two front teeth. I tell him that I lost mine a few\
  \ years back too. \u2018Ah yes but you have smart new ones. I could never do that\
  \ my son because, look \u2013\u2018 he puts his fingers in the gap between his canines\
  \ and blows a raspberry, \u2018they are just too funny!\u2019\nThis was my first\
  \ impression of the man I was to spend the next few weeks with. This was Kumar.\n\
  \nKumar would start each day the same way: head bowed, eyes closed, hands clasped\
  \ together.\nHe was a deeply religious man but life had not always been kind to\
  \ him. He lost his house in the tsunami of 2005. \u2018Every day Sri Lankans face\
  \ risk- it is who we are.\u2019 Kumar\u2019s wife was unhappy at him and his children\
  \ were struggling at school. He, like everyone else in the world, had his own problems.\n\
  But over the coming weeks we discovered that we had things in common beyond simply\
  \ this. He liked the Beatles and so did I; he loved mangoes and so did I; he thought\
  \ that my generation was too quick to give-up and so did I. \nHe liked to talk about\
  \ my future but I would just shrug. He asked me what I liked doing and I said drinking\
  \ wine. \u2018Aha!\u2019 he exploded, cracking into a smile, \u2018so maybe you\
  \ go to France, and I can come and help!\u2019 He loved to talk of this plan as\
  \ we tucked into curries by the road.\nHe was still talking about it three weeks\
  \ later when we said goodbye at the airport, and as I turned to leave, I noticed\
  \ that he had tears in his eyes.\n\nA month later it\u2019s midnight in London.\
  \ The air is full of champagne and kisses. My phone vibrates: an unrecognised number.\
  \ Happy New Year my son, wishing you good health and joy, it reads. The phone may\
  \ not recognise the man behind the message, but I sure do. This is Kumar: 63 years\
  \ to my 23; Sri Lankan to my English; believer to my agnostic; yet a friend to a\
  \ friend."
