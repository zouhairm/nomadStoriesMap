Text: "With Myanmar\u2019s relatively recent emancipation from Junta rule, Mrauk U\
  \ is a secret within a secret. Venturing 22 hours by bus from Bagan, Myanmar\u2019\
  s preeminent location, we traversed monsoon laden villages bypassing Tatmadaw (Myanmar\u2019\
  s military) bases with the occasional and much needed remote rest stop in the early\
  \ hours. We also passed through Rohingya villages. We were in Rakhine State, the\
  \ epicentre of Myanmar\u2019s ethnic cleansing campaign against its western Muslim\
  \ minority. This was also August 25th 2017, the day of a border attack which sparked\
  \ the current refugee crisis. The suffering isn\u2019t visible from the road, but\
  \ you know it\u2019s there. The decision to visit here was made to explore the rarely\
  \ touched landscape, and to learn about this crisis at a ground zero level. \n\n\
  Mrauk U rests deep within Rakhine State and polarises Bagan in its entirety. Rounded\
  \ pagodas dot the rolling hills of this jungle landscape, of which could best be\
  \ described as Easter Island intertwined with Indiana Jones, with many an underground\
  \ catacomb aligned with deities to boast. This is a long way from the red brick\
  \ Pagodas of Bagan and the gold of Yangon. Meticulous Buddha carvings line the walls\
  \ of the mossy interiors, with glimmers of light divinely spotlighting the centuries\
  \ old centrestage Buddhas. Farmers work their powerful water-buffalo on landscapes\
  \ saturated green with paddy fields, beautifully contrasting the charcoal pagodas\
  \ edging homes, hotels, schools and every other shred of modern normality. An empire\
  \ once ruled from here. Now accessible, fewer than five thousand foreigners are\
  \ believed to arrive annually. \n\nThis former capital of a kingdom which was once\
  \ a port of call for European merchants provides an experience invoking feelings\
  \ akin to being a country\u2019s first explorers, disregard wifi entirely! \n\n\
  This restive town also however generates a sinister reminder of what\u2019s at stake\
  \ behind the beauty. Certain locals will tell you that Rakhine isn\u2019t safe for\
  \ foreigners due to ongoing conflict, and when pressed for answers will voice their\
  \ support for the Tatmadaw\u2019s operations against the \u2018Bengali immigrants,\u2019\
  \ a slur for the Rohingya. This is in spite of Rakhine\u2019s neglect from Naypyidaw\u2019\
  s investment, compounding the ethnic fractions which have haunted Myanmar since\
  \ independence.\n\nBidding Mrauk U farewell before ferrying the Kaladan River to\
  \ Sittwe, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder if the finally publicised Rohingya crisis\
  \ would sink the town back into the untraversed."
