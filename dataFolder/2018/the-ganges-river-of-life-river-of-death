Text: "We don\u2019t do death well in the West. I reflect, as I stand in the pastel\
  \ pre-dawn light, on the worn steps of the bathing Ghats, the sacred Ganges river,\
  \ watery home of the Goddess Ganga, at my feet. I\u2019m in Varanasi, India - one\
  \ of the oldest living cities on the planet, spiritual home of Hindus and a place\
  \ of pilgrimage for all.\n\nA year before my father had passed away from melanoma,\
  \ refusing treatment, he died a year after diagnosis. We cared for him at home -\
  \ my mother, brother and I, until the last days of his life, when he entered palliative\
  \ care, we remained with him. I was unpractised in how to care for a dying loved\
  \ one. My heart broke, I was humbled, and it was an immense privilege, to support\
  \ my father, who had given me so much, to die. Still, I couldn\u2019t shake the\
  \ feeling that in this information obsessed world, with google and apps galore,\
  \ I should have understood more about death.\n\nAround me, activity is building,\
  \ families of pilgrims are getting ready to bathe, as am I. Bells tinkle, groups\
  \ chant softly, chai places establish themselves for the day, holy trinkets stalls\
  \ are assembled, shrines, grand and simple, are being tended with devotion and boat\
  \ men are preparing for the day ahead. \nDressed in a one-piece swimming costume,\
  \ with a sarong wrapped under my armpits and reaching below my knees for modesty,\
  \ I continue down the steps, worn by the feet of millions of pilgrims, into mother\
  \ Ganga\u2019s wintry water. Casting aside nagging concerns about cleanliness, I\
  \ close my eyes tight, hold my nose and dunk under- one, two, three, four, five\
  \ - times as the ritual decrees.\n\nExhilarated, I pause to absorb the experience\
  \ into my being. If feels profound and personal, public and shared. As I retreat\
  \ to dry and dress the impossibly large, redder than red sun, ascends in the pale\
  \ blue sky over the water and the sounds of the daily morning aarti ceremony begin.\n\
  \nDrinking hot, spicy, sweet chai, my heart uplifted and at peace, I ponder that\
  \ the last thing I was expecting was for the grief that arose within me, from my\
  \ fathers death, to be soothed by bathing in the Ganges and for me to vow that from\
  \ now on, every time I was faced with great grief in my life, I would venture back\
  \ here. Hindu cremations take place in burning Ghats along the river, here a trinket\
  \ seller tells me that the \u2018learning is in the burning\u2019. The city of Shiva,\
  \ the destructor and creator had transformed me, understanding death had allowed\
  \ me to live just that little bit more."
