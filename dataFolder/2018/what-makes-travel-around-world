Text: "One of the traveling benefits is finding and keeping humility. Too often, people\
  \ get wrapped up in their lives, their daily routine of working, sleeping, eating\
  \ and living. They become self-absorbed to the point it affects their health, their\
  \ happiness, and their perspectives\nIt\u2019s a great, big world out there with\
  \ billions and billions of people, who each day live their life and have their own\
  \ unique experiences. \nTravel reminds those paying attention that they are not\
  \ the only ship in the sea, that this is a huge world and that they are only a small,\
  \ insignificant pea in it. This is quite a humbling experience \u2013 to go to another\
  \ country and see large numbers of peoples living differently, and coming to understand\
  \ how large the crazy world actually is. When people who learn return home, they\
  \ keep with them this perspective for the rest of their life and they benefit from\
  \ this is knowledge and perspective.\nAnother benefit to traveling is coming to\
  \ see one\u2019s native country in a different light, in a different way. This is\
  \ done through being able to compare and contrast home from a foreign location,\
  \ done most always through traveling. A new perspective may be forme One does not\
  \ understand what it means to be a citizen of their native country until they have\
  \ seen it from a distance, from another, completely different country. When traveling\
  \ elsewhere and having to live according to a foreign place\u2019s laws and social\
  \ norms, one immediately thinks of how things are done in their own country and\
  \ culture and begins to favor one way or another. This changes how one feels about\
  \ their native country, whether in a better or worse light. This notion can be applied\
  \ to various characteristics, such women\u2019s rights, human rights, customs and\
  \ traditions, beliefs, a trust of government, etc. Traveling is always beneficial\
  \ for the individual experiencing it.\nAnother great benefit to traveling is the\
  \ life experience. Many people in the world do not have the luxury of going to another\
  \ country for pleasure, or even to another city in their native country for that\
  \ matter This forces them to be adventurous, to live life to the fullest, to take\
  \ the most of this precious gift of life and use the time they have to discover\
  \ new things, meet new people and experience a completely different life"
