Text: "Being a third generation American is a funny feeling. All of my life there\u2019\
  s been a transparent wisp of the old world hovering. I could smell Greece in my\
  \ grandmother\u2019s old linen table cloths, I could hear it in the rumble of my\
  \ Papou\u2019s baritone echoing through the house as he made strong kafe in the\
  \ kitchen. I could taste it in the remnants of delicious feasts I licked off of\
  \ my childhood fingers (cinnamon, feta, olive oil, mint, basil, rosemary). My family\
  \ history originated in the grainy, coffee colored photographs of pinched faces\
  \ from places with names I couldn\u2019t pronounce. I pictured Greece, as a child,\
  \ as extensions of these photos: a two dimensional dream land where people glared\
  \ through harsh lighting and the brown fuzzy hills extended into infinities in all\
  \ directions. \n But something about this place called to me, like I\u2019d inherited\
  \ the memories of my ancestors along with their uncontrollable hair. I found myself,\
  \ twelve years old, crammed in the back of a tiny rental car with too many of my\
  \ Greek American relatives. All knees and elbows, we jostled through the tight turns\
  \ of cobblestones alleyways, my Papou retracing an old route worn into him with\
  \ no street signs for guidance. We tumbled out and into a tiny apartment, where\
  \ two wrinkled figures ran to us. They were tiny, tiny, people. A man and woman,\
  \ miniatures next to my families\u2019 touristy polo shirts, practical sandals,\
  \ 6 ft statures. They led us indoors by the hand, urgently sifting through the tiny\
  \ pantry for cookies, biscuits, every food item they had. With crinkly-skinned fingers,\
  \ the woman tugged me toward a framed picture in the middle of the mantle, and my\
  \ eyes widened.\n A photo from a few years ago, Christmas, my family sitting stiffly\
  \ next to a mall Santa. Our hair neater than it ever appeared in life, our clothing\
  \ uncharacteristically ironed. How ludicrous it looked in this room, with its earth\
  \ colored walls, the way the stones stayed tumbled together, the delicate lace table\
  \ cloths. Our neon puffy jackets, the shiny Christmas tree in the background, a\
  \ plastic-y lite brite beaming world; I imagined where she thought we came from.\
  \ \nIn the same way that my own vision of Greece extended from fuzzy, fractured\
  \ images, her vision of the United States must come from that photo. We were both\
  \ looking through squinted portals between our worlds, building out a landscape\
  \ from a snapshot."
