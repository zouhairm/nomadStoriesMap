Text: "Since long time ago I wanted to save money to be able to travel around Europe,\
  \ but sometimes it is difficult to live alone, pay the rent, and save money. So\
  \ it I was taking more time than usual. And on top of everithing the person who\
  \ rented me the department where I live tells me that she can't rent me anymore\
  \ because she will sell the same. This meant that I had to invest al my savings\
  \ in a new department. So all my efforts had been in vain, I thought. But the fate\
  \ had prepared me a little surprise, because my brother one day appears in my house\
  \ and tells me that he will gift me the flight ticket to Europe that long I've been\
  \ wishing. I didn't think twice, I overcame my fears, I accept the gift, quit my\
  \ job, put my stuff in a garage and pack my clothes to travel around Europe. And\
  \ so far it's been the best experience of my life. I have been in Europe for 2 months\
  \ and have visited some cities of Spain, Portugal and France. Which I have loved\
  \ for the ir history, culture, people and food. Each one is different and magical\
  \ at the same time. But where I've spending more time is in Par\xEDs. What a beautiful\
  \ city!!! Although it is winter and I have a very rainy climate, I can't stop to\
  \ know and get marvel for its buildings, museums, monuments and all that exist.\
  \ I look like a little girl who has been given her best birthday gifts but I can't\
  \ help stop enjoying everything I see and do.  I love the tours guide that tells\
  \ the story of each building or munumento or place you go. Knowing the story there\
  \ is behind everything I find it fascinating. Living with the parisians it's very\
  \ nice too, they tend to be more respectful than in other countries and although\
  \ sometimes they could has an angry face if you ask them for their help or try to\
  \ speak in their language they are willing to help you. I still have cities to visit,\
  \ before I leave. Place to know and experiences to learn from. This trip showed\
  \ me how wonderful it's travel to me and I realized that now that I started I don't\
  \ know if I'm going to be able to stop. And that's why I running for this experience,\
  \ because learning to be a travel writer will open up me the possibility to continue\
  \ traveling, to live on it and share with others the travel experiences I have made.\
  \ Because when you share your travel experience with others, although they don't\
  \ travel with you, those experiences are enjoyed more. So I did it, I start to travel\
  \ and I don't want to stop!!!"
