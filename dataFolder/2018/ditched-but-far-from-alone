Text: "\u201CHow did I end up here?\u201D I despair. I\u2019m sitting on the rooftop\
  \ of my hostel in Hoi An, Vietnam. With my head in my hands, the glistening lights\
  \ of this beguiling ancient town are lost on me.\n\nAbout 5 minutes ago my dorm\
  \ mate Sharna came blustering into our room with a greaseball attached to her face.\
  \ Stay in a hostel, they said. You\u2019ll meet people, they said. It\u2019s been\
  \ a rollercoaster getting here, and I\u2019m not even halfway through my trip.\n\
  \nFour nights ago, I landed in Ho Chi Minh. It\u2019s hot \u2014 the heat is definitely\
  \ on in Saigon. It\u2019s perilous trying to cross the road here. Scooters hold\
  \ dominion, weaving through traffic in a mesmerising dance of death. I\u2019m immediately\
  \ swept up in its frenzy, ready for an adventure with my friend El.\n\nWhat happened\
  \ next left me shaken, angry, but mostly just afraid.\n\nIt turns out El\u2019s\
  \ changed her mind. Turns out she\u2019s made a mistake and wants to go home. Panic\
  \ begins to unfurl its horrible fingers and creep through my body. I wasn\u2019\
  t expecting this.\n\nWHAT? But\u2026we\u2019ve just arrived. I thought she loved\
  \ travelling? How can I possibly do this on my own?\n\nMy mum has always been unfalteringly\
  \ proactive. Naturally, I call her. \u201CI can\u2019t do this\u201D, I weep. She\
  \ tells me that of course I can (are you sure?), that I\u2019ve been through worse\
  \ (have I?) and that I should continue the trip, perhaps just differently than planned\
  \ (how?). \u201CDon\u2019t let this experience go to waste, possum. Cancel your\
  \ bookings. I\u2019ll find some hostels for you, so you can meet people.\u201D\n\
  \nSo, Proactive Mum saves the day, bolstering me on, without El, to Hoi An, where\
  \ I find myself on a rooftop, once again questioning whether I can do this on my\
  \ own.\n\nIf only I knew what was coming. I\u2019d see that the worst was almost\
  \ behind me. I\u2019d see myself finding a strength I didn\u2019t know I had. I\u2019\
  d see myself sipping on traditional Vietnamese coffee in what was to become my favourite\
  \ city, Hanoi. I\u2019d see myself staring wide-eyed at the stunning natural beauty\
  \ of Ha Long Bay. And I\u2019d realise I was no longer afraid of being alone because\
  \ of the incredible kindness and generosity of strangers. There was Marie and Jess,\
  \ the dynamic mother/daughter duo who asked me to sit at their table for dinner\
  \ every night. There was soft spoken Chris who chased me down the street with his\
  \ contact details in case I was ever in Stockholm. There was Helen and Mike from\
  \ Melbourne who let me join them on a bike ride. And there were so many more. They\
  \ probably thought nothing of it, but to me it was everything."
