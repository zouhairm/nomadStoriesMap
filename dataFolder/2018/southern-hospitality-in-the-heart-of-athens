Text: "I traveled to Greece in 2008 with a group of college students. At soon as the\
  \ plane landed, I immediately felt overwhelmed by culture shock. It took me a  half\
  \ hour to find the restroom symbol, and another fifteen minutes to figure out how\
  \ to flush the toilet. Little did I know that this would be the least intimidating\
  \ part of the trip. Each day, it took our group about two hours to get to the university.\
  \ We were taught to hide our money and passports inside of our clothes to avoid\
  \ the pickpockets. One passenger wasn\u2019t so lucky; when the doors swung open\
  \ at a stop, a small boy leapt onto the bus and tried to grab her purse. She was\
  \ quicker and snatched him by the arm. She began to beat him viciously, shouting\
  \ at him in Greek. Eventually the child wrenched himself free and fled the bus empty-handed.\
  \ Once at the university, our eyes immediately noticed the beautiful statues of\
  \ Athena and other Olympians; however, many of the white statues were tarnished\
  \ with graffiti, mostly anarchist symbols. Charred cars and sides of buildings were\
  \ not uncommon, and several students were crowded around red and yellow Soviet Union\
  \ flags. After about an hour, more students appeared and we found ourselves in the\
  \ midst of a riot. We quickly left the university and began our journey back to\
  \ Kifisia where we would spend the night. Eventually we made it \u201Chome\u201D\
  \ to the Scripture Union, which was a hostel-like dwelling run by the local church.\
  \ When it came time for dinner, we filed into a small room with folding chairs and\
  \ tables. Several Greek women were in a nearby kitchen, occasionally bringing out\
  \ casseroles and salads to set on a long table at the front of the room. As we walked\
  \ down the table with our empty plates, the women smiled graciously at us. Generously\
  \ portions of pastitio steamed from our dishes, and the smell of homemade lemon\
  \ vinaigrette wafted up from true Greek salads. Several students from the local\
  \ church sat with us and talked with us as best as they could in English. Each day\
  \ that followed looked very similar to the first. After the stress of traveling\
  \ and oftentimes fear of what we would encounter at the university, we couldn\u2019\
  t wait to return home to a warm meal and a loving community. Having lived in the\
  \ Southern US for several years, it was easy for me to compare the compassion I\
  \ was shown to the unique hospitality of a southern host. While I wasn\u2019t expecting\
  \ these interactions to be the highlight of my trip, they easily left the greatest\
  \ impression on me."
