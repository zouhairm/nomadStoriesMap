Text: "It\u2019s midday and we\u2019re on a devil\u2019s ride. Off to see Bohol\u2019\
  s Chocolate Hills, on a predictable path of first-time visitors to the Philippines,\
  \ we have angered the one person that we should have been on good terms with \u2013\
  \ our driver. \nLike two shocked ladies in a silent movie, we sit in the shaky,\
  \ rusty tricycle with gaping mouths and terror in non-blinking eyes, clutching to\
  \ our backpacks. Up the bumpy road, in clouds of dust and gasoline fumes, our driver\
  \ gestures at passing motorcycles, zigzags passionately, takes turns like Ayrton\
  \ Senna \u2013 all at full speed and with approximately half a thumb distance to\
  \ other vehicles. Ten minutes in, we lose our cool. \n\u201CAny chance you could\
  \ slow down?\u201D, I yell between squeaks, looking at the road through my fingers.\
  \ \n\u201CYou don\u2019t want to get to the Hills?\u201D, he is surprised. Yes,\
  \ but staying alive matters too, I reply in my mind. \nAs we visibly freak out,\
  \ he throws us more confused looks, and the tension in the tiny vehicle can now\
  \ be cut with a knife. \nWhen did we become such panic-stricken crybabies?\nThe\
  \ truth is, we\u2019ve been in Southeast Asia for a few weeks already, but the Zen\
  \ attitude of Buddhist countries has not prepared us for Philippines\u2019 intensity.\
  \ The serene beauty of Palawan or Boracay is unmatched, yet the poverty in the backyard\
  \ of resorts full of margarita-marinated tourists is shattering. Dramatic rock ballads\
  \ of 80\u2019s bands, beloved by Filipino bus drivers, are a score well-suited to\
  \ this land of contrasts. When we embark on our Bohol tour, leaving behind another\
  \ harbor full of skinny, wide-eyed kids, the emotion, chaos and noise of the past\
  \ few days finally get to us. Our driver is its unlucky victim. \nSuddenly the tricycle\
  \ slows down and pulls to the side, squeaking like us a moment ago. First I am relieved,\
  \ but then I realize that being stranded halfway through the drive is not good either.\
  \ Our driver smiles. Well, if I were him, I\u2019d be happy to get rid of us too.\
  \ \nHe reaches for something next to our feet, flashing his rubber Duterte bracelet,\
  \ and gets out to the roadside as we watch confused. \n\u201CHere,\u201D he offers\
  \ us a warm bottle of soda. His smile is genuine, highlighting wrinkles around his\
  \ eyes. We barely communicate, yet he somehow senses that our panic during the ride\
  \ was not only about his speed racing. I feel silly as I take the bottle and watch\
  \ him calmly smoke. \nBack in the tricycle, we admire the lush forest around us,\
  \ finally letting the driver do his job. He gets us safely to the Hills."
