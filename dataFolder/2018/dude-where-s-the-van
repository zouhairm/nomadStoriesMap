Text: "I had not anticipated gazing upon Frances alpine jewel, Mont Blanc, and thinking,\
  \ \"Damn, my hands are cold.\" It was minus 25-degree\u2019s and my repugnance at\
  \ the thought of a glove budget had sullied my experience. Like many in their early\
  \ 20's, my globe-trotting dreams had become reality, but that reality isn't always\
  \ as envisioned. For instance, at the foot of the mountain, a cozy double bed awaited\
  \ my return. The cruel irony being it was in the back of a Red Transit Van and my\
  \ dad, Gary, was behind the wheel.\n\nThree years prior, we experienced the shock\
  \ of another cold grip. Cancer had taken my mother, his beloved wife, leaving us\
  \ shivering in the aftermath. Being nineteen at the time I was resilient, but dad\
  \ stuck to his routine, only with more beer and no one to drink with. The mustached\
  \ joker I knew and loved was in a rut, and it forced my hand. For Christmas, I surprised\
  \ him with a ticket to the unknown.\n\nThe French Alps were my idea, but Rome had\
  \ his curiosity. \"What do Romans actually do?\" It was an eight-hour journey from\
  \ the French/Italian border, so we broke the trip in two, spending the night in\
  \ Lido Di Camaiore. Our initial judgment was of a quiet seaside town lining the\
  \ Mediterranean Sea. We were wrong.\n\nI awoke to some facts. \u201CDid you know\
  \ there are building\u2019s in Rome that are older than Jesus?\u201D enquired Gaz.\
  \ I didn\u2019t, but it was refreshing to know he knew how to google. With purpose,\
  \ we burst onto the street, instantly confronted by a bustling sea of lycra. Somehow,\
  \ we had missed the sign-postings of the \u201CTirreno Adriatico Cycling Race\u201D\
  , an elite road cycling event. Amidst the chaos, I caught dad's eye. In shock, he\
  \ uttered, \u201CDude, where\u2019s the van?\"\n\nI panicked. We don\u2019t have\
  \ time to play illiterate detective. Was it stolen? Surely not. After all, we had\
  \ parked in the way of a World Championship Race. \u201CInglese?\u201D I begged\
  \ of any figure of authority, our stress peaking as we remembered the van was registered\
  \ in a friend's name. \u201CCi, Yes\u201D I heard from a local police-woman as she\
  \ herded traffic. Anxiously I asked, \u201CDo you know anything about a red van\
  \ with English plates?\u201D\n\nAfter five hours of google translate, a thorough\
  \ analysis of our paperwork and a reasonable fine, we escaped the police lot. To\
  \ this day, when we tell people about our trip through Europe, we don\u2019t start\
  \ with the highlights of Rome. We lead with dad\u2019s rendition of \u201CAmore\u201D\
  \ by Dean Martin. \u201CWhen the cops pinch your car, but they don\u2019t take it\
  \ far - Camaiore!\u201D"
