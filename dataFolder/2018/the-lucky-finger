Text: "In the middle of a cold August night in Santiago, Chile, my tribe and I were\
  \ huddled in a hostel trying to figure out how to cross the ludicrous desert of\
  \ Atacama. Someone from the hostel suggested, \u201CPorque no hacen dedo?\u201D\
  \ This translates to, \u201CWhy don\u2019t you do finger.\u201D But, before we could\
  \ get offended, the concierge explained that\u2019s the Chilean expression for hitchhiking.\
  \ \nIt sounded outlandish at first. Where we come from, hitchhiking is not a safe\
  \ practice, but for this foreign land, it seemed to be the norm.  Atacama, on the\
  \ other hand is the driest desert in the world, between the Andes Mountains and\
  \ the Chilean Costal range, making it a death zone for vegetation. However, in the\
  \ middle of every other winter it transforms into a beautiful garden, known as the\
  \ flowering desert. Thousands of flowers bloom all over the sands, alluring you\
  \ with their colorful displays. We settled on the idea, yearning to dance amongst\
  \ the magical flowers, and undertook this new challenge with the backpacking spirit\
  \ as wind in our sails. \nOur quest began the moment we left the hostel. Despite\
  \ our optimism, the hours were long and the cars were few. After much walking, crossing\
  \ and waiting we began to question if this \u201Cdedo\u201D idea work at all?  I\
  \ was starting to lose hope when a semi truck pulled over. Really?  We ran, as fast\
  \ as we could, I think hoping to reach the truck before the driver got second thoughts.\
  \ As we approached the passenger door, there he was listening to Cumbia and cheerfully\
  \ waiting for his guests to arrive. As we climbed in, our host asked with a grin\
  \ \u201CCan I trust you?\u201D We laughed, and felt we could rely on him, you see,\
  \ in the desert you learn to listen to your instincts. \nHis name was Mario, a sweet\
  \ truck driver that\u2019s been crossing the Atacama for the last twenty years.\
  \ He was happy to take us across and show us the wonders of this place.  In Atacama,\
  \ all you can see through the windows are vast stretches of gold sand, an immeasurable\
  \ amount of both beauty, and loneliness that touched every part of my being. We\
  \ drove for hours, sharing food, stories and laughs.  \nJust as the sun began to\
  \ kiss the sand, Mario pulled over a dazzling field of flowers. We\u2019d made it.\
  \  There in this sacred garden, I picked a flower for my hair and smiled thankfully.\
  \  Our lives can seem dry and harsh at times but, just like this desert, beauty\
  \ is always at the end of the road. I hugged Mario with gratitude, before he drove\
  \ away, and we prepared our lucky finger once again."
