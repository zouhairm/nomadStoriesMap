Text: "I closed my eyes searching in the scent of unknown the eternal path to home\
  \ I had never found.  Yet with each strange breeze of rewashed bedsheets, I sensed\
  \ its proximity stronger.\nThat dawn I woke up in Saharian winter, on an island\
  \ in Macaronesia. The volcano was silently breathing through ruthless black rocks\
  \ that were dispersing into the dark blue ocean. The forgotten sea village nestled\
  \ in the banana fields was empty that early morning, and everything was in a deep\
  \ sleep.  Spain, the old conqueror was retired, resting in tranquility. Only few\
  \ local anglers were peacefully embarking their small wooden boats. The sun, as\
  \ if rising from within the crater, illuminated the sky and Teide majestically shone\
  \ in sharp light above its island. \n I knew it was time to go.\nThe wavy road was\
  \ steep and crystal azure sky was defenselessly heating up, enhancing the translucent\
  \ green shrubs and cacti surviving intense drought.\n\u2018\u2019Where the sun will\
  \ disappear and darkness will appear, there you will find Magec\u2019\u2019, the\
  \ angler\u2019s words echoed.  Unsure of whom exactly I was looking for, or how\
  \ to find him, I knew I had no choice.  \nMissing the road indications, the world\
  \ around me shifted into an unevenly scattered pine forest on a bright orange soil.\
  \ The air was cooler and thinner. The volcano Teide had changed its shape; I had\
  \ to be on the right road. \nSurreal, puffy clouds covered panorama and I was descending\
  \ other side of the island. The permanent sun vanished and and humid, thick, dark\
  \ clouds blurred my vision.  I saw nothing anymore. \nMagec?  It was silent and\
  \ nobody on the road, just the spirit of nature observing me from every corner.\
  \ \nDark, juicy leaves began to flash in the fog and I saw the road again.\n I drove\
  \ down to the historical village of Guaranchico leaning my body onto a giant window\
  \ of a bank. People like phantoms were swimming in the sea in eternal spring, on\
  \ everlasting holidays, in perpetual bliss. \nI did not find Magec. Bound to wander\
  \ for eternity, I felt the rigid, known, pain gush into my veins.  I looked up for\
  \ the last time in desperate hope to see Magec, yet all I was able to see was sunray\
  \ cutting the clouds and shining directly onto me. Blinding me, I instinctively\
  \  turned around.\n My eyes fixed on the big letters the window of the local bank\
  \ was plastered with: WELCOME HOME!\nAghast I read those words over and over again.\
  \ I leaned onto the window closing my eyes.\nMagec is a Spirit. I must be dead.\
  \ This island is heaven and I am home at last."
