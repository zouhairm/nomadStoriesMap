  Para: Ser Oli Sapphire \nAsunto: Edited Version 1 \n\nThe afternoon began, as did\
  \ our trip. We saw Sorata below. The little town seemed very awake. There were totem\
  \ figures drawn in the mountains, and that day Sorata was celebrating. A band of\
  \ trumpets and drums was playing in the main square, and we listened from above\
  \ to the hits and howls as they came toward us and retreated away. The clouds began\
  \ to overlap the hoary mane of Mount Illamp\xFA, and a giant rainbow appeared, unlike\
  \ any other I had seen. A few meters to the right, another rainbow appeared, an\
  \ almost-transparent inverted reflection of the first. My eyes looked to the valleys\
  \ and mountains, but I saw a different reality. It was as if the soul of the place\
  \ had physically materialized, and I was standing face to face with it. The soul\
  \ of those mountains and those valleys and those rivers. Far away, the trees rose\
  \ from the place to which they had been fixed and began to walk, climbing the mountains\
  \ as if on their way to an extraordinary meeting that was to occur just over the\
  \ peak. \n\nEverything was new and strange. I laid down and my body fused with the\
  \ grass. I closed my eyes and saw ancestors and spirits from the woods and warrior\
  \ gods with feathers on their head and swords in their hands. The sound emanating\
  \ from the band below mixed into everything. The mountain vibrated and became a\
  \ messenger between earth and heaven. The band started to play as we were climbing\
  \ to the top of Iri Napi, invoking the clouds. The music went on loudly for hours.\
  \ It called to the clouds and the grass became moist. Clouds came from everywhere,\
  \ like honey seeping into cracks, pooling, gathering, making everything small. There\
  \ in the clouds, we tried to unravel newly arisen enigmas, and became lost in silences\
  \ filled with caressing leaves. The drummers and trumpeters had taken a break to\
  \ drink and celebrate that great day of San Pedro. Now, the music resounded."
