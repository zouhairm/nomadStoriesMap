Text: "The setting sun cast a golden glow on the right side of the church below me,\
  \ while shadow had already taken the rest. He found me staring at it, and sat to\
  \ my left. My feet throbbed in my boots, soaked in sweat and sticky socks. Almost\
  \ 300,000 pilgrims from all over the planet walk to Santiago de Compostela in North-West\
  \ Spain each year, from various points in Europe. I had begun in France, having\
  \ walked now for six long days. \n\nThe air was fresh and cooling, and the aroma\
  \ of carrot soup cooking was wafting my way from the religious hostel behind us\
  \ in Villamayor de Monjardin. I turned to collect a stronger scent of it into my\
  \ nostrils, noticing a sign that read \u201CChristian meditation. 20:30. All welcome.\u201D\
  \n\n\u201CAre you a believer?\u201D the man offered in an accent I couldn\u2019\
  t place.\n\nI turned only now to look at him. An older man, hair on each side but\
  \ none in between, with glasses through which I found healing eyes, his hands clasped\
  \ together comfortably in front of him. I had no idea how to answer that.\n\n\u201C\
  I want to believe that there is something.\u201D\n\nChurches had always scared me.\
  \ The cold, the darkness, the crucifixion. I always wondered why they didn\u2019\
  t choose to display the resurrection instead. Yet, here I was, on a Christian pilgrimage,\
  \ grieving my Buddhist father.\n\nThe shadow was now spreading, almost entirely\
  \ covering the church spire, moving like rapidly growing ivy, weaving itself into\
  \ the distant hills in the October dusk. \n\n\u201CStart with yourself,\u201D the\
  \ man advised, taking his eyes back to the church, \u201Cand then if you wish, Jesus\
  \ will follow.\u201D\n\nI had yet to figure out how to believe in myself, but perhaps\
  \ a 500 mile walk across a country was a good time to try. I also wasn\u2019t sure\
  \ if I wanted to explore Jesus. He was always the part I found hard to get on board\
  \ with. \n\nThe man enlightened me that he was a volunteer at the hostel, whose\
  \ ethos is to care for the physical and spiritual needs of the pilgrims who stay\
  \ there. It is also, if one should desire it, a place to learn more about Jesus\
  \ Messiah.\n\n\u201CDo you think God\u2014or Jesus,\u201D I attempted, \u201Cminds\
  \ that some of the pilgrims are not believers?\u201D\n\nThe sun was now making its\
  \ final decent in the West, leaving behind a palette of reds and oranges; a fiery\
  \ reminder of its presence.\n\n\u201CYou don\u2019t have to believe in someone for\
  \ them to believe in you.\u201D\n\nHe came and went as fast as the sun had set,\
  \ and left a lasting mark on my mind, just as the sun had.\n\nI never caught his\
  \ name. At 20:30, I went to Christian meditation."
