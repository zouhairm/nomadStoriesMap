Text: "My bus whirred along the highway to Pune, tasseled window coverings bouncing\
  \ in time with potholes in the road. I fumbled with my earphones, hazy and tired,\
  \ ready to tune out the chaotic klaxons of the trucks and the insistent beeping\
  \ of the tuk-tuks outside. I had arrived in India for work a few days prior and\
  \ the jet lag, combined with a gruelling schedule of social events, had left me\
  \ completely drained; there are only so many times you can smile, nod, and comment\
  \ on the excellency of the gulab jamun. \n\nAs I dialled into my favourite playlist,\
  \ a smiling and chubby middle-aged woman approached, her round hips swaying as the\
  \ bus wove in and out of traffic. She plopped down next to me unceremoniously. \n\
  \n\u2018Sunita!\u2019 She declared jovially, hand to her breast. \u2018Pascale,\u2019\
  \ I gestured, meekly smiling back. \n\n\u2018How you?\u2019 \u2018Sleepy,\u2019\
  \ I mimed, hands prayer-clasped under my cheek. \n\n\u2018Me too!\u2019 Sunita giggled,\
  \ showing no such signs of fatigue. I groaned inwardly, as what little hope I had\
  \ of a nap trickled away. Sunita rummaged momentarily in her sparkling pink sari,\
  \ and proudly proffered a small, sepia-toned photograph of a moustachioed man.\n\
  \n\u2018Husband!\u2019 she declared triumphantly, smiling broadly again. I laughed,\
  \ pulled in by her exuberance. \u2018You?\u2019 She said, prompting me eagerly.\L\
  \ \u2018No, no \u2014 boyfriend,\u2019 I said, holding up one finger, asking her\
  \ to wait a moment while I pulled up an image on my iPhone.\n\n\u2018Oh!\u2019 she\
  \ giggled, covering her face with her hands. Sunita chuckled, pointing at his bushy\
  \ beard. Holding up three fingers, she said: \u2018Daughter,\u2019 her pinky popped\
  \ up, \u2018son. You?\u2019\n\n\u2018No, no,\u2019 I said again, but Sunita suddenly\
  \ clasped my hands, iPhone within them, and practically shouted: \u2018Yes! Three!\u2019\
  \ She pointed emphatically at my boyfriend\u2019s likeness. \u2018One day! One day!\u2019\
  \ I laughed again, shrugging my shoulders comically, grinning: \u2018Maybe!\u2019\
  \ \n\nSunita looked suddenly very sad, the corners of her mouth turning down. I\
  \ noticed the long grey streak in the front of her hair, and how the skin around\
  \ her eyes remained crinkled, even though she had stopped smiling. \u2018Go away,\u2019\
  \ she said, holding up her first finger. \n\n\u2018Your daughter?\u2019 I asked.\
  \ Sunita nodded solemnly, \u2018Marry. Me too,\u2019 she pointed at the photograph\
  \ of her husband again, \u2018far away.\u2019 Sunita looked down, bottom lip trembling.\
  \ \n\nI reached over and took her hands, feeling that they were rough but warm.\
  \ Suddenly, she looked up brightly, her grin as broad as ever: \u2018My house, you\
  \ come, always!\u2019 she concluded, squeezing my hand."
