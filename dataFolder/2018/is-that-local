Text: "\u201CDo you speak English?\u201D I was in a small supermarket in Dorgali in\
  \ rural Sardinia, and keen to find some tasty local foods. The young woman behind\
  \ the large delicatessen counter shyly answered \u201CYes, a little.\u201D\nI was\
  \ standing in front of a large delicatessen display cabinet. All sorts of olives,\
  \ soft and hard and sheep and goat cheeses, nougat, various salumi, sausages and\
  \ pancetta, truffles, oils, breads and more. Everything looked delicious. \u201C\
  What\u2019s local\u201D I asked, gesturing broadly at all of these offerings. \n\
  \u201CSorry?\u201D was the response.\n\u201CI want to try some local things. What\
  \ comes from around here?\u201D \nI could tell that my message wasn\u2019t getting\
  \ through. Perhaps my accent was too broad. Maybe I was speaking too fast. The woman\
  \ behind the counter seemed keen to help, but I had confused her. I tried again,\
  \ this time slower, more deliberate\u2026slightly louder \u201CDoes any of this\
  \ food come from this district?\u201D\nAfter a tiny hesitation, the woman dashed\
  \ off towards the front of the store \u201COne moment please.\u201D\nA few minutes\
  \ later, the woman is back with a man. With just the tiniest hint of an accent,\
  \ he says \u201CHello Sir. Can I help you?\u201D \n\u201CHi, I\u2019m from Australia,\
  \ and I\u2019m really interested in trying some local foods.\u201D I gestured towards\
  \ across the large display and said \u201CI want to know what\u2019s local here.\u201D\
  \nThe man had a slightly amused look. There was a lengthy exchange in Italian. Finally,\
  \ the man replied \u201CSorry sir. I understand your question now. You want to know\
  \ if it is possible to buy foods that are from Rome or Europe. Is that correct?\u201D\
  \nThe woman adds \u201CSorry Sir. Everything you see here is from around Dorgali.\u201D\
  \nI started to interrupt, to correct the misunderstanding. \u201CNo\u2026\u201D\
  \ \nThen the penny dropped..."
