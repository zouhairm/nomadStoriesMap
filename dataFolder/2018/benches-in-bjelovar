Text: "When the people of Bjelovar, Croatia, heard that an American had come to live\
  \ there, eyebrows were raised.  When they learned it was because I was writing about\
  \ their town, heads were scratched.\_When I took to the streets with my camera,\
  \ I was stopped and asked why. The citizens just couldn\u2019t comprehend a foreigner\
  \ finding their town interesting. The appeal seemed so obvious to me, and I didn\u2019\
  t understand how they didn\u2019t understand.\_ \_\n\nHaving visited for a few days\
  \ on a previous trip, I had been captivated by the charm. Certainly, the centuries-old\
  \ baroque cathedral that stood overlooking the beautiful city park had spoken to\
  \ me. Quaint and colorful cottages sitting atop green rolling hills surrounding\
  \ the area made my heart smile. Cool outdoor coffee bars lining the Korzo (promenade)\
  \ served me not only a cappuccino but a work of art. Then there was the outdoor\
  \ market, exploding in colors, where I spent my mornings overloading the basket\
  \ on my bicycle with farm fresh food. \n\nBut what I witnessed in that park every\
  \ day is what had the most profound effect on me. Benches were pulled close together\
  \ facing each other in almost every section of the park. This is where elderly men\
  \ gathered to discuss politics and the weather.  Teenage boys sat with elbows on\
  \ their thighs, heads close together as if they were sharing state secrets, or at\
  \ least high school secrets. Girls leaned their heads on the shoulders of their\
  \ boyfriends.\_Old couples held hands waiting for church to start. Co-workers assembled\
  \ in small tight groups eating their lunches. Teenage girls sat arm in arm, plotting\
  \ their futures. Passing friends and neighbors stopped to visit and, regardless\
  \ of the age, would greet each other with a kiss on each cheek. \n\nPark employees\
  \ would routinely return the benches back to their proper places every morning,\
  \ but this was a futile effort. By lunch time, the benches had all been paired up\
  \ again. Each day I would sit in the park gazebo, eating my lunch, and marvel at\
  \ the display of affection.\n\nIn the four months I lived in Croatia, I spent a\
  \ great deal of time exploring this fascinating country. Between adventures, I found\
  \ great joy in returning to my home at the edge of the city park. \n\nThe longer\
  \ I lived in Bjelovar the less the locals questioned me about why I was there. Instead,\
  \ they thanked me for reminding them of what a beautiful life they enjoy in their\
  \ lovely town."
