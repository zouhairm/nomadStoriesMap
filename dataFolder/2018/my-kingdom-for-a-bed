Text: "Legend has it that under the boulders that sit at the top of Snowdon lies the\
  \ body of a giant killed by King Arthur and buried there. I can't see any mythological\
  \ creatures up here but maybe that's just the thick cloud cover swirling around\
  \ the summit preventing me from spotting any abnormally large people looking for\
  \ a fight. It's probably a good thing since I think I'd struggle with any sort of\
  \ scrap after the 3-hour ascent to the peak. Now I just have to deal with the 3\
  \ hours down again, perhaps I can find a centaur to slap on the way. \nNot that\
  \ I ever had the intention of going in search of giants, claiming the throne of\
  \ England or even just climbing the mountain itself but two friends are training\
  \ for a climb up Kilimanjaro and had settled on the idea that Snowdon would be a\
  \ good starting point. I and some others tagged along to make a weekend of it and\
  \ now six of us are up a mountain, sweating due to the abnormally warm weather and\
  \ considering the downward journey.\nWaking was never going to be an issue, I could\
  \ have (and have) walked for days and ever since I was around 16-years-old I've\
  \ been big on it but something I was a little more wary of was camping. As a child,\
  \ every school break, bank holiday, family holiday and just general weekends were\
  \ spent in fields, crammed into a canvas tarp on poles with my family, more often\
  \ than not freezing to death and soaked to the bone. As I grew older, other anxieties\
  \ and preciousness about personal hygiene also played a part. Childhood trauma solidly\
  \ cemented in my psyche, at some point I decided to forego the activity ever again\
  \ unless completely unavoidable but somehow I managed to get so far into the organisation\
  \ of this trip without realising I was to be camping and when I was in too deep\
  \ to pull out, it was sprung on me like a lion on a gazelle leaving me to flail\
  \ about looking for the correct equipment.\nFinding I only had a pop-up tent I use\
  \ for music festivals and absolutely nothing else, I asked around for a more sturdy\
  \ shelter and borrowed a tiny one-man tent from my father that he uses for storage\
  \ rather than sleeping in because it's just too small. I, on the other hand, didn't\
  \ mind its coffin-like proportions, it was a strangely comforting preparation for\
  \ the big sleep itself, as morbid as that may sound. Still, I'd rather have had\
  \ a B&B, readiness for death doesn't quite match up to a decent, hot shower and\
  \ somewhere to charge your phone. Npt that any of that matters, especially when\
  \ up on high."
