Text: "It was the expected trip to the Kingdom of Morocco, for the beauty and charm\
  \ of this country I could not forget the magnificence of what I saw. Natural creativity\
  \ and charm, painted by the Creator and crowned by the hearts of simple, pleasant\
  \ and hospitable people.\nWe stayed in Casablanca, where we enjoyed the charm and\
  \ splendour of that city and its picturesque surroundings. Then we went to Rabat,\
  \ the beautiful and distinctive capital, where we tasted there for the first time\
  \ Moroccan dish of Tagine, and walked on Prince Street and Mohamed V Street. From\
  \ Rabat we head to Marrakesh, a bustling and lively city, Marrakesh, beauty, tourism\
  \ and joy.\nHow can I forget the splendour of the Majorelle Park and the beautiful\
  \ old and beautiful Jama\xE2 El Fna area, and the walk has a special flavor in the\
  \ old Marrakesh neighbourhoods, which are the most ancient of civilisation and heritage.\
  \ You will automatically feel the splendour of this place and its magnificence,\
  \ and before the farewell of Marrakech we visited the saffron park, the land of\
  \ Moroccan saffron production.\nThose wishing to visit Morocco should pass through\
  \ Agadir, the coastal city that is considered the pearl of Morocco and its natural\
  \ paradise, it is the nicest place to sit on Agadir Beach and enjoy a refreshing\
  \ solarium, for those with a romantic sense, visit Olhao Park or the Lovers Garden,\
  \ From the romantic atmosphere we moved to the atmosphere of civilisation and history\
  \ when we entered the castle of Agadir or Agadir Ofla, and before sunset we visited\
  \ the old town of Tiznit and walked in its traditional village markets.\nOur next\
  \ destination was the city of Tangier, where we visited Hercules Cave and enjoyed\
  \ that rare natural masterpiece. At sunrise we went to the \"Edge Cafe\" next door\
  \ to our hotel and there we enjoyed seeing the sun slowly disappearing from behind\
  \ the sea and the delicious Moroccan tea flavor was memorable. Every person who\
  \ loves heritage, history and architectural beauty should visit Meknes, the city\
  \ that is the heart of the religious civilisation in Morocco, we entered the tomb\
  \ of Moulay Ismail, whose architectural form is an aesthetic masterpiece. We then\
  \ visited the Dar al-Jami'i Museum, where we learned about Moroccan civilisation\
  \ through traditional home furnishings, traditional antiques and Andalusian design.\n\
  Morocco is the land of beauty and magic and its people the people of goodness and\
  \ pride, and those who love beauty and magic should love this country."
