Text: "It was july 2010, After to have flyed 14 hours approximately, since Caracas\
  \ to Cairo. I was very tired but I very happy too, it was my first travel out to\
  \ my Country Venezuela. My dream since child. Only pass for the airport me connected\
  \ to Egypt. The air smelled different as a mix the cinnamon with spices. The guide\
  \ carry us direct the station\xB4s train. It was amazing, when we  taken the bus,\
  \ the first that I saw is amazing, The Nile river crossed the city. It was a mirage\
  \ , I thought in thats moment. One hour after we arrived to the train\xB4station.\
  \ I was very surprised, it as a old picture, many native people looked at us. Maybe\
  \ they were not used to seeing many Latinas together or only it was my confused\
  \ mind. We took the train and each group was taken to his car, to through the windows\
  \ you could see the landscape that we recovered from the station to Aswan. The Goats\
  \ with their shepherds roamed the lands, the great Sahara stood proud, showing himself\
  \ majestic as a pharaoh with his treasures. It was more than 4 hours by train, which\
  \ arrived in Aswuan, where we took the bus that takes us directly to the cruise.\
  \ It was like seeing a great palace on the waters of the Nile. We went in and they\
  \ offered us a welcome tea and each group assigned us the rooms, another magical\
  \ surprise was to see our cabin, it was simple but comfortable and everyone took\
  \ turns using the bathroom and that we had two days of travel and it was what the\
  \ body asked of us. While I waited my turn, I tried to cover the window curtains\
  \ to see the landscape. I could not believe it, we were already sailing on the Nile,\
  \ and the last thing I expected to see was the closeness I could have to that great\
  \ river. Rio that was navigated by the ancient pharaohs and that I a simple mortal\
  \ had the privilege of sailing. The next day we went to visit the temple of Philae,\
  \ which still dazzles as in its early days, the inclement sun touched our bodies,\
  \ since in July the temperatures rise more by the temprada. The temple is located\
  \ on an island in the Nile River, just to imagine the old scenes that could have\
  \ been presented in antiquity I was thrilled and with that the heat I had was gone.We\
  \ went to the Red Sea, and we could learn that its name was for fish and not because\
  \ of the color of its waters. The days in Egypt became endless, we lost the notion\
  \ of time, that's why I enjoyed the trip because I did not think about tomorrow,\
  \ only now.I know that one day I will return, because my heart was in Egypt."
