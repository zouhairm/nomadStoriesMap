Text: "What could a young, dumb, and barely able to make ends meet high schooler possibly\
  \ see in an opportunity to travel abroad and visit an awe inspiring first world\
  \ country, like the United Kingdom? A job, merely - a quick and easy fix to every\
  \ young adult's problem. But can you really condemn us craving for financial independence?\
  \ For inheriting a 'utopian' society from our forefathers, where just the basic\
  \ necessities of survival can cost you an arm and a leg? No, you can't, but it's\
  \ nothing to be proud of all the same. Individuals with this kind of judgement have\
  \ no time or patience for the mind or spirit, and primarily focus on hedonistic\
  \ satisfaction, ignoring life's true pleasures and colors. I, as shameful as it\
  \ might be to say, was still part of this group of lifeless people when I was traveling\
  \ by bus through Europe's megacities to the small town by the name of Bridgwater,\
  \ located in the western part of England. Now, being dropped by the bus in the middle\
  \ of nowhere without a single acquaintance in a thousand mile radius with nothing\
  \ but your duffel bag, minor directions around town, some plans to meet your new\
  \ landlords and, shady at best details about the job you 'got', would probably force\
  \ a sane person to stop himself for a minute and rethink all his life choices leading\
  \ up to this moment, but it stopped me, too. However, I had little intentions of\
  \ remembering all the past mistakes that lead me here, so I lurched onward towards\
  \ the promised meeting point. And then, from the moment I shook my landlords hand;\
  \ from my very first ''Hello'' to my last ''goodbye''; from my first footprint on\
  \ the Queen's land to the last \u2013 my days were wholesome. People here didn't\
  \ care about making money \u2013 they cared about each other. They didn't take every\
  \ chance they had to ruin someone's day for little to none gain \u2013 they focused\
  \ on helping each other. They didn't care about my ancestry or my believes \u2013\
  \ they took me in with open arms, invited me to bars, BBQ's, social gatherings.\
  \ Them, sharing their stories, culture \u2013 all of it, the connection i felt between\
  \ the locals, it made me feel at home. It helped me see the world as something more\
  \ than a depressing God and Satan's game of chess. It made me see that life is full\
  \ of... well life. You can probably guess how beaten down I was when the time came\
  \ for me to come home, how sad I was that this chapter of my life is about to come\
  \ to a close. But it made me see, that there are plenty of chapters still unwritten."
