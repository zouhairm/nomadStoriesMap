Text: "Men huddled by, obsessed on ticking Christmas gifts of their long lists. In\
  \ the background droning voices, chaotic traffic and kitschy Christmas Songs dominated\
  \ those vibrant streets in the city centre of Spain\u2019s Capital, Madrid. He was\
  \ lying on the cold floor, only a thin blanket warming his trembling body while\
  \ begging for support. With every word he said, his warm breath mixed with freezing\
  \ air.\n\nWitnessing the scenario, made me think. It was not the first time I saw\
  \ homeless people unnoticed by the crowd and excluded from society. This year I\
  \ wanted to make a difference, with a purpose and a solid plan, The evening I started\
  \ the mission packing the presents, including Tangerines, apples, nuts, chocolate\
  \ and cereal bars, Jaime, a friend spontaneously wanted to hang out. As he found\
  \ out about the mission, immediately he wanted to be part of it. We felt like kids\
  \ sitting on the floor, cutting stars out of yellow paper and crafting those pieces\
  \ of charity while listening to Hip Hop music. The combination might be rare, but\
  \ a memory that situates a smile on my face. \n\nTogether we created 20 bags filled\
  \ with winter snacks. We started on Gran Via to spread them, a well-known shopping\
  \ street with magnificent theatres. I headed to a needy man with a plastic cup in\
  \ front of him. A surprised smile on his face revealed his joy when I handed him\
  \ the gift. Then we crossed a Christmas market. The smell of churros, a typical\
  \ Spanish dessert, filled the air with cinnamon and chocolate. There, we saw a man\
  \ and we offered him what we had. With anger in his face, he was shouting at me,\
  \ that he needs no alms. It was the moment I realized, reactions are different and\
  \ people are not used to missions like this. \nMinutes later, we met a thin woman,\
  \ no hair and rotten teeth. With shivering hands and pure gratitude, she accepted\
  \ the gift, while watching me with sparkling eyes.\n\nConnecting to people has a\
  \ lot of meaning and potential to beautify days, especially in big cities like Madrid.\
  \ I will never forget about the stories those individuals shared with me, and that\
  \ every meeting can be a present. It feels wonderful to give, independent of getting\
  \ anything back. \nIt was a captivating experience. For the next mission, I learned\
  \ that not everybody owns the luxury of proper teeth, able to eat for example apples.\
  \ I will think about an alternative, but I am glad we warmed hearts on frosty winter\
  \ days."
