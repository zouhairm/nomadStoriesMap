Text: "\u201CLadies and gentlemen, if you look through the windows on the right you\
  \ will be able to see the Aconcagua mountain\u201D. People talk but I can only count\
  \ until six. Amidst the anxiety flying gives me I open my eyes. I close them again\
  \ so I can picture the grass on my feet instead of the height in my guts. Inhale:\
  \ one, two, three. Exhale: four, five, six. Inhale: one, two, three. Exhale: four,\
  \ five, s\u2026That image cannot be real; I simply must have seen something else.\
  \ \nI barely open my right eye to look at the window. But there it is. Pink-kissed\
  \ by the velvet sunset. Displaying its permanent white gown for us. Rooting a whole\
  \ continent and leaving this traveler completely astounded. I start to wonder where\
  \ I found the luck to have arrived at this point. All that my parents had to give\
  \ up so I could dream. \u201CHow cold is at its peak?\u201D When love decided mine\
  \ has to be from one world away. \u201CWhat color is the last flower that grew in\
  \ its skirt?\u201D. The day I headed to the South to end up finding my true North.\
  \ \u201CAm I really higher than this column holding the sky?\u201D Everything that\
  \ has come along forever changing my skin and bones. For every cultural difference\
  \ amended with a laugh and each friend that I promise to see once again. All the\
  \ sunsets that have taken my breath away. The landscapes I captured in my mind so\
  \ I can visit them over and over again. \nThe Aconcagua is waving goodbye while\
  \ getting lost in the horizon. I am no longer counting until six. Fear is gone,\
  \ I am ready to live what is to come next."
