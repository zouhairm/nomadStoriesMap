Text: "West of Drumheller, Alberta is a region of badlands surrounded by prairies\
  \ known as the \u2018Horseshoe Canyon\u2019, the kind of wide open diverse terrain\
  \ in which a dinosaur may choose to chase you. Drumheller is known for its Cretaceous\
  \ era discoveries and most notably the Albertosaurus, a close relative to the T-Rex.\
  \ We arrived in our 1990\u2019s mustang a mere 20 years ago and not 100 million\
  \ and 20 years ago as prey. As kids tend to do, we immediately decided to explore,\
  \  rushing out into the canyon. These little side trips end up being the most notable\
  \ part of visiting any destination.\nThe sun glistens at our back, it\u2019s mid-afternoon,\
  \ and the mouth of the canyon invites us in; our mom decided to stay back and read,\
  \ this is before the prevalence of cell phones and quick help. My brother climbs\
  \ some higher and higher hills leading us right towards the centre. He continues\
  \ to drag us further in search of a cool oasis within the emptiness. From atop a\
  \ mound we can no longer see where we\u2019ve entered, but see the other side in\
  \ what looks like an attainable distance. Haha- not. The sound of a coyote hollers\
  \ in the distance. This side trip just got serious. The sun has shifted and a cold\
  \ air starts to blow in from the east. Only a few hours until nightfall and no way\
  \ of getting back. We convene again, deciding to scale an impossible looking mountain\
  \ peak and find a side way out of the canyon or risk having to fend off wile visitors\
  \ overnight. It was tough to be upset with the beauty of the canyon all around us\
  \ along with the sunset displayed low in the sky with all orange hues overlooking\
  \ the grass, dirt, rocks, crests and valleys, each in its perfectly painted spot.\
  \ I may have mentally blocked out a bit of the memory out of fear but the next I\
  \ remember is scaling the side of a mound, nearly losing my shoe and looking down\
  \ to what would have been a 100-foot fall while climbing sideways. I then gained\
  \ composure, looking to my destination and making the decision that I was going\
  \ to get to the other side wit my body going numb and blanking out again until we\
  \ emerged from the canyon unscathed. \nSometimes it\u2019s the decisions you don\u2019\
  t make that bring you to places unknown. The tiny decisions that bring you further\
  \ and further out until you\u2019ve done something catastrophically amazing. This\
  \ is the story of a decision to adventure that led me to an edge and left a mark\
  \ on my heart of beauty, fear and everything in between. Isn\u2019t that what travel\
  \ is all about? Ask the Dinosaurs."
