Text: "It is 9 o\u2019clock in the morning and after a 17-hour flight we are finally\
  \ stepping through the main entrance of the Jos\xE9 Mart\xED International Airport\
  \ in Havana, Cuba. The temperature must be nearly 30\xB0 C. \n\nAt the door we are\
  \ greeted by attractive women in army uniforms. \n\u201CI wouldn\u2019t mind getting\
  \ arrested over here,\u201D jokes my uncle. Needless to say that this mood lasts\
  \ us only until we notice a group of soldiers leaning on their firearms nearby.\
  \ \n\nHowever, a real problem occurred - it seems impossible for a foreigner to\
  \ get to the centre without paying 30 Euros for a taxi. This represents quite an\
  \ issue since our budget is limited. Fortunately, by chance we bump into a charismatic\
  \ young man who will later introduce himself as Nestor Sanchez. \n \nNestor is a\
  \ 29 years old Colombian student who currently lives in the South of Havana. \n\
  He came to Cuba 4 years ago to improve himself as a physiotherapist in a local medical\
  \ school. \u201CCuban medicine is renowned for its quality and affordability.\u201D\
  \ explains Nestor. \u201CCome on, I\u2019ll show you which \u201Cguagua\u201D (bus)\
  \ to take.\u201D \n\nNestor has become our guide in Havana and it is irrefutable\
  \ that he has honored this post with flying colors. He has shown us a lot about\
  \ everyday life in Havana, explaining to us what he has experienced in the last\
  \ 4 years, talking about Cuban history and the political system. \n\u201CLife in\
  \ here is so colorful, yet so different from what you know. Internet is available\
  \ only to a handful of chosen ones and travelling is allowed only to those whose\
  \ families live abroad.\u201D At first we find it difficult to believe Nestor\u2019\
  s words. \u201CCome on, I\u2019ll show you the \u201Cmalec\xF3n\u201D (embankment)\
  \ and you can ask some citizens.\u201D\n \nWe are sitting on the low wall which\
  \ borders the malec\xF3n, sipping a can of local beer called \u201CBucanero\u201D\
  . Although it\u2019s getting late, you can still hear the laughter of people, roaring\
  \ engines of historical cars and the ubiquitous reggaeton played from innumerable\
  \ portable radios. After a while we are surrounded by a group of young Cubans. \n\
  \n\u201CWith regard to politics, talking with tourists is our only reliable source\
  \ of information. But we are not allowed to. The police are coming! You have to\
  \ say we are long-time friends on Facebook, otherwise we will be severely fined,\u201D\
  \ whispers one of the young men. \nHis statement leaves us speechless. \n\nThis\
  \ experience has exposed the hell within the tropical paradise that we could hardly\
  \ have imagined from the sight of glossy flyers shown by travel agencies."
