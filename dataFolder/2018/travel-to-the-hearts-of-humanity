Text: "When travel, I like to mingle with the locals and study their reactions. The\
  \ world is a small place and we are all the same , irrespective of our race, religion\
  \ or skin color. We crave for the same level of happiness and kids are the best\
  \ source of pure innocence and joy. \nOn one such trip to United Arab Emirates,\
  \  I was approached by a little boy who wanted to sell me some beads. Since I was\
  \ already over packed with lots of shopping, I declined his offer and told him I\
  \ did not need any but he pointed to his mom who seemed to be unwell. \nI got down\
  \ from my Hop on- Hop off bus and walked with him towards a humble dwelling where\
  \ his mom lived. Thoughts like it could be a trap or the boy could be be a victim\
  \ of child trafficking crossed my mind, but I kept walking with him and relied on\
  \ my intuition. \nOnce we reached his home, I met his mother and spoke to her about\
  \ her family and the importance of education for her son. She told me that despite\
  \ her poor economic condition and her ill health, her son attended school and helped\
  \ her sell beads after school. She also showed me his school documents and her medical\
  \ file. She took me to a nearby local NGO that was helping her establish a local\
  \ business from home, so she did not have to travel to the market to sell the beads\
  \ that she made herself.  I then bought some beads from her and she was very grateful.\
  \ I also decided to help her monetarily with whatever little amount that I had but\
  \ she declined the offer as her religious beliefs prohibited her from accepting\
  \ money that was not hard earned. Respecting her sentiments, I asked her if I could\
  \ click a pic of her son to capture his pure joy and she replied in affirmation.The\
  \ instant reaction of the lad on being clicked was to cover his face with his hands.I\
  \ asked him if he was aware of my country India, to which he said he has watched\
  \ Bollywood stars in movies. His innocent reply made me laugh and I promised to\
  \ send him some movie posters but also made him promise that he would stay loyal\
  \ to his studies. This interaction with the locals of a new country made my day.\
  \ I showed him his pic and he blushed and ran back to his mother. Nothing defines\
  \ joy of life better than such once in a lifetime experiences."
