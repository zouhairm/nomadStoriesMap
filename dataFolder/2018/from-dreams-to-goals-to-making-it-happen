Text: "My travel story might not seem like much on the outside, but it is passionately\
  \ driving me on the inside. The year 2018 is the year I\u2019ve decided to stop\
  \ letting fear rule me, and to make the changes I\u2019ve always been too scared\
  \ to make.\nBeing half Korean, I am incredibly interested in other cultures. When\
  \ I was thirteen years old, I said I wanted to open an orphanage in Russia. This\
  \ got a few looks. I was told I should choose a more convenient path in life.\n\
  As the years went on, I did the ordinary things many teenagers and young adults\
  \ do. But it was always exhausting and it left me wanting more. The more I thought\
  \ about this, the more I realized that I am only fooling myself by thinking I \u201C\
  should\u201D be content with this version of stability because that\u2019s what\
  \ modern society tells me is normal. I wondered, why can't I get a job that I truly\
  \ enjoy? Why can't I love waking up in the morning and going to work? Why do I have\
  \ to wait until I retire to truly live and love my life?\nSo, I decided to do two\
  \ things that I had been to scared to do before 2018.\nFirst, I found my mother.\n\
  After two months of searching, I found her. It had been 25 years, but it was incredible\
  \ and everything I had always dreamed. I have been able to ask her what it was like\
  \ growing up in Korea, and about what she's done in the United States for the past\
  \ 30 years. When I visited her, we talked in the kitchen while she made authentic\
  \ Korean food. We have been texting and talking every day since.\nSecond was to\
  \ push myself into a career I love.\nI was stable at my old job, and supposedly\
  \ ready to cross another life milestone: buy a house. The problem was deciding where.\
  \ It seems logical to buy a house in Colorado, where I am currently based. However,\
  \ the rest of my family is in Michigan, and I've been pensive over the idea of moving\
  \ to Washington or Oregon. These are beautiful states, and all of them have strong\
  \ attractions for living there.\nAs I struggled with the decision, I realized I\
  \ wanted to be able to live in these places! And I didn't want to wait until I'm\
  \ retired.\nTherefore, my goal is to travel around the world, meeting new people,\
  \ learning about their cultures, telling their stories, as well as my own. Going\
  \ to Argentina would be the beginning of what I hope to accomplish in life."
