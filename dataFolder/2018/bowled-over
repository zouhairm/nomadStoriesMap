Text: "The husband was very keen on Las Vegas. Gambling doesn\u2019t get me excited\
  \ but for Ramesh it\u2019s beyond excitement and I didn\u2019t have the heart to\
  \ throw culture and art at him and see his eyes go blank. \nThe lyrics \u2018like\
  \ a circle in a spiral, a wheel within a wheel, never ending or beginning\u2019\
  \ best describes the way Las Vegas functions - seamlessly. One of the many Cirque\
  \ Du Soleil shows on offer would be a good example. We settled for Mystere at Treasure\
  \ Island. The stage is dynamic. Rising up in different levels through smoke or filling\
  \ with water to create a pool and artists with exaggerated hairstyles and costumes\
  \ which look like they have been painted on, achieve impossible feats on the trapeze\
  \ suspended high above the stage. You watch with your heart in your mouth because\
  \ there are no safety nets in sight. The dramatic descent of the Taiko drummers\
  \ with some humungous drums from the darkness up on high and the tempo of the drumming\
  \ had me enthralled. The clever lighting added to the mystery.\nFor those who designed\
  \ the casinos and entertainment you got to dream wild and actually had a budget\
  \ to realize your concepts and design.\nWe went to Rumjungle in the Mandalay Bay\
  \ Resort which boasted of having all the rums from around the world, I had to see\
  \ if they had Old Monk rum from India. They didn\u2019t but the bar was a hundred\
  \ and forty four feet long and nineteen feet high stacked with a plethora of bottles\
  \ of rum.\nThe musical fountains of the Bellagio. Wonder what the design brief for\
  \ this one was. Jets of water which look like lengths of satin ribbon twirl, swirl\
  \ and bend in sinuous unison like visual lyrics for the piece of instrumental music\
  \ and lights which are all synchronized. We waited to witness this truly mesmerizing\
  \ sight like a number of others because at the time there was nothing comparable\
  \ anywhere in the world. My favourite was the Fiori di Como in the lobby of the\
  \ Bellagio. I am a huge fan of Dale Chihuly\u2019s work and here were 2,000 hand\
  \ blown unique glass flowers positioned on the 2,100 square feet ceiling and you\
  \ can\u2019t help but stare. \nThe seduction is so subtle you end up loosening your\
  \ purse strings. The Wheel of Fortune and the slot machines got a lot of my money\
  \ but I was happy at the end of the weekend because I came back with a container\
  \ full of quarters to feed the washing machine and dryer. I wasn\u2019t expecting\
  \ to come back a gambler and nor did I expect to be rooting for Las Vegas as a destination\
  \ to indulge in an art and design treasure hunt."
