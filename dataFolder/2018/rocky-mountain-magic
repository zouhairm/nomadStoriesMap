Text: "I pull up to the tiny shack and lower my window. The ranger recognizes me.\
  \ At check-in, I\u2019d confided that it was my first time camping\u2014and that\
  \ I was doing it alone.\n\u201CHow did it go?\u201D she grins.\n\u201CIt was great!\u201D\
  \ I exult. \u201CI put the tent up by myself and everything!\u201D We laugh. Beaming,\
  \ she turns to the other ranger. \u201CShe survived her first night camping\u2014\
  all by herself!\u201D\nI drive away, pleased by her praise. Solo female travelers\
  \ are rare, and I\u2019m usually viewed with a mix of pity and concern. People I\
  \ meet on my journeys ask, \u201CDoesn\u2019t it bother you to travel alone?\u201D\
  \nHappily single for years now, I share my secret with the skeptics: visiting Glacier\
  \ National Park while unattached means I\u2019m free to fall in love with the park\
  \ itself. I don\u2019t mind trading the scent of a man\u2019s cologne for the heady\
  \ aroma of cedar, or listening to a rushing stream rather than a lover\u2019s whisper.\n\
  Under azure August skies, I spend hours driving the glorious Going-To-The-Sun Road,\
  \ where vistas of rugged mountains and magenta carpets of fireweed leave me as breathless\
  \ as a first kiss. After a day in Glacier\u2019s company, I\u2019m completely smitten.\n\
  In the late afternoon, I arrive at Logan Pass. I\u2019m hours early for tonight\u2019\
  s Star Party, but I want to hike a bit of the Highline Trail before sunset. At this\
  \ time of day, the crowds have abated, and I find myself blissfully alone. The sun\
  \ sinks toward the glacier-carved peaks, painting the valley in shades of violet.\n\
  When I first see him, he\u2019s crouched on the path, adjusting his tripod. In normal\
  \ life I keep to myself, but travel has a way of dissolving my usual shyness. I\
  \ stop to chat. His name is Michael, and he\u2019s a professional landscape photographer.\
  \ As he stands to face me, I think, \u201CHey, he\u2019s cute!\u201D We discuss\
  \ the parks we\u2019ve visited (Yosemite is his favorite) and I don\u2019t want\
  \ to leave, but the Star Party beckons. Never one to make the first move, I\u2019\
  m surprised when I hear myself ask for his number. Contact information exchanged,\
  \ I bid him good night. As I stride away, I shock myself by calling over my shoulder,\
  \ \u201Cmaybe we can go to Yosemite together sometime.\u201D \nThat night I write\
  \ in my journal, blushing like a schoolgirl as I recall my brazenness in inviting\
  \ a man I\u2019d just met to travel with me. Was I simply overcome by the romance\
  \ of meeting a handsome stranger on a mountaintop at sunset? I shake my head and\
  \ scribble, \u201CI wonder if I\u2019ll hear from him.\u201D\nThe next morning,\
  \ I wake to a text: \u201CHow was the Star Party?\u201D It\u2019s him.\n\u201CStellar,\u201D\
  \ I reply."
