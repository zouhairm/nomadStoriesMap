Text: "Flight Bologna \u2013 Athens, 19th July 2017. \nI had graduated just two weeks\
  \ before, and I would have spend the next two weeks around Greece, to celebrate\
  \ this great goal: first some days in Athens, and then the rest in Santorini.\n\
  And right in Athens I met Amalia, nay, on the flight: I was going, she was coming\
  \ back. She was coming back home after some weeks she had spent in Italy with friends\
  \ known during her Erasmus experience some years before.\nShe is a slim brunette\
  \ with a colorful kimono, and she was sitting right next to me.\nShe saw I was reading\
  \ the Athens guide, looking for some information about the city. She simply asked\
  \ me \u201CFirst time in Athens?\u201D, and I answered \u201CYes, first time!\u201D\
  .\nDuring the two hours of the flight we talked no stop: she told me about the information\
  \ I was looking for on the guide, and she wrote on my moleskine a list of bars,\
  \ restaurants and all the monuments, museums and sightseeing I should visit in Athens.\
  \ \nAnd the more we talked, the more it seemed I've already known her. We laughed,\
  \ joked and told about funny episodes of our lives, and suddenly we were in Athens.\
  \ Time has flown!\nA particular connection has been created between us in those\
  \ two hours because it didn't matter we hadn't known each other before, it was extremely\
  \ easy talking to her, and it was very natural listening to her life and telling\
  \ her about mine. \nAs soon as we landed at Athens Airport, I gave her my Facebook\
  \ contact and she gave me hers, and then we greeted each other.\n\nAthens, 3 days\
  \ later.\nIt was 7 pm, my friends and I had just come home after a very hot day\
  \ spent around Athens, between the Parthenon and Plaka, the most lively district\
  \ \u2013 Amalia had told me to visit it in the late afternoon, when the bars and\
  \ restaurants owners prepare for dinner, laying the tables right on sidewalks with\
  \ the classic checkered tablecloths, and wooden and straw chairs.\nI was just out\
  \ of the shower when I got a message: \"Hi Giulia, how is your holiday here in town\
  \ going? Hope you're having fun! Tonight I'm going to The Zillers, in Plaka, with\
  \ some friends of mine to eat something.. the view over the city from up there is\
  \ stunning, you should come and see! If you want to join us, my friends and I would\
  \ love it! Let me know, kisses.\"\nIt was one of the most memorable nights of my\
  \ life: she introduced us to her friends and we spent the night laughing and joking,\
  \ and it didn't really take we had met 5 minutes before, we were just a party of\
  \ guys who had terribly fun!"
