Text: "I set off with five friends to the Sariska Tiger Reserve in Rajasthan to get\
  \ over the urban ennui. After driving 106 kms away from Delhi, the concrete jungle\
  \ gave way to charming yellow mustard fields amidst the rocky Aravalis.\nI visited\
  \ the tiger reserve 10 years ago, before poachers stripped the place clean of the\
  \ majestic animals. There were 30 of them at that time. Such was my obsession to\
  \ see the tiger that I made four trips, but the tiger emerged triumphant. Other\
  \ forest beings did not interest me as I found wild boars boring; Sambar deers,\
  \ plain vanilla and the vegetation, uninviting.\nWizened, I returned to the dry\
  \ deciduous forest to enjoy the bliss of wilderness. Anyway, the chances of spotting\
  \ a tiger were slim for the 880 sq km reserve now had only four tigers, all brought\
  \ in from other parks. My friends, however, were keen for a date with the Stripped\
  \ One. \nWe joined the crowd waiting with bated breath. We heard some grunting and\
  \ growling from above the slope. Apparently there were two of them \u2014 a male\
  \ and a female. I suddenly felt guilty...was I intruding? But before you could say\
  \ \u201Cintruder\u201D, I caught a fleeting glimpse of the tigers darting past!\
  \ \nWe returned the next day for another heady \u2018wild fix\u2019. The driver\
  \ took us deeper into the forest; Except for the birdsong and falling of leaves,\
  \ everything was still. It was exhilarating to be so close to nature, to creation,\
  \ to some unseen power. \nVisitors followed the trackers, who said there was a tiger\
  \ somewhere below in the valley. But I convinced my friends to move on and enjoy\
  \ the greens instead. Ten minutes later, someone tugged at my elbow. There he was,\
  \ the Lord of Sariska, striding across the road, just 15 feet away! He knew we were\
  \ there, for he turned his head, gave us an indifferent glance (was he turning up\
  \ his nose?) and walked on and vanished into the tall grass. With no one around,\
  \ the five of us had him to ourselves for full five minutes. I stood speechless.\
  \ \nIt dawned on me that Mother Nature loves those who love her in totality, not\
  \ any part of her. When you do just that, she showers her benevolence on you; this\
  \ time it was in the form of a \u2018sighting\u2019. Though we'd been planning for\
  \ just this kind of experience, to actually see a tiger up close in the open jungle\
  \ was magical, unexpected. It was like seeing God. Aren't nature and its many manifestations\
  \ \u2014 including birds, trees and animals \u2014 expressions of the Divine and,\
  \ therefore, hallowed?"
