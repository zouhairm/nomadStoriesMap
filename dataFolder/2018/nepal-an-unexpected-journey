Text: "In 2017 I found myself working hard in London, feeling the pressure of city\
  \ life and questioning my reasoning for living in this exciting, but expensive city.\
  \ \n\nI had a friend going to Nepal to build an Earthship, a self sufficient structure\
  \ from recycled materials, which would be a school for young women. He'd been begging\
  \ me to go, as I'd frequently talked about my time spent in Asia six years previously.\
  \ I felt time and money were against me, however, a last minute conversation saw\
  \ me six days before the build, throwing caution to the wind and booking a flight.\n\
  \nStepping off the plane into the nighttime bustle of Nepal, I was struck by the\
  \ aching familiarity of forgotten smells and sounds, the hubbub of taxis and shouting\
  \ awoke a half forgotten memory. Walking the streets I remembered the smell of incense\
  \ and I felt the pressures of city life from home, melt away.\n\nThe next day I\
  \ jumped aboard a tiny twelve seater plane, taking me over the mighty Himalayas\
  \ to the mountainous east of Nepal. Stepping off the plane the air was fresh and\
  \ clear, the sky a clear blue dome. I breathed deeply, before heading to camp, still\
  \ wondering what I would find.\n\nOn site I was immediately put to work 'pounding\
  \ tires'. This involves hammering dirt into tires, hard labour that ultimately resulted\
  \ in a 300 pound recyled brick. That first day, I wondered if I would make it. Suddenly\
  \ the reality of living and working with 45 people for a month became very real.\n\
  \nWaking up each morning, I watched the sunrise over the Himalayas from my tent.\
  \ The local community would arrive, wives would be in saris hammering, laughing\
  \ enthusiastic children would fight to carry buckets of soil. Day by day it was\
  \ astonishing to see the amount of change, how fast the structure grew, and the\
  \ links we built with one another. I met an incredible array of people, with whom\
  \ I trekked to the river on days off. I rented a motorbike and saw the sunrise over\
  \ Makalu, sharing a beer with local Nepalese women, delighted with our mimed conversations.\n\
  \nThe last night, people from all the surrounding villages arrived for a celebration\
  \ party. I was covered in red dust and flowers, surrounded by smiles and well wishes\
  \ for a hard job well done. We left behind a structure for women to learn. But I\
  \ learnt so much more than I could have hoped for. Nepal, and building for others,\
  \ reminded me of the beauty of travel, people and spontaneous decisions. All the\
  \ reasons to get out of your comfort zone and just go for it."
