Text: "I'm still looking for the long-awaited \"cultural shock\" that is hard to come.\n\
  In short, Tokyo is a very westernized city and for those like me grew up in Italy\
  \ in the '80s, Japan not a complete new discovery.\nEven if this Japanese people\
  \ don't know it.\nI had to explain to a small manga shop and retro games' owner\
  \ near Kichijoji station. When he heard me asking for \"Mazinga\", he jumped with\
  \ joy, he pulled out a small reproduction of the \"Great Mazinga\" and he asked\
  \ me how I knew him.\nThe same amazement that struck me, on the contrary, when I\
  \ discovered that here they celebrate Christmas. There are trees and lights everywhere,\
  \ and Michael Bubl\xE9 competes with Mariah Carey and Diana Krall in the shops 's\
  \ loudspeakers. \nFortunately today I stretched out to Nakano to do a Sushi preparation\
  \ course. Yoshiaki, my teacher, took three good hours and with infinite patience\
  \ explained everything from the beginning to the end, where for \"the beginning\"\
  \ we mean the history between Japanese people and their sea or \"how to eat the\
  \ sushi\". Because I discovered that we make a lot of mistakes and the taste, if\
  \ eaten in the right way, is completely different. I swear.\nYesterday's visit to\
  \ Electric Town really took me back 30 years. It's a part of Japan stuck in the\
  \ 80s, the moment in history were Japan was teaching to world how to make technology.\
  \ I found myself among an infinity of valves, diodes, antennas, condensers, but\
  \ also girls who love cosplay and endless lanes full of comics and amusement arcades\
  \ games. I think I can call it the paradise of every Arduino lover or any good self-respecting\
  \ nerd so, clearly, I was in ecstasy.\nThis afternoon's walk ended in Ueno, but\
  \ not in the park or among the museums. I purposely lost to Kappabashi, among the\
  \ dozens of kitchen utensils of all kinds, and then among the thousand alleys of\
  \ the perennial market near the station of Ueno. A bright tangle of smells, temples,\
  \ shops of all kinds and sellers of anything in the world can be ingested by a human\
  \ being to feed themselves.\nI certainly cannot say that I still made an impression\
  \ of what I'm experiencing, but I'm sure that the fixedness of the screens must\
  \ increasingly oppose a genuine desire to meet the other. A goal that we can achieve\
  \ only through loss. The removal from our certainties.\nIt's the only way to grow,\
  \ and we can do it starting with how we live our cities, how we relate to the people\
  \ around us.\nAfter all, if we look at it well, the world is closer to us than we\
  \ imagine."
