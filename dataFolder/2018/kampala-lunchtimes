Text: "My first morning in Kampala and I was suddenly heartbroken. I sat and read\
  \ the email again, then a few more times after that. I can\u2019t remember how long\
  \ it took me to say the words out loud. The rising sun dripped through the office\
  \ windows, our small fan bobbing laboriously from side to side trying in vain to\
  \ quell the creeping degrees. \u201CMy Grandad died last night.\u201D Max, sitting\
  \ across from me, stopped typing. Registering the glassy sheen of my eyes he leaned\
  \ back in his chair, exhaling a heavy sigh of sympathy. Then we sat in silence,\
  \ the hum of the fan soothingly consistent. Welcome to Uganda I thought, my home\
  \ for the next three months.\n\nI\u2019ve always loved the trees in Africa, their\
  \ graceful stature seemingly handcrafted perfectly for shelter and on that morning,\
  \ under the shade of the trees outside the office, my trembling emotions began to\
  \ ease to a place of comfort. On the phone my Mum and I cried together, she in Dublin,\
  \ I in this new, unfamiliar place. Sentiments of love and sorrow exchanged, I hung\
  \ up and I couldn\u2019t have felt more adrift than if I\u2019d been in space. Travel\
  \ had suddenly taken me too far.\n\nFunerals happen quickly in Ireland, a Catholic\
  \ tradition that made the decision for me with certainty: it would be difficult\
  \ to return in time. Oddly there came clarity amidst this upset \u2013  this was\
  \ simply how it was, out of my control. Life at its harshest. The subsequent week\
  \ was a fog of supportive calls from colleagues back at our charity in England,\
  \ emails and texts to my sisters and parents and feeble attempts to distract myself\
  \ with work. And lunchtimes. \n\nLunchtimes in Kampala were my therapy. Every day\
  \ at one, our little group sat together, shaded in the garden and we ate, talked\
  \ and solved the problems of the world for over an hour. The spirit of my new Ugandan\
  \ colleagues and friends buoyed me and carried me, when all I wanted was to burst\
  \ into tears. Lunches there were savoured, mulled over, unrushed and without haste\
  \ \u2013 the finer things in life were shared in that little garden, sheltered from\
  \ the glaring African sun. \n\nOn that first night in Kampala, writing a note to\
  \ be read at the funeral, I watched the sun set over the city of seven hills. I\
  \ knew then that I was exactly where I should have been. He would have wanted it\
  \ that way, he would have been proud \u2013 and he would have loved Kampala. Especially\
  \ at lunchtime, in that garden which we sat in every day, where I cried and where\
  \ I remembered, eventually, that I love travel."
