Text: "The train to Glasgow was quiet and crowded enough that we couldn't sit together.\
  \ Arriving in Edinburgh the night before had left me tired, which amplified the\
  \ cold and battleship gray monotony of an overcast day. I was homesick, not camp\
  \ homesick, but space station astronaut homesick, wishing to go home just one day,\
  \ and then come back to my adventure. I was a year into a two-year work assignment\
  \ in London.   \n Three of us were headed to a soccer match, but first, we hit a\
  \ train station pub.  Over beers, Justin our \u201Cexpert\u201D on all things Scotland,\
  \ despite being from Illinois, warned us: \u201CReally play down your Americanness,\
  \ this place can be a rough\u201D. Celtic, the team we were seeing, he told us,\
  \ brawled over Catholic versus Protestant anger. Glasgow, if you were to believe\
  \ Justin, was the 1970\u2019s Bronx, even though the pub had WiFi.\n In the cab\
  \ to the pitch, I tried to remove any stink the Boy Scouts, public school and Brian\
  \ Wilson had left on me. We had time to kill. Justin suggested another pint at a\
  \ pub. Walking into the pub was daunting, hundreds of drunk Celtic fans singing\
  \ with the intensity of a Baptist choir. It was lit to the level of a first Valentine\u2019\
  s dinner. We had defaulted into a round-buying afternoon and I was up. I squeezed\
  \ through a forest of men in green soccer kit to the bar. Not since I had a fake\
  \ ID had I been this terrified of ordering a beer. \n\u201CWhat yae haf\u2019\u2019\
  \u201D barked a mountain of a man with cheeks that suggested he had just come in\
  \ from playing pond hockey. \n\u201CThree Guinness, please.\u201D At least I remembered\
  \ my manners. \n\u201CAre yae American?\u201D he cross-examined me.\n\u201CYesssir,\
  \ I\u2019I\u2019I\u2019m from New Jersey.\u201D I Bob Newhart stammered. He left.\
  \ A 9-month pregnant pause later he returned, with a megaphone. In one move, this\
  \ massive man hopped on the bar with grace. \n\u201CYae not gonna believe it, We\
  \ haf someone from New Jersey,\u201D he announced. The only time I had heard New\
  \ Jersey said with more scorn was from women on Upper East Side. The pub became\
  \ still. Was the mob about to attack me? Will I see my end on the streets of Glasgow?\
  \ Will I never see New Jersey again? \nHe continued, \u201CAnd he\u2019s here to\
  \ support Celtic!\u201D His gruff voice softened with genuine enthusiasm. The entire\
  \ pub erupted in cheers of support.  \nCeltic fans started coming up to tell me\
  \ about their family who lived in Mahwah, Princeton or Toms River. They shared their\
  \ love of the Sopranos and Springsteen. We sang songs and made friends. I was no\
  \ longer homesick. I was in Glasgow."
