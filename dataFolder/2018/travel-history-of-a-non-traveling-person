Text: "My morning has started as always: the alarm sound, white crumpled bedclothes,\
  \ dimmed light, that was trying to reach through the heavy curtains. The cage. There\u2019\
  s no other word to describe it. Well, actually there\u2019s no sense in using substitutions\
  \ when all ingenious is already known \u2013 THE CAGE. \u201CHow it could even be\
  \ a cage when you are able to leave it every moment?\u201D \u2013 you would say.\
  \ And you\u2019d be right. I can leave it. I just have nowhere to go. Sometimes\
  \ the cage can be imaginative, pictured only in our head. It is wrapped with barbed\
  \ wire and it doesn\u2019t let you go somewhere else. Dark and unknown world awaits\
  \ behind it. You get used to this dimmed light of a candle, which is put on your\
  \ table. You get used to crumpled bedclothes and the lack of sun. As the time passes\
  \ by, you\u2019ve got this feeling of calm and safeness, and finally \u2013 the\
  \ feeling of comfort and you don\u2019t want to look for an escape anymore.  \n\
  It was like this yesterday. I\u2019m going to tell you how it is now.\nMy morning\
  \ has started not like every other mornings. Rhythms of music were heard outside\
  \ the window \u2013 energetic and fast ones. I had this feeling of jumping off the\
  \ bed, running out into the street and starting dancing there. The smell of roasted\
  \ peanuts. The sun dazzled and burned through the thin curtains. The morning of\
  \ my dream. I was on the plane not long ago, but today I\u2019m here \u2013 in the\
  \ city of \u201Cgood aires\u201D. How I turned to be here? Because only yesterday\
  \ I sat in my cage waiting for someone to bring me a mouse not to die of hunger.\
  \ I was waiting for an hour, then for two, but no one has showed up. I started to\
  \ worry. My comfort zone seemed to be not so comfort. The chain was interrupted.\
  \ Something\u2019s wrong.\nAnd now I have this choice: to start acting now or die\
  \ of a hunger. I stepped to the doors. Which were open all the time. Even the lock\
  \ is missing. When you look closer you realize that that wasn\u2019t even the doors.\
  \ Just the hole in the cage. Why I was so blind earlier to notice that? I stepped\
  \ even closer. I have to make a decision. There\u2019s dark and obscurity behind\
  \ the doors. What if there\u2019s the end, abyss?  am in heaven, but I\u2019m alive.\
  \ One step, one decision, one \u201Cyes\u201D can change your tomorrow\u2019s morning.\
  \ Your cage is so cozy and dear to you that you don\u2019t want to leave it, but\
  \ if you\u2019re a bird, you have to fly. To the West, to the East, to the South,\
  \ to the North. You have to fly. The doors are always open for you."
