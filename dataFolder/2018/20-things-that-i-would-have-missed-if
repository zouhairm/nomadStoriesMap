Text: "Once upon some 800 kilometers, I was about to realize one of my many random\
  \ life choices: volunteering a month as a I-don't-really-know-what in a hostel in\
  \ Czech Republic, on my own.\n800 kilometers after, I am safe, sound and have a\
  \ special \"List of the 20 things that I would have missed if\". Let's go.\n1. Learning\
  \ how to prepare gnocchi thanks to a Canadian chef\n2. Cooking for 70 people without\
  \ knowing how to do it (but, at least, I didn't poison anybody)\n3. ... Burning\
  \ a plastic tray in the oven\n4. Receiving a hand-mixer from home, in order to be\
  \ able to accomplish the Tiramis\xF9 mission\n5. Play in front of those same 70\
  \ people. More and more nights. Without deafening anybody\n6. Eating pancakes every\
  \ single day, risking to become a giant pancake myself\n7. Learning how to cook\
  \ healthy dishes as well, just not to completely turn into a blonde whale\n8. Substituting\
  \ beer for water, since half a liter of the good one is only 10 crowns \n9. Laying\
  \ down on an empty Charles Bridge at 3 a.m.\n10. Dying my favorite roommate's hair\
  \ pink (and cleaning up the crime scene with liters of nail polish remover)\n11.\
  \ Breaking a foot and then the other one, because I'm becoming old and my bones\
  \ too\n12. Trying to be a blogger with the only aid of a Czech, Windows XP and not-exactly-fast\
  \ computer\n13. Being celebrated with \"Happy birthday\" songs even days and days\
  \ after my actual birthday\n14. Becoming friends with the loveliest dog-tourguides\
  \ ever\n15. Starting with a cappuccino, and ending up drinking vodka shots at 3\
  \ p.m.\n16. Witness an Australian roommate killing a giant spider with her bare\
  \ hands\n17. Wandering from Antikv\xE1riat to Antikv\xE1riat, in search for rare\
  \ second-hand books\n18. Saying goodbye to Google Maps, in order to get lost and\
  \ find myself in marvelous hidden places\n19. Preparing sangria with cheap wine,\
  \ pouring it into a giant beer bucket and drinking it through balloon sticks\n20.\
  \ Not certainly last and not certainly least, feeling appreciated for what I do,\
  \ and, above all, for what I am.\n\nAll in all, travelling may not make you live\
  \ longer, but, certainly, it will make you live wider. Have the courage to distance\
  \ yourself - in space and time - from home. And if, in the meanwhile, you understood\
  \ you wanted to stay, just stay. You will never be too far from home. Otherwise,\
  \ you'll need a very, very, very good reason to go back home... Now you know it."
