Text: "My alarm clock used to ring every morning at seven. I used to catch the same\
  \ metro to go to work where I always met the same sad people. Then, in a wintry\
  \ morning my life changed forever. That morning I missed my usual metro. A young\
  \ Cuban boy was seated next to me; he was chatting with a friend. He told her about\
  \ his afternoons riding horses, the Sundays spent playing in a little cave, half\
  \ an hour of torrential rain, his brothers who are still playing with small sticks\
  \ taken from trees and his old grandmother who takes care of her illnesses with\
  \ medicinal herbs.\nThe young boy's voice had echoed in my mind all throughout the\
  \ day, so the following day I waited for the second metro hoping to meet him. He\
  \ was sitting in the same place. I sat beside him and asked him to tell me something\
  \ more about his land. He smiled and started telling me more about his old grandmother\
  \ and how she gets up early in the morning to collect the eggs from the hens and\
  \ prepare breakfast for her grandchildren. \"She has always been the pivot point\
  \ of the family\" he said, \"Just imagine that few years ago a terrible storm lasted\
  \ a whole week? The streets were completely flooded and the mud covered everything,\
  \ it was almost impossible to leave the house. Children were happy, they didn't\
  \ realize all the damage that the bad weather was causing. The animals were starving\
  \ and the mice ran out into the streets and entered the houses bringing illness.\n\
  When the rain stopped, it was difficult to get back to everyday activities. The\
  \ few people who owned a car put it at the disposal of the village although there\
  \ was a shortage of petrol. Food was lacking too. So my grandmother gathered the\
  \ whole village together and gave each person a task. Within a few weeks everything\
  \ was back to normal. Now we are connected to big cities and near the minimarket\
  \ there is a bus stop with a roof \". I was speechless. \"My grandma has decided\
  \ to rent my room to travelers. If you decide to visit Cuba, here\u2019s the address\"\
  \ and he wrote it down on a piece of paper. I immediately put it in my pocket. \"\
  I'm sorry but I have to go now!\" and he got off the metro, bringing me back to\
  \ reality.\nI was late for work but I was so happy and carefree! I took my phone\
  \ out of my pocket and I made the two most important calls of my life. I went home,\
  \ I collected some clothes and I caught a taxi directly to the airport.\nFrom that\
  \ day on, I still hear the story of the young boy's grandmother told by a single\
  \ narrative voice: her voice!"
