Text: "The sun beat down with oppressive force as I crawled out from underneath the\
  \ broken car and wiped the sweat from my forehead. A realization slowly washed over\
  \ me. Here, in the middle of the Ugandan savanna, James and I were stranded.\n\n\
  I tried to ignore the thoughts racing through my mind: This was lion country. We\
  \ hadn't seen another car in ages, and we were far too close to an area of the Congo\
  \ that had seen a recent surge in terrorism. Fantastic.\n\nWe managed to hitchhike\
  \ to the nearest ranger station, where Ranger Margaret swapped out her AK-47 for\
  \ a cell phone and called some mechanics. But by nightfall, the work was still incomplete.\
  \ The men told us to give them our keys so they could sit safely inside the car\
  \ while the motorbike took us back to the station for the night. Every fiber of\
  \ my being told me this was a bad idea, but with lions and poachers nearby, it was\
  \ a fair ask. We ignored our New York instincts and put our faith in three men we'd\
  \ hardly met. Without knowing so much as their names, we handed over the keys, and\
  \ they assured us we'd see them in the morning.\n\nAt the ranger station, we were\
  \ offered a storage shed for the night. Sleep came instantly. We awoke ten hours\
  \ later to the sound of goats bleating and Ranger Emanuel doing his morning calisthenics.\
  \ We had boisterous conversation punctuated with African handshakes while waiting\
  \ for our ride. But as the agreed-upon time came and went, once again my faith was\
  \ tested. Thirty minutes late. Forty-five. An hour.\n\nAs my anxiety reached a fever\
  \ pitch, suddenly Margaret yelled out, \u201CHey, you guys want elephants?\u201D\
  \n\nThere they were: the very first wild elephants either of us had ever seen, marching\
  \ single-file across the savanna. Fifteen of them. We were speechless. The big,\
  \ brash Alabamian next to me couldn't hold back tears. And as if on cue, the very\
  \ last elephant had just lumbered out of sight when I heard the familiar hum of\
  \ a motorbike engine.\n\nAn hour later, we were back on the road.\n\nWhen I think\
  \ of that day, I can't separate it from the word faith. Not that kind of faith,\
  \ but faith in people. Faith in yourself. An almost blind, nearly reckless faith\
  \ that things will work out if you're willing to let go of the controls and put\
  \ your trust in others. Uganda rewarded us for our faith, and I'll always be grateful\
  \ to that car for breaking down where and when it did. If it hadn't, we would've\
  \ missed out on the best Uganda had to offer.\n\nAnd the elephants. We would've\
  \ missed the elephants."
