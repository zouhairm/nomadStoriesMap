Text: "Hungover, sunburnt, nursing a couple of recently infected wounds and staring\
  \ up at the steamy slopes of one of Indonesias' tallest volcanoes, Gunung Rinjani,\
  \ was not an ideal way to start what would be a 2 day hike up a 3.7 km high behemoth.\
  \ Shouldering my backpack, trying hard not to grimace as the backpack reminded me\
  \ exactly where my sunburn was, I took the first step in what was to surely be a\
  \ gruelling trek. \n\nTo kick off what would be a 2 year round the world trip, I\
  \ had been robbed while on a moped in Kuta, Bali. Hitting the road at 40 Kph had\
  \ left me with a few scratches. I had also had my card scammed a few days after\
  \ the robbery, but, like the good nomad I was, these were merely notches in my belt\
  \ of travel stories. \n\nIt was when my recently acquired travel buddies and I were\
  \ languishing in splendour on the nearby Gili islands, throwing back more than a\
  \ few Bintangs, that we had the idea to climb Rinjani. Stumbling our way over to\
  \ one of the many 'travel agencies' that lined the sandy esplanade, we booked our\
  \ trip for the next day and made our way back to the comfort of our beers. \n\n\
  This simple decision, possibly made with a little bit of dutch courage, turned out\
  \ to be one of the most challenging experiences in my travels to date. Setting off\
  \ under the Indonesian sun, we approached what would be the first of many steep\
  \ inclines. My shoes, a pair of old volleys, did not seem up to the challenge at\
  \ first, and my infected toe throbbed with every step. Seeing our porters scramble\
  \ up these slopes in nothing but thongs, laughing and joking the whole way, was\
  \ a great boost to my confidence. However, about 3 hours in, I started to notice\
  \ the first signs of exhaustion set in. Asking one of the porters how far we had\
  \ to go, he dashed my confidence when he told me it was another 7 hours to the base\
  \ camp, from where we would begin the summit trek, of another 4 or 5 hours, after\
  \ a short sleep of course. Possibly seeing the colour drain from my face he simply\
  \ smiled and said to take it 'satu per satu' or one by one. It was with this mantra\
  \ revolving in my head that I overcame complete exhausiton, a hangover, sunburn,\
  \ high altitude and lack of sleep that I was able to summit Rinjani, catching it\
  \ just as the sun rose. The trek to the summit had taken us a total of 14 hours,\
  \ with only a short sleep in between. It was exhausting and difficult but amazingly\
  \ exhilirating to see that sunrise - all I have to thank is that one porter telling\
  \ me 'satu per satu'."
