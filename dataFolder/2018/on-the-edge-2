Text: "My heart beating hard I try to look down the steepest slope of Hida Takayama\
  \ ski resort. I can\u2019t believe it! How did I, the girl who grew up fearing ice,\
  \ end up here on the highest hill of these mountains covered with snow? \u201CIt\u2019\
  s ok. Just calm down! You can do it.\u201D \u2013 I tell to myself, but I know I\
  \ am bound to slide down this 35 degree 1547 m high mountain. Only yesterday I was\
  \ one of those millions of people who have never tried skiing \u2013 dreadfully\
  \ fearing ice. \nIt\u2019s not that I am afraid of height, I have never been afraid\
  \ of height. On the contrary, all my life I have been afraid of anything slippery.\
  \ \nWhen I first heard about the ski-trip of Nagoya University where I studied as\
  \ an exchange student I was 100% sure I wouldn\u2019t attend it. Later, I made the\
  \ decision that pushed me to the edge. So, I did decide to go there. I read somewhere\
  \ the best way to get out of your fear is to try it. Then you will see that nothing\
  \ truly serious happens which will lead you to overcome that fear. This is how I\
  \ decided to get free of one my fears.\nWhen we reached Hida Takayama the view was\
  \ breathtaking just like one of those fairy-tale snow pictures with a big house\
  \ and trees around deeply covered with snow.\nAfter about half an hour of first\
  \ instructions I finally was there trying to do my first ever slide on ski. I learnt\
  \ that if I pose my legs in a triangle shape bending the front a bit inwards, I\
  \ would slide slowly. My heart pumping from fear, I had to slide down as everyone\
  \ was waiting for me. So, I gave myself a little push and I was sliding gently \u2013\
  \ and after some time I was flying gently and smoothly. \nThis was my first ever\
  \ slide in my life. \nThis is how I ended up on the highest point of this ski resort\
  \ hearing my heart bumping through the nerves near my ears. I had to go really close\
  \ to the edge to see where it led. Our instructor was encouraging us to try it when\
  \ some of the other members of our elementary group decided to go down on the rope\
  \ way instead of sliding. I was also pondering for a moment what to do: First, I\
  \ am sure I cannot do it; second, I am grateful I haven\u2019t broken any part of\
  \ me yet, but I\u2019m not sure if I will be ok after this; third, I will have betrayed\
  \ myself if I don\u2019t try it.\nI gave myself a push both mentally and physically\
  \ and I was flying again! This time I was truly flying because I was light, open\
  \ to novelty, free from fear."
