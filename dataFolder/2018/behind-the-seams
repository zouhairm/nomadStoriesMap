Text: "I knew it was clich\xE9, a woven proclamation of who I was: just another tourist.\n\
  You could find one in any assortment of colors, stockpiled at street booths within\
  \ travelers\u2019 reach. My hostel roommate wore hers unabashedly, a number crafted\
  \ with red hues that matched her hair.\nIt was a stitched emblem of the \u2018nomadic\
  \ twenty-something\u2019 stereotype. But so help me, I wasn\u2019t leaving Peru\
  \ without an alpaca-patterned sweater.\nThe chance to fulfill that promise came\
  \ the day after I arrived in Cusco, when dawn ushered in a gripping chill. Bearing\
  \ no knowledge of the city, I wandered with goosebumps on my arms. Only when I spotted\
  \ stacks of garments inside one tent, nearly touching its ceiling, did I pause to\
  \ look around. Each creased piece of apparel, tidily arranged, spoke to the efforts\
  \ of meticulous hands.\n\u201CIt is a lot to choose from.\u201D A wild-haired woman,\
  \ folding a shirt down the aisle, noticed my awe.\n\u201CYes\u2026I need a sweater,\
  \ but I don\u2019t know which to pick!\u201D I replied. A grey style, decorated\
  \ with large alpacas, caught my eye. Another was the same, but a lighter shade.\
  \ She pointed at the former. The sleeves were a bit short, but gloves would keep\
  \ my wrists warm.\nMy hand drifted to my coin purse. \u201CHow much do I owe you?\u201D\
  \ I asked.\n\u201COh, I don\u2019t work here,\u201D she responded. \u201CBut I know\
  \ the owner.\u201D I followed her towards the front, where the owner rested on a\
  \ stool\u2014I must have looked right past her when I walked in.\nShe was no more\
  \ than eight years old. \u201CHola,\u201D she greeted me. Her face bore the cherubic\
  \ softness of youth, but was chapped from the elements.\n\u201CShe\u2019s running\
  \ the business, to support her family.\u201D The woman read my expression.\n\u201C\
  By herself\u2026why?\u201D I could merely shake my head. But the answer was obvious,\
  \ and one shared by many merchants: survival compels them; grit sustains them. Neither\
  \ condition has an age limit.\nShe, a girl already familiar with sacrifice, silently\
  \ met my gaze. I could only ask again, \u201CHow much do I owe you?\u201D\nHer voice\
  \ was small, but firm, reflecting the unspoken hardships that placed her in a role\
  \ beyond her years. \u201CTwenty-five soles.\" A steal, but she refused to take\
  \ any more when I protested. Instead, she gifted me a pin and a quick smile with\
  \ my purchase.\nThe sun's ascent had shooed the morning chill, but I shrugged on\
  \ the sweater as I walked away. Passersby would inevitably think, \u2018Another\
  \ tourist, another alpaca sweater.\u2019 But I was at peace with being a walking\
  \ clich\xE9. For me, it was the unexpected reminder of a young girl\u2019s fortitude."
