Text: "I was nearing the end of my 2 and half month Eurotrip of 2017, ready to head\
  \ back to Canada; a place I call home. The beginning of my travels started off with\
  \ such wanderlust and full of exploration. \n\nThe entire adventure wasn\u2019t\
  \ all glorious. I was scammed for 125 Euros in Paris ad robbed of my iPad and 400\
  \ Euros in Amsterdam early into my journey. Was the the rest of my journey going\
  \ to be this bad? Should I pack up and head home now? \u201CI must continue on.\u201D\
  \ I kept telling myself. \u201CSomething amazing is going to happen!\u201D\n\nI\
  \ continued on my journey south to Spain and ended up in Barcelona. This may have\
  \ been the best thing that had ever happened to me for many reasons. The hostel\
  \ I stay at had the friendliest, most welcoming people a solo traveler could look\
  \ for. But what happened next was the last thing I expected.\n\nSee my entire travels,\
  \ I had never been looking for love, or lust, or even one night stands. Just a man\
  \ on his journey to find himself (or so I thought). With only three days left in\
  \ Barcelona, I met a girl. Dirty blonde hair, light blue eyes, tan, from New York.\
  \ She was not the most attractive person, but something about her made me want to\
  \ talk to her.\n\nWe started off with basic small talk and chatting about travels.\
  \ I explained to her that I lived in Korea teaching for some time and she explained\
  \ how she always wanted to go. We exchanged Facebook accounts and grabbed lunch\
  \ together. \nOver lunch, we had the most incredible chats about how we didn\u2019\
  t want to live the stereotypical way of life\u2026 get married, have kids, have\
  \ a mortgage, work, retire, get old and die. Our minds were totally in sync. Was\
  \ this my soulmate? \nFor the next 2 days we hung out at the beach and bars together,\
  \ never in a sexual manner as the conversation was too incredible to get passed.\
  \ I told her that I had a flight booked to Budapest the next day. \n\nI laid awake\
  \ all night before my flight contemplating not leaving and seeing if this was my\
  \ true soulmate. As I laid there, I messaged her on Facebook asking her if she thought\
  \ it would be a good idea for me to stay, hoping that she would say yes.  \n\nThe\
  \ AM came and I had no response. So I left. I left with doubt and wonder about what\
  \ the future could have held. I will always reflect on this moment in time, with\
  \ this girl, and the amazing conversation we had. In that time I learned so much\
  \ about myself. \n\nSo thank you my lost soul mate. Although nothing came to be,\
  \ you will always be in my heart and mind as someone who truly changed my life."
