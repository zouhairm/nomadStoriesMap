Text: "It was my first taste of the dolphins\u2019 capacity for curious co-existence.\
  \ Half an hour into searching for whales in the Trincomalee harbour a scorching\
  \ sun had melted all enthusiasm. Until that hysterical gasp from the boatman. \n\
  \nSix dolphins arched out of the  water. They surfaced again in another glittering\
  \ arc, pirouetting as they leapt. The boatman swung the little fibreglass craft\
  \ wildly to keep track as they\u2019d leap up ahead and the next moment glide beneath\
  \ our bow. Who was pursuer, who pursued, never clear. They didn\u2019t seem to want\
  \ to lose us nor did we want to lose them!\n\nNext evening I put my camera away\
  \ just wanting to relax. We puttered into the inner harbour. \nThe quiet beauty\
  \ of dusk enfolded the bay. The world slept in heavenly peace - and suddenly - again-\
  \ the dolphins leapt. A pair. Courting couple perhaps? No question of pursuit. They\
  \ clearly wished to stay, as they leapt and wove around the boat. \n \nFrenziedly\
  \ I donned fins. Flipped overboard, doomed to damp disappointment. The tortoise\
  \ cannot run with the hare. I swore that I\u2019d left my camera at home.\n\nMeanwhile,\
  \ the dolphin dance was gathering momentum. Round and around our boat they swam\
  \ in a tight circle following the contours of the bay, They dived and surfaced and\
  \ wove around each other in joyous communion with the grace and flamboyance of a\
  \ ballroom duo. We sat spellbound until the moving shapes melted into dusk. The\
  \ stars hung above as we shook ourselves to affirm our own reality in this surreally\
  \ beautiful ballroom of the deep. \n\nSadly the dolphins trust and curiosity can\
  \ be its undoing in encounters with man.\nThe closest I got to a dolphin was when\
  \ we found a flotilla of small craft hovering around an animal injured by the rudder\
  \ of a boat. Confused, the creature raced to the shallows and into a scrum of scrambling\
  \ villagers and flying foam.\n\nPolice drove the crowd back. Only the dolphin, two\
  \ men supporting it, and myself, were left in the water.\n\nI was able to touch\
  \ a dolphin at last\u2026 to stroke its silky smooth wet grey skin as it lay resting\
  \ on our arms, puffing painfully and noisily, a six inch gash above its blowhole..\
  \ The last thing I expected was to embrace a dying dolphin in my arms.\n\nWhat do\
  \ you do to relieve a dolphin desperately hurt, when the nearest doctor, let alone\
  \ vet, may be miles away? The two villagers decided the issue. They bore the creature\
  \ to deeper water and let it free.\n\nFour days later, a dolphin with a gash on\
  \ its blowhole washed up on a nearby beach, dead."
