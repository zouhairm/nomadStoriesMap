Text: "The train Moscow \u2013 Beijing was carrying us through 6,000 kilometers of\
  \ taiga, abandoned fields and towns, still full of communist slogans. The wagon\
  \ was packed with Chinese, keeping illegal dogs under the seats. Our compartment\
  \ however was comfortably empty \u2013 just me and a German, with a silver beard,\
  \ manicured fingers and a boyish smile. He immediately started chatting with me,\
  \ and after 1 day I became an expert in the turning points of his biography: a successful\
  \ surgeon career, a mansion near Swiss border, a childless marriage, exotic holidays\
  \ twice a year\u2026 My 20-year-old ego was flattered: this handsome, mature man\
  \ was sharing his life story with me! \nAfter 4 days travelling and countless hours\
  \ of funny stories, romantic songs, walks in chilly Siberian air, dozens of sandwiches,\
  \ litres of tea, we arrived in Transbaikal, where we were to cross the border. We\
  \ were supposed to spend the whole day there, waiting for the wheels to be changed.\
  \ Everything was just fine, until they announced, that Russian money could not be\
  \ transported across the border. My new friend had an incredible amount of rubles\
  \ \u2013 back in the 1990s it was equal of my parents` salary for 10 years. \xAB\
  No problem,\xBB I said, \xABwe can find a bank\xBB. And we set out. It was the ugliest\
  \ place I had ever seen, with many storehouses and fences, but no bank. \xABOk,\xBB\
  \ he said. \xABLet`s spend it!\xBB We headed for the only restaurant and ordered\
  \ the most expensive dishes they had, but what we spent was nothing compared to\
  \ what was left. I suggested hiding the money on me, but he refused \xABto break\
  \ the law\xBB. \nSuddenly his face brightened. \xABI know, what I`ll do,\xBB he\
  \ said happily. \xABI`ll leave a gift for a poor craftsman of this little town.\
  \ Imagine, at Christmas he will find this money and buy presents for his nice little\
  \ wife!\xBB He picked up a piece of an old newspaper, wrapped the money and fastened\
  \ it to a cracked telegraph pole with rusty wire. My God, it seemed a complete madness\
  \ in this nowhere, full of drunkards and swindlers, with a nasty continental climate!\
  \ I was shocked, like a Dostoevsky character, watching a fortune being burnt in\
  \ front of me. \nIt took me long to recover. I could not stand my travel-mate`s\
  \ voice, savoring the details of the \xABgood deed\xBB over and over again. I could\
  \ not even look at him, at his watery shiny eyes and  a complacent smile. The remaining\
  \ 3 days of the trip I spent embracing illegal puppies, tasting Chinese food and\
  \ practicing  putunxua. Meanwhile the train was running forward."
