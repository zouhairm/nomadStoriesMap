Text: "It was the first day. While not a morning person, I was captivated by the way\
  \ the dense trees followed the curves of the mountain-scape on that bright morning.\
  \ Our driver told us we were getting close.\n\nThey called it the Duckling Daycare.\
  \ Nestled on a hill surrounded by crumbling houses held together with wire and corrugated\
  \ metal, a small painting of a swan and her ducklings was the only way to be sure\
  \ we were at the right place. My stomach was in knots as our driver slid open the\
  \ van door. \n\nI had barely stepped out on the gravel when we were met with a cheery\
  \ \u201CBuenos Dias!\u201D and a Spanish woman enveloping us in a hug - this woman\
  \ who two weeks later I\u2019d be laughing with and calling \u2018Tia\u2019.  \n\
  \nDespite the rough exterior, the inside was bright and welcoming. While not in\
  \ the best shape, the kids\u2019 artwork covered up holes and cracks in the wall\
  \ and gave the room a homey feel. \n\nI looked around the room at the group of beautiful\
  \ Costa Rican children sitting in a circle singing songs. I tuned out the chatter\
  \ happening next to me between my fluent friend and 'Tia'. That was when I saw her.\
  \ \n\nLet\u2019s call her Dolly. She had come strolling into the playroom, bottle\
  \ in one hand, crayons in the other and the most adorable smile you have ever seen.\
  \ I felt my anxiety dissolve. As she came toward me I knelt down and introduced\
  \ myself in my best Spanish. She smiled and toddled off to join her friends. An\
  \ older girl with the same dark hair and eyes as the little one looked at me and\
  \ said with a grin, \u201CMi hermana es timida!\u201D and went back to her drawing.\
  \ I knew enough basic Spanish to know she said \u2018shy\u2019 and \u2018sister\u2019\
  . \n\nDays later, Dolly and I were building and rebuilding the same puzzles, counting\
  \ to five in English and making macaroni necklaces. Each morning after that first\
  \ day, I jumped out the van and scooped Dolly up. Her giggles reminding me of the\
  \ reason I wanted to volunteer to begin with. \n\nTwo weeks flew by faster than\
  \ ever and on the last day I had the same feeling in my stomach as before. I wasn\u2019\
  t ready for goodbyes. All the children at the daycare had brought such joy to my\
  \ life in a short period of time, especially Dolly. With her big brown eyes, heart-melting\
  \ smile and sassy three-year-old attitude, I had no doubt she'd be the one I'd miss\
  \ most. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t until I was on the flight home that it hit me. I embarked\
  \ on the trip with a goal to make a difference in someone\u2019s life. The last\
  \ thing I expected was how much she would make a difference in mine..."
