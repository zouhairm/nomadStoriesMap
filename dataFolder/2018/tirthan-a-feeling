Text: "Slothful days spent either in the lap of Morpheus or climbing mango trees with\
  \ time to kill are now over. Today summer holidays mean trips to the Himalayan foothills,\
  \ the Gauley river of West Virginia, or the Victoria Falls where specialised skills\
  \ are learnt in a structured manner- trekking, mountain biking, etc. So when I heard\
  \ about the Youreka camps that excelled in arranging similar trips I couldn\u2019\
  t resist myself from being a part of one of such trips and dug up everything I could,\
  \ about these camps. There wasn\u2019t anything on their website that didn\u2019\
  t enchant me and in a jiffy, me and my friends booked our seats for the Tirthan\
  \ Valley trip that took place in mid of May, consisting of 9 days.\n\nSituated besides\
  \ the Tirthan river at an altitude of 1600 meters, Tirthan Valley is a place where\
  \ you can easily forget the world, to relax and have loads of nature walks following\
  \ one trail or the other, into the woods or besides the river.\n\nOur trip package\
  \ included distinctive variety of adventure sports and the one first in line was\
  \ Outdoor Survival. So for the same we were taken to the wilderness which was miles\
  \ away from our camp. We reached there after trekking for two hours which was hectic\
  \ but fun. In those two days we stayed there, we cooked on the fire made by lighting\
  \ up the logs we cut, tossed stones into the lakes, made our own tents, danced and\
  \ sang around the campfire. \n\nComing back to camp, our days were lined up with\
  \ water sports like river crossing, cliff diving, etc. River crossing looked dangerous\
  \ at first but as we did it, it turned out to be a piece of cake. Only the moment\
  \ when you are in the middle where the current is highest, you will catch goose\
  \ bumps in your whole body, but the harness attached to the rope and our jackets\
  \ prevented any risks. Then came cliff diving, which was the craziest sport of all\
  \ where we jumped from a huge rock into high currents of the river with the harness\
  \ attached of course. \nOur nights were occupied by the creative and fun games at\
  \ the campfire where we performed in groups and as each day different groups were\
  \ formed, we were able to interact with everyone in the camp. Waterfall sliding\
  \ was the best sport that we took part in, where we were taken to the top of a smaller\
  \ waterfall and suited up. One by one, we began sliding. As we came with speed,\
  \ everyone touched the surface of stream when we came down.\n\n\_In the raw confines\
  \ of mother nature, you get intoxicated by the pure air and just feel alive and\
  \ free."
