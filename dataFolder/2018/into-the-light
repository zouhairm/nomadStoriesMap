Text: "I heard a small shriek up ahead of me. My heart sped up and I tried to shuffle\
  \ along a little more quickly than I was going already. I rounded the narrow, dark\
  \ corner, and found other members of our tour group blinking up at me as my headlamp\
  \ blinded them. \"Good thing you were close by we dropped our torch in the water.\"\
  \ Connie pointed to the other couple, \"And they lost theirs as soon as they entered.\"\
  \ I nodded feeling the responsibility of so many people on my shoulders.  I could\
  \ feel all the sequestered fear I'd shoved deep into my vault of \"Just don't think\
  \ about it\u2026\"  burbling back up. \"Deep breaths I reminded myself. In and out.\"\
  \ I exhaled forcefully every time just to release my extra stress. I longed for\
  \ my girlfriend, we'd just started dating, whom I'd left as she was preparing to\
  \ cliff jump again into a dark, bottomless, whirlpool. Talk about fearless, I hoped\
  \ she thought me nearly as impressive. Bats whistle by and over our heads. I shrug\
  \ my shoulders and decide to push on. My next step lands my foot in a diagonal crevice.\
  \ It's also brought the river water up to my chest. I feel little fish swishing\
  \ around my legs and hands as I slowly extract my foot. We all move a little bit\
  \ more slowly since I'm the lone light. We moved slow enough that my girlfriend\
  \ caught up to us. \"Hey! I found\u2026. How about you come over here a second.\"\
  \ Her facial expression of happiness changing to one of unease and fear. I followed\
  \ her advice no questions asked. I knew asking would only result in further panic.\
  \ Just smile and breathe. She brushes something off my stomach and grabs my hand.\
  \ \"Let's get out of here!\" I second that motion and quickly, it was still pretty\
  \ slow, follow the slimy walls that guide us to our exit. It's hard to notice at\
  \ first but I begin to see a pinprick of bright light ahead of me. That light was\
  \ my Holy Grail. And I'll admit I ran the rest of the way out of that deep, dark\
  \ throat that had swallowed my eight companions and me. Once outside in the jungle,\
  \ I quite literally sat down and prayed a prayer of gratitude. I also stood a little\
  \ prouder that day. The score was officially caves five me one; but after 25 years\
  \ of fighting that fear one triumph was enough. I guess love does conquer all after\
  \ all."
