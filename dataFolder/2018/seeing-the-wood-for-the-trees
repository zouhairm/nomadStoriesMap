Text: "As I drove along the twisting, single-lane road, all around me bright green\
  \ saplings were injecting colour into an otherwise brown landscape. The baby trees\
  \ were Scots Pine, and their viridian needles contrasted brilliantly with the blue\
  \ skies behind them. The sight of these conifers impacted me suddenly and powerfully,\
  \ but my time amongst this nascent forest was short-lived. After less than a kilometre\
  \ the road crossed a cattle grid and we returned to a habitat that was not protected\
  \ from Cervus elaphus, the red deer.\nAlmost anyone who has spent much time in the\
  \ Scottish Highlands will be aware of the debates that surround Britain\u2019s largest\
  \ wild animal. To the tourists and visitors, those still living under the spell\
  \ of Victorian romantics, a glimpse of the \u2018Monarch of the Glen\u2019 is often\
  \ the highlight of their trip. Mature stags, with elaborate, branched antlers silhouetted\
  \ against the skyline, do look magnificent and all the more so to those conditioned\
  \ to embrace these animals unreservedly; native, natural components of the landscape,\
  \ the symbol of Scotland\u2019s \u2018wild\u2019.\nOn the flip side, for ecologists\
  \ and conservationists, deer in the highlands are a cause for concern. Many want\
  \ their numbers to be drastically culled, with solutions ranging from reintroducing\
  \ wolves to government-sponsored marksmen patrolling the glens and killing on sight.\
  \ While it may seem ironic that supposed champions of the natural world are the\
  \ ones endorsing the slaughter of wild animals, the paradox is explained by the\
  \ ecologists\u2019 view that the number of deer in Scotland is anything but natural.\
  \ Their population, bolstered by centuries without predation and by the support\
  \ of highland sporting estates, is an order of magnitude higher than it otherwise\
  \ would be. Vast herds of deer now trample over the wee bit hill and glen, stripping\
  \ the land young trees, locking the moorland\u2019s floral monoculture in place.\n\
  I have lived just south of the highlands for much of my life, frequently journeying\
  \ north to play tourist in my own backyard. For years, I\u2019ve known about the\
  \ deer debates and the arguments on both sides, but it wasn\u2019t until I drove\
  \ down Glen Lyon last spring, on a bright but windy day, that the gravity of the\
  \ issue clicked into place. The beauty, the naked optimism those young pines evoked\
  \ in me as they wriggled free of the heather, their evergreen leaves a shameless\
  \ display of life in a denuded place, was so stark. The rest of the landscape seemed\
  \ suddenly ruined in comparison."
