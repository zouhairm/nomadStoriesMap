Text: "The last thing I expected from our hiking trip to Peru was the persistence;\
  \ the trip changed who I am. At first thought, the assumed easy answer is that I\
  \ suffered a fall or some other malady and now have a chronic health issue. That\u2019\
  s not how it impacted me. Hiking Machu Picchu changed my relationship with my wife,\
  \ how I see other cultures and American culture, and finally it changed how I see\
  \ myself. It was a Pandora\u2019s box of self-revelation. \nPeru is a bi-polar country;\
  \ there are the cities and people of Spanish descent, and rural Peru and the people\
  \ of Incan (Quechan) descent. There are rich parts of the country, and poor parts\
  \ of the country. Lavishly ornate church altars, and the poor farmers who worship\
  \ there. Friendly people who want to meet you, and military vehicles guarding bank.\
  \ Beautifully engineered stone walls, and frustrating staircases designed for people\
  \ with very small feet. It's truly a country of contrasts, and it's the contrasts\
  \ that make you think. \nOur hike started uneventfully, and we were stricken by\
  \ the beauty and uniqueness of what we saw. But 8-10 hours each day of up and down\
  \ hiking will give you a lot of time to think about things. Or to suffer, if that's\
  \ in the cards. Maureen (my wife), damaged both of her big toes (both eventually\
  \ fell off and re-grew), and I had a visit from Montezuma (or whatever the Incan\
  \ ruler's name is that graces travelers gastroenteritis). Hiking under these conditions\
  \ is more than challenging. And when your wife realizes that she's suffering all\
  \ this because her husband picked a place he wanted to go and wrapped it up as her\
  \ birthday present, it gets even more challenging. I'm not a linguistics expert,\
  \ but I'd suggest interpreting \"challenging\" as meaning \"imminently life threatening\"\
  . A couple of falls on the rocks, a serious lack of caffeine and showers, and you\
  \ have an intercontinental melt down that threatened a Peruvian glacier. My head\
  \ still hurts remembering it. \nMy friends and family still laugh when they hear\
  \ this story. They laugh both at and with us, as I was an idiot to try and give\
  \ my wife what I wanted as a present. And they have seen a Maureen meltdown, so\
  \ they know the I'm not kidding about the glacier melting, \nWould I hike Machu\
  \ Piccu again? In a heart beat. I learned so much about myself, about my marriage,\
  \ and about Peru. It's a beautiful country and it was a phenomenal experience. It's\
  \ amazing how much I learned, and how much I changed, on one trip"
