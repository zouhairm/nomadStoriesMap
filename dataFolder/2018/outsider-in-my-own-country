Text: "I don\u2019t hear names of the 29 states, I hear just three syllables always\
  \ running through my body, India. I live in Delhi and had roamed around in all directions\
  \ but the Eastern parts of the country, seven states there are called the \u201C\
  Seven sisters\u201D, something our geography teacher would emphasize on. My moment\
  \ arrived when my favourite thrash metal band Megadeth decided to tour Bhoirymbong,\
  \ 40 kms away from Shillong, Meghalaya. I was excited to enjoy the concert in the\
  \ backdrop of the most beautiful settings of lush green hills, cold misty winds\
  \ and rain always ten minutes away.\nI lived in a shop in the village where the\
  \ infrastructure was such that it was strong wind away from eroding to ashes. I\
  \ would go to the village Chaupal and have tea with strangers still warming up to\
  \ the indifferent behaviour of the locals.\n\nIn my interactions I met Bihu, a college\
  \ student who was back to his hometown for the concert. He took me around the lush\
  \ green farms where people would farm, the sun would come in and out of the clouds.\
  \ I asked him, why wouldn\u2019t people talk to me properly. To which he replied\
  \ \u201CYou are an outsider.\u201D Bihu told me how the east was still ten years\
  \ behind from the rest of the country. He would compare how the Wagah border was\
  \ such a well decorated place with a parade ceremony taking place every day before\
  \ sunset. Four Northeast Indian states share the border with Burma yet very little\
  \ is done to safeguard their interests.\nHe shared with me the case of a local who\
  \ crossed paths and ended up in Burma unknowingly. The hearing to sentence him was\
  \ conducted in Burmese, he had no chance to defend himself since he didn\u2019t\
  \ understand a word he said. They showed him four fingers to tell him that he was\
  \ imprisoned for 4 months. \n\nThe Burma jails were not your normal jails. The prisoners\
  \ irrespective of men or women were not given proper clothes, half torn clothes\
  \ which were also their food plates. Women would not be given pads during menstrual\
  \ cycle. The term of four years is also not permanent. The officer who had you arrested\
  \ has to be present at the time of your release. If that officer is on a duty outside\
  \ the country you have to wait indefinitely till the time he is back. And if the\
  \ officer has died on duty you are imprisoned for life!\n\nI was baffled and could\
  \ not believe this human torture. A new unknown feeling of fear was instilled in\
  \ me. Even all the headbanging next day wouldn\u2019t make me forget the feeling\
  \ of being an outsider in my own country."
