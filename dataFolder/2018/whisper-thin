Text: "There\u2019s something emphatically comforting about putting things into categories.\
  \ The attempt to reclaim some form of order in a world that exists in a constant\
  \ state of shift is no less than an act of survival, allowing us to live with an\
  \ amount of certainty. We create facts that remain true until proven otherwise.\
  \ \n\nPemuteran, a village in northern Bali, Indonesia, promised to be in the \"\
  peaceful\", and \"idyllic\" category. Upon in arrival, I watched as the transmutation\
  \ of the surrounding environment heralded something darker. The busy roads carving\
  \ through the southern rice paddies soon gave way to drier terrain, occasionally\
  \ punctuated with patches of brownish vegetation. The air held a certain density\
  \ and the sun above hung in the sky with a burning clarity. Even the monkeys loping\
  \ through the trees on either side of the highway scrutinised me through the trees\
  \ with a gaze more piercing than their southern counterparts. \n\nThe next morning,\
  \ I woke with a start to hear a wail cutting through the silence. A throaty, almost\
  \ alien sounding voice projected an endless stream of modulation.  The mostly abandoned\
  \ gravel roads echoed eerily with the loudspeaker chanting, its source remaining\
  \ elusive. \nThe chanting felt like an immovable, and unflinching presence. It penetrated\
  \ every building, reverberated off every surface. The sound created an unsettling,\
  \ slightly dreamlike quality which seemed to envelop everything in the village:\
  \ a thin shroud settling over people and objects. \nThis dreamlike state was only\
  \ to intensify, due to the traditional Balinese funeral scheduled to take place\
  \ over the next few days.\n\nThe ceremony involved the whole extended family and\
  \ many village inhabitants gathering together for over a week to honour the dead\
  \ family member. As opposed to removing the corpse as soon as death arrives, the\
  \ body remains with the family for some time during this process. Loved ones wash\
  \ the body and tend to it, with as much care as if the individual were still alive.\
  \ It\u2019s a time in which life and death do not seem so far removed; when the\
  \ walls separating two states of being are revealed as a whisper-thin membrane.\n\
  \nA culture in which living with the dead is the norm showed me that coming to terms\
  \ with that which disturbs us can be approached with a sense of practical grace.\
  \ It showed me that life and death cannot be sorted into opposing categories. One\
  \ is merely an extension of the other. And that\u2019s a fact."
