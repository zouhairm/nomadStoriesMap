Text: "'Beware of criminals at the beach!' The notice at the reception desk of my\
  \ hotel had warned. \nI read it a second time, the only English text I had seen\
  \ since I arrived Lom\xE9. \nIt was a confirmation of stories I read on travel forums\
  \ before embarking on my trip. Frightening tales of attacks on Lom\xE9 beach towards\
  \ night time.\n\"Room.\" The receptionist said as she handed me a key. She didn't\
  \ speak English like every other person I had encountered. The only French words\
  \ I was familiar with were bonjour, merci and the statement 'je ne comprends pas\
  \ le fran\xE7ais' I memorised for emergencies.\n\"Merci.\" I said.\n\nIt was 6pm\
  \ when I set out to explore the city by foot. \nLom\xE9, a small city sits on the\
  \ southwest while the Atlantic Ocean stretches towards the southeast of the city.\
  \ I stood on the pavement in the middle of the coastal road, taking in my surroundings.\
  \ On the right side were men selling bottled petrols in roadside stalls, women returning\
  \ from the market with wares on their head, artworks adorned on the streets.\nOn\
  \ the left was a beautiful stretch of palm trees along the beach. Several chairs\
  \ made out of concrete were on the coastline and men were seen lying on them, their\
  \ motor bikes taking shade under the palm trees. \n\nDeciding which to explore between\
  \ left or right seemed like the hardest decision in the world. I watched three fishermen\
  \ pull their catch on the beach. I made my decision.\nI got off the pavement and\
  \ slowing made my way to the beachfront, walking past a group of local boys playing\
  \ soccer, their shadows cast along the shoreline while the sun was setting. It was\
  \ a powerful scene.\nI retrieved my mobile phone from my pocket and began taking\
  \ photos when I felt a hand on my back. \nI froze as I turned.\nThey were two of\
  \ them, shirtless, muscular and towering me by several inches. One spoke in French\
  \ and stretched out a hand towards me. \n\"Please don't hurt me. I have no money.\"\
  \ I said. I handed my mobile phone to him and made to run. He reached for my hands.\n\
  \"Madame, photo?\" He said gently. I understood. All they wanted was to take photos\
  \ with me and I allowed the stories I read misjudged their intentions.\n \nAs I\
  \ walked back to my hotel, I pondered on how much I was going to enjoy my stay if\
  \ I could overcome the language barriers. I headed for the hotel bar to pour myself\
  \ a drink.\nA local man walked up to my table and stretched out a hand for a handshake.\n\
  \"Bonjour.\" He said.\n\"Jay...ne.\" I stuttered.\n\"Oh, Jane.\" He said, smiling.\n\
  My name was Jane in Lom\xE9."
