Text: "I had a week that came from hell. The constant bickering and quarrels in my\
  \ parents\u2019 life over menial things kept them busy. And last week was a mess;\
  \ I almost begged my parents to stop it once and for all, else get separated. The\
  \ mid-life crisis that I thought was supposed to hit me in my thirties had arrived\
  \ in my early twenties and I was done with every excuse I had given myself for the\
  \ past 15 years about how a Wizard School in the UK is going to send me an acceptance\
  \ letter to teach me the highest scaffolds of magic or else I'll meet a young Jedi\
  \ Master and convince him to make me his Padawan. \nSo after constant chaos in my\
  \ house when a friend of mine asked if I was free to join him along with my gang\
  \ to a trip to Manali, my answer was yes even if I hated travelling. And believe\
  \ me; I packed my belongings without thinking for once. It was a 2 days and 2 night\
  \ stay at the high altitude town. I was amazed by the clear blue skies that ended\
  \ with the beginning of the pearl-white hills & it marked the beginning of the heavy\
  \ jungles of the Indian Terai. But I was mesmerized by the Snow clad valley that\
  \ lay untouched right behind our Cottage. On the first day we were introduced to\
  \ the constant unfolding of the Manali Marketplace. It had a \u2018word here\u2019\
  \ layout of shops. I had researched that Manali had its own unique blend of beer\
  \ made from fermented rice which is called as Lugdi. It\u2019s one of those things\
  \ recommended for a fellow drinker here. \nLuck favoured me because plans for the\
  \ second day were cancelled due to heavy snowfall and landslides along the hills.\
  \ So I, after almost drinking a whole bottle of Lugdi, decided to visit the vast\
  \ valley behind our cottage. All I could do was wonder just how magnificent the\
  \ view was, the asymmetrical symmetry of nature unfolding its true colour in front\
  \ of me. But I was coming to realise, that I wouldn\u2019t be here tomorrow to witness\
  \ the same magic unfold itself. And I felt the heart-melting anger, revolting emotions\
  \ and the cruel truth accompanied by pure pain come screaming out of my throat.\
  \ I screamed and screamed till I was free from the shackles of constant abandonment\
  \ and loneliness. And anger flowed through my eyes because I didn\u2019t wanted\
  \ to go back home and survive, I wanted to live here, because the last thing I expected\
  \ was to fall for something as majestic as this. Out of nowhere I felt a hand on\
  \ my shoulder. I didn\u2019t care to see whose it was, because for the first time\
  \ in my life I realised I was not alone."
