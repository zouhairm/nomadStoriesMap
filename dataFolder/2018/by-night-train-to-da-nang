Text: "The night train to Da Nang is anything but dull. Women in curlers smoke and\
  \ gamble all night, flirting with the police officer as he makes his rounds. Old\
  \ men smoke out of tobacco bongs in front of the bathroom. Mother\u2019s shout through\
  \ the cabin: Em \u01A1i! No one sleeps upright - above every headrest are two bare\
  \ feet, and by morning everyone\u2019s sandals are all mixed up in the aisles. The\
  \ smell of tiger balm and salty snacks ride the air, and the hum of rusty fans and\
  \ faint Bollywood music lull the older folk into an impressively peaceful sleep.\
  \ \n\nI bought a soft-berth ticket instead of a sleeper cabin, to save some money,\
  \ and to avoid staying up all night drinking with another group of teen Belgians.\
  \ I ended up sitting right in the middle of a wedding party. The bride was Vietnamese-American\
  \ who married a man from Hanoi. They were on their honeymoon, and of course, the\
  \ whole family went with them. A friendly co sitting behind me tapped me on the\
  \ shoulder with one hand and handed me a banh mi with the other, stuffed full with\
  \ triangles of brie and white pepper sausage. \"Go on,\" the bride said. I thanked\
  \ them and ate it slowly. Every so often, she would reach over and stuff more sausage\
  \ between the loaves. \n\nIt is uncustomary - and in some cases, impolite - to thank\
  \ others in Vietnamese, but I find this difficult to remember as a stranger amongst\
  \ kind, generous people. A free broken shoe repair; volunteer translations at the\
  \ pharmacy; gifts of mango candy; invitations for tea and conversation; countless\
  \ good samaritans who\u2019ve provided roadside assistance for a hapless foreigner\
  \ like myself and her aging Honda Win. Despite all the corruption and that plagues\
  \ Vietnam, a heartfelt cam on slips off my tongue at least a dozen times a day,\
  \ sometimes one after the other, again and again. In places like Hanoi, even saying\
  \ \u201CHello\u201D is not done, often replaced with an unnatural-feeling, \u201C\
  Hey you.\u201D After the many months I've spent traveling here, there isn\u2019\
  t a day that goes by where I don\u2019t take in all the beautiful, brilliant chaos\
  \ around me and greet it with one giant grin that seems to say: \u201CHello, hey\
  \ you, thank you very much!\u201D"
