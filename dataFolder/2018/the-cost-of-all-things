Text: "Lightning illuminated the expansive ocean in brilliant flashes of blinding\
  \ white, while the tide continued to rise, effortlessly pulling the sand out from\
  \ under our cold, wet feet. The thunder had become so loud we'd given up on talking\
  \ altogether, as we trudged along the empty shoreline. Robert and I, a tad apprehensive,\
  \ were relying solely on James' headlamp and muscle memory to take us to the spot\
  \ where he had seen the turtle earlier that day. I could taste the sea salt on my\
  \ lips, while my sweating, aching body continued on our moonlit path in the humid\
  \ Nicaraguan night. \n\nIt didn't take long for us to reach the place. Even in the\
  \ dark the leatherback was instantly recognizable amidst the flurry of crabs and\
  \ other scavengers surrounding the poor deceased creature. Within moments of our\
  \ arrival, the tide rose with a deep, haunting groan, and swallowed the desecrated\
  \ turtle back into her watery depths. Disturbed by the evidence that poachers had\
  \ beaten us there, we turned in shocked silence, and walked back the way we had\
  \ come, heads buried deep in our own dark thoughts. \n\nThat was when we saw her.\n\
  \nWhile James and I were gazing at the endless inky sky above us, musing over timing\
  \ and purpose, Robert called our names, shattering the silence with tangible excitement.\
  \ Another leatherback had emerged from the frothing sea, retracing her steps up\
  \ the same sandy shore she'd been born on 25 years prior, to continue her legacy.\
  \ We watched in awestruck silence as she danced in purposeful circles, creating\
  \ intricate mandalas in the earth, before she safely laid each egg. The ordeal lasted\
  \ twenty long, hushed minutes. With heaving breaths, she slowly, and silently, returned\
  \ into the arms of the ocean.\n\nWe moved swiftly, and dutifully covered the beautiful\
  \ swirling pattern and eggs she had left behind, in a last ditch attempt to right\
  \ the wrongs of many years of poaching. We made our peace with Mother Nature, and\
  \ carried on. Leaving only footprints, we started back towards our hostel, unabashedly\
  \ wiping tears from our cheeks and worrying none about the sandfly bites freckling\
  \ our exposed arms and legs. \n\nThe lightning had slowed, the thunder no longer\
  \ shook the sand from beneath us, but instead enveloped us in a warm, dark blanket\
  \ of peace. The salt on my lips tasted of freedom, and the low hum of the ocean\
  \ soothed my tired mind. As I looked up towards that vast inky sky, stretching into\
  \ the receding sea, I knew I was right where I should be."
