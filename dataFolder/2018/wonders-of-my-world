Text: "Growing up in a country that celebrates diversity, sparked a desire to learn\
  \ more about different cultures and different languages.  Languages aren\u2019t\
  \ taught in a vacuum, they include lessons in history, cuisine and even etiquette.\
  \ \nMy interest in learning different languages, led to me trying out different\
  \ foods, When I was in Durban, I frequently visited the Victoria street market,\
  \ a space that\u2019s rich in culture and heritage. I wanted see everything and\
  \ I knew visiting once was not going to suffice. The market housed different stalls\
  \ with spices, Indian cultural regalia, cuisine and the like. I found myself trying\
  \ out different foods, all because I showed interest in how they made the food.\
  \ Nishani, offered different platters of food for free, because of the connection\
  \ we made through having a conversation about Indian cuisine she was kind enough\
  \ to let me try different dishes.    \nWhen I was in Limpopo, I made sure I knew\
  \ how to order certain food staples and ask basic directions. Vhagani, our tour\
  \ guide was so intrigued he started asking questions in Sepedi, Our conversation\
  \ about the differences in the Bantu languages, lead to him inviting my friends\
  \ and I to the Fundudzi lake in Venda, we learnt traditional dancing and singing\
  \ and a bit of history. We also got to learn more about the culture from the elders\
  \ of the village. \nThis particular trip to Soweto left me with a new and different\
  \ view of Johannesburg. The hidden beautiful pockets of Soweto, the sameness yet\
  \ different elements of language in different townships. Ratang, had unearthed something\
  \ that I would appreciate for the rest of my life. I stopped being a tourist to\
  \ him the moment we bonded over language I had become \"abuti\", brother, this led\
  \ him to allow me to peep at a world usually hidden. Hidden by the sky-scrappers\
  \ in the city center. Masked by the shiny Sandton City. I realized that some of\
  \ the very best and authentic experiences are not planned, and you can easily miss\
  \ the magic if you are not open minded .  This also made me realize the importance\
  \ of local connections. I learnt so much about a township I thought I knew. I had\
  \ rejected the single story, of townships being dangerous. I instead found paradise."
