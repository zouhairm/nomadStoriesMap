Text: "It was drizzling persistently and annoyingly in Tokyo through the evening,\
  \ so I didn\u2019t know whether meeting up with Hirohito during rush hour at the\
  \ world\u2019s busiest railway station in Shinjuku was a dry haven or maddening\
  \ idea, given that I had never met Hirohito before. Tokyo instantly came across\
  \ as punctual, systematic, and obliging. And Hirohito was no different. There was\
  \ no time to waste in this rushed city. And if a good time was to be had, then even\
  \ more so. I told him I desperately wanted to visit Piss Alley. He smirked & scoffed\
  \ as politely as he could. He had better designs for the night and I couldn\u2019\
  t mess with Japanese precision, even though I tried.\n\nIn Tokyo the sun sets quickly\
  \ and the lights go up even quicker. As we walked through Shinjuku's crowd and rain,\
  \ my 7-11 bought umbrellas jostling for space, it was tough not to stop and marvel\
  \ at those towering neon signs reflecting on the shiny black streets. Everything\
  \ was futuristic and electric. Soon navigating both conversation & crowd, Hirohito\
  \ was lost in its maze. We took the scenic route down Omoide Yokocho, literally\
  \ \u2018memory lane\u2019, aka Piss Alley. Goddess Uzume was listening.\n\nPiss\
  \ Alley sounds smellier than it is. In fact, the smells are delicious. Narrower\
  \ than a needle, it is packed with tiny bars with noisy tourists, whiffs of charcoal,\
  \ and sizzles of grilled meats. Reams have been written about this little stretch\
  \ of Tokyo, and as a curious traveler, I wanted to sample its food as much as its\
  \ infectious energy. How can you walk through Piss Alley and not get piss drunk?\
  \ As a local, Hirohito frowned upon Piss Alley and the tourist hotspot that it was.\
  \ I threw him a silent challenge: could Hirohito\u2019s local knowledge top Piss\
  \ Alley, or would it just be horse-meat?\n\nWe headed straight to an underground\
  \ izakaya in Tokyo\u2019s kinky red-light district, Kabukicho. And if I thought\
  \ Piss Alley was cramped, this obscure watering hole, nestled between a massage\
  \ parlour and a love hotel, was a puddle. A wooden bar ran along its length, along\
  \ which were stools, along which was the wall. Large menus, neatly calligraphed,\
  \ hung on walls. I was the only tourist. Hirohito gave swift instructions to the\
  \ chefs, and soon a plate of delicately sliced plum pink meat was placed in front\
  \ of us, with bits of ginger and bobs of onion. I took a chopstick full. Yum. I\
  \ turned to the chef, mouth still full, happy. He said, \u2018Basashi\u2019. Hirohito\
  \ leaned in to translate: raw horse meat. And so we got piss drunk. Kanpai!"
