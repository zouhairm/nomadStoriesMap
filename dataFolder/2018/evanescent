Text: "By early afternoon, Tsomgo had frozen over. A glacial wind howled over the\
  \ immaculate white expanse of the lake. Yaks tucked their massive heads close to\
  \ their festive chests and stood very, very still. I caught one perfect snowflake\
  \ in my red glove. And then I ran into the nearest chai shop where warmth and companionship\
  \ beckoned. \n\n*\n\nWe were returning from Nathu La, a border trading post at the\
  \ mountain pass in Sikkim between India and Tibet, part of the Old Silk Route. The\
  \ Chinese guards on the other side of the barbed wire had tried to look sharp as\
  \ windchill shaved a few more degrees off minus 11. One of them had flicked two\
  \ fingers in the universal gesture: Got a smoke? There\u2019s a code among fierce\
  \ invalids not yet home from cold climates. Traded two for relief that crinkled\
  \ his eyes. \n\n*\n\nThe shop was just one of those that you find anywhere along\
  \ the mountain roads. Held up half by precarious contraption and half by reckless\
  \ optimism, they have this central feature: a long table in the middle of which\
  \ is set a thick iron cylinder with a conical top, upon which sits a tall flute\
  \ that serves as a chimney for the fire within. They serve tea, coffee, Maggi instant\
  \ noodles, and biscuits that turn into food only at high altitudes. They also slap\
  \ you away if \u2013 in your brainfreeze \u2013 you try to roast your appendages.\
  \ (This latter service is free.) Winter in Sikkim. If you look at a map of India,\
  \ you will see this old mountain kingdom nestled snugly in the middle of Nepal,\
  \ Bhutan, and Tibet.\n\n*\n\nI took my place at this table. My teeth started to\
  \ chatter. I looked at the little girl sitting across from me. She could not have\
  \ been more than three. Unruly wisps of brown hair clung about her tiny face. Without\
  \ a word, she took off her single mitten and laid it on the cracked table. Grimy\
  \ with dirt, the mitten must have been pink once. I could have held it in my palm\
  \ with room to spare. I held my smile. She climbed onto her knees on the bench.\
  \ Reaching across, she took my hands between hers and rubbed them earnestly. Ah,\
  \ what.  \n\nI turned my head for a second. She was gone. No girl, no mitten. \n\
  \n* \n\n\u201CHave you seen a little girl, yay big?\u201D \n\u201CWhat girl?\u201D\
  \ \n\u201CShe was just here. Very young.\u201D \n\u201CNo, it\u2019s just you.\u201D\
  \ \n\n*\n\nIn a photo taken just after, my eyes glitter like gems."
