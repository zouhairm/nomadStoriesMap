Text: "Millions of people each year pack their bags, put on their flip flops and travel\
  \ to Spain. \n\nOver 3 million tourists alone come to the province of Alicante or\
  \ Alacant. Knowing the presence of culture, great food and impressive historical\
  \ architecture. \n\nSanta Barbara castle alongside Tabarca and the Canelobre Caves;\
  \ take most of the spotlight during visits to Alacant. \n\nWith that, we take an\
  \ understanding why these historical sites and sandy beaches attract visitors but,\
  \ why not immerse, in the salty rural truth of Alacant?\n\nTravellers miss the opportunity\
  \ to visit the Salt Lakes. Bypassing the chance while driving on the Spanish highways,\
  \ unaware of the beauty and the connections of the Nature Park. \n\nMy ethos; if\
  \ your a globetrotter then you must see everything.'italics'\n\nSalt Lakes, one\
  \ of the most obscure landmarks on the travelling to-do-list made me visit the areas\
  \ in which, Gran Alacant produces enormous amounts of Salt. \nTo explain, mesmerising.\n\
  \nTourists, whom have researched this particular are aware of the flora, fauna and\
  \ flamingo's. On the other hand, Instagrammees, Facebookers and all walks of life\
  \ whom visit should swipe the chance.\n\nWithin the Nature Parks and Salt Lakes\
  \ lay over 40 species of Sharks on the Mediterranean coast line.  \n\nThe Nautical\
  \ club of Santa Pola contradicts the dryness of the Nature Reserve Parks and particularly\
  \ highlighting the contradiction to these beautiful underwater creatures.\n\nHiring\
  \ a boat within Spanish culture is common and acquiring a boat license under 6 metres\
  \ - a walk in the park. 'italics'\n\nIn order to completely submerge myself in nauticals\
  \ and sharks - setting sail with the fear of such a species wasn't easy, knowing\
  \ that further into the deep blue sea an experience of a lifetime awaits.\n\nAlicante\
  \ where the normal is perfectly fine but within the obscure you find perfection."
