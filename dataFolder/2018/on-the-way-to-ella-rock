Text: "It's impossible to reproduce the beauty I see and feel through a photograph,\
  \ less through words. It's been 35 hours since I've decided to observe the idyllic\
  \ view from Ella Rock, the highest point around my location. Around 5 am I left\
  \ the hotel with a torch at hand with the hope that the break of light would be\
  \ more generous on my attempt to reproduce such paradise. I went with a map which\
  \ was given to me by the hotel owner, it explained quite well how to get to the\
  \ train line which I would have to follow but without the slightest idea when would\
  \ be the right moment to abandon it. I find a local man who tells me, \" After the\
  \ three Buddhas turn left..\". It seemed quite simple. A few minutes later I see\
  \ a small Buddha statue, looked for the other two and thought they might have been\
  \ taken down for some reason, I see a small shortcut straight after it and thought\
  \ it had to be the right one. \n\nWent down through trees, monkey and bird sounds\
  \ and other animals with whom I probably appreciated the distance. With a strong\
  \ sensation of being on the wrong track I kept going, my other alternative would\
  \ be to walk back at least an hour, losing the sunrise and the reason that made\
  \ me walk up at this time of the day. The adventure was reason enough to laugh to\
  \ myself along the way, even if I didn't make it to my destination. I finally face\
  \ the end of the trail and can only see huge ladder shaped crops of about 1m each,\
  \ all of them drenched up due to the purportedly constant flow of water which irrigated\
  \ parts of the plantation. With the impression that after this hard task I would\
  \ be able to find a new trail to the peak I kept going, all muddied up I find out\
  \ that after about 10 of these steps of mud and water I had a new valley without\
  \ an apparent way through, I see the sun starting to come up and give up.\n\nI went\
  \ down through the same crops, by this time I couldn't care less with my clothes.\
  \ As I start the return journey I see a man at a distance right across the crops,\
  \ thought he could still get mad at me for walking through his plantation but as\
  \ I came closer I was only received with a smile, a strong look of admiration and\
  \ an invitation for tea. Me and Mr. Ariyapala laughed a lot of my adventures and\
  \ while trying to communicate the best way possible I invited him to be my guide\
  \ for the next morning. After asking his wife if possible since somebody had to\
  \ take the children to school he confirmed he would take me, we said goodbye and\
  \ I went back to my hotel. \n..."
