Text: "\u201CYou have to see Butterfly Beach, ill meet you in Palolem after work and\
  \ get us a cheap boat and we can camp out on the beach\u201D proclaimed my friend\
  \ Astra excitedly. She had a few more days work in the north of Goa leaving me to\
  \ marvel curiously as to what this mystical beach had to offer. I rode south with\
  \ the intention of seeing her in a few days. Goa has a unique ambience to it unlike\
  \ anywhere else I have visited, every route on my rusty yet duly reliable Enfield\
  \ motorbike offered a new adventure without exception. After a few days exploring\
  \ Palolem, Astra rang me to explain her work was too hectic to come see me. Left\
  \ \u2018Hans Solo\u2019 with a puffy cheeked face which wouldn\u2019t look out of\
  \ place covered in fromage frais in a Petis Filous advert  I was a walking target\
  \ for locals without Astra. Butterfly beach was only accessible by boat and I was\
  \ getting quoted extortionate amounts simply impossible for my shoe string budget.\
  \ Commence plan B, after printing off a map of the area, a few miles of \u2018Leopard\
  \ Valley\u2019 and a few miles of dense jungle should of spelled the end of the\
  \ road but armed with a dozen large samosas and 8 litres of water a mile into leopard\
  \ valley I found my self loathing my prior enthusiasm of defiance. As I approached\
  \ the jungle my black rucksack straps were turning white. I was loosing salts fast.\
  \ I felt delirious and was barely able to make an accurate navigation check on the\
  \ map. My na\xEFve determination had transcended to a fight for survival. Down to\
  \ the last emergency 3 litres of water for the return leg I could finally hear the\
  \ coast. I peeled back the branches to reveal paradise. Running out into the sand\
  \ I collapsed in exhaustion. I was not alone. A small group of tourists who were\
  \ having a blissfully care free day snorkelling having just been dropped off by\
  \ their private boat driver with beers and a luxurious buffet stared at me in bewilderment\
  \ as I emerged from the jungle. \u201CIs this Butterfly beach?\u201D I cried out,\
  \ \u201Cyes\u201D they all laughed. They dragged me into the shade and placed an\
  \ ice cold beer into my hands as I could survey my majestic surroundings. Diving\
  \ into the crystal clear bay of the water immediately losing my sweaty salty shroud\
  \ with one refreshing plunge, I resurfaced simply to confirm that I was alive and\
  \ I had arrived in heaven."
