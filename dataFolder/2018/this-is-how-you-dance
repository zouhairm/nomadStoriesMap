Text: "Even though I was not lucky in terms of weather conditions, if unlucky means\
  \ \u201Csuffering\u201D 15\xBA degrees Celsius when in Cuba, because temperature\
  \ rarely drops below 25\xBA all year long, but, as a local told me replying my complains,\
  \ unlucky are the victims of the tsunami in Haiti, and let me speechless. \nI was\
  \ lucky enough to be in the Pearl of the Caribbean for a few days and willing to\
  \ get the best out of it.  The cays, the nature and the contrasts explode in Cuba\
  \ like the bubbles in a glass of champagne to dance to the rhythm of the sun, the\
  \ salsa and its people. the amazing beaches of turquoise waters and golden sands\
  \ frame the seductive vestiges of the aboriginal culture. With a flow of history,\
  \ tradition and charm that gushes forth. Especially Old Havana, with the come-down\
  \ buildings from the colonial era, due to the lack of maintenance over the years,\
  \ but still beautiful and majestic, not for nothing today it is world heritage by\
  \ UNESCO.\nMuch more than visiting the famous Bodeguita de en Medio, I loved the\
  \ idea of going to a dance club, expecting nothing but getting a flavor of the atmosphere,\
  \ drinking a cool mojito and above all willing to have fun that night.  There were\
  \ groups of friends, some couples, the girls better dressed than the boys, but all\
  \ of them really stylish. \nRound dance floor, with tables all around, salsa music\
  \ was playing, and I admired how those people moved to the rhythm, without a doubt\
  \ they have a gift. Regular people are not able to move their hips that way.  The\
  \ rules in term of dancing salsa are that men invite women to dance; his role is\
  \ to lead the steps and hers is to follow him. It may sound a bit sexist but it\
  \ is a tradition from the old days.\nI remember that Victor took my hand and dragged\
  \ me to the dance floor. I guess I followed his steps as the salsa rule says, but\
  \ the thing is that I was dancing salsa with a dark skinned, white coffee as I call\
  \ it, Cuban guy. He was wearing a white shirt, white pants and a glorious white\
  \ smile. We did not talk, we just danced for the duration of a single song (that\
  \ is another rule of the salsa, just one song with each partner), there were only\
  \ those 3-4 minutes but the flavor lasted a life time.\nIt's ambitious to say that\
  \ you get to know a city when you spend only a few days travelling around, but sometimes\
  \ just a single experience brings you much further and when it comes to dancing,\
  \ Cuba has no rival.  In Old Havana everything tastes better anyway."
