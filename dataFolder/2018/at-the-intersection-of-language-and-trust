Text: "We hung on the side of a rowboat at that magic time of day when the sky glows\
  \ in pale rainbow hues, before the sun rises and smears the colors away with bright\
  \ light. Our wallets, passports, and phones were sitting in the boat with the man\
  \ we\u2019d met yesterday. He urged us in Spanish, \u2018It\u2019s okay - let go.\u201D\
  \ Part of me wondered - if we let go, will he row away and leave us?\n\nWe had spent\
  \ a month in Guatemala studying Spanish and had taken the last two weeks to venture\
  \ out on our own to different corners, trusting our guts to interpret the language,\
  \ and instincts to trust strangers.\n\nWe looked at each other across the small\
  \ dingy and let go. Our gu\xEDa didn\u2019t row away as we squinted across the water.\
  \ It seemed we were too close a gap from the lumps bobbing on the surface across\
  \ from us, and we tread water as long as we dared. We were swimming in Monterrico,\
  \ on the edge where saltwater and freshwater meet, a small current acting like a\
  \ fence, separating us from the sharp teeth and bobbing eyes that lay beyond.\n\
  I don\u2019t know whether we swam for a minute, or 10, but it felt both an eternity,\
  \ and a narrow escape. When we finally climbed back in the boat, wrapping towels\
  \ around our shoulders and shivering with adrenaline, we looked out at all the crocodiles\
  \ from the safety of the narrow bench, water dripping onto my phone. I glanced at\
  \ our guide, his paddles slipping calmly into the water, at opposites with my still\
  \ pounding heart. We disappeared back into the forest that floated up out of the\
  \ water, the mangrove trees reaching on tiptoes, their roots trying to escape the\
  \ tides where they grew. We didn\u2019t have a waterway, and the boat just moved\
  \ back through the woods that enfolded around us.\n\nThere are places in our lives\
  \ where we never expect to end up and people we never expect to trust. Where these\
  \ two intersect, we grow through experience.\n\nOn the way back, we stopped at the\
  \ monster tree we had climbed earlier by moonlight when our guide had encouraged\
  \ us. We\u2019d clambered out of the boat, half asleep, reaching up and pulling\
  \ ourselves into it until we were high above the moon\u2019s reflection in the dark\
  \ water below. Our guide was going on about something until my friend screamed.\
  \ We\u2019d rushed back into the boat, brushing the countless footprints of ants\
  \ off our skin, our squeals and laughs echoing off the forest walls floating around\
  \ us. Had he mentioned ants? Our gu\xEDa laughed loudly and pointed ahead to where\
  \ the crocodiles lie with our trust in his hands."
