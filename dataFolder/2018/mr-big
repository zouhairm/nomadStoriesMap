Text: "He greeted me with a mysterious smile and a stretched out helmet. \"Ready?\"\
  \ he asked. I reached for the helmet and answered with \"Let's go!\"\nFrom the motorbike\
  \ I noticed a sign reading PETULU VILLAGE. The night before I had watched in awe\
  \ as hundreds of white heron flew over from my balcony. \"Heading for Petulu\",\
  \ Mr. Big explained. For the last 50 years, thousands of heron have flown here to\
  \ nest every night.The birds have become sacred to the villagers; a sign of good\
  \ luck and prosperity.Among the fig trees stood a shaky platform about two stories\
  \ high. Nothing except miles and miles of lush rice fields lay ahead. Flying in\
  \ from every direction it became impossible to count the heron as they descended\
  \ down on the village by the hundreds.Their backdrop was a sky on fire with the\
  \ brightest orange and yellow sun beginning to set.\u201CWhat an amazing place to\
  \ see the sunset too\u201DI gleamed. To my surprise he looked back at me and then\
  \ looked up to the sky. \"Come on, there's somewhere else I want to to take you\
  \ tonight.\u201DThe last couple of days spent in Ubud flashed through my mind. Starting\
  \ with the morning I first walked through the front gate and into his home. All\
  \ I could hear was running water as it poured into ponds filled with coy fish, and\
  \ exotic birds of every color chirping in tall banyan trees.\_A strange voice was\
  \ chanting my name and then a man appeared before me.\u201CWelcome home Laura. You\
  \ can call me Mr. Big\u201D.The next morning he appeared at the top of my stairs.\
  \ Barely dressed with only shorts hanging from his hips. He was there long enough\
  \ only to say \u201CI am busy today but I want to take you to a special place later.\u201D\
  \_I spent the day leisurely reading a book while he spent the morning caring for\
  \ his sick father-in law and the afternoon helping a neighbor build on to his home.\
  \ Still, he had rushed back to take me to see the Herons and wanted to take me one\
  \ more place before the day was done.\nThe most spectacular rice paddy field stretched\
  \ out in front of us looking like a painting reflecting off the sky, now a perfect\
  \ combination of purple and blue.The shallow water sparkled like millions of diamond\
  \ below the surface.\nWe watched as the blues and purples faded to black and the\
  \ last bit of light vanished from the sky.\u3000Mr. Big\u3000was my own sacred Bali\
  \ Heron, flying away on his motorbike every day and returning home at night to nest\
  \ with his family."
