Text: "I was born and brought up in a middle-class family in a small town of India.\
  \ Well educated parents and with 3 siblings, I suppose I had a decent childhood.\
  \ My mother made every effort to give us good education so we could all find a career\
  \ and have a secured life. However, in the process what I missed out on was the\
  \ quality family time. E.g. we never had a family trip. After many years when I\
  \ started working, I felt left out when I heard my friends and colleagues talk about\
  \ their family vacations. I dated someone for quite some time who loved travelling\
  \ but then we broke up, one of the reasons being, my inability to organise a holiday.\
  \ I was heartbroken and started going into depression. But I knew I had to pull\
  \ myself together, so I did, after 4 years (yeah that\u2019s right, it took me 4\
  \ long yrs.). By the time I had started to earn a decent income and had saved a\
  \ bit as well. I thought for quite some time about what could make me happy, and\
  \ I kept going back to one thing \u2018a motorbike\u2019 that I had been dreaming\
  \ of for a while. So I decided and bought that bike and my life started to take\
  \ a turn from there. I started going on small rides on the weekends with friends\
  \ and colleagues. I became a known name in the company as I was and I\u2019m still,\
  \ the only female motorbike rider in the entire office. The travelling started to\
  \ create its place in my heart, I enjoyed being out on the roads and exploring,\
  \ I got better and better in planning and in no time, I became a vivid rider. It\
  \ felt like it was all worth it when I rode in the Himalayas in August 2017 and\
  \ reached 18,380 ft. altitude in Ladhak, Khardongla. When that was done and I was\
  \ back in Delhi, I had the urge to do more, so I decided to ride solo from Delhi\
  \ to Bangalore, travelling in Rajasthan on the way. Many thought I was being foolish,\
  \ but I knew I could do it. So, I started, believing in myself, and when I reached\
  \ Bangalore after being on the roadtrip for 32 days and 6300 kms, I couldn\u2019\
  t be anymore happier. It was in that moment I realised anything was possible, only\
  \ if I was determined. So here I am now saving and planning again for more solo\
  \ rides, to get out there to explore the world and tell the tales my travel to the\
  \ world. \nI\u2019m a passionate rider now, and I have now covered most of South\
  \ India and I plan on riding in rest of the country. And soon go out of county for\
  \ international riding. I now live with the motto \u2013 \u2018Don\u2019t Fear Dying,\
  \ Fear Not Living \u2013 Let\u2019s Ride\u2019."
