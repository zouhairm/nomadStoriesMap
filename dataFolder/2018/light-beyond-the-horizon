Text: "I had just finished a bowl of the best \u201CMaggi noodles\u201D I had, had\
  \ in ages. The lady and her son couldn\u2019t have been better hosts. Before I bid\
  \ adieu, I asked if I could take her picture. I had to capture those elusive green\
  \ eyes - the beauty and the sadness that was evident. As I made my way out she asked\
  \ if I would mail the pictures, I nodded my head without much ado; I knew that the\
  \ odds of the pictures arriving at an isolated tavern set in the foothills of the\
  \ Himalayas were remote. \nIt read 2 o\u2019clock on my watch, the detour to see\
  \ the geysers at Panamik had not helped and it was getting colder and darker. I\
  \ had finally reached Khardhungla, the ride back was not easy by any means, the\
  \ temperature had dropped to below 0 Degree Celsius and I could hardly feel my fingers\
  \ or toes. What awaited me on the other side of the world\u2019s highest motor-able\
  \ pass was a freak blizzard. In less than 10 minutes the entire mountain range was\
  \ covered in snow. Driving was next to impossible with zero visibility accompanied\
  \ by the slippery terrain. I was literally skating downhill with a 500 pound motorbike.\
  \ \nEvery time I hit the brakes, the bike spun out of control and I caressed the\
  \ shiny white roads.  My body took the brunt with each fall. To help my visibility\
  \ I broke the visor on my helmet which kept fogging. On the downside my face would\
  \ now be a victim of the unrelenting cold as well. The roads kept getting worse\
  \ with the glassy path turning into mush; and then I fell again for the fifth time.\
  \ \nI was thrown off the bike and tumbled close to the edge of the peak. The bike\
  \ twirled, did a full circle before landing on my ankle. I managed to wiggle my\
  \ leg from under the bike, but I had no energy to lift the bike nor could I stand\
  \ up. I recollected seeing army convoys passing me the day before on my way to the\
  \ top, but all I could see now was the grey empty roads that went on for miles.\
  \ My elbows were bleeding, my fingers were slowly starting to turn blue and my face\
  \ was beginning to get numb. Far away beyond the horizon I could see the sun fighting\
  \ a despairing battle against the clouds.  I reached for my backpack to get the\
  \ camera for one last click, and it was beautiful. \nI wanted to close my eyes and\
  \ rest, go back to the memories of my mom that flickered in my thoughts. And finally\
  \ I cried; I let it all out; it had been over a year since she had passed but I\
  \ had not shed a tear. Away in the distance I could hear the muffled noise of a\
  \ jeep."
