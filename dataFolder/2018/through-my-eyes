Text: They say when you fall in love it doesn't have to be a person or an animal.A
  beautiful country can easily make a person fall in love with it's cities,the people
  who invite you and are proud to,show you another world they live in,create in,work
  in,raise families in and share friendships they make from neighbors and some who
  travel and become a life-long friends who are no longer a stranger anymore.They
  say "Honesty is the best policy" with me it's the one out of many things i believe
  in to keep within myself.I have never been out of the "States" before.I have traveled,but
  to cities that were family & friend-related.When i was around 16 i saw a movie that
  was filmed in the beautiful country of "Greece" and that's where i fell in love
  for the first time.Not a person but a country that seemed inviting,beautiful scenery
  any writer, like me,an "amateur,"would find so many passions and indescribable scenes
  that only "eyes" could see it all.I agree with "seeing is believing" so i let my
  eyes do just that.Telling or trying to explain something "indescribable" is not
  the same as seeing it.Just my opinion.History is a big passion for me and i know
  there's a lot there to explore,write about and discover.I write poetry and the words
  i write down come from my heart.You only use a pen and paper to write the words
  and put on paper.Seeing a different world,sort-of-speaking,would be the ideal place
  for any kind of writer to use their "eyes" to see the beauty and have the descriptions
  come from what they feel and put to in their heart. I live in a small town,in the
  country and see wildlife all the time,Deer,skunks,raccoons,etc...and the best part
  of it is the nature that provides beauty and life to the wildlife,plants,flowers,is
  so real and touchable.There's even "Black bears" that live in the mountains and
  i have seen one up close,kept my distance,but it was big,yet showed no aggression.Wanted
  berries and whatnot around the farms and it was yelled at and went back up to it's
  home.No shooting it involved.To see something like a bear in it's natural habitat
  you respect it's beauty & you respect and appreciate what your seeing and memories
  can never be taken away.I keep all my memories in my heart and then sometimes i
  share my heart with others,showing them what i'v seen,"through my eyes" and hope
  they share the same feelings & passions i do and appreciate what they have just
  seen and felt & maybe one day they can see what they want,"through their eyes".
