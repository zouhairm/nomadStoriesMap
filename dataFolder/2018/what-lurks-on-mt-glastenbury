Text: "Summer was turning to fall on the Appalachian Trail and I decided to spend\
  \ two weeks hiking north into Vermont. It was my sixth day on the trail when I made\
  \ my way into the mysterious area known as the Bennington Triangle. An area that\
  \ earned its nickname after disappearances and strange occurrences spanning back\
  \ to when it was a logging community in the 1700s. The town of Glastenbury, located\
  \ at the base of Mt. Glastenbury, became a popular tourist destination in 1897 for\
  \ one year before failing and becoming an abandoned ghost town. The problem in Glastenbury\
  \ was due to over-logging which made the area prone to landslides that eventually\
  \ wiped out the railroad in 1898.\n\nIt was drizzly and raw the day I hiked over\
  \ Mt. Glastenbury, the woods were quiet and still, it was perfectly eerie. I came\
  \ down the mountain to find a small shelter in a clearing with a view of the valley\
  \ below. No one was there. I was settling into the shelter when I came across some\
  \ papers stuffed in a wooden box under the bed. \u201CThe Mystery of Mt. Glastenbury\u201D\
  \ was the title of one article. Article after article talked about how the mountain\
  \ was cursed and haunted.\n\nNot one for superstition I put it out of my mind and\
  \ went back to unpacking. I built a big fire and watched from the shelter as it\
  \ burned out and my eyes drifted shut. In the middle of the night I awoke to sounds\
  \ from outside the shelter that didn\u2019t sound like an animal or anything I had\
  \ heard before. The sounds got louder, I was getting nervous; it was 5 miles to\
  \ the next shelter in the dark, but I couldn\u2019t stay. I set my flashlight on\
  \ the table and was furiously packing my bag. All of a sudden the light went out.\
  \ I grabbed my headlamp and shined it at the light on the table. The light that\
  \ had been facing me was turned and facing the other direction. My heart was in\
  \ my throat, I picked up my bag and started running. I ran 5 miles non-stop, tripping\
  \ and getting temporarily lost off trail the entire way. I stumbled into the camp\
  \ out of breath. Two hikers were staying there who I had met another night. I told\
  \ them the story. I sounded like a mad man, but I didn\u2019t care. The next day\
  \ I went home.\n\nI can\u2019t say for sure what happened that night, maybe it was\
  \ something from the other side or maybe it was my imagination running wild; I\u2019\
  ll never know for sure. I can say that I\u2019ve never been scared enough to run\
  \ 5 miles in the middle of the night since. It was a decision that truly pushed\
  \ me beyond the edge (and possibly the grave)."
