Text: "The last thing I expected traveling through 16 countries in 16 months, was\
  \ to be robbed by a monkey. I had embarked on the adventure of a lifetime with my\
  \ husband. As photographers and film-makers, we wanted to travel and make a difference.\
  \ So we helped kids, animals, women, and the environment. As an animal lover, I\
  \ was mesmerized whenever I came across a cheeky monkey. In the Sacred Monkey Forest\
  \ in Bali, one perched on my shoulder, and peed on the shoulder of another unfortunate\
  \ traveler.\nOur 15th country was India. After teaching film-making to kids in a\
  \ Goa slum, we explored the rest of this vibrant, chaotic country. From a bamboo\
  \ boat ride on the backwaters of Kochin to traveling by trains, buses, and tuk-tuks;\
  \ we visited the Taj Mahal, and important Buddhist sites in India; where Buddha\
  \ was enlightened, gave his first teachings and took his last breaths.\nIn Rajasthan,\
  \ we visited incredible lakes, waterfalls, temples, and ancient wells: capturing\
  \ a bird's eye view with our drone. Here, at a waterfall, I got my first, and only\
  \ taste of crime on our trip. Before leaving London, concerned friends and family\
  \ had warned us \u2018Be careful!\u2019 But we soon discovered it's not all doom\
  \ and gloom as the media portrays. We trekked over rocks, followed the cascading\
  \ water, to finish our day with a dip in the glorious waters below. Basking under\
  \ the waterfall I unexpectedly got a nose-full of water. I am convinced it was Mother\
  \ Nature warning me to get out.\nAs I climbed onto the rocks, where our group had\
  \ left our bags, a monkey had her hand right in my bag and grabbed my make up bag.\
  \ I screamed -\n\u2018Give me back my make up bag!' She looked at me as if to say\
  \ the \u2018F' word, then scampered up a cliff with her comrade, attempting to unzip\
  \ my bag on the way. I was mortified. But relieved. The meddling monkey had missed\
  \ my other small bag that contained my passport and credit cards. \nIn a split second,\
  \ 100 monkey faces looked at me. I screamed again. \n\u2018HELP ME!.... MONKEYS!'\
  \ The rest of my group emerged from the water to help shoo the monkeys off before\
  \ they could steal our cameras, bags, and clothes. \nI laugh about it now. And I\
  \ imagine the monkey utilizing the contents of my make up bag. Applying my red lipstick\
  \ in my pocket mirror. Wearing my turquoise Buddha necklace. Some of the makeup\
  \ was not animal-cruelty-free. So maybe payback to us cruel humans. But I do chuckle\
  \ when I wonder what use the monkey made of my diarrhea tablets. And tampons."
