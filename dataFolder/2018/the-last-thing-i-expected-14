Text: "when my friends came to visit me in hippy Granada was to find myself languishing\
  \ in a Spanish jail. But here I was, watching a puddle of wee creep under the door\
  \ of the cell. This really was a new low. They had arrived a couple of days before,\
  \ and just hours ago we'd been having a great time, going to an art gallery/music\
  \ venue and feeling impelled to join in the jam, followed by dancing at Entre-Suelo.\
  \ I'd been living in Granada for a few months, exploring the surrounding mountains\
  \ and gazing at sunsets over the Alhambra I partied at raves at Santa Fe, a desert\
  \ area with natural hot springs. It would have been beautiful were it not for the\
  \ crusty hippies blasting out techno. All in all, life was good. My Spanish was\
  \ improving with the weather and by April my tan hid my normally unhealthy-looking\
  \ pallor. The winding streets of Granada, with its Ancient architecture and funky\
  \ bars was starting to feel like home. When some friends said they were visiting,\
  \ I was excited. My ex, Rob, was coming as well...My attempt at romance had failed,\
  \ the guy I\u2019d had a brief fling with had decided to leave \u201Cto live in\
  \ a cave\u201D. Bloody hippies. We\u2019d explore the gorgeous gorges (!) of Monachique,\
  \ we would get lost in the windy streets,  and get a lot of tapas. Granada is one\
  \ of the only places where you get free tapas with every drink (something I had\
  \ taken full advantage of over the months). Stumbling out of the club at around\
  \ 3am, we decided to call it a night. Re-grouping with some other friends outside\
  \ in the plaza, we witnessed some police violently attacking a man in his 30\u2019\
  s for no apparent reason. The plaza was full of people and many advanced towards\
  \ them to see what was going on. Getting out my phone to text my friend, suddenly\
  \ another officer stole my phone. I tried to grab it back and was pushed away, after\
  \ which my ex stepped in. The next thing I know is that Rob is being handcuffed\
  \ on the floor and I\u2019m handcuffed to him. Shouting ensued. Rob and I were dragged\
  \ into a waiting police car and, still handcuffed together, shared a passionate\
  \ kiss. It was rather romantic. Hours later, all four of us were shoved into cells,\
  \ for an unknown crime. \u201CI expected this sort of thing to happen\u201D muttered\
  \ my friend Dylan as we peered at each other through the cell bars. \u201CI never\
  \ go on holiday, and this is why.\u201D I nodded. It was the morning and I really\
  \ needed to pee (we went on the floor eventually).  They let us out after a couple\
  \ of nights, so we didn\u2019t languish for too long..."
