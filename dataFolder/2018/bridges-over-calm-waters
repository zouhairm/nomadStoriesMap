Text: "I opened my eyes as the first rays of sunlight filtered through the open window:\
  \ we were floating in space. As I watched the blue expanse in front of me, a distant\
  \ fringe of palms glided across, separating blue sky from  sleeping water. \n\n\
  I was on a houseboat on one of the many lagoons of a town called Alappuzha, in the\
  \ southern Indian state of Kerala. Alleppey (as it is affectionately called) is\
  \ heartbreakingly gorgeous: an infinite network of lagoons and rice fields. Palm\
  \ groves border the lagoons, and silent white birds skim the surface of the water.\
  \ On the waters glide two thousand houseboats in proud silence, each one constructed\
  \ along the same template - think viking ship meets Indian hut, like eccentric Venetian\
  \ gondolas. The resemblance to Venice isn\u2019t coincidental: the British called\
  \ Alleppey their \u201CVenice of the East\u201D. \n\nMy houseboat was run by two\
  \ local youths, Karim and Subhash. Karim cooked food for us in the little kitchen\
  \ at the back of the boat, while Subhash manned the wheel out in front. Karim was\
  \ in charge of \u201Chospitality.\u201D \n\nHe would cook, clean and arrange, silent\
  \ as a ghost, before vanishing into the kitchen. Although my family is Indian, I\
  \ was raised in London, so it took me a while to realise that Karim was paying lip-service\
  \ to what tradition told him was the natural hierarchy between us. It amazed and\
  \ saddened me that this grown man, at least years older than I was, considered himself\
  \ my inferior. I resolved to make friends with him. \n\nIt was like having a shy\
  \ turtle eat from your hands - the smallest mistake and in he would go into his\
  \ shell again. I would have to show him my vulnerabilities, tell him about my own\
  \ life, and highlight the similarities between me and him. \n\nLittle by little\
  \ a narrative emerged. Karim had spent his twenties in Dubai as a construction worker,\
  \ one of thousands of young men from Kerala who helped build the emirate into the\
  \ glittering jewel it is today. Like the others, he went for the foreign exchange,\
  \ saving up almost everything he earned. Once he had saved up what he thought was\
  \ enough for his kids\u2019 education, he took the first flight back home. Then\
  \ a friend tipped him about the houseboat gig, and here he was, five years later.\
  \ \n\nHe must love it here, with all this beauty? \u201CYes, it\u2019s nice,\u201D\
  \ he shrugged, clearly not as amazed as I was. \u201CI\u2019d never want my kids\
  \ to do this,\u201D he said, eyeing my shirt, \u201CI want them to go abroad, maybe\
  \ do something professional, like you.\u201D His face broke into a smile."
