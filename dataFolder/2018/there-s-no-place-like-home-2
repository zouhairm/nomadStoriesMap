Text: "\"So, Ollie, tell me a little about yourself. Where'd you grow up?\"\n\nAnswering\
  \ this question has never been a simple process for me because there is no simple\
  \ answer. So far I've moved 14 times in my life and I'm only 19. I am a Nomad in\
  \ the most textbook example of the term.\n\nWhen I was 14, my family and I moved\
  \ to Hanoi, Vietnam for 2 years. My parents were so excited about our family's next\
  \ big adventure, but I was terrified. I had only moved within Australia, and the\
  \ fear of the unknown quickly began to envelop me. \n\nThe first year, 2013, was\
  \ the loneliest and angriest time of my life. I was now the racial minority, and\
  \ experienced racism relentlessly, and none of the kids would talk to my sister\
  \ and I because we weren't rich. However, something incredibly beautiful happened\
  \ at the end of 2013, right before the new year. \n\nMy mother, sister and I travelled\
  \ up to the village where my Dad worked to spend Christmas with him. The village\
  \ is close to the Chinese boarder and is hidden in a jungle. The road to find it\
  \ is wrapped around mountains and the edges of cliffs where people have lost their\
  \ lives. The mini bus we were in was filled to capacity, and a lot of people were\
  \ starting to get sick. I was sitting in an aisle seat, but I was staring out the\
  \ front window the entire time. \n\nHalfway through the trip, faster than falling\
  \ asleep, I found myself letting all of the loneliness and anger that had been enveloping\
  \ me leave my body and exit through the floor of the bus. The wheels crushed it,\
  \ bounced it to the side of the cliffs, and drove away as it faded away. \n\nTo\
  \ this day I cannot accurately say what caused this to happen. It happened out of\
  \ nowhere, for seemingly no reason but to encourage happiness.  But I can say that\
  \ when all of the pain left my body I was still staring out that window. Out at\
  \ the landscape. Out at a beautiful, vast and incredible world before me that contained\
  \ an ocean of possibilities, and still does. Possibilities that I want to throw\
  \ myself into and turn them into opportunities. Realities. And why - why oh why\
  \ - would I stop myself from jumping into this ocean?\n\nSo, when people ask where\
  \ I grew up, there's no simple answer. I have this story to tell, because I've grown\
  \ up everywhere. Home is everywhere. It's travelling, it's a place, it's people,\
  \ and most importantly it's what I make of it. The last thing this world expected\
  \ of me was to live the life that I have lived, and the last thing I expected was\
  \ how much I would love it."
