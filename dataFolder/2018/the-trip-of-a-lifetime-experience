Text: "February 2014 was a time in life I had been waiting for, my first trip to another\
  \ African country and not just for the adventure and experiences but for a new dawn\
  \ that was about to break open for African women. The reversal of FGM. Shocking\
  \ right? Never knew there was a solution to the trauma some women in Africa had\
  \ been subjected to for decades. Hopping on a metro city bus that evening from Accra\
  \ to Ouagadougou I couldn\u2019t help but wonder how long the journey will be. \n\
  Hours later here I was. The first thing I noticed was the weather it was so dry,\
  \ sunny and dusty and to my surprise, people still dressed all covered up. Was this\
  \ about religion or culture, I wondered. Alighting from the bus voila! Everyone\
  \ was speaking French! Why did I feel uncomfortable? Of course google had told me\
  \ that French is the major language here. This is going to be tough I thought. How\
  \ come I never learnt a few sentences before coming? \n\u201CBobo Dioulasso\u201D\
  \ I said with a smile hoping the ticketing officer will get a hint of who I am,\
  \ a foreigner. \u201C12 cfa\u201D she said not returning a smile. I smiled again\
  \ nodding while reaching for some money I had changed earlier at the bolgatanga\
  \ boarder. \n5:30pm in Bobo-dioulasso and my pickup was already here waiting for\
  \ me. I gave her a tight hug with a smile. I was so happy. We rode on her motorcycle\
  \ to a house where other women were with a few men around. Even though 90% of them\
  \ couldn\u2019t understand English, We exchanged warm pleasantries and I felt at\
  \ home almost immediately while looking forward to the next day. \nAt the \u201C\
  pleasure hospital\u201D two days later for my surgery, I was so excited. Surgeries\
  \ are usually suppose to be scary but here I was waiting in happy mood. All these\
  \ years and I\u2019m finally going to feel \u201Cnormal\u201D I\u2019m finally going\
  \ to have more confidence in my sexuality. I found comfort knowing I was having\
  \ this reversal procedure done with other women from different African countries.\
  \ After the surgery came the pain. Didn\u2019t think I could cope, I had to take\
  \ drugs, dress my scars myself while going through it. Will I survive this? How\
  \ long before I walk normal again? This isn\u2019t what I thought it would be but\
  \ did I expect to have gone under the knife without feelings of discomfort? \nDays\
  \ had gone by and it was time to head back Accra. I was so emotional, I felt so\
  \ much gratitude and Love and couldn\u2019t stop thanking the non profit organization\
  \ for making me feel complete. I was finally on the edge, the edge of a closing\
  \ chapter."
