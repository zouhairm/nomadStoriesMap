Text: "- What do you mean there\u2019s no bus back to Uyuni?\n\nThe plan was a good\
  \ one, originally. Take the local bus that crosses the Salar, and ask to be dropped\
  \ on the island in the middle of it. That part had worked perfectly, we took the\
  \ \u2018papachos\u2019 bus, as Mauro liked to call it, and sat down with Bolivian\
  \ men, women, children and chicken who were going to Llica, on the other side of\
  \ the Salar. What was for visitors an out of this world scenery was for them a white\
  \ and salty plain they had to cross to go shopping. They didn\u2019t even look out\
  \ of the window, while the three of us where amazed by this gigantic white desert.\n\
  \nWe reached the Isla de Incahuasi, proud to have avoided the tourist trap that\
  \ consisted in getting there by jeep, taking a couple of pictures and going back\
  \ to town. We felt like the lucky ones, getting a chance to genuinely experience\
  \ the island\u2026 not knowing yet how right we were!\n\nWe crossed the island and\
  \ it was just us, a few wild rabbits and hundreds of giant cacti, some of them up\
  \ to four meters high. We were in winter and the surface of the Salar was dry, leaving\
  \ us without the mirroring effect that reflects the sky, but the views were still\
  \ impressive. Whiteness all around us, and silence.\n\nWhen we went back to where\
  \ the bus had dropped us we asked the man who lived there what time it would be\
  \ back. That's when we realized our plan wasn\u2019t so genius after all.\n\n- Tomorrow\
  \ I will show you how to use the mirror.\n\nHe then told us that the bus had no\
  \ reason at all to stop on the island and explained what he and his wife had to\
  \ do to be picked up. First spot the bus from afar, then use a mirror to reflect\
  \ the sun\u2019s light on the driver. This was the signal. Their link to the world,\
  \ and our hope for the next day.\n\nLuckily, we had sleeping bags with us and a\
  \ bit of food left. We headed to a cave we had seen on the other side of the island,\
  \ to get some protection from the cold, as temperatures were expected to drop under\
  \ ten degrees at night. We built a fire and got enough wood to keep it alive till\
  \ the morning. We were hungry and cold but had this feeling of knowing we were in\
  \ a very special place.\n\nThis was only confirmed by a spectacular moon rise. The\
  \ biggest moon I had ever seen rose up from the horizon, perfectly round and bright\
  \ yellow, right in front of our cave. Would we manage to get back to Uyuni on the\
  \ next day? We had forgotten all about the mirror and the bus. We were castaways\
  \ on a very peculiar island and only felt blessed for it."
