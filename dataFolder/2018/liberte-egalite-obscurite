Text: "Our path was lit by a cata lamp: a beer can with the front cut out, a candle\
  \ flame dancing on its base. This makeshift torch illuminated the narrow tunnel\
  \ walls with a warm, soft glow.\n I first read about les cataphiles in National\
  \ Geographic and learned that they had set up an illicit underground movie theater.\
  \ When police came to bust them, they vanished and left only a note: \u201CDo not\
  \ look for us.\u201D Who were these cataphiles?\n Eve put her cata lamp in a crack\
  \ within the wall. The inscribed number 1810 glowed in the stone. The first cataphiles\
  \ explored the substructure of their city centuries before us, and the appeal of\
  \ the catacombs remains today - it is a world of contrasts, a city of perpetual\
  \ night under The City of Lights. The word obscurity comes to mind here. Its French\
  \ root, obscurit\xE9, means darkness.\n  Before I had the bread and wine Eve offered\
  \ me, a clich\xE9 she insisted was truth in Paris, I washed my mud-cracked hands\
  \ in La Fontaine: a stone sink that collected water from above. The drip-drip sound\
  \ of liquid was drowned by Eve\u2019s phone blasting M.I.A.\n \u201CLive fast, die\
  \ young, bad girls do it well,\u201D echoed through the tunnel walls.\n Without\
  \ music, the ambiance of the catacombs was one of silence so powerful that I heard\
  \ blood flow past my ears. The occasional bones we stumbled on from one of the six\
  \ million buried here were constant reminders that we were in l\u2019empire de la\
  \ mort.\n My jeans were soaked after I sloshed through the waist-high waters of\
  \ a flooded passageway, and I shivered in the cool air. After hours of crouch-walking,\
  \ wedging our bodies between stone cracks, and splashing through tunnel rivers,\
  \ it was time to wade through the last stretch. \n A discarded glowstick floated\
  \ at the edge of the water. Eve extinguished her cata lamp and cut open the top\
  \ part of the stick. Then, using it as a paintbrush, she dragged the bleeding glowstick\
  \ along the cavernous walls. A galaxy of yellow-green stars shined along the rock\
  \ and reflected in the water. The ripples in the underground lake caused the mirrored\
  \ stars to twinkle.\n Even though the arrondissements sixty feet above are dense\
  \ with people, most are oblivious to the mazelike graveyard zigzagging sixty feet\
  \ below them. Still, when the obscurit\xE9 of the catacombs is interrupted by color,\
  \ like the brilliant splashes flashing all around the tunnel, the empire of death\
  \ is filled with the echoes of life."
