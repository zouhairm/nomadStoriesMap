Text: "Jacks hands me a spear. I follow him out into the patchwork of coral flats\
  \ unclothed by low tide. Jacks, named for his devotion to Michael Jackson, is an\
  \ old local of Andavadoaka, a remote Vezo fishing village on the Southwest coast\
  \ of Madagascar. His moonwalk is flawless. \nThe shallows gleam jade as I shadow\
  \ the regular gleaners; a handful of the woman of Andavadoaka. They skilfully navigate\
  \ the toothed coral flats with unsentimental footing, staining the sea with vibrant\
  \ skirts, their faces painted in ivory clay serving as sunscreen. Broad grins crack\
  \ dry mud into mosaics while eyes, sharp as their spearheads, dart about for signs\
  \ of a burrow... some broken shell or bone leading under an atoll, a disturbance\
  \ of sand. Far rarer a sight since their mothers gleaned here.\n\u201CLook boy!\u201D\
  \ \nWading waist deep through the cool maze of coral I find stillness by Jacks side.\
  \ Sand and sea settle to unveil crumbs of shell curving under coral. He rests a\
  \ rough hand on mine and gently guides the tip of my spear in delicate patterns\
  \ over the burrows doormat.\n\u201C...like a little fish.\u201D\nSurvival of the\
  \ Vezo people is entwined with the once abundant reef at their doorstep. They are\
  \ fishermen. Men with the line, women with the spear. Overpopulation has put unsustainable\
  \ demand of the reefs yield, with 50% of the village under 15 years of age. Following\
  \ an interest in marine conservation, I've volunteered to assist in action to protect\
  \ this reef. However the remoteness of the village grounds me into the reality of\
  \ a menu consisting namely of the creatures I aim to conserve. \nA lone tentacle\
  \ snakes around my spear. \n\u201CMoonwalk. Slow\u201D Jacks now stands atop the\
  \ atoll, stoic, directing. I edge backwards, drawing the creature into the quivering\
  \ light, each new tentacle seemingly autonomous; eight purple-pink tongues murmuring\
  \ the same speech in separate languages. \n\u201CSpear\u201D\nI hesitate. An outstretched\
  \ tentacle encircles my wrist. The sound of twisting bubble wrap as Jacks sheds\
  \ the suckers in a swift wiping motion. I thrust the spear forward. It connects.\
  \ Tentacles grab, stretch, curl, writhe. Thrust. It's skin pulses with rich copper\
  \ and crimson unlike anything I've seen. Mesmerising. I close my eyes and again,\
  \ thrust.\nThe octopus wilts in a hue of dead leaves. Tentacles fall limp and rock\
  \ only in rhythm with muck smudged water. I raise the ruined animal on its rod;\
  \ a crude mop. \nI question my being here. \nJacks, grown bored, is a streak of\
  \ colour twirling his spear in the distance."
