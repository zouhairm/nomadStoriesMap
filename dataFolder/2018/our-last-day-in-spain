Text: "\"Que Paso?\" (what happened) the man asked? Maryam and I quickly looked back\
  \ and took a break from fiddling with our pockets and purses. We figured he must\
  \ be asking what's the matter even though we couldn't manage to cram basic Spanish\
  \ in the last ten days. \"We lost our key. Just wondering how to get in\" I responded\
  \ without hesitation. He was a 40 something bearded Hispanic man, the kinds we'd\
  \ been googling before we stepped into the colorful territory of Spain. \"Eres el\
  \ nuevo inquilino de mateo?\" (are you Mateo's new tenants) he asked intriguingly.\
  \ \"Mateo, Yes!\" Maryam readily responded but we were still confused what the rest\
  \ of his sentence meant. He instantly opened his phone and pulled out google translation\
  \ of his question and that's when we got it right. \"No No No No No, we're not his\
  \ tenants. Mateo is our Air BnB host and we've lost the key to the house\" we both\
  \ spoke in tandem. Maryam was kind enough to type it for him in the translation\
  \ box. He was pleased. \"Mateo es un buen amigo Puedo despertarlo si insistes, pero\
  \ alternativamente, podr\xEDas ser mis invitados. Vivo al lado\" (Mateo is a good\
  \ friend. I can wake him up if you insist but alternatively, you could be my guests.\
  \ I live next door). We read the translation on his phone and felt slightly awkward\
  \ about him offering us his house in the middle of the night. While we knew that\
  \ Jerez is a conservative small town that doesn't have too many hotels that would\
  \ welcome us at that hour with no passports and visas, we still weren't willing\
  \ to risk ourselves at a stranger's house with such language barriers. He figured\
  \ that his proposition had made us uneasy, so he attempted again. He wrote \"No\
  \ te preocupes, se\xF1oras. Est\xE1n mi esposa y mis hijos en la casa. Estar\xE1\
  s a salvo\" (Don't you worry ladies. There's my wife and kids in the house. You'd\
  \ be safe) and this brought a contended smile on our faces. We felt honored when\
  \ we arrived in his house. His kids were asleep. The wife had opened the door. He\
  \ conveyed to her in Spanish about our situation and she gleefully welcomed us inside.\
  \ The couple chatted with us all night. The man ensured he goes to sleep only when\
  \ Mateo is up. His wife served us traditional countryside breakfast that we'd been\
  \ yearning for. Mateo arrived in the morning and thanked his friend for his kind\
  \ gesture. While leaving, we made Mateo communicate to the couple that we'd love\
  \ to host them if they ever come to India. The couple was all smiles. It was our\
  \ last day in Spain."
