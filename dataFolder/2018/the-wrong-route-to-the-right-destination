Text: "The trisection on the road looked confusing. Did we come straight or take the\
  \ turn on our way here? Bewildered, my friend and I parked the car on the roadside\
  \ and tried to remember. With no soul in sight and our mobile networks failing us,\
  \ we truly were lost. We decided to let a coin toss decide our fate. Heads we go\
  \ straight, tails, we take the bend. Flick! Tails. Decision made. We took the bend\
  \ and drove ahead. The road didn\u2019t seem familiar. Maybe the lights were dim\
  \ when we left in the morning. As we proceeded, a village scene unfolded around\
  \ us. Bullock carts laden with wood, people carrying their daily needs on their\
  \ shoulders \u2013 sights we definitely had not encountered on our way here. We\
  \ grew more worried as we realised that hadn't seen such narrow roads before. We\
  \ stopped to ask a passer-by. His directions confirmed our worst fears but he graciously\
  \ told us the way to the main road. In a while, the cottages gave way paddy fields\
  \ beyond which we saw a river. The tar road made driving comfortable; the emerging\
  \ vistas on the side took away the worry.  Just then, I saw something red popping\
  \ up? And it wasn't one small piece. As we drove forward, multiple facades of such\
  \ dispersed beauty emerged. We stopped, astonished by this wonder of nature. A lone\
  \ man on a bicycle was passing by. We waved at him to stop. We enquired about where\
  \ we were. With a bemused smile, he answered, \u201CPathra!\u201D  In West Bengal,\
  \ India, Bishnupur is known as the Terracotta Capital. But I learnt that day that\
  \ more such terracotta gems lay hidden within the state, unknown to the public,\
  \ and often forgotten. Yet they exude beauty and history that mesmerises the mind\
  \ and wills me towards uncovering all such unknown pockets of wonder. Two of us,\
  \ all by chance, were now standing in a place which dates back to 8th Century, to\
  \ a time when this place was a hub of Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism.  The Terracotta\
  \ marvels around us date back to 18th century. We started exploring the long relinquished\
  \ temples one by one, awestruck by its beauty. As a traveller, I normally read up\
  \ about a place before visiting it myself, but here I gained a new experience. I\
  \ explored each of those structures and their artwork, capturing as much as I could\
  \ with my eyes and camera, to go back home and study about. Pathra, which so long\
  \ eluded me, had soaked me in its desolate charm and all of it, by mere chance."
