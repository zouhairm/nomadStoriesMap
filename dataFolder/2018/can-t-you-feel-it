Text: "I was walking through the square on my way to the Bancomer when a low-rider\
  \ SUV blaring a mariachi ballad pulled up next to me. I recognized Carlos and Mauricio\
  \ from my nights out with the hostel crowd. \n\u201COye! Gina! Come with us to the\
  \ bull arena,\u201D Carlos said, leaning out the window. He was athletic and muscular,\
  \ with black hair gelled in big waves. His arm was tan and strong and he squinted\
  \ at me in the hot sun. \n\u201CAre you drinking beer?\u201D I asked, noting the\
  \ open 12-pack on the floorboard. \n\u201CYeah,\u201D Carlos said. \u201CSo what?\
  \ This ain\u2019t the States!\u201D \nCarlos had been in a fight the night before\
  \ and, from what I could understand with my limited Spanish, had hit someone in\
  \ the head with a broken bottle. He had been released from jail that morning after\
  \ Mauricio gave the guard $20. \n\u201CI can\u2019t believe you waited for me, man.\u201D\
  \ Carlos said, switching to English out of courtesy and glancing at Mauricio. \u201C\
  The guards said someone was out there, but I never thought it\u2019d be you. Oye,\
  \ Gina. Me and Mauricio used to work together in the terrace bar at Mama Mia. He\
  \ wore that fucking ring on his thumb all summer. When I think of that summer, man,\
  \ all I can think about is pouring drinks and that fucking ring of his hitting the\
  \ glasses. The girls couldn\u2019t decide between us, man.\u201D \nCarlos drove\
  \ to the bull-fighting arena, where families sat in bleachers and little boys dressed\
  \ like their fathers in jeans and cowboy hats. Carlos wore a baseball hat. \u201C\
  Fuckin\u2019 tamales,\u201D he said, peeling away the corn husk as juice dripped\
  \ down his arm. \u201CGod damn.\u201D It was bright and I was hot in my white tee-shirt\
  \ and jeans. I stared at the sky, blue as a mailbox. \nWe drove back to the square\
  \ at dusk and sat in a corner caf\xE9 eating queso fundido as the church bells gonged.\
  \ A little boy about five years old came in wearing a weathered tuxedo, selling\
  \ roses. Carlos gave him change but refused the rose, \u201CHere you go, ya vete!\u201D\
  \ \nWe talked about the States. Mauricio had never been.\n\u201CIn the States, you\u2019\
  re like a slave,\u201D Carlos said. \n\u201CYou mean, like cubicles and 401Ks?\u201D\
  \ I asked.\nHe took a drag on his cigarette and looked outside at the Parroquia.\
  \ The birds were squawking, settling into the trees for the night. The sky was pink\
  \ and my heart hurt. \n\u201CYeah. San Miguel is different\u2026 can\u2019t you\
  \ feel it?\u201D \nThe mariachis had just come out and were singing up the road.\
  \ \n \u201CYeah,\u201D I said. \u201CI can feel it.\u201D\nThe waiter brought the\
  \ bill.\n\u201CPut your fuckin\u2019 wallet away,\u201D Carlos said. \u201CThis\
  \ ain\u2019t the fuckin\u2019 States.\u201D"
