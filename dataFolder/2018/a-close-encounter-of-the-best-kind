Text: "\u201CAre you okay?\u201D A woman wearing a headscarf asked me while I was\
  \ struggling to keep afloat in the Aegean Sea.  The stones in my neoprene shoes\
  \ were hurting my feet.\nTruth is I expected a sandy beach in Calis, but what I\
  \ found in front of the hotel were endless colorful small rocks. I couldn\u2019\
  t miss it so I had to bear the pain. I wish I had done like my father, who sat down\
  \ in a lounge chair on the grass above the hillside to enjoy one of the major attractions\
  \ of Fethiye: the sunset.\nThere was a gentle breeze that provided a comforting\
  \ relief from the heat of that summer day. My arms and legs embraced the salty warm\
  \ turquoise water and entangled in the waves, which were calm enough to make me\
  \ feel wrapped up by the immensity of the sea in the South of Turkey.\nI asked her\
  \ where she was from. She answered me with two words that piqued my curiosity and\
  \ ruined the initial expectation of nothing but a blissful moment immersed in nature.\
  \ I had a dozen questions about life in Saudi Arabia. Yet the most judgmental question\
  \ I\u2019ve ever asked so far came from my mouth: \u201CSo where is your burka?\u201D\
  \ \nThere was nobody but us 20 meters from the coast swimming towards the sunset,\
  \ like if we were ever going to reach it. \u201CMy husband is nice and he allows\
  \ me not to wear a burka outside the country\u201D, and I just said HA! with a sober\
  \ western high tone of voice. \nEverybody knows that the sunset lasts only a few\
  \ minutes and in places like this you don\u2019t even want to blink your eyes afraid\
  \ of missing contemplating the beauty of the sun sleeping below the green hills.\
  \ We talked during those minutes while looking at the huge yellow sun hiding in\
  \ the horizon and leaving an orange background behind in the sky.\n\u201CAre you\
  \ married?\u201D she asked me. I replied I\u2019m engaged and I don\u2019t know\
  \ If I want to do it. \u201CWhat for?, Losing your freedom?\u201D I said while looking\
  \ down on her polka dot dress. I was wearing a Brazilian G-string.\n\u201CGetting\
  \ married is what all women in Saudi Arabia want. Before that, you are not allowed\
  \ to study, travel abroad, or even go to the cinema alone\u201D, she explained.\
  \  I was not surprised but yet I was confused because many people in the West think\
  \ about marriage as the end of individual freedom. \nThe sun finally disappeared.\
  \ \u201CSee you later\u201D she kindly said and went back to her hotel. I kept swimming\
  \ alone in the dark thinking about life and the concepts of oppression and freedom.\
  \ I ended up submerging my head in the water as a way of drowning my prejudice away."
