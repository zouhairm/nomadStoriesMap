Text: "The city of golden hour, hospitality and custard tarts. That\u2019s what Lisbon\
  \ probably has been described to you. \n\nHowever, in attempts to acquire at least\
  \ one-tenth of the local spirit we end up being the most ordinary tourist. And the\
  \ solution is to shed our skin with all the dust of mediocrity, immerse ourselves\
  \ into the environment - vulnerable, open to experience the randomness of it.\n\n\
  Connection with a place is in the habits, in the attitude. It\u2019s about starting\
  \ to look through one prism with the locals, equally interpret the reality. Perceiving\
  \ green as \u201Cverde\" and morning mist as a prelude to the thrill of the sun.\
  \ Breathing in the same southern air of one of the oldest cities in Europe.\nUnconsciously,\
  \ day-by-day, a part of the local colour dissolves in us, giving in to the impulse\
  \ and desire and thus becoming easier to be absorbed. Effortless, that's how it\
  \ should be.\n\nTo become local in Lisbon one does not have to eat sardines, sitting\
  \ on the riverbank and contemplating the horizon, recite Pessoa, complain about\
  \ poor health, and, having wiped the oil and the remnants of sardines off their\
  \ lips, sing fado straining their voice.\n\nI am not pretending to be a connoisseur,\
  \ neither am I trying to give some pseudo-advice. But as I found out, it is about\
  \ Saturday morning crawls to the flea market, spontaneous findings ranging from\
  \ tea cups which cracks you may romanticize and attribute to a quarrel of an emotional\
  \ couple or ... the pavement (basically, if you do not know whom to blame,\u201D\
  calcada\" is always there) to antique boudoir tables. Early lunches with a local\
  \ during which do not forget to blame the crisis and the lack of social protection\
  \ in all the deadly sins. And another tip: even if you are coming from a country\
  \ under sanctions, pretend that the freshest seafood, for example, octopus or oysters,\
  \ is nothing but a casualty.\n\nBut in general, it does not matter how much time\
  \ you spend (I can not speak for every country but when it comes to Portugal, I\
  \ am sure), every day or hour you lose a part of yourself - microscopic, molecular\
  \ - you leave it on a glass of red wine at dinner (not alla greca\u201D, of course),\
  \ when asking a local which way the patisserie is and who not only sympathizes with\
  \ your country but also used to give concerts there with an orchestra, and\u2026\
  when cursing the city planning.\n\nIt turns out to be kind of barter. Only not mercantile\
  \ at all. Energetic. Exchange of electrons."
