Text: "INDIA: curiosity is woman.\nWe decided to continue on our journey to explore\
  \ a small part of an ancient culture. Smiling children, old men with long white\
  \ beards, dogs, crows, cows, incense, prayers, all kind and background smells, bright\
  \ colors under the monsoon rains, enriched our discoveries from weeks.\nThat evening,\
  \ after preparing backpacks and hugging family hosted us for three days, we walked\
  \ towards the bus station, from where we would move to Varkala. A bungalow on the\
  \ beach was waiting for us. A short rest before Mumbai, the incredible city.\nSitting\
  \ at the bus shelter, intrigued, we were observing the small station nightlife:\
  \ a skinny man with large parcels tied with improvised ropes running from one bus\
  \ to another, a small group of clear blue dressed men bringing animals they bought\
  \ for their families, fathers mothers and children holding hands, looking for the\
  \ bus would bring them home. Lots of people in movement, a dancing humanity.\nHypnotized\
  \ by the vibrant spectacle, we did not realize that while we were watching at them,\
  \ they were watching at us.\nUnexpectedly, quiet and light like feathers blowing\
  \ in the wind, four young women appeared in front of us.\nThe major, no older than\
  \ thirty, holding a girl of four in her arms. Other two, eight and ten, walked with\
  \ her. In a few moments, silently, they surrounded us. They were smiling at us.\
  \ And we to them. The little hands of the baby girl promptly slipped into the beard\
  \ of Him, while the others\u2019 two firmly grabbed my right one. After turning\
  \ my hand, the girls began to walk the palm lines with the tip of their tapered\
  \ fingers. Dumbfounded, I remained listening to that silent reading. After few moments,\
  \ and a brief exchange between them, the major told to one of the two girls, to\
  \ translate a question. The younger, in a very broken English, asked me: \"You?\
  \ work?\". Staring the girl in her deep beautiful dark eyes, with my hand imprisoned\
  \ between theirs, I answered yes. A short silence between us. And then her unmistakable\
  \ voice \"What? this hands? Aha! You no work! \".\nSuddenly everything was clear\
  \ to me. Smiling and gesturing, I tried to explain I usually work with my imagination.\
  \ A static silence, interrupted by a big laugh, was their response. With my eyes\
  \ wide open for the amazement and my hand yet between theirs, I began to laugh too.\
  \ Shortly after, the elder, gently but firmly, passed me the little girl she was\
  \ holding in her arms. I had become part of their circle of trust. We had become\
  \ friends."
