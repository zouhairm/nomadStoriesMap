Text: "Ladies and gentlemen, are you ready for the ride? Forty pairs of eyes are looking\
  \ at me, some with expectation, some with bored expressions. Even better, the second\
  \ group just became my challenge of the day \u2013 at the end, they will be interacting\
  \ the most. I am ready to turn all those tourists into Madrid-enthusiasts. Two hours.\
  \ That is all I get for such a task but at the end it will be plenty. Madrid makes\
  \ my job easier as it speaks for itself.\n\nLet\u2019s start at the Puerta del Sol,\
  \ the Times Square of Madrid. Look around. Ten streets leading into this square\
  \ are placed in a rather disorganized fashion. They all have different widths and\
  \ are attached at random angles to each other and the square. It seems a bit chaotic,\
  \ right? The (un)structure of Madrid is what makes it so mysterious. You can easily\
  \ get lost while wandering through the streets. While exploring, look down. You\
  \ might find the golden plaques in front of business that have been in service for\
  \ more than a hundred years.\n\nOf course I am taking you to the oldest one as well.\
  \ For almost 300 years, the restaurant Bot\xEDn has been in business without any\
  \ interruptions. That makes it the oldest restaurant in Madrid, and wait\u2026 even\
  \ in Spain\u2026 in Europe\u2026 and YES\u2026 in the world! Let me also mention\
  \ that Francisco Goya was a dishwasher here. Are you excited yet? My ace up in the\
  \ sleeve is Ernest Hemingway and his love for Spanish pubs and restaurants. Don\
  \ Ernesto was a regular client here and he even placed many scenes in his books\
  \ to the Bot\xEDn restaurant.\n\nFancy a dessert? How about some pastries that are\
  \ sold in a monastery? Even though the nuns living there are not allowed to be seen,\
  \ you can communicate with them through a closed door and purchase those delicious\
  \ sweets. However, do not come in the afternoon, as there is a break, so-called\
  \ siesta, from about 2 p.m. up until 5 p.m. This energy-saving regime comes in handy\
  \ at night as all parties start a few hours past the midnight.\n\nBut before I give\
  \ you suggestions to where to go out, we have to stop in front of the Royal Palace.\
  \ I am going to be telling you that it is the biggest European royal palace still\
  \ in use. I will let you guess how many rooms this palace contains and we will slowly\
  \ progress to an incredible number of 3418 rooms. Have I finally gotten your attention?\
  \ My two hours are over and we have not even talked about bullfighting, flamenco\
  \ and the Spanish inquisition. I will be waiting for you right where we left off.\
  \ To be continued\u2026"
