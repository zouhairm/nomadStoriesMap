Text: "Do you believe in bad luck? I assume that every person has had it at least\
  \ once in his life. You think that you have planned everything, considered every\
  \ detail in your trip. However, do not forget that life has a good sense of humor\
  \ and it may add some unexpected circumstances to your journey. Who knows maybe\
  \ it will be your adventure of a lifetime (well, if you manage to survive it). As\
  \ you may have thought I managed to survive mine and now I have a story to tell.\
  \ \n26 August or 238 day of 2017. I was finishing my summer work at a typical American\
  \ camp by the sea. While packing everything-I-need-to-survive luggage my mind flooded\
  \ with excitement and worry. \nReady? Steady? Go! Dallas, here I come! It had seemed\
  \ like nothing could ruin my perfect mood until my friend informed me that we had\
  \ to cancel our trip to Houston, San Antonio and Jacob\u2019s Well due to hurricane\
  \ Harvey. I was terrified by watching all news concerning this nature disaster.\
  \ A lot of people have lost their homes, so, complaining about canceling travel\
  \ plans was not appropriate in this kind of situation. I have decided to spend 5\
  \ days in Dallas exploring every corner of it. \n2 days until my next destination,\
  \ the city of my dream, New Orleans. While I was searching for the best donuts place\
  \ in the city I received an e-mail from the airline about the flood warning in New\
  \ Orleans. I decided to change my flight date in order to safe my trip. Fortunately,\
  \ rain failed to prevent me from falling in love with this city. A nice walk around\
  \ the French Quarter with its unbelievable energy and live performances made me\
  \ forget about all my misfortunes that I had experienced before. I thought that\
  \ the black line of my life has finally ended. I have never been so wrong in my\
  \ life.\nThen Florida welcomed me with open arms. The natural beauty and calmness\
  \ of Key West left a mark on my heart. Everything had seemed so perfect until the\
  \ news about hurricane Irma reached me. While some people were preparing to face\
  \ the nature disaster, others were celebrating and waiting for the hurricane. Fortunately,\
  \ I had managed to leave Florida before the disaster came (did I mention that my\
  \ flight was canceled?). \nDespite all unexpected and dangerous circumstances this\
  \ trip was one of the most interesting and challenging. It turned out that my bad\
  \ luck helped me to become more adventurous person. Traveling is all about push\
  \ yourself out of your comfort zone. Life loves the brave!"
