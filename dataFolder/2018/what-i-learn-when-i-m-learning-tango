Text: "A strange idea came to me, as I sat at the table by a colorful street in La\
  \ Boca.\n\nThe neighborhood in Buenos Aires was brimming with music, art and tango\
  \ performance. To drink a cup of coffee and enjoy a carefree afternoon, that was\
  \ the idea.\n\nYet somehow \u2014 probably because I was bored and thus bold \u2014\
  \ it suddenly stroke me that, as the street tango dancers finished their performance,\
  \ maybe I could join them, not just to pose for a photo, but to have an actual dance.\n\
  \nThe truth was, back then, my tango was just at a beginner's level. Before I decided\
  \ to spend one month in the Argentine capital, dancing had never been part of my\
  \ life. Just out of curiosity, and because of a deep echo that the tango music aroused\
  \ from within me, I decided to learn one of the most difficult dances in the world.\n\
  \nYet I couldn't lead.\n\n\"This is how I felt when you were leading,\" said Lucia,\
  \ my Tango teacher. She and I switched roles, and this time she would lead the way\
  \ that I just did.\n\nSoulless. Passionless. Restless.\n\n\"And this is the right\
  \ feeling.\" This time, she held my hand firmly. Forceful to the right point. No\
  \ push. No hurry. I felt her positive energy, a strange mixture of confidence, determination\
  \ and passion transcending into graceful improvised steps.\n\nMy first Tango class.\
  \ \n\nA few classes later, I had a new challenge at hand \u2014 how to do it in\
  \ public? \n\nJust a bunch of strangers, I told myself. No one would care about\
  \ me beyond the fact that I might make a fool of myself, should I do something wrong.\n\
  \nAfter a nod from the dancer, I went up. My left hand holding her right hand, my\
  \ right hand on the center of her back \u2014 in an open embrace, I was ready to\
  \ dance. \n\nOnly I couldn't. Once the impulse waned, my feet petrified.\n\nThen\
  \ I heard Lucia's voice. \"You have too many doubts.That was why your steps felt\
  \ lost.\n\n\"Throw the doubts out of the window,\" Gerry, her husband, added.\n\n\
  They didn't know me, and yet they knew me well enough through simple dance steps.\n\
  \nToo many doubts. About life, society and myself. \n\n\"Now let me feel your energy,\"\
  \ Lucia said.\n\nI took a breath, cleared my mind and held the hand of the dancer.\
  \ I stroke my foot forward, trying not to think about how I should make the next\
  \ step.\n\nSide step, weight change, forward, cross and resolution.\n\nBefore I\
  \ knew it, it was done.\n\n\"If you want, I can give you a private lesson in your\
  \ hotel room,\" she whispered in my ear, after the dance.\n\nI shook my head. I\
  \ had already got more than I wanted."
