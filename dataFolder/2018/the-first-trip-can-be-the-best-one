Text: "The first trip abroad is unforgettable to anyone\u2019s life \u2013 whether\
  \ it turns into an awesome or an awful experience. To me, despite some difficulties,\
  \ it was completely awesome since I had been dreaming of doing that for so long.\
  \ So, let me tell you about my first trip, which began unexpectedly, had some funny\
  \ and great moments.\nBy chance, I met a friend from college at my former job, whom\
  \ I had not seen for about two years up to that occasion. We were talking a little\
  \ about some trivialities to the moment he said he was going on an exchange program\
  \ in Canada. I can say that short and fast moment was a turning point in my life.\
  \ Was there anything special about him or what we were talking about? Not exactly,\
  \ some other people had told me about exchange programs before and nothing beyond\
  \ a normal conversation happened. However, that particular one had not been ordinary\
  \ like others, it suddenly awoke in me the need to get my hands dirty to accomplish\
  \ my big dream, rather than keep dreaming about it. So, yes, there was something\
  \ special in that talk, and it came from me, with a little help from my friend.\
  \ It was a minute decision, an instant that an incommensurable and unimaginable\
  \ willpower suddenly took over me, in order then to switch the words from my old\
  \ pessimistic \u201CIt is possible, but it is very difficult\u201D thought to a\
  \ new and exciting \u201CIt is difficult, but it is very possible\u201D affirmation.\
  \ \nOne year later, my dream was coming true and I was about to go on an exchange\
  \ program in that same country, Canada. From the moment I entered the plane, I could\
  \ feel my blood running through my veins and getting stuck in my face, I was blushing\
  \ for mixed feelings of nervousness and enthusiasm. Also, I was a little afraid:\
  \ it was my first time flying on a plane! This experience began in a messy way,\
  \ but now I can\u2019t help but laugh whenever I remember this. After arriving at\
  \ Vancouver, I found out my luggage lock was damaged, I was out of credit to make\
  \ an important phone call and, furthermore, I got lost on my way to the host family\
  \ house. Nevertheless, Murphy\u2019s law couldn\u2019t defeat my boldness and determination\
  \ to make this trip great. In the end, everything worked out well and I had the\
  \ best trip of my life. What lessons have I learned from it? To have the courage\
  \ to take risks when necessary and stay calm in stressful situations. Besides, not\
  \ to be afraid of asking for some help is, most of the time, a nice idea - you can\
  \ make special friends along the way!"
