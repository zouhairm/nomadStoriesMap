Text: "In my twenties I spent two years living in Edinburgh, Scotland. At the end\
  \ of my time there I set out for a journey through the European continent. After\
  \ participating in some group tours, I was concluding my trip with a little solo\
  \ travelling. In Prague I was staying in a small apartment away from the bustling\
  \ tourist center of the Old Town Square. Like a good traveler I learned a few phrases\
  \ in the native tongue to help me interact effectively with the local people in\
  \ their own language. While stocking up at a nearby grocery store, I attempted to\
  \ use some Czech greetings on the cashier. My \u201CAhoj, jak se mate?\u201D was\
  \ met with a smile and a response in Czech that I wasn\u2019t able to comprehend.\
  \ My confused look and quick stammering in English was met with a bigger smile and\
  \ a longer response in English. The young man named Josef was excited for the opportunity\
  \ to practice speaking English.\n\nWe quickly launched into an in depth conversation\
  \ that was only halted by the interruption of annoyed customers who wanted to pay\
  \ for their groceries and get on with their day. Josef graciously offered to meet\
  \ up with me when he was not occupied by work. This would give us the chance to\
  \ continue our conversation and he could show me around his beautiful city. I accepted\
  \ his offer and we set a date.\n\nWe walked, talked and took in the beauty of his\
  \ city. For the next two days Josef and I engaged in wonderful conversation about\
  \ his knowledge of Prague, my travel experiences and our shared passion for hockey.\n\
  \nA climb up to the incredible Prague Castle provided captivating views of the city.\
  \ Strolling leisurely across the Charles Bridge put us under the watchful stare\
  \ of the statues of the Saints. We sat in the Old Town Square, where we basked in\
  \ the sun and observed the frenzy of activity, including dozens of brides and grooms\
  \ engaging in a photos shoot. Josef also took me on a more personal journey for\
  \ him through the Jewish district, with history of the Second World War and the\
  \ legend of the Golem.\n\nJosef\u2019s local knowledge took me to unique cafes in\
  \ obscure areas away from the tourist horde and exposed me to nightlife, rich in\
  \ activity. Making a local connection allowed me to experience Prague as a local\
  \ with an engaging guide and gave me an amazing experience in a beautiful city that\
  \ I will never forget."
