Text: "One word escaped my lips in answer to the question.  That same word darted\
  \ about as flights were booked and accommodation confirmed. It agreed to a three-day\
  \ stopover in Abu Dhabi followed by six glorious days in Santorini.   It took me\
  \ out of my comfort zone and introduced me to the notion of \u2018a girls\u2019\
  \ trip'.  Sure I\u2019d traveled before, numerous trips with my family and even\
  \ a few solo adventures, but I\u2019d never holidayed with a group of female friends.\
  \  \n\nIt soon became my word for the entire trip.  At first, this concept wrestled\
  \ with the planner in me so I only used it occasionally.  But in time as I uttered\
  \ it more frequently any doubts I\u2019d normally have just seemed to disappear.\
  \  No more \u2018what ifs\u2019 messing with my mind and \u2018maybes\u2019 didn\u2019\
  t even get a look in.  I found that the more I said yes the easier life became.\
  \  \n\nSaying yes to Abu Dhabi meant an amazing experience of intrigue and rhythm.\
  \ Yes to the blend of old and new.  Yes to the city\u2019s primal heady mix of sounds\
  \ and smells, which constantly opposed its striking glass skyline. Yes to the Sheikh\
  \ Zayed Mosque while wearing an Abaya. Yes, Abu Dhabi was the perfect prelude to\
  \ Santorini.\n\nYes was my mantra driving from the airport to Oia.  It pushed me\
  \ up the cobbled streets past the intriguing houses. It roared from my throat when\
  \ we opened the front door to our holiday home.  It occasionally got soaked in ouzo\
  \ and giggled with us as we sat in the pool waiting for each breathtaking sunset.\
  \  Yes, I loved this word and our postcard perfect villa. \n\nMy favored word propelled\
  \ me up the 256 stairs from the small bay of Amoudi to the village of Oia. Trust\
  \ me, I needed the assistance.  Not only was it a tough climb but I found it hard\
  \ to leave our lunch spot.  Dimitri\u2019s Tavern safely nestled in the commanding\
  \ red rock with every table facing the exquisite water.  Yes, the water splashing\
  \ our table legs was blue.  Oh, and teal.   And yes, definitely azure with touches\
  \ of navy. \n\nI was content with my new word, almost to the point of being smug,\
  \ until one evening coming back from Fira.  We were speeding through the narrow\
  \ streets, too fast for the space available and much too fast considering the sheer\
  \ drop on the right-hand side. While balancing dangerously on the edge of the road\
  \ our driver felt obliged to check his phone messages while driving! \n\nThankfully\
  \ we stayed road bound.  And sometime during our ride, my heart returned to its\
  \ normal pace but not before forgetting my mantra while I screamed no!"
