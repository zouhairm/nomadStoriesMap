Text: "After a lively night in my bed -I knew where I needed to go next. That night\
  \ I had dreamt of a shady beach under a rainy sky with thunder crackling above.\
  \ The message I awoke with told me was about a mysterious location: Guatemala. I\
  \ had never before within my travels thought about exploring Central America, but\
  \ the feeling the dream left me with was like an engine going faster and grinding\
  \ in my chest. A month later I was on a plane, with little cash and a bell ringing\
  \ in my head- you're doing it again. Pushing your limits and edges beyond the horizon\
  \ of you comfort-zone. Smiling and uncertainly looking out the window, I was going\
  \ to explore this mysterious message I've received. \nMy first stop was in Mexico\
  \ City, going southeast through Oaxaca, towards San Cristobal. Finally crossing\
  \ the border to Guatemala, my excitement grew steady. My goal wasn't a specific\
  \ city, I would just know when I had reached the perfect time and place, enjoying\
  \ the marvelous scene of old mayan land along the way. Then- I knew I had arrived.\
  \ It took me about 4 long weeks to reach the colonial town Antigua. \nThe culture,\
  \ people and nature had already baffled me beyond reason, but following that grinding\
  \ voice in my heart I knew when I saw this mysterious charm of the architecture.\
  \ \nFor days I wandered around in the grid of streets, melting away in the sun,\
  \ drowning in the floods of the heavy rains. I had to admit it, I felt lost and\
  \ confused beyond what my stubbornness admitted. The last thing I expected in the\
  \ streets muddle was to encounter a very special Guatemalan man. It felt like it\
  \ was God, the universe or what ever mysterious force I had been following lately,\
  \ revealed itself in his eyes. \nChristian had an incredible history, a story of\
  \ been working under a corrupt president, losing his business, everything he owned,\
  \ having to move in with his mother at the age of 35, encounter God several times\
  \ over in his task of terminating the walls of Ego. Only to find himself wanting\
  \ to spread a crystal clear message. He moved to the perfect location -Antigua,\
  \ and started a restaurant-business. He turned the small place into a beautiful,\
  \ thriving holisitic source of healing and spiritual information. Connecting Gods\
  \ messages with yoga, food and an alternative lifestyle, Christian was vibrant.\n\
  \nAfter spending 8 more weeks there, I had another lively night in his house. Under\
  \ the full moon I had a very vivd dream about me opening a holsitic restaurant.\
  \ The locations this time: Norway"
