Text: "Rolling chalk in my fingers, I froze. What was I doing? The humidity and the\
  \ chalk made a paste on my hands. I cleared my throat. The only thing for miles\
  \ that was dry. The class stared blankly, bored. A boy, on a whim, yelled: \"who\
  \ are you?\" I'd been wondering that since I arrived here last week. I shifted,\
  \ the air was thick. It amplified my nerves and the dreamlike atmosphere. Who was\
  \ I? The room was dark and filled with unamused kids in orange robes. All boys,\
  \ aged 6-11, they'd had many teachers. There were no expectations. A fly landed\
  \ on my sticky hand. I glanced down. It registered that there was a little hand\
  \ on mine. A tiny hand had rested there and waited. I followed it up until I found\
  \ the face. He smiled at me so brightly it lit up his eyes and illuminated the understanding\
  \ there. His hands, also covered in chalk, he had written his name on the board.\
  \ He led me over. \"Write,\" he said.\n\nLahiru was six. The only boy wearing an\
  \ Elmo shirt with a full head of hair. Not yet ordained as a novice monk, his status\
  \ isolated him. Though, alone and liminal as he was, Lahiru knew his purpose. For\
  \ that month, his purpose was befriending the awkward, American teacher with the\
  \ sticky hand. \n\nFor me, Sri Lanka was an unknown place. I traveled there on a\
  \ whim after my life left me aching to find magic in a mundane existence. I picked\
  \ the most unfamiliar destination and crossed my fingers. Magic, did not meet me\
  \ at the airport. I was slammed into a wall of humidity and spent the next month\
  \ adjusting to challenges, the primary being my job. While teaching, my connection\
  \ with the monks never got easier. Yet, every day Lahiru's smile greeted me, the\
  \ little chalky hand waved its support and it gave me hope. \n\nI went to Sri Lanka\
  \ for a grand adventure, instead, I found a simple gesture of human kindness. A\
  \ boy with an Elmo shirt and chalky hands had understood me. A stranger had seen\
  \ my need to believe and had put his little hand on mine. In a world of disconnection,\
  \ it was magic in its purest form. Back home, things were still ordinary, but my\
  \ worldview wasn't. Later, a friend sent me a photo of my class. I searched for\
  \ a t-shirt and a puff of hair and my heart fell when I didn't find him. I smiled\
  \ when I spotted Lahiru. Not a boy in an old t-shirt, but the newest ordained novice\
  \ monk, glowing with pride and a freshly shaved head. The rest of the class embraced\
  \ him as he beamed in his bright orange robes and just a tiny bit of chalk smudged\
  \ on his little hand."
