Text: "All I had wanted was a bag of fried bananas before work. But, as I thanked\
  \ the banana man and started up the street to the Thai high school where I worked,\
  \ a rustling sound from the long grass stopped me. A python head appeared from the\
  \ ditch, followed by a body longer than I am tall. It was lumpy and bulging in spots\
  \ from what I assumed was its last meal.  I back-pedaled, wondering what exactly\
  \ had been its last meal, and if it found humans as tasty as I did fried bananas.\
  \ \nAs stunned as I was to see a huge serpent blocking my commute to work, I felt\
  \ bad for the poor guy as he coiled back, feeling his belly slide onto the rough\
  \ surface of the sidewalk. We aren\u2019t in the swamp anymore, I imagined him thinking.\n\
  People halted, unable to continue without stepping into the constant road traffic,\
  \ into the ditch, or over the giant reptile now stretched across the path. I joined\
  \ the crowd in choosing the fourth option, which was to wait and see what happened.\
  \ \nThe snake was blocking the entrance to a laundry shop and an old man wearing\
  \ a white tank top and flip flops stepped out towards the snake armed with nothing\
  \ but a long metal pole and a burlap bag. \nTo my horror, the intention of the old\
  \ man became clear as he prodded the snake in the head with the pole in an attempt\
  \ to coerce it into the bag. While the snake didn\u2019t particularly like the sidewalk,\
  \ he was even more offended by the idea of having his bulging body dumped inside\
  \ the sack and transported elsewhere. \nHe demonstrated his indignation at this\
  \ development by striking at the pole and hissing. While I felt a little sorry for\
  \ the python, I also admired the brave old man who was now swinging the sack at\
  \ the snake\u2019s head like a bullfighter, gracefully dodging inches from the striking\
  \ mouth, his only shield the thin rod.  \nThe crowd let out hisses of breath when\
  \ the snake struck, narrowly missing the man\u2019s bare shins. Finally, when I\
  \ wondered if the snake would triumph, another man stepped out of the shop. This\
  \ one was younger, presumably the older man\u2019s grandson, with stooping shoulders,\
  \ a dragon tattooed across his shirtless chest, and a cigarette hanging from his\
  \ lips. \nHe grabbed the pole and without taking the cigarette from his mouth began\
  \ prodding the snake into the bag. The poor python was no match against the two\
  \ of them and within seconds and a few more hissing strikes, his head was shoved\
  \ into the bag. The grandson deftly lifted coil after coil of the writhing body\
  \ until it disappeared inside."
