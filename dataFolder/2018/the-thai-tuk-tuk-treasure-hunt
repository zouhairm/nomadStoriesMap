Text: "He honked at us from his colorful Tuk-Tuk as we stepped out of our hotel gate\
  \ in Bangkok after a hearty complimentary brunch. Two Indian ladies \u2013 my mum\
  \ & I \u2013 determined not to waste a minute of our Thai holiday. He offered to\
  \ take us around the locality\u2019s attractions with a quick stopover at the neighborhood\
  \ gem museum: 50 Baht, just 100 Indian rupees a quick mental calculation revealed,\
  \ was a bargain for a guided tour even with a sponsored halt at a gems store. \u201C\
  I\u2019m Anurak, Sawatdee-krap.\u201D We had learned from the inflight magazine\
  \ that it\u2019s Thai for Hello! It seemed we had been shanghaied by a \u201Cgem\u201D\
  \ of a guardian angel! Anurak in Thai, we later found out, meant male angel \u2013\
  \ apt for our tuk-tuk guide!  \nHe \u201Cflew\u201D us straight to a nearby \u201C\
  Gem Palace.\u201D Garlanded with purple orchids to a chorus of Sawatdee-kah by pretty\
  \ girls in tradition Thai attire we were shown a 10-minute documentary on gemstone\
  \ mining in Thailand & the history of that particular \u201Cmuseum.\u201D Then we\
  \ were whisked by jaw-dropping exhibits onto a blingy shopfloor. The glitter & prices\
  \ of the gems & jewelry made our heads spin. It was two very dazed ladies who climbed\
  \ back into Anurak\u2019s tuk-tuk. He seemed to have gauged our mood & took us to\
  \ a beautiful Buddhist temple. Its serenity restored us even as its mother of pearl\
  \ inlaid dark wooden doors wowed us!\nAnurak then drove us past the closed night\
  \ market but reassured us it was just a 15-mins walk from our hotel & just as quickly\
  \ we were at Bangkok\u2019s famous floating flower market on \u201Cklong\u201D!\
  \ As we handed him the 50 baht thinking our trip was over, he waved it away, \u201C\
  I wait. I take you shopping & another gem museum\u2026still pay me only 50 baht.\u201D\
  \ \nAfter a sensory overload at the flower market on the canal \u2013 what with\
  \ the bright blooms & their dizzying perfumes fighting the miasmic canal \u2013\
  \ we were happy to be whisked off by Anurak to shop. \n\u201CIs cheap. No tourist\
  \ price. I wait there,\u201D he instructed as we clambered out pointing to a nearby\
  \ seafood cart. In just 45-mins we were loaded with bags full of souvenirs & very\
  \ fashionable (for us!) clothes, shoes & handbags all at bargain-basement rates!\
  \ Anurak had chilled shaved king coconuts waiting for us in the tuk-tuk. Welcome\
  \ treat for us weary shoppers. As we gulped down the chilled nectar-like coconut\
  \ water Anurak drew up outside another \u201CGem Palace\u201D! Surrounded by rubies\
  \ & emeralds we succumbed to the lure of the gems & bought a beautiful brooch studded\
  \ with uncut rubies! Jackpot for Anurak & us!"
