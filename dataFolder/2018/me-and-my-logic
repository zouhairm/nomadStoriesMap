Text: "Travel is not an expression of taking a break from my ever hectic life style\
  \ of working as a corporate lawyer... BUT; a essence of seeing, feeling; acknowledging\
  \ the facts of life from the eyes of beautiful circumstances that you fall into...be\
  \ it a wrong lane, stream or road...people like me living in their everyday life\
  \ envious of me and my adventure as a woman able to the see their world at my leisure\
  \ and my own time...\nUnderstanding enjoying the solitude, peacefulness, loving\
  \ the serenity; simplicity of the joy of being myself with no of what so ever inhibition\
  \ at all !! \nLife with its simple logic that world created for our ease & comfort\
  \ for ourself and for people around us. Based on no discrimination but for enjoyment\
  \ for all the sounds; the sights ; the smells be it tantalising food or sights to\
  \ the wonderment of the creations that are sometimes cannot be expressed or caught\
  \ under a camera lens no matter how good we may be; it could only be felt within\
  \ our souls..the moments the seconds!\nTo visit any country , city(ies), you it's\
  \ a privilege and a honor. A honour to see, feel and to love and respect humanity\
  \ in it's wonderful color  of pain; worry; loss and the happiness each eye that\
  \ you glimse here and there while walking; sitting in a metro or even while waiting\
  \ for your flight call the eyes of that city tells you all be it from urban or low\
  \ village ally. It's the eyes of a child; woman, an inspiring group of mischievous\
  \ youth or group of ever winking old man gang the eyes in their every day moment\
  \ gives out the true spirit of that city and that country!\nI love to explore the\
  \ origin; the artefacts; the arte cultural and the raw dimension of community living\
  \ within multi layer of diverse culture in any visiting city with their songs, music,\
  \ food and ever revolving  dress style ..\nThe aristocratic as well as the home\
  \ less in their fullest splendour called Life!"
