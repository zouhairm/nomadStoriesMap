Text: "\u201CI have to leave you now\u201D, he said with detachment. He was so close\
  \ yet I couldn\u2019t touch him nor stop him. \n\nI woke up as I did so many times\
  \ before. My heart pounding and my eyes in tears, I realized that I was not home\
  \ and that he had been gone for months. I pulled the curtains and, for a moment,\
  \ I watched the palm trees sway in the wind. My nightmares had found me even in\
  \ Bali, a deeply foreign island. They had followed me in the rice fields, somewhere\
  \ between the mountains and the sea. \n\nI should have been prepared for the moment\
  \ when he would leave, I thought to myself.  But even though I knew it was inevitable,\
  \ I still could not accept it. \n\nI went for a walk hoping to get distracted by\
  \ the warmth of the sun and the noise of the scooters. Staring-eyed masks with protruding\
  \ tongues were watching over me, hanging from the fronts of the stores. I started\
  \ hearing the hypnotic gamelan, a noise which attracted me and frightened me at\
  \ the same time. I dared to get closer. \n\nBalinese women were parading in their\
  \ colorful sarongs and their intricate lace blouses, holding on their heads baskets\
  \ filled with fruit offerings for the Gods. Their gorgeous black hair was respectfully\
  \ tied with fresh, golden flowers hidden behind the ear. Earthly-skinned men were\
  \ carrying a high tower built of bamboo and decorated with tinsel and silks. The\
  \ young and the old alike were being part of the most sacred duty: the ceremonial\
  \ burning of the remainings of the dead to liberate his soul so that he can reincarnate\
  \ into a better being. \n\nI followed them to the cremation grounds. The corpse\
  \ was carefully placed into an ox-shaped cardboard, the Balinese coffin, which,\
  \ after being covered in ornaments, offerings and the prayers of the Brahmanic priest,\
  \ was set on fire. I found myself standing right next to the burning ox. The faces\
  \ of the natives revealed themselves to me, with brightness in their eyes and joyful\
  \ smiles.  \n\nIt was at those extravagant festivities, among those people who celebrated\
  \ death, that I understood why he appeared so content in my dreams. He was finally\
  \ free. I burned an incense stick in his honor, wishing him a safe travel and hoping\
  \ to meet him on his return to this earth. I knew that my nightmares would not come\
  \ back again because there I was, on the other side of the planet, learning to embrace\
  \ death."
