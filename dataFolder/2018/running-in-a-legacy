Text: "As I created another rolling hill I was met with the most awe inspiring brilliant\
  \ sunrises I've ever seen. I knew in that moment I would cherish ever morning run\
  \ I had the privilege to go on till the day I died. I chose New Zeland not just\
  \ because it's a beautiful country but because of its running heritage. I've been\
  \ running and racing ever since I started at it competitively as a 7th grader.\n\
  The instant I set foot in New Zealand I felt at home, the people were so friendly\
  \ and I could believe how beautiful the town's were and just how brilliantly they\
  \ flowed with the natural landscape. I was off sight seeing as soon as I had a chance\
  \ to toss my luggage in my room and lace up my hiking shoes.\nIn the first day alone\
  \ I explored and ventured up Auckland's Cornwall Park. I could have stayed there\
  \ all day just taking in the landscape but since it was already a touch past noon\
  \ I had a lunch reservation to uphold. I was in and out as fast as I could eat.\
  \ I didn't want to waste a moment cooped up inside a busy restaraunt when I could\
  \ be out exploring the island. \nBy the end of my time in New Zealand I had made\
  \ some unforgettable memories and some life long friends with fellow runners I'd\
  \ met out on my runs.\nThere is nothing like seeing a landscape from a formidable\
  \ view, except going off to run in that landscape and see it up close and person."
