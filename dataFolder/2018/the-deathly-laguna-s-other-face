Text: "The sound of a rumbling earth interrupts the engine of our rented Toyota, and\
  \ through the haze a group of gauchos wearing thin black sombreros becomes visible,\
  \ guiding a flock of sheep which appears to be running wild. We ask them for directions,\
  \ and end up on a whole new route, towards the toxic, volcanic Laguna del Diamante,\
  \ which mysteriously brims with life. Driving in the smouldering heat, it\u2019\
  s hard not to recall memories of walking through dense forests, filled with even\
  \ denser bird songs all mixed into a loud soundtrack. Our first stop on the journey\
  \ had been a retreat to the Lacar lake, and splashing through it by kayak, the rhythmic\
  \ ores seemed a world apart from the silence of the dusty roads surrounding us.\
  \ Mountaintops now filled the view as we breezed over the Route 40. No minute did\
  \ we miss the grayscale landscape of London \u2014 the glazed corporate buildings\
  \ of Bank replaced by ever changing dark yellows, greens and blues as far as the\
  \ eye could see. \n\nAfter a few hours we arrive at a traditional Argentine maize\
  \ farm for the night, not far from the Agua del Toro reservoir, the sky bursting\
  \ before the sun at last falls away leaving only an endless cover of dark blue.\
  \ The host Santiago and his wife Martina are just putting tools inside a large shed\
  \ next to the driveway when we walk up to the main door. They show us our room and\
  \ insist on sharing dinner: local produce from their grill overlooking the corn\
  \ fields. \n\nFastfoward twelve hours and we\u2019re back in the car, the sunrise\
  \ warming the golden corn heads as we head out north, driving through fields of\
  \ sunflowers at the crack of dawn. After two hours a sign with Laguna del Diamante\
  \ comes up abruptly and requires us to take a left turn onto Route 98, a dust road\
  \ as could have been seen in the movies when people are either high on peyote or\
  \ buried after a serial killer has had their way. A small river widens up on our\
  \ right. We pass the stone gates of a camping ground. The mountains now enclose\
  \ us on both sides as we drive upwards and onwards. The road zig zags. Snow. Trees.\
  \ A dozen dramatic turns. We slow the pace. Another campground, Refugio El Cilindro,\
  \ and beyond we can see a white top perching like a bird on the highest tree. After\
  \ a few seconds, the greatest surprise, what the gauchos had not told us and we\
  \ least expected, right in front of the Maipo volcano: hundreds of pink flamingos,\
  \ striding their sticky legs graciously, awakening the world with their calls."
