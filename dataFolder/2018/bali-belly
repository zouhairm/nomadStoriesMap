Text: "If you asked me what called me to Bali, I couldn't really tell you. Suddenly\
  \ I was in the Bali jungle, alone, for 5 weeks. When I arrived, I quickly learned\
  \ that there would be a lot of inner work and soul searching to be done. I surrendered\
  \ to the pace of the jungle and vowed to live presently and in the moment. However,\
  \ it wasn't until I crashed my scooter into a ditch while stressed about \"American\
  \ tourist\" first world problems, that I truly allowed Bali to be my teacher. From\
  \ that day forward, I discarded all need to control my Bali journey and took things\
  \ \"slowly slowly,\" just like the little Balinese woman had advised me earlier\
  \ on.\n\nWithin the first week, I met an expat who read my palm and told me about\
  \ a circle door I would soon enter. The next day, I decided to try a new cafe called\
  \ \"Clear Cafe\", only to discover that the door to the cafe was the shape of a\
  \ circle. I entered, ate my breakfast and as I was finishing up, a handsome Australian\
  \ man came through the doors. I smiled, he smiled. I packed my things and exited.\
  \ As I looked back, I saw the same handsome man looking my way through the circle\
  \ door. I waved, and moments later we begun to walk towards each other. From there\
  \ he told me about the \"Red String of Fate\" article he was reading when I walked\
  \ by and how he heard a whisper say to him, \"You're missing something.\" He told\
  \ himself, \"If she looks back, Ill talk to her,\" and it was after that moment,\
  \ that I looked back and waved. \n\nFrom there, we spent the next month delving\
  \ into a sweet romance. I shared my favorite music and my love for eggs on toast,\
  \ while he shared the secrets of tantra and the plant medicine of Ayuahasca. We\
  \ shared amazing meals together and took many scooter rides through the streets\
  \ of Bali...I was most fond of those rides. \n\nSoon all this would come to an end,\
  \ as my departure date was approaching. Despite the time we shared, we decided it\
  \ was best to end things before I flew back to Los Angeles. We didnt see how it\
  \ could logistically work with us living on complete opposite sides of the world.\
  \ He had a 7 year old son that was coming to live with him and I needed to figure\
  \ out my life in Los Angeles. We said our goodbyes and returned back to our lives\
  \ as we knew them. \n\nI flew back to Los Angeles...three weeks later I discovered\
  \ a seed had been planted.\n\nThe Bali story continues as this Bali belly grows...11\
  \ weeks and counting."
