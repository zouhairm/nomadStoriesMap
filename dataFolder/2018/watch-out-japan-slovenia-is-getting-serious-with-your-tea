Text: "It can be roasted. Toasted. Picked before maturation or after it has bloomed.\
  \ It can be mixed with aromatics to give more depth of flavor or left on its own.\
  \ I\u2019m talking about tea; a beverage that can incite political uprising or showcase\
  \ an art form. The latter of which I have always been more fascinated by. But not\
  \ having yet traveled to Asia, I haven\u2019t really experienced genuine \u201C\
  way of tea.\u201D That is until I went to Ljubljana, Slovenia. \nCha \u010Cajna\
  \ Hi\u0161a, is a small tea house occupying a space that was once a chapel, according\
  \ to long-time waiter Edi \u2013 information I find plausible from the faded frescos\
  \ on the ceiling. Cha is nestled in a hundred-year-old white-wash building in the\
  \ Old Town section of the capitol. During summer, this pedestrian street of small\
  \ shops and cafes is dotted with outdoor seating, linen umbrellas, and throw pillows\
  \ for comfort. Cha is no different. The only difference is that its pillows are\
  \ red. \nSitting outside under the linen shade, a glimpse at the menu shows a vast\
  \ variety of exotic Chinese, Japanese, and Taiwanese tea. For an amateur tea aficionado\
  \ as myself, I go for the most exotic thing I can find \u2013 the Japanese green\
  \ tea Gyokuro Asahi. According to my waiter, because it only grows in the shade\
  \ in the Uji region of Japan and is hand-picked once a year (read rare and difficult),\
  \ it\u2019s mostly consumed for special occasions. \nI could tell. Out it came on\
  \ a dark oak tray, with two small ceramic cups, a tea timer, and a small thermos.\
  \ Wait a minute, that last item threw me off. But I find out the thermos is designed\
  \ to ensure that the water stays at the perfect 70\u02DAC temperature to not make\
  \ the Gyokuro too bitter or not flavorful enough. The thermos makes sense now.\n\
  The first 90-second steep is discarded and done to \u201Cwash the leaves.\u201D\
  \ The second two-minute steep is the one I can start enjoying. The tea is earthy,\
  \ fresh, a bit bitter, but still very delicate. Each subsequent steeping (which\
  \ can be done up to five times) gives off a different flavor profile. One is stronger\
  \ and more bitter, the other milder and grassy. \nAfter five steepings (and trust\
  \ me I could keep going), I felt relaxed yet alert. In part due to the fact that\
  \ Gyokuro has high levels of L-Theanine, an amino acid known to promote \u201Crelaxation\
  \ without sedation,\u201D according to Google.\nBut that\u2019s how I felt; relaxed\
  \ and in awe. Experiencing the Japanese way of tea on the streets of Ljubljana,\
  \ sans thermos."
