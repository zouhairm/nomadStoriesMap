Text: "The place was legendary, the road was very small and the trees covered up the\
  \ roofs of the taxi\u2019s that lay ahead. As far as you can look you would see\
  \ yellow 7 seat cars parked on both sides. Men stood in groups and talked loudly,\
  \ most laughed or argued. many drivers stood by their taxis waiting for any customer.\n\
  As I walked down the famous \u201Cbab ouahran\u201D street in Tlemcen, the one with\
  \ taxis to all destination, I found myself fascinated at the classic unhindered\
  \ sweet looks, smells and feels of this city. I hurried and picked up my phone \u201C\
  click, click \u201C.\nMy friends and I walked down the street looking completely\
  \ strange then, we approached the first group of drivers to ask for directions.\n\
  \u201CAlgiers? Oh yes sure, come with me!\u201D. The old man leads the way, then\
  \ he moves forward to stop by an old \u201CVW\u201D painted faded yellow with a\
  \ fairly young driver who is ecstatic for having received 3 customers all at once.\
  \ \nAs we waited and tried to calm down the driver and convince him to wait a bit\
  \ longer, the nice old man comes up to me again with a worried look o his face:\
  \ \u201C Benti, why did you take a picture of me earlier?\u201D. I was taken aback.\
  \ Well, yes I did, but he wasn\u2019t exactly what I was aiming for. Actually, he\
  \ was only a part of it. Should I tell the truth? oh well, it might work\u2026\n\
  \u201CI was so surprised at the beauty of this place; I wanted to take a pic to\
  \ show my family \u2013throw in a little joke- brag a little about the beauty of\
  \ Tlemcen\u201D\nI stop to get a feel of the situation, the man was still suspicious\
  \ and my friends were starting to come closer to me in a sort of defensive worried\
  \ manner.\nNo! I must find a way out! What could I say to this man that could stop\
  \ the tension building in the air?\nI took a long look at him, his eyes, face, turbine\
  \ and it came to me. I smiled said:\u201D ih tani 3la khater rak mnawer 3amo \u201C\
  \ ( which means:\u201D also because you\u2019re looking very enlightened Sir\u201D\
  \ in Algeria we use this word as a compliment to the soul of the person ) and he\
  \ smiled showing all his teeth and my friends turned to me with an amused glance.\
  \ he giggled a bit and said: \u201Cwell if that is the case then, by all means,\
  \ benti, take another and post it on your internet\u201D.I laughed.\nThe taxi drove\
  \ off and the smiling old man waved us goodbye as another taxi driver hailed \u201C\
  beslama\u201D to us\u2026 we drove off to leave Tlemcen and come home. The smiling\
  \ old man\u2019s image, now that I look back, was the perfect goodbye hug to me\
  \ from al jawhara."
