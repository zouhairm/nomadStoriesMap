Text: "The day before I had tasted trout capraccio, a typical plate from Yunnan, but\
  \ eating raw fish around there had not been a brilliant idea.\nIn the grip of diarrhea,\
  \ that Sunday I headed toward the market. There was a lot of ferment: Nuxi women\
  \ were selling toasted peanuts in straw baskets, black mushrooms like gastropods\
  \ fossils, toads and giant carps from the Yangtze River.\nI penetrated through the\
  \ butcher shops: a heap of meats hanged to rusted hooks. Blood smell nauseated me,\
  \ but I forced myself to proceed toward the cattle section. Chickens and turtles\
  \ doves were slaughtered and plucked at the moment, and their bowels were spread\
  \ everywhere on the floor. It stank of fear and death. Poultry slapped constantly.\
  \ Dogs, instead, were quiet in their cages. A black dog whined, with the tail between\
  \ its legs, but I took a picture of it and I went away.\nMy stomach was boiling\
  \ over; I felt awful. Eating a bite could help me, I thought, so I entered into\
  \ the canteen. I had a seat between sellers\u2019 looks who were having lunch, serving\
  \ themselves rice, smoking and drinking tea. A guy, as soon as he finished to eat,\
  \ took his dentures off and he cleaned it up with a cloth hanky. I ate boiled potatoes\
  \ with cilantro, the easiest food I was able to order and I kept meandering through\
  \ the markets streets. \nOutside, there was this old man, in the middle of fruits\
  \ benches; was he looking at me? I moved closer and I found out he was selling roots\
  \ and medicinal herbs. His goods were organized on a trailer in small bags like\
  \ candies. I mimed the stomach ache looking for a cure. He nodded as he perfectly\
  \ knew what I meant. He indicated the snowy mountains, behind me, and I almost visualized\
  \ him hiking up there and collecting flowers and roots in an unreal silence. \n\
  The old man gave to me some pieces of wood, wrapped in a newspaper page. I asked\
  \ him instructions; maybe he could write something down for me and I took a pen\
  \ from my backpack, but he laughed showily: the old man had no tooth and could not\
  \ write. \nAs soon as I handed off the money, he rushed in a tavern to have lunch.\
  \ The morning was disappearing and a blue wind started to blow down from the Tibetan\
  \ mountains. Now I had just to look for hot water to make the old man\u2019s intestinal\
  \ remedy."
