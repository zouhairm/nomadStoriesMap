Text: "This was in 2015, April  when i visited Rishikesh in India. We were a group\
  \ of 6 people. The tour was to do a camping in Rishikesh. The night we reached,\
  \ it started to rain. April and rains are coincidence, but it was like a welcome\
  \ treat by the nature, \nOur camp was down near the river and we were 500 m above\
  \ the camping location. Getting down there was a task because it wasn't a concrete\
  \ road plus the rain. With the help we somehow  managed  our way out.\nThat night\
  \ freeezing, we just ate our dinner and as there was not electricity i decided \
  \ to go to bed.\nAs the next day would be an early rise \n\nThat morning  was really\
  \ the morning everyone should get up to.\nGot freshen up and i went walking towards\
  \ the river. I sat there for 30 mins, just letting  the cold aqua color water run\
  \ through my feet.\nThe sun was rising and i could see two young black furry dogs\
  \ running together, playing with each other in the sand, rolling from far away with\
  \ two young girls, teenagers maybe, walking behind them. 1st thought for them was\
  \ probably sisters or friends.\nI couldnt stop myself from getting up and walking\
  \ towards them, wantedplaying with those cute little friendly pups \nThose two girl\
  \ came and stood next to me out of curiosity. Giggling with the sweetest smile.\n\
  I asked them, are these your pet dogs, they said yes, his name is Sheru and Sheppa.\n\
  I asked -  Are you two real sisters? they said no we are friends weare neighbours.\n\
  I asked them would guys like to eat some nuts, they said no at first then out of\
  \ suprise one said yes. I gave them all. These nuts was my morning breakfast. I\
  \ asked what is your name? She said Rua and hers is Kriti.\nI assumed Kriti was\
  \ the shy one.\nWhere are you guys going heading.\nRua - we need wood to cook\n\
  So our mother everyday would ask to take these dogs and get some wooden logs.\n\
  I asked do you like getting up so early. They said yes we get more time to play.\n\
  Kriti wanted to go, so Rua asked we would leave. I said can i join you i would like\
  \ to help you too and dont worry im like a elder sister to you, my name is Kajal,\
  \ i am here to visit Rishikesh. They happily took me to the place from where they\
  \ get wooden logs.\nCollecting those logs i realised life is so simple and beautiful\
  \ we just need someone beside us, something to work on and somewhere on this earth\
  \ to live.\nThose two girls had all, a friend to accompany, dogs too! Had a moto\
  \ for collecting some logs and a beautiful morning  to get up everyday for, peaceful\
  \ night with million of star to stare."
