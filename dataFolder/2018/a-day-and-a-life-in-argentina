Text: The day and a life in Argentina will be an epic travel adventure story that
  will dive head first into the life and local way of living in Argentina and what
  their local and national traditions mean to them, while embracing and making some
  local connections in each city, town or village that I get to visit on the trip.
  This process would involve learning some of the local language, interviewing some
  local people and general documentation about what it is like to not only be born
  in Argentina, but how the local people have grown up, live and still practice all
  of the local and national traditions of the country. Eating and trying as much of
  the fresh local produce and traditional cuisines that I can find will be a high
  priority, while learning about how they grow and harvest their own produce within
  the countries climate, what ingredients they have used in each of these traditional
  local meals and how they are prepared, cooked and then served. My travel story would
  also heavily revolve around the local history, the historical factors and foundations
  of the country, the architecture in each region and the local transportations. Last
  but not least I would also be seeking to visit some of the beautiful natural wonders,
  surrounding landscapes, and experience some of the different flora and fauna that
  Argentina as a whole has to offer.
