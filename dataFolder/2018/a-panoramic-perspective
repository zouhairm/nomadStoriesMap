Text: "\u2018What sort of plants are they?\u2019 I asked, pointing.\n\_\_ \_\u2018\
  Quinoa,\u2019 my friend said.\n\_\_ \_\u2018Quinoa?\u2019 I laughed. \u2018The superfood?\u2019\
  \n\_\_ \_I regularly ate quinoa back in Australia. It was a superfood. People said\
  \ the phrase in the tone of a whisper. Nobody really knew what a superfood was,\
  \ and perhaps if you were oblivious to the abundance of it in a ditch in Ecuador,\
  \ it could serve as a symbol for endless possibilities.\n\_\_ \_\u2018Well, here\
  \ it\u2019s a weed,\u2019 she shrugged.\n\_\_ It was a funny thing to consider.\
  \ One culture\u2019s superfood was another country\u2019s weed. \n\_\_ \_We had\
  \ decided to go bungee jumping. It was something I\u2019d always wanted to do, but\
  \ now wasn\u2019t so sure. My heart still stung with third-world images, and the\
  \ fact that the jump was only twenty dollars was starting to bother me.\n\_\_ \_\
  \u2018You did what?\u2019 I could hear my mother shriek.\n\_\_ \_Still, pride took\
  \ over and I insisted on going first. \n\_\_ \_The man spoke little English, but\
  \ did his best Spanglish. Strapping me into a harness, he motioned for me to walk\
  \ the plank, and I stepped over the safety rails.\n\_\_ \_Nothing had prepared me\
  \ for this moment. My legs froze as I saw the valley below. The frigid air whipped\
  \ around my claro hair that marks me as a gringa, a foreigner, and I trembled.\n\
  \_\_ \_\u2018I\u2019ll count you down,\u2019 sang the instructor. \n\_\_ \_I had\
  \ heard once that if you didn\u2019t jump when told, you never would. People spent\
  \ their lives on a ledge, too afraid to leave safety. For the first time I was afraid\
  \ I couldn\u2019t jump. I considered turning back when he yelled.\n\_\_ \_\u2018\
  Despacio!\u2019\n\_\_ \_And so I stood on the bridge and took my time, just as I\
  \ was told to, despite the rush to either turn back or fall into the abyss. I thought\
  \ about the papery twenty-dollar bill I had handed over, and how for me this was\
  \ a cheap experience, a sign of privilege. I thought about how my legs had locked\
  \ at the sight of the valley below.\n\_\_\_I thought about the adrenaline cursing\
  \ through my veins.\nAnd somewhere between the mountains, the valley, and the unpolluted\
  \ sky, I found myself and took the leap. I can remember little from the jump, just\
  \ a blur, the sky and the valley transversing into one, and then a feeling of bliss.\
  \ \nAnd there I was, at the end of my literal tether, full of emotions, when I realised:\n\
  This was travelling; this was growing up. This was taking the good with the bad.\
  \ \nThis was learning not to ignore other societies' norms, and how to question\
  \ your own. \nThis was about pushing yourself to the edge, in every sense of the\
  \ word."
