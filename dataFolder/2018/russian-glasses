Text: "\u201CPlease, next one\u201D said the police officer at the desk.\nI approached\
  \ to the point that he showed me, and I stayed there. Stood, waiting.\n\u201CPaspart\u201D\
  \ said the man, staring at me.\nI gave him my document. \nWhile he was looking and\
  \ checking that everything was fine, I was wondering about his name, his life and\
  \ his job. He has seen thousands of men and woman, of every age and nationality.\
  \ That was his job, checking their passports. How fascinating that should have been\
  \ seeing passport of different colours with different visas, symbols, stamps, alphabets,\
  \ languages\u2026\n\u201C\u043E\u0447\u043A\u0438?\u201D\n\u201C\u2026\u201D\n\u201C\
  \u041E\u0427\u041A\u0418!\u201D said, raising his voice and calling my attention.\n\
  I looked at him and looked at the desk, and again, looked him. \nI was a scared.\
  \ \nHe was trying to tell me something in Russian. I don\u2019t speak a single word\
  \ of Russian, but then he pointed at my face and then showed me my passport\u2019\
  s photo, but still, I didn\u2019t get it.\n He repeated one more time the word,\
  \ and another time in a struggling English, \n\u201CGlassez\u201D\nStupid me, of\
  \ course, I don\u2019t wear my glasses so often now, but I had a pair in my bag,\
  \ for every chance. I wore them and they let me go, checking me one more time. \n\
  I was entering  in Saint Petersburg, in the Russian Federation, for the first time\
  \ in my life.\n-\nI had to spend 5 days in the town, but the first thing that I\
  \ wanted to see was the re-built Amber Room, it was one of the most astonishing\
  \ thing in the world.\nI decided to go there all by myself. I decided to have my\
  \ own personal adventure. So I searched on Google how to reach the train station\
  \ and I began to walk. After five minute I was lost and I didn\u2019t know where\
  \ to go or how to return back. I tried to ask to somebody to help me, but nobody\
  \ seemed to understand me. Then a girl stopped, hearing that I was direct to Pushkin,\
  \ a city nearby, where the palace is and also her hometown.\n\u201CMasha\u201D she\
  \ says, waving her hand, and continues \u201CI can help you, I am returning back\
  \ home\u201D\n\u201CNice to meet you, Masha. I\u2019m Joel\u201D. \u201CI really\
  \ need your help, I don\u2019t understand a word, everything is in Cyrillic!\u201D\
  \n\u201CAhaha I know. I\u2019ll help you\u201D\n\u201COh, thank you\u201D I say\n\
  We start walking I made question and Masha answers smiling. \nWe arrived at the\
  \ station and everything from the timetable to the ATM was fascinating. We get into\
  \ the train. It was simple, the seat wasn\u2019t the best and it was a bit cold\
  \ even if it was April, but I was happy. I always dreamt this moment. I was ready\
  \ to begin my adventure!"
