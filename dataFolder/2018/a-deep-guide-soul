Text: "I have always traveled and I have always loved doing it. Since I was little\
  \ I have traveled with my family. Especially in summer, trips of around a month\
  \ and in Europe. First with a trailer and since I was 10 in a motor home. It was\
  \ not until I was older that we left Europe. It was on the Indonesia trip that I\
  \ had a connection with a local that I had never had before.\n\nThat summer, when\
  \ I was 18, we traveled to Asia for the first time. We arrived to Borneo. It was\
  \ completely green. Wild nature and jungle in every corner. Friendly people with\
  \ whom I learnt something new in each conversation. The following days we would\
  \ be traveling in a klotok, a slow boat with which we would go up the river to discover\
  \ the island from the beaches to the inside.  \n\nThe guide introduced himself as\
  \ Isai. He was a young boy, dressed in military style, wearing a machete in his\
  \ belt and with some cuts on his arm and face. Although he did not tell us his age,\
  \ he was young and could not have been more than 28 years old. During the first\
  \ hours the communication was scarce, but we got confidence very fast. He explained\
  \ that he was a native of Borneo. He was born in a village in the inside of the\
  \ island, in the middle of the jungle, where his family continued living. He had\
  \ been working as a guide for the last 2 years, and he really enjoyed it because\
  \ it was a job that allowed him to earn money and be in contact with nature.\n\n\
  The talks got longer and the confidence grew quickly. Isai had a complete knowledge\
  \ of the jungle. Animals, plants, hidden places, local histories and food. He was\
  \ not afraid of anything but he was always watching, telling us different stories\
  \ or showing something new to us.\n\nBut there was a day when I considered Isai\
  \ as my friend. It was the day he told us about his past. Isai wore military attire,\
  \ carried a machete and knew how to move very well. He confessed that in another\
  \ life, not many years ago, he had been an army soldier. He remembered it as a difficult\
  \ time, one he was not ashamed of but perhaps he would not have liked to be a part\
  \ of. He told us that he had learned, and that he had lost a lot. He never spoke\
  \ about this again, but the naturalness with which he explained it and the trust\
  \ he placed in us made Isai much more than a guide.\n\nIsai's dream was to open\
  \ a route in full nature in the interior of the island. More adventure and few amenities.\
  \ I am waiting for the day he confirms he has already opened it for returning to\
  \ Borneo and pay him a visit."
