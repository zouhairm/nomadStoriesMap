Text: "I am a dog person. Always have been. \xBFDid I ever loved a cat? Once, years\
  \ ago. His name was Fluffy. He passed away. Poor little angel\u2026\nI think about\
  \ him, my yellow-eyed dead friend, while I walk the streets of Jaffa. This ancient\
  \ city embraces me, at his/her own way: rude taxi drivers, straight-to-the-point\
  \ minded locals\u2026 And cats. Everywhere. They rule this city, and stare at me\
  \ when I take a minute to make a good photo. \u201CWhat are you doing here?\u201D\
  , they seem to ask. \u201CWhere are you from, you dark-bearded man?\u201D. One of\
  \ them, the biggest, is black and white, and his eyes have the color of the same\
  \ sun that burns me. He looks like Fluffy, somehow. He looks like the boss, the\
  \ tough guy that protects this neighborhood. Is waiting for me to give them an answer.\n\
  \u201CI am from Spain\u2026 I am a good guy, I promise\u201D I say. \u201COh! And\
  \ I love cats, of course\u201D.\nThe tough cat seems to analyze me. He jumps from\
  \ the bench (from where he guide his people) and smell my pants, my sandals.\n\u201C\
  Ok, spaniard. You can pass\u201D.\nThis is the spirit of Jaffa: I don\u2019t connect\
  \ with the locals, I don\u2019t know why, maybe it\u2019s my mistake. But cats have\
  \ magic souls, and they respect me. At their own way, of course. This place is painted\
  \ by a wounderful color made of silence, ages, meowings.\nIf I walk to the top of\
  \ the hill I\u2019ll see the skycratchers of Tel Aviv, the enormous beaches, the\
  \ long roads crossing the city\u2026 But I won\u2019t do it. I\u2019ll stay here,\
  \ in Jaffa, in other time, with my new fellowship.\nThe cats respects me, but don\u2019\
  t trust me: where I go, they come with me: I hear their meowings, their wise voices,\
  \ when I photograph the Theatre of Jaffa. I see their eyes in the bushes when I\
  \ look at the Ramses gate. If I buy a bottle of water, they are next to me, keeping\
  \ an eye. If I eat a slice of pita bread, they watch over, and expect me to give\
  \ them a piece, to pay my tax.\nWhen the sun goes by, the tough cat finds me in\
  \ the wishing bridge:\n\u201COk, spaniard. You can now wish something, but then\
  \ you need to go\u201D.\n\u201CWhy?\u201D, I ask. \u201CI thought we were friends!\u201D\
  .\n\u201CThe night in Jaffa is ancient, we need to respect it. We can\u2019t protect\
  \ you when the sun is not watching\u2026 Now go, spaniard\u201D.\nI leave the city,\
  \ slowly, waiting for a cat to tell me that I can stay. But they don\u2019t come.\
  \ Any of them. This town is as beautiful as ruthless, as bright as dark. I leave\
  \ it with mi pride hurt, but deeply in love. The old stones, the dock, the food,\
  \ the salad smell of the Mediterranean\u2026 and them; my mustachioed fellowship."
