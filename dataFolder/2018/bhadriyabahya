Text: There he was cross legged and sat on the ground, clothed in his light linen
  trousers and shirt. He was constantly in a mode of either being busy or taking rest.
  Even though there was a bed available he chose to curl up on the floor. This morning,
  however, he was splitting green gram, and his experienced and nimble fingers were
  making easy work of this time consuming task. She sat beside him on the tiled floor,
  despite the protest of others, and tried to help. He smiled and gently moved his
  head as he spoke, and even though he uttered another language he managed to tell
  her, in animated stories, about the monkeys who had been in the trees outside the
  apartment. They went for a walk some days later in search of water and some batteries
  for a scientific instrument she had brought along. They seemed to communicate intuitively
  in their own languages, but still understood one another. They walked a dusty street
  that was teeming with scooters, sometimes laden with a whole family. The people
  were dressed in beautifully bright clothes and had broad and welcoming smiles to
  match. Once they had retrieved their supplies they headed back down a side street
  lined with white buildings offset by the colour of tropical flowers. Upon reaching
  the apartment she had to leave and travel to the banana plantations and carry out
  trials. She was sad to leave. She knew she would never forget him and his genuine
  nature. She found it heartbreaking that he did all this work for his family and
  could only see them once a year.
