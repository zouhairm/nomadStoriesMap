Text: "So all this happened in the month of August. I was supposed to go to an Indian\
  \ wedding of my cousin. We had booked our tickets pretty early as we didn't want\
  \ to land in trouble of shortage of tickets. I and my family of four reached the\
  \ Coimbatore station wherein our relatives had picked us up. We then went to a nearby\
  \ resort where the mehendi (henna) festival was conducted. \n\nIt was such a delightful\
  \ and breezy experience. All the people from the bride and groom family had arranged\
  \ buses to go to Ootacamund which was the actual destination of the wedding. \n\
  It was 5pm that we left from Coimbatore and we reached around 9pm at Ootacamund.\
  \ The area we stayed was at the topmost peak of all other resorts there.\nSo naturally\
  \ it was quite cold and foggy.\n\nThe next day was the engagement day whose atmosphere\
  \ was covered with romantic songs  disco lights. Everyone say sat around th bonfire\
  \ and sang songs which made the feeling more enthralling.\n\nThe final day was the\
  \ actual wedding wherein the bride and groom chant sacred lines and take pheras\
  \ to remain together faithfully for seven lives. Amidst the splendid beauty of fog,\
  \ the wedding took place with everyone's presence. I would say this was one of the\
  \ best trip ever because not only could I know about the big fat Indian wedding\
  \ but also I got to admire the nature's beauty in a beautiful and blissful manner."
