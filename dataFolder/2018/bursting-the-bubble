Text: "It was 2AM in Madrid. Emerging groggily from the subway, toting only a small\
  \ backpack, I had one objective in mind: bed. Unfortunately, this was in an apartment\
  \ I\u2019d never been to, with a family I\u2019d met only twelve hours prior. I\
  \ didn't bother reaching for my phone; the faulty battery had fizzled out hours\
  \ ago. But, I was not worried. I had a map!\n\nWell, I had Carlos\u2019 poor excuse\
  \ for a map. His untidy scrawl made reading difficult in the dim street light. Carlos\
  \ was also clearly a minimalist. He had settled for symbols and suggestive spacing,\
  \ with the word \u201Cescuela\u201D floating lazily on the page. The only comfort\
  \ I found was in the address and phone number etched in the right-hand corner. \n\
  \nDetermined to get somewhere, I wandered about. I ambled down curved roads, crossed\
  \ highways, and strolled awkwardly through gas stations. I even spotted a sign saying\
  \ \u201Cescuela\u201D and ventured on, encouraged. But the further I walked, the\
  \ more uneasy I felt. I had no other landmarks. \n\nMy mind attempted positive reinforcement,\
  \ drawing upon the day for motivation. I\u2019d traveled alone to a new city, celebrated\
  \ World Pride with thousands of people, and danced with strangers! I\u2019d even\
  \ legally drunken a mojito (at 18, for Americans, this is exciting). \n\nBut I\u2019\
  d also gotten my period during the parade, run to the nearest bar, and desperately\
  \ used a bathroom without doors. When I\u2019d eaten dinner, I\u2019d forgotten\
  \ how to ask for the check. I was unprepared and clueless. And now I was lost. So\
  \ much for positive reinforcement. \n\nThe empty streets dripped dark orange shadow.\
  \ I felt sick, my stomach churning over the mojito from earlier. Glancing around\
  \ nervously, I tried looking for help. I spotted a man waiting at a bus stop, a\
  \ couple, a mother and a stroller. I knew how to ask for a phone, toyed with the\
  \ words in my head, but my throat closed with each passerby. After almost an hour\
  \ of walking, I turned around, face burning with shame, and dragged myself back\
  \ to the station. \n\nAnd then I was saved! by a group of women, exiting a bar.\
  \ I mustered up the courage and finally spilled out my predicament while they listened,\
  \ sighing sympathetically. After showing them the phone number, someone called Carlos.\
  \ As he arrived, I watched as each woman said goodbye, giving everyone two kisses.\
  \ At first, I thought it was funny; it took impractically long. But I realized,\
  \ had I taken a portion of the time they took in saying goodbye, to say hello, this\
  \ night would have been a lot easier."
