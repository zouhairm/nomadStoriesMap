Text: "At the time of the story I am about to tell, I was still a student completing\
  \ a six-month elective in Melbourne. Towards the end of my stay a friend suggested\
  \ I visit Bali and as I searched for flights, an alternative arose that included\
  \ a stop in Dili prior to a flight to Dempassar. Remembering an acquaintance I had\
  \ in the city, I decided to stay for a few days and explore East Timor.\nThe airport\
  \ in Dili was a single building, small and discrete, with only two metal detectors\
  \ and a few border control officers awaiting our arrival. It was hot and humid.\
  \ My ride was waiting for me, a young school teacher who had come all the way to\
  \ Dili to teach physical education at the Australian school. She was in her early\
  \ 30\u2019s, tanned and smiling at me as if she knew me intimately. As we drove\
  \ home, I was astonished by the poverty in sight. The houses were mere shacks made\
  \ out of sheets of metal, few roads were tarred and the motorcycles that somehow\
  \ carried five plus bags scurried about at a frenzied pace. \nThe next few days\
  \ were spent discovering the natural treasures that the island held. I had heard\
  \ about the coral reefs on the island of Atauro and after a short training session,\
  \ I participated in my first dive. How can I describe countless colours and life\
  \ forms speeding to and fro from the reef? Floating in an expanse of water, a mere\
  \ voyeur of nature, I felt at once both a member and an intruder in this scene of\
  \ idyllic existence. Looking back, I remember feeling connected to something that\
  \ was beyond my comprehension; the origin of it all, the purpose. Questions I had\
  \ never posed before to be frank, issues I was afraid to discuss in the fear of\
  \ being misunderstood. How do you talk about life and death without bringing religion\
  \ into the mix and getting lost in the classification of beliefs? From the artifice\
  \ that is set up around faith to the fanaticism that dilutes the true meaning of\
  \ the word, there is a lot to be discussed. Suffice it to say that the experience\
  \ of East Timor, the simplicity of its people, the unsuspecting openness with which\
  \ I was received, and the true contentment I witnessed even among the very poor,\
  \ was to me a greater testament to the true nature of humanity and the existence\
  \ of God than all the years I have spent in catechism. Amidst all this, after reading\
  \ the themes I was to follow, I realized that the local connection I made was with\
  \ myself, in a mystical place where paucity allows for humility and happiness in\
  \ the simplicity of life."
