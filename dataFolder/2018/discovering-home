Text: "When I visited New Zealand for the first time I was emerging from a dark segment\
  \ of my life. My closest and most supportive friend, who also was a major Tolkien\
  \ fan, accompanied me. We approached the trip fervently; sketching every detail\
  \ of our itinerary together. As we planned, I sheltered a dimming hope that I might\
  \ acquire something more purposeful through our adventure.\nIt became clear to me\
  \ throughout our journey, that my friend and I were taking different meanings from\
  \ our experiences. Hobbiton was delightful for her because it was an opportunity\
  \ to be a be absorbed by hobbit-fueled nostalgia. The colorful hobbit houses draped\
  \ with intricately designed artificial foliage created an immersive experience that\
  \ my friend treasured. In contrast, the height of my enjoyment came afterward. Witnessing\
  \ our bus driver belt out the words to \u201CShe\u2019ll Be Coming \u2018Round the\
  \ Mountain\u201D while racing around the roundabouts fostered a moment comradery\
  \ that I found inviting. Our heads rushed with dizziness, but we all sang along\
  \ with the loud enthusiasm of a bus of school children. My friend reveled in the\
  \ photo opportunities of our portraits framed with backdrops of the unspoiled lakes\
  \ lying beneath the Southern Alps, which were perfectly capped with snow. Instead,\
  \ I valued the night of nonstop laughter obtained from the company of two elder\
  \ men who challenged us to a game of darts at Mount Cook\u2019s pub. Our darts often\
  \ ended up on the floor rather than the board, but the gentlemen never failed to\
  \ cheer loudly for us; shouting positive encouragement flavored with colorful obscenities.\
  \ I felt a resonance with the people I met in New Zealand which I seldom encountered\
  \ elsewhere, a peace that enabled me to envisage an opportunity for change. \nI\
  \ had long yearned for that peaceful feeling it seemed everyone else had and it\
  \ was a new experience in my life. My friend had seen my determination to find meaning\
  \ from my turbulent past. She was the friend who had shown me support when I struggled\
  \ to reclaim my life, and I knew she would understand why I needed to start anew\
  \ in an uplifting environment. We had traveled from Auckland to Queenstown, and\
  \ my noisy mind was finally unburdened. The decision was obvious to me. I knew the\
  \ future distance between my friend and I would always be difficult, but I also\
  \ knew she would selflessly embolden me to go."
