Text: "Peyote Way is a religious organization based in Wilcox, AZ. This is where I\
  \ found Rev Anne and Rabbi Matt, the caretakers of a secluded piece of land home\
  \ to coyotes, horses, hummingbirds and the transitory spiritual types. Like most\
  \ authentically spiritual retreats, the road leading to the Peyote Way Church of\
  \ God isn\u2019t paved, it\u2019s barely drivable, and you\u2019re constantly looking\
  \ over your shoulder, thinking, \"Is this the way?\" \nPeyote is a cactus, and when\
  \ ingested, a teacher. The spirit walk is a three-day process. The first day is\
  \ for fasting and acclimating yourself to the land. The fasting is meant to keep\
  \ your stomach clean and empty so that you don\u2019t throw up the medicine. The\
  \ second day, around sunset, you ingest Peyote by sipping it every twenty minutes\
  \ and keep a campfire going until it\u2019s finished with you. There are a few different\
  \ campsites with canopies and fire pits to choose from. I chose the one furthest\
  \ from the house. It was far enough away that I needed to be dropped off in Matt\u2019\
  s hotwired and door-less truck. The third day is to slowly get your shit together.\
  \ \nMy spirit walk, auspiciously, was on Halloween night.\nI kept a journal, but\
  \ once I came back to reality, all I had was a few pages of bold-lettered bumper-sticker\
  \ phrases like, Time Is Not Finite. The essence of the teaching was in the experience.\
  \ It\u2019s in the way nature responded and reflected back at me. Peyote removed\
  \ the blinders, and I was present as an extension of the cosmos. If I hadn\u2019\
  t come prepared with questions, I might\u2019ve been shown more. I was seeking to\
  \ know why I couldn\u2019t be happy? Why did I feel empty in my day to day life?\
  \ What am I supposed to do?\nI was gazing into my campfire when I noticed a stick\
  \ bug climbing the mound of dirt and reaching for the fire. It would touch the flame\
  \ with one of its legs, recoil, then roll down the mound. When it regained its footing,\
  \ it would start back up towards the light. Thinking compassionately, I stood up\
  \ to save the insect from itself, but once I stood, I heard a presence sternly say,\
  \ \u201CSit down.\u201D I sat down and watched this stick bug continue to make the\
  \ same journey, burning itself a little more each trip. Consciously, I was no longer\
  \ just in my body. I was still Robert, from California, but I was also that stick\
  \ bug. I was seeing through the eyes of Peyote. Then, as the insect met its demise,\
  \ my lesson was over. I experienced that I was the insect that reaches for the fire,\
  \ and I was the fire."
