Text: "Going to Africa was an aspiration since childhood. Watching the Lion King and\
  \ reading about the savannas and jungles in National Geographic made me want to\
  \ experience them in the flesh. My dream was fulfilled in 2014. That summer I went\
  \ on a five week college trip with five other students to Tanzania. For the first\
  \ few days we were in Dar es Salaam, but the lion's share was spent at a convent\
  \ in the countryside. Many of the Nuns got their degrees from our college, which\
  \ is also a Benedictine institution. The convent buildings are made of brick, built\
  \ on red dirt and surrounded by palm trees. Pigs , goats, cows, and donkeys are\
  \ fenced while chickens roam free.\n Our goal was not only to strengthen the relationship\
  \ between our school and the convent, but to live immersed in another culture and\
  \ way of life. Each day was lived as the Nuns lived, we all worked at different\
  \ section of the convent beside them. Some of the students volunteered at the orphanage\
  \ or the library, I worked in primarily in the bakery. With the Nuns I learned to\
  \ make bread, noodles, cookies, donuts, and cake. I got to know some of them well,\
  \ they were eager to practice their English.\n When I wasn't baking I usually led\
  \ reading lessons at the library. I taught the kids from the orphanage as well as\
  \ schoolchildren from the local villages. The library was old and most of the books\
  \ were donated by American and British churches. The kids asked me many questions\
  \ about my life back home, and I made sure to ask them about what they did in their\
  \ free time.\n One of the orphans was rather fond of me. Her face lit up whenever\
  \ she saw me and she would follow me around, asking questions with her limited English.\
  \ On our last full day at the convent she gave me her favorite toy when we were\
  \ saying our goodbyes. I felt guilty, but accepted it out of courtesy. It was a\
  \ large chunk of Styrofoam tied to a long strand of dental floss. When she wasn't\
  \ looking I set it down, they needed it more than me. I was reminded of the widow\
  \ in the Mark's Gospel who gave tithed two coins to the Temple, led Jesus to declare\
  \ she donated more than anyone else. \n The Nuns and the kids at the orphanage don't\
  \ have many possessions, but they are a close-knit community where everyone is valued\
  \ and equal. Interacting with them taught me to stop dwelling I the things I don't\
  \ have, and to be more grateful for the things I do have.\n \u201COne day I will\
  \ have the right words, and they will be simple\u201D \u2013 Jack Kerouac"
