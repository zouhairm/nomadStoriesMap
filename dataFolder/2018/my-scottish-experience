Text: "No more than a whim of a decision, two friends, a tent and a so-called plan\
  \ accompanied me on travels around Scotland. Day one and at least a dozen Scottish\
  \ stereotypes were ticked off my list as soon as we stepped so far as a few feet\
  \ in Edinburgh. Men in kilts playing bagpipes accompanying every turn we took, disjunct\
  \ notes chaperoning us through the streets. A bustle of comedians clogging the pavements,\
  \ hurried locals dividing tour guides\u2019 captive audiences and street performers\
  \ galore, it was Fringe Festival season. \n\nSeveral days later, we set off to explore\
  \ Scotland\u2019s wild side, or at least we tried to. An accident on the only road\
  \ leading to Loch Lomond resulted in a complete closure of the road. No way for\
  \ us to get there. After the countless hours spent waiting to hear whether the normal\
  \ bus service would resume, we decided to take the matter into our own hands, and\
  \ take a train to the nearest loch instead. The bustle of busy Glasgow city was\
  \ soon a distant memory, as the train sped along the tracks off into the mountains.\
  \ When we finally arrived at our destination, we were greeted by the most spectacular\
  \ sunset. The sun was slowly sinking beneath the cumbersome hills, dipping Loch\
  \ Long in the most vibrant shades of red and orange. \n\nThe following day the real\
  \ adventure began. After hitch-hiking our way to Loch Lomond, we took a bus to the\
  \ starting point of our walk on the West Highland Way, an inn in the middle of nowhere.\
  \ Stunning view after stunning view greeted us with each and every step. Once a\
  \ peak was reached, another was just on the horizon. A sense of awe filled me, which\
  \ I\u2019d never quite experienced before. Once we\u2019d hiked a couple of hours,\
  \ the tiredness started kicking in. Every step became a struggle, the heavy hiking\
  \ boots weighing my feet down and the large backpack I was wearing, trying to wrestle\
  \ me to the ground. A battle of the wills started. It was me versus the backpack\
  \ and the boots. Any break we tried to take was sabotaged by midges, which would\
  \ instantly swarm around us and start biting us. Instant relief greeted us, along\
  \ with a sense of accomplishment every time we reached a campsite. It was one more\
  \ day that we\u2019d won the battle against the boots and backpacks. \n\nOur trip\
  \ around Scotland resulted in me facing and completing hurdles I never imagined\
  \ I would and I discovered a great lot about myself. The last thing I expected was\
  \ to come to grips with who I really am and simultaneously fall in love with Scotland."
