Text: 'It was a lazy Sunday morning and I landed in San Lorenzo,a port town in Arjentina.

  With the name Arjentina,two other names come automatically to mind..football and
  steak.

  Here me and my colleague met Philip,our taxi driver cum guide cum forex exchange
  point who would accompany us for the rest of the day and leave us with a reason
  to come back to Arjentina again.


  Philip took us to all the tiny corners of the town and as we ventured into a steakhouse,suggested
  to try out one of his favourite steak.As we were lost in relishing the delicious
  steak,my colleague Sam did not leave the chance to collect the local steak recipe
  for his family dinner surprise dish back at home in Hong Kong.


  After the yummy lunch we came out for enjoying an Arjentinian evening and realised
  how deep the impact of  football is in their lives.

  We watched youth coming to football clubs for practising like we go to coffee shops
  or pubs for a break.Eager to catch  a glimpse of a practice session of a soccer
  training session in an Arjentinian Football club,I dared to almost trespass a club
  and to our surprise got a warm welcome to be a part of the practice session.

  Practising football with the Messis of tomorrow in a picturesque town in Arjentina
  in a Sunday evening is what we carried back home together with the taste of a delicious
  steak and the memory of some super friendly hospitable people.

  Next day as we left Arjentina I left with a heavy heart and a strong desire to come
  back to this mesmerising place at least one more time in life.'
