Text: "A storm was brewing. The house phone had not stopped ringing until I picked\
  \ it up, a recorded French woman\u2019s voice saying something. Storm was coming.\
  \ High storm surge expected. My reaction, perhaps after all those years living in\
  \ Florida by the sea, was to grab the dogs leash and go for a walk. Let\u2019s see\
  \ if there really was a storm coming. Yes, let\u2019s!\nNew Year\u2019s Day, a walk\
  \ with the pooches I was caring for, in lovely Tranche-sur-la Mer in France. Three\
  \ weeks in December and into early January idyllic, caring for two dogs, Mabel and\
  \ Betty, plus a grey tabby for a couple vacationing in the Canary Islands. \nAccess\
  \ to my hosts bicycle in Tranche-sur-la-Mer, I had been enjoying rides to the beach.\
  \ Fascinated, and somewhat horrified when I ran over a long strand of caterpillars.\
  \ I\u2019d been observing how, first they were everywhere in the pine forest, and\
  \ second, they tenaciously held onto one another, creating a string, or chain as\
  \ they traversed the road. \nWalking, our New Year\u2019s Day morning walk, the\
  \ winter wind picking up speed, dogs pulling hard, I spotted a ring of the little\
  \ darling brown fuzzy caterpillars curled up in the middle of the road, just curled\
  \ up in a circle as if hunkering down for the storm. Not going anywhere, they were\
  \ in the middle of the road and would be run over and killed for sure. I paused\
  \ looking down at the innocent ring of caterpillars. \nSearching for a stick, or\
  \ something, anything, to shift the twenty or thirty little caterpillars, I found\
  \ some flat bark. My plan, to gently sweep them onto the bark and get them to safety\
  \ at the side of the road. This plan did not work. Frustrated, as the dogs were\
  \ pulling to continue their walk. I did the expedient thing, picked them up, two\
  \ or three at a time, as they were connected, and gently dropped them at the side\
  \ of the road, confident they would reconnect. Expecting to be pricked, or bitten,\
  \ I was pleasantly surprised. No, it felt soft and well, fuzzy. My goal, to save\
  \ the poor creatures. Successful, I continued and completed my walk with the \u2018\
  beasts\u2019 Mabel and Betty.\nSuddenly the stinging began. It took me several minutes\
  \ to realize that something was wrong and I had the caterpillars to thank. \nGrabbing\
  \ my handy dandy Smartphone, I decided to research these brown caterpillars of Western\
  \ France. Called \u2018processionary caterpillars\u2019 (well, that made sense,\
  \ as they were on a procession whenever I saw them). Words screamed out at me, \u2018\
  Severe Anaphylactic Shock\u2019. Now what was that?"
