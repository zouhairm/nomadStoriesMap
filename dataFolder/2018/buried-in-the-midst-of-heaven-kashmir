Text: "When I think of December, I think of thick snow, lush greens, mulled wine and\
  \ layers and layers of clothing making you feel like a big fat ball. I had always\
  \ dreamt of a white December and it so happened that Kashmir was the chosen city\
  \ for our new years plan.\n\nIt felt I had entered heaven, a heaven I had always\
  \ imagined it to be, So let me take you through my heavenly experience that lasted\
  \ for 5 whimsical days which I highly suggest everyone to go for, especially for\
  \ New Years\n\nHere are a few tips everyone needs tick off the list when in Kashmir:\n\
  \nGet Adventurous: \n\nIf you haven\u2019t skied all your life, now is the time\
  \ to do it. A lot of people say it is a difficult sport, but the minute you get\
  \ a hang of it, you crave for more. Make sure you devote half a day for this particular\
  \ activity and get yourself a personal trainer.\n\nSnow Mobile Under the Stars:\n\
  \nWho said all the activities are done during the day? The best ones are kept for\
  \ the nightriders for an enhanced adventurous journey. My favorite of the lot, was\
  \ snow mobiling amidst snow flaked woods in a mid night blue sky twinkling with\
  \ a million stars. Trust me, It couldn\u2019t get better than this!\n\nDrive through\
  \ Gulmarg on an ATV:\n\nGet your adventurous caps on because Gulmarg offers all\
  \ snow related activities you can possibly thing of. One for the books is to ATV\
  \ through the roads of Gulmarg where they show you everything you need to know about\
  \ Gulmarg. From the strawberry fields to an array of army camps, you shall witness\
  \ full of Gulmarg in an hour and that to in style!\n\nGandola it to Phase 2:\n\n\
  Gandola, in other words cable car, isn\u2019t your ordinary cable car journey, while\
  \ you hop on to this 4 seated trolling car, beneath you in a tone of snow surrounded\
  \ by igloos that is a site you don\u2019t want to miss. The icing to the cake are\
  \ the skiers you shall see drifting away through slopes and risky edges which makes\
  \ you dream of the champ you are when it comes to be a true sport!\n\nAs beautiful\
  \ as you think it can get, there is actually more waiting. Phase 2, the highest\
  \ peak of the mountain is somewhere I can spend 10 days of every month. Snow that\
  \ you can eat like a flavorless gola, sun that sparkles on your face giving you\
  \ the additional warmth and views that are meant for the gods is something that\
  \ you should not miss. Oh Jesus, take make back there right now!\n\nMy Kashmir journey\
  \ was pure bliss and I would go there in a heart beat to experience it all over\
  \ again."
