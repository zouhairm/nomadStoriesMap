Text: "My great, great grandfather, an Iowa farmer, died of constipation. After it\
  \ was much too late, a doctor reached up inside him and pulled out a petrified length\
  \ of the fecal matter that had poisoned him, compacted by his stubbornness. \nThis\
  \ seems like a farmer thing, the stubbornness, I mean, not being full of shit, though\
  \ maybe it\u2019s not so far off, either. Iowa is a land of agriculture \u2013 corn,\
  \ soybeans, hogs. The sewage and fertilizer runoff gets into the waterways, triggering\
  \ boil orders for drinking before traveling down to the Gulf to contribute to toxic\
  \ algae blooms. \nMy father left his own family farm in 1971 to join the Peace Corps\
  \ in Punjab, India. He was placed in a small community and tasked with helping the\
  \ locals learn modern tractor farming. \nAs he assisted in the fields, he saw dozens\
  \ of villagers lined up, watching him. \n\u201CWhat are you doing?\u201D he asked\
  \ them.\n\u201CNothing,\u201D they answered, \u201Cyou\u2019ve taken our jobs.\u201D\
  \nAt this point my father realized that sometimes, humanitarian aid can be full\
  \ of shit. \nIt was my fourteenth day in India, at a small university compound in\
  \ Karnataka. The only word I knew in Kannada, the local language, was \u2018hottay,\u2019\
  \ stomach. I repeated this as I patted mine and gestured to the doctor at the clinic\
  \ where I\u2019d been hurried in a rickshaw as soon as I\u2019d broken down, asked\
  \ for help. I hadn\u2019t pooped in two weeks. I was hungry but also felt full all\
  \ the time. My hottay hurt. \nWhen I returned to the compound with my prescription\
  \ laxatives, dozens of international students and local workers gathered to suggest\
  \ their own home remedies. Everyone was putting bets on the exact time that I\u2019\
  d go to the bathroom then placing new ones when I outlasted them. \nI went to bed\
  \ with no new developments and woke suddenly in the black smear of night with monsoon\
  \ rain syncopating heavily on the roof. I left my cot at a run and dashed across\
  \ the courtyard toward the cement room with squat toilets. There were no lights\
  \ or toilet paper, just a hole in which to navigate the unholy tidal wave that was\
  \ leaving me with impressive force. I used my rain soaked underwear to clean up\
  \ and then walked back to my room in only a T-shirt like a lewd but reborn Porky\
  \ Pig. I made sure to check my watch to so the right person would get the haul of\
  \ rupees in the morning. \nI spent a few more months in India before traveling back\
  \ to Iowa and assuming my place in a long line of folks who have had to become good\
  \ at giving and taking shit lest they become full of it."
