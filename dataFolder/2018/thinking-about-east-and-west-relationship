Text: "I lived and traveled the Eastern Europe and now I living in North America...\
  \ our way of life in Nort America not perfect, but trust it much more better if\
  \ you compared with they way of life... the way I see it we lost second Cold War\
  \ from 1999 to Present and they introduce ideas of failure and greed to our CEO's,\
  \ gov. and other offices of High Power...  \n\ndue to my past work in security field\
  \ I do read books and manuals written by interesting people like J. David Truby\
  \ - https://www.amazon.com/Zips-Pipes-Pens-Arsenal-Improvised/dp/0873647025/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1515368807&sr=8-3&keywords=zip+gun+by+david\
  \ ( I did communicated with this very pleasant author about his book missing chapter\
  \ on military use of Air Gun's by KGB and Arbalets as option used by SAS UK)  Svoya\
  \ razvedka. Prakticheskoe posobie -https://www.amazon.com/Svoya-razvedka-Prakticheskoe-posobie-Author/dp/9851836885\
  \  and few others... anyway in the books/agent manuals and  someone braging about\
  \ Mighty Mother Russia online \n\nI read two things between the lines... 1. using\
  \ someone as agent of change with out even person whom get used knowing or understand\
  \ but you could change whole country and/or economy if you groom this person and\
  \ brainwashed him with ideas/points you want him to think and do... while she doing\
  \ what you want - towards your goals... \n\n2. in 1990's Russian KGB before it become\
  \ FSB did  sponsored research by best and brightest Ph.D's trained in IT, Networking,\
  \ BioTech, Pharma, psychology including A.I. - like BrainMaker System (stolen from\
  \ Johnson & Johnson - Russian division of sales) and other field including A.I.\
  \ plus Russian- Chinese  pseudoscience like transferring DNA via signal DNA teleportation\
  \ (also called DNA transduction)    highly compartmentalize where no one knowing\
  \ what is going or whom doing what or what is end goal or bottom line or what organization\
  \ sponsoring/controlling and will benefit from it (or have control of the end product)\
  \  anyway idea is based on internet technology hierarchy structure pyramid where\
  \ idea to confuse/destroy enemy get introduce not as whole idea/information/project\
  \ but by very little bits and pieces of information simular to internet protocols\
  \ when data get send in packets and when enemy asemble all of the packets of information\
  \ and draw big picture/conclusion based on getting hold at least 85 to 97%  data\
  \ packets... whole operation could be runned by quarter century"
