Text: "A cacophony of European languages fills our student-packed coach arriving back\
  \ in Krakow.\n\nIt\u2019s a marked contrast to the chilling quiet we have just experienced:\
  \ leaving behind those infamous wrought iron letters \u2018Arbeit Macht Frei\u2019\
  , the steel barbed wire, wooden Orwellian watchtowers and red brick barracks. No\
  \ match with the names jotted inside my Father\u2019s Filofax have been found. We\
  \ had known it was a longshot.\n\nLiving apart as I grew up, annual anticipated\
  \ travels with my Father had been characterised by chlorine aplenty or sleeping\
  \ under the stars. Boarding the plane to Krakow, I had prepared myself for a harrowing\
  \ journey into the past.\n\nThe morning after the tour, the nostalgic aroma of sweet\
  \ Cholla bread fills the breakfast room. We are staying in Kazimierz, Krakow\u2019\
  s Jewish Quarter. Outside, clangs of scaffold being assembled echo around the courtyard.\
  \ A gregarious elderly man clad in corduroy grins a toothless smile at us. He, clutching\
  \ a pint of Zywiec; we, our maps. Tourists are welcomed in this University city\
  \ and the atmosphere is unfailingly buoyant.\n\nRays of April sunlight break through\
  \ gaps between towering trees flanking the New Jewish Cemetery. Undergraduate Anne\
  \ explains to us in skillful English that many headstones were removed and used\
  \ as paving slabs in nearby camps during the war but, thanks to a local engineer,\
  \ most have since been returned.\n\nThe recovered parts form a stone montage of\
  \ apertures into former lives. My Father and I trace the unfinished epitaphs and\
  \ half-names for clues, before finally conceding that none are recognisable to us.\
  \ We are overwhelmed by something else though. The testament of this vast wall not\
  \ only to remembrance, but to resilience.\n\nIt\u2019s a sentiment which flows through\
  \ Krakow, a city brimming with reminders of the horrors of its recent past but refusing\
  \ to be defined by it. As we turn the cobble street corner from the cemetery, we\
  \ stop to photograph a Chagall-like mural in vivid colour.\n\nBy dusk a cheering\
  \ throng of young people has gathered in front of a stage by our hotel. A twentysomething\
  \ all in Levi\u2019s enlightens us, \u2018it\u2019s the annual festival of Jewish\
  \ culture!\u2019 Asked if he is Jewish, he smiles and shakes his head. My Father\
  \ and I spend our final night in Krakow on the hotel balcony watching Klesma played\
  \ to a lively crowd of the influencers of tomorrow \u2013 Jews and non-Jews. It\u2019\
  s an ultimate celebration of artistic expression, progress and joy. Unwittingly,\
  \ we have booked the best seats in the house."
