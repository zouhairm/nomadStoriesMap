Text: "I grew up in a small town in Northeastern Wisconsin. A small, predominantly\
  \ white, middle-class town, to be precise. We didn't talk about this, though. Race\
  \ was a taboo topic unless being emphasized on the news and culture meant making\
  \ a family tree and baking goods for the \"International Festival.\" It was a surprise\
  \ to my entire family when I told them that I had applied to the teaching program\
  \ at my university. It was an even bigger surprise to me when I got accepted into\
  \ the program. And everyone got thrown for a loop when I was packing a large bag\
  \ full of supplies to take with me to Uganda in order to teach for three months.\n\
  \nI had very little travel experience; my entire family had very little travel experience.\
  \ And this was their worst nightmare coming true. \n\nMy aging grandmother typed\
  \ up a letter begging me \"not to do this to my family.\" My mother said that my\
  \ father didn't sleep for the 89 days leading up to my departure and somehow lost\
  \ even more sleep for the 92 days of my absence. My best friend promised, even to\
  \ this day, to never say a word to my family about the Ebola outbreak near the area\
  \ where we were staying.\n\nAnd what did I do? I loved. I loved my family for caring\
  \ so much that I almost let it stunt my growth. I loved my friends for inspiring\
  \ me and reminding me of my own strengths. I loved my students for asking all of\
  \ the hard questions. I loved my co-teachers for their patience and generosity.\
  \ I loved knowing that I didn't and couldn't actually know or understand without\
  \ asking. I loved being uncomfortable in a place so far from my expected. I loved\
  \ that I developed a new definition of \"love.\" I loved, I loved, I loved.\n\n\
  I would be lying if I told you my decision to teach in Uganda pushed me to the edge.\
  \ What this decision actually did was convincingly nudge me up to that edge and\
  \ then simply hip-check me off, where I fell fast and hard into the all-consuming\
  \ wanderlust that forces us to actually experience the answers to all of our questions\
  \ about our planet and the people who live on it. I was born into a generation that\
  \ has tasked itself with expanding perspectives while broadening views. This travel\
  \ experience opened me up to what it means to travel-to live, to learn, to teach,\
  \ to love-and to why I believe every person should be experiencing this themselves.\n\
  \nSince then, I've kept going. And I'll stop when I've experienced it all. Twice."
