Text: "We started this holiday with the same expectations as before\u2026new locales\
  \ to see and exotic food to eat coupled with a lot of fun. But this was going to\
  \ be different.\n\nIt was not easy driving through Sikar, which is situated in Rajasthan,\
  \ India. An hour\u2019s drive from there took us to Lohagarh, an oasis in the middle\
  \ of this desert. The lush green orange and mango orchards, the coconut trees and\
  \ the flowers led the way to the natural pond filled with cool water.\n\nAfter the\
  \ dip, we were ready to satisfy the gastronomical urge. What a lovely place overladen\
  \ with fresh produce! We were sure there was a sumptuous meal waiting for us!\n\n\
  We walked through the oasis looking for a restaurant not realizing that it was not\
  \ a tourist location. \n\nWe had reached the edge of the oasis. The sight of two\
  \ tiny hutments brought us unprecedented joy.  We peeped in one. It was abandoned.\
  \ Obviously, the lack of opportunities had taken its toll!\n\nGingerly, we stepped\
  \ into the other one. Ah\u2026.some aluminum vessels. This must spell good luck\
  \ for us. We were famished!\n\nThe gentleman there got a jolt when he saw us\u2026\
  he never expected to see outsiders. This was where the locals ate\u2026.and this\
  \ was much past their lunchtime.\n\nThis place had no waiter, tables or chairs.\
  \ There was one platform that served as the serving, cooking and eating area.\n\n\
  \u201CSo what is there to eat?\u201D \n\nI expected a rattling of dishes from an\
  \ elaborate menu card, like in any other restaurant. \n\nThe gentleman stretched\
  \ himself lazily. After all, what was the hurry? People stayed and worked in the\
  \ oasis only. They did not have to go anywhere.\n\u201CLet me see what is there\u2026\
  \u201D He said as he slowly removed the lids from the three vessels kept in front\
  \ of him. \n\nThis was a bit disappointing but we had no option.\n\n\u201CWell,\
  \ I have a curry, some potatoes, and mashed brinjal.\u201D\n\nWhat followed next\
  \ was a meal of unprecedented magnitude\u2026.not in terms of lavishness but through\
  \ the love and care it carried.\n\nThe gentleman served us in copper plates. He\
  \ lighted up his mud stove, heated up each dish and garnished them carefully with\
  \ the local herbs and condiments. Then he made fresh bread by baking it in the wooden\
  \ ash. The taste was just out of this world. When we were done, he lovingly coerced\
  \ us to have just a little bit more. \n\nNow, this was not a hotel\u2026it was a\
  \ home.\n\nWe were not paying for food\u2026.we were being offered a meal!\n\nThere\
  \ was no price list as there was no menu. And what do you pay for love and care?"
