Text: "As a shy preadolescent, the idea of dancing appealed to me as no verbalisation\
  \ was needed to communicate. The idea of speaking petrified me, I preferred to express\
  \ myself with a pair of ballet shoes. Many years later when I was old enough to\
  \ travel on my own, I was delighted to learn about different cultural dances with\
  \ every country I passed through. \n\nOne evening in Sofia, I heard the sound of\
  \ traditional strings and drums accompanied with cheerful Bulgarian shouts in the\
  \ distance. It piqued my interest and I followed the music. I found myself walking\
  \ through a small park surrounded by office buildings, I went past a fountain and\
  \ stood in a square before the neoclassical National Theatre. \n\nMost of the food\
  \ stalls around the square had already closed, but it was lively as ever, an enthusiastic\
  \ crowd gathered around a line of people dressed in everyday wear and expertly tapping\
  \ their feet to a folk song. The line of dancers was led by a man dressed in jeans\
  \ and t-shirt, proudly waving the national flag with one hand while the other held\
  \ the next person\u2019s hand. In fact, everybody seemed to be holding hands as\
  \ they performed. \n\nRight step, right step, right step, left tap, back step, left\
  \ tap. It was a simple sequence that repeated over and over as dancers slowly advanced\
  \ in a circle. I watched with interest as members from the crowd kept joining the\
  \ performance, a momentary break in the line before they joined hands, smoothly\
  \ continuing to tap their feet away.   \n\nHow often do you get to try a traditional\
  \ Bulgarian dance? I ran up to join the fun. \u201CExcuse me.\u201D I murmured as\
  \ I reached to between a pair of hands. A lady with beautiful wavy hair and a young\
  \ man with a shaven head beamed warmly at me and clasped my hands. After the initial\
  \ couple of awkward missteps, I came to match everyone\u2019s rhythm.\n\nThe crowd\
  \ cheered as the beat sped up, we danced faster, spinning round and round. Just\
  \ when I thought my feet couldn\u2019t possibly tap any faster, the song came to\
  \ a grand finale. The crowd roared and applauded us. And just like that the group\
  \ of dancers dispersed back into their everyday lives. The lady beside me gave me\
  \ an approving tap on the back before she too disappeared into the crowd. \n\nI\
  \ was no longer a shy teenage girl that preferred to dance over meeting new people.\
  \ However I smiled as I realised dance was a language of it\u2019s own, in a foreign\
  \ country it allowed me to connect with locals far better than words could."
