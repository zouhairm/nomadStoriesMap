Text: "It was supposed to be a perfect day in Tamarindo, the monkeys were hanging\
  \ from the trees, the sun was up and the fruit of the local market was fresher than\
  \ ever. \n\nTamarindo is famous for its gigantic beach, a beach of white sand and\
  \ wild waves that merged with the mouth of a river where crocodiles lay.\n\nIt was\
  \ August, a month where the stifling heat and the strong tropical storms coexisted\
  \ together without problem. I had become used to it and when the storm came and\
  \ dyed the sky all gray I was in the water surfing or at least trying. At that precise\
  \ moment it was as if we were in a remote place where tourists couldn\u2019t access,\
  \ they all had gone to look shelter from the rain in the typical beach bars the\
  \ where beer tripled its original price for them.\n\nThe scene was idyllic, about\
  \ fifteen people were sitting on our boards watching an endless ocean filled with\
  \ drops, our bodies were swaying slightly while behind us there was a whole jungle\
  \ receiving thunders and flashes of lightning. A group of local people smiled at\
  \ me because I was the only person who hadn\u2019t escaped and they invited me to\
  \ come out of the water and talk.\n\nWe sat on the sand, it was still raining and\
  \ the Ticos were telling stories about the crocodiles and the endless summer nights.\
  \ One of them named Roberto, told me firmly that sometimes the only thing that matters\
  \ about people is not who they are, where they come from, or where they are going,\
  \ that the only thing that matters about people is how they make you feel and that\
  \ when I returned home in two weeks I could take those feelings with me.\n\nTwo\
  \ beers and an hour later I started my way back to the camp where I was staying.\
  \ For a month I slept in a tent in the middle of the jungle, the nights were lonely\
  \ and my dreams were fused with the sounds of wild animals.\n\nWhat Roberto told\
  \ me made more sense than ever. It wasn\u2019t only the boys like Roberto, it was\
  \ also Carla, the girl at the supermarket who greeted you because she has seen you\
  \ more than a week in the town, or Mike the man who every time he saw you down the\
  \ street, he would told you secrets so that the mosquitoes would stop biting you.\n\
  \nTamarindo barely had anything, just one highroad and some shops but it was very\
  \ rich in humanity. There, the hair gets lighter and the skin gets darker, the water\
  \ gets warmer and the drinks get colder, the music gets louder and the nights get\
  \ longer. Life gets better and you learn that you don\u2019t have to escape from\
  \ the rain, you have to enjoy it."
