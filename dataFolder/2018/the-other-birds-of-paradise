Text: "\u201CKim, do you like birds?\u201D asked Mar\xEDa as she cleared the remains\
  \ of our lunch of rice, black beans and fried plantains.\n\nCosta Rica\u2019s colorful\
  \ avians had captivated me over the past three months, and Mar\xEDa\u2019s question\
  \ set my curiosity alight. Her tone suggested an impending treat, yet we were in\
  \ a fishing village and far from the rainforest\u2014did people keep toucans as\
  \ pets here in Cuajiniquil? Would I finally see a resplendent quetzal, the red-blue-green\
  \ jewel of the tropical Americas?\n\nMar\xEDa finished the dishes and smiled. Bright\
  \ sunlight glowed through the lace curtains behind her. \u201CGet your shoes,\u201D\
  \ she said. \u201CAntonio is waiting.\u201D\n\nWe walked down the village\u2019\
  s earthen road toward the river. The rows of brightly-painted houses and blaring\
  \ stereos soon gave way to pod-laden guanacaste trees and the throbbing hum of cicadas.\
  \ \n\nThis northwest shoulder of Costa Rica is a biodiversity gold mine. The World\
  \ Heritage-listed Area de Conservaci\xF3n Guanacaste (ACG) covers 2% of the country\u2019\
  s surface but holds an astonishing two thirds of its known species. With a strong\
  \ focus on conservation uncommon to developing nations, Costa Rica has built its\
  \ economy on a base of tourism and all things \u201Ceco\u201D. \n\nBut progress\
  \ is gradual, and the landscape recounts a history marked by contrast. Even in the\
  \ ACG, grasslands\u2014scars from generations of cattle ranching\u2014mark where\
  \ dry forests once stood. \n\nWe continued along the river, and after ten minutes\
  \ of inhaling sulphurous mangrove reek arrived at a clearing. Men were standing\
  \ around a makeshift pen. A stocky man in a white shirt waved to us (Antonio, Mar\xED\
  a\u2019s husband, I surmised). His other hand kept a firm grasp on the rooster under\
  \ his arm. \n\nThen I noticed the cages, and saw a man in snakeskin boots collecting\
  \ wads of colones from the waiting crowd.\n\nMy fantasies of toucans and quetzals\
  \ evaporated. I watched the cockfight in a daze: men shouting, stamping as Antonio\u2019\
  s bird succumbed to the sharpened spurs of its rival. On the walk home, Antonio\
  \ chatted affably to me, his white shirt now splattered with rooster blood. \n\n\
  Costa Ricans are as diverse and wonderful as the land they inhabit. Many advocate\
  \ for sustainable tourism. Others push to expand the reach of protected areas. Still\
  \ others open their homes to foreign students and treat them like family.\n\nThat\
  \ night I was pondering the duality of our relationship with nature when Mar\xED\
  a emerged from the kitchen with a heavy tray of food and asked sweetly, \u201CKim,\
  \ do you like chicken?\u201D"
