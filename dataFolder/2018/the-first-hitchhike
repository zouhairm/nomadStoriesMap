Text: "It was in Franz Josef\u2019s Glacier, New Zealand, that I decided to hitchhike.\n\
  I had thought it to be too dangerous until I met Wei, a tiny 18-year old from Taiwan\
  \ hitchhiking around the South Island.\n'If she can do it, so can I!', was what\
  \ I told myself as I approached the main road.\nIcy peaks were the backdrop and\
  \ the street was covered with pink signs advertising that Saturday is \"Doughnut-day\"\
  .\nI had my backpack and a bag of custard filled ones.\nI smiled and held my thumb\
  \ up, car after car drove past me. Suddenly a white car pulled up, I shuffled in.\n\
  The back seat was full of spears!\n'Oh I free dive and spear-fish', he laughed at\
  \ my shocked expression. His name was Clinton.\nHe offered me a mint from a glass\
  \ jar next to him. 'No thanks\u2019 I said, \u2018for all I know those are roofies'.\n\
  He laughed again and had one of my doughnuts.\nWhen you hitchhike, there is an expectation\
  \ to sing for your ride. I told funny anecdotes from my travels. \nClinton himself\
  \ was from Pahia on the North Island, a 27-year old set to discover his native land.\n\
  He was headed for lake Wanaka, and so was I.\nOur first stop was Fox Glacier. The\
  \ walk up to it brought me closer to the glacier than in Franz Joseph. Clinton jumped\
  \ over the security fence, wild child!\nHe took off his top and jumped into the\
  \ light blue glacial river. Shivering he climbed back up, carrying a huge block\
  \ of ice.\n'I'm going to keep it in my chillybin!' \nKiwi slang for cooler.\nWe\
  \ drove on and picked up another hitchhiker, an Aussie called Gideon, he had been\
  \ waiting for hours.\n'It's because you have a beard', said Clinton. \nWe bought\
  \ ice for the little glacier; drove past flowering fields, a million sheep, making\
  \ many stops. \nWe ran the rope bridge across the Blue Pools of Haast, scaring a\
  \ tour group wearing mouth masks.  A tad ridiculous as it was the purest air I have\
  \ ever breathed.\nAt Lake Matheson we did a trek, leading to the View of Views.\
  \ It is Mt Cook, the tallest peak in NZ, reflected perfectly in the lake.\nFern\
  \ forests surrounding, we could have been in Jurassic Park.\nAt one point we were\
  \ pulled over and Clinton was issued a speeding ticket. To our surprise a film crew\
  \ came out with the policeman, recording the incident for a cop-show!\nJust before\
  \ Wanaka was Roaring Billy Falls. Small piles of stacked stones covered the shore\
  \ across from the waterfall, Cairns. Travellers build them next to landmarks.\n\
  As a meditative exercise, we built our own stack. \nLeaving a piece of us there,\
  \ before continuing our journey."
