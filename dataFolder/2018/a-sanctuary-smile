Text: "The Cambodian humidity lingered around a group of destitute hikers, slumped\
  \ in a circle on a neglected fallen log. Our journey began, delivered on the back\
  \ of a truck through the huts and homesteads of the Putang village, in the Mondulkiri\
  \ province of Cambodia.  \n\nAlthough still damp and tired from hiking through the\
  \ jungle, our excitement for an elephant encounter could not be quelled. The owner,\
  \ aptly named Mr Tree, stood at the apex of the circle, \"The sanctuary not only\
  \ rescues elephants from the tourism industry, but also provides the local tribes\
  \ with employment and resources to allow them to live a comfortable life,\" the\
  \ passion in his voice stoic. \n\nWhen the elephants emerged their eyes beamed with\
  \ a venerable glaze, hiding a certain sadness that lived dormant and docked in a\
  \ cloudy bay of past memories. Memories that took them back to days in which they\
  \ were starved, ridden with heavy crates upon their backs, drugged and used to carry\
  \ logs in a monotonous cycle for decades. The abundance of care and freedom that\
  \ they experienced in the present, gave them an aura of shimmering happiness as\
  \ they danced amongst the bamboo and showered themselves in mud. We lead them to\
  \ the river where we each took turns washing the elephants, which improves not only\
  \ their general health and hygiene but also their mental wellbeing. As the elephants\
  \ flapped their ears with a wild sense of contentment spraying mud and water onto\
  \ my face, I smiled. This smile not only spread across my face but trickled down\
  \ into my very core, radiating my being. This experience was not about conquering\
  \ an animal; this experience was about showing compassion to an animal to heal the\
  \ wounds of the past. When you travel, you are often enamoured by a local connection;\
  \ the food, culture, the hospitality. But connecting to the local wildlife gives\
  \ you a sense of wonder that transcends each of the preceding categories. For a\
  \ glorious moment in time, the elephant and I would lock eyes and truly see one\
  \ another. Life undulates chaotically in our numbered days on this earth, but if\
  \ we strive to learn and better ourselves, then the connections we make are stronger\
  \ and more defining. Even though we may never see each other again, the connection\
  \ that the elephants and I shared was the most meaningful that I experienced within\
  \ Cambodia. Sometimes connections aren\u2019t about the words you share and time\
  \ you spend, in moments like these, words cannot repurpose the feelings that rise\
  \ up inside of you."
