Text: "I immediately felt like Owen Wilson\u2019s character in the movie Midnight\
  \ in Paris, although I, indeed, wasn\u2019t in Paris. Entering the door led me to\
  \ a cheerful murmur, parties of different looking people and a classic scene of\
  \ late 1800\u2019s saloon. The dusty mirrors, pealing paint and webbed pharmacy\
  \ bottles on the shelves were inarguably old. When I closed my eyes I could easily\
  \ see Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dal\xED and Antoni Gaud\xED sitting in the corner,\
  \ which, the story says, they did 100 years ago. (Talking about inner circles, right?).\
  \ For the first time in a while I could sense being connected to the past, it was\
  \ flouting all around me.\n\n\n\u201CWhat can I get you, chicas?\u201D, asked the\
  \ bartender with a thick Spanish accent. \u201CAbsinthe, no?\u201D He continued.\
  \ No, it\u2019s not that we looked like teenagers leaving home for the first time\
  \ and looking for some serious partying that could by no means be described as classy.\
  \ Since that\u2019s the association word absinthe brings to me. But how wrong have\
  \ I been. This old bar that originally opened in 1820, is famous for it\u2019s bohemian\
  \ way of serving absinthe. The art of drinking must match the art of living.\n\n\
  We got out tools (absinthe, sugar, fork and a bottle of water) for preparing the\
  \ authentic bohemian absinthe but the confused look on our faces was communicating\
  \ clearly that we\u2019d never done it before. A local man sitting next to us kindly\
  \ offered to help us and we of course accepted the help. This gentleman, who introduced\
  \ himself as Jaume, told us how he\u2019d been coming to this place for ten years\
  \ and it still hadn't lost its charm. \u201CHow fascinating\u201D, we thought to\
  \ ourselves and tried to remember any bar back home in Helsinki that didn\u2019\
  t renew their concept every two years for the money.\n\nAs the conversation continued,\
  \ Jaume pointed out one more thing that made the place unique: the variety of customers.\
  \ It was a fine mix of young and older locals, tourists and struggling artists.\
  \ These days, knowing the economical and political problems caused by excessive\
  \ tourism in Barcelona, it\u2019s not that easy to find a place where both locals\
  \ and tourists enjoy the night side by side. See, the word tourist, is sometimes\
  \ more likely to cause chills among locals rather than excitement. Despite of that,\
  \ fortunately, joyful coexistence and, furthermore, encounters like ours still happen\
  \ since these conversations hopefully enrich the lives of both sides. Maybe it\u2019\
  s like absinthe: there\u2019s much more to it than the reputation if you give it\
  \ a chance."
