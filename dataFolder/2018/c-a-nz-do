Text: "Quite simply, the last thing I'd ever expect I would be doing was swimming\
  \ 11m underwater, in full scuba gear with a Green Turtle moving along in its own\
  \ world seemingly oblivious to me and the other two strange beings bobbing about\
  \ near its feeding area on the Poor Knights Islands off the coast of northern New\
  \ Zealand.\nThat said, I'd already had a few of those last-thing-I-expected moments\
  \ on my semi-planned trip which eventually took me to New Zealand.\nAfter all, it\
  \ had begun on a schooner in Nova Scotia, Canada where a project with the purpose\
  \ of raising awareness of the amount of plastic in the oceans was looking for extra\
  \ people. It was when we were seemingly flying along having a 'race' with another\
  \ schooner, with the deck at an angle, the rocky coastline whizzing past that I\
  \ had to take a mental step back and ask was this really happening?\nI was in a\
  \ slightly different mood about 2 weeks later when I had a night of being violently\
  \ sea sick, I thought maybe this wasn't for me as the boat was going to cross the\
  \ Atlantic back to Europe, via the Azores. The silver lining of my sea sickness\
  \ night is that I was on the deck in the early morning at the right time to see\
  \ a Humpback Whale fluke right next to the boat which made the previous night worthwhile!\n\
  For fun more than anything else, I looked for volunteering places on the Azores\
  \ with a conservation bent and found one!\nSo next, I found myself helping out in\
  \ an Azorean garden, pruning banana trees and picking acorns to make acorn beer\
  \ and having time to explore Angra do Heroismo and the rest of Terceira Island.\
  \ The person for whom I was volunteering was organising an exhibition and I had\
  \ a surreal night for me at the exhibition opening, being amongst the local modern\
  \ art community and hoping that it wasn\u2019t too obvious that my Portuguese was\
  \ not what it could be.\nJust before my Azores trip, I applied for a New Zealand\
  \ Working Holiday Visa with the incentive of this being my last chance to apply\
  \ before I turned 31. I knew that one day I wanted to go to there and I\u2019ve\
  \ found that spending a decent amount of time in a place is that best way to get\
  \ a real taste how it is to live there.\nI\u2019ve continued volunteering at conservation\
  \ related places dotted around New Zealand. I suppose the absolute highlight was\
  \ being joined at breakfast time by a Kiwi chick which had just been removed from\
  \ its nest to begin its journey to Auckland Zoo.\nSo even when things don\u2019\
  t go plan, a good or C-A-NZ Do attitude gets you through!"
