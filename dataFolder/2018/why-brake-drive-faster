Text: "My body was rigid with tension, my hands clenched into shaking fists. I wanted\
  \ to shut my eyes, but I knew my friends were depending on me to help watch the\
  \ road. It was almost dark, and soon, the kangaroos would be coming.\n  My study\
  \ abroad friends and I were driving on Stuart highway, in between the ghost towns\
  \ of Coober Pedy and Alice Springs, on our way to see Uluru, the famous giant rock.\
  \ We had been driving all day, and our eyes ached from staring at empty plains of\
  \ red dirt, peppered with spiky shrubs and trees tough and lean like the Outback\
  \ itself. The plant life was low to the ground, so we were able to see out for miles\
  \ in every direction. It made the sunset a spectacular experience, 360 degrees of\
  \ blazing sky.\n But as the sunset started fading into glowing hues of blue and\
  \ purple, we began to worry. We weren\u2019t near the campsite yet, and it would\
  \ be dark soon. The kangaroos would be coming.\n We had rented for this trip two\
  \ cars from the Wicked Campers Company. They were about as cheap as you could get\
  \ in the Australian rental car business, and were consequently lacking an essential\
  \ tool for traversing the Outback: the \u2018roo bar, a strong steel rod that went\
  \ on the front of your car to prevent damage in case of a collision with a kangaroo.\
  \ All decent off-roading vehicles in Australia had them.\n Kangaroos are much more\
  \ active at night than they are in the daytime. If they see anything moving in the\
  \ darkness, especially bright lights, they will run to investigate. My friend Jannah\
  \ hit three kangaroos on her last trip to the Outback, and without the \u2018roo\
  \ bar she certainly would have been seriously injured, if not killed.\n Night had\
  \ arrived. We were driving as fast as possible to get to the campsite. All of us\
  \ had our eyes peeled for kangaroos. I knew we shouldn\u2019t be driving so fast,\
  \ but we were desperate to be safe. \n Suddenly Aaron, our driver, slammed on the\
  \ brakes. All of us jolted forward. I worried that the car behind us would hit,\
  \ but they braked in time, tires skidding on the pavement.\n Camels. Not kangaroos.\
  \ About 15 camels, standing in the middle of the road. Not the least bit fazed by\
  \ two cars hurtling towards them. They just stood there chewing, staring at us,\
  \ mouths gaping. \n They were clustered at the entryway to our campsite, which was\
  \ shrouded in darkness. The light at the entrance had burned out, and the tiny dirt\
  \ road was almost invisible. If we hadn\u2019t stopped for them, we wouldn\u2019\
  t have ever seen it."
