Text: "Traveling around South America is never quite typical\u2026so I should have\
  \ been prepared for some twists to spice things up. Signing up for the silver mine\
  \ tour with a \u2018local\u2019 guide in Bolivia, I envisioned something from a\
  \ movie- standing out on a platform above a pit where miners were working, hearing\
  \ some historical facts, and heading into a museum or gift-shop-like room where\
  \ we\u2019d see samples of what came from the mining process. \nMy first hint that\
  \ I\u2019d been delusional was when our lovely guide, Myra, took us to the local\
  \ market to prepare for our excursion. She prefaced the tour by saying she was an\
  \ old miner's daughter, noting that we'd get a very authentic experience. In the\
  \ market, we were charged with finding some headlamps, coca leaves (to offer the\
  \ miners) and some dynamite. That's right. In the streets of Bolivia, they sell\
  \ sticks of dynamite and fuse strings you can DIY to create an exploding piece of\
  \ TNT. (Hoping that some crazy terrorists never find out about this business). Apparently,\
  \ the miners use the dynamite to break through areas of the mine to unearth more\
  \ silver. After the initial shock of seeing these, we headed off in all our gear.\
  \ \nSurprise #2: no viewing platform. A small hole in the mountain you had to crawl\
  \ through to delve into the depths of the cave. The little headlamps on our helmets\
  \ navigated us through tunnels and up narrow staircases of rock as we attempted\
  \ to survive the pungent smell of must and not breathe \u2018too much\u2019 underground.\
  \ \nMuch to my dismay, we finally hit a steep part I couldn\u2019t climb (I had\
  \ bruised my coccyx/tailbone sandboarding a few days earlier). Myra left me some\
  \ coca leaves in case I needed anything. A few minutes passed\u2026and a few more\
  \ (I was starting to get nauseous)\u2026and my headlamp went out. Thought \u201C\
  Great. I\u2019m  standing in a mine, in the dark, breathing in some toxic fumes,\
  \ and hearing blasts of dynamite going off in the distance.\u201D \nMy glow-in-the-dark\
  \ watch told me 30 minutes had passed since my crew had left. Just as I heard a\
  \ miner\u2019s cart squeaking below and began debating if I could yell or throw\
  \ some coca leaves down to get his attention, little glimmers of light bounced hope\
  \ into the darkness to signal my group returning. Myra slowly escorted us back to\
  \ the fresh air again. But not until we prayed to the smoking shrine at the exit\
  \ for safekeeping on our way out. \nLater that night, we watched a documentary about\
  \ how 8 million people had died in that mine. Still thankful I was not one of them."
