Text: "The hazy outlines of the slightly mist laden fields were far from hazy to my\
  \ eyes. They shone bright and clear like a shining summer afternoon. For the countless\
  \ times I had embarked on this journey between the mind and the heart, the way was\
  \ like the back of my palm. \nMeerut, my home turf is a small city but a large town.\
  \ I cling to my belief of it being a town, for I fear that the soul of my homeland\
  \ might be lost in the overzealousness of proving itself to be a city. Every Sunday,\
  \ I must bid farewell to it, to return to where lights could blind nights and haze\
  \ shrouds the day- Delhi. On this train journey, to and from, the land that gave\
  \ me life to the land that makes my life, I travel through spaces of mind, time\
  \ and thought. I stare out of the window every single time, to be greeted by the\
  \ old, shrivelling railway bridges that pass-through Delhi, just like peeping into\
  \ the future through an ancient vessel. The hustle and bustle at its very summit\
  \ at the time I leave for home, mostly early evenings, on a jiving Saturday of the\
  \ city. I can, with my eyes closed, sense the nearing of the end of city limits,\
  \ for the air around is filled with fumes rising from the growing mountains of landfills,\
  \ perched right at the border of the city. The window does not show me these growing\
  \ mountains, instead it showcases the last breaths of a mirage called the Yamuna\
  \ river, which might reduce to nothingness in no time. At this sight, my heart is\
  \ filled, part with gratitude and part with helplessness. Not everyone would get\
  \ to witness the gold filled sheen of the sun setting on the Yamuna river, even\
  \ as it nears the dusk of its own existence. Despite knowing that the river is being\
  \ strangled to death, I am as helpless as the river itself, which just sits there,\
  \ waiting for death to put an end to its miserable being. \nI am yet to discover\
  \ the treasures of travelling across oceans, time zones and continents. Nevertheless,\
  \ I make most of what life has to offer to me. Not for a moment do I bat an eyelid\
  \ and let go off the scene that unfolds through the window of the local train. On\
  \ some days, I get glimpses of swaying sunflower fields, which jive to the beat\
  \ of the age old train engine. While on other days, I breathe in all the scent of\
  \ moist soil, freshly ploughed and ready to be sowed. I keep wondering to myself,\
  \ how can one journey offer something novel every week, but then isn\u2019t life\
  \ just the same?"
