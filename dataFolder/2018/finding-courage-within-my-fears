Text: "Over the next three days of trekking, you will have to take only what you can\
  \ carry. Those words resurfaced the fear I had been burying since I decided to book\
  \ a solo adventure trip to Vietnam, a known adventure travel destination, in hopes\
  \ of pushing myself outside of my comfort zone and recovering my confident and adventurous\
  \ personality.\n \nI was in SaPa, once a hill station for the French but now premier\
  \ trekking destination known for its spectacular views, mountainous ranges and rice\
  \ paddies about to begin my trek through the villages of the different hill tribes.\
  \ I would be spending each day trekking to a different village for lunch and then\
  \ spending the night in another at a homestay.\n \nI was especially worried about\
  \ this leg of my adventure as I had never completed a difficult or extensive trek\
  \ before and had been warned about the slipperiness of the trail due to the wet\
  \ weather. Tying my sneakers, not the best footwear for the occasion, I decided,\
  \ however, to follow through with my decision.\n \nWe set out off the main road\
  \ and I was transported to one of the most beautiful and serene landscapes I had\
  \ ever encountered where I immediately started to slip and slide. This continued\
  \ with almost every step as we traversed the slippery and muddy trails. My fear\
  \ quickly became not whether or not I could finish the trek but whether or not I\
  \ would finish it without any broken bones.\n \nJumps across creeks and different\
  \ bodies of water ended with one or both feet underwater or me just walking through.\
  \ Most walks through the rice paddies, where we were greeted by the locals and water\
  \ buffalos which are used for tilling the rice paddies, were done sideways taking\
  \ one side step at a time. Climbs up steep hills were completed on all fours and\
  \ downward descends done sitting but as the trek progressed I became more courageous.\n\
  \ \nBy the time we reached the homestay for the night, I was completely drenched\
  \ with sweat and exhausted but extremely proud of myself for having tested my strength\
  \ and bravery and succeeded. I had learned that courage isn\u2019t necessarily the\
  \ absence of fear but rather completing the action regardless of fear.\n \nSo when\
  \ told that the next part of the trek would be even more treacherous due to the\
  \ weather and asked if I wanted to cut my trek short and head back to town, I knew\
  \ I had to be resilient and courageous and complete what I had set out to with or\
  \ without fear, like anything else I would encounter in life going forward and I\
  \ said no."
