Text: "I would never forget my trip to Warsaw, Poland in the fall of 2013. Not only\
  \ because I was selected by the Deusche Welle Akademie to cover the COP19, that\
  \ year\u2019s major UN environmental conference, but because I was able to discover\
  \ an enticing city of ancient buildings, cobbled streets and at the moment foggy\
  \ weather, where I managed to make  few, but meaningful connections. One of those\
  \ was Nadia, a Portuguese journalist who hailed from the coastal town of Faro in\
  \ the Atlantic, not far from the Spanish border. \n\nNadia is an environmental journalist\
  \ and is a lot more experienced than I am. She speaks fluent Spanish because she\
  \ spent 3 years as a correspondent for a few Portuguese media in Mexico. In addition,\
  \ perhaps coincidentally, most of the time she has been doing her job near to the\
  \ sea, as she was living in Veracruz at the time.  As she and I used to walk through\
  \ the narrow streets of Warsaw\u2019s historical center, with its imposing castles\
  \ and ancient houses, Nadia would talk to me about the intricacies of power in Western\
  \ European countries, which prevented aggressive measures to reduce their carbon\
  \ footprint. Moreover, while we had coffee and sandwiches in front of the Chopin\
  \ Museum, she convinced me about the viability of mass-distributing solar power.\n\
  \nAs we walked through the Warsaw zoo, we saw enviously how the bears seemed so\
  \ indifferent to the chill of November while we discussed if the tropical were going\
  \ to be successful in convincing the world about attempting to reduce average weather\
  \ for at least 1.5 degrees Celsius. We ate peanuts while the monkeys played in their\
  \ yard and contemplated the giraffes in their noble eating while discussed whether\
  \ Greece was going to put any level of interest in environmental issues with their\
  \ ongoing economic crisis. \n\nThe opposite side of Warsaw, the modern city, presented\
  \ us a stark reminder of how the winds of change came and stayed after the fall\
  \ of the iron curtain. As we walked and window-shopped through one off its mega-sized\
  \ malls, Nadia told me about her love for the sea and her tendency to cover stories\
  \ about marine life. I will never forget her green eyes, her smile and how wise\
  \ she was. That is why now the chill of the european early winter, mostly giver\
  \ me good memories. \n\nAs it was years before the Paris agreement, the conference\
  \ back then didn't manage to get most significant results in terms of the environment,\
  \ so meeting Nadia was definitely the most productive outcome I got from it."
