Text: "My story begins in Greenland, in a remote fjord about 9 hours by water from\
  \ the nearest town. Greenland in itself is a very remote place, with little use\
  \ for roads and a heavy reliance on boat travel. It's covered mostly in ice, and\
  \ although I was there in July, it was generally about 5 degrees. Our campsite was\
  \ in an area known to the locals as \"The Dark Place\" because there is nothing\
  \ there, no animals, no people, nothing. At The Dark Place, we had no electricity,\
  \ plumbing, or contact with the outside world other than a satellite phone. It was\
  \ the quietest place I have ever been. The only sound was the thundering crash of\
  \ ice chunks as they cracked off a nearby glacier, the stream that passed through\
  \ our campsite, and the snoring coming out of our tents. \nThe lack of amenities\
  \ usually wasn't so bad, with the exception of a shower. We brought one of those\
  \ solar shower bags, but it could never get warm enough to use. We were doing pretty\
  \ physical work, hiking up and down boulder fields every day. Eventually, we broke\
  \ and tried to find a way to wash. There was a small water hole about 50m from our\
  \ camp, formed from ice melt. It was only deep enough to go up to your waist, not\
  \ that any of us managed that. The water in this puddle was so cold that sometimes\
  \ there were icicles on the rim. I couldn't stand in it for more than 15 seconds\
  \ without going numb. I forewent extensive bathing pretty quickly and resorted to\
  \ baby wipes and trying to warm up with a hot water bottle. \nWhen the time came\
  \ for us to leave, all I could think about was a long, hot, shower. We definitely\
  \ smelled horrible, but our boat drivers hid it well, offering us food and taking\
  \ us to get beer. Then, our drivers asked us if we wanted to go to a hot spring.\
  \ None of us even knew that there was one on the way, but naturally we all agreed\
  \ immediately. \nBefore I knew it, we pulled up to a small wharf. There was a path\
  \ winding up the bank, and at the end of it, a small steamy hot spring. The view\
  \ was gorgeous, a grey sky overlooking mountains and icebergs with no sign of humanity\
  \ anywhere. It was the first hot water I had seen in 3 weeks, and we didn't wait\
  \ to peel off our layers and dunk ourselves in. We swam around, shedding layers\
  \ of dirt and letting the water warm our bones. We played in the water like kids\
  \ and floated on our backs to soak up the silence. When we got out and back into\
  \ our layers, I felt like a new woman. It was the last thing I had expected, which\
  \ made it that much sweeter."
