Text: "\u201CDon\u2019t you have shoes?\u201D asks Ahmed Izem.\nBemused (him) and\
  \ embarrassed (me), we look down. Fire and ice: red African earth meeting white,\
  \ sun-starved feet. Rugged and russet, Moroccan soil is exotic as Mars. Stood upon\
  \ this red planet, my feet look alien; specimens from an arctic star. Flip-floppin\u2019\
  \ heck. How far will I get?\nHiking boots may dangle in Marrakech\u2019s frenzied\
  \ Medina, amidst lanterns and crocodile skins, where men stand in shadows with scales\
  \ to weigh you for coins and Hassan serves twelve-spiced, rocket-fuel tea. We\u2019\
  re 150km north-east in Tanaghmeilt, Azilal. Ahmed, the village\u2019s first official\
  \ guide, was born here. \u201CThe city\u2019s useful,\u201D he says, \u201Cbut our\
  \ people are traditional \u2013 they have no identity cards.\u201D \nA donkey laden\
  \ with olive branches approaches, followed by an elder whose eyes tell me to lower\
  \ my camera in a flash. \u201CIt\u2019s a spiritual thing,\u201D Ahmed says. Berber\
  \ people live simply, sharing their land\u2019s riches with quiet respect. Their\
  \ eldest is a queen of 136 years. Technology is redundant. Medicinal plants preclude\
  \ pharmaceuticals; herbal tea forbids firewater. Ahmed plucks us wild asparagus\
  \ and crumbles eucalyptus leaves, urging we inhlale. He spies a camouflaged cricket.\
  \ \u201CShe knows to protect,\u201D he says, tenderly peeling her feet off a shrub.\
  \ \u201CMum fried these with salt like chips!\u201D Chuckling, he returns her to\
  \ safety.\nAhmed\u2019s trail down to Cascades d\u2019Ouzoud pool is steep, single-file,\
  \ sandy. As if the Atlas Mountains hollowed a humungous bowl to receive El Abid\
  \ River\u2019s overspill. We ants scuttle into the bowl to sip waterfall juice at\
  \ a minor cascade fed by the 110m tall Ouzoud Falls along the canyon. Heavy weather\
  \ has churned earth, muddying the water. Sheets of molten chocolate smooth over\
  \ rocks then spill into the gorge, frothing like milkshake. Willy Wonka would mine\
  \ gold here. Rainbows atomize the sunlit spray. I sink my hands in cool shallows,\
  \ press my palms into silken mud. Delicious.\nAhmed herds us on. I glimpse mountain\
  \ faces, time-lined and tree-bearded; mostly I watch my flip-flop-feet. Dodge rocks.\
  \ Guage drops. Swallow curses as I slip. I\u2019ve broken both ankles \u2013 my\
  \ left in the Himalayas; my right in Surrey Hills. Memory is my brake-pedal. \n\u201C\
  Can I help you?\u201D Ahmed asks, but his hand is already reaching for mine. \n\
  His palm intersects my eye-line, a longed-for arrow in a labyrinth. His solid grasp\
  \ squashes Muslim code which complicates such contact. I feel held by him. Protected.\
  \ Distant, in thunderous voice, water calls us."
