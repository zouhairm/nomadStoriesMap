Text: "My legs had carried me, and I didn't realize when I ended up in the suburbs.\
  \ The building next to which I had stopped looked as if it was about to collapse\
  \ - but it was still kept up by an invisible force. In this house, without a front\
  \ wall, lived the whole family: a mother and her children. I shouldn't have done\
  \ that, but I was staring at them for a while. I could not take my eyes off this\
  \ live theater. The mother was cooking the meal, children were making a tower from\
  \ the plastic bottles.\n\nGaziantep is a city of 800,000, near the border with Syria.\
  \ Residents are proud of it - it is said that a few years ago there was nothing\
  \ but a desert there. Now the business is developing, elegant hotels and modern\
  \ hospitals are being constructed. It will only be better - in \u0161\u0101'Allah,\
  \ they say. In air-conditioned stores, at colorful bazaars and crowded maqhas, you\
  \ can't feel that people are dying on the streets of Aleppo just hundred kilometers\
  \ away.\n\nThe inhabitants of Gaziantep are not insensitive to the suffering of\
  \ the neighbors. According to the Amnesty International report from 2016, the largest\
  \ number of refugees from Syria were taken by two countries: Jordan (2.7 million\
  \ people) and Turkey (2.5 million). Gaziantep is the first stop in the long passage\
  \ of Syrians. And this is not a temporary stop - some stay here long months before\
  \ they find the possibility or strength for the further journey. Many think that\
  \ when the conflict ends, they will be closer to their homes. Some of them live\
  \ in tent towns, but many - as they have crossed the borders illegally - live on\
  \ the streets or in the ruins of abandoned homes. The industrial capital of Antep\
  \ is full of them. That was the case for the family I met.\n\nThe child smiled at\
  \ me, I waved my hand, and just realized I was staring at them for ages. In that\
  \ smile and gesture was everything she couldn't tell me directly. There was children's\
  \ carelessness, which probably now is long gone. Maybe now she is begging on the\
  \ streets of Gaziantep, just like many Syrian kids do.\n\nNow I sit in an airplane,\
  \ on my the way back home. Returning to a peaceful life, holidays on the Gold Coast.\
  \ I give the customs officer the passport, which I have just because I was born\
  \ in the right place, at the right time. \"Welcome home\" - I hear while passing\
  \ the gate with the blue label \"EU citizens\".\n\nAt home with all four walls."
