Text: "I\u2019d been thinking about taking that first breath for months and when it\
  \ finally happened I was surprised by how naturally it came. I was breathing underwater.\
  \ I was scuba diving. Ok, maybe just in a pool, but in a few days time I\u2019d\
  \ be on the Great Barrier Reef.\n\nWith my life held within the tank on my back,\
  \ I descended into an alien world. In the grand scheme of things I barely scratched\
  \ the surface as I explored the first 30 metres, but it was enough to learn my own\
  \ significance, or perhaps the lack of it.\n\nI\u2019m not going to lie, deciding\
  \ to scuba dive stemmed from selfish reasons, an opportunity to add another adventure\
  \ sport to my resume and an excuse to travel. What I hadn\u2019t bargained for is\
  \ just how much the reef had to teach me. For three days I got to be the one on\
  \ the outside. The foreign body watching an underwater world. Finding Nemo had come\
  \ to life. Reef sharks cruised by, century old turtles slept, sting rays blindly\
  \ navigated the ocean floor and most impressively of all, 1600 of the world\u2019\
  s fish species went about their lives amongst the corals. In contrast the night\
  \ was eerily silent, a quiet, colourless world that didn\u2019t extend beyond the\
  \ light of my torch. Until that too was turned off, fingers were tightly crossed\
  \ that no Grey Reef Sharks entered the safety of the boat\u2019s floodlights; the\
  \ three minute safety stop suddenly seemed daunting. \n\nReflecting on my time one\
  \ memory remains distinct. Huddled in a group, most watched as a Green Turtle fed\
  \ from our instructors hand. As beautiful as this was I was distracted by what I\
  \ couldn\u2019t see. For the first time I couldn\u2019t see colour. There, staring\
  \ me in the face was the reality of coral bleaching, the world was literally turning\
  \ white. It was no longer some passing story on the news. It was right in front\
  \ of my eyes. In July 2016 I was confronted with the harsh reality that global warming\
  \ wasn\u2019t just a \u2018maybe\u2019, something for future generations to worry\
  \ about, it was happening today. In fact it was well and truely underway.  \n\n\
  I left Cairns a different person. I couldn\u2019t help but reflect on policy versus\
  \ reality. If the Great Barrier Reef is a World Heritage Site, a natural wonder\
  \ of the world, how can we accept as a direct result of our actions, it is dying?\
  \ The reef sparked a passion, a love and a fire in me. I had found a purpose in\
  \ the last place I expected to look. I know to sit idly by is not an option. I have\
  \ to act."
