Text: "Rolling sand dunes cast a wave of shadows over the oasis, as the sun bid adieu,\
  \ or rather, adios, to the inhabitants of Huacachina. Unfolding itself was a blanket\
  \ of stars which provided a new source of warmth. I sat atop a sand dune and used\
  \ the tip of my index finger to trace the outline of the constellations. Feeling\
  \ elated from the success of my first day of travel around Peru, I closed my eyes\
  \ and inhaled a cool breeze that whisked my mind away into a paradisal escape. For\
  \ me, an oasis was more than a geographical location. It was a state of mind. With\
  \ this understanding, I opened my eyes and exhaled all my worries away. Nothing\
  \ could shake this feeling of tranquility (or so I thought).\n\nIt was getting late\
  \ so I stood up, brushed the sand off of my bottom, and headed back down into town.\
  \ Most guests at the hostel I was staying at were asleep by the time I returned.\
  \ I changed into my pajamas, climbed into my bunk bed, and curled up into fetal\
  \ position. Somewhere between pondering the crippling questions of existence and\
  \ the taste of coconut-flavoured clouds, I started drifting in and out of consciousness\
  \ until I fell into a deep sleep. Suddenly, I felt my bed shake vigorously. At first,\
  \ I thought it was my bunkmate indulging in carnal pleasures with his new flame.\
  \ When I realized that the whole room was moving, my heart rate increased exponentially\
  \ and panic ensued. I watched in slow motion as an empty beer bottle inched its\
  \ way off of the desk adjacent to me and shattered. One by one, everyone in my dorm\
  \ awoke to the muffled sounds of terror being expelled from outside of our room.\
  \ We were experiencing an earthquake, and a strong one at that.\n\nIt couldn\u2019\
  t have lasted more than a minute, but a minute is a long time when your life flashes\
  \ before your eyes. The last tremor marked the true commencement of Mother Nature\u2019\
  s devastation. The electricity cut out all across town, and oddly enough, all that\
  \ remained was the sound system of the local discoteca. I darted towards the door\
  \ and went outside. A few guests turned on their phones to navigate their way around\
  \ the hostel courtyard. Whispers of frightened souls echoed all around me. The night\
  \ guard, who remained calm and collected, assured guests that everything would be\
  \ OK. For many of us, the real aftershock was digesting the fact that we had just\
  \ experienced a 7.1 magnitude earthquake in a desert oasis; the last thing we expected\
  \ in a place like this."
