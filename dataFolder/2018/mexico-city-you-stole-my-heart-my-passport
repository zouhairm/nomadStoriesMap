Text: "My passport was stolen within the first two hours of my 5-month backpacking\
  \ trip through Latin America. I felt lost & existential as I wandered around the\
  \ deafening Mexico City streets in search of the US Embassy. I walked by a tucked\
  \ in bookstore, a personal safe space, with a strange but tempting smell that filtered\
  \ out onto the street. Curiosity lead me inside, which was haphazardly organized\
  \ of books with titles I couldn\u2019t yet understand; some new, patiently waiting\
  \ to be cracked open for the first time, where others had pages worn down from all\
  \ the fingers of different hands flipping and reflipping back and forth. The fragrance\
  \ of the bookstore was different; it was more than the sweet scent of decaying used\
  \ books and the crisp chemical notes of new ones. As I began to walk further into\
  \ the store, I heard the crackling and hissing of onions hitting a frying pan, and\
  \ the smell of cooked vegetables started to infiltrate the classic bookstore perfume.\
  \ Behind the last tower of precariously placed books was a little cafe and an old,\
  \ thin woman in a tank top and apron, the rest of her body hiding behind a gigantic\
  \ frying pan, ( I\u2019m assuming she had pants on) chopping away. The medley of\
  \ smells was of two worlds I never knew I wanted to unite; I tried not to cry from\
  \ hunger and existentialism. \u201CTe gustar\xEDa pedir algo?\u201Dshe asks.\u201C\
  No hablar Espanol,\u201D I reply in broken Spanish.\u201CAh claro,\u201D she says,\u201C\
  \ Would you like to order anything?\u201DOh thank god, she speaks English, I thought.\
  \ I don\u2019t want to be one of those Americans who insist on being spoken to in\
  \ Spanish, but at that moment I just needed to be understood.\u201C We sell only\
  \ vegan tacos here.\u201D\u201CUm, I\u2019ll take two cacti\u201D, I embarrassingly\
  \ say in English. I watch her fold the ingredients into the tortillas and wrap them\
  \ up with a tenderness like she is tucking a child into bed. \u201CYour first time\
  \ in Mexico City?\u201D she asks and hands me a plastic plate with my first hot\
  \ meal of the day. \u201C Yah, I have been here for 5 hours. It has already been\
  \ an adventure.\u201DI think she could hear my exhaustion and self-deprecation.\
  \ \u201CThis is a tough city with a big heart,\u201D she began, \u201Cdon\u2019\
  t expect anything. It is ancient & young. It is poverty & generosity. It is spicy\
  \ & refreshing. It is drugs & spiritual reckoning. It is real & it is magic.\u201D\
  \ I\u2019m left standing mid-bite listening to her description, which makes much\
  \ more sense later. Mexico contains multitudes; the only synonym for Mexico is Mexico.\u201C\
  \ That will be 6 pesos, por favor.\u201D"
