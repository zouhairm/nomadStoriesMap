Text: "The rain poured heavily and the street lights dazzled in the droplets through\
  \ the windows and the pitch black. I tried to look out of the car but nothing was\
  \ recognizable. A new city has no point of reference.\n\nI wonder if he would be\
  \ nervous?\n\nI caught a glimpse of the rain flooding the streets partially submerging\
  \ the chassis of other cars (I briefly checked that my feet weren\u2019t wet and\
  \ touched the carpets to see if water had leaked through). Who knew Yangon would\
  \ be this busy on a Sunday night? \n\nThe horns, the lights, the shouting: complete\
  \ chaos. You can plan for everything and be ready for nothing. Was I really in a\
  \ taxi? Was I really on my way to the hostel? Did I really know what I was doing?\n\
  \nI know he would know. \n\nI was silent the whole journey, running through my plans\
  \ in my head. I had an extensive trip and in a few days\u2019 time I would be on\
  \ buses and trains up north and out of the city. I couldn\u2019t help but consider\
  \ the weather\u2026 it was a long way to come to be experiencing very British weather.\
  \ \n\nI sorry we argued. I\u2019m sorry that I shouted. \n\nOf course - the elections!\
  \ They were tonight: the 8th November 2015. The entire country would be driving\
  \ to the ballots tonight to cast their vote in what would be one of the most historic\
  \ elections with Aun Sang Suu Ki set to become the Prime Minister after years of\
  \ being under house arrest. I was witnessing history \u2013 not traffic\u2026 not\
  \ shouting \u2013 but excitement. \n\nBut what if the military intervene? Will I\
  \ be safe?\n\nI wish he could be here to see this. \n\nA further hour of rain and\
  \ car horns I reached my hostel. I thanked the driver and tipped him well \u2013\
  \ he had the patience of a saint to sit through all of that. \n\nSeveral flights\
  \ of stairs up a shabby concrete building with colorful paint peeling in the heat\
  \ and humidity, I reached a cool and calm flat. I was greeted by two friendly people\
  \ who guided me in and handed me some slippers. I seemed to be the only guest -\
  \ for now.\n\nI wonder what he would say right now?\n\nAs I entered I glanced around:\
  \ earlier revelers of the day\u2019s historic events had left the remnants of their\
  \ celebrations on a table in the corner. I started to think about having some food\
  \ and drink myself. \n\nI\u2019ll have a drink for him tonight. And for Myanmar.\n\
  \nI breathed a sigh of relief: I had made it. Here is to the start of a new adventure!\
  \ I suddenly heard a noise behind me I turned to find I was not the only visitor.\
  \ \n\n\u201CSo\u201D he said, \u201Cyou made it after all.\u201D"
