Text: "The noises in Pike\u2019s Place Market are like an explosion of colors. Voices,\
  \ violins, fish salesmen and bells, all beaming brightly, echo colors through the\
  \ market\u2019s twisting dimensions and sing a symphony of economy, tourism, and\
  \ music.\nThe Public Market Place sign is fluorescent.\nThe sun goes down and the\
  \ market sign lights up in a crisp and blooming red color, painting the uneven,\
  \ cobblestone street with distorted light that chases the shadows of patrons across\
  \ Pike Street.\nThe light is likened to Seattle\u2019s homing beacon, reverberating\
  \ restlessly to call people home from all directions. Tourists and students crawl\
  \ from the streets and sailors from the Puget Sound follow the light to their portside\
  \ resting place atop the pier downtown. \nVendors sell iron-on T-shirts and bouquets\
  \ of $5 tulips to strangers who have never been to America and neighbors who are\
  \ on their lunch break. Tourists and locals pass each other wordlessly, exchanging\
  \ space in the crowded street and tangling their thoughts in the surrounding air.\n\
  The din is composed of camera shutters and a myriad of languages. Babies let out\
  \ sleepy cries and tired feet carry them home. There are strollers and wheelchairs\
  \ and footsteps crossing every aisle.\nI can only focus when I am in a place such\
  \ as this. I am magnetized by the colors ribboning from each voice and every shop\
  \ hidden under layer after layer of cement.\nThere are people bumping into me and\
  \ eyes grazing over my frame, forgetting instead of seeing my face. I disappear\
  \ into the colors and the chaotic pulse. Sometimes we find our solace in the loudest\
  \ places, with meandering tourists ogling at the fish that tall, chubby men in white\
  \ aprons toss to their co-workers. I find myself in the decadent feeling of invisibility.\
  \ I am comfortable with the thought that I am completely unknown and unseen, able\
  \ to take the deepest breaths in the most congested street block in Seattle.\nI\
  \ am at home when I become one of the ever-changing, watercolor shades of the city\
  \ streets.\nMaybe when I lose myself in the smell of sticky puns, fresh fish, and\
  \ day old flowers I am most content because I find the wallflower inside of myself.\
  \ I find the part of me that flourishes in disarray and blooms in the vast expanse\
  \ of antiques and trinkets and street performers singing covers of Britney Spears\
  \ on their guitars and mandolins.\nSo I let the intoxicating ecosystem of vendors\
  \ and coffee shops transform me in the sound\u2013and in the color\u2013while bathing\
  \ in the fluorescent light."
