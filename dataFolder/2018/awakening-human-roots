Text: "I am still here. The dirt, the hunger, the pain, nothing had gone away. I look\
  \ at the canopy, I admire the magnificent rainforest. A squirrel monkey id sitting\
  \ on a branch above me and I remember the reason why I ended up here. The nature,\
  \ the beauty of every single detail, sounds and smells. \n\nI am so thankful to\
  \ get a glimpse of what the world was like before human touch. But at which cost?\
  \ I feel so weak, I have to give up. Or do I? Do the Huaoranis give up when their\
  \ land is stolen to oil exploration or when their homeland is destroyed because\
  \ of forest destruction? No, they fight! Fearless hunters, they know everything\
  \ about the richness of the planet, they treat it with respect. Me on the other\
  \ hand, I know nothing about it.\n\nYasun\xEC National Park, the Amazon, the deep\
  \ heart of Ecuador, the great adventure! I'm not a wild person, I always followed\
  \ the tracks humans created. I went to school, got a bachelor degree, found a job,\
  \ work long hours at a computer desk and took orders from people who made me feel\
  \ small. After awhile of this nonsense, life had no purpose. Until one day I realized\
  \ life could be more. I finally became a doer rather than a thinker. \n\nWhat more\
  \ radical decision than leaving everything behind and go anywhere I want to? I wanted\
  \ to see the world but not the way people always travel.  Quite rebellious I hear\
  \ you say! But what\u2019s the point in taking a plane, visit crowded cities, sleep\
  \ in hotel rooms and spend money in visits we \u201Chave\u201D to do? I was tired\
  \ of this \u201Cexpected\u201D traveling mode, it has become a sport, a competition,\
  \ a fashion. I wanted to feel alive through lifetime experiences not following trends.\n\
  \nI was curious of how people live around the world and I wanted to go back to basics,\
  \ test my resilience. This wilderness survival camp is the best thing that ever\
  \ happened to me even if it drives me insane. I started to regret my decision and\
  \ miss my old ridiculously comfortable life. \nBut a few miles away, in the same\
  \ forest, they are people who fight every day to live. What I\u2019m experiencing\
  \ at the moment, cold because I struggle to make fire without matches; hunger because\
  \ I failed at setting efficient traps to catch prey; that\u2019s the Huaoranis day-to-day\
  \ life. If they can\u2019t find food, they don\u2019t eat. If they don\u2019t cut\
  \ trees with their hands and handmade tools, they don\u2019t have homes. In addition\
  \ to this, their way of living is in jeopardy. I admire their fortitude. I'll go\
  \ on in my training to honor their heritage."
