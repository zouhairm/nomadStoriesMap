Text: "The city life is much real as it makes our self unreal. In a country like India\
  \ where people do run for western materialism still remains places where the individual\
  \ is unaware of anything other than her individual existence. Whether it's the scenic\
  \ natural landscape or the crowded metropolitan, there exists this individual. For\
  \ her demonitization or GST has as good a relevance as the banning of vegetarian\
  \ cuisine for a non vegeterian. \nThe world has changed since the advent of human\
  \ civilization but these Indian niches still remain the same. The conservatives\
  \ might flaunt it as an apt example and the poststructuralists might tag it as India's\
  \ failure to emerge as a developed nation; though this is the very human nature.\
  \ \nNorth of Bihar in the district of Khagaria is a small sparsely populated village\
  \ called Paura. The name means nothing so does the life of the villagers. Though\
  \ the land is semi arid but the flooding of the river Kosi brings in the alluvial\
  \ soil. The village situated on the bank of the sorrow of Bihar has no sorrow as\
  \ such. \nThe village is cut off from the district by a seven kilometre long road\
  \ which is eroded every monsoon. The caste system still prevails and child marriage\
  \ is the cultral norm. It might be the lack of awareness or the untraversable terrain\
  \ but this does not bothers the village folk. They are merry in their own manner.\
  \ Every dawn they wait for the dusk and every dusk they don't wait for the dawn\
  \ or maybe they do... who knows! \nIt's not that the village is not recognised by\
  \ the government of India rather it's their irrelevance that brings them this bounty\
  \ of aloofness. \nThe village people have no sense of bonohomie nor are they indulged\
  \ in village fights. For them the caste riots and class fights are a foreign affair.\
  \ The rich has enough to make his family meal the poor somehow manages to do so\
  \ too. Either it is the adamant social hierarchy prevailing or the absence of voiceferous\
  \ news channels that the live in inharmonious harmony.\nOne prominent site in the\
  \ village is the temple of Hindu diety Kali where the villagers sacrifice animals.\
  \ Near it stands the office of the village panchayat where men sit to play cards\
  \ at dusk.\nI couldn't understand whether it is a blessing in disguise or a conspicuous\
  \ curse. The people in there though seem glad. For the PM's visit to China or the\
  \ USA is same as him visiting Kenya. They don't care. Maybe it's because he doesn't\
  \ cares for them or maybe they don't want to be cared. Enigma....!!?"
