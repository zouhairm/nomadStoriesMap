Text: "New Zealand\u2019s summer sun beat against my singed shoulders as the Rocky\
  \ Mountain track terrain finally leveled off to reveal a sobering panorama. More\
  \ than 350 meters below me stretched the cool blue expanse of Lake Wanaka. The mountains\
  \ and glaciers of Mt. Aspiring National Park towered at my back. As I took in the\
  \ full capacity of my view, something I thought to be permanently dormant stirred\
  \ and provoked salty tears.\n\nThis hike marks one week into a South Island road\
  \ trip and four months into a jobless, countryless life stage. In the months before\
  \ leaving there were tears of a different nature accompanied by anger at my broken\
  \ body, frustration with doctors and panic from an overscheduled life.\n\nI\u2019\
  m not thinking of them now.\n\nWith a wet face and upward gaze I revolve to appreciate\
  \ my view, committing to memory the curve of every sun-baked hillside and glacial\
  \ river giving life to the lake. The afternoon sun animates creases, wrinkles and\
  \ fissures in the face of the Southern Alps. I can\u2019t help but feel a sense\
  \ of solidarity looking at the massive mountain range encouraged into existence\
  \ by major shifts in faultlines that I can\u2019t see but know are there. It reminds\
  \ me that change can be a painful and non-consensual process.\n\nMy throat is scratchy\
  \ with thirst as I absentmindedly sift dirt through my fingers. My feet ache. I\
  \ feel sweat soak my shirt. Above all, I feel joy and gratitude, though they\u2019\
  ve come at a price.\n\nI paid with presence on the ascent, where narrow paths with\
  \ steep drops required my full attention. I paid with patience as the persistent\
  \ wind pushed against me indifferently. I paid with memories of old suffering discarded\
  \ to create space for the glimpse of a falcon in effortless flight, or another iteration\
  \ of the same vista evolving with the light.\n\nIn the wake of my exhaustion from\
  \ the climb I realize how I\u2019ve not thought of my brokeness for some time. Instead,\
  \ I scan my second skin of mud, cuts and sandfly bites, recognizing myself more\
  \ as an appendage to the terrain than an accessory. A newfound intimacy with my\
  \ environment betrays what I\u2019ve been hiding: that joy and gratitude have been\
  \ casualties of my distrust in the shifting faultlines in my life for long enough.\n\
  \nIt has been four months since I boarded a one-way plane and even longer since\
  \ feeling this much hope. Sitting in the lap of nature against New Zealand's backdrop,\
  \ I don\u2019t dare question the timing of this resolve. Instead, I ease on my pack\
  \ and turn to the trail heading home."
