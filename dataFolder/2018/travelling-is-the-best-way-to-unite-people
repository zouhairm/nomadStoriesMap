Text: "Our land is our wealth. Nowadays people are busy with their own problems and\
  \ they don\u2019t see the beauty of our planet. No matter how many wars and natural\
  \ disasters happen all over the world the Earth still remains unbreakable.\nEvery\
  \ country is famous for its sights, which are worth visiting. As everyone I like\
  \ travelling.  Now I want to tell you my own story about the trip I had two years\
  \ ago. In 2016 I was lucky enough to receive a great opportunity going abroad.\n\
  Besides the university, I visit dancing classes. One day our dancing ensemble was\
  \ invited to the International Festival of natural dancing to India. The trip lasted\
  \ one week. We were pleasantly surprised to see so many mysterious places. One of\
  \ them was Taj Mahal. It was a great construction with a fascinating story. One\
  \ more magic place was Ak Shardaam. It was an interesting temple similar to a lotus.\
  \ It is difficult to describe the amazing sights of the country, that\u2019s why\
  \ it will be better to see everything by your eyes. People are very friendly there.\
  \ They extended a cordial welcome to us and liked our national dancing. \nTo sum\
  \ up the trip was unforgettable! It was very impressive to see and feel Indian lifestyle.\
  \ If I have one more chance I will be glad to visit this country again."
