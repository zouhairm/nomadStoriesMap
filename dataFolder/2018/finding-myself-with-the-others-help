Text: "I wanted to go to India. My friend decided to came with me. But, why only india\
  \ if we are making a long trip? We ear that Sri Lanka it\u2019s a paradise and as\
  \ I Chef I was curious to know what\u2019s around there.\nWallet, passport and phone\
  \ (we always checked that in all the cities where we stop) we\u2019re ready as well\
  \ as we were.\nFourth of January, the adventure starts. \nI dreamed about been next\
  \ to the locals and learn from them their culture and customs. \nSuddenly, when\
  \ we asked in a reception for a Tuktuk, this guy came. \nKumara was there for us\
  \ as he said. His English was not very good so we try to understand each other in\
  \ different ways, but the incredible from that it\u2019s that sometimes we finally\
  \ understand almost without words but our eyes. \nHe was \u201Calways ready\u201D\
  \ for everything. If we were hungry he\u2019ll find us a place to eat (local place,\
  \ nothing expensive), if he was driving the Tuktuk and we wanted to shoot one of\
  \ the amazing landscapes, he\u2019ll find the spot to do it. \nBut all of that was\
  \ just a small description of all that he gave to us. He offer us to go to his own\
  \ house, to have dinner which his wife will cook in a small old pot over a three\
  \ small sticks on fire. No privilege. Besides, there\u2019re even no windows.\n\
  He open his heart teaching us his values, Buddhist mainly. He was passionate of\
  \ teaching us his culture plus some life lessons. They see the world from a different\
  \ eyes than us, as they don\u2019t need all the gadgets that we do, they don\u2019\
  t need all the social-media that we always check. They see beyond that. \nOne day,\
  \ we land in his father in law House. A place I the middle of a huge tea plantation.\
  \ No disturbance, no horn,...no people around. That was the cherry on the top of\
  \ the cake. \nBeen there having a bucket shower or brushing my teeth\u2019s with\
  \ the water that came down through the hill was unforgettable. \n\nI can\u2019t\
  \ share all the fillings that I had for him as a human, but I can said two things\
  \ about him, thanks Kumara and I won\u2019t forget your lentils dhal. But I won\u2019\
  t neither forget  you and your family. \n\nI hope one day you can achive your goals\
  \ and send your daughter to the best school in Sigiriya. \n\nLove you my friend.\
  \ Keep been always ready !"
