Text: "I opened my eyes. A 5 year-old boy was there, crunching some peanuts. A tiny\
  \ bamboo basket full of roasted peanuts. Squatting in the corner of a locked door,\
  \ the golden sunbeams hit his forehead. The crumple sand coloured pyjama dotted\
  \ with little camels looked a trompe l\u2019oeil against the wall of sun dried clay\
  \ bricks. He wasn't bothered by my presence, completely absorbed in his task.\n\
  Four months earlier I wouldn't bet on this: meeting that Burmese boy. I closed my\
  \ eyes. \n\nWe were sitting on the stairs of Merlion Park, Ravi and I, holding a\
  \ cream and a chocolate cone respectively. Herds of tourists trotting around armed\
  \ with selfie sticks, trying to figure out which was their best side for a picture\
  \ with the marble fountain. Ice cold water drops, or what I imagined to be in a\
  \ sticky summer night, hit my left shoulder.\nHis permanent smile, the two small\
  \ lines below his lower lips, like wrinkles of happiness. I could see and feel what\
  \ he was telling me, I saw unknown landscapes, amazing people surrounded by magical\
  \ vibes. Everything I could wish for was right there, waiting for me. I closed my\
  \ eyes and it looked like an illustrated book. His words were literally spilling\
  \ out of his mouth, flowing around. Creating step by step a temple, with high pinnacles\
  \ and an inaccessible tower, a mom wrapped in her glowing pink lungi, her youngest\
  \ child held in her arms and the two elder brothers were chasing each other in the\
  \ dusty soil. \n\nI opened my eyes. The little boy was there, still there. For real.\
  \ I felt blessed. \nRavi sent me a picture he took that time, his first time in\
  \ Bagan. Four years passed but the small boy safely held in her mother's lap, was\
  \ right in front of me. I couldn't mistaken. His smooth forehead, the liquid brown\
  \ eyes like his mother.\nI waved at him. - Hi -\nI did not expect a reaction. He\
  \ couldn't understand English.\nI came closer, he wasn't afraid. Myanmar is not\
  \ anymore an off the beaten track country, he was used to see stranger\u2019s faces.\
  \ \nAs quick as I could I pulled out that photo and lowered to him. A gasp followed.\
  \ He pointed his short salty finger towards the screen and back to him. \nThe boy\
  \ uttered a word I couldn't understand, it sounded like - Me - and offered some\
  \ peanuts.\nHe recognized himself in that picture. A smile appeared on his face,\
  \ a big one, not only his lips had an half moon shape, his eyes became small needle\
  \ heads.\n\nThe joy I felt in that moment, something I couldn't even pictured few\
  \ months before, was worth coming all the way long."
