Text: Last year i visited a Uruguayan city that has a international board with Brazil,
  this city was Rivera in Uruguay and Santa do Libramento- RS in Brazil.  In this
  cities exist just a street that divide the two countries( it`s so cool), you cross
  the street and you are in Brazil or in Uruguay. Was the first that i travel so far
  and by plane. The most interesting is that how diferentes was the Cities and at
  the same time you can see the singularities of each one. When i arrived at this
  place in was revived by some relatives that were living there, and i think that
  this add more `` the local culture`` for my trip. they shown me all the tourists
  places , first in the Brazilian City and than in the Uruguayan city, and was amazing.
  There was many restaurants, free shops and wineries . Plus,in this specially region
  day eat so much barbecue and drink wine , the caramelo candy is Delicious too. Passed
  two days that i eas there , i decided to went a walk away at the city , i talked
  with the citizens on the street ( Brazilian was more Friendly than Uruguayan most
  of the time, but i think too many Uruguayan  polites) , visit some museums and doing
  this i was feeling the cities lives . Sometimes i was confused because i do not
  know if i was in Brazil or in Uruguay ( was so funny).  I repeated this things during
  the seven days that i spent there, was amazing and i would like to try this Experience
  again.
