Text: "I had long romanticized Cuba, enamored by the idea of a rebellious island trapped\
  \ in time. Countries resistant to imperialism intrigue me, and I was looking forward\
  \ to seeing a place only 90 miles away from the US, yet unscathed by the western\
  \ world.  I\u2019d known Cuba to be controversial, a rebel in a constant state of\
  \ revolution--initially from Spain, then from dictator Batista, and now, one could\
  \ say from Castro\u2019s socialist regime. But I also imagined that it would be\
  \ pure, soulful, and taboo...making it that much more alluring. Never really the\
  \ type for resorts, I wanted to see and experience the real Cuba, and avoid most\
  \ tourists cliches. I chose a \u201Ccasa particular\u201D over a hotel, which entails\
  \ being hosted by a local family, but is the equivalent of a B&B. After departing\
  \ the US, we soon flew beyond the Florida Keys, and I was amazed by how quickly\
  \ thereafter the Cuban coastline and countryside appeared below, sparsely populated\
  \ with homes that immediately relay the poverty of the country and the heart of\
  \ the people.  Two minutes later, we were landing, passing through customs, changing\
  \ money, securing wifi cards, and on our way to the casa. Our host Aymee was a gem--an\
  \ invaluable concierge. She was eager to provide insight into Cuban culture and\
  \ politics over breakfast, as well as provide tips on restaurants, nightlife and\
  \ cultural faux paus (nothing offends the locals more than blowing your nose in\
  \ public). The casa was centrally located, across from the towering steps of the\
  \ university, walking distance to La Rampa, a popular collegiate area, as well as\
  \ the Malecon, Havana\u2019s socio-political trademark and a social scene for millennials.\
  \ Aymee recommended that we take a day trip to Varadero to celebrate my birthday.\
  \  It proved to be the most enchanting beach I\u2019ve ever visited.  There, I met\
  \ God, and she was indeed a woman, and her name was Yemaya. Entranced by the fade\
  \ of the horizon into the warm water, the various blues and their subtle gradient\
  \ out to sea, the gentle breeze--I waded for a half mile before reclining in the\
  \ waist-deep water and gazing up at the sky. Unbeknownst to me, it was also the\
  \ birthday of Jose Marti, and each year, Cuba celebrates with the March of Torches.\
  \ We returned to the casa to find thousands of Cubans on the steps of the university,\
  \ led by the president, lighting torches and marching down the main thoroughfare.\
  \ The unity, resilience and power was incredible to witness as we watched from the\
  \ balcony.  Viva la revolucion!"
