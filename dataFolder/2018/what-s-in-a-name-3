Text: "I am at the Bali airport and waiting for the taxi driver. He comes and we greet\
  \ each other , \nMe : Hi I am Neha from India \nHim : I am Wayang , welcome to Bali\
  \ !\nHe drives me to my guest house in Ubud. \nAt Kenari guest house , my host welcomes\
  \ me :\nHost: I am Ketut, she is my wife Komang & that's our daughter and she is\
  \ Ketut, my daughter's friend.\nMe : (confused how can they both be Ketut) Hello\
  \ all , I am Neha. Lovely to meet you guys!! But anyway what's in a name? So I ignore\n\
  Later that evening , I go to a cafe \nWaiter : (nameplate reads I Wayan) Hello ma'm,\
  \ your order please ?\nMe : One cafe latte\nAnd I think of the driver who also was\
  \ Wayan. So I start checking the namplates of other waiters there, one of female\
  \ waitress nameplate reads Ni Ketut. One more Ketut ?\nThe next day I book a cab\
  \ to go to Seminyak , I ask Ketut , my host ,for a driver's number and he texts\
  \ me Wayan's number and I am like what a coincidence , the same driver from yesterday\
  \ !! And I get excited about it. I tell Ketut & he has a good laugh  and says\n\
  Ketut : No No , he not same driver , he a different driver. \nAnd so I had to ask\
  \ him , why they all have the same names then ?\nSo he explains me the history behind\
  \ Balinese names. He says In Bali , everything is in order.\nFirst child: Wayan\
  \ , second child: Made ,third Child: Komang ,fourth Child: Ketut. And 5th child\
  \ onwards the cycle repeats.\nThe males have 'I' before their name and the females\
  \ have 'Ni' before their names.\nThese are family names , people also have personal\
  \ names , but usually when they introduce themselves they use family names , for\
  \ eg. I Wayan or Ketut or Komang whatever.And I am like seriously ??  That's weirdly\
  \ interesting .\nSo then I greet him again and I tell him , Ni Made and we share\
  \ a good laugh.\nAfter this moment , whoever I met, greeted in Bali they all looked\
  \ like family, it felt I already know them now.Gradually I started following their\
  \ rituals for the next 7 days & felt this connect as if I have always lived here\
  \ and known them for years together.\nAfter coming back to my country, I have been\
  \ introducing myself as Made & telling everyone the history of Balinese names and\
  \ everytime I do this I think of this conversation and it brings a big smile on\
  \ my face. I am back now but still in touch with Komang and Ketut , my hosts, have\
  \ chats/exchange msgs on fb and I really want them to come to India once so I can\
  \ host them and make them feel at home. Give them back the happiness, the love they\
  \ showered on me."
