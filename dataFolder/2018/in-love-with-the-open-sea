Text: "Working up an appetite for the wilderness beneath the waves.\n\nI looked down,\
  \ vast ocean surrounding me. Despite a crew behind on board, I felt alone. Finally,\
  \ I jumped off the edge into the waves, nothing but blue visible underneath the\
  \ surface. \n\nVisiting the Great Barrier Reef in Australia is akin to being in\
  \ another world. The cool breeze, or turbulent waves on this day, take you to another\
  \ realm. As soon as I hit the water, it hit me how small a creature I was. \n\n\
  I battled through strong currents to my destination, Turtle Bay in the outer reef.\
  \ The boat stopped several metres short of this, where nothing underwater was distinguishable\
  \ except the liquid itself. This left me feeling exposed, but this was all part\
  \ of the adventure. \n\nSoon, I came upon the coral reef, like a lens coming into\
  \ focus. I saw a diverse ecosystem containing such weird and wonderful beings. I\
  \ quickly forgot about the strong winds, and was immersed in a new world entirely.\
  \ Coral trout, butterfly fish, turtles, sharks \u2013 a colourful biosphere.\n \n\
  This world below the surface was indisputably remarkable. In touching distance of\
  \ wildlife so dissimilar to anything I knew, I was curious to learn about thousands\
  \ upon thousands of mysterious species that until that instant, were unknown to\
  \ me. \n\nHours passed in mere seconds and we were being called back up to the surface.\
  \ \n\nUltimately, I hadn\u2019t anticipated being so comfortable in the ocean, and\
  \ being so sad to leave what I had always considered unsafe \u2013 high seas in\
  \ no sight of land. Though travelling, I had journeyed into myself.\n\nThe importance\
  \ of saving corals dawned on me in a new light. \n\nNever before had I truly understood\
  \ what the world was in risk of losing \u2013 despite always being environmentally\
  \ conscious. I did not appreciate the catastrophic knock-on effects this could take\
  \ until I witnessed this beautiful landscape myself. Although I was almost half-way\
  \ through a four-month exploration, I felt like the adventure had just begun. \n\
  \nBack in the safety of the craft, I conversed with other travellers like me, bonding\
  \ over a shared love of voyage, wine, cheese, and the unexpected. \n\n\u201CYou\
  \ forget about everything else, every single time it\u2019s been different,\u201D\
  \ the photographer said to me. This was everyday life for him. However, he was as\
  \ excited as anyone to get in the water. \n\nI folded my stinger suit and fins,\
  \ knowing I would return one day. Here I was, the other ends of the world from home;\
  \ unaided and cold, and yet it was peaceful, welcoming, and serene."
