Text: "Namibia is comprised of one immense, visually-stunning landscape after another.\
  \ In January 2018, a friend and I drove 3,329 kilometers across the country, in\
  \ 40 hours spanning 8 days, starting from the South African border at Vioolsdrif,\
  \ and stopping along the detour-laden way to Windhoek in Luderitz, Kolmanskop, Sossusvlei,\
  \ Walvis Bay, Swakopmund, Damaraland, and the desolate Skeleton Coast. What we saw\
  \ at every turn defied comprehension, as vast grassy savannas fell into deep canyons,\
  \ which opened into barren sandy flatlands, and then meandered through towering\
  \ dunes, all the while serving as the backdrop for oryx, ostriches, zebra, springbok,\
  \ giraffes, and eland grazing alongside the road. At moments, we felt like we were\
  \ in a well-photoshopped poster; at other times we felt like we had stumbled onto\
  \ Mars, with expansive red-sand deserts punctuated by solitary rock mountains dozens\
  \ of kilometers in the distance.\n\nYet, we would have missed this all had we not\
  \ decided to rent and drive\u2014a decision we didn\u2019t take lightly. We\u2019\
  d heard that driving could be tedious and risky, but flying defeated the purpose\
  \ of visiting Namibia in the first place: to see it\u2019s landscape. However, it\
  \ was a decision that got us two punctured tires and an afternoon spent axle-deep\
  \ in three feet of desert sand. Namibia\u2019s highway system is simple, with letters\
  \ from A to F. While A and B roads are paved, the rest are either gravel or dirt,\
  \ with a healthy dose of sharp rocks. Three days in, I was forced by a flat tire\
  \ to venture into the blazing desert heat, creeping headfirst under the tailgate,\
  \ rolling around in the dust to position the jack in just the right spot. And again\
  \ two days later to change another. And again that same day, to dig (for two hours)\
  \ a path for our well-sunken 4x4 out of the sand.\n\nDrivers in Namibia quickly\
  \ learn an unwritten but wonderfully courteous rule when spotting someone on the\
  \ side of the road: slow your car, roll down the window, and ask with a tentative\
  \ thumbs-up, \u201CYou all set?\u201D to make sure they don't need a lift to the\
  \ nearest town. It all sounds quite civilized, but the risk is real\u2014in our\
  \ journey, we crossed deserts for hours and at times up to 400km without encountering\
  \ a soul. But in the end, this is what travel\u2019s all about\u2014for these moments\
  \ that humble. It was worth the minimal risk and the journey to the edge of my comfort\
  \ zone, for the humility it gave me as a human being, with a borrowed speck of time\
  \ and space on this vast, ancient planet."
