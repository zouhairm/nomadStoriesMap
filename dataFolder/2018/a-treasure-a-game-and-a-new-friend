Text: "The Snaefellsness peninsula in Iceland is a visually stunning place, starkly\
  \ beautiful in its isolation. Traversing moss covered lava fields across a treeless\
  \ landscape, one can travel for hours without seeing another person. Against this\
  \ backdrop we pulled off on a side road to photograph a farmhouse next to a glacial\
  \ blue stream. After exiting our Jeep we were approached by a local dog, barking\
  \ and wagging its tail excitedly. It's slightly hunched over posture and two different\
  \ colored eyes left me with an uneasy feeling as we warily sized each other up.\
  \ Suddenly it took off, sprinting down a trail, crossing a bridge and up into the\
  \ rocky hills. Somewhat puzzled we went about photographing the scene. After a minute\
  \ or so we see off in the distance the dog retracing it's steps, racing back towards\
  \ us. As it gets closer we see it's carrying something in its mouth and when it\
  \ gets a few feet away we see what the object is.  A stick! A well worn, tooth marked\
  \ stick. It was as if, in this barren land, this ragged chunk of wood was a golden\
  \ treasure, worthy of being stashed high up in a secret rocky vault. Not wasting\
  \ an opportunity to engage with the rare stranger, the dog dropped the stick before\
  \ me. It was time to play! The dog would eagerly chase the stick and return, yipping\
  \ and prancing with excitement. After several minutes of this impromptu game of\
  \ fetch it was clear that this could go on forever and I told my buddy to go start\
  \ the Jeep. With one final heave I threw the stick as far as I could and jumped\
  \ in the open door. As we were driving away down the gravel road I was a little\
  \ sad to see the dog running along side with the stick, looking at me as if to say\
  \ c\u2019mon let's play some more! However I took comfort in knowing that I had\
  \ made a local connection and confident that the dog has returned its treasure to\
  \ its hiding place, waiting for the next visitor."
