Text: "The last thing I expected was love. I was loved but I never loved. I never\
  \ felt it. It was too complex for me and too \"easy\" for others. The complexity\
  \ of love is that it's such an easy concept. People make it look hard, almost impossible\
  \ to obtain. But it is not. My first love was a bellezza Italiano complex of beach\
  \ and the balance of the new houses and the ruined houses. Since then I found out\
  \ that my ideal temperature of living my ways was the Mediterranean one. I just\
  \ loved Mediterranean Sea, climate and landscapes. But after falling in love with\
  \ one country I realized my first love was another. My original one,\n\n       \
  \                                                                              \
  \  R   O   M   A   N   I   A\n\n\nBut it is the first loved country where I was\
  \ hurt so bad that my wish for traveling almost became and obsession. Being obsessive\
  \ over something is a sign of schizophrenia and my way of treating it was to go\
  \ extreme over the thing I desired. The unexpectedness led me to a portal of western\
  \ education and for me meant the world of the outside, where I think I will find\
  \ other people like me, people of different cultures that I have so much to learn\
  \ from, not just about their countries, but their personalities, their method of\
  \ tackling the senses of life. As I am as a person, I just love supporting humanity\
  \ and ways of understanding. I loved how to be challenged to understand such a complex\
  \ thing like ethnology and religion. \nI have realized one thing: wherever in this\
  \ world I would be traveling, meeting people, learn, I would always think about\
  \ that the person I am today is made by my country. It taught me how to think beyond\
  \ the boundaries, it taught me patriotism, selection among people and it showed\
  \ me who I really want to be. On the other side there is my formation country\n\n\
  \nU N I \n           T  E  D \n\n                                              \
  \      K   I   N   G   D   O   M\n\n\nwhich led me to find myself a more practical\
  \ being: the interaction with my future. My future is based on the bachelor degree\
  \ of Interior Architecture and Design at the University of Suffolk. From the person\
  \ that just believed into the infinity of this Universe that I used once to contemplate\
  \ about, to the person who corresponds to the criticality of the environment and\
  \ individual's rights of being. You see, traveling is not about to experience luxury\
  \ of the materiality, but it is about to keep your heart tolerating with love."
