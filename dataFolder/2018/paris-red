Text: "He took to polluting the world with his fowl language and ungrateful stench.\
  \ It was precisely 7:00am and the sun was just touching the horizon. This nuisance\
  \ just had to be on my flight. He was that one unruly passenger and he had no issue\
  \ causing a fuss. He took to waking everyone up with his noisy complaints and ill\
  \ temper. Luckily, we were all just a few minutes from our destination, Paris! It\
  \ was November of 2015.\n\n I had been studying for the past 3 months in England.\
  \ I was scheduled to venture to Paris with my friends Connor & Joseph. Much to my\
  \ dismay Joseph cancelled on me last minute and Connor had an exam that he needed\
  \ to study for so he wouldn't arrive until Friday. I, however, had a routine. I\
  \ was done with classes by Wednesday at 3:00pm. I would catch a bus to London on\
  \ Wednesday evening and be out of the country by Thursday morning. This had become\
  \ my ritual. Every two weeks a different country and this week was France. To save\
  \ on flights I found a willing man on the app, Couchsurf to accommodate me for the\
  \ weekend. \n\nHe worked during the day and escorted \"Little me around Paree\"\
  \ at night. That Friday while waiting for Connor to arrive I ventured out into the\
  \ city. I walked about 40 minutes from Place de la Republique to the Louv. And then\
  \ another 40 minutes to the Eiffel tower, shining in the distance. I was awe struck!\
  \ Wandering through the streets buying freshly baked bread and petite souvenirs.\
  \ Life was but a dream or so I thought. \n\nAs I arrived back at the square I met\
  \ my host on the street, he was putting me up in a hostel for the night because\
  \ his parents were in town. He paid for my room and scurried out the building. I\
  \ took a seat in a dusty corner to charge my phone a bit. I was minutes from walking\
  \ out the door in search of McDonalds (typical tourist) when the lights went off.There\
  \ was screaming and yelling. You could hear shots and cries throughout the street.We\
  \ were told to go to our rooms and lock the door for terrorist had overtaken Paris."
