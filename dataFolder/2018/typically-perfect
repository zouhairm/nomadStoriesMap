Text: "I was lying on a flat bunk in a dimly lit room. Uncomfortably, I\u2019d propped\
  \ up my torso on my elbows, pen and notebook in hand, and was surveying the room.\
  \ \n\nUlaanbaatar is the capital of Mongolia, and I\u2019d wanted to trek through\
  \ the country on horseback and be swept into the Gobi desert. Deserts seem to offer\
  \ nothing but death, ruthlessly drying the sojourner's hope for survival. Paradoxically,\
  \ the wind of history blows the words of beautiful, colorful\u2014mysterious\u2014\
  people, earth. The crazy man who courts the desert does so not despite fear, but\
  \ for love of it.  \n\nI would set South tomorrow. My mind swam, drowned maybe,\
  \ in the moment. Far from home, in a city that my friends couldn\u2019t spell, alone\
  \ again, with youthful naivety primed for a quest, now, in this room, at this time,\
  \ I acknowledged the momentous implication of my circumstance: If I put pen to paper,\
  \ if ink was pressed onto page by my hand, now, it would be masterful. I was ready\
  \ for this moment, I knew it was coming\u2014not only because every traveler who\
  \ finds himself up late in a foreign and quiet room is wise\u2014but because, as\
  \ a traveler, my unique mindset provides passage into a world of wisdom reserved\
  \ only for the daring and the conceited. \n\nThe world is imperfect: In typical\
  \ of moments like these, I had to repeatedly reassure myself of my uniqueness, knowing\
  \ another man was also writing a supposed masterpiece in the bunk just above me.\
  \ Despite triumphing against this distraction, I was then surprised to learn that\
  \ the wide-framed woman, sleeping on her side on the bottom bunk on the other side\
  \ of the room, was undergoing a nocturnal battle with her dinner. Taming her stomach\
  \ every half an hour or so with chocolate, I\u2019d become accustomed to seeing\
  \ her roll-over in bed toward the center of the room around which the bunk beds\
  \ were positioned, open her eyes ever so slightly, and reach into a loud plastic\
  \ bag of stomach-settling treats which she would then eat as if she had an unlimited\
  \ supply. For whatever reason, the chocolate was not helping her stomach as well\
  \ as it was meant to, and she began to release loud baritone fecal fumes into what\
  \ limited supply of air our small room could possibly offer. This was enough, I\
  \ ruminated, to rouse one out of the state of mind in which masterpieces could be\
  \ made. The perfection so necessary for my traveler\u2019s experience to be truly\
  \ significant eluded me, and was puffed further and further away with every subsequent,\
  \ unapologetic, sounding of the ass trumpet."
