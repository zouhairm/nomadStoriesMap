Text: "In complete exhaustion, I laid down in the tent I\u2019d pitched under a palm\
  \ tree. We were in Nakhlestan, \u201Cland of the palms\u201D, an abandoned garden\
  \ on the sparsely populated island of Hengam, right at the mouth of the Strait of\
  \ Hormuz. Who knows what hour of night it could be on this island lost in \u201C\
  Time\u201D? \n Suddenly a voice erupted from outside my tent, \u201CAh! Come and\
  \ see! There\u2019s a hedgehog!\u201D We scrambled from our tents, rushing to catch\
  \ a glimpse of the elusive little beast. But the friend who\u2019d called us, being\
  \ the most sensitive soul of us all, had unwittingly sealed a terrible fate for\
  \ this adorable creature. Hedgehogs, juje tighi in the local language, are known\
  \ for their poor eyesight. The rush of bodies toward him had sent him fleeing. A\
  \ sound of weight plopping into water broke the silence of the night. In his frenzied\
  \ blindness, our new friend had fallen into an ancient well. \n Our hearts dropped,\
  \ but we soon learned hedgehogs can swim. His tiny feet paddled in circles looking\
  \ for a way up. We couldn\u2019t forgive ourselves. We quickly began to gather fallen\
  \ palm branches and fasten them together, hoping to offer a way for the little one\
  \ to climb out. Lowering the makeshift rescue ladder into the well, we saw that\
  \ he had found a place to hang on to and rest, but couldn\u2019t understand how\
  \ to climb out himself.\n After hours of worry and rescue attempts to no avail,\
  \ we sat exhausted. We\u2019d sacrificed all the ropes holding our camp together,\
  \ and now we decided to give our only cooking pot to the cause. We lowered the pot\
  \ with a meal of tuna into the disgusting old well, and hoped he\u2019d at least\
  \ have a meal and gain the energy to climb out.\n The next day, \u201CJuje\u201D\
  \ was there, far more exhausted than ourselves. After many more rescue attempts,\
  \ we had to accept there was nothing we could do. Our guilt ran deep. We sat around\
  \ the fire, saying words to honor the magical little creature who\u2019d taught\
  \ us such a profound lesson. We made jokes and laughed to try to shake off the finality\
  \ of the mistake we\u2019d made. \n The locals were amused by our extreme efforts,\
  \ but appreciated our attempts at preserving the ever-so-vulnerable wildlife of\
  \ the island. Weeks later, the story had circulated and by the time one of our crew\
  \ had returned to the cursed well, the little hedgehog had become a legend. The\
  \ old, polluted well had been transformed. There\u2019s not a time one can visit\
  \ this place without paying respects to the spirit of the little teacher at the\
  \ bottom of the wishing well."
