Text: "I clutch my winter coat tightly around me, grateful I'd thought to bring it.\
  \ It's cold in the dark of the desert away from the city lights. I stand mesmerized,\
  \ watching the huge canvas ripple and swell with flames erupting from the gas canisters.\
  \ \n\nMen in khaki overalls dart around the flailing balloon as it grows glowing\
  \ in the darkness, lashing it down with ropes like they\u2019re battling Moby Dick.\
  \ They bark orders incoherently, their words lost in the intermittent roar of the\
  \ flames. One distinctive voice rings out abrasively in the desert dawn.\n\n\u201C\
  GOOOOD MOE-NIN! What time is it? 4.30 in the moe-nin! Me an my boy shaun are about\
  \ to hop on this air balloon. I\u2019m cold, I\u2019m excited, this is guna be ridiculous\
  \ yall! Shaun is about to pee his pants!\u201D\n\nI begrudgingly break my gaze wanting\
  \ to know who is causing such a commotion. A bald guy dressed in an ornately embroidered\
  \ silk bomber jacket and expensive sunglasses bounces up and down, excitedly narrating\
  \ to a man holding a camera.\n\n\u201CI\u2019m Moe Money, the UAE\u2019s hottest\
  \ vlogger!\u201D He spouts animatedly, bouncing from one foot to the other. \u201C\
  Join me on my journey as we go hot air ballooning over the Dubai desert. It\u2019\
  s guna be insane!\u201D\n\nThe ascent is fast, like watching a video zoom out on\
  \ a widescreen TV. The points of reference shrink in an instant, swallowed by the\
  \ bigger picture. The first rays of the day pierce the heavy set cloud sitting on\
  \ the Oman mountains on the horizon. From an altitude of 10,000ft the dunes are\
  \ ripples, like the ones beneath your feet when the tide retreats. It\u2019s sparse,\
  \ vast and beautiful.\n\n\u201CSo we got my guy Bomber here,\u201D Moe drawls to\
  \ the camera, gesturing to the falcon perched on the glove of her handler who introduces\
  \ himself as Dillan. He impatiently requests the Chinese group listen. The incessant\
  \ shutter snap of their camera phones ceases temporarily.  \n\nHe explains how the\
  \ Bedouin have a deep appreciation for falconry. An elegant bird of prey and emblem\
  \ of national pride, often costing more than the supercars congesting Dubai\u2019\
  s highways. She flys a loop around the balloon, returning for a reward of raw guinea\
  \ fowl. I notice a transmitter on her back blink.\n\nThe sun burns away the cloud,\
  \ light dappling huge swathes of desert. I\u2019m finally warming through. My thoughts\
  \ drift as we do, gliding on the breeze at the mercy of the wind. A familiar voice\
  \ brings me back to earth with a bump.\n\n\u201CTime to get in the landing position!\u201D\
  \ Moe yells into the camera. \u201CHold on tight and don\u2019t forget to subscribe!\u201D"
