Text: "Early morning waking up on the cruise ship in the beautiful \u201Cgreenhouse\u201D\
  \ of the Amazon rainforest. The morning is fresh and clear and I am rewarded with\
  \ a short and unforgettable moment of complete peace. Inhaling the pure air, observing\
  \ the line between the river and the lush forest being smudged by the flying movements\
  \ of the macaws and other tropical birds. Moments after, we continue the trip only\
  \ to soon stop again to get ashore using the small canoes, just like the ones the\
  \ locals use to travel on the Amazon river. Waiting for us is a group of indigenous\
  \ people from a local tribe. We climb a small hill and are guided through the dense\
  \ rainforest by a young man. Arriving at a glade we are welcomed by the Chief of\
  \ the tribe named \u201CThe Big Snake\u201D, dressed in a colourful and ceremonial\
  \ outfit including headgear like a real Indian Chief. Present are also some of his\
  \ extended family members and one of them, we later learn, is his beautiful daughter\
  \ Yara. The encounter with the tribe is short but intense, their stories touching\
  \ and their culture fascinating. I speak with them in Portuguese about simple things,\
  \ trying to connect our completely different worlds with a supposed common humanity\
  \ and for me it works, I feel connected to them and it seems like they at least\
  \ enjoy our simple conversation as well. The experience is strong and almost overwhelming\
  \ and I feel lucky for this rare magical moment. Back in the cruise ship the most\
  \ touching story is revealed by our guide. Yara, the 18 years old daughter of the\
  \ Chief, have expressed the wish to study at the university in the nearby town to\
  \ help to improve the life situation for the tribe. However, being an indigenous\
  \ she needs to have a non- indigenous person assuming the responsibility for her\
  \ while she is in town away from the tribe. The Chief has asked the guide for help,\
  \ but the guide is a man and is travelling all the time in his profession, so he\
  \ is not a good choice and the responsibility is huge so it is difficult to find\
  \ somebody to trust in for this important mission. So, for the time being, Yara\u2019\
  s dream is on hold. I wish I could have done something to help so that Yara would\
  \ remember me just as I remember her and the moment spent with the tribe. We are\
  \ all humans, but our conditions are sometimes far too different and not always\
  \ fair. Next day in the beautiful sunset the cruise ended in the town where Yara\
  \ one day will study and realize her dreams. At least this is my strong wish!"
