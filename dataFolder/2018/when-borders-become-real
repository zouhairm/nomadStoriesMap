Text: "On July 3, 2017 Russian border forces in contested area in northeast Georgia\
  \ adjusted their position, and in doing so gobbled up 700 meters more of Georgian\
  \ territory.\nThe next day, blissfully oblivious, I flew to Tbilisi.\nIn Tbilisi,\
  \ I fell in love with Georgia's strange hybrid of Europe and Asia, nature and cosmopolitanism.\
  \ Soon, I managed to negotiate my way onto a Marshrutka, travel to the tiny mountain\
  \ village of Stepantsminda. Flanked by the foothills of Mt Kazbek, Stepantsminda\
  \ is packed to the brim with Georgian charm and hospitality, but is not yet a hub\
  \ for tourists. Locals have not grown weary of failed attempts to master Georgian,\
  \ nor are they tired of making recommendations to visitors.\nI was recommended Truso\
  \ Valley, which would be one of the most magnificent hikes of my life. I meandered\
  \ through the valley, cut across gem-colored mineral pools, and explored a tangle\
  \ of ruins now half-occupied. Fields of wildflowers were stippled with grazing cows.\
  \ The few residents of the valley flew by on horseback. It was like another world.\n\
  After three hours of take-your-breath-away beauty, that I came to the border. I\
  \ had been warned ahead of time of the patrol. If you look at a map of Georgia's\
  \ Truso Valley and zoom in, you will see that it isn't at, or even close to, the\
  \ official Russo-Georgian border. Yet here he was, a guard with Russian livery,\
  \ carrying a Kalashnikov and pacing back and forth along the dirt road. High on\
  \ the hill behind him were the ruins of the Zakagori fortress. \nZakagori fortress\
  \ is a beautiful place to explore and, if you ask nicely, the border guards can\
  \ be persuaded to give you fifteen minutes to climb up. I had just enough time to\
  \ snap a few pictures before scurrying back down to the trail, nodding in appreciation\
  \ to the border guard, and turning back to catch my ride.\nIt was only after I flew\
  \ home that I saw the news of the Russian intrusion on Georgian territory. Initially,\
  \ 700 meters didn't seem like much, but then I thought of Stepantsminda, a mere\
  \ dozen kilometers east of the border to South Ossetia, the site of the 2008 Russo-Georgian\
  \ War. I thought of the Truso Valley, the Zakagori fortress, and the tiny farms\
  \ that dotted the landscape. Finally, I thought of the gruff border guard, who granted\
  \ leniency to tourists, but might not do the same for residents. The news of the\
  \ land grab cast a new light on my day in Truso Valley and made me consider how\
  \ the shadow of conflict can fall even in the most beautiful of places."
