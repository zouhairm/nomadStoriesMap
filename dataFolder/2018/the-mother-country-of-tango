Text: "A smart decision that I made to get away from my city and country plus I never\
  \ been out of my country before so you can say is a out of my mind to do this but\
  \ I am looking for a great new experience and love. Ever since I as younger, around\
  \ 11 or 12 years of age I remember obsessively growing with this idea that Argentina\
  \ is the most romantic place in the world and that I one day I would go and find\
  \ my true love dancing Tango. Right! I know is very cheesy to think like this till\
  \ this day now that I\u2019m 26 years of ok but the heart of a child is still awake\
  \ in me. Still with this fantasy dream leaving in me I want to make it come true\
  \ and go to Argentina explore meet new places and people go dance tango and find\
  \ my true love in the city. Is just like a feeling that you get in your guts that\
  \ this is your destiny and you have to make it come true and it will happen no matter\
  \ what but you also have to put effort on your dream to come true it just doesn\u2019\
  t come that easy in a blink of an eye. But this is just a step to it and I will\
  \ cheerish every slinge of it even if I don\u2019t have a true love don\u2019t matter\
  \ because at the end I made myself happy by achieving this amazing trip to Argentina."
