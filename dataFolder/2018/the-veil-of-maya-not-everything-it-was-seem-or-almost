Text: "I was a novist archeologist when I had the opportunity to visit, what was the\
  \ Kingdom of Cyrus, Darius and Xerxes. During my trip I kept a diary. I wanted \
  \ to forget nothing of my visit, because  for me it was like exploring another world\
  \ that I knew only by TV. \nWhen I arrived in Theran the first thing that hit me\
  \ was: the pitcure of the ayatollah wich helped to give an sinister look, and the\
  \ clothes. We were forced by  our anxious  Iranian archeology teachers  to dress\
  \ with long clothes which recovered our body.  But it was walking in the street\
  \ of Theran I discovered that Iranian girls were different: they were wearing coloured\
  \ clothes wich showed the contours of the body, with enormous trendy sunglasses.\
  \ Everyone, girls both in the city and in the country, were amazed by our nun-type\
  \ clothes. It was very strange and funny. That was only the beginning; they were\
  \ many other things-good and bad wich  amazed me, during my visit. Too many to write\
  \ everything.\nUnforgettable for me was everything from the meeting with  archeologist\
  \ girls  to the  teaching methods  and excavations  in Kermansha, where  the girls\
  \ said that they change and normality. Then a casual invitation to a wedding  reception,\
  \ at the  hotel where we were staying: the curiosity  of people, especially women;\
  \ the kindness of our drivers who when  they found out it was my birthday, got angry\
  \ because I had said nothing, then they happily bought a pie. They cried  when we\
  \ left! But, I couldn\u2019t  forget the schizofrenia of the nation, based on what\
  \ the girls told me and on what  I could acknowledge. The absurdity not to be able\
  \ to use the lift  if, by chance, there is a  man  with you ( this happend to me),\
  \ or when I visited a site in the  mountain and I was reproached because my veil\
  \ didin\u2019t resist the force of gravity or wind, revealing my red hair instead\
  \ of helping me. I\u2019m afraid heights.\nI don\u2019t know why, but although many\
  \ years have passed I remain attached at this country sentimentally, even if I haven\u2019\
  t got  blood ties, I don\u2019t why. Maybe because I love the sight of wonderful\
  \ ancient civilitation; the shades of landscape, colours wich change  from yellow\
  \ and ochre. Or maybe because I lost my mobile phone in the toilet."
