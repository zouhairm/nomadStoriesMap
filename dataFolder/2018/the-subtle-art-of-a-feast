Text: "I met Jelena and Miodrag, when I was working on a cruise ship in 2016. I had\
  \ been working at the ship for some months and could gradually recognize every single\
  \ face of the one thousand crewmembers. I spotted them across the room in the crew\
  \ mess one late evening, after another long day of work. I had been working 14 hours\
  \ that day, was fed up with fake smiling and just wanted to stuff my face, before\
  \ I headed to my very own lonely island - my cabin. I stared at a glance, when i\
  \ noticed Jelena. Besides the fact that she looked like a mermaid with her long,\
  \ shiny, read hair - her beauty was mesmerizing. She had an olive-colored skin,\
  \ big green eyes and carried herself with such a grace and purity that i felt completely\
  \ dirty next to her. She was sitting together with a man, who probably was in his\
  \ late 20's, but had a big boyish smile across his face. What really caught my eye,\
  \ was the way they were enjoying their food. The food on a ship is never fresh and\
  \ in the crew mess it's almost always the same. Some broccoli and leak, that have\
  \ been frozen but now were boiled into pieces and some sort of grey, meat-a-like\
  \ substance on the side. I only ate it, so I would avoid waking up in the middle\
  \ of the night with a stomach that were screaming for food. I found absolutely no\
  \ pleasure in this food, it was pure fuel to my body. But this couple were having\
  \ a feast. They sat for hours every night in the crew mess. They were really tasting\
  \ the food, feeding each other with a smitten enthusiasm, when they found a new\
  \ undiscovered taste combination of the few commodities we had access to in the\
  \ mess. \n\nJelena and Miodrag was the first Serbians I've ever befriended. They\
  \ have taught me a lot of things in this short period of time where I've known them,\
  \ but the most important thing is the subtle art of having a feast. Whether it was\
  \ in there cabin, where we were sitting on the concrete floor and eating hotdogs\
  \ we found in the trash of something I don't think would be classified as meat.\
  \ Or when we were making banana-banana-and-nothing-but-banana-smoothies on the blender\
  \ Miodrag had smuggled aboard. Even at their wedding in Beograd, where Jelena wore\
  \ a dress that for a second made me doubt if she truly was a mermaid, put on this\
  \ land to enchant me, they never stopped celebrating. Celebrating the small things.\
  \ On the ship they were just thankful that they at least got a banana, otherwise\
  \ they would be making nothing-nothing-and-nothing-but-nothing-smoothies."
