Text: "The last thing I expected while discovering Hungarian salami, paprika, Egri\
  \ Bikaver \"bulls blood\" wine and running the marathon in Budapest was to meet\
  \ a group of unique people from around the world resulting in everlasting friendships\
  \ and an addiction for marathon travels.\n\nAs Steve sat drinking his beer on the\
  \ couch, I was hitting the \"continue now\" to purchase tickets to Asia.\n\n\"Honey,\
  \ we're going trekking in Nepal and then to the Taj Mahal before we arrive in Bangkok\
  \ to run the Bangkok marathon.\"\n\nA Himalayan trek is a metaphor for life itself...\"\
  \ said a famous mountaineer. And off we set with our blue backpacks, a roll of toilet\
  \ paper and a map of the Annapurna Circuit which would guide us on a trek full of\
  \ varied terrain, through villages, past goats and sherpas carrying baskets full\
  \ of raw meat or the entire contents of a hardware store on their backs.  All while\
  \ taking in the unforgettable views, which to this day, remains one of my favorite\
  \ photos, Steve and I gazing out over the Himalayas with the colorful prayer flags\
  \ dancing in the background.\n\nAs we trek higher in altitude, the price of a beer\
  \ becomes more expensive than our accommodation for the night. \n\nWe wake at 3\
  \ am, though we haven't slept much in anticipation of the trek over the pass. It's\
  \ like being on top of the world, Thorong La Pass (17,769 ft) treats us with spectacular\
  \ views over Mustang and the surrounding peaks while being surrounded in a sea of\
  \ clouds and prayer flags. \n\nOnward, a view, a discovery with every step. The\
  \ end of the circuit is near and we have to catch the last bus. We wait, worried\
  \ we have arrived too late but then a clunky old bus arrives. They toss our blue\
  \ backpacks on the roof of the bus and then, the last thing I expected was to be\
  \ climbing on the top of the bus with our bags, come chickens, a stove...We wind\
  \ our way towards our destination then whack, whack as one of the passengers on\
  \ the roof gets whacked in the head with tree branches....They laugh, \"this is\
  \ the real Nepal,\" ones says.\n\nFrom the serene mountains of Nepal, on to India\
  \ through the cows and carts, chaos, camels, horn honking, and an assault on the\
  \ senses, we arrive at the most perfect pearl on the banks of the Jumna at Agra\
  \ to gaze out over the Taj  Mahal.  \n\nNamaste\n\nAs the plane approached Bangkok,\
  \ from the air we could see the devastation, the city streets and outlaying fields\
  \ were under water. The Bangkok marathon wasn't going to happen...we will try again\
  \ this year."
