Text: "Our driver is flying down the road. The fact there are no traffic lanes\u2014\
  simply a matter of available space\u2014is something I\u2019ve not yet gotten used\
  \ to in Egypt. My heart races as we come so close to a motorcyclist I could reach\
  \ out and touch his jacket. The air freshener spins wildly out of control. Our driver\
  \ guns the engine, slamming on the brakes only when it\u2019s clear we\u2019ll bottom\
  \ out over a speed bump. He\u2019s installed an ambulance siren into his taxi, and\
  \ rather than slow down at the prospect of oncoming traffic, he speeds up and flips\
  \ the switch. The expression I see on others\u2019 faces as we zoom by matches our\
  \ own, portraits of shock that quickly disappear.\nMy travel friend Mark and I think\
  \ this could be the end. Our driver bargains with us, asking for more money\u2014\
  one hand on the wheel, the other in front of our faces. In his limited English he\
  \ doesn\u2019t understand, \u201CIf we die, we cannot pay you!\u201D \nTo think\
  \ only an hour ago I was crab walking down a vertical shoot into the heart of a\
  \ pyramid, thinking it was the best day of my life...\n---\n2 hrs earlier\nMark\
  \ and I see the Giza pyramids on camelback, and I\u2019m still reeling from standing\
  \ in front of the Sphinx, an icon I placed on a brochure of Egypt I made in the\
  \ 6th grade. I never imagined I would someday walk on the same ground as the pharaohs.\n\
  Our driver asks if we\u2019d also like to see hieroglyphs at Saqara and visit the\
  \ Red Pyramid\u2014into which we can climb\u2014and we agree. We settle on a price.\
  \ Everyone is happy.\n---\nThe driver, Mark, and I exchange shouts.\n\u201CTwo hundred\
  \ pounds more!\u201D he says, taking both hands off the wheel.\n\u201CThe road!\u201D\
  \ I scream. \u201CPlease, just let us off here!\u201D  \nWe are in the middle of\
  \ nowhere. The driver ignores my request.\nSomehow, after several Hail Mary\u2019\
  s (though neither Mark nor I are Catholic), we arrive in Cairo proper. Our driver\
  \ careens to a stop in bumper-to-bumper traffic, exits the car and flags down another\
  \ taxi. He speaks quickly to its driver and the other man nods. They exchange cash,\
  \ and we are ushered into this new car. Evidently our driver has a plane to catch,\
  \ and he\u2019s paid this man to bring us back to our hotel.\nMoments before he\
  \ races away, our first driver turns to us. With a final wave, he yells, \u201C\
  Thank you, thank you!\u201D He smiles, radiating with happiness.\nWe wave, dumbfounded,\
  \ and soon he is gone. \u201CI think we made a friend,\u201D Mark says.\nAlthough\
  \ I can\u2019t explain it, I have to agree. We smile to ourselves as the siren\u2019\
  s wail cuts through traffic and fades into the distance."
