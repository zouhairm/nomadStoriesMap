Text: "The thunderous roar of the crowd dies down and people begin to depart, the\
  \ blood of the bull soaking crimson into the blinding yellow sand of the arena.\
  \ I make my way out from under the shelter of the supports of the plaza de toros,\
  \ eager to miss the rush of the crowd. The streets branch off like a mythical labyrinth,\
  \ sure to lead me to my salvation or my doom. \nI take the path of least resistance\
  \ and make my way into the beating heart of this small Spanish town. The gates still\
  \ block off the streets where not long-ago locals and tourists stood in all their\
  \ excitement as the bulls ran through the main street, gone as quickly as they came.\
  \ There is barely a soul to be seen, the dry mud of a child\u2019s wellies on the\
  \ second-last rung the only sign that someone was there.   \n The effects of the\
  \ beer take hold as I stumble from one narrow street to the next. Young men with\
  \ Spanish flag capes run through the streets blowing air horns. People hang out\
  \ of tiny bars, plastic cups of questionable clear liquid in their hands. I take\
  \ a proffered cup and carry on. As I turn down another street, I think about the\
  \ time. The last thing I expected was to be lost in this small town with no charge\
  \ on my phone and nobody I knew in sight. \n The spirit burns my throat as it goes\
  \ down. The air is thick with heat, the drink and dehydration take hold, making\
  \ my head fuzzy. An abuela grabs me by the arm stopping me in my tracks. \u2018\xBF\
  Est\xE1s bien, ni\xF1a?\u2019 She hands me a plate covered in olives and slices\
  \ of chorizo. \u2018Si, si, gracias.\u2019 I run, shovelling the food into my mouth.\
  \ That\u2019s when I see it up ahead. My shiny chariot. The bus back to Salamanca,\
  \ my home for the Erasmus year. I pick up speed as the doors close after the last\
  \ student. \n\u201C\xA1Espera! \xA1Espera!\u201D I shout as it slowly pulls away,\
  \ running as fast as my feet will carry me. The few remaining olives give up their\
  \ balancing act and fall to the ground. As quickly as I spotted it, the bus is gone.\
  \ I find a bench and sink down, head in my hands, trying to think through the pounding.\
  \ My mind eventually settles and the world brightens, that heavy Spanish sun warming\
  \ my skin. I look around at the beauty of this little town, the beauty of the people\
  \ and their laughter. And realise I am happy to be here, right now in this moment.\
  \ \n \u2018There you are!\u2019 a familiar voice -my friend- shouts, coming over,\
  \ \u2018Where have you been?\u2019\n\u2018Oh, I\u2019ve just been around, you know.\u2019\
  \nShe takes my hand in hers. \u2018Let\u2019s find our way back.\u2019"
