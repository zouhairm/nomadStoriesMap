Text: "I knew of Bali when young, with the stories people told me, permeated into\
  \ the society I have spent most of my life living in.\nThe stories are constructed\
  \ through speaking differently\u2026\n\n\u2018It\u2019s so cheap and relaxing.\u2019\
  \n\n\u2018People are friendly and I love the vibe.\u2019\n\n\u2018The terror attacks\
  \ could have happened again at any moment, I was scared but the people are lovely.\u2019\
  \n\n\u2018I love Bali!\u2019\n\n\u2018I hate Bali.\u2019\n\nFinding truth through\
  \ these tales about a tropical island focused on tourism is difficult. It has a\
  \ place in Australian hearts and I tell my story from personal experiences.\n\n\
  My trip to the island was my first step into Indonesia. Ideas were paved but clarity\
  \ came from reality.\n\nThe moment I entered the immigration line I saw many Australians.\
  \ I walked slowly to the front and met an Indonesian Immigration Official. He started\
  \ something I began to learn about Indonesians. They seem amazingly beautiful and\
  \ testified to the reason behind why many people travel to Bali.\n\nFrom the local\
  \ food to the established foreign owned establishments. Each place showed why the\
  \ Island had become such a tourism delight, each person looking for their own individual\
  \ story to shape.\n\nCoffee was something that worked well in Bali. The cheap instant\
  \ coffee fix is done well or the luscious flavours of more expensive coffee brew\
  \ are available for enjoyment.\n\nFood is similar. Indonesian food was my preferred\
  \ delicacy and I must say that if you do not enjoy Indonesian food, then you should\
  \ plan your next trip to somewhere entirely different. I think tasting the local\
  \ food allows an appreciation of local culture. If you need Pizza then please choose\
  \ your next adventure to an Italian island, then I will know that you didn\u2019\
  t explore culture through Pizza Hut. But food is displayed in a variety of ways\
  \ to cater for all nonetheless.\n\nOne afternoon, I explored Uluwatu Temple on the\
  \ south-eastern coast and I loved how the aura of the place allures. The ocean is\
  \ stunning but captivates you more by the sheer cliffs built by the adjacent land\
  \ against it. Vision is key. Awe inspiration in those moments as you reflect on\
  \ life comes from such exhilarating sights. The blue, the green, the sky, the air\
  \ and the broad open ocean stretched to the horizon with waves crashing against\
  \ the land.\n\nI wandered and wondered around the majestic site.\n\nMy trip came\
  \ to an end and I could see why Bali is a true paradise, making me ponder about\
  \ the entire country.\n\nWhat to say about Bali?\n\n\u2018Bali is breathtakingly\
  \ stunning!\u2019"
