Text: "Thursday was the day the BRAIN program and I would begin our trip. BRAIN, a\
  \ program I joined in high school, stood for Bio-statistics and Research Awareness\
  \ Network. This was a team of African American students who wanted to learn and\
  \ push boundaries. We were encouraged to think in ways we hadn\u2019t before. We\
  \ were traveling to expand our knowledge, experience a new culture, and have the\
  \ honor to represent BRAIN at a Ferguson 1000 event. We got on the road and began\
  \ a journey to St. Louis. This was our destination, we were excited to indulge in\
  \ it. \nUpon arrival, we checked into a hotel and prepared for a fulfilling day\
  \ ahead. Jeff Hoffman, a great entrepreneur and friend, announced amazing news;\
  \ he arranged for us to meet Ray Lewis, a Baltimore Ravens football player. When\
  \ Ray arrived, he explained how he rose to the top. He told us he gained success\
  \ on the field through practice; he \u201Cstudied the game,\u201D the different\
  \ plays, his opponents weaknesses, and skill sets that brought him victory. This\
  \ taught me the significance of knowledge; the more you know, the more equipped\
  \ you are and the better you perform. \nAfterwards, we entered the Ferguson 1000\
  \ event. In attendance were inventors and entrepreneurs that aimed for success.\
  \ The ceremony showcased the history of hardship in Ferguson and how they planned\
  \ to improve these circumstances. It featured key speakers, Jeff Hoffman and Ray\
  \ Lewis. They explained the stepping stones essential in their life that helped\
  \ them reach their goals. The ceremony ended by bringing light back to Ferguson\
  \ 1000 and the community of St.Louis and how far the movement has come.  \nOverall,\
  \ the experience truly opened my eyes to the importance of travel. There\u2019s\
  \ lots you can learn, many ways to get involved and make a difference, even if it\
  \ just means speaking out about an issue. Movements start with individuals and success\
  \ comes from determination. I appreciate this experience and all it has taught me,\
  \ it sparked my interest for travel. I saw how much you can learn from one trip,\
  \ and knowledge you can gain. It was well worth it; I was able to experience the\
  \ movement that was happening in St. Louis. Also, I got to meet a passionate football\
  \ player, named Ray Lewis. He taught me the true power of knowledge and how it lead\
  \ him to greatness. Even though these two names were similar, they each had individual\
  \ significance in my life. They served as two different yet valuable lessons and\
  \ left an incredible, lasting impact on my life."
