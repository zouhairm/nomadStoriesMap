Text: "Ezra handed us a mussel each, fresh from his catch of the day. \"You'll never\
  \ taste any better.\"\nThe shells were black as onyx, smooth and glistening in the\
  \ light. \nBelize was renowned for its seafood, and these mussels did not disappoint.\
  \ Ezra smiled graciously as we complimented him on his catch. \"Perhaps I can take\
  \ you out tomorrow. I know the perfect spot with plenty to excite.\"\nLaura and\
  \ I were only in Caye Caulker for three nights, and tonight was going to be our\
  \ last.\n\"We'd love too,\" I said, \"but we leave for Playa del Carmen tomorrow.\"\
  \n\"Then I shall take you out now. No time too waste.\"\nEzra's boat was small and\
  \ modest, cruising above crystal-like Caribbean water. Beneath this surface teemed\
  \ one of the most breathtaking reef systems this planet has to offer. It was simply\
  \ another day in paradise. I was awestruck by the rawness of it.\nLaura grasped\
  \ my hand as the vessel bounced over whitecaps. For her, paradise was back on the\
  \ caye amongst the colourful streets, where solid land was beneath her feet and\
  \ palm fronds rustled in a tropical breeze - ideal conditions for sipping cocktails\
  \ whilst you tanned.\nOur favourite spot was The Lazy Lizard, a lively bar by a\
  \ channel known as The Split, where the caye was divided. Stories told that The\
  \ Split was created by a hurricane, whilst others detailed locals dredging it by\
  \ hand.\nI wasn't sure which was true.\nPerhaps Ezra would know.\n\"How long have\
  \ you lived here for?\" I asked.\n\"My whole life,\" Ezra replied. \"I've never\
  \ left the Caribbean.\"\n\"Why would you ever want to leave?\" Asked Laura.\nEzra\
  \ shrugged. \"The world is big and beautiful.\"\n\"So your family are from Belize?\"\
  \n\"S\xEC, originally from the Yucatan Peninsula. We're what you call Mestizos,\
  \ many of which fled to places like Caye Caulker during the caste war.\"\nI suppose\
  \ the caye had always been a place to escape to.\nWhat lay beneath however was otherworldly.\
  \ There was no caste war beneath the surface - species of all kinds swam together.\n\
  Behind us Ezra pointed to something, and we turned in the water to see a nurse shark\
  \ approaching. Two-and-a-half metres of curious fish examined us as it swam by,\
  \ and to my surprise Laura reached out a hand.\nThe beast consented, allowing Laura\
  \ to brush it from jaws to tail, before continuing on its way.\nLaura returned to\
  \ the surface, and I followed.\n\"I can't believe I just did that.\" She was beaming\
  \ with excitement.\nThe shark had welcomed us into its world, just as Ezra had,\
  \ who resurfaced with a mussel in each hand."
