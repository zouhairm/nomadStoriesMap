Text: "Amidst a myriad of contenders, one time, place and event rises above the rest:\
  \ Gay Pride in Rio de Janeiro. I had wondered down to Copacabana beach for a morning\
  \ smoothie when my attention was arrested by a raucous parade rumbling towards me.\
  \ At first, I assumed I'd stumbled into their famous carnival. But no, the month\
  \ was November, not February and the floats were soundtracked by glittery house\
  \ music instead of samba beats. A man in a sparkly hat beckoned me onto a moving\
  \ stage. \n I had arrived from Dubai, a modern metropolis built on the foundations\
  \ of a deeply conservative society. Just as every country is different, so is every\
  \ person and the shimmering sands of Rio\u2019s beaches were open to one and all.\
  \ I was welcomed into the party as everyone is; this is the beauty of Gay Pride.\
  \ Everyone's invited, no matter how weird you are, the weirder the better actually.\
  \ There\u2019s just one rule: be nice and you\u2019re allowed to enter this temporary\
  \ palace of freedom. \n Rainbow flags fluttered, reminding me why I travel. I had\
  \ just nipped out for a morning smoothie and I already knew I wouldn\u2019t be returning\
  \ home till long after the sun had set. Our stage was still slowly rolling along\
  \ the beach road, a cog in a convoy of pleasure vehicles. People who would never\
  \ normally have crossed paths were talking, sharing ideas, joking and dancing. The\
  \ panorama around me was a picture of evolutionary hedonism. \n Life is sometimes\
  \ distilled into moments, and we define these moments in thoughts. I remember dancing\
  \ on the sands of Ipanema beach alongside a full spectrum of gender and children\
  \ and pensioners of every creed and colour. I recall looking around, seeing the\
  \ pure joy and escapism scribbled all over the faces of everyone in attendance.\
  \ The man in the sparkly hat was beaming. And I will never forget thinking that\
  \ although it was the last thing I expected, the world needs more days like these."
