Text: "It was 5am when the men I was driving with stopped the car and went out to\
  \ pray. My friend Asad and I, were travelling from Bogor to Bandung, leaving at\
  \ 3am to make to our early morning meeting with the Wildan family.\nMr. Wildan had\
  \ worked in agriculture for his entire life. Presently he has about 100 acres, where\
  \ he grows veggies, tea, and coffee. He and his wife served us an open air welcoming\
  \ breakfast.\nLater we jumped into a jeep and drove further up the mountain, where\
  \ the coffee plantation was. My boots were all muddy and I could barely see bushes\
  \ through the mist. It was the last week of February, the coffee berries were red\
  \ and ready to be collected. \n\u201CBandung was one of the first regions in the\
  \ country to have railroads, and to develop\u201D tells Mr. Wildan. \u201CIt was\
  \ also the pioneering one in the Indonesian coffee industry. Plantations were successful\
  \ for decades, but, then suddenly all\u2026 gone. The \u2018coffee rust\u2019 was\
  \ brought to the region and flourished in our mist. Coffee growing vanished from\
  \ here for a century.\u201D \nI ate a couple of berries. They were sweet with a\
  \ bit of tart aftertaste. I couldn\u2019t imagine this place NOT being a coffee\
  \ plantation. \n\u201CIn the early 2000s, me and my colleagues decided to bring\
  \ coffee back to our land.\u201D Mr. Wildan continued. \u201CThe easiest way to\
  \ avoid rust would be using pesticides, but that wasn\u2019t our path. So we introduced\
  \ some creativity. Firstly, we used the fact, that only arabica gets damaged by\
  \ the rust, robusta doesn\u2019t.  So we always maintain careful rotation of species/.\
  \ Secondly, we came up with a number of organic fertilizer mixes. Although they\
  \ do not take the mycelium away completely, they still let us grow and collect a\
  \ lot of berries. This way we managed to bring the industry back and to sustain\
  \ it for more than 15 years now.\u201D He said proudly. \nFinally, we entered the\
  \ tiny farm house for lunch. Mrs Wildan showed me her accounting books that she\
  \ still does manually. After food came the best part, tasting of their coffee.\n\
  The family has a roaster for home usage. They brought up beans and we roasted, ground,\
  \ mixed and drank them together. Coffee this fresh tasted amazing.\nThere is no\
  \ better way to dig into a region\u2019s culture, than watching people doing work\
  \ on its land. I had a great day with this devoted family. The rust and mist situation\
  \ taught me that nature can be a blessing and a curse, but with dedication and creativity,\
  \ we can generate new ideas and solutions and thrive against the odds."
