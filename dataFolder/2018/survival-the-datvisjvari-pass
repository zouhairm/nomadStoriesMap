Text: "I never thought trying to get over a romantic breakup would lead me in the\
  \ span of a month to a near death experience, twice! It was November 2012, the month\
  \ of my 30th birthday. I had decided that the best gift I can offer myself was to\
  \ move on from my grief. What is better than occupying myself with survival in a\
  \ hostile environment? Destination Georgia, a place I know nothing about, not even\
  \ the alphabet.\nI remember crumbling to my knees somewhere around Datvisjvari Pass\
  \ at 2689m altitude wondering how I ended up waiting in two feet high snow for a\
  \ miracle to be saved.\nThe turning point was the night before when Gigo, my host\
  \ Nazi\u2019s husband, convinced me about visiting Shatilli a village inhabited\
  \ by one family the Arabshvili (sons of the arabs), sitting in his Toyota 4WD parked\
  \ in Kazbegi city square full of aimlessly wandering stray dogs, waiting for the\
  \ marshrutka to drop his son off from Tbilisi. It took us, nevertheless, 2 hours\
  \ to realize that Tbilisi marshrutka was scheduled for the next day. In our defense,\
  \ we were totally pissed on Gigo\u2019s low quality homemade vodka; earlier that\
  \ evening, he insisted to start drinking, while eating my kharcho soup, a toast\
  \ to grief and reason \u2013 his exact words-. I had already, under the insistence\
  \ of his questions, revealed the reason behind my trip, all with my broken Deutsch.\
  \ Realizing how bad my state was, he tried first to comfort me, talk some sense\
  \ to me. He quickly understood that would be to no avail. He disappeared for a while\
  \ only to return with a dark blue glass bottle; I never understood what was so special\
  \ about this new vodka, it was as bad as the first one. Gogi scrambled me out on\
  \ the terrace, poured two shots, handed me one, spoke yet another unintelligible\
  \ toast, dropped part of his drink on the floor and swallowed what remained. I imitated\
  \ him.\nHe told me about his relationship with Nazi, how his feelings made him follow\
  \ her across the russian borders altering completely his life course, how he felt\
  \ compelled to cheat on her to remember how deep his love is, how he clang every\
  \ day to life for her. He wrapped it saying: \u201Ccry, my son cry! We are lucky\
  \ we can love this way\u201D.\nThe next morning, he drove me as far as the pass.\
  \ We had an argument after I asked him to drop me and go, and he called me a suicidal\
  \ fool and left. Next time I saw him was 3 days later on my way back from Shatili.\
  \ He ran at me hugged me, put his hand behind my neck, looked me in the eyes and\
  \ said: \u201CFeeling better?\u201D I nodded."
