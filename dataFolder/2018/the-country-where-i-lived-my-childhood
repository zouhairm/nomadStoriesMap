Text: "I always remember my childhood with a smile and awe in my heart.The first thing\
  \ that needs to be said I was born in the wonderful country of Uzbekistan. In a\
  \ small town called Chirchik. \nMy warm and friendly town differed from relations\
  \ with neighbors. On our street there are different nationalities of people who\
  \ helped each other with various problems. We often planted trees in our area, every\
  \ Saturday was cleaning yards of debris, watered the flowers, while old men sat\
  \ on a bench and talked drinking hot green tea to reduce pressure and hot weather.\
  \ In a small yard small children played different games such as hide and seek, bouncers,\
  \ hopscotch and skipping.I admired our area seeing mutual understanding with each\
  \ other, support for those in need. The friendship of Nations makes us one family.\
  \ \nAn unique culture different from other countries amazing holiday of Navruz.The\
  \ main sacrament occurs on the night of March 21. It is time to prepare the main\
  \ ritual dish of sumalyak - a dish cooked on a wood fire from flour and sprouted\
  \ wheat grains, sometimes with spices. The huge boiler was about the whole mahalla,\
  \ mostly women, sit in a circle, singing songs, having fun, each waiting for their\
  \ turn to stir the sumalak. In the morning sumalak is still warm to give to neighbors,\
  \ relatives, and friends. Trying sumalak need to make a wish-the locals said-will\
  \ come true.\nThere is no fast traffic, crazy traffic jams and constant traffic\
  \ jams. We have a help Desk, which may apply to any person asking for assistance.\
  \ If you have lost or forgotten something, you can apply to the Bureau. Your ad\
  \ will broadcast audio ads and the probability that the thing will be found is very\
  \ large. In our city a lot of parks and greenery. Therefore, going outside, residents\
  \ of the city have a great opportunity to enjoy clean and fresh air. All parks and\
  \ recreation areas were created by our citizens on the initiative of the green Committee.\
  \ A special society was set up to gather volunteers for free work.Now they are a\
  \ great place for a family holiday. \nWe are very happy that such a comfortable\
  \ stay was able to create with their own hands. Now, no one's throwing papers and\
  \ bottles at the streets. We have learned to appreciate our and others ' work.\n\
  In conclusion, I can say that we travel around the world, travel, meet new people,\
  \ but in the heart there is always only one corner of warmth and comfort, where\
  \ you feel not just at home, but really there, in your native land."
