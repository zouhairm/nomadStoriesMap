Text: "We only had two days to complete the mission, drive 860 miles from St. Louis\
  \ to Fairfax, Virginia with a race against time, to save my 1997 Chevy Cavalier\
  \ from the impound.  The first week in October 2010, I was down in the basement\
  \ at a friends house,  when he came home and asked me where my car was. Confused,\
  \ I frantically ran upstairs and out the front door, only to be shocked staring\
  \ at an empty parking spot on the curb where my car has always been. I thought he\
  \ was playing a trick on me, and moved my car down the street, in order to teach\
  \ me a lesson about leaving my keys in the ignition; yet his face was just as stunned\
  \ as mine. The only thing I could do was laugh hysterically at the situation, perhaps\
  \ I was in shock and that was the only reaction that came out. It took about 15\
  \ minutes for me to calm down enough in order to call the police, the insurance\
  \ company, and my dad; he was not happy. After three weeks and no phone calls, I\
  \ accepted the fact that my car was gone, and since my insurance company wouldn't\
  \ pay for it, I had to look for another car. A few days later I found one online\
  \ and was going to pick it up within a few days, but as soon as I hung up the phone,\
  \ a call came in from Fairfax, Virginia. It was Sheriff Johnson, he explained that\
  \ cameras on police cars are constantly scanning license plates for stolen vehicles,\
  \ and mine showed up on their computer. He said a couple of teenagers were in love\
  \ and wanted to run away together, they are now in custody, and my car will be impounded.\
  \ It was Thursday night, and I had until 6 a.m. on Sunday before they close, plus\
  \ daily charges of $100 so we had to act fast. \nThe next morning, I borrowed my\
  \ mom's Durango, turned on \"Born to be Wild\",  and jumped on I-70 Eastbound. About\
  \ 40 miles into Illinois, a loud metal on metal grinding sound was coming from the\
  \ front end. Suddenly, the whole truck began to shake violently, so we pulled over\
  \ and called a tow truck; it cost $500 to fix the wheel bearing, otherwise the wheel\
  \ would've fell off.  4 hours later, we drove back home and started fresh Saturday\
  \ morning at 8 a.m. in order to make it to the impound before they close.  \n860\
  \ miles and what should've been 14 hours, took 19 to get there due to construction\
  \ nearly the whole way, so instead of driving 70 we were only allowed 45 most of\
  \ the way. I called ahead to explain our situation and asked the lady if they could\
  \ stay open until we got there, with a 3 hour nap in Maryland, we made it an hour\
  \ late."
