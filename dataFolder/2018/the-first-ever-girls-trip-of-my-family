Text: "As I do believe in destiny , here is something that in my wildest dream I had\
  \ never imagined would've happened . Being Indian and belonging to a conservative\
  \ family outing was never an option for me . But deep down I knew I was a slave\
  \ of nature  the only thing which gave me happiness and an insight to find myself\
  \ .\n           Well last year was completely a Turner for me as it turned out I\
  \ was doing things which I had expected least . So here comes it as a big surprise\
  \ for me was my father saying to me that you are going to Shimla-Manali with your\
  \ cousins . The thought of going out and that too just girls left me quiet speechless.\n\
  \           Our journey began on 8th June 2017 , we boarded our flight to Delhi\
  \ and were suppose to travel from Delhi to Shimla and then Manali . We had assigned\
  \ a travel company for touring around.\nWe boarded the bus and reached Shimla by\
  \ night as it was a long and tiring journey and also the roads which passed through\
  \ mountains and valleys giving us all an adrenaline rush looking down from the window\
  \ as bus was travelling scared us , I was sitting near a window the steep and deep\
  \ valleys were mesmerizing i just wondered how people were residing on these mountains,\
  \ the great scenic views were just marvellous and so were the hotels where we were\
  \ residing.\n         Being in Shimla for us girls gave that amazing feeling and\
  \ it was still unbelievable that we were all by ourselves. Our next destination\
  \ Manali will always be my favourite , we reached Manali by midnight of 11th June.\
  \  The very next moment our tour guide bombarded with us with the news that we had\
  \ to wake up at 3am the same day as we had to travel for our sightseeing , which\
  \ was Rohtang pass , tired and confused with schedule we decided not to go but eventually\
  \ we wokeup as it was a once in a lifetime opportunity and I couldn't miss going\
  \ to Rohtang pass . Overjoyed to see snow-clad mountains we reached there by 6am\
  \ in the morning as the sun was rising slowly , it just became mesmerizing to look\
  \ at these mountains in the rising Sun, another beautiful and unexpected thing happened\
  \ was the snowfall in the middle of June when most of the snow was melted , it started\
  \ snowing , everything just felt like it was meant to be . \n          We visited\
  \ the local destinations after the Rohtang pass and shopped at the local market\
  \ over there . As our journey was about to end I just felt like I don't want to\
  \ go back . We boarded the bus for Delhi again ."
