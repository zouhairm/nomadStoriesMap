Text: "Mimicking a punctured garden hose, my left foot cried out in pain as I held\
  \ on to my overly bronzed human crutch, a homeless man (I later find out) --though\
  \ his fierce, musty odor never suggested otherwise.\n\nI stood there, vulnerable.\
  \ Wet. Dazed. Days into my solo adventure and a ravine --like gash was putting to\
  \ canvas what my heart was feeling.\n\nIt was Friday the 13th, in Puerto Viejo de\
  \ Salamanca, Costa Rica, and due to a buzzing jetlag I had arrived half an hour\
  \ too early for breakfast at the Puerto Pirata Deli and now found myself scanning\
  \ the area for help. \n\n\u201CIt\u2019s fine\u2026really, thank you.\u201D I had\
  \ muttered unconvincingly. As you do when a homeless man zealously volunteers to\
  \ run down to the pharmacy for you, expecting nothing in return- except for cash\
  \ in advance to pay for the first aid products he was going to fetch. \n\nWas I\
  \ cynical? Absolutely. \n\nSomething about his eyes hinted of a mellifluous sadness\
  \ and yet his charismatic Duchenne smile erased it all together. His aged beard,\
  \ the color of secondhand smoke, faultlessly complemented his tousled hair cascading\
  \ in waves from under his cap. \n\n\u201CHow about we walk together?\u201D I offered.\
  \ \n\nWe confided our deepest secrets. He mentioned an excessive drug abuse, and\
  \ his reason for choosing to be homeless. \n\n\u201CNo job means no money for drugs\u201D\
  \ he proudly whispered. \nI congratulated him, for he was celebrating 25 years of\
  \ being drug free. A respectable feat. \n\nI confessed the reason for my trip \u2013\
  a loved one\u2019s suicide. \n\n\u201CLive. And be happy\u201D he breathed. \u201C\
  We only have one life, make the best of it.\u201D\n\nI watched like a child in awe\
  \ as he gallantly patched up my foot, his face illumined all the while. \n\n\u201C\
  Look at me, I\u2019m a doctor!\u201D He sang. \n\nHe admired his artwork and for\
  \ a real second considered what his life would have been like had he really been\
  \ a doctor. \n\nBefore parting ways, we enjoyed a few extra minutes of each other\u2019\
  s company at the local caf\xE9. I ordered a coffee, and he sipped a Coca Cola while\
  \ he read the newspaper, all the while making comments about the economic situation\
  \ in various countries. \n\nExhausted from the hectic morning, my honorary doctor\
  \ laid down for a nap, of course not before changing my bandage for a second time.\n\
  And as he slept, I gazed at the translucent cerulean blue between surging palm trees\
  \ and I could not help but smile. My foot was bandaged and my heart was significantly\
  \ lighter.\n\nI whispered farewell lingering around just long enough to feel the\
  \ dawning of an iridescent hope."
