Text: "I\u2019ve always been attracted by the power of this island, and now I can\
  \ understand why. I\u2019m here, standing in front of the desolation; I stand in\
  \ front of a land that keeps all her secrets under the ice, I stand between the\
  \ mountain and the see, the ice and the boiling underground. Here, in the middle\
  \ of nowhere, I finally found my destination, feeling the ground under my feet I\
  \ understand what is Iceland. The colourfull and astonishing Reykjavik, the beauty\
  \ behind every corner of Akureyri, the amazing people that I\u2019ve found here,\
  \ nothing compares to this. The secret and uncontaminated, priceless beauty of the\
  \ wild Iceland. This feeling comes to me ad strong as the freezing wind strikes\
  \ my face, as clear as the sky, embellished by the aurora. I came here for a travel,\
  \ I actually found inspiration."
