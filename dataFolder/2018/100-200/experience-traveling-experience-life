Text: "Kenya as part of Africa has been greatly in valued based on their economic\
  \ possibilities and their closeness to countries like Somalia. During my time there\
  \ I discovered that this country has so much to offer in form of food, entertainment\
  \ but mostly the people which is super friendly easily relatable too. My stay there\
  \ was amazing didn\u2019t excepted this country to give me this much in form of\
  \ experience and getting to know local cultural trends such as the high job of the\
  \ Masai tribe (a tribe living very primitative with the animal of the savanna. I\
  \ myself participated in this high job, this is how they attracted female, but unfortunalty\
  \ was not agile enough to impress either the men or women of the tribe, but this\
  \ will always remain a great memory throught my whole life."
