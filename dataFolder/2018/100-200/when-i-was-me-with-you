Text: A girl with Guatemalan roots who is sent to America illegally with her uncle
  & his wife to live the "American dream". As she grows up in her small town, abiding
  social norms & fitting in with cool crowd, she is asked to do a family research
  project over the holiday break, which takes her to multiple dead ends. Her uncle
  and his gringo wife never speak of her family or their mother country. Why? What
  are they afraid of? More importantly what are they protecting? After her uncle gets
  sick, he leaves her with letters from her late mother, money & a passport. As the
  girl prepares for her trip home over spring break & she realizes that the letters
  she was given hold all the answers, clues & secrets to her native rich, indegenuous
  family history. More importantly who she truly was or still is. Mixing modern day
  norms,history, technology & pop culture, a girl of a hidden village finds out that
  she's not only just another immigrant living the American dream... she is royalty
  of a tribe that is close to extinction.
