Text: 'I was just over two months backpacking around Canada, that day was meant to
  be my relaxing day a good book which I had found in the hostel, a hammock and enjoy.


  But another solitary soul appeared in that place, he had a big car, one of those
  American movie cars. He asked me if I wanted to join to see a lost lake that someone
  had recommended to him.


  We crossed with that car up through the middle of rivers (we continue with topics
  from American movies). After walking about 3km, losing the path a million times
  and invented a new one, we arrived at a beautiful place.


  On the way we saw lots of snow, something unthinkable for me in August, beavers,
  we believe that a bear in the distance and only 3 people.


  The most beautiful thing was to listen to the beauty of nothing'
