Text: "Foreign exchange girl from Berlin gets sent to Oklahoma for her junior year\
  \ in high school. She becomes very popular and even years later she is still very\
  \ well connected with her friends from high school. 8 years later her best friend\
  \ gets married and she is invited to her wedding. What a perfect opportunity to\
  \ explore more of the states and visit all her friends who live now all over the\
  \ country: Washington DC/ NYC / Kansa City and last but not least back to Oklahoma.\
  \ She was very tempted to see all her high school friends again - what she didn\u2019\
  t expect to see was her best friends little brother who obviously was not a \u201E\
  little brother\u201C anymore."
