Text: Cayman Islands. ... trips and travels that bonds you closer to your planet earth.  The
  Cayman Islands is a place that I traveled which pushed me closer to the earth.  Coming
  from totally opposite side of the world. This place got me closer to the boundaries
  the horizons and the divine beauties that existed    The cultural diversity the
  people was turned me and pushed to the edge.  I was bestowed with rich scenic beauty
  as well as the culture.  The clear waters, the stingray city. The rum point. The
  conch. Fritters. The sunset house. The west bay beach.  The seven mile beach. The
  pirates week was my lifetime memory..
