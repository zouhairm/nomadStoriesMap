Text: The beautiful of any place on earth begins from the moment we look at it like
  a traveller. I was at Narmada river Madhya Pradesh, India taking a ride in a simple
  boat. The ride on the boat was the first of its kind in my life. I was mesmerized
  by the visual feast of green water and the white rock marbles alongside the waterfront.
  The sound of the water when the boat paddles touched them was the rythem to my ears.
  The white marbles looked more elegant naked untouched by any human chisel. That
  was the day when I realized beauty of marbles is more than we could appreciate as
  a showpiece in our living rooms.
