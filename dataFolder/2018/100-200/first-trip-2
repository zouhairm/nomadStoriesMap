Text: "My name is Kaliev Ulan and I'm 16. I am from the most hospitable country -\
  \ Kazakhstan. And now i will tell you my story.\n My first trip to another country\
  \ was in October 2017 year . How we know nowadays many olympiads from the best universities\
  \ of Europe countries. Me and my friend planned this very late but we managed. Our\
  \ school's team was two 10th grade, two girls from 5th grade and our teacher.\n\
  \  And the funny thing is that I was afraid of flying.then I was embarrassed to\
  \ fly because 5 graders were not afraid. To my happiness everything was good.\n\
  \ In Turkey i meet friends that changed my life and most of them was from opposite\
  \ gender. And i have new opportunities that will help me in future.\n I concluded\
  \ that traveling changes people to good side. In future i will travel with my family\
  \ more than now."
