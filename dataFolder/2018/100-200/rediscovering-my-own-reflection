Text: 'Well I believe caught in the midst of worldly affairs ,many a times we loose
  sight of our capabilities and talents ..Only through courage and determination we
  can realise our own abilities and values and rediscover our own brilliance ...My
  decision to achieve my goals and be of use to other people truly pushed me to realise
  that even if I met so many obstacles ,but I didn''t fear or worry about moving forward
  ..I always had a resolute grip on my goals ....I went to so many villages to help
  women educate and learn the importance of women empowerment...I faced lots of problems
  in my journey but I never gave up ...I travelled to so many small villages , understood
  the problems of women living their which also made me realise that life is too short
  to have grudges.

  My travel story becamd my life story ...A story that taught me that there are a
  lot of intelligent people on this world but not many who can adhere to their goals
  ..Those who succeed in life may not be the fastest or smartest ,but they are the
  most determined.'
