  I want to share my experience traveling with people so that everyone can benefit
  from it

  On a trip to Turkey for tourism I decided to book a hotel I had booked a hotel online
  and paid by Visa Cart

  But when I arrived, the booking did not exist and I had to book again online and
  from the hotel itself because the prices they told me were different from the prices
  on the internet

  note:

  And do not forget to always attend with you a camera is one of the most important
  conditions of travel to document the beautiful items

  If you come with a close friend, it is better to travel on your own because traveling
  alone is very boring, no matter how wonderful the place is

  And do not forget to always bring happiness with you because it does not exist where
  you want.'
