Text: 'Essay on lightness it''s about how people turn their daily shores into their
  lives.

  Describing the environment that surrounds them that often induces them to believe
  they actually have a choice in a world full of routines, deadlines, goals to pursue
  and people to catch on, may be the only way to make them realize that such an existance
  is nothing more than a light (but hard) way to go on.

  Sometimes company is not the same as being surronded by a huge crowd; dare I say
  it tends to lonelines much more.

  There''s many things I wish to talk about on this essay, but the focus is, as painful
  as it may be, reality and facing your own self, your expectations and embracing
  the soul within in order to truly understand what you want.'
