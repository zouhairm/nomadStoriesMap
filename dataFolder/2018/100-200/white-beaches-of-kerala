Text: Are you the one who loves to enjoy the serene beaches with little hustle & bustle
  of the crowd?? Then welcome to this little secret of Kerala- white sand beach of
  "Marari".We had never plan this beach visit during our tour. But unavailability
  of houseboat during the peak time of the year & some genuine advice of our hotel
  manager landed up in this beautiful beach located within a few kms from Alleppey
  & trust me we will never regret it.The crowd here is very limited. You can rent
  chairs & enjoy the tranquility of the beach along with your partner & get yourself
  soaked up in somy cozy romance. If you are lucky enough you can also figure out
  some dolphins during the afternoon. There are many small shops along the beach for
  light tit-bits as well as a proper local meal. The sunset is an absolute delight
  to watch. It is well connected via Alleppey or Kumarakom. Commercialisation haven't
  reached here yet. There are few hotels also located near the beach.. If you want
  a symphony of peace, beauty & tranquility Marari beach should definitely be there
  in your bucket list...
