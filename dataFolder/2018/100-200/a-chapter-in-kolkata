Text: It was 21st june 2016 when my sister was felicitated for her results and i left
  the town with any prior notice to anyone. I didn't had a cellphone no money just
  a 10 rupee nte in my ticket . I boarded the general ward of kanchunjunga from ghy
  railway station to kolkata. Without ticket. Though i was scared but i was somewhere
  confident enough to start a new life on my own. I was sitting beside the train gate
  it was overcrowded because it was  indian general bogie, a guy named mahadev came
  next to me, he was staring at my guitar and with a glimpse he asked me, tu kya ghar
  se bhaaga hai? I was shocked and i replied yes. He asked me if i ate something or
  not i lied to him but he configured that and gave me two chapattis from his tiffin
  box amd asked me to eat with the bhajji. At first i denied then he insisted and
  the food was though.
