Text: 'Last December I left for Mexico. It was my first travel on my own and I was
  excited as well as scared sometimes. I had a just one-way ticket and except the
  first 2 nights, I had no plans. I wanted to decide on the spot base on feelings
  and base on the people that I would find on my way.

  I ended up with spending 32 days in Mexico and able to experiences the real taste
  of Mexico. Just to give you an idea, on the 1st of January I got invited to a local
  Ceremony. I didn''t take much info, I accepted and it turned out to be a very ancient
  ceremony: Temazcal. I was the only Western person and I felt special because they
  wanted to get me involved in an important moment for them. I really appreciated.'
