Text: "I was in lybia I've watched a terrible. For the first time in my life  \u060C\
  It was really horrible,  I started my journey from Sudan through Chad to Libya\u060C\
  \ I paid about $ 7,000 to save myself, but in the end I was sold to the human trafficking\
  \ mafia. I put a prisoner in until the right customer came, but I found the opportunity\
  \ to escape! That was the happiest day of my life \u060Cpassed through the cities\
  \ controlled by the Islamic state organization ,I saw Mafia smuggling and human\
  \ trafficking, I was one of the victims but I fled, I wished I could use the camera\
  \ but I managed to survive in my soul\u060C I lost my passport and all my money,\
  \ but I did not give up! I went to one of the cities near the beach, worked in the\
  \ paint houses and collected some money, took the boat through the Mediterranean\
  \ to Italy! I'm very happy and lucky, I ended up here in France and started my new\
  \ life, but I will never stop traveling, I love to travel to new places, and to\
  \ see new people every day."
