Text: "I love traveling, i never settle, and being a photographer is had added a little\
  \ uniqueness to my traveling style. Capturing everywhere i go in my camera and sharing\
  \ it with whole world to get visually inspired. With my travel photographs i try\
  \ to tell my own story and inspire people to get outside and explore how much our\
  \ earth has to offer. \n\nTravel is my life, i travel to escape the solitary life\
  \ and loneliness. I have my gear to help me out while on adventure to discover the\
  \ undiscovered destination. \n\nTravel makes us confident so does it have on me.\
  \ It brought me a new way to live my boring life. If i ever got a chance to explore\
  \ the world i will not hesitate, i would rather pack my bag.\n\nTravel is my passion,\
  \ therefore i want to inspire more."
