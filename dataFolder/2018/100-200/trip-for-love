Text: "Like all the years, between the summer i went for a vacation.\nIt was the year\
  \ 2017,in middle of the summer on 15th June.\nVaranasi, the heaven! \nWhen i reached\
  \ up there and while travelling on the ghats of Ganga with a cup of tea in my hand\
  \ i found something that touches my shoulder.\nAs travelling alone and getting a\
  \ sudden reaction from a unknown person is a matter of shock. I hooked up.\nThen\
  \ i look backward and then i saw a girl looking down to the earth, in pain and picking\
  \ something off from the foot.\nShe was uncomfortable in that situation so i decided\
  \ to get her rid of the situation.\nBlood was coming out from her feet.\nIt was\
  \ a iron nail there.\nAnd holding her feet, i thought this world should be like\
  \ her feet.\nWarm and Beautiful !!!\n\nAnd i fell in love with her and i really\
  \ fell hard !"
