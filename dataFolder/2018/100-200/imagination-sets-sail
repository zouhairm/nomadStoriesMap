Text: ALL THROUGH THE WAY PEOLPE SLIGHTLY THINKS LONELY TRAVELLING IS TOO BORE....BUT
  MY DOUBT WAS GOTTEN CLEAR WHEN MY JOURNEY STARTED FROM MUMBAI,INDIA. IT WAS NOT
  A TRIP...BUT JUST TOO UNDERSTAND PEOLE WHEN I WAS ALONE ....I USE TO SMELL THE AROMA
  IN THE AIR IT WAS GIVING ME A UNIQUE ENVIRONMENT WHICH WAS IN MUMBAI ..THE BUSY,CROWDS...I
  NEVER FELT ALONE IN BETWEEN THEM.THE SPICENESS WAS NOT IN BUFFET BUT ALSO IN THE
  NATURE.....COLOURFUL DRESSES AND FACES...MAKING A JOYFUL VIBES.MORNING DOESN'T STARTS
  WITH ALARM BUT WITH THE COCK DOODLE...TAKING A SIP OF GINGER TEA ..N HAVING A RUSK
  TOAST WITH IT MAKES THE DAY .....THEN GETS READY TO SEE MY MINI WORLD...BEING COLOURFUL
  LIKE MUMBAIKAR....MAKES A DIFFERRNT MADNESS..HAVING FUN UNLIMITED AS MY STEPS RETURN
  TO MY HOMES MY MEMORIES WERE GETTING INTO MY EYES N MAKE ME SMILE ......I LOVE TRAVELLING
  WHETHER GROUP OR ME ALONE ...MY DOORS NEVER STOP TOWARDS THE WORLD TOUR I LIKE TO
  BE PRESENT IN THE ALL CORNER OF  THIS BEAUTIFUL WORLD ....WISH THE DREAMS COME TRUE
