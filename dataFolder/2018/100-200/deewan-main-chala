Text: At one fine day I decided to go for a tour to Manali with my friends, so we
  started our tour with bag in our hands n ticket of a train, we started the tour
  with only 3 friends but after some hours we came with some people who were also
  on the way to Manali with there family members,  we interacted with them me hardly
  felt that they were onkown to us, the weather was getting colder n colder with night,
  the train travel i always enjoy since my childhood memories so we where near to
  Manali and wat he can see is the snow allover the place, it was an heaven on earth
  the view was so pleasant that it can't be vanished even if I'll be very old this
  is the life time memory,  I want to explore new places on the earth until I am alive
