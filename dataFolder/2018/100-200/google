Text: "At present the gravest problem that Pakistan is facing is terrorism. It has\
  \ become a headache for federation and a nightmare for public. Though, it is a global\
  \ issue but Pakistan has to bear the brunt of it. Pakistan\u2019s involvement in\
  \ the War on Terror has further fuelled the fire. We are facing war like situation\
  \ against the terrorists. This daunting situation is caused due to several factors.\
  \ These factors include social injustice, economic disparity, political instability,\
  \ religious intolerance and also external hands or international conspiracies. A\
  \ handful of people who have their vicious interests to fulfil have not only taken\
  \ countless innocent lives but also distorted the real image of Islam before the\
  \ world through their heinous acts. Terrorist acts like suicide bombings have become\
  \ a norm of the day. On account of these attacks Pakistan is suffering from ineffaceable\
  \ loss ranging from civilian to economic. People have become numerical figures,\
  \ blown up in numbers every now and then. Terrorists have not spared any place."
