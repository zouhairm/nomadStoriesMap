Text: A passionate woman for what I do, working as an actor in a theater; until one
  day an evil one pushed me be out of the tabloids. My deception took me to a pleaceful
  place inside the Desert where I asked God to lift it me up with a vision on my own
  and; Never to work depending under others rules again. After a deep breath I opened
  my eyes, I saw of the melting different color that a desert can offer and a camel.
  From that point I knew exactly what I needed  to do to create something on my own
  right that will impact my future and others life
