Text: I am writing a story of a man that has been heartbroken time after time by women
  he has fallen for. He has figured out he has been crused my an evil woman and he
  has to go on a voyage to find out why and how to lift the evil spell. He acquires
  the ability to build an arch and set sails to the high seas to a conquest to get
  back what has been taken from him. The woman he is suppose to eventually end up
  with is in a situation that she hates and continues lies about just to save her
  dignity. Traveling to another country will enable me to write more based on scenery
  and location. I would love to win this trip.
