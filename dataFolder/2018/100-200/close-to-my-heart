Text: This story means me a lot because I just begin to see the nature where all can
  happen means the beauty that I can't remember or visit in my past that place was
  Jammu & kashmir. it's been a good journey of mine because I first go in my area
  to that place.so I just wondered to that moment that this chance is very good for
  me. I have a great weekend and we will have to go back in the nature and find some
  misterious things about the nature.As the days are running out my experience and
  my anxiety is going on very high because of the beauty that I seen.the places such
  like a heaven for me and I am exited to watch the all new and exited things which
  are happening at that time.the best part of that place is the snowfall which is
  totally blank check for me.my title of this story belongs to me 'close to my heart'
  all the small things happen at that time was a great experience for me and I really
  want to happen again and again in my journey of life.
