Text: discover a fishers village, where the life is slowly than in other places, where
  the music is the base, where ocean stuff help to survive, where the clock is just
  a secondary thing, where to laugh is a primary thing, where the power of nature
  captures all the senses, where religion and traditions are mixed really well, where
  dogs wait the sun getting close to stand up, moves about 15 mts and lay down again
  till, where you can go in a bank just with a seaslip, where the fish haven't the
  time to get iced, where a fresh beer is something to venerate. that's a good style
  of life, a good choice of life, a good life!!
