  \ trip on 2014. I was too happy at that time until I want to shared my happiness\
  \ to others so they can feel mine. I shared my itinerary, expense, history, and\
  \ personal tips to all people. I hope everyone will enjoy the trip base on my information.\
  \ Lately, I love to make connection with local. I did it on my South Korea\u2019\
  s trip on Jan 2018. I had experienced on cooking korean food when I was in busan.\n\
  I want to give information so that people have some information to choose which\
  \ place should be visited and what to prepare.\nAnd also it was for myself, I am\
  \ a forgetful person, by this story, I can read my memory later.\nI am on my way\
  \ to write it.\nI always write notes when traveled, and keep all the bill, I want\
  \ to give very clear and correct information.\nAnyway, I love to travel. Love to\
