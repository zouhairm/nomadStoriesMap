Text: "When you\u2019re setting off for a multi-day trek during winter, it\u2019s\
  \ a good idea to pack the essentials \u2013 nothing more. Essentially, the essentials\
  \ are; enough layers to stay warm, a first-aid kit, and a comfortable pair of trekking\
  \ shoes.\n\nI carried a 65L front-loading backpack (click here to check it out,\
  \ there\u2019s a separate bag for men and women). The best feature on this bag is\
  \ the luggage-style opening. Instead of fishing around a top-opening backpack every\
  \ time I needed to find something, I could easily unzip the bag, pick the packing\
  \ cell that contains what I need, zip it back up, and carry on.\n\nThe second best\
  \ part was the section at the top, where I kept a few snacks, my wallet, my camera,\
  \ and my hat. Easy access makes trekking simple.\n\nThe packing list below got me\
  \ through a 6 day, winter* trek to Annapurna Base Camp. If we chose to do Poon Hill\
  \ (an extra two or so days), I still would\u2019ve had enough clothing and supplies\
  \ to get me through."
