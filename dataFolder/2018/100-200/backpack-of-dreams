Text: Driving on terrains is always a tough task especially when you are driving to
  Leh. Leh is a place in India at its northern end. It was my first experience to
  such a high altitude place. The weather was breezy and sensational. The place with
  lots of Indian Army officers and soldiers on the other hand various buddist monks
  in a deep meditation. The place left a great impact on me and i came to know that
  decipline is the key to peace. I still wonder if that fine day while working at
  my office if i would not have decided to go there i would not have been a person
  i am right now. Now i want to run , fly , cry but never stop because aspirations
  are possiblities. Walking so close to clouds, feeling the breeze you feel like let
  the bygones be bygones and focus what is next. Be grateful to what you have. Leh
  is a place that can change the philosophy of a person. You see the true spirit of
  nature. Now i suggest everyone to visit such places where mother nature cuddles
  you. And since then, my Backpack is my truel love.
