Text: Experiencing the loss of a loved one is one of the hardest emotions each person
  can ever experience.  When it rains, sometimes it pours.  That's how it was with
  me when I lost my small family.  I  never knew how hard it was to wake up in the
  morning.  I didn't know what to do, but all I knew was that I had to keep running,
  literally running on a daily basis.  When you don't know what to do, you run.  That
  was my therapy.  The travel came out of entering races to take me away from my everyday
  life, but for me it was experiencing new destinations that my loved ones wanted
  to experience.  They loved to travel together and when I go through my travel bucket
  list, I feel as if they are with me.  Now I know that I can take anything handed
  to me at this point.  I've lost everything except my life, I have also learned that
  each moment of life is precious so I cannot afford to live a life of regret.
