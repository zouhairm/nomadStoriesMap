Text: Hey ! My name is Belinda.im from Florida. I never travel in my life coming to
  Florida from Haiti. The only time I travel was to go to Atlanta Gorgia for a college
  program. In 2017 I did the unexpected. I had a fashion show in L.A , over there
  I walked the runway, meet with my designer, did a photoshot and I also did a meet
  and greet with an agency . I flew over the other side of the U.S by myself with
  no traveling experience or with no one by my side . I was taking a big risk to see
  my chances of one day to being successful and pursuing my dreams . Will I ever do
  that again ? Yes but next time with someone I know.
