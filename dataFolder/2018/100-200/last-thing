Text: I friends my name is suma and, I am a kind of girl who wants to travel around
  thebwotld.  I always want to go different  places to expolre the world. We feel
  very different  anf joyful when we see the new places in these world.  Everyone
  in this world  atleast one's in their life the want to expolre these world, but
  they can't do that,  Because of some reasons but in my case atleast i want explore
  few places in this world.Life is like it always give suptise to us,                 Because  it
  know if every day seems to be same we may feel bore. Life is like a tomorrow  means
  we have no idea about what is waiting for us.  All over my last expectation  from
  life is to have enough strength  to full fill my dreams and expolre these world.
