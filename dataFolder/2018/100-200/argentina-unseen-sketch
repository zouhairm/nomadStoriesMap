Text: 'Travel sketch is always fun, because I can easily meet local people and have
  a chit-chat about something that I draw or sketch. I love to find stories in every
  places that I,ve been visited. I write it in my travel blog and share it through
  every social media. Since I tell the story not only with photos but also sketches,
  then it can make my story looks more fun and artsy.


  Argentina has a lot of stories, not just about daily activities but also people
  and it history. I can feel that Argentina has something in common with my country
  where I belong - Indonesia. So I am so eager to find it out.'
