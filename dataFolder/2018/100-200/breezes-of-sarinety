Text: "I belong to middle class family and there is no surprice i havent even travelled\
  \ my state well. But whenever i am on leave i go to a nearby hill known as kaimur\
  \ hills which is 20 kms away from my house. The fare for there costs rs 20-25\u201A\
  \ so i ask for lifts from good carrier veichles and mange to save my money. But\
  \ it doesnt mean that i am a miser. I visit that hill because that is full of nature.\
  \ I climb on the top and sit there with my legs hanging below in the air. All i\
  \ do is watch the whole town and enjoy the peace their. The cold breezes makes my\
  \ mood so cool that i forget all my tragdies. Sometimes you also get to see herd\
  \ of deers galloping here and there. I love this place and i often visit there because\
  \ it makes me feel diffrent which i cant explain.\nAt last i will say that that\
  \ hill really heals me."
