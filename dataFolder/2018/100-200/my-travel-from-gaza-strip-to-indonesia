Text: "it was really hard call for me to leave Gaza and travel to Indonesia for Education\
  \ reason, waiting Rafah border to open and the stories about this border, traveling\
  \ from the border to Cairo airport and staying in small room in the airport until\
  \ my plane came, from Cairo to Doha to Jakarta, it was the first time for me to\
  \ travel alone, i was arriving to my University in Surabaya city and didnt sleep\
  \ for two whole days, i was really tired, yes that would be my story, Palestinian\
  \ man suffering just to go out from Gaza. Thank you \n\nAhmed ALMadani"
