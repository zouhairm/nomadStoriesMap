Text: 'Today we went on a 3-hour boat ride to a nearby lake which gave us an opportunity
  to observe the Intha tribe in their daily lives, away from touristic attractions.
  We saw once again how fishermen single-leggedly rowed their boats while collecting
  their fishnets and admired women washing their clothes or the dishes in the lake.
  We watched as people eagerly waited on their doorsteps, anticipating the boats bringing
  their kids back from school. We glanced at men and women casually wrapping around
  their traditional skirt: the longyi. Be as voyeuristic as it may, I felt a close
  connection to these people by observing their routines. And as we were having lunch,
  we saw this monk casually making his way to the monastery. Interestingly enough,
  monks seem to be the only plump people in this region. One can''t help but wonder
  what their daily lives entail.
