Text: "The story is about a girl born and brought up in three tiny rooms at the lap\
  \ of the Himalayas-Sikkim. Every morning when she woke up to the scenic mountain\
  \ view in front of her window, she dreamt of flying high and seeing the other side.\
  \ She worked hard, studied well n got a job in a MNC in the city. Her profile gave\
  \ her travel opportunities. Opportunity not just touching on her dream but a lens\
  \ to many more lives in her small town. Her travel stories became the town's pride,\
  \ her video posts - their broadcast, her experiences - their pride. \n\nWhat more\
  \ can a travel mean than to be that telescope which lets people get a feel of the\
  \ view you experience. Travel diaries are nothing but framing memories,  impactful\
  \ only if it touches people's soul - or else it's just a book on a shelf or an article\
  \ in a magazine issue. Help me live this offered travel experience touch many aspiring\
  \ souls. Looking for this opportunity!"
