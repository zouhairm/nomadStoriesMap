Text: "Tulsi is 9 and the school is about to start. During nightfalls on her parents\
  \ Delhi's rooftop, where the white crumbled railing's plaster is well-lighted by\
  \ the street's lights underneath, she reads a lot. She runs out and picks up the\
  \ dailies, choosing always The Hindu and Times of India. Then she reads them, slowly,\
  \ loudly. She takes pride on knowing two alphabets, on keeping such a secret on\
  \ her side. Fo her mother, then, she rereads what has caught her the most. Every\
  \ night, before sleeping, she calls the father. \"Daddy, where are you? Please be\
  \ careful, i read that there...\". On the other end of the phone, Ram, laughs amused,\
  \ just before closing the communication and letting a bit of sadness grow inside.\
  \ I see him, every night, staring at the phone, blank look,  keeping that last smile,\
  \ proud of his little \"dalit\" magic reader. \nI saw him, Ram, every night between\
  \ Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, waiting and answering his daughter's calls, reminding\
  \ to himself way he was doing that."
