Text: "The disheveled man snatched the packet of headache medicine from my hands.\
  \ In one move, he tore it open. He might have used his teeth, I can\u2019t remember.\
  \ \n\n\u201Chey!\u201D My group leader yelled. He was already in the process of\
  \ offering me he newly opened packet.\n\nI stopped her, sobbing.\n\nI made eye contact\
  \ with the man. He seemed to understand. I said \u201Cthank you\u201D a few times,\
  \ knowing that I had forgotten the language but sensing that he understood what\
  \ was happening...perhaps even more than I did.\n\n\nI\u2019ll never forget him.\
  \ It\u2019s as if he knew what I was about to experience. \n\nIn a way, I think\
  \ I became him."
