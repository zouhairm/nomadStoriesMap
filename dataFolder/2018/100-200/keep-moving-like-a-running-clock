Text: "Hi, this is a story of a wanna be explore. Who after undergoing serious health\
  \ issues and social criticism never let go of the true passion to travel and explore.\
  \ Having a law degree in the modern world may not be a big thing, for a poor man\
  \ from a third world country with so many opsticles is an achievement all together.\
  \ \nSome things are immortal, true passion is one of those. Even after facing so\
  \ much difficulties and still protecting the spirit of exploring and a never ending\
  \ quest towards creativity is a thing not to be ignored. \nI believe in being an\
  \ explorer and not a tourist.\nThis being said, I'd like to conclude me short story\
  \ with a hope to be recognized.\nPeace\nThanks."
