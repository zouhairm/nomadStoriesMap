Text: I believe travel is important but whats more important is to take time n live,
  get bored in  single place. Travel is very important visually, To see n experience-
  but to actually feel like home or not to feel like home in a new place is most important.
  Beauty is Beauty. Its present all the time, in everything. Beauty is not ironic,
  not artifacts, not vanity, Its actually a great feeling. When you see something
  beautiful- you know its actually beautiful, because behind it there is so much skill
  or so mu h though or so much of something so perfectly appointed. There are so many
  parametres of beauty, which are super subjective. So, beauty is something you interact
  with, and it gives a great feeling of excitement n joy, it doesnt put you down but
  it makes you feel good about Yourself. And in my case 'Travelling made me a traveller
  not just a tourist'.
