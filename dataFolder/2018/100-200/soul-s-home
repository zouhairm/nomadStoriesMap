Text: "When you travel, you can't know how your adventure could be.\nI studied the\
  \ street of Los Angeles for months, I saw photos of the city every day, but nothing\
  \ could prepare me for the emotions I felt.\nFrom the moment I arrived, I saw everything\
  \ in a way that I could use if I'll live there.\nEvery street could be good for\
  \ walking or running or do shopping.\nEvery people could become a neighbor or an\
  \ help or a lover.\nEvery house could be mine.\nEvery school could be the future\
  \ school of my children. \nEvery day of sun, signed my skin. \nEvery step connected\
  \ me to the floor of that magnificent city. \nYou can see the colors of the heaven\
  \ in the sunset and the lights of the angels in the night from the hills. \nYou\
  \ breathe cultures, cinema, ocean and freedom. \nI had to come back to Rome, but\
  \ I lost my soul in Los Angeles."
