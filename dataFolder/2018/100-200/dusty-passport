Text: "Dusty passport pencil paper life raft.\nI sail tempest of the lonely path,\n\
  mast the mind to a point in time\nthat I can fail forward, releasing time.\n\nExperience,\
  \ the release of experience \nshining sublime lifelong deliverance.\n\nIt is enticing,\
  \ inviting and all the while.\nIt is an embrace, an invite to excitement.\nOur essences\
  \ are free our dreams surreal,\nof rebel tides and of early morning melody flight.\n\
  Traveling upon fantastic nomadic flying kites!\n\nInspiring momentum, back pack\
  \ lite.\nDrifting dawns set alight, poetic pages howl invite.\nThe intense imagination\
  \ intense tonight.\n\nOh the range to imagine!\n\nWeaving perceiving illuminating.\n\
  Reaching feeling communication,\nwhile we relate, arts in the making.\nWe satellites\
  \ revolve nations,\nreveling in the undertaking\nsavor the tales reciprocating.\n\
  \nWith the caring creative and captivating."
