Text: 'Travelling..!!! This is best thing one could do. Not only I will get amazing
  experiences through it but also I will get to see the wonders around the world.
  This is the only thing I will love to do for the rest of my life (apart from eating).

  I''ve been studying engineering from the past 3 years. Not knowing about what other
  careers there are around I took engineering. I have always loved to explore new
  places, meet new friends, understand different cultures, eat different food. But
  I got stuck in engineering.  I was not at all liking what I was doing because of
  which now I got a drop from college. Even now if I wish to start travelling I will
  not be able to afford it. From 2 years I have been making a list of places that
  I want to travel in future, more like a bucket list you can say. I hope that I get
  to visit all the places. I will be forever grateful to you, if I get this chance.
  It will be the best start for my travel writing.'
