Text: "Mesmerized by the beauty of ancient art,  i was walking down the streets of\
  \ small town in India. That affection in everyone's eye whom I passed,  made me\
  \ feel the comfort like a family. \nI have no snaps of that time because the beauty\
  \ of everything that i passed, did not want to miss through naked eye.\nIt was time\
  \ to calm down the hunger. I went to a restaurant and was waiting for someone to\
  \ take my order.  I looked around the sparkling lights that were used to decorate\
  \ the DHABA but nothing could beat the lights from the twinkling stars. \nSuddenly\
  \ a kid came to me,  his smile was like it will make you forget all dark sides of\
  \ life. I was trying to communicate with the kid in his local language 'Hindi' but\
  \ thing that stunned me was when he started speaking my local language  'Chinese'.\
  \  He knew 10 languages in total. \nHe told his father was a tourist guide and his\
  \ father interacted with people from across the globe. And the kid learned all through\
  \ his observations. \n\n\nKnowledge is observation and beauty is surroundings."
