Text: On the flight from Washington to Phoenix, I met Kathy, a nurse from Phoenix,
  Arizona. My looks,  that says I am definitely not American, ignited her curiosity
  and for the entire 5-hour flight, Kathy bombarded me with questions about my religion,
  country,  traditions and culture. Questions were in the air and I happily answered
  them all. Kathy was a very nice person to talk to and shows respect to people's
  differences and diversity, she told me about her family and job and I enjoyed listening
  to her.  That is why before we land in Phoenix, I gave her a small gift, the three
  pyramids and Sphinx. We still enjoy listening to each other's stories till now.
