Text: 'My story begins with meditation, and the decision to travel after finishing
  my studies. I decided to travel to Czeck Republic to work as a volunteer.  In my
  trip I not only discover a new country, I also found a new me. I got in touchwith
  nature, I challenged myself to adventure, to travel around Europe on my own. I went
  to London, I extended my trip, from 3 months to 8 months. I met people from all
  over the world. I got lost, and I found myself. I discovered I could be brave. I
  found myself free from conditionings, I allowed myself to fall and to get up without
  filling disappointed.

  I worked out some issues with past relationships, I started writing a book, I did
  embroidery, pottery, started playing the guitar and the armonio, a traditional instrument
  from India.'
