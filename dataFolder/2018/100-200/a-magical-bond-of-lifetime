Text: 'Sometimes Life is experiencing dual realities and sometimes even walking on
  the precarious thread which might break loose on slight swaying. Success/failure,
  happiness/sadness, ease/hardships are a part of life and not what defines your life.
  What you are, is a reality and what you have, is myth. Holding onto the fading moments
  of glory or severe blow, is living your life in past, in delusion. What you have
  in front of you in the present moment is your reality. Thus life is much, much bigger
  than these passing moments of success/failure, happiness/sadness. Yes they do define
  the course of your life, the path you will tread on but not YOU. Your identity is
  beyond all this.


  You are defined by what craft you create, how you uplift people, how you make others
  feel, how you impact and influence their life in positive way, how you connect with
  locals ,the kind, compassionate and warm you are. What defines you and your purpose
  of life is what you give to this world. And that alone matters in life.'
