Text: "How could we go from a small town near the Hudson\u2019s Bay to a life in Hollywood\
  \ and end up going to every state in America and Province in Manitoba by the age\
  \ of 30? Most people don\u2019t even leave the community of Manitoba. Somehow London\
  \ had some appeal.. there was something magic about the city. The rain and the history.\
  \ \n\nI remember telling my Dad at a young age that I hated small town life. There\
  \ was something about the big city and tall buildings, when I was 16 I ended up\
  \ in Boston for an ice hockey tournament and something magical came over me. I felt\
  \ like I could sit in a coffee shop with a pen and a pad and somehow be content,\
  \ day after day, drop after drop. \n\nWriting in most scenarios wasn\u2019t for\
  \ me. I didn\u2019t have the patience. I still don\u2019t. I need to go see something.\
  \ I need to LOOK! DO! Be a PART of it! Maybe that comes from the hockey. \n\nMaybe\
  \ my story is living rather than writing. How does this all collide?"
