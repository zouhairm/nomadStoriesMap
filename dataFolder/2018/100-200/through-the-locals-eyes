Text: "Greece.... in all my travels as a nomadic Australian I never encouted a country\
  \ so rich in culture, beautiful scenery and party hard people. There are so many\
  \ stories how to I begin the time i quad biked santorini on quad, jumping off cliffs\
  \ in beautiful crystal clear water on a black beach, or maybe the time I party till\
  \ I dropped in Mykonos but my by far favourite was milos a tiny island that is the\
  \ locals secret. Milos has beautiful white cliffs that match those of England\u2019\
  s Dover, and there little church on there hill in the sunset is spectacular but\
  \ I arrived in time for there fire jumping pit which I highly recommend. The Greek\
  \ men run and jump over fire \U0001F525 in the middle of the road, watching the\
  \ embers burn in the night while they jump over it is a amazing sight not only is\
  \ it a great way to lose the hair on your legs but it sets the tone of the night\
  \ with locals eating Greek cuisine and singing loudly into the night, Milos first\
  \ of September 2017 I\u2019ll never forget it"
