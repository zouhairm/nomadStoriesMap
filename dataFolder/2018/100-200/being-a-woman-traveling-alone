Text: "Being a woman in Latin America can be really hard. As a travel lover, sometimes\
  \ being \"alone\" is a bad thing. Why do we need to keep standing for this? Why\
  \ is so dangerous to leave my comfort zone and just meet new places, people, etc.\
  \ \n\nAll the time I am trying to make a personal experience there's someone asking:\
  \ Who are you going with? If the answer is by myself, the comment will be always\
  \ the same: too risky, too dangerous, get a boyfriend, don't go and the list can\
  \ just go on.\n\nI've never been in Argentina, I would love to. I would love to\
  \ make a long trip from Mexico to Argentina to prove not only what women can do,\
  \ but also that traveling by our own doesn't need to be a dangerous adventure."
