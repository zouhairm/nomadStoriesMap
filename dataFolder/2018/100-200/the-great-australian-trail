Text: "Australian's are widely known for our sporting prowess, our countryside for\
  \ it's natural beauty. Despite this, we are without an equivalent to The CDT/PCT/Trans\
  \ Canadian Trail; a national hiking trail. Starting at our southern most point;\
  \ Southeast Cape in Tasmania, I plan to run along The Great Divide all the way to\
  \ Cape York. Along the way I will visit numerous UNESCO sites and Sites of Special\
  \ Scientific Interest, not to mention countless epic vistas.\nI aim not only to\
  \ create a National hiking trail, but to learn the cultural history of the regions\
  \ through which I pass. I will also throw a spotlight upon threatened species and\
  \ their habitats and the importance of doing all we can to protect what can never\
  \ be recovered once lost.\n\n\nYours Sincerely, \nSteven Monohan."
