Text: Early last year me and a few friends had a hairbrain scheme of going on a road
  trip all together even though only I had my license and it was my learners and not
  even having a car at the time, being young and silly we decided to save up and book
  a place in Hastings because it was cheap the last place we expected to go. Closer
  to the time we all started having second thoughts but the time came around and me,
  my partner and two others hoped into my mums two door tiny car and on the way we
  were it was boiling like 30 degrees in the middle of the summer. When we arrived
  no one was home but we had finally made it at last
