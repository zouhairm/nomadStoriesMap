Text: "On February 3, 2018, began my adventure in Morocco. It was my first time out\
  \ of America and I was very excited to get to know a totally different culture.\
  \ the last thing I expected was that I couldn't communicate in a country speaking\
  \ English. Morocco was the country that surprised me a lot, as I didn't know much\
  \ about the country, I started to read some travel blogs that many of them spoke\
  \ bad things about the country and the population, but I had an incredible surprise\
  \ on this trip, because the people, the culture and the landscapes of this place\
  \ impressed me a lot on the positive side. The best experience of my life was camping\
  \ in the Sahara desert, where I certainly had the coldest night of my life, but\
  \ the most special. \nThis trip was very special for me because it impressed me\
  \ and I learned a lot with it, about the culture, religion, and customs of that\
  \ people and for everything I read about this place in various blogs, honestly,\
  \ I did not expect that this would be the most incredible trip of my life."
