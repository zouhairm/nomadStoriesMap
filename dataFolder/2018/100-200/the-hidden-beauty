Text: My travel story started when i first stepped out of the volvo in manali,it was
  memorable and still fresh in my mind.first time i felt the beauty of hills,fresh
  cold air,aroma of the greenery was awesome.after travelling with nausea,it refreshed
  me.I was touched deeply by the beauty of nature,i was speechless n could not express
  in words.Although travel was pathetic due to motion sickness but the beauty of nature
  was more effective.I am a sensitive and an emotional person...like i can say i always
  wanted to be there but didnt knew it...I could feel the power,beauty,fragrance,flora,fauna,hills
  and everything .The lifestyle of the people there,tradition they follow,the attractions
  of tourists was awesome..the cold breeze,hotel rooms without fans,trees and mountains
  all around gave me a total different feeling...actually it was a pleasure of travelling,pleasure
  of coming out from ur daily boring routine,coming out from worries and tensions
  and enjoying...I thank God that he gave me such a beautiful Life,God gave me the
  chance to explore myself and explore the world.I thank god for giving me all the
  blessings and treasures that i have...I AM GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE,I AM AND I
  WILL LIVE A LIFE LESS ORDINARY.
