Text: A young woman travels to the beautiful country of Argentina for an immersion
  teaching program. She wants to make peace with her troubled past, and move forward
  after a very difficult break-up. While she is there, she meets an older woman who
  transforms her view of the world and teaches her the importance of humility. She
  learns that wisdom is based shared best by those who have journeyed through hell
  to find redemption. This is a story about love, loss and family. The vivid imagery
  will help readers envision the beautiful Argentinian landscape and plan a vacation
  of their own to discover the great adventure awaiting our main character!
