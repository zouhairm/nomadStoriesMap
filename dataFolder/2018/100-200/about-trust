Text: 'You always know the beginning of the story but no eon can tell you the end
  till it ends.

  Hitchhiking around Thailand I Had had the chance to meet lots of amazing families
  but the most important thing I discover was that humans are good and we are all
  looking for  connection with others.

  Picked up by a man that knew no word of english at all. He called his wife and give
  me the phone to explain to her where I was heading to, after that hw stopped at
  a gas station asked for a piece of cardboard and wrote in Thai the name of the lace
  that I was going to and drop me off after an hour diving in the connection with
  the road I needed, giving me his wife phone number in case I need any help. Ended
  up criying in the middle of the road becausebof feeling so grateful with humany
  and with life.

  Never stop trusting, nomad life is full of love on the road.'
