Text: 'Hey guys,

  Recently I visited "bijapur, Karnataka, India".

  Very less people know about this place. this place is all about Heritage sites and
  culture. lots of mosques, forts, and palace. people started making fun of main when
  i said that I''m gonna visit this place. but when i went and explore that place!
  that place stole my heart! fabulous Architecture and designs of mosques and palace.
  so peaceful and positive vibes. Their local people were also calm and helpful. and
  best thing is that started growing in tourism base. people started visiting this
  place. and it''s duty to know about our own culture. that people, that place, that
  ancient things are so mysterious. that place was So amazing. I can''t tried of thinking
  About this yet. And that palce motived me to visit more historical places in India.
  And India is Famous for Heritage sites. so I''ll visit more places soon. Even I
  love to explore Beach sites. I love sitting alone on beach writing about my travel
  experience.'
