Text: "I\u2019ve made the Banff craft beer festival a yearly weekend event for the\
  \ past two years. I sent out with my neighbor Lorenzo a big Italian firefighter\
  \ from Edmonton and this year we took his truck. Which was nice cause I got to sit\
  \ back and enjoy the  scenery of the foothills of Calgary which open up into the\
  \ mountains of Banff. Nothing like a couple of beers and the stark contrast of the\
  \ mountains and blue skies. We checked into our hotel, which was pretty cheap for\
  \ Banff standards. We made our way across the street to the Keg our favorite steak\
  \ house. A seat at the bar, steak and a hockey game is a great start to a Canadian\
  \ weekend. \nBanff was full of happy go lucky beer drinkers and our next stop was\
  \ the Rose N Crown. Great live music and cold beer. Ages range from 18 to 70 a carefree\
  \ Friday night had begun....."
