Text: Losing my heart and mind to the Bulgarian mountains was easy. If something was
  hard, it was finding my way back after losing my Lenovo K3 which must play the song
  of the mountains for a ringtone now. The only person who came on his tour with me-Marco,
  an ardent trekking enthusiast left me far behind and I had no way of contacting
  the guide or him without my phone. Plus to get back to the parking lot from the
  10,000ft high glacial mountains required me to operate a chair-lift. It being a
  first-time experience didn't help and doing it myself without instructions in English
  would have been impossible. But signaling my request to the only local in vicinity
  to take me down on the chair eased the seemingly daunting task. Together we sailed
  above pine trees and the gentle breeze brewed an unspoken bond in 10 minutes.  Given
  the circumstances, I merely expressed my gratitude with a smile when we went our
  ways because all my troubles didn't end there. I was still stranded in a remote
  region on the Balkan Plateau, but that tale is for another day.
