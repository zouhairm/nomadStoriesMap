Text: "I was on the plane of the universe\nA lot of blessed dreams disolved into water,\n\
  The biggest dream was to have everything in order, next step was part of my imagination\
  \ when i was dreaming.\nI used to kiss dreams so hard I became the dream when I\
  \ found my real family in Texas, I thought a lot of things when I saw mom crying,\
  \ so happy .. She was so happy to see me again, the first flight of my life looking\
  \ for answers. I found me blessed, no one has two family\u2019s, two mom\u2019s\
  \ .. if you think so deeply no one is thankful for every dream.\nWhen I am dreaming\
  \ I am awake, I take my soul for a tour of emotions, I am very emotional, I feel\
  \ passion when I have the tools, mom is not a tool, I am the tool."
