Text: "I went with 15 journalists on a difficult adventure to the desert of the Dead\
  \ Sea. We walked at night 15 kilometers on foot to shoot the sunrise over the Dead\
  \ Sea. On the way we explored the animals, the desert creatures, their deep history\
  \ and mysterious secrets.\nThe main thread in my story was going to photograph the\
  \ sun, and from there to other lines as we walked, talking about the scorpions,\
  \ birds and caves that we found on our way to the sun, I will attach to you with\
  \ the written text a short film video about the journey, I did not expect the story\
  \ to spread throughout the world, But the subject fascinated people because they\
  \ did not expect a journalist to walk 15 kilometers to bring them a different story.\n\
