Text: "I was at school in the library studying with my best friends. I got a random\
  \ message from my friend on Facebook saying \u201C do you know anyone who would\
  \ like to go on a free trip to Spain?\u201D I was so down for the trip so I told\
  \ her I wanted to go! So she was able to tell me all the details of the trip so\
  \ I agreed and me and my best friend went on the trip of out lives. I thought I\
  \ would go to Europe sometime in my life but not for free and to meet FC Barcelona.\
  \ We got to stay at the renaissance in Barcelona, got to train with the Barcelona\
  \ coaches and even go to a game as well. And if it wasn\u2019t for my friend I would\
  \ have never gone on this trip."
