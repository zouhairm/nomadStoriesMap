Text: 'I don''t remember his name. He had what you''d probably call legs but they
  were no use to him though he still had to bring them around everywhere. He had two,
  like, blackboard dusters that he dragged himself around with and a rictus grin on
  half his face. I shared the last of my weed and food with him and he wept a bit
  from human contact.


  We hung out for a while until he had to go do his begging and scoring thing and
  he didn''t want me to see him like that so we had a bit of a hug and he fucked off.
  I suppose that he''s dead now. I was somewhere in my early 20''s then and he was
  probably in his late 40''s. So it goes.


  Let''s just presume he got help and legs and is happily married with children and
  working with refugees ar the jungle in Calais. Let''s say his name is Jim, pronounced
  ''Zheem'', but the kids at the jungle call him Papa Oiseau because he can make the
  sound of any bird you want.'
