Text: "The last thing I expected that my trip would have finished in the passport\
  \ control because of incorrect work of fingerprint scanner and could have ruined\
  \ my plans of meeting with my friends in Riga. It was rather funny to lose a chance\
  \ of seeing Latvia, having valid Schengen visa, pre-paid hotel and dense cultural\
  \ program of visiting beautiful places and enjoying fresh air of the Baltic Sea\
  \ shore with unique gifts like amber. Such waiting at the border\u2019s checkpoint\
  \ astonished me very much, because only 2 months earlier, in neighbor upon Estonia,\
  \ which had granted me this entry visa, nobody asked my fingerprints at all. Moreover,\
  \ I had to pass biometric control again, when I left Riga. Fortunately, my returning\
  \ Moscow was without problem, though some years ago, I was surprised when my passport\
  \ had been analyzed thoroughly, then the officer consulted with colleagues and checked\
  \ my passport again. I started to worry that I would be sent back to Europe and\
  \ I wouldn\u2019t be able to come home and see my Motherland again..."
