Text: 'Iko - a Japanese Ameican - leaves the states with one intention: to get away.
  To escape. To disappear into a land of the unknown where nobody could even speak
  Ila''s tongue. But as soon as Iko arrives in the small far-off Portugues farming
  village, she has a feeling it won''t be quite as easy as she first thought. The
  town is full of friendly faces, eager to smile and help Iko carry luggage. Then,
  when Iko arrives at the  AirBNB she booked on a whim, her whole plan comes unglued.
  The host, Kai, greets her in Japanese -- the language of Iko''s grandparents. And
  while she doesn''t understand exactly what Kai says, she knows the language of the
  blush she can''t ignore. But will passion and a forgein place be enough to Iko to
  leave behind the ghosts of a tattered heart-broken past she was trying to stamp
  down by leaving town? Or do the ghosts follow us wherever we go? Do they root us
  to our heritage no matter how far we run? And, if acknowledged, can reaching  out
  help dispell those ghosts and open our hearts to a wider, kinder world?'
