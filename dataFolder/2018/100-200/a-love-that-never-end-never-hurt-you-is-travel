Text: "There is nothing quite like traveling, like seeing a new place for the first\
  \ time or returning to a favorite place. People of all ages, from all countries,\
  \ travel to foreign places for many different reasons \u2013 namely work, family\
  \ and leisure. Whether by plane, train, ship or automobile, travel is generally\
  \ a pleasurable experience, at least for the people who can financially afford comfortable\
  \ and safe methods of travel. But it has more benefits than satisfying one\u2019\
  s need to make money, as well as to see loved ones and enjoy one\u2019s self on\
  \ vacation. There are other benefits of traveling that many people often overlook."
