Text: 'The trip started off right with a magical sunset flying into Osaka and a huge
  star shaped cloud in the middle .

  As soon as I landed I felt the hot summer breeze on my face and spotted flowers
  in every corner of the city. I arrived to this traditional Japanese wooden house
  and felt too cozy I knew the days would get more interesting and that I had to extend
  my visit .

  As I walked around parks and temples everything inspired me and that sense of malinchonia
  would go away..the more I walked the more I thought ...like time had stopped and
  stress dissapeared.

  I felt safe . Each day took me to a different location discovering myself and the
  amazing culture it was like rebirth each day'
