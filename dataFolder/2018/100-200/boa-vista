Text: "Boa Vista\n\nI only know half of what\u2019s happening in the world. Half.\
  \ \n\nTwo girls, my age. Venezuela. \n\nThey ran. They flew from their country,\
  \ where there is no water, electricity, air. \n\nThere\u2019s war. Fights. No food.\
  \ Hunger. \n\nI offer them what\u2019s left of my food. \n\nEggs, rice, beans. Water.\
  \ \n\nThey eat, plenty. \n\nWhere do you go next, I ask. We don\u2019t know, they\
  \ say. \n\nThere\u2019s no home to return to, no more. \n\nAnd your parents, I ask.\
  \ In Venezuela, they say. They told us to go, elsewhere, where there is work, maybe,\
  \ a better future, for us. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what to say, next. \n\nSo I listen.\
  \ Carefully. \n\nI feel spoiled. \n\nEuropean, low-budget, brave. \n\nNothing compared\
  \ to what these girls are going through. Will be going through, if they want to\
  \ make a living. Here. Elsewhere. Anywhere. \n\nNo college education, barely finished,\
  \ high school. \n\nStill, they smile, continue going. \n\nThey sit, watch, wait\
  \ for what\u2019s next. \n\nA future.  \n\nAny possible future. \n\nWill do. \n\n\
  And you, how do you do?"
