Text: Hi there ,my travels began back in 2017 , I travelled to Cyprus and I had to
  have a major operation/surgery  over there as I had a herniated disc in my lower
  lumbar spine , thankfully the doctors where successful with the operation and I'm
  able to walk perfectly again as I couldn't before , I've met some amazing people
  and experienced amazing places and things , made new friends over there and it made
  me really think about life and how vulnerable the body can be and  that I really
  would love to travel to different regions and go on different adventures  experiencing
  amazing things  with beautiful people and seeing different cultures and their customs.
