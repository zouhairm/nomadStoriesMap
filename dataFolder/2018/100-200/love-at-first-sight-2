Text: "Since childhood I had a list of countries I want to travel when I get older\
  \ , on the second position it was united kingdom. The day finally came November\
  \ 2016 I was ready to take off for my dream city for one month and nothing more\
  \ than excitement I had , the moment I landed I could smell the after rain air and\
  \ cold breeze hit my face suddenly the realisation struck me what everyone keeps\
  \ talking about \u201CLondon Weather\u201D that I am here . \nI sat in my car to\
  \ head to my accomodocation , my heart was pounding and I had a biggest smile on\
  \ my face that my dream is coming true , you know wanna know when love at first\
  \ sight happen when I saw big ben and london eye this was it I have finally made\
  \ it where my heart belong . It has been long that I am back from london but one\
  \ thing hasnt returned and that is my heart ."
