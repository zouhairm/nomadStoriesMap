Text: I always be busy to learning english. So I decided (finally) to study english
  on my own way (going to Scotland -UK-) about a week to learn the local habits, the
  language and their culture. I am looking also tho walk some lanscapes in the Highlands,
  then to meet people in Edinburgh. Without learning grammar or prononciation, I will
  try to do my best with language skills in UK. Then I want to keep writting about
  my experiences around Europe and around the world. I am planing to publish a book
  telling my experiences and encourage people to travel backpacking (in a cheap way)
  around the world; Without learning any languages or habits.
