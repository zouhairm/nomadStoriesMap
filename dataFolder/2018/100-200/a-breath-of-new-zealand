Text: "Welcome to Aotearoa New Zealand the land of the long white cloud. Take a seat\
  \ kick of your jandals and embark on a journey through middle earth and all the\
  \ enchanting sites nature and New Zealand has to offer. I have been completely blown\
  \ away by the waterfalls and untouched scenery in fiordland, the rolling green hills\
  \ and farmland accompanied by local Maori traditions in Rotorua, and to have experienced\
  \ a kayak on the clearest lake on earth located in Nelson\u2019s national park.\
  \ Only a few breathtaking adventures! But words cannot describe this beautiful corner\
  \ of the world. So take a deep breath, take your time and embrace nature like you\u2019\
  ve never seen it before..."
