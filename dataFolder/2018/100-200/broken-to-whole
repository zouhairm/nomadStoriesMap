Text: "I had always dreamed of traveling at a young age but as you know life sometimes\
  \ gets in the way.  At at 25 I thought I was on track to fulfill the American dream.\
  \  A wife, kids, picket fence home but it was not in the cards for me.  My love\
  \ left me and I was alone at 40 with the pieces of the broken dream.  I was at the\
  \ point where I though it was all so futile and decided to sell everything I had\
  \ and travel the world.   Wouldn\u2019t you know it, the dream I had when I was\
  \ young was the life changing if experience I needed at 40.  I have been traveling\
  \ ever since, and now approaching 45 I have visited 28 countries, meet lifelong\
  \ friends along the way and have no desire to stop anytime soon.  Dreams can change\
  \ in the blink of an eye, you can either choose to wallow in misery or choose another\
  \ dream."
