Text: The story starts with me, the simple 28 yr old Kiwi (New Zealand) girl, who
  has never travelled further than australia. Her dreams and aspirations long to seek
  adventure in other countries, but her limitations are the comforts of home... Especially
  her bedroom! She works for a world renowned airline, that flys passengers from one
  end of the globe, to the next... But yet, she has not ventured herself! She checks
  passports, boards 1000s of customers on these flights daily, to 100s of destinations
  all over the world, but yet her travels last as long as her drive to the airport
  for work.  She seeks adventure, watches the planes arrive and then depart with her
  dreams of travel.
