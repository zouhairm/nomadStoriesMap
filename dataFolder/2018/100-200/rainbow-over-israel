Text: "The sands cover the earth with no beach or shore in sight. Miles of history\
  \ plagued with distain and animosity towards mankind. I sat there on a plane ride\
  \ back to my home country where my blood runs thick, my history short lived. I was\
  \ born in this small country but have moved to many parts of the Americas only to\
  \ return and realize how American I really am. Connected by virtue but separated\
  \ by perception, my family and I couldn\u2019t agree on a single verse from the\
  \ Bible or a single trait of what makes a person a terrorist. I walked the sands\
  \ of the desert alone, pondering what a connection to the earth would look like.\
  \ What would make me an Israeli born, was not an action but simply the criticism\
  \ of its nature and appreciation of its horizon. I loved this small country, from\
  \ it I came, from it I grow."
