Text: 'Fist time I flew to Morocco to explore beauty of country and culture.

  The weather was really hot, I stayed in Marrakesh, a proper traditional city always
  buzzing with tourists from all around the world.many people buy spices overhere
  especially safron and cinnamon. Moroccan are well known for their traditional kitchen
  specialities like  tagine which I absolutely love. Also it''s one of those countries
  left with king. History is amazing, also their beaches are very popular.people are
  so friendly. You know sometimes Europeans and Americans are sceptical to travel
  to Muslim countries but this place is one of the safest and kindest places I have
  been to..I can''t wait to go back this summer for yoga and surfing classes.'
