Text: I always cherish visiting historical places. I choose Jaipur the Pink City the
  best to explore and to see all the historical art things. I visited the Famous Amer
  Fort. Its mesmerizing beauty was something unsual. I visited the famous hawa mahal.
  Its awsome with sooo many little windows and I was wondering how it was made. The
  city gave me feeling as if I am the princess. My next stop was the Nahargarh fort
  m. The amazing beauty and the amazing structures were something to be talked about.
  Jaipur was the best destination i have ever travelled with soo much to learn about
  the past and it gives a royal feeling too.
