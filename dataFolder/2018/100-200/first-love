Text: "I met the Caves of Perua\xE7u in 2016, a unique and incredible place until\
  \ June of that year had never heard about this charming place and at the same time\
  \ so simple. It is a place where you can connect with your own self, where feelings\
  \ come out in a different way, it is love at first sight, and with each new visit\
  \ you discover new things and connect with the place in a unique way. Carves of\
  \ Perua\xE7u is a place that marked a stage of my life and is part of my life now,\
  \ the world should know this preciousness that the North of Minas Gerais has. The\
  \ North of Minas Gerais is a unique land of people who take care of their difficulties\
  \ facing the life of head held high with the certainty that faith does not fail\
  \ to fail, place of simple people, dreamers, struggle people who welcome people\
  \ with open arms and a big smile in the face, where the heart overflows with happiness\
  \ and always fits one more, maybe that's why I'm in love with Carves of Perua\xE7\
  u, because this place can pass all this feeling through nature implicitly and explicitly."
