Text: I dont travel to see new places i travel to nurture my soul,the verdure always
  captured my soul the sea breezes captured my body and heart of mine beated in a
  harmony . I became an exclamatory over and over again whenever i visit a new place
  . Standing at the present i travel to past aswell as future . Well when past gave
  me immense pleasure while future gets me to be worried a little , the histories
  always made me wonder than future does so i think the earth and its heritages are
  meant to explore for me with its full throttle, each and every place i travelled
  has its own specialities its own mood and its own history which always made me curious
  and this curiousity of mine will drive me to the every point of the earth my thirst
  to feel nature all alone is enough to fuel it up !
