  My website is my story. It began in September 2014, when I separated from my husband
  and left Canada to start a new life. Where? I had no clue, so I packed my bag and
  started travelling, while hopping from house sit to house sit in various countries.
  To cope with my divorce, I started writing and taking endless pictures. I noticed
  I loved my hobby and by now I wrote more than 80 blog pages, illustrated with many
  pictures. Finally, I ended up in the Netherlands, my official home country, which
  I had left for 24 years. Although I now reside in a tiny town called Lochem, I still
  will continue travelling, as it is in my genes. My daughter lives in Sydney, Australia
  and my son in the Rocky Mountains, Canada. At this very moment, I am visiting Sydney
  for the first time.'
