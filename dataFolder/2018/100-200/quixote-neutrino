Text: Silver road runner, broke, 2 packs of cigarrettes a day, woke up with a dream
  of a travelling star, thought it was what he believed was the most high price of
  Bitcoin shinning high as the end of the world and he followed it to The Andes, through
  the joking wavings and buckings of the Pampa prairies with the usual politic fate
  of Argentina like tectonic grooves. The character with a faithful dog, Panchita,
  going north, to the poor and spiritual province of Santiago del Estero to visit
  Godmother Theresa, the purest person he ever knew has become a dream analist; so
  with his diary of dreams the character faces the bizarre landscape of a nation as
  a Golem of many facets he must tame.
