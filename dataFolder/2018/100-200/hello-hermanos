Text: 'When I was in Argetina, I went on a cruise, I had less than 8 hours to know
  what I could before my ship sailed. Imagine the anxiety! I wanted to know everything
  and everyone, to shop, to eat in the best places. We arrived early, I landed like
  crazy, I ran in the terminal, contrateium taxi and closed a value for him to take
  me in 4hrs in as many places as I could, we started by Palermo, what a place, what
  a park, a new world, roses, swans, I loved it. Then we went to Bomboneira, Boca
  stadium, I could not get in, it was closed, but I saw outside and I pictured myself
  inside in an exciting final match. I could not stop going to Calle Florida, to buy
  my delicious alfajores and perfumes, at last we went to Caminito, to dance a tango,
  with pink right in the mouth, haha.

  It was a quick but unforgettable trip, I will return to visit my Hermanos, for sure.'
