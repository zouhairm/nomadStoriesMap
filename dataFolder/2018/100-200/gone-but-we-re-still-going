Text: I am 21 years old as I sit and type this, my dream goal is to save money and
  explore a little of Zimbabwe as it's where my closest friend Innocent Rusenza lived
  before moving to the U.K. He was someone so dear to me despite our differences,
  we were brothers from different countries and he was an excellent man and a great
  friend. Sadly in 2015 he lost a hard fight that we had no clue he was fighting and
  on February 7th he committed suicide and left us one message, "what I'm about to
  say will hurt for the rest of your lives, I am sorry" then just like that the best
  man I knew was gone and so much of me died with him. I promised my friend we would
  go to his home country and seek out adventure perhaps in hope bringing us closer
  to our lost brother, all I can do is tell you the start of the story, it's fate
  that'll make it's end.
