Text: "I went to Spain in 2008. I went on a whim and worked for a family that owned\
  \ an English school named the British owl. Long story short I just didn\u2019t have\
  \ time to adjust to the transit, etc to fulfill the requirements of the job, so\
  \ I was let go. With the help of one of the teachers, I advertised for someone to\
  \ help me learn Spanish. I met Lorena at a cappuccino bar and we hit it off very\
  \ well. She introduced me to her small family of friends and they all gathered around\
  \ and to have traditional Spanish food and it was an evening to remember. We all\
  \ laughed and I felt more at home than I ever did back in Canada. It was wonderful."
