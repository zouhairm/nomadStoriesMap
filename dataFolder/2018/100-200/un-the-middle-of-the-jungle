Text: 'It was a long trip. We had to travel by car during 3 hours. We were 10 at the
  car, that had a van at the end. It was incredible how the jungle started to open
  before us. The day was beginning, and the Sky was full of new colours.

  Since that moment i knew It was going to be antes unforgettable day.

  When we arrived to the village, It was cold, but they were almost unclothed. They
  were wearing the most sincerely smiling i have never seen before.

  During all the day weekend connected with them. We didn''t speak the same language,
  but It wasn''t neccesary.'
