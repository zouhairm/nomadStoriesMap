Text: Jesus had no place to rest his head. I want to follow Jesus across the world
  to see people ilencounter the real messiah. The messiah that is still living today
  and to see miracles in Europe. I wanted to go on a journey at age 23 years old that
  would later change my life drastically. What does it look like for a young American
  woman to leave everything behind and soon discover she has found everything in the
  self discovery. Through seeing a work bigger than my own and to trust God with only
  50 dollars in my pockets. What does it look like to fully trust God with your finances
  like the apostles did in the Bible. Is the church really living radically like they
  should. Could Americans pay down their comfortable lives to see others transformed
  by the Holy Spirit. This is my story. Let me please share it with the world and
  more importantly let me share it with a self indulging planet. Jesus will return
  soon and don't you want to be found ready?
