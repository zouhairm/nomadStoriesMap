Text: "It doesn't really matter\nIf is God that plants the stars in the sky in front\
  \ of my eyes\nOr if the cards are played so I would be crazy enough to think that\
  \ that's a gift\nMade with love, from the Lover -\nI still fall in love with them\
  \ every time I feel alive\nAnd still thank God for giving me so much more than I\
  \ deserve.\n\nBut then again, who could do enough \nTo deserve free will and a lifetime\
  \ with all the possibilities in the world \nTo dream about love as much \nAs being\
  \ loved from the big coincidence of existence?\n\nThey still shine whether you see\
  \ them or not\nAnd I spend all of my time loving them,\nLoving me and loving you."
