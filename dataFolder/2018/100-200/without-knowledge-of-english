  home was not possible I began to fall into depression. Deciding to leave I did not
  understand where and how I did not know what language except Kazakh. But I decided

  alone alone. It was scary he sense of new and interesting forced.But no matter what,
  I drove to the university myself to travel all over China. I've seen a lot of people.
  And even one day spent the night on Vogzale. But the result of all, has caused me
  a mad desire to see something new, something unknown. It's not really a new feeling
  that I'm not at home and where the Doleko where there is no one I liked so much
