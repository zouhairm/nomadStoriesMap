Text: "It all starts by a thought of exploring my and   my india's limits. I am out\
  \ to discover why this was my birthplace?? and i wanted to get its limit via my\
  \ view.\nI always wanted to go out and meet everything that existed on this soil,and\
  \ deliver it to everyone with my own twist.\nMeeting different people is not a big\
  \ deal but meeting their different thoughts and emotions is something exciting.\n\
  Seeing different views is nothing but delivering the freshness of scenes for long\
  \ term to the audience is the real success of one's journey.\nKnowing about India\
  \ is not a great task ,you can google it or you can watch its views on you tube\
  \ ..but if you want to feel and live in India for some moment then its possible\
  \ by my travel story...\nIts being real and blend of different cultures with the\
  \ spycyness of views and emotions to create a long lasting effect on one's heart\
