Text: 'Pick up a couple of bags, comfortable tennis, a notebook and lots of water
  are the perfect weapons to undertake a trip around the world. A world beyond the
  beautiful hotels, luxurious shopping and gourmet food. A trip that becomes experience
  when traveling the truth. That truth that hide the smiles of children and the roughness
  of the hands of the locals who earn their living day to day in that area. They are
  the best guides, those who show you their traditional food, their way their life
  and the best plans for all budgets.


  Argentina, representative of Latin America is one of those countries that hide so
  many stories beyond tourism, beyond what is normally shown.


  The journey begins like this, crossing little streets, markets and visiting those
  places not photographed, not counted but that hide the essence of Argentina in all
  its corners.'
