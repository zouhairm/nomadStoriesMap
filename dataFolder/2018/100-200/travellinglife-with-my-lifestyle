Text: "Hiii!!!! I'm(Mulla virendranath) from vishakapatnam i.e., INDIAN COUNTRY. In\
  \ my life there is no chance for me to travel all over the world\U0001F30D. I expect\
  \ everyone wants to enjoy their life as well as I to want to spend my life through\
  \ travelling once in a time. I like the places (ex: london, newyork, Singapore,\
  \ malaysia, America, dubai). I like London very much that my friends and my cousins\
  \ said, that it was loveable place. So, I expect through this winning competition\
  \ I will enjoy myself. Then I can share my experience with you, please try to take\
  \ me which please travelling life is good. At last please win me to some any other\
  \ place in the world"
