Text: "Myles, a graduate stuck in the past, receives an email from an old university\
  \ friend asking if he wants to man a supply station (Scott\u2019s Camp) for explorers\
  \ trekking to and from the South Pole. Accepting the request, Myles travels through\
  \ Argentina and boards a boat to Antarctica. \n  Arriving in the supply station,\
  \ after a horrendous and turbulent boat journey, he arrives at the station to find\
  \ his friend, Andrew, in a mental state akin to madness. \n  Paralleling the great\
  \ adventurer Robert Scott and his ground-breaking expedition to the Antarctic. Andrew\
  \ is found the morning after Myles\u2019 arrival dead in the snow, claiming he was\
  \ only \u201Cheading out for a cigarette\u201D.\n  Myles must now pilot the station\
  \ solo and be stuck in the supply station alone over the season until his homeward\
  \ expedition. Myles battles madness himself, fighting hallucinations, his own self\
  \ doubt and even a polar bear in a perpetual, eerie day that never ends."
