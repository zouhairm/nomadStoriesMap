Text: "The last thing that I expected in this bad city , in this bad period, was this\
  \ opportunity. maybe I was only into this grey cloud that I have built from myself\
  \ and my choices. When I thought that was impossible to win an opportunity like\
  \ this, an erasmus became reality. Where? In Cordoba, Argentina. Finally I see a\
  \ colour and I need a rainbow in my life. that\u2019s because I\u2019m a strange\
  \ person . I need to travel ti know the world but even more to live. I love to know\
  \ other people and their habits and this one is my opportunity to be happy. A chance\
  \ for a little shy italian to grow for a woman Who don\u2019t trust of herself.\
  \ For a clumsty student Who don\u2019t have found place to demostrate her brain.\
  \ Maybe I\u2019m only this clumsty shy student or I could be more. I want to write\
  \ about this trip that have changed my life just now that the plane is not on flight\
  \ yet"
