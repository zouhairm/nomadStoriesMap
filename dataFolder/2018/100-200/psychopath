  \ is the Good word than 'live'.\n\nThis is not an outer journey,  This is an innerjourney.At\
  \ a night i realize that there is a great energy Expelling from the Universe.\n\n\
  This journey is not solo, beacause the universe is also with me. Suddenly at a morning\
  \ i just Made a desicion for go to outer. That is not a plan, that is just a descion.\
  \ I dont know where is that desicion come from.  I just take the bike. Before i\
  \ take the bike. I just kissed the Engine. Because i believe that Engine is the\
  \ heart of a vehicle.  \n\n(This  story is not very long ) \n\nThe story continues\
  \ after 4 hours of riding... \n\n\nMy bike is running me through a glen...  \nA\
  \ big glen..   it is very highest glen.. My bike is going to heat..  making something\
  \ noises from engine... i just scared about that..."
