Text: I arrived at the front gate of Sachsenhausen Concentration Camp,  "arbeit macht
  frei" welcoming us to the grounds where about 30,000 Soviets, gypsies, Jews, and
  gays were brought to die. While not a huge concentration camp, an overwhelming feeling
  of sadness and dread overcame me. Walking where many men, women, and children came
  to work was an experience that opened my eyes to a world that not many people could
  experience. After walking through the camp and back out the gates, "arbeit macht
  frei" in the distance behind me, that feeling of sadness and dread turned to peace.
  Peace knowing that those 30,000 people's lives had a purpose, that their lives and
  memories didn't die in vein. The last thing I expected going into the camp was to
  feel at peace, however, knowing that we won't see that in our lifetime again brought
  me peace.
