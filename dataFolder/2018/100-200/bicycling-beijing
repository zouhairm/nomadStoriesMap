Text: I lived in mainland China for 6 years. I went over to work for a Chinese conglomerate.
  It was an interesting experience as I had never lived there before. The first thing
  I did was get a bicycle so I could travel around. It was a great decision as I saw
  parts of China I could never see int he manner I did. I bicycled like many of the
  citizens (and on an old fashioned Chinese BIG BIKE as they are called). With my
  basket and my bell I want to all parts of Beijing and beyond. When I moved to Shenzhen
  and then Shanghai I took the bicycle with me. I met many great people. Had many
  adventures. Tried things most expats or tourists wouldn't do (like having a haircut
  int he street or eating at "select" food stalls and staying in purely Chinese hotels
  in the back roads. I wrote many stories of my trip. Even had one published in a
  Chinese magazine. It was a great experience that I am putting into a book format.
