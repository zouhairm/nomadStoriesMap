Text: The last thing I expected was to be given the opportunity to travel to Europe
  and on short notice! My boyfriend at the time was going to visit his mom I'm Finland
  and surprised me by getting me a ticket as well! I will never forget that trip because
  it made me feel like I was home. We had traveled there at christmas and visited
  all through Kirkilla and downtown and even took a cruise down to Estonia where my
  mother was born. My mother and I have never really spoke about her life there so
  through my eyes I saw what it was like for her. I learned about the history of the
  Russians and Finish people and also that Estonia was the party town for the Finnish
  and Russian alike!
