Text: "I would like to write about any specific region in Argentina and get the local\
  \ people to tell me their life stories. Giving it fictional elements of story writing,\
  \ I would like to weave these stories into a novel. Argentina has beautiful people\
  \ and a rich culture, writing a narrative or a travelogue would be a dream come\
  \ true. I would also like to document each day there, and keep a separate journal\
  \ for that.\n\nExploring new regions, and gaining from such global experiences is\
  \ important and I would want to make the most of it. Writing about the narratives\
  \ of the indigenous people would also help people learn about Argentina globally.\
  \ Weaving narratives together would require effort, but I think I would really enjoy\
  \ doing that. \n\nDescribing the landscape would also be pivotal to the story, and\
  \ I would like to incorporate that into the tales I see."
