Text: "Brazil wasn't just another place for visiting the beach and partying from dusk\
  \ till dawn It has amazing food coffee and the freshest fruit drinks and the best\
  \ weather imaginable \n\nTraveling around Brazil can be done just as much on a shoestring\
  \ than anything else beaches coastlines and landscapes are aw of travellers and\
  \ locals itself and street and beach festivals everyone just blends in no matter\
  \ where your from has that welcoming atmosphere that makes the travel there so appealing\
  \ that the country so big in size you want to discover even more of it in the future\
  \ when deciding when to come back \n\nFrom my travel from Porto Alegre to Natal\
  \ this was one of those adventures where it had local culture great cuisine street\
  \ festivals where Carnival is Brazil's most famous event to the world just looking\
  \ like St Patrick's day is to Ireland it has everything that made my trip very memorable\
  \ it has my hidden oasis that I'd been looking for"
