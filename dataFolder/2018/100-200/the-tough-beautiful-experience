Text: When I was in Romania in the beginning of 2017 I was inspired by some travel
  bloggers on Facebook who travel in untraditional ways like hitch hiking or something
  like that My friend and I decided at this time to experience that thing however
  we could travel normally with a train or even domestic flight the trip was from
  Timisoara to Brasov about 500km distance we went out and standed on the side of
  the road and were holding written sign of "Brasov" at the beginning of the trip
  we were so excited and energized by the love of adventure and trying new things.
  When we figure out how much hard it was and it was not easy to make cars stop and
  pick us up and we took about 8 rides to get to Brasov in 8-10 hours I was really
  exhausting trip although the normal trip for that distance takes about 4 hours for
  prepared trip the useful aspect of the trip is that I knew new people new Cultures
  and different languages and stories we slept in cars ate from restaurants on the
  side of the road it was tough experience but I really enjoyed it
