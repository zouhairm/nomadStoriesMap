Text: "Travelling leaves you speechless and then turns you into a storyteller. The\
  \ only place where you can meet yourself is when you are travelling. Travelling\
  \ is the nearest synonym of learning. The more you travel, the more you learn. Life\
  \ is a journey, and I'm travelling without ticket. Travelling pushed me to the edge.\
  \ I connected with myself. \n I visited to one of the oldest city in India. \"Hampi\"\
  \ - it's mystic of yore. It has everything a traveler needs to know about a city,\
  \ and when you travel you don't explore the city, you explore yourself. I experience\
  \ the richest architecture, and the oldest rock formation of the boulders of India.\
  \ Rocks, which ages 4 million years old, are there when the earth came into existence.\n\
  Hampi has crafts and monuments from history. Hampi runs along with the Tungabhadra\
  \ river. Every spot and near to the rivers. Hampi has stones and rocks and every\
  \ rocks tells a story. There are million of rocks and million of stories in hampi.\n\
  \nIt has rich culture, and the king who ruled hampi gave a great tale to tell to\
  \ the world.\n\nHampi is really the mysterious world in itself."
