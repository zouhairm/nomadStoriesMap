Text: '"Last night nature blew my mind in the most unexpected way. 00:30 am, the water
  is crystal clear, calm and still. Silence. Moonlight is all there is but the sand
  is so white that it''s more than enough. As I''m getting into the water, my body
  starts.. blinking. More and more as I''m getting deeper. Bright blue sparks all
  over my (naked :O) body, even without moving but becoming much more intense as I
  shake and jiggle my hands. I started kicking leaving trails of blue sparkling water
  around me. Insanely amazed, it''s surreal. Bioluminescent plankton, you made my
  night, my week and a heck of an experience!"'
