Text: So i would want to start with explaining to you the theme is that i would want
  to travel to an island and I would like to observe the local people and ask them
  about their daily lives what challenges to they face and what kinds of problems
  do they encounter in their day to day lives and i would compare it with the last
  lives of people living in cities and make them realise that they have been living
  in a very complex environment and life could be very easy and lesser things to worry
  for and that there isnt that much competition like we create. Comparing the fast
  paced lives of cities with simple remote living realities i would want to reflect
  the illusions of what we deem a happy life would be reflected in the book and hence
  would be called Living in a mirage
