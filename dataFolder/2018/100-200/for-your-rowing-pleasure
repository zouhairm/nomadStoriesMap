Text: 'Rafting in the Znskar River, Leh, Ladakh, India


  The river runs wild. The river runs for miles. I stand at the edge. Contemplating.
  The life jackets are piled up. The helmets dumped. They pick their safety gear up
  as I stare at the river.


  A patch of calm blue interspersed with foamy white, surrounded by green everywhere.
  I pick up my paddle and row. Row, says the guide. Row forward.


  Feet locked. Fear felt. Heart on the sleeve. Craving for adventure. Invitation to
  the waves to come hit me. Hit me hard and break my bones. I will worry about drowning
  tomorrow. I will calculate the depth of the water some other day. For now, Come
  waves come.


  And then they come. From everywhere. A splash here. Shrieks everywhere. Water gushing
  in. Adrenaline gushing out.


  The river is mine. I am rowing. With the currents. Against the currents. Amidst.
  Within. Inside. Around.'
