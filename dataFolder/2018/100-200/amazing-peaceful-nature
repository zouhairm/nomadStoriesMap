Text: "Hello everyone my name is Sandeep Rawat     I love to travel and always excited\
  \ to go new places because I love mother nature  and I love photography I never\
  \ thought about story writing because I'm not good in that \U0001F600 . India's\
  \ diversity knows no bounds. Just as every part of the country has something unique\
  \ to off Its own intrinsic style. I'm not travel too much yet . I belongs to uttrakhand\
  \ state of India. Uttrakhand to has something special to call it's own and share\
  \ with the world. This Himalaya state has an abundance of natural beauty and is\
  \ the birthplace of many rivers . Including the holiest of them all \"The ganga\"\
  \ . Indian lore has its root steeped in the soil and stories of the region. It is\
  \ believed that the god made this land their home owningvl to its magnificent beauty.\
  \ Which is why this place also known as \"dev bhoomi\"...... uttrakhand loveliness\
  \ is not limited to its aesthetic blessing . The people and their lifestyle add\
  \ a whole new dimension of charm to this religion"
