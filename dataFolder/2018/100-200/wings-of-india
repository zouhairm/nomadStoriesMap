Text: Well i loved travelling so much.  I was working with mnc company as electrical
  engineer. But after a years i realize that its not my job.  My job is actually travelling.  So
  i decided to travel the india. First i visited all the places in gujarat.  It was
  thunderest experience. The people are so kind. And the food in gujarat is so yummy.
  I dont have word to describe.  You cant just feel when you visit. I have seen the
  white desert.  Some of large Rivers of india. Some crowded cities.  Its just amazing
  to go and talk with new strange peoples. I love it. that's all !
