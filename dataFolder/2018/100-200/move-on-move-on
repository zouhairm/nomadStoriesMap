Text: "I realized that my talents and capabilities get more blind day by day when\
  \ i was working in private sector as white collar. Then, i told myself that this\
  \ is my life and i create it with my decisions so i can go out from this stucking\
  \ system. \n\nI am interested in art: drawing, painting, ukulele, guitar, tombak,\
  \ and melodica. So i told myself that i can go deeply into my passion, and meet\
  \ with other people like me. So i searched and decided to go to Arambol firstly\
  \ to meet with artists. Another reason triggering me and get excited to travel to\
  \ India was ancient Indian philosophy that we are all part of the whole, living\
  \ energy, Chi."
