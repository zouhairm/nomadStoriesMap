Text: Am a girl from a family of 10, second in the family. As I grew up, my parents
  never had much money to educate me to the highest level, but I worked farm sell
  products and managed to sponsor myself to the teacher iam today. Through my secondary
  school, I happened to stay with a family who were never mine. They showed me love
  because I too was a hard working girl. At the end of my secondary school in that
  house, they promised to sponsor me to a teacher  training school, but they never
  did. I was tensed, surprised, so I never expected this. This was the last thing
  I expected from them.
