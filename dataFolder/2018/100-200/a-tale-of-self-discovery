Text: I took a trip with my wife to Thailand in April 2017. It was one of the most
  amazing times of my life. Not only did I get to share my love of travel with my
  soulmate but I got to experience a new culture in all of its glory. From the busy
  street markets to the bustling traffic passing right in front of us to the sweltering
  heat, our experience was sure to become one that would remember for the rest of
  our lives. This trip pushed me to realize that I am not meant to be chained to my
  desk but rather experience the beauty that our world offers and sharing it with
  others.
