Text: 'Kolkata is a city of joy, this city is one of the cheapest city in India that''s
  what this place attracts most people , people comes from all over the world in this
  city to live in peace, all over the world like african,Nigerians,etc they live here
  in peace because of poverty in theirs city.

  Middle-class people from Delhi, Bangalore comes here for business and live a luxury
  life.

  In 70s Kolkata was the capital of India, back then when British was ruling India
  they made this capital city for trading.

  And Kolkata was the first advance city in India made by British, people still now
  a days calls this city a second London.

  Actually it is, if you ever come to Kolkata street you''ll see old British structure,road,bridge,and
  building''s.

  Now the city is not that much well maintained, but it''s developing.

  Every People here (bengali''s) lives a simple life, they like to live together with
  there families.

  Some, don''t even want to go to other countries or city''s because of there families.


  Here people are very casual they work,have fun and go home.

  That''s why Kolkata has no millionaire.


  Bengali''s are lazy.'
