Text: Traveling with friends, we found ourselves in the new beautiful city of Singapore.
  A floating metropolis adorned with statues of water lions and gorgeous architecture,
  this sovereign city boasts such a diverse visage of beauty. One island exclusively
  sits a massive three-tower (yes, you heard correctly) hotel with a boat as they
  call it balancing across all three. Adjacent to the paradiso we were lucky enough
  to spend a night in stood the Singapore Flyer, the world's largest Ferris Wheel
  that can only be accessed by traversing through a portion of city with such a blend
  of nature melded into building, Tarzan and Spider Man would end up dueling to swing
  through the layout. We went up in the Flyer to find it overlooking almost the entire
  city, gazing upon the wonder to behold. Unable to see everything, we set our sights
  on a better view and journeyed to the tram which took us over the highest point
  in Singapore. There, we were finally able to look over the booming metropolis. As
  the sun set over the hotel, we watched it hide behind our temporary resident, satisfied
  with our adventure.
