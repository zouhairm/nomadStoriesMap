Text: 'When I was in my 11th standard me and my brother forced my father to take leave
  from his work and we should travel north or hill stations for the first time.

  we made some great plans, but as you say the more plans you make the more they are
  hard to execute.we went on shopping with some boots and winter clothes for the weather.

  as we were in a hurry we were doing the bulk shopping.after the shopping was done
  the day had come, we came to the airport at Jaipur and we came to know that the
  flight was delayed by 4 hours due to fog.

  we lose the hope but then my brother said we should not leave it and must travel
  through a cab .after so much stress we finally rented a car and me and my father
  drove it for 12 freaking and chilling hour on an unknown way.

  At the dawn, we reach our destination and when the sun rises and we saw the view
  from the peak our face smile was wide and we all guys were truly happy.'
