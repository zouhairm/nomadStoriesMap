Text: Trying to unwind from life's busy schedule, I make a solo trip to Paris - to
  find the satori that Jack Kerouac talks about. I wander around Paris like Baudelaire's
  flaneur, trying to find inspiration in the streets of Paris. I believe in serendipity
  and chance encounters that can change life. I meet a local opera singer and her
  mother who seem to be enjoying the Parisian summer just like me. But its her 90
  year old mother, a recent widow, whose attitude to life really gives me the satori
  I have been looking for. The key is to let go of all the tourist traps and really
  focus on what the place is telling you - the textures, the smells, the tastes, the
  sights and most importantly how you feel in the city. People make a city and not
  the other way around.
