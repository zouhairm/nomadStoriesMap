Text: "Hey all travelyaars,As Valentine\u2019s Day approaches, many of us humans go\
  \ berserk in the name of love. Pink and red seem to take on precedence in terms\
  \ of colours, and hearts and ribbons dominate our urban landscapes like jazzy malls\
  \ and roadside vendors! We humans have given love a distinct definition, binding\
  \ it into time and space. Interestingly, our wild brethren seldom show that love-obsession,\
  \ maybe only to some extent in terms of mating seasons and destinations. And this\
  \ does not mean that they do not really have their heart-warming (or even heart-wrenching)\
  \ love stories! From elaborate mating rituals to absolute rejection, from a commitment\
  \ to dejection, they too face the good and bad in love. So, this Valentine\u2019\
  s Day let\u2019s spare some thought and peep into the love stories of our beloved\
  \ wild denizens."
