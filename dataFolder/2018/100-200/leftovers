Text: "I\u2019ve done a big travel trough Asia with some friends last year and we\
  \ met someone called Lura, an old woman from Vietnam that told us his son was stolen\
  \ from her when she was young because the viet government was stolen babies to raise\
  \ them into soldiers. We didn\u2019t believe it so we moved on. In December of the\
  \ same year we decided to go to Australia. And we go out to have some drinks. We\
  \ met a group of guys from China, students in their 21, and one of them, Jun In,\
  \ told us that he didn\u2019t know their parents - we were drunk and singing Queen,\
  \ so... Jun was from vietnam and really similar to the woman we met. I told him\
  \ the Lura story and he was so excited that he bought a ticket to go to Vietnam\
  \ in the following day (drunk). He found out that Lura was dead already but (i dunno\
  \ how) collected DNA samples from her to know if she was her mother. And... she\
  \ was."
