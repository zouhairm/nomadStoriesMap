Text: "Long awaited dream to travel to Kanyakumari, southern tip of India. Sangam\
  \ a place where three oceans meet arabian sea, indian ocean bay of bengal meet.\
  \ A magnificient view just get surrounding with ocean all the sides. Taking a motor\
  \ boat ride to vivekanada memorial hall island is amazing.\n In this journey met\
  \ many people, one is the auto driver, who dropped me to the railway station. the\
  \ conversation just started to know his profession. i was amazed to listen that\
  \ he is an engineer,but choose to drive auto because of his passion to drive. 10\
  \ years of his journey, made him to own a travel business, affiliate marketer and\
  \ a millionaire in that region. but the simplicity of the person is to still ride\
  \ an auto and dropping the people to the right locations!\ni salute him for the\
  \ passion he has which inspires anyone to become the best by being themselves!"
