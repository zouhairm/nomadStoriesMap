Text: "I quit my job because I wanted adventure. I pushed myself to the edge of the\
  \ world literally and chose middle earth. All by myself a girl from New Hampshire\
  \ in the United States set off. I didn\u2019t have a plan or friends but I intended\
  \ to make both along the way. \nI started in the north island of New Zealand which\
  \ to me in iconic New Zealand. I went on a Maori college tour and did a little hiking.\
  \ Traveling not cheaply by bus . I turned down everyone\u2019s advice to buy a car.\
  \ I eventually got to the South Island with my snowboard, which was a burden since\
  \ the moment I left the states because I was too big. But when I got to tribal cone\
  \ that first day. I was in love."
