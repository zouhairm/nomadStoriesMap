Text: "When you\u2019re a typical student, you have just 2 behaviors: go out secretly\
  \ from mom and make exams for a grant. But if you understand that your future choice,\
  \ your speciality isn't right - you can leave a home country for a work in Viet\
  \ Nam. I can explain.\n\nThree years ago I had a depression and I thought about\
  \ a new country for life. I started to prepare documents for Au Pair in Germany.\
  \ At the same time, my sister offered me a job in Viet Nam. Of course, I said yes.\
  \ Work as a promoter of Russian vodka instead caring about foreign children - why\
  \ not. I will instantly change this. I left my university course in favor of country\
  \ of motorbikes, moist architecture and soy milk.\n\n So I worked, made observing\
  \ new country and culture, traded for fruits with street sellers, had breakfast\
  \ as soup, looked at naked electric installation and was really happy. You know\
  \ a feeling when you\u2019re happier after a trip than at the time?\nMy purpose\
  \ is being a maximal international person."
