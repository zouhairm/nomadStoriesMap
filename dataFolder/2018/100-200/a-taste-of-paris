Text: You can taste the history of France within minutes of entering Paris. In Montparnasse,
  or on the Seine, the air hits you like the breath of a people. The revolutions,
  the salons, even De Gaulle. Even without a knowledge of the place it's impossible
  to miss the signs that hang everywhere, not bluntly or even in words, but in something
  about the faces that line the streets. The friendly owner of a restaurant who is
  visibly sleepy as he takes your order; but still takes the time to show you how
  to eat snails like a Parisian. Or the young woman on the steps of the Sacre-Coeur
  who pours you a glass of wine from her only bottle. It is a scarred city without
  a doubt, one that shows its wounds everyday with the heavily armed National Guard
  patrolling the street, a thread of violence sewn in a rich tapestry of culture.
  Paris however, and France as well, have a far greater tolerance for and history
  of suffering than most developed nations, and every time a man, woman, or child
  smiles and hums along to 'Je T'aime," so too does France.
