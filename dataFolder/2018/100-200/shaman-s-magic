Text: This story begins at a lunar eclipse, Asha, our Shaman, unfolds true wings in
  the moonlight. A gift she had, many lifetimes ago, given up to become a part of
  the human world. She forgot who she was and where she came from. Humans noticed
  her luminous differences and were afraid. Lifetime after lifetime she was persecuted
  by the people she hoped to save. In a sea of plastic shamans one day she discovered
  a mirror, one like herself, grown from humanity and not the heavens. The seed she
  had planted returned to her and she remembered. Her mission completed Asha was rewarded
  with her wings. She remained among the people, with new understanding of her work.Guised
  as a shaman she worked her magic, in secret, in quiet, this time immersed in a generation
  too distracted to notice the changes taking place in themselves and the world around
  them. Laying the groundwork for all of humanity to remember who they are.
