Text: "3 years ago the unthinkable happened. I was sat there preparing to walk down\
  \ the aisle when my fianc\xE9 at the time decided to call it off just 2 weeks before.\
  \ He was never very good at doing things in a timely fashion so this is a prime\
  \ example of leaving things to the last minute. Obviously I was in a state of shock,\
  \ a 6 year relationship and a year planning a wedding over in one night. Needless\
  \ to say my honeymoon was already booked so I had a choice wallow in self pity or\
  \ get on a plane to Mexico. So I did got on the plane and it was the greatest experience\
  \ of my life. I got to meet the locals, drink tequila on tap and dance the night\
  \ away in the best club I\u2019ve ever been to (Coco Bongos). Sun, sea and sand\
  \ there\u2019s nothing better than that to get over a broken heart."
