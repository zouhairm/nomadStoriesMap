Text: 'I start full time travel to many countries in Asia and Europe to get to know
  more historical and cultural to understand the way local people live and thinking.
  Every door it''s open I will visit, every place has story and history, every food
  has culture. I love to learn more and share with other people. On my trip I met
  many people some are backpacker some are local and I call friends connect to exchange
  information and experience, until now I still keep in touch with them and looking
  forward if I can visit them again. Personally I love to write and share with people.


  Iast 2 year I has been to Myanmar, Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, Hongkong, china,
  Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Philipine, Germany, France, Czech Republic, Austria, Italy,
  Belgium. This year I plan to continue  travel in Maxico, Colombia, Peru, Brazil,
  Argentina for 6 months and travel more to America, Canada and Alaska.
