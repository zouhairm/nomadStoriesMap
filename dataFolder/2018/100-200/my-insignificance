Text: "It was my last day in the US. Having spent 3 months in Cleveland, I drove to\
  \ New York a day before my departure from JFK to India. With the entire day to myself,\
  \ I ventured out to explore the Big Apple - the World Trade Centre Memorial, the\
  \ Times Square, the Grand Central Terminal, the Central Park - switching between\
  \ the subway and the taxiscabs of the city. \n\nWhile I was wondering the streets\
  \ of the sprawling city, an unsettling thought came to my mind about my place in\
  \ the city - among the swarm of people, the huge skyscrapers, the plying yellow\
  \ medallion taxis. Figuratively, I could transcend the limits of the city and imagine\
  \ myself as a tiny drop in an ocean."
