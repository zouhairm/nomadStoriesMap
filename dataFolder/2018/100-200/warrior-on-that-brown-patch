Text: 'Warrior on the brown patch discusses the issues of immigrant families from
  India travelling to various countries.

  The name is derived from the elements of the main character who is an immigrant
  from India and now playing cricket (and a legend) for Australia. The main character
  had moved to Australia as an 8 year old when his father found a job in Australian
  mining industry. In a country which is so different to his birth place and the only
  2 features in common are, the love for cricket and the national days.


  The ''brown patch'' refers to the cricket pitch and the colour of the skin from
  Indian subcontinent. The ''Warrior'' refers to the struggle to achieve excellence.


  The story is not just focusing on travel but the entire journey of an immigrant
  and their struggles. As part of research for my book, I have travelled to Sri Lanka,
  Cambodia, Singapore, Thailand, Papua New Guinea, South Africa and Madagascar.

  This is to understand ancient and modern immigration of Indians.


  My next focus is to travel to Turkey, Argentina, United States (especially Silicone
  Valley) and of course the United Kingdom.'
