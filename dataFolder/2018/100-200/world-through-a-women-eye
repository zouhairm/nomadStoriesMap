Text: "The beautiful Bali is different experience as I travelled there with my amazing\
  \ 7 friends for life , we chose the cheapest way to travel the 5 days stayed there\
  \ and for that we had to connect with the locals. \nThe first thing I was taught\
  \ - swastiasthu means welcome Namaste \U0001F64F. With the help of the locals hired\
  \ scooty and in just 2 days we covered Ubud and uluwata. \nBeautiful temple \nRice\
  \ terrace \nForest \nSpectacular view of sunset from The rock bar in  Uluwata \n\
  \nEveryday a new experience, one day had to struggle with monkeys in Uluwata . \
  \ They took my stole . Funny incidents ."
