Text: After completion of my graduation like all ,i have wasted 3 years ,I worked
  but not up on my wish and suddenly one day i got chance to go Goa with one of my
  relative. A place where Beaches with golden color sands welcome you to enjoy the
  environment,and the sunsets in the beach makes us believe we are in the peaceful
  place in the world.It is the best feeling in my life that make my life change.Before
  i have thought of travelling but I postpone always.But exploring and travelling
  gives you an energy and helps you to know about yourself .That 3 days of my trip
  changed my life ,It convey me a message not to stop at any point whatever happen
  keep going there will be something to learn or experience.Then i tried and got up
  the job and shifted my location and visiting places by earning.
