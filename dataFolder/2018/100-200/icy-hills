Text: 'A middle class boy dreaming about the treks,trips and having his own travel
  story.

  Hi, Myself Yashraj basantia,I am from INDIA. A country with different varieties
  of peoples ,languages and religious too.I was just trying harder and harder in my
  photography,travelling but i never get any chance.I belongs to a middle class family
  where parents told their children to study and get a job...Nothing to do extra above
  this.But i am not of that type,I donot want that type of life.Life is kinda of one
  way,you can''t turn back.And its a single life to enjoy and get some internships
  and scholars of travelling the god made living planet.I cant write more because
  i dont have more money to pay the cyber cafe.


  Thank you sir

  Yashraj basantia'
