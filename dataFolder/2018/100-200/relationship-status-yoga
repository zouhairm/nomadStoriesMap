Text: "Often referred as the \u2018Abode of Gods\u2019, Rishikesh is among the most\
  \ ancient pilgrimage centers of India. The history of this town is rich with numerous\
  \ legends and mythical stories. The name of the town itself is after one of the\
  \ names of Hindu God, Lord Vishnu. According to legends, the great Hindu saint Raibhya\
  \ Rishi performed prolonged penance on the banks of Holy River Ganges at this place.\
  \ As a reward to saint\u2019s strong penance, Lord Vishnu appeared to him in his\
  \ incarnation of Lord Hrishikesh. Thus the place got its name. \n\nSince ancient\
  \ times, Rishikesh has been an important pilgrimage spot for the saints and Hindu\
  \ devotees. However, it is during the initial medieval period in India that the\
  \ place started to gain more popularity. During 8th century Adi Shankaracharya,\
  \ one of most renowned and revered sages from India, built several temples and ashrams\
  \ in the region."
