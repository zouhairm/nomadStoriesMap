Text: "There could be many number of reasons. For some it\u2019s a way to satiate\
  \ their curiosity about the world, to explore and experience new cultures. For others\
  \ it\u2019s about relaxing, rejuvenating or breaking out of the \u2018work bubble\u2019\
  . Adrenaline junkies might be in pursuit of their next big thrill while foodies\
  \ may be searching for novel flavors to tantalize their taste buds.\nEveryone has\
  \ their own impetus to travel. However, I believe that one of the most powerful,\
  \ underlying forces is the desire to connect with humanity. By meeting new people\
  \ around the world we are better able to understand our differences, to appreciate\
  \ and accept them. But we also begin to realize just how small the world is, and\
  \ how we all want the same basic things out of life\u2014love, health and happiness."
