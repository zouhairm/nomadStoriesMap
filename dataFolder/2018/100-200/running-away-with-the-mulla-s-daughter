Text: "The story is set around in the late 1990s.\n\nIn the scholarship money recieved\
  \ by the government for university, Hadi, a Jewish boy decides to go on a photography\
  \ trip instead . And where he goes ? Iran.\nThe idea was to photograph life of the\
  \ Jews in Iran and reroute back home to Tel Aviv. \nBut what happens next changes\
  \ the entire scenario. \nOne of the photographs clicked, when  zoomed in , has disturbing\
  \ content in the background  . A girl is handcuffed to a policeman and is seen helpless\
  \ being dragged. Hadi decides to find out more. And when he does , the girl turns\
  \ out to be a local chieftain's daughter who is being accused of adultery and is\
  \ sentenced to death by stoning.\nHadi snooping around with the camera has got himself\
  \ a little attention which again has created a slight problem.\nHadi's got local\
  \ authority alarmed about a \"young Jew walking around with a camera\".\nHow Hadi\
  \ escapes along with Noor and exposes the social evils that happen in the name of\
  \ religion is the plot."
