Text: It was my 30th birthday and we were celebrating in Puerto Rico. I had said I
  wanted to zipline, something my sisters and I had never done before. We went through
  the training, got our equipment, and hiked through some of the rain forest to the
  first platform. We watched as three people in front of us zipped off the platform.
  It was our turn. Standing at the edge, not yet hooked to the line, I was no longer
  certain I really wanted to do this. One of us had to go first. Suddenly I was the
  lone sister standing in front to go. I decided this was it. A beautiful rainforest
  down below, the one thing I really wanted to do on my birthday. I hooked in and
  took off flying. Halfway through the first line I reminded myself to open my eyes
  and look down. I landed in time to see my sister getting ready to go. We did it!
