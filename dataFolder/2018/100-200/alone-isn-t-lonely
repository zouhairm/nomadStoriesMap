Text: "Have you ever traveled alone? It takes some character when you start. There\
  \ are always questions of safety, questions if you can do it and why are you even\
  \ doing it. When you travel alone you can really reflect on who you are and what\
  \ the purpose of all of it. And at the end it becomes all so clear! You find so\
  \ much power within yourself. And along the way you meet great people and friends.\
  \ It\u2019s all worth it in a long run. You get to know yourself, what you are made\
  \ of and what keeps you going. Sometimes there are disappointments and some times\
  \ there unbelievable wins. And it\u2019s all in your hands and heart to start the\
  \ journey and face all the challenges. The main point - it\u2019s all worth it!"
