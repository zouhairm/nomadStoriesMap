  \ join knowledge in my opnion. This year I have visited some countries e discovered\
  \ we humans are so different at the same time we are equals. I have met amazing\
  \ people and make true friendships around the world and I realized that the language\
  \ is a kind of wall between us and other culture and we ourselves need to broken\
  \ this wall to be happier. One picture can tell us more than 1000 words. If u wanna\
  \ know more about me, follow my story in the instagram: ricardo.amarilla2202"
