Text: When I was 14 I need to do an internship in Ireland. I was very sick. With 1,63m.
  I just weight 32kg. I wasn't even able to carry three dishes. BUT when I was sitting
  on the dock of a bay, crying because of helplessness I remembered how happy I was
  when I was little. I decide to turn back in little Miss Sunshine. It was a hard
  and stony way with many setbacks. Often I thought I will never recover for hundred
  procent. I was very afraid of it! But finally I did it. Now I am a personal trainer,
  nutritionist and mainly motivation and life coach. I help people who wanna get out
  of the black disgusting hole. AND I am proud to be one of the less women who recover
  for 100%. I am proud that I learned again how delicious food can be... how great
  life is ... I am thankful for every day and I wanna be a idol for all the sick people
  outside. Let's change the world! Let's turn it in a happy strong healthy world.
