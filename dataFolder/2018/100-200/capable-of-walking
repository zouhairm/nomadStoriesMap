Text: 'It was blood. It was blood all over my head and a sharp, stabbing pain. Then
  I started to realize: I was severely wounded, but I was alive. The mountains are
  ruthless travel companions, they have no mercy, that is what my father used to say.
  Right away I took two or three deep breaths and, still quite dizzy, I managed to
  stand up and leave the most dangerous part of the cliff edge. Good news: Capable
  of walking. Bad news: Sprained ankle. More bad news: No mobile phone coverage. I
  had to come down from there to the nearest mountain refuge. It was hard, I passed
  out several times. The first thing that came to my mind while getting on the rescue
  helicopter: I need to come back as soon as possible. It was amazing and I am still
  capable of walking.'
