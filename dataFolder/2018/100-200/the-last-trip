Text: 'It''s about a very depressive  girl with a Borderline Personality Disorder  that
  decides to end her life after a lot of toxic relationships with men  trying everything
  to finally be happy, changes in city, changes of friends, changes of drugs... She
  wants a last trip a last chance. However what she didn''t expected was that was
  she is going to find in her last trip isn''t the end, but her true origin..



  The story starts with her crying in a bathroom, cutting herself. Not knowing what
  to do to end this feeling of nothing...


  When she had an opportunity to win money for being an objective for clinical research,
  she decided to use that for a last trip where she wants finally to be free. Not
  expecting adventures are following and learning about who she really is (this part
  need the trip to be inspired)'
