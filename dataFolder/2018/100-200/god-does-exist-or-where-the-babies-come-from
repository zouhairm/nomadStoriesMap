Text: 'In 1991 I got into an unpleasant story. There were times of the USSR. Parents
  told us that they find children in cabbage. But one day I found the Kama Sutra and
  realized that adults lie about where the children come from. At the same time, I
  was preparing to become a pioneer. And the law of the pioneers says: Pioneer - an
  honest and loyal friend, always protecting the truth! I decided to tell the whole
  school the truth. I wrote a great ad on "Where do the kids come from" and posted
  it in the lobby. There was a terrible scandal. They told me that they would not
  take me as a pioneer. In the USSR, this meant the end of everything: respect, development,
  career. And I made a wish for God. I asked him to perform a miracle. Do it so that
  parents do not know about my shame, and that my future is spared from the consequences
  of this act. As a result, in the same year the USSR collapsed.

  About this story created a movie. If interested, it''s on the web address:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak7pl8CcWwA&feature=youtu.be'
