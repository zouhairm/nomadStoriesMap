Text: "It was late last night. We took a bus from Uyuni to Oruro. Local people recommended\
  \ us to only take the train but because it was fully booked we couldn\u2019t catch\
  \ it. So we jumped on the bus, the ride had started and we felt asleep before we\
  \ couldn\u2019t even tell where we where. All of te sudden I woke up with a tremendous\
  \ sound that scared the life out of me. We were up side down one on top of the other.\
  \ Was so hard to tell what was going on, a guy next to me said \u201Clet\u2019s\
  \ all go out using the Windows\u201D and that\u2019s when o saw it. We were just\
  \ in the middle of nowhere. The hugest salt desert in the entire world. The floor\
  \ of the bus was facing the sky. \nAt this point to wait for help is pointless.\
  \ And that\u2019s when the locals with no complain started to push the bus up and\
  \ they got it working again. To see that strength, that conviction that team work\
  \ made me realise how different things are down here in a country like Bolivia.\
  \ There are people with no legs that still walk."
