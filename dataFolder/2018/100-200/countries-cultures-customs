Text: China  which have very deep roots of ancient past and which is emerged as one
  of the Super power. Chinese have passion towards fantasy. They are Day Dreamers
  with dream catcher. I entered China as a wanderer. Who is complete travel passionate.
  The things thought in an around chain, seeing became observing after 2months of
  my journey. The productivity, production,  global imports and exports of the country
  turned me to have a look in an entrepreneur view. There by I made a decision to
  take a new step for making my trips around the world as an businesses men. That
  pushed me to an edge from where I can have a view of needs and deeds of people.
  Lots of things have been changed but change doesn't made me feel regret at any point.
  So I am happy in my journey.
