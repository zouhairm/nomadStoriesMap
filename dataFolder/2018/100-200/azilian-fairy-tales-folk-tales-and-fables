Text: "my travel story is about the brazil music since the The music encompasses various\
  \ regional music styles influenced by African, European and Amerindian forms. After\
  \ 500 years of history, Brazilian music developed some unique and original styles\
  \ such as samba, bossa nova, MPB, sertanejo, pagode, tropicalia, choro, maracatu,\
  \ embolada (coco de repente), frevo, forr\xF3, ax\xE9, brega, and Brazilian versions\
  \ of foreign musical genres, such as Brazilian rock and rap.\n\nSamba has become\
  \ the best known form of Brazilian music worldwide, especially because of the country's\
  \ carnival, although bossa nova, which had Ant\xF4nio Carlos Jobim as one of its\
  \ most acclaimed composers and performers, have received much attention abroad since\
  \ the 1950s, when the song \"Desafinado\", interpreted by Jo\xE3o Gilberto, was\
  \ first released.\n\nThe first four winner\u2019s of the Shell Brazilian Music prize\
  \ have each left a very important legacy on Brazilian music and are among the most\
  \ important representatives of Brazilian popular music: Pixinguinha (choro), Ant\xF4\
  nio Carlos Jobim (bossa nova), Dorival Caymmi (samba and samba-can\xE7\xE3o) and\
  \ Luiz Gonzaga (bai\xE3o and forr\xF3)."
