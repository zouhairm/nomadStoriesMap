Text: "Portugal, this country with 8 letters mean so much to me! It all start here,\
  \ my birth, my begging and probably is going to be my end. \nI could be here talking\
  \ about the trips I made and all the places I visit but everything brings me back\
  \ to my hometown, Oporto. This magic city, that can bring life to anyone that pass\
  \ here, is something that is impossible to explain! You can feel the Portuguese\
  \ soul and everything we suffer just to conquer everything we had. I learn that\
  \ no matter what country I visit, or how much I travel I will always come back home!!\
  \ Even visiting others cities in Portugal you always feel like you belong there,\
  \ the people are the secret for this happiness!! The people mean so much to me that\
  \ even if I had all the money in world I would always be back to this tiny country.\
  \ That's the feeling I have!! So please even if I don't win come and visit!!! I'm\
  \ sure you are not going to regret and anytime you want to come back you are more\
  \ than welcome! \nYou can't skip Portugal \U0001F1F5\U0001F1F9\nThank you! \U0001F499"
