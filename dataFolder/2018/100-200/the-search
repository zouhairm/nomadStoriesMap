Text: 'I love traveling and writing. I took the journalism course but unfortunately
  I have not had the financial availability to travel.

  Your proposal seems to me to be interesting because it brings together two passions
  of mine - writing and traveling.

  One country that attracts me a lot is Ireland. I''m not sure why ... maybe because
  of its nature and culture.

  I would like to visit her, and "paint a picture" about Ireland that I will meet.

  The Irish people are known for their friendliness and hospitality.

  It is a dream .... I am a dreamer and I believe that only the dreamers are reserved
  the greatest joys.'
