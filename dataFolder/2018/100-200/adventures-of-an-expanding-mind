Text: Going to a country that holds my roots deep within the earth and having the
  opportunity to see where my lineage began. It was an intense intimate experience;
  the people are humble and greet with upmost respect to whoever they embrace. Yet,
  there were times when I would withdraw within due to the fact that even though I
  was a Liberian by blood, I felt alienated for being born in a completely different
  continent. Over time I began to meet a variety of people from diverse backgrounnds
  that struggled through similar feats. It was interesting to know that I was not
  the only one to feel this way. As the years went by I continued to mingele with
  the locals learning therir way of speech I forgot to mention the languge spoke in
  colloquial.... learn the culture, traditions and so on. I admit it was difficult
  to place  myself in an unfamiliar environment for long, but I guess that is the
  best way to learn life, through experience and placing yourself in anothers shoes.......
