Text: At the time, I wasn't even really interested in photography. I brought my camera
  with me to a school trip, in spain, and I was taking pictures as we were moving
  inside the cities we were visiting. I saw that GREAT landscape from Toledo, wich
  is placed in a mountain shape, with a huge convent on the top and such a great light
  over the city, I thought "I have to take that Picture". I stoped the bus, I said
  "Please, let me just take this photo!". I took it. I went back home, in Portugal,
  edited the photo in Lightroom, and asked my friends "What do you think?" and they
  said "You should do that more often! And there is a competition running in this
  company, you should participate". And I did. And I won that competetion. I bought
  more gear and started investing my time in photography. In that time, I became a
  photographer.
