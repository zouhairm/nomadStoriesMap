Text: This was the first trip with my friends. And I was very excited because we were
  going to do some adventure activities. First we started traveling from our place
  katni (MP) to Delhi (India). At Delhi we went to a gurudwara name 'Bangla Sahib'.
  It was the best place I have ever visited. We had lunch there. After that we went
  to bus stop for MacLeod ganj. It took full night to travel to MacLeod ganj. At morning
  we went to hotel then refreshed there. After refreshment we went for our first adventure
  activity 'Paragliding' and the great thing was it was the second highest point in
  the world name 'Bir Billing'. It was very great experience over there then we returned
  to our hotel at evening. Then we went for dinner. Second day, we went for treking
  to 'Triund' we got to much tried there. We stood there someone night it was very
  cold there. Then we return to MacLeod ganj at your hotel. Then 1 day we were roming
  in the city. Then we gone to Manali for 2 days and then we returned back to Delhi.
