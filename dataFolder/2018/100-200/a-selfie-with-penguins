Text: It was a very drizzly and cold day in Sydney. With nothing to do outside in
  the rain I opted to purchase a ticket to Darling Harbor Aquarium. I have already
  visited all attractions of Sydney besides the Aquarium. I have claustrophobia and
  a closed space with sea inhabitants was really scarring me. But i decided to get
  out of my comfort zone. The website said it closed at 6 p.m., it was only 4:45 p.m.
  When I got there, the door was opened, but there was no one inside to take my e-ticket.
  I decided to take a quick around. Well, I must have spent too long to take selfies
  with lovely little penguins, because when I went back inside, the door was locked.
  I was locked up in the foreign country in the closed space with shars. I was chilled
  to the bone. Twenty minutes later, the guard heard shouting. I tried to explain,
  but he was too angry and called the police. I paid a fine of 1300 australian dollars.
  I was really blessed, because I could lose my mind after a whole night in the empty
  Aquarium.
