Text: A breakthrough. The boiling point. Broken was the commitment of being lazy.
  The house was left. The car started. It directed the way to the call. The call was
  the forest, the forest, it sent a message. A path opened up, "follow me" is whispered
  gently to the heart. The mind was void of obstacle. Through normally treacherous
  terrain, a path lit up. Roots from the earth emerged, like rope they supplied a
  way down. Every step on the gentle earth reminded the grace of the mother. Everything
  inn view, the father. Fear did not know how to navigate that day, it seemed to be
  blocked by the will and the gentleness of natures call. The force was far too powerful,
  too effervescent to know how to push against, no sneaky manipulation could surpass
  its glory. The whisper, it knew it's own strength, the whisper, it was. It s soft,
  firm touch inspired a curiosity... it peaked the senses of adventure, arriving a
  sense of courage and desire to answer its call. Fear Folded to this call. What was
  left was a step, followed by another. A cliff presented, and the breath, of a life
  long pipe dream, fullfilled.
