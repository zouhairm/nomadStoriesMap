Text: "I met with a devil\nHe lives with me\nI choose him\nmy heart he broke\nThe\
  \ pain of betrayal so real\nI saw my heart shatter into pieces\nThe hurt of skinned\
  \ knees from childhood felt better\nHolding the millions broken pieces in my hand,\n\
  I tried to glue them together\nBut only so many blows can it withstand\nI decided\
  \ to live on the edge\nI left the years and the devil behind\nAnd took myself to\
  \ a place\nWhere nature didn\u2019t question\nThe leaves just babbled on their own\n\
  The grass just grew\nDidn\u2019t stress about being green or brown\nWhere the moles\
  \ lived above the tree line \nAnd played with the snow\nThe balm that the cliff\
  \ put\nI threw some past pieces into the ditch\nI moved with pride holding my head\
  \ tight\nThe blackness around me clearing\nBut only a bit\nI asked my heart\nWhat\
  \ is it that you are made of\nIt said,\nYour time will come\nDon\u2019t hurry with\
  \ the process\nTill then walk and look around\nThe world of full of stories \nEven\
  \ more imploring\nThey need your voice too\nObserve and write them too"
