Text: "It\u2019s pitch black. Only my friend\u2019s breathing and the cool air around\
  \ us. She stomps her foot on the stairs, and I\u2019m blinded by light. \u2018They\
  \ put a motion detector here but it doesn\u2019t work so well\u2019. She laughs\
  \ at my expression. \n\nOksana lives in an old Soviet building in St. Petersburg.\
  \ \n\nIt\u2019s 5am in the White Nights season. It doesn\u2019t get dark outside.\
  \ Only twilight cloaks the city for a few hours. We have coffee, sweets, the comfortable\
  \ silence of old friends reunited after years apart: I in Dublin, she in the northern\
  \ Venice of Russia. \n\nThe trip started with a 20 hour train journey from the Ukrainian\
  \ border. I saved on the tickets, ending up in a common carriage that was new in\
  \ the time of WWII. After a night on the top bunk in piss-smelling darkness, near\
  \ many snoring bodies, my clothes and face creased, I feel part of the scenery.\n\
  \nThe rest of the day is a blur: underground metro, the deepest in the world, with\
  \ palace-like stations; Nevskiy Prospekt - an avenue of expensive shops. Everything\
  \ has an air of royalty in decay.\n\nI buy a postcard saying \u2018From St. Petersburg\
  \ with Indifference\u2019 - an ironic take on \u2018From Russia with Love\u2019\
  .\n\nThat night, we are ready for what bonds us more than a place of origin: tango.\
  \ As distant as this city might be from Argentina, Russian women are some of the\
  \ most sought-after dancers. Foreign men fly from all over the world for their embrace.\
  \ The women appear childlike, thin, hidden in the partner\u2019s chest, eyes closed.\
  \ They are not afraid to rely on the partner, to trust. I\u2019m not sure that I\
  \ can do this anymore. After years of learning to be independent, strong and equal,\
  \ my dance reflects everything I\u2019ve become. \n\nFinally, I accept a nod from\
  \ an old grey-haired man. He looks like a literature professor and smells surprisingly\
  \ of nothing at all. He invites me to lean on his chest and not do anything. It\
  \ is such a forgotten feeling, like falling asleep in childhood bed, in safety and\
  \ complete protection. I begin to see things differently. This seemingly-passive\
  \ way of dancing is one of the bravest things I\u2019ve done. \n\nMy second partner\
  \ is a woman. In Russia, with its history of long wars and repressions, even now\
  \ there\u2019s still less men than women. \n\nI spend the rest of the night in the\
  \ arms of a boyish girl, who smokes between songs, drinks wine and looks at me with\
  \ a growing fondness. I feel at home for the second time tonight. In a country known\
  \ for homophobia, we are sharing a secret understanding. No words, no judgement."
