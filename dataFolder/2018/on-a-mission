Text: "For over an hour I\u2019ve been sitting on a bus, waiting to cross the Belarusian-Polish\
  \ border. My head is already splitting from an ingrained smell of gasoline and chattering\
  \ babushkas who occupy at least half of the retro-vehicle. This bus would have been\
  \ written off in any other European country but is still alive and kicking in Belarus.\n\
  \u201CAre you carrying cigarettes?\u201D an old lady asks me from across the aisle.\
  \ I shake my head, a little confused. \u201CWould you carry a few packs for me?\u201D\
  \ It takes me a second to realize \u2013 she wants me to smuggle cigarettes.\nJust\
  \ by looking at the bus, you can tell that you are in one of the poorest countries\
  \ in Europe. Salaries are averaging at about $200 per month. If you think that\u2019\
  s bad, wait till you reach retirement age \u2013 that\u2019s where the real struggle\
  \ begins with old people having to balance on a fine line of poverty. Is there a\
  \ silver lining? It\u2019s a clean and safe country with mesmerizing fields, hospitable\
  \ people and a peace-loving dictator (did you really think it was a republic?).\
  \ Groceries are inexpensive, and commodities like cigarettes and alcohol are five\
  \ times cheaper here than in the neighboring Poland. So if you have a couple bad\
  \ habits and are looking to get a taste of the former USSR, chances are you\u2019\
  ll like it here. Jokes aside, it\u2019s definitely a unique country, off the beaten\
  \ path, waiting to be discovered.\nI look into the woman\u2019s eyes and I understand\
  \ it. Being retired and living at the border, she made smuggling her main source\
  \ of income so that she could provide for herself and treat her grandkids to ice-cream.\
  \ She probably does it every weekend and knows the names of all customs officers.\
  \ I\u2019m tempted to say yes, but my mind plays out different scenarios, the worst\
  \ of them \u2013 me being detained by a Polish straznik graniczny. Not an ideal\
  \ situation, given my Russian passport and the hard feelings Poles have for my kind.\
  \ I apologize for not being able to help and immediately feel bad for not smuggling\
  \ cigarettes.\nTwo hours later we finally get through the border to an unwelcoming\
  \ frown of a Polish border control officer. The rusty bus squeals to a stop in a\
  \ town which name is almost impossible to pronounce due to the number of consonants.\
  \ The loud ladies unload as quickly as they speak, pushing each other out of the\
  \ way. The driver exhales, \u2013 unlike me, he has witnessed this scene a thousand\
  \ times. I look out of the dusty window to see the crowd of babushkas invade the\
  \ street. They are on a mission."
