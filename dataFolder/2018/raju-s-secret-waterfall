Text: "It started when I went to meet an old friend for drinks. There were a couple\
  \ of other friends, who were discussing about how they would go to Maredumilli as\
  \ they only have one bike.\nSo I jumped in saying,\u201D I have a bike, we can go\
  \ together, if you don\u2019t mind\u201D.\nAnother couple of hours we started our\
  \ journey to Maredumilli. The freezing winter winds slowed us down but we had a\
  \ beautiful sunrise over the river Godavari.\nAs we reached Maredumilli, we were\
  \ going through the scenic curvy mountain roads which were even better with our\
  \ cruisers. We stopped at a view point and went on a trek in the morning.\nBy noon\
  \ we were exhausted and hungry. We took our bikes and went to try the local dish\
  \ Bamboo chicken. There were a lot of hotels which serve Bamboo Chicken. We went\
  \ to the \u201C Sri Duga hotel\u201D. \nWe were greeted by Raju, a 16 year old tall\
  \ and dark boy who was  calling us  \u201Canna\u201D (which means big brother in\
  \ their native language).\nCooking bamboo chicken takes time which was enough time\
  \ for us to have a conversation with our newly found brother Raju.\n\u201COf all\
  \ these hotels selling bamboo chicken only we make it in an authentic tribal way\u201D\
  \ said Raju proudly. He told us how his grandfather was one of the few people who\
  \ started selling bamboo chicken and how all the other hotels grew like mushrooms\
  \ with the increased flow of tourists. He was telling the truth the Bamboo Chicken\
  \ was amazing and had a unique taste. Later he offered to take us to a waterfall\
  \ fall. It was small and beautiful. The best part is one can slide on this little\
  \ water path.\nRaju said it was his secret waterfall and only a few People knew\
  \ this. We relaxed there till evening and watched sunset in the mountains. Raju\
  \ insisted that we should come back in the month of may as there would be a tribal\
  \ festival. Later that evening we bid our farewell to our brother from another mother\
  \ and started  our return journey."
