Text: "Located in the very famous neighborhood of Belfast\u2019s Shaws Road,  the\
  \ Irish community spends hours and hours on different activities in Culturlann Mcadam\
  \ \xF3 Fiaich centre, being their main purpose to keep alive the Irish Gaelic language\
  \ and Irish identity. Loud Celtic music can be heard 50 meters away from the building,\
  \ making you feel as if you\u2019ve entered a new area. A huge Dom is now the first\
  \ thing you see (originally, part of a Protestant church). \n\nAutomatic doors and\
  \ a bunch of posters in tIrish, welcome you to a small cozy caf\xE9. Not one bit\
  \ of English is heard there. There is a young smiling guy at the reception desk\
  \ with a black t-shirt that has a Gaelic saying on it. Naoise \xD3 Caireall\xE1\
  in, is his name and states: \u201C1991 was when 2 activist men first opened this\
  \ place.\u201D\n\nIt started out as a school after the Protestants left the church.\
  \ Young people in Belfast started being aware of the minority situation of their\
  \ language.  As a result, there was a need for schools, which is how An Chult\xFA\
  rlann started. It was the first pure Irish speaking medium school in Belfast, with\
  \ two full-time teachers and nine pupils. Today, with 600 pupils on its register,\
  \ it is the largest one.\n\n\u201CAn Chult\xFArlann on its three floors, has space\
  \ for artistic and theatrical expression with a youth amateur and professional company,\
  \ a caf\xE9, and the north\u2019s largest dedicated Irish Language and media book\
  \ shop,\u201D states Naoise.\nEvery corner of the building is flooded with some\
  \ colorful statements in Gaelic that I am not able to understand. It has been the\
  \ youth organization\xB4s work, which has taken the language out of schools and\
  \ made it a part of socialization, though art, classes, music, and dance.\n\nExploring\
  \ the building, we enter a white echoing room, full of paintings made by local people.\
  \ Naoise follows the explanation while I am unconsciously immersed in some of the\
  \ painting\u2019s colors: \u201CWe encourage young people from Belfast to bring\
  \ their art works here to sell them\u201D.\nWalking back to the ground floor there\
  \ is a library. An old man sat on a couch looks without moving a single finger.\
  \ An aged lady answers at the counter. Apart from offering cultural activities,\
  \ it is important for the community to create jobs. There is the need that the language\
  \ takes part in everyday life situations.\n\n\u201CWe constantly are keeping the\
  \ tradition alive and making it work for the current situation\u201D states Naoise.\
  \ He smiles and takes the mic off as he ends his thought, proud with his final statement."
