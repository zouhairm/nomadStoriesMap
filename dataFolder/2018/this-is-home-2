Text: "Amjid tries to explain but his French is beyond me, so I smile and feign acknowledgement.\
  \ He's detailing the intricacies of soccer and, by his expression, doing a bit of\
  \ bragging as well. He's young still, about nine years old, but he has passion for\
  \ the sport. \n\n\"I speak English\" Amjid states with a thick accent. \"La musique...rap\
  \ music! I know 50 Cent! I rap like motherfucker and\u2014!\" \n\n\"No, no, no\"\
  , I cut him off as the rest of the group bursts into laughter at his enthusiasm.\
  \ Amjid laughs, his smile is all teeth. He\u2019s showing off for us Americans.\
  \ \n\n\"Ne dis pas \xE7a, Amjid!\" I try to admonish him, but I can\u2019t stifle\
  \ my laugh. \n\nHe tells us about his family. They are from Algeria but he hardly\
  \ remembers it. He lives nearby with his mother and older sister. He says we are\
  \ welcome to stay with his family, we can sleep on the couch. I translate this to\
  \ my friends and they chuckle. \n\n\"Oh, I'm sorry but we go home tomorrow,\" Victoria\
  \ tells him sweetly. \n\n\"Home?\" Amjid asks. \n\n\"Oui, aux \xC9tats Unis.\" I\
  \ explain. \n\n\"America! En avion?\" He points up to a plane soaring far above.\
  \ He\u2019s never been on one before. He\u2019s never been anywhere else as far\
  \ as he can remember. We all look up as the plane passes, a marvel we\u2019ve never\
  \ given much thought.\n\nHis face falls a little at this revelation. It's the first\
  \ quiet pause since he left his soccer match to befriend us. \u201CWhy?\u201D he\
  \ asks simply. It\u2019s a hard question to answer when you\u2019re on vacation,\
  \ your routine life on the horizon.\n\nWhy would we leave this place? I feel at\
  \ home in this coastal town. It's only March but we spent most of the day laid out\
  \ on the beach. Now late in the afternoon, the sun is still unwavering and welcomed\
  \ after a week in the northern regions of France. In my memories, Nice feels like\
  \ an island. \n\n\"This is home,\" Amjid replies, his dark arms outstretched as\
  \ he motions to the surrounding neighborhood, the towering apartments forming a\
  \ wall from the nearby sea.\n\nYears later, this is the image I have of Amjid; happy\
  \ and sincere, embracing the city he calls home. I only hope he has kept that optimism\
  \ over time as politics created fear and uncertainty for immigrants like him.  As\
  \ the child of immigrants myself, I know that ultimately all they want is for their\
  \ children to be able to enjoy a game of soccer at a park until dusk and make their\
  \ way home on a well-lit street."
