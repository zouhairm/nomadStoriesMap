Text: "I met the hazy light of a new dawn outside the front door of my friends home.\
  \ Descending the steps of their porch I approached my car and my stomach dropped.\
  \ For a moment my mind didn\u2019t comprehend what I was seeing. The doors of my\
  \ car were all wide open. It seemed as if all the insides of my car had been ripped\
  \ out and pasted onto the pavement on the road. Shards of plastic had erupted from\
  \ my passengers seats and sealed containers filled with food had leeched out into\
  \ the gravel and dirt across the street. I took in the vivid array of color slandering\
  \ the pavement and my breath caught in my throat. I felt a bristling at the nape\
  \ of my neck as I heard curses and rushed footsteps inside the home. \nAs I stepped\
  \ closer to my car, I began to smell the acrid stench of fermenting food and the\
  \ musk of wildlife. I heard voices shouting from the house, but I couldn\u2019t\
  \ hear them in the back of my mind. I peered down at my seats, sopping wet with\
  \ coffee, Cabernet, and bear musk. I saw the drying nose prints across my dashboard.\
  \ \nI felt bitterness creeping up and considered the fact that my trip was about\
  \ to end. But I also felt the small whisper of determination brimming through the\
  \ anxiety and debilitation. \nI had already made the decision. \nI walked myself\
  \ through it carefully. I began to pick at the garbage littering the street. I was\
  \ joined by welcome hands, and soft voices, guiding and encouraging me. Together\
  \ we cleaned up the mayhem. \n\nI drove the next 2,047 miles with the windows down,\
  \ sitting on top of towels and garbage bags tucked neatly around my drivers seat.\
  \ I am still haunted by the smell that is still clinging my upholstery after 2 shampoos\
  \ and several vaccuming sessions. But every time I smell it, I am reminded of all\
  \ the beautiful people that I met, the amazing sights that I saw. But most importantly,\
  \ of that moment. That decision that was already inside of me. Just waiting for\
  \ the opportunity to be unleashed."
