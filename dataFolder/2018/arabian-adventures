Text: "When I landed in Abu Dhabi in the middle of the night I did not imagine my\
  \ holiday in Emirates would be so adventurous. I knew very little about what to\
  \ expect. But when I woke up in the morning and looked through the 34th level window,\
  \ I realized that this trip is going to be so interesting. I was amazed. A breathtaking\
  \ view spread before my eyes. Right there, in the desert, impressive tall buildings\
  \ rise from the sand.  \nSo let the adventure begin! \n  From traditional aspects\
  \ of the desert way of life inside a reconstructed Heritage Village where I could\
  \ discover, explore and learn from craftsmen their traditional skills to one of\
  \ the largest Mosque in the world, an architectural work of art which hosts the\
  \ world\u2019s largest hand-knotted carpet and 24-carat gold chandeliers. \n  From\
  \ highest water slides where literally I was shoot down at an astonishing speed\
  \ of 80km/h to the most exhilarating experience in the fastest roller coaster in\
  \ the world where I was blasted 240km/h in 4.9 seconds.\n  From diving in a huge\
  \ aquarium inside a shopping centre with thousands of marine animals around me to\
  \ driving in the Arabian Desert for a \u201CDune Bashing\u201D experience in a large\
  \ 4x4 car. \n  From old-world souks with pure gold and colourful sacks of spices\
  \ to the largest mall in the world and the tallest tower in the world from which\
  \ I had a spectacular panoramic view over Dubai and its desert from 452m above.\
  \ \n  I must say this was the most intense, fun and adventurous holiday so far.\
  \ Abu Dhabi and Dubai gave me so many \u201Cwow moments\u201D and every day was\
  \ a full day of discovery."
