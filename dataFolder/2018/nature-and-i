Text: "As I planned a trip with my besties to a hill station in a nearby town in between\
  \ our  hectic work schedule. \n Arranged by a local tour guide, we started our journey,\
  \ away from all the pollution n noise and giant concrete, as we travelled through\
  \ the mountains , valleys and the vast jungle, the fresh air and sweet aroma of\
  \ the wild flowers and trees filled us with such great energy and joy which you\
  \ can't expressed as if we and nature coexist for a long time.\nthe sweet sound\
  \ of the wind gushing, the birds, the leaves .. So soothing to hear..\nAll the stress,\
  \ dullness , boredom vanished away and it felt so refreshing, you don't need any\
  \ tv or mobile or internet, feels so content and happiness inside.\nThe color or\
  \ the mountain,valley ,spring water, sky, trees, birds,wild flower as if a giant\
  \ painting has been drawn.\nThe beauty of nature is so overwhelming and amazing\
  \ . \nGOD has created it so wonderfully .. What a beautiful witness \nFelt like\
  \ in heaven for a while...\n\nThe sweet memories of these days will always remain\
  \ in my heart.\nand when I felt low and down cast, remembering these moments makes\
  \ me feel afresh . And renewed my strength again\n     \nMy dairy of Journey\nYapi_"
