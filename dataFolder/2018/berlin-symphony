Text: "On the evening of December 27th, 2017, I arrived in Berlin. I choose 'Heart\
  \ of Gold Hostel' for my stay. All major attractions of Berlin were pretty close\
  \ to the hostel. And, as I was leaving the reception. I saw her entering, draped\
  \ in a black jacket, carrying her heavy suitcase in one hand and a ukulele on the\
  \ other. I felt something special, as she walked past. Maybe, I thought she was\
  \ Indian. After taking few steps, I got an impulse to see her again. So, I ran back\
  \ but could only get a glimpse of her as she walked off to her room. A little disappointed,\
  \ I walked out and headed to the Brandenburg Gate. The monument is 20 minutes\u2019\
  \ walk from the hostel. This 18th-century monument looked magnificent at night.\
  \ Berlin looks pulsating with all the Christmas decorations. Next morning, I saw\
  \ her sitting at the reception. I took a seat close to her. Her brown curly hair\
  \ was tied up neatly, her lips sparked with the red shade lip colour, her big specs\
  \ made her look immensely cute. She was speaking to someone in Spanish over the\
  \ phone. I got to know that she was Spanish, not Indian. I had registered for a\
  \ free walking tour. She was also going for the 'Berlin Walking Tour'. While we\
  \ were walking along the alleys of the city we started talking. We had a great time\
  \ together walking around until late evening. I was not sure what she felt but I\
  \ definitely fancied her. She told me that she would be leaving for Italy tomorrow.\
  \ And then she stood and told me that she wants to leave. I nodded and I walked\
  \ her to her room. I messaged that I would be leaving for Amsterdam, the next morning.\
  \ She did not reply. Later at night we met and sat holding each other's hands. Realizing\
  \ that it was almost morning we got up. And left for the Berlin station. I was not\
  \ ready to say good-bye. We looked at each other, I told her that I liked her and\
  \ she replied that she liked me too. We kissed and parted.I kept on scrolling through\
  \ our pictures on my phone. I wanted to be with her but I had no choice but to leave\
  \ as my VISA was expiring in a couple of days. Eventually, my heart took over my\
  \ brain. I messaged her and asked her where she was going in Italy. She replied,\
  \ \u201CShe was in Recanati\u201D. I left for The Embassy, to get my VISA extended.\
  \ Next morning, I boarded a train from the Netherlands to Basel and then to Recanati.\
  \ I messaged her after reaching the gates of her institute. I waited! And then I\
  \ saw her coming out of the huge gates running towards me smiling."
