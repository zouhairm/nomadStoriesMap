Text: "\u201CTwo!\u201D, exclaims the old man behind the counter, most likely just\
  \ a teenager during the Vietnam War, whilst lifting his calloused fingers into the\
  \ shape of a peace sign. \n\nThe smell of fish persists in the humid market air,\
  \ but my friend and I are looking for a sweeter taste. \n\n\u201CNo, three please\u201D\
  , I answer back, attempting to order bags of k\u1EB9o d\u1EEBa (a local coconut\
  \ candy). \n\nWe are a literal stone's throw away from Ha Long Bay, a uniquely stunning\
  \ site composed of thousands of (mostly) uninhabited, vegetation roofed limestone\
  \ islands. You\u2019ll find locals by the shoreline hawking boat rides to foreigners,\
  \ but this particular stall owner holds other intentions. \n\n\u201CTwo American!\u201D\
  , he says, his pitch rising in accordance with his insistence.\n\nMy friend and\
  \ I look at each other puzzled and on the verge of frustration, but we have both\
  \ spent enough time in Vietnam to know that purchasing anything here is not always\
  \ a straight and orderly path.\n\n\u201CSorry, I\u2019m British and my friend is\
  \ Spanish\u201D, I reply.\n\nWorking women stroll by, smirking at the naive tourists\
  \ under their conical straw hats.\n\nThe mans peace salute then slowly and deliberately\
  \ changes into the shape of a pistol. He points away from us into the middle distance,\
  \ his gaze doesn\u2019t leave ours, \u201CTwo American, Bang Bang!\u201D.\n\nHis\
  \ point is now as unmistakable as the pungent seafood odours wafting through the\
  \ market.\n\nThis old man, with his entire history engraved across the deep recesses\
  \ of his face, then lets loose a smile with as many teeth as his now defunct \u2018\
  peace sign\u2019 had fingers. But something is clear, this is not a smile intended\
  \ to gloat or to intimidate, rather the sincere glint in his eye exudes the pride\
  \ he still holds, 40 years on, from fighting in the \u2018American War\u2019 (as\
  \ it is known here) and defending his homeland.\n\nThe history of Vietnam is rife\
  \ with tales of resistance against various invading forces. The name Ha Long itself\
  \ means \u201Cdescending dragon\u201D, and local stories tell of dragons sent down\
  \ in ancient times as guardians who in an effort to protect the area from attacking\
  \ ships spat jewels into the water which formed into the islands of the bay we see\
  \ today. \n\nMy friend and I sit by the waters edge, dangling our feet above our\
  \ own reflections. A rickety fishing boat soon pulls up, manned by a keen father\
  \ and son team. They offer us a ride and I offer them some candy. We jump aboard\
  \ ship and float into the surrounding scenery of water and stone, eager to explore\
  \ these jewels for ourselves."
