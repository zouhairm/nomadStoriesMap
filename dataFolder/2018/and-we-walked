Text: "Being the only girl in a group of boy scouts is hard. Being the only girl in\
  \ a group of boy scouts with an I'm-as-strong-as-all-of-you-attitude is even harder.\
  \ But here I was. 17 years old. Spain. 20 kilograms of a backpack. Girl. 30 degrees\
  \ in the shadows. August. \n\nThey asked us to separate in three groups. A weak\
  \ hiking group for the slow walkers. A middle group for the normal people. And extreme\
  \ group for the insane people. They told me this group is just for real men. 90\
  \ kilometres in four days. I chose the extreme.\n\nIt started pretty good. Hiking.\
  \ Hills up. Hills down. Through woods. Through little towns. Followed a river or\
  \ two. Another hill. Another forest. Even found a ruin of a castle. Slept next to\
  \ a graveyard. Drank Spanish wine out of tea cups. You know\u2026 that\u2019s what\
  \ you do as a scout.\n\nWhenever I needed a break I drank a sip of water and just\
  \ continued walking. And I said nothing about wanting to sit in the grass and never\
  \ getting up again. I said nothing about my hurting legs or feet. I said nothing\
  \ about wanting to go home. I just kept on walking.\n\nThe next day someone decided\
  \ to follow the dotted line on the map. He told us that\u2019s a shortcut. It wasn\u2019\
  t. We walked through a forest. Between the trees was not a path in sight. There\
  \ were just raspberry tendrils, thistles, thorns and so on. As it was so hot I was\
  \ wearing very short shorts. Bad idea. To this day I can still see some of the scars.\n\
  \nSuddenly we stood at the bottom of a hill. But not the kind of hill you can walk\
  \ up. We had to climb. I immediately wanted to turn around and go home. As I\u2019\
  m very afraid of heights. There was no way that I\u2019d be able to climb that mountain.\
  \ Nope! No! Never! Not in a lifetime!\n\nDon\u2019t ask me how. I was sure that\
  \ I\u2019d die on the way up. That I\u2019d fall. That there would be a landslide.\
  \ But I got up that hill! With the help of a rope and my friends. Still wearing\
  \ my heavy backpack. Cursing the whole time.\n\nI got rewarded with the most beautiful\
  \ view. Behind hills and hills there was the sea. Up there was the wind. The sun.\
  \ It was beautiful. And we were surrounded by even more raspberry tendrils, thistles,\
  \ thorns. I sighed and we kept on hiking.\n\nHills up. Hills down. Through woods.\
  \ Through little towns. Followed a river or two. Another hill. Another forest. We\
  \ walked the whole rest of the tour.\n\nAs we arrived at the meeting point it was\
  \ close to midnight. We walked the whole 90 kilometres in just three days. I unpacked\
  \ my sleeping bag and instantly fell asleep."
