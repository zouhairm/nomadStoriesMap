Text: "Mfuwe left me with more of a profound inexplicable impression than actual words.\
  \ On the surface, it is a little village on the edge of the South Luangwa National\
  \ Park. Delightfully rural. Fresh air, long stretches of clear blue skies drawn\
  \ over acres and acres of grass, trees and dust.\n\nAnd while that might sound a\
  \ little dismal, it really isn\u2019t. Upon this stretch of land is where Zambia\u2019\
  s big five roam, play and hunt! Where some of the greatest adventure stories unfold.\
  \ Tales of bravery, wit and cunning.  And yes-even love. Honestly, it truly is the\
  \ makings of Lion King 3.\n\nFrom my vantage point inside of the Land Rover, I have\
  \ witnessed some of the most elaborate hunting schemes. From oxbow ambush maneuvres\
  \ by a pride of Lions to Leopards rolling about in giraffe urine in order to cast\
  \ off their own scent before stealthily creeping upon their prey. Such a thrill!\n\
  \nBut even in the midst of all this excitement, there is a sense of quiet tranquillity\
  \ that permeates the air, a life force circulating a reassuring sense of wellbeing\
  \ that I believe stems from an incontestable evidence that nature is capable of\
  \ taking care of itself. That if humans don\u2019t interfere negatively that is,\
  \ then nature will find an ecological balance and coexist in harmony.\n\nAnd so\
  \ it is with great comfort that you will slip into a new pattern of early morning\
  \ game drives, punctuated by informative narration from extremely knowledgeable\
  \ guides, sumptuous meals in between and glorious sunsets overlooking the plain.\n\
  \nThe highlight for me though was the school visits. As I was staying at Mfuwe Lodge,\
  \ it is through the Bush Camp company that I got to find out about the projects\
  \ within the community that are designed to support education as part of the drive\
  \ toward responsible tourism.\n\nOne such school I went to was Uyoba Community Primary\
  \ School. It has a total of 700 pupils, six classrooms and only twelve teachers.\
  \ It\u2019s not hard to see the problem in this equation. It creates a student to\
  \ teacher ratio of 58 to one. And bless them, the teachers really do a phenomenal\
  \ job with the limited resources available. There is a lot more that can be said\
  \ on the subject. And even more that should be done.\n\nBut if you ask me, this\
  \ is the real treasure in Mfuwe. The warmth and spirit of togetherness in this community.\
  \ The gift of being part of something that transcends my temporal visit. To be a\
  \ part of a development plan that builds and shapes lives."
