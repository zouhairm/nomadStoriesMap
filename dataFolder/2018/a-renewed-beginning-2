Text: "By losing yourself completely can you then be forced to find sanctuary in the\
  \ depths of our unknown. It is in these catalytic moments that we are sparked to\
  \ find ourselves because in our darkness we are able to dig deep within, finding\
  \ the strength and urgency to seek a beacon of hope. A light that may lead us to\
  \ a renewed beginning for life was never meant to be dim. On March 23, 2017 I got\
  \ on a plane to Thailand having never traveled alone I was in a complete frenzy\
  \ to think that at the age of 23 I could do such a thing by myself. Being a middle\
  \ child of two Mexicans that worked long hours and who's hopes and dreams frequently\
  \ fluttered in my mind, made no sense to a wanderlust, dreamer who's feet hardly\
  \ touched the ground. Having wished upon so many stars in the black abyss of the\
  \ night to one day go off to a place where one could relish in the beauty of life\
  \ and live profoundly, deeply in the ambitions to make a change in the world was\
  \ what I had always yearned for. My 10-day tour to Thailand began with orientation\
  \ where I met 14 individuals whom till this day I consider a second family. Having\
  \ come from countries such as The United Kingdom, Scotland, Argentina, Germany but\
  \ also differing in age made no difference to how close we all became in the span\
  \ of 10 days. That first night after our orientation we all went out to Koh San\
  \ Road a glorious gem that conveyed a cluster of people from all over the world\
  \ joined together to have a moment of utter happiness. The energy in the air is\
  \ best described as waiting for the clock to strike twelve at midnight when you're\
  \ waiting to bring in the New Year. Not quite understanding what the excitement\
  \ of it is but all the more invigoratingly, intoxicatingly momentous. I could not\
  \ explain just how earth shattering it felt to walk along the beaches of Thailand\
  \ and witness the sky explode into bright oranges and yellows, splattered with hues\
  \ of purple and pink to display a canvas of colors that appeared as though there\
  \ could never be a sight as vividly beautiful as their sunsets. Traveling to Thailand\
  \ may seem like clich\xE9 to many but for me it was the beginning of an on going\
  \ ripple effect that has yet to have an end. I will forever miss waking up to the\
  \ serenity of the morning but most of all I will miss the guy stationed at bunk\
  \ 23, for he will be one of my fondest memories to linger. In my eyes I now hold\
  \ the twinkle and gleam of what travel truly beholds."
