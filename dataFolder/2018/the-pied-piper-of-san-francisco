Text: "I had tuned out of anything else around me, intent on following the melodious\
  \ tune of the bagpipes I could hear in the near distance. There was something about\
  \ the music, it was ethereal, alluring \u2013 almost like an invisible force was\
  \ pulling me towards it.\n\nIt was a Tuesday afternoon in San Francisco and a blanket\
  \ of white fog enveloped the city. Heavy traffic, packs of tourists chattering and\
  \ workers hurriedly heading back to their offices brought the city to life. I was\
  \ aware of the commotion, yet at the same time, I felt alone and entranced, each\
  \ weightless step I took pulling me closer to the mellifluous bagpipes.\n\nBefore\
  \ me I saw wrought iron gates, open and inviting, emerald green in colour with the\
  \ slightest flecks of black. The music was nearing. Above the gate there was an\
  \ arch with leaves and branches cast in iron, with reddish and golden hues, intertwining\
  \ with the gilded lettering that read \u2018Shakespeare Garden.\u2019\n\nBeyond\
  \ the gates lay a  dark red herringbone brick pathway with small cherry blossom\
  \ trees lining both sides. I trailed further into the gardens. The grass was a lush\
  \ green. The music had closed in. A sundial sat upon a pedestal made of stone in\
  \ the middle of the pathway. Nothing about this place was ostentatious. It was simplistic,\
  \ yet beguiling.\n\nAnd then I saw him, the Pied Piper, the enchanting force that\
  \ had led me to this oasis in the middle of San Francisco. He stood under one of\
  \ the larger trees, his fingers dancing delicately on the pipe as he played.\n\n\
  After walking the short distance around the garden, I sat on a bench and breathe\
  \ in the aromas of bark and loam that filled the air. The sun was hitting me at\
  \ just the right angle, casting a warm glow on my face. A deep sense of serenity\
  \ washed over me. \n\nThe Pied Piper played while I watched other passers-by happen\
  \ upon the garden. Although strangers, I felt connected to them. An unspoken force\
  \ had brought us all here together at this same time to revere in the effortlessness\
  \ of both the garden and its music.\n\nAn older man was practising Tai Chi, like\
  \ the Pied Piper, he was completely transfixed on his art, transfixed by his surroundings.\
  \ \n\nA man of about 70 took a seat on the bench beside me, exhaling a deep sigh\
  \ of relief as he finally rested his tired feet. I looked at him. He looked at me.\
  \ We both smiled as he tipped his cap towards me.\n\nI\u2019m not sure how long\
  \ I stayed on that bench people watching for but it felt like a lifetime and a split\
  \ second all at the same time."
