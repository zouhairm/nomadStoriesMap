Text: "The metallic sounds hovered over the river, echoing on the trees in the distant\
  \ margin. We watched the boats floating down-river, red and bright yellow flags\
  \ waving high on top of bamboo sticks. On the top deck, a Dayak young boy danced\
  \ shirtless, moving like a hunter, holding a painted shield and spear. His colorful\
  \ shorts waved with the breeze making his movements more fluid and mysterious -\
  \ resembling hunters in the forest, chasing their prey between dense leaves.\nThe\
  \ repetitive sound of the metal bowls, hitting you with the burning sun, helped\
  \ you enter in an almost hypnotic state. And the boat continued on and on, moving\
  \ up-river and floating back slowly, with the current. Moments later, it touched\
  \ the margin and members of the community threw the clear water of the river on\
  \ the boat, blessing its flags, the forest, the musicians, the dancer and the river\
  \ itself.\n We followed the people to the decorated entrance. At gate, the village\
  \ chief, holding a chicken high in his hands, recited words of hope for good harvest\
  \ in the coming year. Red, black and yellow flags with tribal drawings waved high\
  \ atop bamboo sticks and vime ribbons hanged from an arch, making a curtain door.\
  \ Beyond the curtain, women danced and sung, holding rice cakes and tuag - the local\
  \ alcohol. Dressed in colorful dresses, with their asian shiny-black hair decorated\
  \ with beads, and a red and yellow ribbon tied around their heads, they danced happily.\
  \ As we walked through this corridor of dancers, they fed us to our mouths and gave\
  \ us to drink, competing to be the next one from whose cup we drank. Fighting to\
  \ swallow all we were given, we slowly moved along this corridor, reaching the shadow\
  \ under a shed, where village officials stood. A large group of young people performed\
  \ one last traditional dance, portraying stories about life in the rainforest.\n\
  Thus began our stay at the harvest celebrations of a Dayak tribe in Indonesia -\
  \ the descendants of the native people who, for centuries, inhabited the Rainforests\
  \ of Kalimantan Island. During a week, we dove deeper and deeper into this culture.\
  \ We were hosted in their homes, ate rice harvested in nearby fields and the fish\
  \ caught in the waters of the Embalo river. \nIt\u2019s remarkable how much these\
  \ people love and respect the forest. If in Jawa, volcanoes are gods, in Kalimantan,\
  \ the Forest is. They depend on it, the water and food it provides, the wood that\
  \ shelters them. And this mother dictates their fates."
