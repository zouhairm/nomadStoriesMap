Text: "Annie was studying Spanish and international relations at university in 2008.\
  \ Annie had taken a year out to work abroad and improve her language skills. She\
  \ set off to Argentina, confident that her placement will be exactly what she was\
  \ hoping for; working in a school, in a busy city where Annie could meet a lot of\
  \ people and experience a different culture.  \nAfter arriving in Argentina, Annie\
  \ follows her itinerary but ended up in a small town in the heart of the Argentinian\
  \ countryside. Unfortunately, this was not the placement that she was hoping for;\
  \ Annie was working at the town school which had 45 children. She stayed in a hotel\
  \ but soon realised had to book her own accommodation. Annie tries to contact her\
  \ university but there was no phone signal and very limited WIFI.\nA stranger stopped\
  \ to talk to Annie in the local coffee shop when Annie was crying into her tea.\
  \ Annie explained her situation to the stranger. Her Spanish was not as good as\
  \ it should have been and no one spoke English in the small town. Feeling helpless\
  \ and distressed, Annie is offered a position at a local farm by the kind stranger.\
  \ She can earn some money helping out and save enough to get herself back to the\
  \ city. \nAnnie starts work on the farm and is way out of her depth. However, Annie\
  \ grew to love her work. The farm had several horses that need cared for. Annie\u2019\
  s language skills improve and she falls in love with the quiet countryside and stays\
  \ working at the farm as the spring turns into summer. The quiet countryside starts\
  \ to awaken. The farm is packed with people coming to ride and compete at polo so\
  \ Annie is incredibly busy. She meets lots of new people and her Spanish improves\
  \ drastically.\nOne point her hosts suggests that she tried playing polo with some\
  \ of the beginners. Annie is a natural and finds a thrill in the sport. Throughout\
  \ the Argentinian summer she competes and improves. The owner askes Annie whether\
  \ she would like to travel and compete with his own team. \nAnnie accepts and gets\
  \ to explore the vast countryside of Argentina, meeting people from all different\
  \ backgrounds involved in the sport. Annie gets to visit all the cities, experience\
  \ the culture and a romance blossoms between her and her teammate. Annie finally\
  \ gets access to the internet and discovers that she has been missing. Annie must\
  \ leave choose whether to leave the country that she has fallen in love with and\
  \ continue her life in the UK or to risk everything and stay in Argentina."
