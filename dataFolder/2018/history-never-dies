Text: "A romantic poet might say that the steep, crumbling embankments that closed\
  \ us in on either side were a thematic parallel to the feeling of claustrophobia\
  \ that propelled us down an overgrown Mississippi lane. Desperate for adventure\
  \ we\u2019d traveled everywhere that four wheels and a long weekend could take us.\
  \ Eventually we\u2019d reached the point where we, two sophomores in college, had\
  \ seen everything there was to see in our corner of the world.\n \nWe began to seek\
  \ out leads to find someplace, anyplace, new and interesting. It wasn\u2019t long\
  \ before we began to piece together strings of rumors and hand-me-down family narratives\
  \ that referenced something which captivated our interest. \n \nThey spoke of a\
  \ Confederate ghost town. \n \nWe heard from unrelated people, on both sides of\
  \ the Mississippi River, stories passed down in families regarding an old river\
  \ town, shelled and abandoned during the American Civil War, that sat vacant and\
  \ empty, preserved like a living museum somewhere along the river. \n \nNaturally\
  \ no one had seen it. There were no evident signs along the meandering river itself,\
  \ no steeples or roofs which one might glimpse from the deck of a passing ship.\
  \ No one could identify the name of the alleged town, only claim that it existed.\
  \ \n \nOur sense of adventure piqued, we followed leads as questionable as the suspicious\
  \ path through dense undergrowth they eventually led us down. Cellular reception\
  \ was non-existent. Our atlas was useless on that unmarked, rutted trail. \n \n\
  Yet seemingly in an instant, myth became reality. From a bare trail in the forest\
  \ to a sudden clearing awash with sunlight and daffodils, there, only yards away,\
  \ was a weed-choked street, flanked on either side by crumbling brick structures;\
  \ houses and municipal buildings like silent sentinels. In the center, a brick church\
  \ stood, boarded and locked, with a belfry stranding tall and proud. We noticed\
  \ with a collective gasp that in its fa\xE7ade, as real as the Union gunboat which\
  \ had once fired on this town, was lodged a cannonball \u2013 a remnant of a time\
  \ before the river had shifted course and bypassed this village to die and become\
  \ irrelevant. \n \nBut history never really dies in the South. It had beckoned to\
  \ us in rumors that we couldn\u2019t ignore. Finally, it spoke to us from a plaque\
  \ that someone had affixed to the church identifying this lost place as the village\
  \ of Rodney, Mississippi. History changed us that day forever, standing alone in\
  \ the sun, spellbound by the power an actual ghost town."
