Text: "The last thing I expected to be doing in Copenhagen was cleaning other peoples\
  \ shit. I was strapped for cash and needed a job, fast. My friend had a contact\
  \ at a hotel 35 minutes outside of the city. After a five minute interview I signed\
  \ a contract and was scheduled for my first training shift the following week. \n\
  \nI'm originally from Canada and I decided to move to Copenhagen for a 6-month internship.\
  \ The internship was unpaid, part-time and when it finished I was planning to do\
  \ a 5-6 month escapade through Europe. What I hadn't realized was that 4 months\
  \ into my stay in Copenhagen I would drain nearly all my savings, and if I didn't\
  \ find a job I would be booking a flight home faster than I could say Europe 2018.\
  \ I was desperate. \n\nThe first two shifts at the hotel were painstakingly boring;\
  \ I watched an expert, a non-native english speaker (who I later found out is a\
  \ mother, and spends evenings at school studying chemical engineering) clean rooms\
  \ for 4 hours. I attempted to digest the lightning fast bed-folding maneuvers and\
  \ toilet scrubbing wrist movements to the best of my ability. After two days I thought\
  \ to myself, \"this won't be so bad. I can listen to my music, clean the rooms and\
  \ get paid.\" Little did I know I was going to face one of the most physically and\
  \ mentally challenging jobs of my 23 year life. \n\nThe shift starts at 9am sharp,\
  \ but you have to arrive at least ten minutes early in order to pick the best trolly\
  \ and vacuum. All the housekeepers get a list of room numbers; you have 20 minutes\
  \ to clean each checked-out room, and 5 minutes for every in-house room (rooms that\
  \ are still occupied by guests). It can be broken down to a science: 3 minutes per\
  \ bed, 7 minutes for the bathroom, 3 minutes to vacuum, the rest for dusting, adding\
  \ towels, replacing coffee, soaps, etc. But what they don't tell you is the extra\
  \ time it takes to make things perfect. It took me 4 weeks until I could make a\
  \ bed without a wrinkle; I've wasted 5 minutes scrubbing a toilet that was desecrated;\
  \ and I've audibly screamed at my vacuum for not sucking up little pieces of dust\
  \ fast enough. After each shift my back aches, my feet throb, my knees creak and\
  \ my fingernails are so clean they hurt. I envied the women who came to work smiling.\
  \ \n\nAfter two months, I put in my resignation. I made enough money to carry me\
  \ on my way, but I left with more than just money. I left with an appreciation for\
  \ the under appreciated; I learned to be humble."
