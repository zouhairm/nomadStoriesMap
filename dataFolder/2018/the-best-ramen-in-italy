Text: "\"Why are you here?\"\n\nThe question wasn't unfriendly. The two men at the\
  \ table next to us just looked genuinely confused. How, and why, had these two obvious\
  \ tourists wandered into a little ramen shop on one of the side streets of Turin,\
  \ Italy? The menu didn't have an English version and the waiter had just had to\
  \ look up a picture of cilantro on his phone to ask me if I wanted it. He didn't\
  \ know the English word and I definitely didn't know the Japanese or Italian word.\
  \ It looked as though the guys next to us had spent the last 15 minutes silently\
  \ going through the possibilities:\n\n-Drunk and hungry \n-Lost and hungry\n-Pasta-hating\
  \ freaks \n\nThe real truth was boring: the place smelled good as we walked by.\
  \ Northern Italian staples--burrata, chocolate, and Barbera wine had put their spell\
  \ on me. I could have sustained on cream puffs and pasta with pistachios until the\
  \ end of my days. But I'm also not one to pass up a killer bowl of ramen. We had\
  \ spent the previous night cozying up with Google translate  as we sifted through\
  \ Yelp pictures of the menu--it was clearly a place very few tourists even knew\
  \ existed. Why would they, when little bakeries offering tender pastries and trattorias\
  \ lined the streets, beckoning with their rich scents?  \n\nBecause the shop was\
  \ so tiny, our table was about a foot from theirs. That first question opened the\
  \ door and suddenly all four of us were pushing ourselves through it--one man was\
  \ a native, his friend a British expat. Our bowls, emptied, sat as the minutes flew\
  \ by; beers were ordered. In those minutes, we talked about everything--where we\
  \ were from, food we loved, even politics. We left without any way to get in touch--but\
  \ connected by a mutual love of ramen and good conversation. \n\nFood speaks. Sometimes,\
  \ it surprises you. I've been to ramen shops in both Tokyo and New York, with objectively\
  \ better soup. But that little shop in Torino spoke to the real fun of travel--feeling\
  \ like part of local culture."
