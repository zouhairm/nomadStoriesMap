Text: "So I am spending my last night in Tokyo in Capsule18 at Narita Airport. This\
  \ place really blows my mind! What a genius idea for a busy place like Tokyo! And\
  \ really-what do you need when you only have a few hours to wait for your next airplane,\
  \ that brings you to another magical place on this planet! You need a place to sleep.\
  \ \n\nThey give you a little bag with goodies at reception.\nShoes, a toothbrush,\
  \ shampoo, earplugs, things like that.\n\nYou have to wear a special outfit, that\
  \ makes you look like you\u2019re about to have surgery.\nThere is a big change\
  \ room with lockers, toilets and showers, all separated from the sleeping-area,\
  \ and then you step through this door and it seems, you enter another world somehow.\
  \ \nThe whole thing looks like a beehive; there are at least 100 pods inside, and\
  \ the light is warm and it is very quiet, almost reminds you of a futuristic meditation\
  \ hall.\n\nAs I make my way into my pod, I realize, how spacious they actually are,\
  \ how pleasant it feels inside. \nI hear this breathing sound and I think, it must\
  \ be my pod-buddy from next door, but no, there is a little adjustable button in\
  \ every pod, so you can turn the volume up and down. I turn it off, because it freaks\
  \ me out a little bit.\nAnd then I hear a snoring sound, but that actually IS my\
  \ pod-buddy, so I cannot turn that off and have to use my earplugs instead. \n\n\
  And you know that feeling, when something is so great, you don't want to go to sleep,\
  \ because you want to make it last longer? That's how I feel with the capsule-experience.\
  \ So I am thinking about activities I can do in there. First, I have dinner in my\
  \ pod; I do a couple of yoga-poses to stretch out; I do some reading and writing\
  \ and take some pictures; I have a look around if anyone else is up to something,\
  \ but I don't think anyone else is as excited about this as me; I go outside to\
  \ climb back in, and I wonder, if, when I wake up, it will be year 3017 and i am\
  \ teleported to a different planet.\n\nWhen I wake up, it is still 2017, and I am\
  \ in a plane to Nepal.\n\nOn my arrival in Kathmandu the very next day, I realize\
  \ though, Pod No18 really DID work. I popped out in a completely different world\
  \ again, and also I did time travelling, because they are celebrating New Years\
  \ Day here, the Start of 2074. Wow. I skipped 57 years, I am 100 years old, and\
  \ I have to say, all those Lotions and the Yoga must have worked pretty well, because\
  \ I feel great! \n\nAnd Kathmandu? Love on the first sight!\nBut that\u2019s another\
  \ story\u2026"
