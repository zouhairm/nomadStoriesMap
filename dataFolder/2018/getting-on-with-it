Text: "The day my black miniature schnauzer died I was moving to South Korea. He disappeared\
  \ into the darkness in my parents\u2019 backyard at 3 am. When we couldn\u2019t\
  \ find him, I left, crying through the 15 hour plane ride. When I arrived in South\
  \ Korea, my parents told me they had discovered him under his favorite tree.  Still,\
  \ I had to go on. I was thrown into my new job, in a new country. My grief would\
  \ have to wait. \n\nUam Historic Park sits on a ridge of hills on the east side\
  \ of Daejeon, South Korea. It is a gateway to trails that lead into a vast forest.\
  \ The park houses a school from the 1600s scholar, Song Si-Yeol, with a temple,\
  \ lily pond, and museum. I had researched the park and trails so my love of hiking\
  \ would continue. Every day I visited Uam or the paths that weaved up the mountain.\
  \ New sights gave new pleasures. Green bamboo with feather leaves grew along the\
  \ ancient park walls. The burgundy Buddhist temple with its green painted roof sat\
  \ at the top of the hill. Along one of the trails above the park, there is a resting\
  \ station covered by a yellow tarp where travelers can sleep in cots, drink from\
  \ the spring, or eat. My wounds were patched.\n\nThen, after two months, grief struck\
  \ me. One night I woke crying from another nightmare where his death was my fault.\
  \ I was sweating, and alone. Hikes did not heal the wound now hemorrhaging. I could\
  \ not go on this way. I devised a plan. \n\nOn an autumn Sunday morning, I headed\
  \ to a spot overlooking the lake. He walked with me over roots and brown leaves,\
  \ past exercising equipment, and the relaxing station. I thought of wise words.\
  \ Laurence Gonzalez states in Surviving Survival, \u201C\u2026it\u2019s important\
  \ to realize that we don\u2019t get over it. We get on with it.\u201D We let go\
  \ so we can make space for other things. I was desperate to get on with it and make\
  \ room. So atop that hill I sat, unable to speak, on a rock and looked down the\
  \ slope of the trail.  Finally, I recounted my sin- selfishness. I forgave myself,\
  \ and remembered him. Then I ripped up the letter and buried it on that hill. Part\
  \ of him was there and a portion of me too, so the forest had become sacred. The\
  \ wound healed, but the scar remained. \n\nI found desert trails in Saint George,\
  \ Utah, with him. Before that there were trails in Indiana. Many years before that,\
  \ there was the forest in Illinois. In South Korea my forest was an ancient forest\
  \ full of miracles as every day as the healing of a grief stricken human."
