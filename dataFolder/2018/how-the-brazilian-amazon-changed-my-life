Text: "It was mid-July, after an extremely tiring semester in College, I got a call\
  \ from my dad. He asked how the therapy go and if I had  another crisis for the\
  \ past three days. I gave all the details of my week. He, suspicious, asked what\
  \ would be my yearnings for the beginning of the holidays. I answered quietly, I\
  \ didn't expect much, was focused on being near them, finding the calm that I was\
  \ needing. \"Aurora, you go to Manaus, Amazonas.\" That surprised me. He explained\
  \ that he had been thinking about how I needed to rediscover, acquire confidence,\
  \ give my own footsteps and do things that fill me with joy. He said I needed. One\
  \ of the first impressions I had of Manaus was your incredible architectural beauty.\
  \ A historic city and port located in the center of the largest tropical forest\
  \ in the world. My first stop was the Adolpho Lisboa Municipal market, which I found\
  \ to be the third oldest of the city, and, as well as the Amazonas Theater and the\
  \ Palace of Justice, was part of the buildings from the late 19th century, at the\
  \ time the capital flourished thanks to the rubber cycle. The historical aspects\
  \ that hovered around every corner of the city inebriavam me, carrying my soul somewhere\
  \ until then, unknown to her. At the fair Manaus Moderna, I experienced the Tucuman,\
  \ a fresh fruit typical of the region that helps in the treatment of diabetes, I\
  \ ate ants, I was able to enjoy the best acai berry in my life. I tried the pato\
  \ no tucupi, famous local dish, which is the meat of the duck into a kind of sauce\
  \ that is extracted from the root of the cassava, with tacac\xE1, a plant that makes\
  \ a slight numbness in the mouth. It was an explosion of colors, flavors and information\
  \ that made me smile, each new discovery. I went to the meeting of the waters of\
  \ the Rio Negro and Solim\xF5es. Spotted dolphins during the tour. I felt victorious\
  \ every smile, every spasm of happiness, a feeling that was unknown to me until\
  \ that moment. On the way back, we stopped at some of the riverside communities\
  \ and Indigenous handicrafts Centre. Understand that level of culture and reflect\
  \ about how wonderful miscegenation within one of the richest countries in the world,\
  \ diversity was stupendous. A visit to the Teatro Amazonas and the Palace of Justice\
  \ was one of the most transcendental experiences that I could try. The imprescionante\
  \ architecture of the theater, which opened in 1896, shone elegance.  July 2015\
  \ after there were no more fears.I Dropped out of therapy."
