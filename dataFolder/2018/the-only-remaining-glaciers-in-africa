  \ am going to live! Ask my shoes!\u2019 Flash back to 19/6/2017 when the journey\
  \ to the Rwenzori Mountains began. We left Nairobi, Kenya by bus at 6:30 pm and\
  \ arrived at 9:00 am in Kampala, Uganda. We then drove to Entebbe. The next day\
  \ we set out to the headquarters of Rwenzori Mountains National Park and arrived\
  \ at 6 pm. Thursday morning we were up and about packing our back packs and testing\
  \ safety equipment. After preparations, we left for the park gate at noon. Mahoma\
  \ Nature Trail cuts across the grassland past Bakonjo homes into the forest along\
  \ Mubuku River and Mahoma River. A steep rocky ridge led us to Nyabitaba Hut 2570m\
  \ after 4 hours. The next day at 9:20 am we headed out. In the afternoon, we passed\
  \ Nyamuleju rock shelter. Thereafter, we crossed Bujuku River into John Matte Hut\
  \ 3420m at 5:30 pm. Day 3 began with a clear view of Margherita Glacier at 7:50\
  \ am. Soon after, we left for Bujuku Hut 3962m crossing Bujuku River up to Bigo\
  \ Camp. A steep rocky section past Bigo Camp gives way to alpine zone. Behold, was\
  \ a long board walk to ease the trek across the deep bog. Thereafter, we went down\
  \ to Lake Bujuku, a beautiful glacier lake. We got to camp at 3:30 pm. On Sunday,\
  \ the trail goes through viewpoints of Lake Bujuku, Mount Stanley, Mount Speke and\
  \ Mount Baker. We got to Elena Hut 4012m facing Margherita Peak, the target at 2:30\
  \ pm. We retired early to bed and awoke at 1:00 am to prepare and leave for the\
  \ peak. At 3 am we left camp. After 2 hours we got to the snowline of Stanley Plateau\
  \ and put on crampons to navigate it. We eventually got to the start of Margherita\
  \ Glacier at day break. After a breather, we were hooked to safety. Once on safety,\
  \ the climb began with left hands on the rope and ice-axes on the right hands chipping\
  \ off the ice. It was a strenuous climb not devoid of drama! At one point, Nick\
  \ hang onto the rope after his crampons came out. Luckily, they did not go into\
  \ a crevasse or fly far away from guides\u2019 reach. After hours of work we got\
  \ to the end of the rope. We sat on melting snow holding onto ice-axes as the guides\
  \ secured the rope further up. Once ready, we continued to the end of the glacier.\
  \ Behold, we were above the clouds in the midst of beautiful mountains. We unfastened\
  \ crampons to rock climb a short stretch to a rest point. At 1:30 pm we left for\
  \ Margherita Peak 5109m, 30 minutes away. Half an hour later we descended and got\
  \ to Elena Hut at 11:30 pm."
