Text: "Rivers cascade down the streets of Hanoi and flood the city with fish. The\
  \ tail of an electric blue Yamaha Exciter rudders it in and out of traffic, a cruising\
  \ Honda Cub veers off forging a new tributary down a powerline garlanded alleyway.\
  \ At a rare set of traffic lights, this great shoal sits in wait. Fifty necks crane,\
  \ all are anxious for a green light. I, on my flame red Bridgestone bicycle, stare\
  \ straight ahead at the open water. My ears are tuned for a different cue.\n\nA\
  \ wave builds. Humming engines swell. At the flash of green. A deafening rev.  In\
  \ the second it takes for that twist of the throttle to pump petrol to these fifty\
  \ odd engines, I have become an Olympic swimmer. I kick off from the pavement and\
  \ glide momentarily before my right leg, driving down on the pedal, propels me to\
  \ the head of the wave.\n\nMy commute amuses the locals; look at this rich Westerner\
  \ trying to overtake us on that rickety old thing. Yet, my fellow expats are dismayed.\
  \ In their eyes I''m bottom of the food chain, plankton; fodder for every other\
  \ vehicle on the road.\n\nI see their point. These waters are choppy at the best\
  \ of times. Any misjudgement of the current can pull you under. Coiled bodies are\
  \ often spat out onto the shore or trapped under the 100kg weight of a whirling\
  \ 2 stroke Minsk, legs and back skinned along the riverbed.\n\nBut I\u2019m a little\
  \ fish who, as yet, doesn\u2019t possess the strength or skill to be anything bigger.To\
  \ dive in here, untrained, would put me and those around me at great risk. In this\
  \ sea of chaos I can, at the very least, control myself. I trust my fellow commuters\
  \ to do the same.\n***\nI\u2019m on my way to finalise my work visa at the Department\
  \ of Justice in Ha Dong, a growing suburb, south of the city. A stretch of empty\
  \ water opens out in front of me.  \n\nOn.\n\nI push.\n\nOn.\n\nMy legs.\n\nAche\n\
  \nOn\n\nFar off, two emerging tower blocks rise up out of nothing; they are no closer\
  \ than before.\n\nI grunt\n\nI push\n\nI sigh\n\nAdrift\n\nI long for my fellow\
  \ commuters. Not because of the \u2018help\u2019 I\u2019m occasionally offered;\
  \ suggestions I hook my left foot around the motorbike\u2019s footpeg and relax\
  \ while I\u2019m towed along, like swimming with dolphins. No, I long for the energy\
  \ created by others. This energy powers my legs into a pedalling blur. I feed on\
  \ it as I leap in and out of the slipstreams forged by faster fish, as I swerve\
  \ to avoid wandering pedestrians and  race ahead to catch the bus; shielded  when\
  \ crossing intersections by this Jonah filled whale.\n\nPlankton? Where?"
