Text: "We arrive at the edge of civilization. As I exit the van I see them, those\
  \ dreaded beasts of memories past; I see the camels. \n\nAs a young girl, I visited\
  \ Morocco on a family trip. I remember the smell of tea permeating the rugs my mother\
  \ haggled over, the bursts of hot color from the cool stoned lined stalls. Most\
  \ of all I remember riding a camel. And hating it. A decade later the distrust still\
  \ sits in my mouth: I swore I\u2019d never willingly ride a camel again. \nHowever,\
  \ it turns out there\u2019s still only one way to cross the desert. \n\nThe Berber\
  \ guides that will take us into the Sahara lead me toward the pale behemoth that\
  \ sits at the front of the line; Amallale is the jewel of the herd; fast, strong,\
  \ and, for the night, mine. I climb between the white mountains of his back. Foreboding\
  \ fills my belly and unease constricts my heart. Then he unbuckles those spindled\
  \ legs and we rise to our full height. Suddenly, I\u2019m a dessert nymph, riding\
  \ a piece of starlight into the moon dusted sands of the infinite yonder. Where\
  \ did this sense of power come from: am I drunk off the magic of the desert? Or\
  \ maybe, just maybe, when you put yourself in the way of beauty, it\u2019s impossible\
  \ not to feel deliriously alive. \n\nWhen we arrive at camp, I dismount with the\
  \ promise of another ride tomorrow. Friendships form over laughter, shared plates,\
  \ and haphazard attempts at dancing. Tired, my fellow travelers disperse while I,\
  \ restless, wander to the tent city\u2019s edge. \n\n\u201COver here,\u201D a voice\
  \ calls. Luz, one of my new companions, pops her head up. At the foot of the camel\u2019\
  s quarters, Luz and her brother are loaded down with blankets. \u201CWe\u2019re\
  \ going to watch the sunrise. Join us?\u201D \n\nIt\u2019s the coldest night of\
  \ my life. Pressed up against strangers for warmth, the pillow that has slipped\
  \ away from my head is covered in a delicate layer of frost. The cold on my bones\
  \ is cold. Not wanting to be left out, Amallale sneaks over to sit by our feet.\
  \ \n\nThe first sign of the sun isn\u2019t a flaming rouge or a glowing orange or\
  \ even a soft yellow; instead black turns to blue as the waters of the day flood\
  \ the plains of the desert. It does not storm or blaze; it ascends. The sunlight\
  \ dapples our skin: two kids from Mexico by way of Budapest, an American girl by\
  \ way of London, and a stolen camel from Mali, all on a blanket on the border of\
  \ the Sahara Desert, brimming with the radiance of a distant star. \n\nAmallale\
  \ bellows, ushering in the day. We all laugh. \n\nMaybe camels aren\u2019t so bad\
  \ after all."
