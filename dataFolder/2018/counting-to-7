Text: "Romania was not the first in my bucket list at all,but I had a spare long weekend\
  \ and a small budget. I booked a last minute flight to Bucharest and joined an organized\
  \ day trip to Transylvania with my sister. When we stopped in a typical restaurant\
  \ for lunch I met him. Tall, blond, blue eyes. I'm not into blonds,but I was attracted\
  \ by him by the very first moment. I pushed my sister to seat at the table with\
  \ him and other two people. Chit chatting we get to know them:a Danish and British\
  \ working in Paris and an Australian Taiwanese girl living in Madrid.Suddenly I\
  \ felt boring: an Italian living in Italy, so original! We spent the rest of the\
  \ day together and met with them later that night for a drink. Super cheap alcohol\
  \ helped the conversation. Strangers who share deep thoughts and beliefs, without\
  \ caring if they are being judged. That's the best part of a random trip,I suppose.\
  \ After three Mojitos we headed downtown, looking for a disco pub or something to\
  \ sweat off the tipsiness. During the walk,I started talking with the Danish guy\
  \ about my dream to become a travel writer and the school I am attending.I don't\
  \ know how but we ended up having a conversation about how all people you meet affect\
  \ you.\"Even parents.Parents damage you,even though they don't mean to\", he said.\
  \ I was surprised. What could have ever damaged such a big man? The first place\
  \ we went to, was too posh for me, but a perfect place for the British guy. I had\
  \ a sweater and sneakers,I felt in the wrong place.After a while I managed to bring\
  \ them in the bar next door:the Bordello Bar.A promise in the name.Gorgeous girls\
  \ were dancing in underwear,and everybody was chilling out and drinking beer.The\
  \ Danish came to me and told me \"I've heard you have a boyfriend,otherwise I would\
  \ have tried to kiss you\".I just stared at him without saying a word,and he started\
  \ to come closer. I took a step back and told him \"Growing up sucks\". Then I dragged\
  \ him into the dancing floor,and we started dancing with the others. A bit later,a\
  \ super famous Italian song translated into Romanian was playing. The guy grabbed\
  \ me and made me spin at the rhythm of Raffaella Carr\xE0 and then I noticed: he\
  \ only had two fingers on the right hand. At that very moment,\"Parents damage you\"\
  \ made sense to me. I kept dancing as nothing happened,as I didn't notice anything\
  \ and I could understand that he was grateful for that.He told me his deepest secret\
  \ without saying a word,he trusted me,and it's a shame I'll never see him again."
