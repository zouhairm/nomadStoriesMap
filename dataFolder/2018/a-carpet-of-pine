Text: "Yoshi looked up at me with both helplessness and resignation in his eyes. We\
  \ were squashed inside the back of a shared collectivo in the middle of the southern\
  \ Mexican highlands.\n\nWhat was a short Japanese man in sandals, ripped jeans and\
  \ a punk t-shirt doing perched on my lap? The kids behind us let out a fit of giggles.\
  \ There was nowhere else to sit. \n\nJust before Lent in late February, the Kinta\
  \ Jimultik festival takes place in the Tzotzil town of San Juan Chamula, Chiapas.\
  \ Inspired by sacred rituals of the ancient Maya, the festival brings God\u2019\
  s blessing for the new agricultural cycle. \n\nYoshi and I were determined to see\
  \ it, lured by the promise of music and colour.\n\nAgainst the thundering of drums\
  \ in the main square, we found ourselves standing amid a riot of celebration. \n\
  \nWomen in purple tunics ran stalls selling textiles. Village elders in black and\
  \ red coats paraded through the streets in cone hats overflowing with ribbons. Others\
  \ stood proud in fluffy wool vests and the air filled with the cracking of fireworks.\
  \  \n\n\u201CDon\u2019t miss the church!\u201D Our host\u2019s voice rung in my\
  \ ears.\n\nI gestured to Yoshi, paid the entrance fee and moved towards it\u2019\
  s large teal doors. \n\nThough plain on the outside, the Church of San Juan Chamula\
  \ is by no means ordinary. Once inside, photography is strictly forbidden. \n\n\
  We emerged in the dark central hall to the earthy smell of copal. There were no\
  \ pews in sight - just people, a floor of pine needles and a sea of yellow candles.\
  \ Families sat before images of Catholic saints, praying and purifying each other\
  \ with eggs and live chickens. \n\nI was astonished. Was I really looking at descendants\
  \ of the ancient Maya?\n\nAs it turns out - yes! The Tzozil are one of many communities\
  \ in Mexico and Central America who are direct descendants of the Maya. \n\nChamula\
  \ is a truly unique blend of Catholicism, imposed during the Spanish colonisation\
  \ of the Americas, and Mayan tradition. Survivors of a difficult past who still\
  \ face growing community tensions concerning religion and identity. \n \nAs we left\
  \ the church, a young boy offered me a can of soft drink: burping expels bad spirits.\
  \ I had to smile.\n\nThinking of the farms and small homes we passed on the way\
  \ into town, I questioned what might happen to these indigenous communities as Mexico\
  \ develops.\n\nWill they retain their rights to autonomy and self-determination?\
  \ Will they solve their differences?\n\nOr is this our last chance to catch a rare\
  \ glimpse before they vanish forever?"
