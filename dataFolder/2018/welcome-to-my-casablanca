Text: "It was April 2017, just last year when my friend and I were sitting up in her\
  \ kitchen, browsing the internet for whatever you can find at 4 a.m. I tend to be\
  \  savvy at travel deals so was scouring the internet for flights. Within the hour,\
  \ we ended up booking a flight to Spain with a 17 hour layover in Casablanca, Morocco\
  \ for a little over 400 bucks. How could we pass it up? We left home in just four\
  \ days.\n\nWe did not know much about Morocco, but figured we could find some bar\
  \ or club to waste away in during the layover, then just head back to the airport\
  \ and sleep it off before the flight, but we soon learned that was not the case\
  \ in Morocco.\n\nWe got in to Mohamed V International pretty late, my friend's belongings\
  \ were lost, and there was no internet to figure out anything, so we hopped on the\
  \ next train to what we believed was the city. \n\nWe went by two or three train\
  \ stops just waiting to see a little bit of light or nightlife out the window, and\
  \ when we finally did we hopped off and went wandering. It was about 11 o'clock\
  \ and the center of \"Casa\" was still lit with life. As we wandered, we ended up\
  \ at a street bizarre and began to shop around and look for a bar. \n\nThis plan\
  \ was going well, until we were surrounded by a group of people.circled. My friend\
  \ and I were back to back and being harassed. That is when our new found forever\
  \ friends, \"the Rasta men of Morocco\" found us and scared them off. The two men\
  \ told us to stick with them for the rest of the night and they would take us back\
  \ to the train at 7 a.m. We trusted our intuition and went with them. \n\nWhen we\
  \ explained our situation, they were more than excited that we \"chose Morocco\"\
  \ and wanted to show us everything their city had to offer in the middle of the\
  \ night. We followed them to the Old Medina which is a beautiful section of bizarres\
  \ with painted walls and sandy floors, they took us to the beach, and then we found\
  \ ourselves posted in a cafe. That is when the men began to tell us their story-\
  \ how they were kicked out of school and fired from their jobs because they followed\
  \ the \"Rasta\" way. We sat out with them all night and heard their stories. They\
  \ taught us about Islam and how people fail to perceive it as a good thing. We talked\
  \ about everything- dreams, hopes, lives. It was beautiful.\n\nAfter this, we proceeded\
  \ back to catch our train and on the way, continued to chat. We exchanged contacts\
  \ and still write letters. They remain some of the most beautiful people I know."
