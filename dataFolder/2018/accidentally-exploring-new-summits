Text: "When I think back to the summer 2 years ago I always get excited and catch\
  \ a glimpse of that adventurous soul I actually possess which nevertheless gets\
  \ hidden in everyday life. From time to time it suddenly bursts out and I find myself\
  \ in complete new situations in foreign countries.\n As a human being making experiences\
  \ is important and makes you expand the summits of your mind. Hitchhiking trough\
  \ 5 european countries with my boyfriend held an enormous amount of experiences.\
  \ When arriving in Riva del Garda, a very touristic place in Italy we could already\
  \ see the surroundings were sprinkled with summits. But what we came here for wasn\u2019\
  t a touristic experience we payed for in advance as many people we passed by on\
  \ the streets surely did. \nI was lucky enough to know a local who took us to the\
  \ fantastic Ville del Monte. After a seemingly short car ride we arrived and climbed\
  \ rustic stairs. The small village we entered now looked swept clean and we neither\
  \ met touristic crowds nor did we see inhabitants.  The medieval village gave me\
  \ a very familiar and domestic feeling deep down. Narrow streets swung around sand-coloured\
  \ houses which seemed to have suspended in time. The air was incredibly fresh and\
  \ I could barely hear any noise. A calming peaceful atmosphere lay upon this isolated\
  \ part of the countryside. \nWe passed by labyrinthine paths until we reached a\
  \ stunningly turquoise lake. My boyfriend took the opportunity to dive into the\
  \ incredible mountain lake,\nAfter he got out we flipped stones on the clear water\
  \ surface, which at that time began to sprinkle with hardly noticeable drops of\
  \ rainwater. The typical contest of whose stone counts the most jumps went on for\
  \ a while.\nSuddenly I felt an intense pain at the back of my head which for a second\
  \ spread all over my pate. At first I didn\u2019t realise where this pain came from.\
  \ There was just an echo of the thump, rising and falling in unsteady intervals.\
  \ My boyfriend had accidentally thrown into the wrong direction. Passing out wasn\u2019\
  t an opportunity so I expanded different summits of my mind and stayed strong."
