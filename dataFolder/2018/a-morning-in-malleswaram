Text: "The auto rickshaw hurtled through the streets of Bangalore. I had just flown\
  \ in the previous night and I was in Malleswaram, the older part of the city, to\
  \ pick up garlands for the puja celebrations.\nSuddenly, the driver brought the\
  \ rickshaw to a screeching halt and I lurched forward.\n\u2018What is happening?\u2019\
  \nHe didn\u2019t answer and I stepped out of the auto to see for myself.\nA procession\
  \ was coming down the other way and we could go no further till it passed.\nMen\
  \ and women in brightly coloured garments were dancing along the road. Some were\
  \ beating drums slung around their necks, while others were holding copper plates\
  \ with sweets and fruits on them. Crackers were burst and in the centre of it all\
  \ was the Goddess Durga being carried on a platform. The many armed Goddess was\
  \ resplendent in a red and gold saree and a gold crown with glittering stones. She\
  \ held a spear and the Buffalo Demon Mahishasura lay dying at her feet. \nAs I stood\
  \ there my gaze fell upon a young woman squatting by the gate of a house. She was\
  \ placing rows of dots on the ground with white rice flour powder from a steel bowl.\
  \ Using her thumb and index finger she drew steady, even lines around the arrangement\
  \ of dots and an intricate pattern began to emerge. With smooth, graceful movements\
  \ she created an elaborate design.\nShe then used coloured powders and petals of\
  \ flowers, to create a vibrant explosion of colour. She was completely absorbed\
  \ in the Mandala or Kolam as it is called, and seemed oblivious to the noise and\
  \ hustle around her. Calm, centred, and one with the task at hand.\nIn a short while\
  \ we were on our way again.\nWe reached the market. Women were sitting on either\
  \ side of the street with large baskets of flowers in front of them. I rushed past\
  \ them ignoring their pleas.\nI found the stall I was looking for near a Ganesha\
  \ temple. The owner peered at the receipt and said, \n\u2018It will take some time\
  \ \u2013 not ready yet.\u2019\n\u2018It was supposed to be ready by 8.\u2019 I cried.\n\
  \u2018Only 8.30 no. You have best coffee. Karthik get filter coffee.\u2019\nI normally\
  \ would have reprimanded him sharply but the sense of peace I had felt while watching\
  \ the girl drawing patterns on the earth still remained with me. I quietly accepted\
  \ the tumbler of steaming coffee but I froze before I could take my first sip. The\
  \ girl who had made the Kolam was in the bazaar. She was some distance away but\
  \ I could clearly make out the careful way she was moving, and the white cane which\
  \ she used to tap her way forward."
