Text: "When our train pulled into Roma Termini and we stepped out into the street,\
  \ I could almost hear the cartoonish sound of vinyl scratching. Trash piled on the\
  \ sidewalk and vendors roamed the crowds, waiting to shove a miniature model of\
  \ the Pantheon in your face. We checked into our grimy hostel, wondering where our\
  \ beloved Italy had gone. Exhausted and disenchanted, we set out towards the city\
  \ center, side-stepping crowds and avoiding brochure-wavers. All I could think about\
  \ was getting on the train back to Florence. But as we rounded a corner, everything\
  \ fell into place. \nThe Colosseum stood against the evening sky, unfazed by the\
  \ spectators that stared up in awe. The centuries-old stone was lit up in gold,\
  \ a gateway to the real Rome. The further we walked, the less we pictured going\
  \ back to grimy outskirts. So, two hours later, we rolled our bags into a refuge\
  \ for women travelers, just across from the Centro Storico. Despite being run by\
  \ old hens who eyed us suspiciously when we dragged in the smell of wine and youth,\
  \ it was close to the main sights and a vibrant nightlife. \nThe essence of Rome\
  \ revealed itself to us at every opportunity. It was present in the elderly ladies\
  \ in heels and fur coats and in the nonchalant drivers that failed time and again\
  \ to stay in their lane. It was impossible to ignore in the local market that saved\
  \ us from starvation one afternoon. \nColored tents stood around a small piazza\
  \ filled with bustling vendors and passersby. The smell of baking bread and caldarroste\
  \ drifted through the air, arsenals of fruits and vegetables lined the stalls. Sausages\
  \ dangled from strings and sampling trays of delicacies served as bait for the weak-willed.\
  \ As my eyes landed on the jars of truffle oil and the cheese platter, I knew I\
  \ didn\u2019t stand a chance. The vendor acted quickly, launching into a gastronomical\
  \ soliloquy with gestured descriptions of olio al tartufo, pomodoro secchi, and\
  \ pesto rosso. \n\u201CYou want to try, signorinas?\u201D he inquired in an accent\
  \ as thick as the truffle oil on display. I thought he would never ask. \nAll of\
  \ Rome is as rich as that first, unforgettable bite. Ever since I left, I can\u2019\
  t help but crave another taste. I miss getting lost but feeling found in streets\
  \ that have a pulse. I miss trading words with Italian men over pizza and wine.\
  \ Most of all, I miss flopping onto the bed after scattering 31,000 steps over an\
  \ interminable city, knowing I was living with no hesitations and that for the first\
  \ time, I felt at home."
