Text: "\u201CHello, ma\u2019am! Hello ma\u2019am!\u201D You tap insistently on the\
  \ cab window and put your tiny hand to your mouth to show me you\u2019re hungry.\
  \ You look about four, but I bet you\u2019re older. \n\nWe\u2019re surrounded by\
  \ a maze of vehicles: three-wheeled green and yellow tuk-tuks compete for space\
  \ with brightly painted diesel trucks that cough fumes. A Brahmin cow wearing garlands\
  \ of orange flowers wanders through. I worry for your fragile life as you try to\
  \ keep body and soul joined in this crazy quilt of Mumbai traffic. \n\nMy fear is\
  \ strengthened by reading the daily newspaper with its full-page spread of photographs\
  \ of unidentified dead bodies. I envision a picture of a small, crumpled child with\
  \ an ad asking readers if they recognize you. They\u2019ve guessed your age and\
  \ state where you were found.\n\nBut today, that\u2019s not you, and I put my hand\
  \ on the glass window, covering your smaller one on the other side. A pane of glass\
  \ is all that divides my privilege from your vulnerability. You puncture my heart,\
  \ but I\u2019ve been warned repeatedly I shouldn\u2019t give food or money because\
  \ it doesn\u2019t go to you. It goes to someone else and you\u2019re just a pawn.\n\
  \ \nI\u2019ve been told the poor are happy - just never by the poor. It\u2019s tempting\
  \ to stare straight ahead and pretend you\u2019re not there, but I can\u2019t. Having\
  \ your face inches from mine makes you real. I don\u2019t need to understand Marathi\
  \ to know you\u2019re pleading with me. \n\n\u201CWhat\u2019s your name?\u201D I\
  \ ask, and my colleague interprets. I don\u2019t remember what it was, but I regret\
  \ I didn\u2019t tell you it was a beautiful name for a beautiful girl. Instead,\
  \ I tell you I wish circumstances in India will change and you will have a chance\
  \ for a different future. A future with more options than being a master dodger\
  \ and weaver of traffic and learning to survive the underbelly of life. \n\nI wonder\
  \ where you sleep, and if you\u2019ll ever have the chance to go to school. You\u2019\
  ve learned lessons by four that most people don\u2019t learn until much later. And\
  \ I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve learned some lessons we both wish you didn\u2019t have\
  \ to learn at all. \n\nIt\u2019s easier to ignore India\u2019s problems. There are\
  \ more comfortable experiences on offer: browsing and bargaining in the markets\
  \ or sampling curry, dahl and naan with a cup of masala chai. \n\nThe red light\
  \ turns green and my air-conditioned cab \u2014 that shields me from the heat and\
  \ your unwashed face and skinny limbs \u2014 re-enters the chaos of a thousand honking\
  \ horns. You turn and sprint back to the median."
