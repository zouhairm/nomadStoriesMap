Text: "I froze. They had me surrounded. Fear had taken over my body like they had\
  \ taken over his country. I moved to kill the spiders that had made their way past\
  \ my knees, but it was too late. Kokos was shaking his head.\n\nThe Swiss country\
  \ side was crowded with creatures of my dislike. Kokos gestured for me to sit. I\
  \ would not sit. Instinctively, I turned away.\n\n\u201CNo,\u201D he said firmly.\
  \ \u201CSit.\u201D\n\nThat was the first time I had heard him speak; he knew nothing\
  \ of English. He pursed his lips as he hummed. His fingers tapped the table with\
  \ every pause in his voice; carefully, he avoided anything viable. His dread locks\
  \ swayed with the wind as he danced his head to the beat of his own song.\n\nI asked\
  \ what song he was humming- he stood up and signaled me to follow. The path was\
  \ outlined with idyllic flowerbeds that stretched as far as my alpine view.\n\n\
  The dusty inside of his country home was unlike anything I had imagined. The walls\
  \ were painted a brilliant shade of yellow, which distracted from the absence of\
  \ material objects. He shifted my gaze to the flag that hung above the turn table;\
  \ it was the flag for The Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n\nWhen Kokos placed\
  \ his headphones over my ears and told me to close my eyes, I learned that he was\
  \ not always a free man. The music began to play and I could feel the pain that\
  \ he had felt, I could see his tired body giving into the disrespect around him.\
  \ Kokos left his country in 1988, but it wasn\u2019t until his arrival in Switzerland\
  \ that he found the respects for human rights that he desired.\n\nI opened my eyes\
  \ when I felt the itch of a spider running down my leg. Again, I went to kill it.\
  \ This time Kokos stopped me by reaching for my hand- he shook his head. He stepped\
  \ closer to me and removed the spider from my leg.\n\n\u201CFree.\u201D He said,\
  \ his tone empathetic. He placed my hands in his- they were calloused yet gentle.\
  \ He watched as the spider crawled from the tip of his middle finger onto the creases\
  \ of my palm.\n\nFor a second, I lost my composure. However, after seeing his shoulders\
  \ rise and fall with every breath he drew in, I took in a deep breath of my own.\
  \ Immediately, I could smell an almost pleasant scent of pollen, I could feel the\
  \ sun against my skin and the breeze moving the grass between my toes. \n\nI smiled\
  \ at Kokos; he smiled back. Only now did I understand that fear does not allow freedom.\
  \ I knew all along that I had been free, but I was now realizing the equivalence\
  \ to that of which Kokos had gained.\n\n\u201CFree.\u201D He repeated"
