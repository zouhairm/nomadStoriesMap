Text: 'My story begins with a fly rod, a little love, some saltwater and the discovery
  of my grace. You see, not many people understand what it means to travel the country
  fishing as a female. And now as a published writer and author on the subject, it
  has encouraged me to continue on this path of my writing life. However, most folks
  also don''t understand the true excitement that comes with seeing a fish the size
  of your leg. So for me, I always go back, search for that grace, walk miles and
  miles for the chance to catch that glory, but none of these things are the reason
  I keep going back for more.


  As a child, I was given a fly rod at the tender age of 5 years old. And even though
  I never understood this grace until in my 30''s, it has changed me, given me the
  chance to guide and teach people from all over the world about this beautiful gift.
  Bleeding fingers, bug spray that never leaves your nose, sunburns, windburns, ant
  bites and so much more. But the smile on my face, the smile my has taken and that
  my souls sings to the world, is absolutely worth it.


  So if you''re interested in learning more about what I do, what I write and the
  love that this beautiful gift has given me, come join me in my fly gal adventures.'
