Text: "Stone beds, swallowing small live octopi, and being served kimchi for three\
  \ meals each day were just some of the surprises of being immersed in Korean culture.\
  \  Almost every day, I was challenged  or given a new perspective.  \n\nOne such\
  \ new experience occurred after a day of shopping in Daegu, South Korea.   I was\
  \ on a bus to return to HaYang with a bag full of groceries.  Typically,  when I\
  \ was out and about,  I carried my purse in my shopping bag, but it had been displaced\
  \ by the groceries so it became a second parcel that afternoon. On the bus journey,\
  \ I engaged in a conversation with a friend on the bus and got distracted.  As I\
  \ glanced out the bus\u2019s window, I noticed that I had reached my stop.  I hurriedly\
  \ grabbed my bag, said good-bye to my friend, and scurried out the door.  The bus\
  \ pulled away, just as I noticed that I had left my purse on the bus.  Panic set\
  \ in.  Although my ID card and credit card were in my pocket, the purse contained\
  \ other valuables.   What to do?\n\nMy first reaction was to run.   I ran after\
  \ the bus, thinking maybe, just maybe, I could catch up to it if it stopped in the\
  \ next block or two.  But, as I hurried, the distance between me and the bus just\
  \ increased until the bus and hopes of retrieving my purse were out of sight.  What\
  \ to do?\n\nSince I do not speak nor read Korean, I was unsure how to contact the\
  \ bus company or how to contact the local police.  But, I knew that some English\
  \ speakers hung out at a local coffee shop, so I proceeded to find them to assist\
  \ me and help me solve this problem. \n\nAs I walked toward the coffee shop, exhausted,\
  \ frustrated with myself, and worried, two adolescent Korean males approached me.\
  \  They spoke in halting English and said: \u201Cbag\u201D.  They opened their shopping\
  \ bag and there was my purse. What a relief! They gave me my purse, intact, and\
  \ left.  I was so shocked that I didn\u2019t even think to offer them a reward.\
  \ Obviously, they had noticed the purse on the bus seat and had elected to do the\
  \ honorable thing: exit the bus, seek me out, and return the purse.    Since there\
  \ was only a handful or two of Americans in this community  of 10,000, they had\
  \ no trouble locating me.  What a wonderful, unexpected random act of kindness!\
  \  Later I was informed that this is not such an unusual act in Korea.  A friend\
  \ reported that he had lost his cell phone several times and it had always been\
  \ returned to him.  I lost my purse but I found hope in the renewed sense of goodness\
  \ of strangers in a foreign land."
