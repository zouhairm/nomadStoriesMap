Text: "Is that urine or water?  I stepped daintily over the cracked pavement, careful\
  \ to avoid the murky puddles littered along the alley. I\u2019ve always been vigilant\
  \ when avoiding mysterious street water, even back home in Vancouver, but today\
  \ we were far from Canadian streets.\n\nWe were navigating, albeit unsuccessfully,\
  \ out of the historical city of Intramuros which is nestled near the coast of Manila\
  \ Bay. The five hundred year old city has been steeped in colonialism and war, destroyed\
  \ and rebuilt by Spaniards, Americans, and Japanese occupiers. Today, the resilient\
  \ stonewalls embrace the beautiful San Agustin Church and its wise, aged buildings;\
  \ a maze for travellers like us. \n\nTwo story homes watched as we wandered down\
  \ a residential alley, stray dogs crossing our paths. I glanced at my fellow travellers:\
  \ my brother and three others we met during breakfast at the hostel. Their open\
  \ toed sandals strode precariously near the grey pools. My stomach turned uneasily.\n\
  \n\u201CWhat\u2019s that?\u201D \n\nI looked. We were approaching a buzzing crowd\
  \ of Filipino children. Their sun infused skin and malnourished limbs looked consistent\
  \ with the beggars we met in the city square. Locals had told us to ignore them,\
  \ even if it broke our hearts, since handing money to one meant relentless pleas\
  \ from more. This time, however, we were met with excited bright eyes and toothless\
  \ grins. Small hands reached out to ours, and the sound of Tagalog, broken English,\
  \ and music filled the air. Wait, music?\n\nUnder an awning sat a five-foot hunk\
  \ of metal. Pink and blue paint peeled from its sides and the aluminum corroded\
  \ around its body. The yellowed glass face in its rounded head glowed faintly in\
  \ the daylight. A young boy sang vigorously into the microphone cabled to it.\n\n\
  \u201CSing now, sing now!\u201D \n\nThey dragged us to their makeshift karaoke bar,\
  \ cleared the youngest children off the bench, and demanded we sit. A black binder\
  \ with worn white pages was shoved at my brother. He dutifully accepted it, memories\
  \ of his high school boy band sparking behind his eyes.\n\nCheers erupted as he\
  \ sang a tune from The Backstreet Boys, his voice a low tenor that never quite matched\
  \ his favourite songs. Joy emulated from each child, lighthouses of bliss in a sea\
  \ of scarcity. No one smiled this bright back home, where the rain and responsibilities\
  \ made them retreat into their thousand dollar smartphones. Surrounded by poverty,\
  \ urine filled potholes, and a babysitting karaoke machine, these children were,\
  \ surprisingly, happy."
