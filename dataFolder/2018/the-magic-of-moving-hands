Text: "It was a serendipitous encounter, on a tiny island of Koh Tao in Thailand,\
  \ popular with tourists and locals. Our first meeting took place on the port in\
  \ the morning, the wind warm and breezy, the sea with halcyon waves, and tourists\
  \ thronged around us, chittering away with their voices, akin to an incomprehensible\
  \ white noise.\n\nThe four young Thais, in their early 20\u2019s, were moving their\
  \ hands into various shapes; the wrists bent downward and rotated upwards, the pinky\
  \ upright while other fingers were bent towards the palm, and the palms brushing\
  \ the back of the hand. Their facial expressions show a range of emotions from joy\
  \ to disgust. Their eyebrows would move up and down in a synchronized movement with\
  \ the handshapes they were making. The eyes gleaming with a hint of a spark, revealing\
  \ their owners\u2019 thoughts. The young Thais\u2019 faces were an open book of\
  \ expressive emotions and thoughts that could draw attention from anyone passing\
  \ by. \n\nThey were unintelligible to me, a deaf person fluent in American Sign\
  \ Language. I couldn\u2019t understand what they were telling each other in Thai\
  \ Sign Language. However, it was a wonderful, comforting sight to behold. It inspired\
  \ a sense of familiarity and home in a tropical setting thousands of miles away\
  \ from our home. \n\nAt the Koh Tao port after we disembarked from the boat, we\
  \ immediately saw and \u201Crecognized\u201D each other: The only deaf in a sea\
  \ of walking and talking hearing people. \n\nOur eyes met and gave each other a\
  \ silent acknowledgement. I mustered up courage to walk to them and introduce myself.\
  \ I pointed to myself and moved my index finger from my right ear to my mouth: \u201C\
  Deaf.\u201D Then, I pointed to all of them, moved my eyebrows up, and signed \u201C\
  Deaf\u201D again: \u201CYou all are deaf?\u201D They nodded their heads at my display\
  \ of the universal sign for \u201Cdeaf.\u201D\n\nThey introduced themselves as Aroon,\
  \ Sakda, Lawan, and Sopa. I attempted to form a sentence in sign language to ask\
  \ them about the number of deaf people on the island. It wasn\u2019t ASL or Thai\
  \ Sign Language, but a mix of gestures, facial expressions, body language, and miming,\
  \ along with a sprinkling of ASL signs in between. It was like our hands would paint\
  \ various scenes in the air with our hands to convey our thoughts and questions.\
  \ \n\nIn these moments, I found a \u201Ccultural kinship\u201D with them, my deaf\
  \ Thai counterparts. Despite our background and language differences, we were able\
  \ to find a way to communicate. It must be the magic of sign language, after all."
