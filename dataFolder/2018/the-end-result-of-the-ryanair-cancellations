Text: "I was backpacking around Europe when I caught wind of the Ryanair news. Dozens\
  \ of flights had been cancelled with little notice. Scrolling through the list,\
  \ I stumbled across my final flight back home. I managed to arrange another flight\
  \ after much stress. When I got home, I discovered Ryanair had given me a \xA340\
  \ flight voucher as compensation. It turns out a return flight to Krakow in January\
  \ was \xA340. Without thinking much, I booked it; a free holiday, what\u2019s there\
  \ to think about. The hostel was less than \xA320 for 4 nights, it was looking like\
  \ the cheapest holiday of my life. What I didn\u2019t know is that it was also going\
  \ to be the most enriching.\n\nFast forward a few months and I\u2019m stood looking\
  \ up at the gates leadings into Auschwitz concentration camp. It was hard to believe\
  \ this would have been one of the last sights for millions as they were led to their\
  \ deaths. I meandered round the camp noting how piercing the cold was. I was chilled\
  \ to the bone and I was wearing multiple layers. Inside one of the buildings there\
  \ were several glass cabinets. The first one had thousands of old, deteriorating\
  \ shoes piled high within it. There were tiny shoes in there, shoes that could only\
  \ fit a young child. The second cabinet held suitcases, demonstrating the hope these\
  \ people had, believing they were arriving here to start a new life. Names were\
  \ scrawled across the bags, lost identities.\n\nA third cabinet stretch from one\
  \ side of the room to the other. It was filled with human hair that had previously\
  \ belonged to 140,000 people. It was a truly disturbing sight, one that has been\
  \ ingrained in my memory. Finally, a group of us were taken underground and piled\
  \ into a dimly lit room. We were told we were standing in an old gas chamber. Years\
  \ before, hundreds of people at one time had been sent here, told they were going\
  \ for a shower and that afterwards they would receive hot soup. The doors would\
  \ have been slammed shut and pellets dropped down from the ceiling, releasing hydrogen\
  \ cyanide. Most people would die within 20 minutes. It was extremely emotional and\
  \ terrifying being stood in the exact place thousands of innocent people had died.\
  \ Imagining the screams, panic, children clinging to their mother's, was a significant\
  \ point in my life. Until this moment I had never truly understood the extent of\
  \ the horrors that had occurred in Europe during WW2. I feel it is so important\
  \ for everyone to visit Auschwitz once in their lives and never let this event be\
  \ forgotten."
