Text: "The brisk coastal air on my face seemed to refresh something deeper within\
  \ my being; an energy longing to be set free, stifled by the monotony of everyday\
  \ life in the Midwest. The sound of the waves crashing against the distant shoreline\
  \ pulsed through my body with the beat of my own heart.\n\nAhead it seemed only\
  \ a short distance to the horizon itself, as the stones and grass abruptly ended\
  \ and a misty blue sky began. Undaunted, I continued to climb, ready to meet the\
  \ edge of the earth if that's what was before me. I had spent most of my life amid\
  \ cornfields and warehouses, working the days away and merely dreaming of adventure\
  \ at night when the workday was done. Finally feeling my spirit crying out for more,\
  \ I embarked to backpack the Irish trails, to connect with my heritage and break\
  \ free from the dull routine. \n\nWe have but one life, and I was no longer going\
  \ to waste it.\n\nI had been following Burren Way since dawn, and my breath was\
  \ growing heavy with anticipation as I neared the edge of the Cliffs of Moher. My\
  \ belly was still full from the hearty breakfast Noreen had cooked for me at her\
  \ inn outside of St. Brigid's Well; a traditional platter of eggs, bacon, sausage,\
  \ fried tomatoes and potatoes, baked beans...more than I could comfortably eat.\
  \ I had wished her many thanks, took my pack, and continued on my way.\n\nGravel\
  \ crunched under my feet and the ocean mist kissed my face in the breeze. The sound\
  \ of the gulls almost invited me to the edge, encouraging my climb. There were many\
  \ sounds to be heard along the coastline - waves on the rocks, the wind chasing\
  \ through the grass, birds singing their songs - yet it seemed so...quiet. Away\
  \ from the noise of engines and asphalt, the sounds of nature were like a living\
  \ silence, calming my frustrated soul.\n\nThe few final steps brought a rush through\
  \ my body, a tightness in my chest, like my spirit longing to burst free and soar\
  \ with the gulls overheard. At last I crested the hillside...and lost my breath.\
  \ I was unprepared for what met my eyes and soul.\n\nAt the edge of the cliffs,\
  \ the coastal waves suddenly roared below me, no longer muffled by the rocky ground.\
  \ The vast expanse of the sea, stretching beyond the reach of my vision, left me\
  \ feeling as small as the pebbles below my feet. It was the most awe-inspiring,\
  \ soul-quenching moment of my life. Never before had I felt how small we really\
  \ are, and how beautiful this world is we take for granted.\n\nI breathed deep the\
  \ salty air, and smiled. My journey was only beginning."
