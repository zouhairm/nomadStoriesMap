Text: "Nobody expected so much would happen in three weeks while visiting Patrick\
  \ at Guatemala.It was more than emotional.Than we met Carl.He asked us to do the\
  \ Acatenango Vulcano-Tour with him.We started the tour at Antigua which changed\
  \ my way of thinking overall.The first steps of the 3600 altitude meters to our\
  \ campsite I thought I am gonna die. It was so steep but I knew I must go on.That\
  \ was my test. My test reaching the outest edges of my power.The climb took over\
  \ five hours.As we reached our campsite,I sat on the edge of our campsite writing\
  \ about death and what kind of feelings I had during the climb to my diary.My diary\
  \ is about my feelings and thoughts and life changing moments. I have already started\
  \ to write the first pages making a book out of it.The first pages of my own book.And\
  \ one time I can give my own written book to people read about my inner journey\
  \ to my inner peace.And this tour was getting more breathtaking as it already was\
  \  sitting in front of the vulcano Fuego watching it while seeing the dust coming\
  \ out of this impressive,majestetic object built by nature. We were already really\
  \ tired and powerless but than our guide asked us if we want to see the sunset on\
  \ the very top of Acatenango.Everything was painful already,but could we miss this?No!So,\
  \ we went up again for another 45 minute walk to the top.After half an hour my power\
  \ was less than zero. The scenery was already more than we have ever expected from\
  \ the tour.Surrounded by allover amazing views.We decided to stay at the point to\
  \ see the scenery and be thankful for reaching that high.But another guy from our\
  \ group told us:\"You CAN`T stop!Come on!It\xB4s not about the sunset! It\xB4s about\
  \ the eruption of Fuego!\" We couldn\xB4t stay there.I don\xB4t know where the power\
  \ came from but now it was time to really use the rests of the rests where no rests\
  \ have been to that point of moment.The hardest 15 minutes steep walk.I was close\
  \ to just lay down,never stand up again.The muscles were were like melted butter.The\
  \ Last steps to the top.We did it!And there I just let myself fall to the ground.Gratitude\
  \ to my body and my mind.Now we stood close to the crate surrounded by stars,a surreal\
  \ looking atmosphere.Both we were crying. Never been so close to the stars except\
  \ while sitting on an airplane.We sat down, breath the freezing cold air.I saw red\
  \ dust slowly coming up the Fuego,telling us that we soon will see the most breathtaking\
  \ moment we have ever had in our life. The cosmic eruption."
