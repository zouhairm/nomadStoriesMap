Text: "It was four hours into a thirteen hour bus ride from Brussels to Prague that\
  \ a man sat next to me. I\u2019d anticipated this. The bus had been gradually filling\
  \ up, stop by stop. I removed my headphones as we stopped and waited. \n \nThe man\
  \ that sat next to me immediately pulled out his own headphones but instead of plugging\
  \ them straight into his ears, he waited. It was now or never.\n \n\u201CEnglish?\u201D\
  \ I spat out before my brain could control my mouth.\n \nHe smiled, \u201CYes.\u201D\
  \ \n \n\u201CFantastic!\u201D \n \nWe started with introductions, something I rarely\
  \ do these days. I stumbled over the words that represent me: Kiwi, British, Hungarian,\
  \ university student, English and History major, writes, reads, runs. His were more\
  \ eloquent; recent graduate, finance, spent the last three months on a farm in Scotland\
  \ picking strawberries, lost but heading home. \n \nHome turned out to be Brno,\
  \ a two and a half hour train ride from Prague. \n \n\u201CWhat\u2019s it like?\u201D\
  \n\nThe next hour, or two, was filled with vivid descriptions of the past. His history.\
  \ What it was like growing up in the then newly formed Czech Republic. My speciality,\
  \ or rather the thing I am most interested in, is nationhood and nationality. \n\
  \nThen, as we neared the present, I asked after his cities\u2014Prague and Brno\u2014\
  what were they like? What should I go see? What should I eat? What did he miss,\
  \ being away for three months? I shared in kind, about New Zealand, where he should\
  \ go should he visit. What to avoid (New Zealand is rather touristy, as our economy\
  \ is largely driven by tourism) and where to absolutely visit. \n\nWe laughed at\
  \ the two bus drivers\u2019 banter\u2014he translated along the way\u2014and at\
  \ their brisk tone when announcing the next stop in a multitude of languages. \n\
  \nIt was nearing three in the morning when we decided it was time for a snooze.\
  \ We\u2019d be arriving, bleary eyed, to a crisp 6am. In the height of summer, the\
  \ fifteen degrees the temperature had sunk to felt arctic. \n\nI awoke as we rolled\
  \ into Prague, crossing the river Vltava. It was hard not to smile, throat dry from\
  \ talking all night, and eyes swollen with sleep. I could tell from the taste in\
  \ the air that the bus air likely smelled funny. \n\nNow both awake, I was quickly\
  \ told, once more, where to go and what to see, and that, should I visit Brno, I\
  \ had a place to sleep. I ran through the few Czech words I\u2019d perfected with\
  \ him, and we exchanged emails with a promise to stay in touch. \n\nThree days later\
  \ I was in Brno with my local connection. \n\nAhoj!"
