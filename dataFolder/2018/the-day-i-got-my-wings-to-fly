Text: "I am a fashion Photographer by profession and this was during my college day,I\
  \ started my career early as a freelance photographer accompanied by a small business\
  \ with my boyfriend. But Even though I was pursuing my desired career hiding from\
  \ my family when they were expecting me to have good  grades and followed by a good\
  \ job.I had the dream of being a solo traveler and yes that was the reason i was\
  \ working during college days to save some money and explore. I end up sharing my\
  \ thoughts with my boyfriend come business partner and to my surprise when I shared\
  \ him my dreams, this time it was not the family but the person i loved who turned\
  \ against and eventually forced me to stop pursuing my dream. Well I believe you\
  \ can only love one thing at a time and yes as I say travelling is not my passion,it\
  \ is my love and nothing in this world can stop me from pursuing what i love.The\
  \ First journey will always be memorable since it was the reason for my  beak up\
  \  of a long term relationship and added to that running away from home for the\
  \ first time was an absolute different feeling. It was Feb  29 2016, leap year,\
  \ I packed my bag and set off for the journey.I took a train from Sealdah (Kolkata)\
  \ to New Jalpaiguri.It was an overnight journey on a second class train but the\
  \ feeling of being free finally didn\u2019t bothered me with the uncomfortable journey.At\
  \ 7:30am the train dropped me at the New Jalpaiguri station. I had two options-\
  \ Darjeeling or Natula Pass and i actually flipped a coin and end up reaching Gangtok.\
  \ It took me 3.5hrs to reach Gangtok. My journey was accompanied by Tista river\
  \ flowing beside the entire route,the divine mounting air and the mesmerizing nature.That\
  \ day after reaching Gangtok I took  rest fo the day and stroll around the nearby\
  \ area in the evening.The next day early morning I booked a shared taxi for Nathla\
  \ Pass and Zero point.Unfortunately Nathul pass was closed due to heavy snow fall\
  \ and i end up to zero point \"Baba Harbhajan Singh Mandir'. That was the last Destination\
  \ before INDO CHINA Border. At the peak the view was breath taking, the snow clad\
  \ mountains, the serenity in the air as if nature was speaking to me. I sat there\
  \ for an hour filling up my mind, heart and soul with the  divine experience that\
  \ would last life long. I was a complete different person coming back from the journey&never\
  \ looked back, like a selfish human being I choose to live a life for myself and\
  \ pursue my dreams, my love for being solo and travel the world."
