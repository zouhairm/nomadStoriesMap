Text: "The decision that pushed me to the edge was actually deciding to write this\
  \ story.\nIn the last two times I left Portugal, I went to Paris, in 2014, and Seville,\
  \ in 2015. \nMy country is absolutely breath taking. I live near Sintra - an old\
  \ and historical village - and as much as I go there, I don't think I'll ever get\
  \ enough. I know it as the palm of my hand, there is no palace or castle that I\
  \ haven't been at and even after that, there is so much more. I believe that Sintra\
  \ is a place - and a beautiful one - but it's also a feeling. When somewhere captures\
  \ your soul, it stops being just a \"place\", it's now part of who you are. I can\
  \ say the same about Lisbon - the capital of Portugal - and Algarve - more specifically\
  \ Manta Rota, where I go every summer with my family, located on the south of Portugal.\
  \ Lisbon is the city of - and for - artists. They are in every single street, either\
  \ painting, being a \"human statue\" or dancing, there is no way to not be constantly\
  \ inspired. On the other side, Manta Rota brings inner peace and it's a really quiet\
  \ zone, not all places in Algarve are like this, some are more \"touristic\", for\
  \ example, Portim\xE3o . The feeling Manta Rota gives me is - now - a bitter sweet\
  \ one, much like Paris, it reminds me of my grandmother, who passed way in 2014.\
  \ \nIt's funny how the human mind works, it can take us to places of the past and\
  \ also to other ones we've never been at. It's a peculiar feeling to miss something\
  \ you never experienced. When I was little, my father told me a lot of stories about\
  \ his time in Gorongoza, Mozambique. How he and his parents were chased by elephants\
  \ while going on a safari. I've never been there but, oh, how I miss it. \nI miss\
  \ all the things I have never done and I make my mission to accomplish it \u2013\
  \ whatever it is \u2013 and actually have reasons to keep missing it."
