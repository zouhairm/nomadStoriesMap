Text: "Chanting religious chorus verse, with continuous holy water dripping sound,\
  \ attracted tourists towards that broom. With tourist\u2019s discretion, he smashed\
  \ those broomsticks onto her head. He had orange dhoti wrapped around that naked\
  \ body making a clear contrast to his skin color. Intrigued with this ritual made\
  \ me reminisce as the broom looked similar to one which mother used to clean floor.\
  \ The place was crowded with a horde of people rushing to see that one golden idol\
  \ that stood 10ft tall. Teachings of Buddha were indelibly inherited in my papa\u2019\
  s prudent system. Providing solace to his soul, he muttered those words which were\
  \ the last thing I expected as Sanskrit became a medium for performing religious\
  \ deity.\n\n''\u092C\u0941\u0926\u094D\u0927\u0902 \u0936\u0930\u0923\u0902 \u0917\

  (I go to the Sangha for refuge)\n\nAs an atheist, I choose to ignore those uttered\
  \ words and never dared to perceive its meaning. The city of Bangkok was an amalgam\
  \ of culture, people which helps to bring its utopia to its true state. Taking the\
  \ advantage of the geographical location it becomes a hot spot for tourist attraction\
  \ during winter. \nThe city is popular for woman as well as man\u2019s lust for\
  \ sexual desires.  The unusual encounters with escorts for embryonic adult hailing\
  \ from country soaked in taboo subjects were now usual. In between those industrious\
  \ homosexuals, bisexuals, heterosexual I felt surrendering myself to the higher\
  \ self as I never realized that I was a refuge there cleansing myself with the same\
  \ lookalike broom which made me believe in this verse. \n\n''\u0935\u0938\u0941\u0927\
