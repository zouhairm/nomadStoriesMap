Text: "I had my return flight bought for December, my heart pulled in two: longing\
  \ for Bret, a Tim-Tebow-resembling college boy I was in love with, although I had\
  \ just touched down in Sevilla, Spain which was my dream and something I had planned\
  \ for a year. \nEach morning on my insanely picturesque commute through Parque Maria\
  \ Luisa to my internship at Santa Joaquina colegio, I would listen to heartbreak\
  \ songs thinking about Bret and yearning for his next text via the weird Messenger\
  \ app Pinger I had downloaded in a desperate attempt to stay in touch with him.\n\
  Mar, a confident, social young music teacher at the school, was the first to spot\
  \ the 23-year-old intern from America and invite me to her house after school to\
  \ eat and do an intercambio. Mar introduced me to who I thought were her roommates:\
  \ \u201CYou know David\u201D (the art teacher), \u201Cthere\u2019s Perico\u201D\
  \ (dreadlocks, jobless Spanish dude), and \u201Cthat\u2019s Andre\u201D (Italian\
  \ guy cooking in the kitchen). I focused my energy on understanding Mar, who spoke\
  \ no English & didn\u2019t slow down for me. But she took me in like a shy, foreign\
  \ sister, fed me, took me to clubs on the weekends, and 3 weeks later on a group\
  \ trip with her friends to David\u2019s pueblo, Caceres.\nThe steep, winding, streets\
  \ of Caceres were enchanting, but I only thought about Bret, while befriending Mar\u2019\
  s Italian friend, Francy. We communicated in our own hybrid of 3 languages we didn\u2019\
  t really know. We danced to tacky 90\u2019s music at the pueblo\u2019s only club,\
  \ went to the Patron Saint\u2019s church services on Sunday, and sampled tapas in\
  \ a traditional Spanish \u201Cpicoteo\u201D at the bars: ensaladilla rusa and patatas\
  \ bravas and cervezas.\nMy friend and I had a trip planned to Italy and thought\
  \ we could see the 2 Italians while there. Andre graciously agreed to host us and\
  \ pick us up from the airport, after a 4-hr delayed flight: I was so grateful. Somewhere\
  \ within those 3 days in the gorgeous countryside of Recanati, in between me going\
  \ outside to see Andre\u2019s dogs, us talking about books and piano in the mornings,\
  \ I forgot all about Bret. One night after a holy moment eating quattro stazione\
  \ pizza at his brother\u2019s restaurant, being introduced to Vino de Visciola,\
  \ the best cherry wine of all time, and losing at foosball, his friends came over\
  \ to watch a movie. Everyone slowly left and went to bed and it was just us 2 on\
  \ the couch. I leaned into him in a comfortably and he kissed me. The next month\
  \ he came to Sevilla to see me, secretly met me in Paris before I went back to the\
  \ US, and I knew I had fell in love for the 1st time."
