Text: "Chiang Mai is known as the Rose of the North for good reason. The second biggest\
  \ city in Thailand, it is a blossom that lures tourists to spend an extra day, travelers\
  \ to spend an extra week, and nomads like me to accidentally never leave. I ignore\
  \ the electrical surges that shock my fingertips daily, the conversation-pausing\
  \ roar of airplanes overhead, and the sometimes oppressive heat, as if under a spell.\
  \ Perhaps it is the kindness of the people; a seemingly endless kindness and calm\
  \ that is a sharp contrast to everything New England has bred into me. The only\
  \ word I can use is enchantment.\n\nIt makes you take notice of the way the air\
  \ in the morning smells like rain. The daily parade of scents in the humid aid tells\
  \ the story if the city. Ginger and galanga and star anise and roast pork. Motorcycle\
  \ exhaust and cooking gas. Sweet mango and too-sweet jackfruit. Thai tea and roasting\
  \ coffee. Cold mountain air and hot garbage. Night-blooming jasmine and butterfly\
  \ pea and trumpet honeysuckle. Chinese cigarettes and strong whiskey and fried chicken\
  \ with kaffir lime. The scents are so unabashedly present and unpretentious, like\
  \ the people who call this city home. Like the rose for which it\u2019s named, Chiang\
  \ Mai smells sweet and rich and deep.\n\nIn July of 2015, those amoras lose their\
  \ magic. I am two months pregnant, and every waft is an evil spell reducing me to\
  \ tears on the three-minute walk to the 7-11 for chocolate milk. If I don\u2019\
  t wake early enough to beat the noodle soup vendor, the smell of her cinnamon-infused\
  \ pork broth renders me green. Once the durian cart sets up shop on my block, I\
  \ announce to my husband, \u201CWe have to move.\u201D\n\nBut we don\u2019t move.\
  \ I venture to the 7-11 again, this time with a face mask. I expect that the vendors\
  \ will laugh, but they are tender and sweet, fanning the soup steam the opposite\
  \ direction and offering me little bags of rice. These women touch their stomachs\
  \ and smile. Over the next months, they will pat my growing baby bump, laugh when\
  \ I abandon vegetarianism in a pregnant fit and order a whole bag of chicken for\
  \ myself, grin at the pudgy baby in the stroller, and cheer as I jog by, sweating\
  \ off those secret bags of chicken. And now, as my toddler thanks them in Thai when\
  \ we buy a bowl of soup or shoves his little nose in a waxy white frangipani blossom,\
  \ I can\u2019t help but think that he will find those scents comforting in a way\
  \ that even he won\u2019t understand. They will always smell like home."
