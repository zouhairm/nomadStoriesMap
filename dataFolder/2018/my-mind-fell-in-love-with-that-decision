Text: "My mind fell in love with that decision... \nYea, it happened to me! \nFirst\
  \ of all, my name is Jos\xE9, I am from Portugal, I am 24 years old! I am graduated\
  \ in tourism and I enjoy writing since I remember! That's my story...\nSo, I was\
  \ finishing my tourism degree in the university of Coimbra in Portugal, but I needed\
  \ an internship in order to do it. So I asked to the univesity for an internship\
  \ there, in Coimbra. They got me one, something related with events organization\
  \ and attracting tourists to the downtown. It all seemed a nice concept to me...\
  \ But, it didn't go as I was expecting, soon as I started I realized that all the\
  \ tasks that I had weren't contributing for my personal developing. It was all the\
  \ same everyday, just distributing information to people on the streets or doing\
  \ small easy tasks like going to the bank or making calls to our associates. After\
  \ 4 months working there I wasn't feeling any motivation to continue. I wanted to\
  \ interrupt my internship and looking for something new, something that will push\
  \ me to the limit. And that's exactly what I did... So, I talked with the university\
  \ and I asked to interrupt my internship, in the meanwhile I was looking for something\
  \ that will provide me a good experience, that I will learn from it and will make\
  \ a better person. And that's exactly what happened, that decision changed my way\
  \ of facing life! \nSo, I got a 3 months internship in a hostel in Milan, Italy!\
  \ At the begining I was a little bit scared, a new country, a language that I wasn't\
  \ able to speak and I didn't know anyone there. But, it happened! I packed my things\
  \ and I flew to Milan. One of the best decisions I ever made... I arrived in Milan\
  \ as a boy, and I left it as a man!\nI arrived in Milan and I was amazed with everything!\
  \ Everything seemed bigger, I was hypnotized, contemplating every inch of construction,\
  \ listening carefuly every italian word... I was feeling that tingling in my stomach\
  \ like a child feels in christmas day! I was thinking \"what am I doing here?\"\
  \ but, on the other hand, I was thinking \"It's all in!\". So, I faced this experience\
  \ as an opportunity to learn, to push myself to the limit, to test my capacities\
  \ and to evolve as a human being. I met a lot of people that shared their experiences\
  \ with me and that made me see the world in a different way that I used to! Since\
  \ that moment that I am travelling and learning a lot and 2500 characters aren't\
  \ enough to express myself..."
