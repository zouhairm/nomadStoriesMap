Text: "While spending last semester abroad in Europe, I spontaneously planned a weekend\
  \ trip to Iceland. After planning trips to \"typical\" study abroad destinations\
  \ like Dublin, Amsterdam, and Spain, I was so excited to explore a place that not\
  \ many people travel to. While I only spent two full days in Iceland, they were\
  \ easily the best two days of both my semester and also my life to date.\nIceland\
  \ is breathtakingly beautiful. I expected to be surrounded by snow and ice but was\
  \ instead greeted by beautifully green vegetation, unending landscapes of volcanic\
  \ rock, and a completely unfamiliar language. My friends and I spent our first full\
  \ day on a bus tour of the Golden Circle. Despite being touristy, it provided an\
  \ amazing introduction to the history and beauty of Iceland. I experienced the startling\
  \ yet awesome eruptions of the Strokkur geyser, stood on the edge of an awe-inspiring\
  \ waterfall (while getting soaked), and even tried homemade tomato soup and tomato\
  \ ice cream at a small family owned tomato greenhouse! Every stop we made was more\
  \ beautiful than the next, starting with the mysterious mist that hung over the\
  \ geyser pools and ending at the amazing landscapes of Thingvellir National Park.\
  \ By the end of the day, my friends and I were just in awe. \nWe began our next\
  \ day by exploring downtown Reykjavik, which was filled with colorful houses, adorable\
  \ shops, and friendly people. After a few hours, we made our way to the Blue Lagoon,\
  \ where we experienced a natural phenomenon. The beautiful light blue of the water\
  \ seemed almost unreal, and being able to float on my back while staring through\
  \ the mist at an unending sky filled with stars was so humbling. It was there that\
  \ I realized just how small I am compared to the rest of the universe. After an\
  \ amazing day at one of the 25 Wonders of the World, we hopped on the bus to take\
  \ us back to Reykjavik. It was on the bus ride back that we witnessed something\
  \ we had been hoping for the whole trip - the Northern Lights. It's hard to describe\
  \ my feelings when I saw the bright green arc stretched across the sky; I felt like\
  \ laughing and crying all at once. Witnessing something that so few people do was\
  \ so special, and was the perfect end to our trip. \nDuring my weekend in Iceland,\
  \ I was pushed out of my comfort zone and experienced an entirely different environment.\
  \ I have so much respect and admiration for the kind people of Iceland (who speak\
  \ perfect English!) and their beautiful country."
