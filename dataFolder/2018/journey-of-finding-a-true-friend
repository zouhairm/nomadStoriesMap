Text: "Struggle starts the second you  are pulled into this world. In every nuk and\
  \ corner.\nYou have to live alone, No actually survive alone. But nobody will teach\
  \ you how to,it is assumed that it is inbuilt in you. It is said that life is precious\
  \ and given only once. In fact Life is a story , not a short one , but a long long\
  \ story of how you died. A traveller isn't one who have visited the entire world\
  \ or loves to roam around. Instead one who observes every minute detail while walking,talking,or\
  \ doing anything and have that zeal, passion to explore places or people's mind.\
  \ My journey started the day I learned I am different, I don't belong to these people\
  \ who love to showoff their power,money and nowadays  even talent.\nWho said that\
  \ for travelling you need money. I didn't, I travelled for free of cost. I travelled\
  \ and am still in this journey of my life. I went to Delhi when was a kid. Observed\
  \ the people there.  And found that everyone  is selfish be it the seller , the\
  \ customer or the one who just enjoyed. Then I travelled  through punjab. Nawasahar...\
  \ famous for salwar suit , spicy and tasty food.Met  same type of people.\nTravelled\
  \ through Rajasthan.  The Amer fort, Hawa mahal ..the huge forts full of ancient\
  \ and aroma of past. Every door telling a different  story. The story of grief ,\
  \ laughter , pain , trust written on every brick of each and every wall. Ah! How\
  \ can I forget about Udaipur, the fateh Sagar, beautiful gardens and scenery.  Mount\
  \ Abu the heaven of Rajasthan...Those hills , the boat rides , that spicy maggi\
  \ with a touch of love in it. The Bhangarh fort , told to be haunted.  But didn't\
  \ see anything but felt the negative energy. Banasthali village - these people ,\
  \ rajasthani food. \nTravelled much but you know what found a true friend  ME MY\
  \ SOUL"
