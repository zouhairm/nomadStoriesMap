Text: "Manoj \u2013 this name has been stuck in my mind and my heart as well since\
  \ the day I got back from Barhamatal Trek in Uttarakhand. It\u2019s not a connection\
  \ of love or anything else; it\u2019s a cosmic connection which I will cherish my\
  \ whole life. Manoj was our local guide while trekking to the summit (12,420 ft.)\n\
  \nThere were three persons guiding our group. One was at the beginning, one in the\
  \ middle and one at the end. Manoj was at the end and so was I. I was very slow\
  \ and had trouble breathing and walking. He is the most sort-out person I have ever\
  \ met that too at the age of 23. It used to get very windy and chilly when the sun\
  \ used to set down. I was freezing even after wearing five layers of clothes and\
  \ covered head to toe. \n\nOn the morning of 15 January, we set out to ascend the\
  \ summit. At that time, the Sun was still hidden behind the mountains. While walking\
  \ the trail, Manoj suddenly stopped where the ray of Sun was carpeting the land.\
  \ I saw him standing with his both hands joined and praying to the Sun. It was at\
  \ this moment that I fell in love with this man and his humbleness. Love doesn\u2019\
  t have to be only of one kind. \n\nEvery time I looked at him, it was like I was\
  \ looking at him for the first time. No matter how many days passed, his face didn\u2019\
  t look old; he had something new in his eyes every day. Later, I realized that it\
  \ was because his soul never got old. His soul was getting better with every ray\
  \ of Sun hugging him. He and the mountains both taught me the importance of Sun\
  \ and being humble because nature is gigantic. You don\u2019t mess with nature.\
  \ \n\nManoj has earned so much respect from me that I don\u2019t think I would ever\
  \ respect anyone this much ever. I still remember his one-liners, his smile, his\
  \ support, his eyes (which by the way are just like that of Ian Somerhalder\u2019\
  s). Somehow I also learned that being last always doesn\u2019t mean \u2018being\
  \ last\u2019. It means that you are slow but not a failure. No one can decide who\
  \ you are except you. So, I was a winner; I am a winner even after being last. I\
  \ learned so much from our local guide that no one in the city could have taught\
  \ me ever. \n\nIt is important to connect with the locals, soak in their essence,\
  \ values, culture, ethics and what not. \n\nAn old man had said that if you take\
  \ something from a place you visit, try to give equally back to that place. I took\
  \ memories of Manoj and I hope I gave him some to cherish as well \u2013 a few laughs,\
  \ a few moments, a few glances."
