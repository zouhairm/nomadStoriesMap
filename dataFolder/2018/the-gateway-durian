Text: "It's long past sundown in Singapore. The streets are bustling with Friday night\
  \ crowds, illuminated by fluorescent mall lights. My dining companion sits opposite\
  \ me, a look of delight on his face, the kind that only comes with the opportunity\
  \ to introduce someone to a controlled substance they haven't experienced before.\
  \ \n\nHe tells me he knows just the street, just the guy. We'll have to drive there\
  \ though, as it's some way across town. The traffic slowly thins out as we pull\
  \ up at a small roadside stall, lit up with flickering lamps. A few low plastic\
  \ tables are laid out. We are not alone and thus, clearly in the right place.\n\n\
  A few minutes discussion with the vendor, some minor negotiation, money is handed\
  \ over and it arrives at the table. The translation, meaning 'spike' or 'thorn',\
  \ is apt both visually and odorously.  Here, sitting on the table in front of us,\
  \ is the infamous durian, King of Fruits. \n\nRewind to an hour earlier in the evening.\
  \ We are discussing my few days experience of Singapore, and talk inevitably turns\
  \ to food. Earlier that day I had noted with a chuckle to myself signs in the subway\
  \ system insisting that customers should not consume durian on board. It then occurred\
  \ to me that I was yet to consume it myself. \n\nThe smell is something notoriously\
  \ difficult to describe. The novelist Anthony Burgess likens durian to \"eating\
  \ sweet raspberry blancmange in the lavatory\". The durian smell/taste dichotomy\
  \ is much like that of aged blue cheese. You probably wouldn't want to wear a necklace\
  \ made of it, or use it as perfume, but the taste is sublime, strong, unctuous and\
  \ sweet, the texture of ripe avocado and the flavour of almond ice cream.\n\nBack\
  \ to the table. Since polishing off a small, gateway durian, another, larger one\
  \ has appeared enthusiastically in its place. Our companion recoils as it is cut\
  \ open and tells us that while durian is enduringly popular in her hometown Jakarta,\
  \ she is one of the many people who cannot stand it. Indeed, durian is so divisive,\
  \ it is banned from many hotels, taxis and public transport systems. \n\nEqually\
  \ however, durian is subject of much adoration, the centrepiece of statues (Kampot,\
  \ Cambodia), the inspiration for architecture (Esplanade Building, Singapore) and\
  \ suggested aphrodisiac (\"when the durian falls the sarong comes up\", a traditional\
  \ Indonesian saying).\n\nWhether you love it or hate it, it's reputation, and stench,\
  \ proceeds it."
