Text: "Everyone remembers the evil uncle-impostor who broke into the life of young\
  \ guy Aladdin and changed his quiet living?! Originally this villain was from Morocco,\
  \ whose inhabitants at that time were called Maghribans. So the dreams of visiting\
  \ a real Arabian fairy tale brought me here.\n\nHowever, the \"fairy tale\" happened\
  \ to be even more mysterious with a complicated mixture of different historical\
  \ epochs and people: Berbers, Romans, Byzantines and only then Arabs, Turks and\
  \ French. Having walked along the paths of several civilizations, I realized that\
  \ this fairy tale can never be called only \u201CArabic\u201D ...\n\nFour imperial\
  \ cities of Marrakech, Fez, Meknes and Rabat, four different souls with some native\
  \ relationship. Each of them can be fairly called a \"storehouse\" of turbulent\
  \ events as well as many others smaller but not less unique cities and corners of\
  \ this amazing country. \n\nIt happens often that we build up some pictures in our\
  \ imagination, however, later in reality we find out that the colors are not the\
  \ ones we imagined, the taste is not the same..., just illusions that quickly disappear\
  \ ... Referring to Morocco I can easily confirm that I imagined my Moroccan fairy\
  \ tale exactly like it is - extremely bright, juicy, colorful, funny, impactful\
  \ and mysterious!\nMorocco is a successful, I would even say, \"triumphant\" symbiosis\
  \ of rich history, colorful architecture of the east and modern European culture,\
  \ one of a kind where antiquity peacefully coexists with a bright and dynamic modern\
  \ life, truly Moroccan authenticity along with French chic. \n\nOnly in Morocco\
  \ nowadays the main \"characters\" from well-known fairy tales meet us in everyday\
  \ life: snake charmers, magicians, fire swallowers, henna body artists, fortune\
  \ tellers, sellers of magic cures and etc.... If I had come here in childhood I\
  \ would have probably screamed out at every step pointing with finger at these people\
  \ here recognizing dervishes and magicians.\nHowever, the fairy tale becomes a reality,\
  \ because all these heroes are actual inhabitants of this astonishing country, they\
  \ live, walk, pass by not for \"beauty\" and not for artificial recreation of antiquity\
  \ image for tourists.... This is their real lifestyle to live, to work and go on.\n\
  Morocco has always attracted famous people that once travelled here used to come\
  \ back again and again. President of the USA F.Roosevelt wrote to the great British\
  \ politician W.Churchill: \"Come, this is the best place in the world!\"\nI fully\
  \ agree with this!!!"
