Text: "- Where are your parents? Do they live here?\n\n- My mum died, I was little.\n\
  \n- Oh, I\u2019m sorry. What about your dad?\n\n- Yes, Dad lives far, somewhere\
  \ else with my brother.\n\nSey Ha looked down on her naked, sandy feet while I pushed\
  \ her again on the swing. We stayed quiet for a little while then I decided to sit\
  \ down in front of her. I looked into those big, brown eyes and asked that burning\
  \ question that I wanted to ask from the moment I\u2019ve arrived there. \n\n- Are\
  \ you happy here?\n\nShe looked at me and her little, bronze cheeks lifted from\
  \ the huge smile on her face. \n\n- I\u2019m very happy.\n\n- Why?\n\nI had to ask.\
  \ I had to know how it\u2019s possible. I couldn\u2019t imagine after all she\u2019\
  s been through, how on earth this twelve-years-old girl can still be happy with\
  \ her life. \n\n- Before, I was on streets. I had to beg for money. No food. Here,\
  \ we eat and I have a bed. I have friends. We are one big family. I can go to school\
  \ and we play a lot.\n\nI smiled and tickled her. She jumped off the swing laughing\
  \ and gave me a hug. I was holding her tight while I was patting her back like if\
  \ I would try to calm a crying baby. Except, she was happy... Happy! The bells sounded\
  \ which meant it was the end of \u201Cus time\u201D and I had to leave. She let\
  \ go of me and looked at me.\n\n- You come back?\n\nI wanted to cry. I remembered\
  \ what Lisa said. \u201CBe strong and make it quick. If you cry, they will cry\u201D\
  . So I forced a smile on my face. \n\n- Maybe not next year but I will try my best\
  \ to come back. Now, walk me to the gate, will you? \n\nShe nodded and took my hand.\
  \ She smiled again as she noticed I was wearing the rubber bracelet she gave me\
  \ a few days ago. I gave her a final hug before I sat in my tuk-tuk and waved her\
  \ goodbye.\n\nI didn\u2019t sleep much that night. I also had to be up early as\
  \ we were going to watch the sunrise at Angkor Wat. I thought this is going to be\
  \ the highlight of my trip. I was sitting on the ruins of a library watching how\
  \ the dark sky slowly turned into purple and pink from the rising sun. Although,\
  \ I came to Cambodia to volunteer for the Green Gecko project which supports children\
  \ and families who lived and begged on the streets of Siem Reap, I was more interested\
  \ in visiting places like the ancient temples, the flowering lotus farms and the\
  \ sacred mountains. \n\nI didn\u2019t expect back then that I can find something\
  \ more satisfying than exploring new places. However, Sey Ha managed to surprise\
  \ me with the biggest gift I ever received: the answer to my own happiness. Being\
  \ grateful!"
