Text: "They say stars can\u2019t shine without darkness. I have learned this to be\
  \ true when I was on an adventurous volunteer working trip in Costa Rica. Far away\
  \ from home, still mourning my grandfather\u2019s death and completely at odds with\
  \ my class mate who traveled there with me, I felt as if the whole world had abandoned\
  \ me and I had to face the dangers of life and work in the Central American rainforest\
  \ on my own. Not only was the jungle at night literally one of the darkest places\
  \ I have experienced but also metaphorically, I was battling some dark times. My\
  \ biggest luck was meeting a group of ticos (how Costa Ricans call themselves) who\
  \ invited me out and gave me a glimpse of the amazing time I could have had in their\
  \ country. We went downtown and some beers together. They made me dance salsa and\
  \ not feel weird about it \u2013 I enjoyed it, even if I was the only non-latin\
  \ person at the bar. Later we had deep conversations about cultural differences\
  \ and the meaning of life right on the beach with cocktails in our hands. Not what\
  \ I had expected from my volunteer project but definitely the most authentic impression\
  \ of life in Costa Rica that I could get. After my work project was finished, I\
  \ went to stay with one of the guys who showed me the night sky when I was too focused\
  \ on the darkness. He made it his personal mission to make me love his country and\
  \ culture and to make sure I\u2019d never forget this adventure. The last four days\
  \ of my stay exceeded all my fabulous expectations: I got to see the capital of\
  \ Costa Rica, went to an active volcano and met many kind and welcoming locals.\
  \ Not only did this tico take me to all the great places he knew but most importantly\
  \ he gave me a home and showed me what it means to live in Costa Rica, that the\
  \ true meaning of pura vida cannot be understood rationally but that it must be\
  \ felt and lived. As the German that I am I can say that I could probably never\
  \ be an authentic tica but the experiences I made thanks to the very dedicated tico\
  \ changed me as a person forever. I now know how peaceful life can be when you live\
  \ in the present and don\u2019t let stress get to you, I know that being open and\
  \ showing your emotions doesn\u2019t make you vulnerable and, most importantly,\
  \ I know that during a dark night you just need to look up for the stars to guide\
  \ you. I never expected to have such a hard time and lose a friend due to this trip\
  \ but the last thing I had expected was making a new friend for life whom I\u2019\
  ll get to show my world this summer."
