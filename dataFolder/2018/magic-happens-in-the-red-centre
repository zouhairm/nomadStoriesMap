Text: "Since I was a kid, I dreamt of visiting Uluru. I was only ten when I read a\
  \ comic strip about it and I never stopped dreaming of seeing it. Twenty years later,\
  \ I went to Australia for six months and I decided to book a camping tour in the\
  \ Red Centre. I left Adelaide to Alice Springs and the long bus journey and the\
  \ flu I got just before leaving didn't lower my excitement at all.\nThe tour bus\
  \ picked up a few of us from the hostel at dawn and we started introducing ourselves\
  \ and getting to know each other. We were a pretty nice mix of people and nationalities\
  \ and some of us even ended up meeting again in other tours. Uluru is magic, it\
  \ is easy to feel it as soon as you enter the national park, and getting near the\
  \ rock made me feel humble, as if conscious of the power of Mother Earth as the\
  \ locals have felt it for thousands of years.\nIt was June and during the day the\
  \ temperature was nice, but at night it would fall to 0\xBAC. Our swags and sleeping\
  \ bags were nice, but I was really thankful to our fire marshals for keeping the\
  \ fire on all night and keeping us warm. One of them, actually, was quite nice and\
  \ we started chatting a bit. He was taking plenty of photos and I was really interested.\n\
  The three days of the tour went too fast and we were soon back in Alice Springs,\
  \ tired but rich after all we experiences and learnt in the desert. Our leaving\
  \ dinner was a good excuse to talk a bit more and exchange numbers and e-mail to\
  \ stay in touch afterwards. We all added each other on Facebook and kept following\
  \ everyone's adventures in Australia and around the world. When Instagram arrived,\
  \ I found that my favourite fire marshal had an account. He was still sharing his\
  \ beautiful pictures and he was still in the Down Under, he had just moved to New\
  \ Zealand. We started talking again about photos and travel adventures, more and\
  \ more often, but the last thing that I expected was that he would invite me to\
  \ join him in New Zealand as we both regretted parting ways in Australia. I bought\
  \ my ticket to Christchurch and now we take most of those pictures together."
