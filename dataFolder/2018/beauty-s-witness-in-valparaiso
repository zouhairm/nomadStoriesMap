Text: "The streets of Valparaiso, Chile. The city, its murals, and its people are\
  \ all steeped in sadness and joy, love and moonlight, and the entire place reeks\
  \ of decrepitude but is revived by the loving touch of artists. My footfalls hit\
  \ the cobblestones in rhythm with my breath, giving a measuredly punctuated characteristic\
  \ to steep streets that are otherwise happily chaotic, twining around buildings\
  \ and pursuing bustling humanity until the land is overtaken by the waters of the\
  \ sea. \n\nThat evening, following a leisurely dinner, I shifted my gaze from the\
  \ softly darkening sky out the window to the owner. He fit in well with this city\
  \ that bridged tiredness and vigor so gracefully.\u201CHow long have you been in\
  \ Valparaiso?\u201D I asked. \"Me?\" One eyebrow twitched upwards. \"I have lived\
  \ here for all of my life.\" He paused and I nodded at him to continue. \"I used\
  \ to dream of traveling. But I met a woman, and well, that was it,\u201D he said,\
  \ shrugging restlessly. His close-set blue eyes took on a dreamy, otherworldly expression\
  \ and abruptly stepping alongside my chair, he pointed to the ground below a tree\
  \ outside. \"All I have left of her is that little rock.\" At my bemused expression,\
  \ he shook his head. \"She had our daughter. Ana. Six days later, they both died\
  \ of infection. I could do nothing to help them. My wife is buried elsewhere but\
  \ mi hija, she is there.\"  He gestured with his chin and his voice trailed off\
  \ as we both stared hard out the window. The tree\u2019s roots had grown off to\
  \ either side, curving around the headstone in a shape that was cradle-like, almost\
  \ motherly. \n\nI felt wooden and my body trembled as I felt anew my fear of six\
  \ months ago when the tiny being briefly nurtured by my own body was suddenly, violently\
  \ dispelled. Miscarriage. I don't know why my body rejected it, but on the fifth\
  \ day of my awareness of myself as a mother, it was over. I understood his helplessness\
  \ altogether too well. I finally forced myself to speak. \u201CI also lost a child.\
  \ I will never know why.\u201D My voice broke. I felt the palm of his hand rest\
  \ on my bowed head and he said gently, \"Ah. We feel the same things, then, amiga.\"\
  \ \n\nWe stood together that way for several minutes. In the comfortable space of\
  \ our silence, I realized that here, people and things are beautiful in spite of,\
  \ or maybe even because of, their damage. They just need to be seen. I am indeed\
  \ glad to have tripped along the corridors of this place and will remember my time\
  \ in Valparaiso with wonder and humility."
