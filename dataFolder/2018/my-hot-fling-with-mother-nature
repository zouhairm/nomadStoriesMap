Text: "Crouching down in half a foot of ash behind a 4WD full of people I didn\u2019\
  t know, was the moment that made me rethink my life decisions. I pulled up my shorts,\
  \ jumped back in the vehicle and wiped the ash from my face. \u201CNot long until\
  \ we reach the mountain now\u201D yelled the tour guide over the enthusiastic but\
  \ slightly terrified tourists. \n\nI started to hear a loud rumbling, it was like\
  \ thunder rolling through the sky followed by a bursting liquid noise. This is exactly\
  \ what I imagined a volcano to sound like, not that I ever imagined going to see\
  \ a volcano, especially not a live one that spurts actual hot lava. \u201CThis is\
  \ us\u201D yelled the tour guide. we all jumped out of the truck, grabbed our bags\
  \ and started the long walk up the violent mountain that had held its place on the\
  \ land for millions of years. \n\nWalking through the ash, stones and black rocks\
  \ that had been spat out by this incredible force at some stage I realized the ground\
  \ was moving. On closer investigation it wasn\u2019t the ground at all, it was geckos,\
  \ tens of thousands of them! Living on the base of the volcano and in my opinion\
  \ on the edge, anyhow, navigating through these geckos on top of everything else\
  \ gave me another reason to question my motives for this trip.\n\nNearly out of\
  \ breath, I reached the summit and was instructed to stay alert and not to get too\
  \ close to the edge. I\u2019m not going to lie, I was speechless. Looking into what\
  \ looked like Mount Doom from Lord of the Rings, I felt everything! Excitement,\
  \ fear, happiness, hot, tired, energized and mesmerized. I needed a photo so I could\
  \ remember this for the rest of my life. I asked a fellow traveller if he would\
  \ mind capturing this moment for me and as I started to pose for the photograph\
  \ the mountain raged and let out a thundersome growl. \n\nSuddenly I felt hot, really\
  \ hot and not in the beautiful sense. As I turned around I gasped, luminous orange\
  \ lava was flying high up into the sky, letting off its energy in the form of burning\
  \ heat straight into the atmosphere, too close to me.  I jumped back and watched\
  \ from a distance, I decided to heed the warning from the tour guide. \n\nDrenched\
  \ in ash I jumped back into the 4WD to start the long journey back to our accommodation.\
  \ After facing my own Mount Doom just as Frodo had, I could now face anything, the\
  \ memory of asking the driver to stop the truck for me to pee in a pile of ash on\
  \ the way to the volcano became a mere laughable detail of my Tanna Island expedition."
