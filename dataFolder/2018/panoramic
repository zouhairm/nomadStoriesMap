Text: "Orange contrasts with blue, and both those colours contrast with grey. The\
  \ ragged cracks of the rock face pointed like arrows to the hidden treasure trove\
  \ beneath.  In the basin of cool blue water, shielded from the sun by the rising\
  \ cliffs is a goldfish pond. Filled with green algae plants, small rocks and crevices,\
  \ it is the perfect place for goldfish to flourish. Their orange-silver scales reflect\
  \ the scatterings of sunlight that make it through the shadows cast by the rock.\
  \ Peering down at them from my vantage point I cant help but picture my own pond\
  \ back at home, and marvel at the similarities between the two - of course, home\
  \ is not 30 degrees, sandy beaches, and sangria - but even hundreds of miles away,\
  \ there are still things that remind me of home. \n\nWalking a little way to my\
  \ left, the path leads out of the rocky cliffs and onto an open path along the mountainside.\
  \ The view is something else entirely. If you are ever lucky enough to visit the\
  \ Costa del Sol, the small town of Mijas, nestled in the mountains, is the one thing\
  \ you must not miss out on. From my vantage point, I can see miles and miles of\
  \ coastline, stretching out as far as I can see. Huge container ships look like\
  \ tiny dinghies and the city below looks like a child's Lego creation.  Walking\
  \ further, admiring the wildflowers growing on the edge of the dirt track, I find\
  \ myself looking down on two people.\n\nThe couple walk together, hand in hand.\
  \ Both women have blonde hair, one tied in a braid, and both are wearing those colourful\
  \ sarongs that are the hot ticket item for beach sellers this year. Looking out\
  \ over the ocean, I watch as one sinks down on one knee and pulls out a small box.\
  \ I turn to leave just as they embrace each-other with joy. It feels inappropriate\
  \ to stick around at such a tender moment in their lives. Later on, as I sit in\
  \ one of the many small cafe's, sipping my sangria, I think about the newly engaged\
  \ couple. I hope they have many happy years together, and I rejoice in the fact\
  \ that people are starting to be able to proclaim love to whomever they want and\
  \ wonder at how some people can be so unaccepting of something so beautiful.\n\n\
  My excursion to visit the goldfish turned into one of the most eyeopening moments\
  \ in my life, making me realise how much some people take for granted.\nThe panoramic\
  \ viewpoint is one of the most romantic locations I can think of and someday I would\
  \ like to return, hopefully holding hands with someone who I can call my own."
