Text: "Pushing the mosquito net aside, I stepped down and onto the floor cracks Every\
  \ morning, the air was smoky, as if the gaslights from the previous evening had\
  \ stayed late into the night to converse and die off right before the sun rose.\
  \ I was strict about my preference to walk along the cracks and, staying faithful\
  \ to my youthful superstitions, I followed the cracks. The scene that revealed itself\
  \  - of waves in the near distance, bringing memories of horrific jellyfish escapades\
  \ -, was not much more than an attractive banality by now. Only in hindsight would\
  \ I start appreciating the disturbing noise of insects inhabiting the walls of my\
  \ bungalow, the poignant smell of burning gaslights during dinner, the stressfully\
  \ comforting noise of Malagasy coming from behind a hut.\n\nThe breakfast that day,\
  \ the previous one, and the next one, was bread and strawberry jam. As we got to\
  \ know Rinda better, we started inviting him to come over for breakfast with us.\
  \ We would spend the mornings collecting the crumbs off our table by pressing our\
  \ fingers against them, persevering until the very last one would be gone. Rinda\
  \ had taught us to leave nothing behind - a single grain of rice left behind in\
  \ our plates would be a shame. \n\nWith Rinda, we spent hours in front of people's\
  \ huts reading Le Petit Nicolas and pretending to understand the funny parts. It\
  \ was the bliss of a summer far away from what we knew all too well. Rinda remained\
  \ mysteriously incomprehensible until the end, but we grew to understand his eyes\
  \ that sparkled and the way his voice trembled when he said hi.  \n\nOne day - it\
  \ was our last day - we were walking, allowing our bare feet to be touched by the\
  \ ocean - the very same ocean we would run away from in suffocating laughter every\
  \ time Rinda emerged with distasteful sea creatures in hand. Those chases ended\
  \ among the branches of trees, limbs intertwined and flying and screams so memorable\
  \ I still recall them, 12 years later. \n\nThat day, Rinda began to fumble with\
  \ his fingers. A song came out of him that I found funny. I felt an uncomfortable\
  \ sense of beauty, as I listened to his song and when I looked at him, I realized\
  \ he was not where I was. He was letting go. Tears were running down his cheeks,\
  \ cheeks I had never paid attention to.  Rinda had taught us to never leave anything\
  \ behind, but we had not listened past the grains of rice we shared. We were leaving\
  \ the next morning, oblivious and excited to see the rest of Madagascar."
