Text: "If you still do not know what country you want to visit, I can help you, you\
  \ just have to ask yourself a question. What makes you happy? ... Do you already\
  \ have the answer? If you still do not know for sure I can help you.\n\nI have taken\
  \ care of asking the same question to a large number of people, from different countries,\
  \ of course. I will show you a brief report of what I got:\n\nLaugh, Who does not\
  \ love to laugh? To laugh you need your diversity of friends, I mean the sentimental,\
  \ the taste, the depressed, the intellectual ... and surely there is more, you need\
  \ them, they will always do or say something that will fall in grace.\n\nEating,\
  \ but who cook needs to have that passion, the desire to get a smile by just putting\
  \ a plate on your table, if the place you go have that gift you'll see how great\
  \ it is to go to another country, know their cuisine and wonder \"How come I had\
  \ not tried that dish yet?\"\n\nTo live adventures, is something magnificent, to\
  \ go into hidden places, unusual and mysterious, like the jungle, to get in touch\
  \ with nature and discover its diversity, or simply something common, such as a\
  \ beach, a park or a fair, what matters is to live the adventure, exceed our limits,\
  \ take risks and open ourselves to what that place can teach us.\n\nThey want to\
  \ visit a country with those characteristics they need to come to Colombia! AND\
  \ YOU TOO. Do you want to know why I say it? Because what they mentioned I have\
  \ already lived it in my own flesh \"here is so much happiness\". I present to you\
  \ my beloved country, it has the greatest variety in the world, its people are very\
  \ happy, they will really make you laugh, and the best thing is that there is something\
  \ for everyone, you must befriend her !, her food is the more flavorful, Have you\
  \ already tried \"paisa tray\", \"tamale\" or \"tolimense suckling pig\"? I invite\
  \ you to taste the best food on the planet earth !, and if you want to live adventures\
  \ \"Colombia itself is an adventure \"You can come a thousand times, and you will\
  \ never know it, you will have a number of places to visit, I will name you some:\"\
  \ Tayrona National Park \",\" Cabo de la Vela \",\" Ca\xF1o Crystals \"(one of the\
  \ seven natural wonders of the world), \"the island of san andr\xE9s\", \"the carnival\
  \ of Barranquilla\" or \"the Amazon rainforest\" (with the greatest diversity of\
  \ flora and fauna in the world).\n\nDo not think twice, come, I invite you, you\
  \ need to come to this paradise, I guarantee it: Colombia will make you happy!"
