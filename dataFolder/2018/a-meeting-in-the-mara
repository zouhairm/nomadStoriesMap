Text: "The sun was setting over the Mara river as our guide informed us that we would\
  \ be making our way back to camp for dinner. As the engine of the overlander fired\
  \ up I took one last look at the thrashing crocodiles who had been waging war on\
  \ the wading wildebeest and zebra who had dared make the infamous crossing. It was\
  \ migration season in the Masai Mara and the seemingly endless savanna was transformed\
  \ into a highway of animals making their way south into Tanzania's Serengeti NP.\n\
  \nThe ride back to camp was an hour long but the time flew past as our guide pointed\
  \ out every animal he saw. Secretary bird he said as he pointed out a strutting\
  \ white bird that was stalking through the grass. \"Eland\" he said as he pointed\
  \ out the monstrous and muscular horned antelope that was perched on a mound looking\
  \ around with caution. \"Grant's gazelle, Thompson gazelle, ostrich, zebra, rhino,\
  \ wildebeest, giraffe, zebra, wildebeest, zebra,\" he turned smiling in that playful\
  \ but genuine way that you grow accustomed to in Kenya. \"Ok, ok,\" he said. \"\
  I know you're sick of wildebeest and zebra.\"\n\nThe passengers chuckled as they\
  \ kept their eyes fixed on a setting sun that turned the golden grass into an orange\
  \ sea of fire on the horizon. It was the first day in the park and the journey from\
  \ Nairobi had been long. \"Pole, pole\" was the mantra of the guide - a Swahili\
  \ term meaning \"slowly, slowly.\" A local's way of reminding us that nothing goes\
  \ quickly in Africa.\n\nThe camp itself was quaint and basic. There was a sheltered\
  \ open air kitchen near a fire a pit and a dozen or so wooden huts big enough for\
  \ two camp beds each, spread across an area the size of a soccer field with some\
  \ outhouses on the far side bordering the shrubbery. \n\nThe food was traditional\
  \ Kenyan meat or vegetable stew and clump of Ugali - a cornmeal dough-like staple\
  \ that my companions mostly hated but that I had grown fond of. After dinner and\
  \ a few drinks we said our good nights and turned in for a well earned rest. \n\n\
  At 1 AM I woke up desperate to relieve myself and cursing those extra bottles of\
  \ Tusker beer from dinner. Still drowsy I stepped out of my hut and into the cool\
  \ air. I hadn't taken twelve steps towards the outhouse before I realized I was\
  \ face to face with a real tusker, a bull elephant no more than ten feet from where\
  \ I stood and as aware of me as I was of him. I slowly stepped backwards and back\
  \ into the sanctuary of my room. My heart racing I sat down on my bed. I no longer\
  \ needed the bathroom."
