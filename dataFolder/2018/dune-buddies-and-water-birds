Text: "When I first moved to San Francisco, I met an intuitive stranger at a cheap\
  \ Vietnamese restaurant. After finishing our sandwiches, the man approached me and\
  \ asked to read my fortune. Beneath all the talk of water birds and star signs,\
  \ I knew he and I shared a truth. I couldn't identify it, but I felt it.  He said,\
  \ \"You have two choices in life: to live in love, or live in fear.\"       \n\n\
  Many years later, sitting on a gay nude beach just south of Lisbon, I met a similar\
  \ stranger. He was grey-haired, a Hemingway type, well-proportioned, but shy, reading\
  \ the paper. I said hello, startling him from his page.\n\nHe was from France, retired\
  \ here for summers, I think. I don't speak French, he didn't speak English. He was\
  \ once a race car driver. I asked about the paper. \n\nOrlando is all I could make\
  \ out. I knew from his tone it wasn't about Mickey Mouse. \n\nWe just sat, deeply\
  \ saddened and looked at the ocean. Naked in a dune, silent in the sun. I said my\
  \ goodbyes best I could and walked all the way back to where the Uber dropped me,\
  \ forgetting one thing. I had no reception out there and there was not a single\
  \ cab. Luckily, there was a bar, two hours, a friend of a friend. \n\nThree hours\
  \ later, I consider walking. And then, up comes my dune buddy. He dresses out of\
  \ his shorts into his street clothes. He gives me another look, asks if I wanted\
  \ a ride to town. I say yes when...\n\nThe cab arrives. The driver knows who the\
  \ American is, and he isn't going to be happy if I don't get in his cab. So me and\
  \ Hemingway share a comforting glance. And it's that glance that I held onto as\
  \ I rode home with a cabbie who was listening to terrible pop and talking about\
  \ where I could find loose women.\n\nGrowing up I never thought I'd be able to hold\
  \ someone's hand in public. I never thought I'd be able to tell someone \"I love\
  \ you.\" I never thought I'd get a happily ever after. \n\nBut bit by bit, with\
  \ each parade or chat bubble, night out at the bar or afternoon pool party, gay\
  \ gatherings allowed me to let the fear slip away; for it to be replaced by the\
  \ love found in a communal fellowship. The celebration of that fellowship was cut\
  \ short for far too many. While it will be a challenge to let the anger and sadness\
  \ go, I am going to do my best to live in love and leave the living in fear for\
  \ those who hide behind guns. \n\nNow back in the hotel, like any good American\
  \ I clicked publish to my sincere Facebook post, wondered how many Likes it would\
  \ get, jerked off, and turned on HBO."
