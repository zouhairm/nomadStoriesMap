Text: "Vilakazi street was covered in the kind of souvenir merchandise you could find\
  \ in any tourist trap: tapestries of saturated blue, yellow and orange; carved and\
  \ painted statues; neon green and bright red clothes with tribal prints; earrings\
  \ made from impala bones and colorful beads.\n\nAmong the bright stalls was a modest\
  \ and undecorated table with various sand paintings in glass bottles, uncommon items\
  \ in these areas. \n\nHis face lit up when I approached his display and he eagerly\
  \ showed me his art: bottles of different sizes with \u201CSoweto\u201D, \u201C\
  South Africa\u201D, \u201CI [heart] Mom\u201D and \u201CI [heart] Dad\u201D traced\
  \ in sands of muted white, yellow, red and brown. He was thin and wrinkly but bursting\
  \ with the energy and enthusiasm of a salesman. Even with thousands of tourists\
  \ visiting every year, competition was fierce and every vendor needed to maintain\
  \ that attitude to make a sale.\n\nAs he was talking about his art, he brought up\
  \ his teenage son and how good the kid was at sand-painting. He spoke with pride\
  \ and joy about his son\u2019s talent and desire to follow in his footsteps. \n\n\
  \u201CBut I told him no, you can\u2019t make money and feed your family with this\u201D\
  . His statement struck me. Not so much what he said but how he said it, in a matter\
  \ of fact way, as if it was a story about an acquaintance and not his son.\n\nI\
  \ knew enough about the country to know he was right. Constitutional apartheid had\
  \ been over for two decades but economic apartheid still reigned and the segregation\
  \ was obvious. The rich had their bazaars where you can find organic food and artisanal\
  \ jewelry. The poor had their markets filled with knock-off Rolexes and cheap essential\
  \ goods for the home. \n\nBy the quality of his art, it should have been in the\
  \ fancy bazaar but instead, it's here, in the townships. It's as if there was an\
  \ invisible wall blocking goods from crossing to the other side.\n\nHe was hoping\
  \ for his art to not get lost but he seemed to have accepted its impending end and\
  \ the harsh reality of economic apartheid. He quickly changed the topic and we went\
  \ on to talk about South African food. But I was still thinking about his son. I\
  \ felt helpless because the only support I could offer at that moment was buying\
  \ some of his art.\n\nAs I left Vilakazi, I knew what the future would hold for\
  \ him and his work. But part of me was hoping that chance and technology would allow\
  \ his son to follow his passion and that his entrepreneurial efforts would bring\
  \ those sand paintings to the other side of the economic divide."
