Text: "Jackie, a 68 kg semi-wild female Orangutan, clasping my partner's wrist while\
  \ her tiny baby suckled the face of his go-pro, just about sums up our Sumatra trip.\
  \ What our guide, Ling, had not told us was how close people can sometimes get to\
  \ these charismatic and human-like apes. \"She smells good, no?\" Ling asked us\
  \ cheekily. Our small group of 5 laughed. \"No Ling, she smells distinctly like\
  \ gone off figgy pudding\". We had been trekking through Gunung Leuser National\
  \ Park (aka dense, musty jungle) for 8 hours. Why we thought she was the one that\
  \ smelled bad is beyond me now. \nShe was curious, confident and shy all at the\
  \ same time. It was strange to see this display of human emotions unfold from her\
  \ spiked brow, through her inky eyes, stretching out from her puckered lips. She\
  \ skillfully moved my partner from one position to another; an eager eye on our\
  \ picnic fruit salad and the other, somewhat warily, on me. I knew my place. Eventually,\
  \ she got to the fruit and their brief intimate encounter ended with a couple of\
  \ smooches from Jackie and one last ear-suckle from Baby. \nWhen Jackie and co decided\
  \ to bid us adieu, we sat, a little speechless, in a close-knit circle under a canopy\
  \ of 50 meter-high Tualang trees. The jungle buzzed and hummed around us. A Macaque\
  \ monkey nosed around the periphery, hoping to grab a morsel (or two) of our mid-afternoon\
  \ lunch; sweet and tangy Nasi Goreng (fried rice) wrapped in spinach-green jungle\
  \ leaves. A variety of monkeys, including Brown and White Gibbons, Thomas's Langur\
  \ and Surili's swung over our heads, competing for the best branches, with the most\
  \ fruit. The chaotic yet coordinated adventures of this flexible lot put my tired\
  \ legs to shame. This adventure could not end, but it also could not end soon enough.\
  \  That's what they don't tell you when you read about the most incredible jungle\
  \ treks in the world. Mostly it is trembly legs and a mixed bag of adrenaline, which\
  \ can let you down when you are climbing your 5th peak of the day. Anyway, there's\
  \ no harm in taking a break. \nIn a few hours, we would reach the Leuser river,\
  \ where we would camp overnight. We would play magic tricks and brain teasers with\
  \ Ling under cover of an epic rainstorm.  That day we walked 12 km 'as the crow\
  \ flies'. The last thing I expected was to compete for my boyfriend's attention\
  \ with a doppelganger, equally-sized Orangutan. But these moments, they catch you\
  \ by surprise. They make traveling, meeting new faces and places, intrinsic to living."
