  I delayed the feeling of disappointment by wondering why Gaston, the owner of the\
  \ hostel I was staying at, kept calling me Ricardo. Did he find it amusing or think\
  \ it was endearing?\n\nThis musing lasted only a second as the rest of his sentence\
  \ hit me. 3 days ago I\u2019d flown into Buenos Aires and gotten onto a bus heading\
  \ south. 20 hours later I\u2019d arrived into the small town of Puerto Madryn, famous\
  \ for its nearby nature reserves. But to do that the bus had to edge its way through\
  \ the unexpected downpours that had enclosed upon the region. As such the dirt roads\
  \ to Peninsula Valdes and Punta Tombo were closed.\n\nThere\u2019s always the risk\
  \ as a solo traveler of getting stuck somewhere with nothing much to do. I was just\
  \ hoping it wouldn\u2019t be the first few days of my eagerly anticipated adventure.\
  \ This particular morning the sun was out and I was full of hope as I walked down\
  \ the uneven steps of the hostel. After being met with the negative news I braced\
  \ myself for another day of being sat on the beach with my book.\n\nAs I went to\
  \ leave the hostel I met a young woman who was sat on the faded coach next to the\
  \ entrance, also with a book in hand. I greeted her with my limited Spanish, trying\
  \ hard to minimize the twang of my Geordie accent. It became clear very quickly\
  \ that whilst I had almost no Spanish, she had even less English.\n\n\u201CMi nombre\
  \ es Richard\u201D\n\n\u201CQue?\u201D\n\n\u201CRichard\u201D\n\nA strange rumbling\
  \ sound came from her mouth that I was pretty sure was nothing like what I\u2019\
  d just said. Was the name a problem?\n\n\u201CRicardo\u201D\n\n\u201CAh Ricardo\u201D\
  . She beamed at me.\n\nTo get both names had taken over ten minutes. Feeling greatly\
  \ embarrassed at my appalling language skills I motioned with my fingers that I\
  \ was going for a walk, pointed in the direction of the beach, and said my goodbyes.\
  \ Minutes later I was stood on what was effectively the promenade deciding where\
  \ to go, when I hear footsteps behind me.\n\nWhat followed was amongst the most\
  \ fun days of the trip. With no internet access our combined translation skills\
  \ amounted to a pocket guide to Spanish. It is amazing how much can be implied through\
  \ pointing at words on a page, drawing pictures in the sand, and animated body language.\
  \ A walk turned into dinner at her favourite restaurant, where I first sampled Argentinean\
  \ red wine and later on, empanadas at a back alley bakery, where they were made\
  \ in front of you by the cheeriest of locals.\n\nTravelling is nothing if not unpredictable."
