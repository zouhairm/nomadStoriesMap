Text: "Areopagus Hill, where Ares was tried for killing Poseidon\u2019s son and St.\
  \ Paul spoke about \u201Cthe Unknown God\u201D is just outside the Acropolis exit.\
  \ The sounds of protests on the streets below reverberate against the rocky tor\
  \ as I descend the north stairs. President Erdogan of Turkey is arriving in Athens\
  \ tomorrow for the first visit by a Turkish head of state to Greece in 65 years.\
  \ He announced today that he wants to discuss a reassessment of the Greece/Turkey\
  \ border established by the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923, leaving the Greeks all warm\
  \ & fuzzy in anticipation. \nThe staircase deposits me right above the Roman Agora.\
  \ The site is already closed but is easily seen in its entirety from this viewpoint.\
  \ I am accosted by a guy named Patrick allegedly from Kenya offering me blessings\
  \ and Hakuna Matata. I tell him I have no money but he insists on putting a woven\
  \ bracelet on my wrist, pets my hand and recites an unintelligible contrived prayer.\
  \ He asks me again for whatever support I can provide. When I reiterate my refusal\
  \ he takes the bracelet back. Yeah, Hakuna Matata to you, too. \nIt is a short walk\
  \ from here to the Monastiraki district, a cute area with lots of little shops and\
  \ plenty of restaurants. I pick one offering traditional Greek food and order a\
  \ kebab plate with yogurt, pita and tomato sauce served open-faced, requiring a\
  \ forkand knife. Unfortunately there are beggars everywhere in Athens and you can\u2019\
  t eat a meal in peace without at least five beggars coming to your table looking\
  \ for a handout, interrupting what could have been a very pleasant dining experience.\
  \ Note to self \u2013 eat inside. Another Kenyan guy named Austin accosts me and\
  \ I tell him his buddy Patrick already gave me the blessing. He doesn\u2019t know\
  \ Patrick (what a surprise) and insists on showing me his skill at making the bracelets.\
  \ The conversation goes like this:\nA: Anything you can give\nMe: Sorry, only have\
  \ a credit card\nA: I take credit cards\nMe: OK, where\u2019s your machine. I\u2019\
  ll give you something\nA: (pulling out his iPhone) You want to see my credit card\
  \ machine? \nMe: Sure\nA: (laughing) Only kidding. I wanted to see your reaction\n\
  Me: I knew you couldn\u2019t possibly accept credit cards because if you could afford\
  \ a phone that could, no one would ever give you money. You have an iPhone. You\
  \ don\u2019t need money\nA: (frowning) I can go with you to the bank and you can\
  \ get money from your credit card \nMe: That\u2019s not happening\nA: Want to go\
  \ with me to a party tonight? \nMe: No"
