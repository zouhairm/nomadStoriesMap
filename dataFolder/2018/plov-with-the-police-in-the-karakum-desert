Text: "As a middle class Brit from real life Hobbiton, I've been brought up to trust\
  \ the police at all times.  Unfortunately, this world view can get you in trouble\
  \ when visiting a totalitarian regime, above all ex-soviet, still-crazy Turkmenistan.\n\
  \nThe country has a lot to offer the bold adventurer not put off by onerous visa\
  \ requirements.  Principally, it's own catastrophic world wonder in the form of\
  \ the Darvaza Gas Crater, permanently ablaze and known as the Gates to Hell. \n\n\
  A visa and a pigeon Russian explanation to a taxi driver later, we set off into\
  \ the desert on our search for the crater.  Police check points every hour along\
  \ the roads soon became a benign norm to us.  The driver answered some questions,\
  \ waved some papers and we continued on our merry way.  Then at one check point\
  \ a large and meaty policeman broke protocol and summoned us out of the car.\n\n\
  \u201CPhoto! Photo!\u201D he said excitedly to us in English. \u201CPhoto! Photo!\u201D\
  \n\nOnce he realised I understood a bit of Russian, he explained, \u201Cyou've come\
  \ to take photos of the gas crater!  But it's going to be expensive.\u201D\n\nMy\
  \ stomach did a flip flop.  Expensive?  I was a barely employed budget traveller,\
  \ I didn't do expensive!  I suggested that we could just walk to the crater.\n\n\
  \u201CWalk?\u201D he scoffed, \u201CIt's too far! Five kilometres!  You need to\
  \ hire a jeep.  It's going to be expensive.  I'll take you to where you need to\
  \ go.\u201D  Before we could think of a polite refusal, he ushered us inside his\
  \ car.\n\nMany thoughts flew through my mind as he slammed the door shut - am I\
  \ being arrested? Does he want a bribe?  What's the phone number for the British\
  \ embassy?  \n\nI didn't have much time to panic as he soon stopped outside a wooden\
  \ shack that turned out to be a family house.  The policeman embraced the man of\
  \ the shack, and then we all sat down for a stodgy rice and meat lunch of plov.\
  \ \n\nWe discussed many topics: family, expensive jeeps, Russian colonialism.  All\
  \ the while, we tried to enjoy our plov while not being put off by the flies buzzing\
  \ around the table.  We felt trapped.  We needed to escape this pushy policeman,\
  \ but how?\n\n\u201CWell, I've got to go and do police things,\u201D he said, eventually\
  \ getting to his feet, \u201CStay here, and I'll be back in an hour.\u201D\n\nFinally\
  \ free of the policeman, the man of the shack gave us directions to the crater.\
  \  Just as the sun began to set, we strode into the Karakum desert.  Here authority\
  \ could not follow us (unless they rented an expensive jeep)."
