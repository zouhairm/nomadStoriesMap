Text: "Have you ever been in a situation where you need to push through your fears?\n\
  \nOne of the fondest memory that I have of Todra Gorge in Morocco is a climb that\
  \ me and my fiance Andres did during our holiday in December.\n\nThe day we decided\
  \ to climb our first multi-pitch, a climb that requires multiple stops to get to\
  \ the top, it was very sunny and the rock looked gorgeous from the bottom. The climb\
  \ was easy and we left the ground confident that everything would go well and that\
  \ it would be a great experience to practice our new skills.\n\nClimbing in Todra\
  \ Gorge feels very different than anywhere else: the rock is sharp and painful under\
  \ your fingertips, but it also offers amazing grip, and the climbing style is technical\
  \ and pleasant, offering a breathtaking view of the Gorge.\n\nHigh up the 3rd pitch,\
  \ more than 100 meters up, I could see our friends as spots of colours moving around\
  \ the other climbs in the area, when I heard Andres screaming my name. I looked\
  \ up to him standing on a ledge about 15 meters above me, not being able to move\
  \ because the rope was stuck between 2 boulders.\n\nWhen he had clipped to the bolt\
  \ near him, we tried to shuffle the rope, hoping that it could come out from the\
  \ crack it had ended up in. After a few attempts, it was clear that there was nothing\
  \ we could do and that we had to take an unpleasant and definitely risky decision:\
  \ one of us had to leave their safety station and reach for the point where the\
  \ rope was stuck.\n\nIt is known that down-climbing is always harder and more dangerous\
  \ than climbing up, so the only option was for me to do it. I had fought against\
  \ my fear of falling for months and Andres didn\u2019t want to put me at risk so\
  \ he was frantically thinking of a solution that would avoid having me climbing\
  \ up without being secured. With both mine and his surprise though, I didn\u2019\
  t blink once and offered myself to go.\n\nI untied my safety rope and climbed up\
  \ the rock face, careful not to misplace my steps. When I could reach the rope,\
  \ holding myself on a small crimp with one hand, I gave a couple of good shuffles\
  \ and managed to free it. I sat climbed up a few more meters, to a little ledge\
  \ near the second bolt, where I clipped myself, to allow Andres to finish the climb\
  \ and get to the top.\n\nBack onto belaying, waiting for him to build our last station\
  \ before abseiling down, I looked up to the sun setting above the mountains in front\
  \ of us, and I smiled.\n\nFor the first time in months, I felt brave and strong.\
  \ I felt alive."
