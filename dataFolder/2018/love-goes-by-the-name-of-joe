Text: "I had just left college, and I knew so little about where I was going or what\
  \ I wanted in life. The only things I knew with certainty, were that I had a one-way\
  \ ticket to Kauai, and a determination to discover something - anything. \nAfter\
  \ a couple weeks of adjusting to a semi-permanent feeling of vacation, I decided\
  \ to get a job. This wasn't the hard part. Almost immediately, I was working at\
  \ a bikini shop called Aloha Swim. I laugh about this now, because at the time I\
  \ didn't realize I was living out a clich\xE9.\nI worked there for just over a month,\
  \ but it was one I'll never forget. It was in just 20 minutes of that month that\
  \ I met Joe, a local man who changed my perspective forever. \nJoe was a homeless\
  \ man who lived on the beach in a small shelter made of tarp. I first met him when\
  \ he came in one day to the shop. He wasn't looking for a bathing suit, or in fact,\
  \ anything else we sold. I won't deny that my first impression of him wasn't a great\
  \ one. I only ever worked in the shop alone, so of course my thoughts immediately\
  \ flew to my safety. He didn't appear menacing in any way, nor was he holding anything\
  \ dangerous but a hot cup of drip from the Starbucks next door, and I knew if anything\
  \ were to happen, the neighboring shops would more than likely hear me yell. But\
  \ old prejudices don't just go away because logic intercedes. \n\"Hi, welcome in.\"\
  \ I said to him, but he seemed a bit more interested in the scaffolding. I stared\
  \ at him for a few seconds, which he seemed to notice with about as much speed as\
  \ he was using to walk around: very little. Finally, he met my eyes, and I knew\
  \ in that moment he wasn't going to be any trouble. He had the eyes of a weather-beaten\
  \ sailor with a smile as toothless and kind as the sky is starry and beautiful.\
  \ \n\"Hello! You're new!\" He said. \n\"Yes, I just started last week.\" I replied.\
  \ \nWe continued to talk about all the \"this's\" and \"that's\" for what seemed\
  \ like a moment as well as eternity. He was on his way out the door, broken sandals,\
  \ matted hair and all, when I thought to ask him his name. \n\"Well, it's Joe, and\
  \ I live down on the beach if you're ever wantin' a chat.\" He winked and smiled\
  \ and was gone.\nJust like that I learned the meaning of love. Love isn't a miracle\
  \ bestowed only upon the very lucky few, nor is it a commodity you have to earn.\
  \ Love personified, is a gentle old man living on the beach, ready to strike up\
  \ an uplifting conversation with any passersby.\nOn the Island of Kauai, love goes\
  \ by the name of Joe."
