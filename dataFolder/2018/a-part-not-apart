Text: "I cheered along with the rest of the bar as Rivas won the Baseball championship.\
  \ While I wasn\u2019t particularly invested, the mood was infectious. I had come\
  \ to Iguana\u2019s, a three storey, open air, wooden beach bar, to enjoy an ice\
  \ cold Cuba Libre and the blissful ocean breeze that beat off the sticky heat. Reggaeton\
  \ and Justin Bieber were the regular beats of the bar, but tonight it was almost\
  \ impossible to hear any music over the commotion of the Baseball final.\nI had\
  \ arrived in Nicaragua three weeks earlier and was living with a local family. The\
  \ structure of the house was such that the only real common area was the front porch.\
  \ It boasted rocking chairs and a red tiled floor, and was everyone\u2019s favoured\
  \ space as it had the luxury of a blissful breeze.\nThat night Naomi, my host brother\u2019\
  s wife and I had escaped the madness that was the front porch, as the family and\
  \ neighbours gathered on it, with an eclectic mix of chairs, plates of Gallo Pinto\
  \ and cold To\xF1a\u2019s. Neither myself nor Naomi, (who originated from London),\
  \ had much interest in Nicaragua\u2019s national sport, even though the team our\
  \ town supported was in the finals. \nShortly after the result, Naomi\u2019s phone\
  \ rang.\n\u201CWhat?\u201D Naomi\u2019s eyes bulged. \u201CYou\u2019ve done what?\
  \ When?\u201D Hanging up the phone she looked at me. \u201CCarlos has rented a car\
  \ and the family are driving to Rivas in the next half hour to celebrate. There\u2019\
  s going to be a massive street party. Wanna go?\u201D\n \nOn any normal day in Rivas,\
  \ you might expect a little traffic, perhaps a few cattle or goats tied to the side\
  \ of the road, but nothing to really draw you in. It\u2019s a town you pass through\
  \ to get to other, more exciting locations. That night however, Rivas was buzzing.\
  \ The first thing I noticed as 9 of us piled out of the car was the atmosphere.\
  \ It was electric and contagious. Cars were crammed along the sides of the road\
  \ or parked in Petrol Stations. The whole area was heaving with people, even the\
  \ street kids of San Juan had somehow made it! People had their car doors flung\
  \ wide open and each one blared a different Reggaeton song. The entire crowd (ourselves\
  \ included) drank homemade Cuba Libres. \n \nIt took me a while to realise I was\
  \ the only white person in the entire crowd of this impromptu street party. I was\
  \ aware I was an outsider in this sea of people. \u201CSmile!\u201D Naomi nudged\
  \ me as we took yet another family photo. And I did, because I was a part of the\
  \ family too."
