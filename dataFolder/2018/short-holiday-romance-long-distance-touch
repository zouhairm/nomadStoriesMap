Text: "I recently went to the Philippine's to see my best friend working as a project\
  \ manager on a construction site. \n\nI had been speaking to a girl from a dating\
  \ site before I left London so I was building a local connection already and I hadn't\
  \ even touched my feet on the Filipino land!\n\nShe was asking intelligent questions\
  \ about me and why I wanted to visit. She also said:\n\n\"Why are you coming here?\
  \ \"To which I replied \"I'm coming to meet you!\"\n\nIn the general sense of things\
  \ I was there to meet anyone who I can treat like I would like to be treated. In\
  \ figures, I had 500 matches and roughly 100 conversations which went nowhere apart\
  \ from Mara's.\n\nWhat I thought would be a nice walk around an old fort area called\
  \ \"Intramuros\" by Manila's Pasig river turned into a full blown holiday romance\
  \ for several days. Safe to say a local connection was very successful. This doesn't\
  \ always happen in such a short period of time but our personalities matched and\
  \ we're still in touch since I left.\n\nIntramuros has a lot of Spanish history\
  \ and architecture, a grid like compound with local cooking overshadowed by Western\
  \ fast foods and churches. This was a very pleasant day and being shown around by\
  \ a local I was shown Plaza Moriones, a little garden which I hadn't visually seen\
  \ on google earth!\n\nDue to the success of our day we invited her friend out with\
  \ my friend to the usual live music bar in Makati and to our disbelief both girls\
  \ got up and sang for us on stage. \"Evanescence - Bring me to life\" was definitely\
  \ making my heart beat faster for this girl. This has always been one of my favourite\
  \ songs. We danced the night away after this spectacle. \n\nI never really get experiences\
  \ like this in England which makes me think whether I really enjoy England or whether\
  \ I should travel around the world and find where fits me!\n\nA day or two later\
  \ Mara and I ended up in Venice... Venice in Manila that is. Overshadowed by tower\
  \ blocks with fresh brand new Hollywood movie type looking buildings which are safe\
  \ from drowning, it was quite a laugh. I have been to the real Venice so I wasn't\
  \ pretending to be impressed, but it was romantic and another great thing having\
  \ a local connection because I didn't see this on trip advisor either....\n\nTo\
  \ conclude this adventure which only lasted 9 days in the city Manila, that feeling\
  \ of being sent off at the airport by Mara was really hard, harder than leaving\
  \ my best friend to be honest, but life is all about feeling things and experiencing\
  \ things."
