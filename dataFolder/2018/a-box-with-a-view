Text: "When I put the VIP sticker upon my shirt, perhaps I did so with some hubris.\
  \ \n\nWe\u2019d just endured a rough eight-hour van ride through Northern Thailand,\
  \ and Luang Prabang was one, presumably smooth, 12-hour VIP bus ride away.\n\nThose\
  \ 12 hours are in contention for the longest of my life.\n\nFrom the outside, the\
  \ bus appeared to match the one advertised by the tourist agency, but its interior\
  \ concealed a secret that would soon fill me with claustrophobic dread.\n\nInstead\
  \ of seats, the bus was filled with upper and lower bunks, each layered with mattresses\
  \ no thicker than a paperback novel. The ceiling loomed unbearably low, leaving\
  \ little room for anything but lying down. It was not until I saw a Laotian man\
  \ casually squeeze into another man\u2019s bunk that I realized these quarters were\
  \ made for two people. While I was, luckily, traveling with my girlfriend, a French\
  \ traveler was shocked to learn that he\u2019d be lying shoulder to shoulder with\
  \ a complete stranger.\n\nThere was no shying away from this experience, no phone\
  \ signal to pass the time, and a window so narrow it only allowed glimpses of bare\
  \ night sky and the occasional treetop. The narrow lying space and unyielding cold\
  \ breath of the air conditioner was one step away from what I imagined lying inside\
  \ a coffin would feel like. \n\nEscape through sleep was also not an option; even\
  \ the small comfort of darkness was stripped away hourly by an onslaught of fluorescent\
  \ lights that signalled each bathroom stop.  For all of my internal struggle, the\
  \ local passengers were, inversely, relaxed. \n\nTen hours later panic welled up\
  \ inside of me. I could only lay in one position for so long. Even worse, I was\
  \ freezing to death. No combination of knob twists allowed me to shut the air off.\
  \ I tried covering the vent with a number of objects to no avail. \n\nI looked up\
  \ in desperation and discovered a VIP entry sticker stuck to the ceiling. The sticker\
  \ felt like a message from the previous rider:\n\n\u201CUse this, and survive.\u201D\
  \n\nCombined with the stickers on our shirts, we somehow MacGyvered a solution,\
  \ pinning down the side curtain over the vent, keeping the cold wind at bay. \n\n\
  After what seemed an eternity, we finally made it to Luang Prabang.\n\nI never imagined\
  \ a VIP service would test my mental fortitude. While the experience would not,\
  \ by most western definitions, fit the term VIP, it reminded me of my own privilege\
  \ as a traveler, and the sometimes agonizing struggle one must undergo to expand\
  \ that definition."
