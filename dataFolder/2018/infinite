Text: "The noble truth in the sun ceased to exist for a slight second when I first\
  \ approached the beauty that is Vancouver. The streets raced without even a breathe,\
  \ I first arrived there when the sun was just rising.\nI walked around no doubt\
  \ looking like a lost tourist searching for something that I just couldn\u2019t\
  \ find but in the unknown I thrived only consumed by wonder.\nI walked straight\
  \ into an early morning gathering of people selling fruits, on the other side of\
  \ the  cracked streetlight there was a stage booming with the vicious guitar of\
  \ some unknown band.\nIt was slowly but surely becoming busier and busier the streets\
  \ now were over flooded with people looking straight down, in the madness of rush\
  \ hour I walked around appreciating the beauty in the neon signs, in the sidewalk\
  \ trees all of this and more captured me fully.\nI went to the Capilano Suspension\
  \ Bridge that I had heard so much about but nothing could have prepared me for what\
  \ I experienced.\nI got to the bridge around 3:00 pm while the weather was at a\
  \ perfect division between hot and cold, when I first saw the bridge it took me\
  \ for a ride, all around trees surrounded me, the clouds puffed out with vivid pictures\
  \ that made me stop and enjoy the moment that was the now. I crossed the bridge\
  \ feeling a sonic sensation that kept my mouth quiet and my mind toss and turn.\n\
  Beyond the bridge was the most surreal, everywhere you looked girls passed smiling\
  \ with flowers in their hair, men played their out of tune guitars, old couples\
  \ held each other close and in the distance a man sat meditating. \nI sat by a Monk\
  \ and he told me the most important thing you can ever do in your life is to Be\
  \ Here Now.\nThose words \u201CBe Here Now\u201D rang in my ears.\nI now saw it\
  \ all, the meaning, the purpose, everything at that moment melted into a great big\
  \ nothingness.\nI felt a joy that I had only glimpsed at before, the Buddhists and\
  \ the Catholics shared a water bottle without any troubling thoughts.\nOn a tree\
  \ were carved the words \u201CWe are all one\u201D with a heart and a star carved\
  \ next to it.\nThe girl with black hair and a dark blue bandanna blew a dandelion\
  \ and the little pieces spread across the field and beyond the seeable trees.\n\
  I stayed there for hours, by the time I left the stars had pierced the night sky\
  \ and at that moment I felt Infinite, just purely infinite. \nI felt I was the universe\
  \ in it\u2019s slumps and it\u2019s peaks through the warm and the cold I was there\
  \ holding the stars at elbow and foot."
