Text: "\u201CSee?\u201D. She put the Arcana XV under the Arcana XX: the three figures\
  \ of The Judgment (a man, a woman and a misterious blue character taking from behind)\
  \ were completed by the Devil, also totally blue, and its two little assistants.\
  \ The two cards matched perfectly, as if the first one had only waited for its bottom\
  \ part. \u201CYou are looking for your feet\u201D, she said. \n\nIt was by an accident:\
  \ I took the map and choosed a destination only for its name \u2013 Santa Gertrudiz\
  \ Miramar. Finally, a place that really looks at the sea. No restaurants, no vegan\
  \ bars, no all-inclusive day-trip to see the turtles copulating on the surface of\
  \ water. But when I jump off the colectivo, I realized that the pueblo was separated\
  \ from the beach by a ten kilometres road coasting down an enormous, superbe hill.\
  \ I was about to ask something when the taxi disappeared, leaving me in front of\
  \ my brand new house.\n\nMy hosts were pretty famous there: Monica, the pater familias,\
  \ was a two-meters indigenous woman that did everything a man can do, and also what\
  \ a man cannot; Chana, her girlfriend, was the only fisherwoman in the entire coast,\
  \ and even when she misteriously got pregnant, people saw her escaping in the night\
  \ to go empty the net; and then there were Javi, Monica\u2019s son, and a huge number\
  \ of hunts and cousins who appeared only at dawn to drink caf\xE9 de olla. Even\
  \ if everybody gossiped about Monica and her family, anyone could do nothing but\
  \ respect her because \u2013 they said \u2013 she was strong like a man.\n\n\u201C\
  Already tired?\u201D. I have worked like a dog for days: waking up at dawn, sweeping\
  \ the sand floor, taking water from the swell, helping in the kitchen, eating their\
  \ food, drinking their beer and, hardest of them all, watching their tv series.\
  \ No way. There was always the same question: ya te cansaste? But I was determinated\
  \ to be part of the family. So, when Monica ask me to go choop wood, I did not think\
  \ about it twice.\n\nWe went up the superbe hill. She kept making fun of me, but\
  \ I wasn\u2019t listening: I couldn\u2019t stop looking at her, like an ancient\
  \ diosa doing miracles. Mankind has to imitate divinity, so I also started to cut\
  \ trees; but since a man is only a man, I cut my shoe instead. She got scared like\
  \ a baby. While she was medicating me, she told me a story about the spirit that\
  \ protects the hill, the one everyone has to ask for permission before cutting.\
  \ \u201CAnd what is the name of the spirit?\u201D, I ask distractly. \u201CSome\
  \ people call it El Amigo\u201D, she said. \u201CBut his name is El Diablo\u201D\
