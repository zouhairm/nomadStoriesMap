Text: "Kike brought up the link and stared at the picture for a minute, tilting his\
  \ head slightly one way before biting his lip and tilting it the other. Rembrandt,\
  \ he said. He was my dad's favourite painter. It's going to be hard like that, you,\
  \ know. You want it like that? It won't look the same. It's a painting. This is\
  \ a tattoo. What are they called, he said, moving his hand like painter with a brush.\
  \ They're not going to be the same.\n\nKike sat me down and got going in silence\
  \ but before long he looked up and asked about his English. It was good I told him\
  \ and I asked where he'd learnt it.\n\nI picked it up in Canada, he said. I worked\
  \ there for four years. You get paid much better there than you do here. It's why\
  \ I went. Save up money so that I could set up this shop and make a better life\
  \ for my wife and kids. I got two boys, six and four, and it's tough here, you know,\
  \ if you live in the wrong barrio.\n\nI told him I had family here in Lima and where\
  \ they lived. \n\nYou smell the smell of burning rubber at night? he asked. It's\
  \ fucked up. You know what that is? Fuckers smoking crack. \n\nHow come you didn't\
  \ stay in Canada? I asked.\n\nMan, it's cold there. And I didn't have my family.\
  \ My wife and boys weren't allowed to go. Canada didn't want to give them a visa,\
  \ you know, they see a young family from here, my wife pregnant, and they think\
  \ all we want is to escape our country. All they see is this shit, the drugs, the\
  \ police taking money, the people hungry. They think we want out.\n\nI love my country,\
  \ he said. She's beautiful. I want to live here but, you know, in a better place.\
  \ Now I live here, in Miraflores. I worked long fucking hours to get here. To get\
  \ a flat and this shop. I was always coming back. And now I'm here, I get to be\
  \ with my boys.\n\nKike wiped my arm and went over a couple of lines. He sat back\
  \ on his stool and surveyed what he'd done so far. I think we can finish this today,\
  \ he said. But let's eat. You hungry? I'm hungry. You like burgers? We'll get burgers\
  \ delivered.\n\nWe ate lunch and two hours later Kike finished the tattoo. He cleaned\
  \ up my arm, swabbed some Bepanthen over the tattoo and wrapped it up. You got Bepanthen,\
  \ he asked? No problem, I'll take you the pharmacy. And if you want, I'll show you\
  \ mi barrio. There's some dope antique shops around here. This is the nice part\
  \ of town."
