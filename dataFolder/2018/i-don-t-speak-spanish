Text: "After taking night classes in Spanish for a year, I was finally on the plane.\
  \ I promised myself to speak only Spanish during this holiday. I would become fluent\
  \ so quickly! And so easily!\n\nI used the 30 hour journey to study \u2013 cramming\
  \ vocabulary into my head just as I was crammed into the economy class seat, and\
  \ sprawled myself and my notes across airport floors around the globe.\n\nFull of\
  \ confidence on my first day in Buenos Aires, I strode into the corner caf\xE9 \u2013\
  \ full of crossaints, hot chocolates, and soon, memories of my first real Spanish\
  \ conversation. I mangled my words until the barista said, \u201CEnglish is ok!\u201D\
  \ So I spoke English. I had my coffee in hand and all it cost me was 20 pesos and\
  \ a little piece of my confidence in speaking Spanish.\n\nArriving at a guesthouse\
  \ in Montevideo, taking in the ornate staircase and gorgeous chandelier, I struggled\
  \ to tell the manager how beautiful the building is. We quickly reverted to talking\
  \ only in hand gestures. I walked the cobblestone streets, my surety of my speaking\
  \ abilities fading with every step.\n\nFailing to buy a slice of pizza in Havana\
  \ confirmed to me that my knowledge of Spanish would stay locked in textbooks.\n\
  \nI was at a farmhouse in Colombia, perched atop a mountain. I could watch the morning\
  \ sunrise peeking through the mist from one side, and watch the sunset over the\
  \ opposite mountains. In between, my days were spent hiking in the mountains, reading\
  \ books about South American history (my faithful textbooks, the only way I could\
  \ connect with these places), and many hours spent hanging out with the household\
  \ cat, and walking with the neighbours\u2019 dogs. My host Gloria and I got along\
  \ perfectly well using hand signals, but for the cat and dogs, language barriers\
  \ were not an issue as we explored the rolling hills together.\n\nAt dusk, the temperature\
  \ dropping outside, I am safely ensconced in the farmhouse, by the crackling fire,\
  \ with my book. I glimpse the cat out of the corner of my eye and, reaching down\
  \ to him, I hear the flapping of wings \u2013 this is not my cat, but a bat, inches\
  \ from my outreached hand. \u201CPELIGROSO! Danger!\u201D I scream. I don\u2019\
  t have time to think about the words. \u201CAyudame, Gloria! Help me!\u201D Then,\
  \ louder, \u201CVen rapido, mira eso! Come quickly, look at this!\u201D\nFrantically\
  \ chasing and shouting, and we were rid of the bat.\n\nLaughing, catching our breath,\
  \ collapsing by the fire as the last rays of the sun touch the mountain, Gloria\
  \ turns to me. \u201CYou never told me you speak Spanish?\u201D"
