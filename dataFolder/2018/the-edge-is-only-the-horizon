Text: "I read about Dominica in a magazine. The new Waitukubli Trail that stretches\
  \ from the southernmost tip to the northern part of the island, 110 miles that traversed\
  \ mountains, rivers, sulfur springs, volcanic lakes, with ocean views.  At the end\
  \ of the article there was a simple question, if Dominica builds it, will anyone\
  \ come?\n There were a thousand reasons why I shouldn\u2019t gone: My husband and\
  \ I had only been to one foreign country staying at an all-inclusive; we only hiked\
  \ a max of 40 miles in a straight shot; we didn\u2019t even have legit hiking packs\
  \ and were in $100,000 of student loan debt. But I couldn\u2019t let it go. I carried\
  \ the article with me to bed, to work the next day, back to bed until I finally\
  \ worked up the courage to say here, read this. And he said, yes.\n That was in\
  \ February. Rainy season starts in May. So in less than two months after hearing\
  \ the name Dominica, we were on a plane watching it rise out of the water like both\
  \ a monster and a savior.  I was terrified, but I took comfort in that the only\
  \ wild animals that could kill me were boa constrictors, the country had recently\
  \ been voted the friendliest in the world, and when I Googled murders in Dominica\
  \ nothing came up.  See, we had no money (thank you college loans), barely enough\
  \ to cover flights and essentials, so we planned on sleeping in hammocks along the\
  \ trail for rest of the week.\n Hiking in Dominica was like being dropped into a\
  \ dream.  The trees were like what I read about in fairy tales, if I looked hard\
  \ enough I swore they had faces.  The vines were like long arms dangling from rock\
  \ ledges over waterfalls.  The flowers were bright and the birds plentiful.  But\
  \ hiking in Dominica was also a nightmare.  The mountains were steep and long. \
  \ The trees were dense.  In a hammock, in a wild, new land, in a severely dark night,\
  \ coconuts crashed from trees into the undergrowth and sounded like a monster running\
  \ toward me, coming to rip me from my slumber.  But we learned, and we trusted,\
  \ and we woke with the sun.  \n Dominica is a constant adventure. You meet rivers\
  \ with no bridges.  Towns with the best fried chicken. Mountains that appear to\
  \ touch the sky.  There wasn\u2019t one part of my decision to hike Dominica that\
  \ pushed me to the edge, it was the whole decision in itself to get out there and\
  \ live.  What I learned from Dominica is that all decisions have the power to push\
  \ you to the edge, and the edge is only the horizon."
