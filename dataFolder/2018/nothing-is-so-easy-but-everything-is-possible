Text: "The day before yesterday, my surf ran into the pink board of Flora Christin,\
  \ one of the best longboard riders on the Bali island.\n\nShe is short, and weighs\
  \ no more than 50 kilos. She seems more swarthy when wearing a white swimsuit. The\
  \ surf carries her along the waves, and Flora steps back and forth on her huge pink\
  \ board. She dances on the longboard, which is twice as big as her, as if she has\
  \ tamed the ocean. It looks as if she knows its secret, and therefore the ocean\
  \ has never hurt her.\n\nEveryday for the last year she has been surfing in Batu\
  \ Bolong, the most crowded surf beach on Bali. I had been watching her from Oldman\u2019\
  s beach restaurant for three months. And I had really wanted to get to know her.\n\
  \nYay, fate had found the way for it. And it was terrible.\n\nAfter the collision,\
  \ we both went under water. At that moment I thought it was time to pack my suitcase\
  \ to Moscow.\n\nBut everything worked out. And after we met for a reconciliation\
  \ breakfast. And I asked her something I had long wanted to know about.\n\n- You\
  \ must have been surfing for 20 years already?\n- No, for two years. (She laughs).\n\
  \nShe comes from Sumatra, and used to live in Jakarta. Two years ago Flora quit\
  \ her job in DHL and moved to Bali. She was responsible for HR in the company. Now\
  \ she is 27.  So, she began surfing only at 25. At that time she could not even\
  \ swim.\n\nBack then there were no girls speaking bahasa on the waves of Bali. She\
  \ never studied how to surf. Her family still does not approve of her lifestyle.\
  \ Because Indonesian women are supposed to do other things. \n\nWomen \u0441ook\
  \ curry, plant and harvest rice and prepare offerings  for the Gods three times\
  \ a day. They make baskets out of palm leaves, fill them with fruit pieces, flowers\
  \ and incense sticks. They moisten their ankles In the ocean at most, because  they\
  \ are afraid to disturb the Gods living in the water.\n\n\"I watched the video on\
  \ YouTube,\" \"I watched others surf. I really wanted it to do it too. I tried everything\
  \ myself. Day after day. Boy surfers laughed at me. But soon they stopped. \"\n\n\
  I look at her. She is so fragile and brave.\n\n\"Nothing is so easy, but everything\
  \ is possible\", - continues. When you look at her, you believe it."
