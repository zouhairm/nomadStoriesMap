Text: "I felt trepidation as I stared at the grooved slabs of steel folding over each\
  \ other, making their way up the hillside. I was white and I was wrong to assume\
  \ that mattered. I was in the city of eternal spring.  Before today, Colombia conjured\
  \ up thoughts of salsa dancing, cocaine, and lush green landscapes. Instead, I was\
  \ in awe of an escalator. There are six of these escalators outside in a hillside\
  \ neighborhood on the outskirts of Medellin.\n \nThe architecture hasn\u2019t progressed\
  \ in decades, but the civil engineering is futuristic. The staggered spacing made\
  \ it seem these escalators were dropped from the sky amid the pastel stacks of cinder\
  \ block houses with metal roofs. These ramps invited me up through Comuna 13, previously\
  \ one of the most dangerous neighborhoods in Medellin. This was a war zone just\
  \ a decade previous. \u201CWould it be safe?\u201D I thought.\n \nBefore reaching\
  \ the escalators, a cable car from the furthest north metro station and a short\
  \ bus ride is necessary just to reach the neighborhood. Once there, the neighborhood\
  \ gains elevation at a fast pace.  I couldn\u2019t help thinking how difficult a\
  \ walk this would be to the city center for the residents. Six separate escalators\
  \ guide you through the maze of dwellings. The top of each had an intensely colorful\
  \ graffiti mural, most depicting various symbols of strength; the head of a roaring\
  \ tiger, a young boy pushing up a sleeve to expose a flexed bicep. Uniformed Colombian\
  \ police greeted me as I finally reached the top.\n \nSomething seemed missing on\
  \ the way up. There was a distinct cleanliness and lack of trash.  A woman selling\
  \ beaded necklaces and homemade perfumes at the top explained. This was due to what\
  \ all this means to the people. The grand view from up high is exactly what choked\
  \ it off from the city, inviting criminals. To the people here, freedom from intimidation,\
  \ fear, and violence is paramount. Such freedom is new here and is largely due to\
  \ improved transportation. These escalators represent freedom. They are a reminder\
  \ to these people they are not left behind by a growing metropolis eager to shed\
  \ its past. They represent a community leaving no one behind.\n \nThe top is what\
  \ you would expect, a poor neighborhood. I felt welcome by smiles and conversation.\
  \ For many in Comuna 13, this freedom takes them from being a statistic to being\
  \ able to provide for their family. Maybe I wasn\u2019t crazy taking time away from\
  \ the surrounding beauty to look at the power of ingenuity to change lives."
