Text: "The characteristic Aesculus hippocastanum trees lining the \u201CGarden of\
  \ Great Explorers\u201D were complemented by the scent of blossoming orchids and\
  \ roses at the nearby Palace of Luxembourg, signifying that spring had arrived.\
  \ The distant Eiffel tower shimmering in the moonlit sky confirmed that I was in\
  \ the city of light.\n\nUpon disembarking at the metro station Saint Michel, the\
  \ art nouveau style archway served as my personal greeting into the acclaimed Saint-Germain-des-Pr\xE9\
  s area from the 19th century architect Henri Guimard himself. I could follow the\
  \ river Seine, or navigate my way through the narrow cobbled streets. The bright\
  \ yellow \"Gibert Jeune\" sign on my right piqued my attention towards the family-owned\
  \ bookstore which has taken the literature-loving Parisians by storm in its over\
  \ 130 years of existence. I approached the distinctly colourful and dragon-adorned\
  \ Saint-Michel Fountain, and while admiring the surrounding Hausmann style architecture,\
  \ I imagined that not much had changed in this area since the opening of the subway\
  \ system at the turn of the 20th century. \n\nAs I turned onto Rue des Grands Augustins,\
  \ the placards on the buildings lining the street brought history to life through\
  \ the former resident philosophers and intellectuals. I arrived at no. 13, and was\
  \ figuratively welcomed into the second location of one of France\u2019s oldest\
  \ teahouses by the founders Henri and Edouard Mariage. From the moment I stepped\
  \ inside, I could sense the celebration of the Camellia Sinensis plant in all its\
  \ glory. The scent of old-age spices evoking nostalgia of a time when tea was just\
  \ being introduced to the western world contrasted with that of the hint of delicate\
  \ jasmine flower petals. A collection of leaves from anywhere between the peaks\
  \ of the Himalayas to the world\u2019s most secret tea plantations deep in the mountains\
  \ of present-day Myanmar had undergone different levels of oxidation to fill the\
  \ hundreds of black tea canisters. \n\nThrough the French art of tea, I was faced\
  \ with a choice between a Darjeeling tea sourced from one of 87 specialized gardens\
  \ from the northern Indian region, a brilliant yellow tea shining as a golden Thai\
  \ pagoda, or a tea flavoured with exotic magnolia, honey of lychee, and white peach.\
  \ Who knew that a drink over 5000 years old could take me on a sensual journey in\
  \ a Russian caravan across the Gobi desert whilst I was in the middle of Paris wondering\
  \ if it would be blasphemous to try the bold coffee-like Mityani bop Ugandan tea."
