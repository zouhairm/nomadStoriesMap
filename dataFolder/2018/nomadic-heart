Text: A peacful morning is surely expected amidst the mountains. I was in the Dhauladhar
  range and had taken along a group of 9 people to trek towards kareri lake. As me
  headed from the base camp to camp 1 most of them wanted a break and that was the
  call. So while they were busy resting I saw a group of 3 men sitting and cooking
  lunch out of nowhere. It didn't seem like they lived there but however seemed to
  have taken a break for some rest. Their personality was that of a typical Pahadi
  Nomad as one would expect and were cooking some stew and a bread (typically something
  like bhakari). They offered me some to taste and though it wasn't full of spices
  it tasted delicious. They then told me how they are shepherds and love doing what
  they do. Their happiness towards what they do filled me with the wish of atleast
  trying to be a shepherd for a month (which is still a plan). They told me how the
  people there begin their day so early and sign off early as well. They were very
  welcoming people. I had to leave because we still had some more climb to reach our
  base camp but this little time with such great souls made me feel like a traveller.
  I felt one with the surrounding.
