Text: "Chadar is a winter trek in Zanskar,Ladakh,India;the last thing I expected was\
  \ this trip to be this amazing.\nI packed bare essentials paid Rs.20,000 to Adventure\
  \ & Thrills & booked flight to Leh.I reached Leh guest house on 3rd & met other\
  \ members of our group of 11 & guide Tenzing.\nOn 4th we were all brimming with\
  \ excitement as we got into the bus.The roller-coaster ride over steep hairpin bends\
  \ on snow covered road took us to Tilad Do (65km;10,390ft).In the middle we had\
  \ to pay Rs2,540 for permit.\nWe promptly wore our gum-boots for a trial walk.The\
  \ river was frozen & at places we could see the crystal clear water gushing.The\
  \ stretch was totally white with a bright contrast of near vertical cliffs upto\
  \ 600m which sprung on both sides of the river.\nThat night we camped there.Biggest\
  \ challenge for next day,& subsequent days,was to get out of the warm sleeping bags\
  \ & to go out into -20 -30\u2070C.\nOn 5th we started from Tilad Do to Shingra Koma(12\
  \ km,10,550 ft).As we walked over the thick ice,the real beauty of nature unfolded\
  \ itself before our eyes.The ice can do a Dr.Jekyll & Mr.Hyde at times.\nOn 6th\
  \ we walked through the deep ravines of the Zanskar.There were many caves & a couple\
  \ of waterfalls.One of them was frozen like a \u2018Shiva Linga\u2019.Surprisingly\
  \ the other waterfall was not frozen.We camped at Tibb Cave(10,760 ft,16 km).\n\
  On 7th our destination was Naerak camp(11,150 ft,14 km).We came across teams who\
  \ returned as the chadar was broken & it\u2019s difficult to climb hills,but I made\
  \ a decision that was going to push me to the edge.I told that we would camp there\
  \ & only who are willing would go to Naerak.Finally the guide agreed & 5 of us braved\
  \ our way to Naerak.\nIn the way I had to dodge breaking ice,see a porter falling\
  \ into river & rescued. There was around 100m of broken chadar & the hills had hardly\
  \ any way.The climb felt like Ethan Hunt in MI2,clinging on the mountain putting\
  \ feet on rocks hoping they would hold us.Finally we reached the mother-of-all frozen\
  \ waterfalls.I could see dozens of colors in that enormous ice structure as light\
  \ fell on it.The village was another hour of walk.We took refuge in one of the porter\u2019\
  s house.Making a local connection was the best thing that could have happened as\
  \ otherwise we would have had to sleep without our tents in the open.\nOver next\
  \ 2 days we returned to Tilad Do by walking through ankle deep water,climbing on\
  \ the cliffs at the side of the river as chadar has changed.Then it was our journey\
  \ back to guest house."
