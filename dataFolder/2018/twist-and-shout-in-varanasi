Text: "Traveling in India always presents some challenges to the western understanding,\
  \ but up until that day my experiences had gone quite smoothly, with just a few\
  \ habits to get used to, such as taking my shoes off before entering a temple or\
  \ paying a small amount of rupees to unwanted but really persistent local guides.\
  \ \n\nAfter a typical spicy breakfast, I started wondering in the small alleys of\
  \ the old town of Varanasi looking for the entrance to the Kashi Vishwanath temple;\
  \ I soon found out there were multiple, but only one opened to foreigners. Everywhere\
  \ around me pilgrims were lining up the typical indian way, which in no manner resembles\
  \ the shape of a line, buying milk and flowers to offer to the god. So when I found\
  \ the gate where they would let me in, I also took off my shoes and lined up holding\
  \ a string of yellow flowers. I started walking on a thick layer of humid dirt of\
  \ unknown composition, following the crowd and its collective movement towards the\
  \ entrance, although it was nowhere to be seen and probably still very far. \n\n\
  Surrounded by chants and bells ringing, we finally arrived at the gate and while\
  \ I was foretasting the sight of the beautiful golden temple, people suddenly started\
  \ to squeeze in until there was barely the space to move our chests and breath.\
  \ The crowd had swallowed me up, forcing me to move with its whirlpools. As I was\
  \ trying not to fall in the dirt, the crowd transported me in front of the altar\
  \ where the people were throwing their offers and I followed their movement, pitching\
  \ the yellow flowers towards the statue of Shiva, but there was no time left for\
  \ contemplation as the following wave of pilgrims was already pushing behind us.\
  \ \nWe then reached the site of a brahmin monk, \u201Cthink about the people you\
  \ love!\u201D he shouted me and incited me to sing a mantra with him for a few seconds.\
  \ The prayer was sealed with a handful of white mud rubbed onto my forehead and\
  \ as soon as this was done, the following crowd pushed us to the next step of the\
  \ visit, unexpectedly, the exit gate of the temple. \n\nI managed to get out of\
  \ the crowd on a sidewalk and found myself barefoot, covered up in dirt until my\
  \ knees, mud all over my face, still holding in one hand my for once useless guidebook.\
  \ I thought to myself \u201Cwhat about the golden dome?\u201D and bursted out laughing.\
  \ I sadly din't manage to admire the beauty of the famous temple but that day the\
  \ indian soul decided to absorb me into her crazy twirls and I fell in love dancing."
