Text: "I looked down from the window to ascertain the height as our truck precariously\
  \ swerved along the 13th winding ascent of the mountain. \u201CWow.\u201D I gasped.\
  \ The vehicles meandering through the roads below seemed like tiny ants making their\
  \ way uphill. These series of 21 winding roads form the famous Gata Loops on the\
  \ Manali Leh highway that take you to the top of the 3rd highest altitude pass-\
  \ Nakeela at 15,547 ft. The landscape was interspersed with every color imaginable\
  \ on a painter\u2019s palette. The bright sun accentuated the myriad hues of the\
  \ mountains \u2013 adding life and drama.\n\nAnother sweeping swerve\u2026my grip\
  \ tightened as my body swayed with full force towards the left at the 16th bend.\
  \ Yes\u2026I was counting! My pounding heart calmed when I felt the sting of the\
  \ chill air on the tiny beads of sweat on my forehead. \u201CYou okay?\u201D In\
  \ response I gave Vijay a thumbs up sign with a \u2018I might be shitting bricks\
  \ but hell yeah I\u2019m loving every bit of this\u2019 kind of smile. He chuckled.\
  \ \n\nBesides the surreal beauty I was also in awe of this man next to me on the\
  \ driver's seat. I remembered how that morning my group of bikers had left from\
  \ Sarchu to continue on our trip to Leh. Our journey was stalled midway - the bike\
  \ that I was riding pillion on had started giving issues. After what seemed like\
  \ an eternity, the sight of a fleet of trucks headed our way lifted our spirits.\
  \ An hour later I was perched up on the front seat of Vijay\u2019s truck \u2013\
  \ thrilled about my new ride. I would meet my friends at Tangla la. \n\nVijay owned\
  \ a transport business and had frequented this route for over 3 years now. He had\
  \ traversed some of the most treacherous terrains in India. This route - undoubtedly\
  \ - his favorite, he knew it at the back of his hands. This lanky man in his late\
  \ 30\u2019s had the swag of Snoop Dogg and the spirit of Dominic Toretto. He puffed\
  \ his \u2018bidi\u2019 nonchalantly as the tyres screeched when we made another\
  \ turn. Oftentimes he\u2019d wait for his other trucks to cross, constantly signaling\
  \ his drivers by tapping the side of his truck. He\u2019d hand over water and \u2018\
  bidis\u2019 to the laborers working along the roads. Invariably I\u2019d see other\
  \ vehicles giving way to our trucks, much like one would give way to a herd of elephants\
  \ in a jungle. These giant vehicles commanded respect and I was on one of them.\
  \ \n\nI checked my map \u2013Lachang la, Pang and then the 40 km stretch of More\
  \ Plains\u2026 another 4 hour tops...I need\u2026\n\n\u201CChai?\u201D Vijay asked,\
  \ as if he\u2019d read my mind. \u201CYes\u201D I beamed. \u2018Chai\u2019 sounded\
  \ perfect."
