Text: "He drifted me along and I was in a different world. Suddenly, I had the wings,\
  \ my arms spread wide, embracing the whole new freedom up in the air! As I came\
  \ out of my WOW, oh! Where are my friends? The wind which lifted me up, they were\
  \ still waiting for him to brace them. First flight of paragliding, experience still\
  \ sinking in me and there my friends landed their parachutes shouting we are late\
  \ for our bus! Infact, we had already missed the bus. Emotions at its peak \u2013\
  \ anxiety and joy, \u201COh God\u201D and \u201Csuperb\u201D- everything together;\
  \ an adrenaline rush! We were just 3 days old in this country rushing to catch the\
  \ bus which will let us board on the flight!  \nWe ran and ran hoping the gate not\
  \ closed and heard the flight is delayed by an hour.  Few extra breaths we grasped\
  \ and exhaled \u201CHuhhh\u201D! Completing the check-in formalities, we found a\
  \ cosy corner and finally allowed our emotions to surface again. Relishing the adventure,\
  \ we relived the moments in sky, with no traffic jams; neither of vehicles nor of\
  \ the thoughts!\nAnnouncements after announcements and it seemed as if the flight\
  \ is never going to take off today. The wind had changed its course and now he was\
  \ not ready to lift us up. A new adrenaline as we had a connecting flight to catch\
  \ and the layover was narrowing. The airport authorities came to inform us of no\
  \ clarity as to when the flight will take off. It was now very sure we will miss\
  \ it. He who gave us the extravagance of excursion, was now testing our patience\
  \ and much more. In this alien country, it was time to bring faith on a lady whom\
  \ we had never met before. Ruffled and baffled, it was time for some decisions and\
  \ let the instincts do its job. 12 hours and we were again back in the air; with\
  \ a joy and WOW, but this time we exhaled \u201CFinally\u201D!\nThe stranger had\
  \ arranged things so particularly. Every minute being important, we covered miles\
  \ smoothly, crossing continents. Yes, we travelled from Asia to Europe. Again, we\
  \ ran with the luggage before the gate closes to know the flight is delayed. It\
  \ wasn\u2019t any fiction novel, it was happening real! Earth completed its one\
  \ rotation and spin was in our mind!\nFinally, a new dawn, once more, we waited\
  \ for him to take us up. We let the sun glow on our face, relishing the colourful\
  \ sky and numerous hot air balloons around, in one such, adoring another beautiful\
  \ experience! \nAll it took was the 24 hours, 1440 thoughts and 86400 emotions for\
  \ the journey from one horizon to another!"
