Text: "All I wanted as my 18th birthday present was a trip to Rajasthan all by myself.\
  \ My parents agreed. \nWithin 40 hours, I was In the Pink City. City of Jaipur.\
  \ I had streams of excitement yet nervousness flowing through my body, because this\
  \ was my first outing alone. I booked my room and after a nap, I was off on my tour.\
  \ But what constantly kept grabbing my attention was the teen girl called \u2018\
  Fulwa\u2019 with my guide. I wondered if she was his daughter. She looked daunt,\
  \ quite dominated. Not for once did he give her a fatherly look. When the guide\
  \ stepped out of the cab to quench his thirst, the girl with some hope in her eyes\
  \ said that she wanted to run away with me. I knew there was something terrible\
  \ happening. Without even giving her request a second thought I took a rickshaw\
  \ which stopped only in front of my hotel.\nI comforted her in the room and made\
  \ her tell me what was wrong. As she proceeded with her story, I realized this 16yr\
  \ old was not a daughter but a wife to that 30yr old man. She had been sold. Sold\
  \ by her parents to kill their hunger and other greed\u2019s of life. I hugged her\
  \ to give her a homely feeling but then I realized that a homely feeling must have\
  \ been totally unfamiliar to her. I promised myself to help this girl out by admitting\
  \ her into a women\u2019s organization. My decision was not just because she was\
  \ a victim to injustice but also because she was brave and had big dreams which\
  \ she wanted to fulfill. When she talked of her dreams, her eyes spoke more than\
  \ her words. \u201CWhat do you want to be Fulwa?\u201D I questioned. \u201CA pilot\u201D\
  \ came a beaming reply. \u201CI want to fly, I want to see the world, I want to\
  \ be respected and\u201D \u201CAnd what?\u201D I encouraged her to talk. \u201C\
  And I want to show my parents that I am no material to be sold. That I am priceless\u201D\
  \ Tears started rolling down her eyes. Wiping her tears, I told Fulwa about admitting\
  \ her into the organization, and she was on cloud nine. Her eyes beamed with hope\
  \ again. She felt courageous.\nThat night before going to sleep, she asked me if\
  \ I regretted anything in life, \u201CI wish I was a little more beautiful.\u201D\
  \ I said smiling.\nThe next day when I dropped her at the organization, she looked\
  \ at me with teary eyes and whispered in my ears something which still resonates\
  \ in my ears, \u201Csomeone will always be more beautiful, someone will always be\
  \ more intelligent but someone will never be you.\u201D I exactly knew why she said\
  \ this.  I was really proud of Fulwa and myself. I felt proud. I felt beautiful\
  \ and I felt me."
