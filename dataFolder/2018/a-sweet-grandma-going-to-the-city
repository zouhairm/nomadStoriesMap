Text: "Her head had nestled back onto my shoulder, seemingly undisturbed by the jolting\
  \ of the bus as it rattles along the pothole-y road from Moalboal to Cebu. It is\
  \ freezing in the airconditioned bus, so I don\u2019t mind the invasion into my\
  \ personal space. Plus: the sweet old lady next to me reminds me of my own grandma.\
  \ Maybe it is her smell. Sweet and flowery, with a hint of rancid. Like the cream\
  \ she used was a bit past its prime. \n\nShe and her two girlfriends had boarded\
  \ the bus in some small little village in the middle of the thick forest. The bus\
  \ was full, and the only three adjacent seats were next to me. Giggling like schoolgirls,\
  \ the ladies took their seats and on we went. \n\nI glance over, trying not to disturb\
  \ her. Her wrinkly hands rest comfortably on her skirt. I also notice the patched\
  \ holes and the scuffed, but immaculately clean leather purse. Her clothes are old,\
  \ yes, but well taken care of. She is wearing her Sunday\u2019s best. \n\nA story\
  \ starts to form in my head: Grandma and her two besties are heading to Cebu. They\
  \ were jovial, so the occasion must be a good one. Maybe she is going to see her\
  \ children or she had saved up some money and decided to go shopping? A big adventure\
  \ in the big city. \n\nI am excited for them. But I am also a bit worried. Would\
  \ they feel overwhelmed by Cebu, coming from this tiny village in the countryside?\n\
  \nI also wonder what she thought of me. Backpackers like me were still a novelty\
  \ in the area. I am sure though that this was the closest she had ever been to a\
  \ foreigner, as her head bobbled back and forth on my shoulder. Could she even comprehend,\
  \ what backpacking meant? Traveling for months at a time must seem as foreign to\
  \ her as a trip to the moon. \n\nIn the meantime, the jungle gave way to the densely\
  \ populated outskirts of the city. My sweet grandma woke from her slumber. We ride\
  \ in silence for a while. Her girlfriends are still sleeping. Suddenly, she holds\
  \ a little breath mint under my nose. \u201CWhere are you from?\u201D She asks in\
  \ heavily accented, but easy to understand English. \n\u201CI, uhm, ah, I am from\
  \ Germany, but I live in the US.\u201D Flabbergasted, I stumble over my own words.\
  \ \u201CAre you and your friends going to Cebu?\u201D \n\u201CYes,\u201D she says,\
  \ \u201Cbut tomorrow we fly to Korea. We go see the Pope there. Have you been to\
  \ Korea?\u201D \nI almost choke on my breath mint. \u201CUhm, no, I have never been\
  \ to Korea. That sounds exciting!\u201D \n\u201CYes, we always go see the Pope.\
  \ Two years ago, we go to Jerusalem to see him. Have you been to Jerusalem?\u201D"
