Text: "This was our first international trip. For me and my wife were super excited\
  \ what was awaiting for us at the Thai peninsula.\n\nPhuket has an awesome night\
  \ life. I had my DSLR with me and had carried one bag full of lenses. Which better\
  \ place for a camera if not Thailand? Chimpanzees!!! Looking around, were beautiful\
  \ people from all over the world n all over the place. Im a people photographer.\
  \ So,  I started clicking pictures around of people, the old n the pretty alike\
  \ n a few of my wife. Now that I recollect this four years back, I feel bad of my\
  \ childish behavior. Nevertheless I'd be the same even now I guess given the camera,\
  \ Phuket n my wife. There were gorgeous chicks from Thailand n from all over the\
  \ world. Something my slr loves the most. But yeah,  only in the photography sense.\
  \ \nBy the time I reached the other end of the street, one gentleman who had probably\
  \ crossed me earlier, came up-to me n said I hope you are taking all these pics\
  \ not for a wrong motif. N I was like nodding my head as a big No. He then moved\
  \ on while I thanked him for his concern. It was late through the night while I\
  \ was still clicking pictures of the full moon this time. when we returned our hotel\
  \ room while my wife was all green, she refused to talk to me n I was like why are\
  \ you upset. What have I done? Little did I realize that I didn't give her a special\
  \ time for the special place. She hit the bed n I wound up saying whatever with\
  \ a heavy heart, took a beer n enjoyed the night cool breeze of the room balcony\
  \ overlooking the lit pool of the adjacent hotel. Wow I thought to myself. This\
  \ woman wouldn't change.\n\nWe went on field trips, did loads of snorkeling, did\
  \ scuba diving in which I almost drowned, sightseeing scenic locations, etc. N everywhere\
  \ there was beauty awaiting to be captured by the artistic me. But what a waste.\
  \ With my wife around in fact whose company I love the most, I couldn't keep her\
  \ happy along the whole trip. So,  I decided I would come again to Thailand without\
  \ my wife. Take my time to capture the beauty the place had to offer.\nOverall the\
  \ trip was good but not contended. having my wife upset about my photography passion,\
  \ I guess it left both of us unhappy most of the time. \nToday as I lay down wanting\
  \ to do a Thailand trip on my own, I get excited with the thought of it.  But the\
  \ next moment I'm thinking how can I do it without my wife around? After all what\
  \ excites me n motivates me is just she."
