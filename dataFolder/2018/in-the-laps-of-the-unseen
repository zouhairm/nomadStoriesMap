Text: "\u2018245, 246, 247\u2019. Panting like a hippopotamus after Thanksgiving dinner,\
  \ I hoisted myself up the last step of the tallest lighthouse in the world. The\
  \ lighthouse was constructed in 1865 on Island Amedee of New Caledonia. It had concrete\
  \ stars which adorned the top of the sparkling white structure. \n\nAs I leaned\
  \ pass a white star and gazed below, the most majestic symphony of colours greeted\
  \ my eyes. The sea was a vivid turquoise and had a transparency that revealed the\
  \ coral reef below like a jeweler's case. The reef was teeming with marine life,\
  \ layered upon a kaleidoscope of purple, red, and orange corals, fringed with acres\
  \ of snowy white sand and swaying palm trees. \n\nAs the sea glittered beneath the\
  \ balmy sunlight, a boat sailed quietly pass in the distance letting the breeze\
  \ carry it in blissful idle. The landscape was surreal and of outstanding beauty.\
  \ As I descended, I was sure to convey to the lighthouse keeper, my sincere desire\
  \ to live there for the rest of my life. \n\n\u2018Everything is imported here.\
  \ You can\u2019t fish because this area is a marine conservation zone, and you might\
  \ have to live on spam and instant noodles for the rest of your life\u2019, he said\
  \ empathetically in French. I contemplated that as I winded around the island looking\
  \ for an ideal snorkeling spot. \n\nLater that afternoon, I was invited to a traditional\
  \ feast in the mountainous interior of Bourail. The village was in the middle of\
  \ New Caledonia, fringed with the largest lagoon in the world and a symphony of\
  \ verdant green mountains. The local Kanyak tribes thrive here, harvesting tubers,\
  \ and feeding on the fish, deer, and wild game that inhabit its forests and sea.\
  \ \n\nThe long table was quickly filled with taro, fish, bananas and yam cooked\
  \ in banana leaves. The smell of barbecued wild venison and honey glazed beef intertwined\
  \ with the fragrance of tropical flowers wafted through our intimate gathering.\
  \ \n\nThe Kanyak culture places emphasis on family and tradition. The land is scared\
  \ and nature is something to be cherished. According to traditional culture, no\
  \ one person owns the land. Everyone shares it. \n\nAs I sat interwoven with happy\
  \ humming of French dialects and the scent of Hibiscus flowers, my tummy full of\
  \ the fruits of the land and sea, I received the biggest gift from New Caledonia.\
  \ To appreciate life is to be out in nature with loved ones, being content with\
  \ living life in a slow unhurried pace, and cherishing every single moment."
