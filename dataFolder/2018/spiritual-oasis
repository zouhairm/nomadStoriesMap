Text: "\"Come have some water, you must be tired as you have covered a distance of\
  \ 36 hours from Delhi to Kutch, that was how Daya Bhai as (everyone locally called\
  \ him) welcomed me on the chilly night of January in Bhujodi. \nNext day he woke\
  \ me up, asked me about my sleep & did I get freshen up from the hectic and tiring\
  \ train journey, my instant reply was (super energized). As usual, he asked me to\
  \ get fresh and ready for the breakfast. I got ready and went straight to the floors\
  \ of the aangan (verandah) near the kitchen where I was served a platter which was\
  \ consisted of thick pieces of bread (called rotlas in kutchi) along with poha (flaked\
  \ rice sauteed in a wok) with some local pickles and chutneys as accompaniment \
  \ I asked him why do you put so many things together on a plate & the reply was\
  \ that it makes the dish appear beautiful and colorful especially in a region of\
  \ dry and arid land. At that very moment, I realized how beautifully people adapt\
  \ themselves to the conditions and limitations of life. \nAfter having breakfast\
  \ he took me on a walk thru the entire complex of his school and showed different\
  \ areas of printing, dying and weaving, kept explaining to me that how long he has\
  \ been practicing the art of weaving and how does his son has refused to get into\
  \ the profession of weaving. My question to him was \"why\" and his simple reply\
  \ was that he wants to make his son an engineer and wants him to travel to city\
  \ and explore the world whereas I being from the city life exploring the real world\
  \ of simplicity, minimalism, and practicality and that's when I realized that how\
  \ the \"grass is always greener on the other side.\"\nWhile with him, he took me\
  \ to his home and the moment I entered, I saw a weaving loom in the side courtyard\
  \ and his elder son was weaving some fabric and he had even asked me to try my hands\
  \ on too. Secondly, he took me inside his house and I noticed the open kitchen and\
  \ how well and neatly all the utensils were places in gradation and I did ask him\
  \ why do you put them on display and his wife told me that it shows the wealth and\
  \ prosperity of their home. One interesting thing about any kutchi family was that\
  \ no matter how much hunger do you have or not, you were immediately welcomed with\
  \ three thalis (plates) full of fafda(chickpea flour savory), jalebi (sweet) and\
  \ green chilies to neutralize the sweetness of jalebi. That was how I spent the\
  \ entire day and lastly, i was parted along with the same words you must be tired\
  \ as you have walked a lot and take some rest."
