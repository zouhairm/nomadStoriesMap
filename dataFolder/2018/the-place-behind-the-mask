Text: "There is nothing more ludic to learn the history of a country than listening\
  \ to people who lived it. That\u2019s why connections with locals are the best way\
  \ to travel, it makes you understand the country and its people. \nI was travelling\
  \ with some friends by train across Europe, our last stop was Ljubljana, the Slovenian\
  \ capital, where we met the guy I want to talk to you about. \nWe went for a ballad,\
  \ and somehow, we arrived to Metelkova. It is a squat in a former Yugoslavian military\
  \ quarter, today painted with a lot of colors, strange and gloomy forms: some street\
  \ art by Slovenian artists. Later we discovered that it was the tendance place to\
  \ be. On the center of the place they were an adult-sized children game, we climbed\
  \ in it. After a few minutes Andra\u017E arrived. He seemed lost or drunk or stoned\
  \ but somehow nice and sweet. After some chit-chat, he began to confide.\nHe wanted\
  \ to recount his grandfather life to us, who died two years earlier, so we could\
  \ keep his memory too. During World War II, he had been requisitioned by the Germans\
  \ to work in concentration camp, at the crematorium. After these words, Andra\u017E\
  \ cried. It was really moving to have this grown-up guy, crying in our eight-teen\
  \ years old arms, ten minutes after we met.\nThere is no need to say more about\
  \ it, you know everything there is to know. \nThere is also no need to say that\
  \ it had been a real traumatism. \nHis only last wish was not to be incinerated.\
  \ And that\u2019s why Andra\u017E couldn\u2019t forgive himself; he did not succeed\
  \ to make this wish respected. \nBut he needed to speak, and I guess he had this\
  \ will to make foreigners understand the situation of his country. He described\
  \ us how he remembered the Red-Cross planes flying above his building when he was\
  \ approximatively our age, the fear he felt in these days. He told us, people missed\
  \ Yugoslavia, he explained how people used to talk about their brothers in Serbia\
  \ or in Macedonia, they felt more powerful and safe as a united country. They had\
  \ a leader, Tito, nowadays they don\u2019t have their word to say internationally.\
  \ Who knows the name of the capital of Slovenia ? The region is, according to him,\
  \ about to implose, there is way too much tensions, people are lost, their wound\
  \ did not healed yet. They lived a war not so long ago and it is not settled. \n\
  Behind the mask of tranquility that shows Ljubljana, the injuries are legion. That\u2019\
  s what shows Metelkova: the pain of a folk trying to distract himself while partying\
  \ in former military buildings."
