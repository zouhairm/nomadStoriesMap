Text: "I arrive in Jerusalem when it's already dark. Through a modern shopping mall,\
  \ I go straight into the old town \u2013 a clash between the new and the ancient,\
  \ between now and then. \n I go exploring \u2013 out of the quiet, desolated, sleeping\
  \ old town and into the lively, electric, new part of the city. The atmosphere is\
  \ light, filled with music and laughter. I look around wide eyed at the people spilling\
  \ out on the sidewalks, somewhat unsure about how I will be received \u2013 I'm\
  \ Polish, our nations have a complicated common history, filled with hurt, pain\
  \ and uneasiness.  \nSurprisingly, after learning where I'm from, the locals I\u2019\
  m talking to smile. I feel connected and accepted \u2013 what our ancestors went\
  \ through seems not to affect us. They tell me about how Jerusalem manifests a great\
  \ deal of variety, how it's beautiful in and out, and inspiring in all its differences.\
  \ \n The following morning, I decide to wander around the old city and find out\
  \ more about the fascinating, mixed cultures and traditions of the individuals comprising\
  \ a harmonious society within Jerusalem. \nWith a fresh pomegranate juice in my\
  \ hand, I stroll through the winding streets of the Old City and notice the atmosphere\
  \ is different compared to last night. There is an air of hostility underneath the\
  \ smiles, a hint of mistrust behind the looks. On the surface, everything seems\
  \ fine and in order. \n I direct myself towards the Muslim quarter and hear bells,\
  \ calling believers for their prayers. Shopkeepers close their stands in a hurry\
  \ to get to their sacred space in time. \n  And then, it hits me. \n My eyes start\
  \ to water and prickle with pain, I can't breathe, I start coughing uncontrollably.\
  \ Pepper spray. Why would anyone dowse pepper spray on the route to the mosque,\
  \ at the time reserved for prayer? Something incomprehensible has just happened\
  \ and I fail in efforts of trying to understand it. \n Later that day I set off\
  \ to find answers with the locals. Wherever I go, I hear a different view and version\
  \ of reality. The city that seemed congruous and tolerant turns out to be divided,\
  \ full of prejudice and resentment. I experience a dichotomy between the old and\
  \ the new, as if walls of the Old City guard the ancient order of religious divisions.\
  \ \n I ask myself can we as people in general, not only the inhabitants of Jerusalem,\
  \ learn to accept and be genuinely curious of others, of who they are and not who\
  \ they are supposed to be?"
