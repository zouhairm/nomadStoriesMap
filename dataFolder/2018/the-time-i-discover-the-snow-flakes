Text: "You can reach Buda Castle District from Clark \xC1d\xE1m t\xE9r by bus, the\
  \ Castle Hill Funicular (Sikl\xF3) or walk your way to the top of the hill through\
  \ one of the many stairways. I took the Hunyadi Stairs, named after Magyar military\
  \ leader J\xE1nos Hunyadi. The walk to the top of the hill really worth the effort,\
  \ as you get rewarded with one of the most beautiful views of Budapest. When I reached\
  \ the Danube Terrace, which holds an equestrian statue - Eugene of Savoy's monument,\
  \ erected in honor of the victorious leader of the Habsburg army in the Battle of\
  \ Zenta - The view from this terrace was mesmerising, even with the grey skies sucking\
  \ all the colours from the buildings, trees and the river, I must admit that it\
  \ didn\u2019t look like the Blue Danube at all, still it was beautiful.\n\nI felt\
  \ the cold getting worst and worst and it was when I remembered that the museums\
  \ where closed. The Royal Palace - Buda Castle itself, which is the home of the\
  \ National Gallery and the Budapest History Museum, are close on Mondays. However,\
  \ the streets, courts and courtyards of the Buda Castle District and even some of\
  \ its attractions are open day and night 24/7, like the Fisherman\u2019s Bastion\
  \ (Hal\xE1szb\xE1stya). \n\nI was in the Holy Trinity Square (Szenth\xE1roms\xE1\
  g t\xE9r) taking pictures of Matthias Church when suddenly I noticed some white\
  \ stuff in the air, to my surprise it started to snow, it was the first time I saw\
  \ a snowfall, I got a snow flake on top of my camera and I saw that it looks like\
  \ a snow crystal at naked eye, I always believed that you needed a microscope to\
  \ actually see the snow flake crystal form!. I know, you must be laughing, specially\
  \ if you live in Alaska, Iceland or some of the highest peaks in the world. I growth\
  \ up in Venezuela, a warm country bathed by the Caribbean Sea and blessed with sunny\
  \ days almost all year around, this was my fist snowfall. I will cherish this memory\
  \ of Budapest as it was the last thing I was expecting when trembling of cold.\n\
  \nIn couple of minutes the whole landscape started to change, the streets covered\
  \ in snow became all white, the 250,000 multicoloured roof tiles of Matthias Church,\
  \ slowly loosing its colours, as fresh snow knitted a white blanked over the roof.\
  \ It was like being in a fairy tale, then in the square next to the bastion, at\
  \ the bottom of the bronze statue of King St Stephen was a Medieval Falconer with\
  \ his hawk, this definitely completed the scene and make you feel like traveling\
  \ in time."
