Text: "Absolutely void, broken-hearted and disconnected from my true self after yet\
  \ another relationship had crumbled like a crispy buttery croissant, I was desperate\
  \ to get away from it all. There I was standing at the bus stop in the pouring London\
  \ rain, sobbing like an unattended toddler. All the busy commuters would walk past,\
  \ no one wondering if I was okay. People were getting crammed inside the bus shelter\
  \ not leaving much room for another person to squeeze in. I nestled on the porch\
  \ of the neighbouring building with the sign reading Bhuti - a spa salon named after\
  \ a Sanskrit word that means the feeling when you feel most like you; when the world\
  \ feels like a bike that you\u2019re riding, not a bus that you\u2019re chasing.\
  \ I thought this sign was the sign I needed to wave goodbye to the Albion and say\
  \ Namaste to Bombay. \n\nIn less than twenty-four hours I stepped out from the airport\
  \ and my personal chaos into the real chaos where coaches, cars and cows happily\
  \ co-existed on the road and where people were as numerous as mosquitoes in the\
  \ sky. With puffy from tears and saucer-sized from cultural shock eyes, I found\
  \ myself at another bus stop. One of the local, middle-aged ladies standing next\
  \ to me offered her help with directions. I did not know where I was going so I\
  \ nodded sideways. She scribbled her phone number on a piece of paper and handed\
  \ it over to me before boarding the bus. An hour had passed before I plucked up\
  \ my courage to hop on one too. At the last stop, there was seemingly nothing around.\
  \ I had no choice but wander in search of a shelter. I heard some music in the distance\
  \ and headed there like a mouse following the smell of a cheese. It turned out to\
  \ be a Holiday Inn where luckily, there was the last room left. I dropped dead on\
  \ the bed the second I saw it. I woke up to the loud Bollywood style music blaring\
  \ out of the window. I freshened up and called the lift downstairs. When it arrived,\
  \ my eyes got bigger than saucers \u2013 the lady from the bus stop was there in\
  \ front me, only now she was wearing a glamorous sari and looked like a movie star.\
  \ It turned out to be her niece\u2019s wedding where I got immediately invited to.\
  \ I danced the night away being made welcome by over a hundred strangers. Having\
  \ connected with one kind stranger, I felt connected to the whole community as well\
  \ as again to my true self. In the early morning, on my way up to my room, a male\
  \ backpacker walked in the lift and smiled at me. He was handsome and life seemed\
  \ bhuti-ful again."
