Text: "Short, sharp battle calls pierced the air. I saw his legs first, thin but strong,\
  \ whiter than I\u2019d expected. We stood in rows of four by the gate, women in\
  \ front, with our heads bowed. I remember looking down, staring at my bare feet,\
  \ but also stealing shy peeks through the wooden fence posts. The screams grew louder\
  \ as he approached; they came in bursts, like dog barks, only shorter and higher\
  \ pitched. \n As I became more daring with my peeks, I watched him fling his long,\
  \ grey ponytail madly in every direction. He had a runner\u2019s body, thin and\
  \ muscular, detailed with veins and wild, looping green-ink tattoos. He danced before\
  \ us, half-naked, wearing only a small rabbit fur garment around his waist that\
  \ pulsed with every twitch of his muscles. My palms grew sweaty. The warrior whipped\
  \ his tongue up and down and stuck it in and out again like a snake. He beat his\
  \ chest and twirled his spear before us. He stamped up and down on the ground and\
  \ pouted. \n Then, with a thud, his wooden spear landed at our feet, and the singing\
  \ began. The warrior opened the gate and led us up a spiral stone pathway to the\
  \ Marae. Out by the ocean, men practiced with taiahas, their fighting sticks. \n\
  \ The women of the Marae called to us from the porch. Their voices were deep and\
  \ manly but beautiful. We sang back to them, our heads bowed out of respect. At\
  \ last, we were invited to hongi, to exchange our breath and be officially welcomed.\
  \  \n The Maori arranged themselves in a receiving line and ordered themselves according\
  \ to their status within the tribe. The eldest male stood first, followed by his\
  \ wife. I pressed my nose and forehead to each member of their party one at a time,\
  \ exhaling into their skin, mingling my breath with theirs: a mutual assertion of\
  \ trust. Tena Koe, we said, and then shook hands. \n After the powhiri ended, we\
  \ were invited into the kitchen for pastries and afternoon tea. I met a young Maori\
  \ girl named Henney, who told me she could walk through walls and make rainbows\
  \ come out of her fingers. Henney and I played together in the wharenui, and her\
  \ cousins told me stories about the wooden ancestors on the walls. They pointed\
  \ out warriors with sharp tongues and huge penises and reenacted stories of love\
  \ triangles and whale-riding warriors. I could\u2019ve stayed forever. At the end\
  \ of our stay, the tribe elder explained to us that Maori never say goodbye. Saying\
  \ goodbye is reserved for those who are dying. And with that, we took in each other\u2019\
  s breaths and said see you later."
