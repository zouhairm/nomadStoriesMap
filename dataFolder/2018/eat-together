Text: "I dedicate this narrative to my beloved mother even if this work won't be noticed\
  \ among\nthousands of others. \nDespite being the only child of my parent, we were\
  \ always as absolute opposites as the Sun and the Moon often roughly confronting\
  \ each other. She hasn\u2019t got a fear of flying and I had. She loves everything\
  \ made in Russia and I don\u2019t.\nIf only not the trip that we made together last\
  \ summer, perhaps, we wouldn\u2019t still have broken the ice between us. Ten Georgian\
  \ holiday days spent together in Borjomi, a tiny place rich in thermal water with\
  \ the only main street hidden in the Caucasus mountains, were decorated with unexpected\
  \ events as well as fresh air, organic food, pine forests and Christian architectural\
  \ heritage that have resulted in an absolute renewal, mature friendship. \nHardly\
  \ had we began our journey when I lost my passport by distraction in the middle\
  \ of nowhere, between Borjomi and Kutaisi at a currency exchange store. It was soon\
  \ found thanks to a taxi driver called Georgiy, which is a name widely spread within\
  \ the country due to the deepest worship to Saint George. We all breathed out with\
  \ a great relief, not to mention that this man made a 6-hour ride to bring it back\
  \ to me. Viva, Georgia! \nLater on, all of a sudden I became ill \u2014 after a\
  \ boiling tour to Vardzia, an ancient cave city and monastery built by Tamar, Queen\
  \ of Georgia, night mountains cooled me off in a tricky way. Radiant and outwardly\
  \ imperturbable, my mother was carefully looking after me, not blaming me for the\
  \ spoiled holidays. \nMeanwhile, I felt incredibly ashamed and guilty for convincing\
  \ her to travel together precisely because as I thought I did not meet her expectations.\
  \ I\u2019m certain now that by reason of this, our experiences drew us closer together.\
  \ \u2018I would never leave you, honey. No matter what, no matter how different\
  \ we are\u2019, she said afterwards. \nTraveling together is a challenge to comprehend\
  \ whether people are synchronized, whether they will be staying together in the\
  \ end or not. \nBy the time my humble narrative has been finished, I will be marveling\
  \ a picturesquely flamboyant sunset at Playa Tamarindo in Costa Rica submerging\
  \ into a dimension of the reality called here \u2018pura vida\u2019 (simple life),\
  \ sharing a common \u2018shelter\u2019 with my roommate Vanessa from Germany \u2014\
  \ we both came here to study Spanish \u2014 whose sudden appearance into my life\
  \ would be transmitted, I prefer to believe, into a thriving friendship called simply...Pura\
  \ vida."
