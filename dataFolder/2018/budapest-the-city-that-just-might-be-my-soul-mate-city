Text: "I recently visited Budapest for the first time while I was spending a few weeks\
  \ in Zagreb, Croatia I planned to be there for 3 days since it was an easy 5-hour\
  \ getaway by bus but just as easy to get there by train, plane or river cruise.\n\
  I learned thru my research on the city that Budapest has 3 sides, Buda, Obuda and\
  \ Pest, divided by the Danube River, consider this when planning to book hotels\
  \ and things to do in the City. I decided to book hotels in both the Buda side and\
  \ the Pest side, not because they were far away or difficult to get too from each\
  \ other, but because I wanted to experience the \"vibe\" of both sides.\nThe last\
  \ thing I expected was to find myself so mesmerized by the Buda side of Budapest.\
  \ As I walk thru the cobblestone streets of this side of town, I became overwhelmed\
  \ with emotion, I felt inexplicably happy. I cannot explain why, If I believe in\
  \ reincarnation (which I am not saying I do or I don\u2019t) I could probably explain\
  \ it by saying maybe I lived and was very happy in the Buda side of Budapest, once\
  \ upon a time.\nRegardless, I cannot emphasize enough, how spectacular the Buda\
  \ side of Budapest is, it has not only a lot of history, it has some of the most\
  \ exquisite architecture, cobble stone streets and ambience that I have ever experienced\
  \ in any city or country I have ever visited. Of course, your experience will be\
  \ different than mine, but I sure hope you get to visit this fine city and discover\
  \ why Budapest is indeed a magical, singular and spectacular city that can easily\
  \ be discovered on foot, subway, tram or bus.\nThe Pest side of Budapest is also\
  \ enchanting and oh so different, different vibe, different scene, different architecture,\
  \ and so worth a visit, get there when you can, you will be happy you did. Visit\
  \ the parliament, cross by foot one of the many bridges that connect the city, like\
  \ the chain bridge, visit the many sites, including Heroes square, Doh\xE1ny Street\
  \ Synagogue, one of the many thermal baths, have some old-world comfort food, visit\
  \ the Central Market, one of the ruin bars (old run down buildings , transformed\
  \ in hip and fun bars), or the Saint Stephen Basilica.\nI came to Budapest with\
  \ no expectations, but knowing that like many European cities, it would be full\
  \ of history and architecturally rich, however, I found it to be much more, it was\
  \ a feast for the senses and surprises at every turn. I left Budapest with a sense\
  \ of excitement, wonder and feeling of d\xE9j\xE0 vu that I am certain I will visit\
  \ again, no doubt."
