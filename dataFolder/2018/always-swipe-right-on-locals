Text: "Cool air pierced through my jacket as we waited for a cab, suitcases in tow.\
  \ Surveying the raindrops pelting the mountain of bicycles chained outside of Centraal\
  \ Station, I made up my mind: no way would I ride a bike in this weather. \n\nFast\
  \ forward six hours, and I\u2019m clutching Pam\u2019s waist as she pedals us with\
  \ expert agility through narrow streets lined with stepped-gable buildings. I packed\
  \ myself up like a local\u2019s grocery bag and perched on the bike\u2019s rear\
  \ rack, my legs burning as my muscles worked overtime to keep my feet from dragging\
  \ on the cobblestone. The combination of wind and giddiness pulled the corners of\
  \ my mouth into a frozen grin as my eyes absorbed the charm of Amsterdam\u2019s\
  \ canals. \n\nAs the city\u2019s splendor unfurled with each wheel rotation, my\
  \ thoughts churned back to the reason I was there: because of a swipe back home\
  \ in San Francisco.\n\nWhen I first moved to San Francisco, I shamelessly downloaded\
  \ the dating app Tinder. Clicking through men, Sam caught my interest: a British\
  \ designer with a just-back-from-vacation tan. Swipe right.\n\nThis swipe morphed\
  \ into a long distance relationship. In lieu of regular date nights, we occasionally\
  \ circumvent the world to meet in far-flung locales. On one such \u201Cdate\u201D\
  \ in Chiang Mai, Thailand, we made red curry, pad thai and a friendship with a Dutch\
  \ couple named Pam and Nick.\n\nThe four of us spent the next few days feeding off\
  \ the frenetic energy of the Chiang Mai Night Bazaar, with its massive sprawl of\
  \ relentless vendors. We crammed into tuk tuks together as our drivers darted between\
  \ cars, seemingly ignoring traffic laws. We bonded over Chang beers in the Old City,\
  \ and danced together as crowds spilled into the craggy streets. Most importantly,\
  \ we stayed in touch. \n\nNine months later and 5,400 miles away from where we first\
  \ met Pam and Nick, our friends approached on their bikes and urged us to hop on\
  \ board. The rain had finally stopped, but the bone chilling air remained. \n\n\
  Regardless of weather, Amsterdam\u2019s vast cycling network paves the way for a\
  \ unique lifestyle - one built upon goals of saving energy and reducing car deaths,\
  \ which activists fought for after an influx of automobiles killed 400 Dutch children\
  \ in 1971. Today, over 60 percent of trips within the city are made via bike. \n\
  \nFailing to embrace this lifestyle would have been blasphemy. If Sam and I could\
  \ trust dating app algorithms in San Francisco and tuk tuk drivers in Chiang Mai,\
  \ we sure as hell could trust friends in Amsterdam."
