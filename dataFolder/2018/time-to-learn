Text: "TIME TO LEARN.\n\nI was always curious about the outside world, I felt like\
  \ there were something bigger, exciting and unexplored happening. little by little\
  \ this curiosity started to make noise to be explore, and after always be in the\
  \ same routine and comfort zone, only 2 question were enough to explore this curiosity;\n\
  \n-\u201CIs this how the rest of my life will be\u201D? spending life to make money,\
  \ always in the same routine, just adding more responsibilities as im growing \u2026\
  \n\n-\u201DIs this really me? or is just the version of me where I grew up?\u201D\
  \ I want to know who I truly \_am, not what \_I HAVE BEEN \_TOLD TO BE.\n\nHow can\
  \ I be sure who I truly am if I haven't been outside of \_my country and comfort\
  \ zone?, if I haven't really push myself into my own discovering adventure... I\
  \ believe I'm 2 different me; one my \_body (my ego), one spirit (my soul).\n\n\n\
  After one year of difficult decisions, and painful steps, \_I reached the magical\
  \ moment, when my soul screamed louder than my body, to give me the \_strength I\
  \ needed \_to \_make that big change in life and jump into a new adventure (a messy\
  \ rollercoaster) to take the time to learn to become my soul, leaving any TAG I\
  \ was behind.\n\u201Close to mix, learn to become\u201D.\n\nIt wasn't easy to leave\
  \ home, comfortability, and a successful career. My \_family, friends and boyfriend,\
  \ tried to stop me from it, but I \_fight harder than all this, to find a way to\
  \ open a new path in my journey, and for the first, do something better with my\
  \ life \_than follow rules and make money, take the time to \_AWAKE!, awake that\
  \ \_big part of me that for many years was asleep.... \_\_\n\nAll set up, mind and\
  \ body ready to travel the world.\n\nI will immerse into a 1 year traveling adventure,\
  \ with all my fears and questions packed in a small backpack around Asia and Africa,\
  \ free and full of possibilities, volunteering \_in different programs, from teaching\
  \ English in small farms around Asia, helping in Buddhist temples in Thailand, Empowering\
  \ women in India, and building schools \_in Kenya. Sharing what I have, taking what\
  \ I'm missing, leaving \_my believes back home to \_become \_theirs, mixing and\
  \ creating a real connection with the locals, to get a deep \_understanding of their\
  \ ways to live life, and see how awaken and connected are with their souls in their\
  \ bodies. \n\n-Once again as a kid, i will be a whiteboard ,ready to learn, play\
  \ and transform with the world, to \_become a new me , this \_time one i will chose\
  \ to become."
