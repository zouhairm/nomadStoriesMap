Text: "It was a calm house party on a Saturday night, when my impulses rose high.\
  \ I knew I was upto something crazy. It was 2 am in the morning, I declared to my\
  \ friends that we are going trekking. \n\n\u2018Locked\u2019 with impulse and \u2018\
  loaded\u2019 with stupidity, we kick started our motor cycles. As we moved along\
  \ I felt like cold wind is colder than it used to be just like our trip. I ignored\
  \ the whisper and enjoyed the breeze. Last few miles we entered a small village\
  \ road surrounded by trees. It got narrower as we moved close to the destination.\
  \ Finally the lady from google Map shouted to stop. \n\nWe saw a village man who\
  \ asked us to take him with us as a guide bargaining for a hefty amount of money.\
  \ \u2018No\u2019, our voices resonated, with drunk and young blood running through\
  \ all of us. The guide warned us to be careful of wrong turns and animals. And what\
  \ are the odds, we ended up halfway in a monolithic giant stone from where we can\u2019\
  t climb up nor we can come down. We held some side grasses to avoid our feet slipping\
  \ down with mist on the stone. Exhausting all our light sources now we can barely\
  \ see what\u2019s beneath. Amidst some nervous noises from my friends, I looked\
  \ up the stone and it felt to me like a tip of a mountain and from where everything\
  \ ends. \nI closed my eyes to gain some strength. With some composure and hope three\
  \ of us looked into each other. We were lying down on set stone and climbed holding\
  \ each other. After hard and dark 35 minutes we solved it. \n\nEveryone was speechless\
  \ for some time. We lied down looking up, as the shooting stars in silence was our\
  \ fireworks of dark celebration and the learning was our prize for a lifetime."
