Text: "I lived in Whistler on a working holiday visa for 1 year and 3 months. Many\
  \ said that it isn\u2019t work, you\u2019re just on an extended holiday. Some days\
  \ that was true, other days it was the complete opposite. The last thing I expected\
  \ was being able to completely change my mindset and lifestyle from spending on\
  \ whatever I wanted & comfortable in knowing I have money in the bank to really\
  \ only spending on things & activities I value and being comfortable with living\
  \ paycheck to paycheck. What I got in return was a way of living that I have applied\
  \ to my everyday life and to any holiday I take, and I feel so much more satisfied\
  \ because of it. \nIn winter, you wake up, check the snow levels and decide just\
  \ how early you go up the mountain. We had the 20 cm rule. If less than 20cm of\
  \ fresh snow fell, it\u2019s a good day for a sleep in or to relax until the crowds\
  \ have thinned and you won\u2019t have to dodge jerry\u2019s left right and centre.\
  \ More than 20cm, it\u2019s up earlier than the crack of dawn to wait in line in\
  \ the freezing cold to get that elusive fresh line through the POW. \nIn summer,\
  \ the sun is up from 5am to past 9pm. One day I went snowboarding at the glacier,\
  \ did a bit of trail riding and then went for a hike. All in one day.\nWhat a life\
  \ hey?\nOf course there\u2019s the other side to it. Whistler is not known for being\
  \ affordable with many falling trap to the party lifestyle offered on the peasant\
  \ wages. It was a huge shock coming from Australia where 3 days of my wages was\
  \ equivalent to almost 2 weeks of wages in Canada. How was I supposed to survive?\
  \ The cost of living is the same but the wages are a third of what I\u2019m used\
  \ to. \nIt took a month before it sunk in that I wasn\u2019t making enough to fund\
  \ my usual lifestyle. I\u2019d used half of my savings and had to change how I thought\
  \ quick smart. So I did. Nothing magical, it took time and a constantly reminding\
  \ myself to spend money where I truly valued it. In the end, I didn\u2019t end up\
  \ sacrificing on the experience I had because I understood what I wanted from my\
  \ time in Whistler. I made the most of my time there and signed myself up for all\
  \ the experiences I knew I wouldn\u2019t regret doing. I never expected that a flippant\
  \ decision to go to Whistler for 6 months would produce such a valuable and lasting\
  \ life experience.\nComing back, I\u2019ve applied this new mindset to everything\
  \ in life. From wedding planning, work and of course, holidays.  Life hasn\u2019\
  t been cheaper, but I\u2019ve gotten the best value out of it. Not a bad way to\
  \ live right?"
