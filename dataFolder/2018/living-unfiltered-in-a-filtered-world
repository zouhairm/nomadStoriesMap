Text: "In a world where filters and angles seem to rule every photo we see, my goal\
  \ was to disconnect, grow, and explore- and to see it all in person- unfiltered\
  \ and all.\n\nIt is the moments no one really wants to talk about. When you get\
  \ to a place that you have dreaming of your entire life, only to see it basically\
  \ destroyed and trodden with tourist footsteps. Jammed so packed you can\u2019t\
  \ even squeeze yourself in for a selfie. Years of history destroyed for modern moments.\
  \ To the point you quietly ask yourself will this even be here in 100 years? And\
  \ only for a fleeting second on a feed somewhere thousands of miles away. Moments\
  \ like this make you think, humble you, make you want to be more mindful and conscious\
  \ of the earth. These moments make you crave the path less traveled. The unfiltered.\n\
  \nThe path \u2018less traveled\u2019 is often discovered while exploring, or in\
  \ less fanciful terms, when you\u2019re utterly lost. The times that catch you off\
  \ guard, scare you. Getting lost in the winding roads in a foreign country and finding\
  \ yourself at a dead end which just happens to be a secluded gem in the flurry of\
  \ famous. Being the only one there and reaffirming that true, untouched places still\
  \ exist in their unfiltered beauty. So rare you almost don\u2019t even want to share\
  \ it. An epiphany. Now every moment isn\u2019t sweet tears of epiphany. Sprinkled\
  \ in are the long nights sleeping under the ever-present fluorescent lights in the\
  \ airport and waking up next day with eyes bloodshot so red that you would never\
  \ imagine posting without that Valencia filter. But after finding your next destination,\
  \ the beauty of present somehow completely dissipates any crick in your neck or\
  \ burn in your eyes from previous nights. It\u2019s finding that glimmer of wifi\
  \ not so you can boast but so you can share with those closest to you in the private\
  \ album that doesn\u2019t see the light of any social media. The album doesn\u2019\
  t show only the perfect, flawless photos, but the outtakes and bloopers of each\
  \ day as well. To keep these is a reminder that life is an unfiltered journey that\
  \ you are discovering firsthand. \n\nI am not the social media \u2018queen\u2019\
  \ that most of the masses aspire to be- I have dark circles from long nights at\
  \ the airport, wrinkles from hours of delirious laughter, both disappointing and\
  \ beautiful stories to tell, and a little chubbiness from the many home-cooked meals\
  \ that have filled my belly. But with this I have a lifetime stories to tell, and\
  \ hopefully many more to come. This is my unfiltered world."
