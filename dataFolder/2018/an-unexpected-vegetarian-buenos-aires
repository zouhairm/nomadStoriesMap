Text: "I have been fascinated by Argentina for the majority of my life. I somehow\
  \ convinced my parents to take me to see \u201CEvita\u201D in movie theaters when\
  \ I was in kindergarten. I returned to school, surprising my teachers with my in\
  \ depth knowledge of Peronism and my obsession with the Evita soundtrack. Ever since\
  \ then, Argentina has been a country that fascinated me and a place I wanted to\
  \ visit. My trip to Argentina was inevitable. \n\nAs I arrived in Buenos Aires,\
  \ I was blown away by visiting the sites I had read about for the last twenty years,\
  \ but expected that my vegetarianism would serve as a barrier to truly understanding\
  \ Argentina. As an avid traveller and a life long vegetarian, I had gotten used\
  \ to missing out on food experiences and sometimes feeing left out of local culture.\
  \ As much as I commit to seeking out an authoring and local experience, food sometimes\
  \ poses a barrier in cultural sharing. Vegetarian options always exist but I find\
  \ these options are sometimes relegated to western comforts like pizza for example\
  \ rather than experiencing vegetarian versions of authentic native foods. \n\nI\
  \ was flummoxed by the prevalence of vegetarian food in Argentina. It did not feel\
  \ like I was missing out on the infamous Argentina beef. Without even trying, we\
  \ always happened upon the most unexpected vegetarian only restaurants. Flaky pastries\
  \ with rich fruity fillings filled coffee shops. Vegetarian restaurants proudly\
  \ advertised their original concessions made of local produce. Corn empanadas were\
  \ a staple snack food as I traversed the trails surrounding the astounding Iguazu\
  \ Falls. Tarts with fresh vegetables and freshly squeezed juices enticed my taste\
  \ buds constantly. \n\nOn my last day in Buenos Aires, I was desperate to find an\
  \ affordable way to experience Tango. After consulting some locals and a little\
  \ internet research, I happened upon the tango milonga at \u201CLa Catedral Club.\u201D\
  \ Not knowing what to expect, we trekked on a bus, the subway, and checked out the\
  \ metro until we arrived at the unassuming entrance. As we walked in, I felt translated\
  \ into a magical land. The dim lights highlighted unique and odd lighting pieces.\
  \ It became apparent that we were not only in store for an authentic tango treat,\
  \ but that the menu was fully plant based! It was a fitting vegan tango end to my\
  \ unexpected easy vegetarian trek through Argentina."
