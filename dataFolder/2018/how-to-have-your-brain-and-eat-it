Text: "Gunshot pierced the air as Pete loomed up in front of us, as if out of nowhere.\
  \ Leering wildly he hoisted his trophy up high, its arms splayed out, body sagging.\
  \ Traces of blood.\n\nAndy\u2019s face was incredulous, \u201CPete? That doesn\u2019\
  t bother you?\u201D\n\n\u201CVamos, vamos,\u201D Jorge urged us to hurry - flies\
  \ were swarming at the thought of a hot meal. As I tried to keep up I could see\
  \ a blue backpack ahead, bobbing up and down on Jorge\u2019s shoulders, carcass\
  \ draped across the top, tangled arms and legs dangling.\n\nJorge and Pete began\
  \ hacking with machetes, Pete providing wood, Jorge fashioning it expertly into\
  \ a parrilla. Pete enthusiastically chopping, Jorge building and lighting a fire.\
  \ The jungle had started to suffocate us, our skin crawled from the humidity, we\
  \ hadn\u2019t washed in days, we were blistered and bleeding, petty quarrels starting\
  \ to fester. We settled on the ground with mugs of hot tea, mosquito coils smoldering.\
  \ The show was about to begin.\n\nJorge was small strong and wiry, muscles honed\
  \ by years of hard living, skin beaten by the sun. Deep grooves etched his swarthy\
  \ face. He was a man you immediately trusted and felt safe with. We had bonded with\
  \ him instantly when we had met. A man of few words and none of them English.\n\n\
  He positioned the monkey on top of the grill. He held it tightly with one hand while\
  \ he seared its body with a flame held in the other. The fur turned a darker brown\
  \ and an acrid smell filled the air. With a sharp knife he scraped away every tuft\
  \ of singed hair from skin. Its weight was taking its toll and Jorge\u2019s face\
  \ was wringing with sweat. All I could see now was a white body resembling a small\
  \ child. Jorge kept his back to me as he dismembered it with precision and cut up\
  \ the torso. The flesh and bones were laid out flat and covered with salt. They\
  \ were parceled up neatly in layers of thick banana plant leaves and would cook\
  \ slowly through the night as the embers were stoked.\n\nA battered pot full of\
  \ water dangled above the flames. As the water gradually heated up the vital organs\
  \ were dropped in. Brain. Heart. Liver. As they began to cook, Pete and Andy bickered\
  \ over which of them would feast on the brain. Jorge stood up quietly and walked\
  \ carefully over to the river, there was blood and guts in the water and fish had\
  \ come to feed. With flashlight in one hand and machete in the other he swiftly\
  \ sliced off the head of a fish and tossed its body on the grill. His glance over\
  \ at me said a thousand words - he knew I had no stomach for monkey."
