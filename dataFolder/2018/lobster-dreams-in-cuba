Text: "A wicked romp on the wild side that will win you over. My first impression\
  \ was that I had been thrown into a Quintin Tarantino movie confusion was my only\
  \ guide. Don`t expect free wi-fi, nice hostels and easy routs, don`t expect anything\
  \ not even to have 1 currency because you will be fooled. Things work in a different\
  \ way here they have their own swag you won`t be able to compare it to anything\
  \ or anywhere. Your phones will just be a mere piece of plastic, your only google\
  \ app will be your tongue and a map your best friend. Taxies will be expensive and\
  \ so will most of all the things you will want to taste, ride or sleep in. You will\
  \ feel like you`ve been put in a time machine and as soon as your out of the airport\
  \ you will be drifting through palm tree streets, chevys from the 50s, ideals of\
  \ revolution written everywhere like a mantra and Che Guevara portraits with \u201C\
  Cuba Libre! and Hasta la Victoria Siempre!\u201D here and there like the spots on\
  \ a jaguar. Havana is eclectic, loud and run down, busting with people beeping from\
  \ every direction, music pumping from every corner and shops with mostly empty shelves\
  \ reminding you how Cuba is a ration nation. Pack a lot of patients bus rides will\
  \ be tortoise and sometimes take much longer than expected, bathrooms will be your\
  \ worst nightmare, gastroenteritis will stab you in the back and somebody will ask\
  \ you to exchange your watch for their guitar. But you will also find a family that\
  \ will buy a cake for your birthday and set up an amazing surprise party where you\
  \ will dance salsa and drink cuba libres, eat the best lobster of your life, meet\
  \ some of the most colorful people in the world that will never decline an invite\
  \ to sit at your table chat and sing, dance and smoke a homemade cigar. Goodbyes\
  \ will be hard and long hugs will finish every single one of them, people will share\
  \ their best smiles and stories even if times are difficult, you will never feel\
  \ alone and you will definitely leave a piece of your heart here. All your beliefs\
  \ on Cuba will crumble and you will love and hate it all together. Where thousands\
  \ of people, colors and dances blend into making a mosaic called Cuba you will stop\
  \ believing In Murphy`s law and enjoy it`s raw and distinct history and lifestyle."
