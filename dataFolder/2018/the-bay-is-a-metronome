Text: "We began walking down the crest of the beach, feet occasionally rinsed by the\
  \ waves and sandals dangling from our fingers. The bay culminated in a hazed tropical\
  \ cape that called for exploration. We left behind the fishermen\u2019s boats, stranded\
  \ because the tide was still low in the early hours of the morning. A band of big,\
  \ dark feathered scavengers that locals call \u2018gallinazos\u2019 feasted on some\
  \ spoils. The neighboring abandoned mines painted the sands with a shiny black dye.\
  \ The bright, greyish sky was always flirting with light rain, but never quite delivered.\
  \ The air was wet and still not too hot, perfect for a stroll. It was when we turned\
  \ the corner next to the rescued animal shelter that we heard the faint tunes of\
  \ a recorder coming from the jungle.\n\nMompiche is a two-street village by the\
  \ Ecuadorian coast, jammed between the Pacific and the Mache-Chindul Ecological\
  \ Reserve. A place caught half-baked in its process of modernization, the town is\
  \ a low-key peregrination site for surfers around the world. The mix of the laid-back\
  \ surfing culture and the uncanny landscapes of the place produces a very special\
  \ kind of vibe. That\u2019s why I first thought the music belonged to a practice\
  \ routine from one of the old-school hippies that find retreat in the town. I was\
  \ wrong though. When we reached the end of the cove, we saw a young, hair-gelled\
  \ guy in a basketball t-shirt leaning against a motorbike used to deliver fast food\
  \ from a restaurant nearby. His eyes were closed in complete concentration. We moved\
  \ past him and climbed the roots of a tree to enter the trail into the cape.\n\n\
  The track was muddy and vetted with green vines and bright flowers. We kept going\
  \ until it ran dead in a clearing. We then decided to climb through the bushes to\
  \ finally circle one big lonely tree. There, already on top of the hill, the shock.\
  \ A disperse field of white crosses planted on a slope that led to the cliff, all\
  \ facing the bay. The shoreline stretched beyond our topographical knowledge. The\
  \ ground was so soft that many of the crosses were sinking; wolfed by the earth,\
  \ back to the soil, back to the sea. We stood motionless. Looking down the end of\
  \ the graveyard, a boy was sitting at the edge of the precipice, sipping a cup of\
  \ coffee, eerily sad. \n\nWe traced our steps back to the beach. Time had passed\
  \ faster than we were aware. The tide had dangerously gone up, covering the spot\
  \ where the delivery guy used to play the recorder. He was gone, and the sea was\
  \ instead."
