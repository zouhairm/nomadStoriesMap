Text: "Reykjavik November 2013\n\nIn the Spring, we decided to go there in the fall.\
  \ When we arrived it was the final month before winter, and already the ground was\
  \ covered deep with snow and the daylight hours were upon us for only 6 hours and\
  \ there was that bleak stillness throughout the town. We thought we should hire\
  \ a car and to make our way from the West of the Island after some nights spent\
  \ in Reykjavik toward the East until we touched the easternmost point. We hugged\
  \ the southern highway from the West to the East.\n\nIt was the landscape that I\
  \ noticed first, dense moss-like covered ground that sponged underfoot and low mountains\
  \ running into flat. The highways long and straight and great trucks flying through\
  \ the night taking up the space that was meant for two small cars. We drove and\
  \ drove, for most of the trip we drove because we were shy of the weather and so\
  \ our driving was a slow thing. What you notice second in Iceland is the beautiful\
  \ hot springs dotted everywhere over the land. And so we drove from one hot source\
  \ to the next, meeting very few others but ourselves along the road. \n\nWe talked\
  \ of Physics while we sat and while we moved, because the two friends that I had\
  \ traveled there with were both young physicists. They taught me the theory that\
  \ if you throw a tennis ball at the wall enough times, once-just once- the ball\
  \ may pass through the wall. It was more complex, but it is the image of a ball\
  \ passing through the wall that has stuck with me over these past few years.\n\n\
  As we reached the East we found the blacksand beach with the ice cubes as large\
  \ and translucent us the three of us standing. I wore a bright blue dress and a\
  \ bright blue parker, I think I liked the strikingness of it against the winter.\
  \ And when one travels with men one longs to feel colour against the skin sometimes.\
  \ We made it to the east, but that is too precious a story to tell here, and so\
  \ I will only say that the third thing you notice in Iceland are the Reindeer, how\
  \ beautiful they are spread out across the snow as if you didn\u2019t exist to them\
  \ at all. And the last thing that you notice, are the people. Beautiful inward people\
  \ who speak in myth and keep themselves warm together in great pools that span their\
  \ rooftops and their neighbourhoods. Shy people who want only what is best for you\
  \ because you are living in their winter too. If I could go back to that time and\
  \ sit beside my young self, I would say to her- what are you so afraid of? They\
  \ love you both."
