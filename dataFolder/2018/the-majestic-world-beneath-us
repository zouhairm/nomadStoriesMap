Text: "It was something that I have always wanted to do, I shouldn\u2019t be feeling\
  \ nervous, but maybe everybody feels this way the first time they dive in the ocean.\
  \ Standing on the beach, waiting for the boat to be ready, I felt that thrill of\
  \ trying something new for the first time. We were given instructions to help push\
  \ the boat over the shore and then jump in. It\u2019s certainly isn\u2019t as easy\
  \ as it looks but we managed to get in the boat and soon we were well on our way\
  \ to the dive reef. \nMozambique is probably one of the best place to go diving\
  \ in Southern Africa. The beautiful beach landscapes and swelling blue seas make\
  \ you feel like you\u2019re in another world, especially when you come from the\
  \ grey jungle of city life. As a thalassophile, I love everything associated with\
  \ the ocean and I don\u2019t get nearly enough time by the sea. Scuba-diving is\
  \ something I had always wanted to do and now the opportunity finally came and I\
  \ was ready for it.\nThe swells were high that particular day, so we opted for a\
  \ shallower reef. We geared up and we did our back rolls into the sea. From that\
  \ first dip in, I felt at home- comfortable with a sense of belonging. Inflators\
  \ up, air released and we descended towards the bottom of the reef. At first all\
  \ I saw was blue water all around me, and then after 12m, I was exposed to an incredible\
  \ world, just bursting with life! From that very moment, I knew I would have a lasting\
  \ connection with this place! Fish swimming around we, corals spread out beneath\
  \ me, I felt a sense of peace. On that first dive, I felt completely comfortable\
  \ in the ocean, watching parrot fish feeding, moray eels popping out of their hidings\
  \ and brightly coloured fish that make the eyes light up with joy. What felt like\
  \ 10 minutes turned out to be an hour and soon we had to head back up. This time\
  \ we filled our BCD\u2019s with air and ascended slowly, stopped for our decompression\
  \ stop at 3m and then we were looking at blue skies above us. We jumped back into\
  \ the boat and the whole ride back, I was in complete awe of what I had just experienced.\
  \ I looked around at the blue ocean around me and I was lost in thought about the\
  \ majestic world below us that we only know a glimpse of."
