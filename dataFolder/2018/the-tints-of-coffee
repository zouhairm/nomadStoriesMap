Text: "I woke up at dawn to the sound of birds singing, opening my eyes and slowly\
  \ realizing where I was\u2026beautiful. It was a clear day and the sun was about\
  \ to turn the jungle into an open Hammam. I put water on to boil and smelled the\
  \ ground beans, happy to start the day with my favorite addiction, coffee. The first\
  \ sip sets the tone for the day: sharp, bitter, electrifying.\n\nI enjoyed my cup,\
  \ packed my gear and started walking. Two hours later, I reached a striking scenic\
  \ viewpoint. It was a flat boulder that stood out from the side of the cliff, overhanging\
  \ the largest part of the river, about 200 feet below. I sat there in a half lotus\
  \ position to admire the view, quickly diving into the elements. The water was flowing\
  \ fast beneath me, the jungle breathing on my back, the wind blowing in my face;\
  \ Nature can be overwhelming, yet powerfully enchanting. I focused on my breath\
  \ and gently sank into a calm meditative state. \n\nEmerging an hour later, I saw\
  \ him: a tall young Indian man standing on the other side of the river. Like many\
  \ Indians in the eyes of a westerner, he looked similar to his peers: long black\
  \ hair, tall, thin, dark skin and black piercing eyes. He was wearing the traditional\
  \ white robe, a brown fabric shoulder bag and carrying his \u201Cpoporo\u201D, that\
  \ pear-shaped wooden fruit that serves as their ID. Indians of the Sierra Nevada\
  \ have a rite of passage to manhood: they meditate in a hut with their spiritual\
  \ leader, without food nor sleep\u2026for 3 days. If they make it, they get a poporo,\
  \ the right to start a family and an active role in their community. I remember\
  \ my last 3 sleepless nights, working to meet a deadline and ending up in the hospital.\
  \ He made it out of that hut, at only 12 years-old. I wonder what he saw, what he\
  \ drank, coffee perhaps.\n\nThe man was staring at me intensely from across the\
  \ river. I maintained eye contact; calm and still. He smiled, slowly nodded, and\
  \ walked away. For a moment we shared something, I felt it; a mutual love for Mother\
  \ Nature maybe. I stayed on that rock, content; taking his smile and salute as a\
  \ sign of acceptance. I am grateful, to be welcomed by a local and to have interacted\
  \ in a language beyond words. It is fascinating and comforting to see how two strangers,\
  \ who outwardly share nothing in common, can bond over a moment of quiet contemplation.\
  \ I held that thought as I saw other hikers coming my way, and greeted them with\
  \ a genuine smile, secretly wishing to convey with my eyes what I felt through the\
  \ Indian\u2019s."
