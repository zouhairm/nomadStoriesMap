Text: "\"Ateesh lost,\" my headphones spoke into my ears, after my eponymous phone\
  \ ran out of battery. Irritated, I threw it aside. \n\"Why don't you leave this\
  \ place for the city?\" I asked Hasan, our local guide in the archipelago of Socotra\
  \ off the coast of Yemen.\nIt was an irresponsible question, only a careless tourist\
  \ could care to ask. It was our first day. Jules had forced me to join him, after\
  \ Omar ditched our Dubai plans from Jeddah. \n\"What do you mean?\" Hasan asked,\
  \ still chewing on 'khat', a stimulant made up of leaves from a locally grown shrub.\
  \ \nI thought it was an obvious question. We had barely managed to arrange enough\
  \ fuel for the plane to make it back to Sa'naa, where the Houthi rebels had taken\
  \ over the capital. Yemen was officially running out of water, and a civil war had\
  \ broken out. Hadiboh, the only settlement in Socotra, itself was crumbling. Incomplete\
  \ and dilapidated buildings dotted either side of the road. Only the side facing\
  \ the roads were painted. \nOver the next few days, the island of Socotra unravelled\
  \ itself. Pristine coastal waters shimmered in different shades of blue and green.\
  \ White sandy beaches outlined the island in sharp contrast. A mountain ridge gradually\
  \ escalated from the coastal flat lands. Little patch of grass peppered the otherwise\
  \ barren landscape. The place felt alien in a very calming sort of way \u2013 that\
  \ comes from being a witness to something extraordinary. Most of the flora and fauna\
  \ was endemic. At the Dixsam plateau, the dragon blood trees looked like mushrooms\
  \ that had grown as big as trees. The bottle trees had stout white bellies at the\
  \ base, thin necks and little sprouts of green at the top. At Dihamri, Hasan excitedly\
  \ pointed us at the various marvels of the coral reef, as he dived several meters\
  \ down below us without any gear. At Qalandasiya, a vast expanse of white sands\
  \ and turquoise waters, till as far as one could see greeted us. There was no one\
  \ else there. At night, Hasan woke me up in the tent pointing up at the kaleidoscopic\
  \ view of the stars, the constellations and the Milky Way. I felt small. Terribly\
  \ small. The shiny little diamonds glittered happily at my realisation. \n\u201C\
  This is all we have,\u201D Hasan said. \u201CThe trees, blue waters, white sands,\
  \ the night sky. This is why you have come. And without you, there is no us. Without\
  \ us, there is no Socotra.\u201D\n \u201CSo, Mr. Ateesh. Do you want to leave already?\u201D\
  \ Hasan asked with a wide grin on his face.\n\u201CNot yet,\u201D I said, humbled.\n\
  \u201CMe neither, my friend.\u201D"
