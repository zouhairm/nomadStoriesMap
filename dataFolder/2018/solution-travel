Text: "Somewhere I read that life is not meant to be lived in one place, and I couldn\u2019\
  t agree more. I was raised by my mom in Peru, with occasional visits to the US thanks\
  \ to my parents\u2019 separation. Right after finishing high school I jumped into\
  \ college and studied veterinary medicine, I still believe I should have taken a\
  \ gap year to travel and to see the world and think my career path through. After\
  \ working as a vet for some time in Peru I decided to leave everything behind, so\
  \ I could grow in my career and personally. This decision pushed me to my limits\
  \ in so many ways; I was far away from my family, pets and friends for months, without\
  \ really knowing when I will see them again, cultural shock, out of my comfort zone,\
  \ surrounded by other people with very different opinions and points of view, and\
  \ absolutely everything was different about the way of living; in Germany recycling\
  \ is a national sport and losing time a crime and getting stressed over the most\
  \ insignificant detail is a hobby. I had traveled to many places before, but it\
  \ is a different thing to travel as a tourist in a country than it is to live in\
  \ it, and I have done several internships, yet this was different, this was trying\
  \ to build a complete life in another continent, with all the paperwork and forms\
  \ that come with it. I have to admit it was, and still is, a very hard time, it\
  \ really drove me to the edge of all my senses. There were weeks I didn\u2019t think\
  \ I would manage to hold on and thought about going home every hour of the day,\
  \ but one thing turned out to be the solution. Every city is unique and has its\
  \ own charms, and a great thing in Europe is the facility to travel; flight tickets\
  \ are usually cheap inside of Europe and the trains are simply magnificent. For\
  \ me there are few things as pleasurable and relaxing as listening to my favorite\
  \ music in the train while looking at the landscape pass. Visiting castles and museums,\
  \ trekking, comparing the different installations and management of animals in the\
  \ different zoos, attending unique city events or just walking down the streets\
  \ and admiring the buildings and city or town itself are some of my favorite things\
  \ to do, while doing so I find myself blissfully relaxed, the week behind me and\
  \ forgotten. Visiting wonderful places and afterwards writing about it has become\
  \ my catharsis, keeping diaries since high school has proven very therapeutical\
  \ for me afterall, which is why I will choose travel and writing over any other\
  \ decision."
