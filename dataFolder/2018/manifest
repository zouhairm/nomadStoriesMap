Text: "As I stepped off of the bus, echoes of chatter from a distance clouded my vision.\n\
  Surely I was at the right place.\nI looked around in search of someone.\nSomething.\n\
  Anything.\nFamiliar.\nAll I could see were blank faces.\nI stood still.\nA wave\
  \ of fear hit me.\nI felt my chest tighten.\nI seeked for comfort.\nSafety.\n\u201C\
  Are you coming?\u201D\nA tall, dark figure stood before me.\n\u201CI said, are you\
  \ coming?\u201D\nI opened my mouth to respond.\nYet, nothing came out.\nI nodded.\
  \ Took a deep breath of the muggy air and proceeded towards the court.\n\u201CWe\u2019\
  re glad that you came out.\u201D\nAnother figure mumbled.\n\u201CSuit up. You got\
  \ next.\u201D\nStill, I was unable to summon words for a response.\nI scurried to\
  \ the closest seat I could find.\nFrantically, I opened my bag.\nWhy was I so nervous?\n\
  As I pulled my shoes out, I took another deep breath.\n\u201CDidn\u2019t mean to\
  \ scare you earlier, kid. My name\u2019s J.\u201D\nHe reached out his fist.\nWithout\
  \ exchanging a word, I dabbed his fist.\n\u201CDon\u2019t be frightened. The courts\
  \ always welcome new players.\u201D\nSurprisingly, J\u2019s words were nothing but\
  \ reassuring.\nThey were exactly what I needed to hear.\n\u201CI...I...I guess I\
  \ feared taking risks.\u201D I stuttered.\nImmediately, I wanted to take that back.\n\
  He might start to judge me.\nOr...even worse\u2026\nUnderestimate me.\n\u201CUntil\
  \ today!\u201D\nI managed to squeeze in before he could hit me with a reply.\nHe\
  \ chuckled.\n\u201CBring that mentality to the court and we\u2019re sure to get\
  \ that W.\u201D\nHe smiled at me pleasantly and got up.\nI quickly jumped up...ready\
  \ for the game to begin.\nI heard resounding giggles from the bleachers.\nBehind\
  \ me a group of children were watching me embarrass myself in front of J.\n\u201C\
  Hehehe, go break some ankles!\u201D One of the girls yelled.\n\u201CYou can outrun\
  \ #20!\u201D Another one shrieked.\nI was the worst ball handler!\nI never had the\
  \ best endurance!\nBut, I felt admired by these spectators.\nI felt obligated to\
  \ work hard for them.\n\u201CI\u2019ll do what I can.\u201D I confessed.\n\u201C\
  No! You\u2019ll do what you only dreamed of.\u201D A little boy proclaimed.\nAnd\
  \ that hit me. \nHard.\nI\u2019ve always dreamed of migrating to a different country.\n\
  I\u2019ve always dreamed of communicating through the international language of\
  \ sport.\nI\u2019ve always dreamed of representing women on the court.\nI\u2019\
  ve always dreamed of proving everyone that ethnicity, age, height, and sex are trivial\
  \ when it comes to the game.\nI\u2019ve always dreamed of being a beacon for future\
  \ generations and giving them hope.\nEnergized, I ran towards the team.\nIt\u2019\
  s time.\n\u201CLet\u2019s get this W.\u201D We chanted."
