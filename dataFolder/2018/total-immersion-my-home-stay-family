Text: "The people we connect with are often the very foundation of our existence.\
  \ Sometimes, we meet special people who touch our hearts and change how we see the\
  \ world. My host family in Tanzania, the Gwaba\u2019s, are certainly some of those\
  \ people. \n\nI met the family while volunteering with International Citizen Service\
  \ (UK government initiative). Our team of us were building toilets at a local school\
  \ while getting the community interested in water sanitation and hygiene through\
  \ lessons, action days and meetings. \n\nMyself and my counterpart moved into the\
  \ house at night, so it wasn\u2019t until the next morning that I really began to\
  \ appreciate the beauty of the surroundings. An outdoor thatched kitchen where the\
  \ food was prepared.  Banana, palm and coconut tree\u2019s dotted around the grounds\
  \ with chickens and ducks roaming free throughout the day. Day by day I learnt their\
  \ routines. Water was gathered from a nearby well or hand pumps for cooking, cleaning\
  \ and drinking. The sandy grounds swept with a reed broom each morning, and the\
  \ homes interior was mopped. I admired the pride they poured into everything they\
  \ owned and all tasks they completed. While living with them, I made their routines\
  \ a part of mine. \n\nAs well as their routines, I learnt some cooking techniques.\
  \ I\u2019ve always loved cooking and learning these traditional techniques with\
  \ mama on weekends was a great pleasure. There was a little laugh when I tried grating\
  \ coconuts or stirring ugali for the first time between the local mamas who would\
  \ congregate at the Gwaba\u2019s. They would laugh even harder while watching me\
  \ try to hand wash my clothes. The laughter was never mean and they would always\
  \ lend a hand to show me the best way to complete these tasks. \n\nI was touched\
  \ by the kindness of the family and the neighbours. Even though we spoke with different\
  \ tongues, we accommodated each other, learnt about each other and perhaps learnt\
  \ about ourselves too. It was hard to say goodbye, but that meant I was leaving\
  \ something special. A family who had opened their lives to me and took me in with\
  \ open arms.  \n\nI built a special connection with the Gwaba\u2019s. It\u2019s\
  \ not often we get the chance to stay in a homestay: our trips are too short to\
  \ build such relationships because we have get back to the office or must move onward\
  \ and explore new places.  I would say, for anyone given the opportunity: jump in.\
  \ You\u2019ll be immersed into another way of life and most importantly form a new\
  \ family far from a place you might call home."
