Text: "My boyfriend and I found ourselves in La Paz for Semana Santa, the holiest\
  \ week of the year for Catholics, as it precedes Easter. I couldn\u2019t wait to\
  \ show my Jewish boyfriend the pomp and circumstance of my faith in a country where\
  \ 76% identify as Catholic. I had been excitedly looking forward to Semana Santa\
  \ traditions since the beginning of our travels; something that I had never planned\
  \ was the possibility of having to share my holiest week with that of my partner.\n\
  Unlike Christmas, the Jewish holiday of Passover never tries to claim that it is\
  \ the most wonderful time of the year. Cutting out most grains from your diet might\
  \ be fine for the gluten intolerant but can be excruciating for the carb dependent\
  \ vegetarian traveling through South America. Despite being the goy in the relationship,\
  \ I follow dietary restrictions over Passover. I like to think it shows respect.\
  \ All great reasons unless you\u2019re standing in the middle of the square in front\
  \ of the Basilica of San Francisco, in the middle of Easter week surrounded by tents\
  \ and tents full of sweet baked treats. The city of La Paz smells of cookies, sweet\
  \ breads and a sickly sweet purple corn drink called api. Large crowds of people\
  \ dressed in white clutch pastries in excitement for the messiahs resurrection at\
  \ sunset. I want to be joyful, but all I can think of is my ravenous belly. I need\
  \ a moment to rest and eat before joining the celebration with open arms and a full\
  \ stomach.\nThen we saw her. A very large woman with a sunhat made from starched\
  \ white lace. She was sitting in the corner of the square with a small cooler and\
  \ an eight by ten piece of paper simply labeled \u201CHumitas\u201D. Humitas are\
  \ made from corn meal steamed in a corn husk. The woman was blas\xE9 as she described\
  \ her wares to us, surrounded by children marching by in bright multicolored outfits.\
  \ We could chose from the two types of humitas, savory or sweet, that she had for\
  \ sale. We of course chose both. The savory one tasted like dense cornbread whose\
  \ texture would shame the cornbread I left behind in Georgia. The sweet humita knocked\
  \ me over with its mochi-like consistency studded with raisins, cinnamon and honey.\
  \ We both had one of each, creating a pleasant belly ache that lasted for the rest\
  \ of the day.\nA quick search could have told us that humitas use pork lard as a\
  \ binding agent, a food product neither of us should be eating. In traveling and\
  \ relationships alike a little compromise is needed to discover what you might be\
  \ missing."
