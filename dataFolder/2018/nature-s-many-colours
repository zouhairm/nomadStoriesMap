Text: "Tyrone made his way to the ticket counter, and after a brief while, entered\
  \ the plane and took his seat. As soon as he sat down, he was overcome by nervousness.\
  \ Tyrone was nervous because he felt he had a problem. You see, the problem with\
  \ Tyrone was that his skin was of a darker colour than that of most average Americans.\
  \ And even though he had tried really hard to gel in with the crowd, people always\
  \ reminded him that he was different. And they would tease him about this. And make\
  \ fun of him. \n\n\"Maa, when my own countrymen don\u2019t like me, why will the\
  \ people of some other country like me?\" \nTyrone suddenly had a flashback of the\
  \ time when he asked his mother this, and upon seeing her nervous face, knew she\
  \ was a little scared, too.\n\"Life is difficult\", muttered Tyrone to himself,\
  \ and slept off.\n\nUpon landing in Keflavik, he collected his luggage and made\
  \ his way out of the airport. It was 5 in the morning and very dark.  Suddenly,\
  \ he saw a big, burly man holding a placard with his name written on it, and went\
  \ up to him.\n\n\"You Tyrone?\", the man asked in a gruff voice. \n\"Yes\"\n\"Well,\
  \ hop into the car. It's an hour\u2019s drive to the hotel.\"\n\nAfter about 10\
  \ minutes of driving, the big man said \u201CMy name is Aron. You don\u2019t talk\
  \ much?\u201D\n\u201CI do\u201D, said Tyrone. \n\u201CThen why don\u2019t you?\u201D\
  \n\u201CI\u2019m nervous.\u201D\n\u201CAbout what?\u201D\n\u201CMe mum told me to\
  \ not draw too much attention to meself\u201D\n\u201CWhy?\u201D\n\u201CBecause of\
  \ my skin colour.\u201D\n\u201CWhat\u2019s wrong with it?\u201D\n\u201CYou don\u2019\
  t think I look weird? I am black!\u201D\n\u201CShush, boy. There\u2019s nothing\
  \ weird in being black.\u201D\n\u201CWell, YOU\u2019RE weird. How can you not find\
  \ my skin colour weird?\u201D\n\u201CYou want to see the Northern Lights, yes? Well,\
  \ look outside the window.\u201D\nTyrone looked outside, and was spellbound. It\
  \ was better than anything he had ever seen. It seemed as if the Gods of the Vikings\
  \ were busy fighting their majestic wars in the sky. \n\u201CYou see, son, we Icelanders\
  \ are blessed with so many colours in our lives. Nature has taught us that every\
  \ colour is unique, and hence important. The beauty of one colour comes out only\
  \ when it is seen with another colour. You, Tyrone, are just like those colours\
  \ that you are seeing right now.\u201D\n\nAnd listening to Aron and looking up at\
  \ the magical sky, Tyrone, for the first time in his life, felt comfortable in his\
  \ own skin. And that was the last thing he had expected in a strange land full of\
  \ unknown people. At this moment, Tyrone felt infinite."
