Text: "What makes truly great going abroad to different countries is the unique possibility\
  \ of changing your life. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t travel a lot. I am a Northerner\
  \ (a Spanish guy from the North), and we Northerners don\u2019t like changing a\
  \ lot. We are stable, right? We are gloomy, serious, responsible people... and I\
  \ guess I have to say it just to believe it myself.\nLast thing I expected when\
  \ I travelled to Alaska in the late sixties was that I would be coming back to Spain.\
  \ I spend there two years studying at the University and my plan was to stablished\
  \ in the States. However, at the end of that period, I had to face the decision\
  \ of coming back to Spain. I said goodbye to Fairbanks, to the helicopters, the\
  \ wild bears, even to the gun I used to carry at the time (fuck guns, did I already\
  \ said that?). So I, a Spanish who wanted to make fortune and glory in the States,\
  \ had to say goodbye to the American Dream (if so, why the fuck did I go to Alaska\
  \ in the first place?, you would ask yourself; I\u2019ll just say that anyplace\
  \ was good at the time, late 60s, to leave Spain). \nSo when I come back I discover\
  \ myself in the South of Spain (did I say I\u2019m a Northerner?), like a stranger,\
  \ cause we Northerners are absolute foreigners in the South of Spain. Two countries\
  \ really. In the South they are happier. We are for sure gloomier and more pessimistic\u2026\
  \ who on earth is not to be pessimistic taking into account what is going on in\
  \ the world? So I was there in the South, in a part time job (not what you should\
  \ expect after a two year\u2019s Master in Geology in the University of Alaska),\
  \ in a lost city which I can\u2019t even remember its name, just thinking of doing\
  \ the job, take the money, and get back as soon a possible to the gloomier world\
  \ of the North. Then one day you enter a shop to buy a guitar (that\u2019s what\
  \ we loners do: play guitars, sing songs and read paperbacks) just to discover that\
  \ little fucking thing called love that usually turns our world up and down. That\
  \ was the last thing I expected. Let\u2019s say that\u2026 that local connection\
  \ changed my life and make me forget the North. I\u2019ve lived in the South since\
  \ then. A happy life, I should say\u2026 at least as happy as a Northerner as me\
  \ can be, always worried about death and other natural catastrophes. But, lucky\
  \ me, guitars and paperbacks always help."
