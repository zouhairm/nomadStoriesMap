Text: "July 2015. I was in Haiti with my father, my first time in the country of my\
  \ ancestors. After a week spent traveling from city to city, going from Port-au-Prince,\
  \ to Jacmel and Petit Goave, participating in a literary festival organised by one\
  \ of his friends, we had decided to take a few days off to go up north, Okap, to\
  \ visit the house where my grandmother was born and raised. The estimated time for\
  \ the travel was of 6 hours, crossing through the never-ending haitian mountains.\
  \ As we say in creole, behind every mountain, there\u2019s a mountain. There we\
  \ were, then, sitting in the bus that would take us from the capital to the Cap,\
  \ on a road that was smaller than the bus itself and didn't have a gard - a fact\
  \ that my father, who has vertigo and was sitting next to the window, was attempting\
  \ to forget about. The driver had put on Kompa music and was echoing the trumpet\
  \ beat with the vehicule honk. \n\nWe drove through a few small villages and had\
  \ to stop on various occasions; to let a goat cross the road and because a wedding\
  \ was taking place in the middle of the public place that the road was crossing.\
  \ We finally made it to the Cap, exhausted, but trilled. A taxi driver came to us\
  \ and proposed to take us to the hotel. He presented himself: \u201CI'm taxi Savior\u201D\
  \ and gave us his card in case we needed transportation again, saying that it would\
  \ be a pleasure to help us. \n\nOnce we entered the hotel, my father went to the\
  \ counter to check us in. However, we were told that there had been a problem with\
  \ our reservation and that there was no trace of it nor the fact that we had already\
  \ paid for our room. My dad, who had a copy of the receipt in his electronic mailbox,\
  \ asked for the wifi code, so he could send it to the hostess by mail. She gave\
  \ it to us and invited us to go take place in our room, to unpack our things. The\
  \ room was very cozy, with two white beds and a little night table between them.\
  \ We had access to a small refrigerator, which allowed us to keep for a few days\
  \ the fresh mangoes and juice that we would buy later on.\n\nOn the following day,\
  \ we went to the reception to make sure that everything was fine and that they had\
  \ received our receipt. Once we got there, the hostess (the same one that welcomed\
  \ us the day before), told my dad: \u201CYou remind me of someone I've known\u201D\
  . \u201CWhom?\u201D, did my father asked. \u201CMarc P\xE9an\u201D, said she. \u201C\
  He's my uncle\u201D, my dad told her. \u201CWell, he's my grandfather!\u201D, she\
  \ said. That day, I met my cousin."
