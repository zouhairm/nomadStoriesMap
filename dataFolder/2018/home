Text: "'Cheer up lah, Oliva. She's Laoban in the Restoran, she's the boss there,'\
  \ Mrs. Soh urged me as she drove back home.\nIt was my last night with my foster\
  \ family in KL, Malaysia. As usual we went out to eat and this time it's Chinatown's\
  \ famed Jalan Alor. The street roared with rage for it was dinnertime, and across\
  \ the street, the intoxicating smells of grilling satay filled visitors' sensations\
  \ with amazing temptations. Mrs. Soh took me to a distinctive Chinese restaurant\
  \ - a couple of tables in a space with a bustling and buzzing kitchen. And an excellent\
  \ Chinese taste. The heartwarming comfort food dumplings brought me back to my mother's\
  \ dinner table. Mrs. Soh was also like my mother; I felt comfortable around her.\
  \ Not just because we could communicate both in Mandarin and English, but also because\
  \ she was a loving and caring mother, she has already given me wonderful memories\
  \ during my short period of homestay.\nI called her Malaixiya Mama (Malaysian Mummy)\
  \ and after a long conversation with her, I promised to see her again when the exchange\
  \ program ended. Then we went for a drink, and she suddenly remembered something,\
  \ 'Ah, you know - the woman at the Restoran is Miantian (Burmese). Want to see?'\n\
  For a moment, I was surprised. I'd met scholarship students and tourists from Myanmar\
  \ but not a foreign worker. So I nodded.\n'Do you speak Burmese?'\n'Yeah, of course.\
  \ Are you Burmese?'\n'Yes, nice to meet you. I don't really know it's a good greeting\
  \ \u2026'\nIt was the cashier and her name was Tin. I might not know she was Burmese\
  \ if Mrs. Soh told me. After a little Burmese chat I learnt that Tin's been working\
  \ in KL for five years and she's pure Burmese; she didn't even know a single Chinese\
  \ word. She's supporting her parents back in Yangon, my native city. I could imagine\
  \ how challenging life was for her. Recently the foul relations between two countries\
  \ menaced Burmese workers and refugees. Remembering terrible stories I heard, I\
  \ was constantly asking myself a bunch of questions. Why couldn't she live together\
  \ with her family? Why?\nI couldn't enjoy my happy hours anymore; I couldn't return\
  \ her smiles; I couldn't help thinking. I was crying inside. It would be a curse\
  \ to labour in a strangers' land. It's good to know that Tin was like the manager,\
  \ at least. 'She earned a lot lah. Don't worry,' Mrs. Soh whispered me.\nThe tension\
  \ needed relieving so I turned and smiled, 'Thank you.' I just wished people like\
  \ Tin could meet people like Mrs. Soh and feel at home."
