Text: "I wanted to go to Argentina, Chile and Uruguay for a while. I do not care if\
  \ I travel alone, although traveling with someone you love or, at least, have lot\
  \ in common make discovering new places a better thing to do.\nIt was an agreement\
  \ to go to Buenos Aires in that year and spend the reveillon there. I wasn't expecting\
  \ so much heat, to be frank. Haven't been to Argentina previously, I though it would\
  \ be more cold than S\xE3o Paulo, my home city. My mistake. The heat was alike the\
  \ worst summer I \u201Cenjoyed\u201D at Rio de Janeiro.\nAnyway, I was clumsy not\
  \ to check the weather AND not to make reservations for the reveillon dinner. At\
  \ the \u201Clast  minute\u201D we decide to take a peak on a newspaper and found\
  \ several reveillon dinner services and picked the best price and description. The\
  \ chosen place was called Almanza and it was located at Palermo Viejo.\nOnce there,\
  \ we were very well received and had a splendid dinner. But, after midnight, we\
  \ were informed that no buses were available at that time anda that picking a cab\
  \ would be a feat.\nOur gar\xE7on talked to his boss and they called a cab, but,\
  \ for there were many patrons in need, they hurried to get it the taxi and go to\
  \ hotel. I complained that I haven't payed the bill but they said: you come back\
  \ tomorrow and pay off the debt. So we did and so we cabe back in the next day.\
  \ My companion at that travel was in love with a tiny salt shaker they have, so\
  \ I asked to put one of those in the bill so I could gift it to my girl. The wouldn't\
  \ charge for the salt shaker.\nBeen Brazilian and had been \u201Ctaught\u201D that\
  \ Argentinians didn't like us Brazilians (mostly because of the Cisplatine War and\
  \ lately for the soccer rivalry), I was very much surprised that they treat us so\
  \ kind and were so confident I would be there to pay the bill."
