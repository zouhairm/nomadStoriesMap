Text: "My flight landed at around 4:30 p.m. at Suvarnabhumi airport on a Sunday afternoon.\
  \ The weather was partly cloudy that day with the sun shining through at intervals.\
  \ It didn\u2019t come as a surprise as it was the month of June which is the monsoon\
  \ season in South East Asia so rain and thunderstorms was pretty much on the cards.\
  \ It had already started to drizzle when we got down and the weather looked grim\
  \ so I really wanted to reach my destination early.  \n I rushed out of the airport\
  \ and found myself a cab. The cab driver was an affable middle aged Thai man who\
  \ greeted me warmly. Surprisingly enough he couldn\u2019t speak a word of English\
  \ which really came as a shock knowing the number of British and American visitors\
  \ Thailand hosts every year. Thankfully Google Voice translate came to our rescue\
  \ and we were finally able to communicate. I heaved a huge sigh of relief at that\
  \ as before most of our conversation was getting lost in translation and I was really\
  \ unsure whether he was getting the directions correctly. It was a long drive from\
  \ the airport to my hostel on Samsen Road and I enjoyed every bit of it chatting\
  \ all the way with my enthusiastic cab driver, talking about anything and everything\
  \ even going the extent of sharing details of his personal life with a complete\
  \ stranger.\n    He finally parked his car in front of Oh Bangkok Hostel, my new\
  \ address in Thailand, looking chic with the picnic garden, armchairs and sun terraces\
  \ right outside the main building where you can grab a few drinks with your friends\
  \ while enjoying the outside view. I walked inside into the lobby area and after\
  \ completing the necessary formalities headed straight up to my room to freshen\
  \ up. \n   I was staying in a mixed dorm on the top floor and at that time had about\
  \ 8-9 people sharing the room with me from different countries. Some of them left\
  \ during my stay while others came in to take their place. There was always a buzz\
  \ about the place which I really liked. I had come to know most of the local shop\
  \ owners in person during my time there, learnt all the alleyways and shortcuts\
  \ interlinking the roads and was even confident enough to redirect a lost traveler\
  \ on the correct path. Khaosan Road too was a big hit with me especially for its\
  \ colorful & vibrant nightlife.\n  I can proudly say that nowhere else in Bangkok\
  \ would you find this perfect mix. I fell in love with that place so much so that\
  \ I lived in 3 different hostels in the same area. Strange isn\u2019t it when a\
  \ boring work trip can make you this happy?"
