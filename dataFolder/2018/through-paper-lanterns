Text: "What was I thinking? Months earlier I had agreed to a destination wedding at\
  \ the beckoning of my soon to be husband and was now sitting on a packed Air China\
  \ flight on its way to Bangkok. The most international travel I had ever done up\
  \ to this point was staying at my friend\u2019s timeshare in Ensenada, Baja California;\
  \ and for a native San Diegan, that was about as exotic as an Austinite visiting\
  \ El Paso. I knew I did not want a cliche beach wedding, but I  wanted a white wedding\
  \ gown at least; every American girl\u2019s right of passage, and something that\
  \ I have now left completely behind.\nIt\u2019s Christmas Day back in the States.\
  \ A sense of loss comes over me. Ok, so we\u2019re doing this. Deep breath. Our\
  \ wedding host Soomchit, and her husband pick us up from the airport. Her husband,\
  \ a Canadian, who had been living in Thailand for the past 11 years, told us when\
  \ asked why he left Canada for the bustling streets of Chiang Mai, smiled jovially\
  \ and answered, \u201CYou\u2019ll see.\u201D After our flight and layover in Beijing,\
  \ all I can muster is the thought of food and sleep. \nNew Year\u2019s Eve is an\
  \ absolute marvel in Chiang Mai. It\u2019s an all-out market, street festival, concert,\
  \ fireworks show, and spectacle. The fever-pitch of the celebration is pure bliss.\
  \ There is so much to take in that your very being is mesmerized by its beauty and\
  \ it instantly feels like someplace that you somehow intimately know.\nBetween the\
  \ resplendent blind man perched on a stool in the middle of the street singing into\
  \ his very own karaoke speaker, a Pomeranian wearing a top-hat and sunglasses, and\
  \ the exquisite \u201Cladyboys\u201D in their finest Vegas Showgirl costumes (which\
  \ are flawless, by the way), you learn very quickly that you are exactly where you\
  \ should be at that very moment.\nWould I like to hold this monkey in a SpongeBob\
  \ onesie, possibly ridden with fleas, rabies or syphilis for 10 Bhat? In my revelry,\
  \ I answer, yes, as a matter of fact, I would, thank you.\nPaper lanterns as tall\
  \ as I am are being lit by torches and, once let go into the sky, they begin to\
  \ look like hundreds of tiny stars that you may actually reach.\nAs we walk back\
  \ to our room for our pre-nuptial night's sleep, the fireworks start and are so\
  \ low and loud, that you consider taking cover. The celebration is at its zenith\
  \ - it must be midnight. As I lay in what was arguably the most uncomfortable bed\
  \ of my life, there is nowhere I\u2019d rather be. I\u2019m in absolute awe of you\
  \ Chiang Mai - and we haven\u2019t even begun our honeymoon together\u2026"
