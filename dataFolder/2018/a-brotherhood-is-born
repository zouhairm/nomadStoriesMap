Text: "It is an enjoyable morning and the coffee break is coming to an end. The sound\
  \ of spoons scratching mugs\u2019 bottoms have ceased and they now lay lifeless\
  \ on the table. \nThe NGO has its headquarters between the south eastern Dutch cities\
  \ of Venlo and Tegelen, where this former monastery stood its feet on the ground.\
  \ A fortress built to the Almighty. Times have changed and even while neither monks\
  \ nor nuns live here anymore, this colossal house of God still hosts many volunteers\
  \ and dreams.\nA visitor is talking to the leaders of the community, only that this\
  \ time there is something mesmerizing about this person. He is certainly entering\
  \ his forties, has the unwary will of a teenager and a tanned skin not achieved\
  \ by sun bathing in a beach, but by working in the open air.\nThe outsider soon\
  \ became a volunteer and like all newcomers, Humphrey is assigned to the garden\
  \ area, where I am another piece of the team work. Given I have some months here,\
  \ my supervisors gave me the task of explaining all new volunteers what is to be\
  \ done in the \u2018tuin\u2019. \u201CMom would be proud\u201D I think to myself\
  \ with a foolish smile drawn in my face. Not that I enjoy showing the same things\
  \ time after time to the parade of faces that has gone in front of me in such a\
  \ short span of time.\nEventually, we got to talk to each other while removing weed,\
  \ uprooting potatoes or collecting beans & strawberries. He is a Dutch citizen who\
  \ fled to Greece, got a piece of land and enjoyed of the freedom he lacked in his\
  \ homeland. He would lit his living space in the night with candles as he had no\
  \ electricity, neither running water had he, yet had the happiness he couldn\u2019\
  t find elsewhere.\nWe meet in the Netherlands, where he would return every now and\
  \ then when there is not much money left in his pockets to satisfy his modest needs.\
  \ Good Humphrey is a non-religious, apolitical individual\u2026 in various ways\
  \ he is his own master.\nGerman border is hardly four hundred meters away. We often\
  \ ride our bikes (did I mention we are in the Netherlands?) to the neighbouring\
  \ town of Kaltenkirchen to do the groceries. Sometimes we lay on a green meadow\
  \ or seat in front of the old local church. Location is only an excuse to slow down\
  \ and have a conversation from which I always take more than Humphrey does. He would\
  \ share his life experience on simple things up to complex issues alike.\n\u201C\
  Brother, what would you do with a handful of seeds of hope? Get them carried away\
  \ by the wind or have them sown in your fertile Greek soil?\u201D"
