Text: "Today is my birthday and I'm traveling solo.  After a freezing night\u2019\
  s sleep I decide not to stay another night. The desert is mysterious and, at the\
  \ same time charming, but two days are enough for me. It's 5 am. I run to the camels\
  \ to ensure I get one to return to the nearest village. Yesterday there were no\
  \ camels for all travellers. Today I got one and finally I can wear my new blue\
  \ Berber scarf to avoid swallowing endless amounts of fine orange sand and to protect\
  \ myself from the burning sun. Riding a camel does not turn out to be a comfortable\
  \ experience. I feel awkward on the saddle and this experience quickly becomes very\
  \ painful. Two hours of mixed feelings between the slow torture of the ride and\
  \ the indescribable beauty of the desert sunrise. I just met Dino, Bianca, Andrea,\
  \ and Gabor. We discuss where to go next: Fez and the world famous labyrinthian\
  \ medina. Dino is already familiar with the Moroccan way to do business and tells\
  \ us \u201CLet\u2019s walk! The price is too high!\". I don't have a whole week\
  \ to walk as far as Fez, and I'm not sure I would survive either. It is my birthday\
  \ and I decide not to worry and go with the flow.  A taxi appears out of nowhere.\
  \ We know that in Morocco there are no coincidences. Five of us (and the driver)\
  \ in one car. We arrive in Midelt after crossing several oasis adorned with green\
  \ palm trees and golden camp fires, deserted and inhospitable areas, small houses\
  \ made with mud covered with blue plastic. We will sleep in a 5 euro room with Wi-Fi\
  \ and hot shower. Today is my birthday and it would be expected to sleep in a luxury\
  \ room. But no, I'll spend these last hours with four people that I just met and\
  \ that I\u2019ve no idea how special this day will be for me. After spending more\
  \ than four hours squashed in a taxi we decide to visit the old kasbah before going\
  \ to bed. Several children follow us. They aren't like those in Marrakesh. These\
  \ are sweet, humble and are surprised to see foreigners in their village. On the\
  \ way back to the hotel, I decide to buy a bag of sweets that costs me less than\
  \ 50 euro cents. Suddenly the news spreads across the village and I have dozens\
  \ of children around me. Dino tells me: \"Rui, what have you done?! This will be\
  \ a nightmare. They will eat you alive!\" Today is my birthday. Nobody knows. My\
  \ travel mates don't know.  Dino helps me sharing the sweets. The smiles of these\
  \ children, their big dark and happy eyes, they are the best birthday gift that\
  \ I have ever received."
