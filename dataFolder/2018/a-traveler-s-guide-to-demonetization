Text: "When you land in New Delhi to celebrate a wedding, there are certain expectations.\
  \ Bursts of red and gold fabric. Buildings adorned with marigolds. Rich burgundy\
  \ Mehndi on the palms of the betrothed. You prepare yourself for a weeks\u2019 worth\
  \ of biryani, butter chicken, and paneer makhani, washed down with plenty of liquor.\
  \ Indian weddings represent to me all that is great about India; the vibrant colours,\
  \ gluttonous food, the generosity and warmth of its people.\nWhat you don\u2019\
  t expect: the overnight demonetization of a country filled with roughly a billion\
  \ people. No one expects that. My travel companions and I would prepare ourselves\
  \ for the big day, while attempting to explore a city in chaos, where all of our\
  \ money was deemed useless overnight. \nImagine each missing Beatle was resurrected\
  \ for a one-night-only performance, and were distributing tickets at ATM machines.\
  \ Something like that. We tried dozens of machines with queues of peons sprawling\
  \ around the block before we decided there wasn\u2019t enough time in the day to\
  \ check every ATM in the city.\nDelhi can make anything happen. Should you find\
  \ yourself with 8000rs that you took out at the airport which no longer has any\
  \ monetary value, while on a 24 hour deadline, Delhi has your back. Sirf Bharat\
  \ Mein. \nWith a day to find saris for four indecisive wedding attendees, we took\
  \ ourselves to Babbu Market. A maze of all things glamorous, sold by men asking\
  \ for \u201Cyour best price, madam\u201D. We took a seat in a particular cave of\
  \ wonders, walls stacked to the ceiling with lenghas and dupattas. The Vendor pulled\
  \ his wares from all corners of the shop. Purple silk waterfalls, and turquoise\
  \ cotton tornadoes. He kindly showed the foreigners how to tie their saris, incidentally\
  \ at the same time I discovered the live photo function on my phone, which made\
  \ for some fantastic moving shots. We narrowed our pile of options down to a healthy\
  \ five before sheepishly asking the vital question. I used my broken Hindi to ask\
  \ if he would accept old money. He laughed. His fellow shopkeepers laughed.\n \u201C\
  No, madam, but I take card. You have card?\u201D\nWe all laughed.\nThere\u2019s\
  \ some serious joy to be found in limitations. Every restaurant boasting \u201C\
  card only please\u201D was a small haven. We were able to find pockets of repose\
  \ where we could make the memories we intended to on this pilgrimage. These havens\
  \ facilitated instant connections with local people, as they gleefully expressed\
  \ to us that through the madness, they would still accommodate us."
