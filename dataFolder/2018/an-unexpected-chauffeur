Text: "My roommate and I are in the ancient city of Naples, Italy - eating pizza,\
  \ naturally - in a restaurant we stumbled upon while waiting to catch a bus back\
  \ to Rome. The friendly and classically Italian owner seats us at a table outside\
  \ in a crooked, cobble-stoned alleyway. I'm recovering from the food poisoning I\
  \ got while in Paris, but the ingredients of the Neapolitan pizza - the dough, the\
  \ cheese, the pesto - is so fresh that my agitated digestive system is able to handle\
  \ it. \nWhile the meal was great, spectacular even, we were both slightly anxious\
  \ the whole time. While we wanted to savor our only meal in the birthplace of pizza\
  \ - and coming from New York, pizza holds a special place in my heart - we didn't\
  \ want to miss our bus, as we did that morning. Flashbacks of us sprinting through\
  \ the Termini station at the crack of dawn still frequent my nightmares. Our frantic\
  \ marathon only stopped when finally a man pointed to our ticket and notified us\
  \ that we were at the wrong station.\nWe wandered through the city for so long looking\
  \ for a pizza place that offered seating, so we could rest our swollen feet from\
  \ exploring the ruins of Pompeii all day, that we ultimately were clueless as to\
  \ how far away we were from the bus station. \"Who would know better than a local?\"\
  \ we thought. The restaurant owner was spritely and helpful, at least when it came\
  \ to choosing from the large selection of pizzas, so we turned to him for help.\
  \ We went inside to pay and asked how long it would take to walk to the bus station.\
  \ In broken English he said, \"Bus station? I take you there.\" The next thing I\
  \ know, as I look up from signing my receipt, he is putting on his bike helmet and\
  \ asks, \"Prego?\" No, I was not \"prego,\" but what the hell. He leads us into\
  \ the same alley to where his two-person motorcycle is. I selfishly take the seat\
  \ right behind our unexpected chauffeur and pushed myself so tightly up to him to\
  \ make us much room as possible for my roommate. She climbs on behind me and I clasp\
  \ her hands so tightly to me I could feel my knuckles nearly popping out of my skin.\
  \ \nThen we are off, flying down the streets of Naples, zipping in and out of cars,\
  \ smiling harder than I ever have in my 21 years of life. Partly because the wind\
  \ was blowing my cheeks back, but mostly because of the thrill. He dropped us off\
  \ right across the street from the bus station and zipped back to his restaurant.\
  \ We even had time to get gelato."
