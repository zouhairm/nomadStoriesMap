Text: "One April Fools day some years ago I started a journey from Buenos Aires. \
  \ The only planning at the time was a train trip to Bahia Blanca and a hostel booking\
  \ close to the train station there.  The next train that came through was five days\
  \ later.  From Viedma onwards I would wake up in the morning and ask myself, do\
  \ I stay or do I go, and if I go, in which direction?\n\nI chose to continue south\
  \ to Ushuaia rather than across to Bariloche.  From there I began my journey up\
  \ the Andes remembering that a friend of mine recommendedhorse riding in Chile around\
  \ Puerto Natales.  I thought to myself, yeah, that would be good, and left it at\
  \ that.\n\nAt Punto Arenas all the travellers going on to Puerto Natales had to\
  \ change over to another bus.  I was first on and was allocated a seat right at\
  \ the back.  One of the last passengers to get on was allocated the seat next to\
  \ me, an ex policeman turned Baqueano, a Chilean cowboy.  We started speaking and\
  \ he made fun of my Argentinean Spanish.  He told me he was looking forward to a\
  \ five day cattle muster coming up on the ranch he worked on.  I said \u201Creally?\u201D\
  \  He said \u201Creally.\u201D  I said \u201CI want to do that too.\u201D He said\
  \ \u201Creally?\u201D I said \u201Creally.\u201D  He gave me the contact details\
  \ for the ranch overseer.\n\nThe owner of my hostel contacted the overseer for me\
  \ and discovered that they knew each other from school days and so taking me to\
  \ the overseer\u2019s house was as much a reunion for them as a meeting for me,\
  \ but I got an agreement to be able to assist in the cattle muster that was coming\
  \ up.\n\nI found out that other horse riding options were unavailable at the time\
  \ due to the winter season setting in so this was the only available option.  A\
  \ travelling photographer who was going to hike through the Torres del Paine glacier\
  \ park, said enviously, \u201Cwhat you\u2019re doing is the real deal.\u201D\n\n\
  At the farm I met my baqueano friend who lent me one of his own horses and we set\
  \ off, 13 baqueanos and me, to go and find 622 Hereford cattle in the mountain territories\
  \ and bring them to the cattle station part of the ranch.  I was the first tourist\
  \ and first woman to go to these outposts, not even their wives had been there,\
  \ and they treated like one of the gang. They were really disappointed I did not\
  \ fall off crossing the river.  \n\nThree days later there was a group of tourists\
  \ at the main road taking photos and videos of us and he said, \u201Clook at those\
  \ gringos\u201D And I asked, \u201Cand what am I?\u201D  He replied, \u201Cyou\u2019\
  re a Gaucha.\u201D, an Argentinian cowgirl."
