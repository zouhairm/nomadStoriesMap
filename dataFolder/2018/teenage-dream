Text: "As I looked at the Maoris in front of me, I was still trying to understand\
  \ what happened.\n\nI had always been eager to discover New Zealand, that lonely\
  \ country in the southern Pacific Ocean. After months of preparations on both financial\
  \ and mindset levels, it became clearer what was awaiting. And the least I could\
  \ say was that this journey was different from what I had been expecting. \nIt had\
  \ only been a few weeks I was in New Zealand, discovering the beautiful wonders\
  \ of the country. And even though the landscapes were mind-blowing, very \u201C\
  Lord of the Rings\u201D-like, I had this awkward feeling each time I entered a big\
  \ city such as Auckland or Wellington. At first, I thought it was just the fact\
  \ of being alone on the routes for too long, without speaking to anyone. Then, it\
  \ hit me: I was upset and disappointed.\n\nI came to New Zealand for the Maoris,\
  \ for their culture, their customs and the landscapes. If I found very little of\
  \ what I had hoped for, I can\u2019t say my journey was a disappointment. It still\
  \ remains one of the best trips of my life. It just had to do with the fact I thought\
  \ I would see people getting Kirituhi tattoos the old fashion way, according to\
  \ ancestral traditions. I thought I would get to experience a H\u0101ng\u012B with\
  \ them, meaning cooking meat or fish with vegetables in a pit dug in the ground.\
  \ Arriving there and becoming one of the many tourists taking pictures without being\
  \ part of any of the experiences was very frustrating. Neither was I expecting to\
  \ find many \u2013 if not only \u2013 Maoris in the streets, every two meters away,\
  \ begging for money or meeting most of them in fast foods, binge-eating or waitressing.\
  \ \n\nIt became obvious I had to make peace with my teenage dream. New-Zealand\u2019\
  s customs and history weren\u2019t as preserved as they could have been. Maoris\
  \ weren\u2019t gone, they were just chewed up in the modern and occidental life\
  \ we had created, trying to make a living for themselves. Even though it was painful\
  \ to watch, I decided I would make the most out of this trip. I saw Wales, I met\
  \ locals, I learnt a few words in Maori I can\u2019t remember anymore.  It was adventurous.\
  \ It was breathtaking. It was lively. I almost lost myself as well as the car keys\
  \ before crossing from Picton to Wellington.\n\nI laughed, I cried, I got frustrated\
  \ and I got blessed. I met people I call friends today. I discovered a safe and\
  \ peaceful country despite everything. And I wouldn\u2019t change a thing to that\
  \ amazing trip which brought me self-awareness and joy."
