Text: "Well, I've always been the type of girl that dreams big and fights for what\
  \ it's worth. But sometimes, life looks at you and say: Oh, let's see if she can\
  \ handle the hard situations that are coming soon...\nI've studied English my whole\
  \ life, and I was never forced to do it; it was a natural and powerful desire to\
  \ communicate and understand how people see the world through other people's eyes.\
  \ So, when I was 24, I decided to prove to myself I could master English as well\
  \ as I thought I could. \nI started looking for English International Certifications\
  \ and I found TOEIC, and I was so glad I could take a test that could prove my proficiency\
  \ in the English language. Well, the test was far from my hometown, so I had to\
  \ go to Sao Paulo to take the test. I thought everything was perfect: I paid for\
  \ the test successfully, and started studying and preparing myself for this big\
  \ challenge. Oh, man...\nDays before the test, I planned everything: best routes,\
  \ buses, how much money I'd better have with me to go and come back home safely,\
  \ how much I would spend with foods and drinks, and even the possibility of resting\
  \ a little bit before the test starts. But some things don't just happen the way\
  \ we plan (most of the time).\nSo, on the test day, I took my first bus to go and\
  \ pursue my dream... And I lost my wallet. Yes, ladies and gentlemen: I LOST MY\
  \ WALLET. With all the money I had for the whole trip. When I got to the place I\
  \ had to take the second bus, I realized it wasn't there. I started freaking out,\
  \ but then I made my way back to see if I could find it somewhere. Thank God, the\
  \ bus driver in the first bus saw the wallet falling on the ground and gave it back\
  \ to me. \nIt seemed like that was about to be perfect, when I got confused with\
  \ the way I was going, and I ended up getting late for the test. The lady who received\
  \ me at the door started to tell me that it might not be possible for me to take\
  \ the test, and then... I started crying and begging her to let me do it! It took\
  \ me more than 5 hours to get to that place, and this test wasn't cheap, to lose\
  \ a whole fay and have to go back there some other time. Well, I guess the lady\
  \ felt for me and let me do the test! I was so happy, and I got a good score after\
  \ all. And if there's something i have learned from this day is that no matter how\
  \ much you plan something in your life, you will always have something unexpected\
  \ coming your way. The best thing is: be grateful for EVERYTHING that happens in\
  \ your life, there's always a lesson to be learned!"
