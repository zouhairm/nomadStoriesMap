Text: "\u201CHush, the hippos are resting,\u201D our guide, who also happens to be\
  \ the helmsman of the small boat we boarded, told us amid exciting chat between\
  \ my friend and I. \u201CThe last think they want when resting is noise,\u201D he\
  \ added.\nAt first I was frightened when I saw the hippos lying low and floating\
  \ on the water, with their eyes fixed on the oncoming wooden boat we were clutching\
  \ onto. My friend, having realized the nervousness in my low murmured voice and\
  \ having no idea of what we were doing, asked our guide if we are doing the right\
  \ thing. The guide smiled cheekily and told him, \u201Crelax. You will brush past\
  \ these beasts, have a close and good look at them and leave without any harm.\u201D\
  \nHippo point is a large viewing area on Lake Victoria in Kisumu city, Kenya and\
  \ when I first went there, the thought of going few meters near hippos never crossed\
  \ my mind because I had other ideas like eating fresh fish from the lake. Kisumu\
  \ is a tropical rainforest climate town with an average temperature of 22 degrees\
  \ Celsius and when the sun is hot, especially in the afternoons, the hippos resort\
  \ to taking respite from the sun. They usually lie in the shades of the tress that\
  \ grow in the water and lie on their chests in groups. \nWhen far from them, one\
  \ will assume they are a rock protruding from the water because of their massive\
  \ bodies brought together during this resting period. I couldn\u2019t believe when\
  \ the guide pointed his finger to a rock somewhere on one edge of the water and\
  \ said: \u201Cwe will start with those hippos resting there.\u201D\nOmollo, our\
  \ guide told us that the hippos lie in that state with no movement till the sun\
  \ goes down. You can have the closest view during the day and they will not move\
  \ unless you provoke them. We slowly and silently brushed our boat on their side,\
  \ viewed their intriguing body and shape, took pictures and moved on deeper into\
  \ the vast lake with hope of coming back to the hippos before 6 P.M. because at\
  \ 6 P.M., the hippos will be active and aggressive.\nThe excitement of exploring\
  \ the largest fresh water lake in Africa, of seeing the dreaded hyacinths that was\
  \ the making hard for the aquatic animals in the lake to live, of having a fresh\
  \ fish by the lakeside was all overtaking by these beautiful beasts with other ideas\
  \ \u2013 to wow us.\n\u201CLet us go back to the beautiful beasts,\u201D  I told\
  \ Omollo."
