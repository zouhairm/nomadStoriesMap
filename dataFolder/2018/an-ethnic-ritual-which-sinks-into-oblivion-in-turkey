Text: "Orange sunset beams were licking my face in warmth. This was supposed to be\
  \ the preview sense of the evening. Thursday evenings have a solemn meaning for\
  \ this Alevi village. Varied from Islam, Alevi religion is adopted by a minority\
  \ group in Turkey. In Tunceli \u2013one of the east Anatolian cities of Turkey,\
  \ Alevis and Kurds constitutes the vast majority of the population. For the very\
  \ reason, inhabitants of Tunceli had to fight against the authority of Turkey to\
  \ live according to their religion and to talk their language. A similar situation\
  \ occurred during the massacre towards locals in 1938. For the state, Tunceli was\
  \ an issue which needs to be solved immediately. After the massacre, assimilation\
  \ policies were brought into force for the survivors of the destruction. Over the\
  \ years, Alevis and Kurds scrambled for their rights at the cost of their lives.\
  \ Eventually, they did not let their ethnicity to die. So, I consider myself exceedingly\
  \ lucky for coming up to Alevism's most basic collective worship called Cem. As\
  \ a word, Cem comes from Arabic. It means to gather together, to collaborate. This\
  \ ritual can be orginazed by three people or a hundred people. An elderly person\
  \ who is called father or mother rules the ritual in a house.The purpose is to bring\
  \ all the living souls together, and allow them to touch the universal divine. Cem\
  \ is the basis ritual which is performed all together. It creates an atmosphere\
  \ by making all the souls of beings in there connect to each other. Everyone constitutes\
  \ a circle by their sitting places. The energy of all comes together and builds\
  \ a sacred energy. It is a way of purification. It lets us recollect the idea that\
  \ we all are a part of the nature. Through the ritual, they pray while singing and\
  \ dancing. Whirling is the basic element of the dance of Cem. The movement of whirling\
  \ was called Semah. Circular movement is seen  divine by most western philosophers\
  \ and easter mystics. Everthing starts at one point, and then comes back to the\
  \ point eventually. This was a spectacular experiment which was sinking into oblivion.\
  \ After all, I knew why authorities did not want these people in the country ruled\
  \ by them. For the locals, unity and togetherness were a way of worshipping. Authorities\
  \ knew that there is no great power except unity and love. Locals were experiencing\
  \ this philosophy every thursday evening. They were reminding themselves and the\
  \ world. This was the significant awareness which was given by the ritual in my\
  \ life."
