Text: "By helping the traveler, you help yourself.\nI am an architectural student\
  \ in the beautiful city of Almaty, which is located in the South of Kazakhstan.\
  \ Also, in addition to studying, I try to give my time to guests of our city from\
  \ different countries, working as a guide and showing them the city. After long\
  \ walks through the ancient streets and squares, telling about the local culture\
  \ and history of architecture of Kazakhstan - all my guests become very close friends.\
  \ In the same way, I manage to learn about other countries and learn their culture\
  \ from the representatives of these countries themselves.\nCommunication and exchange\
  \ of cultural values of different countries are a powerful tool for human development.\n\
  By helping the traveler, you help yourself. This practice of creating friendship\
  \ between two different cultures and exchanging information develops and broadens\
  \ the horizons of people. For me, as for the future architect, this gives a huge\
  \ advantage over their employers and competitors. This raises my level as a professional.\
  \ As my teachers say: \"You are not an architect, if you have not seen anything.\"\
  , and I agree with this.\nSeparately I would like to mention \"creative travelers\"\
  . These people are very fascinating and I will never refuse to sit on the \xABArbat\xBB\
  \ and draw together with the guest people, buildings, the rhythm of the city. At\
  \ such times, all boundaries between people are blurred, and you feel yourself on\
  \ the same wavelength with this person. It does not matter what you have different\
  \ cultures and languages. You are on the same wavelength. You feel this city. This\
  \ is the most invaluable experience - to sit down with your foreign friend, and\
  \ create something beautiful.\nMany people in the US, Canada, Australia and many\
  \ other countries know little about our country, and not every traveler here will\
  \ come. However, those travelers that come - fall in love with our culture and even\
  \ try to stay in Kazakhstan longer and get new friends. This is more than gratitude.\
  \ It's nice to know that people fall in love with the place where you live. And\
  \ the most pleasant thing in my business: I know that in another country I will\
  \ also be warmly greeted, fed and shown the city.\nOverall, thanks to this kind\
  \ of activity, I have got many good friends from such countries as Canada, USA,\
  \ Columbia, Japan, South Korea, Great Britain and many others. With all people,\
  \ I maintain a strong connection. We share news and call each other on a visit."
