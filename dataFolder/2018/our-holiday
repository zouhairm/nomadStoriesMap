Text: "I can barely see his face through the large-flaked snowfall. Jamie and I are\
  \ snowboarding in Soll, Austria and a storm has leered over our descent down the\
  \ slope. Back home, the small mountains I've snowboarded had posts to alert you\
  \ where the edge of the mountain was. Here in Austria, there are no warning signs.\
  \ We hold each other, arses in the snow, laughing. The dark humor we share shines\
  \ in this moment as we talk about how we might die. Falling off the edge? Frostbitten\
  \ frozen solid? Our goggles hit as we kiss and make a plastic dink that you could\
  \ barely hear over the gusts of icy wind. I take pictures with my disposable Kodak\
  \ camera and am instantly excited for their future development. Jamie guides me\
  \ down the mountain to safety, naturally, he is a British Armed Forces Paratrooper.\
  \ However, my snowboarding skills were not saved as I catch the edge of my board\
  \ and flop over into the snow somewhat gracefully but mostly awkward. He asks if\
  \ I'm alright in that charming British accent. And I am. \nLater that night we go\
  \ out to a bar that's shaped like a large keg laid on it's side. It's New Years\
  \ Eve. We drink beers in large mugs and dance. At the stroke of midnight confetti\
  \ falls from the ceiling and we all yell \"Happy New Year\"! Red-faced, sweaty and\
  \ smiling from ear-to-ear we kiss, the colorful little paper flakes stuck in our\
  \ hair and on our lips. We walk back to the hotel holding hands in the bitter cold\
  \ but it feels so good on our flushed skin. Our breath billows out from our mouths\
  \ into the dark night, the moon shining down on us approving of our night and our\
  \ love. \nWe take the train into Salzburg that morning, my parents travelled through\
  \ there in the early-80s. I have photos of my father on the pegasus in the dwarf\
  \ gardens. Now you are prohibited from touching them, guarded by chains. It's lightly\
  \ snowing and up on the hilltop Hohensalzburg Castle looks like a fairy tale. We\
  \ walk through the square and stop in a marzipan shop for my favorite sweet. I buy\
  \ a little pig-shaped candy and savor the perfect almond flavor. It is exquisite,\
  \ the candy and all the architectural wonder around me. So old and charming with\
  \ it's cobble stones and archways. I think about how I could live here and how gorgeous\
  \ it must be in the summer. Our holiday is nearly over and I will soon fly back\
  \ to the United States and he will go start his tour in Afghanistan. If I had known\
  \ I wouldn't see him again, I would have held his hand a little longer on our holiday\
  \ in Austria."
