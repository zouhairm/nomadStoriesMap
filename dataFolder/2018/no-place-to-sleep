Text: "My boyfriend and I had been driving around for a couple of hours. We were tired\
  \ and hungry, so we decided to find a place to sleep. Two days earlier we rented\
  \ a car to travel around in the Republic of Macedonia. It was a small part of our\
  \ trip through Eastern Europe. \n\nThe tourist agency\n\nAs we didn\u2019t have\
  \ a plan, we just followed some roads. We ended up at a small city, with flats and\
  \ houses with orange rooftops. The sign said \u0160tip. Before we\u2019d always\
  \ been able to find a place to sleep at the spot. This time it wasn\u2019t that\
  \ easy. We drove around and around, without seeing any signs of a hotel, hostel\
  \ or bed and breakfast. \n\nWhat we did find was a tourist agency. Inside sat a\
  \ young women with platinum blonde hair behind a desk. She must have seen within\
  \ a split second that we weren\u2019t locals and looked quite surprised. We asked\
  \ her if she knew a place were we could spend the night. The answer was negative.\
  \ \n\nThe boyfriend\n\nHer name was Simona. She\u2019d been living in \u0160tip\
  \ her whole life, worked at the tourist agency full-time but didn\u2019t make enough\
  \ money to travel herself. We told about our trip so far and all the things that\
  \ we planned to do. Suddenly she said: \u201CWait, I might know a place to sleep\
  \ for you\u201D. She picked up her phone, had a short conversation and hung up.\
  \ \u201CYou can both sleep at my boyfriend\u2019s place\u201D, she said.\n\nTen\
  \ minutes later the boyfriend walked in. He looked a bit goofy, had short dark brown\
  \ hair, small eyes and a friendly face. We tried to have a conversation. Although\
  \ it was more non-verbal, since he didn\u2019t speak English that well, my German\
  \ was lacking and our Macedonian skills were non-existing. \n\nThe party\n\nSimona\
  \ and Ace immediately invited us to a big party somewhere in the city. I didn\u2019\
  t have a clue what to wear, but since we were living out of a backpack I also didn\u2019\
  t really have much choice. I decided on a simple white t-shirt, shorts and sneakers.\
  \ When Simona arrived at Ace's place, I knew I would be totally underdressed. \n\
  \nI couldn't care less though. Here I found myself dancing in a city of which I'd\
  \ never heard of before, in a country that was unknown to me a week earlier. Only\
  \ because two people were so generous to share a part of their life with me, with\
  \ us. \n\nAn important lesson\n\nThe next day my boyfriend and I left a thank you\
  \ letter and drove away towards our next adventure. It was an experience to never\
  \ forget and I know now that no matter where you are, there will always be awesome\
  \ people who can be your friend."
