Text: "\u201CTu comprends?\u201D\n\nI nodded. I understood, sort of. He wanted me\
  \ to move my limbs in a wildly expressive yet contained and graceful way. His words\
  \ made sense, but whether I could mimic his movements was another matter entirely.\n\
  \nIt was my first full day in the tiny artists\u2019 village of Gu\xE9diawaye, and\
  \ I was feeling a bit disoriented. I had not really slept on the flights to Dakar,\
  \ and my first night upon arrival had not been particularly restful, either, partly\
  \ due to the unexpected, jarring blast of morning prayers, coupled with a lingering\
  \ cold and unbounded excitement about being halfway across the world for a week-long\
  \ intensive Afro-urban dance camp.\n\n\u201CComme \u04ABa?\u201D I asked, flailing\
  \ my arms about, positive I looked ridiculous despite having no studio mirrors around\
  \ to confirm my fears. Demba, our Sabar maestro, was doing an excellent job of not\
  \ laughing at any of us Americans, all of whom had some background in dance, but\
  \ little to no experience with this traditional West African style. He patiently\
  \ demonstrated the steps again, his agile body seeming to fly in perfect rhythm\
  \ with the drumbeats. But I simply could not make my fingers grace the sky or the\
  \ dust shake the way he did. I quietly darted off the sandy concrete platform toward\
  \ the frosty Atlantic Ocean to catch my breath and observe.\n\nFor a moment, I was\
  \ back in the first dance class I had ever taken as an adult, almost ten years ago.\
  \ A beginning hip hop class, where I struggled to catch on to the unfamiliar eight-count\
  \ while attempting to memorize choreography. Despite undoubtedly being the worst\
  \ one in the class, I fell into a fast, deep love. Over the years, I came to depend\
  \ on dance not only as good exercise, but also as my main creative outlet, my therapy,\
  \ and my community. Though I still did not consider myself a \u201Creal dancer,\u201D\
  \ what I lacked in talent, I made up for in passion and dedication.\n\n\u201CBakata,\
  \ bakata?\u201D Demba and the drums called me back. I rose from the sturdy rock-seat\
  \ I had found and made my way back. \u201CBadum-bai!\u201D I responded, along with\
  \ the others. \u201CBakata, bakata?\u201D I began rhythmically shifting my arms,\
  \ channeling the nearby waves, while gliding backward. \u201CBadum-bai!\u201D I\
  \ could not help it, a smile was forming. \u201CBakata, bakata!\u201D The words\
  \ were not French. Maybe they were Wolof, I did not know, as I could only recall\
  \ a few basic phrases. Maybe they were gibberish. But as my voice joined the chorus\
  \ of \u201CBadum-bai!\u201D I realized it did not matter. We were all speaking the\
  \ same language."
