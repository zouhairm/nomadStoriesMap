Text: "A cold December breeze was blowing into my face, making me shiver. Standing\
  \ on the promenade, staring onto the blue masses of the Yellow Sea, my thoughts\
  \ wandered off. I had arrived in Qingdao the previous day. Just two days earlier,\
  \ my travel buddy had unexpectedly taken a flight back home due to an injury. Left\
  \ alone, I was terrified. \nSuddenly, the sound of a female voice tore me out of\
  \ my thoughts and the spiral of nervous anxiety I was about to drift into once again.\
  \ I turned around. In front of me stood a slender Chinese woman in her late twenties.\
  \ She was carrying a large bag of groceries. Not sharing a common language, we both\
  \ made some unfruitful efforts for small-talk before we gave up and stood by the\
  \ shore in silence. \"I will keep going,\" I said after a while, underlying my words\
  \ with rudimental sign language attempts. The girl started walking in the direction\
  \ I had pointed at. I shrugged mentally and followed on her heels. \nOur language\
  \ barrier made conversation impossible but we both engaged in cheerful blabbering.\
  \ We shared our thoughts with each other, well aware that none of them would be\
  \ received.\nWith evening approaching, the temperatures started to drop. I rubbed\
  \ my hands. The girl reached into her bag and pulled out a pair of white-striped\
  \ blue gloves, handing me one and keeping the other. \nI started to wonder why she\
  \ was accompanying me. It was unlikely that she lived that far in my direction.\
  \ When I successfully hand-gestured my question, she pointed a finger at me then\
  \ made a circulatory movement with her open hand in front of her own face, before\
  \ splaying out the fingers, almost as forming claws, and contorting her face. Was\
  \ she implying that she had walked with me for close to two hours because she feared\
  \ I was going to be robbed due to my white face? I smiled at the thought. She was\
  \ more than one head smaller than I. Nevertheless, a wave of gratefulness came over\
  \ me. \nAfter another 15 minutes it was time to part. I thanked her, returning the\
  \ glove she had lent me. She smiled at me and waved goodbye before walking towards\
  \ a bus stop nearby. I stood motionless for a few seconds, bathing in the warmth\
  \ this encounter had brought to my heart. During my feared one-month solo trip,\
  \ I received so much kindness from both the Chinese people and expats that I was\
  \ truly overwhelmed and deeply humbled. And it all started with a single white-striped\
  \ blue glove supplying me with faith and permanently liberating me from all my nervous\
  \ anxiety."
