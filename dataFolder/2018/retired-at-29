Text: "I grew up in a village. Lush greens, fresh air and abundant scarcity of cars.\
  \ It's an hour of rough ride to the nearby town. Chicken cackles wake me up and\
  \ crickets lull me to sleep. No supermarkets, banks, drugstores and neighbors' hearty\
  \ laughter and loud chit chats is normal everyday happening. Everyone knows everyone.\
  \ I grew up playing mud, climbing trees and running under the rain.  Villagers plant\
  \ crops for a living or go to town to work as factory workers. Going to town to\
  \ see Mcdonalds makes a kid cool. Eating hamburger and bringing home toys was even\
  \ cooler. At 15, my parents tried the waves outside the Philippine shores. It left\
  \ me with two brothers to take care of. Education in Philippines is a luxury. We\
  \ must bear the distance. I became a single parent and grew more confused. Why am\
  \ I here? With a Bachelor's degree under my wings, I landed the corporate job of\
  \ my dreams. I belonged to Manila where everything cooler seemed to happen daily.\
  \ Skyscrapers, nice big shopping malls, cozy cafes, awesome nightlife and  busy\
  \ streets. I saw the woman I want to be when I was nine years old but I felt like\
  \ a headless chicken in a rat race. A job offer in Malaysia came. I started hanging\
  \ out with people who don\u2019t speak my language. I have heard beautiful stories\
  \ that tickled my imagination. I ate dishes I will not normally eat. Later on, I\
  \ craved for flavors I can\u2019t even put a name on. I have started hearing inaudible\
  \ voices in my head and felt the strong urge to listen to them and see for myself\
  \ but I always had the fear to start. I suddenly have new dreams and these dreams\
  \ can\u2019t wait. I explored Malaysia like a maniac that I can even walk around\
  \ it with my eyes closed.  Everything seemed cheaper allowing me to see more. Public\
  \ transportation was so good, I was always on the move. I almost saw the entire\
  \ continent. I felt unstoppable. Travel has taught me things I've never expected\
  \ I will learn but now I don't want to just travel. I want to learn about other\
  \ cultures. Even with my wimpy passport, nothing is impossible when something comes\
  \ from the heart. I am now polishing my German, volunteering as English teacher\
  \ to the Refugees and doing MBA program online. I put a teaching offer in Ecuador\
  \ on hold because I want to savor my newfound happiness. I am just a village girl\
  \ with out of this world dreams with high hopes that one day, I will be able to\
  \ write about how I threw myself out there and learned how to speak the universal\
  \ language called love."
