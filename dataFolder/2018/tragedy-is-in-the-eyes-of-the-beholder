Text: "I didn\u2019t know her name. I didn\u2019t know where she came from. I never\
  \ even saw the entirety of her face. All I ever knew about her were her eyes.\n\
  \ Escaping the oppressive barrier of her burqa, the detail of her eyes, which were\
  \ the rich color of a young tiger\u2019s stripes, swirled in the intensity of her\
  \ own private hurricane. One look was all she needed in order to yank me out of\
  \ my commonplace existence.\n Her eyes locked with mine for a prolonged moment as\
  \ we crossed paths on the swarming streets of Dhaka. With an ever-rising population\
  \ of 17 million, it was difficult to stand out in such an overcrowded metropolis\
  \ dominated by men, but that\u2019s what set her and I apart from the rest. In our\
  \ respective ways, we were outsiders.\n While the Muslim majority country gained\
  \ ground in the fight for equality, a standard doctrine on the role of women was\
  \ still king. With 25% of women married before the age of 15 and almost a third\
  \ believing that a man is justified in beating his spouse, it was no wonder that\
  \ her eyes revealed a story of untold fear.\n I was transfixed. I came to Bangladesh\
  \ because of a promise that I would find beauty in the people. She had the most\
  \ beautiful eyes I\u2019d ever seen, but she was ignorant to their splendor. To\
  \ her, the eyes were a symbol of tragedy.\n A wise man once taught me that \u201C\
  The tragedy of life is its tragedy.\u201D It took me years and most of what I understood\
  \ about the world to comprehend his meaning, but as soon as I crossed those eyes,\
  \ I knew.\n We\u2019re all victims of the same inevitable destiny, however the paths\
  \ we take to get there differ in many ways. Some become doctors and cure horrible\
  \ diseases while others bring guns to school with malice in their hearts. Some compose\
  \ symphonies that survive through the generations while others burn art deemed \u201C\
  provocative.\u201D\n And some are locked in an outdated way of life, destined to\
  \ suffer at the hands of an oppressor while others visit the same culture by their\
  \ own free will and leave having not been able to change a thing.\n Do caged elephants,\
  \ who know of no other life, acknowledge the shackles around their feet, and if\
  \ so, do they wish to break free?\n Are we meant to find any fulfillment between\
  \ here and the grave, or are we simply destined to, as William Blake wrote, \u201C\
  ...see a World in a Grain of Sand...\u201D? Having witnessed the reality, her tragedy\
  \ hit me like a hallucinogenic toxin as she vanished into an alley hidden behind\
  \ a pile of smoldering garbage, leaving me to write this silly story."
