Text: "The Russian government\u2019s decision to cut healthcare funding by a third\
  \ not only reduces the standard of medical care to that of a third world country,\
  \ but also raises red flags for Australian travellers.\n\nWhat the travel brochures\
  \ won\u2019t tell you, is that some hospitals are riddled with bribery, lack medical\
  \ supplies and specialists, and staff drink on the job \u2013 something I experienced\
  \ first-hand.\n\nOn the bumpy ambulance ride into the First Government Hospital\
  \ of Pyatigorsk for emergency appendicitis surgery, alarm bells were already ringing.\n\
  \nMy mother used to work at this hospital as a doctor 25 years ago and was shocked\
  \ that patients had to pay for basic care.\n\n\u201CThis isn\u2019t how things were\
  \ back then,\u201D she said. \u201CMedicine, food and other operations used to be\
  \ free.\u201D\n\nThe hospital essentially functions as a self-service facility,\
  \ which would be difficult for those travelling without family or friends to assist\
  \ them.\n\nThe food supplied by the hospital isn\u2019t personalised to a patient\u2019\
  s needs and has to be bought.\n\nIn terms of the accommodation, the regular rooms\
  \ have up to seven people in them. There are no windows, the floor tiles are broken,\
  \ the bedding is dirty and dust dances across every surface.\n\nYou have to make\
  \ it down the hall to one of the two bathrooms on every level, with only three toilets\
  \ per bathroom.\n\nIn terms of staffing, there are only two nurses on each level\
  \ of the hospital. This limited supervision is likely to be what led me to suffer\
  \ an inflamed vein where the drip had been held in my arm for eight days.\n\nRussia\
  \ has one of the highest alcohol consumption rates in the world with the average\
  \ person consuming 15.1 litres a year. So it\u2019s worrying, but perhaps not surprising,\
  \ that many medical staff and security guards drink on the job.\n\nOne nurse mentions\
  \ that her husband is unemployed and her son is disabled, so she asks for long hours;\
  \ yet the low pay still isn\u2019t enough to sustain her family.\n\nInevitably,\
  \ those long hours mean patients suffer too.\n\nAs this is the same nurse who, after\
  \ the operation, rolled me into my room, shakily picked me up, her breath smelling\
  \ of alcohol, and plonked me on the edge of the bed. The jolt made the room spin\
  \ around me.\n\nAfter leaving Pyatigorsk and its First Government Hospital, it emerged\
  \ that this was not an isolated experience.\n\nA government inspection of the hospital\
  \ has since been carried out and a meeting with the relevant Health Minister is\
  \ scheduled."
