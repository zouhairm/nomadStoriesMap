Text: "It sounded like the beginning of a bad joke; 29 dentists walk into a hostel\
  \ in Guatemala.\n The smells of dinner wafted in from the kitchen and I found myself\
  \ a chair at a table that looked friendly. Unknowingly, I had sat myself right in\
  \ the middle of a group dentists gathered from across the world to do volunteer\
  \ dental work in Santa Cruz, a small village atop a hill overlooking Lake Atitlan.\n\
  \ \u201CYou should come up and help out.\u201D\n\nThe next afternoon I wandered\
  \ up the hill curious to see what dental volunteer work in Guatemala looked like.\n\
  \ Their clinic was the local school\u2019s gymnasium. The walls were scuffed and\
  \ the yellow paint peeling. It was not the shiny, quiet, chrome-filled dental surgeries\
  \ I was used to. But it was clean, purposeful and busy. Drill bits whirred; Spanish,\
  \ English and Kaqchilel filled the air. \n I was seconded immediately. \u201CWe\u2019\
  re explaining how to use a toothbrush.\u201D\n \u201CIn Spanish?\u201D My Spanish\
  \ was only 3 weeks old.\n \u201CYep! It\u2019s time to practice!\u201D \n Courage\
  \ to use my new language came quickly when I saw the line of kids that needed help.\
  \ The work was hard and fast, and 3 hours later the line ended.\n\n\u201CJamie,\
  \ I need your help.\u201D It was my third afternoon helping and now Greg, a dentist,\
  \ was beckoning me over to his chair. \n As I changed my gloves my stomach clenched.\n\
  On the dental chair was a boy of ten clutching his own hands.\n I peeked over to\
  \ the dental notes and tried my best to keep my face neutral as I looked at the\
  \ list of work that he needed. Three fillings and an extraction.\n \u201CHola, Ricardo.\
  \ Mi nombre es Jamie,\u201D I told him and gave, what I hoped was, my most reassuring\
  \ smile.    \n I looked at Greg and waited for my instructions.\n \u201CI need you\
  \ to hold his hand.\u201D\n\nRicardo\u2019s eyes widened with every scrape. The\
  \ inside of his mouth was a bloodbath. The tooth that needed to be extracted was\
  \ stubborn and did not seem to want to come out. It broke as Greg pulled; Ricardo\
  \ shut his eyes tight. \n\u201CEsta bien, Ricardo,\u201D I murmured as I patted\
  \ his hair. \n\n\u201CFinished!\u201D \nMouth full of cotton-wool and gauze Ricardo\
  \ opened his eyes, smiled and squeezed my hand once more.\n\nUp the hill the next\
  \ day I stopped at the sound of my own name. A group of local boys were running\
  \ towards me. At the front of the group, with a slightly less toothy grin than yesterday,\
  \ was Ricardo.\n He stopped in front of me and opened his mouth. I ruffled his hair\
  \ affectionately. Then his friend told me he\u2019d brushed his teeth three times\
  \ yesterday. I couldn\u2019t help but smile."
