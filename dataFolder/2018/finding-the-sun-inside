Text: "Loose rocks crumbled under me as I kicked up the rust colored dirt with each\
  \ step I took. The Hawaiian sun beat down on my neck tauntingly while the cold water\
  \ in my canteen swished around with each jolting movement. Snow white clouds painted\
  \ themselves against the blue canvas of the Maui skies. A light breeze danced with\
  \ the air, guiding us to the top of the summit.\n\nI was on a morning hike, climbing\
  \ up shield volcano, also known as Mount Haleakal\u0101, which translated means\
  \ \u201Chouse of the sun\u201D. It\u2019s peak was 10,023 feet, and I was determined\
  \ to make it all the way to the highest allowed. In older times, legend had it that\
  \ the mountain was home to the grandmother of the demigod M\u0101ui. The grandmother\
  \ helped him capture the sun and using force, made it slow its journey across the\
  \ sky in order to make the days longer. \n\n\u201CI can't anymore.\u201D My girlfriend\
  \ sank herself down onto a flat boulder as she took a swig out of her canteen. \u201C\
  It\u2019s just too high, and I\u2019m starting to have trouble breathing. Go on,\
  \ I\u2019ll wait here.\u201D She was right, we were more than half up and the air\
  \ was getting colder. \n\nSomething was beckoning me to finish the climb and I was\
  \ eager to make it to the top. I had to complete the journey, even if it meant finishing\
  \ the trek alone. Besides, she would be fine on her own, I was the only one who\
  \ was having a spiritual connection with the mountain. \n\nHawaiians worship the\
  \ mountain, treating it like a temple and offering beautiful chants to the rising\
  \ sun. It gives them power and revitalizes them being in the home of the sun and\
  \ experiencing a spiritual awakening. I had never felt a pull towards anything in\
  \ my life. Never have I felt rooted to a ground and yet here, on the sacred mountain,\
  \ I felt as if the Hawaiian mountain, was levitating me to the top. I didn\u2019\
  t even notice the increased steepness. \n\nI was silent when I reached the summit,\
  \ the view leaving me in awe. A new sensation of calm had washed over my body like\
  \ gentle waves at a peaceful beach. My mind was clear, no lingering thoughts distracted\
  \ me and no worries penetrated me. All below me was an assortment of boulders, with\
  \ the sun shining down making the mountains own shadows throw a dark blanket over\
  \ the valley. \n\n\u201CNani.\u201D It was the only word I could think of to describe\
  \ the scenes. Out of the few Hawaiian words I knew, nani was one of them, it meant\
  \ beautiful. In those fleeting moments, I felt more connected to Mount Haleakal\u0101\
  \ than anywhere else and I had truly found myself, spiritually."
