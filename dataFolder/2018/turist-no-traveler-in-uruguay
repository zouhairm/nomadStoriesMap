Text: "I will tell you a short story, but I\u2019m sure, you won\u2019t believe it.\
  \ You might say, \u201Caw man, please be more credible!\u201D Because it\u2019s\
  \ like a fairytale. Maybe this is the moral: every fairytale was based on a true\
  \ story.\nSo once upon a time, I\u2019ve decided to get my backpack, and visit Cabo\
  \ Polonio... \nIt\u2019s a National Park near the ocean with no electricity and\
  \ you can\u2019t enter with a car so you have to leave the real world outside. I\
  \ immediately fell in love with the place. Not to mention that the sun finally came\
  \ out, so I laid down to enjoy the warmth and secretly dreamed about a cup of coffee.\
  \ After opening my eyes there\u2019s a guy next to me offering a cup of mate. It\u2019\
  s so unreal! I thought about a beverage and it happened. And the currier himself\
  \ was a divina\u2019. He is a nice engineer who reads to me in Hungarian, he is\
  \ interested in everything, so I am grateful for his company. Then I walk again,\
  \ for about six hours, and my back hurts but it\u2019s unbelievably nice to walk\
  \ by the ocean, toward the sunset. I can barely see anyone, so it\u2019s just me\
  \ and the universe all along. My engineer friend warns me about the nights here.\
  \ He says that it gets petty dark after the sun goes down. He even offers me to\
  \ stay at his place. I wonder around for a little while and then realize that he\
  \ was right. There is no light anywhere near, I can\u2019t see the moon, so when\
  \ I get back to the village I can\u2019t find anything. I don\u2019t have a place\
  \ to sleep, no money, and its freezing cold out there. I contemplate a little bit\
  \ where to go next and soon I find a beautiful restaurant full of candles and decide\
  \ to get inside for a cup of tea. A tea which should last about 4 hours. An Australian\
  \ singer\u2019s acoustic music, wonderful smells and my heard is melts in happiness.\
  \ When they are closing the place I get really bold and ask whether I could sleep\
  \ at this couch I am sitting in at the moment. The lady looks at me with amazement.\
  \ Nobody ever asked her this before. But she sits down, and we talk, she is trying\
  \ to figure out whether I am a serial killer or stuff like that. Eventually she\
  \ likes me and I have dinner with the stuff. Sitting in the half-light with all\
  \ the personnel, the singer and the amazing sheaf while they break the bread is\
  \ like a real communion. Thank you! It\u2019s the greatest night of my journey.\
  \ We keep talking till dawn and I fall asleep to the sound of the guitar. I wake\
  \ up and a surfer-looking guy with quite nice tattoos offers me some breakfast,\
  \ I get some toast with jam, but honestly was satisfied with the offer itself."
