Text: "A map on the bus looks like a whale, dives away, the harpoon of Florida. Drive\
  \ for six hours, to Trinidad, the belly. In Cienfuegos a billboard: Cuban soldier\
  \ punches Uncle Sam in face. Chinese man stares at us, talks with Russian girls,\
  \ \u201CAlways tell American from mile away,\u201D accent, spite, \u201CThey have\
  \ earphone.\u201D I turn mine down. Swelter. A Cuban looks at the military tat on\
  \ my leg.  \u201CDon\u2019t care of anything, but oil.\u201D Two American vets surrounded\
  \ by Communists.\nDays ago: Step off plane, backward in time, decades. Things we\
  \ know: 13 % fee for dollar into Cuban, credit/debit cards won\u2019t work, cash:\
  \ king. Make way to classic car. Fresh air. Race from suburbs to city, windows down,\
  \ Cuban music. Old facades, crowded streets, classics, soon the Plaza De La Revoluci\xF3\
  n, Jose Marti. At Bar Floridita, Hemingway\u2019s haunt. Our apartment, host isn't\
  \ there. Can\u2019t use phones, no service, wifi. \u201CAmerican?\u201D we nod,\
  \ heads turn, inquisitive.  Pitches: cigar, room, rum, girl? Milk for baby? \u201C\
  Americans, friends!\u201D Conversations turn to money. Morro Castle across the Port.\
  \ Exhaustion. Walk back, wait. Door opens, rush in. Tiny elevator, gracious mother\
  \ with two kids shows how to use. Sweat drips from us. Meet Carlos, \u201Cpassports,\
  \ I'\u2019ll keep safe.\" Our embassy, closed from attack. What happens if lost?\
  \ \"I\u2019ll keep mine.\" He talks of our president, \"crazy.\" The keys, still\
  \ in his hands.  My apologies, effusive. Bridge the divide. This, a diplomatic mission.\
  \ Outside, hands me a beer, keys: safety. Stroll Paseo de Prado. Radiant woman,\
  \ Cuban songs. Carlos, mojitos. Conner, cigarillos. Sit, imbibe Cuba, Hours, barhop,\
  \ drink, smoke. Carlos studied in Russia, married thrice. In his seventies, not\
  \ slowing. \"You are family now.\"  \nBack on the bus, Trinidad, labyrinth. Light\
  \ drains, high walls, cobblestone, incorrect maps. No road signs, house numbers.\
  \ Ask directions. No one knows. Concentric circles. Directions without destinations.\
  \ Options: dim. Blue door of Tony\u2019s house, a beacon. He\u2019s a musician,\
  \ travels, plays a local bar, tells us to eat in a century-old tree. The maze, get\
  \ lost, again. Finally, under Ceiba, mojitos, food, drums, guitars, crowing cocks,\
  \ a copy of Marti poetry. Tony, at 6am, says farewell. \nIn Havana, Americans in\
  \ Hemingway\u2019s room, mojitos. Something missing. Carlos. Tony. I wanted Cuba\
  \ on my list, countries, game hunted. Almost ended up in the belly, save our local\
  \ connections, whale riders, guides. Together we rode that breeching humpback, untamed\
  \ of the sea."
