Text: "Growing up in a competitive and fast-paced city like New Delhi, the pressure\
  \ to outperform and move forward in different spheres of life were the key ingredients\
  \ to success. Slowing down was never an option and was usually looked down upon\
  \ until one fine day I had to make an uncomfortable decision to quit my demanding\
  \ job that had adversely affected my physical and emotional health. The sheer thought\
  \ of ceasing down made me sweaty. For days my decision made me restless and uneasy\
  \ and that is when I embarked on a solo trip to Spain for two months. I chose a\
  \ country that stood as a contrast to my culture because I wanted to let go my inhibition\
  \ of pausing, learn to take care of my needs first and rejoice with a new perspective\
  \ to live my life. \n\nSpain, a storied country with a diverse culture and rich\
  \ history left me spellbound with its monuments, castles, palaces, natural landscapes\
  \ and majestic beauty that every city offered. In retrospect, I always get transported\
  \ to the white villages of Andalusia, orange trees in Seville, ancient city of Toledo\
  \ set up on a hill, bustling streets of La Latina with Tapas bars and beers, savor\
  \ Spanish style toast with tomato in a Madrid cafe and enjoy a beautiful evening\
  \ of Flamenco show. The relaxed lifestyle gave me a chance to experience the beauty\
  \ of slowing down. Spaniards have a way of enjoying life, just for the sake of enjoying.\
  \ Beyond the fiestas and siestas, I got charmed with their ability to fully relish\
  \ the present moment. They make time to go out for drinks in the middle of the week;\
  \ where normally there is hesitancy in going out in the middle of week, even just\
  \ for one drink, is that you will be too tired for work the next morning. I immersed\
  \ myself in the culture by learning Spanish language, meet and greet people from\
  \ different parts of the world and explore various hiking trails. Balance between\
  \ work and personal life is crucial and I owe my learning to this place and people.\
  \ In exploring and engaging with varied nationalities, I got exposed to multiple\
  \ perspectives of working my way through things and people. The enthusiasm to live\
  \ life was far more inspiring that led me to believe how worthy it is to live well\
  \ and not just make a living. \n\nI had a life-changing experience into a better\
  \ version of myself and the way I lived those two months became an ultimate eye-opener\
  \ in our short and complicated lives. Life is indeed a daring adventure or nothing\
  \ at all."
