  \n\u201CWhere are you going?\u201D\n\u201CDunno.\u201D\n\nI left 13 years ago.\n\
  Borrowed a car from my parents with the loose promise of returning it someday. Caught\
  \ the ferry to the mainland, determined to drive around every Australian capital\
  \ city before eventually leaving for Europe.\n\nOf course, fate intervened and I\
  \ ended up as far as Adelaide, where I quickly found myself in a relationship and\
  \ never moved onwards.  As long as it wasn\u2019t Tasmania, I was happy. Adelaide\
  \ had non- gravel beaches with water that wouldn\u2019t numb your body to a point\
  \ of near non-revival. Adelaide had vintage stores, and people who wore vintage\
  \ store purchases without judgement. Adelaide wasn\u2019t left off of the tour schedule\
  \ of every big band that came through.\n\nTime moved on, as time does. I travelled.\
  \ I went back to University. I worked in Germany, and most importantly, I refused\
  \ to spend longer than two weeks at a time in Tasmania, despite my whole family\
  \ being there.\nTasmania?  Too Cold.  Too uncultured. Too backwards.\n\nMy partner\
  \ and I moved to London, as the final rite of passage before our presumed marriage.\n\
  My partner and I broke up in London, two weeks before our visas ended and we would\
  \ be brutally expelled from the country. We stood on a bridge in the rain, as if\
  \ acting out a terrible movie scene.\n\u201CWhere will you go?\u201D he asked, with\
  \ a touch of sincerity.\n\u201CWell, I can\u2019t go back to Adelaide, can I?\u201D\
  \n\u201CAdelaide is plenty big enough for both of us.\u201D\n\u201CNo. I\u2019m\
  \ done! I\u2019m\u2026\u201D the words choked on my lips, \u201CMoving home!\u201D\
  \n\nIt was the last thing I expected, and it took almost a week to notice. That\
  \ while I had been busy experiencing life, changing my appearance and adapting,\
  \ so had Tasmania. She\u2019d thrown off her cloak of insecurity and blossomed.\
  \ I could not longer liken a visit to Tasmania with staying on a remote farm.\n\n\
  We had music festivals. We had free street parties with international acts. We had\
  \ class. We also suddenly had world quality craft beer and craft beer establishments\
  \ just as good as anywhere else in the world. How had this happened?\n\nA quarter\
  \ of the year was dragon-breath cold, yet we somehow ranked 3rd on the list of most\
  \ livable cities in Australia.\nThe \u2018mainlanders\u2019 who once laughed at\
  \ us for supposedly having two heads, were flocking to be here.\nI felt honoured\
  \ to be a native. Amid the freshest air in the world, the best gin in Australia\
  \ and some of the nicest people I\u2019d ever met.\nTasmania was home. \nI was home."
