Text: "With no idea what to expect, we nervously loaded onto the fur-lined carriage.\
  \ Our driver was dressed in traditional Sami clothing. Thick fur-lined boots, a\
  \ bright blue tunic nearly down to his knees, and a large blue hat. He was a man\
  \ of few words, and the group matched his disposition.  \n\nI pulled a loose fur\
  \ blanket up to my chin, not so much from the cold, but my apprehension. On a whim\
  \ I had flown across the world to live in Finland for a year. No connections, no\
  \ family, no friends. Next to me in this horse-drawn carriage, my compatriots kept\
  \ to themselves and giggled in their native language.  \n\nOur driver snapped the\
  \ reigns and the horses began to pull us across the frozen lake. As we drifted further\
  \ away from the lights of the cabin, it seemed as though we were crossing into another\
  \ dimension. The brisk air made clouds out of our breath. The sky was painted so\
  \ dark, it felt almost indigo above us.   \n\nI was gripped with a sudden fear.\
  \ What was I getting myself into? In all of my adventures I had never actually met\
  \ a shaman. Would she really be able to see into my future? There is a certain bravery\
  \ that comes with having a mirror held up to your soul, and in that moment, I wasn't\
  \ entirely sure that I had it. \n\nIn the distance, we could see a fire crackling.\
  \ That was our destination. Our mysterious emissary pointed forwards. Through squinting\
  \ eyes, I could make out a large tent, not unlike the native teepees in my homeland.\
  \   \n\nWe arrived to a small group of travelers and another man dressed the same\
  \ as our driver. He welcomed us and drew us close to the fire. Each of us received\
  \ a cup of hot gl\xF6gi, a traditional hot berry drink, with a stone dropped inside.\
  \ He explained in his thick Laplander accent that the Sami believe we are all connected\
  \ to the earth in everything that we do, and the stone is a reminder of that.  \
  \ \n\nWe began to sip the sweet drinks and chat around the fire. Our backs were\
  \ all turned to the tent, not wanting to recognize that someone waited inside for\
  \ us. The Sami man who had handed us the drinks spoke up. \n\n\"You will go in one\
  \ at a time. Who is first?\" \n\nMy compatriots shook their heads. Everyone at the\
  \ fire stood very still in fear of being called upon. I looked around. My toes felt\
  \ fuzzy from the gl\xF6gi.I gulped back my drink and pocketed the stone. It was\
  \ time to face my truth.  \n\n\"I'll go.\" \n\nHe smiled and motioned to the tent.\
  \ I took a deep breath, pushed back the leather flap, and stepped inside."
