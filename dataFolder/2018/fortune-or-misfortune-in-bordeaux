Text: "Our relationship was shooting for its end, but there were some days left before\
  \ his return to Canada, and mine to Russia. Now, on the mid-August afternoon we\
  \ were driving from Biarritz to Bordeax, urging to the fast-speed train that would\
  \ take us to Paris, when unforeseen things started to happen. First, the rental\
  \ office declared to be closed. Circling for the umpteenth time to find the new\
  \ address, we postponed the train till tomorrow and decided to spend the night in\
  \ Bordeaux. The absence of any vacant hotel room on booking services made me doubting,\
  \ him - not. He was sure to find a room by asking at each hotel, which we did and\
  \ soon came to a deal: \xABIf he finds a room \u2013 I pay for it\xBB. I don`t remember\
  \ what would happen in the event of not finding the room \u2013 the thing last expected\
  \ by us both\u2026 At midnight we had to leave the Pakistani restaurant, where we\
  \ googled like maniacs for options as far as 15 km away from Bordeaux. None. My\
  \ boyfriend \u2013 a brave bearded man told me that we could sleep in the car. When\
  \ you are suddenly homeless you start looking in the faces of passers-by, envying\
  \ them for their beds they will be in tonight. You even find the display of beds\
  \ in furniture stores to be inhuman. \nWe almost fell asleep in the car, but presence\
  \ of other - real homeless people - nearby made us wanna drive from Bordeaux in\
  \ the farmland, where my friend invited me to go out, wrap up in layers and follow\
  \ him. In the silence broken by my stepping on the crispy plants we found a hill\
  \ and lay down. We were surrounded by darkness and the shiny dome of the sky, where\
  \ shooting starts - as miracle or reality - crossed the sky.  - Hey, have you seen\
  \ it? - No. What? Bryan, I see it now. - Where? - Oh, another one. Then, he kept\
  \ silent. Being left on my own and hugging the ground with my shoulder blades, I\
  \ thought a single thought. Beyond the regrets that soon we will part - one wondering:\
  \ Why have I slept all nights in my life under the roof? \nIn the morning we tried\
  \ to find a reason behind the strange events of last night. We thought that the\
  \ fully-booked Bordeaux was a sign that something tried to protect us from the possible\
  \ accident on the train. It was a sufficient explanation as I drank coffee, he read\
  \ the news, and the Atlantic salt still stayed on our skin. \xABThe peak of the\
  \ Perseid meteor shower is this weekend, and tonight and Saturday night are the\
  \ best times to watch. Observers can expect to see at least 80 meteors an hour streak\
  \ across the sky\xBB. \nAha..."
