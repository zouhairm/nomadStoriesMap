Text: "He reached behind and pulled me tightly into him so that we were one.  I was\
  \ ready.  He kicked his feet off the ground and we descended down the jungle gorge.\
  \ \u201CI\u2019m sorry mom!\u201D, I yelled in my head as our wheels crested the\
  \ edge and passed the point of no return.\_ My helmet was too large\_and it was\
  \ bouncing around my face, but I was thankful for it. \n\nThirty minutes earlier,\
  \ I had been taking a moment to gather my bearings along the backroads of Nusa Penida.\_\
  \ I looked across and saw a dog ride up next to me on a scooter.\_ He looked nonchalant\
  \ and slowly took a lick of his lips, as dogs do when they are unimpressed.  \u201C\
  Hi,\u201D I said with a glow, being in a blissful state of mind.\_ \u201CHello,\u201D\
  \ he said back.\_ \u201CYou know where you go?\u201D, the dog\u2019s human asked.\_\
  \ He had the face of an old-time storybook, filled with deep lines and weathered\
  \ pages, his brow was furled with curious inquisition. \_ I wanted to tell him I\
  \ was just wandering and didn\u2019t care where I went, but I didn\u2019t want him\
  \ to leave me either.\_ I asked to take a photo, and they both obliged kindly, their\
  \ expressions frozen in a bland gaze.\_ I didn\u2019t know it then, but just hours\
  \ away, I would be snapping selfies of us frolicking in the waves with sandy hair\
  \ and laughing eyes. \_\L\n\nWhen our bike reached the bottom of the lush crevasse,\
  \ he reached out his hand to me, and I placed my hand gently inside of it.\_ Without\
  \ a word, he clasped his fingers over mine and began down the path\u2014I knew that\
  \ I had I found what I came for.  As I discovered during those precious hours with\
  \ my dog-man, you can\u2019t purchase the holding of a hand down a thousand steps;\
  \ you can\u2019t book someone online who gives you the shoes off his feet so that\
  \ you are more steady on the path; there\u2019s no Yelp review for playing in the\
  \ waves with someone who can\u2019t swim but who wants to see you laugh, and in\
  \ turn breaks a smile of his own.  I was thankful that we could not communicate\
  \ with words.\_ Without them, you become in tune with the subtleties of a touch,\
  \ a glance, a heartbeat.\_ \n\n\L\u201CFor you,\u201D\_ he said as we stood watching\
  \ the crashing waves below.  He opened his palm, and from it shone a circle of ivory\
  \ gypsum set in silver.  I put my hands over my heart, then took his in mine and\
  \ lifted them to my forehead in gratitude.  I keep it as a reminder of the human\
  \ connection that is possible when you let go of control and follow the Sirens that\
  \ beckon you. \n\nAs I left Bali, the text read: \u201CI love you, Shelly\u201D\
  , but I already knew."
