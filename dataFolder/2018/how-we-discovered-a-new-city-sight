Text: "\u2013 You are the first person I bring there. No one of my tourists or couchsurfers\
  \ have seen that place. So you should estimate it and say is it really worth to\
  \ be visited.\nMe and my Couchsurfing host were going to the Western part of Kermanshah,\
  \ where Sunni Kurds live. \n\u2013 Can I take photos of them? \u2013 I asked.\n\u2013\
  \ I don't know. I even have no idea how will they react to a foreigner.\n\nThat\
  \ was the thing I worried about the most. I really wanted to bring some pictures\
  \ from that place. \n\nKurds constitute the majority of the city population. But\
  \ unlike most of their compatriots Kermanshah Kurds profess not Sunni but Shia Islam.\
  \ Many of them even identify themselves not as Kurds by their ethnicity but as Iranians\
  \ by their citizenship. Maybe because of this in the downtown it\u2019s hard to\
  \ meet a person in a Kurdish national suite.\n\nSo plenty of men dressed in Kurdish\
  \ wide leg trousers meant we were close to the final destination. The neighborhood\
  \ itself was looking poor enough. A few years before the government built here a\
  \ residential complex with cheap flats, and now these neat grey houses look like\
  \ an urbanism masterpiece against the rest of the district. But actually, this place\
  \ wasn't much dirtier than the downtown.\n\nThe local market starts from trashy\
  \ sheds under which second-hand clothes were for sale. Next bazaar rows were much\
  \ tidier. Generally poor but clean. Five minutes after we entered the bazaar sellers\
  \ spotted us and my host started to talk with them. Eventually, as it often happens\
  \ in Iran, we became a kind of local celebrities. So all people from around came\
  \ to gape at us.\n\n\u2013 Ukraine? You Ukraine? \u2013 an excited vendor was trying\
  \ to explain me in bad English. \u2013 My two brother Europe too! Denmark!\nI decided\
  \ not to upset him telling that Denmark isn\u2019t much further from Ukraine than\
  \ Iran. Both geographically and civilizationally.\n\nAs we were going along I found\
  \ out I shouldn\u2019t worry about taking photos. Local sellers absolutely were\
  \ not against it. Moreover, they were asking to shoot them and were unbelievably\
  \ happy to see their faces on my camera display.\n\u2013 Photo he! And he! And he!\
  \ \u2013 a tradesman run into his colleague\u2019s tent and nearly by force took\
  \ him to me. \u2013 And photo us two.\nThe only place where I have seen friendlier\
  \ locals is Dharavi slums in Mumbai.\n\nAt the end I got almost a full catalog of\
  \ stores and sellers. After we left the bazaar a crowd of local boys was following\
  \ us, pointing their fingers and shouting in Farsi: \u201CForeigner! Foreigner!\u201D"
