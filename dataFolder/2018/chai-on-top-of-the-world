Text: "The air in the Himalayas is almost too breathable, and the sun throws luster\
  \ off the snow-roofed peaks. It\u2019s surprisingly green. On that day there was\
  \ just navy sky stretching for miles like an ocean underneath the summits. The mountains\
  \ are easy to appreciate, but even easier to overlook because of how terrifying\
  \ it is to pilot through them. Our driver was doing an okay job, but every so often\
  \ I\u2019d feel a tire skirt the edge of the unguarded drops. It seemed unavoidable\u2013\
  the Zoji La Pass was second-highest pass in the world. This exploit was defying\
  \ a fine line between exhilarating and complete disregard for safety.\n\nWe were\
  \ trailing a Toyota with schoolboys spilling over the edges, singing loudly in Bhoti.\
  \ I lifted my camera to the windshield and they exploded in energy, waving, sticking\
  \ out tongues. People here were friendly. Despite living in an area burdened with\
  \ invasions and disputes, they seemed, ironically, above it all. My driver had informed\
  \ me that while most Ladakhis live poorly, their homes are self-supporting and always\
  \ open to everyone. I assumed part of the Ladakhi Zen had to do with the majority\
  \ Tibetan monks that had molded the landscape with Buddhist monasteries called gompas,\
  \ dressed in bellowing stupas, labyrinths of prayer flags, and frescos. \n\nIn fact,\
  \ we were on our way to one right now. Diskit Gompa is the  largest monastery in\
  \ this part of the Nubra, and we were supposed to arrive in a few hours. Well, a\
  \ few minutes past a few hours, at least - looks like the road trip caffeine fix\
  \ is pretty much universal. \n\nThis chai vendor smiled, most of his teeth missing,\
  \ and offered me candy. I don\u2019t know why it was so amusing to see a Twix Bar\
  \ in this part of the world, but I was glad I was here and said thank you in Hindi.\
  \ \u201CWhere you from?\u201D He asked, obvious that Hindi was his 2nd language.\
  \ It was mine too.\n\n\u201CThe US.\u201D I replied. \u201CHave you been?\u201D\n\
  \n\u201CLadakh is my home. Why would I ever need to leave?\u201D He said, like it\
  \ was apparent. I looked around. His shop was simple. In the back, two kids played\
  \ with an abacus below stairs that led to a second floor\u2013most likely where\
  \ they all lived as a family. From where I was standing, they had probably one of\
  \ the most regal views in the world, and I found myself unable to argue. \n\n\u201C\
  I think a lot of people back home want this sort of life, but they\u2019re scared\
  \ to give up certain things.\u201D I said. I handed him a few rupees and left him,\
  \ knowing that he\u2019d never understand how hard it was to get here."
