Text: "In the spring of 2017, I left the United States midway through spring semester\
  \ to head back home to Bhutan. I needed to relax and de-stress. But before returning\
  \ home for the first time in years, I stopped in sunny warm Singapore - the opposite\
  \ of the cold Northeast of the US. Stark contrasts in weather and my disposition.\
  \ There, I went to the beach for the first time in my life. There, I saw the most\
  \ beautiful thing I've ever seen - the Singapore river by Clark Quay in the evening,\
  \ listening to street singers, sipping wine with special people. There was a girl.\
  \ \n\nI've known this girl since I was 15. She was the first girl I ever loved.\
  \ For two years, she was the stuff of my dreams, the name that made a high school\
  \ teenage boy blush in front of his friends. We never dated. The timing always seemed\
  \ off (for her). But she promised me she loved me too. And after two years of hoping\
  \ she'd be with me, I just stopped being in her life. I never said goodbye. I'd\
  \ promised her, dramatically one day as she called and said sorry for not being\
  \ with me, that I'd never say goodbye to her, that I'd always love her, and so many\
  \ more things. You know how these teenage love stories go. \n\nA year after we stopped\
  \ being in each other's lives, we met, by chance. I'd just done a standup routine\
  \ at a bar, and she was in attendance. We spent much of the night drinking whiskey\
  \ and talking. Over the next few weeks, we remembered why we loved each other. But\
  \ even then, we didn't date. That year we ended up on opposite sides of the world,\
  \ her in Singapura and I in the US. That was also the year she told me she regretted\
  \ not having dated me when she had the chance. She said that again and again over\
  \ the next few years. But each time she said it, she'd disappear for months. Around\
  \ the 4th time, I stopped believing her. \n\nSo, when I landed in Singapore and\
  \ went to meet her, I didn't know if I still loved her. This was the girl I'd promised\
  \ to love forever. The girl I'd promised I'd never say goodbye to. I realized I\
  \ did still love her, but in a different way now. But I needed to say goodbye to\
  \ her. So I still remember that we had whiskey at a speakeasy, ate burgers at a\
  \ little joint, and she gave me an e.e.cummings poem as she left the night I decided\
  \ would be the last time I'd ever see her for the rest of my life. \n\nThe cold\
  \ of the US northeast need not follow me warm Singapore. And ghosts of my old loves\
  \ need not haunt me now."
