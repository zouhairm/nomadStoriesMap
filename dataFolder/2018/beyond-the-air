Text: "Beyond The Air\n\nWe did road trips for any event or activity. So one Friday\
  \ we drove 6 hours from Toronto to Foresters Falls to camp at Wilderness Tours for\
  \ Whitewater Rafting on the Ottawa River.  \n\nWe pitched tents in cold summer rain,\
  \ but the Sun God smiled on us for Saturday's rafting, as we awoke to glorious sunshine\
  \ and the sound of birds.  You know, the kind of day seen in Disney movies, that\
  \ makes you want to whistle.  \n\nI was battling kamikaze butterflies (suited the\
  \ day) dive bombing the pit of my stomach as I thought about navigating rapids.\
  \ Yes, I was along for the ride, but trepidation was riding with me. \n \nIt worsened\
  \ when the Bungee Jumping Adventure was mentioned, and I saw the extremely high\
  \ jump tower. \n\nRafting was scenic, exhilarating and sometimes-scary fun, especially\
  \ when our guides skillfully surfed our raft on the waves.  \n\nIn addition to sun\
  \ and fun, I got a cold, complete with a stuffy head. I fell asleep miserable, and\
  \ undecided about the bungee experience. Honestly, I anguished over it even up to\
  \ the moment I tossed myself off the tower that overcast Sunday.  \n\nSomehow I\u2019\
  d decided to embrace my University\u2019s motto:  Tentanda via (The way must be\
  \ tried). And this was one more way, like riding higher and scarier rollercoasters,\
  \ to reduce my fear. \n\nMy decision took me to the edge of a crane, 150 feet above\
  \ a river, with essentially a giant elastic band tied around my ankles.\n\nI told\
  \ myself to look out, not down, as I slowly, climbed what seemed like endless rungs\
  \ up the tower. I felt no butterflies that day; likely due to my mind\u2019s pre-occupation\
  \ with death scenarios.  I heard shouted encouragement as I shuffled up to the gents\
  \ for harnessing. I begged them to please push me, but that was against policy.\
  \    \n\nPride rejected climbing back down (proving it does go before a fall), so\
  \ I said a prayer for my greatest leap of faith. I gaped at the amazing view of\
  \ sky, land, and water before flopping (no graceful dive) into air. \n\nMy drop\
  \ was so fast I barely screamed before feeling a gentle tug yanking me up and away\
  \ from the water I\u2019d been plunging towards. \n\nMy transition from falling\
  \ to effortlessly soaring was surreal, and all I could only laugh. I thought this\
  \ must be what birds feel when flying. Then reality returned, as I struggled to\
  \ breathe while hanging upside down with blocked sinuses, awaiting the boat. \n\n\
  Recalling that moment still brings a blissful calm, and reminds me that being on\
  \ the edge can produce great experiences."
