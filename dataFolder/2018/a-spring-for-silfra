Text: "Freezing liquid starts seeping in by my wrists and with every movement more\
  \ pours in. My arms start going numb from the elbow down. However, the coolness\
  \ doesn\u2019t bother me. How could it possibly bother me when the view is this\
  \ extra-terrestrial?\nI\u2019m floating amongst the clouds in this new universe.\
  \ Under me is tens and tens of meters of clear, turquoise water. Big, sharp rocks\
  \ burst out from the sides, pushing in \u2013 or more accurately \u2013 being pulled\
  \ apart. I am hoovering in the exact middle between Europe and America. The two\
  \ continental plates pull away, and I am in no man\u2019s land. Cold and wet, guided\
  \ through the Silfra crack by the calm stream of melted glacier. I can see as far\
  \ as in air, only that this gives everything a shimmering turquoise tint, a magic\
  \ film of colour. Small green fingers wave to me as I pass; how any seaweed can\
  \ manage to grow here is beyond my comprehension. I breathe in through the snorkel\
  \ and dive down, the suit filling up with more water but I don\u2019t care, I have\
  \ to feel at one with this world right here. I need to immerse myself in it.\nSoon\
  \ the distant dark blue bottom comes closer, and we turn in to a lake of still water\
  \ with light soft sand stretching out beneath us. \nWe leave the lake; I take the\
  \ googles of and immediately get hit in the face by the cold wind. Iceland is smiling\
  \ at me and I smile right back. The green mountains and dark hills surround us and\
  \ the large field of thick, green moss. The colours are surreal. Even though the\
  \ only sound that exists is the wind and the water and my friends splashing as they\u2019\
  re making their way out of it, I hear a song. Nature is singing for us.\nSlowly,\
  \ we make our way back. Cold, relaxed, sad that it\u2019s over but blissful to have\
  \ experienced it.\n\u201CWait\u201D, the guide says, and we step off of the path\
  \ and make our way up to a cliff. Ten metres below a 90 degree drop is another small\
  \ lake with the same cold and completely clear water. Even though the bottom is\
  \ far below the surface, we can see every detail of it. \n\u201CWho wants to jump\
  \ in?\u201D\n\u201CMe.\u201D \nMaybe it\u2019s my cold brain speaking or the daring\
  \ nature surrounding us, but there\u2019s no going back now. My heart starts pounding,\
  \ rushing with adrenaline and blood. I step up to the ledge, my toes over the edge.\
  \ I look down. The surface seems even more distant from here and the sharp rocks\
  \ beneath it way too close.\nI take a last breath of the fresh Icelandic air and\
  \ close my eyes, beg for luck. My body does not longer feel as freezing as before.\n\
  And I jump."
