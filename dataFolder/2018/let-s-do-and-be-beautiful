Text: "... you don't know how to connect with people, you're a poor listener, you\
  \ don't know what falling in love feels like, you're incapable of this, you're undeserving\
  \ of that.. & then Egypt 2017 happened! I was at a point in time of my life where\
  \ I was pouring with self-doubt and self-pity. There was absolutely no reason for\
  \ me to be so unhappy, unhappy with my own self. I was interning at my dream workplace\
  \ with the best people around & under the mentor who inspired me to bits. Still,\
  \ I felt like a failure every single day. I knew something was definitely wrong\
  \ with me.\nI decided to give myself a break. the next you know is.. I'm in Egypt\
  \ with around 40 wonderfully amazing people from 20 beautiful parts of the world,\
  \ spending the best 47 days of summer. When I landed in the wondrous land of the\
  \ Pharaohs I had absolutely no plan in mind, no clue of what was going to come ahead,\
  \ no expectations, nothing at all and I feel that was the BEST PLAN EVER. I don't\
  \ think I've ever been so true to myself, true about my emotions, my feelings, my\
  \ flaws, my shortcomings, my fears, all thanks to the plan of not having a plan.\
  \ \nCountless is the word for the number of memories that  helped me realize who\
  \ I am, how does it feel to connect to the heart of a person, what it means to become\
  \ the best thing that could happen to a person's summer, someone's guiding angel,\
  \ to bid farewells crying out with tears of joy & to give and receive abundant and\
  \ unbound love.\nTo narrate one, allow me to introduce you to Tefs, a person whose\
  \ each & every body cell is made up of simple pure love. You know how they say that\
  \ the goodness in someone else helps bring out the best in you. I think it was the\
  \ warmth and love of the people around me that helped me realize the infinite love\
  \ I'm capable of sharing as an individual.\nTefs at that point in time wasn't going\
  \ through the best phase of his life & it just broke my heart to see him shatter\
  \ & fall apart cause of a heartbreak. He poured his heart out to me telling me how\
  \ he couldn't get that one thing he desired for all those years. All I did was,\
  \ listen.\n\nEver since he calls me his guiding angel who brought her out of the\
  \ dark. \nEver since I've learnt to love myself a little too much & fall in love\
  \ with the beauty of souls and the little things that surround me.\nEver since I\
  \ embrace my quirks a little too much, carry my failures with pride with the desire\
  \ to wake up the next day as a better version of myself.\n\nThank you 2017 for being\
  \ a darling!"
