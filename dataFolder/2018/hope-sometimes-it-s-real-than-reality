Text: "Some stories are better left untold, but not this one! \n\nWhen the universe\
  \ wants two people to meet, they will meet, against all the odds. \n\nA lady- corn\
  \ vendor on Armbol beach- 3 kids- two girls and a boy, one alcoholic unemployed\
  \ husband.\n\nEvery day, she brings her kids to the beach after the school so none\
  \ of them stays with abusive drunkard father.\n\nKids play on the beach, roam around,\
  \ talk to people and enjoy the time on the beach. \nMisfortunate, but still happy.\
  \ \n\nA couple- who has all the luxuries they can afford with their earnings. Middle\
  \ class with inherited money. 20 years of marriage and no kids.\n\nFortunate, but\
  \ with an empty space in their hearts. \nFor last 2 years, they have been coming\
  \ to the beach every weekend to meet Sudha, the little girl in the pic. You can\
  \ call its Sudha\u2019s luck, or god heard couple\u2019s prayers, or good fortune\
  \ of both. Because now, Sudha is getting adopted by the couple which is under progress.\
  \ \n\nTo keep the real bond remains intact, every weekend, they bring Sudha to meet\
  \ her biological mother and siblings so she can\u2019t forget who the real ones\
  \ are and who the new ones in her life are. \nUniverse must be so happy to see the\
  \ little girl smiling, as all worked out as planned. \n\nBut, the prettiest part\
  \ about the whole story is- now the name \u2018Sudha\u2019 is for her real family,\
  \ but new family calls her \u2018Asha\u2019, in English it stands for \u2018hope\u2019\
  \ and she started responding for the name as well"
