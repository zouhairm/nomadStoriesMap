Text: "It wasn\u2019t the blazing sun that had gotten me hot headed, just the agonising\
  \ fact that my leaves had been rejected while someone else\u2019s granted, again.\
  \ It was frustrating to know that sister\u2019s anniversary is a valid reason while\
  \ a bike trip isn\u2019t, yet again!\nSitting at my work desk now I was in the place\
  \ the eye doesn\u2019t see, it\u2019d been 2 years slogging hard yet I couldn\u2019\
  t convey my dream to the bunch of bankers I was working with. Supposed to mail the\
  \ reports soon I kept hitting the keypad hard, not thinking much. Sometimes your\
  \ whole life boils down to one insane move and thus I pressed the Send button; my\
  \ Resignation letter was in the outbox now.\nSix weeks hence it didn\u2019t seem\
  \ as easy, I had been rejected by a few Bike clubs for the Delhi-Ladakh Bike trip\
  \ on the grounds of no past riding experience. It was 15th August, the Independence\
  \ Day ride and it was raining as I told one of them what it means to me, my last\
  \ shot at it, I\u2019d be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t expecting a No but what\
  \ I got told sent me packing for the trip the very same night- \u201CYou would not\
  \ be able to do it.\u201D\nI didn\u2019t carry much, just my backpack and me atop\
  \ our Cruiser through the carpeted highways of Punjab, to the homestay in Shimla,\
  \ to the shade of Pines in Kullu, to the smell of Marijuana in Kasol, through the\
  \ trek to Malana, and then past Rohtang pass via the roadside coffee in Koksar,\
  \ the ginger tea in Jispa, and the impish smiles of Sarchu I finally got Leh\u2019\
  d, with a broken brake pedal, dismantled Side box, a serviced Zeal and an infinite\
  \ Zest.\nThen on to Siachen, via the Nubra valley, past the army men and their arduous\
  \ life wherein I met a Colonel (read Uncle) who made sure I stayed with the Army\
  \ in Kargil and Srinagar. There on riding at dawn to go past curfews and pelting\
  \ stones to the Golden Temple to be eclipsed by divinity, and let the silent screams\
  \ be taken over by the loud silence. I geared up for the last ride home on a day\
  \ it rained incessantly from dawn to dusk yet I pushed myself back home past 5 states\
  \ & 4100 kms to have that tea made by mom, pondering over\n\nThe Juggernaut that\
  \ swivelled, almost kissing me, pushing me off the bridge\nYet I made it pass\xE9\
  , breath-taken as I approached the gorgeous Himalayan valley past the ridge,\nThree\
  \ weeks of riding hence, I begged my own self to be taken back atop a sledge,\n\
  Once back & no job in sight, bills at hand towering over the wallet's height, with\
  \ the pot of tea between my palms thinking of a decision that pushed me to the edge."
