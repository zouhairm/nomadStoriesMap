Text: "\"Excuse me, sir! You\u2019ve dropped your brush!\" \n\nMy husband hailed on\
  \ the street a man, who was walking ten steps in front of us. The man was dressed\
  \ up in dark inconspicuous clothes and carried a basket full of different brushes\
  \ and boxes in his hands. Apparently, he was a shoe cleaner.\n\n\"Oh, thank you!\"\
  \ he replied with heavy Turkish accent and smiled. He went back to pick up his lost\
  \ brush. I noticed a droplet of sweat falling from his forehead. It was a rather\
  \ hot day on the waterfront near the Marmara Sea at Istanbul and we got \u201Cwonderfully\
  \ lost\u201D just wandering through the streets.\n\n\"Come here, I\u2019ll clean\
  \ you shoes,\" the man said suddenly. \n\"Well, there\u2019s no need in cleaning,\
  \ but thank you,\" my husband replied politely. Still that was too late. The shoe\
  \ cleaner deftly took out a small stool from his basket and quickly greased one\
  \ of his brushes with some kind of black paste. Than we spent ten awkward minutes\
  \ while our new acquaintance was cleaning my husband\u2019s shoes. \n\nAttempts\
  \ to make a conversation faded as soon as they begun. I started to feel a small\
  \ pang of regret that we let this man hold us down on this heated quay. Finally,\
  \ he was done with brushing. \n\n\"That would be 80 lira,\" the shoe cleaner stunned\
  \ us. That was a cost of a good lunch for two at Istanbul. \n\n\"Excuse me? That\u2019\
  s too much,\" I protested. And it stroke me that we were alone on a street remote\
  \ from common tourist spots. Shoe cleaner started to speak Turkish very fast. My\
  \ husband glanced at me swiftly and took out his wallet. The man swept away a few\
  \ bills as deftly as he did it with his small stool before. \n\n\"That\u2019s too\
  \ much,\" I replied. \n\"Ok, you take this, and I take that, and you take this,\"\
  \ man started juggling with bills very fast accompanying all this with very quick\
  \ chatter in Turkish. My husband gave me another quick glance so I decided to step\
  \ back. The shoe cleaner disappeared in the side street with our money. We left\
  \ standing there stunned for a few more minutes. \n\n\"And what was that?\" I asked\
  \ rhetorically\n\"That was a lesson for us,\" my husband replied calmly. \n\"Pretty\
  \ expensive one,\" I smirked and offered to stop taking life lessons for today.\
  \ \nAnd this is how we made our first local connection at Istanbul."
