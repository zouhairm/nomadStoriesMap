Text: Had a late night arrival in Puerto Montt, Chile.  It was cold.   A long uphill
  walk to Hostel Perla was next.  Had my rolling travois rig attached which took the
  weight off the old back but added considerable resistance going uphill.  Later this
  rolling rig would come in very handy for the 12 k walk  between Chile and Argentina
  with no pesos for a cab...but that comes later.  For now it was the welcome greeting
  of Perla in person at the hostel.  The hostel felt like visiting an aunt who you
  had not seen for years, complete with family photos on the wall.  Had been traveling
  for six weeks already through Columbia, Peru and Bolivia and did not think the trip
  to southern Patagonia and Torres Del Paine would be possible.  Had checked online  and  the
  airfare was a few hundred dollars to get there...but there was this flight to get
  back to Santiago for only $36!  Asking Perla about going south by bus she said it
  was possible as the bus loads on to ferrys to get through the islands.  Had ten
  days until a return flight to Peru from Santiago..so...why not go for it?  Ten days,
  2000 miles and no direct road...what could possibly go wrong?
