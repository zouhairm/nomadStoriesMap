Text: "The plank bed squeaks on the cold floor. Baring my weight it seems to crack\
  \ a little. At my feet lies a red, old, fringy blanket. The room is filled with\
  \ hot and damp air. The catheter sidles through the room, ends in its needle and\
  \ inside the crock of my arm. The Indonesian physician in sandals and t-shirt is\
  \ quiet. He knows I don\u2019t understand Bahasa, his Indonesian word for language.\
  \ He smiles. He does not understand English. \nLombok is ha hot place. In September\
  \ all the green of the island is gone. What is left is a sandy, brown and red hill\
  \ landscape that seems to reach into the sea and gets lost in the turquoise blue\
  \ ocean. Hot, fresh rice, eggs and greens damp in big pans in small caf\xE9s. Cows\
  \ cross the dusty streets. Mosquitoes buzz in the warm air. One of them bit me.\n\
  My dizzy head slowly turns clearer. The Indonesian whom I do not understand points\
  \ at the plastic bag that is attached to the needle in my arm - saline. The solution\
  \ resolves the queasy stomach and pain in the head. On the bed next to me lies a\
  \ man. His arm is also connected to a plastic bag that wields above his head. He\
  \ smiles. This is not his first time in a foreign hospital. The door opens and two\
  \ red and white cardboard boxes are being pushed in. \u201CPizza\u201D, says the\
  \ logo on the sides. Following the boxes is Dadi. \nDadi makes the world\u2019s\
  \ best banana pancakes. He owns the Tomato Caf\xE9 down the street that offers four\
  \ tables to guests. A handmade and carefully drawn sign of wood with crooked characters\
  \ hangs unobtrusively above the street and leads the way. \u201CTomato Caf\xE9\u201D\
  . It is his friendly face that makes the place with four tables special. Dadi brought\
  \ me here. He knows Bahasa. And he knows English. Dadi understands the Indonesian\
  \ man in a t-shirt and sandals. He understands me most of the time. And he brings\
  \ dinner for all of us \u2013 self-made pizza from the Tomato Caf\xE9. We share\
  \ the food in the midst of a medical practice in Kuta.\nIn Kuta people work with\
  \ smiles. And smiling brightens that very moment that I spend at an foreign physician\u2019\
  s place in the back of the home of an Indonesian family on a plank bed. The sun\
  \ sets outside. There is no loneliness - only smiles and the effort of communication\
  \ despite a language barrier. Tonight, after the saline has emptied into my body,\
  \ I sleep on the floor of Dadi's house. I am released from the bed and allowed into\
  \ freedom with an antibiotic addition to my medical resources. In the doctor's office\
  \ friendship supersedes foreignness. Caring compensates otherness. Dadi turns into\
  \ a friend."
