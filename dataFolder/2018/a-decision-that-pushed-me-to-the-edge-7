Text: "\u0410 decision that pushed me to the edge.\n. It was May. I usually was prepared\
  \ to go to University early morning. At that time, I studied English course. Suddenly\
  \ my phone called. It was the first time I heard his voice. Still I do not forget\
  \ this voice. Suraj Bulhasenov who was my first love.\nI am Sono Gayosova and was\
  \ born in Tajikistan. I am 29 years old and studying at the Tajik Technological\
  \ University of Tajikistan. \nSuraj always said that he will wait me as long as\
  \ it possible and if I can enter the university he will wait for me till finishing\
  \ my university..\nIn 2014 I enter the Technological university of Tajikistan and\
  \ it was successful because I passed my exam.   At that time, I was very happy.\
  \ When I told Suraj that I passed my exam successful and now I am student he was\
  \ not so happy. But still did not say anything. .\nAfter finishing my fist year\
  \ study in summer he said me that he must marry. And he wanted that I was his wife.\
  \ I said: I said that I can not because of my study.\n Then I talked with my mother\
  \ and my oldest sister about this problem that Suraj wants to married to me  and\
  \ I must stop my study.   My mother did not let me to stop study she said that both\
  \ of you must think how to go out from this problem and fined the best solution\
  \ for this   problem. After speaking with my mother about this  I thought a lot\
  \ and then I informed him about my family decision.\nThan both of us decided that\
  \ he will come to Dushanbe as he was outside from Tajikistan, then we will decide\
  \ what to do. After my summer holiday I came bachk to Dushanbe and  first of all\
  \ I sent massage to Suraj that did he bought a ticket from Russia to Tajikistan\
  \ or no. Than he called me in the evening and said I need to say you something.\
  \ Then he said I will not come to Dushanbe. I will get another girl not you.\n \
  \  After 18 days because of pain I was in hospital \n   I am very happy now. This\
  \ year I will finish my study. In future I want to open my own business and now\
  \ I am working on it.\nAlso I want to thank you for organizing this opportunity\
  \ of writing this story. Do you know that it was my dream to write about my life\
  \ story? And want to say that protect you beloved.  By the end of the essay I want\
  \ to mention that some people collect coins but I want to collect countries in order\
  \ to start my first trip from Argentina. Wish you good luck."
