Text: "I was going through a time in my life where I felt stagnate. After several\
  \ months of going through the motions, one night I went out with some friends. When\
  \ I got home I started searching colleges and entertaining the thought of starting\
  \ college at 27 years old. After a couple hours of the internet bringing me down\
  \ many different roads, and giving plenty of options I started to look up volunteering\
  \ with wild life. The homepage I landed on had many different locations and several\
  \ different animal options available. \nA couple years prior to this, I went to\
  \ Iceland and wanted to go to more places around the world, and do something way\
  \ different than Iceland. This is where South Africa stood out to me and was the\
  \ clear choice. \nThe next day I hadn't really put much thought process into the\
  \ volunteer application that I filled out the night before at 1 am. A day or 2 later,\
  \ I received an email stating that my application was accepted. My first thought\
  \ was \" how am I going to tell ma, I'm going to Africa ... Alone?\" \nFor my 28th\
  \ birthday, I was in the middle of South Africa at a primate sanctuary, having the\
  \ time of my life. Not to mention this decision has led to several other trips around\
  \ the world, and was the best choice I've made in my life. \nExperiencing other\
  \ cultures and seeing other countries makes you open your mind in ways you could\
  \ never expect. My money is better spent seeing as many places on Earth as possible,\
  \ which has given me relief in the stagnate life, I got caught up in."
