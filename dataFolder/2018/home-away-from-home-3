Text: "My first trip to Cape Town was in 2014. I had a township tour to Gugulethu\
  \ and surrounds, then to my final destination: Century City for resting and enjoying\
  \ my trip.\nNow, let me take you back to where I\u2019m from, which led to calling\
  \ Cape\nTown my second home. I come from an East London township called Mdantsane\
  \ in the Eastern Cape (EC), South Africa. Known for being the second the largest\
  \ township in the country geographically with Soweto taking first place Mdantsane\
  \ is divided in native units (N.U.). The units start from N.U. 1 to N.U. 18, adding\
  \ to that is unit P, Fort Jackson (industrial area) and other small places not named\
  \ as units. As big as Mdantsane is there isn\u2019t really much to do. There\u2019\
  s the beach, CBD area and malls, and that\u2019s it you\u2019ve made it in life.\n\
  My home is situated at N.U. 17; a unit that was idealy created for\ngovernment workers\
  \ during the apartheid era. The unit is/was for the middle class where we live in\
  \ our three-bedroomed houses, with big yards and tarred roads \u2013 obviously Mdantsane\
  \ is a bit developed now \u2013 see what I mean? We\u2019ve made it in life.\nBack\
  \ to my travel to the Mother City. My heart was yearning to get out of EL and explore\
  \ what\u2019s out there, because I believed there\u2019s more to life than what\
  \ EL offered \u2013 we haven\u2019t really made it in life. Opportunity came I grabbed\
  \ it.\nAs small as Gugulethu is to Mdantsane the livelihood was and still is\nexactly\
  \ the same. You had your section of the suburb areas \u2013 middle class \u2013\
  \ and your not so suburb areas \u2013 lower class, which are the most busiest areas\
  \ exactly like home. The class structure was and still is the same, people still\
  \ stereotype each other because of this.\nGugulethu is also divided on what they\
  \ call Native Yards (N. Y.). So, I\nrelated N. U. equals N. Y; same WhatsApp group.\
  \ It was lovely seeing children playing carelessly in the dusty streets, which was\
  \ something my siblings and I would do when vising my gandmother\u2019s house in\
  \ N. U. 9 because that was no allowed at my mom\u2019s place in N.U 17 the suburb.\
  \ Same happens in Gugs; the children from big houses don\u2019t play outside!\n\
  Lastly, reception from the coloured communities was as welcoming as it is home.\
  \ I mention race in this case because back home you\u2019ll hardly mingle with white\
  \ or Indian people. It is mostly Xhosa black and coloured people. After my township\
  \ tour of course I had to return to Century City to dine lavish and feel like I\u2019\
  ve made it in life the exact same feeling we get back home when we visit areas like\
  \ Stirling."
