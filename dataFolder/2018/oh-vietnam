Text: "In the Elephant Springs parking lot, I hobbled from my motorbike, over the\
  \ dust and stones, to the small slab of paving by the toilets. As I eased my shoe\
  \ off with great discomfort, my foot began to swell up like dough in an oven.\n\n\
  \u201CEww, that\u2019s disgusting!\u201D came the cry from a nearby tourist.\nBefore\
  \ I could even source the complainant, another girl \u2014 not unattractive \u2014\
  \ came racing over.\n\u201CDon\u2019t worry. I am nurse. Let me examine,\u201D she\
  \ adjured, with the hardy disposition of a woman in such a profession.\n\nAfter\
  \ playing the \u2018does this hurt\u2019 game, twisting it this way and that, we\
  \ both concluded that my foot was broken. I had taken a hair-pin corner too fast\
  \ coming down the Hai Van Pass, and being pinned down on black tar seal in forty-degree\
  \ midday sun, I had sustained an injury so typically 'Vietnam'.\n\nIn my solitude,\
  \ isolated between cities, I had little option but to keep riding; every gear change\
  \ excruciating with my snapped bones.\nI was hard-headed enough to stick to my schedule\
  \ of swimming at the Springs, but it was there I met Faye, the squeamish \u2018\
  ew\u2019 girl, and Catia, the aggressively caring Portuguese nurse.\nThey were sharing\
  \ a bike, and heading my direction.\n\nSomehow, they got me up the rocky, crevice-riddled\
  \ track to the Elephant\u2019s trunk upstream, where a homely Vietnamese woman welcomed\
  \ my broken body onto her riverside pontoon, offering me a sturdy branch to walk\
  \ with. But after a paddle around, the woman demanded payment. My new staunch Portuguese\
  \ friend refused her, and my walking stick was abruptly confiscated.\n\nBack on\
  \ the bikes, we rode through the evening toward Hue. As the setting Sun pierced\
  \ my bug-splattered visor, the highway shattered into roadworks. In the dark, I\u2019\
  d lose and find the girls between the flashing moonlit metals of speeding cars and\
  \ blaring buses. I tensely navigated by brake-light, feeling any moment could have\
  \ been my last. In several occasions, the roadworks forced our entire side of the\
  \ highway onto the other. No cones. No barriers.\nAs I rode into the oncoming stream\
  \ of headlights, I prayed that my tiny little headlight was enough.\nI saw a car.\
  \ It didn\u2019t see me. I had no room left to manoeuvre, and it was coming right\
  \ at me! I stood on my horn; frantic, and desperate to survive.\n\nIt moved.\n\n\
  At long last, we reached the Hue hospital. As the doctor was asleep in the x-ray\
  \ room, I spent the night on a stained public bed with a soggy toilet roll as a\
  \ pillow. The next day, that soggy paper became the first layer of my cast."
