Text: "On the shores of Hudson Bay, Canada, lies a town of contrasts, where the snow\
  \ reflects nuclear pink sunsets and belugas follow the tails of kayaks near the\
  \ port. \n\nIn this town, a kilogram of tomatoes is double the price of a bottle\
  \ of wine, and the prefab homes shake with the wind like a box of matches. Its name\
  \ is Churchill, the polar bear capital of the world, a land as hostile as it is\
  \ stunning.\n\nWhilst taking the train to Churchill, I envisioned myself living\
  \ a season off the grid. Those 46 hours traveling in a 1950`s-style carriage were\
  \ a journey of autumnal colors and stark prairies introducing the daybreak aligned\
  \ with the horizon. Having grown up in the Caribbean, the sensation of getting lost\
  \ in such an unfamiliar place thrilled me. \n\nThe landscape that encircles the\
  \ tundra is majestic. Sunny days are blinding the closer you get to the Arctic,\
  \ and the silence prevails at night in a land inhabited by furtive animals, such\
  \ as the arctic owl, the arctic fox and, with its super-star status, the polar bear.\
  \   \n\nI planned to stay there during the polar bear migration season toward the\
  \ bay, and got myself a job at a local restaurant. This is the peak season in Churchill\
  \ and each year it grows longer due to the rising temperatures delaying the freezing\
  \ of the bay, which serves the tourists and economy well, but unfortunately not\
  \ the bears...  \n\nI started my adventure with enthusiasm, not aware of the flood\
  \ of conflicting emotions I was going to face in this refuge for renegades, a mine\
  \ for temporary workers and a paradise for tourists seeking to experience \u201C\
  the wild\u201D. Travellers visit Churchill for an average of 3-4 days, flying in\
  \ from Winnipeg on an all-in package starting at $3000.\n\nI had invaluable experiences\
  \ in Churchill; being a few meters away from a polar bear, seeing the psychedelic\
  \ green shapes of the aurora painting the sky, spying on the foxes playing at night\
  \ in my front yard, and getting a taste of Inuit history. But, as I dug into the\
  \ soul of this remote town, I discovered a society wounded by alcohol and drug abuse,\
  \ domestic violence, and mental and physical health issues. Life can be hostile\
  \ in a place where the price of alcohol is regulated, but fresh food is not. Where\
  \ freezing 100Km/h winds from the bay leads to cabin fever.\n\nSurely everywhere\
  \ has its lights and shadows, and I now understand that polar bears are not the\
  \ biggest threat in Churchill."
