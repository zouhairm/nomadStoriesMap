Text: "As soon we step onto the tarmac, I recognise a familiar excitement in the pit\
  \ of my gut. Here, in Flores we are a stand-out trio: solo mum with crazy white-haired\
  \ son & loud baby in tow. \n\nOur drive from the airport is hairy. The driver belts\
  \ along beeping incessantly at anything in sight: children playing, oncoming scooters,\
  \ jeeps, grannies carrying grass baskets atop their heads and unaware chickens.\
  \ The seatbelt situation is below average so all I can do is breathe and repeat\
  \ hati-hati to him, whilst the boys happily enjoy their rocket-ride.\n\nMiraculously\
  \ unscathed and white-knuckled, we arrive at our destination. A few bamboo huts\
  \ overlook a calm bay, water clear as air. Wild jungle and a huge mountain range\
  \ loom behind us. The energy is slow, deep, magnetic.\n\nWe settle into our beachfront\
  \ digs, a tiny hut with grass roof and rickety bamboo floor. Our shower is cold\
  \ running tap and our toilet we flush by hand with a little pink bucket.\n\nThe\
  \ beach before us is alive with life. Tiny waves lick the shoreline as ubiquitous\
  \ hermit crabs give the illusion that the ground moves beneath us. Fishermen cast\
  \ nets from tiny wooden boats: their lives, days dictated by season and tide. Not\
  \ a fish goes wasted, everything captured is recycled \u2013 breathed new life as\
  \ bait or fried with lunch.\n\nOur circadian rhythms have us up at dawn. Days are\
  \ whiled away swimming, exploring rock pools, discovering beautiful shells. We take\
  \ trips out to islands on noisy slow wooden boats, trying to decipher a horizon\
  \ between a sea of silky glass and a sky of shape-shifter clouds, before diving\
  \ into bottomless crystal blue waters. We eat boiled jagung like there is no tomorrow.\
  \ My son surprises me with his blossoming Indonesian vocab and we stop at almost\
  \ every local we pass on the beach in order to have a little conversation with them\
  \ while they squeeze the baby\u2019s cheeks. Most afternoons, thunderstorms streak\
  \ across the bay and the blues of the bay give way to grey.\n\nAfter a few days,\
  \ we travel to another beach on the other side of the island, where we eat barbequed\
  \ fish and sip coconuts. Within minutes my son is frolicking in the translucent\
  \ water with ten other Indonesian boys his same age. They have no common language\
  \ between them but they bob around in the sea, toying with driftwood and coconuts.\
  \ They squawk and wrestle and tease each other until it\u2019s late and I literally\
  \ have to drag him away."
