Text: "Hello fellows, \nI am Swamini Chauhan. I have decided to write my experience\
  \ about my vacation in Goa which is one of the most preferred destination for vacation\
  \ in India because of unique culture and enchantingly beautiful beaches with specialty\
  \ as  sea food. My vacation in Goa was about 7 days in other words, it was about\
  \ for a week. As a residence of India I already had my perception about Goa. It's\
  \ like another country because of it completely different culture and living. I\
  \ found everything very fascinating. The beaches in Goa are the main tourist attractions\
  \ : Baga beach, Calangut beach, Anjuna beach and of course not to forget the Cruise.\
  \ My vacation was not only limited to the beaches and Cruise but also museum and\
  \ church as I am very fond of historical places especially when it has it's connections\
  \ with Portuguese and British. I went to Saint Francis Xavier Church and museum\
  \ and as you know the story behind each historical monument has it's own shocking\
  \ tape to tell. So I was completely in awe about it and from that moment I fell\
  \ more in love with English and Portuguese culture. You went on vacation to Goa\
  \ and didn't bought \"Fenny \" with you? Well your vacation was not worth it. Fenny\
  \ is a country alcoholic beverage which can only be found in Goa and is so popular\
  \ to be eaten with sea food. So yeah, I bought this tangy beverage with me and was\
  \ so satisfied with myself because let's get simple that whenever you buy something\
  \ on your vacation, the sole purpose is to create memory and share our experience\
  \ with our mates. Trust me in Goa you'll love the market of Dona Paula where you\
  \ find everything you need as I found especially the footwears. I was in love with\
  \ them."
