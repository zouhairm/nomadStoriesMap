Text: "Three women waited on the doorstep of a private home in suburban Costa Rica.\
  \ It was a sunny yet brisk afternoon, typical of the central valley boots and jackets\
  \ weather in an otherwise tropical  country with stunning shorelines. \nI\u2019\
  d met the other two girls in Ometepe, an exotic and fauna filled volcano island\
  \ in southern Nicaragua. Sandra and I had both canceled our return tickets to New\
  \ York and were traveling indefinitely \u2013 Helena was from Costa Rica, and invited\
  \ us both to visit her in San Jose where she lived and worked as a documentary filmmaker.\
  \   When we all met up at Helena\u2019s apartment, Sandra revealed that she'd come\
  \ to Costa Rica to find her father, who she\u2019d never met. She discovered that\
  \ he'd been dead for 23 years, and had left behind a wife and children.  None of\
  \ them knew anything of Sandra or her mother, who'd had an affair many years ago\
  \ with Sandra's father.  She was already back in the US before Sandra was born.\
  \ \nHere we were, about to tell our story to whoever answered.  Helena would do\
  \ the talking, and she would also ask for permission to videotape the encounter.\
  \ \nThe front door opened and a middle aged woman beheld her unexpected visitors:\
  \ two foreigners, and a local Costa Rican holding a very blatant camera.  Helena\
  \ began to speak in Spanish, and I read the woman's slow acceptance of our visit\
  \ as she invited us in for coffee and conversation, in the true spirit of Latin\
  \ hospitality.  It wasn't long before a respectful bond was created between a long\
  \ deceased man's widow and his daughter from a woman she\u2019d never known about,\
  \ solidified by the piles of photos she eagerly shared with her. \nAt various points\
  \ in the afternoon, Sandra\u2019s brothers and sisters came home and were met the\
  \ surprise of their 28-year-old American half-sister, which they greeted with acceptance.\
  \  Where one void would always remain in the form of a lost father, Sandra discovered\
  \ her siblings.   \"I'm going to stay and get to know my family,\" she said happily\
  \ a few hours later, indicating that Helena and I could go home. \nShortly thereafter,\
  \ Sandra bought a ticket back to New York. Her eyes moistened as we recorded one\
  \ last interview in Helena's apartment before the taxi arrived.  Her trip finally\
  \ felt complete, and she was ready to fall back into the swing of her everyday life\
  \ at home.   But I wasn't. On a whim, I decided to stay in San Jose and became roommates\
  \ with one of Helena\u2019s friends.  Costa Rica was not done with me."
