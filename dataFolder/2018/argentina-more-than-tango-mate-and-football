Text: "Argentina is one of the most famous countries of all America. This included\
  \ a lot of stereotypes. Land of tango, mate and football, could be an example.\n\
  The objective of our travel story is to talk about this country, in a different\
  \ way. Creating a new vision of the destination. Obviously we have to write about\
  \ the traditions, ant this include some models. But we want to know more about this\
  \ country. The propose is do an important job as a real fam/press trip. My main\
  \ objective: do an extended article to show the result in some magazines and other\
  \ internet sites (I have relations with important media). \nI have the advantage\
  \ to be Spanish native and this is a great opportunity to know more about the country\
  \ and make a great local connection while our visit. I know people from Argentina\
  \ \u2013not the country- and I can affirm, the essence of this country of South\
  \ America, came from the people. People who lives in the streets most of the time.\
  \ Spontaneous relations between shopkeepers, artists, tourist, business men\u2026\
  \ and travel journalist, why not!\nI want to talk with all of this \u2013included\
  \ the tourist- to configure and new image of the country, more than the typical\
  \ models. An image that only can give us the real people. More than this models\
  \ who appear in the local brochures or internet videos. Know the reality, to the\
  \ show other people the most important thing of travel: learn new realities around\
  \ the world by the local people. \nI want to know more about Argentina. Talk about\
  \ realities, more than tango, mate, Maradona or Messi. Go far. Looking in the heart\
  \ of the Argentinians to reach the heart of the rest of the world with our local\
  \ connections. \nI hope I could contribute with this articles. I am sure we can\
  \ do toghether."
