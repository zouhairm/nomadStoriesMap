Text: "Narrow alleys, solely illuminated by rays of sunlight glancing through the\
  \ collection of roofs, aren\u2019t easy to navigate. I'm lost. I don\u2019t pressure\
  \ myself to identify a way out, though. Unknown smells and intriguing colours guide\
  \ me as I vagabond around in relaxed atmosphere. Out of nowhere a kid recklessly\
  \ races past me, virtually tripping over a sleepy street dog in front of us, dashing\
  \ into a tiny shop on the corner of the alley. \nPuzzled about what possibly could\
  \ be that highly anticipated in this area, I stumble in the shop to find out. I\u2019\
  m squeezed into a queue of men. As I get closer to the counter I see everyone receiving\
  \ a soft, warm pita bread with sliced meat in it, including me. I didn't ask for\
  \ it, but I was too overwhelmed to say anything, yet alone to curious to find out\
  \ what I have gotten myself into. The pile of men proceeds slowly deeper inside\
  \ the tiny shop, squashing me in the far left corner. For a brief moment, I pass\
  \ a wooden table with a sauce-soaked blanket. Five different bowls offer green salad,\
  \ sun-dried tomatoes and sauces in various colours. I take a small portion of vegetables\
  \ and swiftly pour a bit of every sauce onto my pita bread, trying to spill as less\
  \ as humanly possible in this maniac crowd. I find myself standing next to three\
  \ men in front of the wall, utterly amazed by the bizarre situation, until the warm\
  \ steam of the pita bread and the delicious smell of the meat grasp my attention.\
  \ The man on the far right takes a batch of napkins, uses two and passes them along.\
  \ My neighbour uses another, and passes them wordless to me. I hand the last two\
  \ napkins to the kid on my left. It feels like we had shared this brief lunch break\
  \ a million times with each other. In this seemingly natural moment the men next\
  \ to me give me the particular feeling, that I\u2019m one of them. I\u2019m welcome.\
  \ It\u2019s the simple moments in life we can draw the most of. \nAfter gorging\
  \ down that delicious piece of food I see the men disappearing in the crowd. While\
  \ hustling my way out, I catch a glimpse of a small Iraqi flag on the counter and\
  \ put some notes next to it. I look at the vendor, he smiles at me. I smile back\
  \ and disappear in the dim alleys of the bazar."
