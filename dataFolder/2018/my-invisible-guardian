Text: "I had never held a weapon before.  Its dull metal and lifeless wood felt evil.\
  \ As the gun lay firmly in my hands, its solid weight crept coldly up my arms, squeezed\
  \ my chest with a gasp, then sat upon my heart with the chill ache of death. To\
  \ my left, the owner of this Kalashnikov smiled beatifically at my awkwardness,\
  \ then nervously fingered the camera that hung obtrusively around his neck.\n\n\
  One week ago, I had arrived in Ethiopia to hike the sky-scraping plateaus of the\
  \ Simien Highlands. I was taken aback when my guide Jemal introduced me to a handsome\
  \ young man cradling an AK-47 machine gun. Molla was our personal body guard for\
  \ this trip, though what he was guarding us from I wasn\u2019t quite sure.  \n\n\
  \u201CWho is this Molla?\u201D I wondered, as I watched him saunter lackadaisically\
  \ behind our group, his rifle casually slung over one shoulder as he shuffled along\
  \ in his black Adidas beach sandals. He was my invisible guardian\u2014always present\
  \ but seldom seen. My question remained unanswered for now because we didn\u2019\
  t share a language. How could I approach Molla to establish rapport before I peppered\
  \ Jemal with questions about my reticent guard?\n\nThe next morning the burnished\
  \ sky blazed blue through the gaps in the giant heather branches. We had arrived\
  \ at Imet Gogo, a scenic overlook at 3926 meters. For the first time, Molla was\
  \ at our side peering with us at the collected grains of salt that were villages\
  \ below. Suddenly, I knew how to break the silent barrier between Molla and me.\
  \ Through Jemal, I asked Molla to please take a photo with me, but with one special\
  \ request: I wanted to switch roles with him. I would hold the rifle and Molla would\
  \ wear my DSLR camera. That is how I came to grasp a Kalashnikov for the first time.\
  \ To see Molla smile at the humor of our role reversal made this brief encounter\
  \ a longed-for chance to open a conversation with him.\n\nThrough Jemal, I learned\
  \ that Molla lived in the village of Mekarebia with his wife and five children.\
  \ His Kalashnikov was his weapon during the Eritrean-Ethiopian War. Jemal said we\
  \ needed Molla to protect us from bandits, but the most important reason was to\
  \ employ him so he could support his family.\n\nAt Imet Gogo\u2019s edge, the world\
  \ fell away at my feet. Skirting the edge of a vertiginous cliff, I marveled at\
  \ the massive eroded rock molars which rose from a kilometer below. Chilly updrafts\
  \ lifted Molla\u2019s voice as he sang a haunting tune to the void. In this moment,\
  \ I knew I had found a place like no other."
