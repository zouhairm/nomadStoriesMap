Text: "In the darkest days of my depression, I didn\u2019t dream at all. \n\nWhen\
  \ I did finally dream, it was of being lost in a vast expanse of snow. Shadows of\
  \ penguins moved towards me, though I hardly registered their presence. My soul\
  \ was exhausted. Yet, as the penguins approached, I could feel the numbness in my\
  \ body dissipate. The intensity of love they radiated was so immense, that I interpreted\
  \ them to be spiritual messengers. When I woke, there was no doubt \u2013  I had\
  \ to find a penguin and a way to reconnect with life.\n\nI set out to New Zealand\
  \ to see the rare yellow-eyed penguin, but life was not about to hand me an epiphany\
  \ so easily. To meet a penguin, would mean testing my commitment.\n\nThe bike I\
  \ borrowed from my campground had been run over by a car. The chain fell off a dozen\
  \ times. The handlebar constantly slipped out of position. The brakes didn\u2019\
  t work, but that hardly mattered since a bent rim was pushing against them. A cloud\
  \ of anguish hung over me as I set out on a journey that seemed doomed to fail.\n\
  \nFueled by determination, I gripped the handles and steadied myself as best I could\
  \ on a bike that could easily send a rider to their grave. I wobbled slowly down\
  \ the highway shoulder as huge trucks barrelled past just feet away. \n\nOff the\
  \ highway was a gravel road made entirely of hills. My bike slipped and skidded\
  \ as if I was riding through snow. Each uphill battle forced me to dismount and\
  \ push the bike, while heading downhill was a balancing act that could have earned\
  \ me a place in the circus. \nWhen the first penguin came to shore, every bit of\
  \ negativity I had been feeling vanished.  A penguin is so charmingly ridiculous,\
  \ one can\u2019t help but feel joy watching them waddle. \n\nMore penguins clamored\
  \ their way up the cliff at Katiki Point, standing only feet away from me. The setting\
  \ sun warned of a dangerous journey back, but I was transfixed. A symbol of resilience,\
  \ the penguins ignited in me the determination to survive - not only the harrowing\
  \ trek, but also the seemingly insurmountable difficulties of life.\n\nI pedalled\
  \ down the darkening highway without the safety of light or helmet. The wind from\
  \ each passing semi threatened to topple me from my broken bike. If I died this\
  \ night, I would do so contentedly, my mission accomplished. The dream that had\
  \ sent me in search of penguins, had allowed me to rediscover my spirit.\n\nAs I\
  \ pulled into the campground, the owner came out to meet me. \u201CDidn\u2019t anybody\
  \ tell you we have bikes that aren\u2019t broken?\u201D"
