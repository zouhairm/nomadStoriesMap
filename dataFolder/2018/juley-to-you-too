Text: "That\u2019s how I responded when I met Bobo outside his house when I was walking\
  \ all alone as a tourist in the deserted city of Leh in the state of Jammu & Kashmir\
  \ in India during the month of January.  The midday sun was shining bright with\
  \ the warmth penetrating to my bones, which had otherwise been exposed to sub-zero\
  \ temperatures for the last 24 hours since I arrived.  Winters is not usually the\
  \ time when tourists visit Leh, when even most of the locals leave the city for\
  \ extended periods to stay in warmer areas like Srinagar or Goa for those who can\
  \ afford to, like Bobo. \n\nBobo is the owner of the oldest hotel in Leh which was\
  \ started by his grandfather once tourism was allowed in the 1970s. After Bobo very\
  \ graciously invited me in for some hot honey-lemon tea, he told me how he completed\
  \ his education in Dalhousie which is a hill station in the state of Himachal Pradesh\
  \ and how education has always been a high area of focus for the local residents,\
  \ especially education of the girl-child which is unfortunately still quite rare\
  \ in many parts of India.\n\nSipping the second round of honey-lemon tea and eating\
  \ moti-chur laddoos which is a popular Indian sweet, \u201Cnothing\u201D was the\
  \ answer Bobo gave me after much thought when I asked him what worried him the most.\
  \ Sitting in his living room which had furniture in bright blue and red colors and\
  \ large portions of the walls and floors draped with authentic woolen carpets which\
  \ was typical of the local homes, he continued to recount his life and how lucky\
  \ he thought he was for having been born in Leh as life was very peaceful with no\
  \ stress.  He also mentioned that there was no point keeping the hotel open for\
  \ winter as the running costs were more than the money he might make and that he\
  \ had more than sufficient and he would not know what to do with more. He was due\
  \ to leave for his annual trip to Goa in a few days with his wife and was just waiting\
  \ for her to finish up in the only local government hospital where she worked as\
  \ a gynecologist.\n \nWe spoke for about a couple of hours and as I was slowly walking\
  \ back to my accommodation, I was still thinking of the extreme peace and calm I\
  \ saw in Bobo\u2019s eyes and wondered what an even more wonderful world this would\
  \ be if more of us could be even half as peaceful and content. I still sometimes\
  \ think of the moment when Bobo bid me goodbye outside his home that afternoon with\
  \ a \"Juley\", the local magic word for hello, goodbye, thank you, how are you or\
  \ you\u2019re welcome."
