Text: "That wasn\u2019t the first time I went to Paris. The few details I remembered\
  \ were frames of me on a playground near the Champs Elys\xE9es hanging on parallel\
  \ bars followed by some French kids who appreciated my technique. And of course,\
  \ Disneyland. This time was expected to be sensitively different from that one.\
  \ I had a summer scholarship to do some practice at Saint Joseph Hospital at 14th\
  \ district, so I decided to install myself at the Cit\xE9 Universitaire. \nIt was\
  \ placed on the edge of zone 1 and composed by singular dormitories from many countries\
  \ all over the world. A Versaillesque garden led us to the main building, the headquarter\
  \ office of that little UN. Behind, a large field of grass surrounded by dense trees\
  \ and paths perfect full of runners let us watch the Thai\u2019s marble fa\xE7ade\
  \ flanked by two big dragon-shaped sculptures. The modern Japanese house combined\
  \ a pagoda-style roof with a vanguard structure. Le Courvoisier was in charge of\
  \ the design of Swiss stylish dormitory. I loved Norwegian brick walls all covered\
  \ in intense green vines. My home was the Coll\xE8ge d\u2019Espagne, a white 4-floor\
  \ building which reminds me a white version of the Alc\xE1zar of Toledo somehow.\
  \ The cozy rooms were nothing compared with the common areas, especially the kitchen.\
  \ \n     There, at any time you could find an interesting mind to talk to or just\
  \ some people singing and playing the guitar as loud as the doorkeeper allowed us.\
  \ The patchwork of intellectuals assured never getting bored. Painters, musicians,\
  \ philosophers, scientists, physicists, physicians\u2026all of them were avid explorers\
  \ of Parisian city life. We bonded like a family. Ana, a young sharp-eyed journalist,\
  \ heard about free \u201CSwedish aerobic\u201D classes at Montsouris Park, just\
  \ in front of the Cit\xE9, so I decided to join her. The awkwardness was promptly\
  \ substituted by a rush of endorphins and laughter when we saw in that circle around\
  \ the teacher not only our tiny selves but also Antonio and Manuel doing their best\
  \ with flexibility exercises. Silvia found a last-minute discount for the opera\
  \ thus we could assist to Don Giovanni and Madame Butterfly for an affordable price.\
  \ Together, we discovered some of the city secrets: the delicacies of the Quartier\
  \ Latin, a gallery of young alternative artists at 59th Rivoli, a Jazz Festival\
  \ on the city outskirts and much more. \nI never could imagine finding these incredible\
  \ people, able to embrace French culture and even merge it with Spanish lifestyle."
