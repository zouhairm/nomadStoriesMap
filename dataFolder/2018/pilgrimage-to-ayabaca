Text: "I first saw him in the desert, hanging from the rearview mirror of a tiny,\
  \ yellow taxi. And then I saw him everywhere. He wears the sequined robe of a middleweight\
  \ champion, his hair past his shoulders in black ringlets. He's gaunt\u2014wooden\u2014\
  over 250 years old. Hailing from high in the Peruvian Andes, each year thousands\
  \ ascend to glimpse him. \n\nImagine dragging a ninety-kilo cross up from sea level\
  \ to 2700 meters. Imagine doing it in sandals made from old tires. You may have\
  \ traced the burning coast for hundreds of kilometers already. If this pilgrimage\
  \ was a road race, its souvenir shirt would sport some strange sponsors. Everyone\u2019\
  s carrying Panadol extra fuerte, a strong pain killer. Droves nurse blisters and\
  \ drink Chicha, alcohol made from corn and fermented with human saliva. Pilgrims\
  \ pad their shoes with tampons. Used ones are strewn all over the road alongside\
  \ blown out flip-flops. All along the way, there is this most curious residue of\
  \ devotion.\n\nImagine crawling toward the cathedral in each pueblo you pass through,\
  \ pulling your body with your forearms, your crew behind you. It\u2019s like a parade\
  \ with marching bands, except for baton twirlers there are people dragging themselves\
  \ along the ground. Instead of trumpets, girls clap tambourines and boys whack drums\
  \ stretched with animal skins, the hair in the sweet spot beaten off. This day near\
  \ dusk they are muddy in the rain and tremble from the cold.\n\nFamilies walk too.\
  \ And people walk alone. Heavy people walk, and people who shouldn\u2019t walk because\
  \ of illness or infirmity, walk. Children too tired to go on get slung on backs\
  \ or hang in heavy cloth stretched between poles. At night, devotees blanket plazas,\
  \ sleep jackknifed in shops and on stoops. They share fish and rice in tent towns.\
  \ There\u2019s music, massage, and fresh pineapple juice.\n\nSleep fast. You begin\
  \ again at 3 a.m.\n\nImagine walking into church on Sunday to find body lumped by\
  \ body, everywhere, the soft murmur of private prayer. The sanctuary glows. Lifted\
  \ air quakes with heat. A man clasps a bouquet of candles. He stands, eyes closed,\
  \ wax running down his hands. People crowd the stairs up to the three-story altar.\
  \ Do you hear the wailing woman? She prays for a dead son, a sick husband. She has\
  \ stood in line all night, walked for days before, all to smooth the hem of the\
  \ effigy\u2019s robe between her fingers. Thousands more do the same. They wind\
  \ out the door, dot a line down the mountain. \n\nHis image floats above the mud\
  \ on petals of flowers."
