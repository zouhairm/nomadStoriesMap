Text: "Dread. Dictionary.com defines it as: \u201Cto fear greatly\u201D. \nI say it\
  \ is walking 3 blocks to where I parked my rental car in frustration 39 hours ago,\
  \ saying: \u201CI will not drive again in Greece!\u201D \nIt is 9 AM and with each\
  \ step, a cacophony of sounds and smells alert me that Minoos Street is no longer\
  \ a road, but a bustling street market. I turn the corner, revealing stall upon\
  \ stall of produce and wares for sale. I hurriedly begin dodging people and stalls,\
  \ certain that when I arrive, there will be no blue Fiat waiting for me. At last\
  \ I spy a tiny patch of blue metal, poking through tarps and overflowing boxes.\
  \ My car is there! It hasn\u2019t been towed! Instead, it is covered in vegetables,\
  \ completely wedged in by market stalls. \nFearfully, I ask the stall vendor next\
  \ to it, if he speaks English. He curtly replies: \u201Ca little.\u201D He says\
  \ the market closes at 2 PM, and I will have to wait. I explain that I must leave\
  \ immediately as I have a ferry to catch. He suggests I drive the car through the\
  \ sea of people- slowly. Helpless, knowing there is no way I can extricate the car,\
  \ let alone drive it up a street filled with hundreds of people milling about, I\
  \ ask if I pay him, can he do it? To my shock he says: \u201Cyes\u201D, and to wait.\
  \ He hands me a spanakopita, and says brusquely: \u201CEat!\u201D Dumbfounded, I\
  \ stand there eating his pie, child-like, afraid of what\u2019s coming next. He\
  \ and a young man move the crates off and around the car, leaving a foot of clearance\
  \ on each end. I offer to help, and am again told simply to: \u201CEat\u201D. I\
  \ watch as he gets in and laboriously frees the car. \nHe tells me to get in the\
  \ car, and then he literally drives it THROUGH the market, honking and yelling to\
  \ everyone through the open windows. The only word I can decipher is: \"touristas\"\
  , and I know that I am the excuse he is using for driving through. I ask his name,\
  \ and find Demetrio speaks English perfectly. To my surprise, he softens and says\
  \ it is the Greek government\u2019s fault, for no signage indicating the street\
  \ is closed on Saturdays. \nReturning to the B&B, I am met outside by my frantic\
  \ mother, the owner and the receptionist, who apologizes for forgetting to tell\
  \ me about the Saturday market. We load the car, walk back to Demetrio\u2019s stall\
  \ and I offer him money which he refuses, instead handing my mother a plump bunch\
  \ of grapes, saying simply: \u201CEat!\u201D\nHospitality. Dictionary.com defines\
  \ it as: \u201Cfriendly reception and treatment of strangers\u201D. \nI say it is\
  \ Demetrio- vegetable vendor of Chania."
