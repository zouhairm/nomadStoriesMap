Text: "I reached the pinnacle, I had everything I had hoped and dreamed of having;\
  \ an abundant bank account, a penthouse apartment in downtown Manhattan overlooking\
  \ the Hudson, a doorman, saltwater pool and a successful boyfriend. The only problem\
  \ was that I no longer wanted any of it. I had spent all of this time with my head\
  \ down working tirelessly in the city that never sleeps to accomplish something\
  \ that turned out to have very little value to me. It was a crushing reality to\
  \ be faced with. I decided to remedy this and I began to look into a trip abroad\
  \ in hopes traveling would breath some vitality and clarity into my life.\nWhile\
  \ doing research I came across a National Geographic special that highlighted the\
  \ ancient ceremonial traditions of healers and medicine men in South America. I\
  \ was wowed by the claims of healing that countless people reported and I knew then\
  \ I had to see for myself.  At the time my boyfriend was one of the foremost authorities\
  \ of the efficacy of pharmaceuticals in the world. I brought the information I stumbled\
  \ across to his attention and his response was that of laughter, \"my dear, with\
  \ all of the trillions the pharmaceutical companies possess, if these plants and\
  \ 'medicines' actually worked, don't you think they would put them into a pill and\
  \ sell them to the masses?\" \nThe next week I made the decision to leave my job,\
  \ give away my possessions, leave my boyfriend and take the leap of faith into the\
  \ path of finding purpose. Four days later I was on an airplane to Ecuador and was\
  \ immediately immersed in the world of shamans and healers who worked with the plants\
  \ of the Amazon, the so-called medicine cabinet of the world. I spent nearly two\
  \ years living between the mountains of Ecuador and the Amazon regions of Peru assisting\
  \ people from around the world heal a broad spectrum of ailments. I never would\
  \ have believed the miraculous healing properties unless I had seen them for myself.\
  \ It gave me a completely new perspective on the ancient traditions and cultures\
  \ all around the world, and in the process I found  true purpose, a purpose that\
  \ can be applied to all of us; to help people and to be of service to the world."
