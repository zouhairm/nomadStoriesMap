Text: "Arriving at Mexico City one week after the earthquake was a difficult coincidence\
  \ that led me to know the town in a strange new light. First, through the general\
  \ feeling of panic in the air and later through the passionate heart and resolve\
  \ of the Mexican people.\n\nI suposse that in the weeks that followed everyone was\
  \ trying to find explanations for the disaster. The metro smelled of tahini and\
  \ sweat, while mournful stories of those who died were interchanged. My laberynthine\
  \ travels, which started on 3rd line, station C.U to end on 7th line station Polanco\
  \ hinted at the sheer size of the city. \n\nI found myself with Julieta, a mexican\
  \ friend, in a food court. At the table an order of tlayudas, grasshoppers, guacamole\
  \ and beer. After so much food and flavors, a artisan mezcal \"Pelot\xF3n de la\
  \ muerte joven\". There, we caught up on past events and earthquake. She told me\
  \ how people were confused when the earthquake first struck for there was no alarm.\
  \ No one knew for sure that there was an earthquake, until the shaking intensified\
  \ and panic started to break out. We left the food court and walked by Reforma Street,\
  \ which seemed to stretch out into infinity among the trees and buildings that lined\
  \ it. \n\nLater I returned to my residence at a colorful neighbourhood with houses\
  \ with many floors, each constructed by different hands according to different tastes\
  \ that reflected the diverse, colorful atmosphere common to the mexican urban cityscape.\
  \ My house happened to have a door to the void and a terrace without bars and a\
  \ beautiful hammock.\n\nI met with Julieta the next day, this time we walked by\
  \ Z\xF3calo plaza, below which was the Templo Mayor, the ancient Mayan temple and\
  \ on which the church stood that was closed by the earthquake. Julieta continued\
  \ telling me about the earthquake. It seemed like the reason why the alarm didn\u2019\
  t sound off when the earthquake happened was due to a new fault line opening up\
  \ in an area that had no seismographs. Julieta tell me about the fault lines. It\
  \ was at that time that I learnt that the active fault line was called Guerero,\
  \ yet the new fault line had no name. She also told me how she felt herself sway\
  \ under the mercurial ground beneath her, We would go on to spend that day until\
  \ 8 00 p.m. getting to know more of the downtown area, Madero street, an ancient,\
  \ narrow street full of history, and some nearby book tianguis. We finally ended\
  \ up in a place where mexican cumbia rang out among \u201Ccahuama\u201D beer and\
  \ danced all night long."
