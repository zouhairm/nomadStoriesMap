Text: "I get on a train one night from Delhi to Ahmedabad (usually a 12 hour journey)\
  \ eager to reach my film school the next day. I follow my seat number to a coupe,\
  \ to realise that I would be sharing it with a few goon looking guys, who are about\
  \ to start a night of revelry. I get creeped out, a bit worried about my safety\
  \ - especially once the doors would shut. When the ticket collector came, I over\
  \ enthusiastically enquired the exact arrival time to my destination. He nonchalantly\
  \ told me that my destination is actually 42 hours away & not the 12, I had imagined.\
  \ My travel agent had goofed up. Too late to get off the train, too late to catch\
  \ a flight.\n\nOn request, they helped me change my cabin, and my new set of co-passengers\
  \ - an old Korean couple who spoke no English. The gentleman picks up his little\
  \ English-Korean dictionary, trying to initiate a conversation with me. He told\
  \ me that they were in India for a week and every evening they would get into a\
  \ train that took them to their next destination in the morning. His continuing\
  \ eager questions about Indian population & economy, made me do a quick fact check,\
  \ but I was fascinated by their travel plan. Next morning, I felt someone tucking\
  \ me in. I must have sprawled and my bedding was falling off it. The couple waved\
  \ and the door shut. \n\nA few hours later, I wake up to realise that everyone had\
  \ left the train. The empty train meandered through the Indian hinterland, as I\
  \ stare outside the windows at my detoured landscape. Being all alone on a 36 bogie\
  \ train was funny as well as empowering.\n\nBy evening people stated trickling in\
  \ and my new co-passengers are an Indian family who are returning home from their\
  \ Srilanka trip. Having never been there, I was super curious about their experiences.\
  \ The young daughter explained the main difference was that the Lankans celebrated\
  \ Ravana as a God - contrary to him being considered the enemy God in India with\
  \ his effigies being burnt at festivals! \n\nAmused at my tectonic shift of ideas\
  \ the father tells me - Do you realise that you are on a very important journey?\n\
  \nDid he mean - the journey by the biggest idiot in history to end up in the longest\
  \ train journey ever?\n\nInstead, he states that once this train reaches the destination,\
  \ it will be decommissioned as part of the Railways upgradation plans. This was\
  \ the last journey made by this meter gauge train and that we were lucky to be part\
  \ of it.\n\nSome journeys take you places, while some spaces bring journeys together."
