Text: "\"D\xE9paysement\" is a French word that refers to the feeling of being lost\
  \ and far away from everything you are used to.\nTo understand le d\xE9paysement\
  \ I had to wait until I was 25, when, unexpectedly I got paid for a past job, a\
  \ big + 4 digit number on my bank account appearing suddenly on a boring, cold January\
  \ day. \nI called my best friend right away. I said: \"let's go to Asia\", he said\
  \ \"I am in\" as we have been both adventurous in our life and felt ready for something\
  \ big and radically new.\nHow we decided to go to Asia? The idea came from a book,\
  \ written by Muriel Cerf, about a hippie girl going in the 70's through India and\
  \ living an adventure of a lifetime.\nWe decided to leave in 2 weeks, no time to\
  \ prepare a detailed itinerary, we would start from Hanoi and backpack our way to\
  \ Singapore.\nGoodbye Paris, cold and unwelcoming, not even bringing a jacket, because\
  \ the backpack was full enough, gray Parisians staring at us on the metr\xF2, eyebrows\
  \ raised. 20 hours and 2 layovers later we arrived in Hanoi.\n\nI cannot describe,\
  \ yet I cannot forget, the feeling of going out of the plane and the airport. The\
  \ air so warm, so humid, the SMELL of the tropics, the palm trees.\n\nThe people,\
  \ the beautiful Vietnamese people, not speaking English but making themselves understood\
  \ perfectly, the traffic in the city, a crowd of scooters following no rule. An\
  \ old man helped us crossing the street the first time, walking so naturally we\
  \ could not believe how he was not scared of the incoming motorbikes, beeping incessantly.\
  \ It then became so natural to us, we find ourselves sometimes even now crossing\
  \ the streets in Europe \"Asian style\" with a smooth continuous movement. Our friends\
  \ wait at the traffic lights and think we are totally crazy.\n\nIn Vietnam I was\
  \ the happiest I ever was but also the scariest. For example, when I had to walk\
  \ through cages full of hissing pythons, hundreds of them, bred along the Mekong\
  \ river. I got also very sick and I was in a bungalow on an island and I thought\
  \ feverishly \"maybe I won't make it back\", but I did, thanks to my friend who\
  \ was force-feeding me white rice every day until I could stand again.\n\nSince\
  \ that time I went back to Asia twice more and I would go back every year. But the\
  \ world is big and I need to see it ALL.\n\nIn Amsterdam I once met an artist who\
  \ said that \"adventure can be found at home\". Well, let me disagree, the real\
  \ adventure starts when you go out of your comfort zone and open your eyes to the\
  \ world."
