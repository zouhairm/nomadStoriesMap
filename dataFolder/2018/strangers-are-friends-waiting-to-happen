Text: "After our one week diving adventure on Bastimentos Island in Panama was called\
  \ off due to extreme weather, my travel partner and I scrambled to find an interesting\
  \ location in the country that wasn't affected by the storm to spend our time. \
  \ We took  a harrowing bus ride over washed out roads to the small village of Boquete.\n\
  \nWe instantly fell in love with the charming mountain town.  Besides the abundance\
  \ of natural beauty, it was the locals who made us want to stay forever.  Everywhere\
  \ we went, people greated us with a smile and \"hola\".  While asking around about\
  \ things to do, we were given the information for a local hiking guide, Carlos.\
  \  We arranged to do the world famous \"Sendero Los Quetzales\" in hopes of spotting\
  \ the elusive mystical bird.\n\nWhen Carlos met us at the trailhead, we immediately\
  \ felt a connection.  His personality was much bigger than his 5'5\" frame and his\
  \ laugh was infectious.  We were amazed by his strength as he moved huge rocks in\
  \ cascading rivers to build bridges so that we would not have to get our feet wet.\
  \  Although we were not lucky enough to spot any Quetzals, we had a fantastic day\
  \ learning about Carlos' life in Boquete.\n\nAt the end of our 5 hour hike, Carlos\
  \ asked if we would like to join him at his house for refreshments.  We didn't hesitate\
  \ to accept his invitation.  We jumped in his Lada Niva and headed up a long, bumpy\
  \ gravel road.  As the valley opened up below us, we were treated to spectacular\
  \ views of the town and surrounding area. When we arrived at Carlos' plantation\
  \ we were in awe of his property.  He had 4 acres, every inch of which was cultivated\
  \ with coffee and bananas.\n\nHe invited us into his simple cottage where we met\
  \ his wife Anna, who welcomed us with a huge hug and kiss on the cheek.  She poured\
  \ us fresh papaya juice and asked if we would like a snack.  Carlos jumped in suggesting\
  \ he teach us how to make patacones.  We had no idea what patacones were, but we\
  \ were excited to find out.  The smashed and fried plantains sprinkled with salt\
  \ were surpisingly delicious! The 4 of us sat out on the veranda eating, drinking\
  \ and laughing as the sun set over the valley.  \n\nAs we said our goodbyes we promised\
  \ to stay in touch and we meant it.  Although we have not had the opportunity to\
  \ go back to Boquete, we have maintained our friendship through email over the years.\
  \  Despite our disappointment that our diving excursion was cancelled, our lifelong\
  \ friendship with Carlos and Anna has more than made up for it!"
