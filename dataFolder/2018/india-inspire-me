Text: "20 strangers greet each other at the airport, exchange trivialities and strap\
  \ in for the 14 hour flight. We're headed to Mumbai, India and we don't really know\
  \ what's in store for us. After a cushy flight and an even cushier stay at hotel\
  \ in Mumbai we're checking out and preparing to meet our tour guide for the trip.\
  \ We're heading to Purushwadi. A rural town where we're to live in tents: without\
  \ electricity, running water or phone coverage. Our families would become the local\
  \ villagers who took us into their homes each meal. The people who dressed us in\
  \ their own clothes so we could better understand the intricate workings of an Indian\
  \ sari. \n\nThis small population of less than 1000 people was barely rocked by\
  \ our presence. If anything, the community accepted us with open arms despite our\
  \ foreign appearance and inability to communicate clearly. We were to spend three\
  \ weeks there, living alongside this community in an attempt to better understand\
  \ a different way of life, on a grassroots level. \n\nOur arrival was warmly welcomed\
  \ by a few villagers who had stayed awake to perform a ceremony for the voyeuristic\
  \ travellers. We were put to bed and awoken early the next morning for our introduction\
  \ to Indian cuisine. It was a form of puffed rice with onion and chilli. This was\
  \ to be breakfast every day for the next three weeks. \n\nFarming, cooking and hiking.\
  \ Through this time we would be accompanied by several tour guides from Mumbai who\
  \ would inevitably become entangled in our lives. One of those people was Vivek.\
  \ He was bright, and full of life, a laugh never far from his lips. Our friendship\
  \ developed hard and fast and we shared a series of experiences together under the\
  \ skies of that small rural town. \n\nOur relationship continued online after I\
  \ returned home to Australia but we never met again after our brief encounter."
