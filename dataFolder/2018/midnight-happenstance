Text: "You could tell we were getting close now. The stifling mid-summer heat was\
  \ now soaked in an essence of a Euro-club dance party. A stark contrast from the\
  \ Bavarian country-side I had spent the last 5 days immersed in with the other athletes\
  \ at the Academy. Inzell was quiet. Home to peaceful farmers and country-folk. It\
  \ reminded me of the sleepy town of Canmore back home. Slow, tranquil. Safe. \n\
  Munich hummed with electricity. Its vibe put me in a trance. The minute we pulled\
  \ in to the station adrenaline coursed through my veins like lightening, quickly\
  \ tracing its way through my body and out my fingertips as I peeled my backpack\
  \ off, now drenched in sweat. I was a bloody athlete for cryin' out loud! I'd come\
  \ out of showers dryer than this. Unbelievable heat, Germany. \nMore like excitement\
  \ of the beautiful madness I was fully immersed in. The adventure had just begun\
  \ as I dragged my ass up the platform steps and into the city's heart, slowly realizing\
  \ with every beat I had no clue where I was in the corn maze of beautiful people\
  \ and this unadulterated Friday night bliss. I took a gulp of the foreign magnificence,\
  \ dropped my backpack by my side and closed my eyes to see it all through. \nArmed\
  \ with a conversational-at-best German tongue and my Canadian charm, I opened my\
  \ eyes and quickly surveyed the streets for possible misadventures. I slung my backpack\
  \ around my shoulders and trekked across a busy pathway before looking back at the\
  \ cityscape; the concrete jungle I had just emerged from.\nBehind me; neon lights,\
  \ the buzz of nightlife and bad decisions. Bustling and chaotic, yet it still held\
  \ a certain expectation of subtle normalcy. While right in front of me lay a dark,\
  \ winding trail to the unknown and uncomfortable. This was the wild. This was something\
  \ I embraced. Something I craved. Comfort was the breeding ground of nothing but\
  \ complacency for who knows how long and I had no desire for that life any longer.\
  \ \nAs familiar to the unknown as I was, even I could have never guessed how that\
  \ summer in Germany would play out. The urban hustle and feverish glow of the city\
  \ quietly succumbed to the moonlight, high in the sky, lighting my way down the\
  \ path to the rest of my life. And the clock ticked. Happenstance at midnight."
