Text: "\u201CWe can make this trip happen!\u201D, was her pitch followed by her relentless\
  \ pep talk to me, an unsure and unconvinced cookie, travelling home in an auto in\
  \ the summer heat on a late Sunday afternoon. It was sometime around mid-May 2016.\
  \ Though it seemed far-fetched, it was not at all hard for me to dream about visiting\
  \ there. After all she was talking about Greece! Long story short, we got our visas\
  \ and we made it to Athens, Greece. \nWe took the metro from Larissa station and\
  \ took us around ten minutes to reach Monastiraki square, the heart of Athens. This\
  \ place was exactly like how we had seen in the pictures and videos; except that\
  \ this time we were actually living them! The square is laid entirely with pretty\
  \ colored tiles. It's a busy spot with cafeterias, restaurants, variety of shops\
  \ and hordes of tourists and locals scattered all around. You get a lovely view\
  \ of the Acropolis from the square. We stopped by Savvas Restaurant to try kebaps\
  \ and shared a large delicious platter of kebaps with pita bread. \nSatisfied with\
  \ kebaps, we then headed to our number one agenda - to get our hands on heart crafted\
  \ sandals from \"The Poet Sandalmaker 2\", the coolest guys in Athens. Coolest because\
  \ they have made sandals to stars like Sophia Loren, Jackline Kennedy, The Beatles\
  \ and many more. In fact, some of the designs are named after them. How cool is\
  \ that!  This vibrant famous shop is tucked away in a street near Monastiraki square.\
  \ This place is art. Walls are decked up with his artwork and of course sorts of\
  \ footwear everywhere. We made our choices - Heraclitus for me and Hermes for my\
  \ friend, Jennifer. Our sizes were readily available. Fortunately, there was a small\
  \ defect with my pair and Pantelis recalled. And then the least expected thing happened\
  \ - Pantelis walked up to me, rising from his work desk, asked me to stand on a\
  \ small bench and he put the sandals to my feet! I quickly motioned my friend to\
  \ take a picture of my biggest moment! I was over the moon! We walked out of the\
  \ store grinning from ear to ear. \nWe made our way to Monastiraki flea market to\
  \ check out antiques. And the first stop we make, I notice that the seller was not\
  \ Greek. Upon asking, he was a Bangladeshi who came all the way from Dhaka, Bangladesh\
  \ over 12 years ago to Greece to do business. And there in that store, thousand\
  \ of miles away, we conversed in Bengali! He even gave me a good bargain too for\
  \ an antique spoon. I returned home content and inspired with a heart full of memories."
