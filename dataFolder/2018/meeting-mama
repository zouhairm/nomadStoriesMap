Text: "El Rosario is your typical small town Baja experience; farming community, welcoming\
  \ smiles, warm hospitality, with one \nmajor difference: their Dona, Mama Anita\
  \ Espinoza is a legend. She began the Flying Samaritans, runs the local orphanage,\
  \ \nmaintains a delightful restaurant and humble hotel, and, she's over 100 years\
  \ old.  \n     We have been passing through El Rosario for years, always making\
  \ a stop at Mama Espinoza's restaurant to grab a bite to eat, or to say hello to\
  \ her daughter, Rolly, who runs the restaurant as Mama gets older, or to other family\
  \ members whom we've come to know over time, and to pass on love and well wishes\
  \ to Mama. We had yet to meet Mama, but had always hoped that one day we would have\
  \ the honor. One lovely afternoon, we stopped to drop off some clothing for the\
  \ orphanage, and to have lunch, when Rolly invited us to meet Mama in the courtyard.\
  \ We were delighted. \n     As we came into the sun drenched yard behind the cafe,\
  \ there was Mama in her favorite chair, a blanket over her shoulders, swaying her\
  \ head to the music she was listening to on her headphones, crocheting a scarf of\
  \ brilliant shades of the rainbow. She smiled at us approaching, her soft skin puckering\
  \ around her mouth and deep brown eyes, welcoming us as if we were dear friends.\
  \ We introduced ourselves, told her what an honor it was to finally meet her, and\
  \ she laughed. \"I'm just an old lady.\" She insisted, \"But I can tell you a story\
  \ or two.\" She proceeded to tell us her life story, from birth to her travels by\
  \ covered wagon to Mexicali to go to school to learn English, to her founding the\
  \ Flying Samaritans, her restaurant being a checkpoint for the Baja 500 and 1000,\
  \ and the Presidential visit when the road was paved through, when he borrowed an\
  \ enormous Ammonite to display in the Presidential palace that he never returned.\
  \ She spoke sadly of the changes she had seen in her long life, and smiled wistfully\
  \ with hopes for the future generations of her country. My husband asked her many\
  \ questions in his broken Spanish, to which she chided him, \"You know, I speak\
  \ perfect English,\" and we all laughed almost to the point of tears. Her English\
  \ was impeccable, as was her memory of over 100 years of adventures. As our visit\
  \ wound down, my husband asked her, \"Mama, what is the secret to your long life?\"\
  \ She replied simply, \"All I need is my beans, my rice, and my sunshine.\" Profoundly\
  \ simple, and the perfect motto for my family, as we continue our own 100+ year\
  \ journey."
