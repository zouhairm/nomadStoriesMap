Text: "One more hour has passed since we started trekking. The terrain was wet, because\
  \ of the raining season. Just yesterday there was a rain. Today it isn\u2019t much\
  \ better: foggy and cloudy. Taking into account the place where I am, I wish weather\
  \ was sunny. Only sunny weather conditions would suit the Sa Pa region of Vietnam\
  \ the best! \nA bit tired but need to continue going through the rice fields.  They\
  \ are beautiful. \nMy feet, sneakers and socks are stained by wet soil. I feel a\
  \ bit cold, as I only wear shorts and T-shirt. I am with a group of people whom\
  \ I have never met before this trip. Germans, French guy (who was on his 3rd year\
  \ of traveling), Italians. Don\u2019t remember other folks. As we do not know how\
  \ to go and where to go, we are accompanied by the local people: ethnic minority\
  \ living in Vietnam that is called the Black Hmong. They take us by hands, ensure\
  \ we will be safe, because the terrain is not plain, but mountainous and there is\
  \ a risk to fall down. These people as I remembered do not speak English, even if\
  \ they do, very limitedly. Just very common phrases needed to communicate with tourists.\
  \ They wear their traditional clothes, which I had not seen during the rest of my\
  \ 50 days\u2019 time in many parts of Vietnam from the South to the North. They\
  \ can do these tours every day and often they do. While we were tired, they already\
  \ got used to it. \nAt one moment we made one of breaks. Among local people who\
  \ guided us there was one elderly woman. Hat on her head, blue shabby boots and\
  \ big earrings caught my eye. I approached her and made a sign indicating \u201C\
  may I take picture with you?\u201D She nodded her head. I gave my camera to one\
  \ of the tourists to take photo of us. Her face was emotionless. She is may be above\
  \ 60, who does this tour probably very often and apparently most of her life. Looking\
  \ at her, her eyes you see and feel another world, where system of values, way of\
  \ living differs from ours, although some definitely coincide.  It is possible that\
  \ she and rest of people guiding us probably have never traveled outside their areas,\
  \ not speaking about travel to another country. This is their world, where their\
  \ ancestors had apparently almost the same living standards as their descendants.\
  \ And the next generation of people guiding us will probably have the same life\
  \ too. We did not speak to them because, as above mentioned they barely speak English,\
  \ but looking in the eyes of this woman I had this thought. I made a local connection\
  \ with her world."
