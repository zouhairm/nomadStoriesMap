Text: "I live in the northern suburbs of Cape Town; well it is sort of the edge of\
  \ the City of Cape Town.\nMy school career has been rather odd, the first school\
  \ I went to was Holy Cross Sisters\u2019 School in Bellville. A catholic school\
  \ which held up to all the values and the teaching was up to standard.  Life in\
  \ that community, where everyone is privileged was a ball if I must say. There were\
  \ the black sheep but they were not treated any differently. \nOnce I finished grade\
  \ 7 there I started a whole new chapter in my life, going to school in Kraaifontein.\
  \ The place I know like the back of my hand now. Many things happened throughout\
  \ high school. My first year I must say was demanding and devastating. I learnt\
  \ that being sheltered from all the horrible people in primary school was a really\
  \ bad thing. I realised I was privileged to have my mother take and fetch me from\
  \ school each day. \nHowever, this changed once I started my tertiary education\
  \ in the city centre which is at least an hour away from where I live. I began taking\
  \ the train with my father in the mornings and made some friends who would be on\
  \ the same train as me. We made a habit of travelling together in the afternoons\
  \ for our own safety.\nI think my first time I went in to class I believed that\
  \ this, the train stopping, is a normal thing. Clearly I was mistaken, it was normal\
  \ that the train stopped between Thornton Station and Mutual Station but to me it\
  \ was all brand new. It was stepping out of my comfort zone to understand why people\
  \ always complain about the trains each day. I must say it is exhausting.\nThe first\
  \ time I ever experienced a major delay was the day I stood waiting for a train\
  \ at Brackenfell Station for almost 3 hours and I was there just after 6 in the\
  \ morning. I must confess that this right here was my nightmare; I had never been\
  \ late for a class until that cold, wintery day. Arriving to campus to have missed\
  \ my first class was disappointing, but I made a friend that day. He on the other\
  \ hand got the worst end of the stick which was unfortunate.\nTrains in Cape Town\
  \ are nightmare but along the way I learnt a few things, there are many ways to\
  \ get to town in the morning. So I have gone the back route via Stellenbosch a few\
  \ times just to get to class on time. My local connection was finding out that everywhere\
  \ you go things happen no matter what the circumstances are and you make friends\
  \ with people who are in the same situations.\nYou realise that everyone struggles\
  \ with the same problems."
