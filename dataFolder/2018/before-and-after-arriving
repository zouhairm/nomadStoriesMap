Text: "Before and after arriving, that\u2019s how life could be defined when the immigration\
  \ between skies becomes real. When precise people and places, costumes and landmarks\
  \ made you realize that the loudest noise doesn\u2019t come from the languages you\
  \ may don\u2019t understand, but from the music that comes out of their habits.\
  \  \nThere is a place where as soon as your body enters into a rooted airport, train\
  \ station, bus or empty road the movement among birds and species can be measured\
  \ at a different velocity, an unusual temperature. That division between lives and\
  \ skies holds a rumor towards warning and counseling signs: the rumor of being curiously\
  \ surprised by the similarity of analogous minds.\nLast year I left a first and\
  \ unique love behind -an immense mountain with unsullied air and memories long ago\
  \ extinct- and I arrived at a fairytale with villains where winter and the chillness\
  \ of the Nordic blood were my cautionary sign. That first say I saw the sky, I noticed\
  \ the lights, the low roofs, the quietness and yet voluble spirit of the city and\
  \ I woke up without macaws and sun-drenched mornings. After 13 hours in a plane\
  \ flying from one continent to another, and being the first time leaving my country\
  \ in more than 8 years, the last thing I expected was to notice another absence\
  \ that was not his with so much wistfulness. \nIn Berlin, everybody was free and\
  \ self-sufficient. The rhythm of footsteps in the streets was one stating \u2018\
  I am not trying to be anybody else but me\u2019 and an \u2018I\u2019m not sure where\
  \ are you from but it doesn\u2019t really matter\u2019 smile. The radio of nationalities\
  \ and languages was as wide as the library I left with mourning in Caracas. The\
  \ air was unsullied and delightfully cold; independence was one fleeting term to\
  \ describe the feeling of walking in its genially senseless architecture.\nPassing\
  \ through an immense piece of history where destruction and pain remembered the\
  \ obvious in history books, the city endured as a benevolent space where you could\
  \ miss the sun but never the pleasure of being who you wanted to be, dress or vibrate.\
  \ \nI\u2019ve been in different places since then, Europe at its core: Milano and\
  \ its elegant streets and ladies, Switzerland and its breathtaking landscapes, Tenerife\
  \ and its eternal summer air. Every time I miss here like I first missed the macaws\
  \ and the sun-drenched mornings of Caracas that first dawn. In this crave there\
  \ is the unexpected, the \u2018I found myself in a place where I can state that\
  \ another sky feels like home\u2019 awareness."
