Text: "\u201CYou\u2019re going to Quito? On your own? I was there with my husband,\
  \ he walked from the hotel to the supermarket and was mugged at knifepoint!\u201D\
  , \u201COh yes, Ecuador\u2019s a very dangerous place \u2013 you should take a taxi\
  \ everywhere\u201D. Lying in a hammock above the pristine white Nicaraguan sand,\
  \ this lawless place I was hearing about seemed a million miles away and yet the\
  \ next day I would be in the middle of it \u2026\n\nIt was with some trepidation\
  \ I stepped off the plane and warily made my way to Arrivals. Turning a corner,\
  \ the snow-capped Andean mountains took my breath away as they came into view and\
  \ I became excited at the thought of spending the next few days exploring the area.\n\
  \nA visit to the Equator was a must, and armed with some scribbled directions from\
  \ the friendly guesthouse receptionist I found the right bus and successfully negotiated\
  \ my way to the next. I squashed in with the crowd; families excitedly talking nineteen\
  \ to the dozen and teenagers giving up their seats for senior citizens. This didn\u2019\
  t appear to be the dangerous place I\u2019d envisaged. Reaching the end of the line\
  \ I hadn\u2019t a clue what to do next, my notes had petered out and we clearly\
  \ weren\u2019t at \u2018Mitad del Mundo\u2019.\n\nBrandishing my scrap of paper\
  \ the locals at the busy bus station were slightly bemused to find a non-Spanish-speaking\
  \ foreigner in their midst, however after some discussion I was directed to a bus\
  \ that was just about to leave. As we pulled out of the station I handed over some\
  \ change to the conductor and hopefully asked: \u201CMitad del Mundo?\u201D. \u201C\
  No\u201D he said, apologetically, as he gave me a ticket.\n\n\u201CThere\u2019s\
  \ a connecting bus\u201D. Starting to wonder where exactly I was heading I was relieved\
  \ to hear this from the passenger sitting next to me.  Keen to practice her English,\
  \ we shared an enjoyable journey to the next bus station where she kindly walked\
  \ me to the right stop before fondly waving goodbye.\n\n\u201CMitad del Mundo?\u201D\
  \ I asked the driver as I boarded what I hoped was my final bus. \u201CSi!\u201D\
  \ he said. As I settled down for the final leg a man politely introduced himself,\
  \ and with the help of my phrasebook I shared some of my travel stories and he shared\
  \ his hopes to someday travel and have adventures of his own.\n\nAs I sat on the\
  \ first of the four buses back to the city I watched the sun setting over the mountains\
  \ and felt touched by the kindness of the strangers I had encountered.  I reflected\
  \ that it was not the destination that had fulfilled me that day, but the journey\
  \ I experienced to reach it."
