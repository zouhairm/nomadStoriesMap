Text: "It\u2019s 5:30pm and I\u2019m leaving the office I came in 10 hours ago. Walking\
  \ on the inexistent sidewalk on my way to the bus stop I can\u2019t help thinking\
  \ why I'm here. I stand there waiting, wondering if I made the right decision. A\
  \ taxi is coming to pick me up, I can\u2019t stand anymore, in every sense of the\
  \ word. I still have work to do, but my mind is broken.\nDay 3. I start putting\
  \ my best clothes on, because I already know I won\u2019t come back tomorrow. I\
  \ arrive to the office and everything looks normal on the outside, while everything\
  \ is different inside. With every minute I spend in my chair listening to the managers,\
  \ I am more convinced that I don\u2019t want to belong here anymore. After a lost\
  \ last chance, I go to my manager and I let my speech fly. \u201CI won\u2019t work\
  \ more than 8 hours, especially, when they are unpaid\u201D, \u201CI won\u2019t\
  \ depersonalize my LinkedIn\u201D, \u201Cmoney was never the main reason I came\
  \ here\u201D. I took my things with my head high and left behind the nightmare I\
  \ was living in.\nThree days before I started a course in Malta to work in the world\u2019\
  s largest independent financial consultancy. The new year meant for me a new job,\
  \ new country, new life. My colleagues might think I was the youngest, the weakest,\
  \ the least experienced and I ended up being the smartest, the strongest and, probably,\
  \ the most honest, because I was not sacrificing personal ethics for a work reason.\
  \ Most of them were money-driven, but there\u2019s something money can\u2019t buy:\
  \ TIME. \u201CHey time, long time no see you\u201D.\nNevertheless, I found an ocean\
  \ of uncertainty in front of me. Should I look for a job? A master? A life?\nFinally,\
  \ I decided to stay. Every corner of these islands was new for me and I had all\
  \ the time of the world to discover them. Popeye\u2019s Village, the Blue Grotto\
  \ or the once standing Azure Window were in my route and being far from stress,\
  \ obligations and pressure, I started to dream again. My new year\u2019s resolutions\
  \ always include some objectives of my bucket list. However, I had a big dream never\
  \ implemented before and it was exactly the right time and the right moment. Emma\
  \ Watson\u2019s words moved around in my head: \u201CIf not me, who? If not now,\
  \ when?\u201D.\nThen I started to build my dream. A part of me shared with the world.\
  \ My travel blog finally on air. Inspiration, freedom, purpose. Joy, excitement,\
  \ adrenaline. Fulfilling feelings that triggered my passion for travelling and writing.\
  \ A nightmare that turned into a dream and became my life. Because dreams are dreams\
  \ until you make them real."
