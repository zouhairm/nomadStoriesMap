Text: "\u201CAlhamdulillah\u201D. Fatima smiles, a broad, genuine grin, in sharp contrast\
  \ to the story she has just told. I am in Fatima\u2019s front room halfway down\
  \ the fortified hill at Ait Benhaddou in Morocco. Outside the sun is murderous.\
  \ Donkeys stand in the heat, motionless, obedient, eyes half shut. This morning\
  \ it had rained. Hard. So hard, it turned all the tiny streams that wind their way\
  \ down the hill into gushing rivers of coffee-coloured water. \u201COued\u201D,\
  \ Fatima corrects me. \u201CNot river. Oued can be sometimes dry. A river, it is\
  \ never dry\u2026\u201D much like Fatima\u2019s courage I am soon to learn.\nFatima\
  \ had caught me on my way up. \u201CWhen you come back, I will make you henna. I\
  \ will have tea\u201D. I thanked her and left with promises that I would visit on\
  \ my return not really expecting her to be standing in the same dark doorway and\
  \ certain I would not remember which house was hers in the meandering, narrow maze\
  \ of burnt-orange, earthen dwellings that climbed up from the river (the real one).\
  \ But she was there, hours later, running up to me like a long-lost friend and ushering\
  \ me through sparse rooms and faint whiffs of maghrebi tea into the cool inside.\n\
  Not an inch of floor was left unadorned by intricate, woven Berber rugs. Even more\
  \ were stacked high in every corner. Vibrant greens, blues, pinks. Bold block designs\
  \ and geometric shapes. Fatima pulls up two tiny wooden stools and starts preparing\
  \ the henna paste. She gently holds my hand with her thick, work-worn fingers as\
  \ the needleless syringe weaves the strong liquid in delicate patterns from my wrist\
  \ to my fingertips.\nAt first glance, huddled in the half-light, hair bound tightly\
  \ in a knotted scarf, I had guessed her to be perhaps 60, but she had a sparkle\
  \ that suggested a woman much younger. Fatima was telling her story. A mother of\
  \ 7, her husband had divorced her, leaving her to fend for herself and all 7 children.\
  \ With no money, never a chance for education, she could only weave her rugs and\
  \ offer tea to the tourists who climbed here every day. Past her small front room.\
  \ Past her village. The kindness of strangers. \nI look at her with a sad appreciation\
  \ of her struggle. A mist creeps across her eyes and, for a moment, softens the\
  \ perma-smile lines she has worked so hard to etch into her face. With a self-deprecating\
  \ laugh she waves her hand dismissively, shooing bad memories away. \u201CAlhamdulillah\u201D\
  , she smiles, peacefully. \u201CI am happy. I thank God every day for what I have.\
  \ Alhamdulillah\u201D.\nThat day, I bought a lot of rugs."
