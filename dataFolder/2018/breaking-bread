Text: "To immerse yourself and become part of someone's 'everyday' is what brings\
  \ travelling to life. To engage with a local person can give you a sense of belonging\
  \ and awaken your senses to more than just the typical holiday experience. \nKyrgyzstan,\
  \ a country that is hard enough to say let along spell! Prior to my visit I knew\
  \ nothing about this place. Now I remember it fondly because of the generous Kyrgyz\
  \ hospitality. \nWalking past a farmhouse in the rain turned into something completely\
  \ unexpected with an invitation to take shelter. We walked into a cosy room, the\
  \ warmth from the fire, fresh bread cooking, the floor covered with multi-coloured\
  \ rugs and scatter cushions with smiling welcoming faces both young and old eager\
  \ to get to know these visitors entering their home. \nWatching grandma put the\
  \ fresh dough balls onto the hotplate made my stomach forget that we had not long\
  \ eaten our very ordinary sandwich. There is nothing better than fresh warm bread\
  \ served with jam to make someone feel right at home. We were literally \u2018breaking\
  \ bread\u2019 together; stranger\u2019s comfortable in each other\u2019s company.\n\
  With the bread we were offered a beverage to wash it down. We knew what was coming.\
  \ We had been given prior warning by our tour guides that it would be offered to\
  \ us if we were to visit anyone in their home and how it was impolite to refuse.\n\
  Yak\u2019s milk! Best described as an acquired taste. \nMyself and Christine are\
  \ not big milk drinkers. Dave on the other hand loves it.\nWithout a word spoken\
  \ between us we knew what needed to be done. Our quick glances to each other said\
  \ it all, how this was going to play out so we did not offend our beautiful hosts.\n\
  As three large mugs were filled to the brim with yak\u2019s milk and handed to us\
  \ we prepared ourselves for the tasting. Christine and I politely took a sip as\
  \ Dave necked his mugful and discreetly swapped cups with us both, again draining\
  \ the milk in a couple of big gulps. Full respect to Dave for taking one for the\
  \ Team! At the same time we had to ensure that our hosts didn\u2019t take Dave\u2019\
  s quick drinking as a sign he wanted more! After three mugs of Yak\u2019s milk he\
  \ was definitely full to the brim and in need of saving.\nThroughout our milk ordeal\
  \ we connected with this beautiful family finding out about their life, playing\
  \ with the children and exchanging email addresses to keep in touch.\nWe left knowing\
  \ that this experience had enhanced our travel adventure and whole heartedly laughed\
  \ as we recalled Dave\u2019s milk swigging efforts."
