Text: "I gaze into the shrewd brown eyes of my opponent as a grin begins to spread\
  \ across his face. \nTwo rows of three cards lay before us, dimly lit against the\
  \ rusted iron sheeting and coarse canvas drapes that form the top floor of our living\
  \ quarters. Over two days this three-storied cargo ship has carried us along the\
  \ stretch of the Amazon River from Leticia, Colombia's Southernmost city to Peru's\
  \ Ayahuasca capital, Iquitos.\n\nSilhouettes of lightly garbed crew members and\
  \ locals sweat around us, whispering in a mixture of Spanish and their indigenous\
  \ tongues. The glow of cigarettes flicker across their leathery, weather-beaten\
  \ faces bearing expressions of the most intense curiosity. I run my hand through\
  \ my overgrown hair, greasy from a lack of washing and days spent sweating in the\
  \ Amazonian heat. With every passing moment the gentle hum of the ships diesel engine\
  \ draws us nearer and nearer to our final destination. \n\nThis is it, I think to\
  \ myself. The little bastard has got me.\n\nHe'd found me alone and somewhat inebriated\
  \ from a bottle of rum (Ron as the locals call it) purchased from a shanty town\
  \ on the banks of the river. Slumped to the floor, hammock in a knotted mess, the\
  \ boy had looked at me almost pitiful before giggling to himself and calling out\
  \ \"Papa\". From across the deck, a chubby older fellow with no shirt and flip flops\
  \ had waddled over, introduced himself as Julio and set my hammock from the ferry's\
  \ roof. \n\"Muchos gracias senior\" I slurred, offering my Ron. A shake of the head\
  \ and a wry smile and he was back to his own hammock.\n\nI'd looked over at my scrawny\
  \ saviour and motioned for him to sit opposite me. Curiously, he obliged as he was\
  \ presented a set of tattered cards. The next two days were spent gazing out over\
  \ floating debris and banks lined with rainforest, teaching a ten year old to play\
  \ the backpackers game, karma. I spoke little of his language, he even less of mine.\
  \ I was travelling the Amazon for leisure, he and his father out of necessity. I\
  \ was double his age and knew relatively nothing about him. And yet, here we sat.\
  \ Two boys, from opposite ends of the world playing cards like old friends. \n\n\
  The horn of our cargo ship sounds, signalling our arrival to the smoggy port of\
  \ Iquitos.\nI play my hand and he plays his as the crowd around us dissipates. \n\
  I'm bested.\nWe shake hands, I wink at him and he runs off to meet his father.\n\
  I smile to myself as I see that the heart of the Amazon lies in its people. For\
  \ me, it was a boy I couldn't speak to."
