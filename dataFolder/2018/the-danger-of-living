Text: "That's when it hit us - the reason why Sherpas are calling high peak mountains\
  \ - the place where the gods live.\nIt was breath-taking. Literally. Lightheaded,\
  \ from the rarefied air, we saw the primal, raw beauty of the infamous Ama Dablam.\
  \ Our hearts exploded like popcorn kernels. \n \nIt was day 7 of our Himalayas hike\
  \ and we were living a dizzying visual adventure. We stopped for lunch, a bowl of\
  \ soup with handfuls of chopped garlic, both medicine and food. It's Sherpa's natural\
  \ remedy for acute mountain sickness, so we had to make friends with it.\n\nA couple,\
  \ next to us, consoled us with the promise of the best apple pie awaiting us on\
  \ the top. The exhaustion of the hike, the weakness from the lack of oxygen and\
  \ a stomach in delirium after having garlic soup for days weren't promising for\
  \ getting the \"ultimate apple pie\". We made peace with not reaching all the way\
  \ up.\n\nSynchronized with the mountains, we were listening to Om Mani Padme Hum,\
  \ a mantra that sends vibrations down to your sou. It  follows you through all the\
  \ Buddhist villages as an invisible guardian.\n \nMountains have a way to uncover\
  \ your weaknesses and teach you what you need to learn. Our lesson was humbleness.\
  \ We no longer aimed to brag about having seen Mt.Everest.\nAs we sat there, we\
  \ wondered how many hikers had gone through the same path, soaked up their soul\
  \ in the adrenaline of crossing suspension bridges over fast running rivers or admired\
  \ bleeding sunsets, punctured by mountain peaks.\nHiking a trail in Himalayas is\
  \ a celebration of human possibility and a lesson in humility. Not everyone who\
  \ couldn't wait to share those precious moments with their friends or family\u2026\
  got back. You could feel their souls in the morning mist. \nWhat happens to their\
  \ stories? How are they remembered? How close did they come to living? \n \nAs the\
  \ evening unfolded, we arrived to the guest house in Gokyo. Tomorrow we will hike\
  \ to Gokyo Ri to conclude our goal of reaching the top, at 5,357m. Yet, it wasn't\
  \ any more about crossing it off the bucket list. It was about sharing the grand\
  \ beauty of the mountains between us and the friendships we built along the way.\n\
  Listening to Sherpa stories and all those that ventured to summit Mt. Everest, we\
  \ realized that there is something bigger than us, a higher meaning to life and\
  \ that travelling is the answer to the quest of finding what that is.\nAnd as we\
  \ took a bite of the best apple pie on the planet, that arrived after 1h and 47\
  \ minutes, we started to plan the Kilimanjaro hike."
