Text: "We couldn\u2019t have left it there. It would\u2019ve meant that we had giving\
  \ up our most valuable possession. Although it got darker as the time went by and\
  \ the tide was slowly coming in, we clung to the last gleam of hope.\nAll we wanted\
  \ was to detour around the flooded street. By now our car No. 7 got stuck with all\
  \ its four tires in the hard, clayey soil of a lake bounded by mangrove trees. The\
  \ surface of the lake reminded me of a thick crocodilian amor. No. 7 was trapped\
  \ in its jaws. \nWe cursed the wet season in the Northern Territory of Australia\
  \ and that our car was the only one without a snorkel. Every other car of the convoy\
  \ drove through the newly formed river. Only we couldn\u2019t. However, we were\
  \ lucky that we weren\u2019t on our own but had nine off-road vehicles with two\
  \ dozens of other thrillseekers with us.\nWith ruffled hair and naked feet everyone\
  \ hopped out of their cars to give No. 7 a hand, a shovel and other tools. \nWe\
  \ pushed and shoved, wobbled and jiggled the car from all sides, but in vain. Instead\
  \ the tread pattern burrowed deeper into the clay so that the car body was bottomed\
  \ out on the lake like a grounded shipwreck. But we wouldn't abandon No. 7, our\
  \ home.\nThe rescue mission was in full swing as the sun moved towards the horizon.\
  \ For over three hours we're trying to clear the tires from the intractable mud\
  \ which was hiding underneath the dried crust. One of our many straps ripped while\
  \ we tried with the help of car No. 10 to pull No. 7 out of the lake. It didn\u2019\
  t move.\nI was standing waist-deep in the sludge my whole body covered with dirt\
  \ as I started to loose hope. The humid heat made us sweat and the dirt on our skin\
  \ began to itch. The sky got darker and there was something we hadn\u2019t realized\
  \ till now: The dried-out lake was nothing else but a small mouth of the ocean.\
  \ With the dawn the tides changed and the mouth slowly filled up with water. We\
  \ had to keep calm and act fast. \nEvery hand was needed for digging, mounting straps\
  \ to the other cars and tensioning an electrical winch from car No. 1 to 7. That\
  \ was the last chance nature gave us before the car would turn into a shipwreck\
  \ for good. We clung fast to the last gleam of hope and the car finally escaped\
  \ its fate. We all started crying and laughing with relief and the tension eased.\n\
  Being completely cut off from the outside world and at the nature\u2019s mercy I\
  \ realized I was happy that it happened. \nIn the end it brought us closer together\
  \ and we're even more thrilled about our next adventure."
