Text: "I stood in the stone-lined, recessed square hollow in the ground that marked\
  \ an ancient fire temple dedicated to the Celtic goddess Brigid, clasping hands\
  \ with those to my right and left. The afternoon's brisk air settled quietly around\
  \ us.\n\nOur day had been a whirlwind of learning and experiences, from visiting\
  \ sacred shrines and wells dedicated to St. Brigid and the goddess to learning about\
  \ the conflation of the two figures over a meal inspired by traditional foods to\
  \ lighting candles from a sacred flame. We wandered from Co. Louth to Co. Meath,\
  \ from Co. Clare to Co. Kildare, following in the footsteps of the saint and all\
  \ the while also learning the lore associated with the goddess. \n\nAt St. Brigid\u2019\
  s Cathedral, we met Gemma McGowan, a pagan priestess and our guide through a ceremony\
  \ to honor the goddess Brigid. She took us behind the cathedral to the fire temple,\
  \ where she sang a call to the eight deities of her pantheon, and we descended into\
  \ stone square. \n \nWe lined the edges of the fire temple, hands linked, while\
  \ Gemma stood in the center. In one hand she held a tall lantern made of white-painted\
  \ metal and glass that contained an ivory pillar candle lit from the Brigid's eternal\
  \ flame. In her other, she held St. Brigid\u2019s Cross--a four-pointed star woven\
  \ from reeds.\n\nShe said she\u2019d like to offer us Brigid\u2019s blessing, if\
  \ we didn\u2019t mind, telling us that of course we were free to say no. I almost\
  \ did. My faith is not hers, and part of me wanted to recoil from the strangeness\
  \ of it all.\n\nBut we don\u2019t travel to stay comfortable. We travel to expand\
  \ our horizons, to learn about the world, to see things through others\u2019 eyes,\
  \ if we can. \n\nSo when Gemma approached me, I nodded. \n\nShe lifted the lantern\
  \ level with my head, then lowered it to swing near my feet.\n\n\u201CMay there\
  \ be fire in your heart.\u201D The cross touched my chest. \u201CMay there be fire\
  \ in your belly.\u201D The cross touched my abdomen. \u201CMay there be fire in\
  \ your mind.\u201D The cross touched my forehead. \n\nGemma blew on the woven cross\
  \ between each touch, smiling beatifically.\n\nShe moved around the circle, offering\
  \ her blessing to each who would accept it. Her voice held a conviction that spoke\
  \ of utter belief. \n\nWe left the temple, trekking to another sacred well as the\
  \ twilight gloaming dimmed the sky, and I was left to mull over my mind's questions.\n\
  \nHer faith may not be mine, but I've no doubt that she has one. It guides her actions\
  \ just as mine does. And in that quiet dusk's air, this glimpse was enough."
