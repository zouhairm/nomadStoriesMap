Text: "The man is staring intently at her, but she can\u2019t meet his eyes.  Sinking\
  \ in to her seat she takes a nervous sip of her drink, the fiery alcohol drenching\
  \ the butterflies dancing in her stomach as she glances at the ring again. Could\
  \ she?\n\nQuashing nerves and sense in one movement she nods her assent and stands,\
  \ blushing, as those around her roar their approval. The man is grinning as he pulls\
  \ her away from the crowd for some privacy.  \n\n'Change quickly, he says, thrusting\
  \ a bundle at her, you\u2019ve fought before, chai'?  'Mai chai' she mutters. Oblivious\
  \ to the man\u2019s incredulous expression she pulls her dress off in one fluid\
  \ movement and yanks on the baggy shorts. The lights are blinding as she walks back\
  \ out in to the sticky, malevolent heat and, fighting the urge to run as quickly\
  \ as possible from the man and the boozy, braying crowd, she ducks under the ropes\
  \ and taps gloves with her opponent. \n\nThe attack comes as a flurry of blows;\
  \ fists, elbows and shins batter her body as she attempts to twist away from the\
  \ arachnid monster she is locked in battle with. 'They go for the eyebrows' a punter\
  \ had slurred at her earlier. She'd baulked at his sour, smoky breath but he'd leaned\
  \ in closer anyway 'the more blood, the less they can see', and she\u2019d wondered\
  \ then what that would feel like.  Ruby red rivers, stinging her eyes and meandering\
  \ down her face like trails of tribal war paint.  \n\nThey break. Exhausted just\
  \ from standing upright she slumps in her corner. The thought that she is going\
  \ to lose taunts her and she can see the man talking to someone, shooting worried\
  \ stares in her direction as he speaks. \n\nDing.\n\nThis time she is more prepared\
  \ for the onslaught, and the odd throw makes contact as she starts to step in time\
  \ to the wild, brutal dance. 'Don\u2019t go down 'is her internal mantra 'whatever\
  \ happens just don\u2019t go down'. Her lungs are burning but something in her has\
  \ snapped and the crowd, sensing the difference ripples and writhes with electric\
  \ expectation\u2026 \n\nDing.\n\nThe final round is faster as the eerie squall of\
  \ the Sarama binds them in a frenetic web of notes.  Her opponent kicks her, hard,\
  \ and everything goes white.  She retaliates letting instinct take over.  \n\nSuddenly\
  \ it\u2019s over, and the noise of the room rushes back over her like a wave. Someone\
  \ is holding her arm up and the man is back with a different look in his eyes. 'Korp\
  \ khun k\xE2' she thanks him as she leaves. 'Kr\xE1p he responds, quietly, smiling,\
  \ nak muay farang'."
