Text: "Having worked for 2 years in a dead end IT support job takes a lot out of you\
  \ and brings in the need of a vacation at least once in few months to break out\
  \ of the mundane routine life. This story is one such expedition i embarked upon\
  \ recently.\nI had got an interview call from an MBA college in Pune. Although me\
  \ joining was a doubtful case, i decided to go ahead for the sake of experience\
  \ and the travel that i would be part of. So i made up a plan to extend few days\
  \ and travel around. I was alone, travelling to and fro although i had a cousin\
  \ and a friend who accompanied me for brief periods. I decided to ditch the more\
  \ preferred flight and chose train for the journey. Train journeys in India surely\
  \ is a must experience which i see even foreigners try when they are here. it gives\
  \ us a perfect picture of India depicting various cultures and diversity in terms\
  \ of living. it was great talking to strangers, sharing experiences and life stories\
  \ with each other and debating over the country's issues. The journey was long enough\
  \ to get to know each other and i had made couple of good friends too. I explored\
  \ the local culture, food and touched upon worldly matters that were not significantly\
  \ visible back in Bangalore like poverty that haunted Mumbai despite it being the\
  \ richest city of India. I realized we have a long way to go before India becomes\
  \ a developed nation. \n\nI visited few historical places, beaches, a hill station\
  \ and also an island off Mumbai which was marked with amazing birds all through\
  \ the way which never hesitated to eat off our hands. This was the closest i had\
  \ ever gotten with a bird. another takeaway from this experience was the friends\
  \ i made, random and spontaneous, including a couple of foreigners i accompanied\
  \ as a local guide. I stayed in youth hostels which brought out the extrovert in\
  \ me. I had a great time playing games with them. Finally the best moment of the\
  \ trip was when a group of strangers made through a tough trek to reach the pinnacle.\
  \ There was a point which we felt almost impossible but thanks to the teamwork coming\
  \ off from total strangers that helped us achieve the feat. this was a wonderful\
  \ moment as i had set out alone for this trek and god knows what would have happened\
  \ if these strangers were not there for my help, for our help. i am really thankful\
  \ to them who considered me as my friend and saw me along all the way till the end."
