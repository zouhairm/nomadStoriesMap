Text: "The sun had set when the van dropped me off in front of a rock-formed hotel\
  \ in Goreme, Cappadocia. After a day of touring nearby sights, all I wanted to do\
  \ was take a shower and run to a nearby restaurant for a bite to eat. I barely spent\
  \ any time in the room, let alone figure my way around the hotel and went to the\
  \ front desk for a recommendation.\n\nThis young man close to my age looked at me\
  \ and said there\u2019s only three places that are still open. It was a Saturday\
  \ night. \u201CI can drive you over.\u201D For someone who lives in New York City\
  \ and completely self-sufficient, I didn\u2019t want to be a nuisance and politely\
  \ declined. I took the 10-minute walk over to a well-lit plaza and found myself\
  \ in the middle of travelers, relaxing and mingling with our limited ability to\
  \ communicate in whatever common language possible.\n\nTurkey had been a country\
  \ I\u2019ve wanted to visit because of its rich history, culture, and sights, yet\
  \ I knew nothing about this part of the world aside from the photos I\u2019ve seen.\
  \ I was quite cautious during the first few days of travel as this was my first\
  \ solo trip. Breaking out of a close-knit group of friends, doing what I wanted\
  \ to without having to consult anyone. It was nerve-wracking, but I found my pace\
  \ started to ease and my walls gradually came down. I started to accept invitations\
  \ to go and sit for a cup of tea. Chat with the merchants selling whatever they\
  \ can to tourists. Sat back without worrying about the fact that I was traveling\
  \ alone. I found myself reaching out to other introverted solo-travelers like myself,\
  \ because I realized I wanted someone to reach out to me when I was too afraid to\
  \ make that gesture. I longed to be asked to tell my story, why I was there, where\
  \ I am from, and what my dreams were.\n\nAs I sat in the restaurant immersed in\
  \ my thoughts, reflecting on my day in Cappadocia and reveled at this adventurous\
  \ side of myself, I was approached by a local man who was hoping to gather a few\
  \ customers for the next week. Conversations and numbers were exchanged amongst\
  \ the group, then this tour guide left. About half hour later, the young man at\
  \ the hotel walked in to the restaurant looking for me to make sure I was ok. I\
  \ was confused, shocked yet delightfully surprised by this gesture, and I asked\
  \ why he had come?\n\nSomeone was waiting in a car outside the hotel and I hadn\u2019\
  t been back yet. I checked my phone for time and saw a text from the tour guide\
  \ who had left with a message, \u201CI\u2019m waiting in front of your hotel. Come\
  \ out.\u201D"
