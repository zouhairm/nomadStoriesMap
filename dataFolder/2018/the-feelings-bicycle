Text: "With trembling moves and a lot of hesitations, he decided to let his anxiety\
  \ goes and start a conversation with me. (It was almost a 4 hours\u2019 flight from\
  \ Turkey to Amsterdam), a sudden decision that I took without considering any of\
  \ the consequences and the outcomes, I was at my peak when I left my country, mostly\
  \ broke and on the edge of leaving my job\u201D. His first question to break the\
  \ Ice was \u201Cwhere are you from?\u201D, and since there was a lot that is running\
  \ in my mind, my answer was as simple as one word \u201CEgypt\u201D. Few moments\
  \ of silence passed and came up another question \u201Cwhat are you doing in the\
  \ Netherlands? are you studying?\u201D that question provoked me to talk because\
  \ it struck my genuine thoughts about my future and I also felt that I need to talk\
  \ before my confused feelings do the talk. The conversation went on, getting to\
  \ know that he is from India and because of my intense interest in the country his\
  \ mouth was wide open of surprise while saying \u201Coh you are more Indian than\
  \ me\u201D and even more surprised when he knew that I am only in Amsterdam for\
  \ three hours as a transit before taking my bus to Berlin. With an open heart, he\
  \ offered to take my luggage for that three hours and to lend one of the most famous\
  \ transportation to roam around the city of Amsterdam \u201Ca bicycle\u201D. My\
  \ head felt lighter and the worries of the future ran away to a hidden place. The\
  \ soul of mine roamed the city on its miraculous bicycle, enjoying the air mixed\
  \ with tasty smells of delicious food, that later was combined with the smell of\
  \ weed. My eyes enjoyed the streets full of young people and tourists wandering\
  \ around, mostly without aim, suddenly he said \u201Ccome I want to show you something\u201D\
  , we entered this brownish yellowish shop that is full of shelves and that cheesy\
  \ smell and we started to glimpse at every shelve and let our mouths enjoy that\
  \ heavenly taste. He looked excited showing me around and taking me through the\
  \ city in a quick tour, passing over Amsterdam canals, watching the day turn into\
  \ night with the glamorous lightning of the cafes and restaurants creating another\
  \ kind of a sun, not knowing that in fact, it was me who was flying up in the air,\
  \ leaving behind all the despair, roaming a city with a stranger experiencing new\
  \ senses other than mine. And for the first time, in a long time, I felt that a\
  \ random decision renewed my existence, and without that hot day in Egypt, and the\
  \ traffic jam, I would be most probably walking in my worries in the streets of\
  \ Egypt."
