Text: "In 2015 I was doing a journey around South America with my sister, we started\
  \ in Salvador Bahia, and came down till where this story happens, Rio de Janeiro.\
  \ \nI really enjoy doing hikings, so I didn't rest until I could go up all those\
  \ mountains that Rio has, in order to get best sightseeing possible of the city.\
  \ My sister is an adventurer like my but the problem is that she has low stamina,\
  \ and as her little brother, I would of course being mocking her for being so slow\
  \ going up the mountains.\nOne day, when we finished climbing a big rock called\
  \ Pedra Bonita, my sister saw this guy paragliding and screamed \"- I WANT TO DO\
  \ THAT!\" and the guy yelled back \"-FIND ME ON FACEBOOK BY ODILON JR FLY\". \n\
  So me and her ended up booking a paragliding fly for the day after, with that guy.\
  \ I am that kind of guy that likes to be with his feet on the ground, but still\
  \ I accepted the challenge, and the day after I was there with my sister and two\
  \ other friends that we made before booking it. \nThe guy explained all the safe\
  \ instructions before the jump and that made feel confortable, I said that I wanted\
  \ to be the last so I could see what would happen before. My sister went first and\
  \ loved it, then the other two, but right before my turn to go with the instructor,\
  \ the guy before me, while departing his parachute closed and he fell, I froze,\
  \ completely.\nThe parachute of this closes right in front of my face, I was in\
  \ shock, but suddenly in opens again and I just see him setting off again in middle\
  \ air, it was crazy and lucky. I asked Odilon \"- Hey, is that normal? I didn't\
  \ want to get hurt today!\" I said it like joking but with stunning fear, and he\
  \ said to me \"- Don't worry kiddo, I am a national champion of precise landing\
  \ for 23 years straight, nothing is going to happen!\" I felt relieved but still\
  \ while departing I thing I pooped my pants a little bit. At the end, it was one\
  \ of the most remarcable experiences of my life. I am grateful for my sister to\
  \ ask the guy, and also proud of myself for conquering that fear in an instant as\
  \ well."
