Text: "Testing of my limits has been a loop in my life. By now it\u2019s my choice\
  \ but the decision that pushed me to the edge was the violent personality of my\
  \ mother and lead me to escape from home to a new area. The chosen place was Puerto\
  \ Vallarta. My 16 year logic was: \"It's spring break and rumor has it this places\
  \ always need bilingual staff, besides everything is better compared with living\
  \ with constant fear\". \n\nSo after traveling through the underground veins of\
  \ Mexico City I found an alternative medicine stand that sold me herbal sleeping\
  \ pills, I gave them to my mother and after the pills hit the spot, I ran away and\
  \ bought a bus ticket to Puerto Vallarta. I wandered most of that night and part\
  \ of the morning in the streets of Mexico City until it was time to leave. The bus\
  \ left at 19:40 and arrived 14 hours later.\nThis was the first time in my life\
  \ I was by my own and trust my gut. I barely could sleep that night aboard the bus,\
  \ I kept looking outside the window and watched how the urban landscapes transform\
  \ into forwarding green stains. I was nervous till the core of my bones, but also\
  \ sure about the excitement growing inside me and the developing love for adventure\
  \ about the uncertainties only the road can teach.\n\nMy first image when I arrived\
  \ at the bus station was color in every expression, there were lots of candies the\
  \ sellers tried to convince me to buy, I'm sure there has to be an exclusive Pantone\
  \ for the \u201Ccuala or mango cajeta\u201D. Next sensation was the overwhelming\
  \ heat that punched me right in my pale city face. With my backpack, 1400 pesos\
  \ and rushing thoughts in my mind, I took a folkloric green and white public bus\
  \ with destination to Bucerias. I lived in \u201CCactus Inn Hotel\u201D for 4 days\
  \ until the money was gone. The rumor was truth, I found multiple jobs and met a\
  \ lot of \u201CPata Saladas\u201D (nickname for local people). If you walked in\
  \ 2006 near the central kiosk you might have seen me trying to convince tourists\
  \ to chill in the restaurant I was working. Beer buckets and fresh shrimps for 5\
  \ dollars were my hook, I learned the importance of work, how to be independent\
  \ and also survive the world.\n\nHurricane John arrived in August and with its arrival\
  \ my adventure was blown away. The police found me and brought me back home. By\
  \ this moment I was sorry for the pain my family went through, but the adventure\
  \ spirit had waked up, I knew the road will call me back, only this time I wouldn't\
  \ have to run away. The Pata Salada Nomad Girl story had just begun."
