Text: "In Nila\u2019s third-story, open-air kitchen, I fry spices in a pan with a\
  \ wobbly handle while she squeezes tomatoes to a pulp in her hands. The mountains\
  \ ringing Lake Atitl\xE1n throw green, brown and yellow onto the water. I see the\
  \ same colors in Nila\u2019s cortes, her traditional skirt, as if the mountains\u2019\
  \ reflected light reaches even into our concrete-floored pavilion. Nila runs a weaving\
  \ collective here in San Pedro La Laguna, in Guatemala, for single mothers like\
  \ herself, and teaches Mayan cooking for extra income.\n\nShe tells me that she\
  \ left her husband after two years of marriage. Her mother said Nila was the family\u2019\
  s shame. This was the darkest time in Nila\u2019s life.\n\nNila says: \u201CI could\
  \ not see my way forward.\u201D\n\nIn the Mayan story of creation, the Popul Vuh,\
  \ the gods cloud the vision of the first humans so that they will not become like\
  \ the gods themselves, able to see and understand all. The gods obscured their sight\
  \ as if breathing a mist onto the surface of a mirror. \n\nI know this blankness.\
  \ These last few years I have been paralyzed in a dark fog, unable to act. When\
  \ I tell people I\u2019m taking a year off to travel, I sound like I know what I\u2019\
  m all about. In truth, I\u2019m traveling because I don\u2019t know what else to\
  \ do.\n\nRight now though, I have this: We make tamales. We cup and fold banana\
  \ leaves around cornmeal, tie them with a strip of agave leaf that has been softened\
  \ over the flame of the gas stove. Later in the photos I take of Nila working, I\
  \ will see that her hands blur.\n\nOn the lake, two water taxis speed toward each\
  \ other. They cross, separate, their foamy wakes sloshing together in the widening\
  \ distance between them.\n\nNila says: \u201CI asked God\u2013I am not trying to\
  \ preach, it is just my experience\u2013I asked for just one opportunity.\u201D\
  \ My eyes snap back to her face. She tells me how one day an American couple stopped\
  \ her for directions in the street, and she answered back in English. They hired\
  \ her to teach them Mayan cooking. They bought blankets she wove on her backstrap\
  \ loom.\n\nNila says: \u201CI tell you my story because it\u2019s important.\u201D\
  \ I have stars in my eyes. No one has given her permission to feel that way, to\
  \ do anything she\u2019s done. I breathe in, then out. My lips tingle. This is how\
  \ life works.\n\nI leave carrying four tamales in a cloth tote. I think about how\
  \ some people have eyes that keep trying to look farther. They look outside their\
  \ house, their village, their country even.\n\nAnd eventually they are able to see."
