Text: "Extraordinary is often found in the details of the most ordinary, a realization\
  \ that seeped in while I was hustling my way through the humdrum of everyday life.\
  \ Last summer, I was working as volunteer with the Tibetan diaspora living in exile,\
  \ in Dharamshala. I had had a long day, so, I allowed myself the luxury of taking\
  \ refuge in literature, in the solace of the timeless wisdom of Mitch Albom\u2019\
  s Professor Morrie. The account made me wistfully reminiscent of my late grandpa,\
  \ I\u2019d often find myself obsessively re-reading the highlighted verses. In days\
  \ like these it instilled in me a strange sense of ease.\nWith an eventful afternoon\
  \ to look forward to, I skedaddled my way out of the caf\xE9. Rinchen, who was well\
  \ versed in Lhasa, was going to arrange for a meeting with one of the oldest members\
  \ of the diaspora, Pema. If you picked a number to determine his years of living,\
  \ he\u2019d probably be a little older than that. His face was heavily lined and\
  \ he would often stumble on his own words when he spoke at length. As we sat down,\
  \ the monochrome murk of the rainy evening seemed to set a somber tone for the afternoon.\
  \ Rinchen, solemnly translated stating that beyond the historical narrative painted\
  \ by the victors, the mountains stood testimony to the harrowing lengths of atrocities\
  \ committed by men against each other. He told us of the three generations of his\
  \ family that were sacrificed in the \u2018cultural revolution\u2019 and how fleeing\
  \ persecution had become a way of life for them. Bewildered by his accounts of recollection,\
  \ I looked away at the ochre-colored huts, drying up from the deceptive sunlight.\
  \ \nAt this moment, all of us paused and peered at the sky to look at the peaks\
  \ revealing themselves from the girdle of the clouds. Pema, looked at the mountains\
  \ and while he spoke in Lhasa, I thought his milky old eyes grieve in ways they\
  \ don\u2019t even realize. My friend, then told me he was stuck admiring the mountains\
  \ that stole everything from him, consumed generations in flesh and blood when they\
  \ tried to make the perilous escape. They didn\u2019t grieve, I thought, it was\
  \ a hateful sigh in the eyes of a man who held such a devout spiritual calm.\nWe\
  \ were interrupted by a young little urchin selling pots of tea, who tried hard\
  \ to keep his pantomime mellow. All of us took loud sips and when my eyes met Pema\u2019\
  s, he smiled at me with the glow of a thousand splendid suns and in that moment,\
  \ he knew his story was not lost in translation and I knew that I had found Morrie\
  \ in a Monastery, on a Tuesday."
