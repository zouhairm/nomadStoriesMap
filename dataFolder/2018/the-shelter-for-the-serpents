Text: "It was a venomous dark side of the world. It seemed like only one step separated\
  \ me from death. And I took that step.\nHundreds of snakes jumped up from the sandy\
  \ ground and attacked me to kill.\nThat moment you just forget that you are all\
  \ covered with a special protection costume and feel as if you were naked and unprotected.\n\
  Sharp teeth dug inside the outer layer of the costume and the snakes hung all around\
  \ me, squirming and twisting.\nFear. Irrational animal fear. You don\u2019t think\
  \ whether those snakes could bite through your costume. You don\u2019t think at\
  \ all. Just fear.\nWelcome to The Caucasus.\nIf you are lucky then, maybe, you will\
  \ never meet any snake there. Especially venomous.\nBut if you are curious and crazy\
  \ enough you would find a place that is under the law but provides an unforgettable\
  \ experience of meeting those creepy creeping creatures of all kinds.\nYou have\
  \ to pay for this though. Two hundred dollars to get scared as much as you\u2019\
  ve never thought you could be.\nAs far as I know, they collect snakes from the places\
  \ people live and instead of killing them settle them in their strange serpentarium.\n\
  And when you walk through the valley between the tops of the mountains you can\u2019\
  t even imagine that behind one of them there is a secret shelter for snakes.\nYou\
  \ can\u2019t get there without a permission. You have to find the right people that\
  \ can lead you there. And it reminded me of \u201CThe Beach\u201D by Alex Garland.\
  \ There was no map, anyway, all the paths were in the guide\u2019s head, who led\
  \ me to the place with my eyes covered with a mask for the last fifteen minutes\
  \ of the journey. And it was almost as much freaking as the experience with the\
  \ snakes itself.\nYou should be smart enough to leave someone out there to know\
  \ who you left with and where. I was. But I felt relief only after coming back safe\
  \ and sound. There were some rumors about disappeared tourists who, by the legend,\
  \ left with a fake guide and never came back.\nOne more tip: pay only after staying\
  \ alive or even better forget about all you\u2019ve just read because you won\u2019\
  t be able to forget about those dreadful snakes, hanging all around you.\nAnd you\
  \ won\u2019t be able not to scream when the workers try to release you and take\
  \ the creeping beasts off your thanks-God-safe costume.\nIt is more peaceful and\
  \ soul-saving to simply walk through the pastoral landscapes, through the striking\
  \ beautiful valleys between the tops of the magnificent mountains and never know\
  \ that somewhere out there there is a shelter for terrifying serpents."
