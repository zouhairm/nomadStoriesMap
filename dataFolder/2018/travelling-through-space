Text: "Architecture.I have often wondered about that word.Its meaning & significance.Everywhere\
  \ I went, I continued my exploration of the word.Over the years, I got a fair idea\
  \ of what it entails but never a clear picture.\nOur local cultural center was hosting\
  \ an Architecture exhibition.I had been to the center a dozen times.Be it a writing\
  \ competition, photography exhibition or a dance performance, I had attended all.The\
  \ cultural center, when looked at from the sky above, can be seen as made from nine\
  \ squares, or mandala.\nThus, my reluctance. I had seen the space numerous times.It\
  \ was beautiful.Like a human body,  everything was build from the same smallest\
  \ element.A square.Be it the doors, windows, stairs, railings.The awed expressions\
  \ from those who visit it are well deserved.Still, for the ones who have seen it\
  \ many times, one loses interest.\nAt the very end, my sister won.We did go.The\
  \ exhibition covered three out of the nine squares.The first sign of change was\
  \ the influx was a huge sphere in the middle of the entrance foyer.It was not disruptive,\
  \ rather perspective.The added sphere of six feet height added another layer to\
  \ the consecutive rectangular doors on both sides.The first gallery consisted of\
  \ a single construct.A miniature house built in steel, showing merely its own skeleton.It\
  \ represented what mattered the most, what enabled it to keep standing after years\
  \ of weathering.The next display was a section of an apartment.It showed the beautiful\
  \ harmony that people share while living in apartments.The interaction of stairs,open\
  \ spaces,alternate balconies, all varied lifestyles co-existing peacefully.  \n\
  Mirrors are an ingrained part of our lives.On walls, in window panes,in our cars,\
  \ everywhere.The next exhibit was the signified use of mirror.Large panes of reflective\
  \ mirrors hanging from the ceiling via two thin wires, at different angles & heights.The\
  \ space was created to signify reflection. Of what our cities and surroundings have\
  \ become and how we are ignorant towards them to an extent that even after receiving\
  \ glaring evidences of our destruction of this planet, we do nothing.\nAll these\
  \ spaces made me realize the meaning of true architecture. The need for one convert\
  \ a space into whatever that is necessary for the moment and in the process creating\
  \ a whole new dimension the physical built space. The experience did not replace\
  \ my memories of the previous visit but rather helped in adding more layers to it\
  \ as I traveled through space."
