Text: "So i was on my Way to Amsterdam, roadtrippin' in my car for a couple of days\
  \ this summer. Actually no big deal for me i thought, i did a roadtrip like this\
  \ before so i kinda new what i was doing and what it's like to be alone in your\
  \ car for a few days. Honestly i love travelling like this- being completely alone,\
  \ figuring everything out yourself, making all of these amazing expieriences on\
  \ your own in blissful stillness, filling up your heart on the beauty all around\
  \ you and not having to speak a word or expressing these emotions. Solo travelling\
  \ always reminded me of the importance of the very moment. It forces you to be present,\
  \ there is noone else but you so you better be present. \nSo i was driving for about\
  \ 5 hours and just entered the netherlands and got so tired. The weather was way\
  \ too hot and somehow something felt wrong this time. I was confused. The last trip\
  \ like that was pure magic so why was i feeling so weird this time? I knew i needed\
  \ to rest and so i was looking for a place to park the car for sleeping. It took\
  \ me hours of driving around, looking for the perfect place. Nothing felt safe,\
  \ i didn't want to stay anywhere. So eventually i parked the car next to a pasture\
  \ and it actually looked very nice and peaceful there. It reminded me of the english\
  \ countryside with all the sheeps everywhere so i thought i just needed a little\
  \ rest and it would be all good the next day. I got ready and set up my car for\
  \ the night, had something to eat and looked up a few things online dir the next\
  \ day when my phone suddenly died. I plugged it into the charger just to find out\
  \ that it was broken. So i wanted to start my car to load my phone with the Adapter\
  \ that i bought for it only to der that it also wasn't  working. I burst into tears.\
  \ I couldn't hold it back anymore and felt like this hole entire trip just wasnt\
  \ ment to be. I thought about leaving, going back home and in the end i cried myself\
  \ to sleep in the middle of nowhere. \nWhen i woke up the next morning i knew that\
  \ this trip wasn't going to be like my last one and i accepted that completely.\
  \ I expected an easy peasy ride just like the last one and got super frustrated\
  \ when i had to Face some complications. I almost felt ashamed for being such a\
  \ crybaby. A friendly biker told me the Way to the next bigger Store and i bought\
  \ a charger and an adapter to load my phone and drove to Amsterdam right away. \n\
  In the end i'm grateful for this experience and it taught me that nothing is really\
  \ as bad as we think it it."
