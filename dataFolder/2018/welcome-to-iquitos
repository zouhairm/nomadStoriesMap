Text: "The Amazon Rainforest is one of the most alive places on Earth. In every square\
  \ inch, layers and layers of life climb upon each other, nourish each other; rotting\
  \ and being born seem indistinguishable, and you have the overwhelming impression\
  \ of observing an enormous amount of pure Life while coming right out of its forge.\n\
  One of the peruvian doors to the Amazon is the city of Iquitos. Maybe because of\
  \ the influence of Amazon\u2019s ancestral magic and its psychedelic plants, the\
  \ time spent in Iquitos has the same illogical consistance of mirages. You're not\
  \ capable of saying how days go by, like when you try to tell a dream; you find\
  \ yourself dwelling there longer than you thought, and you can't really say why.\n\
  Somewhat coherently, Iquitos has no roads to connect it to the rest of the country:\
  \ to get there, it\u2019s flight or boat.\nI chose the second option, and looked\
  \ for a harbor through the yellow, dusty sunlight of the roads of Pucallpa. In the\
  \ ship I found, to my amusement, tens of colorful hammocks hanging from the low\
  \ ceiling of the large room, where I would have been stuffed three days with all\
  \ the other passengers. \nThe trip was chiseled with many pleasant moments: sunset,\
  \ beer and tales shared among travellers on the roof of the boat; locals explaining\
  \ their ways of life; buying strange food from sellers entering the ship at stops;\
  \ even the merry cockadoodledoo hailing the dawn of the last day, sung by a 100%\
  \ real cock, luggage of an old lady.\nDocked in Iquitos, to avoid waiting the unload\
  \ of the cargo, we accepted a ride by one of the small boats, which surrounded the\
  \ ship like a cloud of fishes does with a whale; in some minutes we were ready to\
  \ get off on a free quay, a little further.\nWell, let\u2019s say that it\u2019\
  s not wise to keep your backpack on your shoulders, trying to step out from such\
  \ a tiny boat.\nIn no more than half a second I realize that the boat is moving,\
  \ my balance is almost lost, and I'm too far from any support; I say \u201Cno\u201D\
  , surprisingly quietly after all, given the circumstances; and I fall, backpack,\
  \ waistbag and everything, in the river.\nLuckily a fellow traveller is strong enough\
  \ to pull me back in the boat: you don\u2019t want to find yourself in deep fresh\
  \ waters with more than 10 kilos on your shoulders. But he puts me down as he can,\
  \ that is on my back, that is on my backpack. So, to get up again, I start to sway\
  \ arms and legs..\nMy staying in Iquitos began like this: baptised in the Amazon\
  \ River, upside-down like a turtle on its shell."
