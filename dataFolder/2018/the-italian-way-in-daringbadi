Text: "Bosusco Paolo an Italian tourist with Claudio Colangelo a fellow national never\
  \ thought of getting a lifetime lesson; while exploring Daringbadi, a small hill\
  \ station in Kandhmal District of Odisha. Their dream to trek and enjoy amidst the\
  \ scenic beauty of the place was shattered in no time. It was hard to believe but\
  \ the conformation came as Maoists kidnapped the duo on 14 March 2012 from a jungle\
  \ on Kandhamal-Ganjam border. \nThe International media focused in breaking news\
  \ from Daringbadi in March 2012. The World wanted to know about the further development\
  \ of the hostages in every second. The Chief Minister requested the rebels to release\
  \ them from humanitarian ground. The security was tightened. The local administration\
  \ with media was keen on spotting the hostages. \nThe spread of news of small town\
  \ incident had a dreadful impact to the state tourism industry as many of the abroad\
  \ bookings got canceled gradually. The serene, sublime and beautiful land was deserted\
  \ like a cursed barren land. \nTime has healed; the incident has taken a back seat\
  \ with the safe release of hostages within a month. After a gap of six long years,\
  \ Daringbadi could witness and celebrate the coming of eight Italian tourists this\
  \ February. The forests as well as the police officers were present to make them\
  \ feel a pleasant stay. They enjoyed meeting and talking to the locals. Italian\
  \ way they took selfie with them in the market place and were off to explore the\
  \ scenic spots of the station. The arrival of the foreign tourist overwhelmed the\
  \ people over there. This was seen as the renewal of the pact between both sides.\
  \ The curse has been taken back; the barren land signals a promise to be fruitful\
  \ again. \nDaringbadi, a small hill station widely known as the Kashmir of Odisha\
  \ is situated at an altitude of 3000 feet; guarantees as an ideal vacation destination\
  \ with a micro climatic zone. The place attracts tourist from different parts of\
  \ the world to explore its natural beauty and rich cultural heritage. It is the\
  \ only place in the state where mercury goes down to a record level and witnesses\
  \ a mild snow fall in winter. \nThe destination is blessed with thick forests with\
  \ wild animals, Pine and Eucalyptus Jungles, Beautiful Valleys and Plateaus with\
  \ Coffee, Black Pepper and Turmeric gardens. Hill view point gives a panoramic view\
  \ of the valley from the watch tower. Sun set at the Silent Valley, attractive Waterfalls\
  \ and Emu birds will compel one to make a trip again to this place."
