Text: "Hainan is a small tropical island in the South China Sea, relatively untouched\
  \ despite its immense tourist-trap potential.  It\u2019s also the childhood home\
  \ of my father-in-law.  One visit, when he told us we were on our way to the best\
  \ restaurant on the whole island, there was no question the food would be superb,\
  \ but I was a bit worried.  My generation has come to expect \u201Cbest restaurant\u201D\
  \ to mean five star decor, artistic plating, astronomical prices, and Google-perfect\
  \ reviews.  Not to mention a strict dress code.  At that moment, the five of us\
  \ (me, my husband Jim, his dad, and his two uncles) were wearing grungy travel clothes\
  \ stained with the exertions of a day\u2019s adventures. We were very under-dressed.\n\
  \nOur minivan bumped along a narrow dirt road and stopped in front of a rectangular\
  \ cement hut.  Palm trees grew through the tire-covered roof and there were no doors\
  \ or windows.  A well-fed man in a baggy golf shirt and khaki shorts ushered us\
  \ inside, past a wood burning stove and colanders of fresh-picked vegetables, over\
  \ to a charcoal-stained corner.  Round plastic tubs sat on the floor in cheery colors\
  \ of red and orange. Swimming inside was the morning\u2019s catch.  Jim and I were\
  \ shooed outdoors, leaving his father and uncles to the serious task of ordering.\
  \ \n\nAcross the yard on a cement patio was our table topped with rice bowls, chopsticks,\
  \ tea cups, and little dishes piled with fresh minced garlic, sliced red chilies,\
  \ and round little limes.  We sat in mismatched folding chairs looking out at the\
  \ dock and palm-fringed inlet.  Old paint-splintered fishing boats bobbed to each\
  \ other, the gossamer tangle of fishing nets drying on open decks, the sound of\
  \ water slapping between them.\nJim\u2019s dad and uncles soon joined us, chattering\
  \ in Cantonese about the upcoming meal.  The vague English translations were \u201C\
  crab\u201D, \u201Cfish\u201D, \u201Cgood stuff\u201D.  Words that didn\u2019t prepare\
  \ me for what actually landed, hot and steaming, on our table.  A rock crab arrived,\
  \ its meteor-grey shell covered in ginger and scallions with soft juicy meat inside.\
  \  Another crab had a pink shell with seven cranberry-sized dots (\u201Cstars\u201D\
  , I was told).  Next, a sea anemone.  Sharp purple spines outside, a creamy yolk\
  \ inside.  And finally, a fish, the freshest I\u2019ve ever tasted, with bones as\
  \ blue as the sea.  \n\nThis restaurant will probably never exist online, but maybe\
  \ that\u2019s okay because it would far exceed five stars.  Maybe seven would be\
  \ enough.  Seven crab stars, to be exact.  Black tie, optional."
