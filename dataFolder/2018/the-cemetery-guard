Text: "The wet grass made pieces of dirt stick onto my shoes as I walked through the\
  \ cemetery. I walked slowly next to the tombs reading names, days of birth, and\
  \ death. One tomb had my same birthday engraved into its concrete. I stared at it,\
  \ and shifted my shoes against the wet grass.\n\nCemeteries always made me sad,\
  \ but I had travelled over 2,000 miles to visit one. This one where my cousin lay\
  \ to rest in Guatemala. \n\nIt had been eleven years since I had last visited Guatemala\
  \ and eleven years waiting to return. This country, this soil, had been calling\
  \ me back since my cousin had been buried in it. I remembered how we used to play\
  \ in the soil, as kids, her and I would dirty our hands and feet making mud pies\
  \ and decorating them with flowers we had collected from my uncle\u2019s garden.\
  \ \n\nShe made the ground come to life when she would scoop the dirt up offering\
  \ me to join in her imagination, and now I sat next to her tomb listening to the\
  \ trees move and using my imagination to think of what she would say to me in that\
  \ moment. \n\nThe trees settled for a moment and the wind picked up the voices of\
  \ my mom and grandmother, both talking to the cemetery  guard. He was a man burnt\
  \ by the sun, dressed in navy blue and holding a rifle. I stood and quietly circled\
  \ into their conversation. He smiled at me revealing his one gold tooth and he asked\
  \ who we were visiting. He knew the cemetery very well, and explained to us she\
  \ was where the children were brought. \n\nHis presence, for whatever reason, was\
  \ reassuring and I could tell my mother and grandmother felt it too. He began to\
  \ talk about the afterlife, his faith, and how he had no fear in working in a cemetery.\
  \ We listened intently, and I wondered if my mother and grandmother were looking\
  \ for a lesson too, something meaningful in an unexpected place. \n\nBefore we left,\
  \ I asked if I could take a picture of him, he straightened himself, as if a soldier\
  \ ready to receive a medal, and I snapped the photo. We made our way out of the\
  \ cemetery, and I blew a kiss towards the direction of my cousin. \n\nMy mother\
  \ and grandmother still talking about the guard\u2019s outlook on life both agreed\
  \ they could have continued talking to him for more hours. I smiled in agreement.\
  \ I had come looking for an answer, a reason, and I left with a meaningful conversation\
  \ about life with an unexpected person at an unexpected place. As we walked further\
  \ away into the busy street the gravel picked away the dirt from my shoes."
