Text: "Through snowy mountains and magic trees this road led us to our chalet. You\
  \ go to sleep and dream of next day skiing as if it a Christmas Day. You can be\
  \ lucky if it\u2019s ski in or out place you are staying in, otherwise get ready\
  \ for dragging  your heavy skies into a slope next day. I love our path as it takes\
  \ us through forest with a small spring where I always stop to mediate for a few\
  \ minutes when I come back and listen to the water talks. I never thought a few\
  \ years that I ever can conquer these magnificent mountains which are scary and\
  \ yet mesmerizing when the sun comes out. Now I can tell that I am getting better\
  \ and more confident which gives me enough power to ski far away from our chalet\
  \ and learn more about Meribel, Val Thorens and a lot of small villages that can\
  \ be found after Courchevel. You can always stay here and explore all Courchevel\
  \ villages and slopes with its amazing choice of restaurants. Most of the time we\
  \ stop for lunch and I have to say that you can\u2019t describe this atmosphere\
  \ of all skiers gathered together and sharing this delicious pizza with truffles\
  \ at Milles Sabords or some nice homemade raclette with warm potatoes at the farm,\
  \ or end up having the famous soup by Paul Bocuse at La Table de mon grand pere.\
  \ I love this feeling when after warm lunch you are back on a slope and ski as fast\
  \ as you can to burn all these gained calories:)  Back to your chalet you can make\
  \ yourself a cup of tea with lemon and honey, lit up your fireplace and spend a\
  \ cozy evening surrounded by family and freinds. We always bring some cards and\
  \ end up playing my favorite \u2018Mafia\u2019 game which is so much of fun. Bedtime\
  \ and you plan already your next day ski route and excited as if you never skied\
  \ before. Surround yourself by mountains, white trees and loved ones what more you\
  \ can wish for... and ski ski ski as if you\u2019re flying above the clouds with\
  \ clear head and emptiness that makes you feel loved and alive every time you come\
  \ here."
