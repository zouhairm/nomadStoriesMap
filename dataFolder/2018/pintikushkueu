Text: "January 2016, Labrador\n\nA journey of 12 hours in the expanse of emptiness.\n\
  The immense forest, the snow, the rivers and the cold frosting the windows of the\
  \ train.\n\nIn the heat of my compartment, I follow the path of the nomads.\nI travel\
  \ by train the 500 kilometers between Sept-\xCEles and Schefferville.\nI relive-\
  \ in the confort of the Tshiuetin- the journey that the nomads of the Matimekosh\
  \ community traveled on foot and canoe.\n\nIn the train, everyone knows each other.\n\
  Quickly, one wonders who I am.\nOne wonders above all, what I came to do there.\n\
  Here, we do not see many foreigners.\nSometimes, one comes to lose oneself but it\
  \ is uncommon. \nEspecially by this cold.\nThe thermometer reads -38 C.\nWhat am\
  \ I doing here ? \n\nIt's around a lukewarm coffee of the restaurant wagon that\
  \ we begin to tell our stories. \nInnus and me. \nWe meet again.\n\nINNU means human.\n\
  In Innu country, I understood the difference between \"human\" and \"human-beeing\"\
  , a semantic distinction that often comes up in the interviews I conduct. Between\
  \ the socialized, \"civilized\" individual and the naked existence. The essence\
  \ in itself, the one that connects us to the land, the animals, the spirits, and\
  \ the cold. It is this semantic difference that I question during my interviews,\
  \ it is this gap in which I slip and which guides my camera. I try to understand\
  \ how the Innus are straddling two realities, that of their grandparents, their\
  \ traditions, their beliefs inherited from a nomadic life and the one in which they\
  \ now live and that they have made their own. \n\nA troubling syncretism that also\
  \ speaks about me.\n\nAs I travel, I get to know people who want to tell their story.\
  \ Wonderful and harsh, it opens the doors to a gigantic questioning. What is my\
  \ place, who am I and what to do with these confidences ? A M\xE9tis in Innu country,\
  \ a spectator, an impostor, and many times a friend. \n\nI continue my journey,\
  \ always further to the East, I go in search of those who are \u201Cborn in the\
  \ tent\u201D as they call the seniors here. And from community to community, I become\
  \ Pintikushkueu: the black woman with the camera. I interview and photograph many\
  \ people, I assist to ceremonies and trances and those encounters upset me as much\
  \ as they fascinate and inspire me. I am a foreigner and yet I feel at home. I find\
  \ traditions and modes of existence that I know and understand, I approach my  roots\
  \ through the meeting of an\"other\"who tells me about me in the history of a colonization\
  \ of a 1000 faces.\n\nI observe, I listen."
