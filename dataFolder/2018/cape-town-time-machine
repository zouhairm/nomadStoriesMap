Text: "Cities are magical. With a little imagination, they can transport you across\
  \ time and space. I may not have travelled physically yet, but I\u2019ve certainly\
  \ traversed the globe by proxy: through books, film and television. Since starting\
  \ university in 2015, I\u2019ve made the daily commute from the suburbs into the\
  \ heart of the city of Cape Town.  \nThe stop-start journey by train takes approximately\
  \ 45-minutes.The train pulls into the station. I take the Strand street exit and\
  \ cross six lanes, rushed by oncoming traffic on one side, weaving past bumpers\
  \ on the other. The opposite sidewalk reeks of urine, a little further down a throng\
  \ of drivers are standing outside their minibus taxis, most mornings they\u2019\
  re loudly cracking jokes \u2013 once I saw them loaded in the back of one the taxi\u2019\
  s sharing a bucket of chicken for breakfast.\n Past the taxis and the covered bus\
  \ terminal, where queuing passengers are herded by blue railings, is the Grand Parade.\
  \ Like a bishop, I cut diagonally across the Parade, a public square, to my right\
  \ is the Cape Town City Hall, its honey-coloured limestone gleaming, from its steps\
  \ Nelson Mandela addressed a crowd of thousands for the first time, they were gathered\
  \ in this very square. The homeless, unemployed and stalls which populate the square\
  \ are literally kicked to the curb whenever there\u2019s another political rally\
  \ or any event that requires pop-up fencing and portable toilets. To my left is\
  \ the Castle of Good Hope and dead ahead is the sleeping giant that watches over\
  \ the city, Table Mountain. One of the natural wonders of the world, it\u2019s easy\
  \ to forget how exceptional it is because I see it every day. I\u2019m reminded\
  \ of, if not transported to Hemingway\u2019s Paris every time I set foot on the\
  \ cobblestone of Greenmarket Square and see its cafes.\n Awards and accolades may\
  \ attract tourists but it\u2019s the people that populate the city that make it\
  \ special, faces I see every day or familiar strangers in the crowd, the young advocate\
  \ smoking outside the cornershop next to the family court, the homeless man and\
  \ his cup of coins that never stray more than one block away from the Distict 6\
  \ museum. Sirens and blue lights blaring down Roeland Street, thoroughfare to parliament\
  \ or jail. The city is alive and I feel a part of it, there\u2019s a connection\
  \ that doesn\u2019t exist in the suburbs. Where the suburbs are stagnant, familiar\
  \ and often contemptuous, the city is fast, impersonal, and too busy to wish you\
  \ favour or ill, it just allows you to be."
