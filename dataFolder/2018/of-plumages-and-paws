Text: "The highways of Rajasthan in India,are famous for colorful and beautiful sights\
  \ and sounds. I saw him from afar, right when he was opening up to the morning sun.\
  \ There he was, standing in full glory, his neck held high and proud,and his tail\
  \ opened to the fullest. He was a sight to behold standing haughtily in the middle\
  \ of the road.\nThe early morning sun light striking his eyes and making them shine\
  \ like stars in cloudless nights.The light passing through the slight slits in his\
  \ tail, looked like lights passing through the windows of some ancient church with\
  \ glass painted windows.He was oblivious to his surrounding. \nThe clouds overhead\
  \ started getting darker and slowly the suns rays faded,giving way to a beautiful\
  \ shade that made him almost pop out of the background.As the winds got a little\
  \ stronger,and the first few drops of rain started to fall,he moved his tail like\
  \ a fan and took a step forward.I was so enthralled that I forgot I had my camera\
  \ around my neck.His haughtiness and pride reminded me of royalty! There he was,the\
  \ King of the world at the moment,oblivious to us mortals. \nHis beautiful blue\
  \ and green plummege against the dark grey background of the rains was spectacular.This\
  \ was nature in its purest form and glory. \nWhat happened next is something that\
  \ still gives me shudders.What I saw and felt is something that will not leave my\
  \ being till I'm alive. \nOut of nowhere and without any sign or sound, a magnificent\
  \ tiger crept out of the bushes as stealthily and silently as is the beasts nature.The\
  \ tiger inched nearer with soft inaudible grace,while the peacock continued its\
  \ dance of glory unaware that death was creeping on him from behind slowly but surely.\
  \  \nWhat ensued next can only be described as nature at its best and worst, survival\
  \ of the fittest.The tiger took one graceful leap and landed with its whole weight\
  \ on the unsuspecting peacock.As his left paw touched the peococks back,the birds\
  \ feet gave way under the tremendous weight, simultaneously the right paw pressed\
  \ on the neck and snapped the neck with just one blow.The sound of the snap reverbrated\
  \ and reached my ears sending a tingle down my spine.And that was the macabre end\
  \ of a beautiful life.The only solace was that the bird never really knew what happened\
  \ to it. \nThis incident left me with a sense of awe and bought me face to face\
  \ with nature like never before. This was'nt something I had ever expected to be\
  \ a spectator too. Sights like these are what make me a wanderluster!"
