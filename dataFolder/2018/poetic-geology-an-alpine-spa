Text: "Submerging my body in hot thermal water, gazing up past the crisp quartzite\
  \ walls to the rugged ridges above; it was that specific moment in which I felt\
  \ a connection with the Alps.\n\nIt was February as I made my way to Vals, a Swiss\
  \ village deep in the Alps. One of as many residents as hotel beds and sheep, Vals\u2019\
  \ timber rooves glistened in the morning sun as we arrived at our destination for\
  \ the weekend. This journey was a pilgrimage to the renowned Therme Vals, a getaway\
  \ from chaotic city life, an opportunity to breathe fresh mountain air.\n\nWinding\
  \ through pine trees, along paths resembling strata, we stumbled upon the subtle\
  \ entrance. Softly-spoken ladies welcomed us, directing us down a corridor which\
  \ revealed the inherent materialistic dialogue with the surrounding earth: the texture\
  \ of the stone celebrates its Alpine heritage; smells of the spring water drift\
  \ up from the baths; sounds of people splashing and murmuring echo along the corridor.\
  \ Through the changing rooms, a ceremonial, yet modest, staircase leads into a large\
  \ open-plan bath, broken up by heavy stone-clad \u2018pillars\u2019. The space invites\
  \ a child-like exploration of its eight distinct baths, each hidden within the stone\
  \ walls; the journey between which offers glimpses of Alpine pastures through openings\
  \ in the cavernous walls. \n\nThe afternoon passed quickly, exploring each of the\
  \ small baths \u2013 hot, cold, scented. Outside, staring up at the snow-dusted\
  \ Alpine peaks, the monotony of a 9-5 seemed a distant reality. As the night drew\
  \ in, stars twinkled above my head, steam danced on the surface of the water and\
  \ a warm glow emanated from the heart of the baths like a fire glowing inside a\
  \ dark cave. The distinction between the striated facades and raw mountain cliffs\
  \ blurred, marrying the two harmoniously. Natural forces permeate this building,\
  \ inside and out; landscape and architecture inextricably linked. Leaving the baths\
  \ that night was a return to civilisation after an adventure hiking through mountain\
  \ passes, down narrow gorges and across Alpine streams.\n\nDrifting like a long-lost\
  \ dream, the poetic beauty and geologically-inspired nature of this architecture\
  \ will stay with me \u2013 the connection between built form and site, spiritual\
  \ and rugged beauty, man and mountain. Therme Vals has a special atmosphere, a mythical\
  \ ambience; rooting its topography with design. It\u2019s a building which speaks\
  \ to your soul and which forged in me an unforgettable spiritual connection with\
  \ nature."
