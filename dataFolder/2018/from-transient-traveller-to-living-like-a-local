Text: "There is a reason why the sharing economy has been so successful in tourism.\
  \ I believe that it\u2019s because we all have an innate desire to feel more like\
  \ a local than a tourist when visiting a foreign country.\n\nWaking up to the smell\
  \ of fresh papusas and frijoles in a house perched on the edge of Coatepeque Caldera,\
  \ a large volcanic crater lake, I felt like I wasn\u2019t just fleetingly passing\
  \ through El Salvador. I was experiencing something far rarer than that. I was living\
  \ like a local because I\u2019d made a local connection.\n\nWhere did it all begin?\
  \ As two foreign students, removed from our own countries and seeking \u201Chome\u201D\
  \ in new friendships, Andres and I met in Taipei. He was a kind, internationally-minded\
  \ local from El Salvador, studying an MBA at National Taiwan University. I, a recent\
  \ graduate from the University of Western Australia, was strengthening my Mandarin\
  \ language capability through further study at National Taiwan Normal University.\
  \ \n\nSeeking adventure and a taste of a Latin lifestyle, at the end of my university\
  \ semester I packed up my belongings, flew to South America and started working\
  \ for the Australian Chamber of Commerce in Chile. It was in December of 2015 that\
  \ I found myself as a solo traveller in Belize, running out of steam and craving\
  \ a way to spend Christmas in a familiar setting. Yet how would I find this feeling\
  \ of familiarity so far from what I call home? Should I rent a room through AirBnb?\
  \ Should I register myself on Couchsurfing and look for a friendly face to host\
  \ me?\n\nIn some regions of the world, it is arguably less safe for solo female\
  \ travellers to take part in the sharing economy experiences which transform your\
  \ way of life into those of a local. \n\nAndres helped me to experience El Salvador\
  \ as though I were living there. He invited me to join his family for the festive\
  \ season at their beach house in El Flor. \n\nThe week that followed was one of\
  \ the best of my life. I was warmly engulfed by his large family and included as\
  \ though I were one of their own. We played beach volleyball on black sand, kayaked\
  \ towards the setting sun on the last day of the year, danced the night away on\
  \ New Year\u2019s Eve and spent time getting to know one another like lifelong friends.\n\
  \nStaying in hostels, visiting landmarks and taking selfies are experiences which\
  \ frequently leave us feeling that the whole experience was purely transient. For\
  \ me, transformative experiences involve making local connections, like the one\
  \ that I have with Andres."
