Text: "It was cold outside when dusk started painting the sky. No wonder we couldn\u2019\
  t find ceiling-fans at any of the localities. Summer was still bearably cold as\
  \ per local people. However, during winters, many parts of Leh- Ladakh region is\
  \ closed for travelers.\n\n\u201CWhat would you like to have for dinner? We will\
  \ prepare as per your wish with ingredients available.\u201D the guy in his mid-twenties,\
  \ Abhinav stood with a pen and paper to take down my order.\n\nIt was a home stay\
  \ near Pangong Lake, India. It was cold enough to wear two jackets and one blanket\
  \ in June. After a drive through the tiring and roller coaster ride of hairpin turns\
  \ I was way too hungry. I asked him what are the things he can cook with the available\
  \ ingredients.\n\nSame sandwiches and food menu were a bit of frustration. Was fed\
  \ up of eating same thing for many days. Suddenly a thought popped up,\n\n\u201C\
  Do you know to make Khichdi and potato sabzi (curry)?\u201D My voice was loud I\
  \ realized then. He wondered if I was from the same planet and asked if I could\
  \ teach him how to prepare it.\n\nI snapped the opportunity to have home cooked\
  \ meal amidst cold breeze and snowy environment.\n\nAlong with three of his friends,\
  \ we prepared hot and spicy masala khichdi and potato gravy. We chopped vegetables,\
  \ washed utensils, added spices to our new dish. Warmth of fire filled warmth within\
  \ us too. My soul was satisfied by meal I generally avoided at home.\n\n\u201CThanks,\
  \ I learnt something new today.\u201D Abhinav told.\n\n\u201CEvery year during the\
  \ peak season, we come here to earn bit more and support our family. We had to learn\
  \ basic cooking coming here, and today you have added a dash of specialty in it.\
  \ I am very grateful to you.\u201D\n\nWe ate our dinner together and did offer it\
  \ to few fellow-foreigners who were waiting next to us. They kept staring at us\
  \ till we completed our deliciously cooked meal hastily as we all were hungry.\n\
  \nI never realized the dish we generally prepare when we are out of dining options\
  \ carried so much worth. We take things for granted when available and know its\
  \ true value afterwards. I felt delighted to eat something homely after 15 long\
  \ days. Joy of cooking and significance of a meal - I realized with him. He was\
  \ happy that now he can cook something unusual and make more customers. I just felt\
  \ that I was part of something bigger! As they say, World is one family."
