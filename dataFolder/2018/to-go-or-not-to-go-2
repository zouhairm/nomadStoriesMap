Text: "\u201CGood thing I'm not superstitious,\u201D I joked to friends about flying\
  \ to Paris on Friday the 13th, 2015. But the night I was getting ready to go, tweets\
  \ about a hostage situation in a Paris music venue flashed into my Twitter feed.\
  \ My roommates and I put the radio on \u2013 soon the scale of of the attacks was\
  \ clear. \n\nFriends texted frantically: \u201CAre you still here? Don't go!\u201D\
  \ they begged. I'm easily alarmed, but for once I was reluctant to cancel plans.\
  \ I was going to Paris for the first time in my life. I was going a month after\
  \ my mother's death, to shake off the sadness of caring for her as her dementia\
  \ progressed. \n\nMy friend in Paris was calm. \"Think of the big pot of cassoulet\
  \ I'll have waiting for you,\" she wrote. My much-traveled family would at least\
  \ go to the airport, I thought. I set off, dragging my heavy suitcase down the subway\
  \ stairs. \"Surely my plane will be canceled and the decision will be made for me,\"\
  \ I thought as my train rumbled out to JFK. \n\nAt the check-in counter, Aer Lingus\
  \ said my flight was on schedule. I kept emailing my friend in Paris with anxious\
  \ questions. She and my sister have the same name, and in my Gmail queue I kept\
  \ getting them mixed up. \"Should I come? I don't know how it will be in Paris,\"\
  \ I wrote my friend. \"The flights are landing, but Paris sounds bad\" replied a\
  \ weirdly detached-sounding friend (it turned out to be my sister). \"Just get on\
  \ the plane,\" my sister wrote me (or maybe it was my friend). My sister would never\
  \ cancel a trip. I'd annoyed her in the past by feeling too sick to travel and changing\
  \ my flight dates. I was the weakling who always changed her flight dates. Would\
  \ I be the weakling again? \n\nI thought of my mother, who would have gotten on\
  \ the plane. In our dynamic, she was big and strong, while I was little and weak.\
  \ Maybe it was time to take on her attributes, like an overcoat she'd left me.\n\
  \n\"OK, I'll go,\" I told the check-in person. She tagged my suitcase and set it\
  \ on the conveyor belt. I was struck by the irreversibility of my decision. Was\
  \ I crazy, flying into chaos and grief? Would Paris be Paris? \n\nWell, as the rest\
  \ of the world has known all along, each arrondissement is a world unto itself.\
  \ Paris had closed public buildings but in my friend's street were the enchanting\
  \ cafes I'd dreamed of. People sat there drinking beer and talking, looking into\
  \ each others' faces instead of cell phones. The city would not be quashed by a\
  \ horrific act of violence. It was Paris, and I was finally there."
