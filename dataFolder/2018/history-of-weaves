Text: "For any Indian woman, a sari is a symbol of effortless elegance and poise.\
  \ The soft weaves represent a woman\u2019s softness and the intricate designs symbolize\
  \ her dynamic personality. India has had a long relationship with this garment and\
  \ therefore it hardly surprising that each of the 29 states of the country has a\
  \ unique feature attached to the sari.\nChanderi, a small town in Madhya Pradesh\
  \ approximately 37 kilometres away from the nearest railway may be invisible on\
  \ maps of most travellers, but for women, this town is the source of one of the\
  \ most exquisite sari styles. The weaving industry here works without any reliance\
  \ on machines and their homes double-up as are their work-stations. The Chanderi\
  \ town came to be known for its weaves under the Scindia dynasty that reached their\
  \ zenith under the Mughals. One day before Christmas, I packed a duffle bag, took\
  \ a 6 am Shatabdi to Lalitpur and from there hired an auto-rickshaw to Chanderi.\
  \ The trip was devoted to talking to the weaver communities about the fabric, their\
  \ needs and what encourages them to keep going in this thankless job. The experience\
  \ was nothing short of a reaffirmation on one of the Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s teachings,\
  \ \u2018Simple living high thinking\u2019. Each sari, the whole nine yards takes\
  \ 7 days to weave, excluding the hand-dying the threads before they are woven into\
  \ the sari. Besides saris, the families have also started making salwars, kurtas\
  \ and dupattas to keep up with the current fashion trends. The weavers have very\
  \ little to complain, contrary to what I had thought and that left me positive and\
  \ eager to explore more. While there, I met a local who told me about a stepped-well\
  \ a few minutes away. He offered to guide me there. It may seem like an exaggeration\
  \ to the reader, but the stepped-well was the second-best highlight of my trip to\
  \ Chanderi. Going all the way to where the water met the stone steps and looking\
  \ at the sky through the reflection reminded me of the story \u2018Through the Looking\
  \ Glass\u2019. At that moment I felt like Alice with my own version of the upside-down\
  \ world.\nLeaving the small bylanes of Chanderi, I realized that while I had left\
  \ gained something that was far more significant than that fear that I had left.\
  \ No one can put this better than Shawna Grapentin, \u201Can adventurous life does\
  \ not necessarily mean climbing mountains, swimming with sharks, or jumping off\
  \ cliffs. It means risking yourself by leaving a little piece of you behind in all\
  \ those you meet along the way.\u201D"
