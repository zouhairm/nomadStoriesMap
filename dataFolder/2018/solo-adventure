Text: "These are hard times. Sometimes the cacophony of it all is enough to drive\
  \ you mad and it\u2019s not that you need to permanently remove yourself from reality,\
  \ but you do crave a moment\u2019s reprieve to breathe deeply again. That\u2019\
  s a large part of what pushed me to do one of the craziest things I\u2019ve ever\
  \ done \u2013 quit my job to pursue photography & kick it all off with a solo adventure\
  \ to two bucket list countries: Norway & the Faroe Islands. \n\nI hopped on a red\
  \ eye & soon landed on the Faroes, armed with my camera & awash with excitement.\
  \ A welcoming rainbow stretched wide over an inlet on the bus ride over to T\xF3\
  rshavn. I spent the day wandering the colorful capital, before ferrying over to\
  \ Norway, later to return for the rest of the islands. The ferry had an overnight\
  \ stopover in Hirtshals, where there was plenty to explore. I arrived in Bergen\
  \ and met my host, who had a killer record collection & a little refuge for the\
  \ neighborhood stray cat. I then embarked on a train tour that went through the\
  \ southwestern fjord region of Norway & wow were these spots a wonder to behold.\
  \ After enjoying a rainy rest day, I headed back to the Faroes. Iceland is the hot-ticket\
  \ destination du jour (& for good reason), but these islands are like a best kept\
  \ secret. Tourists are a rare sight & even the residential population is sparse.\n\
  \nThe beauty of the Faroes is largely in how untouched they are. There\u2019s a\
  \ rawness to the land outside the capital that\u2019s compounded by the ever-changing\
  \ weather. In mere hours, it can go from sunny skies to rain to snow & back again.\
  \ I quickly set off for S\xF8rv\xE1gsvatn, known for its optical illusion-like cliffs\
  \ that make the lake appear higher than sea level than it actually is. The next\
  \ day, I explored the further reaches of the islands, from the tiny village Saksun,\
  \ to the gorgeous coast of Gjogv, & then the iconic Mulafossur waterfall. On the\
  \ last day, I took my first ever helicopter ride & later enjoyed some local seafood\
  \ from Barbara, a popular spot in T\xF3rshavn. \n\nThe end came too soon, but I\
  \ felt so refreshed & ready to get back & tackle life in LA. It really does something\
  \ to you when your only agenda for days is to look for & revel in beauty. But beauty\
  \ is all around, even at home. It\u2019s so often that light shines brightest in\
  \ the dark, & perhaps the sobering awareness that comes with suffering is in fact\
  \ what heightens beauty\u2019s sweetness wherever it can be found.\n\nVideo: www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8-A4eIHVD0&t="
