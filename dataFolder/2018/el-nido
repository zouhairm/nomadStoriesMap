Text: "I am up to my ankles in sewage.\n\nI\u2019m in El Nido, Philippines, quite\
  \ possibly the most beautiful place on earth: towering cliffs, deep turquoise waters,\
  \ white sand lagoons. This is hard to appreciate, however, because I am standing\
  \ in foul, grey sewage.\n\nMy friend Katie and I are in the Philippines. We spent\
  \ the afternoon rocketing around the countryside on a scooter and taste-testing\
  \ every Filipino potato chip flavour we could find. All in all, a successful day.\
  \ A few hours after going to bed, however, I awoke to Katie vomiting. I tried to\
  \ help, but could do nothing. I spent the night in a listless sleep-wake limbo,\
  \ drifting between reality and disturbing dreams as Katie retched and groaned.\n\
  \nIn the morning we headed to the town clinic. Inside the cramped, one-room medical\
  \ centre I felt the curious eyes of about ten local Filipinos. Eventually the doctor\
  \ offered us a private room, a privilege none of the locals were granted. She examined\
  \ Katie, and I (having felt rather useless up until now) offered to go retrieve\
  \ Katie\u2019s prescriptions and withdraw cash to pay the medical bills. \n\nI headed\
  \ to the bank, only to find that the ATMs were out of cash. They were waiting for\
  \ a cash delivery, a guard told me, but no one knew when it would arrive. \nFlummoxed,\
  \ I hurried over to the pharmacy. The pharmacist rummaged around before shaking\
  \ her head. \n\u201CNothing,\u201D she apologized.\n\nI traipsed back to the clinic\
  \ empty-handed. As I turned a corner, I realized the entire block had been flooded\
  \ with dirty sewage. \nAt first I tried to pick my way through, gingerly placing\
  \ my feet on high ground, but eventually realized I had no choice but to plug my\
  \ nose, grit my teeth, and wade through the filth. \n\nAnd now I\u2019m standing\
  \ here, feet submerged, worrying about Katie, and realizing that for the first time\
  \ since getting here, I am encountering reality. Our travels had been wonderful,\
  \ but I hadn\u2019t experienced the true El Nido. The true El Nido is not just the\
  \ incredible beaches; it is so much more. It is the cash and medication shortages\
  \ that belay the country\u2019s infrastructure problems, and the faulty sewers that\
  \ need money and government action to fix. And it is the Filipinos who give a private\
  \ room to tourists, just to make us more comfortable.\n\nKatie recovered, and I\
  \ vowed to never mistake lounging and beaches for a true local connection. Travel\
  \ is to know the lives of others, to truly understand the realities of a foreign\
  \ place. I didn\u2019t do this in El Nido. But next time, I will."
