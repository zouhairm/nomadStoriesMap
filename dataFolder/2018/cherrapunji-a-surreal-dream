Text: "I have visited Meghalaya a few times, amidst clouds and waterfalls it was a\
  \ cave at Cherrapunji which captured my soul. Enroute I perceived  flow of time,\
  \ cold early Shillong sunrise, slightly warmer Mawkdow morning and a moist late\
  \ afternoon followed by rains in Cherrapunji. Coming from the heartland of India,\
  \ it was a cultural shock. The tribes of Meghalaya have a different social structure.\
  \ Long matrilineal tradition of Khasi tribe can be seen everywhere. Women on the\
  \ front desk of the shops wearing traditional \u2018dhara\u2019, a single cloth\
  \ across, tied on the right shoulder. These proud owners embrace a confident red\
  \ smile, stained with tamul, a chewing preparation made from areca nut in betel\
  \ leaf. They were the masters, traders of the hills. \n\nCherrapunji, a small town\
  \ with box-like houses and a pointy church has phonetics of a toddler\u2019s giggle.\
  \ My first introduction to the city was in school textbooks as the wettest place\
  \ on earth. On the contrary, the city was short of fresh water. The beautiful long\
  \ waterfalls  drains all the water away. Falling water appeared like white curtains\
  \ in a  green drawing room. The mist of clouds created mysticism. I sat silently\
  \  next to one the these falls with our voids aligned. All the wounds were washed\
  \ by heavy rains, healed by the serene.   \n\nA word from a friend headed me towards\
  \ Arwah Lumshynna Caves.The twin limestone caves sitting one after another were\
  \ believed to be adobe of ancestral spirits. The first one was well paved with artificial\
  \ light escorting throughout the trek, crowded with tourists. The other cave obscured\
  \ by the bushes was barely explored by the humans. My adventurous soul took a leap\
  \ and I found myself crawling across the cave, as if tracing  the gut of an ancient\
  \  town. Swallowed inside the dark, the moist smell of algae, echoes of my voice\
  \ enthralled me . A few unintentional patches of sunlight played hide and seek with\
  \ the cold  limestone. I was not lost like a bird in a womb of cloud. I was the\
  \ squirming termite inside the mound of unexplored earth. There were passages from\
  \ all directions and spaces with bats sleeping in solitude.  Guided by the headlight\
  \ I trekked, exploring how the rain would have flowed from centuries to form such\
  \ shapes. Their trails were glorified in the acute lime deposits. While coming out\
  \ of the cave I was awakened from a surreal dream. No wonder spirits are reluctant\
  \ to leave this cave. \n\nIn the expedition of clouds from land to sky and back\
  \ to waters I experienced a magic, a magic of perpetual time."
