Text: "In the situational space of a region, through dense metropolis to rural runoffs,\
  \ unexposed from our prior comfort is where we truly travel in space or time - believe\
  \ it or not. \n\nSet off, to have never been exposed to my venture ahead or set\
  \ off in the same light, in absence of companionship or former depth in knowledge\
  \ of Sri Lankan culture, anxiety has a presence - behind my travel suit (a primarily\
  \ yellow and blue Hawaiian short suit custom made in Indonesia). Landing into quick-paced\
  \ learning on currency, corruption, and keeping it cool - with it being myself.\
  \ We're away laughing!\n\nI tick them off - find known friends, explore previously\
  \ discovered regions - with known paths and familiar sights, tastes, and cultural\
  \ influences on the East coast of Sri Lanka in a town called Arugam Bay (where tourism\
  \ is budding uncontrollably). And then again set off on a path into my unknown,\
  \ a group of three, on three wheels, each with three bags, on their two knees -\
  \ Tuk-tuk, here we come! So I lied... for the phonetic symphony and metaphoric brilliance\
  \ of the word Tuk-tuk, as the following bus driver toots the horn.\n\nWe're on a\
  \ bus, on the wrong side of the road swerving back to dodge oncoming traffic - we've\
  \ all mentally defecated and lost our lives, however, still alive and well, although\
  \ sweaty, in a physical sense. We're happily thrown off, right where we asked to\
  \ get thrown off - in the middle of somewhere - unknown. Content, three hours of\
  \ true conscious living, parted with three dollars (The New Zealand Dollar), and\
  \ forgiven all prior grudges or negative deeds done upon me - we traveled. \n\n\
  We jump in two tuk-tuks, and head to the ashram (Traditionally, an ashram is a spiritual\
  \ hermitage) on the very outskirts of a National Forrest. I'm blown away by the\
  \ sincerity of greeting, hospitality - with flowing tea, rice, and curry, and heat\
  \ as we settle in the mud-built house! We offload in our open raised hut, settled!\n\
  \nNightfalls after an adventure up to a temple on top of a hill, seemingly with\
  \ it falls known reality and comfort. With the world once in walking distance, we\
  \ walk back to the Ashram then onwards to a friends house, closer to the edge of\
  \ the jungle. A night, arrack (coconut rum), sincere humans, food, and culture to\
  \ remember. \n\n\"You come back, you bring a girl, you stay my house, we go jungle!\"\
  \ - was repeated to me throughout the night and as we departed, myself anxious not\
  \ to run into a leopard with a drunken leader on the border of no man's land!"
