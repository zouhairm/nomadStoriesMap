Text: "Historical places, architectural contrasts, an efficient public transportation,\
  \ and a mix of cultures in just 59.5km2. The cosmopolitan district of Manhattan\
  \ is one of the most important places when thinking in New York. Why? Because it\
  \ has everything!. As soon as I was in the \u201Cmust see\u201D spots: The Brooklyn\
  \ Bridge, Times Square and Central Park, I could feel a special connection with\
  \ everyone.\n\nLet\u2019s start with one of the most iconics places talking about\
  \ architecture. An historical bridge that connect Brooklyn district with Manhattan\
  \ district: The Brooklyn Bridge. After fourteen years of construction, it was opened\
  \ in 1883. An interesting fact is that at least twenty people died during it construction.\
  \ One of the first people to die was the designer of the bridge his name was John\
  \ Augustus Rowling. Definitely is a must stop in New York.  Just imagine yourself\
  \ riding a bike during sunset or crossing the bridge by walking at afternoon-night\
  \ while see the illuminated Manhattan's buildings and skyscrapers. I promise you,\
  \ it would be unforgettable.\n\nNow is time to talk about Time Square I am 90% sure\
  \ that at least one time in your life you have seen it in a movie scene; this iconic\
  \ spot is full of stores, lights, restaurants, huge-flashing-billboards, art on\
  \ the streets,  bars, and more neon lights. If I have to describe Times Square in\
  \ one word, I would say brilliant. Simply put, being here feels like you being part\
  \ of a movie (at least to me) trust me, there are not excuses for not visiting this\
  \ spot. \n\nFinally, Central Park! three words: Lovely, Big and Free. Basically\
  \ you will need almost a full day to discover and explore it. Probably you are going\
  \ to walk a lot, but trust me nothing matters when you are there. Metaphorically\
  \ I can say there is another city inside of Central park so take the map, fit in\
  \ sneakers, fill your water bottle and let's discover these beautiful spots: Shakespeare\
  \ Garden, The Lake, Turtle Pond, Strawberry Field, my favorite Belvedere Castle\
  \ and among others. You will love them. \n\n    Manhattan is a wonderful place to\
  \ visit, it is one of my favorites places in US. You will never being boring because\
  \ it has something for everyone: art, ecology, entertainment, shopping, culture;\
  \ It does not matter what are you interested in, you will find it in here. Do not\
  \ worry to save \u201Cenough money\u201D to travel here, just do not forget to bring\
  \ with you the will to live the experience to discovering Manhattan. Let yourself\
  \ to feel the conecction."
