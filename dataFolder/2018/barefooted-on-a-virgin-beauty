Text: "Barefooted on a virgin beauty:\nA desire that drove me that far to the North-western\
  \ border of India, a place that the universe admires for its unparalleled beauty\
  \ and the border that naturally partitions two countries. So far there were shrubs\
  \ and stones in the way of my voyage, they were like bordering something precious\
  \ inside to protect the same. \nWith the first light of dawn I\u2019ve reached there\
  \ \u2013 \u2018Jaisalmer\u2019: A city banking \u2018The Great Indian Thar Desert\u2019\
  . It was like a portrait of several houses with a golden colour on them done by\
  \ an artist. A utopian without much trace of water. \nManu Singh (Local guide) says,\
  \ \"Bana are you ready to meet the Golden Princess?\u201D \u201CThe Golden Princess?\u201D\
  \ I asked. \u201CBana a nascent beauty that is still virgin on this Earth, waiting\
  \ for your footsteps for her rising\u201D, he said.\n\u201CLet\u2019s go,\u201D\
  \ I said, as Manu Singh was being poetic and I think he uses the same sentence for\
  \ every tourist. We started in our car and travelled till the end of roads until\
  \ the further travel was on Desert ships - the Rajasthani camels ornate in the traditional\
  \ minutes. A long sinuous ride on the desert ship, 'RAJA' - I named my camel.\n\
  It was a tedious two hours journey cornering the shrubs, bushes and stone mountains,\
  \ on RAJA\u2019s back. At a glimpse Manu Singh was ahead of me, he looked back and\
  \ smirked. RAJA was tied up with Manu Singh's camel, as Manu Singh pulled up his\
  \ camel's controlling probes and here RAJA ran along with Manu\u2019s camel. I was\
  \ shouting as RAJA's sinuous waves amplitude had increased and my butt on his back\
  \ was hitting like a contour on another.\nSuddenly, everything became smooth and\
  \ it was definitely a heaven symbolizing purity, an exclusivity in the royalness\
  \ that gives me the respect to be the first to touch her (sand). \nI went off RAJA\
  \ and removed my boots \u2013 It was like a generation of waiting to sooth my barefoot\
  \ by touching that sand. I forgot everything by that experience, it was a sense\
  \ of satisfaction that was above of all needs and desires. What I saw was tremendously\
  \ beautiful - \u2018A sunset at Thar\u2019, watching from the top of a sand dune\
  \ as the sun was descending vertically, the last light was the falling at the desert\u2019\
  s chest highlighting it as a raspberry and soon the light fade away. \nI bought\
  \ some sand in my pouch to remember those beautiful moments of love in life when\
  \ the overburden leads my life to feel worthless and in the time of quitting it\
  \ will give me a strength to Never give up."
