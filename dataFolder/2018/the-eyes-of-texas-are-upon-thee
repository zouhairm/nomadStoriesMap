Text: "The original road trip I\u2019d embarked upon left my companion and I stranded\
  \ in Verde Valley of Northern Arizona in a growing town called Cottonwood. To the\
  \ west of us, Mingus Mountain towered our location and provided shade as early as\
  \ 6 PM, but the sun still lit up the red rocks of Sedona which we could see across\
  \ the desert plains despite our distance that I could only calculate would be 20\
  \ minutes away by automobile. \n My companion- a red-headed Army-veteran who answered\
  \ to \u201CGinge\u201D- and I had originally settled into a cockroach-infested shack\
  \ on the edge of the Old Town subdivision and just past the one-horse-town of Clarkdale,\
  \ which sported a mechanic shop, a failing library, a police station, and two pub\
  \ & grubs. Apart from the quick-stop shop down the main drag, Clarkdale was mainly\
  \ used for gatherings in the park at the center of town where you\u2019d often find\
  \ a band playing the gazebo & a few midwestern families enjoying the festivities.\
  \ Otherwise, the place was often deserted.\n After a few months of introducing ourselves\
  \ to the locals and making acquaintances, I\u2019d gotten in good terms with a group\
  \ of people just about my age, and even developed a bit of a crush on a girl who\
  \ had been, at that time, involved with someone else. \n Her name was Staci, and\
  \ I was hopelessly infacuated with her eyes and smile, but experience had begged\
  \ me to leave it lie; she was trouble, old boy, and out here in the elements, far\
  \ from home, trouble was the last thing I needed.\n Of course, this didn\u2019t\
  \ prevent Staci & I from devouring a bottle of rum one night, packing our belongings,\
  \ jumping into my two-seated clunker I\u2019d named \u201CMatchbox Riot,\u201D and\
  \ hitting the road for Texas; her homestate. \n We were going to start a new life\
  \ together filled with romance, ambition, and each other, and nothing was going\
  \ to stand in our way.\n Of course, after an hour and a half, during which time\
  \ my car\u2019s screams had taken on a gut-wrenching pitch, an explosion under the\
  \ hood left us crawling for the next exit at a snail\u2019s pace, and we found a\
  \ peaceful neighborhood to pull over and rest until morning. \n We cuddled for warmth\
  \ and when daylight set in, we drove aimlessly looking for a Mechanic.\n Our surroundings\
  \ slowly took on flat desert plains rather than houses, and it was there my car\
  \ and phone had died simultaneously.\n Our romantic getaway had turned into a nasty\
  \ debacle with overtones of life-threatening hurdles, not to mention the boyfriend\
  \ who\u2019d started his search for his beloved."
