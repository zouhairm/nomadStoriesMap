Text: "It is about the time when I woke up to the starry skies of the Milky Way on\
  \ a very cold night amidst the Himalayan range all covered in a white blanket that\
  \ made me realize the power of the decisions we make.\n\nThe Himalayas, one of the\
  \ most beautiful mountain range hides within itself a natural water moon shaped\
  \ lake also known as the Chanratal. One of the ways to reach this remote location\
  \ is to travel through various dangerous bumpy zigzag roads surrounded by the mountain\
  \ range on one side and by the Sutlej River flowing in the length of the road on\
  \ the other. On the way to reach the lake there are few villages all of them have\
  \ picturesque locations, beautiful apple gardens, surrounded by lush green forests,\
  \ stunning wooden carvings on the houses and elegant Tibetan timber carvings on\
  \ the temples. One has to see it to believe it. There are monasteries which are\
  \ the oldest operating enclave both in India and in the Himalayas, having numerous\
  \ mural paintings depicting the tales of the pantheon. And the last stop before\
  \ reaching the lake is the Kunzum pass which offers a 360 degrees view of the Bara-Shigri\
  \ glaciers which is the second longest glacier in the world. It is mandatory for\
  \ all the travelers to visit the Kunzum Devi temple there to pay their respects\
  \ and seek the blessings to travel through the rugged terrain safely. The temple\
  \ is also a Buddhist style Gompa covered with hundreds of colorful prayer flags\
  \ as seen on the monasteries, which are also believed to shoo the evil spirits away.\n\
  \nThe lake lies in between the snow-capped mountain ranges, dense forests all around\
  \ and open fields just before you can see the lake. It is spread in a radius of\
  \ 3Kms. It is believed the lake is pot shaped and no one has been able to measure\
  \ it\u2019s depth till date. It had jaw dropping view and the way the lake changed\
  \ its color according to the sky cannot be described in just plain words. The silence\
  \ of the lake, the sound of the water kissing the stones, the chirps of the birds,\
  \ the rustling of the leaves is a sight to behold. The night skies are painting\
  \ the dark and endless canvas with the Milky Way and various other constellations,\
  \ with some additional splashes of surprises by a few shooting stars every now and\
  \ then.\n\nJourneys like these far from the chaotic city life make us realize how\
  \ small a part we are of the whole universe and the various mysterious ways the\
  \ nature work. Knowing if we are once smitten by nature and bitten by the travel\
  \ bug there is no cure."
