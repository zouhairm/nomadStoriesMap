Text: "Ridiculously small. The slice of cake the waitress just left on our table seems\
  \ lost in the big porcelain dish. A meagre amount of red jam had been tossed on\
  \ top of it and a sad looking mint leaf completes this arguably fancy dessert. I\
  \ sight, \u201CWe\u2019re paying 15 dollars for something I could eat in two bites.\
  \ Do you know how many Kit Kat I could buy for 15 dollars?\u201D I tell my sister\n\
  \nShe lifts up her tired eyes and lets out an approving noise. For the last twenty\
  \ minutes she has been hunched over the table, trying to find a better position\
  \ to accommodate her sore bum. I would do the same but my body is so worn out that\
  \ for once I am sitting still. I offer her some of the cake but she refuses weakly\
  \ and so I start digging. I barely notice the few looks of annoyance people are\
  \ throwing our way. The irritation we are causing is unavoidable as the Carey\u2019\
  s Viking House is the only place still serving food at this hour in the tiny seaside\
  \ village of Kincasslagh and we were clearly underdressed for the place, wearing\
  \ yoga pants and old sweaters, bruises and dark stains of oil covering our skin.\
  \ \n\nWe had been travelling for nearly two weeks with our trusty bikes as only\
  \ mean of transportation, charged with heavy bags loaded with too many clothes.\
  \ Neither of us were equipped for a trip like this one; my sister had bought her\
  \ bicycle merely a week before leaving but a single look at the rental fees for\
  \ cars when under the age of 25 and we suddenly became fervent bike connoisseurs.\
  \ \n\nWe had left Letterkenny the same morning and cycled for 60km. This was not\
  \ something our training on flat and cemented bike paths could have prepared us\
  \ for. An hour in the Glenveagh National Park and the cold air had completely numb\
  \ my bare fingers, adding to that a fine rain battering our faces and a strong unruly\
  \ wind forcing us to lower our gaze. After a while it became evident that the wind\
  \ wasn\u2019t the only reason for my struggling. As I sang a song of my own, made\
  \ up of swear words, I began to notice my front tire deflating. Fighting to stop\
  \ the tears from falling and evidently failing in my case, it took us twice as long\
  \ as Google Maps said it would to reach the B&B but we finally arrived late in the\
  \ evening to the isolated town surrounded by rocky dirt roads that would make it\
  \ so difficult to leave the next day. It is that night that I learned how rewarding\
  \ being pushed to the edge and coming back from it could be but most of all it became\
  \ a day that I could never forget."
