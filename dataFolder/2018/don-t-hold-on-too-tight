Text: "On January 3, 2017, I landed in Lilongwe, Malawi to begin my next 6 months\
  \ of volunteering. I had just spent 2 months in Porto Alegre, Brazil and was eager\
  \ to explore another wonderful country and to meet the locals. Expecting the country\
  \ to have limited trees and to be mainly dirt I was delightfully surprised to discover\
  \ it to be extraordinary lush and filled with agriculture. It filled my heart as\
  \ it was an instant reminder of home (Vancouver Island, Canada). I had read that\
  \ Malawi was one of the poorest countries in the world and I felt I had prepared\
  \ myself for the culture shock I was about to experience, but I was not prepared\
  \ at all. I was not ready for police to be walking the street with riffles, the\
  \ homeless to have rotting feet and no teeth. It was a very different reality than\
  \ my comfortable Canadian lifestyle. \n\nMy perspective changed on these people,\
  \ unfortunately, I found myself holding my purse tighter and making sure I had an\
  \ easy escape at all times. I hated that my perspective on these people changed\
  \ so drastically and so quickly. I needed myself to realize that these people are\
  \ just like individuals back home, just in a worse off scenario. I forced myself\
  \ to open up to these individuals and discover who they were. And I discovered something\
  \ absolutely wonderful and unexpected. They are the most caring and genuine people\
  \ I had ever met. With so much joy and happiness, despite having very little. When\
  \ I attended church with them they were so welcoming and were teaching me the songs\
  \ in order to sing along. They always went out of their way to show me their culture\
  \ and their way of life. Yes, they want a better life and to have running water\
  \ and electricity but they are also happy with what they have and feel blessed to\
  \ not starve the following day. They have found peace in a life that many people\
  \ could not survive. \n\nHonestly, Malawi was the last place I expected to change\
  \ my perspective so quickly and so wonderfully. I have always been open-minded about\
  \ individuals no matter their gender, race, ethnic identity, or their financial\
  \ stability. But these individuals helped me realize that even if you have so little,\
  \ you can have so much with the right attitude."
