Text: "When I moved to NY for studies, the culture shock really came like that - a\
  \ shock. The place, food, lifestyle were very familiar, exciting and easy. But the\
  \ people were a different ballgame. Soon I met someone who felt like The One. He\
  \ talked marriage and family, but I travelled a lot for work and pleasure and we\
  \ parted. I drowned myself in work and liquid lunches with girlfriends. Time passed,\
  \ slowly. Winter came and I made like the birds and flew South.\nI went home to\
  \ India and randomly planned made a trip with a travel buddy. We often travelled\
  \ together on a whim and this time we picked Maldives. One of the reasons we picked\
  \ that place was because it didn't have cumbersome visa processes and we could leave\
  \ within a week (Note to Govts: Calm down on the paperwork please). Another reason\
  \ was that I'm paranoid about climate change. So I wanted to see Maldives, Great\
  \ Barrier Reef etc before climate change ruins them. I am a beach person and travelling\
  \ is my favourite form of therapy. Though I was travelling with this friend, it\
  \ ended up being a solo trip because he was newly in love and was on Whatsapp with\
  \ his paramour the whole time. \nI was a novice diver at the time but it's Maldives.\
  \ So I booked a dive, by myself. A Dhoni took me far into the Indian Ocean. I plopped\
  \ backwards into the salty, green ocean. Instincts from the womb kicked in and I\
  \ found rhythm with the water immediately. Fish and reefs of all colors surrounded\
  \ me and then, as if the school of fish parted, I saw a shark. I was told I might\
  \ see one but seeing it for real, was unreal. And then, I saw another. Later I was\
  \ told they were 2m long Shark babies. But a few feet from them, they didn't feel\
  \ like babies at all! I can't be sure but I feel like I didn't breathe for several\
  \ seconds. Not out of fear but in awe. They swam by me, utterly disinterested and\
  \ very uncooperative with my GoPro. When the dive was over, I was gestured to swim\
  \ up. As I swam up to the surface, it seemed like with every inch my exoskeletons\
  \ of grief and hurt were being shed as easily as unzipping out of a bodysuit. By\
  \ the time I broke the surface I felt several pounds lighter and brighter. \nTravelling\
  \ has always been my favourite form of therapy, and while cocktails and dancing\
  \ with friends are amazing, I recommend swimming with sharks more.\n\nIn case you\
  \ were wondering, my friend married that girl and they recently celebrated their\
  \ 3rd anniversary. Go love!"
