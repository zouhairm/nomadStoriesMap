Text: "Surely many of you have heard, experienced or read about the wonders offered\
  \ to anyone who visits Barcelona. I did my research before traveling to the famous\
  \ Gaudi city,  yet, I did not expect to find that many shades in one single place\
  \ and to fall deeply in love with each one of them. When I arrived to Barcelona,\
  \ I felt the same butterflies that you feel when seeing the one you like; there\
  \ was something about the landing that made my stomach crunch with anxiety; maybe\
  \ it was that I spotted the beach bounded by antique buildings while the plane did\
  \ a round to get to the airport. Then, the bus driving me to my final destination\
  \ showed me the places I dreamed to see when I was planning my trip. That was the\
  \ moment when I realized that Barcelona is not just about the stunning Sagrada Familia\
  \ Church or the enchanting Ramblas. Getting to know the most iconic places of Barcelona\
  \ made me remind when you first met the person you like; you see the eyes, the smile;\
  \ the physical things and though those things are what attracts you,  what makes\
  \ you fall in love is so much more. \n\nBarcelona flirts through little hidden spots\
  \ branded with wonderful smells, stores that invite you to shop things that you\
  \ did not even know you wanted and people with one of the most beautiful accents\
  \ in the world inviting you to share \u201Ctapas and sangria\u201D. Every street\
  \ is so different to the other and as you walk by, you may listen a small jazz group\
  \ and then watch a live street Spanish rock performance. Those little details wrap\
  \ you and win you over, attaching you to every corner of this old town surrounded\
  \ by the Mediterranean Sea that vibrates with an independent Catalonian spirit but\
  \ at the same time makes you learn a lot about Spanish history. The last thing I\
  \ expected when visiting Barcelona was that I was going to move to this city of\
  \ adventure, romantic encounters, best food in the world-and that is saying much\
  \ coming from a Colombian woman-, but the heart wants what it wants and when you\
  \ fall in love, you stick around."
