Text: "Shortly after my 21st birthday, I decided to visit my extended family in Texas\
  \ \u2013 including my uncle and auntie, and my cousins and grandcousins.  I had\
  \ planned to visit earlier but realised my passport had expired, and so I stalled\
  \ my booking and went to my nearest passport office in Liverpool (England), where\
  \ I paid a higher price to expedite the passport renewal process.  The last thing\
  \ I expected was for Eyjafjallaj\xF6kull (an Icelandic volcano) to erupt and cause\
  \ major transatlantic airline disruptions.  \n\nDespite this freak incident, I caught\
  \ my indirect flight, which was consequently running two hours behind schedule due\
  \ to lingering ash cloud in the sky, and left my hometown of Manchester (UK) on\
  \ 18th April 2010.  I was supposed to arrive at my first connecting airport in Newark\
  \ (EWR) at around 6pm EST yet, because this flight was already delayed by two hours\
  \ with an added hour of refuelling towards the end of the journey \u2013 which involved\
  \ circling in the air for a nauseating 30 minutes (well, I was sick anyway) to get\
  \ rid of excess fuel before landing, refuelling, and taking off again from an army\
  \ base in New Jersey, I arrived at Newark slightly after 9pm EST i.e. too late for\
  \ my 9pm connecting flight to Houston.  The airline apologised and could only offer\
  \ me the next available flight (5am EST) so, as this was my first time travelling\
  \ solo, I decided to wait around the airport until the next flight \u2013 I was\
  \ a bit flustered initially, I rang my Texan family in a panic to update them, but\
  \ slowly the angst subsided; I had learnt a valuable lesson, namely, that life does\
  \ not always work out the way we expect it to.  I whiled away the hours by exploring\
  \ the airport, purchasing food, talking to one of the migrant cleaners in the airport,\
  \ and getting some sleep (though lying awkwardly across rows of chairs with armrests\
  \ was not very comfortable!)\n\nEventually, I checked onto the red eye flight to\
  \ Houston (IAH), whereupon I boarded my final connecting flight to College Station\
  \ (CLL) \u2013 and my auntie and uncle picked me up around noon.  From then on my\
  \ three week trip was perfect, I witnessed many wondrous sights, such as: a baby\
  \ vulture in my auntie and uncle\u2019s back garden; Texan university campuses;\
  \ my first ever baseball game in Arlington; a modern day speakeasy and a honky tonk\
  \ bar in Austin; the Houston Space Center, and (my favourite) the San Antonio Riverwalk.\
  \  I had a fantastic time with my family, who I rarely get to see, for which I am\
  \ forever thankful."
