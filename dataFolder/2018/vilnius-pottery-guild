Text: "Vilnius is like the backdrop of a childhood fairytale, mystical yet familiar.\
  \ Walking its streets will fill anyone with wonder and nostalgia as faded stone\
  \ walls and weathered window sills frame each structure within its old town. The\
  \ most notably distinct neighborhood within old town is U\u017Eupis, the art district,\
  \ where walls are rarely left uncovered by graffiti or murals. The artistic inhabitants\
  \ felt the neighborhood was so distinct that they declared it as an independent\
  \ republic in 1997. To experience the true U\u017Eupis, I decided to create among\
  \ its artists by joining the Vilnius Pottery Guild for a class. Without any initiation\
  \ process of secret handshakes, I was welcomed to the guild. The earthiness from\
  \ the clay floats in the air and walls covered by past pottery pieces enclose the\
  \ space. The class begins with Laura, the instructor, putting on a kettle for tea\
  \ and its participants finding cups they\u2019ve made from the display shelves.\
  \ As the tea-sipping begins, the studio\u2019s black Labrador takes his spot on\
  \ a checkered blanket and dozes in and out of a nap, providing a rhythmic soundtrack\
  \ to the class. Each person begins with a slab of deep olive colored clay on a wooden\
  \ board and forms out the desired design with their hands. As the clay pieces soften\
  \ and take on its new shape, each participant chimes in with their own weekly updates\
  \ regarding their pottery goals and life. Most of the guild members are not full-time\
  \ artists and work office jobs, they use pottery to connect back to their artistic\
  \ childhoods and Lithuanian roots. While Lithuanian handmade pottery has been linked\
  \ Narva culture as early as seven thousand years ago, the guild members are using\
  \ the ancient technic in new ways. Some are ambitiously attempting to create a whole\
  \ dining set while others are making small decorative pieces but when answering\
  \ the question of what they are making, almost all the members are letting the clay\
  \ be what it wants to be as they freehand each piece. Instructors like Laura have\
  \ made everything from jewelry to flutes, which are displayed in the gallery. Regardless\
  \ of skill level or walk of life, all members share their creations and thoughts\
  \ openly. The guild\u2019s openness and inclusion are vital values that are shared\
  \ within the republic. Anyone can come to U\u017Eupis to be themselves and to feel\
  \ free. I came into U\u017Eupis and got to be carefree in a fairy-tale setting and\
  \ created a souvenir that brings back the Vilnius spirit every time I take a sip\
  \ of tea."
