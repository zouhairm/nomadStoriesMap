Text: "When someone tells me it\u2018s impossible then I just have to give it a go.\n\
  \nAn armed guard boarded the bus at the checkpoint, and the conductor unhesitatingly\
  \ pointed at me. A gentleman in a pink shirt told me he honoured me and my country,\
  \ was grateful I was visiting India, but I would not be visiting the ship breaking\
  \ yards at Alang.  All this before I had uttered a word.\n\nThe approach road flanked\
  \ by stalls displayed the spoils of an occupation whose world-wide exposure as dangerous\
  \ and exploitative by well meaning eco groups had made visiting, let alone photographing,\
  \ nigh on impossible.  Life jackets, life belts, mirrors, sofas and cutlery, were\
  \ there for the connoisseur.  \n\nA rickshaw was hailed with the words \u201Cmadam\
  \ should return to town\u201D. I explained I was disappointed and needed time to\
  \ absorb what I had been told.  I entered the hut, was offered a seat, handed a\
  \ glass of chai, and asked if I had drinking water.  My companions went about their\
  \ business, casting glances in my direction, but offered nothing in the way of encouragement.\
  \  I pleaded with them, asked if we could \u2018phone their head office for an eleventh\
  \ hour permission, but nothing doing.\n\nI was allowed outside for some fresh air\
  \ on the proviso I left my camera inside The armed guard, accompanied me. In the\
  \ distance a cruise ship\u2019s white superstructure taunted me.  I shed tears of\
  \ disappointment \u2013 so near yet so far.  The guard gestured to my tissue and\
  \ I handed him a clean one.  Throwing it on the ground he held his hand out for\
  \ the one I had used !  Not since I had blown my nose into it \u2013 I declined\
  \ -  it wouldn\u2019t have been a welcome souvenir.\n\nRe-entering the hut, I saw\
  \ that a cellophane wrapped bouquet of fresh flowers had appeared in this most unlikely\
  \ of places.  Brushing away the dust, a middle-aged gentleman bashfully presented\
  \ it to me.\n\nIn the light of this unexpected development which heralded an end\
  \ to hospitality, I accepted it was time to withdraw graciously and when a bus drew\
  \ up I boarded, returning to Bhavnagar, my unexpected gift cradled on my lap.\n\n\
  At my accommodation the receptionist wanted to know how I had fared.  \u201CYou\
  \ were right\u201D, I said,\u201D they didn\u2019t let me in\u201D, then taking\
  \ the flowers from behind my back, \u201Cbut they gave me these\u201D. \n\nWe agreed\
  \ this was an unexpected compensation and when I left the following day, a water\
  \ bottle of flowers remained outside my room; bitter sweet testament to yet another\
  \ disappointed photographer."
