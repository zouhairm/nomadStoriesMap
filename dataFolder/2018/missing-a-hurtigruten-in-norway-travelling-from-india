Text: "It was the month of February 2018, I was travelling from Svolvaer to Finnsness\
  \ in Norway, slept at 1am last night, dead tired, maybe was dreaming about the northern\
  \ lights. I woke up, having no idea about the time and place, saw the ship stationary,\
  \ asked one of the crew about the name of the port, took my passport, purse and\
  \ the camera, and went downstairs to get off the ship. One crew scanned my card\
  \ that was given by the ship authority, and informed me about the timings, when\
  \ the boat would sail again and so on, I heard with my still not-out-of-the-dream\
  \ state, and went outside into the cold. It was a very beautiful place, the port\
  \ of Harstad, the crew said, the name that I studied in numerous blogs I read before\
  \ started for this trip but had no idea that I could actually be there. So, there\
  \ I was, with all my luggage on the ship, taking photographs in a place that never\
  \ existed in my itinerary, with only some time left after which the ship would sail.\
  \ \nI was walking by the harbor and just when I decided to return to the ship, I\
  \ saw a galleon which I have only seen in the story books or in the movies like\
  \ the Pirates of the Caribbean, with all it's lights ablaze, coming from distant\
  \ blue waters, with the blue snowy mountains behind it. It was like a blazing flame\
  \ in the cool landscape. Only seeing it, I realized that I was unable to go to the\
  \ ship which would be sailing shortly, instead, I went on towards the end of the\
  \ harbor where I could get a closer view of that galleon. And yes, I took some photos\
  \ too. After maybe 5 minutes, that seemed like 5 seconds, I started for the ship,\
  \ I was running and I slipped in the hard ice. I fell in the road and again got\
  \ up in no time, but I could sense that I am getting very late.\nWhat's more, I\
  \ had my phone set in Indian time, with no network! So, I didn't know the exact\
  \ local time, without any contacts, great! I remembered hearing that crew about\
  \ the ship leaving the harbor 10 mins prior to the actual departure time if there\
  \ was another ship coming to the port. I hoped I remembered wrong considering my\
  \ dreamy state then. My only hope was that card scanner that would inform them about\
  \ my absence on board. \nI reached the port and I was 5 minutes too late! The ship\
  \ has already sailed and was within a long jumper's jumping distance! I don't know\
  \ what I would have done if I did not have my camera and passport with me. I waived,\
  \ and they waived back! Nothing worked, they didn't come back. I watched the ship\
  \ leaving."
