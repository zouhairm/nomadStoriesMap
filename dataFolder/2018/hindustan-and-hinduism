Text: Recently i visit himachal and suddenly i felt that mountains are the best part
  of taught something like we should always stick to our passion and never be afraid
  any kind of storm coming into our life because nothing last forever and when we
  faces the problem and get through out of it thats called life, when i start tracking
  i learned another thing about life that life is full of ups and down and when you
  pass all of this with full of confidence than you found a new life with new begginings
  and new hopes also and after that you never disappointed with yourself. I must say
  everyone travel a new place every year for your better future and well being. I
  am from india and belive me india is the most beautiful country in the universe
  with full or color, religion, festivals and lots of thing, if you luv history than
  you must visit india because india have deepest and courageous history. In my point
  of view you travel any city, country and place but once in a year you have to move
  on another city for sometime for your mind refreshment and after that you do your
  work with more enthusiasm.
