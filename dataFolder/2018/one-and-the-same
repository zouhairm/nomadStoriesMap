Text: "As I stepped out into the bright sunlight, the chill of the airport and the\
  \ winter I had left behind in North Carolina was chased away. It was the kind of\
  \ warmth that you find in your car on a hot summer's day. I felt it deep within\
  \ my bones and welcomed it after a long winter that I would return to soon enough.\
  \ 23 of us had volunteered from the school to travel to Panama on a Global Brigades\
  \ program. We had another 4 hours of travel to go -- a bumpy bus ride south along\
  \ mostly paved roads. We headed deep into Panama's Darien Province, to work with\
  \ the indigenous  Embara Indians  on reforestation and sustainable farming practices.\
  \ As I looked around I saw nothing but smiles. We were all in that Panamanian haze\
  \ of happiness -- although, that could have been the heat making us delirious. \n\
  Full of curiosity, I talked with our local brigade leaders along the way to learn\
  \ as much as I could about the Panamanian culture. There was a slight language barrier\
  \ between some of the locals and myself, but I wouldn\u2019t let that stop me. Frank\
  \ was always making jokes and even though I understood none of it, his laugh was\
  \ infectious. He was a jolly guy with a smile that reached his eyes. I could tell\
  \ he would be my favorite.\nEvery day we  hiked a half mile up a mountain to plant\
  \ coffee plants and banana trees. On the first day, they asked for a volunteer and\
  \ I overeagerly obliged with no knowledge of the job. I got to hold the rope that\
  \ marked a straight line through the fields and talk to Frank. If you ask me, I\
  \ got the better end of the deal. Frank spoke very little English and I spoke very\
  \ little Spanish, but we found a way to joke with each other throughout the day.\
  \ It was easy to break the language barrier I had feared when I arrived. We talked\
  \ about simple things at first but soon we fell into an easy pattern. We understood\
  \ one another well enough and he told me about life growing up in Panama and asked\
  \ me about things in the United States. We talked of music and he shared some  from\
  \ Panama. I nodded my head along to the groove of the beat, I could definitely listen\
  \ to this!\nOver the course of the next two weeks, I began to know Panama for it's\
  \ sounds: birds, howling monkeys, and Frank's laughter. Frank and I talked every\
  \ day and over time we began to really know and understand each other. Despite our\
  \ obvious differences, we were one and the same. We live our lives for happiness\
  \ and that's all we really need."
