Text: "A trip to Mount Etna on the Eastern side of Sicily checked an item off the\
  \ bucket list. You can easily find self guided tours and hiking trips on the mountain\
  \ or you can skip the line by purchasing tickets ahead of time (Sicilying.com).\
  \  The option we chose was a package that included a cable car to reach 2504 meters\
  \ and then an off road style bus to take us even further into the sky at 2920 meters\
  \ at a preselected time (79\u20AC).\n \nThe Funivia d\u2019Etna glides up the side\
  \ of Europe\u2019s largest active volcano and the plants start to turn from small\
  \ shrubs, to moss and then a rocky landscape that looks like you are on another\
  \ planet. A chalet at the top is filled with provisions, souvenirs and a place to\
  \ rent some warm parkas. As a tough Canadian, I said I did not need the rental.\
  \ At their insistence I took it anyway, a decision I did not regret.\n \nThe vehicles\
  \ navigated their way up winding roads with a lunar landscape visible out the windows.\
  \ I stepped out of the bus onto dark black soil, it was cold and the wind was strong.\
  \ A dedicated mountain guide greeted the bus and led us around a group of craters\
  \ rhyming off facts about the incredible mountain in three languages. The volcanic\
  \ soil and stones are an incredible mix of magnesium, sodium and iron. A volcano\
  \ doesn\u2019t erupt from the same place twice. Each time it erupts a new crater\
  \ is created.\n \nThe higher we got the stronger the wind became and the air was\
  \ thin. I consider myself to be outdoorsy and enjoy a challenge but the hill became\
  \ steep and with each step your foot slid backwards, like walking in the snow. It\
  \ probably was\nnot as steep as I thought, but it felt like I was going to be blown\
  \ off the side of the mountain. A large rock halfway up provided me with a spot\
  \ to sit and contemplate my choices. I couldn\u2019t believe I had chosen to go\
  \ up a volcano. I had been so excited but now I was so scared and didn\u2019t feel\
  \ like I could move. Here\u2019s the thing about that, I had no choice, there was\
  \ no other way down. My dad leaned down to me and asked if I was ok. I admitted\
  \ to him that I was terrified, to which he whispered to me \u201Cme too\u201D and\
  \ grabbed my arm helped me up and we walked it together. Not much further along\
  \ the path, we reached the highest point we would get to. We did it, we were on\
  \ top of the world!  Well near the top of Mount Etna anyways. The view of the coast\
  \ of Sicily was breathtaking, it was not just the thin air, it was an unforgettable\
  \ moment."
