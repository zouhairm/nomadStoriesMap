Text: "I sat in the terminal of Narita Airport after 4 days in Tokyo staring at my\
  \ phone wondering whether to hit send on an email that would signal the next step\
  \ for my life. I was still amazed at how this monumental event occurred during my\
  \ relaxing holiday. \n\nI had been worked to the brinks of collapse which had resulted\
  \ me in having to take my remaining statutory 20 days of holiday in one swoop. I\
  \ had interviewed for a few new jobs with little or no response so I took this trip\
  \ to take some time off and do the cliched soul-searching as a mythical solo backpacker-traveller.\
  \ \n\nMy first stop: a capsule hostel with heated toilet seats (it was the most\
  \ luxurious hostel I have ever stayed in).\n\nSecond stop: food \u2013 I had a surprisingly\
  \ cheap Gyu-Don (rice topped with vegetables, grilled pork slices and a soft boiled\
  \ egg).\n\nI immediately went back to the hostel to rest and wake up early to get\
  \ the Odakyu train from Shinjuku station to Fujisawa to take the historic Enoden\
  \ train to Enoshima and Kamakura. I was eager to chase the mythical view of Mount\
  \ Fuji. As I walked from the Enoshima station to the shoreline, I could feel the\
  \ beautiful sun and knew my chances were good. As I walked across the narrow bridge\
  \ to the island, I saw the beautifully symmetrical cone rising out of the horizon\
  \ topped off with snow that all of the travel pictures promised. It was just as\
  \ spectacular as described by countless people. \n\nIf I had arrived any later,\
  \ the clouds would have arrived and blocked my view. I returned to Tokyo realising\
  \ how each of my steps brought me to that bridge to allow me the immense pleasure\
  \ of seeing Mount Fuji. \n\nAs I finished my bowl of ramen in a shopping centre\
  \ below the glitzy lights of Shinjuku, I prepared to walk a fair distance to Shibuya\
  \ to see the famous crossing. I checked my emails and I saw an email from a job\
  \ I had interviewed for before leaving for my trip. I immediately called the recruiter\
  \ even though I would be paying through the nose for the privilege. \n\nAs I sat\
  \ in a generic restaurant of a global coffee shop chain, I watched people walking\
  \ by amongst the shining red, blue and green lights of Shibuya crossing. I started\
  \ wondering whether to accept this amazing job offer and all of the opportunities\
  \ it would bring so I started drafting my resignation letter.\n\nFor that brief\
  \ moment in time, I thought I was the king of the world, and even as life moves\
  \ on Tokyo will always carry that level of joy and elation for the rest of my life."
