Text: "Throwing a grenade right where I'm standing and jumping and praying is all\
  \ I want to do right now.\n\n13 years ago, on King\u2019s Day, I left Barcelona\
  \ with the wind whispering in my ears how wide and exuberant the world was. Back\
  \ then I didn\u2019t know I was a Nomad. Now I do.\nI would have taken my next step\
  \ earlier if it wasn't for my ex who is fundamentally a Farmer. As the two arms\
  \ of a clock, we are opposites that twice a day find each other at the same place.\
  \ We are like clockwork filling each other\u2019 spaces however sometimes the gap\
  \ is painfully distant as we point to completely opposite directions.\nAnd that\
  \ gap feeds an irrepressible tornado, a thunder inside my chest, a burning, itching\
  \ feeling of wanderlust.\n\nPainstakingly I've let years roll under my feet for\
  \ the greatness of family, marriage, commodities and an ordinary life. Blinded by\
  \ things that money can buy and finding solace in my ever changing job and moving\
  \ homes 8 times.\nBut quietening that feeling of tightness and littleness I have\
  \ month after month staying in the same place is driving me mad. \nMad at night\
  \ when the fire consumes my body and burns me from the inside. I wake up soaking\
  \ in the sweat that comes within. Clammy skin wrapping an uncontainable spill of\
  \ burning desire inside my chest. Speeding thoughts whizzing past my brain keep\
  \ me awake when the rest of the souls are sleeping and flood back into my mind the\
  \ second I wake up prematurely with the chilling sweats of my unsettled heart.\n\
  \nI'm exhausted.\n\nI do respect my body. It's all I've got from the start till\
  \ the end of my days. And it is screaming at me loud and clear. \n\nDo you think\
  \ I am brave? Selfish? Crazy? An Irresponsible mother? \nDo you wonder how can I\
  \ abandon everything and just go? Where do I get the courage to leave my comforts\
  \ and valuables and throw myself into the unknown of travelling alone? \n\nCan\u2019\
  t you see I don't have any other choice?\n\nDo you remember that mad, young love\
  \ that poisoned your heart and swept you off your feet burning you with the desire\
  \ of touching, kissing and sexing your lover until you fell asleep exhausted, empty\
  \ and bursting all at once?\nCould you ever stop that force of nature? Would you?\n\
  This is how I feel now. Unstoppable.\n\nI'm going away to SEE!!! Or else I'll wilt\
  \ and languish and there won\u2019t be Carmen anymore.\n\nI'm far from brave or\
  \ courageous. Yes I'm behaving selfishly: I'm bewitched by wanderlust. \nAnd I have\
  \ finally succumbed to it\u2026 it\u2019s a lust after all and I'm only human\u2026\
  \n\nSurrender"
