Text: "He is in his element. The bark of a tree, feel it, listen to it breathe. Low\
  \ frequencies, like breathing or heart beating, but not quite identifiable. He brushes\
  \ his hand to the next object, a bush that is flowering. He takes his index finger\
  \ and thumb and runs them over the buds, examining them, feeling the textures of\
  \ this earth. He looks up, watching limbs sway lightly in the gentle wind. Watching\
  \ the new growth take sprout. He continues on his journey further into the woods.\
  \ Birds sing their songs. He hears some rustling and immediately knows which direction\
  \ it comes from. He glances just a squirrel scavenging around for its winter's stash.\
  \ It pauses and looks up at him. They hold a gaze then the squirrel carries on its\
  \ merely way undisturbed. Bobby smiles and continues, eager to see more wildlife.\
  \ He watches the bird above him, flying from branch to branch. He hears more brush\
  \ rustling. He looks over to see a rabbit startled by his presence, like it didn't\
  \ even know Bobby was there. It hops off. A creek bed comes into view, water fills\
  \ the air around him. Silence of nature consumes all. So peaceful. So beautiful.\
  \ He sits down on a bed of plushy moss. Rubs his hands over it, petting it like\
  \ a fluffy dog. He finds a large snail shell and picks it up. He can see the trails\
  \ of animals that have come and past this resting place. He watches the water run\
  \ over the rocks, smoothing them out. It must have taken thousands of years for\
  \ these stones to come to this resting place. Where did they come from? How did\
  \ they get here? Maybe these thoughts are echoes within the forest. He wonders as\
  \ he watches a salamander climb on a rock. He examines the ripples in the creek.\
  \ He can see crawfish and minnows  life force pulsating, breathing and extending\
  \ into the air around their actual psychical bodies. Each, unique to its own. It\u2019\
  s almost magical. Dragonflies dance in the air and butterflies flutter across the\
  \ river on purple wild flowers. Sunlight cascades down to the forest floor. He is\
  \ still, just watching nature unfold in front of him. A doe begins to graze on the\
  \ plush vegetation by the creek, gets thirsty then wonders to the water's edge.\
  \ Swiveling her ears toward Bobby's direction, she is comfortable and un-threatened.\
  \ She drinks, pulls up her head with water dripping from her lips, and trout bounces\
  \ off deeper into the woods. Bobby smiles all along, taking it all in. The entire\
  \ time, running his thumb in a circular pattern around the grooves of the shell."
