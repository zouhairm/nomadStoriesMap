Text: "We reached a base village Dharamkot at one pm on first day of trip. We wanted\
  \ to start our trip by spending a night in the laps of Dhauladhar Mountain at a\
  \ place called Triund.\nGuard suggested to not go for night stay as snowfall had\
  \ started at the peak. We lied to him of having a confirm booking. We had a tent\
  \ pre-booking but; agent ditched us due to snowfall & apologized just a day before.\
  \ Fortunately, we got permission with life threatening instructions.\nIt was my\
  \ first Himalayan trek with high expectations but initial trail was quite normal.\
  \ I was unable to enjoy that moment & also worried about night stay. I kept walking\
  \ but; some decisions started pulling me back. 3 months ago, I left a job to bring\
  \ efficiency in achieving an important goal & planned this trip aiming double celebration.\
  \ Eventually I ended up with a failure in it & now I\u2019m a jobless too. Still,\
  \ I flew 2000 km from Pune & was going to spend my savings. \u201CDo I regret coming\
  \ here?\u201D I asked myself.\nMeanwhile; I saw a NGO group collecting garbage on\
  \ the route, I was impressed & moved ahead. There was a minimal waste but it was\
  \ easily detectable all around. I ignored couple of wrappers but felt shameful &\
  \ started to pick them up onward.\nAt the halfway, a small cafe \u2018Magic View\
  \ Point\u2019 located, the view was truly magical. Many hills covered with deodar\
  \ & rhododendron trees & besides them there was a tallest snow covered range of\
  \ Dhauladhar. Green Kangra valley with whitish strips spread like a sleeping bear\
  \ in front of us. 2 beautiful cities; McLeodGanj & Dharamshala can be explored from\
  \ bird\u2019s eye view. The noisy wind was blowing fast at a constant pace throughout.\
  \ I spotted a famous HPCA international cricket stadium of Dharmshala. I was feeling\
  \ better & excitement increased remarkably steep as 22 sharp curves present on the\
  \ last hour of that trek.\nCrossing last curve, I saw; 4 sides full of icy Dhauladhar\
  \ trying to prelude of heaven, 4 sides of Kangra valley tad lightening up by street-lights,\
  \ the Sun was spreading magical saffron shades over the ice carpet. It was my first\
  \ step on a snow covered land. \u201CIt\u2019s worth coming here & spend a night\
  \ or two\u201D a local guy said noticing my joy. Suddenly, I remembered a problem\
  \ of stay but; my friend Ajit reached the top first & managed to book a last room.\
  \ He was delighted & waved me in a relief, I just smiled trying to explore each\
  \ scene.\nI checked my pockets; full of rubbish which I cleared from the route while\
  \ reaching to the height of 2850 m."
