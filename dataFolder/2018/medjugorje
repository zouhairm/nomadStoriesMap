Text: "I TRAVELED TO MEDJUGORJE LAST YEAR AND I AM NOT THE MOST DEVOTED CHRISTIAN\
  \ PRACTITIONER. \nCOMING FROM THE MIDDLE EAST AND SPECIFICIALLY LEBANON, THE ONLY\
  \ ARAB COUNTRY WITH A CHRISTIAN PRESIDENT, I FELT A LOT OF CONNECTION BETWEEN OUR\
  \ COUNTRY AND MEDJUGORJE - IN FACT I CAME BACK WITH IDEAS OF IMPROVING OUR ECONOMY\
  \ LIKE THEY DID WITH \"RELIGIOUS TOURISM\". \n1- MEDJUJORJE WITH THE HELP OF THE\
  \ CHURCH COULD BE STRONGER AND LASTED IN THE MIDST OF WAR - JUST LIKE THE CHRISTIANS\
  \ IN LEBANON WHO FOUGHT FOR 20 YEARS TO STAY IN THE COUNTRY \n2- THE REGION AROUND\
  \ MEDJUGORGE IS NOT OF THE SAME RELIGION\n3- THE FAITH OF THE PEOPLE IN MEDJUGORJE\
  \ IS CONTAGIOUS AND MAKES YOU FEEL TRUE PEACE\n\nMOREOVER, THE ECONOMY IN MEDJUGORJE\
  \ SHIFTED FROM TOBACCO - TO SIMPLY RELIGIOUS TOURISM FROM HOTELS AND SOUVENIRS AND\
  \ MEDJUGORJE BECAME ONE OF THE MOST VISITED COUNTRY OF CHRISTIANS FROM ALL OVER\
  \ THE WORLD. \n\nEVEN THOUGH MANY PEOPLE CONSIDER MEDJUGORJE AS MISLEADING, WE CANNOT\
  \ DENY THE PEACE ALL THOSE WHO GO THERE FEEL, THE EX-DRUG ADDICTS SUCCESS INSPIRATIONAL\
  \ STORIES, AND THE NUMEROUS MIRACELS THAT HAPPEN THERE (WHETHER TRUE OR SIMPLY INDUCED\
  \ BY LAW OF ATTRACTION AND TRUE BELIEF) \n\nWHETHER WE THINK MEDJUGORJE IS CREDIBLE\
  \ OR NOT, WE CANNOT DENY THE FACT OF THE POSITIVES THERE. \n\nM"
