Text: "I can still remember how lost I felt. It had been a few years already, that\
  \ my entire life revolved around the idea of love. You see, love is the greatest\
  \ legacy I was given; love was my purpose in life. When I felt in love with him,\
  \ I thought I had found what I been missing my whole life. Until the inevitable\
  \ happened, until my lowest point, that is the moment I realized I needed out. The\
  \ first thing that crossed my mind was to travel. Traveling is my biggest passion;\
  \ traveling is what felt like home. A life without traveling simply didn't exist\
  \ in my mind. At that moment, it just made sense to go; somewhere, anywhere. I decided\
  \ to go to the one place dearest to my heart. The place where I felt in love, the\
  \ magical islands of Hawaii. Hawaii was home for me, I had lived there for three\
  \ years while in college; it was the place where I bloomed into the women I am now.\
  \ My intention was to go to a place that indisputably made me happy, but what happened\
  \ in those two mystical weeks changed my life forever.\n  When I was landing in\
  \ Oahu I felt the usual butterflies, as I saw the deep blue ocean surround those\
  \ colossus lively green mountains. I went to the my usual beach. Kaimanas beach\
  \ never disappointed when it came to sunsets. I immediately felt the warmth of aloha\
  \ spirit, as I ran into old friends, and before I knew it, we were hanging out in\
  \ the never ending night life of Waikiki. \n  The next day I embarked to the Big\
  \ Island, where I started to immerse in nature. Waiting into late night to sneak\
  \ into the trails of volcano, prove to be all worth it when I got to see lava so\
  \ close that I could hear the sizzling sound of the vibrant red stream. Mouneke'a\
  \ made my eyes cry when I saw the most magical sunset. The cold and high elevation\
  \ didn't matter; it truly felt like a dream literary being on top of the clouds.\
  \ \n  By the time I got to Maui, I was not the same person that left Texas. There\
  \ I got to experience endless roads of trees and waterfalls that spoke to my heart.\
  \ When I went in, completely nude, into the ocean of little beach, I felt completely\
  \ one with nature. I had countless amazing experiences. Time just flew by. It wasn't\
  \ until I was on my return flight, that I realize I had discovered the best love\
  \ I could ever ask for, self-love. It wasn't until then, I felt me again. I went\
  \ to Hawaii to have fun, and I came back with the peace my soul was missing; for\
  \ that I will always be grateful with the world , for blessing us with such nature\
  \ beauty."
