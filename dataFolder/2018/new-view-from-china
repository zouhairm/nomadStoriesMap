Text: 'It was my first time traveling along,my first time experiencing such adventures
  feeling.

  China, those five days in china gave me a life time lessons about how to puch myself
  to the eges of my potential,to think about life in a new positive way and how to
  make my soul , my body and mind connected in figuring my solutions and help my self
  to get throughout life''s closed doors.

  It was like illuminating my mind to see between the lines or what was for me ,like
  in those old and traditionnel streets where elderly peoples sitting and talking
  .sometimes just one old man or women doing nothing but staring into the new harsh
  world  infront of them ,ages and memories past by them maybe in the same place..rinkels
  that tell there hard and easy times and efforts they have put through to get to
  that moment.

  Or the respect between the young and the old generation. I saw the meaning of respectful
  heart and patience in working hard..just to get on the life weel.

  Or loving their traditions and being proud of the origins that made them a world
  power...just in humble way of showing the good in you...

  It truly made me feel like I''m just at the beginning of knowing the real life in
  small simple but deep things after i thought i already have a before view...small
  things that usually peoples or i would walk past by...those streets made me stop
  the time then...and take a closer look around me..

  Hong Kong was a striking realization for me and a big exemple of old and modern
  life combined with a middle of something unknown...such breath taking moments at
  the top of a tower....making me look from the top of the world as if I''m the powerful
  human being that i could be inside my mind...not an illusion but a hidden reality.

  Best thing is to have a chance to go discover different areas of this magnificent
  world.'
