Text: "After a long mornings walk, I and my traveling companions turned a corner to\
  \ find a great mound of soil rising up from the horizon. The mound wore a tumbledown\
  \ stone fortress for a hat and at its the base a little village appeared to be dug\
  \ out of the dirt. Called Castrojeriz, it was to be the next stop on our Spanish\
  \ pilgrimage. Nearer the town, some members of our party payed to go into one of\
  \ the cheesy relic-filled churches that appear along parts of the Camino de Santiago.\
  \ On this morning I declined to offer the ten euro fee to enter the church. As I\
  \ said goodbye to my friends, one of them waved her guidebook at me. \u2018See you\
  \ down the road!\u2019\n\nI wandered along the sandy cobbled streets waving hello\
  \ to the pilgrims who sometimes passed me. We would mutter the same words in greeting\
  \ and goodbye. \u2018Buen Camino.\u2019 \u2018Buen Camino.\u2019 A tall gray-haired\
  \ man was carefully sweeping dust from the doorstep of one of the wooden buildings\
  \ lining the roadway. On his head he wore a felted orange hat. As I slowly passed\
  \ in front of the next doorway, I stopped in my tracks to read the a small sign\
  \ on the window. I read the words and felt a warm hand come to rest on my shoulder.\
  \ Turning, I came face to face with the clear quiet eyes of the sweeping man. \u2018\
  Not everybody stops to look,\u2019 he said. \u2018Go in.\u2019 I looked up again\
  \ at the man\u2019s smile and his strange orange hat and turned the handle, revealing\
  \ a darkened interior. The sign on the door read \u2018The luxury of this place\
  \ is silence, please respect it.\u2019\n\nI entered \u2018el Hospital de Alma,\u2019\
  \ as the place was called and before I knew it, five hours had passed. The shadowy\
  \ house was filled with simple mystery nourished by silence. What were the sculptures\
  \ of rock and wood and bone hunched in every corner of the place? Is that pervasive\
  \ scent the smell of lavender? A big healthy pumpkin bloomed in the garden beneath\
  \ its leaf and vine. The pumpkin said nothing. I quietly watched a few pilgrims\
  \ walk by outside the window. Eventually, the man who had vanished, finally returned\
  \ without a word. \n\nIt was his house. It was his donation to el Camino and to\
  \ life. It was a place for pilgrims to rest but it was the kind of place the United\
  \ States doesn\u2019t have much of. It is not advertised and you have no idea what\
  \ is going on. It is there to be discovered as it is there to be ignored. \u2018\
  el Hospital del Alma\u2019 radiated its quiet peace, hiding in plain sight. And\
  \ the door is always there, unlocked & unperturbed."
