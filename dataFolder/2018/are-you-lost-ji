Text: "I was walking down the streets of Rishikesh, crunching sand under my bare feet\
  \ and head full of thoughts. I came to India a few months ago after a painful break-up\
  \ and as every Westerner here, I was trying to find my true self. Apart from that,\
  \ I wanted to discover my purpose in life and become enlightened. At least that\
  \ was the initial plan.\nRishikesh as the spiritual centre and capital of yoga seemed\
  \ as a perfect place for all these things. I just wanted to relax, do yoga and meditation\
  \ all the time and not think about anything else. Not about my past and not my future.\
  \ Just live in the moment and be aware of every breath I take.\nI had planned to\
  \ stay for a month and then come back to normal life again. My old boring work was\
  \ waiting for me as did my old tiny flat. So that was the other plan. \nI am here\
  \ more than six months already.\nI turned left and walked down the stairs to river\
  \ Ganges. I sat on the step near the river with my eyes closed. It was my daily\
  \ ritual. Just sit by the river and try to calm my mind.\n\u201CWhy are you so sad\
  \ today, Ji,\u201C asked a young Indian boy with a bowl full of flowers in his hands.\n\
  I knew him. I had already played this game with him so many times. He began to speak\
  \ about his studies. Then we talked about his brothers and newborn sister that I\
  \ had already known as well. In the end, I bought a bunch of flowers in the bowl\
  \ from him.\nI ignited the tiny piece of paper in the bowl and walked down closer\
  \ to the holy river Ganges. The Ganges is personified as goddess Ganga and is considered\
  \ sacred. As the Ganges is the most sacred river in Hindu mythology, it is believed\
  \ that ritual bathing in the river can wash away all sins. If only it was so easy!\n\
  I bent my knees and sent my burning flower bowl to the flow of the river Ganges\
  \ together with my wishes. Then I stood up again and slowly went up the stairs.\
  \ Suddenly, I had a feeling that I should not go any further. I learn that I should\
  \ listen to my inner voice more so I stopped and gazed back.\nAnd then I saw her\
  \ there. I looked down deep into her eyes and smiled. She smiled back. Another Indian\
  \ boy came with his bowl of flowers. \n\u201CYou look lost, Ji. Are you alright?\u201D\
  \ He looked at me worried. \nI knew it was just a game to sell the flowers but at\
  \ that moment I was grateful for it. Everything began to make sense.\nI looked up\
  \ from my reflection in the river and smiled back at him.\n\u201CI\u2019m not lost,\u201D\
  \ I said as nicely as I could as I was not going to buy any flowers from him. \n\
  \u201CI\u2019m home.\u201D"
