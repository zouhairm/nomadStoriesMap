Text: "Twenty-two and there I stood at Praha Hlavni Nadrazi railway station, searching\
  \ the split-flap display for my platform to Beroun, but the words spelled out nothing\
  \ recognizable, and the locals barely spoke English, which left me lost in my plan.\
  \  Yet, footloose and fancy free, I was optimistic that a guide of some sort would\
  \ show me the way!\n\nThen, along came Eva who spoke English!  She asked the ticket\
  \ agent and led me to my train. And so, there we were -- me at the steps of the\
  \ train and Eva looking worried, for I had no reserved shelter for the night.  Little\
  \ did I know my plan was about to change tracks...\n\nEva said, \"Come with me...Make\
  \ up your mind quick!\" \n(This was too sudden, but alluring. I was thrilled, but\
  \ uncertain.)\nI said, \"No, I'll be okay... Okay-- I'll go with you!\"\n\nI stepped\
  \ off the train; the door closed.  We ran back to the ticket booth, then back to\
  \ the platforms to catch our train -- at the far end!  We boarded; the door closed.\
  \ 360 seconds of a mad rush!\n\nWe sat down on hard seats with a laugh, and as we\
  \ chatted, I had no concern redirecting to a town called Mrac.  I already trusted\
  \ this Czech lady in a brown leather jacket with hair as short as mine.  She was\
  \ spirited to invite a stranger; I was intrepid for an adventure. She was curious\
  \ about my nomadic travel; I was curious about her culture. Three years ago, her\
  \ country had a \"velvet divorce\" from Slovakia; three years ago, I separated from\
  \ my academia to live a peripatetic lifestyle.  Eva and I were so similar although\
  \ we were more than a decade apart.  I felt overhelmingly blessed to have made this\
  \ serendipitous connection on my first day.\n\nThe following nights, I stayed at\
  \ Eva's home in Fulnek and met her husband, Lubosh, and her daughter, \"Little Eve\"\
  \ -- a sweet, pretty girl of ten with a youthful blush.  They were both pleasant,\
  \ but quiet.  One evening, over dinner of salted lettuce, boiled potatoes, and fried\
  \ flounders, Eva asked 'Little Eve\" to join us for an excursion the next day, but\
  \ she rather not, obliging her father to stay home as well.  Eva was disappointed\
  \ as a mother, for she wanted her daughter to be gregarious.  I felt her sadness\
  \ because I was an adherent; Eva and I both see the wisdom of opening ourselves\
  \ to the world in order to understand our world.\n\nBack home in America, I recounted\
  \ my travel experience as I packaged a box of American items to send.  I felt exuberant\
  \ and complete, knowing soon, I would be connecting them with a part of my world."
