Text: "Although the windows were locked shut, the chanting from the anti-independence\
  \ crowd leaked through the thin walls of the bus. I opened my eyes and glanced back\
  \ at the angry Spaniards as we pulled away from the Pla\xE7a d'Espanya curb. The\
  \ vibrant reds and yellows of the flag eventually blurred together until they were\
  \ no longer in sight, but their voices played over and over in my head like a scratchy\
  \ record on repeat.\n\nBarcelona, the city branded by publicists as the playground\
  \ of Gaud\xED, a colorful mosaic of tiles on a lizard's back, was a source of intrigue\
  \ for an American. Yet, as the bus pulled into the rain beating the side of Montjuic,\
  \ my vision grew foggy with exhaustion. While the voices from the crowd became a\
  \ whisper, I dreamed of Catalan cuisine and gingerbread towers.\n\n\"Propera Parada:\
  \ Sitges,\" I heard faintly. One eye cracked open, and I shifted my gaze to the\
  \ window. Past the smudges on the glass, the sea stretched out before me like diamonds\
  \ glittering on the vast, blue terrain. I vaguely heard a man rumble in Catalan\
  \ to the driver, and the bus halted with a slight groan. Hastily grabbing my backpack,\
  \ I almost tripped on the way out the door and eventually stumbled to the side of\
  \ the road. The bus was long gone before I realized where I was.\n\nThe advertised\
  \ white buildings of downtown Sitges twinkled atop a hill that was possibly two\
  \ miles, no, three kilometers, away. To my right, a car whizzed past me on the street,\
  \ clearly traveling too fast for me to consider walking down that road. To my left,\
  \ a hilly, grassy region appeared to extend for forever, eventually reaching the\
  \ Spanish horizon. I pulled out my phone, hoping to use my GPS, only to find that\
  \ I had no service. The only option seemed to be trekking up the hills.\n\nI had\
  \ hardly traveled a hundred meters before I slipped and toppled headfirst into the\
  \ mud. The dirt pushed its way into my mouth and covered my eyes like tribal paint.\
  \ It struck me momentarily that I had never experienced this type of solitude before.\
  \ I was in the middle of a Catalonian field, painted with mud, with no cell service\
  \ and no visions of Gaud\xED gingerbread houses as promised in the guidebooks. It\
  \ seemed that traveling would produce a slightly different, yet eccentric, outcome\
  \ than planned."
