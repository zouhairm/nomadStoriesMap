Text: "He was one of many vendors of hookahs, glass baubles and costumes near the\
  \ Blue Mosque.  There was nothing necessarily unique or different about his little\
  \ stall, packed with all the colors and textures that one would expect from a \"\
  tourist trap\" vendor. \n\nMy colleague David and I were living in Istanbul, both\
  \ on a consulting assignment for a bank. On weekends, we would explore different\
  \ neighborhoods. During Ramadan, there were lots of special stalls, and lights were\
  \ strung across pathways around the mosques, adding to the ambiance of an already\
  \ stunning city.\n\nOur knowledge of Ramadan was limited to depravation: no food\
  \ nor water from sunrise to sunset. This year it fell in September and the days\
  \ were still quite long. Emre, our unlikely vendor friend, would shortly enlighten\
  \ us.\n\nEmre smiled as he caught David's eye that one day we were wandering by.\
  \ \"Something special for your wife!\" he called. David was married, but not to\
  \ me. We laughed: \"No thank you, we're not married.\" Unfazed, Emre knew he had\
  \ achieved the first step in tourism sales: engage and make eye contact.\n\nIt was\
  \ hot, but inside the kiosk was cool thanks to an oscillating fan. Glass lanterns\
  \ hung from the ceiling, hookahs of all sizes lined the wall, and traditional outfits\
  \ in the brightest blues, pinks, and yellows swayed in the breeze. \n\nStudents\
  \ of diplomacy via business, we respectfully said \"Ramadan Mubarak.\" With no other\
  \ customers, Emre invited us for tea. We were embarrassed to drink tea while he\
  \ was still hours from refreshment, but we also couldn't say no. We asked him did\
  \ he mind the long, hot days of fasting. He said he used to when he was young, but\
  \ now what kept him going was the evening feast.\n\n\"You must join us tonight!\"\
  \ David and I looked at each other. Who were we but random tourists who neither\
  \ knew this man nor actually bought anything from him? \"Please, bring nothing but\
  \ yourselves.\" We agreed. That tiny kiosk was later packed with family, friends\
  \ and food. We bought some flowers, and our arrival induced exclamations of welcome\
  \ and joy. Only Emre spoke English, but we were all able to communicate through\
  \ the sharing of this delicious meal. \n\nTo this day, when I learn that someone\
  \ is going to Istanbul, I could offer all of the typical suggestions: the spice\
  \ market, the ferry up the Bosphorus, the food - good lord the food! But what I\
  \ always suggest is to go to the third stall on the right as you are facing the\
  \ Blue Mosque and tell Emre that David and Anne sent you."
