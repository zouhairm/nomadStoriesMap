Text: "Travelling to Hengam Island, in the Persian Gulf, and meeting a philosopher\
  \ sounded very unlikely to me. However, it is what we\u2019ve done, with my group\
  \ of friend in the fall of 2013.\n\nWe\u2019ve flown over the sumptuous Shiraz\u2019\
  \ gardens, the snow covered hills of T\xE9h\xE9ran and the millenia carpet\u2019\
  s museums, the Persepolis\u2019 Zoroastrian ruins, the magnificent mosques of Isfahan,\
  \ and the yellow windswept city in the desert, Yazd. We\u2019ve had eaten many fine\
  \ mezze - little various dishes - with saffron rice in fancy restaurants or lavash\
  \ - traditional flat pancakes - in tiny street sellers. \n\nBut none of those incredible\
  \ landscape, architecture or food could excelled the discovery of iranian people.\
  \ Women and men we\u2019ve met along the road were those kind of people for whom\
  \ the fear and the individualism haven\u2019t yet undermine the curiosity and the\
  \ willingness to meet others and their differences.\n\nWe were at the Bander Abbas\
  \ harbour to go to the Hengam Island, on the Persian Gulf\u2019 coasts, when we\
  \ met Damoon. As it happened several times in the last days, he simply came to talk\
  \ with us. He was in his late forty, wearing like an explorer with that soft hat\
  \ and his sleeveless, full of pockets jacket, and he was holding a huge camera worned\
  \ around his neck. He presented himself as a \u201CTourist in his own country, poet\
  \ and philosopher\u201D.\n\nAfter arriving in the Hengam Island with a yellow and\
  \ blue wooden boat, passing over corals, dolphins, and turtles in the transparent\
  \ water, we visited several calcareous beaches with lunar landscapes and met women\
  \ in colored draped fabric selling shells jewelry. In one of those beach, after\
  \ spending an hour in meditation, Damoon prepared some lavash with cheese and nuts,\
  \ that he gave to each of us. \n\n- What does Damoon means ? \n- Damoon means the\
  \ play of light and shadow in the leaves of the tree.\nWhat is your philosophy of\
  \ life ? he asked.\n- \u2026.. hmmm don\u2019t really know\u2026 Maybe travel a\
  \ lot and enjoy ? What about yours ?\n- Mine is to always think that life is a pool\
  \ of joy and what makes this pool incredible is that you don\u2019t know what\u2019\
  s gonna be inside and especially who you gonna meet. What\u2019s make it beautiful\
  \ is that you don\u2019t know what tomorrow is.\n\nSince this day, I keep Damoon\u2019\
  s word in mind, as a little treasure in my heart that I can grab anytime I am afraid\
  \ of meeting others, or when I don\u2019t know the shape of following days. Knowing\
  \ that this is precisely what is beautiful, in travel and in life."
