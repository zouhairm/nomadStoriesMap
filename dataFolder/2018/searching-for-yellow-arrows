Text: "I went in search of yellow arrows along the northern countryside of Spain,\
  \ but what I found was so much more. The yellow arrows in question are the signs\
  \ that point the direction when walking the Camino Santiago de Compostela. The Camino\
  \ is a five-hundred-mile sacred pilgrimage route that begins in the French foothills\
  \ of the Pyrenees Mountains in an ancient village called St. Jean Pied de Port.\
  \ After hiking over the famous mountains, you make your way through the Basque country\
  \ walking west across northern Spain until you reach Santiago where the remains\
  \ of St. James are said to be buried. \n\nOn a dark, crisp, Sunday morning in early\
  \ August at half past six I began my pilgrimage. The air quality suggested that\
  \ rain was in the forecast, and this would be an unwelcome addition to a day of\
  \ hiking especially when a 16-mile journey up the Pyrenees mountains at an altitude\
  \ of approximately 4,600 feet was on the agenda.  As if on que, the further up the\
  \ mountain I hiked, the rain that been promised at the bottom began to fall as I\
  \ sloshed my way through animal dung belonging to free-range goats, horses, and\
  \ cows that, in herds, were peppered along the verdant mountainside. \n\nOnce on\
  \ top of the mountain the rain briefly came to a lull and I stood drenched, defeated,\
  \ and exhausted, but as I looked out over the stunning vistas of rolling green hills\
  \ my eyes filled with tears. Even though there was fear about what the next month\
  \ of hiking would hold for me, I knew I was doing the right thing.\n\nI would notoriously\
  \ become anxious thinking I had missed the most recent yellow arrow rendering myself\
  \ lost, but just before I would have a complete meltdown the arrow would appear.\
  \ They always materialized at just the right time and this was my saving grace.\n\
  \nI was recently at a party with a friend, and he mentioned to a group of people\
  \ that I had walked the Camino. There were inquiries as to why I would do such a\
  \ thing. In an effort to keep the conversation light I answered.\n\n\u201CI wanted\
  \ spend thirty days chasing five hundred miles worth of yellow arrows!\u201D \n\n\
  \u201CBut why?\u201D One party goer insisted. \n\nI sighed knowing how this would\
  \ turn out but spoke boldly.\n\n\u201CBecause I needed to learn about faith and\
  \ courage.\u201D\n\nAmid the awkward stares someone offered to get drinks and the\
  \ circle broke up. However, I had been transported back to the rocky paths and the\
  \ mountains climbed while I pursued yellow arrows across northern Spain. I smiled\
  \ to myself and knew that I would never be the same."
