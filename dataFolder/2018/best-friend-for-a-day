Text: "Last year when I visited Argentina I expected to meet some people to hang out\
  \ with. But I did not expect such a warm welcome. It all began at the hostel. The\
  \ receptionist behaved as my brother to me. He gave me a lot of tips to move in\
  \ the city, warned me about dangerous places and advised me on how to act so that\
  \ nobody knew I was a tourist. In the evening everybody at the hostel invited me\
  \ to join them. We went to buy food and we cooked all together.\n\nIt was like having\
  \ a family. By chance, they all were Argentinian living in Buenos Aires and they\
  \ all were looking for a place to live in. This was perfect for me. I was enjoying\
  \ Buenos Aires surrounded by local people. I did not expect to have such a good\
  \ connexion there, as I was in the capital and big cities are usually not the best\
  \ place to find warm and open people.\n\nBut actually, my favourite encounter in\
  \ Argentina was in Puerto Iguaz\xFA. I was there at the bus station waiting for\
  \ the bus to get to the Brazilian side of the falls. Suddenly, an Argentinian man\
  \ asked me to help him to turn off the Internet in his mobile phone, as we were\
  \ going to cross the border. He was about 70 years old.\n\nWe spent the whole day\
  \ together talking about the stunning views, my experience in Argentina and about\
  \ our home towns. I remember I was exhausted, since I had spent the whole night\
  \ in a bus from Buenos Aires to Puerto Iguaz\xFA, but his company really cheered\
  \ me up. His mentality and his ideas about life made me forget my tiredness. It\
  \ was so interesting exchanging thoughts with somebody totally different from me.\n\
  \nAlso the landscape helped us to open ourselves. We were so impressed by the noise\
  \ of the water that we could not help being ourselves at that moment. The child\
  \ in us came out and we were suddenly enjoying pure nature. I had seen the ocean\
  \ before, but I had the feeling that I had never seen so much water before.\n\n\
  The water would splash on us so hard that at the end of the day we could have been\
  \ totally soaked. Luckily we found two raincoats that somebody else had left behind\
  \ and we wore them.\n\nAt the end of our visit to Iguaz\xFA Falls, the man told\
  \ me that that one was his seventh time there. I could not believe it. He did not\
  \ want to tell me this before because he wanted the place to fully impress me without\
  \ knowing his opinion about it. Instead of showing off and telling me everything,\
  \ he wanted me to have my own experience.\n\nThis was touching and I really had\
  \ one of the most memorable experiences of my life."
