Text: "Valentine's Day\n    After a rough end of the year and holiday season the husband\
  \ and I decide it was time for a split..last December the papers were in...filed\
  \ with the lawyer..everyone was consumed with greif. I couldn't let go so I tried\
  \ my hardest and won him back..\n January was very similar the fights drinking and\
  \ distrust..we agreed to get along and in true married fashion.. we\n( rock..paper..scissored)\
  \ to see who would plan the dreaded..dun dun duh obligatory Vday extravaganza.\n\
  I won..for once it was his turn to treat me..so if course he let me pick the place.\
  \ \"Chicago\" we go 6x a year..it's one of my favorite places. We \"I \" book the\
  \ Air b&b..get the stuff packed..get the money in order..we go..\nMy husband drank\
  \ the whole ride..we have been having issues with it lately a ton..I hate it because\
  \ I love it..place is wondwrful..huge with a Jacuzzi tub..we brought our oldest\
  \ because she's 17 and just likes to hang out..then it begun\n Grub Hub isn't working..he's\
  \ at a 2 on the rictore scale..\nThe place closes soon but it still won't work..4..we\
  \ need more booze and everyone is hungry...6..hours have gone by at this point and\
  \ we both worked all day..let me set the mood..highly wintery..unusual for Chicago..death\
  \ and freezing ice everywhere..Chicagoans have abandoned there vehicles with feet\
  \ piled on roofs.\nMy husband is 14,000 sheets to the wind \"drunk as f\" \nLets\
  \ just get the food..so of course I go.\n Chicago is beautiful in winter..not in\
  \ a white out! Real fear was there with this guy behind the wheel..screaming at\
  \ cars..yelling because we are from #puremichigan \n We make it to the restaurant..8..our\
  \ food is ordered to-go...\nNarrator: \"It did not go well for the staff\"\n  We\
  \ arrive back to the amazingly huge and beautiful once in a lifetime stays..he screams\
  \ at me the whole way back..incoherent after taking us an hour out of the way in\
  \ that storm..I was crushed..\n I left Chicago resentful and uncaring..in a hurry\
  \ to go back to the work week with no emotions..simple mundain boring life filled\
  \ with alcohol and not fun trips to Chicago..I thought..I pondered what's better\
  \ than this? \n So..one month later I've found truth..started alcohol treatment\
  \ and for sober..thoughts of Chicago's beautiful skyline at night..rich industry\
  \ and up and coming tech..remembering the sites and smells..soul food in Hyde park..that\
  \ \"egg place\" downtown like my kids say..shopping and rich history..\nChicago\
  \ is my home regardless..remembering that is how I got my life back"
