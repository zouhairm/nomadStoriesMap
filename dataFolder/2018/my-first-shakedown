Text: "In over 24 years of travel, I'd never been shaken down by bad cops. Yet here\
  \ I was, on the B1 highway heading into Windhoek, driving an aging Toyota Hilux\
  \ with my family, trying to suddenly figure out how much cash I had in my pocket.\n\
  \nNobody had warned me about this in Namibia. There were rumours in central Cambodia\
  \ about cops pulling over foreigners on motorbikes to issue random \u201Ctickets\u201D\
  . There was the ominous warning from a friend about the police stationed near the\
  \ Zimbabwe border known for taking whatever the border agents had left you with.\
  \ Heck, my adrenaline spiked every time I passed a police car hidden amongst the\
  \ wildflowers while I sped down the highways of southern Spain.\n\nBut Namibia wasn\u2019\
  t on my radar.\n\nMy family and I had rented a 4x4 for a 5000km adventure. We were\
  \ Road Warriors, seeking out the red, Namib sand dunes, the golden sunsets of Sossusvlei\
  \ and the clear, cold rock pools of the Naukluft Mountains. And, suddenly, we found\
  \ ourselves waved aside at a police checkpoint on our way into Windhoek.\n\nStrange.\
  \ We were usually waved through.\n\nI rolled down my window, and the tall, pot-bellied\
  \ officer sidled over and demanded my license. I handed him my Canadian ID and he\
  \ didn't even look at it. Only at me. He never broke eye contact.\n\nNamibia had\
  \ seemed so safe, so familiar, so friendly. Strangers had offered advice on the\
  \ best tire pressure to avoid getting stuck in the sand dunes (note: 15 PSI). But,\
  \ here was this cop, looming over me, giving me the stare down, and I wasn\u2019\
  t prepared.\n\n\"Do you have a spoon?\"\n\nPause.\n\nWhat did he ask?\n\n\u201C\
  Uhhh...pardon?\u201D\n\n\"Do you have a spoon?\"\n\nAnother long pause.\n\nWas it\
  \ a euphemism? Was it a joke? What the $#% do I do?\n\n\"Do you have a PLASTIC spoon?\"\
  \n\nEmphasis was his. He was getting frustrated.\n\n\"Uh...maybe, sir.\"\n\nThankfully\
  \ we did. Plus some leftover carrot sticks.\n\nMy wife slowly reached into her daypack\
  \ and, in the Ziploc bag full of wet naps, condiments, and the aforementioned carrot\
  \ sticks, she sourced a plastic spoon.\n\nI handed it to the officer.\n\nHe took\
  \ it.\n\nHis tone changed immediately. \"Thanks, brother! My partner needs to take\
  \ her medicine.\"\n\nHe handed me my license and waved me through.\n\nI put the\
  \ truck into drive, and, as I pulled forward, I noticed his partner, sitting in\
  \ the shade, holding a bottle of cough syrup, waving at me and mouthing the words\
  \ \"thank you.\"\n\nIt was my first shakedown and the last thing I expected was\
  \ that the cop would take plastic instead of cash."
