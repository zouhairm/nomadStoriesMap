Text: "Lessons can be learned the easy way, but you\u2019re rarely ever truly taught\
  \ something without enduring a little difficulty. I began my ascent on the scenic,\
  \ forest route up Penang Hill, dismissing the land train despite having received\
  \ looks of disbelief from the hostel staff. \nAdmittedly, I underestimated the physical\
  \ haul ahead. The sheer gradient and Malaysian heat had me gasping for breath every\
  \ few minutes, calves burning. But with dusky leaf monkeys, endless vibrant petals\
  \ and the occasional carnivorous plant, I couldn\u2019t complain. Arrows faintly\
  \ painted on rocks were my only guidance. An old Malaysian man with a toothless\
  \ smile gave me a mango and tried to reassure my rosy cheeks that I was \u201CAlmost\
  \ there!\u201D\nAn hour later, he and his motorbike came chugging by, loaded with\
  \ tediously balanced fruit baskets, \u201CYou can do it!\u201D His belief fired\
  \ my engine to stomp up the last stretch of the (modestly named) hill. I was greeted\
  \ with a panorama of endless luscious greenery, the ocean sparkling in the distance.\
  \ Worth it.\nIndulging in the satisfaction of my accomplishment and mesmerised by\
  \ the view, I hardly noticed the crowds of people. \u201CAh, you make it! Welcome\
  \ my friend!\u201D A gummy grin beamed at me from a smoothie stall. Jumping up and\
  \ embracing my hand, Zikri introduced himself. Unfortunately, my intentions to get\
  \ the train back down were disappointing. \u201COo, my friend! 45 minute it take\
  \ you! Faster down!\u201D I apologetically thanked him and headed for the train.\
  \ However, upon realising the wait for a ticket was 2 hours, Zikri\u2019s words\
  \ haunted me.\n45 minutes, 45 minutes, 45 minutes\u2026\nClouds fell into the treetops,\
  \ fog twisted its way through vegetation. Why hadn\u2019t I checked the time? The\
  \ jungle was awakening as the darkness of night set in. My only light was the torch\
  \ on my phone. He\u2019d overestimated me. Scenarios of vicious monkeys, speeding\
  \ jeeps and kidnappings replayed through my mind. I picked up my pace. After an\
  \ hour, I was only half way down. \u2018Low Battery. 20% remaining.\u2019 Wonderful.\
  \ 3 cars passed me. 3 cars ignored my flashing light and waving arms. Blinking back\
  \ tears, all I could do was keep going. Another engine approached, \u201CMy friend!\
  \ Get on, get on!\u201D Crying with joy at the sight of Zikri\u2019s distinct smile\
  \ as I clambered on the bike, waves of relief liberated me. Speeding through the\
  \ dark, we were at the bottom in no time. I showered Zikri in notes despite him\
  \ repeatedly refusing, I couldn\u2019t even begin to repay this kind soul.\nNext\
  \ time I\u2019ll catch the train."
