Text: "I started a new job in Bridgwater in the South West of England. On arrival\
  \ I met up with a local, a friend of a friend, who warned me of Bridgwater's lack\
  \ of 'colour.'  \nI laughed these claims off,  I couldn't take them seriously. \
  \ I am who challenges myself to find beauty and novelty wherever i am.\nHowever,\
  \ in the light of day - I was worried his assessment may have been right. The shops\
  \ in the own were dated and poorly maintained - on the side of river was an unfortunate\
  \ business that went by the name of 'Colin Fear Insurance'. I was demoralised and\
  \ the rest of week coaked up in my rented room, unsure of how to spend my time.\
  \ \nDeciding I was determined to find 'color'. I planned a trip to Crowcombe, a\
  \ village my father said he'd visited as a child, armed only with a few snacks my\
  \ film camera. \nI asked around discovering I'd need to take a short train to Taunton,\
  \ a nearby town, followed by an hour long bus into the Quantock Hills. \nThe landscape\
  \ I was entering was quite different from the small industrial town of my work.\
  \ I was surrounded by rolling vibrant green hills and the bristol channel opened\
  \ up in front of the flat road before me. \nThe stop for Crowcombe didn't look like\
  \ much, it was tiny and overgrown.  I made my way down the thin slope into the village\
  \ and was soon surrounded by quaint thatch houses. I spotted an interesting turning\
  \ on the left side of the road and followed the path up  a hill for about 20 minutes\
  \ soon finding myself in a  wood. \nIt had a tranquil atmosphere. There was a beautiful\
  \ shell of an old house being reclaimed my nature. It was covered in nettles and\
  \ netting from the collapsed ceiling.\nI soon found myself on a main road that led\
  \ back into the village. I sauntered into the local pub, enticed by a cabinet of\
  \ second hand books in the window sill. I sat at the back at first quietly sipping\
  \ a coke. There were two elderly men at the bar chatting, I felt a compulsion to\
  \ ask what else there was to do. They recommended that I walk up to Quantock Common\
  \ - a moor spanning the hilltops. \nIt was beautiful, framed by ancient twisted\
  \ trees. The grass in the middle which overlooked the ocean contained every colour\
  \ of heather imaginable.\nI spotted a cluster of wild horses further down the heath.\
  \ They were friendly when I approached and petted them. It was a magical experience.\
  \ \nThe hills provided the 'colour' I was in need of and became my favourite haunt."
