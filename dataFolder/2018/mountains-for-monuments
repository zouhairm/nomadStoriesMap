Text: "Huge granite walls loomed upwards ahead of us, their gnarled dark grey faces\
  \ glittered in the wet sunlight. Silver-white waterfalls, snaking downwards like\
  \ skeletal arms, fell distantly in slow motion from six hundred feet above.\n\n\
  \  This was Fiordland, New Zealand, a region carved out by the god-like force of\
  \ glaciers. My brother and I had been hiking in the area for a few weeks and had\
  \ now set our sights on 'Gertrude Saddle' - a treacherous day hike dubbed as one\
  \ of the finest in the world. Taking expert advice from a Department of Conservation\
  \ ranger, we would need a day of dry weather to safely attempt the climb to the\
  \ saddle. Now, in a place where roughly eight metres of rain falls every year, such\
  \ a day is hard to come by and must be seized. Fortunately for us, a window in the\
  \ weather was fast approaching. So with our preparations made, backpacks stripped\
  \ to the essentials and maps studied, seize it we did. \n\nEyes wide and muscles\
  \ pumping we clambered on up into the valley, into that fortress of granite, through\
  \ alpine meadows and past rushing streams. Upwards we rose, aided by steel cables\
  \ drilled into the very face of the cold smooth granite. Our hot hands burning on\
  \ the icy ropes. Following the rock cairns, we picked our way slowly onwards through\
  \ the slick boulders. We had arrived.\nAs I crested the saddle I caught a glimpse,\
  \ a mere flash of giant spits of land looming out of the valley. Then nothing, nothing\
  \ but swirling mists rising like clouds of thick steam, as if bellowed upwards out\
  \ of the abyss from the vents of some ominous machine. We hunkered down amongst\
  \ the tussocks and waited. Other hikers came and went, staying a while but seeing\
  \ little. Had my eyes been deceived? Still we waited. Then, as sunset fell & as\
  \ quickly as they had disappeared hours before, grizzled ridgelines reared into\
  \ view like the enormous prows of ships cutting through fog. Rivers stretched away\
  \ into the horizon, slicing their path far below into the forests of green like\
  \ pale veins. Our patience had truly paid off.\n\n As the alpine vistas laid siege\
  \ to my eyes, It hit me that with no ancient monuments to wonder upon, no towns\
  \ steeped in stories stretching back thousands of years, the majority of history\
  \ and culture in New Zealand lay in the land. The connection the locals felt was\
  \ with the environment all around them. There on Gertrude Saddle we were but tiny\
  \ specks amongst a ferocious wilderness. Yet, connected to that rolling expanse,\
  \ our spirits were formidable."
