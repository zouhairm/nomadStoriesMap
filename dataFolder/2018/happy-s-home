Text: "When I was twelve years old, I visited Hong Kong for the first time with my\
  \ folks. One day, we took a double decker bus from Kowloon bus station to visit\
  \ an amusement park named Song Dynasty Village in Lai Chi Kok by the ocean.  Although\
  \ this park has now been demolished to build condos, it holds a sparkle in my memories.\n\
  \nWe walked through the main gate during the Spring Festival, when ochre Chinese\
  \ lanterns and scarlet tassels hung from every porch.  Their dark roofs curved gracefully\
  \ from the mountains to the ocean.  The entire scene was exotic to me, and many\
  \ visitors milled about, eating, laughing, watching. \n\nAs we approached the village\
  \ square, a man in a sky blue kungfu shirt was holding himself aloft with one bulging\
  \ arm on a pile of bricks on a table, while his wiry and tanned companions watched.\
  \ I stared, wide-eyed, as he did a front flip and landed on Chinese butcher knives\
  \ with their blade side pointing up. It was exciting yet I also cringed.\n\nAfter\
  \ the performance, I went to ask him if his feet hurt.  His name was Hoi Sum, which\
  \ means Happy, and he told me his feet were okay but I thought I saw blue marks\
  \ on the soles.  He said he had been an acrobat at Song Dynasty Village for six\
  \ months and lived in the New Territories. I exclaimed, \u201CYou are so amazing!\u201D\
  . He grinned and suggested that we meet for dim sum on the weekend near his home\
  \ in Yuen Lang.\n\nOn New Year\u2019s Eve, my family rode a double decker bus from\
  \ Kowloon station to Yuen Lang. It was a jovial ride as we drank soybean milk, ate\
  \ rooster tail buns filled with coconut, and enjoyed the mountain views. Once we\
  \ got off the bus in Yuen Lang, however, I smelled dust, humans, and sewage, as\
  \ we crossed a river encased in concrete. The banquet-style restaurant was filled\
  \ with diners, and Hoi Sum waved animatedly at us.  I could tell that we were from\
  \ different worlds and yet we shared local family histories and a love for foods\
  \ such as Phoenix Claws in XO sauce.\n\nAfter lunch, Hoi Sum took us to his home\
  \ nearby, in a walled village. Behind the ancient wall, there was a new housing\
  \ development site. He unlocked a metal front door to show us one room home where\
  \ he, his wife and two daughters lived.  I was surprised to see a shower curtain\
  \ and drain inside the living room.   Also, when he took us to the courtyard of\
  \ his complex, many children were running and laughing amidst a jumble of potted\
  \ plants.  Even though our homes looked outwardly different, some things about them\
  \ were exactly the same."
