Text: "My fever went up, as the sun came down; and arriving from the east, the biggest\
  \ hurricane the Caribbean had seen in human history. Irma was its name, and she\
  \ made me feel minuscule and lonely. \u201CYou shouldn\u2019t tease nature if you\u2019\
  re congested\u201D said earlier Germinalia, my ninety years old host, as her son\
  \ took me to the seafront so we could feel the strong winds. As Pedro opened the\
  \ front door, a light scarf landed over my head whilst Germinalia shouted in perfect\
  \ synchrony. The scarf was shot away and met cans, papers and clothes that kept\
  \ crossing windows and doors to drift away in the most beautiful dance of chaos.\
  \ My throat began to close, partly because of the lack of cover against the oddly\
  \ cold wind, but truly because of the feeling of vulnerability before the most powerful\
  \ force of nature I had ever dared to look in the eyes. The quirky dance soon invited\
  \ more substantial objects as we tried to walk further. It was impossible to take\
  \ another step now. Glass flew from the hospital windows and smashed the floor.\
  \ Tiles were teared from the roofs of the houses like slices of cheese and quickly\
  \ ventured into the street eager to test their sharpness. Humans hid. The sun hid.\
  \ Irma had arrived to Cuba.\n\nNobody slept until Irma had drifted away from the\
  \ island in the early hours. Germinalia took care of my fever hallucinations until\
  \ the wooden doors and windows stopped their attempts in breaking free from all\
  \ the nails that held them together. I wasn\u2019t sure where I was that night,\
  \ my guts were convinced that I had travelled to the old Havana; and my demons were\
  \ exorcised by this priestess dressed in flowers. But that morning, there were no\
  \ flowers. Nor leaves on the trees. From the terrace of the house we saw a redeemed\
  \ Havana; a little destroyed, yes, but also purified. The sea had eaten some blocks\
  \ of city and was quietly strolling in front of the house. The city was silent,\
  \ it felt like harder times were coming. Unworried by the picture, Germinalia had\
  \ other things in her mind. \u201CIs your mother bulky?\u201D she asked. \u201C\
  Last night, after you got to close your eyes, I saw a bulky and curly woman standing\
  \ in front of your room\u201D. I didn\u2019t understand if she had dreamt it or\
  \ actually saw her, but my mother is tiny anyway. \u201CShe wanted me to tell you\
  \ that she feels happy for you. She also wanted me to give you this\u201D, She surrounded\
  \ my body with her motherly arms, and cured my loneliness with the warmest hug I\
  \ have felt since my bulky and curly grandmother passed away."
