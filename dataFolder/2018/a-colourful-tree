Text: "A sudden water drop on the mud trodden ground that turned into an abundance\
  \ of drops that swept across the open field. We had just arrived and managed to\
  \ pick up an old battered black audio guide. It was also supplied with black over\
  \ the head headphones, with rips in the netting that protected your ears.\n\nI had\
  \ heard about the killing fields, and knew I wanted to visit whilst in Cambodia.\
  \ I picked up a black umbrella, and tried to dodge the puddles like a child playing\
  \ the lava game. The paths turning into rivers and the mud clogging my trainers.\
  \ \nI reached a monument, a monument with a variety of artists. A monument stooped,\
  \ entwined and connected with the history and memories of this open space. A piece\
  \ of art that no one chose to be a part of. It stood tall, much taller in fact then\
  \ it actually was. The rain drops hitting the glass and spraying off in a variety\
  \ of directions, attempting to blur what was hidden inside. The skulls were still\
  \ prominent however, stacked and packed in the glass caging like books in a bookcase.\
  \ Each one containing a different story, but all following the basic narrative of\
  \ a beginning middle and end. \n\nThe voice of my guide now resonated in my ears,\
  \ as the words of despair and pain rang through. I had given up trying to fight\
  \ with mud, which was now being washed away. I slipped and struggled up the paths\
  \ against the flow of the newly formed mud rivers, the mud splattering on my trainers\
  \ and the backs of my legs. You could see the spring of new life as sprouts of green\
  \ appeared, showing promise and hope. I continued my walk coming to an abrupt stopped\
  \ when instructed to do so by my guide, who I now felt was like my only friend.\
  \ There were quite a few people around but I only noticed and acknowledged this\
  \ soothing voice. \n\nWe had stopped in front of a tree. A tall tree, which had\
  \ begun to drop. Signs of new life on its branches as fresh leaves began to grow\
  \ with the water running along them. You could see the lines and cracks within the\
  \ sturdy trunk. Then colour. Lots of colour. A few coloured strings tethered and\
  \ battered with love, loosely tied to the branches hanging on. I heard my friend\
  \ speak, \u201Chere lies the tree in which young children would be thrashed upon,\
  \ and quite often killed.\u201D  \n\nIt was just a tree. But a tree that dropped\
  \ in pain and swayed to the cries of the young ones filled with colour. I just stood\
  \ in silence, in an open field. A silence I didn\u2019t expect but a silence so\
  \ loud it still rings in my ears."
