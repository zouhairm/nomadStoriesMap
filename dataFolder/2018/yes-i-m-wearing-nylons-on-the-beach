Text: "The first thing Cartagena taught me: nothing in my wardrobe is fit for summer.\
  \ Each day the sweat seeped from my denim shorts and the flesh-coloured nylon tights\
  \ I insisted on wearing over my pink and white pimpled legs, their cheap gloss illuminated\
  \ under the intensity of the sun. I can hardly believe I\u2019m confessing to the\
  \ tights, wearing them in a Caribbean climate was simply a crime and everybody who\
  \ looked my way knew it. But the whole experience of blazing sunshine in January\
  \ had really just knocked me for six.\n\nThis whole trip had just knocked me for\
  \ six, as these things will when, in a fit of insomnia, you order a credit card\
  \ and max it out on a single sandwich and a flight halfway round the world. But\
  \ Cartagena had come to feel like my last chance. I had become old. My back ached.\
  \ I had been at my office job for longer than I had ever been at school, and all\
  \ I had learned in that time was how to trick the printer settings when it started\
  \ trying to claim it was out of paper.\n\nHere, each morning in my local caf\xE9\
  , I would pose for hours with a notebook hoping to capture my surroundings and the\
  \ fragments of Spanish that burbled around me. This, I decided, was surely my calling,\
  \ my real life, and not the sham that had been slowly unfolding behind the stiff\
  \ white blinds of the office. I tried to forget that my Spanish had already plateaued\
  \ three years ago when I accidentally told my language exchange I was feeling filthy\
  \ and after he\u2019d finally stopped laughing he never emailed me to suggest a\
  \ coffee ever again.\n\nBut really I didn\u2019t get a lot written because the trip\
  \ wasn\u2019t panning out like a Hemingway novel but more like a silent experimental\
  \ documentary where I couldn\u2019t pluck up the courage to utter a word except\
  \ when I had a menu in my hand, and really it was easier just to concentrate on\
  \ the ceviche in front of me than brave a proper conversation.\n\nI looked for the\
  \ Signs, the Details that would radiate the Significance of My Trip. I rapturously\
  \ unwrapped tamales, breathed in the scent of the eucalyptus leaves, and tried to\
  \ trade a smile with the man boredly selling plastic dinosaurs on a street corner.\n\
  \nAt this point the mariachi band would pass by in their pink blouses and I would\
  \ sit up fondly, too new to the whole scene to cringe at Piel Canela, then shrink\
  \ with embarrassment as somebody tried to sell me a CD or a necklace. And then the\
  \ mists would part and I\u2019d see myself for what I really was, just another baffled\
  \ tourist in a pair of tights."
