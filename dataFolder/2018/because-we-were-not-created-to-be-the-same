Text: "On a sunny afternoon in the island of Djerba; a small traditional southern\
  \ oasis in Tunisia. The \u201CMedina\u201D felt vulnerable and intimate as it remained\
  \ unfortified. We stumbled upon a Fondouk in the middle of the White and Blue market\
  \ place in Homet Souk. We  as we entered the Fondouk (Hotel of local crafts). Fondouk\
  \ means hotel that is currently is a workshop complex for hand crafts, however it\
  \ used to be the hotel where merchants from all around the mediterranean used to\
  \ reside. \nThere was a man sitting on a bench just next to a stair case. He greeted\
  \ us and asked us if we\u2019d like to check out his palm crafts workshop in the\
  \ second floor. His facial expression was soft and his eyes were full of something\
  \ I didn\u2019t understand; was it curiosity? \nUpstairs, his daughter greeted the\
  \ 3 of us, and showed us around. There were magazine articles on the wall, old photographs\
  \ of Uncle Mohammed\u2019s youth. He was recognised by ambassadors, local authorities\
  \ and a number of tourists that found in his products something different. He was\
  \ talented, it was obvious, the work carried his signature of supreme quality but\
  \ also deep enjoyment of his craft.\nHe sat on the floor to demonstrate the weaving\
  \ process. He gently asked for our names, he guessed right that we were of different\
  \ religions. It felt uncomfortable for a while as he went on and on talking about\
  \ his faith and religious principles and my mom started replying back along the\
  \ same wavelength and it seemed like we\u2019d be hitting a wall but soon the conversation\
  \ winded towards what love means and how we are not able to love each other. Uncle\
  \ Mohammed said:\u201D My sister, you and I think it the same way. It\u2019s been\
  \ 50 years of work, 50 years of God\u2019s blessing...Because I\u2019ve never judged\
  \ a man or a woman. My god, his highness, have a wisdom in diversity. He didn\u2019\
  t create us all the same, we are equal but not the same. He created us different\
  \ and are able to perceive the world in different ways, he sent us different messengers.\
  \ My lord have a wisdom we might ignore but it\u2019s his will and his will is what\
  \ I live by.\u201D\nUncle Mohammed ended the conversation by offering my mother\
  \ a beautiful bread basket as a gift of friendship. The lesson was clear, despite\
  \ his simple life on a small island in the south of Tunisia, he managed to give\
  \ away the secret of harmony and love; acceptance\u2026Embracing differences and\
  \ offering love for all, even if we don\u2019t always understand them."
