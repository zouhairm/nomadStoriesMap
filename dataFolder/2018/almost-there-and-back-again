Text: "\u201CI\u2019ll stay here!\u201D shouts my hiking partner over the powerful\
  \ gusting wind. After four hours of steep and rocky climbing, we can see the summit\
  \ of Avalanche Peak in Arthur\u2019s Pass, New Zealand. We flew 16,550 kilometres\
  \ across the world to get here, and we are about to turn back less than three metres\
  \ in elevation from the summit.\n\nI hesitate beside him. True, the wind is picking\
  \ up to a dangerously high velocity, and people have died on this track. But conditions\
  \ are otherwise good, the path is clear and visible, and the German who passed us\
  \ on his way down said it was doable. Though I did not want to admit it, a nagging\
  \ question had also taken root in my mind: how could I turn back when I was this\
  \ close? \n\n\u201COk, I\u2019m going to go a bit further and try to summit,\u201D\
  \ I say as I start to slowly edge forward along the narrow path. \n\nThis part of\
  \ the track is a razor-blade ridge with sheer drops of 80 metres on either side.\
  \ Though the remaining distance to the peak is short, the track is precarious and\
  \ unforgiving. One misstep combined with a strong gust could be disastrous. \n\n\
  I clutch the steeply dipping beds of grey sandstone on my right, willing myself\
  \ to focus on each step rather than the precipitous fall to a bed of jagged boulders\
  \ on my left. The wind whips wisps of hair around my face, but I continue forward\
  \ in measured, precise steps. The full 360-degree view will be worth it, I tell\
  \ myself. You can do this. One step at a time.\n\nSuddenly I hear the loud call\
  \ of a bird and pause. I look up to see eight flashes of green dancing in the sky,\
  \ the silhouettes of curved beaks clear against the ominously growing clouds\u2014\
  \ kea birds. These intelligent creatures are the world\u2019s only true alpine parrot,\
  \ and thrive in this pristine, mountainous environment. Still stopped, I look across\
  \ the u-shaped valley to my left to see soaring mountains being diligently eroded\
  \ by narrow waterfalls. I take in Crow Glacier to my right, a white monolith resting\
  \ on majestic mount Kaimatau. \n\nThe remainder of Avalanche Peak shrouds whatever\
  \ may lay beyond in mystery, but I make no move forward. Calm passes over me as\
  \ I realize that I am in another hemisphere, on a mountain 1097 (if not 1100) metres\
  \ above the village below, with a 270-degree view of the Southern Alps. Isn\u2019\
  t this what I came here for? Isn\u2019t this enough?\n\nI turn my back on the summit\
  \ and make my way back to down the mountain. Some risks are not worth taking, and\
  \ some journeys are best left unfinished."
