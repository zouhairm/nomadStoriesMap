Text: "After 9 days of walking at high altitude and in severe cold, now I was standing\
  \ at the edge of a 17,600 ft. high ridge. In front of me was a barren yet incredibly\
  \ beautiful landscape, enormous Himalayan range, Khumbu Icefall and an uninhabited\
  \ Everest Basecamp. Even though the basecamp was empty and all I could see of the\
  \ mighty Everest was a little snow covered triangle, yet I felt content and accomplished,\
  \ because getting close to Everest has been my dream for nearly 20 years. Today\
  \ at the age of 50, I had gathered enough courage and confidence to realize this\
  \ dream.\nGrowing up in a landlocked city in India, not only I was far from the\
  \ mountains but hiking and trekking were unknown concept to me. Once I moved to\
  \ USA and were exposed to the idea of hiking, hiking and getting top of a mountain\
  \ to relish incredible views became a favorite activity. When I saw movies/documentaries\
  \ on Everest, I got fascinated by this tallest mountain and when I learned about\
  \ treks to its basecamp, it fueled my desire to get close to this mountain\nBut\
  \ these treks are minimum of 12 days and involve daily 6-8 hours of walking on rough\
  \ trails at high altitude, quite a challenge for me. Growing up I was not athletic\
  \ nor have backpacked before, so for years, I kept hiding my fear of failing on\
  \ this trip behind the excuses such as being busy with raising family, no time to\
  \ train, school vacations do not coincide with the best time to go on this trek.\
  \ I don\u2019t remember how many times I researched the trek itineraries and companies\
  \ organizing these treks but always found an excuse to not go\nAs I approached my\
  \ 50th birthday and desire to be at the base of Everest was still thriving, I made\
  \ the decision, I am going for this trek, I will prepare physically and mentally\
  \ and fully enjoy the journey, whether I reach the basecamp or not. Strict and regular\
  \ fitness routine not only built my endurance but also my confidence that I can\
  \ walk long hours for 12 days straight. Still the breathlessness because of low\
  \ oxygen, severe cold, toilet conditions and using cold water for daily activities\
  \ challenged me every day on this trek\nAt the end, in addition of being physically\
  \ and mentally prepared, five things got me to the Basecamp, the incredible natural\
  \ beauty all along the way, hospitality of the local people, words of my Guide \u201C\
  It\u2019s all mental, the moment you think you cannot do it, you won\u2019t be able\
  \ to go any further\u201D, Diamox, and a cookie which I saved to devour only when\
  \ I reach the basecamp"
