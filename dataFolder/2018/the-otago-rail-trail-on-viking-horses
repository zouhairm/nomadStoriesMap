Text: "The last thing I expected a month ago was to be riding on a Viking horse along\
  \ a rail trail past 30 pig skins draped over a fence. In New Zealand we have a tooth\
  \ brush and a shoe lined fence, but pig skins were new to me. Pig hunting it turns\
  \ out is a local hobby in Otago, New Zealand. \nIn front of me more Viking horses\
  \ carried my companions. Originally this type of horse, Norwegian Fjords, had been\
  \ captured as foals on the plains of Mongolia and transported in longboats by the\
  \ Vikings to Norway. Now the Fjord horses are in New Zealand. We were exploring\
  \ the Otago rail trail, a route typically ridden on bikes, both electric and manual\
  \ with horses. \nI had been drawn to the area since hearing talk of the beauty of\
  \ this wild land. Along the Otago rail trail you can discover old historic gold-mining\
  \ towns, country pubs and rugged scenery. In a couple of areas canyons surrounded\
  \ us and it seemed like we were in a western movie. I could imagine the stage coaches\
  \ and trains both going along this road and bandits taking advantage. The trains\
  \ now are gone and only relics of the times remain. The 145 km from Middlemarch\
  \ to Clyde takes 3-5 days on a bike. On horseback it would take us longer but gave\
  \ us additional time to meet the friendly local people. \nAs we explored the country\
  \ side stopping in the small towns the locals suggested hidden treasures to explore.\
  \ In Hyde we were shown a delightful tiny old building which had been both a mortician\
  \ and farriers. As we rode rugged canyons because rolling hills dotted with sheep.\
  \ Wildflowers in full bloom beside the trail spread along the river. 97 rail bridges\
  \ cross rivers along the rail trail. I am afraid of heights but with that many bridges\
  \ my fear disappeared. \nGreat accommodation and food can be experienced on this\
  \ journey and roughing it is not necessary. Tasty food ranged from historic hotels\
  \ such as the Hyde hotel where we had dinner prepared by the hosts, to pubs with\
  \ great country fare where we sat surrounded by gumboot wearing farmers. Supermarkets\
  \ were in short supply so bring snacks along or in autumn snack upon the many apple\
  \ and pear trees growing track side. Some of our favorite accommodation was Tina\u2019\
  s farmstay, Wedderburn, Hyde hotel and Komako Cottages Waipiata. All of which provided\
  \ paddocks for the horses and a good bed. On Tina\u2019s farm we were also allowed\
  \ to ride around the farm to the highest point along the rail trail. You cannot\
  \ get closer to the sky in this big sky country."
