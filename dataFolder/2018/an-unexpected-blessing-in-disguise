Text: "In the summer of 2017 I had just finished high school and was ready to rediscover\
  \ life apart from the same scheduled days and tiring assignments. So I grabbed a\
  \ friend, boarded a flight to the other side of the world and bought a minivan to\
  \ hit the road. \nHere we were, cruising along the west coast of Canada, sleeping\
  \ on the side of the road, showering in lakes and never knowing where we would spend\
  \ the next night.\nAbout two months into our adventure we decided to stop over in\
  \ Vancouver to get comfy blankets for cold mountain nights. We parked behind a thrift\
  \ store and when we returned everything went really quick \u2013 one second of inobservance,\
  \ a wrong gear shift and BOOM! We hit the wall.\nAfter disbelief uncertainty hit\
  \ me. Would we be able to repair this odd looking car that had become our home in\
  \ the past weeks?\nWe drove to the first workshop we could find. A young woman welcomed\
  \ us, though she immediately explained to us that the insurance would declare our\
  \ van a total loss. However she must have heard the desperateness in our voices,\
  \ so when her boss, a short Asian looking man with a quirky smile, came she suddenly\
  \ changed her mind. Instead of before she explained to him what losing the van would\
  \ mean to us and that he should just make it roadworthy. \nHe glanced at us for\
  \ a long moment and finally agreed to take a look. Only the radiator had experienced\
  \ severe damage and a new one was on its way. Now the only question remaining was\
  \ where we would spend the night. \nIn the absence of a better alternative we asked\
  \ if we could sleep in our car on the grounds of the workshop. When the shop closed,\
  \ we hopped into the front and turned the radio on. We were interrupted by a knock\
  \ on the window and there the boss was, offering each of us a can of beer. A little\
  \ later an employees stopped by and asked us to join the \u2018little party\u2019\
  . We followed him in the shop to a circle of white plastic chairs midst broken cars\
  \ and rusty tools, while the big roller shutter revealed a look on the dark street.\
  \ Sitting on two of the chairs, two men, the boss and a friend were laughing, eating\
  \ and drinking. \nSoon we began talking about our stories - how many years ago two\
  \ friends had left the Vietnam ago to raise a family in a better place and how not\
  \ so long ago another set of two friends had left Germany to explore the world a\
  \ little. More people joined. Sushi was ordered for everyone. More stories, more\
  \ laughter and finally the insight that we were exactly in the right place."
