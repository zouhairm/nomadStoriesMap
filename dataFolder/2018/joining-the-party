Text: "It was a windy but slightly sunny day of February in the most humid region\
  \ on earth. After a four-hour hiking, my group and I finally arrived into the indigenous\
  \ village of Pyrda, in the Khasi Hills of Meghalaya, North-East India. I could see\
  \ the joy in people\u2019s faces. Everyone was really busy because everything had\
  \ to be perfect for the celebration.\n\nMany people dressed up carefully. Fancy\
  \ costumes for kids where made out of old Disney gadgets. There were also paper\
  \ flowers and other decorations crafted by women. Some men were practicing on their\
  \ wooden drums. \n\nAfter some hours, the parade started. It was a beautiful carnival\
  \ day celebration for this Christian population. We were given some leafy branches\
  \ and the handmade paper flowers. I had a lot of fun walking through the mountains\
  \ while trying to sing along their traditional music. A lovely lady from the place\
  \ watched me during the event, ready to push me to sing by gently hitting me with\
  \ her branch when I stopped.\n\nThe parade lasted until the early evening. It was\
  \ interesting to participate in such an important date in this place. That night,\
  \ we stayed at local people\u2019s houses. The experience with my guest family taught\
  \ me that we should share love with all those we care about: I shared the room with\
  \ a new-born lamb that was treated exactly with the same attention and kindness\
  \ as I was, because it was important for them. He slept in the house because it\
  \ was too cold outside.\n\nThe morning after, a warm breakfast that consisted of\
  \ some boiled sweet potatoes and black tea was served for us guests. I was excited\
  \ about what the new day would bring. The second part of the celebration. A moment\
  \ the entire village was looking forward to: the slaughtering of two pigs. On one\
  \ side, men were preparing the animals. On the other, some women placed on the burning\
  \ woods huge pots to boil water for the butchering. The rest of the people were\
  \ setting big tables and cooking rice and other delights.\n\nPork was celebration\
  \ food for them, that is why they were very excited. Those two animals would allow\
  \ an entire village to feast during this special occasion, since meat was an unaffordable\
  \ item, something they would not eat on a regular basis.\n\nI left that place feeling\
  \ very honoured to experience this unconventional mixture of religion and autochthonous\
  \ traditions. I realized that wherever we come from, we are more similar than we\
  \ think. I also learnt that people can be really happy and grateful for the life\
  \ they live."
