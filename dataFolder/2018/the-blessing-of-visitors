Text: "The clinic exam room is sweltering. Miriam, the somehow immaculate Ugandan\
  \ nurse, cracks a dusty window and pulls aside the grimy old curtain that was once\
  \ bright green. There is no breeze.\n\nJust outside sprawls a massive refugee settlement,\
  \ home to 236,000 people. They have fled war and famine in their native South Sudan\
  \ and found sanctuary just across the Ugandan border in the dusty town of Adjumani.\
  \ Here the government provides each of them with a 50-square-meter plot of land\
  \ and the right to stay as long as they need. As an American nurse, I\u2019ve traveled\
  \ here to mentor the dedicated Ugandan medical staff who live at the health center\
  \ that cares for this ever-growing population.\n\nToday has been a slow day. I don\u2019\
  t mind, since it gives me the opportunity to talk with Miriam. The petite young\
  \ woman in bright blue dress scrubs hops up onto the examination table that\u2019\
  s pressed up against the wall beneath the window, settling in to wait until a patient\
  \ arrives. \n\nAt home, I hate small talk. But here in Uganda, asking Miriam about\
  \ her life helps me understand a country I\u2019m only barely getting to know. We\
  \ learn about each other\u2019s families, talk about why we chose to be nurses,\
  \ and laugh about why I don\u2019t braid my hair like hers. I fan myself with my\
  \ little notebook and she teases me because it isn\u2019t even the hot season yet.\
  \ It\u2019s one of the sweetest parts of travel, like a great first date - except\
  \ it\u2019s two countries deciding they might really like each other.\n\nWhen Miriam\
  \ tells me that her hometown isn\u2019t far from where we sit, I ask her gently\
  \ how she feels about having thousands of refugees descend upon her village.\n\n\
  Her face cracks into an easy smile. \u201CHaving visitors is a blessing,\u201D she\
  \ says, as though it\u2019s the most obvious thing in the world.\n\nI\u2019m about\
  \ to ask why she thinks other countries don\u2019t view refugees so favorably, but\
  \ behind her through the window I see a woman making her way towards us. She\u2019\
  s impossibly tall and regal, like so many South Sudanese, but with a rounded belly\
  \ swelling beneath her brightly-colored kitenge. She moves with the signature slow,\
  \ waddling gait of a woman ready to give birth.\n\n\u201CWe have a patient,\u201D\
  \ says Miriam, hopping off the bed. My questions will have to wait for another time.\n\
  \nTo most people, Uganda is only what we see on the news: Elephants, malaria, and\
  \ crushing poverty. But to me, Uganda will always be Miriam: A nation with a brilliant\
  \ grin, intelligent eyes, and arms spread wide to anyone who wants to enter."
