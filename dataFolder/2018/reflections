Text: "The city of Pokhara in Nepal, lies nestled at the foothills of the Annapurna\
  \ Range of the Himalayas. It also lies on the banks of Phewa Lake, fondly known\
  \ as 'the mirror to the Himalayas' for perfectly mirroring the snow-capped peaks\
  \ in its placid waters, and has been the star of a fair share of 'perfect'  Instagram\
  \ posts.\nPaddling a boat in the middle of the river is one of the more popular\
  \ tourist activities, taking hundreds across the lake each day to the little dirt\
  \ trail that leads up to the World Peace Pagoda. The boatmen who take them there\
  \ and their bright multicoloured boats are inseparable from Phewa's charm. \nBut\
  \ today is 31st December, 2017. The tourist lanes of Pokhara are brightly lit up\
  \ with bonfires, their smoke mingling with that of cooking sekuwas, skewered pieces\
  \ of meat over charcoal, a popular delicacy. There are fireworks in the sky; shouts\
  \ and cheers from the revelry echo across the lake. And right now, I'm stuck.\n\n\
  I've missed the last boat back from the trek to the Pagoda, having wandered off\
  \ the dirt trail into the surrounding forest. Yes, I must've taken Robert Frost's\
  \ 'The Road Not Taken' a tad bit seriously and yes, I am stuck. The countdown to\
  \ midnight and the New Year is about to begin and all I can see are the long line\
  \ trails on the sand, left behind by boatmen hurriedly dragging their colourful\
  \ boats into the water to be rowed to the opposite shore. Unexpectedly, a light\
  \ comes on in the ticket booth behind the boating zone, and I'm apprehensive. An\
  \ old woman steps out, holding a small boy, probably her grandson, by the hand,\
  \ to watch the fireworks. They see me there and seconds pass before I walk over\
  \ to them. The little boy is first curious and then, no longer threatened by the\
  \ stranger, is distracted by another explosion of colour in the sky. His grandmother\
  \ indicates a kettle I can finally see in the window behind the ticket booth. \n\
  I sit down next to them, cup of tea in hand, and ring in the New Year, and yes,\
  \ I'm no longer alone. I don't feel quite so stuck anymore. We watch the fireworks\
  \ and the shimmering peaks reflected in 'the mirror to the Himalayas' ."
