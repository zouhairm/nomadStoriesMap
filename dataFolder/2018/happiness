Text: "The sky was painted in orange, while my heart was shaped by the anxiety and\
  \ joy of having landed in Africa. I started with the motto that Inhambane is \"\
  a land of good people\" and, fortunately, I had the privilege of proving it during\
  \ every second that I was in the Catechetical Center of Gui\xFAa (CCG). I was received\
  \ so warmly by everyone that I felt at home and wanted to get my hands on the people\
  \ and the GCC. My days were super filled!\n\nI had the pleasure of collaborating\
  \ in the dynamization of activities in kindergarten, the rehabilitation of the fences\
  \ and the cleaning of some spaces. I updated library inventory. I visited the Guitambatuno\
  \ Secondary School, where I participated in the ceremony of delivery diplomas to\
  \ the young people who finished the computer class. I also collaborated in the delivery\
  \ of baskets to the most disadvantaged families and in the blessing of the houses\
  \ of the communities of Gui\xFAa.\nI was responsible for the computer course. Finally,\
  \ I still collaborated in the execution of the clothing kits for families living\
  \ in the GCC.\nThese were filled days from breakfast to dinner, where I saw a reality\
  \ so different from mine, but where there is a common denominator: joy. It is fascinating\
  \ to meet people who live with the \"machamba\" provides and who spend hours with\
  \ their skin on the sandy soil; children who only drink tea at meals and that use\
  \ machetes to play a sword fight, but who still look at you smiling and are always\
  \ open arms to welcome you and give you a little of their space.\n\nPeople who show\
  \ us that going to Mass is not an obligation, but a daily necessity for the way\
  \ they live Faith, for showing that believing in God with all your heart is the\
  \ only way to be able to live in those conditions and still continue to struggle.\
  \ We have so much to learn from the African people!\n\nI returned with my heart\
  \ bursting through the seams of joy, of affection, of love and with a great desire\
  \ to return. I came back a different person, with new perspectives, a little bit\
  \ of smell, touch, sounds and everything that I learned and grew throughout this\
  \ experience. If you would now give me the opportunity to make a wish, do you know\
  \ what it would be? Back to the people of Gui\xFAa. After all, Africa has something\
  \ magical: the people!\n\n\"Machamba\" - Garden\n\nGui\xFAa, Mozambique\n2015"
