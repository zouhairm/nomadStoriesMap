Text: "One of my most recently discovered passions is to travel. One of my favorite\
  \ trips was to Germany. I am a refugee, originally from Iraq. I had a lot of family\
  \ in Iraq, but unfortunately due to ISIS attacks in that region, my family has been\
  \ displaced. Most of my family is in Germany and I had the opportunity to meet them\
  \ for the first time. I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect. My favorite person was\
  \ one of my cousins, Khairi. The first day we met him was during a train ride from\
  \ Lohmar, Germany to Remscheid, Germany. My sister, Rosheh, and I sat across from\
  \ him, initially we were quite. He gazed out of the window and appeared thousands\
  \ of miles away. I studied his face and wondered what he was thinking about. He\
  \ had strong facial features, high cheek bones and a strong jaw line, which seems\
  \ to run in our family. I asked him how he was liking living in Germany. He started\
  \ telling us stories of home and how he missed it. He missed how care free their\
  \ life seemed in Iraq, before ISIS attacked. He missed the small community he felt\
  \ that he belonged to. He stated that although he missed Iraq, he knew it was unsafe.\
  \ Now, he felt unsettled, as he struggled with the language and worried about finding\
  \ a job. Khairi started telling us funny stories about his step mother, like the\
  \ time she lost a tooth by biting into naan. Then he proceeded by telling us the\
  \ story of the night it happened. He said it was early morning when their family\
  \ was woken up by noises of panic and screams. They went outside to see people desperately\
  \ running out of town, some by foot and others by cars. They knew this was terrible\
  \ news and they had to grab whatever they could and run. He woke his brothers and\
  \ nephews up and luckily their uncle picked them up right as they were leaving their\
  \ home behind. As the car drove down this busy dirt rode, full of screams and panic,\
  \ all you could smell was dry air accumulated with dirt and car fuel. They made\
  \ the harsh journey into Turkey. They knew that their best chance at a better life\
  \ was to cross the deadly sea from Turkey into Greece. Khairi was able to convince\
  \ this woman that smuggled immigrants across the sea to allow for his family\u2019\
  s passage way as he had no money to pay for their way. Unsure of their destiny,\
  \ he knew this was their best chance of a better life. \n\nI did not expect my visit\
  \ to Germany to be of this learning experience; to hear their stories, to have them\
  \ share these life changing experiences with me. That was humbling."
