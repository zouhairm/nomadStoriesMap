Text: "We leave the animal rescue centre in a dirty old pickup truck. Fredrico manoeuvres\
  \ around the many potholes on the narrow jungle road as if it had been his own backyard.\
  \ In his strong Costa Rican Spanish he tells me that we are going to pick up an\
  \ injured sloth found by the roadside. \n\nAbout an hour later, Fredrico parks the\
  \ car and we get out into the tropical air. A bald man covered in tattoos comes\
  \ up to us and I follow their conversation as well as I can with my broken Spanish.\
  \ It was the family\u2019s dog who found the sloth and nobody knows how long it\u2019\
  s been there for. \n\nThree young girls are eager to show it to us and we follow\
  \ them over to the shelter of palm leaves they\u2019ve improvised to keep the poor\
  \ animal out of the midday sun. I can hear myself swallow when I see it: unmoving\
  \ with one furry arm across its head as if to protect itself and both eyes clogged\
  \ shut. \n\n\u201CProbably a car accident\u201D, Fredrico says, \u201Ca lot of animals\
  \ get run over by cars these days.\u201D \n\nI look at the sloth, surprised by the\
  \ lack of blood.\n\nThe tattooed man agrees. His worry for the sloth is genuine\
  \ and he waves away a few of the many curious children around us. I get the transport\
  \ cage, a lump growing in my stomach as I wonder how much pain the poor animal must\
  \ be in. \n\nWhen Fredrico lifts it up, the sloth finally reacts. It slowly reaches\
  \ out its arms and wriggles, arching its back in a weak effort to get away. It makes\
  \ a heart wrenching screaming noise and I can see how its fur has fallen off in\
  \ many places, leaving whitish skin exposed. We put it in the cage, then cover it\
  \ with a blanket to minimise the trauma of travelling. \n\nWe are going to bring\
  \ it to the vet, another hour of travelling north along the coast. The man with\
  \ tattoos gives his number to Fredrico, demanding rather than asking to be called\
  \ back with any news about the sloth. This injured animal has touched the entire\
  \ street, it seems. \n\nFredrico and I climb back into the hot and dusty car. We\
  \ are going to spend almost six hours of driving today, from the rescue centre in\
  \ the jungle-clad mountains to a nameless street in a small beach village to a veterinary\
  \ clinic in an American resort, all to try and save a sloth found in a ditch. \n\
  \nThe sloth is a reminder of what happens when human expansion clashes with nature,\
  \ even in a country like Costa Rica that cares so much about wildlife. But then\
  \ there are people like Fredrico, the people who try so hard to make the clash as\
  \ gentle as possible."
