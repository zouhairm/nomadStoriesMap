Text: "Our shadows, side by side, are revelling in the peace and serenity of one of\
  \ the most tranquil beaches of Goa, a poet\u2019s paradise known for its sky changing\
  \ colors and sun settings. A cool breeze makes me tighten my shawl as Krishna controls\
  \ a shiver. Two adolescents hurtle down the shore, followed by a third astride his\
  \ motorbike. These prancing peacocks have disrupted the blissful quietude. As abruptly\
  \ as they appeared, they vanish into the darkness. On the other side of the estuary,\
  \ Chopra fort is looming above the Chopdem River. As night creeps over the strand,\
  \ the tide slowly rises.\n\nGiddy from the previous night\u2019s festivities, I\
  \ teased the fencing cars and motorbikes on stand-by, mischievously playing them\
  \ up against each other before succumbing to the siren\u2019s call. I couldn\u2019\
  t keep my excitement in check as we navigated a sea of noise and smell. \n\nSuddenly,\
  \ my driver turned onto a hidden dirt track. The scent of pines mixed with soft\
  \ notes of asafoetida and lingering curry drifted through the air as I was propelled\
  \ against him and slid back towards the rear. In the distance, line upon line of\
  \ wild, lush, jungle-clad hills veiled the extravagant, gregarious vestiges of its\
  \ colonial past.\n\nAs we neared my destination, he asked hostile figures to confirm\
  \ our location to no avail. We circled the block, passing run-down shacks and dumping\
  \ grounds for used cars. On either side of the main drag, the shops, even though\
  \ small and dingy, had big, bright signboards under which sprawled depressed-looking,\
  \ dark-skinned baba puffing chillums.\n\nFor a fleeting moment, waves of fear threatened\
  \ to cloud my judgement. I was a woman travelling alone with no friends around and\
  \ no answer from the hotel but a phone off the hook, tailed by baying fire pariah\
  \ dogs. From deep within, awkward euphoria spilled out, blossoming into joyful laughter\
  \ chasing my doubts away while a plan started to make shape. However, Krishna was\
  \ one step ahead. After a few phone calls, the journey in reverse, I found myself\
  \ amidst clean white sheets, pampered and waited upon like a princess. Krishna left,\
  \ promising to call on me after his shift, a prelude to our gazing upon the Arabian\
  \ Sea."
