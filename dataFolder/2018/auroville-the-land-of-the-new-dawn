Text: "\u201CA town where there is no money?\u201D I had asked in disbelief when I\
  \ first heard about it.\n\nA place where people lived without money along with modern\
  \ technology had piqued my curiosity.\n\nI pack my bags and leave for this town\
  \ in Southern India.\nI begin to wonder how such a place came into being and luckily\
  \ I do have an appointment with Thomas, who has been in Auroville since the very\
  \ beginning which was in 1968.\n\n\u201CThis place was a desert, a result of massive\
  \ deforestation. Nothing could grow on this land when we first started to build\
  \ this town\u201D Explains Thomas. I can\u2019t but help notice the sense of achievement\
  \ in his eyes. \n\n\u201CThose were times then. It took us many years to get the\
  \ trees to grow. And with it, came the wild life\u201D said Thomas while offering\
  \ me some Himalayan tea..\nIt had taken them years to make Auroville a livable place,\
  \ with enough water and trees.\n\n\u201CLet us go meet a friend\u201D suggested\
  \ Thomas and we hop on to our bicycles and make our way to Richard\u2019s home.\n\
  \nIt\u2018s quite a sight when Richard and Thomas meet.  Two sixty odd year old\
  \ men laughing and greeting each other like children raised my spirits to another\
  \ level.  There\u2019s some sort of purity in their connection. I realize that there\
  \ is an air of contentment among most people there. Something that says they wouldn\u2019\
  t want to be anywhere else in the world. \nI listen to their stories for the next\
  \ couple of hours and head for lunch to the local canteen known as the Solar Kitchen.\
  \ The kitchen mostly solar powered and I see many Aurovillian eating there. We seat\
  \ ourselves at a community table, eating the food that is grown within the town.\
  \ The conversations mostly revolve around the recent rains that destroyed many roads\
  \ and crops. \n\nThis is followed  by nice swim in the local mud pool and visit\
  \ to a school where the local children have just completed building a treehouse.\
  \ It's a sight to see RIchard and Thomas climb up. \nLater, we have a quiet dinner\
  \ under the full moon and call it a night and bid our goodbyes\nIt's time to go\
  \ home now and I have a quick shower and hit the bed. I stare at the ceiling and\
  \ thoughts about the day fill my head. The people here had a lot of free time and\
  \ don't seem to be in a rush. I think about Thomas and how sweet it was of him to\
  \ show me around. Though I knew I would come back as day is not enough in a place\
  \ like this.\nIn the morning, I find a note that read, \n\"Until next time, Thomas\"\
