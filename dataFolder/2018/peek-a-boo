Text: "In line at the customs counter, my head bobs slightly.  I blink to try to focus\
  \ on something so my vision clears.  The antihistamine I\u2019d taken before my\
  \ first flight still has its vice-like grip on my senses.  Is my suitcase rolling\
  \ forward because I\u2019m leaning on it?  Further ahead, a baby fusses while his\
  \ mother tries to console him - fatigue etched all over her face.  In my current\
  \ stupor I just barely register the activity around me.  As I wait, self-doubt snakes\
  \ its way into my consciousness, pulling my focus away from the Ukraine Airport\
  \ Customs queue.  The realization that I am \u201Cboomeranging\u201D home a second\
  \ time creeps into focus and my thoughts start to spin.  \n\nWhen I was little I\u2019\
  d always dreamed of traveling, writing, and making art. I would tell anyone who\u2019\
  d listen that I wanted to live abroad.  It was rare that I would mention a specific\
  \ destination; I couldn\u2019t pick just one.  The childhood conception of my grown-up\
  \ lifestyle was so engrained in my psyche that my mum was not surprised when I told\
  \ her I had accepted a position to teach in China.  Now here I am, stuck in a foreign\
  \ customs line in a drug-fueled malaise, emotionally and technologically cut off\
  \ from those who could possibly help to assuage my bruised ego.  The fussy baby\
  \ starts to wail.\n\nI\u2019m not sure what exactly cuts through the fog in my brain.\
  \  I watch the mother finagle moving her suitcase through the line, and in the same\
  \ motion attempt to calm her little boy.  The other passengers ignore their plight.\
  \  My stare catches the baby\u2019s attention.  He hesitates.  I take both my hands\
  \ and slowly bring them in front of my face.  His anticipation is palpable as I\
  \ hear his breath hitch.\n\n\u201CNi kan baby!\u201D\n\nI pop my hands to the sides,\
  \ smiling broadly at the little boy.  He\u2019s stopped crying, confused.  My hands\
  \ quickly snap back in front of my face.  The boy\u2019s mother looks over her shoulder,\
  \ watching me as I make strange faces at her baby.  I keep up my game of peek-a-boo.\
  \  \u201CNi hao ma baby?\u201D\n\nI can visibly see the mother\u2019s tension evaporate\
  \ as the boy\u2019s face wrinkles into a wide toothless grin.  I smile and wave.\
  \  The boy\u2019s mother moves his hand up and down to wave back.  She smiles at\
  \ me.  I know no more Chinese, and yet, I can read it all over her face: \u201C\
  Thank you.\u201D  \n\nMy thought-spiral stops.  Sure, I\u2019m moving back home\
  \ again.  But I\u2019ll keep traveling; continue pursuing my childhood dream.  And\
  \ as I do, I hope I can keep making people smile."
