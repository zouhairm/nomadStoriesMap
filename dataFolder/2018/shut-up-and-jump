Text: "The Makarska Riviera stretches her shores along the Adriatic Sea, under the\
  \ towering mountains that surround her like a fortress. On a hazy midsummer day\
  \ she welcomes a group of thirty young travellers. We arrive from all corners of\
  \ the world and make a pact to sail along the islands and live the next seven days\
  \ as youth in rebellion: fearless, wild, and obedient to our impulses.\n\nWe step\
  \ into the warm sunlight and walk the cobblestoned streets as soon as the day breaks.\
  \ The ground burns under our bare feet so we seek shade under the palm trees. After\
  \ we exit a never-ending labyrinth of alleyways and bars we finally make it to the\
  \ shores of the Croatian coast. There, we mark our spot on a rock formation near\
  \ the water by throwing down our rucksacks and clothes. On a diet of soft serve\
  \ ice cream and Fanta, we spend the day seeking thrills in the water.\_\n\nWe are\
  \ too wild to stand still and too naive to be afraid of the consequences, so my\
  \ reckless allies vow to immortalize today by bungee jumping over the Adriatic.\
  \ One by one they soar, their screams of elation echoing through the Riviera. Before\
  \ the sun sets, I want to be among them-but my fear grounds me to the sands, delaying\
  \ the inevitable. \n\n\u201CAre you going to jump?\u201D my best friend Aneseh asks\
  \ pointing above us. \n\u201CI will if you will\u201D I say boldly, trying to hide\
  \ my nerves.\nShe gets up without hesitation and ten minutes later she is gracefully\
  \ swinging above the water, her body twirling in elegant spirals held only by a\
  \ chord. I have no choice but to follow. My fear can wait.  \n\nI try to find my\
  \ courage and before I know it, I am overlooking the glittering sea from a bird\u2019\
  s eye view. I feel my body betraying me and I start shaking. So this is what true\
  \ fear is like. Huh\n\n\u201CWill I be okay?\u201D I ask the instructor looking\
  \ for encouragement. \u201CI don\u2019t know\u201D he shrugs nonchalantly with half\
  \ a smile, \u201Cbut we can go back down if you like\".I don\u2019t brother replying.\
  \ Instead, I close my eyes and the adrenaline takes over my body like a parasite.\
  \ It\u2019s intoxicating. At last I let go, and plummet towards the water.\_\n\n\
  Somewhere between a dream and consciousness I open my eyes again and see the mountains\
  \ moving back and forth and the ground spinning under me. Thirty feet below, my\
  \ wild crew is screaming my name and shouting words I can\u2019t understand. As\
  \ I begin my descent I take the time to look around me. I don\u2019t think about\
  \ what I did yesterday and where I will be tomorrow. I am here now-young, reckless\
  \ and alive."
