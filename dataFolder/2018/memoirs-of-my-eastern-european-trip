Text: "When I started travelling to Europe in 2014, my Asian family and friends back\
  \ in the Philippines were so thrilled I'll be seeing the Eiffel Tower in Paris,\
  \ the Vatican in Rome, etc. France, Germany, Spain, Italy, and other western countries\
  \ in Europe are popular with them and they have high recommendations and praises\
  \ every photo I posted on my Instagram and Facebook account. I love history and\
  \ became obsessed about the history and cultural differences between East and West\
  \ Europe.\nAlong my exploration, I also met a lot of people from different backgrounds\
  \ and when I was about to roam Eastern Europe, such as Bosnia, Serbia, Albania,\
  \ Slovakia etc., they advised me to never go alone in Eastern Europe. These countries,\
  \ according to them are very poor, dangerous, and they will rip me off into my core.\
  \ My family and friends did not even know some countries in Eastern Europe that\
  \ existed. I was shocked and wondered why?\nWhy such many negative impressions to\
  \ those countries, historically, were victims of such war and colonisation of the\
  \ Western World? I understood the concerns, but I always believe wherever I go in\
  \ the world, there are always dangers in it, hence, Eastern Europe is no difference.\
  \ \nI just smiled at those peoples concerned, and I firmly said,' to see is to believe!'...\
  \ and I was right! The countries in Eastern Europe are very beautiful and the people\
  \ are very lovely, approachable, modest, and have a colourful history, cultures\
  \ and traditions.\nYes, it is indeed that the region is poor compared to the western\
  \ side of Europe. It is also true that this side was the pioneer of WWI when Archduke\
  \ Franz Ferdinand of Austria, heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary was assassinated\
  \ by Yugoslav nationalist Gavrilo Princip circa 1914 in Saravejo, Bosnia; the separation\
  \ of the Yugoslavia and the Balkan states in the 1995 and the other bloody wars\
  \ in the past, but all the countries in the world have the blood y history of wars\
  \ - what's the difference then? \nThus, Albania is a mesmerising country and has\
  \ a fascinating historical background that many people in the world don't know because\
  \ of their negative insight based on what they heard and seen in the past, but they\
  \ forgot to think that there are always two sides of the coin and sad to say, they\
  \ have refused to see it. \nI was very fortunate and privileged for the historical\
  \ wonderment I experienced during my trips. I learned so much, and it proved to\
  \ me a lot of things beyond my expectations and others as well."
