Text: "That morning in July 2015 I decided to buy a ticket to Northwestern Sumba,\
  \ a small region in NTT- Eastern Indonesia. I had two goals; to visit Tosi Kodi,\
  \ an old village and escape from busy city of Jakarta. \nThe sound of alarm on my\
  \ phone rang, seemed to wake anyone at the hotel where I stayed. I was a little\
  \ surprised and sulky, but happy that could be awakened early. I drew the curtains\
  \ off and from my window I could see the bluest sky ever. I thought of getting up\
  \ early and go. Together with Ndaru, my local guide and driver, we were heading\
  \ to the location of Tosi Kodi Village. \nIt didn\u2019t take long to get to this\
  \ location but the road we took was an issue. it was badly damaged. The sky on our\
  \ way was so stunningly beautiful. clouds slightly paraded on the blue sky with\
  \ the sun rises in the east. they seemed to embrace us. Ndaru and I started off\
  \ a conversation. Ndaru was 27 years old at that time and He is originally from\
  \ Tosi Kodi village. I was being judgemental when I met him for the first time.\
  \ his look and the way he talks were too strange for me. As the conversation progressed,\
  \ it turned out that Ndaru is a nice person and very knowledgeable. \nWhen arrived\
  \ at the village, I was stunned by its scenary. The village is surrounded by long\
  \ coast of Sumba, on the other side forest and stone hill are so cradling. Every\
  \ house was built traditionally from wood and roof was made of hay completed with\
  \ stone tombs in the front yard. it reminded me of the stone age era. \nNdaru introduced\
  \ me to the leader of the village. we talked on the stone near the estuary of river\
  \ and  ocean overlooking white sandy beach. meanwhile on the coast edge there are\
  \ some of ancestral tombs aged thousand years. The massive blocks of rock that cover\
  \ the tombs stored unexplored mysteries. We talked almost an hour until Ndaru brought\
  \ me to the main house where local people; mothers, fathers, kids gathered and did\
  \ special welcome for me. \nNdaru asked me to dance together while other enchanted\
  \ a traditional prayers wishing that their ancestors accept my visit. Tosi Kodi\
  \ people celebrate life everyday by singing and dancing. They told me that life\
  \ should be embraced with joy and happiness. Before leaving the village I was given\
  \ a kiss by a mother named Sika. She was the oldest. people say her kiss means good\
  \ fortune and will bring me back to revisit the village. On my way back to the hotel,\
  \ I just realized that my trip to Tosi Kodi is more than just an escape. It gave\
  \ me an experience."
