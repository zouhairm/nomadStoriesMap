Text: "Making a local connection\n\nRyan says he has a surprise for me. He mentions\
  \ we are about to cross Kootenay Lake but it\u2019s too long to cross it by a bridge.\
  \ We take the ferry from Kootenay Bay to Balfur in British Columbia, Canada. We\
  \ get out of the car and go to the deck. The ride in the Osprey 2000 is astounding.\
  \ It\u2019s cold, but a good cold. I always complain about the cold weather, the\
  \ temperature, the moisture and wind-chill (everything), but this time it is different.\
  \ The snow capped mountains look majestic behind the endless blue lake that echoes\
  \ some small waves that splash as the snow falls in slow motion on the deck. I take\
  \ a deep breath and when I exhale my body relaxes and my mind gets oblivious about\
  \ the obstacles I encountered at work. I tend to overthink and analyze too much,\
  \ in this boat my worries abandon me voluntarily.\n\nWe arrive at Ainsworth Hot\
  \ Springs. As I go out from the restroom my eyes catch the natural steam coming\
  \ out from the pool. I run to the pool to look for Ryan. He points at a monitor\
  \ where we see information about Ainsworth Hot Springs, a place that has restorative\
  \ mineral waters to heal mind, body and soul. In the past, the Ktunaxa people gathered\
  \ here after a long day of hunting, collecting berries and fishing. We go through\
  \ the warm cave where we could hear water drops echoing through the whole stone\
  \ structure. Ryan and I choose a spot, lie down and close our eyes. It is just relaxing\
  \ just to have a quiet mind full of loud and clear thoughts. I loose myself up in\
  \ body and mind.  Maybe I need to be more kind to the comments I say to myself.\
  \ I need to let situations flow like the warm water flows through the cave. I need\
  \ to make a better local connection with myself to acknowledge my worth, my virtues\
  \ and achievements. I will be enamored with my own story, feeling great in own skin\
  \ and being happy of being me.We have been in the cave for three straight hours\
  \ and our fingers are very wrinkly. My perspective has changed. I\u2019m thankful\
  \ there has always being a helping hand from a family member or a friend when facing\
  \ an obstacle and sooner or later I\u2019ll turn it around. Ainsworth Hot Springs\
  \ is the best meditation practice, mindfulness session, psychological therapy and\
  \ way to connect with your true self."
