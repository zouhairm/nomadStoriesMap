Text: "Thick, sloping rain is engulfing my vision. Blinking the warm water away, I\
  \ make out a blur of green. Something sharp pokes me forcefully on my right cheek.\
  \ \u2018James!\u2019 I admonish the person sitting next to me. He twists his neck\
  \ to squint in my direction. \u2018Oh, sorry! I... it was my crown\u2019 he shouts,\
  \ in a tone that suggests both sincerely apology and mild surprise. A large, spiky\
  \ garland of coconut tree leaves adorns his head, and has temporarily invaded my\
  \ personal space. To my left, a Vietnamese lady is singing monotonically at the\
  \ top of her lungs. This sound is punctuated only by her own booming laugh, a noise\
  \ at complete discord with her soft, weathered features. Balancing a large oar in\
  \ her left hand, she lunges at one of the nearby coconut palms that are flanking\
  \ us on all sides, and seizes several leaves. Whilst simultaneously steering and\
  \ rowing, she fashions the foliage into an elaborate bracelet. This is an addition\
  \ clearly meant to compliment my own crown which, I muse wryly, rivals James\u2019\
  \ in both height and intricacy. \u2018I feel like I\u2019m in a scene from Apocalypse\
  \ Now!, James remarks loudly over the furore, snapping me back to the present. I\
  \ nod in agreement. \n We are being steered along the Mekong Delta, in a boat largely\
  \ akin to a wooden bowl. Having set out expecting to cycle the regions around H\u1ED9\
  i An in Vietnam, neither of us had anticipated a detour through Bay Mau Coconut\
  \ Forest 5km away, let alone one involving our own\u2026 coronation. I had read\
  \ about this area\u2019s complex history. In a past life, the forest had provided\
  \ a base to the Viet Cong, a national liberalisation army which had emerged victorious\
  \ in the Vietnam War. The surrounding vegetation morphs in my imagination, taking\
  \ on a host of new meanings. Camouflage. Protection. Power. I yearn to probe our\
  \ navigational companion, to discover more about her own journey. Yet, she is happily\
  \ engrossed in her task of keeping us afloat in the downpour, and I am hesitant\
  \ to disrupt this reverie. Several minutes later we reach a river bank and glide\
  \ to a halt. The rain has subsided and the delta has restored itself to an eerie\
  \ stillness. \u2018What is your name?\u2019 I implore of our guide. This I must\
  \ know, at least. She looks at me, grinning broadly. Slowly raising her left hand\
  \ in the air, she says nothing but holds two fingers up to form a \u2018V\u2019\
  \ shape \u2013 peace. I clamber out of the boat, feeling contemplative and humbled.\
  \ I sense that she has shared more with me in that gesture than words could express."
