Text: "Dear Alberto,\n\nI keep laughing to myself when I remember you saying \u2018\
  coo coo.\u2019 Trying to help me understand the cheese you had presented me with\
  \ our language barrier. Sorry I was a bit slow on the uptake - of course it was\
  \ cow. I just felt a bit disorientated, a bit like I was observing from outside\
  \ my body. I can\u2019t blame this on any kind of jet lag, considering Italy is\
  \ a 1 hour time difference to my native London. It was actually more the opposite.\
  \ Driving down the windy roads, through the pretty villages of Barolo, I felt such\
  \ awe to my surroundings - how nature could be so useful, but also so beautiful.\
  \ My favourite view point was from the village La Morra, where the vineyards stretch\
  \ out to the horizon. The vines looked so dormant from their winter hibernation;\
  \ it\u2019s incredible to think of them blossoming to life in a month, growing the\
  \ grapes that will become such extraordinary wines. When I reached you I was dazed\
  \ from the wonder of it all. But then, through your kind, patient wine tasting,\
  \ you grounded me and helped me to properly understand. I\u2019m very sorry to hear\
  \ the story about your father\u2019s sudden death on the tractor, how this meant\
  \ you and your brother would be grounded in Barolo for ever, running the family\
  \ winery. I found you so stoic and felt guilty at the feeling of claustrophobia\
  \ that swept over me when I imagined living in the same place for 30 years, going\
  \ to school only 10 metres away. But you were so content, so witty, so cultured.\
  \ You made me reflect what life is about and why I like to travel. For adventure,\
  \ to meet new people, to gain knowledge and to give meaning to my life; you seemed\
  \ to have achieved this all from your home town. When it comes to drinking delicious\
  \ wine, people talk of light-bulb moments, moments when everything seems to come\
  \ in to place. And from trying your wines, with a view of the vineyards the grapes\
  \ were picked from, tasting the local \u2018coo\u2019 cheese, I had this moment.\
  \ I felt the history, the culture, the tradition and the importance of these wines;\
  \ I knew I was in the right place at that particular moment. I felt your contentedness.\
  \ Your wines will travel all over the world, from Australia, to Japan, to Sweden;\
  \ different people with their own cultures and own histories will be drinking the\
  \ same wine, and although I\u2019ll never meet these people, I like to think of\
  \ them too having a light-bulb moment. Drinking your wine makes us all connected.\n\
  \ \nThank you so much for such an eye-opening visit,\n\nAnna"
