Text: "At 3am the shrill sound of my phone\u2019s alarm woke me out of what felt like\
  \ a five-minute nap. Any other day and I would have buried my head into my pillow\
  \ and slept an eternity. Today however, grand things lay ahead because I\u2019d\
  \ organised a hot air balloon ride over the Nile to watch the sunrise. \nI boarded\
  \ a small speedboat that was decorated with coloured tassels and intricately woven\
  \ rugs as I journeyed from East Bank to West. I dozed off slightly, which I owe\
  \ partly to the fact that the only light was that of the moon\u2019s reflection\
  \ on the water\u2019s surface and that I was immensely tired. It was all very relaxing.\
  \ I\u2019m not to blame.\nWe drove down a winding, bumpy road, catching glimpses\
  \ of signs that read \u2018Valley of the Kings\u2019 and keeping our heads down\
  \ to avoid hitting them against the roof of the van. We came to a stop that lay\
  \ not too far from Hatshepsut\u2019s temple (something everyone else seemed weirdly\
  \ calm about) and exited the vehicle only to be surrounded by large deflated balloons\
  \ and balls of fire shooting into the sky.\nI imagined this to be what the backstage\
  \ of a Russian circus looked like, except with large men in leopard print leotards\
  \ and well-grown moustaches, rather than a group of Egyptian men in sandals and\
  \ jeans screaming at each other in Arabic.\nOur hot air balloon fit 13 people, including\
  \ the pilot. Having never been in one before, it felt unusual being slowly lifted\
  \ off the ground in a basket with a balloon over my head. But I went with it.\n\
  Beneath us lay the wonders of Ancient Egypt and in the distance, an orange sun that\
  \ rose slowly from its slumber. The Nile River looked majestic, the sugar cane crops\
  \ rich and the temples grand. \nI was living out a reality that seemed too good\
  \ to be true. \n\u201CEVERYBODY DOWN!\u201D the pilot shouted.\nFunny. I thought\
  \ to myself. I wondered why the sugar canes were suddenly at eye level.\nAs we crash-landed\
  \ people gasped, others shrieked and some panicked, but we were met with a smiling\
  \ pilot who proclaimed exuberantly: \u201CDon\u2019t worry, be happy!\u201D\nI knew\
  \ that my mother would have shaken her head at the situation, but the sudden turn\
  \ of events made for an unexpected rescue and a leisurely stroll through a small\
  \ village, which in my books is more experience than I could have ever asked for.\
  \ \nAnd that is how I found myself on the banks of the Nile River; bathing in the\
  \ first light of day and laughing with two young Egyptian boys who found the mess\
  \ we were in just as hilarious, just as exciting and just as beautiful."
