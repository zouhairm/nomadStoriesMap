Text: "In Chicken, Alaska, this punch line is hilarious: \u201CThere are people who\
  \ are scared of their own shadows. Those guys,\u201D she said, her voice with the\
  \ silkiness and wisdom of Meryl Streep, \u201Care chickens.\u201D\n\nThe entire\
  \ caf\xE9 of a dozen people laughed. The woman they call Chicken Sue wore her wispy,\
  \ golden hair in a sweat-stained navy blue bandana, and she spoke a mile-a-minute,\
  \ a caricature holding court up in the far northern reaches of Alaska. I first heard\
  \ about her from a family driving their camper from Denver to Alaska, then from\
  \ a Kiwi who had, eleven months ago, begun his trip in Patagonia and was closing\
  \ in on the Arctic Circle. I, too, was on my from Alaska to LA when I made an impulsive\
  \ turn that led me, a two day detour, here.\n\n\u201CYou\u2019re famous in Anchorage,\u201D\
  \ a girl in the caf\xE9 said.\n\nChicken Sue laughed, \u201CApparently, I\u2019\
  m famous in the Netherlands too! Hey, who won the game?\u201D \n\nChicken, Alaska,\
  \ is a hamlet of 15 permanent residents, a number that swells up to about 50 people\
  \ during the summer. For about 100 miles each way, neither road into Chicken is\
  \ paved, and the townspeople like to say that paving will come the day pigs learn\
  \ to fly. So, that\u2019s Chicken: an American gold rush town bent on making a mockery\
  \ of itself, holding onto a quirky summer romance with miners dreaming of gold and\
  \ adventurous souls braving the harrowing Top of the World Highway into Canada.\
  \ The joke began in 1901 when the original settler wanted to name their town \u201C\
  Ptarmigan\u201D, after a chicken-like bird the settlers survived on. But no one\
  \ knew the correct spelling. Not wanting their town to become a source of ridicule,\
  \ the town of Chicken came into being.\n\nSince then, the caf\xE9 has churned with\
  \ laughter. Chicken Sue directs toilet seekers to the outhouse called Chicken Poop.\
  \ The only bar in town burns panties and hangs them from the ceiling. There is a\
  \ giant statue of a chicken, with signposts that point to towns such as \u201CChicken\
  \ Scratch, NC\u201D and \u201CCockadoodle, Australia.\u201D \n\n\u201CHey,\u201D\
  \ Chicken Sue shouted to a man in greased overall. \"You! Who won the softball game?\u201D\
  \n\nFairbanks, he said. And Chicken Sue wailed and hooted and high-fived anyone\
  \ within reach. She said, \u201CThat\u2019s my hometown, baby. Didn\u2019t we also\
  \ win last year?\u201D Then she looked at the man in front of her. \u201CWait, why\
  \ didn\u2019t you win? Are you a chicken?\u201D\n\nThe caf\xE9 cracked up again.\
  \ Out here, at the edge of our world, it was a century-old joke that never got old,\
  \ I thought, chewing on the tastiest chicken potpie I\u2019ve ever had."
