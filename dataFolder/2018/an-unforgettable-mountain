Text: "Travelling down a dusty gravel road in Namibia, a hump was before us hundreds\
  \ of kilometers away. I never expected this hump to be the greatest most surreal\
  \ night of my life.\n\nStaring out the window I was greeted by a clear blue sky\
  \ of peace and calmness. Under this sky was a burnt landscape that the sun had spent\
  \ minutes, hours, days and years to color a tan brown like a golden retriever. It\
  \ was surprising to see life in this burnt, quiet landscape. Ostriches loved the\
  \ dusty baron land. They did not love the dust flying in their direction from our\
  \ roaring truck speeding past. The ostriches scattered from this unwelcome disturbance,\
  \ dancing with grace as they ran. I was mesmerized by their movements, allowing\
  \ my eyes to follow every leg turn and feather flap - all from my air-conditioned\
  \ seat in the truck.\n\nThe hump turned into a mound. Into a hill. Into a mountain.\
  \ Every kilometer closer I had to rise my head a little more to catch the peak.\
  \ This was to be our home for the night.\n\nOur truck sped under the impressive\
  \ rock formations, what had happened 120 million years ago to create such a place?\
  \ \n\nWe had arrived to Spitzkoppe. I hopped off the truck, mid afternoon, from\
  \ a cool air conditioned climate into the oppressive beating heat of the sun. Instinctively\
  \ my hands shaded my eyes from the glaring intensity of the sun, momentarily forgetting\
  \ my surroundings. I felt what Spitzkoppe had been feeling for millions of years.\n\
  \nAs if reading my mind, our guide begun to give us a history of this place. His\
  \ animated story telling grabbed and held my attention. He demonstrated with his\
  \ arms how the rock had been sculpted from the climate, winds and rain. This African\
  \ man knew how to tell stories. His sparkling, smiling eyes held a passion for this\
  \ place.\n\nAs the day grew to an end, the brilliant never ending blue sky gave\
  \ way to an orange tear that started to appear above the burning ball of fire. The\
  \ sun was still too bright to look at directly. The way the sky made way for its\
  \ departure was like how a Spanish Torero makes way for a bull. I didn\u2019t have\
  \ time to blink. The orange color spread out far and wide, with brilliant pinks\
  \ and deep reds. These were colors with life. The sun descended into oblivion and\
  \ then the vibrant purples and deep blues mixed with the oranges, pinks and reds.\
  \ I stared into the silence, until all the colors had given way to the encroaching\
  \ night. They only had a short time to make their impression upon me. But I will\
  \ never forget them."
