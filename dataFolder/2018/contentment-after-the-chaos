Text: "I briskly walked away from the lake, tired of fake Brahmin priests offering\
  \ me a \u201Cblessing\u201D. I felt exasperated from being pulled, pushed and prodded\
  \ by little girls in ostentatious gypsy costumes with painted white faces demanding,\
  \ \u201Cmoney, money, money!\u201D and aggressive henna artists who grabbed my hand\
  \ without permission, expecting a handsome payment for an uninvited design. \n\n\
  I ran up the ghat stairs and disappeared down a littered alleyway in an attempt\
  \ to find refuge from the bustling marketplace. The smell of urine and incense overtook\
  \ my senses. Amidst the maze of stalls and small streets, I missed the road to my\
  \ guesthouse. I stopped at a clothing stall to take a breath and re-orient myself.\
  \ \n\n\u201CLooking for something?\u201D a husky, warm voice inquired. \n\nI searched\
  \ for the face belonging to this friendly voice. He was smiling. Sparkly eyes and\
  \ full cheeks, peering up from behind an old Singer sewing machine, surrounded by\
  \ piles of colorful fabric.\n\n\u201CActually I\u2019m not looking for anything.\
  \ I just wanted to rest for a moment\u201D. I started to explain how I came to be\
  \ standing in his shop.\n\nHe motioned for me to sit. \u201CChai?\u201D\n\nBy now\
  \ I was familiar with the drill. I\u2019d probably spend the next hour or so talking\
  \ and drinking sweet chai. I settled with content. Mukand was kind with a wild streak\
  \ and I detected that enclosed in the complexity of his being was a deep sadness\
  \ that later he would reveal.\n \nThe following evening we sat on the rooftop of\
  \ The Palace Hotel, sipping tea and telling stories, with a view of Pushkar Lake.\
  \ Its still, glassy surface twinkled with the reflection of the city lights. In\
  \ the distance, the sound of wedding music coincided with the story of his arranged\
  \ marriage. I was curious and troubled by this Indian tradition and listened intently\
  \ as he shared. The sorrow that I\u2019d sensed earlier seeped out as he spoke.\
  \ \n\n\"I was 24 when my mother introduced me to my wife. At first, I ran away.\
  \ For weeks I was gone. But I came back and married her to honor my mother.\"\n\n\
  The wedding procession came down the street. Horns and drums blared as family and\
  \ friends danced and sang. The groom paraded around on a costumed horse. \n\n\u201C\
  Did you enjoy your wedding at all?\" I asked. \n\n\"No, I didn't, but I'm at peace\
  \ now. I have two healthy children and my life is full.\" A tear rolled down his\
  \ cheek. \"For me, telling my story for the first time to you is a good feeling.\"\
  \n\nI smiled. The sparkle returned to his eye. We looked up at the starry sky as\
  \ the parade passed."
