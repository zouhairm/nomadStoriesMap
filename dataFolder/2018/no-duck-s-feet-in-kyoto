Text: "I don\u2019t know what her first words to us were - no matter how hard I try,\
  \ I still need subtitles to understand Japanese - but she quickly followed them\
  \ up with a quick snap of English. \n\u201CNo, not like that!\u201D\nMy friend,\
  \ Julianne, and I exchanged glances. I wondered if I looked as startled as she seemed\
  \ to be. Then I looked back at the little Japanese woman hobbling over to us, stick\
  \ in hand and fury in her eyes. \n\nI\u2019d read an article about the older generation\
  \ in Kyoto just the day before. Someone had left a newspaper on the hostel table\
  \ and I\u2019d had a flick through while Julianne used her superior Japanese skills\
  \ to organise our stay in a shukubo - or temple lodging - for later in the week.\
  \ In the article, the writer explained that he had lived in Kyoto for many years\
  \ and had come to love the fact that locals (particularly older women) were happy\
  \ to tell a stranger off if it meant that they could be molded into the Kyoto ideal.\
  \ I\u2019d found the article interesting, but hadn\u2019t thought I\u2019d be experiencing\
  \ it first hand only a day later. \n\nFrozen in place, we watched the woman approaching\
  \ us, only a few steps away from a tea house where we\u2019d enjoyed a traditional\
  \ Japanese tea ceremony. I could still taste the froth of matcha on my tongue. I\
  \ hadn\u2019t expected to like it but the earthy freshness had felt more natural\
  \ to me than any other hot drink I\u2019d tried. Julianne, a typically British tea\
  \ drinker, had been less impressed. If I could make myself turn away from the old\
  \ woman, bearing down on us with her stick in hand, we would be able to hide in\
  \ the tea house gardens and the serenity of the koi pond. But the woman soon reached\
  \ us, face pink in the cold. \n\nShe was short, close to a head smaller than my\
  \ 5\u2019 3\u201D, but she may as well have been as tall as the buildings that towered\
  \ around us. She jutted her jaw towards our outfits. I think I stayed frozen - I\
  \ hope I stayed frozen - but internally I was cowering in my rented kimono, feeling\
  \ like I\u2019d been caught crossing some cultural taboo. We\u2019d borrowed her\
  \ culture for a day, monetising Japanese tradition, thieves and-\n\u201CWe do not\
  \ walk like ducks feet!\u201D she snapped, whacking the ground near our rented geta\
  \ shoes with her stick. \u201CWhy do you all walk wrong? Feet must not turn out.\
  \ No!\u201D\nShe berated us, forcing us to walk for her until she was satisfied\
  \ that the \u201Cduck\u2019s feet\u201D were gone. When we finally hurried away,\
  \ her gaze burning the backs of our patterned obis, our protesting feet were perfectly\
  \ Kyoto."
