Text: "It was a bone-chilling winter evening in Kohima, the capital of Nagaland. Known\
  \ for violent conflicts, exotic culture, and a paradise for those who seek the unknown.\
  \ My thirst for visiting this city was fuelled by Ian Douglas Wright's \"Globe Trekker\"\
  , Bertil Lintner\u2019s book \"Great Game East\", and Rajeev Bhattacharya\u2019\
  s book \"Rendezvous with Rebels\". The next morning I wanted to leave for Manipur\
  \ to visit the INA museum in Moirang, an extremely significant place in India's\
  \ struggle for freedom. I changed into my light clothes after a full day of exploration\
  \ and went to the desk clerk at the Nagaland State Transport's bus station. I told\
  \ him that I had a few questions for him and he cooperated, after which a brief\
  \ conversation with multiple revelations followed. \n\n\u201CCan you tell me the\
  \ easiest way to get to Imphal? I would like to directly enter Manipur directly\
  \ instead of going back to Guwahati.\u201D I enquired.\n\nThe clerk nodded his head\
  \ and said, \u201CYea, sure. The bus for Imphal leaves at 6:30. When do you want\
  \ to go?\u201D \n \nI was extremely relieved to hear about the bus. I replied, \u201C\
  Oh! That\u2019s great. I would like to take the bus tomorrow. Should I come here\
  \ to get the ticket first or will I get the ticket on the bus?\u201D\n\n\u201CTomorrow?\
  \ You won\u2019t find any transport to anywhere tomorrow. Don\u2019t you know that?\u201D\
  \ said the clerk.\n\nAll hell broke loose inside of me and I was completely dumbfounded.\
  \ I asked, \u201CWhy? What\u2019s wrong with tomorrow?\u201D\n\n\u201CBrother, tomorrow's\
  \ Republic day. You need to leave the city by 9 P.M. tonight. The curfew is going\
  \ to start from 7 in the evening and it\u2019s going to last the entire day tomorrow.\
  \ That\u2019s what happens here on national holidays. Hundreds of people like you\
  \ get stuck here every year. Take a taxi and get out of Kohima tonight.\u201D\n\n\
  Shocked, I went straight back to the guest house and brainstormed to figure my way\
  \ out. I booked tickets from Dimapur to Guwahati and then to Silchar. I left the\
  \ guest house on the 25th of January at 8:30 in the evening and went straight to\
  \ the yellow cab stand. I soon realized that I was just in time for the last taxi\
  \ for Dimapur. I reached Dimapur at 11:30 P.M and took the train to Guwahati. I\
  \ reached Guwahati the next morning and I then boarded the train to Silchar at midnight.\
  \ I reached Silchar the next day. Then made an 8-hour road journey and finally checked\
  \ in to my hotel in Aizawl at 9 P.M. After being on the road for 50 hours I was\
  \ famished. I was saved by the onsite restaurant's Pork curry and steamed rice."
