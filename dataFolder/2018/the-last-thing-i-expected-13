Text: "I met Chelsea on my flight to Buenos Aires. We were both in South America for\
  \ the first time.\n \n\u201CWhere you off to?\u201D she asked.\n\u201CFlores\u201D\
  \ I replied.\n\u201CWhat are you doing in such a dangerous area\u201D she asked.\n\
  \u201CI wanted to be reminded of home\u2026 just kidding, \nI\u2019d like an authentic\
  \ experience of Argentina\u201D I reply. \n\u201CEver heard of too much authenticity!\u201D\
  \ she exclaims.\n\nI frown at her response but see how much she fidgets \u2013 a\
  \ clear sign of nervousness \u2013 I realize that maybe she does care so we decide\
  \ to exchange numbers. I call a taxi and head to Ciudadela. Upon arriving to Ciudadela,\
  \ I decide to walk to Flores to fully experience Argentina. Or at least that\u2019\
  s the lie I tell myself to cover up my insatiable curiosity to try their \u201C\
  bife de Costilla\u201D a T-bone steak and their world-renowned wineries.\n\nOn route\
  \ to a restaurant, a strange man meets eyes with me. There\u2019s something comforting\
  \ yet cold about him. He stands on the corner a lot like the gangsters where I come\
  \ from. He smiles less than them, but his less dangerous. Well that\u2019s the personality\
  \ I\u2019ve created for him and we all do this in that 5 seconds we have to analyze\
  \ someone approaching us. Stereotypes are realer to us, than whatever poor people\u2019\
  s personalities are. It\u2019s a consequence of class. \n\nI stare back as living\
  \ in South Africa\u2019s murder capital has prepared me to defend my life and to\
  \ defend it well. He plays the game with me but with the emotion of a robot. It\u2019\
  s almost as if he in a permanent state of emotionless emotion.  His face looks as\
  \ if it\u2019s been creased by time and sun, and his hair was fully-bleached blonde.\
  \ \nIn a moment of insane perturbation, I change direction and approach him. \n\n\
  He says \u201Chey Negro de mierda\u201D which is a racial slur. \nI replied, \u201C\
  entiendo idiota\u201D. (I understand that idiot)\n\nWe both burst into laughter.\
  \ I begin to learn that his family from Africa too and we go for drinks, he takes\
  \ me to the Faena Hotel as their wine collection is \u201Camazing\u201D. We drink\
  \ and debate political and football views, delving into the darkest parts of our\
  \ masculinity. The night has almost been going too well, the pessimist in me arises\
  \ but I drown it with flammable liquid.  \n\nHe offers to take me home, I accept\
  \ as I have no idea how public transport works at night. \nOn our way home, a car\
  \ stands dead still ahead of us. Two people get out of the car: I reach for his\
  \ gun in the car but he grabs it and points it at me.\n\nChelsea walks out of the\
  \ car and I laugh and realize \u2013 Kyle, you\u2019ve been set up."
