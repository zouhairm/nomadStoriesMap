Text: "The ground shakes with nervous anticipation from the crowd, roars of excitement\
  \ rolling over them like ocean waves. A succession of horse riders gallop into view\
  \ at the far end of the crowd, slowing for no one, and charging straight into the\
  \ center. The adrenaline is so prevalent and widespread that I can practically taste\
  \ it, the music so loud that I can feel it pounding in my chest. The horses all\
  \ begin to rear up onto their hind legs and nearly a dozen people charge underneath\
  \ their bodies, lifting them up and whooping with glee. The cheering in the air\
  \ is electric and the joy around me is palpable as the crowd breaks into song. This\
  \ is a Menorcan Fiesta.\nThe paradise island of Menorca is home to less than 100,000\
  \ locals, making it the third largest of the Balearic Islands. I was lucky enough\
  \ to have a friend who had grown up on the island and upon arriving, was shown the\
  \ ins and outs of the island - both tourist sites and local spots. We spent quite\
  \ some time at Cala Mitjana, a small beach with virtually no tourists and crystal\
  \ clear waters, where the islanders are free to do whatever they\u2019d like. It\u2019\
  s very commonplace to see the locals topless or sometimes fully unclothed at the\
  \ beaches; nudity isn\u2019t the novelty here that it is elsewhere.\nEvery summer\
  \ the entire island of Menorca throws fiestas - not some contrived tourist event,\
  \ but a series of celebrations that the islanders throw themselves and enjoy probably\
  \ more than your average tourist. Each town hosts a fiesta over different weekends,\
  \ spanning the party out across the summer. \nI wasn\u2019t sure what I was getting\
  \ myself into when I went with my friend to her town\u2019s local fiesta. She told\
  \ me it was a party and that I had to see it for myself to do it justice; I assumed\
  \ it would be the usual music and dancing, maybe somebody would do something wild\
  \ for a laugh. I was floored when almost immediately after arriving there were horses\
  \ galloping through the crowd, the sea of people parting so naturally it looked\
  \ choreographed. There was no fear of safety amongst the crowd, really no concern\
  \ for anything at all, as the horses charged toward us, rearing up above your head\
  \ like it was nothing at all. The music is an anthem of joy and freedom all around\
  \ you, and it doesn\u2019t take long for the crowd to sing along, dancing and climbing\
  \ up on each other like it was the end of the world. I\u2019ve seen nothing like\
  \ it, and I don\u2019t know if I ever will again. Menorca is a land of unexpected\
  \ dreams."
