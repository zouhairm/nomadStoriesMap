Text: "A dozen dusty chickens scuttled ahead of us in the dirt, parting like bobbing,\
  \ feather-capped waves on the Red Sea, if you believe in that sort of miracle. It\
  \ was a fitting introduction to San Simon, a local deity we were seeking out in\
  \ a small Guatemalan market town in the mountains. Looking up at the nearby volcanoes,\
  \ I understood the need for a miracle-maker, even one who was known for womanising,\
  \ drinking and smoking.\n\nThe origins of San Simon are mixed, at best. Was the\
  \ original Saint Simon an 18th century Catholic priest, known as much for his wicked\
  \ ways as for his good deeds?  Or was he a boozy itinerant Mayan shaman who lived\
  \ 500 years ago, performing acts of charity as he travelled the highlands? Most\
  \ likely he's a fusion of the two, a merging of myth, culture and superstition that\
  \ Central America easily embraces.  \n\nWe'd travelled by chicken bus that morning\
  \ from Quetzaltenango to Zunil after hearing about the hard-living, cross-cultural\
  \ saint, who changed his address regularly. Finding him was simply a matter of asking\
  \ around and in barely ten minutes we were crossing a roughly fenced area that enclosed\
  \ rustic buildings, animal pens and vegetable beds. Chickens and pigs roamed the\
  \ dusty yard along with small children and a couple of skinny dogs. San Simon held\
  \ court in a small, unremarkable central building.\n \nWe entered at the rear of\
  \ a large, dimly-lit room with rows of chairs facing a bright and blazing spectacle.\
  \ Thirty or so candles in jars sat on a long bench, silhouetted by silver-framed\
  \ pictures of San Simon. Festive paper flowers decorated the walls and floor around\
  \ a figure in a black suit, gloves and cowboy hat. His orange shirt and tie blared\
  \ above the candlelight. San Simon - part mannequin, part god - sat immobile, cigarette\
  \ dangling over his chin, as three men kneeled before him in supplication.  \n\n\
  The flickering light, the bright colours, the Roy Orbison outfit and the men muttering\
  \ in low voices - it all felt surreal.  One of the kneeling men stood and poured\
  \ a liquid, probably aguadiente, the local sugarcane-based firewater, into San Simon's\
  \ \"mouth\".  Almost immediately a stream of liquid splashed loudly into a bowl\
  \ under the chair, at discord with the sound of muted prayers. From the shadows\
  \ a woman darted forward and placed a bowl of tamales in his lap, before mouthing\
  \ her own appeal, hands clasped firmly together and eyes cast downward.  Surreal\
  \ or not, the believers of San Simon were waiting for their own miracles."
