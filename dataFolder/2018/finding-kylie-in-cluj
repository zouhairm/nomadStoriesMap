Text: "I\u2019ll admit it, I was a little not-sober. I had arrived late last night.\
  \ 3AM, fog rolling away from the train station, a half-asleep ticket inspector mumbling\
  \ something in a language that sounded almost Italian, but almost Slavic. The blinking\
  \ Wi-Fi signal had lasted long enough to tell me there would be at least another\
  \ twelve hours to go till the next stop. \n\nI saw the name smudged on the map in\
  \ my used travel guide. It didn\u2019t sound like a city. Cluj-Napoca. My ungraceful\
  \ Australian tongue silently sounding the words out inside my mouth. Cluj-Napoca.\n\
  \nMy heart fluttered, without thinking I grabbed my backpack and held out my ticket.\
  \ I stepped out into the thick night, smelled the foreign breeze, and was suddenly\
  \ standing in the middle of Transylvania. Coming from Budapest I felt like Johnathan\
  \ Harker - which made my skin crawl.\n\nBeing a gay backpacker in a nebulous Eastern\
  \ European country I immediately flicked to the LGBT section of my book, only to\
  \ find there wasn\u2019t one for Romania. Not quite encouraging.\n\nLocal knowledge\
  \ in this instance is an invaluable resource. And by local knowledge I mean nefarious\
  \ dating apps. Sleeping through most of the next day I awoke to several messages.\
  \ Hidden amongst the broken English and blurred selfies was a tantalising nugget\
  \ of information: There was a secret gay club hidden beneath the streets of the\
  \ city.\n\nI was going to find it.\n\nArmed a few too many shots of tuica, I set\
  \ out.\n\nI wandered past the squished colourful houses and closed shop fronts.\
  \ Down cobblestoned streets which grew narrower and narrower. Did anyone know where\
  \ I was? Was this a good idea? The tuica whispered reassuringly and I continued.\n\
  \nI came to a doorway shrouded in shadow. A man stepped out and looked me up and\
  \ down. \n\n\u201CMantie!\u201D\n\nHe held out his hands and gestured to my jacket.\
  \ I slowly pulled it off and handed it to him. He nodded and let me go inside.\n\
  \nThe hallway curved and dived underground. I wobbled down steps that seemed to\
  \ only get steeper. I felt instinctively for my phone.  I had no reception anyway.\n\
  \nThere was an explosion of light and I realised a door had been opened. I stepped\
  \ out into a massive cavern, blinking pink and blue and gold. And to my surprise\
  \ found a familiar Australian voice crooning back at me. Kylie Minogue was tearing\
  \ up the dancefloor in Romania.\n\nYoung, gay Romanians were spinning around under\
  \ a mirrorball, laughing and drinking and dancing. The place was packed. Grinning,\
  \ I shook off my fears and joined them."
