Text: "In Japan, and parts of Asia, tofu making is considered an art.  Ideally, tofu\
  \ is made every morning in small shops around Japan.  Kyoto is to tofu what New\
  \ York is to pizza, and Chicago to hot dogs.  The Kyoto variety has been perfected\
  \ over centuries by Buddhist monks, as well as in imperial kitchens and small, artisan\
  \ shops like Morika.  It is the gold standard, the best in Japan, and therefore,\
  \ the world.\n \nThe thing that turns tonyu, or soy milk, into tofu is called nigari.\
  \ Crystals of magnesium chloride act as a coagulant, much as rennin makes cheese\
  \ curds out of cow's milk. The familiar, firm, square-cut variety is called momen-dofu,\
  \ meaning \"cotton tofu,\" as it was traditionally pressed over a porous cloth.\
  \ Kinugoshi-dofu means \"silken tofu,\" and while silk isn't actually used to prepare\
  \ it, the name makes sense: \"It is a wet, jiggly tofu with the silken creaminess\
  \ of a custard\u2014the best a soybean can be.\" (from Adam Sachs)\n \nSo, why Kyoto?\
  \  Much like Olympia beer in Tumwater, Washington, they say its the water in Kyoto.\
  \  Kyoto has good quality water thanks to hundreds of underground springs.  It is\
  \ a soft water, and good for making tofu. Secondly, Kyoto grows high quality soy\
  \ beans.  The third, and perhaps most important reason, are the many temples around\
  \ Kyoto.  The priests in these temples are against killing animals.\n\nEach tofu\
  \ shop has a long history and tradition.  Competition is fierce. Though the birthplace\
  \ of tofu was in China, it spread to other countries.  Some of the famous shops\
  \ in Kyoto:\n \nSeveral arguments exist over when the best time to eat tofu might\
  \ be.  Diehards will say anytime.  Purists will say only at lunch time.  I say,\
  \ whenever you take an expensive taxi ride from your hotel in Kyoto, to the outskirts\
  \ of town where Morika Tofu is made.  It might only be once in a lifetime.  In my\
  \ case, it was most likely the world's most expensive tofu.\n\nSo, it was about\
  \ a $60 ride to Morika, and then back to our drop off point. The tofu was about\
  \ $5 each. So $70 for 2 blocks of tofu, and one small piece of yaki tofu. But worth\
  \ every penny since we enjoyed our banter with the driver. In fact, we gave our\
  \ driver one of the tofu blocks.  He gave Sheri his prayer beads as a token of his\
  \ appreciation.  He kept bowing, and even made me speak to his wife on his cell\
  \ phone.   We felt very honored. When we ate the tofu, it simply melted in our mouth."
