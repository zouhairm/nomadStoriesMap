Text: "\u201CSalud,\u201D the shaman said and I downed the contents of my plastic\
  \ cup, the brew sliding down my throat and my nose crinkling at the strange aroma.\
  \ In the Sacred Valley of Peru, I was embarking on an adventure like no other \u2013\
  \ an exploration of the mind.\n\nAn Amazonian vine known for its hallucinogenic\
  \ properties and commonly misconstrued as a drug, ayahuasca is a natural medicine\
  \ known to relieve anxiety, addiction and depression. It has also become a recent\
  \ global trend in the holistic community with many partaking in casual shamanism.\
  \ An advocate for unusual adventures, I was intrigued to know more. \n\nIn a tent\
  \ surrounded by nine other participants, a nurse, doctor and coordinator, I was\
  \ involved in the real deal: The Etnikas Retreat\u2019s sacred ceremony. The shaman,\
  \ a mystical woman, lit a candle in the center of the tent and began chanting. \n\
  \nInstantly, I felt the brew ripple through my body, starved from anything that\
  \ could dilute the medicine. For two weeks leading up to the retreat, I had been\
  \ on a strict shamanic diet: no drugs, dairy, meat, sugar, salt or processed foods.\
  \ A difficult feat for a carnivore and coffee addict, I had lived off rice, water\
  \ and willpower.\n\nThe candle hissed. Everything went black. I closed my eyes and\
  \ opened them to a kaleidoscope of colors merging into a million stars. They danced\
  \ as I flew past. The chanting was lulled by the distinct sound of vomiting. I cradled\
  \ my plastic bucket but nothing happened. \n\n\u201CYou must make a throw up,\u201D\
  \ the nurse said in her best English, holding a water bottle to my lips.\n\n\u201C\
  It\u2019s so strong.\u201D I heard myself murmur, distracted by the prolific imagery\
  \ playing across my conscience. There was no pulling out of the experience now.\
  \ \n \nAfter offering the bucket a small portion of my demons, I was permitted rest\
  \ in my sleeping bag to ride the roller coaster of my subconscious: a gentle, euphoric\
  \ trip.\n\nIn the early hours of the morning, the angelic staff escorted us to our\
  \ respective rooms, carefully tucking us into bed before retiring to sleep. Following\
  \ a hearty breakfast, we then gathered in the common room beneath stunning mountain\
  \ vistas to discuss our experiences with the shaman.\n\nOver a year later, I am\
  \ still a committed pescatarian and derive little pleasure from consuming artificial\
  \ produce. To my complete shock, ayahuasca improved my diet and overall disposition.\n\
  \nI paid over $500 to throw up in a tent with strangers and the last thing I expected\
  \ was for it to be so enlightening."
