Text: "The ice cream man and various tunes such as pop goes the weasel are as much\
  \ a part of my American childhood as anything I can recall. Do you remember push\
  \ pops or tweety bird shaped treats with gumball eyes? Imagine my surprise and delight\
  \ when in the middle of a month in Taiwan I heard a similar tune being broadcast\
  \ from a passing vehicle. Not only that, but it seemed to bring the building to\
  \ life. From inside the apartment I could hear people rushing about and hurrying\
  \ down stairs. I was immediately transported home as well as back in time. I felt\
  \ my expectation deflate, my host was out and I didn't have the key. The Taiwanese\
  \ ice cream experience would have to wait.\nWhen Samantha arrived home I inquired\
  \ about the musical truck almost immediately. She grinned almost laughingly and\
  \ told me next time they came she would be sure to take me downstairs. A few days\
  \ later the magical moment arrived. I was confused as Samantha gathered some bags\
  \ before heading hurriedly down the stairs. As we arrived at ground level, I was\
  \ astounded to find most of the residents of this multi floor building patiently\
  \ waiting in line. Not to acquire a treat, but instead to sort garbage into buckets\
  \ in the back of the vehicle. From shock to amusement I felt a full smile flood\
  \ my face, I was simultaneously surprised and impressed. In Taiwan I had experienced\
  \ a phenomenon...sparkling public hygiene a.k.a. no trash in the streets and yet\
  \ it was truly a difficult place to find a public trash receptacle. Nearly as much\
  \ as my own nostalgic memories, I savor moments where I\u2019m able to view unique\
  \ day to day elements that make up a larger picture of society. These little gems\
  \ of cultural reality can catch you by surprise anywhere you go and sometimes the\
  \ misinterpretations can be a striking reminder that we are all products of our\
  \ environment. One can choose to be bothered, to expand one's view or simply be\
  \ left standing with the question, trash or treat?"
