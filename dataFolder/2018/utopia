Text: "In hippy, history-soaked, sun-drenched Granada, where pigs practically hang\
  \ from the sky as a show of culture, a sign of the Crusades, Moors, convivencia\
  \ and what was once referred to as the ornament of the world, life is about being\
  \ free. Where Muslims, Jews and Christians famously lived, loved and learnt about\
  \ philosophy and life in a utopian melting pot for 800 years. Above this history,\
  \ in foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains sits the magnificent Alhambra mosque;\
  \ the ultimate expression of the all-encompassing Divine. Each minute, hand-carved\
  \ tile pays homage to the oneness of the universe, and even with my bitter broken\
  \ heart it was impossible to ignore its ancient secrets and hidden realms of love.\n\
  \ \nOpposite this architectural glory lies the heritage town of Albaycin. Today,\
  \ it\u2019s a modern embodiment of freedom with art and music scattered across a\
  \ maze of cobbled white alleys taken over by cats reproducing at a shocking rate\
  \ to the sound of distant flamenco singers learning their craft. Here, the August\
  \ heat demanded I forget my freshly broken heart with cold local cervesa, tapas\
  \ and street music from noon \u2018til dawn. And it was here I learnt my most radical\
  \ lesson in love. His name? Miguel. His weapon? The ukulele. Miguel was one part\
  \ of a local folk band that played simple melodies each night in the plaza of Albaycin.\
  \ His honey eyes, dark skin and loopy lyrics about the taste of utopia, cinnamon\
  \ and women oozed warm, sensual life. After a night of dancing, sat high in the\
  \ hills overlooking the magical Alhambra, the sun rose to gentle twang of Miguel\u2019\
  s ukulele. The conversation turned to philosophy:\n \n\"Utopia est\xE1 aqui\" Miguel\
  \ cooed, looking at me, doe-eyed and utterly convinced. \n \n\"Utopia is here. In\
  \ this life\", friends translated. Slowly he fed me honey-soaked bread and right\
  \ there I decided to abandon my raw heart and any notion of everlasting love. I\
  \ wanted to taste Miguel\u2019s idea of utopia.\n \nHours after intense unbridled\
  \ passion, I woke up next to modern utopia in ruffled sheets. Miguel opened his\
  \ laptop beside me.\n \n \"Open relaci\xF3n. Muy complicado\u201D he wrote in GoogleTranslate.\
  \ Open relationship. The opposite of monogamy. The ultimate expression of freedom.\
  \ My heart gawked.\n \nAs the bakery shutters clacked open and whistling street\
  \ cleaners swept away last night\u2019s sins, I commenced my walk of shame home\
  \ having lived something new; an idea of acceptance, being open, love, and a solid\
  \ regret I hadn\u2019t learnt Spanish before coming here."
