Text: "Not long ago, in one of those tumultuous times of crazy research and big personal\
  \ evolution, I had a dream (just a dream?), while at sleep. I saw a beautiful huge\
  \ templar vessel, in full sail, with typical red crosses and a few other details:\
  \ the inner parts of the ship, especially the wooden ones, and many people inside.\
  \ Who were they? Where were they going go? Was this vessel designed for war or what?\
  \ I could hear in my head the whisper of the name of a city placed in the south-east\
  \ of Italy, the \"heel\" or Puglia, Apulia for the Romans. A city I have never visited\
  \ before. At least, not in this lifetime. Barletta.\n\nFrame after frame they appeared\
  \ in the screen of my mind other details of this movie: the huge harbour in an ordinary\
  \ busy day with many hard-working and shouting people. A typical award-winning hystorical\
  \ film-setting! All of a sudden I saw a familiar standing figure, someone met in\
  \ this lifetime many years ago and with whom I had had a very strong connection\
  \ but with difficulties of any kind: no Internet, no mobile phones, no low-cost\
  \ flights made a beautiful love story even more complicated with many lessons to\
  \ learn. But in the midst of the emotional storm, I knew, inside of me, that one\
  \ day the very strong connection felt for someone living too far away from me could\
  \ be explained and the dots connected at last. \n\nBack to our movie...other details\
  \ came to the vision: a shore in the dark night, a trial, and at the end both of\
  \ us reconciled - at present times - on a beach. What happened in that past time\
  \ that needed reconciliation? Most likely we were both living in another century\
  \ (if you believe in past lives) and somehow working in those ships carrying pilgrims\
  \ from Italy and other parts of Europe during the middle age and later times through\
  \ some routes of the via Francigena towards the Holy Land. Something I researched\
  \ about and reconstruct only after the dream, since I was completely unaware of\
  \ this piece of history! \n\nI don't know exactly what happened, most likely something\
  \ very serious, but one thing is sure: one year after this vision I was unexpectedly\
  \ invited in this town. I asked to be taken to the \"old\" harbour, a bit far away\
  \ from the new one. I took all the time to watch the whole picture and recognized\
  \ the setting. \n\nAnd now the distorted past, the big pain of this lifetime seems\
  \ to have been healed once and for all, giving space to a beautiful, lasting and\
  \ strong friendship. \n\nMisteriously. Magically. Unexpectedly."
