Text: "\u201CAre you waiting for the flight to Delhi?\u201D \n\u201CYou mean the one\
  \ that just left?\u201D he asked, a little unsure about my question. \nI looked\
  \ at the runway and back again at the stranger in front of me in utter disbelief.\
  \ After a moment of stunned silence I heard myself yelling right into his face,\
  \ \u201CBut how can it leave?\u201D \nImages of the last 18 hours whizzed by, giving\
  \ me goose bumps, as I ran wildly across the concourse, looking for the transit\
  \ desk. \n\nHolding the side of my stomach and panting for breath, I argued, \u201C\
  But I am well before time!\u201D \n\u201CMoscow time?\u201D asked the old lady behind\
  \ the counter, without the slightest change of expression. \n\u201CWhat!\u201D I\
  \ muttered under my breath, looking at the local time on the wall-clock in front\
  \ of me. \n\nSlumped into the nearest chair, I felt exhausted yet surprisingly calm.\
  \ Proud of having made it so far. In life. A smile washed over my face, drawing\
  \ strange glances from those around me. They\u2019d just witnessed my melodramatic\
  \ entry followed by a near breakdown. Anxious was perhaps what they expected next.\
  \ \nSo did I. \nBut far from being sorry, I felt accomplished.\nMemories of the\
  \ 12 year old girl - sitting on the porch of her house, gazing at the star lit sky\
  \ and the occasional airplane fly by; came flooding back. Wondering how it\u2019\
  d feel to be in one. Wanting to grow wings of her own.\nNot knowing for years that\
  \ every act of defiance \u2013 from choosing books over sharpening her culinary\
  \ skills to refusing to get betrothed at 22 years of age was doing just that. Shattering\
  \ one glass ceiling after another.\nNot in her wildest dreams had she imagined that\
  \ one day at the age of 28, she\u2019d lose her way multiple times in three different\
  \ countries. A bus in Vienna, a train in Prague and a flight in Moscow. All within\
  \ a few hours and one completely unrelated to the other. That she\u2019d fight hunger,\
  \ bone-chilling cold and sleep in one country, a drunk mugger in the dead of the\
  \ night and her worst fears all through. \nThat she\u2019ll finally grow her wings\
  \ far away from everything known and familiar. That while the sun in Moscow would\
  \ only warm her bones, it will be her newfound sense of freedom that would warm\
  \ her being.\n\nI parted from these thoughts as someone called out my name.\n\u201C\
  We\u2019re putting you on the next flight to Delhi. My manager has arranged it for\
  \ free,\u201D she said with a wry smile on her face. \nMine lit up as brightly as\
  \ my new found spirit. \nFinally my ordeal was over. I\u2019d found something more\
  \ precious than just my way back home."
