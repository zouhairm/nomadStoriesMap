Text: "As I opened the old wooden door of our room at 6:15 A.M., a sudden gush of\
  \ early winter morning wind numbed my face. The biting cold chilled my fingers and\
  \ crept inside my clothes. With each breath, more puffs of white vapors rose. We\
  \ loaded in the vehicles as all were excited for the expedition 'A journey to meet\
  \ the Stranger'.\nIt was a December holiday time in Kanha Kisli National Park, Madhya\
  \ Pradesh. My maternal aunts with their families had came to visit us. And a sudden\
  \ plan made our vacations a memorable one. We reached there in the evening and I\
  \ was mesmerized with the view of the open sky with tons of shining stars. I thought\
  \ the stars had come down on ground but those were the glittering eyes of the deers\
  \ in the dark along the forest boundary.\nThe park is divided in 4 zones- Kanha,\
  \ Kisli, Mukki and Sarhi. We hit the Kanha gate at 6:30 A.M in two vehicles a forest\
  \ jeep and a car. My parents, aunts, guide and our driver sat in the car and others\
  \ were in the jeep. \nAs we entered, I could feel the fresh morning breeze. The\
  \ beauty of the forest robbed of my senses. On either sides of the roads were the\
  \ tall Bamboo and Sal trees with an undergrowth of wild grasses and thorny bushes.\
  \ Then the large meadows of grasslands came where one could easily spot the Sambar\
  \ Deers. The Monkeys, Langoors, Deers and different birds were the common animals\
  \ to spot. But all were interested in watching the Tiger only.\nYou have to be really\
  \ lucky to watch the tiger, the guide said. The temperature started rising and our\
  \ safari was coming to an end. \nDisheartened we were marching towards the gate\
  \ but the car which just passed the water channel broke down. We stopped our jeep\
  \ before crossing the channel. The male members of the car got down and were fixing\
  \ it.\nBored, I looked at them and then down. With the blink of my eye, I realized\
  \ that I have seen some orange, black, white strips against the green landscape.\
  \ I looked up and saw the mighty alpha beast. Silent as a ghost, walking with ripples\
  \ in its muscles and here arrives 'The Royal Bengal Tiger' with glowing amber eyes.\n\
  Confused, stunned and spellbound at the same time we shouted. Hurriedly they sat\
  \ in the car and the majestic animal crossed the path as calmly as if no one existed,\
  \ being the king of the jungle. We almost skipped our heart beat.\nThe grace, power,\
  \ shine and the grandeur that the jungle tiger carries is so overwhelming that it\
  \ is difficult to forget such a least expected and unusual encounter in my life."
