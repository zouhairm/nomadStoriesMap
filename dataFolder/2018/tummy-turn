Text: "He saw how lost and curious I looked, and so he walked in my direction. I had\
  \ gotten into that atrium for I was famished, but I ended up finding nourishments\
  \ that were not on the menu. One could listen to the majestic silence in that random\
  \ cubicle on the threshing floor of a Nepalese restaurant in Vienna. It was a chilly\
  \ day, but those men ignored the feeling of having cold extremities, for they were\
  \ greatly devoted to warming the world with philosophies of love.\n\nWhile the other\
  \ monks, in some sort of trance, were drawing sand mandalas on a vast board, I found\
  \ myself flying beyond the colors and I must hardly have hidden in my gaze what\
  \ I was experiencing inside. He spoke in a calm voice, nearly whispering. To be\
  \ able to listen to him, I had to empathically focus.\n\n-Do you have any questions?\n\
  \n-Too many.\n\n-You can start by putting one. \u2013 He told me while smiling.\n\
  \nI was in the last stage of a 35-day trip through ten countries of the Balkan route.\
  \ I certainly did not lack questions. I asked one and then another and then another.\
  \ Perhaps one day I might have the guts to transcribe everything I wrote down in\
  \ the travel log. We uttered about patience, about waiting. He told me about their\
  \ yearly voyages, about monasteries, Buddhism. Every year, they journey to five\
  \ distinct nations, in an art exchange, so they can aim their end of collecting\
  \ donations for the erection of a new monastery, where poor children can be schooled\
  \ for free.\n\nThe Tibetan monk gave me pieces of advice about life. We took a deep\
  \ breath. We talked about silence, mundane anxieties, and love.\n\n-What about love?\n\
  \n-I feel it\u2019s getting harder.\n\n-He laughed.\n\n-It\u2019s hard to wait.\
  \ Rejection is challenging. People are hard, not love. Love is not the voice of\
  \ the ego, it\u2019s the sublime silence of being. It doesn\u2019t need to raise\
  \ its voice, change its pitch. It\u2019s here, awaiting no rewards.  \n\n-Sometimes\
  \ tasting some chocolate would be nice.\n\n-He laughed once again, with a fondness\
  \ for my impatience.\n\n-Yes, it would. But gluttony is also a cry from ego. It\u2019\
  s just a transitory pleasure. But in the long run, do you know what it does?\n\n\
  -What?\n\n-It makes your tummy turn."
