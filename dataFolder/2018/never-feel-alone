Text: "I was on my way to Jodhpur. I'd planned this trip alone through the Rajasthan\
  \ since a long time, read a lot of travel blogs and forums to make my perfect tailor\
  \ made trip to India. No agencies, no tour opetor: just me and my backpack.\nI took\
  \ the train from Jaipur, 6 hours journey in 3-tier AC car, sleeper class. Essentially\
  \ it means that the car is divided up into rooms where there are berths of beds,\
  \ very little private space but not excessively crowded.\nOne of my aim of my trip\
  \ to India was to experience the reality of this country, fill my eyes of colours\
  \ and my soul of feelings, with all the beauty and all the rawness.\nIn India people\
  \ are incredibly courious: they stare at you all the time, they follow you and try\
  \ to approach you, especially if you are blonde and clearly westerner like me. This\
  \ could be uncomfortable, but I suggest to accept and embrace all their interest\
  \ in knowing your culture.\nDuring my journeys in train I used to read a book, rest\
  \ or looking out the window the landscape changing harmoniosly, but that day something\
  \ went different than usual: I was chilling in my seat thinking to my next stop:\
  \ the Blue city of Jodhpur. I noticed a little girl going back and forward the corridor\
  \ and glanced at me every time. I smiled at her and she smiled me back saing the\
  \ cutest \"hello\" I have ever heard in my life. \nShe sat besides me and started\
  \ to chat: her name is Puja, she is 9 years old, she attend the primary school in\
  \ a little village near Jaipur, she has two brothers and she wants to be a doctor\
  \ when she grows up. We kept talking for a while until she dediced to come back\
  \ to her parents'car. \nTen minutes later I saw the lovely face of Puja again. This\
  \ time she asked me (almost begging) to join her family and share the meal with\
  \ them. I felt so happy but at the same time embarassed because I knew a meal for\
  \ a normal family could be a big affort. But Puja insisted so much to honor her\
  \ family with my presence that I could not refuse.\nI joined Puja's family in their\
  \ car and they welcomed me with such a great happiness and love that it touched\
  \ my heart. I spent my time answering their questions about Italy, about my family\
  \ and my life. Puja drew with henna all my hands, I ate paneer served with chapatti,\
  \ rice, a gulab jam, everything delicious and obviously so spicy! \nThe time flew\
  \ thanks this humble and incredible family. I mentioned that I made my trip alone\
  \ but actually, in India, I've never felt alone."
