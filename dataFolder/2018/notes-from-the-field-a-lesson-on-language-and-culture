Text: "\"If you want to change the world, you should be an example yourself,\" he\
  \ said while we chatted after my observation of his electrical skills lab. I, the\
  \ on-looker, was content to sit in the corner and take my notes like a fly on the\
  \ wall - observing, but not participating. After all, that's what the monitoring\
  \ in monitoring and evaluation means, isn't it? \n\n\"Someone said if you don't\
  \ talk to a guest you are wrong.\" Was the statement he used to begin what would\
  \ become our conversation. Daniel was his name and as he sat across the room from\
  \ me plying away at an electrical wire and explaining his love for both science\
  \ and music, I couldn't help but reflect on the many differences and similarities\
  \ between us. \n\nDaniel wants to be a rapper, produce music and have his own record\
  \ label. My accent intrigued him and as I said I was from the United States of America,\
  \ he remarked that his brain had to process so fast for him to speak English to\
  \ me. \n\nAt that moment, I yearned to speak the Zulu or isiXhosa spoken to me,\
  \ before a person realized I wasn't from South Africa even though I looked the part.\
  \ \nLanguage and culture are deeply tied up in his rapper with a record label dreams\
  \ too. \"If you rap in English you're a sellout. But, rapping in Sotho limits my\
  \ target market.\" Target market that if you hadn't yet guessed is not just the\
  \ individuals in his Orange Farm township or even Johannesburg. \n\n\"You need capital\
  \ to do music,\" he said. Trapped in a world that wants him to be one thing, stresses\
  \ the importance of English and school - science. But what about his first love?\n\
  \n\"The nature of the consequence depends upon the nature of the decision made.\"\
  \ He was talking about his personal plans yet jolted me to attention with this statement.\
  \ \n\nI'm still conflicted about who I am to be coming into a country and context\
  \ not my own under the guise of working to \"improve\" or study anything. Still\
  \ trying to figure out where I think I have the right to engage and what international\
  \ development really means.\n\nI had to go conduct another interview. I thanked\
  \ Daniel for talking with me, to which he asked the most important question of all.\
  \ \n\n\"So, do you have tacos?\" in America that is. Daniel had never seen one before.\
  \ He wanted to know if my life in America looked like what he heard in all the songs\
  \ and rhymes he listened to. Leaving me to reflect on the notion, that how language\
  \ and culture spread, is just as important and interesting as the fact that they\
  \ spread too."
