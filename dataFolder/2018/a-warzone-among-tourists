Text: "Rumbling vibrations came from under as the train slowed and finally rolled\
  \ to a stop in the damp Louisiana humidity. I had been on the locomotive, off and\
  \ on, for over thirty hours. I was ready for a walk. Not so patiently- I was desperate\
  \ for fresh air-I made my way to the door and stumbled down the narrow steps leading\
  \ to freedom, food, and a place to smoke. No more layovers. No more stops. I had\
  \ made it.\n\nI pulled a cigarette from my pocket, then my phone, something that\
  \ didn't function well in the southern climate, and dialed for my friend, Jordan.\
  \ \n\n\"Hello? Where you at?\" he asked. He'd been waiting at the station since\
  \ noon.\n\n\"I just got off the train,\" I answered, pulling hard on the first cigarette\
  \ I'd smoked in hours, \"About to walk through the doors.\"\n\nAfter meeting up\
  \ with Jordan, he helped me carry my luggage to the closest tram, which dropped\
  \ us close to his apartment building. We didn't get to catch up, at least not right\
  \ away, for he had to go to work.\n\n\"Sorry, man,\" he said, brushing his hair,\
  \ \"I can show you around later. Take my bike, the beach cruiser, and go see the\
  \ quarter.\"\n\nThe French Quarter echoed with sounds of jazz music, drunk tourists,\
  \ and street performers, of which there was little they wouldn't do to entertain.\
  \ I wanted to savor that experience though, save some of the fresh excitement for\
  \ when Jordan got off to make some memories with him, so I peddled onward, away\
  \ from the quarter.\n\nI quickly found myself in the ninth ward, a neighborhood\
  \ devastated by Hurricane Katrina almost ten years prior. I knew the stories well,\
  \ remembered the news coverage of when it took place, but what I saw was unfathomable.\
  \ What I thought would be as magical in essence as the tourist-heavy Bourbon street,\
  \ or the art-influenced atmosphere of Jackson Square, instead resembled a war-zone.\
  \ It was as if the flood just happened. \n\nApartment buildings, devastated by flood\
  \ waters, still stood tall, but had been abandoned long before, their remaining\
  \ walls and foundations rotting away. Moss-covered houses, also abandoned, gave\
  \ local graffiti artists an almost endless supply of canvas'. My gut ached as I\
  \ witnessed the words, ones speaking of revolution, the pain of being used as a\
  \ tourist site, and countless other memories of loss. Almost a whole decade had\
  \ passed since the flood and it looked as if nothing had been restored, the residents\
  \ left to fend for themselves. I didn't stay long. I left not wanting to disrupt\
  \ the peace they had, if any."
