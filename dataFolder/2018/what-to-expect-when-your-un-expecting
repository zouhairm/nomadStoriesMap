Text: "She asked me to purchase incense as an offering when I had made it to the top\
  \ of Hoa Lu's Ancient Capital. Being a tourist for over a month now, and realizing\
  \ that because I look foreign, it is easy for locals to assume I don't know 1 dong\
  \ (VN money) from 1 dollar . . . I politely declined her offer. \n\nI continued\
  \ on in hopes that I would find a view more spectacular than the amount of weight\
  \ I had just lost in sweat climbing the mountain. Soon after I had arrived at the\
  \ sharp rocks, I noticed the gray-haired woman had followed me. Thinking she was\
  \ determined to get some money out of me, I dismissed her once again. But the next\
  \ time I turned around, she was on top of the highest boulder, grinning at me. \n\
  \nShe reached her hand out, a motion I took as her needing help to get down. Instead,\
  \ she pulled me close and beckoned me to climb on to the very same rock. She wanted\
  \ me to see the view from her perspective - the one she saw everyday for what I\
  \ figure has been a very long time. \n\nThe trek seemed less exhausting now and\
  \ age seemed relative. A climb that pushed me to break a river of sweat was nothing\
  \ more than a morning routine for her. And in that very moment, I realized that\
  \ more than anything, I wanted to grow in the way she had; To spend my life always\
  \ climbing up and hopefully, if I'm lucky, end up old, barefoot and smiling."
