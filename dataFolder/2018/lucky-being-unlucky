Text: "On a beautiful day in Granada, Nicaragua my friend and I've decided to rent\
  \ a car for a day to explore the beautiful Laguna de Apoyo, the capital Managua.\n\
  We've arrived around 11am at the view point of the Laguna and then decided to eat\
  \ our late breakfast in Managua.\nOn our way there a car repeatedly honked at us\
  \ so we drove to the side of the road.\nHesitatingly we stopped and as my friend\
  \ got out of the car she understood the three strangers worries as she saw our flat\
  \ tire. \nThey (2 guys and one women) offered their help and started easing our\
  \ flat tire of our car.\nWe were so surprised how nice they were helping two helpless\
  \ tourist girls with their car in the middle of Nicaragua.\nThe next seconds felt\
  \ like a blur. I just remember that there was this extreme heat,  their car speed\
  \ off, \na shock, everything gone.\n\nThey have robbed us. In the time of a few\
  \ seconds they took everything (cameras, credit cards, my cell phone ) of our front\
  \ seats and we stood there. \nTwo naive girls, with nothing but a flat car wheel\
  \ in their hands. \n\nThe next couple of days we had spend  so much time at the\
  \ police station, we even had the officer's WhatsApp numbers. \nWe've been struggling\
  \ with the car rental agency because of their car wheel (destroyed by a knife )\
  \ and we were so tired of 3 people runing our days in Nicaragua, bringing us nothing\
  \ but tears.\n\nThe last thing that I expected in this story was probably not the\
  \ robbery or the problems the agency caused instead of helping us. \n\nNo, it was\
  \ the couple from Maine who were at the police station and were building a homestay\
  \ at the Laguna. They've also been robbed by the same gang that day. \nThey lost\
  \ thousand of dollars and they were bulding something bigger for their lives. \n\
  The same night they offered to stay at their beautiful homestay for free. I've had\
  \ one of the most beautiful nights there and realized how lucky I am. \n\nAfter\
  \ all, the criminals just took our material belongings, not our lives.  \nAnd that\
  \ day I've learned how little my problems were. \nThe last thing I expected were\
  \ two strangers to help us and take us in like they knew we needed some parenting\
  \ care that night.\nSomeone who will tell you that everything will be fine because\
  \ those problems seem so big when you're alone in a different country where  communicating\
  \ can be  tough.\nThis story was a life lesson I will never forget.\nLife can kick\
  \ you in your stomach sometimes but its important to remember that it could always\
  \ be so much worse."
