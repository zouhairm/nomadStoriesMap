Text: "The taste of hot milk from the she-camel, the eye-catching way of dressing\
  \ and life of the Sahel, the brusquely redundant sandy soil, with dry wind of the\
  \ desert couldn't all spare my craving for travelling- to at least, quench my thirst\
  \ of curiosity in the Sahel. There I heard culture is a virtue, and that art is\
  \ the natural resource freely available to be tapped by anyone. \n\nThe bus is loaded\u2014\
  as we embark and journeying across Senegal: exactly from the garage Pikine in Dakar;\
  \ I effortlessly pulled the handle of the window wide opened, stacked with dirt,-I\
  \ begin missing the scent of Senegal as the journey begun. I sat on the middle-seat\
  \ of the bus, and happily squeezed the sweet Senegalese orange in my hand I have\
  \ been sucking like a woman. On the bus, I can see a bevy of ladies and a crowd\
  \ of gentlemen, sitting in front of me in numbers\u2014all chatting in many different\
  \ African languages. Before I could give a smile to any of the passengers, a nice-looking\
  \ lady, who, probably in her 20\u2019s, horizontally pushed the handle of her window,-\
  \ and spat so much uncivilized saliva from her African mouth. I looked at her and\
  \ my African lineage with great disrespect, my heart contested for answers. \n\n\
  \ I ignored her looks and inserted my earpiece into my ear and increased the volume\
  \ to its maximum:\_ listening to famous Gambian Jaliba Kuyateh, song title:\_ Mumeni-Bayo.\
  \ I did this not to hear anyone speaking. Though our bus is filled with cool traditional\
  \ music of the early 70\u2019s, my babyish ears and generation couldn\u2019t allow\
  \ me to even know the singer.\n\nAs we disembark from the bus to present our papers\
  \ and later rest up for dinner at a nearby restaurant in Mali; should I say, \_\
  the first place to be termed as a town, I can\u2019t recall neither pronounce the\
  \ name of this place, and don\u2019t ask me why\u2014 because the name is so obsolete\
  \ that it will reduce your life expectancy rate for hearing how it\u2019s called.\
  \ This is my first travel outside my country for the past 25 years\u2014 I must\
  \ write down the merits of my trip, and cautiously watch out for any prospect."
