Text: "\"It's like flying, not falling.\"\nI woke up too early in a hostel in the\
  \ Swiss Alps, but I wasn't going back to sleep. I heard other occupants just returning\
  \ from a long night out, and smiled.\nThat wasn't the kind of adventure I was seeking.\
  \ \nI dressed in all black; Nike clothes felt appropriate. Just do it.\n\"Going\
  \ to ski?\" asked a friendly bar worker downstairs.\n\"To skydive.\"\nHis surprise\
  \ was visible. I don't blame him. I don't look like the adventurous type. I'm small\
  \ and slender, my smile soft, and my voice quieter than average. I am the unexpected\
  \ adrenaline junkie. \"It's supposed to rain. I hope the weather holds out.\"\n\
  As I stepped outside, I nodded. \"Me, too.\"\nThe shuttle drove down the narrow\
  \ Interlaken street and stopped in front of me. I climbed in, and as I talked with\
  \ the other future skydivers, I felt comfort. Nearly all these women had connections\
  \ to my college town or hometown. The world felt small and safe for a few moments.\n\
  Then we arrived at the drop zone, where we were faced with the very real fact that\
  \ we were about to jump out of a plane, placing our trust in a stranger and a parachute.\
  \ I resolved to remember the name of my tandem instructor, since my life was in\
  \ his hands. It was Tom, and he skydives roughly five times a day.\nIt was blustery\
  \ and foggy, and our flight was delayed for nearly two hours, during which we first-timers\
  \ bonded, cried, and paced.\n Several times while we were standing in that cold\
  \ room, full of beer and skydiving gear, I wanted to back out. It would be warmer\
  \ on the ground. It would be cheaper. It would be safer.\n It would be less fun.\n\
  \ Half an hour later, I was using Tom's knee to hoist myself into the plane. The\
  \ sky was bright, pure blue interrupted by fluffy silver clouds. The plane was tiny\
  \ and packed with skydivers. I sat just in front of Tom as he strapped us together\
  \ and gave an aerial tour of the Alps.\n I couldn't hear most of what he said. What\
  \ I did hear, I don't recall - until he said the most important thing.\n \"The door\
  \ will open soon. Pull yourself up to the edge and I'll follow. \"\n My heart pounded\
  \ in my throat as I crawled forward and put my legs over the side of the plane.\
  \ I looked down and saw sparkling white mountains against the solid blue, and felt\
  \ icy wind and sheer disbelief about what I was doing.\n \"If you smile the whole\
  \ time, I'll take care of the rest.\"\n With that view, I smiled naturally. As I\
  \ sat on the edge, I remembered what I'd been told, \"It's like flying, not falling.\"\
  \ And it was."
