Text: "This is not an ordinary story. It\u2019s a treaty about how to believe in ourselves\
  \ and in our own dreams.\n I always admired the actor Antonio Banderas. But I\u2019\
  m not talking about a no sense admiration, not even done the \u201Ccrazy fan type\u201D\
  , it\u2019s not that... My point is a deep feeling that transcends the distance...\
  \ and the time. A kind of love so pure and so full of tenderness that I daresay\
  \ no one has ever seen before.\n And since I was a child, I wrote everything in\
  \ my diaries, so I could keep a real memory, until the very moment I wrote in january,\
  \ 2007: \u201COne day, mr. Banderas, I\u2019ll be before you. And on this day I,ll\
  \ say exactly the same words that Eva Per\xF3n said to Juan Per\xF3n the first time\
  \ she saw him. And she just said: Thank\u2019s for existing\u201D.\n Then one day\
  \ in 2012, I saw on the Antonio Banderas Fragrances\u2019s website the launch of\
  \ a Cultural Context with the following question: \u201CWhat is your secret of seduction?\u201D\
  . In that precisly moment I couldn\u2019t think about no one, not even though I\
  \ could have one! But the prize of the contest was a breakfast by his side in Chile!\
  \ And in that same morning I wrote the answer that would lead me to meet him, leaving\
  \ behind 500 people who competed with me: \u201CMy secret of seduction is to give\
  \ my essence to that special person, leaving it the powerfull mark of the singularity\
  \ of my being\u201D.\n And there I was! In Chile! Preparing myself to live the most\
  \ expected (and unexpected) day of my life. So the great day has come: And I saw\
  \ him... coming in my direction for the breakfast... so polished... so human...\
  \ and we spent the morning together. I had the oportunity to thank him for everything\
  \ I learned with him: my english, spanish (only watching his movies). He couldn\u2019\
  t believe he made so much difference in someone\u2019s life ever. And I was so dazzling\
  \ because God gave me the opportunity to show my gratitude!\n Finally, when he was\
  \ about to leave, I took his hand and after kissing it, I said: \u201CMr. Banderas,\
  \ there\u2019s something I\u2019ve been waiting almost 15 years to say to you. May\
  \ I?\u201D And he said: \u201CPlease\u201D. \u201CFor the first time Evita saw Per\xF3\
  n at the Luna Park Stadium, in 1944 ( I know you know this story very much, because\
  \ you sang the musical), she only had strength to say: Thans\u2019s for existing\u201D\
  . And I\u2019d like to make Evita\u2019s words my own words this morning: \u201C\
  Thank\u2019s for existing\u201D. He look at me, hugged me and left without saying\
  \ even a word... but that silence was the answer I needed to understand that I made\
  \ the difference in his life too."
