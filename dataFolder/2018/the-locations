Text: "After graduating from university in 2016, my boyfriend Brian and I returned\
  \ to his hometown of Bulawayo, Zimbabwe, for the first time since he had left ten\
  \ years previously. We caught a bus from Victoria Falls to Bulawayo, and he spent\
  \ the whole journey pressed against the window watching for signs of home. \nWhen\
  \ we arrived at Brian\u2019s childhood home in Nkhulumane 12, or \u2018The Locations\u2019\
  \ as it was known, he picked up a rock and knocked on the high, spiked gate which\
  \ surrounded the house. The woman I later came to know as mam\u2019dala, my aunty,\
  \ was standing under a wilting mango tree in the backyard eating clay. Brian had\
  \ neglected to tell her he was coming home, or that he was bringing a white girl\
  \ with him.\nFor three hot, crowded weeks, I lived with Brian\u2019s three-year-old\
  \ cousin, Itumelang, and her grandmother, mam\u2019dala. Mam\u2019dala was always\
  \ busy; mopping, sweeping, carrying buckets down to the water pump so she could\
  \ wash clothes in the tub. \nIn the mornings, Brian and I would sit on the concrete\
  \ slab outside the gate, drinking terrible instant coffee, and watching children\
  \ in their hundreds toddle to school in their neatly pressed uniforms. The passing\
  \ children called me khiwa, which means \u2018white person\u2019 in Ndebele. I told\
  \ them over and over again, \u201CIbizo lami ngu Ashleigh,\u201D but they still\
  \ giggled and screamed and whispered khiwa, khiwa, when I passed, over and over\
  \ again under their breath, like a joke for which they hadn\u2019t found a punchline.\
  \ \nWhen the electricity cut out, which it often did, mam\u2019dala was forced to\
  \ cook the family\u2019s solitary meal by candlelight. We ate only once a day, and\
  \ always polenta, which went by many names \u2013 pap, sadza, isitshwala \u2013\
  \ and always with chomolia, commonly known as African kale. It had been ten years\
  \ since Brian left, and hyperinflation meant Zimbabweans used a combination of American\
  \ notes and Zimbabwean bond coins to pay for wildly overpriced and poor-quality\
  \ foods. Food costs were similar to prices in Australia, but even skilled workers\
  \ in Bulawayo rarely made more than $400 a month. \nIt had been a long time since\
  \ the rains, and the chomolia was wilting before it had even risen out of the dust.\
  \ \nThe day I arrived home my parents were arguing because my mother had accidentally\
  \ bought unsalted cashews instead of salted. That night we ordered Indian food,\
  \ drank too much pink Moscato and went to bed while it was still light out. I wondered\
  \ if it was raining in The Locations yet. I wondered if mam\u2019dala was eating\
  \ clay."
