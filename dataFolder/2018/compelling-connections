Text: "\u2018Sonar Killa\u2019 \u2013 the golden fortress of Jaisalmer, it is one\
  \ of the very few \u201Cliving forts\u201D in the world, where people still reside\
  \ within the fort precincts; for which it has been designated as a World Heritage\
  \ Site. \n\nA bustling tourist destination that survives mostly on tourism \u2013\
  \ is also \u2018home\u2019 to its locals...\n\nIt was amazing to see people still\
  \ living in houses and streets that were built by their fore-fathers, hundreds of\
  \ years ago.\n\nWhile meandering through the fort town we saw the houses and havelis\
  \ now converted to hotels and home-stays; their owners trying to strike a balance\
  \ between preserving their heritage and making a living out of it; between living\
  \ their lives and also allowing others to be a part of it.\n\nWe stayed in one such\
  \ haveli. For us it was a hotel where we could get an experience of what it was\
  \ to live in an 800 years old living fort.\n\nAs night fell, the terraces of these\
  \ houses turn into cafes and hang-out places for tourists; the kitchens expand and\
  \ extend to serve; local delicacies often giving way to eclectic cuisines from far\
  \ away parts of the world. \n\nMorning arrived, with the bells of the neighbourhood\
  \ temple signalling the start of the daily rituals \u2013 accompanied by a prayer\
  \ being recited by an elderly voice in the house.There was a soft chatter of the\
  \ ladies of the house, drowned by the arguments of a young man in a slightly loud\
  \ and harsh tone; and in an instance, the same lad would speak ever so politely\
  \ and softly with us and his other guests. These were my memories of the people\
  \ who lived in that house.\n\nBut overcoming all these memories was the beauty of\
  \ that house, the haveli. As we ended our stay there, and we started to leave \u2013\
  \ I came across the elderly patriarch of the house in the courtyard, in the heart\
  \ of the house. \u201CYour house is really very beautiful\u201D I said to him, with\
  \ a feeling of complete satisfaction and gratitude but his  reply was tinged in\
  \ a pain that was hardly discernible \u2013 \u201CNow this house is not mine; you\
  \ too have stayed here, so this haveli is yours\u201D.\n\nAt that moment, in Jaisalmer\
  \ \u2013 one of the world\u2019s oldest living forts, in the midst of the local\
  \ people, living in their own house, breaking bread with them \u2013 I felt that\
  \ making a local connection with the people is not always mutual. Sometimes, it\
  \ can be forced decision as well.\n\nGlossary of vernacular terms:\nSonar \u2013\
