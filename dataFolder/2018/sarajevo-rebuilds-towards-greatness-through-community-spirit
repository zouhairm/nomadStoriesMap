Text: "As an outsider visiting Sarajevo, on the surface the city seemed like a melting\
  \ pot between East vs West where religions and orthodoxies lived side by side. However,\
  \ the images and stories I had heard created a perception in my mind of a city with\
  \ a troubled and sad history. My understanding of what happened here was basic and\
  \ thought I best hook up with a local guide to show me round on a half day tour\
  \ that focused on the Siege of Sarajevo. \n\nThings aren\u2019t done in Sarajevo\
  \ the way I would expect them back at home. When you book a tour don\u2019t expect\
  \ anything formal. Despite arriving promptly at the designated meeting point for\
  \ my tour, the guide was nowhere to be seen. Fifteen minutes later after the time\
  \ the guide should have arrived I started to question if I had made an error in\
  \ my booking or been stood up. \n\nSuddenly out of nowhere a young man called out\
  \ my name from a rusty old BMW that looked like it had seen better days. Before\
  \ I could reply the man jumped out and shook my hand and told me his name was Ewas.\
  \ He wasn\u2019t what I expected. Young, hipster and with an inviting smile Ewas\
  \ ushered me to his BMW. \n\nDuring the car ride the guy opened to me like some\
  \ church confessional talking about life as a Muslim Bosnian child in the war. His\
  \ family lived in an apartment with no electricity and risk their lives occasionally\
  \ to go outside just to get food and supplies. He described the shelling, the people\
  \ he lost and the strength his family found to pull through those tough years. Despite\
  \ all this he remained optimistic and at peace with the past. \n\nAs we wandered\
  \ through key sites to the Siege looking at the shelled buildings that had been\
  \ ravaged by gun fire, I began to feel as though I had known him for years like\
  \ a dear friend. I had never felt such a powerful connection with someone who was\
  \ a stranger to me only hours earlier. \n\nWhen we reached the Tunnel of Hope, the\
  \ corridor that provided so many a chance for a new life I felt emotional. After\
  \ witnessing the buildings and Ewas\u2019 stories, this war that hurt Sarajevo went\
  \ from \u2018textbook\u2019 to reality. Ewas taught me that despite Sarajevo showing\
  \ its scars on its buildings, it also wore its heart on its sleeve and that to me\
  \ gave me hope that Sarajevo would rebuild itself to be a great city again."
