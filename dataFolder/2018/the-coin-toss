Text: "The sun sets over Marrakesh old town, deep voices bellow through the spires\
  \ of mosques for the evening prayer. I trace my finger around the silver edge of\
  \ a five-dirham coin and flip it high into the air. It lands with a ding on the\
  \ terracotta tiles of the roof top terrace. Heads. \nThe coin has spoken, next stop\
  \ - the south of Spain, I book a flight from Valencia to Munich.\nIn two weeks I\u2019\
  ll arrive in Germany where I\u2019ll work at the Oktoberfest. I\u2019ll wear lederhosen\
  \ and sell a hat for 15 euros to my future husband. Not that I know that yet...\n\
  \n10 days later\nThe last rays of light are sucked over the horizon of the North\
  \ Atlantic Ocean and evidently I haven\u2019t made it back to Europe. \nI\u2019\
  m counting to 100 in Arabic and walking along-side my newly appointed Moroccan Grandfather\
  \ and coincidental Arabic teacher. I\u2019m somewhere south of Asilah on a private\
  \ beach. \nBaking bread by candlelight, I learn that you don\u2019t need plates\
  \ or cutlery to set the dinner table in Morocco\u2026\n\n48 Hours before the flight\n\
  \u201CRada! Fortor! Ahuna!\u201D\nI\u2019ve squished into a very small straw thatched\
  \ shack with at least ten other adults. The extended family crouch around on the\
  \ cool earth floor clad with black garbage bags. \nI\u2019m tearing off some bread\
  \ and scooping out a thick chunk of tomato and fish curry \u2212 we share a large\
  \ communal bowl in the middle of a small wooden table.\n\u201CRada! Fortor!\u201D\
  \ The ladies are smiling. Pointing at me. Pointing at all the family members, \u201C\
  Ahuna!\u201D pointing off in to the distance\u2026 (this repeats)\nI had planned\
  \ to leave at sunrise. It was a half hour walk along the beach to the nearest road\
  \ (the neighbour\u2019s driveway) where I\u2019d hitch a ride to Asilah and embark\
  \ on my longest ever (cross-continent) commute to an airport\u2026\n\u201CYes, thank\
  \ you, no problems!\u201D I say in Arabic and repeat the words \u2013 \n\u201CRadah\
  \ (Tomorrow?), Fortor (Breakfast?)\u2026 Ahuna\u2026(no idea!)\u201D. \n\n24 Hours\
  \ before the flight\nI walk up to the ridge that overlooks the ocean with \u201C\
  Grandpa\u201D. The aqua coastline stretches out as far as I can see, with not one\
  \ footprint on its shores. \nWe arrive at Ahuna. The family are so proud of their\
  \ little town. \nThe women smile with such warmth. We feast on sweet cakes, bread\
  \ and honey. It\u2019s a simple, peaceful life. They hug me tightly when I have\
  \ to say goodbye.\nIn only four days, somehow, through broken communication, the\
  \ baking and breaking of bread, so much has been exchanged. They feel strangely\
  \ like family.\nI almost make it to Valencia for my flight\u2026 but that\u2019\
  s another story."
