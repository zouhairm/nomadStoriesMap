Text: "My first ever skydive experience at Empuriabrava, Spain on Sunday, the 25th\
  \ June\u201917. \n\nI left for the location early in the morning. I could not eat\
  \ anything because of the excitement and nervousness. I reached the location, finished\
  \ the process of registration and self-declaration forms that had some clause which\
  \ made me even more nervous.\n\nThey did handover me with an instrument that has\
  \ to beep when my chance to dive comes. I was waiting, watching people coming from\
  \ the sky and landing on the Earth. Asking myself the question, what am I doing?\
  \ And suddenly I can hear the beep and I realize, my time to dive has come! And\
  \ with every passing beep, my heart was beating faster.\n\nThen the experience began,\
  \ I was suited up with the jacket for the dive and the other guy started to shoot\
  \ the video and you don\u2019t know what to say and how to express in that moment\
  \ of nervousness. I got into the airplane, which took me to 4000 meters height.\
  \ And then the door opens. I was on the edge of the door, scared and nervous. \n\
  \nI took a deep breath and I jumped! Yes, I did \u2026 A decision that pushed me\
  \ to the edge and made me jump to meet a new fearless me.\n\nThe initial few seconds\
  \ after the jump were like \u201CWhat the hell did I do?\u201D. I thought I\u2019\
  m about to die. But after those initial moments, I came to know that I took the\
  \ best decision of my life,\n\n\u201CJumping out of an airplane from freaking 4000\
  \ meters hight!\u201D\n\nYes, I was flying! The most beautiful experience ever.\n\
  \n50-60 secs of free fall and the view of the Mother Earth fully covered with clouds,\
  \ and when I entered the clouds the instructor opens up the parachute. The beautiful\
  \ parachute ride with the land and the sea view. The instructor gave me the handles\
  \ of the parachute and asked me to ride the parachute. I was like wohoooo!! And\
  \ I did ride it as well.\n\nOnce I landed, I was so happy to successfully complete\
  \ the skydive. The feeling of the first skydive was and always will be so awesome.\
  \ Lifetime memory!\n\nAs said by Will Smith \u201CThe best things in life are on\
  \ the other side of terror, on the other side of your maximum fear, are all of the\
  \ best things in life.\u201D\n\nThe experience to be experienced! :)"
