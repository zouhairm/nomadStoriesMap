Text: "When she slapped me, in the middle of the street, I lost all my naivety. I\
  \ had always been childish and clueless, but that moment changed everything. \n\n\
  She left me there, at night, somewhere near Tokyo. My cheek was still hurting, but\
  \ I could not bring myself to hate her. Partly because it had been so sudden that\
  \ I was still in shock. Partly, because I felt too ashamed to feel angry. I was\
  \ not sure what had triggered her reaction, but I could not help feeling terribly\
  \ guilty. \n\nI was alone, I had no idea which trains I was supposed to take, I\
  \ could not even remember where the train station was. Of course, I had no internet\
  \ data on my phone. And of course, I could not speak any Japanese. I started walking\
  \ in a random direction, until I finally met a young man. He could not speak any\
  \ English, but managed to understand what I was asking, and helped me out.\n\nOnce\
  \ at the train station, I stared at a big map for a while, trying to figure out\
  \ which train to take. I ended up taking a random one, and found myself in a station\
  \ I had never seen before. Despite the language barrier, a guard managed to explain\
  \ to me that I had gone in the wrong direction. I felt a bit heartbroken, but at\
  \ least he showed me which train I could take in order to arrive to my destination.\
  \ \n\nWhen I opened the door of her apartment, I heard the sound of running water,\
  \ and I knew she was taking a shower. That was the first thing I noticed, before\
  \ lowering my eyes and seeing my suitcase on the floor. All my clothes were messily\
  \ piled up on it. I packed my things, I stole a banana, then I left. I certainly\
  \ could not afford an hotel in Tokyo, so I decided to spend the night on a bench,\
  \ and wait for the first coach to the airport. \n\nWhile I was shivering because\
  \ of the cold, I suddenly remembered a girl I had met a few days before. She had\
  \ been travelling around Asia for several months, and when I met her she told me\
  \ all kinds of stories. I was so amazed by her courageousness that I asked her:\
  \ \u201CWere you not afraid?\u201D She replied: \u201CImagine you are at a train\
  \ station in India. They stole your phone, your wallet, and your luggage. You cannot\
  \ speak their language. What do you do?\u201D I stared at her, waiting. \u201CWell,\
  \ first you look for something to eat. You go back to the basis, to your first needs,\
  \ and find a solution, slowly, step by step.\u201D \n\nSo, I laid on that bench,\
  \ ate two onigiris and a stolen banana, covered myself with a couple of coats and\
  \ waited for the first lights of dawn."
