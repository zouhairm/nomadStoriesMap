Text: "My forehead leaning against the cold glass, I stare at the pouring rain. My\
  \ eyes follow a lonely bead of rain, slipping down this transparent wall to its\
  \ inevitable loss. Behind the window, the sprawling city of Manila is swallowed\
  \ by a thick fog and a heavy rain curtain. This blurry scenery dissolves itself\
  \ in a growing monochrome stain. Around me, dozens of people walk, back and forth,\
  \ trying to find a path to step in or out of this outdated Filipino bus. They avoid\
  \ touching me at the last moment, probably wondering why this strange girl does\
  \ not follow the continuous ballet of bodies that swarm and scatter without ever\
  \ meeting each other. A deafening noise overwhelms me. Mixed with the chant of this\
  \ foreign language, the overly loud music is barely covering the hubbub of car horns.\
  \ This cacophony slams against my ears, but I am deaf to the external world. The\
  \ town streams in front of my eyes. Spicy odors and incense perfumes mixed with\
  \ fuel vapors filter through the window and assail my nostrils. Traffic is chaotic:\
  \ tuk-tuks, bikes, cars, buses and pedestrians are fighting with no mercy  at every\
  \ street corner. The dampness drowns me into a heavy torpor. Have I made the right\
  \ choice? I left everything behind: my flat, my Parisian life, my relatives, my\
  \ man\u2026. For what? I am not sure anymore. I gaze upon the crowd, searching for\
  \ an answer, but my eyes do not cling to anyone. I am alone, standing in front of\
  \ the open arms of the unknown. I reminisce about the ones that I just left. Those\
  \ arms that either held me with passion, or rejected me with anger. Those hands\
  \ that would mark my body with love, until a sudden change of mood would lead them\
  \ to befall onto my delicate skin. I shudder. A tear falls of my eyelash. It softly\
  \ rolls down, drawing a humid furrow in this dark blue shadow laid under my eye.\
  \ Travelling has always been my dream, I did not know it would become my remedy.\
  \ \nAs I straighten, I reach the village of Santa Juliana. Infinite paddy fields\
  \ hug the road. Rays of sun pierce the clouds and bounce off the glistening strands\
  \ of rice gently dancing with the wind. Under this delicate light, the vegetation\
  \ adorns itself with a golden dress. The beaded dew on the simmering grass stretches\
  \ and reflects the warm colors of the sunset. The stifling dampness gives space\
  \ to a welcomed freshness. Far away, Mount Pinatubo and its native forest awaits\
  \ for me. I feel  my heart lighter. I step out of the bus, smiling at this life\
  \ that now belongs only to me."
