Text: "I step down off the bus onto the empty gravel road, the bus doors clatter shut\
  \ behind me. I stand still for a moment, my bag at my feet and my mind repeatedly\
  \ asking why I have done this to myself. Here I am; in Nagysz\xE9kely - rural Hungary,\
  \ about to spend the next 10 days volunteering on a farm for board and food. \n\n\
  I heave my bag on my back and begin walking away from the dishevelled bus stop with\
  \ only the broken English directions provided by the only other passenger on the\
  \ bus to guide me. Five minutes into my fifteen minute trek I see in the distance\
  \ a figure appear; ruffled dusty orange hair, worn out black tracksuit pants with\
  \ a blue tee-shirt riddled with holes. The rider slows to a stop when they reach\
  \ me and with a tentative voice they say my name - I nod and the rider swings off\
  \ the bike and extends his hand. 'I am Karl, we must hurry as I have left the children\
  \ and kittens alone in the garden.'\n\nUpon arriving at the house I was given a\
  \ tour; the house was built in 1909 and bought cheaply due to the deportation of\
  \ ethnic Germans after WWI, part of the roof was falling in and the shed was in\
  \ dire need of repairs. My accommodation would be in a tent that was set up under\
  \ a walnut tree at the back of the garden - just up the path from the composting\
  \ toilet which felt a lot closer depending on the direction of the wind. Karl fished\
  \ out a stained mattress which he spent 10 minutes ferociously beating in an effort\
  \ to remove years of dust.\n\nOver the following week and a half I learnt many things\
  \ about Hungarian culture, politics and about the town community. Karl, an Austrian\
  \ meteorologist, moved to the neighbouring country to be with his wife Edit. I will\
  \ forever cherish the nights spent drinking nettle tea and homemade bread talking\
  \ about climate change and the future of humanity whilst playing African drums.\
  \ I am still in touch with the family and regularly remind them how hot it is in\
  \ Australia as they sit inside watching it snow. And although our lives are seemingly\
  \ worlds apart, we were still able to find commonalities through our experiences\
  \ and beliefs. I do not know if I will ever return on to that town via a beaten\
  \ up bus, but regardless, I know I will never forget it."
