Text: "My journey began with a trip to Cueva de las Manos, a cave which features art\
  \ work from indigenous people roughly created about 10,000 years ago. I traveled\
  \ with the touring group, Estancia, where I met an Argentine couple. Once inside,\
  \ I exclaimed at the beauty and vibrant colors of the animals and handprints. I\
  \ turned to the couple and said, \u201CCan you believe these have lasted for so\
  \ many centuries?\u201D This started a friendly conversation where they informed\
  \ me that they were archaeologists from a University in Buenos Aires. Although the\
  \ tour guide did a great job describing the site and the history, the couple were\
  \ able to add interesting bits of information. Of special importance was the need\
  \ for a permanent committee in the local town of Perito Moreno, in part to prevent\
  \ degradation from tourists. After we left the cave, they invited me to come visit\
  \ them when I returned to Buenos Aires. \n\nWhen I arrived in Buenos Aires, I headed\
  \ straight to their home. I was a little nervous, as I wasn\u2019t sure if their\
  \ offer was a real one. However, the couple welcomed me with open arms and gave\
  \ me a room all to myself. That night we decided to go to a local Tango club. Although\
  \ I have some experience with partner dancing, I had not learned Tango. I was shocked\
  \ to discover that my new friends were expert Tango dancers, taking over the dance\
  \ floor and earning cheers from onlookers. The man was more than happy to provide\
  \ some beginner instruction afterwards to me in a corner far from the crowd. I managed\
  \ to only step on his feet three times.\n\nWe were getting along so well, the couple\
  \ decided to take me to Iguazu Falls, known as one of the Seven Natural Wonders\
  \ of the World. We decided to go on a Jetboat safari. It was absolutely thrilling\
  \ and took us right into Devil\u2019s Throat where we braved the dangerous rapids.\
  \ I had never been on a rafting trip before and this was an amazing experience with\
  \ alternating emotions of pure panic and exhilaration. It was the one of the best\
  \ experiences of my life. \n\nMy trip would have never been the same without meeting\
  \ this wonderful couple. I am truly grateful for their friendship and highly recommend\
  \ connecting with locals in order to make the most out of travelling."
