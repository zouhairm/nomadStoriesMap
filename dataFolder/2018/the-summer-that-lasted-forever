Text: "As I watch the sun set in the Frankfurt sky through my flight window ,I find\
  \ the memories of my summer in this foreign land tug at my heart.If I had been told\
  \ a year ago that I would get a chance to intern in Germany and visit the countries\
  \ and cities in Europe which I\u2019d only read about, I would have laughed. Dreams,\
  \ however, have a way of coming true when you least expect them to. You remember\
  \ those cliched movies where a girl rediscovers herself in another country? By some\
  \ miracle, that girl happened to be me last summer.I close my eyes and let the tide\
  \ of memories engulf me.\n\nOne of the earliest memories I have is being greeted\
  \ by a smiling elderly lady who was going to be my host and she dispelled all qualms\
  \ I possessed.My lab mates and professor made me feel instantly welcome as well.\
  \ Before arriving I had counted the weekends available to me: 8. Needless to say,\
  \ I started preparing for my first trip.I planned a trip to Amsterdam and lost myself\
  \ in the picturesque canals and the tulip gardens. I also met and interacted with\
  \ people from different nationalities:from Iran,Belgium,Egypt and the list kept\
  \ increasing! i found myself looking forward to travelling by the Euro Rail for\
  \ there were always so many interesting people to talk to.I would listen to their\
  \ experiences and life stories and recount my own from India.Next week, I explored\
  \ Prague; walking on the Charle\u2019s bridge at night was nothing short of a fantasy.\
  \ There's something about Prague that resounded within me;the beautiful city was\
  \ nothing short of a fairy-tale setting at night! While returning to Germany, we\
  \ stopped at the German-Czech Republic Border.I got off the bus and I was straddling\
  \ the state line and was at two countries at once!How could I leave Europe without\
  \ planning a trip to the mesmerising Paris?After almost missing the bus and meeting\
  \ friends in the process, we went to the top of the Eiffel tower and clicked loads\
  \ of selfies.We even had to run in Paris for fear of not making it to our bus on\
  \ time! Switzerland was next on my list and there are no words to explain the natural\
  \ beauty of the country.I celebrated my 21st birthday in Hamburg by going on a cruise\
  \ and a jazz club.I travelled,met new people,had different cuisines and the last\
  \ thing I expected was to rediscover myself.\n\nI realise with a pang that the summer\
  \ has come to an end.The flight is about to take off,when I find someone sit beside\
  \ me.\"Where are you from?\",he asks me.I smile.Maybe the summer isn't over yet!:)"
