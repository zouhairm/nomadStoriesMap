Text: "it was 30/12/2017,\nThe last few days of the 2017,the days that  pushed my\
  \ limit to make a choice which made  2018 my year.\nI always feels,\" its the day\
  \ i listened to my heart and soul which lead me to believe the 'magic of love'.\n\
  \nFirst it was in the  train with similar faces as i start my way from kottayam\
  \ and as the train moves i didnt notice the fact that,distance were merely numbers,\
  \ slowly everything inside and outside start to change.\nOn the way,there were faces\
  \ which made me believe there is hope always and there began the solo-travel of\
  \ the 'old soul with a young crazy mind'...!!\nSo this is my first stay on the train.i\
  \ have traveled so many times in this but never had a chance to be where im right\
  \ now.\n\n\n31/12/2017,banglore\nOn that day with all the colors and star,the night\
  \ welcomed 2018 and when it happened somebody said 'its mine' .Without a second\
  \ thought i believed in it.\ni closed my eyes...\ntook a deep breathe and \nexhaled\
  \ a simple smile \nwhich made me to dream it and stay there...\nfrom now onward\
  \ the dream become the reality and life become a celebration to find the mystic\
  \ and soul's purpose...\n1/1/2018\nThe new year started with a ROSE from an smiling\
  \ face at the bus stop whom i met for the first time.\nNear the city mall,i happen\
  \ to see a man who sell stationary items,from there i bought something that always\
  \ fit perfect above my head with a question mark and a quote \"its change time\"\
  \ ... i wondered and said to myself 'believe in magic'..\n\n4/1/2018\nBanglore,a\
  \ place of hope and opportunities.People are busy with their daily routines and\
  \ in between i found my tribes in there, they were more than something special.They\
  \ lead me to their world and i was amazed to see such a different life style.Most\
  \ of all,i didnt knew them till i reach there.\nDays spend there and mind starts\
  \ to wander for the rest of the journey. \nI knew my soul is searching for the answers,that\
  \ once went through me..\nMagically after 2 year,I decided to meet ROHAN.\nIt was\
  \ fun learning to dealt with thing so much differently .Finally i got the bus to\
  \ see him,which i thought was a 2 or 3 hrs road trip but happily it was a 350 km\
  \ ride and i was almost alone in the bus.Slept with meditating pose and books at\
  \ the right side.It wonders me of how im moving there to here.\nWhen you truly believe\
  \ in something and taking conscious effort to do it you will understand this\n\"\
  Life is about making who we wanna be \" .From there, MR.THOPPIKARAN and his new\
  \ crazy thoughts \"ITS CHANGE TIME\" born ..!"
