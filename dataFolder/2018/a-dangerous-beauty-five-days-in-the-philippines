Text: "The polluted streets of Cebu City were crowded with colorfully decorated miniature\
  \ buses that looked like portable murals. After paying the equivalent of one U.S.\
  \ dollar, I quickly hopped on and joined the packed bus of fearless Cebuanos dangling\
  \ off the back. I watched several stray dogs ignore motorists as they ran in and\
  \ out of the streets.\n\nThe dirt roads were lined with eateries selling everything\
  \ from pigs feet and passion fruit to fresh coconut juice and spicy peanuts. We\
  \ passed prominent landmarks that were surrounded by dilapidated wooden houses and\
  \ small shacks with bamboo-thatched roofs where people still hand washed and line\
  \ dried their clothes. \n\nMy initial impression of Cebu Island was bleak, but I\
  \ found unexpected beauty in its people. \u201CWhy are you here alone?\u201D and\
  \ \u201CWhy are you still single?\u201D were the two most popular questions asked\
  \ by Filipinos I met along the way. When they learned that I was an American from\
  \ Massachusetts, they often serenaded me with the Bee Gees song of the same name.\
  \ Every Filipino I met was full of liveliness, love, kindness, and humility. \n\n\
  Most Filipinos don\u2019t have a lot, but they give you a lot of what they don\u2019\
  t have. I spent a short time with a local family who shared a traditional Filipino\
  \ breakfast of sweet instant coffee and bread called pan de sal. A 23-year-old nurse\
  \ named \u201CYummy\u201D arranged a free tour for me on the southeast countryside\
  \ of Bohol Island. She taught me a handful of safety tips. \u201CAlways carry a\
  \ fake wallet, so when someone tries to rob you, he ends up with an empty wallet\
  \ filled with love notes,\u201D she said. \n\nThe most memorable part of my journey\
  \ was spent in Moalboal, a town in the southwestern part of Cebu Province. A local\
  \ guide named Adonis took me on a two-hour motorbike ride to the neighboring town\
  \ of Badian, so I could ride a bamboo raft under the Kawasan Falls. As we weaved\
  \ across the winding roads, I took in the breathtaking landscapes of green and lush\
  \ rolling hills, mangos trees, and rice fields. Feeling the sun on my face and smelling\
  \ the ocean breeze made me forget about the pollution from the city. I knew I had\
  \ nothing to fear when a biker holding a baby on his lap zoomed past us. Apparently\
  \ this was the Filipino way. \n\nIf you want to escape the rest of the world, come\
  \ to the Philippines, but don\u2019t expect to escape the Filipino love and spirit\
  \ that is so abundant here. It\u2019s a place to have an adventure if you are a\
  \ thrill seeker, to enjoy nature, or simply to reflect and just be."
