Text: "Dust kicked up from the casual soccer game dulled the brilliant blue sky that\
  \ hung overhead. I stood on the edge of the grassless field and watched as the participants,\
  \ all aged somewhere between six and thirteen, ran back and forth. Their shrieks\
  \ and shouts filled the otherwise quiet town center. Even in Tijuana, Mexico, the\
  \ temperature was unusually warm for late November.\n  The small community of El\
  \ Florido is only a forty minute drive from the San Diego US\\Mexico border, but,\
  \ the barren landscape accompanied by the plywood and tin-roofed shacks the locals\
  \ called home made the distance seem even further. \n I felt a small tug on the\
  \ leg of my jeans. In front of me, a little girl of about seven shyly smiled up\
  \ at me- I knelt in the dust. \n \xA8Hello, what is your name,\xA8 I asked in shaky\
  \ Spanish.\n \xA8Sofia,\xA8 she giggled back quietly. Her worn blue dress and pink\
  \ leggings were covered in stains and dirt. She grabbed my hand and led me on the\
  \ field. \n  It had been years since I last touched a soccer ball, much less kicked\
  \ one. Remembering this only added to the feeling of apprehension I had felt for\
  \ most of the trip.\n  With only a couple of meters before reaching the heart of\
  \ the game, I stopped. What I thought was an ordinary game of soccer was anything\
  \ but so. A closer look revealed the \xA8ball\xA8 was nothing other than a lemon.\
  \ \n  \xA8No tenemos una pelota,\xA8 Sofia said with a gappy smile after seeing\
  \ a look of shock on my face. I could not say anything back, and she ran off to\
  \ join the rest of the group.\n  We do not have a ball. The sentence rang through\
  \ my head over and over. For them, such a statement was not given a second thought;\
  \ the details of what made a lemon, a lemon, and a ball, a ball, were blurred as\
  \ long as the bigger picture was clear. \n  Conversations I had with locals over\
  \ the past few days took on different meanings as I watched the lemon awkwardly\
  \ bounce over the rocks and trash littering the ground. The recent 2016 US presidential\
  \ election was the inspiration for my trip and the cause of the fear and worry the\
  \ community shared. With many of them depending on family members working in the\
  \ US for survival, the ambiguous question remained unstated: what happens now? \n\
  \  The lemon went through the goal post and Sofia excitedly waved over at me. For\
  \ now, the answer was to make the best of the situation, just as Sofia and the rest\
  \ of the children did. \n   I jogged the rest of the way across the field as the\
  \ goalie kicked the lemon back into play."
