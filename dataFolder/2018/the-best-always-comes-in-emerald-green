Text: "Travelling through the ravishing lanes adorned with beautiful trees and magnificent\
  \ landscapes always drove me to ecstasy.  I travel every year to this breathtakingly\
  \ gorgeous destination. You may think I'm speaking about the sumptuous Swiss Alps\
  \ or the riveting skyline of Norway. Well, I might just disappoint you a little.\
  \ I'm talking about Goa, a small city, in fact, the smallest in the country of India.\
  \ However, I had no clue that the winter of December 2017 would change my life,\
  \ forever. Who would have thought that you'd experience a place you've been to almost\
  \ every year so differently, in a jiffy? Well, I did. Never in my life will I ever\
  \ see the tiny village of Arambol the same way. \n\nWalking down the roads of the\
  \ same old streets, I saw newer faces and people of mixed cultures. No one seemed\
  \ to care if you were black, white, brown or copper skinned. With a mix of reggae,\
  \ pop, rock and folk playing, music lovers gathered around each other and danced\
  \ to every type of music. There ahead lied a heavenly beach with tables and candles\
  \ lit on top of them. Above it all, the sky illuminated a perfect satin purple,\
  \ sprinkled with stars. This looked nothing less than a scene out of a Twilight\
  \ movie. It was magical. Some smoking pot, others making merry with a glass of wine\
  \ in their hands. Lovers caressing each other as if there was no tomorrow and music\
  \ engulfing the sea kissed breeze that enveloped the entire place. \nThis was something\
  \ even Vincent Van Gogh could never do justice to, if he were to turn this prepossessing\
  \ sight into art. \n\nAmbling futher down, I reached the end of the road. Little\
  \ did I know that the end was only the start of something new. I saw the most beautiful\
  \ man with the smile of an archangel. 6 foot tall, with emerald green eyes and ivory\
  \ skin.  All we did was exchange glances. There's this feeling you get, when you\
  \ look at something almost flawless and want to touch it. You don't always get what\
  \ you want, do you? What I saw was a sight to behold. It might never be mine, but\
  \ it'll always be etched in my memory for years to come. \n\nIsn't it crazy how\
  \ your life actually becomes routine? Is it eerie how that one second could change\
  \ your life forever and you wouldn't even know?\nIf I stand there again, he won't\
  \ be there, but my thoughts will paint the beautiful scene of my favourite emerald\
  \ green eyes that'll beat anything created by any artist ever. The one that I least\
  \ expected. The one that still makes me close my eyes and reminisce."
