Text: "A wave of panic surges through me culminating in tiny drops of sweat on my\
  \ scalp. The realization that there is only door in this crowded church results\
  \ in a claustrophobia attack, the likes of which I have not experienced before.\
  \  \nI am visiting San Juan Chamula in Chiapas, Mexico on the celebration of the\
  \ Virgin of the Guadalupe, the Patron Saint of all Mexico.  The recent sunny skies\
  \ that warm the thin air of this pueblo located at 7200 ft are replaced today by\
  \ a penetrating drizzle and gusting wind. The shiny wet flagstones in front of the\
  \ church reflect the leaden skies and amplify the deafening, sporadic booms of the\
  \ fireworks used in the celebrations.  The indigenous  Chamulan people congregating\
  \ there are well protected by their native dress.  The fabric is a densely woven\
  \ black wool with a long nap, almost identical in appearance to the fake acrylic\
  \ fur of a Halloween Godzilla costume.  The wool is provided by their sheep which\
  \ are considered sacred in Chamulan culture. For generations these people have understood\
  \ that wool stays warm even when wet. \nAs I enter the church, a think fug of incense\
  \ hits my nasal passages in a too-much-wasabi like rush.  The floor is strewn with\
  \ a carpet of pine needles in tribute to Mother Earth.  Family groups pass around\
  \ glasses of a local sugar-cane based hooch called Pox as they invite their Mayan\
  \ Gods to celebrate with them.  Several men are passed out cold under the wood and\
  \ glass caskets containing wooden effigies of Catholic saints, sleeping off too\
  \ much Pox.\nSome families are working with Curanderos, local medicine men.  One\
  \ woman carefully lifts a brown speckled hen from a basket and places it on the\
  \ floor.  The hen appears to be calmly awaiting its fate, just a few rapid darts\
  \ of its beady bird eyes, before the woman presses down firmly on its fragile rib-cage\
  \ and suffocates it, in an act of sacrifice to add to the power of her prayers.\n\
  The Chamulans were some of the last Mayans to succumb to the Spanish after the conquest\
  \ in 1524.  Initially the Mayans had to succumb to some Christian practices to avoid\
  \ bloody persecution. Conversely, the Catholics tolerated some Mayan rituals and\
  \ beliefs combined with traditional Catholic rites, to afford them better control\
  \ over the masses;  Anything for a quiet life.    \nIn a world that is becoming\
  \ more culturally homogenous every year, finding the Chamulans was like the calming\
  \ breath of cool, clean, fresh air that filled my lungs as I exited the church."
