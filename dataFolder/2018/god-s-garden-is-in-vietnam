Text: "\u201CWe, Vietnamese people are so happy that there\u2019s no war anymore,\
  \ that we don\u2019t talk about war, or politics, we talk about life\u201D. He looks\
  \ at me with his intriguing little black eyes, which practically fade in a line\
  \ every time he lightens his face with a huge smile. His name is Bing (Peaceful),\
  \ no other name would had suit him better, he transmits peace just by looking at\
  \ you.\n\nWe drink fresh coconut juice while we wander in a wooden boat through\
  \ the Mekong River. Muddy water below us and surrounded by a humidity scented air\
  \ and palm trees full of coconuts, we greet the smiling people watching us from\
  \ their boats, colorful flowers embellish every corner.\n\nHaving listened magical\
  \ stories about the breathtaking landscapes and sunsets, floating villages and mythical\
  \ creatures, living in the heart of the brave and friendly people who call this\
  \ amazing garden-ish look alike country home, I knew I had to visit Vietnam and\
  \ it was no mistake.\n\nIt is a cloudy day; you can barely discover some sun rays\
  \ between the clouds. We arrive at 10:00  a.m. after having an amazing meal in a\
  \ local restaurant were we had the best Poh bowl you\u2019ll ever taste and a strongly\
  \ scented Vietnamese coffee: An espresso with condensed milk and ice. Strong but\
  \ sweet, just like Vietnamese people. \n\nI then realized that Ho Chi Minh wasn\u2019\
  t at all what I expected, wide avenues covered with motorcycles that sound the horn\
  \ night and day,  narrow houses of at least 3 floors, painted in different colors,\
  \ some with clear signs of humidity and with plants growing on their walls. The\
  \ strong scent of river, the rust on the balconies and the intense heat, remind\
  \ me that we are in a tropical city cut far and wide by water.\n\nIt was a 2 hours\
  \ trip to the small jetty were we took the boat, but with Binh telling me his family\u2019\
  s story, time flies.\n\n\"My parents are farmers, they have worked in the fields\
  \ all their lives and that is the fate of my younger brother too, he has already\
  \ been forced to drop school to start working in the fields, he used to speak English\
  \ better than me, but when he dropped school and stopped practicing he forgot everything\
  \ he had learned, - he laughs-, that\u2019s the fate of the youngest children in\
  \ the farmer families while older siblings need to go to the big cities to work\
  \ and provide money to the family\u2026 Someone need to look after the parents,\
  \ you know?\u201D \u2013 He sighs-, and we got lost in each one\u2019s thoughts,\
  \ feeling the air in our faces, not knowing what the future will depart for us."
