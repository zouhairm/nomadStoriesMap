Text: "A wall, razor wire, surveillance cameras and solders carrying guns. The desert\
  \ around as equally within the hearts. Two worlds kept apart by tons of concrete.\
  \ Some view it as a security barrier, others see it as a symbol that steals their\
  \ dignity while few perceive it through the lenses of its transformational potential.This\
  \ contradictory nature becomes cumbrous when the sign near the wall indicates that\
  \ I had just arrived to Bethlehem. Overwhelmed by this reality, I wanted to return\
  \ immediately to Jerusalem and leave Israel. While thinking about my return route\
  \ and admiring the only shade of colour that countered the grey reality of this\
  \ place (Banksy\u2019s work), I heard a voice near me saying in a rusty English:\
  \ \u201CDon\u2019t go and judge God for the rest of your life!Come and see the place\
  \ through my eyes\u201D. Skeptical, I turned around and met Afeef, grandfather of\
  \ two nephews and a citizen of Bethlehem. \nIntrigued by the fact that this man\
  \ guessed my intention, the tourist in me gained and we started to walk toward the\
  \ old city. Here, the narrative related to the separation wall lost its significance\
  \ since a different reality revealed before my eyes.\u201CPeople come here in search\
  \ for hope and faith. Prepare yourself to abandon a path while finding another\u201D\
  , Afeef told me before entering the Church of the Nativity. Indeed, the place where\
  \ Jesus was born could be the real symbol of unity. Here, people from all around\
  \ the world, Christians, Muslims or even individuals guided by curiosity, can find\
  \ a common denominator, a world without barriers.  \nTrying to express my feelings,\
  \ I turned around and saw Aleef on his way to the entrance waving his hand toward\
  \ me. It seemed like his mission had come to an end. No other words appeared more\
  \ suited for this moment than \u201Cthe world is gone, I must carry you!\u201D It\
  \ was clear to me that Aleef saw the wall as a way to evolve and embrace a different\
  \ reality, hence we must be able to carry the new persona that we become and wise\
  \ enough to carry others on their path to a new persona. Even at this point, I would\
  \ not know to say if Aleef was just a regular Palestinian grandfather or an occasional\
  \ tourist guide, but for sure he was a wise spirit able to seize uncommon things.\
  \ With his help, Bethlehem proved to be \u201Chouse of bread\u201D (i.d. the translation\
  \ for Bet Lehem) for thought and vision in my case.  After all, we are surrounded\
  \ by our own \u201Cwalls\u201D and each has to gain over and over a certain degree\
  \ of freedom along the way. Shalom/Salaam!"
