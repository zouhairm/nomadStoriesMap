Text: "It seems like i should have a fancy opening, or a catch phrase to grab your\
  \ attention . But all i have is me I threathened for months that the impending \
  \ pressure was mounting,  my point of self awareness was but a glimmer .\nMy greatest\
  \ debate  was to drive away and start a fresh new  life or take out another life\
  \ insurance policy  and let  my children benefit  from my death .\nEither one sounds\
  \ dramatic but thats exactly how i felt. Noone believed i would do either but so\
  \ many  showed  up  to take my personal possession ..Like crows chasing  after a\
  \ shiny object , they flocked around me .\nMy doctor told me. Its depression take\
  \ these pills you'll feel better  ..my thoughts were well past a pill ...i needed\
  \ a life changing experience and thats what i got .\nIt just so happened that at\
  \ the same time my bestfriend  was looking for a change ...i told her im selling\
  \ my belongings  and sending the girls with their father to live.Now most people\
  \ would sit back and say how selfish of these women in their 40's to put their own\
  \ needs first ..to only think of  themselves before their children . They never\
  \ had to tell their children  there was nothing to eat  or send them to school and\
  \ ask them to lie about forgetting their lunch because there was no money or food\
  \ left ,how easy it is to judge. \nSo two mentally and emotionally  wrecked souls\
  \ set out on an adventure  of their life  not knowing what the outcome would be\
  \ .\nFor four days of driving .crying .sleeping  across canada  for a girl that\
  \  was to afraid to ever really leave her hometown , it was over whelming and mesmerizing\
  \  at the same time . Passing through  towns and big cities ,questioning  my whole\
  \ life .when did i become lost ? What is my purpose? Right or wrong it became my\
  \ mission to find me ,to learn about me ,to learn to love me ,the biggest challenge\
  \ self acceptance .i no longer fit in the single mom of three category ,no more\
  \ gymnastics,cadets,doctors,birthday parties,movie dates .\nI was alone for the\
  \ first time since i was 18 ...i had no supper to make ,no lunch to pack ..no agenda\
  \ to sign ..So where does a lost soul go to find themselves  , Alberta Canada. \
  \ Only makes sense if you've never away from home . Lots of jobs and it's 5000kms\
  \ away from the stress.\nI would love to write the first year was wonderful,but\
  \ i spent most of it crying  and having terrifying  panic attacks ,\nBut slowly\
  \ i was becoming ..transforming into the person i desired to be Me"
