Text: "People came here for a statistically improbable number of reasons. Most recently\
  \ it was blessed with the lazy golfing trip of an exhausted, retired American President,\
  \ and revered Nobel Peace Prize winner who was rumoured to have started a few wars\
  \ here and there. Preceding this it was the fairytale Scottish landscape of a royal\
  \ romance, somewhere before or after it became the feeding ground for rich, handsome\
  \ and aged celebrities with a passion for golf, drink, and pretty young university\
  \ girls. The golfers left the door to the prestigious university campus close. And\
  \ this is all long, long after the tragedies and burnt bodies of the Protestant\
  \ Reformation.\n\n600 years later, the Scottish coastal town of St Andrews has a\
  \ film department I sometimes occupy until I find the drug habit that I mistakenly\
  \ asked for acutely impairing the linearity of my memory and shifting the boundaries\
  \ of reality. I still dig and arrange my records the way you would claw at gum stuck\
  \ in your hair. But I remember I came here not for glory, love, or book-based knowledge,\
  \ but the outstandingly unimpressive desire to meet snow. \u2018Snow\u2019 is not\
  \ a name, theological manifesto nor ancient Celtic ritual. I wanted to see real\
  \ snow, the drab geological phenomenon, up close and personal. Eighteen years I\u2019\
  d spent roasted under my third world sun, and I was ready for my toe dip into the\
  \ first word sea. I was a girl with a country of six seasons in a year, and I fittingly\
  \ yearned for a country with four seasons in a day.\nThere you have my grand justification\
  \ for placing my destination of temporary living in the rather quaint three streets\
  \ that housed a number of wayward geniuses and a degenerate few like me. This scrawny,\
  \ conservative, classist, elitist, unique, alive and vibrant town promised me snow\
  \ so I gave it a year of my life.  \n\nIn Hogmanay, I found myself in Edinburgh\
  \ next to a man who liked Jhumpa Lahiri and made a decent living out of smuggling\
  \ mysterious baggies of miscellaneous powders that looked like snow. When I worked\
  \ the courage of inhaling lines, it brought an endless supply of people who heard\
  \ me yelling nonsense outside clubs and showed me the right way to empty my bank\
  \ account.\n\nAt the hospital in this foreign mental ward I am being examined, I\
  \ have a view of the snow falling this beautiful, globally-warmed April. I wonder\
  \ if this some kind of prophetic oxymoronic symbol or fever dream of withdrawal.\
  \ Then I decide I\u2019ve lost my fascination with snow."
