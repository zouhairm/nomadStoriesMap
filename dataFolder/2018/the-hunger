Text: "I stood in the center of action, starving for hunger, unable to think and act,\
  \ when I saw three women approach with their hands held out. I knew exactly why\
  \ and what. My worriless smile froze with ignorance. Paralyzed, I cried in desperation\
  \ while I dug for hope for deeper why\u2019s. \u2018How can this be?\u2019 I thought\
  \ when suddenly, I felt a touch. Her raisin hand in a skinny frame sent a sharp\
  \ shock through my heart. I looked down, and in her eyes, I saw sorrow never seen\
  \ before. In a drought of answers, I turned my sight, when once again, her hand\
  \ clutched mine. Unwillingly I became her faith. In voiceless agony, her body screamed\
  \ \u2013 \u201CCan you help me? I need food!\u201D With crumbling lips, I shook\
  \ my head.\n\nShe was sixty. No, eighty? Her scars from genocide left room for theories.\
  \ As did my foreign misleading heritage. I looked nothing like Cambodians. I had\
  \ not seen millions die in my land. But I guess, she had. Not just fellow citizens,\
  \ but also her flesh and blood. No wonder she swam in dark. Fortunate enough to\
  \ survive the Khmer Rouge vicious four-year regime that sent the wealthy to reincarnate.\
  \ Four decades had flown by, but did she flourish in what seemed an unlived life?\
  \ All I knew, I was her wallet, a savior from heavens.\n\nAn hour ago, in search\
  \ of a Promised Land, I left Siem Reap. With dust flying, I saw a market of a vegan\
  \ dream. Wherever I gazed, I breathed poverty, all confused. \u2018This is how they\
  \ feed their family\u2019, I thought, \u2018by selling some to buy some\u2019. I\
  \ couldn\u2019t ask anything from anyone. Petrified to upgrade my game, to admit,\
  \ I also need help. An assumption \u2013 who travels has money \u2013 was a twisted\
  \ truth of mine.\n\nI had $900 sheltered in the 16kg I hauled. Enough to feed a\
  \ herd of cries and their siblings to come but that was not what I signed up for.\
  \ Days prior I abandoned money to learn lessons never learned before. Not to punish\
  \ self but to awake the greater truth in it all.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s temporarily\u2019\
  , I thought. \u2018Money is not a solution to everything. If I would give in to\
  \ the begging nature, I would only create dependency. If I would help them today,\
  \ who would help them tomorrow, and then a day after tomorrow, and so forth, in\
  \ the same location? Who,\u2019 I wondered? \u2018There has to be a better way to\
  \ help them. A model where they could feel a part of the community, where they can\
  \ contribute, not because they need to but because they want to. In it, my handout\
  \ is not the answer.\u2019\n\nWith pain, I left, knowing, my hunger birthed a spiritual\
  \ thirst."
