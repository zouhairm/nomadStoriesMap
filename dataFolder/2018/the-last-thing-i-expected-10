Text: "The last thing I expected\nIt\u2019s going to be a small story about big country\
  \ called United Arab Emirates. On my first and only travel I was lucky to visit\
  \ three cities of this incredible land. \nThere are not enough words to describe\
  \ my feelings during the trip. I didn\u2019t realize that my dream was going to\
  \ come true, until I saw enormous buildings, luxury cars and hotels, palms and perfect\
  \ road. You get more sensitive and surprised when you understand that those buildings\
  \ were built in the dessert. \nThat moment when I realized that all the happenings\
  \ were true, I couldn\u2019t stop my tears from falling down. I was thankful to\
  \ my parents, they gave all their money to their child\u2019s happiness.\nBut the\
  \ reason I came to the Emirates was not to travel. Here starts the most interesting\
  \ part of the story, but I wish it wouldn\u2019t happen.\nA month earlier I took\
  \ part in a conference and won a trip to the international conference in Dubai.\
  \ But it cost not little money. Nevertheless my parents decided to let me go, they\
  \ believed I would win. And I won. But this was the last thing I expected.\nThere\
  \ were 15 participants from my country. We were told that the conference will be\
  \ held in the conference hall of the hotel. It was strange, but I didn\u2019t care\
  \ much, I was too nervous about my speech. \nWhen the conference started there were\
  \ only 15 participants. Yes, all are from my country. And the judges were our organizers.\
  \ To say that I was shocked is to say nothing at all. To my great surprise, it was\
  \ okay for everyone. Everyone knew it, except me. They have travelled with this\
  \ organization and participated the \u201Cconferences\u201D a few times.\nThe strangest\
  \ part of this \u201Cconference\u201D was rewarding. All the participants took first\
  \ places. Then I realized that they\u2019re ready to pay twice as much money to\
  \ be rewarded with medal and certificate of \u201Cinternational\u201D standard.\n\
  I couldn\u2019t believe that I have spent so much money for that fake conference.\
  \ What would I say to my parents? That question worried me a lot. Fortunately, they\
  \ didn\u2019t get angry, sad or disappointed. They were proud of me, anyway. \n\
  At least I was happy to see magical cities Dubai, Sharjah and Abu-Dhabi with my\
  \ own eyes. I didn\u2019t have a chance to visit Burj-Khalifa, go on a safari. I\u2019\
  m sure this country needs more than three days to discover it. So one day I want\
  \ to come back and end what I started."
