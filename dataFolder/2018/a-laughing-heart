Text: "The sun was set high in that Anacortes sky. My motorcycle was silent now after\
  \ my first ride alone without Aaron. After 1900 miles together, the sun casted long\
  \ the lines of the road and presented good company. Awaiting the ferry to the San\
  \ Juan Island, I thought of the night previous. Ian, the smokejumper from the UK,\
  \ I met in historic downtown Anacortes. Then, meeting his friend Jess, it was a\
  \ hell of a first night alone. I thought of the two of them as I sat there waiting,\
  \ as the brine of the sea carried itself over the buildings before me and recalled\
  \ pictures of home in my head. Boarding the ferry, with the sea rocking lightly\
  \ beneath, was a first for this bike and I. Kill the power and shut off the gas,\
  \ that voice came back. \n\n\"There is something to say about everywhere a motorcycle\
  \ has gone.\" Aaron's tone reflected the rocking and calmness of the sea beneath;\
  \ a natural rhythm found on the road with man and machine.\n \n    Arriving in Friday\
  \ Harbor, the main port, presented chaos. The vehicles flooded off of the ferry\
  \ and into town. Finding a spot to park, I went walked in to the Cask and Schooner\
  \ and met up with Ian and his fianc\xE9e Julie. The conversation was all explorative\
  \ conversations on the subjects of beer, love and beyond. Yet, the conversation\
  \ truly began at a pebbly beach on the west side. \n    We woke Ian up from an immediate\
  \ hammock nap out of the car and went to the beach. The day was clear, as the sun\
  \ was about to set, and the trees of the coast breathed out something clear to breathe\
  \ in. Julie and I sat on driftwood, talked of Ian's nuanced spirit, and just then\
  \ Ian jumped in that cold north pacific. I looked to him, stripped down and dove\
  \ in. Arising from the shock, we looked at each other, laughed and embraced. \n\
  \    Ashore, as I watched the beach bugs crawl over Ian's body, I wondered how he\
  \ felt relaxed. As I asked, he responded.\n\n\"Never swat at anything crawling on\
  \ your body until after you have identified it,\" Ian reciprocated. A definite trick\
  \ learned while in the special forces I was sure. Peering back over, he was pouring\
  \ pebbles atop his wet body. \n\n\"Why?\" I asked.\n\n\"Rocks, retaining heat, can\
  \ be used in dire situations to return warmth to the body.\"\n\n    The rest of\
  \ the night, a blur, one fights to remember. Returning on the ferry, with strangers\
  \ now family, wisdom echoed. Anacortes, the beautiful bookends for time spent. For\
  \ the darkest days and brightest nights of San Juan now faded and the road called."
