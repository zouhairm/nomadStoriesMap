Text: "Have you ever seen the glistening despair in the eyes of a child whose silent\
  \ outcry to humanity left you confused about who you were and what place you held\
  \ in the world?  \n\nMy alarm rang out in the starry night at a prompt 5:30 am.\
  \ I sat up, hanging my legs off either side of the hammock, taking care not to stir\
  \ up the sand that slept two feet beneath me. The Milky Way was shining bright,\
  \ in all its glowy-foggy wonder, as I began to stuff my Caribbean-soaked towel and\
  \ swimsuit in my backpack. It was time to leave paradise on earth and truck across\
  \ the La Guajira desert to the northernmost point of South America. \n\nWe piled\
  \ into a beat up 4x4. The gentle window breeze was salty and sandy, but refreshing,\
  \ and the light of the morning sun hitting my left shoulder sent a wave of goosebumps\
  \ down my spine. The desert landscape stretched for miles in every direction. \u201C\
  How do the drivers even know where they are going?\u201D I thought.\n\nFar off in\
  \ the distance were speckled dots, and they appeared to be moving, or was that just\
  \ us? Then it became clear. It was a little girl, no more than seven years old,\
  \ riding her dusty bike behind a small herd of white and brown goats. \u201CWhere\
  \ did she come from and where was she going?\u201D I wondered, as our jeep windows\
  \ received harsh blasts of sand that sounded like a calming hailstorm on a tin roof\
  \ during a sleepless night. \n\nI jutted forward. Blaring its horn, the jeep ahead\
  \ of us rolled slowly past what our driver exclaimed jokingly as a \u2018homemade\
  \ checkpoint.\u2019 Like a mob of meerkats, we all stretched out our necks to see\
  \ the hold up. \n\nThere, just on the other side of the tinted window, shyly waved\
  \ a half-naked toddler whose big brother firmly clutched his prize in the wrinkled\
  \ palm of his hand: a blood red lollipop. \n\n\u201COohs and awws\u201D and sickly\
  \ sweet smiles of adoration filled the car, poisoning me as we passed not one checkpoint,\
  \ but dozens. Row after row, children guarded their posts in order to receive a\
  \ piece of candy, fruit, or water pouch in exchange for passage. What was pocket\
  \ change for us, meant life or death for their families. \n\nA small boy hurtled\
  \ down the hill towards us, running as fast as his bare feet could manage across\
  \ the searing, cracked earth. But he was simply too late. He fell, lifting his head\
  \ in defeat; just in time to see a car full of foreign humanitarian students cruise\
  \ away. \n\nWith his arm outstretched toward the heavens, his desperate outcry was\
  \ left unheard and our humanity left unfettered."
