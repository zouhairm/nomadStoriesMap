Text: "I now understand the particular way people\u2019s faces light up when they\
  \ talk about visiting Japan. I never used to like furry clothing or fluffy and shiny\
  \ accessories until I saw how cool people could make it look. Beautiful store displays\
  \ and Japanese gardens unexpectedly inspired me. My love for Japanese food, born\
  \ across the sea in abstraction from the place itself, was fully satisfied as I\
  \ realised just how good it could be. Tokyo in particular captured my imagination.\
  \ The Shinjuku district proved to be where I saw some of the less shiny parts of\
  \ Japan. It was in a tiny bar, in the labyrinth alleys of Golden Gai that I manged\
  \ to find myself in the company of fellow solo travellers just as keen to explore\
  \ Tokyo\u2019s nightlife. It quickly became clear that we had a compatible sense\
  \ of fun and the tiny bar soon became a regular group venue for the evening. We\
  \ often joked about the number of love hotels in the area and laughed at how it\
  \ might be a funny pick up line. Little did I expect to find myself at the end of\
  \ an evening saying \u201Chave you ever been to a love hotel?\u201D Innocently,\
  \ the two of us set off in search. The appropriate etiquette for these situations\
  \ beyond us and the language proving a challenge. When we finally came across a\
  \ love hotel with availability, we followed the instructions to our designated number\
  \ and nervously opened the door. There was another door, we stepped inside and made\
  \ the worst decision one could in this kind of situation, we shut the door to the\
  \ hallway. We were faced only with an ATM, we shrugged and tried to navigate the\
  \ machine with little luck. Oddly the adjacent door was open, yet when we tried\
  \ the door to the hallway it was very locked. We were faced only with a tiny room\
  \ dominated by a bed decked out in floral. Needless to say, the bed was the last\
  \ thing on our mind. We tried the door, we pressed any cancel button we could on\
  \ the ATM and laughed in a manic way because it felt a little too much like a scene\
  \ from Saw. I didn\u2019t think it could get worse, and then an old fashioned floral\
  \ phone near the bed rang. We froze. I picked it up and tried to explain that we\
  \ wanted to leave, please. They spoke in Japanese. The line died. We panicked. We\
  \ heard a light knock on the door and bolted over as it was unlocked. Our saviour\
  \ was a woman in a gas mask wearing chemical grade rubber gloves. We apologised\
  \ profusely already half running down the corridor out into the dark streets where\
  \ we broke into relieved, hysterical laughter."
