Text: "As 19th century European colonizers died trying to get to this mystical place,\
  \ I had just picked a random destination by looking at the travel guides displayed\
  \ at the corner bookstore. As a white girl growing up in the suburbs of Montreal,\
  \ I had have a relatively comfortable life. I was part of a generation that reaped\
  \ the benefits of the women\u2019s liberation movement, freeing us from rigid patriarchal\
  \ religious duties. \n\nAs I was preparing to leave, three of my girlfriends decided\
  \ to join. I thought I was well travelled but nothing had prepared me for the culture\
  \ shock I experienced when I landed foot on African soil. Dakar was brutal. Most\
  \ streets were made of sand and buzzing with people. As women were transporting\
  \ baskets on their heads alongside graffiti covered abandoned looking buildings,\
  \ the city was hot as an oven and there was definitely no restaurants or convenient\
  \ stores I could recognize. \n\nI had no idea how we would survive the trip to Timbuktu,\
  \ around 1500 miles away from Dakar. \n\nWithin 24 hours, we had been offered Kola\
  \ nuts in a wedding celebration where the newlyweds appeared to be in France, we\
  \ had been eating on the floor with our bare hands from a plate we shared with at\
  \ least five other people and had gotten water from a well to wash our clothes.\
  \ \n\nDetermined to move forward, my friends got train tickets didn\u2019t know\
  \ didn\u2019t include seats and here we were piling our backpacks in what we thought\
  \ was a closet but turned out to be a toilet, and took turns to sit on top of them.\
  \ On that ride, I shed tears in silence and started to wonder why I had spent all\
  \ my savings to endure such hardship. \n\nBamako was kind to us though. We had found\
  \ refuge at a nun\u2019s convent and met a very charming young man that had offered\
  \ to take us to some of his relatives in Timbuktu. I was amazed by the frequent\
  \ stops made to allow people to attend to their spiritual values. It took us three\
  \ days to arrive to our final destination. Hungry, tired and dirty, we helped our\
  \ tour guide\u2019s family prepare a very special meal made of desert algae and\
  \ hand rolled noodles. When the night came, we\u2019d set up our blankets on the\
  \ roof and fell asleep under the stars. \n\nOur adventure was far from being over\
  \ but Timbuktu had been the symbol of our independence. We\u2019d lost weight but\
  \ had become grown women, we had no mirrors but could better see our strength. Our\
  \ friendship had grown in the face of adversity and in the end, it all made sense."
