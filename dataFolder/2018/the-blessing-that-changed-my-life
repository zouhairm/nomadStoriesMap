Text: "On my way back from the grand Golden temple of Amritsar in India, I look around\
  \ to see bazaars full of people from all over the world. Articles were hanging outside\
  \ the shops to invite the guests in. The place was a chaos. I notice a woman from\
  \ some European country trying to explain to a shopkeeper what she wants in a really\
  \ loud tone. A dog comes limping towards me and waits to take a sniff. Suddenly,\
  \ I can hear an old, shaky voice saying \u2018Rupees 10 for 2\u2019 repeatedly.\
  \ I turn around to see a frail body, with just enough clothes to cover the essentials,\
  \ carrying a bag full of pens. He\u2019s wearing a cloth of saffron colour- the\
  \ colour of India.\n\nI see him approach several people with a ray of hope in his\
  \ eyes, only to be pushed away. After all, who needs pens on a visit to one of the\
  \ most auspicious temples in India? But the old man, almost reaching his age of\
  \ senility, does not look like the one who gives up. He goes to each person walking\
  \ or standing on the pavement, in the hopes that maybe today, he could sleep with\
  \ his stomach full.\n\nFor a minute, I look around to find my mother; she was busy\
  \ bargaining for a cloth inside a shop. Fumbling inside my wallet, I check to see\
  \ if I had any money. I didn\u2019t. So, I jog over to my maa (mother) and ask her\
  \ for a 50 Rupee note. Busy in her shopping, she hurriedly hands the note to me\
  \ and resumes talking to the shopkeeper. I run back onto the pavement to look for\
  \ the old man again. Fixing my gaze upon him once more, I see that he\u2019s trying\
  \ to sell the pen to some foreigners now. \u2018Baba\u2019, I call out to him. The\
  \ next second, he looks towards my direction with a sparkle in his eye.\nI push\
  \ past several strangers to reach him, and when I do, I can see the glisten in his\
  \ eyes.\n\n\u201CHere, you can have this\u201D, I hand over the 50 Rupee note. With\
  \ a smile on his face, he starts counting a number of pens to hand them over to\
  \ me. \u201CI only want two. You can keep the rest of the change\u201D. I\u2019\
  d be lying if I said I\u2019ve seen other faces light up the way his did when those\
  \ words left my mouth. \nThe pens were in my hand now, and just as I was starting\
  \ to turn, with his voice losing its volume, he said, \u2018Since I\u2019ve lost\
  \ her, I haven\u2019t had a nice cup of tea. I don\u2019t really know how to make\
  \ tea like her. I have no one else. I just wish God had taken me instead of her.\u201D\
  \nAnd with that, he turned away.\n\n\u201CGod bless you, baccha (child)\u201D, he\
  \ said while walking away.\nOut of all the blessings I\u2019ve ever received, this\
  \ one means the most to me."
