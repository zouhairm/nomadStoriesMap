Text: "I stared him down defiantly, ensuring that he saw me; not hiding behind some\
  \ \u201CV for Vendetta\u201D mask like him. So what if there were no Court orderlies\
  \ here in the middle of this slowly reviving street? I didn\u2019t need any judge\
  \ reprimanding him for his insolent glares and menacing gestures towards me from\
  \ the dock. Admittedly, I wasn\u2019t local: \u201C\u2026not a Belonger\u2026\u201D\
  \ I think was the regular expression always deployed as if it were an insult. As\
  \ an itinerant prosecutor, I had only been here for about seven months, on this\
  \ chain of mounded, verdant islands fringed by shallow reefs and crystal-clear,\
  \ azure waters. Regardless, I came from hardier Caribbean stock, and didn\u2019\
  t scare easily. He hadn\u2019t scared me during the preliminary hearing. He hadn\u2019\
  t scared me during the opening speech before the Jury. He hadn\u2019t scared me\
  \ despite his hideous, smirking face reducing my star witness: his ex-girlfriend:\
  \ to a hyperventilating, crying mess on the stand. And he certainly hadn\u2019t\
  \ scared me during my brutal cross-examination of him, after he had cockily opted\
  \ to give evidence in his rape trial. In fact, my merciless demolition of his defence\
  \ that the encounter had been \u2018consensual\u2019 had transformed him into a\
  \ shouting buffoon, only restrained by the threat of a citation for contempt of\
  \ court. Naturally, I had ignored him, like most of the other criminals I had encountered\
  \ before. I had noted his person long enough, though, to immediately recognize him\
  \ seething at me astride an ATV he had obviously looted from the rental place out\
  \ east. But with the prison as badly damaged as the rest of this island was after\
  \ the worst Atlantic hurricane on record and with inmates running amuck, perhaps\
  \ he was thinking that I must be vulnerable now; unprotected by the Court, the robe\
  \ and the Police. Poor fool! Unforeseen as this turn of events was, I calmly stepped\
  \ out of my vehicle, letting him see the machete grasped in my hand; letting him\
  \ see my uncovered face; letting him see that, with only downed light poles, twisted\
  \ zinc sheets and torn up trees separating us on this roadway, he still did not\
  \ scare me. \n\nI stared him down, and as our two worlds collided in that lane-wide\
  \ space, the end of the world came early."
