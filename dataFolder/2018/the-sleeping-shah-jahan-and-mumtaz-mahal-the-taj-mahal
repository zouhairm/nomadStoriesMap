Text: "This past month I travelled to India with ITEC, or the Indian Technical and\
  \ Economic Cooperation. With less income and with children it is not possible for\
  \ me to travel whenever and wherever. Travelling was my dream since my childhood.\
  \ In my country the culture regarding women and girls is very strict. I mean travelling\
  \ is not for girls or women but I tried to find some ways of travelling, for example\
  \ studying. This time it was a chance to travel with ITEC scholarship program. Before\
  \ my trip to India I planned to travel Agra, Taj Mahal. I was lucky because my host\
  \ institute organized a sightseeing tour for its participants. \nOur tour guide\
  \ always gathered us in crowds of tourists with a \u201Cyes please!\u201D I could\
  \ find him with his so polite and loud \u201Cyes please.\u201D Alas, we came to\
  \ Taj Mahal.  Yes please, and our guide continued telling us interesting history\
  \ and facts of the marble mausoleum. Finally, we got into the mausoleum. I knew\
  \ that there was a sarcophagus of the emperor Shah Jahan and his lovely wife Mumtaz\
  \ Mahal but I never pictured that workers would be there, keeping silence and security,\
  \ maintaining discipline around the tombs in the main chamber. They always asked\
  \ us tourists to keep silent and showed us the sparkling reflection with the light\
  \ decorative elements of the tomb sometimes making echoes.  The Emperor\u2019s tomb\
  \ was surrounded by an open marble lattice and decorated with precious stones. Our\
  \ guide told about one of the most interesting sides of mausoleum: when you make\
  \ sound the acoustics last 16 seconds, creating a multiple echo.  It seemed that\
  \ it was not a grave. Here something fantastic and sacred happened. I imagined that\
  \ I was lost in this emperor and his wife\u2019s time period and in the royal bedroom,\
  \ the emperor and his wife were sleeping. It seemed that these guys were emperor\
  \ and his wife\u2019s bodyguards, keeping their sweet sleep. We silently went out\
  \ of the tomb one after another. Suddenly, I was back in real life. I tried to enter\
  \ the tomb again in order to have fantastic feelings that I had previously.  Yes\
  \ please, the guide exclaimed and it was it is time to leave the Taj Mahal.  I was\
  \ a little sad but I promised myself that I will be sure to come back and to have\
  \ the same feelings."
