Text: "It had been a year of on-going negotiations with the mind to accommodate just\
  \ an ounce of what was my happiness. The brain had grown malnourished of the fruitless\
  \ darkness that hung over her. \nSurrounded by a sea of hills blanketed in golden\
  \ sand, I stood awed by this workmanship. It had to have been my foreign foot prints\
  \ in the Namibian sands that cued a greeting of warm embrace from the velvet of\
  \ the desert. Cajoled by the silk touches of the dunes, my toes curled into the\
  \ embrace. My arms hugged by the gentle brushing of the wind, my skin kissed by\
  \ the rays of the sun, I felt life slowly dragging itself back inside of my soul.\
  \   Not a sight of man-made construction, completely enclosed in just the work of\
  \ God\u2019s hands. This had to be a partial reflection of heaven.\n\u201CLie down!\u201D\
  \ puzzled by this distant accented murmur my day dream fled. \u201CLie down?\u201D\
  \ I asked. \u201CIt\u2019s your turn, lie down.\u201D I lay my body down on the\
  \ hard board and clasped on to the edges just as the instructor had said. My face\
  \ so near to the floors of the carpeted dunes, I could almost hear the sands whisper\
  \ \u2018it\u2019s going to be alright.\u2019 God had to have been speaking to me.\n\
  Reassured I pinched my eyes closed, loosened the grip of my feet to the ground and\
  \ crossed the edge. Sailing down the hills I could feel the fiery sun tingle through\
  \ my protective gear. The currents of wind washed over me, cooling the burn of the\
  \ sun like how mom would when she fed me porridge. It was as though they had heard\
  \ my thoughts. \nAs I gradually came to a halt I let out a cry. Remembering that\
  \ I was no longer alone my eye lids parted as I entered back into reality. Hurriedly\
  \ I stood up from the board and looked back from I had come. In that very moment\
  \ I felt freed of burden. It was as though the sun had scorched my troubles away\
  \ and buried them in the millions of granules this ocean of sand. \nMy barely alive\
  \ happiness pushed me on the quest to get life back. \nAs we journeyed back to the\
  \ washed out, barely white kombi that somehow fitted into the aesthetics of the\
  \ dessert I smiled. With every step that imprinted in the sand, the sand swallowed\
  \ leaving almost no trace of my existence.   \nComing to Namibia my spirit had been\
  \ shadowed by a dark cloud. As we sat in the sun I could feel the sun light devour\
  \ all the darkness that had hovered over me.  I buried my troubles in the sandy\
  \ planes of Namibia. The emaciated state of my happiness begged for me to seek joy\
  \ for life once more. \nShe had chosen life once again\u2026"
