Text: "Previously when I decided to travel I could leave as fast as my fingers could\
  \ book a plane ticket. It was easy and unencumbered. These days the story is very\
  \ different, now I am the Mum of a toddler and this changes how you travel. My two-year-old\
  \ daughter, Miss R, thinks running is for fun, and is very sure she is a girl. I\
  \ arranged a family trip to Rings Beach, located near the northern tip of the Coromandel\
  \ peninsula. A four-hour drive would have our feet in the sand, worth every minute\
  \ to experience the beauty of this scenic reserve. To \u2018toddler travel\u2019\
  \ I have adapted. The new style I\u2019m embracing is called \u2018slow down Mama\u2019\
  , it\u2019s challenging. Toddler time isn't hours and minutes it\u2019s time-spent\
  \ teaching and playing. \nDeparture day arrives and Miss R is up early gushing toddler\
  \ talk. Unlike my trips B.C. (before child) preparation is required for toddler\
  \ adventures. Even a short distance off the beaten track requires a first-aid kit,\
  \ toddlers are accident-prone. The car loaded, six bags and a pram, the only thing\
  \ left is to buckle in. Mercifully Miss R likes being in the car. She is happy playing\
  \ with her toys and an hour in she falls asleep. I revel in a well-earned silence,\
  \ arriving at The Long Table Caf\xE9, where Mum is waiting. This picturesque caf\xE9\
  \ is welcoming to all, the food is sumptuous, and Mama\u2019s milk, coffee, is a\
  \ fine pour. Continuing on to Rings the road is meandering. We arrive in time for\
  \ wave splashing. Cool water with warm spring tentacles weaves around our toes.\
  \ The deserted beach is calming and quintessential New Zealand. The perfect place\
  \ to slow down and breathe the salt-filled air. With the tide rising and the sun\
  \ setting we get our dinner preparations underway. Miss R joins us in pre-dinner\
  \ indulgences like blue cheese. As the night draws in we hear the waves polishing\
  \ the sand, creating a peaceful ambiance. High on holiday excitement eventually\
  \ tiredness overcomes exhilaration and Miss R sleeps. Mum and I get some adult time\
  \ and holiday mode settles over us. \nFootprints of early walkers litter the morning\
  \ beach as our sandcastle building ensues. When our tummies rumble we drive to the\
  \ village of Kuaotunu, the hub being Luke\u2019s Kitchen. Delicious food is consumed\
  \ before we go to the park. Youthful exuberance envelops us. The last thing I expected\
  \ while holidaying with a toddler is how relentless it is, but I love introducing\
  \ Miss R to the thrill of travel. This area provides that in spades, even if they\
  \ are sandcastle digging ones."
