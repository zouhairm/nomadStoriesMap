Text: "She is clearly the boss. The only female amongst bustling men, she stands with\
  \ her feet wide and firmly planted on the ground. She is so slender, small and soft-spoken,\
  \ and yet exudes authority. Even in her ultra casual baggy t-shirt and flip flops.\n\
  *\n\u201CLet\u2019s try here,\u201D my fellow backpacker leads the way to a shop\
  \ that looks just like the rest of the shops lining wide and dusty Chomphon Street.\
  \ It\u2019s a storage-unit like building with a concrete floor and garage door front.\
  \ \n\nI am in Tak, the capital town of Tak Province in Thailand, and on a mission\
  \ to rent motorbikes. Not a motorcycle taxi, as people keep interpreting. We each\
  \ want a bike, to drive ourselves. Though I do not admit it to my fearless firefighter\
  \ friend, I\u2019m terrified of this task, having only just earned my driver\u2019\
  s license back home in Canada. But this is my first time traveling solo; I\u2019\
  m determined to prove myself.\n\nAnd that\u2019s when I meet her \u2013 Pui (pronounced\
  \ like boy), a Thai woman who greets us with a big smile and lots of questions.\
  \ Who are we, where are we from? Her English is great and we instantly hit it off.\n\
  \nShe\u2019s maybe in her 30s and she owns this ice-selling business.\n\nThere isn\u2019\
  t anywhere to rent bikes in Tak, Pui says, but, (and this is within minutes of meeting\
  \ us), we can borrow one of hers. We can park it at our guest house overnight and\
  \ return it tomorrow. \n\nShe is clearly practiced at trusting her own judgement.\
  \ (Good judgment at that, noting she\u2019s offered us just one bike\u2026 meaning\
  \ I won\u2019t be driving). \n\n \u201CKhaawp-khun-kaa,\u201D with my hands together\
  \ in prayer, I bend my torso into a deep bow. Thank you.\n*\n\u201CI\u2019ll take\
  \ you to get a hotel.\u201D Pui tries to pick up my huge backpack but immediately\
  \ starts laughing. She can\u2019t even get it off the ground. She motions to one\
  \ of her staff to load it into the trunk of her sporty white Honda.\n\n\"You hungry?\"\
  \n\nYep.\n\n\"You like Pad Thai?\"\n\nYep.\n\n\"Only 10 baht for Pad Thai, very\
  \ cheap.\" \n\nNo kidding, that\u2019s 40 cents.\n\n\u201CFirst we get hotel, then\
  \ eat. I take care of friend when they come to visit me because when I go out of\
  \ province, my friends take care of me too.\u201D\n*\nIt\u2019s supposed to be my\
  \ last day in Tak. Pui hadn\u2019t been there earlier when we\u2019d returned her\
  \ motorbike, so I am simply stopping at the ice shop on my way out of town, to thank\
  \ her again.\n\n\u201CNo,\u201D she\u2019d said simply. \"Tonight is start of Loi\
  \ Kratong festival. Very special in Tak. You stay and celebrate with me and my family.\"\
  \ \n\nStay? How could I possibly argue? After all, she\u2019s the boss."
