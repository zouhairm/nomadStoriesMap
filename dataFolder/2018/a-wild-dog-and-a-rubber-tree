Text: "I paced along the dusty street, trying to step around open drains and cracked,\
  \ uneven concrete. The road buzzed with rickshaws, trucks and motorbikes \u2013\
  \ some with entire families crammed onto the back. Life in Kerala was colourful\
  \ chaos. Old women in bright saris swept their doorways with tiny, asymmetrical\
  \ brooms. Cows and goats wandered freely into traffic, bending to eat discarded\
  \ banana peels and coconut husks. Radios chattered in competition with the noise\
  \ of the street. \n\nI followed Chacko into a small shop to have tea. We\u2019d\
  \ met a few days before, and he was keen to show me the local sites. I drank my\
  \ ultra-sweet tea while he talked about his children. \n\n\u201CBefore we knew it\
  \ \u2013 he\u2019d cut down four trees!\u201D Chacko laughed uproariously, flashing\
  \ all his teeth. His son Samson was a handful; a boy around twelve, though no one\
  \ knew his age for certain.  \n\nSamson was shy and sweet, with a surprising streak\
  \ of naughtiness. He had a penchant for destroying things \u2013 including (unfortunately)\
  \ their neighbour\u2019s expensive rubber trees. Chacko had rescued and adopted\
  \ him some years earlier. One of many orphaned children in Kerala, Samson had been\
  \ exploited for labour \u2013 unbelievably, he\u2019d been made to look after herds\
  \ of huge buffalo. He had a long curved scar running across one cheek, but no memory\
  \ of how it had happened. Now he lived with Chacko and attended school with his\
  \ adopted brothers and sisters. \n\n\u201CThey were so angry. I just wish he\u2019\
  d chosen some different trees.\u201D Chacko at least, could see the funny side of\
  \ Samson\u2019s adventures.\n\nOver several days I heard more stories about Chacko\u2019\
  s life. His ambition was as boundless as his generosity; he\u2019d once owned nothing\
  \ but a blanket. Somehow he\u2019d managed to buy a large home for the children,\
  \ and even open a school. I sipped my tea, fascinated as he explained the lingering\
  \ effects of the caste system in India.\n\nHe\u2019d once rescued a baby boy from\
  \ the street \u2013 he believed no one would pick up the boy because of his dark\
  \ skin, and his therefore \u2018low status\u2019. All day the baby lay on the ground\
  \ in the burning sun, covered by a swarm of ants. A group of wild dogs gathered,\
  \ drawn by his helpless vulnerability. But a single female dog stood over him, snarling\
  \ and growling ferociously, protecting him until help arrived. Now a healthy child\
  \ around eight, he had a life and a future.\n\nWe stayed in Kerala for three weeks,\
  \ but I\u2019ll remember Chacko\u2019s stories and the taste of sweet, syrupy tea\
  \ for the rest of my life."
