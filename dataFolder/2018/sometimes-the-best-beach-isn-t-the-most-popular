Text: "When planning our trip to Boavista island we were undecided where to book our\
  \ acommodation. Near the city where the beach wasn't so good or far way from Sal.Rei\
  \ in Praia de Chaves where is said beach is the best and where big resorts are settled.\
  \ Finally we decided to stay at Sal Rei near Estoril beach in a walking distance\
  \ from the city center and if we wanted we would take a coletivo to go to Chaves\
  \ Beach. When we arrived there weren't lot of expectations. Although the water was\
  \ amazing everywhere we go there were some rocks, by the morning there was almost\
  \ anyone on the beach, dogs walk freely around and the sand wasn\u2019t as clean\
  \ as we are used to. But, on the afternoon people from Boavista start appearing,\
  \ little kids that grow up playing on the water, people who came to the beach after\
  \ a work day just to seat on the sand and stare at the water or ever clean up their\
  \ clothes and take their shower (since around there water is a precious resource)\
  \ and older kids also came with skim boards to have fun and try to show their feats\
  \ to friends.\nChaves beach was a little bit far like 7km and on our second day\
  \ we decided to go there and then walk back by the water line. The beach was really\
  \ amazing, desert, cleaner with big waves. We reached a well known resort where\
  \ a friend had to use the bathroom. While I was waiting I sat on a sun lounger and\
  \ watched for a moment. Lots of sun loungers very well arranged with lots of white\
  \ people or should I say red people due to their big sun burns caused by so many\
  \ hours at the sun that make them seem like lobsters. People go there and try to\
  \ get as tanned as they can and I believe that they almost don\u2019t leave the\
  \ hotel. I realize that definitely we had made the right decision, that really wasn't\
  \ my beach.\nThat place wasn't Boavista anymore, just a bunch of tourist that don't\
  \ leave the hotel and don't care to know how cape verdian life really is. In that\
  \ moment I missed every single detail of Estoril beach, the mixture of people, the\
  \ daily life, the people that came to us just to have a conversation and try to\
  \ know us and the kids having fun. Sure, Chaves is amazing and the next day we visit\
  \ the fabulous Santa Monica and Varandinha beaches but for me nothing is better\
  \ than real and genuine Estoril. I think I will carry the memories of all moments\
  \ in that beach on my heart forever."
