Text: "I travelled to Saudi Arabia in 2016 to learn about corals in the Red Sea. The\
  \ water was 48 degrees Celius and so salty that it burnt the skin slightly and made\
  \ you feel soft. I lept from the boat hoping to escape the dry desert heat. The\
  \ water was 2 degrees warmer than the air and I began to sweat under the water,\
  \ one of the strangest sensations. But there was a thriving reef and an array of\
  \ colourful corals surviving in conditions that would cause bleaching in any other\
  \ region of the world. \n\nBut this story is not about that, it's about Victoria\
  \ secret and Pokemon go. \n\nBefore I left for my travels, I had received a lot\
  \ of strange warnings from friends and family. I come from a small town in \"the\
  \ hills\". This description works in Perth, because the landscape is so flat. There\
  \ is only one hill. People also say, \"keep going until you get to the tunnel\"\
  , for example, because there is only one tunnel, you do not need to specify which\
  \ one.\n\nMy friend tried to convince me not to go, I asked why, she said \"you\
  \ need seven male witnesses in Saudi to report a sexual offence....\"\nThis fact\
  \ was not true.\nPeople also told me that you cannot wear colour, dance or play\
  \ Pokemon, because they were all band by the King for wasting time. \nI found out\
  \ some of this was true, but chess is also banned and people still play if they\
  \ really want to. \nWhen I went to the mall in Jeddah, I saw it was the same in\
  \ many ways to Perth, but they had better brands. American brands like Taco Bell\
  \ and Pottery Barn. \n\nEverywhere I looked, I saw someone playing Pokemon go. I\
  \ saw Victoria Secret stores with\nWomen happily browsing beautifil laungerie. \n\
  Everyone was minding their own business. \nI can't say the same for my home town,\
  \ but now I care a lot less what people back home have to say."
