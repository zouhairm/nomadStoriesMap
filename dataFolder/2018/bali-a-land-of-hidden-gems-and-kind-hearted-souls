Text: "Bali is definitely a tropical paradise! A heavenly abode for the beach bums,the\
  \ nature lovers,the historical junkies as well as the party mongers!\nBali is a\
  \ place for all kind of people! The moment we stepped into the Land of Bali, we\
  \ couldn\u2019t help but fall in love with it!\nHere I present to you the 2 best\
  \ Things that me and my husband loved about this paradise!!\n\n1. The people\nI\
  \ have never ever met such kind,welcoming and pure hearted souls ever. Right from\
  \ the driver, to the persons selling coconuts or souvenirs, they all have this big\
  \ smile always on their faces. They always ask about where you come from, where\
  \ are you staying. Hope you are enjoying your holiday. How wonderful it is when\
  \ someone cares so much! And their welcoming hearts are so pure and selfless, they\
  \ wont even force you to buy anything if you don\u2019t really feel like.We had\
  \ 2 such wonderful experiences of the kind-hearted people, one of the local stores\
  \ didn\u2019t have the exact change to give back to us, so that person took 5,000\
  \ IDR less from us and said no problem,now how sweet is that!The second incidence\
  \ just stole our hearts completely. While we were at the toll, we got to know that\
  \ they don\u2019t accept cash and only the local transport card can be swiped, so\
  \ we requested a local person to swipe it for us and we would pay him in cash. The\
  \ toll was 5,000 IDR and we had 10,000 IDR, which we handed over to him. Unfortunately,\
  \ he didnt have the change and without any hesitation or asking can you ask further,\
  \ he said no problem, just keep it and went away! We were totally swept away by\
  \ that golden act of his! Now this what Bali is all about:golden hearted souls!\n\
  \n2. The Delicious cuisine\nIf you have ever been to Bali and not tried Babi Guling\
  \ and Bebek Betutu, you havent really enjoyed Bali (if you are a Non-veggie of course)!!\n\
  \nThe Nasi Goreng is a world-famous dish and its absolutely delicious to the core\
  \ and definitely cant be missed! I must have had this at least 5 times in our entire\
  \ trip!\n\nNasi Ayam, Mie Goreng are other local dishes to try. Nasi ayam and Nasi\
  \ campur can be found served at many warungs (small local eateries) and restaurants\
  \ throughout the island.This is usually the delight of every foreigner on the island!\n\
  You can end your lunch/dinner with a lip-smacking local dessert \u2013Black rice\
  \ pudding.Yummmm isn\u2019t it?!\n\nThese are just the top 2 things we loved!so\
  \ many more to go! Its truly a mystical land of beaches,waterfalls,temples and lip-smacking\
  \ food that satiates your hunger!!"
