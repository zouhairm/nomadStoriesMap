Text: "Sewing and writing are similar. They both require patience, discipline and\
  \ spending hours sitting. The activity depends on other objects: a needle, thread,\
  \ and cloth; a pencil and a sheet. Both things are simple, but require looking at\
  \ details.\n\nI think about all that while I walk in Santo Domingo\u2019s park,\
  \ a small town in Colombia, where in the middle of the 19th century my favorite\
  \ writer was born: Tom\xE1s Carrasquilla. A man who dedicated his life to sewing\
  \ and writing.\n\nI know there\u2019s a museum in his honor here, that's why when\
  \ I see a wooden advertisement that read: \u201CFruits of My Land\" I head down\
  \ enthusiastically, because that's the name of one of his novels. I don\u2019t need\
  \ to enter to realize that it\u2019s not the museum. It\u2019s a place where they\
  \ sell fruits. There is a child sitting at the door, drinking juice and I ask him:\n\
  \u2014Hello. Could you tell me where the Tom\xE1s Carrasquilla House Museum is?\n\
  \u2014One street below \u2014. He tells me.\n\nUpon entering, I find some photos;\
  \ I look carefully at his manuscripts enclosed in crystals. A guide shows me the\
  \ whole place and tells me that Tom\xE1s tried to study at the university but he\
  \ was not doing very well. The principal of the time in his reports wrote: \"The\
  \ constant reading of novels has harmed the student a lot,\" not knowing that Carrasquilla\
  \ would be the first professional Colombian writer ever, and would influence in\
  \ a decisive way the Colombian culture. Even the Nobel Prize winner Garc\xEDa M\xE1\
  rquez was inspired by him.\n\nDue to a civil war at the beginning of the 20th century,\
  \ Tom\xE1s had to stop studying and became a tailor but he never stopped writing.\
  \ He even sold his books outside this very house.\n\u2014This was his favorite place.\
  \ \u2014the guide tells me, showing me a window that overlooks the park.\nI lay\
  \ my hand at his tailor's table and look out the window. I see men with hats in\
  \ the plaza, drinking coffee; women who hang their clothes to sell; a boy herding\
  \ two small cows. Everything is familiar to me, Tom\xE1s wrote about all those people.\n\
  \nI go to the place called \"Fruits of my land\". I buy a salad prepared with fruits\
  \ of the region. I sit to eat it. The mountains cover the entire landscape and are\
  \ lost beyond my eyes. I feel small, as if I were a fictional character. If that\
  \ were the case, I would like Tom\xE1s Carrasquilla to write about me, because he\
  \ knew how to capture with humility and simplicity the human soul. He knew that\
  \ sewing and writing are similar: they are things that only make sense if they are\
  \ made for others"
