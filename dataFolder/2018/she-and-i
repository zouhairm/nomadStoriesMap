Text: "\"She should be killed\" said a stranger. About me. On the internet. Four words\
  \ sitting next to a low-res photo of a smiling man's face. \n\n--\n\nTwo years earlier\
  \ I'm sitting on a small bus, turning around in my seat, laughing. Listening to\
  \ outlandish stories being traded by men much more well travelled than I. I've been\
  \ here, to this place, many more times than most. I'm shepherding them, these experts\
  \ of elsewhere.\n\nUp ahead, a small neat woman unfolds herself, turns to face us\
  \ and gracefully begins navigating the jolting movements of the bus. \n\nAs she\
  \ sits next to me, her tiny frame perches on the edge of our single seat and she\
  \ presses her body close. Her invasion of my space is a continuation of an ongoing\
  \ cultural indoctrination: a gentle but forceful steering grab of my elbow, the\
  \ playful pinching of my ample flesh.\n\nShe talks about shifting schedules and\
  \ newly available options, glancing back at our charges, these brave boys devouring\
  \ her country with their cameras.\n\nI know they want to see our circus, she says,\
  \ but the orchestra opportunity is really very rare.\n\nI look at her as she scans\
  \ the hurried notes sitting in her lap, and then I realise.\n\nIf I come to the\
  \ orchestra with you, would that work? I say, We can let the boys go with the driver?\n\
  \nShe smiles brightly, the rare opportunity is hers.\n\n--\n\nWe sit next to one\
  \ another in the concert hall and she turns to me, eager to take advantage of this\
  \ time without responsibilities, before the music starts.\n\nDon't you miss your\
  \ boyfriend when you're on tour? It's agony for me to be so long without my husband.\n\
  \nShe tells me they have accepted their infertility and have become so much closer\
  \ for it and talks about living with her in-laws. She is supposed to rise before\
  \ him, to prepare breakfast and be a dutiful wife, but sometimes he tells her to\
  \ rest. She's lucky she found a good man. She tells me once a year he gets blind\
  \ drunk. It's healthy, she says, it's important to be able to let go. \n\nAs the\
  \ light dims she squeezes my arm and tells me I am her best friend. \n\nWe're so\
  \ lucky, she says, we have worked together so many times.\n\n--\n\nOn a computer\
  \ screen two years later, underneath some photographs I've taken, four words stare\
  \ at out me and I feel slightly ill. \n\nI don't talk to my best friend about it.\
  \ I don't talk to her at all any more. Because I left my old job. And she lives\
  \ in North Korea."
