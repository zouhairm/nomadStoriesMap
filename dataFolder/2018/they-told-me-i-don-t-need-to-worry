Text: "One can tell Raglan, New Zealand is special by the way the locals proudly take\
  \ the hands of strangers and show them how to surf, how to farm and how to swim.\
  \ I stumbled upon the sleepy, salty town when I was 17, living out of a van with\
  \ total strangers, and hungry for some life lessons. \n \nThere were a few swollen\
  \ book shops, coffee shops and mostly surf shops lined up with wooden panels and\
  \ a thick layer of sand luring travellers to join the barefoot rebellion. \n\nAt\
  \ the edge of the stores I attempted to skate, eventually danced and finally stumbled\
  \ into his welcoming humbled patterned store to be greeted by a toothless smile\
  \ and quick, wrinkled handshake. \n\nThe store, Three Little Birds, emanated it\u2019\
  s magic properties. It was small, roughly the size of a simple bedroom and it was\
  \ absolutely brimmed with gems. Artists from all over New Zealand sold their jewelry,\
  \ old paintings and torn jackets in Tony\u2019s store and it was properly cluttered\
  \ with stunningly eccentric pieces that just so happened to match everyone's messiest\
  \ traveling uniforms. \n\nEveryday I would visit the store (it would take months\
  \ to look at each piece and give justice to its beauty), and everyday I fell in\
  \ love with Tony\u2019s unconditional adoration for his customers and his artwork.\
  \ \n\nOne day, in particular a green stone displayed in the corner of the store\
  \ called out to me. Having lived with Maori people, I had come to partly begin to\
  \ understand the indigenous cultures relationship with jewelry over the trip, and\
  \ thus finding a piece I loved was vital to my 17 year old self esteem.  Tony explained\
  \ to me that unfortunately it was not for sale. It was from a woman he had loved\
  \ and lost and wanted to keep it\u2019s beautiful energy around. I understood, of\
  \ course, but my fascination with the green necklace stuck with me, and what I couldn\u2019\
  t have I coveted more. \n\nSo my days turned from shopping, into coffee with Tony,\
  \ hearing stories about his travels and his favorite collections.\n\nI purchased\
  \ many things from that store, all from the same artist as the necklace that caught\
  \ my attention. I wore them all for the rest of my travels, in and out of my van.\
  \ And, when I did leave Raglan, Tony, an old gracious soul, held my young hand and\
  \ explained that he did believe one day I would find myself wearing the green necklace,\
  \ once his turn with the piece was over."
