Text: "I gaze at the massive spire of Christ Church Cathedral on Unguja Island, Zanzibar,\
  \ as it reaches apologetically towards cotton candy-like clouds that climb hopefully\
  \ into the brilliant azure sky.  \n\n\"Is it trying to escape the traumatic history\
  \ from which it rises in elegant dignity in memoriam, or invoke it?\"  I close my\
  \ eyes. Time slips away...\n\nIt's market day.  Women wearing bright-colored cloths\
  \ weave through throngs of waiting buyers with unimaginably large baskets of produce\
  \ on their heads.  Men eagerly set up stalls to sell anything, and everything, that\
  \ any of us might need.  Children scramble for spare change and forgotten treasures.\
  \  The air fills with voices fervently haggling over the price of one thing or another.\
  \  The heat of the sun, laced with a subtle hint of panic, is stifling, a harbinger\
  \ of what is to come.  Because today, along with spices and fabric, ivory and precious\
  \ metals, and a rainbow of mouth-watering fruits and vegetables, a very special\
  \ commodity is going up for auction - people.\n\nI hear the rattling of the chains\
  \ around their necks as they are lined up by size.  \"Whack!  Whack!\"  The stinging\
  \ sound of slapping against bare skin reverberates across the raw jumble of humanity\
  \ that stretches out before me.  I see the man, no more than a boy really, tied\
  \ to the central whipping post as a test of his courage.  I hear his cries as he,\
  \ to his owner's great disappointment, cannot contain his suffering.   His tears\
  \ scorch my cheeks as they fall from his eyes in shame.\n\n\"That one has no stamina!\u201D\
  \ declares a man standing next to me, shaking his head. \u201CHe certainly isn't\
  \ worth much to his owner now.\"   \n\nShrouded by the canopy of despair that haunts\
  \ this place, I quietly raise my hand and offer my last bars of salt to free his\
  \ soul.  Together we leave the world's last remaining, legally operating, open slave\
  \ market.\n\nThe sun casts a last long flickering light across the faces of the\
  \ five nameless slaves who wait solemnly outside the cathedral. Carved in stone\
  \ and linked as one with an iron chain that once enslaved their ancestors, they\
  \ stand in sacred silence without opprobrium, half-buried in a solitary cement pit\
  \ that recalls the human storage chambers beneath their feet.  As we look at one\
  \ another across time, I embrace, as residents of the island have, poignant memories\
  \ of our collective human heritage, the worst, and the best, because it was also\
  \ here where we finally brought the heart-rending African slave trade to its knees."
