Text: "On our second evening in Fez, Dana and I set out to find the restaurant Dar\
  \ Roumana in the city\u2019s old medina. According to reviews, this was one of the\
  \ best restaurants in town. We knew that we would never be able to find it on our\
  \ own in the medina\u2019s maze of narrow alleyways and were relieved when we were\
  \ approached by a group of boys who offered to guide us. The leader of the group,\
  \ Hamad, was full of bratty 11-year old confidence. He high fived us and we were\
  \ off. \n\nOn the way, Hamad tried to convince us to go to the restaurant where\
  \ his mother worked instead. \u201CNo Hamad, we go to Dar Roumana,\u201D I stood\
  \ firm.  We were walking past rows of tiny shops selling everything from toilet\
  \ seat covers to old records, when Hamad suddenly stopped, \u201CYou go right and\
  \ then left,\u201D he said, before running away. \n\nAbandoned, we backtracked until\
  \ we found two women taking their children for an evening walk. One of them pointed\
  \ to her teenage daughter and said, \u201CShe will take you.\u201D Unlike Hamad,\
  \ the girl was quiet and knew where she was going. She led us back an alley to a\
  \ wooden door with a small plaque next to it that read, \u201CDar Roumana.\u201D\
  \ \n\nDana and I rang the bell. No answer. The lights were off. There was no one\
  \ there but a few stray kittens on an unlit doorstep. Dar Roumana was closed, maybe\
  \ for good. \n\nHungry and tired, we walked to Rue Talaa Kebira, which was abuzz\
  \ with men selling eggs and Fez caps. Eventually, we stumbled upon a place called\
  \ Caf\xE9 Clock. The door was wide open. Handsome waiters led us to the terrace\
  \ where groups of smart young Moroccans drank almond milkshakes. The women at the\
  \ table next to us said hello. In the distance, a half moon hung over the emerald\
  \ green pyramid roof of Al Karaouin\u2013 the oldest university in the world. \n\
  \nDana and I stayed for a while after finishing dinner, enjoying the ambience that\
  \ we agreed was very pleasant in an intangible way. \n\nI think our trip to Dar\
  \ Roumana is analogous to life. Sometimes you\u2019re headed for the place that\
  \ got great reviews. You have multiple guides to lead you. Maybe you get confused\
  \ and distracted on the way but finally, you arrive! Great, except the lights are\
  \ off; the doors are locked. Thankfully, you don\u2019t give up. You keep wandering\
  \ until you arrive at the right but unplanned destination. Maybe you would\u2019\
  ve been better off if you had gone there straightaway but probably not. You had\
  \ to arrive exasperated from your search for the wrong place to know that you had\
  \ finally arrived at the right one."
