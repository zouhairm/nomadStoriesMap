Text: "It was 2014. I had just lost my mother and was seeking a time to myself. I\
  \ decided then to explore a new country. I noted that there was a place in South\
  \ America, my passion, not yet explored by me: Colombia. At first, thoughts about\
  \ guns and narcotraffic came into my mind, but it all disappeared as soon as I googled\
  \ some images. Colombia was wonderful! Without thinking much, I bought my tickets\
  \ to Bogot\xE1, around 20 days of unknown exploration to deal with, and an excitement\
  \ of going alone to somewhere without prior knowledge. In the days that followed,\
  \ I planned everything. Searched for places to visit and to stay. I rented a couple\
  \ of days of an airbnb apartment at Bogota and that was it. I was ready to go, with\
  \ my itinerary printed inside my backpack. The day before the flight, Camila, a\
  \ friend of mine I had known in a trip to Atacama desert, saw on my facebook timeline\
  \ that I was going to Bogota and she offered to present me a local colombian friend\
  \ of her, that with her words, \u201Chad a lot in common with me\u201D.  As soon\
  \ I accepted the invite we were already friends in facebook. Carlos, my new colombian\
  \ friend, insisted to pick me up on the airport at 5 a.m. The day had come and when\
  \ I get to Eldorado airport, there he was. With that unmistakable colombian smile\
  \ in his face, he took me to his apartment and offered me a typical colombian breakfast\
  \ with arepas, eggs and so. I told him about my plans and he got really excited\
  \ about my trip. His eyes shined while he offered me a real colombian trip by car\
  \ for about 15 days. He was studying modern languages at college and he could easily\
  \ take these free days out. As soon I said ok to him, I knew a great friendship\
  \ was born there. It undoubtedly was the best decision I could take. The days that\
  \ came was the most amazing days I have had in a long time. Together, we travel\
  \ almost 4 thousand miles by car inside the whole Colombia, going to places I never\
  \ knew existed, I met incredible people that made me think that Colombia was the\
  \ most friendly country in the world. We visit big cities like Medellin and Bucaramanga\
  \ besides Bogot\xE1, touristic cities as Cartagena and Santa Marta, little villages\
  \ like Barichara and Villa de Leyva besides paradisiac and isolated beaches at the\
  \ caribbean. I will never forget Colombia and Carlos\u2019 friendship. Since then,\
  \ I returned two more times and from a place that was nothing to me it became a\
  \ very special place to carry on with my heart and a friend for life. Viva Colombia!"
