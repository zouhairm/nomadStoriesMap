Text: "\u201CI\u2019m actually crying at an airport just like in the movies.\u201D\
  \nWith sighs, puffs of smoke, and emotions from completely opposing poles, I hardly\
  \ managed to finish my sentence. I was at the surprisingly spotless, almost hostilely\
  \ white, Noi Bai T2 Airport \u2013 quite a contrast to the quirky and colorful city\
  \ of Hanoi that marries culture and chaos all too well. With me then were 2 of the\
  \ closest girlfriends I made. One was blonde, the other was a brunette, and my Asian\
  \ hair had a reddish hue from the fading dye. We named our trio after some American\
  \ cartoon of superhero kindergartners.\nI took a long drag on my slim menthol cigarette\
  \ as I sat on the pavement, savoring those final moments of freedom. I let out smoke\
  \ and watched it dance with the bright fluorescent lights as I reminisced about\
  \ the 2 months that passed. I was buying more time. I didn\u2019t want to go yet.\
  \ Tears fell again without warning. The last thing I expected was to be a hot mess\
  \ on a 3-hour flight home from a trip I almost ended prematurely. I wiped my tears\
  \ and smiled with everything that I got; my metal mouth flashed as I stepped on\
  \ my dying stick. \nIt was a completely different story just a few weeks back. I\
  \ was doing my TEFL training as a first-time solo traveler abroad. I always knew\
  \ I wanted to see more of the world, so I started with that trip. But as my plane\
  \ took off for departure the night I embarked on my journey, it hit me; I was going\
  \ to be alone, away from home. I was having second thoughts. Maybe I didn\u2019\
  t really know what I wanted?\nBut time flew by. Yes, I stayed in a questionable\
  \ hostel for 2 months in a city as exotic as its language and lived a life my mother\
  \ almost certainly won\u2019t approve of. I hitched on motorbikes with drivers who\
  \ drove like we were on our way to hell on the bustling city streets and hustled\
  \ to make ends meet to have enough \u0111\u1ED3ng for egg coffees and museum visits.\
  \ But I also found a home there; I made a family of travelers, got my liquid courage\
  \ from $.25 bia h\u01A1i cups, said my Catholic prayers in pagodas and temples,\
  \ and even fell in love by the lakeside of H\u1ED3 Ho\xE0n Ki\u1EBFm. Then it dawned\
  \ on me, what I\u2019ve always wanted, and I was grateful.\n8 weeks later, all I\
  \ wanted was to stay; but I knew my lot that night. I looked at my watch as an almost\
  \ inaudible announcement in ti\u1EBFng vi\u1EC7t wafted through the air.\n\u201C\
  It\u2019s ok baby. Things will be ok.\u201D My friend said as she reached out to\
  \ me and squeezed me tightly.\n\u201COf course.\u201D I uttered as I made my way\
  \ to immigration."
