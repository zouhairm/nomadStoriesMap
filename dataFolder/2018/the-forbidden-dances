Text: "I held my breath and knocked on the door again, this time a little bit louder.\
  \ A young woman opened the door and it took me a few seconds to recognized her as\
  \ the lady I met at Isfahan\u2019s Grand Bazaar earlier today.\nIt was only a few\
  \ hours ago that I walking through the winding roads of the bazaar, admiring a whirlwind\
  \ of sounds, colours and smells. The clutter of silver kitchen utensils mixed with\
  \ the laughs of charming salesmen and bargaining customers, a fusion of smells from\
  \ the local spice stalls and a an array of colours, lights, fabrics and people sent\
  \ all my senses into a whirlwind of bliss. \nI met Leilah at her husband\u2019s\
  \ shop, where layers and layers of carpets with beautiful mosaic patterns lined\
  \ the floors and walls. I started a conversation with her and it was not long before\
  \ we were drinking tea, comfortably tucked away on cushions inside her shop, and\
  \ she invited me to join her for dinner. \nShe was wearing long, loose clothing\
  \ and a hijab this morning and was dressed in line with the Islamic dress code which\
  \ is legally enforced in Iran since the 1979 revolution. She now stood in front\
  \ of me in a knee-length dress and dark red lipstick, her beautiful long curls flowing\
  \ freely around her face. What a beauty Persian women are, I thought, feeling severely\
  \ underdressed and too conservative in my long, black clothing.  \n\nMy thankfulness\
  \ for Leilah\u2019s generosity turned into outright embarrassment as I walked through\
  \ her small flat and saw the meal for kings she had prepared; countless Persian\
  \ dishes covering the table with rice, meats and stews filled with saffron, fruits,\
  \ herbs, flowers and ground roots.\nMen and women were dressed in western clothing\
  \ flaunting shirts, dresses and high heels. The only woman wearing a hijab was an\
  \ elderly lady sitting at the table drinking tea. \n\nSuddenly loud Persian music\
  \ erupted and the crowd cheered as they began to dance, moving their bodies with\
  \ the rhythm in an epic trance, dancing their worries away like their hips are the\
  \ only things that do not lie. \nLeilah explained that dancing was banned in their\
  \ country and that this simply moved the activity to an illegal underground rave\
  \ scene and into the privacy of people's own homes. \nI nodded in silence at the\
  \ strange juxtaposition untangling itself in front of me, showcasing a country so\
  \ restricted in freedom where joie de vivre is deeply ingrained in the hearts of\
  \ the people. \n\nThis is joy, this is zest for life \u2013 this is the true essence\
  \ of the Iranian people."
