Text: "I have stayed in peaceful town named Razlog in Bulgaria for 2 months late 2014\
  \ for volunteer exchange program. I was young, active and welcome all the things\
  \ to my life. I loved the disable people at Welfare center where I visited every\
  \ week just to play chess with them. I missed the roses, the krane which volunteers\
  \ made for Valentine day to give for everyone. I can not forget the big and black\
  \ eyes like doll of the orphaned girl I hold in my arm, slightly clapped her back\
  \ and sang her a lullaby for the dream. I could say, Razlog in my heart, was the\
  \ best time ever in my life.\nMy host was a 40 years old - guy with very warm heart\
  \ who has secret room with plenty of interesting things. In that magical room, I\
  \ found many of their photos in the past and the booked \"The return of the native\"\
  \ of Thomas Hardy. I was in love with Eustacia character who kept strong desire\
  \ heart of love and the fire on the top hill of edge. And I found the mummer game\
  \ which connected my soul to the life of local here.\nIt was a sunny, snowy day\
  \ in new year, I was waiting to listen to the stories through a wealth of folklore\
  \ program in the town. People was gathering in square center of town. New year mummer's\
  \ carnival \"Starchevata\" has been organized for many years  that welcome first\
  \ day of new year with mummer's games and children going from house to house wishing\
  \ people a happy new year. It was used to be the centuries-old mummer tradition\
  \ in the town.\nThe mummers from Razlog are called \u201CChaushi\u201D or \u201C\
  Old Men\u201D, their costumes are manufactured of goat skin, and their cone heads\
  \ which are up to 2 meters high end with horse tails. The most important element\
  \ of the costumes is the bell, which can weigh up to 40-50 kg. The festival has\
  \ a competitive nature. Each group is assessed by a jury based on the presenting\
  \ of the mummer tradition, the way the local customs of the group region are presented,\
  \ as well as the clothes and the artistic abilities of the group. According to the\
  \ festival rules, each Bulgarian group can be presented by not more than 50 participants,\
  \ and the limitation for each foreign group is 30 participants.The festival duration\
  \ depends on the number of groups but today it continues for one or two days, belong\
  \ to each region. There is a lot of music and vivid costumes which showed the way\
  \ to leave all the bad things for last year and have meaningful of spirits for new\
  \ year."
