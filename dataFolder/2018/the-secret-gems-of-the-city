Text: "In the moment you leave your home, the place where you treasure all your most\
  \ intimate moments, in order to go to explore a place that is completely new, something\
  \ in you is changing. Travelling is the most exciting and motivating experience\
  \ you will ever experience in your life, and every time I come back from a trip\
  \ I feel richer, stronger and ready to follow my dreams. \nSo I did, this December\
  \ when I decided finally to visit one of the most charming cities in the world,\
  \ Paris. We are all used to see Paris in romantic photos and postcards, but nothing\
  \ can compare to walking trough those elegant streets, looking up to the white winter\
  \ sky, and seeing the Tour Eiffel right on top of you, almost as if it can touch\
  \ the sky. \nI'm aware that the world is full of stereotypes, and also for the french\
  \ people there is one: snobbish and with an endless ego, this is how people would\
  \ define them, especially the Parisians; but if there is one thing that surprised\
  \ me in Paris, was the kindness and the understanding of the local's.\nAs a tourist,\
  \ I wanted to visit all the major attractions of the city, but I happened to discover\
  \ that while I was walking around, the whole city seemed to my as a big work of\
  \ art: you can smell the lovely perfumes that come out of the boutiques and that\
  \ spread out in to the streets, and everywhere you look you can see hints of an\
  \ ancient empire where luxuriance and elegance where dominant. \nWhen I'm in a new\
  \ place, I try to notice those details that could seem insignificant, but that I\
  \ consider the trademarks of a certain lifestyle that is different from mine. One\
  \ day, while I was walking next to one of the several Parisian boulangerie's, I\
  \ happened to notice a girl sitting alone in one of the tables outside, with an\
  \ uninterested nonchalance of what was happening around her: she was drinking a\
  \ glass of wine and smoking a cigarette, a cliche that had become reality. \nI can\
  \ definitely say that it's not just an impression, the elegance and the glamour\
  \ of Paris are a trademark that will remain in this city forever."
