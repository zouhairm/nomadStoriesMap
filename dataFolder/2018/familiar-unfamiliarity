Text: "I watch as the doors slide closed. Slowly, wearily, yet with a certain rugged\
  \ determination, as if a willful struggle has taken up between their purpose and\
  \ their own rusting components. Inside the air seems stifled, yet the muffled coughs\
  \ and distant humming that ricochets off the faded walls of the carriage seems like\
  \ heavenly silence compared to the bustle of the streets outside. I listen carefully,\
  \ as if my ears can\u2019t quite believe that there has ever existed a world of\
  \ sound untainted by the shrieking market sellers, competing for my attention and\
  \ for my pennies. The squawk of some nearby seagull brings my attention sharply\
  \ back to the present and I marvel at how the charm of those rusty doors, who just\
  \ moments ago had seemed so unbreakable an illusion, had been so easily shattered\
  \ by so ordinary a creature. The shrill cry is anything but ordinary. The stifled\
  \ air in which I sit is far inland; the sea a distant idea, an intangible entity\
  \ to this village, whose isolation is punctuated only by the rigid tracks on which\
  \ my carriage sits; bringing food and occasional aid but never outside influence.\
  \ The squawk sounds again. This time it sounds welcoming, almost angelic, a familiar\
  \ herald of the strange, the incongruous, the distant. Perhaps this herald has come\
  \ here on an errand similar to my own. Perhaps it too, felt itself straining against\
  \ the restraints of its own concept of familiar. I smile. Perhaps.\n\nI unfurl my\
  \ palm, gently curled around the small object that had been placed there just moments\
  \ earlier. The half-remembered heat of the stranger\u2019s hand that had put it\
  \ there still lingers and seems as though it might forever. My forehead folds instinctively\
  \ into the concertina that has been exaggerated by the Indian sun\u2019s warm, bewitching\
  \ savagery. I hold the unfamiliar shape between my own familiar thumb and forefinger.\
  \ The five lines etched along its curves seem simultaneously to be part of its natural\
  \ design and yet too perfect to have been put there by anything other than a well-oiled\
  \ machine, built with the sole purpose of etching them there.\n\n\u201CThat is a\
  \ Rudraksha bead\u201D. I look up into the smiling, deeply lined face of a man I\
  \ had not noticed as I had boarded the train, \u201CFor prayer, and,\u201D he looks\
  \ at me knowingly \u201Cto protect he who wears them in wild and foreign lands\u201D\
  . The train begins to move as the man continues to smile. I close my hand and think\
  \ how well the object fits there, as if my hand had been formed with this moment\
  \ in mind."
