Text: "Arriving in\_Zanzibar\_was unlike anything I had ever seen. The airport was\
  \ so small I could see from one end to the other, baggage claim was outdoors and\
  \ the money exchange consisted of\_men shouting while waving stacks of money. I\
  \ loved every minute of it. For me, traveling is about getting out of my comfort\
  \ zone. I exchanged $200 for about 400,000 Tanzanian shilling, the bills barely\
  \ fit in my wallet. My boyfriend, still recovering from a panic attack after a lady\
  \ asked if we had our anti-malaria medication, then says the mosquitoes are going\
  \ to swarm you.\_This was his first trip to Africa and second time leaving the United\
  \ States.\n\nI don\u2019t remember why I wanted to go to\_Zanzibar. In fact, I only\
  \ wanted one thing: white sand beaches, with clear turquoise water. We got our bags\
  \ and headed straight for the beach. The days consisted of beach walks, snorkeling\
  \ and sunsets. As time wore on I admitted I would eventually get tired of this lifestyle,\
  \ in reality, however, I knew my beach life was coming to an end.\n\nWe hire a local\
  \ taxi to Stone Town, the capital of Zanzibar, but there\u2019s a catch\u2014a stop\
  \ at a spice farm. As I hesitated, convinced this was a tourist trap, we were assured\
  \ it was a \"must see\", since Zanzibar\_is the \"spice island\" and we were getting\
  \ a \"good price.\" Needless to say I caved. We drove for an hour, pulled over and\
  \ a man with a flip phone wearing a throwback jersey came running behind the van\
  \ and jumped in. I noticed a sign that read \"Kisiki Spice Farm,\" I assumed we\
  \ had arrived and this was our guide. We follow him as he began pulling up plants.\
  \ \"Try this,\u201D so I did. It\u2019s ginger! Then vanilla, cardamom, peppercorn\
  \ and cloves.\_ We saw and tasted the majority of my spice rack, except these were\
  \ the real deal. Grabbing leaves from a tree, he formed a ball and waved it near\
  \ my nose. I hadn\u2019t used Vicks Vapor Rub in a long time, but that's a smell\
  \ you NEVER forget.\n\nStone Town fulfilled a slight obsession of mine: doors. Yes,\
  \ doors. Here they were more like portals to a different dimension. I wanted to\
  \ photograph as many as possible, unfortunately it started raining, we walked into\
  \ a local market for shelter. Flintstone-sized pieces of meat were hanging on hooks,\
  \ dripping blood. \"This is where you can buy\_fresh\_meat, the cows were slaughtered\
  \ this morning\" says a guy next to me.\_I didn't need a freshness label to know\
  \ he was telling the truth.\n\nI left with a new appreciation for local and farm-to-table.\n\
  \nThe whole time we only saw one mosquito."
