Text: "It's nearing the end of our quick yet enlightening round the world trip. \n\
  Exhausted from stops such as Munich, Singapore and Hong Kong- I was happy but hesitant\
  \ to embark on our final leg.\nSeoul.\nI could come up with a dozen reasons to not\
  \ visit this country, this city. At the same time some of these very reasons could\
  \ keep a person from seeing the newest blockbuster at your local theater.\nOur flight\
  \ was only half full- a quick hop from Hong Kong.\nAfter taking the express train\
  \ from Incheon into the city and navigating to our hotel, it was decided after dinner\
  \ that sleep was in order. We would explore Seoul in the morning.\nUpon entering\
  \ the underground platform, the first thing I noticed was sparkle. Not glitter and\
  \ sequins mind you, but the gleam you get when a plate is scrubbed to maximum clean.\
  \ So clean the subway terminal was I would eat off the floor. I didn't, but I would\
  \ have!\nDrinks and food are not allowed on the train- which is just plain sloppy\
  \ and against cultural beliefs. Those precious things should be enjoyed sitting\
  \ while communicating. \nWe rode the train to Gyeongbokgung Palace. Upon arriving\
  \ to the palace we were shocked to have made such a rookie mistake: they were closed\
  \ on this particular day! We hadn't thought to look at the hours of operation.\n\
  With Bukchon Hanok village nearby our morning was nothing short of delightful. Exploring\
  \ the old village with the winding streets and views of the city was a great way\
  \ to work up an appetite.\nThe best cure for lunchtime hunger is to find where the\
  \ locals eat their lunch. \nWe descended the hill of Hanok into what looked like\
  \ a bustling market place of shops and restaurants. \nGreeting us at the door of\
  \ our chosen noodle shop was a lovely smiling lady. At our table by the window we\
  \ were treated like royalty- as were all the customers we observed. We enjoyed our\
  \ seasonal buckwheat noodles and spicy pork cutlet.\n\nAfter a bit more walking,\
  \ as Seoul is very walkable city, we decided to have a drink street side. We purchased\
  \ a soju (a distilled rice beverage unique to South Korea) and a sleeve of paper\
  \ cups to pour the drink in-as it is tacky to drink straight from the bottle. Yikes!\
  \ Soju is strong! I ran back to the adjacent convenience store for a malty Max beer.\
  \ \nRelaxing in the afternoon sun was a great opportunity to reflect. Reflect on\
  \ how this country, this city is beautiful, friendly and completely unexpected.\
  \ I was anxious, in a great way, to continue our exploration of Seoul."
