Text: "A small town in the southwest of Indian state of Karnataka, Udupi is known\
  \ for its temples, churches, and food. A place where it feels like 1985 in 2018,\
  \ there is a road that takes you to Manipal. Entering the world of Manipal is like\
  \ going to Wakanda, only this Wakanda has opened up to the rest of the world. Welcoming\
  \ tens of thousands of students from different parts of the world every year, these\
  \ Wakandans, I mean Manipalites have created a home of their own. They have come\
  \ to place with their luggage only to be welcomed with open arms. It feels like\
  \ a captain taking the cadets under his wing. The 10-minute ride from Udupi to Manipal\
  \ feels like being in a time-traveling car that takes you to a place of no judgments,\
  \ fewer hardships and lots of excitements.\nIn a town that believes in work hard\
  \ play hard, every festival is celebrated and if that\u2019s not enough, these Manipalites\
  \ have their made own festival. This festival is a week of celebration, where you\
  \ take a break from your everyday life and just have fun. What\u2019s the best part?\
  \ They welcome every other tribe in this world into their town.And show others how\
  \ they celebrate life.\nThe tribe that generally live with just their mates sometimes\
  \ do venture out of town to explore places and welcome others into their town. They\
  \ go to the beaches, to the hills and to other towns. But the Manipal in them will\
  \ not hide. They bring their town with them. It\u2019s their responsibility to carry\
  \ their innate manipalness with them. If one notices carefully one will realize\
  \ that this tribe has their own way of speaking, their own way of living, of being.\
  \ \nEntering the tribe feels weird at first but soon you end up being a part of\
  \ the family.It is one of the smoothest transitions into a tribe you can witness.\
  \ In just a couple of days, you will feel like you were here your entire life. For\
  \ the next couple of years, you make this place your home and just won\u2019t feel\
  \ like leaving. But everyone has to leave, to move on. One has to venture out into\
  \ the real world, no matter the hatred for it. \nOnce you leave the tribe and venture\
  \ out into the rest of the world you find yourself missing your tribe, your home.\
  \ You try to be a part of other tribes, other civilizations but the Manipalite in\
  \ you does not leave you. But don\u2019t worry, you will always find your fellow\
  \ tribal mate anywhere you go. It\u2019s the Manipal in you that calls out to your\
  \ fellow. One statement that holds true for this tribe? \u201COnce a Manipalite,\
  \ always a Manipalite.\u201D"
