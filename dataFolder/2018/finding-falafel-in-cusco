Text: "\u201CI want falafel!\u201D My friend blurted as the three of us began to navigate\
  \ our way in the dark along the slippery stone streets of Cusco. Theresa was fairly\
  \ drunk and Lawrence and I were more concerned with keeping her from tripping on\
  \ uneven steps than eating. \u201CLet\u2019s go to the place I went the other night.\
  \ It was so good! Come on, it\u2019s this way.\u201D We hesitated, \u201CAre you\
  \ sure?\u201D \u201CYep! This way, v\xE1manos!\u201D Lawrence looked over at me\
  \ apprehensively, \u201CI just don\u2019t want to get lost.\u201D \u201CWe won\u2019\
  t,\u201D I assured him, \u201CI can get us back. We can try to find Theresa\u2019\
  s falafel.\u201D The three of us had been in Cusco for several weeks at this point.\
  \ Tipsy walks home in the middle of the night were a regular occurrence, aided by\
  \ free rum and Cokes from 9 to 11 at the clubs near the Plaza de Armas.\n\nCusco\
  \ was constantly buzzing with tourists like us yet had managed to lock itself in\
  \ time\u2014immune to the commercialism of so many American tourist attractions\
  \ and devoid of the aggressive, opportunistic vendors found in Europe\u2019s major\
  \ cities. Cusco graciously offered up its culture and heritage to us. Its Incan\
  \ walls seemingly untouched since conquistadors stripped them of their gold to adorn\
  \ their new cathedrals\u2014testaments to the forced marriage between native traditions\
  \ and Spanish beliefs. Roadworkers maintain streets that turn into stairwells on\
  \ their hands and knees with hammers and chisels. Locals dressed in full indigenous\
  \ costumes and accompanied by lambs and llamas waiting to charge tourists for photo\
  \ ops, who would be obnoxious in any other city, add to the charm. It was hard to\
  \ feel unsafe in this anachronous city, even while drunkenly searching for falafel\
  \ in the middle of the night.\n\n\u201CHere it is!\u201D Theresa proclaimed, stopping\
  \ in front of a dark doorway. Lawrence and I glanced at each other, equally skeptical.\
  \ \u201CI think it\u2019s closed, Theresa.\u201D \u201CNo, it\u2019s not,\u201D\
  \ she insisted, \u201Clook\u2014there\u2019s T\xEDo inside, \xA1hola T\xEDo!\u201D\
  \ She waved through the window to a small man coming to open the door. Surely, I\
  \ thought, this man was coming to tell us his restaurant is closed. He opened the\
  \ door with a smile on his face. \u201C\xBFT\xEDo, comemos falafel ahora?\u201D\
  \ Theresa asked, without a shred of shame for bothering this kind man at 2 a.m.,\
  \ and to my disbelief he replied: \u201C\xA1S\xED, s\xED, pasa!\u201D We sat down\
  \ as T\xEDo started cooking, doing our best to make conversation in broken Spanish.\
  \ Lawrence and I looked at each other, completely astonished Theresa had managed\
  \ to lead us to this perfect spot in this incredible city."
