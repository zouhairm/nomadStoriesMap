Text: "Cuba, the country of contrast. The land of the romanticized revolution. There\
  \ is a sense of urgency, travellers are whispering about it; \u201CIt is going to\
  \ be too late soon, if you\u2019re going \u2013 you should go now!\u201D. The real\
  \ Cuba. The controversial leader Fidel Castro, has recently passed away, 90 years\
  \ old. The power was handed over to his younger brother Ra\xFAl a few years back,\
  \ and since then, changes has been made. The Cubans has to some extent been allowed\
  \ to open businesses and to travel abroad. And the scariest part for the ones wanting\
  \ to keep Cuba real; Americans has now been allowed to travel to the country. It\u2019\
  s a mere 40 minutes\u2019 flight from Miami. Everyone is speculating, what will\
  \ happen to Cuba? Cuba is the rebel darling of the West, and the opinions on the\
  \ country are many.\n\nMy first stop on my journey through this remarkable country\
  \ is Vi\xF1ales, a stunning green valley devoted to tobacco production. I meet Rey.\
  \ He is a 25-year old coffee, rum and honey expert. He\u2019s joking around with\
  \ American tourists, showing of a few dance steps. He overhears a German couple\
  \ talking, he says something in German to them, they laugh and he fires of a big\
  \ smile and an eye wink. Tourists love Rey. But his heart belongs to dancing. \u2013\
  \ We\u2019re all dancers in my family, but no one makes any money out of teaching\
  \ salsa, so it\u2019s better for me to work as a guide.\n\nRey is showing me his\
  \ new phone, but when I jokingly ask how he is going to use it without Internet,\
  \ he doesn\u2019t understand. \u2013 There is internet at the plaza! And he is right.\
  \ There is internet at the plaza. In most larger cities on Cuba, there are wifi\
  \ hubs \u2013 mostly concentrated to the city squares. To be able to access, you\
  \ have to buy a card for about 1 USD/hour at the government owned tele-company.\
  \ The normal waiting time to buy a card is about two hours. If you don\u2019t buy\
  \ one on the black market, that is. Trying to explain that Internet is not very\
  \ available, he just looks at me and asks \u2013 why would you want more time than\
  \ that on internet? Maybe he is right. Why would I want to spend so much time on\
  \ Internet when I could go dancing? So that\u2019s what we do, we go out dancing.\
  \ As Rey goes to the bar to buy us drinks, I notice how everyone around me are throwing\
  \ a shot of Rum over their shoulders from their newly bought Havana Rum bottle.\
  \ \"One for the saints!\" The night is young in Vi\xF1ales, and I am dancing with\
  \ the best samba/bachata/coffee/rum/honey/ expert."
