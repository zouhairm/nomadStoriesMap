Text: "Thermal Wonderland - 'Rotten-rua'\n\n\u201CThe other side of the World\u201D\
  \ was always the phrase used when I asked why uncle and aunty took so long to visit\
  \ us in England.\n\nMy first experience of travelling to New Zealand was long and\
  \ tiring but well worth the 'wait' and an eye opening one to what the world could\
  \ offer.\n\nNew Zealand as a country it's self is an inspiring place to me, and\
  \ my family\u2019s home town of Rotorua is such a beautiful place. \n\nKnown as\
  \ 'rotten-rua' by many, particularly the locals due to the pure sulphuric smells\
  \ that can be detected before you enter the town. \n\nRotorua is a small town but\
  \ offers many experiences from; Polynesian Spa Springs, Lakes, Government gardens,\
  \ National parks, extreme sports, mountain views, town life, volcanoes and Whakarewarewa-\
  \ The Living M\xE0uri Village.\n\nRenowned for its healing waters and decadent therapies,\
  \ it isn\u2019t hard to understand why people have flocked to these waters since\
  \ the 1800\u2019s. \n\nHaving had opportunity to bath in these waters to visiting\
  \ Whakaari \u2013 White Island volcano, a source of these 'healing' waters was both\
  \ an exciting and exhilarating experience. As everyone got of the boat with ease\
  \ I fall 'face' down and land on my hands and knees in to the water. \n\nThis of\
  \ course added to my excitement as I crawl on to the beach, feeling the heat from\
  \ the sand. \n\nLater on in my trip we visited Whakarewarewa - The Living M\xE0\
  uri Village gave me an authentic and unique insight to the home of New Zealand.\
  \ The hospitality and welcoming is something that gives a similar 'warming' as the\
  \ geothermal wonderland of Rotorua. \n\n\nGiven the opportunity everyone should\
  \ 'grab with both hands' and explore the true wonder\u2019s of Rotorua."
