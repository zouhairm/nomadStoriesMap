Text: "Namaste! I am Jugmohan Singh Pundir from Chamba, Uttrakhand. I am currently\
  \ working in Ashok Leyland Company from last 5 years but inside me is a hidden traveler\
  \ that loves nature, adventure, trekking and  photography. Whenever I have time\
  \ off from office, along with a group of friends I  plan some adventurous trek.\n\
  About the destination\nChandrashila is summit of the Tungnath. It literally means\
  \ \u201CMoon Rock\u201D. The meeting place of man and mountain. It is located at\
  \ a height of about 4,000 meters (13,000 ft.) above sea level. This peak provides\
  \ a spectacular view of Himalayas, especially Nandadevi, Trisul, Kedar Peak, Bandarpunchand\
  \ Chaukhamba peaks.\nThe Beauty of Chandrashila is Incredible. It is an impressive\
  \ vantage point that offers 360 degrees panoramic views of the mighty Himalayas.\n\
  The trek to the peak is 5 km. The trek route that starts from Chopta takes one to\
  \ Tungnath (highest Shiva temple in the World), from here it is a kilometer long,\
  \ and a steep trek. Chandrashila peak which offers a 370-degree view of snow-capped\
  \ mountains like Nanda Devi, Indias highest peak.\n\nThe Journey\nThis March, I\
  \ decided to explore the myriad of  trekking opportunities in Uttrakhand with my\
  \ friends. It was a random plan to move out to the heart of mountains for some days,\
  \ taking a break from pollution and those stagnant coinages. A group of 6 friends\
  \ from Ashok Leyland ,including me planned to  for go for this trek.\nBeing in Haldwani,\
  \ the best route for  Tungnath Chandrashila  was by Chaukhutiya \u2013 Karnprayag\
  \ \u2013 Gopeshwar and then Chopta.\nAmong us 1 friend had his hometown in Gopeshwar\
  \ and, as such was a regular wayfarer to Tungnath. He guided us for the route and\
  \ then finally we left by a press vehicle around 12-1 am at night from haldwani.\
  \ We reached Chaukhutiya at around 5 in the morning, where  we got ourselves a bus\
  \ to Karnaprayag and we finally reached at Gopeshwar at around 11 am. After a refreshing\
  \ breakfast  we decided to make it  a rest  day and commence for  Chopta next morning.\
  \ So for today we visited local sightseeing spots like the Gopinath temple, the\
  \ Eco Park and the Gopeshwar market. We then booked a Bolero for the next day, and\
  \ called it a night. On the trek day, we got up early, and started riding at 6 am.\
