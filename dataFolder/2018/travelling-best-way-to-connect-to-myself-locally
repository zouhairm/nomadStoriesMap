Text: "Travelling - Best way to connect to myself locally\n\nWhy high mountains?\n\
  \ - Before my 1st trip to Leh\n\nWhy deep ocean\n - Before my 1st trip to Bali\n\
  \ \nIn my last 5 years and 4 great trips these 2 were special to me for some obvious\
  \ reasons like my 1st ever trip or my 1st ever international trip.\nBut those 2\
  \ were equally surprising and scary to my friends and family.\nLeh trip was to heights,\
  \ extreme ones and Bali was to deep water and huge ocean.\nWhen I look back at my\
  \ trips, I realise this is me actually.Extremities, no mid - way but the extreme\
  \ edges only.\nAnd I thought travelling to such locations which are extreme in so\
  \ many ways like weather, feature will take me to higher level of Extremities.\n\
  But No, surprisingly I found mantra of living life the way it is or rather mid way,\
  \ way of adjustment.\n\nIt happens very rarely when your life is at the edge.Most\
  \ of the times its on mid track, routine track where it flows with the flow and\
  \ due to which you get tired, bored.\nSometimes you don't even get to know when\
  \ that boredom makes your a boring personality.Suddenly you start behaving like\
  \ that pendulum which does not stops or stays at one side but roams in the same\
  \ path.\nAnd there comes travelling. Travelling is always not for luxury or vacation\
  \ rather it's never any of that.\nIt is like tripping and exploring our own soul,\
  \ mind and heart. Making a connection with yourself and that too local connection,\
  \ a raw connection.\nLet it be adventure in the sky or getting tanned at beach,\
  \ it gives us something which can't be forgotten in life.\nIt gives us freshness,\
  \ an energy and most importantly time to introspect ourselves and broaden our mind\
  \ with experiences and lifelong memories to laugh at .\n\nWhenever we travel we\
  \ become whole renewed personality and get to know ourselves better\nAnd well that\
  \ is my reason to why highs and why deeps.\nTo travel is to make and maintain connection\
  \ with myself which is important than being in touch with millions of online personalities.\n\
  And traveling is the best way to do it. After all traveling is not only about ticking\
  \ off items from your life's bucket list but to add new exciting items to your life.\
  \ It's not only about physical adventure but to handle adventure called life gracefully\
  \ and powerfully. Not the cosmetic form of world but to find raw hidden treasure\
  \ in this world and study the history behind it to create one history.\nExplore\
  \ the legacy nature has kept for us and try to live life satisfactorily by looking\
  \ at that legacy."
