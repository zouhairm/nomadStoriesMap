Text: 'I had spent my whole life comfortable in my hometown with my parents. I had
  never lived alone. But as a science lover, I have this curiosity within me. One
  day, I decided to go study abroad. I applied to a spot in a Canadian university
  for an exchange term, just to see what would happen. Not only in Canada, but in
  one of the coldest places in this marvelous and welcoming country: Winterpeg, I
  mean, Winnipeg. I got it, and since New Year''s Eve, I have been finding my role
  in the world walking by the snowy streets of the geographic heart of Canada,  right
  in the middle of the land. But between me and this land, the world before me, there
  is nothing left. I did not expect, but the cloudy curtain between my curious mind
  and the outside was suddenly ripped. Can''t say it didn''t hurt, but it felt good.
  I feel alive. I come from the southernmost state of a tropical country, and I only
  recognized myself leaving that home. It all seemed like a prophecy from books when
  I planned, as written by Tolkien in Lord of the Rings, "not all those who wander
  are lost". And the curious, scared Brazilian girl ended up feeling the most with
  the bright sun on her face, at -25 degrees Celsius.'
