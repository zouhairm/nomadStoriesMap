Text: "\"Ow! Oh what!? What was that?\" were the words that poured out from my mouth.\
  \ Perhaps a few extra words as well but we don't need to worry about that. I had\
  \ just placed my naked foot on the sandy beach in Phu Quoc, Vietnam when a sharp,\
  \ stinging pain shot through my skin. I jumped and hopped around clutching my foot\
  \ in agony. There, wriggling in the sand, was a giant yellow wasp-thing. It was\
  \ the size of my thumb and I can only hope that it bit me instead of stung me as\
  \ I have no way to identify it. Today was the Lunar New Year celebrated round Asia.\
  \ I expected a fun time at the gorgeous beach and instead I sat on a wooden bench\
  \ staring out at the water while glancing nervously behind me at the wasp-thing\
  \ still undulating in the sand. Slowly the pain in my heel ebbed down to a warm\
  \ ache that stayed with me until the next morning. The beach was quiet despite the\
  \ fact that there were people around. My friends were going back and forth playing\
  \ football in the surf as the sun began to set in the sky shooting warm rays of\
  \ orange and yellow throughout the world. The peace and tranquility of this small\
  \ beach on a small island set me at ease. \n\nTo celebrate the Lunar New Year, or\
  \ Chinese New Year as you might know it, was to head into the center of the town\
  \ on Phu Quoc and find a bar and drink away the evening. Not my cup of tea but hey!\
  \ I was with my friends and enjoying life. No wasp-thing would take away my enjoyment\
  \ of this evening. Suddenly an elderly woman tapped me on my shoulder. She motioned\
  \ towards a lit patio overlooking the beach and motioned for me to enter the place.\
  \ My friends gathered around as we explained that \"No. We can't. We're not guests\
  \ at this hotel over here. Just came for the beach.\" But this kindly woman just\
  \ smiled and gently shoved us towards the patio.  \n\nNow the darkness had seeped\
  \ into the world and these chefs had an assortment of guests ranging from hotel\
  \ guests from Germany, a few Chinese people, and us (a motley crew of Americans\
  \ and Canadians) staying at their hotel and getting ready to eat a full meal. And\
  \ it was a full meal. Whole fish so tender that you could pull off the meat as easily\
  \ as melted butter. Chicken seasoned to perfection. French-styled bread that made\
  \ you believe you were in France not in Asia. I never expected this. The warmth\
  \ we received and the pleased look on their faces as we ate the meal together. A\
  \ big family. It was the best way to celebrate the Lunar New Year then I had ever\
  \ expected."
