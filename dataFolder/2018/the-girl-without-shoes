Text: "Even in November, it was humid enough to make my hair stick to my neck and\
  \ knot together so tightly I couldn\u2019t undo it without de-tangler. But the beauty\
  \ of the country was enough to make me brush it off, at least for a moment. The\
  \ streets of San Salvador didn\u2019t feel as dangerous as I had expected. What\
  \ was characterized in the news as a country torn apart by gang violence didn\u2019\
  t feel quite as terrifying as I had imagined. \nNot to say that it couldn\u2019\
  t be dangerous \u2013 it was. The week I arrived, gangs began to board the city\
  \ busses and rob people, and there were riots on the street. We could hear firecrackers\
  \ and guns on the major road directly behind our compound, and sometimes, the walls\
  \ shook. But every morning, we still woke up to the sound of the high school band\
  \ practicing, the brass section always a little out of tune, playing the same marching\
  \ songs. And it didn\u2019t feel so terrifying. It was a mixture of adventure, tragedy,\
  \ beauty, and poverty all in once place. \nI was peeling carrots at a shaky table\
  \ when a girl without shoes or a smile approached me. She refused to meet my gaze,\
  \ picking at one of the pink sequins on her ill-fitting shirt. \n\u201CHola,\u201D\
  \ I said softly. \u201CComo te llamas?\u201D The little girl blinked and didn\u2019\
  t say a word, as if she didn\u2019t remember. \u201CSoy Kaelan,\u201D I continued,\
  \ trying to start a conversation. I cut the carrots into little discs, wetting my\
  \ hands in water and trying not to move my feet or stir up the dust from the ground.\
  \ When I finished, I moved on to filling water buckets for kids to wash their hands\
  \ with. The little girl followed me, still silent.\n\u201CQuieres ayudarme?\u201D\
  \ She nodded, following me to the small, stone wash basin with a hose attached.\
  \ I set down the large, pink tub we were going to fill with water and steadied it\
  \ on one of the steps, before giving the hose to the girl. She put it in the bucket,\
  \ and we sat quietly, filling it together. Suddenly, she said something. Younger\
  \ brother, food, something about money, something about her parents. But my vocabulary\
  \ wasn\u2019t enough for me to understand fully.\nBefore I could say anything else,\
  \ she reached over and hugged me, clinging on. It seemed that although I wanted\
  \ to speak, we didn\u2019t quite need words. There is a universal language that\
  \ exists, and in that moment, the hug of a child was all I needed to confirm it.\n\
  I have been back to El Salvador three times since that trip, and each time I\u2019\
  ve seen Natalie, she has been different. \nAnd the last time, she was even smiling."
