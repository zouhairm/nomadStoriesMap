Text: "We are off the coast of Tikopia, Solomon Islands. Our guests relax as they\
  \ enjoy lunch inside their floating home, sheltering themselves from the heat, sun,\
  \ and strain of an expedition in Melanesia. It is a rare moment of peace in my seafaring\
  \ life. \n\nWhen the guests were ashore ready to actualize their Indiana Jones dreams,\
  \ my fellow crew members and I were the picture of service and the local islanders,\
  \ the epitome of a National Geographic brochure. The islanders indulged the guests\
  \ in posing for pictures in traditional dress and encouraged them to buy their handicrafts.\
  \ As this welcome performance proceeded, I observed the remainder of the locals\
  \ standing on the sidelines. Their faces were apathetic and unwelcoming. They spoke\
  \ to one another flashing their fearsome red teeth stained from the betel nuts they\
  \ constantly chewed on to get high. They stared at our tourists as if they were\
  \ a financially indispensable burden to their everyday lives. It was uncomfortable.\n\
  \nAfter the last zodiac full of guests left the island, the social artifice in serving\
  \ them dissolved. Both crew and islanders were at ease. The children went wild as\
  \ they ran towards us each vying for the most attention and we, in return, were\
  \ free to explore. The children dragged us into the rainforest back to their thatched\
  \ homes. Through a local translator and the village chief we learned about each\
  \ hut\u2019s specific use as well as how they buried their dead among the living.\
  \ A woman coaxed us into her home to show off her kitchen as she proudly smiled.\
  \ And when one woman shows you her kitchen, you were bound to be shown all the kitchens\
  \ in the village. They then invited us to watch a spear throwing competition along\
  \ a narrow canopied pathway. They laughed as I unknowingly stepped right onto the\
  \ playing field and yelped when a spear whizzed inches from my face. \n\nSadly we\
  \ started to return to our stations ashore. Duty called yet a friend couldn\u2019\
  t help himself and took out his drone. All hell broke loose. It reignited an encore\
  \ of the children\u2019s curiosity that we had just managed to appease. A selfie\
  \ parade ensued as boys leeched onto us, their yellow body paint leaving a pretty\
  \ mustard trail on our crisp blue uniforms. When our guests returned from their\
  \ lunch, we could not attempt to hide our hour of freedom. It was not a local encounter\
  \ filled with particular emotion or wonder, but rather, a rare one in which the\
  \ label of \u201Ctourist\u201D could not apply. It felt like a moment of camaraderie."
