Text: "My spent ligaments protested in pain beneath me. They screamed internally under\
  \ my sun-drenched legs, tightening and twisting with every step. My face turned\
  \ left and was slapped with the wet, stern hand of mother nature. She was scolding\
  \ my friends and I for making a stupid decision on our trip to Colorado. The crystal-blue\
  \ sky spun a concoction of saturated grey clouds; twirling to form a famous Rocky\
  \ Mountain storm. Looking over my left shoulder I settled on three small, dark-colored\
  \ blobs near the onset of the final summit. Sitting in a compact circle, they huddled\
  \ together in hopes of warmth while consuming Subway sandwiches boughten hours before.\
  \ Pondering the freezing figurines, I wondered how we\u2019d gotten here. The doorstep\
  \ of Mt. Ida we'd immersed from crept to mind. Streams of fresh groundwater had\
  \ oozed in abundance from metamorphic rock amongst stubborn grass layering beds\
  \ of healthy pines. The water was a melted ice bed to the touch, shooting neurons\
  \ up my veins matching the penetrating feeling of lead from a pencil. Fuzzy conifers\
  \ neighbored one another, guiding us through the first leg of our trek and offering\
  \ a closed window of silence our ears were unacclimated for. \n\nImpressions were\
  \ different in the beginning. Viewing the black and white crests weaving into one\
  \ another is a different experience when peering through the smudgy glass of a LeSabre\
  \ window. Coming from the midwest, our youthful group thought we knew snow like\
  \ a scraper knows a windshield in the early hours of a January morning. We'd wanted\
  \ a juicy, adventure-packed tale to tell our friends and family upon return from\
  \ our premier trip to the west. Equipped with an array of name-brand gym shorts,\
  \ worn-in tennis shoes, and a light jacket we\u2019d begun our quest around 10,000ft.\
  \ Little did we imagine we'd return some seven hours later; drenched in storm sweat\
  \ and undergoing the first stages of hypothermia.\n\nMy mind snapped from it\u2019\
  s reverie and my limbs moved onward again. If I could make it to the summit, I\u2019\
  d be satisfied. Minutes later, reaching the peak, my heart raced and flapped it\u2019\
  s rapid wings beneath it's cage as my scrawny arms waved to my climbing cohorts.\
  \ Spinning around, gazing at the vast white, chilled earth that lay before me, the\
  \ thumping beneath my chest began to slow and the stillness I felt drew my blonde\
  \ arm-hairs away from it\u2019s living flesh. For a few fleeting moments it was\
  \ just the mountain and me, two existing spirits stilled in the ever-changing universe."
