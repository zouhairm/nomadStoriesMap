Text: "There I was, in a bridge more than 9,000 miles away from home.  The excitement\
  \ of the ambiance was notorious, we were walking on the inner part of the bridge\
  \ to the top of the arch where the real action would take place.\nWhen we arrived,\
  \ everyone sat down while security measures were explained, I can\u2019t remember\
  \ much but my inner thoughts. I was looking at my fluorescent pink bracelet that\
  \ read: \u201CWalking Only\u201D while recalling all the experiences this trip had\
  \ already meant to me. \nMy thoughts were disrupted with cries of emotion and fear.\
  \ We were not at any bridge, we were in the Bloukrans Bridge in South Africa. Home\
  \ of the world's highest commercial bridge\_bungee\_at 216 meters (709\_ft). \n\
  I sat there looking at everyone brave enough to jump. Asking myself if I was really\
  \ going to walk the bridge back without challenging myself to jump to the unexpected.\n\
  I have been afraid to heights since forever. The idea of jumping just terrified\
  \ me. But there was a soft voice in my head telling me that the moment was today\
  \ and that, if I didn\u2019t jump, I was going to regret it. \nThe words written\
  \ at the entrance resonated in my head, \u201Ca very personal journey from fear\
  \ to elation!\u201D, and then something happened inside me. I looked for the manager\
  \ and told him: I want to jump. He asked me to stand up near the jumping platform\
  \ while part of his team started to tie the rope to my ankles. They put first a\
  \ cushion so the rope couldn\u2019t hurt my skin and later, they tied the bungee\
  \ rope.\nI can still feel my hands sweating and my heart pumping fast. They asked\
  \ me to cautiously move to the jumping platform. Even though I was terrified this\
  \ was a personal challenge. I had to do it on my own and that meant jumping by myself\
  \ and not waiting to be pushed. The words: \u201COne, two, three\u2026 Bungee!\u201D\
  \ went through my ears and into my heart. I took a deep breath, raised my arms up\
  \ and, jumped.\nTime seemed to stop while everything in front of me moved in waves,\
  \ like water, away from me. It was amazing! I start feeling the recoil and it was\
  \ not hard at all but smooth and surreal. I felt the moment printed on my heart\
  \ forever, while I was floating over the Bloukrans River.  The rope stop moving.\
  \ I was pending looking at the scenery between the mountains thinking how lucky\
  \ I was and how proud of me I felt. That day I did as Richard Norton once said:\
  \ \u201CTo escape fear, you have to go through it, not around it.\u201D And I conquered\
  \ myself."
