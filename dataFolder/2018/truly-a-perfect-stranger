Text: "I started writing my second book in 2015, whose title and contents are about\
  \ the Soul. After much work and trials it's nearly finishedt and in November 2017\
  \ an amazing synchronicity happened. A friend had asked me the contact of another\
  \ friend some months ago. I had sent her a message but she only replied a couple\
  \ of days before my departure to the UK. I gave my friend the good news and recalled\
  \ he\u2019s British. Since I was going to the UK, I asked if he knew Bristol. On\
  \ that same day he suggested some places. On the second day there, I decided to\
  \ visit one of them: a pedagogical farm. Upon delighting myself with the fresh air\
  \ and the contact with the animals, I went on to eat at a vegetarian organic restaurant\
  \ right next to the farm.\nI chose my table, put the coat on a chair and checked\
  \ the menu written on a chalk board, a few steps away. When I returned a man was\
  \ sitting by the side of my chair. He saw me and hesitated. He went on to apologize,\
  \ but also suggested, somewhat shyly, that perhaps we could both sit on the same\
  \ table. My answer was \u201CYes of course, we are human beings. We came here to\
  \ connect to each other\u201D.\nWe had lunch, shared some stories, hobbies and smiles.\
  \ Several times he mentioned how synchronicities just happen in life. As lunch came\
  \ to an end, he asked my name. When I gave him my last name, he became enthusiastic,\
  \ his smiled widened even more and he looked positively amused. Something in him\
  \ loved the \u201Ccoincidence\u201D. He confided with me that one of his favourite\
  \ books is \u201CPereira Maintains\u201D and suggested me to read it. He said that\
  \ I\u2019d might have to order it but I could always check one of Bristol\u2019\
  s bookshops on my way back to the centre, not so likely to have a hard copy for\
  \ sale.\nAfter such a pleasant and surprising lunch, we said good-bye and thanked\
  \ each other\u2019s presence. On the way back I decided to go and look for the book.\
  \ To my surprise the salesman found it! Bought it and could not stop reading! I\
  \ finished it on the late evening of my third day in Bristol, just before starting\
  \ a Writers\u2019 Workshop. Tears poured down my face in amazement and gratitude\
  \ as I read on the last page \u201C(\u2026) tell Dr. Pereira to write an article\
  \ about the soul, because that\u2019s something we all need (\u2026)\u201D\nIt was\
  \ the last piece of motivation that I needed to trust myself, to trust I was on\
  \ the right path, a feeling of unshakeable faith, totally guided by life.\nThe name\
  \ of this perfect stranger was Christopher and this episode sure felt like an offer\
  \ from Christ!"
