Text: "There was one year my mom made $6,000 the entire year. She was a single mom\
  \ and raising a child completely alone and while she did everything she could do\
  \ to ensure my happiness, my soul felt empty. I felt dead inside as if to only be\
  \ walking through my life existing, not living. I had always craved for something\
  \ beyond the 9-5 cubicle life I was so miserably living and one year in Thailand\
  \ I met a guy at my hostel who changed my life forever. He opened my eyes to an\
  \ entirely new world and his words \u201CI quit my job to travel\u201D swirled ferociously\
  \ around inside my head for months once I returned. He doesn\u2019t even realize\
  \ it yet but in that moment he breathed life into my soul for the first time. I\
  \ too decided to quit my job 90 days later, and I have never looked back. I\u2019\
  ve been fishing for my dinner with the locals in random villages in Vietnam, I\u2019\
  ve forced myself to face my biggest fear - heights - and hurled myself to the ground\
  \ bungy jumping 134m just to chase that natural high, I had the most amazingly romantic\
  \ love affair in Spain with the man of my dreams, I\u2019ve explored hidden caves\
  \ in Thailand, I\u2019ve been awakened by random 4am firework shows going on outside\
  \ my balcony in Greece, I\u2019ve dined with the locals in the smallest of areas\
  \ in Cambodia, I\u2019ve climbed the Great Wall of China....I could go on, but I\
  \ think you see my point. My heart is finally alive, and I see my future with so\
  \ much more clarity now. My journey to self discovery is one I\u2019m so very thankful\
  \ for, and I can honestly say it saved my life. Without the wind in my hair, the\
  \ sand between my toes, the sunsets at the top of mountains, I wouldn\u2019t have\
  \ made it through this life alive. I would have been walking around a zombie, being\
  \ pushed by society to get married, have kids and keep a stable job so I can save\
  \ for retirement for the rest of my life. But I chose a different route: start a\
  \ company and be my own boss, blow through my savings because let\u2019s face it\
  \ - I\u2019ve never seen a uhaul behind a hearse all so I could meet amazing people\
  \ and have insane adventures all over the world.  I can truly say I\u2019m finally\
  \ living the ultimate dream of freedom and it sure as hell feels good."
