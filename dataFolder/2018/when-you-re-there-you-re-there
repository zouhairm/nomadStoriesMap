Text: "My story is not a travel story, specific; though, I have many that can easily\
  \ shared. It is; however, poignant, and one I keep near and dear because it\u2019\
  s the one that started it all. \n\nSo there I was, lodged in an unpleasant corner\
  \ of indecision; plagued by worry and hungry curiosity. These dreams had been resting\
  \ on their laurels for long enough and if they rested much longer, then they might\
  \ never be. Lying alone in my room, burdened by agitating thoughts. My life was\
  \ going nowhere. I just had to do it.\n\nLike many girls, I was taught to be afraid\
  \ of being alone. Traveling alone was an enigma that only the bravest could partake\
  \ in. The desire was there, to be sure: a girl so wholly inspired by places shown\
  \ in her films and from the dusty novelties belonging to her father when he was\
  \ a man about the world thanks to his job. I told my mother I\u2019d see them all\
  \ some day and she nodded with that all knowing yet unconfirmed, \u201CSomeday.\u201D\
  \ \n\nI was fortunate enough to have seen so much already - with parents originating\
  \ from Europe came the gift of actually going there.  But the desire to see all\
  \ reached much further and when it surfaced, crippling fear made an appearance as\
  \ well. \nI couldn\u2019t imagine standing there on untouched soil, alone, suitcase\
  \ in hand, in the midst of strange people, lost forever!  So I reached for a support:\
  \ a brother, a boyfriend, or anyone to shoulder me from the harrowing possibilities.\
  \ \n\nWhen an unhealthy 4-year relationship came to its ultimate demise, it hurled\
  \ me from safety into unshielded exposure; totally alone, sad and unfulfilled. Where,\
  \ after only knowing what it was to be dependent, would? I was in that unpleasant\
  \ corner. \nBut I just had to do it. \nSo, in a pivotal a moment I would call my\
  \ proudest, I bought a ticket to South Korea, three months to give it a try. \n\n\
  It was the best thing I ever did for myself, having now been to more than 30 countries\
  \ and counting. It\u2019s shown me how ridiculous that fear was because it\u2019\
  s only the fear of getting there. But when you get there, you\u2019re simply \u201C\
  there\u201D; soaking it up and weaving through challenges as you continue to leap.\
  \ I can\u2019t imagine how my life would\u2019ve been had I never made that decision,\
  \ but I\u2019m grateful to say that I am worlds away from that frightened girl.\
  \ And when I hear someone else who tells me they\u2019re afraid, I tell them they\
  \ just have to do it."
