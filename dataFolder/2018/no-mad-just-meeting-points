Text: "While Luca delivers blankets, I do my usual rounds with the tea. First the\
  \ newcomers.\nA guy try to get on a train but the gurd pushed him down.\nI put the\
  \ box of tea on a bench to help him while he curses in his language.\nSorry, I do\
  \ not understand! Where are you from?\nGorizia!\nEheh, no I mean..\nand him serious:\n\
  yes.. fire at Brezice.. we run.. at Sentilj police and we run.. in Kobane bombs,\
  \ fire and we run, run, always run.. always war.. in Sentilj police take me and\
  \ I lost Tirife, Tirife pregnant!\nNow with broken voice then watery eyes.\n\nMaybe\
  \ he is Syrian. I only know how to say \"my bro\" in kurdish and I try:\nBrakham!\
  \ \u2013 I say opening my arms.\n\nHis face light up. He stands still, looking at\
  \ me. Two big tears that caressed his cheeks carved by time. He hugs me. The train\
  \ whistles, snorts and starts again. He raises his head from my shoulder and realizes\
  \ that his chance is slipping away. He heads towards the train. I hold my embrace\
  \ to keep him away from danger. He\u2019s wiggling around to such an extent that\
  \ his jacket left in my hands. The train is already far. He puts his hands on his\
  \ head slides them to cover his eyes. He breaks down. He seems resigned but unexpectedly\
  \ he goes off desperately. He tears off his shirt. The buttons squirt away like\
  \ Kalashnikov bullets, falling down on a man who got off that train to Austria.\
  \ Then shirtless he gose to lie on the track hugging it like a pillow.\n\nI'm going\
  \ to sit next to him. I look down there at infinity where the parallel lines meet.\
  \ Before the infinity there is still the train just left.\nThen I look at him. He\
  \ avoids my eye. And begins to repeat in a hallucinated loop:\nI want to die, I\
  \ want to die\u2026\nIf we stay here the police will arrive then it will take days,\
  \ maybe months or years, before you can get to Austria.\nI lost Awat!\nWho is Awat?\
  \ Your son?\n\u201CAwat\u201D means hope, wish. Awat is my name!\nCome on. I'm Ale!\n\
  and I hold out my hand and with the other I give him the jacket.\nWe approach the\
  \ man with a shirt.\nThe policemen arrive to take with them Awat.\nI know that \u2013\
  \ say the man.\nWho Awat?\nNo his story. I'm from Argentina. My grandparents were\
  \ Italian.\nllegaron all\xE0 el Mayo 1914.\nfueron divididos en el porto de Genova\
  \ porque la guerra que empezava quier\xECa hombres.\nel barco parti\xF2 y mi nonna\
  \ se fue sola y embarazada.\nse encuentraron todavia una semana despues.\nmi nonno\
  \ se embrac\xF2 con un buque de guerra que alcanz\xF2 al Vapor PrincipessaMafalda\n\
  y justo en el medio del oceano\nso him begans to tell..."
