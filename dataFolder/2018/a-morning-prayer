Text: "In the hour before sunrise, Cape Town appeared to be a circuit board from above.\
  \ On top of Lion\u2019s Head Mountain, I could barely see one foot in front of the\
  \ other. Behind me, two girls debated whether to use a cellphone flashlight or to\
  \ let their eyes gradually adjust. \nI stumbled over tree branches, loose stones,\
  \ and small dips in the path, on a quest to see  sunrise from the peak of one of\
  \ the more modest but no less majestic mountains overlooking the city. The hiking\
  \ trail was an easy one in the daylight, one that joggers frequently ran up and\
  \ down before breakfast. In the middle of the night, my ankles turned on every pebble.\
  \ \nI was less than halfway to the top, thighs burning and panting, when I stubbed\
  \ my toe on something. I stepped back, groaning. But the implication was more painful\
  \ than the bruise.\n\u201CAn enormous boulder is blocking the trail. Could be a\
  \ dead end.\u201D I called to the hikers behind me. To my right was a steep rock\
  \ face, and to my left \u2013 the edge. Better not. Time was running out: the sky\
  \ was now a shade of indigo. Did we somehow take a wrong turn? I squatted down.\n\
  \u201CI guess we could watch the sun from here.\u201D It was a panoramic view: the\
  \ Atlantic Seaboard, a black sky-ocean, to my right and the subdued but no less\
  \ glittery Cape Town below. We sat in the dark, chilled in the South African winter.\n\
  In the silence, I could detect a sound so similar to high-altitude wind that I thought\
  \ it was my imagination. Then, I began to pick out a melody. Months later, watching\
  \ a video of a mathematician skating on thin ice to capture the sounds of ice flexing\
  \ to his weight, I would think of the sound we heard: a wolf howling at the moon,\
  \ a benevolent haunting, all things silver. \nIt was the call to prayer in a country\
  \ that is reportedly less than 1.5% Muslim. \nWhen the melody stopped, I got up\
  \ off my heels.\nWith my foot and arm, I felt around the rock. Then above. I felt\
  \ a depression. My eyes had adjusted. The path was not around, but over.\nOn the\
  \ way down, the landscape had absorbed all the moisture of the early morning and\
  \ was deeply saturated. I passed wet plum-colored rocks along a road of red dirt\
  \ turned fuchsia. In the distance was the navy ocean against a foreground of spiky\
  \ green plants. After a morning of darkness, the world was in full color. It was\
  \ not at the peak, looking down at Cape Town, but on the hike down that I understood\
  \ the rarity of this vantage point."
