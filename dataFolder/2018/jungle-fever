Text: "It was a hunt like I hadn\u2019t experienced before in my 70 days in the remote\
  \ Bolivian jungle. Something near had elicited Amira\u2019s natural predatory instincts,\
  \ instincts so often inhibited due to her caged destiny. I could hear my heart thumping,\
  \ the amateur, attached behind by a rope. I couldn\u2019t detect what her feline\
  \ senses could, but it was big. Her 65kg body rigid, her giant paws precisely tiptoeing\
  \ as if walking a tightrope, undetectable over the normally rustling terrain. For\
  \ weeks we\u2019d sighted prints, size alone predicting ownership to South America\u2019\
  s largest big cat, the jaguar. My body bombarded with adrenaline, was I about to\
  \ encounter a jaguar face off? Do I sabotage her stalking for my safety? That thought\
  \ quickly discarded, remembering my role- enriching her now captive life. Amira,\
  \ a fortunate jag at Comunidad Inti Wara Yassi animal orphanage, deemed humanised\
  \ enough for daily walks outside her cage. Others too wild for such privileges.\
  \ None re-releasable. My gumboot feet stood no chance; I was lurched through the\
  \ air, Amira excelling like a speedboat, the sheer force rendering my pants down\
  \ as I was dragged along my stomach, chasing a giant anteater. Eventually Amira\
  \ succumbed, gazing back at me, dead weight she had lugged behind. The chase was\
  \ over. Jungle stillness restored. An anti-climax without reward for Amira, yet\
  \ my reward was clear. I had ventured here after 6 months of lazing on countless\
  \ Brazilian beaches, carefree, suddenly realising how self-absorbed backpacking\
  \ had become. A social worker by profession, perhaps always destined to find myself\
  \ in such an environment. I had just been involved in a wild pursuit, one which\
  \ the likes of David Attenborough would aspire to capture from afar. It made me\
  \ wonder how anyone would want to harm such majestic beasts. Yet that was Amira\
  \ and other species at the sanctuary\u2019s story. Traumatised, mothers killed by\
  \ poachers, babies sold in the black market, to the circus, beaten and forced to\
  \ perform. As I fed Amira for the final time, her behaviour altered. A daily routine\
  \ usually characterised by her devouring food, unperturbed by my departure, but\
  \ this time would see her stop, holding my gaze, as I walked away. Her well-tuned\
  \ intuition knew, like so many volunteers before, I was leaving. What she doesn\u2019\
  t know, is the impact she will have on me forever. Arriving, I naively thought the\
  \ animals were lucky to have volunteers, but now I realise I was the lucky one and\
  \ that her story needs to be told."
