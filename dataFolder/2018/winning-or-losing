Text: "'Please stop darling'. Mum was gently pulling at my hand, whilst the market\
  \ stall owner's eyes sank a little lower. At aged 12 I understood the concept of\
  \ bartering. It was just a fun game. A game I nearly always won. What wasn't so\
  \ clear to me, was that the owner was trying to make a living. I was verging on\
  \ insulting him, but in desperation he was going to give in.\n\nBack in Egypt again,\
  \ aged 20. Those dry dusty streets with the baking heat piercing each in-breath.\
  \ The sound of prayers surfing the air as you wake up each day. There's something\
  \ special about Egypt.  Falling in love with every explosive smell or colourfully,\
  \ ancient street. Feeling melted with each smile from a local or when they drop\
  \ to their knees in prayer, in the middle of the day. It was a tasting menu for\
  \ the Arabic world.\n\nTowards the end of the trip I found myself bartering again.\
  \ I was buying a fairly large amount of the ornate glass perfume bottles. The shop\
  \ keeper was huffing and muttering under his breath the more I kept lowering or\
  \ sticking to my price. I was winning. I'd forgotten again that this was a man,\
  \ about his livelihood, and his pride. I was back to that little girl, except this\
  \ time, no one was advising me to stop. Eventually he was shouting at me to leave\
  \ his shop. He was angry and insulted. I had lost and now I shouted back and rushed\
  \ out. \n\nStorming off down the road, the adult in me came crashing back. I'd realised\
  \ that I'd gone way too low and I felt a dumper truck of guilt. I was ashamed. I\
  \ sat down at a nearby cafe and pondered on the uneasy interaction I'd just caused.\
  \ \n\nThat's when the shop keeper came strolling over towards me. 'Do you have a\
  \ mobile phone?' he asked softly. 'No!' I lied. He had followed me and was going\
  \ to lecture me on how rich I was, if I admitted to owning one. 'So this isn't yours?'\
  \ he asked with a knowing look, holding out my mobile phone that I'd left behind.\
  \ My mouth opened and closed rendered speechless. He placed the phone on the table.\
  \ 'I am a Muslim. We do not steal', he stated then meandered back towards his shop.\
  \ \n\nThat was the last thing I had expected.\n\nThe next day I returned to his\
  \ shop. I thanked him endlessly, with the only Arabic word I knew, '\u0160okran'!\
  \ I bought all the perfume bottles from him. This time at full price. No bartering.\
  \ Perhaps the last thing he had expected. \n\nNow wherever I go in the world. If\
  \ given the opportunity to barter, I think of the shopkeeper and remind myself it's\
  \ not about winning or losing."
