Text: "I sat on the ground, legs in front of me one hand behind me, wrist throbbing,\
  \ the other tentatively holding my camera as I turned it around inspecting it for\
  \ damage. It seemed fine, my wrist too, although when I looked out at the rolling\
  \ hills, the snow-covered Great Wall of China, snaking through them in both directions\
  \ I couldn't help but feel simultaneously lucky and spooked. I was literally sitting\
  \ on the edge of the wall. If I'd slid another ten centimetres I'd have probably\
  \ fallen off. Our tour guide helped me up, she seemed more concerned about my camera\
  \ as she grabbed it off me, despite feeble protestations and slung it around her\
  \ neck. \"You ok?\", she asked laughing, \"you looked so funny!\". My best friend\
  \ grabbed my arm \"I think I should hold onto you like this until we finish\". The\
  \ fourth member of our group, a man in his mid-thirties, looked at me as though\
  \ I had greatly inconvenienced him, before pushing onwards, alone. \nWe had left\
  \ our hostel in Beijing early that morning, taking a small private bus to Jinshanling\
  \ for a walking tour. We had chosen this part because it was supposedly one of the\
  \ few portions that remained relatively unrestored, and we were fit enough to manage.\
  \ I had two footwear options- a pair of sneakers or lined boots. It was cold, I\
  \ chose lined boots. Unfortunately, the grip seemed to have disappeared and I discovered\
  \ this over the course of the first hour of our hike, slipping and sliding over\
  \ patches of day old snow and black ice, stepping tentatively on diagonals to avoid\
  \ falling. \nOur guide raced ahead, occasionally hiding behind ruins or in watch\
  \ houses as she waited for us to catch up, jumping out to surprise us as we approached\
  \ and laughing hysterically. She told us a little about Mongolia, but mostly she\
  \ told us stories of wild boars mauling people in the valleys below. We took photos\
  \ of the expansive landscape, hills framed by the snaking wall in the distance,\
  \ stone steps providing depth, and at the end our guide took a photo of us, smiling,\
  \ me clutching my best friend to avoid slipping over again. \nWe finished with a\
  \ meal at a small restaurant near the exit. Hungry and cold, I was grateful for\
  \ the warm dishes of vegetables and tofu. I could feel a large bruise forming on\
  \ my thigh and my wrist throbbed. \"How long are you travelling?\", the man who\
  \ had also been on the tour asked us, \"just a month\", I replied, \"how about you?\"\
  \ my best friend asked, \"six years\", he replied unexpectedly glumly, looking down\
  \ at his food."
