Text: "I grabbed the chair uncertainly, still recovering from the dry heat in Plaza\
  \ de Armas. Julio, standing still in front of me, was only concerned about the shiny\
  \ black chess pieces tickling in his hands. I had never felt so small while sitting\
  \ on a chair.\n\nSummer breeze in Santiago was blended with the colours of pale\
  \ majestic facades and merged its gusts with sounds of laughter and proselytizers\
  \ far away. But besides of the fuzziness surrounding me, I felt like stranded after\
  \ the time spent on the mountains in the south. But when you walk around Santiago,\
  \ you always know which precise story you are taking part of. Everything in that\
  \ city was keeping an unconceivable oath with history.\n\nMy mate made his first\
  \ move, even though he hadn\u2019t talked to me at all. There seemed to be a pure\
  \ logic behind a Chilean and his binds with the silence. People around us were up\
  \ to mix sweet mote with plastic spoons while watching me and Julio playing. The\
  \ air around us smelled of absorption, peaches in syrup and tobacco.\n\nCold fact:\
  \ I was the only one distracted by ordinary life. \xAB You got frozen like el Milod\xF3\
  n! \xBB Julio giggled, since he easily checkmated me. While wisely brushing his\
  \ white beard, he kept his mind drumming. \xAB Come, now I get back to work. \xBB\
  . He said, heading back to his taxi.\n\nWhile we were on the cab, we spotted some\
  \ strange thin shapes on a far corner along the way. He immediately started recalling\
  \ an old story from 1973, the story of three young professors who were killed for\
  \ refusing to give up to the golpe. The car stopped somewhere along one of those\
  \ concrete highways. \xABWe know this story is one of many. But we first had to\
  \ accept it, before understanding it. \xBB Admitted with firm voice and trembling\
  \ italian, showing a bit of sentiment. \n\nHis silence under the three giant chairs\
  \ entitled to Parada, Guerrero and Nattino was the real silence of dignity. He was\
  \ almost a child when all happened, but his heart was still clung to their names.\
  \ We walked under the imposing wooden icons and the sun vanished from over our heads.\
  \ \xAB You know, compadre, sometimes you better see things sitting under a chair\
  \ rather than on it. \xBB He messed me up.\n\nAt that point, I suddenly understood\
  \ that I hadn\u2019t been playing a chess game and why I felt so small. I had sat\
  \ on my conscience to grow it tall enough to perceive the silent voice of memory.\
  \ And incredibly, for the first time of my life I was being part of it. Whereas\
  \ for the second time I was foolishly checkmated, again."
