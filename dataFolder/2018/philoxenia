Text: "\u201CCome!\u201D shouts Maria.  All summer, she told me she would teach me\
  \ her grandmother's recipe for trachanas, a 2,000-year-old pasta. Grabbing my hand,\
  \ I expected her to lead me into the kitchen. Instead, she led me through the back\
  \ door, towards the pasture. She held up her pointer finger to say \u201CFirst,\u201D\
  \ and then pointed to our subject as if to say, \u201Cmeet the goat.\u201D\nI had\
  \ committed to a 3-month house-sit in Greece in search of a culinary adventure,\
  \ and I was told I'd find it in the remote village of Kalavryta. My bus had pulled\
  \ me away from the frenzied streets of Athens and into the mountains of the northern\
  \ Peloponnese. As the driver switched into low gear, so did the pace of life outside\
  \ my window. Roads narrowed, men sold honey at roadside stands, goats tried their\
  \ best to stop traffic. This was more my speed.\nI was rewarded with the discovery\
  \ that my neighbors for the summer were also extraordinary chefs who run a taverna\
  \ next door. George is an instructor at the culinary institute in Patras, and creates\
  \ masterful dishes with modern flare. His wife Maria, the authority on traditional\
  \ Greek comfort food. Within their relationship I saw the face of modern Greece,\
  \ clinging to old traditions against the enthusiasm of future progress \u2013 two\
  \ opposing views that bickered back and forth between drags of a cigarette.  Their\
  \ constant banter was the soundtrack to my rookie batch of trachanas.\nIts dough\
  \ is made by mixing flour with fresh goat's milk in a process that takes several\
  \ days from start to finish. In my travels, I've found that language barriers don't\
  \ exist so much in the kitchen and, though we didn\u2019t speak each other's language,\
  \ we managed to produce a year's worth of pasta in the course of a week, laboriously\
  \ grating the dough into tiny granules that would be used in the restaurant's signature\
  \ dish. \nFor thousands of years, Greece has weathered invasions, rebellions, and\
  \ economic upheaval. I would have thought such a tumultuous history would render\
  \ generations of its citizens guarded and distant. But, instead, I found philoxenia:\
  \  the Greek credo of hospitality is a non-negotiable way of life. Theirs is a debilitating\
  \ hospitality that knows no bounds, but I forgave George and Maria their borderline\
  \ bossiness \u2013 the excited demands that I eat this, drink that, try this, take\
  \ these, keep that, go here, visit there. I even forgave Maria for making me cry,\
  \ as she pressed a 5-pound bag of trachanas into my hands: my most precious souvenir."
