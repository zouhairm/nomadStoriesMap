Text: "I woke up that I was squeezing between the hands the drawing: it was a real\
  \ artwork. Foud it was a fortune for a cartoonist like me. I had picked it up from\
  \ the toilette floor of the Istanbul airport. At the time of the discovery nobody\
  \ had can to help me. There is no signature on the drawing but only a date in Spanish:\
  \ 3 de noviembre de 1994. This date didn\u2019t remind me of anything other than\
  \ the anniversary of my name day. \nThe drawing is only sketched and represents\
  \ an hug between two people. Isn\u2019t clear whether it\u2019s a man and a woman\
  \ but it\u2019s obvious that they are hugging strongly and affectionately like two\
  \ who don\u2019t see each other to long time. \nOn the plane to Milan my only concern\
  \ was to find the author of the drawing. I had decided to go the way to this story\
  \ although I knew it wasn\u2019t an easy undertaking to start from an drawing. \n\
  In the next months I worked as a teacher in a secondary school and continued to\
  \ follow a few lessons in University of Milan. The study and work commitments gave\
  \ me a lot to do. Despite this, I continued to carry out research about the drawing.\
  \ So I found a lot of historical facts related to that date, apparently without\
  \ connections with the drawing.\nOn 5th February 2018 something important happened\
  \ in my life: during the inauguration ceremony of the academic year the honoris\
  \ causa degree was awarded to three Madres of the desaparecidos.\nIt was precisely\
  \ for this occasion that I came across the date marked on the drawing. In fact the\
  \ members of the organization H.I.J.O.S, composed of the children of the desaparecidos,\
  \ met for the first time in the far 3rd November 1994 in La Plata! This discovery\
  \ was a positive shock and a input for go on in my research.\nThe data relating\
  \ to the drawing  coincided with the history of the desaparecidos: the date, the\
  \ Spanish language and the depicted embrace. I decided that I would have to leave\
  \ for Argentina as soon as possible. \nActually, my journey had already started\
  \ on the day of the discovery. Several searches led me to know a blacklist with\
  \ a lot of names of artists and intellectuals considered subversive by dictators\
  \ between 1976 and 1983.\nA few days later I read an article about a scholarship\
  \ for writers traveling to Argentina with World Nomads: it was another blow to the\
  \ heart. It seemed an opportunity makes precisely for me and I decided to fight\
  \ for that place.\nMeanwhile, history has certainly not stopped, it is only waiting\
  \ to be written."
