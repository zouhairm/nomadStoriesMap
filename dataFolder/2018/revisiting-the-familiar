Text: "I wasn't expecting much from my weekend getaway to Victoria, BC. \n\nI\u2019\
  ve lived there for many years and I\u2019ve seen it all: the silent air of the beach\
  \ punctuated by the sound of waves slithering into the sand; the scorched sunrays\
  \ sinking into the blood-red horizon; the deer gracefully striding through the tall\
  \ trees; the mossy woodland fresh with morning dew. \n\nNow, I was back during the\
  \ least exciting month of the year; January. I was strolling downtown and my mind\
  \ was hazy with laziness. I kept taking aimless steps and the winding streets took\
  \ me to the Fisherman\u2019s Wharf.\n\nIt was a typical cloudy day. The sky an expanding\
  \ white blanket and everything below it was coated in grey.\n\nI stepped on the\
  \ precarious grounds of the wharf. Figurative ground because the Fisherman\u2019\
  s Wharf is stretched on a small corner of the Pacific Ocean. Floating docks, boats,\
  \ and homes were surfing the small ripples, wobbling ever so slightly. \n\nThe wharf\
  \ is a lively sight during the warm summer days, there is never a dull moment. The\
  \ smell of fish and chips wafting in the air while sun-soaked tourists line up for\
  \ fried foods and ice cream. Seagulls scouting for unattended food while seals sink\
  \ and resurface, teasing their audience. \n\nBut this day held no excitement. Everything\
  \ was still. Yet everything was in constant motion. \n\nThere was a strange beauty\
  \ to the abandoned wharf. The multicoloured homes were standing brighter against\
  \ the grey day, surrendered by a tranquil bliss. \n\nI trod lightly on the narrow\
  \ wooden alley. My heels clunked, interrupting the hush. There were no seagulls\
  \ or seals jabbing the quiet atmosphere. Just the solid me, on an unbalanced structure,\
  \ that holding on to the salty fluid. \n\nAt the same time, all was grounded and\
  \ divine. As if the summer days corrupted the wharf\u2019s innocent beauty. The\
  \ abundance of life somehow took its liveliness. How can something so unstable,\
  \ purposed to be used for only a short window of the year, transfer such firm assurance\
  \ to someone?\n\nI wondered; how many times have I revisited myself? Who is the\
  \ raw me, stripped of materials, schedules, and the hectic race? Who am I on bad\
  \ days, who am I on good days?\n\nMy prejudices assess me under the spotlight of\
  \ social fabrications, but just like the Fisherman\u2019s Wharf, there is a solid\
  \ beauty buried in me that awaits to rise in solitude."
