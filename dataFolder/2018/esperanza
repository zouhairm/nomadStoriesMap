Text: "Anyone who says Barcelona winters aren\u2019t cold can shove it. After the\
  \ warmth and light of a stranger\u2019s kitchen, the night\u2019s streets were even\
  \ colder as I set out for my first shift with Esperanca, a volunteer-led effort\
  \ to provide the homeless with meals. There were five of us on the route, three\
  \ English women, one German student, and me, the sole American, winding our way\
  \ down the streets of El Raval, each dragging a wheeled shopping trolley loaded\
  \ with food. \nJo, the most experienced of the group, led the way, chattering in\
  \ English and showing off her heavily accented Spanish. I jogged a little to keep\
  \ up and stay warm.\nAfter a minute or two, Jo ducked off the street under the awning\
  \ of a bank. The bank was closed, but the lobby\u2019s fluorescents still burned\
  \ bright and the door was left open to afterhours ATM customers. Lining the floor\
  \ on the far wall were heaps of blankets, dark against the lobby\u2019s pale tiles.\
  \ The center of each pile rose and fell with the breath of its occupant. We filed\
  \ in from the street one after the other as Jo bustled up to the first of the heaps.\
  \ At the sound of her voice, three men emerged from their cocoons. Stunned, sleepy,\
  \ blinking hard, they took the food we handed them, nodding at each acquisition.\
  \ What must it be like to be approached by a gaggle of foreign women hoisting eggs\
  \ and oranges under your nose and mispronouncing the word for \u201Cmuffin\u201D\
  ?\nWe left the group, still half-stunned, to their meal and wound further into the\
  \ cobbled streets. The cold was forgotten as I reveled in the strangeness of bursting\
  \ through the invisible boundaries between cultures, between languages, between\
  \ where different people happened to land after a few twists of fate. We delved\
  \ into places our instincts were honed to avoid, the dark recesses of an empty park,\
  \ the shadowed alcoves of abandoned buildings, and found hunger.\n We met a few\
  \ dozen people that night, but one man stands out to me. When we first saw him,\
  \ he was standing under a streetlamp cradling a bulky garbage bag. He was happy\
  \ to accept our food, and spoke some English, so we exchanged names and pleasantries.\
  \ Before we moved on, I offered him backpack that had been donated to the group.\
  \ \n\u201CNo thank you,\u201D he said, \u201CI don\u2019t need.\u201D He gestured\
  \ to his garbage bag. \u201CHave bag.\u201D\nAny self-congratulation I\u2019d been\
  \ for giving up my Saturday night vanished. Embarrassed to be here in his country\
  \ but knowing none of his words, I took his hand and wished him a good night."
