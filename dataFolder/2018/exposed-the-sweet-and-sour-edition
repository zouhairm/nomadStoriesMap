Text: "\u201CYou\u2019re moving where?\u201D was the common exclamation of friends\
  \ and family after I announced my plans to relocate to Shenzhen, China. The question\
  \ was almost always followed by a puzzled face, and the question \u201CYou speak\
  \ Chinese?\u201D My standard reply was \u201Cno but a smile goes a long way.\u201D\
  \ After graduating with a degree in sustainable tourism, I knew I wanted to continue\
  \ my work of diversifying the existing images of the American tourist. Despite annual\
  \ girls\u2019 trips to stellar all-inclusive resorts, I didn\u2019t have any international\
  \ experience that I could add to my resume. After months of applying for jobs in\
  \ international education, I received yet another email with the ever dreadful phrase\
  \ \u201Cwe\u2019ve chosen a candidate whose background more closely matches the\
  \ requirements of the position\u201D. With three degrees and no opportunities stateside\
  \ something clicked; I realized that it was now or never. \n\nI\u2019d been in the\
  \ country for about 20 minutes when an airport employee shouted \u201Cni hao\u201D\
  \ as she ran up to me waving her hands in the air. My mind began racing. What could\
  \ I possibly have done wrong? Now standing beside me, she again said \u201Cni hao\u201D\
  \ this time stroking my long braids. She smiled, gave me a thumbs up and waved goodbye;\
  \ and so began one of many encounters of my year abroad.  \n\nWith each new class,\
  \ I began my lessons with circle time. The students were relatively young, curious\
  \ about their new teacher and excited to learn English. As the children returned\
  \ to their seats, one girl slyly ran her index finger along my left arm.  I kindly\
  \ said hi and watched as a look of surprise came across her face when she realized\
  \ her hands were still the same color. The power of exposure.\n\nAs months passed,\
  \ I became more comfortable exploring the city. I met more people who wanted to\
  \ learn about me. I could easily pick up on the phrase \u201CNi Hao. N\u01D0 c\xF3\
  ng n\u01CEl\u01D0 l\xE1i\u201D and respond proudly saying \u201CM\u011Bigu\xF3\u201D\
  . The same look of surprise would appear which was almost always followed by \u201C\
  Obama\u201D or \"Kobe\u201D. \n\nWhile sites like the Great Wall are awe striking\
  \ and the dim sum is tasty, it's the day to day encounters I find are often taken\
  \ for granted. That final rejection email was a blessing in disguise. The experience\
  \ gave me the sweet realization that my presence had broadened someone\u2019s perspective\
  \ of American traveler and the sour realization that there continue to be misconceptions\
  \ about the world and the people in it but through continued exposure we add to\
  \ the imagery that colors our world."
