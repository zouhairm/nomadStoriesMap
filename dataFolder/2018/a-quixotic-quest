Text: "My pleasantly loquacious driver, Danten, had suddenly fallen quiet. His nonstop\
  \ gibberish about the amusing tales of ex passengers had kept me entertained. Bumpy\
  \ rough roads of NH129A to the inconspicuous village of Willong Khullen could not\
  \ have been the reason. Seeing an army check post in the distance he suddenly started\
  \ smiling again. The lonely road with densely forested slopes was apparently making\
  \ him skittish owing to Manipur\u2019s tumultuous past. \u201CAre you a journalist?\u201D\
  \ asked one of the soliders. On my reply, they seemed bemused with the concept of\
  \ someone being a travel writer. Only when I showed a few articles of mine in the\
  \ mobile, I got a much needed smile from their face and they allowed me to move\
  \ on. Willong Khullen is a small village on the border of Manipur and Nagaland.\
  \ Just at the entrance of this road lie rows of vertical stone slabs in various\
  \ shapes and sizes surrounded by barbed wires. These peculiar monoliths in the backdrop\
  \ of the verdant green hills look like guarding sentinels of the modest settlement\
  \ determined to intrigue visitors with no history of their builders and no story\
  \ for the reason of their existence. One can\u2019t help but draw a comparison with\
  \ the world famous megaliths (and monoliths) in England and France. Like, Willong\
  \ Khullen, these also have always perplexed historians and scientists. \u201CThese\
  \ are were built in the memories of the tribe warriors\u201D, said Nomyank Lechung,\
  \ a village elder, seemingly putting an end to all speculations. Others, however,\
  \ don\u2019t agree. Many of the villagers consider these as holy spirits which come\
  \ alive at night. As per them, counting the monoliths is not possible as the spirits\
  \ forbid it. Ironically, it is actually very confusing to count them because of\
  \ their irregular positions with respect to each other. There is always the chance\
  \ of repetition. However, few unconfirmed reports estimate the number at 135. \u201C\
  Back in our days, this was the hub of all social activities. The entire village\
  \ gathered here for cultural programs, traditional dances and other customary practices\
  \ which made the bonding stronger. Sadly, this practice is fading away and most\
  \ of the times the center is locked due to lack of activities,\u201D observed Eneko,\
  \ a village elder. , I got many questions from the folks enquiring about my background,\
  \ origin and purpose of visit. My camera fascinated them the most.  People here,\
  \ though with feeble means of livelihood seem very content and happy."
