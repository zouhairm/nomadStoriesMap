Text: "After 7 days it was time to head back home. I recalled the warnings that we\
  \ had been issued by every single person with whom we had shared our trip plans.\
  \ They made it sound like we were willingly putting ourselves in danger by travelling\
  \ to a terrorist state. I consciously noticed every single incident reported by\
  \ the media related to Kashmir. Were the warnings warranted? At the end after a\
  \ quick reassurance from our driver in Kashmir, I bit the bullet and booked those\
  \ aeroplane tickets. There was no turning back after that. \n\nIn today\u2019s age\
  \ of WhatsApp and Twitter news has become more accessible, but just as dangerous.\
  \ It is as fast to spread misinformation, as it is to benefit from these modern\
  \ technologies. On the day that we had arrived in Kashmir, the internet had been\
  \ shut down for 2 days to prevent this very problem. Our driver told us that despite\
  \ the inconvenience, it was a good move on the part of the government. This really\
  \ meant that the locals were aware of the ground reality.\n\nThe days we spent here\
  \ were some of the best times I have had on a vacation. Media and politics have\
  \ absolutely destroyed the livelihood of so many locals that rely on tourism. The\
  \ warmth we felt here from the locals was genuine. They want nothing more than peace\
  \ for their state. The acts of a few nefarious elements have unfortunately come\
  \ to represent the nature of all its people. \n\nKashmir is often labelled a terrorist\
  \ state with its people portrayed as having a propensity for instigating chaos and\
  \ unrest. Nothing could be farther from the truth. In a tourist-driven economy,\
  \ they want nothing more than to make tourists feel safe. That anyone would willingly\
  \ do something to jeopardize this is unthinkable.\n\nKashmir is a place of breath-taking\
  \ natural beauty. It's snow-capped mountains and spectacular slopes could easily\
  \ rival those from Switzerland. It\u2019s little wonder why everyone fights to retain\
  \ control over it. Despite everything you may hear on TV or the internet, it\u2019\
  s a place, every Indian must visit once in their lives. I advised everyone who has\
  \ asked me since about travelling to Kashmir if it was safe. I told them in the\
  \ 7 days I spent there, I was more likely to lose my life in a road accident in\
  \ my own city, than from anything that happens in Kashmir."
