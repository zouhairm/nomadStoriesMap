Text: "VENICE OF The EAST \u2013  UDAIPUR \u2013 \n(\u2018KHAMMA GHANI SA\u2019) \u2013\
  \ Lots of Blessings- Grandiose  welcome by my Rajputana host family at Venice of\
  \ the East \u2013 Udaipur \u2013 truly a magical mystical city in India.\nThere\u2019\
  s something in the air, mesmerizing me and reconnecting from my past birth.  This\
  \ three day journey was the best part of my India trip from Barcelona. I wanted\
  \ to explore each & every part of the city with some local connections and  enchanting\
  \ memories to cherish forever in my heart and soul. \nFrom attending the traditional\
  \ cookery classes to the infectious rhythm of \u2018Ghoomar\u2019 dance, rich cultural\
  \ heritage, the marvellous city teemed with movement of beauty, serenity and a real\
  \ miracle of creative genius.\nVisiting Rajputana forts, resplendent temples, serene\
  \ lakes, romantic sun sets and above all ochre and green ridges of the wooden Aravali\
  \ hills wrapping the city in its arm like a green blanket.\nMy itinerary was deftly\
  \ juxtaposed by Anita, my host friend \u2013 who made my connections more deep rooted\
  \ with the city.  Anita taught me delicious Rajasthani cuisine \u2013 Daal baati\
  \ churma , chutney, all served with pure ghee and sprinkled with love and warmth.\
  \ In Anita\u2019s joint family each member was blessed with some distinctive talent.\
  \ Knowledge of Ayurveda to Yoga, tie and dye, intricate paintings on wall all had\
  \ their own stories.\nFestival of holi celebrated with enthusiasm and enchanting\
  \ splash of colours ,just like \u2018Tomatina\u2019 in Barcelona, the streets were\
  \ filled with colours and greetings and above all sweet delicacies-Jalebi.\nI was\
  \ truly blessed to attend \u2018Gangaur\u2019 festival \u2013 celebrated in honour\
  \ of Goddess Gauri ,celebrating love & marriage. Anita taught me how to apply heena\
  \ (mehendi ).  My painting classes tie and dye scarves, shopping local souvenirs\
  \ & Rajasthani artefacts from lanes and bazaars for my friends and Mom in Barcelona.\n\
  Entire trip was really worthy with priceless memories etched in my heart. Anita's\
  \ family and their congeniality made me feel like a member of their community. \
  \ \nIt was time to be bid adieu to this beautiful city with heavy heart and a promise\
  \ of coming back. Anita and her family bid me adieu with \u2018Padharjo Sa\u2019\
  \ gesture. Looking forward to visiting this place again and collect more memories."
