Text: "To me, Amer sounded as Amor or Amore. It sounded as beloved or love or the\
  \ beginning. The beginning of love, then. Perhaps, the love between me and this\
  \ subcontinent that only exists on the map in in this same, very world.\n\nOr his\
  \ love. \nYou can barely feel the absence of mine.\n\nAmer, as that long, right,\
  \ straight and black, wild length which smells as gas and tires, and only sometimes,\
  \ as the lake on which shore he played croquet and hunted tigers twenty years ago.\n\
  \nAs amber, when wind makes a mistake and hurls toward the kingdom of people and\
  \ monkeys, rarely good under this Sun.\n\nAnd as his ''you are this song''.\n\n\
  You are the song.\n\nI close my eyes and picture the planet rotating and Asia in\
  \ on it, then India, then the path, then us, then my hands, then pulse. Pause. Then\
  \ faith. Zero fucks given. Then freedom. Thought. Trust.\n\nFrom all the addresses\
  \ in the world, this one appeared the most natural for the universe growing in my\
  \ head. And even when I arrived here, sometimes it seemed to me that I was a premature\
  \ baby cuddled into someone's illusion, and I just could not manage to realize -\
  \ the illusion of whom? This life I wanted - to whom it belonged? \n\nOh, India.\n\
  \nIndia is not to be seen on photos or movies. It does not exist anywhere but here,\
  \ where I am now. Here. The sky sticks sometimes, and it can be so dense that I\
  \ can barely read my own thoughts, then, as a blind man, I stick the stones down\
  \ the paths I don't know, so I won't stumble more than I already did. Just as Corto\
  \ Maltese and all those marvelous people of the boat, I am trying to carve the line\
  \ in my palm and I do not fear any blade. I fear of the dullness, the bloodstreams\
  \ are only welcome. \n\nOh, I fell in love in India. \nI fell in love with India.\
  \ \n\nI didn't always want to wait for all of these days, but all of them wanted\
  \ to wait for me. It is not to be put into words.\n\nMidnight talk, soft materials\
  \ and two religions praising one god.\n\nI plugged youth in the wind, trusting Indian,\
  \ whom I know just as long to feel that I will trust him one day, but that he will\
  \ write me tomorrow and I won't be able to explain him, so I will lie how freedom\
  \ is a regular thing in my world. I opened my eyes and realized how the thing that\
  \ wind sends me off with in the night ain't stink and I am not bothered with it\
  \ anymore. I realized that I decomposed the wind into notes as strings of guitar\
  \ and I carry it everywhere. It is not sadness nor plague, but semiprecious stone.\
  \ India."
