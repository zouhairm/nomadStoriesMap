Text: "I hum whilst having a sip of Balinese coffee.I stare at the grounds at the\
  \ bottom of my cup, waiting for them to tell me something.I place the cup upside\
  \ down.\"Why did Matt have to tell me this before my Christmas holiday?\" \nI couldn\u2019\
  t blame him. I couldn\u2019t have blamed anyone other than my lack of diplomacy.\
  \ I just wished I had more time. It was the end of my holiday. I turn my cup up\
  \ and stare inside.\u201CI have no clue what it means\u201D!\nI boarded my flight\
  \ to Denpasar on a Friday afternoon. I had been constantly tracking volcanic activities\
  \ over the past week.The Girls trip was now a solo trip.\nI make my way through\
  \ the taxi area after kindly refusing twenty chauffeur deals and a marriage proposal.I\
  \ manage to book a car.\nBy the time I arrive at my destination, rain is coming\
  \ down in torrents. I agreed with my host to wait for me at the car park and show\
  \ me the way. 12 AM myself and three dogs are waiting in the dark. By 2 AM I manage\
  \ to check in elsewhere. The fatigue is starting to weight on my shoulders, but\
  \ I am too excited to go to sleep. I open a beer and sit on the porch, listening\
  \ to the rain.\nThe next day I take a cold shower, not that I had any other option,\
  \ and head out. My destination was 'Eat Pray Love' Padang Beach. I make my way through\
  \ villages and humidity.A playful pup joins me for a while. I reach the beach but\
  \ to my disappointment Bardem doesn't show up.I decide to climb the rock close to\
  \ the water. I reach the top and notice a Hindu altar. I sit in front of it trying\
  \ to reenact the middle part of \u2018Eat, Pray, Love\u2019. I close my eyes. That\u2019\
  s when Matt\u2019s words come back to me unwelcomed \u201CWe are forced to make\
  \ this decision\u201D.\u2018F*ck you Matt!\u2019 I kick the thought away and agree\
  \ that\u2019s enough praying for the day.The way back seems even longer.I call my\
  \ mum and tell her about the day. I keep to myself the fact I might lose my job\
  \ and visa. She doesn\u2019t need to worry.\nThe rain subjugated the whole island\
  \ the next days. I'm asked what I want for breakfast. \u201CBalinese coffee and\
  \ pancakes, please\u201D!I hear my phone ring.It\u2019s Matt. He promised he\u2019\
  d check in with me about the final decision.\"We are good, for now, we are giving\
  \ you more time. I wanted to let you know this before Christmas\u201D.\nI open an\
  \ excel file. A1 leave B1 stay pro&con. The return to Sydney is not easy, neither\
  \ is the one back to work.At 5 PM I close all my spreadsheets.\nI open Chrome and\
  \ type in a web address.\u2018Visa application ready\u2019 appears in front of my\
  \ eyes. I choose B1. I click submit."
