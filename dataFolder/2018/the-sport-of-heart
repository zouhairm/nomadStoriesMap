Text: "We were tied but the volatility of the game could have given even the most\
  \ experienced football player goosebumps.The number of Bloody knees and scuffed\
  \ elbows outnumbered us because The field was made of dirt, But that didn't stop\
  \ us. Football is a sport that can be played anytime anywhere no matter the circumstances.\
  \ \n\nOnly in Argentina and can you be one-moment drinking yerba mate having a calm\
  \ evening then afterward be enjoying a traditional Asado while feasting upon a glorious\
  \ choripan with chimichurri and then be playing a game of soccer.\n\nWhile wandering\
  \ about Buenos Aires and its surroundings. Considering I was a foreigner and unfamiliar\
  \ with my surroundings in this country. I had accidentally mistaken martin him to\
  \ be of Uruguayan descent while asking for directions to the nearest hostel. He\
  \ expressed his discontent with that mix up profusely and explained to me the difference\
  \ between the two countries.\nAfter the mixup, we ended up having similar interests\
  \ and in his gracious hospitality he offered to\nMeet up with me so that he could\
  \ show me a day in the life of Argentina. In my wildest dreams, I would have ever\
  \ imagined I'd experiencing Argentina it through the eyes of a local.\n\nAnd Although\
  \ we were strangers at first we soon bonded over many things one of which was soccer.\
  \ He was a soccer prodigy since a young age something that isn't taken lightly in\
  \ Argentina. For this reason, He boasted that he was more skilled than me and that\
  \ a foreigner like me could not ever beat him in a match. I took that as a challenge\
  \ and soon we made our way to the nearest football field.\n\n\u201CVos jugas bien\
  \ por ser un gringo \u201D Martin said to me with a laugh he made fun of my latent\
  \ talent although I haven't played since I was a kid. \n\n\u201CSolo cuando tengo\
  \ que ganar. \u201D I said to him in my broken Spanish  \n\nAs the game was about\
  \ to be over anyone watching could tell that we were both on the same level I thought\
  \ I was a goner since my energy was just about depleted and he looked like he could\
  \ play for hours on end. The only way to decide was with penalties \n\nI walked\
  \ out to the penalty area holding not but a soccer ball in my hands and determination\
  \ in my head. The game was just about done. sweat ran down my neck.i kicked the\
  \ ball and thought of only where it needed to go. The back of the net.\n\n\u201C\
  GOAL\u201D I exclaimed and looked at Martin he couldn't believe it but he knew why\
  \ he lost. He broke an unsaid rule in soccer \n\nYou don't play with your feet you\
  \ play with your heart."
