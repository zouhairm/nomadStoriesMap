Text: "My experience in Marrakesh was an extraordinary awakening of the senses. This\
  \ Moroccan city is full of life and seems like a place where time is deeply enjoying\
  \ his hours.\nAs interesting the souks, the gardens, the museums and the food was,\
  \ the people were fascinating.\nThe people in Marrakech have in the evening all\
  \ sorts of preoccupations that involve socializing with friends and family mostly\
  \ outside, in shops, restaurants or bars and strangely enough they seem as happy\
  \ and entertained as people usually are in these situations, although their evenings\
  \ don't include alcohol.\nThe Medina has more of the traditional features preserving\
  \ buildings and customs and the people are focused on everything touristic, souks,\
  \ restaurants, accommodation so on and so forth. Outside of its walls is where you\
  \ get to see people with other more everyday jobs, you see the banks and business\
  \ buildings as well as the less developed parts of the city. And if you were wondering\
  \ how safe one feels on the streets of Marrakesh, I'll say that in the Medina people\
  \ seem friendlier than in other parts of the city. If you find yourself on a street\
  \ where people give you surprised faces is because you're lost and tourists are\
  \ not often seen crossing those streets. In such situation more often than not a\
  \ young man may ask you where you're heading and then offer to guide you, in exchange\
  \ for some money off course. I was always accompanied at last by my boyfriend and\
  \ I don't know how it is for a woman traveling alone but I do believe is helpful\
  \ to show some respect for the culture and wear appropriate clothing.\nYou might\
  \ think that I discourage you from going outside the Medina and into the new part\
  \ of the city, but on the contrary, I really believe that one should see both parts.\
  \ \nThe new part of the city has all the shops that we know and the women there\
  \ enjoy shopping as much as everywhere in the world. Taking a stroll around those\
  \ shops is where I discovered some embarrassing misconceptions that I had. Muslim\
  \ women, in spite of what we may think, can be some true fashionistas and when shopping\
  \ they surely know what they want. They ask the staff questions, compare and don't\
  \ shy away from bold stuff even when in a lingerie shop.\nAll in all Marrakesh is\
  \ already back on my travel list and as much as I would like to convince you how\
  \ extraordinary this place is, I believe this is a connection that everyone should\
  \ experience by themselves."
