Text: "There is a bear between us and the boats. Not a shy, cute black bear but a\
  \ huge Alaskan coastal brown bear, bigger by a third than their grizzly neighbors.\
  \ And not just any big brownie\u2014 this is Clawdius (with a \u201Cw\u201D), the\
  \ macho alpha-male, probably pushing half a ton. Last summer, he chewed through\
  \ our Zodiac boat and left a big pile of bear poop in the middle of the wreckage.\
  \ Now he\u2019s sitting on the beach between us and and the boats\u2014 and there\u2019\
  s a tourist walking right toward him.\n   This is Glacier Point, Alaska: a bulge\
  \ of land in the waterlogged fjord just outside the towns of Haines and Skagway.\
  \ Home to bears, moose, myself, nine other guides and the magnificent Davidson glacier.\
  \ Every summer, cruise ships disgorge thousands of tourists a day into the tiny\
  \ towns, where Glacier Point is just one of the tour options. Guests arrive by speedboat;\
  \ we canoe them to the glacier. We often see bears, but not between us and the boats\
  \ back to Skagway.\n    Forty tourists push past us. Every guide wonders what they\u2019\
  d do in this kind of situation.\n\u201CEveryone stay together, let\u2019s give him\
  \ plenty of space!\u201D But cruise ships make everyplace feel like a zoo; a woman\
  \ in a blue jacket begins walking towards the wild bear, snapping away on her cell\
  \ phone. \u201CMa'am, stay with the group! Ma\u2019am!\u201D She\u2019s shuffling\
  \ forward, the bear existing only on her iPhone screen.\nClawdius gets to his feet.\
  \ It\u2019s an awesome sight: a thousand pounds of one of the largest land predators\
  \ on earth turning to face us. The tourists titter and snap. You think watching\
  \ a bear stand would be terrifying enough but what he does next nearly stops my\
  \ heart. Clawdius sets his jaw and swells out his shoulders, exactly like a bodybuilder\
  \ flexing. Ohmygodohmygod he\u2019s going to charge and then total panic and tourists\
  \ climbing over each other and a huge bear running through\u2026\nTalking to the\
  \ tourists isn\u2019t working, so I start talking to Clawdius, \u201CHey bear! Hey!\
  \ Go away!\u201D The other guides start shouting too. Clawdius looks surprised,\
  \ distracted. The tourists join in, \u201CHey bear, hey bear!\u201D Clawdius is\
  \ looking at all of us now. This is the moment\u2014 he\u2019s either going to charge\
  \ or retreat.\n\u201CAll together\u2014 now!\u201D\nWe all inhale, \u201CHEY BEAR!\u201D\
  \nClawdius takes a step back; it\u2019s like we\u2019ve morphed into one very big\
  \ bear. Another step, then he turns and jogs down the beach, looking over his shoulder.\
  \ The tourists cheer and the woman in the blue jacket finally rejoins the group,\
  \ \u201CAw, why\u2019ja have to scare him away?\u201D"
