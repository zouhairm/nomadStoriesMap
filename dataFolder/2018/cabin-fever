Text: "As you\u2019re reading this your #MCM is using some meaningful quote as the\
  \ caption to the third gym selfie he\u2019s posted this week. \n\n\u201CLife is\
  \ journey. Not a destination.\u201D This was most likely in reference to his #gainz,\
  \ but it makes a good point.  \n\nNobody wants to #wanderlust that 36-hour lay over\
  \ or the funky smell coming from the back of the bus, but every now and then the\
  \ journey can offer us more than the destination ever could.  \n\nIt was the fall\
  \ of 2017, and from the moment the plane took off, the infant seated in the row\
  \ behind me had declared, \u201CThis was going to be a bumpy flight.\u201D Throughout\
  \ the first hour this pint-sized pirate would pay homage to Shakespeare\u2019s infamous\
  \ line, \u201Cthou she be but little, she be fierce.\u201D By hour two, our tiny\
  \ tyrant would boldly protest against her mother\u2019s attempts to eradicate her\
  \ first amendment rights. And by hour three, rumors of a potential exorcism began\
  \ spreading across the cabin. \n\nWe had all but given up hope when suddenly, silence.\
  \ Our contender had finally fallen dormant in her mother\u2019s lap- TKO! The passengers\
  \ in the surrounding rows exchanged silent celebrations as the smell of victory\
  \ filled the air. \n\nHowever, unbeknownst to the cabin, her two-year-old brother\
  \ had different plans.  \u201CPotty!\u201D he screeched. \u201CPotty NOW!\u201D\
  \ \n\nI glared between the seats to catch a look at the vile gremlin that had threatened\
  \ our newly found serenity. That\u2019s when I saw her- the mother. Her eyes lament\
  \ with exhaustion as she desperately plead with the toddler. \u201CNot now.\u201D\
  \n\nAnd it hit me- this mother was not on this flight by choice. She wasn\u2019\
  t heading to a 5-star vacation and she was definitely not flying alone with two\
  \ children under the age of three because #YOLO. We had spent the last hours cursing\
  \ this woman to high hell while she had been living in it.\n\nNow I still can\u2019\
  t quite explain what happened next, but suddenly I was standing in the middle of\
  \ the aisle, staring down a total stranger, and the words just fell out of my mouth.\n\
  \n\u201CGive me the baby.\u201D\n\nLet me just take a second to clarify, it\u2019\
  s not in my common practice to randomly demand babies from their mothers. But in\
  \ that moment, like comrades in battle, we shared a connection, and without a second\
  \ thought, she stood up and slammed that baby on my chest.\n\nHours later we would\
  \ land and go our separate ways. I would never see her again, I would never even\
  \ get her name, but I'll never forget what I learned that day. \n\nOur destinations\
  \ may be the same, but our journeys are not."
