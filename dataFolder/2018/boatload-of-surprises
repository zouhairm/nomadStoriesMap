Text: "Final\nEating 0.60$ Pad Thai on a side street in Bangkok, was one of the last\
  \ places I imagined receiving travel advice.   But in a 5 min whirl of conversation,\
  \ with a randomly seated Kiwi traveler, my plan to go to Ha long bay was cemented.\
  \ Hanoi would be the base camp, with trecks north to mountains and east to the water.\
  \ Although even the thought of this plan made me wince, knowing how much of this\
  \ beautiful country I was sacrificing to the south.\nHanoi traffic is crazy from\
  \ my western perspective, where caution in crossing the street was actually to your\
  \ detriment. You just have to commit to crossing and then follow through. The motorbikes\
  \ will naturally snake around you. Amazing, scary and easy all at the same time.\
  \ This intricate traffic dance is worth every second once you get to the local spot\
  \ serving Bun Bo Nam Bo. Side note, go to Sapa! \nI took an overnight train to Sapa\
  \ both ways, in order to maximize my time in this mountainous paradise.  Traversing\
  \ through rice fields with with my \"guide\" and two German travelers was one of\
  \ the supreme highlights of Asia for me. We talked of family, bamboo trees, Cuban\
  \ coffee and much more. We even jumped together in cold rivers and had tea in the\
  \ guide's home after the tour. Seeing remote waterfalls while twisting through the\
  \ mountains (that boarder China) at sunset on a motorcycle; wasn't a bad day two\
  \ either. Next up, Ha long bay. \nI was told that it would be packed with tourists\
  \ but the overnight boat trip to this bay was majestic.  And it was both! I was\
  \ immediately surrounded with the Vietnamese language upon entering the shuttle\
  \ heading west, being the only one of two \"foreigners.\" Eventually ending on up\
  \ on a boat that showed me some of the wonders of Vietnam. Although the kayaking\
  \ and sunset were lovely. It was the company I kept that will stay with me. Skipping\
  \ the normal niceties, the head of the boat and I jumped into full friendship. He\
  \ told me of his father ( a north Vietnamese general) and I told him about my grandfather\
  \ (who fled Cuba in 1962). We talked about life in intimate ways. When I asked why\
  \ there were so many local \"tourists,\" he stated it was Independence Day. Independence\
  \ from whom, I asked.  \"You.\"   \nWhen all others on the ship retired to their\
  \ cabins, I remaind with him and the crew in the galley, eating squid that stained\
  \ our hands, smoking the traditional pipe while drinking warm wine that brought\
  \ this whole wonderful experience together.  It's so lovely to learn in this fashion!"
