Text: "My footsteps creak as I stand upon a fallen leaf, and I grimace at how loud\
  \ the noise is. I breathe and take a look around; hoping that the flashlight on\
  \ my head will enable me to pick up some eye shine off any animals out there in\
  \ the jungle. I pause to think. It\u2019s quarter past nine, totally pitch black\
  \ and I\u2019m stood in the middle of the Amazon rainforest; hundreds of miles away\
  \ from the nearest \u2018proper\u2019 civilization.\n\nI\u2019ve been feeling on\
  \ edge for the last half an hour so far. Myself and my companion on this night walk,\
  \ Stijn, have so far found massive scorpion spiders, several poisonous dart frogs\
  \ and a tree that has been leaking a lot of sap, giving it the impression that some\
  \ large mammal has been slaughtered at the bottom of the tree.\n \n\u201CPuma!!\u201D\
  \ Stijn shouts in a whispered voice, as I turn to see where he is pointing. I catch\
  \ the yellow-orange eye shine as I turn. A puma is the last thing I expected to\
  \ see tonight. My headtorch is off almost immediately and being held to the side\
  \ of my face so that I can get rid of the eyeshine and see the cat properly. It\u2019\
  s standing there, looking directly at us, only 10 metres off the trail.\nNot thinking\
  \ twice, we run towards it. I suddenly think that this is rather irrational. I have\
  \ come face to face with a cat that weighs nearly as much as I do, has razor-sharp\
  \ claws that could pull my intestines out in only a few seconds. Pumas, like all\
  \ cats, are obligate carnivores; meaning that they feed exclusively on meat. I hope\
  \ it\u2019s not interested in human tonight.\nBut wow, it\u2019s a wild Puma! And\
  \ I\u2019d love to get a better view of it. I lift my gaze from the ground to look\
  \ back at it. My inexperience of the jungle shows here, as I need to look where\
  \ I\u2019m going instead of focussing on what\u2019s in front of me. It\u2019s still\
  \ there, but only just. I get about 2m further, look up again, and it has gone.\
  \ It\u2019s sunken off into the depths of the jungle, leaving me with my heart racing\
  \ and full of admiration for this beautiful creature.\n\nI scan around, looking\
  \ in all directions for any sign of it. I cannot believe that a cat that was so\
  \ big and so close to me can disappear into the jungle just like that. But then\
  \ Pumas are the queens of the jungle. They are solitary animals, only meeting to\
  \ mate. \n\u201CThat was so cool!\u201D Stijn puffs as we walk back to the trail.\
  \ I agree whilst smiling in amazement. We\u2019re only 2 hours into this night walk.\
  \ With at least an hour back to camp, there\u2019s still plenty of time to see more\
  \ of the jungle at night."
