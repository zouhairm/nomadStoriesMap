Text: "This story of my life which exactly happened as a miracle started last year\
  \ 2017, when I finally finished my Post Graduate Diploma and thought of going to\
  \ Mumbai from Kolkata, and another  intention of migrating to Mumbai was  a hope\
  \ in my heart to find work there but the stumbling block which prevented me from\
  \ doing anything in life was my drug abuse. I tried quite several times to quit\
  \ the habit of smoking drugs in my hometown but in vain,  later I found out that\
  \ it was because of the comfort zone.  So finally last year February I moved to\
  \ Mumbai and somehow found an accommodation though didn't get any job. The paying\
  \ guest apartment was on Sharing basis and all the occupants were employed. Every\
  \ morning all of them would go out for office leaving me behind alone and this continued\
  \ for sometime. Life was getting frustrated and hopeless in a new city though now\
  \ I have reduced my drug use as because something struck me.  Until one day I called\
  \ up local AA ( Alcoholics Anonymous)  meetings and one evening went to attend their\
  \ meeting.  It was life changing experience as from that day onwards I took a vow\
  \ of staying clean. \nWhen the meetings ended the members introduced me to Mr Mannilal\
  \ Bhai who has been clean and sober for over sixteen years and who coincidentally\
  \ resided stayed in my locality where I was staying in Mumbai. Immediately I made\
  \ a local connection and from that day onwards Mr Mannilal became my guiding force\
  \ in recovery.  In the mornings I would straight head towards his small factory,\
  \  and I was no more left alone in a new city.  After finishing his work at factory\
  \ he would go to the main city to sell his tools and I would accompany him with\
  \ my camera and explored Mumbai and while returning home we would regularly attend\
  \ the AA meetings.  This is how I met a gem of a person in Mumbai and in his sixty\
  \ years of experience he shared the nostalgia of the city with me along with his\
  \ own struggles with alcoholism, gaining a livelihood in Mumbai and so many other\
  \ stories......"
