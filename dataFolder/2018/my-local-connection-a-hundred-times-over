Text: "It took all of ten seconds to fall in love with that city. I said these words\
  \ to myself a few hours after arriving in Paris, and have said it at least once\
  \ a week since. Almost every time I close my eyes I can smell the coffee and warm\
  \ croissants on the cold rainy mornings, and it takes a little more than just a\
  \ heartbeat to let the nostalgia waft over me. Although, if a place gives you an\
  \ underground tunnel laden with skulls, the most famous painting in the world at\
  \ a distance of six feet, and Disneyland all in itself, it deserves a special place\
  \ in your heart.\nHaving been born to a merchant navy captain and a travel buff,\
  \ the need to explore new places, I believe, has been hardwired into my DNA. Right\
  \ from school trips and summer camp in the mountains, solo trips to the ancient\
  \ architectural wonders of India like Hampi, all the way to ultra-modernized places\
  \ like Rome and Singapore, I feel incredibly blessed to have traveled far and wide.\
  \ I have yet to find a place as mesmerizing as Paris though. \nIf you\u2019ve ever\
  \ wondered why this city has been romanticized so richly, I suggest you stop wondering,\
  \ and implore you to find a way to get yourself there. The moment I stepped off\
  \ of the tram onto Brancion station, where I was AirBnb-ing, I was welcomed by a\
  \ broad and beautiful street, with a sidewalk kissed with golden brown leaves. \
  \ During a five minute walk to my apartment, I saw a couple kissing on the street,\
  \ a teenage girl walking her dog and a gigantic outdoor book sale in a nearby park,\
  \ all of which seemed to be radiating the same vibe of unadulterated love.\nI made\
  \ more local connections in four days in France than I have in the other twenty\
  \ something years of my life. My connection isn\u2019t singular though. It\u2019\
  s with the entire city. From the proprietor of the little sandwich shop right across\
  \ my apartment that served me the best burger I\u2019ve ever had, the simultaneous\
  \ feelings of abundance and insignificance standing atop the Eiffel tower, the overwhelming\
  \ vibrations of rich culture and art walking through the Louvre and the Palace of\
  \ Versailles, the strange lady who give me an incredibly hearty smile on the subway,\
  \ to the star spangled Gucci stores and Lamborghinis beautifully merged with the\
  \ humbly joyful expressions of the streams of citizens sipping midday wine at the\
  \ cafes at Champs-\xC9lys\xE9es, every nook and cranny of this wonderful city took\
  \ a piece of my heart and shot fireworks across my mind, the sounds of which have\
  \ since been gladly borne."
