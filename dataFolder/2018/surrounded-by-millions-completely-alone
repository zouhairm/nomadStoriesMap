Text: "Covered in scrapes and bruises, soaked in sweat, bat guano in my ears and between\
  \ my toes, I emerged from the cave defeated. Quivering with frustration like a toddler\
  \ having a tantrum, I whimpered with helplessness. We were only halfway there.\n\
  \nAccessible by propeller plane, I was eager to deviate from the beaten path to\
  \ visit the remote Gunung Mulu National Park in Borneo, home to some of the most\
  \ impressive caves on Earth. \n\nDressed in pink running shorts and old sneakers,\
  \ armed with my headlamp, I stood at the mouth of Deer Cave, one of the largest\
  \ cave passages in the world, brimming with eagerness to begin the two kilometre\
  \ hike through it. Entering the main chamber, three million Wrinkle-lipped bats\
  \ hung overhead, the ambiance of their squeaking like the white noise of a crowded\
  \ stadium. The vastness of the chamber was humbling; the cave could swallow me whole.\
  \ \n\nSuddenly, my feet shot out from under me. The rock I\u2019d stepped on was\
  \ covered in guano. The sneakers that had withstood volcano treks and waterfall\
  \ climbs were failing me, and I snatched the air in vain for something to hold on\
  \ to. My headlamp flickered and went out, leaving me with only my cell phone light\
  \ to guide me. I tucked it into my sports bra, keeping both hands free to break\
  \ my repeated falls, acutely aware of how ridiculous I looked. \n\nMounds of guano\
  \ surrounded me, \u201Ctall enough to snowboard down,\u201D our guide laughed. I\
  \ shone my light towards the nearest pile and recoiled; the guano was moving. \n\
  \n\u201COver time, the guano has accumulated allowing its own unique ecosystem to\
  \ develop, filled with millions of insects.\u201D\n\nThe stagnant heat and humidity\
  \ were crushing, as if an invisible giant was clutching me in his fist. I could\
  \ almost taste the smell of ammonia emanating from the guano. \n\nI stumbled out\
  \ into the sunlight, grief-stricken that the only way back was the way I had come.\n\
  \nBut the longer I stood there, the wonder and readiness I\u2019d felt entering\
  \ the chamber for the first time bubbled up and began to fuel me.\n \nI swelled\
  \ with relief as I neared the end, but felt melancholic, too. Gloomy, like the day\
  \ after a holiday when the shine of the occasion wears off. I\u2019d pushed myself\
  \ beyond what I thought my limits were. \n\nPost-trek, my hands wrapped around a\
  \ cup of hot chocolate, I waited for the bats to exit the cave for their nightly\
  \ feed. I basked in my exhaustion, an emblem of my accomplishment, as other travelers\
  \ buzzed with small talk, waiting in anticipation of the scene to come."
