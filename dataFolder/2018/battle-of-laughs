Text: "I am coming back from a 6 months trip in the bush. 6 months isolated, only\
  \ with the song of the forest, rain, heat, animals, and sunsets on the Niger river.\
  \ Feeling me extremely priviledged to have made this journey. After a long trip\
  \ on a \"bush track\" (i.e. a track where you need more than 6 hours in a four-wheel\
  \ drive to travel 15 kilometers), I reach Faranah. The \"brouhaha\" of this little\
  \ town keeps me going and I cross the village market as if I were on another planet.\
  \ Shelves of meats dried by sun, chickens in rabbit's boxes, chinese gadgets, tissues\
  \ stamped \"from Mali\" (in Guinea everything is from somewhere else), coffee drink\
  \ sold in plastic bag, unknown fruits, etc. I buy something to eat : chicken skewers\
  \ with peanut sauce, perhaps I would be ill but it changes from rice and gravy.\
  \ Suddenly, my photographic eye is catching by a big paint on a sheet. That represents\
  \ a sort of God medicine. But not current medicine. Medicine by plants. I can see\
  \ a tall woman with long dark hair, surrounded by a huge snake, treating all the\
  \ organs of the human body with different plants. I would like to take a picture\
  \ of this frame. Showing both my camera and the painting to a woman close by, I\
  \ receive her silent approval with a blink of eyes and a nod. I am preparing to\
  \ lock on the target when an old man goes out from nowhere, yelling at me. STOP\
  \ SHOOTING THIS! STOP SHOOTING THIS! I KNOW YOU SHOOT THIS HERE AND THEN YOU SELL\
  \ IT IN YOUR COUNTRY! \n\nShocked, I do not know exactly how to calm him down. He\
  \ gets very angry and is still screaming. I gabble apologies and try to explain\
  \ that I wanted to take a \"souvenir\" and no more, but he does not listen to me\
  \ at all. I have a look around, looking for help, but nobody is watching us. On\
  \ the floor, there is a lot of bottles filled with plant medicine. If he protects\
  \ the painting of the plant witch, he should be the owner of these potions. Shaking\
  \ my finger at the bottles, I say straight out : do you know \"fassak\xE9m\xE9\"\
  ? Like a sunbeam through clouds, a large smile appears on his face and he says after\
  \ me, like an echo :  you know \"fassak\xE9m\xE9\"! You know \"fassak\xE9m\xE9\"\
  ! He smiles more and more and we start to laught together. After that he takes me\
  \ in his arm, we take seelfies together, other people come, and we take \"souvenir\"\
  \ all together. He says : you will send me the picture ! I say : yes ! And we talk\
  \ about this liana which made us friends.\n\n\"Fassak\xE9m\xE9\" is a liana from\
  \ the guinean forest which is used for treat every disease."
