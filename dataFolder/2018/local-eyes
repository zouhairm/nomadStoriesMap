Text: "I have always strongly felt that one does not see a country or place unless\
  \ they are interacting with the culture and people around them. When you experience\
  \ it all through local eyes, everything becomes more enriching and more alive. I\
  \ was 22 years old and living in a small single bedroom apartment not far from Naviglio\
  \ Grande: the larger river of the two that is comprised of several wonderful little\
  \ shops and aperitivo restaurants. Being of Italian heritage and now a local of\
  \ Milan, I set out to assimilate into a culture that became more than a nationality,\
  \ but a symbol of beauty, friendship, hospitality, awkwardness, and the essence\
  \ of living in the moment. Through careful observation, I bought new clothes,  changed\
  \ my hairstyle, my diet included more carbs, and I studied the Italian language\
  \ daily. I wanted nothing less than a full immersion. The only problem was, how\
  \ would I make friends with locals when I barely spoke the language. Yes, this was\
  \ intimidating, but the mere thought of passing up this rare opportunity motivated\
  \ me to vulnerably put myself out there. \n\n\u201CRing\u201D \u201CRing\u201D \u201C\
  Michael, this is Carmela from the Wind cell phone store. You forgot your U.S. sim\
  \ card\u201D. Stricken from jet lag and hardly awake, I was not making the connection.\
  \ After a few seconds, I gained consciousness and looked down at my phone only to\
  \ realize that it was in fact gone. From that call alone, I made my first local\
  \ friends: Byron and Carmela. Once a week, Byron provided conversational Italian\
  \ lessons, Carmela brought me out with her friends, invited me to small dinner parties,\
  \ and most excitedly, they introduced me to my first seafood pizza dome at very\
  \ small hidden gem that I would have otherwise never noticed. Their warmth and generosity\
  \ over the course of my stay was unmeasurable. \n\nAcross from my apartment was\
  \ a small dance studio. Not sure why, but this obscure and magnetic feeling drew\
  \ me in one evening. Her name was Beatrice, and she taught me how to dance salsa.\
  \ We became so close that generously classes were free of charge and unexpectedly,\
  \ I was invited to her family's home for Christmas dinner. The father was from Puglia\
  \ and he was as jolly and outgoing as one who had just won the lottery. He cooked\
  \ up several pasta, fish, and seafood dishes. My eyes rolled toward the back of\
  \ my head as the food was so incredible. Before dinner, I gave a small speech to\
  \ the best of my ability thanking them all. In these moments, I truly felt what\
  \ it was like to be an Italian."
