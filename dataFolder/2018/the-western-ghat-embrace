Text: "A man is ferried to a state of reflection as one passes the Western Ghats.\
  \ A journey through the steeply turning roads within the south western districts\
  \ of Karnataka-India is loved by explorers; thanks to the glorious ambiance created\
  \ by nature that chooses to be in its best form here. The Western Ghats are a traveller\u2019\
  s paradise as it puts forth vast possibilities for exploration.\n\nAcknowledging\
  \ the very possibilities, we set out on a trek to what is famed to be the fanciest,\
  \ yet the hardest trekking spot of Karnataka. A day within the Charmadi Ghat gave\
  \ us a glimpse of what it means to be really close to nature.\n\nThe path where\
  \ we began is a narrow stony path with massive tree roots that sometimes provide\
  \ a grip to climb, & sometimes are bigger hurdles than we might like. This pavement\
  \ led us to the first peak - the Kodaikal, situated 3200 feet above the sea level.\
  \ A view unfolds along the way uphill\u2013 the rainforest, Nethravati river, other\
  \ peaks namely Balegudda, Amedikallu, Punyakoti,  Minchukallu & more. The aura of\
  \ the place is intensified by the rainforests that expand throughout the Ghats.\
  \ These forests have a distinct assortment of flora, feed tributaries, prevent erosion,\
  \ house a vast elephant and tiger corridor, host water catchment area & protect\
  \ an unmatched spectrum of biodiversity.\n\nWalking out of the rainforest at the\
  \ bottom of Balegudda, we put on an ambitious face to conquer the 4,000 feet high\
  \ peak. Well, only to shortly turn into red sighing faces. This peak is hard to\
  \ climb as the hill is only grass & a seemingly endless uphill that provides no\
  \ balance underneath the feet whatsoever, nor any shade overhead. Well, it is all\
  \ worth it once at the peak \u2013 for it feels like the top of the world.\n\nA\
  \ 10 kilometres walk within the forest led us to the tribal residents within. The\
  \ Gowdas tribe is a small village within the Western Ghats with only 5 families\
  \ now. Life is hard for them, yet serene. Their welcome faces and warm hospitality\
  \ persuaded us to hand over whatever financial aid we could, for they lack a consistent\
  \ source of income.\n\nThat D-day, every drop of water counted, every hill represented\
  \ a legacy, every tree yelled out to be conserved, & every blade of grass spoke\
  \ of the essence of nature. A trek within the Western Ghats changes perspectives\
  \ & connects us deeper to nature, alongside giving us lasting memories. Every explorer\
  \ needs a trek within the Charmadi Ghat, to give his sense of exploration a touch\
  \ of accomplishment."
