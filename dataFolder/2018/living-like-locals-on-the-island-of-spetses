Text: "Boats arrived and departed from the landing on Spetses with exact precision.\
  \ It was an island the Athenians loved but few tourists had explored. Our hostess,\
  \ Sophie, met us on the waterfront promenade dotted with caf\xE9'. Patrons sipped\
  \ their coffee and observed us on the dock. She introduced herself and she flagged\
  \ a taxi for us.  \n\nA white-walled compound surrounded the house that faced the\
  \ Saronic Gulf. It was at the top of the hillside. The courtyard was filled with\
  \ lemon trees and pots brimming with bright fuchsia flowers. A tiny, but deep pool\
  \ was situated right off the stone patio. My girls, hot and tired from travel, ran\
  \ upstairs to change into swimsuits. Sophie gave us a tour of our rooms and when\
  \ we stepped out back, we discovered the view. The gulf was dreamlike in its perfection\
  \ from the top of the hill. Sophie mentioned the custom of \"siesta.\" The locals\
  \ shuttered their shops to nap from 2:00 pm to 6:00 pm. She gently suggested that\
  \ we respect the neighbors and be as quiet as possible at that time and she left\
  \ us to settle in.\n\nThat day we sat by our pool. The water was frigid, and the\
  \ girls shrieked which led to a fit of giggles. I observed one of the neighbors\
  \ peering out her window and closing her shutters. I reminded the girls to keep\
  \ their voices down. \n\nEarly that evening, we decided to go out for dinner and\
  \ walked down the hill. We noticed a simple restaurant and although it was not dinner\
  \ hour, went in. We managed to explain our order through hand gestures, which distressed\
  \ our waitress. I secretly started to wonder what ten days would feel like there,\
  \ especially with the language barrier. The food was rustic and delicious, but my\
  \ girls were picky eaters and dined on bread and butter.\n\nAs the days unfolded,\
  \ we walked down to town. As we trudged up the incline, we gained a respite by stopping\
  \ in the local grocery and pointed to the produce we wanted. After a few days, we\
  \ exchanged smiles and simple greetings with the proprietors and I asked about the\
  \ Greek names of the items. From then on, I was able to ask for the items properly,\
  \ exchanging genuine smiles with the local people. We adopted the culture and strolled\
  \ downtown for dinner at 9:00 pm. We allowed the girls to eat ice cream after dinner\
  \ and stayed up late from all the sugar.\n\nThe islanders wished us good morning\
  \ or good evening on our walks. We absorbed the notion that our new connections\
  \ made us feel like locals."
