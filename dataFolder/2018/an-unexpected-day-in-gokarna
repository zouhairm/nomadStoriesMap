Text: "Have you ever saw a dream with open eyes? Have you felt the least expected\
  \ things?  Have you ever gone through the experience of being loved by the strangest\
  \ people? If not, then this story is for you.\nWe were a group of four. We came\
  \ very happy from our homes. I have heard a lot about the beauty and serenity of\
  \ pristine beaches of Gokarna, which is completely true. Gokarna is one of the most\
  \ amazing places I have ever visited.\nWhen you see people there, you will not believe\
  \ on the simplicity and politeness they have! We were staying in a home converted\
  \ to hotel sort of room. It was cheap and the owner was a lady in her mid-40s.\n\
  The clear water, pristine beaches, beautiful roads and scenic beauty made us fall\
  \ in love with that place immediately.\nWe visited the  beaches, temples and everything\
  \ was epitome of perfection in its own sense. All of us were feeling the sense of\
  \ relaxation in beach water. Suddenly one of my friend who had all the money and\
  \ cards, lost his tiny bag in sea water. Everyone was startled. It was crazy! \n\
  We searched for it but it was lost somewhere in the water. \nWe all were worried.\
  \ All that joy which was few minute back we had, was gone. We had to pay for the\
  \ hotel room also. That pristine beauty was no longer alluring. That peaceful sunlight\
  \ was no longer pacifying.\nWe went back to the hotel room, told the lady entire\
  \ story. We looked hopeless, actually we were.\nShe heard the entire story. We were\
  \ hungry with no money. She told us not to worry and offered us food.\n After having\
  \ food, she said, \u201Cmoney is temporary, relations are permanent. You are like\
  \ my children. Don\u2019t bother about money!\u201D\nnot only this, she gave us\
  \ some money also.\nAfter losing that tiny bag, my first worry was how I would handle\
  \ this hotel problem. But here was the solution!\nBut this incident has changed\
  \ my perspective about life. No matter where you are, no matter how bad the world\
  \ is, you will always find good around you!\nFor me travelling is not an activity\
  \ which should be planned, I believe in spontaneity. When you let go your fears\
  \ and accept the world the way it is, you will find the most amazing experiences!\n\
  That lady was almost god for us and did the least expected thing for us.\nI remember\
  \ Gokarna not only for its clear water, pristine beaches, beautiful roads and scenic\
  \ beauty but also for the greatness and magnanimity of its people!\n\np.s. i did\
  \ take account number of that lady's son and transferred the money once we reach\
  \ our homes."
