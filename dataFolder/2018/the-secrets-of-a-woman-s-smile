Text: "I spent one week in Myanmar before I decided to escape from the crowded and\
  \ busy places by doing an organized two-day trekking tour from Kalaw to Inle Lake.\
  \ It was also my first opportunity to explore the way of life of native tribes and\
  \ the unaffected and untouched nature of Myanmar. \nPacked with my camera and the\
  \ main items for the next two days, the journey started in the early morning. Our\
  \ tour guide Jewel, a Shan lady in the mid-twenties, got immediately my attention\
  \ through to her positive personality. Her whole face which was painted with a typical\
  \ natural powder made of Thanaka trees, radiated pure vitality and motivation. Without\
  \ to know her, she captured my imagination so that I decided to take a closer look\
  \ at her. While we walked through the fascinating and changing landscape of the\
  \ Shan State we talked about her daily life as tour guide, farmerette, mother and\
  \ wife; their community life within a tribe and cultural conventions. As part of\
  \ a Shan community she learned the relevant skills and abilities to survive within\
  \ the nature during her early childhood. Therefore, it was a simple thing for her\
  \ to explain our group of western people which plant or bush is useful to eat, to\
  \ drink or to dye. We spent the next 15km with talking, joking, photographing and\
  \ enjoying the changing nature before we arrived in a small tribe village, around\
  \ 20 km far away from Inle Lake. It was the place where we stayed for the night\
  \ in a big wooden house. The host served us a feast with all different kind of typical\
  \ Shan food such as soup, several curries and vegetables. To know, that a normal\
  \ dish of a Shan family consists of rice and \u2013 if possible - one curry made\
  \ the moment even more special for us, as hospitality means everything for Shan\
  \ people. \nEven after a long day of trekking, Jewel was still in ebullient spirits.\
  \ Interested in our lives, she started to ask some questions about our own families,\
  \ kids and husbands. While we shared some photos of our families and talked about\
  \ her young daughter, she told us in a clause that she gave birth to another baby\
  \ two years ago that died because of a cardiac anomaly. All of us were deeply shocked\
  \ about that news and felt sorry for her and her family. No one expected that behind\
  \ such a strength looking woman, who gleams with pleasure and seems to enjoy every\
  \ minute of her life, is such a sad story. She smiled to us and said: \u201CWe are\
  \ sad that she is gone, but we were allowed to get to know her for two years in\
  \ our lives\u201D."
