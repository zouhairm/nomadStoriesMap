Text: "In Tacna, Peru, I'm told to cross the street after I get off the bus. \n\n\
  At the sight of my backpack and gringa glasses, all of the collectivo drivers shout,\
  \ \"ARICA! ARICA!\" \n\n\"Arica?\" I say to a driver who nods, his offer is 20 soles,\
  \ and a deal is made. My backpack is thrown into the trunk and I'm thrown into the\
  \ backseat next to a woman holding her purse tightly who checks me out of her periphery.\n\
  \nOnce the driver sells the other four seats, we're off. Coast to my left. Andes\
  \ to my right. As the others rest, I'm awake staring out at the coast. I shrug off\
  \ the instinct that something is off; that a left side coast means a drive north.\
  \ \n\nAn hour and a half later, the driver pulls into a town and parks. Not a border\
  \ leading into Chile.\n\n\"Ilo!\" The driver says. The sleepers stir, pay, and collect\
  \ their bags. \"Se\xF1ora\u2026\" the driver sings with a smile handing me my bag.\
  \ \n\nI sigh and say, \"Arica.\" \n\n\"Ilo.\" He says.\n\n\"Yo se. But\u2026me.\
  \ Arica.\" He sighs. We communicate by miming and sighing. After a series failed\
  \ sentences in Spanglish, he is exasperated by me. \n\n\"Ay, dios mio. Se\xF1ora.\"\
  \n\nI tell him, I'm headed to Chile for work and that I must go today. \"Me, Tacna.\
  \ Para trabajo. Hoy.\" He suggests I stay in Ilo. \"Muy hermosa. Ilo. Se\xF1ora.\"\
  \  When he grasps that his Ilo sell's not working, he sighs, laughs, and rubs his\
  \ forehead. \nJose Luis' days normally go like this: \n\nHe sells the seats in Tacna,\
  \ drives to Ilo, sells the seats in Ilo, drives back to Tacna. Repeat. \n\nBut today,\
  \ he gets me. \n\nIt's his lunch break. We end up at a restaurant full of afternoon\
  \ folk, friends throwing back beers, small families smiling like the Sunday sun,\
  \ and us. Jose Luis and me. The bartender squints her eyes in our direction trying\
  \ to figure out the same thing Jose Luis and I are separately trying to figure out.\n\
  Jose shakes his head from time to time. He asks if I have a Spanish dictionary and\
  \ I give him my Lonely Planet bitterly adding, \"It's not helpful.\" He flips to\
  \ the back and finds what he's seeking.\n\nHe points on the page and then at me.\
  \ \"This phrase, you.\"\n\nYo soy perdida. \n\nOver lomo saltados we share broken\
  \ sentences about ourselves. I'm single, headed to Santiago for work. He is divorced\
  \ with two children. He questions why I don't work back in my homeland, the land\
  \ of opportunity. \"You are craze.\" He says. I tell him I have friends in Lima\
  \ and in Santiago, but I jest that I've no friends in Ilo. Something we both already\
  \ know.\n\n\"Jose Luis.\" He says. \n\n\"Uno.\""
