Text: "Running. \nHot asphalt singeing the soles of my feet, tip toe over small rocks\
  \ with balancing arms stretched wide. My raw skin, finally kissed by white sand\
  \ as i find refuge in the shade of a palm tree. \n\n\"It's a postcard\",  i say\
  \ in amazement as i find my breath. \n\"This whole place is a paradice,right!\"\n\
  My partner speaks with a sense of nostalgia. He had lived here with his father in\
  \ a different life. \n\"Port Douglas, the place where the beautiful people live!\"\
  \ \nHis statement confuses me a little but i pay no time to the thought. \n\nWe\
  \ walk hand in hand up Four Mile beach; sun on our faces, sand in our toes and the\
  \ most beautiful blue ocean backdrop i had ever laid eyes on. \n\n\"Why is no-one\
  \ here?\" I asked, taken away by the fact that i was staring at Gods garden on a\
  \ sunny Sunday during the summer holidays and i could count the number of people\
  \ on a long stretch of beach on one hand. \n\"Where is everyone?\"\n\"Probably tucked\
  \ away in their fancy resorts.\" he answered looking up at coconuts in the trees.\n\
  \ \nMy mind casts back to the drive in; beautiful coastal road with the pristine\
  \ beach to the right and on the left the most dense, mesmerising, green rainforest-that\
  \ is till we reach a roundabout, head towards town where the landscape drastically\
  \ changes to high white walls, manicured lawns and prestigious lettering written\
  \ on proud signage. \n\n\"Right..\" \n\n\"Look!\" he said with child like wonder\
  \ in his eyes. \nHe runs over to what looks to me, a wet piece of wood. As he shakes\
  \ it to his ear, i realise I'm looking at a coconut. \n\"I used to come to the beach\
  \ all the time and just eat coconuts all day and talk to people on the beach.\"\
  \ \nI raise an eyebrow to his statement, given our isolation. \n\"Here, come here.\"\
  \ He gestures for me to take the coconut and walks towards a small nearly dead tree.\
  \ \n\n\"Right here, this is good.\" He takes the coconut from me, scopes it out\
  \ then suddenly, 'THROWPH!'\nWith some force, he brings the coconut down onto a\
  \ protruding stump off the tree. \n\"Here you try\" he hands me the injured nut.\
  \ \n\"You've got to sort of pry it down, like you're peeling it.\" \n\nWe laugh\
  \ as my determined self works to remove the husk. \n\"Finally!\" I exaggerate as\
  \ i pretend to wipe the sweat from my brow.\nHe laughs and takes the coconut from\
  \ my hands. \n\"Watch out.\" As he ushers me to step back. \n'Crack!' \nHe throws\
  \ the brown ball against a nearby palm but instead of bouncing back it cracks in\
  \ two. \nWe sit, we smile, look out to the sun on the horizon- fresh coconut in\
  \ hand."
