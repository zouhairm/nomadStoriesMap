Text: "Really? Do we really need to get up at 3 in the morning? Nooooo!\". I admit\
  \ that this was my first tough. It was like 3\xBAC outside and my backpack was full\
  \ of summer clothes since I was travelling through Southeast Asia and it was very\
  \ hot everywhere.\n\nIt was late July and after been backpacking for 5 months, me\
  \ and Diogo decided that we wouldn\u2019t be leaving Indonesia without trekking\
  \ to see Bromo first. We had only one more day ahead before departing and we rush\
  \ to get the most cheapest hotel and eat some hot drinks. \n\nWe took 2 buses and\
  \ one van to get to Bromo. We decided to go for it so after several hours we were\
  \ at the beginning of the trekking trail which would lead us to our destination,\
  \ and took some moments to reflect on what we were about to do.\n\nIt had been a\
  \ rough year for me: I quit a full-time job so I could study so I had two part-time\
  \ jobs, another job that I only did for once or twice a month, I was studying at\
  \ night and I lost my father in November. As for my boyfriend, he was struggling\
  \ between giving up his job and travel or just keep working in a job he hated. They\
  \ say everything happens for a reason. Together for almost 4 years, we decided to\
  \ backpacking for 6 months and here we were in Bromo, Indonesia!\n\nMaybe this difficult\
  \ trekking was meant to remember that life is tough, but there are still things\
  \ worth fighting for. Besides your toughts about the great view you'd see, nothing\
  \ can compare to what we really saw around 5am to 7.30am. The smell of fresh leaves,\
  \ the grey turning blue and then white coulds, the fresh air, the horses smell,\
  \ the sound of people tired but glad to do that trekking it's unbeliavable.\n\n\
  Along our way, we met couples, friends and almost all nationalities were together\
  \ in that special place. When we reached the top, the view was superb. For a few\
  \ moments we just shut our mouths and apreciate the beauty. And when I laid on our\
  \ bed that night, I realized that I could overcome wathever and do something better\
  \ out of my life. Just because. \n\nMy last tough was: We are all beautiful and\
  \ strong as Bromo vulcano!"
