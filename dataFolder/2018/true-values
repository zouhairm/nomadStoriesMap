Text: "Hundreds of kilometers of highways and country roads. Recently laid and witnessed\
  \ the change of epochs and generations. The road is a symbol of endless movement\
  \ and new discoveries. From the big city we went to the tiny villages of the Altai\
  \ Territory in search of representatives of indigenous small peoples. The more we\
  \ moved away from cities, driving through majestic mountains of Altai, the more\
  \ often I thought about, how people lived here hundreds of years ago. Even in a\
  \ modern comfortable bus, a trip at -36 \u2103 becomes a real test, and centuries\
  \ ago only sledges and horses were the only transport, instead of a car heater was\
  \ a sheepskin coat. On the third day of the trip we reached the pearl of the Altai\
  \ Territory - Teletskoye Lake. The locals call it Altyn Kol - Golden Lake. The elder\
  \ of the village told us a legend, the words of which the Altaians put on the song.\
  \ It says, that one day there was a crop failure, and hunger came to these places.\
  \ One of the villagers had a large piece of gold, and he decided to exchange it\
  \ for food for his family. He walked a long time, visited a lot of yurts, but nobody\
  \ had products, no one needed a gold. It is beautiful, brilliant, the eye pleases,\
  \ but it\u2018s cold and hard, you can\u2019t throw it into the cauldron, you  can\u2019\
  t feed the children. Then he climbed the mountain and said: \"Gold, which doesn\u2019\
  t cost a single handful of barley, let it lies at the bottom\", - and hurled it\
  \ far into the lake, which since that time is called Altyn-K\xF6l - Golden. We looked\
  \ at the lake for a long time, but it did not sparkle with gold - only ice frozed\
  \ on its surface. We left the Altai Territory quite different people. We found in\
  \ this journey something, that we did not expect. We studied life, we looked for\
  \ the half-forgotten folklore of local residents, hoping to preserve this unique\
  \ culture. But, as it turned out, we learned a lot from them. Strong Siberian frosts\
  \ and a short summer made the highest values \u200B\u200Bof this people a successful\
  \ hunt, a good harvest, a family and hospitality. Nobody was denied shelter here,\
  \ food was appreciated much more gold, and hunting gear was the main wealth. Here,\
  \ far from the big roads, where there is not everywhere a cellular connection, trying\
  \ national food, listening to ancient songs and legends, as if you have been transferred\
  \ to many centuries in the past, remembering the true human values. And we, living\
  \ in the 21st century, have returned to our roots, which firmly bind us to the land\
  \ of our  ancestors."
