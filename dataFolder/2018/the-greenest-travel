Text: "Hi! My name is Luna! Last year I had an opportunity that could not be rejected.\
  \ I received a scholarship from a private school in Amsterdam, so i managed to spend\
  \ 6 months around the Netherlands. I left Italy on May: it was a sunny day and although\
  \ it was 5 AM I was really excited to start this big experience. I went alone and\
  \ by bus, thus I had no friends to talk with but it didn't matter because I felt\
  \ like super excited. I went by bus so the travel was long, but I personally think\
  \ that the ride itself is one of the best stuff of traveling. I met new people all\
  \ around Europe and it's really interesting because not only you can experience\
  \ your languages skills, but you can also \"touch\" and feel new cultures and uses\
  \ of the people I was knowing. The travel took two days and a half and when I arrived,\
  \ on 4th May it was a rainy day in Amsterdam. Some people were looking for me because\
  \ they know I'd arrived. There was a kind girl named Sarah, who took me on a boat\
  \ through the Amsterdam's little canals to bring me to the school I would attend\
  \ for two weeks. The capital is awesome, the strange palaces, with all these allined\
  \ windows and all these little doors. It seemed like being in a cartoon movie, people\
  \ are kind and one of the first thing I noticed is that they don't use curtains\
  \ on the windows, so you can see what people do in their own spaces, there's no\
  \ intimity and it's interesting because it feels like you're immediately part of\
  \ a big new family, that has no secrets to keep. In few weeks I was able to speak\
  \ their language, because I had some teachers who were really patient to me.   \n\
  After two school weeks, I chose to go for a trip of a month around the Netherlands,\
  \ so that I could visit other cities like Rotterdam, that's littler than Amsterdam,\
  \ but still keeps its beautifulness through the small houses.\nHowever the best\
  \ thing I experienced through my travel was seeing how people live there, and how\
  \ much different is their culture respectfully to mine and so to Italian one too.\
  \ They kind of live in another world, because most of their economy's based on tourism\
  \ and farming. There are lots of sheeps andand animals in the countryside around\
  \ Amsterdam and a lot of green nature and trees, so I loved it. I loved it because\
  \ it was the last thing I expected! I imagined a world made of big palaces and smog\
  \ and stuff of this tipe, but in reality it's an unpolluted place, so if you want\
  \ some relax and healthy air, just take your suitcases and go to Netherlands!"
