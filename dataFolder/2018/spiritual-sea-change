Text: "I made a promise to myself long ago to see this planet in all of its splendor.\
  \ Travel was a way to explore cultures foreign to my world view. It inspired me\
  \ seek corners of the globe that would enrich my spirit, to leave behind my individualistic\
  \ country and immerse myself into collectivist civilizations. This singular promise\
  \ has pushed me to the edge. This decision has made all the difference in my emotional\
  \ evolution. It became my mission to experience international customs firsthand\
  \ and force myself out of the isolation of my introversion. My road to self-actualization\
  \ started with the reexamination of the fallacy that travel should be confined to\
  \ the United States. This socially prescribed cocoon anchored me to charted waters\
  \ and left me empty as I searched for a sense of culture that could not be found\
  \ within these walls. College was the first sea change of my spirit. I studied psychology\
  \ and began my life-long curiosity for the intricacies of human nature. This intellectual\
  \ need to know humanity in all of its complexity, shaped me as a writer and storyteller\
  \ as I wanted authenticity for my characters. \n \nThe first life altering trip\
  \ beyond the boundaries of my perceived limitations was to Southeast Asia. I backpacked\
  \ across the countryside's of Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. In that short\
  \ time, the veil was lifted from my eyes as l immersed in the cultures I longed\
  \ for and bathed in their luxury. For me, it was the smallest seedling that took\
  \ root and grew into something grandiose. There in the outskirts of Phuket, on the\
  \ side of the road was a shine that stood chest high. It was adorned by a tiny Buddha\
  \ figurine as incense burned in veneration. Alongside it was six other shrines that\
  \ had since toppled, but for reasons I couldn\u2019t comprehend, were never moved\
  \ or discarded. It was a mystery that would haunt me for the rest of my time there.\
  \ In my final hours before returning home, it suddenly made sense. It was the belief\
  \ that everything that came before had significance, despite its age or functionality,\
  \ at one point it held meaning for someone and so it should remain. This collectivist\
  \ view was so profound and touching that it moved me in vastly spiritual ways I\
  \ could not define for years to come. It became the essence of why I travel, the\
  \ distillate of words and sentiment I share with you now. Those souls that I have\
  \ met along the way have reinvigorated my vitality and filled my heart with longing\
  \ for a world larger than my imagination."
