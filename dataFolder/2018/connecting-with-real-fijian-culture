Text: "I was planning my 2017 trip and i was looking in the map, which country i could\
  \ visit on my own, that allows me connect with locals. I have read in many blogs,\
  \ guides, magazines that Fijian people are just incredible, very kind and smiling,\
  \ but if you are guided by tour operators, probably you will not see real Fijian\
  \ culture, because in the big resort what you find is a wonderful hotel which owner\
  \ is not fijian. In this hotels fijian people work for few money, although tourist\
  \ pays a lot of money to the owner, and is just that what i was avoiding. \nSo i\
  \ went to Taveuni Island, known also as the green island, and what i found there\
  \ was what i told you, but then i explore a little bit the island on my own. Locals\
  \ were always helpful telling me indications, asking if i need help, i shared a\
  \ couple of hours with them and told me about their routine, and always offer me\
  \ a drink.\nAfter 4 days i move to Vanua Levu, and i live there for 5 days, in a\
  \ local community. They were so surprised i was traveling on my own, surprised because\
  \ i was not married and had no kids, and when i was interested in learning who they\
  \ make handicrafts their eyes were so open....At night they told me to have some\
  \ kava drink with them, and in small communities they do not prepare have drink\
  \ in beautiful recipients like in the hotels, here they use plastic containers to\
  \ prepare the same drink...\nFor me was really easy share those days with them,\
  \ always with an smile in their face.\nMy trip end in another remote place in Viti\
  \ Levu, the main island, many locals did not know that area. Here i spend 5 days\
  \ with a local family in a local community again, and here all the family accept\
  \ me easily. Kids just want to play with another person, know new jokes and have\
  \ fun.\nNowadays more people are travel to different countries to feel different\
  \ cultures and i am happy for that, i do not like what globalization in making.\
  \ I think each country has to keep it\xB4s identity."
