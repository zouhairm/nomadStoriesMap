Text: "Gazing out the passenger window of the yute, I tried to comprehend the sheer\
  \ vastness of Australia. This vastness was further compounded by remoteness. Hailing\
  \ from a rural Ireland I was no stranger to living remotely. Perhaps this is why\
  \ I now found myself working as a farm hand in Skipton. Founded on the Goldrush,\
  \ the town of Skipton is located in the Western District of Victoria. A mere stone\
  \ throws away from the regional centre of Ballarat yet a world apart from the sprawling\
  \ urban land mass that is the foodie nirvana of Melbourne.\n\nThe yute lurched forward\
  \ and jolted me back to reality. A thick plume of red dust rose behind us and as\
  \ we sped towards the farm. Ricks gruff voice permeated my thoughts. I glanced over\
  \ at him. Dressed head to toe in faded fluro.He expertly navigated hairpin turns\
  \ at breakneck speed. These routes now deeply etched in his mind after twenty years.\
  \ Rick was my employer, an established grain farmer, in addition to a mental health\
  \ advocate within the farming community. This last bit of information stuck in my\
  \ mind like a sickle. As my time on the farm slowly turned into months it became\
  \ painfully aware how this lifestyle can push you over the edge.\n\nInitially, the\
  \ farmwork was a novelty.  I relished the feeling of the warm sun on my face, watched\
  \ white butterflies skitter playfully across the cloudless blue sky, and enjoyed\
  \ the low-stress tasks.\n\nHowever, I quickly became aware of how susceptible a\
  \ farmer is to the wrath of mother nature. A dry sun-scorched landscape can quickly\
  \ turn into a mud bath. Leaving in its wake bogged vehicles, ruined crops and fragile\
  \ minds.\n\nAl a young farmer who recently returned from Canada to take over the\
  \ family farm near Skipton articulated it quite succinctly 'You are at the mercy\
  \ of the elements'. While Bill an older farmer from the Renmark area added a note\
  \ of dark humour ''My Dad used to joke it\u2019s the worst form of child abuse you\
  \ can get is hand the family farm to your son''. However farming is not the only\
  \ common denominator these two men share. They are both suicide survivors and speak\
  \ candidly about their experiences on a documentary called 'You Can't Ask That'.\
  \ \n\nWhile the farming experience seems appealing it is a constant battle. A daily\
  \ battle with mother nature in addition to your own inner turmoil.\n\nMaking a local\
  \ connection creates not only a friendship, but a offers a deeper understanding\
  \ of the community, the people and the issues that lie beneath the surface."
