Text: "Opening the door I headed out of the Poet\u2019s house and over to the centre\
  \ of Santiago.\nHands in pockets, head down, shoulders hunched. I formed an imaginary\
  \ barrier against the cold - as I was in shirt sleeves facing a breeze with a slightly\
  \ icy edge.\nThey call Pablo Neruda the \u2018Shakespeare of Chile\u2019.  Hard\
  \ to imagine a man like that being considered an enemy of the state as he once was\
  \ under the Pinochet dictatorship.  \nIt was an Italian film ('Il Postino') that\
  \ had connected me with his Spanish verse - lines from which were now swirling around\
  \ my head as with a brisk step, I made my way to meet her.\nEngland had been enjoying\
  \ an Indian summer just before I had departed on a long-haul flight for this my\
  \ tryst with destiny.\nThere was a paucity of poetry in my life back then, when\
  \ I packed tomatoes in boxes on a factory production line.  \nNumbers and targets\
  \ had squashed out verse and rhyme - until she came into my life, and became the\
  \ most exotic fruit I had ever tasted.\nHer return to Chile had left my heart in\
  \ solitary confinement.  But now, finally, the months of waiting would soon be over.\n\
  I arrived early and took a seat at the corner cafe.\nSipping a hot chocolate, impatiently\
  \ scanning the crowd - a continually moving visual feast of office workers, vendors,\
  \ shoppers, and recyclers.\nAll of them seemingly being urged homewards by the screeching-shrieking\
  \ of starlings taking to the trees, as if warning that the hour of curfew was imminent.\n\
  Taking a brief rest from rapid eye movement I focused on the building opposite,\
  \ which had now come into view through the slowly-thinning throng. \nHoney-coloured\
  \ stone, with large carved wooden doors. It would have looked sublime had it not\
  \ been defaced by a faceless person writing a single line of graffiti beneath the\
  \ entrance doors just beyond my range of vision. \nMy phone suddenly buzzed and\
  \ shuddered in my pocket, like a painless electric shock.  A message: \u20185 mins\u2019\
  .  \nHeart palpitations were starting to make themselves felt - after all it had\
  \ been so long.\nAn attempt to relax, but that would only come later after I'd felt\
  \ the jolt of energy at the meeting of our eyes\u2026and lips.\nThen - there she\
  \ was.  I rose to greet her, walking over to meet her.  A long and warm embrace...suddenly\
  \ transformed. \nMelting heart became melting smile. A cold chill ran down my spine,\
  \ as I could now read the line which slammed the door on a poetic day, with a simple,\
  \ stark, statement:\n\u2018AQUI TORTURARON A MI HIJO\u2019  (\u2018MY SON WAS TORTURED\
  \ HERE')"
