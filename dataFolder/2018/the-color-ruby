Text: "Everyone I meet has a color. His color is a ruby. Sometimes it takes a few\
  \ moments to see it, but once I do, it\u2019s the most obvious answer. Ruby is strong,\
  \ passionate, intense, loving, sorrowful, complex. I see Spain in the color ruby;\
  \ I also see blood and madness and beauty, as well as my birthstone. Funny to think\
  \ I wore him around my neck all these years, in the small stone my mother gave me\
  \ linked to a thin gold chain.\nWe connected while Catalu\xF1a was stirring a revolution,\
  \ and somehow that makes it seem more important, more urgent, our connection. He\u2019\
  d tell me about it everyday: angry, fueled, tired, frustrated. The rest of the world\
  \ just kind of watched passively, apathetically, a small revolt in a first-world\
  \ country that seemed futile and outweighed on a global scale, but still we watched,\
  \ because everyone has a memory, a story, an internal pull toward Catalu\xF1a, that\
  \ rust, caramel, tangerine, earth-colored region. \nThe time we spent together in\
  \ Barcelona... It never fails. Whenever people hear the name, they sigh. Everyone\
  \ has a story, a memory, a love affair with the city. It\u2019s a jewel. It\u2019\
  s the image of tanned skin and sparkling sea; the food is more succulent, the air\
  \ is more sweet, the music is more romantic; the people are more bohemian. \nIt\
  \ was a rich week. We stalked the narrow, gothic streets, walking past singing gypsies\
  \ from a different era completely, ran our hands along the cold medieval stones\
  \ that make up the city, kissed in the shadows of la Catedral de Barcelona, sipped\
  \ on light cava and shared bottles of Spanish wine, feasted with loud, long tables\
  \ of Catalan friends, and drove through the red, rust hills of the Catalan country\
  \ side. \nBy this point it was undeniable. His blood, his region, his love, his\
  \ city, it was all painted ruby, and it became more and more prominent and intensified\
  \ in my sight each passing day. \nI don't know what my color is; I may never fully\
  \ know, but honestly I haven\u2019t really tried. I believe your color is only revealed\
  \ through the eyes of others, but I can strive to emulate the colors I admire: the\
  \ humanity in earth tones, the calmness of oceanic tones, the intelligence in deep\
  \ gem tones, the whimsy of pastel tones, the creativity in loud tones, Spanish tones,\
  \ Barcelona tones, ruby tones\u2026 \nCaught between wherever I am and Barcelona,\
  \ caught between colors, and finally, living in the center of it all, seeing it\
  \ all, these great palette contrasts, maybe, just maybe, creating a new color all\
  \ together."
