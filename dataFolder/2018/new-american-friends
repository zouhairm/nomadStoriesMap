Text: "I came to the JFK Airport at 17 pm and had next flight at Westchester Airport\
  \ at 7 am next day. The road takes 40 minutes by car what I didn't know, accordingly\
  \ wasn't ready for. As I was never abroad and almost hadn't spoken with native-speakers\
  \ it was critically hard to explain the receptionist my situation. May be you know\
  \ or not, but in JFK wi-fi works only if you have US number. So, unsuccessfully\
  \ I was trying to find metro and bus. It was almost 9 pm and becoming dark outside.\
  \ Moreover 'Taximen' striving to make money on foreigners, lack of  food and the\
  \ idea that I am abroad and alone increased fear in me. \n Here I met my first American\
  \ friend. She was also student and very attractive. She called for an Uber for me\
  \ and even persuaded a driver to make a discount. Till today I feel goofy that I\
  \ do not remember her name and did not take her contacts.\n The second friend was\
  \ that Uber driver. Despite of the fact that he took $80 (for the same distance\
  \ in Kazakhstan we pay $7) he was good man and pleasant companion. Ali was Pakistani\
  \ and Muslim. Then it turned out this picture: two Asian guys in a Japanese car\
  \ in New York, one is driver the second is client. It was a Ramadan month and he\
  \ bought a coffee to finish his all day fasting. All way Ali explained how he won\
  \ a green card, how he started working there and what he has achieved for the last\
  \ 2 years in US. Listening his stories I was amazed with a high level of living\
  \ in the US and with tolerance of Americans to other religions. Then I understood\
  \ why people dreaming about American life.\n The best friend I met in my second\
  \ job place, where I was a housekeeper. He was studying in college for IT and served\
  \ in the military forces of the United States as marine for 5 years. I still remember\
  \ as if it was only yesterday how I urged him to go to the Walmart after working\
  \ days; every other day going to the gym; day spent in a water park and how later\
  \ we had a smarsh-mellows; how we played soccer; how I always got with questions\
  \ about buying a phone in Amazon. During these three months he gave me a trip to\
  \ several cities and gave an opportunity to get acquainted with American cultural\
  \ and natural resources. I'm proud to have a friend with whom I can talk for hours\
  \ on a snapchat despite of we are separated by thousands of miles."
