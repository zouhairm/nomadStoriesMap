Text: "Stepping off the train, I breathed in the salty air and got literally knocked\
  \ off my feet by the wind. \u201CYou have arrived in Brest\u201D the voice announced\
  \ in French. Here I was, ready to start a new chapter of my life in Finist\xE8re\
  \ or \"End of the World\".\n\u201CI wonder what brought you here,\" the taxi driver\
  \ asked me. It's too far away to be random.\n\u201CIt might be a destiny\" I replied.\
  \ \"I just wanted a change and took a one-way ticket\".\n\u201CFair enough. Just\
  \ be prepared, you will cry here twice\u2013once on your arrival and once you leave\
  \ Finist\xE8re.\n\u201CHere we are, enjoy your stay,\u201D the driver said.\nIt\
  \ didn\u2019t take me long to understand the meaning of his words. I had to put\
  \ up with the grey Breton sky. I was soaking wet as my umbrella ended up in the\
  \ nearest bin, ripped by a violent gust of wind. My hairstyle turned into a heap\
  \ of messy tight knots. I could not really complain about the weather, as according\
  \ to a Breton saying \u201CIn Brittany, it rains only on nasty people\u201D. \n\
  While its unofficial ending says \"because all the good folks are in the pub\u201D\
  . Here\u2019s the remedy against an approaching depression. \nAt the bar with a\
  \ symbolic name \u201CThe Edge of the World\u201D, the atmosphere was hot with friendliness\
  \ and damp with beer. As a result of a random conversation, I soon ended up on a\
  \ rocky island in the vicinity of Brest with a bunch of locals.This extraordinary\
  \ expedition was organised by a local guy Romain. Sheltered in a former war bunker,\
  \ we were playing a game of Palet Breton, sipping sweet Chouchen and savouring some\
  \ marvels of Breton cuisine as fresh mussels and a cake with a tongue-twisting name\
  \ of Kouign-Amann.\nA guitar appeared from nowhere in Romain's hands, filling up\
  \ the cave with the tunes of a traditional Breton song. There was something unifying\
  \ about it, as we all started to move rhythmically around the fire, shoulder to\
  \ shoulder. Suddenly I felt myself a part of this group of Bretons, a particle of\
  \ the enormous granite stones and of the roaring foamy waves outside.This fleeting\
  \ moment was like a sort of a spell under which I started to feel love towards the\
  \ rugged Brittany.\nMy heart sank when the plane was taking off. The sun was shining\
  \ brightly over the bay of Brest. I recalled all the experiences I had lived on\
  \ the Edge of the World, that transformed me into a new person.  Realizing that\
  \ it was all over, I suddenly felt sad. Tears welled up in my eyes. \u201CYou will\
  \ cry twice\u201D the words of the taxi driver pounded in my ears. It dawned on\
  \ me that he was terribly right."
