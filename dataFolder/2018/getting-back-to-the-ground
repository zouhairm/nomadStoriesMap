Text: "After 5 years of working in travel and living in downtown Toronto, I began\
  \ to see a change in my personality and my mannerisms.  Originally from Northern\
  \ Ontario I grew up outdoors, hiking through the woods, kayaking rivers, and just\
  \ generally being one with nature.  Moving to Toronto was a big move but I instantly\
  \ fell in love with the pulse and expansive culture of this city.  I began working\
  \ for a small travel company writing about backpacking through Europe and travelling\
  \ across Australia and New Zealand (which was a dream for someone straight out of\
  \ university).  Slowly I began to take on larger projects and found myself handling\
  \ corporate and luxury brand products to research and marketing.  I began to crave\
  \ 5 stars over the hostel feel, the premium seat over the back of the plane, and\
  \ a large SUV to pick me up from the airport instead of a local bus..but I mean...who\
  \ wouldn't?  So I began to change and moved into a condo, started to spend less\
  \ time exploring nature and more time indoors and in boardrooms.  Never noticing\
  \ that I was slowly starting to lose my connection to the ground I was walking on.\
  \  \nIn the summer of 2017, my work offered my an opportunity to volunteer in Tortuguero\
  \ National Park in Costa Rica, working with the research team there on Sea Turtle\
  \ Conversation.  I immediately said yes and they shipped me off DSLR in hand and\
  \ ready to capture anything and everything.  What I didn't expect was the second\
  \ my feet hit the jungle floor everything changed.   With no cell reception, no\
  \ mirrors, 45 degree humidity and an hour boat ride to the closest town, I was totally\
  \ out of my comfort zone.  From day one I faced challenge after challenge, both\
  \ physically and mentally, from dealing with scorpions in jacket pockets to bats\
  \ flying around all night to the sound of wild animals as we hiked through the deep\
  \ jungle, the Toronto city girl in me was slowly being defeated by this wild new\
  \ world.  \nThen something happened: I started to enjoy the sounds that carried\
  \ through the night.  I began to learn which came from which animal.  I no longer\
  \ needed to connect to the outside world or see what I looked like.  I instead began\
  \ to focus on the environment around me and how everything was connected and each\
  \ insect and animal had its place in the world.  \nOn the last day I stood on the\
  \ wet jungle floor looking at the trees and the world around me.  \nAnd as I dug\
  \ my feet deep into the soil, I knew that I was finally grounded again. \nWelcome\
  \ back to Earth."
