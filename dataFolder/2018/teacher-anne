Text: "Crouched precariously on the back of an averagely constructed wooden donkey\
  \ cart, we dig our fingers into gaping holes on rusted planks to stabilize ourselves.\
  \ Our bodies jerk left and right in an unsophisticated attempt to dodge the whip\
  \ like bamboo stick that slings back threatening to take out our heads. Fed up with\
  \ our distinctively more incommodious movements than its usual static 80L water\
  \ tank, the donkey plods up the bank directly into a thorn bush to arrange our removal.\
  \ Teacher Anne and I are left watching as with a final aggressive swing, the 7 year\
  \ old\u2019s frayed branch makes contact to skin, muscles stammer, legs buck and\
  \ dust fills the air. \n\nThe dull heat of the sun and a thin layer of dust simmers\
  \ to settle as weight on my skin accompanying us on our journey. With Teacher Anne\u2019\
  s slender scarred hand anchored to mine, I forget I\u2019m a passing stranger in\
  \ this observant village. Her face lights up, softens and umber eyes deepen as she\
  \ introduces each family we visit.\n\nA grandmother to her 12 children\u2019s offspring,\
  \ rounded back and worn hands exhibit a woman hardened by life\u2019s grind. Despite\
  \ the years on her appearance, she whirls with excitement as we arrive. Having never\
  \ ventured past the edges of the Rift Valley that lies just in sight over her 70\
  \ years, my ghostly white skin is the embodiment of a gift sent from her god. Appreciative\
  \ hugs and nonstop \u201CAsante Sanas\u201D echo gracious attitudes of locals. Next,\
  \ 3 children and a couple cobbled together by fortuity of both surrendering to severe\
  \ mental illness. Their inheritance of a five-acre property perfectly paints the\
  \ picture of a popular starving Africa seen on TV. Dry cracked and dusty dirt stares\
  \ up, begging to be like the succulent green crops that occupy every inch of land\
  \ owned by neighbors. \n\nHand never leaving mine, Teacher Anne recounts her past\
  \ and the all too familiar story that left her with bruises, scars, multiple missing\
  \ teeth and two children to raise on her own. Her steady, unwavering voice amplified\
  \ by the warmth of her presence calmed the uncomfortable pierce that travelled up\
  \ my neck leaving a large stone like lump in the back of my throat. \n\nRemembering\
  \ Teacher Anne\u2019s story months later, I recognize that gut wrenching pierce\
  \ that travels down my spine. The sound of the same story etched onto a looping\
  \ record that plays in our own painfully perfect homes. And I realize I didn\u2019\
  t have to travel 9000km to hear that pierce, I just had to look into the same deep\
  \ umber eyes of my sister."
