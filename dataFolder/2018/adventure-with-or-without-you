Text: "My mom handed me a truth-bomb long ago that you can't control the behavior\
  \ of others, only your own reaction to their behavior. \nBasically your general\
  \ attitude towards the negative things that are thrown at you will determine how\
  \ the rest of your story plays out. \n\nI was full of excitement for my first trip\
  \ to Europe. First stop: Amsterdam. I had never been outside of North America, and\
  \ I was excited to explore Europe for the next three weeks. I had plans to go from\
  \ Amsterdam, Croatia, Munich and Berlin by plane, train and automobile. This was\
  \ going to be the biggest adventure of my lifetime. I was happy to be doing this\
  \ with my boyfriend of 8 months, who for the last 5 months had outlined the itinerary\
  \ of this trip with me. \n\nWe landed at Schipol airport, took a short train ride\
  \ to our accomodation, and just as we were settling in he dropped a bombshell:\n\
  \ \"I dont think we should be together anymore\".  The timing of this decision of\
  \ his could not be less ideal. This trip was going to be our great adventure, this\
  \ trip I had saved up for was a gift to myself, and I did not have a plan B since\
  \ we made and booked all of our plans together. \n\nI was heartbroken, and as I\
  \ sat on the floor of a small airbnb, in a foreign country, without any of my friends\
  \ or family my eyes welled with tears and I felt very alone and sorry for myself.\
  \ Then i snapped out of it, and decided to listen to my mothers advice. I decided\
  \ that this trip was a bigger deal to me than the sadness I was feeling at that\
  \ moment. The trip and my great adventure will not be overshadowed by a failed 8\
  \ month relationship. I asked if he was still game to pursue the trip with me, or\
  \ if I should plan to go on by myself. He opted to come with me. \n\nI was hurt,\
  \ and did not understand why he chose the timing he did, but he was probably hurting\
  \ too, and in some way we both could use the company. Relationship status aside,\
  \ we travelled on together, and I experienced all the wonderful things I set out\
  \ to see. I did so with tunnel vision focus on the new things I would see and do,\
  \ and not what I was feeling about the relationship or his feelings. \n\nI drove\
  \ a standard for the first time up a cliffside on the island of mljet in Croatia,\
  \ I climbed down a steep embankment into a grotto and floated on the salty water\
  \ of the adriatic sea, I tried to sneak my way through security at Oktoberfest and\
  \ got kicked out of the tents. Men may come and go out of my life, but these experiences\
  \ are mine to keep forever."
