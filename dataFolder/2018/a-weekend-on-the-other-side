Text: "I had connected with the first of my guides, a happy-go-lucky dentist, based\
  \ on shared \u2018origins\u2019. Neither of us though was born in our country of\
  \ shared origin. In fact N had never even lived in Greece but was born and raised\
  \ in Jerusalem\u2019s Old City, and for my part, only half of me is Greek. On this\
  \ basis-the melange of ethnicity and experience-which, as it happens, is typical\
  \ of Jerusalem, we set off East that evening. I was privileged to have found N,\
  \ because the fact he wasn\u2019t Jewish meant he could drive us across the border\
  \ to Arab-inhabited Bethlehem. Far from the images of nativities and cattle-sheds,\
  \ the town was rugged and concrete-lain, with graffiti art abound. Under night\u2019\
  s garb it looked like any other Arab village. My dentist companion inducted me into\
  \ a canopied shisha lounge, where we sat jovially among locals. A Christian-Arab\
  \ friend of his joined us; I believe Henry worked for a tourist agency, but cultural-linguistic\
  \ wires may have been crossed. I\u2019d heard that N had a previous engagement to\
  \ attend briefly, and thought he\u2019d be taking me. However, he smilingly took\
  \ leave of me, entrusting my welfare to Henry. The hookahs were smoked, the sodas\
  \ imbibed, but dear N was nowhere to be seen. It became clear that I was stuck in\
  \ the \u2018City of David\u2019 with Henry. This near stranger, following my new\
  \ friend\u2019s disappearance, was kind enough to put me up in a room of my own\
  \ in the Sahara Hotel, located nextdoor to \u2018Shepherds\u2019 Fields\u2019. After\
  \ staying on sofas in Jerusalem, this was unexpected. The next day Henry, to my\
  \ chagrin, volunteered to be my guide to Shepherds\u2019 Fields; like London\u2019\
  s Shepherd\u2019s Bush, except souvenir shops are better value, and shepherds are\
  \ purported to have rested there while being guided by a star on the way to Jesus\u2019\
  \ manger. There were locals flogging trinkets and flaunting a smattering of various\
  \ languages to whoever approached the gates. They opened to a quaint art deco church\
  \ built in 1936. Inside, I looked at a fresco of a boy carrying an olive branch\
  \ next to the shepherds and their flocks below the gaze of a star. Like an oncoming\
  \ sneeze, I felt a moment of illumination approach but was interrupted by a bumbling\
  \ Henry. As he entered a grotto-church, I scampered off and discovered Byzantine\
  \ digs in the grounds, at which I felt very much in my element. The underground\
  \ caves were cool, and I reflected on the absurd overuse of air conditioning. Here,\
  \ the earth was offering its outer crust as refuge from the Middle Eastern sun."
