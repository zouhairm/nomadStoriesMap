Text: "\"The. 7:25. First Great Western train to London Paddington is delayed.\" a\
  \ disembodied voice crackled through the platform speakers. Drones glued to their\
  \ screens momentarily looked up, saw \"expected 7:57\", shook their heads in compliant\
  \ fury and went back to scrolling through Facebook.\n\nThe oppressive grey skies\
  \ encapsulated my abiding mood. I wistfully sighed, filling the air with the vapours\
  \ of my breath. Through the mist, I saw luscious mountain-sides, sprawling paddy\
  \ fields, sparkling lagoons and majestic temples. That afternoon, I booked a trip\
  \ to Thailand. \n\nHeading to the paradise island of Koh Phi Phi was like drifting\
  \ through a painting of paradise. Colossal rocks, stippled with mesmeric green rose\
  \ from the aquamarine waters like guardians at the gate. I felt like I, along with\
  \ the dozen other backpackers, were about to be let into an enchanted secret.\n\n\
  Instead, I was greeted by a chorus but by hawkers, running after each wooden, long-tail\
  \ boat as it docked, off-loading dozens of backpackers. The beaches were lined with\
  \ tourist information offices, hostel brokers and tour guides. Cut into the mountain,\
  \ was a town bustling with people tucking into a hangover breakfast. Croaky voices\
  \ seeped into the narrow alleyways, exchanging stories from the night before. Shops\
  \ sold sunscreen, condoms and vats of spirits. Promo girls stood outside bars, beckoning\
  \ with promises of pussy shows and fishbowls of Sangsom whiskey.\n\nThe night brought\
  \ a full-moon beach party. Glammed up girls were salivating over surfers with blond\
  \ locks and rippling pectorals. But I saw the locals being ordered around, treated\
  \ like servants, frightened wildlife and pollution floating into the ocean. One\
  \ Thai waiter was so happy I spoke to him, asked about his family and life, he said:\
  \ \"no one ever talks to me\". \n\nThe pinnacle of my stay was a trip to a go-go\
  \ dancing club. Crawling with middle-aged white men, prowling and for young Thai\
  \ girls. They licked their lips in wanton desire as bored looking girls in their\
  \ underwear jiggled on the bar. One girl ran off the stage, heading straight for\
  \ me, she grabbed at my arm with a look of despair in her eyes, \"please, help,\
  \ that man, he want to see me after\" she pleaded. I told her not to worry, I would\
  \ distract him so she could get away. Off I trotted to chat with this man, who looked\
  \ through me. When I saw she made her escape, I asked what he what his agenda was.\
  \ Little did I know he had the bouncers in his pocket."
