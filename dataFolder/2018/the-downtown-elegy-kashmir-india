Text: "BLACK AND WHITE:\n\nSaleem had left through the arc of Zaina Kadal Bridge,\
  \ in the middle of the arc he was mostly vivid in eye but when he went from the\
  \ middle to the other end slowly becoming invisible down the arc, he was hopelessly\
  \ gone ...I realized. \n\nI was walking through a road from Fateh Kadal, an area\
  \ named after a bridge, to Khankah; it\u2019s a road that looks mysterious with\
  \ the mixture of Old and new houses on its sides, old and dark houses, new and luminous\
  \ houses, at this time. It was 4:30 pm when I looked into my watch. Sun was going\
  \ dim early as the weather rules of winter commanded it.\n\nThis road reveals newer\
  \ vistas of surprise at nearly every ten meters in the form of lanes that go through\
  \ all the way like capillaries from a bigger vein. Never had I thought this lazy\
  \ loitering would get me meet people that I will never forget.\n\nFateh Kadal before\
  \ this road is also some what eerie, the Old houses that Pundits once resided are\
  \ breaking up, I saw many houses, highest stories of which had fallen down, and\
  \ they were like that telling their own tale by mere presence. Saleem lives in one\
  \ such house, as I later on got to know.\n\nOther houses here are black with the\
  \ soot of fire, from the outside, overshadowed by much darker and \u2018haunted\u2019\
  \ inside. Besides that there are other surprises ones eyes may meet through out\
  \ the journey: people may welcome you with the unintentional throwing of dirt and\
  \ wrappers through small, old, fenced windows, open drains may also be uncomfortable,\
  \ and a skeptical old man may inquire you out of blue, as it happened to me: everything\
  \ about downtown is classic, and raw.\n\nI reached Khankah, a name of a shrine that\
  \ was taken in as the name of that area; bridges, shrines, and other remarkable\
  \ spots become the identification of whole area, as it happens in every other part\
  \ of the world. The bridges in downtown are all over the Jehlum River that  ...\
  \ to be continued."
