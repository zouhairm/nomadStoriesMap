Text: "They say it\u2019s a land where elves watch over you. I can\u2019t say what\
  \ I was before, but I certainly became a believer one fateful night driving along\
  \ the icy backcountry roads in Iceland. \n\nMy partner and I were on a quest to\
  \ see the Northern Lights in Iceland. We were on our second night\u2019s pursuit\
  \ from our base in Laugarvatn on the Golden Circle. Tired from driving aimlessly,\
  \ we were speeding along a lonely backcountry road past midnight. \n\nSuddenly the\
  \ car gave a huge leap and started jumping out of control.  For what seemed like\
  \ eternity, but must have been less than half a minute, the car swiveled furiously,\
  \ jolting us towards the icy ditches on either side of the road. And then \u2013\
  \ it stopped. Stepping out of the car with my shaking legs, my foot slipped on the\
  \ ice and I realized how foolish we had been driving so fast. To this day I have\
  \ no idea how the car stopped or how we were unscathed \u2013 I can only surmise\
  \ that elves were watching over us. \n\nThat very night, reaching the Icelandic\
  \ horses at the base of the hill leading up to the farmhouse, my partner inexplicably\
  \ said \"Stop the car and get out\".\n\nPuzzled, I did what he said. To my amazement\
  \ the sky directly above us had the most amazing glow. Brilliant rivers of dancing\
  \ lights seemed to be in motion - swaying, kissing, flaring, flowing. Like lights\
  \ bands swaying in the wind, they would interact and then flare out in a multitude\
  \ of colors. Nothing that I had ever seen in pictures or videos could have prepared\
  \ me for the breathtaking display that nature put on.\n\nLater on, my partner too\
  \ could not explain why he had felt the need to step out of the car just then. He\
  \ just had. \n\nA couple of days later our car was hit by another car being driven\
  \ by a pair of young twins. Much to our amusement, the lady at the rental car office,\
  \ after hearing our description pulled up her facebook account and brought up the\
  \ profile of the very same twins! We couldn't stop laughing! - they truly were a\
  \ country where everybody knew each other! The police and rental people were so\
  \ apologetic and helpful even though it was not them who had hit our car. \n\nComing\
  \ out of Iceland I couldn\u2019t help feeling \u2013 this trip had turned out to\
  \ be so much more than just that \u2013 celestial powers had protected us and had\
  \ filled our hearts, and Icelanders had thoroughly charmed us all throughout. Just\
  \ like the northern lights that left a green glow long after the fireworks, the\
  \ memory of those few days left a glow in my heart for years to come."
