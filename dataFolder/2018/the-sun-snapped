Text: "I was 4, I was curious, I was excited! My dad told me that we are going to\
  \ visit my grandparents. They used to leave in the middle of mountains as they kept\
  \ bees always needing a new flowers and flavors (now I know girls need the same\
  \ things as bees). What was so special in that day? Everything... My little feet\
  \ first time in their life had to walk 30 km, and of course, I was ready! I took\
  \ with me a song for my dad, as I wanted him not to get tired, and I took a smile\
  \ with me for lighting the road. It was the first day of my life, the very first\
  \ one, as I remember no day before. We walked around two hours, I mean I didn't\
  \ walk that much, because my dad hugged me from time to time telling me stories\
  \ about plants that were so curios to see the sun, stones that \"remembered times\
  \ when people didn\u2019t have the language to sing songs\" and the old airdrome\
  \ that kept a small city connected to the world in USSR. I was born in USSR but\
  \ as my brother always says: \"even such a powerful country got destroyed when you\
  \ were born, what can I expect from your toys?\" So, after two hours I was starving,\
  \ and we ate all snacks my mom had put with us. One would say, that it was irresponsible\
  \ from my father\u2019s perspectives, but it's not true, as he was planning to meet\
  \ someone on the way and then go by car, but that someone didn't show up (I am happy,\
  \ he didn't). We climbed a small hill and saw the hayloft, the valley with hundreds\
  \ of herbal cones that looked like someone was doing a geometric experiment. When\
  \ you leave in a small town everyone knows each other, so obviously our town wasn\u2019\
  t an exception and I ended up eating tomatoes and cheese rolled in Armenian traditional\
  \ bred -lavash. Never again I had so delicious tomatoes, I remember the smell, the\
  \ moment when semi-sweet red slices melted in my mouth and the joy of laying on\
  \ the freshly cut grass, looking at the clouds of hundred shapes and trying to guess,\
  \ what\u2019s there? We continued sometimes with people by car, and even once by\
  \ a poor donkey, we were free, we had wings and the life full of songs\u2026 It\
  \ was an amazing sunset when we reached my grandparents and we were drinking a tee\
  \ with a fresh honey the same color as a sunset, as the sun snapped, and the world\
  \ was born. It was a time, when there was nothing in Armenia, all factories were\
  \ closed, no electricity, no heat, no hope\u2026 When I see my dad, whose hair is\
  \ grey now and eyes are looking back I feel the power of mountains and think I am\
  \ 4 and I am curious."
