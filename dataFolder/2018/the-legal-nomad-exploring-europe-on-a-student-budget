Text: "Having had the opportunity to travel abroad to further my studies i told myself\
  \ i would maximise it and see the world. i have always been one person who ne\xB4\
  ver liked the idea of staying in one place for too long. my family can attest to\
  \ that, i was born in one town and grew up in6 different towns across Zimbabwe.\
  \ When the time came for me to leave my home country i travelled between Zimbabwe\
  \ and South Africa for 5 years and never in the same place for a long time. Hence\
  \ the name, the legal nomad! So i got an opportunity to go to Sweden for my Master\
  \ degree. I was excited and couldn't wait for the adventures that awaited. The moment\
  \ i stepped into Sweden I sought to travel as much as possible, taking advantage\
  \ of the student discounts on boat cruises and cheap flights. I went to Estonia,\
  \ Denmark and upon the festive season i had to decide my next destination. i have\
  \ to admit, it wasn't easy. Then i had a lightbulb moment, Poland it was, Gdansk!\
  \ We chose new year's eve as our departure date.\xB4i still restled in my mind on\
  \ whether this was the best decision, becoming sceptic about the choice of destination,\
  \ having heard nothing about the place. we got there just a few hours before midnight\
  \ and were adviced to go to the town centre to experience the fireworks and a free\
  \ concert! The people we came across were amazing and there was food being sold\
  \ along the main street! The food always says it all. My first fireworks experience\
  \ in Europe, i have to admit, i felt like a kid. the show was awesome, We were just\
  \ taking selfies with random people. we felt so welcome. the next day our hostel\
  \ manager adviced us to go to Sopot, there we saw the crooked house and had my first\
  \ waffle filled with chocolate and wipped cream! the beach was warm and beautiful,\
  \ considering it was winter. as if that was not enough we set for szymbark (the\
  \ upside house featured in the amazing race)!! We took the bus as it was an hour\
  \ away from Gdansk. In the bus we met a couple who were also headed the same way.\
  \ Getting off the bus we took the wrong turn and ended up walking for 3 kms to get\
  \ to the place, in that cold  we found excitement. we walked in the fog and talked\
  \ about all the scary things that happen in a fogy woody place like we see in movies.\
  \ the house went fa beyond our expectations and the inside made us feel a bity whoozy\
  \ with the upside furniture. it turned out to be the best decision i have evr made\
  \ and i promised myself i will go on undecided trips more often and let my mind\
  \ be blown away by surprises."
