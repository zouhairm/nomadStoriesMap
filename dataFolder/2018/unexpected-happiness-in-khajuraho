Text: "I hadn\u2019t planned to go to Khajuraho, the known destination of the \u201C\
  Kama Sutra temples\u201D I wasn\u2019t in India to gawk at sexual depictions of\
  \ gods and bulls, and goddesses. I was there to have my off the \"beaten path, semi-spiritual,\
  \ authentic India experience\". Then I met Marina, my new, extremely persuasive\
  \ Bulgarian travel partner who insisted on seeing the temples. We planned to travel\
  \ together by train to Agra, Khajuraho, Varanasi, and Darjeeling, then we would\
  \ part ways and I would stay in the North while Marina ventured South. \n\nThe old,\
  \ charming Khajuraho hotel we stayed in was adorned in vines climbing the white\
  \ balconies, their crimson flowers blooming on every floor. \nOutside the hotel\
  \ was a chaiwala stand where we satisfied our fully developed, and not unwelcome\
  \ addictions. From there we walked to the temples in the center of town. I was amazed\
  \ by the intricacy of the tiny, sexual sculptures carved in the temple walls, and\
  \ by the photogenic qualities of the women\u2019s bright saris against the faded\
  \ ochre stone. \n\nThat afternoon at the chaiwala stand, a young named Akosh man\
  \ asked me in impeccable English if I had seen the lesser know temples just outside\
  \ the city. He lamented that many people do not, despite their being as culturally\
  \ significant and as attractive as the others.  \"Are they easy to find\" I asked.\
  \ \"I will show you if you'd like\" he replied. The next morning, Marina, Akosh,\
  \ his friend Laki, and I rode bicycles to the temples, admiring the stonework, the\
  \ creativity, and the stories that inspired the works, one after another. \n\nBeing\
  \ able to admire these centuries-old testaments to humanity's need to create that\
  \ which we envision, in empty fields of golden grasses, amongst new friends, was\
  \ an afternoon to be grateful for. Towards the end of the day, Laki offered to take\
  \ us to his grandfather's house to make dinner. We stopped at the small market at\
  \ the edge of town to pick up vegetables and rode to Laki's grandfather's modest\
  \ house. \n\nHis grandfather graciously showed us his methods of peeling aubergines,\
  \ starting a fire, and slapping chapatis into rounds, or in my case into \"the shape\
  \ of India\" as the old man proclaimed. The simple baigan barta we made was one\
  \ of the more memorable meals I had in India, and in my life since that twilight\
  \ dinner beneath the Neem trees. As female travelers, we were wary of these young\
  \ men at first, but in our five days they showed us fireflies, a Hindu wedding,\
  \ and nothing but immense friendship."
