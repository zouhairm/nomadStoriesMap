Text: "Living in Colorado for the past two years on and off has gotten me more and\
  \ more into the outdoors.  The mountains have become my best friend.  The issue\
  \ with that, though, is you don\u2019t always have somebody to go with when you\
  \ (frequently) want to wake up at 3am to climb a 14er.  Luckily, I am more than\
  \ comfortable doing things on my own, thanks to my solo travels the past few years.\n\
  \nOver a holiday this summer, I did my first solo camping trip to Bears Ears National\
  \ Monument in Utah.  I chose to do it alone as I had some reflecting to do, and\
  \ my parents were not happy about me going it alone in the great outdoors as a girl.\
  \  Having full confidence in myself to be able to safely camp for a few nights alone\
  \ (and my boyfriend\u2019s confidence in me, too), I packed up my cooler full of\
  \ food and Rubbermaid full of gear, hopped in my car and continued on my merry way,\
  \ sending a few \u201CI\u2019m alive\u201D texts to my mom each day.\n\nLeading\
  \ up to the trip, my parents tried to dissuade me from going.  After multiple failed\
  \ attempts, my mom bluntly said in a conversation one day, \u201CYou can\u2019t\
  \ camp by yourself as a girl.  That\u2019s just how it is.\u201D.  Absolutely not.\
  \  Nothing, absolutely nothing, should hold you back from the outdoors because you\
  \ are a female.  And nothing, absolutely nothing, can make me more mad than that\
  \ statement did.  I was 100% going by myself after that.\n\nUpon returning, I felt\
  \ refreshed and really, truly proud of myself of all that I saw and accomplished\
  \ over the holiday weekend.  That Bears Ears trip was probably my favorite adventure\
  \ of summer 2017.  So no matter how you do it, the important thing is that you do\
  \ it and you don\u2019t let being a female hold you back.  Just use your common\
  \ sense and good judgment to assess situations, as you would anywhere.  Heck, I\
  \ slept with a whistle and hatchet next to me the first night alone in a tent, and\
  \ moved to the car after a few hours because I\u2019m an actual adult that is still\
  \ actually afraid of the dark.  The next night, I was able to ditch the hatchet\
  \ and stayed comfortably in my tent all night.  I\u2019m working at my own pace\
  \ up to what I know I can do, and I\u2019m not letting any of the stereotypes against\
  \ me being a girl stop me.\n\nNo matter how you get outside, just get outside. \
  \ Don\u2019t be afraid to push yourself, don\u2019t let anything hold you back and\
  \ keep on being badass, ladies."
