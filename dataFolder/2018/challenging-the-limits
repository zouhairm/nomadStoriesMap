Text: "When you love adventure you\u2019re in a constant state of excitement and have\
  \ a desire to do something thrilling and challenging. That\u2019s the state I was\
  \ in when I planned a two day cycling trip with my brother when we were in Nepal.\
  \ I was elated but a little anxious due to the reality that I hadn\u2019t even touched\
  \ my own bike back in India for more than 5 years. Nevertheless, I shrugged off\
  \ my fears and went to rent a bike. We started early in the morning with the cycling\
  \ route in our minds. The route was a popular one as it passes a national park if\
  \ you ride for 32KM. We kept up a good pace, riding up and down hills, one after\
  \ another and passing through several villages with people smiling as we went by.\
  \ My legs started hurting but the beauty of the place distracted me from my pain\
  \ and brought me to think of my past, of how before the trip I was in a rut, dull\
  \ and depressed. However, these thoughts were interrupted as I noticed a subtle,\
  \ yet persistently increasing incline of the trail and that the landscape was becoming\
  \ denser and greener. We decided to take a break and I asked for directions from\
  \ a stranger nearby. I discovered we had completed around 21KM of the distance\u2013\
  I was surprised by my own capabilities. Smiling, and yet in a lot of pain, we resumed\
  \ the journey on foot, ascending once more toward the clouds with mixed thoughts\
  \ in my mind. Completing 32KM and entering Kakani, the highest village and our final\
  \ stop of the day, we saw a bunch of kids playing soccer on a field which looked\
  \ like it was floating, overlooking the icy peaks of the Himalayas. The smiling\
  \ children made me realize the simplicity of life. Later, we checked into our hotel\
  \ and celebrated with beer before sleeping in our muddy and bloody clothes. The\
  \ next day the trail lead us towards the national park, entering the jungle through\
  \ a big gate guarded by army men. It was all downhill from now on, with incredibly\
  \ thin tracks winding through lush green forest and passing many waterfalls. Exiting\
  \ the Area we were on our way back to our hostel.\nOn the way back, passing new\
  \ villages, I began reflecting on my time in Nepal and how I thought that my first\
  \ bungee jump or canyoning would be the highlight of this trip. But this simple\
  \ cycling trip took the prize; Pushing me immensely not only physically with a total\
  \ 64KM of cycling but also making me acknowledge the emotions I was not able to\
  \ face earlier. Changing my attitude towards life with the changing altitude, one\
  \ realization at a time."
