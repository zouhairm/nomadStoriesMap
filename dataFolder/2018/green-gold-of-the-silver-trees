Text: "\"Lotte e Lilla, come i fiori.\" the man gazed at me, puckering his brows.\
  \ He hesitated if he should trust the curious travellers, with strange names of\
  \ flowers, begging to enter his empire. For a second I thought he would say 'no'.\
  \ Then his grim wrinkles disappeared. He smiled. Though that November night fell\
  \ early, I felt a hearthwarming, light sunshine. He took my hand, and nodded. \"\
  Follow me, flower girls.\"\n\nDark as coal, smooth as silk, olives, here you go.\
  \ Lotte, my German friend did not speak Italian but understood the welcoming gestures\
  \ of our guide. I translated when Giuseppe introduced us the olive mill, a real\
  \ Italian frantoio. Cause (no surprise, I am a journalist) seeing was not enough!\
  \ I wanted to touch, to ask, to smell, to discover. And luckily my friend joined\
  \ me in the dark, when we took the stairs to the first floor. \n\n\"Our journey\
  \ begins here.\" old Giuseppe explained. \"The crane that you saw outside lifts\
  \ up the olives here, through the open windows. Then the machine selects all leaves,\
  \ branches and trash. Cleaning is essential, so the berries go to bath. The extraction\
  \ process happens downstairs all around, after the olives were pressed and malaxed\
  \ into a paste. Next phase, the oil gets separated from the vegetable water.\"\n\
  \nBarrels, tanks, pipes. An ancient mechanism with modern tools wriggled all around\
  \ the ample medieval rooms. Giuseppe offered us a few drops of the greenish elixir.\
  \ We could not refuse! I holded the tiny, white cup close to my nose. By covering,\
  \ I warmed it up. I sipped. It felt fresh, natural, creamy. \n\n\"A general technique\
  \ before tasting: to clean your throath with apple or with regional, unsalted bread.\
  \ You know, we consider art appraising the stories of the oil. You can guess the\
  \ quality, savour, seasons, origin of the plant.\" \n\nI understood what Giuseppe\
  \ was meaning. I am from Hungary. In my homeland we do not have olives but I always\
  \ dreamt about learning the know-how of making the precious mediterranean product.\
  \ And since I have been volunteer in a Central Italian bio farm, I had the honour\
  \ to take part in each step of the harvest. Preparations included fixing the green\
  \ nets (sewing) where the fruits fall. At the harvest I had to be very handy climbing\
  \ the trees to reach with a plastic rake the black olives among the silver leaves.\n\
  \n\"Days are long, work is hard, and I have another dream. I wish to travel.\" Giuseppe\
  \ said good-bye to us. I kept quiet, and thought how lucky I was to live my dream."
