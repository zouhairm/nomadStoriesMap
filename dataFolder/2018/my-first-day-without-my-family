Text: Finally i made my first trip for Rajasthan and     my family was not accepting
  to go for trip but traveling is my lifeline , whenever i get chance i never want
  to leave that , so i somehow managed to go but i was not having money because my
  family didn't gave me a single coin, 15 days before the trip i worked in mall and
  night work to somehow earn money , at trip day i had 15 thousands and few extra
  money and i went there , i didn't took room or any hotels to stay , i was just roaming
  there places to places , i use to sleep in temple and other place in that 10 days
  i experience a lots of things and the most remembered thing was when i was in jaipur
  i saw few people and they were not good at all , they saw me and i was fully sure
  that they was after my miney and my bag , so i ran so fast , while running i was
  not knowing what should i do  i ran for more then 30 minutes then i got inside city
  and few people saw me and helped me , i am so much thankful to those people , then
  i explored place and many other things
