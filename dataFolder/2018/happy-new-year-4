Text: "It was the 1st Jan and I had decided to do my first multipitch rock climb in\
  \ Todra Gorge, Morocco. At around 500m it consists of 10 pitches.\n\nWe set off\
  \ early in the morning so that we would have plenty of time. However we were slowed\
  \ down by the couple in front of us, so it took longer than we expected. \n\nWhen\
  \ the sun is down in the desert it becomes bitterly cold, I couldn\u2019t feel my\
  \ fingers anymore. I was placing my hands on the rock and blindly trusting them.\
  \ It\u2019s hard to trust holding something when you can\u2019t feel it. \n\nMy\
  \ hands were shredded, the rock was sharp, and my shoes were giving up on me, the\
  \ rock slicing a hole through the rubber. \n\nI remember the exact moment when night\
  \ fell. We were on the 9th pitch, and the sun was setting. My partner, Nes told\
  \ me she had forgotten her head torch, so she set on her way quickly to lead the\
  \ next pitch before it became too dark. However we were soon to learn that in the\
  \ desert when the sun sets, night falls quickly. By the time she was half way up\
  \ I could hear her crying in the dark. \n\nShe later told me she had found a little\
  \ ledge, large enough to perch herself on, and hugged a rock while she panicked.\
  \ \n\nIt wouldn\u2019t have been such a problem if the route was straight. But the\
  \ route zigzagged and rarely finished directly above the starting point. That means\
  \ extra drag from the rope.  It pulls you down. When your route isn\u2019t straight\
  \ and there\u2019s no light, it means you can\u2019t see your bolts. We missed quite\
  \ a few, even when we did have light.\n\nNes managed to pull herself together, she\
  \ soldiered on. I climbed up to meet her and started to lead the final pitch. My\
  \ head torch gave barely enough light to see the way.\n\nA perfect way to start\
  \ the year!\n\nThe reddish brown stone absorbs the sun\nThe reddish brown rock that\
  \ I climb for fun\n\nIts pointed spikes and sharp edges\nCut through my skin as\
  \ hang from ledges\n\nMy fingers taped-up to stop the blood\nIt\u2019s hard to believe\
  \ that through this gorge \nThere was once a flood\nOf water, that cut through stone,\
  \ \nIn this now dry desert \n\nWe set off early morning, with a cold air\nNow I\
  \ feel then sun burning through my hair\n\nA Harness, slings and 80 metres of rope\n\
  A dozen draws and 4 souls full of hope. \n\nWe finished in the dark, under a starry\
  \ sky\nAfter 8 hours of climbing, had passed us by\n\nTired tears, and vanished\
  \ fears\nFingers frayed, but mission made \n\nI wish I could say, that when we reached\
  \ the top \nIt was an amazing sight\nBut instead we could see nothing,\nFor it was\
  \ night."
