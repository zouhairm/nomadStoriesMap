Text: "Tabaqui, Rudyard Kipling\u2019s jackal from Jungle Book, is a mischief maker\
  \ that runs about telling tales. So charmed was I by his dewanee or madness that\
  \ visions of him came unbidden as I crept up to the hidden waterhole. I was deep\
  \ in the Pench forest of Seoni, in a sunflower coloured dawn. \u201CWho do we have\
  \ there? See that jackal!\u201D exclaimed Gunga Prasad, my guide from the local\
  \ village.  Lo and behold, it was Tabaqui himself crouching silent in the grass!\
  \ Oh, that gossipmonger! \nTo rewind, I was introduced to Bagheera and Baloo, long\
  \ before I could read, courtesy a marketing promotion found under the bottle cap\
  \ of my favourite orange soda. You drank the sugary contents and collected enough\
  \ caps to redeem stickers with Jungle Book pictures. Like a forlorn duckling imprinting\
  \ onto humans, I came to believe that I was related to woodland animals.\nIt was\
  \ only decades later that I read the original text, while on my way to Seoni where\
  \ the book is set. In its opening pages, little Tabaqui looks on as Mother Wolf\
  \ faces down a dastardly Shere Khan and rescues Mowgli. The sticky pages of my childhood\
  \ and Scarlett Johansson\u2019s Kaa had done little to prepare me for either the\
  \ earthy quality of Kipling\u2019s original or for discovering the timeless magic\
  \ of Seoni through Gunga\u2019s eyes.\nA flash of golden yellow startled us. \u201C\
  Black hooded orioles,\u201D said Gunga, without needing the binoculars that hung\
  \ around my neck. \u201CDid you know that tiger-hued tree pies pick food from between\
  \ the big cats\u2019 teeth?\u201D he queried, when a harsh cry sounded above. \u201C\
  Used to make matchsticks,\u201D he declared, pausing at a wooden trunk, which to\
  \ my urban eyes looked remarkably like the hundred others in the vicinity. \u201C\
  Here smell these,\u201D he instructed, crushing leaves from a bush, \u201Ctobacco\
  \ is a natural mosquito repellent.\u201D And so he continued, commenting on coppersmith\
  \ barbets and white bellied drongos, on the hoof prints near a natural salt lick,\
  \ and on the delicate balance of humans and forest ecosystems. He spun yarns of\
  \ the cattle stealer Shere Khan and of Mang the bat.  I was drawn in, tighter and\
  \ tighter.\nThey say that anything can happen in the light trapped in the dusty\
  \ motes of dawn. There appeared, for a split second, a hair-like tear in the fabric\
  \ of time and space. Misty wreaths revealed the wolf pack gathered at the rock.\
  \ Ikki the porcupine bristled at the Bandar Log. Tabaqui\u2019s eyes gleamed sly.\
  \ And mixed into the green scents of the wood, was the unmistakable smell of a child\u2019\
  s orange soda."
