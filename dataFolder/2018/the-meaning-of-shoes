Text: "Her face was expressionless when she sat down at my table. I put some of the\
  \ meat I had ordered on a second plate and pushed it in front of her.\nShe was thin,\
  \ I realized.  I could see her bones shine through her skin, dark and wrinkled from\
  \ the sun. It was hanging off her bones just like her oversized shirt was hanging\
  \ off her body. \n\u201CWhat\u2019s your name?\u201D I asked. \n\u201CMariana,\u201D\
  \ she replied, distracted. She was concentrating on her food. \n\u201CNice to meet\
  \ you, Mariana\u201D For a second she glanced at me, then continued eating. \u201C\
  Is it good?\u201D \nShe nodded. Her nails were bitten to the quick, her hands were\
  \ dirty.\n\u201CPeople think I\u2019d use their money for drugs,\u201D she said.\u201D\
  \ I\u2019d never do that. I\u2019ve got two kids.\u201D \nI blushed. I had also\
  \ wanted to keep my change in my pocket for fear of supporting a drug habit. Then\
  \ she told me her story. \n\nMariana was an exile. Her family had lived in a small\
  \ house in the mountains before the Guerilla fighters came. They took their land\
  \ and used it to plant coca leaves. Her husband was killed. Her father too. She\
  \ had to take her children and leave and they were never to come back. Now they\
  \ lived at the outskirts of the city in a little house made out of cardboard and\
  \ plastic.\n\nI tried to analyse Mar\xEDa\u2019s expression. She was neither angry\
  \ nor sad. Speaking about her life seemed to be about as interesting to her as mentioning\
  \ the suffocating heat in the city that never yielded.\n\nThe kids did not go to\
  \ school, she explained to me. They needed uniforms and black shoes to attend. \u201C\
  Our neighbor gave some black shoes to my girl.\u201D For the first time her eyes\
  \ brightened up. \u201CNow the boy is jealous...Siblings,\u201C she giggled. \u201C\
  He'll also have a pair of black shoes, soon.\u201D Her smile disappeared replaced\
  \ by the same apathetic expression as before. She stood up ready to leave. \u201C\
  The kids are waiting.\u201D\nShe did not even finish her meal.\n\nFive months later\
  \ I was ready to leave the city. My suitcase was already packed as I sat down for\
  \ lunch on the terrace of my favourite restaurant. A woman approached me to ask\
  \ for change. I looked up. Her face was expressionless, her skin dark and wrinkled\
  \ from the sun.\n\u201CMariana!\u201D I exclaimed.\n\nUnsure whether it was coincidence\
  \ or fate that we would meet one last time, I asked her to wait for me and immediately\
  \ ran home to bring her some of my old clothes and some school materials, but when\
  \ I returned, Mariana had already gone. I realised then, that in all my excitement\
  \ I hadn't even thought to ask whether her son already owned a pair of black shoes."
