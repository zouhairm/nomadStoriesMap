Text: "The afternoon sky was thick with the haze of distant wildfires, the Canadian\
  \ Rockies barely visible to the east. With my camera tucked under my arm, I scanned\
  \ the expanse of pavement between the gas station and the fast food joint, looking\
  \ for an Argentinian. \n\nPeople of all sorts passed by. This was precisely why\
  \ I\u2019d come, why I\u2019d spent many hot afternoons in this gigantic, busy parking\
  \ lot. It was a summer of work for me, not the time to travel to faraway lands,\
  \ but a season to store up energy and funds for future adventuring. Missing the\
  \ excitement of life on the road, and the fleeting connections with passing strangers,\
  \ I crafted a plan. I would make 101 portraits of travellers passing through my\
  \ little town in the mountains of British Columbia. \n\nThe project pushed me to\
  \ stride up to people from Uganda, Jordan, the UK, and Pakistan. We\u2019d chat,\
  \ I\u2019d take their photo, they\u2019d continue their travels, I\u2019d go home\
  \ and wonder what the weather was like in Karachi. When travel is not on the table,\
  \ make friends with people from far off lands and let the imagination wander. \n\
  \nIt was the vehicle that made me wait, a Toyota 4Runner stickered from head to\
  \ tail, with plates that seemed proud to state A R G E N T I N A. I lingered nearby,\
  \ waiting for the driver of what had to be a great story. Afternoon stretched into\
  \ evening, the peachy sky turned orange. Eventually they came, a pair, spent after\
  \ a hot day on the road. Or as it turned out, spent after a full year and a half\
  \ on the road, as they'd been driving from Argentina to Alaska and back again. Marcos\
  \ and Noelia. \n\nWe chatted in Spanish, an unexpected treat for each of us. Recalling\
  \ the many times I\u2019ve been welcomed into homes around the world, and how each\
  \ unexpected invitation bolstered my faith in humanity, I invited them home for\
  \ the night. They said s\xED, c\xF3mo no. \n\nWe left the bustle of the Trans-Canada\
  \ Highway, drove through what I call \u2018our ugly little town\u2019 for its dusty,\
  \ vinyl-sided homes, even though Golden BC sits amongst some of the most beautiful\
  \ mountains in the world. We passed over the turquoise blue of the Kicking Horse\
  \ River, turned right on 13th and parked in front of the moss-covered cherry tree.\
  \ We made a simple pasta meal together, drank wine, and shared photos of adventures\
  \ past and present. When they left in the morning, we felt like old old friends,\
  \ and I was reminded of the merits of paying it forward."
