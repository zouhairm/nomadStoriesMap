Text: "It's everyone's worst nightmare for something to go wrong while traveling;\
  \ whether it be lost luggage or a cancelled flight, there are countless things that\
  \ can disrupt an already stressful ordeal. Now add the fact that it's your first\
  \ time flying without parental supervision and you and your friends did not account\
  \ for things to go wrong. \nIt was the summer of 2016, I had just graduated high\
  \ school and a couple close friends and I decided to take a trip to Los Angeles.\
  \ Kind of a graduation present mixed with our last hurrah before university kicked\
  \ us in the butt. The flight there went without a hitch and we had a great time\
  \ soaking up the sun and even attending a concert. However the journey back was\
  \ going to be anything but smooth. \nOur flight was due to leave at 3pm, so we arrived\
  \ at LAX with lots of time to spare only to discover a delay due to bad weather\
  \ in Calgary (we had a connection there). No big deal right? Unfortunately with\
  \ over a two hour push over, we didn't end up taking off until well after 5pm. \n\
  We touched down in Calgary a little after nine.....and our connecting flight was\
  \ set to depart at 9:30. By this point all three of us were panicking, as there\
  \ was almost no way we were going to make it off the plane and through security\
  \ in time. \nAs we were going through security, everything suddenly stops. Now on\
  \ the verge of a full on freak out, I turn to my friends like \"Oh my god we aren't\
  \ going to make it.\" \nAfter what felt like eternity, security starts moving again\
  \ and we get all of our stuff, with the serene ambiance of last chance boarding\
  \ calls for our flight going off in the background. \nThere's no time to spare,\
  \ so I pick up my shoes and opt to run through the airport in just my socks. It\
  \ must have been a pretty funny sight to see: three teenage girls racing down the\
  \ hall, juggling bags and me without sneakers on. \nWe make it to our gate where\
  \ everyone has already boarded and the doors are closed and we beg the woman to\
  \ let us on. She tells us she has to check to see if we're allowed then comes back\
  \ and tells us to run as fast as we can. \nSo once again (and I'm still sans shoes)\
  \ we race down the ramp and stumble into the plane looking disheveled and earning\
  \ the stink eye from both the crew and passengers for making them wait. We later\
  \ found out we were the only three from our previous flight to have made it.\nI\
  \ learned two things that day: one, connecting flights suck and two, thin cotton\
  \ socks do not make for good running footwear."
