Text: "Venice, the city of bridges, the city of masks, the city where I fell into\
  \ a canal.\n \nTwo things I\u2019d heard about Venice: expect constant crowds, and\
  \ embrace being lost.\n \nGetting lost is part of the magic, the guides said, so\
  \ wander freely.\n \nExiting the ferry, I immediately saw the part about crowds\
  \ was true. In midst of a three-week solo trip, I was lonely, and disliked the jostling\
  \ crowds. I would try to see the famous Piazza San Marco later, I decided. For now-\
  \ I needed some magic. Keeping my phone with its map in my pocket, I twisted through\
  \ charming stone alleyways. Eventually, I found myself in a courtyard with no other\
  \ exit except an archway looking down into a canal. I crossed to it to look for\
  \ gondolas and magic.\n \nInstead, I fell in.\n \nTwo things I wish I\u2019d heard\
  \ about Venice: slippery algae grow along the edges of walkways, and falling into\
  \ a canal happens very fast.\n \nAfter splashing around for a few shocked moments\
  \ in the murky water, I clambered back up through the archway. On solid ground,\
  \ I assessed: I was soaking wet with a bruised arm and a bruised ego, but my belongings\
  \ were dry inside my purse. Then- I remembered my phone. I clawed at my pocket but\
  \ realized it was now empty. The sickening realization flooded me that my phone\
  \ had fallen out, all of my photos, travel plans, and ability to communicate sunken\
  \ to the bottom of the canal.\n \nWhat next, after one loses her phone falling into\
  \ a canal in Venice? A shower. I resisted panic and found my way back to the ferry,\
  \ keeping my eyes straight ahead all the way to my hostel. What next, after a shower?\
  \ A drink. I sat down at the hostel bar and ordered an Aperol Spritz.\n \n\u201C\
  How are you?\u201D asked the girl next to me, American, friendly face. I burst into\
  \ tears.\n \nSoon, a small, international support group had gathered around me.\
  \ The story grew funnier with each telling. The American said, \u201CI have an Ipad\
  \ you can use and mail to me after your trip.\u201D A Swiss said, \u201CLet\u2019\
  s get dinner.\u201D \n\nBack to the ferry- this time dry, surrounded by new friends,\
  \ and filled with warmth over unexpected generosity. The ferry was followed by pasta,\
  \ by wine, by dancing. Later, sometime very late, we walked through empty streets,\
  \ lost, laughing, until we turned a corner and found ourselves in Piazza San Marco.\
  \ The ornate buildings and statues gleamed white and breathtaking. The square was\
  \ empty, except for us. \n \nFor one shimmering hour, on the day I fell into a canal,\
  \ Venice belonged only to us.\n \nIt was magic."
