Text: "An adventure. An experience. Only three days. \nDave and I had met 5 days earlier.\
  \ A lifetime in backpacker language.  We were now well into the nitty, gritty territory\
  \ you only discuss with people you think you\u2019ll never see again. \nWe decided\
  \ to hike into the depths of China to see a glacier that came \u2018highly recommended\u2019\
  . It should be a walk in the park.\nOf course, we were prepared \u2013 clothed in\
  \ jeans, a t-shirt, and with a small backpack filled with water and an elephant\
  \ trunk shaped G-string.  The essentials really.\nSurrounded by Chinese tourists\
  \ that looked like they were about to climb Base Camp, the hike looked relatively\
  \ easy \u2013 just your run of the mill cardio workout.  A few hours later found\
  \ us up top and feeling accomplished when a tourist asked if he could \u2018take\
  \ a photo\u2019 of us.  \nWe hardly knew each other and were now posing for this\
  \ customary tourist pic trying to awkwardly find a suitable stance that involved\
  \ minimal body contact.\nWe started to descend back towards our latest version of\
  \ home when Dave piped up that he was on a mission and trundled off to take a picture\
  \ in his elephant thong.\nStaggering behind I lost balance on a small, non-descript\
  \ stone and felt my ankle give way as I lurched to the ground, sprawled amongst\
  \ the boulders. Agony surged through my body and I started yelling.  Dave ran from\
  \ the corner and struggling to form sentences, I pointed to my ankle curled beneath\
  \ me and repeated \u201COuch!\u201D over and over.\nHe straightened it from underneath\
  \ me and scared to look I peered over my shoulder expecting to see chaos. It looked\
  \ completely fine.\nI stood up and attempted to walk.  Cursing, my screams rang\
  \ out through the small village of Yubeng. \nStaring at each other, silently debating\
  \ just how we were going to descend he declared \u201CI\u2019m going to have to\
  \ carry you then.\u201D\nMy pride locked in and I refused. I was a grown woman,\
  \ who had eaten her fair share of dumplings over the last 3 months in culinary China\
  \ and I would rather crawl back to safety than make a poor, Northern lad piggy me\
  \ down from a Glacier.\nI stepped forward and more obscenities spewed forth from\
  \ my native Aussie tongue. I swallowed my pride and clambered aboard. \nAs I wrapped\
  \ my legs around Dave\u2019s waist, digging in with all the inner thigh strength\
  \ I could muster, I gripped his sweaty chest for dear life and had to laugh as I\
  \ remembered mere minutes earlier my self-conscious refusal to place my arm around\
  \ him.\nA three-day hike I thought.\nA broken leg was the last thing I expected."
