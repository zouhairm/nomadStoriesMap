Text: "It was the first time that I went away from home to work in a foreign country.\
  \ I saw the first houses from the train and I immediately felt like I found my home.\
  \ There is something magical about the dutch houses: some of them look like they\
  \ were built by elves and fairies, they're almost too perfect and dreamy to be real,\
  \ and some of them look like they were built as a set to a Tim Burton movie: with\
  \ their oblique walls leaning on each other as they are moments away from collapsing,\
  \ wearing every possible shades of brown and the hugest windows I've ever seen.\
  \ It's comforting and calming, even if you are marching amongst the other fifteen\
  \ thousand tourists who came to smoke weed and to look at the girls in the Red Light\
  \ District.\n  Amsterdam is much more than that, but to understand this, one needs\
  \ a stable home and  a local friend, who knows everything about the hidden secrets\
  \ of The Netherlands. I found my all-knowing friend in my landlord, at the first\
  \ house where we were living.  He was born in Amsterdam, he built his house with\
  \ his own hands and with his 83 years, he is the most curious, smart and talented\
  \ youngster that I've ever met. Living in his house, being his friend made me understand\
  \ how that city, that giant mass of people work. I could do whatever I wanted to\
  \ as long as I kept his basic rules and that's how dutch people operate. You have\
  \ the right to come, you have the right to stay and to be your true self ( because\
  \ nobody cares) as long as you are not hurting others and  keep the basic rules.\
  \ This regulated freedom is the secret of Amsterdam. This is why those colossal\
  \ windows are all without curtains: those who are living behind them are not hiding,\
  \ because those who are walking before them are not peeking inside. This never resting\
  \ anthill of people  is based on a set of well working ground rules. The dutch people\
  \ made their country available for everybody who's willing to cooperate with them.\n\
  \ Living with a dutch friend taught me that Holland is not only about wearing wood\
  \ shoes, eating cheese and watching tulip fields from a windmills window.  It's\
  \ about acceptance and tolerance, about being able to give and to make place in\
  \ your home to others, so they can feel at home too."
