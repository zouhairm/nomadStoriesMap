Text: "\u201CYou\u2019ll meet many big frogs if you walk that way off the path\u201D\
  \ \n\nIkan, our casual bellman told us, as he wove us across the stepping-stones\
  \ through an insect chorus jungle to our villa, his bare feet and traditional headdress\
  \ moving ahead into the darkness.\n\nThe people of Lombok are what make this rare\
  \ untouched island in the Indonesian archipelago feel like you\u2019ve stumbled\
  \ into an ancient lifetime. Ikan had that Eckhart Tolle in-the-moment presence,\
  \ I felt my shoulders drop from a brace I didn\u2019t even know I was carrying.\
  \ \n\n\u201CWe have guests from all over the world even some celebrities, who find\
  \ us on the web\u201D\n\nThe Internet opened Lombok up to tourism again after decades\
  \ of false starts, from a violent coup leading to ethnic cleansings, followed by\
  \ crop failings that led to widespread famine in 1965. \n\nAfter a short-lived boom\
  \ in the 80\u2019s, a wave of economic and political crisis put on hold Lombok\u2019\
  s potential to cultivate a tourism off the back of successful nearby Bali. In 2006\
  \ when Lombok invested in an international airport, the digital era drew a new level\
  \ of attention, and a slow increase of visitors started to trickle back in.  \n\n\
  \u201CStop - \u201D\n\nIkan waved us to a halt. \n\nLooking past his shadowed frame\
  \ I saw a shadow of what looked like one of the biggest frogs I had ever encountered.\
  \ It was right where Ikan\u2019s next step would be; he waited patiently a few moments\
  \ until it hopped away.\n\nIkan waved us forward again; turning to smile as though\
  \ we\u2019d shared a special moment, his warmth for his island infectious. I liked\
  \ him immediately, he had set the tone for our trip and I felt another layer of\
  \ my busy life fall away from my shoulders. \n\nStepping from the lift that was\
  \ suspended along the side of the jungle mountain, we entered our open-air villa\
  \ to the pounding sound of the Indian Ocean, and tears sprung up in my eyes. \n\n\
  I felt like I had escaped months of gruelling work, a painful break-up and just\
  \ now with the warmth of this island, Ikan grinning in his blue and opal toned headdress\
  \ while the ocean howling across the canopy of palm trees \u2013\n\nI was cracked\
  \ wide open, while standing bags in hand looking out over a palm tree jungle trailing\
  \ right up to Lombok Strait, with a strange sense that I had come \u2018home\u2019\
  . \n\nSuch is the power of stumbling across a remote resort online and being welcomed\
  \ warmly by strangers like I was family, and it was the last thing I had ever expected."
