Text: "The flat images of mountains glued to the pages of National Geographic magazines\
  \ would finally rise to life.  Just as I imagined. But nothing could prepare me\
  \ for what I was about to experience.  \n  \nThe sky was spewing out spirals of\
  \ snow, splattering the slopes in white.  \nThe frosty air thickened.  The lifts\
  \ were moving. The lines were shortening. The life was now. \n\nAs I stepped off\
  \ the ski-lift, I was greeted by a slap of chilly air- a rather enthusiastic welcoming,\
  \ that told me it was time to chuck on my glasses, mount the board, and head on\
  \ down the slopes. \n\nAt first it was just me and my board weaving in and out.\
  \ Kicking up shiny white dust. Decorating the snow in silver white ribbons. So sick.\
  \ \nThen-\nThe slopes steepened and widened in gradient. Faster and faster. \nWait.\
  \ What? I gulped. That's when I realised. \nI was on a Black Slope! Words exchanged\
  \ with Tyrolians earlier that day belted through my ears.   \n\"Vermeide die Schwarze\
  \ Abfahrt! Es eignet sich f\xFCr sehr gute Skifahrer!\" \nShit. \n\nIt was as if\
  \ a snow monster was pushing me forward. Closer and closer.  Choppy, wind arms \
  \ wrestled with my jacket. It almost had me now.  Its icy breath swam up my neck,\
  \ before I was swallowed by pure whiteness. I didn't know if I was in the sky or\
  \ on ground, if I was flying left, if I was flying right,  if jagged rocks or pointed\
  \ trees, sneakily disguised in white, awaited me.  All I knew was that I was being\
  \ gobbled up, sliding down the insides of the blizzard beast. There was no going\
  \ back now. The wind was hooting in glee. At this point, my board was entirely decked\
  \ in snow-all the way up to my knees. And the monster only continued to shove more\
  \ snow down its throat.  Then it hit me. My squashed tomato face suddenly exploded\
  \ with laughter. Although I'll never know what to expect, I may as well just relax,\
  \ settle down and let the slope take me on the next wild ride of my life."
