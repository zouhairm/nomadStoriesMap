Text: "I was twenty-six years old, newly separated from my husband and on a train\
  \ to Amboise. I had been unhappy but couldn\u2019t make sense of why I was leaving\
  \ him. I needed to get away and booked the trip on a whim. A chilling September\
  \ downpour and ferme signs greeted me.\n\nI waited for the Amboisians to savor their\
  \ lunch to the last morsel of Sainte Maure de Touraine, and rented a bike to visit\
  \ Chanonceau. Not too far into an unpaved Loire a Velo path, the road to cut through\
  \ the forest between Amboise and Chanonceau, I swerved and grazed my toes in the\
  \ mud when I spotted a bearded axe man. I looked straight ahead to not meet his\
  \ eyes, which I felt were trailing me as I rushed away. As the forest thinned, the\
  \ Chateau jumped out, first by the derriere draped across the Cher. I would not\
  \ have known this was the jewel of the Loire if not for the distinct architecture.\
  \ I circled the outdated mansion a few times, then Googled a restaurant nearby to\
  \ try to salvage the Chanonceau experience.\n\nThe meal lived up to my expectations:\
  \ escargot floating-congealed in foam-cream, mackerel to be discovered from a squash\
  \ puree, bed of fibrous pasta soaking in the juices from a fowl, capped with a glass\
  \ of Chignon. I shook hands with the waitress, the maitre\u2019d, and the chef,\
  \ and walked out into a pitch black night. The glow from the wine faded the instant\
  \ I stepped into the rain, and my hands shook as I undid the locks and calculated\
  \ the ride back. I remember pedaling for two hours, unable to see anything but my\
  \ front tire. My mouth dried up despite the rain and the sweat, and my mind\u2019\
  s eye projected the image of the axe man in dark corners. I tried not to slip or\
  \ stop. Back at the Airbnb, I squatted down in a warm shower and cried. I put my\
  \ life in danger on a whim and was lucky to be unscathed.\n\nMy husband used to\
  \ call me lucky. I married a man nine years older so that he could teach me not\
  \ to make mistakes. But once married, I felt the scope of my world diminish. My\
  \ life was safe but controllable, inorganic, sure. I no longer left alive. In that\
  \ shower, I realized I wasn\u2019t lucky; I was sustained by the whims I have and\
  \ the mistakes I make. \n\nTwo nights later, I ventured out to make another mistake,\
  \ riding headlong towards the axe man in the forest. I realized something important:\
  \ I needed to choose a partner I could make mistakes with, rather than in spite\
  \ of. The velvet night rushed into me with the full lush of the Loire Valley, this\
  \ time capped with a glass of Bourgeil."
