Text: "I awoke beaded in sweat, bamboo beams digging into my spine and the sound of\
  \ roosters waking up the village. It was my second day in rural Thailand. I rolled\
  \ myself out from under the mosquito net and breathed in the warm, sticky air. I\
  \ met with our Thai tour guide, Lay, who was taking us to his village. Down a dusty\
  \ hill sat a series of bamboo huts, home to his family. Their belongings were scarce,\
  \ only having the bare minimum get by. Sheets hung from the ceiling to separate\
  \ the space into rooms, and thin matrices sat in a corner. We followed Lay to where\
  \ an old woman was sitting on the veranda. Her skin was weathered from the harsh\
  \ sun and she was hunched over a pile of leaves. Spotting Lay, she broke into a\
  \ wide grin, displaying few blackened and decaying teeth. Her gums were stained\
  \ red but her eyes were sparkling. Lay introduced the woman as his mother. As they\
  \ spoke in Thai, I watched her work quickly, sorting through the pile of green leaves\
  \ as she wrapped them around an unrecognisable brown nut. Lay caught my curious\
  \ gaze, and explained that the small brown object was a betel nut, which is wrapped\
  \ in the leaf after a dusting of lime and tobacco, chewed for its stimulating effects.\
  \ Joining Lay\u2019s mother on the porch, he spoke about the cultural practice of\
  \ the betel nut and its important role in social customs, her hands never wavering\
  \ as she folded these little green parcels, lining them up neatly on the bamboo\
  \ floor. She then picked one up from the pile placed it in front of me. A little\
  \ green offering. I looked up at Lay, and then back to this little green pouch of\
  \ stimulant. My two friends grabbed theirs, and although unsure, I accepted the\
  \ offer from this beautiful Thai woman. It would be rude not to. On the count of\
  \ three, we all popped the green parcel in our mouth, and begun to chew to release\
  \ the stimulant inside. Immediately my mouth filled with saliva as a bitter taste\
  \ spread across my tongue. My lips were tingling and my cheeks were becoming numb.\
  \ Panicking, I shot a look up towards the boys who were uncontrollably drooling\
  \ red stained saliva and burst out laughing, realising my own mouth was the same\
  \ ruby red. The numb sensation had us all unable to keep our pooling saliva in our\
  \ mouths, and the floor began to become covered in red droplets as we laughed and\
  \ gagged on this foreign delicacy. Lay\u2019s mother sat there laughing with us,\
  \ over something so dear to her heart and so foreign to ours."
