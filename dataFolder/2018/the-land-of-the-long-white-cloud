Text: "Whakarewarewa Maori village is a land you might not know even existed. It's\
  \ almost hidden away from the modern world. One thing I noticed as we walked into\
  \ the village was the smell. In Rotorua, the geothermal smell across the town is\
  \ like eggs. People fanned themselves with their caps and a few people had sunblock\
  \ still sitting on their noses which hadn\u2019t been rubbed in properly. The tourist\
  \ guide welcomed the group of us and encouraged most of us who were European, to\
  \ pronounce \"Ki Ora\u201D which is used as a Maori greeting.\n\nWhile I crossed\
  \ over the bridge under the white archway there were children in the water below\
  \ diving for pennies. It\u2019s custom for them to ask tourists for a penny and\
  \ to find it underwater and grab it with their mouth. I threw a few coins in and\
  \ was impressed by how easily they found the coins in the brown murky water. Treading\
  \ along the pathway a building stood out which is one of the most common in New\
  \ Zealand. A Marae. It\u2019s like a beating heart for Maori people. It\u2019s a\
  \ sacred meeting house Maori elders, communities, and people gather for celebrations\
  \ and funerals. Each Marae can belong to a certain iwi, tribe, hapu, sub-tribe,\
  \ or whanau, family. \n\nThe Haka is one of the best things to see during a performance\
  \ of song and dance. It\u2019s a war cry and dance where stamping of the feet is\
  \ present. It gives me goosebumps whenever I see it. The males wear their piupiu\
  \ flax which is a skirt-like garment on stage. The strands sway when the performer\
  \ moves making a gentle rustling sound. The women wear a similar costume, but they\
  \ also have a pair, bodice, with intricate patterns in red white and black. The\
  \ next part of the performance sees the group throw them thin sticks to each other\
  \ in sync. \n\nA more complicated part is the poi, where the women swing balls attached\
  \ to chords. The coordination and balance are amazing it\u2019s mesmerizing to watch.\
  \ Another song is sung which is a flashback to Paraire Tomoana's 1912 courtship\
  \ of Kuini Raerena. The guitar and duet makes for a perfect setting. The show isn\u2019\
  t just to be watched though. The group on stage encourages everyone to stand up\
  \ so we can do the song, do the hokey pokey, but in Maori. I do my best not to trip\
  \ over!\n\nFrom my fun tour, I can see how Maori have made a huge impact in the\
  \ land of the long white cloud through spiritual beliefs, dance, and art, and by\
  \ connecting to Mother Earth. The village is an important celebration of the unique\
  \ Maori culture which is embraces across New Zealand."
