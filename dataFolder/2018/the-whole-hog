Text: "\u2018No, that\u2019s the lung.\u2019 \n\nHe was chastising me for confusing\
  \ my vital organs. Again. Thankfully I\u2019m not a doctor, but perhaps even the\
  \ most skilful surgeon would be confused to find so much offal floating in their\
  \ swine stew. I chewed on the gristly meat, the peppery tang of the city-state's\
  \ traditional pig organ soup in my mouth. \n\nIt was like a date with Hanibal Lecter.\
  \ All that was missing were the fava beans and Chianti in this crowded canteen nestled\
  \ in Singapore's Kampong Glam area. \n\nHe held another grey lump of the delicacy\
  \ delicately between his chopsticks. \n\n\u2018Then this must be the intestine?\u2019\
  \ I ventured. Sooner or later I must get it right in this strange porcine Russian\
  \ roulette we were playing. \n\nAt first it had come as a dare. His flinty dark\
  \ eyes challenged me. How far are you willing to go? Can you go native, beyond the\
  \ sanitised tourist bubble? Of course I took the bait - the heart, the liver and\
  \ the stomach too. But as he dissected every element of my soup I thought\u2026\
  \ maybe I don't want to impress this man so much!\n\nSpending a month travelling\
  \ through Indonesia with its harsh cultural views (a city mayor famously declared\
  \ instant noodles \u2018make babies gay\u2019) and even harsher laws against homosexuality,\
  \ I'd not dared so much as look at a guy. \n\nSo I was ready for a good old fashioned\
  \ date. I was imagining moonlight and music, love and romance. And that's how I\
  \ met Jaz and instead I got low plastic stools, cold yellow tiles and jostling for\
  \ elbow room at a jam-packed communal table. That'll teach me for using Tinder!\
  \ \n\nAs the meal progressed we dug into bean curd skins and pau, tasty pastry parcels\
  \ of lotus and chicken, getting to know each other. I was saddened that despite\
  \ Singapore\u2019s liberal laws and attitudes he felt that culturally he could not\
  \ be out to his family. They would not accept him. Instead he\u2019d developed a\
  \ rigorous work ethic and strove for career development, an acceptable substitute\
  \ for delaying the treadmill of marriage and babies. \n\nAlthough attracted to Westerners\
  \ Jaz did not understand the desire to travel beyond a two week holiday in the sun.\
  \ While I love trying something new, as my date had proved, Jaz did not. He had\
  \ no idea why anyone wanted to spend time in his city - a place I so enjoyed. While\
  \ I was grateful to him for an evening seeing his side of Singapore with a fellow\
  \ foodie, it was time to face the music\u2026 and go our separate ways. While I'd\
  \ hoped for a local connection, this time there was no connection at all."
