Text: "Life is a circle with Windows that you have to complete, it doesn't end but\
  \ starts whenever you desire and you get what you deserve. \nWaking up with the\
  \ same life routine has made me sick what no one can see though I was happy outside\
  \ to everyone like I used to be all the time because I have closed the window of\
  \ my dreams to let them come out. \nA simple guy with a different idea of living\
  \ the life, on my own terms without worrying about what the end would be because\
  \ at my place people used to make u a scarred person who have to live life according\
  \ to set standards of the society else pay the price. \nEveryone want me to not\
  \ to open the window which makes u not only feel alive but let breath. \nI wanted\
  \ to breath ..\nI had to open the window and I did 7 years back ..\nLeft everything\
  \ and came out of the negative shell that was tagged to me since birth ..\nThese\
  \ hills loves me the way I deserve, every unknown place knows me who I really am,\
  \ every bird calls my name, that wind on the top of hills hug me and fill my soul\
  \ .. that beach gives me the meaning of life that how deep it is and how calm and\
  \ twisted it is at same time ..\n\n\nYou have to open the window because u need\
  \ to breath to live, to love ..\nFind urself ..\nSearch ur soul \nIt's outside as\
  \ much it is inside you .."
