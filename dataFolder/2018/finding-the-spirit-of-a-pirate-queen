Text: "\u201CAre you a woofer?\u201D asked the tall man with thin, shoulder-length\
  \ hair tucked behind slightly pointy ears.\n\nI came to Clare Island for a restorative\
  \ interlude at an idyllic-sounding yoga retreat on an organic farm. As a solo woman\
  \ traveler, visiting the ancestral home of Ireland\u2019s pirate queen, Grace O\u2019\
  Malley, gave this excursion additional appeal.  \n\nIn between yoga sessions, I\
  \ stopped by the village\u2019s one-room heritage center, where I learned about\
  \ some well-preserved medieval wall paintings found in a 12th century stone church.\
  \ The Abbey, the docent informed me, was also the site of the O\u2019Malley family\
  \ tomb. I should find Bernie, she said, for the key to the church. \n\n\u201CA what?\u201D\
  \ I asked, squinting, wondering if I\u2019d just met a real live elf.\n\n\u201C\
  A woofer! Someone who helps out on farms!\u201D\n\nSeveral white sheep grazed in\
  \ the lush green pasture just beyond Bernie\u2019s whitewashed cottage. \n\n\u201C\
  Oh!\u201D A light went off in my head. \u201CNo, I\u2019m at the yoga retreat down\
  \ the road.\u201D\n\nBernie hosted volunteers through World Wide Opportunities on\
  \ Organic Farms, a service that facilitates homestays on organic farms. Their volunteers\
  \ are also known as \u201CWWOOFers.\u201D \n\nThe church was already open, Bernie\
  \ said, but I should come back with the key if I was the last one to leave. I joined\
  \ a small handful of visitors to admire the surprisingly vibrant frescos of men\
  \ on horseback, stags, and even dragons. \n\nAt the presumed resting place of the\
  \ pirate queen \u2013 a contemporary of England\u2019s Queen Elizabeth I \u2013\
  \ I reflected on the strength of Grace O\u2019Malley to rise to such prominence,\
  \ and how it would be considered unusual even today. \n\nWhen I returned with the\
  \ key, Bernie asked if I would stay for tea. His cottage was sparse but welcoming.\
  \ The packed dirt floor was swept clean, and a wooden ladder led the way to his\
  \ sleeping quarters in a loft above the kitchen. \n\nBernie prepared our tea with\
  \ care and attention. He unwrapped a dense molasses cake studded with dates that\
  \ his sister recently sent from Dublin. I was honored to be the first to share it\
  \ with him.\n\nWith his relatives now living on the mainland, the WWOOFers allowed\
  \ Bernie to continue running the family farm. He confessed that he thought the female\
  \ WWOOFers were the best. \u201CThey get things done!\u201D Just like Grace O\u2019\
  Malley, I thought, right next door.\n\nI didn\u2019t leave with a photo of Bernie,\
  \ per his request, but the spirit of Grace O\u2019Malley stuck with me for the rest\
  \ of my time in Ireland."
