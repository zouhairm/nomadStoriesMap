Text: "I am from Africa.\nApparently my ancestors took a really long round trip to\
  \ figure out that South Africa is the ideal place to live. Along the way we became\
  \ white skinned and returned on ships thousands of years later, surviving a deluge,\
  \ apparently, the Roman Empire, Christianity and the Renaissance.\nBut that\u2019\
  s ancient history. Speaking of which, we are on the brink of a breakthrough at the\
  \ Cradle of Humankind, as we speak. \n\nInspired by a documentary on ancient gold\
  \ mines and stone circles littering the landscape of South African, I recalled a\
  \ hike some years earlier in the hills of the Magaliesburg, where I\u2019d seeing\
  \ similar circles. \nI contacted the people who had been involved in arranging my\
  \ original trip years ago, but with little success. The tenant had moved on and\
  \ the new residents were indefinitely unavailable. I found only one other reference\
  \ on the net to these strange circles, in a small town paper from twenty years ago.\n\
  It mentioned the cable station as a reference\nMy Zulu friend, Sihle, gave me phrases\
  \ which he spoke into What\u2019s App voice note, a really helpful tip.\n\nAt the\
  \ cable station I explained to two locals what I was looking for and played them\
  \ the clips, which they found so impressive. My cell phone spoke Zulu. They pointed\
  \ us in the direction of a path which led only 1.5 km up a slight incline and slap\
  \ bang into a scene straight out of \"The Lost Ark\". \nA circle of stones twenty\
  \ paces across, a meter wide, standing as tall as a man, without an entrance. Conventional\
  \ archaeology suggests that these were cattle enclosures, but unless these ancient\
  \ fathers had leaping cattle, I doubt that.\n\nI spent an hour photographing and\
  \ documenting the stones. As we were turned to leave, I felt a strange presence.\
  \ A dark gloom descended over the place, already under a canopy of trees. I froze\
  \ and stared at the ground, sensing where the energy was coming from. Then it spoke.\
  \ \nAn old African man emerged from the trees. Only the whites of his eyes were\
  \ visible as he was hidden unintentionally in the shadows. \nWhat do you want? he\
  \ said in a deep drone.\nI want to know about these stones. \nNo you don't, he immediately\
  \ replied.\nWe have told the white men but they do not believe.\nWe say when the\
  \ stones sing they can fly. But they just laugh. \nNew finds suggest these circles\
  \ were part of some sort of power station for anti gravity.\n\nNow there may be\
  \ many mysteries out there, but non quiet as intriging as singing stones that fly,\
  \ right here on our doorstep."
