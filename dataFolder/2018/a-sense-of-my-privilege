Text: "\"Teacher come, please na.\"\n\nNikunj continued football practice and Hussain\
  \ stood behind me leaning against a wall. \"Go home Hussain, it's getting dark\"\
  , he said to him. Face dejected and shoulders drooping, Hussain had dragged his\
  \ feet out without saying a word. \n\nHigh-rise buildings juxtaposed against kilometers\
  \ of hovels - Mumbai was one of the poorest rich places in the country. This school\
  \ too was surrounded by a slum, and it was one of Asia's largest. Consistent Shia-Sunni\
  \ conflicts and the poverty had made it prone to ill-health, violence and abuse\
  \ of different kinds. The school principal had warned us too \"go home, before it\
  \ gets dark.\" \n\nHalf an hour had passed when we stepped out of the school gate\
  \ and found Hussain loitering. \"Teacher, my birthday, please come.\" \n\nThe dusty\
  \ paths were equally occupied by cattle and wooden carts with items on sale. The\
  \ interstices were a chaos of people. The air fluctuated between the smell of freshly\
  \ cooked meat, an open sewer, cow dung and once, of lemon. As I walked, I recalled\
  \ my birthdays - life had moved on from evening parties and neatly wrapped gifts\
  \ to growing up and receiving a 100 phone calls over office \"celebrations\".\n\n\
  It was a small room made of red bricks with splotches of cement. I took my sandals\
  \ out and placed them neatly on the side of the entrance before I pulled the curtains\
  \ aside to say Namaste  to Hussain's mother. \n\"His sisters are preparing a card\
  \ for him outside\", she said as she offered two glasses of water. \n\n15 minutes\
  \ later, she had burst into tears. The stress of the room's rent, future marriages\
  \ of three growing daughters and a husband who had left without warning had made\
  \ her tremble. Hussain was sitting on my lap as he stared at the flickering bulb\
  \ that hung like a pendulum in the middle of a room and listened to his mother weep.\
  \ I whispered to Hussain to distract him, \"If you could wish for anything in the\
  \ world today, what would it be?\"\n\nIn an instant his face lit up and he turned\
  \ towards me and said, \"Cake\".  Shocked, Nikunj and I soon left for the nearest\
  \ bakery. \n\nThe first cake in his life, was my first that mattered. While I did\
  \ not come from a background of affluence, his brimming face, despite his circumstances,\
  \ had suddenly made me aware of the privilege I had grown up in, and the gratitude\
  \ I never showed. That day, along with the cake, Hussain had unknowingly also cut\
  \ the sense of entitlement I had subconsciously carried around with me for 23 years."
