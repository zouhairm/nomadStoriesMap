Text: "The Balkans have such a way of making the seemingly simple become tremendously\
  \ tricky and the tremendously tricky turn out to be seamlessly simple. Such was\
  \ my trip north to Kosovo earlier this month. To travel into a country, which half\
  \ the world does not recognise, seemed quite a feet. Particularly so when my journey\
  \ would involve crossing another unfriendly frontier, between Greece, where I am\
  \ continuing my studies of the ancient world, and Macedonia. \n\n\u201CI would like\
  \ to inform you,\u201D I find this to be an omen, \u201Cthat due to a problem with\
  \ the license of the bus line Skopje routes may not be realized.\u201D Ah \u2013\
  \ the unfriendly frontier.\n\nThe situation presented seemed wonderfully Balkanic.\
  \ No matter, there was still the train \u2013 I like trains. Only of course this\
  \ train is actually a bus anyway, at least until the border with Macedonia where\
  \ you are left to stand on a desolate, yellowing concrete platform beneath an oversized\
  \ and modified star of Aigai while three rickety wagons are reluctantly shunted\
  \ out from the siding for you, left there until the bus arrives as if out of resentment\
  \ for you even making the journey. \n\nI know the train/bus well, but again even\
  \ this unusually integrated transport service has its quirks. Returning from a previous\
  \ trip I readied my luggage to exit the train at the border, to be told that it\
  \ was Sunday and so there was no driver for the bus. I was not abandoned to my fate\
  \ but rather the carriages continued on all the way \u2013 I was welcomed back into\
  \ Greece by the sight of a barbed wire compound menacing in on all sides. This Sunday\
  \ exception was in the Balkanic sense actually a convenience, if a painstakingly\
  \ slow one. Not being on a Sunday, the train was my last option.\n\nHowever fortune\
  \ favours the bold. I had the time to try my luck, and the good fortune that both\
  \ the bus and the train/bus departed from the train station in Thessaloniki. \n\n\
  \u201CIs the bus running?\u201D\n-\u201CDo you have reservation?\u201D\n\u201CNo.\u201D\
  \n-\u201CThen no.\u201D\n\nThere was a bus however, or rather a diminutive minivan,\
  \ surrounded by a gaggle of Kosovar passports all of whom had the good sense to\
  \ book a return trip, which the bus company honourably agreed to uphold. As I shrugged\
  \ my shoulders and blithely headed off to the ticket office, covering my ears in\
  \ case of a deafening \u201CBING BONG\u201D I heard a Slavic, \u201CSir! Sir!!\u201D\
  \ from behind me. It was the driver, who had sat entirely indifferent next to the\
  \ woman in the bus office. \u201C\u20AC20 and stay by me.\u201D I expect the fare\
  \ stayed with him too."
