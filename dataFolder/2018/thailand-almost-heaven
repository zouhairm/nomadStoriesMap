Text: "My singing is what you can call an acquired taste, and at the time I had never\
  \ really belted anything out before, but as the only native English speaker, I became\
  \ the default frontman for our motley crew.\n\nSix months prior I was singing quite\
  \ a different tune, however. Literally on the other side of the world, Thailand\
  \ took me by storm. I bought a one way ticket, I saw it as the beginning of an intrepid\
  \ new life, a respite from normalcy for however long necessary. But the foreign\
  \ sounds, exotic sights, and enrapturing smells proved too much for me, and I immediately\
  \ felt I had made a grave mistake. I looked for excuses to stay in my room convincing\
  \ myself I was still jet-lagged, I had a headache, or it was just too sunny.\n\n\
  But I had traveled to Thailand to teach students, and had signed a contract to do\
  \ so. I had to stick it out.\n\nAfter a few days of teaching, I soon found out that\
  \ my students and I had something in common, and mercifully it was something I was\
  \ quite good at. At that point I had been playing guitar for almost a decade, but\
  \ few people knew it. Never a musical showboat, I played nightly in my room, but\
  \ the years of solitary practice finally paid off.\n\nMy students would bring in\
  \ their guitars for music class, and one day I asked to see one. I started playing,\
  \ and other guitars came out as the requests poured in. We\u2019d stumble through\
  \ popular but obscure 70\u2019s, 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s favorites\u2014Hotel California\
  \ by The Eagles. Rock You Like a Hurricane by The Scorpions. Zombie by The Cranberries.\
  \ But the absolute favorite was Country Roads by John Denver.\n\nHailing from Virginia\
  \ myself, and not too far from the Mountain State, I quietly thought of Country\
  \ Roads as my way to indirectly introduce my students to a piece of my home as we\
  \ played in the hot Thai afternoons.\n\nI arrived in Thailand with no knowledge\
  \ of the language whatsoever. When I left, I understood that perfect pronunciation,\
  \ grammar, and vocabulary were far less important for communication than hand signals,\
  \ patience, and musical intent.\n\nAfter Thailand, I traveled to other countries\
  \ in the area, and one thing remained true\u2014John Denver reigned supreme. He\
  \ was played in the mountains of Banaue, Philippines, the beaches of Indonesia,\
  \ and the streets of Penang, Malaysia. The verses were muddled, often just hummed,\
  \ but the chorus was clear sung proudly by inebriated locals and travelers from\
  \ Germany, Australia, Poland, and England and, for at least one night, no matter\
  \ where in the world you were from West Virginia felt like home."
