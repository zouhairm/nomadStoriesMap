Text: "I wake to the chattering song of the tropical birds, the crowing of roosters,\
  \ the golden sunlight filtering through the tiny window of my temporary bedroom.\
  \ This is dawn in Bali, Indonesia. \n\nFor the past two weeks that I have been in\
  \ the town of Ubud, I have had the privilege of staying in a traditional Balinese\
  \ home. The compound consists of a large, lush courtyard that serves as a base to\
  \ several separate buildings \u2013 each room has its very own pavilion. Architecturally,\
  \ these homes are stunning and complex, but in every other aspect, the Balinese\
  \ seem to have a relatively basic way of living. The first thing I noticed when\
  \ I arrived in Bali was the simplistic lifestyle of the locals. The second thing\
  \ I noticed was how happy they are. \n\nI step out of my room to see Putu, my hostess\
  \ here in Ubud, sitting cross-legged on the tile floor of the pavilion opposite\
  \ to me. Each morning, she sits in this same spot, assembling little baskets out\
  \ of palm leaves and filling them with colorful flower petals. I have seen hundreds\
  \ of these vibrant baskets throughout my time here, burning outside of homes, their\
  \ petals scattered on the streets. \n\n\"Selamat pagi, Putu,\" I recently learned\
  \ how to say \"good morning\" in Balinese. \"What are you doing?\" I ask her, gesturing\
  \ to the small palm leaf in her hand. \n\nPutu looks up at me with that now familiar,\
  \ toothy smile of hers. \"Come, sit,\" she pats the white tile next to her, \"I\
  \ show you.\" \n\nI take a seat beside her and she hands me a leaf almost identical\
  \ to the one that she holds. She demonstrates precisely how to fold it and explains\
  \ to me that what she is crafting is an offering called Canang Sari, one of the\
  \ most important daily rituals in Balinese culture.  \n\nOnce I've managed to properly\
  \ form my palm leaf, Putu places an array of flower petals beside me and shows me\
  \ exactly where in the basket to place each of the different colored petals. The\
  \ four various colors, she informs me, represent the gods of the north, the east,\
  \ the south, and the west. \n\n\"We offer this every day,\" Putu tells me, \"to\
  \ say thank you to the gods for the good life.\"  \n\nI look up from what I am doing\
  \ and observe the simplicity of my surroundings, and then I look to my gracious\
  \ hostess. She has a light in her eyes. Here is a woman who has only what she needs\
  \ and nothing more. Here is a woman who dedicates time out of each and every day\
  \ to express gratitude for the life that she is living. Here is a woman who is truly\
  \ happy."
