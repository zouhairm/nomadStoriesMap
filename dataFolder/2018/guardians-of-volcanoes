Text: "Far away in the Ugandan Rift Valley, an undulating road guarded by towering\
  \ volcanoes took me to Lake Bunyonyi. While admiring the crystal clear waters, a\
  \ canoe commanded by a small captain approached. It was Charles, a 14 years old\
  \ boy that was making some cents to take back home. He offered me a ride in what\
  \ he called \"The Titanic\", and I could not refuse such a offer. \nHe was a smart\
  \ boy, he knew the name of each of 21 bird species we sighted, and talked about\
  \ politics and how important they were for his country\xB4s development.  But what\
  \ really called my attention was his knowledge about the Mountain Gorilas. He said\
  \ gorilas were guarding the forest and his family. \"I know this might sound confusing\"\
  , he said before I can expressed something; \"my mom works for the eco-lodge in\
  \ the mountain, while my sister sells souvenirs for the tourists\" he continued...\"\
  and here I am, making some dollars with you\". \"Don\xB4t you understand? tourist\
  \ come here for the Gorilas, not for us, they gave us jobs and in exchange we protect\
  \ them\". \nCharles explained me what any professor of nature conservation was able\
  \ to do. We arrived back to shore and I said goodbye to my young teacher. The next\
  \ day I started climbing up the undulating roads to the green mountains of tropical\
  \ forest in Bwindi. With my permit on hand, I built my tent and slept under the\
  \ light of the stars and the silence of the jungle, dreaming on what the following\
  \ day I was going to see. \nNot even the craziest dream or the best writer could\
  \ have described what I experienced the following day. Escorted by armed guards,\
  \ experienced park rangers and a new Irish friend, I started a 4 hour hiked through\
  \ the deep forest. Unexpectedly, the cracking of the shrubs betrayed the heroes\
  \ Charles was talking about. One female with a baby in his back was leading the\
  \ herd, another five were following her path, with a big silver back taking care\
  \ of them in the back. Silent and very carefully, we followed them through the steep\
  \ forest for half an hour; enough time to appreciate the beauty of this gigantic\
  \ creatures. Soon after the sighting ended, my travel companion slipped, calling\
  \ the attention of the gorilla family. The silver back, fulfilling his leader role,\
  \ sanded up in two legs and started to scream to remind us that we were just guests\
  \ in their home. I understood that both he and Charles, were no more than guardians\
  \ of the volcanoes; depending on each other."
