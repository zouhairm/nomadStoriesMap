Text: "I remember the first time she yelled at us, from the doorway of her shop. As\
  \ we finished our cheap, sweet cocktails at the wooden stall doubling as a bar,\
  \ we\u2019d somehow heard her over the street noise and the live band on the pavement.\
  \ To be fair, we reasoned, we said we wanted a proper Thai massage \u2013 not a\
  \ fancy spa massage from the 5-star hotel down the road, nice as it would be. We\
  \ wanted something authentic, something real.\nHer English wasn\u2019t great, yet\
  \ clearly miles better than our non-existent Thai. During our massage, the girls\
  \ laughed at him for being a 6\u20192 muscle-bound man who squealed in pain when\
  \ they jabbed their elbows in and dug their heels into his flesh as they pulled\
  \ on his limbs to stretch them. As we walked back down through the hot, loud streets\
  \ of Thailand, I wondered how it could be so oddly relaxing to have the busy cacophony\
  \ and hustle of people around you, milling around the stalls, in a way that wouldn\u2019\
  t calm you back home. Maybe it\u2019s being outside, or the exotic warmth in the\
  \ air, or the ease with which the vendors yell for you to come visit them, keen\
  \ to show you their goods. Maybe it\u2019s just Thailand.\nIn the end it was a daily\
  \ occurrence over the weeks we were there. Waving, shouting, smiling to each other.\
  \ \u201CRemember us? Hi!\u201D She was outside again that day, calling for customers.\
  \ When she saw us, she simply shouted \u201CCOME\u201D and waved us over impatiently,\
  \ like she\u2019d spotted her disobedient children in the crowd. She didn\u2019\
  t smile until we reached her door and her hands were placed firmly on our arms.\
  \ Then she was beaming, like she was proud we\u2019d returned to her, but not as\
  \ buyers this time.\nThis time we sat in the front lounge of the shop. She pushed\
  \ us into wicker chairs and thrust glasses into our hands, chattering to the others\
  \ in the shop in Thai. She poured strong, neat rum in to our glasses and the bottle\
  \ was passed round, our cheers spanning languages. Her firm, intimidating insistence\
  \ was just as paradoxically comforting as the sticky, noisy streets.\nThe men made\
  \ small talk about football (the universal tongue), the women gossiping and styling\
  \ each other\u2019s hair, all in a limited common language with us. The fact the\
  \ wicker chair was hard and vaguely uncomfortable didn\u2019t matter. I still only\
  \ knew how to say \u2018hello\u2019 and \u2018thank you\u2019 in Thai, and the strength\
  \ of the rum went to my head. But what most warmed me was how it felt to sit with\
  \ friends both old and new, in a community so foreign, and feel so welcome."
