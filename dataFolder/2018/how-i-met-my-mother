Text: "This one time (in the band camp \xA9) I went to Taiwan to celebrate it\u2019\
  s 100 Years Independence Anniversary. 3 planes, 25 hours \u2013 and I was in the\
  \ land of \"many bays\". I didn't sleep, was dead tired and my 'host mother' Grace,\
  \ the receiving party of the cultural exchange, wasn\u2019t at the arrivals. So\
  \ I took a bus. And a train. And yet had to wait for 2 hours. \n\nPicture me. Little\
  \ angry bird with a yellow braid sitting on the bench of a giant train station,\
  \ Taipei roaring around. I was snoozing when my absent-minded host came to my rescue.\
  \ Boy, did we not understand each other\u2019s English! Grace Lee made it worse\
  \ by her confident nods to all. \n\nI hit the bed at 2 am. It seemed like I\u2019\
  d just closed my eyes when Grace woke me up at 8. Taiwanese hospitality was dragging\
  \ me to plant trees with Peace Corps at the end of the world. Grace also dragged\
  \ her two incessantly nagging kids. \"Bummer\" I thought as volunteers\u2019 car\
  \ with me in it has hit the road. I was zombie awake when we made it to Kaohsiung.\
  \ The beauty of the sea, bathing the bay in the last reflections of a tender sunlight,\
  \ couldn't make up for 36 hours of no sleep. I didn't want beauty. I had to sleep\
  \ (and nag a little). But Grace was busy with real kids demanding attention. \"\
  I didn\u2019t volunteer for this!\" was my last thought as I drifted away around\
  \ midnight. \n\nThe alarm went off at 5. We had to drive and be out on the field\
  \ by 7. Rage was pumping in my temples. No power would smoke me out of the car.\
  \ Except for the whining kids. I stood in a field, deprived of sleep, eaten alive\
  \ by mosquitos under the scorching sun. And Grace understood. I caught her apologetic\
  \ glimpse, and the hot wave of shame made me blush. Something harmless about the\
  \ way her hair moved every time she nodded made inner frenzy give way to the embarrassment\
  \ no fatigue could silence. Kind beautiful pure soul, Grace involved me in off the\
  \ beaten path experience, and I lived it as torture. Tree planting was over. The\
  \ way back was awful. \n\nWhen exhausted kids went to bed, I invited my Grace for\
  \ a tea, confessed how I felt and how sorry I was. She said she felt a relief and\
  \ was sorry too. But she had nothing to be sorry for: her conscience was clean.\
  \ And mine was becoming cleaner too. We\u2019ve finally understood each other\u2019\
  s English. And Human. The rest of the trip we motorbiked in the swimming suits around\
  \ Kinmen Island and filmed the funniest video lessons 'Chinese with Grace Lee'.\
  \ Grace got drunk on 0,2L of beer. But this is a whole new story."
