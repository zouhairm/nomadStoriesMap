Text: "Lisa, a backpacker friend from Ireland is doing 150km/hr behind the wheel of\
  \ our hired Land Cruiser, and I'm starting to feel uneasy. We're on the mighty Gibb\
  \ River Road at the entrance to the Kimberley. \n   As the bitumen turns to gravel,\
  \ Lisa eases to a (still too fast for the conditions) 120km/h. Another car is approaching\
  \ and my grip tightens a little on the seat in front of me. Sure enough a small\
  \ stone is flicked onto our windscreen, leaving a small chip. Relieved, I mention\
  \ that it was a good last minute choice to opt for the comprehensive insurance.\n\
  \   As masses of dust billow out from behind us, Dan my fellow backseat passenger\
  \ undoes his seat belt to swivel around for a better view and at the same time,\
  \ I feel the car drift a little sideways. Instinctively I brace my hands against\
  \ the warm metal roof. \n   Then my side of the car lifts gracefully, as if gravity\
  \ has been turned off. We begin to roll. Over and over, for what feels like an eternity.\
  \ The windows explode and dust fills the car. Over and over we go. Then suddenly\
  \ we're stationary and all is silent bar the roar of the engine, still at full revs.\
  \ \n   \n   Fast forward five years and I'm on my way back to Broome, this time\
  \ as a guide, driving tour busses to Darwin via the Kimberley. Finally, I'll get\
  \ to see Mitchell Falls! At the very least, I'll be glad to get further than the\
  \ first 100km we travelled along this stretch of Gibb River Road the first time\
  \ round.\n   The first camp site to present itself is soon after you\u2019ve exceeded\
  \ driving the first hour of gravel and is called Windjana Gorge. With its majestic\
  \ 30 metre vertical cliff faces of ancient coral reef (now limestone), the gorge\
  \ is split by a calm river, filled with freshwater crocodiles and many species of\
  \ birds. \n   Over the next year, I am blessed to show travellers through this magical\
  \ land, at last achieving what only a few years prior I had seemed doomed not to.\
  \ Sitting on the plateau gazing across the water cascading down these famous falls,\
  \ my memory wanders back to a time when four backpackers made plans for a trip,\
  \ which had plans of its own for them. \n   Somehow that day we cheated death. None\
  \ of us were badly injured, but we learned some serious life lessons about four\
  \ wheel driving on outback roads. \n   Now whenever someone asks me tips on taking\
  \ a trip to the Kimberley, I always just say, \u201Cexpect the unexpected\u201D\
  \ and leave the rest to their imagination."
