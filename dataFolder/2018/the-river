Text: "One day I opened my eyes thinking in the rivers, because they are never the\
  \ same, then, Im a river, Im never say the same words, I forgot even my name when\
  \ the night is come ... So, that day, I took my bag pack again, and just walked\
  \ next to river, follow the sound of the heart, the soul, the life ...\n\nI went\
  \ to Cancun, where I found more than a beautiful landscape, because, I could watch\
  \ the dance of an Argentine gypsy, who could read my hands, I could watch a sorceress,\
  \ who sang an old song to alleviate my spirit, I met a thief taught me to steal\
  \ only the heart and the next morning a spain man told me that he was in love for\
  \ the first time ... And the river is not change, always just flowing.\n\nThis the\
  \ essence of the river, where belong the traveler, where the good and evil lost\
  \ the time, and then, I get my bag pack and still in Mexico, I went to Guadalajara,\
  \ where the rain is the church of the culture, where everybody believe that they\
  \ can change something, where the people cry while laugh to laughter and where the\
  \ music is the blanket that covers the cold.\n\nPraying to the god of rain, my river\
  \ overflowed for love and continue the road while the world sleep and dream with\
  \ the hope, and then I arrived to Canada, where the old legends received me, where\
  \ trees show me the away, and then I saw for the first time the snow, and feel for\
  \ the first time how the river stoped.\n\nThis is true, I learned more about Latin\
  \ America outside her and I put my eyes one the horizon where the dance is an idiom,\
  \ where the love is the most important, and living in Canada I met the love and\
  \ the same time I learned to say goodbye, as a river flowing for other place, for\
  \ other chance to change.\n\nThen, my flight went to 10 am, I gave my last kiss\
  \ as if it was the first and I left far away, and arrived to Puerto Vallarta, where\
  \ the river defrost for be alone, and  then start again.\n\nThe trip start as a\
  \ river and it ends at the sea, like an infinite ocean of possibilities, and that\
  \ is the essence of the tripper, that is the life of soul, flow over the time and\
  \ over the earth.\n\nSo, today I opened my eyes asking me where will go this river\
  \ now? So, I preparing my bag pack again, looking the horizon to find the new away,\
  \ the new story, the same love in other face, the legends, the sounds\u2026 the\
  \ river. \n\nAnd this is why I take the decision to never be the same, because the\
  \ world need change, need grow up to find humanity and share with others the possibility\
  \  of overflowing for life."
