Text: "The last thing I expected to do was fall in love in Amsterdam. But it happened,\
  \ and here is my account. The world and dating are a unique place. You can bump\
  \ into someone on Instagram and five months later be flying 4,355 miles over the\
  \ North Atlantic ocean to Holland. This worked out perfectly for the romantic and\
  \ the travel lover in me. It was my first time to Amsterdam and it would become\
  \ the backdrop for a pretty amazing Before Sunrise-esque first meeting. Everything\
  \ about Amsterdam was a perfect match for the *worlds longest first date. (It was\
  \ 7 days if you are wondering.) Take for instance the quirky leaning buildings;\
  \ I would later find out on a canal tour that Amsterdam is built on a series of\
  \ hundreds of wooden planks under the water. The leaning buildings to me represented\
  \ the quality of endurance, strength and uniqueness that is palpable in this city.\
  \ We would walk hand in hand from canal to canal exploring amazing places to eat,\
  \ the 'coffee shops', museums, and unexpected attractions. We even thought of writing\
  \ every single thing down so we could help others who wanted to navigate the city\
  \ in a similar fashion as ourselves which was laid back with an emphasis on spontaneity.\
  \ But instead we opted for breakfast in bed almost every day at the Pulitzer Amsterdam\
  \ where we made our home for the worlds longest first date. The Pulitzer represents\
  \ all the good things about Amsterdam; history, design, function, and beauty. Our\
  \ *Captain on the canal tour guide (we nicknamed him the happiest man in the 'dam)\
  \ also hipped us to some history about the Pulitzer, and how it used to be a series\
  \ of apartments that were renovated into a hotel years later. Amsterdam was becoming\
  \ the perfect city to fall in love with a beautiful Swiss man! Coffee at Lot Sixty\
  \ One. Vegan eats at Juice by Nature. Museum hand holding at Moco. First kiss at\
  \ The Grand hotel. Frites at any street vendor, be sure to ask for the curry sauce.\
  \ Drinks on the rooftop of Blue Amsterdam. Bike Riding rentals on every street.\
  \ Indian feast courtesy of Koh-I-Noor, I still think about the Bhindi Masala, often!\
  \ Elevate your mood at Tweede Kamer 'coffee shop'. Traditional Dutch market called\
  \ Westerstraat. Take in a movie at Path\xE9 City. We walked all over the city holding\
  \ hands, talking, and sometimes dreaming of what it would be like to have an apartment\
  \ in Amsterdam. The last thing I expected was to fall in love with a city, and a\
  \ person."
