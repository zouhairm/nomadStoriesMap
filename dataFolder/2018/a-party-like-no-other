Text: "\u201CSo, it\u2019s a party on the beach?\u201D I asked.\n\u201CYup and we\u2019\
  re all going. It\u2019s a 3-day trip and you should come with!\u201D she said, with\
  \ a glint in her eye.  \n\"I think I can swing it. What is it called again?\u201D\
  .\n\u201CThe Full Moon Party.\u201D, was her reply, with that oh so sweet smile\
  \ of hers. \nAnd so, began a 3-day journey into an alcohol-infused frenzy, on a\
  \ beach with thousands of revelers dancing to the light of the October moon. After\
  \ a grueling 10-hour over-night bus ride, followed by an even more arduous 4-hour\
  \ ferry in the midday sun, we arrived on Koh Phangan, sun-burnt, slightly hung-over\
  \ and exhausted, yet excited for what we expected to be the party of the year. Conventional\
  \ wisdom would have dictated that we book out hotels well in advance, but being\
  \ the adventurous lot that we were, we decided to wing it. Which proved frustratingly\
  \ difficult when you\u2019re a group of 20. With our belongings safely stashed in\
  \ our rooms and our weariness of the day\u2019s events behind us, we hit the beach\
  \ rejuvenated by the anticipation of what was to come. The disappearance of the\
  \ sun\u2019s rays marked the transformation of Haad Rin beach from a relatively\
  \ peaceful stretch of sand into Party Central. The shore was lined with make-shift\
  \ bars selling liter-sized buckets of beer and cocktails, blaring party song after\
  \ party song. We began with a round of shots before partaking in a crazy crowd jump\
  \ rope activity, with said skipping rope set ablaze. In hindsight, not our smartest\
  \ decision. Luckily, we all escaped with only a couple of hairs singed. With buckets\
  \ in hand, music coursing through every fiber of our being and the moon\u2019s light\
  \ shining down on us, we danced, our limbs alive with a life of their own, separated\
  \ but one with the masses. That night, we talked, we laughed, shared drinks, exchanged\
  \ hugs and traded kisses with not strangers, but people intoxicated in the same\
  \ primal euphoria surging through each one of us; a celebration of life and youth.\
  \ I spot her, sipping on her bucket, slowly making her away across the shore, swaying\
  \ to the rhythm of the beat. She\u2019s close enough now that I see the tiny freckles\
  \ lining the edges of her cheek. She steps closer and rubs the tip of her nose against\
  \ mine, an Eskimoo kiss.\n\u201CIsn\u2019t this amazing!\u201D she says. \n\u201C\
  This is ridiculous! I can\u2019t believe we\u2019re at the full moon party!\u201D\
  \ I pipe back. \nShe chuckles before leaning into my ear to gleefully pronounce,\
  \ \u201CAsad, this is the pre-Full Moon Party. The Full Moon Party is tomorrow!\u201D\
