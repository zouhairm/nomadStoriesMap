Text: "I was always fascinated towards oceans because of its vast and wide spread\
  \ blue sheet across the globe, and the mysteries in it. \n\nThis time it was a small\
  \ town called Gokarna, which is situated in the southern coast of India. \n\nIt\
  \ was a twelve hours journey from Bangalore. I took a public bus to Gokarna. There\
  \ was a sense of adventure, which I could feel as soon as I boarded the bus. I started\
  \ having conversation with the co-passengers. There were mainly labourers, who would\
  \ come to the city to earn livelihood and then return to their home. I could see\
  \ a spark in their eyes, and a satisfying smile which is now a days hard to find\
  \ in the corporate world.\nI finally reached Gokarna, a small town but very beautiful\
  \ indeed. I could smell a town with rich cultural heritage in it. The locals gave\
  \ me a brief idea about the town, which even Internet failed to answer.\n\nFinally,\
  \ it was time when I would be confronting the mighty Arabian Sea.  As I was approaching,\
  \ I could hear the waves stomping the ground, along with my heart. The view was\
  \ quite soothing. I sat there and gazed for some time as the \u201Cgravity\u201D\
  \ played its part and waves would come and wash away the shore.\n\nAfter some time,\
  \ I started exploring the shacks on the beach. Eventually I settled down for \u201C\
  Namastey\u201D Caf\xE9. The most interesting thing was the shack has paid a tribute\
  \ to all the great singers who have touched our lives; it was surely the last thing\
  \ I expected there.\nThat evening I sat down in solace with a drink in my hand and\
  \ Dylan\u2019s \u201CBlowin in the Wind\u201D playing, and watching the sea dancing\
  \ on its own beat. That is how the night unfolded taking me with it.\n\nNext day\
  \ was a big day, as I planned to explore the beaches. I got into a boat, along with\
  \ few other tourist. I quickly be-friended them. We visited few beautiful beaches.\n\
  \nWhile our way back, the sailor took us to a spot and told us, if we were lucky,\
  \ we could see \u201CDolphins\u201D swimming around. I was astonished, as I did\
  \ not expected. I have never seen one in my life. The trip was unfolding its cards,\
  \ and each time it was great. We waited for quite some time. The sailor noticed\
  \ the disappointment in our eyes. He asked us if we want to jump in the mid ocean.\
  \ I guess he was trying to cheer us up, as we lost hope.\nI quickly took the opportunity;\
  \ it was indeed a moment. I closed my eyes, and suddenly someone shouted, I saw\
  \ Dolphins swimming around us. It was so beautiful. Gokarna opened its final trump\
  \ card, which was unexpectedly beautiful,"
