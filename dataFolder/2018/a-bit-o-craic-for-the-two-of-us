Text: "\u201CWe\u2019re going up there,\u201D chirps a voice similar to that of a\
  \ young king commandeering his subjects of the playground.\n\n\u201CTo where?\u201D\
  \n\n\u201CThat radio-tower.\u201D\n\nHe turns the wheel and we let the passage of\
  \ time slip by to ensure our safe arrival up this perfectly imperfect Irish valley\
  \ road. Along the way, the fence posts falter and spring upright again everytime\
  \ we dip or wind around yet another indifferent sheep that has claimed this particular\
  \ part of the dirtpath.\n\nWe had started our trip in the brimming hours that morning-\
  \ me, ladened with an oversized wool sweater to combat wild atlantic coast winds\
  \ (it took only a week to conform to the uncertainty and fickleness of Irish weather.)\
  \ In comparison, my tour guide for the day sported a faded blue t-shirt and the\
  \ iconic article of clothing for retired men: khaki shorts. We set off in his \u201C\
  faithful little pony,\" a classic silver Toyota adorned with white racing stripes-\
  \ custom added by his \u201Cscraping both sides along the rock walls of Connemara!\u201D\
  \ We weasled ourselves along the Lower Sky Road in this chariot before initiating\
  \ our current ascent.\n\nThe hills and unrelentless army of downy birch on this\
  \ remote trail have been ravaged by the morning stroll of a giant. I am not used\
  \ to this constant sway and bob, to tumultuous slopes that could be so unforgiving\
  \ if we inch the tire even a slight pebble stone to the left.\n\nBut his experience\
  \ is evident- this prior second-grade teacher from Alaska. Unlike me, he knows when\
  \ to hug the road a bit tighter, to speed up or lull into a babycrawl. I am an utter\
  \ virgin in this regard, sharing none of his familiarity in loving these roads nor\
  \ the blessed wisdom that he babbles out between concentrated silent stretches.\n\
  \nWe arrived by levying into a groove the earth had conveniently fashioned for this\
  \ grey stallion. With his ill back, Rob manages to stagger over to the splintering\
  \ post that juts against a highnoon sky of county Galway. Enrapturing sunbeams flood\
  \ the sky, drench the clouds and trickle down to emerald quilt-patch grazing fields.\
  \ I find that I cannot refuse my eyes from being lured in by the churning labyrinth\
  \ of small town roads and streams that jeer from below.\n\nEngulfed by voracious\
  \ waves of light and scenery, I manage to rip away for a second and look over to\
  \ my old friend; his eyes are wet with Irish pride.\n\nWe stood there, a number\
  \ of years between a backpacker and an unconventional local to the west Connemara\
  \ scene; two travellers simply appreciating the view."
