Text: "The scream shook my partner and I out of our easy conversation on the beach.\
  \ It was a desperate cry from a cornered animal. The man who had uttered it was\
  \ in the ocean, holding a boy, limp and unconscious, face down. He barely held it,\
  \ nearly torn from him by full fury of the ocean. The tide was far too strong for\
  \ most of the beachgoers to enter, the full moon had brought the waves to dangerous\
  \ levels. We looked at each other, both unsure of what was happening. We heard it\
  \ again and others began standing up from their towels to get a closer look, some\
  \ beginning to run. Someone was drowning. What do we do? \nI was running and decided\
  \ to save the boy. Real matter of fact, as if I was already hugging him after CPR,\
  \ posing for the local paper. I\xB4m not a strong swimmer, I fled the too violent\
  \ water yesterday. Now, I was sure I could keep my head above water, reach and drag\
  \ the boy back to shore with the screaming man. I was delusional and self-seeking.\
  \ To impress my partner, I decided I would be a hero. I even imagined how cool I\
  \ looked as I ran into the water. But immediately, the waves tried to topple me\
  \ like an empty bowling pin. I turned my head and saw Una on the shore, her mouth\
  \ moving, but I couldn't hear a word. The waves dominated the space between my ears.\
  \ My world become a sequence of actions: keep your head up, scan for the boy, when\
  \ a wave comes take a big breath, quickly, duck into the water when the it hits,\
  \ hold your breath, keep your eyes closed, and come up when you\u2019re safe. Diving\
  \ under each wave felt like being pushed in one fluid motion by a thousand separate\
  \ hands to the bottom of the ocean. My lungs wheezed with effort, straining against\
  \ my ribcage as I shot to the surface after each wave. I couldn't see a body or\
  \ the man anywhere. Each wave created terribly high brown walls that would crash\
  \ so swiftly around me. I felt like the Egyptians chasing Moses in the Red Sea,\
  \ trapped in a valley of collapsing mountains. One out of sync wave followed viciously\
  \ close behind the other, allowing me one choked breath before diving. \nUnder that\
  \ errant wave, I was almost in outer space, everything muffled and muted. I couldn't\
  \ breathe, open my eyes, and I had the first rational thought since I\xB4d heard\
  \ the scream. If I stay in this ocean any longer, I\xB4ll die. The boy was dead,\
  \ maybe the man too. I had to live. I wasn't willing to risk my life for a body.\
  \ I was leaving it in the ocean. I wasn\xB4t a hero. I began swimming back to shore."
