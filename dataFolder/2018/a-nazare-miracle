Text: "I gasped for breath on the edge of a cliff, fierce gusts of wind catapulting\
  \ stinging bullets of rain into my face. I staggered sideways drunkenly, blown off-course\
  \ by the gale. \n\nAnxiety crept tingling over me as I fought to make headway. The\
  \ sensation of physical helplessness amidst the tempest was terrifying, and I pled\
  \ silently that Mother Nature would not send me plummeting to my death \u2013 it\
  \ was a long way down to the crashing surf below.\n\nMaybe it was a fitting situation.\
  \ \n\nThe Legend of Nazar\xE9 has it that Dom Fuas Roupinho was hunting on horseback\
  \ when he found himself speedily approaching the edge of a cliff. Dom lofted heavenwards\
  \ a desperate prayer: Our Lady, Help Me. His steed miraculously came to a teetering\
  \ stop at the precipice's brink, and the site became a place of pilgrimage and veneration.\
  \ \n\nNazar\xE9 beckoned me for other reasons \u2013 its repute as a quaint beach\
  \ town with azure waters rimmed with golden beaches. But as I awoke with heavy rain\
  \ drumming on the roof, I resigned myself to a soggy day of exploration. \n\nA steep\
  \ succession of staircases carved a path up the cliffs to where the Sitio neighborhood\
  \ balanced precariously. Balconies of undercut rock jutted out daringly over the\
  \ striated rock face, fallen boulders piled ominously below.\n\nUpwards I climbed,\
  \ bound for North Beach. I hoped that the stormy weather would produce the enormous\
  \ waves that gained Nazar\xE9 its fame \u2013 home to the world's largest wave ever\
  \ surfed. \n\nThe desolate shore stretched beneath the cliffs in an empty crescent,\
  \ and I walked the winding road along the cliff's edge. The weather was worsening,\
  \ but there were no giant waves nor foolhardy surfers to be seen, and I decided\
  \ to turn around \u2013 into the arms of the storm. \n\nAs I flailed like a rag\
  \ doll, flung around at the mercy of the winds, a tiny car beeped and pulled over.\
  \ \n\nMy miraculous steed! \n\nI wobbled over to it as quickly as I could, yanked\
  \ open the door and collapsed into the passenger seat.\n\nObrigada, obrigada, I\
  \ exclaimed profusely. Thank you.\n\nI tried to apologize for getting his car wet,\
  \ but he waved it off and smiled.\n\nWe didn't speak much of each other's languages,\
  \ but we didn't need to. I'm sure the gratitude showed in my eyes as we descended\
  \ back into town.\nIt's funny how little needs to be said in order to make such\
  \ a deep impact in a stranger's life. \n\nI don't recall if we even exchanged our\
  \ names, but I will remember that man for life as my Nazar\xE9 miracle, the rescuer\
  \ who plucked me from the storm."
