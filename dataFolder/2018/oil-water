Text: "Numbers don\u2019t lie, my calculus teacher loved to say.\n\nThe Amazon: pristine,\
  \ untouched, ancient beauty. Or at least that\u2019s what I\u2019m expecting as\
  \ I stuff my new pants into my backpack, getting ready for my trip.\n\nStop #1 is\
  \ Tiputini, the most pristine biological field station in the Ecuadorian Amazon.\
  \ It is every National Geographic photo you ever saw of the Amazon. I expected this.\n\
  \nStop #2 is Lago Agrio. Ram\xF3n, the Indigenous Ecuadorian guiding us through\
  \ his Amazonian backyard, asks, \u201CCan you count on your hands the number of\
  \ people you know who have died of cancer?\u201D Silence as we each raise a single\
  \ hand, various digits extended. \u201CI\u2019ve known over three hundred,\u201D\
  \ he says. More silence. It seems an impossible number. I didn\u2019t expect this.\n\
  \nHe leads us into the forest, to a well, built generations ago. He steps onto a\
  \ piece of wood, which I assume has been placed there for this purpose, and lowers\
  \ a long stick into the well. He brings it back up; oil covers over two feet of\
  \ the stick. Using protective gloves, he reaches down and scoops up a glob of oil.\
  \ He points his fingers downwards, and the oil reluctantly fall back into its two-foot\
  \ deep home (oil gives little resistance to being picked up, it turns out; the resistance\
  \ doesn\u2019t come until you want to get rid of it). \u201CWho wants to try?\u201D\
  \ he asks.\n\nWhen it\u2019s my turn, oil splashes on my new pants, which cost 40\
  \ U.S. dollars I didn\u2019t really have and which I only bought because my friend\u2019\
  s host mom\u2019s sister\u2019s husband handmade them and he\u2019d insisted they\
  \ were a necessity for anyone visiting the Amazon. \u201CThe oil ruined my pants!\u201D\
  \ I say, to which Ram\xF3n responds, \u201CSt. Clair, the oil ruined the Amazon.\u201D\
  \ It feels like wet tar. I feel fouled in some ancient way, and as soon as I step\
  \ back off the wooden beam, I rip off the glove and throw it in the tour guide\u2019\
  s trash bag.\n\n\u201CTodo esto era agua,\u201D he says. \u201CThis was once water.\u201D\
  \ He tells us that when oil was extracted from the land, over a hundred oil spills\
  \ were left behind. Over a hundred. Another impossible figure. Now, three hundred\
  \ no longer seems like an impossible figure. All the Indigenous tribes had left\
  \ that area after decades of disease and illness, and the plants had long since\
  \ failed to flourish, and the few animals that remained had nothing to drink but\
  \ literal death. Here is Tiputini, and here is Lago Agrio, and here is Ram\xF3n,\
  \ watching his people die in a war for oil and profits. \n\nProfits are the bottom\
  \ line. I should have expected this, but I didn\u2019t."
