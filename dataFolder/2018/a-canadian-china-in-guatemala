Text: "\u201CKarl, watch, it\u2019s like I\u2019m a queen,\u201D I say as we walk\
  \ side by side along a path towards our hiking destination. We are walking past\
  \ a long line of men who are working on what reminded me of workers working on the\
  \ Canadian Pacific Railway as I learned as a child in school. At every sound of\
  \  \u201C!China!\u201D Karl gets a little excited. \u201C!Hola! [hello] !Bueno dias!\
  \ [good morning],\u201D I respond to each sound of \u201CChina\u201D and every one\
  \ of their smiles with a wave and a smile of my own. Appreciating the attention,\
  \ but at the same time feeling nervous and wanting the line to end, I continued\
  \ with Karl on our way to our hike in the highlands of Guatemala in Central America.\n\
  The men were lovely. The workers ranged from kids to older men, big and small, very\
  \ dark coloured skin, and they all wore clothing that were brownish in colour, covered\
  \ with mud stains, just like the mud stains on the black yoga pants that I was wearing\
  \ at that time. This is just one of the many experiences I had during my three-week\
  \ stay in the small town of Nebaj in Guatemala. Nebaj is situated up a mountain\
  \ hours and hours away from Guatemala City \u2014 the country\u2019s capital \u2014\
  \ and Antigua, the popular destination of tourists to Guatemala. \n\u201CChina,\u201D\
  \ is what the local people of Nebaj call me. \u201CChina\u201D is an endearing term,\
  \ a sort of  \u201Cproper noun,\u201D or generic name, for people who look Asian.\
  \ The small eyes is the facial feature that Guatemalans find so adorable. Coming\
  \ from Canada, a country known to be rather \u201Cpolitically correct,\u201D my\
  \ friends asked me if I felt offended by these interactions. My answer was, and\
  \ always will be, \u201Cno.\u201D When asked by my university classmates about how\
  \ I felt about being sponsored by donors to visit Guatemala, my answer was, and\
  \ always will be, \u201CIt is my fortune to get to be the one travelling, but I\
  \ am also proud of myself for having made myself available for the locals to get\
  \ to know without them having to travel far.\u201D"
