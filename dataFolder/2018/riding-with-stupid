Text: "Yoke north Australia\u2019s summer temperatures of 40-plus-degrees Celsius\
  \ with its debilitating humidity and you\u2019ve got the two best reasons to do\
  \ nothing strenuous. So why I decided to ride my bicycle 330 kilometres from Digger\u2019\
  s Rest Station to Purnululu National Park, and 330 back, is all conjecture.\n\n\
  But I do know why I started cycling around Australia in the first place - to travel\
  \ slow and simplify my life. The previous 5,000-kilometres had done just that, but\
  \ in fairy tale weather. \n\nLeaving Digger\u2019s Rest Station at the top of Western\
  \ Australia, I peddled into a wind so hot it was like riding into fire. I could\
  \ feel it peeling the skin off my face. Sweat drip-fed into my eyes, it plastered\
  \ my red long-sleeve shirt to my torso. Within an hour, I marvelled at my stupidity.\n\
  \nI drank like a thirsty fish while peddling down a highway that dissolved into\
  \ a watery mirage. Six hours and 90 kilometres later, I collapsed on what felt like\
  \ the most comfortable air mattress on the planet. \n\nI ate my heated dinner rations\
  \ of 250-grams of rice and tin of sardines from a dented billy. Lying in my mossie\
  \ proof tent, the desert smelled old, like the dust of the bones of creation. I\
  \ listened to howling dingos, the soprano chimes of butcher birds, and smiled myself\
  \ to sleep.\n\nMy fourth day revealed the ultimate challenge of not just this sojourn,\
  \ but my entire Australian rideabout; 46-degrees Celsius, infinite humidity, along\
  \ a 65-kilometre four-wheel-drive track made of chain-eating sand, rim-cracking\
  \ rocks, butt-jarring corrugations, and muddy water crossings. It felt like riding\
  \ over a serrated baking tray.\n\nIt was the only time I ever envied those travelling\
  \ on comfy seats in air-conditioned vehicles, music playing, cold drinks at hand.\
  \ \n\nSo the air-conditioned Purnululu Visitor Centre, at the 51-kilometre mark,\
  \ became an obsession. I prayed to see a building as I summited every hill, rounded\
  \ every corner. Eventually, I wobbled up its wooden steps. Josie the  receptionist\
  \ smiled and said, \u201CYou look a bit hot, mate.\u201D\n\nThe outback\u2019s midday\
  \ glare succumbed to the evening\u2019s pastel greens and browns as I arrived, relieved\
  \ that body and bike were intact, at the Walardi Campsite. I\u2019d cycled the 65\
  \ kilometres in eight and a half months. Whoops, I mean hours.\n\nI would go on\
  \ to ride another 7,000 outback kilometres but, profiting from hindsight, I tackled\
  \ the return 65-kilometre journey over two days. And I never rode with stupid again.\n\
  \nTHE END"
