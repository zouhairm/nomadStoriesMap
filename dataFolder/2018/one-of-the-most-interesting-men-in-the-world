Text: "The most magnificent leg of my drive in Alaska (and one that everyone should\
  \ do in their lifetime) is between Delta Junction and Paxson. The scenery just takes\
  \ your breath away! I stop to take pictures and just admire the beauty numerous\
  \ times. The pipeline runs parallel to the Richardson Highway for its entire length\
  \ but somehow does not defile the view.\nThe only reasonably priced lodging in Copper\
  \ Center is called \u201CUncle Nikolai\u2019s Cabin.\u201D I must inquire at the\
  \ bar (uh oh) for a room which is actually a little rustic cabin with shared facilities\
  \ across the parking lot. I must have this unbelievably leery look on my face because\
  \ the bartender, Ron, hands me the keys to inspect. The cabin is tiny but clean,\
  \ neat and cheap. He instructs me how to use the heater (\u201Cturn it on then run\
  \ like hell!\u201D) and hopes that I will return for a pint.\nRonald Simpson is\
  \ owner of the entire compound and quite an accomplished man. He is Athabascan and\
  \ a distant relative of the great Taral Tyone, a prospecting guide and first tribal\
  \ council chief, renamed Nikolai by Russian Orthodox missionaries. Ron researched,\
  \ wrote and published an 800 page tome about Nikolai called \"Legacy of the Chief\"\
  \ that you can purchase in the bar/bookstore/motel. Ron has followed in Nikolai\u2019\
  s footsteps and is a member of the tribal council. He is also an expert HO scale\
  \ modeler and runs his collection of trains through a replica he built of McCarthy\
  \ & Kennecott. The model is so large that he constructed an entire building to house\
  \ it. Ron will run the trains and give a tour of the building for a modest fee when\
  \ he is not tending bar. I am allowed to take a peek inside the complex for free\
  \ but the trains remain stationary.\nThe bar patrons are mostly unbelievably friendly\
  \ and/or inebriated local Athabascan men who buy me beer after beer, asking me to\
  \ regale them with stories of life in NYC; the shot glasses on the counter represent\
  \ drinks they have bought for me. I\u2019ve had four pints before I know it! Not\
  \ a great idea for a girl whose cabin bathroom is across the street. Ron knows the\
  \ waitress from the Tangle Lakes bar on the Denali Highway who dissed me and every\
  \ other \u201Cslick, big-city girl\u201D. He\u2019s finds the story hysterical and\
  \ assuages me. Time flies just chatting with everyone until it is time to close\
  \ the bar. A gentleman walks me to my cabin holding a flashlight to light the way\
  \ and make sure I arrive safely (did you say bear?!) BTW - The space heater did\
  \ not explode; the room is nice & toasty."
