Text: "Last year I co-led a group of college students on a week-long trip to the Dominican\
  \ Republic and Haiti to learn about border relations. We decided to take the second\
  \ half of the final day to ourselves.\nOur group stopped at a small beach where\
  \ we were allowed to spend a few hours abiding by our hearts desires, and I spent\
  \ mine with a friend I\u2019d made on the trip named Anton. We talked and combed\
  \ the beach for rocks to skim across the ocean surface. While searching vigilantly\
  \ and discussing family life, aspirations, and how this trip emotionally affected\
  \ us, I brought up how it would be so neat to be on a beach where every rock was\
  \ a skimming rock, perfectly circular and flat. I vocally wondered if a beach like\
  \ that existed anywhere in the world and how I\u2019d love to see it. Part of me\
  \ felt like only in a dream could I find that. Anton mused that standing on such\
  \ a beach would make searching far simpler.\nOur conversation continued into how\
  \ traveling has the power to bring people extremely close, even to make lifelong\
  \ friends, because a love for travel is a personality trait that can often define\
  \ people. Finding a connection in it can also define a relationship, and regardless\
  \ of where the lives of two travelers take them, they can always reconnect on firm\
  \ foothold of travel. My friendship with Anton had been sealed in my mind as such.\n\
  This conversation was interrupted to move onto our next stop, Morro, a cliff that\
  \ led into another beach. When we arrived I was surprised to see it looked so much\
  \ like the Cliffs of Moher, only from the waters perspective.\nThe sun was on its\
  \ way down, casting one of those brilliant orange glows across the water. I can\
  \ still picture it perfectly. Our whole group began walking along the long stretch\
  \ of beach, the end visible yet far enough away to take a while to reach. I remember\
  \ this as one of the most relaxing settings and beautiful endings to an educational\
  \ journey.\nWhile walking I looked further to the right along the upper edge of\
  \ the beach and stopped. I was absolutely blown away by what I saw. Stretching all\
  \ the way until the water met the cliff were tens of thousands of perfectly shaped,\
  \ flat, skimming rocks. They varied in size and while some were difficult to grasp,\
  \ most fit into my hand comfortably.\nI laughed at the incredible coincidence, having\
  \ never before that day desired to find such a beach, nor seen one. That moment\
  \ perfectly reflects my love for travel, new experiences, and for noticing simple\
  \ wonders."
