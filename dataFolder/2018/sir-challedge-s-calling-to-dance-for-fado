Text: "Travelling means a lot of things. It can be considered as passion, moreover\
  \ addiction. It can be a source of energies, or contrarily a way exhaust them. It\
  \ can be the willing to prove or knowledge or to get new ones. It can be a cause,\
  \ or rather a goal. It can be hard works or carefree holiday. It might mean the\
  \ paradise, but maybe the seventh depth of the hell.\nWhichever sunglasses we put\
  \ on to understand this mysterious desire, we will end up anyway at a single certain\
  \ conclusion. Travelling is a magic driven by a little devil in the bottom of our\
  \ hungry stomach, which is called Sir ChallEdge. It is good to know that Challedge\
  \ is the big brother of Challenge. Attention inspiration eagers, impulsion seekers,\
  \ notorious globetrotters: you cannot avoid to get to know the mesmerizing character\
  \ of Sir ChallEdge. Let me lead you to scene of our last encounter\nIt was such\
  \ a long time ago when we have seen each other - this lovely clich\xE9 wants too\
  \ bad to get out of here.. We have bumped into each other in the last few years\
  \ for few stolen minutes, but I am convinced that our last intense meeting was five\
  \ years ago. I remember clearly, he popped up on the shaky cobblestones of Rome,\
  \ as I have tried to cruise as fancy with my wheelchair through the romantic alleys\
  \ as those Roman riders do. How naive I was... I thought seriously that I will see\
  \ last time the charming and sarcastic expressions of Sir ChallEdge, when he really\
  \ pushed me to my edge as I was slaloming on the seven hills of the Eternal City.\n\
  For some February means the month of Valentine, although I would call it rather\
  \ as the rollercoaster month, since this year I had the luck to meet the Sir again\
  \ between some silly ups and downs thanks to dreamy winter decision.\nChallEdge\
  \ has tought me first time to ski and fly in duet through the heights of Fado in\
  \ Alfama. If it\u2019s about duet and love without condition, we have learnt the\
  \ profession of living statues in the shape of Jin and Jang in a single bed. Learnt\
  \ my lesson by the power of angry ocean of Cascais, how to cut fog in vague curves\
  \ of Sintra. I managed to balance on sidewalks which are tinier than my skinny wheelchair.\
  \ Finally me, the par of Jin, have to admit that Jan has walked five hundred miles\
  \ for me to crawl down at my door. We crawled up hills until Bairo Alto, and reached\
  \ each other\u2019s threshold, we crossed the limits of predictable, and we got\
  \ united by passing the edge of Saudede, which has turned into the divine strength\
  \ of togetherness."
