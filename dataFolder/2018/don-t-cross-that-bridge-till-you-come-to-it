Text: "Jumping on the train seconds before the doors closed, I wished I had missed\
  \ it. That poster at gotten to me at the worst time possible. \"No Story starts\
  \ with \"It was cold, so I stayed home\"...\". I thought I decided change the course\
  \ of my life, the passing days at work, at school, at home. Yet that decision now\
  \ seemed to me the most pointless I had ever taken. I knew no one and no place in\
  \ that country; there had never been a reason for me to exist there.  \n\nAll that\
  \ I had seen looking at the destination board was the name Vilnius, which I remembered\
  \ seen in a mandatory language class back in school. For all I knew, all my teacher\
  \ had said had been lies and I had just asked the cab driver a ride to the printer\
  \ room instead of the Hotel. He seemed please with my answer, and commented he was\
  \ on finally meeting a tourist that could speak the language. \"Tourist don't care\
  \ about our culture\", he had said. He kept going about the weight of their ancestry\
  \ it had carried, and all the laws that were meant to protect it  while all I wanted\
  \ was to concentrate on the paintings car oil was creating over the rainwater in\
  \ the streets. \nAfter dropping me off, he had told me to call him the next day\
  \ if I wanted to see the city as a local. He may have been the friendliest person\
  \ I had met in months, or he simply had enjoyed the large tip I had left.\n I had\
  \ ended up calling him the next day. It had been his daughter who had shown up.\
  \ This bouncy, willing, full of hope twenty years old, who had never set foot outside\
  \ of her city since her birth. Maybe it was better this way; she must have explored\
  \ every single corner of this city not to get bored when staying in the same place\
  \ for twenty years. \n\nThat day she had asked more questions that she had answered.\
  \ While they say learning new languages opens your mind, I simply think it helps\
  \ you understand their struggles, the depth of the words that usually get lost in\
  \ translation. While I know I couldn't have found that hole-in-the-wall bar by myself,\
  \ what made the fact of being accompanied so special was having someone to share\
  \ those moments you could never explain with words to those who were not there;\
  \ in that precise moment, the smell lingering on my hands making me crave for a\
  \ second drink.\n\nHad I been a sentimental person I would have told you how that\
  \ day, we had built bridges that, not unlike the one we crossed that afternoon,\
  \ reunite people. But as a realist I will simply show you my next train ticket."
