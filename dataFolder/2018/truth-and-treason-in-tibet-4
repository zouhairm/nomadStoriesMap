Text: "A pilgrim climbs on past. Clack, clack, clack.  Stick staccato on slabs of\
  \ stone.  She pulls her weight of technicolor bones up each stair.  Her eyes hidden\
  \ by layers of time, fixed on the mala beads in her hand. She utters silent prayers.\
  \ For her deliverance and the enlightenment of all beings. \n\nOm Mane Padme Om.\n\
  \nI squint up. Sipping breaths like sour yak butter tea, another wave of nausea\
  \ hits. The Potala Palace, the seat of the gods, rises up like some anime castle\
  \ in the distance.  Beckoning.\n\n\u201COld lady beat you!\u201D A familiar voice\
  \ chuckles, that Tibetan humour never so far from the surface.\nI take the bait,\
  \ facing Lopsang with a scowl.\n\u201CHow many more steps my friend? Surely almost\
  \ there?\u201D\n \u201CAlmost there, yes - just two thousand to go.\u201D \nI sigh.\n\
  \nHe wore just a simple matching tracksuit, another Western addition to Tibet since\
  \ China's silent invasion.  Yet it seemed to me that Lopsang was no ordinary tour\
  \ guide.  He peered out over the rafters of the mountain monastery. Floating halfway\
  \ between the Earth and heavens, the air suddenly becomes electric.  A quick glance\
  \ around ensures we are alone.\n\n\u201CMother lake, she once lay here. Sacred to\
  \ my people.\u201D The sound rings out like a prayer, over the lifeless expanse\
  \ of concrete below.  \n\nI shiver.  It has nothing to do with the altitude, but\
  \ far more to do with the five military check points we had passed through.  I pull\
  \ my yak blanket tighter.\n\n\u201CA Chinese guide,\u201D Lopsang gives a wry wink.\
  \ \u201CWould tell you only of the monument erected for the great liberation of\
  \ Tibet. To the greatness of Mao.\u201D\n\nThough we had met just a few days ago,\
  \ he had dropped his air of suspicion. I had become a confidante to this at once\
  \ strong yet vulnerable man. I was surprised at the surge of affection rushing through\
  \ me. A girl simply longing for adventure, I found myself suddenly in alliance with\
  \ exiled Tibet.  \n\nI don\u2019t remember how many months later Lopsang stopped\
  \ responding to my emails.  He just disappeared without a trace, like so many of\
  \ his people before him.  I hoped for the best, but was comforted with the thought\
  \ of how blessed his next life would be.  No longer in his matching tracksuit, but\
  \ cloaked in his true colours.  The burnt saffron of the Palace monks.  \n\n."
