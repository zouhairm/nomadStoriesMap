Text: "There I was, sitting on the cold steps of Monument to Alfonso Xll, alone. My\
  \ simple bread & cheese sandwich, in which I had prepared earlier that day in my\
  \ hostel, was the perfect simple lunch for a simple girl traveling simply. \n  \
  \   As the day progressed into the early afternoon, I watched silently as many people\
  \ went about their interactive lives around me.  A couple in front of me shared\
  \ a long passionate kiss. A family to my left laughed at their trip photos. Floating\
  \ in The Retiro Park Lake, a father and his daughter embarked on a day long adventure.\
  \ \n     As the shadows began to change direction, I decided it was time to give\
  \ up my now warm seat to those who weren't ALONE. Migrating to a nice bench further\
  \ from the water, I took a seat and began to write. Even though secluded, I enjoyed\
  \ every moment of the warm, afternoon sun, laughter, and over all energy of the\
  \ people filling the space. \n     Within 30 minutes of sitting there, alone, an\
  \ older gentleman came and sat next to me. After a brief moment, I took the bold\
  \ action of offering him some of my snack I was munching on. With a smile, he graciously\
  \ excepted and reciprocated by offering a small candy. These simple gestures opened\
  \ us both up right away!\n    We learned of each others lives, dreams, goals, accomplishments,\
  \ failures... And we did so without words. Yes, that's right. Fernando, born and\
  \ raised in Madrid spoke Spanish and I, born and raised in Michigan, spoke English.\
  \ \n       What a sight that we must have been; A young girl trying to explain with\
  \ charades \"born in a small town\"  and an older gentleman using his cane to draw\
  \  \"my younger son is very smart\". Fernando and I sat there for over 3 hours.\
  \ We laughed, cried, held hands... And then all of a sudden it hit me... \n    \
  \ I was NOT alone. Furthest thing! In a space filled with people, we are only alone\
  \ if we choose to be. All it takes to fill the empty void we call ALONE is a genuine\
  \ desire for human connection. \n     Never have I struggled with meeting new people.\
  \ When traveling, I am constantly making new friends. The difference in my recent\
  \ trip to Madrid, Spain was that not only was I physically alone, but also allowed\
  \ myself to mentally embody that solitude. I chose to be alone... until I decided\
  \ to not be!  Connecting with Fernando, I rediscovered the importance of allowing\
  \ others in. One will not receive unwanted girls. Go out into the world with you\
  \ heart & mind both open, ready to experience life to it's fullest!"
