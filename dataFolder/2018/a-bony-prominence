Text: '"Careful there!", Noel shrieked as I stumbled on the pebbled slope that led
  to the riverbank. There was no solid ground underneath; only layers of pebbles and
  rocks which started running as soon as our feet touched them.

  "This was a bad idea", I said. "There''s no chance we can reach the guesthouse by
  moonrise."


  Noel looked at me with a frown. "You were the one looking for adventure in the first
  place", he said. "Now once you''re in it, there''s no looking back mate!"

  I knew he was only stating the obvious. We were lost in the middle of the Himalayan
  desert and the only way we could find the road back to our guesthouse was to follow
  the sole speck of light on the opposite hill. The dot looked inordinately close
  but the silted river valley in the middle made me realize how far away it was.


  We resumed our treacherous hike downhill, tripping and almost falling at every step.

  The river seemed amusingly calm and tranquil from the elevation we were at, let
  alone the gushing sound of its flow.

  Halfway down the pebbled slope, Noel tripped on something and fell hard on his palms.
  "Fuck", he yelled. "Help me get up, will ya?"

  As I leaned forward and lent him a hand, I noticed that he had tripped on something
  acutely cylindrical.

  A pipe?

  An offshoot?

  Perhaps a bone?


  Peering at it by way of the evanescent light, what I saw made a cold shiver run
  down my spine. It was indeed a huge bone shoved mechanically inside a shoe!'
