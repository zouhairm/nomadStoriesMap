Text: "A few years ago, I travelled to Cuba. I planned the trip and thought I was\
  \ prepared. But soon after being there, I noticed that there was something off.\
  \ Every time I tried to interact with Cubans I found barriers: supermarkets only\
  \ for foreigners, segregated services, people prevented from talking to me. I was\
  \ starting to feel in a bubble and frankly a bit concerned. Was I going to leave\
  \ Cuba without really understanding Cubans?\n\nI decided to rent a car and pick\
  \ up random people. There was a reason why. The days before I noticed that hundreds\
  \ of people waited for buses that never came. When the day started winding down,\
  \ and the sun became red, so did their faces, with desperation. For some it would\
  \ mean not getting back home. People commute to the capital, from 20 or 30 miles\
  \ away, but are never sure they can make it back. After sun down, buses don't stop.\
  \ My car was like a vessel in a sea of desperation. \n\nAround 6 p.m., I was heading\
  \ back to my hotel happy with all the different stories I had shared. The sunlight\
  \ was fading away and the sky was becoming dark. On the dusty road, there were two\
  \ people walking as if they were too tired to take another step. A brown-haired\
  \ woman had a tiny five-year-old boy clenching to her hand. I stopped close to them.\
  \ Their big, dark eyes, looked at me. They hesitated for a few seconds, but decided\
  \ to come in. After what seemed an eternity, she started speaking. Later on, I understood\
  \ that she was worried I was an undercover agent of the dictatorship. Fortunately,\
  \ my Spanish accent left her at ease. State agents wouldn't take the time to learn\
  \ such a strange accent, she told me. They were returning to their village after\
  \ a doctor's appointment. She explained how difficult it was to be a single mother\
  \ in Cuba, to make ends meet, dealing with food rationing and an income of 6 dollars\
  \ a month. It took her almost one hour to start speaking about freedom of speech.\
  \ My heart went out to her, for having to live with such fear. I stayed with them\
  \ until the sky was filled with stars and there was no light in sight. We spoke\
  \ about everything, as if we were childhood friends. They were curious about my\
  \ country, of which they knew only football players. I smiled when she told me that.\
  \ It wasn't a first, nor a last. It was strange leaving Carmen and Diego. Never\
  \ spoke to them again, of course. I sometimes wonder if they are somewhere in the\
  \ middle of the road, waiting for a gentle soul to stop."
