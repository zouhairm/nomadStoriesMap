Text: "Kasol is\_a tiny village in the state of Himachal Pradesh, India. I went there\
  \ one July from Shimla to Kullu in 8 hours. It was already around 9 pm. We decided\
  \ to wander a little in this little town which was lit up with small road sides\
  \ shops meant to sell Israeli clothes and beautiful accessories. As we were walking\
  \ on the silent streets, we moved past\_a board pointing towards some Jim Morrison\
  \ cafe. This cafe was a small trek up on the hills. It was pitch dark and scary.\
  \ We kept moving until we saw a small meadow. Past it was a gate, looked like a\
  \ private property. I knocked. Someone peeked out. I asked \u201CJim Morrison Cafe?\u201D\
  . The guy let us in.\nInside they were broadcasting Johnny Depp\u2019s Black Mass.\
  \ We had the best pan cakes and pizza here, played some board games, smoked shisha\
  \ (Hukkah), heard some awesome\_trance out there, had the delicious food and conversations\
  \ before we left for our guest house.\n\nDay 2 \u2013 Oh Magic View!\n\nNext morning,\
  \ from the restaurant we could see a half broken bridge crossing the river just\
  \ minutes from our guest house. So we decided to explore the other side of the bridge.\
  \ The bridge looked really old and had a broken fence on one side. As we crossed\
  \ it was all trek and trek on the other end. We decided to walk towards a cafe Oh\
  \ Magic View which was on a small trek towards up. As we reached there we were greeted\
  \ with a friendly owner of the cafe who liked\_to call himself Chilluminati. We\
  \ sat there relaxing intrigued by the view which boasted of the glorious mountains\
  \ all around. This guy played some of the best trance and spent time with us along\
  \ with some other friends of his sharing his funny stories.\n\nThe next morning\
  \ we decided to end our Kasol trip here with heavy hearts and head back onto our\
  \ next destination Old Manali as we had very less time on hand which we had managed\
  \ to steal from our busy hectic work lives back there in Singapore. We bid farewell\
  \ to this beautiful calm place. This was all\_about Kasol.\nBest way\_to reach \u2013\
