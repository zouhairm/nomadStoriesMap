Text: "\u201CListen to my chest\u201D, he grunts into my ears to loosen my stiffness.\
  \ I\u2019m attempting my first steps in tango in the arms of a heavily perfumed\
  \ fake-tanned macho in an unbuttoned shirt and a golden cross necklace.\n\nRoman\
  \ holiday. After three days under the burning sun I\u2019ve decided to retreat from\
  \ endless walks over ancient cobbles to yet another baroque church, dirty traffic\
  \ and the lingering smell of tourists\u2019 sweat. So instead of standing in line\
  \ for the Colosseum, on the fourth night I escape that ordeal for some \u201Cauthentic\
  \ tango milonga\u201D (dancing soir\xE9e) in a dodgy suburb in river proximity.\
  \ The event holds place in a run-down gym, the unexpected rain almost violating\
  \ its close-to-cardboard roof. It had been explained to me that tango was born as\
  \ a past-time for Italian dockworkers in Buenos Aires. A dance of the people. Once\
  \ inside, I can see how one wouldn\u2019t only locate the dance in a 20\u2019s ballroom\
  \ in Paris. \n\nAs I try not to trip over Roberto\u2019s feet, cheap prosecco is\
  \ inexorably flowing into plastic cups, Romans of all ages blathering away on shaky\
  \ ale-benches to the soundtrack of a classic Piazzolla CD. The dance floor is filled\
  \ with men in classy black suits and curvy goddesses in figure-hugging robes, that\
  \ seem to have effortlessly stepped out of a different era and found their place\
  \ in the stuffiness of this saloon. Long sensual gazes help the men find their partners.\
  \ My glance over my invasive dance partner's shoulder finally rests on the one outstanding\
  \ performance on the dance floor. \n\nSwirling feet. Sweating foreheads pressed\
  \ against each other. Calf caresses. Intertwined hands. Absolute standstills after\
  \ melodic passages alternating with legs being wildly kicked into the air. It\u2019\
  s hard to tell whether tantric improvisation and ballet made love as a social dance\
  \ or whether I\u2019m witnessing a fight that nobody loses. Never have I seen such\
  \ intimacy without an undertone of vulgarity before. It is impossible for the spectator\
  \ to make out the lead, both seem to take and yield control in enciphered patterns.\
  \ How can they choreograph the music whilst exhibiting technical perfection at this\
  \ pace? My eyes remain glued onto the couple in envy until the last bars of the\
  \ Libertango have faded away.\n\nAnd suddenly it occurs to me. It\u2019s two men.\
  \ Cheesy-grin boy opposite me starts to notice my distraction as I stop moving in\
  \ confusion, so I ask him about my astounding discovery. He smirks, giving me a\
  \ cheeky wink: \u201CIn tango, anyone can match.\u201D"
