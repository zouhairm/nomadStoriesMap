Text: "\u201CWe are approaching the \u2018soul of the dead,\u2019 says our tour guide,\
  \ Ricardo.\n    I look at my grandfather, dragging his feet. He slowly puts one\
  \ foot in front of the other as if the ground might split open at any moment. The\
  \ cold breeze ruffles the strays of white hair he has left on his head. He smiles\
  \ at me. His eyes are warmer than the sunlight\u2019s rays piercing through the\
  \ branches of the forest trees.\n    \u201CHow much further?\u201D my grandfather\
  \ asks.\n    \u201CNot much,\u201D Ricardo says. He wipes the beads of sweat off\
  \ his tan forehead. \n    Two monarch butterflies dance in the wind and perch themselves\
  \ on a branch. The sounds of wings flapping encourages me to keep hiking. My grandfather\
  \ groans and stops walking. Ricardo and I stop beside him.\n    \u201CThe Purepecha\u2019\
  s believed that the monarch butterflies were ancestors visiting them as butterflies,\u201D\
  \ Ricardo says. He glances at the edge of the mountain above us. There are branches\
  \ of fir trees drenched with a kaleidoscope of orange, black, and white. \n    \u201C\
  They get their colors from the poisonous leaves which they eat in order to fortify\
  \ themselves and scare away predators,\u201D he watches my grandfather carefully.\
  \ I look at his wrinkles which seemed to have deepened in the last hour. He is breathing\
  \ heavily.\n    \u201CThey\u2019ve come from the Rocky Mountains in order to migrate\
  \ here in Michoacan,\u201D he points to the butterfly-soaked sea above us. \n  \
  \  \u201CIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201D my grandpa says, between breaths. \n    I nod\
  \ at him, eager to approach the top of the mountain. Now I understand why we woke\
  \ up at the crack of dawn to hike this trail.\n    \u201CI\u2019ll wait for you\
  \ here,\u201D he smiles, sadly. I wrap my arms around him. His emaciated body feels\
  \ fragile against mine. \n    \u201CI promise to take pictures,\u201D I say. He\
  \ nods, unable to speak.\n    The tour guide and I reach the top of the mountain.\
  \ \n    \u201CThe soul of the dead,\u201D he says, spreading his hand across the\
  \ view. \n    Hundreds of thousands of butterflies hover in the sky and fly to the\
  \ branches of the fir foliage where they look like clusters of wings, forming trees\
  \ made out of one massive butterfly. I walk closer to their home, scanning the grass,\
  \ careful not to accidentally step on one. \n    I take out my phone and search\
  \ for the perfect angle for my grandfather to experience their beauty when I feel\
  \ tiny legs tickle my fingers. I glance at my hand and witness my encounter.\n \
  \   A monarch butterfly decided to perch itself on my hand, of all places."
