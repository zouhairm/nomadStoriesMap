Text: "I like to think of life as less of where you've been but more of what you've\
  \ seen. \nShe wasn't just my mother, she was my best friend and losing her was like\
  \ losing a hundred men in battle, she seemed to bring life to itself. Some might\
  \ even say she lived more than once.  \n\nShe'd been struggling inside for a long\
  \ time and If know anything, it's that she wasn't quite herself that year, things\
  \ just seemed to not add up as if she left a long time ago. One day, she rang my\
  \ phone while I was sitting in class. \" let's go home, I'm very sick, I can't anymore,\
  \ meet me at my work place around three \" she said. I ran towards her work place\
  \ at lightning speed and arrived to see a round figure, walking in what looked like\
  \ a dizzy spell. She still drove impeccably, being the woman she was; challenge\
  \ was just that, a mere word. Her growing up in a war, in an extremely impoverished\
  \ background, I seldom heard words of gratitude; she often showed affection through\
  \ her actions. \n\nWe stopped just before the house; she grabbed my arm and told\
  \ me that she was grateful I had been with her today. Not knowing what to say, I\
  \ quickly responded with a dull, no problem Mommy! I ran outside a little confused\
  \ and opened the gate for her to pull in. When we got inside, she quickly collapsed\
  \ into a bundle on her bed. \n\nMy farther immediately prepared dinner while I started\
  \ my homework; she lay there still as stone, very unlike her usual self. She generally\
  \ couldn't sleep without shifting the entire bed. \n\nThe next morning, at four,\
  \ her usual wake up time; saw her make breakfast, lunch and clean the kitchen whilst\
  \ having no sense of space and time. She could hardly breathe, her words turned\
  \ into coughing and coughing turned into wheezing and her wheezing eventually became\
  \ life support.\n\nIt was 2 weeks, getting to know my farther for the first time,\
  \ worrying about my mother and the constant looming protest action at university\
  \ not to mention, everyday stresses had me sort of cornered. The noise I so desperately\
  \ wanted to drown stopped. The deafening silence death brings is just too quiet\
  \ for sanity to keep you afloat. \n\n\"live your lives, I love you all\" Her final\
  \ words etched in memory. You're mostly humble because we only realize what's happening\
  \ once events unfold, a sort of terms and conditions life decrees. Maybe the only\
  \ two certain things in life are death and taxes, for now all I can say I that reality\
  \ is fluid. On the bright side I don't think I've met anyone who's caught catch\
  \ 22."
