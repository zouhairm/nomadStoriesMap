Text: "In May 2014, my wife (Krissy) and I, fed up with the daily grind in the DC\
  \ suburbs, took a five month sabbatical. After much planning, we left our jobs,\
  \ packed our house, dropped the cats off with friends, and hit the road \u2013 Destination:\
  \ North. We spent weeks driving up the east coast, often camping along the way.\
  \ Our end goal was Newfoundland \u2013 a place we had always wanted to visit. Along\
  \ the way, among other things, Krissy and I hiked to a mountaintop cabin in New\
  \ Hampshire, partied in Halifax, spent a week working on a goat farm in Nova Scotia,\
  \ visited the Viking ruins in L\u2019Anse aux Meadows, got \u201Cscreeched-in\u201D\
  \ at a tavern in Twillingate, and camped for a week in frigid Gros Morne.\n\nIn\
  \ June, we made our way to the small coastal community of Trinity East, where we\
  \ were to spend a few weeks living and volunteering at the charming Skerwink Hostel.\
  \  To say that it was outside of our comfort zone would be an understatement. Soon,\
  \ however, it became our comfort zone. Still early in the season, we had plenty\
  \ of time to get to know the ropes. We\u2019d put in our three hours of work each\
  \ day and then explore the stunning Bonavista Peninsula. Over the next few weeks,\
  \ not only did we get to know the community well, but we got to know the people\
  \ in the community, many of whom hung out at the hostel. Most were native Newfoundlanders\
  \ while many had visited and just couldn\u2019t bear to leave. We were starting\
  \ to feel that way ourselves but, after three weeks, our time was up and we were\
  \ on to the next leg of our journey.\n\nDoing similar work in St. John\u2019s, I\
  \ fell in love with the city but we both missed Trinity East. After a month, we\
  \ drew an X through our itinerary and arranged to return to that peaceful coast.\
  \ Reunited with our friends from June, as well as many new characters, we had the\
  \ time of our lives. Two weeks turned into five, and we really had to peel ourselves\
  \ away when the time did come. It was another month of travel, southward at a snail\u2019\
  s pace, before we returned to our normal lives. During that time, we had some fantastic\
  \ adventures, but nothing warmed our hearts like Trinity East.\n\nIn the years since,\
  \ we\u2019ve remained in touch with many of our friends there and have returned,\
  \ as visitors, on several occasions. One of our dreams is to eventually move there,\
  \ at least seasonally. When we left for The Big Trip, which was the boldest move\
  \ either of us had ever made, we hoped we would make some kind of connection along\
  \ the way. We never expected we would find \u201Chome\u201D."
