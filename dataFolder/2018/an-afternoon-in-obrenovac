Text: "I waited in the shade of the scraggly tree, cross-legged on a musty blanket,\
  \ feeling the stiffness of the once-soft material. I\u2019d been in Serbia only\
  \ a week and in Obrenovac less than that, but already I withered from the 40 degree\
  \ heat, and the fabric of my loose trousers stuck to my skin.\nThey\u2019d waved\
  \ me over\u2014 the group of young men with dark hair and an eroding sort of homesickness,\
  \ and they sat with me now and we chatted a little. Presently, a watermelon which\
  \ others had carried from somewhere in town arrived and Zeya sliced it into glistening\
  \ pieces. I watched him take a pinch of salt from a little container Yosep had produced\
  \ from a pocket somewhere and sprinkle it over the piece of watermelon, methodically,\
  \ in a practiced way that suggested he\u2019d done it many times before. \nHe\u2019\
  d worked for the Americans once, in another place, far away but just as hot.\n\u201C\
  I was one of only six hackers in the country,\u201D he\u2019d said proudly, a thumb\
  \ stuck to his chest, a little below the Nike logo. \nI wondered where the other\
  \ five were now. Perhaps the Taliban had forced them to leave, too. \nI watched\
  \ the salt crystals melt into the flesh of the watermelon, and wondered if he\u2019\
  d ever see Afghanistan again. I glanced at the men sitting around me\u2014the 19\
  \ and 20 year old's with their legs crossed and their shoulders dampened underneath\
  \ the heavy leaden sunlight and the fatigue of a night spent trying to sneak across\
  \ borders. I thought of Saheb Shah playing basketball behind me, and Ali napping\
  \ somewhere in one of the whitewashed buildings that had once been barracks for\
  \ soldiers and was now his residence but would never be his home. Would any of them\
  \ ever see their countries again? \nThe watermelon would be succulent and fresh\
  \ in this stifling heat which packed us in and made the dusty field feel like a\
  \ box of cotton wool. Zeya plucked the pieces from the rind with two fingers and\
  \ extended us each a piece in turn. I\u2019d never had watermelon with salt before.\
  \ When I took a bite, it tasted wrong. It tasted weird. It was two different worlds\
  \ meshing on my tongue, and my taste buds didn\u2019t know quite what to make of\
  \ it. I suppose it was appropriate for the situation: strange and not quite right.\n\
  I was, after all, sitting in a refugee camp. \nBut I did not want them \u2014the\
  \ men sitting with me\u2014 to know how I recoiled at the idea, so I smiled and\
  \ nodded and finished my watermelon, and each of us licked the juice from our fingers\
  \ as we sat together in silence, sweating in the heat."
