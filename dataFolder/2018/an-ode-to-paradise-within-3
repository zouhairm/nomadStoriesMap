Text: "One day, my partners ditched me from business and I was clueless, as everything\
  \ happened in a jiffy. I flew back from Kolkata to Ahmedabad with nothing, not even\
  \ myself.  I wanted to run away and that\u2019s exactly what I did. One day, a friend\
  \ uttered the word Tushita, after little surfing, I decided to go on a solo trip.\
  \ Tushita, a Centre for the study of Buddhism from the Tibetan Mahayana tradition,\
  \ located in Northern India. The course \u201CIntroduction to Buddhism\u201D was\
  \ a ten day retreat. My trip begin from Ahemdabad to Delhi, I was excited as well\
  \ as nervous. From Delhi to Himachal, I took a local state transport bus at night\
  \ & reached Dharamshala at 6 am. After a cup of Chai, I took the local Chagda to\
  \ take me to Tushita. The first look of the place was like into the wild, it was\
  \ not because of the infrastructure but the stillness.There was a small office,\
  \ the curly haired girl with a fair complexion was a Canadian, came to volunteer\
  \ her services to Tushita. Our batch comprised of 120 students, from across the\
  \ globe having only 12 Indians. The schedule was hectic starting from 5.30 am comprised\
  \ of theory sessions, meditations, and yoga and group discussions having in between\
  \ three meals a day. We were only allowed to interact in the group discussions between\
  \ lectures once in a day. I became restless and thought I don\u2019t belong here,\
  \ all the good and beautiful feelings vanished from my heart for first two days.\
  \ The third day, I felt slowly and steadily everything was sinking in. Day after\
  \ day, my understanding of myself became deeper, during the meditation sessions,\
  \ I was filled with grief, resentment, and forgiveness. I had tears during those\
  \ sessions and I am sure they were tears of joy. It made me feel that we live in\
  \ a very small world and it\u2019s a miniature of the Universe. Every person there\
  \ was living his own journey of exploration but this time something within, something\
  \ deeper, something more, something bigger than themselves.On the last day, there\
  \ was some magic in the air, the connection was mutual, with the place, with the\
  \ people and more importantly with myself. My heart, body, mind and soul was in\
  \ sync and devoted to the emptiness of the Universe. I had those invisible wings\
  \ which had no limits, I wanted to fly more, love more, and connect more with the\
  \ world now. The universe was opening arms to take me in. We all run to be many,\
  \ but all this inclusiveness is to be one, whole and it\u2019s in the moment and\
  \ we become that moment, that only connection."
