Text: "Just beyond Mexico\u2019s border is a billboard that reads, \u201CIf you\u2019\
  re here for child sex tourism....\u201D The background is a man behind bars. Further\
  \ on are giant, colorful block letters that spell 'BELIZE' - the kind tourists might\
  \ sit upon and take pictures. Here we'd find a country as dangerous as it is full\
  \ of beautiful surprises.\n\nOur bus ripped through dusty roads and sweaty towns\
  \ while locals wearing jeans and long shirts sold sweet mango slices with chili\
  \ flakes. In Belize City, we jumped onto a speedboat ferry headed for San Pedro\
  \ Town, on the island of Ambergris Caye. We arrived on the main pier, weary and\
  \ windburned, and set out onto a bustling, sand-packed road that teemed with reckless\
  \ careening golf carts.\n\nCoconut leaves blew heavy like leather, flapping in the\
  \ wind, and sounds of surf crashing on the distant reef filled the air. The island\
  \ was paradise, though hurricane season brings the very real threat of annihilation.\
  \ Snorkeling around the bay you can see a sunken graveyard of broken building materials,\
  \ ripped from their foundations. Since 1930, 33 hurricanes and tropical storms have\
  \ come close enough to cause damage or kill. A simple spark can wipe out an entire\
  \ neighborhood in no time. The city is used to being rebuilt and when disaster strikes,\
  \ everybody pitches in. \n\nWe befriended Eddie, a tall, slender man, on a narrow\
  \ beach path where locals give genuine smiles to passers by. His father was the\
  \ Minister of Tourism. One night while out walking, he came upon a burning house.\
  \ He ran inside and rescued a woman and child. He said he felt divinely compelled\
  \ to take a walk that night and he seemed serenely stuck in the awe of that moment.\
  \ \n\nWe arrived, unknowingly, a day before Carnaval, a 3-day festival of surreal\
  \ madness. People dress up as lobsters, jellyfish, and every other sea creature\
  \ imaginable, dancing through the streets for charitable donations. At night, the\
  \ city core is roped off. Inside becomes the greatest free-for-all acrylic paint\
  \ war zone imaginable. There are no rules, only smiles.\n\nEach night was devoted\
  \ to children, teens, and adults, in that order, but we joined in all three. We\
  \ made an ally army of children who became our tribe. At the end, soap bubbles,\
  \ water hoses, and music came on and we would wash off in the warm, dark ocean.\
  \ \n\nSome girls made us a wedding ring out of seaweed and married us right there,\
  \ with salt, soap, and paint stinging our eyes. Months later we were still smiling\
  \ and picking paint out of our hair."
