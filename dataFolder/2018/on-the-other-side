Text: "I was sitting on a table du trotoir having first breakfast in Tel Aviv after\
  \ a night flight: cappuccino, freshly baked bread and rich tomato stew with poached\
  \ eggs called shashuka, I tried it in Arabic countries. Street musicians made sunny\
  \ December morning feel like a spring. I watched people around, their clothes were\
  \ not fancy or though of, bodies were not beautiful. They were so imperfect and\
  \ happy. Locals around walked with their dogs, had coffee, read newspapers, greeted\
  \ each other. I could not help myself but to fall in love with this beautiful place,\
  \ though I came here with a very strong judgement on its history. But I was dying\
  \ from curiosity to see it by myself. \nI rented a room on this fancy George street\
  \ from a friendly gay couple who told me that Tel Aviv is one of the gay capitals\
  \ hosting annual Tel Aviv Pride in June. I stayed next to the Carmel market with\
  \ sweets, fruits, bakery, clothes and IPhone covers with comic pictures insulting\
  \ all possible world leaders. I bought myself a hat and randomly turned right, towards\
  \ the seaside. This is my favorite strategy to explore a new city - to get lost\
  \ there. \nI found myself in a quite beautiful area full of accurate white houses.\
  \ The architecture was not sophisticated, more like bold blocks, as most of the\
  \ houses in the city. But the flowers were flourishing at the balconies, small cafes\
  \ were full of people. on the tables I saw local humus (mash from chickpeas and\
  \ sesame paste tahini) and falafel (fried balls from green peas). These dishes are\
  \ also popular all over the Middle East.\nI reached seaside and few hours was gazing\
  \ to large waves and kite surfers. When its warmer, you can swim in few public beaches\
  \ nearby. Walking by the seaside you can reach the old city Jaffa. It was an Arabic\
  \ trade town when first Jewish settlements started to build up Tel Aviv next doors\
  \ in the middle of XX century. The Jaffa is a charming place on the mountain with\
  \ mosques, churches, art galleries, old houses. Here, on a Zodiac bridge, you may\
  \ find your sign engraved, hold it looking to the ocean and make a wish. Then explore\
  \ streets and markets in the Arabic area, buy carpets, local designers jewelry or\
  \ clothes. \nAt evening walk in the downtown to choose the most appealing restaurant\
  \ or bar and become part of this happy and relaxed crowd. That's how my heart was\
  \ stolen in a one day. And this was just a beginning of my two week journey across\
  \ the Israel, trip I dreamed about for several years. I finally was there."
