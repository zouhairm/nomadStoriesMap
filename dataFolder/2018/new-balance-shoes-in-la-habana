  \ \n\u201COne question\u201D\nThese phrases fill the air as you walk the streets\
  \ of La Habana.\n\u201CJineteros\u201D they call them. Hustlers.\nWe had learned\
  \ to ignore them, it was the second to last day of our two week trip. We were experts\
  \ by then, \u2018pretty much locals\u2019 we thought to ourselves, while smirking\
  \ at the new tourists who would stop to engage them.\n\u201COne question!\u201D\
  \ Keep walking and ignore them we tell ourselves.. \n\u201CPlease one question!\u201D\
  \ He runs up to us.\n\u201COh boy, here we go,\u201D my husband says to me as he\
  \ stops.\n\u201CReal New balance! Oh! I love the New Balance,\u201D the young Cuban\
  \ guy tells us, a small box of rum in his hand and the sway of someone whose been\
  \ drinking. In his broken English he tells us his name is Dani and explains that\
  \ New Balance is all the rage in Cuba but he cannot afford real ones, only knockoffs.\
  \ Dani eagerly tells us about his love for New Balance and then makes the universal\
  \ sign for trade, 24 cigars for the shoes. \nMy husband and I look at each other,\
  \ \u201Cwell that\u2019s different.\u201D We had been told by all the travel guides\
  \ not to buy cigars from offers off the street.,No one had ever said anything about\
  \ trading.\nMy native tongue is Spanish so I begin probing as to where the cigars\
  \ came from, suspicious and distrustful. Dani tells me that he works in the local\
  \ cigar factory and as an incentive, the government provides monthly cigar stipends\
  \ to workers. Of course these are the cigars with imperfections that are not up\
  \ to industry standards. Dani assures me that they are still good quality and made\
  \ from the same tobacco as the Cohiba cigars. He tells me that he collects his cigars\
  \ to sell and make extra money for his family.\nMy husband meanwhile notices the\
  \ Industriales baseball cap on one of Dani\u2019s friends and begins talking to\
  \ him. I translate that we had been to an Industriales baseball game earlier in\
  \ our trip and had been looking all over for an Industriales hat. \n\u201CIf you\
  \ can find us an Industriales hat, you have a deal,\u201D I tell Dani. My husband\
  \ surprised at my sudden bargaining skills. Dani thinks about this and quickly begins\
  \ plotting with his friend to find a hat for this American man. After some deliberation,\
  \ he smiles confidently and hugs us excitedly at the thought of being a New Balance\
  \ shoe owner. Not at all worried that they are dirty, worn, or far too big. They\
  \ are real New Balance shoes. \n\nAt 7:05, we begin walking down the Paseo Del Prado\
  \ towards dinner, New Balance shoes in hand."
