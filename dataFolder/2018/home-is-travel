Text: "For an Indian girl, the day begins with a cup of hot Chai shared with friends\
  \ and family. As her day unfolds she overhears intense political conversations ringing\
  \ out on the bus stop. She is alarmed by the honking horns and distracted by chanting\
  \ street hawkers. With the ever-growing chaos, the sun starts to set, the dust starts\
  \ to settle in. She rubs her feet at the door mat and rushes to the dinner table.\
  \ She rolls up thick curry into a piece of bread, torn off from its ends, preparing\
  \ to bite into it. She timidly looks up to the doting eyes watching her eat.\n \n\
  When she moves abroad to study, and later for work, one thing remains the same.\
  \ Each day begins with a cup of Chai. Because Chai is home. However, the heartwarming\
  \ meals are missing. The chaos is still there, but it lives in her mind now. She\
  \ gets her heart burnt and holds strings of her broken relationship. She becomes\
  \ depressed. She grows distant from her roots and has now begun searching for her\
  \ home. With lot of self-doubt, she pushes herself and embarks on her first ever\
  \ Solo backpacking trip to Thailand.\n \nHer skin starts to breath with the gushing\
  \ fresh air she feels on her face, as she roams on mopeds with the Thais on Bangkok\
  \ Streets. She walks the ruins of Buddhist temples with the Japanese. She drinks\
  \ beer with the Austrians and sings spanish songs with the Paraguayans.  She drops\
  \ off all her baggage and jumps in the blue waters feeling the sea hugging her tight.\
  \ She snorkels with eyes wide open to the moving color palette nature has added\
  \ to the sea. She watches monkeys swaying in mangrove forests, swims with strangers\
  \ across dark secret caves leading to remote Islands and plays darts with other\
  \ travelers in Irish Pubs. She ends and bookmarks each day in Thailand with a bleeding\
  \ red sunset so that when she turns over the pages of her life, she would never\
  \ miss these chapters. She feels she is home in this unknown place with a bunch\
  \ of strangers.\n\nShe is now back from her trip. All the people she met, be it\
  \ the solo bag-packers, the hotel manager on a remote Island, the local Kayaking\
  \ instructor learning Chinese or the vagabond now settled in Thailand appear happy,\
  \ they appear to be at home.  She ponders if there are different possibilities of\
  \ life and of home.\n\nAt her breakfast table, as the warmth of her cup presses\
  \ against her palms, the aroma of Chai gently blends in the air and she takes the\
  \ first sip. To her surprise, Chai isn't home anymore, Chai is travel."
