Text: "We landed on Spanish soil and I was home. The generous splashes of color on\
  \ every building fa\xE7ade, balcony and alcove; the garlands of artificial flowers,\
  \ decorating every nook and cranny; the cobble-stoned pathways; it was like a rainbow\
  \ had exploded over everything. There was unrestrained emotion everywhere, whether\
  \ it was the troubadours laying their heart on the line or the artiste selling his\
  \ soul on paper. One sketch magician proposed to me right there and I was dumbstruck.\
  \ \u201CI would want someone as colorful as you in my life\u201D were his words.\
  \ We Pakistanis, as a nation, have passive aggressiveness down to an art form, any\
  \ open displays of love and individuality are frowned upon, so it\u2019s fair to\
  \ say I felt these Spaniards were my people. Open, free, happy, colorful. There\
  \ was the Flamenco dance we attended at this local restaurant. I had a vague concept\
  \ of what Flamenco was; a lot of stomping of leather shoes and musical clappers,\
  \ but I was slightly taken aback by the sheer display of aggression and nonchalance.\
  \ The feminist in me rejoiced to see this beautiful woman with her game face on,\
  \ letting her man know he will rue the day he walked out on her. Though he is breaking\
  \ her heart he will never break her spirit! There was the Cathedral of Cordoba;\
  \ formerly the mosque of Cordoba, so many eons ago, when Muslims ruled over Spain,\
  \ torn down and rebuilt as a church; part of the mosque was saved for posterity.\
  \ This Cathedral is now a testament to the grandeur and decadence of both styles\
  \ of architecture. The stark difference between the two styles hits you quite violently,\
  \ where one is all about gilded opulence and gorgeous sculptures, the other uses\
  \ organic curves, spherical shapes and scripture as an art form. What struck me\
  \ most was how the same situation can affect people in such different ways; we were\
  \ a group of about 40 people, roughly divided down the middle in to two generations,\
  \ the old and the new, people in their late 20\u2019s and 30\u2019s and our parents.\
  \ Faced with the Cathedral, the oldies spent most of their time bawling over the\
  \ lost glory of the Muslims while the younger generation saw hope of coexistence,\
  \ peace and love. If we respect each other\u2019s differences we CAN all get along.\
  \  As I wiped a tear from my eye it was a proud moment for me. There is hope for\
  \ this generation yet.. I left Spain with a heavy heart and a very light pocket.\
  \ The ten odd days spent there are some of the favorite days in my life. I hope\
  \ I visit again some day"
