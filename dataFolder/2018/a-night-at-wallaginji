Text: "An ear-piercing screech filled the tent, my heart skipped a beat. Perhaps,\
  \ if I had been anywhere else, the screaming would have sent me running; but this\
  \ had become another part of my life on the island. \n\nCreeping from tents, a group\
  \ of us gathered at the edge of the campsite. Torches were turned off and a hum\
  \ of excitement started to pulse through the lucky few intruders. Our black mass\
  \ crouched and moved silently towards the beach, the bright moon made easy work\
  \ of spotting our target. The coral sand was decorated with hundreds of slow-moving\
  \ figures marching to the perfect real estate. \n\nSouth of Australia's Great Barrier\
  \ Reef lies a little-known paradise known to local Aborigines as Wallaginji, or\
  \ 'beautiful reef'.  A bird rookery, home to screeching Shearwaters, where a hat\
  \ protects more from showers of poo than from the sun. For just a few weeks each\
  \ year, this hidden nirvana becomes a nursery to thousands of soon-to-be hatchlings.\
  \ \n\nWe continued an awkward commando crawl, following the expectant mother in\
  \ a tense silence. Our presence was not welcome, scaring away one of these turtles\
  \ would cost her a laying opportunity; one she may not get back this season. \n\n\
  Past the ragged coral, she had found her place in the soft sand, a barrier of Pisonia\
  \ trees perhaps a comfort to her now, although the nesting natives would be far\
  \ from nurturing to her hatchlings. My entire body tensed, motionless as her inelegant\
  \ flippers began digging. Sand flicked into my eyes which I refused to close, at\
  \ risk of missing the event we had trespassed onto her territory to glimpse. \n\n\
  I had lost track of the hours, the only marker of time the slow progression of the\
  \ chamber. I held my camera tightly in my hand, simultaneously scared to ruin and\
  \ to miss reliving this moment. My eyes had adjusted to the dull glow provided from\
  \ above, beginning to notice the audience surrounding the performance. We were watched\
  \ lazily from above by Shearwaters. Their spine-tingling conversations apparently\
  \ unheard by the mother. \n\nA sharp inhale beside me brought me back to her, positioned\
  \ low over her handiwork, the mother began laying her ping-pong ball-like eggs into\
  \ their new womb. \n\nThe first indication of the morning peeked over the horizon,\
  \ signalling our time to leave. We marched away slowly back to our own territory."
