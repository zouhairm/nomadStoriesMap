Text: "Suddenly I am sitting on an airplane, one-way, straight to Quito, Ecuador.\
  \ As I am writing down my first feelings I notice that they are mixed with fear\
  \ and happiness. I am ready to start an unforgettable adventure that undoubtedly\
  \ pushed me to the edge. August 2016: I feel goosebumps run over my whole body as\
  \ I arrive in the middle of the night, stepping the first time into South America.\
  \ I finally find my driver from the hostel to pick me up and off we go to Quito.\
  \ The decision was made six months earlier to leave interpreter school and teach\
  \ myself Spanish through a real adventure. I want to dream and think in it. I knew\
  \ this kind of feeling wouldn\u2019t ever be taught to me in any classroom. But\
  \ going abroad for a whole year and taking Spanish classes is unbelievably expensive\
  \ and almost impossible as being a student. So I started to save up as much money\
  \ as I can, I was running from one morning shift at a restaurant to another restaurant\
  \ for evening shift and off to South America I was. One way. After I spent some\
  \ beautiful weeks volunteering in the little village of Pucar\xE1, my way leads\
  \ me to a beautiful market in a town called Otavalo. There I met an artesanial who\
  \ gave me a piece of jewellery with the words \u201CEvery traveler needs something\
  \ that protects him on his way. Let me give you this, it will put the right people\
  \ along your way\u201C Always when I was scared I remembered his words and just\
  \ let the adventures come find me. I found a beautiful hostel to work for a room\
  \ and food in Salinas, Ecuador. Looking back on it, this hostel was the best and\
  \ hardest \u201Cschool\u201D I could have ever gotten into and it was the beginning\
  \ of me falling in love with the Arginine culture, their delicious food, their people\
  \ and especially their way of sharing and caring for friends. In total, we were\
  \ four volunteers. Meli and Simon, a couple from Argentina, Mati, also from Argentina\
  \ and me. Days like going to the market or laughing together at an evening around\
  \ the fireplace, those were my Spanish classes. After two months I returned to the\
  \ hostel and met up with my Argentine friends to celebrate Christmas. Through speaking\
  \ better Spanish I got the chance to get to know my friends another time. Every\
  \ little \u201Cfamily\u201D I had made along the way made me leave a piece of my\
  \ heart in many places of South America with special people. How I ended up on a\
  \ Catamaran sailing all the way down the Caribbean and got dropped off in Colombia\
  \ and started exploring Argentina\u2026 to be continued."
