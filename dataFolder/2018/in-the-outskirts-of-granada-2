Text: "With my first salary, I had wanted to reward myself and finally explore Andaluc\xED\
  a. During my language course in Seville I had gotten accustomed to the heat of mid-May\
  \ and realized that my Spanish was not as good as I would have thought. \nWith my\
  \ journey from Seville to Granada, my time of settling in had come to its end. I\
  \ did not know anything, but my doubts if I would find my way, stay in areas considered\
  \ safe or\u2013 make it to the Alhambra in time for my pre-assigned slot to enter\
  \ and see this miracle of Muslim architecture and art for myself. \nOnce I arrived\
  \ in my hostel, I noticed the announcement of a free walking tour starting in a\
  \ few minutes: David had moved from the UK to Spain a year ago with his father and\
  \ already managed to integrate completely into the local scene with his positive,\
  \ easy-going attitude. He wanted to show our group not only the known sights that\
  \ we could explore by ourselves, but rather give us a feel for the town, its people\
  \ and show us hidden gems. Within a few minutes, David had charmed our little group\
  \ and formed a group of friends out of complete strangers.\nWe walked the Albaicin\
  \ \u2013 where I would never have wandered being a greenhorn in travelling solo\
  \ \u2013, found some of the most beautiful lushly planted patios, but did not miss\
  \ the world-famous view from the Mirador de San Nicolas, either, to get the best\
  \ shot of the Alhambra. \nHowever, David had a different ending for our tour in\
  \ mind: those of us willing to brave the heat of the early afternoon sun he took\
  \ to a friend of his to experience the traditional gitano (\u201Cgypsy\u201D) culture.\
  \ The guy we were to visit did not live in one of the caves of the Albaicin, but\
  \ in a small wood cabin in the hills surrounding Granada. We left the borders of\
  \ town to hike through still green hills, meadows and passed thorny bushes on our\
  \ way to the top and the cabin. There, on the terrace of this little place of peace\
  \ we had a break together with David and our host in the shade of his trees. His\
  \ wife spoilt us with tea that was served in Turkish tea glasses and self-made cookies,\
  \ garnished with kiwi and fresh strawberries which \u2013 following the original\
  \ purpose of tapas \u2013 topped the tea glass\u2019 opening.\nEver since I have\
  \ been to Spain a lot \u2013 my Spanish has gotten much better and I am able to\
  \ communicate with locals perfectly! \u2013 and stayed in many different homes,\
  \ but no matter where I am, I always remember this wood cabin as the most personal\
  \ and original place I had the chance to get to know."
