Text: "\u201CWait, where did all the cows go?\u201D you'd think as you arrive in Goa\
  \ from New Delhi, as I did in February. Goa seems like another world, or another\
  \ dimension of India, if you may. However, do not associate it with tropical pictures\
  \ tourists share\u2013it has much more to offer.\nAfter enjoying your day or two\
  \ on the beach, under palm trees, sipping coconuts, a little adventurer inside you\
  \ will start ranting out of boredom. That's time you start looking for the real\
  \ Goa.\nFirst thing we did was finding a perfect place for dinners. There was a\
  \ surprise \u2013 local Indian Johnny had a caf\xE9 right by the sea called \u201C\
  Kolya caf\xE9\u201D. Johnny was the nicest to Russian-speakers and offered his secret\
  \ menu, which contained rare kinds of fish and better drinks. \u201CThank god Russian\
  \ is my second language\u201D I thought surprised at that coming up on the coast\
  \ of Indian Ocean. If you\u2019re ever in Goa \u2013 try the grilled Royal Shrimp\
  \ and risk not wanting any shrimp anywhere else ever in your life.\nNow, to the\
  \ highlight of our trip. Imagine Portugal with its little cozy streets, colourful\
  \ European architecture and smiley people everywhere. Add Indian people, also happy\
  \ and peaceful, and tons of tourists \u2013 there you have it, Panjim.\nI got off\
  \ the rickshaw in front of a white church and felt teleported to somewhere in Pyrenees.\
  \ Our Lady of Immaculate Conception Church, huge snow-white baroque building placed\
  \ on the highest hill, makes you have medieval scenes in your head with gorgeous\
  \ women lighting candles and praying. Then you see fancy palm trees surrounding\
  \ it and your brain gets confused AND mesmerized. Look around and smile at a book\
  \ store of blueberry yogurt colour, banana cream supermarket and chocolate bank\
  \ office.\nStrolling along the river you will see a fleet of casino ferries. Take\
  \ a cone of the best mango ice cream on a way to a ferry ride. On the ship, the\
  \ locals will teach you how to dance Portuguese on stage - a wagon of fun is guaranteed!\n\
  If someone asked me for a full of surprises destination for travel \u2013 I would\
  \ suggest Goa, because, damn, you got to feel it! We were dizzy, liberated and ecstatic.\
  \ The smiles of beggars playing with their tiny kids outside your window of Domino\u2019\
  s, numerous ferries shining at night, the most humid breeze warming you to bones,\
  \ old couple selling unique souvenirs in their little shop, tuk-tuk drivers telling\
  \ stories, Johnny and his shrimps, greenest grass, smoothest roads, hippies, locals\
  \ running over to take selfies \u2013 isn\u2019t it the best endorphin?!"
