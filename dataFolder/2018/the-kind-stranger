Text: "Of course I was reluctant to trust him considering only hours earlier I was\
  \ taken to a back alley and sold counterfeit cigars, but there was something about\
  \ him that made me think everything was going to be OK \u2014 so off I went exploring\
  \ the depths of Havana with this kind stranger. \n\nI met Aliz\xE9 alongside the\
  \ world famous Malec\xF3n in Havana, Cuba. I was admiring the Morro Castle off in\
  \ the distance when he approached me asking me where I was from. When I answered\
  \ Canada we immediately hit it off bonding over our shared love of Justin Bieber\
  \ where he proceeded to sing the chorus of \u201CSorry\u201D which was all the rage\
  \ that year. \n\nAfter chatting for a couple of minutes he asked me if I wanted\
  \ a local tour of the city. He could tell I was hesitant, after all it was only\
  \ my second day in Cuba and I had already fallen victim to a common scam.\n\nHe\
  \ wasn\u2019t pushy and he waited patiently while I gathered my thoughts. As I tried\
  \ to rationalize the situation I asked myself, \u201Cwhere is your sense of adventure?\u201D\
  \ \n\nSo, I decided to go with him.\n\nAs he guided me through the city I received\
  \ a complimentary history lesson on the Cuban rebellion. He brought me to some of\
  \ the most iconic buildings in the city including Cuba\u2019s Parliament where he\
  \ pointed out the multiple bullet holes left behind from Fidel Castro's rebel army.\
  \ I also walked away with recommendations on where to eat and more sights to see\
  \ that would give me an authentic experience of Havana\u2019s culture.  \n\nBefore\
  \ we went our separate ways, he told me to meet him later that evening for a jam\
  \ packed night of salsa dancing, rum drinking and cigar smoking. \n\nI hesitated,\
  \ and instead went home to rejuvenate after a long day of adventures. When I was\
  \ about to call it a night, my lust for new experiences led me to continue this\
  \ serendipitous friendship with Aliz\xE9.\n\nWhen I got to our unofficial meeting\
  \ place, there wasn\u2019t a soul in sight. I began to turn around when I saw a\
  \ metal gate open and the intoxicating sound of salsa music and Cuban spirit filled\
  \ the air.\n\nI entered the courtyard, ordered a beer and when I turned around there\
  \ he was. He brought me inside to a room full of Cuban locals and we danced the\
  \ night away. \n\nAfter hours of laughs and personal salsa lessons the band packed\
  \ up, we said our farewells, and I never saw him again. \n\nSince that day I\u2019\
  ve traveled to other cities around the world, but nothing has ever measured up to\
  \ my time with Aliz\xE9 and it never would have happened if I didn\u2019t trust\
  \ that kind stranger."
