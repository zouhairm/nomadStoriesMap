Text: "The sun dipped below the horizon a long time ago, and all I can see is a brilliant\
  \ sky full of stars. I\u2019m in Joshua Tree National Park, maneuvering my rusty\
  \ Ram down a winding road. The back seats are folded down, where I\u2019ve managed\
  \ to wedge an air mattress in through the trunk. This is my first time camping alone,\
  \ and while my stomach is fluttering, I am determined to enjoy myself.\nI pull up\
  \ to the campsite, and am greeted by the warm glow of campfires, and the accompanying\
  \ chatter of campers. I am surprised to find the campsite so busy on a weekday,\
  \ but I am also reassured by the presence of others. An eclectic mixture of adventurers,\
  \ have gathered in the desert.\nIn the morning, the sun wakes me early. I unfold\
  \ myself from the cramped sleeping space, and take in a raw and beautiful landscape.\
  \ The camp is surrounded by boulder piles, and the most eager of climbers are already\
  \ scaling the rock faces. \nOut in the desert, I wander through the Joshua trees.\
  \ Eventually I find myself at the foot of a rock formation, and decide to scramble\
  \ around. In the shadows of the red stones, the air is cool and quiet. I make my\
  \ way towards the peak, sometimes taking of my sandals for better traction. When\
  \ I reach the top, with only a few scrapes and bruises, I am rewarded with a sweeping\
  \ view of the park.\nWhen I get back to my site, I meet a group of hippies, who\
  \ spend months living under the rocks. They have happily embraced a simpler way\
  \ of life, in exchange for good climbing and even better company. A young girl,\
  \ with wild dreadlocks teaches me some partner yoga. One of the boys takes me scrambling.\
  \ He is braver than I, and walks barefooted up steep, sloping boulders. That evening\
  \ we all contribute to a dinner together, which we share by the glow of the fire.\
  \ We sing songs, dance with abandon and gaze up at the stars. \nEscaping to nature\
  \ is a wonderful way to reset yourself, and remind you what is truly important in\
  \ life. I have suffered from depression for many years now, and I am in a constant\
  \ battle to try to live in the moment. Often my inner voice has held me back from\
  \ enjoying my life, and pursuing my desires. \nCamping alone was a great victory,\
  \ because it showed me what I am capable of. Now I am planning my route, so I can\
  \ take off in the car for my next trip. Living out of the car, and camping under\
  \ the stars in California has been something I have always wanted, yet somehow I\
  \ never imagined that I could do it alone."
