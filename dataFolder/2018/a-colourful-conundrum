Text: "I look at the torn train ticket in my hand and try to make sense of the scribbled\
  \ scrawl. At 120 Malawian kwacha, it's almost too good to be true for a four-hour\
  \ journey through the African wilderness. I faintly decipher the origin and destination\
  \ (Liwonde to Nayuchi) but other than the price, this faded yellow stub is a mystery\
  \ to me.\nThe piercing screech of the train's whistle announces our departure and\
  \ the carriages start their reluctant journey into the hot African sun.  \nI squeeze\
  \ my way into an overcrowded compartment, almost knocking over a cage of chickens\
  \ and 100 eyes turn on me as my poultry victims cackle and crow. I search for a\
  \ small vestige of space and smile as I see bottoms shuffling along the splintery\
  \ train pew. \nSandwiched in, I survey my surroundings. The carriage is light and\
  \ breezy and the big wide windows are drawn all the way down to help blow away the\
  \ stifling heat. My new companions are brightly dressed in all types of African\
  \ garb, and have friendly faces that put me at ease. \nMalawi's lush greenery rushes\
  \ past in a blur, and the hubbub of conversation casts a strange spell. \nThe group\
  \ immediately to my right are munching quietly on what appear to be red bananas\
  \ and, intrigued, I can't help but stare. Before too long, the closest person turns\
  \ to me, shyly, and offers a small bunch of the cardinal-coloured fruit. I shake\
  \ my head and feign gracious thank yous, but they insist. As I break one from the\
  \ cluster, I feel again the weight of 100 eyes. I look up, the chatter returns and\
  \ everyone continues with what they were doing. \nDespite its unusual appearance,\
  \ this is the best banana I've ever eaten. I lean my head back against the bumpy\
  \ carriage wall and smile. The generosity of Africa never fails to astound. \nAs\
  \ the train pulls into Nayuchi, just kilometres from the Malawi/Mozambique border,\
  \ a mother sitting across from me catches my eye. She's cradling a baby. \"Nome,\"\
  \ she implores in Portuguese. \"Nome?\" \nI realise, flatteringly, she wants me\
  \ to christen her child. I look at the little bundle, asleep and oblivious to the\
  \ world, wrapped in a faded pink blanket. She's gracefully beautiful and her peacefulness\
  \ reminds me of my mother. \"Prudence,\" I murmur, saying Mum's name aloud to the\
  \ train. \"Pru-dens,\" the mother repeats, beaming and bowing. \"Prudens.\"\nI nod,\
  \ pick up my bag and step out of the carriage and into the Nayuchi swelter. I say\
  \ a little prayer for Prudens and wonder if she will ever know that bananas also\
  \ come in yellow."
