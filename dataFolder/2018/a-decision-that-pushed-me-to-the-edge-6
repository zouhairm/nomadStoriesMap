Text: "As a kid I was fancied by \u201CAlice in Wonderland\u201D. I used to wake up\
  \ early and look out from our small window, hear the temple bell ringing, birds\
  \ chirping everything was so mesmerising and sunrise which coloured blue sky with\
  \ beautiful different colours with small deemed twinkling stars was enough to get\
  \ lost in nature\u2019s beauty and I would start dreaming like Alice. I will sit\
  \ on stars, jump on clouds. Someday I will go out of this prison. Being a girl I\
  \ was not allowed to go out except my school.\nOn way from school both sides of\
  \ that road were covered with huge trees with dark green leaves with beautiful small\
  \ yellow flowers like mandapa as if that road is welcoming me with its flowers and\
  \ cold breeze was feeling heavenly it was so beautiful.\nIn winters half my dream\
  \ feels to be true. Jumping on clouds everything in fog can\u2019t see anything\
  \ more, as if walking through clouds. I was always have a feeling whenever I see\
  \ birds flying in sky freely I should also break this cage and fly freely in my\
  \ own sky.\nBut as I grew, cage seemed too small and I was uncomfortable. I would\
  \ feel suffocated, hurting me now can\u2019t even move my wings struggled lot for\
  \ survival was very sad depressed that I can\u2019t even move myself but never lost\
  \ hope same cage which was my only world had become hell for me. If I don\u2019\
  t break this and fly I may die soon one day I managed to break that cage & took\
  \ my first flight of freedom.\nI again feel that beautiful sun rays which touch\
  \ my skin and that breeze this time it was livelier as I was not just watching and\
  \ imagining.\nI reached \u201CGod\u2019s own country\u201D and every morning was\
  \ different but satisfaction of being free is above all which made me realise of\
  \ my capabilities, strength & I can live and enjoy every bit of my life, only hope\
  \ to live this dream made me live it. On lap of Mother Nature my wounds started\
  \ healing.\nI was becoming more alive like a phoenix born from its own ashes day\
  \ by day this small bird change into a beautiful phoenix was ready to fly with its\
  \ powerful wings this was not less than any fairy-tale for a girl who was afraid\
  \ of even walking on road. New opportunities, challenges. I decided to live my dream.\
  \ That\u2019s how my new journey started. \nI enjoyed places, those backwater lakes,\
  \ beaches, weather, people, culture, festivals, & foods everything was different.\
  \ What I ever dreamed inside that cage I am living it, what can be more valuable\
  \ than freedom?\nThat cage gave me realization that DREAMS CAN BE ACHIEVED IF WE\
  \ NEVER GIVE UP."
