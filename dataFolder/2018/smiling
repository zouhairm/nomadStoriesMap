Text: "I walked around the market with Tharanga.  I picked up some fabric with an\
  \ elephant print and put it on my body.  \u201C A sarong,\u201D I said. She laughed.\
  \ She asked me if I had met the Queen. I smiled and said I had not, but I liked\
  \ her. She asked about my family and when I would marry.  I said I had not decided\
  \ yet. I asked her about her life. She had no children but wanted them. She would\
  \ like to move away but did not know how. She mentioned that her brother ran an\
  \ activity camp in the hills, camping at night by the fire, and asked would I be\
  \ interested in going tomorrow. Without thinking, I said yes. On a piece of paper,\
  \ she wrote her number.\n    \n Tharanga waited under the Buddha\u2019s head. A\
  \ smile beamed from her face. \u201CAyuboyen,\u201D I said, with my hands together.\
  \ \u201CAyuboyen\u201D she replied. \u201CYou wore it then?\u201D She asked, looking\
  \ at the elephant sarong. \u201CYes, I could not resist.\u201D She flagged a tuk-tuk.\
  \ Jumping in, I followed. She asked about London and big ben.  I told her I had\
  \ been and it was not as big as she may think. I asked her about the north of the\
  \ Island. She told me of tea plantations, surfing beaches, and a vast mountain.\
  \ I wanted to see it all I told her. She would take me she said.\n\nThe journey\
  \ took high into the hills. On the edge of the road it went. Tharanga talked of\
  \ the past, of her childhood, where she went to an all-girls school. I told her\
  \ about my mixed school. She was intrigued. We arrived. Greetings came from her\
  \ brother. Shaking hands and speaking of words. We played cards. Tharanga was a\
  \ quick learner. She won. Tharanga's brother handed us curry. We ate. \n\nIn the\
  \ afternoon we went climbing, running up the hill. Tharanga fell. I held out my\
  \ hand. She took it. She thanked me. She asked about home. I told her about the\
  \ fields with sheep in, about the hills and my friends.  She talked about India.\
  \  She wanted to see more of the world.  I wanted to see more the world.\n\nTharanga\u2019\
  s brother led us up a wooden tower. I volunteered to go first on the zip wire first.\
  \ It was woohoo exhilarating.  Tharanga went second. She screamed as she entered\
  \ the water. Afterwards, we walked through the mud with bare feet.  \u201CThere\
  \ could be snakes in here,\u201D I said. \u201CUnlikely, but let\u2019s get back.\u201D\
  \ We ran. \n\nNight time came.  Food was cooking on the fire. We drank. We talked.\
  \ Tharanga looked up at the stars, so did I. \"It is amazing, so clear. Look, there\
  \ that is Orion\u2019s belt and there...\" I said.  She listened. She questioned.\
  \ I heard. I asked. Sleep came."
