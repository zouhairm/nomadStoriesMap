Text: "Drifting. Taxi, bus, wait, bus, boat, dinghy, boat.\nWe rock, it creaks. Two\
  \ men shouting, one spanner twisting. I stand, we tilt. I eye up the shore. We\u2019\
  re not far but getting no closer. \nTwo, maybe, three hours now we wait. One more\
  \ shout and a phone call. Another one comes. It plods closer to us, as unassured\
  \ of itself as I am of myself. A diesel plume chases behind it, the only cloud above\
  \ the bay.\nI\u2019m not steady as I bridge the gap. The bag\u2019s propping my\
  \ neck, the cap\u2019s blocking some of the sun. I try to rest, the day\u2019s been\
  \ long.\nI step off into knee-deep water and ankle high coral. My bag follows. The\
  \ straps taste the water and graze along the rock. I sidestep towards floating mattresses\
  \ and white sand. \nThe bag\u2019s down again, I am too. It\u2019s a small hut,\
  \ a big group. The heat gets trapped in here with me, I need air. \nThere\u2019\
  s hammocks out here, and some palms. I learn to relax. It\u2019s getting darker.\
  \ They\u2019re out for a swim and call for me. It really is dark now. \nI take small\
  \ steps. I go past my knees, my waist, my chest. They\u2019re still far. I look\
  \ around me and there\u2019s a glow in the water. It\u2019s plankton I think. When\
  \ i move they cling to me. I lean back to face the sky and close my eyes.\nI let\
  \ myself fall. The noise is silenced and I float. My eyes open but all I can see\
  \ is a foggy glow.I can\u2019t hear a thing but it\u2019s ok. I\u2019m ok."
