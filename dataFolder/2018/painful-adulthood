Text: "The last thing I expected\n\nHow a good memorable childhood turned into painful\
  \ adulthood.\n\nGrowing up with both parents and four siblings, myself being the\
  \ last born, the fifth. What every kid expects is what I expected growing up, being\
  \ placed in a warm environment with love and stability surrounding me.  I noticed\
  \ nothing when I was a kid but what I expected was for my family to be always around\
  \ each other when the sun was about to set, sharing jokes, tell each other how our\
  \ days have been, sharing a meal and just having one of those sessions whereby we\
  \ spend hours bonding and laughing. \n\nHeartbreak started when I was only 13 on\
  \ 2001 and I was doing grade 7. It was month end for heaven\u2019s sake and normally\
  \ my father buys me gifts when he gets paid but something strange occurred that\
  \ day. He never came home, the fear I had when I slept without him. I woke up early\
  \ hours of the next morning and I rushed to my parents room to check if is he next\
  \ to my mother but his bedside was empty. I got revolted when I found my mother\
  \ crying in the dark, I switched off the light and asked her what was wrong with\
  \ a shaking voice. She then said nothing but I asked her why is she crying is its\
  \ nothing, I told her that I am not that 6 years old boy that she used to protect\
  \ from the truth.\n\n I made sure that she knew that I\u2019m a teenager and I can\
  \ handle myself, I mean it was a matter of three months before I get into high school.\
  \ We then had a long chat about life and its challenges. My father entered in few\
  \ hours later but it was still in the morning he was so drunk that he could not\
  \ walk on his own. Few steps into the house he fell and vomited.\n \nI had to adjust\
  \ to the fact that now my father was an alcoholic, my life took a different turn.\
  \ I couldn\u2019t concentrate at school as he used to come home every night drunk\
  \ and shouts everyone telling them their \u201Csecrets\u201D. In grade 10 I had\
  \ to go for counselling at school because what was happening in my house had somehow\
  \ had its impact on my studies, negative one.  My father was already on child support\
  \ because he had failed to provide for us as family and kids on his own.\n\nTwo\
  \ years ago, my mother had slapped my father with divorce papers, I couldn\u2019\
  t allow my family to be divided so I then mediated and said cant they at least be\
  \ in separation as that will give them a chance to try and give it another go or\
  \ to at least think through. The last thing I expected was for my parents to be\
  \ in separation given the upbringing they gave me."
