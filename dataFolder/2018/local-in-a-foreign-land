Text: "One hour after the landing and my tongue was already on fire - it was true,\
  \ what I heard a thousand times before was true: the original food of this country\
  \ is very spicy but still delicious.\n\nI could smell, as the waiter who was dressed\
  \ up with typical Mexican costumes was getting closer with my bite, how real spiciness\
  \ smells and see the colors that reminded me of the lustiness of the sun that shines\
  \ over my homeland. And I could feel, helped by this Mexican lady, a friend of mine,\
  \ who was telling me we were nearby the Zocalo, the main square of the city where\
  \ the representative monument of the foundation of Mexico is, the passion and traditions\
  \ of a country in one meal.\n\n\u201CLet\u2019s go, there's too much to see\u201D\
  \ came out of her mouth right after we finished.\n\u201CTrece pesos, a trece pesos\
  \ los refrescos\u201D I heard, when going out of the subway station. It was like\
  \ walking in the streets of San Jos\xE9, Costa Rica but surrounded by much bigger\
  \ buildings and people using curious, different words for referring to things I\
  \ perfectly knew but never thought somebody could call like that, what made me think\
  \ of how different a language can be from one place where it is spoken to another\
  \ and feel enthralled by it.\n\nIt was a sunny Saturday, they day of the week that\
  \ seemed to be the pedlar\u2019s favourite one - hundreds of them in the streets,\
  \ selling candies, tacos, sunglasses, hats. \u201CI think I will need a pair of\
  \ sunglasses\u201D I thought, \u201CWhy not?\u201D, just before finding myself being\
  \ captivated by the story of how the city started to be officially called Mexico\
  \ City instead of Federal District, narrated by the same man who was selling me\
  \ the product - something so simple but fascinating at the same time. I was really\
  \ enjoying the city, but now it was its people what was delighting me. It was like\
  \ discovering my deepest origins, being home.\n\nAnd there was me, first in Casa\
  \ de los Azulejos and the Latin American Tower and a few hours later in the Metropolitan\
  \ Cathedral and some other small churches, built out of gray, tessellated walls,\
  \ that were so quiet even though they are in one of the biggest cities in the world\
  \ and millions of people were passing by outside the walls. And there was me, who\
  \ thought he was abroad but was still a local; and there was me, with a sense of\
  \ belonging to the places and feeling proud of my roots and the history this land\
  \ holds and grateful of having the bliss of getting to know, a little more, the\
  \ beauty of Latin America."
