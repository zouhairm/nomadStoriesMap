Text: "The time somewhere in the first semester of 2017, the place Guido\u2019s. Both\
  \ of us had been working for about a year and had some money on the side. She was\
  \ living alone already and in the matters of the heart, we were both quite hurt\
  \ and disappointed with what life had thrown at us and needed a break, needed to\
  \ breathe. \nAnd so, that day, over two dispirited cigarettes it was an easy call,\
  \ we were getting away that summer. The mood was immediately shaken and the decisions\
  \ taken: Somewhere beautiful, with a rich culture, but most importantly warm and\
  \ not very expensive. Croatia. After some preferences put on the table, we decided\
  \ we were the priority. No strict plans or defined routes. We're going to decide\
  \ the next destination day by day, according to our will and vibrations of each\
  \ place. To sleep the haven of kind couchsurfers or youth hostels. It was no longer\
  \ only a trip to get away, it had become a challenge, an adventure. \nIn the beginning,\
  \ we spent a full day at Plitvice Lakes National Park, one of many in Croatia. And\
  \ was it memorable. A wooden walkway extended throughout the park revealing green\
  \ lagoons, majestic waterfalls, high fragrant clearings. The only downside was it\
  \ was forbidden to go in the water. No problem there though as the other scents\
  \ were mesmerized.\nFrom there, Zadar. The sunset in that wide bay with a hectic\
  \ sea to lose sight of and to enchant that unique marvellous sea organ. Unparalleled.\
  \ \nWe then continued to descend the Croatian coast, and there is something rather\
  \ substantial we've learnt about it: The quiet places are the best. The little town\
  \ of Supetar was a breath of fresh air without those masses of red robotic lobsters\
  \ that populated the big centres like Split. Instead humble stone houses, an aged\
  \ hearty population and about every black cat in the world. Another pearl of wisdom\
  \ is about the beaches over there: Overall scary, as they are not white sandy beaches\
  \ but instead, one has to climb high cliffs and find a way through stony paths,\
  \ but it's all worth it to reach that warm but refreshing, soft and envolving embrace\
  \ of the nectar they call water.\nThese experiences solidified our friendship like\
  \ nothing before and revealed, one at a time, a depth in us, a feeling of freedom\
  \ and love for the world and all it has to offer and are now part of us. It feels\
  \ a little like a polaroid picture that represents so much in so little space, that\
  \ we can only carry it at all times. And we didn't need much money to take it."
