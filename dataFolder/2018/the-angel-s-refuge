Text: "On my way to the north of Chile, I took some time to pause in La Serena; the\
  \ city of the golden papayas. After taking a two hour bone jarring bus ride through\
  \ the spectacular curvature of the Valle d\u2019Elqui, the diminishing light was\
  \ bathing the mountains in a vermilion glow. I had no place to sleep in my final\
  \ destination of Pisco Elqui, but I had befriended a young Argentine man named Maxim\
  \ on the bus and decided to stay with him for the night. Although it seems naive,\
  \ I never suspected any malicious intentions. After finding the tranquility of El\
  \ Refugio del Angel, we pitched his two man tent there and began cooking tortelloni\
  \ on a small butane stove.  \n\u201CCompramos algunas cervesas?\u201D suggested\
  \ Maxim.\nWe bought eight beers in total, and I thoroughly enjoyed sampling the\
  \ locally brewed hoppy pale ale. Back at the campsite, there was no artificial light\
  \ and a pair of reclining wooden chairs were perched at the water\u2019s edge, as\
  \ if they\u2019d been expecting us. The skies in the Valle d\u2019Elqui are amongst\
  \ the clearest on the planet and with no local light pollution, we had a veritable\
  \ banquet of stars scattered over the obsidian sky. With the constellations out\
  \ in full force, we conversed in fractured English and Spanish for a few hours with\
  \ our eight empty bottles. \nEventually, I sauntered off to the toilet block to\
  \ brush my teeth. Then, almost imperceptibly, a violent wave of nausea struck me\
  \ and I hurled myself into a cubicle to throw up. At first I blamed the alcohol,\
  \ but it would not subside. After an hour and a half of incessant vomiting had passed,\
  \ I heard a concerned voice from outside,\n\u201CCassie?  Estas bien?\u201D\nMaxim\
  \ had clearly realised that something was amidst and had located the nearest medical\
  \ centre and brought me a gallon of water, which I sipped pitifully, slouched against\
  \ the door in my soiled clothes. When I emerged he insisted that we venture to the\
  \ medical centre, although it was approaching 5am now. The 400 metre walk seemed\
  \ like a tropical marathon in a sumo suit, but to my elation we arrived in one piece.\n\
  Maxim stayed for the entire 7 hour ordeal. The next day we took a very light walk\
  \ around the picturesque village and bought innumerable glasses of fruit juice,\
  \ none of which I could keep down. I had a 17 hour bus journey ahead of me to San\
  \ Pedro de Atacama, which filled me with dread. However, as I shuffled on to the\
  \ last bus back towards La Serena that evening, I felt an immense sense of gratitude\
  \ for a perfect stranger's unexpected altruism."
