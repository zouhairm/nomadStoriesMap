Text: "Crazy in the morning\nSpirited in the afternoon\nCalm at sunset\nSleepy by\
  \ night\n\nAs the window changes scenery\nHer mind changes moods\nBeaches to hills\
  \ to wildlife\nHer mind is rough, sunny, hot\nThen cool, chilly, frozen\nAnd then\
  \ it pours!\n\nShe goes upstream, then downstream\nWith the current, against the\
  \ current\nDrifting, drowning\nEbbing, receding\n\nThe high tides of her mind are\
  \ dangerous\nShe dresses, undresses, over dresses\nAnd then she walks in her night\
  \ gown\n\nSlow like the elephants of Pinnawale elephant orphanage\nHelpless like\
  \ the albino turtle of Kosgoda turtle hatchery\nMischievous like the squirrel that\
  \ loves fries in Mirissa beach\nIndomitable like the blue whales of Mirissa; blowing\
  \ air\nShe needs to come to the surface to breathe  just like those whales\n\nShe\
  \ is deep like the oceans of Hikkaduwa\nViolent like the waves of Kogolla\nAnd then\
  \ blue like the beaches of Bentota\n\nSmashing like the mighty Devon waterfalls\n\
  Transient like the tea leaves of Nuwara Eliya;\nMorose like the noise of the car\
  \ engine on the south Srilankan highway\nBlushing pink like the magnificent sunset\n\
  Stubborn as the rock of Sigiriya\nCalm as the Buddha statues in every street corner\n\
  High maintenance like the precious gem stones \nOld world and arty like Galle's\
  \ dutch lanes\nAttention-seeking like the cat in Negombo\n\nShe is Sri Lanka\nLanka\
  \ is a mirror\nSri Lanka is a million emotions that converge\nLike a tear drop in\
  \ the Indian Ocean"
