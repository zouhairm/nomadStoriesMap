Text: "The heat of the Indian sun bore down onto our pale, foreign skin. Dust wrapped\
  \ itself around our ankles as we rambled on. The occasional cow crossed our path\
  \ from time to time, but humans were scarce. We were well and truly lost. Jaipur\u2019\
  s old town had swallowed us up and wherever we were by now was a ghost town.\nI\
  \ quite enjoyed this part of travelling. Who knows what we might find? More cows,\
  \ apparently. We stopped for a rest, guessing which way might lead us back to civilisation.\
  \ None of us were known for our navigational skills. We could be going round in\
  \ circles for all we knew. \nThen, in the distance \u2013 a sound. As we drew closer\
  \ \u2013 music! We followed our ears to an old, seemingly abandoned building with\
  \ Bollywood music flowing out of its windows. To our surprise, we saw a dance class\
  \ of young girls in full swing and we watched for a few moments in awe. That\u2019\
  s all we had until we were spotted.\nAs one girl noticed us, her face transformed\
  \ into a huge beam of a smile and she pointed at us to her friend. One by one, each\
  \ girl in the class became distracted and they soon formed a little crowd, smiling\
  \ and waving at us excitedly from the door. The teacher came over to see what all\
  \ the fuss was about, then gave us a welcoming smile and beckoned us in. At the\
  \ gesture, the entire class were at the gate in a flurry, holding our hands and\
  \ leading us in to join them. Not that we had much of a choice in the matter, but\
  \ we were just as delighted as they were.\nWe kicked off our shoes and freed our\
  \ aching soles to patter along the floor beside them. The music played on in an\
  \ upbeat rhythm, speaking to our bodies to dance. Standing as mirror images to us,\
  \ the girls' hands twirled, heads wobbled, shoulders bopped, hips swayed, feet pivoted...\
  \ We tried our best to keep up as they moved their entire bodies with ease and elegance\
  \ to the chirpy tune, but it appeared that our dance skills weren\u2019t quite up\
  \ to scratch. They giggled at our left-footed attempts, encouraging us to carry\
  \ on. We were left breathless and rejuvenated, laughter having lifted our spirits.\
  \  \nHugs were given all round and they waved us to the end of the road as we left\
  \ (bumping almost immediately into another cow). I may have had a happy tear or\
  \ two in my eye. It had been the single most heart-warming experience of my life.\
  \ I now felt connected to India in a way I hadn\u2019t before, like we had been\
  \ beautifully initiated into the culture. If anywhere ran on love alone, it was\
  \ this place."
