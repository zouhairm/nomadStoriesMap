Text: "As the man selling me the motorbike searches for change, I attempt to make\
  \ small talk. \"So, do you like living here?\". I hear a laugh as his head pops\
  \ up from under his desk and he cheerfully responds, \"Great, it's the Las Vegas\
  \ of The Philippines\". His raspy laugh and gap-toothed smile don't seem to convey\
  \ any sarcasm so I nod politely.  \n \nRoughly 4 nanoseconds pass between the moment\
  \ I receive my keys and the instant my hand cranks the throttle. Finally I'm on\
  \ my way out of Angeles City. Away from hotels that charge per hour, not per night.\
  \ Away from its neon propositions. Onward to the coast.\n \nThe highways are packed\
  \ with maniac bus drivers and constant congestion. However, with my trusty GPS at\
  \ hand I\u2019m feeling confident that I\u2019ll be able to navigate my way over\
  \ the smaller roads that crisscross the countryside.\n\nMy tires skid across the\
  \ sandy road as I swerve to avoid kiddie pool-sized potholes. I overcompensate and\
  \ turn sharply. The bike lurches to a halt as the front end is swallowed by one\
  \ of the craters. \n\nAs I slowly gather my faculties, I look to my left and all\
  \ I see are piles of multicolored junk so vast and innumerable that their only discernible\
  \ end is the line on the horizon.\n\nThe smell of burnt plastic and decomposing\
  \ waste assaults my nostrils. In my stench-induced stupor, I\u2019m almost oblivious\
  \ to the young man now standing behind me. \u201CHi\u201D, he says in a gentle and\
  \ curious tone. Behind him is a family huddled tightly under a tattered cloth awning\
  \ secured to a barbed wire fence.  \n\nThe young man introduces himself as Vergel.\
  \ Standing closer now, I notice his slender frame is outlined by a flowery blouse,\
  \ navy striped pants, cowboy boots, and a baseball cap. He introduces me to his\
  \ mother and 6 siblings, all of whom are huddled tightly on the ground playing a\
  \ board game. They go back to playing and I chat with Vergel. He tells me that his\
  \ family lives here, earning money from selling scrap metal and other discarded\
  \ goods.  \n\n\u201CYou lost? Need water?\u201D He seems genuinely concerned for\
  \ my well-being. When I tell him about the motorbike he immediately runs and grabs\
  \ his brothers who hoist the bike on all sides and easily pluck it from the crater.\n\
  \nReaching into my pocket, I pull out what few wadded bills I have.  Before I can\
  \ extend my hand, Vergel smiles and declines by politely shaking his head.  \n\n\
  In a place where one man's trash is another man's home, the last thing I expected\
  \ to find was a junkyard full of people with hearts of gold."
