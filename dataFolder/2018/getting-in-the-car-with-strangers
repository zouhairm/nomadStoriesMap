Text: "The car stops next to us, while we are walking in the direction of the white\
  \ cliffs on the island of M\xF8n in Denmark. The typical cold Danish November rain\
  \ has been drizzling for the last couple of hours, it is already dark, and the cliffs\
  \ are still some 20 kilometers away, so we pick up the pace. By this time we have\
  \ lost all hope of getting a ride. \n\nAt that moment I resemble a stereotypical\
  \ Eastern European girl (which I actually am) - pink jacket and desperate look in\
  \ my eyes. My travelling partner Peter is a Danish boxer with bright red hair and\
  \ intimidatingly broad shoulders. These features along with our dripping-wet clothes\
  \ do not look appealing to the passerby drivers. But then this car stops and a woman\
  \ in a passenger seat scrolls her window down. \n\n\"You are the first person, who\
  \ smiled at me today.\" - she says. I then remember: some 15 minutes earlier, when\
  \ Peter went to ask for directions into the gas station, I was waiting for him outside.\
  \ I have this habit of smiling to strangers for no reason. - \"We went half of our\
  \ way home, but kept worrying why you two were walking towards the cliffs at night.\"\
  \ \n\nMy Danish is not that good, but Peter loves telling that story. About a quiet\
  \ girl who came from Eastern Europe to stay in a Danish boarding school and seemed\
  \ afraid of her own shadow. And about himself, the main school hooligan, who out\
  \ of boredom challenged the classmates to go on a hitch-hike on a November weekend\
  \ through all Denmark from Aarhus to the Cliffs of M\xF8n. And how she surprised\
  \ everyone and mostly herself with being the only one who said yes. \n\n\"Get in\
  \ the car\" - commands Sara and we obey. Behind the wheel there is a middle-aged\
  \ dangerously looking man: at least his shoulders are broader than Peter's. Yunus\
  \ tells us about his journey to Denmark from Afghanistan, losing his family and\
  \ his plans of building a rehab for the local drug-addicts. Sara looks at us with\
  \ compassion and remarks that she has the need to look after someone, since her\
  \ sons were taken away from her by the authorities.\n\nTheir house stands on a hill\
  \ in the middle of the orchard. When we arrive, it is already past midnight and\
  \ the rain has stopped. The night sky melts into the sea, so as I walk, I see the\
  \ stars not only above my head, but all around me. Sara takes me by the hand and\
  \ walks me around the garden, telling me the names of each naked tree in Danish.\
  \ She touches the branch and laughs when the drops fall on us."
