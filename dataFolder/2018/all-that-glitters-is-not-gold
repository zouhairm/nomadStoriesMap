Text: "\u201CI am taking the next car that comes along, my knee hurts\u201D I told\
  \ Carlos. We had been walking for ages, the road to Monsoon Palace seemed endless.\
  \ The plan was to see the sunset over Udaipur, but the sun was already low in the\
  \ sky and the summit was still a speck in the distance. I wasn\u2019t sure we\u2019\
  d make it in time. Today is Dhanteras, a day for worshiping the goddess of wealth.\
  \ Traditionally people buy gold on this day. My day was enriched not by the purchase\
  \ of gold but by the chance encounter of  friendly strangers and the wonders of\
  \ the natural world. Dhanteras is part of the preparation for Divali, one of the\
  \ biggest festivals here in India. We saw women paint the entrance to their shops\
  \ and homes with red paint and place candles and flowers in the doorways. Every\
  \ now and again a bang would go off making me jump out of my skin. It\u2019s tradition\
  \ to set off fireworks over this period and it\u2019s not uncommon to see young\
  \ children playing with fireworks in the street. Don\u2019t tell the Health and\
  \ Safety police, they\u2019d have a field day here. Carlos and I had spent the day\
  \ exploring. The heat was stifling and the narrow streets crammed with people did\
  \ little to help keep us cool. The small shops overflowed, their wares spilling\
  \ out on the road. Tuktuk horns blared as they fought for space and motorbikes veered\
  \ left and right trying to avoid the children playing. It was colourful and chaotic.\
  \ We past shop after shop selling bright coloured clothes I\u2019m so tempted to\
  \ fill my rucksack, it\u2019s already too heavy though, maybe one Kurta (an Indian\
  \ top) wouldn\u2019t hurt. Amidst the melee, a sanctuary: Shree Jagdesh. A beautiful\
  \ temple which looked Inca made with its intricately carved exterior. I sat inside\
  \ cooled by the fans, listening to an older Indian lady sing a prayer. Soporific.\
  \ The road wound up and up, would we make it in time to see the sunset, at this\
  \ rate, I doubted it. We had been walking a while when the car pulled up. \u2018\
  Do you want a lift?\u2019 came a friendly voice. There were exactly two spare seats\
  \ in the car, what luck. Perhaps we would see the sun go down after all. The leather\
  \ seats and air conditioning were a welcome relief. The last few kilometers to Monsoon\
  \ Palace were a delight. What did I learn, as the sun dipped behind the hill spreading\
  \ its golden glow on all it touched, illuminating the beauty of the faces of the\
  \ strangers sat beside me on the wall, bathed in light? True wealth lies not in\
  \ gold but in the beauty of nature, and the kindness of a stranger."
