Text: "Seeing through his eyes\nEndless roads and summer skies\nA wanderer life\n\n\
  You never know where a travel might take you, you plan it before you take the plane,\
  \ but a journey has its own life. \nAs far back as my memory goes, my heart always\
  \ yearned for other lands, the kid I was waited patiently for years to pass, until\
  \ the day I could start wandering around the globe. \n\nMy first road trip took\
  \ place between Chicago and New York.  There is something about american roads that\
  \ makes all young minds dream, and I'm like everybody. \nEvery few days a new town,\
  \ the main road was outlined but for the stops I was pursuing only my inclination.\
  \ Taking a path because a tree was beautiful or because the sun was illuminating\
  \ the road with an attractive light.\nIn each city I went trough, I made a habit\
  \ of going to the local fast food, early in the morning it was the meeting point\
  \ of the elders around newspapers and hot coffee cups. From afar I became a spectator\
  \ of people's daily routine. \n\nThis day, for the first time, somebody came to\
  \ me. I had seen him coming in, the days before, with his walker, going slowly to\
  \ the same table. This time instead he came to my table\n'Can I?'\nIn a small town\
  \ a stranger is easily spotted, he explained. He proudly announced that to his knowledge\
  \ I was the first french to visit his township.\nHis ivory white beard and walker\
  \ were totally wiped away by the youth in his eyes. The word road trip had woken\
  \ up old memories of wandering, along the americans highways, riding on the back\
  \ of his fierce Harley Davidson. He talked about 'her' with sparkles in his bright\
  \ eyes, describing the way she roared when he was guiding her on their endless journey.\
  \ Sliding on the asphalt, riding his steel horse like a modern time cowboy. \nHe\
  \ showed me each tattoo carved on his parchment skin, tributes to all the memorable\
  \ instants he lived. \nHis voice full of emotions as he described me one cold night\
  \ in the desert, the long hours, the deceleration of time, and at the end the long\
  \ awaited reward, rising at the horizon in his colorful coat, the most wonderful\
  \ sunset he ever witnessed, etched in his mind until his dying breath. \nI let him\
  \ took me from one memory to another without saying a word. Each one so vivid, the\
  \ scenes unrolled before my imagination, I was carried away, sharing his emotions.\n\
  \nAs I left, coffee in hand, I knew I had find what I was expecting from travels\
  \ without knowing it, meeting souls, living through their eyes, sharing what warms\
  \ their heart."
