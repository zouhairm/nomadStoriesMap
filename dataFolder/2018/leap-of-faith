Text: "Standing on the edge of the precipice looking down, I catch my breath. The\
  \ drop is unexpected, as rocky crevices and lush green foliage lead my eyes inexorably\
  \ to the bottom. Way down.\nCanyoning in Wanaka, NZ, is not the quiet bushwalk through\
  \ scenic gorges I had pictured when my friend invited me. This is a wild stream\
  \ cutting through a mountain in the Southern Alps, and the only way down is over\
  \ this edge... \nI'm fetchingly dressed in a borrowed wetsuit, borrowed oversized\
  \ shoes and a borrowed helmet, which all add to my general discomfort. Grimacing,\
  \ I turn my back to the chasm. The rope is between my quaking hands, and even though\
  \ I know I'm tethered to numerous safety lines by locking carabiners, my heart leaps\
  \ into my mouth as I hop clumsily over the edge.\nHoppity hop! There is nothing\
  \ graceful about my descent, just a lot of clumsy push-outs and returns. Reaching\
  \ the bottom, I unhook and await further instructions from a trained guide bemused\
  \ by my lack of finesse. I try to shrug off her disapproval by scrambling doggedly\
  \ up a seemingly sheer curve of rock that thrusts above our heads. We shimmy to\
  \ the edge, then one by one launch ourselves into the torrent.\nDown we go- sometimes\
  \ headfirst, sometimes feet first with limbs akimbo, sliding, slipping further down\
  \ the waterfall's downward trajectory. I splash feet-first into a rock pool cave.\
  \ Sparkling droplets of water bedazzle my eyes, tricking me into believing, for\
  \ a moment, that I have stumbled into a fairy dell.\nLooking up, I catch my breath.\
  \ Like delicate jewels released from a necklace, the water cascades down the rocky\
  \ ledges, shafts of light cutting through in rainbows. I pause and breathe for a\
  \ moment, transfixed by its impossible beauty, my bulky ensemble suddenly incongruous.\n\
  We continue down, four mismatched women thrust into nature's coquettish dance of\
  \ elements. Pausing briefly under a thunderous deluge, we joyously embrace the moment,\
  \ laughing uproariously at the pounding backrub that works us harder than a shiatsu\
  \ massage.\nAs I descend, I ease into the ebb and flow of the water- all the stumbling,\
  \ the clumsy sliding and the awkward splashing eventually smooth my ruffles... and\
  \ I begin to enjoy myself. Then, in a climactic act of surrender, I plunge feet\
  \ first down the waterfall to finish the trip, arms and legs splayed, like a slightly\
  \ waterlogged and bewildered goddess giving birth to the river."
