Text: "I started my Camino with the unconsciousness and bravery which usually drive\
  \ each pilgrim through that way, plus of recklessness because I wasn\u2019t properly\
  \ trained, especially for the \u201CMesetas\u201D, the so-called part of Santiago\u2019\
  s French Way from Burgos to Le\xF2n. You can believe me, there\u2019s a reason why\
  \ it\u2019s the least travelled part of the Camino. \nMy friend and I started walking\
  \ early in the morning to avoid the warmest hours of a classical summer season in\
  \ the central part of Spain, everything has gone well for the first couple of hours,\
  \ then the sun dawned and started burning, while the landscape became less and less\
  \ shady and verdant. By noon we were really strained by the dry hot weather and\
  \ surrounded by a bleak and burned landscape, making us feeling lost in the desert\
  \ like in a western movie. My friend started having a problem with her knee, while\
  \ my feet were burning and exploding in my shoes: I discovered with terror that\
  \ my shoes were completely wrong; how could we continue walking for the rest of\
  \ the journey? \nLuckily, we arrived in a not-so-little village, with an emergency\
  \ room where my friend has been visited for her knee pain, and me for my suffering\
  \ feet. After that we tried to find a sports shop to buy new and comfortable trekking\
  \ shoes for my poor feet, but unfortunately the only suitable pair of shoes were\
  \ sandals and the worst thing for me was that I had to wear them with trekking socks!\
  \ I don\u2019t know much about trekking equipment and I was conscious that I wasn\u2019\
  t there for a fashion week show but, my dear, sandals with socks for me were and\
  \ still are one of the worst existing combinations that a mind can conceive! \n\
  Both saddened by setbacks of day one, we stopped in the local hostel; while we meditated\
  \ whether to continue or not, in the next room we heard a couple of gentlemen complaining\
  \ in our mother tongue and we all started chatting about our misadventures: they\
  \ were expert and sporty walker, but they had their feet injured by the walking,\
  \ too. Despite that, they didn\u2019t want to stop because they made a promise:\
  \ to go all the way to Santiago, as a thanksgiving for having survived with their\
  \ families from the earthquake that hit their area few months before.\nAshamed of\
  \ our lack of tenacity, we decided to continue the journey to the end with them.\
  \ We went through many difficult moments that followed, continuing supporting each\
  \ other, and finally we\u2019ve been rewarded by the happiness of having arrived\
  \ in Santiago, keeping the promise made."
