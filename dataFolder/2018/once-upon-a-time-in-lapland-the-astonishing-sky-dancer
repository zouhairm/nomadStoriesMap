Text: "\u201CGuess what! Today is the day!\u201D said L\xE9on, that day at the Arktikum\
  \ house in Rovaniemi. We looked at each other and the tips of our lips almost reached\
  \ our ears. \n\nDuring the evening, we and many other Erasmus students headed all\
  \ together to the \u201COunasvaara\u201D hill. We were waiting at the same spot\
  \ about an hour without any luck. I started thinking it was over. Until we saw some\
  \ kind of clouds. What we didn\u2019t realise immediately was that these clouds\
  \ were actually the Northern Lights. This is one of the reasons why one must visit\
  \ the Arctic Circle.\n\nI finally met Aurora Borealis and it was moving with grace\
  \ like a majestic lady. I was watching it with awe as it was getting closer and\
  \ spreading around creating an unsteady circle. I gasped. The green dance in the\
  \ sky, constantly changing shapes, made us cheer. I couldn\u2019t believe in my\
  \ eyes. One can never be sure about the time that this magic appears or if it will\
  \ appear at all. Polar lights were moving all over the sky and we were witnessing\
  \ a thrilling phenomenon.  \n\nI stepped a few meters to the other side, looked\
  \ up, warm tears were overcoming my cheeks. It was a moment of connecting my soul\
  \ with nature.  Then, something went beyond my rational limits. I didn\u2019t expect\
  \ that a natural light display on the Earth's sky would be the stepping stone to\
  \ release a part of my distress. I was afraid of being exposed, but Aurora was healing.\
  \ The voices of my surrounding brought me back to the present moment. Laughter and\
  \ amused people were standing and dancing on the soft ground. \n\nAfter my friend\
  \ took a few photos of the Northern Lights, we saw the real colours of that dancer.\
  \ Green was the visible to us colour, but not the only colour existing at that moment.\
  \ The photos that L\xE9on took with his professional camera left us speechless.\
  \ We saw green, blue, pink, purple. All these colours! We laid on the white hill\
  \ and continued gazing the swaying colourful sky dancer. That night was worth every\
  \ tear, every struggle of feeling alone away from home. In fact, I realised I wasn\u2019\
  t alone, but was learning through a process, a choice I made and a promise I gave\
  \ to myself.\n\nI consider it as a blessing, not only meeting the Finnish culture\
  \ but also seeing and living among a lot of people with different origins from all\
  \ over the world. I made friends, celebrated Easter twice, talked with people in\
  \ my second mother tongue, I also tried to learn Finnish, I have shared moments\
  \ and experiences. I was suddenly getting over my fears."
