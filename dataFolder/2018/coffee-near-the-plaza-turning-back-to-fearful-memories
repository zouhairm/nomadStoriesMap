Text: "It's 5 pm in downtown Buenas Aires, a gathering time of day. Baristas liberate\
  \ shuttered windows. Customers lean through doors to hail friends inside. Venga!\
  \ The coffee smells tempt me too, as it did 30 years ago when I drank a daily ritual\
  \ cup. \n\nBut I have just 24 hours to revisit B.A. I cannot stop, yet. I am relying\
  \ on my memory to guide me to the Plaza Rosada, the site of Argentina\u2019s government.\
  \ I want to see a HEALED Plaza de Mayo, AFTER the \u201CDirty Wars.\u201D \n\nIn\
  \ 1975 I was here, young and unaware of the riptide of changes and dangers blowing\
  \ into Argentina. Isabel Peron was president, but not for long. The army would sneak\
  \ to the North in Tucuman, to kidnap more than 10,000 political dissidents. In the\
  \ capital, rumors circulated about the missing; the inflation rate rose to 300%.\
  \ Locals scrambled for U.S.dollars to hedge against hard times even though doing\
  \ so risked jail or worse. \n\nAs I walk on towards the plaza, a memory shadows\
  \ me like a dirty footprint. I hear a whisper \u201CYou know this place.\u201D I\
  \ stop, turn around, and go back to the coffee shop I passed earlier. Could it be\
  \ that this IS the coffee shop in 1975 where I met a stranger to trade money? I\
  \ steady myself on the shop\u2019s wall and scan the interior. My fearful memories\
  \ resurface. Its as though my battered travel journal falls open to the headline\
  \ \u201Cfools exchange money on the black market.\u201D \n\nI had been traveling\
  \ for over a year. My dollars were thin. An Argentine friend arranged the exchange\
  \ through her mother who had escaped  WWII Germany and knew what hardships a regime\
  \ change and inflation could bring.\n\nI arrived at the coffee shop as instructed.\
  \ Would my contact look desperate or nervous? Neither. A dignified man in a dark\
  \ suit stepped to the table.  In a hushed voice, he said he was the friend of Inge\u2019\
  s mother. After what I hoped appeared to be casual talk, I passed my final dollars\
  \ to him. He promptly stood up, excused himself and walked out of the door. \n\n\
  Maybe he said wait (Espera), but I don't recall any reassurance that he would return.\
  \ I know I held my breath as he walked away.  Was he going to come back? Was he\
  \ signaling the police to arrest me? The risk of calling attention to myself kept\
  \ me in my seat in stunned silence.\n\nI recall my wide-eyed relief when he did\
  \ return with the money. \n\nToday, my eyes turn back to the street. I take a cleansing\
  \ breath and let my memory NOW lead me to the plaza, away from reminders of the\
  \ Dirty War."
