Text: "\u201COne day I\u2019ll travel to the city of dreams and become a movie star.\u201D\
  \ Constantly echoing in my ears, these words finally came to a halt as I saw Dad\
  \ waving at me from the other side of the arrival gate. Yes, my long-awaited dream\
  \ of coming down to Mumbai had partially come true.\nWas I happy?\nNo, the reason\
  \ I came here was a nightmare I wish had never come true.\n\u201CHow\u2019s your\
  \ job going on?\u201D, asked Dad.\nI wanted to yell out but, \u201CFine!\u201D I\
  \ said mildly.\n\u201CHow\u2019s she now?\u201D\nDad was numb pretending to concentrate\
  \ on the road as our car rushed over the Bandra-Worli sea link. The view from the\
  \ 5 km long cable-stayed bridge with concrete steel viaducts on either side towards\
  \ the skyscrapers and the serene Mahim Bay below, hardly stayed with me for a moment\
  \ as my mind was already clouded with Pari\u2019s thoughts.\nWe reached Nestle Apartments\
  \ and I hurried to room 501 where she lied beside my sister. It was 2 o\u2019 clock\
  \ at night and nobody except Mom was awake to open the door.\nThe dim yellow light\
  \ above her bald crown highlighted the stretch marks on her forehead. My 2-year-old\
  \ niece had been given radiation therapy as part of her cancer treatment.\nFor the\
  \ next few days, I had to spend my entire time running around the corridors of Tata\
  \ Hospital with my sister\u2019s handbag on one shoulder, an attendant I-card around\
  \ my neck and a striving wish in my heart to watch Pari cancer-free.\nAccompanying\
  \ my sister and niece, I observed a mother\u2019s patience and grit towards fighting\
  \ for her baby\u2019s life, her fake smiles just to fool the kid into believing\
  \ that it was just a regular routine every infant goes through and a child\u2019\
  s innocence, unaware of the devil she was trapped by.\nLooking around the hospital,\
  \ I saw hope in that beggar\u2019s eyes who had no funds, no ward for his kid and\
  \ possibly not a well-planned future even if he survives and yet, he refused to\
  \ give up on him. Spending their nights outside the hospital on the roads were several\
  \ misfortunate people poor on the financial front, but abundant with a heart that\
  \ boasted of extraordinary faith.\nThat\u2019s how precious life is! How blessed\
  \ was I to be alive!\nLuckily, I took out some time to visit the Marine Drive on\
  \ that trip. Amidst the golden rays of the sun, the infinite horizon and the chilled\
  \ breeze, I affirmed, \u201CHow dare I play small with a life I\u2019ve been blessed\
  \ with?\u201D\n\"And that's how 5 years ago, I decided to quit my job and pursue\
  \ acting.\" \"Wonderful!\", exclaimed Ellen DeGeneres as Pari & my sister smiled\
  \ from the audience's lounge."
