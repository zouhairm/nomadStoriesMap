Text: "A few years ago I was visiting my aunt in Munich.  I was seventeen and it was\
  \ a perfect opportunity to sharpen up my German skills, or so my mom thought. I\
  \ somehow managed to spend most of my time in the city library in Rosenheim Platz,\
  \ where my auntie had her tiny studio apartment with a beautiful balcony. \n\nThe\
  \ library was enormous. At least it was in my eyes since most libraries in Sarajevo\
  \ were forced to occupy spaces hardly bigger than an average living room, ever since\
  \ the National Library was set on fire under a rain of shells, back in 1992 and\
  \ in the same night when my sister was born.\n\n The part where they kept novels\
  \ in English was rather impressive. It gave me my first taste of Nabokov and George\
  \ Orwell. I don't think I ever read as much as that summer. I barely managed to\
  \ squeeze in exploring the city and the repeated visits to the Egyptian Museum,\
  \ alongside with the occasional visit to biergartens where I enjoyed my first legal\
  \ beers. \n\nMy auntie is a German teacher for the immigrants. I always thought\
  \ that was a little funny since she came to Germany two decades earlier as a refugee\
  \ who hated German and was a student of French and Italian back home. Life is funny\
  \ like that, I guess, you can't predict where you'll end up. \n\nEvery day she gave\
  \ me problems and assigned reading in German that I had to finish before she came\
  \ back from work. I was free to roam and explore, as long as I finished my work\
  \ and came home before her. Still, I mostly chose to read in the library garden\
  \ where I met Ada. \n\nAda was in her late sixties and had a bit of a wild look\
  \ in her eyes. She sat next to me on the bench, smelling of applesauce and cigarettes\
  \ and asked:\n\n\"Was liest du?\" \n\nI showed her the collection of incredibly\
  \ boring Irish fairy tales I was trying to read. She sniffed and started to chatter\
  \ in German, faster than I could understand.\n\nShe got pretty excited when I told\
  \ her that I was Bosnian. In the next half an hour she managed to tell me a story\
  \ in hand gestures and slow words. \n\nWhen she was 19 she met a man. He was Yugoslavian\
  \ and was visiting Munich for work or something like that. He managed to charm her\
  \ to his bed and left soon after. She ended up pregnant. Her parents were furious\
  \ and kicked her out. She decided to keep the child and raise him alone, working\
  \ long shifts as a dressmaker. He grew up to be a doctor. She even showed me photos\
  \ of him and his wife and their daughter. \n\nShe said it was the best thing that\
  \ happened to her."
