Text: "A random night out, with the locals.\nIt was on the third day of our visit\
  \ in Mozambique. I open my eyes, the sun in my face, well because we slept with\
  \ the curtains open. I stepped outside the balcony and the weather was beautiful\
  \ and there was just quietness. It was just too peaceful. I cannot get over how\
  \ beautiful Mozambique is. What you see in today's world of Instagram, TV and Snapchat\
  \ is exactly what you will see when you get to the place. MAGICAL.\nAnyway, my bestie\
  \ and I had a very hectic night out in Maputo: the capital of Mozambique. Also just\
  \ as beautiful. We had planed to spend the most of our third day in the beach, you\
  \ know just chilling. A part of me knew that this was not going to happen, knowing\
  \ very well how much my friend loves her sleep. So I left sleeping beauty to her\
  \ sleep, went to have breakfast then headed to the beach alone. While I wasn\u2019\
  t sure about what I was doing and where I am going, especial as a solo woman traveller.\
  \ I felt safe and it was easy to make friend, that\u2019s just how warm and welcoming\
  \ the people there are.\nAs I pass the first beach, there were about five ladies\
  \ who were chilling. So I\u2019m starting to think to myself that, this walking\
  \ alone can\u2019t be that bad. I continue walking, until I saw a group of guys\
  \ and two ladies chilling and just having fun. So I decide to sit a bit further\
  \ away from them. As I watch the beach, taken aback by how beautiful this overlooked\
  \ country is. These two guys walk up to me, as they get closer. I have a little\
  \ conversation with myself, to try and stay out of trouble this time around. I say\
  \ this because; my bestie and I find ourselves into a bit of a trouble every time\
  \ when we travel together. These guys greet in Portuguese. I greet back with my\
  \ polished Portuguese accent (HOLA), because, hey now! My Portuguese was brushed\
  \ up a bit (smiles).\nSo we started chatting about where they are from and where\
  \ I am from. They invite me to join them where they were seated. I agree. We chill\
  \ there until it gets late. After that we decide to go to a nearby bar for a few\
  \ mhhhh, you know, drinks. The next time I check my time, it was already 3:00am.\
  \ \nI decide to go back to the lodge, to check if my friend is still okay. I get\
  \ to the room, bestie is not there. I see a note on my bed side saying \u201Cwent\
  \ out with the friends we met yesterday to Maputo, be back in the a.m.\u2019s\u201D\
  \ what to do? I called my Mozambiquean friends, they were still at the bar, and\
  \ they came to fetch me. As they say, the rest is history."
