Text: "Upon waking, the Irish deity Canola was mesmerised by a melancholic echo across\
  \ the sea. She searched, discovering the sound within a beached whale on the shore,\
  \ swirling through its bones and sinew. And thus the harp was borne into Ireland\u2019\
  s folklore. In the land of accreted myth, it is Ireland\u2019s relationship with\
  \ nature that is the most fascinating. And the findings of beauty within sadness\
  \ which permeate Irish culture. You could say, a melancholic beauty, is ever-present.\n\
  \nAnd so I arrive in Westport, Ireland. My first step off the Dublin-Westport train\
  \ is met with a core-chilling damp and a sea-sickness still catching in my throat.\
  \ The twelve hour rail-and-sail crossing from Holyhead to Dublin is a fitting entry\
  \ into my Motherland: a beautiful yet slightly unruly adventure. I maintain this\
  \ despite heaving \u201CGET ME OFF\u201D down the phone to friends for the most\
  \ part of the journey, the boat lurching forth with every chopped wave.\n\nIn Westport,\
  \ my taxi driver is warm with a hint of trouble and he bulldozes us through the\
  \ swathes of green until we reach Westport town. He warns me every so often, \u201C\
  don\u2019t speak to Eddie,\u201D and drops me off at the lively local M.J. Hobans.\
  \ Guinness is lined up, the wooden slats are oozing with the smell of beer and I\
  \ am now avoiding anyone named Eddie. The conviviality of the Irish is familiar\
  \ and comforting; my family name is dissected within five minutes and I am already\
  \ invited to sing. What my mother likes to call nosiness, I see as a genuine interest\
  \ in people and their community. It is extremely humanising. \n\nA gravelled voice\
  \ croons from the other side of the room and an attentive silence engulfs the room.\
  \ The song is spontaneous but note-perfect. Harrowing verses of the WWI-tribute,\
  \ Christmas 1915, are met with cheers and laughter and the chorus swells with discordant\
  \ folk, a fiddle and guitar joining in. This uplifting melancholy strikes me most\
  \ on my travels to Westport. And the inclusivity. It is a moment without barriers:\
  \ the young and the old, the musicians and the tone-deaf, the natives and the travellers\
  \ all congregate to sing without judgement. It is a haven for all irrespective of\
  \ ability, heritage or age, truly in the name of \u201Ccraic agus ceoul\u201D (fun\
  \ and music). \n\nThe Irish folk singer Christy Moore wrote, \u201Cfor all our languages,\
  \ we can\u2019t communicate\u201D. I disagree, we can. Through song."
