Text: "We walked by the Colosseum with its Disney-like line of tourists wrapped around\
  \ the building. \u201CTourista\u201D, he said with a frown, and hurried past. \n\
  \nWe met him in the center of Piazza Popolo. A short, bald, Italian man with a brown\
  \ corduroy jacket holding a sign so we would recognize him\u2026or at least his\
  \ name.\n\nHe was the brother of a friend. \u201CCall my brother when you get to\
  \ Rome.\u201D\n\nWe didn\u2019t allow an American sense of inconveniencing a stranger\
  \ in a foreign country to stop us. We called. \n\nThe noon hour arrived. \n\n\u201C\
  I think he\u2019s inviting us home for lunch.\u201D\n\nI stood on a pillar and shouted,\
  \ \u201CDoes anybody know how to speak English and Italian?\u201D\n\nA woman rushed\
  \ up the stairs and an animated conversation ensued. \u201CAh yes!\u201D she said\
  \ with delight, \u201CHis wife has been cooking all morning. He wants you to come\
  \ to his home for lunch. You will have to take the train; it\u2019s an hour ride.\u201D\
  \n\nMy first thought was how generous of him to take the day off work and travel\
  \ an hour\u2019s distance to meet a band of strangers. My second thought was, let\u2019\
  s go!\n\nIn humble surroundings filled with the aromas of joy and pasta we ate.\
  \ And ate some more. We didn\u2019t speak a common language yet there was no lack\
  \ of laughter and conversation. \n\nWe retreated to the cozy living room. Homemade\
  \ limoncello appeared from a small wooden cabinet made for storing ornate bottles\
  \ and small sipping glasses.\n\nThen, the course of the afternoon took a sudden\
  \ shift.\n\nMy husband mentioned he wanted a pair of real Italian shoes. The problem\
  \ was the shops didn\u2019t have his size. Apparently, Italians have small feet.\n\
  \nOur guests leaped into action. In a whirlwind we were out the door running through\
  \ the streets of town\u2026and I do mean running\u2026because our \u201Celderly\u201D\
  \ hosts had the energy of teenagers.\n\nThey seemed to know everyone in town and\
  \ beamed with pride as they introduced their American friends. We found a shoe shop\
  \ with one, and only one, pair of shoes close to my husband\u2019s size.\n\nClose.\n\
  \nAs my husband sat on a chair, Franco had one foot, his wife the other, and like\
  \ a scene out of Cinderella with her evil step-sisters, they stuffed his feet into\
  \ the shoes. As the second heel passed all resistance, our hosts literally jumped\
  \ up and cheered. Franco immediately went to the shop\u2019s proprietor to haggle\
  \ the best deal for his new American friend.\n\nMy husband looked at me, \u201C\
  I have to buy these shoes whether they fit or not!\u201D\n\nWalking out, shoe bag\
  \ in hand, the hosts declared the day a success.\n\nAnd it was."
