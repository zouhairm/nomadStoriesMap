Text: "Narrow cobble stoned streets, dreamy canals, ivy covered houses, forgotten\
  \ churches and horse carriage rides are the things that might come to your mind\
  \ when you think of the fairy tale town of Bruges. And, you are right in thinking\
  \ that most of us would take a romantic couples trip, with the significant other,\
  \ to enjoy kissing in the narrow streets and eat waffles in the market square. So\
  \ to say that I visited the town to reminiscence and discover the pin-sharp script\
  \ of my favourite movie- In Bruges- can be a disappointment to a few. \n\nOn a non-descript\
  \ autumn day, I spent one day in the town of Bruges on my way to Dunkirk. I traipsed\
  \ religiously through all the places where the movie was shot. As an ode to the\
  \ crepuscular tone of the movie, I found myself staring at non-touristy random,\
  \ common things until a local florist questioned by intention. With a little help\
  \ from a handy map of the town and the movie poster in my phone, I managed to convince\
  \ him that I was not a low-life criminal planning a murder. . I grabbed a loaded\
  \ waffle at Chez Albert, and diligently plotted the places in order with my green\
  \ felt pen. The town is relentless, and every turn leads you back to the stylish\
  \ Relais Bourgondisch Cruyce hotel. A canal boat ride is the rite of passage for\
  \ sightseeing, to see the old brick houses and, the ducks and swans. Yes, they have\
  \ proper, actual swans. My favorite spots in the city were the quaint little Meestrat\
  \ Bridge and the Koningin Astridpark. The beauty of this titular town is not due\
  \ to the ginger bread like houses, it is the fact that you will casually stumble\
  \ upon a 15th century landmark in middle of your coffee run. \n\nThe earthiness\
  \ of the place is so neatly embroidered it is sentimental even to think that for\
  \ a shopkeeper this is just another day at work. As the sun sets, the lamp lit streets\
  \ of Bruges spread a warm, luminous glow as I trudge on the cobbles to enjoy a beer\
  \ at \u2018t Zwart Huis. The Belfry towers ominously in the background as the horses\
  \ stomp their hooves on their way back to the barn perhaps. \n\nThe last thing I\
  \ expected, when I left the town, was to concur mildly with the character Harry\
  \ Waters, the criminal played by Ralph Fiennes. He says, \u2018Everyone should visit\
  \ Bruges before they die\u2019. Indeed."
