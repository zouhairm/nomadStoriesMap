Text: "On a warm spring day, we wanted to go somewhere, but had no idea where to go.\
  \ Next came the big question, where should we go? \n\nWe approached the highway\
  \ with anxious anticipation. Since we were undecided on where to go, we chose to\
  \ head to Belgaum, watch a movie and have lunch at a nice place. \n\nLife is like\
  \ that. We seek something easy but if we stick to what our heart wants to follow,\
  \ we could end up on a journey that takes us to breathless places and experience\
  \ moments that otherwise we would never have imagined. We never know we have lived\
  \ until we have lived. \n\nWe stopped for lunch at a shack and all our senses were\
  \ dulled. The fish curry and rice went together like a married couple though. The\
  \ fish was delicate on the palate and the aroma of the food only made us want more.\
  \ \n\nAfter lunch we asked our host about what could be done around that place.\
  \ He suggested a waterfall, which was not too far away. We headed towards the waterfall\
  \ and in our excitement, we got lost. \n\nWe each have our defining moments, decisions\
  \ that either lead us to something new or decisions that lead us to learn something\
  \ new. We felt like it was one of those moments that determined our future. \n\n\
  We went on the road least traveled, which was treacherous. All the time maneuvering\
  \ the bike, like a ballet dancer, around the rocks and stones. The road became wider\
  \ and the view was spectacular. \n\nThe hill moved upward and the path snake like.\
  \ There was a beautiful gorge and the river meandered like an elegant veil flowing\
  \ in the wind. The road twisted and turned like a King Cobra pursuing a prey.\n\n\
  There was a small path and trees branching out with all their might and blocking\
  \ out the sun. The sun being adamant sending little waves of light filtering through\
  \ the foliage. Along the path was a rivulet, the water was crystal clear and little\
  \ fish swimming alongside the path.\n\nAt the end of the path was the waterfall,\
  \ which was magnificent. When suddenly, a gush of water pushed us over the edge\
  \ and we both started to fall. The moment ended with an abrupt crashing in the water.\
  \ We were shaken out of our wits.  \n\nWe all go through life thinking that we need\
  \ moments to define who we are. Are we champions or are we the ones that hit the\
  \ floor and remain there? We wait for opportunities to tell us what to do. Sometimes\
  \ we get those opportunities and when we do not, we need to define them ourselves.\n\
  \nWe got back on that ledge just to jump one more time."
