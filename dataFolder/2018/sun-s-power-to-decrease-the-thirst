Text: "I am a solar engineer and my job takes me to different terrains. It is in the\
  \ middle of February where the summer is picking up slowly from the dying winter\
  \ days. From Visakhapatnam, I took a train to Bissam Cuttack in Orissa. It was almost\
  \ dusk by the time I had reached the destination. Since it was dark, I could not\
  \ make out my surroundings except for the mountains shining in dark. It is hard\
  \ to believe that there are villages not connected to electricity grid yet.\n\n\
  Next morning, Satish, our NGO volunteer has taken me to a small muddy water pool\
  \ created by a passing stream. Some of the villagers are washing their utensils\
  \ there. In a distance, I find people taking bath in the pool. While we were waiting,\
  \ village women made their way with mud pots. They washed the pots in the pool and\
  \ filled the pots at the inlet of the pool.  They are collecting the topmost layer\
  \ of the water to avoid the mud particles and filtered with the help of a cotton\
  \ cloth tied at the top of the vessel. The scene left me speechless. Tears started\
  \ to roll down my cheeks making my eyes fuzzy. I never imagined that people are\
  \ still drinking water from the untidy environment like the one I had witnessed.\
  \ \n\nSatish walked close to me and said, \u201CThis is the condition of drinking\
  \ water here Pramod\u201D. He added, \u201CThere is a village few kilometres upstream\
  \ and the water coming could have been used feeding cattle or washing utensils before\
  \ it reaches here. And the water going out from this pool will be used by another\
  \ village further downstream.\u201D \n\nWiping off my tears at the drinking water\
  \ condition, I understood the immediate priority \u2013 expedite the installation\
  \ of the solar water pump. I ensured that our team did not lack for any utility\
  \ tools and ensured a speedy installation of the solar water pump. \n\nA group of\
  \ women walked towards us at the end after filling their pots with water from the\
  \ pump and said, \u201CWe never imagined that this could happen in our lifetime\u201D\
  . They expressed their wishes joining their hands together with gratitude. Satish\
  \ with a weak smile added, \u201CIn summers, they don\u2019t get a single drop of\
  \ water from that pool there. They need to walk miles to get some water to drink\
  \ for the whole family.\u201D \nWith emotional satisfaction of having helped, we\
  \ wrapped up and moved to our next destination. \nThat trip has taken me through\
  \ 25 villages which did not have electricity. \n\nWe cannot bear a drained phone\
  \ battery, but there are villages which do not even have the power supply."
