Text: As I touched down I could feel the difference in air I could feel the changes
  when I looked around everyone got that charm on their face living as if it is their
  last day.   Walked around my first day saw people are enthusiastic about everything
  they love they work with a smile kids run over in and around that brings joy as
  I passes myself through these valleys mountains sea I wandered as the earth is always
  beautiful no matter who tries to destroy it. The local people at the remote areas
  they are legit human beings they don't ask luxury but still work hard in return
  they don't even ask anything but yes when you are in trouble they help you out with
  every best possible way they ever could. They welcome you as if they know you from
  decades as if you are their family their own race where do to find this usually.
  The way they laugh their pure golden heart. As I moved on to the caves and hills
  it made me feel calm I could feel my soul lighten the sun set made me cry as I saw
  something beautiful going away but yet hoping for that beautifulness to be seen
  again. I wandered every possible way every possible moment everyday and then found
  myself that inner me said nothing here on earth is ugly or bad we all have our own
  uniqueness what matters the most is not how we see things but it's about how we
  feel and everyone everything is beautiful and as I mean that I believe we all have
  to smile and look for all goodness and leave the bad memories ugly thoughts out
  of our mind we are here to learn not to compete but to stay in harmony together
  to realize that life is all what we have and we gotta create a better place so that
  we carve our life in such a way that we start living earth start loving ourselves
  and love everyone you meet on this journey of life because we get what we give and
  I'm pretty sure you give love a loads of love and joy is what you get in return
  and that's all you gotta expect from anyone.
