Text: "The breeze of the night had come fast. All the drops on our bodies were long\
  \ gone. The sand hiding in our clothes, the salt of the sea populating our heads.\
  \ The day was already behind and had left the stage to an unexpected Greek evening.\
  \ The beach was so remote and far from the place we were staying at that we decided\
  \ to stop a little longer and have dinner there.\n\n\u201COh, so you are Albanian,\
  \ not Greek? My fianc\xE9 is Albanian too!\u201D, said one of my friends to the\
  \ waiter. And they immediately delved into a dense conversation between them, leaving\
  \ the rest of us unaware of what was about to happen.\n\u201CFollow me\u201D were\
  \ the only words we understood when we started what we thought would be an ordinary\
  \ stroll by the sea.\n\nWe walked for a while, until all lights of the restaurant\
  \ and small establishments were nothing but a distant memory. Just the hue of the\
  \ moon and the stars lit our steps on the sand. \u201CHere, this should be the right\
  \ spot\u201D. We were curious to know more, but no clue of what was awaiting us.\
  \ A little hint was a bunch of sticks put together to form some sort of pyramid.\
  \ We crouched down and waited patiently in a rigorous silence. Whispering, the boy\
  \ told us we were exactly in the most propitious time of the year for turtles\u2019\
  \ births. We were surrounded by hundreds of nests and could be lucky to witness\
  \ this miracle of nature that night.\n\nIt was good practice to stay quiet and to\
  \ not to interfere with any light or by touching the animals. Although, it was unnecessary\
  \ information as we were all staring at the nest in respectful contemplation.\n\n\
  It happened so quickly we could barely see it in that pitch-black night. However,\
  \ it moved: a tiny black spot, as small and round as a coin, clumsily making its\
  \ way out of that desert of sand, following the call of the sea. Speechless and\
  \ paralysed by the scene, we followed our baby tentatively \u2013 but at the same\
  \ time firmly \u2013 stepping towards the big wet unknown world. Its natural instinct\
  \ won over everything, leaving us fascinated by the power of the almighty. The smell\
  \ of the water, the sound of the waves, the light of the stars and the lullaby of\
  \ the moon guided it, our little creature, our new friend, until it merged with\
  \ its new habitat, entering its life with all the love we had infused by supporting\
  \ its entrance in the diamond sea."
