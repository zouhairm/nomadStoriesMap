Text: "Right from the pages of Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code to the wave of that pious\
  \ hand of the Pope from the balcony of his abode at the Apostolic Palace, I have\
  \ always been very keen to know about the nooks and corner of this city state where\
  \ history and catholicism has seen a journey through troughs and crests. Rome has\
  \ always been under the rule of the Bishop of the state i.e. Pope with his catholic\
  \ clergy till 1929. Romw acquired its independence from the Roman Catholic rule\
  \ in 1929 where much of the dominion over soverignty by the Papacy was curbed to\
  \ be in the governing jurisdiction of the city state.\n\nAs soon as I started takimg\
  \ an interest in knowing the world around me the first place that caught my attention\
  \ was this city state of Vatican. The art and architectures, the aura and people,\
  \ all have been like a dream. The St. Peter's Basilica, the Sistine Chapel and the\
  \ enormous meuseums are like a dream. Some of the most interesting things are the\
  \ paintings and sculptures of famous people like Michelangelo, Maderno, Boticelli,\
  \ Bernini etc.\n\nOne will be amazed to see the inter linked road ways, the chapels\
  \ and churches, and the louvre. In 1984 Vatican City was enlisted by UNESCO as a\
  \ World Heritage Site. Do you remember the Madonna and the Child and the famous\
  \ painting of Mona Lisa and Vitruvian Man by Da Vinci. Yes none other than Vatican\
  \ holds such a huge store of art and culture. The city state is fringed by the Tiber\
  \ river on its West Bank. And being the appropriate centre of attraction stands\
  \ St. Peter's square. Rome and Italy shares a Lateran Treaty according to which\
  \ properties are scattered all over Rome and Italy. \n\nOne major accessibility\
  \ that prevails here is that there are no passport control for visitors coming into\
  \ the Vatican from surrounding Italy. Public is allowed free movement in and around\
  \ St. Peter's Square and Basilica and for Papal audience. Amidst the mild and moist\
  \ climate with winter rains this city has an inexplicable scenic extravaganze that\
  \ has acted as a catalyst to  pull people all around the globe to explore its myths,\
  \ histories and religion, art and culture. \n\nVatican is the only city state that\
  \ does not has an airport instead only a Heliport serves the air travel purpose.\
  \ With a well developed transport network and a small transport facilty Vatican\
  \ city has made movement much easier with standard gauge railway Italy to Rome.\
  \ With beautiful gardens acquiring almost half of the city's area Vatican has always\
  \ been a spectacle."
