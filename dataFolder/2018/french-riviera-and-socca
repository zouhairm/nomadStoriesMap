Text: "I guess that beginning this story by describing my adventurous trip to Australia\
  \ or that time I got lost in the jungle would be quite easy. On the contrary, I\
  \ decided not to go far from home and to describe a 10 days trip I did with my mother\
  \ 5 years ago now: an on-the-road trip towards Aix-en-Provence, southern France,\
  \ departing from Venice and through all the C\xF4te d\u2019Azure.\nOur car, an old\
  \ station wagon Suzuki, was fully packed: I was going to spend a semester abroad\
  \ and I needed every centimeter that car could store. In addition to this, my mother\
  \ and I needed primary food for the next ten days: even though September is not\
  \ considered as high season, the French Riviera is still quite expensive and we\
  \ were on a little budget.\nThe first stop for us was Menton, where we arrived quite\
  \ late. As soon as you pass the border, the landscape changes and, I don\u2019t\
  \ know why, but you can tell you are no longer in Italy. We smelled France everywhere:\
  \ in the heat of the summer night, in the streets full of honey and lemon shops,\
  \ in the sea breeze. The first impression was good and we were ready to deepen into\
  \ the French culture, passing through the richness of Monaco and Saint-Tropez and\
  \ the blue of Antibes to the everyday life of Aix-en-Provence, Marseille and Nice.\n\
  One of the best memories I have is a dinner in Nice: we were halfway through our\
  \ journey and it was my mother\u2019s birthday. We decided then to have dinner at\
  \ a local restaurant: while walking in the old town, we found this incredibly crowded\
  \ place (Ren\xE9 Socca) and we stopped there to eat like the locals do. Two portions\
  \ of socca (a local kind of flat bread made with chickpeas) and two glasses of red\
  \ wine later, we were wondering how would it be to live in Nice like many stars\
  \ did.\nLater on, when the images of the Promenade des Anglais after the terrorist\
  \ attack passed on tv, I thought of the day my mother and I spent there, laughing\
  \ and enjoying the last summer sun. I also think of the moment we left Italy for\
  \ France and on the images of migrants struggling at Ventimiglia to go and get a\
  \ better life, for them and for their families.\nThe last thing I expected from\
  \ this adventure was to know myself better: not only did I strengthen the relationship\
  \ with my mother, but I realized I empathize a lot with who surrounds me. The feelings\
  \ that a travel experience leaves me change according to what happens next, to me\
  \ or in the world. I learnt to accept both the good and positive vibes: traveling\
  \ is the best school."
