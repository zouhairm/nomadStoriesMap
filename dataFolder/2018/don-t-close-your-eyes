Text: "I really haven\u2019t been this scared my entire life.  I\u2019m standing here\
  \ and it\u2019s no ones\u2019 fault but my own and I see no way out.  Well, I can\
  \ strip down and sneak away but I\u2019m not the last in line.  All these thoughts\
  \ and more keep coming to mind\u2026I may never get this chance again \u2013 I will\
  \ look back on this moment and regret it all my life if I don\u2019t try \u2013\
  \ My instinct must be telling me to turn back for a reason!\n\nNow it\u2019s my\
  \ turn.  Why does my mouth feel like I\u2019ve held it open in front of a fan for\
  \ ten minutes?  Why can I barely feel anything beyond my heart telling me to retreat\
  \ while I move forward?  Then a voice wiggles its way into my fuzzy thoughts \u2013\
  \ \u201CReady\u201D?  I shook my head no as words will not come.  The man looked\
  \ at me blankly.  Clearly, I stood in this line for this very thing and I tell him\
  \ \u201CNo\u201D?  He motions me forward and I sit in the \u2018chair of death\u2019\
  \ on the precipice of Hell.  Okay, I\u2019m exaggerating, but I am getting ready\
  \ to leap off a real cliff 1/3-mile-high and go 65 miles per hour on what looks\
  \ like a tiny, tiny cable for a mile and a half.  Oh, and I don\u2019t think I mentioned\
  \ I\u2019m afraid of heights.  I get two stories up and I have a big issue.  And\
  \ I\u2019m preparing to go on the longest zip line on the planet in Copper Canyon,\
  \ Mexico!\n\nThe decision to go through with this, despite all my fear, pushed me\
  \ to the edge of my comfort zone and beyond.  So, they have you sit in a chair and\
  \ strap you in\u2026not that the strapping would help in a fall a third of a mile\
  \ high but, okay.  Then tears build as you wait for the chute to open, like horses\
  \ at the races starting gates.  I\u2019m sorry to say I shut my eyes for the first\
  \ few seconds of launch.  But then something happened.  I opened my eyes and tears\
  \ are streaming down my face.  I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s because I\u2019m going\
  \ 65 miles per hour or if they are tears of wonder.  I look to my right, left, up,\
  \ down.  I am encompassed in beauty and full of awe for almost three minutes.  \n\
  \nWhen I land on the platform I don\u2019t feel like the three minutes were enough,\
  \ but they became more than I expected.  You see, I can walk around two, three,\
  \ four stories and I have no fear now.  The most miraculous change\u2026when I encounter\
  \ fear in my everyday life, I think \u2013 if you could do that zipline, you can\
  \ conquer this.  And I do.  \n\nSo \u201Cthanks\u201D, longest zip line on the planet.\
  \  I\u2019ve not only learned to face extreme fear, I\u2019ve learned I have the\
  \ capacity within myself to keep fear from standing in my way of what may become\
  \ life-changing moments."
