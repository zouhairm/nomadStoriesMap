Text: "Throughout my travels, I have learned to avoid dance floors. So often, as a\
  \ foreigner, I get picked up and swung around like a rag doll, searching the crowd\
  \ for a friendly face to save me. A quick gesture toward the bathroom doors or a\
  \ clever maneuver can get me out of a tight grip and to the closest exit but both\
  \ are sometimes easier said than done. Sometimes, I try to pull away and say that\
  \ that \u201Cpartner-dancing\u201D is not for me and that dancing by myself feels\
  \ most natural. I used to say it so often that it started to feel true.\nYou can\
  \ imagine my surprise when I found myself in Indonesia savouring each second of\
  \ a square dance with a man dressed like a cowboy, all in black, more than three\
  \ times my age. I was at a huge barbeque celebrating the birthday of a 5 year old\
  \ girl, the niece of someone I met the day before. At 11 pm the party was just getting\
  \ started and I was trying to blend in, sitting on a cracked plastic chair, near\
  \ a wall, behind planters overflowing with leafy palms. \nI sat shyly, with what\
  \ felt like a giant spotlight on me \u2013 children were coming up and offering\
  \ me various foods and running away when I took the gifts from their tiny, outstretched\
  \ hands. The potted plants were clearly not doing a great job of hiding me. Each\
  \ time the children seemed to elect a different representative to come up to me\
  \ with offerings of fried plantains, spiky red rambutan fruit or shelled nuts. They\
  \ all giggled from a distance, watching my impressive pile of food grow in my lap.\n\
  Suddenly an older gent approached me with a confidence like no other. Pulling me\
  \ up with a strong arm and inviting smile, I was led to the center of the room,\
  \ amid applause \u2013 there was no turning back. I reluctantly faced him, my expression\
  \ skeptical while he smiled, looking passed me, face relaxed, eyes focused. \nSeconds\
  \ later my body was no longer mine. Hip to hip, our feet moved in unison and I suddenly,\
  \ seemingly randomly, knew how to square dance. My body betrayed me, recognizing\
  \ brand new rhythms and anticipating moves that somehow did not feel unnatural and\
  \ forced. We danced in circles around a table full of smoked meats, rice and deep\
  \ fried foods while the children followed suit, cheering.\nHe took my hand, my nameless\
  \ Indonesian Johnny Cash, and I have not been able to forget it. Time has passed\
  \ but the memory lingers. I now travel with an open mind, my feet aching to dance."
