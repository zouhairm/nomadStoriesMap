Text: "Exiting the park through the main gate left me dejected. We had just heard\
  \ some alarm calls from a couple of Sambhar deer and tourists in other vehicles\
  \ claimed to spot some movement. We were on the verge of encountering a wild tiger.\
  \ I suddenly spotted a beautiful Black Rumped Flameback woodpecker amongst the dry\
  \ deciduous trees when out of nowhere, the driver decided to head back towards the\
  \ gate because one of our co-passengers wanted to pee. It was the most senseless\
  \ decision ever and I felt I wasn\u2019t destined to see a tiger, ever. Our Maruti\
  \ Gypsy was the first to leave the park because of that idiot who couldn\u2019t\
  \ control his bladder. I turned back one final time, desperately looking at the\
  \ lake and the fort ruins for which Ranthambore was so famous, hoping to catch the\
  \ glimpse of a tiger. Nothing! \nNot only was I disappointed because I couldn\u2019\
  t see my favorite animal in the wild, but also envied all the other tourists as\
  \ they would go back to their rooms with great memories to cherish whereas I would\
  \ have to satisfy myself with some deer and monkeys. After Rahul used the washroom,\
  \ we headed back towards the hotel. We reached a clearing just outside the gate\
  \ of the park surrounded by the mighty hills of the Aravalli ranges when I saw some\
  \ movement behind a large tree. Suddenly, I was filled with hope, thinking that\
  \ this was my tryst with destiny. I confidently asked the driver to stop the vehicle\
  \ but sadly, it turned out to be a chital deer, which were plentiful in the park.\
  \ Before the driver could start the vehicle however, our guide hit him hard and\
  \ pointed his finger towards a foothill. There it was, stealthily moving with a\
  \ certain chivalry, the Royal Bengal Tiger. It posed for our cameras for almost\
  \ 10 minutes, marking out trees with its scent, scanning its territory. I was overjoyed\
  \ and went and thanked Rahul for the perfect timing of his bladder and we laughed\
  \ about it for almost the entire night. When we reached the hotel, we got news that\
  \ ours was the only vehicle which had spotted the elusive cat. Things just went\
  \ too right on that day and something very unusual was the hero."
