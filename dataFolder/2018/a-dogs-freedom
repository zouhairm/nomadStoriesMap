Text: "The vibration of the motorbike is constant and all consuming, roaring through\
  \ my body starting at my toes. A high-pitched whistle dances around my ear similar\
  \ to a car speeding through a tunnel. The Vietnam rice fields are in bloom and the\
  \ grass lies like the fallen leaves of autumn. It\u2019s the smell of mud compacted\
  \ tightly against the water buffalos dry skin that consumes all my senses.  I am\
  \ alive in this moment, at peace, and because of the girl driving I am also free.\
  \ \n\nFreedom was unfathomable for my kind, such justice was not granted for those\
  \ who resemble street rats. I was a slave to the streets and I envied the cows that\
  \ roamed freely while I stood defenseless against the abundant predators that gathered\
  \ on every corner, clamming their territory to the world. Their snouts rose high\
  \ in confidence and their tails asserting dominance. I\u2019m a female, alone, unprotected,\
  \ terrified, and imprisoned by my own body unable to move. These were the streets\
  \ of Tamil Nadu, India, and this was my home. \nI was liberated the night of February\
  \ 20, 2017. The air was cooler, relieved of the sweltering heat brought by the days\
  \ warm rays. Small gatherings of humans sat around tables enjoying their meals.\
  \ I could hear each bite they took, and my mouth begged for just a taste. My eyes\
  \ were heavy, weak, and desperate. Surrounded by a dreary darkness I laid on the\
  \ Earths surface my head split open the blood sewed my eyes shut. I hadn\u2019t\
  \ eaten in days and my stomach gnawed at my insides, the need for survival demanding\
  \ to be feed, and then she walked in. \nHer scent was foreign and her energy warm\
  \ and inviting. I urged my body on top of her bag and I lay there until she noticed\
  \ my presence. Before I knew it she picked me up swaddling me like a child. Her\
  \ voice soothing like a lullaby as she whispered, \u201Ceverything will be okay.\u201D\
  \ I opened my eyes trying to look through the coded muck of thick blood and saw\
  \ the foggy imagine of her face, light skin and dark features, her touch was comfortable\
  \ and her scent was similar to my own. She placed me down on the ground and said\
  \ \u201C this is your life, your freedom of choice. Come with me or I will love\
  \ you from afar.\u201D She left with only a glance of goodbye and the decision was\
  \ made. I walked out into the unknown and I followed her home. When we reached our\
  \ destination she turned to me the promise in her smile. I would no longer suffer,\
  \ go hungry or spend my life alone. My promise to her was unconditional love and\
  \ her promise to me was freedom."
