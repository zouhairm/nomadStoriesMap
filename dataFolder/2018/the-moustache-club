Text: "In Jaipur the moustache is king.  Extravagant in volume and elegant in execution,\
  \ Rajasthani facial hair is the stuff of legend.  So I wasn't surprised when the\
  \ barber trimmed my beard but left everything above the lip intact.  I was sure\
  \ I looked ridiculous but he made reassuring noises and sent me on my way.\nI wandered\
  \ through the dusty market streets drinking sugar-cane and lime juice, and letting\
  \ the sights and sounds of the Pink City wash over me.  The air was thick with the\
  \ scent of incense and exhaust fumes, of cowdung and spices.  \nFrom a doorstep\
  \ by the Gangori Gate, a young man called out to me. \u201CNice beard!\u201D  I\
  \ laughed, and we got talking.  His name was Amar and he worked as a computer programmer.\
  \  Delighted to learn that my moustache was locally made, he invited me to take\
  \ chai in his home.  I was led upstairs to a flat rooftop with a lean-too built\
  \ against the ramparts.  Amar introduced his wife, Karishma, who was busy grinding\
  \ lentils to make daal, while their two year old daughter played with a bright red\
  \ plastic toy truck.  A little shyly, he showed me around his home. I stopped to\
  \ look at a photograph of a 1970s hipster decked out in flares, a big-collared shirt\
  \ and, of course, a luxurious 'tache.\n'That's my Dad.' said Amar, proudly, 'He's\
  \ an artist.  You've got to meet him.'\nWe sat on plastic chairs drinking chai and\
  \ watching birds roosting in the trees above the gate.  Then a delighted giggle\
  \ from the little girl announced the arrival of Amar's father, Ramashankar.  Dressed\
  \ all in white, he had an orange tilaka on his forehead, and the swinger's moustache\
  \ of his youth had matured into a glorious beard.  He took the seat next to mine,\
  \ and leaning in close to speak, he talked of his work.  A miniaturist, he painted\
  \ elephants in gold and azure using brushes of chipmunk hair.  \nWhen the chai was\
  \ finished, Ramashankar took me to see the temple.  Beneath a statue of Ganesha,\
  \ a group of old men were sitting.  We joined them and while they passed round a\
  \ chillum, Ramashankar told me a little of his story.  He had been to London once\
  \ to visit his brother, but was indifferent to its charms.  His art was in Jaipur,\
  \ and art, he said, is life.\nDusk was coming on and it was time to go.  I said\
  \ goodbye, and was assured of a warm welcome should I come by this place again.\n\
  The moustache never really felt right and I trimmed it when I reached Mumbai.  But\
  \ it had opened a door to a little piece of India that I would have never seen,\
  \ clean shaven."
