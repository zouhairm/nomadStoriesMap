Text: "Founded somewhere in 584 during the ages of Roman Empire. Or probably between\
  \ 166 and 169 AD. Who knows right now? Nobody can find the truth. But Venice is\
  \ so rich in its history, that it has loads of stories to tell.\nOnce, I came across\
  \ an article that caught my attention. Short, something about \u201CCommedia dell\u2019\
  arte\u201D and hidden identities. It was description of the 18th century Venetian\
  \ Shop. This grabbed my attention but in the daily routine all that information\
  \ faded.\nIn suumer I appeared to be in Venice. The sun was right in the middle\
  \ of the sky. People resembled a squad of hectic bees. Or giggling hecks, dashing\
  \ around. A comparison with \u201CDante\u2019s Inferno\u201D came to my mind.\n\
  Tourists were the ones producing the bustle. But locals were relaxing. Drinking\
  \ their dark devil\u2019s drinks - cappuccinos - and hiding smiles behind every\
  \ single mug. \n-Il caff\xE8, il gelato! - was shouting one of the shopkeepers.\n\
  -Grazie, non voglio. - I almost whispered those words and dived into the shop nearby\
  \ to escape from him.\nA creaky door closed. The noise disappeared like it never\
  \ existed. The scent of fresh wood and oil covered me like a veil. My mind was completely\
  \ conquered by dim light and thickness of the air. Hidden kingdom of Masks. Mocking\
  \ faces and gloomy empty eyes staring at me from the ceiling and walls. Feathers\
  \ of all hints shaped by rouge and crimson ribbons. Every detail was sparkling.\
  \ Bizarre Black Plague Masks and carnival faces with bordo lips. I felt so small\
  \ and unprotected amongst the silent power of dead expressions. Carcasses of future\
  \ masques were lying on the master\u2019s table. Soon he appeared himself. \n-Parlo\
  \ l\u2019italiano un poco. - I apologized. He smiled, opening his perfectly white\
  \ teeth. He was wearing the simple grey T-shirt and an apron. Such a simple and\
  \ powerful ruler among glory of his inventions.\nThat day I couldn\u2019t allow\
  \ buying any of masks. Only one postcard with Columbina. But the black curly Italian,\
  \ wearing a beige apron and explaining the features of his Harlequins, remained\
  \ in my mind. His hands were dirty but eyes were crystally clear. \nOnly when I\
  \ came out of the shop I noticed the sign: \"Founded in 1775\" (and the barely seen\
  \ addition: again reconstructed in 1979). Rxactly that mask shop that I read about\
  \ in the article!\nAnd even after several months, I can sharply remember the dark\
  \ brown colour of eyes of Italian. Like he was blowing the power to his masks through\
  \ this deep look. And something supernatural was glittering in it."
