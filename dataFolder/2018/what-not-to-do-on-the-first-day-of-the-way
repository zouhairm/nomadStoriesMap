Text: "10 am, Braga, Portugal. Walking the Way of Saint James is a very personal journey\
  \ mostly because it is up to you to make your way, in all senses, logistically too.\
  \ Departing so late, in August, was our first mistake. Nevertheless, we were excited,\
  \ and we couldn\u2019t help but to marvel at some sights, like the small Roman bridge\
  \ crossing a river in Vila do Prado, with a lonely blue boat anchored near, under\
  \ a tree whose branches fell unto the water, or the medieval tower of Penegate,\
  \ whose fortified top appeared surprisingly in ours field of vision. \n12 am. It\
  \ was getting hotter by the minute and the way seemed to be made of only ascending\
  \ paths through woods and fields. We had run out of water and we hadn\u2019t crossed\
  \ ways with a living soul! We did run into a house, eventually, and the owner immediately\
  \ gave us water, but also hope: villages near. And luckily, soon after, we crossed\
  \ paths with some pilgrims doing the way on bike. \u201CGood way\u201D, they said,\
  \ the soundest of all we would hear in the next days. And they were a lot. \n3 pm,\
  \ Goi\xE3es. We found a typical refugee for pilgrims to spend the nights. We should\
  \ have ended the day there, but we didn\u2019t. It was insanely hot and in spite\
  \ of it we managed to stubbornly keep going \u2013 second mistake - until our first\
  \ planned destination, Ponte de Lima. We were getting exhausted beyond reason and\
  \ we had almost no physical preparation. The sights were becoming equal, we just\
  \ wanted to arrive and when the signs indicating \u201CPonte de Lima\u201D appeared\
  \ instead of relieve we felt frustration because a golf field was separating us\
  \ from our goal.  \nAfter 8 pm, Ponte de Lima. The refugee for pilgrims was full,\
  \ only the floor available at that point. We decided to ask around in some inns\
  \ whose main purpose is to host pilgrims in summer but no luck. It was then, when\
  \ we last expected, that some sort of Santiago miracle happened. The owner of one\
  \ of those inns\u2019s called a friend thinking she could have a room; and she did,\
  \ although in the outskirts of the centre. None the less, she picked us up in the\
  \ car, stopping purposely in a supermarket to buy us food. We were already so grateful,\
  \ but she surprised us even more: the room was in a beautiful villa, surrounded\
  \ by gorgeous flower gardens. She had no guests and simply left us at will, departing\
  \ with a sage advice \u201Cwe have to give, to receive back\u201D. We ended sleeping\
  \ like royalty, in big beds with comfy sheets, after making a deal with ourselves\
  \ to respect our bodies on the upcoming days."
