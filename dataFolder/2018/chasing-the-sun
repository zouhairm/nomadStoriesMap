Text: "When I decided to travel around northern Europe, my first stop was Copenhagen.\
  \ After living in London for a little while, I thought it was a bad idea to go yet\
  \ into another place where rain is reigning. I was proved wrong, because my life\
  \ changed the moment I stumbled upon the birthplace of happiness.\nThe rain was\
  \ there to wait for me, but as I was walking with my head buried under my umbrella,\
  \ I was captured by an unique smell. I told myself out loud: \"What is this witchcraft?\"\
  . I looked around and read \"Lagkagehuset\". I got inside and asked the girl working\
  \ there about that smell that lured me in, she looked at me smiling and said: Rugbr\xF8\
  d. I had some and I felt like I was home.\nI walked out of there singing, the road\
  \ became my muse as I randomly picked a street and moved forward. I couldn't take\
  \ a break from the excitement, I was stupefied by the view and felt an overwhelming\
  \ joy. I was looking at the colors, every part of the city was embroided with flowers.\
  \ Tulips and wild roses. \nAnd then it hit me. Copenhagen has a way of of calming\
  \ you down, it drowns all the negative vibes and it shows you that it is possible\
  \ to be happy, even in the rain. Copenhagen knows how to take care of you.\nThe\
  \ day after I took a bike, and as I was riding under a grey sky I was excited to\
  \ find out the secrets of such a hauntingly beautiful city. I stopped to see Assistens\
  \ Cemetery, I was told that it was no ordinary graveyard. It looks like heaven,\
  \ a green oasis where people can respectfully have a picnic, or just relax. They\
  \ somehow managed to transform a place of grief into a place of joy. Happiness is\
  \ a state of mind, they say. I guess they're right, I felt I wanted to die there.\
  \ I would have checked out of this world peacefully.\nAs the sun was surprisingly\
  \ showing up, I was headed towads the beach, and got ready for one more sm\xF8rrebr\xF8\
  d of emotions. I walked around, looking at the majestic wind turbines and I just\
  \ sat on a bench, looking at the quiet sea, at the wild ducks, and eveything was\
  \ breathtaking.  Everyone seemed to enjoy that little sun that I usually take for\
  \ granted. \nI never thought that I would leave my heart in that city. I never felt\
  \ so happy, I felt my whole life should be a love letter to Copenhagen. \nThe day\
  \ after I left for another northern country. I got a call from my sister, who was\
  \ booking my flight back and asked me if I wanted a direct flight. I smiled and\
  \ said: \"Please, get me a layover in Copenhagen, I need to buy the bread on my\
  \ way home.\""
