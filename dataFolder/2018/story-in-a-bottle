Text: "We hit a bump and I knock my head hard on the glass. The tumultuous road shoots\
  \ me from a revelry and into the present. I smile looking over my shoulder to the\
  \ tribe's sea of color and threads. It\u2019s my first day in Cusco and one of the\
  \ greatest festival days of the year, Pacha Mama. The antiquity is palpable in contrast\
  \ to the modern world I\u2019d occupied working in Buenos Aires. The smell of Pan\
  \ de Anis and sweet Coca tea fanned through the room as they gift me rainbow woven\
  \ and beaded festival garments they plan to sell at the Despacho ceremony. I give\
  \ them a Vote pin from the Dead show I\u2019d gone to that summer and we share the\
  \ language of a smile, wondering of each other\u2019s story. They also share with\
  \ me photos of where we\u2019re going, and their rituals and the chief stares at\
  \ a photo of his son greeting the Dali Lama on behalf of the Queros. Since then\
  \ his son has passed and with him another mouthpiece for the Quechua language and\
  \ the ancient wisdom it carries. \nWhen we finally arrive, I see the photo exalted\
  \ into life. Nature in her pristine form which is who we have come to honor today.\
  \ The chief leads us through the ceremony as my host Holly ushers her adopted son\
  \ Dante in closer to his grandpa to learn the ways of his ancestors. He laughs and\
  \ shows me a Snapchat he\u2019s taken of his dad with a thought bubble that reads\
  \ \u201CWork.\u201D The chief burns our offering to mix with the Spirit in the sky,\
  \ and I settle into the gratitude, watching the sparks fly as ancient and contemporary\
  \ Americas collide. The dogs begin to howl all around us as the smoke fills the\
  \ air and Holly explains to me it\u2019s because they see what we cannot. \nThe\
  \ intensity of the experience begins to roll into laughter as Dante wrestles with\
  \ my childhood friend who\u2019d been the introduction for today. Suddenly there\u2019\
  s a hard hit and a snap, as Dante\u2019s glasses break and Holly\u2019s face turns\
  \ white. My friend mirrors the concern as she assures him \u201C It\u2019s fine,\
  \ just a bad sign.\u201D On top of Dante's deafness, he is now going blind. Holly\
  \ and Dante's uphill journey through adoption and bringing a modern approach to\
  \ deaf rights in Peru has taken on a whole new incline. I send another thank you\
  \ to Pacha Mama for my senses and the connections to those I can share them with.\
  \ The ability to share our story is a gift often taken for granted, and as I take\
  \ it all in I make a promise to share and raise the voices of those who cannot."
