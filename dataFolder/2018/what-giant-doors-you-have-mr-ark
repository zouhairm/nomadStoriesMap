Text: It was overcast and the day was quite chilly. The bus ride from the ticket line
  to the actual grounds where the great Ark of the Creation Museum was a quite one.
  Quiet with anticipation. Anxiousness of what was to come. With me I traveled with
  my best friend as well as our exchange student. As the bus approaches the site,
  everyone looks out the windows of the bus and talk in hushed voices. Before us we
  a massive structure in the form of an Ark. The excitement starts to build in all
  of us as we are finally able to disembark the bus. For a time, we all stand at a
  distance, taking in the massive sight before us. It was a sight I would never forget.
  You read about the measurements of the Ark God told Noah to use for building it,
  but you fail to realize what that really means until you see it. After taking pictures,
  we make our way to the Ark. As we take the ramp leading up to the door of the Ark,
  we stop once we reach it. As if our breath hadn't been taken away already, we were
  in silent awe of the size of the doors. At least five, maybe six people across and
  too many to count high. What awaited beyond those doors were a sight to see and
  the surprises kept coming. One thing I will forever remember will be the enormous
  size of the Ark itself and the mightiness of it's doors.
