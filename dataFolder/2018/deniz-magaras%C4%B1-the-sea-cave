Text: "Among the tumbs of the lycean necropolis, I stood enjoying the sun and view\
  \ on the shimmering Mediterranean sea. In the distance layed islands of green and\
  \ one could look over the small village of Kalek\xF6y, anciently known as Simena,\
  \ and observe the port and its pleasure boats. \nOurs was the \xAB\_\xC7in 5\_\xBB\
  , I had slept in the cabin to its rocking and when I awoke, the captain, his wife\
  \ and me started preparing our day expedition. The spouses had indeed generously\
  \ accepted I come with them and sleep alone on the boat thanks to the recommendation\
  \ of a common friend. \nToday, the crew would wait until the boat filled with its\
  \ guests and head to distant coasts on the infamous turquoise coast.\n \xAB\_Iki\
  \ kahve, l\xFCtfen\_!\xBB to the sound of deep house music I had started serving\
  \ turkish coffee and tea. While chatting with the families and couples, we sailed\
  \ on the sunken city of Kekova roads just like pirates centuries ago. \nAs jolly\
  \ as dolphins we had swum through different streams, sometimes reaching shivering\
  \ cold ones. Some dived, others jumped from the top deck of the boat. There was\
  \ laughter, exploration, and calm and peace.  The blue cruise came to an end as\
  \ unexpectedly as it started with a song glorifying Mustafa Kemal Atat\xFCrk, hero\
  \ of the turkish nation, cheering in the air. \nThe anchor was let down and one\
  \ by one each vanished into the port of Demre. There remained  Yusuf, the captain,\
  \ two of his friends and me. \nAsking what the next step is isn\u2019t the best\
  \ idea on a holiday adventure\_; sometimes you just have to go with the flow. The\
  \ \xC7in departed and nobody spoke anymore. It was time to relax, silence was key;\
  \ the wind and the waves would do the talking. Everybody in a daze, barefooted and\
  \ watching the horizon. \nSoon, the sun would set and the demons would come out.\
  \ Spirits of damned children were indeed said to roam around at midnight in a neighboring\
  \ island\u2019s cemetery. \nThose weren\u2019t the demons I was talking about. I\
  \ would join the live ones at a full moon party on the beach later on.\nAnd so we\
  \ went and danced but the best was yet to come. \n\xAB\_Do you want to go to the\
  \ sea cave\_?\_\xBB. I need not specify my answer. In the darkness, I drove a jetski\
  \ for the first time following his indications. We jumped in the water, it was warm,\
  \ black and bottomless. Thrilled I swam nervously in the deep, discovering with\
  \ surprise that noctiluca scintillans or \xAB\_sea sparkles\xBB surrounded us. This\
  \ type of algae produced light with each of my movements\_: I was swimming among\
  \ the stars."
