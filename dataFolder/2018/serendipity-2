Text: "Saturday, 3:56 pm I started the engine of my rented car, the GPS voice was\
  \ my only travel buddy at the moment. Destination: Navarra Forest, little did I\
  \ know by that time how that forest would surprise me the following day.  Loud music,\
  \ MORAT, a Colombian band who became my best companions for the whole drive. The\
  \ ecstasy that invaded every inch of my thoughts assured me that I would be finding\
  \ my essence, the one that got lost some time ago, through the years. As I was driving\
  \ I spotted a lonely yet, green tree so I stopped and spent a while looking at it,\
  \ maybe looking myself in the mirror, alone in the middle of a goldish field, I\
  \ took a picture of that beautiful contrast of colours and emotions and kept driving.\
  \ I barely realized the nightfall when I found myself in the middle of a dark road\
  \ where only the wind made himself visible. After more than 5 hours driving tiredness\
  \ overwhelmed me so I stopped the car in front of an abandoned farm where nothing\
  \ could be seen, no sound could be heard although I had a creepy feeling. I started\
  \ the engine again and kept driving the road upwards, finally, I found a platform\
  \ where loads of cars were parked as if they were waiting for me. I fell asleep\
  \ in the blink of an eye with the music of the cows\xB4 bells that were surrounding\
  \ my car in the background. Next day a group of horses woke me up to the most breathtaking\
  \ foggy sunrise. One of the horses even tried to take a bite of my white car, at\
  \ least I was safe.  The adventure was awaiting. I had no map so I started talking\
  \ to my neighbours from the caravans. When travelling alone, I always see the people\
  \ as friends that I had to meet them at some point in my life. I arrived at the\
  \ Iraty Forest where I met a couple at some point of the route, we shared a few\
  \ impressions including our corresponding starting points, which later I would find\
  \ out they were not the same even if according to the description they were. Darkness\
  \ came and I finished the route yet at the wrong side of the forest. I was alone\
  \ and lost. I made two friends at that very moment, who drove me for more than one\
  \ hour back to my car. I had been saved. Monday came and following my caravan\xB4\
  s friends advice I climbed a peak. Up there was really windy yet comforting. Back\
  \ down I met a French family who recommended me to visit Larrau, a village, 10km\
  \ away, so I went for it.  My rusty French aided me to book a room in a very familiar,\
  \ rustic and special hotel, where after two nights sleeping in the car I found paradise."
