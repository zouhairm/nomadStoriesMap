Text: "Since I was 12 years old, I always dreamed of fulfilling my great dream of\
  \ traveling abroad to learn other languages \u200B\u200Band to know a new culture,\
  \ but the financial situation of my family has never allowed me. Even more than\
  \ 20 years later I never forgot this dream that ended up becoming a life project.\n\
  In 2015 after much planning I managed to mark my long dreamed trip abroad that could\
  \ not have been better than to know the beautiful Amsterdam capital of the low countries\
  \ known by its beautiful people, welcoming that only on my arrival did confirm what\
  \ I imagined. Beautiful landscapes that I could meet easily and cheaply mounted\
  \ on a simple bicycle that accompanied me in my crossings through several cities\
  \ pedaling more each new place had my strength renewed and not wanted the song of\
  \ the long trips.\n\_Finding my aunts who live in this beautiful place helped me\
  \ to get from north to south of Holland and still had the opportunity to get to\
  \ know southern Switzerland and northern Germany.\nEven after 2 years of this trip\
  \ I still look at my photos and it is as if it had been yesterday and that chest\
  \ pain to have left my new friends and family back to my return in Brazil and minimized\
  \ by the strong memories of this beautiful experience that I lived."
