Text: "The heat from the midday sun is like a slap on the face, and I dodge quickly\
  \ under a grey tiled roof to escape the blistering rays. A familiar smell wafts\
  \ from behind the counter. Hungry from walking, I sit down at a table towards the\
  \ back.\n\nA pair of middle-aged men with tanned skin are seated two tables in front\
  \ of me. One is facing me, wearing a faded apron, slumped against the corner of\
  \ the table. Noticing me, he plods over, smiling.\n\n\u201CDo you have Khao Soi\
  \ Gai? One please.\u201D I say, in halting Thai. He nods and disappears into the\
  \ kitchen. He returns with a bowl of wavy egg noodle in curry broth with chicken.\
  \ As I dig in, I notice the broth is a pastel yellow instead of the mustard colour\
  \ I\u2019m accustomed to seeing.\n\nAfter I finish, he asks me if it was delicious.\
  \ I nod my head.\n\u201CIt\u2019s not spicy, is it?\u201D\n\u201CActually, I like\
  \ it spicy. I\u2019m from Singapore.\u201D\n\u201CSingapore, ah, the bright red\
  \ passport, I see.\u201D\n\nI look down at my bowl, wondering what the broth would\
  \ have tasted like had we had this conversation earlier.\n\nSince the 2012 Chinese\
  \ blockbuster \u2018Lost in Thailand\u2019 featured Chiang Mai, the number of Chinese\
  \ tourists here has tripled. Reducing the spiciness of dishes is one way locals\
  \ have accommodated to these visitors. \n\nWith my button nose, dark eyes and \u2018\
  yellow skin\u2019- a colloquial mandarin term referring to one being of Chinese\
  \ ethnicity, I could be mistaken for a Thai Chinese or a tourist from mainland China.\
  \ Occasions I\u2019ve been mistaken for the former, I\u2019ve always relished with\
  \ glee - It\u2019s an honour to gain access to the secret world of locals as an\
  \ \u2018insider\u2019, and be associated with the gentle demeanour and high tolerance\
  \ of differences, characteristic of Thais - 'Jai Yen\u2019 (cool heart), and \u2018\
  Mai Pen Rai\u2019 (no problem) their ethos. Conversely, since news broke of a Chinese\
  \ national defecating in Chiang Mai\u2019s ancient moat, and another drying her\
  \ underwear using the hand dryer in Chiang Mai International Airport, being mistaken\
  \ for the latter has become a source a chagrin.\n \n\u201CWhat\u2019s the weather\
  \ like in Singapore?\u201D\n\u201CIt\u2019s hot all year round, like here, right\
  \ now,\u201D I smile. At this, he gets up abruptly, disappearing into the kitchen\
  \ again. He reappears shortly, holding a cup of iced water, and sets it in front\
  \ of me.\n\u201CIt\u2019s hot.\u201D He gestures outside.\n\nAs I drink, I notice\
  \ the unfinished broth in my bowl has formed layers, with trails of fiery-red surfacing\
  \ above the yellow. \nLike Khao Soi, because identity comprises of layers, I will\
  \ always traverse both sides."
