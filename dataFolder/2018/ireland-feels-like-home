Text: "Ireland just feels like home. Although I'm certainly not the first human being\
  \ to ever utter the phrase (And God willing, I won't be the last) in this moment,\
  \ I feel as though I could be the very most sincere. Ireland feels like home. I'm\
  \ supposed to be here. Right now. As I watch the sunrise over the river Liffey,\
  \ filled with a sense of belonging and purpose that I've never before experienced.\
  \ \n\nAnd though I'm sure many a wise man has found himself drunk, it is a far reach\
  \ to say many a drunk have found themselves wise. That being said, I will tell you\
  \ here now, I am the former and not the latter.\n\n'Ireland just feels like home.'\
  \ It's a phrase rightfully suited for tourist's T-shirts and coffee mugs. Something\
  \ akin to; \"Virginia is for lovers\" or \"Seattle never sleeps\".  Certainly a\
  \ trademark that ought to be coupled along side little shitty leprechauns and Guinness\
  \ merchandise, rather than displayed in some serious statement about a cauterizing\
  \ moment in a man's life. But as I sit here in between the silent pauses of the\
  \ rain, staring over Saint Stephen's Green, serenity has a new definition.\n\nDublin.\
  \  It is not the place of my heritage nor somewhere that anyone could pinpoint an\
  \ origin of any deep rooted, or long-standing family tradition. There is no tempered\
  \ lover earnestly awaiting me on her Emerald Shores, no real reason that I would\
  \ need to seek refuge amongst these humble people of the River Liffey. Believe me,\
  \ I completely understand that I have no business inserting myself into the perennial\
  \ narrative unfolding here underneath the shadow of the pointless point; which keeps\
  \ a watchful eye over the cobbled stone of O'Connell street. And yet, I still yearn\
  \ to be there with her. \n\nIt's an altogether vague yet powerful feeling. It's\
  \ much like the carefree cascade of fading concern, discovered on a Friday night,\
  \ with the top down, the warm wind gently caressing your face... Embracing the knowledge\
  \ that you have nothing else to do, no where else to go, and no other responsibility\
  \ to fulfill other than focusing  on the now. You can almost literally see the concept\
  \ of freedom being redefined in your mind, renewed and rewritten in each passing\
  \ second. A revolution of perception. You can taste it.\n\nTo me, this is Ireland.\
  \ A blissful ache that makes your heart swell within your chest....\n\nAnd I tell\
  \ you this because, amongst her self deprecating, beautiful people I found a glimmer\
  \ of something I thought I had lost here in Ireland. And it means everything."
