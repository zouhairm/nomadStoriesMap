Text: "The Photography Museum in the Medina is one of Marrakech's main tourist draws,\
  \ and Rob and I had been there when we had first started dating. It seemed fitting\
  \ somehow, now that we had divorced, to be back here, full circle. I stood at the\
  \ entrance and my stomach grumbled loudly. Donkeys and motorcycles whirring by,\
  \ caked with dirt, diesel fumes high in the air; people and sandals and djellabas\
  \ dusty from the hot, dry, red earth. A palette of reds, oranges, browns and greens,\
  \ like a Degas painting without all the tutus. Little blue tiles suddenly stood\
  \ out, caught my eye. It was a tiny little makeshift tiled kitchen with six men\
  \ seated on a teeny tiny little bench, hunched over and eating. As I moved closer\
  \ one of the patrons on the bench popped up, gobbled up what remained of his meal\
  \ and motioned for me to sit. Before I could say anything, the owner poured me a\
  \ little bowl of soup and handed me a day-old pita. I opened my hand and revealed\
  \ a fistful of Moroccan change, and the patron carefully picked out a 5 dirham coin\
  \ and handed it to the owner, who smiled. \n\nThe soup was delicious. It was a chick\
  \ pea puree, sprinkled with cayenne pepper and drizzled generously with olive oil,\
  \ and the pita, when submerged, suddenly found new life as a soft and fluffy cloud\
  \ in my mouth. It was warm and nurturing, and when I had cleared my bowl, the owner\
  \ signaled if I wanted a little more, and brushed my offer of money aside when I\
  \ handed it to him. \n\n\u201CAmerican?\u201D the patron who had given me his place\
  \ and was now behind me asked. \n\n\u201CCanadian\u201D I responded, as energetically\
  \ as I could muster. \n\n\u201CWelcome welcome. You been to Marrakech before?\u201D\
  \n\n\u201CI have, yes, many years ago. With my\u2026 um\u2026\u201D I paused and\
  \ stood awkwardly, my voice trailing off. \n\nHe just looked right at me, stood\
  \ completely still, and when I managed finally look at him, he lifted up his arm,\
  \ the sleeve of his kaftan long and gently moving with the breeze that was constantly\
  \ flowing through the Medina, and laid his hand on my shoulder. \n\n\u201CEvery\
  \ rose has a thorn as its friend.\u201D\n\nI felt a gentle squeeze on my shoulder,\
  \ and he lowered his arm, nodded, and turned around, walking away from the bench,\
  \ from me, and into the swarm of souks and merchants that lay before him. I watched\
  \ him disappear, watched the top of his knitted cap as it got smaller and smaller,\
  \ meandering and bobbing into the distance until it was nothing and I could no longer\
  \ distinguish it from the flurry of movements and colours around it."
