Text: "Twas the wake. We were three Kerrymen, a father, and his two sons, in the Kingdom\
  \ known as Kerry, Ireland. After a full day\u2019s trek through rolling landscapes,\
  \ emphasized by the remote beauty of the Black Valley, we secured permission from\
  \ a local farmer to make a shelter on his land and settled in for the night. \n\n\
  We were cold from the September rain which was relentless and sideways, our bodies\
  \ sore and thoroughly knackered. In need of warmer spirits, the smooth caramel taste\
  \ of the whiskey quickly soothed the knots loosened our tongues. Our toasts to Paddy\
  \ Tangney, the late Kerryman, and my father's uncle, began with a silent nod and\
  \ were accompanied by stories of my father\u2019s childhood in Kerry during the\
  \ 60's and 70\u2019s. \n\n\u201CIt was a time that was altogether unforgiving, adventurous,\
  \ hard and full of life. A time for pioneers, like Paddy, who boarded a steamer\
  \ bound for New York in 1962. He gave me the courage to follow suit a decade later.\
  \ Slainte!\u201D my father proclaimed, raising his tin mug slightly from a seated\
  \ position on a cold, slippery stone. Paddy\u2019s wanderlust provided him the fortunes\
  \ that he was seeking, though it meant unintended consequences for his younger brother\
  \ Bill who purchased the farm from him at his mother\u2019s behest.\n\n\u201CGiven\
  \ his proclivity for politics and the local social, he never wanted the farm. But\
  \ fair to him, he gave it a go. Though nothing was ever good enough, including the\
  \ father-son relationship that ensued,\u201D continued my father. His undertone\
  \ told of Bill\u2019s relentless rule of law on the farm. It must have been the\
  \ pain of nostalgia that pried opened the wounds of his past now remembered.\n\n\
  Regrettably, the only memory I have of Bill is on his deathbed. I was ten, and my\
  \ bother two years my senior. We stood solemnly and said our goodbyes, daring not\
  \ to look directly at the stiff figure before us, averting our eyes downward to\
  \ the plaid patterned rug or above to the cross hanging over his bedside. Bill\u2019\
  s passing marked the end of the contentious relationship between my father and grandfather.\
  \ Though, it died long before then, far away from dreary old rural Ireland.\n\n\
  As the night wound down, it was clear to me that the Kerrymen's wake, complete with\
  \ the drink, laughter, and shared memories, had transpired into something more than\
  \ a celebration of Paddy's life. Out of death came closure, forgiveness and a strengthened\
  \ bond between father and son, bore through harsh truths and fond memories of the\
  \ people of Kerry, both past, and present."
