Text: "June 2015\nFell in love with a love, who went travelling.\nNever travelled\
  \ before, she had no experience, didn\u2019t know what to expect. \nShe was a home\
  \ grown girl, family driven, close.\nSo her travelling was a big step to find herself...\n\
  She was scared, anxious, bold, brave.\n\nAug 2015 \nPerseids Meteor Shower, me and\
  \ my best friend, beers, blankets & a whole field of the racecourse to sit in. Build\
  \ on old roman race course, fitting we watch something as far as time goes to watch\
  \ natures most illuminating shower.\nI sent invite to see if she would join... hoping,\
  \ praying. Amazing when in the middle of the night I hear her voice call me out\
  \ that made my heart jump.\nWe watched all night, taken back by each shooting star.\n\
  \nSept 2015\nShe flys. She disappears. Gone to find that missing part of herself,\
  \ ironic. She took the object that made me fee incomplete. Her.\n\nOct 2015\nKnowing\
  \ her birthday was coming up in Nov and she was going to be in Thailand, I made\
  \ plans to chase a star....\n\nNov 2015 \nNot much planning and going of the beat\
  \ of my heart... I chased, got on a plane and found her on the other side of the\
  \ world. Same stars. Same sunrise, same sundown, same sky, same air.... yet the\
  \ feeling of difference. People. Culture. Noise.\nI surprised her with a message,\
  \ saying wish upon a star....\nShe replied and said I wish you to be here for my\
  \ birthday....\nOn the night of Full Moon, amongst the thousands of people, all\
  \ walks of life, the sight of a curly haired beauty with the most amazing smile...\
  \ a smile you could start your day with. A smile that would be the last thing you\
  \ think of.\nHer wish for me to be there ...\nMy wish to give her a present for\
  \ her travels...\nA necklace, with a star pendant.... with a message - remember\
  \ if you feel lost, alone, you will always be looking at the same sky, same stars.\
  \ And if you ever want to come home... follow your North Star.\nAnd if you want\
  \ to make a wish, you will always have a star to wish on."
