Text: "There is a coconut stand I passed each morning on my way to my favourite caf\xE9\
  \ in Hua Hin, Thailand. One morning, I approached the woman behind the stand, who\
  \ welcomed me with the widest smile.\n\nShe took one of the bigger coconuts and\
  \ made a few cuts around the top with a knife to create an opening for the straw.\n\
  \n\u201CYou always look so happy with your big smile. It\u2019s so nice to see you\
  \ every morning!\u201D I told her.\n\nWith sparkling eyes, she served me a fresh\
  \ coconut and asked me where I was going.\n\n\u201CTo the caf\xE9 around the corner,\
  \ \u2018Ob-oon.\u201D \n\n\u201COh, I know this place!\u201D she said excitedly.\
  \ \u201CI used to work in that hotel.\u201D\n\n\u201CWhat did you do there?\u201D\
  \ I asked, knowing that the Caf\xE9 belongs to Putahracsa, a luxury five-star hotel\
  \ by the beach.\n\n\u201CI was a butler,\u201D she replied proudly, lifting her\
  \ head up a bit. \u201CNow I\u2019m taking care of my sick father. This is his coconut\
  \ stand,\u201D she explained, still with a big smile, as if life\u2019s hardships\
  \ didn\u2019t touch her at all. As if it\u2019s the most natural thing to quit a\
  \ job you love to take care of your sick father - no bitterness, no hesitation.\
  \ There was no sadness on her face. \n\nAs I walked towards my caf\xE9, my tears\
  \ started flowing. Not in an \u201CI feel sorry for this woman kind of way.\u201D\
  \ More like, \u201CI bow so deeply to this woman\u2019s strength and grace.\u201D\
  \ \n\nThe next few days, she was not there. Then, on my last day in Hua Hin, she\
  \ was finally back. \n\n\u201CSo good to see you again,\u201D I told her. \n\nShe\
  \ was happy to see me too, and told me she had to bring her dad to the hospital.\
  \ He was getting older and sicker. I wondered how old she was and if she had any\
  \ family of her own. She told me she was 44 and had never been in love.\n\n\u201C\
  Never? Not even once?\u201D I couldn\u2019t believe it. \n\n\u201CNever,\u201D she\
  \ confirmed. \u201CAnd now it\u2019s too late for me. It\u2019s too difficult here\
  \ in Thailand. Men always leave their wives and kids. I don\u2019t like that.\u201D\
  \n\n\u201CDid your dad leave your family when you were born?\u201D\n\n\u201CYes,\u201D\
  \ she said, and for the first time, her eyes reflected some sadness. \u201CHe had\
  \ to. He worked in Chiang Mai, in Northern Thailand. We barely saw him. Only during\
  \ holidays.\u201D\n\n \u201CWhat\u2019s your name?\u201D I asked her.\n\n\u201C\
  Geow,\u201D she said.\n\n\u201CWell, Geow, let me tell you. You, your beautiful\
  \ smile, and your graciousness have been the highlight of my trip. I hope you will\
  \ fall in love soon, it\u2019s never too late for that! It\u2019s the best feeling\
  \ in the world.\u201D\n\n\u201COh, thank you. Yes, I hope to fall in love. That\
  \ would be lovely,\u201D she agreed and gave me her widest smile yet."
