Text: "\u201CIf you could go anywhere in the world, where would that be?\u201D I asked\
  \ curiously as he steered the boat toward the world famous reef break. \n\nThat\
  \ days surfers jumped off at Cloudbreak while I stayed onboard sunbathing and he\
  \ cast his fishing line out. A smile grew across his face as the line tugged almost\
  \ instantaneously; the fish were clearly abundant out in the crystal clear waters.\
  \ It was the purest form of happiness I had witnessed and it stretched across his\
  \ face, swimming into the shape of his dark brown eyes. \u201CHave a go!\u201D he\
  \ said, prompting me toward the rod. \u201CWhy not!?\u201D\n\nEach day was the same.\
  \ Like that morning, he would be steering the boat toward the rising sun as the\
  \ night stars disappeared and the burnt orange glow peeped over the horizon catching\
  \ playful dolphins in its rays. He would sit with his line swimming in the pristine\
  \ Fijian waters that housed the most magical creatures I had seen. It was a rainbow\
  \ of beauty beneath the perfectly blue surface and, while I took a break from the\
  \ direct heat of the sun a sea turtle appeared beside me gliding graciously over\
  \ the reef below. \n\n\u201CWhat do you do with all these fish?\u201D I asked, pulling\
  \ myself out of the ocean onto the boat. He smiled and pointed to an island in the\
  \ distance. \u201CEat them of course! I take them home to my family\u201D. He shares\
  \ a small shack not larger than an average living room back home on an island adjacent\
  \ to the resort-filled one I was staying on. Each night as the moon pulled back\
  \ the tide until it was low enough to walk between the two islands, he would gather\
  \ the fish and make way for home. \n\nI laid down, my eyes hypnotised by the blank\
  \ blue canvas above. I imagined a day in his life. He owned little, his family unit\
  \ were close. He would fish for the nights feast and they worked hard in the harsh\
  \ rays of the sun for no more than the hourly wage at home. I felt a sense of guilt.\
  \ We had paid ten times the amount for the boat hire than he would receive. I wondered\
  \ how this place was only a two hour plane trip from my own home. A home I would\
  \ long to leave so often. \n\nMy thoughts were interrupted by the loud thud of a\
  \ surfboard hitting the hull. I sat up and watched the sun retire to the horizon.\
  \ It was time to return back to shore. Time for Dee to await the tide once again.\
  \ \n\nHe turned back to me, \u201Cwhy would I want to leave? Everyday I am so grateful\
  \ for my life; I live in paradise!\u201D, that same pure smile returning to his\
  \ cheeks. I couldn\u2019t disagree, after all, I was in paradise."
