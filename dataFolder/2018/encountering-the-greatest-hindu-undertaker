Text: "\u201CI see them! The tigers on the rooftop!\u201D I exclaimed, as I rushed\
  \ to get a closer look at the ornate, weather-beaten ceramic beasts snarling with\
  \ muted fierceness at the holy Ganges. \n\n\u201CThe Dom Raja\u2019s house! I dare\
  \ say we try and get a closer look,\u201D I urged my companion, as we started our\
  \ breathless climb up the tiny hillock on a scorching afternoon in Banaras, towards\
  \ the dilapidated mansion perched atop \u2013 the home of the greatest undertaker\
  \ of the Hindu kingdom. \n\nThe Dom Raja \u2013 a title that translates to 'King\
  \ of the Untouchable Cast\u2019 \u2013 is what the Hindus call the leader of the\
  \ century-old caste considered to be gatekeepers of the dead. Shunned to the lowest\
  \ pecking order of the caste-system, their only permissible job is that of cremating\
  \ the dead.\n\nFinding the front door ajar, we audaciously walked into the forbidden\
  \ home, passing a slothful buffalo while a few children idled shirtless in the sun.\_\
  \n\n\u201CDo you realise we\u2019re trespassing?\u201D I whispered to my friend.\
  \ \u201CI say we take a chance,\u201D my partner-in-crime quipped back. The thrill\
  \ of a chance encounter with the ring-leader of the Mafia of the Dead was hard to\
  \ pass up. \n\nAfter what seemed like eons, a swarthy, rotund man clad in a white\
  \ loin-cloth appeared. \u201CWe were hoping to meet the Dom Raja,\u201D I muttered,\
  \ expecting to be chased out with an outburst of profanity. Instead, he responded\
  \ with a beaming smile that exposed two gold incisors.\u201CThat\u2019s me.\u201D\
  \ \n\nWhat followed was an enthusiastic introduction to his sprawling family and\
  \ over a leisurely cup of tea, the Dom Raja answered our burning questions on the\
  \ curse of his ancestry.\n\n\u201CThe cremation ground is my kingdom,\u201D he explained\
  \ wistfully. \u201CWe have been the keepers of the torch that lights every funeral\
  \ pyre in the Hindu kingdom for centuries. At some point, every Hindu must use the\
  \ sacred fire from my\_hearth to liberate himself from the vicious cycle of life\
  \ and death.\u201D\n\nThe Dom Raja reeked of cheap country liquor. He admitted that\
  \ being inebriated was the only way to cope with the stench of dead bodies.\n\n\u201C\
  Do you know what I want?\u201D he ruminated. \u201CI want\_freedom from this job.\
  \ But this is my\_destiny, my prison. I hate this work, but my family has to eat.\u201D\
  \n\nHe was emotional and defiant. \u201CI will die. You will die. But I have the\
  \ same blood as you. I feel the same pain.\u201D\n\nAn utterly sad paradox for a\
  \ man needed but shunned by everyone. \n\nGrateful for a visit from the outside\
  \ world, he coaxed us to visit again. \u201CWatching the Ganges is beautiful from\
  \ up here!\u201D"
