Text: "I can\u2019t believe where we are right now and what happened in the last six\
  \ days. We are homeless on a random street in New Zealand after going through a\
  \ crazy adventure during the last week.\nI had just arrived in the country with\
  \ more sheep than people a week ago and my first experience was meant to be a very\
  \ extraordinary one. I decided to do voluntary work at a permaculture farm and I\
  \ absolutely didn\u2019t know what was about to happen to me. Permaculture aims\
  \ to live in a sustainable way by using resources such as water and energy efficiently\
  \ and sustainably at the same time. This meant we had to reduce our consumption\
  \ of these resources. Nevertheless, the concept at this farm was of a different\
  \ kind. It was a crazy one:\nAt the beginning everything seemed to be amazing. Unfortunately,\
  \ this didn\u2019t last long and gradually things started to be weird. Firstly,\
  \ the other volunteer and me, we were not allowed to clean our plates, but instead\
  \ we were expected to leave them dirty on the table for days. Secondly, we were\
  \ not allowed to let any water go through the sink, but instead catch the water\
  \ in a bowl and use it to flush the toilet. Thirdly, we only \u201Cshowered\u201D\
  \ in the river which was close by. And on top of that, we did not produce any plastic\
  \ waste at all!\nSome rules at this place shocked me. To me they seemed to be very\
  \ extreme. However, we enjoyed our time, especially the breaks to explore the nature\
  \ paradise that surrounded the farm. \nThen the day came when everything changed:\
  \ We got up like every morning to get ready for work. The atmosphere was different\
  \ though, we could feel it. Soon we found out why. The crazy owner just kicked us\
  \ out. \u201CYou have to leave\u201D, is the only thing he said without giving us\
  \ any reasons. This is what we did: We quickly packed and grabbed our backpacks,\
  \ stole some nice hats and some fruits and left the place that was meant to be our\
  \ home for one more week. \nFinally, here we are, sitting on a street in the middle\
  \ of nowhere, in shock and homeless. We are waiting for a car to pick us up. Step\
  \ by step the shock transforms into a smile and then into laughter, bursting laughter.\
  \ We can't stop. \nNow in the aftermath I have to admit that I learnt so much from\
  \ that experience, not only regarding sustainability and farm work, but also about\
  \ life in general. Sometimes the unexpected things are the best ones, because they\
  \ lead you to a journey into the unknown. This crazy adventure leads us into the\
  \ unknown next one."
