Text: "The engine of the bullet 350 roared and off we went. The warm sticky air blasted\
  \ through my hair like a hairdryer and relieved the dampness of my dewy skin as\
  \ we rode through and left behind our starting destination and meeting point, Cherai\
  \ Beach.\n\nWho would have thought that three months ago, a right swipe on Tinder\
  \ would have landed me here; my the first time in India with a man I barely knew\
  \ but instinctively and intuitively trusted. It seemed hard to believe we had only\
  \ met three times in the space of ten days, and after a few months of separation\
  \ we were beginning our journey of exploring India on a vintage motorbike for our\
  \ reunion. This really was the last thing I expected.\n\nLocals turned as they heard\
  \ the distinctive roar of the iconic engine and arms waved as their eyes located\
  \ our Royal Enfield, the country's most loved motorbike gleaming in the sun. Faces\
  \ split open into smiles and cried when they saw us. I waved back, feeling a pure\
  \ sense of uncontainment. A group of boys and a village dog lauded playfully, trying\
  \ to run after us.\n\nThrough the local village, our nostrils became barricaded\
  \ with a reeking stench of backlogged water and sewage. Five seconds later, the\
  \ warm concoction of garam masala spices overpowered. We whipped through a throng\
  \ of trees, and our nostrils were greeted with the aromatic scent of coconuts. \"\
  Aaaaaah!!\" we both groaned in unison after we could no longer smell the fruit.\
  \ This sensory experience on our first motorbike ride was already reflecting the\
  \ unpredictability of what was yet to come.\n\nWe had no idea how well we will get\
  \ along, with no plan, just spontonaeity and a month of adventure ahead of us. We\
  \ were at the mercy of India and how she was going to test us. \n\nHe momentarily\
  \ leant his head back, \"you know what people say about India?\" as we sped inbetween\
  \ the expansive mangrove lined backwaters of Alappuzha. \"That when you go for the\
  \ first time, you never come back quite the same. And it usually takes about six\
  \ months for you to really see that change.\"\n\n\"Do you think that will happen\
  \ to me after this trip?\"\n\n\"For sure, but we can double check in sixth months'\
  \ time.\" He turned to face me with a cheeky smile, eyes twinkling. I knew what\
  \ he meant. Even though we barely knew each other, there was a feeling that in six\
  \ months we would still be talking to each other. \n\nI nodded back, head and body\
  \ bobbing from a combination of excitement and the impact from battling on the bumpy\
  \ dirt road."
