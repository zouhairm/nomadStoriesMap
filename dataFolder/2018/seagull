Text: "4am at the lobby of this newly opened motel I was waiting for sun to come out,\
  \ Why? Because for a meek city girl like me who don\u2019t even go out after 9pm,\
  \ it was an absurd idea.\nThe idea was to get holy water from Prayag, Allahabad\
  \ before the sunrise as i was told by my mother. Prayag is the integration point\
  \ of three holiest rivers of India- Ganga, Yamuna and already extinct Saraswati.\n\
  Our departure was around 11am and i was already turned down by my two sleepy co-workers.\n\
  \nI look at him and try to hide my uncomforting thoughts, but he wasn\u2019t buying\
  \ it.\n\n\u201Cma\u2019am, it\u2019s not that far, and this Rickshawala will take\
  \ you there..i know him personally.\u201D Night manager at desk said.\n\n\u201C\
  \ umm..you said 30min?\u201D \nHe nodded. He could see how badly I wanted to do\
  \ this.\n\n \u201C but you said I have to take bus or e-Rickshaw from there too\
  \ right?\u201D\n\n\u201C yes, but you will find that easily, I'll ask him to arrange\
  \ that for you.\u201C his voice was very convincing for my terrified soul.\nSo This\
  \ was the time for the ultimate question. I looked into his eye for the truth and\
  \ spilled it.\n\u201C...is it safe for girls to be out at this time in this area?\u201D\
  \ \nGod! I am so embarrassed now. \n\u201C yes ma\u2019am, don\u2019t worry\u201D\
  \ his tone was even.\n\nSo there I was, in the middle of Ganga, biggest river of\
  \ India, in this worn out boat. little air bubbles in the sole of it were mocking\
  \ my guts. Prayers and that seagulls feeding were my only distraction from the idea\
  \ of drowning in it.\n No judgments please, I can't swim. Feeding seagulls as suggested\
  \ by the boatman.\n\n\u201C it\u2019s an auspicious ritual ma\u2019am. You are feeding\
  \ souls of your ancestors\u201D He tried to add more meaning in this holy experience.\n\
  \nThe journey to the middle was horrifying but the sunrise was my prize for this\
  \ self defining act.while returning to shore the boatman broke the hypnosis i was\
  \ in.\n\n\u201Cpicture?\u201C\n\nOh! Yeah. I took my camera that I didn\u2019t realized\
  \ I had with me this whole time. Bronze coloured sunrise was getting more precious\
  \ as it was turning into gold with every passing seconds. Seagulls were floating\
  \ in water as some monk does with their troubling thoughts, while mediating.\n\n\
  This is how i remember that mid morning adventure of my first independent travels\
  \ although my friends and family remembers it in the terms of those 1500 rupees\
  \ I spent on private boat where anyone can ride it with sharing in just 50 rupees.\
  \ I decided not to add that I spent 2000 rupees on a guide too, after seeing stunned\
  \ face of that night manager."
