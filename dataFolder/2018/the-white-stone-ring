Text: "Sailing along the Amazon river my feet were pointing at the sky, it was my\
  \ first time into the lest popular place to visit in South America: the lung of\
  \ the word, The jungle. The Amazonia jungle extends to Colombia, Brazil and Per\xFA\
  . \n\nI left Bogot\xE1, suddenly for eternal minutes without notion of the time\
  \ my canoe was standing over the three borders, my eyes were open like a black hole,\
  \ my body must be deriving its energy, it was me, somebody looking for life. \n\n\
  The little waves of the water rocked me all the way until I was settle in the Peruvian\
  \ jungle. Those who received me in their house to stay over during 10 days it was\
  \ the Tikuna natives. Their house was on the river, it seem a floating house in\
  \ the paradise. An entire family, many animals and Itat\xED were my light.\n\nI\
  \ felt observed when Itat\xED which means: \"White stone\", was looking at my and\
  \ my stuff, her face was shining of amazement because everything for her about me\
  \ was new. She didn\xB4t know it happened the same to me. Itat\xED was 15, during\
  \ the days she took me for a walk to see tarantulas, she taught to me how to catch\
  \ a fish, she showed to me the medicine from the trees, she did handmade works with\
  \ me, she cultivated and collected in front of me, she took me at nights in the\
  \ canoe to look for crocs and she put a Anaconda on my shoulders, I was scare but\
  \ I didn\xB4t care because I believed in her. \n\nItat\xED was shy and I was like\
  \ a arqueologist looking for scraps of life. Then I got it, I filled my memory with\
  \ each word she told to me. Her eyes was pure but I noticed sadness, so my imprudent\
  \ heart asked to her \xBFIs there a broken piece inside of you? she told to me her\
  \ cosmovision is so connected to the universe that she feels everything is happening\
  \ in the earth: attempts of colonizing, violence, companies trying to take their\
  \ territory, the indifferent governments, famine, wars, genocide against native\
  \ peoples, stolen lands.... a lot of gunshots for my soul. \n\nEvery minute there\
  \ I felt the greatest person ever. I got completely out of my comfort zone, I naked\
  \ my mind and I opened my heart to the nature. The Tikunas live from the earth,\
  \ they sleep in a hammock, they use the fire as a light, they eat dinner at a wooden\
  \ board so I could see their shadows. They take a bath in the river and the animals\
  \ are their bathroom mates. \n\nItat\xED: \xBFHow is your life? \nMe: my life isn\xB4\
  t nothing else than this moment with you. I came here to explore your community\
  \ from which I learned. Look at my hand \xBFDo you like my white stone ring?"
