Text: "As soon as I stepped out of the airplane I could feel the sun kissing my skin\
  \ for the first time in what felt like forever. Living in the UK has its many wonders,\
  \ but my tropical blood longs for the warmth of the higher temperatures. That longing\
  \ is what drove me to book a sort of last minute flight to Spain in search of a\
  \ recharging quick holiday. \nOn my way to the hostel I felt the familiar yet forgotten\
  \ sensation of sweat dripping down my brow. A nuisance in any other context, but\
  \ right now a source of pure joy. \nI had just enough time to settle in and go for\
  \ a quick bite before leaving for my night dive. I had booked this dive online,\
  \ as it was one of the few companies that did them at night, and I was told I would\
  \ get picked up at my hostel. As I was waiting outside, I see a white van approach,\
  \ and a blond man coming out of it. I suddenly realised that being picked up to\
  \ go inside a stranger's van by myself in a foreign country is probably not the\
  \ way my mother would've liked me to go about my holidays, but I got in nonetheless.\n\
  A bit awkward at first, we start chatting a it to fill the 20-minute drive to the\
  \ diving site, and it turns out he is the owner of not only the dive shop but also\
  \ the bar next door to it. As conversation got more relaxed and we started to get\
  \ along, he casually asks me if I happen to have any bar workk experience, as he\
  \ is looking for a new bartender. Well, it just so happens that's what I do for\
  \ a living, and he just couldn't believe it. He basically offered me a job in sunny\
  \ Mallorca, but I didn't take it too seriously. \nWe pick up one more person who\
  \ is diving with us and go about our adventure. It was a fantastic experience, and\
  \ he invites us to come over to his bar afterwards for a few drinks. Used to travelling\
  \ alone, I hadn't made any plans for the evening, and I went along even though I\
  \ had another dive at 8am next morning. After many pints and chatting for a few\
  \ hours he asks me if I will take the job. I realise he was serious and I find myself\
  \ actually entertaining the idea of moving to Spain. \nThe bar is closed now, but\
  \ a few of us are still inside. Perks of being friends with the boss. It is 4am\
  \ and I stop to contemplate where I find myself and how I never would have imagined\
  \ my night would turn out like this. I have not only made new friends and amazing\
  \ memories, but have an exciting job proposal in my hands. I guess that'll give\
  \ me something to think about on my long bus ride back to my hostel."
