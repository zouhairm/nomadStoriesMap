Text: "Coming from Rwanda, a small landlocked country in Africa, it never occurred\
  \ to me that I would make it to the Antarctic. \n\nAs I child I would often contemplate\
  \ the world map hanging in my room and would imagine myself travelling and discovering\
  \ other continents. Yet, Antarctica always felt inaccessible by my beliefs. Isolated\
  \ at the bottom of the Earth, not much to see a sort of a harsh no man's land. \n\
  \nWhen I became an adult, I started travelling and my idea of going to Antarctic\
  \ emboldened. Nonetheless a far-fetched dream. Going to Antarctic symbolized the\
  \ things I dreaded the most; a hostile, barren, cold, dangerous, inhospitable and\
  \ remote environment. The adventure and explorer bug in me was yearning to unearth\
  \ its secrets.\n\nSailing for the first three days across the sea with no land insight,\
  \ our vessel was surrounded by rolling mountains of water which blocked out the\
  \ horizon. The frequent visits of Albatrosses, Petrels coupled with sightings of\
  \ a few mammals kept me on deck. I would sit there watching an albatross gliding\
  \ on the sea surface, using its wingtip to make a trail on the wave edge like a\
  \ surfer surfing beneath a wave pipe. Subsequently the albatross would soar up,\
  \ do a few circles in patterns like it had a specific direction to go to and dive\
  \ down again. All this would happen without a single flap from its wings, I was\
  \ simply blown away. I would often wonder if any of those physics could be applied\
  \ on our everyday life. \n\nLife onboard was quite thrilling. With the frequent\
  \ sway of the boat created by the huge swells, the body was constantly in motion\
  \ and it felt like being in a salsa class. Waking up in the early mornings to try\
  \ and spot my first icebergs after a rough night sleep was quite challenging yet\
  \ exciting. \nI had seen ice and snow in my first winter in Europe, but nothing\
  \ could prepare me for an encounter with an imposing, hostile and threating field\
  \ of Icebergs. Razor sharp, pointed like the edges of sword, towering sometime twice\
  \ the size of our boat, these behemoths made me feel so small and insignificant.\n\
  \nI often recalled myself standing on the deck and trying to understand my feelings\
  \ of being down in Antarctica. The natural dynamic of the mountain and marine environment\
  \ made it feel unreal.The air is cold, strong harsh winds and the frozen sea. A\
  \ sense of disbelief will dawn on me as I would often ask myself if it was real?\
  \ Was I really here? This was the last thing I expected."
