Text: "The last thing I expected was to fall completely in love with Prague.\nFriends\
  \ had been telling me to go. They talked about the architecture, about the history,\
  \ and how affordable it really was. There was also the beer. They always mentioned\
  \ the beer.\nMorning broke with a dusting of snow. Prague is a beautiful place where\
  \ you feel as though you have stepped back in time. The snow turned it all into\
  \ something from an Eastern European fairy tale; at any moment you expected an ornate\
  \ carriage drawn by a team of elegant horses to emerge from a side street.\nBy afternoon,\
  \ the clouds had given way to brilliant sunshine and the place seemed to sparkle.\
  \ History is everywhere. People are also everywhere. It seems it doesn\u2019t matter\
  \ the time of year; there will always be crowds in Prague. \nIt was a perfect day\
  \ to just wander; through the Old Town, into churches or stores or coffee shops,\
  \ down side streets, wherever my interests took me. \nPrague is a storybook city,\
  \ with sherbet-colored buildings set next to architectural wedding cakes and medieval\
  \ spires; statues and pillars, towers and bridges, and of course a castle. Because\
  \ it can\u2019t be a storybook city without a castle.\nMy wanderings led me, finally,\
  \ across the famed Charles Bridge. It was a cold day to cross the river, the wind\
  \ that blew across was nicely frigid and yet I don't think any of us who were out\
  \ and about (which felt like ALL of us) cared. Prague was the belle of the ball\
  \ and we all wanted to be next to her.\nI ran into an elegant gentleman, someone\
  \ out of central casting for Eastern European Enigma - graying temples accenting\
  \ jet black hair, long black wool cape that swirled as he walked. He swept me a\
  \ bow as he passed. This would not happen anywhere else, but of course it would\
  \ in Prague. \nClimbing to the Castle, up steps that seemed to never end, I stopped\
  \ to catch my breath and take in the view. Looking out over the river, the Old Town,\
  \ and places beyond I realized that I was falling for Prague in ways I never expected.\
  \ \nBy the time I was done touring the Castle, I was cold and tired; yet I found\
  \ myself walking back to my hotel. It was unthinkable to miss this walk across the\
  \ city.\nIn the morning I was headed back home. I didn\u2019t want this visit to\
  \ end, staying awake until nearly dawn.\nAt the airport I found a quiet corner where\
  \ I waited for my flight to be called. To my surprise, I found that I was fighting\
  \ back tears.\nI lived in a fairy tale for a few days there - of course I never\
  \ wanted it to end."
