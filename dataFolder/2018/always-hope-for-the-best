Text: "A few weeks after I was refused entry at the border of the United States, I\
  \ am in Sudbury, Ontario. My dream was to see California. But I'm stuck here, in\
  \ this unattractive city traumatized by the mining industry. I get kicked out in\
  \ the early evening, because my host finally needed to leave for Toronto right away.\
  \ I have nowhere to go and a storm is coming. I decide to go on the road, and reach\
  \ Thunder Bay, 1000 km away. Obviously, it is a bad decision. It starts to rain,\
  \ and the night is approaching. I feel cold. I haven't packed anything warm. There\
  \ is a Tim Hortons close by. I could probably spend the night there, waiting for\
  \ the morning and better conditions to hitchhike. But I'm stubborn. I keep putting\
  \ out my thumb, smiling to the drivers passing by. However, despite the smile, I\
  \ feel hopeless.\n\nAfter almost an hour waiting, a car stops. A big black pick-up,\
  \ with orange lines on the hood. The driver is not going very far, but to a better\
  \ spot in his opinion. I get in, for a little bit of warm temperature and humanity.\
  \ My driver tells me that he needs to pass by his place first, to unload some stuff.\
  \ I offer to help. We arrive there. His small house is right next to one of the\
  \ biggest chimneys of the region. It's not in use anymore though. I help him, and\
  \ he invites me over for tea. My english is still quite basic, but we start to talk\
  \ a lot, and he is showing me pictures of his family, activities, passions. Tomas\
  \ is a tall guy of 60+ years old. He wears a cap, and has a clean white beard. He\
  \ is a pensioner and used to work for the mining industry here. He is calm and has\
  \ goodness that you can see in his eyes. It's getting late and dark. I ask him if\
  \ I can stay overnight and hitchhike the next morning. He accepts without any hesitation,\
  \ offers me food, makes me a bed, and wishes me a good night.\n\nI wake up at 8.:00\
  \ It is pouring rain outside. I prepare myself to leave. Tomas tells me to stop.\
  \ He doesn't want to see me leave under those conditions, and offers me to stay\
  \ overnight. I accept and I spend the day with him. He shows me around a little.\
  \ He offers me a lottery ticket and I win 20 dollars. I get to know Tomas a little\
  \ bit more. His generosity is beyond my imagination. He tells me how he arrived\
  \ late and dirty for a wedding since he stopped to help someone whose car broke\
  \ during his drive there. \n\nA few years later, I heard about his passing away.\
  \ He kept inviting me back to visit him, and I feel sad that I didn't. I will always\
  \ remember him."
