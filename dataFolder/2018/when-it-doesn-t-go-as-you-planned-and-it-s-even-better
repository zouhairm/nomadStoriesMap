Text: "At the end of my studies abroad in Spain, I decided to backpack around Europe\
  \ for a month during summer. After this, I was supposed to take a two week intensive\
  \ french course in Nice. I always dreamed about visiting this city and learning\
  \ a new language would be a plus.\nI visited 5 countries, met a lot of people and\
  \ took a bunch of buses, trains and planes, not paying enough attention to the deadline\
  \ to aply to the course. It was supposed to start on a monday, the day I would fly\
  \ from London to Nice, and I finaly applied the weekend before.\nAs soon as I got\
  \ there, I didn't get an answer back, so had to go to the city centre searching\
  \ for a free wi-fi and wait for it. Got there, found a fast-food restaurant and\
  \ tried to contact the people responsible for the course.\nTima was passing and\
  \ I was getting bored, so I had to have a second plan. Searched for a hostel near\
  \ the main street and decided to wait another hour, if I didn't get an answer I\
  \ would head to the hostel and check in.\nNever got my answer so I went straight\
  \ to the hostel and booked one night, sou i could have time to manage the situation\
  \ without worring about where to sleep. Since I was there, I could also start touristing.\
  \ Went to the beach, got a map and circled the places I wanted to visit and the\
  \ cities around it I could go. Got back to the hostel and figured out that they\
  \ liked to create a bond around the people and had the habit to throw meetings and\
  \ dinners, so everyone could get to know each other. I took a shower I went downstairs\
  \ as the party was starting. In a few minutes I had a lot of new friends from all\
  \ over the world! \nWe were having the best tine there, eating, drinking, talking\
  \ and laughing, but the party had to stop at 10 pm in order not to disturb the neighbours,\
  \ so we made a group and went discover the nightlife!\nWe had an amazing night and\
  \ at the day before I still didn't have an answer, so I got over of it and booked\
  \ the same two weeks I was supposed to spend in Nice in the first place. Now I could\
  \ visit all the places I had in my mind and do all the things that city could offer\
  \ me!\nOne week later I had met more people than I did the whole month backpacking!\
  \ I felt in Nice as I lived there my entire life! At the hostel I became friend\
  \ with the crew and started giving advices for the other guests about what to do\
  \ around there. That city was comfortable for me.\nAfter those two weeks I realized\
  \ that if I took that course I would never have such experiences. It ended up better\
  \ than planned."
