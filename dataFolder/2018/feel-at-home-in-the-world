Text: "I woke up with the melody of \"Take this waltz\" in my head. I remember when\
  \ I was little my father put me some Cohen albums that I didn\u2019t get to like\
  \ because I didn\u2019t understand them. Then, as the time went by, I think I can\
  \ say that I\u2019ve learned to appreciate Cohen and understand my father. Today\
  \ when I woke up I lifted the blind and a strangely radiant sun for a February 27\
  \ in Paris greeted me. For a few seconds I didn\u2019t know exactly if I was in\
  \ Barcelona or in Paris because here it rains much more than by the Mediterranean,\
  \ where I was born. I think Paris is trying to be nice to me even though I'm not\
  \ really clear yet why. I'm on vacation because I'm a Spanish teacher and now its\
  \ winter holidays. I have a kind of vital mismatch with space-time and sometimes\
  \ something similar to d\xE9j\xE0 vu happens to me, although I really don\u2019\
  t know what to call it. It is something that I haven\u2019t shared in depth with\
  \ anyone and I don\u2019t know if it happens only to me or is something normal among\
  \ people who live abroad. Today, for example, while going on the train, I suddenly\
  \ felt that this train of two floors that\u2019s so typical in Paris was all mine.\
  \ I mean, I felt that I have seen this train since my whole life, not just for six\
  \ monts. Suddenly while I was on the train I had the feeling that I had never taken\
  \ trains other than the RER E towards Haussman-Saint-Lazare, getting up at Rosa\
  \ Parks and getting off at Magenta, and yet I did take other trains. In fact, I\
  \ have taken many trains throughout my life. Today there was a woman at the Rosa\
  \ Parks station where I took the RER E that fascinated me. Although it was very\
  \ cold everyone had a happy face because it was sunny, but that woman, she seemed\
  \ to go further. She had short brown hair and was wearing it in a ponytail. I was\
  \ wearing three times more clothes than she did and was trembling, but she was only\
  \ dressed in a skirt and thin stockings. She wasn\u2019t even wearing a scarf. Her\
  \ eyes were closed and she was facing the sun trying to absorb as much light as\
  \ she could. She was smiling in a warm and calm way, and she was standing still\
  \ as if she was alone in the station because there was no one around her, it was\
  \ as if the others understood that we should not bother her at that moment. I watched\
  \ her delighted and with a smile until the RER E arrived and I jumped in. The woman\
  \ came up too but in another car, and I couldn\u2019t see her anymore but I felt\
  \ very calm. As Leonard Cohen said, we will have to take this waltz."
