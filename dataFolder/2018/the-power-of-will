Text: "The road to the starting point had been bumpy. It was short, but it seemed\
  \ very long. In the bus there were just a few of us, mainly locals and a few foreigners.\
  \ Arrived at destination there was no sign to where to go next. I looked around,\
  \ there was apparently just one way, and I followed. It was early morning but a\
  \ few trekkers were already coming back. They seemed at peace, there was not too\
  \ much fatigue on their faces. The first chunk of the road was dirty and dry. I\
  \ stopped at a restaurant and had fried rice. After that stop the road finally entered\
  \ the forest. It was all I was looking for, nature and silence. After the dusty\
  \ days spent in Kathmandu I couldn't wait to get out of the city. The weather was\
  \ great, sunny and clear blue sky. \nI started my trek full of energy and in a very\
  \ good mood but after a few hours of trekking through the woods I started to feel\
  \ tired. I couldn't see any hut around and I was worried that I would find myself\
  \ stuck in the middle of the woods at nightfall. I didn't meet any other trekker\
  \ along the way so I couldn't ask for directions. After 7 hours of non stop walking\
  \ I finally arrived at the first village. I asked at the first hut and they had\
  \ no free room, with the second I was luckier. I was exhausted and after dinner\
  \ and shower I fell asleep like a baby. \nDuring the following days as the altitude\
  \ got higher the air got thinner and I got more tired. My legs and back muscles\
  \ were soar and at some points my heart felt like it was about to explode. I met\
  \ a few trekkers along the way and made some road with them. I had to cross water\
  \ streams and thick areas of green but I felt good. I could only hear the river\
  \ flowing in the valley below and the birds chirping up in the trees. When I first\
  \ saw Annapurna mountain my heart leaped. I was exhausted and I felt I was not moving\
  \ fast enough but the view of \"Miss Annapurna\" made me understand why I was doing\
  \ that trek. \nWhen I arrived at basecamp it was 3.00pm on my third day. At 4000\
  \ m high the temperature dropped below zero and even in the hut it was freezing\
  \ cold. Here heating is not an option. The manager of the hut and the other people\
  \ working there where wearing a jacket all the time and so did we. \nI hadn't showered\
  \ in 4 days but all the effort was worth it. The fresh air and the white of the\
  \ snow on the mountain just a few meters away from me, were worth all the effort\
  \ and pain. Only then I realize that willpower can take you a long way. It's a lesson\
  \ I'll never forget."
