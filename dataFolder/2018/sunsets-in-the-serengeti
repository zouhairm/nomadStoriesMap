Text: "I had already been in Tanzania for three months studying Wildlife Management.\
  \ Yes, I learned a lot, and of course I made the closest of friends, but I yearned\
  \ to leave our small campus in the village of Rhotia. Finally, we were going on\
  \ expedition to camp in the Serengeti, no fence or electricity, just a tent with\
  \ a sleeping bad and a few close companions. We arrived after driving an entire\
  \ day, exhausted everyone immediately set up camp and went to bed. Tiredness was\
  \ not the only reason we all hid in out tents, the hyenas come out to laugh at night\
  \ and love our tasty shoes. The next morning I woke up unaware of my adventure.\
  \ The short rain season came early, so not hundreds, but thousands of wildebeest\
  \ surrounded our jeep and danced in the raindrops. Tarangire was a vast national\
  \ park, but the Serengeti, it was endless.\nThey don't call it the short rains for\
  \ nothing. They pass pretty quickly. After our lunch break I hopped back in my jeep\
  \ with my best friends and it began to downpour on us. A torrential downpour. Did\
  \ we close our roof to keep from getting wet? Of course not. We let the rainwater\
  \ replenish our dry skin and remove the dust from unwashed bodies. We felt clean\
  \ ultimately. \nBut, we had to race back to base camp, as night was falling fast.\
  \ I realized in this moment that the short rains aren't only there to help the Earth\
  \ grow, but also to create the most magical sunsets in the world. I asked myself,\
  \ how will it even be possible to describe this to those I love back home. Then\
  \ I thought, with words of course. \nThe cool wind raced past my cheeks whipping\
  \ my hair as Michael drove, hurried to get back to camp. We flew so fast it made\
  \ us feel like the sun could never catch us, but it did of course, drying our wet\
  \ soaked clothes. Dust blew from the tires of our jeep, creating a storm behind\
  \ us. The air was clean to breathe, almost like taking a sip of ice cold water.\
  \ My hands glazed across the sky. I heard nothing except my pounding heart and the\
  \ breeze. The sun began to sink in the sky, but it went slowly, leaving it's mark\
  \ on the world. The colors ranged sleep blue, light purple, deep red with a tinge\
  \ of orange, and a bright yellow. It sank over the mountains in the horizon, making\
  \ way for endless possibilities. There was one tree in the center of two mountain\
  \ slopes, silhouetted against the painted sky. \nI did not expect for it to be the\
  \ best moment of my life. It just happened. Spontaneity at it's finest. I suppose\
  \ all the best moments do. . ."
