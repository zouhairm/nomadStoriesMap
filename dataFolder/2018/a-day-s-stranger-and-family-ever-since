Text: "\"Pit Se\xF1or \" \"Pit Se\xF1or \", is how I would describe the start of my\
  \ day. The repeated chants by enthralled locals and tourists alike meant the city\
  \ is not what you had known it to be. Sinulog - the nine day celebration of the\
  \ southern city of Philippines, Cebu city, is held in the honor of \"Santo Ni\xF1\
  o\", a roman catholic title of Child Jesus. I first heard of Sinulog from a fellow\
  \ backpacker and I immediately knew where I would be in the third week of January.\n\
  \nWith eyes closed, and brain half lit, I lazily reached out to my specs. With a\
  \ confused gaze, I raised the curtains and flexed my muscles. The sound intensified\
  \ and the synchronous cheering of the crowd made me run in a jiffy. Excited I was\
  \ as I squeezed through the crowd of thousands and turned around to a sharp \"You\"\
  \ to find the amazing couple I met in a tuktuk last night on my way to hotel. Reyden\
  \ and Maria are a young filipino couple from a province close to Cebu city. Maria,\
  \ particularly is an outspoken , confident woman who has almost instantaneously\
  \ decided on my day's plan.\n\nAs we walked past the dozens of temporary food stalls\
  \ setup around the city, munching occasionally, we reached the center, Fuente Osme\xF1\
  a. I was in awe for the next few moments, unable to take my view off the amazing\
  \ Sinulog dance (back and forth movements) performed by multiple troops of dancers\
  \ dressed in traditional costumes. We joined the grand parade shouting at the top\
  \ of our voices \"Pit Se\xF1or\" for the next 2 hours till we took notice of the\
  \ exhaustion.\n\nBy the day's end, I knew the origin of Sinulog, the culture of\
  \ Cebu, the economy of Philippines, and its geopolitical conflicts as Maria would\
  \ know no full stops. Reyden would give an occasional characteristic grin which\
  \ probably meant \"Just listen\". I was glad to have accompanied by this couple\
  \ who invited me to their place for a lovely dinner and I realized they aren't just\
  \ a day's company. The next full week has been about whale shark diving in Oslob,\
  \ scuba diving in Mactan, snorkelling in Bantayan and lots of partying in Cebu.\
  \ I was honored by the invitation to her sister's wedding in Ormoc, an island close\
  \ to Cebu. I jumped in joy as it was one of the many firsts that I was experiencing\
  \ in the trip. I spent the whole night in a karoake bar with their cousins gulping\
  \ beers and trying hard to sing a filipino song. Though I wasn't a great singer,\
  \ I was glad that it made them happy.\n\nThe 2 week trip ended with some great memories,\
  \ but more importantly great friends."
