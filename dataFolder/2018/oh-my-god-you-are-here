Text: "Imagine being outside in the middle of nowhere in Africa at night, with a crashed\
  \ car, snakes and spiders around you, no light to see them or to see anything else\
  \ and beside you two clueless locals who are even more afraid than you are, a young\
  \ German girl on her first backpacking experience in South Africa. Sounds like the\
  \ perfect holiday? Actually it was. I admit, not this situation in particular. But\
  \ this night was the beginning of an amazing experience in South Africa.\nFirst\
  \ of all: we survived. Thanks to a functional mobile phone and a surf instructor\
  \ with a 4x4 car. As compensation to the night, our local friend KC wanted to show\
  \ us the place where he grew up, a township. It was like I had always imagined townships\
  \ would be. While we walked along the shanty houses made of metal, wood and other\
  \ material I realized the indescribable poverty and perceived the stench originating\
  \ from the dirty ground.  But instead of feeling depressed or sad I was quite impressed\
  \ by the creativity and the simplicity of living.\nWe crossed a playground where\
  \ the boys started fooling around as they saw us. After some calming words of KC\
  \ the initially shy girls came to touch us, our white skin and smooth hair. KC wanted\
  \ to introduce us to his friends, so we went on into a little tavern. We had a funny\
  \ evening talking, laughing, a cooking lesson and a delicious meal.\nLater that\
  \ evening more people came into the tavern. Astonished and curious they looked at\
  \ us, but just a few smiles later they dared to talk to the strange white girls.\
  \ Everybody was so grateful that we visited their tiny little township, one woman\
  \ took my hand and with tears in her eyes and a huge smile she said:\"Oh my god,\
  \ you are here!\"They hugged us, kissed us and I have never felt more welcome on\
  \ this planet. I would have given anything to express my overwhelming feelings,\
  \ my gratitude, my appreciation but I was unable to do anything. They turned on\
  \ the music so that we could dance together. They tried to teach us some words in\
  \ Khosa and we made them laugh due to our incompetence to pronounce the clicking\
  \ sounds.\nIt was the most amazing thing I have ever done. These people will forever\
  \ stay in my heart. They taught me that you don\xB4t need much to be happy and that\
  \ everyone is the creator of his own happiness. Finally the most amazing things\
  \ you experience during your travels are the humans you meet. And furthermore, even\
  \ an accident and a night with spiders, snakes and fear can turn into something\
  \ wonderful."
