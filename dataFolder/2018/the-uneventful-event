Text: "Whimsical traveler! That\u2019s what I am. I travel on a whim\nBut, Hornbill\
  \ festival; It was an event I wanted to attend without fail. \nSo, I booked my train\
  \ ticket a month in advance.It was a waitlist ticket so in case anyone cancels I\
  \ could get their seat.\nThe ticket never got confirmed.\nSo, I paid more for a\
  \ last minute confirmed ticket.\nAt 12 pm, I left for the railway station.I made\
  \ it by 6 PM. to read- 15910 Avadh Assam Exp, delayed by 4 hours.\n\n6-8 PM: I call\
  \ up my cousin to talk.Then I take out my Murakami, Kafka on the shore.But I don\u2019\
  t get to read much as a baby sitting next to me keeps snatching it.\nAt 8 PM a shopkeeper\
  \ asks me to go sit on platform 1.Why? Because I was a girl sitting alone.\n\n8-10\
  \ PM: I move, to right outside of what is called the \"upper class waiting area\"\
  .I am not allowed inside with my ticket.So I sit outside and count the number of\
  \ rafters on the ceiling.\n\nDear Passengers, train no. 15910 is delayed by 8 hours;\
  \ expected arrival,1.50AM.\n\n10-12 PM: I notice a beggar trying to get into a plastic\
  \ sheet.His bare feet are exposed.Another person is just sitting on the floor, shivering.I\
  \ take out my sketchbook and sketch this scene.To remember.\n\n12-1 AM: A friend\
  \ calls me and starts talking about marrying cows.When you are alone in the night\
  \ at a station it is surprising how talking about marrying cows seem very interesting.\n\
  \nDear Passengers, train no. 15910 is delayed by 11 hours; expected arrival,4.30\
  \ AM.\n\n1-2 AM: My friend calls and orders me to not get on the train if it comes\
  \ after 5 AM.Why?Because then when I reach Dimapur it would be 9 PM.My stay was\
  \ arranged for Kohima which was 3 hours away from Dimapur.\n\n2-4 AM: I move to\
  \ the lower class waiting area.It is stuffy and every chair is taken, almost every\
  \ part of the floor too.I head back to the platform.I fall asleep for a few minutes.\n\
  \n4-5 AM: I walk around the platform as it is too cold to just sit. My mom texts,\
  \ saying don't get on the train now.\n\n5-6 AM: The train makes its appearance at\
  \ 5.20 AM.I walk up to my coach.But my mother is texting - don't get in. \nDo I?\
  \ Or do I not? I never expected to be in this situation when I left the previous\
  \ morning!\nI call up my roommate.She says GO! I am almost in tears.The train leaves\
  \ as I am talking to her. It's 5.45AM.\n\n6-7 AM: I get out of the station, into\
  \ a taxi.At around 7 AM, dad calls.He tells me not to get on the train too.I finally\
  \ leave NJP after spending 13 hours there.\nHornbill was fun! Do visit. Just not\
  \ in Avadh Assam Exp."
