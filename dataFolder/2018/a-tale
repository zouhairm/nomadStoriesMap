Text: "\u201CI\u2019m going for walk\u2026ALONE!\u201D\nFor too long now I had inverted\
  \ David Hume\u2019s famous mantra and turned passion into the slave of reason, I\
  \ tought as I slowly turned my back on my fianc\xE9 leaving her babbling alone in\
  \ the Old Town\u2019s thick mist in the same indolent manner you leave your TV on\
  \ \u201Csnow\u201D and head straight to bed. \nMarta was every men\u2019s perfect\
  \ post break-up antidote, a female equivalent of a sports car. Fast, flashy, costly\
  \ and loud, very loud. We\u2019d been dating for 5 months and engagement was on\
  \ the horizon. But Hume\u2019s native Edinburgh revived my inquisitive nature as\
  \ much as it sharpened my wit, turning a 5 day romantic escapade to Highlands into\
  \ an all-time low bitter misanthropic comedy. \nStrolling past St.Giles\u2019s Cathedral\
  \ I had a flash of our visit there.\n \u201CI\u2019m having a \u2018medieval feeling\u2019\
  \u201D- she said while looking at the stained glass windows.\n \u201CI\u2019m having\
  \ more of an Illuminist idea\u201D- I thought to myself as I imagined the electric\
  \ sliding glass doors of the narthex converted into guillotine for chopping her\
  \ imbecile head.\nWalking up the Royal Mile, my eyeballs rolled back like in some\
  \ voodoo ceremony in same way as they did in the second day, when she insisted we\
  \ visited World of Ilusions. Swapping heads and paddling in a virtual fishtank made\
  \ up, according to her, for the perfect out-of-the-box dating experience. \nAs I\
  \ circumvented the massive fossilized nest that is the Castle, I saw in it the gigantic\
  \ pile of leaflets that she, like a bird, had gently gathered one by one and put\
  \ on top of my bed so I could make an informed choice between the Da Vinci Code,\
  \ the Harry Potter or the Underground Ghost tour.\nCrossing the platform over the\
  \ gardens that border the railway tracks, I passed by the National Scottish National\
  \ Gallery. When Marta and I visited it that morning, the speed of the train had\
  \ finally shocked with the slowness of art when she, after breaking the world record\
  \ for museum visiting, dragged me out. My last recall is that of Poussin\u2019s\
  \ \u201CMarriage\u201D merging with his \u201CExtreme Unction\u201D like strange\
  \ omen.\nStrolling through the linear streets of the New Town, the mist gave way\
  \ to a clinical white sky and my thoughts aligned themselves with the houses. Following\
  \ Hume\u2019s Walk I arrived at the top of Calton Hill. Edinburgh resembled a cooled\
  \ lava spill, with its now fiery orange sky. Marta came back to my mind and I tought\
  \ if only she could grasp that, like Hume said \u201Cbeauty, whether moral or natural,\
  \ is felt, more properly than perceived.\u201D"
