Text: "I consider myself somewhat of a conservative. I love how things have been done\
  \ and I take time to adjust to new realities. Yet with technology and internet one\
  \ has been forced to reform, including the need for innovation and creative evolution.\
  \ \n\nLiving in the urban city of Cape Town, going back home to the rural Eastern\
  \ Cape, South Africa. It often feels as if you\u2019re a tourist in your own home.\
  \ It\u2019s fascinating, exciting, and most interesting thing to watch, capture\
  \ and being part of it. The friendly warm smiles, the mountainous horizon scenery,\
  \ early morning animal sounds of birds, goats, sheep and cows. All form part of\
  \ this interwoven symbiosis of animals, people and nature.  \n\nDecember becomes\
  \ a hive of activity as all other tourist like residents return home, either for\
  \ holidays or for traditional ceremonies, at most times bringing urbanised friends\
  \ with. There are numerous festivities around this period but the most common is\
  \ the traditional \u201CBoys to Men initiation ritual\u201D. Unlike in the city\
  \ where each family sends their own son at most being two, here family of up to\
  \ 15 can club together to send their young boys to be initiated into manhood. It\
  \ becomes a village ceremonious event where traditional beer is brewed by women,\
  \ goats and sheep are slaughtered, boys chant songs renouncing their old ways in\
  \ the streets with torn clothes as a sign of beginning a new life. \n\nAnd after\
  \ 3 - 4 weeks away from people the young men return, splendid celebrations, and\
  \ people are in joyous giving mood. The returnee is showered with gifts from neighbors,\
  \ family members, and friends. Drinks like the home-brewed traditional Umqombothi\
  \ beer and all kinds flow, food, meat aplenty for everyone available. There are\
  \ no invitations needed to celebrate, you just rock up and you\u2019ll have plenty\
  \ to be merry. \n\nIt\u2019s a life of the rural traditional villages, year-in-year-out.\
  \ \n\nAs a photographer and lover of nature. Mountain hiking has become part of\
  \ my life; early morning rise to catch sunrises from the top of the hills has also\
  \ become customary in itself and sometimes the sunsets. \n\nUnlike in the urban\
  \ cities where there\u2019s bustling and hustling for the next step on the corporate\
  \ ladder, rural life has genuine personal connections.    \nI have never been outside\
  \ the country; I know rural, semi urban and urban life in Mzansi. I love capturing\
  \ it. \n\nLooking at life through eyes of the lenses.  In all instances I strive\
  \ to make connections with the locals I find myself in-between."
