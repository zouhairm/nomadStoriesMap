Text: "'Munich is a village' she had teased. 'If you think that's a big city, Berlin\
  \ is going to blow you away!'\nFrom the lengthy conversation I'd had with Jazmin,\
  \ that text was the one that stuck out to me the most. She sent it to get me excited\
  \ about arriving in her city, however what I was feeling was the exact opposite.\
  \ Suddenly less than ten minutes away from arriving at Berlin Central Bus Staition,\
  \ I was filled with an overwhelming sense of dread.\n\nIn that moment I realised\
  \ how many people there would be in this city, and that was the reason for my anxiety.\n\
  I was never a shy person, I've always been too comfortable in my skin to consider\
  \ myself one. That is until my skin itself became the prime source of my insecurity.\
  \ Coming to Germany from Zimbabwe, I expected to see a lot less black people than\
  \ I was used to. What I didn't expect, was that being black would make me such a\
  \ fascinating focal point for the average German's gaze!\n\nEverywhere I went I\
  \ constantly had eyes on me. The inquisitive stares of toddlers in my local Grocer.\
  \ The inconspicuous side eyeing from ladies crossing the street upon seeing me.\
  \ It was so intense that during my first few days in Munich, I would always stand\
  \ in the subway because looking up from my phone I was accosted by twenty indiscreet\
  \ glares, and assumed 'I must be in a Handicapped seat'. \nNow I would face the\
  \ same scrutiny, only on a much larger scale.\n\nStepping out the bus' narrow doorway\
  \ at an hour before midnight, I greeted Berlin with staunch pessimism, yet soon\
  \ that began to dissipate as the city dazzled me with with it's diverse nightscene.\n\
  Arriving so late on a Thursday evening, what I expected to be clear sidewalks lined\
  \ with closed storefronts, turned out to be streets churning with activity. The\
  \ lights were out in the skyscrapers towering above, however the lower level was\
  \ bright, bathed in a wash of light from the luminescent signs above '24hour' stores\
  \ and the adjacent street lamps.\nA group of Turkish girls laughed loudly across\
  \ the street, while two white men critiqued each others' dreadlocs outside a kebab\
  \ shop. I squeezed past an elderly black couple kissing by the subway entrance,\
  \ and had enough time to tip a beggar strumming a guitar for change before rushing\
  \ to my train. I was busy trying to find my Airbnb on my phone, but this time when\
  \ I looked up only one pair of eyes looked back at me.\nThe pretty Asian girl sitting\
  \ across from me flashed me a swift smile.\n\nI knew right then I'd enjoy my stay\
  \ in Berlin!"
