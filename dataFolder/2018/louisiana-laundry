Text: "The heat punches me hard in the face. A gust of ferocity, a blistering bluster.\
  \ BAM!  It\u2019s like opening an oven door in haste. Inside of a kitchen on fire.\n\
  \nI have to be more spirited, though, in New Orleans. A city that, however browbeaten\
  \ in its time, will always get back on its feet, if only to dance!  A resilience\
  \ forever heralded by triumphant trombones throughout the French Quarter.\n\nA streetcar\
  \ trundles by, past colourful beaded necklaces hanging from tree branches like voodoo\
  \ willows. The Big Easy.\n\nI\u2019m looking for the local launderette, but all\
  \ I find is a bar serving creole cuisine. I wander in, sodden as a gumbo shrimp.\n\
  \nA charmingly quirky place, the bartender\u2019s vibe falls somewhere between cool\
  \ and sketchy, illustrated best by the kind of gnarly neck and knuckle tattoos that\
  \ blur the lines between \u201CI got this in Austin from a hipster with a huge beard\u201D\
  \ and \u201CI got this in prison from a brute with a huge rap sheet\u201D. She offers\
  \ free rice and beans, alongside wonky pool tables and a seriously impressive jukebox.\n\
  \nAnd beyond them all, at the back of the room - a line of washing machines and\
  \ tumble driers. This city still holds many a surprise for practised wanderers,\
  \ and my starter for ten was surely a bar-launderette.\n\nTacked to the wall, a\
  \ ram-packed calendar of nightly events that I immediately resolve to attend; Pool\
  \ Tournament, Bingo, Open Mic... only to learn all were cancelled weeks ago due\
  \ to lack of interest!\n\nI do return \u2013 next laundry day. Sweat saturates my\
  \ back from the sky\u2019s furnace again. It\u2019s not just my clothes getting\
  \ a hot wash.\n\nIs this the same place, though?!  A myriad of multi-coloured sparkles\
  \ mask the furnishings, but sure enough I can see the white goods beyond the tinsel\
  \ and trees.  Wait, what else was on that redundant calendar?\n\n\u201CChristmas\
  \ In July!\u201D says a jubilant patron, between hearty mouthfuls of turkey and\
  \ trimmings from his polystyrene plate.\n\nAnd right on cue, in walks Santa Claus.\
  \ Or at least, Saint Nick as portrayed by the guy that serves delicious catfish\
  \ Po\u2019 Boy subs at a nearby deli; a large and charismatic man that both looks\
  \ and sounds like legendary local Louis Armstrong. He must be chief taster for the\
  \ eggnog too because he\u2019s as sauced as the Christmas puds!\n\nSozzled Santa\
  \ is the life and soul of what becomes a raucous party. Bringing Bourbon Street\
  \ and baubles, it\u2019s the perfect melding of the spirit of Christmas with the\
  \ spirit of New Orleans.\n\nThe machine beeps. I think I\u2019ll stay for another\
  \ spin\u2026"
