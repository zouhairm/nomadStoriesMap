Text: "There I was, sitting next to my friend, Ashkan, seat number 14 on a red bus.\
  \ This would be the first leg of our trip, a 17 hour ride to the city of Bazargan,\
  \ near the border of Turkey. We depart at 1:00 PM, sitting in the back compartment.\_\
  \ Today, I can recall the few passengers who were sitting close to us, as well as\
  \ the unexpected events that transpired upon our arrival at the Makou checkpoint,\
  \ 70 km away from the passport gates of Bazargan. This recollection is not quite\
  \ in the usual way, for what happened to us on that trip still grabs me in the throat\
  \ to this very day. Now, five years later, I\u2019ve finally found the opportunity\
  \ to speak up and let go. Everything seemed peaceful and just right until the moment\
  \ the Azari driver and the host called out \u201Cthe check point!\u201D. As police\
  \ forces, \u201Cthe Order Police\u201D, surrounded our bus. The women and girls\
  \ quickly pulled their headscarves forward to cover more of their hair. The men\
  \ woke up, buttoned their shirts and tidied their hair and faces. An officer, covered\
  \ in that dirty green-colored uniform, came up slowly with a suspecting look on\
  \ his face. He examined every corner of the car, every face and body part of the\
  \ passengers. A soldier and lieutenant double and triple checked following the captain.\
  \ Grabbing onto the seats one after another, the captain approached us at the end\
  \ of the aisle with the least bit of human emotion. By seeing a guy in the very\
  \ back, the captain moved quickly towards him. Pushing the man\u2019s wig off his\
  \ forehead, he remarked, \u201CAin\u2019t you so bald!\u201D - \u201CGo down!\u201D\
  \ \LTurning back, he approached us, \u201Cwhat are you?\u201D \L\u201CI am a student,\u201D\
  \ I responded. \LAshkan interrupted, \u201CWe are going to visit a friend of mine,\
  \ who is also a student at\u2026\u201D The captain cut him off, \u201CDown! Both\
  \ of you!\u201D then shouted toward his companions. \u201CStudent!\u201D\nExiting\
  \ the bus, a sergeant showed me the way to the other side of the road. A rusted\
  \ aluminum cabin stood out in its white-gray washed frame, shivering the cold of\
  \ nowhere. I entered the cabin and found a dark-skinned boney man adorned with a\
  \ pair of unbalanced spectacles. A cheap pen in his hand, he was writing down the\
  \ father\u2019s replies to his odd questions.\n\u201CThank you!\u201D he said.\n\
  \u201CAnytime!\u201D I replied, as I pushed the notebook back towards him.\n\u201C\
  You may go now!\u201D\n\u201CThank you!\u201D\nLooking out the window, I could not\
  \ shut my eyes even a minute until morning. We passed the border and changed for\
  \ a Turkish bus, as I was thinking, maybe it\u2019s better if I just move ahead\
  \ and never look back."
