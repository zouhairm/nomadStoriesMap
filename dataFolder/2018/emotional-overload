Text: "A day in 2016 in the North of Peru - definitively my most emotional and overwhelming\
  \ day of my life!!\nAfter five years of sponsorship with \u201EPlan International\u201C\
  \ and several letters with my goddaughter Rosa, I finally had the chance to visit\
  \ her and her family.\nAt 9am I was picked up in my hostel by a lady of the organization\
  \ \"Plan International\" and we drove to their office in Piura. After explaining\
  \ me everything about how they work, we drove to the village where the project was\
  \ working for 21 years and where Rosa is living and going to school. First we met\
  \ with the guys from the municipality in the town hall and I got a great insight\
  \ of where the donations are going in (health, water, education\u2026). I felt important\
  \ sitting with 8 Peruvian guys and the 2 coordination ladies from \"Plan\" at a\
  \ long meeting table and getting a lot of thanks, as well in form of a medal and\
  \ a straw hat. Afterwards we drove to the secondary school (Rosa is 13 years old\
  \ and visiting the 2\xB0 grade there). This moment was absolutely breathtaking and\
  \ overwhelming - I lost some tears! I met Rosa and the school prepared a ceremony\
  \ only for myself, with a warm welcome on the wall (\u201EBienvenida, Miss Wolf\u201C\
  ), music of brass instruments, a live singer, dancing, acceptance speeches of the\
  \ director, Rosa and other people (I could say some words, too) and again a present.\
  \ During most of my sponsorship Rosa visited the primary school, which we visited\
  \ as well to see where my money went to (colorful classrooms, teaching equipment\u2026\
  ) and I received again a lot of thankful words. Then it was time to visit the home\
  \ of Rosa and her family. Her mum passed away that year, so the family is still\
  \ very sad which I can absolutely understand. The entrance was decorated with German\
  \ flags and welcome posters - lovely!! They (dad and four kids) are living in a\
  \ small clay house with only two bedrooms (the two girls and the two boys share\
  \ one), a further bed is in the corridor. The family has support from their grandma\
  \ and aunt for cooking and household - the lunch was delicious (chicken, pasta with\
  \ tomato, banana, purple potato). Unfortunately I forgot the name of this dish,\
  \ but it is typical for events like Christmas, too. I could really feel the love\
  \ and thanks of these persons. Then it was already time to say goodbye and the most\
  \ emotional day of my life ended with a lot of heartwarming memories full of love\
  \ and happiness...\n\u201CAlways give without remembering and always receive without\
  \ forgetting.\u201D (Brian Tracy)"
