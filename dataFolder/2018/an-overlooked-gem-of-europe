Text: "I'd heard about the monuments in France, the cities in Italy, the canyons in\
  \ Spain. So, as we were road tripping through Europe with a couple of ratty backpacks,\
  \ a too-small tent, and a Volkswagen Polo old enough not to have the registration\
  \ date on the plates, what I didn't expect was Slovenia. We had only scheduled a\
  \ cursory visit to this little country while we headed into Trieste, Italy, where\
  \ we would stay at a friend's house. Slovenia, though, had other plans for us. \n\
  \nLake Bled was something out of the fantasy stories I enjoyed so much as a child.\
  \ Its still water made the perfect mirror for the castle rising on the rocks, for\
  \ the autumn-colored forest, and the cloudless sky stretching towards us in a canvas\
  \ of blue. In the middle of the lake was an island, small yet endlessly extraordinary,\
  \ with its little houses and church standing bright under the cold October sun.\
  \ It was nothing compared to where we found ourselves next: I can, without doubt,\
  \ say Vintgar Gorge was one of the most magical landscapes I've ever seen. You could\
  \ see the testament of nature's claim written on its stone, spelling the ruthlessness\
  \ of time and the certainty that life always finds a way. A mist permeated the air\
  \ and solid rock surrounded us, huge walls full of life, dull grey exploding into\
  \ splatters of greens and yellows, trees perched above us at odd angles, reaching\
  \ out with their crooked fingers, as if to protect this sacred place we had dared\
  \ enter. All of this carved by the gentle, steady stream bellow us, so seemingly\
  \ harmless despite the proof of its power being all around us. The water had a special\
  \ glow, a nearly impossible blue-green that was somehow perfectly transparent; the\
  \ kind of color you expect to find in Photoshopped photos and pretty Instagram filters,\
  \ but not in real life. \u201CAh,\u201D I thought, \u201Cthis is it.\u201D There\
  \ comes a point in every good journey when you're met with something you never expected.\
  \ Perhaps it's the feeling of being at home in a country that is not your own, or\
  \ being embraced by a strange foreign custom. Perhaps it's a corner shop tucked\
  \ in an hidden street, or an old lady who tells you about the history of a place.\
  \ Perhaps it's meeting someone who changes your views, or making a friend you might\
  \ never see again. Perhaps it's just the raw will and beauty of nature. For me,\
  \ it was a country. Slovenia proved that our favorite things can often come in packages\
  \ we don't expect. Hopefully, we'll still be wise enough to open them."
