Text: "(Character)\n\nWhere people are getting killed\nand neighborhoods are trembling\
  \ from the humming fire \nI see the bird unable to move the body\nchoosing life\
  \ as a statue with no bird inside\nI choose a corner overlooking the weapon of death\n\
  I hide my eyes\nso I don\u2019t see snipers shooting into them\nThen, the bird starts\
  \ playing his tune\nchoosing the sound of the bird inside.\n\n(Mistake)\n\nThe one\
  \ who was calling out for his sister\nor his brother \nhe whose voice was cut\n\
  perhaps no other voice has answered him\nOr was it just my unsteady sense of hearing\n\
  that took me away from his harsh words?\nOr was it him who held back upon seeing\
  \ his killers\nin the bodies of his family?\nMaybe I still don\u2019t know what\
  \ I know\nor what I will know\nMaybe everyone has been killed\nand my killer, still\
  \ mistaking my body\nstill doesn't know\nI\u2019m still inside.\n\n(Hit)\n\nLeave\
  \ your arm and get down \nTry -a bit- to come to me crawling \nKeep your head down\
  \ and look at me \nI\u2019m your love my friend \nDon\u2019t throw yourself into\
  \ the arms of your death\nwhile I am here \nI am your bread in your life\nand your\
  \ weapon in your wars\nso get down \nLeave your arm and wait for me \nI AM YOUR\
  \ ARM right here\nmy friend, you\u2019re still alive.\n\n(Inspiration)\n\nGod tells\
  \ me,\nThat the victim\nDoes not believe his killers,\nAnd everything after his\
  \ death\nDoes not increase his absence.\nGod says,\nThat I lied; I didn\u2019t tell\
  \ the truth,\nEven though I meant it.\nAnd he tells me:\nWhom you didn\u2019t believe\
  \ his death,\nEmbarrassed you with his life\u2019s honesty.\n \n(News)\n\nI might\
  \ die today\nEven if my life did not finish\nI might see, what I\u2019ve never visited\
  \ with my vision\nI might not repeat the eye-scene (again) in my imagination\nI\
  \ might not be in the number\nOf whom dying on the screens\nBut, I might live\n\
  And the other/stranger dies\nI might not believe his death.\n\n(Coexistence)\n\n\
  War kills us all\nNot our bodies, that die\nBut everything we didn\u2019t say\n\
  And lived in us silently\nWar kills with silence.\n\n(Inability/Hope)\n\nWhat\u2019\
  s not my body -now- is hurting me\nThis is the great fear\nOf what\u2019s coming\n\
  What I don\u2019t feel is overwhelming\nPushing me to tell my mum\nTo stay on the\
  \ ground\nSo I might see her -after this day- with her full parts\nThis morning\n\
  The eloquent war -out of me- speaks fluently\nThat my understanding loses its eloquence."
