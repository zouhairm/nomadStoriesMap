Text: "While I was exploring the world\u2019s oldest and inhabited city of Syria -\
  \ Damascus, a hatchet-faced young boy, in his late teens, with untidy, torn clothes,\
  \ greeting me with his wide yet rusty smile, asked for some food. Since I too hadn\u2019\
  t eaten anything for last 2 hours, I too joined his mission to find some food. With\
  \ curiosity surging my minds, I asked him about his breakfast. He remained silent\
  \ but then replied that he hadn\u2019t eaten anything for last 2 weeks. This reply\
  \ of him shook me with shrills. Goosebumps surged through my body, felt a little\
  \ earthquake inside of me. Didn\u2019t know what to ask more. I quickly rushed to\
  \ the nearest food store, ordering some food for him. His small brown eyes lit up\
  \ on seeing food and started eating like he hadn\u2019t eaten for many years. I\
  \ kept on staring his innocent face with content. Quietly. I didn\u2019t eat anything.\
  \ My stomach was getting filled with each bite the boy was taking. \n\nI enquired\
  \ his name, his home and whatnot like I was interviewing him for some verification\
  \ process. With little confidence in his hefty voice, he said Abraham. But on asking\
  \ about his home, his shining eyes subtly became teary. He couldn\u2019t utter a\
  \ single word anymore. I stopped asking more, couldn\u2019t ask him anything again.\
  \ How could I? I felt guilty. My usual yet unwise question offended the brown-eyed\
  \ boy. However, he gathered some courage and replied that he lived in underground\
  \ shelters, in order to hide from the airstrikes.\n\nWhat type of life is this,\
  \ I intrigued. I was stunned to hear but wanted to know more. He continued with\
  \ tears in his eyes, trying to explain me as much as he could, about the tragic\
  \ life of Syrian people in the beautiful city of Damascus. People are hiding in\
  \ basements, hungry for weeks, children are brutally killed, ambulances are targeted,\
  \ doctors are forced to use expired drugs, and begging to save them from this catastrophic\
  \ disaster. \n\nI tried to comfort him, but I couldn\u2019t. He told that his younger\
  \ sister wanted to die since she believed to get food in heaven. The ground started\
  \ crumbling underneath my feet. I was unable to experience their pain. As long as\
  \ he keeps on continuing, I kept on falling in the well of grief. Suddenly, he stood\
  \ up, thanked me and assured me to be my travel guide for the next time, when peace\
  \ would be established on his land. With such deep hope in his heart, he bid farewell\
  \ and speedily rushed towards his underground home, making me realize how blessed\
  \ I have been living so far."
