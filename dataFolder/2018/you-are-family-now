Text: "I fell in love with the city of Hai Phong the way I fall in love with everything\
  \ else. A little bit at a time and then suddenly, all at once. I loved the way the\
  \ air down Nguyen Binh Street smelled of deep fried spring rolls, grilled meat and\
  \ fish sauce. I loved how absolutely ridiculous the traffic down Lach Tray Street\
  \ was, with the grandmas on bicycles running red lights and everyone else squeezing\
  \ their motorcycles and scooters past each other with no care in the world because\
  \ they're all trying to get somewhere fast.\nToday, I am one of them. I honk my\
  \ horn over a dozen times and yell \"Xin Loi\" as I maneuvre my motorbike in between\
  \ a group of high schoolers on scooters and a family of four on a motorcycle. This\
  \ is completely normal for a Saturday afternoon and my \"road ettiquette\" is totally\
  \ acceptable.\nI'm on my way to have lunch with my friend Hannah, who is my Vietnamese\
  \ teaching assistant as well, and her family. I have been to Hannah's home twice\
  \ before but this time it is a special lunch that her mother insisted on having\
  \ because I am about to return to Fiji.\nI make my way down the narrow alley and\
  \ park my bike outside the home where Hannah is all dressed up and waiting for me\
  \ outside. \"My mother made your favourite! We're having Bun Cha!\" she says, and\
  \ almost immediately, my mouth starts to water.  I take off my shoes outside the\
  \ door and step into the house where the smell of food hits me like the bus that\
  \ hit Regina George in the movie \"Mean Girls\". I am starving.\nHannah's mother\
  \ comes out of the kitchen and with a big smile, she comes over to hug me and says\
  \ \"we eat now\" then grabs me by the arm and rushes me into the dining area where\
  \ Hannah's father and her two cousins are already seated on the floor. They do not\
  \ understand English but I know that they've been asking Hannah to teach them simple\
  \ phrases in order to communicate with me. There is an enormous feast spread out\
  \ across the mat on the floor and my favourite Vietnamese dish, Bun Cha, is set\
  \ right in front of where I'm supposed to sit, which is right in between Hannah\
  \ and her mother and across from her father.\nAs we began to eat, Hannah's father\
  \ stands and brings back a bottle of Rice Wine and the special glasses that, Hannah\
  \ had explained once before, were only used for family. He poured a glass and thrusted\
  \ it into my hands before raising his own glass with an enormous smile and said\
  \ \"B\u1EA1n l\xE0 ng\u01B0\u1EDDi nh\xE0 r\u1ED3i\". Hannah saw the look of confusion\
  \ on my face and decided to translate for me. \"He says that you are family now\"\
  ."
