Text: "Can you aspire to be homeless?  According to Cambridge Dictionary Vagabond\
  \ means without home. Wanderer. Traveler. No Mad. These are few fancy terms for\
  \ travelers with cool meaning but hidden reality. The term \"Vagabond\" also collectively\
  \ describes people who keep traveling from one place to another. WOW!\nNow you want\
  \ to be one!\n31st Dec 2016, new years eve when its 7\u2103 in Delhi, India and\
  \ I am having my \"Chai+Sutta\"  (Tea and Smoke) with my childhood friends, luckily\
  \ we still meet everyday. I received a call from a new friend I had recently met\
  \ at my new work place. by the way I am jobless now changed 2 jobs, got fired from\
  \ one. life is tough. so I got a call from friend asking me if I would like to join\
  \ his trip which he was planning solo.\nNever been out. I was excited to hear his\
  \ plan but I was not able to decide because of money, family and every other not\
  \ so important things that I gave importance back then. I decided to go with him.\
  \ *Place is Malana, HP, India. I booked Redbus that evening from Delhi to Bhunter,\
  \ from Bhunter you can take Himachal Roadways bus or Cab to Kasol. it's dependent\
  \ on your pocket as Bus is cheaper option. now Kasol is a small village in HP where\
  \ you'll find different type of cuisines and some cool riverside cafe's and hotel\
  \ to stay, one of the best place to find comfort in Himachal. \nWe filled our stomach\
  \ with Israeli food and left toward our Destination Malana arround 4:00 PM 1 Jan\
  \ 2017. it's New Year.\nFrom Kasol to a point where you start trekking towards Malana\
  \ Village called \"Niraang\" we took cab it takes another 1.5 hour.\nIt was already\
  \ drizzling as soon as we reached, I witnessed how the tip of the all the gigantic\
  \ mountains gets covered with snow. \nWe are here looking at a small village very\
  \ far on different mountain it looked scary that evening we started trekking at\
  \ 6:00 PM and reached there by 7:30 this includes breaks we continued walking/trekking\
  \ inside village to reach on top and stayed in a cafe there. I tried Malana Cream\
  \ first time that day gazed at starts for so long, I don't  know why I was not tired\
  \ at all now finally arround 2:30-3:00 AM I slept so that I can start my day early\
  \ next morning. Good Morning! It's 10:00 AM 2nd Day Jan 2017, Malana Village, Himachal\
  \ Pradesh. Pogo woke me up, cafe owners pet or child I must say.\nWeather is sunny,\
  \ windy and the snow that covered tip of mountain last evening it's still there.\
  \ Hadn't I pushed myself for this first trip I wouldn't have made next three trips\
  \ in 2017."
