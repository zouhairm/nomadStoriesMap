Text: "Being a budding nineteen-year-old, having started my University degree, I saw\
  \ an advertisement shouting, \u201CONLY TWELVE SPOTS LEFT, APPLY NOW\u201D, and\
  \ made an impulsive decision to fly to Papua New Guinea. All was going well until\
  \ the fifth day, where we were greeted with an unusual wake up call. Just as the\
  \ sunrise hit the top of our tents we awoke from a woman loudly shouting gibberish.\
  \ This was due to her being off her face on Betel Nut, while waving around a large\
  \ machete. This would have been an amusing sight, had I not needed to use the bathroom.\
  \ Making a detour with a fellow group wanting that sweet release of built-up fluids,\
  \ we made it while avoiding machete dancing, drug induced lady. My stream was solid\
  \ (thanks for asking), but mid pee I hear the singing getting louder. At this point\
  \ my companions have walked back, leaving me, with this woman edging closer. She\
  \ was right outside the wooden structure of the lavatory, when through a gap I could\
  \ see shadows of her machete waving through, like a shadow puppet show gone horribly\
  \ wrong. Just as I thought she would catch me with my pants down, a village local\
  \ came and ushered her away, leaving me able to finish my ablutions. But, the last\
  \ thing I expected on the trip came while respectfully idling through the Port Moresby\
  \ Cemetery. The place was large, almost the size of a football field, with a gazebo\
  \ and prayer room. The grass was lush and freshly cut. It was quiet, the kind that\
  \ comes from respecting the fallen. There was shade provided from the outlining\
  \ trees which circulated the perimeter. The majority of the cemetery was filled\
  \ with creamy, off-white headstones. Most had names, ages and a little quote. I\
  \ was overwhelmed with the amount which stated, \u2018An Australian soldier of the\
  \ 1939-1945 War,\u2019 with an inscription at the bottom, \u2018Known unto God.\u2019\
  \ Less a grave and more a commemoration for the fallen which were never discovered,\
  \ bodies buried in Papua New Guinea. It was in this moment I understood the sacrifice\
  \ our soldiers made. I was impacted further on seeing the majority of ages under\
  \ twenty-five. I was nineteen, and to think I would have to pack my bags and go\
  \ fight a war, potentially never to return, never to experience the beauty time\
  \ brings with loved ones, to have lived the final months in fear. I was overcome\
  \ with emotion and buried in gratitude, the further I walked the more the tears\
  \ plummeted. I had come to acknowledge the ANZACS, but I had never expected to be\
  \ so taken by their sacrifice."
