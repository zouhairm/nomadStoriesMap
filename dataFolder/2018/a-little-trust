Text: "I buckled my helmet and traced the thin outline on my leggings where I had\
  \ stashed several hundred rupiah. We had agreed to navigate this new culture as\
  \ authentically as possible, and a moped seemed the most practical way of doing\
  \ so.\n\nWith a rumble, the ignition started. I grasped tightly to the seat, placing\
  \ one foot on the footrest while balancing precariously on the other.\n\n\u201C\
  Are you ready?\u201D my friend asked. \u201CWe\u2019ll start on the little back\
  \ roads. Remember, when people put their trust in me, it does wonders!\u201D\n\n\
  \u201CI\u2019m as ready as I\u2019m going to be,\u201D I replied with a mixture\
  \ of excitement and trepidation.\n\nWe rolled slowly onto the dusty roads behind\
  \ our homestay, her confidence growing as the locals looked on. She is half Filipina,\
  \ easily mistaken for being Indonesian. I am fair-skinned, and I compensate for\
  \ sunshine by wearing more sun-protective clothing than most people will own in\
  \ a lifetime. What a spectacle we must have been.\n\nAt last we were on the main\
  \ stretch. A welcome breeze rushed past as I took it all in.  The narrow streets\
  \ were lined by small markets and warungs, each one adding color and depth to the\
  \ cultural richness of the landscape. Mopeds, some carrying entire families, threaded\
  \ through the streets, appearing and disappearing by way of smaller roads invisible\
  \ to the inattentive eye.\n\nThere were no stoplights here, only unspoken rules\
  \ governing the chaotic parade of vehicles. Though we were learning quickly, weaving\
  \ into the Balinese traffic had not been seamless. While I was growing anxious,\
  \ my friend was becoming increasingly fueled by adrenaline.\n\n\u201CWhich way?\u201D\
  \ she asked at the next turn in the road.\n\n\u201CLet\u2019s go right,\u201D I\
  \ answered, feigning bravery. We did not know where it would lead, but that was\
  \ all part of the adventure. \n\nWe took a fear-inducing tight right turn, and gradually,\
  \ unexpectedly, the scene began to change until our moped was the only thing winding\
  \ along the narrow road. Rice patties replaced buildings, stretching out in endless\
  \ lines of deep green. Balinese men with sun-weathered skin worked under their round\
  \ woven hats. Wild dogs played and roamed aimlessly along the horizon.\n\nI took\
  \ a deep breath as we made our way through the foreign terrain, creating a single\
  \ trail of motion in an otherwise still world. The air whipped through my clothes,\
  \ and the scene played before me like a silent movie reel while my fear finally\
  \ gave way to relief. Joy, even. \n\nPerhaps a little trust does do wonders."
