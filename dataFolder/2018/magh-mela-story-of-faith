Text: "From a distance it seemed like spots of dew and mist endowed with faded light\
  \ specks. An array of tent huts were built one after the other, thousands of them,\
  \ in the same way we used to draw closeness in our school days sketches. A meandering\
  \ travel journey brought me to the awed presence of Allahabad\u2019s Magh Mela,\
  \ a destination of faith in the northern part of India, on a cold January night\
  \ at 1 am. Starting in January, it is considered as the time of connectedness of\
  \ life and space as millions of people come together for a month stating their own\
  \ reasons of realities. Being a modernist in approach with perspectives based on\
  \ logic and reason, this place seemed unreal to me in the first glance.\nPeople,\
  \ lots of them in these tents, were lost in deep slumber open to vitalities of the\
  \ universe. The \u2018starry night\u2019 as Vincent van Gogh expressed in his creation,\
  \ seemed like a close acquaintance that moment. \u2018Sangam\" looked endearing\
  \ from a faraway sight. \n\u201CYou cannot take your car ahead\u201D, the policeman\
  \ cautioned me.  I walked down, pushing the shiver of sand and stilling freeze in\
  \ my palms as my eyes filtered incisive advertisements on poles. Not even a speck\
  \ of dust and fumblessness of space; the entire stretch was spotless clean. The\
  \ no man\u2019s land was embellished to a temporary township for a month. Beautiful\
  \ Hindi typography in black twinkled on exteriors of changing rooms, water kiosks\
  \ and sanitation arrangements. I touched the black hue to see if the paint was fresh\
  \ and wet, like a juvenile. \nI could hear a few faint voices, fidgeting with my\
  \ attention. A group of uncanny \u2018sadhus\u2019 or monks exuded a friendly smile\
  \ as I passed by. Their fierce eyes, unkempt thickness of locks, multiple beaded\
  \ rudraksh adorning their necks, made them all have a similar appearance. \nMy heart\
  \ felt a hurried excitement as I continued walking towards \u2018Sangam\u2019. Sangam\
  \ or Confluence is the part where- rivers Ganga, Yamuna and disappeared Saraswati\
  \ are said to converge. It is considered to be significantly holy to bathe in Sangam\
  \ while prostrating towards the energy of Sun. A definite curve of bright yellow\
  \ lights adorned its contours. A few boats tethered along the shore stood together\
  \ in anticipation of next morning. \nExperience of lifelessness or vitality, escapism\
  \ or introspection, minimalism or materialism; \u2018Sangam\u2019 was a witness\
  \ of many hopes and reasons taking holy baths every year. \nI stood there still\
  \ with my eyes closed, in an attempt to befriend the water and make a wish."
