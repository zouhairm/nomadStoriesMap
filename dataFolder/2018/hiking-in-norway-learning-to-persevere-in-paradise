Text: "It\u2019s spring in Bergen, a small Norwegian town settled along the water,\
  \ surrounded by mountains. Today\u2019s hike from Mt. Ulriken to Mt. Floyen is the\
  \ most anticipated adventure of our 10-day trip. We arm ourselves with determination\
  \ to keep the jet lag and sleep deprivation from dampening our spirits. \n\nWe shuffle\
  \ with the crowd into a tiny red tram packing ourselves in like sardines and begin\
  \ our slow ascent up the mountain. From the top, we see ant-sized ships and ferries\
  \ tow cargo and tourists into the surrounding fjords. Behind us, the mountain fog\
  \ swirls and shifts delicately, obscuring and revealing our fate.\n \nThere is no\
  \ path, only stone cairns placed a quarter mile apart to mark the way. We set off,\
  \  stomping and squishing through mud, over boulders and streams, up and down steep\
  \ mountainsides. Each cairn becomes another personal achievement. The further we\
  \ explore, the more my feet and knees protest. A thought pushes its way from the\
  \ back of my mind: You are not prepared for what is to come.\n\nUp and down and\
  \ up again; The hike is endless. As more people pass me, I feel their silent judgment.\
  \ Runners, the elderly, and small children bound down steep mountainsides, skipping\
  \ on boulders like goats.\n\nThough this hike demands endurance, it gives back in\
  \ wild, untamed beauty. Nowhere else have I seen such perfectly reflecting silver\
  \ lakes, or wandered so high nearly touching the clouds. I strengthen my resolve,\
  \ leaning into the pain, and focusing on veins of white quartz in every boulder\
  \ and the countless hues of green in every patch of grass. I take many breaks, but\
  \ the throbbing is relentless. There is no calling a car to come get me and there\
  \ is no going back. It\u2019s just me, my pain, and the wilderness. I\u2019m a jumble\
  \ of raw emotions and tears visibly streaming down my face. \n\nAt the end of our\
  \ 13-kilometer ordeal crowds of people sit eating late lunches, smiling. No one\
  \ knows what I\u2019ve just endured. I crumple to the ground, unable to take in\
  \ the sun sinking over the fjords, a view I worked so hard for. All I feel is disappointment.\
  \ \n \nWe limp back, dirty and smelly and stagger into the nicest restaurant we\
  \ can find. I kick off my mud-encrusted boots under the table, hoping no one notices.\
  \ That night we reward ourselves with thick steak, scallops, and champagne. Now\
  \ that the pain has faded, I\u2019m left with a sense of pride for what we did.\
  \ I now know I can test my limits farther and come out the other side stronger."
