Text: "When we reached Rangat, the jetty was deserted. But Titus soon arrived, apologizing\
  \ profusely, and began the long drive up to Mayabunder, while making stilted small\
  \ talk and asking a few polite questions about Mumbai and about what running a corporate\
  \ law firm is like. He was shy, and besides, as mainlanders, we were not entirely\
  \ welcome, although we would be a handy source of extra income for the next few\
  \ days, as we were paying for our room and board, and for the driving.\nThere were\
  \ many drives, and many conversations, and, in time, as often happens, they became\
  \ real conversations. But, throughout our stay, the transactional element persisted,\
  \ and we settled our bills at the end of each day. Titus was quite firm about this,\
  \ although he also seemed embarrassed by it. He had plans for the extra money.\n\
  Titus was a Karen. The British had brought a few of them to Mayabunder from Burma,\
  \ as mahouts, to train and ride the elephants used for logging in the Andamans\u2019\
  \ teak forests. He\u2019d grown up in Webi, the oldest of the eight Karen villages,\
  \ and spoke slowly about his childhood, choosing his words carefully, to try and\
  \ explain how all the kids worked hard outdoors, foraging for fruit and herbs in\
  \ the jungle, digging up crabs, fishing and diving without anything much by way\
  \ of equipment. The old communal subsistence lifestyle that he remembered so fondly\
  \ had now all but vanished, as the Karens had moved into office jobs on the mainland\
  \ or started tourist focused businesses in Port Blair or on Havelock. It hurt him\
  \ to talk about it. But then he shrugged, and told us how he\u2019d studied hotel\
  \ management in Chennai, worked for India\u2019s Taj Group and then returned home\
  \ to set up Mayabunder\u2019s only lodge. Most of his income came from local patrons\
  \ of the lodge bar and from government functionaries who would stay at the lodge\
  \ for a single night while on official business. \nWhen we wanted to go night fishing,\
  \ Titus hemmed and hawed for a while, then told us quietly that it was quite difficult\
  \ to get a decent catch nowadays. But eventually he arranged a tiny country boat\
  \ with a couple of nylon lines, two small hooks, a flashlight, and a handful of\
  \ fresh shrimp as bait. We returned with six red snappers, and gave four of them\
  \ to Titus as a gift. He took them quietly, mumbled sheepishly at us, and walked\
  \ away. \nWhen we left a few days later, Titus offered to drive us all the way to\
  \ Port Blair himself, and he did. And this time, he flatly refused to take any money."
