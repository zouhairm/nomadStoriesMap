Text: "Nestled in the Caribbean Sea, about 100 miles from Florida, is the beautiful\
  \ island of Cuba. Left largely unexplored by Americans over the past 60 years, this\
  \ ex-Communist nation has an explosive history that includes music, art, dance,\
  \ alcohol and most notably cigars. A couple of my friends from England and Trinidad\
  \ and Tobago have visited, so when former U.S. President Barack Obama opened the\
  \ doors for Americans to travel to the country, I decided to take the opportunity\
  \ to do so.  So, with five days to spare, but a whole lot of sites to see, my three\
  \ travel mates and I made our way to Cuba: first stop, La Habana.\n\nAs portrayed\
  \ in the media, the streets are filled with American vehicles from the 1950s; when\
  \ the country enjoyed support from the U.S. during the rule of Fulgencio Batista.\
  \ From what we saw over the few days, poverty is not as visible as in the Rio favelas\
  \ or the shantytowns in Nairobi. Everyone seems to take care of each other; a strong\
  \ sense of community as opposed to individualism. But, the best part was when night\
  \ fell, everyone in the neighborhood came out to sit on the streets to use the free\
  \ Wi-Fi from the large hotels.  \n\nOur next stop was Trinidad.  A UNESCO World\
  \ Heritage site, about six hours by car from Havana, the city is infamously for\
  \ its alcoholic beverage: canchancara. Many of its citizens use donkeys and bicycles\
  \ as their main mode of transportation. Each day, we would walk from our hostel\
  \ to the main street and run into stray dogs that would actually be our tour guides.\
  \ It seems as though they knew where we wanted to go -- or they knew that this was\
  \ the main place to visit if they had a chance of getting food! My friend, who is\
  \ an animal lover, would speak to them in Spanish and pet them, which increased\
  \ our connection to them. They would wait outside the restaurant until we finished\
  \ eat and we continued to follow them to another location! Even when we went to\
  \ a nightclub, the dogs led the way and waited outside until we were ready to go\
  \ back to the hostel.\n\nIt was quite sad when we left Trinidad. Maybe we really\
  \ did create a bond or maybe it is because we were the only ones to pay them attention\
  \ and feed them.  Either way, it made our trip extremely memorable and continued\
  \ to coincide with the generosity of Cuba on the whole: from the people to the animals.\
  \  For those who are yet to visit this culturally-rich, prideful and energetic island,\
  \ I would highly recommend it. Who knows - you may make a local connection like\
  \ us!"
