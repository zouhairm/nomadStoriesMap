Text: "Once upon a time there was a girl who was living a good life, had friends,\
  \ a boyfriend, an amazing mum and a gorgeous dog, but have you ever felt like having\
  \ everything, but missing a giant part of the heart? Like missing your inner self?\
  \ \nThat was me!\nSo once, like destinity was waiting for me, I jumped into the\
  \ opportunity to travel and to write of what my eyes and my heart were seeing.\n\
  I think that when wiriting joins travelling, that's the therapy goal for the peace\
  \ of the soul, they are both therapies where you can be yourself, just you, your\
  \ thoughts and the environment around, in that mood you can find what you had lost\
  \ and discover what you had never known.\nI packed my stuff and departed for my\
  \ spirit journey! Happy and afraid at the same time.\nThe first person that I met\
  \ was my writing mentor, who helped me in canalising my feelings into the tip of\
  \ the pen, then I met Susan, my crazy travel mate, who became my best friend and\
  \ yerba mate all day long ;)\nAfter a long trip we arrived in Buenos Aires and started\
  \ to learn more of the Argentina culture, I have also managed to meet one of my\
  \ relatives who went to Buenos Aires years ago and that was so emotional, I have\
  \ heard his story and wrote about it.\nWe then travelled all around the country,\
  \ perceiving every smell, every sound, in particular the sound of the ice cracking\
  \ into the glaciers of Patagonia, oh that sound... it will be always inside my head!\n\
  I have met amazing people, I have known a culture that enriched my souls and my\
  \ life through their stories, I have eaten food that I have never know I could eat\
  \ in my life, and when it all ended, my mission was completed, I looked into the\
  \ mirror and finally met...me! I finally knew who I was, a simple girls, with a\
  \ big energy and passion for travelling and willing to share all my experiences\
  \ with those interested!\nMy final advise is: travel, if you don't know the world,\
  \ you can't know yourself!\nSee you on the next adventure,\nXx\nYlenia"
