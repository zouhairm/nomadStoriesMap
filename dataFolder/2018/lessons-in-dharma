Text: "I let my fingertips linger on the faded prayer flag above my head.\nI had come\
  \ across a woman by the golden stupa. She offered to tell me about the Buddhist\
  \ Temple\u2019s practices. The stupa shone in the afternoon light as we gazed up\
  \ at its many layers. I imagined each level as she spoke. Like the layers of a cake.\n\
  She described the process of building it; how the foundation was laid with weapons,\
  \ because to harm another creature was only to harm oneself. How the lowest layer\
  \ represented the lowest impulse of mankind.\n\u201CI\u2019m a Christian,\u201D\
  \ she assured me, looking into my blue eyes. \u201CYou can be Christian and also\
  \ practice the dharma, that\u2019s what\u2019s so great.\u201D\nI wasn\u2019t sure\
  \ if I was Christian or Buddhist or anything, but the idea of declaring both was\
  \ seductive in its own way. I considered her words as I walked around the golden\
  \ stupa. I was instructed to circle three times counter clockwise, and focus on\
  \ what I wanted to manifest.\nOn my second rotation, I stopped short. A black snake\
  \ was in my path.\nThe creature faltered. It\u2019s forked tongue made a momentary\
  \ appearance as it sized me up, tapping into every sense.\nThere was a mutual vulnerability\
  \ between the onyx creature and I. We watched one another carefully. Finally, the\
  \ silky body glided on. I smiled.\nDetermined to share this magical place, I returned\
  \ weeks later with a friend. I explained the base doctrines to her; \u201CAll life\
  \ is precious, you have to be careful not to harm any living thing. Leave the land\
  \ how it was, as if we were never here.\u201D\nShe nodded solemnly.\nI began my\
  \ counter-clockwise rotations around the sacred structure. In anticipation of insects\
  \ and smaller creatures, I had taken off my shoes and I walked lightly, watching\
  \ my path. I spotted a snail in front of me. I continued past the creature, over\
  \ the cement octagons beneath us.\nWhen I next rounded the path, I was met with\
  \ a simple horror.\nThere was a grey mass on the ground. Crushed shell and mangled,\
  \ oozing flesh.\nI glared at my friend as she walked barefoot ahead, unaware of\
  \ my gaze. The careless savagery of her bare skin crushing this helpless creature\
  \ took hold of my mind. The interconnectedness I was trying to foster with my surroundings\
  \ was heightened by this disrespect. \nI left the stupa and went to the grass. I\
  \ found a quarter from my wallet. I made an offering, apologizing for my mistake.\
  \ I grabbed my friend, and we left.\nAs I pulled up to my home, alone, hot tears\
  \ welled in my eyes."
