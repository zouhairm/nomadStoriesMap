Text: "It felt good to bleed. My eyes lingered on the tiny cuts strewn across my hand,\
  \ a trickle here and a trickle there of blood beginning to descend down my fingers.\
  \ I had been so wrapped up in my own head that I became unaware of how hard I was\
  \ swinging my machete like tool, determined to take out all of my frustrations on\
  \ the bush before me. I could only perceive myself as an impostor, a tourist in\
  \ someone else\u2019s reality. And yet that didn\u2019t appear to be the case for\
  \ the Rwandans whose faces I scanned and smiles I met. Sure, there were stares a\
  \ plenty; I must have looked mighty out of place and with each awkward swing of\
  \ my arms how could one not laugh at such an absurd sight. But their was a genuine\
  \ sense of camaraderie with every chuckle. I introduced myself to many people. Hands\
  \ were shook, jokes made, and stories shared. There was talk of college and soccer\
  \ and even after several brief moments of conversation, a true sense of friendship\
  \ was felt. Even so, my bare minimum involvement in Umuganda, Rwanda\u2019s national\
  \ day of public service, brought me a sense of shame, for myself and for America\
  \ as a whole. Where was our sense of national pride? Certainly not in the false\
  \ bravado of flag waving and overplayed chants of \u201CUSA, USA!\u201D We talk\
  \ of patriotism with cult-like endearment and yet look at service for the betterment\
  \ of our nation as a chore, as if helping one another might be considered un-american.\
  \ There is no hand holding, no striving for actual greatness. Just individualism\
  \ and a \u201Cbut how does this benefit me\u201D mentality. I wanted to scream and\
  \ cry out to each person who offered their thanks. Don\u2019t thank me for I have\
  \ done nothing worthy of your gratitude. But none of that mattered to the members\
  \ of the community who welcomed me in on my second day in the capital. This day\
  \ was not about me and it was selfish to think that any of my anger meant anything\
  \ to them. Umuganda was about Rwanda. It was about service to a country and I was\
  \ lucky to be a part of it. As I trudged up the hill towards my bus, I began to\
  \ feel present and take in the singing, the laughter, and the love that each person\
  \ expressed to their brothers and sisters. I was finally here, in every sense of\
  \ the word, ready to learn, to study, and to grow."
