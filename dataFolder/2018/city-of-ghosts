Text: "When she ascended the plane departing Egypt to KSA, she had known beforehand\
  \ that she is heading to a country that clashes badly with everything she loves.\
  \ But she had never imagined that KSA will be that lifeless\u2026worse than a house\
  \ of ghosts. Like dead bodies, everything in Riyadh is colorless: well, not exactly\
  \ colorless for you see women in black and men in white, but tell me: how can limiting\
  \ people\u2019s color options to two neutral colors reflect their spirit and give\
  \ expression to their essence of life \u2013 their character?! \nUnlike Cairo where\
  \ colorfully- dressed people stay up in the streets almost all night, those black\
  \ and white apparitions never leave their houses in Riyadh after ten o\u2019clock\
  \ leaving the city shrouded in silence. Similar to the panic you can experience\
  \ in a ghost house because of an unexpected shriek of a door, in Riyadh you may\
  \ feel terror at the middle of the night when you hear sirens of cars being stolen.\
  \ The police, like the doorman of a ghost house, will not even try to protect you\
  \ or your property for all what you hear will be something like: \u201CGod will\
  \ compensate you bro\u201D.\nGhost houses usually lure victims with their outstanding\
  \ architecture and mysterious nature. But Riyadh has nothing to seduce people with\
  \ other than those dirty papers known as money. Isn\u2019t it surprising that a\
  \ country that swims on petrol revenues does not use these resources to produce\
  \ any form of art or culture? There, you know that a house is built by a Saudi and\
  \ for a Saudi when you find that its architecture is completely plain and that the\
  \ window is so tiny. I imagine that from the inside, such houses are like tombs:\
  \ no sunlight, no fresh air. And though Saudis rank high regarding the percentages\
  \ of world obesity, they do not even have an outstanding cuisine! Where then can\
  \ you find any expression of life when there is almost no sense of art anywhere?!\
  \ \nSurprisingly however, one day, she was able to make a connection with an expression\
  \ of life. She was in the car stopping at a traffic light, when a Yemeni child knocked\
  \ the window asking for something to eat. The suffering in his eyes was so real\u2026\
  so real like life. It was so heavy too, like the harsh realities of this cruel life.\
  \ The unnecessary gratitude he had shown after she gave him biscuits reflected his\
  \ beautiful spirit.  He instantly reminded her of the tortured lives in Egypt: the\
  \ lives of street children all over the country paying the price of a corrupt political\
  \ system and a decaying society."
