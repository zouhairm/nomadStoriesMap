Text: "Traveling solo first and foremost invites you to The Edge. Along the way it\
  \ pushes, pulls, encourages, leads, and drags you there, but the decision to go\
  \ is an acceptance to an invitation. And The Edge morphs. Constantly.\n\nEarly on\
  \ in my solo round-the-world trip The Edge presented itself literally, in Queenstown,\
  \ New Zealand, and I walked to it willingly. A bungee jump. When the guide started\
  \ my countdown, I convinced myself not to think, just to run, and I parted ways\
  \ with the platform lamenting then accepting what could only be a mortal fate. That\
  \ terror transformed and I became saturated with elation in my flight, just before\
  \ the cord caught.\n\nThe Edge manifested in romance two months later, tugging me\
  \ back to Queenstown for a guy. I don\u2019t go back for guys, I run away from guys.\
  \ But this time, for this guy, back I went. Road-tripping through green and grey,\
  \ we stared out at emerald mountains and across turquoise waters, exploring with\
  \ abandon for four days before I kissed him goodbye and continued west.\n\n\LIn\
  \ Dalat, Vietnam, The Edge materialized as a motor scooter and a steep driveway.\
  \ If someone had been with me, I would have elected to leave my vehicle and walk.\
  \ But alone I casually shrugged off my instinct with a hint of condescension. I\
  \ made it three quarters of the way up before gravity claimed me, and I was lucky\
  \ to limp away with only a sprained ankle and a very bruised ego.\n\nMy favorite\
  \ incarnation of The Edge was in the Himalayas. I set out from Pokhara, Nepal on\
  \ a six-day trek that took me up and down and over and through the foothills. The\
  \ climax of the hike was sunrise over Annapurna South viewed from 3,400 meters up.\
  \ The most delicious shades of orange\u2014cantaloupe, apricot, peach\u2014 glowed\
  \ off of those peaks, and I found a spot away from the crowd to sit and gape at\
  \ the iconic mountain in the purest form of awe, through countless strands of windswept\
  \ prayer flags. I\u2019d learned what I was made of, what I was capable of.\n\n\
  The Edge is dichotomous. It is a place of skin-crawling, heart-pounding, stomach-dropping\
  \ discomfort, and a place of awe-inspiring, tear-inducing, ardent revelation. It\u2019\
  s challenge. It is opportunity. It is trust. It is an incubation period, however\
  \ long or short, from which you emerge a stronger, more amplified version of yourself.\
  \ For all the times The Edge has made me want to implode, I have always walked away\
  \ 1) alive (!), and 2) better off. Deciding to go on a solo trip around the world\
  \ invited me to The Edge. I accepted."
