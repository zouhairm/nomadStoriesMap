Text: "My time in Terra Australis is short, but my curiosity about everything in this\
  \ land has no end \u2013 I want to experience it all \u2013 above, below, and next\
  \ to me. \n\nAmbitiously (or naively) hoping to get acquainted with Australian flora\
  \ in its variety in just one afternoon, I enter the Botanical Gardens near Canberra.\
  \ \n\nWith eyes wide open I follow the guide as she strides ahead sharing secrets\
  \ of species that have quietly witnessed the changing of epochs for millions of\
  \ years. If I could only speak their language!\n\nWe disappear in  the rainforest\
  \ only to emerge soon after from the saving shade of the trees into the merciless\
  \ and seemingly naked desert of the heart of the continent. I linger a bit longer\
  \ trying to take some pictures in the blinding sunlight not sure I will ever make\
  \ it that close to the actual heart of Australia. \n\nThe tour comes to an end,\
  \ and I start my way back past the now familiar shrubs, ferns, and trees. I quiz\
  \ myself on what I have just learned trying to retain the knowledge I was entrusted\
  \ with.\n\nLost in thoughts about the nature\u2019s miracles, suddenly I find myself\
  \ in a world of lichen \u2013 all around me. Wait a minute, have I just stepped\
  \ into a secret grove of yet undiscovered species? In Australia that is still quite\
  \ possible. Mesmerized by the patterns and colors on the walls I come closer and\
  \ closer to these generally disregarded creations. Are they even real?  They are\
  \ and they are not \u2013 I entered an art exhibit inspired by these very lichen\
  \ and moss, a new world created in similitude of the one around us\u2026\n\nI realize\
  \ I am not alone here. Eyes meet eyes \u2013 here is the creator! And the eyes reveal\
  \ more than I can express verbally, so she instantly recognizes a fellow art addict\
  \ \u2013 one can only conceal their true nature for that long. I still treasure\
  \ my recent acquaintance with banksia tree and wollemi pine, but there is nothing\
  \ like meeting a fellow human being across the world you connect so easily with.\
  \ I can\u2019t miss the chance to see an artist in her natural habitat, so leaving\
  \ the rules of reserved civility behind I invite myself to her studio.\n\nTwo days\
  \ later I am where the worlds are being created. We talk about what inspires us\
  \ and the freedom of artistic creation. I listen, watch, and start to believe that\
  \ maybe it is in this studio outside Canberra that I am in the true heart of Australia\
  \ \u2013 I can hear it beating here."
