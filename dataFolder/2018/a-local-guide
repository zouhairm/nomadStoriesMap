Text: "A LOCAL GUIDE:\nIt was early in the morning as the sun rises, songs of birds\
  \ awake you; the parrots, eagles, owls, sunbirds and many other calls.\nIt was in\
  \ Narok county in Nguruman forest, we had been hiking through the forest for 8days\
  \ and we had a layover day close to a river.  Though the place was dry, alongside\
  \ the river everything was green and a lot of life.\nI had just on this trip been\
  \ interested in identifying birds and noticed that Kenya has the 2nd most species\
  \ of birds in the world.  So far I had so many in my list I knew but not by names.\n\
  So one morning I decided to wake up early armed with borrowed binoculars and a bird\
  \ book by Terry Peterson.  I left the tent at around 6.20a.m, the best time for\
  \ birding.  Everybody else was a sleep.\nAs I left my tent, I was met by a slim\
  \ young man holding a spear, a club (Rungu) and with a sword on his waist.  His\
  \ smile made me feel safe and welcome.\nHe was a maasai herds man who was up early\
  \ to take his cows in such of green pastures. Obviously the group of tents attracted\
  \ him to the camp.\nHe greeted me in his maasai language and a I responded Sopa!\
  \ My maasai language was close to non.\nI could tell that the young man could not\
  \ communicate in Kiswahili or English as he kept talking to me in maasai language\
  \ \u201CKimaa\u201D.\nHe spotted my birds book and took it from my hands, started\
  \ flipping through the book and he would point to the right bird.Thus he could identify\
  \ a bird in the book and show it to me in real.\nTwo hours later as the sun started\
  \ heating up and life slowed down, birds went quiet not much on flight, animals\
  \ hide in shade etc.  I had identified 20 species of birds within 4hectares of land.\
  \ \nThe young man had forgotten about his cows but they were moving about in the\
  \ bushes browsing along. \nI could tell that the young man was happy to help me.\
  \ I was very happy as well and this made me realize how much communication can be\
  \ done without talking.\nIt was a morning of learning, From then on I became an\
  \ early bird watcher and to date I owe this  young man my knowledge of birds\nUnfortunately,\
  \ I never got to see him again since I could not ask which boma he came from.  But\
  \ I really appreciated the knowledge of that young man.\nCurrently I have over 450\
  \ species of birds in east Africa that I can identify."
