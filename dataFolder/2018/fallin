Text: "On April 1st in 2016 the biggest fool stumbling around was me. Back then I\
  \ knew shit about what would happen that same night.\nI finished work as usual and\
  \ headed out with my coworker and dear friend Anna. Little did we know how long\
  \ it would actually take us to get to the first bar, but that\u2019s a whole different\
  \ story. This one is about you. You and your stupidly charming smile.\nThe moment\
  \ I saw you in that narrow corner out on the balcony of Toff\u2019s my body filled\
  \ up with this weird urge. The urge to talk to you, to get to know you. I simply\
  \ couldn\u2019t resist the smile on your face. So I dropped a line, started the\
  \ conversation and at the same time a whole new chapter of my life. The last thing\
  \ I expected that night was to fall in love. \nWell to be completely honest, I didn\u2019\
  t. We had the most amazing night together. Talking, dancing - kissing. Kissing out\
  \ on that balcony we just met a few hours ago. Kissing until they threw us out way\
  \ after closing time. I was all yours, and still I wasn\u2019t. It all happened\
  \ so quickly. Way too fast. You were only in town for a few days, but hell these\
  \ days meant a lot to me. As quickly as it started our time together ended. You\
  \ took that plane back home. Back to Darwin. 4000 kilometres away from me.\nHow\
  \ in the world did that happen? How did I end up being the one left behind? Leaving\
  \ is my speciality. That started me thinking, was it time to go? Time to leave the\
  \ city that became my home over the last four months? It certainly felt like it.\
  \ So I packed up my things and headed off to a place that's never been on the list\
  \ before. Good ol\u2019 Tassie. \nYou know how people always say they\u2019re gonna\
  \ travel the world to find themselves. Well, I thought I didn\u2019t need to do\
  \ that, that I knew who I was. Turns out I didn\u2019t. The overwhelming beauty\
  \ of Tasmania took me back to my roots. Slowed down my pace. Healed my soul.\nWhile\
  \ reaching the top of Mount Amos I also reached my inner safe spot. I was at pure\
  \ peace with the world and myself. That\u2019s when I figured it all out. I was\
  \ supposed to meet you. You were supposed to leave, to push me onto this journey.\
  \ In that exact moment I fell for you. \nIf it wasn\u2019t for you I would have\
  \ never reached that place, never met all the lovely people on the way. You showed\
  \ me the beauty of your country, your people and myself. And even though you broke\
  \ my heart by leaving me, I\u2019m so damn grateful that you did. Cause I didn\u2019\
  t only fall in love with you, but your - and by now I\u2019d like to believe MY\
  \ - country."
