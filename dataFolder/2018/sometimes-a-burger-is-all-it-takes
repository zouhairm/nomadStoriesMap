Text: "After a few months on the road, I was feeling a bit tired of moving around\
  \ and wanted to slow down for a while. I missed my family and friends back home\
  \ terribly and didn't want to see yet another temple. Due to that, I was back in\
  \ one of my favourite places in the world, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Many backpackers\
  \ find the city a bit boring and like any other big city in Asia. But I always loved\
  \ the mix of different cultures and all the delicious food with influences from\
  \ mainly India and China mixed with the local cuisine. It's not unusual hearing\
  \ a conversation mixing 3 languages at the same time making the city truly multicultural.\n\
  \nUnlike many other Asian countries, I never feel like a walking wallet in Malaysia,\
  \ locals seem to depend on tourism far less than in other places. This evening I\
  \ was taking a stroll around Chinatown looking at the lost tourists walking around\
  \ with big backpack searching for a place to stay the night, locals selling food\
  \ and migrant workers flogging random things at the market. \n\nI was trying to\
  \ find a place to eat. Most of the places seemed to be already filled with people\
  \ and I didn't feel like waiting for my food with the crowd so I decided to go for\
  \ the street food option instead. At the end of the street, I could see this guy\
  \ setting up his stall for the night, selling hamburgers. There was no queue yet\
  \ so I could get my food quickly and then head home. The burgers in Malaysia are\
  \ a bit different from what I'm used to if you order the special you get them with\
  \ egg and cheese. The egg is fried really thin and sort of wrapped around the burger\
  \ with chilli sauce and mayo on the inside. Quite messy to eat but really delicious.\n\
  \nWhen I approached the seller he broke out into a big grin and ask me how I was\
  \ doing and started talking about my job. It turns out that he remembered me from\
  \ my last visit to the city, one and a half years ago. As I walked home to my hostel\
  \ with my burger I did it with a big smile on my face. I still missed my family\
  \ and friends but being recognized by a stranger made me feel I grounded and connected\
  \ to the world around me."
