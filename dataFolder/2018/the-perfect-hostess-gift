Text: "I watched Erika\u2019s round face crumple before she hid it behind her hands,\
  \ but I didn\u2019t know how to tell her this wasn\u2019t her fault. She left the\
  \ room before I did. I took my tear-stained face to bed, sleeping uneasily. \n\n\
  Before travelling to Aomori, Japan my eighth-grade classmates and I were informed\
  \ that gift-giving is an important part of Japanese culture. Dutifully I\u2019d\
  \ packed my suitcase with blueberry jam and maple syrup from my hometown in Maine\
  \ for every member of my multi-generation host family. But upon arrival I quickly\
  \ realized that my hand-picked items were no bigger than trinkets compared to the\
  \ experience I was given. My host sister and I sipped brightly bitter green tea\
  \ in a traditional ceremony, sampled sushi, and fed koi fish that leaped so ferociously\
  \ from their pond I prayed I wouldn\u2019t lose my fingers. We laughed through the\
  \ awkwardness of hand gestures and broken languages. We struggled to stay awake\
  \ while watching sumo-wrestling, and splattered mud everywhere while we planting\
  \ rice.\n\nThese experiences were gifts that could never be reciprocated. But another\
  \ important aspect of Japanese culture is being a perfect host. Erika repeatedly\
  \ showered me with presents which I accepted even though I had nothing else to give\
  \ her. The unequal exchange didn\u2019t seem to matter to her as long as I was happy.\
  \ Hosting a guest was a serious matter and my comfort was priority.\n\nOn our last\
  \ night students and families celebrated loudly in the Nebuta Museum Wa Rasse. The\
  \ taiko drums we beat reverberated through the floor to the core of our bodies,\
  \ sticks rebounding in the air as high as our arms could reach after each stroke\
  \ on the massive instruments. The painted warriors decorating the illuminated parade\
  \ floats around us shook until it seemed the soldiers would ripple off their thin\
  \ paper as fiercely as their expressions suggested. We wore short robes and hachimaki\
  \ headbands, and took pictures making the peace sign. My head double-timed with\
  \ a migraine, my first, until I was near tears.\n\nInevitably my pale face and wan,\
  \ brave smile couldn\u2019t escape Erika\u2019s attention. My family was the first\
  \ to leave the festivities. I didn\u2019t cry until we stood in their shallow living\
  \ room and I struggled to swallow medicine. Erika looked as though she\u2019d failed\
  \ me, as if that was possible.\n\nThe next evening we hugged and promised to write\
  \ before parting. I repeatedly said \u201Cdomo arigatou gozaimasu\u201D, the words\
  \ for \u201Cthank you\u201D, which weren\u2019t nearly enough to convey my gratitude."
