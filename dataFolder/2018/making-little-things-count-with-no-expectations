Text: "Travelling to every Youth's Dream Manali. \nTravelling made me feel better\
  \ than ever, went  on with the vibe to travel with something more than i thought\
  \ so. Life came to a time when you have to make decisions whether to say no to the\
  \ boundaries you have within yourselves. I started my journey just like some normal\
  \ traveller but made my journey a lesson to count on. Travelling is just like being\
  \ with the people who just travel with some strings attached. I boarded my train\
  \ just before the train was about to leave,searching for my seat and there we go\
  \ found it. Started my journey to delhi from vizag  with some strangers and some\
  \ connections to be made with some food involved. Stations coming waiting for my\
  \ co-passengers and after some time the wait was over. A family consisting of 4\
  \ people mother,  father and 2 childrens overwhelmed as it was there first trip\
  \ by train. They were playing with the switches and going up and down by the seats.\
  \ I introduced about myself and the chat went long and on for another 2 days with\
  \ food and some love. Got to know how it feels to travel first time by train with\
  \ your family. Reached delhi and took an auto to bus stand as i needed to board\
  \ the bus to manali. Reaching bus stand the first thing i did was to have some tea\
  \ by the road side vendor. It was quite freezing as it was december and December\
  \ in delhi is like no body part of yours should be exposed to the atmosphere. Boarded\
  \ my bus which was an government road transport as its easy to find local people\
  \ and see their culture, their clothing style, their language. Met some people of\
  \ manali, and asked about different places to visit, best way to travel in manali\
  \ and all. Reached manali by the hilly areas and many curving roads with beautiful\
  \ scenic beauty. After reaching manali i took an auto to my hostel and met the owner\
  \ of the hostel and went to my room, it was - 9 in the night. Next day i went to\
  \ solang valley with the joy of seeing and feeling the snow for the first time.\
  \ Ate maggie their and made some talks with the local people. For the first time\
  \ in my life i was about to try para gliding and i was scared to death. I reached\
  \ the top of the mountain by ropeway. After reaching to top of the mountain, the\
  \ beauty, the snow, the mountain, the nature, the birds and all the things which\
  \ my eyes were able to capture was just incredibly beautiful. After seeing that,\
  \ i was just emotional it changed my life and way of experiencing it. It truly was\
  \ life changing. Peace!"
