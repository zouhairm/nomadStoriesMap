Text: "It looks exactly the same, but not quite. Just like they said it would. \n\
  My whole body shakes and my stomach churns. I close my eyes, focus on holding back\
  \ my lunch - egg salad sandwich extra mayo - and hold onto the ramp outside the\
  \ exit. In hindsight I definitely should\u2019ve skipped the mayo.\n\nI recall the\
  \ handsome attendant, Miko, telling me before I left: \u201CIt\u2019s a standard\
  \ reaction for first timers Miss, you\u2019ll feel nauseous but it'll pass soon\
  \ after you land. Oh don\u2019t worry, Instra Technology is now GRA approved, and\
  \ thanks to our latest update, we guarantee transfers without risk of biological\
  \ or psychological side effects\u201D. I know what you\u2019re thinking: it\u2019\
  s not exactly reassuring. But hey, thousands make the trip everyday, there\u2019\
  s nothing to worry about, really; so l got aboard Jasper. Instra stands for Instant\
  \ Transmission and Jasper is the train\u2019s name - silly name for a device that\
  \ shakes you at the speed of light, right?\n\nThe nausea passes, as Miko said, so\
  \ I open my eyes and let go of the ramp: I\u2019m the last one out. I look around\
  \ again at the orange and yellow London Plane trees, lining up the almost deserted\
  \ Grand Canal Square. I see the old Bord Gais theatre\u2019s angular glass and steel\
  \ panels, dirty, standing big to my right. The notorious red poles are also there\
  \ in front of it, sticking out of the red pavement, like a red carpet stretching\
  \ from the theatre all the way to the canal. A chilly wind blows in the Square and\
  \ the sun hides behind the clouds. It\u2019s Dublin alright, exactly as I left it.\
  \ \n\nBut not quite. Everything's how to say \u2026 a hue stronger? A barely noticeable\
  \ neon-y tint, but it\u2019s there in the yellow of the leaves and the red of the\
  \ poles, even in the sky\u2019s usually dull grey. \u201CSo\u201D, I tell myself,\
  \ \u201C that\u2019s what a parallel world looks like\u201D. I also see it in the\
  \ girl's metallic blue eyes. A 28 year old with long silver hair who had said she\
  \ would wait for me for in the square but now ran to me, her fair face horrified.\
  \ She doesn\u2019t say a word but I know she wants me to run back inside. I know\
  \ this because I know her. She\u2019s me. I feel all that she feels, the panic ....\
  \ the sense that it\u2019s too late, but too late for what? \n\nThere's a blow to\
  \ my head. I try to hold on back to the ramp, but start falling forward. As I\u2019\
  m going under, I see the neon blue of her pupils fade and her eyes close at the\
  \ same time as mine, in slow motion. And right before I go completely dark, I remember\
  \ thinking that well, this just didn\u2019t go quite like they said it would."
