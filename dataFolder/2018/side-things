Text: "The last thing I expected was to see a cowman with a penis that small. \nHe\
  \ must not have realized, in good enough time, that I was, in fact, a woman. Few\
  \ people do, to be fair, not when there\u2019s enough distance between us, and certainly\
  \ not when I\u2019m dressed in khaki that straightens out my, ahem, cough cough,\
  \ modern African womanliness (id est, A-cup breasts and a slight rise where strong\
  \ and bouncy African breasts and bums should be). \nBy the time the cowman was close\
  \ enough to see my face, I was also close enough to see his penis. \nHe quickly\
  \ bent forward and put his hands over his crotch, as if he were anticipating a free\
  \ kick. The children that were bathing in the river, with him, shrieked. They started\
  \ to laugh and point at me. I smiled at the cowman, who smiled back at me, and then\
  \ I averted my eyes. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw him scramble and disappear\
  \ behind some papyrus on the other side of the river. \n\u2018Wow!\u2019 I said.\n\
  \u2018What was that?\u2019 Sherry said. She was just now crossing the wide, dusty\
  \ road.  \n\u2018Did you guys see that?\u2019 I said. \n\u2018See what? Sherry asked.\
  \ \n\u2018That guy, in the river, with his, uhm, business?\u2019\n\u2018There\u2019\
  s a Toro Olive Greenbul there,\u2019 Val shouts. He\u2019s looking through his binoculars\
  \ while simultaneously pointing at a clump of shrubs.\n\u2018Yes, I heard it already,\u2019\
  \ I said. \u2018There\u2019s also a Little Greenbul. But didn\u2019t you guys see\
  \ that guy, in the river? He was right there!\u2019\n\u2018What about him?\u2019\
  \ Val asked.  \n\u2018Never mind,\u2019 I said. \n\u2018What?\u2019 Val insisted.\
  \ \n\u2018Unbelievable. The man was right there!\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019m the only\
  \ man here.\u2019 Val gestured at the children in the river and said, \u2018Those?\
  \ Those are boys.\u2019 \nI rolled my eyes. \u2018Whatever, man.\u2019\nLarge-irised\
  \ Sherry and size-six Adam-appled Val exchanged a look, shrugged, and started to\
  \ walk away. \nIf I hadn\u2019t met them on the dark-brown spine along last July\u2019\
  s margin\u2014\nIf they hadn\u2019t offered me a gig at one of those expatriate-ridden\
  \ parties were people discuss the merits of microwave-able American Garden popcorn\
  \ in the same tone that they discuss cholera outbreaks\u2014\nIf they hadn\u2019\
  t taken me in when I was in desperate need of sun-bitten furniture and fresh mint\
  \ and black-eyed Suzans and double-decker portmanteaux (all four of which they willingly\
  \ offered, before I even asked) \u2014\n\u2018\u2014Gio, are you coming?\u2019 Val\
  \ asked. \n\u2018We need your ear. Is that a Green Hylia calling?\u2019 Sherry continued.\
  \ \n\u2018For heaven\u2019s sake, you people! Don\u2019t you listen? I already said\
  \ there\u2019s a Green Hylia somewhere here.\u2019"
