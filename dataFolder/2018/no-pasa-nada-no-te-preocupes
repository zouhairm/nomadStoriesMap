Text: "It was mid-October when I moved to Granada in Spain from the UK for mobility.\
  \ It was chilly and arrived around half past eight. My Spanish friend, Bea, picked\
  \ me up from the bus station and brought me to our flat. She left and told me she\u2019\
  d come back after three weeks.  Three weeks?! I had cold feet. Before she left,\
  \ she said, \u201CRemember: No pasa nada. No te preocupes. Nothing is happening.\
  \ Nothing to worry.\u201D I smiled mechanically, and as if by magic, she disappeared\
  \ at the sound of the door closing. \n\nAlone, I realized how dated our flat was,\
  \ how dark. There were four rooms for each of my flatmates and me. I chose the middle\
  \ room because the light of day seemed to visit it first. As I\u2019m from the East,\
  \ I would always want to be reminded of my position: wherever the sun and the moon\
  \ rise. \nOnly three weeks of being alone. Only three. I remember telling myself\
  \ over and over. I checked the flat from corner to corner. The living room had a\
  \ circular table with a plastic table cloth. The couch was old. There was a telly\
  \ but no internet.  What?! No Internet!! Panic began to rise. \n\nNo pasa nada.\
  \ No te preocupes.\n\nAs the night deepened, my body began to shiver. How come the\
  \ radiator does not work? I checked the shower for warm water. A few moments later,\
  \ the water was still icy. I was ready to cry. How will I take a shower tonight?\
  \ Tomorrow morning? I ran into the kitchen there was a small electric kettle. \n\
  The following day, I heard someone shouting, \u201CButano! Butano!\u201D Who is\
  \ Butano? Is he my neighbour? I wondered what he looked like. I called my friend\
  \ in the Philippines and I complained about not having internet and heater, that\
  \ maybe I made a mistake in choosing Spain.  She asked, \u201CHow many people got\
  \ a chance to experience Spain in both its beauty and pain?\u201D I felt ashamed.\
  \ \n\nI refocused my attention to finding solution. I went out and looked for a\
  \ shop that sold pail and dipper. I found a Chinese shop and in it, my treasures.\
  \ I went back to the flat, boiled water from the kettle 3x and took a bath.\n\n\
  It was only until my flatmates came that I learned that butano was not our neighbor.\
  \ He was not a person being called every 6 in the morning without a miss. Instead,\
  \ it was the missing piece that would make the radiator work and the warm water\
  \ to come out of the shower. I could have married butano if only for the warmth.\
  \ \n\nBut, No pasa nada. No te preocupes. \n\nThe last thing I expected was finding\
  \ the saying true. Since then, it has always been my mantra."
