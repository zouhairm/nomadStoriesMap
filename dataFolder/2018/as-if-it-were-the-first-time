Text: "I spent the days before the departure thinking about what could be useful and\
  \ what certainly would not have come with me. I then selected 15/20 kg of stuff\
  \ that I had placed in the backpack that, with the computer as hand luggage and\
  \ an immaculate white notebook, constituted my equipment for the trip.\nSince I\
  \ had known, I had not expected anything but the moment of departure. I was impatient,\
  \ knowing that after that seventeen hours of flight, the doors of what would have\
  \ been an unforgettable experience would be opened up to me. During the flight I\
  \ remember that I was having absurd thoughts for how I was excited and euphoric.\n\
  I was feeling invincible. Heroic. I was enjoying the idea of being alone, heading\
  \ to a new place where I did not know anyone. I could be so different from what\
  \ I was in Bologna, and I was committing to imagine myself in one way or another.\
  \ After all, I could have played any kind of card, I could have reinvented a personality\
  \ entirely. Rebuild myself from scratch as I would wished.\nThe charm of a new personality\
  \ was beautifully, overwhelming.\nI was seeing around me foreign people who, even\
  \ if I did not know them I could imagine their families, with their friends. However,\
  \ I could barely perceive what my new life might be like.\nI was like an object\
  \ suspended in the air, without place, but free in the hands of anyone. Observing\
  \ Kerouac's book, \"On the Road\" that I held proudly in my hands, as a proof of\
  \ my intellectual level. Every now and then, when I happened to meet another traveler's\
  \ eyes, I moved the book slightly in the foreground to point out, with the hope\
  \ that someone would see what kind of subject I was. It is strange, but departing\
  \ alone makes you more responsible and instinctive at the same time. Responsible\
  \ for your irrationality.\nThe last thing I expected was to leave for a 14-day travel\
  \ writing trip to Argentina. \nThis was the beginning of everything. \nThe beginning\
  \ of a life experience that have indelibly determined the meeting between two of\
  \ my great passions: travel and writing.\nUpon arrival I was destroyed by exhaustion\
  \ but very excited, as curious as ever before.\nEverything is different at different\
  \ latitudes. It therefore becomes useless to bring your own knowledge and convictions.\
  \ It is essential to discover new vocabularies and different ways of thinking.\n\
  It's important to be amazed.\nAs if it were the first time.\nBecause the ritual\
  \ of the unexpected, although repeated many times, It's unknown each time."
