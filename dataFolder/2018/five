Text: "My story is based on a character, in which life comes down to the daily routine\
  \ that every human being faces to \"survive\" in the human jungle. \"Five\" portrays\
  \ a surreal story based on the human condition that exists today, where every second,\
  \ every number, every geometry, every musical tone and every mathematical detail\
  \ is applied in the obligatory change that the \"Will\" of change forces.\n\nIn\
  \ terms of story, it is also a person who tires easily of his city life and habitual\
  \ search for a life goal. This character, thus begins a search for something he\
  \ does not know, so he receives a strange letter with a curious message that awakens\
  \ him to this quest. On this trip, she leaves her comfort in Portugal and embarks\
  \ on a trip to Iceland and ends the same in Argentina where all the answers seem\
  \ to cohabit.\n\nSomething will change her forever as soon as she realizes the true\
  \ meaning of life. This is not a love story but a story about the love as human\
  \ being with other little things around us, that usually we dont realize.\nThis\
  \ Story is a thriller, and suspense drama all over the time, with surreal caractheres,\
  \ such as animal that speak, using the actual politic envolvement around the world\
  \ and his mafias. \n\nFive, it will thus be a metaphorical and surrealistic tale\
  \ that will spark changes of consciousness of what we have really been and what\
  \ we really are. A frontier between math, coincidence, will, travel, and .. be a\
  \ simple human."
