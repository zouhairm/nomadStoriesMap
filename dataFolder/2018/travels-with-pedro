Text: "\u201CBecky, if you are cold, put your hands in my pockets,\u201D Pedro yelled\
  \ through the wind while patting his sides. \n I slid my hands into his pockets\
  \ as we swooped through the cold desert extremities of downtown Marrakech on his\
  \ moped. We passed through a sparse and sandy tract of land, stippled with palm\
  \ trees and Berbers selling camel rides. Flanking the horizon, the immense Atlas\
  \ mountains dissolved into the rainy sky.  \n Originally, I had arrived at my Riad\
  \ ready to pay, but Pedro pushed the colorful money away and insisted I go to tea\
  \ with him instead. Money, he explained, made him nervous. I accepted Pedro\u2019\
  s spontaneous liking to me and consented to a breakneck tour of Marrakech by an\
  \ Arab local, even one with a Spanish nom de plume. \n We loped through the narrow\
  \ derbs and keyhole arches of the medina. One doorstep was spattered with glistening\
  \ chicken guts for the stray cats to eat. Pedro was amused by my shock. Mopeds trumpeted\
  \ through the crowded alleys. \n \u201CIn Morocco, right side of street is safest,\u201D\
  \ Pedro cautioned. \n The souks were dim, reeking of leather, exhaust,and steaming\
  \ tajine. Donkey carts bustled by and merchants dangled glowing lanterns. Pedro\
  \ fed me sugary candies pulled from his backpack. In the murky light, colorful pyramids\
  \ of spices glowed. \n When Pedro spoke, I smiled dumbly. His english was so broken\
  \ that whatever conversation we shared was, by necessity, a joint charade. Still,\
  \ after mint tea poured fountain-like from a Berber\u2019s silver teapot, Pedro\
  \ whisked me away to his parent\u2019s home.   \n \u201CEnter! It is your house,\u201D\
  \ he exclaimed.  \n I was delightfully confused. Was this an elaborate form of foreign\
  \ hospitality, or was I tacitly consenting to marriage? His father lavished me with\
  \ breads, soups, and beans slathered in a yellow sauce. Pedro taught me to wipe\
  \ the remaining soup from the bowl with middle and forefinger, while snagging crumbs\
  \ with the thumb, then sucked his fingers clean. \n He slung me onto his moped and\
  \ we were off to the desert, then through an eroded brick arch and back into the\
  \ steaming, cacophonous medina. We weaved through veiled throngs and the bobbing\
  \ cowls of peaked djellabas, around cramped corners tiled in koranic arabesques,\
  \ and past mud walls layered in florid rugs. It was harrowing and exhilarating.\
  \   \n When we skidded to a halt back at the Riad, I struggled to express my dazed\
  \ euphoria. Pedro waved me off, insisting I still pay later, but I was no longer\
  \ sure I could adequately pay him back at all."
