Text: "Travel to Myanmar had been one of my dreams for years. Yes, it was those beautiful\
  \ pictures of temples in a green field that made that to me (just write Myanmar\
  \ in Google Pictures - you\u2019ll know what I\u2019m talking about). Those pictures\
  \ are in Bagan, but for now, let\u2019s talk about Yangon, the biggest and ancient\
  \ capital of the country. \n\nI finally put my feet in burmese soil in November\
  \ of 2017. I really didn\u2019t know what I was going to find, once the country\
  \ faces conflicts between muslims and Buddhists near the Bangladesh borders. And\
  \ although the news made me heartbronken, what I found in Myanmar was pure magic.\
  \ Temples of more than 2 thousand years. A gentle and kind people. Buddhist relics.\
  \ Beautiful sunny days. \n\nAnd one thing that I was eager to do: take the circulas\
  \ train line. It goes around all Yangon and small cities nearby. During three hours.\
  \ In the 40 celsius degree weather. No air conditioning, of course - this is not\
  \ a touristic line, it's just the normal train people take everyday to come and\
  \ go. It seamed easy - the Central Station was just a few blocks from my hotel.\
  \ Got ready. Took my water bottle. Stepped out of the door...\n\nJust to find a\
  \ massive crowd of burmese people frolicking on the sidewalks. Then in the streets\
  \ and avenues nearby. I was in the city centre and I have completely forgotten.\
  \ That was the day Pope Francis was set to visit Myanmar. 27th November of 2017.\
  \ At that time, being in Asia and immersed in Buddhist and Hindu culture for a few\
  \ weeks, I had completely forgotten the Pope's visit. And it was happening right\
  \ in front of me.\n\nEverybody were happy and excited, taking the streets - I never\
  \ thought I would see this joy for the arrival of a Catholic leader in a mostly\
  \ Buddhist country. I do not consider myself Catholic either. But I felt that kind\
  \ of emotion that you can only feel when you are in large crowds. Rock concerts.\
  \ World Cup Games (well, well, I'm Brazilian). The police opened space on the streets\
  \ and the car carrying the Pope passed by. With the windows open. And he looked\
  \ at me. I lost the photo, but I have the memory.\n\nI smiled. I lost my train.\
  \ \n\n(It was ok, I took the next one anyway)."
