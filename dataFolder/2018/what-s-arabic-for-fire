Text: "After coming home, showering and feasting on a sumptuous meal of muesli bars,\
  \ Janet and I were watching a film when all of a sudden a flame caught my eye. It\
  \ came from the electrical socket at the back of the headboard behind the bedside\
  \ table. Quick thinking meant we shifted the furniture from the flaming area and\
  \ rung reception to explain the situation. This was where the real drama began.\n\
  \nMe: \"Hello?\u201D\nHotel: \u201CRec\u201D crackle \u201Ception\u201D\nMe: Hello,\
  \ I\u2019m from Room 807. We have a fire.\nHotel: I\u2019ll send someone up.\nWe\
  \ waited patiently for 20 minutes.\n\nHotel: Reception.\nMe: Yes we called about\
  \ a fire in our room and someone was going to come and check.\nHotel: Yes\nMe: They\
  \ haven\u2019t turned up.\nHotel: Okay, I will send someone.\nThis time a man turned\
  \ up to \u2018help\u2019 us. He spoke no English and we spoke no Arabic to explain\
  \ the fire. My gesturing and my pointing and Janet\u2019s pointing and gesturing\
  \ didn\u2019t help. We called Reception asking them to translate to the man. It\
  \ was a good plan, a well-planned plan, and would have worked should it not have\
  \ been for the man at Reception or for the man in our room. We relayed the problem,\
  \ passed the phone to the man in our room, but Reception had hung up.\nThe man in\
  \ the room called for back up, but he didn\u2019t speak English. After playing with\
  \ the lights, they said \u201CYes, yes\u201D and left.  Clearly this whole farcical\
  \ process wasn\u2019t dealt with so we called Reception, only to be put on hold\
  \ where we listened to the man on the other end breathing.  He finally talked asking\
  \ \u201CWake Up Call?\" No! We don\u2019t want a wake up call. We had a fire!\n\n\
  We went down to Reception. Checking he understood us, we explained the problem and\
  \ the two men coming to our room but not understanding what they were looking for\
  \ due to the language barrier and we asked if our room could be checked out. We\
  \ were told to go up as someone would come and look into this for us, but that it\
  \ was quite safe in our room. Really? Had he seen the flames?\n\nFinally two other\
  \ men turned up and checked our switchboard. I\u2019m no expert, but I was a little\
  \ apprehensive when the man began digging around the socket with his screwdriver\
  \ and I almost passed out with shock when he pulled out one of the wires and it\
  \ was alight. I had visions of calling Reception and them asking us if we needed\
  \ a Wake Up Call, which, if the man had been electrocuted, probably would have been\
  \ useful. Of course I\u2019m not sure how reliable that would have been.\n\nAt least\
  \ I have learnt one word while being here \u062D\u0631\u064A\u0642 (Nar)"
