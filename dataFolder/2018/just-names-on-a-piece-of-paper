Text: "Back in 2005 I was one of those lucky teenagers who got to experience life\
  \ abroad. Having had a tourism visa denied just the year before, for no reason at\
  \ all, was a sign that a trip to Disney wouldn't have that much of an impact on\
  \ my life. I am from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and at the time being a foreign exchange\
  \ student wasn't as popular as it is nowadays.  \n\nThere is so much more than just\
  \ deciding on doing something like that. It is a ritual and you have to prepare\
  \ yourself for the moment when you will finally get to fly solo. I was 16 when the\
  \ preparation began. First, with the help of the exchange program agency, you decide\
  \ on where to go, the duration of the program and create a profile with pictures\
  \ and information about yourself. Then you wait...wait...wait... until a host family\
  \ picks you. While you wait, you participate in group dynamics and talks with psychologists\
  \ all to make the transition easier, but the reality is: nothing can really get\
  \ you ready for what is coming, since each experience is unique.\n\nDuring the months\
  \ prior the trip, it is extremely normal to freak out and have second thoughts about\
  \ the whole thing. Even your parents will feel that way, trust me. I suppose it\
  \ it never easy letting your kids go out and unveil the world on their own. Well,\
  \ at that moment everything is lining up, you book your plane ticket with no destination\
  \ as you still have no clue where you are going to end up. And then you get a call\
  \ from the agency saying that they have found you a family and you freak out a little\
  \ more.\n\nAt that stage, when you think things are finally settled, fear takes\
  \ over. \"What if I don't get along with my future family?\" \"What if the city\
  \ is a dump?\" \"What if I die of boredom?\" \"What if I don't make any friends?\"\
  \ Well, move on, because it is time to go. \n\nSaying goodbye can be tough and you\
  \ are consciously aware that you are leaving your comfort zone for uncertainty.\
  \ If you are a communicative person as I assume you are, on your flight there your\
  \ mind is filled with expectations about the people who were once just names on\
  \ a piece of paper and that you have come to know a little and will get to live\
  \ with for months to come.\n\nI have lived for 29 years and the decision of moving\
  \ abroad is the one that I hold dear to my heart. At a young age I got to experience\
  \ another culture and the singularities of different people and those things made\
  \ me grow and be a better person; that can never be taken away from me."
