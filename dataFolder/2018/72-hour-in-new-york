Text: "Arriving in New York City in the middle of the night was a little overwhelming,\
  \ especially after almost 26 hours of flying. It was our first time out of Australia,\
  \ so everything was a little overwhelming, yet exciting.  We were not tired so hit\
  \ the pavement to start exploring and find somewhere to eat.  I had always wanted\
  \ to see Times Square, more so in winter than in autumn, but who cares, I was here,\
  \ living a life-long dream.  We spent the next six hours just walking around, mouths\
  \ agape at the buildings, lights and people.  Eventually we went to our hotel to\
  \ get some rest.  \nIn the 72 hours, we spent in NYC. we ate at diners, Italian\
  \ restaurants and The Hard Rock Caf\xE9.  We took a tour over the Brooklyn Bridge,\
  \ sailed the Hudson River by the light of a full moon and visited the 911 Memorial.\
  \  We walked Times Square so many times during our stay.  There is so much to see\
  \ and do, and at every turn, there is something different happening.  We watched\
  \ many street performers, dancers, artists and different characters.  Even the Pan\
  \ Handlers are entertaining some of the time.  I had one chase me down the street\
  \ abusing me because I did not give him a dollar for taking his photo, I had simply\
  \ taken it because I thought the wording of his sign was funny.  Never did that\
  \ again.  Walking around the streets one night, we came police barricades everywhere,\
  \ police vehicles and police, all armed.  We asked an onlooker what was going on,\
  \ they replied \u201Coh just a shooting, the police\u201D.  Right, just a shooting!\
  \  \nOn our last day, we took a ferry across to Liberty Island and explored the\
  \ Statue of Liberty, fed squirrels in the park at the ferry terminal, before taking\
  \ a bus back uptown to Central Park. A horse and carriage ride around the park was\
  \ my number one must do when coming the NYC.  We had a great time, our driver was\
  \ fantastic and told us so much about the city.  \nLater we walked, I don\u2019\
  t know how many blocks back down to the Helen Hayes Theatre, where we were seeing\
  \ a Broadway Show, another must on visiting New York.  My choice of show was Rock\
  \ of Ages, and it was fantastic. After the show, I got to meet the actors and have\
  \ my photo taken with them.  We flew out the next day to begin the next part of\
  \ our American holiday."
