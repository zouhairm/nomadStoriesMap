Text: "It was my very first time traveling alone so far from home. It was the best\
  \ choice for me in that moment .I had the opportunity to experience myself and discover\
  \ a lot more about my personal boundaries. \nI\u2019ve already let behind my shoulders\
  \ the natural power of the Cataratas de Iguazu and I was traveling to San Ignacio\
  \ Mini, my next stop. I was sitting right in front of the bus, the forest and the\
  \ road were running in front my eyes. An old argetinian man asked my where I was\
  \ headed. Once I answered to him, he stareted talking about an ancient mines in\
  \ the deepness of the first, he called them \u201CMinas de Wanda\u201D. First I\
  \ was attracted by the story of this hidden place, out of the most traced tourist\
  \ path, so I decided to stopped by even knowing so little about it. Once I arrived\
  \ at the stop I realized that the entrance of the mines was inside the forest and\
  \ I had to across that alone with my big backpacks and all the others stuff that\
  \ I was bringing with me. The bus stop was right next to the main road and there\
  \ was a little house where some came out and stared asking me if I need some help.\
  \ They said to me that the forest was really dangerous,because of the indigenous\
  \ people that we here living in the village, in the heart of the forest. So they\
  \ advised me to take a cab, more safe than walking alone in the lest. First I was\
  \ a fraud but than some kind of sixth sense said to me that the right thing was\
  \ walking through the forest, that probably the taxi could be a \u201Ctourist-trap\u201D\
  . So I started walking in the direction of the forest, even if the people next to\
  \ the bus-stop started shouting to me saying I was in danger, but I didn\u2019t\
  \ care about them."
