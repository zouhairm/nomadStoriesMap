Text: "When I walked out of the airport, the first sunrays of a bright new day touched\
  \ my face. It was a warm welcome after having traveled all night to get to my new\
  \ destination. When I entered Mexico just a few weeks earlier, I haven\u2019t heard\
  \ about the town I was about to get to know. However, when I got invited to volunteer\
  \ at a farmers market and help prepare and sell organic, local, plant-based food,\
  \ I did not hesitate to go and explore a new place. Now I was standing right outside\
  \ the Ixtapa/Zihuatanejo airport and was waiting to get on a colectivo \u2013 the\
  \ name of the public busses in Mexico \u2013 to get to my host.\nWhen I entered\
  \ my temporary home, Patti welcomed me with her hospitality and kindness. She showed\
  \ me her house and my new room, we talked about our lives and previous adventures,\
  \ and she raved about all the things I could do while being here. Even though I\
  \ received a schedule, Patti made sure I had enough time to explore the area.\n\
  Already on the next day I joined her on her weekly trip to the Eco Tiangius Sanka\
  \ farmers market which takes place every Saturday. The location was beautiful: the\
  \ square was built right around a big tree and all the vendors arranged their wooden\
  \ tables next to it. Colorful cloths were put up to provide shade and they formed\
  \ a rainbow around the whole market. Helping out did not just give me a unique travel\
  \ experience, it also made me feel almost like a real local. I met many people with\
  \ whom I could practice my Spanish and learn from. Zihuatanejo is a town with a\
  \ blooming community that cares about local, organic, and environmentally-friendly\
  \ produce. For example, no plastic cutlery or bags were used at the market, and\
  \ people had to either bring their own reusable dishes or the vendors offered banana\
  \ leaves as plates. I loved this idea.\nFurthermore, Zihuatanejo has not just a\
  \ local market. During my free time I explored the different beaches Playa Principal,\
  \ Playa la Ropa, and Playa la Madera. They are amazing places to cool off on a hot\
  \ day and watch the sun set while turning the sky pink. On another day, I also went\
  \ to a local Temazcal which is a type of sweat lodge with a long history in Mesoamerica.\
  \ The bath is supposed to purify the body, mind, and spirit.\nThroughout my stay\
  \ in Zihuatanejo, I helped out at a local market, made friends, and explored stunning\
  \ locations. I would not have expected that beforehand, but yes! It is possible\
  \ to travel, volunteer, explore, and get to know new places and people all at once."
