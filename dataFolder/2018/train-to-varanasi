Text: "It\u2019s almost 4 p.m. and the road is still winding, steep and narrow, typical\
  \ of the Himalayan landscape. After few days spent in a buddhist monastery, our\
  \ jeep is struggling through the bends as we are finally racing down the mountains.\
  \ We must reach the city before 5, the departure time of the last train to Varanasi.\
  \ The second car with the rest of the group and our backpacks apparently has stopped\
  \ somewhere and we haven\u2019t seen them for a while. In the rear-view mirror only\
  \ dust can be seen and no city on the horizon. We are starting to get really nervous.\n\
  \nThe silence that fills the car is as dense as the drivers burning incense in response\
  \ to our stress. We finally reach the station with two minutes until five. The race\
  \ against the time begins, hoping that the train would be a little late. While the\
  \ last passengers are boarding, we try to convince the conductor to wait just a\
  \ few minutes more but our friends never show up. No alternatives are left for our\
  \ indecisiveness. One foot inside and the other still outside of the train, expecting\
  \ a miracle, we finally get in : a loud whistle is heard and the train starts moving.\
  \ \n\nIt is in this moment we see them. They are running down the stairs, each of\
  \ them are carrying two enormous backpacks. A mixture of extreme effort, fear and\
  \ determination can be read in their faces. The hall seems infinite and the train\
  \ is already gaining velocity. We can\u2019t help from screaming. \xAB Emergency\
  \ brake ! \xBB, I hear Matt shouting to me from outside the window. He keeps chasing\
  \ the train and trying to get in, sweating and gasping. I immediately see the red\
  \ lever in front of me. As I stare at it so intensely, all fear is gone and a sensation\
  \ of a still calmness pervades me. I am about to pull the brake but a sudden dull\
  \ sound blocks me \u2013 the train is apparently slowing down until it completely\
  \ stops. Our friends get in. They tumble on the ground, all exhausted, still carrying\
  \ the heavy backpacks. We look at each other and burst out laughing, conscious that\
  \ we made it at last. \n\nMy hand was almost touching the brake and a powerful desire\
  \ to stop the train had come over me, even if eventually I didn\u2019t complete\
  \ the action. I can\u2019t help but think of India\u2019s magic, its unlimited energy\
  \ and caos generated by its people. By the end of the journey, we discovered that\
  \ the train conductor saw our friends running and decided to stop, just when I was\
  \ about to pull the brake. Well, sometimes great stories shift into a reverse course."
