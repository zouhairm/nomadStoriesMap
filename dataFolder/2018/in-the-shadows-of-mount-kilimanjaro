Text: "A nondescript orphanage, down an unmarked dirt road outside Moshi, Tanzania,\
  \ Africa. CLICK. SNAP. \u201CRow, row, row your boat, gently down the stream, merrily,\
  \ merrily, merrily, life is but a dream.\u201D The sun is frying an egg on top of\
  \ my head as little brown arms latch on to my neck. We hit the ground with a thud.\
  \ Brown eyes brightly guide the way back up to the slide, again. She starts to sing\
  \ the only English words she knows, \u201Crow, row, row your boat, gently down the\
  \ stream\u2026\u201D Ava is her name. She has on a ragged pink dress with a flower\
  \ pattern, no doubt from one of the many volunteers. She was the first one to run\
  \ up to me that first day, arms outstretched, and she was the only one to stay every\
  \ day after. She was mine and I was hers on the faded blue teeter totter, the swing,\
  \ and the rusty green merry go round. At the end of the day I\u2019d leave the sandal\
  \ pattern of the dirt and red clay mix on my feet just to smile. \nCLICK. SNAP.\
  \ I stare out into the never-ending hazy heat, the glare adjusting my eyes for me.\
  \ I\u2019ve never seen anything like it. A smattering of dilapidated houses, graffiti\
  \ written, broken, and falling apart; the carcasses of animals hanging from their\
  \ feet, mouths gaping open grazing the porch floor, a mesh of white and red, meat\
  \ and veins.  The carcasses bake as I do, our own internal ovens. CLICK. SNAP. A\
  \ boy, around seven carries a baby, no more than nine months on his back. The baby\
  \ nestles tightly into his back amongst the bold bright reds, white, and black flower\
  \ patterned kanga. Their coal eyes holding me, a gravitational pull.\nCLICK. SNAP.\
  \ I sit on a rickety yellow bench staring at shelves and shelves of paper-weathered,\
  \ tattered. If I could reach out and touch them they would fall like a hand full\
  \ of glitter thrown up in the air. I pee into a glass thimble standing over a drain.\
  \ My sandals like sponges lap up whatever other liquids were left behind on the\
  \ concrete stained floor. My stomach an angry toddler kicking and punching endlessly.\
  \ I wait on the yellow bench as beads of sweat pool in my armpits, my neck, behind\
  \ my knees. I hear the doctor like an echo say, \u201CYou fine. No malaria. Hakuna\
  \ matata.\u201D CLICK. SNAP. As I look out at the vast Arizona desert. Africa calls.\
  \ She comes in, a sudden flash. I am there again. It doesn\u2019t matter where I\
  \ am. Honduras. California. New Mexico. Anywhere. She is there calling me back and\
  \ that is the last thing I expected."
