Text: "There is a tribe that travels daily by train.  They live online and connected\
  \ to the hypnotic Excell worksheets to reach their commercial objectives, thus obviating\
  \ other dimensions of their life; at least at that moment, at least on that train.\
  \ At that moment, in that train, the tribe lives a life based on the probabilistic\
  \ science of performance calculations, without knowing, or without wanting to calculate\
  \ the hours, the days, the years ... the time of their lives they dedicate to those\
  \ calculations with expiration date. From Monday to Friday, focusing their efforts\
  \ and energies on commercial and professional success; by the time the exiguous\
  \ weekend comes they feel tired and with the enormous task of reestablishing their\
  \ vital life.I belonged to that group a long time ago, I was one of them, me; that\
  \ is why I have developed this ineffective capacity to identify those of my own\
  \ species. Now I do not belong to that world anymore. Not now. No longer. There\
  \ is a singular building at the entrance of Madrid. Its uniqueness lies in its ugliness.\
  \ It is a horrendous grey building with green doors, built right next to another\
  \ one even more horrendous and greyer.  Together they form a strange couple. They\
  \ are two buildings. Different entities, built together and invisible to the eyes\
  \ that lost the ability to look and admire. There is no time for anything else.\
  \ You cannot look or think of other things. Well, in that amalgam of grey concrete,\
  \ small windows and green doors, there is a balcony covered entirely with flowers.\
  \ . Sometimes life appears in the most unexpected places. Life always takes life\u2019\
  s side. The owner, has preferred to look at a dense wall of flowers and green leaves\
  \ to the grey and sad view of the train tracks that transport people as grey and\
  \ sad as those roads that he prefers not to look at. There is another balcony which\
  \ also timidly begins to fill with flowers. Perhaps it is likely that in a few months,\
  \ in a couple of years, the entire building will be hidden by a dense and splendid\
  \ layer of leaves and flowers that covers the entire building. Maybe they have a\
  \ chance to be something else and stop being a grey concrete building. Perhaps,\
  \ it is probable that some traveller will stop thinking for a moment about his laborious\
  \ and thorough Excell worksheets and can admire a different landscape. I hope so."
