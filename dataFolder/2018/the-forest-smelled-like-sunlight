Text: "\u201CTwo roads diverged in a yellow wood, And sorry I could not travel both\u201D\
  \ \nThe words I learnt by heart in sixth grade flashed through my mind as I stood\
  \ by the eerie temple in the envelope of green anticipating the right way.  It had\
  \ been an hour since I started walking. Tired and restless, I wanted to give up\
  \ but the fear of getting lost was empowered by my desire to know what lies ahead.\
  \ I was halfway through the route to Tada falls situated at the border of two vibrant\
  \ southern states of India \u2013 Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu.  \nThe bridge was\
  \ the starting point that seemed like a connection between the wild and the tamed.\n\
  I started walking into the wild of Andhra Pradesh. Each step further up into the\
  \ citadels of this woodland felt like forever. The iridescent wings of a swarm of\
  \ butterflies pirouetted in flight as I walked past them to reach that eerie temple.\
  \ \nTwo roads diverged in a wood and I did not know which one to take. So, I followed\
  \ my instincts and chose one. As I walked through the moss-veiled trail, one step\
  \ at a time, there were more colossal boulders. My legs had started to hurt by then.\
  \ With drenched shoes, I walked over the huge roots of the trees spread-eagled on\
  \ the rustling foliage. \n \u201CThe path from here is very tough\u201D said the\
  \ forest guard. But the sound of the waterfall bouncing off the rocks was irresistible.\
  \ \nI kept looking at the dancing leaves in the restless wind until I heard some\
  \ unfriendly howls. A barrel of monkeys looked down upon me as I crunched the last\
  \ wafer in my mouth. I thought it would be wise to throw away the remaining snacks\
  \ to distract them. Just like I thought, the monkeys were as quick as greased lightning\
  \ in grabbing the packets. Dodging a few monkeys, I slowly slid past my way up to\
  \ a safe area. The trek was definitely not more fun than a barrel of monkeys. \n\
  Although, I was exhausted, I still enjoyed my way back to the tamed world. I walked\
  \ along the wooded path breathing with the trees and touching their trunks. I felt\
  \ proud. I knew I was in my element, as I walked away from the huge boulders and\
  \ the tough trails into a wild expanse of moorland. The feeling of accomplishment\
  \ took over me as I walked faster with the joys of spring I had in my heart.\nI\
  \ saw a twig fall down on the green carpet of leaves and it was a beautiful sight.\
  \ I picked it up and it was almost like a perfumed handkerchief, filled with that\
  \ earthly fragrance. I breathed again and again. That day, the forest smelled like\
  \ sunlight."
