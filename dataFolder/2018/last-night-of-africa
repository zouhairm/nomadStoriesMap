Text: "\"Are we going?\" asks Alma, first beating one foot and then the other on the\
  \ ground, as if to circulate more blood in the numbed muscles.\n\"Let\u2019s go,\"\
  \ I answer, and she starts walking in the dark.\nI follow her, lengthening my steps,\
  \ so as not to lose her in the darkness. We reach one of the areas I have never\
  \ visited before: it is a small group of buildings arranged in a horseshoe, painted\
  \ with a faded peeled yellow.\nIt 's hard to move quickly on the ground disseminated\
  \ by potholes and rocks. At every step I feel a new handful of pebbles and sand\
  \ getting into my shoes and my breath gets shorter and shorter.\nI sigh with relief\
  \ when, coming under the small concrete portico, I see familiar faces from the windows.\
  \ From inside we can hear some little screams and the crawling of the flip-flops\
  \ moving towards us. A small group of girls come out and run towards us, some of\
  \ them smiling and calling us by name, some a bit apart, two by two, their bodies\
  \ tensed and attentive.\nThey are all students of the Nyabula school, the village\
  \ in the Tanzanian hinterland where we are housed.\nAlmost all of them wear the\
  \ uniform with the national colors, the green, yellow, red and blue of the flag,\
  \ arranged in horizontal stripes.\nTheir clothing is simple, I think many of them\
  \ do not have a spare uniform: I had noticed it looking at them in class, or in\
  \ the dirty field in front of the school, at pudding time.\nSome have slippers,\
  \ some shoes, some nothing.\nAlma and I are incorporated into the vortex of voices,\
  \ skirts, ebony skin and questions.\nI feel a hand slipping into mine and squeezing\
  \ it hard: turning to look for the owner, I immediately meet a pair of black and\
  \ deep eyes that I had already known.\nIt\u2019s Halima, a quiet and mysterious\
  \ girl who appears and disappears like a shadow.\nA few days ago, we talked about\
  \ religion on the edge of the soccer field: hers is a family of animists, her grandmother\
  \ explained to her how God is a being present in everything, because everything\
  \ is part of him. She has both fear and respect and often she sits on the ground\
  \ and prays. The most curious memory I have about her is when she asked me to tell\
  \ her what the snow feels like...\nMeeting Alma\u2019s look I understand that it\
  \ is getting late.\nThis is our last African night, tomorrow a long journey to the\
  \ coast awaits us.\nAlma and I reluctantly say farewell to all the girls in the\
  \ dorm: it\u2019s time for goodbyes. \nAnother dive into a sea of embraces and ebony\
  \ kisses and we go out again into the pungent air of the night."
