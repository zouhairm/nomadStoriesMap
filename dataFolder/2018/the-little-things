Text: "Sunday. Lying in a hammock in the warm shade. Cradling a baby rabbit on my\
  \ chest with one hand. My other hand dripping with the syrupy sweet juice of a just\
  \ picked nispero fruit. My belly full of \u201Csopa\u201D. Pure contentment. \n\n\
  How did I reach contentment? Lisseth.\n\nLisseth works in administration at a hotel\
  \ where I am volunteering in Nicaragua. She is a hard-working single-mom who spends\
  \ her one day off a week studying English and drives an hour to see her eleven-year-old\
  \ son, Denis, two nights a week. The rest of the time he is cared for by family.\
  \ In much of Nicaragua, family is life. \n\n\u201CYou can come to my English class!\u201D\
  \ Lisseth stated enthusiastically. \u201CSure!\u201D I responded with the (somewhat\
  \ American) assumption that it probably wouldn\u2019t happen. But it did, because\
  \ Lisseth means what she says and usually gets what she wants.\n\nThat is how I\
  \ came to arrive on the back of a motorcycle with three others on Sunday morning.\
  \ The bumpy dirt lane is all potholes and horse-carts, locals throwing water on\
  \ the road to keep dust from kicking up and into lungs. Passing fields of impossibly\
  \ green grasses and sugar cane in the tropical, not yet too hot sun.\n\nAt her school,\
  \ I stand in front of her English class awkwardly answering personal questions.\
  \ The students ask me to speak in Spanish and unabashedly chuckle when I do. Each\
  \ student stands in front of the class introducing themselves, most expressing their\
  \ hope that speaking English will give them more opportunities, able to speak in\
  \ complete memorized sentences after only a few classes. They have been diligent.\n\
  \nWe then cruise to Lisseth\u2019s house where her mother, Rosa, has been cooking\
  \ soup in a large caldron outside over a fire for four hours. Cats, dogs, and chickens\
  \ stroll freely. Neighbor Don Julio wanders in and out of the home as family and\
  \ joins us for lunch. Rosa serves us generous portions of soup, all the animals\
  \ and vegetables it contains harvested from the neighborhood. \n\nPost-soup, Lisseth\
  \ ushers me to the hammock in the bar-lined patio. Before I can finish my nispero,\
  \ Denis brings me a \u201Cchoco banano\u201D, a frozen chocolate-covered banana\
  \ that is a favorite local treat. Lisseth appears with a bag for me full of soup\
  \ to-go, coconuts and plantains that she harvested moments ago. All urge me to take\
  \ a siesta, but I want to savor this moment of feeling generously cared for by near\
  \ strangers who have all that is important."
