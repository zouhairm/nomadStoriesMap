Text: "For me, traveling is a way to see this vast world. That's what spurred me to\
  \ keep traveling from one place to another. That's why my friend and I traveled\
  \ from Jakarta, Indonesia to Singapore and Malaysia. It\u2019s reckless from the\
  \ economic side. We departed from Jakarta with potluck equipments, but had enough\
  \ knowledge about the destinations. We bought tickets destinations to Kuala Lumpur,\
  \ Malaysia with a duration of transit of 23 hours in singapore. Those 23 hours we\
  \ used to travel many beautiful places in Singapore. Drove around using the subway,\
  \ and walked to all places. Tired? definitely. The hotel was not our priority there.\
  \ We slept at the airport. The Singapore airport was very good. Our journey continued\
  \ to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The cheapest hotel we found on the internet was the\
  \ best choice for us. The 2x3 meter hotel became the most comfortable place at that\
  \ time. We were aware that our financial condition was very limited, but our hearts\
  \ and feet didn\u2019t want to just stop in Kuala Lumpur, so we continued our journey\
  \ to Penang, Malaysia. Penang is an ancient and historic place in Malaysia. So many\
  \ historical places we can visit such as Sri Mahamariamman Temple, Penang Street\
  \ Art, Penang State Museum, those places became the places we visited. Our return\
  \ was not easy. The tickets we ordered from Penang to Kuala Lumpur and Kuala Lumpur\
  \ to Jakarta were purchased separately. Foolishness happened. I was too fascinated\
  \ by the scenery in penang, made me bought wrong tickets, the mistake must be paid\
  \ for 2 million rupiah or 160 US dollars. Panic happened, confused, restless, and\
  \ regrets stirred up my feelings. But fast action was needed, so I couldn\u2019\
  t help that from happening. After 1 week away from comfortable home, travelled around\
  \ 2 countries with limited money and faced many problems, the trip seemed did not\
  \ take 5 hours from Penang to Jakarta, it was like only 5 minutes. But in those\
  \ 5 minutes I'm grateful, I'm capable of being a brave man, being a human being\
  \ who is willing to try new things, and daring to get out of his comfort zone. Many\
  \ of my friends questioned my courage, asked about my goals. From many questions\
  \ that they asked, I realized one thing, it\u2019s that they don\u2019t want to\
  \ try and they are afraid of something new. They are not aware that in this life,\
  \ travel and movement will continue to occur from one place to another without being\
  \ inhibited, therefore the only thing we can do is prepare ourselves for the upcoming\
  \ changes."
