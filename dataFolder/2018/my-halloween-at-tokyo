Text: "I had planned to go to Tokyo for a few months now. The Ed Sheeran concert I\
  \ was going to will be held there. I was so excited. Like that kid receiving an\
  \ Avocado for Christmas in that one video. I loved Japan! I grew up watching Anime\
  \ and the first time I came for a school workshop it was wonderful! Now that Ed\
  \ Sheeran was coming it would've been perfect. I waited almost a year since I got\
  \ the tickets and a LIFETIME to see Ed Sheeran, THE ED SHEERAN, live in the flesh.\
  \ Too bad I didn't get to. \n So two weeks before the concert, I find out it's cancelled\
  \ since Ed Sheeran broke BOTH his arms in a car accident. \nSo here I was, prepared\
  \ to settle for Disneyland and the great food. Until one Tuesday evening, I scrolled\
  \ through my Facebook and came across something that would make up everything. A\
  \ company called Mari Car allowed people to speed through the streets of Tokyo in\
  \ go karts and wearing onesies! For the first time since I found out that Ed broke\
  \ his arms and the concert was cancelled, I was ecstatic. \nOn Halloween day, at\
  \ around 5 o'clock, my brother and I made our way to Mari Car. The small, one-storey\
  \ building with a dozen or so karts parked in front wasn't easy to find, it was\
  \ in between two bigger buildings, hidden from plain sight. The first thing I saw\
  \ when I arrived were dozens of onesies hung from the walls of the six by six room.I\
  \ automatically take the pinkest costume there (I was a dinosaur, tail and all).\
  \ After our instructor explained everything we needed to know about our karts, we\
  \ were good to go. I hit the gas as soon as we were given the GO signal and it was\
  \ spectacularly breathtaking! I sped through the Rainbow Bridge, admiring all the\
  \ colors hitting my retinas and enjoying the cold air violently hitting my face.\
  \ Not only was this my first time driving in Tokyo, but it was also my first time\
  \ karting (talk about hitting two birds with one stone!). We drove past the Tokyo\
  \ tower to Ginza, taking a short break in between. For me the best one was Shibuya\
  \ crossing. There was this huge Halloween event and it was filled with people, all\
  \ dressed in costumes. The moment they saw us drive past, they would wave and take\
  \ pictures. I saw someone that looked like Spiderman! I felt the electricity of\
  \ the city in my bones and the adrenaline pump in my blood. Not only did I get to\
  \ see the attractions, but I also saw the beautiful lights of the mega city I was\
  \ in. Karting around Tokyo was the best Halloween ever and I wouldn't have had it\
  \ any other way."
