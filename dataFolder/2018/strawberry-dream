Text: "I closed the door of my family house in Madrid on a warm May morning where\
  \ it starts my adventure toward the strawberry harvest. It took me two weeks of\
  \ travelling where I did few stops on the way before end up in Sams\xF8 island,\
  \ Denmark. \nI left the land in Kalundborg to go in the ferry that would drive me\
  \ to the island of strawberries fields, where I'd spend the next two months. On\
  \ the way, I saw the drops of rain falling in the North sea. There are feelings\
  \ that are of a holy importance. Flashes of a shinny green of Slovenia were mixed\
  \ up in my mind with the breathtaking high of Tatra mountains.\nSuddenly, a characteristic\
  \ sound of ship remembered me that I was landing in Sams\xF8, an island located\
  \ at about ten kilometers from the East coast of the Jutland in the bay of Kattegat.\
  \ An unexpected paradise under my feets where I could bike through corn and barley\
  \ fields and shed my tears in the golden sunset light falling on a virgin seaside.\n\
  I joined to the team, made up by tens of pickers, that were settled in the farm,\
  \ a place where we were living as in a community. People were coming from different\
  \ backgrounds: from a bunch of students to chilean couple who left everything to\
  \ look for adventures, passing through many other random travellers from everywhere.\
  \ Hundreds of hands ready to pick strawberries. \nThis multicultural environment\
  \ found everyday a height in the kitchen area, not only to taste unpredictable meals\
  \ but the encounters and time for creativity (music, crafts, games...) and shared\
  \ naps had place over there. \nWith different references and experiences we'd discover\
  \ magic of simple life, sharing our knowledge from a midnight deep talk that could\
  \ maybe save the planet to the appropriate manner to prepare coffee.\nNothing aspires\
  \ more humanity than working in nature, this simple way to be was as a revelation\
  \ to me in a morning that I got lost my sight on the length of fields. I was picking\
  \ berries on my knees, since these plants are low size, and raised my head time\
  \ to time to contemplate the eclectic phenomenon of the harvest. I could find enthusiastics\
  \ bulgarian songs on air, smiles of complicity between fast pickers that were emptying\
  \ them boxes, cigarette break talks about motley topics and birds singing around.\
  \ \nWhat a sunny day that could evolve in chain of gray clouds about our heads and\
  \ rain without mercy. Wet and blessed, we laughed and screamed loudly dancing together,\
  \ as a chain of hearts without borders in an oniric danish summer."
