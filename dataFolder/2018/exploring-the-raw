Text: I knew the minute I landed in Thailand that I was going to be lost. not speaking
  the language, not knowing what direction to go. Having an overwhelming feeling of
  excitement and exploration took over every emotion. The air was heavy and everything
  was fast everyone seemed to be in a rush, that's what it felt those 5 days in Bangkok.
  Until I got down to the island of koh lanta. I picked this island for it being a
  freedom Island, I wanted to connect with nature and be away from all the tourist
  attraction and party scene. I landed at night the island was very dark since it
  has very little electricity, when I awoke and open my eyes just to see pure Paradise.
  the ocean waves crashed underneath my feet the water was still it look like Crystal
  and the sky told endless stories. as I explore the island I meant beautiful locals,
  that were happy to help, show and explain the culture, the food, and the love for
  nature. I took cooking class and explore the jungle, went fishing for my food, took
  beautiful dancing classes and said a prayer with a floating flower wreath. Mark
  my body with a traditional Bamboo Tattoo, really connected and understood that nature
  gives us all we need. The locals are very humble, strong working and smart individuals
  that live their life by what nature gives them and gives Back To Nature what they
  take. Traveling is an eye opener you take yourself out of your comfort zone, your
  everyday tasks and you explore something new something you probably you didn't think
  you can achieve. You taking in new flavors, new sites, new smell, new feelings.
  Just be warned it just opens up even more your excitement of exploration.
