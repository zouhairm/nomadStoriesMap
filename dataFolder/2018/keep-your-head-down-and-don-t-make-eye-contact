  \ San Francisco, come yeah?\u2019 The phone was silent; the best time to ask for\
  \ anything in life is to wake up the person from a deep sleep and to speak extremely\
  \ quickly. Ten seconds passed and the phone was vibrating with the sounds of confused\
  \ muffling and coughing, of a man who had too many cigarettes and a severe hangover\
  \ from a heavy night out. After another moments pause, the voice on the other end\
  \ finally spoke with the magical words of  \u2018ah\u2026um\u2026 yeah, sure\u2019\
  . These words are what started the Ginger Ninja and the Goth Hippies four -day broke\
  \ ass adventure. Those few words that were spoken nine months earlier were still\
  \ lingering in my mind. We were here! Hardly any spending money and smelling like\
  \ we had been working in a sweatshop with no access to deodorant, we were ready\
  \ to take on the city. Sitting on a semi clean train, with the odd script of graffiti\
  \ tags written on the seats and walls, we were free from the recycled air and the\
  \ many lines we were made to form. The flight from our home Melbourne, Australia\
  \ was 16 hours. We were happy to be in the semi fresh air, and decided because of\
  \ our low funds that the cheapest way for us to arrive at our hostel in the city\
  \ centre was by using the subway. The train arrived at our final stop, a big cement\
  \ rectangle with an array of business suits, rowdy youth and the homeless filled\
  \ our sight; a stale, musty smell; bright lights and sounds travelling from all\
  \ directions, were awakening all of our senses. We climbed up the stairs, with our\
  \ suitcases awkwardly carried in our arms, into the sunshine and hustle and bustle\
  \ of the big \u2018City by the Bay\u2019. The walk to the hostel on Ellis St. was\
  \ twenty minutes\u2026up a big hill\u2026to a street that is in the heart of two\
  \ of the worst neighbourhoods in all of San Francisco (which we didn\u2019t know\
  \ at the time). The further we went up the hill, the dirtier it got, litter shimmering\
  \ over the footpaths. There were lines of the homeless waiting to get into shelters\
  \ for an evening feed and a bed to sleep in, small groups of people arguing about\
  \ small trivial matters and yelling coming from the shadow people in the windows\
  \ to the public below. We did not feel welcomed. This is not what you see on TV.\
  \ For a while the thought that we were travelling the wrong way was repeating itself\
  \ over and over in both of our heads and we stopped to ask a police officer. Two\
  \ more blocks and a left and we would arrive at our destination."
