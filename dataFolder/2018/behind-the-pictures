Text: "\u201CIt looks just like the pictures!\u201D I\u2019ve heard this from countless\
  \ travelers.\n\nI found myself trudging up the side of a mountain, shovel in hand.\
  \ In front of me stood the classic postcard view of Vernazza, one of the five villages\
  \ of Cinque Terre, Italy.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t heard of this place, I\u2019m sure\
  \ you\u2019ve seen pictures of it. Here, clusters of colorful houses tower over\
  \ the sea below. The vineyards and olive groves neatly line the spaces between the\
  \ villages.\n\nI was staying with a friend who happened to be a local guide in the\
  \ area, and he asked me to tag along on another one of his tours. Without even asking\
  \ where we were going, I agreed to go. I figured that we would simply be hiking\
  \ again, just as we had done on the previous two days. Today we were hiking, except\
  \ we were going to an olive grove so that we could help restore the terraces for\
  \ Alessandria, the local keeper of the grove. \n\nDue to heavy rainfall, many terraces\
  \ had washed away. We spent the morning moving around buckets of dirt and finding\
  \ stones in order to restore the walls. This wasn\u2019t quite what I had imagined\
  \ for the day.\n\nThroughout the day, curious hikers in the area stopped to take\
  \ photos of us digging at the earth.\n\n\u201CNo pictures!\u201D Alessandria shouted\
  \ at the onlookers. \n\n\u201CWe aren\u2019t zoo animals,\u201D she told me, \u201C\
  these tourists just want a picture, but they don\u2019t seem to think about anything\
  \ else.\u201D\n\nThe tiny area gets overwhelmed with tourists every year. Vernazza\
  \ has a population of 500, but millions of people visit the region yearly. Quiet\
  \ trails transform into busy pedestrian highways. The panoramic views become packed\
  \ with people.\n\n\u201CI\u2019ve seen some people step over me to get a picture\
  \ and leave as soon as they get the one they want,\u201D Alessandria continued.\n\
  \nWe didn\u2019t look elegant sweating in the afternoon sun, but it was the only\
  \ way the steep cliffs could stay molded into the beautiful vistas everyone expects.\
  \ Every terrace around me was created by someone with a tool in hand. It wasn\u2019\
  t an easy task to shape the land. It needed constant upkeep. \n\nAs we worked, the\
  \ village beneath the hill peaked out from between the trees. Soon, Alessandria\
  \ pulled out a picnic blanket and set out an assortment of food she had prepared.\
  \ Instead of focusing on the vistas, I devoured the moment around me. We were all\
  \ new found friends, cheerfully chatting away on a cliffside olive grove.\n\nI took\
  \ a picture of the classic view from atop the hill. Now when I look at it, countless\
  \ memories flood back."
