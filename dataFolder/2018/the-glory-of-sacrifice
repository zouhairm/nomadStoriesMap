Text: "As I left the bustling city of Bhubaneswar behind, the countryside stretched\
  \ before me like a great quilt of golden, brown and green quadrates. After an hour\
  \ long drive, I reached the city of Konark, the land where the language of stone\
  \ surpasses the language of man. It is quoted so due to the intricate art work on\
  \ stones of the Sun temple, depicting thousands of images of deities, lovers, and\
  \ myriad scenes of courtly life. One can clearly see that time has been harsh on\
  \ this magnificent beauty, yet it stands tall while the sun rays accentuate its\
  \ sharp edges. \nThe cacophony of street vendors and tourists slowly dissipates\
  \ as I enter the temple. The only thing I can focus then is the colossal structure\
  \ which is half in ruins, yet continues to entice us with its charms. A scrawny,\
  \ little kid snaps me out of my thoughts, smiling through his crooked teeth he asks,\
  \ \u201CDo you want to know the story of the chief architect\u2019s son? He was\
  \ the one who finished the construction\u201D. The boy has me intrigued I softly\
  \ nod at him and he begins. He tells me that the chief architect and other constructors\
  \ took nearly 12 years to finish the construction, but failed to place the Kalasa\
  \ on the top of the temple. The chief architect\u2019s son, Dharmapad who had mastered\
  \ the art of Odia temple architecture figured that there was something wrong in\
  \ the plan and assisted them in correcting it. While the workers were happy that\
  \ the construction was finally over, they couldn\u2019t stop thinking about how\
  \ the king would be disappointed in them upon hearing that a boy completed the construction\
  \ while they could not. When the boy came to know about their worries, he climbed\
  \ up the crown of the temple and sacrificed himself into the adjoining sea, to save\
  \ the pride of his father and his fellow workers.  He sacrificed his life to save\
  \ the lives of thousands of constructors and that of his father.\nDharmapad\u2019\
  s sacrifice was not the end for him as his legacy continues to be inherited by all\
  \ the children beyond his village and these children just might be able to indoctrinate\
  \ the world that the true meaning of sacrifice lies in paying a tribute to the heroes\
  \ who justify righteousness in this world. As the glory of sacrifice does not lie\
  \ in the sacrifice itself but in the millions of smiles brought in our faces by\
  \ these brave men."
