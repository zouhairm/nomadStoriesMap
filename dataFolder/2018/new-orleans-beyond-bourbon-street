Text: "For Twelfth Night, the start of carnival, over a thousand historical archaeologists\
  \ were let loose on New Orleans. On the last day of the conference, I took friends\
  \ for a tour of the crescent city beyond Bourbon Street. \n\nWe visit Ronald Lewis,\
  \ who curates a collection of bead and feather costumes in his garage, to learn\
  \ about African-American Mardi Gras traditions. With their roots in a time when\
  \ American Indians helped shield runaway slaves, Indian \"tribes\" gather to battle\
  \ over costume craftsmanship and dance moves. In the second line, members of benevolent\
  \ society clubs formed in the late 1800s strut and jump behind a parade's brass\
  \ band wearing coordinated suits and waving decorated parasols. Rebuilt after Katrina,\
  \ the House of Dance and Feathers also houses cans of water and reminders of the\
  \ devastation to the Ninth Ward. In the same sentence that Lewis tells us where\
  \ we could see Big Chief Goodman of the Flaming Arrows tribe, he reminds us how\
  \ Katrina still impacts the ward as there is not a road out in case of another storm.\
  \ \n\nA bartender at the Carousel Bar, a circus-clad merry-go-round bar, told me\
  \ that the Orange Store, as the Rampart Food Store is popularly known, has the best\
  \ po' boys. Located on the border of the French Quarter and Treme neighborhoods,\
  \ the what some people might call sketchy corner deli with barred windows sells\
  \ sweet and sour pork and delicious, well-stuffed shrimp po'boys.\n\nIt was happy\
  \ hour, so we headed to Molly's on Decatur, where we were lucky to get the window\
  \ seat. The exuberance of the start of Mardi Gras season passed by as parade participants\
  \ in their sequin and gold attire made their way to the start. We moved across the\
  \ street to the wrought iron balcony of BB King's Blues Bar, where we drank pints\
  \ from NOLA Brewing Company, warmed up on gumbo, and watched the parade to celebrate\
  \ St Joan of Arc's birthday and Epiphany walk by.\n\nNext up, Frenchman Street,\
  \ the neighborhood to see live music. We danced to Hyperphlly, a fun energetic female\
  \ duo at Vaso and to Street Legends All Star Band, a vibrant brass band at the Blue\
  \ Nile. In between, we took a jaunt down to St. Claude Avenue to see Big Chief Goodman.\
  \ The Big Chief decked out in the white feathered headdress with elaborate turquoise\
  \ and red bead work led a krewe through the streets to kick off the parade season.\
  \ We didn't see a battle or a second line, but after visiting the museum, it was\
  \ a treat to see how feathers and beads build community."
