Text: "Windows smashed, shards everywhere, all of our belongings gone. My heart drops\
  \ to my stomach as I take in the scene. The black Skoda sedan we had rented a little\
  \ over an hour ago, had been broken into. The back windows were smashed, the back\
  \ seats yanked out of place, and all of our things taken.\n\nIt was a rookie mistake\
  \ to leave our things in the car, we know this. But, we had just arrived at the\
  \ St. Charles Train Station in Marseille, on a sunny spring day, and decided to\
  \ have some lunch in town before continuing our journey. We parked at Avenue Robert\
  \ Schuman, strolled south by the Cath\xE9dral La Major, and headed toward the port.\
  \ We were in such good spirits!\n\nWhen we got back to the car, and realized what\
  \ had happened, we took stock of what we did have on us: I had a small coin purse\
  \ with a few Euros and credit cards, and my iphone; my father had his point-and-shoot\
  \ camera and sunglasses; but, my mom had her purse, with some money, her meds and\
  \ our passports.\n\nBummed but not defeated, we headed to the nearest police station.\
  \ As we waited in traffic, myself on the driver's seat and my mom sitting right\
  \ behind me, we heard a loud \"bam!\" I looked back through the rearview mirror,\
  \ horrified, and saw that two guys in a motorcycle had bumped against the car. The\
  \ guy in the rear, curly haired and hazel eyed, reached-in through the broken window\
  \ and snatched my mother's purse, right from her arms. \n\nI froze, she cried for\
  \ help, my father ran after them. But, alas, they were gone. A kind young woman\
  \ opened her door to us, three strangers on the street, and offered us drinks, a\
  \ telephone, and some information on what to do next. Still, we just wanted to fly\
  \ back home right then and there. Yet a few hours later, in the safety of our hotel\
  \ in the charming coastal town of La Ciotat, we decided to stay.\n\nWe have always\
  \ traveled pretty light, but this was another level of simplicity and frugality.\
  \ We bought a few cheap pieces of clothing, some essentials and two backpacks, and\
  \ with that, we traveled for two weeks. We went to dinners, toured cities, visited\
  \ museums, and had a wonderful time. Most importantly, we traveled with very little\
  \ yet enjoyed every minute. \n\nAfter this trip, as I retold our story, people would\
  \ say: \"I'm sure you won't be traveling again, anytime soon.\"  And, I would reply:\
  \ \"Why not?\" I learned that an unfortunate travel incident is a great learning\
  \ opportunity and, that one bad experience won't quench my love for traveling and\
  \ exploring... even in Marseille."
