Text: "I had always been a coward. Well, my friends wouldn't call me a coward, but\
  \ I would. I was adventurous, but only within reason. I took chances, but only when\
  \ the odds were in my favor. I played it safe...that is, until I met her. The story\
  \ of how I met my wife will have to wait for another time, this is about our trip\
  \ to Kauai. We left on a sunny Las Vegas afternoon in November, 2016 and arrived\
  \ on what appeared to be the rainiest day of the year. I had rented the cutest little\
  \ hut in the middle of the jungle and had planned to spend the 10 days we were there\
  \ lounging around eating dragonfruit or whatever grew in those jungles. Bronwen,\
  \ my bride, had other plans. Before I could say \"A\u02BBole iki!\" ('no way!' in\
  \ Hawaiian), we were off in our little rented Toyota to the far side of the island.\
  \ I didn't know it at the time, but I was in for the ride of my life. \n\nWe arrived\
  \ at the end of a long road at about 9:15am and we got everything ready, (it's important\
  \ to note that my wife was 4 months pregnant and I carried a 5 month old baby in\
  \ a backpack like an Indian prince riding on an elephant). As we began the trek,\
  \ I noticed a strangely daunting uphill climb, and it's also important to note that\
  \ I'm deathly afraid of heights. After only a short while I saw a sign that said,\
  \ Na'Poli Coast Trail\" and I thought to myself, \"hmm, that sounds pretty...\"\n\
  \nAt some point within the first 2 miles I realized that I was embarking on the\
  \ sort of hike you prepare months for. I was not in shape, I was not mentally prepared,\
  \ and I was scared to death. With each clearing along trail, I saw what was (up\
  \ until that moment) the most beautiful sight I had ever seen. With each mile, each\
  \ step, I hiked closer and closer to heaven. 4 miles. 5 miles. I hurt, I hurt so\
  \ bad. 6 miles. 7 miles. With each mile marker I felt the urge to give up. \"I've\
  \ seen everything there is to see!\" I proclaimed to my patient wife. \"You never\
  \ know what you haven't seen yet\", she said in the most poetic voice imaginable.\n\
  \n8 miles. 9 miles.\n\nWe marched on, the sun falling faster and faster in the sky.\
  \ 10 miles. I was completely dead, but I trusted her, and I wanted to be nowhere\
  \ else but by her side. 11 miles. We did it, and we did it with Hollywood-style\
  \ timing. Just as I sat on a felled tree to catch my breath she said, \"Just look\
  \ at what you've done\", and I looked up to see the most beautiful sunset I had\
  \ ever imagined. \n\nIt was just then that I looked down and saw that my wife had\
  \ done it all barefoot..."
