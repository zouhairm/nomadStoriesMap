Text: "The last thing I expected when moving to America on a working visa was that\
  \ I\u2019d get to explore the country inside out. I managed to be one of the lucky\
  \ few that can say they\u2019ve officially visited and explored all 50 states, as\
  \ well as making the closest friends and the most exciting memories along the way.\n\
  \nInitially, my plan was to spend a few months living with a family as an aupair\
  \ \u2013 tending to their children by day and settling into my new neighborhood\
  \ by night. I was so excited to partake in all the traditional American celebrations\
  \ - from huge dinners at Thanksgiving, to dressing up in crazy costumes for Halloween,\
  \ as well as crowding around a TV to watch the superbowl (even though I understood\
  \ none of it!) and tailgating at a sports game. It has always been a dream of mine\
  \ to truly live the 'American dream' so to be able to do so made me happier than\
  \ anyone could ever imagine! I hadn't factored in travelling around too much, as\
  \ my focus was mainly on working and immersing myself into the culture and lifestyle\
  \ that came with living in the United States. \n\nFast forward two years later and\
  \ I was living in a new area, working for a different family who had been the catalysts\
  \ to change my life completely. It's always been crazy to me how one decision can\
  \ alter the path that your life is going so drastically. I was so lucky to have\
  \ the opportunity to travel alongside the job with the help of the amazing family\
  \ I was paired with. Once I had moved, I hit the ground running! Every weekend I'd\
  \ be travelling to new states on the East Coast, cramming as much as I possibly\
  \ could into the 3 days I was there - running off of little sleep and lots of energy\
  \ drinks! Whenever I had a week or longer off, I'd book a flight and travel to the\
  \ opposite end of the country, rent a car and start exploring! I never dreamed I'd\
  \ be able to see the tropical paradise of Hawaii or the wintery heaven of Alaska,\
  \ ride horses on a Texan ranch or stuff my face with deep dish pizza in Chicago.\
  \ I was so lucky I could enjoy one of the best experiences of my life - with the\
  \ fact that it was so unexpected making it even sweeter! \n\nI was so proud the\
  \ moment I arrived in my last destination. Knowing that months of meticulous planning,\
  \ hoarding away savings like a little squirrel and days upon days of booking and\
  \ rebooking things to get the best deal possible \u2013 I had finally done it! It\
  \ had come completely out of the blue but I was so grateful for every opportunity\
  \ I had been able to get!"
