Text: "It\u2019s hard to keep your spirits up when you\u2019re fighting to keeping\
  \ your breakfast down.\nThis was what I learned at 13,000 feet on Mt. Whitney, the\
  \ tallest peak in California and, for me, the start of the John Muir Trail. I was\
  \ three days into a three-week journey through the Sierra Nevadas, leaving behind\
  \ my corporate job to embark on my dream hike, and suddenly my body was in revolt.\n\
  Before California, I would have rated my fitness at no less than an A+. Growing\
  \ up a short drive from the backcountry of Canada\u2019s Banff National Park, I\
  \ was no stranger to the trail. Wanting a challenge, I sought the golden goose:\
  \ 200 miles of pristine alpine, ending at the top of Half Dome in Yosemite. With\
  \ my experience and a handful of training hikes under my belt, I was ready. \nMy\
  \ pack weighing in at a hefty 65 lbs? No problem! Only two short days at altitude\
  \ to acclimatize? No sweat! An overly ambitious itinerary? Bring it on! \nYou\u2019\
  ve probably guessed where this is going: two hours into my trip, the mountain was\
  \ already kicking my ass. The last thing I expected was to hit rock bottom on Day\
  \ Three, but now, on my slow trudge up Whitney, at the start of an eventual ten\
  \ hour day, I\u2019d had enough.\nIn Alberta, the backcountry is stocked with pit\
  \ toilets, which, after a long day on foot, may as well be porcelain thrones. On\
  \ the JMT? No such luck. After digging my required six-inch deep piece of real estate,\
  \ I took yet another trail break, desperately trying to relieve my inner turmoil.\
  \ Again, no such luck.\nThe sun was cresting Whitney, reflecting the deep blue surface\
  \ of Guitar Lake below. I looked east, towards the towering switchbacks ahead. Silently,\
  \ I listed the summits that awaited me. \u201CWhitney. Forester. Glen\u2026\u201D\
  \ This list haunted me, reminding me of the pain to come.\nAs the sun and I continued\
  \ to climb, that list started to change. Maybe it was the way the color of Guitar\
  \ Lake shifted as time passed. Maybe it was the granola bar I forced down. Whatever\
  \ it was, during that climb, the list changed: from challenges to objectives, from\
  \ obstacles to goals. That sadistic list became my mantra.\nWeeks later, sitting\
  \ atop Half Dome and watching the sun rise on my last day, I scanned my memories.\
  \ In amongst a lifetime\u2019s worth of jaw-dropping views, I found one out of place\
  \ moment: an ill-fated nature break on the side of Whitney. In many ways, the low\
  \ point of my hike.\nLooking back, I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. After\
  \ all, once you bottom out, there\u2019s nowhere to go but up."
