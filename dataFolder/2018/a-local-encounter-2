Text: "He wandered the streets at night, searching for a meal to satisfy the pleas\
  \ of his empty stomach. Enticing smells from local restaurants were swept by the\
  \ wind, and carried to him. He lifted his nose to the sky, and enjoyed the sense\
  \ of comfort that the mix of scents brought him.\nHe was a city local; nobody knew\
  \ the lonely streets better than he. He didn\u2019t have a family, and oftentimes\
  \ wandered the streets of his world alone. Occasionally, he\u2019d come across another\
  \ wanderer, like him. Some days they would merely cross paths, and on other days,\
  \ they would travel together. He had no preference, however, for he knew that any\
  \ partner he found would only be a temporary companion. \nPeople oftentimes walked\
  \ by him with inviting plates of food in hand, and he would want nothing more than\
  \ to have a nibble. He didn\u2019t care for their money, or their pity. All he wanted\
  \ was a satisfying taste of a meal, no matter how small the portion.\nOne night,\
  \ he wandered by a restaurant that was open later than the rest. Clusters of people\
  \ lined the outdoor patio with drinks in hand, their voices competing with one another,\
  \ and the music that boomed from inside.\nAs he approached the patio, people paid\
  \ little attention to him. He cautiously made his way up the steps and claimed a\
  \ patch of the patio to lay himself down. His eyes shifted from one group to the\
  \ next, looking for any care in their eyes. He found none.\nAfter a while of sitting\
  \ around, he decided it was time to approach someone. Maybe they could offer him\
  \ some food, or company. It was getting late, and people had been drinking for a\
  \ while now. Tonight, he craved some interaction. He scanned the patio once again,\
  \ and his eyes landed on a girl. She was tall, leaned up against the railing with\
  \ a phone resting in her palm. A guy was talking to her, but she didn\u2019t seem\
  \ to care much for his slurred words. This was his chance. He slowly left his resting\
  \ space and approached her. \nHe looked up at me, and our eyes met. His fur was\
  \ ruffled, with patches of bunched-up hairs throughout his frame. I reached my hand\
  \ out to pat his head, and smiled when he delighted at the contact. I\u2019d only\
  \ been in the area for a few weeks and was eager to make local friends. The crowd\
  \ at the bar seemed to have drunk a little too much for a Wednesday, and I couldn\u2019\
  t hold a conversation with anyone. I looked down at the brown eyes that stared back\
  \ at me, and I couldn\u2019t help but laugh. There I was, connecting with a true\
  \ local, a citizen of the streets."
