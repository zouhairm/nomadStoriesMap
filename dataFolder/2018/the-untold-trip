  a perfect plan but we decide to go biking riding there and after that we would wonder

  they were damn serious.we lied to my mom that we were going for wedding of my  friends
  sister.my mom believed it and she permitted me to go,we all were happy and the trip
  begin ,we were very enthusiastic and charged and happy like free birds .We crossed
  panvel and then started for ali bagh through mumbai-goa highway.The weather was
  warm and cold breezes were coming from the south.It was a straight drive for 55
  km and after that we reached pazzri,were Bobby's friends was waiting for us.we met
  him and began with our feather journey .We soon reached alibagh but bobbys friends

  of us there .So before that we went for boozing.we grabed some chilled beer and
  set off to the coasts of nagav,it was dark there .We enjoyed there,we were singing
