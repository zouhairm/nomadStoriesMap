Text: "As I walked along a deserted road I witnessed the dry vast landscape transform\
  \ as I ascended into the mountain. It was late summer and most of the vegetation\
  \ had dried up, the air was crisp and the light and shadows cast from the passing\
  \ clouds constantly changed the appearance of the scenery. As I kept walking along\
  \ the empty road a majestic looking dog came out of no where and started to accompany\
  \ me, its coat of fur weathered by the elements blended with the colours of the\
  \ mountain. At this time of year the mountains had a greyish brown colour and were\
  \ bare of vegetation. I wasn\u2019t sure whether the dog had an owner, but it wanted\
  \ to keep me company. The dog knew all the different paths of the mountain, sometimes\
  \ it would run further up the mountain or disappear down a ravine. If I ever decided\
  \ to veer away from the path, the dog would always lead me back in the right direction.\
  \ At this moment I had a feeling as if the mountain had provided me with a guardian.\
  \ I had recently lost my dog of 17 years, and felt comfort in my new companion.\
  \ This experience of walking aimlessly along a winding road into the mountain gave\
  \ me profound sensation of peace and freedom that I hadn\u2019t felt in a long time,\
  \ I finally started to process where I was in the world and what had happened over\
  \ the past few weeks travelling through Asia and Iran. I had witnessed the bombing\
  \ in Bangkok and soon after travelled to a country that has been shut off to the\
  \ world since the Islamic revolution in 1979, I had met people having to repress\
  \ their identities and sexuality in fear of persecution, I had been hosted by the\
  \ hospitable family imaginable who had been split apart and forced abroad after\
  \ the government wanted to incarcerate their children for the crime of protesting\
  \ and singing in a pop music video. I became friends with an asylum seeker who got\
  \ deported from Australia, lived on top of a life saving hut in Bondi beach and\
  \ was now living with mental health problems with the government breathing down\
  \ his back. I even met an old man on top of a mountain in Shiraz who lived in a\
  \ cave for 6 years writing poetry and philosophy, he could speak 6 languages, travelled\
  \ the world and had the most incredible insights about the world. I realised how\
  \ I was a world away from friends and family back in Australia. I was alone walking\
  \ through an ancient mountain range with a stray dog in the Alborz mountains in\
  \ the Islamic Republic of Iran. It was surreal, and perfect."
