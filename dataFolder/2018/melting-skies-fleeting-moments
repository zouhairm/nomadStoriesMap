Text: "I see myself reflected in fleeting smiles. The squint, grin, gaze, smile, grimace\
  \ and exhale. More and more I find information from these interactions. To build\
  \ a connection, to form a friendship unique to these fleeting moments. That is true\
  \ fulfilment. \n\nThe best resturant, Donsai station. A beautiful woman with a kind\
  \ giving in her eyes, something that floats out of them and finds sweetness in everything.\
  \ As the world turns to water her green curry provides shelter. Sharing her sisters\
  \ coconut sweets, cooked in banana leaf, sipping clear lemongrass tea and conveying\
  \ awe over this melting melting sky. \n\nHair that gives him a bouncing height.\
  \ Bob Marley tee and a smile so wide I can't remember much else. A hired bicycle\
  \ that fulfilled curiosities. Riding barefoot at night, a bunch of bananas hanging\
  \ from the handlebar. And following the beaches call, I turned my head to the fuel\
  \ station door and threw a wave over my shoulder... a smile arching high as he called\
  \ out a morning greeting. \n\nOde, his eyes searching for every direction. Living\
  \ on a floating home. The glass waters a clear view into the genuineness of his\
  \ soul fabric. He sat opposite me with a kindness in his fingertips. Gifting me\
  \ a homemade dinner and the gentle smile of a grandparent. Later that night, as\
  \ the laughter pulled me to my feet. He watched as I pranced with his tipsy Thai\
  \ co workers, and flowed a warmth of kinship as I took my seat once more beside\
  \ him. \n\nTwo older train goers. With a perfect ring of ice blue his eyes flashed\
  \ directly opposite mine. And she leant back against the metal of the train walls,\
  \ comfortably resting her barefoot on the edge of my chair. So caring with their\
  \ close observation. Ensuring we were comfortable, that the water bottle didn't\
  \ roll down the shaking isle, that my blanket dare not sweep the dusty carriage\
  \ floor. They whispered wakefulness into my tired eyes, and as we took their advice\
  \ to depart the train at this stop, I looked back into their well wishes. \n\nBoys\
  \ dancing in play fights down alleys, an woman offering me a puppy, fisherman gasping\
  \ at the cold around their ankles and then laughing with my swimming heart, families\
  \ dining, a teenager plucking her eyebrows on the back see of a moped, a man pulling\
  \ over to tell me where to buy coffee, a mother giving me a ride on her bike...\
  \ \n\nThese people, these moments are so giving in the simplicity of there being.\
  \ These connections  are entwined within the deepest gratitudes I hold."
