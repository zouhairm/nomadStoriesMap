Text: "\u201CWe have to go out there! I didn\u2019t come all this way not to!\u201D\
  \ I stared out of squinted eyes into the orange sea of Erg Chebbi sand dunes. It\
  \ looked like fog that swirled through the air and engulfed them, but it was sand.\
  \ I put my sunglasses on, even though the sun was nowhere to be seen. The lenses\
  \ didn\u2019t prevent the sand from stinging my eyes, and the tint made the visibility\
  \ even poorer. \n     I entered the settlement camp where the rest of the group\
  \ waited. \u201CIt\u2019s not letting up, but we can still go if everyone agrees.\u201D\
  \ the guide said. \u201CIt\u2019s a long journey to the desert camp, and if this\
  \ continues we could be stuck in it all night.\u201D Some wanted to brave it, others\
  \ were reluctant. In the end we all knew the only decision. We had each traveled\
  \ afar from different parts of the world to the edge of the Sahara, and this trek\
  \ to camp in the desert was one of the main reasons we had come to Morocco. \n \
  \    With Berber scarves wrapped around our heads, we approached the camels. A particularly\
  \ strong gust of wind blew. \u201COuch! How can they stand it?\u201D The billowing\
  \ sand stung like swarms of tiny wasps, but it didn\u2019t seem to affect them at\
  \ all. I mounted my camel, Mustafa, and when he rose I held on for dear life, gripping\
  \ the handle with anxiety and fear. \n     The camels walked treacherously close\
  \ to the edge of the steep dunes, some as high as a hundred meters. One false step\
  \ and an impromptu side trip down a dune was imminent. \n     As the winds intensified,\
  \ it became almost impossible to keep my eyes open. Talking was pointless as well.\
  \ It was too loud for anyone to hear. \n     We reached a steep bank too risky for\
  \ the caravan to cross. The guides tried to push away sand to level it, but it was\
  \ no use. We had to detour and go around. \n     Breathing became increasingly difficult\
  \ with every passing moment. The sand burned my nose and mouth with every breath.\
  \ The saddle was without stirrups, making it hard to balance against the gusts.\
  \ My legs cramped and soon became numb. Unable to see, hear, breathe, or feel, the\
  \ storm had completely incapacitated me. \n     Suddenly, the camp appeared. My\
  \ legs almost buckled as I dismounted Mustafa, and I stumbled into a tent. The winds\
  \ soon subsided and the storm passed. Overcoming the arduous journey rewarded us\
  \ with an unforgettable night of tasty tagine, wonderful wine, lots of laughter,\
  \ Moroccan music, slumber under the stars, and waking up to the most spectacular\
  \ sunrise over the great dunes we had just conquered."
