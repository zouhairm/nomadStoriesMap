Text: "This story happened to me in Myanmar, in a small town, one among hundreds of\
  \ other towns in the country. That day my friends and me decided to visit a tofu\
  \ factory located just around the corner as we were said. It took us no time to\
  \ hire old bikes, the ones that groan at every turn of the wheel, you know, and\
  \ seem to go to pieces right away.  The nice lady who owned the bikes drew on a\
  \ piece of paper quite a clear route to the factory: from her office pass two crossings,\
  \ get to the bridge, ride till the first turn to the right and find the factory\
  \ there. The journey promised to take about half an hour. \nSo, I was riding forward,\
  \ with a light breeze playing in my hair, and a beatific smile didn't leave my face.\
  \ I still remember me giving nice smiles to every stranger. Could we imagine then\
  \ the challenge we were to face? After about an hour of riding retro bikes, we realized\
  \ that something went wrong. With high hills lying in front of us, the straight\
  \ road was gradually turning into a route for professional bike racers. It didn\u2019\
  t seem to have any turns to the right. It was midday and the temperature reached\
  \ above 40 degrees. It seemed to us that if someone tried to step on the road his\
  \ shoes would immediately melt and stick to the ground, so we had nothing to do\
  \ but to ride forward. Our interest to the factory was stirred up by the locals\
  \ we met now and then. Surely, they couldn\u2019t speak any language we could understand\
  \ but they nodded and smiled kindly, as though telling us we were about to reach\
  \ our goal.  \nAt some moment the heat became unbearable, the deserted road showed\
  \ rare trees. All we could see was a wide open valley burnt out by the sun. I was\
  \ so exhausted that my head was absolutely empty and I could hardly keep my tears\
  \ back. We realized we had to finish our journey but did we have any chance to get\
  \ back to the town? We turned back. Only one thought came into my head: \u201CA\
  \ car. We need a car.\u201D But our solitude was disturbed just by a few insects.\
  \ The moment I felt absolutely despaired a small lorry came from nowhere. It was\
  \ full with grown-ups and children. A cheerful old man helped us to climb inside\
  \ and tied our bikes to the outside of the lorry. I could find room there only when\
  \ I was squeezed up among others. The lorry moved. I looked around me \u2013 the\
  \ people were singing, laughing, a small girl fell asleep on my knees. Only then\
  \ I realized that all my pains were worth that very moment to find myself there\
  \ with these people."
