Text: "It was year 2013.. My age didn\u2019t include a 2 in the tens yet. I had never\
  \ been away from home, beyond  the rigurous fortnightly summer camp. Both mum and\
  \ dad were unemployed and I was in a two-years relationship with a college mate.\
  \ However, I decided to apply.\nErasmus. Such a big word. Huge. I had heard many\
  \ stories about it. \u201CBest year of my life\u201D, \u201Cdon\u2019t even hesitate\u201D\
  , \u201Cbest decision ever\u201D. With all these opinions, how could I resist to\
  \ temptation? But I had an one and only clear purpose: improving my English language\
  \ skills. I would go to the bleakest corner of England in order to achieve my goal.\
  \ Although I hate rain. Although the absence of sunlight and I are not the best\
  \ of friends. But it didn\u2019t matter. I knew my aim; who or what would be big\
  \ enough to stop me?\nAnd September arrived, and I was given the grant. And so did\
  \ my boyfriend. And so did three close friends of mine. And what a coincidence,\
  \ all of us got Nottingham. I lost both the fear of loneliness and of ending my\
  \ relationship. So, with a negative budget, I packed and left just thinking  about\
  \ two things: making native friends and finding a job.\nBut as son as I stepped\
  \ on Robin Hood \u2018s land, things got rough. No heating or inhabitants in my\
  \ new house, a boyfriend that became friend, but, especially, the impossibility\
  \ of making an English friend. Would it be my accent? Wasn\u2019t I friendly enough?\
  \ A total mistery. What I learnt is that my two pillars had moved from solid railroads\
  \ to blurred lines. 2013. I could never get along with odd numbers.\nMy grandma\
  \ used to say that \u201Ceverything changes\u201D. And she was definitely right.\
  \ As the new year came in, my luck changed. Or maybe I just realised that things\
  \ would not go the way I expected, so I accepted alternatives. I found a job as\
  \ a waitress, I was contacted by two girls willing to arrange language-exchange\
  \ meetings, I made lots of international friends and my house was suddenly full\
  \ of roommates.\nAnd June arrived, and I did not come back home. But my boyfriend\
  \ did. And so did the three close friends of mine. And what a surprise, I hadn\u2019\
  t met my target, at least not the way I wanted to. I had overcome the two obstacles\
  \ that made me doubt about undertaking this journey: both my relationship and money\
  \ troubles. So, with a positive balance, I packed and left somewhere else just thinking\
  \  about two things: the fact that grandmas are always right, and that \u201Cwanderlust\u201D\
  \ had replaced \u201Chome\u201D in the dictionary of my life."
