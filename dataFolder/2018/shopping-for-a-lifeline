Text: "All the months of unpredictable morbid weather was scrapped from my memory.\
  \ The skies were bluer than I had ever seen them in months. Surrounded by mountains\
  \ with patches of green shrubs stood the little city of Cuenca, its pastel coloured\
  \ buildings perfectly centred between two mountain peaks. Overwhelmed with emotions\
  \ that I still struggle to articulate, I took a deep breath in to settle the explosion\
  \ of tears. There were no fences or bars to hold one back from one slipping on a\
  \ rock and falling off the cliff and into the narrow stream below\u2013 so I carefully\
  \ lifted myself to my feet. \nIt was time to leave soon, so I pulled out my phone\
  \ from my now ashy blue backpack that was also resting on the dry mud. Turning on\
  \ my phone to get to its camera was a routine; but, when I brought it up to snap\
  \ a picture, nothing happened. In fact, the screen was black.  I continued holding\
  \ the phone up, staring at it, as if expecting it to awaken. Eventually the painful\
  \ pierce of the rock in my shoe woke me up. My phone was dead! My phone had my only\
  \ map that would aid me in my forty minute walk back to the train station, my phone\
  \ had my train ticket, my phone had a phone for help. Suddenly, the quaint fairytale\
  \ town started to feel terrifying. I took another deep breath and began to retrace\
  \ my steps back to the train station. The anxiety induced cold sweat was becoming\
  \ unbearable, and I began jogging on the swaying bridge that would bring back to\
  \ the mainland. My body\u2019s sudden tiredness justified the anxiously increased\
  \ heart rate, giving my mind some solace.\nI stopped for a moment to breathe. \xBF\
  Que Pasa? \"What happened?\" A middle-aged man with hair glossy from gel like a\
  \ fresh magazine walked out of a store. I whipped my head to the left and realized\
  \ where I was. It was the Indian grocer who had earlier excitedly stepped out of\
  \ his store's doorframe to ask me if I too was Indian. We bonded over our shared\
  \ experiences being Indian in Spain, our differences, and he told me about his wife\
  \ and introduced me to his young daughter who helped in the store. I was thankful\
  \ to see him. I hurriedly explained my situation in a mix of Spanish and Hindi as\
  \ my thoughts were lost in a tornado of urgency and translation. The grocer smiled.\
  \ \n\"I will call the taxi for you.\" I looked down, embarrassed. I have a terrible\
  \ habit to not plan when travelling. This time, I was saved by a person I met while\
  \ hunting for a Nispero to feed my craving. I didn't even realize there were taxi's\
  \ here."
