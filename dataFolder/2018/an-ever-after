Text: "The country with its chaos, commotion, constant honking, and overfed air did\
  \ not for a moment became repulsive. Somehow, this little coastal nation powerfully\
  \ allured all sorts of nomads; the rooted and the adrift. I loved how the turgid\
  \ air bared itself as beads of sweat as I stared at a melodramatic sky with a pleasantly\
  \ empty mind every evening while she taught our 2-year-old how to handle the oncoming\
  \ waves. Since that first coffee at a cozy shanty in the mountains, I knew that\
  \ she could be poetry. Both of us had walked in together, not oblivious of each\
  \ other. Ragged, unkempt, and positively not clean we both sat at our respective\
  \ tables. Mine still raked of traces of a former occupant, hers I do not recollect,\
  \ just that she was settled. Luckily, our orders were mixed up and we were both\
  \ compelled to look at each other and nodded. A dynamic closeness seeped in quickly\
  \ and we knew that this moment must be shared. \n\n\u201CArabica!\u201D I exclaimed\
  \ prefixing this utterance with a happy-gratified moan. She hummed and asked, \u201C\
  Do you hear music when you sip your coffee?\u201D I was caught unaware by that ice-breaker\
  \ nonetheless it was the sweetest I had ever heard. Soon the conversation drifted\
  \ toward to what we loved. \u201CPoetry! I said.\u201D \u201CChildren,\u201D she\
  \ said. No wonder then that she had come to volunteer at a school in this remote\
  \ Himalayan village while I was here on a hike. As the discussion on romanticism\
  \ about mountains and off the grid living passionately ensued, her sobering realism\
  \ about travel and a willful giving up of modern comforts, emboldened my own aspirations\
  \ of encountering threats that a life of normalcy would never offer. \u201CSilly,\
  \ me! Don't listen to all I blabber about.\u201D She said, \u201CI am not an example\
  \ to follow.\u201D She was so wrong. \n\nFive years since \u201CI am not an example\
  \ to follow\u201D, and the last thing I expected back then, following that conversation,\
  \ was that our meetings would become one too many; that we would wreck our minds\
  \ for hours hunting no man's land. Or the fact that after 3 years of intermittent\
  \ travels, we would search places which are kid and LGBT-friendly. Luckily, our\
  \ present humid haven is both barring the skeptical glance here and there. Here\
  \ we are dealing with a life that each journey unfolds which can be both fulfilling\
  \ as well as hostile. Still, we get by fine especially when I look at her and our\
  \ daughter against the rising moon; so much more dreamy than the celestial melodrama\
  \ in the background. Poetic? Definitely."
