Text: "Amid the crowd of devotees of Kali\u2013the Hindu Goddess of destruction\u2013\
  at Kalighat temple in Calcutta was a wedding procession. A few resident kids ran\
  \ alongside. The wedding party brought along a few kids as well. Baby goats. I put\
  \ myself in the fold and was swept away from the main prayer room and toward a back\
  \ room devoted to sacrifice. Ah. These young goats were being offered. Better than\
  \ the children, I supposed.\n\nThe executioner grabbed a goat. Quickly was the neck\
  \ thrust into a large U-shaped stone and the bar set, pinning his head in place.\
  \ The goat writhed and yelled and kicked and kicked. The thing about a baby goat\
  \ screaming is that they actually sound like a child. Shunk. The axe glided across\
  \ the rock-face. The kid's head dropped with a dull thud. Immediately the body shot\
  \ back. With nerves still pumping, the now headless torso kicked against the floor.\
  \ In the instant that followed the fall of the axe, and the head with it, the groom\
  \ poured whiskey over both the stone and the severed head. The bride, wearing a\
  \ regal veil, henna, and extravagant jewelry, looked on. The room, however, was\
  \ not yet silent.\n\nSecond kid. He screamed (only males are sacrificed). Again,\
  \ the iron bar locked down the goat's neck while the animal railed against his fate\
  \ with all his will. The attendant dropped the axe across the caprine neck. Again,\
  \ the decapitated body recoiled from the nervous impulse and jolted back. A puddle\
  \ of blood and whiskey received the head with a splat. And except for the clatter\
  \ of hooves connected to a headless torso lying in a pool of blood, silence reigned.\n\
  \nThis event did not pass comfortably across my eyes. But, forsaking such a momentary\
  \ disquietude, I stayed throughout. In the moments following each beheading, a stream\
  \ of calmness flooded my mind. When the screaming ceased, a resignation to mortality\
  \ overtook me\u2014its inevitability for each of us; the terror that surrounds the\
  \ death stroke this side of the axe; the serene release I imagine it to be for the\
  \ one who takes the underside.    \nUpon the conclusion of the sacrificial doubleheader,\
  \ each member of the wedding party received an anointment of whiskey and blood.\
  \ The groom motioned me over. I dipped my middle finger in the shallow pool of whiskey-blood\
  \ sacrament and painted with an upward motion a vertical line between my eyebrows.\
  \ We all took turns bowing down to touch our heads to the sacrificial stone, knowing\
  \ that one day, in some form, we will all end up on the cutting block."
