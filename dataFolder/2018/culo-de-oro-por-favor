Text: "It was long, long ago, when the grass was greener and I was younger - just\
  \ 14 years old. Our first month in Mexico. I remember these days pretty well. I\
  \ was discovering the country and plunging into another world, totally different\
  \ from Hungary, Latvia, Germany and Russia where I had lived before.\n- What about\
  \ your b-day wishlist, my dear? Have you already made it? - The morning was sunny\
  \ and sweet just like my mom\u2019s voice. She was sitting on my bed in front of\
  \ the window and her ginger hair looked like halo in the sunlight. \n- The Golden\
  \ Fleece! I want a gold pendant in the shape of Aries! - My answer was fast and\
  \ well prepared. \nAfter the breakfast it was decided that father would take me\
  \ and mom to the jewelry market. I loved spring Mexico City. Colorful flowers, tender\
  \ sunbeams and the light smell of mango. Our car was sliding through the April warmth.\
  \ Patchy pictures were following in quick succession like Instagram feed (I\u2019\
  d say today) but at that time I was living without Internet. Happily. Finally we\
  \ reached the jewelry market. I hadn\u2019t seen so many chains, bracelets, pendants,\
  \ rings and earrings in one place before. This precious kaleidoscope waltzed me\
  \ round. Mayan calendar, Quetzalcoatl, jaguars... The choice was really great. But\
  \ Aries\u2026 None! \n- May be we should ask sellers about such pendants? - My mom\
  \ proposed. \nIt was a good idea, even a brilliant one but the problem was that\
  \ I didn\u2019t know either \u201CAries\u201D or \u201Cpendant\u201D in Spanish.\
  \ And the salesmen refused to understand English. Suddenly a solution crossed my\
  \ mind. I simply tried to pronounce a Russian word in the Spanish manner. In the\
  \ event it turned out to be a mighty big mistake. \nI came up to the counter with\
  \ the richest assortment. The seller was a smiley white-toothed jelly-belly with\
  \ kind brown eyes. \n- Tiene un \u201Ccul\xF3n\u201D* de oro en forma de\u2026?\n\
  - Perd\xF3n? Que??? - The brown eyes became rather surprised than kind. \n- Un \u201C\
  cul\xF3n\u201D de oro...\n- Culo de oro? - He didn\u2019t look cheerful anymore,\
  \ but almost shocked. \n- Si, si! Un culo de oro!\n- Es lo \xFAltimo que esperaba\
  \ escuchar de Usted se\xF1orita!..- The salesman spread out his hands to... the\
  \ taco (obviously my question made him nervous). \nUltimately we found a gold Aries.\
  \ I still wear this pendant. Thanks to my smart classmates I learned out what \u201C\
  culo\u201D meant in Spanish and didn\u2019t use this word ever again (at least inadvertently).\
  \ But I would never forget this first attempt to make a local shopping connection...\
  \ \n*\u201DCulon\u201D means \u201Cpendant\u201D in Russian"
