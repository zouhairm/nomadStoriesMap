Text: "One day last week, I felt some homesickness. When I take these trips, I\u2019\
  m not used to anything so long term, even though 2 years is not long term, in the\
  \ scheme of life. I\u2019m not used to not being able to make a friend over conversation.\
  \ Everything runs together here. When I was sick, I wasn\u2019t focusing on learning\
  \ the language, which means not knowing directions, so only being able to get so\
  \ lost since you can\u2019t ask the way back. No phone, so no internet, so no google\
  \ maps and even on google maps, most of the places in this city do not show up.\
  \ There are no street names here anyway. I was thinking about what I love. And the\
  \ things I love felt so out of touch. Not able to jump on the motorcycle to see\
  \ my city, not able to cross the bridges to drink a $2 beer or take over the dance\
  \ floor by doing the shark between people grinding and definitely not able to give\
  \ or take a hug. I\u2019ve got pockets of sunshine stored, so I was able to feel\
  \ one and try to figure out some more balance. I needed to love on the sun and the\
  \ earth that hugs my body. Even though I have not hugged a human since PGH Intl.\
  \ Airport, the earth has been gripping my all every second I\u2019ve been here.\n\
  \nAfter the morning of feeling alone, I ended up having a beautiful day. I was walking\
  \ and one man at a restaurant said, \u201CHello, miss. How are you?\u201D WHAT?\
  \ One of the four Indonesians in Cirebon who know English?! I stopped to visit.\
  \ He invited me into the restaurant and his wife knew more English and his daughter\
  \ studies it in school on Saturdays. I ended up staying with them for three hours,\
  \ visiting. \n\nThe next night, I walked through the rain and joined his family\
  \ for dinner. He said that his daughter wants me to be her sister, so they asked\
  \ if I would join their family. \u201CCall me \u2018ayah\u2019 (papa), and you can\
  \ call Ayu \u2018bundah\u2019 (mother), and Canta your sister. You need a family\
  \ everywhere you go and your blood is not on these islands. So we give you love.\u201D\
  \n\nAfter a week of visiting them for 3-5 hours a night, I asked if I could do the\
  \ dishes or help out because they\u2019ve been feeding me. They laughed. Ayah said,\
  \ \u201CNo. No. You make us so happy. Why would we ask for anything in return? You\u2019\
  re happy, I\u2019m happy, Canta so happy, I so happy. We\u2019re Muslim & you\u2019\
  re not. Across the world, people think we\u2019re terrorists. And we\u2019re eating\
  \ rice with you over peace. Please be our guest. That\u2019s how it is in Indonesia.\
  \ You\u2019re of different skin and blood. And look. We still love you. We love\
  \ you. We love you.\u201D"
