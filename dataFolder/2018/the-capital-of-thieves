Text: "Paris. The city of love, beautiful architecture and croissants. I was lucky\
  \ enough to visit Paris with my boyfriend, Tom, for my 21st birthday late last year.\
  \ Our itinerary consisted of all the typical first-timer hotspots of Paris including\
  \ most obviously the Eiffel Tower, a river cruise along the Seine, a visit to the\
  \ Mona Lisa and Norte Dame and a trek to the top of the Arch De Triumph. \n\nAfter\
  \ taking more than enough selfies with the Eiffel Tower, we decided to take a stroll\
  \ along the river towards the direction of the Notre Dame. Now, I have heard from\
  \ friends that Paris, like any other major city, does have its fair share of pickpocketers\
  \ but being in the moment of just being in Paris, this tiny significant detail did\
  \ seem so slip my mind. \n\nA young, dark-haired man roughly my age interrupted\
  \ our autumnal walk and asked, \u201CAre you English?\u201D Being the polite English\
  \ woman that I am I answered \u201CYes,\u201D to which he replied \u201CCan you\
  \ sign this petition?\u201D The fact that there was no explanation as to what I\
  \ was signing and no one else had signed the petition did seem a little odd, which\
  \ is why I responded \u201CSorry,\u201D and walked off. \n\nWithin a flash I had\
  \ a group of 7 youths surround me shouting \u201CSIGN THIS,\u201D \u201CPLEASE SIGN,\u201D\
  \ \u201CSIGN, SIGN, SIGN!\u201D I struggled to escape the circle as all my exit\
  \ routes were blocked by clipboards. At this moment in time I then realised that\
  \ this could be a pickpocket attempt, to which I clutched on to my bag and tried\
  \ to barge my way out. Tom, my only help, was quite late to noticing the situation\
  \ I was in as he had one of the scammers talk to him separately which left him oblivious\
  \ to his surroundings. \n\nAfter escaping the circle of clipboards twice, I turned\
  \ around and noticed the same young, dark-haired man that approached me at the start\
  \ had my phone in his hand. But the surprising thing was, he was walking towards\
  \ me to hand it back!\n\nTo this day I\u2019m still not entirely sure why someone\
  \ would go through the effort and risk of stealing a phone and then hand it back.\
  \ The only explanation I can think of is that my phone at the time was not the stylish\
  \ of phones which could have played to my advantage in the grand return, or someone\
  \ from the team of scammers had an inner moment where they could see what they were\
  \ doing was completely immoral.  \n\nNow that was the last thing I expected."
