Text: "I am neither asleep, nor awake, suspended in a moment of serenity and expectation,\
  \ because without doubt this is the most comfortable bed I have ever slept on, a\
  \ small well organised layering of blankets, upon a floor of tatami mats. But like\
  \ everything else in this room I wait, in stillness, till i notice the pleasing\
  \ smell of freshly brewed green tea, sitting one foot from my face. The conundrum\
  \ is whether the smell of the tea woke me up or whether Mariko\u2019s mum, intuiting\
  \ my waking, pre-emptively prepared it. Either feat is remarkable, as I sensed neither\
  \ her coming nor going, and for me, that perfectly embodies Japan, a place of well\
  \ organised and respectfully crafted mysteries.\n\nThis trip would be impossible\
  \ without Mariko, the last time I had seen her was 2 years ago in Sydney, at the\
  \ Marriott Hotel, over a seafood buffet. The first image that comes to mind, is\
  \ her politely asking \u201Care you going to eat those?\u201D Pointing to my prawn\
  \ heads. When I indicated, they\u2019re all hers, she picks one up, with petite\
  \ hands dripping in long nails, upon which tiny worlds have been built, jewels and\
  \ gems, each fingernail, a seperate work of art, so distracting I almost forget\
  \ she\u2019s about to suck the juice out of a prawn head, until she exclaims \u201C\
  oishii\u201D (tasty), smiles and repeats the act passionately until they\u2019re\
  \ gone from all our plates.\n\nBut this trip would be equally impossible without\
  \ Mariko\u2019s father, a bear of a man. A gentle giant, an ex-architect turned\
  \ rice farmer, he stood quietly watching me later that day, as I looked at a collection\
  \ of postcards, and ticket stubs, from Mariko\u2019s trips abroad, splashes of colour\
  \ and text, riots of outrageousness sandwiched beneath glass on a table in this\
  \ perfectly organised home. After 4 days, seeing him only towards dusk or dawn,\
  \ Mariko would explain, that this towering lumberjack of a man, was scared of me.\
  \ Shocked and surprised I\u2019d ask her why? \u201CYou\u2019re the first foreigner\
  \ he\u2019s ever meet!\u201D she said with a smile.\n\nThe sheer fact he was terrified\
  \ of how to behave around me, just as I was uncertain of how to behave around him,\
  \ highlighted the generosity of his gesture, of letting his daughter, bring some\
  \ alien soul from across the ocean into their home, to sleep, eat, walk and talk,\
  \ was truly moving. It is this opening of hearts and homes, that humbles the spirit\
  \ and reminds us that sometimes, it is the uniqueness of a local experience that\
  \ is a gift that only grows more valuable with time."
