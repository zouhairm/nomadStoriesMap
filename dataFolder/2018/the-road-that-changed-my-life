Text: "This was rich real-estate; Pearl Street, the down-town walking mall of Boulder,\
  \ Colorado.  A town in which an out-of-state college student would pay 26,000 dollars\
  \ a semester\u2014enough money to live well in a poor country for years.  So much\
  \ had changed in me in the last week that I suddenly felt sick when I had this revelation.\
  \  I had wanted to see more of America for a long time, and without the needed money\
  \ I decided to travel solo, with only a backpack for company.\n\n It wasn\u2019\
  t a day into my travels that I spent six hours sitting on an interstate on-ramp\
  \ waiting for a ride.  My body was sore\u2014I had filled my backpack until it weighed\
  \ 60 pounds\u2014and I was more tired and depressed sitting there in the gravel\
  \ than at the end of any work day.  Only 50 miles from home, I started wondering\
  \ if I should give up. \n\n Luckily, I didn\u2019t stop.  Those experiences of mild\
  \ suffering gave me a new perspective on all the luxuries I had previously enjoyed.\
  \  I would dream of the comfort of a bed and the price of gas never seemed so low.\
  \  My outlook was beginning to change, but there was more to grasp. \n\n One day\
  \ as I was walking north on Highway 93 towards Boulder, a man stopped to pick me\
  \ up.  I immediately felt that I could trust him.  He seemed to understand what\
  \ I was doing and wanted to support me.  Our conversation and the lunch he bought\
  \ me left me feeling rich.  The knowledge that there are good people like this was\
  \ priceless.  It was something that I could only discover by becoming truly vulnerable.\n\
  \n Thus, I exited a cycle of hardships, and started to receive gifts.  I found a\
  \ friend in Boulder with a van and three dogs.  Now I had transportation and a place\
  \ to sleep.  If the help from a stranger made me feel rich, I now felt invincible.\
  \  Our plan was to head west and to see if anyone else wanted to join us.\n\n So\
  \ there I was, sitting with the dogs at my feet and my cardboard sign.  I guess\
  \ the passing people were giving me money because the dogs and the cardboard sign\
  \ were sending a stronger message than the words written in black marker.   It was\
  \ a new experience to have no desire for money and be completely content with what\
  \ I had.  I now had my feet planted firmly on the asphalt, with a new appreciation\
  \ for the small things.  No longer dreaming of perfect adventures, for now I knew\
  \ the struggles often lead to personal growth.  Growth that was worth more than\
  \ just traveling for views."
