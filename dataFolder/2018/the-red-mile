Text: "There\u2019s a famous Bengali song that begins thus : \u2018Gram Chara Oi Ranga\
  \ Mati-r Poth\u2019 which translates to something like \u2018\u2019There goes the\
  \ red road to the village\u2019\u2019.  In Bengal, and parts of Eastern India, the\
  \ natural soil (mati) color is a shade of red (ranga). Reddish-Orange. Kolkata,\
  \ my city, however is perennially grey with its concrete - albeit pothole-ridden\
  \ - roads. \n\nIn the soft glow of the setting sun, the red of the soil beamed brighter\
  \ than ever. Green beds of paddy soaked in water -  on either side of the narrow\
  \ lane- imparted a salty smell in the air. On the meandering pathway, faint outlines\
  \ emerged. My pace quickened.    \n\nA rooster fluttered out of a nearby bush startling\
  \ me for a moment. I moved ahead and stopped near the first mud hut in sight. Neat\
  \ white paintings on the walls greeted me. The face of a young girl peeped out from\
  \ behind a saree, acting as a partition. On the porch, the smiling Mother separated\
  \ husk from rice grains. The silver of her nose pin sparkled against the last rays\
  \ of the sun. Slightly hesitant, the girl came out of her hiding. Her Father was\
  \ out in the fields, she told me softly. \n\nBeneath the thatched roof of the next\
  \ hut, sat a man, quietly making perfect mud figurines. His sweaty chin a mess of\
  \ salt and pepper. He sold those tiny creations at the town market, earning him\
  \ enough to have two square meals a day. \n\nA little further on, sat a young mother\
  \ rocking her youngest in a wicker basket. An old man with long flowing white beard\
  \ and a hint of a smile, stared on, from the nearby charpoy. On the narrow stretch\
  \ between the huts, the father taught his brood to roll tire with a twig. \n\nAnd\
  \ then, there was this young man. The only one in that settlement with electricity.\
  \ He used the limited power load to install a TV and - what looked to me - a rather\
  \ simple motorized machine to cut and polish metal. Two heads bobbed up and down\
  \ against the window grill from within the hut. The man lined his unfinished pieces\
  \ of Dokra craft on a rickety table top, just outside the hut. Dokra is a 4,000\
  \ year-old metal-casting technique. Its rustic beauty might not appeal to all but\
  \ it does/did to me. He acknowledged my presence with a nod and went back to work.\
  \  \n\nLife seemed peaceful. Barely 4 hours away, a war waged on. For clean drinking\
  \ water, food, basic infrastructure. \n\nDaylight had begun to fizzle out. A mild\
  \ breeze blew, sending red dust flying everywhere. I started on my way back. The\
  \ red of the soil, now more orange."
