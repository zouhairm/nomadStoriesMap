Text: "It was really cold that night I just got out of the car that dropped me at\
  \ my friend's home in Potrero Hill. Wind howling and fog really hurting my cheeks.\
  \ But had nothing to do with something that few hours ago started to grow inside\
  \ of me. Something I could never hold back for a long time ahead, and that even\
  \ today still haunts me sometimes. Anyway, the thing was that from that same day,\
  \ my life seemed about to change dramatically, if it was not going to change enough\
  \ undertaking that crazy trip itself.\n\nI have never been able to figure out what\
  \ the hell crossed my mind the moment that I put that piece of paper in my bag.\
  \ But I did it. And I did it for good. I reckon I did it for a reason too. But that\
  \ reason never came up again from my buried thoughts, and I prefer my subconscious\
  \ keep it that way. So there it was: this small once-blank page pulled out from\
  \ the poetry book that I once happened to write. I took a pic of it with my shabby\
  \ phone, and sent her few moments before to get on the plane, right there from the\
  \ boarding gate. They were some words that I wanted to let her know in another time,\
  \ and I never did. And popped up to the surface again in the right time, when casually\
  \ I had the news that she was going through some rough situation right then.\n\n\
  She answered fast, and before we had the chance to be aware of what the next words\
  \ we were saying were about to mean, she had her tickets. \n\nThe next 23 days were\
  \ likely the most stupidly beautiful experience we both ever lived. We got on a\
  \ car from 716 Potrero St. and went over the old land of California. Going through\
  \ Yosemite, stopping at Lake Tahoe, sleeping in a Palm Springs motel, or driving\
  \ across the Highway One and the Big Sur... we found love as no one of the two of\
  \ us could have ever wondered.\n\nThe refraction of light polluted by the holy smoke\
  \ of the mad highways of Los Angeles, is certainly one of the best-case-scenarios\
  \ to fall in love. Or spending the night awake hearing the sea lions bark. Not to\
  \ mention the gig by The Growlers in that small desert town called Pioneertown.\
  \ And the moon, that huge moon... So you could tell finding bugs in your sheets\
  \ when you sleep in a cheap motel in San Diego should be an unpleasant moment for\
  \ anyone. We just laughed and fucked over them. Literally. \n\nBut the best was\
  \ yet about to come... Because my real purpose for the trip was to find a job and\
  \ stay the summer, and that trip left with just 100 $ in my wallet, and a bunch\
  \ of more stories to tell... GE"
