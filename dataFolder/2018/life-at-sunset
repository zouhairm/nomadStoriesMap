Text: "My name is Jennifer O'Brien, I am an ambitious, creative 21 year old; and hungry\
  \ for an opportunity to grow through this experience.\n Originally, I'm from Boston\
  \ Massachusetts, on the east coast of the US. I was 14 years old when I started\
  \ working in the Fashion Industry in New England. Working my way up from Intern,\
  \ to personal assistant, and then to Lead Makeup Artist at the age of 19, until\
  \ 20. I always was aware of my love for the arts growing up wether it was painting\
  \ on a canvas, transforming a human face or writing an creative essays in my english\
  \ classes. Starting so young in the fashion world created my focus to only relate\
  \ around the aspects of that particular industry, because thats what i knew best.\
  \ At 21 I started to become bored, makeup wasn't fulfilling my creative outlet enough\
  \ anymore, and I knew this wasn't what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. I\
  \ started looking into what other sides of the industry I could enjoy and be good\
  \ at; and hopefully fulfill that desire I so badly had, to create. I left Makeup\
  \ Artistry to intern with TES Stylist. I interned with them for a year, until they\
  \ then hired me as an assistant Stylist. I had my career set in stone for me there,\
  \ falling in love with my co-workers and creating life long friendships. I could\
  \ have easily worked my way up that ladder, just as I had done before. But still,\
  \ something was digging at me inside. I knew that this just wasn't my soul purpose.\
  \ I had a gut feeling that I had to leave Boston in order to figure out what that\
  \ purpose was. I could feel that door closing and \n knew another one opening. LA\
  \ was calling my name and I couldn't turn it down. I moved out to California in\
  \ the fall of this year, and it has been four months since landing. The decision\
  \ to leave the fashion world has pushed me more than any experience ever has. It\
  \ has been much harder than I initially thought getting a good job out here was\
  \ going to be. With pressure from parents and friends back home routing me on...\
  \ but, I am happier than I have ever been. Even though the grind and hustle that\
  \ it takes to chase dreams, and adapt in a whole new setting. The reward of the\
  \ feeling of moving forward is all I need. Moving across the country by myself has\
  \ been an eye opening, and truly humbling experience. Im still growing each day\
  \ and trying to get closer my truest passion that sends that rush of magic energy\
  \ down my spine, but I know I'm in the right place to finally find just that. And\
  \ I'm closer than ever."
