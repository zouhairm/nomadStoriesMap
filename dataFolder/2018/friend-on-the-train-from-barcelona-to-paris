Text: "I tell you, if ever I find myself in Spain, I shall head for Barcelona and\
  \ train it to the northeast. I saw amazing towns that were on the cliffs. They were\
  \ literally right off the water. I saw boats at the ready to head for fish from\
  \ the sea. This is the way to live, methinks.\nWhilst on my journey northwards,\
  \ I watched the rain and fell asleep. It was so peaceful on the train. I had a neighbor\
  \ who recognized that I was American. He made conversation about the Lakers and\
  \ the NBA in general. I tried to talk to him as best I could but I failed. He said\
  \ he was from Cerb\xE8re but he moved to Spain as he felt more Spanish than French.\
  \ Cerb\xE8re was a border town so I can see how one would want to pick sides. We\
  \ rapped as best we could in our lack of language. I knew just enough Spanish to\
  \ figure out the gist of what he was saying and he knew just enough English to understand\
  \ my replies. We had a moment where we looked at each other and knew we were sports\
  \ fans, basketball fans. He had to leave so he looked at me and grabbed my checks\
  \ and said, \u2018trie\_ bien.\u2019\u2019 He knew that this was the one time he\
  \ would talk to an American as I knew this was my one time talking with a real Spaniard.\
  \ One of the best train rides I had on this voyage.\nI arrived in France around\
  \ 5 pm. We had about 20 min before the connecting train left for Paris. I ran into\
  \ a train employee named Boris. He advised me to just wait until everyone checked\
  \ in before I did. \nI had to haggle with the French ticket lady. We both didn\u2019\
  t understand each other so we did lots of pointing. This took about 3 minutes to\
  \ negotiate as we had a mediator who barely understood either language. Once we\
  \ knew that I had to have some coins so as to make exact change, I soon had a ticket.\
  \ Turned out to be around 20\u20AC for the trip. This was for a 6 bunk sleeper.\
  \ I didn\u2019t realize it at first but I had to open my compartment each time another\
  \ rider joined which lasted throughout the night. I thought I had it all in my 6\
  \ bunk world. We were given dinner which consisted of Twix 2 pack and water. It\
  \ was enough for this section of the journey. The trains slow progress lulled me\
  \ to sleep\_quickly."
