Text: "I\u2019ve got an invitation to join JWRP Momentum Trip to Israel. The trip\
  \ lasted during eight days. It was girls\u2019 quality time among 200 more Jewish\
  \ women from all over the world. It was amazing to observe us: multicolored crazy\
  \ drifting women, smiling, hugging and embracing each other. But it was so easy\
  \ to distinct our groups according to our pashminas: blue for Moscow, red for Saint\
  \ Petersburg etc. One colour for each country. \u201CWhat\u2019s going on?\u201D\
  \ \u2013 The barmen asked me in the lobby of our hotel \u2013 \u201CWhere are your\
  \ men?\u201D \u201CAt home. \u2013 I answered him \u2013 And we\u2019re here to\
  \ learn how to become a good Jewish mom and wife.\u201D \n\nEach woman came here\
  \ on her own: to mingle, to see Israeli, to learn more about Jewish traditions &\
  \ religion, to talk to psychologists, to take a chance to handle her problems, to\
  \ find new friends or just understand how to live this life. All of us were united\
  \ because we were Jewish. \nWe saw different towns: Tiberius and the huge Sea of\
  \ Galilee. Right after our arrival to the Holy Land, we\u2019ve got our bracelets\
  \ endorsed by: Don\u2019t blame, don\u2019t complain! \n\nBefore arriving to the\
  \ Dead Sea, we visited famous Masada \u2013 an ancient fort on the top of the desert\
  \ rock that was built by the king Herod the Great. There\u2019s famous, romantic,\
  \ though bloody story about heroic deeds and wars of Jewish Nation. It was a good\
  \ place to provide Jewish Name ceremony. Amazing how the ancient words sounded through\
  \ the silence of the desert.\n\nAnd we visited the Bedouins, rode the camels and\
  \ dined inside their village. And we danced a lot. Just imagine 200 Jewish women\
  \ who sat in a circle playing tam-tams like thousands years ago. It turned out so\
  \ easy to loose these centuries while listening to barbaric music. One by one, we\
  \ danced our ass off in a wild whirlwind.\n\nAnd there was Safed, a small traditional\
  \ town on the top of the mountain. We saw many gold and exotic women in the tall\
  \ bright turbans. We visited ancient synagogue and mikvah and learnt how a few years\
  \ ago a woman came here from Washington and fall in love with Safed so much that\
  \ decided to stay here forever. \n\nWe\u2019ve got many emotions, learnt new incredible\
  \ stories. During the last evening, we lighted candles and shared our feelings.\
  \ I lost and didn\u2019t know what to say, and understood it just after arrival\
  \ at home: during this trip I became a believer. I believe in a miracle. It happens\
  \ thanks to many kind and generous people. And if you don\u2019t know where to find\
  \ them, come to Israel and seek here!"
