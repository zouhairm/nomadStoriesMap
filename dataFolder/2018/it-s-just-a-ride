Text: "I was pushed upwards, away from my seat, into that split-second-feeling of\
  \ zero gravity. Every time I hit the seat again, reality and the limited comfort\
  \ of Cameroonian speed bumps hit just as hard. \n\nThe bus was cramped. Constructed\
  \ for maybe twenty, thirty people did not know the meaning of personal space on\
  \ public transportation. I was lucky enough to sit near a window, where the fresh\
  \ airstream offered some relief from the boiling sunbeams and the stuffiness. Still,\
  \ on rides my mind and eyes are always able to wander off, away from my immediate\
  \ surroundings. \n\nThe flying by of the landscape had a calming effect on me. I\
  \ tried to let the colors and shapes soak in. Green fields and hills, dry dusty\
  \ roads, colorful clothing, bars and fruit stands \u2013 all of that got engraved\
  \ into my memory. In the background, the driver blasted some African beats. It was\
  \ the first time I really got to discover and enjoy the local music. I mentally\
  \ thanked the driver for his playlist, which worked like a soundtrack to my thoughts.\
  \ I glanced at him. He was balancing a cigarette in his mouth and smoothly steered\
  \ the wheel to avoid the potholes, which he all knew by heart.\n\nThe trip north\
  \ of Nkongsamba, to the university city of Dschang, was the first we took during\
  \ our stay in Cameroon. My eyes were thirsty for new discoveries, different roads\
  \ and a different city. Located in the Littoral region, our home base was a small\
  \ town of 115,000 habitants. After a few weeks, an escape from the lovable enclave\
  \ was desperately needed. Dschang seemed like a good idea. Our friend, waiting to\
  \ accommodate us, said 'It's just a quick one-hour-ride'. \n\nOur busses engine\
  \ did not agree with quick and easy travels. After having passed most of the way,\
  \ we reached a mountain's bottom. The winding street up had to be crested by our\
  \ vehicle. Driver and machine were equally fighting to get us to the top. The landscapes\
  \ became less blurry, the air warmer. I brought my face closer to the window. After\
  \ maybe the tenth curve, I suddenly had an epiphany like never before. The sun was\
  \ only glimmering now. In front of me laid the lands that we had passed before and\
  \ they seemed to be never-ending. It reminded me of watching the horizon of the\
  \ ocean, so far and yet so seemingly easy to reach. Another narrow curve and the\
  \ magical moment was already gone.\n\nI knew that I would never forget that simple\
  \ bus ride."
