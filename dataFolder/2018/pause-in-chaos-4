Text: "The stone buildings of Islamic Cairo have been standing for a thousand years\
  \ with their carved walls and tall minarets. I hadn't explored that part of the\
  \ city yet, so I followed Google maps until the Al Ghouri complex without a specific\
  \ plan. The complex is a collection of madares (schools), mosques and fortresses\
  \ built in the 1500s. There weren't any signs and the streets were filled with small\
  \ shops offering from hijabs to lace underwear.\n\nI walked up to the door of a\
  \ mosque, leaving all the buzzing shoppers below. I peeked in and a man came out,\
  \ offering me a \"free\" tour. I accepted. \"Hurry hurry\" he said. We took off\
  \ our shoes, passed through the main floor of the mosque and went up some stairs.\
  \ Right on time. The man took two dusty carpets from a corner, kneeled on his and\
  \ gave me one to sit. At that moment a voice started to \"sing\" the first lines\
  \ of the Quran to encourage everyone to come and pray. I immediately heard dozens\
  \ of unique voices in the distance, one after the other, fighting for the attention\
  \ of 20 million people. I felt I was imposing on a private ritual, but he assured\
  \ me there was no problem and I could take pictures if I wanted. I felt he was proud\
  \ of showing me this side of his life. \n\n5 minutes later the man had finished,\
  \ and we continued our tour. His name was Mahmoud and he was from Upper Egypt. He\
  \ told me in broken English that he had two sons who also worked in tourism. He\
  \ kept going up and I kept following through the narrow staircase, eager to reach\
  \ the top of the mosque's minaret. \n\nBelow us was Al-Azhar street. I could still\
  \ here the honking of the tiny cars and the growing rumble of the city at noon.\
  \ In Cairo, honking has its own language, so you can swear at someone with three\
  \ long honks followed by a short one or tell them I love you with two short honks\
  \ and 3 long ones. I stood there for a few minutes thinking of why I was in Egypt,\
  \ how defeated I was feeling just a few hours earlier when I had gotten lost in\
  \ the metro and how calm I felt then, slowly analyzing how the rushed pedestrians\
  \ jumped over cars to cross the street, the women's colorful hijabs, the men's galabeyas\
  \ (white long tunics) and the layer of sand that covered the fruit carts and every\
  \ surface in sight. Everyone was moving, everyone except us. We were the outsiders.\
  \ Eventually we came down, I gave him a tip and took a deep breath before leaving\
  \ the mosque, he took the money and slowly went inside to continue his work."
