Text: "Connor and I thought we\u2019d spend one night in Utah, seeing as we only went\
  \ there to escape a blizzard. We ended up touring around for 3 months and the paragon\
  \ of our trip was Zion. All around the park were characters of old stories; trails\
  \ wound up their rocky shoulders onto outstretched palms. As the sunlight changed,\
  \ so did the sandstone. It was like watching a painter build layers over time. We\
  \ saw birds and bugs that looked tropical, and lizards that did push-ups. We even\
  \ saw the cacti in bloom. Of course, we found adventure there too.\n The Virgin\
  \ River was red. The gear shop was closed, and so were some trails. We chose a route\
  \ that was clear and hiked the emerald pools. The way in was perfect. We only walked\
  \ through one section of shallow water, which ran over multicolored stones; it was\
  \ like walking on pearls. The uppermost pools were filled by a fantastic waterfall.\
  \ Starting on a high plateau, the water dropped off a precipice, fell 110 ft., and\
  \ crashed into a green pool. We loved climbing in the cave around it. We even braved\
  \ the cold, September water. \n We made it back to the open before we heard the\
  \ explosion. Behind us, 100\u2019s of tonnes of water now burst over the rim. Had\
  \ we taken more time to rest under that fall, we would\u2019ve been smacked down.\
  \ We decided to investigate, but the stream was impassable. We stopped to stare\
  \ and were pelted by the spray. At one point we couldn\u2019t even hear each other\
  \ over the noise. People passed by, shaken, sodden, but otherwise fine, except they\
  \ told us an older man was trapped. Connor braved the giant boulders through the\
  \ river to see if he was okay, but there was no way the man could cross. While he\
  \ was not in danger, we didn\u2019t know how long before the flood would recede.\
  \ So, Connor volunteered to run to the ranger station to tell them the situation.\
  \ Meanwhile I reached where the waters once skimmed over the rocks, and was met\
  \ with a thigh high river. Crossing took time, especially for the families ahead,\
  \ passing children over cautiously. After scaling the sketchy pass, I met up with\
  \ Connor. Unfortunately, location made rescue impossible and we couldn\u2019t even\
  \ tell the man this since he wouldn\u2019t hear us.\n In the valley, the Virgin\
  \ River looked even angrier. The skies threatened rain, and exhaustion hung humidly\
  \ in the air. It all seemed surreal until we saw the news that seven died in Keyhole\
  \ canyon. For me, all this was a reminder that you can find adventure where you\
  \ least expect, and you can find danger too."
