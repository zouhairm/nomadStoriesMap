Text: "2016, Kaikoura.\nIt is the end if the trip, 4 weeks roadtripping and surfing\
  \ from Auckland and curling down to leave at Christchurch. One of my surfboard hasn\u2019\
  t been used. It\u2019s an old board. Its my first surfboard ever bought. Not the\
  \ best one ever. After 17 years I sold it in the surf shop at Kaikoura. The owner\
  \ was so friendly to buy the board, it was old, and wouldn\u2019t be more than decoration,...\
  \ we thought!\n\nLast month.\nDiscovering the South Island with minimalistic luggage.\
  \ The first item I took was my OruKayak. This foldable boat was 16kg of 30 kg that\
  \ I could take. Next in my duffel bag were my wetsuits & safety gear. That left\
  \ me with just 10 kg for my 5 weeks trip.\n\nOn the different planes that took me\
  \ to my destination, i figured out that as soon as I had my van I would first go\
  \ to the surf shop in Kaikoura, to find out if it would be possible to get my old\
  \ board back.\nArriving at Kaikoura, the shop had disappeared. It was a construction\
  \ site with signs pointing to a shop a few hundred meters further..\nThe owner was,\
  \ as friendly as before recognized me from 2 years ago, when I mentioned the board,\
  \ he was surprised en excited. He told me that his shop was completely ruined during\
  \ the earthQuake in November 2016. The roof came completely down, and one of the\
  \ only things surviving the unintended demolition was the Belgian surfboard pending\
  \ on the wall.\n\nAlthough NZ welcomes millions of tourists, it is possible to have\
  \ the most touristic sites exclusively for you. When it involves a walk a hike or\
  \ an drive, one of the options is getting up early.\n\nOn other option, the one\
  \ I went for, was having your own toys. The kayak gave me private encounters with\
  \ seals, dolphins and even a penguin. This toy took me at sea and on the lakes to\
  \ places where the only sound spoiling natures grandior was the quiet brushes of\
  \ my paddle on the water.\n\nOne of the most impressive trips was Tasman glacier.\
  \ This is where the foldable kayak comes to a highlight. Folding it into the backpack,\
  \ to get to the jetty, unfolding it and kayaking for one hour to come to the cliff\
  \ of the Glacier.\nA very hot day and a very cold lake, gave an impressive color\
  \ scheme. Paddling under the cliffs was as impressive as frightening. The sound\
  \ coming from this living creatures is similar to a summer's storm, like a thunder\
  \ growling from deep inside the ice. Constant ice and rock falling down, not simply\
  \ plashing, but with severe bangs hitting the water, made me back off with a few\
  \ strong paddles."
