Text: "The greatest thing about travelling with mad friends is that you are much madder.\
  \ And so when someone proposes to do weird thing, you answer \u201Cwhy not?\u201D\
  \ instead of \u201Care you insane?\u201D \nThis story begins like a typical travelling\
  \ to an unofficial capital of Western Ukraine, city filled with history and transformed\
  \ by time. Ancient streets and picturesque squares of Lviv City, mysterious building\
  \ structures and no less enigmatic legends of Old City all flavored with a scent\
  \ of freshly ground coffee can be found here. Wandering through streets, we unwittingly\
  \ feel the breath of centuries. We dreamt how medieval patio could have become our\
  \ personal dwelling place with a contemporary croissants\u2019 bakery on the opposite\
  \ side of the Renaissance street. \nTwo dreamy-but-nothing-to-our-name student girls,\
  \ whose motto is an eloquent watchword \u2013 \u201Csave as much money as you can,\
  \ while see as much world as you able\u201D \u2013 we decided that our world begins\
  \ with rural suburbs in 15 kilometers from Lviv City. \nHaving arrived there and\
  \ seen the bus moving off, at exactly that moment, we realize that there is no way\
  \ back. Several hours and dozens of kilometers after, a beautiful covered with trees\
  \ and bushes plant arbor with a spectacular view on a valley of a river and bondless\
  \ sky was chosen. Since it\u2019d been dusk already, a decision of staying in this\
  \ wooden-made apartment was apparently inevitable.  And the fact that we found a\
  \ bench (which meant we won\u2019t sleep on a ground) was a great advantage of it.\
  \ \nIn the morning, our logging place appeared to be not quite as scenic as at night.\
  \ River valley turned to be a creek and watering place for passing by cows, while\
  \ luxurious apartments became a cause of backache. Moreover, we find out that there\
  \ were no early buses, so the only possible chance to return to the civilization\
  \ is to run a 15-kilometer-forced race. (Well, I\u2019ve always wanted to do a serious\
  \ workout). \nFinally returned to the City and stopped grumbling about hard luck,\
  \ we realized what had happened during last 24 hours. Will it be sufficient to say\
  \ we were \u201Ca bit shocked\u201D? \u2013 we were frankly astonished by decisions\
  \ we\u2019d made, that decision which pushed us to our personal edges of capability.\
  \ \nFrom that time till now, when I am asked \u2018what are my abilities\u201D,\
  \ I answer surely enough that they are unlimited. Because no one can know the end\
  \ of one\u2019s potential until the final attempt."
