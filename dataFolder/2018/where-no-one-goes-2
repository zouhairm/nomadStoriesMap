Text: I am flt lt Mann frm IAF , i was part of longest all women joint BSF and IAF
  camel expedition , that flagged off from barmer uttarlai and ended at attari border
  amritsar covering a distance of 1468 kms only on camel . The aim of this expedition
  was to highlight female foeticide and cleanliness . I went on riding the camel to
  places where i found govt has not taken any care of its citizens , people on the
  border drank salty water , they didnt even have water to drink , no homes , no electricity
  , a total nomadic life even in 2018 . Marriages are done in same houses so awareness
  was also brought on its repurcursions health wise . We educated the families on
  female foeticide and cleanliness . Kids do not go to school as no school exist ,
  their earning is through cattle . Whatever basic education they get and even water
  is unofficially only on humanity ground is being provided by Border Security Force
  across the borders . I was spellbound to see that a soldier who gets limited water
  through water tank in such harsh terrains is even sparing some amount for sake of
  humanity to exist . I want to ask why our politicians dont go to such places ? I
  am a keen traveller i have been to many places but only in India but this one was
  an eye opener . Where you are giving opportunities to people who have internet access
  i would consider them as rich compared to whom i saw near the border , funds should
  be pooled in to create educational opportunities for the ones who cant afford .
  Lets make a world a better place for others . Lets not run behind money lets create
  difference to society
