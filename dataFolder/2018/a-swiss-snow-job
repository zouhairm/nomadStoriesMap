Text: "Wandering through Zermatt during last week\u2019s blizzard, I passed a small\
  \ souvenir shop. An elderly woman\u2019s voice called out from inside, \u201CCan\
  \ you help me?\u201D I saw her struggling to move a table out of the store on to\
  \ the snow-choked sidewalk, so I gave her a hand with it. Her name was Antoinette.\
  \ I accepted her thanks and walked off \u2013 good deed for the day done.\n\n\u201C\
  Wait!\u201D the shopkeeper called after me. \u201CIf you have a little time, could\
  \ you help move the snow?\u201D I declined, explaining in broken German that I needed\
  \ to meet my family. Besides, every able-bodied resident seemed to be employed in\
  \ some form of municipal snow removal that morning. Surely, she would be able to\
  \ get help from the lawful authorities.  But my conscience had been pricked. I had\
  \ visions of the poor old lady overwhelmed by a snowdrift. And with the ski lifts\
  \ closed, I had time. After explaining myself to my family, I hurried back to the\
  \ shop.\n\nAntoinette seemed unsurprised, handing me an odd tool, more like a small\
  \ ice-chopping wedge than a proper shovel.  I set to clearing the sidewalk in front\
  \ of her store, but she redirected me to the knee-deep snow piled up in the adjacent\
  \ alley. This new task seemed impossible with the equipment at hand. But I welcomed\
  \ the exercise. So I began chipping away at the bottom of the pile. \u201CNo!\u201D\
  \ the lady cried. \u201CYou must start at the top.\u201D She pointed up the alley\
  \ to a winding staircase leading to her apartment. When I threw excess snow under\
  \ the stairs, she objected again. All snow must be removed to the street.\n\nThe\
  \ resulting trench may not have been Swiss in its precision, but it met with grudging\
  \ acceptance from Antoinette.  I declined her offers of payment, but she insisted\
  \ so vehemently as to preclude my departure from the premises. Finally, I accepted\
  \ a couple of knit caps for my kids, and this seemed to clear a path for escape.\n\
  \n\u201CWait!\u201D Antoinette called out again. \u201CCan you go to the bank for\
  \ me?\u201D Of course, the idea was ridiculous\u2026 there was no way. I sat frozen\
  \ in my tracks, unable to articulate why the bank surely wouldn\u2019t allow me\
  \ to deal on her behalf, while she fumbled through her paperwork for about five\
  \ minutes. It came as a great relief that she simply wanted change for a 100-franc\
  \ bill. That I could do! Antoinette wrote my instructions out precisely, down to\
  \ each note and coin.\n\nThe teller at Credit Suisse met my request with businesslike\
  \ placidity, allowing himself only the hint of a knowing smile at the mention of\
  \ Antoinette\u2019s name."
