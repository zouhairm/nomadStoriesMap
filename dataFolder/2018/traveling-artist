Text: "It all began the year of 2016. What began, you ask? My creativity, my lust\
  \ for life. The will to not let life swallow me up whole. I wasn't ready to quit\
  \ my day job physically but I was ready mentally. In a way, because who's ever ready\
  \ to walk into the unknown. I knew I wasn't. A year had passed and I was still there.\
  \ What was I thinking? I needed to support my family, that's what. So I continued\
  \ with my painting everyday after work even on my weekends off. This whole art thing\
  \ started to consume me up until this day. Moving forward it's February of 2018\
  \ and I quit my job to further my education on art, visual art.\n\n  A traveling\
  \ artist isn't someone who travels the world and makes art or sells their art. I\
  \ travel the world through my mind, through my imagination. I traveled the world\
  \ back and forth with my thoughts over and over again on doing what's right. Nothing\
  \ feels right when you're a mother to three boys every decision you make leads back\
  \ to them. Every move, every climb, every mountain even the smallest hill can feel\
  \ the tallest. I have to share my world with them that's the hardest part in being\
  \ a traveling artist. Remember, I'm traveling in my head because reality is that\
  \ my life, my career isn't quite where it needs to be for someone my age. Not that\
  \ it's a bad thing because we all come from different upbringings and mine wasn't\
  \ wealth. I came from a single mother who did her best in raising her children and\
  \ I'll be thankful, forever. We didn't have very much but we had love yes, we had\
  \ that.  So with being considered low income people seem to struggle with the necessities\
  \ to survive that's where I come in well, my art. \n  \n  I started to make a local\
  \ connection with people outside of work before I quit. I joined a group called\
  \ Art Guild of Central Texas because at that point I couldn't afford in going to\
  \ school. I joined this group not realizing I was the youngest member. Being around\
  \ so many talented artist made me feel small but that didn't scare me away. I started\
  \ to learn more on how to paint this and how to do that. Here I am now making art\
  \ for people to help raise money for discipleship school as a donation. Yes, my\
  \ painting was a donation so that they could raffle it off. I did several for this\
  \ family.  What did I receive out of it? God's appreciation. It made my heart happy\
  \ that my art was traveling to different places, different homes, all for a good\
  \ cause. I started making art to help those less fortunate. To help those in need."
