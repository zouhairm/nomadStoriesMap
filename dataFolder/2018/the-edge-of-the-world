Text: "It was a great opportunity for me that I traveled  some places in India, Like\
  \ varanasi, Lucknow. I have been in varanasi for 2 month and it was a awesome moment\
  \ when i used to sit over the ghats of Ganges. I felt the peace there and got to\
  \ know the lots of customs and culture about the ancient India.it was a nice place\
  \ really. I was there with my friends and we did alot of things together there.\
  \ It was a great a choice that I made to visit varanasi. It is the city of lord\
  \ Shiva,\nthe most worshipped God in Hinduism. I saw that different people from\
  \ different places were there in varanasi, and it made me more fascinated about\
  \ varanasi's culture.\n                         And it was also a great opportunity\
  \ for me that i choosed Lucknow for my further studies after my highschool completion,\
  \ Lucknow is also known as the \"City of Nawabs\" that  means the city of richest\
  \ muslims. lucknow was known as Awadh in ancient times. I went there for my further\
  \ studies and I visited alot of historical and cultural places in Lucknow and i\
  \ got to lots of beauty and architecture by the nawabs (kings). I visited Imambara\
  \ it has a adorable infrastructure and architecture because it consists alot of\
  \ secrets in it. I visited Residency which was build by a British Person in the\
  \ colonial period of India, it was awesome. I visited Janeshwar mishra park of Lucknow\
  \ which is the largest park by area in Asia. It was also very adorable."
