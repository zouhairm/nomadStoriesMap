Text: "I stepped out of the hatchback rental and straight into a different time, post\
  \ WWII Italy to be exact. As I laid my eyes upon it, a house I\u2019d come to know\
  \ through stories and timeworn black and whites, I was overcome with a mix of emotions.\
  \ I\u2019d only ever been there in my imagination, yet as I stood there, thousands\
  \ of miles from home, I didn\u2019t necessarily feel out of place.  \nResiliency,\
  \ hard work and the importance of family were the consistent themes I remember of\
  \ our family\u2019s story. Unfortunately, many of my relatives had passed before\
  \ my time, so I often couldn\u2019t put a face to the name, or a meaning to the\
  \ sermons . \nMy father, the youngest of three brothers, left his home in Fano,\
  \ Italy, in 1951. His family like so many others after the war, extremely impoverished,\
  \ no prospects for the future, made the life altering decision to move to Canada.\
  \ \nMy father\u2019s older cousin, who lived in the house after his family left,\
  \ was there as our guide. Although I\u2019d never met her, she immediately treated\
  \ me like a son, taking my arm in hers, she escorted me around the property. As\
  \ she went on in Italian, too quick for me to keep up, I tried to imagine what this\
  \ place would have looked like back then.\nThe house looked much different then\
  \ the pictures I\u2019d seen, a second floor had been added, a child\u2019s playset\
  \ occupied the front garden and a metal fence now surrounded the yard. It was obvious\
  \ this place no longer represented the level of extreme poverty that it once did.\
  \  \nAs we continued walking, I began imagining the stories in my head, like a flashback\
  \ in a movie. I saw Buffalo Soldiers bathing in the river behind the house, German\
  \ Soldiers pillaging the garden for food and even my dad and uncles playing in the\
  \ yard. \nStanding there in the street, more of my new-found relatives continued\
  \ to arrive. I successfully executed more cheek kisses that day than I had in my\
  \ entire life. Hearing the stories I\u2019d heard so many times before from other\
  \ perspectives, I felt like a detective trying to connect the dots. \nSeeing the\
  \ house, the landscape, meeting the people, the raw human emotion, I had always\
  \ loved the idea of being part of an Italian family, but never truly knew what that\
  \ meant. \nAs we stood there preparing to leave, a single tear ran down my father\u2019\
  s cheek, I\u2019d only seen him cry once before. I rubbed his bald head like I had\
  \ so many times before, a genuine human connection I\u2019d never truly understood,\
  \ until that day."
