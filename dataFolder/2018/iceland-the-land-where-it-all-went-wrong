Text: "The morning of our second day in Iceland we completed driving the famed \u201C\
  Golden Circle.\u201D We were on the Southern Coast Road at Skogafoss, a beautiful\
  \ waterfall, when our wonderful vacation turned into a nightmare! \n \nThe spray\
  \ from the huge waterfall had coated the vast field of rocks with ice so I stayed\
  \ close to the river and walked carefully to get closer to the falls.  Suddenly\
  \ without any warning I slipped on ice and landed HARD on my right side.   After\
  \ realizing that I wasn't going to be getting up on my own, we flagged down two\
  \ burly tourists who carried me about one hundred yards back to our SUV.  My wife\
  \ drove forty-five minutes to the nearest medical clinic in the town of Vik.  The\
  \ doctor took one look at me and informed me that I had to get to the emergency\
  \ room in Reykjavik ASAP!  \n \nAbout two and \xBD hours later through a snowstorm\
  \ we pulled up at the hospital in Reykjavik. I was taken to the Emergency Room and\
  \ told the grim details.  I had broken my femur and required hip replacement surgery.\
  \  Our vacation was over.  My fall had ruined it.  No climbing and exploring ice\
  \ caves of Europe\u2019s largest glacier.  No seeing the Northern Lights.  No visiting\
  \ Glacier Bay and enjoying a nice Langoustine meal.  No other seafood or Icelandic\
  \ delicacy meals either.  Nothing now except surgery and a hospital stay.  However,\
  \ after the shock, numbness, anger and tears I realized had my femur bled I may\
  \ have died at the waterfall.   Had I hit the back of my head on that ice I also\
  \ would have likely died.   I was an emotional train-wreck constantly switching\
  \ from anger and frustration to gratitude.   \n \nI had full hip replacement surgery\
  \ the next afternoon.  When I awoke I noticed a blind spot in the vision of my right\
  \ eye.  According to the eye specialist I saw upon my return home, it is very likely\
  \ that there was a blood clot that occurred in the artery of the eye during surgery.\
  \  So besides gaining an artificial hip I lost 25% of the vision in the right eye.\n\
  \ \nAs I recover and learn to adjust to my new life I will put this horrible experience\
  \ behind me and return to Iceland to give my wife and I the awesome trip we deserve:\
  \  exploring the glaciers, enjoying the seafood and local delicacies, seeing the\
  \ Northern Lights, and letting the \u201CLand of Fire & Ice\u201D touch our hearts\
  \ and fill our souls with adventure and enjoyment replacing that harrowing nightmarish\
  \ near-death experience.  I will re-write this chapter in the story of my life the\
  \ way it should have been!"
