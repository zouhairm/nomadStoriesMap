Text: "The vast arrays of the spectacular hills around me filled me with fascination.\
  \ The boat I was travelling by over the river Godavari, surrounded by the huge Papi\
  \ hills, felt like heaven\u2019s gate. The place was a remote paradise, away from\
  \ the hustle and bustle of the city and far away from mobile network. The magnificent\
  \ lustre of the hills paired with the profound silence made the trip an enthralling\
  \ experience. The clear blue sky and the pure air added to the beauty of it. The\
  \ river twisted and turned between the hills, manifesting the sheer beauty of nature.\
  \ Even the government seemed enamoured by the river, hence they started constructing\
  \ a dam on it. \nLegend has it that these hills get their name from an evil king,\
  \ \u201CPapi\u201D, who stopped the flow of Godavari as it entered his kingdom.\
  \ When the seven holy sages requested him to let the river pass, he allowed it to\
  \ flow through a narrow space between the hills. Hence, the river is guarded on\
  \ both sides by the Papi hills. The majestic hills were shrouded by a carpet of\
  \ lush greenery. Occasionally, a tribal hut was visible among the vegetation. As\
  \ the boat kept going slowly, I felt like a tiny creature in front of the colossal\
  \ beauty surrounding me. \nWhen the boat reached a tribal habitation, I got down\
  \ and started climbing the jagged terrain. As I reached the huts, I was amazed to\
  \ see huge trees and shallow creeks. A group of old tribal women were selling wild\
  \ mangoes in hand woven baskets. A young tribal man stood under the shade of a tree,\
  \ with a small table in front of him. He stood silently, gazing into empty air.\
  \ I marvelled at the beauty of the shiny bamboo handicrafts on his table.\n\u201C\
  Did you make them?\u201D I enquired.\n\u201CMy mother and sister made them\u201D\
  , he replied with a smile.\n\u201CSince how long have you been doing this?\u201D\
  \ I continued.\n\u201CSince last year, that\u2019s when my father passed away\u201D\
  \ he answered. \u201CBut, I won\u2019t be selling these for   long\u201D. \n\u201C\
  Why not?\u201D I asked. \n\u201COnce the dam is constructed, all this area will\
  \ be submerged. We will lose our homes and livelihood\u201D he said slowly. \u201C\
  I should take up another occupation\u201D.\n A sly breeze made its way to us and\
  \ the leaves of the tree shook silently. The sky seemed to be darkened by clouds,\
  \ casting a gloomy pall over us. I turned back and looked at the sacred river, which\
  \ is called the life giver. It appeared to be vast, deep and unending, just like\
  \ its history. I climbed down to the edge and touched the water. The river felt\
  \ cold, but continued to flow silently and serenely."
