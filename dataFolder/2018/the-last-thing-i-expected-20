Text: "...was to have the most spiritual experience of my life with a Japanese meditation\
  \ master on my trip to Nepal.\nIt all started flying to Kathmandu with my partner\
  \ to visit the girl we are supporting via a NGO. It's a crowded, loud city covered\
  \ in dust. Motorbikes everywhere, ridden by whole families. Only the man wears the\
  \ helmet, and the woman with her sahri holds the children.\n\nNext stop was Lumbini,\
  \ Buddha's birthplace. We departed by bus early in the morning; we had 8 hours ahead\
  \ of us. On that same ride, we met a nice Japanese couple, he a 77-year-old meditation\
  \ master and his wife. We started chatting as both my partner and I train martial\
  \ arts and practise meditation. \nThe meditation master asked us a strange favour.\
  \ \u201CPlease come with me to Buddha\xB4s birthplace. We have a mission to clean\
  \ up the world and bring good energy.\u201D My partner and I looked at each other,\
  \ smiled and agreed. \nWe first had to walk up to the main entrance and then take\
  \ our shoes off to enter the birthplace. The stones on the floor were burning. We\
  \ were walking like lizards along the stone path right to the centre of the shrine,\
  \ where there was a huge Bodhi tree.\nThe master explained that he had purified\
  \ energy water in a tiny little bottle. And then he took out a pitch-black stone,\
  \ a stone from Sirius, as he said. He held it against the sun and the stone just\
  \ turned completely translucent. Then he asked us to hold our hands together, the\
  \ four of us and he recited the purpose of his mission: unifying Mount Fuji, the\
  \ Himalaya and Buddha\u2019s birthplace with a new energy field that will clean\
  \ up the bad karma and, like a dragon, will start expanding good vibrations.\nSending\
  \ the chi, energy from your heart centre. Taking a deep breath, going into that\
  \ peaceful state, deep inside, where nothing happens, just emptiness, this is centre\
  \ of ourselves, this is state of Buddha.\nWhen finishing the world had changed.\
  \ People around us had become quiet. There was a surrounding peacefulness that you\
  \ could breathe and almost touch. Everything seemed to have changed. A new, mindful\
  \ world had arisen.\n\nWe said goodbye and departed.\n\nIt\xB4s funny that in order\
  \ to find myself I had to travel all the way to the cradle of Buddha. For having\
  \ this spiritual awakening, the stars had to be aligned. So, I was lucky they were.\n\
  Traveling gives place to so many experiences. It opens horizons, the unexpected\
  \ happens. It\xB4s just life. Right there when departing to your adventure, you\
  \ never know what will happen next."
