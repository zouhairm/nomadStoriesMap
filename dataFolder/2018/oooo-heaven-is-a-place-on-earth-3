Text: "It turns out Eden does exist, and it's in Utah.\nAfter navigating our 36-foot\
  \ RV, Hopper, through rush-hour traffic in Los Angeles, parallel-parking that monstrosity\
  \ in the narrow alleys of San Diego, and surviving the 101 degree temperatures in\
  \ Nevada, our whole crew was feeling a bit like we were losing our minds. Halfway\
  \ through Utah on our journey to the Bonneville Salt Flats, it was agreed that we\
  \ needed to stop ASAP and find somewhere to cool down for a while. \nUtah did not\
  \ seem very promising for this mission. As we were driving, the land surrounding\
  \ us was like if a desert grew vertically into the sky. Just dry mountains and rock.\
  \ Luckily, our resourceful leader, Chelsea, had found a spot that looked like it\
  \ could provide some relief. She had pulled up her map on her smartphone, and just\
  \ looked for any blue spot. The blue dot closest to us was in a place called Mona.\n\
  My expectations were low. I was just happy to be heading somewhere to swim for a\
  \ bit and not be driving. When we approached the area that Google told us the blue\
  \ spot would be, I started to question Chelsea's map reading ability. We were driving\
  \ through a neighborhood in the valley of a mountain. A man was riding a horse down\
  \ the sidewalk, and clearly that was normal because exactly zero other people were\
  \ staring at him the way we were.\nWe turned onto a dirt road that seemed to be\
  \ going right through someone's field, and entered an archway of trees. We parked\
  \ on the side of this road in the shade, and hopped out to search for this oasis.\
  \ \nOn the other side of the trees, there it was. A pond in the valley, surrounded\
  \ by trees and bushes and cattails. Kids and adults were swinging from rope swings\
  \ that looked dangerously thin. (The deadline is up, so I can't finish, but that's\
  \ that. C'est la vie)."
