Text: "This is a story about Yugur\xB4s community. I\xB4m in the Su Nan Hotel, in\
  \ Sunan, China. A man with glasses called Kai, community leader and party member,\
  \ arrives with his friend - a white van\xB4s driver-  who is one of the leaders\
  \ too. Together they will take me to visit the grasslands, the pastures, the neo-nomadic\
  \ fields. And we are going to meet the sheep and the country. 9th June, 5:40 AM.\
  \ We met Du. He is a shepherd. The leaders talk to him about my project, and the\
  \ man invites us to enter his house. Du is worried. One of his sheep has left the\
  \ herd.  \"This doesn\xB4t happen often\", he tells me. \"An outsider must have\
  \ done it, here we are all good neighbors\". This things should not happen in this\
  \ lands. His daughter-in-law cooks for the guests. She barely talks, her attention\
  \ is on the guests breakfast: butter tea and some bread. Families like Du\xB4s travel\
  \ in search of new pastures because they need them for feeding and to raise their\
  \ sheep. Summer, autumn, winter, spring, the seasons guides the herd\xB4s path.\
  \ It\xB4s like paradise, each family escapes from winter looking for eternal summer,\
  \ to settle down with their animals in a warm place with pastures. \"In this place,\
  \ the men\xB4s job is herding the sheep. About women, they get up in the morning,\
  \ make breakfast, and take care of children. When I come back home at noon, my daughter-in-law\
  \ prepare the meal and when it\xB4s ready, we eat, have a rest, and at the afternoon\
  \ the men go out and get the sheep back. Before winter arrives, we feed the sheep\
  \ and lambs and move to the following places. This thing often occurs,\xBFDo you\
  \ know why we, herdsmen, can\xB4t leave this countryside? Because sheep can\xB4\
  t survive without our protection. Wolves could eat them, bears could eat them. And\
  \ even some sheep could get lost, just like it happened to me today. You have to\
  \ find the sheep and take them back to the herd. Otherwise they might run into another\
  \ family\xB4s sheepfold. If you don\xB4t take care properly they could run far away\
  \ and you might never find them back.\". However, this is the happiest moment to\
  \ live in the fields. Soon winter will come and these families will have to move\
  \ once again. The link between all this nomadic families are sheep. They reproduce\
  \ fastly and that helps to mantain the group\xB4s economy. But the animal means\
  \ not only food or a life style, it\xB4s also considered sacrifice, a ritual, a\
  \ trascendent idea. It\xB4s a symbol. In grasslands, each season operates like a\
  \ machine gear. And sheep are like movement force."
