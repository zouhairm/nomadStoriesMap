Text: "Returning from the arid Madagascan spiny desert, Antananarivo Airport\u2019\
  s hullabaloo clattered in my ears. My dust-reddened shoes and sand filled hair marked\
  \ me as a mal-adapted animal in the landscape of baggage reclamation and lino floors.\
  \ \n\nThrough the arrivals gateway plumes of taxi drivers bellowed a symphony of\
  \ languages. My first taste of the real world: a cacophony. My luggage filled with\
  \ data sticks and equipment was suddenly wrestled from me as a cascade of business\
  \ cards fountained into my pleading hands. I caught only one card and pliably I\
  \ was syphoned into a taxi.\n\nI gathered my thoughts in the half hour ride into\
  \ the city. What had just happened? Had I lost my mind? I had lost my bag! In losing\
  \ the bag, I had lost months of research. Now all I had was a little money and some\
  \ random business card. It had an address on it. Should I go there? I had no map,\
  \ I could miss my flight. Searching for the equipment could leave me stranded. Flying\
  \ away empty handed was even worse. \nWithout explanation, dropped on a curb-side\
  \ in Madagascar\u2019s capital I felt drunk on loneliness and unappreciative of\
  \ the loveliness of a city whose marginal places burst with greenery. On the busy\
  \ street a benevolent buzzing enveloped me. I understood the midland dialect poorly,\
  \ was I being offered food? Without anything else to do with my last money I bought\
  \ a bowl of stew. I asked for several spoons and hungry people joined me. \nThe\
  \ food brought the world into focus, blurred becoming individual sets of grins.\
  \ The sweet smell of Madagascan bread, of hot road and hotter bodies filled my nose,\
  \ stew filled my belly. \n\nEnjoying sticky bread in the shade of a crumbling colonial\
  \ palace, conspiratorially we decided to follow the address on the business card.\
  \ We piled into a van, yelling instructions to the driver. No one could really understand\
  \ my Malagasy countryside dialect, so a woman who had sold me a postcard took charge.\
  \ Directing us to a strange clean landscape. I saw on a veranda the familiar pile\
  \ of my things. The sun hung low in the sky as I embraced the gargantuan suitcase.\
  \ My new friend sternly told off the luggage-kidnapper, and bundled me to the airport.\
  \ \n\nShooting into the sunset above Antananarivo I reflected upon the unfailing\
  \ kindness of others. I had planned to spend the day napping in the airport. Instead\
  \ I had an impromptu adventure meeting the mischievous spirit of an ever-changing\
  \ city."
