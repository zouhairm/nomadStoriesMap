Text: "Peering out over a sea of white, Mountain tops jutting into the seemingly level\
  \ cloud wall like Glaciers in the ocean. Being that I have grown up in a small town\
  \ in Delaware, this experience is exhilarating. For the majority of my journey from\
  \ East to West, I was unable to gaze out my small aircraft window due to clouds\
  \ or darkness. After what felt like an eternity, my first glimpse of Alaska reminded\
  \ me of a favorite childhood movie, Jurassic Park. I was able to make this journey\
  \ possible because of a connection I made during my vacation to the Bahamas. Whilst\
  \ sitting at a bar, I struck up conversation with someone my age, leading to what\
  \ I consider to be one of my best friendships. Garrett and I had a lot in common\
  \ but when I realized where he lived, I knew I would need to learn as much as possible.\
  \ I decided to visit him in June of 2017 in Anchorage, Alaska for the summer solstice.\
  \ Immediately, I was blown away by the beauty of this unfamiliar land. To help familiarize\
  \ me with the area, Garrett decided it would be best to head southeast along Seward\
  \ Highway and the Prince William Sound. For the first time in my life, I gazed upon\
  \ the most dramatic landscape I had ever seen. Each Mountain had snow dwindling\
  \ on its peaks. Leaning over to see the shear extent and height, I realized that\
  \ I\u2019m unable to see the summits because of cloud cover. As we pass Glacier\
  \ fed streams and rivers, I can\u2019t help but wonder how good the fishing is,\
  \ little did I know it was perfect timing for the first red Salmon run up the Russian\
  \ river. Though Garrett wasn\u2019t into fishing much, his lifelong friend Patrick\
  \ planned a two and a half hour drive south to Coopers Landing and I had just gotten\
  \ the invite. To be completely honest, I did not know what to expect. Before we\
  \ were able to fish, we had to make the long, two mile walk to Patrick\u2019s favorite\
  \ spot. As we first get onto the trail along the riverside, all you're able to hear\
  \ is rapids and seagulls. Being so far away from the road and parking, once someone\
  \ catches a fish they fillet it to lose extra weight, so the banks were just lined\
  \ with Salmon carcasses. Making our way farther in, the amplitude of locals amaze\
  \ me, each only five feet apart for hundreds of yards on either side of the river\
  \ it appeared full. I had never seen so many fisherman in one spot. It truly opened\
  \ my eyes to how much we depend on the environment even with today\u2019s society\
  \ and it makes me want to become proactive to protect anything I can in the future."
