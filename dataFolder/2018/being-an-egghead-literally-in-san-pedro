Text: "I never expected to get egged on Madonna's Isla Bonita. Yes, that\u2019s correct:\
  \ I had an egg on my head in San Pedro.\n\nMadonna\u2019s San Pedro is real. It\u2019\
  s on Ambergris Caye, Belize. Everyone drives a golf cart here. On the street, I\
  \ zigzag my way through in order not to bump into them. Or get bumped into by one.\
  \ I offer a ride to 2 Mexican brothers who work nearby. It pays better here, they\
  \ explain. They tell me to go to the carnival. I imagine parades, Carnival Queens\
  \ and dancing. It won\u2019t be like Rio, but maybe a mini Rio? It isn\u2019t, the\
  \ men say with a smile of conspiracy. \u201CWear old clothes; there\u2019s foam\
  \ and paint fights.\u201D I don\u2019t quite get it yet, but soon I will. \n\nOne\
  \ of them wants to show me his snake. Well, that seems inappropriate. The Mexican\
  \ says the snake keeps rats out of his garden. \"I put my sweaty shirt with him\
  \ tonight, he\u2019ll get used to my smell and won\u2019t harm me.\u201D He opens\
  \ a bucket and there it is, a big one. Luckily, he was genuine. Has he tried this\
  \ trick before? He shakes his head. We say goodbye and wish each other luck, with\
  \ the snake and the carnival.\n\nI prepare for carnival with other travellers: putting\
  \ on old clothes, downing a beer and buying paint. I don't want to be defenseless.\
  \ I\u2019m armored and ready. I examine the carnival battlefield: most people are\
  \ covered in paint already. The teenagers work in groups and declare war on each\
  \ other. Others are hanging out with friends: laughing and spraying. \n\nA guy in\
  \ my group politely sprays a bit of paint. The favor is quickly returned. Soon,\
  \ it\u2019s a big paint fight. There's paint in hair, eyes, mouths (a chalky taste),\
  \ but no-one cares. The game is on. With the first spray, the cold, wet feeling\
  \ surprises me. But once I get into it, I love it. Our supply lasts only five minutes.\
  \ By then, I'm blue. I can easily pass for a Smurf. \n\nMy hair is crusty of dried\
  \ paint. And somehow, slimy. I turn to see boys laughing with eggs in their hands.\
  \ I touch my hair again and feel the eggshell. I knew about the inclusion of eggs\
  \ in this party, but hoped to escape it. The boys look scared as I approach them,\
  \ but are daring enough to admit the attack. The boy holding the eggs is afraid\
  \ to give me one. I promise not to use it on him. He hands me one and ducks, just\
  \ to be sure. I simply turn to treat one of my new friends on an egg. \n\nFully\
  \ dressed, I take a shower. Intense washing and scrubbing still leaves me with paint\
  \ leftovers for days. As Madonna would(n't) sing: last night I got egged in San\
  \ Pedro."
