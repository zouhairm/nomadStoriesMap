Text: "\"Zion National Park! I live 'round there\", Jack-Willis, one of the Steiners,\
  \ tells me, frying up strips of bacon as the grease runs down into the sand. Jack\
  \ sports an Everglades T-Shirt, long ginger beard and sunglasses like The Dude of\
  \ Utah.\n\nI stir a mountain of hash browns, crack dozens of eggs. Monica, matriarch\
  \ of the Steiner clan, beams at me: \"I have eight daughters and five sons.\" All\
  \ of them Jacks, with nicknames. Most of them are present, plus wives, grandchildren.\
  \ Monthly reunion at Lake Powell.\n\nI heard of Lone Rock Campground two days ago.\
  \ A lake on the border of Arizona and Utah. Camping on the beach. A fine segue between\
  \ two hiking bouts.\n\nLeaving Grand Canyon that afternoon, night fell suddenly.\
  \ How far is Lake Powell, would it be full? I waved these questions off. I could\
  \ still sleep in the Hyundai. \n\nQuiet euphoria, as I passed the self-check-in\
  \ shortly afterwards. Turning off the motor, I sensed the invisible water. Stars\
  \ overhead and smoldering campfires. This is where my road trip truly began.\n\n\
  \"You're doing this journey all on your own?\" \n\nNorman Steiner and his wife Beverly\
  \ shone a light into my campground. Seeing my despair, Norman helped me set up my\
  \ tent with reassuring movements. He asked where I came from, and bid me join his\
  \ family for breakfast later.\n\nThe next morning reveals the rock, towering in\
  \ the middle of the waters. Soft rays color the canyons ochre. The strip is packed\
  \ with SUVs and RVs, buzzing of families.\n\nAs Jack and I prepare the breakfast\
  \ burritos, family members appear, lured by the smell. The sun burns on our picnic.\
  \ Multiple generations stir around me. There is a strong sense of communion, hospitality\
  \ and joie de vivre. I feel as though we all came here together. People keep asking\
  \ questions. Yeah, I say, I am going to California by car.\n\nThe Steiners hail\
  \ from Cedar City, Utah, yet some grandsons have lived in Rome or Cameroon. Jack-Willis\
  \ reminisces about Heidelberg, Germany: \"I have not been able to find one decent\
  \ burger, though!\" He gives me insights on Zion. I see Norman walking around, nodding\
  \ smiling approval.\n\nWe finish and I'm asked to join on a motor boat. We feel\
  \ the breeze on our faces. We take jumps from a rock. Someone snaps my picture as\
  \ I'm about to break the surface in a faithful plunge, promises to send a mail.\
  \ \n\nAs I gather my belongings, I am recharged for the road. I face the Lone Rock\
  \ one more time and turn the key in the ignition, the lamp Norman gifted me on the\
  \ driver's seat."
