Text: "On ill-defined paths I meander to a mound ~1/3 of the way up the Northern side\
  \ where I settle, watching birds fly rotational routes and breeze led water renew\
  \ itself indefinitely. The ripples lap light on the valleyside, but a servant to\
  \ otherwise total silence. A chill flicks my cheeks. \nA small building, \nbrown\
  \ amid looming\npeaks and muck-green\nlate summer shrubs.\nMany metre's\nonly semblance\n\
  of humanity.\nElsewhere, rorbuers of vivid yellow or crimson red hug fishvillage\
  \ fjordsides, overseeing commerce etc. Not here.\nAfter a half-hour and some shorts\
  \ from Borges\u2019 exquisite 'Labyrinths' I continue through odd marsh to see a\
  \ man stood outside the poem's scene; his hands motion rhythmically beneath the\
  \ doorway. A small switchblade in his left, a fish in the right, his downward swipes\
  \ rid the large catch of its scales. Some swirl in the lakewind and fall to momentary\
  \ peace. Others drop into a bucket.\n'Hi'\n\u2018Hello\u2019.\n\u2018Any trouble\
  \ with the neighbours recently?\u2019 and I smile to mask a mild wince.\n\u2018\
  They are quiet\u2019. \nI laugh and introduce myself. \nHis name is Per.  From behind\
  \ small spectacles he responds to comments on his seclusion, on its certain tranquil\
  \ simplicity.\n\u2018Not always so...\u2019 I throw a glance around at crisp air.\
  \ He notes my sarcasm - \u2018I know. Here now is peaceful. I fish and read, I see\
  \ some like you walk past til dark then I cook and sleep. The villages and trails\
  \ see tourism most. They need care. More feet means er..erosion\u2019 (enunciation\
  \ self-doubt) \u2018some summer days I see many out enjoying the cliffs, sure, and\
  \ the fish too, but when they take off their boots they do not care any more about\
  \ \xC5 or Reine they care for how it looks in their photos\u2019.\nThe camera in\
  \ my backpack. An ironic, agreeing nod.\nHe puts the fish aside half-done and walks\
  \ in; for a second I wonder if that is it. Wondrous Scandinavian Brevity. He returns,\
  \ a black sack slack from his scaley hand, filled with plastic and garbage discarded\
  \ in the past month. In July he filled three. No wince mask now. My stomach drops,\
  \ as do his eyes. \nI linger for longer than is socially sound. Knowingly, he asks\
  \ about coffee and we sit on low chairs by his doorway, discussing nations, wildlife,\
  \ literature, the admirable, perilous provision of free tuition (Per used to be\
  \ an academic in Troms\xF8. His close-crop hair: fading to grey. His infectious\
  \ intrigue: not so). From the lake\u2019s depths creeps dusk to meet us. I shake\
  \ his hand strongly and apologise for delaying his dinner. \n\u2018Great to meet\
  \ you, Per\u2019."
