Text: "I went to visit a friend of mine in Bologna. I had my fair warning about the\
  \ differences between the cold and efficient north of Italy, and the lazy, inefficient\
  \ south.\nWhen I get out of the train station, it was snowing violently. Not so\
  \ unexpected. Life goes on undisturbed when the snow falls in Bologna. Where I come\
  \ from, among the hills in the south of Rome, there\u2019s panic in the streets\
  \ whenever a single snowflake hits the ground. \nAnyway, I did all the activities\
  \ you usually do when visiting an old Italian city: you go around the little and\
  \ crowded streets, smelling mouth-watering smells coming from the restaurants. Then,\
  \ you eat whatever your nose had smelled, of course after the longest of times you\
  \ must wait to find a cramped seat in any of those restaurants.\nAfter that, to\
  \ make peace with the guilty part of you saying you need to burn all the mortadella\
  \ you put in your body, it comes the time to find a suitable high tower to climb\
  \ after lunch. Lucky me, there were The Two Towers of Bologna. I climbed almost\
  \ all the 48 meters of the Torre della Garrisenda, spreading myself against the\
  \ walls of the narrow stony passage to make room whenever a flow of successful climbers\
  \ was flowing down from the top. Then, again not so unexpectedly, a sea of red roofs\
  \ presented itself to me like a carpet. Far in the distance, the San Luca Sanctuary\
  \ on top of Colle della Guardia was painted in white. I listened to a guide telling\
  \ the story of a poor fellow accidentally thrown out of the tower by the big bell\
  \ pending from the center. I looked at the 97 meters of the Torre degli Asinelli,\
  \ thinking of the long line of people I saw waiting for the chance to climb it,\
  \ and I promised myself I\u2019m going to face the highest tower in the city next\
  \ time.\nWhat I didn\u2019t know at the time, it\u2019s that I was in the middle\
  \ of the biggest snowing in the recent Italian history. The snow was everywhere,\
  \ but most importantly in Rome. And when It snows in Rome, all of Italy freezes\
  \ and stops to watch. So, if a travel is also made by the return (and I firmly believe\
  \ it), the last thing I expected was to find more snow back at home than what I\
  \ found in the far and cold north of Italy.\nThat\u2019s how I found myself stuck\
  \ on a train in the middle of nowhere for five hours. Because when it snows in Rome,\
  \ all of Italy stops, but not only to watch in amazement. The main train station\
  \ in Rome was frozen and inaccessible like a proverbial snow globe made of glass."
