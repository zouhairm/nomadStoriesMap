Text: "The purple Mini-Cooper would not start anymore. Housing fell through in the\
  \ most wonderful town in California\u2014Carmel-By-The-Sea. My bags were packed\
  \ and I did not know why. I junked my car for a measly three hundred dollars and\
  \ bought a one way flight to Scotland. Would I be traveling for one month or two\
  \ years, perhaps forever? I was unsure, but that was the joy of it all. Age twenty\
  \ nine, and not a fear in mind, off I went. I landed in the place of \u201CIce-And-Fire\u201D\
  \ as they call it, and a grungy hostel welcomed me nicely. I meandered around Edinburgh\
  \ like a bird looking for their final nest, however, I knew this would not be the\
  \ end. Somehow my heart was drawn, it had a specific place in mind, a specific family\
  \ that would become my future. \n         One e-mail slipped from my fingertips\
  \ to the keyboard to the screen to Sigr\xFAn\u2019s inbox (pronounced Sig-uh-roons).\
  \ She had offered me to live on her farm in the majestic North of Iceland and to\
  \ be their live in, child-caretaker. I said yes. I felt no limitations, no bounds,\
  \ no responsibilities holding me back paralleled with an unquenchable longing to\
  \ meet something or someone there. I had no idea how that or they would transform\
  \ my life, my dreams, my heart, my womb.\n         So there I was, now caring for\
  \ four children, laughing, dancing, carelessly free. Six other children meandered\
  \ through the house as she birthed ten. The father was a shepherd and he did a sort\
  \ of dance in the field as he corralled the fluffy, white beauties, day after day.\
  \ The children watched from the window yelling \u201CH\xE6 Pabbi, H\xE6 Pabbi!\u201D\
  \ Their joy was infectious. My second day there, a gentleman walked through the\
  \ barn door and we locked eyes and hands and had an incomparable, immediate understanding\
  \ of one another. We were married three months later. Thirteen months after, our\
  \ sweet baby girl \xCDsabella greeted us. Now we are all nestled in a cozy flat\
  \ in Reykjav\xEDk Iceland as the children I came to watch stayed in the North. They\
  \ are now my nieces and nephews. Simply divine. This city is moving, bustling, the\
  \ buildings run yellow, blue, red, orange, green. The creativity streams through\
  \ the wind and all about this place. It feels quite exotic. This is all because\
  \ my Mini-Cooper broke down and I could not be happier."
