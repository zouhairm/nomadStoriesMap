Text: "Mid year, 2004.\n\nA 23 year old hotel concierge spends yet another morning\
  \ dutifully completing his tasks, blissfully unaware of the bigger picture around\
  \ him.\n\nI had never set foot out in the world. In fact, I had grown in a tiny\
  \ country town, and only moved to the 'big City' (Melbourne), the year before.\n\
  So to fathom that a random chance meeting that day would spark a new life inside\
  \ me, taking me to new and faraway lands, was incomprehensible.\n\nMidway through\
  \ the day, I had a chance encounter with a member of a visiting hotel delegation.\
  \ She hailed from Vietnam, a country I knew of like most, as a war, not a nation.\n\
  We start talking, and I begin to absorb information of this fantastic sounding strange\
  \ land, and it lit a fire inside me. I had to see it. \n\nI booked tickets for a\
  \ week in Ho Chi Minh City, and left.\nIt was a marvelous adventure, and I was absolutely\
  \ at awe at this spectacular city and country. The sights, the sounds, the culture.\n\
  \nBack home in Melbourne again (I bet you didn't expect me to cut off the details\
  \ so soon), I return to my work. Physically, but not mentally.\nFor you see, my\
  \ thoughts, and indeed those of my heart, were not ready to be there, to be 'home'.\
  \ They remained in Vietnam.\nThus, I gave my resignation, and 6 weeks later, return\
  \ to Vietnam on a one-way ticket, where my true adventure, and chance encounter\
  \ with my new local connection began.\n\nI wander into one of the several department\
  \ stores that line the inner streets of Ho Chi Minh City, and proceed to search\
  \ through some clothes.\nApproached by the slightly timid yet friendly sales girl,\
  \ Ni, she offered my all the help one could possibly need as I tried countless items,\
  \ swapped life stories, and began a yet to be known friendship.\n\nShe was a simple\
  \ girl, poor, yet liked to laugh, and she offered to show me some sights after closing\
  \ time.\nNi introduced me to ca phe sua da, a sweet white Vietnamese iced coffee,\
  \ to small backstreet restaurants, and to her friends.\nShe allowed me to absorb\
  \ experiences during the next few months I stayed, that only a local can know.\n\
  \nWithout the length of space to detail or adventures here, I can merely attempt\
  \ to emphasise the importance of our friendship with details of its longevity; that\
  \ I have returned to Vietnam on 14 occasions since then to visit, attend her Wedding,\
  \ and to become the godfather of her son.\n\nLater this year we will return again,\
  \ 'we' being my family, where she will meet my own Son, and I see my forever Friend,\
  \ from afar."
