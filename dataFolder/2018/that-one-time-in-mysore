Text: "With the desire to deepen my yoga practice, I traveled to Mysore, India, known\
  \ as the \u201CAshtanga Yoga Capital\u201D of the world. My morning routine here\
  \ involved a challenging 90-minute yoga practice, followed by a shower, and then\
  \ breakfast at a cafe.\n\nOne morning I was walking to Khushi\u2019s Cafe to meet\
  \ up with fellow yogis for breakfast. Along the way, a 15-year old boy dressed in\
  \ a religious outfit began to follow me. Based on his outfit, he looked like he\
  \ was part of the temple opening celebration. He started a conversation with me.\n\
  \nBoy: \"What\u2019s your name?\u201D\nMe: \u201CAnkur.\u201D\nBoy: \u201CYour beard\
  \ is looking sexy.\u201D\n\nStrange wording, I thought, but I accepted the compliment.\
  \ He kept walking along with me silently, pondering something. Then, he then began\
  \ to ask more questions.\n\nBoy: \u201CHow old are you?\u201D\nMe: \u201C34.\u201D\
  \_\nBoy:  \u201CAre you married?\u201D\nMe: \u201CNo\u2026\u201D\nBoy: \u201CWhy\
  \ not?\u201D\nMe: (pausing) \u201CUh, because I haven\u2019t found \u2018the one\u2019\
  \ yet?\u201D\nBoy: \u201CDo you like girls?\u201D\n\nWas he wondering if I might\
  \ be gay because I\u2019m 34 and single?\n\nMe: \u201CYes, I like girls.\u201D\n\
  Boy: \u201CDo you know John?\u201D\nMe: \u201CNo\u2026\u201D\nBoy: \u201CJohn let\
  \ me touch his penis.\u201D\n\nWhoa! I became concerned, wondering if John was an\
  \ adult who sexually abused this teenage boy.\n\nMe: \u201CDid you want to touch\
  \ John\u2019s (1)  penis?\u201D\nBoy: \u201CYes.\u201D\nMe: \u201COh\u2026\u201D\
  \n\nAs I was processing this, the boy\u2019s gaze went from my face to my crotch.\
  \ I started to feel awkward, and he continued with his questions:\n\nBoy: \u201C\
  Can I touch your penis?\u201D\nMe: (surprised) \u201CNo!!!\u201D\nBoy: \u201CPlease!\u201D\
  \nMe: \u201CNo way, you can\u2019t say \u2018please'!\u201D\nBoy: \u201CNo, we won\u2019\
  t do it here, somewhere else we will do.\u201D\nMe: \u201CBye!\u201D\n\nLuckily,\
  \ by this point, I was in front of Khushi\u2019s Cafe, so I scrambled in, and he\
  \ didn\u2019t follow. He yelled \u201CPlease!\u201D a few more times, but I didn\u2019\
  t look back. He gave up and moved on.\n\nI quietly sat down at the table with my\
  \ friends. A new feeling began to arise - I felt weird. I was surprised that I had\
  \ just been sexually propositioned by a young boy. One of my friends noticed that\
  \ I seemed off, and she asked what was wrong. I told her about the incident, and\
  \ all the women at the table smiled as they said, \u201CNow you know how it feels!\u201D\
  \ It felt like, \u201CWelcome to the club!\u201D\n\nSo this is how it feels. I expected\
  \ to leave Mysore only as a more experience yoga practitioner, but I also left with\
  \ the memory of this incident, knowing many women experience numerous such incidents\
  \ throughout their lives.\n\n--\n* I have changed the name for safety reasons, since\
  \ being gay is illegal in India."
