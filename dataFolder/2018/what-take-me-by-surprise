Text: "Finally we arrived at our accommodation and all the stress we had accumulated\
  \ during the day began to release. I definitely needed a beer, however it was impossible\
  \ to find one there. The journey to Fez felt as if a whole week had passed since\
  \ we left Rabat at midday. \nRamadan had been a surprise, we hadn\u2019t known when\
  \ it would be celebrated when our trip was planned. At the Rabat station, hundreds\
  \ of people were waiting on the platform in the hot sun. I was thirsty but I was\
  \ afraid of the murderous looks for drinking water in the middle of fasting people.\
  \ The next train was headed to Fez therefore we needed to take it. \nWhen the train\
  \ arrived no one got off, in addition, people on the platform started to press on\
  \ the exits trying to get inside. The train was extremely full, my only possibility\
  \ was to run from one entrance to another listening to people\xB4s complains and\
  \ yells until we figured out that was impossible to get inside. We watched it leave\
  \ with shock, worry, and yet also a comic impression. I couldn't believe what my\
  \ eyes had seen! I have never seen anything similar before\u2026 the train left\
  \ with some people holding on the edges of the windows!\nSome guys, who were also\
  \ unable to take the train, took one look at our stunned faces and explained \u201C\
  this is Ramadan\u201D. Apparently it was the first weekend of Ramadan, and people\
  \ were moving to their villages to spend the weekend with their relatives. Perfect!\
  \ We should choose the best time for travel by train!\nAn hour and a half later\
  \ another train arrived. By then I was mentally prepared to jump onto it. I still\
  \ don't know how but we did it! We were inside standing in the middle of the aisle,\
  \ surrounded by quiet people who all looked tired like us. As the closer we were\
  \ getting to nightfall the more talkative people were getting, the countdown to\
  \ dinner was on! \nOur arrival at Fez station was just 10 minutes before sundown\
  \ and 10 minutes before Ramadan dinner. There were few taxis left and people were\
  \ running to them like a sales morning. People were nervous, excited and starving\
  \ as I tried to haggle a taxi, and the driver threatened to leave us unless we accepted\
  \ his price. Out of options, I felt ripped off for a brief moment before my life\
  \ went before my eyes!  In what felt like a second, we covered 4.5 km! In reality\
  \ it could not have been more than 3 minutes in the cab. \nThe travel started with\
  \ this chaotic anecdote and thanks to the unexpected Ramadan, we received a wondrous\
  \ culture experience!"
