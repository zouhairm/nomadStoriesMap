Text: "\u201CI am a Njie.\u201D\n\nWe should have reached the deeply remote village\
  \ of Ker Auldi just after noon. Sitting north, central of the River Gambia, we had\
  \ been on the road for most of the morning, a change from the overcrowded ferryboat\
  \ from the Gambian capital of Banjul to Barra. \n\nFor most visiting the \u201C\
  smiling coast\u201D, Ker Auldi is not on the bucket list. The journey was filled\
  \ with the hustle of traders, with goods and livestock, and passengers commuting\
  \ on the ferry, followed by the stifling heat of a mini-bus to a small place no-one\
  \ has heard of. With 71 kilometres of serene beaches, where the heat is remedied\
  \ by the crisp water of a fresh coconut and the glistening waves that beckon you\
  \ to join them, it\u2019s a wonder why anyone would choose this destination. But\
  \ I did. \n\nI am unsure of how to feel. The anticipation of this day, once a source\
  \ of energetic excitement, now nauseated me. Droplets fall down my face. Tears?\
  \ Sweat? Probably both. From the cooler I reach for a Vimto, take a sip and place\
  \ the icy glass bottle to my forehead. Better? Kind of. Along the red dirt road\
  \ I notice the intersection of paths, from feet, from hooves, from cars. All intertwining\
  \ but sticking to their own trails.\n\nFinally, I made it to the place where my\
  \ grandfather, Samba Njie, was born and had lived before meeting my grandmother\
  \ and emigrating to the UK. The place where he called home.\n\nStepping off the\
  \ bus the brightness of the high sun touched everything. I prefer the comfort of\
  \ a shadow, out of the harsh spotlight, where I can camouflage myself. Against the\
  \ backdrop of humble mud huts with thatched grass roofs a small crowd gather to\
  \ greet those offloading. Of those gathering, a young woman advances towards me\
  \ with a beaming smile. \n\n\u201CNa nga d\xE9f!\u201D She welcomes me in Wollof.\n\
  \n\u201CJerejef!\u201D I thank her, embarrassed by the betrayal of my western accent\
  \ in my reply.\n\nAs I follow her around the corner, I can hear the rhythm of the\
  \ sabor drum. Women dressed in brightly patterned wraps of vibrant greens and regal\
  \ purples are singing, clapping and dancing. They tell a story but the foreigner\
  \ in me cannot understand. \n\nThe 37 degree heat forces me to seek refuge under\
  \ the shade of a Baobab tree. The stillness alerts me of my heartbeat. The excited\
  \ screams of children get closer, they are eager to meet the toubab. In the place\
  \ I wanted most to belong, I am reminded that I am a stranger. \n\nIt all becomes\
  \ overwhelming and I suddenly realised I failed to answer. \n\nShe repeats, \u201C\
  I am a Njie.\u201D"
