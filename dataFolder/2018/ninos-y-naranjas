Text: "We sat at La Celestina, a bar in Coyoac\xE1n, and drank $1.50 Coronas to wait\
  \ out the day's rainfall. Child street vendors paced the cobbled alley, selling\
  \ sweet and spicy tamarindo candy to me, Jason and Ruiluz while we watched lightning\
  \ bathe M\xE9xico City in an ephemeral glow. Rain fell almost every day from May\
  \ to September.\n\nKilling the beers, we joked about ordering a whole bottle of\
  \ the (50% alcohol) house mezcal. Our server brought a pile of orange slices and\
  \ tamarindo powder and poured the first drink.\n\nI swirled the glass, taking in\
  \ the spirit's potent, earthy aroma.\n\n\u201CCheers!\u201D\n\nThe golden syrup\
  \ flowed down my throat, burning mellow and smoky, warming my insides as the rain\
  \ cooled my skin. We laughed after every shot, not truly appreciating mezcal\u2019\
  s complexity. We sucked on citrus to dull the burn.\n\nMezcal is like tequila, but\
  \ until the late 20th century it was rather unknown outside M\xE9xico. It's centuries\
  \ old, distilled from the heart of the maguey plant and infused with life force.\
  \ Historically mezcal was a poor man's drink. Now, it's produced like craft beer\
  \ or specialty wine.\n\nThe bar became a beacon in the night, pulsing with music.\
  \ Light ebbed into the damp street, shimmering off the corner of cobblestones.\n\
  We were halfway into the bottle when a tiny voice came from my side. A small girl\
  \ looked up at me with wide eyes. Her face was dirty, hair messy. She spoke, pointed\
  \ at our table.\n\nI raised my eyebrows at my friends. \u201CWhat did she say?\u201D\
  \n\n\u201CShe wants an orange,\u201D Jason translated.\n\nOh, the orange slices!\
  \ Of course. I offered her the fruit and she plucked a few slices.\n\n\u201CGracias,\u201D\
  \ she squeaked, and ran off.\n\nMinutes later, a group of children led by the wide-eyed\
  \ girl huddled around us asking for oranges.\n\nShe told her friends we\u2019re\
  \ giving away food, Ruiluz explained.\n\nShe chided the kids in Spanish; the kids\
  \ laughed and spoke with sparkling playfulness. But while their speech was bright,\
  \ their eyes were dark. My heart hurt for these kids. I knew they lived in poverty,\
  \ with over 20 million other Mexican children. But they were resilient, a trait\
  \ they distilled from deep within. Ruiluz sent them away without oranges.\n\nLater,\
  \ I saw the kids stomping in puddles, scattering when a car crawled by. Eventually\
  \ they disappeared, the rain stopped, our mezcal ran dry and we left, but I didn\u2019\
  t notice when. After I left M\xE9xico I learned the saying, \"Para todo mal, mezcal,\
  \ y para todo bien, tambi\xE9n.\"\n \nFor everything bad, mezcal, and for everything\
  \ good, too."
