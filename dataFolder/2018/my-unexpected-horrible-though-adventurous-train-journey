Text: "I Nikita Jain,22 in age , an engineering student suddenly made a plan of going\
  \ home from her college city Jodhpur, Rajasthan to Kota, her home on the festival\
  \ of Holi.\n\nMedha Purohit ,22 in age her college friend from the same city , Kota.\n\
  \n She asked me , Niks let's  go . I asked where?\nShe said \"Kota\" and laughed.\n\
  I said are you mad Medh \"how is it possible now\"?\nThen she smiled and nodded\
  \ I have a plan ..I asked with excitement tell .. she elaborate me the idea of going\
  \ home with nothing in hand .As we both are fond of travelling.\n\nI said allright\
  \ and said yes we are going and rest leave on god. At that time we used to have\
  \ little pocket money and so much to do.\n\nOur plan starts before a day of festival,\
  \ we took a bus of college in morning 5:00 a.m and went to city Jodhpur  and asked\
  \ the bus driver to drop us at station. First he said \"No\" ,we both don't understand\
  \ why he is behaving like this , then we convinced him anyhow that took our time.\n\
  \nAnd we ran to our train in hurry as train was going to depart .We saw entire station\
  \ was crowded with people . Whole train was full of people and people are hanging\
  \ to the doors even .\n\nWe decided we will take ticket of general class later on\
  \ the next station and jump into the train and searched the place to sit from the\
  \ tons of people .Anyhow we got a place , a single seat and we both sat on it .\n\
  \nAs the next station came , we asked to the next person behind us \"bhaiya for\
  \ how much time train will stop here\" \nBhaiya with a mature voice \" 20minutes\"\
  \ .\n\nWe decided ok 20mins are enough for taking ticket and eating something. So\
  \ we put 100 -100bucks in our picket before the station.\n\nAs the station came\
  \ , we jump out of the train with keeping our bags there only so that our seat will\
  \ be reserved.\n\nAfter getting outside , we saw there is long line on ticket counter\
  \ , we saw the train it was there only .we get into the lines thinking of train\
  \ will be here for 20mins .\n\nAs after 10mins we heard a horn of train ,we saw\
  \ back and train was leaving the station .We ran together to the train and waved\
  \ hand to stop the train , pull the chain we shouted .No one was putting attention\
  \ to us and train left the station. People from the train was laughing seeing us\
  \ running behind the train .\n\nStation master with stuck in his hand was also ran\
  \ behind us that what this both girls are doing , why they are running like this.\n\
  \nThen he took us to station office where a senior station master was sitting .He\
  \ looked us with a angry face"
