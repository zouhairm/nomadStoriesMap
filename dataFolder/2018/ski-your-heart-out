Text: "Light, pure, memorising.\n\nIt was the most beautiful thing to wake up to in\
  \ the early hours of eight am. I sat comfortably on the window sill looking up at\
  \ the still sky, watching each snowflake fall. So slowly, almost as if played in\
  \ slow motion. There was not an inch that was not covered by the white flakes. Silence.\
  \ They fell without letting a single soul know about their arrival, unlike the rain\
  \ who made sure everyone was aware. No, they were gentle. \n\nThat day we went skiing,\
  \ up high into the mountains of Aronsbakken. The sun was shining brightly yet the\
  \ crisp, cold air lingered. I looked around and saw families, friends, young and\
  \ old alike all dressed in their gear ready to face the mountains. I never done\
  \ this before I had never gone skiing in my life. All eighteen years never had I\
  \ ever stepped onto a snowboard or all-round skis. It was terrifying although I\
  \ liked the feeling of trying something new. It was time for me to get out of my\
  \ own comfort zone and begin to live life.\n\nI had instructors assist me and show\
  \ me how to properly ski. I felt like a child again, learning how to ride a bicycle\
  \ for the first time. It was hard, it didn\u2019t always work but in the end I somehow\
  \ managed to stay on my feet. Attempt after attempt, endless trying and sweat I\
  \ had finally managed to do it. I stood on the smallest mountain top, alone. Children,\
  \ adults, teenagers all passed me flawlessly making their way down. I stood, like\
  \ a puppet without its strings, helpless on the top of the mountain.\n\nInhale.\
  \ Exhale. Inhale. Exhale. Before I knew it I was down at the very bottom where I\
  \ started surrounded by locals, instructors and my best friend. They all cheered\
  \ and clapped for me. I felt relieved and proud of myself. I wasn\u2019t proud of\
  \ myself for many things but being able to do this made me feel good. The experience\
  \ was unforgettable.\n\n\u201CYou did it!\u201D I had begun to feel confident in\
  \ myself.\n\nA country which gained independence and decided to make skiing their\
  \ most know quality knows how to live up to their standards. The mountains were\
  \ breath-taking. The snow at the peak was pure, natural and clean. I had never seen\
  \ such an incredible sight. I had only ever see ageless green land back home, but\
  \ here it was solely white. In a place where the people made me feel welcome and\
  \ as though a part of their own town I wondered how lucky I was."
