Text: "It was 2am as the sounds of snoring and partying filled the 16 bed dorm in\
  \ the backpackers hostel that was my current home. I wanted to be peacefully asleep\
  \ hours ago. I needed out of this place but I had no where to go, no job, so no\
  \ end in sight. This was the only place I could afford though until I found something\
  \ better. I loved meeting the international crowd but I felt miserable and stuck.\
  \ \nI had just moved to Australia solo on a working and holiday visa. I wanted an\
  \ Australian summer in a surf town which the laid back, hippy, beachy lifestyle\
  \ of Byron Bay sounded perfect. It was my intention to stay there 5 months and live\
  \ like the locals, really getting to know the area and people. However, after weeks\
  \ of living at the hostel, I couldn't find a job or a place to live. It seemed impossible\
  \ to connect with the people who were true locals here and not just tourists. I\
  \ had to get outside of the backpacker bubble. But I gave in and took a restaurant\
  \ job, and resigned to living in the hostel. I hated it but I had to pay the bills.\
  \ \nThen I met Jaxon. I was similar to other women in his life, trying hard to make\
  \ him laugh and smile. But all I got was the cold shoulder. His brother, on the\
  \ other hand, was easier to win over though. These 2 and 5 year old boys would be\
  \ my saving grace. I landed a job as their nanny, after continuing to scour the\
  \ local online job board. The dad was Australian and the mom part English part American.\
  \ They needed help as the dad was away most of the week on business. Their warm,\
  \ bright house was big, clean, stunning as it overlooked the forest, town, and beach.\
  \ The family was welcoming, peaceful, and open. The antithesis of the hostel. It\
  \ was also a live in position, so it solved all my dilemmas! \nI settled in quickly\
  \ to their daily routines helping with washing, meal prep, and child care. I was\
  \ able to see the inner workings of the family and really become a part of it. They\
  \ introduced me to their tight knit circle of families, whom supported each other\
  \ and planned events. I learned about the jobs people did, struggles, joys, and\
  \ their everyday life that was behind the scenes of the tourist area they lived\
  \ in. I even went surfing with one of the moms in the mornings, finding out where\
  \ and when the locals enjoyed this amazing place. \nI wept when I had to leave.\
  \ That is the bitter sweet part of this lifestyle; the amazing people meet are all\
  \ on different paths and you never know when they might cross again."
