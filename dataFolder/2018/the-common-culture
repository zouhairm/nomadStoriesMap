Text: "\u201CKamasutra!\u201D I dropped the mic on our \u2018culture debate\u2019\
  . While legends from the Tower of David and the Wailing Wall stood my Israeli pals\
  \ in good stead, my Ayurveda and the ubiquitous Yoga were winning.  Pleased, I shimmied\
  \ like the anise in my tea. Peals of laughter broke out at the mention of Vatsyayan\u2019\
  s oeuvre, in view of our population of 1.3 bn, mostly prudes!\nEvents from earlier\
  \ were drowning out now, like the sun. The ease with which Hampi, an austere historical\
  \ sanctuary, had segued to this hippie haven on the other side of the Tungabhadra,\
  \ was as impressive as the relics of the Vijayanagar empire themselves. The UNESCO\
  \ World Heritage site, of carmine soil and gargantuan boulders, was the perfect\
  \ setting for new friendships. And though the exquisite temples, redolent of a rich\
  \ past, did leave me and the girls from Jerusalem in awe, the anticlimactic encounter\
  \ with the natives, not so much!\n\u201CThis is India, not America! You shameless\
  \ girls wear short clothes and then blame our boys!\u201D bellowed a man, from the\
  \ group by the store where we stopped for water. We had steered clear of the locals\
  \ all day and remained on peripheries, regretting our sartorial choice of shorts\
  \ and tees the moment we saw the signboard at the Virupaksha temple, \u2018BARE\
  \ SHOULDERS, SHORT SKIRTS NOT ALLOWED\u2019. It was clearly not for the priests\
  \ clad only in dhotis!\n I turned to the girls, embarrassed. But their demeanor\
  \ suggested they had been there before. Plopped awkwardly into the rickety basket\
  \ boats, we squatted our way back to our present retreat.\nAll smiles and banter\
  \ now, I brought up the bad taste left by my people. Admittedly, as a nation, we\
  \ had been resting on our laurels. But they stopped me right there. Surprisingly,\
  \ the girls, I learnt, were all active protestors at the annual SlutWalk in Tel\
  \ Aviv!  I was reminded of the candle march after the heinous Nirbhaya rape case.\
  \ And just like that, we had now begun to connect over our personal accounts of\
  \ slut shaming and sexism, at all the places we had traveled to. Even America! \
  \ Oh, the irony!\nIt started pouring. Was that petrichor, or Mother Earth, chiming\
  \ in? The sky was now a blueprint for Van Gogh\u2019s \u2018The Starry Night\u2019\
  . Chatting feverishly, like the sheep in the pastures beneath, chomping fervently\
  \ in excess to chew the cud later, a year after the trip I still find strength in\
  \ our conversations from the night. Set out to soak in some culture at Hampi, bonding\
  \ with foreigners over rape culture, was the last thing I expected."
