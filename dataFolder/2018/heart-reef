Text: "The last thing I expected on my last trip to Australia was that this experience\
  \ changed something in me forever, in my person for always.\n\nTravel always enriches,\
  \ but I did not imagine that it would change so much as not to be the same again.\n\
  \nI didn\u2019t travel to forget anyone (any great love) or to reflect, or because\
  \ there was a limit situation in my life that shouted at me: escape! \n\nI didn\u2019\
  t travel to escape anything.\n\nI traveled alone and I think that was the secret\
  \ of the success of my trip.\n\nThere should not be a reason to put land in the\
  \ middle. You just have to travel to enjoy. \n\nYou have to travel to learn, try\
  \ new flavors, smell new smells ... to be more tolerant, to be aware of what you\
  \ have.\n\nYou have to travel with the smile on, without masks, loving yourself\
  \ and trusting yourself. \n\nI think that for a trip to change your life forever\
  \ you have to be brave, you have to take trains without hesitation, if you make\
  \ a mistake, get off and change platforms.\n\nFor me, traveling is daydreaming.\
  \ \n\nIt is getting excited and confusing reality with possibly being asleep in\
  \ the room of your house. It is giving you a pinch to know if it is a dream or reality\
  \ what you are living. \n\nI have pinched myself several times in my life and hopefully\
  \ I pinched many more.\n\n\nTraveling is incomparable with anything else in the\
  \ world. Who travels, lives more than one life, like when you read or watch movies\
  \ but the difference with them is that when you travel you are the protagonist.\n\
  \nThe only thing we have all in life, rich and poor is TIME. It's the same for everyone,\
  \ so I want to spend it traveling. \n\nWhen I traveled to Australia I experienced\
  \ situations that surpassed any film, documentary or even Microsoft wallpapers that\
  \ I had seen before. I explain the anecdote of the image gallery of Microsoft computers.\n\
  \nI had never seen the Great Barrier Reef from the air before and the first time\
  \ I saw it was live and direct. In the middle of the Australian east coast, in a\
  \ city called Airlie Beach, the whimsical fate meant that a piece of the great Australian\
  \ coral reef had the shape of heart. And this famous image is among the Microsoft\
  \ gallery. \n\nThat night I posted the photo of the famous heart reef in my Instagram\
  \ gallery and numerous friends informed me that they had that image on their wallpaper\
  \ and that they thought it was unreal due to the beauty of it. OMG!! Wonderfull!!\
  \ \n\nAustralia changed me. I am the best version that I think I can be of myself.\
  \ \n\nI will be back"
