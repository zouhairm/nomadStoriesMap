Text: "The noise of the airport surrounded me & eveyrthing felt unreal. The memories\
  \ of the 10 days I'd just spent in Canada, while the temperatures kept getting warmer\
  \ & warmer, kept spiraling in my head as I walked towards my gate. I couldn't believe\
  \ this was already over ; I barely believed that it really even happened. It all\
  \ seemed like a fuzzy, beautiful dream from which I would need to get up any minute\
  \ from now. I didn't wanted to wake up. It all felt like an unfinished business,\
  \ as if I had missed on something that I couldn't name but without which I couldn't\
  \ move forward. Big cities, natural parks, cosy little neighborhoods, friends, family\
  \ - I had done everything I came there to do, & even more, but I still felt like\
  \ this wasn't over. It could not be finished. Not with me getting to my plane, exhausted,\
  \ still a bit drunk from the farewell party. A beautiful dream doesn't end like\
  \ this. There was something else out there for me to experience. There had to be.\
  \ Right?\n\nThe answer came to me in the form of a violent storm in Iceland, keeping\
  \ my plane from taking off on time. I waited at one of the charmless bar of the\
  \ airport, then finally got to my seat and took a sleeping pill to prevent my fear\
  \ of flying taking me over. So, I was actually leaving Canada. If I really had to\
  \ wake up from this dream, I'd rather it happened during my sleep.\n\nI woke up\
  \ in Iceland a few hours later, just after the sunrise. Last evening's storm was\
  \ over & had painted the landscapes with a pure, shiny snow. From the speakers of\
  \ the airport, I learned that my next plane got cancelled and that I would have\
  \ to wait 24 hours, alongside my fellow travellers, to get to Paris. The company\
  \ took us to a hotel nearby & left us there, with nothing to do. Some of us were\
  \ frustrated ; others were too tired to make any sense out of it. I was ecstatic.\
  \ \n\nLeaving my dreamy 10 days in Canada, I woke up in one of my actual dreams\
  \ : the magnificient and strange Iceland. I took a bus to Reykjavik. I wandered\
  \ its streets without knowing where to go. I smiled to everybody I ran accross,\
  \ I ate, I drank Viking beer. Then I took my bus to go back to the hotel, while\
  \ the sun was setting. As I walked in the snow back from the bus stop, I noticed,\
  \ tickling the skies, big, flashy Nothern Lights, dancing above my head. \n\nThe\
  \ blizzard was rising & everything around me was frozen ; still, I felt a warmth\
  \ pouring into my veins. Now, I could go back home light-hearted. I had found the\
  \ thing that was missing."
