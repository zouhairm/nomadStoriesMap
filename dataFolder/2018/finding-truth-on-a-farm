Text: "\u201CYes, let\u2019s go to Salem!\u201D I said. And that was the phrase which\
  \ started my spring holidays in the U.S. In fact, I was supposed to visit New-York\
  \ city. But there are three things that I can never do in my life: resist ice-cream,\
  \ get up right after the alarm instead of lying for another fifteen minutes. And\
  \ the third one \u2013  I can never say \u201Cno\u201D to my American friend Hannah.\
  \ That\u2019s why I cancelled my bus to New-York and went to Hannah\u2019s family\
  \ instead.\n\n \u201CSalem is a small town in West Virginia but you will love it\u201D\
  ! \u2013 Hannah talked loud to be heard above the deafening music. We already were\
  \ in a car on our way to her house. I then prepared myself for a \u201Csmaller-than-New-York-city\u201D\
  \ town. But what I saw was a few houses in the middle of a forest. It turned out\
  \ that my friend lived on a farm. Her family had 17 horses, 4 dogs, 2 pigs, 2 rabbits\
  \ and even a guinea pig. There also were deer constantly running through their yard.\
  \ \u201CA DEER!\u201D \u2013 I pointed excitedly every time I saw them, but apparently\
  \ Hannah\u2019s family didn\u2019t find them interesting.\n\nI only travelled to\
  \ big cities before and found no interest in travelling to small towns \u2013 I\
  \ just thought it would be boring. But the five days that I spent, as I called it\
  \ later - in the middle of nowhere \u2013 eventually became the most memorable time\
  \ of my life in the states. We rode horses, played with dogs, went fishing, cooked\
  \ a lot, helped Hannah\u2019s parents with the farm and rode horses again.\n\nI\
  \ live in the capital of Russia and I can admit that I am a big city person. I love\
  \ busy streets, people hurrying everywhere and I even love the city\u2019s noise.\
  \ I always thought that if a person was born in a small town, his goal is necessarily\
  \ to move to a bigger city. Living in a village always seemed as \u201Cunsuccessful\u201D\
  \ life to me.\n\nHowever, locals from that remote town Salem showed me that for\
  \ some people a life like that is a true happiness. They made me realize that everybody\
  \ has his own world view and priorities.  \n\nEveryone has his own truth. Therefore,\
  \ it\u2019s impossible to say who is right and who isn't. After that trip I understood\
  \ that I can\u2019t judge people only with my own truth and vision of the world.\
  \ I began to see the world through the eyes of its people and it helped me to find\
  \ calmness. Travelling makes us see the world through the eyes of its inhabitants\
  \ and to become more tolerant to the world.\n \nThe last thing I expected was that\
  \ small trip to affect my life values and views. But it did and I am so thankful\
  \ for it."
