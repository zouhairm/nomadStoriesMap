Text: "In July 2015 I took my first trip to Europe - 3 days in Lisbon (Lisboa) - with\
  \ my lover of the time. I know now he was unworthy of my attention but at the time\
  \ I was what would be called \u2018smitten\u2019. I flew in on a red-eye via Frankfurt,\
  \ landing in the sweaty Portuguese city early the next morning. In a cab, on the\
  \ way to my hotel, I watched modern streets morph into wide cobblestone roads filled\
  \ with trams, cabs, and tuk-tuks (motorized rickshaws) battling for prominence.\
  \ Arriving in Alfama, Lisboa\u2019s oldest district, that spreads southernly from\
  \ Castle of S\xE3o Jorge down to the River Tagus I was taken with views of the terracotta\
  \ roofs that blanket the city. Rich with history, Alfama boasts an abundance of\
  \ fado bars, an array of restaurants, and traditional family homes with small shops\
  \ on the lower level.\n\n\nMy first night in the city I stayed at Santiago De Alfama,\
  \ which had just opened but has since become one of Lisbon\u2019s 5-star boutique\
  \ accommodations. Situated on Rua de Santiago - a street known for being the start\
  \ of the Caminho de Santiago Compostela, and the street where Christopher Columbus\
  \ was married - the 15th century \u2018Palacio dos Castros\u2019 was an ideal place\
  \ to kick off my journey. \n\n\nThe next morning I joined my love in an Airbnb around\
  \ the corner, and the adventure began again as we wandered nearby streets, soaking\
  \ up local history, and admiring abundant urban art. We roamed the colourful streets\
  \ meeting locals who spoke of a catastrophe that had befallen the city. At first,\
  \ we thought the disaster recent, but as references piled up it became obvious it\
  \ was a historical event. \n\n\nThough earthquakes were common in early modern times,\
  \ on November 1, 1755, Lisbon suffered a devastating seismic event - destroying\
  \ the city, triggering a tsunami and fires, and killing close to 40,000 people.\
  \ The extreme losses still echo through the city like the melancholy of a fado.\n\
  \n\nOver next two days, we ventured further afoot - to Cascais for the beaches and\
  \ Belem to indulge in Pasteis de Belem, the OG embodiment of Portugal\u2019s famous\
  \ custard tarts - returning to Alfama for more delicious food, Portuguese wines,\
  \ and to explore the old city\u2019s nooks and crannies.\n\n\nAs our short stay\
  \ in Lisbon came to an end I had a feeling I wouldn\u2019t be coming back with this\
  \ man who\u2019d made my heartbeat scatter. I\u2019d thought travel would bring\
  \ us closer. Instead, I discovered just how far apart we were. I fell in love with\
  \ the city as I started to fall away from the man."
