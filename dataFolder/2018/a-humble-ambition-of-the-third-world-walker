Text: "A Friendlier Why: \nAs a nature/science freak and a guy who\u2019s rock star\
  \ is David Attenborough, I consider this scholarship a \u201Cdream-come-true\u201D\
  . \nWe are all seeking purpose on one level or another, and when even have a glimpse\
  \ what we really love or what matters \u2013 we reevaluate life and strive for the\
  \ true things. \nEven if it\u2019s just a couple of weeks, this trip could be a\
  \ life changing experience. Aside from that, it\u2019s a source for inspiration\
  \ that I could incorporate in poetry, music, theater and film as I\u2019m an artist.\
  \ \nFunny fact, when was involved in radio (back in Moldova), had a show based on\
  \ culture, and now the opportunity comes to actually experience something for real\
  \ and not just citing books. What\u2019s crucial here is, to actually make a change,\
  \ raise awareness and discuss issues openly. If I have ever gotten a chance, I would've\
  \ made sure to set an example and talk about important matters via my own voice\
  \ or my art. \nNature is what makes us - us, and Earth is our domain. Being unappreciative\
  \ and just receive what it gives us, - is a one sided relationship, that eventually\
  \ exhausts and empties the giver. \nIf we could find a way to give back, help, preserve\
  \ and document the beauty of this world \u2013 than we transcend from being just\
  \ a consumer or sensation seeker\u2026. \nHeading towards the most genuine, unconditional,\
  \ rewarding and true relationship we can have \u2013 the one with nature. \nNature\
  \ is us\u2026. \nand, we communicate via nature...\n\nA Little Louder:\nMy mission\
  \ as human being, immigrant and artist is to contribute to the world surrounding\
  \ us.  I grew up in a small town in Moldova; while living there was close to natural\
  \ world and felt I could change it for better. I promised myself I\u2019d travel\
  \ the globe and make it a better place. I was limited back then, as poverty and\
  \ Soviet regime were the obstacles. But even then I could find purpose in given\
  \ surroundings - lend a hand to farmers, work on the field, clean the parks. Now,\
  \ all grown up and living in NYC, I have to realize those dreams. Whether it\u2019\
  s helping animals, cleaning oceans or protecting forests \u2013 it serves the same\
  \ cause. I\u2019m obsessed with cultures and believe that we\u2019ll find more similarities\
  \ than differences. We\u2019re all human beings, trying to figure out why we\u2019\
  re here. Sometimes we forget we\u2019re a part of this world. We as \"a culture\"\
  \ must explore and contribute to the subjects that matter the most. The most adequate\
  \ language here is the art... The art of making a connection. \nTo be continued..."
