Text: "If you hear a foreigner share their experience attending a festival or other\
  \ traditional event in Bulgaria, you will know why our cultural heritage makes Bulgarians\
  \ so proud. I, too, have always been fascinated by the culture of my country and\
  \ how the lively nature of Bulgarians can turn every event into a celebration, creating\
  \ an atmosphere you cannot feel anywhere else.\nHowever, there are some such unique\
  \ traditions, that you can hardly expect to ever see anything similar elsewhere\
  \ around the world. This year one such Bulgarian event caught the attention of UNESCO\
  \ as having the potential to join its Intangible Cultural Heritage list.\nEvery\
  \ year on 6th January, Epiphany, people from all over Bulgaria gather in Kalofer\
  \ - a small town in the Balkan mountain, to attend an event known as the \u2018\
  Male Ice Horo Dance\u2019. This traditional Bulgarian dance, accompanied by bagpipes\
  \ and drums and performed by men only, is so exciting especially because of the\
  \ extraordinary place it occurs in - the ice cold water of river Tundzha.\nThis\
  \ year the unique atmosphere exceeded any of my expectations. It was a mixture of\
  \ biting cold air and burning passion of people, gathered to support the hundreds\
  \ of brave men, dancing, singing and waving Bulgarian flags in the freezing water.\
  \ Thousands of people, many wearing traditional Bulgarian folklore costumes, visited\
  \ Kalofer to witness the legendary tradition, performed to ensure the whole year\
  \ will be fruitful and prosperous.\nUnder the cheers of the crowd, the men in the\
  \ water fought over the Cross, blessed and thrown in the river by a priest. Then,\
  \ following the custom, they gave it to the youngest participant in the \u2018horo\u2019\
  , who, this year, was only a few months old, wearing his tiny folklore costume.\
  \ On coming out, the men would proudly tell the well-known legend of the tradition\
  \ - how the water of the river could purify their bodies from any disease and their\
  \ dance - assure rich yearly yield.\nSupposedly as a result of the international\
  \ attention, the town was much more crowded than expected, with people pushing each\
  \ other to get closer to the river and have at least a quick glance at the dancing\
  \ men. On some occasions spectators would accidentally fall into the cold water,\
  \ finding themselves without spare clothes, freezing and wet.\nFreezing or not,\
  \ the spectators around the river and the men, dancing in the water, continued to\
  \ sing traditional songs and cheer, showing the burning hot passion Bulgarian people\
  \ hold in their hearts."
