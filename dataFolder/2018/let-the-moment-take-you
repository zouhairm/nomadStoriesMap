Text: "Have you ever heard of the butterfly effect? The phenomena of making a split\
  \ second decision that will determine the unfolding of all future events. In these\
  \ moments, one must act before thinking, which is exactly what I did when I experienced\
  \ an unexpected day in Ton Sai Bay, Thailand. I had a one week break between summer\
  \ classes while studying in Chiang Mai, and had decided to spend it along the stunning\
  \ beaches in Krabi. In the middle of that week, my friend, Yamilex, and I sat in\
  \ our regular spot on the beach in front of our Resort. We were both engrossed in\
  \ books, when I decided to catch a quick glance at the unbelievable scenery in front\
  \ of us, before returning to my studies. Something caught my eye though, and held\
  \ my gaze longer than I was expecting. It was a local Thai and a Tarzan looking\
  \ backpacker who were carrying fire poi, something I had only seen in pictures,\
  \ so I became increasingly curious. I interrupted Yamilex\u2019s reading to point\
  \ out the two men to her, and added in a comment of how exciting it\u2019d be to\
  \ learn how to twirl fire. Yamilex was the type that loved adventure and never allowed\
  \ the moment to cease her, so of course, her eyes lit up as she uttered the words,\
  \ \u201Clet\u2019s run after them!\u201D Terrified by the idea of everyone on the\
  \ beach watching us run after these mysterious men, I tried to rationalize to Yamilex\
  \ why we shouldn\u2019t, but it was too late, she had jumped up and soon we were\
  \ running side by side down the beach after Tarzan and his Thai friend. By the time\
  \ we reached them, my heart was pounding, as Yamilex explained to them, my interest\
  \ in learning how to spin poi. They found our predicament humorous and invited us\
  \ to come back to Ton Sai Bay where the local Thai named Kope, was from. \nIt was\
  \ a fifteen minute hike through rocky terrain to get from Railay Beach to Ton Sai\
  \ Bay, and from there, we fell down the rabbit hole. We landed in a place where\
  \ kind and beautiful people spent their days rock climbing, slacklining, fire twirling\
  \ and telling entrancing and hilarious stories. We met a whole gang of people who\
  \ spent their time at a place called the \u201CViking Bar,\u201D which we walked\
  \ through walls of colorful paintings to get to. We spent the evening transfixed\
  \ by the talent of the circus-like jugglers, story tellers, and fellow travelers\
  \ and each moment filled my spirit more and more, until it overflowed into the night.\
  \ And to think, if I hadn\u2019t jumped up and ran down the beach with Yamilex,\
  \ none of this would have been possible."
