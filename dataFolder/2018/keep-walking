Text: "The strange encounters of the spiritual kind I have had during my solo travel\
  \ across India over the years.\n\nThe frail Jain Sadhvi I met while climbing the\
  \ countless steps to the Palitana mountain in Gujarat, a solitary, stooped figure\
  \ clad in billowing white, her peacock feather fan in her hands as she carefully\
  \ dusted each step before she stepped on it, to clear it off any insect or ant that\
  \ may be crawling on it. 'Chant Om Namo Arihantanam every night, and you will be\
  \ free from fear', she told me, smiling a wide smile with half the teeth missing.\n\
  \nThe gentle High Lama from Spiti, a Rinpoche, whose brown eyes crinkled and almost\
  \ disappeared into his cheeks as he smiled a child-like mischievous smile. He was\
  \ a Trulku \u2013 a reincarnated lama who had recognized and was reunited with his\
  \ chief disciples from an earlier life! He joked, he threw back his head and guffawed.\
  \ It looked like he did not have a care in the world!\n\nThe brilliant chemical\
  \ engineering graduate from a REC, who had taken Sanyas, while not yet thirty and\
  \ who roamed barefoot in the narrow alleys of Rishikesh, all his worldly possessions\
  \ bundled inside a small sling bag. The incredible gentleness in his face as he\
  \ fed a banana to a stray calf. \n\nThe Saadhvi in an orange sari standing with\
  \ folded hands, tears streaming from her closed eyes as she swayed gently to the\
  \ rhythm of the Ganga Arati in Rishikesh. Seldom have I seen such serenity in a\
  \ human face. \n\nThe fiery Fakir with matted hair at Ajmer Sharif Dargah, the one\
  \ who took one look and told me that I was very hot-headed and stubborn. The octogenarian\
  \ Sadhu who danced with the gay abandon of a child during the evening Arati at Pashupatinath,\
  \ and a bunch of other people, traversing the mystical path. \n\nThey were not exactly\
  \ monks who had sold their Ferraris, but ordinary people who chose to take the path\
  \ less traveled in search of something that had eluded them in the course of their\
  \ normal life. Some had their choices thrust upon them, while most of the others\
  \ had chosen to follow their own inner voice.\n\nThe paths they traversed were different,\
  \ but they all had one thing in common. They radiated a serenity and contentment\
  \ that I have rarely seen in other people. They all had two things in common; a\
  \ wandering, itinerant lifestyle and few material possessions.\nPerhaps that is\
  \ the secret of inner peace. \n! Keep Walking!"
