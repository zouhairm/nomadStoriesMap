Text: "She looked straight at me and spoke quickly. She was looking at me with such\
  \ excitement that for a few seconds, I believed that I could understand her. But\
  \ as I struggled to place more and more of her words, it hit me that this was not\
  \ a language I was able to comprehend. \n\n\u201CI am sorry. I don\u2019t know Hindi.\
  \ I am with them.\u201D I gestured to the rest of my class. \n\n\u201COh. Not Indian.\
  \ American.\u201D\n\nI rejoined the group, most of whom were trying to buy anklets\
  \ and bangles and other trinkets. My roommate tapped me on the shoulder. \"Did you\
  \ know her? Looked like a friend!\"\n\nI shifted uncomfortably. \"Um, no, not really.\"\
  \n\nMy interactions with the locals in Delhi followed this same pattern. Because\
  \ I shared the same brown skin other similar features, I was greeted as though I\
  \ was a long lost friend. But they soon would realize that I lacked the one of the\
  \ foundations of connecting to the community - the language. Growing up in America,\
  \ I never learned Hindi. I celebrated the classic Hindu holidays, but the language\
  \ had been lost over the generations of the diaspora. Through their migration, the\
  \ history of my past also faded. I had no idea what part of India my family was\
  \ from. I had know idea where my roots were. It never really affected me until I\
  \ started to see the disappointment with the people I was meeting in India. I wanted\
  \ to tell them that a part of me was from here, from this land. But I knew neither\
  \ the words or the place to tell them. \n\nJanamashtami soon came around, a Hindu\
  \ holiday celebrating the birth of the Hindu God Krishna. I had promised my mother\
  \ I would make it to temple. I broke off from my class, and called a rickshaw. The\
  \ driver pulled up in a shaky four-wheeled cart-like vehicle. \"Temple?\" I asked.\
  \ He nodded. \n\nThe rickshaw driver took me to temple, but to my surprise, he did\
  \ not leave when I got off. He parked his rickshaw, and got off as well. He gestured\
  \ towards the temple. We took our shoes off and pressed our foreheads down on the\
  \ muddy floor of the temple. We walked together to see the stone figures that represented\
  \ the Gods. I realized that this was the first time I was going through these rituals\
  \ without my family to guide me and tell me what to do. I looked at him and smiled,\
  \ and he smiled back, as we both collected our sacred threads and tied them on our\
  \ wrists. I had only spoken a word to him, and yet I felt connected. To him. To\
  \ my family. To my roots.\n\n I felt, for the first time since being there, that\
  \ I belonged."
