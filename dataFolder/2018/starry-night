Text: "In a time when ratings mean everything, how does an AirBnB with no reviews\
  \ whose host doesn\u2019t speak your native tongue become the most interesting homestay\
  \ of your life?\n\nI meet the host outside his building on Ave Rapp, a six-lane\
  \ boulevard lined with towering, verdant trees, just steps away from Jules Lavirotte\u2019\
  s flower-crested, mustard-faded Art Nouveau apartment complex. We exchange saluts\
  \ and enchant\xE9s, and I discover that, given his limited English, my two days\
  \ in Paris will be spent speaking French.\n\nHis name is Tof, short for Tofinho\
  \ and shorter for Christophe. He is the kin of Portuguese immigrants who came to\
  \ France for their work. A few months shy of 30, Tof is a Parisian Iberian, speaking\
  \ French and Portuguese natively and Spanish with ease. Though he limps slightly\
  \ due to back issues, he exudes swagger of a modern Jean-Paul Belmondo: charcoal\
  \ fedora on his head, cigarette behind his ear.\n\nLed through a cobblestone courtyard\
  \ to an aged oak doorway, I find myself in a snug, ground-floor apartment. His mother,\
  \ an evident sweetheart, emerges from the kitchen, greeting me with kisses on both\
  \ cheeks. She has prepared piri piri, a Portuguese roast chicken dish that fills\
  \ the air with waves of garlic, butter, and chilis. In walk two family friends,\
  \ fellow Portuguese expats who introduce themselves as Tof\u2019s mother had. The\
  \ husband lays a loaf-sized machine and a bag of tobacco on the dinner table. He\
  \ starts hand-rolling cigarettes, those which Tof would smoke that night.\n\nJoined\
  \ by his father, a docile man with a firm handshake, we sit for a feast: piri piri,\
  \ herb-crusted potatoes, charred greens, and a burgundy red. The group converses\
  \ in French, discussing the news as a 15-inch TV next to us shows CNN footage of\
  \ the atrocities occurring at Orlando\u2019s Pulse Nightclub. The table asks my\
  \ thoughts on the senseless violence, gun control in America, and the then-ongoing\
  \ US election cycle.\n\nFollowing a memorable meal, Tof brings me two long metro\
  \ stops east to sleepless Blvd Saint-Michel, to move our hips to reggaeton with\
  \ maize-clad Colombians and yell Pura vida! as we watch a 3 AM f\xFAtbol match between\
  \ Costa Rica and Colombia.\n\nWe trudge out of the bar at sunrise, as sober as we\
  \ are exhausted. We cross the Seine to \xCEle de la Cit\xE9, enjoying cotton candy-pink\
  \ clouds that grace a pale blue sky. Holding hands with a Colombiana, Tof lights\
  \ a cigarette with the other as we approach Notre Dame.\n\nHow to quantify such\
  \ an evening? Sometimes, five stars isn\u2019t enough."
