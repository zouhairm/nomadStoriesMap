Text: "How do you describe a rugged medieval city built surrounded by the Sibilini\
  \ mountains, one of the most rugged wildernesses in Europe?  With gorges so deep\
  \ around its boarders that it is impossible to scale its size.  Thousands of years\
  \ ago, Roman armies used this city's giant stone fortress walls, handcrafted by\
  \ the soldiers who protected its riches.  The salt trades from the Adriatic Sea\
  \ brought countless riches as a tax haven.  With its incredible defenses compared\
  \ with that of Fort Knox today. \n Standing by the Roman bridges surrounding the\
  \ city, beginning to walk down medieval cobble stone streets, one realizes they\
  \ are walking among ancient stone buildings with beautiful wooden doors, adorn with\
  \ detailed stone trims telling a story of its past.  With twists and turns of the\
  \ old roads and alley ways, listening to the pigeons purring and footsteps echoing\
  \ off the buildings which seem to grow taller with each turn.  With the cracks in\
  \ walls and vines ruling the untouched spaces over delicate stones. \n        One\
  \ can imagine the people who roamed the streets from Roman times to the present;\
  \ occasionally catching a glimpse of a native with their dark hair, green eyes and\
  \ rugged yet handsome features.  Perhaps one could imagine such a person in a Roman\
  \ soldier\u2019s uniform wielding a sword, or a white silk dress with gold leaves\
  \ crowning their lengthy hair.  Unable to escape the feeling of having stepped back\
  \ in time, while entering into a caf\xE9 with its double barreled, jacked vaulted\
  \ arches on a downhill road, leading to the heart of the city.  \n Walking towards\
  \ Piazza Arengo, the smell of stuffed fried olives, lures you towards what used\
  \ to be the main meeting place of the medieval residence.  In the center stands\
  \ two large fountains with horses from the sea, pouring water from their mouths.\
  \  The water is supplied from old Roman aquifers from the surrounding mountains.\
  \  It is believed by locals that drinking water from the horses mouths would bring\
  \ good fortune and good health, making the drinker pure at heart.  On one end of\
  \ the piazza lies one of the great stone cathedrals of the city, Santa Egidio, with\
  \ giant stone columns and vaulted ceiling helping to support its giant bell tour,\
  \ rang by my grandfather as a child. Since the time I have set foot into the city\
  \ of my forefathers, I go to sleep at night, dreaming of this magical jewel, and\
  \ when I wake, the first thought on my mind in its name of greatness, Ascoli Piceno,\
  \ Ascoli Piceno, Ascoli Piceno."
