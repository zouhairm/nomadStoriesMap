Text: "It was a night with a lot of pending college projects to do, when my neighbour\
  \ room hostel mates decided to go to a temple. As i was living in Delhi the capital\
  \ of India it was a 14 hours journey with the train .It was a 3 day trip which includes\
  \ 2 day travelling in the train. Our jouney started on 26 january the train timming\
  \ were 4:30 am  There was a thrill in every person as it was very far from our city\
  \ and we were going to explore the hill cilmate and culture . We all headed to old\
  \ Delhi Railway Station at 3:30 in the morning when we reached to the station we\
  \ found that our train has been delayed from 5 hours now the the timming were 9:30\
  \ we all waited in the platform itself that 5 hours of our trip was unexpected but\
  \ we managed meanwhile we took a lot photographs ate our breakfast walked through\
  \ the platform a number of time chit chatted about the college, it was 10'o clock\
  \ and we were in the train playing cards as we were tired we went for a sleep the\
  \ time flew like it was a dream we listened all time favourite songs of different\
  \ port as my friend was having jbl pulse 3 the sound quality was amazing . We reached\
  \ Katra a small town in Jammu at 12:30am the next day . As it was dark we were unfamiliar\
  \ with the view , we booked a auto (three wheeler scooter) for the main market were\
  \ our hotel was situated the most waited and interesting part was yet to come which\
  \ was 14 km hill walk to the temple named (vaishnu devi) . In the morning we had\
  \ to start our day early so we went to sleep instantly after having a light meal.\
  \ We woke at 7am freshend ourself ate our breakfast took the ticket for the temple\
  \ as there are serval points ahead were the ticket it checked for the confirmation\
  \ we started our hiking so called adventure sport to reach our destination at sharp\
  \ 9am with our backpack and of course our bluetooth speakers which was very helpful\
  \ . For first few km we were very excited our pace was very fast but everyone got\
  \ losen up . While we were on our way we found a man playing dhol (musical instrument)\
  \ we danced as if we were immortal with beats of the instrument. The view fasinated\
  \ us at every point the cold wind with sun energized our body, at 2 pm we reached\
  \ the temple we worshiped our \nGod after that we ate our lunch in a mini restaurant\
  \ situated up there. And started our journey back to the hotel my friend  increased\
  \ the volume of the speaker and  we enjoyed the moment as our small trip was going\
  \ to end soon."
