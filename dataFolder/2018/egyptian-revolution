Text: "It was December 2010 and my parents had just returned to their country of birth;\
  \ Egypt. They needed a holiday and they wanted to see family and friends that they\
  \ hadn\u2019t seen in years. Each day I would call them to make sure they were ok\
  \ and to see if they needed anything as well as reassuring them that my sister,\
  \ her kids and I were ok.\nThe days and weeks went on like clockwork; little did\
  \ I know that something was brewing in their part of the world. Something that was\
  \ going to make history and something that would change the course of Egypt, it\u2019\
  s people and its future. \nMy parents were hinting to me that something was brewing\
  \ and that there were talks of really intense protests that were underway. I told\
  \ them it was nothing new and I brushed it off as I did with most protests I heard\
  \ had taken place in the past. \nHowever, this protest was a political one, a historic\
  \ one and one that would erupt in ways I could never have predicted. \nBack home\
  \ in Australia; news of the protests in Egypt had broken and initially I dismissed\
  \ it was something that would last a couple of days and then die down as always.\
  \ I tried calling my parents to see if they were ok; unfortunately I couldn\u2019\
  t reach them. \nAs the days continued; word that a revolution was taking place and\
  \ the images on TV were really disturbing. I eventually contacted my parents but\
  \ they were describing horrific scenes of looting and violence and they were advised\
  \ to stay in doors. \nI began to understand the idea behind the revolution; but\
  \ there were also people taking advantage of the situation. I decided at that point\
  \ in that moment to go and book a flight out the same day and go to both check on\
  \ my parents and see for myself what the revolution was about.\nUpon arriving in\
  \ Cairo I knew I had barely two hours to reach the border of Alexandria where my\
  \ parents were before the curfew would come into affect. I had friends help me get\
  \ from A to B all whilst being shot at and being stuck in vans that had women and\
  \ men hiding weapons; not to create havoc with but to protect their homes. I got\
  \ to my parents and made sure they were safe. Then I felt a purpose to join the\
  \ Egyptian revolution and be part of history. Being in Tahrir Square I saw hope\
  \ but I also saw grief as I held a stranger in my arms who was shot. I saw Christian\u2019\
  s and Muslim\u2019s unite with a common goal. There\u2019s a lot more to this story\
  \ but my decision to come to Egypt and be part of history pushed me to the edge.\
  \ I dealt with death, hope & despair."
