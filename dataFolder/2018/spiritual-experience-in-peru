Text: "I was leaving with two friends and headed to South America. I had the responsibility\
  \ of the choice. And, when I chose Peru, I did not know I was entering a spiritual\
  \ experience. \nFirst thing I remember when we landed in Lima was the smell, full\
  \ sea odor and smog. From Lima ourplan was going down south and after towards lake\
  \ Titicaca and Puno, then to Cuzco, and Machu Picchu of course, to Lima again. I\
  \ chose Peru for my overwhelming love for the mountains. I would have never imagined\
  \ mountains were Apus for Peruvian. Apus? Yes, spirits of the mountains. Each mountain,\
  \ each peak in fact, has the name of its Apu. \nSo, from Lima on we experienced\
  \ the beautiful landscape of Peru as every other traveler. We met the boisterous\
  \ and foggy Pacific Ocean, the desert in Paracas, the Nazca lines and were amazed\
  \ by the mountains when we first saw them in Arequipa, la ciudad blanca. We were\
  \ astounded when we crossed the Andes to reach Puno on the lake Titicaca and visited\
  \ villages there. \nBut it was in Cuzco that we finally met Laura. We had never\
  \ met before. Laura was born in Cuzco and always lived there. She\u2019s not tall\
  \ and got long dark hair in a plait. Along her life path she met Queros and with\
  \ her we gave a kick to our real true Peruvian experience. \nQueros inherited and\
  \ preserved the ancient cultural and spiritual tradition of the Incas. They live\
  \ on the mountains, at the feet of the Andean glaciers. They live in harmony with\
  \ nature and their rites to honor Pacha Mama, Mother Earth, are among the most powerful\
  \ in the Andean cosmology. \nSo, this is where Laura comes from and she tried to\
  \ teach us the most of it. Not far from Cuzco stand three of the most important\
  \ archeological sites of the Inca empire: Sacsayhuam\xE1n, Tambomachay and Puca\
  \ Pucara. Well, what we did was visiting the sites not with the eyes of the common\
  \ tourist but opening our hearts to spirituality, in ancient places that were temples\
  \ dedicated to water, and animals. We strolled down paths unknown to tourists, among\
  \ huge ancient rocks and entered the womb of Pacha Mama in the most amazing caves.\
  \ We learnt to see and read symbols and to listen to our most hidden selves. \n\
  Laura gave us the keys to read Andean spirituality and Peru. We were able to see\
  \ it everywhere afterwards. All had a meaning, all have a meaning. What I brought\
  \ home is this intense way to live spirituality and the connection with our Mother\
  \ Earth in everyday life and now know that in old Europe too, all the mountains\
  \ have their Apus."
