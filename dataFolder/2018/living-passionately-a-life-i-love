Text: "At what point in our lives do we really make a pause to think on what really\
  \ moves us? That happened to me a couple of months ago and although I can not promise\
  \ you that the road will be simple, I can assure you that the reward of knowing\
  \ that you are out there in the world doing what you really love ... is surpassing.\n\
  \nMexico City, February 28, 2015\nAs a foreshadowing of what was coming in my life,\
  \ my arrival in the capital was involved from turbulence on the plane to the loss\
  \ of my luggage by the airline; however, there I was with all the inner strength\
  \ that can accompany you when you are about to start the biggest professional challenge\
  \ of your career, and for which you had been working all these years. But how different\
  \ the capital looked to my old city! Veracruz, as Agust\xEDn Lara would sing it,\
  \ vibrates in your being even when you are far away, its palm trees, its beautiful\
  \ sunsets, its silver moon, the always friendly smile of its people, even its rudeness\
  \ (because only among \u201Cjarochos\u201D, that\u2019s how they call people from\
  \ Veracruz, we know that it is a way to speak with affection).\n\nAs a good daughter\
  \ of a traditional Mexican family, I tried to play correctly the role of a woman\
  \ who studies her career, knows the love of her life, gets married, has children\
  \ and completely forgets her professional fulfillment. I believe that no one has\
  \ the absolute truth about the role we should play in today's society and I firmly\
  \ believe that we have enough freedom to choose for ourselves the path we want to\
  \ follow and put our forces in it.  - Miss, we have arrived at the destination that\
  \ you indicated to me - interrupting my liberal thoughts commented the driver.\n\
