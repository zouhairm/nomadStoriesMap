Text: "A ghostly wailing pierced through the heavy rain. \n\nEmanating like ribbons\
  \ of smoke, from somewhere within the maw of forest.\n\nFrom beneath my shelter\
  \ I searched for Gordie\u2019s face, hidden beneath the bow of his lean-to. We exchanged\
  \ a worried glance. His eyes, illuminated only by the beacon produced by his headlamp,\
  \ appeared animalistic under the glaze of precipitation.\n \nIn the wilderness,\
  \ amidst a vacant stretch between villages on the Isle of Skye, I shook violently\
  \ against the cold. I was swaddled within the wet confines of drenched clothing\
  \ and a child-sized sleeping bag. I had never been so completely out of my element,\
  \ or so truly vulnerable in my entire life.\n\nEarlier that day I\u2019d built a\
  \ shelter out of the sodden timber that lay all about the underbrush. I\u2019d taken\
  \ care to ensure the roof was thatched thickly with branches and moss. Though it\
  \ did little to dissuade the roaring, voracious weather that the night brought.\
  \ \n\nI was nearing the end of my travels and the prospect of having to return home\
  \ occupied my thoughts dreadfully. The journey had healed me in many ways. Exposure\
  \ to the beauty of the world remedied years of stagnation of mental damage. Quite\
  \ simply, I'd been given a reason to live.\n\nMy mind drifted to the events of the\
  \ days previous. Sitting between Tom and Gordie in the front seat of their van,\
  \ we had taken in the splendid majesty of the lush Faerie kingdom of Scotland together.\
  \ Hunting for treasures and precious stones on the banks of Loch Lomond. Or trekking\
  \ up Old Man Storr, buffetted by face-peeling winds and rushing sleet. Tom\u2019\
  s bad jokes filled the absence of radio.\n\nThrough the experience of hitchhiking\
  \ I had learned the value of being in a state of vulnerability in which I had to\
  \ be submissive to help from others. The purity and selflessness of kindness that\
  \ I was shown acted as a powerful medicine for my gravely ailing mind. Though in\
  \ the company of strangers, I felt overwhelmingly safe. A powerful juxtaposition\
  \ against the challenging atmosphere. I felt a warmth from the gratuitous thoughts\
  \ ease my discomfort.\n\nThe ethereal wails took on a lulling quality and I fell\
  \ asleep.\n\nIn the morning, Tom awoke me with a cup of hot tea.\n\nAs I headed\
  \ out from the bush towards the van I realized that something miraculous had happened\
  \ that night. Stepping onto the grass and away from the Faerie circle, I thought\
  \ that the very least of miracles that had occurred during my travels could be attributed\
  \ to the mysterious Banshee wails."
