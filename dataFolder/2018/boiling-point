Text: "With the ground nearly boiling below us, Trinidad and I laughed for what felt\
  \ like hours. Rain kept coming, sunrise was nowhere to be seen and I\u2019d finally\
  \ gotten some peace.\n\nI travelled to the town of Guayabal in southwest Mexico\
  \ as assistant director for a documentary on the struggle of its inhabitants, mostly\
  \ indigenous Zoques, to get their home back 35 years after the Chich\xF3n volcano\
  \ had buried it under debris. With my own traumatic experience just months behind\u2013\
  last year\u2019s Mexico City earthquake, which froze the megalopolis for weeks while\
  \ we hoped for survivors to be rescued\u2013, I was eager to lose myself in my work.\
  \ \n\nRom\xE1n, one of the townspeople, told us his \u201982 story: dragging his\
  \ dad under the ashen sky, losing his sister for an agonizing day, coughing and\
  \ gasping for a week. Amazed, we listened on our lunch break in the excavation site,\
  \ on a hill formed by the ashes. The volcanic heat didn\u2019t let the people of\
  \ Guayabal return for years, and by then they lacked money and time. Our movie was\
  \ their ticket back: half the budget would pay their day\u2019s wages while they\
  \ dug up their home. 10 year-old \xC1ngel tagged along on our 4 a.m. trips to the\
  \ digging site, with bottles of the maize and chocolate drink pozol to aid the weary.\n\
  \nWe took our protagonist, Guayabal\u2019s poet Trinidad, into the volcano. I conquered\
  \ most of my vertigo going down that dizzying slope, into the semi-active crater\u2019\
  s netherworld: a huge green lake, jagged slopes, and a zone of fumes and rock where\
  \ we got our best shots. Trinidad moved around like it wasn\u2019t a big deal. Everyone\
  \ else stumbled around.\n\nThe stress of the shoot piled up, and came to a head\
  \ in the crater. Trinidad kept a smile on his face. At night we shared a tent, and\
  \ while I ruminated on the next day\u2019s scenes, everyone\u2019s safety, just\
  \ how we could shoot a film in three weeks, the dark and fog\u2026Trinidad whistled\
  \ and yawned. I asked how he managed:\n\u201CI mean, you live next to a volcano\
  \ and want to get closer\u2013\u201D \n\u201CWhy worry? I\u2019ve been all around,\
  \ and I always end up coming back.\u201D \nSome nervous laughter. Then I kept laughing,\
  \ making dumb jokes and falling asleep lighter than ever. The volcanic soil kept\
  \ getting hotter, but it\u2019d all be alright somehow.\n\nBack in Mexico City,\
  \ the monster that could shake its 26 million people with an earthquake any day\u2013\
  and my home\u2013, I think of Trinidad\u2019s words. The Chich\xF3n is a monster\
  \ too, one that gives fertile soil and can turn it to ash. And it\u2019s their home.\
  \ Feels like a piece of home to me too."
