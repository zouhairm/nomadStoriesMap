Text: "2017 was a crazy year both personally and professionally. It was a year of\
  \ disappointments and hitting rock bottoms, a year of questioning myself and my\
  \ existence more than ever. I got meagre appraisal at work and it was even disastrous\
  \ for my travels; I got my family trip to Singapore cancelled at the last moment\
  \ as my travel agent turned out to be a fraud, my Visa to Europe got rejected and\
  \ many other local plans that never saw the light of the day. Overall, it was just\
  \ becoming the worst year of my life. \nSo, when my birthday came in October, I\
  \ had no plans for it whatsoever. My best friend asked me to pay him a visit to\
  \ Mumbai for a much-needed break. Even after multiple refusals, he booked my tickets.\
  \ I got my tickets one day prior to flying and was shocked when the destination\
  \ said Chennai and not Mumbai. I tried to clarify but he just wouldn\u2019t give\
  \ away anything. Next morning, at the airport, while boarding I was surprised to\
  \ see my 2 other friends who apparently were coming on this \u201Ctrip\u201D that\
  \ I was the only one unaware about. We met him at the airport and then rented a\
  \ car. It was not until we sat in the car and I was asked to put on the GPS that\
  \ I realized that the destination was \u2013 Pondicherry. I was elated. It was on\
  \ the Top 5 places that I had wished to visit in India. \n\nOur 3-hour long drive\
  \ along the Bay of Bengal was truly phenomenal. The best thing about driving in\
  \ South India is that you are always welcomed by clear skies and beautiful roads\
  \ surrounded by lush greenery that is such a lovely change from the concrete jungle\
  \ I live in. The Promenade beach offered us magical sunrises at the backdrop of\
  \ endless seas. The wind in my hair, the mild rays on my face, sand on my feet and\
  \ the sound of the waves. Priceless! We went to Auroville to soak in the good energy\
  \ and positive vibes. We gorged on the scrumptious delicacies of South India \u2013\
  \ my favorite being Sambhar and Rice. The yellow buildings at French Town with a\
  \ dash of bougainvillea here and there was a treat for the eyes. One can just never\
  \ get enough of the place. The trip was amazing, but the highlight was undoubtedly\
  \ \u2013 Surfing, which has been on my bucket list since forever and to tick it\
  \ off on my birthday just made it extra special. I am a hydrophobic, so it was a\
  \ even a prouder moment. Pondicherry was way more beautiful than it looked in the\
  \ photos or as I had imagined. I would always be thankful to him for making it happen.\
  \ It was like a dream and I would love to come back soon."
