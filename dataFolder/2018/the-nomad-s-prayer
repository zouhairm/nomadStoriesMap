Text: "The Nomad\u2019s Prayer.\n\nPerched high above Promontory Ranch, at around\
  \ 7,000 feet in the Rocky Mountains is a rugged little outcrop, just perfect for\
  \ an old fashioned bath with a fire beneath it.  In winter, it peeps through the\
  \ ethereal blanket of snow and is a wonderful place of healing and silence that\
  \ I look forward to visiting whenever I\u2019m able to scratch my itchy, antipodean\
  \ feet.  \n\nIt was here, some years ago, that the last thing I expected to find\
  \ was a very sturdy, but empty eagle\u2019s nest.  As I rested and contemplated\
  \ the majesty of these birds, I found myself inspired to write a poem for travellers\
  \ far and wide, based upon the remarkable life I\u2019ve been so fortunate to have\
  \ led since being born in Africa many years ago\u2026  \n\n\u2018The Nomad\u2019\
  s Prayer\u2019  \n\nMay you soar with wild eagles and drift with desert sands,\n\
  As you find the hidden treasures of long lost lands.\nMay the sun be your guide\
  \ and the fair winds always blow,\nAs you traverse this untamed Earth and all its\
  \ unknown.\n\nMay the smiles of small children light your way,\nAnd the wells quench\
  \ your thirst in the heat of each day.\nMay the breeze from rugged mountains lighten\
  \ your load,\nAnd pine needles soften discarded roads.\n\nMay sunrise fill your\
  \ senses with wonder and awe,\nAnd the air that you breathe be bracing and pure.\n\
  May the thermals embrace you like a long lost friend,\nAnd your horizons be unlimited,\
  \ no beginning or end.\n\nMay the stars be your blankets and the moonshine your\
  \ warmth,\nAnd your journey be more than you could ever have thought.\nMay you awaken\
  \ each dawn to the oceans serenade,\nAnd close your smiling eyes amongst the friends\
  \ that you\u2019ve made.\n\nMay your wings unfurl gently and wherever you roam,\n\
  May the skies be your canvas and the colours your own.\nLike Pegasus take flight\
  \ but never fear being alone,\nBecause the place your heart chooses will always\
  \ be home."
