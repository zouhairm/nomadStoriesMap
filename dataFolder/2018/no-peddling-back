Text: "Had it not been for the slow onset of anxiety as the realisation of what I\
  \ had gotten myself into started to dawn; I would likely have begun to appreciate\
  \ the grandiose nature of the incredible landscape that I found myself peddling\
  \ through much sooner. Lush, green vegetation obscured the rapidly flowing river\
  \ many metres below. Early morning light began to pierce the canopies towering above\
  \ us illuminating the cobblestone-like, tyre-crunching, single lane track that we\
  \ were carefully navigating. The complete absence of any other individual since\
  \ we had departed that morning only further added to my trepidation, settled only\
  \ slightly by the meditative hum of the natural, untouched surrounds; a world away\
  \ from the overstimulating chaos that we had left behind in Kathmandu only days\
  \ prior.\n\nWe were twenty minutes into a circa two week cycling adventure along\
  \ the Annapurna Circuit in the Nepalese Himalayan Range. The man responsible for\
  \ talking me into this \u201Cdecision\u201D, Andrew (a seasoned cycle-tourist) was\
  \ quickly drawing away from me with apparent ease, much to my frustration and growing\
  \ apprehension.\nAs I quickly resorted to the lowest gear on my beat-up, rental\
  \ bike before ceasing momentum altogether and battling to stay upright under the\
  \ weight of my sleeping gear, camera equipment and a few rations to keep us energised\
  \ along the way; the likelihood of riding (or oven pushing) my bike over the 5400m\
  \ high Thorong La Pass (slightly higher than Everest Base Camp), seemed like an\
  \ increasingly unattainable feat.\n\nThe prevailing landscapes we encountered that\
  \ changed dramatically around each turn; the ramshackle shelters that we shared\
  \ with goats and assorted other stray animals to escape torrential downpours; the\
  \ elderly women who welcomed us into their homes as if we were their long-lost sons\
  \ with beaming smiles; the numerous, hair-raising footbridge crossings that had\
  \ me wanting to forget everything I\u2019d learnt in my structural engineering studies;\
  \ the countless serves of home cooked dal bhat that we were treated to at each subsequent\
  \ village we traversed. All these experiences, and countless others, served as ongoing\
  \ motivation and continual reminders of why turning back was never an option and\
  \ why pushing myself to the edge always provides the most rewarding and memorable\
  \ aspects of travel."
