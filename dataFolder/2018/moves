Text: "It was a Friday in August and I\u2019d spent the last two weeks in my empty\
  \ house after selling everything I owned and quitting my job of 8 years agonizing\
  \ over whether I had made the right decision. I\u2019d planned to move to Hawaii\
  \ but I was choking on the follow through. After 26 years of playing it safe, I\
  \ ached for adventure but paralyzed in fear. I made countless pros and cons lists,\
  \ I talked it over with every confidant, I prayed to God and drank 1000 cups of\
  \ chamomile tea. None of it was helping. I bought 3 plane tickets before I finally\
  \ made it to the airport. I was terrified. Terrified to fly, terrified to leave\
  \ everything I knew, terrified of the unknown and where it would take me. Terrified\
  \ to do it alone. I packed my bag one last time and walked towards my dreams with\
  \ shaking legs. I had to break it down so small I had to literally tell myself to\
  \ put one foot in front of the other just to walk onto that plane. I stepped forward\
  \ and forever changed my life. Greater than taking any risk or making any move,\
  \ I faced my fear. Fear is the blocker of everything we want but are afraid to go\
  \ after. We can make INCREDIBLE things happen, but so often we let fear get in the\
  \ way. Fear of failure, fear of money, fear of living outside of societal norms,\
  \ but believe me, if I can do it, so can you. I was the most fearful person I ever\
  \ knew but I allowed my desires and my courage to be greater. I didn\u2019t let\
  \ the fear stop me and it was in turn the greatest thing I ever did. When I stepped\
  \ off that plane I was a new person, I didn\u2019t know it yet, but I was. I was\
  \ fresh, I was new and most of all, I was brave. I had new power that fueled me\
  \ and made creating this new life so exciting. Now I had the power to dream, now\
  \ I had to power to do and now I could be me, all familiarities that had constructed\
  \ me before aside. I shed layers and took breath for the first time. It was like\
  \ I was just born and freed from a slavery I didn\u2019t know I was in. Now I am\
  \ free and have done more in a year than I had in a decade. I stopped wearing makeup\
  \ and started swimming everyday, I threw away my tv and got lost in the jungle,\
  \ I traded in thoughts of what am I going to wear today for who am I as a person\
  \ and what makes me happy. I traveled to Costa Rica and Aruba and did a yoga teacher\
  \ training. I dove deep into my truth and decided to live in that value rather than\
  \ what\u2019s typical or easy. Most of all I chose to create a life I love to live\
  \ rather than dreaming of the possibility."
