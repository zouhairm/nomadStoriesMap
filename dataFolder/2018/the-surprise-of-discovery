Text: "Upon arriving by ferry from St.Thomas, we headed East in our rented jeep to\n\
  cross the steep, wildly curvy roads of St.John. For better or worse, I didn\u2019\
  t delve too\ndeeply into researching this destination beyond logistical necessities,\
  \ as I like to live the\nsurprise of discovery.\n As we neared our lodging at the\
  \ Concordia Eco-Resort we exited the moist, highelevation\nforest and entered a\
  \ surprisingly arid zone of spiny plants framing the\nturquoise waters. It was a\
  \ beautiful surprise I did not expect.\n Once arrived at our destination, we navigated\
  \ the elevated, sun-bleached,\nwooden walkways to our eco-cabin. It was also raised,\
  \ and of a simple wooden\nstructure, but wrapped in a durable fabric material with\
  \ zippered screen windows, a\nsolar shower, and of-course breathtaking views in\
  \ every direction. We took in the\nromantically rustic, simple beauty of this \u201C\
  cabin\u201D as the sun set and we made ourselves\nat home.\n Once settled, the wind\
  \ gently reminded us we were in a tarped, wooden framed\nstructure. It was like\
  \ being in a rigidly structured tent, as close to being outside as you\ncould be\
  \ while sheltered. It was perfect. Outside, another surprise, to the South, the\n\
  most shooting stars I have ever seen in one sitting, while to the North, lightening\
  \ shot\nover what I know now to be the British Island of Virgin Gorda. It was simply\
  \ awesome. I\nregretted blinking.\n Eventually the wind subsided, introducing a\
  \ mysterious new sound, from beneath\nthe cabin. I, armed with a headlamp and a\
  \ PB&J sandwich in hand, was prepared to\nexplore the dark island space beneath\
  \ the cabin. Here, I was met by the crawling,\nrustling of hundreds of points of\
  \ contact from the ground. The ground was completely\noverrun with Hermit Crabs,\
  \ easily five or six per foot in every direction. They were, as a\nunified group,\
  \ aware of me and recoiled slightly to my every movement, raising their\ndominant\
  \ claws, brandishing their weapons at me like a tiny army. It was a fascinating\n\
  experience of both sight and sound. I was captivated for some time by the procession\
  \ of\nthese creatures and their passing threat display, while they marched by with\
  \ all their\neyes focused on me.\n I then realized I had essentially just stepped\
  \ foot here and this was day one of\nnine. So off to bed, to the sound of the wind\
  \ gently testing the structure, the ocean\nlapping at the shore just below, and\
  \ the crabs fighting over my PB&J crumbs en-route to\ntheir midnight destination.\
  \ A magic introduction I couldn\u2019t wait to build on."
