  \ saying \u201Cyour crazy!\u201D \u201CA girl, to go by herself to Machu Picchu?.\u201D\
  \ \n\u201CA girl by herself in the mountains? Lost amongst the amazon?\u201D Ok\
  \ maybe I am going far depth in my crazy imagination. \nCould they be right? Just\
  \ then my annoying Iphone alarm sounds, the common alarm that is automatically set\
  \ to your setting, Buzzes at 0530 I quickly turn it off and think this is it!.\n\
  \nThe bus to the town (pueblo) was just how I pictured from an old vintage 1979\
  \ movie, no air conditioning and no one speaking English.\nI realized after talking\
  \ to a few locals, that having to be acclimated I had to rest for 24 hours so my\
  \ body can adjust to higher attitude. \nguess now was the time to read up, and walk\
  \ around the town.  I remember gazing at the stars in the sky, how enormous they\
  \ looked, \nI would catch myself finding the biggest star and had to do my wish,\
  \ something I had been doing since I was a kid, and still continue, I begin to say\
  \ out loud: \u201CStar light, star bright, first star I see tonight, I wish I may,\
  \ I wish I might, have this wish I wish tonight!\u201D\n\nThe morning wasn\u2019\
  t like my normal 5 star breakfast, I did get my tea, but this tea was made with\
  \ coca leaves it helps with the altitude yes the same coca for cocaine it tasted\
  \ like any herbal tea however, the amount of cocaine in coca is minuscule, and the\
  \ effects are quite different. \nThe bus ride to the train station was crammed with\
  \ people standing over each other, the ride was short however for some reason it\
  \ felt long.\nReaching was already daylight the sun reflecting on the trees and\
  \ grass, I could smell the wilderness, and the fresh air felt clean.\nThe walk was\
  \ intense, being so high up, and looking down towards the amazon, I wonder and thought\
  \ how we live in a material world, with the expectation of wanting more and having\
  \ no patience, during all this there are people from tribes speaking a different\
  \ language, living content with what they have, because that\u2019s all they have\
  \ learnt.  Just then an amazing a rush to my body as I felt my hairs jumped up,\
  \ I gave my self a shook and I reached my arms out, and felt like the king of the\
  \ world closing my eyes feeling toxified with the connection of this spiritual place\
  \ it was something that I wasn\u2019t expecting but at the same time felt complete\
  \ in this huge world, which I\u2019m still searching, We are still small as nothing\
  \ is what it seems at all."
