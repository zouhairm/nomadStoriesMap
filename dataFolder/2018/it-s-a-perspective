Text: "I never understood the significance of being bilingual until I went to Mexico.\n\
  Myself, a much younger version, swam in the pool of a fancy resort. I spent time\
  \ submerged beneath the water and putting the term, \u201Call you can eat buffet\u201D\
  \ to the test. Upon one of these days, I was by myself. This of course lets the\
  \ young mind wander and I remember looking around to see what could be of entertainment.\
  \ There, to the side, a girl much like myself floats on the surface of the water.\
  \ I\u2019m not too sure who found their way to whom, but gradually we found ourselves\
  \ next to each other. She reached out first.\n\u201CBonjour!\u201D\nWith one word,\
  \ she kickstarted an entirely new perspective in my mind. My second language opened\
  \ up a friendship that would\u2019ve never been so easily accessible with the language\
  \ barrier. \nThrough the next eight days, we were inseparable. Instead of lounging\
  \ with our siblings, we found ways to be with one another instead. We sipped our\
  \ fake alcoholic beverages and pretended we were much more mature than we were.\
  \ We made a bucketlist to visit every pool on the resort; and ultimately visited\
  \ every pool. It was bliss. \nAs the last days drew closer, another family ended\
  \ up coming into our section of the resort who also only spoke French. With ease,\
  \ we welcomed the two new girls as part of our small crew. Within hours, our parents\
  \ had to make an effort to try and track down our little gaggle. We\u2019d be off\
  \ heckling birds in French and when my mom finally found us, she only found us because\
  \ we were the only people aggressively shouting, \u201Cvien ici vous petit oiseaux!\u201D\
  . \nSometimes I\u2019ll feel incredibly old, reminiscing on this adventure. My hair\
  \ grows coarser and longer and will eventually lighten with grey, but this memory\
  \ stays true in my mind. Somehow, in a foreign country, being able to reach out\
  \ to people who didn\u2019t speak any of the official languages, never ceases to\
  \ amaze me. There\u2019s no limit to making intimate human connections. \nAs it\
  \ stands to this day, I\u2019m still in contact with her. More often than not, I\
  \ find my hands poised at the computer keys in the midst of messaging her. Our time\
  \ zones are different and we lead busy schedules, but we\u2019re able to make time\
  \ to send letters and emails. She\u2019s had an impact on my life beyond belief\
  \ and I'm so incredibly thankful for her. The last thing I expected on that trip\
  \ was to make a lifelong friend in uncertain circumstances."
