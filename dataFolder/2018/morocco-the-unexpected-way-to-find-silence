Text: "About 1 year ago, when I was studying in France, some brazilian friend told\
  \ me if I wanted to go to Morocco: I said yes, and that's how I went on a crazy\
  \ little trip of 5 days in the south part of Morocco near Marrakech.\n\nWe went\
  \ to Marrakech, we put our stuff in the hotel and we decided that it was time to\
  \ discover the city.\nIt was the first time for everyone in Africa, we all knew\
  \ that people have different tradition, different everydaylife and many other stuff,\
  \ but we could'nt imagine that our first meeting with the maroccan culture would\
  \ have been so shocking!\n\nWe were assaulted by moroccan people and in particular,\
  \ one from a monkey that was put on her back and she could'nt prevent that (no one\
  \ could have prevented what happened...), another one from the henna tatoo girl\
  \ (henna renamed \"puu tatoo\" because it smelled just a little).\nMe and a friend\
  \ of mine were ostage of 2 big snakes.\n\nJust to make the situation even worse,\
  \ the only girl still free was not able to shoot quickly, so we started to think\
  \ about how short life was...luckily we payed  and reached freedom.\n\nMoroccan\
  \ people are always trying to sell things to tourist, they can notice if you are\
  \ a newbie or not. You always have to pay attention and to bargain everytime, everywhere,\
  \ with everyone.\n\nI actually don't know what is the political situation there,\
  \ but there is monarchy, police is quite everywhere, and there is an high level\
  \ of poverty, but they bargain, bargain and bargain.\n\nThe second day we left the\
  \ city to reach the desert on the third day, where we would sleep.\nYes, we slept\
  \ in the desert, not inside our comfortable tent but just outside; we wanted to\
  \ feel the real essence of that place.\nWell, it was awesome, not cold, windy all\
  \ the time and the sand was dancing all over our bodies. \nIt was a great sensation\
  \ but, I have got sand in all the holes of my body for the rest 2 weeks...\n\nBy\
  \ now, I have a little warning: there are this fancy and bizarre creatures called\
  \ camels.\nMy camels, the ones who took me inside and outside the desert were not\
  \ normal and they decided to walk sideways.\n\nJust to tell you know, you also have\
  \ to \"get off\" the camel.\nThat's why, right after a ride you'll \u201Cwalk like\
  \ a cowboy\u201D for the rest of the day.\n\nHowever, while I was retourning from\
  \ the desert with my crabby-camel, the dawn was rising and the show was amazing.\n\
  \nDesert, camels, dawn and wind: everything was slow; I thought time had stopped.\
  \ \n\nThere were many sounds, but i felt only silence and peace."
