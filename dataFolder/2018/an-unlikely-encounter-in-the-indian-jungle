Text: "In the jungles of Northeast India, hospitality comes as naturally to the locals\
  \ as breathing. The pink-dusted sky, vibrant green foliage, and reflective pools\
  \ of water were our backdrop as my travel companions and I made our way to the home\
  \ of a family of 12 that we had met just one day earlier. We had travelled from\
  \ the majority Christian village that we were living in, to a majority Muslim one\
  \ where they resided. In the region, there is an unspoken rule that those from the\
  \ villages of one religion avoid socializing with those of another, so we didn\u2019\
  t expect to make many friends. Despite this, they immediately welcomed us in with\
  \ open arms and invited us to come back for what they deemed a feast.   \n\nWalking\
  \ into their home, which was dimly lit by a single lamp and couldn\u2019t have been\
  \ more than 10\u2019 by 15\u2019 in size, we sat down on the floor around bowls\
  \ of rice, curry, vegetables, and fish - the main staple of Northeast India. While\
  \ I expected them to sit down with us, the family simply stood around as the father\
  \ served us. This was when we realized that this meal - which I later found out\
  \ would have cost them a week\u2019s worth of income - was for us to enjoy, and\
  \ for them to simply serve.  \n\nWe dug right in - literally, as there are no forks\
  \ used in that region aside from the God-given ones on the ends of our arms - discovering\
  \ quickly that the plain potatoes we had been served and mixed into our curry were\
  \ actually filled with copious amounts of onions and hot peppers. With tears welling,\
  \ water nowhere in sight, and determination to eat every last bite of food on our\
  \ plates, we continued on. My friend next to me began choking on a fish bone, and\
  \ had to pretend he was totally okay in order to avoid worrying our kind hosts.\
  \ As I attempted to help him, a rogue chicken decided to lend a hand by flying across\
  \ the room and hitting me directly in the face. \n\nThroughout the meal, the family\
  \ stood around, simply watching us. When we would laugh, they would laugh. When\
  \ we would smile, they would do the same. Although none of us spoke the same language,\
  \ the connection and sense of family in that room was deep and palpable; something\
  \ that transcends words. \n\nDespite being assaulted by livestock, impaled by fish\
  \ bones, and possibly burning my esophagus on hot peppers, it was one of the best\
  \ meals I\u2019ve ever had, and the most touching connection I\u2019ve made with\
  \ a local from any country."
