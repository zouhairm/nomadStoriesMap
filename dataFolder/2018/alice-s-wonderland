Text: "I used to associate the term \"dropout\" negatively, until I found myself along\
  \ the path to something more valuable than a college education in an overly comfortable\
  \ country; until I made my way to India after five months in Europe. Until, amongst\
  \ the unfamiliarity of a completely different reality within our shared world, I\
  \ serendipitously picked up \"Chasing El Dorado\" by Aaron Smith and read, \"I hit\
  \ the road and became a First World dropout in search of something meaningful.\"\
  \ \n\nYes, this makes sense, I thought, pushed to the brink of sanity in the senselessness\
  \ that is India, while ironically and simultaneously gaining irrefutable clarity.\
  \ I learned in school that every action has a reaction, but it took leaving and\
  \ forcing myself out of my comfort zone to truly understand it.\n\nIf it gives you\
  \ butterflies, it's worth doing. Feel the fear and do it anyway.\n\nNine months\
  \ ago I was enrolled as a journalism major at the University of Nevada, Reno doing\
  \ everything \"right\" by the coveted societal standards engrained in the culture\
  \ of American youth:\n-University driven? Check.\n-Job oriented major? Check.\n\
  -Participatory extracurriculars? Check.\n-A 5 year financial plan with attainable\
  \ goals? Vaguely, but check.\n\nA golden product of a golden country, I was on my\
  \ way chasing the all elusive and ephemeral \"American Dream\" that we can be anything\
  \ we want to be, the fine print reading: but first you need a $30,000 degree. Being\
  \ conditioned by standardized testing and rubric based writing, disheartened by\
  \ the apathy of my peers pre-election, and then disappointed by their hypocritical\
  \ uproar post, I felt like a displaced person in the country of my blood.\n\nNine\
  \ months ago I looked up and realized America shimmers and glitters the same as\
  \ the desert in stifling summer heat, making everything look beautiful and magically\
  \ surreal. Nine months ago, out of curiosity--against all warnings of what it has\
  \ done to the cat--I peered into and through the facade that is the USA, and down\
  \ the rabbit hole I have fallen; drinking cups of wanderlust with the mad hatter,\
  \ and internally arguing time's significance with a rabbit in the form of my habituated,\
  \ chronological thought process, always claiming that we are late for an important\
  \ date.\n\nNine months ago I made a terrifying decision to flee from familiarity\
  \ and thus: sold my car, dropped my classes, took my savings and bought a one-way\
  \ ticket to see the world... and so it goes, as I live my bucket list at the edge\
  \ of my comfort zone."
