Text: "Vacation inspires thoughts of relaxation, adventure and excitement but three\
  \ words I didn't envision while booking my first backpacking trip were urinary tract\
  \ infection. Yet there I was on a volcanic island, in a country where I didn\u2019\
  t speak the language in desperate need of specific antibiotics. It\u2019s not my\
  \ first and I\u2019m sure not my last encounter with UTI\u2019s, once explained\
  \ by a doctor as \u201Cgenetics dear,\u201D but in Canada I could handle it. Waking\
  \ up in a hostel with limited electricity and water, the last thing I wanted to\
  \ feel were the warning signs that I'd come to know too well. I laid in sheer panic\
  \ as I realized I didn\u2019t even know how to look for a hospital let alone explain\
  \ my symptoms. \nA desperate Google search for hospitals didn\u2019t turn anything\
  \ up so I resorted to \u201CDo people go to the hospital in Nicaragua?\u201D which\
  \ was surprisingly helpful. I found that for smaller issues locals go to the pharmacy\
  \ directly. After locating one nearby I translated that I needed antibiotics, rehearsed\
  \ the phrase and felt ready. Walking into the tiny weathered concrete building with\
  \ medicine piled everywhere and a small counter in the middle of it all, my confidence\
  \ was gone. My eyes were wide as I stared in fear and shakily mumbled \u201CNecesito\
  \ antibi\xF3ticos por favor.\u201D While I fumbled for my phone in hopes of translating\
  \ the Pharmacist's questions, a kind stranger came strolling through the open door.\
  \ I gave him a nervous smile and after a quick double take he bravely came to my\
  \ rescue. \nAmusedly he asked if he could help, in English. I was immensely grateful\
  \ but also unsure of how much to divulge to this unsuspecting hero. I started with\
  \ asking for antibiotics and he not surprisingly asked why. I touched my stomach\
  \ area sheepishly hoping it would be enough but finally caved and wrote \u201Cbladder\
  \ infection\u201D into google translate. This knight in shining armour was fluent\
  \ in English but I wasn't sure if bladder infection was a phrase he'd learned. He\
  \ blushed, I blushed and then he took my phone. He spoke with the pharmacist who\
  \ proceeded to find the precise pills I needed and prepared them. He had the pharmacist\
  \ write instructions into my phone and handed it back to me. I paid a couple dollars\
  \ and thanked them both repeatedly. The sense of relief was incredible and we all\
  \ shared a laugh as I left. The trip was two weeks of adventure but this is the\
  \ one memory that will always stand out. It\u2019s not the story I thought I\u2019\
  d leave with but it's awkwardly charming, much like myself."
