Text: "A decision that pushed me to the edge\n\nI hung up on him. It was another lame\
  \ discussion, one that didn\u2019t even have to exist. How could there be true communication\
  \ if he didn\u2019t even care to understand my words? I was irritated. Not just\
  \ by him, but especially by myself. It was already my last day in Thailand and all\
  \ I did was feeding his dominant behavior by giving him what he wanted: text messages\
  \ about when I got home after a night out, how many guys were in my presence, what\
  \ I was wearing, what I was going to do and so on.. \n\nI felt depressed. I thought\
  \ that traveling by myself would be the best way to learn how to say \u2018no\u2019\
  . Was this it? Did I travel for a whole month without getting what I came here for?\
  \ This could not be the end. I decided to make the call. \n\n\u2018I\u2019m breaking\
  \ up with you. Yes, I thought this through. I don\u2019t feel like dealing with\
  \ your insecurities while that is in fact YOUR job. No, I\u2019m not seeing someone\
  \ else. But to be honest, I should be seeing someone else: myself! Why I\u2019m\
  \ breaking up now instead of tomorrow, you say? Well, because I won\u2019t be back.\
  \ I\u2019m canceling my flight. I\u2019m staying here. I do not know for how long,\
  \ but it\u2019s a fact. Good luck with everything.\u2019 \n\nOne burden less. But\
  \ I still had to call my mom to tell her she wasn\u2019t going to see me the day\
  \ after. This was going to be hard, knowing where she\u2019s coming from. \n\n\u2018\
  Hi mom! You\u2019re excited to see me tomorrow? Haha, well, I was just about to\
  \ tell you something. I\u2019ve been thinking and I have nothing that holds a grip\
  \ on me back in the Netherlands. No school, no job, no boyfriend.. I just think\
  \ that- oh, yes, you heard that right: I broke up with him. I feel so much better\
  \ now so please let\u2019s not discuss this. Yes, I thought everything through and\
  \ I will take good care of myself. Please, don\u2019t worry. I love you.\u2019 \n\
  \nSince this decision, my life has been improving. I feel free from other\u2019\
  s expectations, free from limiting visions, free from the prison that calls itself\
  \ \u2018tradition\u2019 and knows exactly how to dress itself with beautiful lies,\
  \ by telling people that they DO have a choice, but don\u2019t have to make one\
  \ because these choices have already been made for them to make their life easier!\n\
  That\u2019s false ofcourse.. Ignorance is not bliss. \n\nEventually, saying \u2018\
  no\u2019 more often was not the point. Instead, I said \u2018yes\u2019 more often.\
  \ \u2018Yes\u2019 to development, \u2018yes\u2019 to myself and \u2018yes\u2019\
  \ to becoming who I truly am. \n\nChallenging myself continuously, that\u2019s the\
  \ biggest gift travel has given me."
