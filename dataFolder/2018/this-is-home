Text: "I have always claimed to have vivid imagination. But all my pride went down\
  \ in drain as soon as I inhaled the pure air of Ranikhet. Meticulousness of my surroundings\
  \ hit me so hard that every ounce of irritation that I had, courtsey of sleeping\
  \ on the uncomfortable seats of Ranikhet Express, went away as soon as I inhaled\
  \ and exhaled and kept on repeating the process. But it was just the starting of\
  \ my life altering, hopefully never ending journey. \nAnd there sitting proudly\
  \ were the mighty Himalayas, covered with thick layer of snow, providing shelter\
  \ to the soft as cotton clouds, enchanting its onlookers and subtly kept hidden,\
  \ in my case, by the Kumaon Mountain ranges, on whose lap my car was riding on.\
  \ And Kumaon, it was no less beautiful. On my right was the deep abyss, clad perfectly\
  \ by the radiant green trees, carefully concealing the danger it accomodates. On\
  \ my left was the Kumaon itself, silently promising protection from the tree-abyss.\
  \ Thirty minutes and excruciatingly dangerous road turns later, we were roughly\
  \ 2000m above sea level and if I thought that Ranikhet or Mountains were heaven\
  \ than Nainital was something else!\nIt was drizzling in the city and we were welcomed\
  \ again, by the exquisite sight of Nainital lake, sitting proudly amidst the five\
  \ o' clock ruckus of the city and enjoying the gentle natural shower. I felt utterly\
  \ relaxed by the view and my lips curled upwards in response. Five minutes later\
  \ we found shelter under a bus stop, to avoid the drizzling which was turning into\
  \ a full blown shower. It wasn't enough and did nothing to soothe my ghoosebumps\
  \ which appeared out of surprise rather than cold, but atleast our clothes were\
  \ dry. Forcing myself out of the lake induced trance, I looked around, we were standing\
  \ right next to a chai stall. Having nothing better to do since we were stuck, I\
  \ decided to force my attention to the chai which was now brewing. 'What an irony!',\
  \ I smiled. In front of me, rain was pouring down with no intention of slowing and\
  \ right next to me, the perfect blend of tea leaves, water, sugar and milk was boiling,\
  \ with no intention of slowing down and I was lost, lost in the meaning of life,\
  \ freezing and boiling, two opposite phenomena, taking place together. Theory of\
  \ simultaneity! Never did I found boiling of tea, so captivating and pouring of\
  \ water, so freezing! I was trapped, officially, and it was just half past five\
  \ on the first day. 'This is home!', I whispered and a beautiful smile graced my\
  \ lips."
