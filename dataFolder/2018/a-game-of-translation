Text: "Fateena and I stood together, shyly grinning, waiting for each other to say\
  \ something. I had just finished my tour and we were walking through the Old Town\
  \ souq area in Hebron, one of the most turbulent regions of the West Bank. She looked\
  \ as young as me and I wanted to ask her how she managed to live in a city that\
  \ wore its ancestors conflicts on its streets. I didn\u2019t know where to begin;\
  \ I couldn\u2019t find the words to bridge the immense difference between our worlds.\
  \ \n\nBefore I could say anything, Fateena held her phone up close to my face, waiting\
  \ for Google translate to convert her Arabic into my English. \u2018Where you from?\u2019\
  \ flashed on her slightly dented, greatly outdated Samsung smartphone. I typed in\
  \ \u2018India\u2019 and her eyes glistened. She frantically typed something into\
  \ her phone. \u2018You like tea? Have you had Palestinian tea?\u2019 I hadn\u2019\
  t, so I shook my head and she pointed towards a stall to the left of where we were\
  \ standing. \n\nThe street was lined with vendors selling plump oranges, tiny bags\
  \ of aromatic spices, hand-embroidered wallets with the Palestinian flag. We walked\
  \ towards Fateena\u2019s father\u2019s tea stall. As we three stood there drinking\
  \ milky, ginger tea her father started loudly shouting in Arabic. He pointed at\
  \ the dilapidated buildings around him. Fateena translated her father\u2019s words\
  \ through her phone. \u2018That used to be where my brother sold handmade shawls.\
  \ They kicked him out. That corner was where we would gather for Eid. We aren\u2019\
  t allowed to gather any more. Everyone has left.\u2019 Fateena\u2019s father was\
  \ still grieving, lost in memories of a map whose lines had been written over. \
  \ \n\nSitting by the corner of her father\u2019s stall, with her phone as our mediator,\
  \ and another pot of tea, Fateena and I asked each other questions that had no exact\
  \ translations or answers. \u2018Why have you come here? Is India very beautiful?\
  \ What do you do with your friends in Hebron? Is it dangerous? Is it difficult?\
  \ What\u2019s your favourite tea?\u2019 With a lot of laughter, fragments of responses,\
  \ and many translation failures we eventually ended up sitting together in comfortable\
  \ silence. Her data was almost out, but very excitedly she insisted that I must\
  \ write my name down on a paper because she wanted me to be her friend on Facebook.\
  \ I hugged Fateena goodbye, and left my name on a scrap of paper.  Her friend request\
  \ never reached me, and it's been a year now. Some days, when I get a new message\
  \ on Facebook, I can\u2019t help but hope that it\u2019s Fateena asking me how I\
  \ drink my tea."
