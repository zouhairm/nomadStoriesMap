Text: "There were plenty of things I expected from my first trip to Mexico. I expected\
  \ tequila, burritos, and ruins. I expected that people would speak Spanish.  I also\
  \ was hoping to learn something about Mexicans.\n\nBeing me, I wasn't satisfied\
  \ to go to the places where most tourists go but that doesn't mean I didn't want\
  \ to see the sites, like Chich\xE9n Itz\xE1, that are famous around the world. \
  \ Approximately 1.2 million people visit this complex of Mayan ruins every year,\
  \ most as a day-trip from Cancun.  I went by bus, along with a bus load of Mexicans,\
  \ to the village of Piste which is walking distance to Chich\xE9n Itz\xE1.  I stayed\
  \ in a small, budget hotel and ate at La Cocina Economica.  Besides being a restaurant\
  \ in the converted garage of the owner\u2019s home, it was also the neighbourhood\
  \ chicken supplier.  Chickens could be seen running in the vegetable garden behind\
  \ the house. This restaurant doesnt get many tourists.\n\nPiste is divided by a\
  \ major highway that runs between Cancun and Merida. The black top shimmered with\
  \ the heat it had collected throughout the day.  Walking along in the sand at the\
  \ edge of the road, I saw a dog attempting to cross this very busy thoroughfare.\
  \  Buses and large trucks were zooming by and my heart was in my throat I as believed\
  \ I was going to witness this dog's death.  I called out \"Don't do it! You will\
  \ be killed!\" A man, leaning up against the wall of a small house, called out to\
  \ me, \"I don't think that dog speaks English.\" I replied, \"Probably not, but\
  \ I am sure he will understand my tone.\"  We struck up a conversation and the man\
  \ asked me if I would like to come inside and meet his 'pet'. The fact that he didn't\
  \ say what sort of animal his pet was, caught my interest.  Clearly, he wasn't talking\
  \ about a cat or dog.  I took the bait.\n\nThe front room of the man's house was\
  \ an art gallery and I purchased a wooden carving of the Mayan snake-god, Kukulkan,\
  \ as a gift for a friend.  Then we went into an adjoining room. After a minute or\
  \ two, the man walked back in with a jaguar kitten; I dropped to the floor.  Chico\
  \ Loco ran over and, grabbing me by the arm, tried to wrestle with me. He was the\
  \ length of my forearm with huge paws foretelling how big he would be one day. \n\
  Not in a million years, did I expect to be able to play with a baby jaguar."
