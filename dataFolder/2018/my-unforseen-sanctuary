Text: "My aunt is crazy. An unanticipated break up 48 hours before a dream trip for\
  \ two to Italy left me contemplating the lesser of two evils: abandoning the trip\
  \ or departing solo. While I was sobbing in her lap, dejected at the thought of\
  \ walking this world alone, she booked me a Contiki tour around Italy without asking\
  \ me. She\u2019s crazy, but the good kind. \n\nA 10-hour stopover in Hong Kong en\
  \ route to Italy. The perfect pocket of time to embark on a mission up Victoria\
  \ Peak, a mountain in the Western area of the country that I hoped would look as\
  \ breathtakingly serene in person as it did on Google Images. \n\nFirst came humidity.\
  \ Stifling, infuriating humidity. Traversing through mountain heat, the fantasy\
  \ of my athletic endurance and stamina was shattered. \n\nNearing the mountains\
  \ crown, my surprisingly dismal level of fitness sank into my peripheral. Breathless,\
  \ I was enthralled with the jungle paradise before me. The hiking track was like\
  \ a scene directly from The Jungle Book. Draped in vibrant greenery. Mystical yet\
  \ soothing. Half expecting Mowgli and Baloo to emerge, I paced myself and kept walking,\
  \ trying to block out the penetrating thoughts that this enchanting experience was\
  \ worthless without someone by my side. \n\nTrekking on, my sadness melted into\
  \ my surroundings, forgotten. My senses detonated. Dainty flowers peeking through\
  \ greenery distracted me from my solitude, the smell of nature, real, pure nature,\
  \ stole my thoughts from sombreness, and the gentle swish of trees became the dominant\
  \ voice in my head. \n\nAll the while, the heat bore down. Even the shrubbery was\
  \ desperate for shade.  \n\nI contemplated giving up and heading down. I don\u2019\
  t know why, but it felt like a choice between returning to my anguish or pushing\
  \ forward to empowerment. \n\nI kept walking. \n\nReaching the peak, it dawned on\
  \ me that I had forgotten to be sad. I scanned the oasis in front of me. Staring\
  \ at Hong Kong\u2019s skyscrapers encircled in lush flora, a world of beauty and\
  \ possibility stared back at me.\n\nAtop Victoria peak, there are no digital distractions.\
  \ No requirements and no responsibility. There is only life, just existing and experiencing,\
  \ just being in the moment. Taking sanctuary from the modern world illuminated the\
  \ path down which I would walk, for the first time in my life, no longer afraid\
  \ to be alone.  \n \nThe last thing I expected to find on the mountaintop of a foreign\
  \ country thousands of miles away from home was an invigoration for my life."
