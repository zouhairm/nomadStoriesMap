Text: "The walk from the school to the camp was ingrained in my daily routine by this\
  \ stage. A line of children slowly snaked past the harbor and around the castle\
  \ walls, backpacks like turtle shells, ably shepherded by my fellow volunteers.\
  \ Look beyond the castle walls and you\u2019re presented with the glistening azure\
  \ of the Aegean sea; look down and you\u2019re presented with a different kind of\
  \ sea, although no less blue. \n\nThe sea of UNHCR tents beneath the castle was\
  \ Souda, a makeshift camp intended to be a temporary stopping-off point on the journeys\
  \ of the thousands of refugees passing through the Greek island of Chios, at this\
  \ stage still makeshift, but far from temporary. Some of the children I taught at\
  \ the school had been living there for six months when I arrived in August 2016.\
  \ \n\nDespite the circumstances in which they found themselves, the children loved\
  \ to invite their teacher in for tea and their parents were happy to oblige. This\
  \ daily ritual became a welcome chance to relax and get to know the children and\
  \ their families. One father, reminiscing about his house in Aleppo, recalled with\
  \ anguish how their pet parrot had taken flight when their house was hit by a bomb.\
  \ \n\n\u2018We couldn\u2019t just fly away, but he could,\u2019 he said in between\
  \ sips of Arabic coffee. \u2018The cats next door are real survivors.\u2019 \n\n\
  Having assumed he meant stray cats frequenting the camp, after much patient explaining\
  \ on his behalf, my confusion turned to disbelief when it transpired that the family\
  \ in the next tent door had travelled from Syria to Greece, treacherous boat journey\
  \ included, with their cat. \n\nTo assuage my doubts, we went next door. The tarpaulin\
  \ was swung back to reveal Lolita. Majestic and regal, Lolita casually purred and\
  \ regarded me with a look of distain. She was a snow-white Persian, her coat not\
  \ well suited to the stifling heat of a tent in summer. Unlike Lolita\u2019s frosty\
  \ demeanor, her owners were exceedingly hospitable. I was not in a position to accept\
  \ their offer of a drink because my hands were full. Each hand held a squirming,\
  \ mewling fluff ball; Lolita was a mother! \n\nHer kittens were thrust in my direction\
  \ by their proud owner the moment I sat down. Through the turmoil of displacement,\
  \ Lolita had kept her family going, falling pregnant in Turkey and surviving the\
  \ boat journey to give birth in Greece.  \n\nWhen human suffering is a hallmark\
  \ of the refugee crisis it may seem trite to focus on an animal, yet they journey\
  \ with us, even the parrot that flew away."
