Text: "I had been in Damascus for two weeks when I met her. It was the summer of 2008,\
  \ and I was spending five weeks in an intensive Arabic course at the University.\
  \ The decision was made after much research, but was really an excuse to be in one\
  \ place for enough time to get to know its rhythms, to have a favourite restaurant,\
  \ to memorize the smell of jasmine at night.\n\nIf you are lucky, you will meet\
  \ people that will change your life, who will stretch your mind to such a degree\
  \ that you will never again fit into your previous life. But in order to meet these\
  \ people, you need to sit still long enough. You need those conversations late at\
  \ night, screaming over the music, grasping at all the half languages you know so\
  \ you can reach across the divide and connect to another human being. \n\nAt the\
  \ moment I met Noura, I was fascinated with gender and body language, and specifically\
  \ with how everyone could tell I was not from there by the way I walked. Noura sat\
  \ down across the table from me at a very smoky caf\xE9. Her hair was short, and\
  \ her sleeveless shirt showed off the tone and muscle of her body. She rolled herself\
  \ a cigarette and elegantly smashed through all the gender norms with the finesse\
  \ of a Japanese sword. \n\nShe was a University professor and the Director of a\
  \ movement theatre company. A few days later I was in the old city, where actors\
  \ had come from all over Syria to take an intensive workshop led by Noura on \u201C\
  movement\u201D. Her observations about human nature were deeply astute, at once\
  \ chilling in their clarity and incredibly comforting in their compassion and optimism.\n\
  \nI put down my Arabic grammar books, and picked up my camera. I had just found\
  \ a way to tell stories: visually.\n\nNoura and I became great friends, and for\
  \ the remainder of my trip I stepped into Noura\u2019s fascinating world. She introduced\
  \ me to musicians, filmmakers, dancers, artists and thinkers. She opened the door\
  \ to noisy concerts, cool clubs and sidewalk cafes. I drank 537 cups of coffee (without\
  \ sugar, but with cardamom) and smoked  way too many hand-rolled cigarettes. Because\
  \ of her, I sat around the table with the city\u2019s brilliant minds, that were\
  \ exploding with creativity and frustration. I listened with my ears, but mostly\
  \ with my eyes and my camera.\n\nI returned to Damascus in 2009, but even then I\
  \ had seen nothing outside of the10km radius of where I lived. What I had done though,\
  \ was start a friendship that has lasted a decade, and find myself a new career\
  \ as a photographer."
