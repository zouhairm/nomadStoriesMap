Text: "Up. Down. In. Out. I laid on the shore, watching my chest rise and fall with\
  \ each ragged breath, the rhythm matching the waves that had boldly tried to drag\
  \ me into their depths. \n\nThe last thing I had expected was to come so close to\
  \ my demise in such an alluring place. But then again, who ever really expects to.\
  \ We had arrived in Playa Grande, Costa Rica only one day earlier. My sister and\
  \ I had been drawn here with the promise of dazzling beaches and untamed wilderness.\
  \ It seemed to be the perfect country to embark on a backpacking adventure. \n\n\
  Playa Grande is just to the north of Tamarindo, separated by a small inlet. We were\
  \ delighted when we arrived and had to flag down a battered blue fishing boat to\
  \ get us across the crocodile-infested water separating the two towns. \n\nThat\
  \ first night we ran to the ocean. I marvelled at the vastness of such a beautiful\
  \ but unmarred beach, while I sank my toes into the sand and let the warm waves\
  \ roll over them. Every time the water rushed over me I felt a slight tugging at\
  \ my legs, almost as if the turquoise tide was summoning me to come in and play.\
  \ Later that evening, intrigued by the earlier sensation, I decided to search out\
  \ why the water tugged on me. Little did I know that simple internet query would\
  \ soon save my life. \n\nThe next day we woke with the sunrise, put on our swimming\
  \ attire and journeyed to the beach. Once again, we were the only people on the\
  \ long, empty shore. \n\nThough it was early morning the sun was already hot on\
  \ our backs and the Pacific waters looked inviting.  My sister and I raced each\
  \ other into the ocean and started frolicking like children. Diving in and out of\
  \ the waves that crashed on the shore until we tired and floated on our backs, reveling\
  \ in the beauty all around us. \n\nEventually we decided to head back to the beach\
  \ but our languid paddling soon turned to vigorous strokes as we realized we weren\u2019\
  t getting any closer to shore. In fact, we were now behind the waves that, minutes\
  \ before, had crested over us.  I looked over at my sister as the realization dawned\
  \ on her face. We were being dragged out to sea. \n\nMy panicked brain quickly recalled\
  \ what I\u2019d read the night before. Realizing we must be caught in a riptide\
  \ I screamed for my sister to swim sideways, out of the current\u2019s deathly grip.\
  \ The moment we broke free and started catapulting back to shore was a moment of\
  \ relief I will never forget. This brush with death was a stark reminder that even\
  \ things of beauty can turn dark."
