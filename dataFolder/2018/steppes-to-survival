Text: "As I bit down on the chunk of hot meat and the juice oozed over my tongue,\
  \ I felt a mixture of joy and guilt. Joy because it tasted surprisingly good. Guilt\
  \ because our host had so little, and yet had given us so much.\n\nI was cycling\
  \ across the Mongolian steppe with two friends and our interpreter, Guildar. A dream\
  \ to cycle, the grass hills of the steppe rose and fell endlessly towards the broad\
  \ horizon, like a rumpled, jade-green quilt. \n\nWe had grown familiar with the\
  \ white dots in the distance, which, as we drew closer, showed themselves to be\
  \ nomadic settlements of two or three round tents, or gers. \n\nLooking up the hill,\
  \ we saw we had just passed a huddle of gers.\n\nSuddenly there was the sound of\
  \ galloping hooves behind us. Dressed in a heavy, brown tunic to his knees with\
  \ a felt hat framing ruddy cheeks, the stocky rider came to sharp halt beside us\
  \ in a flurry of flapping leather. He spoke quickly to Guildar.\n\n\u201CThis is\
  \ Batu, he\u2019s invited us to eat with his family,\u201D Guildar said. Knowing\
  \ we were on tight schedule, he quietly said in an aside: \u201CWelcoming travellers\
  \ into his home will bring luck to his family. We can\u2019t refuse.\u201D\n\nThe\
  \ three of us glanced at the narrow track stretching into the distance, thinking\
  \ about the miles we still needed to cycle that day. Then we smiled gratefully at\
  \ Batu and pushed our laden bikes up the hill.\n\nWe discovered this was no ordinary\
  \ meal of boiled mutton and noodles. Our host intended to kill a goat in our honour\
  \ and cook it in the traditional way: mixing red hot stones with chunks of meat.\
  \ \n\n\u201CPlease tell Batu we don\u2019t want to take food away from his family,\
  \ Guildar,\u201D I pleaded.\n\nBut, Batu shook his head emphatically and beamed\
  \ at us with his electric smile. The decision had been made. He said it was an honour\
  \ to welcome us into his home.\n\nOur arrival was celebrated with the extended family\
  \ for hours. We were given the best cuts of meat. Vodka was passed around. The children\
  \ played with our bikes and examined our tent. There was laughter and singing.\n\
  \nWhen I had set off on the ride around Mongolia, I had imagined amazing places,\
  \ interesting people, and memorable experiences. I didn\u2019t imagine learning\
  \ how to gracefully accept overwhelming hospitality with no expectation of giving\
  \ anything in return. Of being celebrated simply for arriving.\n\n\u201CNomads depend\
  \ on hospitality for survival,\u201D Guildar said when we left. \u201COne day, when\
  \ they need it, they\u2019ll receive what they\u2019ve given to us from someone\
  \ else.\u201D"
