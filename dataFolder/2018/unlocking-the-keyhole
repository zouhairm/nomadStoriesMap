Text: "There are two overhead environments on Trail #2, they warned us in the dive\
  \ briefing. The first, The Keyhole, is a quick swim-through. The second is longer\
  \ than I am tall. You can watch exhaled bubbles amalgamate like puddles of quicksilver\
  \ on the ceiling, then slither along grooves in the rock on their way to the surface.\
  \ In the open water, with no points of reference but the shadows of colossal pillars,\
  \ it\u2019s hard to tell how deep you could sink into the inky abyss. Still, it\
  \ was The Keyhole that gave me trouble.\n\nOne of the most unusual SCUBA diving\
  \ sites in the world, Bonne Terre is an old lead mine in Missouri. The pumps that\
  \ once kept it dry now partially flood it, creating a cavern open for diving year-round.\
  \ I went in January, lugging my gear past snow banks before heading down rough-hewn\
  \ steps into the earth.\n\nOn the second dive, I was determined to take my camera.\
  \ Pressing record, I watched the mine unfold before me through my screen. Observing\
  \ the dive through the camera had its drawbacks. Balancing it and clutching my depth\
  \ gauge with a cramping hand for fear of dropping too deep was distracting. As we\
  \ swam towards The Keyhole, the glow sticks hung on the tanks of the divers ahead\
  \ of me started to fade impossibly rapidly. It felt dire, then surreal, to see them\
  \ glide away so fast, like I was zooming out with a lens. My moment of panic was\
  \ logged as the camera dropped to hang by the strap on my wrist, swinging wildly\
  \ as I kicked hard to catch up. Afterwards, the camera got less heed.\n\nWe were\
  \ explorers, archaeologists instead of tourists in an exhibit. Wooden staircases\
  \ and the skeletal frame of an elevator shaft evoked images of the Titanic. Once,\
  \ our guide held a welding mask to his face. Torch shining from underneath, he was\
  \ a rust-orange specter. I\u2019d almost lost sight of the group, but I did lose\
  \ sight of something else: the fact that I was on a tour. My only souvenirs: the\
  \ video and a single stone from the mine floor slipped covertly into my neoprene\
  \ glove, pressed hard against my palm for the rest of the dive.\n\nTelling this\
  \ story, I never leave out the scare. Not to intimidate or impress, but because\
  \ it was the most memorable part of the trip. It\u2019s shocking what our brains\
  \ can do in a risky situations. Sometimes marvelous experiences are tinged with\
  \ a second of fear that can be overcome with skills, knowledge and keeping a cool\
  \ head. What adventure doesn\u2019t have a bit of discomfort or trepidation?"
