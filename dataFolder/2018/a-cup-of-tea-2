  \ said, barely giving him a glance as I went on my way. He was one of the many vendors\
  \ in Jaipur, always on the lookout for tourists. \n\nI had no interest in what he\
  \ had to offer. At that time, I had no interest at all in general. I was walking\
  \ around because that seemed the best thing to do, but I saw nothing and felt nothing.\
  \ \n\nA week ago, I had been in Varanasi, full of excitement as I went around the\
  \ Old City with pockets full of colored powder. It was Holi, and I was excited to\
  \ play.\n\nThe other hotel guests and I smeared colored powder on each other\u2019\
  s faces. We were in high spirits as we walked along the Ganges.\n\nThat is, until\
  \ we met a group of men who surrounded me and started grabbing my chest, laughing\
  \ as I wept and raged helplessly.\n\nIn less a minute, it was over. We sat down\
  \ on the steps by the Ganges as I sobbed uncontrollably. \n\nThat experience left\
  \ me feeling helpless for the first time. I didn\u2019t know what to do so I just\
  \ went on with my trip.\n\nI was blind to the charms of Jaipur. It has old forts\
  \ and palaces, but I couldn\u2019t appreciate them. \n\nEvery single day that I\
  \ was there, I walked. I walked to get rid of the feeling that Varanasi left me.\
  \ I walked to prove to myself that not all of India is like the Holy City. I walked\
  \ because every place I\u2019ve traveled solo since I was 11 was always welcoming\
  \ to me.\n\nAnd finally, I walked because I wanted to get back the control that\
  \ Varanasi took from me.\n\nThe second day I was greeted by the vendor, I said hi\
  \ back. His name was Shiva and he managed his family\u2019s shop across Hawa Mahal.\
  \ \u201CCome and drink chai with me,\u201D he said.\n\nThe shop was full of silver\
  \ jewelry behind locked glass cases. He brought out chairs on the terrace, gave\
  \ me tea, and asked me about my trip.\n\nI started telling him about Varanasi and\
  \ I couldn\u2019t stop. He just sat there and listened, a vendor who should have\
  \ been out getting customers instead of listening to a tourist blabber.\n\nWhen\
  \ I ran out of words, he patted my hand and told me he had to go back on the street.\n\
  \nI stayed behind, sipping my tea and looking at the pink and red sandstone across\
  \ the street. I thought about how funny life can be. After my experience in Varanasi,\
  \ I thought all men in India were the same.\n\nAnd yet, there I was, sipping chai\
  \ in a young vendor\u2019s shop, looking at one of the wonders of the Pink City,\
  \ pondering on the meaning of life and ending up just wanting another cup of tea."
