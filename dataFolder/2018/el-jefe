Text: "If you ask me \u2013 and even if you don\u2019t \u2013 no visit to Madrid is\
  \ worth the whistle without a trip down Calle Echegaray, there to visit El Jefe.\n\
  Echegaray is a reticent little street, idling away amidst the Barrio de las Letras,\
  \ the literary quarter, where streets answer to the call of names like Cervantes\
  \ and Lope de Vega, and where the snarl of traffic from the Paseo del Prado is muted\
  \ to an almost inaudible purr.\nOn our first visit to Madrid, I brought my wife\
  \ to this very street in search of literature. History. Not Jos\xE9 Echegaray himself,\
  \ though the unexpected engineer-turned-Nobel-Prize-winning writer might have made\
  \ a plausible metaphor for this tale. We were in search of \u2018Don Ernesto\u2019\
  \ Hemingway and the Civil War.\nLa Venencia, on Calle Echegaray, remains as detached\
  \ from modernity as its Barrio is from the scurry of city life. To drink there is\
  \ to feel like history is not history at all. That the 1930s live on. That Don Ernesto\u2019\
  s spirit stalks around this old watering hole even yet. La Venencia, once a hub\
  \ of Republican resistance against the fascist fifth column, is where Hemingway\
  \ as a young journalist used to seek the latest intelligence from the front, and\
  \ it retains an aura of conspiratorial defiance.\nOn that first reconnoitre we tried\
  \ to act natural, the eyes of flat-capped old comrades studiously not on us but\
  \ observing us. We edged up to the bar. A plain chalkboard carta with just five\
  \ sherries by the glass and nothing besides. The barman eyed us and cocked his head\
  \ back, as if to ascertain whether we outsiders knew the code. We didn\u2019t. He\
  \ poured two glasses of fino in long draughts straight from the barrel, as he might\
  \ have done for Hemingway himself, and etched our tab in chalk on the bar next to\
  \ a dish of pump, buttery green olives. We slipped off to a dim back corner.\nIt\
  \ seemed apt, in one of Hemingway\u2019s old haunts, to offer my wife the fluffy,\
  \ cushioned chair, yet quite unexpectedly as she crouched to sit, the cushion glared\
  \ accusingly, flashing green eyes. My wife gasped. The cat sprang across the table,\
  \ rattling the glasses, then cast a cool glance back and ambled away. We had expected\
  \ Don Ernesto. History. Not a cat.\nToday, La Venencia remains reassuringly defiant.\
  \ Sometimes we meet El Jefe\u2019s glare in passing, or as he nestles at the corner\
  \ of the bar. Sometimes the barman will smile in vague recognition.\n\u201CWhere\
  \ is el gato negro? Has he gone?\u201D my wife recently enquired as we settled the\
  \ tab.\n\u201CViene y va,\u201D he comes and goes. \u201CEs el Jefe.\u201D"
