Text: "I flipped through the pages of \"Southeast Asia on a Shoestring\", occasionally\
  \ looking out the windows of the overnight bus and into the dark and quiet of night\
  \ in Vietnam. We were on our way to Hoi An. There was something incredibly serene\
  \ about being in my own little compartment, resting my head on my backpack full\
  \ of souvenirs and miscellaneous items that I had acquired on my trip thus far.\
  \ The chapter I was mesmerized on was Cambodia, a country that has a surprisingly\
  \ recent history full of tragedy but also a rich past full of beautiful temples\
  \ and structures that are significant to so many. I yearned to climb those temples\
  \ with my own two feet and feel the history fill my veins to carry those stories\
  \ with me to share back with my less traveled family in the United States and inspire\
  \ others to do the same. With an overwhelming sense of obligation to not skip a\
  \ country full of such incredible people and rich history, I had officially decided.\
  \ I was going to Cambodia, even if that meant leaving my friends behind and going\
  \ off onto a solo adventure.  \n\nI nervously held my luggage on my lap as I rode\
  \ the back of the motorcycle on my way to the bus station. I waved goodbye to my\
  \ two friends that I was leaving behind to conquer the rest of this adventure on\
  \ my own. I was heading to Cambodia, and this time, I was on my own. The thought\
  \ of traveling solo both terrified and excited me. Never had I been completely on\
  \ my own, especially not on the other side of the world from my small-town home\
  \ in New Jersey. My parents were hesitant when I had called to share the news the\
  \ night before, but here I was on the other side of the world and nobody could stop\
  \ me from following the passion for travel that I had developed. \n\nTraveling Cambodia\
  \ solo was an incredibly empowering experience. I remember feeling this sense of\
  \ immense freedom that I had the ability to whatever my heart desired. I woke up\
  \ at 4:30am to watch the sunrise above Angkor Wat, as many tourists in the area\
  \ do. I stood as one of hundreds waiting to watch the beautiful scene, and then\
  \ roamed around the ancient grounds, breathing in the history all around me. More\
  \ importantly, a newfound sense of freedom blossomed inside me, and as I close my\
  \ \"Southeast Asia on a Shoestring\" book and put it back on my shelf at my desk\
  \ back home, I smile as I remind myself that I am truly capable of doing anything\
  \ that I set my mind to."
