Text: "As part of my tour of Thailand, our tour group had spent a couple of days in\
  \ Chiang Mai getting a feel for the busy hustle and bustle of the night markets\
  \ and the club life. Now, however, it was time for us to head to isolation at the\
  \ elephant home in rural Chiang Mai.\nAfter what seemed like an eternity driving\
  \ through winding hills and ever disappearing villages, we finally arrived at Maevang.\
  \ This place was different from the rest: they strive to create a more natural environment\
  \ for the elephants to live. They don't allow you to ride the elephants, only walk\
  \ alongside them down to the river to give them a bath and a play. This was much\
  \ more rewarding.\nHowever, there was a young man there who intrigued me more: Jungle\
  \ Lek was the name he went by. He was so happy being around the elephants and living\
  \ out here, and my friend who had previously been on this tour had told me with\
  \ such excitement about this mysterious fellow.\nOur next day we were trekking up\
  \ to a hut in the jungle to spend the night with Mother Nature. On our way up, my\
  \ curiosity with Jungle Lek got the better if me so spent the entire trek pretending\
  \ I wasn't completely out of breath (to which I very much was) in order to spend\
  \ the trek alongside him. \nThis was something I didn't regret: I spent the whole\
  \ walk in awe of everything he showed me. The magic of the jungle. \nEvery step\
  \ there was something new to discover: a hidden waterfall just a few steps from\
  \ path that felt like an oasis after two hours trekking in the sun. Around the next\
  \ corner, deep red leaves that he would break apart to draw intricate designs on\
  \ your arm like a temporary jungle tattoo. A few minutes later, and we were stopped\
  \ on a grass verge. He picked out a very distinctive leaf, smooth and curved with\
  \ a thick stem. He broke the stem in half, almost as if he were creating a daisy\
  \ chain, but instead, created a small hole and rubbed it together. Then, with a\
  \ delicate breath, he blew into the leaf and covered us not only with the small\
  \ bubbles that appeared, but with amazement as well.\nHalfway up, and he had picked\
  \ up a small piece of bamboo and was carving it as we carried on towards the hut.\
  \ It wasn't until we reached the hut that he presented to us this small shot glass\
  \ with elephants and palm trees intricately carved into the side. This was a gift\
  \ to us and I'd never felt more humbled by someone so quickly. \nI guess that's\
  \ why, even two months after I've left Thailand, I still keep in contact with Jungle\
  \ Lek."
