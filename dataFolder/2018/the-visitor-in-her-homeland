Text: "For someone who was brought up in a different country than her origins, yet\
  \ deeply connected rooted in terms of upbringing and traditions and being multi-lingual,\
  \ I was often told by my parents that we need to preserve our identity and traditions.\
  \ I\u2019m a Hakka Chinese girl, born and raised in India in a small town near the\
  \ capital, New Delhi. I grew up speaking English, Hakka (an old Chinese dialect)\
  \ and Hindi, my parents were strong advocates of knowing our roots and to speak\
  \ Hakka at home. We didn\u2019t really have our families living in China, at least\
  \ that\u2019s what my parents thought since our grandparents left everything they\
  \ had and moved to Calcutta, India during the World War II, with nothing but the\
  \ need to survive and their families with them.\nIn recent times did we discover\
  \ our extended long lost families that were still living in Guangzhou, China, \u201C\
  my native land\u201D. In January 2017, my entire maternal family and I were visiting\
  \ my maternal grandfather\u2019s house. What I expected was a very small town and\
  \ populated city with no internet and assuming the language barrier, but to our\
  \ surprise, it was completely the opposite (wasn't wrong about the internet though),\
  \ just like any other modern city in the world. My nieces, twice as old as me -\
  \ I often forget how aggressively us Chinese people have procreated, came to receive\
  \ us at the bus station. We reached Guangzhou at midnight and they took us to a\
  \ small street food joint for dinner where we were served one of my absolute favorite\
  \ dishes that I had only eaten at home. It was while we were ordering our food I\
  \ had an epiphany, I was able to converse with the server in Hakka, something that\
  \ I had never experienced all my life to talk to a complete stranger in a dialect\
  \ I only spoke with my family. And suddenly at that moment everything around seemed\
  \ more comfortable and like \u201Chome\u201D. Waking up at my grandfather\u2019\
  s house felt home in ways I couldn\u2019t comprehend, we took a tour around the\
  \ area and my cousins told us about the forefathers we never knew existed. I couldn\u2019\
  t possibly fathom and process how much history and lineage about my origins that\
  \ little piece of land held. It was surreal knowing these very people unfolding\
  \ history and facts right before my eyes were, in fact, my long lost family. \n\
  My cousins suggested we should come back \"home\" and stay here, it was strange\
  \ how they referred to this place as home to me, a home I never really knew I had\
  \ and a place where I was a visitor according to my passport!"
