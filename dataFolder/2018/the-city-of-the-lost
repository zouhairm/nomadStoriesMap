Text: "10 june\nWell as soon as i boarded my flight from Delhi and was on full traveling\
  \ mode. Bit of frevor on the flight. Fellow in economy class turns out to be truly\
  \ sick, jerking and moaning without end. All amid this, I am chatting with one of\
  \ the attendants, learning arabian culture.\n8 hours foight to cairo, bit unsavory\
  \ with four bihari guys who never quiets down. Fully excited about my internship\
  \ but mostly about the fun that awaits in Egypt. I soon started dozing off as soon\
  \ as the lights were turned of in flight.\n11 may \nEventually, My taxi came at\
  \ the airport met 4 more guys from my city who turned to be my own roommates at\
  \ apartment. Fully tired went straight after having ashower.\nEvening comes dropped\
  \ a message to my family that i have reached here in one piece.\nNow, all set to\
  \ explore cairo. I went straight to Nile River which had an atonishing beauty in\
  \ it. A nice cup of tea and river view was all I needed to feel refreshed.\n12 june\n\
  Off to the giza pyramids a half an hour trip better to use uber well i prefer it.\
  \ Reached the destination and damn what a freaking sight it was i can see it from\
  \ this far away we hired camels to travel and yeah that made me feel more Arabian.\
  \ Well I wanted to ridea camel. Well, back to pyramids i felt lost in its sight\
  \ so much that I can feel the peace around. I was definitely feeling energy here.\
  \ I can feel the breeze around me. These pyramids were having stairs on it to reach\
  \ the top i climbed the largest one and started clicking pictures what a sight it\
  \ was I am still amazed by it.The vitality was streaming down and into the land\
  \ around me."
