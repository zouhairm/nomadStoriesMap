Text: "In Poland we have one small mountain range which is really high and rocky.\
  \ Anyway big number of various attractions concentrated in this small area make\
  \ Tatras really famous on the touristic Europe map. One of the biggest attraction\
  \ is an amazing landscape around the \u201CMorskie Oko\u201D (Sea Eye) lake.\nThe\
  \ first summit which attracts attention of someone who is entering this area is\
  \ \u201CMnich\u201D (Monk) which looks amazing but completely inaccessible. And\
  \ this is the reason why some crazy people want to reach the top of this mountain\
  \ or even completely insane who want to do it by visible eastern wall which is one\
  \ of the most difficult rocky wall in Polish mountains.\nThat summer I was in Tatras\
  \ with bigger group but spent days rather lonely, accomplishing my targets because\
  \ normal hiking paths used by my colleagues was too easy for me. \nOne day I met\
  \ unexpectedly my friend from the climbing club. He said that one day earlier he\
  \ lonely reached the Monk and convinced me to do the same. He draw for me quickly\
  \ a plan how to climb the top but as I could see later he was not talented in drawing.\
  \ \nSo next day I decided to go but despite of middle of the summer there was extremely\
  \ cold. To feel warmer I moved very quickly. After a few hours I was by the north\
  \ face of the Monk. When I stayed there I did not see any similarity to the drawing\
  \ which I received from my colleague. And did not see any possibility to reach the\
  \ top. Anyway I decided to climb up. The only possible way up for me was in the\
  \ vertical, steep chimney. After some time when I was twenty meters higher I found\
  \ the ice in the chimney. The heat wave of fear flooded me quickly. I realized that\
  \ I am not able to go up and for sure not able to go down. I knew also that if I\
  \ would stay in current position I would fall down next minute. I don\u2019t remember\
  \ how I reached easier area where I saw possible way for climbing up. \nA bit later\
  \ there was one difficult moment but rather save in comparison to the icy chimney.\
  \ \nSuddenly started snowing. So on the extremely narrow top I was afraid having\
  \ only air around and some snow under my shoes. Anyway I raised my hands in a gesture\
  \ of victory. \nI don\u2019t know how I went down. There was slippery and fearfully\
  \ but I did it very quickly obviously choosing different way.\nThat adventure seems\
  \ not scaring me because in the same evening I was thinking about other difficult\
  \ destination for some next days. \nEmotions during the climbing are like a drug.\
  \ One who tried it is not able to stop."
