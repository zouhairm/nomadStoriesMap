Text: "A principle of nomadic painting is noticing variations in culture and environment.\
  \ I had planned travelling from Baroda in West India to the eastern corner of Bengal\
  \ by train. But Diwali, the Hindu 'festival of lights' urged people to celebrate\
  \ the triumph of good over evil with family - so much so that seats were booked\
  \ out for weeks. In disappointment I pealed off many rupees for a flight.\n\nThe\
  \ air yielded surprising perspectives of the two thousand kilometres separating\
  \ Gujarat and Bengal. I saw dust, risen from the deserts, hanging lace-like in the\
  \ air. I saw that it was these thick atmospheres that had trick my eye so that small\
  \ nearby hills appeared huge and far. It is the reverse in Australia, where air\
  \ clarity creates the dangerous illusion of large far-away mountains appearing near\
  \ and accessible. \n\nDown on the plains I noticed riverbeds winding like pale,\
  \ starved serpents, intersected by canals pillaging the water. Glittering against\
  \ the desert dust like stars, thousands of tiny villages revealed themselves and\
  \ I began to grasp the context and geography of India's water wars.\n \nQuite suddenly\
  \ the arid zone became tropical.\nKolkata, green and rainy as Baroda had been brown\
  \ and parched, appeared through pillaring clouds. One steamy day later I and sketchbook\
  \ were wading through monsoonal puddles down Esplanade, that locals call 'Splannat'.\
  \ Many people passed but for once I did not sketch them. It was the period buildings\
  \ that dropped my jaw, so patently did they speak of wealth made when Kolkata was\
  \ Calcutta, the English colonial capital, and India the 'Jewel in the Crown'. \n\
  \nAt Saint Paul\u2019s Cathedral I viewed memorials to the Mutiny of 1857. In Bengal\
  \ butterflies or \"titli\" are believed to be spirit bodies and as I sketched the\
  \ facade I made a note \"many butterflies here\". \nLeaving, I noticed the light\
  \ change. The sky turned amber, brushed here and there with palest blue. Rich, saffron\
  \ light drenched the streets, staining the old buildings, limning their ornamental\
  \ facades. The noise of crowds and traffic faded. Time seemed to slow and a hush\
  \ to fall on Kolkata as this weird and unearthly beautiful state came and passed.\n\
  Splannad returned to its dizzying chaos of shoppers, apparently oblivious to the\
  \ occurrence.\n\nBengalis call this phenomenon \"shonali alo\" - \u2018golden light\u2019\
  . Asking around I am told that it is said that in its light lovers may marry without\
  \ familial permission, tinging my sense of this fleeting event with some measure\
  \ of poignancy."
