Text: "The camel snorts and I struggle for balance praying that the fall will be painless.\
  \ You\u2019re right, Lawrence of Arabia I\u2019m not and this is my first camel,\
  \ presumably the last to suffer the disgrace of carrying me for the endless stretch\
  \ of 100 meters. \nI sway and bob perched precariously on top of this mountain of\
  \ an animal under the merciless Moroccan afternoon sun, putting on a brave face\
  \ and smiling through my teeth as my friend snaps picture after picture of glorious\
  \ mementos. Should\u2019ve stayed with the young velvety foal tied close to a wooden\
  \ post. My hands still carry the imprint of its soft hair while struggling to hang\
  \ on to its mother\u2019s reins. Some day I\u2019ll look back and remember all this\
  \ with the sepia tones of memory, another touristy snapshot.\nWe\u2019re not the\
  \ only bus today as Spanish coaches often cross the sea to deliver weekend tourists\
  \ like me, ready to experience Morocco on the go: a two-day trip to discover a culture\
  \ and a people it took others ages to describe. \nI can still remember the sudden\
  \ decision, the race through the noisy Sevillian streets to deliver our documents\
  \ to don Miguel of the tiny travel agency. Noon on Friday, and then boarding the\
  \ coach where we\u2019re destined to be an oddity as the only English speaking blond\
  \ heads in a sea of darker hair and more colorful clothes. So far, the infectious\
  \ and boisterous \u201CDonde estamos? En Africa\u201D chorus of a lively South-American\
  \ group has us hooked.\nAs the finish line approaches and my camel seems to hasten\
  \ its steps, I dare ask myself: Is it possible to get a genuine feel for a geographical\
  \ space and people over such a short time? \nYet, I have the taste of the sea on\
  \ my lips and a sunny picture of the Gibraltar guarding our passage to Africa, the\
  \ quiet majesty of the morning sunrays bathing the water and the tiny boats hurrying\
  \ to their Saturday morning fishing as seen from my hotel terrace only hours ago.\
  \ \nAnd yes, I tentatively pat my behemoth, I\u2019ll remember you fondly as well.\
  \ You\u2019ll live forever, and so will the beaming smile of the shop attendant\
  \ girl returning my shy \u201CShokran\u201D, or the blue walls of  Chefchaouen and\
  \ its blinding contrast to the barren rocks of its scenery. \nI won\u2019t bother\
  \ to remember the \u201Cdance of the seven veils\u201D staged for our merry group,\
  \ but I\u2019ll keep a place in my heart for the stolen image of a woman cleaning\
  \ a modest house on a regular Sunday, with the strains of a nostalgic song coloring\
  \ her movements. \nFinal shot: close up, Morocco."
