Text: "On our first morning, I woke to gunshots. Two staccato pops followed by a hesitant,\
  \ searching third, the kind of the shot taken with either the utmost care or regret.\
  \ Not what I had expected, but then, I hadn\u2019t much to go on outside of a watered\
  \ down cultural brief and my own cursory regional research. I rose from my bunk,\
  \ waving off my staff sergeant as his eyes halfheartedly offered to leave the warmth\
  \ of his sleeping bag, and pad barefoot through the abandoned room alongside our\
  \ barracks, and onto the patio to investigate. \nIt is the first time I had laid\
  \ eyes on Sakartvelo, the Republic of Georgia, a country roughly the size of West\
  \ Virginia housing three times the population, in the light of day and it did not\
  \ disappoint. Eastern greys gave way behind me, bathing Akhaltsikhe in warm pinks\
  \ as it too awakened. Roosters and dogs raised an impressive din, crows giving impetus\
  \ to the howls of the latter. As I would later find out, this was partially the\
  \ cause for my early revival; stray dogs are present throughout the country and,\
  \ while the Americans never tire of them, the native soldiers are less than amiable\
  \ to their presence on base. \nSitting twenty miles north of the Turkish border,\
  \ Akhaltsikhe is a small city of about 50,000 and the capital of Samtskhe-Javakheti.\
  \ This southwestern border state of . As part of the joint NATO forces descending\
  \ on the small nation as part of Exercise Agile Spirit 2017, our mission was to\
  \ reaffirm ties with our European allies while impressing upon the Russians the\
  \ kind of men and material we could mobilize in short order. I expected to accomplish\
  \ this, and not much more. \nBy the time we left, we, a platoon of Marine tankers\
  \ from Idaho, groaned to leave. We had drunk wine from aft caps with our Georgian\
  \ counterparts atop the ramparts of Rabati, a 9th century fortress that withstood\
  \ siege by Tamerlane before Constantinople fell. We had clamored through the caves\
  \ and tunnels of Vardzia, an entire city carved into the stone of Erusheti Mtn in\
  \ the 12th century that served as a base of operations for the great Georgian queen,\
  \ Tamar.  There, on the banks of the Kura River, chasing down the salty heat of\
  \ khachapuri acharuli- an incredible Georgian bread bowl of cheese, butter, and\
  \ egg- with Georgian pilsener, we gazed up at the pock-marked cliff face much as\
  \ the Mongols must have done. \nThose moments, awash with cheer, the smooth edges\
  \ of history, and friends new and old, were worth far more than any military objective."
