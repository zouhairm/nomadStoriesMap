Text: "When people think of hot springs, they imagine a relaxing, luxurious spa day.\
  \ The words \u201Chot springs\u201D would never conjure up thoughts of a life changing\
  \ moment. However, during a trip to Japan, a dip in a traditional Japanese hot spring\
  \ would be just that. \nIt all started when I booked a group trip to Japan as a\
  \ graduation present. I always credited myself as being a culturally sensitive person,\
  \ open to new experiences, but less than 48 hours into my trip, I was already experiencing\
  \ culture shock. We were to have a once in a lifetime experience at a Buddhist monastery,\
  \ consisting of meditation and traditional cuisine. I was thrilled until we were\
  \ informed of one little caveat. Apparently, we were to experience another Japanese\
  \ tradition--the onsen, a traditional hot spring where clothing in any form is believed\
  \ to contaminate the water and is thus prohibited. Yes, I was to bathe in my birthday\
  \ suit in front of a group of girls I had just met. The cherry on top? If we wanted\
  \ to bath at all that day, it would have to be at the onsen, since there were no\
  \ private bathing facilities at the inn we were staying. It wouldn\u2019t be an\
  \ issue anywhere else, but in the hot and humid Japanese climate, daily showers\
  \ are a must to preserve sanity. For those ever planning on visiting Japan, I highly\
  \ recommend avoiding the month of August for that very reason. \nI was convinced\
  \ I was going to pass on this activity, but when I saw that nearly everyone else\
  \ decided to go for the plunge, no pun intended, I did as well. One is expected\
  \ to shower beforehand, so I wasn\u2019t going to get away with jumping in quickly\
  \ and hiding myself under a blanket of steam. I bore it all for the first time in\
  \ my life. I realized most of the other girls were nervous too, as bathing with\
  \ strangers was a foreign concept to them as well. It was then that my nerves dissipated.\
  \ That moment of terror turned into a moment of liberation. I let go of my uptight\
  \ American opinion of nudity. It was the last thing I expected. I felt free and\
  \ comfortable in my own skin, something I had never felt before. That experience\
  \ set the tone for the rest of the trip, where I would try everything no matter\
  \ how intimidating it may look. I even voluntarily partook in every onsen opportunity\
  \ we encountered, growing quite fond of the Japanese tradition. Who would imagine\
  \ that a single moment abroad could have a life altering impact on one\u2019s views?\
  \ It\u2019s always a challenge to step out of one\u2019s comfort zone, but in the\
  \ end it is always rewarding."
