Text: "After several personal setbacks I want to set my soul free. \n\nI have been\
  \ completly dependent on the working system for the last 11 years and I am only\
  \ 32 years old, and it has stopped making sense for me. I want to connect with myself\
  \ and the world. I want to show there is more to life than work from 9pm to 5pm.\
  \ People can be creative in their way of living and invest more time on life itself.\n\
  \nThrough my travelling I want to inspire many others struggiling to live outside\
  \ the system.\n\nI want to inspire myself and those who I will connect with along\
  \ the journey.\n\nMy story will be about human beings, connection and a vision of\
  \ the world free of prejudice and filled with interest and compassion.\n\nI want\
  \ to tell the stories of the people I meet through out the days, and I want to share\
  \ all that I spiritually gain from them.\n\nI want to grow and help others grow\
  \ by sharing, caring and connecting.\n\nI still have some characters left by I wouldn\xB4\
  t be adding more than the essential which has been said.\n\nThis is a turning point\
  \ for me, and I find this opportunity perfect to start the new journey.\n\nThank\
  \ you\n\nBest Regards\n\nJoana"
