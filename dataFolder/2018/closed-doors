Text: "It was almost midnight when I arrived in the capital after a 7 hour bus ride.\
  \ I walked to the metro, but couldn\u2019t buy a ticket since the machine took coins\
  \ and I had not a single one. There was fear and tears and frustration, but with\
  \ no other option, I hopped over the gate and ran down the platform and onto the\
  \ next train that came. \n\nThe metro stop I got off at was desolate and almost\
  \ completely dark, and walking outside gave me no respite. There was graffiti on\
  \ every building around, rubbish littered everywhere and groups of men leering at\
  \ me. I was relieved to only walk a few blocks to my room, but there I found a locked\
  \ door with no answer. I knocked and knocked to no avail. Footsteps up the stairs\
  \ gave me hope, and I was pointed in the right direction- another building 2 blocks\
  \ away. I finally was able to relax when I laid my head on the pillow. \n\nI knew\
  \ my time there in the Eternal City would be brief, so I had to pick just a few\
  \ things to do. The Vatican should be one of them, right? I found out that the Pope\
  \ would be doing a sermon the following day, so I rose with the sun the next morning\
  \ and made my way there. I approached the large gates just as they were closing.\
  \ I just sat down on a nearby curb, and all of a sudden the gates re-opened and\
  \ they let just a few of us in before closing them again. \n\nThe Vatican was breathtaking\
  \ and overwhelming, like St. Peter was there himself, guiding me inside. Up the\
  \ stairs I stumbled into hundreds of people, and felt chaos instead of the calm\
  \ I was expecting. I realized the seating was through a doorway to the right, but\
  \ the doors began to close. I turned to go up towards the other side where I could\
  \ still see a door open, but it quickly closed too. Then there were barricades being\
  \ put up, right in front of me. \n\nAnd then it happened; the doors opened, and\
  \ out walked Pope Francis himself. I was mesmerized for a moment, and couldn't believe\
  \ what was happening. He came right to me as if I was the reason he had made his\
  \ appearance, the look of love and true joy in his eyes. I could feel his energy\
  \ from 20 feet away.\n\nI sat there in the back of that hallway for the next hour,\
  \ eyes closed and a true smile in my heart. Listening to prayers that were of a\
  \ religion that I did not associate with, preached in a language I could not understand.\
  \ It didn\u2019t matter. All of those closed doors were worth the chance to see\
  \ that last one open, and absorp what was revealed. Isn\u2019t that what life is\
  \ about?"
