Text: "I had visited Bali with my wife during last October.Bali is called as \u2018\
  Island of the Gods\u2019 due to the presence of numerous temples.But I felt that\
  \ the friendly & kind local people made the place seem even more divine.We experienced\
  \ their kindness & warmth on the very first day itself of our trip.Our onward flight\
  \ to Bali arrived at night & we reached our villa at Ubud after 10 pm.When we enquired\
  \ about dinner, the owner Wayan initially informed us that their restaurant has\
  \ closed & that all the staff had already left.We were famished & did not know what\
  \ to do.But Wayan came back soon to our room to tell that his wife Ayu is preparing\
  \ Mee Goreng for us & also told that they are offering it free of cost.We were really\
  \ touched by this sweet gesture.On our last day in Bali, Wayan & Ayu gifted us a\
  \ lovely pair of couple bracelets with colored beads.When we read about the Mount\
  \ Agung volcano eruption a few months ago, we even mailed Wayan asking about the\
  \ situation there & were glad to know that everything is fine.\nWayan's cousin Nyoman\
  \ was our driver for all of our trips in and around Ubud.Nyoman was a friendly and\
  \ cheerful person.Interactions with Nyoman helped us to learn more about Balinese\
  \ culture.Some of the things which we got to know from him are \u2013 i)Each Balinese\
  \ family has a family temple, ii)Crime rates are very less in Bali because Balinese\
  \ people believe strongly in Karma, iii)Rice is the main crop in places like Ubud\
  \ while vegetables & strawberries are cultivated in hilly areas.He also mentioned\
  \ that Ubud used to be a small village with only paddy fields & it later developed\
  \ into a small town because of tourism.On our last day in Bali, Nyoman told that\
  \ he also has a villa business.While he was dropping us to the airport, we helped\
  \ him to create a Facebook page for his villa using the Facebook app on his phone.\n\
  We observed that a lot of Balinese people love Bollywood movies and songs.At multiple\
  \ places, the local people asked about Bollywood & Shah Rukh Khan when we said that\
  \ we came from India.Another similarity with India is that rice is an integral part\
  \ of Balinese cuisine also.A typical Balinese meal consists of a portion of meat\
  \ served along with rice and vegetables.Pork Ribs and Crispy duck were my favorite\
  \ dishes.We watched the amazing Kecak dance performance near Uluwatu temple.Kecak\
  \ is a Balinese dance form which is based on our Indian epic Ramayana.\nIn short,\
  \ Bali has a fascinating culture and also has some connections with Indian culture."
