Text: "When i was in High School i was not the perfect student, i was a normal one\
  \ with normal grades and normal performances. But then, the last thing i expected,\
  \ happened! \nI come from a really hot and crowded city and I have always loved\
  \ to travel, meet new people, get to know their ways of thinking. \nWhen i was 9\
  \ my parents sent me to a study holyday in northern italy by myself. The first 5\
  \ days i cried a lot but then i got familiar with it. The next year I left again\
  \ and I spent the first 5 days crying, again, but then i got familiar with it....\
  \ again. \nI took these kind of study holiday from when i was 9 until i was 18 going\
  \ abroad too and if there is something I have learned from it is that YOU GET FAMILIAR\
  \ WITH THINGS.\nThis certainty made me take a decision that pushed me to the edge.\
  \ \nIn my 4th year of I school i had a scholarship that allowed to go to the United\
  \ States for 6 months. \nPrecisely I went to Lee, which is probably the smallest\
  \ town ( if it can be diefined as \"town\") on earth. \nCold and desolation, but\
  \ a lot of realx. That's how remember that place. And even if I used to say I hated\
  \ that place when i was there, I have to admit i miss it sometimes. \nThe places\
  \ we travel to sometimes get into our heart and never go away. But it is not the\
  \ place itself but the whole experience you lived there. \nWhen I was in the US\
  \ i turned 18, which in my country is a really important age, the age that turns\
  \ you into an adult. \nI spent my 18th birthday by myself, people there were not\
  \ really lively and social. But I decided to make a present to my self. \nI bought\
  \ plane tickets. From Lee to NYC then to Miami then to Los Angeles then to Las Vegas\
  \ and then back to Lee, and everything in 11 days. \nWhen I proposed this travel\
  \ plan to the few friends i made there they thought i was crazy, or that i was going\
  \ to get lost or robbed. \nBut I mede it through. In that travel I met a lot of\
  \ people from different countries. They all contributed to enrich my experience.\
  \ I visited a lot of places. I was by myself but never felt lonely."
