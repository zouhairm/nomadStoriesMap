Text: "\u201CKon\u2019nichiwa Ohayo gozaimasu , Arigato\u201D my ears picked up the\
  \ words . Oh ! after all the adventures , missed flight at Delhi, fights with  the\
  \ airport authorities and a prolonged stay at New Delhi I had  landed on the Buddha\u2019\
  s land, \u2013Japan. My dreams had forced me to chase this dream to visit\u201C\
  Hiroshima\u201D.  \n  And here I am at Hiroshima  after  an exciting Sanyo Shinkansen\
  \ Bullet train journey. My middle class mind kept poking me at everything. I was\
  \ shocked by the speed of the train 230 to 300 kph. Oh my! It went like a rocket\
  \ leaping in the sky. I just kept looking at it with widened eyes.  I had covered\
  \ 301.5 Km within just one hour and thirty minutes.  The flashback of covering same\
  \ distance in more than 12 hours somehow made me feel sad. The Comparatist and the\
  \ middle class teacher in me were spying on everything. \n My knowledge of Hiroshima\
  \ was just whatever glimpses I could get through History books. I remember my History\
  \ teacher explaining world war and the \u2018little Boy\u2019 dropped on Hiroshima\
  \ and the aftermath. Here lies the seed of my dream to visit Hiroshima.\n After\
  \ dropping my luggage in the hotel  Urbain Hiroshima Executive , I stepped out on\
  \ the roads of Hiroshima. I was walking on the roads not expecting to see the old\
  \ Hiroshima but certainly wanted to trace the reminiscences of the \u201CLittle\
  \ Boy\u201D. To my surprise, the city was with modern buildings, bridge connecting\
  \ roads, technology, vehicles and people with everlasting spirit. Yes that was the\
  \ least thing that I had expected. \n The museum, A-Bomb Dome and the peace memorial\
  \ changed something in me. In the Museum, I was listening to the story of how \u201C\
  \ little boy\u201D was dropped on Hiroshima and what happened within few seconds,\
  \ my eyes were observing the photographs, the clothes, the watch, the tricycle ,\
  \ and so many things. I was trying to feel the pain , the anguish and the sorrow\
  \ that  people had undergone years ago. I started questioning myself , what made\
  \ these people rise again above the adversity, the pain and the sorrow? Is war necessary?\
  \ The place had helped me to find my existence, a process of vertical transformation\
  \ had happened. Visiting a place is always horizontal but transformation is horizontal.\
  \ I was so stupid to consider day today things as  problems  and kept on crying\
  \ over trifle matters.  I was sitting under a tree in Shukkeien garden with a heavy\
  \ heart. The whole experience had not only silenced but transformed me. The little\
  \ girl in me had grown up now. The city had brought about complete transformation\
  \ in me."
