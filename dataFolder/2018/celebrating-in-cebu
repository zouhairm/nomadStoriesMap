Text: "Having already spent a day in Cebu, I was aware that it didn\u2019t have much\
  \ to offer me. Many people travel to Cebu, but they head directly to the resort\
  \ complexes and remain isolated from Cebu proper. The Cebu I encountered was far\
  \ from a tropical paradise; it was gritty, downtrodden, and unwelcoming. When I\
  \ found myself back in Cebu upon my return from the tarsier sanctuary of Bohol Island,\
  \ I was resigned to spend the spare hours prior to my departure at the Ayala Mall.\
  \ It would be my birthday at midnight. Cavorting around a mall in Cebu promised\
  \ to be a disappointing way to close out my 43rd year.\n\nIn reality though, the\
  \ mall offered all I needed to comfortably spend several hours. There were bookstores\
  \ and coffee shops. There were restaurants and bars. Most importantly, there were\
  \ hygienic bathrooms featuring operating toilets with the seats unremoved. Eventually\
  \ I ended up at The Social, an open-air bar located on the top floor, and ordered\
  \ a San Miguel. It was here that I met Blue. Little did I know at the time that\
  \ Blue was to ensure the last evening of my 43rd year would be indeed memorable.\n\
  \nBlue was a Panama Jack hat-wearing Filipino tax lawyer. Upon first meeting him,\
  \ it was evident that I wouldn\u2019t soon forget him. He was an animated, curious,\
  \ and welcoming individual, and he wasn\u2019t alone; he was accompanied by his\
  \ much younger girlfriend. Being in his sixties, Blue explained that his thirty-year-old\
  \ girlfriend was younger than his daughter. Fittingly, she was also the proud curator\
  \ of the website SugarDaddyForMe.com. Blue proved to be a Cebu nightlife aficionado.\
  \ It wasn\u2019t a surprise to learn he had once owned a girlie bar there. I thought\
  \ it would be fun to run around Cebu for a night with Blue. I was about to get a\
  \ glimpse of what it would be like.\n\nBlue suggested we go to another bar to sing\
  \ karaoke and I didn\u2019t hesitate in agreeing. Off we were, out of the mall,\
  \ and on to a karaoke bar. Only it wasn\u2019t a karaoke bar at all; it was a swanky\
  \ hotel bar frequented by what limited bourgeois society Cebu possesses. This was\
  \ not the Cebu I had been previously exposed to. The bar didn\u2019t have a karaoke\
  \ machine, but rather a musical duo on stage. Blue gets what he wants, though, and\
  \ he wanted to sing a duet with me before I was off to the airport. At 11:50 pm,\
  \ during the final moments of my 43rd year, I crooned California Dreamin\u2019 on\
  \ stage with Blue backed by two live musicians. By midnight I was in a taxi bound\
  \ for the airport. How could I have ended the year any better?"
