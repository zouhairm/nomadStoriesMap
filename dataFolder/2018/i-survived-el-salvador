Text: "Many travelers bypass Central America\u2019s smallest country for fear of being\
  \ bludgeoned by a gang. Had I heeded the \u201Chype,\u201D I would have missed some\
  \ special sights and Salvadorans. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t listen.\n\nNinety\
  \ minutes beyond the brouhaha of the country\u2019s busy capital lies the quaint\
  \ town of Suchitoto. A chicken bus transported 36 Salvadorans and me there for 70\xA2\
  . It was a rickety, but festive ride. Locals hopped on and off at every stop, selling\
  \ chicle (gum), popcorn and peanuts. Both vendors and passengers had brown hair,\
  \ brown eyes and brown skin\u2014except for yours truly, who sat there with blond\
  \ hair, blue eyes, fair skin and freckles, happy to be hobnobbing with the Hispanics.\n\
  \nThe mountainous air was a welcome change from San Salvador\u2019s smog. After\
  \ a spin through the cobblestone streets of Suchitoto's center, I stopped at the\
  \ whitewashed walls of Santa Luc\xEDa church\u2014long enough to say a short prayer\
  \ (for my life). A tiny bus then took me 10 minutes away to the lake. As I stepped\
  \ off the bus, a boat owner eyed his colleague and smiled. He came toward me, and\
  \ in a carefully constructed English offered a 3-star deal: 40 minutes for $20,\
  \ \u201Cnirly fur free.\u201D It wasn\u2019t the first time I was taken for an American\
  \ airhead. Te equivocas, guapo (Wrong, buddy)! I spit out some snazzy Spanish, with\
  \ an incredibly un-American accent. He surveyed his cigarette butts on the suelo\
  \ (ground), and asked if I was from Spain. It's always the same: I open my mouth\
  \ and the asking price drops\u2014by at least 60%.\n\nAfter my $7 private tour with\
  \ Capit\xE1n Timo, I met a family from Santa Ana. Alberto, In\xE9s, their 10-year\
  \ old twins Javier y Hugo, and In\xE9s\u2019 mom, Mar\xEDa, were celebrating the\
  \ boys\u2019 cumplea\xF1os (birthday). As the boys pummeled the pi\xF1ata, In\xE9\
  s offered me some torta (cake). Hugo then adorably imitated my accent (he knew I\
  \ wasn\u2019t from Spain). Two hours later, Alberto insisted on driving me back\
  \ to town\u2014with me up front and the 83-year old Mar\xEDa scrunched between In\xE9\
  s and the boys in back. I protested, but they stopped understanding my Spanish.\
  \ They wanted to take me all the way to Santa Ana, but the road to San Salvador\
  \ forked the other way. So, I savored another festive ride with the popcorn and\
  \ peanut vendors.\n\nIn the airport, I saw a shirt that said: \"I survived El Salvador.\"\
  \ I thought of Alberto, In\xE9s and the boys. I thought of the passengers and vendors.\
  \ I thought of the boat owner who tried to barter me \u201Cup.\u201D I smiled. If\
  \ that was El Salvadoran \u201Ctorture,\u201D I\u2019d take it again."
