Text: "Stumbling through the labyrinth of viali between buildings of rustic, crumbling\
  \ fa\xE7ades, I searched for the way back. With the crisp, Mediterranean breeze\
  \ of late March at my spine, I scanned my surroundings for something familiar amongst\
  \ the shadows cast by the citron-colored street lamps.\n\nBy contrast, days in this\
  \ nearly 3,000-year-old cosmopolitan city are full of rich culture, vibrant food,\
  \ grand museums, and quaint artisanal shops. I hopped off the train at Rome's Termini\
  \ and immediately felt a sense of accomplishment. With a pocket guide of basic Italian\
  \ phrases, I eagerly made my way out to the street side. The midday sun's warmth\
  \ was a welcomed change to the late-winter chill of home.\n\nAs I explored the sprawling\
  \ metropolis, I was mesmerized by the canopies of stone pine trees and the golden\
  \ reflection of the buildings around me. The evocatively smoky scent of grilled\
  \ artichokes from a caf\xE9 nearby left my mouth watering. Ultimately, I found myself\
  \ at the top of the Spanish Steps gazing westward toward the sunset creeping over\
  \ the horizon. \n\nA bittersweet sigh escaped my lips as my first day in Rome came\
  \ to a close. The night was young and at my hostel's advice, I ventured out to enjoy\
  \ the Roman nightlife. In the Testaccio district, a dance club by the name of L'Alibi\
  \ called to me. The distressed building with wrought iron window guards draped in\
  \ budding ivy greets a lively, mixed crowd. An evening of Aperol Spritz and dance\
  \ music was just what I needed.\n\nPushing my way out to the dusty, cobblestoned\
  \ road, I was ready to retire. My walking map didn't show where I was, but instead\
  \ of panic, I was oddly confident in finding my own way. However, the self-assurance\
  \ of a few too many drinks quickly wore off and I was lost.\n\nNot a soul in sight,\
  \ I sat on a curb defeated with my head in my hands. A short time passed and a gentleman\
  \ in a timeworn, red Fiat 500 pulled up adjacent to me. He shouted something in\
  \ Italian and pointed in my direction. I stood and started to walk away not wanting\
  \ trouble, but he called again as if he wanted to help. He exited his car and pointed\
  \ to the glowing screen of his phone. I approached him and in beautifully broken\
  \ English, he asked, \"You need taxi?\"\n\nWith a smile and a handshake, he ensured\
  \ my safe departure. Although we didn't speak each other's language, I felt an unspoken\
  \ connection. As I reflect on his kindness, it has made me a better global citizen\
  \ by helping tourists in need at home and abroad."
