Text: "Why Crete still talks to me\nIf I had to pick another surname, could be Dedalus,\
  \ taken obviously from Stephen Dedalus of James Joyce. As every time I go somewhere,\
  \ I observe the people living; I take the back streets to find out voices mixed\
  \ with daily noises. This is real to me, intact from tourists\u2019 hordes. In Crete,\
  \ the real thing is more than inspiring. Here, meeting the locals is a kind of routine.\
  \ It is part of the ritual for them to stand you two or three shots of homemade\
  \ raki. According to the tradition, everybody has a cousin or uncle who is a local\
  \ producer; this guarantees the good life back to the basics. \nThis time, my destination\
  \ was Chania, both the main land and the port. In the morning, I visited Therisso,\
  \ the birthplace of Eleftherios Venizelos\u2019s mother, 16km outside of Chania.\
  \ I took pictures of its ravine, the one and only in Crete that can be crossed by\
  \ car (very relaxing experience, believe me). Immediately over there, the fresh\
  \ mountain air worked me up to start talking to the locals. After five minutes\u2019\
  \ talk, I realized that old women were married with match-makings, coming from a\
  \ nearby village, Meskla. The sympathetic Calliope offered me some raki, while narrating\
  \ stories from their family tavern. I bought a precious bottle and, before saying\
  \ goodbye, she gave me another good tip about Cretan Dittany; this botany mixed\
  \ with mountain tea cures the stomach. It was wise to buy some. \nAfter the short\
  \ tour in Therisso, I went to the port of Chania. I went to the Navy museum and\
  \ then my intuition picked some of the traditional and so picturesque narrow roads\
  \ of the city. I saw even tiny \u201Cstivania\u201D, traditional Cretan leather\
  \ boots, for children, hanging in the shadow. All of a sudden, I ran across colorful\
  \ pots and a kitten lying on the floor, next to autumn fallen leaves. It was a matter\
  \ of time to meet the soul of the place, Michalis, the young potter. He explained\
  \ the whole process to me. I noticed his foot-warmer, due to the cold outside. However,\
  \ Michalis was very descriptive. First the wheel comes; then the pot must dry for\
  \ three days, be put in the oven for 12 hours up to 1000 degrees, become cold to\
  \ be decorated with colors and furnished with glass looking like caster sugar. Dipped\
  \ in the water, it stays in the oven for other 12 hours in 40 degrees. When it is\
  \ cold, it is finally ready. \nA Russian proverb says you need just six handshakes\
  \ to succeed. I say only two people can make your trip successful to take good memories\
  \ home."
