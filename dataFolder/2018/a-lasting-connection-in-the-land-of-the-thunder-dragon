Text: "Bhutan holds an inaccessible, almost mystic appeal in many people's imagination.\
  \ Steeped in tradition, and with tourism closely controlled, it can be hard to connect\
  \ with locals in more than a superficial way. That's why a moment last year was\
  \ one of the most special I can remember. \n\nI was on a long day hike from the\
  \ town of Paro to the stunning Taktsang (Tiger's Nest) monastery. Rather than taking\
  \ the usual approach, I opted for a longer, more strenuous route via Bumdra monastery,\
  \ up at 4000m. \n\nBumdra, also called the Cave of a Thousand Prayers, was founded\
  \ by 100,000 angels in 1692. It is a collection of tiny rooms half hewn from rock,\
  \ half perched on a cliff. It overlooks a broad, grassy ridge covered with white\
  \ prayer flags fluttering in the constant breeze, beyond which lie deep valleys\
  \ and snow-capped peaks. Its site was chosen by Guru Rinpoche, who brought Buddhism\
  \ to Bhutan, and whose image is seen in temples across the Himalayas.\n\nThe lone\
  \ resident monk invited me and my guide, Rinzin, in. As he showed us round, Rinzin\
  \ was visibly moved just by being in a room where Guru Rinpoche had once prayed.\
  \ This was clearly a very special place. The monk then offered us food and tea.\
  \ Humbled by his generosity, we offered our snacks, and batteries for his transistor\
  \ radio in exchange. We got chatting, with Rinzin translating from Dzongkha to English.\
  \ Just the day before, I'd learned about a Buddhist prayer expressing a wish for\
  \ all feeling beings to be happy, well, at ease, in a state of bliss, and free from\
  \ suffering. I asked him about it. \n\nSomething in the monk's eyes fired up, the\
  \ talk took a deeper turn, and our connection grew. As we parted he not only wished\
  \ us a safe onward hike, but said he would pray for Rinzin's and my rebirth as lamas.\
  \ From a person who had chosen to forego material comforts in favour of solitary\
  \ spiritualism, this was perhaps the most moving and deeply meaningful thing he\
  \ could possibly have offered.\n\nIn such simple yet beautiful surroundings, this\
  \ short conversation and had a profound effect on me, and lingers in my thoughts\
  \ to this day. Bhutan and its people don't have to be experienced at arm's length\
  \ or through a camera lens. A bit of curiosity, effort, and time to pause can create\
  \ connections through which its seemingly magical qualities truly sink in. I didn't\
  \ 'find myself', but I did find a window onto an elusive part of the world, coming\
  \ to appreciate a way of being with others that I now take with me everywhere I\
  \ go."
