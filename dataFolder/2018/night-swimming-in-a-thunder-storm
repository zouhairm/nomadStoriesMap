Text: "My best friend and I, when together, love making bad decisions. It's a curse\
  \ we have, there's something that makes us push ourselves when we are in each other's\
  \ company. \nWe had long dreamed of running away to some tropical paradise together\
  \ and parading around the streets like locals in long, swishy dresses, barefoot,\
  \ with the smell of the sea in the air and after many years of scrimping and saving,\
  \ we finally got together enough money between us to book a holiday in the summer\
  \ before we were to move away from each other for university. After much debate,\
  \ we decided upon Croatia as our destination, I'd always wanted to do the wall-walk\
  \ around Dubrovnik and witness the stunningly clear waters surrounding it for myself.\
  \ Our hotel was majorly swanky, with several restaurants within it, a spa, it's\
  \ own beach and two swimming pools. Spending our days exploring, we'd sneak through\
  \ the hotel lobby late at night to take advantage of the outdoor pool. The pool\
  \ closed every evening at 6pm but by midnight nobody was there to tell us no - we\
  \ had the entire place to ourselves. It was quite a spectacle under the shroud of\
  \ darkness; the pool was surrounded by colossal, prehistoric-looking trees that\
  \ loomed over, leaving a clearing in their canopy that exposed the naked night sky\
  \ and the thousands of stars twinkling light-years away. Every now and then you'd\
  \ see a shadow swoop down over the water - dozens of bats trying to catch the moths\
  \ that had emerged during nightfall. This was our ritual, every night we would pack\
  \ a towel and traipse along the path, through the forest to the pool. One evening,\
  \ we had spent some time in the bar drinking cocktails when a storm rolled in. Somewhat\
  \ tipsy from our pi\xF1a coladas (and realising we'd very much like to get caught\
  \ in the rain) we ran to get our swimming costumes on and headed for the pool. By\
  \ the time we got there, the storm was right overhead and the lightning silhouetted\
  \ the trees against the night sky. Understanding that night-swimming on a hill,\
  \ in the middle of a thunderstorm was probably a terribly dangerous decision, we\
  \ convinced each other to do it anyway and in the torrential downpour, swam out\
  \ into the middle of the pool as thunder cracked, ringing out across the ocean.\
  \ It was terrifying and exhilarating. Although unlikely, we knew there was a chance\
  \ lightning could strike the water but that's what made it so exciting. That feeling\
  \ of danger made it feel like I was closer to the edge than I'd ever been before."
