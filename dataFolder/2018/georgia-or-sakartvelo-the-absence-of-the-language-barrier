Text: "I was walking alone in Tbilisi in the middle of July. I was purposely getting\
  \ lost in the quirky, dilapidated, and magically charming streets of an old city.\
  \ \nThe tall man, with smiley wrinkles and friendly handshake, was selling cherries\
  \ from the back of his car made back in the Soviet Union times. We immediately involved\
  \ in a conversation. He invited me to meet his friends. A second later I was in\
  \ the living room surrounded by curious and excited Georgian people who wanted to\
  \ know everything about me and were sharing their stories. We were eating ripe juicy\
  \ cherries from the backyard tree, Suluguni cheese, dried figs paired with freshly\
  \ brewed Georgian Coffee.  \nSomeone suggested sightseeing while the sun was still\
  \ high. Just half an hour later my brand new hosts were driving me to the Mtatsminda\
  \ mountain to get the best view of the city. My entire being was dissolved and carried\
  \ away, with a story they were telling me of an old Tbilisi or Tiflis. The king\
  \ Vakhtang Gorgasali moved the capital here from Mtsheti after the discovery of\
  \ the natural hot sulfur spring in the 5th century. I learned that the name Georgia\
  \ came about together with the USSR invasion of the country. The true name that\
  \ the locals refer their country to is Sakartvelo. \nLater, we went to eat dinner\
  \ at the restaurant they suggested. We shared hot khinkali and the wine aged in\
  \ a terracotta vessel named qvevri. Steamed Khinkali were made in onion clove dumpling\
  \ shape, with cumin and black pepper spiced brothy lamb stuffing. The wine made\
  \ from the Kisi grape varietal with dried apricot, walnut, wilted tarragon, and\
  \ baked clay aromas paired perfectly with Khinkali. \nI thanked my friends after\
  \ the dinner was over. We hugged and walked away from each other. I learned so much\
  \ about the country in just a few hours from sightseeing and sharing food with true\
  \ locals. \n \nNone of us spoke the same language. \n\nThe passionate hospitality\
  \ of my new friends, that  I will never see again, created flowerless communication\
  \ through smiles, handshakes, hugs and welcoming intentions."
