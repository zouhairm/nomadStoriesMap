Text: "You don't exactly Google the location you want to visit when traveling in Cuba,\
  \ you simply go there. Who knows, it might not even exist anymore. We were finishing\
  \ our ten day trip around the western part of the Island and Santa Clara was our\
  \ last stop. \n\nI'd read about El Mejunje out of blind faith and pure curiosity.\
  \ It had been there for over 20 years hosting one of the richest scenes in Cuba,\
  \ as well as a famous travestite show. In a country where the LGBT community was\
  \ persecuted at the height of the regime, you just ache to enter this oasis of free\
  \ speech. \n\nWe followed our instructions off from Parqu\xE9 Vidal, the main square,\
  \ where schoolkids in white shirts walked with their neatly notted red scarves.\
  \ The garden was circled with old carts pulled by goats and vintage cars showing\
  \ people around the colonially preserved city, its authentic abuelos puffing on\
  \ cigars and the imposing green tower hotel, still scarred by bullets from the day\
  \ Che Guevara and his men conquered Santa Clara. \n\nA few strolls further was our\
  \ stop, discreetly melted into the decor, the doorway to another Cuba we couldn't\
  \ expect. Loud music was playing in what appeared to be the centre of the building:\
  \ the remains of an old hotel which had romantically collapsed to reveal trees growing\
  \ in its heart. Casting a warming shadow on the scene, the sunset colors and the\
  \ brick walls contrasted with all the men and women in black. I heard buzzing sounds,\
  \ strong laughs and the air rieked of pure rum as pints of it where being poured\
  \ on the floor as they danced. \n\nWe had landed in the middle of a metal concert,\
  \ spanish lyrics were being rougly cast into the mic and I felt like traveling through\
  \ a 90s music video\_: headbanging and pushing each other without tearing up the\
  \ way-too valuable merchandising t-shirts. Soon I was chatting in broken Spanish\
  \ with the remaining sober Punks, they told me they were celebrating the anniversary\
  \ of one their friend's death, five years back. A few feet away his widow was getting\
  \ his portrait tattooed on her thigh, not minding the sweaty and thick carribean\
  \ air. \n\nI let myself totally go and grabbed the paint markers I had brought with\
  \ me in my bag, leaving a souvenir on the brick floor to draw my thankful mood.\
  \ Quickly everyone leaned towards me and took a pen of their own. In a few minutes\
  \ I was looking over a newly crafted nonsense of colored signatures and sketches,\
  \ a spontaneous call to share, a cry for expression and freedom. \nI'll be back\
  \ with more ink."
