Text: "I\u2019m invited to go to Aruba with a friend who\u2019s been going every year\
  \ for as long as she can remember. It\u2019s a place I associate with monstrous\
  \ cruise liners presumably spilling out orange skinned tourists there to purchase\
  \ gold by the pound or resorts better known for bingo than food which, honestly\
  \ is a big part of what motivates my travels. I\u2019m skeptical, but it\u2019s\
  \ February in NYC + my seasonal depression is full blown so I book a flight. \n\
  My drive from the airport to the resort is peppered with chains: Pizza Hut, Starbucks,\
  \ KFC confirming my fears. It\u2019s possible my friend has a spidey sense about\
  \ these things because she greets me with cocktail upon arrival. At least there\u2019\
  s rum + sun. A few hours spent on the beach blissing out to the sound of waves +\
  \ palm fronds + digging my toes in the soft sand and my resolve is renewed. Also,\
  \ I\u2019m hungry. Friend tells me she knows about a waterside place that serves\
  \ fried fish +  beer called Zeerover. We just have to find it. It\u2019s not Pizza\
  \ Hut so I\u2019m game and we get on the road. \nAfter an hour, a few stops to ask\
  \ locals for directions and what seems like the 5th time we\u2019ve driven down\
  \ the same road, we see it: \"Zeerover\" scrawled on a weather worn banner. We join\
  \ a line that\u2019s a bit longer than I anticipated. Good sign. There\u2019s a\
  \ menu of 5 items: catch of the day, pickled onion, fried plantains, cornbread,\
  \ fries. It\u2019s perfect. Wahoo, Barracuda, Kingfish, plump shrimp as big as your\
  \ thumb all caught that morning from the small fishing boats lining the docks which\
  \ make up the al fresco dining room. We scoop up a table by the water which here\
  \ means I\u2019m dangling my feet over a dock, dipping them into the crystal clear\
  \ Caribbean waiting for our fish to get fried. Our food arrives heaping in a plastic\
  \ bowl the color of the sea, simply fried, a few lime wedges on the side + a bottle\
  \ of the islands local papaya hot sauce.\nI think about the Michelin guide: 1 star\
  \ for \u201Ca very good restaurant in its category\u201D, 2 for \u201Cexcellent\
  \ food worth a detour\u201D and 3 for \u201Cexceptional cuisine worth a special\
  \ journey\u201D. Given this criteria, Zeerover is ostensibly + unexpectedly a three\
  \ star Michelin restaurant. I\u2019ve vowed to return to Aruba for a \u201Cspecial\
  \ journey\u201D, dragging friends with me, ripping past the tourist mecca of Orajenstad\
  \ to Zeerover chasing the perfection of this place. How often do we truly happen\
  \ upon perfect experiences that put us in touch with our humanity? It doesn\u2019\
  t happen at KFC I don\u2019t think. But it does at Zeerover."
