Text: "I have never really been alone. Yes, I went a year abroad to the United States.\
  \ Yes, I am staying in Bangkok right now. And yes, technically, I was by myself\
  \ back then and sometimes even now. It never felt that way, though. But now? My\
  \ heart started beating faster and faster. I took a deep breath and clicked on the\
  \ flickering button, saying \u201CBook flight\u201C. \nSo here I am. Sitting in\
  \ my bed in Bangkok where I decided to study about three months ago, booking a trip\
  \ to Lombok, Indonesia, and freaking out. Literally.\n\nA couple of days later I\
  \ sat in one of the pink cabs I got to know so well during my time here in Thailand;\
  \ with just my bagpack to hold on to. I still didn\xB4t know why I was so nervous\
  \ about this trip. It always seemed magical to me to just go any place I\xB4d like\
  \ to. Being free to make a decision all by myself. And now there I was catching\
  \ up with my spontaneousness. I shook my head repeatedly, trying to let go of my\
  \ fears. \nThe skyscrapers and street kitchens flew by the taxi\xB4s window and\
  \ blurred to a single mass. \nWhy cant I just be happy? I have always wanted to\
  \ go to Indonesia and especially: I have always wanted to learn how to surf. And\
  \ now there I was on my way to fulfill both of my dreams at the same time and, instead\
  \ of feeling excited,  it only made me feel alone. In my head, I pictured turquoise\
  \ water. I could almost feel the warm white sand in between my toes on the way to\
  \ the shore, my surf board clamped under my right arm. Yes, this was really it.\
  \ This would be me in less then 20 hours. This was a reason to be happy \u2013 and\
  \ to smile. \nMy heart finally started to relax and I subconsciously smiled, looking\
  \ forward to both, catching waves and sun. \n\nAfter four hours on the plane and\
  \ a restless night in Kuala Lumpur\xB4s airport, trying to sleep on the floor, I\
  \ slept with my head lying on my bagpack before finally landing in Lombok.  I felt\
  \ like I had won over myself. Like I was the hero of my own story. \nIt did take\
  \ quite a long time to get used to the thought of being on my own. But eventually,\
  \ I realized just when stepping out of the airport into the torrid heat, I had made\
  \ the right decision. I had challenged myself to come here by myself, not knowing\
  \ anyone nor the language. \n\nAll I had known was that, to me, giving up never\
  \ was an option. We sometimes need to overcome fears and obstacles to become a stronger\
  \ person. But that trip to Lombok had helped me to get out of my own way. It opened\
  \ my eyes to a greater, more beautiful world."
