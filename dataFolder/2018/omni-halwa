Text: "We ate Omani halwa at the Quriyat police station. Sweet and spicy, it was served\
  \ as a large gooey blob that we dug into with bare hands.\n\nIt was a welcome hit\
  \ of energy as I tried to explain how we (three Australians and a French woman)\
  \ came to be soaking wet, with our car stuck in a flooded canyon, at 9pm at night.\n\
  \n\u2018Why did you go in there?\u2019 the chief of police Fadi asked.\n\n\u2018\
  We\u2019re rock climbers,\u2019 I said. \u2018We were climbing in the canyon.\u2019\
  \n\nHe frowned slightly as we tried to explain what rock climbing was.\n\n\u2018\
  Okay,\u2019 he interrupted. \u2018You go up, but then what? Why climb the rocks?\u2019\
  \n\n\u2018For fun?\u2019\n\n\u2018Didn\u2019t you see the water?\u2019\n\nWe had\
  \ driven into a wide canyon two hours south of Muscat. Driving until there was too\
  \ much water to continue, we had hiked and waded to the climbing area, inexplicably\
  \ oblivious to the slowly rising water. We hadn\u2019t realised that since our climbing\
  \ guidebook was written, the largest dam in Oman had been built at the top of the\
  \ canyon.\n\nWe finally grasped the situation when returned to our car at dusk and\
  \ saw it a foot deep in water. We had gathered our essentials, swum out in the dark,\
  \ and called the police to ask what to do about our car.\n\nWhen we finished at\
  \ the police station, Fadi insisted on taking us to stay at his home. We apologised\
  \ for causing so much trouble.\n\nThe next afternoon we ate hunks of meat, covered\
  \ in spices and cooked a pit oven for 24 hours. It was Eid al-Adha, the Muslim feast\
  \ of sacrifice, and the manager of the dam insisted we join him for a traditional\
  \ meal. We sat around the vast communal platter of rice and meat, eating with our\
  \ hands.\n\nFor the next three days we were fed, housed, and invited for endless\
  \ cups of tea with Fadi\u2019s teenage daughters. I felt guilty, anxious that Omani\
  \ culture meant people felt obligated to look after careless foreigners like us.\n\
  \nOn the fourth day the water had dropped enough that we were able to retrieve our\
  \ car. I was sure everyone would be relieved to see us go.\n\nEight men from the\
  \ police station, the water ministry, the dam, and some of their friends, came with\
  \ us. At the canyon entrance they sat in a circle on the rocks making tea over a\
  \ small fire and eating dates, their long white tunics impossibly clean.\n\nOne\
  \ of the younger men, Arif, asked what our plans were next. I said we would go to\
  \ Wadi Shab.\n\n\u2018Good.\u2019 He gestured at two friends, \u201CWe'll come with\
  \ you. We'll get fish to bbq.\u2019\n\n\u2018We'll have lunch at my house first,\u2019\
  \ cut in Fadi. \u2018My daughters would like to say goodbye.\u2019"
