Text: "Trying to find my way out of the airport a bony, middle-aged man approaches\
  \ me.\"Taxi, Miss?\", he mumbles timidly. It is not his words but the sparkly, lentil-shaped\
  \ eyes what instantly raises my attention. They shine with something very rare -\
  \ happiness.\"Why not\", I say with no hesitation. \n\nAt first sight Yangon appears\
  \ quite different to other Southeast Asian cities. Looking out of the half-open\
  \ car window, streets are fairly neat, not too crowded and they enjoy absence of\
  \ motorcycles. I take a deep breath without being choked by fumes. I guess I am\
  \ going to like it here.\n\n\"How's life in Yangon?\", I start a conversation with\
  \ the taxi driver.\"Yes, very good!\", he replies and there is not a hint of doubt\
  \ in that 'yes'. He continues in a broken English: \"My daughter..university..engineer..government\
  \ psys..but my son is naughty..no school\" and he laughs candidly. \"My wife happy..so\
  \ me happy also\", he keeps on laughing. Indeed, he looks happy. Eyes don't lie\
  \ and his ones smile with happiness.  \n\nI am truly amazed at Yangon's character.\
  \ Walking down the central lanes, no one hassles me or tries to sell me anything.\
  \ I hold on my handbag, constantly checking on it, but to my surprise there is not\
  \ even one attempt to get into my private space. I am becoming suspicious. Why is\
  \ everyone behaving so strangely normal?\n\nSuddenly, I notice many friendly faces\
  \ looking at me with the same eyes of the taxi driver. I return their smiles, say\
  \ hello and at the same time I feel embarrassed.\"Me-a Western fool, so ridiculously\
  \ mistrusting and narrow-minded\", I am shamefully thinking to myself. I keep strolling\
  \ around, now with more relax.\n\nThe streets of Yangon are filled with vendours,\
  \ young boys playing soccer and marron-robed monks; none of them seems worried or\
  \ sad (and they could be). On the contrary, the 'local eyes' spread peace, even\
  \ those of hungry street dogs. I sense harmony.\n\nAlthough I stand out I somehow\
  \ feel part of the city.People passing by me smile and they all own those cheerful\
  \ lentil-like eyes shaped by vitality.The good vibes must be contagious since I\
  \ catch myself smiling too.Getting lost amid the maze of golden pagodas and greeting\
  \ the folk with friendly 'mingalar bar',I have embraced Yangon.I feel close and\
  \ connected to the world around me.\n\nA few weeks have passed, I look in the mirror\
  \ while brushing my teeth and I notice something odd in my face. Is it really a\
  \ couple of new lines around my eyes and mouth? Perhaps I have been smiling too\
  \ much lately.."
