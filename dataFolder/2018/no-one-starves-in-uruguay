Text: "The sky was that same perfect blue again in Montevideo that morning, as I walked\
  \ down to the corner coffee shop. I liked the corner coffee shop, even though the\
  \ coffee wasn't great. Every morning for five mornings, passing the same street\
  \ vendors, the same stray dogs, the same boys parking cars, and the same people\
  \ asking for money, along the Rio de la Plata, with the horizon meshing the blue\
  \ of the sky with the silver of the river, only interrupted by the slight haze of\
  \ Buenos Aires on the other side.  It was easy to fall into tread with this city.\
  \ No one knew me but everyone smiled at me.\n\n There were stalls in the street,\
  \ though not as many as usual for a sunny day. Standing alone was a stall of hats.\
  \ The woman selling the hats smiled and met my eyes, \u2018Buen Dia\u2019 I said\
  \ shyly.\n\u2018Buen dia,\u2019 she replied, with a tilt of her head, \u2018your\
  \ eyes are like the colour of the sky today.\u2019\n\u2018Thankyou\u2019 I said,\
  \ feeling my face blush at the unexpected compliment. I stopped at the stall to\
  \ have a look, picking up two hats nervously, knowing I would have to use my terrible\
  \ Spanish to buy something. \u2018You can have two for one,\u2019 said the woman.\n\
  \u2018No no, how much for two?\u2019 I replied.\n\u2018Two for one for you, the\
  \ woman with the blue eyes,\u2019 she insisted. \n\u2018Thank you,\u2019 I said\
  \ earnestly. \u2018Have you sold many hats today?\u2019 \n\u2018No, it is quiet\
  \ today,\u2019 she said with a slightly solemn tone.\n\u2019Perhaps people are all\
  \ at the beach?\u2019\n\u2019Perhaps.\u2019 There was a slight pause between us,\
  \ and I wondered if she had a quota she had to meet.\n\n I asked her if she lived\
  \ near by, and she nodded. \u2018Yes with my husband and three children, and two\
  \ or three other families most of the time,\u2019 she replied casually. She lived\
  \ in the Old Town, which was full of old ruined mansions. Many were ruins, inhabited\
  \ by squatting families and pigeons.\n\u2018That must be.. busy,\u2019 I said.\n\
  \u2018Yes, it is like this in many places in Montevideo. We will have to go somewhere\
  \ else soon. But we always find somewhere.\u2019\n\u2018Oh\u2026\u2019 I said, not\
  \ knowing what else to say.\n\u2018But it\u2019s ok\u2019, she said quickly, feeling\
  \ my awkwardness, \u2018no one starves in Uruguay. On the days I sell lots of hats,\
  \ I buy a big piece of meat, and cook stew for all the families. We will eat for\
  \ two days from one pot of stew. We had a pension, but that stopped. Someone else\
  \ must have needed it more than us.\u2019\n\nI said that I would come and visit\
  \ her the next day. \u2018I\u2019m glad you stopped to speak to me,\u2019 she said.\
  \ In my country would there always be someone to buy the meat and make the stew?"
