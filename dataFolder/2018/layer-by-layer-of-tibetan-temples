Text: "\u201CWhy is she on the floor?\u201D I wondered as I strolled along the street\
  \ in Lhasa. I leaned closer and saw that the lady was praying. She knelt, put her\
  \ palms together towards her chest and bowed. Then she stood up and repeated the\
  \ actions. Again and again, inching nearer the temple several meters away. \u201C\
  Such a fervent devotee!\u201D I thought. Similar images kept recurring as I witnessed\
  \ more people praying like her, wearing gloves and kneecaps smeared with dust. This\
  \ was my first impression of Tibet: a highly religious community.\n\nThe praying\
  \ outside the temple was an individual, quiet affair. The next sight that greeted\
  \ my eyes was a stark contrast. The temple\u2019s courtyard was filled with pairs\
  \ of monks clad in maroon-colored robes who were debating loudly and gesturing passionately.\
  \ My ears perked up at the sound of a hand slapping another hand every few seconds.\
  \ I traced the source to some enthusiastic monks who engaged their hands in putting\
  \ across their points.  \n\nI could not help but think that they were spurred by\
  \ the presence of an audience. Tourists surrounded the monks but did not cross the\
  \ invisible border to the stage of the \u201Cperformance\u201D. Observing the tourists\
  \ observe the monks was amusing. None of us understood Tibetan but each of us was\
  \ tempted to make up what one monk was saying to the other. Until we grew bored\
  \ with our game and left, to be replaced by the next curious tourist. \n\nConvinced\
  \ of the vital role that religion played in Tibet as I stepped into the temple,\
  \ the last thing I expected was the overt display of a sinful symbol. Real money\
  \ notes were stuffed in every nook and cranny! They were colorful, messy and overflowing\
  \ in some corners. Seeing a monk count stacks of cash made me uncomfortable. Aren\u2019\
  t religious figures supposed to be free from materialism? Flashes of the praying\
  \ devotees and debating monks crossed my mind. I had built up my respect for Tibetan\
  \ monks and this latest spectacle was disconcerting. \n\nAs I ventured deeper into\
  \ the temple, it was full of elaborate deity statues but I got distracted by the\
  \ bills lying everywhere. The other visitors seemed undisturbed by the scene. It\
  \ eventually dawned on me that my struggle was due to the mismatch of my own notions\
  \ with reality. Counting money conjured up my sentiments of greed and need to do\
  \ it discreetly. Perhaps the monks\u2019 open act was a sign of them not having\
  \ my kind of attachment? There are so many more layers of Tibetan temples for me\
  \ to peel off."
