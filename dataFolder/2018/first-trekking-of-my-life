Text: Hello everyone my name is rahul rai and I'm 22 years old and I'm from India
  I live in varanasi and it's very hot climate here I've never see any mountains in
  my life or a temperature below 5 degree Celsius. ..but I always wanna do trekking
  and see mountains and snowfall and u know all natural things which I never seen
  before actually it's my dream to spend one night on the top of mountain and to do
  trekking and to see snowfall and this dream becomes true in December 2017 me and
  one of my friend abhishek decided to go and experience all those things which we
  never experienced in our life so we make a plan to go to himachal pradesh in India
  which is the most beautiful state of India u can see mount everest from there and
  it's too cold over there so we took a train from Delhi to kalka and we reach kalka
  by midnight and we have toy train in morning around 6am from kalka to shimla one
  of the best place in India and capital of himachal pradesh and it was our first
  time in toy train so we were so excited to travel in toy train we didn't even sleep
  whole night cuz we don't wanna miss our first toy train so we decided not to sleep
  . And finally in morning we r in toy train it's a train 6 coaches and not so wide
  and it goes so slow cuz it's going in upward direction on mountains and believe
  me once u sit in toy train u will experience the best view of ur life we saw the
  sun rising from behind the mountains and lots of mountains. Then we went to hotel
  which we booked and took a shower and then we r ready to see shimla there was a
  the ridge from where u can see all mountains and sit and chill around and there
  u can see the church which is 100 years old then we move towards jakhoo temple which
  was like 8 km trekking from the ridge and when we reached jakhoo temple we won't
  believe on our eyes it has 108 ft tall statue of hanuman ji ..then we again back
  to hotel and rest cuz next day we r leaving for manali from shimla. Next morning
  we packed our bags and finished breakfast then we took a bus to Manali we reached
  Manali by evening and it was 25 December Christmas day so trust me Manali looks
  like a heaven on earth so we booked a hotel and decided to relax in night and it
  was first time when we experienced the temperature in - 6 degree so whooah it was
  nice experience for us next day we took a bus and decided to go to sollang valley.
  when we reach sollang valley trust me u will feel like u r in different planet.
  Must come to these two beautiful cities of India
