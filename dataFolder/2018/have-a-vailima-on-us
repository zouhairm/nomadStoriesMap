Text: "\u201CAnother pig!\u201D I pointed.\n\nMy partner, James, led me down a grass-covered\
  \ road. There were potholes, wild pigs and oddly pristine gardens. We were in Upolu,\
  \ Samoa.\n\nWe were on a mission to buy bottled water and a bar of soap to cart\
  \ back to our fale. A brightly coloured convenience store stood ahead. As we grew\
  \ closer, our brisk pace slowed \u2013 it looked deserted. \n\nJames recalled a\
  \ national tradition involving napping all afternoon.\n\n\u201CThe horn we heard\
  \ \u2013 it\u2019s because the stores were closing.\u201D\n\nWe grudgingly turned\
  \ to go, feeling the intense heat. \n\nWe\u2019d made it just a few metres down\
  \ the road when we heard a shout.\n\n\u201CHey!\u201D\n\nA 30-something man was\
  \ rushing towards us from a neat house across the street. He looked like he had\
  \ something important to say.\n\n\u201CI will open,\u201D he pointed at the store.\
  \ \u201CBut you must have Vailima (beer) with me and my wife.\u201D\n\nHis name\
  \ was Charlie. His wife, Hannah, was weaving a basket outside with a kitten curling\
  \ around her ankles.\n\nI recalled a few comments I\u2019d read on Samoa\u2019s\
  \ tourism website. \u201CSamoans are friendly,\u201D it had said. \u201CIf you join\
  \ people in their fale, the whole town might come along.\u201D\n\nWe made plans\
  \ to see Charlie and Hannah the next day, when we were a little less jetlagged.\
  \ Charlie made us swear that we would come. We bought our water and soap.\n\nThat\
  \ night, we made some new friends over a bottle of American Honey \u2013 Michael\
  \ and Georgina. They were an English duo living in New Zealand. He was an electrician\
  \ and she a teacher. We invited them for Vailimas, and they agreed in a heartbeat.\n\
  \nA trek along the now familiar potholed, coconut-dotted ocean road led straight\
  \ to our destination. Hannah was waiting for the bus outside. We had come to realise\
  \ that the bus came when it chose \u2013 or, as our fale owner said, when the bus\
  \ driver\u2019s girlfriend had finished putting on make-up.\n\nCharlie exited the\
  \ open door.\n\n\u201CJames!\u201D he greeted us warmly \u2013 he really seemed\
  \ to adore James -  before waving a hand and inviting us in.\n\nHe seated us at\
  \ the table, dragging chairs from different rooms. He cracked open a cold beer for\
  \ each of us, talking about his sister, his wife and his children. Then came the\
  \ Samoan card game, which none of us really, truly understood. We showed him Snap.\
  \ He didn\u2019t like it.\n\n\u201CWelcome to beautiful Samoa,\u201D he said. The\
  \ partially collapsed wall behind him revealed a pristine, private beach that belonged\
  \ to two lucky people."
