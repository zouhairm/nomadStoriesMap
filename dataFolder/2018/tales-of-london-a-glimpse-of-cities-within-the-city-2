Text: "In the 2500 words given to me,I want to give you a tour of London and a glimpse\
  \ of places beyond the British borders.I won\u2019t take you to the Big Ben,London\
  \ Eye,the red telephone booths and the crowded Picadilly Circus.In the words left,I\
  \ want to tell you about the time I went to Shoreditch with my Turkish friend to\
  \ see art spray painted on every wall in every street,some elaborate,others modest,but\
  \ telling a riveting story nonetheless.The delicious Neapolitan pizza in the Shoreditch\
  \ market reminds me of my Italian friends and that barbecue party where they enjoyably\
  \ taught me Italian swear words.They told me stories of Sicily and Milan while we\
  \ had dinner at Aqua in Shard and we walked back home singing \u2018Sorry\u2019\
  \ by Justin Beiber at the top of our voices.I had only heard of the warm vibrancy\
  \ of the people from Italy,but was fortunate to have found pieces of Italy in London.I\
  \ also stumbled upon a little bit of Peru when my Peruvian friend turned guide and\
  \ took me and my friends from Turkey and Milan to Ceviche in Soho to give us a taste\
  \ of Peruvian food where we tried Nuestro Secreto with cocktails,Chilcano and Pisco\
  \ Sour.It was art,both on plate and palate.\nAll my days were abuzz,abounding with\
  \ energy.One day,I\u2019d get drunk on wine with friends from Madrid,Mallorca and\
  \ Istanbul,and we\u2019d dance our way back to our dorm.Next day,we\u2019d discuss\
  \ politics in Turkey,in a caf\xE9 in Trafalgar Square,later,getting distracted by\
  \ Lola\u2019s cupcakes and Venchi\u2019s gelato and then ending the day with take-out\
  \ Thai food on a bench on Southbank.One night,a few Londoners taught us crazy dance\
  \ moves in a gay club and when the hustle-bustle of the city was enervating,we took\
  \ a day to sit back and relax over coffee in a boat-caf\xE9 in Little Venice.\n\
  I went to London for summer school and a year later,sitting at my desk,I think about\
  \ the quiet evening in a caf\xE9 in Covent Garden when my American friend introduced\
  \ me to bubble tea and the breakfast at the Breakfast Club in Soho we rushed for,right\
  \ after our final exam.While these memories are running through my head,my mind\
  \ is playing the music played by street performers on the streets and how we listened\
  \ to them in awe while getting late for the Phantom of Opera.My story of London\
  \ is a story of people going beyond the \u2018List of top-10 Things to do in London\u2019\
  \ you find on your first search on Google.Serendipitously,while exploring London,I\
  \ didn\u2019t make a local connection in London alone,but I made local connections\
  \ in cities around the world."
