Text: "The night before we are to fly, I will myself to think of Icarus, who fell\
  \ to his death flying too close to the sun, and is now a cautionary tale of hubris.\
  \ But he had something else on his mind: faced with an interminable imprisonment,\
  \ he chose to escape, trusting an impossible dream, on wings held together by wax.\
  \ Hubris may have killed him, but hope got him to fly. \nHope is what I wanted:\
  \ a desperate plea to the gods above (from an atheist) that everything would go\
  \ fine when N and I took off on our paragliding flight.\nHere\u2019s the thing:\
  \ I have a phobia of heights (technically, it\u2019s more a fear of gaping depths\
  \ such as gorges and river valleys). I can climb hills, I can walk up to the 31st\
  \ floor, but ask me to look down into a great abyss, and you\u2019ll find me scooting\
  \ like the Flash. A jump? That too, off a rugged, vertical drop cliff? Not in my\
  \ wildest dreams. And yet, here I was, peering into the vast valley of Pokhara below\
  \ \u2013 my home, my land. The Fewa lake was never as menacing as in that moment.\
  \ At other times, it is a placid pool, a perfect sunset, a postcard moment. The\
  \ hills of my childhood became death valleys, their ridges sword-edges. It was,\
  \ quite simply, the most terrifying moment of my life.\n***\nMy instructor asks\
  \ me to run down the slope, look straight ahead, and trust in him to control the\
  \ chute. I promise myself I will follow him to the T. When the time comes, I run,\
  \ run until I feel nothing beneath my feet \u2013 there\u2019s a gaping void below,\
  \ then a gentle tug at the harness, and I am being lifted, higher, higher. I am\
  \ flying.\nI am flying!\nIt hits me like a bullet! The magnificent Annapurna range\
  \ beckons on my left. I survey the land, penetrate the morning haze that envelops\
  \ Pokhara. The hills come alive. The lake shimmers like a queen\u2019s thousand\
  \ necklaces. I imagine this must be how eagles see the world, a miniature village,\
  \ a tilt-shifted city. There is no gaping fear of falling; there is only the sky\
  \ and the earth, and in between, me. This is why Icarus died, this is why the gods\
  \ killed him: so that he could never fly again.\n***\nIn 25 minutes\u2013less than\
  \ it takes to order a meal at a mall\u2013I have come full circle. To behold land\
  \ while adrift at sea gives one hope; to plant your feet on solid ground after a\
  \ flight should feel familiar. But it doesn\u2019t. If I were of a religious bent,\
  \ I would probably call it an awakening. Perhaps this is why souls escape to the\
  \ skies. Perhaps flying is the last liberation, the moksha Hindus dream of."
