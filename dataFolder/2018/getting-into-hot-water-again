Text: "One cool October day, I was invited by a Japanese friend to visit an outdoor\
  \ hot spring north of Tokyo. While usually segregated, this was one of the few rotenburo\
  \ where the entire family could bathe together. \u201CYou\u2019re not shy?\u201D\
  \ my friend Ayako giggled. She then assured me that the hot spring would be full\
  \ of octogenarians.\n\nWhen we first arrived, my appearance as a Western woman caused\
  \ quite a commotion. Some starred, others tittered in embarrassment (whether for\
  \ me or themselves wasn\u2019t clear). Outside the larger cities, foreigners are\
  \ rare, and the prospect of seeing one naked even rarer. The fact that I could also\
  \ speak some Japanese added to the excitement, and the senior citizens began to\
  \ buzz with anticipation.\n\nAs prescribed by bathing etiquette, I first showered\
  \ myself and then lowered my scrubbed gooseflesh into the murky pool. Crimson maple\
  \ leaves languidly floated nearby, and a mother playfully decorated her daughter\u2019\
  s shoulders with the colorful leaves. It didn\u2019t take long before my bathing\
  \ neighbors were rapid-firing the usual questions that accompanied me wherever I\
  \ went in Japan Where was I from, how long had I been in Japan, and what did I do?\
  \ True to their hospitable character, my naked interrogators insisted I enjoy their\
  \ dark sweet Chinese tea and rice snacks as we chatted and soaked away.\n\nEventually\
  \ I was left alone to enjoy the still hot waters. Rain lightly patted on the pool\
  \ like a soft lullaby. Japanese voices lilted and murmured around me. Time seemed\
  \ to vanish behind the mist veiling the nearby mountains. \n\nBut then I decided\
  \ to stand up. My neighbors were contently immovable, but I was feeling a bit dizzy.\
  \ Once I nimbly climbed out of the mineral bath, I immediately fainted! Surprises\
  \ had become commonplace during my visit \u2013 the discovery that supermarket labels\
  \ were undecipherable and that pouring soy sauce on my rice was taboo \u2013 but\
  \ the last thing I ever expected was to find myself flat on my back, stark naked\
  \ and surrounded by a crowd of Japanese strangers. Worried faces starred down at\
  \ me. Heads shook with polite concern. \u201CAre you all right?\u201D they kept\
  \ asking. Soon a glass of water appeared, along with cool washcloth and my robe.\n\
  \nIt took me a moment to remember that I wasn\u2019t wearing any clothes! While\
  \ lying exposed, I could hear some of them discussing how \u201Cthose foreigners\
  \ just can\u2019t take the hot water.\u201D Inwardly I groaned. Once again I was\
  \ sure of committing some horrible cultural indiscretion. Only this time in the\
  \ nude!"
