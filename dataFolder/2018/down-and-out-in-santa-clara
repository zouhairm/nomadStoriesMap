Text: "There aren\u2019t a lot of places quite like Santa Clara. Actually I can\u2019\
  t be sure of that, maybe it\u2019s better to say \u2018it\u2019s unlikely there\
  \ are a lot of places quite like Santa Clara\u2019. I haven\u2019t been everywhere,\
  \ but I\u2019ve only been to a handful of towns that felt as otherworldly as this\
  \ one did.\nAllow me to paint the picture.\nI was in the midst of a trip through\
  \ Cuba, about three weeks in, and I had no cash, no cards, no anything. Fortunately\
  \ my mum was able to book AirBnBs for me through Miami, as AirBnb is illegal here,\
  \ although widespread. The AirBnb, or Casa Particular as they\u2019re locally known,\
  \ would give me beans, rice and chicken twice daily, which kept me from starving,\
  \ while the beer I provided for myself.\nSanta Clara is flat and dusty, about midway\
  \ north to south and midway east to west of Cuba. You\u2019d think given its location\
  \ it\u2019d be more than it is, but it\u2019s not. The main plaza has a long abandoned\
  \ cinema, a disused theatre, a bank line ten miles long and an occasional marching\
  \ band playing tubas that look as though they\u2019d been salvaged from the Titanic.\
  \ The main attraction in town is an upended train courtesy of Cuban icon Che Guevara.\
  \ This train would change the course of their revolution and then world history.\n\
  But if Santa Clara had a sense of destiny about it in the heady days of 1959, it\u2019\
  s lost it. For instance it\u2019s the only place I\u2019ve been that employs a system\
  \ of donkeys as the city\u2019s transportation system and roosters as the public\
  \ alarm clock. Entertainment is games of dominoes or marbles adjudicated by disinterested\
  \ street dogs. It\u2019s like going back in time to a time you never knew existed.\n\
  My experience amplified this.\nWithout money or sunshine (I was there just before\
  \ a monsoon hit) and missing the Jack of Diamonds from my deck of cards, I had nothing\
  \ at all to do, for five straight days.\nBut luckily, I made a friend.\nHead west\
  \ on Donkey Carriage Line 1 and eventually you\u2019ll hit a memorial. Staring down\
  \ some 22 feet above you is the timeless and heroic gaze of Che Guevara, made of\
  \ pure bronze. Che is a hero here in Cuba and yet a villain in much of the rest\
  \ of the world, regardless, for five straight days I made the track to see him,\
  \ walk around his memorial garden, visit his resting place, and pay my respects\
  \ for a man who changed the world.\nWhen I left Santa Clara, I missed it immediately.\
  \ Maybe it was Che, maybe it was the donkeys, maybe it was just being somewhere\
  \ so distant from my life back home. It\u2019s a friendship I\u2019ll never forget."
