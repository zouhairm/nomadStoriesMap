Text: "Weeks gone, still eating because I had to, the three meals of a day; still\
  \ couldn\u2019t adapt to the food here. Coming from India where the food is especially\
  \ hot and spicy, my taste buds didn\u2019t conform to the flavors in Taiwanese cuisine.\
  \ \nIt was the only vegetarian restaurant in that countryside I ran every day to,\
  \ a soup noodle shop in fact; four kinds in their menu. I was one among the few\
  \ of their constant customers. My friends joined me sometimes but I didn\u2019t\
  \ want them to eat plain food because of me. Everyday slurping the soup noodles\
  \ while struggling with the chopsticks, I couldn\u2019t stop my brain from wandering\
  \ to that particular day at the airport in India.\n\u201CThere\u2019s everything\
  \ here. Why need to go someplace so far to study. Living in the capital city we\
  \ have every convenience here.\u201D I saw my mother\u2019s heart sink after all\
  \ she said seemed ineffective.\n\u201CDo you like the food today?\u201D a voice\
  \ interrupted my thoughts. It was the old lady of the restaurant.\nThe only thing\
  \ cheerful in that monotonous life was she. With apron silvery white, so untainted,\
  \ a smile so young and bright on her wrinkled face, whenever she greets, filled\
  \ my heart with warmth.\nWatching all the YouTube videos, finally one day, while\
  \ looking around at the department store, I decided to buy stuff for cooking; only\
  \ to realize what big a task it is to cook. A week after several tiring and failed\
  \ attempts, I returned to that restaurant. As I sat there eating the same old soup\
  \ noodles again, a hand caressed my hair.\n\u201CAre you eating well?\u201D I turned\
  \ my head.\n\u201CYou haven\u2019t come since last week\u201D the old lady said.\
  \ \u201CI was worried.\u201D\nWith the widest smile I nodded. She sat beside me\
  \ and watched me eat that day.\nThe food tasted yummier since. I started feeling\
  \ my appetite. After that day, I continued my run but got a new reason to show up.\n\
  She asked me every time if I ate properly; a question only my mother used to ask\
  \ on phone. Miles away from homeland, I found home."
