Text: "The Basilica of St. Francis of Assisi towered over the horizon as our student\
  \ ambassador bus pulled into the walled, Italian city of Assisi, looking as if the\
  \ church itself was trying to feel just a touch of heaven. Winding streets made\
  \ of cobblestone took us closer and closer to the church, the sound of faint hymnals\
  \ getting clearer as we walked through the city.\n\nA quick right turn through an\
  \ alleyway found us outside a brick building with a larger wooden door. Our guide\
  \ knocked twice, waiting for an answer.\nA woman dressed in a habit and black gown\
  \ answered.\n\n\u201CEntra\u201D said the woman, guiding us into the Serafico Institute\
  \ of Assisi, a home and care-center for people of all ages with mental illnesses.\
  \ \n\nThe wood floors of the hallway creaked beneath our shoes, pictures of Saints\
  \ and other members of the Institute hanging from the walls, watching us as we went\
  \ by. We were led though another door that opened to a classroom of children playing\
  \ games, finger-painting, laughing, and smiling. \n\nEach member of our group paired\
  \ up with a child, where I had the pleasure of meeting a little girl named Antonia,\
  \ who suffered from autism.\n\nTaking dampened clay from a pile on the table, Antonia\
  \ worked the clay through her small hands, pulling a piece off and then back together\
  \ again.\n\nAntonia didn\u2019t look up as I sat down.\n\n\u201CCiao\u201D she said,\
  \ setting aside her current piece, and picking up another.\n\n\u201CCiao\u201D I\
  \ said in return.\n\nA classroom teacher walking around the room spoke in Italian\
  \ to Antonia, telling her to share just a tiny piece. Antonia rolled a few pieces\
  \ of clay over to me and I began to mimic the shapes she had been making.\n\n\u201C\
  Grazie\u201D I said. \u201CComo questo?\u201D\n\nAntonia shot a look up at my work\
  \ carefully analyzing each piece I had crafted. She nodded, a small smile forming.\n\
  \nWe worked a bit longer in silence and I realized we were making clay people. After\
  \ working the clay a bit more, I had made only made two clay people to Antonia\u2019\
  s five.\n\nWatching Antonia continue to work-delicately yet with a touch of ferocity-\
  \ made me want to stay working at the classroom for the remainder of the trip.\n\
  \nMore time had passed than I originally thought as our guide told the group we\
  \ had to leave soon to stay with our itinerary. I placed my clay people next to\
  \ Antonia\u2019s, and said \u201CGrazie, Antonia\u201D one last time.\n\nAntonia\
  \ took the last clay person she had been working on and outstretched her hand to\
  \ me. \n\nShe said \u201CPer te.\u201D\n\nFor you."
