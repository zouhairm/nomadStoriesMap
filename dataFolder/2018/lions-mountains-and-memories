Text: "Air horns and chaos, wild driving and fists in the air. Police cars flash hazard\
  \ lights, used like flares on July 4th. The Moroccan National Soccer Team have just\
  \ qualified for the 2018 World Cup. We're heading to Marrakech's Mellah Quarter,\
  \ delayed an inconsequential two hours while the airport staff willed the Atlas\
  \ Lions to victory. \nIt's early and we're drinking mint tea as we await our guide.\
  \ Ibrahim arrives, greeting us with impeccable English, thanking the waiter in Arabic,\
  \ and priming our driver in French. His energy is infectious; he introduces the\
  \ Maltese couple we are to share the day with. We soak up millennia of colorful\
  \ Berber folklore, our guide and the Maltese exchanging accounts of Romans and Moors\
  \ like they share a barber. Ibrahim impresses the modern achievements of his people,\
  \ promotes Sir Richard Branson's investment in the Atlas Mountains, and delights\
  \ in profiling native music producer, Nadir \"RedOne\" Khayat.\nWe park, stretching\
  \ our legs amid a dense Berber Souk. Children march in front, around, and among\
  \ us, big eyes and cheeky grins. Heavy handshakes greet Ibrahim at every turn. We're\
  \ scouring through camera lenses. Ibrahim reemerges with a CD. He's beaming. On\
  \ the album cover he poses with his bandmates. His music plays as we drive to the\
  \ Imlil Valley, a melding of traditional Berber instruments and contemporary pop.\n\
  In jeans and Air Jordans, Ibrahim bounds up hills, and over rock faces, the exertion\
  \ never interrupting his fluid answers and insights. He playfully ruffles the hair\
  \ of children as we pass. They revel in his charisma. Weathered men, returning from\
  \ treks, pull their pack animals to the side as we pass. Hugs are exchanged as the\
  \ imposing mountains watch on. We bask in the spectacle. Descending, Ibrahim promises\
  \ a surprise as kids show off, hurtling down steep stone walls on bikes with no\
  \ brakes. \nA large boulder quickens the pace. 'See it?' he asks. 'There!' He points\
  \ to a worn scribble, a signature in black ink. It reads \"Gaga Was Here.\" Lady\
  \ Gaga had passed through these villages, escorted, of course, by \"RedOne,\" Ibrahim's\
  \ inspiration. We're his audience, the tour his performance, and we remain in the\
  \ palm of his hand all the way back to Marrakech. Another generous hug and he leaves\
  \ us.\nWe walk back to our riad, pausing to watch a crowd of young boys chasing\
  \ a soccer ball and their dreams of representing the Atlas Lions. A month later,\
  \ an image appears on Facebook. Ibrahim is side-by-side with Sir Richard. He beams."
