Text: "\"You should both set an alarm: you two sleep more than the dead.\" \nSo said\
  \ Mrs Wu, the endearing, yet somewhat fussy, elderly hostel owner in that matter-of-fact\
  \ manner that Chinese people do so well. \n\nSituated 175 miles to the southeast\
  \ of Harbin - the provincial capital of Heilongjiang province - at an elevation\
  \ of 5,000 feet and nestled among rolling hills of snow-kissed pine trees, Snow\
  \ Town was to offer us a taste of a Chinese-style wintry wonderland. All we had\
  \ to do was get there. On the second day of the Chinese New Year no less. Chinese\
  \ New Year: the largest migration of people in the world.  \nA bus stood waiting.\
  \ A large white bus that contrasted sharply with the darkness of the early morning.\
  \ It was her fluorescent pink ski salopettes that I noticed first. \n\"Nihao! Wo\
  \ shi Xiao Li.\"  \nSo, this was the Xiao Li who had texted me. Going by mannerisms\
  \ and appearance, this was a local you had seen a hundred times. Pleasantries duly\
  \ exchanged, we climbed onto the bus and past rows of weary-looking people. Our\
  \ \"private car\" snaked its way through the streets of Harbin picking up more people\
  \ as we headed for the train station. Snowy conditions meant road travel would not\
  \ be possible all the way.\n\"Don't be late.\"   \nXiao Li\u2019s parting words\
  \ as we stepped off the bus and into a sea of Chinese tourists. People mountain,\
  \ people sea is the Chinese idiom to describe large crowds of people. Here we were\
  \ at the foot of the highest mountain and in the depths of the deepest ocean. Elbows\
  \ and shoulders and suitcases appeared out of nowhere, engulfing us. The serenity\
  \ of the morning had gone. Dawn may have been approaching but my mood was darkening.\
  \ The hoisting of a yellow flag by Xiao Li as she purposefully strode away confirmed\
  \ it. That little yellow flag bobbing away like a buoy in the sea, truly signalled\
  \ that we were part of... a tour group. As a seasoned, independent traveller, I\
  \ avoided tour groups at all costs. How had I not realised this is what I had agreed\
  \ to the previous night? \n\u201CDuli,\u201D she had said. Independent. The word\
  \ came floating back to me. Now it made sense. Mrs Wu must have been raising objections\
  \ to the travel arrangements her husband was trying to make for us. She had sensed\
  \ we were an independent couple. She was right. I shook my head and lambasted my\
  \ Chinese listening skills and my polite (or was that stubborn?) refusal to clarify\
  \ information as we waddled our way through security and into the ever-increasing\
  \ gaggle of the station."
