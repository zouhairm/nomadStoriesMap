Text: "February 2014. I\u2019m arriving to Southeastern Asia for the first time in\
  \ my life. It\u2019s my first visit to Bangkok as well. The tuk-tuk guy driving\
  \ me from Suvarnabhumi Airport to Khaosan Road tells that we need to go around Democracy\
  \ Monument and I have to pay more. Why couldn't we go straight ahead? \u2013 I\u2019\
  m asking him. Because of revolution and blocked roads, \u2013 he says to me.\n\n\
  I\u2019m coming to the famous Khaosan Road! The atmosphere is so festive here. I\
  \ like these vibes and whole night parties! What a stupid joke about revolution\
  \ the guy said to me? Maybe his aim was just to get more money? Nevermind! The Chinese\
  \ New Year is coming! I should celebrate it on the main street of Bangkok's Chinatown!\
  \ So I get on a boat down Chaophraya river and I come to Yaowarat Road.\n \nIt's\
  \ so beautiful here! Buildings are decorated with red and gold paper lanterns and\
  \ bright dragons' figures. People dressed in Chinese national clothes are walking\
  \ down the street; they are laughing and talking to each other. Some of them are\
  \ sitting at the cafes\u2019 tables along the street and dancing around trucks where\
  \ musicians are playing Thai rock music. Majority of people hold the Thai flags\
  \ in their hands and blow in very loud whistle tubes. This is the best New year\
  \ in my life!\n\nIt's becoming hard to walk further threading my way through the\
  \ crowd. I don't see little cafes' tables on sidewalks anymore. But I can hear someone\
  \ speaking into a megaphone ahead. That should be typical Chinese New Year entertainments!\
  \ I have to go there and have a look! I'm moving further and further in the crowd.\
  \ But at the end of the street I see a lot of people shaking big posters over their\
  \ heads. I understand nothing. Maybe it is a Chinese New Year tradition, at least\
  \ a very strange one!  The crowd is becoming tighter. People don't dance and don't\
  \ laugh around me anymore. They are seriously shaking posters over the heads while\
  \ a man staying on a truck is aggressively speaking into a megaphone.\n\nHaving\
  \ climbed to a big stone on the sidewalk, I see a dense chain of Thai police with\
  \ guns standing in a couple of steps away! Now I\u2019m starting to realise that\
  \ it is not the Chinese New Year! It's the very same Thai revolution the guy told\
  \ me about few days ago! I should get out of here as soon as possible! Hardly, I\
  \ reach a pier and jump into the boat. I'm going to a cafe on Khaosan Road to drink\
  \ a glass of cold tea and to relax. TV is on. All the news is about the hugest protest\
  \ on Yaowarat Road! Happy New Year!"
