Text: "In the midst of a thunderstorm, standing beside a nun and a ramshackle roadside\
  \ hut, rain pours and a man with his shirt unbuttoned rants at me in Romanian. I\
  \ tell the drunk I can only understand English. He starts counting in German. I\u2019\
  m hitchhiking to Bor\u015Fa, Central Romania, to explore painted churches adorned\
  \ with psychedelic iconography. I start praying. The nun shoos the drunk away. Perhaps\
  \ I should pray more often.\n\nA car finally stops. I scramble inside as well, Bor\u015F\
  a bound at last. Our driver is a shirtless man with a crucifix earring. He speeds\
  \ like a rally driver, swerving abruptly to avoid crater-like potholes and cracks.\
  \ The nun gets out in a small town. With her gone, the man cranks up the stereo.\
  \ He chain smokes and honks his horn at passing girls, still crossing himself whenever\
  \ we pass a church. Wizened women spin wool by the roadside. Manure permeates the\
  \ air as horse-drawn carts trundle along the streets. Our car seems to be moving\
  \ faster than time does around here.\n\nThe man stops suddenly in a country lane,\
  \ a place bereft of buildings and people. He gestures for me to get out. I point\
  \ at my crumpled map, at Bor\u015Fa. The man shakes his head. \u201CI go where you\
  \ go,\" I say eventually, motioning for him to keep driving. We end up in S\u0103\
  p\xE2n\u0163a near the Ukrainian border, 99km from Bor\u015Fa, in a paddock bustling\
  \ with people. Next door is a church and cemetery. Apparently this is the Merry\
  \ Cemetery. Rows of bright blue crosses are covered with illustrations and first-person\
  \ poems. One etching shows a man the size of Godzilla getting run over by a tiny\
  \ car, a broad smile plastered on his face. The poems err on irreverent. One mentions\
  \ a man's deceased mother-in-law: \"Try not to wake her up,\" the dead man requests.\
  \ \n\nBack in the paddock several television cameras point towards a roughly hewn\
  \ wooden stage. Hills roll behind it. Roughly 200 people sit on the grass eating\
  \ hot dogs and drinking plum brandy. A philharmonic orchestra and student choir\
  \ are about to perform 12 compositions based on cemetery poems. Night falls. Cellos\
  \ murmur. Thunder rumbles. Blanket lightning strobes. Drums bellow, cymbals crash.\
  \ Sheet music spirals into the air. The choir erupts. I look skyward and ponder\
  \ what poem may be etched onto my cross. Perhaps: \"He died by the zap of a lightning\
  \ fork, limbs a-flailing too fried to talk\". If lightning struck me now, then perhaps\
  \ I\u2019d join the ranks of the Merry Cemetery. No doubt my charred remains would\
  \ smoulder in poetic peace."
