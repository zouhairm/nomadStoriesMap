Text: "Japan had never felt more otherworldly than that December 31, wandering the\
  \ temple grounds in the dark, searching for the path up to the mountaintop amid\
  \ the New Year festivities.\nOkayama\u2019s Saijo Inari is, in fact, both Buddhist\
  \ temple and Shinto shrine. That night, the open space before the main hall teemed\
  \ with local Japanese families, friends, and couples, gathered to see in the new\
  \ year. Other foreigners and tourists were scarce to be seen in this out-of-the-way\
  \ temple-shrine in a relatively unknown prefecture. Incense, smouldering in enormous\
  \ bronze bowls, fragranced the air. \nLeaving the bustle, we joined the small stream\
  \ of people flowing behind the temple, entering a maze of small paths that wound\
  \ through the woods and up the mountainside. The lights of the hall were no longer\
  \ visible, and the noise of the crowd became a distant murmur. We had the feeling\
  \ of entering a secret and sacred space far removed from the celebration behind\
  \ us. \nIt was an hour until midnight.\nWe walked along the uneven trails, guided\
  \ by the voices ahead and by flaming torches stuck in the ground. The ringing of\
  \ the temple bell, soft conversations, and frequent laughter resounded through the\
  \ darkness. Strangers greeted one another with a cheerful \u201Cyoi otoshi o\u201D\
  \ \u2013 Happy New Year.\nAs we climbed higher, the torches diminished, but so did\
  \ the forks in the path and the trees overhead. We walked in the moonlight until\
  \ the shadow of the mountain receded beneath our feet, revealing an open sky and\
  \ a summit lit by the flickering glow of a bonfire. Sat around it were six men:\
  \ three young and three old. The two groups were strangers to each other, as we\
  \ were to them, brought together by the occasion and the warmth of a fire. \nWe\
  \ shared smiles and limited conversation in fragments of English and Japanese. Until\
  \ the new year began we talked a little, sang a little, and smiled more. Other figures\
  \ hovered around us: dark shadows that drifted close, lingered, and drifted away\
  \ again, like the proverbial ships in the night. At midnight, the nine of us celebrated\
  \ together: \u201CAkemashite omedetou!\u201D \nI barely remember the sleepy descent.\
  \ Our new friends stayed by the fire, maybe to wait for the first sunrise, considered\
  \ lucky in Japan. I told myself that I would return to Saijo Inari to explore it\
  \ by the light of day, but I never did. It remains in my memory as a liminal, dreamlike\
  \ place at the threshold of years, obscured by night, partially illuminated by flame.\
  \ Perhaps that is how it should be."
