Text: "She didn\u2019t expect to be taken seriously. So there she stood, bungee cord\
  \ tied tightly to her, toes curling round the cliff. All she had wanted to do was\
  \ relax whilst she travelled. But the tour guide took her joke on bungee jumping\
  \ off cliffs seriously. \nSo there she stood, hair tied back into a braid, lips\
  \ dry and cracked and her knees shaking like never before. Whether it was from the\
  \ cold or her nerves she couldn\u2019t tell, but the instructor slapped her on the\
  \ back and gave a hearty laugh. \n\u201CYou\u2019ll love it kid.\u201D \nShe gave\
  \ a hesitant, nervous chuckle as she gazed out into the horizon. It was truly a\
  \ beautiful sight, one that deserved to be appreciated. But she couldn\u2019t appreciate\
  \ the sight right now, not in the way that she wanted to at least. She was far too\
  \ filled with trepidation. \n\u201CHey, before you go, what\u2019s your name Miss?\u201D\
  \ \nNever taking her eyes of the horizon, she yelled out over the roaring winds.\n\
  \u201CKiona.\u201D\n\u201CMitch. Everything\u2019s set, now jump!\u201D He yelled\
  \ back, before placing a hand on her left shoulder and pushed. Kiona let out a loud\
  \ scream as she fell, terror replaced with excitement. A grin etched itself on her\
  \ face. \nHeart pounding in her chest as she dropped hundreds of feet down, blood\
  \ rushing to her head. She never realised how exhilarating it was to just\u2026\
  \ fall. \nShe never would have thought about bungee jumping before, not in a million\
  \ years. But her she was, thanks to a sarcastic comment she made to her travel guide.\
  \ She was going to have to give him a fruit basket or something as thanks.\nTime\
  \ seemed to last forever as she fell, but it was only a matter of seconds in reality\
  \ before the bungee cord went no further and she bounced in the air a few times\
  \ until she stopped. Swaying upside down in the air with only the support of a cord\
  \ both terrified and excited her.  Kiona let out a couple breathy laughs as she\
  \ admired her upside-down view of the world before her. The clear blue sky against\
  \ the ocean, with its waves splashing against the cliff. Her astonishment at the\
  \ concept of falling from the cliff and bouncing mere meters from the surface of\
  \ the ocean had never crossed her mind. But thinking it over, she would happily\
  \ do it over again, if only to jump off herself and not be pushed.\n\u201CARE YOU\
  \ OKAY DOWN THERE?\u201D\nKiona looked back at the top of the cliff, seeing a small\
  \ figure, Mitch the instructor, leaning over the railing to look at her.\n\u201C\
  YES! I\u2019M ALRIGHT!\u201D She yelled back, her voice filled with happiness. She\
  \ couldn\u2019t wait to do this again."
