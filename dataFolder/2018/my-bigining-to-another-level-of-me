Text: "It was only meant to be a 4day 3 night camping trip that turned into a huge\
  \ road trip to Tasmaina with an empty suitcase I had to start my life all over again.\
  \ It was the 22dec 2017 when I parted to take the drive  to the beautiful capte\
  \ tribulation with three other English back packers whom I met on a blueberry farm.\
  \ They invited me along for the drive and so I took the invitation and never looked\
  \ back.. we stayed at th PK jungle lodge it was cheap and had everything we needed\
  \ for a comfy Christmas camping trip I taught the tribe to open coconuts and even\
  \ picked up rubbish on Christmas\u2019s day alongside the beach. It was an amazing\
  \ feeling! From there we took off and hit the road on the 26th of dec to head to\
  \ mission beach which is south of cairns and a 4 hour drive from cape trib.. we\
  \ found a cheap campsite at Bingle bay which had all the basic necessities and was\
  \ right on the beach front, lucky for us it wasn\u2019t busy! So we where fortunate\
  \ to have it to ourselves! \nso one night at bingle bay and then moved on to Townsville\
  \ and camped 40 mins out of town in the small town of Balgal which is also located\
  \ on the beach front but free 48 hour camping with beach showers Avilable and toilets,\
  \ did I mention it\u2019s a great place to fish as well I caught myself some beauties\
  \  whilst I was there.. I\u2019ve made so many stops to get to Tasmaina  and had\
  \ lot of ups and downs but it was worth it! it opened me up to realise how strong\
  \ and independent I can be when faced with issues that may disrupt any persons personal\
  \ journey! I left the group of three and took the solo flight once we reached  the\
  \ Sunshine Coast and from there I\u2019ve Breen traveling alone finding my own campsites\
  \ along the road and planning my own day filled with hiking and driving and attempting\
  \ to sleep with one eye open because the fear of been vonrable kept me on my toes!\
  \ I\u2019ve met so many wonderful humans whom Ive taken into my tribe and thank\
  \ the unitverse for accompanying me in my solo journey of finding me! it\u2019s\
  \ taken me a month to travel from cape trib to Tasmaina and I\u2019ve learnt and\
  \ found so many things that have inspired me to get on the track of visually sharing\
  \ my journey with everyone and letting them know through my words and images how\
  \ exciting a new or old place can be if they just changed their prospective and\
  \ open up to new possibilities of journeying beyond the comfort zone... I want to\
  \ share more of what I\u2019ve experinaced for I know the struggle of breaking the\
  \ fearful barriers.."
