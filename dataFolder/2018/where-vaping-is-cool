Text: "In most cities, entering a dark alleyway at night is usually not in my best\
  \ interests. However, New Zealand's capital city, Wellington, is one of the safest\
  \ cities in the world. When going down said alleyway, instead of being mugged, beaten\
  \ and stabbed, you will probably find a cocktail bar, a craft beer brewery or a\
  \ specialty cafe.  \n\n400 000 hippies reside at the bottom of the North Island\
  \ and at customs you MUST hand over any right-wing or conservative mentalities in\
  \ your possession. Many support the belief that owning an electric cigarette, a\
  \ skateboard and at least one tribal tattoo should be strictly implemented onto\
  \ any persons trying to get a 'Working Holiday Visa'.\n\nI come from a large city\
  \ in Australia, where vigilant Trump supporters are not uncommon and riding a push\
  \ bike is a federal offense which citizens take upon themselves to prosecute, usually\
  \ by shouting 'get off the f***ing road'. When first setting foot in Wellington,\
  \ I was taken aback by the disgraceful politeness and open mindedness people have.\
  \ Making local connection in the most progressive city in the world is not only\
  \ easy, but unavoidable.\n\nI scurried down Cuba Street, jumping from bush to bush,\
  \ trying to remain out of sight of the hippies, luring in the many cafes and alternative\
  \ medicine stores. But like the singing of a siren, I could not restrain myself\
  \ and was intoxicated by the smell of freshly roasted coffee. It was too late. I\
  \ had sprung the trap. A draft of vape-smoke appeared and out of it came a man wearing\
  \ overalls, 'John Lennon' sunglasses (though it was overcast and windy) and a 'Pink\
  \ Floyd' t-shirt.\n\nSeeing my backpack and generally clean outfit he immediately\
  \ knew I was a tourist. He introduced himself as Troy and asked me where I was from.\
  \ I told him I'm was visiting from Australia (later to find out this information\
  \ should be kept secret in New Zealand, as well as making sheep jokes). Troy was\
  \ a very friendly native and he took it upon himself to convince me that Wellington\
  \ is the greatest city in the world.\n\nHowever, I was skeptical. Grudgingly, I\
  \ followed him further down Cuba Street, where he showed me the Bucket Fountain,\
  \ voted as Wellington 2nd most notable monument: a misaligned, rusty, steel fountain\
  \ that splashes water down the street day and night. After taking me to his favorite\
  \ craft brewery, he had caught me in his net. The taste of golden lager made me\
  \ imprint on Wellington and I left with my very own pair of overalls and a cast\
  \ of craft beer."
