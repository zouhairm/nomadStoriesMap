Text: "I spent one of the best weekends of my life in a beautiful wooden cottage,\
  \ perched on a hill, in the middle of an apple orchard in Naggar, Himachal Pradesh.\n\
  \nThe 20-minute walk from Naggar city to my local host Sham's cottage is quite picturesque,\
  \ there are snow-capped Himalayas on the opposite side and there's a stream running\
  \ below which makes a beautiful sound which complements the scenery. As you approach\
  \ the cottage, you can see the apple orchard below. The cottage itself is a rustic\
  \ three-floor wooden structure with a green tin roof.\n\nUpon entering the cottage\
  \ I received a very warm greeting from Sham's Alsatian pup Zoro. There was also\
  \ an intimidating white cat, Alfie, who kept Zoro under her control by slapping\
  \ him with her paw. \n\nAfter I freshened up Sham prepared some delicious pahadi\
  \ mutton, a local delicacy, post which we checked out his wonderful fruit wine collection\
  \ and I decided to try an apple wine he recommended. Over the course of the day,\
  \ I found out that Sham is an avid traveller and his love for Himachal was a gift\
  \ he got from his father who dreamed of living in an orchard there some day. I was\
  \ pretty intrigued by his tales of Spiti and Ladakh (he referred them as the most\
  \ magical hills in India) and by his love for landscape photography, in fact, I\
  \ even managed to get a few lessons from him. Very rarely does one get a chance\
  \ to meet someone who has a contagious zeal for life like Sham and that reflects\
  \ in the way he tells his stories, so while I hadn't really stepped out yet I already\
  \ knew I was in for a great vacation.\n\nI woke up early next morning and decided\
  \ to take a small walk to the stream below. Zoro, showing a fair bit of concern,\
  \ decided it was his duty to escort me. It was his area after all. We took a small\
  \ detour through the forest ahead before going down to the stream, at which point\
  \ Zoro decided I must chase him, so there we were a small local pup being chased\
  \ by a young man who was slowly realising exactly how unfit he was. We returned\
  \ after about two hours completely muddy and dripping wet from rolling around in\
  \ what little snow was left from the previous night's snowfall. It was absolute\
  \ bliss.\n\nI spent the rest of my stay exploring Naggar and having light-hearted\
  \ discussions with Sham. This trip is very special to me since this is where I realised\
  \ that travelling for me wasn't a race to cover everything, but a chance to meet\
  \ and bond with people (and puppies) from various walks of life"
