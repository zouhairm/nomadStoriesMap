Text: "I remember sitting in English class, it was probably year 9 or 10. My best\
  \ friend and I were dreamers, thinking of the day we\u2019d make it to America and\
  \ spend months road tripping. We had to be 21, of course. Because what was the point\
  \ of going to America if we couldn\u2019t experience it all. Over the next few years,\
  \ we talked, we fought, we went our separate ways, and eventually, as all friendships\
  \ did, became best friends again. We were inseparable. Until the day that I fled\
  \ the nest, and back halfway around the world. Long distance friendships are hard.\
  \ But  we always had The American Dream keeping us together. One day we would see\
  \ it all. Go everywhere. And we talked, we planned, we dreamt and became realists.\
  \ And then it happened. We flew from opposite sides of the world, meeting in Boston.\
  \  The first few days were easy. After 18 months of not seeing my best friend, we\
  \ were happily reunited. Then it all started to fall apart. Ask me before I left\
  \ how it thought it would finish, and the reality was total opposite.\n\nLong term\
  \ travelling is hard. When you\u2019ve gone from not seeing someone for 18 months,\
  \ and growing as a person, it\u2019s hard, especially when they haven\u2019t had\
  \ that level of self-growth. The reality spending every waking (and sleeping) moment\
  \ with someone is tough when you haven\u2019t seen them in person for so long. We\
  \ fought, we argued, eventually stopped talking. I\u2019d happily spend the day\
  \ wandering around a city, getting lost, walking for miles. Whereas she missed her\
  \ car, the ease of driving around \u2013 and daily public transport wasn\u2019t\
  \ in my budget. Ultimately the differing budget caused more arguments.  We argued\
  \ on the way to Times Square, where I had to talk her from going to her cousins\
  \ somewhere in Brooklyn for the night, we cried with laughter in the middle of the\
  \ Great Smokies. Our saviour was group tours. I was definitely more eager about\
  \ group tours than her, the idea of sleeping in a tent and packing up and heading\
  \ to a new city every morning was my dream, not so much hers. We hiked Yosemite\
  \ separately. We experienced the things we should have seen together, separately.\
  \ By the end of the trip, we were living our American Dreams separately, not the\
  \ way we thought we would when we were 14.\n\nThis was the last thing I expected.\
  \ We will forever be bonded by this trip, all the experiences we went through together\
  \ \u2013 or as the tour group. But we don\u2019t speak any more. And that\u2019\
  s tough. I expected to come back with friends, not losing the one I went with."
