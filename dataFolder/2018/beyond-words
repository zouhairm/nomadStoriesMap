Text: "The wrinkled white hands were clutching the Ziploc bag tightly. She lovingly\
  \ handed over this bag to me uttering meekly-\u201CSvaneti Salt\u201D. The only\
  \ English that I had heard from her in 48 hours of my stay. \n\nGhostilla Villa\
  \ in the lap of the Caucacus mountain range in Svaneti, Georgia wasn\u2019t the\
  \ most inviting one. The sight of our rustic BnB aggravated the bitterness of the\
  \ spine chilling winter. The free movement of the two housedogs was terrifyingly\
  \ constricting me in the freezing cold house, sans heating.  \n\nThe old lady, dressed\
  \ in black from head to toe, gleaming in her wrinkle laden snowy skin was speculating\
  \ about the new guests in her villa. Gauging our hunger, her son led us towards\
  \ the lustrous petite frame, tucked in black. She graciously ushered us towards\
  \ her kitchen. \n\nThe tightly packed cooking platform was juxtaposed with neatly\
  \ stacked cutlery.  Although small, but the round kitchen table gave a chance where\
  \ we eight could huddle up together for human warmth. Apart from fellow humans,\
  \ the hissing oven in the center of the kitchen was working hard to emanate heat,\
  \ good for cooking and rising mercury. \n\n\u201CWe don\u2019t eat meat\u201D I\
  \ exclaimed. Instantly the man to her mother in Georgian translated it. The old\
  \ lady hurriedly scuttled out and returned with mud-covered tubers. Post the washing\
  \ and peeling ritual, the potato wedges sat on the iron skillet and the seasoned\
  \ crispy wedges found their way to our plates. The lady\u2019s timeworn eyes ordered\
  \ her son and we were offered a loaf of bread and handmade marmalade. \n\nStretching\
  \ on her frail toes, she pulled out a bamboo basket held on the hook from the ceiling,\
  \ ruffled the cloth on it and took out an oval piece of bread, speckled with blobs\
  \ of cheese and shyly moved it towards us. \u201CKachapuri - the famous Georgian\
  \ bread\u201D, the man said. It was the best bread we ever had on our bellowing\
  \ tummies.\n\nAs our bodies felt snug, our hunger satiated. Very intensely we could\
  \ feel the warmth of care in an alien land. We slept well on full stomach and motherly\
  \ care. \n\nThe aroma of the morning\u2019s fresh bake found its way to tickle my\
  \ senses. As I stepped in the kitchen, the oven fire was hissing. I saw the crinkly\
  \ hands lovingly caressing the dough into the fiery oven. A week had passed in a\
  \ flash; it was time to leave Svaneti. \n\nAs I turned, she clutched my hand, kept\
  \ the Ziploc bag with Svaneti Salt on one and Kachapuri on the other. I could see\
  \ teardrops trapped in the wrinkles of her face and one stuck at the corner of my\
  \ eye too."
