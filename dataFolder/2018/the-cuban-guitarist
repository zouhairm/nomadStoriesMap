Text: "It's a sweet, sticky late afternoon. The high-pitched, short-lived honk of\
  \ Nelson\u2019s old, Russian car pierces through the walls of the old Spanish mansion.\
  \ We come running out into a world saturated with luscious colors; the leaves a\
  \ little greener, the flowers a little brighter. Hand in hand, we're laughing and\
  \ looking at each other, unblinking- we didn\u2019t want to miss a moment. Barely\
  \ closing the heavy iron gate behind us, small beads of sweat gathering on my forehead.\
  \ We press our backs against the stone wall, taking shelter under the leaves and\
  \ making space on the broken sidewalk for the passersby. It was always the same.\
  \ First, they look at me with curiosity, knowing that I wasn\u2019t one of them.\
  \ Then they look at him, clearly Cuban with his beautiful chocolate skin and thick\
  \ curly brown hair. Then they look at us together. He laughs as he uses his free\
  \ hand to shake water off of the leaf above us and onto my head, both cooling and\
  \ teasing me. For a moment, the world slows. It's just me and him under the protection\
  \ of the tree. My fingers reaching up to press against his dimple as he smiles a\
  \ smile so bright that it fills me with more warmth than the hot Havana sun ever\
  \ could. \n\nAcross the street, Nelson smiles from behind the wheel as he pulls\
  \ a drag from his cigarette. Sandra leans her head out of the window with a smile.\
  \ \"Let's go!\" she says. English does not come easy for her. She only speaks it\
  \ for my benefit. \n \nWinding through the neighborhood, wind combing through my\
  \ curls and his hand on my thigh. Fast, fluid Spanish rolling off of their tongues.\
  \ He pauses to tell me that they\u2019re just complaining about the day\u2019s issues.\
  \ Today it\u2019s no water in the neighborhood. \u201CTomorrow\u201D he says, \u201C\
  It will be something else.\u201D And yet they go on with their lives and find joy\
  \ and happiness in every moment. I look at him as he returns to the conversation\
  \ and my breath catches in my throat. He is devastatingly handsome. We make a slow\
  \ turn onto the dusty road, I stare out of the window and catch a glimpse of the\
  \ growing line around a storefront, men and women waiting with ration cards in hand.\
  \  \n\nDuring the time of diplomatic leniency, when the door between the U.S. and\
  \ Cuba was briefly opened, I fell in love with the Cuban Guitarist. But more importantly,\
  \ it was then that I discovered a world where people found happiness and beauty\
  \ in the simplest of things, just by being alive. As bright as the colors of the\
  \ beautiful island, so shine the souls of its inhabitants."
