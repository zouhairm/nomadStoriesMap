Text: "Her eyes were a shade of a greenish-grey. They would reflect light at angles\
  \ so beautifully that they would look blue from a different eye. I lay there, skin\
  \ on grass. Above me, a noble firmament with gradients of shades of the royal yet\
  \ pleasant colour, blue.\nThe last thing that I ever expected would happen is this\
  \ \u2013 Sitting here, pinning mere words to dreams, building within the realms\
  \ of my mind and yours, something as intangibly invisible but, true, as a future.\
  \ Am I a twenty three year old girl in India, envisaging how life could unfold into\
  \ a beautiful reality where she has the power to bring good? Or am I here, reading\
  \ these words, hoping to find that inimitable soul, whose light shines brighter\
  \ through her words than the song of her words itself?\nWhilst I write these words,\
  \ I didn\u2019t expect the three themes to write about to surprisingly all fall\
  \ into the same story, my story. A tad bit out of the ordinary, it is miles from\
  \ norm in the shoes I was given. I never knew that a local connection along my travels\
  \ in South Africa would lead to a decision that pushed me to the edge \u2013 to\
  \ leave university, to eventually come to a day, two years later, where I am imprisoning\
  \ a fragment of that reality to a home, to share the weight of its beauty and learning.\n\
  I lay there, skin pressed against tough grass that would poke my crust with a seemingly\
  \ uncalled for hatred. Grass, which in that moment of ultimate nirvana, was soft\
  \ and much like a child's blankie. The breeze was gentle, the warmth just right.\
  \ That moment single-handedly defied Murphy\u2019s Law at its finest. Unceasing\
  \ stretches of the deep sky scattered between the branches of a lush, green, young\
  \ tree. I can still hear the birds chirp, vivid is the memory of the smell of fresh\
  \ sublimity. I had my eyes closed for a special moment, when I could still see everything\
  \ around me. In that moment I could feel flashes of all the many eyes that I have\
  \ shared a moment with. Tucked under my side, Sahara, the biggest of the three little\
  \ ones. Savoti, thrown ever so carefully in a careless fashion across my left shoulder,\
  \ and finally, Sarabi. She was the tiniest cub. She was curled into a ball in my\
  \ other arm, dreaming on my chest. She would inch closer and closer to my face every\
  \ time she woke up to yawn. They were lions.\nOne divine juncture in time present\
  \ as a whole, that's all it took. Glued within a milieu of content, gratitude and\
  \ just pure bliss, I was set off on a trajectory with a newfound faith in myself."
