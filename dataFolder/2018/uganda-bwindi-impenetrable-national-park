Text: "The plane ride passes quickly. One minute I\u2019m awake being asked by the\
  \ air hostess what I\u2019d like to eat and drink, the next I\u2019m being asked\
  \ to put up my tray table and the man behind me is digging his knees into my chair.\
  \ But I\u2019m finally doing it, the thing I promised my aunt I\u2019d do just before\
  \ she died: I\u2019m going to Uganda to see the gorillas. YOLO, and all that.\n\
  I look out the window, watching the local people scurry around as they wave their\
  \ flag in the air, signaling for the plane to stop. I turn and smile at the man\
  \ sitting beside me. He smiles back and wishes me a pleasant journey through his\
  \ country. His teeth are bright white against his skin. I thank him, the hostesses\
  \ wish me well as I make my way down the steps, and a warm southerly wind kissing\
  \ my cheek. I can smell the soil, fresh from summer rains.\nNext, it\u2019s immigration.\
  \ An official motions for me to come forward; they check my yellow fever immunisation\
  \ booklet then wave me through.\nThe air outside is hot and dry; my clothes stick\
  \ to me. No matter how many times I fan my face with the inflight magazine, sweat\
  \ drips down the side of my face forming a puddle between my breasts.\nI look at\
  \ the crowd in front of me, a sea of names propped up on home made signs. I find\
  \ my name attached to a short little man wearing a bright yellow t-shirt. He grins\
  \ at me and waves for me to follow him. I do as I\u2019m told. I get into his beaten\
  \ up yellow Honda and suspect my holiday is going to be nothing like the travel\
  \ brochures. The car bounces up and down, from side to side as the driver dodges\
  \ a handful of pot holes; an African massage. The road twists and turns; its full\
  \ of colour and madness. People sit on luggage on top of bus rooves, car horns toot.\
  \ The jacaranda trees are in full bloom. The dust from the sidewalk spirals up into\
  \ the air and covers the passersby. Moments later i\u2019m dropped off at the hotel\
  \ nauseous, but grateful to have my limbs intact. The receptionist checks me in\
  \ and gives me my key. I thank her and retire to my room for the night. The next\
  \ morning I make my way down to the lobby and meet the other tour members. The tour\
  \ guide welcomes us all then jumps into the nitty gritty. \u201CIt\u2019s a long\
  \ 7 hour drive on eroded, bending roads to get to our destination,\u201D he says.\
  \ I look around at the group of fellow travellers, in the hopes that they too look\
  \ horrified at the prospect of having to throw up in their Prada handbag. But the\
  \ majority of them just smile and nod. I'm 115kgs. I'm going to die."
