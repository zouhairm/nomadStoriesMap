Text: "\"Why are you following me?\" Connor said, to which I jokingly replied: \"\
  \ I was here first.\" \nHe asked if I was signing up for the overnight safari and\
  \ I thought to myself \"I wouldn't be doing much tonight and let's be spontaneous\
  \ for a change\" so I said yes.\nAround three in the afternoon, the driver called\
  \ for us and we drove for about an hour and a half to the location where the guide\
  \ was going to pick us up. He was waiting with three camels and right at that moment\
  \ I thought \"this was going to become another clich\xE9d experience.\"\nI had almost\
  \ forgotten how uncomfortable it was but quickly remembered as I was trying my hardest\
  \ not to fall off the seat. If you ever wanted to know how the view would look like\
  \ sitting on the shoulders of an average NBA player try getting on the back of a\
  \ camel.\nIt wasn't too long before we reached the sand dunes, the guide had unpacked\
  \ the stuff he had bought to cook dinner with, he said: \"I'll go find some wood\
  \ to light a fire, you guys enjoy the sunset.\" \nConnor and I opened our beers,\
  \ out of nowhere a wasp started chasing Connor, he ran as fast as he could shouting\
  \ \"Desert wasp!\" tumbling down the dunes, dropping his beer and getting sand all\
  \ over him.\nThe wasp had finally left us as we watched the sun go down leaving\
  \ a pink hue in the sky and eventually the moon was the only light source left behind.\n\
  The guide had come back with the amount of wood that wouldn't last for the night\
  \ and out of nowhere, this other guy appears like a wasp trying to sell us cold\
  \ beers, two bottles each we bid him goodbye but he came back after some time to\
  \ help build a campfire.\nWhile the guide was busy cooking dinner the mysterious\
  \ beer seller started talking, he introduced himself as the mentor of our guide\
  \ and how he had retired from this business and now sells beer to thirsty tourists\
  \ on the desert.\nBy this time the guide had finished cooking and was ready to serve\
  \ us, we gathered around the fire with our plates full of rice, roti's (Indian bread)\
  \ and potato curry. \nThe food surprisingly tasted good. Connor asked the guide\
  \ and the beer seller what was their favourite food and they both replied: \"we\
  \ don't have any favourites, this is the best food that we can find right here on\
  \ this plate.\" \nWe slowly made our way to bed and woke up at first light in the\
  \ morning. After breakfast the guide rushed us back to the location where he picked\
  \ us up he asked if we could give him a good review and maybe go check him at the\
  \ camel race two days later."
