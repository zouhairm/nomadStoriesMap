Text: "'The fastest lane in India is the Snake Lane,' explains Shashi as we weave\
  \ between two trucks, horn blazing and headlights flashing. \n\nIt\u2019s my first\
  \ time on a Rajasthani highway in a small car and I'm feeling vulnerable. Brown,\
  \ flowing desert engulfs stone forts, dry shrubs and roadside rubbish fires. Normally\
  \ I\u2019m tucked into a sleeper bus, gratefully unaware of the chaos around me,\
  \ but tonight I'm on a high speed trip to Jaipur, buzzing on sweet chai and gripping\
  \ my seat with every serpentine lane change.\n\n'Why are you wearing a seatbelt,\
  \ man? Do you have bad karma?'\n\nWe met at Savatri Temple, both climbing the long\
  \ staircase to watch darkened mountains glow after the lunar eclipse. The following\
  \ day we toured Pushkar's crumbling back roads, stopping at sunset to feed flocks\
  \ of peacocks and meet Aloo Baba, the local sadhu who's lived for 21 years on potatoes.\
  \ On a whim, we decided to visit Shashi's brother.\n\n'Can you drive?'\n\nI grip\
  \ the wheel as he shares the mythology behind local temples and palaces; epics of\
  \ princesses, sorcerers and war. In the fading light, oncoming vehicles swerve extra\
  \ close when they see I'm a foreigner, testing my nerve as our wheels edge closer\
  \ to unforgiving boulders. We swap back in Ajmer after too many close calls.\n\n\
  As relentless high beams dazzle us, we discuss India's future. He's optimistic about\
  \ her 1.3 billion humans and believes he can make positive changes. It's a  refreshing\
  \ break from my scepticism yet we clash on ecology, the air condensing with a sudden\
  \ clench. Wildlife management, omnivory, hunting; jagged concepts within a vegetarian\
  \ culture sustained over millennia. We dwell in the first conversational silence,\
  \ music soothing the sharp edges. \n\n'Do you believe in God?'\n\nHe's pushing the\
  \ big questions to keep us awake. I explain my position as best I can after nearly\
  \ five hours in the car--a shared consciousness, nature's intelligence, culture\
  \ as a lens. It's remarkably close to his, just dressed in different language. \
  \ \n\nOur reflexes are fading and a wrong turn takes us off the highway into a police\
  \ roadblock. After a few minutes of arguing I hear the words \"Education Minister\"\
  . The officer reluctantly lets us through.\n\n'He wanted 500 rupees. You can't drive\
  \ at night without political connections. I really need some tea!'\n\nRolling desert\
  \ merges with harsh cement as I play the final tracks from a dying laptop. Together\
  \ we shed the stress of the Snake Lane, fresh insights weaving through exhausted\
  \ minds."
