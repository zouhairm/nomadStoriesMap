Text: "The sensation of a near rain filled the atmosphere of my first day at Andaluc\xED\
  a. We arrived in Granada, and went straight to the main attraction \u201CLa Alhambra\u201D\
  . Every single glimpse from the inside was a delightful spectacle. After that, we\
  \ went downhill to the Albaicin district to San Nicolas\u2019s lookout. From there\
  \ you can see la Alhambra in its entire splendor. She told me she would love to\
  \ relax in there. Some guys were playing flamenco.  When they took a break I asked\
  \ the guitarist if he could let me play. I played a song for her and we enjoyed\
  \ the rest of the afternoon until the dusk came. We returned to rest at Jimena\u2019\
  s home. There I met her lovely family. Then, after some small talk and a lot of\
  \ laughs I felt like I was back home. \nThe second day was brighter, and being October\
  \ 12th the preparations for the celebration of \u201CD\xEDa de la hispanidad\u201D\
  \ were being made. Being a poetry lover I was happy with the fact was the city that\
  \ witnessed Federico Garc\xEDa Lorca\u2019s birth. Nevertheless it\u2019s gloomy\
  \ to find that during the Spanish civil war he was murdered in this land... his\
  \ land.  As his friend, poet as well, Antonio Machado claimed in his poem \u201C\
  The crime was in Granada\u201D:\nBlood in the forehead and lead on the bowels/\n\
  Carve, friends, of stone and dreams a mound to the poet.\nOver a fountain where\
  \ the water will weep and eternally will say:\nThe crime was in Granada, in his\
  \ Granada\nLorca was killed not for having any kind of particular politics beliefs,\
  \ but for being gay. \nWe went for a beer at a bar with Jimena\u2019s friends. Some\
  \ of they were excited with the celebration. It recalled me a bittersweet feeling:\
  \ the concept of a \"fiesta nacional\" based on the discovery of Colon, that brought\
  \ so much suffering to my country make me feel a bit bad. But, then as I saw Jimena\
  \ I felt some kind family bond between us. I quickly forgot about that bittersweet\
  \ feeling. The history of our countries might have not been a love story, but at\
  \ the end, that is what it is: history, and that could not change the fact that\
  \ her went from being total strangers to one of my greatest friends. So, I put my\
  \ \u201Cca\xF1a\u201D up and cheered with a smile on my face \u201C!Salud!\u201D"
