Text: "Just a short boat ride from Venice lies the island of Burano. Famous for its\
  \ lace-making and bright-colored buildings, it was the perfect place to get away\
  \ from the tourist-filled Venice streets, even if just for a day. It was a beautiful\
  \ summer day with the sun clearly shining off the small waves of the lagoon. We\
  \ boarded the vaporetto and took our seats on the edge. Excited to meet new people,\
  \ try amazing foods and decompress after a summer of college coursework, we couldn\u2019\
  t stop talking.\n\nWhen we got to the town, vendors eager to sell their wares dotted\
  \ the streets. The bright orange, red, green and blue buildings all around the small\
  \ island played with the eyes, like a psychedelic ride at a carnival. I had never\
  \ seen anything like this before. We wandered the streets, stopping in shops, taking\
  \ in the sights, and relaxing in the calm all around us.\n\nAs we ventured toward\
  \ one end of the island, we came upon some older men sitting outside a house playing\
  \ cards. My friend spoke some Italian and struck up a conversation with them. They\
  \ were eager to include us in their card game and share their wine with us. Their\
  \ wives even brought us sweets to tide us over. We spent hours laughing and sharing\
  \ stories, trying our best to communicate with our limited language skills.\n\n\
  As the day began to wind down, we realized that we hadn\u2019t eaten much. Our new\
  \ friends gave us plenty of options in town, perfect for locals and tourists alike.\
  \ It was time to wander on. We snapped some pictures and headed back toward the\
  \ small crowds of people.  We waved good-bye, a little sad to leave, but it was\
  \ time.\n\nAfter dinner, we headed back to Venice. A bit more tired but so much\
  \ more relaxed, the peaceful sway of the vaporetto lulling us into a light sleep.\
  \ Before we knew it, the shadows of the gondolas appearing on the waterway in front\
  \ of us. We glided onto dry land and moved toward the sounds of the bustling crowds,\
  \ with memories of island hospitality and feelings of true warmth forever in our\
  \ hearts."
