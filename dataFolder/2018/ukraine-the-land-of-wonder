Text: "I am 19 and it is my first trip abroad without a tour bus, college friends\
  \ or parents. We\u2019re hitch-hiking to Ukraine, to open air ethnic music and land\
  \ art festival Sheshory that takes place in the Carpathian village of the same name.\n\
  We\u2019re broke, having just finished our first year in university, but we have\
  \ Ukrainian friends to help with accommodation! After a wonderful tour of Lviv,\
  \ a visit to open air Museum of National Folk Architecture and Rural Life, and a\
  \ short game of frisbee with friends in the old town \u2013 we\u2019re hosted at\
  \ a friend\u2019s house and offered a plate of wonderful borscht soup for supper.\n\
  Next morning, we set off to Sheshory with a bus full of musicians playing their\
  \ medieval lutes and flutes. It was a magical prelude to the surreal things to come.\
  \ Thor was beating his drum when we arrived and the valley by the river, where the\
  \ stage was set, was already full of people. The rain came next and our tent got\
  \ soaking wet. After some inquiries, a local teacher welcomed us into her living\
  \ room for just a few dollars! \nUpon waking up, we found that local grannies and\
  \ grandpas had come down to the valley with their magnificent merchandise: traditional\
  \ shirts embroidered with maroon-colored thread, ethnic broom-talismans, freshly\
  \ baked bread and various cheeses. \nWe explored the village, bought some wine,\
  \ local cheese and bread and sat on the grass. The wine was doing its job, but the\
  \ greatest joy came from observing all the beautiful people laughing and dancing,\
  \ the fog rising over the mountains, black Hutsul hats adorned with peacock feathers\
  \ and their music that was going faster and faster until our feet stopped touching\
  \ the ground. And when you thought that this is it, things could not get more magical,\
  \ a guy would appear just behind you playing a reed pipe as if in conversation with\
  \ the band on stage.\nDid I anticipate that the magic will continue the next day?\
  \ Probably, but the visit to a local woman\u2019s house, whose mother was well-known\
  \ for weaving the famous Ukrainian poet Taras Shevchenko\u2019s poems as symbols\
  \ into her linen towels was far beyond my expectations. Just like a medieval music\
  \ concert spontaneously performed as a thank you by a band of musicians from St.\
  \ Petersburg in her living room.\nA lonesome man near the river at night serenading\
  \ the full moon with his sitar was the perfect epitome. In all truth \u2013 I did\
  \ not expect that this journey will award me with so much beauty. Ukraine opened\
  \ itself to us fully and showed its most gorgeous colors."
