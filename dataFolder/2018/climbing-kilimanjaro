Text: "I decided to do it because so new friends from university had signed up and\
  \ I thought it sounded cool. One by one the pressure of fundraising got to them\
  \ and they had dropped out, and all of a sudden I found myself at Machame Gate signing\
  \ in to Kilimanjaro National Park with expectations of what the next six days would\
  \ hold almost entirely set by the celebrities that climbed Killimanjaro for Comic\
  \ Relief years ago. \n\nThere was a huge group of us, the biggest sent by Childreach\
  \ International that year, and getting everyone ready to go was a bit like herding\
  \ cats. For this reason we were about two hours later than we should have been and\
  \ it was decided we should eat lunch before we started walking. Squashed onto picnic\
  \ tables, everyone was talking, trying to distract ourselves from thinking about\
  \ what it was we were just about to do. There was a monkey, I can't remember the\
  \ species now, hanging around the picnic area. We were enthralled by him until he\
  \ launched himself onto the table and began eating as much of our lunch as he could\
  \ before he was shooed away.\n\nThen it was time to start walking, and at first\
  \ it didn't seem to bad. There was a wide path working its way up through the jungle,\
  \ it was humid, but not unbearably so, and everyone was making an effort with conversation.\n\
  \nFlash forward to summit night and the atmosphere of the group has dampened. No\
  \ one spoke. It was all anyone could do to keep walking, and try not to look up\
  \ at the headlamps high, high above. Higher than it seemed possible to be. \n\n\
  I no longer have the concept of time. We could have been walking for five hours,\
  \ but then it could have only been fifteen minutes. For the last couple of days\
  \ eating has been a struggle, but my body needs energy. I eventually manage to swallow\
  \ a jelly baby and immediately sick it back up again. I try to have a sip of water.\
  \ It's frozen. Fabulous. \n\nI keep on walking, pole pole, slowly slowly, as the\
  \ porters keep reminding us.  I kept asking one of them \"I am going to do this,\
  \ aren't I?\" and he kept reassuring me I would. It felt like a false hope. And\
  \ then the sun rose, and every cliche about how incredible it is were true. Being\
  \ able to see more than a couple of feet in front of me felt like a new lease of\
  \ life and all of a sudden it didn't seem so hard any more. I was thirsty. I still\
  \ felt sick. But I was close. I could do it, and in what felt like no time at all,\
  \ I had. Now, finally, I was finished.\n\nI'd forgotten we had to walk back down\
  \ again."
