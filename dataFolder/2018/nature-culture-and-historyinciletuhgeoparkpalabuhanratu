Text: "Indonesia has a lot of diversities in nature, culture, history and people.\
  \ It has 33 provinces with their rich unique diversities which can be the promotion\
  \ media for Indonesia tourism to the world. In recent years, Indonesia is focusing\
  \ to improve the tourism by bringing up a lot of wonderful destinations in various\
  \ area and promoting them to all over the world.\n\nAt that night, I was invited\
  \ by Tourism Department of West Java to come along in a series of events at Ciletuh\
  \ Geopark Palabuhanratu.  I took part in an event called Amazing Geopark Adventure\
  \ Tourism 2017 (AGAT 2017) which was held at throughout regions of Ciletuh Geopark\
  \ cooperating with bloggers, vloggers and surfers coming from several countries.\n\
  \nGeopark Ciletuh Palabuhanratu\n\nExploring these regions along 3 days hasn\u2019\
  t made me feel satisfied since there are still many locations in this area which\
  \ has other uniqueness. Along 3 days, the group explored some places such as Cimaja\
  \ Beach, Sinar Resmi Village, Samoedra Beach Hotel with its famous room of Nyi Roro\
  \ Kidul (mystical story), and Cisolok Geyser. Each place has its uniqueness such\
  \ as Cimaja Beach for surfing paradise, Sinar Resmi Village for cultural relics\
  \ of Kasepuhan Custom, as well as geological uniqueness in Cisolok Geyser which\
  \ always sprays water for hundred years.\n\nCIMAJA BEACH\n\nCimaja Beach is the\
  \ best surfing paradise in Ciletuh Geopark since its waves are loved by either local\
  \ or foreign surfers. Therefore, Cimaja Beach was picked as the venue of AGAT 2017\
  \ event in which the opening show presented the surf challenge for local and foreign\
  \ surfers. Some famous national-caliber surfers such as Dede Mulyana and Gemala\
  \ took part in this surf challenge.\n\nPublic Officials such as Regent, Governor,\
  \ even the Minister of Tourism also attended the opening of AGAT 2017. This is because\
  \ this event is an international event that will be held every year. It is held\
  \ to promote Ciletuh Geopark to larger society either to local, national or even\
  \ overseas. In addition, it is trying to succeed the mission of government to make\
  \ this region as UNESCO Global Geopark area. \n\nGEOPARK CILETUH PALABUHANRATU\n\
  \nThe Ciletuh Geopark area is truly potential as the world tourism destination because\
  \ it has a lot of interesting natural, historical and cultural wealth. Moreover,\
  \ if this area becomes the UNESCO Global Geopark, it will be globally known as other\
  \ famous tourism parks on the world.\nLet's explore Ciletuh Geopark and tell to\
  \ the world!"
