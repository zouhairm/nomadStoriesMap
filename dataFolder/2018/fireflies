Text: "Early on wanderlust and wonder were fires that kept my heart warm and my dreams\
  \ idyllic. These traits were instilled by parents who had once traveled themselves;\
  \ my dad to Asia and my mom to Europe and Australia. They told stories of their\
  \ inspiring ventures as we grew up, impressing us with pictures of worldliness and\
  \ class. Memorable among these was my dad holding a monkey; the very image of culture\
  \ to any kid.\nI was timid then, but family was my escape. We took trips across\
  \ Canada and the U.S. in a trailer beat by sun, wind, and boisterous kids, camped\
  \ under black skies in thick forests full of the untroubled meandering of lucent\
  \ fireflies, and hiked above green mountains into rocky caps where blustery weather\
  \ curled around three tousled young heads.\nTimidity turned to social anxiety as\
  \ a teen. Despite this I joined a school trip to Europe along with other hormonal\
  \ adolescents from America and Canada. I was interested in the exchanges there,\
  \ but more taken with the cultural hubs. The Louvre as the artisan\u2019s still-beating\
  \ heart, the Eiffel Tower\u2019s beacon of light, Swarovski crystal museum\u2019\
  s absurd genius, the wonderfully quirky architecture of Hundertwasser in Vienna.\n\
  It\u2019d been years since I\u2019d made a good friend, so I was overjoyed upon\
  \ forming a kinship with the American boys. However, the girl-boy dynamic caused\
  \ teasing by students and teachers alike, and so incessantly it broke through my\
  \ thin skin. In the end, in the bathroom of an overnight train, I locked myself\
  \ away and succumbed to a severe panic attack. Outside people knocked, murmuring\
  \ questions I couldn\u2019t answer.\nYet even enshrouded by bitterness at this scarring\
  \ of my trip, clutching the sink with white knuckles watching tears irritate my\
  \ skin; I knew it\u2019d been accidental. How could they have known how easy to\
  \ unbalance me it was? Yet I felt empty, and my heart was cold. Where would I find\
  \ the light to warm it again? I closed my eyes and tried to remember; warm nights,\
  \ a trailer and fireflies. The heat began to return. The train moved on.\nYears\
  \ later and back in Europe, I\u2019ve realized since that not all edges we\u2019\
  re brought to are good ones, but even in our hurt we can choose well. In that particular\
  \ moment I had to decide how I\u2019d handle my condition. Would I let it run my\
  \ life? No. I had a world to see that even at my coldest pulled me to the unexplored\
  \ like it always had. If I keep choosing to remember that, I can move forward even\
  \ through the dark. But you know? The fireflies are never far."
