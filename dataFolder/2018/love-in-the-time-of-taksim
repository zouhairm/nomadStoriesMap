Text: "They say love happens when you least expect it.  Actually, I expected it, only\
  \ with someone else. Al Gore, was holding a training session in Istanbul, Turkey\
  \ and I was going to make him fall in love with me.\nWeeks later, I landed in Ataturk\
  \ International Airport. At the end of the jetway I saw who I thought was George\
  \ Clooney.  Suddenly I hear my name called out in a husky Turkish accent. Clooney\
  \ was actually my Turkish host, Ercan.  He inquired if I wanted to check out Taksim\
  \ Square.  On we went, clambering down steps and onto the darkened streets of Istanbul,\
  \ excited with the prospect of a good protest.  Our taxi swerved through the suburbs\
  \ of Istanbul and turned onto the coastal road where I got my first glimpse of the\
  \ Sea of Marmara.\n\nAs Taksim Square came into sight, Ercan grabbed my hand. We\
  \ proceeded to whatever awaited us. From a distance I heard something unbelievable\
  \ - a wave of classical music.  We walked toward a crowd of a thousand people or\
  \ more. It looked like a war zone but felt ethereal.  Everyone I could see was forming\
  \ a giant hive around the source of the music. In the center of the hive there was\
  \ a man playing a grand piano.  A light drizzle cooled the formerly angry masses.\
  \  We hovered with the rest of the thousands and just listened.\n\nTomorrow was\
  \ Day 1 of Climate Reality Leadership Corps and Al Gore.  I needed my beauty sleep.\
  \ I tried to see Al but the convention center was smack dab in the middle of the\
  \ riots, surrounded by protesters, tear gas and riot police.\n\nOur training ended,\
  \ in a puff of tear gas and no Al Gore. When the gas cleared, there was Ercan, waiting\
  \ for me. I ran into his arms. He lead me between the fighting factions back to\
  \ the safety of his Bakirk\xF6y neighborhood. We stopped at a fruit vendor's stand\
  \ in anticipation for dinner. The stand was arrayed better than jewels at Tiffany's.\
  \ Fresh ruby-red or pinkish-yellow dappled cherries, mint green mini pears, fuzzy\
  \ saffron-colored apricots, all arranged delicately on beds of leaves, giant lettuces\
  \ and fresh herbs, as if still growing in the garden, sprouting from wooden crates.\
  \ It was a feast for the eyes, yet it filled me with sadness knowing that soon this\
  \ Garden of Eden would go the way of the Dodo because of climate change. Why would\
  \ we put such bounty at risk? Eventually the moment we dreaded had arrived. Ercan\
  \ and I shook hands at the airport. I managed to mutter \"Thank you for love in\
  \ the time of Taksim.\""
