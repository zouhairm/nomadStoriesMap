Text: "\u20183.5 hours behind\u2019, she thought as she prepared herself to get used\
  \ to the time zone. \u2018It isn\u2019t so bad.\u2019\nInside, Sara smiled knowing\
  \ what lay ahead.\nAfter a 19-hour ordeal, she finally arrived at the place she\
  \ would call home for the next two months. \u2018Home\u2019, she thought, dropping\
  \ her bags, as it looked nothing like what she was used to. It had been 3 years\
  \ since she lived at home. Hotels, hostels, dormitories.. it had become a way of\
  \ life. \n\u201CLet\u2019s go! We need to get your currency exchanged and buy you\
  \ a sim card.\u201D The boys yelled shortly after she arrived. It was close to 8\
  \ PM. She thought she understood why they were in a hurry.\nThe little city seemed\
  \ strange. It was dull, yet bustling with life. \u201CHalf past 8 and there are\
  \ still so many people outside?\u201D This was definitely something she was not\
  \ used to. She grew up with a 9 PM curfew. This change felt liberating yet restricting.\
  \ It wasn\u2019t every day that she saw armed soldiers on the streets. She didn\u2019\
  t know if she had to feel safe or afraid. It\u2019s not easy to be yourself in a\
  \ new patriarchal society. \nBy the time she got home that night, she was so overwhelmed.\
  \ So many questions filled her mind. 'Was she also expected to cover her head? Was\
  \ it wrong to show skin? Was it safe to walk on the streets alone?' With all these\
  \ thoughts, she fell asleep.\nShe woke up early the next day; jet-lag.\nShe got\
  \ dressed and decided to explore the city. It was 10 AM. The city looked different\
  \ in daylight. All the boards were in Arabic. Most buildings looked incomplete.\
  \ The shops were closed and the streets barely had any people. It was lonely. As\
  \ she walked, some boys yelled out to her in Arabic. She felt indifferent.\n\nSpotting\
  \ a small restaurant she went in for some food. \"What's your name?\" The man asked,\
  \ seeing that she wasn't from around there. \n\"Assumpta\" she replied. \"Okay!\
  \ From today your Egyptian name is Sara.\" He said with a smile. She smiled.\n\n\
  It had been two weeks.\nShe made a few friends, found a regular diner and a local\
  \ parish community. She had finally found her place in this new city. She fit in\
  \ so well that the new friends she\u2019d make assumed she was a local. \n\u201C\
  You look Egyptian!\u201D they exclaimed. \u201CLike someone from south Egypt. What\
  \ is your name?\u201D\n\u201CSara.\u201D She said with the biggest smile on her\
  \ face.\n\u201CAn Egyptian name! You are Egyptian, aren\u2019t you?\u201D\nDeep\
  \ down, Assumpta smiled. \u20183.5 hours isn\u2019t so bad\u2019, she thought.\n\
  She realised one thing that night, time is never a difference when your heart is\
  \ at home."
