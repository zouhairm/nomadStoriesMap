Text: "It was a lovely day of fall in Quebec, the temperature was extraordinarily\
  \ high for the season. 26\xB0 Celsius in October. I woke up and looked around me.\
  \ The colors were overwhelming, shades of yellow, red and orange dyed the nature\
  \ surrounding me like a painting.\n\n\L\LTwo days after the beginning of my trip,\
  \ I was still on the choc. I couldn\u2019t realize what was happening to me. Five\
  \ days ago I was still in my cubicle in Brussels, working on my 9 to 5 job, bored\
  \ to death. Those fives days passed in a rush, and without noticing it. I was out\
  \ exploring the world. \nI still remember bargaining for a promotion, threaten them\
  \ to quit if I don\u2019t have what I wanted. I did it! Now what ?\n\n\L\LI got\
  \ up that day with this feeling of freedom you have when you start something new.\
  \ Let\u2019s start by exploring this city. I went to the Montmorency falls, located\
  \ 7km north of Quebec. I heard they were beautiful.\n\n\L\LI took my bag, a camera\
  \ and let\u2019s go! Arrived over there, it was magnificent. The biggest falls I\
  \ have ever seen in my life! I took my time, enjoy the view and contemplated them\
  \ : 84m high and 46m wide : 30 m higher than the Niagara. They were the highest\
  \ fall in the province of Quebec. \L\LBut that wasn\u2019t enough for me. I was\
  \ thirsty for adventure. Arrived at the bottom of the waterfall, I went right next\
  \ to it. This feeling! Being next to the gigantic stream, feeling the strength and\
  \ the noise of the water surrounding me, soaked wet after 20 seconds and surrounded\
  \ by a 360\xB0 rainbow. I was free!\n\n\L\LBoosted by this experience, I told myself.\
  \ \xAB\_Let\u2019s go back by another way\_\xBB. I\u2019ve heard there was an hidden\
  \ falls next to it \xAB La chute de La dame blanche\_\xBB. It was lovely, drizzling\
  \ onto the rocks, the contrast was perfect and I immediately felt the need to climb\
  \ it.\n\nThe first meters went smoothly, I haven\u2019t done free climbing in ages,\
  \ but it felt great. I stopped in the middle of the waterfall and realized I was\
  \ stuck. I was only at 30 meters, but the rock was so crumbly and cutting. Every\
  \ time I tried to move, I hurt myself. I suddenly realize how high I was and felt\
  \ a little bit dizzy.\L\L\n\nThe human being is truly awesome, and that\u2019s in\
  \ the worst situation that you reveal you capacities. I find the strength to go\
  \ sideway and grab a tree branch. I still couldn\u2019t go back, so I climb the\
  \ rest of the waterfall, on its side, helping me with the trees. Boosted with the\
  \ adrenaline rush, it only took me a couple of minutes to arrive at the top. \n\n\
  \L\LI just climbed an 70m waterfall."
