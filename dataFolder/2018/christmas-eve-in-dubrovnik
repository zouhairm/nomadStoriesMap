Text: "Perched above a grey and curdled Adriatic Sea, the Christmas market is being\
  \ clobbered by vicious gusts of wind. My eyes and nostrils begin to stream.\n\n\
  I discover a small table on the perimeter with an array of sterling silver pendants,\
  \ beautifully hand-crafted with charming asymmetry. Picking one up shaped like an\
  \ elongated acorn, it immediately assumes a pleasing solidity and presence in my\
  \ hand. \n\nA man with greying hair scraped back in a pony tail, explains how he\
  \ makes all the pendants himself. I hold the pendant up for a closer inspection\
  \ in the light and silently wonder whether now would be a good time to ask my question.\
  \ \n\nHe takes a step closer. \u201CThe acorn is a very special traditional symbol\
  \ in Croatia. It represents prosperity and brings the wearer good luck.\u201D \n\
  \nHe passes over his business card. I take note of his name. He rolls a cigarette.\
  \ I make up my mind. \n\n\u201CJosip... What was it like here during the war?\u201D\
  \ \n\nHis face tightens and I\u2019m not surprised. I\u2019ve already asked this\
  \ question many times on my travels through the former Yugoslavia, from Zagreb to\
  \ Split. And the further east I travel, and the closer to the borders of Serbia,\
  \ the more fraught the topic of the Homeland War becomes.\n\nWith his back to me,\
  \ he lights the cigarette, thin fingers curved against the wind. \n\nI wait for\
  \ a response.\n\nHe turns around. \u201CWhere are you from?\u201D\n\n\u201CAustralia.\u201D\
  \n\nJosip nods as if this somehow explains my foolishness. Between short sucks of\
  \ his cigarette, he relates how he lost friends and his family home. How his brother\u2019\
  s wife and young daughters were raped and killed while his brother looked on in\
  \ helpless fury and grief, unable to move to save them as both legs had been broken\
  \ with a shovel.\n\nHis eyes grow wet and, this time, the fault lies not with the\
  \ wind. He throws the spent butt into a battered tin. \u201CHow could he live, how\
  \ could anyone live, after seeing that... You know, every single day, a tourist\
  \ asks us about the war. And for us, it\u2019s like reliving it all over again.\u201D\
  \n\nI feel ashamed, especially when I recall that over 10,000 tourists had surged\
  \ through Dubrovnik each and every day the previous summer.\n\nI apologise. His\
  \ expression softens, and I get the impression he gets my overriding desire to know\
  \ more about the war, even if that means having to ask questions that cause others\
  \ pain. \n\nI pull out my wallet.\n\nJosip waves my money away. \u201CTake it. I\
  \ think you will need it.\u201D\n\nI walk away with the acorn clenched tight in\
  \ my hand."
