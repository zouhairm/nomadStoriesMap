Text: "The woman behind me hands me a blue plastic bag. The speedboat is packed to\
  \ capacity, or perhaps beyond. There are no lifejackets in sight. Each time the\
  \ boat climbs a wave and then violently rushes down, the children scream. Thud.\
  \ My bottom hurts. I have never realized that water can be that hard. Thud. How\
  \ am I going to survive four hours of this? A particularly violent wave hits the\
  \ hull and for a second we are launched vertically into the air. The tightly packed\
  \ space fills with the stench of vomit.\n\nA typical tourist to the Maldives visits\
  \ a postcard-perfect resort. Why then am I going to a local island so far away?\
  \ During a storm advisory, no less? I am sure I had a good reason at the time. I\
  \ don\u2019t remember it anymore. I am too preoccupied with holding on to the metal\
  \ bar in front of me as if my life depends on it. Because it probably does.\n\n\
  When one of the engines fails and the skipper starts looking visibly stressed, I\
  \ finally begin to question my judgement. The Maldivian woman behind me alternates\
  \ between throwing up and reciting verses from the Quran. Filled up bags are simply\
  \ tossed into the ocean. This is probably the first time in my life when I am grateful\
  \ for my inner ear injury. It has rendered me immune to motion sickness.\n\nWith\
  \ the speedboat tossed further and further into the open ocean, the prayers in Dhivehi,\
  \ the local language, and Arabic, sound more and more fervent by the minute. For\
  \ most people, a visit to the Maldives is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. The irony\
  \ of this statement is not lost on me. From the looks of it, my lifetime might end\
  \ at any second. And this IS my first visit to the Maldives. Yet, unlike most people\
  \ who come here to enjoy the luxuries of five star resorts, with overwater villas\
  \ and butler services, I am about to die en route to a local island nobody has ever\
  \ heard of. \n\n\u201CI want to see the real Maldives,\u201D I said. I must admit,\
  \ it\u2019s hard to find a more Maldivian experience than drifting in a boat with\
  \ forty people during a storm. The woman next to me explains in English, \u201C\
  the sea is like an unbeliever\u2019s heart.\u201D She shoots me an accusatory look.\
  \ \u201CIt says so in the Holy Quran.\u201D She hands me her smartphone open to\
  \ the Google Translate page. I read the text in English, grateful to have something\
  \ to occupy my mind.\n\nAs soon as I finish, the failed engine starts up again.\
  \ We are not going to die after all! \n\u201CSee?\u201D she says smugly while retrieving\
  \ her phone. \u201CYour prayer worked. You have a true Maldivian soul now.\""
