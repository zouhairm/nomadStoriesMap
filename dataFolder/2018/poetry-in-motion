Text: "She had her share in one of the most nefarious chemical bombings that turned\
  \ the Idlib province into a kill zone. Deceased bodies lay muddled up on the ramshackle\
  \ streets, as the heaviness of chlorine filled Raqqa\u2019s air. Scores of people,\
  \ mostly children, and women, died; writhing and choking at the mouth of its toxicity.\
  \ \u201CIt was like a winter fog\u201D\u2013 she sighed.\n\nVociferous thuds of\
  \ cries and screeches battered her soul.\n\nThe epiphany of fate intertwined two\
  \ far-off souls, one from a war raged country and other from the third world; both\
  \ struggling to keep their feet together.\n\nParis School of International Affairs\
  \ welcomed our participation in their annual Youth Summit on The Migration Crisis.\
  \ Our merits and backgrounds, both contributed.\n\nThe summit sessions lasted till\
  \ noon, Paris having us for the rest of the hours.\n \nSavoring Oberkampf\u2019\
  s gourmet pastiche of cheesy whipped potatoes, Nutella souffl\xE9 and wild strawberry\
  \ sherbet; we felt the summer wind on our face, as we rollerbladed our Lapierre\
  \ bikes through Bastille\u2019s linden-tree-lined streets. Parisian gypsy jazz poured\
  \ out of cafes\u2019 open doors along with the aroma of freshly baked lasagna. \n\
  \nWe hopped on to the Bir-Hakeim\u2019s metro and soon, found ourselves quivering\
  \ with a frisson of fear and pleasure atop the Eiffel Tower. Her iron shades of\
  \ chestnut fell beneath us. Neighboring her, the river Seine laid vibrant and universe-blue\
  \ color, like the subtle sweep of a painter\u2019s brush.\nAs the sunset horizon\
  \ developed, her serene shorelines sparkled in shades of amber. During her cocktail\
  \ hour from five to seven, she chose to be the spectator of our rendezvous.\n\n\
  We sat by the cobblestoned bank and gazed at her blue and white smiles. Our feet\
  \ laid in inclination with the moist soil.If only we could tear out our hearts and\
  \ hurl into the current, then our pain and miseries would be over, and we could\
  \ finally forget.\n\nPorcelain cheeks, glistening pools of pearl, glittered under\
  \ sunshine\u2019s powdered gold.  Her languid eyelashes of velvet black floated\
  \ in the summer breeze. The corner of her eyes crinkled and her lips slid upwards,\
  \ poised between a laughter and silence. The Parisian jewelry reduced to the surface\
  \ of her skin and her inner self was free from all bitterness.\n\nSlowly, in a bittersweet\
  \ discovery, she found her soul\u2019s refuge; which, even the grey herons in her\
  \ backyard stream couldn\u2019t give.\n\nSoon, we would be back.\n \nThese moments\
  \ shall remain, trapped inside an ethereal parenthesis in cosmic infinity."
