Text: "When the Big Apple Falls on your Head\u2026\n\u2026say, as locals do, \u201C\
  Welcome to Argentina,\u201D the standard stoic response to countless daily disappointments.\
  \  It\u2019s a phrase heard frequently in Buenos Aires, accompanied by a knowing\
  \ smile and a half-hearted shrug. Argentinians are, above all, resilient. They expect\
  \ the unexpected.\n\u201CWelcome to Argentina,\u201D the noisy, angry crowd told\
  \ us as we approached a casa de cambio upon arrival at the airport. The iron bars\
  \ of the teller window bangled loudly, slamming shut in our faces. They had run\
  \ out of money, a common occurrence in this grand country with a fragile economy.\n\
  Buenos Aires. BA. The Big Apple. We were finally there, after a ten-hour flight,\
  \ filled with expectations of romance in this legendary city. Doug, my husband,\
  \ ever the romantic adventurer, had found our hotel on line. Located in Palermo\
  \ Viejo, a somewhat sketchy area, it lived up to its name\u2014it was, indeed muy\
  \ viejo.\nThere was no elevator. A cadre of young, strapping men whisked the luggage\
  \ up the marble spiral staircase to our rooms. The room keys were heavy, ancient\
  \ brass, vestiges of another, grander era. Leaving the hotel, we deposited our keys\
  \ at the caja. Returning, we rang the bell, since the elegant glass front doors\
  \ were always locked.  We waited nervously for a response in the wee hours, as a\
  \ half-dozen shady looking guys surveyed us from across the street.\nOn the first\
  \ night in our room, all hopes for romance or sleep were dashed, as the hotel ceiling\
  \ caved in on us, raining buckets of debris. Doug bolted from the bed, pelted by\
  \ chunks of falling gray plaster which covered his dark hair and moustache. I ran\
  \ screaming down the stairs and through the lobby, bringing startled European tourists\
  \ out onto their interior balconies, whispering in a swirl of languages\nThe proprietor\
  \ acted swifly to assess the damage, summoned wizened old men with well-worn brooms,\
  \ and moved us to a better room, on the house, for the remainder of our stay. \n\
  Through this chaos, my head rang with Andrew Lloyd Weber\u2019s lyrics from Evita.\
  \ \u201CIt was a night of a thousand stars\u201D\u2014all shining through our roof--\
  \ and \u201CAnother Suitcase, Another Hall,\u201D the perfect accompaniment as we\
  \ traipsed to our new room. \nWe have yet to make it back to BA, although we often\
  \ talk about it wistfully, particularly over a good Malbec, one with unexpected\
  \ notes of dark, delicious cherry.  It is the unexpected that makes a great memory\
  \ and a great story. We long to hear them say again, \u201CWelcome to Argentina.\u201D"
