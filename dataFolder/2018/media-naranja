Text: "Cuba is every bit the dream; a heady mix of colourful crumbling facades, rum\
  \ drenched warrens oozing salsa and reggaet\xF3n, pavement chess battles, graffitied\
  \ salutes to the revolution and bright flashes of Chevys passing. I spent the first\
  \ morning befriended and dragged from bar to bar to ogle at photos of famous visitors\
  \ and meet the city\u2019s characters, however by lunch the sun burnt through my\
  \ stamina and pocket. I longed for an interaction that captured all Cuba symbolises\
  \ and I found that in my Bicycle tour guide, Alex. We began the normal course of\
  \ the tour through Habana Vieja from Plaza Vieja to St Francis of Asis convent and\
  \ finally to the inspiring rooftop terrace of art nouveau inspired Hotel Raquel.\
  \ It was not long until we lost sight of our cultural ideals in favour of carton\
  \ clad rum, legs swinging over the Port edge. A well-timed invite from his friend\
  \ had us pedalling through the night cloaked streets of Havana\u2019s outer \u2018\
  burbs. Here we chased kids barefoot, bought necessary juice from a woman\u2019s\
  \ kitchen whilst she fried up her husband\u2019s dinner, learnt to play Dominoes\
  \ and danced to salsa. Finally I collapsed under the rhythm of my fan shortly before\
  \ the first sparks of dawn. I roused at 8am to pile into a collectivo headed to\
  \ Vi\xF1ales, Cuba\u2019s breathtaking land of karstic outcrops and ochre coloured\
  \ soil. Here I spent an unforgettable day cycling to my host, Yuri\u2019s, childhood\
  \ river. We swung into the river from a strung-up whip, shared pineapple fresh off\
  \ the farmer\u2019s carts, tossed rum in floating plastic bottles, leapt from a\
  \ bridge (something I should have left to the veterans) cycled to a backwater town\
  \ for a major concert, lay under fire flies listening to a political address and\
  \ pedalled home under cover of dark fearing our lives at each blinding light that\
  \ passed. Yuri built his entire life from house to business and taught me everything\
  \ about the surrounding lands from tobacco farming to the Cashew, in return I tried\
  \ to show him pieces of mine. We erected my tent together, experimented with my\
  \ coffee travel press and swam in a lake together as a storm rolled over the mogotes\
  \ in the distance. The Cubans taught me to embrace life\u2019s energy even in the\
  \ face of adversity, move your feet like you are alive, love like today is your\
  \ last, let your emotions flourish in your creativity and remember everyday is a\
  \ gift, never waste it."
