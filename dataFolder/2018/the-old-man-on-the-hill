Text: "I was in search of healers. Anyone who might cure my father\u2019s cancer.\
  \ It was in the small town of Mehendipur, where I heard of the Baba. \u201CHe lives\
  \ in a village near Shri Madhopur. You\u2019ll find him easily. Everyone knows Sitaram\
  \ Baba,\u201D said the tea-stall owner, as the pale brown tea bubbled and frothed\
  \ in his well-used pan. \nEarly next morning, I was on a bus to Shri Madhopur, and\
  \ much later a jeep that winded its way through an arid village. \u201CYou walk\
  \ from here,\u201D said the driver.  \u201CAlone?\u201D I exclaimed. It was pitch-dark.\
  \ A hill sloped before me, covered with a dense forest. I started walking.\nFinally,\
  \ as I came to a clearing, a man appeared. He glared at me with black-kohled eyes\
  \ and led me reluctantly into a large open courtyard. Under a sky twinkling with\
  \ a million stars sat a frail old man, dragging deeply on a chillum. \n\u201CDon\u2019\
  t be afraid,\u201D said the Baba. The kohl-eyed man showed me to a room that seemed\
  \ to be a storehouse. I lay down on a mattress in the corner. \nI awoke at dawn.\
  \ The ominous forest of the night before was now cloaked in the tenderest of greens\
  \ that burst into flames of red Goldmohurs and white Magnolias. The old baba sat\
  \ alone, still as the dawn, waiting. And then\u2026 a rustle in the trees, a clattering\
  \ on the tin roof of the little temple dedicated to the monkey god! And suddenly,\
  \ bounding in from the forest below, were dozens of long tailed monkeys. The baba\
  \ graciously offered bunches of bananas.\nAs the morning drew on, villagers trickled\
  \ in. One mother pushed her child forward. He had a stomach ache, she said. \u201C\
  Did you eat too many raw mangoes,\u201D asked the baba sternly. He brushed the boy\
  \ with his peacock feathers, chanting under his breath. I was told that ever since\
  \ the baba came to their village, nobody fell ill. \nLater, I sat with the baba,\
  \ telling him of my father\u2019s illness, of my fear of being left alone in the\
  \ world. He listened kindly. Then, reaching out for his peacock feathers, he brushed\
  \ me lightly, muttering an incantation. \u201CWhy be sorrowful about death? It is\
  \ only the ones who stay behind that are sad. For the one who goes, it is a journey\
  \ of everlasting joy!\u201D He gave me a little pouch with sacred ash for my father.\n\
  As the sun turned crimson, I walked down the green forest, away from the enchanted\
  \ world.\nMy father died soon after. Perhaps Baba is dead too. But sometimes, on\
  \ starlit nights, they come alive as I tell my tales of that unexpected wondrous\
  \ land I had stumbled upon, in my wanderings through the darkness of despair."
