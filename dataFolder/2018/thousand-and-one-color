Text: "I knew that one day I would go there. But I did not think so soon....\n\nI\
  \ was expecting a lot of things, considering my research.\nOnce there I took a beating!\
  \ \nImpressed by the country itself. My heart was pounding just at the thought of\
  \ discovering it.\nThe landscape and nature put me in full view. Human warmth is\
  \ comforting, like a mother taking her child in her arms.\nI liked the simplicity\
  \ of the people. Full of kindness and advice.\nCountry with a thousand and one color\
  \ because of its rich history, it\u2019s interbreeding, between wildlife and the\
  \ modernity that mingle.\nIt would take well over a year LoL to explore this end\
  \ of the world.\n\nWhat marked me is the availability of people to inform you, to\
  \ show you, to explain to you or even to take you out. \nThe road network is very\
  \ develop. Which allowed me to move quite easily throughout the country. \nWe eat\
  \ very well and healthily, fruits, fresh vegetables, frying, meat, fish.... there\
  \ is something for everyone.\nMy favorite... un Sancocho! Everywhere and at any\
  \ time of the day.\n\nThe country is breathtaking, not to mention monuments and\
  \ historic cities, Colombian art... and Botero and the most important thing in the\
  \ hearts of Colombians... music of course! Especially salsa! \nThis music has the\
  \ art to putting you in a good mood! And whatever the circumstances.\nI love this\
  \ life, the Colombian life. Filled with joy and color.\n\nAlso, I could recognize\
  \ myself in their belief.\nBeing a believer I benefited from several public interventions.\
  \ I was pleasantly astonished, like Bible class in the street. \nHave faith in God....\n\
  \nIt would be my biggest dream, to explore our beautiful land all my life!\n\nDelphine,\
  \ \nOne of citizen of the world."
