Text: "Compassion. Respect. Tolerance. Common Buddhist values that speak to life-long\
  \ devotees, new believers, random passers-by. They\u2019re also teasingly Instagram\
  \ worthy. Add a path of flickering lights in pitch-black darkness, or a string of\
  \ colourful flags at the cusp of dawn, and higher spiritual ideals turn to flashy\
  \ moments, tagged #blessed and #mindful, soon to be forgotten in real life. Most\
  \ travellers know Sri Pada as Adam\u2019s Peak. Its mountain top is a sacred space\
  \ for Buddhists, Christians, Muslims and Hindus. Most Sri Lankans do the pilgrimage\
  \ at least once in their lives, with many families returning every year. Old, young,\
  \ dressed in white and a pair of slippers, I can only imagine what they think of\
  \ foreign visitors covered head to toe in expensive sports gear. They come singing,\
  \ chatting, laughing out loud. Many of them on their way down, way before sunrise.\
  \ I wonder why they choose to do the whole journey at night, whether it is to avoid\
  \ the sun or visiting crowds. Close to the top, the sky starts changing colour.\
  \ The sunrise is near. I do my best to reach the summit in time. It is crowded.\
  \ I settle for a seat on the metal stairs, facing east. As I rest my head on the\
  \ cold railing, the sky is lighting up with warmer, brighter colours. My heart is\
  \ happy. Soon enough, more people are coming, wading through fellow hikers. By this\
  \ time, about as many smartphones as there are pairs of eyes wait for the sun to\
  \ rise. It finally does and soft, beautiful rays of light come shining down as far\
  \ as I can see. A few minutes later, everyone is on their feet again, hoping to\
  \ see the famous triangle shadow on the other side. It\u2019s a race with time and\
  \ good manners are left behind. The well-maintained tourist-friendly track leads\
  \ to a temple area at the top, marked with a massive information board, asking visitors\
  \ to remove their shoes as a sign of respect. Despite its size and good intentions,\
  \ it goes ignored. Nearing the main platform, people get pushy. It\u2019s understandable\
  \ in such a small space but as I try to stand steady on my feet, I notice a Sri\
  \ Lankan family, being pushed to the side. I stop, smile and let them go. Up on\
  \ the platform people split into two groups. Locals on the right, facing the pointy\
  \ peak, their eyes closed, hands clasped, quietly praying, and foreigners on the\
  \ left, turned the opposite direction, snacking. Some take pictures, once again\
  \ ignoring the boards that ask them not to. To my own surprise, I move to the right\
  \ without thinking."
