Text: "It wasn\u2019t until I had $15 to my name, an overfull rucksack and a few weeks\
  \ worth of stubble that I released the kindness of Sydneys homeless was what made\
  \ the city feel so comfortable.\n\nI had left my job in Sydney 2 months earlier\
  \ to travel the East coast, a right of passage for anyone travelling Australia that\
  \ was, as a result, a very well travelled, tourist heavy route that for me lacked\
  \ a sense of culture.\n\nDue to bad planning and the loss of my wallet I arrived\
  \ back into Sydney somewhat at a loss for where to stay. Walking out of the train\
  \ station a cacophony of sound caught my attention and, intrigued, I let myself\
  \ become distracted from my accommodation issues. I sat opposite two early 30s,\
  \ hippie looking guys who I would come to know as Carl and Freddie and listened\
  \ to them for a while. \n\nCarl fervently strummed his battered guitar, just 4 strings\
  \ remaining of the original quota. Freddie, carefully poised between what appeared\
  \ to be pieces of tat, had created himself a drum kit, an overturned chip oil bucket\
  \ serving as his bass and a box full of crisps packets comprising his snare. Their\
  \ rough, sawdust voices provided vocals over the surprisingly melodic beats and\
  \ strums. It was one of the most raw and real sounding thing I had heard since arriving\
  \ in the city 5 months earlier. \n\nI sat listening for the best part of an hour\
  \ before walking across the station entrance to ask if I could join them. They heartily\
  \ smiled and invited me to sit. They were both Australian born and talked passionately\
  \ about their music. They had met around 8 months earlier in Mackay, Queensland\
  \ and were slowly making their way back to Melbourne.\n\nThe moving sun cast strange\
  \ shadows on the pavement as we talked and jammed and as night drew in they asked\
  \ if I knew where I was staying. I told them about my plans to turn up at a friends\
  \ house a few miles out the city and they instead suggested I stay with them for\
  \ the night in their set up in a nearby park. We stopped by a bottle-o, picked up\
  \ a bottle of whiskey and some snacks with the money they had made that day from\
  \ busking and made our way there. \n\nBetween swigs of cheap whiskey they talked\
  \ with such freedom and openness that I felt instantly connected. It seemed to me\
  \ that despite the Opera House, the Harbour Bridge, Bondi beach, the botanical gardens\
  \ and a multitude of other attractions, this easy going, free spirited attitude\
  \ was what Sydney really stood for."
