Text: I was only 13, when I found out I was shifting from India to Oman. It was shocking!
  It was the first time that I ever got a transfer, and I was excited but I was not
  ready leav. My life changed, my priorities changed even my clothing style changed.
  Even though this news was shared with me like 1 month before we left, I thought
  I'd make the best time out of it. I travelled my own country, went to the places
  I love like Mumbai, Karnataka, Assam and yes how can I forget Rajasthan. I love
  cultures of different communities and different styles of living. I have a passion
  for photography, the best part was when I was on road and took pictures of people,
  the streets and yes the beautiful monuments. Oman was a place were I got the most
  unexpected things and led me to the most intriguing place I've ever seen. I never
  knew that Oman was 2hours away from Dubai, I started visualizing Oman to be pretty
  exclusive in that sense, but it wasn't. In fact it has its own beauty of Grace and
  charm. The local food (Peeta bread and Humus), the natural spices, the hand made
  clothing and the Palace. The Palace is one of the greatest things I've ever seen
  in my existance, the beauty it hold and the shine it gives,it has its own indefinable
  way to show itself. Traveling is the best gift, I feel that travelling can open
  up to boundaries that may never be seen by human eye. World is a very shy place,
  it doesn't show its true beauty until its discovered. Unexpected gifts from nature
  can change your whole perspective of living life and not the life of luxury but
  the the life of a commoner.
