Text: "With a thud I woke up. \n\nI rubbed my forehead and felt a small bump starting\
  \ to form. As my eyes began to focus I noticed six impatient faces of restless passengers\
  \ looking at me. The sharp smell of petrol filled the air and I wondered if it was\
  \ the gas or the bump making my head spin. \n\n\"Chori?\" The kind-eyed woman nestled\
  \ next to me urged me to respond. She had been offering biscuits to me the whole\
  \ ride and in exchange I'd offered my shoulder for her to rest her head.\nWith a\
  \ nod I hurriedly jumped out and grabbed my pack from the trunk of the jeep. \n\n\
  Earlier in the day when I bought my ticket for the ride down the mountain into town,\
  \ the distracted man behind the desk assured me it would take no longer than three\
  \ hours. I didn\u2019t have to look at my watch to know we were far behind schedule.\n\
  \nWhen I had finally caught my breath and looked around I noticed the street splitting\
  \ the border of the two countries was no longer as overwhelming as it had been just\
  \ three days ago. By now the customs office was closed and my visa renewal would\
  \ have to wait until tomorrow. \n\n\u201CExcuse me?\u201D\n\nI had to look around\
  \ to see where the hard raspy voice had come from. A small figure pushing a large\
  \ cart shuffled towards me. She wore a white and blue tunic, browned at the edges\
  \ with dirt. A single curl had fallen out of her veil and she quickly brushed it\
  \ away from her eyes. \n\n\u201CExcuse me,\u201D she repeated, \u201Cyou okay?\u201D\
  \ \n\u201CI\u2019m too late to cross the border. My friend is on the other side\
  \ waiting for me.\u201D \n\nShe looked towards the bridge and noticed the piece\
  \ of plywood balanced on two rocks that indicated no trespassing. \n\n\u201CAh.\
  \ Chori you need place to stay? We have bed for you.\u201D \n\nBefore I could answer,\
  \ the small figure started pushing the large cart away from the border and towards\
  \ the convent just few yards away. \n\n\u201CCome, come!\u201D she shouted without\
  \ so much as a glance over her shoulder. I took one final look around before following\
  \ suit.  \n\nThe sun had set by the time we arrived, but the light coming from the\
  \ windows overlooking the stone courtyard guided our way to the back building. Kurien\
  \ Ama showed me to a small room painted blue.A small mat laid on the floor and a\
  \ bookshelf and gas lantern stood in the corner. As I took a moment to look around\
  \ and stretch my back I felt a rough hand gently clutch mine.\n\n\u201CLeave bag\
  \ here. Time for tea.\u201D \n\nWith a nod we walked arm-in-arm through the courtyard.\
  \ A courtyard that, for this night, for this lost stranger, was safe."
