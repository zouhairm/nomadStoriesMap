Text: People although looking same have many different visuals to share, experiences
  to proudly disclose and millions of improbable emotions to express... People in
  my native land are way different than the people in new Zealand.. Maybe due to cultural
  differences, state of well being, working conditions, economical profoundness (in
  new Zealand that is), happiness and neighbours. People are humane but all cannot
  be generalized into one short set represented by a statistical vein diagram.. Although
  people should share the same humane perspective with all others, many of them are
  differently brained. In fact each one of us has a unique talent in each of us ranging
  from sports, cooking, dancing, writing, speaking, presenting, reading, scientific
  and maybe other lovely ways to express themselves. But do we all earn money doing
  what we love? Why is it so that we are forced to fall into one category knowing
  that we are quite different from one another?  This tyrannous generalization leads
  to many socio-psychological changes. People are different and have the right to
  remain so. I want to visit new Zealand to understand their perspective of such generalization
  and how they have overcome the challenge of wage per talent ,have preserved their
  nativity in forms of culture, culinary and environmental scenery.
