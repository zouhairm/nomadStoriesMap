Text: "It didn\u2019t occur to me until about two hours after landing as I was connecting\
  \ to the airport hotel\u2019s wifi for the first time: Oh, right. Google doesn\u2019\
  t work in mainland China.\nThis all-but crippled my (Android) phone\u2014no email,\
  \ no maps, no one-tap search bar, no translation. I typed \u201CBing.com\u201D into\
  \ the address bar so I could double check my destination and logged into a long-neglected\
  \ Yahoo account to shoot off a quick email to the friends I was meeting in Tokyo\
  \ the next day.\nIt was armed with a hastily-scribbled Post-it map, then, that I\
  \ made my way down three flights of escalators from the hotel to Nanjing airport\u2019\
  s metro station. Since I only had 13 total hours in the city, I\u2019d researched\
  \ sights beforehand to find one that could be explored in a hurry. The Confucius\
  \ Temple Fuzimiao seemed like the ideal option. It was historical, beautiful, and\u2014\
  importantly, since it was after 9:30pm local time when I boarded the train\u2014\
  lighted at night.\nComing out of the metro, I followed the locals and soon came\
  \ upon a pedestrian street lined with paper lanterns and street vendors. There was\
  \ the statue of Confucius, the dragon wall, and the Qinhuai River. The next hour\
  \ or so was spent happily wandering around Fuzimiao market and admiring architecture\
  \ that Epcot had exaggerated not in the slightest. I bought a scarf and a tangbao.\
  \ I also bought a tanghulu from a woman right as she was closing up shop, which,\
  \ for some reason, sent her into paroxysms of laughter. I walked away from her cart\
  \ shaking my head and spitting seeds into my napkin.\nBack at the metro, I realized\
  \ that I\u2019d spent too long sightseeing, and that I\u2019d missed the last train\
  \ back to the airport. I wished for the ease of the internet as I found myself rushing\
  \ around the station looking for any form of help. As I rounded one corner, I happened\
  \ to spot a sign for the taxi stand and breathed a sigh of relief.\nMy reprieve\
  \ was short-lived. As 20 drivers approached me, I realized that their English was\
  \ about as good as my Mandarin. I thought that they\u2019d surely know the word,\
  \ \u201Cairport,\u201D since I was certainly not the only tourist to ever visit\
  \ Nanjing, but it was only when I lifted my hand in a \u201Ctake off\u201D motion\
  \ that they all smiled and nodded at each other.\nOn the road, one of the tires\
  \ deflated and then kept deflating every 7 minutes or so; 5 times in total. In a\
  \ Google world, I\u2019d\u2019ve tried to communicate or looked to see whether this\
  \ was a con. In this country where I could only manage a \u201Cni hao,\u201D I just\
  \ shrugged."
