Text: "Night in Jogjakarta is really magical. The lights, the old buildings, and the\
  \ traditions will succesfully amazed everyone. I always feel at home while i'm driving\
  \ through the city. That's probably the reason why people keep coming back here.\n\
  \n\"It's gonna rain tho..\" Bella says.\n \nAs she predicted, the raindrop start\
  \ to fall on our face, I race the scooter faster. We have to reach there before\
  \ the rain getting heavier.\n\n\"It supposed to be few meters from here.\"  as she\
  \ told me to slow down.\n\nGoogle maps on her hand leading us to a small cart on\
  \ the side walk. Reality bites us, the honorable wedang ronde paiyem doesnt seems\
  \ as legendary as the travel site says. It\u2019s more sad and gloomy than what\
  \ we expected. No electricity, only oil lamp and a worn-out tarpaullin canopy saving\
  \ us from the heavy rain. There is nobody but an old lady holding her wooden cart.\
  \ Even my grandma was not old enough to reach this woman age at the time she passed\
  \ away.  \n\nI steal glance on Bella\u2019s watch, it almost 11.00 pm. The air is\
  \ getting cold and colder, our clothes getting soggy and we can feel the water start\
  \ pooling inside our shoes.  \n\n\u201CMbah, tiyang purun numbas wedang ronde ne\
  \ kalih nggih..\u201D as Bella asked  in a polite javanese language. I relized the\
  \ woman doesnt speak Indonesian. \n\nWedang ronde is a dessert made from glutinous\
  \ rice powder which formed into balls, filled with melted brown sugar and poured\
  \ with boiled ginger water. It also topped with roasted peanut crumbles and pinkish\
  \ \u2018kolang-kaling\u2019. \n\nThe old lady start to prepare our order, even with\
  \ shivering hand she arrange each ingredients finely. The spicy scent spreading\
  \ when she pours the ginger water. The wamrth of the cup and the cold from her fingers\
  \ can be sensed while she is handing over our wedang ronde.\n\nIt's the time for\
  \ us to enjoy our appetizing warm dessert while listening to the old lady stories.\
  \ She is describing the good and bad living long enough to see many things in life.\
  \ She also tell us how our long dead mister president used to be her costumer and\
  \ having the same wedang ronde as we have today."
