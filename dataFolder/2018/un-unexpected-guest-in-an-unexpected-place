Text: "Jan 4th 2017, my 21st birthday and i decided to present myself with a trip\
  \ to Manali in India, a beautiful hill station, been aware of an article I recently\
  \ discovered in a travel magazine influenced the travel enthusiast in me. Approaching\
  \ examination made almost every mate of mine to decline the ideology behind the\
  \ trip. But as determined i was to make this trip happen made me go further with\
  \ the preparations for it and guess what i was about to be on a voyage all alone\
  \ to an unknown destination. Later which made me realize was a best decision i could\
  \ ever make.\nAll set up for leaving the home in a day i was excited for this amazing\
  \  roller coaster ride coming ahead. John a friend of mine who had been to Manali\
  \ prior gave me those useful words which made this trip a little hassle free.\n\
  FINALLY THE DAY OF ARRIVAL Mom and dad like any other parents were concerned for\
  \ me in this lonely trip.\nI bid them goodbye and left for a place and journey which\
  \ i would tell the generations to come.\nThe excitement made me to be at the railway\
  \ station an hour before than the expected time.\nGetting into my train, i started\
  \ my first page of the dairy regarding the trip. People were traveling to varied\
  \ destinations, some for holidays, some with work but travel was thing which we\
  \ had in common. I saw the clouds and trees passing by making me realize a fact\
  \ \u201Cthe time gone was never to come back\u201D AT THE DESTINATION I could feel\
  \ the chills in the ambience, air was gushing into my lungs comprehending how pure\
  \ it was. I took deep breaths now. Heading to the hotel i learned the snow covered\
  \ the patches of grass lands resembled the chaste and the mistic dew drops settled\
  \ on the leaves were drippling themselves to the early morning sun. Agenda was prepared\
  \ and time was set. AN UNKNOWN GUEST Unloading my bags at hotel room I headed out\
  \ to explore the local visual treats. Things are not always as beautiful as they\
  \ appear to be and i learned this quite well when I was about to be tricked by a\
  \ paid travel guide when she arrived to save me, a girl named Deepa. She helped\
  \ her dad in their local food stall. Purest of love and cleanest of the heart was\
  \ what she was like this place. May be we were meant to be friends and by the glance\
  \ of our eyes we were. Deepa helped me explore the local destinations with her mesmerising\
  \ smile & inviting me for the supper. Delicacies were what i got to eat. Next day\
  \ i was of to another location, happy and in a hope to see her back some day when\
  \ i return."
