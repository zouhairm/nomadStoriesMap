Text: "I awake on the floor of my 1920\u2019s Parisian flat, my face bloodied and\
  \ my limbs sore. My roommate, neighbor, and two paramedics stand in front of me,\
  \ with the landlord by the entrance.\n\n\u201CWhat\u2019s your name? Qu\u2019est\
  \ que ton nom?\u201D I don't know. \u201CDo you know what day it is? Quel jour est-il?\u201D\
  \ I don't know that either.\n\nAfter a few minutes, the morning slowly creeps back\
  \ to me. I was brushing my teeth and then washing my face. Then I wasn\u2019t. I\
  \ look down and see that I am wearing pajamas, which are now stained with blood.\
  \ I realize that I had fallen face-first onto the creaky hardwood floor. \n\n\u201C\
  You had a seizure,\u201D my roommate tells me. I listen and don't deny what had\
  \ been said but don't accept it either. \n\nI am unable to walk, so the paramedics\
  \ lift me onto a wooden chair and carry me out to the elevator, which only fits\
  \ one person, so they run down seven flights of stairs to meet me at the bottom.\n\
  \nOut on the curb, a stretcher and ambulance wait for me, and the passersby on the\
  \ streets of Paris are un-phased. They\u2019ve seen it before, just a daily part\
  \ of their routine.\n\nMy roommate meets me in the ER. She\u2019s too panicked to\
  \ speak French to the doctors, so she calls the Head of the Study Abroad Program,\
  \ who then rushes to the hospital. The doctors give me an MRI and then announce\
  \ that my life will now be different forever. \u201CTu es \xE9pileptique.\u201D\
  \ My hormone levels have changed and have affected my brain. They prescribe me medication\
  \ that makes me so tired that I'm floating. \n\nThere were times when I wanted to\
  \ join the others, roaming the city streets and soaking in everything the light\
  \ of the night had to offer, but instead stayed within the dark closed curtains\
  \ of my room. Still, I never let my disorder take Paris completely away from me.\
  \  I still ran through the parks. I still stormed through the museums. I still shopped\
  \ at the markets. I still sat on benches in the snow. I still stomped through the\
  \ rain on my way to class.\n\nI allowed myself to sleep on those nights when all\
  \ I wanted to do was walk and run and twirl and laugh and be Parisian and live life\
  \ the Parisian way. Paris taught me not just to survive the hard times, but also\
  \ to fill my life with experiences in spite of them.\n\nUltimately, my need to dance\
  \ overtook my sickness to leave, and I chose to stay. Even though I was dreaming\
  \ it away, at least it was Paris that I was dreaming."
