Text: "Mountains are spectacular and unpredictable! 4 of us, set out on a 6 day trek\
  \ to conquer the Pangarchulla peak at 14,700ft! These mountains lie in the Indo-Tibetan\
  \ border, in the Uttrakhand region of India. We started from Rishikesh, the yoga\
  \ capital of the world, drove for 10 hours to a quaint village called Joshimatt,\
  \ from here we started climbing on foot. Our entourage included 4 mules, 2 cooks,\
  \ 2 guides and 2 mule boys, who kept us well fed, constantly hydrated and carried\
  \ our tents & luggage. Adherence to the schedule, driven by a tough guide ensured\
  \ we stuck to the plan; a very critical ask in the harsh mountain environment!\n\
  Most mornings the bells on the mules woke me up. I would unzip the tent to find\
  \ the endless silhouette of the sturdy, still mountains staring back; the sun would\
  \ start shining on the tallest snow peaks and gradually the blanket of rays would\
  \ cover every single mountain! This breathtaking taking view with a hot cup of tea\
  \ was followed by a visit to the Red toilet tent; a hole and a tissue roll! Knack,\
  \ technique and good positioning was important to target the hole; aching and shaking\
  \ legs, bitter cold, wind and sudden startling animal noises, added to the complexities\
  \ of pooping! We would then wash, dress, pack up and begin walking across a terrain\
  \ that varied every single day: pebbles, mud, dense green jungle with tall trees,\
  \ muddy puddles with melting snow, soggy grassy lands and eventually large rocky\
  \ boulders in the last 2000ft. \nThe precarious narrow paths were shared with the\
  \ locals and mules (with bells around their necks). Being attentive to bell sounds\
  \ and knowing which toxic bush, to avoid plunging into (unless you want to get knocked\
  \ down by a mule travelling downhill hastily) is a must! Sturdy old women, carrying\
  \ huge bundles of grass on their back with Steel Grey eyes, fine lines, gentle smiles\
  \ and little kids with pink cheeks and dried lips, herding baby lambs crossed our\
  \ paths often. Banter, mostly encouraging us, ensued at every break!\nExtreme temperature\
  \ variations, very little sleep, unpredictable terrain coupled with depleting oxygen\
  \ levels and 16 hours of non-stop walking with an infected wound on my inner right\
  \ thigh, made the second last day, one the most strenuous in my life! I remember\
  \ tearing up from extreme exhaustion! I dare say, my body had given up but my heart\
  \ was not willing to! The things the mountains let me discover about myself were\
  \ unexpected and priceless...I look forward to my next adventure!"
