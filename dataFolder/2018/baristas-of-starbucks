Text: "Less than two hours after graduating from Penn State, I boarded a plane bound\
  \ for Cannes, France. I spent two weeks attending movie premieres, drinking wine\
  \ on the beach with new friends and interning at the Cannes Film Festival. \n\n\
  Ultimately, adulthood was waiting for me back in the United States. I was no longer\
  \ able to jump from one experience to the next like I often did in college. \n\n\
  Before I left for France, I had secured a job at Starbucks. When I brewed that first\
  \ batch of Pike or served my first caramel macchiato, I never imagined working at\
  \ Starbucks two years later.\n\nThe most positive aspect of working at Starbucks\
  \ is the people you meet. I formed connections with my co-workers and supervisors\
  \ that I would have never predicted. \n\nWhen I transferred to a store in Chicago,\
  \ I started reflecting on the baristas I have met. All the stories to be told that\
  \ most customers don\u2019t bother to hear. \n\nI started conducting interviews,\
  \ both with my co-workers in Chicago and Pennsylvania. I then transcribed them and\
  \ posted them on my WordPress blog, \u201CBaristas of Starbucks.\u201D \n\nMost\
  \ people I've interviewed have never been interviewed before. They\u2019re surprised\
  \ you want to hear what they have to say. \n\nI correspond the quotes with a photograph\
  \ of the barista. Behind the green apron, we\u2019re people too. We\u2019ve had\
  \ experiences, we have emotions and we struggle. \n\nSince I began interviewing\
  \ baristas, I\u2019ve learned more about societal issues I didn\u2019t previously\
  \ understand. I've gained a perspective on my own life, understanding where my problems\
  \ fall into the realm of other peoples\u2019 struggles. \n\nMy first interview was\
  \ with a barista who donated pastries and coffee to a women\u2019s homeless shelter.\
  \ The shelter took her in when she had no where else to go. \n\nAnother one of my\
  \ friends informed me about her transition. She told me that for the first time\
  \ in her life, she recognizes herself in the mirror. \n\nThis blog has not only\
  \ opened up my mind to new ideas and ways of thinking, but it\u2019s been an exciting\
  \ challenge to work on my writing and photography aspirations. \n\nWhat's most important\
  \ is it provides me with an opportunity to tell stories. I\u2019m giving a voice\
  \ to these baristas and I feel like I\u2019m making a real difference, rather than\
  \ solely serving coffee behind the counter. \n\nIf someone had told me two years\
  \ ago that I would still be working at Starbucks, I would have laughed at them.\
  \ Now, I feel it\u2019s precisely where I was supposed to end up."
