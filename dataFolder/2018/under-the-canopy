Text: "\u201CAhhh!\u201D  I shrieked. \n\nAfter dusk as we stood under the canopy\
  \ of the Daintree National Rainforest, I felt something fall from above and land\
  \ on my leg.\n \nNo more than a second later, one of my fellow night tour explorers\
  \ swiped at my leg as we watched the culprit land at my feet.\n\n\u201CThat there\
  \ is a Bull Ant.  It\u2019s lucky your buddy got to him before he took a big chunk\
  \ out of you!\u201D exclaimed our guide ironically named, Steve.  I say ironic because\
  \ the level of his enthusiasm matched that of the late, Steve Irwin.\n\n\u201CLucky\
  \ me,\u201D I thought to myself as I, a city dweller who gets weak in the knees\
  \ at the sight of a common cockroach, began to have second thoughts about going\
  \ on this nighttime adventure. \n\nAt this point, it was Steve\u2019s contagious\
  \ love for this 180 million year old rainforest that kept me going.\n\nAs we explored\
  \ the land, home to Davidson Plums that is food for the Cassowary Bird, Stinging\
  \ Trees whose heart shaped leaves appear harmless but are as painful as they sound\
  \ if you touch them, Wait-A-While Vines that can trap you or tear you to shreds\
  \ with their spikes, and the quirky Idoit Fruit; I couldn\u2019t help but brush\
  \ my leg every few seconds just to make sure no more visitors were occupying my\
  \ body.\n\nAs we saw a pair of enormous Stag Horn Beetles mating on the side of\
  \ a tree trunk, Huntsman Spiders that were the size of my face, Scorpions, Stick\
  \ Bugs, White Kneed Crickets and more, my fears intensified.\n\nAfter seeing a Centipede\
  \ the size of a banana, Steve had us huddle in a small circle, turn off our torches\
  \ and experience the forest floor sans light.  \n\nAs darkness engulfed us, Steve\
  \ shared the story of an 80 year old woman who got lost at dusk only to find herself\
  \ having no other choice but to sleep on the rainforest floor and wait for daylight.\
  \  To our surprise, she survived the ordeal without so much as a scratch.  It was\
  \ then I figured, if she could survive that, I\u2019ll survive this and I decided\
  \ to enjoy the rest of this ride.\n\nThankfully I did, otherwise I would\u2019ve\
  \ missed out on the curious sight of a normally green Boyd\u2019s Dragon turned\
  \ beat red, clinging to a tree with it\u2019s mouth wide open, blowing off steam\
  \ after a ferocious encounter with another Boyd\u2019s Dragon.  The Golden Orb Spider\
  \ that weaves surreal webs of a golden hue enchanted me.  The final magical moment\
  \ of the evening was standing in the middle of a paved road, torches off, stars\
  \ above, silent as can be, as we watched micro bats fly all around us and into the\
  \ night sky."
