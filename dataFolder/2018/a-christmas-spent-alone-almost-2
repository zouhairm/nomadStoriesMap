Text: "19 years old on an overseas internship from university all alone for the first\
  \ time living in Tainan city (Taiwan). A city filled with beautiful people but a\
  \ lack of English restricts me from bonding with both people and the city. It\u2019\
  s the morning of Christmas Eve and for the first time, there is no one around, no\
  \ friends, no family and colleagues with screaming toddlers too busy to celebrate\
  \ Christmas. Since Taipei is the city packed with youngsters who are still motivated\
  \ and aspired drinkers/party animals. I knew that is where I need to be but it\u2019\
  s a five-hour train ride away.\nWalking into the train station, sitting on the platform\
  \ wondering if I should do this? Many questions came screaming into my mind. I don\u2019\
  t know anyone or speak the language etc. As I scroll through Instagram pondering\
  \ whether I should give into the fear that is starting to make me numb. Telling\
  \ myself \u2018Christmas alone, can\u2019t be that bad\u2019. The announcer reiterates,\
  \ train to Taipei leaves in 5 minutes. While contemplating whether to give up and\
  \ go home, I accidentally scroll onto a quote on Instagram \u201CTwenty years from\
  \ now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn\u2019t do than by\
  \ the ones you did\u201D \u2013 Mark Twain. Inspired by this strong quote and driven\
  \ with a hope to make memories I get onto the train. \nAfter five hours, the train\
  \ came to a halt. My heart skipped a beat. It was real now. Walking through the\
  \ station of Taipei completely lost. Staring at the ceiling slightly shocked/scared\
  \ at how big the Taipei railway station was compared to Tainan city. \nAs I exited\
  \ the platform, I saw an empty bench where I sat down. Wild thoughts clamored through\
  \ my mind wondering if this was a mistake and whether to catch the train back to\
  \ Tainan city before it\u2019s too late. I thought about that quote and mustered\
  \ all my courage and decided to start walking in any random direction.   \nAs I\
  \ was walking I get approached by a stranger wondering If I was new to this city.\
  \ We happened to be from the same country and spoke the same mother tongue. He had\
  \ been residing in Taiwan for two years studying Mandarin and knew the city like\
  \ the back of his hand. He offered to show me around and I said yes, exhaling with\
  \ relief.  It turned out to be an amazing night, filled with new and unexpected\
  \ experiences. After an extremely eventful night, I was waiting for the first train\
  \ back to Tainan city with a box of fried dumplings and a huge smile on my face\
  \ saying to myself this is the best Christmas I have ever had\u2026 (yet)."
