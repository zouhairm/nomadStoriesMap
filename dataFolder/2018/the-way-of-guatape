Text: "I arrived in Medellin without my luggage or a clear plan of how I would get\
  \ to the one place I planned to go. I wanted to spend my time in Colombia without\
  \ an agenda so that my path could unfold organically; so that I could live completely\
  \ opposite of my 'normal', without a plan and with a completely open schedule. One\
  \ of the only things I had arranged was a work trade at a motorcycle and scooter\
  \ rental place in a town I had never heard of. I didn't know anyone who had been\
  \ there, had only a little contact with my hosts before arriving, and had never\
  \ driven a motorcycle or scooter. The sole intention that I held for my trip was\
  \ to find my edges, and to step beyond them. I figured out the bus to Guatape. I\
  \ was eager to get outside of the bustle of a large city. On the way into town I\
  \ noticed the vibrant and three dimensional zocalos that colored the charming pueblo.\
  \ I arrived and started walking in the direction of Guatape Motos, not knowing exactly\
  \ where it was, carrying my pack, guitar, yoga mat, and smaller bag. Yes, I had\
  \ packed way too much. I arrived looking like a pack mule. My hosts greeted me and\
  \ took me to their apartment, where I'd be sharing space with three, four, sometimes\
  \ five strangers for the foreseeable future. I quickly discovered that there were\
  \ many transplants populating Guatape\u2014French, Americans, Germans, Argentinians.\
  \ It was an eclectic tourist town much like the town I had been calling home in\
  \ California for two years, only Spanish speaking and with fewer rules. I put my\
  \ stuff down and was taken on the classic route that they send their customers on.\
  \ I suited up in riding gear and, feeling like a badass, drove a scooter, for my\
  \ first time, along a beautiful, winding road connecting Guatape to the smaller,\
  \ authentic Colombian town of San Raphael. We stopped along the way so I could take\
  \ in the incredible views of the valley of my new home. We ended our little sample\
  \ tour at Rio Bizcocho, where locals camp and hang out on a beach in the river.\
  \ I couldn't quite believe this would be what my days consisted of for the coming\
  \ weeks. I had been working for the last nine months with children as a school-based\
  \ psychotherapist, hearing stories of abuse, neglect, and difficulties navigating\
  \ the social world of American youth daily. Now I got to experience a life where\
  \ my only concern was not losing my grip on my handles, rather than my sanity. After\
  \ my first ride, my host and guide told me I did well, but I would need to learn\
  \ to drive faster."
