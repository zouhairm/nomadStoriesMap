Text: "\u201CAndiamo! Or as you say in the English, let\u2019s go!\u201D said Giuliana\
  \ as she led us into the crowded room. She had told us about him but this was the\
  \ moment we would see him for the first time. As I walked through the crowd to get\
  \ a closer look, I was struck by his commanding presence and sculpture\u2019s exquisite\
  \ detail \u2013 the laughter lines on his face, the accentuated leg muscles, the\
  \ veins protruding from his hands.\n\nMy day began a few hours ago in Florence\u2019\
  s Piazza San Marco. My friend and I were the only Aussies in a motley crew of tourists\
  \ from more countries than an international buffet at the local RSL. Giuliana arrived\
  \ looking as fashionable and Italian as I expected. With her Gucci sunglasses propped\
  \ on her head and her Versace scarf twirling in the breeze, she looked like she\
  \ had stepped off the runway at Milan Fashion Week. She introduced herself and announced\
  \ in accented English that we were about to be transported into the Renaissance\
  \ era.\n\nWe made our way to Florence Cathedral, an intimidating yet intricately\
  \ designed church. At approximately 115 metres tall and with a large, recognisable\
  \ dome, it dominates the piazza and shows Florence who\u2019s boss. The fa\xE7ade\
  \ is made of green, white and red marble and the walls are crowded with elaborate\
  \ arches, statues and carvings. The church took 140 years to complete the vision\
  \ created by Arnolfo di Cambio in 1294. It was humbling to stand in front of a building\
  \ that was first imagined over 700 years ago.\n\n\u201CNow we go to one of the best\
  \ places to eat in Firenze!\u201D said Giuliana as she led us to an alfresco pizza\
  \ place full of people enjoying the summer breeze. \u201CIf you don\u2019t like-a\
  \ pizza, you can go over there to have a pasta.\u201D I opted for pizza and didn\u2019\
  t regret it - the Margherita pizza smelt of fresh olive oil and peppery basil. As\
  \ I took a bite, the sweet tomato juices dribbled down my chin and the delicate,\
  \ milky mozzarella created an oozy, stretchy mess.\n\nAfter our mouth-watering meal,\
  \ we strolled over to the Galleria dell\u2019Accademia, home to some of the world\u2019\
  s most famous art. Giuliana fleetingly named some of the works housed there and\
  \ then mentioned the pi\xE8ce de r\xE9sistance that we were frothing at the mouth\
  \ to see \u2013 Michelangelo\u2019s David. \u201CMost people are surprised at how\
  \ small he is\u201D she warned. Immediately, I was a little disappointed. Wasn\u2019\
  t he supposed to be a mammoth of a sculpture considering his reputation?\n\n\u201D\
  But you decide for yourselves eh?\u201D she added and led us in with a loud and\
  \ excited \u201CAndiamo!\u201D"
