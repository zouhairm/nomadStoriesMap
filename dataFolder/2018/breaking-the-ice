Text: "The invitation had come as a surprise, from a friend of a friend. Spending\
  \ the weekend in northern Iceland, at a museum dedicated to tracing the emigrations\
  \ of the 19th and 20th centuries, seemed an incredible gift. I\u2019d accepted,\
  \ and my host had dropped me off with the key, advising me that his cousin lived\
  \ just up the street, if I needed anything.\n\nThough only a four-hour drive, Hofs\xF3\
  s was a world away from Reykjav\xEDk. The snow was struck with sun in the brief\
  \ daylight hours, and mountains rose above fields of horses. Eider ducks grunted\
  \ and cooed as they floated close to shore. The cold that day had been breathtaking,\
  \ the sharp cold that Reykjav\xEDk almost never had. I was looking forward to the\
  \ leftover macaroni and cheese I\u2019d hastily packed. A cup of tea, and a bit\
  \ of reading, I thought \u2014 that would make a pleasant evening.\n\nImagine my\
  \ distress, then, when I discovered that the cheese had gone quite mouldy.\n\nI\
  \ cursed at it for some minutes, then, realising that that would do no good, I considered\
  \ my options. I could live on what I had, of course. It wasn\u2019t much \u2014\
  \ and it wouldn\u2019t leave me any breakfast. I couldn\u2019t go shopping, not\
  \ now that the shop was closed. I couldn\u2019t go out to supper, the only restaurant\
  \ being closed for the season. Last night\u2019s gas station fish and chips \u2014\
  \ a roadside stop \u2014 was only a wistful memory.\n\nThere was only one thing\
  \ for it. I had to throw myself on the mercy of the neighbours. I knocked on my\
  \ host's cousin's door, holding my breath and hoping she was at home. Introducing\
  \ myself in halting Icelandic-English, I explained my plight.\n\n\"Would you like\
  \ to stay for supper?\" I nodded, gratefully relieved. \"The priest is coming tonight,\"\
  \ she explained, unfazed by the extra guest. \"You can join us.\"\n\n\u201CIsn\u2019\
  t there anything I can do to help?\u201D I asked, eager to show myself a good guest\
  \ and no helpless tourist.\n\n\"No, no. You can relax.\" If I can remember how,\
  \ I thought to myself. She showed me to the living room and set to cooking something\
  \ delicious.\n\nHer eleven-year-old daughter chatted away to me, using slow, patient\
  \ Icelandic so that even I could understand. She sometimes threw in English words,\
  \ but her conversation was in her native language, and she trusted me to keep up.\
  \ By the time dinner was served, I was practically fluent. No class or study session\
  \ had accomplished as much.\n\nThe fluency didn't last once I returned to class,\
  \ but for that dinner, I felt at ease. A bit of mould had broken the ice where I\
  \ never could."
