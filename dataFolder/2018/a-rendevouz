Text: "Not many people would have heard about the place i am going to talk about in\
  \ the next few paragraphs. We came across it in an article when we were researching\
  \ for an upcoming trip to Norway. The article spoke about an island called Svalvard,\
  \ that was, quite interestingly, the SECOND NORTHERNMOST HABITABLE place in the\
  \ world. Situated just 1000 kms from North pole, it looked unlike any other place\
  \ i had ever seen. It was a land of snow mountains and glacial fjords. A place where\
  \ nobody is allowed to be buried because the bodies never decompose. Interesting.\n\
  It was then experiencing a 24 hours daylight and temperatures as low as -20C. There\
  \ was practically nothing to do except for sledge-rides & snow-bikes excursions.\
  \ But then, on a few longer excursions, there was also a minute possibility to spot\
  \ a polar bear. Very minute, but enough to send us packing our bags.\nNow the moment\
  \ we landed, we realised that it wasn't going to be easy. The freezing winds made\
  \ it difficult to stay outdoors even for 10 minutes, let alone take a 10 hour journey\
  \ on a snow scooter. It seemed no mean feat to achieve but the decision had been\
  \ made long back & nothing less than watching a polar bear in its natural habitat\
  \ would have done. The next day we left early in the morning with our group. For\
  \ the first couple of hours, the adrenaline rush was high and the world was beautiful.\
  \ But as time passed, the excitement began to fade & reality began to seep in. We\
  \ were wearing snowsuits & not an inch of the flesh was exposed to air. But still,\
  \ every now and then, somehow the wind managed to make its way through & numb some\
  \ body part \nAfter 5 hours of a bumpy ride, we still hadn\u2019t spotted a bear.\
  \ The sun and disappointment both were beginning to set in, when all of a sudden,\
  \ the group leader spotted something. It was a polar bear! We had finally spotted\
  \ a polar bear!\nAnd if not impossible, it\u2019s difficult to express what happened\
  \ after that. The chill of the winds, the mad hunger and the bodyache, all felt\
  \ in service of that one moment. Watching the bear lazying with its kids, from a\
  \ distance, felt nothing less than a private, romantic rendezvous.\nThe fact that\
  \ there were only two sets of binoculars in a group of 8 people, i didn\u2019t get\
  \ to look at them infinitely, but any amount of time would have anyway never felt\
  \ enough. On my way back, i kept picturing that moment while thinking if that\u2019\
  s what travel is really meant for. Pushing oneself beyond boundaries in the pursuit\
  \ of extraordinary."
