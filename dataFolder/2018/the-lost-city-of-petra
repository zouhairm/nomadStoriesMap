Text: "As we stood by the roadside watching the dusty pickup disappear, my sister\
  \ Jackie gave me that look - the what the hell have you gotten us into now? look.\n\
  \nI couldn\u2019t blame her.  The potholed road snaking through the desert was the\
  \ only sign of human habitation in any direction.\n\nA fellow traveller at our Amman\
  \ hostel heard me grumbling about Petra\u2019s hefty entry fee and told me how to\
  \ get in the \u201Cback\u201D way for free.  All we had to do was travel a few kilometres\
  \ along the road to Umm Sayhoun, then hike a few hours to Petra's northern limits.\
  \  It sounded so easy over a beer.\n\nWe headed towards the hills, clambering and\
  \ sometimes slipping down the steep, rocky embankment.  Our hands were grazed and\
  \ our butts bruised by the time we reached the bottom.  It was equally tricky navigating\
  \ the uneven ground on the valley floor but at least the cliffs shaded us from the\
  \ blazing sun.\n\nWhen we exited the valley a few hours later, there were no majestic\
  \ tombs carved into rock faces, only flat, sandy desert stretching to the horizon.\
  \  Unwilling to admit defeat, I suggested we keep going.  Jackie was too tired to\
  \ argue.\n\nWe kept to the shadows at the edge of the ridge.  Rounding a bend, we\
  \ came across a Bedouin family who\u2019d set up camp for lunch.  The camels standing\
  \ nearby looked at us languidly through long lashes.\n\nThe toothless grandmother\
  \ stirred her chicken feet stew in a blackened pot over the fire.  Her gnarled hands\
  \ gestured that we share it but we smiled and shook our heads, showing her the sandwiches\
  \ in our backpacks.  She shrugged.\n\nWe ate our lunch on logs around the fire with\
  \ the Bedouins, our comic attempts at communication with charades punctuated by\
  \ contemptuous grunts from the camels.  When we shared our oranges afterwards, there\
  \ were crooked grins all round.\n\nWe didn\u2019t want our magical, money-can\u2019\
  t-buy experience to end but the sun was dropping quickly so it was time to head\
  \ back.  Being lost in the desert in the dark definitely wasn\u2019t on our itinerary.\
  \  We said goodbye to our new friends and retraced our steps.\n\nAs darkness fell,\
  \ we were back at the road where we\u2019d begun, grubby and exhausted, but thrilled\
  \ by our adventure.  A passing truck saved us the long walk back to the comforts\
  \ of Wadi Musa.\n\nAs we happily purchased our tickets at the Visitor Centre the\
  \ next morning, the woman on the counter smiled and said \"What a shame you didn\u2019\
  t come yesterday\".\n\n\"It was the King's birthday\" she explained before delivering\
  \ the punch line \"and entry was free!\""
