Text: "As I put on my life jacket, helmet and gas mask I look back on the mainland.\
  \ The small city Whatakane lies behind me with its colourful buildings, surrounded\
  \ by gentle green hills and an ocean so blue and clear it still amazes me after\
  \ I\u2019ve seen several dozen of beaches in this country. Whereas our boat steers\
  \ towards something that rather seems like a moon landscape \u2013 grey and white\
  \ as the name says it. Behind a thick layer of mist New Zealand\u2019s most active\
  \ volcano island, White Island or as the Maori say \u201Cthe dramatic volcano\u201D\
  , is awaiting us. \nDramatic and dark is what I expect. As a huge fan of \u201C\
  The Chronicles of Narnia\u201D I\u2019ve seen the steaming rocks and the wild ocean\
  \ before. In reality it\u2019s my first time on a volcano island at all and I\u2019\
  m trying to dissemble my nervousness now that we left the safe haven. \n\nWe conquer\
  \ the last meters that separate us from the black ground. Helicopters rattle above\
  \ our heads as they bring their passengers onto the island. When we first set foot\
  \ my friend and fellow traveller Gloria whispers into my ear: \u201CI don\u2019\
  t think there\u2019s any living being in this place besides us\u201D. Oh, how wrong\
  \ we were. The pungent smell of sulphur rises up to my nose and I pull the mask\
  \ over my face. As a majority of the island lays under water, our guides lead us\
  \ directly to the crater. On our way around we come across a wide colour gamut:\
  \ yellowish and brick-red hillsides create a contrast to the lava-burned underground.\
  \ We become aware of the diversity this island holds in despite of its sparseness.\
  \ We are told that the flora and fauna re-colonize every time after being dispersed\
  \ in an eruption, which at last occurred in 2001. A gannet colony attracts our attention\
  \ and with a closer look we recognize grasses and even some us unknown flowers on\
  \ the coast.\nWe taste the \u201Cvolcano juices\u201D - streams that pave their\
  \ way from the inside of the craters to the shore. Some taste like iron and are\
  \ lukewarm while others have a cold bitter taste. Everywhere around us steam escapes\
  \ the ground with loud hisses and we have to watch our steps. Although we don\u2019\
  t have to wear our masks all the time I constantly hold it onto my mouth.\n\nWandering\
  \ through what\u2019s left of unsuccessful attempts to mine sulphur, we surprisingly\
  \ find a Puhutukawa \u2013 New Zealand\u2019s very own Christmas tree, still very\
  \ young and not higher than one meter, growing in the ruins of the old factory.\
  \ In between its branches blossoms a single flower \u2013 a sign of life in a place\
  \ no one expected to find one."
