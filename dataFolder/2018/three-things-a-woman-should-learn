Text: "Vespas whizz past, horns beeping, driver\u2019s fists waving and I breathe\
  \ in the sweet smell of the orange blossom lining the cobbled streets of Rome. Which\
  \ cafe to choose? I settle for a local\u2019s cafe, run by a father and son. Businessmen\
  \ stand at the bar, gesticulating over a football match playing on a small television.\n\
  The only woman, I feel out of place so decide to order a cappuccino and retreat\
  \ to the terrace. Next to me an older woman sits at a table, puffing on a cigarette\
  \ whilst reading the newspaper. Dressed to impress in a brown fur coat, pearl necklace\
  \ and black leather gloves, with permed hair and rouged lips, she radiates class\
  \ and old Italian glamour. She sighs at the day\u2019s news and looks over.\nDeducing\
  \ from my blonde hair that I am not Italian, she addresses me in English. She tells\
  \ me that she is 72, from Naples, has had numerous husbands, no children, and has\
  \ lived in Rome for the last 20 years in the splendour of her ex-husband\u2019s\
  \ penthouse overlooking the Vatican. She asks me about my life, my time spent in\
  \ Rome and my opinion of the Italian men. \u2018The men?!\u2019 I ask shocked. \u2018\
  Yes, the men. What do you think of them?\u2019 Trying to be polite I reply \u2018\
  Well, yes, they seem nice, and the women too\u2019. She throws her head back and\
  \ laughs. \u2018I disagree\u2019 she exclaims. \u2018The men are idiots and the\
  \ women are fools\u2019. I laugh awkwardly and try to change the subject but she\
  \ doesn\u2019t allow it.\n\u2018I have three pieces of advice for you\u2019 she\
  \ says leaning in towards me. I feel as though she is about to impart some womanly\
  \ wisdom, the type you pass on to your daughters and granddaughters. \u2018There\
  \ are three things a woman should learn\u2019, she begins. \u2018Firstly, she should\
  \ learn politics. She should know what she believes in and how to fight for it.\
  \ Secondly, she should learn how to sell something. You never know when you will\
  \ be without a husband, work, and far from home. Learning to sell will solve any\
  \ financial problems you may face. Finally, she should learn how to be an actress.\
  \ To know how to use her attitude and behaviour to be attractive to a man, to fool\
  \ him, to win\u2019. \nIt is very rare in life that we have the luck to meet a woman\
  \ like Theresa. As a young woman learning life and the ways in which to deal with\
  \ the hurdles I come across as a woman, it is inspiring to meet such a powerful\
  \ person. If she can so fabulously survive the trials and tribulations experienced\
  \ by many women in a fascist and post-fascist Italy, then I too can survive and\
  \ prosper in this man\u2019s world."
