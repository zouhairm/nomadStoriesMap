Text: "Since I was little, I was happy to be where I am. \nAt the age of ten, I thought\
  \ my life was at his quintessence, I lived everyday for myself. I wasn't aware of\
  \ the others. \nAt the of eighteen, I had big expectations for the rest of my life.\
  \ But at this time, everything felt apart. I became very shy and could speak freely\
  \ with my friends, I was afraid of what they were thinking of me. Since then, I'd\
  \ lived a life planned by my family. I went day after day with controversial feelings.\
  \ I laugh every single day because I love Life but I also cry every week because\
  \ I don't find the meaning of it. The shy girl wanted to become a traveler and find\
  \ herself again.\nIn a late January, after missing my flight, I arrived in Norway\
  \ at three pm, but the night was already really dark. The airport was small and\
  \ only one bus was waiting. I was going in a little town with a name I couldn't\
  \ pronounce to the driver. An hour later, I was at a gas station near the campus.\
  \ A snow storm covered all the road in white, I'd never seen so much of. After a\
  \ fantastic walk, I was alone, happy, the journey to find myself began. I arrived\
  \ in a six rooms apartment on the campus. At the precise moment, I didn't know that\
  \ the other five people I would meet will make my life better. I first talk to Lina,\
  \ 26, from Austria. Nice face but cold. Then arrived Martha from Poland. Tall, red\
  \ hair, great smile. Then came, Arkan, 33, Irakian; Sunny, 27, from Pakistan and\
  \ the greatest Italian girl, Alessandra, 22. They became my family for more than\
  \ five months. I learn to make \"chapati\" with Sunny,  eat fresh nettles in an\
  \ Autrian way. I learn to say NO to a boyfriend's proposition, I was self confidant\
  \ for once. The quiet Arkan helped me put things into perspective. He is a political\
  \ refugee. His family was send to the USA and hasn't seen them for ages. We spend\
  \ hours talking late on the evening about ours countries. He made believe that we\
  \ have the power of our happiness, even war can't destroy our destiny, each of us\
  \ are meant to be who we are. I choose Norway because I wanted breath-taking landscapes,\
  \ cross-country skiing sessions with locals... The last thing I was expecting was\
  \ to travel in five countries by staying in one place. I found five people, five\
  \ aspects of my personality that was hidden in me. Norway was the beginning of a\
  \ brand new me. I still cry thinking about that time, but I smile every hour because\
  \ I know that LIFE needs to be adventurous to be unforgettable."
