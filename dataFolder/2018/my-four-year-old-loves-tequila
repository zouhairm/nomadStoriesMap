Text: "The last thing I expected to hear was \u201CI love tequila\u201D coming from\
  \ my daughter. Sure, maybe when she\u2019s older but she was four when we took our\
  \ family vacation to Mexico. Kids are so pure at that age. Adorable, right? Not\
  \ necessarily when it\u2019s \u2018I love tequila\u2019 from your preschooler in\
  \ a pool full of people. You just hope and pray that everyone around doesn\u2019\
  t speak your language. \n\nMy daughter has never been the easiest traveler and I\
  \ mean that in the way that she gets car sick after long drives. It\u2019s just\
  \ too bad the vomit doesn\u2019t come at a pushy sales pitch. It\u2019s more likely\
  \ in the lobby of some grandiose hotel on white marble floors in front of a bunch\
  \ of beautiful people. \n\nTimeshare opportunities are rampant in Mexico and an\
  \ easy way to make some extra cash if you don\u2019t mind trading your valuable\
  \ time for a viewing. Not sure how we got roped into sitting through a presentation\
  \ but it\u2019s not worth it unless you\u2019re really interested in owning, and\
  \ in a position to do so. \n\nLet me tell you though; the easiest way to get out\
  \ of a timeshare push is to tell them that your astrologer won\u2019t let you sign\
  \ any contracts because mercury is retrograde. It was true; mercury was retrograde,\
  \ and when mercury is retrograde not everything is as it seems, so you\u2019re liable\
  \ to overlook details. I never realized it would elicit such a direct response and\
  \ quick exit. Feel free to use that one should you ever need it: Mercury retrogrades\
  \ three to four times a year.\n\nWhat imprinted Tequila on my daughter\u2019s subconscious\
  \ mind was not the fact that it was a staple throughout our stay in Mexico. We spent\
  \ a day blasting around in a dune buggy, up a mountain, through local villages and\
  \ rain forest; ultimately stopping at a beautiful lush oasis with natural pools\
  \ and a tequila shack. Everyone on the tour toasted many times to the agave plant.\
  \ \u2018Tequila\u2019 was shouted multiple times, loud and clear, especially from\
  \ one woman trying to drown her fear of spiders in the drink. It was mating season\
  \ and anyone with an arachnophobia would have cowered under the canopy of spiders.\
  \ Not my daughter; she took it upon herself to make sure the woman knew they were\
  \ Halloween decorations. \n\nTequila was the name she bestowed upon a bright pink\
  \ seal float whom she spent most of her time with in the pool. We picked him up\
  \ from the market after our dune buggy experience. Apparently my husband and I weren\u2019\
  t the only ones who developed a relationship with tequila while exploring the culture\
  \ and countryside."
