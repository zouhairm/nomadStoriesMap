Text: "I was 19 standing on the corner of an unfamiliar street mid-morning near the\
  \ fish market in Marseille. The sky was grey threatening rain, and the scent of\
  \ fresh soap, fish, and the Mediterranean mingled in a surprisingly comforting way.\
  \ It was one of those mornings when the air simultaneously chills and flushes the\
  \ cheeks making my face feel tight and new. \n\nI was waiting outside a soapery;\
  \ my friends shopping inside. I leaned against the burgundy exterior wall watching\
  \ old men haggle over the price of fish at the market set up on a dock in the port.\
  \ \n\nA short, dark man mosied around the corner and paused beside me. His face\
  \ broke into a wrinkled smile revealing a total of five teeth as he pointed at my\
  \ yellow scarf \u201Canglaise?\u201D in a non-French accent. My penchant for bright\
  \ colors always marked me as other here. In a moment of outsider-bonding, I responded\
  \ \u201Cam\xE9ricaine.\u201D He didn\u2019t seem to be in any rush, nor was I. Curious,\
  \ I asked where he was from to learn his home was once Algeria. \n\nHe had emigrated\
  \ to France as a young man about five decades previously before bringing his family\
  \ over a few years later. He mentioned it had been a struggle to find work, but\
  \ it was better than staying. It had been a difficult time for his family, but they\
  \ loved their new country. It was home.\n\nHis old eyes had lost focus as the past\
  \ carried him to a Marseille engulfed in a xenophobia he refused to name. His wrinkles\
  \ slackened the way men who have seen war have a tendency to do. It would be another\
  \ year before I learned of the French-Algerian war, and the continued persecution\
  \ North Africans and their descendants face living in France. \n\nHe quickly returned\
  \ to a genial old man, the way adults do to protect the young\u2019s innocent beliefs.\
  \ He barely knew me, yet he wanted to preserve the magical place I was taking in\
  \ for the first time. He did not want to be the one to destroy the facade my youth\
  \ and years of studying a language had allowed me to imagine. \n\nWith a nudge he\
  \ said, \u201CThe bread is hard to beat, though.\u201D I pulled a baguette out of\
  \ my purse in agreement. At least, we both knew the magic of a french baguette.\
  \ \n\nHe glanced at his watch before pulling a small bar of soap out of his pocket\
  \ handing it to me. Pointing at the shop sign behind us, \u201CMy wife will be mad\
  \ if I\u2019m late again!\u201D He passed my friends as they walked out mentioning\
  \ a sweet Algerian grandma. \n\nI lifted the soap to my nose. The smell of lavender\
  \ still reminds me of the Algerian I met in Provence."
