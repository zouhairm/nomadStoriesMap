Text: "There are things about the Congo I will never quite remember and there are\
  \ things about the Congo that I will never forget.\n\nEvery day at noon, Mama Sophie\
  \ invited me to her small apartment nestled above a bustling produce market to escape\
  \ the Congo\u2019s oppressive midday heat. The sultry scent of ripening mangos and\
  \ rotted street refuse rose through the bars on Mama Sophie\u2019s open windows.\
  \ \n \nA quick rap on the peeling door yielded a warm ushering in by her daughter,\
  \ Ama, \u201CCome in, come in! Mama\u2019s in the kitchen.\u201D \n\nMama Sophie\
  \ spoke little English but was fluent in French, Lingala, and Kikongo, Bantu languages\
  \ spoken widely in the DRC. My Spanish was only marginally helpful in deciphering\
  \ the overlap in romance languages, though my lifelong propensity for charades did\
  \ somewhat alleviate the language barrier. Where Mama Sophie and I failed for words,\
  \ we communicated through boiling pots and banana leaves, bonding over our shared\
  \ reverence for the kitchen as a sacred space. \n\nAs I entered the room, Mama Sophie\
  \ was hunched over a low stool vigorously peeling the unforgiving skins of a bundle\
  \ of unwieldy cassava roots, her sturdy arms working the gnarled tubers methodically\
  \ into submission with the fine edge of her sharpened knife. A small propane burner\
  \ gave life to a large pot ready to consume the exposed roots, the heavy vapor causing\
  \ perspiration to trickle noticeably down my brow. \n\nWhen she saw me, a wide smile\
  \ broke out over Mama Sophie\u2019s face, revealing a row of brilliant white teeth,\
  \ her dark, expressive eyes taking me on squarely. Dewy skin, the color of dark\
  \ caramel, highlighted the maroon scars that ran deeply across her cheek. They shone\
  \ as black rivers of pain and healing, ghosts of an embroiled colonized history\
  \ and a brutal civil war that had claimed over 5.4 million of Mama Sophie\u2019\
  s neighbors. A war that had nearly claimed her own life. \n\nYet, what truly remained\
  \ on Mama Sophie\u2019s face was the mark of a radiant spirit. The mark of a woman\
  \ that had nearly drowned in the murkiest of waters and surfaced to find her life\
  \ once again. With arms stretched wide and eager for my embrace, Mama Sophie's resonate\
  \ voice greeted me in Lingala, \u201CM\u2019bote mwana mwasi!\u201D (Hello daughter!)\n\
  \n \u201CHungry?\u201D she asked with lifted eyebrows.\n\n\u201CToujours!\u201D\
  \ (Always!) I replied with a smile.\n\nThere are things about the Congo I will never\
  \ quite remember and there are things about the Congo I will never quite forget.\
  \ Mama Sophie, I will never forget."
