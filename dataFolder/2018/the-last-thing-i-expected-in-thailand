Text: "I knew I was in trouble. \u201CBring the wine,\u201D my traveling companions\
  \ insisted. \u201CWe\u2019re on our way to meet the Prime Minister.\u201D\n\nI serve\
  \ on the Thai Arts & Cultural Center of Southern California. \u201CHow can you represent\
  \ Thais if you\u2019ve never been to Thailand?\u201D a Thai friend asked. Saowopa\
  \ invited to accompany her local Red Cross board to Thailand.\n\nI had always wanted\
  \ to travel overseas, but thought it was too expensive. She had put together a package\
  \ that was amazingly affordable. I was asked to pack some wine to give as possible\
  \ gifts.\n\nAs I was slipping two decent, moderately priced bottles into my suitcase,\
  \ my wife asked, \u201CWhat are you doing?\u201D\n\n\u201CPacking wine to give as\
  \ gifts.\u201D\n\n\u201CYou\u2019re not taking those!\u201D she insisted. \u201C\
  Take these.\u201D She shoved two bottles of Charles Shaw, Two-Buck Chuck, at me.\
  \ \n\n\u201CThey won\u2019t know the difference.\u201D\n\nWe spent the rest of the\
  \ day eating and shopping. There\u2019s a wide assortment of stalls on every major\
  \ thoroughfare where the food is fresh, safe and tasty. \nAt sunset, vendors set\
  \ up on the sidewalks and sell the latest fashion knockoffs. Dickering over prices\
  \ convinces both sides they got a deal. \n\nThe next day we visited Prime Minister\
  \ Thaksin Shinawatra at his residence. \n\nWe were surprised at the lack of security\
  \ as we were ushered into the room. I presented him with the wine and felt a collective\
  \ rolling of the eyes from my traveling companions. Maybe he didn't know it was\
  \ cheap wine, but they did.\n\nThaksin graciously received the gift and sat for\
  \ an informal conversation.\n\n\u201CDid you know I graduated from the University\
  \ of Texas?\u201D he offered.\n\nWe were surprised. Karen, the leader of our group,\
  \ wanted to know more. \u201CDo you still have a cowboy hat and cowboy boots?\u201D\
  \n\n\u201CNo, but I still chew tobacco and have a rifle rack in the back of my truck.\u201D\
  \ It felt like Thailand had welcomed us with open arms. \n\nA few days later, three\
  \ of us were ushered into a huge auditorium to celebrate Queen Sirikit\u2019s 75th\
  \ birthday. \n\nI spotted a room full of pastries on our way out. \u201CI\u2019\
  m hungry,\u201D I said. \u201CI\u2019m going to get some of those.\u201D \n\nWe\
  \ froze in our tracks when Prime Minister Thaksin breezed into the room. \n\n\u201C\
  So, how\u2019s the trip going, guys?\u201D\n\nThaksin, a charming rascal, was later\
  \ ousted as PM on corruption charges.\n\nI can\u2019t help thinking the wine had\
  \ something to do with it."
