Text: "India feels like big, warm, comfy overcoat; comfortable, familiar, the place\
  \ where my family lives. Growing up, I my parents and I took frequent trips to this\
  \ country, and it has always been a feast for the senses. The food, the bustling\
  \ streets, the sounds of merchant selling their wares, captivated my young mind.\
  \ I had never seen anything like it anywhere else. \n\nWhen I was older, I was warned\
  \ about the dangers of walking in the street alone. Being the stubborn teenager\
  \ I was I dismissed the comments and reassured my relatives that I would be careful.\
  \ To my horror, I found that men would leer at me in the street and would sometimes\
  \ make vulgar comments. For the first time, my rosy, sheltered view of this country\
  \ was shattered before my eyes. \n\nAfter the incident, I felt angry. I thought\
  \ it was unfair that my male cousins were free to go wherever they liked alone,\
  \ when I still had to be chaperoned in order to feel safe. This was when My Aunt\
  \ Introduced me to Karate Madam. \n\nKarate Madam's real name was Rajeshwari Chouhan.\
  \ She was a short, but strong woman in her 40\u2019s with short, cropped hair and\
  \ fiery hazel eyes. She drove a motorcycle, and liked to feed stray animals. As\
  \ she set a bowl of milk outside she began to tell me about her passion for Karate\
  \ and self-defense. \n\nWhen she was 14, she started her unusual hobby of learning\
  \ Karate.  Her teacher at the time was taken aback by a girl enrolling in such a\
  \ masculine activity, and initially tried to talk her out of it, but he was amused\
  \ by her tomboyish attitude and allowed her to attend. \n\nOver the next few years\
  \ Ms. Chouhan proved herself to be a talented and disciplined martial artist by\
  \ paving the path for other women. She was the first woman in the state of Andhra\
  \ Pradesh to earn her black belt and the first and only woman in India to hold a\
  \ 6th Dan Black Belt. All while dedicated herself to teaching and preparing her\
  \ students for competition. \n\nHowever, Karate Madam\u2019s greatest passion is\
  \ teaching women to defend themselves. India, in spite of its beauty, has seen increasing\
  \ rates of violence against women since 2008. When coupled with the societal expectation\
  \ of women being gentle and submissive, many women are left helpless. Chouhan hopes\
  \ that her classes will help empower women to protect themselves, and give them\
  \ a sense of security. \n\nI left her flat with a sense of peace and hope. I knew\
  \ felt I had the power to take life into my own hands."
