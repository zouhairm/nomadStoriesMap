Text: "As the day progressed, wild embers of red mingled with the clear blue sky resulting\
  \ in a melancholic purple color. The only sound that filled the air came from my\
  \ ride \u2013 the RE Machismo. It\u2019s vibrations and thump can easily be compared\
  \ to the beating of a human Heart. It had held me in good stead in the last 11 days\
  \ of riding to Khardung La \u2013 the world\u2019s highest motorable mountain pass\
  \ standing at 5359m above sea level. In retrospect, it felt as if it\u2019s vibrations\
  \ were elevating mine all along. Today was to be the last day of the ride with many\
  \ reasons to rejoice & since we were coming downhill our energy levels were higher;\
  \ yet the view around me drew my thoughts towards the world I was leaving behind,\
  \ the world I was going back to and the world that I wanted to create.\n\nWe had\
  \ a tour leader to navigate the group through the challenging terrain and weather\
  \ but since both of us seemed to have enough confidence in my ability to ride unsupervised,\
  \ I was ahead of the pack \u2013 a lead of about 15 minutes, enough to not lose\
  \ the group and yet enjoy reflecting in harmony with the consciousness of the magical\
  \ Himalayas.  Since I\u2019d lost my open face helmet 2 days ago, I had to wear\
  \ a full-face helmet today! My own helmet had fallen off the & rolled straight under\
  \ a truck\u2019s tire when visiting Gurudwara Patthar Sahib \u2013 a historic Sikh\
  \ temple managed by the Indian Army. \n\nComing downhill amongst other things meant\
  \ applying a lot of brakes & I could feel them losing their bite as the drums heated\
  \ up. Choosing to slow down, I cruised at a crawling pace waiting for my group to\
  \ catch up, also remembering that a notorious and treacherous Naala (a waterfall\
  \ that breaks and runs across the road) lay around the corner; when I heard the\
  \ familiar thump of another RE and saw Z, a 21 year old rider from Dubai grinning\
  \ from ear to ear. I tried flagging him down to warn of the dangers ahead but as\
  \ he overtook me, the look in his eyes showed excitement and jubilation. It was\
  \ clear that he was not slowing down. Revving my own bikes throttle loud enough\
  \ to catch the attention of even the dead and racing down a road comprised mostly\
  \ of loose stones \u2013 I managed to make him look back and stop in his tracks\
  \ just before he made the blind turn straight into the Naala. \n\nAt that moment\
  \ from the corner of my eye, I saw a boulder rolling down & coming at me. I could\
  \ either let it hit me and take me off the edge with little chance of survival,\
  \ or ram into it and hope to make it out alive."
