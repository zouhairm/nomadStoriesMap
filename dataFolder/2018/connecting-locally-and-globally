Text: "Mount Kenya National Park is basically a giant circle around an ancient volcano.\
  \  Somewhere in the distant past, molten rock ripped the summit apart into three\
  \ separate peaks.  The park, a mere 276 square miles of land, is home to over 50\
  \ endemic species of plant and animals that exist no where else in the world.  The\
  \ trailheads start in jungle ecosystems, but as you climb in elevation, you encounter\
  \ a world fit for a Dr. Seuss book.  The landscape was shaped by lava, wind, and\
  \ almost the only snowmelt in the entire country.  Once out of treeline, shrubs\
  \ and small plants dominate, the shapes and colors of which you have never seen.\
  \  There is no easily accessible guidebooks to tell their names and species.  If\
  \ you are lucky enough to have a topographical map, handle it like an ancient manuscript\
  \ because you may never see another for sale.  \n Kenyan guides lead people up this\
  \ mountain, not maps.  Porters carry their things, not backpacks.  Because of that,\
  \ there is an odd sight in the park each year.  It\u2019s a line of women, leading\
  \ and supporting themselves to the summit.  It is hard enough to find any local\
  \ Kenyans in the park, who come to climb the mountain for pleasure, but women! \
  \ I got to join them in 2017.  The trek was organized by the Biocultural Conservation\
  \ Institute, an NGO that now focuses mainly on Maasai women.  They sponsor girls\
  \ to attend school, coordinate a jewelry co-op, and bring 5-6 women from the U.S.\
  \ each year to increase the community of support of women worldwide.\n The dream\
  \ of climbing a mountain by themselves was unfathomable to most of these women,\
  \ but I was continually amazed at their strength and willingness to carry on through\
  \ new and harsh circumstances.  The Maasai song of celebration at the summit still\
  \ rings in my ears, solidifying the point that this climb was about more than the\
  \ mountain.  \n We all take something away from a trip like this.  It might be newfound\
  \ motivation for an uncompleted goal, an epiphany about your life or the way you\
  \ live it, or simply expanding your capacity for compassion.  For me, it was about\
  \ seeing our similarities far above our differences.  People from all different\
  \ cultures can be admirable, supportive, and kind, but the next minute they can\
  \ also be harsh, judgmental, and dogmatic.  Traveling to another location on the\
  \ globe doesn\u2019t change that.  Enduring hardships doesn\u2019t make you better,\
  \ it just gives you a better perspective."
