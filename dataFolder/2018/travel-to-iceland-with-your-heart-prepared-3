Text: "I\u2019ll tell you a real history that happens with and me, my boyfriend and\
  \ a friend in our trip to Iceland in 2015! We decided to travel around the whole\
  \ country, sleeping in the car (yes, all of us together), discovering every corner\
  \ of this amazing land. As expected, the purpose of this adventure was to see the\
  \ Northern lights, and I don\u2019t think any of us were prepared for everything\
  \ we were going to see there... The lights was just one of thousands of beautiful\
  \ things that Iceland has.\nSo, let\u2019s go to the story! On the 4th day of the\
  \ trip, we decided to go to a beach with black sand and different rock formations\
  \ in and out of the sea, to have a breakfast with a special view. As soon as we\
  \ arrived, we found quite a bit number of people there, because we met very few\
  \ people outside the cities, but okay, could be a more touristy place than the others!\
  \ But then we ate, talked, took many pictures and at the time we leave... Guess\
  \ what! We started drive and the car became stuck in the dark sand!\nWe ask for\
  \ everyone in the beach and nobody have a rope, so we went to look for some house\
  \ to ask for help, when suddenly the sky turn black, the birds began to sing very\
  \ loud and fly all to the same way... I swear that I thought it was a volcano could\
  \ erupt, and we were in the middle of a deserted street with no car or food! God!\n\
  Finally we found a house, we could explain the situation and the very solicitous\
  \ Icelander said that will meet us on the beach in a few minutes. We go back to\
  \ the beach when we discovered the reason for the darkness: there was a total solar\
  \ eclipse, and we had no idea of that! That lot of the people were photographers\
  \ and there was the best place to see the phenomenon in the country!\nThe icelander\
  \ arrives after the eclipse, help us and quite gently explained there was a street\
  \ sign (with a strange symbol) that means it could not get in there by car. The\
  \ man left and my boyfriend was driving the car to get out of there when... Guess\
  \ what! He drove the car in the sand! Yes! Again! None of us had the courage to\
  \ go back to the house of the man who helped us, so we were making signs for cars\
  \ passing on the road, until someone stopped and helped us again!\nIt was a odd\
  \ moment, but certainly an amazing coincidence of fate so that we could see this\
  \ natural spectacle. If we had left after the breakfast, we could see just the black\
  \ sky and would not understand anything. Thanks Iceland, for more this gift, it\
  \ was of the most incredible journeys our lives!"
