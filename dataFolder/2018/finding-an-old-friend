Text: "I\u2019d only ducked into the alley to escape the chaos of Khao San Road. \n\
  \nEven back in 2003, walking down that street was an overwhelming experience, particularly\
  \ for a boy of 18, fresh off the plane and travelling solo.\n\nThai women sat outside\
  \ massage parlours calling out in accented English. TukTuk drivers waved laminated\
  \ cards illustrating the illicit places to which they could take me. Ladies that\
  \ had once been boys smiled and groped at passing men. Music thumped out of the\
  \ bars on either side of me and changed with every few paces, providing an endless,\
  \ disjointed soundtrack that was as incoherent and eclectic as Khao San Road itself.\
  \ In an attempt to regroup and decide my next move, I ducked into the alley.\n\n\
  That\u2019s when I saw the elephant.\n\nTo say this was the last thing I expected\
  \ to see there is an understatement. I hoped to see elephants later in my trip,\
  \ but the idea it would happen here had never occurred to me.\n\nShe was just a\
  \ baby so we stood almost face-to-face. Her head was still as her swishing trunk\
  \ searched me, looking for food. I wished I had something to give her. I saw there\
  \ was a cut halfway up her trunk. The vestiges of her last sip of water bubbled\
  \ out of it and seeped toward the floor like a tear.\n\nHer owner appeared and began\
  \ to lead her away. As she walked by I looked into her eye. I saw more sadness there\
  \ than I ever thought I'd see in another being. Sadness and something else. Fear.\
  \ She was terrified. And then I saw it. Her owner had a wooden stick which had,\
  \ protruding from one end, a large rusted hook.\n\nThen she was gone. Engulfed by\
  \ the hoards of people among whom she\u2019d be paraded all night. I went back to\
  \ my hotel \u2013 I'd start my adventure tomorrow.\n\n15 years later and I\u2019\
  m back in Thailand. This time, winding through the jungle to an elephant sanctuary\
  \ just north of Chiang Mai. Trees rush past the bus window, occasionally parting\
  \ to give a glimpse of the treetops in the valley below.\n\nWhen we arrive, we're\
  \ met by 3 elephants. We walk with them through the forest to their paddock, where\
  \ there's a 4th elephant. She's only recently been rescued (from Bangkok they say)\
  \ and is not ready to join the others. I begin to approach her but stop as something\
  \ jolts in my stomach. There\u2019s a cut, about halfway up her trunk, with water\
  \ gurgling out of it.\n\nIt can\u2019t be, can it?\n\nI step forward and touch her\
  \ head, feeling her spiked hair and thick dusty skin. I have food to give her this\
  \ time. And she no longer has any sadness in her eyes."
