Text: "Before I begin, children, don't try this at home!\n\nIt was the summer after\
  \ my sophomore year of college, and I was excited to embark on my first 'real' adventure\
  \ abroad. By real, I mean not with a travel tour company. I don't mean to put down\
  \ any touring companies, there are just things I wouldn't have experienced if I\
  \ was on a set schedule.\n\nI was traveling with my childhood best friend, and the\
  \ two of us decided to stay in an Airbnb in San Juan. Certain sites we planned to\
  \ see, but honestly, we were ready to just ride the waves. One thing we hadn't planned\
  \ was transportation. We were staying only an Uber ride from the airport, but other\
  \ places such as the rainforest, El Yunque, were at least two hours away. So, as\
  \ we tanned on the beach, we got creative. How do you meet people your age without\
  \ actually meeting them? The solution was Tinder. Yes, our generations \"hooking\"\
  \ up app can surprisingly be used for more than hooking up!\n\nMy friend and I got\
  \ right to swiping making sure it was clear we were just looking for recommendations\
  \ or new friends to show us around. It was incredible! In a short amount of time\
  \ we had been informed of certain foods to try, invited to nightlife events, and\
  \ people had even offered to show us around Puerto Rico. We had figured out how\
  \ to get to El Yunque!\n\nA few days later, we met up with some locals and took\
  \ the drive to the rainforest. It was amazing to hear the similarities we shared\
  \ while coming from such different backgrounds. The driver of our minivan even attended\
  \ college in Virginia like me!\n\nWhen we got to El Yunque, we headed to swim in\
  \ the waterfalls. As we got to the base of the first waterfall one of our new friends\
  \ started to look around. Seeing our puzzled faces, he explained that there was\
  \ a spot from which he used to jump! His friend looked at him like he was crazy\
  \ because there was no stated \"jumping zone\". In a split second, the boy jumped\
  \ off a random cliff and headed 30 feet down to the bottom. We looked over the waterfall\
  \ and saw him motioning for us to jump too. My friend did her best to deter me,\
  \ but I wanted to jump so bad! Looking down, I thought my nerves got the best of\
  \ me until all of a sudden I leaped. It was the most riveting experience; my adrenaline\
  \ was pumping, and I couldn't stop smiling. \n\nEven with others trying to turn\
  \ me away, I made the decision to jump and to this day it is still the best decision\
  \ I ever made. Looking over the edge, I pushed my fears away, and I experienced\
  \ Puerto Rico!"
