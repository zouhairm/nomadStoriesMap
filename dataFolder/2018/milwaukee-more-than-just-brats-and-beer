Text: "I was cold. I was tired. I was in Milwaukee. For anyone who thinks business\
  \ travel is glamorous, it isn't. I had no expectations and assumed it would be more\
  \ of the same, yet another stop on a grueling itinerary. To be honest, the trip\
  \ didn't start off well. I had forgotten to book my video guy's room and didn't\
  \ realize it until we were checking in. The freezing temperatures outside had no\
  \ bearing on the warmth and good humor at the front desk. They found him something\
  \ easily and with that minor hiccup sorted we went to dinner - a place called the\
  \ Old German Beer Hall. It was close to our hotel and looked unassuming from the\
  \ outside. We were meeting a client for the first time so I wanted something low-key\
  \ yet particular to Milwaukee. It was definitely not low-key. As the name suggests,\
  \ it was like walking into an old German beer hall.  We were enveloped by the other\
  \ patrons and included in shotskis and some sort of hammer game. Not what you would\
  \ expect on a Tuesday night. The food was hearty - brats and beer - and the service\
  \ was friendly. We could have continued but we called it quits early since it was\
  \ a school night. The next day, after work, we explored. Milwaukee has a down to\
  \ earth and quirky vibe plus lots of coffee shops and restaurants. Of course, we\
  \ checked out the statue of The Fonz which in no way does Henry Winkler justice.\
  \ I hope Henry wasn't offended when it was unveiled. That night, with classic mid-western\
  \ hospitality, another client invited us out. It started with burgers at AJ Bomber's,\
  \ a hamburger joint with tons of fried goodness, chaotic d\xE9cor and peanut shells\
  \ on the floor and then it turned into what felt like a wild goose chase. Patrick\
  \ wouldn't tell us where we were going which was fitting when we drove up to Escape\
  \ MKE - an escape room concept where you and a group of people are locked in a room,\
  \ given clues and expected to solve a puzzle within 60 minutes. After that, Bugsy's\
  \ Back Alley Speakeasy was the best way to end the night. This is a must-see and\
  \ must-do. No spoilers here so just go. On my flight the next day, I reflected on\
  \ my trip. I have traveled all over the world and stayed in amazing places. I did\
  \ not think Milwaukee would compare but it did. Two days earlier we flew into a\
  \ winter wasteland with arctic temperatures and had nothing planned except for a\
  \ video shoot in an unheated manufacturing warehouse. In return we were treated\
  \ to amazing hospitality, unexpected diversions and most of all, a trip we won't\
  \ forget."
