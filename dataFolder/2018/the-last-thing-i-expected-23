Text: "Stepping off the S-Bahn at Warschauerplatz Station, there was little to suggest\
  \ to me a hospitable stay for a novice to Berlin. I made a swift exit from the dark,\
  \ crowded station; it opened onto a wide bridge, one that spanned a wasteland of\
  \ tin-roofed shanties and rail yards. While I hadn\u2019t come expecting to revel\
  \ in much Old World splendor, my expectations for Berlin were dropping dizzyingly\
  \ quickly. \nFrom the moment I arrived at my hostel, though, I began to see the\
  \ tide turn. The bright, spacious lobby led through not only to an impressive spa\
  \ and bar, but to a dorm room that was paired me with an electric milieu of people.\
  \ Two sorority sisters from the Deep South, a food writer from Vancouver swaddled\
  \ in gray felt, and a stoner dude of unspecified Eastern European extraction. As\
  \ each of us came and went over the evening, and as the conversations that fired\
  \ up migrated from terrace bar to sauna, it became clear that the elements of the\
  \ elusive Hostel Experience were there \u2013 affability, youth, and a determination\
  \ to have a good time. \nI talked with the Southern girls about careers, friends,\
  \ university life versus conservatory life. We were interrupted by the Hungarian\
  \ young man, who arrived in a cloud of weed to tell us about a party he\u2019d heard\
  \ about down next to the tracks. The Canadian girl collected her floppy grey hat\
  \ from our room before we make our way, with no further debate. \nIn the stark grey\
  \ of the Berlin winter afternoon the tracks had been bleak, but as we descended\
  \ onto them under cover of night they were sinister. The yard stretched on, a checkerboard\
  \ of derelict shacks lit by the orange sodium glow of an occasional lamp. I was\
  \ halfway through letting my new Hungarian friend know that the rest of us would\
  \ expect him to confront any muggers for the group when we all heard the thud of\
  \ a bass line pounding.\nAround a corner we followed the sound to a building which,\
  \ like most of the neighborhood, looked like it could be taken down by a strong\
  \ wind. The grimy windows were covered, but voices and yellow light still escaped\
  \ through cracks. We pulled open the door, and for the second time in a single day\
  \ I failed to anticipate what I'd find. A well lit bar heaved with a fashionably\
  \ underdressed set of Millennials; on the opposite wall, a bartender in a woolly\
  \ hat purveyed a selection of craft beers. The girls and I were too happy not to\
  \ be having our organs harvested to feign any disappointment about the place not\
  \ being underground enough.\nenough."
