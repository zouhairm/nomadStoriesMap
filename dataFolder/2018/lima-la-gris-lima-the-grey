Text: "'You came here the wrong time.' I'm sitting on the beach when this sentence\
  \ comes to mind. It's a sentence locals have often said to me since my arrival and\
  \ in view of the everlasting grey sky and the perpetual drizzle I almost start to\
  \ believe this sentence was true. \n\nThe beach of Lima is stony. My right hand\
  \ picks up little pebbles only to drop them again. They feel cold. \"Do you think\
  \ I came here the wrong time?\" I turn my gaze away from the pebbles and towards\
  \ Luis who sits next to me. I can barely see the contours of his face because it's\
  \ already dusking. He smiles, turning his view towards the ocean. I can still make\
  \ out his dimples. \"I'm afraid, Lima's winter won't offer you any romantic sunsets,\"\
  \ he says mischievously. \"That's fine,\" I say. \"If only the constant grey was\
  \ broken by some light now and then.\" \n\nI have met Luis a few weeks earlier.\
  \ He is Peruvian, handsome, young and his story could have been taken right out\
  \ of a movie: He was 16 when he decided to leave his parents who wanted him to study\
  \ law, to do what he always wanted: dance. Now, years later, he has been to places\
  \ all over South America, financing his travels performing on streets and working\
  \ in bars. \n\nLuis stands up and holds out his hand to me. \"Come on, I'll walk\
  \ you home.\"\n\nThe streets of Lima are unusually silent and it's almost completely\
  \ dark now. Only the faint light of the street lamps lead our way. When we approach\
  \ the secluded and narrow street where I live, a man appears. He seems bulky as\
  \ he walks towards us and I notice the grim expression on his face. I squeeze Luis'\
  \ hand a little. \"Good evening,\" Luis says to the man in Spanish, kindly and with\
  \ calm voice. The man nods and it is only when he passes that I realize I had been\
  \ holding my breath. \"If you meet him again, he'll remember that I met him with\
  \ kindness,\" says Luis who has well noticed my brief anxiety. \"He won't harm you.\"\
  \ We've reached my place and I stand looking at him, amazed by his strong faith\
  \ in the good. A quality, I have already noticed so often about him. \"You did not\
  \ come here the wrong time,\" he continues. \"Light is omnipresent in Lima, you\
  \ just have to be open for it. Then the city will give it to you.\" He kisses me\
  \ softly. \"Sleep well.\"\n\nA few days later, on my way to school I look out the\
  \ bus window when I spot Luis in the distance, dancing on a crosswalk. People gather\
  \ around and some even get off their cars to join him. I smile. In this moment I\
  \ realize what he meant the other night."
