Text: "Our guide Xavier was 30 feet ahead of us, up the trail. He was looking beyond\
  \ the edge of the overlook, down at the valley. He was standing tall, strong, and\
  \ serene. From the corner of my eye, I saw my wife\u2019s camera locking down on\
  \ him. He saw it too and knew what to do. He looked straight again and paused for\
  \ a few seconds; enough time for her to snap a few photos. \n\nWe met Xavier that\
  \ same morning, standing in the middle of a paved road outside the sanctuary\u2019\
  s entrance. He flagged us down as we drove past him and a 12-year old boy. I thought\
  \ they were the people we read about: those who pull a rope across the road and\
  \ keep it up until you give them money (a sort of makeshift toll booth). I sped\
  \ up when I first saw them but, at my partner\u2019s command, slammed on the breaks.\
  \ He came to the window and introduced himself: he was a tour guide \u2014 I felt\
  \ ignorant and my partner embarrassed.\n\nAlthough we had traveled 16 months around\
  \ the globe just three years prior, my rusty traveler\u2019s instinct had put me\
  \ on alert. What an idiot, I thought. Xavier, a gentleman about 5\u2019 9\u201D\
  \ (1m75), endowed with a smooth caramel skin, spoke softly and made his sales pitch.\
  \ He told us to follow his car on the dirt path leading up to entrance.\n\nThe trail\
  \ began at the bottom of a small valley, where small grass-covered hills prepared\
  \ us for the hour-hike to the sanctuary. I saw my partner and him walking side-by-side\
  \ \u2014 the teacher and the pupil. This view brought me back three years, to the\
  \ dozen of conversations we had with guides, drivers, and passerby\u2019s in Mexico.\
  \ \n\nAfter an hour of complete isolation from the outside world, we caught up with\
  \ other guides. The trail opened onto a small clearing and took a sharp right turn.\
  \ Xavier lowered his voice. Slowly and gently, he pointed at the road ahead of us,\
  \ divided in half by tall milkweeds. On either side, we could see the first Monarch\
  \ butterflies quietly feeding off them. We proceeded gently, feeling like two elephants\
  \ in a glass shop.\n\nWhat we understood three years ago and that we were reminded\
  \ of that day hiking high up in the mountains of Central Mexico, is that connecting\
  \ to locals in earnest leads to connecting to their communities, their history and\
  \ traditions, and their natural environment. If it were not for Xavier\u2019s unwavering\
  \ desire to teach us and for our wanting to explore and learn, all of the treasures\
  \ of Sierra Chincua wouldn\u2019t have been more than a few distant memories recorded\
  \ on photographs."
