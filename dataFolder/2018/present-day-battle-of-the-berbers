Text: "\u201CThe government is suppressing our language and culture\u201D, said Zaid,\
  \ clearly perturbed.\n\nNobody had expected that, on a merry night under the star-studded\
  \ sky in the Sahara.\n\nAfter sand boarding in the backdrop of a sunset, we quickly\
  \ huddled in the tent. We sipped endless glasses of fresh mint tea over conversation.\
  \ The joyous mood continued as we had sumptuous meals of chicken and couscous. The\
  \ night was young as we all gathered around the campfire. Tall sand dunes safely\
  \ nestled us against the strong winds blowing on this cold December night. Flames\
  \ of yellow and red illuminated the orange dunes creating the perfect setting for\
  \ a musical performance from the Berbers.\n\nIt started with the clanging of the\
  \ metallic krakeb and beats from the tbilat, which reverberated in the desert. The\
  \ Berbers sang in a trance singing soulful folklore music at a high pitch. Their\
  \ face glowed in shades of yellow and red from the flames of the bonfire. It felt\
  \ like we were in a concert. We were so enthralled that we clapped with the rhythms.\n\
  \nAs the music died down, we were now curious to know all about the Berbers. Zaid\
  \ came forward to give an insight into their nomadic lifestyle. We huddled closer\
  \ around the fire and listened wide eyed.\n\nHe explained how they live life on\
  \ the go. Resting at places either in the plains or on the mountains where the cattle\
  \ could graze, the strong community bonding they have and evenings spent singing\
  \ around the bonfire.\n\nAs the conversation evolved, the topic slowly drifted towards\
  \ the political scene in Morocco. He expressed with deep regret how the government\
  \ is cracking down on the usage of their already endangered Berber language. They\
  \ strongly feared losing their only link to the past.\n\nThe mood in the desert\
  \ was changing too. From the sound of the krakebs ringing in your ears to hearing\
  \ Zaid\u2019s pitiful story, the night turned colder. \n\nHis voice deep, he continued\
  \ that the print and electronic media too are barred from using Berber which further\
  \ alienated them from the thriving Arab culture in Morocco.\n\nZaid and his people\
  \ were using music as a way to propagate their history and a means to keep their\
  \ culture alive. He enraptured us with his narration and fluency in English having\
  \ never been to school! \n\nHe stole the show that night. What was supposed to be\
  \ a fun desert camping with hearty meals and lively music under the starry sky turned\
  \ out to be a heart to heart conversation where we could only sympathize with the\
  \ Berbers."
