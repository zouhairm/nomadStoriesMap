Text: "Her wide smile extinguished my nerves as soon as she opened the door. She stood\
  \ there, wet hair wrapped in a towel, wonderfully at ease despite two strangers\
  \ at her door at 10pm.\n  We had already showered, slept in and become familiar\
  \ with their apartment. We had noticed the Chinese characters on the shampoo bottles,\
  \ and puzzled over the reward system on a hand written calendar taped to the fridge.\n\
  \   They were at work that the morning when we had arrived and let ourselves into\
  \ the derelict building. The taxi driver had dropped us in the middle of the street\
  \ with heavy backpacks and no directions. In front of us was a dodgy looking security\
  \ gate and a guard who smiled brightly but didn\u2019t speak any English. Apart\
  \ from us, nobody did.\n  It was sticky and humid. The footpaths were broken and\
  \ dusty. There were people everywhere, but not another tourist in sight. It was\
  \ scary, daunting, disorientating. And brilliant.\n  In the lift the lights flickered.\
  \ The hallway was dark and electrical cords dangled precariously. The code to their\
  \ door, which she had sent in an email the day before, produced the desired green\
  \ light. Relief.\n  They had been at work all day, entrusting us with their home\
  \ for the 12 long hours they would be away. Returning from our $1 beers and $4 hot\
  \ pot in the steamy street below, the code didn\u2019t seem appropriate this time,\
  \ so we knocked and waited nervously.\n  She let us in and we took our places on\
  \ the bright red L-shaped couch, which was also our bed for the night. It was the\
  \ only coloured object in the room. Its complexion was intense and its attitude\
  \ fierce.\n  He emerged, also from the shower, gentle and shy; he put on some tea.\
  \ She spoke in stilted English, always with a smile. They had decided to make Beijing\
  \ their home four months ago. According to the calendar it was exactly 112 days.\
  \ To get here, they had spent two years hitchhiking. We had taken a 12-hour flight.\
  \ We were different, but alike.\n  We were worried that we did not speak any Mandarin.\
  \ They were worried that they did not speak enough English. We were counting the\
  \ days since we had left work. They were counting the days since they had begun.\n\
  \  For a moment in time we sat together on a red couch and drank Chinese tea with\
  \ coconut milk powder in it.\n  They were a couple of Ukrainian\u2019s living in\
  \ Beijing, teaching English. We were an Australian girl and an Irishman on our way\
  \ to live and work in Canada, via Beijing for 51 hours. A red couch had brought\
  \ us together."
