Text: "New Zealand. Land of the long white cloud. And the longest walks it would seem.\
  \ There are nine. I have now done one of those nine. I was not however on cloud\
  \ nine. But more on that later!\n\nThe Heaphy Track beckons many a hiker, or as\
  \ we in Aoeteroa call it, a tramper. It lays between Karamea on the West Coast of\
  \ the South Island, and Collingwood, the top of the south; also known as Golden\
  \ Bay. \n\nIt is quite apparent that once you get to the start of the track, you\
  \ are on your own. There is no mobile phone coverage, which is some of its appeal!\
  \ It's just you and the bush. \n\nNot one to beat around the bush, we were on track.\
  \ I was expecting day one to be a hard day as the backpacks would be the heaviest\
  \ with all our week's provisions and supply of food. Little did I know, as the week\
  \ drew on, I would become weaker and even carrying my own feet would be a task.\n\
  \nBut I digress. The Heaphy Track is abundant with flora, fauna and the sheer beauty\
  \ of the landscape consumes your senses. A bit of rough terrain at times, but what\
  \ an elated feeling to finally arrive at your hut for the night. The huts consistently\
  \ consisted of several bunks and cooking facility. And the obligatory long drop\
  \ loo out the back. \n\nMy worst night was at the Mackay Hut. I had developed a\
  \ wisdom tooth ache and of course there are no shops to fix that at tooth hurty\
  \ in the morning. Blisters toothache and exhaustion aside I cannot recommend this\
  \ walk highly enough. \n\nIt is truly magestic. The weather is great even when it's\
  \ not. There are song birds, Friendly Wekas foraging about in the bush, and you\
  \ may even see a Kiwi. It might be a human kiwi but a kiwi none the less. \n\nOn\
  \ occasion you may see, or even be, a mountain biker with a small group at certain\
  \ times of the year. The rangers from DOC (department of conservation) doing their\
  \ maintenance; but it's by chance you will see them. You are lucky to experience\
  \ all this grandeur and know that it's all yours for a moment. And the memories.\n\
  \nBut the best part is, it's a piece of New Zealand that to see it up close you\
  \ really know you earned it. You walked (if unfit like yours truly you may have\
  \ crawled) 82km to bask in the glorious gift from The Big Guy In the Sky. This is\
  \ why it's called Godzone. Because it is."
