Text: "As if it was a dream, last year came to teach me one of life\u2019s greatest\
  \ lessons. When it started, I thought I had it all: the job of my dreams, financial\
  \ stability and the perfect relationship. Little did I know that my soul was suffering\
  \ for self-expression. I had spent most of my life trying to please others, so it\
  \ just got fed up and threw me into a series of breakdowns on every level of existence.\
  \ Mobbing, psychosomatic illness, depression, heavy anxiety and posstraumatic disorder...\
  \ even my partner started blaming me for not coping well with my depression. Everywhere\
  \ I turned for support, I found more alienation. So insomnia, memory and focus loss\
  \ took over. \n\nThe summer in Europe was as crazy as my own life. On one side heavy\
  \ storms, on the other, forest fires and draught. The endless rain I embraced for\
  \ a while and cried my heart out. But I couldn\u2019t get rid of the manic anxiety\
  \ that held me back from being truly me. At the end of the summer there was no more\
  \ time, nor heat, and I couldn\u2019t imagine lasting another year without sun.\
  \ What scared me most was to go back to south Europe.  Only to get rid of my anxiety,\
  \ I had to throw myself in it. I jumped into the car, and after being almost robbed\
  \ near Prague, I got lost in the Alps at night. Then my cars breaks broke. Panic.\
  \ But I fixed them and took route to the Croatian coast. \n\nThe more the journey\
  \ continued, the more it pushed me to an edge. Pure madness, but intuitively I knew,\
  \ this is what I need to heal. After 3 days I got to the island of Krk, and enjoyed\
  \ the sun for little less than a day. The final challenges were coming with the\
  \ fast gathering clouds of the afternoon. During the night, a storm hit me, and\
  \ my car almost caught fire because of water in electrical parts. I lost it, shouting\
  \ at the sky to stop. I was exhausted. Two days later, the sun came out and then\
  \ the moon, shining on my fears. \n\nAt dawn I had to leave to finish up business\
  \ at home. One more time I went swimming in the clear waters, rejuvenating my body,\
  \ mind, spirit. Not knowing that the lessons were far from over. On the viaducts\
  \ of the croatian motorway, suddenly everthing got covered in rain. The cars in\
  \ front vanished. My car turned to a surfboard. I couldn\u2019t see the edge of\
  \ the road, as if driving through the ocean. Never have I felt so close to death.\
  \ My heart pounding, my body paralised, I drove slowly. I don\u2019t know for how\
  \ long. And all of a sudden all the anxiety and lack of self-trust were washed away\
  \ and gone..."
