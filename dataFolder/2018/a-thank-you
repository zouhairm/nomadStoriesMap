Text: "Before the sun rose we were trekking the last few kilometres. I was exhausted,\
  \ having foregone my altitude medication and spent the last three days climbing\
  \ and descending at heights above anything Australia could offer. For the most part\
  \ I had coped quite well and my Spanish was improving by the day, but the last night\
  \ on the trail I was starting to fade. The end was in sight however, and it was\
  \ a shorter day of walking so that we could explore the ancient ruins of Machu Picchu.\n\
  As with the majority of Inca Trail pilgrims, we had benefitted greatly from the\
  \ porters assigned to our tour. Mostly local farmers, they spend the tourist season\
  \ transporting all manner of goods along the trail on their backs. Until you see\
  \ them in action, it seems absolutely ludicrous that they could carry all the gear\
  \ for the 35 people in our group \u2013 including tents, kitchenware, food and even\
  \ an oven. After breakfast when the group has already marched out, they pack up.\
  \ And they run. \nUp and down valleys along the slick mist-soaked stone trail, their\
  \ feet hammering along supported by all manner of shoe variations. A call comes\
  \ out from hikers behind you to make way and you step aside. They careen past you\
  \ at speed, lithe and sure-footed with a confidence that tells you they\u2019ve\
  \ done this a hundred times or more. In one of those bulbous packs jostling along\
  \ on a porter\u2019s back is your sleeping bag and tent, your toothbrush and pajamas,\
  \ your spare socks. All you deign to carry is a daypack with rainwear, maybe an\
  \ extra layer or a beanie, your camera and your water.\nAfter a long morning\u2019\
  s trek you come upon your lunchtime camp. The communal dining tent has been assembled,\
  \ food is nearly ready and everything is set up for you to rest. Years later I am\
  \ still incredulous at this feat of teamwork and human endurance. How could I possibly\
  \ feel anything but embarrassment at my privilege \u2013 to travel yes, but more\
  \ importantly to have others carry for me?\nThis scenario repeats itself twice a\
  \ day on the trail. Without porters it would be a gruelling and perhaps unachievable\
  \ dream, the kind that comes up when reminiscing with friends about the things you\
  \ might have done. The kind that becomes a regret. I expected the journey to visit\
  \ my favourite ancient site would be full of wonder and awe. I expected an unashamed\
  \ emotion when seeing Machu Picchu for the first time. I didn\u2019t expect to be\
  \ brought to tears when asked to be our group\u2019s spokesperson and thank the\
  \ porters for all they\u2019d done for us."
