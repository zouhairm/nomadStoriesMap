Text: "It's five minutes into the taxi ride from Aswan airport, and I'm thinking my\
  \ gluteal muscles are going to be in great shape by the end of this trip. As were\
  \ barreling down the dark road in this shallow grave Mitsubishi , the warm, dry,\
  \ somewhat dusty air hits my face with an accompanying smell, not good not bad just\
  \ that perfect unfamiliar odor that confirms your in a foreign land.\n\nMy destination\
  \ for tonight is the Old Cataract Hotel in Aswan, Egypt. I walk into the lobby of\
  \ the this beautiful old grand hotel which was a favorite of Winston Churchill,\
  \ and a scene of inspiration for Agatha Christie as she penned Death on the Nile,\
  \ and think how can a I afford a place like this. The answer would come tomorrow\
  \ when I meet my guide \"Monsoor\" the following day.\n\nIt's 9:00am, Monsoor and\
  \ his driver are already waiting for me outside, \" Hello Mr. Joe\" says Monsoor,\
  \ who looks to be in his mid-thirties, clean cut, nothing exceptional about his\
  \ appearance, just a regular guy you might see back home. We are headed to the Temple\
  \ of Philae, which is perched atop an island in the Nile, when the conversation\
  \ turns to tourists or the obvious absence of tourists. Monsoor reveals that I am\
  \ his first assignment in the last three weeks.\n\nAs many of you may recall, there\
  \ was an uprising in Cairo in 2011. It was during the Arab Spring, and there was\
  \ a revolt against the government and it's security forces. International networks\
  \ flooded the news with images of Cairo on fire, rioter's rioting, and assaults\
  \ taking place. Sadly, for other regions in Egypt, they were guilty by association.\
  \ When the smoldering subsided and things were restored. the damage was done in\
  \ the form of plummeting tourism in all of Egypt. \n\nMonsoor, a trained Egyptologist\
  \ said, \"Making a living has been hard for the last five years\". It has even affected\
  \ his ability to attract a partner, \" A woman does not want to marry a man who\
  \ can't provide a living\" he says with a heaviness that makes me think this thought\
  \ occupies his mind quite frequently. Empty hotels, docked cruise ships and market\
  \ vendors with no one to sell to are a common scene. \n\nI'm back at the Old Cataract\
  \ after exchanging contacts with Monsoor enjoying an evening drink. It's a warm\
  \ breezy night on the hotel terrace that overlooks a very narrow part of the Nile.\
  \ The palms rustle as they gently sway, a felucca sails by in silence and I think\
  \ how peaceful, it's a shame few others are experiencing this beauty."
