Text: "When visitng new countries, I don\xB4t see myself as a tourist but as a traveller.\
  \ A traveller travels to  discover the unknown, to learn and embrace the newness\
  \ that is presented from the minute he leaves his comfort zone. As I travel across\
  \ cities, countries, and continents I avoid the main tourist attractions, for sure\
  \ I go and see them with enthusiasm, but in no rush as I endulge the new found traditions,\
  \ cultures, food, languages and people that surround me. \n\nSpending time with\
  \ the locals is my motto. What would be the point of moving to new grounds if not\
  \ with the locals themselves? As you travel, you need to rid yourself from expectations\
  \ as what awaits are experiences that will assist you in your growth of self deiscovery;\
  \ who am I?where do I belong? in this vast world of differences yet similarities.\
  \ As you travel you realize that although we hold different views, beliefs and traditions\
  \ we all feel and experience the same emotions and thoughts, we are one amid our\
  \ unique traits. And that is what it\xB4s about, being open to discover the many\
  \ realities that exist beyound ones imagination and the richness that lays in trusting\
  \ the unknown as we let our feet guide us through the oceans and lands that spread\
  \ vastly across the globe bigger than one can imagine.  \n\nSo allow me to introduce\
  \ you to the beauty that this world has to offer through my experiences which could\
  \ inspire you to take that step which may have been something you always wanted\
  \ to do but never found the courage to do so. Once you start you will realize that\
  \ the roads are endless and the stories are boundless..."
