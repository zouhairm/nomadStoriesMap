Text: "I have always been an extremely bubbly and chirpy girl who\u2019s always looking\
  \ for magic. In fact, never stopped believing in magic. I believe, if you have the\
  \ power to dream, you sure will have the strength to make them come true and with\
  \ this perfect combination of dream and strength, magic is bound to happen.  \n\n\
  My dream wasn\u2019t a big, seemingly unachievable one. I just wanted to go and\
  \ watch my favorite band play live, once. To my surprise, Coldplay decided to perform\
  \ in India, but not to my surprise, my parents refused for me to go. That\u2019\
  s when magic came to play and I managed to buy tickets to the concert in Singapore.\
  \ My cousin brother, who had been staying there came to my rescue. \n\nThe traveller\
  \ inside of me jumped and looked up everything about Singapore. Almost a year of\
  \ meticulous planning, saving money, research and overthinking gave me goose bumps.\
  \ I couldn\u2019t control my excitement. I covered most of the touristy part of\
  \ Singapore in the first 4 days. That country is smaller than the city I live in,\
  \ it wasn\u2019t that difficult a job anyway. On the night of the fourth day, I\
  \ sat with my brother enjoying a glass of beer and his usual elder brother talk.\
  \ I had one more day to go before the concert, he asked me to visit the Tree Top\
  \ Walk of MacRitchie Reservoir. My overly adventurous self, conveniently neglected\
  \ the intensity of the trek and the size of that nature reserve.\n\nThe next morning,\
  \ I trickled out of the bed, my legs hurt from the incessant walking that I wasn\u2019\
  t used to. I made myself breakfast and decided against taking a bath because I was\
  \ going to sweat, or so I expected. I grabbed my undercharged phone, assuming to\
  \ be back in three hours along with my earphones and a small map and left for the\
  \ nature reserve. I was used to navigating my way through Google maps. As soon as\
  \ I began the trek, it started drizzling. I continued walking and the drizzle soon\
  \ became a shower. It took two hours for me to reach the tree top and I was soaking\
  \ wet. As I walked on the bridge, a few feet above this huge expanse of rain forest,\
  \ I was all alone but I could breathe. \n\nI had to go through the walks they had\
  \ created inside the forest. It took two and a half hours for me to get back, my\
  \ phone was dead, I was tired, drenched, didn't have food or water. But, I managed.\
  \ That day, I learnt about the bliss this nature is capable of giving. Even though\
  \ my journey was tiring, I could dance in the rain and feel the fresh air. I fell\
  \ in love with myself."
