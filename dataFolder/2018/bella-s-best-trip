Text: "India is often addressed as the heaven for tourists. People from all over the\
  \ world are attracted here and love to spend time while exploring the country, its\
  \ culture and its heritage. Bella, a 22-year-old traveller from London, thought\
  \ of celebrating the perfect traveller new year this time by spending it on a flight.\
  \ She was coming to India for the first time which was her dream ever since she\
  \ became a traveller. She was both excited and nervous at the same but was constantly\
  \ looking at her new travel diary to pen down her experiences of her expedition\
  \ to explore India within a month.\n\nThough she was tired during her journey, she\
  \ felt instantly full of energy as soon as the flight landed at New Delhi airport.\
  \ Indian vibes were enough to bring a smile on her face and she was happy that she\
  \ could finally come here. Her tour guide was waiting for her whom Bella met in\
  \ full energy. She did a handshake and a Namastey in the local style and the two\
  \ of them headed towards the hotel discussing their plans in the car. It was decided\
  \ that she would meet him after lunch & was too excited to visit the places that\
  \ she had only seen on Google.\n\nAs per her plan, she was supposed to visit Qutub\
  \ Minar, India Gate, Jama Masjid, Akshar Dham, Nizamuddin Dargah, Red Fort, Raj\
  \ Ghat, Jantar Mantar, Mughal Gardens and Rashtrapati Bhawan in 2 days and then\
  \ go to Agra. However, every place made her speechless and she spent 4 days in visiting\
  \ all of them. Her traveller friends had already warned her that once she would\
  \ be in India, nothing would go according to her plan. But she was happy about it.\
  \ On local recommendations, she even decided to visit Chandni Chowk and some of\
  \ the food joints that she would not have visited otherwise. She was mesmerized\
  \ by the food and did too much shopping. She bought enough suits to wear and from\
  \ the next day onwards, she was seen in bright coloured suits. \n\nThe stay in Delhi\
  \ that was supposed to last for 2 days went to 7 days. By the end of this stay,\
  \ Bella had become a local. She had ditched her English meals for Indian meals and\
  \ was enjoying Chhole Kulche & Kebabs. She had never tasted so many sweets in her\
  \ life and Jalebi and Gulabjamun became her favourites instantly. While she was\
  \ in awe seeing the historical and cultural places, the local markets and restaurants\
  \ always made her smile.\n\nThough she did not want to leave Delhi, Varanasi was\
  \ waiting for her. The only regret she had was why hadn\u2019t she visited India\
  \ earlier!"
