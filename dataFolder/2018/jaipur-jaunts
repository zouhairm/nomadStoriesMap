Text: "Epitome of art, architecture and culture. They are rightly the essence of\_\
  \ Jaipur, the pink city. Place so vibrant and colorful can be synonymized as \u201C\
  Gateway to Royal Rajasthan\u201D. Art and Architecture is so vastly reflected in\
  \ the city that once visited, it\u2019s almost impossible to control the urge to\
  \ visit other parts of the state.\nFood and delicacies of this region are something\
  \ not to ignore either. Rich in spices, flavours and desi Ghee are truly the royal\
  \ ingredients of a Rajasthani meal. This is the exact reason a clique of girls got\
  \ lost on the streets of Jaipur looking for that perfect Gewarh,Pyaz ke Samose and\
  \ Dal bati churma; until they could satisfy their appetites.\n\nOne of the girls\
  \ wanted to capture the moments and perceptions, while others wanted to be captured\
  \ in the moments.\nWhile the other girls wanted to take back goodies and merchandises\
  \ as memorabilia, this girl wanted to take back the memories, trapped in the right\
  \ words.Again, one among them, wanted to live in the aroma and vibes of the place\
  \ herself, while others wanted to just experience them temporarily.\nThere was something\
  \ beautiful about feeling on vacation and at home all at once, that\u2019s what\
  \ made her pen this down.\n\nFour girls landed in the city, early in the morning,\
  \ unaware of even the places to halt. But were no slow-paced in kick starting the\
  \ day, all dressed to perfection and making bold statements. \u201CYes, they believed\
  \ in travelling in class\u201D. It didn\u2019t matter how their itinerary was, but\
  \ their attires were sure as hell \u2018well planned\u2019. It included colors and\
  \ vibrancies as a base, two days of modernity with some desi touch, while one day\
  \ restricted to contemporarily basic ethnic outfits!!\nItinerary was something like\
  \ this, first day included all the outskirts, majorly forts of Jaipur. Second day\
  \ an excursion to Ajmer and Pushkar. Last day included the local inner-city sight-seeing.\
  \ Planned shopping was to be done either at Pushkar or on the last day of trip which\
  \ went for a toss and they ended up shopping on all three days!!\n\nGirls felt teleported\
  \ to the era of maharaja at the end of the trip, these structures gave them a feel\
  \ of life within them. How they wished, they could go back in time and visit when\
  \ these places were inhabited!!\n\nP.S. My HApPyy Moments:\nSpotting Colorfully\
  \ Painted Elephants on the streets.\nWatching ladies cooking roti on the lanes of\
  \ Pushkar.\nGetting a glimpse of civilization and mountains merging.\nBuying a palazzo\
  \ with elephant prints on them"
