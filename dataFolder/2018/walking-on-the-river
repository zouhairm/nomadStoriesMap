Text: "Some places take us back to our origin. The Parna\xEDba river, in the North\
  \ of Brazil, is one of them. Primordial and pure. Over there humans are just a mishap\
  \ between bronze waters and embroideries of mangroves.\nI was sailing it on a little\
  \ motorboat, driven by a red-face fisherman. Near the delta, Parna\xEDba slows down\
  \ its flow, so it's easy to see wild animals along the shore, such as alligators\
  \ and red ibis. After the first miles accompanied by the engine noise, the rest\
  \ of the trip remained silent, broken just by animal calls. No human sounds. \n\
  Parna\xEDba erases all the excess, words, time, norms, fears: I was with a stranger\
  \ in the middle of nowhere, sure that nothing bad could happen. \nBut I was wrong.\
  \ The boat suddenly stopped. A valley of mud stretched endlessly in front of us.\
  \ The fisherman said to me that we were arrived. Now I had to go down and walk straight.\n\
  The mud smelled like rotten fish and I couldn't understand how deep it was. I shook\
  \ my head, it was ok for me to stay on board. He repeated to me to go down and walk,\
  \ and I replied irritated: \u201CEscorregadio. I'm not able to walk in this\u201D\
  , pointing at the mud. \nHe made a sad expression. I wasn't trusting him. I wasn't\
  \ trusting myself. \nBut Parna\xEDba drags anything away, also mental limits. So\
  \ I changed my mind. I took off my platform shoes and I slowly descended in the\
  \ sludge. It was like a disgusting pudding, cold and knee-deep. Walking on, I could\
  \ feel little shells breaking beneath my naked feet. After few minutes I was giving\
  \ up: I felt tired and no longer sure that human curiosity should always be satisfied.\
  \ Looking back, however, the boat was already so far. Then I decided to build up\
  \ the courage and go on. I don't know how much time I walked across the pudding.\
  \ But I had to trust the red-face fisherman, something was waiting for me. Finally\
  \ it appeared, with a dazzling turquoise color: I raised up the eyes and the line\
  \ of the Ocean was in front of me. The lazy, predictable Parna\xEDba finished with\
  \ a breathtaking twist. \nThe sand took the place of the mud, allowing me to run\
  \ until the water, screaming all the words kept in my mind until that moment. I\
  \ was so happy, so grateful. \nBack to the boat, the fisherman looked at me with\
  \ a some kind of grin. Once on board, I noticed he was wearing my platform shoes,\
  \ trying awkwardly to walk. Taking one off with a disgusted face, he grumbled: \u201C\
  Escorregadio. I'm not able to walk in this\u201D, addressing me an intimate, knowing\
  \ smile."
