Text: "Not long ago, I came back from one of the best trips of my life: I hitchhiked\
  \ in the company of my mother through the green countries of Costa Rica and Panama,\
  \ not only to appreciate sights, but also local encounters with ordinary extraordinary\
  \ people. Our adventure started from the town of Tamarindo with a cook from Colombia\
  \ who drove us to Nicoya through the hilly fields of Costa Rican countryside. Horses\
  \ and cows lied peacefully on the broad expanses of grass, and small houses sprouted\
  \ among the vegetation. From Nicoya to Monteverde, we found a ride with a religion\
  \ teacher originally from a farming community of the Central Cordillera. He told\
  \ us about his trip overseas when he was a teenager, as a gift from Pope John Paul\
  \ II. He dropped us on the road that climbs, through small towns and sodden vegetation,\
  \ into the heart of the Monteverde reserve, where we spent a morning with two Swiss\
  \ surrounded by gigantic trees and wrapped in a thick layer of fog. Later, we stopped\
  \ at the bridge of River Tarcoles to see a herd of gigantic crocodiles parked on\
  \ the bench of the river and pushed ourselves inside the heart of the Carara National\
  \ Park, where an immense waterfall, set between two high rock walls, looked like\
  \ the giant sovereign in a bay of a wild forest. In a village on the Caribbean Coast,\
  \ I met an indigenous boy with a skin the color of coffee with milk, and long hair\
  \ made up in tiny dreadlocks. He could have been the chief of his tribe, had he\
  \ been born long ago. In this present world, he is a lifeguard, one of the many\
  \ hearts stolen by the ocean\u2019s endless beauty, and a true tico, swearing love\
  \ to his waves and dancing away the long nights of tropical summers. A journalist\
  \ from Guatemala drove us through the frontier into Panama to the harbor of Almirante,\
  \ where we took a launch to Bocas Del Toro. A suggestive place, decorated with plump\
  \ scarlet-macaws singing in an unknown language, a few villages of natives and flourishing\
  \ nature. We hitchhiked through high-altitude expanses of foggy forests, close to\
  \ the coffee plantations of Boquete and the lands of Volc\xE1n Bar\xFA, towards\
  \ Panama City, to meet an American professor. The man brought us to the fish market:\
  \ stalls were abound with fish of all types and sizes, where everyone seemed to\
  \ be pre-tasting dinner. Along the seafront, skyscrapers were towering with imposingness,\
  \ shining at night with many small lights against the dark sky, delimiting a corner\
  \ of modernity in a country that is rural and poor."
