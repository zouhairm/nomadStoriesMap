Text: "We were zooming past the sprawling city of Pune, dim yellow lights fading in\
  \ the backdrop of black barren branches, in stark contrast to the violet skies streaked\
  \ with silver puffs of clouds.\nThe city where I felt empowered, independent as\
  \ a working woman for 3 years, my last day here was now ending, with my one eye\
  \ glued to metal hinges of the door for signs of any movement. The heinous \u2018\
  Nirbhaya\u2019 crime still etched in many Indian minds, my heart pounded wildly,\
  \ sweat trickled down as I traveled alone in a bus with three men.\n\nI was Petrified,\
  \ although completely covered and void of makeup, for this maybe could save my life?\n\
  \nHer words drew me out of my thoughts \u201CRelax, now we are all here,\u201D the\
  \ travel agent had probably explained her my situation, as I saw two more women\
  \ enter through the doors.\n\n\u201CMa\u2019am, have a safe journey\u201D he said.\
  \ The agent had ensured of my safety.\n\nThe worried voice of my fianc\xE9 from\
  \ another time zone hadn\u2019t been relieved until then.\n\nAt every jolt, I was\
  \ aware of the journey to Goa whilst engrossed in the hikes amidst the mesmerizing\
  \ havens of Pune. Through the doors of ancient towering fortresses, rooted atop\
  \ the peaks for centuries echoing the Maratha empire. Gliding about the breathtaking\
  \ enormity of the place that yet reverberated the laments of battle spirits. 4600ft\
  \ above sea level, engulfed in crisscross of rainbows, freezing clouds and mist,\
  \ rolling hills for miles across the horizon.\n\nI could hear their chatter across\
  \ my berth assuring me female company for the passing night.\n\nReminiscing my first\
  \ \u2018school hike\u2019 back in Goa, perched above the cliffs overlooking the\
  \ majestic white cascade of water, gushing down moss slopes into the fathomless\
  \ emerald pool below forming little streams across the ancient \u2018Tambdi Surla\u2019\
  \ temple.\nUnaccompanied, sprinting steep slopes, the off-beaten path of prickly\
  \ bushes, palms brushing the tree barks alternatively left and right in a rhythm.\
  \ My soul was elated having lived a dream of eons until ending up lost at crossroads.\n\
  \nAlone amid wild animals and possibly male monsters?\n\nAfter an endless search\
  \ I regained the trail joined by a group of two guys and a girl nicknamed \u2018\
  spunk streak\u2019, who like me had initially embarked alone.\nAmazed at my solo\
  \ feat, greeting me with pats of victory, our eyes glistened in joy for being amongst\
  \ the first of 800 to return to basecamp.\n\nNot all men are savages, but neither\
  \ are all women safe.\nThe two cities differed, time too, but nature didn\u2019\
  t, neither the fear."
