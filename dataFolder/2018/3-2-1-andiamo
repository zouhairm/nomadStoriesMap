Text: "I moved to the north of Italy at the beginning of February 2017\nThe goal:\
  \ becoming a great snowboarder\nIn reality: I was too busy making some amazing friends\n\
  I\u2019m walking in Tesero, that smell of burning wood in the Chimneys is filling\
  \ my nose, the kind of smell that reminds me of camp nights in the Scouts and the\
  \ fireplace at my grandmothers house.\nI\u2019m looking around me, in this snowy\
  \ town that sits at the foot of the mountain, excited to think about the dozens\
  \ of years that these colourful houses has been standing proud. How many people\
  \ walked these stone sidewalks, children\u2019s first steps, Boys leaving their\
  \ houses to join wars.\nI\u2019m making my way to the doorstep, taking out the key\
  \ from the vase, open the door and putting the snowboard down.\nThe end of a very\
  \ long day, Finally, or so I thought, the minute I sit down and lift my legs up,\
  \ I hear a rushed knock on the door, I get up to open the door to find Kaya in her\
  \ snow clothing with Izy in the driveway waiting in her car. Kaya is looking at\
  \ me \u201Cwhy are you not dressed yet?\u201D I looked at myself \u201Coh my god!\
  \ I didn\u2019t realize I was naked!\u05F4 looking at her sarcastically, \u201C\
  very funny, get dressed to snowboard, we\u2019ll wait in the car\u201D she walked\
  \ towards the car, I didn\u2019t really know why I\u2019m getting ready but I didn\u2019\
  t argued, I got ready, dropped my board in Izys car and squeezed in as well \u201C\
  \ I still don\u2019t get it, why are we getting ready to board? The resort was closed\
  \ an hour ago, I know because I took the last bus back\u201D Kaya and Izy looked\
  \ at each other and smiled \u201Cyou\u2019ll see tiny\u201D.\nThe rest of the ride\
  \ we spent singing Ed Sheeran and Bruno Mars, outside of the car the light started\
  \ to fade but it was still possible to see the green and white beauty of the valley.\n\
  We got to the ski resort parallel to ours. It\u2019s already 8pm and it is dark\
  \ outside, we come out of the car with our boards and everyone was there, Kasha\
  \ and Asia and the boys, all holding a glass of wine in one hand and their boards\
  \ in the other. When suddenly they all start counting down \u201C10\u201D \u201C\
  9\u201D \u201C8\u201D \u201C7\u201D \u201C6\u201D \u201C5\u201D \u201C4\u201D I\
  \ had no idea what is going on \u201C3\u201D \u201C2\u201D \u201C1\u201D and then,\
  \ dozens of lights lit the slopes and the  chairlift started working. Everyone queued\
  \ to go up the hill and I stayed put, stunned, one of the guys turned to me \u201C\
  andiamo Keren, we only have 3 hours till they close this place for today\u201D"
