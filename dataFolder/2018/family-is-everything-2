Text: "\u201CWhat is your salary, if I may,\u201D I asked hesitantly to Lalit Galle,\
  \ the cinnamon peeler, from the Cinnamon Islands. I had very ambitiously rowed all\
  \ the way from mainland Sri Lanka to the Cinnamon Islands, situated in the middle\
  \ of the Madu River.\n\n\u201C142 USD per month,\u201D he said and continued shaving\
  \ away the cinnamon bark.\n\nLalit was the first local I met as I climbed the long\
  \ sinewy steps which boasted the entrance to the Cinnamon Islands. He was sitting\
  \ cross legged in a comfortable position on the floor of a thatched hut, which served\
  \ as his shop. On two sides of the hut, there were long benches for customers to\
  \ sit and wait, the other side had a rack of shelves with packages of different\
  \ varieties and weight of cinnamon, on the fourth side there was a sorry excuse\
  \ of a flimsy door and a long poster boasting the benefits of cinnamon.\n\n\u201C\
  Do you have kids, family?\u201D I asked.\n\n\u201CYes, my 9 year old daughter and\
  \ 2 year old son stay in Bentota with my wife,\u201D he said barely looking up from\
  \ his task of shaving the bark.\n\n\u201CAnd where is that? Is it far from here?\u201D\
  \ I persisted.\n\n\u201CIt is another island. I row there during the weekends and\
  \ by the time I get used to having my family around, I have to come back here in\
  \ a day,\u201D he had finally looked up from his cinnamon bark long enough to talk\
  \ to me. His voice carried a sadness which even the strong cinnamon odor couldn\u2019\
  t mask. I felt sorry that he was able to meet his family only for a day in a week.\
  \ He explained that his wife did some odd jobs around Bentota Island to make ends\
  \ meet while her parents and her in-laws took care of the kids during the day.\n\
  \nI went around the island, purchased cinnamon sticks, had a cup of cinnamon flavored\
  \ tea and chatted with Lalit some more about his job, his family, his weekdays in\
  \ the island. Finally it was time for me to leave.\n\n\u201CI dream to one day live\
  \ together as a family with my wife and children for the entire week. That is my\
  \ only goal in life,\u201D Lalit said. I swallowed a lump in my throat as I heard\
  \ this.\n\nI rowed away bidding goodbye to Lalit and the Cinnamon Islands, the oars\
  \ splashing the teal waters. The vibrant aroma of cinnamon became lighter and lighter,\
  \ as I said a little prayer for him and his family.\n\nWhat we take for granted,\
  \ is a life aspiration for other people. Later I gave a tight hug to my 12 year\
  \ old son, and whispered a \u2018thank-you\u2019 out to the universe for being able\
  \ to do it every night. The cinnamon seller from Sri Lanka taught me that family\
  \ was everything."
