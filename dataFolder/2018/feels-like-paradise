Text: "\u201CAloha! Soon you\u2019ll be in one of the most beautiful places on earth\u201C\
  \ \u2013 the purser on our flight from San Fran to the Hawai\u2019ian island of\
  \ O\u2019ahu praises the US-American island chain like a lost paradise. Some hours\
  \ later we\u2019ll know whether he has been exaggerating. We\u2019ll enjoy some\
  \ weeks of pure laid-back-style and island hopping. Our daily companions? Amazingly\
  \ relaxed locals, curious big sea turtles, rainbow-colored shaved ice looking like\
  \ poison, impressive whales \u2013 and surfers riding huge waves. Well, hang loose!\
  \ The quite un-touristy garden island of Kaua\u2019i is the northernmost and oldest\
  \ island in the Hawai\u2019ian archipelago. Kaua\u2019i welcomes us with its lush\
  \ green landscapes as far as one\u2019s eyes can see. On our first morning we\u2019\
  re starting early towards the northern shore. The Na Pali shore will be our today\u2019\
  s destination. Given the enormous amount of possible trips by air, by sea or by\
  \ land we decided on the so called Nualolo Trail. This is said to be one of the\
  \ most spectacular hiking trails in Koke\u2019e State Park. And for me, a real big\
  \ deal as I am afraid of heights. Will this hiking trip push me to the edge? In\
  \ about two hours and four miles (one way!) the Nualolo Trail leads from the park\u2019\
  s headquarters downwards to the coast. On solitary paths we\u2019re wandering through\
  \ shady broad-leaved forest first. Suddenly the thicket of huge plants around us\
  \ clears up and a magical, sunny glade full of flowers appears in front. Further\
  \ on our way, continuously downwards, on deep red brickearth and through thick shrubbery,\
  \ the path finally leads us on a sunny ridge. Oh no, a ridge! In the distance we\
  \ can already catch sight of the blue Pacific Ocean and today\u2019s hiking destination\
  \ \u2013 one tiny viewpoint just on top of the cliffs, far above the sea. I am really\
  \ afraid if I can make it. Okay, better pushing aside the thought of doing one false\
  \ step in view of hundreds of meters of abyss just to the right and left of our\
  \ feet! But surprise surprise - it's only some comfy steps up and down, then, finally:\
  \ on an exposed, but thank God dust-dry path we\u2019re soon reaching the longed\
  \ for end of the trail: Lola Vista Point. I made it and I am fine. YES! For a long\
  \ time we\u2019re gazing into the huge Nualolo Valley to our feet, one of numerous\
  \ valleys at this part of the coast. Amazing silence and solitude. Is there any\
  \ picnic place more beautiful and impressive on earth? No, not at all. Mahalo \u2013\
  \ our purser has been damn right!"
