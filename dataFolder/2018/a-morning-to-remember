Text: "The echo of iPhone alarm tones playing in unison roused me awake, and I was\
  \ suddenly made aware of the freezing temperatures outside. Silencing my alarm and\
  \ switching on my torch, I began pulling on all items of clothing within sight.\
  \ I am not a morning person but I\u2019d made an exception for today.\n\nI joined\
  \ the parade of figures already meandering their way up to the Wall, picking my\
  \ route over the loose rocks carefully, conscious that I had only been up for five\
  \ minutes and was extremely susceptible to a sleep-deprived accident. As we reached\
  \ the top, the wind grew stronger and I eyed those who had lugged sleeping bags\
  \ up with them in envy.\n\nThe camping spot was incredible. Having hiked the hour-long\
  \ incline up the side of the Chinese mountains the day previous \u2013 complete\
  \ with camping gear and overnight baggage \u2013 we had pitched our tents in a small,\
  \ flat clearing just below the Wall. As I settled on the Wall\u2019s edge I glanced\
  \ to my right to the remains of last night\u2019s campfire. I willed it to reignite\
  \ instantaneously on this bitter morning.\n\nA year ago I never dreamed that I\u2019\
  d be sitting on an untouched section of the Great Wall of China at 5am, waiting\
  \ for the sun to rise. In fact, I hadn\u2019t even considered visiting China at\
  \ all. When planning my trip around Asia I prioritised places I knew my friends\
  \ and family had been to and loved: Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam \u2013 essentially\
  \ places where I could live in my bikini. Wearing my thermal jumper usually reserved\
  \ for skiing underneath three other layers, waiting for the sun to rise at a time\
  \ I would call \u2018unsociable\u2019, was the last thing I expected to be doing\
  \ \u2013 it was not in my trip plan.\n\nBut it definitely should have been. Huddled\
  \ against my new friends watching the sun slowly make its appearance, drunk on the\
  \ excitement of the occasion and in desperate need of a shower, I felt indescribably\
  \ fortunate.\n\nThe next twenty minutes were filled with millions of photographs\
  \ being taken and numerous variations of \u201CLook at it now!\u201D and \u201C\
  The pictures just don\u2019t show how amazing it looks!\u201D as the scene continued\
  \ to surprise us with its beauty. The sun rose against a clear sky, the mountainous\
  \ Chinese landscape highlighted by the orange and reds of the sun. Gradually the\
  \ outline of the Wall became clear in the growing light; the awe-inspiring structure\
  \ appearing magical against the vibrantly coloured sky.\n\nThis, I would repeatedly\
  \ wake up early for."
