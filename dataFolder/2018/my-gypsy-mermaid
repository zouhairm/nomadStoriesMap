Text: "Laying on the beach in Barceloneta, 2 weeks into my big move, I noticed a pair\
  \ of locals a few meters away that caught my attention. It was was September. She\
  \ was topless. A goldenness covered every inch of her body. Her hair floated in\
  \ the fall breeze like a gypsy Mermaid. Her counterpart had a rolled cigarette in\
  \ one hand and beer can in the other. They shared a bottle of white wine and ate\
  \ green olives out of plastic bag. I was in Spain, sort of! Then, I knew nothing\
  \ about the distinction between Spanish and Catalunya. Culture and politics aside,\
  \ they were luminous, basking in the warmth of one of the last days of the Indian\
  \ summer. \n\nAfter about 17 minutes of anticipation and observation, I conjured\
  \ up the courage to ask them to watch my valuables - a necessary act on the city\
  \ beaches of Barcelona. After rehearing the phrase about 12 times in my head, I\
  \ made my approach. \"Hola...\" I queried in my best accent. \"Of course!\", she\
  \ replied in perfect English. \n\nI walked towards the water in shame and plunging\
  \ into the Med., plotting my salvation. They would be my friends! As I reproached\
  \ my prey, dripping wet, (bikini top securely fastened), they invited me to sit\
  \ with them. Victory. \n\nHer name was Ines. Over the next year, I would break up\
  \ with my Honduran boyfriend that I'd moved with and fall in love with Ines and\
  \ her family as they opened their world to me. Costa Brava beach days in the summer..\
  \ snowy, medieval Pyrenee villages in the winter; because of them, I have experienced\
  \ life here as a local. \n\nIn November 2017, Ines came to my home in Boston for\
  \ Thanksgiving. It was my chance to give back to her, all that she and her family\
  \ had given to me. She met my parents, siblings, aunts & uncles. We sat around the\
  \ fire place after debauchery of Thanksgiving. I got her drunk at my 10-year high\
  \ school reunion and we took the necessary side trip to NYC. Now, she was my alien\
  \ :)\n\nInes' openness to a foreigner living in her city opened my eyes to the reality\
  \ of another culture and all of its unique beauty. More importantly, it has shown\
  \ me that we are all the same. Travel writing is not just about reviewing mouth-watering\
  \ restaurant \"holes\", and waiting in line to visit jaw-dropping architectural\
  \ structures, it's about seeing, in this day and age of creating borders and putting\
  \ up walls that we are all the same. Travel to explore and absorb, not just to observe\
  \ and consume. Leave a little something of yours and take a little something home\
  \ with you."
