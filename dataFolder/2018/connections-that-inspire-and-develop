Text: "I know that life is an amazing journey with lots of open doors. That's why\
  \ I made lots of local connection that have built my life with happiness and well-being.\n\
  From my childhood I've learnt about different creations. Traveling the world and\
  \ getting new contacts were my dream.\nI'm passioned by everything I do. I've worked\
  \ hard and entered university that I've dreamed. I've been learning journalism at\
  \ the philology department in Kharkov National University of Karazina that became\
  \ my 2 home. It has a Student council where everyone can find themselves and develop\
  \ their capabilities. Organization has a Students Blog UNK, where we learn journalism,\
  \ make videos and material about university and city events. In the 2 year I was\
  \ chosen as a student dean of my department that made me more confident and strong\
  \ minded. Together with my team we get good results in each directions: education,\
  \ culture, sport. My Student council helps me to build community of different people\
  \ that are interested in same stuff. Nowadays I'am still in team. We become friends,\
  \ chatting about everything, I believe that it's for a long time. We worked together,\
  \ starting new projects and growing up.\nIn my senior year I unsuspectedly had a\
  \ phone call that became a turning point. Korean community helped me to become a\
  \ part of Korean program \u201COKFriends\u201D. I felt so lucky. And it was for\
  \ free. I thought that I couldn't stay away from chances that were given to me when\
  \ I wasn't expected. I need to move on, looking for opportunities in future and\
  \ communicate with the other people.\nI can absolutely truthfully say that I fell\
  \ in love with my ethnical home. I was happy to be a part of massive youth camp,\
  \ where I met new people from Korea, China, USA, France, Russia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan\
  \ and we became friends. I learnt more about Korea, tradition and wear hanbok. It\
  \ was the 10th camp, we had game summit and debate about North and South Korea.\
  \ I was glad to hear so many opinions. It was strong teambuilding across serious\
  \ topic, mindwork and connection between different nations. I loved the way I finally\
  \ proved my English and had a good language training.\nFor human it's important\
  \ of making local connection that will help in life and become a soulmates. I already\
  \ have experience of making acquaintance with people that almost don't understand\
  \ even English and humans that I'm united in. Now my life consists of love, happiness,\
  \ people that mutually give it back and I'm not gonna stop."
