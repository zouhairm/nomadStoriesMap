Text: "She stepped into the vessel cautiously, crossing from the muddy shore that\
  \ she\u2019d just managed to navigate down through thick vegetation to the wooden\
  \ floor of the long narrow boat. The woman sat straight onto the landing separating\
  \ the seats for \u2018us\u2019 the tourists from the driver\u2019s space. Her feet\
  \ were slightly muddy with just flip flops on; her hands were holding onto a couple\
  \ of plastic bags, possibly the reason for her outing away from her village. The\
  \ boat had just carried the six of us under the bridge connecting the two sides\
  \ of the village of Nong Khiaw, Northern Laos. Our journey was taking us up river\
  \ on the Nam Ou through spectacular karst cliffs. Except for the landing the boat\
  \ was covered by wooden makeshift top protecting its visitors from the sun, whilst\
  \ former office chairs had been adjusted into comfy seats. Being into one of the\
  \ two seats right next to the landing, I was just across from her, the lady who\u2019\
  d joined us by hitching a ride waiving at the boatman from across the expanse of\
  \ the river. Her stature hardly visible from the distance yet she\u2018d managed\
  \ to draw enough attention. I couldn\u2019t help but wonder about her life. Her\
  \ hands and feet surely pointing to a life of manual agricultural work, her clothes\
  \ a tell sign of belonging to one of the hill tribes inhabiting these parts of mountainous\
  \ Laos with no access to roads, running water, or dare say electricity. A woman\
  \ whose journey to Nong Khiaw, 20-odd kilometres down river, was probably the furthest\
  \ she\u2019d ever reached. There I was seated in my office chair curious about her\
  \ life whilst she sat cross-legged on the floor with the sun beaming in her face.\
  \ On bumpy river stretches the boat bobbed up and down over shallower water, she\
  \ simply held onto the sides of boat waiting for it to pass. Her life was likely\
  \ full of burdens yet her face gave away happiness. She shyly smiled at us along\
  \ the way, carefully studying the people she was sharing a ride with. Her voice\
  \ exuded cheerful, joyful tones each time she spoke to the boatman possibly sharing\
  \ a joke or two or simply chatting up about what\u2019s happening in her world.\
  \ She disappeared just as she\u2019d appeared - unexpectedly. The boat approached\
  \ the reed covered shore stopping briefly - no building or village in sight, no\
  \ road or pathway - just vegetation, the river and the surrounding hills. She took\
  \ her bags, dropped a little cash into the driver\u2019s hand, smiled shyly and\
  \ stepped back out onto the muddy banks of the river and into her world."
