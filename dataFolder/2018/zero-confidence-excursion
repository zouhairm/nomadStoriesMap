Text: "How often do we do things that we are told not to do? It\u2019s not sporadic\
  \ for me as my Mom always demonstrates her hesitation and it\u2019s not her fault\
  \ as it is imbibed into her by the creator.  A Sahyadri trek to Harishchandragadh\
  \ fort via nalichi vaat in Indian monsoons is strictly a no-no. At least for a neophyte.\
  \ Being my 9th consecutive weekend trek of the season I wanted to do the most challenging\
  \ trek in the Sahyadris. When on a role we do things that are dreamed on tardy days.\
  \ There is always that excitement to meet new friends. Shook hands with them, remembered\
  \ none of their names, chit-chatted in the taxi, sang some songs, shared some experiences\
  \ and with still no signs of remembering names we reached a small hotel for a tea\
  \ break. Tea break is always a welcome as there is so much to talk over a cutting\
  \ Chai. We reached base village at 2 am and slept on warm cobbled floor. Mornings\
  \ are lazy at six. My daily ablutions skipped bath and a long nature call. I went\
  \ to expel in the open but due to consciousness of the surrounding, it just didn\u2019\
  t slip out. This thing always runs at the back of your mind, isn\u2019t it? Gloomy\
  \ sky, anxious rains, lush green forest, enthusiastic heart and with a blank mind,\
  \ our excursion began. At first, we were walking on a treacherous terrain besides\
  \ a wide and a quiet stream. Amidst all this I was only concentrating on the trek.\
  \ I was that careful. The terrain didn\u2019t allow me to put my head up and walk.\
  \ Stream narrowed and grew wilder. Steepness inclined. Gushing waters became louder.\
  \ Still concentrating on the terrain we walked one after the other. Going by my\
  \ instinct I tried climbing a 6 feet rock in my own weird way. Weird because I encountered\
  \ a back-faced fall from that height right on a pointed stone. Backpacks come handy\
  \ during this crucial time but the stone was wide enough to hurt me on the left\
  \ half of my back. Excruciating with pain I lingered here and there. More than pain\
  \ it was the fear of a fracture. My mind wandered and started thinking what I shouldn\u2019\
  t. My left index fingernail ripped off. A week ago at Dhak Bahiri trek, I was advised\
  \ by an old man to keep my mind free of any worries and climb. A 12 hour trek and\
  \ in the first hour I am injured. In such dire circumstances, a slide show of all\
  \ my loved ones was running vividly in my thoughts. With no choice of going back,\
  \ I continued a \u201CZero Confidence Excursion\u201D which was completed successfully.\
  \ More than fun-filled, it was a journey full of silent prayers."
