Text: "I travelled to Guatemala to visit my Spanish tutor, and I felt an immediate\
  \ kindred spirit. He arranged to have the day off. No work=no pay. I learned more\
  \ about his sad, yet empowering story. I was surprised when he told me his mother\
  \ had been a preacher because he referred to her as Satan. He was hit by a car at\
  \ age 9 and spent a month in a coma. His mother, who was regularly beaten by his\
  \ step-father, sent him to an orphanage. Satan, promised to visit, but never came.\
  \ Jose yearned for his mother's love. After graduation, he entered a facility for\
  \ murderers. I felt a chill run down my spine wondering if he had killed. Some may\
  \ have accepted their fate to live in a vicious cycle of poverty and resort to crime.\
  \ Instead, he \"lied\u201D his way through interviews and worked 2 jobs. \nJose\
  \ methodically searched the official directory for his mother. His dream finally\
  \ came to fruition. He asked the question that occupied his heavy heart, \"Why did\
  \ she give him up all those years ago?\"  He was candid about his excessive addictions\
  \ to numb. If his mother is Satan, Jose claims he is the Devil. He shared the dark\
  \ story of his 2 younger brothers. One joined a gang. As retaliation, opposing gangsters\
  \ came to their home, and mom and sister witnessed brutal executions. Everything\
  \ one may stereotype about Honduran poverty runs through the blood lines of Jose\u2019\
  s heritage. Jose has family values and work ethics that I admire. He provides financial\
  \ sustenancefor 9 family members, but is constantly exasperated. They only know\
  \ survival. Today.  \nThe following day, he would escort me, yo subu a la volcan.\
  \ The day was disappointing.  Satin is right (he has demons), but she fuelled them.\
  \ Jose ingested various toxic substances. The money I had give him fell out of his\
  \ pocket just before he vomited. I was sad and angry. I soaked in amazing viewpoints\
  \ holding tears as we climbed. Jose asked if I would advance for more lessons. NO.\
  \ I was not paying for self-destruction. We never reached the peak retracing our\
  \ steps. The boat ride back was eerily quiet. Before I left Guatemala, I played\
  \ devils advocate asking: is it possible Satan gave him the chance to succeed by\
  \ leaving him. He voiced his anger. Why did she not come? Is it possible, FEAR of\
  \ rape, beaten, crucified. \nI believe Jose can live a quality life despite his\
  \ demons. He is smart, handsome, funny, and kind. One day we will hike above the\
  \ clouds of Volcan San Pedro together."
