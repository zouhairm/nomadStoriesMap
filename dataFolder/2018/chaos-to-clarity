Text: "I step outside the airport as I had many times before directly into the smell\
  \ of rancid garbage which filled my nostrils and quickly made me uneasy. After an\
  \ agonizing plane ride, I arrived to Mumbai and was instantly reminded of my hesitation\
  \ to visit. Tired, hungry, and desperate for a shower, I look around and spot my\
  \ mother eagerly waiting to greet me. I plaster a smile on my face and make my way\
  \ over. \n\nThe car ride home was filled with the sight of stray dogs digging through\
  \ garbage and a driver whose sobriety was questionable. I arrive at my grandparents\
  \ house completely defeated. I had just arrived, and all I could imagine was my\
  \ return to the USA. I walk into the bathroom, washed the last 24 hours of pure\
  \ agony off of my body and decide to make the most of the next 14 days. \n\nI had\
  \ to get into the hang of speaking Marathi, my mother tongue, a language I was not\
  \ used to speaking often. My grandmother had prepared my favorite dish, sheera,\
  \ and it\u2019s rich aroma caused my mouth to water. However, did I have the heart\
  \ to tell her that I developed an allergy and couldn\u2019t eat it anymore? The\
  \ abundance of love in her eyes forced me to catch my tongue and just suffer the\
  \ consequences that night. I would tell her tomorrow morning.\n\nI spent the next\
  \ morning trying to assimilate. I was told we were going to visit a famous landmark\
  \ from the 18th century involving a warrior and his triumph over the Moguls. I had\
  \ seen the Bollywood version but doubted how exciting it would actually be.\n\n\
  I stepped out from the taxi and immediately felt connected to this place. The guide\
  \ explained the background of this warrior, his love affair and his battles. I listened\
  \ intently, absorbing every word, and then it happened. \n\nThe guide mentioned\
  \ the warrior spoke Marathi, my mother tongue, and for some reason this piece of\
  \ information made me ecstatic. As a child, listening to stories of freedom fighters\
  \ and warriors, I had heard of Indians from other states, but here I was standing\
  \ proud at the sight of a Maharashtrian fighting to maintain our lands. A maharashtrian,\
  \ the reason India, at that time, was kept safe from the Moguls. \n\nA deep sense\
  \ of pride was present as I stood gleaming. That one sliver of information had turned\
  \ this trip from boring and, quite honestly, revolting to one of connection with\
  \ my roots and engagement in a rich culture. Suddenly I found myself wanting to\
  \ learn more about this place. Funny how hesitation quickly turned to fascination\
  \ and pride."
