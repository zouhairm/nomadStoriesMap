Text: "So there I was for my third straight day living in the Dublin airport. Seven\
  \ more days until my flight home to the States but I wasn't sure how I was going\
  \ to last another night on the floor, maybe I would get lucky and score a bench\
  \ seat. I wasn't sure what to do but I knew one more night would drive me crazy.\
  \ One way or another I had to get out of the airport.\nOkay, let me rewind a litte.\
  \ Before Dublin I was staying in London for a study abroad program studying theatre\
  \ and history. After the program ended I flew to Ireland to stay with my friend\
  \ attending Trinity College Dublin. That is when the most unexpected series of events\
  \ happened. I walked off the plane to a message from my friend, her study abroad\
  \ in Tanzania had been extended and she would not be back. I had not budgeted for\
  \ ten days worth of housing in the city but figured I could pull off a cheap hostel.\
  \ That's when things really hit the fan, I called to book a room to discover my\
  \ card had been flagged for fraud and could not be used. So there I was standing\
  \ in the Dublin airport, no place to stay, 20 euro in my pocket, and 1 more day\
  \ left on my pre-paid international phone. I had no idea at the time that this unfortunate\
  \ series of events would lead to one of the greatest adventures of my life. \nNow\
  \ in this situation I did what any rational person would do, I called my mother.\
  \ Flash forward to day three when everything changed. My mother contacted me with\
  \ the news that an opening had finally come up at a hostel. I jumped on the next\
  \ bus into the city and was on my way to unexpected adventure. I settled in at the\
  \ Kings Hostel, unfolded my free city map, slapped my last 10 Euro on the table\
  \ and got to work. I made a list of everything free to do in the city and set my\
  \ plan of attack for the next morning. Over breakfast I met a Canadian named Charles\
  \ who joined me for some the days adventures exploring the National Museums. That\
  \ evening Charles made us dinner back at the hostel where we met people from all\
  \ over the world. With the generosity of my new friends I was able to conquer the\
  \ whole city. We explored the beauty of Phoenix park, live music and Guinness at\
  \ Temple Bar, and I even met my \"Galway Girl\", though technically she was Welsh.\
  \ I had never expected events to unfold as they did but it turned into a valuable\
  \ life lesson. It's not about the places we go but the people we meet along the\
  \ way. Ireland brought life long friends and a renewed love of adventure. So when\
  \ is your next adventure?"
