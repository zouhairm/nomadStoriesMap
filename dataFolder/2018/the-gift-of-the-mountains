Text: "\"Use the power of your legs, not the power of your lungs\", enunciated Chhering\
  \ smiling at my short of breath move to the hilltop meditation cave, where monks\
  \ meditate at one of the most astounding elevations in the world. I could scarcely\
  \ bring a little appearance of my grin at him and kept pushing myself to the top\
  \ to assimilate the magnificent beauty of Tabo, a Spitian town settled in the lap\
  \ of Himalayas.\n\nAs I continued putting one foot before the other, over and over\
  \ on the slipshod path and battling the sharp sun and chilly breeze brushing my\
  \ face, his words continued ringing in my brain. Indeed, the energy of the legs\
  \ is the thing that I have to get to my goal, his words by and by kicks in with\
  \ some intensity this time and I attempted to move quicker. \n\nChhering was a passionate\
  \ Spitian, who knew the valley like the back of his palm. He influenced our two-week\
  \ trip by including cultural trails at each location we ceased by. One can find\
  \ him in barley fields or at home cooking a meal when not on the move.\n\nI sat\
  \ by a Stupa, the mountains and its reserves, the fluttering prayer flags, the Indo-Tibetan\
  \ Buddhist culture resembled an escape to an alternate existence and limitless potential\
  \ and at that moment I was flabbergasted by the energy of the mountains. \n\n\"\
  Each mountain ridge of Spiti has a lurking story, a mountaintop changes hues amid\
  \ the day, mirroring the mindset of the god that inhabits it, Chhering exclaimed.\
  \ Furthermore, Spiti is a place of legends and miracles have occurred here. The\
  \ Mahakal statue, defender of Dharma declined to move when the monastery was moved\
  \ because of a dry spell, but was wrecked in a quake, be that as it may, the statue\
  \ remained untouched in the midst of a devastating tremor, instilling faith and\
  \ heavenliness of the place \", by and by, a feeling of pride resounded in his voice\
  \ while the group and I gazed at him and the mountains. \n\nAs he paused, I hopped\
  \ out to let him know, \"Cherring Ji, you talk great English.\"I learned the language\
  \ on the job as a travel guide, I didn't have any formal education\", his eyes overflowed\
  \ proudly as he revealed how travel helps him meet diverse individuals and appreciates\
  \ being part of responsible tourism and the way of life and history of Spiti. \n\
  \nI held onto hush as I strolled back feeling grateful to be immersed in the glory\
  \ of the place, the Himalayas, the mystical feel of the faith and the humility of\
  \ the people. It's all real, perhaps one needs to discover, mumbled my mind."
