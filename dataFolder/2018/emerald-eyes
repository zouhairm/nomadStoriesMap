Text: "My favourite days were always the ones when I didn't know where I was sleeping.\
  \ When it got to midnight and I wandered through deserted streets searching for\
  \ the cheapest hostel vacancies. The unknown consumed me; I was completely engrossed\
  \ in the exquisitely beautiful yet simple idea of just being elsewhere. I often\
  \ caught myself dreaming of living that way forever. I made the decision to go to\
  \ Paris and several hours later I found myself on an overnight train. A constant\
  \ never ending high- a euphoric feeling took over my mind and soul as I wandered\
  \ those magical streets. I soon realised that Paris was the kind of city I could\
  \ fall in love with. You don't need to search for light and beauty as it's always\
  \ right there. Perhaps that's where the infatuation for the city grew from- constant,\
  \ uninterrupted beauty. In that moment I noticed a young girl, huddled amongst her\
  \ family of 5 staring at me with sunken eyes the colour of an emerald. The kind\
  \ I could tell held a burden far too heavy for the beholder. \n\"Are you hungry?\"\
  \ I asked the girl with the emerald eyes. A smile quickly spread across mouth as\
  \ she nodded. I was never exposed to homeless people as I grew up in a sheltered\
  \ town. It never got easier, it was something I could not accept. I purchased food\
  \ for the young family and sat alongside them. I didn't want to leave, how was I\
  \ living so well whilst a whole family was suffering. That's when my infatuation\
  \ for not only Paris but the whole of Europe suddenly didn't matter. A tear slid\
  \ down my cheek. The family looked at me. 10 sunken eyes stared right through me\
  \ as I wept. No one spoke a word, but no words were needed. The girl with the emerald\
  \ eyes grabbed my hand, she nodded at me. Her eyes sparkled just a little bit, enough\
  \ to let me know that they would be okay. Every night for the remainder of my week\
  \ in Paris I returned to the exact same spot in the hopes of seeing the family again.\
  \ I never saw them.\nSometimes I find myself wishing I did more. I learned in that\
  \ moment, and many moments to come that we are all human. We are all equals. In\
  \ my heart I carry the girl with the emerald eyes and her family wherever I go,\
  \ I often dream of them warm and safe- in a world we can only dream of."
