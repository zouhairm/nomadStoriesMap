Text: "The last thing you can expect going to Gran-Canaria - suffer because of the\
  \ wind, snow, sun and rain at the same time and being hilariously happy about it.\
  \ Be grateful to these continents in miniature for all the feelings you got. Because\
  \ every day of the visit will be an amazing adventure you will never forget. Born\
  \ in all elements Canary gave fulfilling experiences if you are brave enough to\
  \ try.\nJust leave your comfy hotel on the southern beach and start climbing up.\
  \ The first climb wouldn't be dangerous: just go up on the highest dune in Maspalomas,\
  \ pour out the send from your shorts and throw them away - you are on the nudist\
  \ beach! Feel free and happy, fix this feeling just rolling down from the dune like\
  \ a roll. Pretty happy roll. Then if you are ready for challenge pack a backpack\
  \ and start climbing mountains. Million years ago all of them were active volcanos,\
  \ now most of them are tired. But it's not about you! Go further at least 15 km\
  \ and refresh yourself with cactus-fruits. Be careful with prickles! They can stack\
  \ in your lips and throat. Anyway its the most refreshing thing on the way except\
  \ water and oranges. But both of these beautiful things you will meet only from\
  \ the other side of high fences, so... Refresh yourself with cactus or climb fences\
  \ too.\nNext day you will probably struggle with pain in muscles and lack of water.\
  \ Don't cry, you wouldn't die, just keep on going and remember the feeling. After\
  \ this experience, simple moments of drinking water or just lying on the ground\
  \ will make you incredibly happy person. So easy - no need for psychologist and\
  \ medicines. Also, you'll become more strong and smart. Just keep going. The third\
  \ day will come and you are happy and wise will drag 10 litres of water until the\
  \ next spring just for feeling safe. Finally, you'll look around and amuse that\
  \ you are still on the same island but landscape changed totally. From red dry desert\
  \ to fluffy pine forest. Get wet under the rain in Tejeda and meat incredible sunset\
  \ on Roque Nublo. Look 360 degrees around the beautiful world. Look at peace and\
  \ happiness inside you. \nNow it's time going down. Experience views of Tamadaba\
  \ park, get lost and find yourself. Clean the road dust in natural volcanic swimming-pools\
  \ of Agaete. Come back to the nudist beach, lay naked and happy. Now the new person\
  \ is born inside of you.\nWhen the send storm will come - just stand up and go further.\
  \ Things are happening and you are ready to be happy with them."
