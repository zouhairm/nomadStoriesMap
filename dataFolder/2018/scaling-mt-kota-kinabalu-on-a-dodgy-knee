Text: "Scaling Mt Kota Kinabalu On A Dodgy Knee \n\n\n\nKorpilahti, Finland; \"Suomi\"\
  \ 100-year-old wealthy republic with its trees, clean lakes, and a few mountains\
  \ the highest 1,300m. \n\nKorpilahti my childhood village. I was 9 when I was hit\
  \ by black BMW. It was  ealy Boxing Day morning, and I was eager to try my Xmas\
  \ pressie a new kick-sled. Out the door. No permission from grandma. On main road\
  \ downhil, the curve the Beemer. Crash! Blood, multiple fractures and a destroyed\
  \ knee joint. I became a limper looking for a mountain.\n\n\nIn my 20s I found \
  \ Mt Matterhorn  like a picture postcard. Zermatt village I saw the graveyard with\
  \ tombstones of fallen climbers. Unlucky bastards cartwheeling, bouncing off Matterhorn's\
  \ H\xF6rnli ridge. One stone reads: \"I Chose To Climb\" D.S Williams. Died July\
  \ 1975.   \n\nThe 80s India, Kashmir and Ladakh northernmost India where the air\
  \ is thin and mountains are old and dusty. Alt. 2,600m. \n\nA decade later finally\
  \ the Himalayas. Nepal, Katmandu. 'Limping Johnny' bound for Lukla and Namche Bazar,\
  \ the gateway to Mt Everest base camp. \u201CNo flight today.\" Dense fog. Lukla\
  \ flight \"Maybe tomorrow\" Back to Katmandu. I decide to have Osso Bucco for dinner.\
  \ In the night food poisoning with projectile vomit and explosive diarrhea. Dehydrated,\
  \ pale and trembling I return to Bangkok. In Nepal order lentil soup, Dal Bhat the\
  \ National Dish. Respect the local cuisine.\n\n2000 the mountains are calling, again.\
  \ This time Mt Kinabalu the highest peak in South East Asia. \n\nMt Kinabalu. My\
  \ chance. Never mind the damaged knee and extra kilos. Timphom Gate. Mt. Kinabalu\
  \ starting point 8 am. I and my guide Jason Ong hit the trail through a steamy,\
  \ tropical rainforest. Endless steps. Up meter after meter. At 3,333m Laban Rata\
  \ Resthouse halfway point. Sleep. 3:30 am on the montain again. Headlamps, steep\
  \ ascents, ladders and thick fixed ropes. Final attack! Low's peak a freezing, treeless,\
  \ windy slab of granite 4,010m above sea level. Sunrise with big vistas of Borneo\
  \ rainforest's and the South China Sea. Whipped by the freezing wind the Get Down\
  \ starts. The 9-nine kilometer long knee-breaking descent. Hopping and sliding on\
  \ slippery rocks, boulders, and roots. \n\nFinal steep steps. Back at Timpohan Gate.\
  \ I thank my guide and limp like a wounded soldier to the van.\n\nOnwards to Kota\
  \ Kinabalu - Kuala Lumpur and back to Bangkok, Thailand. \n\nI have decided. I must\
  \ have a TKR Total Knee Replacement. My old damaged knee joint OUT! - New hardware,\
  \ prosthesis IN! Enough limping!"
