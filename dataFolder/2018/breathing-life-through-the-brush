Text: "I did not come to look at the Duomo, in all her glory and artistry, but to\
  \ watch the watchers. The fanatics, lunatics, families and schemers and of late,\
  \ one quiet artist. \nA small but clamorous group was huddled at her stand, some\
  \ peering at the portraits of Italian children, propped against the easels, others\
  \ admiring the illustrated horizons of Verona and Venice. The paintings were at\
  \ the very least, miraculous.\nAn elderly signora, who looked distinctly anything\
  \ but Italian, looked not at her crowd but out at the passers-by, much like I did.\
  \ I saw her every day, and every day she did the same. This afternoon my curiosity\
  \ got the better of me.\n\u2018Be careful to watch your paintings, or someone will\
  \ make a grab at them,\u2019 I say to her as I\u2019ve walked to her aged wooden\
  \ stool.\n\u2018Someone may steal one today, and again tomorrow, but it\u2019s not\
  \ a worry. I have plenty of time to paint more.'\n'I have seen you reading Odysseus\u2019\
  \ adventures from back to front,\u2019 she says, amused. \u2018Why?\u2019\n\u2018\
  I like knowing that the story will end well, a happy ending.\u2019\n\u2018Real life\
  \ is not so kind.\u2019\n\u2018Perhaps it is. I've not had a sad ending yet.\u2019\
  \n\u2018I\u2019ve known too many sad endings,\u2019 she says. \u2018I was in the\
  \ Israeli army. I fought in Milhemet Sheshet Ha Yamim. The Six-day war. I was a\
  \ woman who was good with a gun and so I was respected. I killed fifty-seven people\
  \ in those few days. Other good men and women. Now I repent by telling the stories\
  \ of the people I killed, in the hope God will forgive me. I paint any details of\
  \ their faces I can remember into my pieces. You see this one of Piazzale Michelangelo?\
  \ Don\u2019t bother looking at the Chiesa, look at that man strolling along this\
  \ strada. This painting of the Ponte Vecchio? Only observe the girl, barely a woman,\
  \ trying to caress the Arno. I paint sunsets, and landscapes, and buildings without\
  \ thinking. They are beautiful, but I am numbed to their effects. Now I only paint\
  \ as my personal catharsis. I sit here and paint or watch, every day in the summer,\
  \ even on more bitter days. If I am not here, I am most probably dead.\u2019\nSo\
  \ for eight days I visited her, and each night I would cry remembering the painter\u2019\
  s stories of war, and the imagined lives of the people her bullets had silenced.\n\
  On the ninth day I came to her spot, just past noon as always. She was not there,\
  \ but I smiled knowing she had told the stories she felt were her duty to tell,\
  \ and I had welcomed them into my heart, carrying them on so they could live. I\
  \ would not shed a tear that night."
