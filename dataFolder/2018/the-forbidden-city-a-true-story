Text: "I don\u2019t need to pinch myself. The searing pain in my left hand tells me\
  \ that this nightmare is real. I\u2019m growing tired from the effort of trying\
  \ to hold our front door closed\u2026 bracing myself against the brute force of\
  \ the man outside trying to break in. I cannot tell if I\u2019m shaking because\
  \ of the effort I\u2019m exerting or because of the terror I feel.\n\nMy two friends\
  \ across the room are desperately trying to contact the police, our family and our\
  \ host to let them know we are in trouble. As I finally lose my grip on the door\
  \ handle I catch my friends\u2019 eyes\u2026 with tears streaming down my face,\
  \ all I can manage to say is \u201CI am so sorry, this is my fault, I booked this\
  \ place...\"\n\nWe\u2019d been on the ground in Beijing for less than an hour when\
  \ an irate local confronted us as we entered our Airbnb apartment in North Doncheng.\
  \ Tired from our evening flight and already edgy from our navigation through the\
  \ dark, unfamiliar, narrow mazes that forms the traditional hutong (alleyway) area\
  \ - I was quick to react.\n\nI gave a dismissive wave of my hands to usher him away\
  \ and closed the door firmly behind us. Retreating into our apartment, we were happy\
  \ to catch our breath. Our feeling of relief was short lived. Unperturbed, the local\
  \ stranger continued to knock at our courtyard door. At first we thought he would\
  \ grow tired of his game and give up as long as we didn\u2019t respond or encourage\
  \ him.\n\nHowever over the next 15 minutes he grew bolder, entering our private\
  \ courtyard and knocking on all our windows \u2013 first gently, then banging louder\
  \ and more persistently. He soon grew more agitated and started yelling and trying\
  \ to kick down the front door of our apartment - seemingly hell bent on entering.\n\
  \nAfter several desperate and fruitless calls to the local police for help, our\
  \ Airbnb host arrived in response to our SOS message via WeChat. Speaking fluent\
  \ Mandarin he pacified the man in question and called out to me, \u201CHannah, he\u2019\
  s upset \u2013 do you have something of his in the apartment?\u201D\n\nTo my disbelief,\
  \ I had just unwittingly played a part in my first massive Chinese cultural misunderstanding.\
  \ We had committed a Chinese sin by using a torch we had found outside the apartment\
  \ to help find out way inside in the dark.\n\nTo my surprise, my host didn\u2019\
  t give us any sympathy. He simply said: \u201CYou don\u2019t come to China for a\
  \ holiday Hannah, you come here for an adventure.\u201D\nAnd if today\u2019s events\
  \ were anything to go by, that is certainly a mindset that I would need to adopt\
  \ rather quickly."
