Text: "About five years ago, I won a three weeks trip to Italy. I wanted to travel\
  \ so bad, but didn't have enough money to do so. Forget the all-included vacations.\
  \ I didn't care for that. I wanted to discover the world, and I didn't think laying\
  \ on a beach with beers and drinks for seven days would help me with that. When\
  \ I won, I was extatic. I did a lot of research about the places I wanted to visit,\
  \ the things I wished to see. I knew I would love this amazing trip. But I didn't\
  \ expect to be breathless in front of these things I saw. One day, I got out of\
  \ the subway station, and my heart skipped a beat. When you step outside that particular\
  \ subway station, you find yourself in front of the Colosseo. That view was unbelievable.\
  \ I got tears in my eyes and I started to realize that people around me (italians),\
  \ didn't even seem to notice the monument standing right there. I was shocked. How\
  \ could they ignore the beauty of it? And the history behind those walls! The answer\
  \ is simple. That's because they see it everyday.\nIt got me thinking about my life.\
  \ The beautiful things I see on a daily basis, and never notice anymore. We get\
  \ used to anything. Everything. Everyone does it. Think about it. When you buy a\
  \ brand new car, you are so careful with it, but after a while, you start to care\
  \ less about it, you desire something different. When you scratch it for the first\
  \ time, you're mad, but the second time, it doesn't really matter anymore. \nSo\
  \ I was standing there, looking at one of the seven new wonders, and I was so inspired\
  \ by it. When I visited it, I remember telling my mother \xABYou can't tell me you\
  \ don't wish you were born when there were gladiators and when this got build.\xBB\
  \ I felt so many things while walking within these walls, climbing those stairs...\
  \ \nTravelling to me means experiencing new feelings. Feelings I never get when\
  \ I'm home. Feelings that wake when you try different things. When you live an unexpected\
  \ life. Especially when you do things that scare you. Things you wouldn't do naturally,\
  \ but you do them anyway, because you know you will experience something great and\
  \ you'll be happy you did it afterwards. I wanna travel the world, I wanna feel\
  \ things I never felt before. I wanna be amazed and scared. I wanna see, not just\
  \ look. I wanna taste, not just eat. I wanna hear local stories that will make me\
  \ laugh or cry or even better, both. Because that's what life is all about. We are\
  \ not made to be comfortable. We are meant to live. Travel. Discover.Feel"
