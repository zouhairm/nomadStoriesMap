Text: "With every step I took, my pristine Nike sneakers would get suction-cupped\
  \ back into the mud. My five-foot guide, who had already made it halfway up the\
  \ mountain, kept looking back and asking me, are you ok? Despite my ill-fated sneakers,\
  \ I was perfect. I was hiking a mountain somewhere in the Ta Van village in Sapa,\
  \ Vietnam. It had rained the previous day so the mud and the visibility were not\
  \ ideal conditions to see the vastness of the rice terraces that Sapa is known for.\
  \ When I finally arrived at the top, Khu, my guide, was sitting and waiting for\
  \ me on a damp rock. \n\nShe asked me how old I was and if I was married. Normally,\
  \ these questions in succession would always bring on a defensive mode but she looked\
  \ harmless enough. I told her I was 35 and that I had just quit my job a month earlier\
  \ to travel the world. She said that at my age I would be a grandmother in her village.\
  \ To say our worlds were ions a part would be an understatement. \n\nKhu then told\
  \ me she was 22, married with 2 young children. She is the primary income earner\
  \ of her household. Not only does she work as a tour guide for Sapa Sisters, she\
  \ works on her family\u2019s farm and supports her in-laws as well. I asked her\
  \ about the struggles of keeping the traditional role of a woman (e.g. cooks and\
  \ cleans) and the demands of being a working mom. She thought about it for a moment,\
  \ then looked up at me and said she was happy to be working. To have a purpose.\
  \ \n\nKhu asked me all the places I had traveled to and the places I still had left\
  \ on this trip. As I recounted each country, some of them she didn\u2019t even know,\
  \ she would nod and smile. When I was done, she sighed and said, \u201Cmaybe in\
  \ another life.\u201D My usual reply would be, do it now but sitting there in Sapa,\
  \ I really didn\u2019t know if Khu could even if she wanted to. \n\nWe sat there\
  \ in silence looking out at the fog. You couldn\u2019t see much but we sat there\
  \ as two women making the most out of our lives. Both of us made choices to make\
  \ our lives better in our own way. I broke the silence and said, that this moment\
  \ right here, is why I love to travel. To meet women like you from around the world\
  \ and to realize that we are all the same. We all want to have a purpose. To have\
  \ our lives mean something. She hugged me and said, then you will have to share\
  \ our stories.\n\nEven though I didn\u2019t get my Instagram worthy photo of the\
  \ rice terraces in Sapa, I found my purpose in life."
