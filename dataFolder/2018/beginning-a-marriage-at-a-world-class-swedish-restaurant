Text: "The gravel we\u2019re driving on is almost as smooth as the roads we left a\
  \ while back. My new wife and I are sitting in the back of a taxi, bathing in a\
  \ quiet buzz of mounting anticipation, watching dense pine forest pass by. The forest\
  \ is uninterrupted save for the occasional section that\u2019s been neatly logged.\
  \ Each section has a tree or two left standing to reseed it, mothers to the newly\
  \ emptied spaces. It\u2019s the smart way to do it, our driver says. In mid-May,\
  \ pockets of snow still linger on the ground.\n\nA splash of yellow breaks the lull.\
  \ The vibrant sign stands out from the dusky green of the forest. With a blend of\
  \ pride and triumph, I think, \u201CHow many restaurants can say they have their\
  \ own road sign?\u201D F\xE4viken, deep in Sweden\u2019s remote J\xE4mtland County,\
  \ does. The last thing I expected I\u2019d ever do was travel over 3,500 miles for\
  \ dinner, yet here we are tonight.\n\n\nAs an American, my perception of Nordic\
  \ food had boiled down to pickled herring, \u201CThe Muppets\u2019\u201D Swedish\
  \ Chef, and Swedish Meatballs. My narrow-minded assumptions were smashed by Chef\
  \ Magnus Nilsson, whose work at Fa\xE4viken was featured by the PBS series \u201C\
  The Mind of a Chef.\u201D  Thus began my fascination for the range of ingredients\
  \ and techniques used by the New Nordic cuisine movement.\n\nSomething about Nilsson\u2019\
  s cooking, his personality, his near-obsessive dedication to seasonality and regionally\
  \ available ingredients grabbed me stronger than anybody else\u2019s cooking before.\
  \ I watched his humble genius create dishes with a simple, almost austere beauty,\
  \ both in their conception and their execution. That F\xE4viken has two Michelin\
  \ stars, and at the time was the 19th best restaurant in the world, didn\u2019t\
  \ hurt my interest.\n\nWhen my wife and I got married in 2016, we began discussing\
  \ honeymoon options. The incongruity of a Nordic honeymoon appealed to us, as did\
  \ the countries themselves. We ended up planning a sprawling two-week tour of the\
  \ region, building it around our F\xE4viken reservation.\n\n\nFour hours, a bottle\
  \ of wine, and more than 30 courses later, we're sitting in sheepskin-lined chairs\
  \ on F\xE4viken\u2019s front porch, deeply contented. Painted blue by distance,\
  \ the surrounding mountains are serenely imposing. At eleven at night, only about\
  \ 125 miles south of the Arctic Circle, the sun has yet to set. F\xE4viken has been\
  \ more than an incredible, delicious and thought-provoking experience: the meal\
  \ offered a deep dive into Sweden\u2019s food culture; an ideal anchor for our trip\
  \ and, more so, for our young marriage."
