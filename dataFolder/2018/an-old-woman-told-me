Text: "Have yHave you ever been in Sicily? No? that's no good. I know that there are\
  \ million place in the world, expecialy in Italy where the place, the food, the\
  \ wine everywhere is amazing.\nI had a trip in west Sicily from San Vito lo Capo\
  \ to Marsala: it\u2019s easy if you take a car and drive long the coast. \nThe best\
  \ way to discover this region is in this way, in my opinion. You can lose your eyes\
  \ into the blue sea, and few kilometers later in a wild land without nothing\u2026\
  only few house on the street with an old man sit on his bench.\nSan Vito is where\
  \ you can find the best beaches on the north of Sicily: long, with a soft sand and\
  \ a magnificent view. you can sit, swim, and eat a tipica food \u201Ccannolo\u201D\
  : a rolled sweet with ricotta and cioccolato.\ntake your can and drive to Trapani,\
  \ the biggest city on the west coast: but if you stop at Erice, a small town on\
  \ the top of the mountain near Trapani, is where you can find the magic.\nThere\
  \ are a lot of church and monasteries, small bakery and you can\u2019t understand\
  \ why it\u2019s so magic: I was wandering in front of a small place all off this\
  \ when I met a old woman. She saw my estasiate face and she already knows why. She\
  \ toke me in few place, not for common visitors, telling about what and why they\
  \ are so famous for the locals. I felt like one of them, into their history, habits,\
  \ and this \u201Cgrandma\u201D made me discover what is real Travelling: share..it\u2019\
  s all about sharing\nmy eyes where different for the rest part of the experience.\
  \ all the other cities, where I visited the main point, eat all the dishes that\
  \ they suggest, I tasted all the differents kind of wine has been done looking for\
  \ a few words from them.\nThat\u2019s why in Marsala, visiting a Wineyeard I ask\
  \ to a woman to help me in find somethings for eat, and talk, talk, talk, I went\
  \ with her in her house and she prepared me a succulent \u201Carancino\u201D.\n\
  Maybe you can say that\u2019s it\u2019s all about coincidence but this is no right:\
  \ It\u2019s all about how you feel the travel, if you are your travel, if you want\
  \ to share and not only take something from this experience. I\u2019m sure that\
  \ in some place is easiest than in other ( people are not always friendly and open\
  \ minded) but if you can change you prospective everything around you can change."
