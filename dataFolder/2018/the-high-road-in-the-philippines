Text: A friend and I was traveling around the Philippines. We where in Sagada and
  wanted to go back down to Baguio on the scenic Halsema highway. We wanted to travel
  on top of a local jeepney as we had don most time when we had the time and didn't
  just had to get from a-z. But for some reason we couldn't get any for this trip,
  every time we asked a jeepney driver to help us get to Bauio the told us to get
  a local bus, no jeepney was going there, so the only thing we could get was the
  normal local busses packed with locals and turist, and with only a bit of view on
  one side, not the larger picture as we where used to. We stopped in several cities
  on the way to try to change our transportation, only to get the same explanation
  and take the next bus. At the end when we where about to give up, so we gave it
  one last change and walk over to jeepney and instead of asking him to help us get
  to Baguio, we asked him if he where driving north or south. He was going south,
  awesome we thought that the way we are going, so we asked if we could get a ride
  for as long as he was on the highway and of course no problem. That was when we
  realised we had tried to cover to large a distant with a transportation that only
  did local transport. The Philippines that we asked to help us where to focused on
  helping us to get to Baguio not think that any turist wanted to travel that distance
  on to of a jeepney. From there on we had no problem getting a jeepney and after
  7 changes we decided to jump back on the bus for the last bit of the trip.
