Text: "\u201CPlease don't leave so soon,\u201D Achi, owner of the only shop in the\
  \ Tangse village, pleaded in broken Hindi, \u201CI seldom get anyone to talk to;\n\
  Foreigners don't understand our language and the Indians don't visit this place.\u201D\
  \ \nI could only empathize with the loneliness of the teenage Zanskari girl who\
  \ had never left the remote Kargyak valley. So, I ordered another cup of tea and\
  \ she happily poured me an aromatic bittersweet dark green brew that was misnomered\
  \ as tea. \n\u201CDon't worry Achi, in a year or two the road construction would\
  \ complete, then you will have a lot of people coming to your valley.\u201D I comforted\
  \ her, but to my surprise, she just laughed and said, \u201CThat is what I am afraid\
  \ of,\u201D \n\u201CWhat the road?\u201D\n\u201CYes, first the road will come, then\
  \ more people will come, then money and finally everyone will become so money minded\
  \ that the culture of the valley would get corrupted.\u201D\nI laughed at her paranoia.\
  \ \n\u201CThe road will bring the development Achi,\u201D I informed her, \u201C\
  schools, electricity, hospitals\u201D\n\u201CWhat good are schools if there are\
  \ no children? All the children have been sent to the city to study. Do you think\
  \ the kids who have seen the comfort of the city will live in this village?\u201D\
  \n\u201CAchi, if the standard of living improves here, who wouldn't want to live\
  \ here?\u201D\n\u201CTry enduring the Zanskari winters and you would know,\u201D\
  \ she retorted and busied herself in knitting the woollen sweater. I chose to remain\
  \ silent and looked at the green barley fields stepped among the white mud houses,\
  \ and in the backdrop of azure skies and brown mountains they pictured a beautiful\
  \ painting, \n\u201Cbut people had each other and they would embrace the harshness\
  \ of nature together. You will bring electricity, and people would snuggle up inside\
  \ their houses and watch TVs. That's what you do in the cities right?\u201D\n\u201C\
  So, you think that life should remain as it is in the village?\u201D\n\u201CNo,\
  \ not all,\u201D  she smiled and said, \u201Cchange is the rule of nature but if\
  \ you would force feed your idea of development on people who already are developed\
  \ spiritually, you would end up creating another race of dissatisfied people wandering\
  \ in the Himalayas looking for peace.\u201D\nI thanked Achi for the tea, and my\
  \ first well-cooked meal after days of unsuccessful cutlery experiments on the trek.\
  \ I walked through the barley fields of the small Tangse village that housed no\
  \ more than twenty families living content in their idea of happiness and development."
