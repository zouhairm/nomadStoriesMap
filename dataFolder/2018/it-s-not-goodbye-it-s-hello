Text: "As my presumably fabulous L.A. life was crumbling around me, my ego & spirit\
  \ went head to heart. The reeking suspicion was setting in that the greatest love\
  \ affair I\u2019d come to know, my marriage to the City of Angels, was nearing its\
  \ end. Like any great love there\u2019s simply no way to predict the story\u2019\
  s evolution. And, like many great narratives, what seemed to be a grueling devastation\
  \ was actually an ignition of rebirth. California was a hell of a ride, but one\
  \ that was starting to feel like the gas tank was teetering on empty. I trekked\
  \ there at twenty years old from sweet home Alabama with so much pride, I was sure\
  \ I\u2019d never run out of gas. As my resistance began to subside, the idea of\
  \ an adventure was taking reign. Suffice it to say, there was no cushion lying around,\
  \ but I was slowly readying myself to toss over the keys. \nWhere is my life headed?\
  \ Who am I without this identity? It was a bleak road with no glimmering light in\
  \ sight, aside from my one compelling instinct to flee for southeast Asia. How am\
  \ I going to manage that? As I watched my home, Venice Beach, turn over & succumb\
  \ to the gentrification that was part of a greater change within the city, I watched\
  \ my wallet fall prey to these changes as well. I could no longer upkeep with the\
  \ ever demanding market, unless I wanted to live to work, and that I did not. The\
  \ burning smell of Balinese incense kept lurking over my way. \nTravel goals were\
  \ actually a great diversion amid my California demise, an easy talking point of\
  \ reasoning to others. Naturally, as change was setting in, these others were in\
  \ sheer opposition. \u201CIf you leave, that\u2019s it.\u201D Of course there were\
  \ lurking fears. Have I failed? Am I going backward? But, really such a declaration\
  \ rings as music to my rebellious ears. I typically reject being bound to anything.\
  \ As an astrology mentor once acutely proclaimed, \u201CYou\u2019re a bird with\
  \ a perch, not a cage.\u201D \nTrue that. \nAfter all, I felt like I was drowning\
  \ in a sea of expectations. I was sinking in the vast, vapid pool of proving one\u2019\
  s self. The identity that once was a glowing torch of inspiration & purpose had\
  \ become a shackle. If I was going to \u201Cprove\u201D anything, it was that I\
  \ didn\u2019t have to stay to prove anything. But, my intention was not to prove.\
  \ My intention was to let go. I wasn\u2019t sure how I was going to get to Bali,\
  \ but about six months later on my thirtieth birthday I stepped onto that plane\
  \ and over to the other side of the world. Suffice it to say, it was a hell of a\
  \ flight."
