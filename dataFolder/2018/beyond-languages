Text: "In this part of the world the air is humid and sticky, as if something wants\
  \ to get ahold of you in a strange but pleasant manner. The swarming of Kathmandu\
  \ is tangible in the humming and buzzing coming through the walls, and I\u2019m\
  \ finally fully aware of the fact that I\u2019m here on the sacred grounds of ancient\
  \ Nepal once again. \nAs I exit the airport there\u2019s a myriad of taxis, rickshaws,\
  \ and dogs. Yet, I spot him instantly: his wide smile, lively eyes, and humble posture\
  \ give him away in the sea of people of uncountable agendas. Sherpa Kami greets\
  \ me with genuine happiness and a touch of shyness which lingers in his eyes at\
  \ all times. He welcomes me with a wreath of flowers: \xBBNamaste, Marusa. How flight,\
  \ good?\xAB \xBBNamaste, Kami. It was good, thank you. How are you?\xAB \xBBGood,\
  \ good,\xAB he says and grins \u2013 and his smile turns into a sequence of flashbacks\u2026\
  \ \nAt first I was worried about our communication, since Kami doesn\u2019t speak\
  \ or understand much English, but before I knew it, we disembarked the plane in\
  \ Lukla and started the trekking. \xBBSee, Ama Dablam. Very difficult. That Everest.\xAB\
  \ His vast knowledge of mountains isn\u2019t surprising, for he summited various\
  \ 8,000m peaks 16 times altogether, and though his job is a lifetime achievement\
  \ for most people, this makes him no less humble. He still takes every chance to\
  \ pay respect to the mountains and their deities, and that\u2019s why he taught\
  \ me how to make a puja, murmur during the process, and quietly recite prayers to\
  \ the sound of the burning bushes. A little after that he yelled: \xBBEnd mountain!\xAB\
  \ when I almost walked over the edge in the fog. He noticed it even though he was\
  \ walking behind me. \nWe laughed over it in the evening in the tiny dining room\
  \ of our lodge in Periche. We told Kami he was a friend numerous times, yet he never\
  \ sat at our table until invited. \xBBOk, ok, I coming,\xAB he said every time with\
  \ a smile of a child. He always ate dal bhat and never used silverware. His attempt\
  \ of trying to teach me how to form the liquid lentils and rice in firm lumps ended\
  \ with a spoon in my hand and Kami\u2019s unstoppable giggling about it for days.\n\
  Up until meeting him, it was impossible for me to comprehend the fact of establishing\
  \ a connection with someone strong enough to overcome language barriers. Up until\
  \ I met Kami, I thought the heart of the Himalayas lies hidden deep in the mountain\
  \ range, but Kami made me and many others realize the heart of the Himalayas lies\
  \ in the people who dedicated their lives to these mountains."
