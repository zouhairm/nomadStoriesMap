Text: "so being GAY is the worst thing that could ever happen to anyone who is living\
  \ in the middle east , imagine a decision of coming out to people in these communities\
  \ , oh no , this is indeed the most horrible idea anyone could have ever gotten\
  \ .\nas a gay person here in Yemen life is difficult , sometime i need love and\
  \ hugs Extra.\nso i have always fought that feeling of needing a guy to fill up\
  \ the space in my life and heart , just to be in the safe side right here in Yemen\
  \ \nbut as the years passed by i grew more needy , more and more \ns i reached my\
  \ twenties i decided to go out with guys and hit up on them, i showed lots of love\
  \ and affections towards cute , handsome guys \none day i met this guy(Rashid) who\
  \ made my life a living hell.\ni failed in hiding my feeling and i couldn't stop\
  \ thinking of the pleasure and love i am going to have with him OH Lord is this\
  \ really happening \ni did not believe that i am finally gonna be with someone who\
  \ understands and trust and protects me from everything and everyone \nRashed loved\
  \ me back just the way i felt for him at first sight in that crowded street.\nwe\
  \ spent good days and magnificent nights together .\nbut there was this particular\
  \ night i wont ever forget, he invited me over that night at his place his family\
  \ were traveling so he thought why not use the chance to live the night with me\
  \ , a whole night for the first time alone no one is there to interrupt or warn\
  \ us from comers.\nI was walking on the street heading to my lover's home when i\
  \ got this idea of filming the both of us while we are sleeping together.\nthe night\
  \ started with jazz music and drinks he bought secretly from his neighbor we danced\
  \ and kissed like hell then he went to the bathroom and i took the chance to put\
  \ my phone in a hidden place.\nwhen he came back we finished the night as we were\
  \ supposed to.\nnext day in the morning i left him after he made me breakfast on\
  \ bed and had shower with me.\nas i was walking to the doorsteps my father was checking\
  \ on me and asking how was my night . it was fine \" i replied\nthen he asked me\
  \ if he could call from my mobile, i searched and searched but i lost it while i\
  \ was heading home\nRashed came to my home after three hours he told me that the\
  \ guy who found the phone called him and was threatening both of us\nthat day i\
  \ had to lose both my family and Rashed\ni ran away from the death penalty\ni ran\
  \ to another city where i am working now in prostitution  .\ndo we deserve to live\
  \ \nare we all really equal \nare LGBTs humans?"
