Text: "I sat on the sidewalk with my back against a low, uneven wall and my eyes closed,\
  \ trying to get some rest before the sun rose and I had to decide whether my mission\
  \ was worth completing.\n\n\u201CAre you OK?\u201D a voice suddenly asked.\n\nI\
  \ opened my eyes. Standing over me was a Korean boy, maybe sixteen, and an older\
  \ man whom I guessed was his father. They were both decked out in full hiking gear,\
  \ a strange sight to behold on a city sidewalk. \n\nI told them I was fine, and,\
  \ gesturing toward the dark mountain looming behind them, said that I planned to\
  \ climb it at first light. The boy relayed this to his father, whom I presume spoke\
  \ no English. They conversed for a minute in rapid Korean, looking back at me in\
  \ between turns. Finally the boy swiveled back to me and said they were actually\
  \ about to climb the mountain themselves, and would I like to join them?\n\nNow\
  \ well past midnight, the mountain rose before me, a monster devouring the meager,\
  \ comforting streetlight, a great maw of unknown that seemed to grow darker and\
  \ more obscure the further up you went. I sat there weighing my options: stay here\
  \ alone on the sidewalk looking like I\u2019d had one too many bottles of Soju;\
  \ or say yes to this mysterious father-son pair who were now offering to lead me\
  \ up the very same mountain I had set out to climb.\n\nThe decision was an easy\
  \ one. This was why I had left home, to adventure into the unknown. As I followed\
  \ them up, I asked them why they had come to the mountain in the first place.\n\n\
  \u201CWe fight,\u201D the son replied. \u201CMy father and me. When we fight we\
  \ always come to mountain.\u201D\n\n\u201CEven at night? In the dark?\u201D\n\n\u201C\
  Uh-huh,\u201D he said amiably. \u201CAny problem, we bring to mountain. We leave\
  \ it here.\u201D\n\nFive hours later, as the sun began to rise over the same mountain,\
  \ the three of us sat together in a noodle shop slurping down steaming bowls of\
  \ Korean ramen in content silence. We didn\u2019t share a language, country, or\
  \ culture, and yet how trivial all of these seemed when compared with the lasting\
  \ power of experience. It was experience that had bonded us to one another, that\
  \ had delivered compassion and camaraderie. The rest was just affect, artifice,\
  \ barriers that walled us off from what was real, true, and important. \n\nI have\
  \ no idea who these strangers were, nor how many times they\u2019ve returned to\
  \ conquer that mountain. I hope not a lot. I\u2019ve never been back myself, but\
  \ I know there will be other mountains out there, piled high with the problems we\
  \ leave on them, waiting to be climbed."
