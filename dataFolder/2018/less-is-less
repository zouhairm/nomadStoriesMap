Text: "I wish I could gain a few more kilograms. I have been borderline underweight\
  \ for at least 12 years now. My mum said perhaps it was me always carrying unnecessary\
  \ loads on my backpack that affected my weight growth. I have received numerous\
  \ complaints from cloakroom attendants over my backpack.\n\nThen years later, she\
  \ changed her hypothesis to me always taking unnecessary long walks, be it to go\
  \ shopping or to go to uni. Or perhaps it was the unnecessary loads I carry during\
  \ my long walk? Either way, I have been packing less (or trying to pack less) more\
  \ often these days so that I can do even longer walks. \u201CYou just never change,\u201D\
  \ sighed my mum. Perhaps I am. I still carry a lot even when I claim that I packed\
  \ light. \n\n\u201CIt\u2019s for the wedding. I can\u2019t wear thongs to someone\u2019\
  s party,\u201D I argued.\n\n\u201CWhy don\u2019t you take taxi there?\u201D asked\
  \ my mum.\n\n\u201CAnd get stuck in Jakarta\u2019s traffic while you\u2019ll also\
  \ get stuck in the bus but for a fraction of the fare?\u201D\n\nPerhaps my mum was\
  \ right. Exhaustion soon encroached me. Was it also the tropical sun or was it the\
  \ bad pavement? Perhaps the pollution as well? But at least I have reached the Biennale,\
  \ albeit dehydrated. Well, the exhibition was air-conditioned. Partially.\n\nStill\
  \ dehydrated. And famished. And my feet were killing me. I could go for a massage\
  \ right now. But first, lunch and a nice cold drink. I couldn\u2019t care less if\
  \ the food at the exhibition\u2019s canteen were marked up. I just needed some fitful\
  \ rest.\n\nBut no, it wasn\u2019t marked up. Neither the plate of gudeg rice nor\
  \ the bottle of cold tea. It set me back a mere 20,000 rupiahs. Damn. I should go\
  \ for a second serving."
