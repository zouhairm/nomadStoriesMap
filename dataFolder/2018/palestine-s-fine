Text: "\u201CWait what? This bus is going to Palestine?\u201D\n\nRuh-roh.\n\nThe West\
  \ Bank was exactly the place I did NOT want to be going.\n\nSurprised, yet not utterly\
  \ shocked by my circumstance, I was both intrigued and a bit afraid of what was\
  \ coming next. \n\nPeople had warned me not to visit Palestine. I had been curious,\
  \ but satisfied most of that curiosity a few weeks earlier when I\u2019d volunteered\
  \ in Rotem, an Israeli \u201Ceco-village\u201D just inside the West Bank border\
  \ in the North.\n\nI hadn't crossed any military checkpoints to get into Rotem except\
  \ for at the entrance to the village. Not like this one\u2026\n\u2026this time was\
  \ different. I was definitely going to Palestine, although I had intended otherwise.\
  \ \n\nMy directions had gotten lost in translation, literally, so instead of crossing\
  \ back into Israel from the North, I was at the Allenby Bridge, the only entrance\
  \ Palestinians can use to access their own country. Oh sweet baby Jesus.\n\nRemaining\
  \ calm, I began to speak with some of the other passengers on the bus. Amongst them\
  \ was Hanan, a beautiful woman I had noticed earlier carrying a US passport. Turns\
  \ out she was on her way to Palestine to visit her parents and plant olive trees\
  \ in an act of defiance against Israeli settlers.\n\nShe invited me to come along\
  \ and, having no better alternative other than to make my way through Palestine\
  \ alone, I accepted. \n\nI was intrigued. Everything I had learned up to that point\
  \ was from the pro-Israel perspective. I had, after all, come to Israel via a program\
  \ called Birthright, which sends young Jews from all over the world to Israel for\
  \ an all-inclusive, highly insulated, 10-day bus trip to learn about Judaism. Of\
  \ my group of 40, I was one of only two people that opted to stay longer, hence\
  \ my current predicament\u2013lost and alone on a bus, accidentally heading to Palestine.\n\
  \nThrough a long journey that involved a goat boy love triangle, immortals, the\
  \ Red Sea, and then crossing into Jordan on a whim, I had somehow gotten myself\
  \ on a bus with Hanan, headed straight for Palestine.\n\nWas this a cosmic thing,\
  \ or mere coincidence? I know not, but I sure know a lot more now, having had this\
  \ experience. And what an ironic experience it was, travelling to Israel with a\
  \ Jewish group, extending my stay, getting lost, and leaving with a pro-palestinian\
  \ perspective. The experience came full circle. And I am grateful, for to leave\
  \ Israel without seeing the Wall from the other side is to leave without understanding\
  \ the country at all."
