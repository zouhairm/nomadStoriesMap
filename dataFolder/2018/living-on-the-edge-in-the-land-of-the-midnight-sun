Text: "It was April 2017 and I find myself working away on the third floor suite of\
  \ a downtown San Francisco office building overlooking the cross streets of 2nd\
  \ & Market. With less than 10 full-time employees, our startup was on a mission\
  \ to change the way Seniors \u2018Age in Place.' Then comes the dreaded news, the\
  \ most recent funding round was unsuccessful and our jobs would be terminated by\
  \ the end of the month. Fear, panic, excitement...All adjectives that describe the\
  \ feeling of \u2018Where do I go?,\u2019 \u2018What do I do next?\u2019 Being an\
  \ avid international backpacker, my mind automatically went to where I wanted to\
  \ go next. The unfamiliar lands of Scandinavia and the Baltics were calling my name.\
  \ A decision that would ultimately push me to the edge, I had no set plan, but to\
  \ reach the northernmost point of mainland Europe in Nordkapp, Norway. So I packed\
  \ up my life into a 55 liter backpack and headed off to Northern Europe for the\
  \ summer. On June 30, I crossed the Arctic Circle for the first time in Rovaniemi,\
  \ Finland, the \u201Cofficial\" hometown of Santa Claus. I met Santa Claus in the\
  \ Village, but refused to pay 30 Euros for the photo. I then hitchhiked 280 km thanks\
  \ to two very kind Finnish people and saw my first wild reindeer running across\
  \ the road. That same evening I tried my first reindeer pizza for dinner and at\
  \ 12 midnight, I watched my first beaming midnight sun, one of the most incredible\
  \ natural phenomenons, which every person should witness at least once in their\
  \ lives. The northern part of Scandinavia is home to the indigenous Sami people,\
  \ who are first known to have settled in the lands in 98 A.D. Many of the Sami people\
  \ make their living by herding reindeer. I was fortunate enough to be invited to\
  \ a Sami music festival when I crossed the Finnish border into Karasjok, Norway.\
  \ I met a group of Norwegians of Sami descent at the concert and that same evening\
  \ slept on a reindeer hide next to a river full of salmon under the midnight sun.\
  \ On July 3, I reached the North Cape at 71\xB0 N, 25\xB0 E.  Given the tilt of\
  \ the Earth's axis, the midnight sun shines here 24 hours a day from May 14 - July\
  \ 29. I took the opportunity to celebrate my accomplishment of reaching the literal\
  \ edge of this part of the world by wearing none other than my underwear and a cape.\
  \ Throughout my trip people kept asking me why I came to this remote corner of the\
  \ world, but when I crossed the Arctic Circle and basked in the glory of the midnight\
  \ sun, I had my answer. Mother nature called me here."
