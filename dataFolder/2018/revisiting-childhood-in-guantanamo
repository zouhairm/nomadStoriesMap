Text: "After two months of solo traveling across Cuba, I arrived in Guantanamo, where\
  \ I met five university students who invited me camping. Carrying our backpacks\
  \ above our heads, we tread through chest-deep rivers and cautiously waded barefoot\
  \ through swamps, trying to avoid the sharp edges of thousands of coconut shells\
  \ hidden below the surface. Mosquitoes feasted on our legs and hundreds of fallen\
  \ trees threatened our balance. After three hours of hiking under an unforgiving\
  \ Cuban sun, we set up camp on a secluded beach nestled between the wild North Atlantic\
  \ Ocean and a calm river we never learned the name of. \n\nThe black night sky hid\
  \ the growing rain clouds and before we finished our campfire pasta, a rainstorm\
  \ erupted and chased us into our canvas tent. We huddled together, laughing and\
  \ telling riddles, as water seeped in and soaked our belongings. The next morning,\
  \ we awoke to find villagers bathing and washing clothes in the river. A small woman\
  \ with a weathered face and hands showed me how to wash coconut pulp in a 60-gallon\
  \ drum before boiling it to turn it into cooking oil and skin cream. We were grateful\
  \ that her family offered to prepare breakfast, as the nearest store was 3 miles\
  \ away.\n\nThough we were excited to believe we\u2019d found a secluded section\
  \ of forest, it was far more satisfying to stumble upon a small community of friendly\
  \ faces whose children became our playmates. We drew pictures in the sand, shaved\
  \ wood for no particular reason, and built rafts of discarded bamboo, bottles, and\
  \ random objects found on the beach. After a morning of inventing, we swam across\
  \ the river to a small island that was fully submerged from the previous night\u2019\
  s rain. We chased each other through ankle-deep water, throwing mud and hiding behind\
  \ palm trees for protection. Our mud-covered bodies proved to be excellent canvases\
  \ for drawing. We played in the mud for hours, allowing our imaginations to rule,\
  \ perhaps for the first time since childhood. We fit right in with our new primary\
  \ school-aged friends.\n\nAfter a failed attempt to set up camp elsewhere in the\
  \ forest, where flooding had made trekking impossible, we returned \u201Chome\u201D\
  , where our young friends ran to greet us at the shore. They excitedly helped us\
  \ set up our tent and proudly posed for pictures next to their work. The next morning,\
  \ our adult friends arranged for a local fisherman to take us in his boat across\
  \ the flooded areas. He dropped us near a road that led to what became our next\
  \ campsite adventure."
