Text: "Soggy socks and damp underwear were the status quo.\n\nSince arriving to the\
  \ Big Island three days ago, the rain had been incessant. Sometimes it came in blithe\
  \ spurts, other times a merciless deluge. I got used to perpetually clammy hands,\
  \ but I could not forgive the weather spoiling my plans. \n\nI approached the Waipio\
  \ Valley overlook. Photos had promised dramatic cliffs towering over a black sand\
  \ beach. Today, all I saw was white. The innards of a low cloud, seemingly taunting\
  \ me. Though disappointed, I still proceeded to the beach below, descending nearly\
  \ 1,000 feet at 25% average grade. \n\nAt the valley floor, between the black sand,\
  \ gray ocean, and white fog, I swore the world turned grayscale. I tried imagining\
  \ how it would look had the day been sunny and clear, but the precipitation pushed\
  \ me back toward the trees. How long was I obligated to stay before starting the\
  \ steep hike back to the top?\n\nUnder the tree, the words of a park ranger from\
  \ earlier echoed in my ear.\n \n\u201CIn the days of their seafaring conquests,\
  \ the Polynesians did not view the ocean as a barrier. Instead, the voyagers viewed\
  \ water as a great connector, one that allowed them access to each island they discovered.\u201D\
  \ \n\nIf they saw water as a connector, why couldn\u2019t I? I had insisted on viewing\
  \ the weather as a hindrance, but I could choose to perceive it differently. The\
  \ rain and fog that I so disdained covered every surface, in a way unifying me with\
  \ my surroundings.\n\nI stepped back to the black sand, looking past the inconvenience\
  \ of the elements to experience the beauty they added.\n\nThe wet sand was so soft\
  \ beneath my feet. The roaring waves performed a symphony with the wind and showers.\
  \ The scent of seawater and fresh rain filled me. I was mesmerized by the majesty\
  \ of soaring mountains playfully peeking out from behind the fog. As raindrops continued\
  \ to tickle my face, I closed my eyes and felt my breath rise and fall with the\
  \ tide. Through water, I was aligned with this place.\n\nAfter too many minutes\
  \ had passed, I begrudgingly turned around to begin my ascent. A few steps into\
  \ the return path, I stopped abruptly. That connection was surreal, but I needed\
  \ to take it one step further. I turned around and started sprinting toward the\
  \ waves. I kicked off my shoes, then peeled off my outer layers \u2013 soggy socks,\
  \ damp underwear, and all.\n\nClothed only by fog, rain hitting every inch of my\
  \ body, I stood at the edge of the water. Laughing, I dove in."
