Text: "\u201CDo you think we should call the police?\u201D asked my friend, her face\
  \ hidden behind a cactus as I carefully swivelled round on the rubble.\n\nMy mind\
  \ flashed to dramatic TV headlines that would appear true-American style. \u2018\
  Two European girls stranded on the side of \u2018A\u2019 Mountain\u2019 it would\
  \ read. Perhaps they\u2019d have some video of our \u2018abandonment\u2019. \n\n\
  The idea had seemed harmless. The mountain didn\u2019t look high, from a distance.\
  \ However as we left the food-market - me clutching my bag of Tucson-style tamales\
  \ - and headed towards the Arizonan \u2018A\u2019 at the top, our heads titled as\
  \ the peak rose.\n\nFirst, we looked for a road. We knew there was one. Some other\
  \ exchange students had already visited and we\u2019d heard of romantic trips being\
  \ taken to the summit, watching the orange/grey sprawl of the desert/city mix below.\
  \ \n\nBut we couldn\u2019t find a road. \n\n\u201CWe\u2019ll just go straight up.\
  \ It doesn\u2019t look too steep.\u201D\n\nOur first few steps were innocent as\
  \ we followed a make-shift dirt track. But the ground soon turned unstable and stones\
  \ rolled down the side, smashing beneath our flimsy pumps. With my free hand, I\
  \ grabbed onto cacti tentatively, squealing when a prickle cut my palm.\n\n\u201C\
  We can\u2019t go down,\u201D I said when we were about halfway. \u201CIt\u2019s\
  \ more dangerous if we fall. We have to keep going.\u201D\n\nIt was then my friend\
  \ suggested the police. For a second I was tempted, but I shook my head and told\
  \ her of my vision of embarrassment. She agreed. We couldn\u2019t be \u2018those\
  \ European girls who got stuck up \u2018A\u2019 Mountain\u2019. \n\nSoon enough,\
  \ we discovered the road and quickly realised why we had not found the base. Contrary\
  \ to our previous belief, the grey tarmac wound around the mountain like an elegant\
  \ snake. It did not scale hap-hazardously straight to the top as we had attempted\
  \ to. \n\nWe hopped over the metal bar, which finally meant placing my tamales on\
  \ the floor. Two young locals in baseball caps standing next to their low-riders\
  \ looked at us, bemused. We had quite literally emerged from the cacti and dirt.\n\
  \nYet below us, the sun was drifting away and the city began to light up. There\
  \ still were glimpses of purple on the tips of the mountain range that lovingly\
  \ cradles Tucson. \n\nHowever, we still weren\u2019t there yet: cars whizzed past\
  \ us, heading further to the top. \n\nMy friend and I looked at each other, exhausted\
  \ yet relieved. We shivered as the cool late-October air hit us. The ground, which\
  \ had seemed fearful throughout our ascent, suddenly looked inviting. Our stomachs\
  \ growled.\n\n\u201CLet\u2019s go get tacos.\u201D"
