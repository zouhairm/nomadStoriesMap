Text: "The woman towered over the andean shopkeep and shouted at him, in english,\
  \ for not having any vegan bread. Only 20 minutes later she demanded a pit stop.\
  \ Twenty eight tourists patiently waited on the bus while mother and daughter squatted\
  \ side y side and urinated in unison in plain sight.\n\nThe track was barely wide\
  \ enough for our gargantuan school bus. We crawled up the side of the mountain,\
  \ bald tires drifting and occasionally protruding into vertical nothingness. The\
  \ road crumbled before my eyes as the weight of the bus broke off a chunk of dirt\
  \ and flung it down into the abyss. The unconcerned hippies continued eating their\
  \ bananas.\n\nWe parked at the base of the  run-down chairlift and received stern\
  \ warnings from our otherwise effeminate guide. Despite our best unified efforts\
  \ to coerce them into compliance, the beatniks turned their backs and wandered aimlessly\
  \ into the high altitude desert valley. Juan, our guide, yelled at them as they\
  \ were walking away: \u201CWe leave at 12:30 sharp, or sooner if it starts to snow\u201D\
  . As he delivered these final words a heavy black cloud swooped in and dimmed the\
  \ sunlight enough to produce a mortiferous grey hue. The pair skipped out of sight\
  \ in their loose fitting tie-dye garments and velcro sandals.  \n\nIt was freezing\
  \ on the summit. Winds picked up and visibility went to hell in the blink of an\
  \ eye. The storm hit the ridge like a punch in the face. \nChema, the driver, already\
  \ had the engine running when we returned. Just as he went to put the bus into gear,\
  \ Juan told him to wait. There were two missing passengers. \n\nIt was 12:13 and\
  \ the blizzard shook the bus like a dry leaf. I could see about an inch of snow\
  \ on the ground already. Chema buried his face in his hands. Juan was in tears.\n\
  \nAfter ten minutes of honking and flashing the lights, Chema spoke out: \n\n\u201C\
  Tenemos que irnos inmediatamente, o nos vamos todos pa\u2019 la mierda.\u201D\n\n\
  I looked Juan in his convoluted brown eyes and said:\n\n \u201CYou warned us all.\
  \ They disobeyed. It's been snowing for 30 minutes. If we keep waiting for them,\
  \ their selfishness could get us all killed.\u201D\n\nSilence. \n\nI stood and addressed\
  \ the entire bus: \n\n\u201CIf we wait, the whole bus could slide off the cliff\
  \ on the way down. If we leave now, they could die.\u201D\n\nSilence. \n\n12:29\n\
  \nI stood again.\n\n\u201CIf any of you are against leaving right now, speak up.\u201D\
  \n\nThe wind hissed through the cracked window frames and rattled the bus. The gearbox\
  \ clanked and we inched towards the most emotional bus ride of our lives."
