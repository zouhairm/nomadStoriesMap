Text: "During summer 2014, I took part of an anthropologic and sociologic workshop\
  \ at the Keystone Foundation in Tamil Nadu, India. We were a group of 14 people\
  \ and we had to analyze the transfer of knowledges on the activity of the honey\
  \ hunting. I remember the first time that we arrived in the two villages in which\
  \ we had to do the research: we were all happy and excited to be in India, all the\
  \ colors, all the persons around us, everything was perfect, everything that was\
  \ completely different from our culture and everything was the perfect scenario\
  \ for a picture. \nThat day, after the visit of the two villages, we came home and\
  \ we started an exercise in which we had to talk about all the feelings of the day\
  \ and we had to show our pictures to the group. I remember that most of the pictures\
  \ were similar and that the reasons why those pictures were taken was that \nwe\
  \ were surprised to see all the local life, all the different habits that Indian\
  \ people have compared to us.\nAfter that exercise, we understood that those pictures\
  \ were the touristic pictures because when you arrive in a new place, a new city,\
  \ a new country, you have to open your eyes and to forget about the camera. You\
  \ need to live the reality, to connect with local people, to see how they live and\
  \ to start to see the details of their life because those details are the correct\
  \ informations to explain in a picture. Since that day, we forgot about our cameras\
  \ and we started to focus on the people, from the group of \"white tourists with\
  \ camera\" we became Lucrezia, Giulio, Niccol\xF2, everyone with its own name, everyone\
  \ ready to tell its own story, its own reality and to share a piece of our lives\
  \ with the local people. I think that this experience taught me how important it\
  \ is to make a connection with local people, because only if you do that connection\
  \ you will be able to say that you are a real traveler and that you have lived a\
  \ travel and all the memories of it."
