Text: "One year, one ticket, one way: South East Asia.\nI fell asleep in a random\
  \ hostel room, alone, surrounded by white walls and empty bedrooms. I woke up in\
  \ the middle of the night, starving and, in one hour, my bed was full of foods and\
  \ discarded cards. I was in Singapore and, for the first time, I was afraid.\nPanic\
  \ wasn\u2019t on my list. I yelled myself and, in less than an hour, I decided what\
  \ I had to do in the next two weeks. That was a bad move! I planned every second\
  \ of my time in Singapore and I erased any possibility to discover that land day\
  \ by day. Soon I got bored. I run away and never think twice.\nThat morning I bought\
  \ a bus ticket. Next stop: Kuala Lumpur.\nMalaysia is one of those countries that\
  \ amazes and hits you straight to the heart. It\u2019s like opening a window and\
  \ looking out to customs, cultures, colors and flavors. Malays, Chinese and Indians\
  \ seem to coexist peacefully in this country but, if you look at them carefully,\
  \ you\u2019ll notice that the different ethnic groups rarely mingle one to each\
  \ other. Everyone, in their neighborhood, lives according to their customs and traditions,\
  \ with their own clothes and their typical homes. Along the streets, you can meet\
  \ Muslim women with veil, Indians with turban and Turkish who smoke, Europeans in\
  \ suits and ties and bystanders that spit out. I was looking at this go away of\
  \ people, when I met Mun for the first time, an incredible  Malay boy who showed\
  \ me the best of Malaysia.\nIt was my last night in Kuala Lumpur when Mun decided\
  \ to bring me to Kuala Selangor and see fireflies along the river.\nIn a typical\
  \ Malaysian wooden boat, we slipped on the river. The atmosphere was quit, we could\
  \ listen catchy songs in the background while we were rocked by the boat. I was\
  \ happy. It gets dark slowly and the boat was still moving to the beat, approaching\
  \ to the trees and getting away by the current. My eyes were charmed, enlightened\
  \ by the thousand fireflies. The kid next to me whispered \xABkelip-kelip\xBB and\
  \ Mun explained me the meaning. In Malaysia they called fireflies like that because\
  \ they shine with spectacular synchronized shimmers.\nTen minutes later, we were\
  \ on dry land, running left and right with the purpose to catch that bright spots.\
  \ I can\u2019t, but Mun can. I was curious, I walked near and got closed to his\
  \ hand. Bit by bit, Mun opened his hands to let me see, but they fly away, far from\
  \ us.\nI woke up. It was just another dream, but no one has told me it\u2019s impossible."
