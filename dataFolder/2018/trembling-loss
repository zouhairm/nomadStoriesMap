Text: "\u201CIt all came crumbling down right in front of my eyes!\u201D Samuba adjusting\
  \ her stained eyeglasses and continued weaving \u2013 a tale or a cloth? I was not\
  \ sure, but I knew I had to listen. She sat on the mud patio of her recently built\
  \ bhungo \u2013 a traditional cylindrical mud house which is commonly found in the\
  \ desert district of Kutch in Gujarat, India. Her wrinkled skin and tired eyes screamed\
  \ stories of the life she had braved. The trembling of her hands deterred not her\
  \ spirit to work for the craftsmanship she had inherited.  \u201CAs usual I had\
  \ woken up early on that winter morning. The sun still peeping from the horizon\
  \ while the moon was stationed adamantly owing the sky. The damp air hit my headscarf\
  \ as I walked through the village lanes to reach the warehouse to supply my assignment\
  \ of the previous day.\u201D The shaking patio startled me; I looked around, a loaded\
  \ truck was speeding through the main road. Unaffected by the tremors, she went\
  \ on \u201CAs I reached the warehouse, I felt movement beneath my feet, ignoring\
  \ it for my cramping ankles, I climbed the stairs. The warehouse started swaying\
  \ and I did too. The doors to the warehouse opened and people ran out screaming.\u201D\
  \ Screaming children ran past us. \u201CI was pushed out by the stream of people\
  \ running out of the warehouse. I heard shaking screams and panicked voices of concern.\
  \  I was aware something was wrong and my reflexes knew where they were taking me.\u201D\
  \ A hot wave of air manages to cool the droplets of sweat trickling down my back,\
  \ \u201CAs I reached my lane, I saw nothing but rubble.\u201D The swiftly passing\
  \ bike left behind a tornado of dust that engulfed us, the dust seeped deep into\
  \ my lungs leaving my throat dry and gasping for breath. \u201CMy sight was blurring\
  \ with dust. I was dependent on my instincts. I managed to find my rubble from that\
  \ of the village. Nothing was left. Against consciousness, I began picking up the\
  \ chunks of my house, or at least whatever was left of it. The earthquake swallowed\
  \ them all.\u201D A silent tear trickles down her eyes, but she continues weaving.\
  \ I bought a bunch of beautiful handcrafted pieces from Samuba. As I got up to leave\
  \ she went inside her house and fetched back a bright orange sling bag with intricate\
  \ embroidery and mirror work and placed it in my hand, \u201CI made this for my\
  \ granddaughter!\u201D I bid her a teary farewell and she waved back with a shining\
  \ smile. I came here in search of a handicraft village that was re-built after the\
  \ earthquake; all I take back is a reason to return."
