Text: "\u201CIsn\u2019t this neighborhood known for it\u2019s Armenian food?\u201D\
  . After witnessing our friend get a commemorative tattoo in soft Arabic calligraphy\
  \ rendering the colloquial word \u201Cshuroosh\u201D (Lebanese dialect for \u201C\
  rooted\u201D), our rumbling stomachs planted us back in reality. All three of our\
  \ phones dead after a confusing Uber drop off at a butcher shop where the tattoo\
  \ studio should have been, a quest presented itself. Winding our way through narrow\
  \ Beirut streets lined with brightly colored apartment buildings, our adventure\
  \ to find this instagram-famous tattoo artist began. \n\nLuckily for us, Lebanese\
  \ culture is steeping in hospitality, so find him we did. Walking out with fresh\
  \ ink on a foot canvas, we let our appetites do the deciding on where to go next.\
  \ With the modern day explorer's compass (otherwise known as Google) out of juice,\
  \ we followed our noses to a tucked away alley housing a restaurant.  Opening solid\
  \ wooden doors tentatively, we asked in broken Arabic if they had our collective\
  \ favorite dish, manti. With an amused grin, the sweet matron smiled and said, \u201C\
  Yes, of course! You are most welcome\" as she led us to a table down the narrow\
  \ hallway-sized space. \n\nUnbeknownst to us, this night was a special heritage\
  \ evening. Hungrily we ordered the light dumplings. The tables surrounding us filled\
  \ up with multi-generational Armenian families waiting for the show to begin. A\
  \ tearful introduction in Armenian ushered in the first act: an opera singer and\
  \ classical pianists who delighted and excited. Followed by a guitarist, who walked\
  \ around serenading all in traditional melodies. The final act was a scene enacted\
  \ by a beautifully sad woman who must have been around 80, clothed in heavy black\
  \ from head to toe. After an uncomfortable pause, she chillingly recited from memory\
  \ a poem written decades ago. I did not understand a single syllable, but I could\
  \ tell from the raw emotions she effortlessly conveyed that she was speaking of,\
  \ remembering, war. \n\nNever would I have expected that a supposed quick adventure\
  \ to watch my friend get a life-chapter tattoo would have led to this. To feel the\
  \ raw emotional turmoil of war and conflict through this woman, all without a single\
  \ word understood. How deeply rooted in the human experience must our emotions be.\
  \ This experience was so different than anything I've ever felt through a textbook\
  \ or museum and yet it beckoned me with a deep desire to learn more and to humbly\
  \ explore the complex world beyond the little I know."
