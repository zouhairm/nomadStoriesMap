  call: -Hello is the vet?-Hi the vet here-Ayyrrrrrrrr,I had a cow with a bed out!!!-Sorry?-Ayrrrrrr.could
  you come?

  -Whats the problem?-what a fuck?come quick...I have bed out in one of my cows-Excuse
  me?what is the problem you got ?-What sort of vet are you? bed outtttttttttt,-All
  right I will be there in 30 minutes.I was driving to the farm without Idea what
  happen,bed out?,maybe the farmer decided to sleep away in his bed....or had a cow
  that was sleeping in a bed or bloody hell!!!!no idea,-Hello Mr lyon-thought never
  going to come,ayrrrr-Whats the problem?-dont have eyes?That cow overthere,bloody
  hell!!!bed out mean uterus prolapse!!!!I managed to resolved the problem and the
  cow look like to be all right with her bed "in " again

  -Ok Mr lyon I leave you some medication-no so fast vet!-Sorry-I have a sow that
  is very hot and running nose could you give something to her?

  I went to a smal pigs tent with 4 pigs inside,was all muddy inside,one of the pig
  was lie down with Pneumonia symptoms,I have to inject to her some Amoxiciline but,oh
  my god!!!!,was not easy.the other pigs starting moving and crying,the noise was
  terrible..-oinkkkkk,oinkkkkk,....louder and louder..

  When I tried to inject the pig .She bite me in the nose,...ahhhh...very painful...finally
  I could inject the medicine and I run away covered in shit and blood from my nose-Ok
  Mr Lyon is done -(Mr lyon was smiling for the first time),He was hilarious to see
  me bleeding and with mud in all my body!!!!!

  When I arrived home,was raining,oh my god!!incredible,,,,very heavy raining ..but
  finally I was at home!!

  When I went to remove my clothes I realise that the nightmare was unfinished....I
  lost my wallet in the pig house!!!!!Noooooooooooo!!!!!

  I had to return to the farm-Mr Lyon, I am sorry,I think my wallet fall over in the
  pig house ,do you mind if I try to find it

  Mr Lyon start laughing and laughing-of course..of course...You can go

  Bloody hell,was raining even more  but finally in the entrance of the pig house
  I could see my wallet floating on a pile of pig faeces

  After all this Mr Lyon invite me to a lovely hot soup and became in the first of
  many friends and He recommend me to many other farmer around the area

  I was a hard time In Scotland but local people after not very easy start made me
  feel like at home,I always will have very good ,amazing and unforgeteable memories
  about my time working in Scotland'
