Text: "We boarded the plane Moscow \u2013 Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy on 5 august 2016.\
  \ Kamchatka peninsula is half-a-wall by map, 9 hours\u2019 time difference, more\
  \ than 7 thousand kilometers away from home. Couldn\u2019t explain this, but when\
  \ I saw that snow-covered peaks of Cherskogo Range below plane and crimson sunrise\
  \ of new day, I started physically feel that huge distance between me and my home.\
  \ \nWe were going to the one of the greatest adventures in our life \u2013 the 2\
  \ weeks hiking in Kamchatka. Surrounded by stunning young volcanoes, we went through\
  \ the mountain passes folded of rocks with color of a guitar deck. We used to live\
  \ with wild bears walking not far from our camp, to drink the clearest water from\
  \ glacier rivers and to chill in thermal springs under the stars.  But this story\
  \ is about something more. \nOur hiking trip was over and all my friends came back\
  \ to Moscow. But I had a dream to surf in Pacific Ocean, one of the marvelous surfing\
  \ places in Russia. \nI was going with the map from the last village to the Halactyrka\
  \ Beach, when I realized that on this way we\u2019d seen the small bear yesterday.\
  \ This awareness was really scary, because I was absolutely alone. The biggest part\
  \ of pathway was done and I decided to end it as fast as I can. In several kilometers\
  \ I entered the main road, and saw the surf school, then the true local surfers\
  \ and the immense Pacific Ocean! After all, I felt relieved and calm. The waves\
  \ were too huge for newbie and I was just sitting in front of ocean for maybe two\
  \ hours or more. The plan was to surf there for couple of days and come back to\
  \ the city to buy some souvenirs. My foot! I\u2019d met a lot of new people during\
  \ my first evening fire on Halaktyrka: Anton \u2013 the founder of surf school,\
  \ Daria and Kristina \u2013 the local girls, Anya, Daria, Max, and Katya, who live\
  \ on the beach and goes home only for some strong reasons! We surfed all together,\
  \ then spent the nights under the brightest Milky Way I\u2019ve ever seen, sang\
  \ songs, talking about all the sand in all the sea. The atmosphere was so special;\
  \ I was so happy being by the Ocean with my new friends. \nDuring my last night\
  \ before flight we careered about in city, watched movies about Kamchatka and came\
  \ back to the Ocean in the end. There are no two similar waves, but this story is\
  \ about something more. This story is about my new home with native souls in 7 thousand\
  \ kilometers away, and I\u2019ll come back \u2013 the clouds this summer will be\
  \ especially great!"
