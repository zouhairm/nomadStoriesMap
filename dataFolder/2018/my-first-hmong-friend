Text: "Cho Cho\u2019s shack sits on the steepest, highest spot on Muong Hoa Valley\u2019\
  s mountainside, gazing down a sea of glowing rice terraces and waves of fog restlessly\
  \ washing ashore. Despite the golden view, her home is humble. An open fire, a dwarf\
  \ table, two bottom-naked grandsons groveling on patchy cement floor, deflated air\
  \ mattresses and Lulu, a black labrador.\n\nIn the touristy Ta Van village of Sa\
  \ Pa, a northern district that welcomes a few hundred thousand foreigners and over\
  \ a million Viet nationals every year, the Hmong homestay hasn\u2019t hosted a single\
  \ Vietnamese. \n\n\u2018Are you Vietnamese?\u2019 Chubby 50-year-old Cho Cho eyed\
  \ me curiously and asked in English. In her ten years as a local host and trekking\
  \ guide, I would be the first Viet to stay over at her house. \n\n\u2018Vang a,\u201D\
  \ I replied in Vietnamese, meaning a polite yes. \n\nThat night, we drank two beers\
  \ each, emptied two plates of stir-fried potatoes with smoked pork, and learned\
  \ to read the Bible in Hmong chalked on her wall. Cho Cho, struggled to find words\
  \ in our national language, had comfortably slid to her broken English. By the end\
  \ of our jovial dinner, she burst into tears of laughter. \n\n\u2018Vietnamese tourists\
  \ often point at me and say, \u2018you\u2019re crazy, stupid Hmong woman\u2019,\u201D\
  \ she instantly stood up and did a mini solo skit. \n\n\u2018Ok! I nodded and pretended\
  \ to be stupid,\u201D she pinched her nose, wiggled her head and pointed at herself.\n\
  \nI felt numb. I laughed along with guilt filled inside my chest. Growing up, discriminatory\
  \ conversations have not been rare among my Vietnamese friends and family. The Miao,\
  \ a derogatory term for Hmong, as my parents often says, are dirty. On social media\
  \ and national newspapers, the Hmong are poor, uneducated, and only given attention\
  \ when it comes to exotic mountainous life, or under criticism for their backwards\
  \ traditions like wife kidnapping. \n\n\u201CThey never stay at my house because\
  \ they said it\u2019s too Hmong and too dirty,\u201D Cho Cho concluded, still panting\
  \ from too much laughing.  \n\nThe next morning, I watched fog washing up and clear\
  \ themselves, revealing busy lines of tourist coaches trailing from luxury hotels\
  \ atop of the valley, stumbling past the gravel pass to Ta Van village in search\
  \ of authentic experience. Cho Cho woke up early to trek with her foreign customers,\
  \ as usual. There would be no Vietnamese. \n\nBefore we depart, Cho Cho hugged me,\
  \ patted my back and uttered in English.\n\n\"Next time you come here, you don\u2019\
  t have to pay. You\u2019re my friends now.\""
