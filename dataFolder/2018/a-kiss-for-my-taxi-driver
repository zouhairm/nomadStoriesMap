Text: "The cold travelling through my nostrils was exterminated at the sip of the\
  \ hot peppermint tea that almost spilled on my hotel bedside table. I glanced at\
  \ my watch and figured that my editor whose room was two floors away from mine should\
  \ be awake. I decided to send messages to him about my planned visit to the Nelson\
  \ Mandela Museum of Contemporary Art in Johannesburg that morning. He responded\
  \ that he wasn't going out at all. I needed his company or any company for that\
  \ matter. This is a city I didn't quite prepare to visit. I thought I did, having\
  \ shopped for winter gloves, jackets and socks. But I should have known that my\
  \ local network would only work if I had roamed. I thought roaming was expensive\
  \ until I arrived in Jo'burg and discovered that some adventure can be more costly.\
  \ As I set out of my room, my editor, Davidson called me to say he had changed his\
  \ mind. I was excited. I enjoyed his company because he would pay the taxi fares\
  \ and buy some lunch. I thought I should surprise him by taking the initiative this\
  \ time. It was supposed to be a good idea.\nThe taxi driver arrived and he was quite\
  \ pleasant. He offered nice comments as we moved past withering trees along the\
  \ Johannesburg Central district. I was still finding it hard to adjust to his right-hand\
  \ driving as he breezed past the curves and sharp edges cautiously. I glanced at\
  \ my editor as he was comparing the sight with what we left behind in my home country.\
  \ \nAs we arrived at the famous museum, I saw Davidson reaching out for his purse;\
  \ I stopped him and paid the fares. It was a good feeling to reciprocate generosity.\
  \ That was shortlived. As soon as the taxi zoomed off, Davidson couldn't find his\
  \ phone. He mistakenly dropped it on the back seat. I was helpless as I couldn't\
  \ call with my Nigerian line.\nDavidson was furious at me for making him come out\
  \ that morning and for not roaming or even securing a local line on arrival. I begged\
  \ him to board a commercial bus with me as most of the cabs along the road were\
  \ pre-booked. He was mad at me for making him board a bus whereby only one man understood\
  \ English laced with Nigerian accent. We returned to the hotel and I went straight\
  \ to the receptionist who had called the cab for us. She located the driver with\
  \ the mobile app. In about twenty minutes, the taxi driver arrived with Davidson's\
  \ phone. I hugged the taxi driver and I could have kissed him in the height of my\
  \ emotional response. I was relieved. Davidson said we could go back to the museum."
