Text: "In winters 2018 I was travelling solo in India (Uttar pradesh).\nVaranasi is\
  \ popularly known as land of Ghats (area near river) with staircase and temples\
  \ around.people there were diving  in the river, locals were guiding foreigners\
  \ troop, priests were doing the ceremony for which people were gatthered there.\n\
  It was a place where you can see orangish colour of the river as when sun rises,\
  \ the reflection directly comes through the river and the evenings were just amazing,\
  \ the priests were offering their rituals with all handmade lamps and their staircases\
  \ were lightened up with the lamps chanting the mantras, with the crowd of thousands\
  \ of locals and tourist.\nBut te think that was in common with everyone was their\
  \ dressing almost everyone was wearing the colour orange the priests were naked\
  \ on the top and wearing dhoti coloured orange.\nThere were shops around selling\
  \ things required in the ceremony held by the priests, selling flowers, sweets,\
  \ fruits, and majorly orange colour dhoti.\nWhen I had word with some of the priest\
  \ their about the tradition of wearing colour orange at the time of offering their\
  \ faith in God, the n I was surprised to here this\nThe word dhoti is derived from\
  \ dhauti (Sanskrit: \u0927\u094C\u0924\u0940), meaning to cleanse or wash. In the\
  \ context of clothing, it simply refers to the cleansed garment which was worn during\
  \ shrauta sacrifices or religious sessions in general. The dhoti evolved from the\
  \ ancient antriya which was passed through the legs, tucked at the back and covered\
  \ the legs loosely, then flowed into long pleats at front of the legs, the same\
  \ way it is worn today.\nIt is the national dress of the Madhesh region of southern\
  \ Nepal, worn mainly by Nepalis of Madhesi, Tharu and Maithali ethnicity.\nHare\
  \ Krishna, known for its distinctive dress code, prompts Western adherents to wear\
  \ pancha, usually of saffron or white cloth folded in a traditional style. Mahatma\
  \ Gandhi invariably wore a pancha on public occasions[citation needed] but, as he\
  \ was aware that it was considered \"indecent\" to do so in other countries, was\
  \ shocked when a friend wore one in London. Maharishi Mahesh Yogi was known for\
  \ wearing a white silk dhoti."
