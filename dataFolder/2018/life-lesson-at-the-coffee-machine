Text: "Dan picks me up 4:15 a.m. If he's tired I can't see it. He is quiet, we barely\
  \ know each other, but it\u2019s the silence that you reach when you are at ease\
  \ with someone. This also silences my conscience, which didn\u2019t want me to go\
  \ one week in Iceland with three unknown guys. The scale starts to hang on the side\
  \ of excitement and the heavier plate of morality, continues to rise. In a few hours\
  \ that light, vaporous plate of excitement would have challenged the laws of physics\
  \ and touched the ground in unison with the thud of the plane on Icelandic land.\
  \ When we arrive, it\u2019s already late in the afternoon, the wait for the hire\
  \ is endless but my mates don\u2019t mind, they are craving to drive a giant off-road\
  \ in a snowy desert. For me the car is just something to arrive somewhere, it\u2019\
  s not a priority as it seems to be for them. I hate driving, I think that concentrating\
  \ on the road and other cars is a waste of time, especially when outside there is\
  \ a world to see. I drove on the highway just one time, at nineteen, with my terrified\
  \ mum next to me. Now, I am the only 25-years old in the group, the minimum age\
  \ to drive an off-road in this Country. I will be the first one driving this enormous\
  \ car, in Iceland, in highway, with snow and wind outside. And three unknown passengers\
  \ with me. At the beginning they don\u2019t speak, music is off. There aren\u2019\
  t many other cars, the landscape is beautiful and I start feeling part of it. It\
  \ wraps me, moving but remaining the same, coherent, pure, without any harsh breaks.\
  \ This car is making me going to the heart of that endless land and I begin to understand\
  \ the essence of Iceland: the journey, the roads, , the infinite distances, the\
  \ landscapes between one place and another. Not a building, not a destination. If\
  \ you don\u2019t pay attention on the road, you are not understanding this land.\
  \ Now I know that Iceland represents life, where the so-called future is never reached.\
  \ We could make plans, put some stakes on the path, but we will discover other ways,\
  \ or stakes will be exceeded, leaving space to the unknown. And a snow storm could\
  \ occur in every moment. An off-road is essential in this Country and my travel\
  \ friends were giving me a life lesson, drinking a watery coffee in the car rent.\
  \ Dan looks at me through the rearview mirror. He is smiling. He tells Dave to turn\
  \ on the music and I drive for about one hour. Behind me the fear of driving. Ahead,\
  \ the adventure."
