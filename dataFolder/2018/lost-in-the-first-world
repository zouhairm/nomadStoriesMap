Text: "A humid shuttle ride transporting us on a bumpy dirt road, undeveloped land,\
  \ truly rural habitat. Homes, smaller than corner stores. Hammocks, clothing \u2013\
  \ presumably women\u2019s apparel, not too far from their homes. Exposed shops on\
  \ the sides of the road \u2013 publicly advertised for consumers driving by. Tourists.\
  \ Us, me. Is this how natives live in Costa Rica?\n\nApproaching the sister hotel\
  \ of our resort, it reminded me of the Taj Mahal, at least from what I\u2019ve seen\
  \ online. Our hotel, massive, grand but old fashioned, full of activities, yet still\
  \ we felt isolated from the outside world. Relaxing on the black sand beach formed\
  \ from volcano debris, \u201CWhat more does your town have to offer?\u201D I ask\
  \ the locals. They explain, Costa Rica is about the lifestyle you live. Being happy\
  \ in its simplicity. Yet I still urged for more, \u201CWhere is the tropical paradise?\u201D\
  \ We\u2019re lead to their definition of that...\n\nCoco Beach, not exactly the\
  \ textbook definition of quaint, but certainly filled with a unique charm of its\
  \ own. Bars, restaurants and shops filling the strip on both sides of the road.\
  \ Fruit stands. Our stomachs called to us\u2026 I snuck a few art-deco photos while\
  \ making my way to the restroom. But this strip too was quiet, unpopulated. Why?\
  \ A downpour heavy enough for a flood warning, assuming the country was not ergonomically\
  \ designed for this. We survive, we shop. Scouring every garment for colorful freeform\
  \ dresses, floral prints, elephant patterns. We stumbled across a dive bar, ordered\
  \ one too many Chili Guaros. Ordered tacos. These were no ordinary Tacos. I\u2019\
  m talking authentic tacos, freshly made, fried to perfection, flavorful beyond imagination.\
  \ And now, I can no longer eat tacos in the states\u2026 that good. \n\nFinally\
  \ surrendering to the ideals of the locals... What seemingly was a third world country\
  \ in my eyes, is in fact paradise. Becoming one with nature, relaxation, a free\
  \ open world, we barely scratched the surface. I thought traveling was about exploring\
  \ exotic places filled with waterfalls and palm trees as depicted in media, visiting\
  \ bigger cities, staying connected. I\u2019ve learned to appreciate rural communities\
  \ and nature, now open to the idea of backpacking. Because we get so caught up in\
  \ our lives, consumerism, hustle & bustle. Money. Proving instead of living. We\
  \ think we need these things, we\u2019re blinded by the bright lights. Lost. But\
  \ in Costa Rica, they are proud of their country, unconcerned with what they do\
  \ not have. And this is real, pure life."
