Text: "Graduation day is amazing; the people you love surround you and support you,\
  \ you are ready to show them and to your professors how hard you worked during the\
  \ last five years, writing your final project. You show them and yourself that you\
  \ are worth the highest grade, the honours, the congratulations, and most of all\
  \ the happiness.\nYou spend twenty years of your life learning, accumulating knowledge\
  \ and experiences, developing your skills, enriching your culture and improving\
  \ yourself both personally and professionally. You work hard, you are committed,\
  \ concentrated, passionate and most of all hopeful. You have enormous expectations\
  \ from the future because you worked hard to get the best from you and as a brilliant\
  \ graduate you want life to give you the best in return. \nAfter my graduation,\
  \ people were proud of me and used to tell me that with my mind and my positive\
  \ attitude, I would have found a job in no time. Therefore, my already-big expectations\
  \ grew up like a forest.\nI was happy and frightened by my next steps, but I had\
  \ not considered the country I was living in. Italy is beautiful, full of art and\
  \ good food, fun people. I love my nation, but looking for a job is not that easy:\
  \ you need to be young, with at least a couple of degrees, and never forget you\
  \ must have a year of experience (if not more). \nNow, if you have every characteristic\
  \ I just mentioned, then you are the perfect candidate for\u2026 an amazing internship.\
  \ If you are lucky you may have a chance to get hired after this stage, otherwise,\
  \ you go on with another apprenticeship until you either find the job of your life,\
  \ or you come back home and cry in your parents arms.\nIf you look for more, though,\
  \ and you should do it because you deserve better, then you start considering the\
  \ rest of the world. I did it; I was unhappy, stressed, I felt like I was falling\
  \ apart under the pressure of rejection, and I began looking abroad. I applied for\
  \ a job, I had a couple of interviews and after that, I was on a plane for Budapest\
  \ for the last contact. \nJob search and exasperation were the fuel of my engine,\
  \ they pushed me to leave Italy and I found an incredible city waiting for me, wanting\
  \ me.\nI discovered that we can accept all the rage and frustration and transform\
  \ these into a positive attitude: a drive to improve ourselves and face the challenges\
  \ we never thought about. The criticalities of my country enabled me to find new\
  \ places, a new self-consciousness in a journey both physical and spiritual."
