Text: "When I was fifteen, I lived and went to High School in Sofia, Bulgaria. My\
  \ class and I were taken on a week-long retreat which included visits to multiple\
  \ local cities in Bulgaria to take part in various activities and also give back\
  \ to those communities. At one local area, we were given the opportunity to decorate\
  \ the town\u2019s main church. As I was decorating a tree, a local man stood at\
  \ the gate next to it and started talking to me in Bulgarian, which I do not know\
  \ how to speak, but I have a basic understanding of. So he started saying different\
  \ country names and I understood that he wanted to know where I am from. I replied\
  \ \u201CEgypt\u201D in Bulgarian, to which he replied \u201CMuslim?\u201D I do not\
  \ wear a head-scarf, so I answered back \u201CYes,\u201D in Bulgarian and I continued\
  \ to decorate the tree. Out of nowhere, I found ten people standing behind the gate\
  \ smiling and cheering me on. As we left, they were all waving to me, smiling, and\
  \ saying encouraging words in Bulgarian. My classmates were confused and one of\
  \ my teachers even asked me what was going on, to which I replied, \u201CNothing,\
  \ they just found out that I\u2019m from Egypt and a Muslim, and I think I might\
  \ have changed whatever impression they had all those years for the better.\u201D\
  \ \n Ever since, every country I visit, I always have the intention of being who\
  \ I am without altering myself based on the conditions that I face. I know that\
  \ people\u2019s views are based on the experiences that they have been through,\
  \ and whatever information they hear about from different sources. So, I always\
  \ accept that there are differences in points of views, but I make it my mission\
  \ to leave people feeling good about themselves, and I try my best to relate to\
  \ their cultures and I push myself to try to speak the language of the country that\
  \ I\u2019m visiting at the time. Even if I make mistakes in pronunciations, I always\
  \ see a spark in the eyes of locals when they realize that I am making an effort\
  \ to connect with them, and that means the world to me. I feel that every person\
  \ alive has a purpose for still being here that they must figure out, pursue, and\
  \ use every chance they get to fulfill that purpose for the rest of their lives.\
  \ But, the one reason that we all share is making a connection with others. I want\
  \ to have exciting stories to tell when I am old and grey. I want to feel like I\
  \ lived my life to the fullest and that I am using this chance, the chance that\
  \ I am alive, to make an impact and to leave my footprints in the world."
