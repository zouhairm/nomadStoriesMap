Text: "After 3 months of traveling north to find a \"medicine man\" as [email\_protected]*#\
  \ It so aptly refereed to him, we were trekking west down the vacant center of the\
  \ mid-Washington plains. Hitchhiking down the the #2 federal highway, Airplane,\
  \ [email\_protected]*# It, and myself were happy to catch a ride.  \n\n[email\_\
  protected]*# It as he called himself, had felt compelled to come to America from\
  \ New Zealand to find a medicine man, ever since he had been diagnosed with a brain\
  \ tumor. I met [email\_protected]*# It and Airplane the moment I started north on\
  \ the 101 from Malibu, where my father had dropped me off. [email\_protected]*#\
  \ It rolled up behind me on his skateboard and in his lackadaisical manner, asked\
  \ me where I was going. \n\nHe looked like someone that had spent his life on the\
  \ beach, a friendly demeanor. I simply replied \"North\". \n\nHe replied \"So are\
  \ we, I am headed to Alaska to find a medicine man, and remove my tumor. Care to\
  \ join?\" \n\n\"Sure why not.\" I replied.\n\n3 months later Airplane and I were\
  \ sitting in the bed of an old blue pickup, headed towards Spokane, [email\_protected]*#\
  \ It was in the cab. After driving down the long stretches of the #2 highway, which\
  \ was surrounded only by sage brush and red sands, we came to a local grocery store.\
  \  For the first time I saw the driver, a man whose peppered beard shone with kindness\
  \ and wisdom, told us he we treat us to some groceries and to go pick out some food.\
  \ \n\nWhen the pair and I were alone [email\_protected]*# It was glowing with excitement.\
  \  \"I have found him!\" he could barley contain himself.\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\
  \ Airplane and I asked.\n\n\"The driver, he's a medicine man! He's going to remove\
  \ the tumor from my head!\"\n\n\"No way!\" Airplane and I were so excited for him.\
  \  \n\n\"Yes he is going to take me to his place after dropping you guys in Spokane.\
  \ Then he is going to remove the tumor.\" \n\n\"Ok.\" I replied as I grabbed some\
  \ white bread, and headed towards the register. I believed everything back then,\
  \ yet it almost always worked out. \n\nThe old pale blue pickup dropped Airplane\
  \ and I off in Spokane, we wished [email\_protected]*# It farewell for the first\
  \ time, since I met him.  Airplane and I quickly found ourselves at home.  I was\
  \ nervous for [email\_protected]*# It, but I had faith. \n\nSpokane is a city in\
  \ the middle of the American rain forest, with a river raging through the middle.\
  \ Airplane and I indulged on the local buffets, and met many of the locals. \n\n\
  After finding a place to stay, and even some extra blankets, Airplane and I settled\
  \ right in.\n\nTwo days latter when we received the call, it was [email\_protected]*#\
  \ It. \n\n\"Hey guys, where are you at?\""
