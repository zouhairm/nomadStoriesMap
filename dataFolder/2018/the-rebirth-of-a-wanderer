Text: "I wasn\u2019t so sure about joining a tour group for my first time in South\
  \ America. I decided however, that my journey to Peru would be my reawakening as\
  \ an Earth Walker. Stepping outside of the airport, the clouds covered Cusco like\
  \ a perfect meringue on a lemon pie. The overcast, fluffy sky drizzled welcoming\
  \ sprinkles of an ancient energy to experience. My immediate introduction to this\
  \ lush country was honoring the great Pachamama, Mother Earth led by two shaman\
  \ women who were sisters. Cocoa leaves, sweets and shiny artifacts covered a woven\
  \ mat of magic. After prayers and offerings of gratitude, I was asked to cup a gourd\
  \ of libation made by PachaMama\u2019s plentiful gift, patata, potato, gold pieces\
  \ by the bushel. Pouring out this offering over a fire, I felt a resolve cover me.\
  \ The penance I was paying the high altitude left me completely. In that moment\
  \ I embraced the unknowns of this journey. The wanderer was officially awake. \n\
  \nArriving at the base of Machu Picchu was like Alice falling down the whole to\
  \ Wonderland only this was in reverse; we were going up, up and away. I immediately\
  \ felt the Incan ancestors lined up on both sides of the entrance, watching, gauging,\
  \ and sizing up all those who were drawn to this once secret, still sacred space.\
  \ Trudging up the stone steps, while trying to take in not the views but what was\
  \ below my feet, hallowed ground took my breath away as the clouds attempted to\
  \ replenish it. \n\nI finally reached a significant plateau in which to take in\
  \ the view I had only seen in pictures and documentaries. The massive rock gods\
  \ lush with the richness of PachaMama\u2019s generosity, loomed large and luxuriously.\
  \ I was reborn in this moment, eyes closed, bare feet dug deeply in the soil of\
  \ this mystical wonder of the world. As I sat on the ground, weeping for this moment,\
  \ I took out my Native American Animal Medicine cards and meditated on this auspicious\
  \ occasion. I shuffled the cards around on the grass and pulled a solitary card:\
  \ BAT! Bat means rebirth, transposes oneself into who you really are. The Wanderer\
  \ was reborn."
