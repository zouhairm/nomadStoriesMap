Text: "It was a different crowd that left the aircraft in Teheran, with the faces\
  \ and heads of women now indistinguishable in shawls and cloth and quite suddenly\
  \ the mood shifted. A barrier was erected, invisible yet I still felt it in the\
  \ air and in the sudden hesitation in my movement. The theocratic system in Iran\
  \ is far more restrictive in regards to civil rights and individual freedom than\
  \ western countries, a well-known albeit not well-liked fact.\n\nAnd I was planning\
  \ to defy that system. \n\nCouchsurfing is illegal in Iran and while preparing for\
  \ the trip I saw profiles of people having been questioned, if not harassed, by\
  \ the police and spending time in jail. Yet it was easier than ever before to find\
  \ people to host me. While I still felt a little bit anxious inside I held my breath\
  \ and dared. \n\nIt was easier after the first time.\n\nMy host welcomed me warmly\
  \ in his home and showed me some space on a floor already littered with sleeping\
  \ bags from other travellers and friends of his. Iranians and foreigners alike were\
  \ chatting over cultural differences and customs, trying to find some space in the\
  \ kitchen to make tea or getting worked up about the dreadful skills displayed by\
  \ the Iranian soccer league.The balcony looked like a construction site and after\
  \ an inquiring look of mine my host was quick to explain. They were putting up a\
  \ privacy shield on the balcony to decrease visibility of the balcony and the apartment.\
  \ Not only because they hosted foreigners, but to ensure additional protection if\
  \ women were to visit and wanted to relax in a secure environment, apart from the\
  \ prying eyes of their neighbours and the regime. \n\nAs I came back in the evening\
  \ after parading my new head scarf all over the city, drinking in the sights and\
  \ smells and getting lost and found by helpful Iranians, new faces awaited me in\
  \ the living room. A different set of people was lounging on the sofa, watching\
  \ football or finishing the last touches on the visual cover on the balcony. Another\
  \ Couchsurfer had arrived and as I lost abysmally in a card game, I silently enjoyed\
  \ the ordinarity of it all. Out of reach of government propaganda and behind the\
  \ confinements set forth by the regime, the pattern of human lives still continues\
  \ on, endlessly and all the same in the end. Not so different after all."
