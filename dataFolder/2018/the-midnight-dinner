Text: "\u201CRapid number 8!\u201D Henry, our rafting guide announced. \u201CThe name\
  \ of this rapid is \u2018The Midnight dinner\u2019 and we have three possible routes.\
  \ The first presents a 95% chance of capsizing us, the second, a 50% chance and\
  \ the third, a 5% chance. So, team Nairobi, do you want to go hard, medium or soft?\u201D\
  \nAlmost immediately, as if to block any doubts from dissuading us, we shouted in\
  \ unison, \u201CHard!\u201D\nWe had not capsized from rapid 1 to 7 and were thirsty\
  \ for some adrenaline. Little did we know that this thirst would indeed be sufficiently\
  \ quenched by the waters of the Zambezi.\nIt happened in a flash. I was holding\
  \ the grab rope one second and the next, I was out of the raft, thrown out forcefully.\
  \ Our raft had capsized from the back.\nI fought the water, struggling to come up\
  \ for air, but each time I managed, an angry wave would soon consume me. I tried\
  \ to open my mouth to let out a scream, only for water to dash right in. The torrent\
  \ ensured I could neither breathe nor seek help.\nOvercome with panic, I slid into\
  \ despair, and after a couple of seconds went blank, almost as if in preparation\
  \ for whatever fate had in store for me. I breathed in water and drank it, while\
  \ being carried quickly downstream. \nA kayaker came to my rescue after what felt\
  \ like eternity; but this is where the drama really began. \u201CHold onto this\u201D\
  , he said while pointing to the bow on his kayak. I obliged. \u201CAre you okay?\u201D\
  \ He asked. I threw up water in response. \u201COkay, I need you to put your legs\
  \ up here\u201D, he continued.\nI was still utterly confused about my state of life\
  \ and this guy wanted me to position my body in an up-side-down manner, while still\
  \ in the water! I ignored him but he reiterated and again, I obliged.\nAs soon as\
  \ my legs were up, he looked ahead, gasped and instructed, \u201CIf I capsize, let\
  \ go of me, okay?\u201D Before I could respond, Puff!\nAnother raging rapid and\
  \ I was on my own once again, attempting to breath, to live.\nHe followed me and\
  \ rescued me to my raft where I lay quietly, pensive about the fragility of life.\
  \ I would later gather enough strength to share my experience with my five team-mates.\n\
  In calm water, rafting in the Zambezi is a surreal experience. Surrounded by 110m-high\
  \ dark basalt rocks of the Batoka Gorge, it really does feel surreal. \nIn the rough\
  \ patches, it\u2019s as thrilling as it\u2019s life threatening.\nI\u2019m a certified\
  \ aquatics lifesaver and have rafted before; but the rapids of the Zambezi have\
  \ neither recognition, nor respect for your skills and/or experience."
