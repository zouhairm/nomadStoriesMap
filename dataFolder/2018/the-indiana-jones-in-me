Text: "\u201EWell, that sounds like fun\u201C, a girl of my group said while we signed\
  \ up for an adventure caving tour in Waitomo up in the north of New Zealand. Little\
  \ did I knew that the decision to switch from a comfortable boot tour to see glow\
  \ worms in a cave to an \u201CIndiana Jones\u201D like adventure trip instead would\
  \ not only push me out of my comfort zone but would turn into a lasting experience\
  \ I will probably never forget. \n\nI was travelling with a small group of strangers\
  \ through New Zealand. My life was pretty much at a downfall and the three week\
  \ vacation was a way to escape from everything I was not ready to deal with. Under\
  \ normal circumstances I would have never agreed to do such a caving tour, but with\
  \ my head not in the game I blindly signed up without knowing what I was going into.\
  \ \n\nAnd here I was, standing in full gear and strapped in harness in the middle\
  \ of a field. A few shaking steps later I found myself climbing down a few rocks\
  \ right down the rabbit hole. Warm air and pitch black darkness greeted me. Afraid\
  \ of heights and uncomfortable with dark, small spaces the tour would be definitely\
  \ a dream comes true. \n\nMoments later, I was dangling in a trance-like state from\
  \ an edge and slowly making my way down a 20 meters high climb. The darkness veiling\
  \ the heights I would probably otherwise panic over. The next three hours we spent\
  \ abseiling, climbing and sliding down rocks, our way marked by a little stream,\
  \ surrounded by nothing but sturdy walls, stalagmites and stalactites. Water from\
  \ the ceiling regularly dropping, sometimes purring down our necks. \n\nAt one point,\
  \ I was lying on my belly robbing through ankle deep waters; rocks closed in on\
  \ me on all sides but a little tunnel in front of me to move forward. Here, in the\
  \ water more than 100 meters underground I had the urge to laugh out loud about\
  \ the absurdity of the situation. Miles and miles from home, meters underground,\
  \ battling fears I never planned to battle.\n\nAt the deepest point of the cave,\
  \ we made a little break and switched out all our lights from the helmets. Complete\
  \ darkness surrounding us. And there, glowworms everywhere!  I then just knew all\
  \ will be fine. I pushed so hard to my personal limits and still here I was \u2013\
  \ happy. \n\nExhausted, with weak legs and arms and arching muscles we finally climbed\
  \ back up to the surface. A caving tour probably hundreds of tourists have made\
  \ before, but for me it was one of a life time experience which I still nourish\
  \ from more than two years later."
