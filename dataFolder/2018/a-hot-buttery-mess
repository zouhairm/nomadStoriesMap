Text: "I headed solo to Brussels, Belgium. I was staying in a cute studio apartment,\
  \ half a block from the Grand Place. The area was loud with touristy night life.\
  \ That first night I went out to dinner and then had a beer and watched some football\
  \ at a bar near the apartment. The next morning, I saw that the apartment had a\
  \ microwave. \n\nJust the sight of a microwave made me homesick. I decided that\
  \ I HAD to make some popcorn that night to indulge my craving.  I got to the apartment,\
  \ turned on a movie and tossed the popcorn in the microwave. I perched on the bed\
  \ across the room from the microwave, listening to the popcorn pop. \n\nI used my\
  \ favorite trick of counting three seconds in between pops; when you hit three seconds\
  \ that means your popcorn is done. \n\nWhen I opened the microwave door, flames\
  \ jumped up and hit the cabinet above the microwave. I screamed and then I froze.\
  \ Fear rushed through my body. I knocked over all the dishes in the sink, dumping\
  \ everything out of the used French press and filling it up with water. I started\
  \ tossing water on the fire. It wasn\u2019t stopping. I kept dumping water on it.\
  \ Rushing to refill the French press as fast as I could, then dumping half the water\
  \ on my feet. There was still one large flame left. I filled up the thing again,\
  \ dumping it on the remaining flame. Then I filled it up one last time dumping it\
  \ over the smoldering ashes. \n \nMy hands started shaking as I tried to open the\
  \ nearby window to let out the smoke. I took a step back to look at the mess I had\
  \ just made, praying the fire alarm wouldn\u2019t go off. There was smoke wafting\
  \ out the open window, water splashed across the floor, and a giant melted black\
  \ popcorn bag sitting in the microwave. \n\nI almost just burned down an entire\
  \ apartment building because I wanted popcorn so bad. While it wasn\u2019t necessarily\
  \ the popcorn\u2019s fault or even my own, it did teach me a lesson. \n\nHomesickness\
  \ is normal and it appears in bizarre ways. I was homesick for a microwave, a kitchen\
  \ that was familiar, and a snack that helps me relax. When I left for a long stay\
  \ in Europe, I knew I would be out of my comfort zone and would probably get a little\
  \ homesick. I had no idea I would get so homesick that I almost burned down Brussels,\
  \ but still, it was to be expected. \n\nSo, while I still haven\u2019t had my popcorn,\
  \ I have learned a valuable lesson. You will never know what will make you homesick\
  \ and when you find out, you don\u2019t necessarily have to have it."
