Text: "Townships often fall short of the recognition they deserve. More especially\
  \ a township situated 31,3km from the majestic Cape Town. Welcome to Khayelitsha,\
  \ where there\u2019s wide range of culture, famous for braaiing (Barbeque) meat\
  \ and well-known pubs. \n\nHome to over 2,4 million people, Khayelitsha is the largest\
  \ township in the Western Cape. It is a vibrant and predominantly youthful township.\
  \ It is also home to different classes of black, from the poor to black elites.\
  \  \n\nNavigating through this community shouldn\u2019t be mission at all. Available\
  \ transportation includes trains, buses and taxis. Taxis in South Africa aren\u2019\
  t the typical yellow private car with the taxi sign on top. To us, taxis are minibuses\
  \ \u2013 mostly Toyota Quantums. These kinds of transport circulate the area, reaching\
  \ every corner. \n\nOn a weekday morning \u2013 no earlier than 4am \u2013 you find\
  \ workers already making their way to railway stations. Fast paced men and women\
  \ leaving the township into the city to win bread for their families. Though this\
  \ is not often looked at in the deeper sense, one should realise that this is a\
  \ depiction of dedication.  \n\nAs weird as it may sound but, our weather has formed\
  \ part of our culture. Khayelitsha is a rain-deprived area. At times you would find\
  \ out that in Cape Town, over 30 kilometres away it's raining, whereas in Khayelitsha\
  \ it is as clear as day, pun intended. \n\nThere are also many places to dine, kasi\
  \ style. \u2018Kasi\u2019 is a term used to refer to the township. If it\u2019s\
  \ braaivleis (barbequed meat) you\u2019re looking for then you could make your way\
  \ to Embengweni (means barbeque place).  \n\nKhayelitsha is a place of many places.\
  \ For one, say you\u2019re looking for a relaxed place, a place high enough to view\
  \ the whole of Khayelitsha just through a pair of binoculars. Look-Out Hill offers\
  \ you that relaxation. It is well-built cylinder-like structure, with a glass finish\
  \ on its exterior. Making your way in, you\u2019ll be welcomed by a passage into\
  \ the amphitheatre. This place is also often used to host local events.  A stage\
  \ used for different types of events including, local talent shows, weddings, special\
  \ ceremonies and church events \u2013 just to name a few. \n\nEast of Look-Out Hill\
  \ is a long road with the right bordered by shacks. This is a scene often seen on\
  \ local films documenting what we would call our own PCH (Pacific Coast Highway).\
  \ Driving straight down this road will lead you to four-way junction that will direct\
  \ you to Mnandi Beach, meaning fun beach \u2013 need I say more?"
