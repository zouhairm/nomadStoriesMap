Text: "I departed for Africa on the 24th January 2018, yet my journey to the continent\
  \ of contrast started eight long years before hand. Since completing my formal schooling,\
  \ Early Education and Care had always been at the fore front of my career choices.\
  \ I worked for several years across the industry delivering direct childcare before\
  \ moving into a role as a Project Officer for a prominent and highly regarded childcare\
  \ organisation\n.\nAt the time this position was only contracted for a six month\
  \ period. In due consideration to this, I decided to book a holiday at the end of\
  \ the contract to rethink and re-plan about how I would move forward in the case\
  \ that my job was not renewed. The destination of Africa was spontaneous and even\
  \ a surprise to myself. Upon reading the tour notes, a day visit to the Himba Tribe\
  \ of Namibia enticed me. \n\nWhat captured my attention and connected to my heart\
  \ was the fact that a number of children in this village were orphaned.  Almost\
  \ immediately my thoughts turned to 'how can I help\u2019. Before my African adventure\
  \ began, I hosted a fundraising morning tea within my organisation. The morning\
  \ tea was every bit of the success I had hoped it would be and more. I was truly\
  \ blown away by the support and generosity shown to me by my colleagues.\n\nWhen\
  \ the day arrived and I finally got the visit the Himba tribe, I presented the full\
  \ backpack of donations to the teacher of the village. Our local guide Adam shared\
  \ information relating to the history, beliefs, customs and lifestyle of this group\
  \ although I was completely absorbed in interactions with the children to take on\
  \ board any of what was being communicated. \n\nPlay broke down every language barrier\
  \ that existed and it was the sound of laughter that confirmed verbal language was\
  \ not needed. After this visit I began to realise that this single moment was not\
  \ isolated; it was prompted by the previous years before hand. Not only had I connected\
  \ on an individual basis with the Himba Tribe but my world was now connected to\
  \ theirs. \n\nEvery day since returning home I take a moment to look through my\
  \ photographs from this day. On each occasion, without fail, my eyes swell with\
  \ tears from wanting to be back amongst this beautiful and unique community, yet,\
  \ I take reassurance from remembering the strength of the connection that was made\
  \ between their world and mine. Gina Bellman wrote it perfectly when she said 'I\
  \ love those connections that make the big old world feel like a little village'."
