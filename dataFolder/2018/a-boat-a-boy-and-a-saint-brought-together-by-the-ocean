Text: "It was a hot day in the sleepy town of San Juan Del Sur that I learned of the\
  \ ocean\u2019s unifying power. A day that whisked me away on some dingy boat, thrust\
  \ upon a crescent moon-shaped bay. I was only sixteen and living in Nicaragua for\
  \ a month, young and hungry for the kind of adventure that at the end of the day,\
  \ made one glad they were there.\n\nI didn\u2019t expect much that afternoon, so\
  \ when my friends yelled in a frantic, \u201CWe\u2019re gonna be in a boat parade,\
  \ let\u2019s go!\u201D, I found myself making a mad dash for the pier. I\u2019m\
  \ a girl of spontaneity, so I didn\u2019t ask questions. A local had invited us\
  \ onto his boat to celebrate the \"Procesi\xF3n Virgen del Carmen\" in which the\
  \ statue of the saint was brought onto a boat to bless the harbour. \n\nThat day\
  \ the ocean was magnetic, like some inescapable gravity commanding everyone to the\
  \ shore. Children dove into the sea putting on a display of acrobatics. Other boats\
  \ began zipping around, first one, then two, then so many we lost count. They cut\
  \ diamonds through the sparkling water as they welcomed our little boat with cheers\
  \ and smiles and loud Latin music. I had never seen anything like it. We were so\
  \ entranced that we didn\u2019t even notice the small child who had found his way\
  \ onto our boat. He looked up at us with wide eyes and a quivering lip. \n\n\u201C\
  \xBFC\xF3mo te llamas?\u201D One of us tries to say. \n\nThe little boy became known\
  \ to us as Diego and we tried to comfort him as best as we could. Finally, we saw\
  \ a vessel full of frantic faces waving at us urgently. With the combined efforts\
  \ of both boats, Diego returned to his family. Cheers erupted as we waved goodbye\
  \ to our new friend.\n \nAnd then we were waiting, waves thrashing impatiently against\
  \ the vessel. Waiting for something extraordinary, something we could take home\
  \ with us and share with everyone who wasn\u2019t lucky enough to be there. \n\n\
  At last, St. Carmen takes her rightful place at sea. Her boat breaks the anticipation\
  \ and makes a beeline towards open water. All the boats roar to life and follow\
  \ her lead, like wolves howling into the night. Our boat cuts through cerulean waves,\
  \ never breaking stride from the pack, becoming one with the other vessels.  \n\n\
  I was in such a daze for the rest of that day. I felt accepted by the locals and\
  \ felt an immense sense of gratitude that they allowed us to be a part of their\
  \ celebrations. The ocean had brought us together in a way that overcame any language\
  \ or cultural barrier. \n\nAnd that night I thought to myself, \n\n\u201CI\u2019\
  m really glad I\u2019m here\u201D."
