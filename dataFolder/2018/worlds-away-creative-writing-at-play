Text: "A car-dependent sunny Southern Californian agrees to be dropped into public\
  \ transit heavy, showery DC for an internship. This Angeleno, a soon to be college\
  \ graduate who\u2019s braved both in and out of country journeys for a maximum trip\
  \ length of two weeks,  is about to enter the effervescent Chesapeake Bay replete\
  \ with politicos, tourists, and academics for ten weeks. What does she expect? She\
  \ knows the proverbial cup that she is about to partake contains a blend of trepidation\
  \ and idealism mixed with a polished elevator pitch and a compulsory sense of ultra-professionalism.\
  \ She is me, this is my story and those were my expectations. Thus, the last thing\
  \ I expected in this mecca of politics and business where I was drawn to gain real\
  \ world work experience was to have my youthful passion for creative writing reawakened.\
  \ In terms of story ideas, I had been mentally infertile for the better part of\
  \ my college years as my focus had been on how to be a responsible adult rather\
  \ than how to be an accomplished freelance writer. Nonetheless, it happened during\
  \ the internship program\u2019s orientation day while playing the business-casual\
  \ dressed tourist at the National Mall. When I entered the Lincoln Memorial, what\
  \ struck me wasn\u2019t the statue\u2019s stern stare or the walls\u2019 inscriptions,\
  \ but the wonderment of a child tourist asking his father \u201CWhat\u2019s war?\u201D\
  \ The next moment felt as if someone had turned down the volume to the din of the\
  \ crowd so the father\u2019s response could be heard better. I had to capture it\
  \ all in some way, and a clich\xE9 video recording wouldn\u2019t do it justice but\
  \ would nosily broadcast the family\u2019s life and identity and rob me the pleasure\
  \ of imagining their story myself. My fingers itched for the familiar notebook and\
  \ pencil but I settled for my phone\u2019s Notepad and typed away the ensuing conversation\
  \ and the carefully selected setting details for my readers to envision. The creative\
  \ juices were flowing and my mind reacted thusly: Wait, did I just think of readers\
  \ for this vignette? No [outward chuckle of disbelief]! Did I just reference myself\
  \ as having a vignette after years of discussing theses, forecasts or the works\
  \ of notable authors? This prolific reawakening was real and I would attempt to\
  \ keep it alive for the remainder of the trip and afterwards. This bi-coastal traveler\
  \ felt as if she was back, like this dormant writer persona had grown in tandem\
  \ with the new me, waiting for the right time to re-emerge. And I am determined\
  \ to keep her active."
