  \ During a visit to Nicaragua, Carolina\u2019s words resonated for a long time.\n\
  My first trip here coincided with an intro to surfing, which became a theme for\
  \ future trips. With a fantasy built on movies, one point made this a pipe dream;\
  \ learning to surf is the hardest activity - ever.\nPro\u2019s aren\u2019t born\
  \ that way! I can\u2019t emphasize how much practice and hard work go into reaching\
  \ an expert level. Wanting to improve, I opted for a camp. \nCamps are often expensive,\
  \ starting around $1500/week - my budget for a month of travel. I found one in Nicaragua\
  \ for less than a third of that.\nStoked to arrive at Rapture, I was fascinated\
  \ to learn the Nica coaches grew up riding the local breaks. Enjoying a beer and\
  \ getting to know each other, we became fast friends.\nThe view high up a hill didn\u2019\
  t get boring. The tree canopy ended at the white sand, drifting off into the Pacific.\
  \ Her endless waves made settling in effortless.  \nThe end of the rainy season\
  \ meant a mess in the sea and on the roads. Each day at beaches like Remanso or\
  \ Maderas, the coaches gave pointers with each attempt at a wave.  They developed\
  \ my understanding of technique and were encouraging when things became hard.\n\
  Battling lousy conditions, good old frenemy, frustration, showed up. At Hermosa,\
  \ I lost it. Tossed around like a sack of cotton-balls, I grabbed the rails of the\
  \ board to ride back to shore.\nAndars met me and asked \u201Cque tal amiga?\u201D\
  \nI answered, \u201Csurfing\u2019s not for me, I suck.\u201D\n\u201CCome on, forgetting\
  \ the good days?\u201D\nI was so annoyed, I returned to the basics of white-water\
  \ and courage reappeared. Surfing is only 10% riding waves, the rest is paddling\
  \ and staring at the horizon waiting for waves.\nLucky for us, Yankees had a swell\
  \ of 1-2\u2019.  It\u2019s a fast wave that forms a barrel, way beyond my capabilities.\
  \ Yet, on this small day boldness rippled through each of us.\nThe coaches yelled\
  \ \u201CDale!\u201D, or \u2018Give it!\u2019. Determined, paddling with deliberate\
  \ strokes, I gave it! At that moment, it dawned on me that I may be a surfer after\
  \ all.\nEager to paddle back out to the line-up, I noticed the coaches beaming with\
  \ pride. A week and a half with the right guidance, I had advanced more than years\
  \ of going it alone.\nI have no delusion of ever going pro or even getting past\
  \ an intermediate level. With the friendship and awe-inspiring places surfing takes\
  \ me, I\u2019m happy to perch out there and smile at what\u2019s around."
