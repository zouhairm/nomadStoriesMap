Text: "Growing up in Delhi, the capital city of a huge and diverse nation, one does\
  \ take the cosmopolitan lifestyle for granted. Food, music, art and brands from\
  \ all corners of a country that stretches over 3.287 million sq. km blend seamlessly\
  \ in an area that merely 0.04% of the whole.  \n\nIn this sort of multi-hued social\
  \ fabric, it is usually one\u2019s personal stories that give special meaning to\
  \ some cultures over others. In my case, I identify just the slightest bit more\
  \ with Tamil Nadu, the state from which my grandparents migrated to Delhi. Yet this\
  \ has always been an imagined, abstract connection, because I\u2019ve never visited\
  \ it. So, I was delighted when my knowledge of Tamil meant a work trip was fixed\
  \ for me \u2018down south\u2019 \u2013 the interior regions of the state. In fact,\
  \ I would be going as far as the southernmost tip of the land, a place sometimes\
  \ considered mystic. \n\nAt the airport, I met my companion for the trip, our organization\u2019\
  s point of contact in the area, R. R had grown up in Tamil Nadu and had years of\
  \ experience with their industry. Youthful, energetic and immensely helpful, he\
  \ was excited that I have ties with the state. After all, I did understand Tamil,\
  \ I\u2019d heard Carnatic music my whole life, my family ate dosas, I followed the\
  \ same rituals and we prayed to the same deities. \n\nBut for the three days I spent\
  \ there, I realized that every person I met could identify me as a \u2018foreigner\u2019\
  \ immediately. My name and facial features were south Indian, but my accent stood\
  \ out. From my habits to my questions, I was clearly from out of town and was treated\
  \ accordingly with a slightly distant courtesy and even pity. Our guide explained\
  \ to me that in this remote hamlet, one\u2019s origin was decided by one\u2019s\
  \ own upbringing and circumstances, not one\u2019s ancestry \u2013 if I\u2019d grown\
  \ up in Delhi, I certainly wasn\u2019t \u2018local\u2019 enough for the locals.\
  \ \n\nAs we drove through the forests and round the hills, R and I had long conversations\
  \ about his travels through the towns and villages, the customs he had grown up\
  \ with, the differing dialects in every district and the political and historical\
  \ dynamics in the volatile state. At the end of three days, I hadn\u2019t seen the\
  \ famous backwaters, the gorgeous temples or the popular beaches, but I\u2019d learned\
  \ something about their origin and their place in the world today. \n\nGoing back\
  \ to my cosmopolitan city I praised R for being a bridge between the cultures and\
  \ I wondered, what is foreign and what is local? It\u2019s just a matter of what\
  \ you embrace."
