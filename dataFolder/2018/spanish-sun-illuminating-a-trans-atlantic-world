Text: "In the Spring semester of 2017, I began my first Spanish class. Studying Political\
  \ Science, I spent the majority of my university days focused on communication.\
  \ Naturally, I'd figured, I ought to learn some Spanish before my undergraduate\
  \ days were over.\n\nEarly in the semester, a professor came into class to advertise\
  \ the university's annual study-abroad program. She had been on a trip to Mexico\
  \ in the preceding weeks, and she looked it: well-tanned with chapulines, or grasshoppers,\
  \ in hand. I was the only student to try the food, a moment that today stays in\
  \ my mind as a red-pill/blue-pill moment, like in the movie \"The Matrix.\" I was\
  \ also the only student in that class who convinced himself to disregard his inhibitions\
  \ and spend that June in the Spanish sun in M\xE1laga, learning about Spanish language,\
  \ culture, history, and intimately studying the art of Pablo Picasso in the town\
  \ where he spent his early years. So much happened during that month that to tell\
  \ one story would be an injustice to all. My memory of Picasso's childhood home\
  \ in M\xE1laga would be jealous of my memory of the night I spent in Madrid when\
  \ Real Madrid won the UEFA final. To talk about the Spanish influence on nearly\
  \ the entire world would be to undermine the way the Spanish made the world a smaller,\
  \ more local place.\n\nAfter the trip, I had the honor of presenting research on\
  \ Picasso's still-life paintings at the Athens Institute for Education and Research's\
  \ 5th Annual Conference on Arts and Humanities in a Global World. Clearly, I thought\
  \ when I arrived in Athens on January 2nd, 2018, the investments I had made that\
  \ summer paid off. What I found in Spain, Greece, and my succeeding Spanish classes\
  \ at the university, was a world of diversity packed into what was a small world,\
  \ after all. Almost each neighborhood in Spain has its own personality; so, too,\
  \ does its legacy in the Western Hemisphere. Yet, they are all bound by traditions\
  \ and language that I could now understand.\n\nThis experience shed light my own\
  \ country, my neighbors, and the world as a whole; I now see a whole world that\
  \ had previously been in the dark to me. Further, my Spanish-speaking skills have\
  \ improved enough to be able to talk with both a professor from a Spanish university\
  \ and a group of young Argentinian men like me, as we all walked along the ruins\
  \ at the Greek Temple of Apollo. The world, I've learned, is both huge and tiny;\
  \ it is both widespread and local."
