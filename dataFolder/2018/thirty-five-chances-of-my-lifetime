Text: "Prominent people did not start at the limelight of their glory. Some are fortunate\
  \ to be born and served on a silver platter. Some battling in Armageddon splattering\
  \ and spitting blood to survive. Wise decision is important, \u2018twas like a compass\
  \ guiding your journey to the ends of the earth.\n\nThirty-four chances and spectacular\
  \ moments of my life were spent in South East Asia. \u201CPerla del Mar de Oriente\u201D\
  \ is such a pride known for its natural beauty and rich biodiversity, Philippines.\
  \ My country composes of three main gigantic islands, not to mention that it really\
  \ has a huge seven thousand one hundred seven islands nationwide. I grew up in the\
  \ Philippines\u2019 Land of Promise, Mindanao. An ancient Rajahnate of Butuan in\
  \ Northeast Region (Caraga) is now a city where my rich childhood encapsulated.\
  \ The etymology of Caraga came from the native word Kalag which means \u201Cspirit\
  \ of soul\u201D and An which means land. The region was being called land of the\
  \ brave and fierce people by early chroniclers, according to GovPH.\n\nI was the\
  \ third among the six siblings.I was fortunate to have memories playing outside\
  \ the house, neighborhood, streets, schools, etc.We have native games like Patintero,\
  \ Tumbang lata/preso, Shatong, Chinese Garter Luksong Kabaw and Luksong Tinik. Survival\
  \ of the fittest was always the game of life among the six of us.That never stopped\
  \ me from dreaming to travel.Poverty helps me to push myself and made wise decisions.With\
  \ all my might,I stand up and decided to see the other side of mundane world wherein\
  \ I can be a possible champion,the capital city of the Philippines.Looking back,\
  \ at a young age, travel awakens my soul.I saw a huge and verdant pineapple plantation\
  \ meets the sky in the landlocked province,Bukidnon in Northern Mindanao.The view\
  \ are filling my empty soul.My conscious mind is telling me that I need to see all\
  \ the beautiful sceneries.There's an instance of my life that I thought it's already\
  \ end of the world,Y2K.I joined  our community's immersion to reach the unfortunate\
  \ kids.I saw the magnificent  Dinagat Islands, a group of islands composing a province\
  \ in Caraga Region, Philippines. Life is so simple, walking barefoot at the seashore\
  \ while the day was wrestling in darkness is pretty awesome. Lots of adventures\
  \ to tell but limited. Now,I am here in the land of Aotearoa.\n\nBill Gates said,\
  \ \u201CIf you are born poor it\u2019s not your mistake, but if you die poor it\u2019\
  s your mistake.\u201D  Challenges are the best teacher that we can have,free of\
  \ charge."
