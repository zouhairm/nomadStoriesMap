Text: "The sun was about to set. I sat on the beach, waiting for the sky to turn blue-black\
  \ from its current orange-pink canvas. Suddenly, someone from the behind said, \"\
  Didi! (Sister).\"\n \nI turned back and found an old lady standing behind a cart\
  \ filled with coconuts. She smiled and offered me a coconut. I sat next to her enjoying\
  \ the sunset and refreshing coconut water. I started asking her questions about\
  \ the small beach-town of Ganpatipule, located on the Konkan coast of western India.\n\
  \  \nIntrigued, I started asking about the town. \u201CThe best thing,\u201D she\
  \ said, \u201Cabout any place is the food.\u201D  \n\n\u201CWhy are you here?\u201D\
  \ she asked. I looked at the beach and said, \"I work 9-10 hrs a day and live the\
  \ same life. I came for some peace and quietness.\"  \n\n\"Alone?\" she asked.\n\
  \ \nI smiled and said yes. She was shocked and asked me why was I travelling alone.\n\
  \ \nBurying my feet deeper into the sand, I said that it is perfectly normal for\
  \ girls now to travel alone. For her, life has only been about taking care of others.\
  \ \n She smiled at me and said she has loved her life despite the hardships, but\
  \ wished to have guts to do something for herself. She shot me a grin and said the\
  \ only rebellious thing she has done is start selling coconut water on the beach.\
  \ \n  \n\"Here, I have met so many kinds of people...some good, some rude, but always\
  \ different. I have made friends from America also,\" she said proudly. \n She had\
  \ the spirit of a young woman still \u2013 a thirst to learn more and see the world\
  \ through others\u2019 experiences.\n \nI realised how I had stopped doing what\
  \ I loved \u2013 travel and write. \n\nThis trip was made in 2016. And it became\
  \ one of the many trips I have taken since then. \n\nThe old lady\u2019s enthusiasm\
  \ and warmth to a complete stranger make me still smile. She spoke to me without\
  \ prejudices and gave me more information about the small town than any book or\
  \ website would have ever given me. While guidebooks tell you what to see in a place,\
  \ only a person of that land can tell you the soul and heart of that place. She\
  \ has a special place in my heart because she taught me that the will to live should\
  \ never cease. Her spirit, smile and her childlike innocence are what I still carry\
  \ with me. \n\nSince then, I make sure to I interact with the native people. No\
  \ one knows the land better than its own children. They can tell you the best-kept\
  \ secrets to explore the place. I now not only travel, but explore \u2013 the nooks\
  \ and corners, the hearts and eyes, and most importantly, the souls."
