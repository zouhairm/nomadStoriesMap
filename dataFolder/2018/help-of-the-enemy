Text: "I think one of the characteristics that makes one a traveler is the various\
  \ difficulties faced during the journey. Thus, for the sake of adventure, I sometimes\
  \ dont plan every single detail of my trip in advance. During a such trip to Spain,\
  \ I decided to spend my last day in the town of Sitges. Spent the night in Spain\
  \ surfing online for some place to stay at but all the hotels, hostels and even\
  \ the Airbnb were booked from late summer till the month of December. Being an optimist\
  \ I arrived at Sitges in the morning, approached the help desk and it turned out\
  \ that I was the 1st Azerbaijani to visit Sitges even though the city was a very\
  \ popular tourist destination. I was informed that I'd definitely find a place to\
  \ stay in pointed hostels. Took the address and found the place thinking that I'd\
  \ settle down in any room. But there was no receptionist or a contact person at\
  \ the place. I had to climb along the long stairs up to the 4th floor with my heavy\
  \ bag.  All rooms were taken.The sentence\u2013\u201CYou cannot find an empty place\
  \ in Sitges without booking in advance\u201D-sounded like a curse. Time was flying,\
  \ already afternoon. I didn\u2019t know where to go and was walking aimlessly down\
  \ the streets. Heat, stuffiness, exhaustion and uncertainty\u2026 I was close to\
  \ tears. For a while I stopped, looked around and saw a man smoking at the balcony\
  \ of a house. Asked him in English:\n-\u201CHi. I\u2019m looking for a place to\
  \ stay the night. Do you know any such place?\u201D\n-Ohh, In Sitges? Unlikely.\
  \ The places here're reserved months in advance. We have moved here recently. Hold\
  \ on, let me ask my wife.\nThey both came down to greet me within a few minutes:\
  \ \n-Hi, I am Grigory.This's my wife Tatev. \nI hesitated to introduce myself. I\
  \ gathered from their names that I was standing in front of armenians who are from\
  \ a neighboring country that's at war with us-Azerbaijan. We closed our borders\
  \ after the war that took place 25years ago and we haven\u2019t had any communication\
  \ since. Both sides of the conflict promote only aggression and hostility. I was\
  \ a kid at the time of the war and the loss of human life still traumatizes me.\
  \ Even though I was in favor of peace,for a few micro seconds I wondered how they'd\
  \ react when I respond their question where I was from:\n-I\u2019m Gulya. Azerbaijan.\
  \ \nThere was a few seconds of silence. Seconds that felt like hours.\u201CI will\
  \ take you to an old woman\u2019s house where we used to stay.That\u2019s the only\
  \ place that might have an empty room\u201D\u2013Grigory said.I found a room and\
  \ settled down\u2026"
