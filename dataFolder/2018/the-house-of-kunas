Text: "The Jeep rolls over the steep hills that lead to the Port of Cart\xEC. Blas\
  \ Lopez, a 50-year old Kuna born on the island has been passionately telling me\
  \ for the whole trip from Panama City about his world and the controversies that\
  \ modernity has brought upon them. \nThe Kuna began a migration from northern Colombia\
  \ to Panama about 200 years ago. Once settled in the jungle of the Dari\xE9n province,\
  \ they started a journey that would bring them to the northern coast. While some\
  \ of them founded the inland communities of Madugandi and Wargandi, some of them\
  \ reached the sea and founded the community of Kuna Yala. Known by most people as\
  \ the archipelago of San Blas, Kuna Yala its heaven on Earth with crystal clear\
  \ water, white sand plenty of sea food. The Kuna built their communities on 5 of\
  \ the more than 360 island that make the archipelago, and since then conducted a\
  \ simple and long-lasting lifestyle based on fishing.\nBlas has to stop his tale\
  \ as we reach the port. The sea is rough today with big waves and strong winds from\
  \ the North, the worst of all. After about 15 minutes we reach Cart\xEC, an island\
  \ that is about to explode. Climate change has been hitting the island so bad that\
  \ their homes touch the water, and the whole population will be relocated to the\
  \ mainland by 2019. \nThe boat stops at a tiny port, our access to Blas' house.\
  \ An abandoned canoe is used to dry clothes, and 2 small cabinets are used as toilet\
  \ and lavatory. Blas briefly introduces me to his brothers and siblings. The house\
  \ is a gigantic dormitory made of 4 rooms that are only separated by drapes, the\
  \ pavement is raw terrain and the are hammocks everywhere. As I am welcomed by a\
  \ warm supper, Blas prepares my hammock and says goodnight. \nWaking up I feel like\
  \ I need hammock-sleeping lessons. In the main room, a mother is helping her daughter\
  \ to lace her shoes and sends her off to school. Education has improved drastically\
  \ in the last 30 years, says Blas, even though teenagers are facing serious issues\
  \ with drugs coming from Colombia through the archipelago. Walking through the streets\
  \ of Cart\xEC I feel welcomed, and kids are smiling at any given time. Curiosity\
  \ wins over shyness. \nOn my last night on the island Evelio, Blas' brother, makes\
  \ dinner while I have a pleasant chat with her sister, Edita. She tells me how women\
  \ are empowered in the Kuna society, and lingers in fairytales about the moon-blessed\
  \ albinos. An evocative night that makes me want to stay in touch with this fascinating\
  \ community."
