Text: "The old man has kind eyes and a strong command of English.\n\n\u201CI came\
  \ to Israel from Iraq when I was six, with my family. I grew up in this kibbutz.\u201D\
  \n\nHis dust-covered Ford ute rattles along the narrow dirt track, having turned\
  \ off the asphalt road from where he has picked me up.\n\n\u201CThere,\u201D he\
  \ points beyond the wire fence to a number of rectangular dams, \u201Dis where we\
  \ farm the fish.\u201D\n\nI see two men in the distance working to fix a pump.\n\
  \n\u201CIt is hot,\u201D the old man says, following my gaze. \u201CWould you like\
  \ to eat lunch with me?\u201D\n\nI nod, and my tour of his kibbutz continues. He\
  \ points out the dairy, the mechanic workshop, and, with pride, a field of date\
  \ palms.\n\n\u201CI planted all of those myself, all 9000 of them, in 1963.\u201D\
  \n\nI imagine a much younger man, with the same kind eyes and generous nature, working\
  \ the field or picking up a hitchhiker without a second thought.\n\nThe ute stopping\
  \ abruptly jolts me back to the present.\n\nBefore us is an ageing white concrete\
  \ house, cracks in its red-tiled roof sprawling like vines on a tree.\n\nA woman\
  \ ambles across the garden to greet us. Her deeply-creased face breaks into a wide\
  \ smile as warm as the afternoon sun bathing us.\n\nWithout trepidation, she welcomes\
  \ me inside.\n\nPhotos of children adorn the walls, the shelves, the drawers. The\
  \ home breathes goodwill.\n\nThe man puts before me a glass of freshly-squeezed\
  \ pomegranate juice to quench my thirst. We eat fresh dates from a palm in their\
  \ yard as they tell me of their lives, of their children, of the changing function\
  \ of the kibbutz in a modern world.\n\nIt is time to eat. The old man drives me\
  \ to the communal hall, and we devour a large plate of fish and vegetables in the\
  \ company of his friends and neighbours. I am thankful for the food but more so\
  \ for the brief companionship. The old man just smiles.\n\nWe drive on. The ute\
  \ comes to a stop at a large concrete building serving as an immigration point.\
  \ The Star of David on the Israeli flag dances above us. Beyond that, the red, black,\
  \ white, and green of the Jordanian flag looms.\n\nThe old man shakes my hand, and\
  \ proffers a \u201Cgood luck\u201D. I hesitate. I don\u2019t want to get out of\
  \ the ute. I want to stay here longer but I must keep going. I utter a thank you,\
  \ his kindness suddenly overwhelming me. But to him, it is simply human nature.\n\
  \nHe gives me one final endearing smile as his ute lurches forward in a cloud of\
  \ dust so to return once more to his kibbutz. I turn and walk on."
