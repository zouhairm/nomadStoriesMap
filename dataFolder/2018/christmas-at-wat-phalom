Text: "Thanks to world renowned photographers, travel writers, and the recent boom\
  \ in social media - more people are frequenting countries that were once much less\
  \ traveled due to fear of the unknown or the unfamiliar. \nLast year, I traveled\
  \ to Bali. I felt that although I tried immersing myself into the local experience\
  \ as much as possible, I was craving a much more raw adventure. I felt an innately\
  \ strong pull to travel into the unknown. I researched volunteer opportunities all\
  \ over SE Asia, and what I found was an opportunity to volunteer and live in a Buddhist\
  \ temple. Sold. \nI hopped on a puddle jumper to a remote airport in the Isaan region\
  \ of Thailand, and managed to get myself to the small city of Bueng Kan. After hours\
  \ of peering at barren land through the windows of a very precarious old school\
  \ bus, I found us approaching a lush forest up ahead. The rickety bus pulled up\
  \ in front of a giant statue of Buddha and opened its doors.\nI stepped outside\
  \ to see 4 monks walking in sync around the Buddha, barefoot. Behind the statue\
  \ was the beautiful Mae Kong River separating Thailand from Laos. \nI was immediately\
  \ beckoned by an older woman (who appeared to be a nun) to follow her. I quickly\
  \ learned that nobody on the premises spoke English, and I undoubtedly spoke no\
  \ Thai. With the help of hand gestures, and the translator app on my phone (when\
  \ Wifi permitted), I was able to get around for the rest of the evening by following\
  \ closely behind my new friend.\n4 am came my wake up call- not by alarm, but by\
  \ hungry roosters awaiting their breakfast. I walked outside to find the monks and\
  \ nuns making their way to the temple for morning meditation. Attempting to stifle\
  \ my yawns, I made it through the next hour of sitting on the floor in silence.\
  \ The nuns (who were all sitting in the back) hurriedly arose and scurried over\
  \ to the outdoor kitchen. \nI was handed a giant metal grater and a coconut. I was\
  \ also (reluctantly) handed a machete to chop the cilantro and mushrooms. This was\
  \ their daily routine. Every morning they cooked one meal for the monks to enjoy\
  \ before retreating off to their quarters for the rest of the day to spend in solitude.\
  \ The rest of the nuns' day consisted of cleaning the grounds, followed by two hours\
  \ of walking meditation. In the evenings, we ate Thai snacks and practiced yoga\
  \ together in the privacy of our cabin. Although not many words were exchanged in\
  \ my time at Wat Phalom, the experiences and relationships that I left with were\
  \ unforgettable."
