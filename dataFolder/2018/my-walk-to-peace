Text: "Huayna Picchu via Salkantay. With any nature trail, I expect a lot of walking,\
  \ history; and in the end, Machu Picchu. Living in the city, my vacations gravitate\
  \ toward nature. Give me the peace of being home with nature. What I did not expect\
  \ was to have my own personal spiritual retreat. For four days, we trekked through\
  \ the wilderness and absorbed life lessons from our guide about the Inca. We learned\
  \ what it means to understand and send positivity to the universe. Once to Machu\
  \ Picchu, he released us, a pack of tired wolf pups meandering around until it was\
  \ time for me to climb HP. Exhausted and relinquishing my visit to the upper sector,\
  \ I left the grounds for a much need pick-me-up. Oh sweet coffee, nectar of the\
  \ gods. So, with four days of hiking under my belt, armed with my life lessons on\
  \ peace, I set out to climb Huayna Picchu. \nThis climb was amazing. It was mostly\
  \ stairs that got so steep and narrow you had to climb on all fours! I made it to\
  \ the top before everyone else. So there I was: at the tippity top of a mountain,\
  \ in the Andes, IN PERU, alone. The amount of peace hanging in the air was so palpable\
  \ my brain was about to implode. \nTime stood still. The sun was shining. I sat\
  \ there on the rock like a lizard basking in the sun. I finally got to experience\
  \ what it was like to be on the top of a mountain, and it was exhilarating. I don\u2019\
  t think I\u2019ve ever felt so at peace. There were no obligations, no notifications,\
  \ no anticipating. The only obligation was to sit, take a deep breath, and let nature\
  \ quiet your soul. I could have laid there forever.\nThe sunshine, quietness, and\
  \ the scenery was everything you need to just exhale and release all of the negative\
  \ energy that\u2019s been slowly building up inside of you. It felt like Mother\
  \ Nature herself was saying, \u201CIt\u2019s okay, let it all go.\u201D Like a mother\
  \ comforting her child. For all the millenials out there: it felt like I had \u201C\
  turned if off and turned it back on again\u201D. \nHearing the commotion below brought\
  \ me back down to Earth. I guess I should get a move on, and let others have the\
  \ chance to experience this moment, too! Also, I didn\u2019t want to feel so crowded\
  \ on the way down. I was enjoying this alone time on this mountain after hanging\
  \ out with my family for four days. I descended the mountain at a leisurely pace,\
  \ encouraging others to keep climbing and that it\u2019s worth the challenge. I\
  \ slowly made my way back to the entrance of the park, completely cleansed of negativity,\
  \ only beaming positivity."
