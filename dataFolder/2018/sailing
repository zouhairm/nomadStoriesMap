Text: "There once was a man, who lived on a kite.\nHe sailed through the air, morning\
  \ and night.\nIt all started one day, when he decided to run away.\nFrom his problems,\
  \ his worries, his stresses, his pain.\nHe left in such a hurry, his mind made up\n\
  \u201CI\u2019ll never go back\u201D, his clever thought\u2019s thought.\nAnd so\
  \ he fled, the land he knew.\nFor adventure, for freedom, for solitude.\nHe stayed\
  \ only in his company, with no one else by his side\nWhen he started to feel lonely,\
  \ he just let those feelings creep by.\nAnd onward he sailed, over mountains and\
  \ oceans\nHe sailed over lands, only created by imagination.\nUntil much later,\
  \ when years had passed\nHe could no longer suppress, those sad feelings he had.\n\
  He longed for a friend and secretly wished\nHe had never gone on this journey alone,\
  \ in a bittersweet bliss.\nWith a slight grudge, he changed the direction\nAnd flew\
  \ on the current to his home, his empty mansion.\nOn the journey back, he felt a\
  \ strange feeling take over\nOf anticipation, nerves which excited him even more.\n\
  The days and night, came and went\nUntil at last he was home, he was back.\nHe rushed\
  \ through the streets as soon as he landed,\nHe ran through the small town, \nGreeting\
  \ every person, ecstatic.\nThe townspeople remembered,\nEmbraced him and cried\n\
  \u2018Welcome home dear friend, \nNow come along, come inside.\u2019\nThey all offered\
  \ him into their homes\nBut he only stayed a short while, soon he grew weary\nAnd\
  \ went back to his house for rest, to retire.\nHe sat on his bed, dressed in his\
  \ old favourite pajamas\nAnd thought to himself, I\u2019m too tired to count llamas.\n\
  He fell into a deep sleep, as soon as his head hit the pillow\nWhen he woke up,\
  \ the sun shone and he felt peace,\nAs if the future was possible."
