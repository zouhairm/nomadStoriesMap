Text: "\"Coorg\" The Scotland of India. \n\nThere's doesn't exist a better feeling\
  \ for a Nemophilist than to be lost in the woods on a fuzzy weather, i experienced\
  \ something similar on my way to the Scotland of India \"coorg\"\nIt is located\
  \ in South India, karnataka. \nIt was the  first time i visited the city, It drizzled\
  \ continously but i still  could explore the wonderful blizz of the place. \nThe\
  \ native language is kodava language the people  there are from a unique traditional\
  \ and cultural background. The city is filled with many tourist places which attracts\
  \ the  travelers from all over the world. \nThe majority of land  is for agriculture\
  \ they usually grow coffee and areca nut, I spent most of my time in the  estates\
  \ where i  tasted the best wine in my life i could witness the lifestyle of kodava's\
  \ very keenly,\nI  even  had a chance to spectate their traditional dance known\
  \ as \n  \" Kodava vaalaga aat\". \nI also visited the  forests where they have\
  \ a wide range of wildlife which are excellently conserved.\nThen the last  place\
  \  i visited was \"Mandakpatti\" its the peak of a  mountain where i felt i could\
  \ touch the sky  for the first time in my life, the fog had taken over the place\
  \ which was one of the memorable moments of the hike. \nSo i had a great time in\
  \ coorg i got educated as well as  entertained,If you are a travel freak coorg is\
  \ a must visitable place on the list."
