Text: "The next day I was observing Hyunju's class again, letting my gaze wander to\
  \ the window. It was the end of summer and the sky was hazy. The haze had been there\
  \ since I arrived, or maybe it was just my own haze; I still didn\u2019t have much\
  \ of a sense of direction about town. And teaching was still a constant befuddlement.\
  \ When I entered the classroom, the students were fighting over the special seat.\
  \ \n\nWhat was the special seat? I had asked. The one with the best view of the\
  \ volcano, Hyunju responded. However, since you could see the volcano from any seat,\
  \ anywhere in the school, the particular seat that was the special seat changed\
  \ every day. Today, when Billy finally got the special seat, Sally Sue, who usually\
  \ had the special seat, asked him to move and he called her a bad word in second-grade\
  \ Korean. Within minutes the whole classroom had burst into tears. I could only\
  \ watch this unfold with horror. \n\nWhen Hyunju came in, they were still a mess.\
  \ She stammered and them and one of the kids offered an explanation. Hyunju nodded\
  \ in sympathy.\n\n\u201CWell?\u201D I asked.\n\n\u201CIt\u2019s Billy,\u201D she\
  \ said. \u201CHe stole the special seat.\u201D\n\n\u201CBut this is crazy,\u201D\
  \ I said, \u201Ctell them there is no special seat. Tell them every seat is special.\u201D\
  \n\nHyunju spoke with them again. \u201CThey say you are wrong,\u201D she said.\
  \ \u201CThere can only ever be one special seat.\u201D  \n\nHyunju admitted she\
  \ was kind of guessing here. She was Korean, but she could not interpret the foreign\
  \ logic of a second-grader.\n\n\u201CHmmmm,\u201D I thought. \u201CWell, tell them,\
  \ that yes, the seat is special, and today Tommy gets it, but starting tomorrow\
  \ I will put their names in a hat for the special seat. By the end of the month,\
  \ everyone will get a chance.\u201D\n\nThe kids thought this system was very fair.\
  \ The next day I brought a hat. They had already forgotten about the special seat\
  \ completely."
