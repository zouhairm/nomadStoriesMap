Text: "It was not the constant reminder that, at the time, he used drugs and that\
  \ he calls himself the \u201CAcid rapper\u201D, nor was it the fact that he has\
  \ the cutest smile that matches his big, beautiful, inviting and dark brown eyes\
  \ so perfectly. It was his lyrics.  It was the raw, yet, peaceful timbre of his\
  \ golden voice that made me fall unapologetically in love with Chance the Rapper.\n\
  Chancellor Johnathan Bennett, is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, record\
  \ producer, an actor and above all a father. Of course, my first trip abroad was\
  \ to see him perform in concert. The West Chatham neighbourhood of Chicago, Illinois\
  \ felt like a homecoming. As I elbowed my way through the throngs of ardent fans,\
  \ to the one place I needed to be. The Golden circle. A mere, meter away from my\
  \ musical demi-god. In fact, I was so close I could see the beads of sweat on his\
  \ brow, as what seemed like thousands of watts of bright stage lights trained on\
  \ him and illuminated the face which haunts my dreams. The Soldier Field, usually\
  \ the venue for American football fanatics, erupted into a frenzy when he belted\
  \ out what was at the time, the top selling song on radio stations across continental\
  \ America, United Kingdom and Asia. \nWhen he sang \u201CHey Ma\u201D he looked\
  \ right at me. I nearly died. He didn\u2019t just look at me. He stared into my\
  \ soul. So intense was the moment, that I was oblivious to the commotion surrounding\
  \ me. Men in shiny black uniforms had made their way to where I was standing, mesmerised.\
  \ They pulled at my arm, motioning towards the stage. \nWhat was going on? What\
  \ did they want from me?  \nBefore I knew it I was being spirited towards my lifelong\
  \ fantasy. Sixteen steps. Sound monitors. Backstage crew. A few whispered instructions\
  \ from a guy wearing a headpiece. And before I could truly grasp the meaning of\
  \ all this. I was standing beside him. His sculpted arm stretched out to me\u2026\
  \ \n\u201CWhat is your name ma\u2019am?\u201D he asked.\nLater that night, on a\
  \ VIP backstage pass, Chance, as I now get to call him, because we are, like friends,\
  \ told me how rap has changed the trajectory of his life. \nI told him how his music\
  \ had changed mine.\nAs the night wore on, and someone popped his latest single\
  \ into the music player, I could feel my body moving in unison with the beat.\n\
  From across the room I could feel a pair of eyes burning into my skin. I looked\
  \ up to an approving smile which, by the way could sell toothpaste by the truckload.\n\
  \u201CWill you consider dancing in my upcoming music video?\u201D he mouthed. \n\
  It was the last thing I expected\u2026"
