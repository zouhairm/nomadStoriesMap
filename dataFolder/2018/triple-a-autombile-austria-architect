Text: "My friend Peter only speaks English professionally. We met when networking\
  \ through my graduate school friends, and then I visited him in his region of birth\
  \ and current residence. Peter acted in a familar way to how my family interacts\
  \ with each other. A little cold, a little dry and sarcastic, a little too exact;\
  \ Or, Austrian. He was born in the area of Italy that was Austria before World War\
  \ II, so he learned to speak German before experiencing the culture of southern\
  \ Italy as a child. It's a huge contrast stereotypically to Americans, but nevertheless\
  \ not impossible to reconcile. \n\nHe and I found that the mundane linguistics to\
  \ translate were just as interesting as going to a museum together.\n\nI stayed\
  \ with him in Z\xFCrich where we explored the region together. But, before it was\
  \ over, Peter taught me how to drive a stick shift car. Or, I should say, I conveniently\
  \ neglect to tell him I had never driven a stick shift before and and he threw unbelievably\
  \ angry hand gestures at me while I messed up the clutch. Never utter a bad word,\
  \ and yet I was scolded for three hours.\n\nI'm any case, we went to the parking\
  \ lot of the ETH Campus, where I was blown away by the contemporary landscape architecture.\
  \ Nothing to do with neo-classical gardens, only tall wheat and water reed grasses\
  \ picking up a back lit halo of dark greens and warm browns. And I was driving like\
  \ an idiot through it.\n\nI kept lifting up the clutch too fast and Peter would\
  \ sigh and then hang his head. He made an aerodynamic fin with his hand, pushing\
  \ through the air and muttering \"smooth\". Nothing negative, just factual. Finally\
  \ it started becoming second nature and I was accelerating from rest in an uphill\
  \ road. Not quite a pro, but we were moving!\n\nWe took to the highway to drive\
  \ to Peter Zumthor's museum at the border of Austria. A minimal concrete shell with\
  \ a sand blasted facade and ambient light interior. It was gorgeous, cold, clean,\
  \ and a soft backstop to more abstract paintings. Peter and I spoke very simple\
  \ sentences to each other considering that we were using exact language of our profession.\
  \ Translating language that describes art is particularly colorful, but makes more\
  \ sense in Italian. Peter translated Italian critiques of minimalism to me. It was\
  \ subtle and existential: the language of a culture that had Da Vinci and Michelangelo\
  \ with commissions from the Vatican. It was an unbelievable ride.\n\nIt was more\
  \ believable though when Peter suggested that he drive us back to Z\xFCrich."
