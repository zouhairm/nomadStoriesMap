Text: "One time, my girlfriend Mina drove our rental car into a sandpit about 15 miles\
  \ into the Baja California desert. We were celebrating our one-year anniversary\
  \ with a road trip that began at the US border, starting in Tijuana and working\
  \ our way 600 miles down the coast of the peninsula. \n\nOnce you leave Ensenada,\
  \ it takes a day or two to arrive at the next closest thing to civilization, a coastal\
  \ town called Bah\xEDa de los Angeles\u2014population 800. There's not much in between\
  \ but giant Martian rocks and cacti the size of hundred-year-old trees. \n\nWe had\
  \ dinner\u2014grilled scallops with cold beer\u2014at a hotel restaurant in Bah\xED\
  a, joined by a gaggle of drunk German tourists who arrived in a van together. At\
  \ one point the waitress mentioned a 17th-century mission at the top of a mountain\
  \ nearby, which is how we ended up stranded in the desert. \n\nShe said it was a\
  \ 40-minute drive, which it wasn't. It was two hours up hill on a dirt road peppered\
  \ with rocks the size of small dogs. Mina and I got a tour of the church from a\
  \ round teenage girl in pink sweatpants, who emerged from the ranch next door when\
  \ we drove up.\n\nInside it was dark and cool, with only a few rays of dry light\
  \ coming through the tan walls. The chapel itself was small, with eight rows of\
  \ fold-up benches and a simple altar. They only use it once a year for the celebration\
  \ of Saint Francisco, where six or seven hundred people come from the surrounding\
  \ villages and party for three days straight without sleeping. They set up taco\
  \ stands and tents in the parking lot and hire big bass brands to play all through\
  \ the night.\n\nMina drove the way back, and we were doing fine for 20 minutes or\
  \ so, smoking cigarettes out the window and gazing at the forest of tall spiky fingers.\
  \ Just when I had begun to relax, the nose of our car plunged downwards and we stopped\
  \ with a powdery thud. The engine whined as Mina pumped the accelerator, but the\
  \ wheels spun without sinking their teeth into anything.\n\nWe walked for five punishing\
  \ hours before a truck finally passed in the distance. Mina ran ahead, shouting\
  \ and waving her arms like a shipwreck survivor, but it ducked behind a hill and\
  \ disappeared in a cloud of dust. Just as we were about to give up it reappeared,\
  \ moving in reverse from around the bend. \n\n\"Thank goodness my wife saw you back\
  \ there,\" the driver said. \"We wouldn't usually pick anybody up off the side of\
  \ the road. You never know what kind of person you might meet out here, but you\
  \ all must be tourists, right?\""
