Text: "Nothing but a Smile\nDate: Mid-August 2013.\nLocation: Managua, Nicaragua.\n\
  What: The Last Thing I Expected\n\n Bodies were all around me, I stared with awestruck\
  \ wonder, letting the hum of the world buzz above my head, grappling for words I\
  \ called familiar. \n Culture shock. Something I did not even know existed.\n I\
  \ never expected to feel so extrinsic. I honestly do not know what I was expecting.\
  \ It was my first experience as a minority. My first experience being in a position\
  \ where I could not fully communicate.\n It was a short-term mission trip. We were\
  \ presented with an opportunity to volunteer with \u201CTesoros de Dios,\u201D (Treasures\
  \ of God). It is a non-profit organization that helps encourage the development\
  \ of children with disabilities, as well as working with their family members, schools,\
  \ and communities. Children with disabilities in Nicaragua are often seen as a burden.\
  \ When a child is born with disabilities, typically, the family is abandoned by\
  \ the father and is shunned by the community, leaving the mother alone. \n While\
  \ there, I was able to assist with maintenance around the building, as well as the\
  \ opportunity to participate in the therapy sessions for these children. I was able\
  \ to learn about different activities, exercises, and actually apply these new skills.\
  \ I was specifically working with children who have Cerebral Palsy; we used texture\
  \ brushes and balls as objects to stimulate sensory, and helped encourage movement\
  \ by stretching and guiding their legs. I could not communicate with them verbally,\
  \ but I will never forget the bright smiles on their faces, which I mirrored. We\
  \ could communicate with laughter and smiles, happiness is transmitted the same\
  \ in all languages.\nAfter the culture shock, I was not expecting to feel full of\
  \ admiration and awe for the world around me."
