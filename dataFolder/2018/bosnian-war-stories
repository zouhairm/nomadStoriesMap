Text: "Walking around Mostar, I passed countless crumbling buildings with bullet holes\
  \ in the walls. An eight-storey building - once a bank, then a sniper tower - was\
  \ now in even worse condition than it was during the war: all the windows smashed\
  \ and gone, walls covered in street art, huge amounts of rubbish piling up throughout.\
  \ Before I even heard the stories, the town itself told the tale of a country still\
  \ recovering from a devastating war.\n\nLooking down at Mostar from Hum Mountain,\
  \ I sat with Zika, a tall, broad man in his early 40s who was only sixteen when\
  \ the war began. We sat by an old bunker, the exact spot where the Croatian soldiers\
  \ shot and killed many Bosnians, both soldiers and civilians. This was the perfect\
  \ vantage point over the town. He sat in the same place that his war enemies once\
  \ occupied while he told his war stories.\n\nZika\u2019s high school class was an\
  \ eclectic mixture of cultures, in which Bosnians and Croatians worked and played\
  \ together quite happily. But then the war began and everything changed. When he\
  \ turned seventeen he left school to join the resistance. His friends became his\
  \ enemies. He fought with and against his classmates, and witnessed many of them\
  \ dying. He was shot twice. He saw his home, his neighbourhood and his city destroyed.\n\
  \nStaring down at Mostar, he explained how the effects of the war are still present\
  \ around Bosnia today. Even twenty-odd years after the war ended, there is still\
  \ conflict between the east and the west. Many living on the west side of the river\
  \ identify as Croatian. On this side of town, ordering a Bosnian beer is a risky\
  \ request, regarded as an insult by the Croatians and therefore likely to provoke\
  \ a fight.\n\nOn top of this, there are masses of mines still buried just off the\
  \ roads and paths. I shivered as Zika emphasised how important it was to always\
  \ stay on a marked path, and I asked why there were no warning signs. He shrugged\
  \ and said that bright red skull-and-cross-bone signs were put up all the time \u2013\
  \ but tourists kept stealing them for souvenirs, carelessly putting people\u2019\
  s lives at risk.\n\nZika\u2019s stories taught me more about the Bosnian war than\
  \ I could ever learn from a museum or a book. His stories, so raw and real, happened\
  \ in my lifetime; it could have been me who lived through this, rather than him.\
  \ Talking to Zika made me realise just how fortunate I am to have grown up in a\
  \ peaceful, war-free country. I never had to fight for my right to be Australian,\
  \ it is simply a privilege I was born with."
