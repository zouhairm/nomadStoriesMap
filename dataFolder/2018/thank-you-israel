Text: "It was my ability to look into the lowest elevation on land from the Masada\
  \ Fortress that made me realize travelling is the place I want to be. I never expected\
  \ Israel to give me that answer, because it was a spontaneous trip that I decided\
  \ to go on two months before departure. The reality did not hit me until I was on\
  \ the plane eating Israeli food, watching an orthodox Jew standing in the corner\
  \ by the plane bathroom praying. The woman I was sitting next to on the plane smiled\
  \ at me, and said \"Israelis put up a mean front, but they have big hearts\". This\
  \ was an idea I carried with me throughout the whole trip. The immersion into the\
  \ culture began when I tried to buy an iced coffee at the Ben Gurion airport in\
  \ Tel Aviv. I was given what Americans would call a \"Frappuccino\" and my credit\
  \ card and drink were slammed onto the table in front of me. I was not told \"have\
  \ a nice day\" or given the slightest smile, and I was okay with that. That interaction\
  \ showed me that people are not fake in Israel which I have never experienced from\
  \ an entire place. This was a theme throughout the whole trip, during our stay at\
  \ various hotels and cute bed and breakfasts, with lighter salads for breakfast\
  \ that gave me sufficient energy throughout the day. We began our visit with the\
  \ northernmost point of Israel and worked our way down the small country in ten\
  \ days. Visiting Metula was first on the itinerary and we were able to see the peaceful\
  \ town that borders Syria. That morning we woke up and went to look at the Syrian\
  \ border and experienced a transformed tourist destination that used to be an old\
  \ military bunker. Peering through binoculars into a country that is known as \"\
  war torn\" was bone chilling and gave me an entirely new perspective on how vast\
  \ the world is, and how many sides there are to every story. Israel is beautiful,\
  \ their history is incredible. Something one hundred years\u2019 old there is considered\
  \ young, and the best part about it is that they keep their history. From stargazing\
  \ in the desert to floating in the dead sea, I found my inner peace in Israel when\
  \ I was warned not to go by family and friends. Israel immersed me into the addicting\
  \ travel culture, it was my first trip out of the country and I left filled with\
  \ immense gratitude for the country that I will never replace in my heart. I was\
  \ able to find spirituality within myself, and it was truly the last thing I expected\
  \ to be happening to me at this early, important stage of my life. Thank you, Israel."
