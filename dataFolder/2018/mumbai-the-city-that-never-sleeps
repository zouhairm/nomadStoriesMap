Text: "There are a deluge of places to travel in the world, \nAmong those is a large\
  \ count which India would hold. \n\nIn India which is a land of diversities, \n\
  We have Mumbai, one of those  beautiful cities. \n\nMany clich\xE9s and travel blogs\
  \ will tell you a lot about it,\nBut these words will force you to live moments\
  \ there and not just to  visit. \n\nGetting up early in the morning,\nTrekking all\
  \ the way up to Sameer Hill. \nFor the beautiful sunrise and getting sun-kissed.\
  \ \n\nLeaving all your work, getting through the traffic rushing,\nFor the sunset\
  \ at Powai Lake, which you in no way want to miss. \n\nBeaches are loved by everybody.\
  \ \nHow about at Juhu Chawpati beach playing kabaddi? \nLiving the moment of 3am\
  \ at Marine drive, \nAnd listening the music of waves hitting the bricks is surely\
  \ life. \n\nMany newspaper articles covered candle marches at Gateway of India,\
  \ \nOr the attack of 26/11 at hotel Taj \nwhich shivered every nerve in India. \n\
  Visiting them be it day or night, \nIs no less than receiving goosebumps with every\
  \ sight. \n\nIf you're a foodie like me, \nthen these following lines are your \"\
  must be\". \nFor the love of spices, \nYou'll reach out to Golgappe at Hiranandani\
  \ and Bada pav at Juhu Chawpati, \nAnd definitely end up eating other delicacies\
  \ as well, with every head turn which will come up to you as surprises. \n\nMaking\
  \ a group with unknowns, though not always safe \nBut rewinding those slo-mo videos\
  \ of Mandwa beach I realise I was never unsafe.\n\nSome trips, some decisions are\
  \ purely  unplanned \nTrust me, they're worth knowing the feeling as they push \
  \ you to the edge."
