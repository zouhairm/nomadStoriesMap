Text: "The south of the northern-Western Iceland Fjords was exactly like I was promised...Astonishing,\
  \ Magnificent, a profound feeling to have arrived at the edge of the world.\nMountains\
  \ were hidden under thick clouds giving me the impression to drive towards heaven's\
  \ gates and cliffs that I've only seen once, in Ireland, worthy of a tragedy, the\
  \ kind of movie that shows a miserable poetic soul on the edge with her skirt flowing\
  \ in the wind, about to kill herself, it was that kind of cliffs. \nStill driving\
  \ on the dirt road, the weather was getting even worse since I was now into the\
  \ clouds, the fog was so dense, it felt like being in a pea soup but once I was\
  \ in its center, it was of a rather basic clarity for a rainy day. \nSurrounded\
  \ by fog, with a landscape deserted by all living beings, only an old USA navy plane\
  \ was there to keep me company but with every minute passing in this mysterious\
  \ landscape, I started to imagine some kind of mystic being living there, ready\
  \ to arise out of nowhere.\nContinuing my adventure down the dirt road of the fjord,\
  \ driving no faster than 20km otherwise I would have ended up at the bottom faster\
  \ than expected. Finally, down the road, the fog was gone and I found myself in\
  \ a small village, counting no more than ten houses and still not a living soul,\
  \ I kept on moving, rushing to get passed that ghost town, feeling quite uncomfortable\
  \ all alone. \nDown there I could see the cliffs I had driven on earlier with a\
  \ different point of view, when I was on them, they looked so dramatic, from below\
  \ they just looked ancients, like if now I was no longer in the Wuthering Heights\
  \ but instead I was in Jurassic Park. Everything around me was so wild and full\
  \ of colors, green mountains, red dirt, a grey sky and finally at the end of the\
  \ road a black painted church with a red roof, it wasn't surprising to see a church\
  \ in the middle of nowhere, after spending two weeks in Iceland, I had noticed that\
  \ they had Churches everywhere even in the most remote areas. But the last thing\
  \ I expected to find, behind that lonely church, was a wild orange sanded beach,\
  \ I had driven across many beaches in Iceland, mostly with dark sand, some of them\
  \ had yellow sand like the beaches in France but not orange sand, the kind of color\
  \ that should only be found in the desert...this place was surreal and lost in the\
  \ middle of nowhere, not a single person could be found in miles, I just continued\
  \ to walk until I could reach the ocean...I had found the edge of the world."
