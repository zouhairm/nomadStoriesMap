Text: "Gangelt,Germany is a small town, a village,you might say, a few restaurants,\
  \ the market everything you need is minutes away. The first weekend we arrived in\
  \ Germany we drove to Neustadt and toured the town, the Tavern was closed and run\
  \ down. Lunch at Roma's restaurant was good, wesaw Neustadt's landmark, the Junker\
  \ Hanson Turm,and on the road, neat drawings of Little Red Riding Hood. Not far\
  \ from Neustadt we drove up hill and saw the statue of Hercules,Below;the town of\
  \ Kassel among the trees. In Haarlem we had drinks at Koop's Caf\xE9,ended up hanging\
  \ out with the locals,it was a blast!I will admit we were a bit tired the next day.\
  \ In Amsterdam we took a ride on the canals,saw the city's highlights and Dam Square.\
  \ We missed out on the Red Light District; next time we are there. Monschau,Germany,a\
  \ cute town hidden away on the Eifel mountain top,that show cases the Haller Castle.\
  \ My favourite place in Germany,definitely worth a pit stop!Treir is the oldest\
  \ city in Germany and considered to be a \"Second Rome\". The Porta-Nigra-Platz\
  \ and the old Roman Gate. At night the city centre was dark,trip advisor suggestion,\"\
  Don't venture out late\".That night my friend lost her phone  the next day we searched\
  \ everywhere, no luck. We continued onto our next destination: Koln. We took a ride\
  \ on the Rhine, it was peaceful with a beautiful view. We sailed past the fishing\
  \ village of Rodenkirchen,the chocolate factory and the K\xF6lner Dom. A day in\
  \ Koln was not enough time,there was so much for us to see and do. After Koln we\
  \ headed back to my brothers,or at least we tried.Instead we got lost and took an\
  \ extra two hour train ride.We finally arrived in Gelsenkirchen,Germany supposed\
  \ to meet my brother in the parking lot,turns out he was in Geilenkirchen,Germany.\
  \ We were in the wrong spot.Geilenkirchen,Gelsenkirchen,who knew?Look at the spelling,there\u2019\
  s not a real difference in the name,when the German\u2019s says it sure sounds the\
  \ same. Oh yeah while we were purchased our train ticket in Koln,a wizard offered\
  \ us a ride home!\nBrussels city centre was filled with historic and charm,old buildings\
  \ mixed in with the new.It was sad to see how Belgium is effected by the attacks;\
  \ there were protest,military trucks parked in the street and soldiers carrying\
  \ rifles. Something we are not use to.We had an awesome time,with great hosts! Excellent\
  \ food,limo driver,comfortable place to stay.Spoiled you could say.I\u2019m already\
  \ planning my trip back,I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll even unpack."
