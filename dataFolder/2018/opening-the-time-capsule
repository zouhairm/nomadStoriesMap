Text: "I know what I expected by going to Cuba, days on beaches with mojitos and soft\
  \ guitar. I didn\u2019t think that was hard, I\u2019d been to the Caribbean before\
  \ and had hazy sunsets firmly in my brain. What I got instead was history and a\
  \ country in mourning.\n\nCuba is Communist, cut off from the world for 60 years.\
  \ It\u2019s been led over a lot of that time by Fidel Castro. Fidel is an icon.\
  \ He was one of the four Revolutionary leaders, the saviours of the Cuban people\
  \ from an oppressive dictatorship. The revolt shaped Cuba and is constantly referred\
  \ to in literature, pop culture and architecture. I\u2019ve always been interested\
  \ in Communism and seeing what\u2019s preserved in Cuba\u2019s time capsule. But\
  \ what would\u2019ve been an abstract look at the Revolution and its impacts became\
  \ a firsthand lesson in Cuban nationalism. How? Fidel Castro died the day before\
  \ I landed in Havana. I sauntered into Cuba expecting beaches, but found a funeral\
  \ procession.\n\nWhile this may seem gloomy, it showed me sides of the country that\
  \ most never see. I spent time immersed in Cuba\u2019s grief; strong and proud.\
  \ There were official rules like no alcohol in restaurants and no music or public\
  \ shows, but what impacted me were the private efforts to absorb a massive event.\
  \ Most households were covered in national flags, flags of the Revolution and banners\
  \ bearing Fidel\u2019s face \u2013 as a public display of pride.\n\nThe clearest\
  \ moment was when I visited the Plaza de la Revolucion in Havana. It was hot, the\
  \ kind of heat that rises off pavement in a shimmer. Despite this, tens of thousands\
  \ of Cubans were queuing to say their last farewells to Fidel. His funeral procession\
  \ was travelling through the country but it started here. These people appeared\
  \ to come from all walks of life; there were old, young, office workers, labourers,\
  \ students, retirees, anyone you can think of. However, one woman got to me. An\
  \ elderly lady standing in the heat sans protection, clasping flowers for Fidel\u2019\
  s memorial. It was so poignant, her quiet grief. To contrast (showing the different\
  \ way people react), students were nearby chanting and carrying banners saying Somos\
  \ Fidel, We Are Fidel. Coming from an apathetic nation, I\u2019d never seen nationalism\
  \ like this.\n\nCuban society was irrevocably changed. Raul Castro leads the nation,\
  \ but he\u2019s the last of the revolutionaries and is 86. The USA have opened trade\
  \ with Cuba and more enterprise is allowed. Soon Cuba won\u2019t be such a time\
  \ capsule and I\u2019m grateful that I walked into a moment in history."
