Text: "This is Shubham Srivastava, when  I was a child, I often used to dream of traveling\
  \ the world and seeing the beauty of nature. If I got a chance to travel the world\
  \ then it will be a tremendous and life time opportunity for me. I am really very\
  \ fascinated about traveling new places, I really want to live every culture of\
  \ every country in my life, because I'm dynamic. \nI want to feel every culture\
  \ with my heart and want to explore it. I always use to think about that when I\
  \ will get a stand in my life, i will get an identity in my life. I will definitely\
  \ travel the world with my money. This is my life time dream and i can't let myself\
  \ stop to do traveling. \n              I have traveled many places like Pokhara(Nepal),\
  \ Kathmandu(Nepal), Lumbini (Nepal), Varanasi  (India), Lucknow (India ). All of\
  \ these places were very beautiful and cultural,  I really wanted to get dissolve\
  \ in every of these cultures.\n                                                \
  \           Traveling and visiting new places is like heaven to me because this\
  \ is the sole thing which I love to do the most anytime, because It give me peace\
  \ and enjoyment. I'm kind of very peaceful person as I believe that any matter and\
  \ quarrel can be solved by negotiation.\n                  The places that I traveled\
  \ was very attractive   because I saw different people are coming from different\
  \ countries. I also love to make friends from different countries because i get\
  \ to know their perception and their culture and many more thing about them and\
  \ it really makes me excited to know about people from different originity. \n \
  \                                                           I have had friends from\
  \ Holland and Israel we have visited most of the historical places in Lucknow together,\
  \ they were very gentle and I really wanted  to know about them and their thinking\
  \ and i found that they were very fascinated about traveling, so i got to know many\
  \ thing about them.\n                    All I know is to travel the world and see\
  \ the beauty of nature because life is all about enjoyment and fun so do the things\
  \ which makes you happy but in a positive. There are also many places around me\
  \ which I wil travel in future and it's all in my hand because I'm working on my\
  \ dreams, so i have the confidence that one day i will definately make my this dream\
  \ come true. Thanks for giving me the tremendous opportunity to write this article\
  \ about my perception towards traveling."
