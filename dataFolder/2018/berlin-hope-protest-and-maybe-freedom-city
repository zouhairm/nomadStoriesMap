Text: "All want to be modern, luxurious and it is not really bad until we became one\
  \ big fiction. It seems, that Berlin more than any other European capital faces\
  \ two worlds - modern and authentic, yet sure, but almost forgotten. He is still\
  \ there, the alternative, just hidden in the corner. The latter reminds me freedom,\
  \ although I do not know what means capacity. \n\nMercedes Benz\u2019s with its\
  \ maybe ten-story building and other commercial gods are flocking into Keuzberg\
  \ area. Punks, metal heads, artists go to the corner. They transform streets into\
  \ museums of minds and ideas. It faces you against the world, not painted, but real\
  \ and helps to perceive human weakness. That how I saw Berlin at the very first\
  \ time. That still is capable to resist the king of capitalism. \n\nAnd the Berlin\
  \ Wall. Now called the \u201CEast side gallery\u201D \u2013 a piece of stone lasting\
  \ a half of kilometers with a million meanings. During the Cold War it was a real\
  \ wall between two ideologies. The artists\u2019 drawings make you comfused because\
  \ at least half of drawings look just beautiful and all the meanings are hidden\
  \ behind the history and experience of Berliners. \n\nAnd Berlin is immense. In\
  \ fact, one of the biggest cities in Europe. But not only in the map. One moment\
  \ it looks really clear and the second moment you are confused. But architecture\
  \ and public transport create a sustainable framework. Metro. Trains. Trams. Buses.\
  \ Wherever you need. But complicated question is what you need. During some days\
  \ I did not understand where the center of the city is here, and where to go and\
  \ take a look into the bar or cafe place. I suppose, Berliners still can\u2019t\
  \ answer to this question too. Also windy looking for the cappuccino and piece of\
  \ chocolate cake became a kind of memorable part of the trip. To saying true, we\
  \ did not find a genuine German food. We tasted Italian, Spanish, Asian cuisine,\
  \ however found German \"holes\". All without pomposities with snippets of freedom\
  \ smell. \n\nFrom the last evening. \nGerman inn. Something like serious men place\
  \ as from the movies. Music is hanging on the wall. A guitar, a ukulele, a harmonica,\
  \ a mandolin, a tub, a clarinet. On the table in the waxy bottle of whisky is almost\
  \ burned candle. Smell of the smoke reaches every piece of your body. \n\nAnd now\
  \ I\u2018m stealing my friend minds that it\u2019s really scary to forget what I\u2018\
  ve seen, it is scary to fall into the hole of vanity and laziness.  So let\u2019\
  s remember the advice of amazing guide Brian Bell: \"Travel. Read. Vote.\u201D"
