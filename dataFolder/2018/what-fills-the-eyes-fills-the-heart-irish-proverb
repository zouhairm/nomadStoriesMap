Text: Ever wondered what it's like to go on a real adventure into the unknown?With
  a lot fun,sweat and well held back tears?For me it was Puducherry or Pondy a place
  where new age meets the Old world.Also Auroville which draws a large number of spiritually
  minded vistors.I was with my travel mates.Only meriting a brief mention in my South
  india guidebook,it sounded ideal for a weekend of adventure.It was a 21 hrs express
  train journey,what i have found is the journey is something that brings the real
  pleasure before arriving to your destination.The travel period was of 10 days.At
  9:00 pm we arrived at a hotel in chennai and using a local travel bus we headed
  to pondicherry the next day seeking the joys of coming to a totally new place enjoying
  the spectacular views of unadulterated countryside waiting for new stories to get
  added into our memories we reached pondicherry in 2 hrs.We checked in into a hotel
  and after that we headed to explore the seductive vision of the French subcontinental
  aesthetics,enhanced by gallic creative types and indian artists and designers.Being
  an architecture student it always intrests me to know the history of that place
  and to how can it take back us to what is lost.We visited different temples,monuments
  and local streets and than we engulfed ourselves to the spiritual aura of auroville
  where in one can find his/her soul amidst nature.We stayed with locals for a day
  to experience their lifestyle and to vibe on a similar scale.Sadhana Forest in auroville
  where in people from all parts of the world come together for community living leaving
  "Moh maya" behind and finding their inner peace and we experience it.Leaving out
  without phones and not knowing the local language we vowed each other to make the
  most of the day.On that day we got the ticket to Matri mandir the place for solace
  is what i call that humongous structure.Getting inside it,feeling the eternal peace
  and meditating along with 25 other people inside the huge globe without hearing
  a single sound made me realise how tiny a human being is.Our throbbing hearts was
  somehow audible to our ears and at that moment when the real peace hit me into existence
  i realised what being alive feels like and drop of tear fell out on my cheek making
  my mind ponder for sounds.Thiswas the end of the journey and after leaving that
  place we did'nt utter a word to ourselves but left with a heartwarming smiles knowing
  that its worth living.
