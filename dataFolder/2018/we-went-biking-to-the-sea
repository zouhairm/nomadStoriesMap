Text: "We went biking to the sea last year.\n How do you feel now when everything\
  \ disappears, I wondered? \n- That's something you just dreamed of.\n - I feel great\
  \ when I give it. Satisfied.  Completely, I answered.\nI'm trying to wonder why\
  \ I dreamed it or we really did go biking to the sea. Spontaneously embedded group.\
  \ Ideal for four. Two guys, two girls, four friends, four bikes, from Ni\u0161 to\
  \ Greece, countless particles of wonderful energy. And the chaos of beautiful things,\
  \ moments, tears, laughter, desired desires, new plans, proven goals. \nYes, we\
  \ went biking to the sea and we were kings who did not give up even when they realized\
  \ that the summit of the hill had its peak. And we did not stop hoping that right\
  \ after the next curve, climbing would be good, although this is not the last ten\
  \ mistakes.\n We tested our limits and the power of our will. We tested the desire.\
  \ We tested it and laid it down. We had a close encounter with a jeep and stopped\
  \ in a spy house. On some rises, the truck lasted five minutes to walk us, while\
  \ the driver was blurred with his head holding his foot on the gas. Slowly make\
  \ a man fall apart, but he does not do it for you. We slept with tattoo writers,\
  \ in the home of a childhood parent, in a trailer for a wagon. They went through\
  \ crops, hills and plains, basketball, streams, estuaries, narrow bridges. We were\
  \ gourds of genuine, goat and cow cheese, various natural particles were discovered,\
  \ and often with the first darkness, such as buried babies. \nThe vehicles smiled,\
  \ crushed, waved, jumped at the break and did not chew enough food. They talked\
  \ to each other in their heads, tired of their tired will, and strength and body\
  \ were reduced in lines and challenges, brakes were extended. In the head you count\
  \ the right foot pedal four times, then press the left foot four times, then drag\
  \ it, but drag it, then a few more miracles than three, but the point is always\
  \ the same, that is, in love with bikes and bikes, they never cleaned .\n Pain pains\
  \ drank, circulated the circulation, and rotated the different force of the wheels.\
  \ They pushed the other, massaged, a little suddenly, cheering, yelling, behind\
  \ the curves they were waiting for. Bicycles changed, together slowly climbed. \n\
  It's important to have a good team, capture your environment and absorb impressions,\
  \ play ringtones, and keep track of traffic regulations on the road. \nI met this\
  \ morning in a mirror and a smile with a great voice that reflected this, we walked\
  \ by bicycle to the sea."
