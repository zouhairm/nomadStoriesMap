Text: "Intro:\nAfter ten days traveling throughout Cuba, I now sit in a warm humid\
  \ breeze outside the airport furiously writing as I await my flight home not wanting\
  \ to forget a single memory. During the short forty-five minute flight to Florida,\
  \ I know that I will be looking back upon my journey more than looking forward to\
  \ my arrival home. Prior to this adventure Cuba was an anomaly to me \u2013 an unknown\
  \ land full of mystery, intrigue and bold historical headlines. With an embargo\
  \ placed upon the island for nearly sixty years by the United States during the\
  \ JFK administration, travel to Cuba was prohibitive, although not entirely off\
  \ limits. Today, as I bite into my last jam\xF3n y queso sandwich (which became\
  \ a staple of my diet here mostly because of its simplicity and reliability across\
  \ the country) I am overwhelmed by feelings of gratitude that I was able to travel\
  \ to and better understand our Caribbean neighbor ninety miles off the coast of\
  \ Florida.\n\n \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Though much is \u201Cknown\u201D about Cuba to Americans,\
  \ including personalities such as Fidel Castro and Che Guevara and events such as\
  \ the Bay of Pigs, Cuban missile crisis, and of course the trade embargo, I for\
  \ one knew very little about local daily life on the island. It was only by walking\
  \ the busy streets of Havana, riding horses through the tobacco farms of Vi\xF1\
  ales, wandering the cobblestone steps of Trinidad and speaking with the locals did\
  \ I begin to understand the many realities of Cuban life and what Americans can\
  \ learn from this proud and lively island nation. With every step I was able to\
  \ feel and experience that which did not exist in my backyard and after a long week\
  \ in Cuba, I have learned much and better understand both the pros and cons of our\
  \ self-imposed economic and cultural embargo.\n\n\_ The first thing I realized about\
  \ Cuba is that it\u2019s full of music. Be it the melody of children\u2019s voices\
  \ at play, the shouts from friends and family members calling to one another over\
  \ the rumble of American muscle purring \u2013 or clunking \u2013 their way down\
  \ the narrow streets, Cuba provides visitors with a chorus of culture.  From day\
  \ one it was the power of music that drew us from bar to bar, restaurant to plaza\
  \ and from ignorance to appreciation...\n\nThe remainder of this story talks about\
  \ how I meet a local tour guide and we exchange more cultural information on Cuba\
  \ and highlights of my trip in order to educate more people to the current conditions\
  \ in Cuba and how they can support the Cuban people."
