Text: "1(2) 12(3) 45(6)... This is how it all started. The first evening in Sevilla\
  \ we went to watch flamenco in a Museum of Flamenco. A long queue has formed before\
  \ the show. We were the first in the line. The manager started to ask usual questions\
  \ about our country of origin, our professions. This neat small man was delighted\
  \ to learn I was a daycare. \"It's a great profession, and a very important one.\
  \ As they say, don't give children milk. Give them love.\" Then he did something\
  \ that opened up a real spanish character to me. He showed me and my boyfriend the\
  \ basic castanets rythm. 1(2) 12(3) He clapped his hands and at the same time was\
  \ explaining the best rythm to make love, so that both of partners take the most\
  \ of it. After a while, sitting in a dansing hall right before the stage, I could\
  \ feel the long skirt of a female danser (bailaora) on my face every time she made\
  \ a move from one side of the stage to another, and see the bodies of a man and\
  \ a woman swaying, I realized it's more than a dance for them. It's passion that\
  \ gets you to the edge. Spaniards call it 'duende'. \nAnother time that we could\
  \ feel the true spirit of Spain was during the hike to the caves of the gypsies\
  \ in Granada. Miles had a birthday and I though that an unusual excursion could\
  \ be a great gift. I have heard stories about gypsies before but never met them,\
  \ so we both were excited. First part of this hike was usual, we got some facts\
  \ about history of the town, going higher and higher. When we passed about 4 kilometers,\
  \ the first caves started to appear.  Modern time gypsies lived there - in the caves\
  \ made in the rocks, with no central heating, running water, often no electricity.\
  \ Our guide who in the same time was their friend said that there lived unregistered\
  \ gypsies who refused to pay taxes and voluntarily did without modern conveniences\
  \ to stay free and independent. Inside of one of the caves that we were let in,\
  \ were several rooms, very simply furnished, a \"kitchen\" around the fire. But\
  \ what was most exciting is their living rooms: just chairs on the edge of the hill\
  \ with perfect vista at a lights lit citadel.\nTHey treated us with Moroccan coffee\
  \ (most of the modern gypsies are from this country) and we went deeper into the\
  \ wood to see another rock with a cave that someone had just started to carve. Our\
  \ guide Enrike said that this person secretly comes every night to little by little\
  \ create the new cave. This is Spain how it is - free and deep, when you are looking\
  \ for it."
