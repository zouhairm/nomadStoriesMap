Text: "When I set off for Crete, I hadn't expected I'd ever find myself in this situation.\
  \ But here I am, in a rented Hyundai Elantra with four relative strangers I'd befriended\
  \ over an Easter meal, on a Greek island known for its snow-capped mountains and\
  \ stunning beaches...and we're perched on the edge of a mountain road, stuck. \n\
  \nThis morning, Alex, the gruff, though kind, Bulgarian running our hostel in sunny\
  \ Rethymno, had insisted we visit Argiroupoli, a mountain village in central Crete\
  \ known for its avocados and honey. Satiated on Argiroupoli's best, we had hopped\
  \ back in the car ready for the rest of the trip south to the beachfront village\
  \ of Plakias. \n\nAnd now I've found myself with only one option: To reverse a car\
  \ full of people around a sharp corner, along a cliffside road barely wide enough\
  \ for our car, without even a metal barrier to keep us in place.\n\nMuch of the\
  \ drive is uneventful, but an ill-advised turn has put us on a path made more for\
  \ farm equipment than for sedans. I have one foot glued to the breaks, as the road\
  \ slopes downward so steeply the gas pedal is rendered useless. My hands cling tightly\
  \ to the steering wheel as I try my best to keep the car from either scraping along\
  \ the rocky wall to my right or plunging off the cliff cutting straight down to\
  \ my left. At the base of the hill is a tight turn and, immediately, a makeshift\
  \ bridge across a dry river bed. Past the bridge comes an equally narrow road, this\
  \ time sloping upward at a horrifying angle. Deep potholes threaten to rip the bumpers\
  \ off the car. The top of the hill brings us to yet another hairpin turn and, finally,\
  \ to where the road is blocked, inexplicably, by a metal barrier.\n\nBy this point,\
  \ the three Americans in the back are all in varying states of distress, and, confusingly,\
  \ the Australian girl next to me is chattering away about how this reminds her of\
  \ a friend's driveway. \"It's a fun drive!\" she says. Maybe, but this one isn't.\
  \ We've got some hair-raising back-tracking to do if we want to (a) remain alive\
  \ and (b) ever return the car.\n\nEven in the moment, it's clear this'll probably\
  \ make for an entertaining story one day, but now, acutely aware that there is no\
  \ handing-off of this situation to an expert, and that one shaky move could send\
  \ us flying into a remote Cretan gorge, there's no room for self-doubt. Completely\
  \ disconnected from the world beyond this little Hyundai and these four people,\
  \ I have to make a decision. How do we get out of here? I decide, and I drive."
