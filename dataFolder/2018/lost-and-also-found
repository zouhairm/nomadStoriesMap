Text: "\u201CWhat I find strange,\u201D Stephen says, \u201Cis that no-one has tried\
  \ to sell us anything for ages.\u201D\n\nHe was right. Vietnam had been a barrage\
  \ of trinkets, postcards and refreshments since we arrived, and in Sapa this was\
  \ only topped by embroidery. I suspected we might be lost. A bridge of three bamboo\
  \ stalks made to cross a 20-metre drop over a white-water rampage was a dead giveaway.\
  \ We had watched in awe as three Dao ladies, baskets on their backs, crossed the\
  \ wobbling bamboo.\n\nThat was the other thing. The few people we had seen were\
  \ highlanders.\n\nAvoiding the bridge we took another path. Traversing the slippery\
  \ narrow hillside paths alongside vast steep valleys, my thoughts of death were\
  \ quelled by the ruggedly divine landscape. Our breaths taken, we proceeded\u2014\
  captivated by the lush vegetation, and marvelling at this light stroll that had\
  \ eclipsed our expectations.\n\nBut now the path had unexpectedly stopped. Cascading\
  \ before us were rice paddies, guarded by a water buffalo. \n\nThe tourist office\
  \ had advised that this was an easy, no-map-or-water required hour stroll before\
  \ dinner. But that was three hours ago, now we wandered adrift in impending darkness.\n\
  \nIn the distance some Hmong boys play by a chicken coup. We wave. \u201CHello.\
  \ Which way is it back to town? Is it this way?\u201D I point past the rice paddies.\
  \ They smile and nod. \u201C...Or is it this way?\u201D I point back to the way\
  \ we came. They smile and nod. \u201CWhich way is it?\u201D I bid, as they continue\
  \ to smile and nod.\n\n\u201CIf we get to the top of that hill, we might be able\
  \ to see the way back to town.\u201D suggests Stephen. \u201CIf not, we could sleep\
  \ in the chicken coup.\u201D\n\nWe trudge along the muddy edge of the rice paddies,\
  \ and upward through indigo fields. Higher and higher we climb, each hill leading\
  \ to another. Yet the altitude reveals nothing and the mist arrives challenging\
  \ our visibility. Tired and disheartened we consider the chicken coup.\n\nBut up\
  \ at the top of the hill is the last thing I expected. On a rock sits a Hmong boy\
  \ of about 8. We climb towards him, \u201CHello. Do you know the way back to town?\u201D\
  \ He points to himself and holds up five fingers. In a stroke of entrepreneurial\
  \ genius, he leads us out of the highlands to hitch a perilous three-person cliff-side\
  \ ride on a dirt bike.\n\nBack at the hotel we reflect, and vow to create space\
  \ on our travels for the unexpected\u2014both the good and the bad\u2014agreeing\
  \ these lead to the most treasured moments.\n\n\u201CThough,\u201D laughs Stephen,\
  \ \u201Cthat is the best five bucks I\u2019ve ever spent.\u201D"
