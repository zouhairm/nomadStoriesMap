Text: "The dawn is gray and wet in Kathmandu. I sip a cappuccino on a plush couch\
  \ in a warm cafe. My friend, Mike, tramps in clutching two trekking permits. \n\n\
  \u201CWe don\u2019t need a guide!\u201D he exclaims.\n\nWe sling our 70-pound backpacks\
  \ in a tuk-tuk and drive to a nearby market in search of a bus headed north. Mike\
  \ buys wild red bananas and clutches them like pure gold. They taste like fruit\
  \ punch. We climb on top of a bus and perch next to eight Nepali teenagers who smoke\
  \ cigarettes as I take their photograph.\n\nAt sunrise, we continue on foot looking\
  \ to hitch a ride to Langtang Valley. We lift our thumbs high and four stoic Tibetans\
  \ oblige our tacit request. We arrive at a suspension bridge covered in faded prayer\
  \ flags and begin our Himalayan trek.\n\nThe first two hours of this strenuous hike\
  \ nearly kills my spirit. The incline is steep, the bamboo forest is dense, and\
  \ my water supply runs low.  We build momentum and arrive in Sherpagaon by sunset.\
  \ The jade mountain ridges fold around the sleepy village.\n\nA one-legged man,\
  \ leaning on a crutch, beckons us to follow. He strides long and fast down the narrow\
  \ mountain path. We stay in his terrace farm for the night and meet his wife, twice\
  \ his size. She cooks a spicy Thukpa, a vegetable stew.\n\nIn the morning, we walk\
  \ in peaceful solitude. Every abandoned town that we cross magnifies our isolation.\
  \ We examine the \u201Cfamous\u201D Lama Hotel and find it has no ceiling. The sky\
  \ dims and I doubt our reckless ambition to hike without a Sherpa. We need food\
  \ and shelter.\n\nA distant orange glow flickers from a shack window. We knock and\
  \ pay a young woman for food and lodging. We eat; she fingers prayer beads and recites\
  \ the buddhist mantra Om Mani Padme Hum. Her cadence is broken by an occasional\
  \ snort of powdered tobacco and the tremble of tears streaming down her cheeks.\
  \ Her husband was buried in the earthquake six months ago. We sleep in a tent outside,\
  \ our night is restless and our backsides numb.\n\nThe following day, we navigate\
  \ a white rubble field that was once the Langtang village. Aid workers pry away\
  \ rocks and tell us that they uncovered human remains the day before. Finally, we\
  \ complete our ascent and arrive in Kyanjin Gompa.\n\nI sit in front of a glacier\
  \ and a brooke trickles next to my foot. A yak calf grazes on golden wheat and a\
  \ Himalayan vulture glides between jagged ice peaks. I am proud but weary. I cannot\
  \ read or write in this altitude but I can observe. The blend of majesty and sorrow\
  \ in this country overwhelms my heart."
