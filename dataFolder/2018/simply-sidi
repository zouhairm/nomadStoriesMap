Text: "Thirty six years old, happy to be single and not maternal spirit. This was\
  \ me before going to Senegal. I'm in Mbour, in front of an orphanage. Inside a room\
  \ I can see about forty children about three years old with snot on their noses.\
  \ Thirty-six years old, for me vomit, poo-poo and the children were a nightmare.\
  \ My friend invites me to come in and all the filthy children stick to my legs crying.\
  \ I wanted to escape! Snot, pee and poo-poo everywhere! I look up and at the back\
  \ of the room I see a baby with a pelouche in his hand. I approach and say \"hello\"\
  . He looks up and sticks to my legs tightly. His eyes, brown, so deep .. I took\
  \ him in my arms and he hugged me tightly. It was a strange but beautiful emotion.\
  \ His name was Sid\xEC. Senegalese woman give me bowl and spoons to take rice to\
  \ the kids. Sid\xEC stays away and looks at me sadly. I call him. He smiles and\
  \ runs to me. I was shivering. The next day I bring Sid\xEC out to play. With his\
  \ finger he indicates the sky. There is the moon. I look at him, he smiles at me,\
  \ with his finger drawn to the sky, he hugs me. The chills go through my body. I\
  \ spent all night understanding those new emotions. The next day I immediately go\
  \ to Sid\xEC, I look for him, he is not there. The crib is empty. \"He's back from\
  \ his family\". I'm happy but I'm sad. The void grows day by day. I convince my\
  \ friend to go and look for him. We only know that he is in a village called \"\
  sinthiubadan\". We go to the market, we ask how to reach the village. We show a\
  \ Sid\xEC's photo. \"It's a poulard\". We don't understand. The man we talk asks\
  \ other people and here's a young man on a horse carriage. The man tells us to go\
  \ with the boy. Incredulous we trust and get on the carriage without knowing the\
  \ destination. The boy looks at Sid\xEC's picture. He nods. Let's start. My heart\
  \ beats fast. Landscapes, villages, a dirt road, the only road. After two hours,\
  \ here is a village. A woman with a tattooed face and only a skirt on, looks at\
  \ the photograph. Talk to the driver. We proceed. It's the next village. The heart\
  \ is about to explode in my chest. Huts and tents. We arrived. Fifteen children\
  \ run to us and accompany us to the largest hut. An old woman looks at the picture.\
  \ Sid\xEC is her nephew, but he's with his father in the south of the country along\
  \ with herds of cattle. They will be back in 10 months. My effort was in vain. It's\
  \ been two years, I do not have the economic possibility to come back to look for\
  \ it but the thought of this child, since then, is daily."
