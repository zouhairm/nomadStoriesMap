Text: "Before ever meeting Freddy I first noticed his accomplices. Only a few minutes\
  \ after arriving at the hectic, bustling bus station of Leon, Nicaragua, on the\
  \ subsequent walk into town along uneven cobblestone streets lined with vibrant\
  \ buildings and people, I saw the first one standing in a door way. What stood out\
  \ immediately other than his obvious youth and poverty was the sallowed cast covering\
  \ his arm. When I got closer I noticed a water bottle wedged between his tattered\
  \ shirt and chest, seemingly singed around the rim. He asked for money in a cracked\
  \ voice, and being in a rush to find my hostel and unload my heavy backpack, I quickly\
  \ obliged. As I continued down the street I noticed another couple of teenage boys,\
  \ dirty and distracted, again one holding a charred bottle.\n\nI soon learned from\
  \ Nieke, a bright, talented young dutch backpacker, that the bottles contained glue,\
  \ an incredibly cheap and easily accessible drug the boys to use to escape the hardness\
  \ of homelessness. \"Give them food not money\" she advised.\n\nFreddy literally\
  \ jumped out at me. As a friend and I strolled around the city, we came upon a shut\
  \ cardboard box sitting in a doorway. As we passed, it suddenly flew open and there\
  \ was Freddy, yelling and then laughing frantically at his joke. After jumping in\
  \ fright I began to laugh too, and introduced myself, giving him some fruit from\
  \ Leons splendid market. From that point on I would strive to see Freddy in my travels\
  \ around the city, and eventually took him for lunch, somewhat to the chagrin of\
  \ my friends. Servers at the restaurant knew him already and laughed in spectacle\
  \ as Freddy ordered an absolutely massive plate of food, gesticulating hilariously\
  \ to everyone's entertainment. Our lunches continued afterwards, and one night,\
  \ enroute to the bar with friends, Freddy beckoned me from Leon's graffiti covered\
  \ inner city sports court, to play soccer with him and his bare footed young transient\
  \ friends. We spoke for awhile afterwards, sharing a snack. He told me he was fifteen\
  \ and from a poor coastal town, with drug addicted parents. The story for most of\
  \ the boys is similar. \n\nOn my final night in Leon, a city which captured my soul,\
  \ I bought Freddy deodorant, toothpaste, some cookies, and at his constant insistence\
  \ a beer. I gave him my email and Facebook hopelessly, which he deposited at a barber\
  \ shop that sometimes gives him shelter. We took a picture and hugged, and then\
  \ he strolled off into the night and it's wild offerings."
