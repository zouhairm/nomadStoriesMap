Text: "Searching not escaping is why I am in Bali. I arrive at the Ashram inappropriately\
  \ dressed and mentally unprepared. Am I really ready for this?\n\nIt\u2019s the\
  \ meeting of two spheres the marriage of the natural world and the spiritual world\
  \ that keeps me grounded. I\u2019ve been here so long it is assumed that this is\
  \ part of my heritage, that I have always been on this path. However the particularly\
  \ perceptive students notice otherwise,  always asking the same questions; how long\
  \ have you been here? Why did you come and why do you stay? Forever. To escape.\
  \ How could I leave... Truthfully I left everything and everyone to be here, and\
  \ found a higher purpose that justifies my existence.\n\nDeep breath. I\u2019m here\
  \ I didn\u2019t come all this way for nothing. Scanning the surroundings I can't\
  \ help but notice the simple beauty that surrounds the Ashram. The grand steps crowned\
  \ by green flora snaking down towards a central pavilion. The buildings, sporadically\
  \ located within the compound, feel somewhat romantic in their resistance to modernisation.\
  \ Cracked stone walls and chipped roofs add to their charm. Removing my shoes I\
  \ follow the path. Momentarily hypnotised by its serenity, I can feel why people\
  \ stay and never return.\n\nIt\u2019s the peace, the spirituality this is why I\
  \ stay this is what keeps me from returning. The guilt sometimes shakes my resolve\
  \ but then I remember why I left.\n\nSweat pools around my neck, is this from the\
  \ heat or simply nerves? I walk closely towards the pavilion and settle at the back,\
  \ trying to be inconspicuous, trying not to disturb the meditative silence. The\
  \ floor a mosaic of colourful patterns and meanings I do not recognise.  \u201C\
  Can I help you\u201D\n\n\u201CSorry I didn\u2019t mean to disturb, I am looking\
  \ for Ketut Arsana, sorry Guru Ketut Arsana, he is expecting me\u201D\n\n\u201C\
  Follow me\u201D \n\nDutifully I follow, I am led across the courtyard past an impressive\
  \ water feature large enough for swimming. Lily pads and exotic fishes decorating\
  \ the scene. Moss growing through steps that lead towards a submerged altar. \n\n\
  \u201CIt\u2019s for ritual cleansing, all new students go through a ceremony that\
  \ signals your rebirth into the spiritual and natural world\u201D\n\nShe caught\
  \ me staring, I feel wildly out of place here. Finally we reach a small stone outhouse\
  \ at the back of the compound. \n\n\u201CThe Guru is available to see you now\u201D\
  \n\nShe leaves me alone, my hands wont stop shaking. A voice calls out from the\
  \ back.\n\n\u201CWelcome son please enter, I knew this time would come\u201D"
