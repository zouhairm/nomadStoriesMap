Text: "Tonight is the night. \nWe are finally ready to open the restaurant. I wander\
  \ around the kitchen, sounding out every detail with an eagle gaze.\nI throw in\
  \ the rustic, stoned oven a few more logs \u2013 we were right to choose birch,\
  \ it is slightly more expensive, but the fragrant scent it gives to the pizza crust\
  \ it\u2019s worthy.\n\u201CLeave the fire and come to see my babies!\u201D Ken incites\
  \ me.\nStaggering because of the steam on my glasses, I find him bent over a big\
  \ container, like a radiant kid who shows you a secret treasure, his white teeth\
  \ standing out against the brown skin.\n\u201CThey grew up so well\u201D  he whispers\
  \ caressing the blocks of pizza dough, his huge hand now sweet and careful.\nI smile\
  \ back at him. \u201CThey are perfect Ken.\u201D\nI dry my forehead with the flour\
  \ soiled edge of my shirt \u2013 it is so hot. I step out on the red dirt, relieved\
  \ by the pleasant evening breeze.\nThe giant bamboo patio sticks out in the luxuriant\
  \ garden, with his simple tables decorated with vivacious tablecloths and palm leaves\
  \ lamps standing above them.  Most of the guests took a place, they sit sipping\
  \ ice cold drinks and chatting.\nAll of a sudden, darkness.\nI\u2019m immersed in\
  \ an impenetrable gloom, so absolute and suffocating to make me believe that all\
  \ the light of this planet is being sucked down by another galaxy. My senses only\
  \ recognize the intense smell of the hibiscus and the people murmuring. \nThe famous\
  \ blackouts that periodically plunged north Uganda into an endless night have arrived\
  \ here in Gulu. \nAnxiety gets the better of me; I turn around, convinced that I\
  \ will see in Ken my same emotion. But in the dense darkness he is calm, I perceive\
  \ his massive body relaxed even if I can\u2019t see him. It was the last thing I\
  \ expected.\nKen notices my agitation and gently looks for my shoulder.\n\u201C\
  Don\u2019t worry . There\u2019s nothing wrong.\u201D\n\u201CHow can I not worry?\
  \ We can\u2019t see a thing!\u201D \n\u201CNot seeing isn\u2019t bad\u201D he quietly\
  \ replies, \u201CWhen we were kids mom used to let us outside only in the evening;\
  \ it was too dangerous during the day because Kony\u2019s LRA ranks were going around\
  \ to recruit child soldiers. Many of my friends were abducted while they were on\
  \ their way to school or playing. That\u2019s why I like darkness.\nI fall silent.\
  \ I thought that every kid in the world was terrorized by the boogeyman, in the\
  \ night, under the bed.  On the contrary in Uganda the boogeyman came with daylight,\
  \ and darkness, as a friend, protected them.\n\u201CThank you Ken. I can now appreciate\
  \ this beautiful night. And I bet pizza is going to be great.\u201D"
