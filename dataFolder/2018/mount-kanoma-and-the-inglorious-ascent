Text: "Mt. Kanamo, 19,503 ft(5960 meters), is in Spiti district, Himachal Pradesh,\
  \ sits there as a potentate. It gives the ecstatic view of the Spiti valley, just\
  \ two eyes would not be enough, from it's most elevated seat. The ethereal beauty\
  \ of the Kanamo is that it is in the state of juxtaposition because it is a non-technical\
  \ peak, trek-able and at the same time it is tough.\n\nFrom Kaza(commercial town\
  \ in Spiti valley), we cabbed to Kibber village(4,270 meters) as the trek starts\
  \ from there. As we started from the bucolic Kibber into the east, for the first\
  \ few hours we were lilt our way through.\n\nWe pitched our 3-men tent after 3 hours\
  \ of trek beside a small pond since it was almost dusk. \n\nAnyway, we resumed the\
  \ trek in the morning with renewed energy, through the trails filled with tiny green\
  \ and red hinted bushes. One hour later, we found the base camp.\n\nThe path we\
  \ have taken at base camp was the one we regret even now. At the base camp of Kanamo\
  \ peak, there were two ways, one leads to south and another to north. We have taken\
  \ north. Few hours passed, we were passing gully after gully through a scree like\
  \ a tide hoping we can see a trail. Nope, just as we feared, we took a wrong turn\
  \ at base camp. We had an epiphany at noon that we were too far north-west to the\
  \ peak.\n\n\uFFFCOn that trail-less gully with sun on our heads, we realised that\
  \ even if we carried on, by the time we make the summit it will be almost sunset.\
  \ We will have to make the descent after dusk, we might as well run naked. So, we\
  \ thought we should head back to the base camp, stay one more night, ration our\
  \ food and take southern, well travelled, route next morning.\n\n By the time we\
  \ reached the base camp, it was minutes away of sunset. With the heavy winds pushing\
  \ away, we struggled to pitch the tent, but not before one of the tent loop hit\
  \ me in the eye. There was a sharp pain in the eye, due to high altitude, it became\
  \ worse. I just rubbed it off and hoped it would be fine next morning.\n\nThe whole\
  \ night was dreadful for me, with every passing second the ache in the eye was poking\
  \ .We had not felt like waking up even after the dawn of next morning, it became\
  \ clear we cannot make the ascent anymore as our bodies started to give in. So we\
  \ head back.\n\nWith an eye patch, faded bownish jacket and an aura of pickle, I\
  \ looked like a pirate when I returned.\n\n After all, if I heard it correctly,\
  \ Kanamo means \"white lady\" and to conquer a lady , you should be persistent and\
  \ have some patience with love."
