Text: "The old black cab lurched to a stop. The driver turned to my companions and\
  \ me and said in a low growl of an Irish accent, \"We're here, step out please.\"\
  \ As we stood from the cab trying to catch our bearings, we were immediately met\
  \ with two soldiers holdings AK-47's. Black ski masks covered their faces and the\
  \ barrels of their weapons followed us as we left the vehicle. It was in this moment\
  \ I realized, now I feel it... this is Belfast.  \n\nBelfast was the last stop on\
  \ a holiday trip. My companions and I had taken in the nightlife of Dublin, the\
  \ culture of Galway, and the magic of looking over the Cliffs of Moher. We all knew\
  \ of the tumultuous history of sectarian violence that had occurred two decades\
  \ earlier between the Ulster/Protestant Loyalists and the Irish Catholic in Belfast\
  \ (along with the infamous Irish Republican Army) and decided to see it for ourselves.\
  \  \n\nThe two soldiers who had appeared before us holding AK-47's were part of\
  \ an Ulster mural in a Loyalist neighborhood, which paid homage to their fallen\
  \ kin and the S.A.S (Special Air Service) soldiers who helped keep Belfast in the\
  \ grasp of the United Kingdom. The last thing I expected to see while in Belfast\
  \ was the close proximity of Ulster and Irish Catholic neighborhoods. Special iron\
  \ gates and twenty-foot-high stone walls complete with barbed wire kept these groups\
  \ of people at an arm's length, far enough to keep the peace, but close enough to\
  \ keep tabs on one another. \"Prepared for Peace, ready for war,\" was down every\
  \ street. \n\nOn the Irish side of the walls, names and faces of IRA members killed\
  \ during the conflict were laden with fresh flowers and messages of tribute. While\
  \ on the Loyalist side, these same faces were etched with the word \"terrorist\"\
  \ underneath the graffiti \"X\" that now was a part of their faces. I had never\
  \ been to a place which embodied the ethnic strife, hatred, and conflict that brought\
  \ to life all that I had ever read about in articles and textbooks. The conflict\
  \ became tangible, as I walked the same streets that had seen violence encapsulated\
  \ by occupying soldiers marching and car bombs an everyday part of life.  \n\nBelfast\
  \ had a striking resemblance to Berlin during the 80's, where political and ideological\
  \ divisions were broken down over time by a unified longing for community. I have\
  \ never expected to fall in love with Belfast the way that I did, a place where\
  \ a one man's freedom fighter is another man's terrorist."
