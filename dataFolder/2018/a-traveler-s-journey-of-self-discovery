Text: "My soul has always been a seeker of adventure.  I had been to as many places\
  \ as my income would allow as a girl in her early twenties:  Puerto Rico, Miami,\
  \ Hawaii, Las Vegas, Arizona, Dominican Republic, and Mexico.  The travel bug hit\
  \ me early, but I knew this was little compared to the rest of the world I longed\
  \ to explore!  During all the working, saving, and traveling I fell in love.  I\
  \ fell hard.  An opportunity arose for me to move to Phoenix and because I\u2019\
  ve never lived anywhere other than Brooklyn, the adventurer in me decided to take\
  \ a chance and see where this new journey would take me.  I made new friends, got\
  \ a great job, and explored my new surroundings as much as I could!  For a brief\
  \ period of time I was happy, but things took a turn for the worse.  The man I fell\
  \ in love with was not who he portrayed himself to be during our budding romance\
  \ in New York.  The first slap in the face was a complete shock to me.  In a matter\
  \ of seconds my whole world shifted.  I could feel my soul float above my body.\
  \  I lost myself.  For the next couple of years I took a backseat to my life and\
  \ had no idea who was at the wheel.  Eventually, I took back control.  In taking\
  \ back my power I decided to stick it out in this still unfamiliar land.  Despite\
  \ the odds, I had made a decision to continue on this journey to brave the wilderness\
  \ of life all on my own. When my son turned one I flew to New York to celebrate\
  \ with loved ones.  I had all intentions on continuing what started as an adventure,\
  \ but being around my family changed that.  That was the decision that pushed me\
  \ to the edge.  Feeling all the love and support my family provided became the fuel\
  \ to begin a new journey; a fearless adventure to find myself again.  An expedition\
  \ to create a safe, fulfilling, daring, goal achieving, and exciting life!  These\
  \ past several years have been a thrilling ride!  Succeeding professionally, in\
  \ love, at setting my travel goals, and nailing them every time.  It\u2019s been\
  \ a whirlwind of exhilarating experiences!  From kissing the Blarney Stone in Ireland,\
  \ to pub crawls riding the Tube in London, to hot springs in Iceland!  I don\u2019\
  t think I would have ever achieved all that I have if it wasn\u2019t for that one\
  \ decision I made years ago.  A decision to choose me.  A decision to not let fear\
  \ influence my judgment.  A decision to allow happiness and adventure back in my\
  \ life.  A decision to create a life I deserve.  A life full of attainable dreams\
  \ that soon will become a reality."
