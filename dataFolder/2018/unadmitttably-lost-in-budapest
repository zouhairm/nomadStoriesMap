Text: "Well, I thought I had the accommodations that night all figured out. We were\
  \ traveling that day by train from Prague to Budapest. I was the most fluent in\
  \ English among the 4 of us who met in Greece and decided to explore other parts\
  \ of Europe together. On board the train, using our Eural passes we would figure\
  \ out our itinerary and accommodations so that when we arrived -in this case into\
  \ Budapest -we could go right to the hostel or inexpensive hotel to stay. So, as\
  \ we neared Hungary I took the tour book and looked for a place. Usually accurate\
  \ when doing this having experience finding things and being able to understand\
  \ well- I told the others I found this particular place having looked at and studied\
  \ the city road map.And, the other three travelers having faith in me relaxed and\
  \ were ok with the place we were going to. The price and location was good to them.\
  \ So as we were still out in the country side going towards Budapest I was reading\
  \ from a book I bought back in one of the train stations in Cologne and the guys\
  \ I met in Greece were talking and sharing among themselves.\n\nSo, when the train\
  \ arrived in Budapest we were all interested and excited to be there to see all\
  \ the sights and as well to find the hostel. I, the leader told the others the directions\
  \ to follow as I thought this train station and the hostel we nearby. We walked\
  \ off the plank and followed the map. Going out in a dark new place it -downtown\
  \ Budapest we were a little edgy to find the hostel, The directions weren't working\
  \ out though. We went just south of the station but there wasn't any hostel as we\
  \ thought. We all started to become upset and frustrated as it had been a long day.\
  \ So we started to ask around to people speaking English if they knew where this\
  \ particular place was. Turns out it was across town and quite a bit away from where\
  \ we were as there are 2 station stops in Budapest. \n\nI admiitably embarassed\
  \ and upset at myself having done quite a bit of traveling and was a group leader\
  \ - offered my sincerest apologies to the them. It's not that we all were lost but,\
  \ that  I thought I knew where that particular hostel was. So we got instructions\
  \ to the other station and then walked out a block or so and found it. Turned out\
  \ it was a really nice and somewhat fancy place to stay with amenities and that\
  \ the location served as a good place to travel from as it was central to the city.\
  \ Again, I apologized  to my travel mates but, will always remember this when  I\
  \ think of Budapest."
