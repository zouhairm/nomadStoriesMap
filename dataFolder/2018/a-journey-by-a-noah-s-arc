Text: "\u201CBeaten down I sit on these stairs and watch bodies turning to flames\u201D\
  .\nArun mused looking at the men poking the half-burnt body with a log. A lurid,\
  \ pungent smell filled the air and flying ashes turned the crimson sky pallid. Arun,\
  \ our rower, a goldsmith by profession, took the boat from a kingpin of renting-boats\
  \ business to earn some fast bucks.\nMy eyes were transfixed at the stairs of the\
  \ burning ghat. Souls ascend to heaven on dying here. While Arun\u2019s oars slapped\
  \ the placid water, images wrought in it kept quivering.\n\u201CI dont find any\
  \ meaning in the relationship. Keep me out of your life\u201D\nIt was just the other\
  \ day. I was thrown off from the pantheon of her love. My soul singed like the smouldering\
  \ embers of the burning pyre.\n\u201CLook at the stark futility of life\u201D, Arun\u2019\
  s soul-searching met a wry smile of mine.\nThe boat floated parallel to the ashen-faced\
  \ frenzied men on the road. Some urchins were dancing to the percussive beats of\
  \ their cymbals and drums. Paraphernalia of evening aarti was going on in great\
  \ fervour. Thousands were pouring in to observe the divine flame flying heavenwards.\
  \ Some raucous boys kept jumping over the temple stairs to catch kites floating\
  \ down from the sky and a solitary boy was flying a kite above the gulls swooping\
  \ down to nibble the grains thrown at them by Nil, my partner.\n\u201CGulls are\
  \ godsend. In the winters they come as the messengers and return home with the names\
  \ of those who do good on earth\u201D\n\u201CTo be chosen in heaven?\u201D amused\
  \ at Arun\u2019s self-styled philosophy Nil quipped mockingly.\n\u201CYes or die\
  \ here. Dying in Varanasi emancipates one\u2019s soul from taking a rebirth.\u201D\
  \ \nBy now we came to the other end of our journey, the much famed Manikarnika Ghat,\
  \ a bigger burning ghat than the other. Sadhus were smoking chillums and the last\
  \ rites were more of a festivity in giggling, chatting and card-game.\n\u201CHere\
  \ death too is a frenzy. See the fun they are having and think of the wife back\
  \ home\u201D.\nWe were floating alongside the chiaroscuro of chaos and colours,\
  \ macaberesque and melancholic, intense yet indifferent.\n\u201CEverything is empty\u201D\
  , Arun\u2019s voice trails off.\nWhile Nil was missing his little daughter back\
  \ home, I thought of the futility of emotions. Bargaining with the rower seemed\
  \ bit lopsided, for the wisdom he served apart from the evening boat ride. I wondered\
  \ at the endless vicissitudes of life. When we grope ways through its labyrinth,\
  \ there will always be an Arun to serve you the unfound answers and to moor the\
  \ boat in a safe harbor."
