Text: "During my elementary school years, I'd always gone to El Salvador every summer\
  \ to visit family. I'd shuffle back and forth between Santa Tecla and Soyapango,\
  \ mostly sticking to spots like Metrocentro and the beaches. There was the occasional\
  \ trip to the Santa Ana - Chalchuapa area to go to the Galicia water park, but overall\
  \ I remained at my cousins' sides as they went about their routines. It was not\
  \ until 2005 that my family and I decided to visit a few historical sites. \n\n\
  The first one we chose was Joya de Ceren. I admit that I expected it to be much\
  \ like a typical museum, with the most notable exhibits behind glass and a few reconstructions\
  \ - almost nothing about the everyday life of the people. I was pleasantly surprised\
  \ to see that this wasn't the case at Ceren. I was amazed by the relative completeness\
  \ of the village. I could see the intact walls and doorways - basically the layout\
  \ of the village homes. The pots and maize grinders behind the glass were pretty\
  \ cool as well, they would not look out of place in the present day. Overall, I\
  \ loved seeing the dwellings and artifacts so much that I ended up buying a black\
  \ stone figurine that I keep in my drawers to this day.\n\nAnother historical site\
  \ we came upon later on was San Andres. While it wasn't excavated as much at the\
  \ time I visited, it was surprising to be able to walk among the \nmini-pyramids.\
  \ It was different from Ceren in this regard, as well as vendors being allowed relatively\
  \ close. There wasn't much to do apart from walk around and see similar artifacts\
  \ at the museum. Just walking so close among the ruins was enough for me. Lastly,\
  \ we saw el Tazumal. Appearance-wise, it was the most impressive. Large and more\
  \ preserved when compared to San Andres, I was pretty disappointed to see it was\
  \ mostly sealed off at the time. We couldn't do much but take pictures, which I've\
  \ since misplaced around the house. I hope to visit again soon as I'm sure it's\
  \ no longer sealed off.\n\nFinally, my interest in ancient and medieval history\
  \ started around 1st grade and it was there that I started assuming that larger\
  \ and more elaborate sites would be more interesting and more worth seeing. I was\
  \ not expecting the smaller ones to blow me away the most. As a result, I look forward\
  \ to seeing less famous historical monuments in the future as much as more famous\
  \ ones."
