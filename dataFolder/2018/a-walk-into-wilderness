Text: "Thee experiences and views around the hilly streets of downtown and the city\
  \ life one can easily loose the measure of time while being in San Fransisco. Yet\
  \ there are times when amidst the extravagant lifestyle, beautiful architecture\
  \ and sumptuous cuisines one seeks Nature\u2019s Enchantment, a walk into wilderness\
  \ where destinations are blurred and the only experience that remains is the journey.\
  \ Crossing the majestic Golden Gate bridge leads you to the Sausalito City which\
  \ takes you to the Muir Woods National Monument. \nAt about 40-45 minutes drive\
  \ across the Golden Gate Bridge, the Muir Woods National Monument is a renowned\
  \ forest in California, across the United States and beyond and is a part of the\
  \ US National Park Service. The woods are rich in old growth coast redwoods Sequoia\
  \ Sempervirens. The preservation of the woods was primarily due to the efforts of\
  \ William Kent who gifted the property to the federal government. \nMuir Woods National\
  \ Monument is located on the Marin Peninsula bordering the Pacific Ocean to the\
  \ west and San Francisco and San Pablo bays to the east with trees at an average\
  \ age of 500-600 years old with elder trees aged as old as 1500 years. The magnificence\
  \ of the woods characterized by their height, structure, visual beauty and age has\
  \ been a constant source of inspiration for writers and literature enthusiasts.\
  \ The drive to Muir woods as we leave the city and enter Mill valley starts becoming\
  \ difficult. Largely a comfortable ride, the drive does present a few hairpin bends\
  \ and inconvenient turns however since the drive was a short one it didn\u2019t\
  \ cause much trouble. The entrance fee for a visit to the woods is $10 for people\
  \ 16 years and elder. One can explore the woods across 4 bridges and trails like\
  \ the the Redwood Creek Trail, Bohemian Grove Trail, Cathedral Grove and the Fern\
  \ Creek to name a few. During my walk in the woods I witnessed beautiful trees with\
  \ different shapes, structures and heights. The more disfigured or unusual a tree\
  \ seemed to be, the more beautiful it appeared. Drawing this analogy to life I realized\
  \ that we all are like these imperfect unusual trees, the more imperfections and\
  \ differences that life presents us , the more beautiful we actually are. While\
  \ preparing for a travel to the woods I was carrying a heavy baggage of my own problems\
  \ and difficult experiences in the past. The last i expected was to be enthralled\
  \ by the sheer silence and peace that being in the woods could offer."
