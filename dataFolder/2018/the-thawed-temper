Text: "Mountains and Snow always had a different way to talk out things with me. \
  \ I believe it is in its enormousness and in depths of the capability of attracting\
  \ the wanderers around its mightiness.\nI am one such wanderer who gets so melted\
  \ and lost in the beauty of the mountains. It is their hugs where I feel I am most\
  \ sorted. Well, it was one such time in past where me coming up as a solo traveler\
  \ and realizing this is what I wanted from my life began. I was browsing various\
  \ adventure sites challenging the internet speed, which could offer me a good package\
  \ to gather as much peace and discovering myself.\nI had reasons to be depressed.\
  \ Death. My mother passed away and to clear the void I just needed a break. In my\
  \ thoughts, I could sense mountains breathing with me.  Well, my trip began and\
  \ I had to summit Sarpass, Kasol, Himachal Pradesh India.  While preparing myself\
  \ to board a bus to Bhuntar there stayed a sweet nervousness in me. It defined and\
  \ made a cloud full of imaginative thoughts around my cortex as to how beautiful\
  \ and pristine can the mountains who were reminding me to meet them will appear?\
  \ Will I able to control myself? Will they talk to me? These were all answered when\
  \ the next while getting down from the bus the subtle red sun rays warmed my cheeks.\
  \ Homecoming. It seemed as if the cold comforting breeze challenged my feminism.\
  \ The mists that flew in the streams of water surrounded in the grip of Himalayas,\
  \ the clinches of crystals reflected the calmness of the non-tussling rocks is where\
  \ lied Kasol. The mountains which talked both nostalgia and surrealism fenced in\
  \ me the curiosity to know \u2018The Giants\u2019!\nThere were this unusual belongingness\
  \ and confidence of meeting someone on my journey and I did meet Tiger. Pahadi Dog\
  \ (Mountain bred dog). Tiger a cute Pahadi dog taught me patience and inculcated\
  \ in me footprints of selflessness with glimpses of sincerity. There was certainly\
  \ something different with the dog. I guess it was the Pahadi thing. The dog played\
  \ with me all day long by the garden outside my hotel room where I smoked my first\
  \ weed. Tiger did enjoy the smell and why not, of course, it was a Pahadi dog. Tiger\
  \ licked around my fist and cuddled itself around my thighs making a semi-circle\
  \ to get an unexpected nap. My journey of towards the Sarpass summit took a whistle\
  \ blow and Tiger with his little paws wished me luck. It marked an elite example\
  \ of making a local connection which will always stay ignited in the heart. It thaws\
  \ me whenever I attend to the memories."
