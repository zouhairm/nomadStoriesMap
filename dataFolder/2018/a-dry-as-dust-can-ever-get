Text: "Under the blinding heat of the deserts dazzling sun-rays, I peered from my\
  \ awning to witness the spectacle of the Bedouin- her beautifully soulful eyes shone\
  \ from under her black burqa as bright as the sun that refused to cease shining,\
  \ as she swish-swashed her feeble feet slowly along the silky-soft dunes of the\
  \ sand in hope of satiating her thirst. She glanced back at her tent, pitched in\
  \ the sand under the shade of the scarce date palms, besieged by lazing camels,\
  \ to have one last look at her children until she returned. I looked at her black\
  \ attire and thought- Who said angels dress only in white?\n\nMy arm accidentally\
  \ grazed across the only plant that graced this wilderness. The thongs of the cactus\
  \ scarred my skin and I tried to stop the bleeding. I looked longingly at the jeep\
  \ of supplies I had carried with me but shook my head. To connect with the desert\
  \ quintessentially and spiritually, one must experience the brunt of the desert\
  \ in all its dusty diabolical glory. \n\nIt was getting hotter and the gushing hot\
  \ winds weren\u2019t making it any easier. I stared on to an expanse of endless\
  \ golden sand that seemed to engulf anything that dared to set foot on this dicey\
  \ trail. The clear blue skies that one could barely see in the bedazzling light\
  \ let no cloud near it to consume even a ray of light. All of it struck the earth\
  \ unadulterated. \n\nIt was evening by the time she returned. The sun had begun\
  \ to sink amidst the straight horizon. All the energy that had evaporated like effervescent\
  \ vapor during the heat of the day seemed to trickle back. Her eyes twinkled akin\
  \ to the little stars that had just begun to show up in the sky as she strode with\
  \ a pot of water.\n\nI watched as they sat down to eat a humble meal of dates, water\
  \ and Kawa coffee. I felt compelled to approach them and I did. The children looked\
  \ at me fearfully. Father had warned them about desert bandits lurking at night.\
  \ \n\nBut she had one glance at me and smiled, welcoming me. There was Arabic music\
  \ playing that made me feel oddly at peace in this unfamiliar terrain.  I knew neither\
  \ their language nor anything about them. But the hospitality of the Bedouins that\
  \ warm night under the stars made me realize the magnificence of life in lack of\
  \ pretense. The desert delineates to you the harshness of life, yet its apparent\
  \ simplicity. It taunts you with a mirage as you trudge mile after mile in hope\
  \ of water. But as you lay down to watch the sun go down with those who matter,\
  \ life has a simpler meaning."
