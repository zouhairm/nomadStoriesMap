Text: "2 hours into a 14 hour plane ride, while my co-passengers were finally drifting\
  \ off from their sleep aids or unknowingly being a nuisance to other passengers\
  \ with their reading lights, I could do nothing but marinate in the pure excitement\
  \ of the adventure I was about to embark on.\n\n3 weeks in a completely new continent,\
  \ learning a new language, eating new foods, meeting new people. I couldn\u2019\
  t stop imagining what Japan would be like. I saw myself swallowed by a sea of bustling\
  \ people, bewitched by the buzzing of an unfamiliar yet tranquil language. I envisioned\
  \ myself enchanted by a dazzling neon city with the likes of Times Square, a little\
  \ more state-of-the-art, a little less Broadway. I expected Japan to be everything\
  \ I had ever seen it was on television, in the books, in the movies.\n\nShikoku\
  \ was the last thing I expected. On this beautiful island off of the mainland of\
  \ Japan, the influence of the Tokyopian empire I had dreamt up was instantly transformed\
  \ into a reality of beauty I had not prepared to indulge in. The image of the sea\
  \ of people I was anticipating revealed itself to be a forest of tropical plants\
  \ sprinkled with beautifully intentional interruptions - tactically designed housing,\
  \ methodically placed markets and shrines risen up by Buddha himself. A lingering\
  \ feeling of deeply rooted culture and a ritualized way of living filled the air.\
  \ \n\nMy anticipation of a towering city with a neon shadow was metamorphosed into\
  \ a gratitude for a simple yet otherworldly village. The home-stay experience plunged\
  \ me further into the depth of the wonder, skipping out on the americanized depiction\
  \ of the country and learning what a real life in Japan was like. On the plane I\
  \ dreamt of navigating streets with arms burdened with bags of foreign clothes and\
  \ gadgets I could brag about when returning stateside. The sacred pebble paths my\
  \ feet actually traveled, and the meaningful ornaments I returned with trumped the\
  \ most vivid of my dreams.\n\nWhile Japan was something completely different than\
  \ I expected, I was also something different for the people of Shikoku. The experience\
  \ of being an exotic being in an exotic place was nothing short of magical. Many\
  \ on the island of Shikoku had never laid eyes on melanated skin, or the geometrics\
  \ of box braids. A host grandmother of mine told me (through translation) she could\
  \ die happy knowing that she encountered an angel of my kind. I never expected to\
  \ be as much as a gift to Shikoku as Shikoku was to me."
