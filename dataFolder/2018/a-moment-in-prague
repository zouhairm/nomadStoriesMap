Text: "\"Your vacation is over.\"\n\nThose words stung almost as much the kidney stone\
  \ that was lodged inside of me. The doctor must have seen my pain, but he continued\
  \ on. anyway.\n\n\"Listen to me. It's over 8mm. There's no way you can pass that\
  \ on your own. You're already bleeding. You need emergency surgery, the sooner the\
  \ better. Look, we can put a temporary stent in right now. You can stay here in\
  \ the hospital overnight, then go back to America tomorrow. Or you can drive to\
  \ the airport immediately and try to get the next flight out of here. Either way,\
  \ you'll need to go to the ER when you get home. These are your choices. Understand?\
  \ You're done.\"\n\nI sat back in the clinic and closed my eyes. I'd like to think\
  \ that I was shaking because of the raw agony stabbing me from the inside out, but\
  \ I know it was more than that. I couldn't get out of this on my own. The rest of\
  \ my tour group was going to leave me behind, and I had zero chance of catching\
  \ up. After hobbling around Prague all morning, I could barely walk anymore. I don't\
  \ even know how I'd made it across Charles Bridge in the summer crowds and heat.\
  \ I'd already been sent away from two other hospitals, neither of which had a urologist\
  \ - English-speaking or otherwise - available on a Sunday. This was only three days\
  \ into a two week trip; I'd just gotten over the jet lag. I'd done a lot on my travels.\
  \ I'd hiked mountains and rainforests, wandered ancient ruins, and sailed past even\
  \ older cliffs. I didn't expect an adventure this time, just a road trip around\
  \ Europe. This was supposed to be an easy one. How could something so small stop\
  \ me?\n\n\"What's your decision?\" The doctor stared at me impatiently.\n\nDesperation\
  \ affects people in different ways. Some panic. Others shut down completely. But\
  \ right then, I was beyond livid. Not just because a trip of a lifetime was slipping\
  \ away from me. Nor was it because I was stranded in a lonely hospital halfway around\
  \ the world, with my survival in the hands of strangers. It was because I'd finally\
  \ reached a point in my life where I had no control. A terrifying prospect. For\
  \ all my cleverness, willpower, and anger, I had nothing. No idea of how - or if\
  \ - I'd make it home. Fine, then. If I had no plan, then I could just live one minute\
  \ at a time. It's those dark moments that you're truly alive, and find out who you\
  \ really are. When you're out of options, all you can do is give up and laugh. \n\
  \nMine was bitter and ragged.  \n\nI opened my eyes and wiped away the tears.\n\n\
  \"Help me.\""
