Text: I went to newzealand in 2011 and i stayed one and half year. It is a amazing
  country and people are so benevolent. Moreover there is zero crime far safe than
  other countries.. laws are simple and reasonable prices of things.as i belong to
  sikh religion i met every religion people over there.i went to mosque, temple and
  gurudwara. I made lots of friends and i went to south island with them.we saw almost
  all cities of south island in newzealand. It is paradise of earth . So quiet one
  can even listen his own heart beat its so calm and relax atmosphere. To add on there
  natural beauty is beath taking u just lost in the lap of nature and u forget the
  worries of life after seeing the scenery and it would help u to be a good man. Stop
  feeling jeoulsy from  others u will be happy in yur life.. the life of newzealand
  is simple and u feel u have just come after meditation from hills.i personally belief
  what ever my thinking is it is because of my visit to newzealand. It seems to me
  my second home. I respect everyone there all the nation and especially cops are
  so good and help every time if needed.
