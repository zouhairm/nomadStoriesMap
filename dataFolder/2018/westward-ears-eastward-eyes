Text: "It came into view just as daylight made its escape to the west.\n\nA handmade\
  \ structure sealed with dried mud at every gap and joint. A single chimney pipe\
  \ braced its sloped tin roof, secured by the desert stone that composed its rounded\
  \ walls. The ceremonial Hogan kept watch over a modest homestead enveloped by the\
  \ seemingly endless sandscape of Navajo Nation. It was hard to ignore the contrasting\
  \ beauty that appeared just beyond its confines, where two colossal spires pierced\
  \ through a flourishing canyon; a proverbial Eden amidst an otherwise barren landscape.\n\
  \ \n\u201CI see you\u2019ve found Bear\u2019s Ears.\u201D\n \nA wise, weathered\
  \ voice approached from the small house adjacent to the Hogan. \u201COur people\
  \ grow and gather on the land surrounding it, just as we always have.\u201D\n\n\
  She opened her hand to reveal a small bundle of autumn sage in her palm. Its rosy\
  \ hues radiated against her aged, earth tone skin. The aroma from its minty leaves\
  \ filled the air between us as she placed the bundle in my hand.\n \n\u201CIt\u2019\
  s vital to our healing ceremonies. The yarrow and primrose in our medicines, the\
  \ sagebrush and the juniper\u2026 they all grow just beyond where you can see.\u201D\
  \ She motioned back towards the lush terrain surrounding the monument\u2019s towering\
  \ formations. \u201CIs it what you expected?\u201D\n \nI wasn\u2019t sure what I\
  \ expected. This landmark that stood as a tribute to the Navajo ancestry found itself\
  \ in the crosshairs of a divisive land battle, while its children stood to bare\
  \ the ultimate burden. I was no stranger to the decision that had been made, knowing\
  \ the inevitable had become reality. Gathering would soon give way to extraction.\n\
  \nWe entered the Hogan where a dimly burning fire was surrounded by a dirt floor\
  \ and stone walls, charred by generations of time-honored ceremonies. She singed\
  \ the edges of the sage before reciting a Navajo blessing for safe travels in her\
  \ native language. Placing her calloused hand on my shoulder, she turned our attention\
  \ back towards the doorway.\n \n\u201CThe entrance of a Hogan always faces east\
  \ to welcome the morning. We\u2019ll continue to do the same, just as we always\
  \ have.\u201D\n\nLittle more was said. Little more needed to be. There was no minimizing\
  \ the profound impact this would have on the Navajo, yet somehow, her hope remained\
  \ the same. \n\nAs the sun set to the west, her focus remained to the east, where\
  \ her Earth Mother\u2019s light and provision would soon rise again. \n\nJust as\
  \ it always had."
