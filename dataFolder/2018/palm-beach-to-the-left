Text: "Unending roads, vans and a sign that reads \u201CPalm Beach,10 km\u201D. There\
  \ was barely any wind and the heat was unbearable. Actually, I\u2019m still wondering\
  \ why we thought it would be a good idea to go strolling to La Huesteca of Monterrey\
  \ at midday. I remember the sound of our steps on that arid land, so yellow as if\
  \ the sun itself had painted it. There were four wild donkeys failing at finding\
  \ something to have a bite, while two Mexican men riding horses, who were the perfect\
  \ image of every clich\xE9 of a northerner, were buying water in a tiny taco stand.\
  \ We walked for hours and Blanca thought we had arrived to the frontier of Texas.\
  \ I don\u2019t blame her, the landscape looked like every Western movie of the 80s.\
  \ \n\nWe kept walking and saw another sign from afar, \u201CPalm Beach, 1 km\u201D\
  . We could hear some chords of country music from the road heading north. Three\
  \ folk men with wooden guitars smiled at us. A few seconds later, they started playing\
  \ a song. I guess the last thing they expected that afternoon was five foreign spectators.\
  \ Some minutes passed and they finished the song looking at us as if they were waiting\
  \ for something.\n\n\u201CWe want to get to Palm Beach\u201D, said Pablo.\n\nThe\
  \ three men stayed quiet and smiled. One of them, showing the typical wiliness of\
  \ the deepest Mexico, cleared his throat and answered:\n\n\u201C\xC1ndele, go straight\u201D\
  .\n\nThe sun was beating down, but we imagined our fate would be like an oasis (actually,\
  \ a fountain would have done). Finally, after a few minutes, we saw a sign reading\
  \ \u201CPalm Beach\u201D pointing to the left. We turned our heads and only saw\
  \ a grey farm surrounded by a kilometric fence. The feeling was similar to when\
  \ you go home wanting to eat the last slice of pizza left from last night and you\
  \ open the box to find that someone already ate it. \n\nWe changed our direction,\
  \ the men with the hat saw us coming back and smiled (more mischivious this time).\
  \ On our way to the main road we found an old man with savage eyes and white moustache,\
  \ he blinked less than a person ought to. We asked him about Palm Beach\u2026 the\
  \ man answered faltering that it was a business.\n\n\u201CWhat kind of business?\u201D\
  \ asked Alex.\n\n\u201CYou know, mijo, that kind of business\u2026\u201D\n\nCarolina,\
  \ as always, thought it would be something related to narcos while Blanca thought\
  \ it would be about prostitutes and Pablo guessed they meant illegal traffic of\
  \ organs. \xC1lex, optimistically, decided it would be a celebrations hall. However,\
  \ I keep picturing Palm Beach as a beach surrounded by coconut trees."
