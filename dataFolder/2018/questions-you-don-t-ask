Text: "Hammocks fluttered like prayer flags in the wind, their colours whipped into\
  \ a frenzy as the cargo ship gained momentum. A dugout canoe emerged from the undergrowth\
  \ and sidled up to the ship and a local jumped onboard, weaving between the hammocks\
  \ selling cold drinks and cooked prawns. Room service, Amazon style. That evening,\
  \ even the laziest hammock- dwellers would be roused by the chorus of howler monkeys\
  \ from the jungle. I climbed to the top deck and watched the sun setting on the\
  \ latte- coloured water. Black beetles the size of fifty cent coins and giant iridescent\
  \ green butterflies with lacy white wings fluttered around the fluorescent lights,\
  \ and the next morning I awoke to see pink dolphins playing near the ship. The open\
  \ deck of a cargo ship was the cheapest and easiest way to get around the massive\
  \ river and its' sinuous tributaries. There were hundreds of mostly local Brazilians\
  \ sharing the open space, and as the lone solo female foreigner, I enjoyed their\
  \ company. But not in the wildest jungle in the world did I expect to meet a man\
  \ like Ivar.\n\nIvar was Swedish, and a former cocaine trafficker and mixed martial\
  \ arts fighter with a shaved head. He carried a machete with him and had ambitions\
  \ of camping and fishing alone in the jungle for a month. He had heard a rumour\
  \ that he could buy a baby jaguar, and he planned to train it to protect him. (Protect\
  \ him from what? Other jaguars? I didn't dare ask. There are some questions you\
  \ don't ask a guy who has the word 'agony' tattooed on his knuckles) Despite his\
  \ piercing blue eyes and violent temper, there was something almost childlike about\
  \ Ivar. He would openly confide painful stories about his lonely childhood on a\
  \ fishing boat with an abusive father, and the years he had spent in jail missing\
  \ a girlfriend who had left him. There was something vulnerable and honest about\
  \ him. He travelled with only a tiny backpack- though he bragged about his three\
  \ jet-skis back home, he had very little he wanted to bring with him on his year-\
  \ long South American voyage. \n\nSolo travellers tend to gravitate towards each\
  \ other. I spent three days with Ivar, drinking warm beer under the open showers\
  \ on the top deck. When we arrived in the bustling port city of Santarem, I turned\
  \ to say goodbye but he was gone, like a cowboy legend disappearing into the horizon\
  \ in search of an elusive Wild West. I never saw him again. But I hope he found\
  \ more than the baby jaguar he thought he was looking for."
