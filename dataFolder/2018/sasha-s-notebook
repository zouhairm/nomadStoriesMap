Text: "Everyone in our hostal had clicked with someone; everyone besides me. Jenny,\
  \ my beautiful Mexican best friend, and 2 girls from Chile were bonding over their\
  \ love for yoga; Dejan, the dashing Bosnian, and Adam were having an intense debate\
  \ over American politics with a German photographer, and I was left alone. Now,\
  \ before you think I am wallowing in self-pity, let me say that I thrive off being\
  \ alone, and besides, I had a mission to accomplish. I took one last look at my\
  \ friends laughing, drinking, and debating, I smiled at the joy and diversity I\
  \ saw in the room, and I slipped out the door without anyone realizing I had left.\n\
  I followed the music. I had heard it yesterday; the melody of a guitar that had\
  \ no voice to accompany it. Turning the corner I found a man sitting in a plastic\
  \ chair on the side of the road with nothing but his instrument. His hair was long,\
  \ the color unknown beneath the amount of dirt and grease, and he had a fairly long\
  \ beard that was equally disheveled. Before I could get close enough to say anything,\
  \ he had already noticed my approach, and the white smile that broke through his\
  \ leathered skin told me I was welcome to join. Our first half-hour of communication\
  \ was with music alone as we sat passing the guitar back and forth, basking in the\
  \ warm ocean air. \nSasha could not speak English or Spanish, and his Russian was\
  \ of no help, but conversations can be had without words. Grief was easy to distinguish\
  \ as he said hija (\u201Cdaughter\u201D in Spanish) followed by violent movements\
  \ ending with a motion symbolizing death. His stories of war, confusion, and travel\
  \ were expressed mostly through noises, actions, and facial expressions, and they\
  \ could have gone on all night. He wanted to seek asylum in the United States but\
  \ had no means either to travel there or the correct papers to stay. He exhibited\
  \ his determination through the notebooks he brought out from a bag he had hidden\
  \ nearby. I turned page after page, eyes wide at the number of signatures and encouraging\
  \ messages he had acquired from travelers he had met on his journey. He knew where\
  \ he wanted to go, and he believed that with enough support he would get there.\
  \  \nWhen the last of the sunlight had finally gone and we said our goodbyes, I\
  \ was left with inspiration and sadness. As I added my name to his notebook I realized\
  \ Sasha was someone I would never forget. It was the kind of connection that leaves\
  \ you wanting more from life. Sasha, I hope you made it to where you were going."
