Text: "It had been 2 whole minutes since we were here. There was no sound except the\
  \ clicks of the camera and the gentle breeze rustling the leaves of the trees. The\
  \ leopard stared at the sambar deer ahead and we stared at both of them.\n\nOur\
  \ group got to see at least 1 of the 22 leopards that had their home in Tadoba Andhari\
  \ Tiger Reserve, in each of the safaris we went. The others got to see the tigers,\
  \ but never a leopard. We were in the middle of a wildlife sanctuary in India, and\
  \ were about to witness a kill, late in the afternoon of a pleasant January day.\
  \ Something that we had watched on National Geographic a hundred times, but nothing\
  \ could compare to the adrenaline rush witnessing it first hand.\n\nThe leopard\
  \ crouched low in the middle of a narrow dirt track, with it's unwavering attention\
  \ on the sambar deer grazing right in front of it. The sambar deer was alone, and\
  \ sensed some danger, and looked around.\n\n\"Look at the leopard's tail\", our\
  \ guide whispered to us.\nThe tail which was flat on the ground, slowly started\
  \ rising, centimeter by centimeter. \n\nThe leopard had sensed the fear of its prey\
  \ and was getting itself ready to attack. But the deer was too hungry to notice\
  \ and went back to grazing.\n\nUnless you had your eyes fixed on the leopard, you'd\
  \ have missed the smallest movements. By now half of the leopard's tail was up,\
  \ and it was slowly rising. The sambar felt the tension around it, took one look\
  \ at the leopard and became frightened. \n\nThe leopard sprang at the deer. The\
  \ sambar was startled and took off in the other direction, with our spotted friend\
  \ right at its tail. With one swift, graceful leap, the leopard was at the deer's\
  \ throat. It sank its teeth into the deer's slender throat and held it firmly, letting\
  \ the deer fall lifeless from its mouth.\n\nWith a look that said, \"Show's over!\"\
  , the leopard dragged its food into the woods, away from our prying eyes.\n\nIt\
  \ took us a moment to break the spell the leopard had cast on us. When we looked\
  \ around, the other gypsies nearby had made it to the scene. But none of them had\
  \ the view that we were fortunate to have.\n\nThe colourful birds, and the wild\
  \ dogs that came upon us as we made our way out of the reserve, could not hold our\
  \ attention long enough for us to forget the spectacle that had unfolded in front\
  \ of our eyes. The silence that followed helped us reflect within ourselves."
