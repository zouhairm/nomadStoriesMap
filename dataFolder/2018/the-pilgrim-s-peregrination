Text: "The pilgrimage in India turns out to be awesome, when you come to know that\
  \ the Hindu mythology comprise various gods along with their unique characters,\
  \ stories and powers.That means, more divine spirituals to explore and more levels\
  \ of serenity to attain.Finally, leading to \u2018moksha\u2019(liberation from cycle\
  \ of death and rebirth).\n\n\u201CNo Hindu\u2019s journey is complete without a\
  \ pilgrimage to both Varanasi and Rameswaram\u201D,a common saying.\n\nNow we were\
  \ traveling somewhere in the coastal region of Tamil Nadu known as Ramanathapuram\
  \ to reach Rameswaram, the ancient temple of lord Shiva and the actual place where\
  \ the Hindu God Rama built a bridge across the sea known as Rama\u2019s bridge towards\
  \ Lanka to rescue his wife Sita from her abductor Ravana according to our ancient\
  \ Hindu mythology \u2018Ramayana\u2019.\n\nSurprisingly we found a friendly local\
  \ guide in Ramanathapuram. Gladly, he invited us to his house before starting the\
  \ journey.To reach his house, we walked on the sand dunes coated with red color\
  \ by the nature and the house was entirely different as it depicted the vintage\
  \ style of construction.It was a huge hut split into two with an open area at the\
  \ middle without any rooftop.Then I came to know that the two portions belonged\
  \ to elder and younger brothers\u2019 families respectively and their parents will\
  \ stay interchangeably on their own wish.\n\nThe most important spot is the middle\
  \ open area which is allocated for sharing their thoughts, knowledge, love and inner\
  \ peace as they all gather there for a dinner including all family members daily.\n\
  \nYeah, it\u2019s absolutely the vintage dining table installed above the dunes\
  \ of red sand and below the pile of stars.\n\nLater our journey in exploring the\
  \ localities and temples of Ramanathapuram was temporarily paused to fill our stomach.We\
  \ had readily packed food as we\u2019re currently travelling on a road which was\
  \ only man-made and the rest was fully surrounded by dense and sparse forest with\
  \ tall eucalyptus and palm trees.Suddenly we heard a raging sound of thunder falling\
  \ upon us, but the sky was clear with a glowing sun resisting our eyes to see upwards.Then\
  \ we found that the sound was emerging from the deep forest.\n\nWe carefully headed\
  \ inwards to witness the well grown herd of horses running towards somewhere far\
  \ away from our presence with a long mane flitted like waves emerging from the sea.They\
  \ might be in search of food some meaningful thing in their life.This sight induced\
  \ our mind to run freely in life with hope towards success."
