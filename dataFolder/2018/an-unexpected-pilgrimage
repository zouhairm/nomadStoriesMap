Text: "On my trip to Mana and Vasudhara falls in Uttarakhand, India, me and my friends\
  \ found ourselves spending a night in a cave with a yogi known as \u201CBheempul\
  \ ke baba\u201D or the baba of Bheempul.\nWe were looking for a place to stay after\
  \ a long days trek and happened upon this yogi who offered us his cave for the night\
  \ to crash in. His cave was up in the mountains, an hour's trek from the nearest\
  \ village. It was a small cave with three rooms. The cave was dark with just an\
  \ oil lamp burning in the room. Fear took over us all. Here we were in a cave God\
  \ knows where with a man in a loin cloth covered in ashes.  He made lemon tea for\
  \ us. As we sat here with our glasses of lemon tea I could feel the tension in the\
  \ room. None of us were drinking the tea. What if he has spiked the tea? I whispered\
  \ to my friend\u2019s ear \u201CI drink the tea and you don\u2019t.  That way at\
  \ least one of us is awake if there is something in the tea. Then the yogi cut some\
  \ mangoes for us. He cursed like a sailor which I didn\u2019t expect at all coming\
  \ from a holy man. As we kept on talking he continued on to say how he is planning\
  \ to expand the cave so that he could help accommodate more travellers like us.\
  \ \nHe then served us dinner. Rice, dal, rotis, two kinds of vegetables and after\
  \ dinner he cut up a few bananas and mangoes and presented them as desert.  We sat\
  \ and talked well into the night. Finally we went to sleep. By the end of it all\
  \ our apprehensions, all our fear had vanished and I slept like a baby. \nIn the\
  \ morning we woke up and a hot kettle of lemon tea was already on the fire. He served\
  \ us tea. After all of us had our tea we informed him we were ready to leave but\
  \ he insisted we have breakfast first. So we had breakfast with him which comprised\
  \ of bread, butter, mangoes, bananas and tea. When we were leaving we offered to\
  \ pay him for his troubles but he wouldn\u2019t accept any money. He said we were\
  \ always welcome to come and stay at his humble cave whenever we wanted.\nThe hospitality\
  \ of the naked sadhu astounded me. Here was a seemingly destitute guy, a guy who\
  \ had literally no clothes on his back and yet he had so much to give. Yes the mattresses\
  \ were a little scratchy, his cave was dark, small and cold but I feel my night\
  \ in a cave with Bhimpul ke Baba was one of the most fulfilling experiences in my\
  \ life. \nSo, if ever you are in Mana, go meet Bhimpul ke Baba. You may learn something;\
  \ find something, an interesting tale to tell, a friend, faith in humanity. I found\
  \ all three."
