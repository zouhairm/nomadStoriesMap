Text: "Summer 2010 I left Gaza strip, one of the most densely stressed places in the\
  \ world. It was an exhausting trip to go through two countries;Russia and Egypt,\
  \ in other words, I had to cross Asia, Africa and Europe to get to Cuba. Finally,\
  \ I arrived in Havana leaving everything behind in Gaza strip, Palestine. \nComing\
  \ from a conservative, traditional and homogeneous society that diversity in all\
  \ its forms has no meaning in my Gazans society. At the age of 18 back then, It\
  \ was little bite of struggle to make that decision that changed my perspectives\
  \ for the better to understand the world in a bigger picture. My instinctive to\
  \ explore, learn and discover new things were my incentives to take such an opportunity\
  \ that transformed my life for the better.\nWith a beautiful smile, at Jose Marti\
  \ international airport,  I was welcomed by an employee of the school where I would\
  \ spend 3 years in such an exciting environment where diversity in all its forms\
  \ is very high such as, ethnicity, religious and political beliefs, socioeconomic\
  \ classes, languages and nationalities.\n\nThe International medical school is more\
  \ welcoming to minorities and marginalized communities from 100 nationalities. Being\
  \ in such a diverse school was a real and authentic experience of accepting others\
  \ who are just different in their way of life.  My school was first place that gave\
  \ me the opportunity to explore, see, feel, live and understand the essence of the\
  \ incredible diversity of our world. One of my friends gave me an advice that I\
  \ always followed, he said this place is like a garden; pick as much flowers as\
  \ you can to keep the spring inside you. \nWith bug repellent, a hat to shade my\
  \ skin from the intense sunny days and a little Cuban pesos I started the journey.\
  \ In my way out of the school to old Havana, the old American and Russian cars,\
  \ the ancient architecture and the simplicity of the people gave me the sensation\
  \ of going back in time, everything here indicates that the life stopped 50 years\
  \ ago.  while walking around the streets of Havana, I enjoyed their real and genuine\
  \ way of life, \n\nThis experience has been the most transformative one I have ever\
  \ had on both personal and academic levels, it indeed enabled me to become a better\
  \ person and a better doctor of science and consciences with more humanitarian principals\
  \ and high level of knowledge about the world\u2019s main challenges and the ways\
  \ to confront them based on other\u2019s traditions, cultures, religions and ways\
  \ of life."
