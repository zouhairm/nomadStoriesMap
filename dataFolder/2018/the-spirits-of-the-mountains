Text: "\u201C\xA1Buenos d\xEDas!\u201D came from outside the tent as I sat up and\
  \ unzipped the door. Our local guide Toribio was squatting outside in his down jacket\
  \ and wooly hat, holding a steaming cup of coca tea. I groaned and lay back down,\
  \ clutching the tin mug as I pulled it close to my face. The steam soothed my tired,\
  \ dry skin and\_the heat eased my headache slightly. We had camped at over 3,800m\
  \ in the Lares Valley in Peru and waking up with a headache had become routine.\
  \ The sky was beginning to get lighter and the remains of the cold night air whisked\
  \ into the tent through the open door. Droplets of water dripped onto my face as\
  \ the steam from my tea melted the ice above my head; time to get up and get moving!\n\
  \nThe village of Canchacancha would be our next camp destination. As a local to\
  \ the village, Toribio was eagerly awaiting today\u2019s hike. He was proud to show\
  \ us his home and the mountains; his childhood playground. \u201CQuinoa and pancake\
  \ for eat! Then Condor Pass waits us!\u201D His face creased into an excited grin\
  \ as we ate breakfast and prepared for the day.\n\nI watched the lake next to our\
  \ camping spot slowly disappear as we climbed higher into the mountains, drained\
  \ of energy and oxygen and stopping regularly to recharge. Eventually, we passed\
  \ the snow line and trudged onwards to Condor Pass at 4,680m. More coca tea was\
  \ poured to celebrate this feat. I perched on an icy rock. The majestic glacier\
  \ stood in front of us, with beautiful views of Pitusiray Mountain and the surrounding\
  \ Andes trailing off into endless peaks and valleys. I slowly sipped the tea. How\
  \ undeserving I felt to be proud of covering such a small part of this vast mountain\
  \ range. Toribio sat quietly, gazing fondly at the view, at home in the harsh conditions.\
  \ Before our descent into the valley, he moved closer to me, took my hands and opened\
  \ my palms. \u201CHere, take kintu\u201D. Into them, he placed three coca leaves\
  \ and took three for himself. I copied as he spread them into a fan and brought\
  \ them first to his face \u201CFor us!\u201D he said. He then held them high, \u201C\
  For skies!\u201D and finally towards the mountains \u201CFor Pachamama!\u201D (Mother\
  \ Earth). The kintu is an ancient offering in which the Incas gave back to the spirits\
  \ of the mountains; a way of restoring reciprocity between humans and nature. We\
  \ let go of the leaves and I watched them float away in the mountain air. I looked\
  \ at Toribio, the skies and the mountains and felt an instant, deep connection.\
  \ I felt calm, content and at one with the Pachamama."
