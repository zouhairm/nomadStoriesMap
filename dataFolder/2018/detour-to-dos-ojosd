Text: "I had only been in Mexico a few days when I arrived in Tulum. It is the best\
  \ jumping off point to discover the many Cenotes (caves created by meteors) that\
  \ dot this coastline.\n\nI decided to travel to the Dos Ojos cenote with Ben who\
  \ I had befriended a few days earlier. When we arrived we were approached by a tall\
  \ man with long hair. He asked if we were 'the guys', \"yes\" Ben blurted out, I\
  \ decided to go along with it, \"so here's the plan\". He went to explain how we\
  \ were going to walk about an hour into the jungle with a group to a private Cenote\
  \ owned by a Danish. We would spend some time with him & then we would perform the\
  \ ceremony & take the medicine. \"What's the medicine?\" we enquired. He realized\
  \ then that we were not 'the guys' but nonetheless invited us along anyway. I reasoned\
  \ that I wouldn't have to take any 'medicine' if I didn't feel like it. \n\nDuring\
  \ the walk, the shaman described how a wealthy Dane with an interest in spirituality\
  \ had purchased the cenote & wanted it 'cleansed'. The medicine itself is a paste\
  \ made from the root of a tree they called Aweybo (grandfather). Amongst its components\
  \ are Seratonin - the happy hormone, & DMT - the powerful hallucinogenic. The shaman\
  \ explained that this had been used for thousands of years. He said that if the\
  \ medicine decides to embrace you, you will feel a deep understanding that every\
  \ particle & unit of energy in the universe is infinite & that every person is an\
  \ expression of the universe within a specific place & time.\n\nThe Cenote itself\
  \ was small, it had a wide mouth that opened onto the jungle and provided lots of\
  \ light. The floor was submerged in shallow water. We were joined by the smartly\
  \ dressed owner. He gave the group a tour of the cave & a guided meditation, he\
  \ also spoke about aliens & David Icke, I smiled & nodded & felt awkward. After\
  \ he left the atmosphere became pleasant as the group got to know one another.\n\
  \nWe were given stones which we projected positive energy into before burying, we\
  \ were smudged with the smoke & we chanted about love. When it was time to smoke\
  \ the medicine, I turned to Ben to say I couldn't do it but he wouldn't accept my\
  \ answer. I took 4 inhales. Inside I felt a deep connection to the people sitting\
  \ with me. The trip gave me perspective & peace as I sat with a large smile on my\
  \ face holding my new friends' hands. The lesson was an understanding of the power\
  \ of my actions, that projecting love into the world can have a positive impact\
  \ beyond what you may realize."
