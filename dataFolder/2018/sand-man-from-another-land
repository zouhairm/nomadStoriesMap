Text: "I met a man on the beach.\nHe came over wearing aged tattered clothing that\
  \ had long lost their colour, the same way he seemed to have lost his spirits.\n\
  He asked my friend and I if we were interested in getting henna tattoos and presented\
  \ us with a book of all the different patterns and designs we could choose from.\n\
  As he sat on the sand opposite us with his back to the sea, I watched as he began\
  \ painting the black paste onto her wrist.\nConversation taught us his story.\n\
  He was selling his services as a henna artist in order to get by. A slow and risky\
  \ business where he is constantly having to keep a watchful eye out for the police.\n\
  He told us that he was from Pakistan and that he missed being back home.\n\u201C\
  Why did you come here?\u201D We asked.\n\u201CMoney.\u201D He replied.\nThis was\
  \ how he was making his living. I could see the pain behind his eyes, the saddness\
  \ masked in his voice and I wish I could have done more, perhaps said something\
  \ more to save this man from living a life that had been reduced to this bland and\
  \ repetitive cycle.\nThere we were on holiday, gazing at the dying sun sinking into\
  \ the blue horizon \u2013 a rare and wonderful sight to two city girls, and there\
  \ before us was a middle-aged man who had seen the same sun and had walked the same\
  \ lengths of the golden stretch of sand a thousand times. All we could do was empathise\
  \ and shake our heads disapprovingly at life\u2019s harsh realities.\n\u201CWhat\
  \ about your wife?\u201D We pondered.\n\u201CNo wife.\u201D He smiled. \u201CYou\
  \ can be my wife.\u201D\nI watched the concentration on his face as he paid attention\
  \ to each detail. This was his life. The black form on her wrist began to take shape\
  \ into the anchor that had been promised. The tattoo was complete and so was his\
  \ business with us.\nBefore he left, he gave us a final look of appreciation.\n\u201C\
  Thank you.\u201D He said. \u201CYou respect me.\u201D\nThese words I swear I\u2019\
  ll take to my grave.\nWe watched as he unfolded his legs and moved across the sands\
  \ in his beaten slippers calling Henna to unseeing sunbathers.\nI know I probably\
  \ won\u2019t see that man again,\nbut sir,\nI hope life treats you well."
