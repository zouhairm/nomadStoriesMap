Text: "Before embarking on a journey to several South East Asian Countries several\
  \ months ago, I had decided not to equip my cellphone with internet connection.\
  \ I wanted to have an authentic journey where I could experience everything through\
  \ my own two eyes, not through several inches of cellphone screen. I was ready to\
  \ rely merely on wi-fi provided by the places where I'd stay.\n\nIn Saigon, my guesthouse\
  \ didn't have wi-fi so, for nearly a week, I couldn't send even a single line of\
  \ WhatApp text to my girlfriend. You bet. She was worried she even Googled me, in\
  \ case something bad had happened to her beloved partner--yes, that's me. Fortunately,\
  \ in a public bus taking me from Saigon to Phnom Penh there was a wi-fi connection.\
  \ My girlfriend was relieved knowing that I was still alive.\n\nArriving in Phnom\
  \ Penh, I was again offline for several days. For me, it was no problem at all.\
  \ It was what I'd been seeking, after all--days without the internet. I really enjoyed\
  \ strolling around Phnom Penh and Tonle Sap river without frequently checking my\
  \ pocket to see if there were any messages on my phone. It felt nostalgic. The last\
  \ time I'd felt this way was when I was in junior high.\n\nFrom Phnom Penh, I went\
  \ to Siem Reap. Thinking about it now, I'm not sure whether what happened to me\
  \ in Siem Reap was a serendipity or bad luck: I stayed for several days in a really\
  \ cozy dormitory having a strong wi-fi connection. Meeting fellow travelers saying\
  \ that they were really helped by the hotel-booking applications made me interested\
  \ to try for myself. It'd be nice if I had already known where to stay before arriving\
  \ in Bangkok, ny next destination.\n\nScrolling for a while, I found a nice dormitory\
  \ and pressed \"book now.\" A notification came, saying I had already booked a bed.\
  \ All I had to do next was finding the place somewhere in Sukhumvit Rd., Bangkok.\n\
  \nLong story short, I arrived in Bangkok. From Hua Lamphong, I took an MRT to Sukhumvit\
  \ Rd., walking from 23rd Sukhumvit to 39th where my guesthouse supposed to be located.\
  \ After I'd walked the whole length of 39th Sukhumvit twice, I couldn't spot any\
  \ signs of the guesthouse. \n\nIn the end, I strolled aimlessly through Bangkok\
  \ with no particular destination. The night was already late. In a corner, I spotted\
  \ a highway post. Finding it was empty, I spread my sleeping bag on the patio and\
  \ slept a couple hour. If my cellphone were equipped with an internet connection,\
  \ it'd be easy for me to find it. I should've had an internet connection."
