Text: "I couldn\u2019t fathom if it was anger or distress that had catapulted within\
  \ me as I stepped out of the Embassy. A visa agent later informed that being a single\
  \ girl from a third world country posed a potential immigrant threat.\"Makes sense.\
  \ I know someone who faked a marriage during a vacation just to immigrate\", a friend\
  \ added. \u201CAre you kidding me?\u201D I got a mini heart attack. Having spent\
  \ 27 years in India, I was unable to coax a man into marrying me. Meanwhile, the\
  \ Spanish Embassy was convinced that ten days in their country was good enough for\
  \ me to find a husband. However, the idea of having a Spanish husband like William\
  \ Levy seemed pretty enticing, I wouldn't deny!\nThe visa rejection led me to plan\
  \ a backpacking trip to Rajasthan which I had been long postponing. I boarded an\
  \ overnight bus from Delhi to Pushkar.On reaching the bus station, the autowallahs\
  \ clamored around me assuming I was a foreigner. It is surprising that in a country\
  \ obsessed with fairness creams, my chocolate skin was being perceived as exotic.\"\
  I charging very minimum\" said one guy. I boarded his auto and on reaching the hostel,\
  \ realized that I had no cash \nWalking along the streets of Pushkar in search of\
  \ an ATM, made me feel like Alice who had tumbled her way into Wonderland. The narrow\
  \ streets were lined with the prettiest of shops that looked like an Instagrammer's\
  \ dream. Long haired Hippies were smoking cannabis everywhere. I finally managed\
  \ to find an ATM but noticed a girl inside banging the machine out of frustration.\
  \ She had blonde hair and green eyes and was wearing the most uncoordinated Indian\
  \ clothes. \u201CNo cash in any of the ATMs\u201D, she said with a heavy Spanish\
  \ accent and suggested that we walk further to find another. \u201CI am Lila from\
  \ Cordoba, Spain\u201D, she introduced herself. \u201CAh, I was supposed to go to\
  \ Spain but your..\u201D I began my story when she suddenly hid her face with a\
  \ scarf and started walking faster, nudging me to follow.\u201CLila, what happened?\u201D\
  \ I asked. She discreetly pointed to a bunch of men who were walking towards us.\
  \ \u201CThey have been stalking me all day\u201D, Lila said. As we neared, one of\
  \ them passed a very suggestive remark, assuming me to be a foreigner as well. \u201C\
  This is it\u201D, I thought to myself. In that spur of the moment, I turned around\
  \ and grabbed the guy by the collar. \nConsidering my petite frame, he seemed like\
  \ a behemoth. Undeterred, I leaped and punched his face hard. \nTheir Embassy might\
  \ have denied me a visa, but I made a Spanish friend for life!"
