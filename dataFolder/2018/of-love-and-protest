Text: "\u201CTake the money.\u201D  \n\nThe sharp grief in his eyes could cut glass.\
  \ He shakes his head, no.\n\n\u201CTake the money.\u201D I pull out 900 yuan, roughly\
  \ 100 USD. \u201CWe are friends. Don\u2019t worry, we are friends.\u201D\n\nI first\
  \ met Dashi at the bus station in Xiahe, in the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Gansu\
  \ Province, China. I had just arrived from Lanzhou, after four hours crammed next\
  \ to happily cigarette-smoking Han Chinese. They smoked the entire way, and I spent\
  \ the time with my head out the window, sucking in what fresh air I could, like\
  \ a coy fish sucking in water.\n\n\u201CBreathing\u201D had left me no time for\
  \ my usual in-transit task: to research a place to stay in the next town. Deboarding,\
  \ I threw my backpack on the ground, collapsed on top of it, and began to peruse\
  \ the pages of my Lonely Planet.\n\nA young man in a leather bomber jacket stared\
  \ at me. He was darker than most Han, and I surmised he was Tibetan.\n\nI spun around\
  \ on my backpack so he couldn\u2019t look at me, but he moved too. I turned some\
  \ more. So did he.\n\n\u201CWhat are you doing?\u201D I asked him finally, in Mandarin.\n\
  \n\u201CI am looking at your book, to figure out where you are going.\u201D \n\n\
  He was serious. I laughed. \u201CCan you take me here?\u201D  \n\nHe squinted at\
  \ the address on the page.  \n\n\u201CYes,\u201D he said. And off we went.\n\nThat\
  \ was Dashi. We sped down Main Street on his three-wheeler, the wooden buildings\
  \ like something out of an old Western movie, save the red Buddhist awnings. Once\
  \ out of the city,  the grasslands opened up to the most uncivilized blue sky I\
  \ had ever seen. Little did I know, Dashi would take me back to those grasslands,\
  \ make me a crown of white flowers. We would sit, watching the locals ride horses\
  \ bareback, and I would forget what century I lived in, what country I came from.\n\
  \  \nDashi was actually half Tibetan. His Han father had married a Tibetan woman,\
  \ out of love and protest.  \n\n\u201CI hate the Han,\u201D Dashi\u2019s father\
  \ told me when we met. \u201CAll they care about is money.\u201D\n\nThen he smiled\
  \ slyly, gestured to his son.\n\n\u201CHe is a good boy. Take him to America.\u201D\
  \n\nWe both knew I couldn\u2019t do that.\n\nI could only give Dashi money, such\
  \ a poor substitute. And even though he needed it desperately I had to shove it\
  \ into his pocket. In return, \nDashi gave me the Main Street address of his friend\u2019\
  s store, at that time his only contact point. And I left for Xinjiang.\n\nTwo weeks\
  \ later I returned through Xiahe. The bus didn\u2019t stop, but I could see that\
  \ the entire main street had been leveled. China\u2019s urban reform.\n\nHis friend\u2019\
  s store was gone."
