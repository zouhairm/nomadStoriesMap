Text: "Let me start by saying - I fly airplanes for living. Traveling & exploring\
  \ new places, cultures & cuisines is what I am always ready for. \nIt was the first\
  \ time I was traveling to Portugal. The only other time I had been to Europe was\
  \ during a transit layover turned into a 6 day trip through Zurich.\nBorn & raised\
  \ in India,  I hold a Indian Passport - which also means I require planning ahead\
  \ where I want to visit since I require a visa for most places.\nThat being said\
  \ - I usually just plan where I want to go,  get the visa & rest is all in the air.\n\
  I took the flight to Lisbon from Philadelphia International Airport in May 2016.\
  \ I was excited for this trip.\nArrived early morning at the airport. After getting\
  \ through the immigration & customs. I walk to information booth to figure out how\
  \ to get to our Airbnb. Well, it was just a few minutes ride in the metro. I was\
  \ told to go get the ticket from kiosk since it had option to choose in English\
  \ language. \nI choose the destination & now its time to make the payment. I insert\
  \ my \"World travel Card\" but, the machine is asking for 6 digit code. I am not\
  \ sure why is it asking for a 6 digit code since all my cards have only 4 digit\
  \ codes. I take my card out & try again. Same message. I put in my 4 digit code\
  \ followed by \"00\" - Denied! I try again but, this time I add \"00\" before my\
  \ code - Denied Again!\nI am confused - wondering why is this happening. I go to\
  \ the customer service for the metro. Ask them to give me a ticket for the destination\
  \ hoping they would just swipe my card & I wouldn't have to enter any code. But,\
  \ they handed me the card machine to punch in the code. And, of course it doesn't\
  \ work again. \nFrom my past experiences - I never carried much cash. I mostly relied\
  \ on my world card to work everywhere. I call my bank - explain them the situation.\
  \ Only to hear the Bank associate tell me - \"Oh that card doesn't work in Portugal\"\
  . It's one of the few places our card has no tie up with any local bank.\" I am\
  \ like - You should change the name to \"Most world card\". \nI start looking for\
  \ all the change & dollar bills I had in my pocket & bag. I was able to bring around\
  \ $30 together. Enough to get around \u20AC25.Finally able to buy that metro ticket.\
  \ Now I am on my way to my Airbnb - thinking how am I going to spend the next 1\
  \ week in a country that doesn't accept my card & I have no cash!\nNot very smart!\n\
  I didn't mention earlier - I was traveling with my wife! Yup - I am still alive\
  \ & we're still together!"
