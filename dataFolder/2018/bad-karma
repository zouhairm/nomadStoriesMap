Text: "Hello people from all over the world . \nThe next traveling story that I will\
  \ shsre with you was happening while I was \ntraveling from Germany to Netherlands\
  \ for a job . \nIt was in the end of the autumn and / or  beginining of the winter\
  \ of 2017  . \nIt was a cold rainy day . Also there were quite a few gray fluffy\
  \ clouds ....\nshowing up on the horison . \nI was traveling by train . At that\
  \ moment I was on a platform of a city close \nto Erfurt . I don t remember clearly\
  \ which one .\nI was checking up my email , stoped had a zip of coke ., and than\
  \ I heard \nsome noises nearby . It was a woman  with her 2 boys crying and fighting\
  \ \nbetween each other verbally . They were lost ...for some reason . \nIn a few\
  \ seconds they were aproching me and asking me to guide them , \nhelp them reach\
  \ their home cause she was lost and confused and didn t \nknow how to get home .\
  \  \"Home\" - was  Erfurt .\nWe were on a german train station . The woman was of\
  \ arabic origin and \ndidn t speak English or German . \nAll she had to do was get\
  \ on snother platform. From there get a train to Erfurt ,\n stop there and than\
  \ take another trai to Gro\xDFe...something.(i forgot) . Well ....\nI had to go\
  \ with her cause she was still crying and talk in tongues..that i don t\n understand\
  \ . And I told her to stop,,, actually screamed at her and then explain\n to her\
  \ like ...talking to a baby . She understood ! \nI got back on my platform ...just\
  \ in time to loose my train. \nI had to spend the nite on a train station !!! \n\
  No train till the second day . I wasn t expecting that at all  . In fact that was\
  \ the \nlast thing on my mind . I couldn t believe it . All of a sudden my face\
  \ changed \nceveral colours and I was very upset and started mumbling some not very\
  \ nice\n words out of frustrations , nervs , feeling bad about my situation at that\
  \ time ,\nbut also good because I could do something useful to help someone who\
  \ really\n needed ., all at the same time . \nBad luck , karma , watever...all I\
  \ can tell you it didn t felt so great !!!\nBut ... after a few moments of anger\
  \ or agony or watever you want to call it \n......reviewing all that occured , I\
  \ think that probably was a good thing that I\n helped her even if I lost my train\
  \ ., because in Germany the locals as  \nyou probably know already people are very\
  \ cold and not willing to help or share\n experiences with nobody other than their\
  \ family and close friends .\nAnd even if they would wanted to help her they couldn\
  \ t because of the language\n barrier ."
