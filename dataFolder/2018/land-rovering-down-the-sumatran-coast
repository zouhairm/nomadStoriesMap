Text: "We said yes to fate over a banana pancake in West Sumatra. We, being my boyfriend\
  \ and I, but in Muslim Sumatra, we, being my husband and I. We said yes, and consequently,\
  \ we spent the next several days in a \u201869 Land Rover piloted by a retired tsunami\
  \ Red Cross relief worker, now business owner, philosopher, and a maniacal genius\
  \ of a driver. \n\nLike a cat, Raqay had suddenly appeared opposite of us in the\
  \ idyllic cafe he owns nestled in the Sianok Canyon outside of Bukittinggi. And\
  \ after a meandering conversation, he subtly proposed we join him on an adventurous\
  \ trip to an undisclosed island location. \n\nWell it didn\u2019t seem wise to not\
  \ look a serendipitous gift horse in the mouth, so it was decided we would join\
  \ this handsome, dreadlocked Indonesian man for an adventure. \n\nOver the next\
  \ several days we drove through West Sumatra in his roaring, tarnished fortress\
  \ of a Land Rover, sharing philosophical discussions over the cacophonous acceleration\
  \ into 3rd gear and symphony of horns Raqay\u2019s anarchist style of driving would\
  \ receive. \u201CAnd that is why I think Indonesia has never excelled in athletics,\u201D\
  \ he would say as he passed a line of cars by bombarding through a construction\
  \ site and narrowly avoiding pancaking three families on scooters, \u201Cbecause\
  \ in the Muslim religion it is forbidden to use the left hand.\u201D \n\nThe drive\
  \ went on, and the great greying Land Rover bounded along the West Sumatran coast.\
  \ He spoke of fighting to get tarpaulin after the 2004 tsunami, ultimately bringing\
  \ in armed security officers into the Red Cross headquarters in order to be heard,\
  \ and then watching as the relief effort became dominated by businessmen rather\
  \ than humanitarians. \n\nRaqay reminded me of the original statesman. He loved\
  \ his country deeply and was involved in her future. As he drove us through the\
  \ rice patties of a silversmithing village, a wriggling line of traffic extending\
  \ past the volcanoes wrapped in thick, unyielding jungle, he would turn to us from\
  \ the driver\u2019s seat and beam, \u201CIsn\u2019t Bukittinggi wonderful?\u201D\
  \ And then he would stop and talk to the bridge builders to see how they were coming\
  \ along and correct their design. \n\nAs a tourist, too often I\u2019m stuck an\
  \ arm\u2019s length away from what I\u2019m trying to explore. Raqay pulled us in\
  \ and introduced us to his people and his land, and through his love of his home,\
  \ I fell in love. So yes Raqay, Bukittinggi is wonderful and I look forward to spending\
  \ countless more hours bouncing along with that Rover\u2019s dogged gears."
