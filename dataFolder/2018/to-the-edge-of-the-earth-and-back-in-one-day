Text: "I arrive at the Albuquerque bus station with just enough time to grab breakfast\
  \ out of a vending machine before catching my 4:30 AM ride. This is my version of\
  \ a road trip. \n\nI don't know why the others on this bus are venturing to the\
  \ Chihuahuan Desert today, but I'm confident I'm the only one going to see White\
  \ Sands.\n\nWe reach border control a few hours into the ride. Three men with uniforms\
  \ and guns ask me if I'm a US citizen. I feel like I'm in trouble, despite knowing\
  \ that the most rebellious law-breaking I do is ignoring the occasional stop sign\
  \ on my bicycle.\n\nWe finally arrive at Alamogordo's version of Port Authority,\
  \ which is a gas station. The only other vehicle here is cow-filled truck. \n\n\
  I call a taxi, which turns out to be young woman driving a black Volvo with a crucifix\
  \ dangling from the rearview mirror. \n\nWe drive to the desert, and she releases\
  \ me to wander. \n\nI read that the sand would be cool, but they lied. It's the\
  \ hottest day this year, and the gorgeous white powder attacks my feet like snow\
  \ from hell. It cools as I hike further and my feet sink deeper into the dunes,\
  \ causing an avalanche of sand to bury my calves. \n\nThere's something about the\
  \ simplicity of sand dunes. The sugary waves of white contrast with the San Francisco\
  \ pavement I'm used to. This is what standing on the moon must feel like. For this\
  \ moment, I'm the only one in the universe. \n\nBack at the gas station, I'm told\
  \ my bus will be three hours late. Two guys smoking e-cigarettes invite me to join\
  \ them on the floor to play Gin Rummy.\n\nThree hours, two bags of Cracker Jacks,\
  \ and a Coors later, I'm on my way back to Albuquerque. It's almost midnight.\n\n\
  Unlike my earlier rides, this one is packed. I get the last seat, conveniently next\
  \ to an ex-convict. I set my alarm for 3:00 AM and close my eyes, hoping I don't\
  \ take an uninvited snooze on his shoulder. If I miss my stop, I'll wake up in Colorado.\n\
  \nI admit, for a moment, I question whether this was worth it. Tomorrow, I'll know\
  \ it was. While speeding down the desert highway with a friend blasting \"Unknown\
  \ Legend\" from the comfort of our car would have been glorious, I would have missed\
  \ these interactions with strangers in this crazy, unfamiliar, sometimes uncomfortable\
  \ world of Greyhounds and gas stations and ex-convicts. The journey is the destination.\n\
  \nIt's wonderful to learn that I don't have to leave the continent to experience\
  \ this rush--that it's not where I am or how I'm getting there--it's just that I'm\
  \ going."
