Text: "\u201CYou don\u2019t have to do this,\u201D and \u201CYou\u2019re crazy,\u201D\
  \ were phrases I heard when people discovered I joined Peace Corps. In January 2014,\
  \ I was invited to serve in China and prepared to leave in June 2014 thus beginning\
  \ the derivation of expectations.\n\nWhen I joined, I expected to change the world\
  \ and have the profound love of my students. I expected to travel to 22 places that\
  \ looked good in photos without knowing where those pins dropped on the map. I expected\
  \ to learn Mandarin easily. I expected to find the love of my life. All except one\
  \ of those was the opposite of what I expected.\n\nThe most monumental adventure\
  \ of my life was the biggest surprise of all. Viewing the odd symbols on signs and\
  \ watching foreign words fall off the lips of the natives, I knew the terrifying\
  \ pain of illiteracy. A simple task of ordering food easily sparked panic attacks\
  \ and I wondered if I could do this. \n\nI went through training of language, cross-cultural\
  \ relations and asked the \u2018why?\u2019 China did this and that. But even with\
  \ the answers, I wasn\u2019t getting what I expected. I missed my home. I thought\
  \ of Colorado and the mountains, about breakfast with my dad and the scent of clary\
  \ sage when I embraced my mom. I remembered when dad took me to the airport and\
  \ how mom didn\u2019t go. I knew it would be hard, but I didn\u2019t know it would\
  \ be this hard.\n\n\u201CDon\u2019t let me quit,\u201D I told them. And I knew they\
  \ would listen...\n\nAfter eight months living in Southern China, I slowly and painfully\
  \ learned Mandarin, learned my students were uninterested in me and spent more of\
  \ my time in my community. I left my home in Chongqing and traveled solo to Beijing\
  \ with intentions to see The Great Wall, The Forbidden City, and The Summer Palace.\
  \ \n\nI brushed the Great Wall stone with my fingertips and was herded like cattle\
  \ through the Forbidden City. But at the Summer Palace, I found love.\n\nAs I wandered\
  \ the Summer Palace, I came upon the Long Corridor, one of the places I pinned on\
  \ my map. I followed the intricately painted corridor to its end until I rested\
  \ my eyes upon the Marble Boat, another one of my pins. The Marble Boat was surrounded\
  \ by vibrant Dragon Boats and the sun shined down on the white lake brightening\
  \ up the bundled bodies ice skating. \n\nWhen I returned to the US 16 months later,\
  \ I had only seen 11 places.\n\nI preferred Chongqing to Beijing. But observing\
  \ the calmness of the lake, I felt a sudden ease in my surroundings. It was the\
  \ last thing I expected, but it\u2019s when I knew\u2026 I was falling in love with\
  \ China."
