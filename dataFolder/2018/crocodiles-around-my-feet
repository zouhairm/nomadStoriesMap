Text: "My heart beat hard, my limbs disobeyed my brain and Jandamarra\u2019s ghost\
  \ was haunting my thoughts. I stood at the edge of the river and paused.\nA river\
  \ where you willingly hitched up your trousers, slipped off your shoes and waded\
  \ into the water knowing there were crocodiles? It was the very last thing I expected\
  \ was safe to do. Behind me a coral reef lurched a 100 metres out of the parched\
  \ Earth, a thousand hues of brown against the azure sky. The jagged teeth and pockmarked\
  \ limestone told tales of a Devonian era of megafauna and more recently of the civil\
  \ war that killed the Aboriginal leader Jandamarra and left many others imprisoned\
  \ in the giant baobab at Derby.\nFor 750 metres, dirty turquoise green water reaches\
  \ thigh high as you hesitatingly wade through the underground tunnel that leads\
  \ under the Napier Range. Small, fish eating Johnstonii crocodiles calmly flee from\
  \ your movement sometimes colliding with your legs in the gloom. Your heart races\
  \ but you cannot help being drawn into the spirit of the tunnel. Cave walls green\
  \ with algal growth arch over your head in the gloom, bats flutter and scramble\
  \ for new rock holds chirping and complaining about your presence, suddenly releasing\
  \ their hold and skimming you in their eagerness to escape the torch beam. Stalactites\
  \ grow down from the ceiling reaching towards the crocodiles in a slow bid for beauty.\n\
  As the glow from the far end of the tunnel begins to light your way, twisted tree\
  \ roots hang curtain-like before you, roots that have pushed through limestone weak\
  \ points in a bid for water, white pebbled sands stretch away from the cool waters\
  \ up to the mound of rubble that has left a great skylight in the roof through which\
  \ seeds and insect colonisers have arrived making their home in the collapsed rocky\
  \ heap.\nClimbing up into the walls you happen upon Aboriginal rock art from the\
  \ late 1890\u2019s, dark ochre colours daubed in the weathered rock depicting frill\
  \ necked lizards, kangaroos and successful hunts. Stick like men full of character\
  \ with bows and arrows in pursuit of shapeless creatures that sprint into limestone\
  \ cavities for shelter. It is here that Jandamarra\u2019s spirit comes to life surrounded\
  \ by the strong warriors that fought for independence against Australia\u2019s colonisers.\
  \ His spirit captured my imagination as I sun-basked on the fallen cave roof, hungry\
  \ crocodiles splashing harmlessly around me and the astonishing underground cave\
  \ system all about me, tunnels into history and our past."
