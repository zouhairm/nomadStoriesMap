Text: "I have been to Cyprus to participate in a youth exchange. I met my italian\
  \ team during the flight to Paphos and a girl, Irene, who was very nice to me.\n\
  When we arrived I fell in love with the island: the blue of the sea mixed with the\
  \ green of the nature formed a suggestive landescape.\nThis small island is rich\
  \ of culture, after all is the land of Aphrodite. After a day spent visiting Aphrodite's\
  \ rocks and the house of Dionysus, we reached the Hotel where we spent the week\
  \ for our training course. It was a big structure on the south cost near Faro beach.\n\
  In the first night we went to that beach with all the international group, we lit\
  \ up a bonfire and Cyprus people started to tell their stories about the island,\
  \ the culture and history of Turkish invasion: currently Cyprus is diveded in two\
  \ parts: the cyprus part and the turkish part always in conflict with each others.\n\
  During the dinner I met other people of the team, it was curious to know about their\
  \ different cultures and stories. My attention have been catched from two portugueses\
  \ brothers who use to live as nomads, they just travel from country to country bringing\
  \ with them their paraglinding. So I asked: \" Guys, why don't you bring me and\
  \ Irene with you for a paragliding excursion?\" My already adventure friend agreed\
  \ with me and the guys could't wait to show us their paragliding skills. So the\
  \ day after, I put the necessary in a backpack and while I was going out I met my\
  \ cyprus room mate: \"Hey, where are you going?\" she asked\n\"Me and the others\
  \ guys are going to visit the island\"\n\"Oh that's a good idea, but be carefull,\
  \ don't go in the turkish zone, it's dangerous\" she said.\n\"Don't worry, we will\
  \ be back for dinner\". \nWe took a bus to greek cape, we walked till the highest\
  \ point, the brothers help me and Irene with harness and 3,2...1! We was flighting\
  \ on the blue sky on the sea, it was the best view I ever see! But when we landed\
  \ we notice that we weren't on the beach where we planned to go. We start to walk\
  \ and walk but we couldn't see the bus anymore and not even a downtown, so we keept\
  \ walking and we arrived to a place with some barrels with weirds signs: we was\
  \ at the border of the turkish zone. I was so worried but we didn't have a choice,\
  \ we had to pass. I aspected the worst but we saw a big circle of people dancing\
  \ and playing turkish music, we went near and a guy with big mustache offered us\
  \ a glass of raki, some minutes later what had semmed so dangerous to us become\
  \ the funniest thing."
