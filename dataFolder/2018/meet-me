Text: "Meet me, young and emotional on the front seat of a big white car with the\
  \ seat belt fastened. I don`t know yet that this road trip will turn out in something\
  \ more than just a ride. Where can a piece of fresh soft cheese with salt eaten\
  \ in a sheepfold for breakfast, some fallen apples collected from the ground in\
  \ a monastery garden for lunch, Sambuca near a bonfire for dinner lead to?\n***\n\
  \u201CRediscovery\u201D was an 8 days trip to the hidden and unreachable places\
  \ of Moldova. \nWe are four of us in our team and we don`t have a plan. We are enjoying\
  \ the ride along the landscapes of Moldova, hills, caves, cliffs, along a land of\
  \ sunflowers burnt to ash, turning into an apple orchard, where we stop to steal\
  \ the round shiny fruits.\nWe drive slowly throw a small village looking for stories.\
  \ It is a special one in the whole country; old believers \u2013 a thousand of a\
  \ kind, sunny people. Small houses with open gates and doors, dusty roads, barefoot\
  \ kids playing with pumpkins and corncobs. We stop near an old Soviet car with two\
  \ people inside an attached open trunk. \nThey are peeling the seeds out from the\
  \ sunflower heads with their bare hands and black small seeds fall in a sack at\
  \ their feet. \n- The real happiness, - a woman tells us. \u2013 is that our children\
  \ don`t leave. Young people fall in love with locals and come to Pocrovca to build\
  \ a life. They don`t look for work in other places. There is always work to be done\
  \ here. \nAfter forty minutes, we turn on the engine and I hear the crunch of gravel\
  \ under the wheels as a melody of sunflower seeds falling into the sack. \n***\n\
  What do you imagine when you say \u201Cpoverty\u201D? Moldova has a description\
  \ of it. It says: \u201CLook at me, I am poor, but hardworking. I am poor, but calm.\
  \ I am poor, so what?\u201D\nSomewhere in the north of the Republic, my mates wash\
  \ the car. I, glossy and spoiled, lay down in the grass. My sneakers absorbed the\
  \ dust of my tiny country. My brain absorbed stories. I will carry them with me\
  \ like a tattoo, like a mark I connected with a local rustic reality. The reality\
  \ in which the happiness is not an eternal introspective search, where happiness\
  \ is kind and simple.\nThere are roads that can be reached just on one-side wheels\
  \ of a car. They will frighten you; they will be disturbing and complicated. \n\
  One day, you, the wanderer, the nomad, will come back to your comfortable nest,\
  \ you will put on your expensive suit, and suddenly you will realize, that under\
  \ it is another you. And you did a great journey to reach it"
