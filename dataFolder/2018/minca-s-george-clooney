Text: "Around he twirled her as her red dress swayed in rhythm, he maneuvered her\
  \ this way and that in full control. The look on his face said it all, this was\
  \ what he lived for, Salsa. \nMi Amigo Manuel, from Minca Colombia, in his 50s,\
  \ dark skin, tall and a soft set of grey wings. Minca\u2019s version of George Clooney.\
  \  \nHe is the caretaker of Hostel Casa Loma, A Hostel situated a steep 15 minute\
  \ climb from the town of Minca. Minca has a population of about 800 and is located\
  \ in the Sierra Nevada Selva, just above Santa Marta. \nManuel is tasked with taking\
  \ care of the grounds in the hostel. He works there 5 days a week while also owning\
  \ his own \u2018Finca\u2019, which is a 2-hour walk through luscious jungle. He\
  \ makes this journey every morning and arrives by 7 but in the evenings Manuel turns\
  \ into the king of Salsa. He heads down to the town and dances up a storm, swapping\
  \ partners numerous times he dazzles from salsa to meringue.\nI was introduced to\
  \ Manuel when I started volunteering in the hostel; I am a Carpenter so I was helping\
  \ to build Caba\xF1as and other jobs around the hostel.  I had travelled in Latin\
  \ America for a total of 10 months at that point and had taken some short intensive\
  \ language courses so my Spanish was ok but with Manuel\u2019s strong accent and\
  \ dialect our initial communication was via sign language.  \n We shared most of\
  \ the day helping each other with various tasks. The language barrier never stopped\
  \ us though, as we always found a way to communicate the messages we wanted to share.\
  \  The hostel was in the jungle so he was always showing me different types of Plants,\
  \ Birds, Insects as well as sharing his knowledge and the history of Minca. Our\
  \ connection surpassed the need for language and after 4 months we knew what the\
  \ other was thinking just by each other's expressions.\nColombia gets attention\
  \ in the media for all the wrong reasons but the true story of Colombia lies in\
  \ the people, their hearts are as warm as the sun and there is a passion for life\
  \ that seems unrivaled in all my travels. \n Manuel showed me what it is to be Colombian,\
  \ his love of his little place in the world is inspirational. In as recent as the\
  \ 80s Minca was occupied by FARC and other paramilitary groups. Lot\u2019s of people\
  \ left and never returned. The town now is a little piece of paradise the new residence\
  \ and the ones who returned are eager to share their culture with anyone who wants\
  \ to experience The True Colombia."
