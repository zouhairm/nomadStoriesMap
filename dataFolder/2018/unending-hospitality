Text: "Mountains rolled by at a sluggish pace as our 4-cylinder car struggled with\
  \ the steep ascents but screamed down the far side.  A curious fox snuck a peek\
  \ between the trees to see what ravenous creature could possibly be making this\
  \ ruckus, but it quickly darted back and out of sight without a second glance. \
  \ That landscape of Kopaonik National Park was truly mesmerizing, but, at this time,\
  \ our host family, who gave us this travel recommendation, won our hearts.\n\nWe\
  \ circled back to Ni\u0161 with the scenery slowly flattening out.  As our car approached\
  \ our accommodation, Matija appeared with his smile that would welcome his worst\
  \ enemy, if he even had one, to stay under his roof.\n\nComing to Serbia, we had\
  \ little expectation of what relations we would make, but the overflowing hospitality\
  \ of Matija\u2019s family and friends covered us like a warm blanket in the dead\
  \ of winter.\n\n\u201CI park the car.\u201D  He said without any room for excuse\
  \ as he stood in front without budging.  As I gladly gave in to the bigger man,\
  \ I soon found a beer in my hand and was kindly told to sit down at their patio\
  \ table.  \u201CBurek will be here soon.  Have you had before?  No?  You will never\
  \ leave Serbia after you have it.\u201D\n\nHis wife, Petra, came out of the door\
  \ handling far too many cups and plates filled with Serbian delicacies.  \u201C\
  Matija, you need to work on your English.\u201D  She scolded her husband as she\
  \ set out coffee and a walnut liqueur her neighbor made.\n\n\u201CYou will come\
  \ back to Serbia, yes?\u201D  Matija asked as he came to the table.  \u201CI pay\
  \ for your tickets.  You see Ni\u0161 in the summer and stay with us again.\u201D\
  \n\nBefore we could answer, the table filled with Matija\u2019s family and neighbors\
  \ as their dogs padded between guests waiting for the friendly pat or table scrap.\
  \  As everyone\u2019s cheeks began to take on a slightly reddish hue due to possibly\
  \ one too many drinks, the hospitality did not end.\n\n\u201CYou will see my workshop?\u201D\
  \  Matija questioned and gave us the grand tour of his metal working with countless\
  \ souvenirs graciously placed in our already overstuffed bags.\n\n\u201CMy son will\
  \ take over one day.\u201D  He said as we made our way back to the rest of the group.\
  \  Deep passion colored his eyes as he looked from his workshop to his son laughing\
  \ at a joke made from his friend.\n\nWe may have been thousands of miles from our\
  \ own family and friends, but I still cannot recall a time where I was more welcomed\
  \ and doted over than in the ever-hospitable Serbia.  Maybe we will take Matija\
  \ up on those return tickets."
