Text: "Pilgrims walk the streets of Rome, the Mecca of the Christian world, looking\
  \ for blessings and meanings in the thousands of churches built by those who came\
  \ before us. Rome is a city of prayers, and I think that believers and non-believers\
  \ alike make prayers here, some in the form of wishes, when they cast their coins\
  \ into the sloshing blue waters of the mystical fountain.  I watch as these pilgrims\
  \ cast their coins into the clear cascade of drowning wishes at the Trevi fountain,\
  \ and I find myself wondering what they would wish for. \n\nThe late afternoon sun\
  \ was deepening, as I wandered aimlessly down the narrow streets behind the Trevi\
  \ Fountain. The air was cool and sheltered by tall stone buildings, and local people\
  \ went about their day, seemingly oblivious to the fact that they were part of the\
  \ attraction that bought travellers to this beautiful city. These people, like the\
  \ Pilgrims, may also be on a journey, looking for blessings and meaning, but perhaps\
  \ theirs couldn\u2019t be found within the walls of a church. \n\nI walked the filling\
  \ streets, past the elaborate gold-plated entrances to designer stores, where I\
  \ was approached by one of the street vendors on the corner. He was a young man\
  \ with dark skin and big bright eyes, selling African bracelets and little carved\
  \ red wooden elephants, on an old tarp. \n\nI was more interested in his story than\
  \ what he was selling, so I asked his name and his story. With a smile, he began\
  \ telling me about his seeminly difficult life as a refugee from Senegal. Despite\
  \ his life being uneasy, he was content, and present, but I wondered what he wished\
  \ for now. \n\nI asked him, and his response was surprisingly comprehensive. \u201C\
  Now, I wish for more happy. But happy comes in different ways and changes every\
  \ second, so it is not possible to wish for just one thing that could make life\
  \ more happy. I wish for different happiness everyday\u201D.\n\nSince then, I\u2019\
  ve come to consider that perhaps the Trevi fountain isn\u2019t a cascade of drowning\
  \ wishes at all, but rather, a melting pot of hopes for the same common goal\u2026\
  \ Happiness. \n\nJust as a wandering Pilgrim wishes for happiness in the form of\
  \ redemption, and the asylum seeker wishes for happiness in the form of a home,\
  \ the pursuit of happiness is something we all share, and it unites us as humans.\n\
  \nI now sit here and ask myself \u2026 do we have the right to deny other fellow\
  \ humans their right to happiness? Perhaps the answer to this question will reveal\
  \ itself in my travels to come."
