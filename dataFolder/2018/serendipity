Text: "The year was 2016. The country was Brazil.\nAnd yes, this is a love story.\n\
  One of many that happens in Rio. Everyday.\nAugust 1st of 2016 was my day and this\
  \ is my story.\nIn May of 2016, I graduated as a Holistic Health Practitioner and\
  \ a Sports Massage Therapist in San Diego, California. This is where I live.\nThe\
  \ year before, even though I was still in school, I started the online application\
  \ to work as a Sports Massage Therapist for the Olympic Games in Rio, my hometown.\n\
  Once I had my certification, my suitcase packed and my ticket to Rio, I realized\
  \ I still didn\u2019t have the position I was applying for but it didn\u2019t matter.\
  \ I went anyways.\nI was chasing my dream.\nAfter a month of networking my way into\
  \ the Olympic Committee in Rio, I got the position.\nI got a contract to work as\
  \ a Sports Massage Therapist for the Track and Field Athletes with the Olympic Committee\
  \ in Brazil. \nThe weekend before the Games started, me and a friend had planned\
  \ a weekend getaway to Paraty, a colonial town off the coast of Rio. I was traveling\
  \ with my 10 year old son who was 8 at the time. We were coming from Rio. She was\
  \ coming from S\xE3o Paulo. The day before our departure, my son got sick and I\
  \ tried to talk her out of going but she talked me out of not going. That\u2019\
  s what friends are for. I got my son antibiotics and hopped on that bus the next\
  \ day. The first night we were there she went out and I stayed in the hotel with\
  \ my boy.\nThe second night she was too hangover to go anywhere and talked me into\
  \ going out just for a walk around town. Just because I had to it. I was laying\
  \ happily in a hammock pondering if I was going to get up or not.\nSuddenly, the\
  \ sky cleared and the moon showed up to me as saying, and I swear I heard that:\
  \ What if you are meant to meet someone important tonight?\nJust like that, I got\
  \ up and made my way out of the hotel. I started strolling along the colonial streets\
  \ of Paraty. Wondering around with no direction or a place to go. \nThe town was\
  \ buzzing and bubbling. \nAfter all, it was Rio. And it was the Olympics.\nThat\u2019\
  s  when I saw him. He was sitting in a bar, talking to those  two French girls.\n\
  I stopped immediately and started walking in his direction without even knowing\
  \ what I was doing. He stopped and looked at me.\nAnd I knew it. Right then. I was\
  \ in for the ride.\nIt\u2019s going to be two years in August and we have been seeing\
  \ each other since that day.\nIn different parts of the World. \nBrazil, Peru, California\
  \ and New Zeland next."
