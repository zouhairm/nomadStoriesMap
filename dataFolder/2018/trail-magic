Text: "It is day three of my Appalachian Trail thru-hike when I encounter my first\
  \ trail magic. I am hurrying down a hill toward Gooch Gap in a miserable drizzle,\
  \ dreaming of warm, dry living rooms and comfortable chairs when I see a tent next\
  \ to the trail. I think maybe I am imagining it. It is large and dry and filled\
  \ with hikers sitting in folding chairs eating freshly grilled sausage and cheese\
  \ sandwiches. As I approach, a woman runs outside. \u201CCome in, come in!\u201D\
  \ She calls. \u201CHot chocolate or coffee?\u201D She points to an empty chair.\
  \ \u201CSit!\u201D I do, and she hands me a steaming cup. \u201CRelax! I\u2019ll\
  \ bring you some food.\u201D\n\nI am terribly confused, but I take the hot chocolate.\
  \ A ginger-haired teenager offers me a warm baked apple. \u201CThanks,\u201D I say.\
  \ \u201CWhat is going on here? Why are you feeding us?\u201D\n\n\u201CBecause it\u2019\
  s fun!\u201D he says. \u201CMy family comes here every year during spring break\
  \ to help the hikers.\u201D\n\n\u201CYes, but\u2026 why?\u201D\n\n\u201CWe just\
  \ like to meet people. And cook. And hear stories. We camp for a week and hand out\
  \ food. Last night we made burritos for a group that was camping nearby. Tonight\
  \ we\u2019ll make stir-fry. If people walk through between meals, we give them fresh\
  \ fruit and granola bars.\u201D He points to two pick-up trucks piled high with\
  \ tarp-covered boxes.\n\n\u201CThat\u2019s all for hikers?\u201D I ask.\n\n\u201C\
  Well, that\u2019s not all of it,\u201D he says. \u201CWe have to go back into town\
  \ in the middle of the week for more food.\u201D\n\nI am astounded. There must be\
  \ hundreds of dollars of food in the trucks. \u201CWill you hike the trail some\
  \ day?\u201D I ask.\n\n\u201CNo,\u201D he tells me. \u201CI could never do it.\u201D\
  \ He smiles shyly. \u201CBut I sure admire all of you.\u201D\n \nHis father calls\
  \ from behind the grill and he runs off to distribute the next batch of apples,\
  \ leaving me shaking my head in wonder. I\u2019ve heard of kindness along the trail;\
  \ and someday I would love to spend an afternoon handing out Gatorades and listening\
  \ to stories. But an entire week of meals? I look out over the tent and see at least\
  \ twenty people packed in enjoying a warm breakfast.\n\nSomeone has found a guitar\
  \ and is strumming away in the corner of the tent; the people around him pull their\
  \ chairs up close and a few begin to sing. The boy reappears and offers me a bowl\
  \ of oatmeal. \n\nMonths later in a thru-hiking Q&A, someone will ask me what I\
  \ was most surprised by on the trail. Was it the weather? Wildlife? The rocks in\
  \ Pennsylvana? The snow in the Smokies? No, none of that. Throughout my thru-hike,\
  \ I was most surprised by the unassuming kindness of strangers."
