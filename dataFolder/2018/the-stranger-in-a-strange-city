Text: "I expected my trip to span three weeks from Poland to Greece. I didn\u2019\
  t expect my lease to have a typo no one caught, forcing me to completely gut my\
  \ trip so I could move a month early. Having my vacation pared down left me with\
  \ an evening in Warsaw. But how to maximize the time? After I checked into my hostel,\
  \ I messaged a guy on a gay hook-up app that I was in town. We had chatted before,\
  \ so he knew I was visiting. Why not spend a couple hours getting laid? He texted\
  \ back to say he would meet me there. I felt apprehensive though since sometimes\
  \ the guy on the other end didn\u2019t live up to his profile or photos. But when\
  \ he swung a leg over his bike and rested it against the fence, I was smitten. Big,\
  \ burly, bearded, he ticked all the boxes in the looks column. I knew to call him\
  \ Kris, that his full name might mangle a non-Polish mouth. The look in his eyes\
  \ told me I had also ticked the boxes for him. From the hostel he gathered me into\
  \ his personality and whisked me through his city. We started with squid ink spaghetti\
  \ at an outdoor cafe and then moved to beers with unpronounceable names at a side\
  \ street bar. Kris and I left little room for silence. We hopped from topic to topic\
  \ and back, innumerably completing each other\u2019s sentences. I let him put his\
  \ fingers around my mouth to help me get the shape of Polish words while I reminded\
  \ him of English phrases he had long forgotten. Yes, we felt a strong sexual pull,\
  \ but we felt something deeper that we both shied away from admitting. As the hours\
  \ slid into post-midnight quiet, we strolled back to the hostel, unknowingly holding\
  \ hands. We didn\u2019t want our time to end, so he suggested I stay with him. Disregarding\
  \ the dangers of a stranger in a strange city, I said yes. He walked his bike as\
  \ we didn\u2019t hurry to his place. Butterflies flurried within us, our hands touched\
  \ each other gently whenever they could, and still conversation flowed. He showed\
  \ me into his building and poured some wine and with a twinkle in his eye, he guided\
  \ me back out to the elevator. We ascended to the roof where a garden unrolled around\
  \ us. Over the fluttering plants along the ledge, the distant lights of Warsaw ignited\
  \ the pre-dawn sky. That was the first moment where I had nothing to say. Neither\
  \ did he. I finally admitted I hated having so little time with him, for I had fallen\
  \ for him. He was already nodding; he felt the same way. So we kissed and felt the\
  \ moment as deeply as we could for as long as we could."
