Text: "The motorbikes are tracing a thin line over the winding valleys of San Mariano,\
  \ a region forgotten by tourists up north in the Philippines. At these hours the\
  \ sun melts behind the golden clouds, swelling with the dusk. The hills award us\
  \ with a line of breathtaking glimmering rice fields that we just can't stop admiring,\
  \ stopping, taking out the camera and immortalizing such sights in a timeless frame.\n\
  \nSeo, however, seems kind of bored. After these four years of learning from modern\
  \ society thanks to Rov, his mentor, and having left the most absolute poverty for\
  \ a fairly better situation, he is worried that, after visiting his place, we might\
  \ end up regarding him as no more than just another native.\n\nThe trail continues\
  \ until we reach the village of our dear friend.  The low huts begin to emerge among\
  \ the sandy roads, sheltered by some banana trees that gently offer their shade.\
  \ The headlights of the motorcycles flashes on the surprised faces of the children\
  \ that begin to sprout through doors and windows. Soon they guide us through narrow\
  \ streets, crowding together as they laugh and wave at us. I feel too overwhelmed.\
  \  \n\nWe walk to Seo\u2019s house, a small wooden hut. The entrance is both the\
  \ kitchen and the living room, submerged in a grayish smoke that emerges from the\
  \ fire of the pan. Seo tells me that he will buy the house of his grandfather to\
  \ build a nice two-storey house and claims that he will bring items from the city\
  \ to help his family.\n\nThe fact that this boy regards his village customs as old\
  \ and outdated while taking pride in the things he now has in the city is something\
  \ that I can't stop feeling partly annoyed about.\n\nAfter a while, Rov takes me\
  \ aside for a talk. We look at the night sky where an unknown firmament blazes,\
  \ made out of a thousand stars swirling like a milky whirlwind.\n\nHe tells me that,\
  \ sometimes, the torrential rains caused floods in the village. Seo\u2019s cousin\
  \ died in the last one. He also tells me that, in the big cities, we don't understand\
  \ the struggle of this people to survive. Turns out that Seo doesn't feel embarrassed,\
  \ but impotent. He wants his family to suffer less. \n\nI have the privilege to\
  \ come from where I come from. I have \"suffered\" for love, for my studies, for\
  \ family matters... but not for just remaining alive. If I had been living twenty\
  \ years this way, I would have likely taken the slightest opportunity to abandon\
  \ the struggle. And, like Seo, I would just wish I could look back to help those\
  \ who stayed."
