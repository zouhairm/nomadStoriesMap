Text: "It was almost 3 years now; I have not been for any extensive rides. My book\
  \ Exploring \u201CThe Himalayas\u201D, The Land of High Passes, Ladakh is my pride\
  \ and wrote for myself. This time I thought to do something very different and to\
  \ the extreme, which shall be the next sequel of my book. I wanted to complete the\
  \ Seven Sister States of North East India which are less travelled and are not touristy.\
  \ \nI set off on the road from Guwahati without any plan and itinerary on my Royal\
  \ Enfield with my camera hung on my neck. My first target was Arunachal Pradesh\
  \ because of the Mighty Virgin Himalayas. I went to the most distant places in Arunachal.\
  \ I rode in the rains, bumpy roads, never ending slush, over the sands and rocks\
  \ of river beds and sometimes no roads. \nI took the adventure ferry rides and went\
  \ through the tribal villages. I even took the famous hanging bridge which swings\
  \ and is made up of bamboo.  I even met elephant herd at Nameri National Park and\
  \ crossed several national parks all alone. I almost took 42 days to complete this\
  \ circuit.\nThen through the roads of Assam and camping at Majuli (world's biggest\
  \ river island) I entered Nagaland, Manipur and finally I rode into Burma. In Burma,\
  \ I got few hours to spend at Tamu after persuading a lot to both the countries\
  \ immigration center. I also trekked to Dzukou Valley all alone through the jungle\
  \ from Jakhama end and camped under the stars while the temperature dropped to sub\
  \ zero degree.\nThen I went to Aizawl in Mizoram and by now my motorcycle was giving\
  \ up. Changed the piston ring and went down to the extreme south to the Blue Mountains\
  \ and while coming back met the Biggest Family. Riding through the rain and slippery\
  \ roads my bike was half hanging from the cliff and the truck drivers pulled me\
  \ out. But nothing could stop me going ahead. After almost spending 10 days in Mizoram\
  \ I headed for Tripura, Meghalaya and returned back to Guwahati completing almost\
  \ 11000 km. In Meghalaya I trekked to the Double Decker Living Root Bridge and then\
  \ towards the Rainbow falls which was heavenly beautiful and known to very few tourists.\
  \ Then finally I headed home riding to Jharkhand through West Bengal and Bihar completing\
  \ 12000+ km in 85 days on my motorcycle. \nI stayed everywhere right from the hotel,\
  \ backyard of a house, kitchen of a Dhaba, dorms of youth hostels, camping in monasteries,\
  \ police stations and in petrol pumps. \nThis ride shall always be remembered throughout\
  \ my life."
