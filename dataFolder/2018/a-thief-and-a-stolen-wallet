Text: "I found the island by accident. I missed a bus out of Copan after trying to\
  \ recover a stolen wallet. By the time I arrived in La Ceiba I also lost my spot\
  \ on a research vessel headed to La Mosquitia. With over a week to kill and the\
  \ savory scent of the Caribbean in my nostrils I became restless to find a new adventure.\
  \ \n\nAs I sat on the rooftop bar of my hotel that night, I watched lightning illuminate\
  \ the outline of an island in the distance. Enticed by the thought of spending a\
  \ relaxing week on the island, I inquired of the bartender. She told me it was a\
  \ place for tourists and if I could handle the ride aboard the \u201Cvomit comet\u201D\
  \ I would enjoy my time. I laughed and informed her, \u201CI don\u2019t get seasick\
  \ easily.\u201D\n\n\u201CThat\u2019s what they all say, \u201Cshe replied with a\
  \ smile. \n\nThe next morning I caught the ferry along with dozens of other backpackers.\
  \ Those who had never been there before were, like me, perched next to windows or\
  \ on the deck eager to welcome the fabled island into view. Some, as promised, were\
  \ relinquishing their rum from the night before. \n\nUpon arriving we were greeted\
  \ by a throng of people selling scuba dive lessons and a place to stay. I had no\
  \ intention of learning to dive. It was an anxious time in my life and the last\
  \ thing I could imagine enjoying was confining myself underwater. I saw myself relaxing\
  \ on the beach with a half-empty bottle of rum and a coconut.\n\nBut this was not\
  \ that kind of island. It was a diver\u2019s paradise. By noon I was an hour into\
  \ my first dive class. The next morning I waded into the Caribbean and knelt beneath\
  \ its calm, sparkling surface. My eyes were wide in panic as I held my breath and\
  \ searched for my instructor amidst the sand-stormy water. He rolled his hand in\
  \ front of his mouth, signaling me to take a breath and, to my surprise, I was still\
  \ alive at the end of the breath.\n\nImmediately, I was hooked. I canceled my return\
  \ flight and spent the rest of the summer perfecting the art of diving. I left only\
  \ because I had neglected pretty much everything back home and school was about\
  \ to start for me again.\n\nI would return to the island six other times, only taking\
  \ a few years off during seasons of political unrest. Each time I returned I made\
  \ more friends among the locals. Over the years, I shared many Christmas mornings\
  \ with them, was baptized by one of their pastors and married the love of my life\
  \ in their presence. I cannot imagine my life any other way now and I owe it all\
  \ to a thief and a stolen wallet."
