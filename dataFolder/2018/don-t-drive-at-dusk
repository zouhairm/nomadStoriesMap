Text: "\u201CBring more water than you think you need,\u201D said Henry. \u201CTake\
  \ extra fuel, and enough food that you\u2019d be OK for a couple days. Maybe get\
  \ a satellite phone. There\u2019s no signal on the Nullarbor.\u201D\nWe sat drinking\
  \ wine from chipped mugs in our friends\u2019 Adelaide house, finalising plans for\
  \ our road trip to Perth. We\u2019d begun in Melbourne, battled hordes of selfie\
  \ sticks along the Great Ocean Road, slept freezing nights in the Grampians National\
  \ Park. The next stage beckoned.\nThe Nullarbor is spoken of in hushed tones by\
  \ Australians. Mention an intention to cross it and eyebrows raise, concern flits\
  \ across faces, glances are exchanged.\nThe name \u2018Nullarbor\u2019 means \u2018\
  no tree\u2019, an intimidating appellation fitting for a 200,000km\xB2 stretch of\
  \ bare desert scrubland. No water, no gas, no signal, very few road users.\nWe couldn\u2019\
  t wait.\nThe next morning, we jammed our last belongings into the boot, and were\
  \ waved off with some last rushed words of advice: don\u2019t drive at dusk. \n\
  Dusk is when kangaroos play.\nDriving across Australia is truly a demonstration\
  \ of distance. Vast expanses of space consume the miles between cities. Our trusty\
  \ Kia did its best to compete with the immense emptiness, through dust and hills,\
  \ hardly protesting at ill-advised attempts to take on 4WD tracks.\nThen we reached\
  \ the edge of the Nullarbor. All the boxes were checked: extra fuel, more food than\
  \ an overstocked pre-Christmas larder, water for days. We arrived in the morning,\
  \ too: no danger of dusk. No kangaroo threat. A sign announced our arrival: the\
  \ eastern end of the Treeless Plain.\nWe exchanged a look, and drove on. Outside,\
  \ the foliage withdrew and monotonised, mile upon mile of shrunken shrubs populating\
  \ the coarse ground. Occasionally a back-broken tree would surface, prompting bad\
  \ jokes about the unsuitability of the desert\u2019s \u2018no tree\u2019 title.\n\
  But a mere three hours on, eyes aching from repeating scenery, we were done. Not\
  \ a kangaroo in sight, bar corpses lining the road edges.\nWe had survived.\nTwo\
  \ weeks on, 1000 miles down the coast, we started the journey between Esperance\
  \ and Albany early, wanting to save by free camping out of town. It was 5.30pm:\
  \ the hazy time between day and night.\nA blur of brownish fur leapt from the roadside,\
  \ silhouetted in full-beam headlights. The impact was decisive. One headlight smashed,\
  \ the bonnet buckled; brakes were slammed and we came to a breathless halt on the\
  \ hard shoulder.\nWe exchanged a look; each knew what the other was thinking.\n\
  Don\u2019t drive at dusk."
