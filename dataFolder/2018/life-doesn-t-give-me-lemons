Text: "A Whole New World, a soundtrack of Aladdin, was the first song that I completely\
  \ sang out loud when I was kid. The movie made me wonder how would it feel to be\
  \ easily go to places you have never been before. However, life gives me chance.\n\
  \nActually, my trip to Saudi Arabia was purposely aimed at spiritual journey. I\
  \ was arrived in Jeddah for the first time. It felt hot but cold at the same time.\
  \ There were some murals in some buildings, mostly was Arabic writings.  Something\
  \ that took my vision the type of unique clothes, Niqab or Burka. The other thing\
  \ was the desert, which was new for me as I live in a tropical country. It is also\
  \ surrounded by a lot of mountains which was full of rocks, dusts and gravel rather\
  \ than soil like in other places. I had the opportunity to hike Jabal Nur (re: Mountain\
  \ of Light). Because of those compositions, the hiking was harder and possibly let\
  \ you fall down after half of climbing. But when you arrive above, the scenery is\
  \ priceless. Moreover when you hike at night, all you can see from above is the\
  \ lights around the city. That probably why it called as the mountain of light.\n\
  \nOne day, it was time for us to move from Medina to Mecca. Along the road was hills\
  \ of mounds of rock. The hot weather was very stinging. So in keeping me sane, I\
  \ decided to play The Beatles. All of sudden, someone behind me poke me and said,\
  \ \"Get ready, we're going to have fun with the locals.\" Then when our bus stopped,\
  \ we jumped out of bus, across the street, there was a bunch of camels! It was amazing\
  \ to see dozens of them drinking tons of water. Made me thirsty too. \n\nI was eating\
  \ an ice cream when I realized that there was one outstanding being there. It was\
  \ standing upright, sturdy but still showing its beauty despite being hit by the\
  \ heat from the sun and the soil. It was beautiful cactus. Like all around was look\
  \ brown, even the camels have the same color as the land. But in the middle of that,\
  \ It survived. \n\n\"Beautiful, isn't it?\" Said the ice cream seller. I nodded\
  \ my head.\n\"To be like that, you only need to believe that you are with God. By\
  \ that, you can do everything. Stand up with dignity, even though you are all alone.\
  \ By that kind of faith, you will be brave to hit all the obstacles and keep showing\
  \ your beautiful side. That's the last thing you have, a courage.\" He continued\
  \ and smiled at me.\n\nSomehow, God and Universe just conspire to let me know that\
  \ sometimes life possibly gives you magical thing by trading it with bravery."
