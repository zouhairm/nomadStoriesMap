Text: "We'd been planning a trip to some of the Balkan countries. What we didn\u2019\
  t know is that a few of these countries were so much more underdeveloped than we\
  \ could've ever imagined. And by some, I specifically mean Albany, the country where\
  \ my story took place.The thing is that one of my friends back then, Mr. French,\
  \ kind of looked like Pablo Escobar, specially when you looked at his id. You should\
  \ also know that we were about to cross Albany's border, and they have this unusual,\
  \ yet not surprising, tendency of smuggling hardcore drugs through the borderlines.\
  \ So we were all a bit worried about the situation. After all, we were the perfect\
  \ cover-up for an Albanian Cartel\u2019s (if that\u2019s a thing) operation. We\
  \ had everything against us. We were eight people, apparently too many for a friendly\
  \ trip; we were driving rented cars, which is the modus operandi of this kind of\
  \ enterprises; we were all Erasmus students, what turns out to be the perfect disguise;\
  \ and we had Mr. French with us, my Pablo Escobar lookalike friend. Obviously everything\
  \ went sideways once they took a look at my friend's id. The officer indicated us\
  \ to drive the cars to an old and muddy garage located right next to the borderline,\
  \ although not close enough to make a run for it. We were told to get out of the\
  \ car and two two officers explained us, in whatever language they spoke (as that\
  \ was neither English nor anything I had ever heard before), that we were about\
  \ to be searched for drugs. We were just a group of students travelling and they\
  \ were mistaking us with drug dealers. For a second there, we all looked at each\
  \ other hoping to find an answer to the question \u201CWhat the fuck is happening?\u201D\
  .  After searching for drugs on us and not finding anything they thought that we\
  \ were hiding the drugs in the cars. Consequently, they brought out hammers and\
  \ other tools, as if they were preparing for a beat down. Fortunately, those were\
  \ not meant for us, but for the cars. It then began what has to be the most in depth\
  \ and savage search that I have ever seen in my life. They teared up every single\
  \ piece of the cars they could. Thank god, the tools were not suitable for such\
  \ work and they had to stop at some point, as they didn\u2019t succeed in finding\
  \ any illegal elements within the car. Surprisingly, they did manage to pull back\
  \ together all the pieces of the cars. Finally, they allowed us to leave, even though\
  \ it was with a hint of distrust. It was something that I will always remember."
