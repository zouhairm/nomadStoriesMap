Text: "\u201CKalimera, (good morning)\u201D shouts a short, muscular man with white-blonde\
  \ hair and a beard to match. His name is Marcos, a beekeeper, and his personality\
  \ feels as tremendous as Crete itself, the largest island here in Greece as he carries\
  \ on with boisterous greetings, embracing everyone with warm hugs. As part of my\
  \ work with FoodTalksDC, I\u2019m intentionally traveling here for a farm-to-table\
  \ heritage journey. I\u2019ve only been here for two days, yet there is something\
  \ I feel softly pulling me closer in. It could also be that my name in Greek means\
  \ \u201Choneybee\u201D so I instantly feel a  magnetic connection. \n \nWe are here\
  \ to spend the day with Marcos at his farm learning about beekeeping and honey production.\
  \ It is hot, rigid and dry; meanwhile, perspiration is starting to formulate at\
  \ the cracks of my underarm and the nape of my neck. But the stillness of the land\
  \ and the easiness of Marcos shepherd in a coolness that I imbibe as I slip on a\
  \ bulky bee outfit. \n \nAt the top of the hill, we crowd around Marcos. Bees land\
  \ on his broad shoulders, no uniform on, but he is gentle as he holds up a comb\
  \ swarming with bees. We walk towards him with curiosity, doused with a bit of fear\
  \ that the bees may sting, but his presence is calm in nature. A few bees buzz around\
  \ me, but I choose to emulate the calming stance as Marcos. The bees don\u2019t\
  \ sting.\n \nWe are driven to Marcos\u2019 home, more bees swarm against color-block\
  \ hives adjacent to his production space where we\u2019d sink our teeth into sweet,\
  \ waxy honeycombs. Funny enough, I feel comfortable staging a photo near his hives.\
  \ \n \nUnder a green olive tree, we gather for a beautiful lunch, overlooking the\
  \ picturesque Cretan mountains. \u201CYamas (cheers),\u201D as we lift our glasses\
  \ of raki for a toast. Marcos sings a harmonious poem as a thank you to us. He then\
  \ pulls out a portrait of him and his wife; she is sick with cancer. Marcos had\
  \ taken her to the hospital that same morning, but we never experienced a sorrowful\
  \ moment with him. The pain of not having his beloved, bedridden wife by his side\
  \ may have stung him with grief, but he innately showed us love that was sweeter\
  \ than honey. \n\nMonths have passed and I\u2019m back in D.C., still able to pull\
  \ Mediterranean richness from that iconic day. But people like Marcos -- who embody\
  \ a transcendental relationship with their motherland -- bear a mystic wonder about\
  \ them that can\u2019t be so easily transported. I muse about this as I douse a\
  \ fresh bee sting with an ice pack."
