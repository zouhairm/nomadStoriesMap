Text: "It was August and monsoon was on its peak in Central India. When everyone around\
  \ me was avoiding to get out on the roads, I was visiting one village after the\
  \ other in Harda, Madhya Pradesh. Not getting a seat in the public bus had become\
  \ one of those problems that didn\u2019t bother me anymore. Now, the major concern\
  \ starts after getting down on the bus stop, to cross puddles of mud and dodging\
  \ cow dung.\nI was working with women groups to educate them about financial literacy\
  \ as a tool for empowerment. Self doubt was on an all time high because even after\
  \ crossing so many hurdles to reach where I was; the women were least interested\
  \ in listening to me. The bus would break down or I would fall down in the slippery\
  \ streets but their reaction wouldn't change. This went on for five weeks.  I would\
  \ somehow reach their doorsteps, drenched in mud and dirt but they would be too\
  \ busy to come together for a meeting, leave alone save money collectively.\nOn\
  \ one such day, I was waiting for women in the hall of a school, which is also used\
  \ as a common place for gatherings. It was lunch time and I could hear my stomach\
  \ growling. As always, Kavita, who works there, offered me a cup of tea. Out of\
  \ habit, I was about to reject, because in last 28 years of existence, I had never\
  \ liked milk tea, anywhere. Unsure if it was hunger or the reluctance to reject\
  \ it one more time, I picked a cup. The smile on Kavita\u2019s face turned into\
  \ a grin and she ran inside to tell other women about my sudden acceptance after\
  \ so long. \u201CWhat\u2019s the big deal\u201D, I heard me asking myself.\nLater\
  \ that afternoon, when I was half-asleep on the floor, women started dropping in\
  \ one after the other. That day, we ended up talking for an hour, about the need\
  \ for a collective to come out of poverty, for savings and inter-loaning. I heard\
  \ stories of their families, festivals, food, and told them about mine. Something\
  \ was drastically different about the energy in the room. They were more open, patient\
  \ and understanding. Wrapping up, as I stepped out to leave, one of them said, \u201C\
  Fir aana didi\u201D. (Come again, sister)\nOn my way back, struggling for a seat\
  \ in the bus, as I looked out to Soybean fields, it struck me. The magic a cup of\
  \ tea had done. It changed from me being referred to as a madam, and rather, someone\
  \ closer, a didi. Next day onwards, I couldn\u2019t say \u2018No\u2019 to the tea\
  \ cup as a simple \u2018Yes\u2019 helped me bond stronger with the community and\
  \ work with them for their empowerment. We all would call each other Didi."
