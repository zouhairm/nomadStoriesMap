Text: "The warm voice of an old guitar mingling with the deep baritone of a Balinese\
  \ bongo suddenly made scribbling my own lyrics less enticing. I stepped into the\
  \ dusk as the silhouette of Mount Agung swallowed the sun and belched lava coloured\
  \ clouds. The culprits behind the tune barely understood English but we all spoke\
  \ music.\n\nThere you were: tousled hair, dark skin, brown eyes and a voice like\
  \ crisp winter air in the melting tropics. You nonchalantly beat the drum as your\
  \ toes tapped the rhythm on the shimmering black sand. A clove cigarette dangled\
  \ between your teeth, its tendrils beckoning me forward. You taught me\_Rasa Ini.\
  \ I taught you\_La Bamba. At dawn, your half smile swept me onto the back of your\
  \ scooter and into summer. We sang at every restaurant in Amed, spinning the threads\
  \ of our music into rupees.\n\nEvery afternoon, I\u2019d amble down the dusty main\
  \ road and spot you playing on a broken chessboard or sparking up a new beat. Meanwhile,\
  \ your mother would pulverise peanuts mercilessly for gado-gado sauce and your cousin,\
  \ indefatigable charmer of disoriented tourists, would try to slide under the skirt\
  \ of some fair-haired backpacker who was in Bali searching for her true self. The\
  \ first few days I expected you to slap me back to reality by trying to sell me\
  \ some jewelry or wood carving. You never did.\n\nEffortlessly, you managed to checkmate,\
  \ shoot me a wink and mark your territory by greeting me as your sweetheart.\n\n\
  \u201CSayang! I pish mack\u2019rel por you today!\u201D I still chuckle at the interchangeability\
  \ of p\u2019s and f\u2019s that your broken English inherited from Indonesian.\n\
  \nI was terrified that your memory would fade if my camera didn\u2019t capture the\
  \ reality. You were an aspiring artist who dreamed of a new guitar. Occasional tips\
  \ and making beds had allowed you to save up some rupees. Unfortunately, your father\
  \ sacrificed your little brother\u2019s rooster at a cockfight and all your savings\
  \ went to buying him a new one. The blue and yellow chequered shirt divulged your\
  \ morning activities, although on special days you\u2019d skip school to throw parties\
  \ in the jungle and dance barefoot around a wild pig until the sky overflowed with\
  \ stars.\n\nYears on, I wonder why you secretly stole your cousin\u2019s phone to\
  \ call me every night for a year. As I dive into photographs, I surrender to the\
  \ realisation that it was my eye\u2019s lens, not the camera\u2019s, that distorted\
  \ the truth. It was easy to ignore that you were an impoverished fisherman\u2019\
  s son and I was your escape to a brighter future."
