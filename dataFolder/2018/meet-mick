Text: "\"Well I guess I'll just set up my hammock on the beach.\"\n\"Nonsense, as\
  \ long as you don't rape me or kill the Mrs. you can stay with us,\" an English\
  \ accent proclaimed.  The accent was Mick's and these were his words 90 minutes\
  \ after betting me he could guess my age by feeling my beard.  He was a mid 30's\
  \ British defector that discovered he preferred the south east Asia life.  Originally\
  \ landing in Papua New Guinea to later be deported he had found a home in Ao Nang,\
  \ Thailand.  He was the ultimate dream chaser, played guitar like Page and drank\
  \ Leo cause Chang was \"ladyboy piss.\"  Mick is a warrior for living in the now,\
  \ a dive master currently managing a shop by day and living by night.\nI met him\
  \ after a 14 hours of bus ride had landed me in a beach side bar sipping on a Chang-\
  \ the last one I would drink.  A small tiki style bar with 2 tables and a girl from\
  \ Laos tending bar.  A boisterous yet fun voice boomed into the open air space of\
  \ the bar. \n \"Anyone got some green?,\" he questioned.  Intrigued with this man\
  \ I quickly reached into my pack of smokes and presented 3/4 of a joint which I\
  \ now realize I risked my freedom if not life in possessing.  He thanked me and\
  \ sparked it up.  Then came the beard bet, that cost him a shot of booze.  He was\
  \ off by 2 years.  We talked and drank for another hour or so and then the far past\
  \ annoyed barmaid pushed us out.  We stopped at another bar had a beer, met some\
  \ people and talked some more.  He had a strict upbringing in England and escaped\
  \ it for a life of rock n' roll.  His Mrs. was a beautiful Thai woman that was deaf,\
  \ an important part in them staying together.  She is an amazing chef and was Mick's\
  \ chauffeur for he had no care to learn how to ride the scooter she did.\nSo that\
  \ night after it was agreed that no felony was going to be committed; the 3 of us\
  \ hoped on the scooter and I drove us home.  There Mick entertained with stories\
  \ of his extraordinary life.\nFor the next 3 nights Mick was my personal tour guide.\
  \  He welcomed me rent free.  The most magical of nights was spent at another local\
  \ bar where a Thai cover band played alt rock from the 90's.  We enjoyed ourselves\
  \ into the night.  Later on my trip I was welcomed back into his home while waiting\
  \ for a flight to BKK.  Mick was born with the spirit that few desire and even fewer\
  \ possess.  Having great trials that could bury some men Mick enjoys life; only\
  \ his humility is greater than his kindness.  From him I have Mick\u2019s Law, \u201C\
  whatever can go right, will.\u201D"
