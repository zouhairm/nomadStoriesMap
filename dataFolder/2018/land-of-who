Text: "With the guts full of cookies and chips and the skin burned by the somniferous\
  \ tropical sun that fell by prow, we made out the sand we left behind 8 years ago.\n\
  Everything had changed. The barely 11 kilometers that cross from end to end \u201C\
  the turtle island\"; name supported by different theories that go from its presumed\
  \ geographic similarity with the profile of the reptile, until the great abundance\
  \ of these in its waters, had stopped being the virgin and costumbrist paradise\
  \ that we met in order to satisfy the extravagances of our modern times.\n\nToday\
  \ even the most ramshackle restaurant of the area has wifi. Bunches of supermarkets,\
  \ gas stations, resorts, shops and clubs fill the roads where the jungle hardly\
  \ let see halo of civilization.\nThe undeniable trigger was the wealth of its waters,\
  \ which, governed by the great whale shark, attracted divers from all over the world,\
  \ spread among the more than 80 schools saut\xE9ed between Thai land and sea.\n\n\
  Despite the imposition of the West, the natives haven\u2019t lost their characteristic\
  \ hospitality and cheery face that seems to completely ignore the strange and absurd\
  \ ambitions of the white man.\n\nHowever, even in heaven there is an abyss. A curiosity\
  \ is that this tiny piece of earth used to be a prison for politicians at the beginning\
  \ of the last century, a time when its coast was full of sharks. \u201CThis would\
  \ be hell if it wasn\u2019t for the sunsets\u201D -in words of the prisoners-. \n\
  \nUpon disembarking, we met an old friend who brought us up to date on the social\
  \ scene.\nHe told us about \u201CThe Island of Death\u201D as everybody knew it\
  \ since a woman\u2019s body; half eaten by lizards, appeared in a burned bungalow\
  \ a couple of months ago, just as the ones of other six tourists dead mysteriously\
  \ in the last years.\n\nThat night while we were sleeping thick smoke coming out\
  \ from the balcony woke us up. Our deck chairs were scorched.\nWe still don\u2019\
  t know the origin of the fire nor the nature of the mafias hidden in the heart of\
  \ Koh Tao which acts can only be explained by fear. The response to the unknown\
  \ with a mad counter- attack to protect the border; that double-edged sword that\
  \ drives mankind into the fanaticism to guard their identity.\nAs the turtle that\
  \ to continue wandering the oceans has to deny the colors of the reef."
