Text: "\u201CPull over, that\u2019s Carmen!\u201D I shouted to my brother, who was\
  \ busy attempting to navigate endless potholes in our stiff rental car. He pulled\
  \ up beside the tiny old woman hobbling along in the grass beside the road. \n\n\
  \u201CHola Carmen,\u201D my brother called out of the window, \u201Cte llevo?\u201D\
  \ She remembered us instantly from our conversation the previous day, and nodded\
  \ brightly at the offer of a ride, clambering into the backseat. \n\nWe were driving\
  \ through small villages outside of Zihuatanejo, Mexico, hoping to find a surf spot.\
  \ Several days ago, we had driven down this same road and spotted a giant green\
  \ iguana stamping languidly down the road, but today we were just as surprised to\
  \ find the cleaning lady from our hostel walking the same way. She and I chatted\
  \ in Spanish as I asked her where she lived and what she had been out doing that\
  \ day. She told us she had been to el mercado to buy some groceries. \n\nMy brother\
  \ and I had navigated the open-air Zihua market several days before. As Carmen rambled\
  \ on about the produce she had bought, I recalled the bustle of people weaving in\
  \ and out of the crowded stalls. The heat had baked the streets and mixed with the\
  \ dust, leaving the air heavy with the richly sweet smells of fruit, meat, vegetables,\
  \ and cheese. We had rounded each corner to a new heady palette of scents and vibrant\
  \ mountains of wares piled to impossible pinnacles. \n\nCarmen began directing us\
  \ down more rugged dirt roads, past lush fields where small dwellings peppered the\
  \ landscape. When we reached her home - a wooden shack surrounded by tall coconut\
  \ palms - her grandchildren began emerging from the house. She motioned for us to\
  \ follow her inside and out the back door. Before we could say anything, the five-foot-tall\
  \ abuelita wrenched a machete from where it was stuck in a nearby stump, and began\
  \ shimmying up one of the coconut palms. My brother and I watched, mouths agape,\
  \ as she brutally hacked down two giant green coconuts, and made her way back down.\
  \ She then proceeded to methodically chop them up until they were perfect cups of\
  \ fresh coconut water, which she enthusiastically pushed into our hands. \n\nWe\
  \ all sat together in the shade of the trees, spooning out juicy coconut meat for\
  \ the kids, and wondering at the smallness of the world. We didn't know it then,\
  \ but my brother and I would return to Mexico the following year and drive Carmen\
  \ home every day from her job at our hostel, and we would enjoy many more green\
  \ coconuts under the same brilliant sun."
