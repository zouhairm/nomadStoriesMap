Text: "I had the bad luck to break my arm in Siberia.\n\nPeople at the hostel told\
  \ me that I could get a seat in the bus going to the big city and go to hospital\
  \ there.\n\nFirst hospital was closed. After trying some hospitals, asking for russian\
  \ card which I did not have, I went to the \xAB cheap \xBB hospital, the one which\
  \ accepts anybody without money. At the entrance, I showed my french passport. At\
  \ each further gate, I showed the passport. I reached the registration place : a\
  \ doctor took my passport and told me to go in the waiting room.\n\nThe waiting\
  \ room is one room full of beds.\nThere was a man bleeding on his chest. Another\
  \ man was crying, his skin was grey. I understood I had to undress. I was so shocked\
  \ by that I did not react.\n\nWhen the doctor came back, I was still seating there,\
  \ starring at these 2 sharing the room with me, and thinking that it could be much\
  \ more : the room was for 10 people !\n\nThe doctors managed to pull out my sweatshirt\
  \ and look at my arm. They said to wait and left.\n\nI was still not so sure what\
  \ I was doing there, so much pain, so much morphin throughout the day.\n\nThe grey\
  \ man questioned me. As I did not speak russian, I said I am French. He questioned\
  \ further. I showed my arm. I questioned him. He showed his head. I questioned the\
  \ bleeding one. He showed his bleeding chest.\n\nDoctors came back. Big silence\
  \ in the room.\n\nThey looked at my arm, fixed a harness, and told me to wait and\
  \ left.\n\nThe grey man questioned again. I explained that I went to the baikal\
  \ lake. He asked about the lake. I told the lake is wonderful, with so much ice\
  \ and snow, and so nice blue sky. All was so nice, then I felt on the ice.\nBoth\
  \ cried.\n\nThe grey man questioned again. I was not so sure what else I can tell.\
  \ So I started to tell the same. They seemed to enjoy the part with snow and the\
  \ blue sky. They both cried again when I said how I felt. I understood\u2026\n\n\
  I told them about the wonderful snow, the wonderful ice, the wonderful lake, the\
  \ nice weather, and all was so nice\u2026\n\nSuddenly the doctors entered. It was\
  \ the middle of my speach.\n\nThe doctors starred at us, not understanding why a\
  \ foreigner cares of well-being of the bleeding alcoolic and the crazy old man.\n\
  \nWhen I think about my trip to Russia and about this hospital, I remember these\
  \ 2 persons, in the waiting room. On that day, they were the only ones who really\
  \ listened to me. On that day, there were the only ones who still could enjoy the\
  \ magnificience of the nature and the world as it is."
