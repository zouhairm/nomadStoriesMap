Text: "Alongside a deserted highway. In the northern pine forests of Arizona. A small\
  \ trail off the side of the road appears and vanishes you into a unique leisure\
  \ spot built by mother nature. We stepped out of the car together. Our hands were\
  \ full as we walked into the state park. A strange phenomenon of fun. Known popularly\
  \ as Slide Rock.\nThe sounds of children and adults swimming and talking filled\
  \ the air. The sweat glistened on my forehead as I set down our cooler. Awe draws\
  \ my breath in. A small outcropping of giant flat boulders along Oak Creek. The\
  \ earth pulling the clear water falling and flowing down the mountain. My bare feet\
  \ pressing against the soft and smooth stones.  The wind floated away in bursts.\
  \ Smelling fresh pine as I closed my eyes. \nMe and my sister raced up the creek.\
  \ Following her often got me in trouble, but she always seemed to be the one taking\
  \ the lead. We stopped were the rock face ascended suddenly and trees grew over\
  \ it. The first slide was here. My sister gasped in surprise and giggled as she\
  \ dipped her toe in. Her Christmas cherry laugh rang in the air as she splashed\
  \ me tormentingly.\nWe started on our marks, get set, go. Pushing and then jumping\
  \ forward ahead of each other, like we were playing leap frog. Running our knees\
  \ deep, kicking up water in great waves as we splashed bystanders mercilessly. Gliding\
  \ through grooves in the rock and flying out as the current soared us forward. I\
  \ knocked my knee against the stone, blood leaking out and trapped under my skin.\
  \ I stubbed my toe in the sand, flesh ripping off. There are always casualties of\
  \ war I thought to myself. \nI found her near the edge of a huge lake further down\
  \ the creek. A murky and black body of water that had two rival cliffs. One cliff\
  \ jump was on a giant boulder at the edge of the lake. The other cliff stood on\
  \ a steep inclining hill across from it. People were lined up on the rocks waiting\
  \ for their chance. I looked with mortal end at the height of both jumps. That\u2019\
  s crazy I pleaded as my sister rushed up the hill. I followed her in disbelief.\
  \ People at the top were crowded at the edge of the cliff petrified. My heart beat\
  \ stopped as I watched my sister without hesitation leap into the air. Her body\
  \ flying for a moment. I peered over the edge. Her head quickly popped up and out\
  \ of the water. She yelled to me encouragingly. I can\u2019t I thought fearfully.\
  \ Then without overthinking I jumped and thought I can."
