Text: "I know that we both are looking. I don\u2019t know how to describe it: dynamics\
  \ or dispersal? Apparently, it depends from the mood. The real panacea is the journey.\n\
  \nThis is how I ended up in Malta for a month. I traded Lithuanian snow for a sea\
  \ prison. The island has an interesting phenomenon: it is both a symbol of freedom\
  \ and ferity, as well as a very clear coastline, that separates your own limits\
  \ from water\u2019s immensity. And there are so many cars around \u2013 where are\
  \ they all going? It\u2019s almost as if they are taking part in a competition:\
  \ from one coast of the island to another. And back. Observations. I'm going to\
  \ follow the grandmother.\n\nThe grandmother goes to church. Oddly, the houses that\
  \ are painted in a light cappuccino colour all look the same, as if they were afraid\
  \ to draw attention to themselves. And here is the church, allowing everyone around\
  \ to realize its power. \n\nThe grandmother is calm and knows what to do. Oh, the\
  \ wonderful Maltese tranquillity! Rubies on her hands and a white collar of a velvet\
  \ dress. Little life celebrations. She should have at least five children. Apparently,\
  \ she wakes up at 5 am in the morning like everyone else here, then cleans and scrubs\
  \ her entire home. The local \u201Ctradition\u201D \u2013 chemicals interfere with\
  \ breakfast smells, usually, pastries. There are clippings on the refrigerator.\
  \ And now \u2013 a scrapbook in her fancy bag: a shopping list and some photographs\
  \ with the grandkids. What an obvious journey \u2013 to the church. \n\nI left the\
  \ grandmother, I feel hungry. I know how to enjoy the perfect tomatoes. It's a very\
  \ fun tradition to have tablecloths. In Lithuania we are becoming too Scandinavian.\
  \ That\u2019s it, I finally chose a glass of wine and I need to focus on why I am\
  \ here. So, the meaning of life. I envy the people walking along the coast as if\
  \ they don\u2019t need anything else. \n\nWhen I was in Valletta\u2019s (the capital)\
  \ library yesterday, it seemed to me that an answer could be found among those small\
  \ card drawers. It is unbelievable that an island on the edge of Europe has one\
  \ of the oldest continental libraries! It seems to me that I'm focusing my attention\
  \ to the wrong things. \n\n\"It\u2019s a beautiful piece of music, miss, isn\u2019\
  t it?\", says a man sitting near. Indeed, the classics always pleasantly hypnotize.\
  \ I smiled at him. I am listening. Maybe the answer of a journey is to stop looking?\
  \ To enjoy the process \u2013 dynamic or static. After all, nobody listens to music\
  \ just to hear how it ends.\nYes."
