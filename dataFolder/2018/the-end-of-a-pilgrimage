Text: "This cathedral. It was\_there\_in\_front of me.\nAfter more than 700 km and\
  \ 2 months\_of\_walking I had reached it! Surrounded by the seasons, I learnt to\_\
  looking into \_myself again, helped by the interactions with\_other\_pilgrims walking\
  \ by my side and\_feeling each one's unique way of breathing\_the world.\nWalking\
  \ the way, we were all speaking of that Cathedral, in Santiago De Compostela, in\
  \ Spain, the end\_and goal\_of that pilgrimage crossing Spain from the east to the\
  \ west side,\_but we were not even sure\_we would like that place!\nStill, we all\
  \ were motivated. The guitar\_playing\_in the first bar I stopped by and the singing\
  \ in Spanish made me feel in a great mood.\_\nI could summarize the pilgrimage\_\
  this\_way :\nWalk.\_ Be attacked by bees.\_Fall in love for 3 days. Sing. Dance.\
  \ Observe those huge wheat fields.\_Talk in\_Spanish, English\_and\_French\_for\
  \ half a day, and spend\_the other half hardly communicating with an Austrian\_\
  man. Walk backwards. Find a paradisiacal hostel where I met funny donkeys, affirming\
  \ their supremacy\_by\_eating people's sandwiches. Play ping-pong with an 80\_year\_\
  old beauty. Walk in silence. Leave the official way, come back into it. Love the\
  \ clear sky, love the heavy rain. Sleep outside, enjoy the stars and fear the wild\
  \ animals. Draw with those fancy eight-colours pencils. Be drawn while I sleep.\
  \ Help an old guy to restore his hostel. Believe a chicken-related legend told in\
  \ a Medieval church. Have a rest on a sofa in the middle of nowhere. Improvise music\
  \ with people from Spain, Germany, Lithuania, Australia and USA. Give words and\
  \ receive love. Write my first song. Leave my phone in the airplane mode for a week.\
  \ Feel comfortable\_in my soul and in my clothes. Share physical pain with another\
  \ pilgrim and laugh about it. Smell blue rhododendrons.\_Cross a nearly abandoned\
  \ Spanish town, and then enter in the city of Logro\xF1o which was organizing a\
  \ huge wine festival.\_Walk.\nAt the end of the pilgrimage, I felt glad for two\
  \ reasons.\nFirstly, during\_the\_walk,\_plans and deadlines\_were two concepts\
  \ that I could choose to consider or forget. Secondly, the pilgrimage allowed me\
  \ to overthrew my usual social codes, in such manner that I deeply connected with\
  \ some people I could have met only for a few seconds in my daily life.\nThinking\
  \ of those lessons, it appeared, totally unexpected because the clear weather shouldn't\
  \ admit its presence, right behind the Cathedral, gathering all the emotions inside\
  \ me, the most\_wonderful rainbow shining within myself."
