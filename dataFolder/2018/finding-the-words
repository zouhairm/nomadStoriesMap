Text: "I have spent the morning with my hands in the dirt, planting citrus trees on\
  \ the granja that supports this small community hidden away in the Ecuadorian jungle.\
  \ It is hard to believe that on just the other side of the mountains, the land is\
  \ spotted with scenic cities all clawing toward the wealth of the west coast. This\
  \ village is cut off from that, separated from the rest of the world by seemingly\
  \ insurmountable barriers.\n\nI notice a small child, maybe four years old, observing\
  \ me from a few yards away. She catches my glance and tentatively shuffles forward.\
  \ The leaders of my volunteer group had warned us that the local children frequently\
  \ watch and even help with the work. They love to meet the Americans.\n\nShe stands\
  \ quietly, fidgeting and grinning shyly at the ground.\n\n\u201C\xBFC\xF3mo te llamas?\u201D\
  \ I ask in poorly accented Spanish.\n\n\u201CMelanie,\u201D she responds.\n\nShe\
  \ is dressed in white, cotton shorts and a pink tank top, an outfit not unlike what\
  \ I see children wearing in the United States. I don\u2019t know by looking at her\
  \ whether she is one of the countless children in this area who are abused at home.\
  \ I don\u2019t know if she is among the majority who are malnourished or ill.\n\n\
  She mutters something to me in Spanish, but I don\u2019t understand. My knowledge\
  \ of the language barely extends beyond the phrases, \u201CHello,\u201D \u201CThank\
  \ you,\u201D and \u201CWhere is the bathroom?\u201D \n\nI tell her, \u201CI don\u2019\
  t speak Spanish,\u201D and shrug, embarrassed at my inadequacy. I am uncomfortable,\
  \ out of place, and I wonder for the thousandth time whether I have any right to\
  \ be here at all. I am a stranger to this land and to this culture.\n\nI am anxious\
  \ for her to leave, but Melanie just smiles. She reaches her hands toward my face,\
  \ and I know that she wants me to pick her up. A child raising her hands means the\
  \ same thing in all languages. I hold on beneath her arms and lift, gently resting\
  \ her wiry body on my hips. She wraps her tiny arms around me and buries her head\
  \ in the space between my shoulder and neck.\n\nAnd I understand her. We communicate\
  \ with our bodies and speak in a language that requires no words. She tells me about\
  \ her home, her life\u2014her past sorrows and future hopes. All this she tells\
  \ me through a simple touch. I hold her for a moment and rub her back, so she knows\
  \ that I understand. We do not share a culture, background, or even speech, but\
  \ this language is universal."
