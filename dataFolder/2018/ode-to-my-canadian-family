Text: "I met Amy and Daniel in 2013 while working as a chaperone. Flying from France\
  \ to Vancouver, Canada, I had hardly heard about them before my trip and I had absolutely\
  \ no idea what to expect. Though, they were going to be my host family for ten days\
  \ and the only thing I could do was to hope they were not about to kidnap me or\
  \ anything!\nThe teenagers I was in charge of and I arrived in Vancouver by night,\
  \ in the middle of June. Once we landed, I realized I did not know who I was looking\
  \ for until I heard an unassured voice calling my name. I looked up and saw a man\
  \ wearing a pair of flip-flops and a newsboy cap. Before I could ask if he was Mr.\
  \ Daniel\u2019s son, the man held out his hand and said with a smile \u201CHi! I\
  \ am Daniel, nice to meet you!\u201D I was indeed surprised since the actual Daniel\
  \ was probably in his thirties: I had in fact unconsciously depicted the Canadian\
  \ responsible as a white-haired, old man - do not ask why.\nThe way back to his\
  \ place was quite fun: Daniel realized he could not find the parking ticket and\
  \ that was because he had come to pick me up inside the airport living the ticket\
  \ in the machine outside. Then, as we had lost our way on the road, it took us two\
  \ hours instead of 45 minutes to reach our final destination! The positive point\
  \ was that, we had time to discuss and get to know each other a bit more. I was\
  \ really happy since it appeared that I had a lot in common with my host family\
  \ and their two young children.\nAnd indeed, I could not have dreamt of a better\
  \ host family. They were like perfect parents and children and their place really\
  \ looked like a cocoon, with its warm, friendly atmosphere. Amy and Daniel were\
  \ caring and thoughtful people including with me. They would make sure I had everything\
  \ I needed and even more. For instance, that summer, an unbearable heat had settled\
  \ in Vancouver and prevented me to sleep one night. When Daniel and Amy heard why\
  \ I was tired, they wanted me to switch my bedroom with their son\u2019s (what I\
  \ had refused to do).  Besides, they would take me to amazing places with breathtaking\
  \ landscapes, such as Alouette Lake and its almost unspoiled nature, or Grouse Mountain\
  \ and the stunning view it offered.\nI had left France quite uncertain about my\
  \ host family, but Daniel and Amy were just amazing, beautiful people. I was so\
  \ grateful to them I cried when I had to leave. I still had ten days left before\
  \ the end of the stay, but thanks to them, I knew I already wanted to come back\
  \ to Canada."
