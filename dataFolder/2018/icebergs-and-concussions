Text: "I landed in the South Island of New Zealand just after noon and I was planning\
  \ on driving from Christchurch airport to Queenstown. It\u2019s a drive that usually\
  \ takes about 6 to 8 hours in good weather conditions. The thing is, they drive\
  \ on the other side of the road here and I had never driven on the other side of\
  \ the road before today. This decision pushed me to an edge I had never experienced\
  \ before. \nI drove around the parking lot of the rental car company until I felt\
  \ confident enough to start the road trip. Not even 5 minutes outside the airport,\
  \ there is a roundabout. I take the first left and then, there is a big bang. Everything\
  \ goes all white. What is happening? My car is in the middle of the road and all\
  \ I can see is a big white cloud and nothing else, I can\u2019t see my hands, I\
  \ don\u2019t know where I am. \nParamedics show up and do a few tests to assess\
  \ my situation, I am concussed but everything else on my body is fine. What\u2019\
  s next? Mixed emotions, I\u2019m scared, confused, I just want to cancel this two\
  \ month trip and go back home. I have no one to talk to. My head hurts. How long\
  \ is this going to last?\nMy plan was to backpack New Zealand and there was nothing\
  \ that was going to stop me. I make my way to Queenstown on the bus. \u201CI close\
  \ my eyes and I feel something else. When I open them, everything seems so bright,\
  \ like it\u2019s in four dimensions. Are my contact lenses too strong?\u201D  I\u2019\
  m on the bus again, this time I\u2019m on my way to Mount Cook. I have a feeling\
  \ I\u2019m going to fall in love with this remote town. The next morning, I feel\
  \ a little better, it\u2019s been five days since my car accident and I finally\
  \ feel like being social, like talking to people and smiling. Even though I feel\
  \ like no one understands what I am going through, I do my best to get out there\
  \ and keep myself busy. \u201CMy head is pounding, like someone is squeezing it\
  \ really hard and hitting it repeatedly with a hammer.\u201D I don\u2019t know what\
  \ to do to make it better but one thing I know is that I wanted to see some icebergs\
  \ today and I was going to be doing just that. \nLooking back, I shouldn\u2019t\
  \ have made the decision to rent a car while I had no experience driving on the\
  \ opposite side of the road. But I didn\u2019t know that at the time. Although living\
  \ with a concussion is never easy, talking about it makes it slightly better. It\u2019\
  s hard to be understood because no one else is feeling what you are feeling, but\
  \ get out there and find what makes you happy, because it does get better."
