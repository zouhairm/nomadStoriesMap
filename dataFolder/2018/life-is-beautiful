Text: "When I open the car door, the clear, fresh mountain air fills my lungs and\
  \ I feel the choking nausea fading away. For the past two hours, we have been driving\
  \ steep serpentines up Mt Olympus that were so narrow we had to honk before each\
  \ bend to avoid collisions with cars coming the opposite way. Along the roadside,\
  \ little wooden crosses with names on them reminded us this frequently happens.\
  \ \u201CMostly motorcycles\u201D, Evangelia, my Greek friend, explains. She has\
  \ invited me to spend a local holiday at her grandparents\u2019 village.\n\nThe\
  \ village consists of mere 30 houses with thick stone walls to keep the heat outside.\
  \ A lot of them are abandoned, as the younger generation has left the village to\
  \ study or work in the cities. We start walking towards the plateia, the village\
  \ center, where festivities are about to start. I can see thousands of olive and\
  \ peach trees in the valley below us and in the far distance the blue sky blends\
  \ into the sea. Evangelia\u2019s grandfather Giannis joins me as I admire the scenic\
  \ view. \u201CWundersch\xF6n, ja?\u201D, he says to me in broken German. He points\
  \ towards the with heat shimmering horizon. \u201CThis is where we first saw the\
  \ German tanks coming\u201D. For a moment I freeze but his voice shows no bitterness\
  \ and his face no grudge. I don\u2019t know his age, but his wrinkly leathery skin\
  \ and piercing eyes tell the story of a man who has seen great sorrow and had a\
  \ life of hard manual work. It feels painful to know my ancestors occupied his country\
  \ for 4 years.\n\nA group of old women sit in the shadow of a plane tree, cutting\
  \ vegetables and offal. \u201C\xC9la, \xE9la!\u201D, they call and smile, come,\
  \ come.  I\u2019m handed a knife and pulled down on an old plastic chair, in front\
  \ of a pile of green beans and giant tomatoes. We communicate with hands and feet\
  \ and the little bit of Greek I know. Everybody in the village brings a stew, salad,\
  \ or home-distilled ouzo that gets a milky color from the water we add. On the field\
  \ next to us people take turns rotating the skewer with an entire lamb over an open\
  \ fire.\n\nAfter dinner, someone starts singing and the others join in. Not the\
  \ fast and happy Greek songs used in films: These are slow songs with long tradition\
  \ and beautiful melodies that touch me to the core. Songs a nation has sung for\
  \ decades to process their pain, as Giannis puts it. Although I do not understand\
  \ the lyrics entirely, I know they are about loss, deprivation, love and hope. About\
  \ life. \u201CEinai omorfi, einai omorfi i zoi\u201D, they are singing now: Life\
  \ is beautiful."
