Text: "It\u2019s when you\u2019re at your wit\u2019s end - when you\u2019ve walked\
  \ in the Balinese sun for 7 hours, desperately in need of that hat you left on a\
  \ bus in Bangkok a week prior; or when you pass an afternoon in bed, cursing that\
  \ questionable-smelling soup you so carelessly purchased from a street vendor in\
  \ Vietnam - that you are most aware of your own capabilities. Repeated failure is\
  \ a surefire route to success, and travel is nothing if not a series of self-inflicted\
  \ failures, funded by your dime and driven by your ambitions. \n\nThis brings us\
  \ to Bali. The country's capricious nature is perhaps most evident in its chosen\
  \ mode of transportation. If you\u2019ve ever spent a day in South-East Asia, you\
  \ are likely aware of the difficulty with which basic transportation is acquired.\
  \ Most travellers opt for a motorbike, making for a potentially dangerous and certainly\
  \ nerve-racking experience. \n\nNot that I\u2019ve ever ridden one. And maybe that\
  \ means I don\u2019t have the right to comment on them, but as an avid car-person,\
  \ I can say that you as a motorbike driver are very often near death - and at my\
  \ hands. At every turn I fear I'll be made an inadvertent murderer. Still, better\
  \ you than me, right?\n\nThe night in question - the last of my trip - the roads\
  \ were especially nightmarish; at night, the ills of the day are one hundred times\
  \ multiplied. Floating headlights zoom from side to side, their riders indiscernible\
  \ in the blackness. Honks emanate from unknown sources. People walking - to think!\
  \ walking! In this war zone! - line the streets in busy areas. But I was determined.\
  \ I had even begun enjoying the drive - that is, until I blew a tire and found myself\
  \ stranded on the side of an empty road.\n\nIt is in these moments that you ask\
  \ yourself - what kind of idiot would ever willingly embark on this trip? Is travel\
  \ just code for self-inflicted torture? \n\nYet it wasn't long before I found a\
  \ family, gathered in their yard chatting over a meal. I mimed my situation and\
  \ one of the younger men kindly replaced my tire. \n\nThere is no grand end to this\
  \ story. The man did not invite me back to his yard for a meal, where I learned\
  \ the essence of Balinese culture and the true meaning of travel. I did not go home\
  \ thinking that I\u2019d experienced the greatest adventure or that I\u2019d have\
  \ the wildest story to tell. But I no longer asked myself why I choose to travel.\
  \ Because that family, so willing to help an unknown and confused traveller on one\
  \ of their worst nights, was reason enough."
