Text: "The year of the Monkey was around the corner, and traditional decor consumed\
  \ the city of Guangzhou, China in a flood of bright red. At work, I was teaching\
  \ my 2-year-old Chinese students to make flags from red paint, gold stars, and paper\
  \ straws. Although teaching toddlers was thrilling, it was exhausting nonetheless.\
  \ The time had come for a holiday break and I was beyond ready.\n\u201CThe city\
  \ will be empty for the next few weeks,\u201D and \u201CYou\u2019re getting paid\
  \ time off. Go travel,\u201D was the general consensus when I sought holiday break\
  \ suggestions from friends. Not difficult to convince, I headed to Coron, Philippines\
  \ on the advice of a friend born and raised there.\nMy overnight ferry journey from\
  \ mainland Philippines to Palawan island was soon under way. A friend and I were\
  \ embarking on this trip together--the exuberance of exploring new territory was\
  \ in full swing--and we were booked in separate ferry cabins. I spied a man who\
  \ seemed to be traveling alone.\n\u201CWould you mind swapping rooms with one of\
  \ us?\u201D I inquired.\n\u201CNot at all, I\u2019ll grab my things. What brings\
  \ you to the Philippines?\u201D\nAn extensive conversation began and halfway through\
  \ we expressed our interest in becoming scuba certified. To our surprise and good\
  \ fortune, Allan Umali owned a dive shop in Coron.\nOur ferry would be docking long\
  \ before sunrise, and when asked if we had a place to stay Allan chuckled as we\
  \ shared an uncertain glance. He kindly offered temporary residence at the shop\
  \ with his family, along with a bit of breakfast and a promise to help us find a\
  \ room once the town was awake.\nDuring our scuba certification, Allan led us on\
  \ shipwreck dives for which Coron is famously known. The blue-green waters shimmered\
  \ with an allure I never knew possible and sunken WWII vessels rested in a hauntingly\
  \ beautiful slumber. Our encounter with Allan developed into much more than a scuba\
  \ diving connection, however. He introduced us in detail to Coron and its friendly\
  \ community, suggested activities unknown to travel guides, and invited us for home-cooked\
  \ meals to end each day. Without this warm (and accidental) welcome, I have difficulty\
  \ believing the trip would have been quite as charming.\nSomehow, a midnight introduction\
  \ to a local stranger led to admiration of an island I had once never heard of and\
  \ a friendship that continues two years later. Perhaps crossing paths with Allan\
  \ was never accidental after all, and forming friendships with locals is the secret\
  \ to seeing the true beauty of an unknown place."
