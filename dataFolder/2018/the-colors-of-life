Text: "My dear friends, you know if you think or see the world in the dull (black\
  \ and white) colors it means you definitely need to see the oculist.\n I probably\
  \ joked over myself saying this phrase while looking at the fading flame of fire.\
  \ We all sat close to each other and in turn told how we ended up at this gathering\
  \ point. We already knew each other as a year and a half, but we never had a chance\
  \ to find out what prompted us to abandon everything and to be here in the distance\
  \ from our homeland. When I sorted out the reasons for my arrival, I remembered\
  \ the book \"Shantaram\" meaning Man of God's Peace in Marathi language, \" Behind\
  \ the Beautiful Forevers: Life, Death and Hope in a Mumbai Undercity \" or the Indian\
  \ romantic film Aashiqui 2 which known as \"Life in the name of love\", but could\
  \ not determine exactly what was the main root causing my arrival. So this joke,\
  \ send the course of my thoughts in the right direction\nYou know how great it is\
  \ when there are no more than 10 people in your class. You are allowed to sit on\
  \ the first and second rows. And always looking at the world around me, I wondered\
  \ why the world is so sad and looks so dim, as if it lacks of colors. I thought\
  \ like this until I was not transferred to a more popular educational institution.\
  \ I began to sit on the last row, and this is the seventh or eighth row. Isn\u2019\
  t it awful? That's a moment when my school life turned into a paradise in the form\
  \ of white clouds with the background of the brown planet Earth-Board. Then I became\
  \ a four-eyes girl. I began to see the world more clearly, brighter and closer.But\
  \ these colors bothered me even after 12 years of wearing glasses. \nAnd one day,\
  \ watching the TV show about the two desperate travelers in India, I learned about\
  \ the festival of colors and residents watered them to each other. Thanks to this\
  \ program, I fell in love with this festival, music, dancing, that I forgot that\
  \ two-thirds of the country's population lives in doomed poverty, and their slums\
  \ are known all over the world.\nI was sitting at my workplace and looking into\
  \ the distance as the city's largest construction company is building high-rise\
  \ apartments for certain VIP customers and felt myself miserable and \"And what\
  \ about the slum dwellers?\" thought flashed through my mind. And I bought a ticket,\
  \ flew to the country, where despite the hardships of life people are still faithful\
  \ to the better life and enjoy every year festival of colors."
