Text: "This is not another eat, pray, a love story. You will not be finding yourself\
  \ reading the inner existential crisis of a mediocre western white woman in South\
  \ East Asia, leaving her inhibitions to the hands of idle men. This story is not\
  \ about love, although there has been love. It is not about second chances or some\
  \ sort of self-healing guru rendition of the young women who, against all odds,\
  \ made it out of poverty. This is a story about the reciprocity, adventure, globalization\
  \ and the interconnectedness of human existence and identity.\n \nAlthough I am\
  \ a white woman traveling alone through South East Asia, the last thing you would\
  \ ever expect is where I came from, where I have been, and where I am going. After\
  \ a string of failed relationships, I am not here searching for who I am. I know\
  \ who I am. This story is about my own agency, self-determination, and discovery\
  \ of how to manipulate the reality around me. It is about making connections between\
  \ the abstract and the foreign from the perspective of a young woman, pressured\
  \ by patriarchy; she rebelled with her tattoos and piercings to be her own hero\
  \ and potentially a hereon in the global effort for peace, justice, and equality.\n\
  \ \nAs I am riding a rickety rusted out blue bus that smells of petrol and cleaning\
  \ chemicals across a highway three hours north of Bangkok, I can\u2019t help but\
  \ reflect back on my life\u2019s journey. It has not been an ordinary one, drinking\
  \ imported beer along the Seine in Paris, research on war-related rape in Liberia,\
  \ dodging bullets at checkpoints in Occupied Palestine, how did a girl from a trailer\
  \ park in Michigan come to redefine her socio-economic status to take on the world\u2019\
  s most corrupt powers?\n \nWhen I retell my story, usually in a dust-covered Irish\
  \ pub located in the basement of the dodgiest place I can find, I always receive\
  \ the same reaction, \u201Chow old are you?\u201D Age is just a number, one that\
  \ is measured by an agrarian methodology, not your actual experiences here on Earth.\
  \ \u201CI\u2019m twenty-eight years old, but it feels like I\u2019ve lived someone\
  \ else\u2019s lifetime.\u201D\n\nI must forewarn you; this is not a romantic comedy\
  \ where I meet some amazing person who sweeps me off my feet. This is not a fairytale.\
  \ I do not sugar coat my sexual exploits, the death and destruction I have seen\
  \ working in conflict countries or lie about who is responsible. This also not some\
  \ humanitarian manifesto where I try to convince you to save the world or a jaded\
  \ description of how utterly fucked we all are."
