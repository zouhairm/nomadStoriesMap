Text: "\u201CTurn the damn GPS back on for god\u2019s sake\u201D James pleads, stressing\
  \ after my attempts of unsuccessfully navigating through Auckland\u2019s legendary\
  \ traffic. 30mins into our 10+ hour road trip and already we\u2019re lost. It\u2019\
  s December 29th and it\u2019ll take us a day or two of driving, since we\u2019re\
  \ taking a scenic route (honestly, they\u2019re all scenic), but we were hoping\
  \ to get down to secluded Gisborne City before New Years Eve. There\u2019ll be no\
  \ dawdling at this rate. \u201CIt IS on, it\u2019s still rerouting\u201D I hear\
  \ myself snap back, trying to follow the minuscule lines on the screen to judge\
  \ when the next turn-off is. Fortunately, the route loads first and a suspiciously\
  \ Siri-sounding voice is telling us to take the next left as we\u2019re about to\
  \ pass it. With considerable skill, James hurled the hire van around and catches\
  \ the exit, groaning in frustration at the late instruction. I burst out laughing.\
  \ He gives me a withering look and grumbles \u201CCan you at least tell me sooner\
  \ next time?\u201D \u201CIt\u2019s not my fault, it was rerouting!\u201D I answered,\
  \ still finding it funny but wary now of starting an argument. \u201CGuys, let\u2019\
  s not start to fight, we still have ages to go\u201D came Natalia\u2019s voice from\
  \ behind, playing the peacemaker. But I can see her grinning in the left-side mirror,\
  \ she hasn\u2019t got her license and she hardly plans on getting one yet. Normally\
  \ exceedingly laid back, it seems James has found his Mr Hyde counterpart behind\
  \ the wheel on the cramped, concrete confines of Auckland\u2019s busy highways.\
  \ And from a passenger\u2019s point of view, it may not be so funny, but if those\
  \ passengers happen to be a couple of the driver\u2019s sisters? Mate, it\u2019\
  s bloody hilarious. We make it out of the fast-paced metropolis, leaving behind\
  \ sun-blocking skyscrapers, torrential traffic, and cement buildings that are sprawled\
  \ like weeds. Outside of New Zealand\u2019s largest city, the world could not be\
  \ more different.  We drive through glades that block out the sun, entirely unalike\
  \ the city \u2018scrapers we left behind. Fingers of sunlight filtering through\
  \ the leafy canopy overhead create a gentle strobing effect when our van glides\
  \ through. The glades open out and suddenly we see veins of water trickling down\
  \ the rock face to our right, and to our left, the pulsing body of the Pacific thundering\
  \ against bone-white sand. This is the New Zealand I pictured, and the last thing\
  \ I expected after departing the man-made mass of mazes that is Auckland. Out here,\
  \ an untouched haven of natural wonders waits."
