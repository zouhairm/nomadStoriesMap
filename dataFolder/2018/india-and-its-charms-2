Text: "The world is beautiful and diverse. My first and foremost travel experience\
  \ is a trip to India, the country of interesting history and heritage. We were supposed\
  \ to visit Goa and Karnataka, so I had made a \u2018research\u2019 about those states.\
  \ Travel bloggers were only talking about how dirty India is, how poor it is, and\
  \ about sexual insults towards women. However, I saw different sides: I was rather\
  \ astonished by Indian hospitality, kindness towards everyone, and ability to accept\
  \ their fate even in poorness. \n Our trip started from the small town named Gokarna,\
  \ Karnataka state. Gokarna means \xABan ear of the cow\xBB from Sanskrit. According\
  \ to the legends, Shiva appeared out of the cow\u2019s ear in that place. Gokarna\u2019\
  s population is only 30000 people, the city is not as popular as Goa or New Delhi.\
  \ But people there are wonderful with their attitude towards both Indians and non-Indians,\
  \ because they do not identify themselves as bodies, as a majority of people all\
  \ around the world do. We tend to pay attention on unimportant things, such as places\
  \ of origin, skin color, physical appearance, and shapes of eyes. In Gokarna, people\
  \ are not interested in who you are, where you are from, but they are genuinely\
  \ warm and welcoming to strangers. They do not have any prejudices about Asians,\
  \ Europeans, Americans, or Africans \u2014 they will never judge your look. I did\
  \ not expect it from them as I used to think that everyone somehow has prejudices\
  \ and believes in stereotypes in some way. We should be learning from Gokarna\u2019\
  s people. \n In addition to wonderful people, this place disposes to seclusion and\
  \ self-discovery with its not crowded beaches and peaceful atmosphere. We did yoga\
  \ every morning, went to temples and meditated every evening. I had never felt so\
  \ relaxed, calm and full of energy at the same time. What better way to vacation\
  \ than starting your day with fresh fruits and spending time among spiritually developed\
  \ and kind people? Due to people\u2019s inner cleanness and positive vibes, I did\
  \ not pay any attention on dirt. I hate bazaars in my hometown as they are crowded\
  \ and dirty, but I loved walking down the one in Gokarna, despite it was as crowded\
  \ and dirty as ous. Perhaps, it is all about people who made such dirty places be\
  \ so comfortable and cozy. I did not before the trip that people make you feel convenient\
  \ and excited, not furniture and other physical objects. I am grateful for Indian\
  \ people who taught me to be open-minded and appreciate deep relationships"
