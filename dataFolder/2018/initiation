Text: "Calle de la Sal. Street artists. A dancer and the sparkling waves of her skirt.\n\
  The image of us, nomad souls, as a low-density flock that still moves together and\
  \ forms unique bodies.\n\nPlaza Mayor was a semi-desert but awake - a couple of\
  \ Chinese vendors, with small blue stools, offered the last half-summer shiatsu\
  \ massages for 5 euros.\nA moment later my arms were spinning around disjointed\
  \ and all the information and kilometres travelled from my day spent as a fl\xE2\
  neur, slightly detached from my person.\n\nI picked my backpack to leave, but soon\
  \ dropped it soon after.\n\nA boy was playing the banjo - self composed American\
  \ folk songs - an American touring the European streets. \nHis strawberry blond\
  \ beard and beige ribbed cap were perfect for his character as a penniless artist\
  \ in search of adventure, inspiration and fame.\n\nThat first evening Ignatio should\
  \ have hosted me but I hadn\u2019t heard from him and I had nowhere to go. It was\
  \ too late and I couldn't see any other solutions without a great deal of organization,\
  \ so I went to the square.\nThe next day he called me apologizing but it didn\u2019\
  t matter, the plans had changed now.\n\nI spent four days dancing barefoot and shaved\
  \ head on the streets and markets of Madrid. \nA green and brown dress; a plant\
  \ without earth that comes to life and offers the hat to the public.\nMike was an\
  \ expert hitchhiker and Madrid just the first stop. \nIt was already afternoon when\
  \ we moved away from the city to set off towards the highway.\nThe first lift didn\u2019\
  t take a long time to come.\nThe service station at the km 103 was more than busy,\
  \ huge, many trucks were passing by. We would have easily found someone but we were\
  \ tired and the evening was already falling. We slept in a field of very high wheat.\
  \ The ants did the same on us, it was a damp and itchy night but free under a starry\
  \ sky.\nAt seven o'clock in the morning we were ready, with big signs and his purple\
  \ suitcase, the drums, on which to sit and wait with the thumbs up.\n\nSpaniards\
  \ are warm, welcoming and friendly. But it wasn\u2019t common to take two young\
  \ travellers. They were surprised to see us there on the road and a little scared.\
  \ Certainly more were inclined to say no in that unexpected situation that we were\
  \ placing before them.\nIt took two days and a half to reach Barcelona and six years\
  \ have passed form that summer. \nTomorrow Mike is coming back to Europe with his\
  \ banjo and new songs. We didn't keep in touch but I hope to meet him again and\
  \ dance his music with longer hair."
