Text: "\u201CImbag ah ta naka-umay kayo,agyaman kami\u201D greeted by Mang Roberto,\
  \ a local fisherman who lives enough for a day. It is an Ilocano dialect that loosely\
  \ translates \u201CWe are glad you came to visit us\u201D. Our project team arrived\
  \ in a small shack near the river banks. We saw the children splashing against the\
  \ water current. Some of them jumped out the water and started running towards us.\
  \ They offered to give us a hand with the provisions we brought. It seems that they\
  \ have caught something, small fishes and some crabs perhaps? I thought to myself.\
  \ \n\nBut, something else caught my attention. It was an open nipa-hut structure\
  \ that stretches across the river. The floor is composed of stems of cogon grass\
  \ neatly tied together that extends to the river. It was strategically elevated\
  \ to trap fishes going downstream. They are caught in the small spaces of the floor\
  \ when strong currents flow during rainy season. The fisherfolks called it \u201C\
  Asal\u201D. A type of fishing gear used to catch all kinds of freshwater species\
  \ that dwells in the Amburayan River. The Asal was situated in the centre part of\
  \ the river. Small boulder of rocks was embedded into the water that borders both\
  \ sides of the Asal to direct the water current into the floor of the Asal. It acts\
  \ as catch basin especially when the water is murky after a heavy rain. While in\
  \ the water and the current is slow, we swam towards the Asal. I saw giant freshwater\
  \ prawns caught in between the floor of the Asal. The right pincer prominently larger\
  \ than the left. Before they feed, the larger pincer will \u201Cclean\u201D the\
  \ food in a sweeping manner, the locals say.\n\nWhen asked about their current predicament,\
  \ \"It was never easy\", Mang Julius' admitted. But, \"who says life was supposed\
  \ to be easy, you have to work hard for it. Like in fishing, there were times that\
  \ the net was always empty. I could not feed my family, sometimes for a week. But\
  \ we always get by, thankfully\". He added.\n\nOur brief stay in the community have\
  \ given me insights into the way of life of fisherman in the northern rural province\
  \ of the Philippines. I learned that their deep wisdom they possess have helped\
  \ them become resilient regardless of their overwhelming circumstances. People in\
  \ the fishing industry are among the poorest in the Philippines. The Philippines\
  \ is composed of 7,100 islands and was dubbed as highly diverse in aquatic resources,\
  \ flora and fauna. Yet, it does not support daily sustenance of a fisherman. It\
  \ is an unfortunate irony. A sad truth."
