Text: "And there you are, surrounded by thousands of foreigners in a place where the\
  \ only foreigner is actually you. It looks like no one trusts you and you trust\
  \ no one, since anytime you arrive somewhere you don't know what the next step would\
  \ be. Better not to create any expectations, every moment is unexpected. Suddenly,\
  \ you don't know how, when or why, but they make you feel as a piece of the puzzle.\
  \ People can only surprise you in the best way. \n\n  Travelling is not easy, and\
  \ usually the wide range of travel agencies can make the choice a little bit more\
  \ confusing. You get overloaded with information and in the end even disappointed\
  \ with the results. In fact, buying some simple bus tickets in Ko Chang (Thailand)\
  \ can become an adventure since you have to choose wisely where to get them and\
  \ who to get them from. However, I must admit that sometimes you can be very lucky\
  \ or maybe it's just the fact that angels do exist and it is not all about money\
  \ in some cases, there are people who actually do care about you.\nSo, here's my\
  \ luckiest day, we stepped into this little agency whose owner was a very sweet\
  \ Thai lady, who understood immediately that I was in \"trouble\". First of all,\
  \ she spoke to me in the most calmly way transmitting all her inner peace to me,\
  \ so I was able to explain my situation properly. (The thing is I needed to get\
  \ the quickest transport to get to Bangkok airport from Ko Chang at the best price\
  \ in order to get my flight back home on time) After attentively listening to the\
  \ story, with no profit intentions at all, this sweet lady sorted out everything\
  \ with just a phone call. At this point what else can you expect? There is more...\n\
  Once I got my ticket I was supposed pay a reasonable amount of money with no extra\
  \ charges, even though I did everything at the very last moment, what shows the\
  \ kindness of this lady. Nevertheless, I was not only running out of time but also\
  \ of money, as a consequence I couldn't pay the full price of the ticket. This lady\
  \ looked at me and uttered the most beautiful sentence I've ever heard,\n\"Don't\
  \ worry, you can pay me when you come back! Now, you go home and work hard so you\
  \ can come back to our island. Besides, I trust you!\"\n  In conclusion, if it wasn't\
  \ for the help this lady, I would have missed my flight and who knows...maybe I\
  \ wouldn't have been able to write this.\nIf you don't get to know the real local\
  \ people, those ones who are pure goodness, you don't really live the place, the\
  \ trip, the world...humanity."
