Text: "I coughed, I wheezed and I choked on the crisp thin air over and over again,\
  \ yet this pit in my stomach won\u2019t leave me. There\u2019s an almost false sense\
  \ of danger lurking round the corner and I feel almost abandoned, as they left me\
  \ alone to fend for myself in case something comes leaping towards my line of defence\u2013\
  which, in this case, was my hunched torso and flimsy crossed arms displayed as a\
  \ shield armour. \n\n\u201CI wish I had a better defence, but this has to do for\
  \ now!\u201D screamed a little voice at the back of my head, in a delusional attempt\
  \ to feel any form of relief. There\u2019s stench I couldn\u2019t comprehend, and\
  \ no matter how hard I tried to make sense of things, I simply couldn\u2019t grasp\
  \ the atrocity of the feelings that rumbled around my gut, like a washing machine\
  \ on high fleet.\n \nThey said this would be fun\u2013that this would be the best\
  \ experience of my life. \n\nThe anticipation was killing me. After an eight-hour\
  \ plane ride filled with colouring books and crayons, I thought the fun would start\
  \ once we landed Down Under. It was still summer, so the flies were buzzing around\
  \ as I tried to splat them flat, and the seagulls watched my every move like a hawk,\
  \ ready to pummel down to my palms as if lunch was served on a platter for them.\
  \ I knew for a fact that they would wrestle if it came down to that, so there was\
  \ no point in putting up a fight. \n\nIt all sounded like an alluring spot to sink\
  \ into.    \n\nSo why did we have to leave all that bustle for this mystery? I pondered\
  \ on that thought as my excitement for the new destination spiked higher, but it\
  \ eventually plummeted when the location was revealed before me.  \n\n\u201CIs this\
  \ really it?!\u201D I yelled to a confused set of parents, who was hoping I would\
  \ be exhilarated with their pick. I suppose I was, or believed I could be\u2026\
  \ but I wasn\u2019t there yet. They said the surprise only begins once we parted\
  \ ways. I held on tighter, but the grip loosened as I started to envision their\
  \ blatant dismay if I didn\u2019t let go. \n\nSo I did. I kept walking till an endearing\
  \ voice said, \u201CKeep your eyes closed and hands reached out,\u201D to which\
  \ I obey. As the recognisable stench grew, I knew the mystery was coming to an end,\
  \ so I slowly opened my eyes and bore the full weight in my arms.  \n\nAmidst the\
  \ thrill and repugnance, I was squealing and pulling the best smile I could. In\
  \ my arms laid a koala bear about the size of my five-year-old physique. \n\nIf\
  \ I expected Disneyland, I doubt that image would leave me in a fit today. \n\n\
  This one does."
