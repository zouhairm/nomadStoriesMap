Text: "I am a passionate traveler have travelled many places in India and abroad \
  \ such as United Kingdom,Thailand,Sri Lanka,Mexico and Saudi Arabia. Let me introduce\
  \  myself, I am working professional  Assistant Manager, Finance in one of the reputed\
  \ multinational companies in Jaipur, India live with my wife Pallavi and cute daughter\
  \ Tiyasha. Despite of  hectic work schedule  I  manage to take out some time  for\
  \ a vacation with my family. Travelling provides relaxation of my mind by giving\
  \ me a break from the busy life.\nThe country where I involved myself in connecting\
  \ with local people and culture is Mexico. In June 2016 I went to Mexico for 2 months\
  \ for Finance & Accounts Project from Genpact  India Ltd(my employer) so this trip\
  \  became official cum leisure trip. I was based in Toluca, client location which\
  \ is  62 kms from Mexico City  the capital of Mexico. While working in Toluca I\
  \ got the opportunity  to interact with Mexicans and know about their culture. During\
  \  working week at client location that is Monday to Friday I used to have the local\
  \ food of Mexico for lunch which is delicious and yummy quite similar to our Indian\
  \ food in terms of texture and taste. Mexican food such as Tacos and Enchilada \
  \ have  now become part of my  mouthwatering food list  and the Mexican cuisine\
  \ in one of top  10 best cuisines. Whenever there is any birthday celebration of\
  \ any person in Mexico instead of cutting birthday cake which is customary  in most\
  \ of the western countries or say India  Mexicans prefer to sing birthday song in\
  \ Spanish for the person and celebrate by  having chicken and any red meat (beef\
  \ or pork) tacos along with mayonnaise and salsa dips. I learnt some Spanish too\
  \ while interacting and greeting with the local people as it reminded me of a famous\
  \ quote in English when you are in Rome  do as the Romans do. For example  Hello\
  \ How are you in Spanish is translated \u201CHola Como Estadas\u201D.I visited Teotihuacan,\
  \ an ancient Mesoamerican city located in the State of Mexico 40 kms away from Mexico\
  \ City where I climbed on the top of the Pyramid of Sun through steep stairs which\
  \ was quite challenging but with my will power helped me to overcome the same. I\
  \  visited one of the famous pub  in Metepec  another town near to Toluca where\
  \ I did salsa  with my client along with Latin music at the background it was an\
  \ amazing experience.\nMy  trip to Mexico was a great as I got to meet some  wonderful\
  \ and hospitable people. To enjoy the beauty of any country making a local connection\
  \ is very important."
