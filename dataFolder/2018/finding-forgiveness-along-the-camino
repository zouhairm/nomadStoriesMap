Text: "It has been pouring down rain all day; I have never been so wet, and cold in\
  \ my life. The kind of cold you feel in your bones. We have been hiking since dawn;\
  \ my poncho dramatically rips off with a sudden gust of wind. In such a way, as\
  \ if god himself is punishing me for something. Everything I own is wet, making\
  \ it even heavier to carry. It is only my third day on the Camino, A 800k hiking\
  \ pilgrimage in Northern Spain. I approach a store, and go inside to buy a poncho\
  \ and dry off before continuing. There it Is, a vase of white lilies. A sign everything\
  \ is going to be okay, I am exactly where I need to be.\n   It has been one year\
  \ since losing my brother. But he did not die, I lost him to himself. I am mourning\
  \ someone I never truly knew, his demons weighing heavy on my shoulders; On the\
  \ Camino even a feather weighs a ton. I suffer a few more days, before having a\
  \ breakdown in a hostel basement while washing my lone two outfits. Out of supplies\
  \ and cash and with badly blistered feet, I decide to take the next day off, almost\
  \ ensuring I will not finish on time. Realizing suffering is a choice; I chose to\
  \ no longer suffer. \n  The day off is spent meeting new friends, drinking way too\
  \ much sangria, eating fresh local octopus, and making dinner together in our hostel\
  \ kitchen. The hostel, an old church perched on top of a hill in the middle of town.\
  \ The days are long, the distance far, but I am never truly alone.  At times I am\
  \ thinking about life, other times about nothing at all. My mind is completely silent.\
  \   \n   Dawn, with its damp smell, cool air, and mystifying fog, quickly becomes\
  \ my favorite time of day. The sounds and colors of nature as the sun rises and\
  \ the local cattle wake up. I am following my heart and body, walking only as far\
  \ as it tells me each day. Nights are spent with new friends at Pilgrims dinner\
  \ and bedtime is before sun set in tiny bunk beds.\n   At Cruz de Ferro, I told\
  \ the universe I forgive and left my rock among the others. Although I didn't believe\
  \ it myself, I put the words out into the universe. The burden of guilt would be\
  \ left there with my rock. \n   A few days later, I finished, finally making it\
  \ to Santiago. At the pilgrims mass a few powerful words spoken clearly in English\
  \ during the closing prayer. \"Forgive those who have lost their way\". I knew it\
  \ was time to forgive and move on. A massive weight was lifted from me, a weight\
  \ which was never mine to carry. I found the last thing I expected along the Camino,\
  \ forgiveness."
