Text: "At the time of arrival on the route heading northwest, we were 4 travelers.\
  \ We had the same desire to know the Ecuadorian jungle, to leave the accelerated\
  \ rhythm of the city and to immerse ourselves in the colorful landscape of monkeys,\
  \ toucans, parrots and the brown and green colors of the land. \nThe rules of the\
  \ game change when we explore unknown places. Places that we know are not home.\
  \ The night is not the same. As well as the days.\nWe arrived at El Coca \u201C\
  the door of the Amazon\u201D. Not being a city prepared for tourism made us feel\
  \ more like visitors than ever. There were no hostels and the non-luxury hotels\
  \ did not attract our attention. We were practically in the jungle and we had the\
  \ desire to literally live in it.\nMy favorite part of traveling is to explore without\
  \ time, to open up what it has to be. With that feeling, I decided to take a walk\
  \ trusting that loose and comfortable hang around would find a place for us to spend\
  \ a few days or the place would find me. \n\"El Coca\" as they call it is the place\
  \ for Ecuador coca plantations. It is a large city where you can see where the passage\
  \ of man-made has his trademarks but at the same time it has everything to make\
  \ you feel in the jungle. It is a gap, and it is also literally one of the last\
  \ places of civilization that give way to the deep Ecuadorian jungle.\nA striking\
  \ tourist business caught my attention. Doris a woman with strong indigenous traits\
  \ and with an almost rude posture began to ask me where I was from, how many we\
  \ were, where we were going and all that she could. Her daughter came to the place\
  \ and asked me only one question. How long we thought we were going to be in El\
  \ Coca, I told her definitively 5 days. They made a call, then they looked at me\
  \ and offered us to stay at their house.  At that point, I had the feeling of having\
  \ been at the right time and the right place. Those crazy things about traveling.\
  \ \nSharing the life of a family that belongs to the Kichwa (Quichua) communities\
  \ is to stop in time. The Napo River is their pool. To go to the bathroom, you have\
  \ to walk about 40 between bushes, trees, mosquitoes and snakes. The monkeys make\
  \ a feast in that house that has no windows closed with glass, only curtains that\
  \ allow them to steal the first thing they can find.\n\"El Coca\" and Doris family\
  \ made us part of their culture, sharing not only breakfasts and grilled fish but\
  \ also their songs, their indigenous wisdom of healing and their magical knowledge\
  \ with plants."
