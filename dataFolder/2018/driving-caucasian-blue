Text: "\u201CWhat nationality you are?\u201D the hotel interpreter huddling next to\
  \ the driver twists rearward chummily. His English is a classic of the local variety,\
  \ with Azerbaijani inflection and syntax. A way to convey a message about the meaning\
  \ of globalization? In this land, the message seems to be about all-absorbing Caucasian\
  \ hospitality; mountain folk throw a feast to greet strangers: \u201CA guest is\
  \ a gift of God.\u201D\nI struggle with a familiar sense of discomfiture: I try\
  \ to hide it that we do not ask about nationality in the countries I call home;\
  \ the question is a travesty of privacy, individuality\u2026 I lapse into schoolbook\
  \ truths untranslatable into the lingua franca of the Caucasus.  \nMy speaking Russian\
  \ is seldom a help in this post-Soviet union of traditional regions, where the backlash\
  \ against waves of colonialism by the giant neighbor has made a hodgepodge of allegiances.\n\
  \u201CBut you must have a nation?\u201D Azerbaijanis insist. \u201CSo you have a\
  \ nationality?\u201D\nDisembarking from the train from Baku in Ganja, the country\u2019\
  s second largest city, I breathed in a new kind of mountain air. Ganja is free of\
  \ the stranglehold of the capital\u2019s reach, and home to \"universities\" spanning\
  \ the modest gamut of professions imaginable to the region's oil-dominated labor\
  \ market. Even more powerful of a pull (with PUL being the Azerbaijani for \u201C\
  money\u201D!) is Guy Gol, or Blue Lake. No misnomer, the name gestures toward a\
  \ natural aquatic deep tucked into the mountains. The waters are so silent and silencing\
  \ in their majesty that even the impromptu state decision to open the area to visitors\
  \ has not yet led to its being spoiled. Crowds now stroll along the slopes only\
  \ recently labeled within the zone of fire (from ubiquitous Armenian artillery conjured\
  \ up and reported at will in the vicinity of the border); they are still dwarfed\
  \ by the blue. The deep transcends the limits of dimension, suffusing the view.\n\
  Smiling at the interpreter, I sneak around to ask more questions of the driver,\
  \ a professor first jailed for work in promoting East-West academic exchange (the\
  \ court sentence stated this was armed assault and inflicting knife wounds in a\
  \ drunken brawl), then released upon being presidentially amnestied, all within\
  \ the same year. The courtroom was filled with students, he notes, perfectly quiet,\
  \ during the hearing; they burst into singing Azerbaijan\u2019s national anthem\
  \ once his jail sentence had been read out.\nI want to close a private deal about\
  \ getting out of town, and on to the lake, asap."
