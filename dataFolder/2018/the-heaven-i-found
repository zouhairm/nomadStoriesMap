Text: "My trek to kumaraparvatha\n\nWhen all my brother's used to say about trekking\
  \ i was why shouldn't i try the adventure??\n It was my semester Holidays when i\
  \ called my brother to ask about some trekking spot than my brother asked me ll\
  \ u join with us to trek the kumaraparvatha the trekkers paradise  without second\
  \ thought i said yes ... The day of my dream came true we departured to reach the\
  \ kumaraparvatha our journey started whole night mrng 6 we reached the base  then\
  \ we started our trek to peak which was about 15+ km with about 60degree slope and\
  \ that to i was a monsoon season, we captured our group pic of 30 members we began\
  \ our trek with all the energy that Melody's of the forest kept on motivating us\
  \ and that green nature made our eyes pleasent and the beautiful pics were shot\
  \ and in the half of the way of trek we found a waterfalls which was as pure as\
  \ mineral water we enjoyed swimming for a few hours and took rest then we were about\
  \ to start our trek back we clouds started to roar and the rain's started heavily\
  \ we continue our trek with high energy the path of our trek was like a river flowing\
  \ down from a hills with almost about an height of one and a half feet water were\
  \ our foots were submerged we continued our trek to reach the peak and after our\
  \ trek of about almost 6hrs we reached to peak and started our campaign then we\
  \ had our dinner and we started our celebration of the peak by playing music and\
  \ dancing and creating our own dj mixes and all slept and in the morning we just\
  \ woke up and unzipped our tents their was a amazing view which made us all that\
  \ we are the  foolish people think of heaven after death when heaven is next to\
  \ us it was just awesome feeling of standing on the peak and watching the MOTHER\
  \ NATURE we feeling that we are in the heaven"
