Text: "When I closed the jeep door at the entrance of the Annapurna range, I never\
  \ thought about my feet carrying me the remaining 4130 meters to base camp. I awakened\
  \ full of positivity, having met a group of Spanish walkers and their inspirational\
  \ guide, we decided to depart on the challenge together. After hours of constant\
  \ climbing, the epic reality of what I\u2019d started was dawning on me like our\
  \ 6am wake up call. \n\nThen it came. The winds blew around me until the skies unleashed\
  \ a relentless storm. We continued to press on until we had to seek asylum from\
  \ the bitter cold that had infected our bodies like a disease. I prayed that the\
  \ conditions would calm before my blistered ankles carried me onto the penultimate\
  \ day of our ascent. \n\nIt didn\u2019t take long for the heavens to open once more\
  \ as we creeped further through the beautiful range towards the 10th highest (and\
  \ deadliest) peak in the world. The heaters under our lunch table blinked to a miserable\
  \ death and a thundering crash from outside sprung us to our feet simultaneously.\
  \ Our guides gave each other a look of familiar terror, landslide. The bridge that\
  \ we had crossed minutes before was swept away effortlessly and my mind raced to\
  \ dark places. Soon the question arose among the group, do we continue towards base\
  \ camp or turn back and say goodbye to reaching our summit forever? Despite the\
  \ enormous risk I was determined to beat this mountain. \n\nI heard it before I\
  \ could see it. The rapid raged its way through our path and any form of crossing\
  \ had been carried away by the deep and deadly water. Before I could process what\
  \ we were about to do, our guides were entering the suicidal river. They built a\
  \ crossing by strategically moving boulders into place but the jump between the\
  \ rocks was still huge and I tried to avert any thoughts of slipping into the frozen\
  \ cascade. One by one trekkers five reached safe ground and it was my turn. The\
  \ leaps of faith I made were completely powered by adrenaline and trust in my guide.\
  \ \nThe death rate of Annapurna is 35% in comparison to Everest\u2019s 3%. The decision\
  \ I made that day could have cost me my life but I was soon rewarded with something\
  \ that made every pain staking footstep worth it. \n\nFor the first time since leaving\
  \ civilisation, the clouds revealed the soaring summit of Annapurna 1, standing\
  \ at 8,091 metres. Uncontrollable sobs of joy escaped me. Annapurna drove me to\
  \ the edge but it gave me a reason to never stop chasing my wild dreams around this\
  \ beautiful globe."
