Text: "No one told me that Paris gets cold at night. Perhaps I underestimated how\
  \ quickly the damp air gets under your skin. I felt so far away from Alaska, from\
  \ the cold that stampedes you in the face with every blink. Invincible. Yet, nighttime\
  \ in Paris taught me that you can run, but you cannot hide from a chill that wants\
  \ to get you. \n\nThank God for the crepe stand boy. \n\nHe was young, but so was\
  \ I. He asked me where I was from as he slid the crepe batter across the pan, the\
  \ mixture impossibly thin. \n\n\"Alaska,\" I said. \n\n\"Glasgow?\" he asked, curious.\
  \ \"You don't look Scottish.\" \n\n\"No,\" I replied, giggling, \"Alaska. Like,\
  \ polar bears and igloos.\" \n\nHe blinked at me, his eyes blank. He had no idea\
  \ what I was talking about, but he gave a polite nod. We both dropped the subject,\
  \ but he shot curious glances at me as he assembled the rest of the treat. \n\n\
  I walked away with a piping hot crepe, the steam rising to meet the frosty air.\
  \ It warmed me up, first in the soul and then everywhere else. French food has a\
  \ way of doing that. \n\nThe next night I found myself in that same area. Same cold.\
  \ Same stand. Same boy. I walked up to him, in desperate need of my fix. Before\
  \ I could say, \"S'il vous plait,\" he had the batter poured. And before I could\
  \ hand the money over, he instead placed something in my hand. I looked down to\
  \ find a peach sitting in my palm, the sweet summer fruit feeling out of place in\
  \ the night air. \n\n\"I figured you don't get those in Alaska,\" he said, unable\
  \ to hide how proud he was of himself. \n\nSo he had heard me. \n\n\"Not really,\"\
  \ I said, unsure of the protocol. Did I try to give it back, or did I just accept\
  \ graciously? \n\n\"It's for you,\" he said, saving me. \"I thought of your smile\
  \ last night and grabbed it on the way over here.\" \n\nOn instinct, I brought the\
  \ peach to my nose and breathed in deep. It smelled like sunshine, fresh and new\
  \ and soft. I had never smelled anything like it before. He was right; we don't\
  \ get peaches in Alaska. Not ones like that. \n\nI took my crepe that night and\
  \ left a generous tip, hoping to make up for the cost of the fruit. The next morning,\
  \ as planned, I packed my bags and left my hotel. Passing by the crepe stand, I\
  \ saw a different boy working. I didn't ask the cab driver to stop. The stand had\
  \ no name anyway. \n\nTwo months later, I sat in a cafe near home, the snowing falling\
  \ steadily on icy roads. The waitress took my order for crepes. \n\n\"Anything else?\"\
  \ she asked. \n\n\"Yeah, do you have any peaches?\""
