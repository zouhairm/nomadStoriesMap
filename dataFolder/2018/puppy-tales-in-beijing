Text: "One day last Spring my husband and I passed an outdoor market here in Beijing\
  \ that we had frequented on several occasions. In addition to selling household\
  \ items, shoes, jewelry, and antiques, a few vendors sold goldfish, rabbits, baby\
  \ chicks, turtles, and occasionally kittens. I had, thankfully, never seen a dog\
  \ amongst the menagerie.  But this day was different.\n\nTwenty feet from the market\
  \ entrance stood an elderly Chinese lady.  She was tiny by North American standards,\
  \ and she seemed bent from the weight of the many layers of clothing she wore. I\
  \ was immediately drawn to her because she looked like someone you would see in\
  \ a National Geographic photograph.  She was also keeping watch over two tiny mixed\
  \ breed puppies who were perched precariously on top of a wire cage.  I left my\
  \ husband standing on the sidewalk and headed straight for tiny bundles.\n\nMy enthusiastic\
  \ approach startled one of the puppies and before I actually touched him he twisted\
  \ around tumbled off the cage.  I reached down to break his fall and out of sheer\
  \ terror, he bit me on the thumb.  I knew I couldn\u2019t let him go or he\u2019\
  d be lost in the crowd or run over by a motorcycle, so with the puppy shrieking\
  \ in my grasp, and my thumb dripping blood, I searched the growing crowd for the\
  \ owner.\n\nThe old lady had turned just in time to see the events as they unfolded,\
  \ and she immediately headed toward me - no doubt to rescue the puppy.  Before I\
  \ could apologize, she grabbed my hand, stuck my thumb in her mouth and began to\
  \ suck!  Feeling a little faint, I glanced around in search of my husband. He was\
  \ the only foreigner in the crowd so it wasn\u2019t hard to spot him. The look of\
  \ disbelief on his face was impossible to describe, but I\u2019m sure it mirrored\
  \ the look of disbelief on my own face.\n\nAfter a few seconds, the old lady released\
  \ by thumb from her mouth, spat skillfully onto the sidewalk, stepped on the bloody\
  \ splotch and twisted her foot as though she were stepping on a lit cigarette. Repeating\
  \ the procedure one more time, and satisfied that she had done what she could, she\
  \ took my thumb out of her mouth, spat again, reached for the puppy, and abruptly\
  \ resumed her negotiations with a wouldbe customer.\n\nI didn\u2019t expect to share\
  \ such an intimate moment with a complete stranger when I headed out the door that\
  \ morning, but that is one of my favourite memories of my time in Beijing.  I hope,\
  \ if that little old lady ever reflects back on that day as I have done so many\
  \ times, it makes her smile too."
