Text: I have come to that stage in my life where I feel I am done with being a timid
  person. Also I feel that I am hated by almost everyone I know and I can't bear that.
  Even my husband and kids think that I am an embarrassement to them because I am
  at the age where I have acute anxiety due to hormonal changes in my body (being
  a woman of 42) so I feel and desparately feel that I have to go to some place where
  nobody knows who I am, coz here everyone knows me as my husband's wife. I am totally
  financiallly dependent on my husband and have to ask for small amount of money from
  him. So whatever little savings I have I want to spend and go somewhere where I
  can gain my long lost confidence and explore the new confident me. I want to have
  my broken pieces of self get together bit by bit and want to be reborn and evolve
  as a NEW ME. Now this is the mission of my life to explore as much of the world
  as I can coz I really want to have my own identity and also see who is bothered
  by me being away--my Husband SURE NOT....rather it will be a BIGGG FAVOUR for him
  if I leave him coz he enjoys other women much more than me, or my teenage kids who
  but naturally are also busy in their own fancy worlds this point in their lives.
  And if I am given a chance to be away for some timw, whether they would miss me
  or want me back....only my kids or a few of my siblings , my husband will never
  miss me coz he wants to re marry and nobody else as I lost my parents..oh maybe
  my dog...he would surely miss me ..maybe for sometime coz he has other family to
  look upto. So all said and done....I reallllly want someone to just give me an oppotunity
  to find the real me!!!
