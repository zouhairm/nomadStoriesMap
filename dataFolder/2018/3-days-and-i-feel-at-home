Text: Last year I got the opportunity to travel to Europe and backpack across 6 countries
  and 10 cities. During the second leg of my trip, I arrived in Ireland. Though I
  was excited to visit a new place, I had no idea what to expect. What I found was
  a city full of laughter, community, history, and a place I would fall in love with.
  To this day, I can't say that I can't place my finger on what exactly I love, but
  rather it was the sum of the whole, that makes Dublin my favourite destination.
  There are several things I can say I loved though. The free walking tour I went
  on, which is by far the best walking tour I went in while in Europe, made me laugh
  until my stomach hurt. All the while, I felt like I was getting to learn so much
  about the history of the city. On a separate trip, I travelled to some smaller cities
  near Dublin, and although they did not have much to do there, the atmosphere was
  just one that spoke to me. Though, I did want to stay in a castle in western Ireland,
  and the quaint little towns gave me a glimpse of "castle life". In one of the simplist
  towns, I still felt breathless. And the locals... Don't even get me started. Every
  one of them as sweet as the next. One of them even helped cheer me up when I wasn't
  feeling down one day. It was not necessarily very different from other cities I
  travelled to later on in my trip, nor is it one of the most popular tourist destinations,
  but it became one of the most memorable for me, and I'm already planning my next
  trip back. So much so, that I'm even considering taking a future career there, so
  that I can live in the city and experience it as a local.
