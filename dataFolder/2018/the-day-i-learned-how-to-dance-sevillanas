Text: "I had been learning flamenco for five years but the fourth sevillana was something\
  \ I still wasn\u2019t able to do. Sevillanas are a folk dance from southern Spain.\
  \ They are composed by four equal parts and danced by couples during local celebrations.\
  \ Those who intend to learn flamenco usually start by Sevillanas, but I started\
  \ somewhere else and five years latter I was still struggling with the fourth part\
  \ of the dance.\n\nI was 24 years old and really in love with Spanish culture. So\
  \ as soon as I got a job that paid me enough, I saved some money and went for a\
  \ trip around Madrid, Cordoba, Granada and last, but not least, Seville, the temple\
  \ of those who want to learn more about flamenco.\n\nUnfortunately, all the flamenco\
  \ shows in town were out of my budget. There were lots artists doing amazing performances\
  \ in the streets, and the flamenco museum had some really great exhibitions, but\
  \ nothing felt like the experience I was looking for. \n\nRefusing to give up, I\
  \ decided to ask in the hostel if someone knew about a place where I could see some\
  \ real flamenco action at a reasonable price. One of the owners told me about a\
  \ bar called \u201CCasa Anselma\u201D. \u201CBut is more like a Sevillana place\u201D\
  , he added. \n\nHaving nothing to lose, I decided to go. From the hostel it was\
  \ a 15-minute walk and the night was really nice. I remember thinking that even\
  \ if I couldn\u2019t see all the flamenco that I dreamt about, I was grateful about\
  \ that trip. Two blocks after crossing the Triana Bridge, I arrived at Anselma\u2019\
  s door. And it was closed.\n\nGratitude floated away and gave space to some anger,\
  \ but just in case, I decided to wait for a few minutes. When I was almost giving\
  \ up, Anselma arrived, with polka-dots pants and a pink blouse, shouting something\
  \ about the musicians being late.\n\nI entered the bar, a small place packed with\
  \ pictures of costumers and artists, and before I could blink, Anselma was pointing\
  \ to a chair and shouting: \u201CRum or gin?\u201D. In a few minutes, the place\
  \ was crowded with locals playing, dancing and singing sevillanas. Anselma herself\
  \ danced and sang some tunes. I was ecstatic, but at the same time a little disappointed\
  \ of not knowing how to do that, even after five intense years of flamenco classes.\n\
  \nA gentle old man asked me to dance. I explained him my inability, but he didn't\
  \ care and before I could realize, there I was, dancing the fourth sevillana without\
  \ even knowing how to do so. It was the last thing I expected, but it was much better\
  \ then my higher expectation."
