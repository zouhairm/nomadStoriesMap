Text: "\u201CNo, I couldn\u2019t possibly\u2026\u201D\n\nShe said as a smile twisted\
  \ on her large red lips in a mix of humility and gratitude. But now everyone looked\
  \ at her. Realizing this, she closed her eyes, nodded, and started singing. It was\
  \ Chinese opera, this dusty hostel had become her stage, and China changed for me\
  \ forever.\n\nThree days before, opera was the last thing on my mind when she introduced\
  \ herself by striding into our shared dorm and declaring that the room was \u201C\
  wrong, all totally wrong!\u201D With a large face and electric eyes, Zhang Li never\
  \ lost her performer's penchant for anchoring the room's attention to her. Down\
  \ from Beijing, she came to explore the best of Sichuan\u2019s temples and I quickly\
  \ was informed that, \u201Cyou\u2019re coming with me\u201D\u2014no excuses.\n\n\
  Through her, I saw a beauty in China that I never could alone. We explored these\
  \ temples through their intricate gardens, the stories carved into walls, the great\
  \ scholars staring down from the semi-darkness. The golden dragons on the roof.\
  \ \u201CI love these places. The Tao is China.\u201D But she looked away for a second.\
  \ \u201CSorry. The Tao was China.\u201D\n\nHer grandparents were sent to the countryside\
  \ during the cultural revolution; her uncle, who was in Beijing in 1989, heard the\
  \ bullets come so suddenly, \u201Che thought it was festival fireworks going off.\u201D\
  \ She pointed out all the glass towers that, sitting on top of temple graveyards,\
  \ shouldn\u2019t be there, or going through a sprawling temple complex in the hills\
  \ and finding an escalator drilled into the mountain. Though she\u2019d trained\
  \ to sing in the Jingju (Beijing opera), faced with declining career prospects,\
  \ turned to finance to support her family. \u201CI always wanted to, only\u2026\u201D\
  \ She looked away, her gaze falling on the row of teahouses turned into souvenir\
  \ stands. \u201CThe spirit of that China is lost.\u201D\n\n But in the hostel around\
  \ a crowd of locals and foreigners, after the right amount of beers and encouragement,\
  \ we get her to sing, and the present unravelled in the rising waves of her voice.\
  \ Uncomfortable as it was captivating, every note she sung sent shivers up my spine\u2014\
  we barely breathed. And I understood, finally, why I\u2019d been drawn to China:\
  \ it was the mystery in her voice, the way Zhang Li disappeared behind a mask of\
  \ emotions with words I couldn\u2019t understand but felt all the same. She stopped,\
  \ abruptly, and after a shocked second, the room exploded with applause. Her encore\
  \ came standing on the table.\n\nThat spirit can\u2019t be lost. Not yet."
