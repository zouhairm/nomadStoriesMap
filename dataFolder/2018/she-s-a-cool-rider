Text: "I remember the blinding sunlight. The melting tar on the road. My fringe stuck\
  \ to my forehead a little but I would not dare to remove my helmet and visor. Riding\
  \ downwind of the trucks full of squawking chickens was a terrible idea. The black\
  \ seat under my thighs was burning, the only respite was to pull on the throttle\
  \ and zoom a little faster, aiming for patches of shade from the tropical evergreens\
  \ and bamboo that line this part of the country\u2019s roads.  \n\nThe lure of cool,\
  \ rushing mountain water at our destination had been enough to rouse us from bed\
  \ in near darkness to get on our scooters and head North. It had been weeks since\
  \ we had lost the remnants of sand off our feet, and a decent all-consuming cool-off\
  \ was well overdue. The haphazard directions given to us by the tourist office the\
  \ day before wound us around local villages, passed nail salons, noodle shops, road-side\
  \ fruit stalls and markets, nearing the Si Lanna National Park.\L\nAs we turned\
  \ a sharp left at another intersection that can only be described as organised chaos,\
  \ a group of equally sweaty Thai police officers lazily waved their arms indicating\
  \ we should pull over. Bringing my battered 100cc Honda into as controlled of a\
  \ stop as I could in front of the cordon, I tried to recall whether I had packed\
  \ my license in the blur that was that morning. My mind raced with the warnings\
  \ and scary stories from other travellers about corrupt cops, bribery and threats\
  \ of seedy Thai jails all in the name of scooter safety.\n\nPutting the stand down\
  \ on my bike, trying to look more adept than I felt, and removing my sticky helmet,\
  \ I attempted my best \u201CSawadee Ka\u201D in the general direction of the five\
  \ officers lounging on their motorcycles. The muddy puddle on the ground began to\
  \ look increasingly like the closest thing we would see to a waterfall today. The\
  \ chubbiest of the five officers slowly paced towards my bike, the jaunt of his\
  \ beret not making his appearance any less authoritative. A drip of sweat ran down\
  \ behind his dusty sport sunglasses.\n\nMy sun-reddened hands riffled swiftly through\
  \ my backpack for some form of documentation that might help the escalating situation,\
  \ while I stammered, \u201CW-would you like to see m-my International Driver\u2019\
  s Licence?\u201D.\n\nThe buttons on the advancing officer\u2019s shirt strained\
  \ as he came to an immediate stop in front of me.  Twisting his face to his troop\
  \ and then back to me, he shouted in slightly accented English, \u201CAh, you\u2019\
  re from New Zealand? We love the All Blacks!\u201D"
