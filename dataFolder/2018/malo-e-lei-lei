Text: "\u201CDo you want to come drink Kava?\u201D\nThe Polynesian archipelago of\
  \ Tonga is known as the Friendly Islands for a reason. After a busy week of exploring\
  \ the island of \u2018Eua, I have taken some time to relax and process everything\
  \ I\u2019ve seen \u2013 geyser-like blowholes spurting through the rocks; towering,\
  \ tangled Banyan trees, as wide as a house; the barnacle encrusted face of a surfacing\
  \ humpback whale. However, Mone, my host and self-appointed tour guide has other\
  \ ideas.\nThroughout the Pacific, the root of the Kava plant is ground to produce\
  \ a drink, enjoyed in ceremonies varying from nation to nation. In Tonga, the drinking\
  \ of Kava, or Faikava, is traditionally a male event, as a woman, to be invited\
  \ is a true honour; something I cannot turn down.\nWe drive down to the neighbouring\
  \ village of Ha\u2019atua, stopping past the magnificent white Mormon Church, by\
  \ a small meeting hall or Fale Fakataha. Inside, a rainbow of woven mats is laid\
  \ out, and a variety of male faces from the community sit cross-legged in a circle.\
  \ The air is bubbling with chatter and around me the smiles are contagious. Hands\
  \ pat an empty space, the universal language for \u201CSit here, stay with me.\u201D\
  \ Mone beams encouragingly, his dark braids bobbing as he nods.\nOne man, older\
  \ with close-cropped greying hair, produces a guitar and the whole room joins him\
  \ in songs in the native Tongan language, hands tapping on knees and floor. I sway\
  \ along, letting the sounds wash over me, as the Kava is produced. A wide, deep\
  \ dish holds the murky liquid and the single cup is passed directly to me; my honour\
  \ as the new comer. Shyness overwhelms me. What if I do it wrong? What if I make\
  \ a huge faux pas and shame Mone? Unsure of any protocols, and no way of gaining\
  \ any insight my heart begins to pound in my ears. Nervously, I look up and to my\
  \ surprise, my gaze is met by a sea of brown eyes twinkling in reassurance. Emboldened,\
  \ I lower my mouth to the cup and take a tentative gulp. It\u2019s cold. And soon\
  \ my tongue begins to tingle and a limp muddy aftertaste wells on the floor of my\
  \ mouth. I twist my grimace into what I hope is an appreciative smile and pass the\
  \ mug back. I\u2019m met with a nod and a smile, baring uneven and stained teeth.\
  \ I\u2019ve done it right. I bow my head, \u201CMalo. Malo \u2018aupito.\u201D I\
  \ stammer.\n\u201C\u2019Lo malo,\u201D the man replies gently.\nMone and I stroll\
  \ back in darkness. Above me the only thing I recognise is the silver streak of\
  \ the Milky Way. A pig skitters in the undergrowth. It really does feel like another\
  \ world."
