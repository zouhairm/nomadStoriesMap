Text: "There's always a stone shack crumbling, the roof lying next to it or caving\
  \ in.  The sea, too, is always there.  Then there's lemon trees and grass sweeping\
  \ through, waterlines draped on top, twisting around the timeworn trunks. Then olive\
  \ trees and cactuses and hawks perched on decrepit fence posts and hulls rusting\
  \ on slivers of rocky beach.  And another town of concrete buildings and graffiti\
  \ and balconies and drying laundry.   Another station with no one waiting. The passengers\
  \ murmur and I nod off to sleep.\nWhen I awake we're stopped in a big station and\
  \ I see a man coming down the aisle.\n'Cafe, cafe, cafe,' he says.\n'Lau, wake up.\
  \ Coffee!'\n'What?' she says jumping up. 'I thought there was no bar.'\n'There's\
  \ not, there's this guy.  Signor, cafe!'\n'Quanto?' \n'Due,' I say.\nHe then puts\
  \ tiny plastic cups in front of us and fills them halfway with thick coffee from\
  \ a big blue thermos.  Then he puts two cakes in plastic wrappers next to the coffee.\n\
  'No, no, no.'\n\"Tutto compreso,' he says smiling.\nLau looks at me and says nothing.\n\
  'It's included,' I say. \nThen he puts four sandwiches down in front of us, where\
  \ they came from I don't know. \n'Oh great, Lau, sandwiches.  We don't have to eat\
  \ Oreos for lunch. You want one?'\n'Okay.'\nI hand him back two of the sandwiches\
  \ and just say, 'Due sandwich.'\n'Bibita, bibita,' he says and he puts an ice tea\
  \ in my hand and orange soda in front of Lau.\n'No, no, no,' I say. 'No bibita.'\n\
  'Compreso,' he says.\n'It's included, too.' I say. 'Quanto?'\n'Ventinove.'\n'Twenty-nine,'\
  \ she laughs. 'Why don't you just give him all that cash in your hand?'\nI hand\
  \ him back the drinks and say, 'No bibita.'\n'Diccianove,' he says.  He then takes\
  \ out a one euro coin to illustrate to me that it is nineteen and that I will receive\
  \ one euro in change.\n'That's expensive for two sandwiches and two sips of coffees,'\
  \ I say to Lau and then hand him back the sandwiches. \n'Sei,' he says.\n'Cinque.'\n\
  'Sei.' he says, not understanding that I'm negotiating.\n'Cinque.'\n'Sei,' he says\
  \ holding up six fingers.\nI get nervous, give him the money.  He walks away.\n\
  'How amateur,' she says.\n'I'm not used to having to haggle.'\n'You've traveled,'\
  \ she says.\n'Traveling is not a skill.'\n'You get this naive look when you don't\
  \ know the language,' she laughs.\n'He's lucky I don't report him.'\n'To who?' she\
  \ decries.\n'He invented those prices out of thin air.  That's not good practice!'\n\
  'Honey, Love, he doesn't care.'"
