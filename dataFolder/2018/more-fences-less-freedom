Text: "By that evening, I had already watched the sun rise over a red crater, the\
  \ colour of a child\u2019s wax crayon. I had already drunk my coffee, fresh from\
  \ a thermos, in the shadow of a giant and ancient glacier. I had already seen the\
  \ Northern Lights, dancing above my head.\n\nWaiting at a bus stop, on the suburban\
  \ outskirts of Reykjavik, I was not expecting to have the most profound experience\
  \ of my trip to Iceland. I had already had that, countless times, out in the natural\
  \ world, beside waterfalls that roared louder than jet engines, that spat rainbows\
  \ into the sky like oil slicks. What I was expecting was a nice meal, a generous\
  \ invite from a familial acquaintance to share a dinner.\n\nOur host\u2019s house\
  \ was a large wooden bungalow. Inside it was welcoming, warm and wooden, bare footed,\
  \ softly lit. We quickly told our hosts how mesmerised we had been by the majesty\
  \ of their country\u2019s landscape, but to our embarrassment, they did not appreciate\
  \ our compliments. \n\nInstead they told us about a foreign family who had frozen\
  \ to death in their car, of two men sucked into the sea from being too close to\
  \ the waves. They argued for barriers at national parks and the removal of the free\
  \ camping law, which permits you to stay anywhere for a night, allowing you to fall\
  \ sleep next to glacier lakes, and wake up in the bowels of mountains. The easy\
  \ going infrastructure of the country's natural attractions was simply not suitable\
  \ for the reality of the current visitor numbers, they explained. They didn't want\
  \ to see a landscape marked by trash cans, but they didn't want to see it covered\
  \ in litter either. I had started the evening relishing in the freedom I had felt\
  \ in the country's open and feral landscape, the unregulated wilderness of it, and\
  \ by the end of it I was questioning the cost of that experience.\n\nAs a tourist\
  \ you hope that nothing changes in the places you plan to visit. We see the images,\
  \ of sulphurous ponds that explode like fireworks, of the free reign people seem\
  \ to have across these sites, and that is what we want to find when we arrive. Sharing\
  \ that meal reminded me that no land is severed from the people that live on it,\
  \ that even on a trip focused on the natural world, it is important to listen to\
  \ people as well as the wind. Though I had revelled in the raw intimacy of the countryside,\
  \ I left hoping that next time I might find fences, wooden stewards erected to protect\
  \ the land, to honour it by limiting access to it, to keep it safe for all who are\
  \ to come."
