Text: "My wandering journey had started on leap year day on the 29th of February 2016.\
  \ I had just got back from a 10-day Vipassana silent meditation a day earlier and\
  \ basically, I'd just packed all my belongings and selected the most important ones\
  \ for my backpack and put the rest of them into storage. I left my lovely room from\
  \ Commercial Drive, Vancouver, Canada. Moved out to look inwards and to let the\
  \ wind blow me where I was meant to be. I had many questions in life also wanted\
  \ to be responsibility free and meet interesting new people. Within a month I had\
  \ become a comfortable nomad traveler. Stayed at friends' places, looked after three\
  \ children while the parents were at the Caribbean\u2019s, slept outside as well,\
  \ at parks also on the beach watching the moon and the stars above me. Being spontaneous\
  \ and free had given me power and confidence. I was going wherever and doing whatever\
  \ I wanted. Very wild time of my life. I was making different directions and chose\
  \ traveling as my healing opportunity. Traveling always connects me to my instincts\
  \ and I feel my soul is alive and I am living my life to the full. \nOn an Easter\
  \ Monday I was heading to Pemberton, BC, to see my friend, Rosemarie. I met her\
  \ a few months earlier and she felt similar spirited like me. I surprised her with\
  \ my visit and found out she was on native reserve celebrating Easter Monday with\
  \ Frankie Jim and with his beautiful family. He is a highly respected man from the\
  \ Lillooet nation. I got a ride and the road to him was already wild and adventurous.\
  \ Just like him. His land blew my mind with its beauty and purity. I could bite\
  \ the air which was filled with love and so much joy. Suddenly, a sharp feeling\
  \ stroked me. This is it! I felt the connection, I felt divine energy brought me\
  \ here. Frankie\u2019s hospitality honored me, and his friendliness and open heart\
  \ attracted me. His horses grazed free, puppies jumped on me and children\u2019\
  s laughter reminded me that life is divine, and this is how we should live. My dream\
  \ that I had always wanted to meet Native Americans and experience their history\
  \ through their lives and stories, finally had become true. I was in the best place\
  \ to listen. I asked if I could camp on his land and he kindly offered me a room\
  \ in his house for as long as I needed. I felt home right away. This connection\
  \ had changed my life, and I was part of something I could barely comprehend. I\
  \ still visit him today and I am constantly learning through his lifestyle and his\
  \ stories."
