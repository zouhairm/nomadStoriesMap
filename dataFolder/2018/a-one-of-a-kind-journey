Text: "\u201CGet in the car!\u201D mum exclaimed. \n\nI can hear the panic rising\
  \ in her voice, as three men approaches us from the far end of the isolated Caledon\
  \ highway.  My hands shake in nervous terror, the reality of sitting behind locked\
  \ doors becoming unbearable.\n\n\u201CThere\u2019s no signal!\u201D Bonita mutters.\n\
  \nWe\u2019ve been trying to send out numerous texts to our Uncle but to no avail.\
  \ \n\n\u2018There\u2019s no cellular coverage\u201D, I echo hysterically. \n\nReaching\
  \ our destination at this point seems impossible as the signpost further down the\
  \ road indicates \u2018106 km to Swellendam via the N2\u2019. \n\n---\n\nOur departure\
  \ from home at 06:45 this morning was filled with excitement. Outside Mum, Bonita,\
  \ Andr\xE9 and I were met with the delight of a Summer\u2019s morning. It wasn\u2019\
  t long before the sun\u2019s influence doomed the cool air. The car radio added\
  \ to the excitement as we got onto the N2 on route to Swellendam approximately 240km\
  \ from Cape Town. We were over Sir Lowry\u2019s pass when a loud bang woke me from\
  \ a well-deserved nap.\n\n\u201CWhat was that?\u201D, Andr\xE9 exclaimed.\n\nA \
  \ cloud of grey smoke escaped from the front of the bonnet. After thorough inspection,\
  \ Andre declared the water tank burst \u2013 leaving our journey on a 30 minute\
  \ delay, we somehow managed to manoeuvre the tank in order to last for another 10km.\
  \ The clock strikes 10 am. \n\nWe stop at Grabouw, a small town located 66km south\
  \ east of Cape Town. Grabouw is known for its green forests that harvest fresh fruits.\
  \ For breakfast we head towards an eatery alongside Oak Avenue that offers a warm\
  \ ambience. The menu displays a country bistro type of culinary. The food ordered\
  \ was just the right therapy to face our next 10km.\n\nAfter numerous stops for\
  \ inspection, we enter Riviersonderend, a village 140 km outside Cape Town at 11:40;\
  \ the village displays beautiful scenes of serene lakes. We stop at a nearby garage,\
  \ to readjust our broken water tank. The scorching sun, by now, was out to leave\
  \ its mark on our skin. The one stop shop along the way, sells beautiful handcrafted\
  \ plates- the perfect gift for my aunt.\n\n---\n\nReminiscing on our earlier adventures\
  \ on the Western Cape route is now ruined with our current situation. The water\
  \ pipe broke beyond repair. We\u2019re now stuck between Caledon and Swellendam.\
  \ The three men are now in complete view. All of a sudden a familiar black car stops\
  \ beside us, I couldn\u2019t maintain my relief as my uncle steps out of the car.\
  \ \n\n\u201CIt\u2019s uncle Jerry!\u201D I shout.\n\n It was truly\u2026the last\
  \ thing I expected."
