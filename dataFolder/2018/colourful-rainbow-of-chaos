Text: "The yellow and green motorised tuk-tuk is moving in a rhythmical manner. An\
  \ auto rickshaw, or auto as the Indians call it. The three-wheeled covered moped\
  \ is fast and I am clinging on with both arms as the thought of falling out of the\
  \ Indian vehicle is a pretty scary and a rather embarrassing prospect. The chatty\
  \ moustache-clad driver is bobbing and weaving through the incredible volume of\
  \ people in the middle of Bangalore\u2019s city district with a Scandinavian London\
  \ inhabitant in the back. \u201CIs this your first time in Bengaluru madam?\u201D\
  \ he asks me. \u201CYes, first time in India actually\u201D I semi shout back to\
  \ my chauffeur hoping he can hear me whilst slalom-driving me through the city.\n\
  \ \nEarlier I had woken up in a rented hotel room in Koramangala before setting\
  \ off on a sleeper bus to lush Kerala a couple of days later, where slow moving\
  \ river boats awaited as well as colonial lodgings, the Arabian sea and much needed\
  \ calm. I opened the cream coloured curtains to be greeted by a sprawling city.\
  \ Chaotic and overcrowded with buildings and people. From my high up view, the city\
  \ appeared to be covered in a sheer grey filter. I took a deep breath. I had made\
  \ it to the country stretching from the mountainous Afghan frontier to the jungles\
  \ of Burma. Vast and diverse in terms of its people, cultural traditions and language.\
  \ \n\nWe pass the Musical Fountain in Vasanth Nagar and I am struck by the incandescent\
  \ shades of pinks, blues and greens which surround me. I close my eyes to take in\
  \ all the scents in the air. Cardamom, cumin and coriander mixed with heavy traffic\
  \ fumes are penetrating my nostrils. I open my eyes again and notice a whole family\
  \ overtaking us on a small red moped. With her bright pink saree, the mother looks\
  \ like she is riding a horse side-saddle in a period drama. Wedged between the two\
  \ grown-ups are two small children. The girl appears to be day dreaming and her\
  \ brother looks at me with sparkly eyes as we exchange a silent hello. \n\nSuddenly\
  \ the stresses of my every-day life are fading and I am starting to see clearly.\
  \ Every turn the auto takes is shaking sense into me. Inside I am screaming with\
  \ exhilaration, feeling totally content. We have reached our destination. My driver\
  \ has brought me to Malleshwaram West but really what this journey has brought me\
  \ is mindfulness, happiness and an inner calm which I never felt before. In this\
  \ colourful rainbow of chaos is where I found my pot of gold. This is the last thing\
  \ I expected. And I am forever grateful."
