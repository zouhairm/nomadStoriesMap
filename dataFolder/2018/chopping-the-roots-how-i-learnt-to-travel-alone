  . \n\nShe suspended the game and quickly got ready to start her job. As a naive\
  \ lone traveler, I was happy to have someone uncomplicated (as children generally\
  \ are) to walk me through. She began on once upon a time about the valiant King\
  \ Kumbha, who was a tall and strong man with abnormally long arms and had the resilience\
  \ to build a fort whose wall is the second longest only after the Great Wall of\
  \ China. Later, I heard of the conflicting competition to Kumbhalgarh, where the\
  \ Fort at Jaipur apparently had the second longest wall. I would not go into the\
  \ factual authenticity of which one stretched farther. I believed Payal when she\
  \ said it was a long wall, and that \n\n\u201CYou are forgetful.\u201D\n\n\u201C\
  Yes, apologies for that Payal.\u201D\n\nFor all my imperfection as a traveler, it\
  \ was a surprising when she voluntarily quipped, \n\n\u201CI found you friendly.\
  \ Would like to visit my home? It is right around the corner, over that mud-wall\u201D\
  . \n\nOne could either be skeptical and never have anything to talk about, or one\
  \ could have a curiosity which needs to be probed upon and have a bag full of stories\
  \ for their grandchildren. I took a chance notwithstanding I was in the middle of\
  \ nowhere. Kumbhalgarh is a scene in sepia where mountainous roads snake its way\
  \ through forests, with a lofty fort echoing of a distant past in folklores and\
  \ mystic fervour. I still remember that day clearly, as if I could touch it with\
  \ my fingertips if I manage to not blink for a long time. Payal\u2019s mother nursing\
  \ her newly born (another girl) child, her sea green cotton sari with the veil draped\
  \ over her head, the clinking of her glass bangles as she put her baby to sleep\
  \ under the cool shade of a tree, Payal\u2019s siblings running around, thrilled\
  \ at the prospect of a friendly visitor, and Payal wanting to click some photographs\
  \ of their pet cows with my camera, who were nonchalantly chewing the cud, unperturbed\
  \ by the recent development of events. I sat under the shade looking at the baby,\
  \ while my inhibitions slowly seemed to go away. \n\nMeeting my little travel guide\
  \ at Kumbhalgarh Fort taught me something that I can never bring myself to express\
  \ verbally. She opened me to the little surprises that travel can hold for you,\
  \ that moving out of your comfort zone and embracing uncertainty is not bad. I would\
  \ for life, be indebted to a child who taught me how to derestrict myself."
