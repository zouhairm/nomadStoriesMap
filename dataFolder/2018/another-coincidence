Text: "I\u2019m not like most people. From my six toes at birth, to a test stating\
  \ I have a personality only 10% of the population have, I\u2019ve always felt like\
  \ I didn\u2019t fit in. I\u2019ve always followed blindly to what I was told to\
  \ do, until I met Dilla. After a year of dating, against our family\u2019s wishes,\
  \ we decided to quit our jobs & spontaneously travel to another country. \n\nOn\
  \ our last Saturday in Argentina, after spending the evening eating empanadas, the\
  \ food coma that followed made us reluctant to go out, but I convinced Dilla anyways.\
  \ \n\nThe night was a bust. Not knowing anyone or the language limited us. A girl\
  \ that had bumped into me earlier in the night kept catching my attention, more\
  \ than the show being presented. One second she was with a group in front of us,\
  \ & the next she was with a group to the right of us. What an interesting creature\
  \ I mused. \n\nI felt bad for dragging Dilla out, neither of us were having fun.\
  \ I finally agreed that we should leave, \u201CBut let me say something to this\
  \ girl real quick\u201D I said, walking away before he could stop me. \n\n\u201C\
  Do you know everyone here?\u201D I asked her in my broken Spanish. Surely she must\
  \ have been someone that put the event together. She laughed at that idea, & said\
  \ no. I apologized & told her I didn\u2019t speak Spanish very well, to which she\
  \ exclaimed this was the workings of The Law of Attraction. I looked at her dumbfounded,\
  \ while she questioned who I came with. I introduced her to Dilla, & she told us\
  \ how she went out that night hoping to meet someone that spoke English. What a\
  \ coincidence I had stated. She laughed again, saying that there\u2019s no such\
  \ thing. \n\nWe ended up back at her place with a small group of people. This was\
  \ our first time being in a local\u2019s home, something I\u2019m positive most\
  \ tourist don\u2019t get to experience. She took us to her roof that had dazzling\
  \ sights, & was the first one to let us try mate, a traditional caffeinated drink.\
  \ We stayed up all night, conversing, playing music, laughing & relishing in the\
  \ moment. I started to feel like I belonged. \n\nTo this day I haven\u2019t met\
  \ anyone like Eugenia, in my country or in hers. We\u2019re still close & look forward\
  \ to being united again. We often joke about changing the world together, & laugh\
  \ about the many things we find we have in common. \n\nI don\u2019t really understand\
  \ The Law of Attraction, or why she says there\u2019s no such thing as a coincidence,\
  \ but it couldn\u2019t be by chance that we met. Or maybe I just got lucky finding\
  \ my best friend 6,104 miles away from home."
