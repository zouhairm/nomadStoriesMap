Text: "Mamdogo, her baby, Pita and me left Kiwele early, heading Muhanga to visit\
  \ the family. Later on, we got to the end of the paved road. No one goes further\
  \ unless on foot, by pikipiki (motorbike), 4x4 or rally car. And off we went in\
  \ an old sedan through a dirt track. It was narrow and full of sharp curves, slopes,\
  \ holes, bumps, stones, rocks and cliffs on the side. Besides, we took two ladies\
  \ who asked us for a ride.\nDuring steep or long uphills, I had to press hard on\
  \ the accelerator. Every now and then the passengers got off to relieve the weight.\
  \ After each obstacle, there was always another one. A couple of times the car needed\
  \ to be pushed. The tension was increasing and the danger kept making us company.\
  \ My teeth were clenched all the time. Once, all possible difficulties came together:\
  \ curve, uphill, mud, a car with no power anymore and a desperate driver. We, car\
  \ and driver, met our limits and stopped.\nThe ladies took their stuff and left.\
  \ We had to move the car from the way. So I went back to that damn seat, while Pita\
  \ and a couple of passers-by pushed the stuck-in-the-mud car. He arranged with the\
  \ owner of the only house around the price for keeping an eye on the car till our\
  \ coming back. Then, we started walking carrying our boxes and suitcases. A girl\
  \ appeared and tried to help us with the luggage. We were not going to reach Muhanga\
  \ with that load, so we called three pikipikis while kept walking until a crossing\
  \ with a sing pointing Muhanga. I was surprised to find that sing and happy for\
  \ our destination was nearby. We were surrounded by wooded lush mountains, sun,\
  \ wind and silence. The pikipikis arrived and we restarted the journey. It wasn\u2019\
  t so comfortable, but thrilling. \u201CDo you know you are supposed to minimise\
  \ your weight? You are too heavy\u201D, said the biker. I agreed with the gentleman\
  \ and laughed. He was a school teacher getting an extra income with the pikipiki.\n\
  As he stopped, some kids came around. Pita and Mamdogo with the baby attached by\
  \ a cloth arrived. A house on a way up, another one on a way down and one more house\
  \ on the opposite hill. We were in Muhanga. More people showed up. They were waiting\
  \ for us, as an extraordinary event. It\u2019s not likely to have a visitor from\
  \ Dar es Salaam, and even less likely to have a muzungu, i.e. white person. I was\
  \ told by gestures to take the way down. As soon as I stepped on that path I started\
  \ hearing some shouts. There were two ladies ululating! We didn\u2019t know each\
  \ other. We hugged. I was home."
