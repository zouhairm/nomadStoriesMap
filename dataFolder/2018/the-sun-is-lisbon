Text: "Lisbon spreads her arms until she is hugging the statue of Cristo Rei on the\
  \ opposite side of River Tejo. She is a huge hug to herself. I say \u201Cher\u201D\
  \ because she\u2019s more than a city, I do feel it. Lisbon is my partner, my lover\
  \ in this journey.\nLisbon is located on the river. Actually, this is just the final\
  \ part, the mouth, the outlet. Exactly here, it is meeting and mixing with the Ocean.\
  \ That\u2019s why the water becomes salty. So Lisbon owns sea, river, earth and\
  \ sky. She is the perfect result, the combination of all the elements that make\
  \ you feel alive.\nThe sun here is so big and the daylight so strong and powerful\
  \ that you can even absorb it. Therefore you get tanned so easily, just walking\
  \ through the streets, and your hair can even become blonder while your eyes must\
  \ close a little bit. Call it magic.\nAt the moment that I\u2019m writing it\u2019\
  s the 28th of January 2018, time 17:37 and the sky is still so bright, clear and\
  \ wide-open, preparing its next breath-taking sunset. Lisbon is the city of sunsets,\
  \ or better of P\xF4res-do-sol. In Italian we are used to say: \u201CRosso di sera,\
  \ bel tempo si spera\u201D; when the sky turns red at the sunset, you may expect\
  \ for good weather the next day. This happens here everyday, almost. We check the\
  \ correct time on the forecast online when the sun goes down, when falls in the\
  \ river or in the Ocean, it depends on the point of view. We all go to one of the\
  \ hundreds Miradouros, we seat and we breathe the end of the day. And when the sun\
  \ disapperas behind the horizon, everyone starts clapping hands. \nIn Lisbon I\u2019\
  ve learned that you can reach anything you want, which I learnt it because I always\
  \ prefer to walk instead of taking the metro. Every street is a climb and when you\
  \ reach the top the city gives you a panorama most of the times. \nI arrived here\
  \ in September for my Erasmus interchange programme and I am already leaving next\
  \ Tuesady. I must be honest: I didn\u2019t want to come to Lisbon. Or better, I\
  \ didn\u2019t know so much about Portugal and its capital. Portuguese people maybe\
  \ still try to live in their peaceful paradise, a little bit out of the world, believing\
  \ in traditions and blessed by their sun. So everything was a surprise, and it was\
  \ by chance. I am so grateful now- OBRIGADA- to be here, surrounded by all this\
  \ sunshine, and discovering day by day something that for me was more than unknown.\
  \ And tomorrow I am getting my second travel tattoo, and I will write on my skin\
  \ that OBRIGADA."
