Text: "Reggaeton takes me to a mind space where I must dance. I imagine myself as\
  \ a sexy se\xF1orita throwing some shapes rhythmically in a club somewhere in Puerto\
  \ Rico or Cuba. The reality of my dancing and my locale, in recent years has been\
  \ different! Anyhow, when in Rome and the possibility of seeing one of my Reggaeton\
  \ icons in concert arose the opportunity was too tempting to miss. I had to venture\
  \ to an unfamiliar 'barrio', as the Spanish would say, on the outskirts to see my\
  \ icon. I was apprehensive about the journey there. \n\nGetting to the concert,\
  \ in the end, was easy. I danced the night away and was then was faced with getting\
  \ home. I ventured to a metro station and it became clear that the last metro had\
  \ gone. So I took to the road. I made my way to a bus stop and waited for a bus.\
  \ After a while I tried speaking to a girl there but she couldn\u2019t help me as\
  \ she \"no hablo ingles\". I then walked around to see if I could find any taxis\
  \ or other bus stops that would lead me back to Rome. \n\nAfter walking many blocks\
  \ in a state of panic I resigned myself to sitting on a pavement at the edge of\
  \ a bus stop as my feet couldn\u2019t take anymore standing. It was a sad state\
  \ of affairs. The roads were dead. No metro, no bus, no taxi. I completely regretted\
  \ going to the concert. \n\nTen minutes went by and a BMW pulled up, gestured for\
  \ me to get in the back and said something to me in Italian. I thought to myself\
  \ that this was strange. It became apparent after a while that he thought I was\
  \ a hooker! I was gobsmacked. I thought to myself I can\u2019t look like a hooker;\
  \ I\u2019m wearing normal people clothes. I managed to shoo him off. I thought it\
  \ was then over but he returned to try the same again!\n\nSanctuary was found when\
  \ a taxi went by and provided a ride back to my hostel. We drove through the placid\
  \ darkness of the suburbs. It was a horrible place and it will continue to be a\
  \ horrible place in my memory. On the road back to Rome I saw actual prostitutes\
  \ in bus stops. I couldn\u2019t believe my eyes. I was innocently waiting for a\
  \ bus - I thought! It hit home the trouble I could have got myself into when I saw\
  \ these women. For a while I sobbed. I thought I never want to go travelling alone\
  \ again. These thoughts were temporary though and so I picked myself up and returned\
  \ to the realisation that if I want to do something it is me that must put one foot\
  \ in front of the other to make things happen. Nobody else. After a while longer\
  \ in the taxi I saw the hostel sign and I was home."
