Text: "\"Here comes Steph with her big Nungas,\" my friend teased and laughed. I rolled\
  \ my eyes but clutched my school uniform close over my chest. I was embarrassed,\
  \ but not offended. After all, every single one of us was uncomfortable with our\
  \ bodies at that age. \n\"Don't be jealous,\" I answered as I sat down. \"Go on\
  \ and take 'em in. I know you'll miss them since you'll be going back out to the\
  \ bush soon.\" \nMarsha was a boarder at my private college, a secondary school\
  \ in the middle outback Australia. Where I was an American intruder here because\
  \ of dad's job, she was aborigine and a true native with broad shoulders and skin\
  \ as dark as crocodile eyes. \nShe smiled with a similar toothy grin, but in shared\
  \ laughter rather than vicious intent to swallow me. \"Yeah, I guess so. I admit,\
  \ I'll miss lunch hour while I'm gone.\"\n\"You could stay with me during break,\"\
  \ I offered.\n\"Nah,\" she said. \"I want to see my grandma. She has the best memory\
  \ of the Dreamtime.\" \nI tilted my head at her. \"The what?\"\nShe scooted closer\
  \ to me, light in her eyes brighter than the milky way in summer. \"The Dreamtime.\
  \ It's like stories about aborigines and how Australia was made and stuff.\" \n\"\
  So,\" I mulled it over for a moment, \"is it like a religion?\" \nShe pursed her\
  \ lips. \"Not really. It's different from the prayers and Sunday service. It's just\
  \ stories, but we don't have a book or nothin'. My grandma just tells us about the\
  \ first aborigines, and about how the mountain ranges are sleeping caterpillars\
  \ that will wake up one day and move elsewhere. And about the sisters who became\
  \ stars.\" She stopped and looked at me, \"and I'll know all the stories too one\
  \ day, and I'll become the grandma who tells all the stories.\" \nA pang pulled\
  \ at my chest, and it took a minute to realize it was jealousy. Marsha had a shared\
  \ history, a family that could tell her about their past. She could trace her people\
  \ to the very first footprints in the red sand, and convince herself that if a man\
  \ of her tribe could outwit a snake, then she could graduate.  \nI had been raised\
  \ by a popular printed book with strict laws of what I can and can't do, and what\
  \ was expected of me. She had been raised with shadow puppets on the ghost gum trees\
  \ and the laws for her people written in the milky way. \n\"Can you tell me some?\"\
  \ I asked, desperate to be part of her history. \"Stories of the Dreamtime, I mean.\"\
  \ \nShe smiled and packed up the trash from her lunch. \"Sure,\" she said. \"That's\
  \ the whole point of them isn't? To be shared.\""
