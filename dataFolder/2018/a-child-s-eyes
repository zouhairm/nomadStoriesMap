Text: "\"Sawadee ka,\" she shouted, with a bright smile washed across her filthy,\
  \ yet youthful skin. I returned greetings with my rough and trying speech. \"I\u2019\
  m a teacher,\" I say, \"in a place called Canada. I teach children just like you.\"\
  \ Her eyes widen and sadden simultaneously. \"We don\u2019t have school,\" she speaks\
  \ in her broken English, \"but my brother teaches me when he is home.\" I hand her\
  \ a box of crayolas with names of colours she cannot read \u2013 mahogany, burnt\
  \ orange, sunglow, jungle green, hot magenta and cerulean. Strikingly similar to\
  \ the hues of the Chaing Rai sky, lush canopy trees and blue waters, as if I could\
  \ pencil them in right around us.\n\nShe teaches me how to make priceless toys,\
  \ play with sticks, Lahu dance, peel unfamiliar fruits so I don\u2019t look silly\
  \ and how to make ample rice dishes, penetrated with spices. We spend the days singing\
  \ and dancing, eating and colouring, sharing and learning from each other.\n\nWhile\
  \ telling stories and eating rambutan on the earthen floor of her family\u2019s\
  \ single, bamboo cabin, she assaults my long blonde hair with her sticky fingers.\
  \ I don\u2019t mind because I now know showers are a luxury. I\u2019ll wash it out\
  \ at the hilltribe's favoured waterfall down the way.  We slurp the juices between\
  \ words and throw the scraps to the strays and swine that scavenge for leavings\
  \ at the entrance.\n\nShe hands me a bracelet, with colourful beads and little silver\
  \ elephants that dangle as I move. \"Gui,\" I ask, \"why are you giving me this?\"\
  \ I think of how little she has. \"Because I don\u2019t need it,\" she smiles. The\
  \ difference between a need and a want punches me in the gut. She has never lived\
  \ with extras. I try to force 500 baht into her mother's calloused hands, as if\
  \ money is the answer to everything. They would not take it. \"Kob Khun Kha,\" I\
  \ utter and that is enough.\n\nPlaced around my wrist, I suddenly became thankful\
  \ for my feet to jump in puddles left behind from monsoon rains, my hands to play\
  \ with stick swords, my imagination to look beyond clouds, my eyes to see the colours,\
  \ my ears to listen to stories, my mouth to taste the spices, my nose to smell the\
  \ aromas \u2013 to feel immensely grateful, through a child\u2019s eyes, on the\
  \ other side of the world.\n\nBack home, I gather my students as they unknowingly\
  \ take advantage of our four walls and fancy new classroom Chromebooks. A seven-year-old\
  \ fingers my bracelet and asks me where it\u2019s from. I tell her. \"It\u2019s\
  \ so pretty,\" she says, \"are they rich?\" I nod, \"yes, they\u2019re much richer\
  \ than us.\""
