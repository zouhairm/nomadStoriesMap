Text: "Havana, Cuba. Retro cars in dazzling blues and rumpus reds sail by beaches\
  \ filled with fat tourists. There are Plymouths and Ford Fairlane\u2019s aplenty.\
  \ Jazz musicians from the Buena Vista Social Club play a melody which could soothe\
  \ the soul of a Guantanamo Bay inmate. It is Guantanamera, the old tune about a\
  \ truthful man who coins the verses of his life before dying in the land of the\
  \ palms. Who wouldn\u2019t want to? It is paradise. Idyllic, cloudless weather.\
  \ Cobbled calles filled with the clip clop of horses. The old abuelo taking a siesta\
  \ under the shady palm blowing a puff of Cohiba silently. He winks at you, or more\
  \ likely, at the twenty-something brunette behind you, as she rushes home for cena\
  \ with the extended family. Turning the corner you reach Plaza Vieja where a fountain\
  \ bubbles. Children in uniform bicker and becker. Crossing the street you pass by\
  \ Hotel Inglaterra, a suave spot where lunch is served on silver platters. \n\n\
  Stop.\n\n Beyond the fa\xE7ade of the idyllic island paradise is a whole new world.\
  \ Dilapidated houses. Thirsty people. Ninety miles away fresh water comes out at\
  \ the effortless turn of a tap. Here it must be sourced, boiled, chlorine added,\
  \ filtered and finally poured into a mouth thirsty for change. What would I know\
  \ about change in Cuba? I was only there for fifteen days. True. In that time however\
  \ I had opportunity to connect with the locals. My method was simple. After chatting\
  \ for a while I would simply say, \u2018Obama?\u2019 and then give a thumbs up and\
  \ a thumbs down - just as the Roman emperor\u2019s once did to spare or end a weary\
  \ gladiator\u2019s life. I never got a thumbs down. Not once. This is big. For the\
  \ past fifty-seven years the US has imposed a trade embargo on the island. Now,\
  \ thumbs are up here and there and everywhere. \n\nImagine a class of third graders\
  \ at a primary school. Instead of kids however, there are adults who are ready to\
  \ face the world sitting awkwardly in those silly school seats. They are overgrown,\
  \ yet restricted from leaving the classroom or progressing to the next grade. That\u2019\
  s how Cubans feel. Don\u2019t get me wrong, Communism was a good school master in\
  \ some ways. It has taught the people patience. They know how to queue for food,\
  \ for rations, for buses. They even now know how to queue for life. But now the\
  \ queue is getting edgy. Frisky as a tom cat. And it\u2019s not like they're demanding\
  \ liberal democratic capitalism. No, they just want a cup of clean water."
