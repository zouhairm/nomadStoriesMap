Text: "This green eyed man stood resolute with a deformed left hand but his right\
  \ one restlessly jolting small glass \u2018pyala\u2019 in the water bath; came and\
  \ sat on the table next to me. His  movements felt out of place in this small rural\
  \ South Indian breakfast shack. Broad nose and a checkered ragged shirt with a few\
  \ buttons missing, somehow covered him and an old tattoo of lord \u2018Shiva\u2019\
  \ with \u2018Om\u2019 inscribed quiet evidently on his chest. Wristlets of rosary\
  \ tangled and winded his thin wrist while sporting a silver locket on his neck.\
  \ He reached out to a leather pouch searching meticulously. To my surprise he pulled\
  \ out an old Japanese to Hindi traveler\u2019s language guide and started reading\
  \ it attentively. \nThe site was among least of my expectations on this trip of\
  \ Hampi. Once the heart of ancient Vijayanagara empire, it used to be the largest\
  \ city after Beijing during the medieval-era, attracting traders from Persia to\
  \ Europe. Now the UNESCO world heritage site is a playground for amature free climbers,\
  \ a seared landscape scattered with boulders and ruins of the ancient empire baking\
  \ under the sun. Long winding lonely roads and these rocks tower over them overshadowing\
  \ it all. As if willing to fall apart crumbling any moment, this excites one's heart\
  \ in an uneasy yet pleasing manner. Contrasting to all of this, endless paddy fields\
  \ with coconut trees scarcely dotting the foreground hinting at man\u2019s success\
  \ over this rugged terrain. \nIn the midst of it all was this oriental eyed man,\
  \ far from his home selling tea by the banks of Tungabhadra river.\n I walked up\
  \ to him politely asking to join in and he greeted with a subtle smile. \u2018You\
  \ have been travelling for quite a while?\u2019 I asked. With a bizarre japanese\
  \ accent he replied describing the  places he saw, from the monasteries of Dharamshala\
  \ to the quiet beache of Agonda Goa, exploring and experiencing catharsis, sustaining\
  \ through all hardship, doing odd jobs to feed himself on the go. \u201CKosuke Kobayashi\
  \ from Osaka\u2019\u2019 he muttered. A 43 year old ex-engineer who gave up his\
  \ wife, two children and his social stature back home for the life on road here\
  \ in India. Few weeks in this small quiet place retrospecting it all during the\
  \ twilite of this epic journey, I saw the satisfaction peeping through his eyes\
  \ as we concluded  parting our own ways, but the last expressions on his face assured\
  \ me what a bliss it is, in this surreal place, its people, temples and food. All\
  \ of this leaves a traveller spellbound and lost for good."
