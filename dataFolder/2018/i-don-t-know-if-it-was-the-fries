Text: "Sitting out on the outdoor balcony of the little Irish Pub that we found on\
  \ the main street in Breckenridge, Colorado, I could feel the temperature dropping\
  \ just as fast as the sun seemed to be. I would have done anything to have the sun\
  \ stay out just a few hours longer to make this day last. But the time was going\
  \ and so were all the beers my dad, his friends and some locals that joined us were\
  \ chugging down at the table. Twelve of us, all sitting around a little metal woven\
  \ table meant for about half as many, all our legs beginning to take the impressions\
  \ in of the matching chairs that when knew would hurt when we finally peeled ourselves\
  \ off of them. Most of us just have meet each other. \nI finally noticed out waitress\
  \ standing patiently by the table, waiting for our laughter to quite down enough\
  \ so she could be heard when she asked \u201CDoes anyone want another drink or a\
  \ refill on fries?\u201D The question not even out of her mouth yet before they\
  \ all started to reply with what drinks they wanted next. I looked at her when she\
  \ had written them all down and ordered another order of fries. And to this day\
  \ I don\u2019t know if it was the fries or the place, just being around everyone,\
  \ laughing and telling stories like we were around a camp fire, but man, those fries\
  \ were the best darn fries I\u2019ve ever eaten in my life. She couldn\u2019t bring\
  \ them out fast enough, half of them were gone before the basket hit the table.\
  \ She just laughed and said \u201CI\u2019ll go ahead and bring a couple more orders\
  \ of those out.\u201D \nAfter she left I didn\u2019t see her again, although I know\
  \ sure came back several times because drinks kept refilling and we didn\u2019t\
  \ run out of fires again. But we had made our own world right there, no doubt that\
  \ the people walking by on the street below were wondering what was going on with\
  \ all the yelling and laughing we were doing. Before we knew it, it was almost closing\
  \ time and we had forgotten that we had all just meet each other earlier that day.\
  \ As we got our things together and our checks paid before we went our seperate\
  \ ways back to where we were sleeping, two of the men broke out in song. The next\
  \ thing I knew we were all singing at the tops of out lungs \u201CStand By Me\u201D\
  , not very good but that didn\u2019t matter. We all knew that we had made new friends\
  \ and that this place was special. On the car ride back to our hotel, I couldn\u2019\
  t help but smile about everything that just happened and be excited for what was\
  \ in store for us tomorrow."
