Text: For me, travelling is a feeling. Its that sense of excitement at the commencement
  of a journey wherein you know that all your dreams and aspirations about visiting
  a place becomes a reality. Its the adventures where you find yourself lost in the
  jungle during a trek, or the excitement when you stand on the surfing board for
  the first time, or finding yourself amazed at knowing that you can play a flute.
  Its the warmth of a campfire and the sweetness of roasted s'mores. Its learning
  how to jive under the stars or singing till your voice is gone. Travelling is the
  people you encounter in journey, from smoking cigarettes in a cold winter night
  with Israeli hipsters or dancing in shady bars with strangers who become your best
  friends. Its that sensation where you make it to the top of a mountain and realise
  that you did not simply conquer just the mountain but your deepest fears too. Travelling
  for me is the unexpected, discovering yourself along with a place. Its looking out
  onto the horizon and actually tasting a sense of freedom. It is the stories that
  go beyond your wildest imagination and its the realisation that you could become
  everything that you wanted to be and more.
