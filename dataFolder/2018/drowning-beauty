Text: "This was my first trip to Baia di Ieranto, a well-hidden little piece of paradise\
  \ in Italy. I had some friends doing their voluntary service here. Since I was doing\
  \ mine in Naples, it was only a matter of time to finally visit them. \nAs I eased\
  \ myself down into the water, trying not to bother the fish moving around lazily\
  \ under me but they didn\u2019t seem to mind me at all. They didn't realise I was\
  \ to conquer one of my biggest fears. I'm sure they could hear the rapid rhythm\
  \ of my heart. Even the otherwise comfortable temperature of the water seemed to\
  \ be colder now. \nWe were in the shadow of a smaller cave. There was a tiny tunnel\
  \ that led to its exit. I've been told that when the water level was low enough,\
  \ you could easily go through with your face in the water. This time the water level\
  \ was high enough to cover the last 3 meters of the tunnel so we had to swim through\
  \ holding our breaths. I haven't been afraid of drowning since I was a kid but that\
  \ really pushed my limits. \nMy friend was ready to escort me through. Before putting\
  \ my face into the water, I already saw a mingling crowd of fish, in all colours\
  \ of the rainbow, moving around in the pile of big white rocks. \nAs I put my face\
  \ in the water, it was as if I stepped through a TV screen, right into the live\
  \ show. All the colours intensified. My heart was beating like a wild little bird\
  \ with its wings trapped in the hands of a kid. I was so scared but so certain at\
  \ the same time. I knew I was going to do it. \nMy friend went first. Then, after\
  \ some waiting, it was finally my turn. I draw a big breath before throwing my head\
  \ down into the glimmering colours, pushing myself forward with the flippers. I\
  \ had a heat of energy run through me, something wild. I must have been smiling\
  \ for sure as I got a glance of the scattered fish down under. \nThen the next push\
  \ of wave came and forced me to the rocky ceiling, making me spit all the air out\
  \ of my lungs. I started to fin in an insane rhythm with all my force, going face\
  \ towards the sunshine. I was afraid the reflex to draw a breath would come too\
  \ soon, only to fill my lungs with water. I was just pushing and pushing, concentrating\
  \ on the light above the surface, already looking for my two friends. \nWhen I finally\
  \ broke through their faces said it all. I took longer than I should have. They\
  \ were worried. I was terrified; and smiling. I did it. Before, I thought of myself\
  \ as a weak person. Now, I knew better - and intended to do much more."
