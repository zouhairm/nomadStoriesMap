Text: "The barefoot toddler wearing a goat skin loincloth decorated with feathers\
  \ waddles towards me with her plump little arms outstretched, begging to be picked\
  \ up.  Her velvety chocolate skin and shaved head with a single braid curled on\
  \ her forehead is slathered with some kind of red clay that will surely leave stains\
  \ on my beige tank top and shorts.  But she's too adorable to resist!\n\nMy visit\
  \ to her Himba village in northern Namibia is a treat, since it's the first tribe\
  \ I've seen in the two weeks that I've been on a small group tour in this country.\
  \  The Himbas are one of a handful of African tribes still trying to live the way\
  \ of their ancestors.\n\nWalking around here, it's like a scene from National Geographic.\
  \  Huts made of mud and cow dung. Boobs in full view.\n\nBut modern trappings of\
  \ the outside world are making it difficult for youngsters, like the one I'm holding,\
  \ to choose staying in the village.  \n\nAs she squirms in my arms touching my face\
  \ and hair, our Himba guide tells us his people are nomadic goat and cow herders\
  \ living in isolated desert areas.  The distinctive red clay mixture of clarified\
  \ butter (ghee), red ochre rock powder, and herbs is worn as a symbol of beauty\
  \ by all Himba females and distinguishes them from other tribes.  \n\nThe Himba\
  \ women also spend hours braiding their elaborate hair extensions.  These Rastafarian-style\
  \ extensions can be woven from goat hair, hay, or sometimes the women go into town\
  \ to purchase east Indian hair extensions, just like those the Kardashians might\
  \ wear!  \n\nThat's just one encroachment of modernity.  So are the numerous tourist\
  \ buses that unload daily to glimpse this primitive way of life.  Inviting in tourists\
  \ gives the tribe much needed supplemental income.  However, this also means young\
  \ Himbas are getting constant exposure to the visitor's cameras, iPhones and Western\
  \ dress-- reminding them there's an outside world that has passed them by.  \n\n\
  Life is hard in the village.  Girls have babies as young as ten.  More and more\
  \ tribesmen are trying to get jobs in town.  But with little education few succeed,\
  \ becoming disillusioned or exposed to alcohol and other wayward temptations of\
  \ city life.\n\nThe Namibian government wants these children to attend school and\
  \ learn to function in modern society.  Outsiders lament and romanticize this disappearing\
  \ way of life.  But I hope the little girl in the loincloth I've come to adore,\
  \ gets the choice to live outside this fishbowl if that's what her future holds."
