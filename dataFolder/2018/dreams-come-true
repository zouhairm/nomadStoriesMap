Text: "Dreams come true\n\n\u201CI am a Dreamer and I am not the only on\u0435\u201D\
  , I guess one of the most inspiring quote of all times.\n\nImagine you are high\
  \ schooler dreaming about traveling a country, passionate and impulsive land of\
  \ Flamenco dancers -Spain. I promised myself to earn this Dream Trip in future.\
  \ I was picturing myself in the streets of Barcelona, hearing Spanish phrases and\
  \ being a part of this dynamic spirit of one the most beautiful cities in the world.\
  \ So, here I am, 10 years after, standing in the heart of vibrant city Barcelona!\
  \ \n\nWhat is so magnetizing about this city? You can tell it right away while landing\
  \ on a board of a plane, when spectacular city aerial view with its unique architecture\
  \ is metaphorically welcoming you: \u201CMi casa es su casa\u201D \u2013 \u201C\
  My home is your home!\u201D.  \nMiddle-October, when high season was almost over\
  \ and the weather was friendly enough to have a long walking tours around the city\
  \ without getting exhausted of the heat. Walking in the streets, you realize that\
  \ Barcelona is melting pot for people with different cultural backgrounds, where\
  \ you can feel absolutely comfortable. \n\nTo see the real face of Barcelona and\
  \ feel the connection with local people we decided to go to local music festival.\
  \ Here in public place, you recognize the voice of Barcelona. People are speaking\
  \ in a vivid and expressive manner, but I believe this is in the blood of Spanish\
  \ people to demonstrate their passionate personality. Music really connects people,\
  \ even if you don\u2019t know the language you can feel the rhythm, dance it and\
  \ share your inner world, especially in the crowd of passionate people.  \n\nMaking\
  \ a spiritual connection is one the most intriguing thing in traveling. If you have\
  \ ever had any creative or emotional crisis, Barcelona is the best place to recover\
  \ and feed your mind with original ideas.This city is famous for its spectacular\
  \ art of Antonio Gaudi, which you will intuitively be able to identify in the city\
  \ landsape. His unique buildings will definitely inspire you during the trip.\n\n\
  Being an experienced traveler, I always try to understand local people first, since\
  \ they are true reflection of the city itself, its spirit and culture. In general,\
  \ Barcelona has very friendly and warm people. It was a lifetime experience to get\
  \ to know Barcelona from inside and be inspired by its freedom - loving spirit.\
  \ Always remember that,\u201CThe Future Belongs to those who believe in the Beauty\
  \ of their Dreams\u201D by Eleanor Roosevelt."
