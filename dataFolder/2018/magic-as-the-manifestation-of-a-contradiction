Text: "There is a strange sculpture on the beach in Vik, on the southern shore of\
  \ Iceland: a naked man standing in a column of basalt, motionless, staring at the\
  \ ocean. It is a straight, tall structure, dedicated to the fishermen and the people\
  \ who lost their lives in the northern sea. The statue is tearing across the landscape\
  \ like a stab. Its name is \u201CF\xF6r\u201D (Fair) \u2013in Icelandic, the word\
  \ means \u201Cjourney\u201D-, and is an artwork from the artist Steinunn Thorarinsdottir.\
  \ \n\nOn my way to south shore, I travel through a lunar landscape. Iceland is a\
  \ country with very few buildings and trees. The streets are almost empty, surrendered\
  \ to the ice, like white sandy deserts. There are geothermic pools here and there;\
  \ I can see the lonely path of their steam heading to the sky. The sea can be seen\
  \ in the background, together with the gigantic shadows of the extinguished volcanoes\
  \ of the ocean. \n\nThat sculpture of Vik, brings me to mind the \"Tomb of the Diver\"\
  , a famous fresco (5th century BC.) currently at the Museum of Paestum. I remember\
  \ having seen an image of that fresco in a book, with the phrase \"the fall as an\
  \ allegory of death\" underneath.\n\nThe diver scene has been interpreted in various\
  \ ways. \u201CDeath and diving were connected in the Greek mind. It is suggested\
  \ that the dive is meant to depict the moment of death: the diver dives alone, isolated\
  \ against the sky. There is present all the intensity of the moment of death\u201D\
  \n\n\u0391n icy wind is suddenly blowing, the weather conditions here can be extreme;\
  \ the cold is immobilizing parts of my body, secret internal processes are mobilized,\
  \ the night is coming, darkness will envelop the landscape in an unfamiliar silence,\
  \ it will reveal it all back again all renewed, under another light.\n\nAt the opposite\
  \ end of the ocean, in the UK, at the small community of Hull, this very moment,\
  \ a twin \u201Cdiver \u2013 sculpture\u201D, named \u201CVoyage\u201D is looking\
  \ at the same sea -from the other side. In an imaginary straight line the eyes of\
  \ the statues -as the eyes of the dead-, would somewhere meet. \n\nAt the middle\
  \ of the ocean.\n\nAs I am getting ready to take the way back home a photography\
  \ workshop approaches the beach. They are here to cover a wedding. The bride is\
  \ dressed in white. The sand, the rocks, and the background \u2013 everything around\
  \ her- is totally black. \n\nThat was the last thing I expected: a white wildflower\
  \ in a dark desert. sea \n\nMaybe magic becomes alive only in harsh contradictions\
  \ - it is the manifestation of a contradiction itself."
