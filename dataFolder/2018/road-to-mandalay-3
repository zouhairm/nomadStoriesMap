Text: "It is 4am, air is cold, the whole train wagon is dark. Ordinary class is full\
  \ of unknown, smell of sleepiness, and strangers that I share no language with.\
  \ Train moves forward, slow and bumpy ride sets the rhythm of this unusual country.\n\
  \nBack in 2014, when I visited Myanmar, it was still a country untouched by the\
  \ modern tech inventions. Regular people did not have phones, debit cards, most\
  \ of them have never seen a computer or used internet. The country has recently\
  \ opened up to foreigners, who started to come and admire this strange, strange\
  \ land. Land where women\u2019s face is painted with thanaka - yellow powder paint\
  \ made from a tree bark, land where man wear  lungyi - long colourful skirts.  \n\
  \nMyanmar has been through so much, oppressive military regime, harsh life conditions,\
  \ yet the people find a way how to go on, find some kind of inner peace and most\
  \ of all, keep a very kind heart.  \n\nI sit down on a small wooden bench next to\
  \ an old wrinkled grandma. She takes her tiny wrinkled hand and places it on my\
  \ left tight. Her touch is very gentle, and to be honest at this point I am not\
  \ sure the hand is even there. Then I look down to check and yes, it is there. I\
  \ feel confused. Being brought up in an environment where keeping personal space\
  \ is a big deal, I feel   far beyond my comfort zone. I look into her eyes and she\
  \ gives me the warmest smile, with shining clarity in her eyes that look right at\
  \ me. I get so embarrassed by such an unexpected moment of intimacy, that I look\
  \ away and try not to cry, as my throat becomes tensed and my heart melts a bit.\
  \ After some time she offers me a bag of rice to use as a pillow. \n\nUnfortunately,\
  \ I have not yet mastered the national sports of Myanmar aka \u201Cthe art of sleeping\
  \ anywhere\u201D, so I need to return this gift. She offers me her own knee to use\
  \ as a pillow. As touching as this gesture is, I am not that compact. Old wrinkled\
  \ grandma stands up, pulls out an empty bag of rice, spreads it on the floor, and\
  \ falls sound asleep, beautifully ignoring all the people passing through and around\
  \ her in the train aisle. \n\nWhat I have learned on that train, is how important\
  \ and how easy it is, to connect with person next to you. I don\u2019t want to forget\
  \ to look into the eyes of strangers, I don\u2019t want to fear smiling and being\
  \ curious about others. Even when we don\u2019t share a single word in a common.\
  \ \n\nI don\u2019t want to forget that 4am cold air full of humanness hiding in\
  \ a dark wagon on a road to Mandalay."
