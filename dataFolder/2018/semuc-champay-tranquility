Text: "When I first arrived at peak of the mountainous gorge little did I know that\
  \ the next 2 hour vibrant van ride down the tough terrain to the small town of Semuc\
  \ Champay would leave me in such awe. Nestled at the base of a gully the only way\
  \ in is in the back of not so promising Toyota van until you can no longer rely\
  \ on a rear wheeled driven vehicle to take you any further. We unload our packs\
  \ from the back of the van at our designated meeting point, halfway down the mountain,\
  \ our non English speaking driver splutters a sentence we can kind of make out,\
  \ we must wait for a 4wd to take us the remainder of the trip to the village. It\u2019\
  s a short wait, our 4wd looks tough and ready for the rest of the trek. We sit on\
  \ timber bench seats in the back of a roofless 4wd ute. As we make our way toward\
  \ our destination I can\u2019t help but take in the surrounding jungle and let my\
  \ imagination run wild with what tales it must have hidden. Our 4wd adventure comes\
  \ to an end, it\u2019s bitter sweet, on one hand the beauty of my surroundings wanted\
  \ the journey to last forever, on the other, my buttocks were aching for the drive\
  \ to end as quickly as possible. Our home for the next 4 days is a small timber\
  \ bungalow compete with woven flora as the roof. The village has no power nor any\
  \ running water. At first I\u2019m apprehensive about staying, for someone so used\
  \ to the digital world and lifestyle, the thoughts of not being able to enjoy the\
  \ luxuries of simply plugging my phone in to charge or going for a shower run through\
  \ my mind, I tell myself to let go and dive head first into the world of detachment\
  \ from modern civilisation. We\u2019re 40 feet from a beautiful running fresh water\
  \ creek, where we\u2019Re free to bath and wash our belongings as required. This\
  \ is all new to me, something so unique to me is everyday life for the people living\
  \ and working in our small retreat. I let myself go of what I know. I grab the thought\
  \ of living off the grid eagerly with both hands. It\u2019s therapeutic, it brings\
  \ you back down to the reality of the real world, the rawness of life, the beauty\
  \ of Mother Nature. If you\u2019re ready and willing, I urge you to experience this\
  \ beauty yourself, Semuc Champay, a world away, living life simply day by day."
