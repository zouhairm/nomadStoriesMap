Text: "The pungent smell of dung brimmed the surrounding air in such a way that it\
  \ lingered with every step and hung onto the threads on one\u2019s body. Its intensity\
  \ was owing to the humidity that draped this city of Bangladesh; Sylhet. This was\
  \ a sensation I was not accustomed to but was slowly learning to embrace. \nMy travels\
  \ to this country stemmed from the curiosity of discovering my cultural heritage.\
  \ With this in mind I held my anxious thoughts at bay, as I approached my mother\u2019\
  s pre-marital home. The red brick structure canvassed the length of the land. I\
  \ was greeted by a host of unfamiliar faces sheltering under the veranda. Words\
  \ of Bengali descent were hauled at me from every direction causing me to resemble\
  \ the wiper blades of a car in the season of torrential rain. Grasping some words,\
  \ I entered the threshold to a minimalistic d\xE9cor. The walls were blank white\
  \ canvases encompassing the stark necessities, namely a table, bed and a few kitchen\
  \ appliances. The modern, technological commodities I was habituated to, ceased\
  \ to exist. \nWith the heat licking my flushed cheeks and the ground beneath me\
  \ smouldering, I held a certain level of uncertainty as to what my culture has to\
  \ offer. \nThe crowd soon dispersed, but shortly after I was joined by a girl not\
  \ much younger than me, whose russet cheeks revealed the magnitude of the heat she\
  \ endured.  To my surprise she spoke in the dialect of Bengali that I can adequately\
  \ speak and as such a conversation ensued with a combination of English and Bengali\
  \ sentences being strung together. \nAisha, she introduced herself as. My cousin.\
  \ I asked her where she had been and why she was burning. This time was considered\
  \ the hottest time of the day when most people take comfort in the shade. She responded\
  \ that she had finished class for that day and had walked home. The walking distance\
  \ totals to just over an hour. In order to reach the school in the mornings, it\
  \ was necessary to leave at 6am especially to avoid the scalding heat. She proceeded\
  \ to make dinner with other family members, inviting me along to experience cooking\
  \ authentic Bengali food. All the while when she spoke of her life, she made no\
  \ complaints and conveyed everything in a positive manner. \nIn that moment, the\
  \ culture I came searching for became visibly clear. In the midst of adversity,\
  \ this community upheld their appreciation of life, finding happiness in the simplest\
  \ of things. So often we take things for granted, when more often we need to appreciate."
