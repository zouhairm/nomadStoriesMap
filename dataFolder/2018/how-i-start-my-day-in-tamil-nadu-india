Text: "I am currently living in a reforestation village in India working on the land,\
  \ sleeping in a hut, eating only food which the land provides, and living without\
  \ running water and electricity. Living as the locals do has never been so fulfilling.\n\
  \n6:00am: I start my morning silence as we do each day, \u201CThank you for the\
  \ air in my lungs. Thank you for my healthy, capable body. Thank you for the challenges,\
  \ opportunity, and beauty of this day.\u201D\n\nI\u2019m sitting in the main hut\
  \ in silence with the community. Every Monday morning, we sit in the same quiet\
  \ energy space for 45 minutes. Some people are reading, some writing, others are\
  \ doing yoga and meditating, or even sleeping, but collectively our thoughts and\
  \ feelings are vibrating through the room creating a powerful unified force for\
  \ the week to come.\n\nI feel light here, as if every care or concern I\u2019ve\
  \ had simply lifted itself from my body. My mind is at ease, my thoughts clear,\
  \ and my heart full. You know the days when nothing seems to go wrong\u2026no mishap,\
  \ person, mosquito bite, or traffic jam can get you down? When every problem has\
  \ an easy answer, every ounce of darkness has a light at the end, and you feel that\
  \ at their core, every person is truly good. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve come to\
  \ believe enlightenment to be like.\n\nTo live in that state of joy and peace\u2026\
  .I believe that\u2019s what everyone searches for; a state of being where no matter\
  \ what, you feel content and satisfied and you feel love and gratitude for every\
  \ person and thing in your life, no matter how they may show up sometimes.\n\nI\
  \ am far from any such form of enlightenment and I\u2019m not so sure it\u2019s\
  \ even attainable (or desirable) unless you live alone in a faraway cave or possibly\
  \ Sadhana Forest all your life, but I feel I have found a small piece of it here.\
  \ Maybe it\u2019s just that I\u2019ve allowed my mind the opportunity to quiet down\
  \ long enough to recognize the peace that was always present\u2026the peaceful,\
  \ quiet, place of strength inside that is often covered with the \u201Cdoing\u201D\
  \ of each day.\n\nI make a conscious decision to carry this state of peace with\
  \ me the rest of the day, and the rest of every day moving forward.\n\nMy peace\
  \ of mind is with me as I cut fruit for breakfast, as I wash the morning dishes\
  \ and as I prep vegetables and prepare lunch for the community. It\u2019s with me\
  \ as I go for a bike ride through town, as I water the trees in the forest, and\
  \ as I lay my head down to sleep at night. My peace of mind is with me for good,"
