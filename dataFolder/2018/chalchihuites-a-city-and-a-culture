Text: "I sat in the middle of the town square, gulping down an entire water bottle.\
  \ I didn\u2019t realize how hot it could get down here during Easter weekend, or\
  \ what the locals call, Semana Santa. I had visited my father\u2019s hometown many\
  \ times as a child, but never in late March. I forgot about my internal complaining\
  \ as I observed the crowds gathering on the streets, getting ready for the procession\
  \ to a church in the southernmost part of the town.\nThe name of my father\u2019\
  s hometown is Chalchihuites, located in the state of Zacatecas, in the Northwest\
  \ part of Mexico. The name derives from the Uto-Aztecan language of the Nahuatl\
  \ people, and it means \u201CEmerald,\u201D or \u201Cprecious stone.\u201D The Nahuatl\
  \ people gave this name to the blue-green jade stone during the ancient era of Mexico.\
  \ During this thriving Mesoamerican era, jade was more valuable than silver and\
  \ gold. Therefore, Chalchihuites stones were highly valued and associated with some\
  \ of their Gods. The town sits a few miles from the archeological site of Alta Vista,\
  \ where you can find ruins of a once thriving civilization which flourished during\
  \ the Mesoamerican classical period, and a control center for the turquoise trade\
  \ route. It was a bright sunny day as a group of locals got in their positions to\
  \ start their play of the trial and crucifixion of Jesus. There was a middle aged\
  \ man dressed as Pontius Pilate, two women dressed as Mary the Virgin, and Mary\
  \ Magdalene, a few men dressed as Roman soldiers and a man dressed as Barabbas.\
  \ They acted out the trial and moved off the main stage to lead the procession,\
  \ which consisted of a reenactment of Jesus carrying the cross through the streets\
  \ of Jerusalem. However, there was no actual actor to play Jesus. Instead, a life\
  \ size porcelain figure of a light skinned version of Jesus was paraded around the\
  \ town streets during the entire procession. The soldiers would follow on their\
  \ horses, with their capes decorated with Mexican flag colors and stones. This fusion\
  \ of Roman Catholic influence and local Mexican tradition, was quite a sight to\
  \ see. All 14 Stations of the Cross were reenacted, making a different stop at each\
  \ one. The route ended at the 14th Station, which is where the body of Jesus is\
  \ laid in the tomb. Here, the cast gathers the life size figure of Jesus, and lays\
  \ the body on the altar \u2013 placing a clear glass case over it. I remember feeling\
  \ the devotion the locals had throughout this entire procession. It was an experience\
  \ I\u2019ll never forget."
