Text: "Thinking I was getting away, I flew 7,232 miles for 16 hours, to a city menajeri\
  \ of bright LED billboards and found me. My first trip to China gave me the courage\
  \ to be myself. It was Tuesday when my cousin inquired about my plans for the coming\
  \ Thursday. I\u2019d just quit \u2018the dream job\u2019 working for a major sports\
  \ entertainment brand.My hustle savvy cousin proposed I join him on a trip to Mainland\
  \ China. It would be a chance to get away and possibly find my next chapter. 48\
  \ hours later, I had a ticket, travel docs and was boarding my first flight to Hong\
  \ Kong. There I was bound for the PRC, not a clue as to what awaited.The sixteen\
  \ hour flight was exhausting. After being herded through the terminal maze, we emerged\
  \ from the baggage claim to the arrival lobby.  Planted in the middle of the lobby\
  \ on the first floor was a floor to ceiling Louis Vuitton replica briefcase. Intrigue\
  \ came over me like a rushing tide. Relief, direction, and purpose consumed me.I\
  \ felt  as open and endless as the horizon.Standing in front of our hotel, the moment\
  \ was too big for me to process. I fell in love with China instantly - The raw energy\
  \ of so many people, movement, and trade; rapid growth and expansion; train rides\
  \ that take you past rolling green hills to rice fields and waterways to skyrocketing\
  \ structures that seem to invade heaven; diversity of foreign travelers and exposure\
  \ to culture; and the the food - discovering street food or the produce markets\
  \ is a an excursion throughout the Guangdong province.Before Guangzhou I wasn\u2019\
  t brave enough to fail, let alone explore.I thought that I had to follow a blueprint,\
  \ who\u2019s I couldn\u2019t tell you. Seeking the approval of others and satisfying\
  \ my ego with their applauds was more important than being me. Travel can be a vehicle\
  \ for the process of self discovery and acceptance. Breaking free of what I thought\
  \ other people were thinking about my journey, as if they\u2019re thinking anything\
  \ at all was the first step. Getting on a plane helped me to get out of my head\
  \ and out of my own way.This trip ignited my desire to explore, discover, and connect\
  \ through travel.I returned 2 weeks after my first trip. It wasn\u2019t long before\
  \ I secured an apartment and began traveling back and forth. I was not only visiting,\
  \ I was creating a life thousands of miles away from home and I never felt more\
  \ myself. China is the one destination that I always come back to and each time\
  \ the experience is reinvented exposing a new layer of me. Constantly evolving."
