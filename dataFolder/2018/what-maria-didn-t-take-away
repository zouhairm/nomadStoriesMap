Text: "The first thing I perceived when I arrived in Puerto Rico was that rythms weren\xB4\
  t the same as in Europe.Everything there happens more rapidly, movements are pressured\
  \ and even music seems to be in a hurry. Here, life dances a bolero and Time appears\
  \ to sit and watch the spectacle, with a Pi\xF1a Colada in his hand.\nEven the rain\
  \ falls differently. Given the follage of the whereabouts, it looks as if the trees\
  \ were painted by aquarelle which turns aqueous and decorates its surroundings.Monday\
  \ mornings are sterling festivals of scents, colours and flavours that take place\
  \ in local fruit markets, where the residents enjoy showing the tourists native\
  \ fruits: papayas, guavas, lemons\u2026 On Saturday noons, every single street smells\
  \ like Mofongo, fried mashed banana, cooked by a smiley elderly woman. Truth being\
  \ said, Puerto Rico as a whole looks like an artistic colour palette, composed by\
  \ the light colours of the humble and picturesque little houses of OldSanJuan and\
  \ the dark tones of the night, which never becomes completely black, because of\
  \ the city lights that illuminate it. I liked to stop at the top of ElMorro, an\
  \ ancient fortification, and feel that now life was inviting me to the dance floor.And\
  \ that Time was looking at us smiling, asking for another pi\xF1a colada.\nThe last\
  \ thing I expected was to receive the warning of the passage of Hurricane Maria.That\
  \ September 15th, my world took a 180 degree turn.Time rose quickly from his chair\
  \ and began to run.Radio programs were busy with weather forecasts so music stopped\
  \ ringing.The markets closed and the fruits became luxury products. Time passed\
  \ in the blink of an eye, for when we wanted to realize the whole country was locked\
  \ in their homes.An entire island without anyone in the streets, without a single\
  \ open business.And, after a few hours, without a home with light or water.The place\
  \ that hadn\u2019t known the night, in utter darkness.Despite that, we saw how the\
  \ sky fell and the ocean rose. We felt the world falling apart under our feet.In\
  \ the two days I spent without sleep, I could only think about the colourful houses\
  \ with tin roofs.I imagined them whipped by the sea that had always caressed them,\
  \ buried under the palm trees that once sheltered them.When we were able to leave\
  \ 4 days later, we walked hopelessly through fallen trees, when suddenly we noticed\
  \ a distant smell of fresh Mofongo...It was Saturday.\nAt that very moment, I felt\
  \ that life was raising slowly from the rubble and beginning to dance once again"
