Text: "I hang my head outside the window of the white Land Rover as we drive North\
  \ from Arusha, Tanzania, towards the N\u2019gorongoro Crater. The grass is the colour\
  \ of dry wheat and heat radiates off the land. The planes are dry and stretch for\
  \ miles in every direction. The dust on the dirt road kicks up behind us, billowing\
  \ into orange clouds, coating the truck in dirt. Mothers and their children walk\
  \ barefoot along the side of the road. I stare at the colour of their inky skin,\
  \ a dark rich color, glowing in the hot sun. Babies tied in patterned cloths hang\
  \ off of their bodies, and I can\u2019t help but stare at their exposed breasts.\n\
  \nI\u2019d studied this part of the world in high school, having been fascinated\
  \ by the discoveries made here of fossils, tools, and hominid remains. I'd memorized\
  \ all the names of Australopithecus Afarencis, and as we drive across the planes\
  \ of Tanzania, passing a sign for the Great Rift Valley, I feel like I\u2019m driving\
  \ through evolution.\n\nThe air gets drier as we approach the crater, and after\
  \ four hours on the dusty road we begin the descent downwards. The N'gorongoro crater\
  \ is the largest unflooded and unbroken crater in the world. It\u2019s 20 kilometres\
  \ across, 600 meters deep, and covers 300 square kilometres. The sun is setting\
  \ far off to the west and sprinkles of light travel through the African savannah.\
  \ We park in an open field and the ground under the jeep vibrates like a small earthquake.\
  \ Through the trees we can see the faint grey outline of the large animals. I catch\
  \ myself holding my breath, and as the elephants get closer, I see the babies appearing,\
  \ trailing in between the older ones. We stand in silence for what feels like hours.\
  \ As we move deeper into the crater, I see zebras, lions, giraffes, and hippopotamuses.\
  \ The entire experience is so other worldly that I want to capture it up, and trap\
  \ it inside my memory.\n\nIt\u2019s not until that evening when we arrive at our\
  \ hotel, and I stand in the shower washing off the dusty air from my body, that\
  \ I catch a glimpse of what I left home for. I'd dropped out of school to run from\
  \ the boring textbooks of my university classes, and the feeling of my butt going\
  \ numb from sitting too long. I wanted to taste life instead of reading about it,\
  \ but it's the last I expected to find on the planes of Africa. But here inside\
  \ this ancient crater, it's like I\u2019m standing inside my own humanity, a history\
  \ book about my life. And for the first time it feels like I\u2019m the one who\
  \ gets to write the story."
