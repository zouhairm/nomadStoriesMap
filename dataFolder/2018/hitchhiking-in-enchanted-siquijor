Text: "Yes, Filipinos have superstitions. I used to laugh about their stories, but\
  \ what is really fascinating is that for some reason all tales lead to the enchanted\
  \ island of Siquijor. The fear of this place is as big as that half of the people\
  \ would never set foot in Siquijor. During Holy Week all the healers gather and\
  \ produce death/revival potions. One of the ingredients are human bones which is\
  \ why you can find open graves in Siquijor. It was clear I had to go, so off I went.\n\
  After an incredible day spent at surreal waterfalls, abandoned white sand beaches\
  \ and natural fish spas, we wondered about the magical healers. I knew we had to\
  \ go to San Antonio, a little town up on the hill. Luckily a furniture van took\
  \ us for a scenic drive up there. When we were dropped off at the \u201Ctown center\u201D\
  \ I asked a lady at the sari-sari store and she pointed to the opposite side of\
  \ the street and said:\u201Che\u2019s a healer.\u201D \nThere he was. An old lollo\
  \ (grandpa) with basketball shorts and a gold chain around his neck. I was confused.\
  \ I\u2019m not sure how I imagined a healer to look like, but certainly different\
  \ than him.\nHis name is Vicente. He lives in a corrugated-iron hut, surrounded\
  \ by all kinds of animals you could imagine. We began to quiz him about his work\
  \ and he showed us his love poisons and guardian angels. When he sightly wanted\
  \ us to cut to the trace, we decided to go for what he calls spiritual healing.\
  \ The idea of it was to gut bad spirits inside me. Therefor he had a manufactured\
  \ charcoal with herbs in a pineapple can. He lit the charcoal and put it underneath\
  \ my chair, while he stood behind me, whispering fast sentences in a made-up language\
  \ in my ears. I didn\u2019t know how to act. The whole scenery was bizarre. The\
  \ chicken were constantly clucking. I closed my eyes and forced myself to feel some\
  \ magic. Instead, I could have bursted in laughter any second. I felt like I dishonored\
  \ this man, but I don\u2019t like to shade the truth: I didn\u2019t feel anything\
  \ and I most certainly didn\u2019t feel different afterwards.\nAfter a tip, we walked\
  \ out of his house stunned. Did this really just happen? It was nearly sunset and\
  \ Vicente\u2019s village in golden light looked more beautiful than ever, we could\
  \ have walked through an enchanted forest just as well. I look at my friend and\
  \ she sighed and said \u201CWhat a day.\u201D I nodded and both of us laughed with\
  \ all our heart. We were in the best mood in a long time. About this trip, about\
  \ Siquijor, about the little paradise we had found."
