Text: "'So, what do you think of pre-marital sex?'\nThis, ladies and gentlemen, was\
  \ in the inner shrine of the Kasi Viswanath temple from a lady old enough to be\
  \ my grandmother. The phallic Shiva looks on, amused, I hope.\n\nI am 2000 km from\
  \ home, on my first solo trip. It\u2019s a sweltering afternoon, with no sight of\
  \ the promised monsoon when I hear my tongue amidst a language not entirely foreign.\
  \ I trace the source to a woman gesturing wildly to a disgruntled guard. Home beckons\
  \ and I move past tiny shrines venerating orange boulders. Upon learning that I\
  \ can understand her, their relief is palpable.\nShe wants to see the Kasi Viswanath\
  \ temple, has lost her group, and doesn't remember her hotel.  She brightens up,\
  \ and says, \"No, wait, it started with su, no, se.\" In Kashi, with as many hotels\
  \ as temples, this was like calling an amnesiac to testify. The guard sits down\
  \ with a sigh, and finds monkeys making away with his biscuits. Swearing at them,\
  \ he gingerly has a sip of his tea which is no better than tepid bath water. Spluttering,\
  \ he whets me, convinced I am not a serial killer, places my hand in the old lady\u2019\
  s, blesses me, and leaves. He takes another sip of his tea, more out of denial and\
  \ promptly spits it out.\n\nBefore I know it, we are walking into the temple. \"\
  Why Kasi?\u201D she asks me.\n\"Why not?\"\n\"Well, no parties here or beaches.\
  \ Mostly people atoning for sins or coming here to die.\"\n\u201CI want to experience\
  \ for myself the Ganga aarti.\u201D\nPause.\n'So, what do you think of pre-marital\
  \ sex?'\nI laugh, tell it's more of a fifth date material; she and I are barely\
  \ into our first.\n\nWe walk through alleys like cobwebs with a steady trickle of\
  \ people, vehicles, and cows, all agile and rolling their eyes as we attempt to\
  \ leap across. I learn that her son got his head stuck between the bars of their\
  \ balcony when he was 3. I attempt to stifle a laugh and end up snorting. \n\"Oh,\
  \ go ahead and giggle, I've found that the only way to avoid parental frustration\
  \ is to view him as a source of amusement.\"\n\nAs the sun slowly set over the Ganges,\
  \ we walked over and helped set up the platforms for the aarti. I realize there\
  \ is a reason the aarti is so famous, not for the orchestrated showmanship or the\
  \ live music or the crowds, but the people and their simple joy in living here,\
  \ even as death burns. And so, on an otherwise unremarkable Friday night, in a Kashi\
  \ that was momentarily still, I found home in a place I had never been and in a\
  \ person, I had just met. And it was glorious."
