Text: "I was in red, she was in blue, and to spend New Year\u2019s Eve together in\
  \ an European world-famous spot was a third-world girls\u2019 dream. \n\nWhen we\
  \ got off the cab, we were in an international street party. Tourists and Spanish\
  \ families were enjoying the wait to midnight, and my blond-in-blue friend Alex\
  \ was already high with the experience, but insisted on carrying a bottle of Fernet\
  \ - by the time the year started, she was wasted. I took her just out of the square\
  \ where we had to meet with TheDog. Alex had regressed to early childhood: Waiting\
  \ was impossible to grasp.  And here the best photos of the night begin: a red-dress-mummified\
  \ woman in  heels pulling a rebellious blue shape that pushes weakly to go play.\
  \ A red mother hugging a blue little girl and promising that they\u2019ll be leaving\
  \ soon. A girl who gets lose and runs away while five guys go for the red.\n\nI\
  \ found them all at once, surrounding me. I saw Alex\u2019s fear from the distance\
  \ one second and the next I was lying on the hood of a car, one of the guys squeezing\
  \ my wrists against the metal, the other four, smiling. I could hear in the background\
  \ Alex\u2019s meaningless screams.\n\nA picture of their faces, now seen from below,\
  \ enjoying like hyenas the fear they anticipate. The decision to play the only card\
  \ that my intuition whispers: I look the leader in the eye and, with a deliberately\
  \ cheerful voice, I address them in Italian. They had moved as one, wordless and\
  \ fast. The lascivious smile of the five turns into a grimace. I mention my Genoese\
  \ grandmother to remind them of mothers. The repentant stallions release me in silence.\
  \ As they move away, one turns to speak for the first time: they aren\u2019t Italian,\
  \ they're from San Marino.\n\nWhen TheDog arrives Alex shouts that some guys tried\
  \ to rape me. TheDog ignores her. Come on! To the Nightclub via Puerta del Sol!\
  \ And there is the police, finally, busy running to hit the families that had been\
  \ celebrating in the square with us.\n\nThey are the anti-riot police, helmet and\
  \ shield against teenagers who were happily wishing \u201CHappy new year\u201D and\
  \ now scream \u201CBastards!\u201D. My instinct tells me to hide. I freeze the scene\
  \ again: the police, the furious teens and the scared grandparents; my smart tourist\
  \ outfit and my pocket camera. There I\u2019m neither local nor immigrant, I don\u2019\
  t look like a reporter, the bastards won\u2019t hit me tonight. I approach the armoured\
  \ policemen with the camera on my eye, they see my red curves, stop chasing, stand\
  \ straight and smile for the photo."
