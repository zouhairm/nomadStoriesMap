Text: "When I booked my trip to London, the last thing I expected was to fall in love.\n\
  \nI was bitten by the travel bug when I was still in school. My parents had never\
  \ had the money to go on holiday like other families did, so I started to find my\
  \ opportunities elsewhere. In high school I went to the US with a school team -\
  \ twice, in fact. There I discovered how small New Zealand really is. Dallas and\
  \ Los Angeles were so big in comparison, and while other students were intimidated\
  \ by that fact, I was fascinated. So when I finished school, I booked my first solo\
  \ trip across the ditch to Australia. Then I did it again.\n\nThat was when London\
  \ started calling me.\n\nI had met a group of people online, total nerds like me,\
  \ and a few of them were meeting up for London Comic-Con. While others in the group,\
  \ from all over the world, were saying \"it's too far, I can't do it,\" I was looking\
  \ up flights.\nGrowing up we were told never to give our names out on the internet,\
  \ and here I was spending thousands of dollars to go meet these people.\n\nAs it\
  \ turns out, London is truly a romantic city. I took the cliche tourist photos,\
  \ I found the streets from Monopoly, I watched ballet in the Royal Opera House,\
  \ and on my last night, I rode the London Eye. That ride either ruined or made my\
  \ life - I still haven't decided which. \n\nI went to London to meet friends, and\
  \ left with the knowledge that New Zealand was not enough. To stand in that plastic\
  \ bubble and look out at the city lights, neon colours stretching beyond the horizon,\
  \ defined the rest of my life to come. I am a city girl, through and through. There\
  \ is nothing that can compare to those lights.\nNow that's what I do. I travel to\
  \ big cities, I find the tallest buildings, and I stare at the ocean of colour that\
  \ sparks emotions I never feel anywhere else. \n\nPeople never understand when I\
  \ try to explain it to them. \n\"They're just lights,\" they say, \"why are they\
  \ so special?\"\nPhotos don't do it justice, either. Trying to fit that expanse\
  \ into a tiny little frame almost feels blasphemous. \nThere's only one other feeling\
  \ that humans have that we can't explain: Love.\n\nSo I tell them: When you fall\
  \ in love, you can describe what you like about the person, or the things you do\
  \ together, but you can't explain the way it makes you feel. You can't put that\
  \ wealth of complex emotion into words that people can understand. \nAnd when I\
  \ stood over 100 metres in the air, on a cold winter night, behind a thin, transparent\
  \ wall, I fell in love."
