Text: "Being asked to travel to India over the summer was problematic. Summer is my\
  \ only time off. I have a weak stomach at the best of times. I don't like crowded\
  \ places. I have strong socialist views. After first deliberating my poor gut health\
  \ record and then everything else, I surprised myself, and probably everyone who\
  \ knows me, by saying 'yes'. This opportunity was not going to present itself again\
  \ anytime soon and it was time to take on the challenge of the universe.\n \nSo\
  \ armed with enough medication to open up my own chemist, but surprisingly not quite\
  \ enough to alarm customs, I packed up and headed to India. Arriving at Indira Gandhi\
  \ International Airport for the first time was a true assault on the senses: the\
  \ crowds of people clamoring at the entrance as the passengers wend their way out\
  \ of the arrivals hall; the non-stop cacophony that bombarded the ears with calls\
  \ and pleas for people to take up an offer for a ride into the city, car horns,\
  \ and dogs barking; the smells - many of which were indistinguishable - that invaded\
  \ the nose and mouth; and cars going every which way. It was almost enough for me\
  \ to turn around and get the next flight home. But this was my challenge and I had\
  \ accepted it.\n\nIndia proved to be a barrage on every sense with the brazenly\
  \ colourful saris and spice powders contrasting vividly against often bleak, sometimes\
  \ shabby urban environments enshrouded in a pungent smog. This was Delhi and it\
  \ is a city with which I now have a love-hate relationship. I folded to a case of\
  \ Delhi Belly which was to last long after the trip finished and I was emotionally\
  \ attacked by the visions of slum kids being physically maimed in order to attract\
  \ sympathy from tourists for money, while billion-dollar industries rose up to shadow\
  \ and try to hide the poverty-stricken inhabitants. It was the spirit of the everyday\
  \ person and the belief in the importance of family above all else that really shone\
  \ through the filth and grime which allowed the city to get under your skin. These\
  \ people live with the issues daily, struggle against what seem impossible odds,\
  \ and yet they emerge smiling, polite, friendly and even enviably happy. It makes\
  \ you consider all that we take for granted back home. This is the legacy of visiting\
  \ India.\n\nI suffered severe illness for almost a year after, but I was then catapulted\
  \ into the best health I have had in my entire life that 'To Delhi' was the best\
  \ decision. I have been equally moved and scarred deeply. Thank you, India."
