Text: "I\u2019ve always dreamt of living in New York. And even though I always knew\
  \ that this was only but a fantasy, in typical fan-girl-like fashion, I often fell\
  \ victim to spending hours on Google \u2013 searching for studio apartments to hire\
  \ and jobs in the Big Apple.\n\nI regularly dream about travelling via the notoriously\
  \ smelly NYC subway, being clich\xE9 and hailing a yellow cab, taking leisurely\
  \ walks through Central Park, having a stack of fluffy flapjacks for brunch, seeing\
  \ Times Square at night, Brooklyn, Manhattan, this list could go on forever! But\
  \ when reality kicks in I realise that, sadly, this will only become a reality in\
  \ the (very far) future.\n\nOne day I had an epiphany \u2013 I found a temporary\
  \ substitute for my New York wanderlust and it was right under my nose the whole\
  \ time - I just had to wake up and appreciate what I had right here.\n\nI can\u2019\
  t physically live the NYC dream at the moment, so I made a local connection and\
  \ brought New York City to The Mother\u2019s City! Now I know that Cape Town is\
  \ in no way a substitute for the real deal. I can't imagine anything coming close\
  \ to the euphoria of experiencing the Concrete Jungle in the flesh but I was determined\
  \ to make it work as best I could.\n\nI set a Saturday aside and planned a morning\
  \ of New York meets Cape Town.\n\nWe started the day by braving the danger that\
  \ is Metrorail, Cape Town\u2019s failing rail service, and took a trip to our CBD.\n\
  \nApon arrival in the big city, in a bid to recreate a walk through Central Park,\
  \ we grabbed takeaway coffees, the most delicious cream cheese bagels and took a\
  \ walk through the park. The Cape is known for its lush fauna and flora and this\
  \ spot is ideal for experiencing a piece of this wonder while it also serves as\
  \ a lovely substitute for Central Park's greenery.\n\nOn the other side of \u201C\
  Central Park\u201D, as we made our way to Loop Street, we were met by Town\u2019\
  s towering buildings and home to a street that\u2019s rapidly proving to be Cape\
  \ Town\u2019s latest foodie hotspot. The newly opened Solo restaurant turned out\
  \ to be the ideal spot as they serve quintessential NYC brunch items. I opted for\
  \ the classic eggs Benedict with crispy bacon and as it was almost lunchtime, my\
  \ partner had a hamburger.\n\nOn our way back, we hopped into an Uber we had requested\
  \ (obviously a yellow cab in my mind!) and made our way to our last stop, the Artscape\
  \ Theatre. Here we enjoyed a show fit for the stages of Broadway. We sang along,\
  \ \u201CNew York, New York\u201D and suddenly the city that never sleeps didn't\
  \ feel that far away anymore."
