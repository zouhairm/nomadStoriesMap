Text: "Sometimes the most important people in your life are just passing through.\
  \ They are the kind of people who drift into your life for a brief moment, yet carry\
  \ in their wake the momentum of personality which changes your perspective. These\
  \ people are few and far between: fairies in the sparsely populated realm of the\
  \ nomad. These peculiar people rarely stick around long. They are always called\
  \ on to new places, chasing the wind.  Yet one afternoon. One night.  One moment\
  \ is all it takes. \nThe waves chased my feet up the shallow banks of sand, my way\
  \ lit by a full moon. It had been a lonely day. A lonely week. A lonely year, really.\
  \ Long distance relationships have a way of getting to you, especially with the\
  \ recent revelations about the state of things. I dragged a stick aimlessly in the\
  \ sand. I questioned a lot of things that night, wandering along the edge of the\
  \ ocean. Every question led to another and another...you know the way an anxious\
  \ mind digs itself into the depths. \nNormally the wilderness was my sanctuary.\
  \ My fortress. Yet I found my solitude being breached by sadness and uncertainty.\
  \ I'd given up my aimless walking for the night, and returned to camp. It was empty,\
  \ as it should have been for the time of the night. Then a light, bobbing in the\
  \ bush caught my attention. Who could be wandering into camp at 11pm? \nCurious,\
  \ I watched as a girl trudged out of the wilderness, an eager smile on her face.\
  \ She pulled me into conversation with a practiced ease, yet somehow we skipped\
  \ the rudimentary questions that backpackers ask. Instead of \"what do you do?\"\
  \ or \"where are you from?\" we asked \"what do you regret?\" and \"what do you\
  \ wish you could change?\" \nAfter a quick midnight meal, we returned to our conversations.\
  \ Talking about life, God, death, family...Never has someone so briefly been a part\
  \ of my life who changed me so severely. It was as if she'd had the perfect response\
  \ to every question that had been burning in my soul. She related her experiences,\
  \ and I told her of mine. She had been in med school before realizing she hated\
  \ it.  She dropped out to chase the wind. To learn, live, laugh, and love. Upon\
  \ hearing her experiences, I found clarity in mine. \nI learned that day (among\
  \ many other things) that it is never too late to chase your dreams. Its never to\
  \ late to change direction and live the life you have imagined: if only you have\
  \ to courage to take the first steps. The people who can change you are all around:\
  \ if you're willing to meet them."
