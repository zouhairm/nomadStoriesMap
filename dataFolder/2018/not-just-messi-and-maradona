Text: "Well I\xB4m a jung man, I started to travel in 2015, but actually it was not\
  \ a pleasure trip, it was to save money to my next big trip: Europe and more. So\
  \ to make that possible I applied for a scholarship in Germany. I thought, if I\
  \ win this, they pay everything and I have my base in Europe to make a lot of travels.\
  \ So I learned 3 years German and I did everything to win this scholarship, at the\
  \ end, I won it. 60 students of all Argentina won it, and 1 me. So I traveled to\
  \ Spain\n( Madrid), and I started a big trip around Europe( Spain,Portugal, France,\
  \ Belgium, Netherland, Germany, Italy,Czech Republic) when I finish it, I traveled\
  \ to Marokko, and then I was impressed with the arabic culture. So I returned to\
  \ Europe and I went to Germany to establish my base in Dresden. I went to the university\
  \ and I met the requirements of my scholarship. With my monthly payment, I minimized\
  \ food expenses to the maximum and started looking for low cost flights. I started\
  \ traveling a lot with Ryanair, just with my tent, my sleeping bag and a chair,\
  \ so I could meet countries like Norway, Israel and Egypt. Use the couchsurfing\
  \ platform to not spend money on accommodation, meet the locals and eat the food\
  \ of the place (which I really enjoy)\n.To have enough couchsurfing comments and\
  \ for people to stay, I started to host people 3 years before the trip at my parents'\
  \ house in Argentina,that way I could also practice German."
