Text: "I climbed up the stairs of a Mosque at dusk, expecting foods for iftar, I was\
  \ homesick and starving from fasting in Ramadhan. A grumpy old lady approached me,\
  \ grumbling in a language I don\u2019t understand and walked away. Left me standing\
  \ and clueless. She came back and tossed me a veil, children laughed at me as I\
  \ wore it. She tried to talk to me many times. \n\n\u201CI apologize but I do not\
  \ speak Vietnamese,\u201D I replied in a language that she did not understand. \n\
  \nThe same lady peeled an egg and a banana for me, poured me coffee with no words\
  \ but kindness. I thought the coffee was for everyone else, turned out it was from\
  \ her personal cup she brought from home. I smiled and looked at her happily before\
  \ I was immersed in the food. The name of the mosque is Th\xE1nh \u0110\u01B0\u1EDD\
  ng Jamiul Islamiyah. I heard the sound of Takbir for Eid-al-Fitr, just the sound\
  \ I wanted to hear. A real sound replacing youtube videos I played to fulfill the\
  \ absence of home in my heart. It was my first time ever solo traveling, and I was\
  \ only 20. However, I was never terrified, the idea of an adventure excites me instead.\n\
  \nComing there was the best decision I made during my stay. I came back to the Mosque\
  \ for Eid, searching everywhere for that lady. I handed her a jar of cookies when\
  \ I found whom I was looking for. It\u2019s a tradition to eat crumble cakes for\
  \ Eid in my country.\n\n\u201CHello, this is for you, happy Eid,\u201D I spoke to\
  \ her while smiling.\n\nDespite the language barrier, I knew she understood from\
  \ the gesture. She was surprised and talked happily. She caressed my head as I kissed\
  \ the back of her hand. We speak different mother language, and she speaks no second\
  \ language. She first came to me being grumpy, but we bid an unsaid goodbye in warmth.\
  \ It was the second and the last time I ever saw her before I went back home. \n\
  \nLiving in Indonesia has always made me the majority. Eating and praying decently\
  \ everywhere. Being a minority once in a while changed the whole me; from the way\
  \ I think, to the way I live my life in the present days. For almost a month being\
  \ in a foreign land, I never felt so much at home. Wherever I am, finding a home\
  \ is possible. Yet I realized it\u2019s not about the same religion we hold, it\u2019\
  s more than that: It\u2019s kindness and values we share."
