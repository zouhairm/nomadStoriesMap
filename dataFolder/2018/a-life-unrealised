Text: "Waves played in her eyes like fireflies around a torch. Flecks&flashes of colour\
  \ danced across the pools of deep green bringing them alive, the ocean living in\
  \ her eyes. Cheeks lush with colour as life rushed through her veins. The cool water\
  \ chilling her, the salt on her lips, her raven black hair whipping her back urging\
  \ her on. Her world disappeared in the elixir of movement. As she glided across\
  \ the expanse, she was free. The ocean lived in her&in the very moment she felt\
  \ most alive, her body at one with nature, the spilt second she understood it all\
  \ before being draw headlong into the next, I drowned. \nMy world became dark. Blurs\
  \ of green, blue&black, my mind trying desperately to understand it, fighting to\
  \ keep the panicked animal in my exploding chest from breaking free&robbing me of\
  \ all rational thought.\nThen the light appeared, the surface, precious air! I broke\
  \ through the surf, lungs screaming for oxygen&gasped a half breath as another wave\
  \ crashed down, more water than air entering my lungs. The animal was loose. I flailed\
  \ for something to grab, something to cling to even for a moment, just a moment's\
  \ rest, please. The board was gone, gone from the moment I had flung myself headlong\
  \ into the Atlantic Ocean, swallowed by the ocean that toyed with me with undisguised\
  \ contempt. I was an unwelcome guest in its world&I was to know how it loathed me,\
  \ before it coughed me, dazed and dishevelled, onto the sand. \n\n\u2018Boy you\u2019\
  ll not get anywhere getting on like that\u2019 she said with a smile of warning\
  \ & warm. \n\u2018You\u2019re not in charge out there. You can\u2019t make the water\
  \ do what you want, she won\u2019t have that at all now, so she won\u2019t\u2019\
  . \nHer gentle Cork accent was stark amongst the native voices of Dunfanaghy as\
  \ it played the words of my scolding like notes a symphony. She could have been\
  \ reading a parking ticket & I would have been entranced. My bruised pride hurt\
  \ as much as the salt in my eyes. My efforts to impress my surf instructor had been\
  \ woeful, in&out of the water. A feeling of sickly unease rolled in my stomach as\
  \ the salt water the ocean had gifted me threatened to evacuate. I sipped the tea\
  \ she had bought for me&nodded. Then he walked in. The same smile as her, the same\
  \ raven hair & the same ease of movement, a confidence which filled the room. The\
  \ same green eyes which came alive for her in the ocean reached across the room\
  \ from him&held me in their gaze. It was the last thing I expected. For the second\
  \ time that day, I drowned. A blissful drowning."
