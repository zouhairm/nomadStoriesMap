Text: "India. That place that will surprise, delight and frustrate you. We arrived\
  \ overland from Nepal on a very cold, foggy December afternoon. Gorakhpur was the\
  \ first town where we could pick up a train connection to Delhi and it was a quirky\
  \ snapshot of what was to come. On the small main street, bony cows wandered around,\
  \ heads in and around bins; people sat on stools having their ears manually drained\
  \ and cleaned with a tube, as per the diagram that would be proffered us many times;\
  \ a man took a soapy strip-wash in front of a shop; a barber shaved throats a stone\u2019\
  s throw from a busy chai-stand and a bustling restaurant selling mouth-watering\
  \ talias and parathas dripping with ghee; cars and buses beeped \u2013 and beeped\
  \ and beeped. But it was a greyer version of India, as the thick fog and winter\
  \ coats hid the usual vibrant colours.  \nWe had a 20-hour overnight train ride\
  \ ahead of us. Too late to get seats in the highly-recommended aircon carriages\
  \ we settled for Sleeper Class. Here is what I learnt that first night: Do not be\
  \ put off if you find 6 people sitting snugly on your bed; show them your ticket\
  \ and they will amiably shove up and make space for you. When you want to sleep,\
  \ simply gesture to them and they move into the aisle, no fuss. During the night\
  \ families board the train with elaborate meals packed in their bags; the meals\
  \ are laid out on a blanket on the floor right by your head and the families talk\
  \ loudly as they eat, leaning on your bed to steady themselves as they dip paratha\
  \ into the ghee-laden sauce, maybe even perching a bum cheek on the edge. The chai\
  \ wallah navigates his way through the carriage doing a roaring trade, carving a\
  \ path ahead of him with his nasal calling of \u201Cchaiiiii!\u201D And in the morning,\
  \ after 40 hours on a train with facilities consisting of a hole in the floor, the\
  \ passengers meticulously smarten themselves up, clean teeth, twizzle moustaches,\
  \ adjust saris, and step off looking immaculate.\nFor our last journey we succeeded\
  \ in buying much-coveted AC tickets. That night, after I had drawn the curtain across\
  \ my bed (curtain!) I heard noisy families board the train. Someone threw back my\
  \ curtain and told me, too loudly for midnight, that his daughter had a ticket to\
  \ the other half of the bed. So that\u2019s why the guard had said \u201C2-2\u201D\
  \ when checking my ticket!  A full price ticket for half a bed.  Oh India, at every\
  \ junction you threw surprises at our baffled faces.   Give me the familiarity of\
  \ a Sleeper carriage any night!"
