Text: "Shimla was merely a stopover for us that day. We were knocking the doors of\
  \ this hill station at the sunset while started on a motorcycle from Delhi this\
  \ dawn. The journey was madness, with one photographer friend named Darshan, I intended\
  \ to drive my old motorcycle to the highest village of the world in Spiti range\
  \ of the Himalayas, and in the coldest month of year, January. The colors in the\
  \ sky made it less miserable to be stuck in traffic while entering this tourist\
  \ place. Many hotel sales guys were trying to get business from every car passing\
  \ by. \nSome were Kashmiri people, those bearded men, wearing long warm and loose\
  \ dress \u2018Firan\u2019. Often sighted as daily wage laborer at different tourist\
  \ places in recent times, migrated from their very own \u2018paradise on earth\u2019\
  \ Kashmir. And why won\u2019t they, when there could be seen more gunmen than tourists\
  \ in the valley, at their home. \nI stayed with the help of an old Kashmiri man,\
  \ had interesting chat with him about migration, my education and some good non-veg\
  \ food in Shimla. The old fellow was hesitating to suggest an ordinary and not very\
  \ clean place near mosque, where he used to eat.\nDarshan and me got there asking\
  \ for directions and climbing many roads. After entering a big gate, the ambiance\
  \ was similar to a Sufi-shrine and at the end of the dark gallery, there were dim\
  \ lights and loud chatter coming from the unknown right turn. As we approached further\
  \ and could see those two food shops, the scene was straight from the city of Kabul.\
  \ Being never there, but same as painted in novels of Khaled Hossaini, it was like\
  \ Kabul with non-veg food shops, with hundreds of old and young Kashimiri men resembling\
  \ Afghans, eating rice and meat on the small tables, some waiting in queues, smoke\
  \ coming from shops and mouths. I might not have felt the place deeper if Darshan\
  \ wasn\u2019t amazed, \u201CDanish bro! see how beautiful and so many frames are\
  \ here, and I am not carrying my camera as we came only for food\u201D. \nWe kept\
  \ turning our heads to quench our curiosity of Kabul while eating the finger licking\
  \ mutton. We were not getting their language but could sense their happiness of\
  \ being together, and sadness of being away from Kashmir. We were not embarrassed\
  \ to stare the tallest guy or the old man with the longest beard. The walking after\
  \ dinner was never enough to the attempt of capturing those frames into my eyes.\
  \ The camera was not with us to find a small Kabul in Shimla as it was the last\
  \ thing expected on this trip."
