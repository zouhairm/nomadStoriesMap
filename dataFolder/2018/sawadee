Text: "I woke up in a small village outside Nong Khai.\nNothing but fisher men working.\n\
  I was by the shore of Meh Kong. The giant river.\nThe day passed hot and slowly.\
  \ The sun was going down, losing itself in beautiful colors.\nWas the perfect moment\
  \ to jog.\nRunning is the best way to free mind and body. Breathing, releasing all\
  \ the problems.\nRunning is an act of faith.\nRight foot. Left foot.\nYou decide\
  \ your own rhythm.\nThe riverside is stunning and local people just start to coming\
  \ back to their houses. Everyone is staring at me way more than I expected.\nThailand\
  \ is a very touristic place, but in the wild north is not so common to see a foreign\
  \ guy.\nI just passed a large group of young kids playing together.\nAs soon as\
  \ I crossed their view they just immediately stopped playing.\nEveryone is looking\
  \ at me, in a deep weird silence.\nI don\u2019t care, i just want to run.\nOn my\
  \ path there\u2019s a lil kid. Is happy and has a big smile, he\u2019s playing on\
  \ the ground trying to catch some insects.\nI just slowly start to walk, as soon\
  \ as he sees me his face changes rapidly and became terrified!\nHis mother just\
  \ run to him, grabbing by the arm Yelling \u201CKoo Toot\u201D.\nI have no idea\
  \ what it means but it doesn't sound too good.\nEveryone is looking at me.\nI start\
  \ to walk towards those kids that looked me as I was a ghost.\n\u201CHi! I\u2019\
  m a just a tourist.. I\u2019m Italian!\u201D\nNo answers back.\n\u201CI.. I just\
  \ want to meet you!\u201D\nThey look themselves. A brave kid start to walk towards\
  \ me. \nNow they\u2019re all walking.\nThere\u2019s like fifteen kids, they create\
  \ a circle around me, studying me a zoo animal.\nI decided to just sit on the ground,\
  \ legs crossed, smiling.\nThey all smile. Now everyone is sitting on the ground.\n\
  A kid put faster his hand on my head, than on my face studying me with his fingers.\n\
  Now they\u2019re all touching me. My nose, my mouth, my earrings.\nI naturally laugh,\
  \ and everybody start laughing.\nOne of the kids started to shake his hand saying\
  \ \u201CSawadee\u201D\n\u201CCiao\u201D I reply. \nEveryone is saying \u201CCiao\u201D\
  .\nWe all laugh saying \u201CSawadee\" and \u201CCiao\u201D over and over.\nAnother\
  \ kid appears in front of me from nowhere.\n He\u2019s putting a hand on his chest.\n\
  \u201CChan chue Kamon\u201D. \nHe\u2019s still touching his chest \u201CKamon! Kamon!\u201D\
  .\nIt has to be his name.\nI smile. Replying saying my name.\nWe stayed on that\
  \ ground for ages, when the sun was simply disappearing, exchanging words in our\
  \ languages, studying ourselves and laughing as never before.\nThe sky paint itself\
  \ with all the colors of the night, giving space to a thousand of beautiful stars."
