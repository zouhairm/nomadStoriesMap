Text: "We wake up early to get to Koure to see the giraffes. In the city, the activity\
  \ has been going on for a while. The traffic, the stands and the eternal walkers\
  \ welcome us. As we get out of the city, the crowds clear-off, it\u2019s easier\
  \ to breathe, and what lays below the rubbish starts to appear: the African savannah.\n\
  \ \nThe 50 kilometres between Niamey and Koure take us an hour, taking into account\
  \ customs, police posts and our rickety taxi. But the journey is worth it. Seeing\
  \ life passing by in movement through a window is a privilege and a way to organise\
  \ your own chronology. On route, thoughts are put into words, new ones are born,\
  \ and one reconnects with the inner dialogue.  \n\nIn our imagination, Africa always\
  \ appears painted with thousands of colours. But in its cities, the most representatives\
  \ are only three. The reddish ochre of its streets and houses, and the black and\
  \ white of the smoke that the thousands of cars wandering around spit out. Xavier,\
  \ our host in Niger, summarized it once in a moment of lucidity. \n\n\u2018The true\
  \ African tree is not the baobab, the acacia or the verdant tropical tree. It\u2019\
  s a lonely tree, in a shore on any of its streets, dry, covered in dust, and which\
  \ leaves have been replaced for the thousands of black plastic bags that fly around\
  \ in the Sahel wind, getting stuck in its branches.\u2019 I think it\u2019s one\
  \ of the metaphors that better expresses the duality of this land. \n\nWith all\
  \ these thoughts we arrive at Koure. Ali, our guide, is a man of kind gestures and\
  \ easy smile and boards the taxi with us. Ornithologist, he works the seasons between\
  \ Koure and the Park of W, down south, in the border with Nigeria and Mali. Despite\
  \ being close enough to be considered an old man, he doesn\u2019t hesitate in getting\
  \ through the window and climb to the car\u2019s door, watching over in the look\
  \ for the giraffes, while our car suffers from the potholes and stones. And thanks\
  \ to him, we suddenly arrive, almost without noticing. They are impressive. Horses\
  \ full of steroids with two-meter necks. Their skins are splashed of beautiful brown\
  \ islands. Peaceful but imposing, they allow me to get close enough to look them\
  \ into the eyes and feel tiny by their side.  Our guide is grateful for having a\
  \ quiet group that appreciate the animals and for being lucky enough to find them.\
  \ Even Amadou, our cab driver, shows the glimpse of a true smile, of pure joy, when\
  \ he contemplates them. \n\nWhen left alone, Africa shows its beauty without reservations."
