Text: "3 flights. Nearly 2 days later. My ankles were swollen and I was drunkenly\
  \ tired, but I reached my destination and was fizzing with excitement. After some\
  \ much needed rest at my hotel, I started training week. During my breaks I was\
  \ busy getting transit passes and completing mandatory medical exams. Oddly enough,\
  \ I was experiencing peculiar symptoms which I easily blamed on jet lag, exhaustion\
  \ and nerves. I am no hypochondriac. I had bubbles ascending rhythmically in my\
  \ throat. There was a piercingly sharp pain on my right side that was intensifying.\
  \ WHAT\u2026THE\u2026.???? Turns out me being jet lagged, over-tired and nervous\
  \ were NOT the issue. My medical report came back with the diagnosis of a \"spontaneous\
  \ pneumothorax\" a.k.a. a collapsed lung. The doctors spoke little to know English\
  \ so it was awesome to hear the doctor say \"Not serious, but uh...surgery...mmm.\"\
  \ I was afraid of losing my job and how I was going to pay for everything. I exhausted\
  \ all options and my friend took the initiative to launch an online fundraiser for\
  \ me. Within a few days, it raised over $10,000. Grateful doesn\u2019t begin to\
  \ express how I felt, nothing can sum it up. With it, I was able to get my surgery\
  \ but could not fly for 2 years due to the fatal risk. The doctor spotted one glitch\
  \ later on my CT scan. A blep: a tiny pocket that formed outside of my lung and\
  \ without removal would lead to another collapse. I needed more invasive surgery.\
  \ I could not help but cry. I needed another painful surgery and with this news,\
  \ I also lost my job. No job. No house. No money. BONUS: zero-proficiency in Korean.\
  \ SHIT. Thankfully, it was an easy decision: I had to do it. I was wheeled in and\
  \ successfully wheeled out of my second surgery. I awoke in tremendous pain, unable\
  \ to speak- but the staff was kind and injected pain medications to soothe it. During\
  \ my post-op recovery, I interviewed for other ESL jobs in South East Asia and in\
  \ less than 2 months, I landed on my feet again- this time in Kaohsiung, Taiwan.\
  \ Thanks to everyone who helped me when I needed it most, I spent the year studying\
  \ Mandarin, teaching ESL to cute Taiwanese kids and making new friends. I visited\
  \ temples, beaches, clubs, night markets and hiked mountains. I enjoyed the wind\
  \ blowing through my hair while driving my beloved (and now dearly missed) scooter.\
  \ I followed this by teaching ESL in Peru. This experience shook me up for the better\
  \ and now, I am more grateful and excited to continue exploring & live life to the\
  \ fullest."
