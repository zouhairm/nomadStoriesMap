Text: "We made our way down the well worn steps into the beer cellar of U Pinkaso,\
  \ the first bar in Prague to serve Pilsner Urquell the world\u2019s first golden\
  \ pilsner beer. Travelling from my home in Vermont, a state proud of its booming\
  \ craft brewery business, I couldn\u2019t visit so close to the birthplace of one\
  \ of my favorite types of beer without tasting some history. So down the well-worn\
  \ steps we plodded, and through the tightly-packed tables of native Prazaci (Praguers)\
  \ filling the air with slavic consonants and cigarette smoke. Finally we found a\
  \ small table right in the back with three seats open.\nSitting next to a complete\
  \ stranger would have given me pause a week ago, but I was well on my way to understanding\
  \ new customs and didn\u2019t hesitate to claim my seat with a jacket and wedge\
  \ myself between the wall and a jolly red-faced man eating borscht.\n\n\u201CAsk\
  \ for a plzen mleko,\u201D advised my expatriate friend Chris, \u201CYou\u2019ll\
  \ love it.\u201D\n\nHaving no reason to doubt him, I asked in my abysmal Czech accent:\
  \ \u201CPlzen mleko, prosim.\u201D What I was given moments later was right out\
  \ of a beer-drinkers nightmare. Having worked as a waiter and bartender for three\
  \ years I knew the proper way to pour beer from a tap left a clear glass of beautiful\
  \ amber liquid, with a thin layer of foam holding everything down. Too much foam\
  \ and your client was likely to complain, too little and they\u2019d think the beer\
  \ was flat. I usually aimed for about a half-inch of foam in my own pints. What\
  \ I was given that night in the basement of U Pinkaso was a mug full from bottom\
  \ to top with nothing but bubbly, white foam. I gave Chris my best, \u2018you can\u2019\
  t be serious\u2019 look complete with one raised-eyebrow.\n\n\u201CWhat can I say?\u201D\
  \ he responded, smiling behind his own much more liquid but still quite foamy pilsner,\
  \ \u201CThe Czechs love the foam.\u201D\n\nI later learned from a waitress with\
  \ very good English that you usually order mleko if you want to drink, but don\u2019\
  t want to get drunk. It\u2019s the Czech national beverage for designated drivers\
  \ and business lunches. You can also order plzen snyt, served about 50-50 beer and\
  \ foam, for when you can\u2019t decide.\n\nI drank my mleko reflecting on what kind\
  \ of person came up with such an absurd, to me, way to enjoy beer and ordered a\
  \ few more, served regularly this time. Which, in Prague, still comes with one quarter\
  \ of the glass filled with foam. Though the love of beer may cross cultural lines,\
  \ not so much how we drink it."
