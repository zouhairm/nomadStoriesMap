Text: "My first stop in Peru was Mancora - a small, beachy town. My accommodation\
  \ consisted of a basic hut, but mere footsteps away lay the ocean. This was the\
  \ main draw of the town, with its perfect waves and sleepy atmosphere. I saw the\
  \ area as perfect for recharging some batteries before moving on. I was wrong. \n\
  \nThe peaceful beach town by day turned into a war zone between crickets and humans\
  \ by night.\n\nI entered my hut on the first night and was hit in the head by an\
  \ insect the size of a ping-pong ball. I pulled my mosquito net around me and turned\
  \ the light off in the hope this would halt the cricket\u2019s excitement. This\
  \ actually made it worse as I could hear them hurtling from wall to wall but couldn\u2019\
  t see them so when one inevitably managed to crawl under the net and jump around\
  \ in bed with me it was even more shocking.\n\nI have never been too squeamish about\
  \ insects but this was too far for me. I had unfortunately booked my onward travel\
  \ so I had little choice but to stay a further 3 nights. However, I refused to stay\
  \ in the hut, which was equivalent to being trapped in a horror film. I found a\
  \ hotel instead where there were no holes leading to the outside, and so I hoped\
  \ no crickets. \n\nNow I was aware of the infestation I saw the town in a new light.\
  \ My eyes were drawn to every crevice where I could see hordes of crickets lying\
  \ dormant in the shadows. Fortunately, my room was now 80% cricket proof and I thought\
  \ I was safe \u2013 and I was - until the last night when things escalated.\n\n\
  As the sun fell behind the ocean the crickets made the usual appearance but I noticed\
  \ a huge increase. There were flocks of insects gravitating toward the bright streetlights.\
  \ I ran into a restaurant only to discover that was not safe either. As I ordered\
  \ my meal I noticed insects crawling everywhere and falling into the food. Sadly,\
  \ my room also did not escape the almighty cricket plague. I found myself again\
  \ surrounded and slept with a shoe in my hand as a weapon. The next morning the\
  \ room was strewn with a good hundred crickets, which had met an unfortunate end.\n\
  \nThe thing that astounded me most about this phenomenon was how the locals took\
  \ it in their stride. They made no fuss and did the best they could by clearing\
  \ the insects each day and awaiting the next wave. It felt like a war between the\
  \ insects and town but rather than a violent clash, the strategy was patience. Instead\
  \ of trying to force out the bad times they were simply going to wait until they\
  \ passed, as they usually did."
