Text: "It's was our first holidays out of Spain. I'm from Spain, but she's ecuatorian.\
  \ For about five years she claimed to me for going to Ecuador, but finally we decided\
  \ travel to Mexico. We were just married and it was our honeymoon. We were really\
  \ happy.\nThree hours by car and another nine by plane. Finally, we wer at in the\
  \ airport from Canc\xFAn. \"It's fantastic! You will see new tres and animals...\
  \ and the fruits... ooooooh!\", said to me Margarita. We were talking about mojitos,\
  \ beaches and dancing for hours when we arrived to the Passport control.\nFor a\
  \ second, I had a bad sensation. \"We are so much happy, it's no posible\", I said\
  \ to myself. And it happened. \"Sorry lady, we have an small problem with your passport\"\
  , said to Margarita a fat man who dindn't learn to smile. \"You are from Ecuador,\
  \ and ecuatorian need to have a visa in M\xE9xico\", explained. \"But she's married\
  \ with me, and she's the wife of a man from UE\", I answered.\nThe man did't want\
  \ doing anithing for us. He said that we had an easy solution: come back to Spain,\
  \ go to M\xE9xico's Embassy in Madrid, ask for the visa, and travel to Canc\xFA\
  n. He didn't atend that no one explainet to us that she needed the visa, including\
  \ the control in Barajas before to acces to the plane.\nMargarita was crying and\
  \ I was more and more angry, for one minute to another one. \"You will go to Spain\
  \ and if you don't shut up, I'll call the p\xF3lice\", said the stupid fat man.\
  \ Finally, Margarita went to the plane, and I went for our bags and to pay the rates\
  \ for tourist in M\xE9xico... and we didn't go out of the airport!!!!\nWe don't\
  \ remind worst hours of that travel. We were crying for hours and finally we sleeped.\
  \ We arrived to Madrid and ha phoned the person who sent the tickets. He excused\
  \ and gave away to us a travel to Tenerife. It was our honeymoon and obviously,\
  \ we don't have a good remind of that.\nWe were to Tenerife, and it was raining\
  \ in a place where usually is hot. Finally, we didn't have good luck. Some days\
  \ after, I went to the Ricardo Tormo Circuit, of motorsport. I'm journalist and\
  \ Cheste organised the 'Finales Mundiales de Ferrari'. One of the events of that\
  \ days was a race for mans with a lot of money whit the F\xF3rmula 1 cars. A mexican\
  \ bought tho Raikkonen's bolido in 2008. I interviewed that man for my newspaper\
  \ and, after that, we spoke some minutes.\nI explainet him what happened to Margarita\
  \ and me in our honeymoon, and he was surprised. \"Really? That's a problem with\
  \ solution\", said. I couldn't believe it."
