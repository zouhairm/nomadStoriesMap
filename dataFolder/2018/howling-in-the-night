Text: "Their voices struck like wild dogs cornered in a fight, raging for dominance.\
  \  White eyed, fingers flew accusations in a language I couldn't understand, but\
  \ I knew at the heart of it that I created this... this moment. \n\nNew Delhi was\
  \ reeling.  The ancient city, already a cacophony of color, pungent oder and dust,\
  \ was bursting in waves of protests and marches.  More angry than the women, the\
  \ men, the fathers stood on edge ready to slander any person who dared take another\
  \ side.  All of this because of a spontaneous hate crime against a woman. \n\nThe\
  \ bus had been full of people when the young couple exited the movie theatre.  Little\
  \ by little, as pedestrians left they were left more and more vulnerable.  With\
  \ barely a word spoken between them, seven men including the bus driver waited until\
  \ they were completely alone and, driving off path struck a divisive blow.  First,\
  \ they removed the boyfriend with a crowbar to the head and a quick heave out of\
  \ the bus.  Then helpless, they descended upon the woman, violating her in every\
  \ way possible before inflicting the lethal blow - a rape with the very same crowbar\
  \ that killed her boyfriend. \n\nAuthorities found the criminals quickly, but what\
  \ to do with them?  Several of the murderers were teenagers and the law protected\
  \ them.  And as lawmakers met in quiet courtrooms to deliberate, the streets were\
  \ set ablaze.\n\nThe sun was setting as the tuktuk dropped me off at the site of\
  \ protest, Jantar Mantar.  It was a chilly January and I wrapped my coat tight,\
  \ more for comfort than the cold.  All around, men and women of different ages and\
  \ backgrounds laid about on mattress pads draped in blankets.  Some of them were\
  \ on a hunger strike that was up to day 20.  Signs were posted and scattered.  And\
  \ I was nervous to be a part of something so vile but so necessary for change.\n\
  \nAs a blonde-haired, blue-eyed female I stood out.  Suddenly I wanted to give the\
  \ grieving an outlet - to be a bigger than a witness. When a man approached me and\
  \ asked why I was there, I fibbed and told him I was a journalist on assignment.\
  \  A line formed; more men than women, and the opposition gathered too.  Spit flew\
  \ between a man defending his daughter's future and a police officer.  \n\nThe crowds\
  \ arose to form a circle, my camera the center - shoving against the opposition\
  \ as a mob. I never imagined my choice to tell a story would lead to violence. On\
  \ the edge, with all my power, I ended the fight with words; later publishing his\
  \ story.  His voice."
