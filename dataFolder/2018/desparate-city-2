Text: "Goma,DRC\n Slowly i leaves Rubavu-Gisenyi border as i enter this country from\
  \ Rwanda, Actually i choose to spend my semester break here to learn and familiarize\
  \ how things goes in other countries we share a common name \"Third world\". am\
  \ from Tanzania and my life in the third world economy is familiar every undesirable\
  \ quality of hunger, corruption, poverty political unrest and any one you can think\
  \ of fit well in our third world, yet i came to learn here ? surely there is something\
  \ more.\nThe city engulfed with both man made and natural disaster forms a best\
  \ hysteria  of panic among the peoples, there in city horizon stand tall, mighty\
  \ and beautiful nyiragongo mountain a volcano giant attract every eye of visitor\
  \ and indigenous, yet the beautiful giant was a monster vows to destroy all flesh\
  \ in the city . its record of killing threat is not a bluffing it actually massacred\
  \ several time in history the last being 2002 where it leaves  untold sorrow and\
  \ damage through out the city. Now more than ever it was clear to repeat its ritual\
  \ vent full of grayish smoke in top of mountain was clearly seen as it darken sky\
  \ above it, posts all around the cities written in french and  vernaculars warns\
  \ and instruct of how to flee in case eruption of volcano occurs. \nsometime\" mazuku\"\
  \  a very poisonous gas was recorded killing as many children s and live stocks\
  \ Apocalypse was near for the city!\nYet another political unrest and civil war\
  \ all around suburbs of city was another  man made problem causing chaos, poverty\
  \ ,and loose of hope not only hear in Goma but all around DRC, situation was tense,\
  \ panic every where and economy halt.these hysteria combination of natural and man\
  \ made problem was A decisions that push me to the limit. why media are silent?\
  \ why UN agencies and NGOs are silent here.\nA city with over 700,000 was in a blink\
  \ if not at its extinction! but no one was aware of! \n\"I will report to every\
  \ chance i got\" i thought, for many thing happen without information would have\
  \ been prevented."
