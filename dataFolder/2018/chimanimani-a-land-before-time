Text: "I am including an excerpt from a published story- \n\nIt has been a little\
  \ over a year since I was standing in the vast green valley surrounded by white\
  \ quartzite boulders as far as the eye can see; it has been a little over a year\
  \ since I was living in one of the most remote locations imaginable- Chimanimani\
  \ National Park, Zimbabwe. Two summers in a row I was blessed to witness the pristine\
  \ remoteness of this exotic landscape, but this summer I visited the park through\
  \ photos and the film I helped to create, Uncharted Lines. Of all the locations\
  \ shot for the film, this one dominated in terms of beauty, quality, adventure,\
  \ fear, and possibility. A country not often visited or thought of by American travelers,\
  \ Zimbabwe should be added to the bucket list of anyone desiring to step back in\
  \ time and step deep in to nature. Most of the country seems untouched by time,\
  \ with thousands of people living in huts without electricity or running water and\
  \ safari animals roaming the countryside; it is unlike any place I had ever witnessed.\n\
  \nZimbabwe is not a country for the faint of heart, even in the largest cities you\
  \ will not be greeted by 5 star hotels and black tie service, rather, you will be\
  \ faced with banks that run out of cash even with the limit of $100 in withdrawals\
  \ per day, fast food as the only dining option on certain nights, and people constantly\
  \ trying to sell you things or extort money from your pockets. In a country that\
  \ is predominately poor, unemployed and black, white, decently dressed people have\
  \ a target on their backs. But for all that is \u201Cdifficult\u201D about Zimbabwe,\
  \ it is by far one of the most incredible places I have ever been in my life; full\
  \ of kind, inquisitive people, exotic, beautiful animals, and heart stopping uninhabited\
  \ landscapes. \n\nAs the primary cinematographer and co-director of Uncharted Lines,\
  \ I accompanied the two climbers of the Zimbabwe portion of the film, Jimmy Webb\
  \ and Paul Robinson, to Chimanimani National Park in order to find and establish\
  \ a variety of new boulders. Our group was accompanied by another videographer,\
  \ Maxwell Frank, a photographer, Christian Adams, and  Derrick Starling, one of\
  \ the only rock climbers in Zimbabwe whom Paul and I had met during our first trip.\
  \ Derrick, who was fortunate enough to be introduced to rock climbing by his high\
  \ school teacher, was the proud owner of the only climbing wall in Zimbabwe."
