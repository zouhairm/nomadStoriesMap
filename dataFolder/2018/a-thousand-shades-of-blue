Text: "\"Your hair is blue!\" The little girl's voice sparkled as she picked out a\
  \ strand. \"I love blue!\" I looked up from my drawing, scribbled in dry marker.\n\
  \u201CYeah?\u201D I replied as she twisted the streaks into a crown around my head.\
  \ \u201CMe too!\u201D \n When I landed in Fiji, I was enveloped in world of blue.\
  \ There weren\u2019t enough words for the shades that painted Somosomo: a remote\
  \ atoll in the Yasawa chain. The sky shone a clean, crisp cerulean. The students\u2019\
  \ uniforms were a stately navy. The school, with rust-pitted roof and peeling periwinkle\
  \ paint, lacked AC, running water, or mosquito screens; barely big enough to fit\
  \ one grade. So, classes took place in the field outside. \nThe goal had been to\
  \ give a conservation presentation to the island\u2019s fourth graders. Together,\
  \ we knelt in sulus, as though gathering for a Kava ceremony, sketching seascapes.\
  \ Children and volunteers alike crawled over one another, laughing, reaching for\
  \ the perfect marker, like newborn sea turtles scrambling into the tide. It\u2019\
  s strange to find peace in such chaos. The students\u2019 English was impeccable,\
  \ but they wanted to learn to count to ten in Spanish. We asked students to draw\
  \ their favorite corals and sea animals, and brought a picture of a dead reef to\
  \ show the consequences of unsustainable practices. In the flurry, someone misplaced\
  \ our photo. I realized we\u2019d nothing to teach them besides the pronunciation\
  \ of uno, dos, tres.     \nOutside, the ocean was a cool mosaic, ever-shifting,\
  \ connecting island to island, people to people, for centuries Yet for all Somosomo\u2019\
  s beaches, it was no paradise. As commercial fishing presence in Fiji grows, less\
  \ food remains to be harvested by small communities. The scarcer fish become, the\
  \ more people turn to dangerous measures. Poisons had turned the bay to a wasteland.\
  \ Yet hope remained. People gathered annually to plant baby coral, nurturing them\
  \ to grow beautiful as their predecessors. Just as there was a new generation of\
  \ coral, a new generation of islanders was sprouting. Bored with my hair, the girl\
  \ asked, \u201CWould you draw me a manta?\u201D \nI traced the gentle curves of\
  \ its fins, dotting the eyes of its smiley face. She nodded, though her lips pursed.\
  \ \u201CThey haven\u2019t visited this year,\u201D she said mournfully.\n\u201C\
  What happened?\u201D \n\u201CPeople stopped listening.\u201D She stretched a skinny\
  \ arm for a pen, finishing the crooked points of a starfish. \u201CBut you know,\u201D\
  \ she whispered. \u201CI can hear them. They say: love us, because we are your friends,\
  \ and we\u2019ll show you the way.\u201D"
