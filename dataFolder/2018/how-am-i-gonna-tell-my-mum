Text: "To start a story as if it were a joke may not be really encouraging. But if\
  \ we all laughed at the end I can risk the typical: it was a South Korean, a Chinese,\
  \ a Japanese and a Portuguese in a jeep on the the way to the Jordanian desert.\n\
  \nThat morning everything was lined up to run as planned: catch the bus that would\
  \ take me from Petra to an accommodation in the middle of Wadi Rum, the best known\
  \ Jordanian desert, and spend a night sleeping under the stars. \n\nWhen in the\
  \ middle of the trip we are told that the journey from there would be made by jeep\
  \ we didn\u2019t question. But a stop at the driver\u2019s home where I found myself\
  \ among my new Western friends eating crackers and drinking tea waiting for a new\
  \ vehicle, this time due to an encouraging battery problems begin to seem all but\
  \ a crossing in the desert.\n\nThe new driver doesn't speak English. We follow for\
  \ hours of immense heat, thousand turns, half a dozen \"points of interest\" and\
  \ here we are dumped in a tent in the middle of nowhere, drowned in more tea. I've\
  \ seen ads accommodation at all true to reality, but this was the pinnacle.\n\n\
  While the South Korean and the Chinese seemed perfectly installed, I asked to call\
  \ the head of the bus that had brought us from Petra. No one spoke English, but\
  \ phone is a more or less universal concept. I was told that there had been conflicts\
  \ in the Israeli embassy and, therefore, the road to the desert had been closed\
  \ to tourists protection. But our cicerones did not want to lose money and \"offered\
  \ us\" a guided tour of secondary roads. Should I be grateful to them for something\
  \ I did not ask, of which I was not informed? Thank you, but I want to go back to\
  \ the village.\n\nEndless hours later, the driver of the accommodation where I had\
  \ appointed arrived to take me away. A few more minutes of insistence to take the\
  \ Japanese, who did not knew what he was doing there either. Along the way, the\
  \ option: do we want to stay at my house tonight? We looked at each other and the\
  \ only thing we knew was that we did not want to give up on our adventure in the\
  \ desert.\n\nWe ended in a Jordanian Desert Bedouin home, me dancing with the girls,\
  \ the Japanese playing football with the boys. Using technologies to understand\
  \ the traditions of each other,  eating on the ground, with our hand, the youngest\
  \ in my legs. Two makeshift beds in the yard floor. And before we surrender to sleep\
  \ with that starry sky above our heads, thousands of kilometers from home: \"how\
  \ am I gonna tell this to my mum?\"."
