Text: "After 4 hours trudging away in the local bus, I had finally arrived in the\
  \ mystical valley of Kashmir. In Kashmir, there is an aura of raw natural beauty\
  \ throughout the valley. Be it the mountains, the river, the meadows or the young\
  \ girls plucking away cherries in the fields. You just feel very close to nature.\
  \ I know Switzerland and other places in Europe provide similar views and closeness\
  \ to nature having experienced in personally, but in Kashmir it\u2019s different.\
  \ Everything is not very structured and ordered. Sometimes there is not or little\
  \ roads, the houses are small, mud houses, and you kind of step back hundred years\
  \ or so. The place has its chutzpah!\n\nThe same goes with people. I was hiking\
  \ to the top of the mountain through the Jhelum Valley when the arduous hike made\
  \ a thirsty all of a sudden. I had to ask the girl in the house closest to me for\
  \ water and that\u2019s when I struck an interesting conversation with her. Despite\
  \ the gender-divide in Pakistani community, here we were, two youth from opposite\
  \ sex and different cities talking about life. She talked about her hardships, about\
  \ her dreams and her passions. They were surprisingly quite opposite to mine. While\
  \ I yearned for a house to spend weeks and months in this beautiful valley, she\
  \ yearned to see the big cities, the flashy cars, the skyscrapers and the hustle\
  \ bustle of Lahore and Karachi. She had no make-up on, her clothes were simple,\
  \ maybe torn in places, yet she had that raw natural beauty about her which I hadn\u2019\
  t seen before. Life was so simple for these people. They woke up in the morning,\
  \ went to school, tended to their farms, had lunch and dinner with the family and\
  \ slept. The entertainment was wandering in the forests and seeing the sunsets in\
  \ the valley every day, but what more can you need? The food was fresh, organic\
  \ and free from any additives. For me, she was living the dream, and for her I was!\
  \ That day I realized how everything in the world is relative. There\u2019s no right\
  \ or wrong except for absolute morality which is same everywhere in the world. You\
  \ do not steal, you do not rape, you don\u2019t kill and you respect the other\u2019\
  s ideas, perspectives and beliefs. And if one can learn to that, one can go on to\
  \ live a content life. The lesson which an ordinary farm girl from Kashmir taught\
  \ me and which Karachi, Lahore, Paris, Frankfurt or Strasbourg couldn\u2019t. That\u2019\
  s why my friend, it\u2019s very important to travel!"
