Text: "\u201CA 250 Euro return flight from Amsterdam to Peru? Whatever is the timing\
  \ I\u2019m going there\u201D, I decided. For years I had worked to fulfill someone\
  \ else\u2019s dream and I could not find the way out of that \u201Ccursed\u201D\
  \ circle. I bought the flight tickets spontaneously, and I was not expecting this\
  \ to be a life-changing journey. I did not plan to reveal the secrets of Indian\
  \ shamans, neither did I thought that a five-day hike to Machu Picchu will be so\
  \ demanding. Yet life had a big surprise for me.\n\nIn Peru, I fell into a carousel\
  \ of experiences that changed everything. I came to the colonial city Iquitos in\
  \ the middle of the Amazonian jungle. It is a surreal place, where you can get only\
  \ by plane or boat. Looking for even more of authenticity I moved 200 kilometers\
  \ (124 miles) upstream to a small village called Jenaro Hererra. Here I was destined\
  \ to meet the local shaman Don Luco.\n\nLuco was a smiling man with a big golden\
  \ necklace around his neck. A big cross on the necklace and some gold teeth in his\
  \ mouth made his appearance even more unusual. It was not what I thought \u201C\
  a proper Amazonian shaman\u201D should look like. Yet, Don Luco was actually a man\
  \ with a bright and open heart and a great sense of humor. He introduced me to his\
  \ family, welcomed me into his home and gave me something that touched me in my\
  \ very root. I took part in the ancient ceremony that is believed to expand consciousness.\
  \ This opened a whole new world in front of my eyes. It wasn\u2019t an easy or pleasant\
  \ experience. Yet it was a deeply personal one. Today when I watch my travel videos\
  \ I see two different men before and after I visited this magic place.\n\nThe village\
  \ and everyday\u2019s life there were very simple. Yet this authentic simplicity\
  \ and people living according to nature were life itself.\n\nAfter my jungle trip,\
  \ I moved to Peruvian Andes. The five-day hike to Machu Picchu on the Salkantay\
  \ trek was not anymore merely a trip. It was a pilgrimage of my whole life condensed\
  \ in a short, amazing but challenging adventure.\n\nAlso, the last trip to the famous\
  \ Rainbow Mountain was the hardest one I have ever done. The altitude of more than\
  \ 5,000 meters (16,400 feet) almost literally killed me. Yet I got to the top. The\
  \ sun lit its light on the gorgeous multicolored mountain. At that moment I understood\
  \ that we can reach whatever we want in our lives. And even if we think that we\
  \ don't know what we want, life has its own ways to give us exactly what we need."
