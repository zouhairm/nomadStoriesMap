Text: "Standing alone late April afternoon in Istanbul's Sultanahmet Arkeolojik Park,\
  \ facing the city's distinctive Sultan Ahmet (Blue) Mosque, one cannot escape the\
  \ stimulation of senses. The low hum of the city as the faithful are called to 'Asr.\
  \ Smoke, of roasted chestnuts and corn, drifting gently across the park, tingling\
  \ the nostrils. The relentless sun beating upon the back; both comforting and threatening.\n\
  \nFrom where I stand, observing the majesty of the mosque made all the more imposing\
  \ by one's sense of awe, a man beckons me. Cautious, though na\xEFve, I follow.\
  \ The stranger asks, \"where are you from?\"\n\"New Zealand\" \u2014 as if my accent\
  \ isn't a dead giveaway.\n\"Kia ora,\" he says. \"That means we must be friends.\"\
  \n\"Kia ora,\" I say.\nThough our forbears may have fought one another on the beaches\
  \ of Gallipoli, a natural bond between Turks and Kiwis has grown. This is not my\
  \ first such encounter. The stranger asks me to follow. I do.\n\nDescending from\
  \ the tourist haven on the hill, I follow this man through old market streets \u2014\
  \ trusting blindly \u2014 as a history lesson ensues. \"This is the real Istanbul,\"\
  \ I am told. Nor do I doubt it. Before long, even the old market is behind us as\
  \ I sit drinking tea with my stranger (calling himself 'Mark') and three compatriots\
  \ of his. Turks are keen to talk politics, it seems. Even with strangers. But am\
  \ I a stranger anymore? No more do I feel like one, and never have I been treated\
  \ like one. Of course, my wariness cannot be shaken \u2014 for good reason, given\
  \ my later experiences in the city. But, I think to myself, no more authentic experience\
  \ will be found on the hill above, amongst British tourists and shameless retailers\
  \ of 'Istanbul' branded t-shirts. No. Few stories of the path well worn are worth\
  \ reading.\n\nThey call Istanbul the city where East and West collide. Collide,\
  \ maybe. But this word conjures up \u2014 unavoidably \u2014 images of friction,\
  \ tension, and antagonism. I won't lie, these exist in an abundance in no city more\
  \ than Istanbul. Nonetheless, to use this term overlooks the city's greater beauty:\
  \ its ability to be both Western and Eastern, Asian and European, modern and historic.\
  \ No, Istanbul is a city where two cultures, so frequently at odds with one another,\
  \ blend. \"Kia ora,\" I say, \"a mihi koe.\" Here is a city where no wall exists\
  \ between cultures. We are all one, though unique.\n\nBut I won't be back. There's\
  \ no need to return. Not yet, at least: the sensations were unforgettable."
