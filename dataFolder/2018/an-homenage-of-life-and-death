Text: "I left all of my childsh fears while stepping inside in what it's supposed\
  \ to be the household of all the ghosts that nutrished my nightmares: The \"Cementerio\
  \ Central\" in Bogot\xE1, Colombia . As I glanced at the perfectly sculptured feathers\
  \ of the angels that fostered the entry, a couple of young lovers joined me on my\
  \ path searching for courage to contemplate the grand thombstones that touched the\
  \ sky.\nThe sunrays layed in the magnificent busts that portrayed the spirits of\
  \ the fathers of the nation, but the shadows led us to meet the less fortuntae souls\
  \ that in Colony times couldn't afford more embelished graves that embraced all\
  \ of their struggles in life. Although, the dead flowers that rested over their\
  \ identities gave them the peace they needed as they tell them that they are still\
  \ remembered.\nThe early night started to arrive as I listen to the lessons grandmothers\
  \ and grandfathers told to the teenagers that joined me; Their hands hold eachother\
  \ harder as we got closer to graves of lovers that were lucky enough to be buried\
  \ together; the smell of dying roses, the ashes and the whispers of thousands of\
  \ people that beg us to get near their new homes to hear their stories give us the\
  \ message that we coudn't waste more time.\nThw walls that clsed the blssed skyscrapers\
  \ hold the newest souls that entered that never ending sleep; stickersand football\
  \ shields replaced the gold icrustations that decorated the wealthiest family mausoleums.\
  \ \nAt the back, the unknowns souls of the victims of that civil war looked waited\
  \ for us to tell them that finally that wished peace was finally part of this world.\
  \ \nAs I said goodbye to the last remarkable characters that holded Bogot\xE1's\
  \ story, the great door that separetes the world of today, of high buildings and\
  \ that never ending sound of cars, and the other world, where nostalgia embraces\
  \ the ancestors of the nearly 9 million people that feed the capital, showed me\
  \ the most unexpected scenario, in the place where stories end, new life stories\
  \ have just began. A diamond ring appeared over the girl face as she kissed her\
  \ lover to start the jourey between life and death called love."
