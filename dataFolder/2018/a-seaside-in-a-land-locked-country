Text: "We pulled into the station back at the capital Tashkent, and emerged from the\
  \ overnight soviet train from Bukhara somewhat sleep deprived, and having been baked\
  \ in a sleeper carriage at 28 degrees for eight hours. \n\nNearing the end of our\
  \ trip, we wanted to go into up into the Uzbek mountains which were supposed to\
  \ be beautiful, as a contrast to our Silk Road city explorations, but it was proving\
  \ difficult. As a local holiday destination, and not a tourist one, and there was\
  \ little provision for foreign visitors.\n \nThe Uzbekistan government insists on\
  \ knowing where you are at all times, and you have to document when you book into\
  \ somewhere, and when you book out. You need a slip from every location - they can\
  \ be checked.\n \nI had read that Tashkent was an ugly city, but it is very far\
  \ from that. Wide European style boulevards edged with plane trees are dotted with\
  \ some rather spectacular buildings. Museums, parks and concert halls, top international\
  \ hotels and government offices are all quite grand. It\u2019s not a crowded city,\
  \ there is much space and light, and everything is super clean.\n \nFrustrated in\
  \ our efforts to book a hotel in the mountains, we decided to go up there for the\
  \ day instead in a local taxi. Happily, Uzbekistan taxis are about the cheapest\
  \ in the world!\n\nAbout an hour and a half from Tashkent, after having travelled\
  \ through a landscape which looks rather like Southern Europe, with lush fields\
  \ of melons and cotton and vines, we wound our way up the road to the Chimgan Mountains.\
  \ Our driver couldn't speak English, so when we rounded the corner and saw the amazing\
  \ turquoise Charvak reservoir close to the border of Kyrgyzstan, it was a indeed\
  \ the last thing I expected.\n\nUzbekistan is a land locked country \u2013 so to\
  \ find a beach resort here was a bit of a shock! A large dam has created a huge\
  \ body of water which the Uzbeks have turned into a kind of summer resort with a\
  \ beach and rows of Topchans (a sort of large couch with cushions) for families\
  \ to lounge about in.  We took a ride on a beautiful speedboat with white leather\
  \ seats, across the water out into the dazzling blue day. I loved it, whizzing along\
  \ at speed with the wind in my hair, I felt elated. Uzbekistan is a destination\
  \ of constant surprises.\n\nOur fabulous trip to this fascinating country was coming\
  \ to a close. The Uzbek people are charming and the sites along the famous silk\
  \ route are amazing. Finding a beach resort in land locked country was perhaps the\
  \ most surprising thing of all."
