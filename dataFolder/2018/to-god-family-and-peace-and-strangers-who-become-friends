Text: "\u201CWould you like to see our village?\u201D Aleksandre asks me modestly\
  \ as the car leaves the outskirts of Tbilisi where he picked me up to give me a\
  \ lift.\n\nIn less the an hour I found myself greeting his wife Lorena and their\
  \ 6 year old daughter Nana as if we were old friends.\n\nAs Lorena excuses herself\
  \ into the kitchen, Aleksandre proudly offers me a tour of the village. Having met\
  \ Aleksandre\u2019s parents and neighbors, having seen the winery and the field\
  \ we come back to the garden. Nana is helping her mother to set the table. We sit\
  \ down under an old apple tree as Lorena invites us to try her home made khinkhali\
  \ \u2013 traditional dumplings that should be eaten with hands. Aleksandre proudly\
  \ explains that the more layers the dumpling has, the better the housewife is. Nana\
  \ gives me a huge smile as I struggle with the dumpling, trying not to burn my hand\
  \ with the hot liquid.\n\nNeither Aleksandre\u2019s family, nor I speak the same\
  \ language well. We laugh at each other\u2019s limited Russian vocabulary as we\
  \ try to make a toast. But when it comes to the toast it is not time to joke around.\
  \ \n\n\u201CTamada\u201D is a Georgian word for a toastmaster as the country of\
  \ 8000 year tradition in producing wine has a very particular convention of drinking\
  \ it too. We raise our glasses of homemade wine to God and family. We thank our\
  \ ancestors and think about those who passed away. \n\n\u201CTo our beautiful countries\
  \ to live in peace and no more conflicts in our land\u201D Aleksandre says slowly,\
  \ his voice lowered as his thoughts are drifting someplace else. Working in the\
  \ military he knows well what peace means. \n\nOn the way to his house we passed\
  \ by an entire field of small houses. Far away from the road it seemed like a new\
  \ district of middle class houses with nothing surrounding them. \n\n\u201CThe houses\
  \ for the refugees from South Ossetia and Abkhasia\u201D, - Alexander explained\
  \ without turning his head, as we slowly left the settlement behind. \n\nBack to\
  \ the calm little village with curious neighbors passing by for the fifth time,\
  \ a toast to peace is something not to be forgotten. As the day passes by we learn\
  \ to understand each other better. Encouraged to make a toast myself I can only\
  \ think of one word: friendship. \n\n\u201CWhen a guest comes to our home, god comes\
  \ to our home\u201D - Aleksandre mentions the Georgian proverb as we say our goodbyes.\
  \ I leave the family home knowing our paths won\u2019t probably cross again. Yet\
  \ the connection remains."
