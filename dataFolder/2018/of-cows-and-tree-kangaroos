Text: "I knew that the visit was a bad idea as I indicated up the farm drive. Foreboding\
  \ gripped, and my instinct was to leave. This was the last dairy of my tour, and\
  \ I had to attend.\n\nBeneath the crushing heat of the Australian spring cows battled\
  \ flies and ponderously made their way to the robotic parlour to be milked. The\
  \ farmer  complained as he walked around the tail- swishing cows.\n\n\u201CPeople\
  \ here have no connection with the land, no idea where food comes from.\u201D\n\n\
  A group of elderly people arrived for a talk, and I sat down, avoiding his gaze,\
  \ which raised hairs along the length of my arms. The barn was dark after the glare\
  \ of the sun, and he spoke of a changing world, of victimhood, of fighting the system,\
  \ as a machine attached clusters to a cow\u2019s teats, and grain swept down a chute\
  \ to her head.\n\nI left as soon as I could, my notebook full of numbers and quotes,\
  \ fingers itching to turn the key in the ignition of my hired car. \n\nGrass, burning\
  \ brown, stretched to the horizon on either side of the drive. A pond, still full\
  \ from the winter rain, was shaded by a gum trees. A white crane disturbed the smooth\
  \ surface of the water, rising like a ghost into the blue sky. \n\nMy destination\
  \ was McDonald\u2019s; that safe space of potato fries and soft scoop ice cream.\
  \ \n\nThe familiarity of the McFlurry contrasted with the notes of rural Queensland;\
  \ droughts, and snake bites, and the brush of a checked shirt sleeve across a forehead\
  \ red and sweaty. \n\nEarlier I had been in the Tablelands, where the rivers house\
  \ crocodiles and the locals build against the forces of cyclones. Away from the\
  \ banana groves and sugar cane, black and white cows grazed stalky grass and made\
  \ milk in the glow of the tropical sun. It was a glimpse of Eden; a paradise of\
  \ rainbow birds, cascading waterfalls and primal lushness.\n\nThere an Aboriginal\
  \ guide led me into the trees, where the feline face of a tree kangaroo peered out\
  \ of the canopy.  My guide watched me in silence punctuated by brush turkeys scratching\
  \ leaf litter, pademelons dashing across the forest path. When I thanked him he\
  \ turned quietly in the dappled sunshine and said;\n\n\u201CIt was worth it to see\
  \ a smile like that.\u201D\n\nThe animal stretched across its bough, and I felt\
  \ a swell of gratitude.\n\nAt the McDonalds my phone pinged, two phrases prominent;\
  \ intensely attracted and stay the night. The ice cream was rancid in my mouth,\
  \ and I thought of the kindly guide, who showed me everything and asked for nothing\
  \ but a shared joy in a rare macropod."
