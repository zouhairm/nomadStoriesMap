  \ Dhruv \u2026on the other hand my wide opened eyes and a bigger opened mouth probably\
  \ scared him even more, than the elephant I was planning both of us to ride on\u2026\
  .....\nActually in the last 3 hours a lot of unplanned things have happened for\
  \ Dhruv which for me was just routine excitement. I somehow manipulated Dhruv to\
  \ accompany me on a trip to Puducherry. we were originally visiting an international\
  \ conference in Chennai, I offered him to skip the cultural evening to have a trip\
  \ to Mahabalipuram. Dhruv is someone who love to preplan his travel and know everything\
  \ beforehand about his plans... Once we finish I proposed to detour to Puducherry\
  \ . Dhruv denied on the first,  but somehow the recently found joy in visiting the\
  \ unknown had given him strength to rethink and come out of the comfort zones .we\
  \ found out how to reach Puducherry ,so we reached the highway and started waiting\
  \ for our destined ride to arrive\u2026but what a fortune for me and terror for\
  \ Dhruv that after an hour or so we found 3 majestic gigantic elephants passing\
  \ by with their respective mahawat( the master)on them. The elegant poised swinging\
  \ of trunks and fanning of ears hypnotized me and am sure weakened the pounding\
  \ heart of Dhruv filled with terror. after a bit of talking between me and the mahawat\
  \ we found ourselves seated over Ramu( the most well built amongst the three elephants)\
  \ \u201Chi.\u201DShe said nothing and just came and sat close to me, lined her sandals\
  \ along side mine. The two pairs looked like couples...Nopes came with my friend\
  \ \u2026Oh\u2026.where is she\u2026.?a..well its not what you think I I think this\
  \ replied made her smile for the first time\u2026.actually she giggled...don\u2019\
  t you ever say anything about girls gossiping infront of one you\u2019ll be in trouble\u2026\
  .I smiled and said\u2026so am I ?She asked\u201D what ?\u201D\u201CI mean so am\
  \ I in trouble now ?\u201DShe smiled and kept looking at me for sometime\u2026more\
  \ than what we have thought or planned for. The empty boat was our little cradle\
  \ where we both enjoyed some moments of \u201Cbeing cared \u201Cfeeling by keeping\
  \ our heads on each other\u2019s laps for sometimes.some cuddling .she left after\
  \ a kiss; a very pure in its kind and may be the only best after the very first\
  \ one\u2026I went back to my room with a different tickle in my heart this time.\
  \ actually i dont have enough time to edit so this is just quite incomplete.the\
  \ middle portion is almost gone & i have no time left to edit.infact this is what\
  \ i call \"the unexpected\""
