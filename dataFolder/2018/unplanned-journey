Text: "Yes,I was really down that time .I am not sure how you are going to take it\
  \ but the truth is I was once depressed that made me to do certain things . One\
  \ of such thing was travelling without telling anyone.Actually one of my friend\
  \ pushed me to this decision Though I have travelled alone some times I didn't stay\
  \ anywhere till that time.It was my first trip with a friend.we both were confident(because\
  \ I have been the victim of many cancelled trips)and booked \n tickets .We travelled\
  \ overnight by bus.we reached the hillstation by morning .We have already maDe bookings\
  \ in the hotel.From the balcony of the room where I stayed I could see the beautiful\
  \ view of the nearby forest.the climate us shiver we explored the common tourist\
  \ spots on the first day.The next day we went to trek on the nearby falls.it was\
  \ my first trek and was little nervous but we managed to do it good and  saw the\
  \ falls which was at the end of mazytrek .I managed to know little more about the\
  \ falls through my cab driver he said the falls encountered with lots of accidental\
  \ deaths.we were little scared .We went for cycling the very next day saw the wonderful\
  \ view of mountains and climate. The very next day we explored a cave which was\
  \ said dangerous too the name of the cave was devil's kitchen .He said many slipped\
  \ into the cave and dead but the bodies were not seen .Then my friend fell down\
  \ then we came back with freezed faces and slept.my friend forced me for shopping\
  \ and that hill station is famous for home made chocolates .We did few shopping\
  \ and came back to board bus .We again travelled back overnight to home.my friends\
  \ came to know this we had little fights too.but the memory was still eye opening.again\
  \ I went back to the same place as i could not cover up the few parts during that\
  \ trip.That time I travelled back with two other people.this time it was kinda more\
  \ adventurous than the last trip as we had fun times .we explored one  place by\
  \ trekking down the mountains.it was breath taking trek.we three had fun and climbed\
  \ as fast we could as panting as we could .We were sitting at the edge of cliff\
  \ and were taking photographs we shouted and checked for echo but we could not hear\
  \ it .We made fun of each other.we climbed up again had food in nearby cafe.we came\
  \ back again to college our friends were suspicious that we went with other boys\
  \ but only three know about our adventurous trip.yes it was adventurous for me !\
  \ Still I feel a strong connection with that place and it is very emotional"
