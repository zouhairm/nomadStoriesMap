Text: "The shower is rigged up under a rambling overgrown vine in the leafy garden\
  \ of our Croatian apartment.  Apart from the cool transparent sea a ten minute walk\
  \ down the cobbled street, it is our only retreat from the sweltering heat on the\
  \ island of Brac, a few miles from mainland Croatia.\n\nAs the smell of coconut\
  \ shampoo and the garlic wafting from the kitchen mix inside my nostrils, the gate\
  \ at the end of the garden clicks.  I pause my shampooing and process the potential\
  \ implications of the click.  I conclude that, without a doubt, whoever has entered\
  \ the garden will retreat, once their eyes follow their ears to the source of the\
  \ patter of water on stone. British logic at its finest: discretion and dignity\
  \ will prevail.  I take a sip of my cold white wine and resume lathering. \n \n\
  My friend and I are preparing for our dinner guests.  We have invited the apartment\
  \ owner and - because she speaks only Croatian and we speak none - her friend Gordon.\
  \ The mysterious Gordon, known only to us via messages sent back and forth through\
  \ the ether, has been our main contact since we began organising the trip. We have\
  \ relied heavily on Gordon for essential information, such as where to get the finest\
  \ caffeine hit in the morning,  the best secluded beaches for floating around the\
  \ shoreline on our lime green lilo and where to hire a quad bike to get us there.\
  \  On more than one occasion, following his advice, we have enjoyed some local Brac\
  \ activity.  I especially loved the quiet evening we stood on the harbour in the\
  \ fierce gold evening sun, watching local fishermen carve up their glistening, newly-caught\
  \ tuna on what looked like a large stone altar.   The blood ran over the edge and\
  \ down onto the hot tarmac, continuing down the side of the street.  Half an hour\
  \ later, I tasted tuna so good I would return for that alone. \n\nI rinse the coconut\
  \ lather from my hair and see a well-groomed gentleman, perhaps in his fifties,\
  \ about 5 paces away, still walking\u20262 paces\u2026one\u2026\n\u201CGood evening.\
  \  I\u2019m Gordon.  How do you do?\u201D  I shake the hand on offer.\n\u201CI\u2019\
  m Sarah.  Good evening.  A pleasure to meet you.\u201D \n\u201CCan I get you anything?\
  \  Shampoo, soap, a glass of wine\u2026\u201D\n\u201CNo, thank you, I think I have\
  \ everything.\u201D\n\u201CExcellent.  See you later then.\u201D\nGordon continues\
  \ down the path towards the apartment.  I take another sip of my cold white wine.\
  \  Discretion and dignity have, somehow, prevailed, though I am absolutely certain\
  \ it had nothing to do with anything British."
