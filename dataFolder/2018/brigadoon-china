Text: "When I told the taxi drivers outside the Luoyang train station where we wanted\
  \ to go, they glanced nervously at each other, whispered furiously, and then a lone\
  \ driver reluctantly stepped forward. We were zooming alongside the lovely Luo River,\
  \ when suddenly, the driver crossed over a bridge, and came to a stop. \u201CThis\
  \ is it,\u201D he kept saying over and over in Mandarin. But there was no hotel\
  \ in sight. Yet he was adamant, so we paid up and got out. \n\nWe were standing\
  \ there like three lost lambs when a Chinese woman rescued us. Apparently, we were\
  \ at the bottom of the hill and our hotel was on top. Had the driver only turned\
  \ the other way. So we began to gather our things for the hike, but our new friend\
  \ flagged down a mini-truck and without a word had us in the back on the way up.\n\
  \nThe hotel was beautiful, very modern, though curiously empty. And none of the\
  \ staff spoke English. We checked in and went to the bar, but the strangeness continued.\
  \ While there were bottles of wine on display, we couldn\u2019t have them. They\
  \ had no ice, and, strangely, no tea. Only room temperature beer straight from the\
  \ refrigerator. But we didn\u2019t let warm beer stop us from enjoying the magnificent\
  \ view of the Longmen Grottoes, the reason we were in this odd hotel in the first\
  \ place.\n\nThe next morning we crossed the river to see the grottoes up close.\
  \ And they are breathtaking, all 2345 caves and niches. And after an exhausting\
  \ day with Buddha, we planned on dinner at the hotel restaurant. But we\u2019d barely\
  \ entered, when a woman with a clipboard body blocked us. The restaurant was not\
  \ open! Someone was indeed in there she didn't want us to see, and she couldn\u2019\
  t eject us fast enough. \n\nSo we went for a stroll. Down a forested lane, men in\
  \ black suits stood guarding private bungalows. What had we walked into?  We hadn\u2019\
  t seen any other guests, and we made everyone nervous. I\u2019d gotten around China\
  \ with my less than fluent Mandarin for a while, but here at the Dongshan Hotel,\
  \ no one could understand me. It began to dawn on us that someone pretty high up\
  \ in the Communist Party was here. And no one was supposed to know. Least of all\
  \ three unknown Americans. \n\nThe next morning, the manager sent a car to take\
  \ us to the airport, and we could hear a collective sigh of relief as we left. At\
  \ home, I looked up the hotel again and noticed a line that I\u2019d missed: \u201C\
  a calm and luxurious atmosphere fit for the heads of state that visit from time\
  \ to time.\u201D  Timing is everything."
