Text: "I should have rented a convertible, was my thought at the sight I was facing.\
  \ When I planned my trip to Cyprus a friend advised me to rent a car with a good\
  \ A/C. It was good advice, indeed. But as I was driving my way from Paphos to Limassol\
  \ I decided to take the long road that goes by the shore instead of the motorway,\
  \ and now I was aching for a convertible so I could feel the faded rays of sun and\
  \ the warmth of the wind on my skin. I had to stop the car to take it in. Before\
  \ me stood a long winding road that started out right next to the sea and went thru\
  \ the top of the mountains ahead, turning the beach into cliffs. It was pink skies,\
  \ blue sea and white sandy mountains on an empty road. As I stood there contemplating\
  \ the view a song came to my head \u2018Take my breath away\u2019 by Berlin. It\
  \ really was, breathtaking. This might not have been a movie but it was definitely\
  \ a sight worth being in one. With that thought in mind I grabbed my iPod, connected\
  \ it to the car radio and searched for that exact song. I drove the road with the\
  \ windows rolled down singing along with the loud playing radio.I felt like a movie\
  \ star, playing goddess on the land of Aphrodite. In the exact place she was born.\
  \ Petra Tou Romiou. It was absolutely magical.I couldn\u2019t help but park the\
  \ car on the side of the road on the first mountain. I sat on the gravel on the\
  \ top of the cliff. I could see Aphrodite\u2019s rock. But in front of me it was\
  \ all sea and the setting sun. It might not have been the best place on the island\
  \ to see the sunset as it was to see the sunrise. But it didn\u2019t really matter\
  \ because you could still see the sky in all shades of red and pink. There was a\
  \ warm breeze tickling my skin. The salty smell of the water invading my lungs.\
  \ I wonder how the water would feel like. Was it cold? or was it just fresh enough?\
  \ I tried not to think, just sinking in the feeling and letting the soft sound of\
  \ the crushing waves guide my mind. I could still taste the red wine and the olive\
  \ oil I tried at Sterna early in the day. Such flavors. This was not just a mysterious\
  \ island full of history and myths, it was a place of mixed feelings and emotions.\
  \ As I looked down at the rocky beach I spotted a couple being playful by the sea.\
  \ I love to travel on my own. But sitting there, with such a magical view I wondered\
  \ how it would feel to share the silence and the breathtaking moment with someone\
  \ special like that. Maybe that is why they call it the island of love. You just\
  \ can\u2019t help the feeling."
