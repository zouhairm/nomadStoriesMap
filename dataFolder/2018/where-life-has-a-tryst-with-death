Text: "\u201CBooked!\u201D - With my cup still warm from the tea, a life changing\
  \ decision is made with a click and with the aid of a 16 digit number. I am grappling\
  \ with a lot of issues in life and in my quest for spiritual discovery, I decide\
  \ to head to Manikarnika ghat, one of the largest cremation grounds in Varanasi,\
  \ by the Ganges.\n\n\u201CThis 3,500 year old ghat was built by Lord Shiva himself.\u201D\
  , says Manav, the youngest in his dom family legacy who found me looking for a guide\
  \ in the busy city and offered his services at a nominal price. Doms are 'Untouchables'\
  \ by Hindu caste system. In the background I can hear chants of \u201CRam naam satya\
  \ hai!\u201D (God\u2019s name is the only truth). The chants are causing vibrations\
  \ in my soul. I know by now that my idea of death is going to change.\n\n\u201C\
  I have been working since the age of 4 as a shroud picker\u201D, confesses Manav.\
  \ Children in dom families start training early and while they cannot handle bigger\
  \ tasks in the pyre like lighting fire, they are trained for lower skill tasks.\
  \ \u201CI got these from picking shrouds when I was too close to the fire\u201D\
  , he says pointing to his burns. \u201CCome let me show you.\u201D\n\nI can barely\
  \ keep up with him as he scurries up the ghat\u2019s steep steps. \u201CThis is\
  \ the sacred flame that is used to set fire to all bodies\u201D. In Hindu tradition,\
  \ the deceased are set to fire. A dom provides first five logs of wood for the pyre\
  \ and hands over the lighted log to the designated person in the family of the deceased.\
  \ This flame is kept alive by the Dom Rajas - The leader of the hierarchy of Doms.\n\
  \nBack at the ghat, I sit on the stairs and take a moment to take this all in. The\
  \ sheer act of looking around is massively laborious. The entire range in sight\
  \ is a camp of lit pyres housing burning bodies, an audience for these ceremonies,\
  \ young kids nudging the logs closer to the bodies with bamboo sticks or picking\
  \ up anything that can resell. \u201CWe don't have a choice. To combat the unbearable\
  \ stench and continue working, all doms drink local whiskey.\u201D, Manav suggests.\
  \ Most dom deaths are caused by excessive drinking or smoking pot.\n\nJust as I\
  \ start to believe that I have seen it all, a young man walks past me towards the\
  \ pyre with his father\u2019s burning body and hits the skull with a bamboo beam.\
  \ \u201CNow the soul is free from the body and onto its spiritual journey in the\
  \ afterlife.\u201D A disconsolate tear streams down my face at this point and I\
  \ just close my eyes. I try to remember why I came here. Suddenly riddles of my\
  \ life seem insignificant."
