Text: "I was sixteen, I had the perfect amount of unconsciousness, I was in a new\
  \ country, a new family. I arrived in August,Buenos Aires received me with 0\xB0\
  . I began immediately to repent, when my host family occurred at the airport I was\
  \ absolutely stunned after 16 hours of flight time, at home waiting for me a pizza-carton,\
  \ I wanted to go home.   The Argentina I occurred in the best way possible, I didn't\
  \ feel confident, I felt I was missing girls every day during my first week of stay,\
  \ nothing seemed positive. Over time I tried to reach the goal, I was a 16-year-old\
  \ completely adrift and I decided to get away from home to find that he now was\
  \ gone completely lost, my inner peace. Going to the gym one afternoon a guy passed\
  \ me next in motion with a knife in your mouth ... I went home distraught. At the\
  \ beginning of each month there was always a detail that aroused my curiosity, a\
  \ long line in front of the main bank that stood right in front of my school. The\
  \ line consisted of young people, children, mothers despair; my host sister explained\
  \ that at the beginning of each month the Government was providing social plans\
  \ for the survival of all. When he uses the word survive I was shocked and I promise\
  \ that when I'd get more familiar with the place, I would take him to watch from\
  \ outside their \"homes\". They spent days, months, I began to get used to the news\
  \ of the missing girls, I began to worship the empanadas, I began to have some girlfriends,\
  \ inziai to dream in Spanish. My host sister became a fundamental guide in the year\
  \ in Argentina and as promised I brought about the \"case\" of \"the poor\".A December\
  \ afternoon when there were 40\xB0 we passed in a so called \"villas\" and actually\
  \ I saw no House, I saw properties in cardboard, mud, twigs, leaves; cramped structures\
  \ where they could \"live\" at most two people but instead to live there were much\
  \ more. There were so many \"homes\" made in the same way, there were children who\
  \ were happy with very little, parents who \"were forced\" to steal, to kill to\
  \ survive. It was a powerful experience, I was a spectator of a reality that is\
  \ completely different from mine, a reality that has opened up in me a new worldview.\
  \ I asked my sister to stop to understand even more closely the living conditions\
  \ of those people but the answer was in the negative, was too dangerous and she\
  \ decided not to take on that responsibility. We went away from that place considered\
  \ as risky but my thoughts kept on being there, I couldn't forget about it."
