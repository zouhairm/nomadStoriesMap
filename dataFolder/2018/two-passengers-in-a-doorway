Text: "Tea plantations, richly green, dotted with men and women caught in the repetitive\
  \ motion of picking leaves, rolling hills stretching off into the distance, villages\
  \ emerging around each bend lined with locals, half-looking with faces of amusement.\
  \ This is what my eager eyes are pulled over as the rickety train carries me along,\
  \ my body jolting back and forth with its jarred movements. This is the 6 hour,\
  \ cross country train ride from Ella to Kandy. This is Sri Lanka.\n\nAs my legs\
  \ dangle over the edge, thrilled to have snagged one of the few open doors from\
  \ which to perch myself and lean out into the view, I sense a body approaching and\
  \ my smile momentarily drops as a large figure slides into the doorway beside me.\
  \ Still engrossed in my own world, my new neighbour gently warns me to watch my\
  \ legs moments before our train squeezes through a tunnel of darkness. Ok, maybe\
  \ a companion isn\u2019t the worst thing I contemplate, legs safely inside. Once\
  \ back out in the open, legs dangling anew, I shift my gaze to the man beside me.\
  \ A smile plastered to his face, his large body rocking gently in time with the\
  \ train, hands calmly entwined in his lap. With myself clinging intensely to the\
  \ doorframe to prevent a feared topple onto the tracks, I smile at a possible outsiders\
  \ comparison of the two passengers in the doorway.\n\nWith my attention now altered\
  \ to my companion, he introduces himself. In broken though confident English he\
  \ proceeds to ask me about my trip and my life, interspaced with eager promises\
  \ of imminent camera worthy views and knowledge of the scenes flying past. As his\
  \ hands rise and fall with each new thought I throw in questions of my own and learn\
  \ of his world. The landscape around me, once simply an amazing vista, becomes overflown\
  \ with stories. \n\nNo deep, complex topic was broached, the wounds of Sri Lanka\u2019\
  s recent civil war remained hidden and I learnt of no enduring hardship. However,\
  \ through seemingly mundane conversation, I discovered the Sri Lanka other that\
  \ its postcard views, I encountered its people. I was reminded to look beyond the\
  \ hills and tea plantations. People shape a country\u2019s story, and although most\
  \ of them are just like you and me, and merely want some company on a long train\
  \ ride home, the world has so much more to offer if we simply look a little further.\n\
  \nA welcoming smile, stories of family life and daily commutes, the sharing of knowledge\
  \ and experiences. This is the 6 hour, cross country train ride from Ella to Kandy.\
  \ This is Sri Lanka."
