Text: "Going to Greece was on top of my bucket list since I fell in love on a picture\
  \ that I saw in a magazine.  The picture showed an isolated sandy cove with royal\
  \ blue waters, beautiful limestone cliffs, and a shipwreck (imagine Pirates of the\
  \ Caribbean). After months of research for my Greece vacation, I squeezed in a side\
  \ trip to the island of Zakynthos where the beautiful shipwreck beach (Navagio beach)\
  \ is located.  I booked the plane rides, reserved hotel accommodations, and bought\
  \ the boat tour going to Navagio beach coming from capital town of Zakynthos.  I\
  \ said to myself, \u201Cforget about Santorini,\u201D I was focused on snapping\
  \ a photo of Navagio beach. After spending three days in Athens, I flew to Zakynthos.\
  \ As our plane landed on the airport, I noticed one thing:  It was raining and the\
  \ storm appeared to be getting worse.  As soon as I checked into the hotel, I learned\
  \ that the boat tour was canceled.  It broke my heart.  I came that far for nothing.\
  \  I just stayed inside the hotel room lying in bed and stared at the ceiling for\
  \ hours.  Then I remembered I'm in Greece! I stepped out and walked around Zakynthos\
  \ town despite the rain.  Near a beach, local tour operators told me that all boat\
  \ tours were canceled. But I learned that the bus tour around the island would still\
  \ operate despite the unpredictable weather.  I booked the tour for the next day\
  \ after I successfully moved my return flight for a later time.  During the bus\
  \ tour, I met several tourists from different parts of the world and enjoyed our\
  \ conversations.  We visited local villages, churches, olive plantations but I did\
  \ not expect that we would be stopping by Navagio beach cove viewing area!  The\
  \ sun was unexpectedly shining too!  As we got off the bus, I ran towards the viewing\
  \ platform with so much excitement as I saw the beautiful blue sea against the limestone\
  \ cliffs.  The platform was crowded with a very long line and I was getting frustrated.\
  \  After many failed shots of Navagio beach, I followed a few tourists who snuck\
  \ down out of the marked area.  There, near the edge of the cliff, was the best\
  \ view of the cove!  I am terrified of heights and definitely was very nervous to\
  \ even look down. I took a deep breath and inched my way to the edge of the cliff.\
  \  Slowly, I carefully took some shots of the cove while holding firmly to a small\
  \ bush with my other hand. From there, I was able to snap my dream pictures! Of\
  \ course, I did not forget the selfies.  Destination, accomplished!"
