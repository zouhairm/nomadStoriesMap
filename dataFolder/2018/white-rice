Text: "The first time I ever saw round eyes I was already 13 months old, and they\
  \ were my mothers. I thought: \u2018\u2019does she see more than I do?\u2019\u2019\
  \n\nWhen I was born, I immediately found myself in a room with other 30 babies and\
  \ 4 young women to take care of all of us. Of course, I didn\u2019t know any other\
  \ form of living.\nYu was my main care taker. I remember how she used to sing \u201C\
  D\xE0n chim tr\xE5ng\u201D to me before going to sleep with that sweet voice of\
  \ her. Her long, straight black hair used to tickle my arm while she leant towards\
  \ me smiling and rubbing my cheek softly. \nWhite rice and milk had made my mouth\
  \ numb, but I didn\u2019t realize what tasting something actually meant until later\
  \ on, when I noticed how amazingly sensitive I was to tastes. \n\nOne day, Yu came\
  \ into the room with a red-headed short woman with big green eyes and a very tall\
  \ bearded man with brown eyes, which later started to come more and more often.\
  \ Little did I know, these people were about to change my life. I started to get\
  \ used to them. Yu, on the other hand, was slowly taking distances. She had stopped\
  \ singing songs to me before going to sleep and sometimes she would pass by, look\
  \ at me sadly and drift away. \n\nOn the 2nd of September they came again, but this\
  \ time Yu had been crying all morning and I could feel her hands trembling when\
  \ she approached me to the woman. When the two strangers took me away, I understood\
  \ I was never going to see Yu again. \nAfter 30 days of having the two strangers\
  \ taking care of me in an unknown place I had learned their names were Mamma and\
  \ Papa, when everything changed again.\nWe went through huge places with lots of\
  \ people and high ceilings and through enormous flying machines, and we got to where\
  \ we are today. \nWe finally landed in a very cold place, full of round-eyed people\
  \ driving unnecessarily big cars. \nDuring my first months there, I experienced\
  \ situations, feelings, languages and people that were absolutely new to me. As\
  \ I got to taste something different every day, my mouth cured itself from numbness\
  \ and slowly adapted to the new situation. \nSometimes I still get blown away on\
  \ how my life has flipped upside down, I wonder why I was chosen for this transition,\
  \ I ask myself what would have happened if I had stayed, I wonder where Yu is. I\
  \ was Hong, I only understood Vietnamese and I only ate white rice. Now, I\u2019\
  m Giulia. I speak 4 languages, I live in Luxembourg and I feel like there\u2019\
  s not much that would surprise my taste buds anymore, except white rice."
