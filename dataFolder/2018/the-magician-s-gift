Text: "While searching for the God, on his sacred land, all that I could find were\
  \ the magicians. One of them explained me their tricks, perhaps something that even\
  \ the God can\u2019t do, they claimed. \n\nAs I entered inside, the crowd drifted\
  \ me towards one of the shrines. I joined the queue where devotees were waiting\
  \ for their turn to obtain the God\u2019s blessings. When I confronted the statue,\
  \ all I could see was brocade, covering the expensive metals structured as a human,\
  \ decorated with expensive gems reflecting the light to all over the cella.\n\n\u2018\
  Hare Krishna! Krishna Krishna Hare Hare!\u201D \n\nI attuned all my emotions and\
  \ questions with this hymn and placed them before Krishna but all I received was\
  \ unsatisfied curiosity. How a man-made creation would answer me about the creator\
  \ of man?.\n\nThousands of worshippers dressed differently and hundreds of flags\
  \ on the top point (Kalash) act like a frame to this amber painted temple land.\
  \ Amidst the claps, beating drums, loud hymns and the people circling around the\
  \ temple, I had a glimpse of this magician or Pandit who was wearing saffron cloth;\
  \ its one end was tied around his waist and other was placed behind the back, crossing\
  \ his chest. It wasn\u2019t more than a minute when this Pandit was standing next\
  \ to me holding my palm and studying my future. \n\nHe told me that he knows a trick\
  \ that can cure all my problems and fulfill my wishes. \n\n\u201CBut for that, we\
  \ have God?\u201D I asked innocently to which he answered, \u201CGod can\u2019t\
  \ look after everyone and so we are here for that. You just need to pay whatever\
  \ amount you wish and then we will do the chants to send your message to him.\u201D\
  \n\n\u201COK! But he won\u2019t ask me to pay him to fulfill my wishes?\u201D He\
  \ looked at me in disguise, pushed me aside and made his way to other devotees.\
  \ \n\nBut unknowingly the magicians gave me the answer. We use God as a medium to\
  \ satisfy our greed and overcoming our fear, someone whom we can ask for our wants\
  \ and someone who could save us. But all I learned that true god doesn\u2019t lie\
  \ inside any statues but within us. Salvation is something that one can only achieve\
  \ if he takes responsibility for his every emotion rather than burdening it down\
  \ on the God, toils for his goals and controls his avarice. \n\nAt Dwarkadhish temple,\
  \ at a place of immortal belief, these mortal men claim to give life to my every\
  \ wish. My wish has existence because of me and so my God. And if this story reaches\
  \ everyone, my wish will be fulfilled and it will be my one step towards my salvation."
