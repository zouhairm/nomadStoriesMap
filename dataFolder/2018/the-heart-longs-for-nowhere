Text: "I didn\u2019t want to come home. The colors were too bright. People too kind.\
  \ Landscape too beautiful. It HURT to get back on that plane, surrounded by my now\
  \ even more beloved \u201CGives Back\u201D crew. Ghana is stunning in a punch-you-in-the-heart-and-suck-the-wind-out-of-you\
  \ kind of way.\n\nEquatorial heat wrapped around us all week, melting defenses,\
  \ weakening barriers. This country and her hugging, welcoming, WARM people have\
  \ broken me. I want to go back. I want to feel that toothless brown woman\u2019\
  s arms around me, laughing in the middle of a rutted road, surrounded by lush wilderness,\
  \ guileless children tittering at our feet. I want to walk to the well with its\
  \ chilly pump handle, my toes covered in ochre silt. I ache to feel that water splashing\
  \ down my back as those children laugh at my ineptitude in balancing a cracked plastic\
  \ bucket of it on my head.\n\nI want to navigate the smoggy streets of Accra in\
  \ a rickety turquoise trotro, \u201Cthe van\u201D to our little group, eagerly leaning\
  \ out its windows to buy icy FanMilk froyo from street vendors hawking wares from\
  \ atop their heads. Everything from dried fish to dish soap...a spectacle to us.\
  \ A life to them.\n\nI want to watch Ebow\u2019s sinewy muscles work cool gray cement\
  \ onto the walls of the computer lab we helped to build. I long to hear him laugh\
  \ again, see him dance, finally, after a week of my cajoling, teasing and unabashed\
  \ love being tossed his way.\n\nOh, to bathe once more in the turgid waters of Boti\
  \ Falls, those twin cascades majestic and threatening as we let their cool mist\
  \ spread smiles on our faces, unity in our hearts...to again be on that slippery\
  \ rock to which we swam and then sat still, quiet, content.\n\nI hunger to climb\
  \ a shaky ladder of fallen wood to the top of Umbrella Rock. I long to sit on the\
  \ edge of that precipice, feet dangling and soul soaring above an expansive green\
  \ jungle stretched in front of me. I want Felix, Benjamin and Tina; Francis, Godfrey\
  \ and Steven; those beautiful Ghanaians. I want them there next to me.\n\nAnd I\
  \ want those joy-filled children in their yellow open-air classroom, waving new\
  \ notebooks in gratitude and goodbye...I want them to know that I love them. That\
  \ their smiles are in my heart, in my tears that now fall. That the soccer match\
  \ we played with them on a tattered green field in the middle of nowhere, Asampaneye,\
  \ Ghana, Africa - it lives within me. That I feel that heat. See their faces. That\
  \ they and their country are a part of me. They are mine and I am theirs. Now. Always."
