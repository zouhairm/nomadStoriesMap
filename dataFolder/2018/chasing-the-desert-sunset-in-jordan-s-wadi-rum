Text: "Our driver, Mahmoud, races through the red desert sand of Wadi Rum, the yellow\
  \ sun low in the sky in front of us. My boys scream with glee as we bounce and bump\
  \ on padded benches attached to the bed of Mahmoud\u2019s Toyota 4x4. Only a few\
  \ hundred lucky visitors watch a Wadi Rum sunset each night; it is something we\
  \ are about to experience.\n\nWe approach a few parked trucks and see about two\
  \ dozen people climbing up a red sandstone mountain to watch the yellow ball of\
  \ fire touch the horizon in front of us. \u201CWe must be here,\u201D I thought,\
  \ but Mahmoud does not stop. Around the mountain we go, racing as fast as the four\
  \ wheel drive tires will go, on the soft desert sand, the golden light casting long\
  \ shadows across the empty desert.\n\nSuddenly, Mahmoud hits the breaks and the\
  \ Toyota slides to a stop. We clamber off the bolted down benches and over the back\
  \ of the truck, our bare feet landing in the sun-warmed sand.\n\n\u201CWe have to\
  \ hurry,\u201D Mahmoud beckons, as the yellow ball of fire threatens to touch the\
  \ horizon. The boys needed no more encouragement and were off, quickly scrambling\
  \ up the sandstone mountain straight to the top. I tried not to hold my breath as\
  \ I watched them run along sections that were no more that 8 feet wide. A slip or\
  \ a fall could mean they would tumble, fifty feet or more off the edge. \n\nI followed\
  \ Mahmoud and the boys up the hill, my gaze turned left and right at the panoramic\
  \ views all around me, the golden light reflecting off the jagged sandstone mountains,\
  \ the blue sky darkening as dusk approached. We reached the top and climbed into\
  \ a tucked away crevice, shielding us from the cool evening breeze. My boys sat\
  \ close to Mahmoud, happy to enjoy his company for this moment. I sat still as the\
  \ sun touched the hills and watched as it quickly disappeared behind the mountains\
  \ of Wadi Rum, not to be seen again until morning. Dusk fell on the desert, and\
  \ the sense of vastness of the valley, known to many as the Valley of the Moon,\
  \ caused a sense of quiet reflection inside of me. How lucky I was to be here, on\
  \ top of this small sandstone hill, watching the end of a day, and anticipating\
  \ what tomorrow would bring.\n\nThe boys, eager to play, brought me out of my quiet\
  \ place, back to reality as they gleefully played atop the sandstone mountain. It\
  \ was getting dark, time to return to camp and enjoy a hot cup of the aromatic,\
  \ sweet bedouin tea and gaze up at the vast starry sky, before climbing into our\
  \ tents until morning."
