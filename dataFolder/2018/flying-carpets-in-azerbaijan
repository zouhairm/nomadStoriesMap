Text: "This story is not about the magical Aladdin Lamp. However, there are other\
  \ kind of wonders all around Azerbaijan: the land where you can find thousands of\
  \ patterned carpets hanging on the walls of local houses. Once upon a time (which\
  \ is few years ago) there lived a Lithuanian girl (which is me) who had never imagined\
  \ her climbing Caucasus mountains (which I did 5 times), volunteering in English\
  \ teaching for Azerbaijani kids and dancing in Baku European Games on the same stage\
  \ with Lady Gaga and John Newman.\nCoincidence is honey, so I am exploring crazy\
  \ bubbling mud volcanoes in Gobustan National Park when the girly voice welcomes\
  \ me to join for a movie. Here I am in my traveler boots being introduced to a director\
  \ of English school and offered to give my first class. All boys sit on the left\
  \ and girls on the right. They are shy to interact with each other. 4 months pass\
  \ as 4 days and in the last lesson everybody is brave enough not only to express\
  \ their opinions, but also to go after their most desired dreams. It becomes natural\
  \ for the boys and girls to sit together and discuss any topic. This is one of my\
  \ greatest achievements: to encourage and to develop personalities to grow.\nWhat\
  \ have you heard about Azerbaijan or it\u2019s people? Before crossing the border\
  \ I had known nothing at all and I must admit, that was pretty scary. What I\u2019\
  ve learnt there is that every person stands out for his or her choices in life despite\
  \ the religion or other cultural factors. Locals call Azerbaijan the land of fire,\
  \ and the capital Baku \u2014 the city of the winds. Following my heart and passion\
  \ for dancing, I was lucky to become a performer of the 1st European Games in Baku.\
  \ Intensive rehearsals with professionals made me realise that it takes long hours\
  \ of hard work to shine for few minutes only, but every drop of sweat rewards you\
  \ with an unforgettable once in a lifetime experience.\nWandering around Caucasus\
  \ mountains, drinking pomegranate wine in the fields, watching astonishing sunsets\
  \ and sunrises surrounded with wild sheeps is something you must do when in Azerbaijan.\
  \ I\u2019ve seen the mountains in every different season and the best ones to go\
  \ are early fall and light snowy winter or blooming spring. Sleeping in the villages\
  \ and sharing traditional bread called Tandir straight from firewood oven makes\
  \ you feel blessed to be a traveler.\nFlying carpets in Azerbaijan gave me a strong\
  \ belief that everything is possible if you dare to choose what you truly wish for!"
