Text: "'I fucking hate the rainforest!' yelled Jana, her voice carrying over the valley\
  \ below. The three of us looked down as, rain falling lightly all around, the echoes\
  \ were swallowed up by the trees.\n\nThe Cameron Highlands are in the Pahang District\
  \ of Malaysia, an undulating landscape of thick rainforest and tea plantations.\
  \ Thanks to altitudes of up to 2000 metres, the average temperature is 18\xBAC,\
  \ substantially cooler than other parts of the country. A sweet relief for me, and\
  \ fellow travellers Eleri and Jana, after weeks of hot and humid weather. Ideal,\
  \ we thought, for hiking.\n\nMaps of the Highland trails are available to buy in\
  \ every hotel and shop in Tanah Rata, the area's largest town. At \xA31, the maps\
  \ are simple, roughly showing the location of each route, with no scale. We arrived\
  \ before the start of the monsoon season, but as our bus slowly wound its way in,\
  \ the road was already partially blocked by mudslides. Mindful of the changing weather,\
  \ we opted for a simple day trek, to mount a summit before heading back to town.\n\
  \nAfter catching a ride up to Brinchang, we met our first challenge before we'd\
  \ even begun. Sam Poh Temple, with its ornate decoration and striking grand red\
  \ gateway, was waiting for us on the hill. But a clear start to the trail was not.\
  \ As with most landmarks in the area, there were some souvenir stalls outside the\
  \ temple. In true tourist style, I asked for directions.\n\nThirty minutes later,\
  \ as I climbed a five-foot wall of mud, pulling myself up by two tree branches,\
  \ the distinct touch of a spider's web on my hand, I couldn't help wondering if\
  \ we'd been sent astray. The trail, if that's indeed what it was, was unmarked,\
  \ steep, frequently blocked by fallen trees, and looked very much as if the only\
  \ mammals that used it had four legs, not two.\n\nFor Jana, who was not a regular\
  \ hiker, it was clearly not what she'd had in mind. Especially once the rainforest\
  \ lived up to its name, and the heavens opened. We debated turning back, and might\
  \ have, but for seeing the way-marker. The trail met another, and became a clear\
  \ path. The trees thinned, and the slope began to level off. As we reached a plateau,\
  \ a valley of trees came into view below, no noise except the soft patter of the\
  \ rain, and the constant hum of life in the forest.\n\nThen Jana's shoe fell apart.\n\
  \nHer yell cut out suddenly across the calm valley, prompting Eleri and I to burst\
  \ out laughing. So did Jana. As we turned the next corner, the town came into view\
  \ below, the end in sight."
