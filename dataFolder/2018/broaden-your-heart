Text: "Four years ago, after getting burned out from the painstaking commitments and\
  \ responsibilities of my life at the time, I decided I needed to seek some sort\
  \ of retreat and adventure to change my perspective. Months before, I picked up\
  \ a Costa Rica Wildlife Guidebook in a free box on the side of the road, and I knew\
  \ I wanted to go. I had traveled all around the U.S. in my early twenties, but I\
  \ hadn't traveled outside of the country since I was younger. So, I did research\
  \ on transportation and the best hostels, I packed my bags, and I got on a flight.\
  \ I had incredible experiences when I was there. Traveling alone really lets you\
  \ be more aware of your surroundings and also forces you to connect with the people\
  \ around you. It was not always easy, and sometimes it was really quite stressful.\
  \ But, in the end, it was a very full and beautiful trip with many spontaneous twists\
  \ and turns.\n  Nine months later, I went to Central American again, only this time\
  \ with a friend. This time we were headed to Nicaragua, just north of Costa Rica.\
  \ They may be neighbors, but they couldn't be any more different. Costa Rica is\
  \ a wealthier nation that has never experienced war, covered in green rainforest,\
  \ and filled with the some of the most relaxed people in the world. Nicaragua has\
  \ experienced more war and conflict in the past 100 years than most countries of\
  \ the world, and they still struggle with poverty. I didn't really know what to\
  \ expect when we arrived, but I soon learned just how different they were.\n   Something\
  \ amazing happened to me in Nicaragua. I saw people who were so full of passion\
  \ and life, compassionate and genuine. Nothing against Costa Ricans, but the suffering\
  \ that Nicaragua has experienced has broadened the hearts of it's people. You could\
  \ see their hearts when you spoke to them - there was fire and love and deep roots\
  \ and wisdom. It was unlike anything I had experienced anywhere else. It's funny\
  \ because I didn't have culture-shock when I came to Nicaragua, but I did have it\
  \ when I came back home.\n   That trip made me realize how important it was to connect\
  \ with the people of each place I go. Knowing their history, their stories, their\
  \ hearts, and their daily lives will only broaden your travel experience and also\
  \ broaden your own heart. To only see a place for it's beautiful nature, architecture,\
  \ or food will only give you a small piece of the big picture. Each person you meet\
  \ can teach you something, and not just on a practical level. Be open to learn."
