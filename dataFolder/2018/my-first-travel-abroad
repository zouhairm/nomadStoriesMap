Text: "It was three years ago, i took a flight to Dublin with my best friend, my very\
  \ first time on a ariplane.. It was so exciting! \nWe arrived after two hours and\
  \ it felt strange to be in such a different place, i remember in particular that\
  \ the first thing that i said was: \"I see different colours and i breathe a new\
  \ air!\" Yeah, i know, it can be seen as something stupid but i was so happy in\
  \ that moment, i think that often happiness can be made of silly words. \nThen we\
  \ came into our residence where everything seemed to be perfect for us! there was\
  \ a common space where everybody in the residence could take place and got to know\
  \ each other and another space reserved for dinner and breakfast.\nthe next day\
  \ we began the course of English in a school near our residence and initially it\
  \ wasn't so easy because se weren't so strong in this language but after two days,\
  \ thanks to the support of the teacher and our new friends (some of them were italian\
  \ like us, but most of them were spanish) we managed to take away all of our fears!\
  \ \nWe had been there for two weeks so we had visited all the city of Dublin and\
  \ we had also done a trip to the northern ireland. Here the volcanic activity formed\
  \ the eerily geometric pillars of the Giant's Causeway on the north of Antrim coast.\
  \ The legend about this construction is so curious! \nWe visited Belfast too; we\
  \ only did one day tour but as you're walking along the murals and the walls that\
  \ separeted two religions i felt a little strange but all i can say is that it's\
  \ a beautiful city! \nIn peace, northern Ireland has staked its rightful claim as\
  \ one of the most beautiful and why not memorable ad cultural regions to be found\
  \ anywhere on the island of Ireland. I think that nowhere is Ireland's recent history\
  \ more strongly felt than in the North.\nAt night Dublin became an even more wonderful\
  \ city with a lot of people of our age, especially around the Trinity college which\
  \ is in the city centre and it's the most ancient college in Ireland where students\
  \ from all parts of the world came to study. Then, everyone must go to the Guinness\
  \ Storehouse, where you can learn more about how beer is made and you can also taste\
  \ the real Guinness (sincerely I didin't like it so much).\nFinally let's talk about\
  \ Temple bar, with all of our friends we went here everynight and we enjoyed it\
  \ so much, every day full of events and music!\nThis travel changes me a lot, it\
  \ was an experience that I would never forget, i met people that became my closest\
  \ friends and I feel so fortunate. Thanks Dublin!"
