Text: "Maybe it wasn't such a good idea, taking that busman's holiday. At 42 I'd signed\
  \ up as a trainee courier with Top Deck Travel, shepherding 18-35 year-olds round\
  \ Europe on a converted London double decker. It started to fall apart for me with\
  \ a catastrophic engine failure in Italy, stranding us on Corfu waiting for back-up.\
  \ Corfu in late Spring's not so bad,  but after a week there with no sign of rescue,\
  \ I'd seen enough.  \n\nI decided to abandon ship and hitch back to London with\
  \ minimal resources.. The last thing I expected was for the next five days to be\
  \ an object lesson in overcoming setbacks, along with the realisation that there\
  \ are so many unselfish folk willing to go out of their way to help you. \n\nTwo\
  \ young Canadians, Danielle and Denise, set the pace by offering me not just two\
  \ rides, to and from the town of Corfu, but also sharing with me \u2013 at their\
  \ expense - a memorable Greek feast, before I boarded the midnight ferry to Italy.\
  \ \n\nMy first 5 rainy hours in Italy were spent desperately seeking a lift from\
  \ Bari to the closest Autostrada. It was close to midday when a  plucky young Italian\
  \ teacher came to my rescue \u2013 she saw my Aussie flag and saw it as an opportunity\
  \ to practise her English. Two rides later, I spent that night sleeping on a marble\
  \ slab in a motorway toilet.\n\nI was woken in the middle of the night by schoolkids\
  \ who decided they would test my mettle by pelting me with toilet rolls. Summoning\
  \ my best Italian abuse, I chased them all out and resumed my uneasy slumbers. \n\
  \nAt 5am Alfredo's truck stopped at the servo. He generously offered to take me\
  \ several hundred kilometres along the spine of Italy, buying me lunch en route,\
  \ which with copious wine I'm afraid put me straight to sleep. Alfredo dropped me\
  \ north of Genoa, where a nightmare sequence began, which I won't go into here.\
  \ Enough to say I survived a few rides I wish I'd had the sense to refuse. \n\n\
  Much later I was with a French guy smoking \u2013 and carrying \u2013 a quantity\
  \ of pot. No worries, until the cops pulled us over, which entailed some fast talking\
  \ on my part. Two more friendly Frenchmen took me to Paris then to the coast at\
  \ Dieppe to catch the Channel ferry. Both bought me food, entertained me and the\
  \ second even invited me to stay over with  his family. \n\nI left Corfu on Sunday\
  \ night. Early next Friday I slept at a friend's house in west London, exhausted\
  \ and stony broke. An unplanned Odyssey, one I'd never repeat, though I dined out\
  \ on the story for quite a while."
