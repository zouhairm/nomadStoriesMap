Text: "Brazil has a lot of wonderful places, since great cities like Sao Paulo until\
  \ remote paradises like Fernando de Noronha. But between these two sides, there's\
  \ Foz do Igua\xE7u. Known by the Iguassu Falls, one of the Seven Natural Wonders\
  \ of the World, generally tourists go to Foz do Igua\xE7u and stay like three days,\
  \ just knowing the Falls and the Bird's Park, including sometimes Itaipu. But Foz\
  \ has so much more contents and if you give a chance to this beautiful city, you\
  \ can be surprised. \nI went to Foz do Igua\xE7u three times: one in 2015, and the\
  \ last two in 2017. It always looks like the first time, all the beauty, the weather,\
  \ the animals, the buildings, the history. Starting by the \"Marco das Tr\xEAs Fronteiras\"\
  , one of the best places in my opinion. A place that border three countries: Brazil,\
  \ Paraguay and Argentina, separated just by a river, the Paran\xE1. Now, the \"\
  Marco\" is revitalized and has a Jesuit's Mission scenographic's village, besides\
  \ a fountain with dancing water, a show about the indigenous that habitated the\
  \ area where is the city now and a magic light's show too. \nBeyond that, we had\
  \ the temples, highlighting the Muslim one and the Buddhist. Great buildings with\
  \ an exceptional decoration that results in fancy photos and big knowledge about\
  \ religions and cultures.\nGoing now to Itaipu, \"the world's largest generator\
  \ of renewable clean energy\" is how they define themselves. A binational places\
  \ between Brazil and Paraguai that is the biggest building I've ever seen in my\
  \ life until now, in every senses. There, we can visit since the Biological's Refuge,\
  \ which houses some exotic animals of the region that were affected by the construction\
  \ of the place, an EcoMuseum where we see a lot of Paran\xE1's History, and the\
  \ visits through the Itaipu (pay attention to the street while you're in the bus,\
  \ because there's a lot of \"capivaras\" in the way: beautiful and cute brazilian\
  \ animals.\nSome comercial places like the Dreamland Complex worth it too: it contains\
  \ the Wax Museum, the Dinosaurs' Valley and the Wonders of the World, with smaller\
  \ scales' representations of great buildings around the World.\nLast two, the most\
  \ known and, in my opinion, most importants: the Bird's Park and the Iguassu Falls\
  \ (Igua\xE7u's National Park). The first one is a refuge that helps brazilian exotic\
  \ birds that suffered with the ilegal traffic.\nFinally, the Iguassu Falls, the\
  \ \"must go\" of Foz, where you make a connection with the Earth's nature and yourself.\
  \ Just the best place ever."
