Text: "\u201C100 baht\u201D, quotes Phen.\n\nI smile,shrug and pursue, \u201CPlease\
  \ give 3 for 200 baht. If I convert this to Indian Rupees it amounts to 400\u201D\
  . \n\nI find the price too steep for the small packet of candied peels though I\
  \ hate to bargain.She dons a wry smile and gestures in a way that is neither assertive\
  \ nor negative. \n\nI am bemused. I wonder if this lady with a long white V-neck\
  \ tunic understood my explanation behind the haggling.\n\n\u2018Are you from India?',\
  \ she asks me.I nod affirmatively. \n\nShe proclaims, \u2018I love Bollywood movies\u2019\
  , with a wide grin that reaches her stoic eyes. I am stumped yet I manage a half-hearted\
  \ exclamation of \u2018Wow!\u2019\n\nIn this fleet of a moment, I wonder if it is\
  \ a routine marketing technique being employed by her to thrust the agricultural\
  \ products for the quoted price.But her eyes and smile are not in tandem with these\
  \ sceptical thoughts of mine.Rather, they look genuine.\n\n\u2018I love Shahrukh\u2019\
  , declares Phen and shocks me further!\n\nI am unable to fathom that a remote region\
  \ of Doi Inthanon with sparse population has access to technology leave alone watching\
  \ Bollywood movies.\nAnd above all, I am in a market of Karen Tribes who are refugees\
  \ from Myanmar, settled in the bordered mountainous regions of Chiang Mai. Many\
  \ of these tribal settlements lack basic amenities like electricity, proper roads\
  \ and sanitation.\n\nI conclude that this Karen lady must have picked few words\
  \ from Indian tourists like me.\n\nWith these thoughts in mind, I slowly rummage\
  \ through the mess in my handbag and pick out the mobile to open the photo gallery.\
  \ I confidently show Karen a photo of my family with Shahrukh. Her eyes brighten\
  \ up and she squeals in happiness.She enquires if I am related to him and is a little\
  \ disappointed when I respond negatively.\n\nKaren then declares that her brother\
  \ is a stunt-man in the Hindi Film industry, thus, squashing my ignorance and preconceived\
  \ notions about her. We exchange pleasantries and she confesses that I am her first\
  \ Indian friend.\n\nI offer the crisp notes of the Thailand Baht in exchange for\
  \ candied fruit peels at her quoted price, with no words exchanged.\n\nAnd just\
  \ before our car was to zoom away on the smooth as butter roads of the mountain,\
  \ Phen enquires,\u201DMeenu, when are you coming again\u201D?\n\nI am overwhelmed\
  \ with the guilt of having been judgmental and prejudiced towards a friendly person\
  \ like Pehn.I thank her silently for teaching valuable lessons of travel and promise\
  \ her with misty eyes,\u201DI shall come back soon to meet you, Pehn\u201D!"
