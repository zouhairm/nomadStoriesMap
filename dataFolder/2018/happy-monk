Text: "Tsultrim Tenzin-Lama\u2019s high-pitched, crinkle-eyed laugh burst from his\
  \ burgundy robes as he squeezed into the office to meet\u2014me. His tutor for a\
  \ week. A jet-lagged American thousands of miles from his uninspiring office at\
  \ his uninspiring job and further from his comfort zone. \n\nWhat do you do when\
  \ charged with teaching a Tibetan monk English a day after arriving in your first\
  \ truly foreign country? I started with tea. \n\nIn Dharamsala, you connect aromas.\
  \ Smoke curls from incense. Burning garbage erases your appetite. Street momos bring\
  \ it back in steaming heaps on paper plates. At the edge of town, cow pies. Their\
  \ perpetrators raid overflowing dumpsters. \n\nTsultrim weaved through town deliberately,\
  \ slightly hunched, carrying a black messenger bag. We sat on a bench with two cups\
  \ of chai. \u201CHow are you, Teacher?\u201D he asked. He was strikingly genuine.\
  \ He also couldn\u2019t pronounce \u2018r\u2019. \n\nThat first meeting revealed\
  \ a few things. One, Tsultrim loved learning more than all the Americans I\u2019\
  d tutored. \u201CI like Hillary Clinton,\u201D he said. \u201CShe intelligent!\u201D\
  \ Two, I had no idea what he could learn from me. Three: he hated Tibetan food and\
  \ loved pizza. \n\nFor the next few days, Tsultrim\u2019s consonant struggle guided\
  \ my lessons. I grabbed a copy of The Hunger Games from the office and told him\
  \ to read it aloud. \u201CTeacher,\u201D he said after I explained the book. \u201C\
  If I read this in America, I am very popular!\u201D\n\nOn a roof under ghostly Himalayan\
  \ peaks, Dharamsala bustling below us, we studied.  No, it\u2019s \u201Cvegetable\u201D\
  \ not \u201Cwegetable.\u201D Katniss lives in District 12 not Distick Twell. On\
  \ the fourth day he paused on the word \u201Cillegal.\u201D \n\n\u201CWhat illegal?\u201D\
  \ he said.\n\n\u201CAgainst the rules,\u201D I said. \u201CNot good.\u201D It was\
  \ the hardest I heard him laugh. \n\nThe next day, he told me how he came to India.\
  \ He fled Tibet into the mountains, traveling by night for 22 days to avoid Chinese\
  \ patrols. \u201CThey do what they have to, we do what we have to,\u201D he said.\n\
  \nFor our last session, I brought pizza\u2014yes there\u2019s a Pizza Hut in Dharamsala.\
  \ He exclaimed his thanks, but anything would have elicited the same response. He\
  \ had a gift for me too. A cloth scroll with a Dalai Lama message: If you contribute\
  \ to other people\u2019s happiness, you will find the true meaning of life. As Tsultrim\
  \ made me eat a slice of his pizza, I stared at the words. \n\nWhen we parted, he\
  \ hugged me. \u201CThank you Teacher! You\u2019re good. Not illegal!\u201D You\u2019\
  re the teacher, I thought. \n\nI knew I wouldn\u2019t see him again. But the scroll\
  \ comes wherever I go."
