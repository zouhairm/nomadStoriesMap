Text: "Before the last Sunday of November had someone asked me \u201CWhat\u2019s the\
  \ craziest thing you have done in life?\u201D I would have given it a long thought\
  \ and probably come up with an answer that wasn\u2019t crazy enough. That morning,\
  \ things changed.\nA week ago, 15 of us from across India had come together for\
  \ a trip to Bhutan which had turned out to be emotionally and experientially overwhelming.\n\
  On the last morning, as we were headed to the Airport to catch our flights back\
  \ home, we were all high on emotions, having bonded so well over the past week.\n\
  \u201CIf you could do something impulsively right now, what would it be?\u201D I\
  \ asked everyone in the car. It was our thing- to ask random questions and everyone\
  \ answers them.\nI knew what my answer was. I wanted everyone to know the emotional\
  \ turmoil I was in at that moment. I was in no mood to go back home leaving these\
  \ people behind.\n\u201CI would cancel my flight and stay back,\u201D came the unexpected\
  \ answer of Jyoti from the backseat, the last thing I expected anyone to say at\
  \ that moment.\nIt didn\u2019t take me another second to get the airline\u2019s\
  \ number and call them up \u201CHow much if I reschedule my ticket for 3 days later?\u201D\
  \nWhat had been \u2018a crazy thought\u2019 moments ago was being turned into reality.\n\
  \u2018Let\u2019s go to Darjeeling,\u2019 suggested Neeraj.\nWithin the next hour\
  \ amidst broken network coverage and calls to convince our parents and bosses, as\
  \ the car sped through paddy fields and forests, 3 of us had rescheduled our tickets\
  \ and 3 others had cancelled personal plans to be on this impulsive journey.\nThere\
  \ were two girls in the other car who wanted to come too.\n'Let's write 'COME' on\
  \ a paper and take our car parallel to their's. May be it will compel them to join\
  \ us,' Neeraj suggested, a situation straight out of a Bollywood movie. But that\u2019\
  s what we did next- Rolling down the window and holding up a paper with the message\
  \ as our car sped to go parallel with theirs.\nThe two girls were busy on their\
  \ phones probably trying to convince folks back at home for the extension of the\
  \ trip. The moment they saw us, the awe and surprise was evident on their cute faces.\n\
  The trip was impulsive. The destination didn\u2019t really matter. We just wanted\
  \ to be together somewhere, extending the trip to live the moment and to do what\
  \ our hearts told us to do.\nIt was difficult to believe that we had forged such\
  \ strong bonds with ones who were strangers a week ago. Probably this is what travel\
  \ does to us, creating everlasting friendships and unforgettable tales to tell."
