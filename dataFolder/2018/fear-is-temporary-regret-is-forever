Text: "For years I always allowed my fear to hold me back from taking risks and embarking\
  \ on various adventures. My freshman year of college, I along with many other students,\
  \ attended a workshop on studying abroad. I acknowledged that I finally needed to\
  \ stop allowing my fear to prevent me from living my life. I decided that if I was\
  \ going to go through with studying abroad I had to make a huge jump outside my\
  \ comfort zone and that's how I ended up in Australia. When I boarded my first flight\
  \ I couldn't help but worry that I was making a huge mistake and just kept thinking\
  \ to myself, \"what have I gotten myself into\". Once I landed in Australia I made\
  \ a promise to myself to stop saying no and start taking risks. The major turning\
  \ point for me was skydiving in Australia. Skydiving was never something I even\
  \ considered before, but I needed to live up to my promise and I finally said yes.\
  \ Putting on the gear and boarding that tiny plane my hands were physically shaking\
  \ with fear. Throughout the entire flight up I felt like my stomach was still on\
  \ the ground, but before I knew it I was sitting on the edge of the plane ready\
  \ to jump. The feeling of being entirely free just falling through the sky was a\
  \ life changing experience for me. At that very moment there was nothing wrong in\
  \ the world, all my worries has disappeared, and all I could think about was how\
  \ beautiful the miles and miles of blue ocean were beneath me. This is how I fell\
  \ in love with adventure. \nAustralia ignited this intense passion of traveling\
  \ for me that completely changed my view on the world. Two years ago I was entirely\
  \ content with my little version of the world I lived in, but now I have realized\
  \ there are so many amazing experiences all throughout the world just waiting to\
  \ be taken."
