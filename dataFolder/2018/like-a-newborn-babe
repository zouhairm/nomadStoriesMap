Text: "When I arrived in South Korea, my friend asked if I wanted to experience a\
  \ jjimjilbang. Public bath houses are an old tradition in Korea. About 15 years\
  \ ago, the jjimjilbang arrived on the scene. At a jjimjilbang you can hang out in\
  \ one of the many co-ed rooms (in provided shorts and t-shirt) have tea or snacks,\
  \ play games, or watch TV with your friends and family. There were a variety of\
  \ dry saunas \u2013 tall beehive-shaped rooms, and rooms with charcoal or clay walls.\
  \ My friend asked if I was ready for the Korean \u201Cscrub.\u201D Definitely yes.\
  \ \n In the women-only area, we left our key-bracelets on the table in the scrub\
  \ room. They would call our number when it was our turn. We soaked in a couple of\
  \ the numerous hot tubs, each differed in hotness by some undisclosed degrees. My\
  \ friend said we should soak until our skin felt \u201Citchy.\u201D Hmm. As an American,\
  \ I\u2019d never felt \u201Citchy\u201D after soaking in hot water. Relaxed yes,\
  \ itchy no.\n When our numbers were called, we went into the scrub room and carefully\
  \ laid on our backs on massage tables covered in thick plastic. The scrubber poured\
  \ a big tub of hot water down the length of my body.\_She applied a little oil to\
  \ the textured mit covering her hand, and began to scrub my feet. She moved to my\
  \ calves. She methodically scrubbed my thighs, stomach, chest, and neck, not missing\
  \ an inch. It was intense, very much like when you were a child and your mother\
  \ cleaned your dirty, unwilling face with a bit of water on a cloth, without any\
  \ care about how it might feel to you. She poured another tub of hot water over\
  \ me and scrubbed my arms. Then I looked down and saw it - my skin, rubbed off,\
  \ rolled into thin, tapering pieces two inches long. How had I been carrying around\
  \ so much extra skin? She signaled for me to turn over. She scrubbed my back like\
  \ was trying to rub off my tattoo. More and more skin came off. Another sluice of\
  \ hot water when my backside was done. No\_part of me was left unscrubbed, except\
  \ my face. Now it was time to do the whole thing again with a finer mit.\n Once\
  \ she was done, I sat there for moment, but not too long. Another customer had come\
  \ in and was asking about her turn. I stood up and walked out.\n My friend asked\
  \ what I thought.\n \u201CWow. It was a very physical experience.\u201D\n \u201C\
  How did you like being treated like an animal?\u201D She asked.  \n We laughed.\n\
  \ She said, \u201CIt wasn\u2019t bad.\u201D\n I said, \u201CIt was good, but right\
  \ on the edge of bad.\u201D\n She laughed. \n My skin felt like it never had in\
  \ my adult life, \u2018soft as a baby\u2019s bottom.\u2019"
