Text: "The town had just been splashed with rain. A few dilapidated cars and jumpy\
  \ motorbikes rumbled through the rocky streets but traffic was mostly comprised\
  \ of bare-footed children. Aracataca, Colombia is best-known \u2013 when it\u2019\
  s known at all \u2013 as the hometown of the legendary Gabriel Garc\xEDa M\xE1rquez.\
  \ Though the locals remain divided on their opinion of this gargantuan literary\
  \ figure, his presence is everywhere in the tiny enclave. His childhood home is\
  \ preserved as a museum; his face is plastered large on concrete walls.\n\nMy travel\
  \ companion and I, Veronica, were spending the week in Santa Marta, a once-busy\
  \ port now stained with age on the Caribbean coast of Colombia. A bumpy two-hour\
  \ bus ride from the city, Aracataca was high on my list of places to see. As we\
  \ rattled through streets more pothole than pavement, we drank in flickering scenes\
  \ of breezy tienda fronts where young boys with softball knees slouched against\
  \ door frames, and roaming chickens the color of cinnamon high-stepping through\
  \ dirt ditches. \n\nOnce out of the museum, our only objective were to explore and\
  \ to locate the bus station so as not to miss the last bus home. As we crossed over\
  \ the railroad tracks that marked the town's outer limits, we encountered sudden\
  \ commotion. \n\nIn the middle of a dusty path was an old woman, stooped and white-haired,\
  \ throwing small stones at a group of school girls. She yelled things unintelligibly\
  \ as she threw; the angrier she got, the harder the girls laughed. We had to find\
  \ out what was happening. \u201CShe was calling us the devil!\" the girls responded,\
  \ still giggling. Close up, they looked nothing like juvenile delinquents. Their\
  \ attention suddenly on us, they had approximately one million questions.  They\
  \ recited the Our Father for us in English proudly, having just learned it in school.\
  \ As they talked breathlessly over each other, the old woman slunk away. Getting\
  \ hungry, we asked the girls if they could recommend a place to eat. \n\nAs we made\
  \ our way through town, our girl band made quite the scene: two Americans, four\
  \ Colombians; four without shoes, two with shoes; two adults, four children. Laughing\
  \ at language impasses, posing for pictures. They led us right up to the door of\
  \ a bright pink restaurant front covered in pictures of the one thing on the menu:\
  \ grilled chicken. We said goodbye and watched them go. Transformed, if only briefly,\
  \ from tormenters to tour guides, they had brought us into their world and in doing\
  \ so, showed us a little bit of the magic that put Aracataca on the map."
