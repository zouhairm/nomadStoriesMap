Text: "I wake up. It\u2019s cold, and it appears to be about to start raining. A lightning\
  \ bolt flashes overhead. I spit some soil out of my mouth and brush some off from\
  \ the side of my face. I go to check the time on my phone, but the battery had gone\
  \ many hours before. I shake Luis\u2019s shoulder.\n\n\u201CQuick, it\u2019s about\
  \ to rain we need to go and take shelter in those toilets\u201D\n\nHe blinks several\
  \ times and puts on his glasses. There\u2019s another crash of thunder, and the\
  \ rain comes down quicker now. We stumble back through the wood tripping over roots\
  \ in the darkness still half asleep back to the track where we\u2019d seen the toilets\
  \ earlier that day.\n\nWhenever James Bond visited the French Riviera he spent his\
  \ time drinking cocktails, while lying on the golden sands of the beach with a Bond\
  \ girl. This is what I had had in mind when Luis had first suggested the trip to\
  \ Cannes two weeks earlier. Why then was I now lying on the floor of a disabled\
  \ toilet on a former French prison island, sheltering from a storm, with Luis a\
  \ chain-smoking Mexican philosophy student?\n\nThe Isle of Sainte-Marguerite lies\
  \ off the coast of Cannes. As Luis and I had wandered around the island on a windy\
  \ November day, looking around the fort and prison where the man in the iron mask\
  \ had been kept prisoner in the 17th century, we\u2019d come to the conclusion that\
  \ it\u2019d be a pretty grim place to be imprisoned, and that it would make a good\
  \ setting for a horror film.\n\nI\u2019d met Luis during the first week of my Erasmus\
  \ year abroad in Lyon. We\u2019d got to know each other quite well, but in the 24\
  \ hours stuck together on the island, there was time for all those \u201Cit\u2019\
  s a long story\u201D stories. \n\nWe decide to venture further around the coast\
  \ of the island to see the nature reserve it was as we were sitting watching the\
  \ birds swoop and dive into the sea, that we noticed our boat pulling into the harbour\
  \ in the distance. \n\n\u201CThe boat\u2019s arriving early considering it doesn\u2019\
  t leave for another half hour,\u201D Luis remarked. \n\n\u201CPerhaps we had better\
  \ set off back.\u201D I had replied. \n\nWe set off. The sun was just beginning\
  \ to set and as we walked we discussed what we were going to eat on a return to\
  \ the mainland. It was then that we saw the boat leaving. We started to run but\
  \ by the time we reach the harbour, it is long gone. We stand there in a stunned\
  \ silence as we both catch our breath and it slowly dawns on us that we\u2019re\
  \ stuck on the Island.\n\n\u201CShit,\u201D I say.\n\n\u201CShit indeed\u201D replies\
  \ Luis."
