Text: "I began my travels in Frankfurt, and set out on foot to explore the city. To\
  \ my luck there was a multi-day festival taking place along the riverbank. The bands\
  \ playing along the water\u2019s edge alternated between singing sets of songs in\
  \ German and songs in English. The event proved very popular, and crowds of people\
  \ flocked to the festival to listen to the music, try delicious meats and pastries,\
  \ and browse the various vendor booths. Another of the highlights of traveling to\
  \ Germany was taking a boat tour where I got to see more castles on one stretch\
  \ of river than I even realized existed in Germany! The castles were usually perched\
  \ on a hill and surrounded by a parish or village below, and there was almost always\
  \ a church nearby. It truly gave me the sense I was in \u201CThe Old World\u201D\
  \ and just being there, and taking in those sights for the first time, felt almost\
  \ magical and even surreal. Later in my travels I was able to tour some of the castles\
  \ in person. My favorite overall was Heidelberg Castle, which boasted grandiose\
  \ ruins and a spectacular view of the valley below. I had the good fortune to be\
  \ there when the sun set and was able to capture some of my favorite pictures from\
  \ my whole trip as the light hit the river below and the colors of the day began\
  \ to transform with the sunset. While there were so many discoveries I could write\
  \ about, I will conclude by sharing one of my favorite experiences, which was visiting\
  \ the German wine country. I got lost while trying to configure my navigation system\
  \ and noticed what appeared to be the ruins of a castle on a hill with a small eatery.\
  \ After asking several locals for directions and one long hike later I reached my\
  \ destination and found myself at the ruins on top of a hill somewhere near the\
  \ Palatinate Forest along the German wine road. The menu was full of various German\
  \ wines, and like the beer, the wine was very decently priced too. There were grape\
  \ vines with bushels of grapes hanging overhead on the patio coverings and plenty\
  \ of places to sit and gaze out at the sprawling green vineyards of the wine country\
  \ below. As I sat there sipping my wine and looking out at the beautiful vista,\
  \ I felt happy, and surprised at what a remarkable place I had found, and overall\
  \ what an amazing time I had been having exploring Germany. It was the last thing\
  \ I expected to find, and it felt good."
