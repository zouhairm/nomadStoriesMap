Text: "Being an Indian traveling in India is for finding that Unity nd connection\
  \ in the Diversity of Land Langauge Food nd People of country.. \n\nThis is about\
  \ my travel to Shimla and Kullu Manali ..which is in Northern part of India in Himachal\
  \ Pradesh. \n\nShimla is place mentioned in our history books and going there was\
  \ a dream.. it was the first step towards getting near to Himalayas.. where you\
  \ can see snow peaked mountain ranges of Himalayas nd feel the chill .. \n\nKufri\
  \ point was the most loved point in Shimla where we experienced snow for the first\
  \ time in our lives.. it made us more excited abt next stop at Kullu nd Manali...\n\
  \nManali was heaven on Earth for us at that point in time.. Solang Valley was White\
  \ Paradise.. skiing.. winter sports.. hot noodles in snow.. what more can we ask\
  \ for.. life is made up of such Blissful moments.. v three nd nature at it's best...\
  \ \n\nKullu was next stop nd we ventured into adventure by doing White River Rafting\
  \ and it was hell of an experience..For a moment I felt I'll die.. but luckily I\
  \ didn't.. the team there ensured I was alive and back safe on ground.. Trust me\
  \ I felt so Grateful to be Alive that day.. I seriously did... \n\nWay back from\
  \ Kullu Manali to Chandigarh was long drive through neumerous mountains nd valleys\
  \ nd nature nd blooming purple nd violet flowers.. I felt I was in different world\
  \ than I was living earlier... Away from hustle nd bustle of day to day office kids\
  \ school lunch dinner.. away from all.. \n\nLife is full of such experiences which\
  \ give us opportunities to connect with yourself nd with nature.. those are moments\
  \ when u find yourself .. u find what you love.. you find what keeps you going..\
  \ you connect to lot of strangers.. nd you get in touch with their kindness..which\
  \ really touches your heart.. \n\nLooking forward to making more memories than bringing\
  \ memorabilia.. Life happens when ur lost like a wanderer.. when u are one with\
  \ nature.. when touch fresh snow.. when u dip ur leg in sea water.. when u smell\
  \ sweet fragrance of flowers.. when u get lost in colourful medows..."
