Text: "She stood about five feet tall, but she was as strong as the stone cathedrals.\
  \ Both had survived earthquakes and the hardships of the years. Both were old. Yet\
  \ she was lean in a teal blouse, fitted to her figure. And as she turned each page\
  \ of a binder, showing me the fine furniture her many sons had made, I was overcome\
  \ with admiration and respect, awe and appreciation for this woman who had accomplished\
  \ so much in her lifetime with her husband. Life could not have been easy for her,\
  \ yet here she stood with poise, her long white braid making her appear much younger.\
  \ I had come to this country to meet locals such as this. I was in Antigua, one\
  \ of the best preserved colonial cities in the world and the heart of Guatemala.\
  \ The purpose of my journey was two-fold: to explore the culture, and to practice\
  \ my Spanish. My language school was on the same street, and I noticed the elderly\
  \ couple sitting outside their store, watching the buses come and go, and just being\
  \ part of the scene. Everyday they sat and participated in the cobblestoned street.\
  \ To either side were more stucco buildings in hyacinth blue, yellow ochre, and\
  \ red russet; tiled roofs shielding the equatorial sun. A ring of  puffing volcanoes\
  \ served as backdrop. After seeing me once, the couple seemed to recognize me and\
  \ wave. One afternoon I stopped to have a look. The husband stayed out front and\
  \ kept up his watch while the doyenne showed me around. \u201CMira\u201D she said,\
  \ pointing to the carved scrolling decorations . \u201CAh, muy bonita\u201D I sighed.\
  \ Of course, she wanted to make a sale, I knew that. But she also pointed to a newspaper\
  \ article written about their longstanding presence in the community. Her eleven\
  \ sons have carried on the family trade, she said, and they will make custom furniture\
  \ to order. This is how I found myself looking over a binder with her as she proudly\
  \ pointed to pictures of baroque-style bed frames, cabinets, and dressers. In a\
  \ secretly triumphant moment, I was carrying on a conversation with this very native\
  \ of Guatemalans. Bridging the gap between our worlds reinforced the reasons why\
  \ I study this language, and why I came to this little kaleidoscope city under the\
  \ puffy clouds. \n\nI bought two gilded mirrors, about 8 inches wide, easy to pack\
  \ for the journey home. She wrapped them in paper and smiled when I gave her the\
  \ money, touching my arm. This was her livelihood. But I had benefitted just as\
  \ much from the exchange. The world became a little smaller for me on that day."
