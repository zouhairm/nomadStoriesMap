Text: "Sometimes I think I am not Kazakh. I have very few friends from Kazakhstan.\
  \ Maybe it is because I love traveling, I have been in Turkey, China, United States\
  \ and also I have been in a lot of cities in my country. How did I understand that\
  \ I love traveling? When I was 14 years old, I went to hip hop dance classes, so\
  \ it means that I should to know American culture. I started dance and danced well.\
  \ Went to my first competition in Aktau and I won that. I was so happy and started\
  \ training more and more. I went to Atyrau and Astana, took the first and second\
  \ places. Went to the dance camp in Almaty. That day I saw first foreigners in my\
  \ life, I was so excited to talk with them because that time I started learning\
  \ English. There were four foreigners: from France, United Kingdom,Korea, Germany.\
  \ They were so different, different appearance, different color of skin, language,\
  \ but all of them had same life style, they really loved dancing. \nLater, I graduated\
  \ school and went to university. I could understand English language, maybe not\
  \ so perfect, but I understand when people talk to me. My major was Oriental Studies\
  \ (Chinese language). When I was in the third form, I went to China like exchange\
  \ student. I went to Hainan island, nobody before from our university didn\u2019\
  t go there to study, it was tropical paradise. I met a lot of friends from Cabo\
  \ Verde, there were 97 students. They were very friendly and always smiled. They\
  \ taught me how to enjoy life without worry about everything. Everything was easy\
  \ for them. They could party till 6-7 in the morning and after go to classes, and\
  \ do that day after day. But I thought that it\u2019s impossible. When I saw how\
  \ did they dance I was in the shock. I never thought that people can move slowly\
  \ and sexy like them. I tried to learn and I can, but not like them because it is\
  \ in their blood. Few days ago I came back from that tropical paradise, I saw that\
  \ awesome guys, was very happy. They did not change, but they told that I changed\
  \ a lot. I was glad to see them after 2 years, and was so happy to see them in the\
  \ same place. And it was so sad because I were there only 7 days, and it wasn\u2019\
  t enough for me. Because I know that our friendship will be forever, and that guys\
  \ will be in my heart for a long time. One guy invited me to his wedding in Capo\
  \ Verde, and I really hope to meet them again over there. \nThis story only about\
  \ Capo Verden friends, maybe next time I will tell you about my US trip=)"
