Text: "It was April 27th 2017 and as I pack my life into suitcase I prepare my self\
  \ for what I'm leaving behind, a career that I love, my family, friends and everything\
  \ I've ever known. Tomorrow I will board a plane and travel to the other side of\
  \ the world and for what? To horseback guide in the Canadian Rockies, yeah your\
  \ thinking this girl has got to be kidding right?\n\nWrong, here I am ditching the\
  \ idea of the good life, you know what I'm talking about the perfect degree, then\
  \ the dream job, perfect husband, the perfect house finished off with a white picket\
  \ fence, 2.5 kids, that six figure salary and a paddock full of horses, that last\
  \ one might just be me. I'm happily waving goodbye to that 'ideal' life, scrapping\
  \ my 20's and heading off to explore the big bad world. \n\nOkay enough of the sunshine\
  \ and rainbows lets get to the real talk moving abroad is freaking hard. Yeah you\
  \ hear me, it\u2019s challenging, and you don\u2019t always get what you want, that\
  \ awesome job may not be exactly what you thought it was when you get there, the\
  \ airline could lose your luggage its not always smooth sailing pals. Movies like\
  \ Eat, Pray, Love have glorified traveling and living overseas, making it look like\
  \ a bloody walk in the park, when in reality, it can be like walking on thorns.\
  \ The movies rarely show the hard times, tears, panic attacks, trust me they happen\
  \ and they make it look so effortless when most of the time it's far from easy.\
  \ Moving abroad pushed me to the edge, but it's a decision I wouldn't change for\
  \ anything.\n\nLiving and travelling on solo has made me into a better person and\
  \ given me an education that you cant find inside a classroom. I've got friends\
  \ that I can call family from all across the globe. I've learnt how to manage my\
  \ money the hard way, seriously I ate cornflakes for like a week, I have been able\
  \ to educate people about horses, wildlife and the beautiful Rocky Mountains, I\
  \ certainly have not regretted being pushed to become more each and every day. \n\
  \nSo this is my story, I add to it every day. What are you going to make yours?"
