Text: "A big crowd started counting, the last seconds of 2017. And while 2018 made\
  \ his entrance his lips found mine, and it was not just a spark, it was a whole\
  \ firework show. It probably has something to do with the alcohol of that night,\
  \ probably also the fact that we\u2019re in one of the most beautiful countries\
  \ in the world, but it has the most to do with the fact that I\u2019m kissing a\
  \ guy I\u2019m madly in love with. \n\nMy phone starts buzzing and it is my mom,\
  \ calling at 12pm in The Netherlands. I see her lips moving, but of course I have\
  \ no idea what she is saying. The firework show is still happening in the background,\
  \ so I change to the back camera to show her how we celebrate New Year\u2019s Eve\
  \ in New Zealand. My phone keeps on buzzing to tell me all my friends back home\
  \ are thinking about me. And I didn\u2019t even notice until I feel a hand on my\
  \ cheek to wipe away my tears. \n\n\u201CAre you okay?\u201D\n\nAnd I was. More\
  \ than okay even. It took me so long to see that I\u2019m the happiest girl on earth\
  \ since years. You know the grass really gets greener, the mountains really get\
  \ higher and the oceans really get bluer when you\u2019re in love? It has to be\
  \ true or a miracle just happened. \n\n5 months ago, I was crying at the airport,\
  \ because I had to miss my friends, family and (now ex-) boyfriend for half a year.\
  \ Right now, I\u2019m kissing my soulmate and cry because I\u2019m so happy. Some\
  \ people find love just around the corner, others have to travel all the way to\
  \ the other side of the world to get it. Every time I travel I fall in love with\
  \ something, with a good restaurant, a beautiful park, a lovely waterfall or just\
  \ their amazing culture, but this time it was different. I fell in love with the\
  \ lovely people, the mountains everywhere, the ice cold but beautiful oceans, the\
  \ sheep everywhere and finally with this sweet, funny, handsome and incredibly smart\
  \ guy. Falling in love in New Zealand was the last thing I had in mind and I guess\
  \ it\u2019s true what they are saying about love. You\u2019ll only find love when\
  \ you\u2019re not looking for it.\n\nWe decide to call it a night, since we cannot\
  \ find our friends anymore and we have to get up early tomorrow to continue our\
  \ road trip. It\u2019s not even an hour into 2018 and almost everybody has already\
  \ failed their New Years resolutions. I would die for a box of chicken nuggets at\
  \ the moment, but one of my resolutions is to wait less this year. We\u2019ve only\
  \ got a month left in New Zealand and I don\u2019t want to spend any minute of that\
  \ waiting for something."
