Text: "Lost in thoughts, I spasmed in response to the innocuous sound of a bike bell.\
  \ I steadied my bike and gave enough room for a pass. He smiled and said, \u201C\
  Merci!\u201D as he sped past me. In a matter of minutes, he blended into the horizon\
  \ pedalling past a tree-lined bike trail sprinkled with autumn leaves en route to\
  \ Montauban. The solitude continued until I hit the destination on my GPS.\n\nI\
  \ was in a lane of cookie-cutter houses. What if a tipsy bloke knocked on a neighbour\u2019\
  s door instead of his I envisaged and chuckled. Just then my phone buzzed. It was\
  \ Claire, my couch surfing host, enquiring my whereabouts. I replied, \u201CI\u2019\
  m outside but not sure which one\u201D.\n\nThe French lass greeted me with a \u201C\
  Faire la bise\u201D, pressing her cheeks against mine, not once but twice. It was\
  \ a first for me, a contrast to the non-contact \u201CVanakkam(Namaste)\u201D, the\
  \ norm in my orthodox Indian Tamil household. I entered her minimalist home and\
  \ yet again the kitchen, dining, sofa and TV coalesced into a single living room\
  \ just like Zora\u2019s, my previous host, who hosted me in Carcassonne the night\
  \ before.\n\nUnlike Claire\u2019s empty walls Zora\u2019s was adorned with abstract\
  \ art canvases, courtesy her prized possession, an easel. Saturated with the aroma\
  \ of burning incense, her home had an antique vibe akin to the \u201CCit\xE9 de\
  \ Carcassonne\u201D. I curiously queried Zora the reason for the ensemble. She replied,\
  \ \u201CCooking is central to the way we socialize\u201D. Mom\u2019s closed kitchen\
  \ flashed before my eyes. New acquaintances rarely make it that far. Dad\u2019s\
  \ uncharted territory, mom\u2019s kingdom. Mom takes pride in her culinary skills\
  \ as she often remarks, \u201CThe way to a man\u2019s heart is through his stomach.\u201D\
  \ Zora\u2019s index finger grabbed my attention as she pointed at some fish fillets\
  \ and asked, \u201CAny supper ideas?\u201D\n\nAs we bonded over an Indo-French fish\
  \ curry and baguettes, I casually asked her whether she has any kids. Preening the\
  \ silver hairs around her temples, she shook her head as she felt kids are too big\
  \ a responsibility and the idea of marriage doesn\u2019t interest her either. She\
  \ further added she was going steady with her current boyfriend. It puzzled me.\
  \ A woman in her fifties having a boyfriend is unheard of in the Indian social labyrinth.\
  \ She counter questioned, \u201CIs it true that Indian parents search a partner\
  \ for their kids?\u201D I nodded. She raised her brows and continued, \u201CWould\
  \ your parents approve a European girl?\u201D I blushed.\n\n\u201CAll\u2019s well?\u201D\
  , asked Claire, handing me a pint. \u201CYes! Just lost in thoughts\u201D, I replied."
