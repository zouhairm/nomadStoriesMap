Text: "If you belong to an ethnic minority and your skin is brown when you go travelling\
  \ you can pass for being from almost anywhere. Every time I go to France every Moroccan\
  \ and their mama start hollering at me in Arabic. I even had one lady who was adamant\
  \ I was Tunisian, so much so that she claimed I was definitely Muslim. In America\
  \ I always get spoken to in Spanish as most think I am Mexican or native. I remember\
  \ a guy in Canada who claimed I was native because I looked like his ex-girlfriend.\
  \ Terrible pick up line! But we\u2019ll just leave that story for another day. Last\
  \ year I went to Thailand for a little bit of a treat yourself get away and I had\
  \ never experienced anything quite like it.  I wasn\u2019t a huge fan of Bangkok\
  \ because it was crowded, loud and in your face, but I was in awe of the islands.\
  \ Back home people always can tell that I am mixed, but I never thought I\u2019\
  d pass as Asian. When I arrived I didn\u2019t realise how much I looked like them\
  \ and it even made me question if I was part Thai. Everywhere I went I was let into\
  \ attractions for free, got cheaper taxis and was spoken to in Thai even though\
  \ I clearly couldn\u2019t understand. When I travel my favourite thing to do is\
  \ mix with the locals, to see the raw beauty of the country that not many experience.\
  \ I ended up hanging with a group of Thai girls at a bar who thought I was Thai\
  \ and was approached by some random old men who were trying to pick us up. I burst\
  \ out laughing and pulled out my accent which completely confused them. Time had\
  \ gone by and I ended up getting bitten by a monkey which led to a good 6 injections.\
  \ On the first round of shots I immediately went partying with a plaster wrapped\
  \ around my hand and the second I ended up burning my leg on a motorbike, but the\
  \ final round of shots was the most memorable. I turned up to the hospital to be\
  \ greeted in Thai and was told that only one doctor spoke English. The receptionist\
  \ kept yelling at me to speak Thai and when I reached the doctor he told me that\
  \ my parents should\u2019ve taught me Thai. I just laughed and agreed with him;\
  \ I was too tired to care. I ended up in universities dancing with students, joking\
  \ with monks who love Hip Hop music, and ended up in a neighbourhood that I thought\
  \ was a market until a lady told a tourist that only residents were allowed to enter.\
  \ I felt like I had returned to my motherland but that I had forgotten how to speak\
  \ to her. I think I should\u2019ve mentioned earlier that my DNA test came back\
  \ with part Asian."
