Text: "Prove to imagine how people can feel when they are treated like animals,try\
  \ to think how people can feel when they are oppressed by their strict social rules\
  \ or when they can't express their real thoughts;during my stay in Turkey I could\
  \ understand what they wanted from me and what I could learn from them.\n\nI was\
  \ working in a refugee camp where I could be present to develop each kind of aspect\
  \ for helping human rights.But sometimes the refugees could become lost in inhabiting\
  \ a constant state of uncertainty and for this reason I provided to help children\
  \ to find their balance,to find a local connection.\nBefore helping others I had\
  \ to immerse myself in their culture,so I decided to have an ethnic party.The best\
  \ party I\u2019ve ever organized! Colors and music shaked the camp!People smiled,people\
  \ laughed!\nDuring this thrilled night I met a girl from Azerbaijan,and her eyes,oh\
  \ my God!They were so shining from the first time they saw me.\nThe following days\
  \ I decided to spend my free time with the girl,I told her many stories from Italy,how\
  \ we make pizza,cakes,pasta and how we are jealous of our art and architecture in\
  \ the world,I reported my experiences and she decided to talk with me about her\
  \ little life:imagine an arid place,a lot of warm,\u2019\u2019foods\u2019\u2019\
  ,a dark-skinned girl and a doll,she loved to play with her toy,maybe because it\
  \ was her only friend in a lonely land,she had a dream,she wanted to learn english\
  \ and become a doctor,she was a smart girl who didn\u2019t have the opportunity\
  \ to study and thanks to some volunteers she started to learn a new language,mathematics\
  \ and chemistry.I supported her dream from the first time we met talking about some\
  \ association of doctors in Italy that help people in need in other countries bringing\
  \ medicines, vaccines and she was amazed.\nAfter work I could leave my camp and\
  \ go where my heart wanted,I saw the dervishes who in an hypnotic dance mesmerises\
  \ your mind,then the hoodoo also called fairy chimney and every day I reported my\
  \ experiences to the \u2018\u2019green eyes girl\u2019\u2019 of the camp,she could\
  \ dream through my eyes and the last day I decided to leave her one of my diaries\
  \ with some pictures taken in different countries,it was so touching.\nDuring this\
  \ experience I wrote many diary pages,sometimes I\u2019m too detailed and I have\
  \ to resume many events in few words,it is heartrending.\nWith this page I decided\
  \ to catch the best moral facts that touched my soul more than I could believe and\
  \ I\u2019m sure that these words sensitize your heart."
