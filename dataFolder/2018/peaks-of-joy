Text: "Blame it on age or hormones. People in their teens and forties behave the same\
  \ --- is what my experience has been. \uF04A:)   You want to explore yourself both\
  \ internally and externally, do different things, challenge the limits, challenge\
  \ yourself, and question the obvious\u2026 \nSo my story is about a 40 plus woman\
  \ - I  Inked myself, ran marathons, started taking cycling more seriously, trekked\
  \ more frequently in the Sahyadris (Western Ghats), wore more sarees to work, and\
  \ went on more road trips with the family. But one thing that remained pending on\
  \ the big buck list of \u2018life to-do\u2019s\u2019 is to climb the mighty mountains\u2026\
  \ THE HIMALAYAS.  \nWith a zeal to challenge and push myself out of my comfort zone,\
  \ do the unconventional\u2026 I signed up for Sandakphu in Northern Himalayas with\
  \ one of the Trek organizers. Sandakphu is the highest point in Eastern Himalayas,\
  \ and is located between two countries, India and Nepal. \nMy first Himalayan trek\
  \ experience would always remain as fresh as my mother\u2019s freshly brewed coffee\u2026\
  \ This amazing trek takes us through two countries, and is absolutely amazing \u2013\
  \ since you can be walking in India for a few hours, and stopping for dinner in\
  \ Nepal and again pitching tents in Indian Territory. \nThe mountains however, ask\
  \ for great discipline, greater resolve and greatest of will. I responded to this\
  \ by taking 1 step after another \u2026 till it reached a point where it became\
  \ tough to take 20 steps one after the other. But with baby steps and deeper breaths,\
  \ I reached the peak. The joy at being able to do that was immense, the views priceless\
  \ - pictures of which have been forever etched in my mind, and an experience which\
  \ has been stored and cherished among the various layers of my head."
