Text: "For most, the thought of Spain conjures up images of arid expanses, white washed\
  \ walls and of course, the golden Mediterranean beaches basking in perpetual sun.\
  \  However unbeknown to the masses, me included, this land is way more varied and\
  \ diverse than one could have ever imagined.  A Spaniard once told me they refer\
  \ to their home as a \u2018continent in miniature\u2019 and the shock of Green Spain\
  \ helped me realise just why. \nAnyone familiar with flying over the Iberian Peninsula\
  \ in mid-August will be accustomed to seeing the sea of red and orange pastures\
  \ below them. To my utter disbelief, underneath me a lush green world was slow to\
  \ reveal itself from a thick veil of cloud. Are we still in Spain?  As we began\
  \ to make our gentle decent into the heavy covering of cotton wool clouds; below\
  \ a lush green oasis began to unravel its secrets.  Heavily vegetated hillsides\
  \ and rugged mountain forests greeted my startled eyes. The Eden of Spain was quickly\
  \ unfolding. It wasn\u2019t just the number of trees and lush fields that captivated\
  \ me but the wild, unspoilt coastline to my left. Cliffs, rocks, and inlets; the\
  \ cloud forest dived into the sea like a serrated knife, and with dramatic effect.\
  \ There the land met the fury of a foreboding north Atlantic and its tempestuous\
  \ waves. \nAs I stepped off the plane I was hit by the wall of heavy, fresh, moisture\
  \ laden air; a far cry from the oven I\u2019d left behind in Barcelona. For a wary\
  \ English traveller, this strange Green Spain had a comforting air of home. \nThe\
  \ Basque capital bursts into view before me, Bilbao straight ahead, the sign indicated.\
  \ Posturing majestically in front of me was the famous La Salve Bridge, whose bright\
  \ red rounded form looked more like an art work of its equally impressive neighbour,\
  \ the Guggenheim. This world renowned landmark\u2019s impressive contorted metal\
  \ exterior gleamed like a jewel on the Nervi\xF3n River which gently ebbed through\
  \ the centre of the city. What a welcome, I thought. Beyond the bridge, and entering\
  \ the perimeter of the city I had to keep pinching myself that I wasn\u2019t in\
  \ northern Europe and that this indeed was still Spain. A fact not helped by the\
  \ sign postings written in Basque, the oldest language in Europe. My transfer ended\
  \ at the old city where Spain appeared to meets North Yorkshire. A far cry from\
  \ the white streets of Andalusia, the buildings of Bilbao are cast in a honey coloured\
  \ sand stone, like nothing I\u2019d seen in Spain before."
