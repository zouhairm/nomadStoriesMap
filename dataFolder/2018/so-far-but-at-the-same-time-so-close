Text: "I used to consider travel as holidays with all comforts they brings. Then I\
  \ learned that travel means discovery, experience, bravery and above all curiosity.\
  \ That was not perfectly clear to me before the most memorable trip I did so far\
  \ in Myanmar. When I arrived in Singapore as exchange student I did not even know\
  \ about the existence of Myanmar (The old Burma). Eventually I decided to fly to\
  \ Yangon with a 7 kilos backpack for one week around the country. Yangon is a big\
  \ city where the hand of the western man is more than visible but not strong enough\
  \ to change those people\u2019s mentality.  What impressed me the most is that,\
  \ differently from other countries, Burmese people did not look at me as a walking\
  \ dollar and I truly felt their kindness and honesty. They smiled just because they\
  \ were happy and glad to be the subjects of my pictures. I moved from Bagan to Kalaw\
  \ where I found Sam\u2019s family who organizes guided treks to Inle Lake. During\
  \ the trek I slept one night in the farm of an old family in one of the villages\
  \ I visited with my guide GoGo, a smart 23 years old Burmese girl and the rest of\
  \ the group. This has probably been the most meaningful part of my trip: I met great\
  \ local people, so closed in their slice of the world but open-minded enough to\
  \ host strangers in their house, have dinner with them without getting one single\
  \ word of their language. Someone might say \u201Cof course, they got paid for that\u2026\
  \u201D This is true but I saw in their eyes the curiosity to meet people from places\
  \ so far in the world and the willingness to share their culture. I can surely say\
  \ that it was a gift. The intimacy of that house is something I will never forget!\
  \ Once we reached the lake we arrived to the other bank by a little wooden boat\
  \ and I admired how the fishermen work and how parents wait for their kids in the\
  \ boats down the schools built on stilts just as our parents wait in their cars.\
  \ Something was magical in that place and made me calm. Once somebody told me he\
  \ was tired to travel around because all the places started to look the same for\
  \ him after a while and he could not get excited anymore. I was shocked since I\
  \ strongly believe that every travel has its own meaning. The experience is made\
  \ of people we meet, the attitude we show, the little moments we live. This means\
  \ life. It is impossible to get bored of living our life and this is why all of\
  \ us should take care of what is around us. It is not a duty\u2026 it is the greatest\
  \ pleasure that a human being can enjoy."
