Text: "Day 24. Santa Fe was so cold today I felt the frigid air in my bones and teeth.\
  \ Grey skies, yellow buildings, a sad river that hadn\u2019t quite frozen\u2014\
  this is what I saw on my way to dinner. Dinner with whom? No one. Myself. Me and\
  \ my phone. We picked a Spanish place for happy hour\u2014La Boca for half-priced\
  \ tapas. I sit at the bar and avoid eye contact with the other patrons. My phone\
  \ occupies me as I wait for the food, secretly willing someone to talk to me. I\
  \ hate eating alone.\n\nI\u2019ve been traveling alone on a cross-country road trip.\
  \ I chose Santa Fe because of the songs\u2014Captain Jack sings of a warm place,\
  \ as a city made of clay, not the stone-cold capitol I found. I walked home after\
  \ I finished eating, the weight of truffle oil-drenched bruschetta depressing my\
  \ stomach. Eating alone is a new experience; before, I consumed sandwiches and Clif\
  \ Bars on day-long hikes through national parks. Before, I always had people to\
  \ eat with or a place to hide my shame. I avoided my fear.\n\nDay 25. Another night\
  \ in Santa Fe, a sorrowful lunch experience averted by a hike in Kasha-Katuwe, my\
  \ phone and I picked another restaurant. I\u2019m in a new part of the city, but\
  \ my phone is dying and I think of turning back, ordering Chinese food, and reading\
  \ a book. But no, here I am. Another restaurant, another seat at the bar. The women\
  \ to my right are absorbed in conversation; the couple on my left don't notice me.\
  \ My phone is dead; I order food and a beer. I see two strangers meet on the other\
  \ side of the bar. They become friends. As I wonder how I can be like them, one\
  \ makes eye contact; I quickly avert my gaze, down my beer, and order another. No\
  \ use. Even beer can\u2019t fix the dryness in my mouth.\n\nDay 26. Dinner, my last\
  \ night here. Google recommends The Shed. I order the spiciest menu item\u2014maybe\
  \ someone will see my pain and offer help. And I, paralyzed by the capsaicin on\
  \ my tongue, will be forced to accept. Eating alone won\u2019t seem so bad after\
  \ that. A woman sits next to me and orders the spicy food I\u2019m having: a blue\
  \ corn enchilada with red chile. The spiciness must have lowered my inhibitions\
  \ because I immediately tell her how delicious it is. We talk some more; she orders\
  \ me something to help with the pain in my mouth. \n\nI didn\u2019t expect to make\
  \ new friends. I didn't expect to sit at the bar until closing or to hug a stranger\
  \ from three hours ago goodbye. \n\nDay 27. Oklahoma City. I'm not afraid of eating\
  \ alone. I put my phone away, sit next to three guys, and make new friends."
