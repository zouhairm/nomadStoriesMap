Text: "Neighbouring nuclear-armed countries India and Pakistan had just decided to\
  \ have talks that could lead to future peace talks.  Two days after the announcement,\
  \ February 13th, 2010 the German Bakery in Pune, India was bombed. Two Pakistani\
  \ terrorist groups, Lashkar-e-Taiba Al Alami and the Mujahideen Islami Muslim FrontI\
  \ claimed they made the attack. I happened to escape that fated day.\n    The week\
  \ of the bombing I emailed my friend, an Indian agori or cemetery sadhu. Sadhus\
  \ are holy men who leave behind their material possessions in search of enlightenment.\
  \ I told my friend to get a phone. He said ok and gave me his new number. \n   \
  \ February 13th, I called him to meet me at the German Bakery.\n    He arrived.\
  \ \u201CLet\u2019s get out of here.\u201D Yeah, lets go!  Down the street we entered\
  \ the Royal Cafe. Empty. Number of customers? Two. In India everyone loves their\
  \ chai, it\u2019s a dietary staple. You order it and within seconds you\u2019re\
  \ sipping it. We ordered. Minutes passed. I asked my friend more on being an agori.\
  \ Maybe I\u2019d take it up someday. The night breeze broke relief from the Indian\
  \ heat. \u201CIt\u2019s been 25 minutes,\u201D he said. We were going to head back\
  \ to the bakery.\n    Finally. With a smile the waiter put one chai for my friend,\
  \ then me. Boom! Startled we looked into each other's eyes. My friend spoke my words\
  \ of denial, \u201CIt was probably a car.\u201D I nodded.\n\u201CLet things settle\
  \ and then we\u2019ll check,\u201D he said.  \n    Ten minutes passed and men came\
  \ rushing into our cafe. My friend checked things out. Someone lost a piece of his\
  \ nose, blood covered his head. \n    We rushed out of the cafe. A crowd of chaos.\
  \ The Bakery shredded to pieces. Holding my hand we walked to the cafe. It was dark,\
  \ nothing but ruble. I was standing in a pool of blood. A cell phone rang. I was\
  \ in shock. A man stopped me from picking it up. We walked out.\n    A cup of chai\
  \ saved our lives. What about our friends? Was divine intervention in play for the\
  \ two of us? \n    Right now someone in the world just lost a loved one. My friend\
  \ got to continue his journey, our friends weren\u2019t at the cafe, I sit here\
  \ writing about the last thing I expected. \n    It\u2019s easy to get caught up\
  \ in the daily struggles of life, it\u2019s easy to take our loved ones fore-granted.\
  \ The people who survived had a special Valentines whether or not they had someone\
  \ to celebrate with, they were alive! I\u2019ve never had a special Valentine, but\
  \ Valentines 2010 I appreciated my Indian misfit friends more than ever and fell\
  \ in awww of life."
