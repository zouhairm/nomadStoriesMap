Text: "Shivers along my spine, fingers barely moving from the cold, raindrops dripping\
  \ on my face. I\u2019ve been standing under this shed for 15min. Watching couples\
  \ under their shared umbrella heroically standing in line to get the Best Beignets\
  \ and caf\xE9 au lait of town. \nI need another plan. \nI start running on the almost\
  \ empty streets of the French Quarter. The rain is pouring with an intensity that\u2019\
  s making the city decide to cancel the Mardi Gras opening parade. Not finding another\
  \ shed to hide I run into a second-hand bookstore.\n  \nTwo stories full of grandma-smelling\
  \ books. I start skimming along thousands of books. Giggling that the LGBT book\
  \ section is in between Catholic and Muslim books. Suddenly my eyes catch Eat, Pray,\
  \ Love. A moment that makes me feel like the world is actually round; things come\
  \ together and make sense in a way that\u2019s hard to describe to someone else.\
  \ Yet here I try. \n\nThe day before I finished Big Magic by Elizabeth Gilbert.\
  \ A book about her creative journey of writing Eat, Pray, Love. While reading Big\
  \ Magic, my buried creativity revived. Ideas that had been flowing unnoticeably\
  \ in my mind were falling into place. It took me 28 years to unlock my creativity.\
  \  \nThe old man behind the counter meticulously wrote down 4,50$ into his notebook,\
  \ that seemed as old as himself. Struck by this scene, and perhaps the unwillingness\
  \ to dive back into the thunderstorms of NOLA, I ask him: \u201CHow long have you\
  \ worked in this bookstore?\u201D\n\nAn hour later I was a fascinating story richer.\
  \ Garry, a charming wrinkled narrator, shared how reading a book about a woman with\
  \ a book-wagon who traveled across the USA inspired him to open his own bookstore\
  \ 60 years ago. His first attempt in Baton Rouge failed miserably, urging him to\
  \ work for a bookstore for 7 long years. With a 60$/week salary and 60$/month rent\
  \ he finally saved enough for a second attempt. He has accumulated a treasure of\
  \ books, and his passion has been invigorating NOLA with the most visited dog- and\
  \ beer-friendly bookstore. His answer when asked if he wrote a book? \u201COh no,\
  \ I\u2019m not intelligent enough! I can write words, but nothing as smart as the\
  \ books I love reading.\u201D\n\nI departed my solo train travel to explore my creative\
  \ living, and here I am putting into words one of many remarkable stories that enriched\
  \ my journey. With a long expedition ahead to learn how to turn words into a story\
  \ worthy to be called a book, I\u2019m curious to the many interesting destinations\
  \ I will explore along the way."
