Text: "I was in a field trip with two classmates from the technical course of tourism\
  \ guide I used to do, it was one of our last assignments before we could graduate,\
  \ and our job was to choose a touristic place and document it in video, showing\
  \ how people leaved there, the characteristics that made the place unique. We chose\
  \ the county of Raposa, that is 30 km from the capital of the state of Maranh\xE3\
  o, Saint Louis.\n The county is known for being the biggest fishing colony of Maranh\xE3\
  o and for having beautiful beaches and dunes with it's sand white and hot under\
  \ our feet. By the beach we could see the fishermen's boats far away while the sunlight\
  \ reflected in the water and later we discovered that they also make boat trips\
  \ with the tourists that have interest in going to the mangroves, to know the handmade\
  \ form to cultivate oysters and to bathe in the beaches.  \nWalking through the\
  \ streets we could see small restaurants and markets selling typical food that consisted\
  \ mostly from different kinds of seafood besides the simple stilt houses that form\
  \ a kind of unique urban complex in Raposa since they're buildings that stand on\
  \ wooden stakes to keep houses from being washed away or flooded by rivers or tide.\n\
  \ At the main street, called Hall of the Lacemakers was where the lacemakers exposed\
  \ their handicraft, which contained table cloths, dish cloths, beach outlets, curtains\
  \ and a lot more even though the stretch doesn't even reach a kilometer. From the\
  \ other side of the street I saw a lady working, her fingers were fast and agile\
  \ while she intertwined the laces one in the other. I was completely mesmerized\
  \ by her talent and we started talking, Ms. Maria  told me that being a lacemaker\
  \ is something that started a long time ago when the first fishermen's wives arrived\
  \ in the colony from another state, Cear\xE1, and that the women there learn it\
  \ since very young. The knowledge has been passed through generations of mothers\
  \ and daughters and it's one of the greatest attractions for tourists while their\
  \ work also helps to complement their families income.  \n Although their lives\
  \ are simple, Ms. Maria seemed happy and proud of her work, she was incredibly friendly\
  \ and gentle and made us feel as if we were long time friends. In that day I learned\
  \ that you don't really need much to be happy if you do what you love. The experience\
  \ felt very rewarding to me and, sometimes, I still think about Ms. Maria and how\
  \ I wish to go back there to hear and learn more from her stories."
