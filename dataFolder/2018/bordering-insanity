Text: "It wasn\u2019t going anywhere. I had to move fast. Exploring Buenos Aires had\
  \ already been sacrificed, and there was a distinct possibility of missing my flight\
  \ home. My options were not tempting. Inescapable agony, stuck on a coach to BA,\
  \ for 30 straight hours. Finding a dentist, whose price and methods I\u2019d be\
  \ rolling a dice on. Self-medication. Hmm. If it was to be a stab in the dark, I\u2019\
  d sooner take the metaphorical one. I strolled toward the green cross, impersonating\
  \ calmness while the rhythmic shocks of pain punched into my upper right gum. The\
  \ sun had begun to fall, and the sudden chill took me by the bare arms.\n\nIt\u2019\
  s hard to guess what effect winter has in a land made of salt. The lunar backdrop\
  \ betrays no hint of life, nor its impending return. But in the town, sparse and\
  \ clinging to the vast desert floor like a remnant carcass, there was a lingering\
  \ greyness surely left by the visiting cold, as it nightly scoured the stone moonscape.\
  \ I had never felt so far from my own world.\n\nI\u2019d been gritting my teeth\
  \ and swallowing on repeat, since the infection had taken hold. But as I slunk inside\
  \ the door and offered my pre-rehearsed \"Hola'' even more feebly than usual, this\
  \ time it was very much psychological. The owner grunted a formal reply, eyeing\
  \ me suspiciously. Clearly I wasn\u2019t the first stuttering young chancer to visit\
  \ his Bolivian drugstore.\n\nLike everything else, the shop was square. Square walls,\
  \ square roads, built to withstand storms of biting dust. There were boxes stacked\
  \ unevenly along all walls, and a wood counter that ran the entire width of the\
  \ room. A sprinkling of sand coated the weathered floorboards, just enough to leave\
  \ scuff marks as I edged closer.\n\nI smiled. As a Brit, the smile is a risky gambit,\
  \ for we tend to assume other cultures will be as appreciative of social niceties\
  \ as we are. He stared back. Bereft of faux confidence, I bashfully proceeded in\
  \ English. \u201CMy gum \u2013 it hurts here\u201D. I fishhooked my upper lip, pointing\
  \ to show the throbbing red lump beneath. \u201COkay. Is it your gum or also your\
  \ tooth?\u201D I blushed again, having openly doubted the linguistic capability\
  \ of a qualified pharmacist, in a town beset by international tourists. \u201CI\u2019\
  m not sure,\u201D I whooshed from between my exposed teeth and index finger. \u201C\
  But I think I need some antibiotics\u201D.\n\nI left giddy at the low prices, cradling\
  \ not just antibiotics, but a box of sleeping pills and some industrial strength\
  \ painkillers, to boot. The next 24 hours were hazy, to say the least."
