Text: "It was 5.30am when Jan and I left our tiny hostel in San Pedro, Guatemala.\
  \ The first purple rays of sunlight pervaded the otherwise black sky. A few women\
  \ bent forward for their heavy loads shuffled through the narrow alleys. My boyfriend\
  \ and I were enjoying the fresh morning air since it was a steep hike up to the\
  \ Volc\xE1n San Pedro and we got hot really fast. By the time we reached the entrance\
  \ of the national park the sun was already up. It was a beautiful scenery. We walked\
  \ through green coffee plantations and lush vegetation. From time to time we came\
  \ across a farmer that carried woods down to San Pedro. It was incredible how they\
  \ seemed to handle the weight so easily when I almost hadn't the strength to go\
  \ up the volcano with my small backpack. The further we went up the higher the trees\
  \ grew - vegetation changed from wet tropical forest to dry conifers. Meanwhile\
  \ Jan constantly had to spark me off to continue climbing. The hike was merciless.\
  \ Our only glimpse of hope were the wooden signs next to the trail that came up\
  \ every 100 metres in altitude. I was wet with sweat and couldn't think of anything\
  \ else than the peak and that it was hopefully worth the effort. It was at 2600m\
  \ altitude when I began counting the time between the signs. With shaking and burning\
  \ knees we finally reached the peak at 3020m altitude one hour later. We got to\
  \ a plateau of huge rocks. The view was breathtaking. You could see all of Lago\
  \ Atitl\xE1n - the vulcanic lake - and its surrounding villages, every shade of\
  \ blue in the mystic waters. We were so high that fog patches swirled past us and\
  \ engulfed us. It was amazing - I forgot my hurting legs and how I had cursed all\
  \ the way up. I was imbued with joy and awe. Hypnotized from the view. It was not\
  \ until I looked to my left that I realized two men standing there, dressed up all\
  \ black and with pump guns in their hands. The magic was over and my dream began.\
  \ Our peace was shattered by harsh shouts:\"Money! Camera! Phone! Money!\". The\
  \ two masked men knew what they did. One pointed at us with his pump gun and the\
  \ other one held open a dirty gym bag. \"Money! Camera! Phone!\". Happy to have\
  \ a phone I already stretched out my hands to hand it over. They were so close.\
  \ I never saw a gun before. It was unreal. I could see his dark, frantic eyes through\
  \ his mask. Everything seemed so loud even though I never tried to breath that quiet.\
  \ The next time I looked up they were gone, just like another fog patch."
