Text: "I was wearing my longest socks and had pulled them as high as I could when\
  \ I walked out of the Kathmandu Airport in my flip-flops. Soon I would be hiking\
  \ around 8000 meter peaks for several weeks and the only proper mountain gear I\
  \ had was my waterproof jacket. Coming weeks were spent looking for fake branded\
  \ trekking shoes and clothing while exploring the narrow and hectic streets of the\
  \ capital of Nepal.\n\nI took the trekking maps title 'Around Annapurna\u2019 literally\
  \ and started my hike from Pohkara instead of the usual Besisahar. Unfortunately\
  \ none of the maps for sale covered the forgotten southern leg of the route. During\
  \ my first dhal bhat meal of the trek the owner of the teahouse came to the rescue.\
  \ He wrote down the names of the villages I should get to before Besisahar and the\
  \ edge of my map. With the help of locals I didn\u2019t get lost until the third\
  \ evening. I had hiked down the wrong side of a ridge and it was getting dark. A\
  \ kind-hearted family invited me in to their home, fed me and made me sleep next\
  \ to the stove where their grandma usually rested.\n\nSurrounded by some of the\
  \ highest peaks in the world it was at times hard to stay concentrated on the actual\
  \ walking and instead be immersed into enjoying the scenery. Early on I gave myself\
  \ a rule not to walk and look at the mountains simultaneously. Stumbling was not\
  \ an option while alone in the mountains.\n\nI expected the landscape to be breathtaking\
  \ but a different kind of beauty emerged when the camera was stored away and eyes\
  \ were pointing towards the ground. Fixed concentration to movement lead the mind\
  \ to a state of meditation, a space outside the realm of the mountains. Thoughts\
  \ slowed down, got silenced and what remained was the sound of the howling winds\
  \ coming through the valleys and over the surrounding peaks. A rhythm emerged from\
  \ the pace of the steps.\n\nAs the days went by having breaks to rest and take photos\
  \ became harder. Weeks of walking in the mountains had made my legs stronger. Each\
  \ step became more precise and intuitive allowing me to walk faster and further.\
  \ I was hooked.\n\nApproaching New Years Eve and infected frostbites in my fingers\
  \ were enough of an excuse to head down from the mountains. It was few hours before\
  \ the end of the year as I returned to Pohkara. Dust and pollution was floating\
  \ in the air and the streets were packed with people. Four monks were sitting on\
  \ a wide doorstep holding parts of their orange ropes to cover their mouths and\
  \ noses. I couldn\u2019t stop walking."
