Text: "I was never the adventurous type. Up to last year, I had always travelled accompanied,\
  \ but on my to-do list \u2018travelling alone\u2019 was one of the top goals. I\
  \ looked at it often thinking it was a pipe dream that I would never have the courage\
  \ to act upon.\nBut then, something changed. On my 25th birthday, a fire of \u2018\
  carpe diem\u2019 started burning. I decided that not only was I going to spend my\
  \ birthday abroad, I was doing it alone\u2026 in Amsterdam. My family and friends\
  \ went bananas. \u201CAre you crazy?\u201D, they asked. Some just stared: \u201C\
  You?\u201D. They didn\u2019t understand what happened to that fearful little girl.\
  \ \nI won\u2019t lie: it was mortifying. Booking things online, from the safety\
  \ of my computer at home, was ok. Arriving in Amsterdam and deciding what to do\
  \ next\u2026 Not so much. But, the magic is, it all turned out fine. I had an amazing\
  \ flight with KML (there was even a white chocolate muffin in the menu served),\
  \ my taxi driver was friendly enough to give me an unpaid tour of the city and the\
  \ hotel was so central I could walk pretty much everywhere. After that one moment\
  \ of panic (\u2018OMG, what now?\u2019), I collected myself, said \u2018Danny, you\
  \ can do this\u2019 and off I went to discover the city.\nNot surprisingly, I fell\
  \ in love with it. Amsterdam, for me, was never about the free pot or the Red Light\
  \ District, as it is for most European youngsters. It was about the art. The landscape\
  \ with its beautiful bridges above the canal, the colourful bicycles everywhere\
  \ you looked (and look you must or you will be run over) and the amazingly crafted\
  \ souvenirs all of which I wanted to bring home. But, most of all, Amsterdam was\
  \ about Vincent Van Gogh, a man with no formal education but that in 10 years, with\
  \ hard work and perseverance, managed to create hundreds of masterpieces. One of\
  \ them stands majestic in the Van Gogh\u2019s Museum: the sunflowers. The mixture\
  \ of colours, the different yellows, is so perfect\u2026 it led me to tears. \n\
  My trip lasted only a few days but it felt like a lifetime. For once, I found myself\
  \ really enjoying it. The best moment? Right after I left the museum, I sat down\
  \ on one of the benches of the Museum Square. From there, I could see the \u2018\
  I amsterdam\u2019 letters. I could see the kids and youngsters trying to get the\
  \ perfect photo, climbing the letters and balancing themselves, no fear. I could\
  \ see groups of friends, laughing, telling stories and\u2026 dancing. The sun was\
  \ setting and I thought to myself \u2018it doesn\u2019t get any better than this\u2019\
