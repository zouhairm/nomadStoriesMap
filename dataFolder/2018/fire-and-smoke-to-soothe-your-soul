Text: "Food they say is the way to a mans heart. Well I would say travel and  food\
  \ definitely finds a way to a mans soul. We had heard of this place long before\
  \ arriving in Vietnam, so after tasting the amazing street food in Hanoi and the\
  \ healthy detox potions in Danang. We made our way south by overnight train to Nha\
  \ Trang. Waving goodbye to Mikie our martial arts berth buddy, off to his new job\
  \ and new home, we tripped into the blistering heat that is Nha Trang. A busy thriving\
  \ resort popular with Russians and Australians, it\u2019s long sandy beach has many\
  \ places to stop for a beer in the shade.  Lach Canh was recommended by friends\
  \ back home so that evening map in hand we went searching. Found it after a quite\
  \ a few wrong turns down side streets. Two story\u2019s unassuming with lots of\
  \ smoke and steam coming from the open windows. It was jam packed full of local\
  \ people and the odd tourist.   Finding a table up the stairs that wouldn\u2019\
  t past any health and safety tests we ordered our rice, chicken and beef. Looking\
  \ around every table had its own portable fire bellowing smoke and heat around the\
  \ room. Small pots with a gauge on top to cook your food, and underneath coals and\
  \ fire. The heat was intense, the smoke everywhere and full of people. Young and\
  \ old chatting away like they were in McDonald\u2019s in a Saturday afternoon. Beers\
  \ flowed at 25pence a go. We tried to order a portion of rice each but the man gestured\
  \ not too and then we found out why, it arrived in a large bowl a bit like the washing\
  \ up bowl full to the brim. Along with our raw meat marinating in a spicy dip. It\
  \ went straight on the fire, everybody wanting to be the chef by now. Every so often\
  \ a breeze sent the smoke and flames into our faces. We ate as we cooked, drank\
  \ more beers , stoked our fire cooked and ate some more. The rice which never seems\
  \ to decrease it was just never ending. With a full belly, smoke filled hair and\
  \ clothes and a warm face we put up the white flag. A place like this would never\
  \ happen at home, 20 ish open fires in the hands of beer filled adults and small\
  \ children, not to mention the fire escape staircase. We paid our bill, less than\
  \ ten pounds for all night and escaped into the sea air for a midnight walk on the\
  \ beach. Walking past the bars and restaurants we knew it was definitely worth the\
  \ trip and the highlight of our Vietnam food discovery so far."
