Text: "GITARAMA, Rwanda \u2014 Standing on the orange earth of Kacyiru bus station\
  \ in central Kigali, over a hundred teenage students wait impatiently to get moving.\
  \ It\u2019s eight o\u2019clock in the morning and already almost 80 degrees. Once\
  \ everyone has crammed into the buses we head west in convoy, the maze of new high-rise\
  \ buildings and old bungalows rapidly giving way to rolling hills and mile upon\
  \ mile of agricultural terraces. Every inch of land appears to be under cultivation.\
  \ \u201CThe land shortage is a big problem,\u201D the student sitting beside me\
  \ observes.\n\n\niDebate\u2019s students come from a range of backgrounds. On the\
  \ bus I recognize a student from the previous year\u2019s camp, the daughter of\
  \ a parliamentarian. Beside her sits Maxim, who tells me \u201Cmy school was going\
  \ to pay for me to come, but it didn\u2019t work out so I sold my goat. It was worth\
  \ it \u2014 you can\u2019t put a price on the future.\u201D\n\nDebating is practiced\
  \ worldwide as an intellectual game. Here it is seen in practical terms.\n\nOne\
  \ key topic is the issue of youth unemployment. Mekka, an aspiring politician, proposes\
  \ what becomes the class consensus: \u201CWe need to make jobs ourselves. If you\
  \ have skills, start a business that uses those skills.\u201D These students are\
  \ nothing if not ambitious. A survey of their aspirations reveals a wide variety\
  \ of pursuits, from architect to doctor to software engineer and even to pilot.\
  \ \u201CI will be the CEO of an architectural and construction firm,\u201D writes\
  \ Stella (a Harvard freshman).\n\nIt should not be surprising that these young Rwandans\
  \ are so self-motivated. Many lost their extended families during the 1994 genocide.\
  \ Some are already heads of their household. Some grew up in exile. And although\
  \ most were born three or four years after the genocide, none have escaped its shadow.\
  \ Jean Michel Habineza, one of the founders of iDebate and the son of Rwanda\u2019\
  s Minister for Sport and Culture, believes that \u201Cthe biggest victims of genocide\
  \ were us \u2014 the young people \u2014 because we are all bearing the consequences\
  \ of something that we did not create.\u201D He started iDebate in part to break\
  \ what he views as a pervasive unwillingness to question authority. (In the photo\
  \ above, Rwandans commemorate the 20th anniversary of the genocide in April 2014.)"
