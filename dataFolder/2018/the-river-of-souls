Text: "On my far right I could see fire giving way to screams and sadness. It was\
  \ 5 am, Monday, as we crossed Harishchandra Ghat, flowers floated lined up with\
  \ diyas, creating an unimaginable hue. A man wept in the back while a Pandit, dressed\
  \ in white dhoti, kept chanting. I was in the middle of Ganga, Varanasi, oldest\
  \ surviving city in India. I closed my book and tugged it to my heart. She looked\
  \ at me unblinkingly, eyeing my absurd attire and torn pages of the book I held\
  \ so close and fast. I ignored her, avoiding any chance of conversation.\n\u201C\
  Are you here alone?\u201D\n\u201CYes.\u201D I replied.  \u201CMy name is Radha.\u201D\
  \  She said she was 15. Her hair was blond, not naturally, but bleached from dust\
  \ and lack of care, smudged in the back, torn and fierce. She was dressed in rags\
  \ smelling of fish. Surprisingly, she was a student, at public school. When she\
  \ rowed her father\u2019s boat, her blue bangles clanged together. Radha talked\
  \ about her father, an alcoholic old man, as if he was a mere story. She lived in\
  \ a house which leaked in monsoon, with her mother who worked odd-jobs at the Moksha\
  \ Bhawan (death hostel). The constitution might have made education a fundamental\
  \ right, but in reality all of Radha\u2019s friends were working. The kids drop\
  \ out after 5, and the girls get married by 18. In this city of aesthetics, often\
  \ unnoticed are numerous bowls of beggars, waiting to be filled with the coins of\
  \ mercy, kids as young as three walk barefoot, beg for money and food. The book\
  \ stalls are always empty. The water was blue here, but banks stood corrupted.\n\
  Kids played gilli-danda  on a Ghat, another was scattered with the religious enthusiasts,\
  \ taking the morning dip, kids splashing water, pot bellied old men in boxers peeking\
  \ at young girls, and middle aged ladies in petticoat and blouse, smirking at couples.\
  \ I was at the heart of the largest successful democracy in the world, or was I?\n\
  Radha took me to Gauri-Kedareshwar temple, the white marble floor was wet and painted\
  \ with dirty footprints of the visitors, and milk flowed down the shivling in the\
  \ drain while her 3 year old brother stood watching.\nRadha told me she wanted her\
  \ mother to give up the odds jobs. The sun moved up and the Siberian birds flew\
  \ along the horizon, inclining beautifully under the blue sky. She smiled, her hazel\
  \ eyes looked golden.\n\u201CI want to buy a new house too.\u201D She spoke inaudibly.\n\
  These birds fly a long way away from home every year just to escape the inhabitable\
  \ conditions back home. I wish we could do the same."
