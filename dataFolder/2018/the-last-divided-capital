Text: "I left my sandals on the doorstep and entered the mosque quietly. There were\
  \ no decorations except the ones surrounding their version of an altar. I couldn\u2019\
  t help but have a weird feeling, as I was a woman in a place of worship that serves\
  \ a religion which, as far as I knew, doesn\u2019t really appreciate women. My chain\
  \ of thoughts was interrupted by the Imam, who was a guy probably just a few years\
  \ older than I was and who seemed pretty modern underneath his beard and traditional\
  \ clothes. An hour later I was sitting on a stone bench at the entrance of the mosque,\
  \ my hair and legs covered by different scarves while sipping fresh cold water I\
  \ had just received from my new friend.  \n Yunnis, the Turkish Imam who was serving\
  \ this mosque in the Greek part of Nicosia was answering life\u2019s big questions\
  \ and giving me a great insight into the Islamic religion, while telling me about\
  \ his secular life and the German girlfriend he once had. I cannot even remember\
  \ how and when, he just started answering all the burning questions that I had started\
  \ asking myself that summer. I had recently gone through a very bad break-up that\
  \ left me nearly broke and homeless, not to mention broken hearted, and which raised\
  \ a ton of very intriguing questions about who I really was. It seemed as though\
  \ Yunnis had read all that on my face, because he started telling me about happiness\
  \ and what can we do to be happy. His answer was of course, Allah and his sayings.\
  \ Apparently, in my friend\u2019s view, Allah had a \u201Cbluetooth,\u201D which\
  \ he could use to get us all in tune, listen to all our cares and needs and help\
  \ us, and all we had to do was turn that bluetooth on. Then there was also the \u201C\
  simple\u201D recipe to being happy: just follow Allah\u2019s words and just do what\
  \ he says, just do good. My morale uplifted and my understanding of islamism deepened,\
  \ I finally set off to make my way back to the station. I bid farewell to Yunnis,\
  \ feeling as if I was parting from a childhood friend.Following his advice, I plucked\
  \ some flowers from a bush in the garden and added them to my water, as he had told\
  \ me they would make my water sweet and fresh. I left the mosque having Allah by\
  \ my side as I had heard my friend whisper behind me: \u201CSalaam Alaikum.\u201D\
  \ \n Although I visited Cyprus one more time after that, I never went back to the\
  \ mosque. I somehow didn\u2019t want to break the spell. I have this weird idea\
  \ that if I would go there again\u2026I would find a new Imam who would tell me\
  \ that they had no Yunnis serving there."
