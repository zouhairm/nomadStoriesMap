Text: "My husband and I aren\u2019t big socialisers, we generally keep to ourselves.\
  \ I couldn\u2019t tell you our neighbours names. It\u2019s strange though, how when\
  \ you travel most people are more open to a conversation and being social. \n\n\
  On a glorious summer afternoon in San Sebasti\xE1n we were sitting on the steps\
  \ of a church in the old town across from the Atari bar enjoying a drink - being\
  \ a child of the 80\u2019s It was easy to remember the name of the bar. As the clear\
  \ blue sky turned to a pink twilight we were watching the tourists come and go from\
  \ the surrounding pintxos bars. Two young guys sit down next to us and completely\
  \ out of character my husband points at the two good looking young girls sitting\
  \ in front of us and says \u201CTwo guys, two girls, it\u2019s a perfect match\u201D\
  . His match making skills weren\u2019t so good, the girls weren\u2019t interested.\
  \ The guys, were school friends home from university for the weekend, they were\
  \ keen to have a chat to practice their English with us and attempted to teach us\
  \ some Spanish. We were bad students. \n\nI learnt more about Spain\u2019s history,\
  \ its people and the local Basque political and economic struggles in that evening\
  \ than I\u2019ve learnt from any guide book or tour, all because of my husband stepped\
  \ out of his comfort zone for a moment - I\u2019m sure the local beer and wine helped!\
  \ \n\nI felt completely safe, as if I was among friends I'd know for years, however\
  \ it hasn\u2019t always been like this in San Sebasti\xE1n. In the recent past,\
  \ the presence of military police was a necessity to keep the peace. Standing in\
  \ the street drinking like we were now, wasn't possible. I came to understand the\
  \ difficulties the youth of Spain experience in finding a job, even with a degree\
  \ and the ability to speak fluent English. They were all from large families of\
  \ ten plus children. The Global Financial Crisis hit them hard and the country was\
  \ still recovering. Despite their struggles they were proud and happy people. \n\
  \nThe group grew bigger and louder as more of their friends joined us. I'm not sure\
  \ how the neighbours living in the apartments above ever get any sleep? After many\
  \ drinks and laughs, the sun was long gone and the bar was closing. We said farewell\
  \ as they rolled us into a taxi to make sure we made it safely back to our hotel.\
  \ I should have been a better student when they were teaching us Spanish."
