Text: "It was Easter Sunday. \n\nThat\u2019s when the phone call came.\n\nI had been\
  \ in Mexico City on business; I only returned home 2 weeks earlier. My associate\
  \ was flying out Monday morning to follow up with the people I had met.\n\nThe gist\
  \ of the phone call was my associate had an extra plane ticket. The interpreter\
  \ accompanying him had just cancelled. He asked if I would consider flying out tomorrow\
  \ with him. This was pre 9/11. Changing names on tickets was possible then. My wife\
  \ had been to Mexico City with me, and knew all of the people involved. She was\
  \ familiar with the business, its potential, and thought it was a good opportunity.\
  \ I, on the other hand, had reservations. Strong reservations.\n\nFirst, the logical\
  \ reasons: leaving home again so soon, we had 3 children 5 and under, I would have\
  \ no income while away, it was at least a 4-month commitment, and I knew only a\
  \ couple of people there. The bigger problem for me, what, in truth, really scared\
  \ me? The only Spanish I spoke was \u201Cgracias\u201D and \u201Cadios.\u201D\n\n\
  There are opportune moments when a door opens, and the only thing blocking you from\
  \ stepping through is fear. Real or not, if you are fearful of what is on the other\
  \ side, to you it is real. At that moment a decision must be made. Do you push through\
  \ that fear or do you back away, letting that opportunity slide by?\n\nI made my\
  \ decision, pushed past my fear, and walked through that door.\n\nI ended up living\
  \ in Mexico City for a year, only able to afford to go home twice during that time.\
  \ I traveled the country by train, plane, bus, and car, fortunate to meet hundreds\
  \ of people. Many invited me into their homes, to celebrate baptisms, quinceaneras,\
  \ birthdays, and family dinners, giving me a depth of understanding of the culture\
  \ and history of the country that mere travel to locations could not provide.\n\n\
  This journey was lasting much longer than expected. Another decision needed to be\
  \ made. I either bring my family to Mexico, or I return and let go of the business.\
  \ Weighing all the pros and cons, I made the decision: I let the business go.\n\n\
  Actively keeping an open mind and not loosing sight of what is important in life\
  \ is difficult. Our perspective can easily be skewed and others\u2019 perspectives\
  \ are often easily misunderstood or disregarded without even realizing it happened.\n\
  \nOne decision to board a plane was a stone dropped in a pond. The ripple effect\
  \ created multiple situations pushing me past fears and through new doors.\n\nWhat\
  \ a wonderful lesson to learn."
