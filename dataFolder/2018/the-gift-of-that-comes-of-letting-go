Text: "Each footstep stole the breath from my lungs. My eyes focused on the dizzying,\
  \ moonscape of North Base Camp, Everest and the fluttering red, white, blue, green\
  \ and yellow prayer flags. I had caught mountain fever that swept through Lhasa.\
  \  At 4,980 metres, the worlds largest peak lay illusively behind cloud cover. I\
  \ followed haunting voices to the Rongbul Monastery, my presence accepted by every\
  \ chanting monk. The distinct faces of fifteen shaven-headed boys slowly emerged\
  \ as my eyes adjusted to the dim light. One oval faced boy emerging into manhood\
  \ motioned me to a flattened pillow. The boy of eleven to my right eagerly pointed\
  \ to the text; he sounded each inked word gently instructing me. His generous offer\
  \ allowed a break from the chant and his face settled into a drifting memory.  I\
  \ watched whispers swirl together, mixing with the dance of the incense that dance.\
  \ Individually they sang a communal song. A pair of monks prepared tea.  A chubby\
  \ child sang more joyously as the tea came nearer, his eyes were focused on the\
  \ biscuits.  Assuming invisibility of the young, he grabbed extra squares, stuffing\
  \ them into the folds of his robes. I smiled at his hunger, aware of the comfort\
  \ food offers when far from one\u2019s family. \nLater, I shared Yak Butter tea\
  \ with a Tibetan guide, who reminded me the image of the Dalai Lama could land the\
  \ possessor in jail. The slightly sour taste glided down my throat.  I awoke from\
  \ under the weight of blankets with my stomach churning. Slipping on my jacket I\
  \ snuck outs scrambling over the rocks before vomiting violently. I felt the empty,\
  \ refreshed feeling that comes from releasing the traveler\u2019s stomach bug. I\
  \ raised my eyes to see the moonlit peak, magnificence dwarfing me; the sky was\
  \ mine alone.\nI kept the midnight screening to myself, descending the hill. The\
  \ truck grumbled to a halt at a refueling station. I entered the dim lit tent, my\
  \ eyes adjusting to a Tibetan shepherd. He wore the oversized traditional coral\
  \ and turquoise ring braided into his long, black hair.  He asked to see my guidebook\
  \ and touched each picture lovingly.  Without any thought of worry, I slipped a\
  \ picture of the Dalai Lama into the pages. He sensed my compassion and with one\
  \ invisible movement swept the photo into his robe next to his lungs. He bowed with\
  \ a deliberate, delicate smile exiting the tent. I finished my meal and withdrew\
  \ into the openness. Looking up at the rocky mountainside, I saw the  man retreating\
  \ into the expansive universe."
