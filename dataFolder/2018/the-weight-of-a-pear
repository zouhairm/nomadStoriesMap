Text: "I found myself in Taiwan, pouring fertiliser onto rows and rows of pear trees.\
  \ Each bag of fertiliser weighed at least 20 kilograms, and each bag catered to\
  \ just three pear trees. I cut open each bag with a penknife, dumped the little\
  \ brown pellets of fertiliser into a pail, and used a small plastic scoop to distribute\
  \ them evenly across the entire farm. And then I did it again, and again, as the\
  \ cool morning air gradually gave way to the brutal sun at noon. \n\nMy friends\
  \ and I were at the farm to learn from the pear farmers that resided in Shigang.\
  \ We were to follow them for a day or two, following them as they went about their\
  \ daily farming routine. We all donned the same gear: pink arm sleeves that sheltered\
  \ you from the sun, a farmer's balaclava, and an old olive-green T-shirt complemented\
  \ by an even older pair of faded blue jeans. The piece de resistance were these\
  \ garish orange boots that were just a little too big for my feet, so they squeaked\
  \ with each clumsy step that I took. \n\nIt was in this horrid cacophony of colours\
  \ that I stumbled about the slopes of the pear farm, trying my best to manoeuvre\
  \ under the short branches of each pear tree. My back was bent for almost the entirety\
  \ of this experience, and with each bag of fertiliser and I was exhausted by the\
  \ first hour - my body entirely unprepared for the gruelling work despite my youth.\n\
  \nUntil my host called out loudly: \"Rest time!\" \n\nWe gathered around and sat\
  \ on our pails, and she shared with us some oranges that she had just plucked off\
  \ her neighbour's orange tree. She assured us that it wasn't stealing because her\
  \ neighbour was not just her neighbour - he was her 'big brother', not bonded by\
  \ blood but by the simple fact that they had lived beside one another for the past\
  \ 20 years. She shared her pears with him, and he let her take as many oranges as\
  \ she liked. Coming from an entirely foreign city, I was startled by this display\
  \ of kinship. Each one of the other farmers I met on this trip was equally kind\
  \ and generous - always smiling while they fed us dish after dish after dish. They\
  \ called us their 'sons and daughters', and the oranges I had on that break were\
  \ the sweetest I had ever tasted. \n\nA week later, I found myself at the check-in\
  \ counter, my bag no heavier than it was when I left home. Yet, I felt like I was\
  \ bringing back so much more. People make a place a home, and I found myself a family.\
  \ Hopefully, my bags weigh a few pears heavier the next time."
