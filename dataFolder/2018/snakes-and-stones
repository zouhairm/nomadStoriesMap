Text: "My identity is heavily entwined with my religion, The Baha'i Faith, which among\
  \ other things encourages youths to dedicate a year of their life to full time service.\
  \ Service can be to humanity, communities or religious institutions usually outside\
  \ the country of your residence. This idea, from a young age, had taken root deep\
  \ within my soul. However when the time for harvest came, I missed the first opportunity\
  \ I was offered, in pursuit of financial goals. \nMy home town community has a very\
  \ one dimensional approach to life, study to work, work to make a family, make a\
  \ family to die with dignity, and do it as fast as possible. Anyone who even considers\
  \ a different approach to life is met with resistance. And that resistance is what\
  \ led to this decision that left me feeling conflicted.\nAs a young adult, the decision\
  \ to take a year off from life, led to heavy internal debate, and eventual that\
  \ deep seeded root finally sprouted a plant and finally decided to take a year off\
  \ from university. With limited funds I moved to Sydney at the Australian Baha'i\
  \ Temple for a year to serve primarily in cleaning  and maintenance of the venue.\
  \ Coming from a country where cheap paid help is woven in the fabric of day to day\
  \ life, it was a challenge to overcome my inflated ego and work as a voluntary janitor\
  \ amongst other things. But seeing how even janitors were treated as equals in Australia,\
  \ unlike in my country where they are look down upon, opened up my eyes. I realized\
  \ the biases and barrier I had created within my own head, but with more exposure\
  \ to the Australians I changed my views on a multitude of things. That one-dimensional\
  \ way of thinking that my home-town followed as doctrine seemed to be losing its\
  \ grasp on me. \nDuring the course of the year I absorbed a few peculiarly Australian\
  \ habits which I still carry on to this day. I experienced alot of wildlife related\
  \ incidents, during my stay, but after 6 months of close encounter with deadly and\
  \ non lethal snakes, spider and monitor lizard, I got over my fear and actually\
  \ enjoyed their company at times. Reptiles are good listeners, especial on hot humid\
  \ days. \nEventually near the end of my trip I met my future wife. A Norwegian Baha'i\
  \ who in pursuit of her own spiritual growth walked a path that intersected mine,\
  \ half way across the world. Everything she loved about me was the result of the\
  \ assimilation of my year long experiences in Australia. The last thing I expected\
  \ was to find my life partner on this continent."
