Text: "The heat was intense. Viscous air. The sun dripped liquid rays of jungle light\
  \ that bit into exposed flesh. Nature\u2019s fingers had crafted trees feeding greedily\
  \ from the hot, wet sky - trees that grew so densely and thrived haphazardly in\
  \ shallow soil, their gangly legs splayed in attempted balance.\n\nIt was here in\
  \ the jungles of Borneo that I experienced my most extreme outdoor trek, stomping\
  \ through the hazy wildness and wilderness with a group of keen, naive millennials.\
  \ We were entirely in the hands of our mysterious, monolingual jungle guide, Petrus,\
  \ who floated effortlessly through the foliage. The air was still, solid. Time ran\
  \ slower. Petrus shouted some stern but encouraging words in Malay and beckoned\
  \ us on.\n\nTrees stood as soldiers at every path, armed with vicious plants whose\
  \ open mouths grinned. Far on a sketchy horizon charcoal clouds formed, their bass\
  \ mutter tumbling slowly through the air. A tropical storm was brewing. Fatigued\
  \ by the long trek, we were in no shape to face the storm. Petrus sighed at the\
  \ snail pace of his guests before taking a machete to the green expanse to our left.\
  \ The heavy drops began to tumble on our sweat-soaked sunhats and our blood-stained\
  \ shirts (the leeches had taken a liking to our sweet English blood). We were running\
  \ on empty as we stumbled through the squelching mud, sundown fast approaching.\n\
  \nI remember glancing up at Petrus ahead of me, his deep oak eyes filled with compassion.\
  \ He offered a strong, calloused hand to aid me over the last obstacle before home.\
  \ Since we hadn\u2019t reached the clearing to set up camp, he was welcoming us\
  \ into his chalet on stilts. A small but assertive-looking woman marched towards\
  \ us waving her hands and gesturing that we remove our reeking clothes and shoes\
  \ before setting foot in her delightful abode. Drunk with tiredness we obliged,\
  \ digging out some semi-clean attire from the depths of our backpacks as the storm\
  \ bellowed above. We climbed into a merry interior filled with Petrus\u2019 family,\
  \ ushered in by the assertive woman who thrust bowls of hot, rich food in front\
  \ of us as we collapsed at the table of this jungle oasis. We thanked Petrus and\
  \ his wife with our broken Malay and exhausted smiles. The last thing I remember\
  \ before falling asleep on my battered roll-mat on the floor of a wooden cabin three\
  \ thousand miles from home is the sweet laughter of Petrus\u2019 children and the\
  \ cheerful sound of a home-crafted guitar attempting the chords of Wonderwall."
