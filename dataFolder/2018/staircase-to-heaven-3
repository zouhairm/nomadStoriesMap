Text: "Hot! Even though there was\_a shade\_above me, sunlight bordering only the\
  \ area, warm and wet spotted floor beneath me, I was on fire. Or was it my nervousness,\
  \ which seemed to echo ablaze and frame thousands of\_heavyset feelings in my stomach.\n\
  Words hailed for the flume I had come to be, were \u2018wildest, Poseidon revenge\u2019\
  . It has a chamber where the ground would give away, rocketing you nearly vertical\
  \ to the bottom. That was Dubai, more than a mere tourist attraction. This deserted\
  \ land was unique\_through its\_urban-rural\_vibrant blend, vast expatriated people\
  \ abode in tranquil or with its icy cold\_indoors and hot outdoors.\n\u201CThe ride\
  \ is a thrilling experience\u201D elucidated a competent mate over dinner.\n\u201C\
  It gets you_ um_\u201D\_ \n\u201CShaking\u201D offered a scared listener.\n\"Intimate\
  \ with your fear.\" He established shrewdly. \n\u201CYou give fear your undivided\
  \ attention, endure them, act against it and it gifts you with strength and courage.\u201D\
  \nUp on top, two inescapable pods loom uprightly. But the aura up there was reassuringly\
  \ sanguine. I had been greeted with cheeky smiles, knowing looks are shared, kindred\
  \ bond were formed between a few of us who had dared to be tough as nail. One minute\
  \ a woman in the pod had horror written on her face,\_scream strangled by the casket.\
  \ The next second I was there getting my weight checked.\nSuddenly all my humor\
  \ suffocated, I step into the capsule and my heart skipped a beat. The moment that\
  \ trapdoor started getting shut, a strange voice radiates from the core of mind\
  \ somewhere between a cry and yells. It's an angry, vexed, the sound of your brio\
  \ mounting off nap and shouting \u201CYou don\u2019t want to be here.\u201D \nI\
  \ didn\u2019t care I had crossed 11 never ending flight of stairs. Emotions raged\
  \ within me so intense I could canvas my own face without a mirror. The woman with\
  \ whom I had been exchanging excited luck had terrified wide eyes, just like mine\
  \ were desperate. The instant I heard countdown my mind went blank. My hearing intensified\
  \ to a level that I had a bat eye, all I could sense was to hear aqua gushing by\
  \ and the numbers.\nWith a bang I flew in air at a speed so great that the water\
  \ guzzled my face. Those two second felt forever, two frozen seconds, which left\
  \ me in control of nothing. Somewhere along the line, smiles\_had buzzed back to\
  \ my face. Although I don't know if it was due to relief or heady delight, I knew\
  \ this time it won\u2019t be wiped off."
