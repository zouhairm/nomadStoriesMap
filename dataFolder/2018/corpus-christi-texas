Text: "It is hot and humid. The music is loud and full of \u201Cfucks\u201D, complimented\
  \ by the almost louder cricket's chirping down here in Corpus Christi, Texas. I\
  \ am at a party. It is a typical college party. The only thing not typical: the\
  \ various accents you can hear tonight. The colorful group I am here with comes\
  \ from all over the world, individuals connected through the nameless feeling of\
  \ being a stranger in the rough land of Texas.\n\nThere is Hochi from China, who\
  \ calls herself Ela and lives with her older sister, who came here to receive inspiration\
  \ for her art. There is Masaki, a chubby Japanese guy, who was convinced by an American\
  \ friend to study in Corpus Christi and be his roommate. There is Giovanna, a laid-back\
  \ Brazilian girl, just like you would imagine a laid-back Brazilian girl. There\
  \ is Cebe, who calls himself Jared, whose father is a famous TV presenter back in\
  \ Turkey. There is Kyle from South Korea, who stays with his cousin and who misses\
  \ his girlfriend a lot. And there is Ana, who is always proud to tell that she is\
  \ from Montenegro and never tired to explain, where to find that little country\
  \ on a world map.\n\nCommunication surely is difficult. Nevertheless they all loosen\
  \ up and mingle around all the Americans, as soon as Giovanna lightens a little\
  \ joint. Mixed with everyone else at this crowded party, it is hard to recognize\
  \ the foreigners. Nevertheless, they stick out. The numerous stories they have to\
  \ tell are different. Hochi tells about her father, who forced her to leave China\
  \ to become more independent. Masaki speaks about his fear of going back to his\
  \ home town, ever since the earthquake and following tsunami of 2011 hit Japan.\
  \ Kyle also shares his worries, but not about catastrophes, his are about what might\
  \ happen to him whenever he tries to enter South Korea again, since he came to the\
  \ US to avoid being forced to join the military. Giovanna scares most people off\
  \ as soon as she talks about her true passion \u2013 drugs.\nMeanwhile Cebe and\
  \ Ana chatter about their work at the mall. They sell perfumes and sun glasses for\
  \ a bald Persian business man who seems to only hire employees who are illegally\
  \ in the country and thus willing to work illegally for him.\n\nAnd then there is\
  \ me - Uwe, the German - also here because of some odd reason. On this night, I\
  \ learn that there is one more connection we all share - we are all new and unexpected\
  \ locals to Corpus Christi,Texas."
