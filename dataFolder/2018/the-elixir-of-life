Text: "The Elixir of Life \nThe most important thing in life is to breathe, let go\
  \ and enjoy the ride.\n\nAlmost all of us have a bucket list with things and experiences\
  \ that maybe we want to accomplish one day or at one point, with the hope that we\
  \ will be happier or it will make our lives more fulfilled.\nIt was a warm summer\
  \ morning in Torremolinos, Malaga and I was walking on a spacious sidewalk. I was\
  \ a bit nervous and excited at the same time. In about thirty minutes I was there,\
  \ right on time for my short training for what I was about to do next. We were eleven\
  \ people and I was the only girl, brave enough to learn about breathing techniques\
  \ and how to dive safely. I don\u2019t think I have ever heard the word comfortable\
  \ said so many times during a one-hour lesson.\nHow can you feel comfortable when\
  \ you know your life is hanging by a thread or in that case by an oxygen tube? I\
  \ was just about to find out.\nShortly after the briefing we embarked on a road\
  \ trip towards Nerja, a very picturesque city, in the south of Spain. The calm white\
  \ houses and pink flower gardens which were lying on the abrupt cliffs were facing\
  \ the beautiful blue sea which was waiting for us with its arms wide open. I felt\
  \ courageous.\nEven after five of my scuba diving buddies gave up and returned,\
  \ I still felt confident and I knew I have to do this. After a struggle and getting\
  \ blisters on my middle and ring fingers, I had my wet suit on and I was ready to\
  \ get heavier. There were thirty-five degrees Celsius outside, I was covered from\
  \ neck to toes, I was wearing a weight belt around my waist and the oxygen tank\
  \ was weighting me down, but I was so thrilled of getting in the water. \nThe cool\
  \ feeling against my skin and wet suit relaxed me instantly and I felt weightless.\
  \ The noise stopped suddenly and I was able to see clearly underwater. Where did\
  \ all the sounds and the ability to communicate go? How can I breathe and be under\
  \ the water at the same time? My brain couldn\u2019t comprehend that for a moment.\
  \ I panicked! I heard a voice soon after, telling me to relax, focus and that I\
  \ can do this. It was my instructor who gave me confidence. I had to make a fast\
  \ decision, am I going ahead or am I giving up?\nI took a deep breath and here I\
  \ was, under the water, letting go completely, knowing that each second is important\
  \ and if I lose my focus I wouldn\u2019t be able to continue. My life depended on\
  \ each breath of oxygen I was taking. Breathe, let go and enjoy the ride or the\
  \ swim, in this case. It was superb."
