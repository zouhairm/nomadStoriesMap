  \  around the world just to have another view, to find our likes and may be our\
  \ love, this is my story and i will tell you, why since 2014 my life changed,Once\
  \ you touch the world, you change for ever and i didnt know that was gonna happend\
  \ to me after my firts trip to  Mexico in 2014 into the real Mexico, im not talking\
  \ about going to a hotel, restaurant and to have all this easy and nice life, all\
  \ this confort,im talking about to discover the real world, to have a different\
  \ prespective and this what happened to me.\nOn january 23 2014 i was lying down\
  \ in my bed thinking about my pass and all the things that i have done, i remember\
  \ that in my mind was passing all the memories from my childhood, all the activities\
  \ that i was doing, all the trophies that I won in sports etc, and i remember that\
  \ i was feeling very empty inside, i knew i did  really nice things according to\
  \ the society, i finished the university, i had my own Company , everybody was proud\
  \ of me, well at least that's what they were saying,but i was feeling completely\
  \ empty, no because i failed or because i did something wrong, i didnt know why,\
  \ i remember i was thinking what i always wanted to do, and nothing came to my mind\
  \ i was like this, for over one month, even i was asking persons if they were completely\
  \ happy wich 100% of them they were telling me that not really 100% , wich for me\
  \ didnt make any sense at all, why not 100% why?.\nThen i decided to travel to take\
  \ a break so i took my bagpack and left everything for a month thats what i did.\
  \ I went from the sea to the mountains, from the jungle to the deserts, to surf\
  \ and to climb mountains, once i was climbing one mountain until i reached the top\
  \ and i remember how happy i was feeling, how completely, even that i was all alone\
  \ i couldnt imagine how beautiful was my country and how much time i have lost being\
  \ 80% happy and from this moment i knew how i could be 100% happy.I came home with\
  \ a decisi\xF3n, a decisioin to be 100% and not 80% from that day until now, my\
  \ life has changed, i been living in over 5 different countries,i have visited more\
  \ than 34 countries, i even met the love of my life and im not talking about a mountain\
  \ or a beach a real girl and the most important thing since that day i have been\
  \ 100% happy. This is what i have been doing with passion and intensity, i know\
  \ its a complicated fusi\xF3n but this is the mystique i adore, is the beating heart\
  \ of those special places."
