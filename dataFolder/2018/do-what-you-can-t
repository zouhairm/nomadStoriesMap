Text: "I accept that going Traveling is one of the adventurous thing. It is a challenge\
  \ toward our-self and looking for a new thing. In the year 2018 I decided to face\
  \ with one adventurous. I have traveled a lot. I have not traveled a rough journey\
  \ like the Adventure persons. But early in the beginning of the year I have successfully\
  \ done a thing which I have never done before. Correct. It was Hiking to the highest\
  \ mountain in east Shan State. It was the first challenge journey I have done in\
  \ 2018.\n\nIn  order to reach the top the length of the path is about (9) miles\
  \ long. The normal duration of hiking takes about (6) to (8) hours. I have to hike\
  \ for about  (9:30) hours. Before i went to the top of the mountain, I have to passed\
  \ through a big forest in final stage.  I liked that forest most. It is the Taung\
  \ Sa lat forest. The forest is very dense with full of other big trees and Taung\
  \ Sa lat trees. These trees are not growing here and there but only the whole forest\
  \ is covered with the flowers of Taung Sa Lt. The petals of Taung Sa lat flowers\
  \ that fall on the ground naturally look all red on the ground.  The evening is\
  \ beautiful. The early morning scene cover with mist is also beautiful. The beauties\
  \ are like the movie of Twilight in which the scene looks like Dark-brownish. Actually\
  \ it was really very beautiful. I have thought that as it is really very beautiful\
  \ that it thrive as reserve forest where the top is not easy to reach. After passing\
  \ through that patch of forest we successfully reached the  top of the mountain.\
  \ \n\nWhen we reached the top of the mountain the sun is starting to sink. But I\
  \ was able to reach the top before sun set and i could manage my traveling time.\
  \ I have smiled all the way from traveling down the path. I satisfied myself fully\
  \ by forgetting the pain and aching of my body. The achievement is due to building\
  \ of self- confidence and endurance. Some say that with the exception of traveling,\
  \ I have no endurance for doing thing. I am strong in self character regarding traveling.\
  \ I did attain my desire. I did not travel bodily alone but traveled with my own\
  \ heart and strong spirit and achieved at the end although the trip was very hard\
  \ journey and hard. I have reached it. I adopt my desire as a person who cannot\
  \ stay without traveling. It is the best basic roots for reaching the final destiny.\
  \ I will continue to carry on any of my life journeys with the strong determination\
  \ and spirit. Because I was borne for that sort of traveling."
