Text: "\u2018Welcome to Athens! Please let me help with your luggage, and take a seat.\u2019\
  \ said Babis, my taxi driver who had been waiting for me outside the airport just\
  \ after I landed at midnight. It was my first breath of the Greek air, the air of\
  \ liberty, which felt so nostalgic and hospitable. We laughed when I went straight\
  \ to the left side of the car, without thinking on which side of the road do Greeks\
  \ drive, only to find the steering wheel sitting quietly in front of the seat.\n\
  Babis started the car, as well as our conversation. I was always curious about Athenians\u2019\
  \ experiences of the recession, being right at the centre of their parliamentarians\u2019\
  \ debates and the protests at Syndagma Square. \u2018People are still doing it tough.\u2019\
  \ said Babis, \u2018There is constantly a gap between the needs for government\u2019\
  s social security measures and the amount of tax people pay, which caused our government\
  \ to go bankrupt.\u2019 From his words, I could feel the hardship experienced by\
  \ ordinary Greeks, and their complaint about big businesses and well-off individuals\
  \ that shun their tax obligations, exacerbating the deficit.\nWhat intrigued me\
  \ even more is how the historical monuments are preserved, and what lessons we can\
  \ learn from them. What about the barren rocky hill of Areopagus, on which Apostle\
  \ Paul preached about the Unknown God? Or the Panathenaic Way, through which festive\
  \ parades and sporting events were frequently held? Or Plato\u2019s Academy, a school\
  \ of wisdom that was detested by the authority for \u2018corrupting the minds of\
  \ the youths\u2019? And where did Pericles deliver his famous Eulogy of the city\u2019\
  s fallen heroes, who defended the democracy so hard yet in vain?\n\u2018You can\
  \ see this monastery beside our motorway, called \u201CKaisariani Monastery\u201D\
  , which is still welcoming pilgrims. It played its part in supporting the Greek\
  \ soldiers during the anti-Nazi resistance.\u2019 replies Babis, \u2018Near Syndagma\
  \ Square, you will see Aristotle\u2019s Lyceum, which is similar to the Academy,\
  \ while the Agora (market) and Kerameikos cemetery are both within walking distance\
  \ from your hotel.\u2019\n\u2018What about your traditions of moderation and love\
  \ of honour?\u2019 I enquired.\n\u2018From what you said, it seems you are well-prepared.\
  \ You will see for yourself!\u2019 says Babis with a smile. I was dropped off in\
  \ front of my hotel when I reminded him it\u2019s time for me to pay for the trip!\
  \ Looking around, I found myself amidst fine diners on the streets, or on rooftops,\
  \ enjoying their last course with the Parthenon in the backdrop, at 1am."
