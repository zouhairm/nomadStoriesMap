Text: "Bells from the Belfry of Bruges echo down the half-tunnel of brick and cobblestone.\
  \ They get louder, as sounds do when you\u2019re waking up. You could be mistaken\
  \ for thinking they\u2019re from the Church of Our Lady. Her spires preside above\
  \ the rampart, though somehow it already feels as if you\u2019re in the hall of\
  \ a cathedral.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s because Bruges is the result of a missed bus to\
  \ Paris, but I feel like my heart and eyes are open to it. I notice my top button\
  \ is undone, showing my Sigur R\xF3s undershirt. I go to do it up, but then I have\
  \ an idea. What if I undid a button every time this city impressed me? If I undo\
  \ the last five by the end of five hours, I\u2019m moving to Bruges.\n\nI follow\
  \ the canals which give this city the nickname \u2018Venice of the North\u2019.\
  \ For eight euros, a guide will ferry you under low bridges to the Lake of Love.\
  \ As a punishment for his capture, the emperor Maximilian sentenced Bruges to house\
  \ his emblem of swans for eternity. Today, they glide along the lake like creatures\
  \ in no rush to leave. The couples in our crew go straight to the Lover\u2019s Bridge\
  \ after the ride, but I head into \u2018t Brugs Beertjepub with one less button.\n\
  \nInside \u2018Bruges\u2019 Little Bear\u2019, the excessive boast of 300 Belgian\
  \ beers is echoed by the old-timey posters and strings of coloured-paper bears covering\
  \ every inch of space. \u201CThis one\u2019s local,\u201D the bartender says. I\
  \ pretend to weigh up the other options before ordering a glass. The amount he pours\
  \ seems stingy before I realise this is quadruple-strength beer; it might as well\
  \ be a martini. Despite this, it\u2019s warm, smooth and tastes like coffee.\n\n\
  I set off down the straat to digest the button-worthy beverage. Here, three separate\
  \ festivals have melded into one celebration of culture and community. Market stalls\
  \ line both sides of the street from Markt Place to the city walls, selling knick-knacks\
  \ and paperbacks. I march along the middle of the road with old locals, lesbian\
  \ couples and horse-drawn carriages as if we were a parade. Bruges is called an\
  \ open-air museum, but it is alive with blood pumping through its vessels of cobblestone\
  \ and water. \n\nOutside the city walls, verdant hills and blue sky meet in a line\
  \ punctuated by windmills. There\u2019s nothing to suggest this isn\u2019t a 13th\
  \ century Flemish town until the hill drops and I see the bus station. I\u2019m\
  \ in no rush to get there; I\u2019ve come to look forward to the mistakes and wrong\
  \ turns.\n\nI have one button left, but would I have unbuttoned any if I\u2019d\
  \ planned on visiting Bruges?"
