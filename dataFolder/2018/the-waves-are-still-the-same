Text: "On the way to the more celebrated beaches of Galle and Mirissa lived the quiet\
  \ air and violent waves of Hikkaduwa. This beach was known for its tourism and coral\
  \ reefs. The sea and its people spent their routine undisturbed and unfettered in\
  \ the presence of natural decay and low income. In the past decade, fewer tourists\
  \ had been visiting every year, so businesses were mediocre and life ordinary. Like\
  \ us, most people ended up there by word-of-mouth. \n\nWhen we enter, a young girl\
  \ wearing a long, plaited skirt and an unforgettable smile opens her home. One could\
  \ tell that she was nervous, standing next to her parents who didn\u2019t speak\
  \ any English. When it got dark, the kitchen began to smell of raw fish and the\
  \ symphony of the waves thrummed in the silent backyard. \n\nSrilankans prefer fish\
  \ as a source of protein. The fisheries sector not only takes care of food consumption\
  \ for a majority of the population, but also contributes to 2% of the GDP. It employs\
  \ more than a million people. In 2009, the Tsunami had destroyed much of the country,\
  \ including two-thirds of its coastline. More than 80 percent of active fishers\
  \ were affected and 75 percent of the fishing fleet was damaged. Hikkaduwa was one\
  \ of the most devastated regions.\n\n\u201CDinner and cold beer?\u201D mama asked\
  \ us. \n\u201CYes!\u201D I smiled.\n\nFor mama\u2019s family, airbnb was an important\
  \ source of income. A family of a retired army officer, a housewife and two daughters,\
  \ they struggled to make ends meet. They made sure to get our consistent feedback.\
  \ \u201CFood good?\u201D the mother asked every day. \u201CBathroom clean?\u201D\
  \ she would enquire. \n\nOne could tell that mama really enjoying hosting people\
  \ from all over the world. Given that the people in Hikkaduwa earned most of their\
  \ income from tourism and fisheries, the small attempts of running an airbnb sprang\
  \ from hope. It worked as long as the tourists kept coming and the natural ecosystem\
  \ thrived. But with the fast-degrading environment in the recent years, tourism\
  \ had declined. \n\nWe, my American friend and I, got to know the family over the\
  \ dining table. Over morning chai (tea) that we prepared in their kitchen, we had\
  \ conversations with the girls about their work and India. On the second day, they\
  \ called us didis (sisters).\n\nThose who were wide-eyed strangers at first became\
  \ friends. For us travelers, that was a real promise and left us with a sense of\
  \ self-discovery."
