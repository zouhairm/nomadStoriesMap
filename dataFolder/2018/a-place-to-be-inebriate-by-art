Text: "Cuba is a country that surprised me in many ways. I was expecting a country\
  \ that would take me back in time, but instead I found myself experiencing a country\
  \ that is being destroyed by time. The colorful postcards of Cuba hide the fetid\
  \ streets and derelict buildings. Through many conversations I found that people\
  \ still live without freedom. They are too scared to speak up against their government,\
  \ especially in the touristic areas, as they know that they are being watched. Guides\
  \ describe Fidel as a great hero. Unfortunately, the promise of free food, education\
  \ and health is an illusion. The quality and quantity of food provided is not enough\
  \ to satisfy human's dietary requirements. If people fail to work for the government\
  \ after their graduation, their degree would be invalidated, but if they work for\
  \ the government, they would not be able to provide for their family. They are not\
  \ allowed to own businesses and cannot even breed and sell livestock. All the major\
  \ restaurants and business benefit either the government or foreign investors. Supermarkets\
  \ are almost empty and finding drinkable water can be a challenge.  \n\nEvery day\
  \ scenarios and conversations flipped most of my expectations. One of the few times\
  \ things turned out to be better than I expected was the night I spent at \"La F\xE1\
  brica de Arte Cubano\". I was expecting to go to a clubbing, but instead I found\
  \ myself in an incredible art project. The building started as Cuba's Electric Company,\
  \ then became a peanut oil factory, and nowadays it is used as an exhibition center.\
  \ It is a three-story building full of art installations. On the first floor they\
  \ had fashion and design exhibitions, as well as a jazz and heavy metal band playing\
  \ in different rooms. The singer of the heavy metal band jumped and twisted his\
  \ arms, head and legs at the same time. For the first time, I saw no distinction\
  \ between Cubans and tourists, as everyone was equally driven by the singer's energy.\
  \ In the top floors, there were visual arts expositions. These top floors converge\
  \ with a double-height ceiling, on which a video was projected whilst audiences\
  \ watched from eclectic sofas. A second wall was dedicated to photography, and the\
  \ third was behind a bar from which alcohol and coffee was served. The last wall\
  \ was a series of windows that lead to a rooftop. It was as if someone had disguised\
  \ an art museum as a nightclub. People there were inebriated with art without even\
  \ noticing."
