Text: "\u2018Volite se ljudo\u017Ederi\u2019, in English means \u201CLove each other,\
  \ cannibals.\u201D\n\nI saw this phrase a number of times graffitied on walls and\
  \ buildings across Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Many buildings and walls\
  \ were covered in either graffiti or artists attempts to cover up the graffiti.\
  \ A tour guide a few days earlier had mentioned that some of the graffiti dates\
  \ back to the early 90\u2019s and were either ethnically insensitive phrases or\
  \ anti-war sentiments. \n\nAlthough some of the graffiti was creatively incorporated\
  \ into art pieces and murals, some tags remained, as if seething scars serving as\
  \ haunting reminders of more turbulent times.The result was an eclectic and eccentric\
  \ fusion of miscellaneous figures and Croatian phrases. \n\nSam and I were en-route\
  \ to Prijedor in Bosnia and Herzegovina, for my childhood friends wedding. We had\
  \ spent a good deal of our trip so far on our phones, booking hotels, keeping in\
  \ contact with friends and family and mapping out our drive to Prijedor before he\
  \ came across articles on the Bosnian War, detailing the violence against the Muslim\
  \ Bosniaks.\n\nI never felt like people treated us differently as an inter-ethnic\
  \ couple.  Sam, a first generation Muslim- Canadian whose family came to Canada\
  \ from India and Africa, seemed quick to pick up on negative or hostile glances,\
  \ comments and tones of those less \u2018open-minded\u2019. Myself, being a second\
  \ generation Canadian with Scottish and Dutch heritage, was raised relatively ignorant\
  \ of the discrimination he would have faced growing up and bought heavily into the\
  \ whole \u201CCanadian Multi-Ethnic Mosaic\u201D allegory. I was often accused of\
  \ being insensitive when I assumed he was falsely picking up on hostility. \n\n\
  Were people going to be friendly? Or Cold?  Welcoming and inviting or spiteful and\
  \ dismissive?  I hadn\u2019t thought to mention the ethnicity of the date I was\
  \ bringing to the bride and groom. I wouldn\u2019t have thought twice about it if\
  \ I was in Canada, why would I in Europe? Was I ignorant? Naive? Comfortable? Or\
  \ just Canadian?\n\nThe drive itself was eventful enough to make us forget those\
  \ concerns. Our GPS died, our phones and google maps were unable to find our location,\
  \ we bought a map that we couldn't read and yet we somehow made it to Prijedor.\n\
  \nAs we drove through the dishevelled town centre, we noticed several mosques, gleaming\
  \ in the sunshine.  We didn't know where we were going. We drove slowly past a group\
  \ of old men who waved, smiling toothily, as if welcoming us into their town."
