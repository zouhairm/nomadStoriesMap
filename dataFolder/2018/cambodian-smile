Text: "My eyes are working over time, attempting to adjust to the moonlight above\
  \ and the artificial light from my guide\u2019s phone lighting the gravel path below.\
  \ My boots crunch along the pathway. Adding to the echo of the others, reminding\
  \ me this is not a private occasion. The humidity in the air has worked through\
  \ my first layer of clothing. Mosquitoes are lurking about as we approach the still\
  \ water. \nWithin moments, this semi-secluded temple of Angkor Wat is filled with\
  \ over a thousand people all vying for the perfect shot of the sunrise over this\
  \ 12th century behemoth with a mystical reflection off the water\u2019s edge. \n\
  \ The Khmer Rouge regime had led a genocide of the country from 1975-1978. The Killing\
  \ Field of Choeung Ek holds thousands of unmarked graves. The sun was high in the\
  \ sky. No one spoke. Our eyes darting from each others shoes, to the sky, to the\
  \ bus. Where do you begin with a topic of mass graves? \n In 2016, the museum built\
  \ a boardwalk around the killing fields. Before then tourists would often step upon\
  \ undiscovered bones in unmarked graves. This was disturbing but also concerning\
  \ to those documenting the lives lost, no records were kept as to whom was killed\
  \ where. \n As our group was lead through the site, one tree stood out among the\
  \ rest. Ribbons, thousands of colorful bracelets fluttered in the stale breeze.\
  \ Head sized knots crawled up the tree on all sides. The tree\u2019s branches reached\
  \ over a covered pit, walled by bamboo sticks, also endowed with hundreds of bracelets.\
  \ Some saying \u201CFriends Forever\u201D, some had words in a foreign tongue. This\
  \ was a grave. But there was joy surrounding this pit. Our guide told us, this was\
  \ the Killing Tree. Mother\u2019s would be forced to kneel before the tree and watch\
  \ as soldiers would bash their infant\u2019s heads against this tree until they\
  \ died. Then thrown into the grave. The mothers lead away and killed in a different\
  \ mass grave. \n We witnessed what the worst humanity had to offer with the Killing\
  \ Tree. And yet, when I traveled around Cambodia, all Cambodians, whether old or\
  \ young, teeth or no teeth. Cambodia\u2019s have a face that was designed to smile.\
  \ And each one has smiled at me. There is a reason there is joy surrounding that\
  \ grave site and that tree, because we have realized the atrocity that has happened\
  \ but the Cambodians are stronger. Their temples throughout the landscape show the\
  \ beauty and strength the reside within their souls. They know any stranger\u2019\
  s day can be made with a simple soulful smile."
