Text: "When I announced to my family that I would be visiting Rwanda to study the\
  \ process of truth and reconciliation, a very typical response emerged, that of\
  \ utmost concern for my safety in a country known only for its violence in the Western\
  \ world. However, what I found was quite different, as Rwanda has made an astounding\
  \ turn for the better in the decades since the genocide. My purpose was to study\
  \ the process of truth and reconciliation. The process is generally a commission\
  \ charged with revealing past crimes. The process hopes to help those affected by\
  \ the crimes involved become re-integrated with the community. In Rwanda, this process\
  \ was vital to the country\u2019s survival in the post-genocide situation. One of\
  \ the main reasons I chose to go to Rwanda was to hopefully discover how people\
  \ could be turned against their friends, neighbours, and even family, due to the\
  \ class divisions imposed on the nation during colonial times. I visited a village\
  \ where victims and genocidaires live together, which is not an uncommon setting\
  \ in Rwanda. In a local meeting hall, we gathered with community leaders and reformed\
  \ genocidaires who had been through the local truth and reconciliation process,\
  \ known in Rwanda as the gacaca court system. After a brief introduction from both\
  \ groups, one older gentleman explained his story as a genocidaire. He provided\
  \ us with some background on the beginning of the genocidal thought spreading throughout\
  \ the country. Believing it was \u201Ckill or be killed,\u201D the man and others\
  \ who shared the same ideology began the terrible 100 days of genocide that left\
  \ more than one million people dead. Speaking to his audience of my group and local\
  \ survivors, the man concluded his speech with the notion that the nation is no\
  \ longer separated along the divide that characterized the genocide, but rather\
  \ that \u201CWe are all Rwandan.\" This sentiment is common amongst survivors and\
  \ perpetrators and is a facet of the nation\u2019s recovery. While it is still hard\
  \ to grasp the causes and toll of the genocide, Rwanda has made astounding progress\
  \ under the Kagame administration, reflected in the forgiveness displayed when I\
  \ visited. Such healing in the face of political differences reminded me of the\
  \ importance of political unity in the face of adversity and trying times, something\
  \ that I have kept in mind while studying politics when we live in such a divisive\
  \ era. Even in North America, we could learn much about peace and reconciling our\
  \ past from the Rwandans."
