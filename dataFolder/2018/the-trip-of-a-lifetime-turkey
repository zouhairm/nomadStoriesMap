Text: "In July 2017 I came across an email in my University Postgraduate Inbox inviting\
  \ people to apply for a scholarship for a fully paid for trip to Turkey the following\
  \ month for a one-week duration. I was unsure if I should apply for this, as I had\
  \ not done much travel to countries closer to New Zealand let alone flying to the\
  \ other side of the world. I told my Dad about it, and he encouraged me to apply\
  \ for it as I had nothing to lose. So, I made the decision to apply for this scholarship,\
  \ which I considered to have pushed me to the edge as it was definitely out of my\
  \ comfort zone. In early August I received a phone call from Wellington, I answered\
  \ it, and to my disbelief I was told that I had won the scholarship to go to Turkey\
  \ for a week, all expenses paid. The conversation went along the lines of \u201C\
  I\u2019m going to make your day really good, we are giving you the scholarship to\
  \ go to Turkey for a week\u201D, \u201CREALLY?\u201D. I could not believe it, I\
  \ had never won anything like this before, I immediately rang my Dad to tell him\
  \ that I had won it, told my partner and updated my Facebook status to let my friends\
  \ and family know that I would be travelling all the way to Turkey! \nWe met with\
  \ another Australian Participant whom had previously lived in Istanbul so he knew\
  \ his way around, we got to the hotel and decided that we would give ourselves time\
  \ to freshen up and explore Istanbul on our own. The decision to apply for this\
  \ scholarship pushed me to the edge in this instance because I was unsure on how\
  \ to get around Istanbul and if it was safe to walk around by ourselves, we were\
  \ the only people that had arrived from the trip, but I went anyway. I honestly\
  \ felt like I was in a different world, it was so humbling being in a place where\
  \ no one spoke English, and it made me appreciate how culturally different this\
  \ planet is. After our exploration, we had a dinner with most of the participants\
  \ on the trip, in this instance I was pushed to the edge and leave my comfort zone\
  \ as I had to meet new people from around the world, I also found out that I was\
  \ the only kiwi on the trip. My favourite places that we visited were Topkapi Palace,\
  \ the Blue Mosque, the Basilica Cistern, the Hagia Sofia, Dolmabache Palace, Galata\
  \ Tower, the Grand Bazaar, the Ankara Castle, Alcatu, the Akropolis, Bergama and\
  \ the Ancient City of Ephesus."
