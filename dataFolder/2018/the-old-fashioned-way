Text: "When a Chinese man handed me a black notebook with a happy smile, I looked\
  \ at him confused. My ex boyfriend and I were wandering around Yangshuo in the hot\
  \ humid weather trying to find someone to guide us around. In a pretty good English,\
  \ Mobin introduced himself and asked us where we were from. When we answered, he\
  \ opened a page written in Italian. Whoever wrote it described Mobin as an awesome\
  \ guide that took them to amazing places. \nIt was like Tripadvisor, just on paper.\
  \ Brilliant.\nHe offered us the Yulong river experience at 250 yuan (35 \u20AC)\
  \ all-inclusive where men sail rafts using the human force. He convinced us to trust\
  \ him and the next morning we met at a bike rental. After each one of us chose a\
  \ bike, with his happy smile Mobin helped us riding thru the unpredictable Chinese\
  \ traffic. Just a 10-minute ride and we made it safely into the countryside. \n\
  Once at the river, we left our bikes with Mobin and we jumped on a wooden raft lead\
  \ by an old man. The river was calm but there were a couple of tiny waterfalls that\
  \ made the navigation more adventurous. \nAfter half an hour of breathtaking views,\
  \ we arrived at the landing point where Mobin was waiting for us with our bikes.\
  \ While riding, Mobin told us he was a sugar beet farmer living in a tiny village\
  \ close to Yangshuo that thanks to his English knowledge could bring home more money\
  \ to help his family. \nOur second stop was Moon Hill, so named for a wide hole\
  \ through the hill, once a limestone cave. An 800 steps climb. The view from the\
  \ top was breathtaking. The countryside looked like an endless field of knobby karst\
  \ hills.\nWe rode back to Yangshuo thru the countryside. We stopped several times\
  \ to take pictures because the hills made everything look unique and the Chinese\
  \ rural life fascinated us. \nSuddenly we arrived on a huge paved road with no cars.\
  \ Mobin told us that 10.000 people were planning to move there in the future. The\
  \ government was building roads and skyscrapers to host them. He didn\u2019t know\
  \ why but, with a sad face he told us that he liked where he lived the way it was.\
  \  Almost whispering it, he said that the government took the decision and nobody\
  \ could disagree with it. \nWith sadness in our hearts, we made it to Yangshuo.\
  \ After dropping off the bikes and paying Mobin, he asked us to leave him a review\
  \ on his black notebook. The only thing we could do was to write a 5 starts review\
  \ for that amazing sugar beet farmer that introduced us the real Chinese life."
