Text: "It was Saturday morning, I was heading towards Solang Valley. I had waited\
  \ for almost a year for this trek. Before starting the trek, I decided to stop for\
  \ breakfast. The paratha served with butter melted on top of it, was top notch.\
  \ The temperature was -1 degree Celsius, my hands were shaking while having those\
  \ parathas. \nHowever the scenes from that place, just helped me ignore the cold.\
  \ The snow clad mountains, people walking in with their family and friends, all\
  \ excited for the adventures in the Solang Valley. Entering the premises, there\
  \ was this big ground. People skiing on one side, a big queue for the gondola ride,\
  \ kids riding the ATV\u2019s, parachutes flying all over the mountains. It was all\
  \ a treat to the eyes. \nNot knowing the route, I decided to trek along with the\
  \ gondola cable. \u201CExcited\u201D, \u201Cnervous\u201D, \u201Cscared\u201D. All\
  \ these feelings were just juggling around me. The temperature was falling down\
  \ as I climbed up. Every step I took, softer the ice would get.\nWalking upwards,\
  \ gondola cables cars were continuously passing above me. After trekking for 2 hours,\
  \ it became very difficult to walk in the snow. The snow was very soft, almost half\
  \ of my leg was getting buried inside. \nMany questions were going through my mind.\
  \ Am I doing the right thing? Should I quit? Just negative thoughts. But some part\
  \ of me knew, how badly I wanted to be on the top. I just stopped near by a tree\
  \ for a while. While watching the view, a gondola cable car was passing above me.\
  \ A random lady was waving her hands down to me, all excited, happy, telling her\
  \ friends to look down. It was really weird, but at the same time it also felt good.\
  \ This was exactly the motivation I needed to continue this trek. It got me boosted\
  \ and after trekking for an hour I reached the top.\nEntering the area, I saw this\
  \ big board, which said \u201CYou are at 3200m, GET STOKED\u201D. It was the best\
  \ feelings ever. Though it was not a long trek, but I really felt proud of me.\n\
  I just went near the edge, sat down and started looking at the view. I had a perfect\
  \ date feeling, with me and all the snow around. A year long wait was totally worth\
  \ it.\nDon\u2019t ever regret your decisions. Things don\u2019t every time go according\
  \ to plan. They don\u2019t always happen how you expected them to be. It doesn\u2019\
  t mean you get all depressed and sad. It\u2019s all a part of the process. If anytime\
  \ in life you get demotivated, and don\u2019t get what you need, just stop for a\
  \ while and tell yourself just one thing,\nBECAUSE I BELIEVE SOMEDAY I WILL."
