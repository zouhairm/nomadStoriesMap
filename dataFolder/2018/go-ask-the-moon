Text: "Here\u2019s a fact that you may have discovered yourself: countries call us,\
  \ and not the other way round. \n\nSo I travelled out to India, where I lay sprawled\
  \ on cool sand at night, stargazing from the mandalas on my beach throw, and teaching\
  \ English at a primary school during the day.\nMy friendly young students were blatantly\
  \ curious, if somewhat wild in their enthusiasm to get to know me better.\n\nThis\
  \ morning, on the schoolbus, I rumble in my bag to show my favourite pupil, amber-eyed\
  \ Muin, a statuette of the Mayan goddess Ixchel, which I have bought in Mexico a\
  \ number of years ago. I hand it over to him. \n\u2018This is Ixchel, the goddess\
  \ of the moon\u2019, I explain. He fondles it gingerly, admiring the golden hue\
  \ in the obsidian. \u2018A moon goddess?\u2019 he murmurs. Then he looks up to me,\
  \ eyes brightening. \u2018Like Kali?\u2019\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 I smile. \u2018You\
  \ could say Kali is the indian version of her.\u2019\nThe other children start whooping\
  \ and shouting around us, and the little goddess is passed along beggingly outstretched\
  \ hands, is caressed with reverence by numerous grubby fingers. \n \nAnd somewhere\
  \ in South India, on a weekday in the twenty-first century, the once mighty Mayas\
  \ meet Krishna\u2019s newest generation on a schoolbus, I think bemused. \n\n\u2018\
  Ma\u2019am? Ma\u2019am? Show us you rings again?\u2019\nI hold up my hands obligingly.\
  \ They crowd around my seat in a rowdy mass of rucksacks and school uniforms, the\
  \ boys thumping each other, the girls\u2019 long braids swooshing; the smell of\
  \ cooking oil and Patanjali detergent, cumin and sindoor.\n\n\u2018Who remembers?\u2019\
  \ I ask them in my school teacher tone. \nLakshmi touches the moonstone on my ring\
  \ finger. \n\u2018England\u2026.\u2019\nHer finger counts down to my thumb, touching\
  \ all rings. \n\u2018Peru! Mexico! Nepal!\u2019 \nI switch hands. \n\u2018India!\
  \ France! Hungry!\u2019\nThey shriek with laughter.\n\n\u2018Ma\u2019am! Ma\u2019\
  am!\u2019 Muin shouts over them; I see shining amber, deep with curiosity.\n\u2018\
  What\u2019s the world like?\u2019\nI look out of the window, and their voices fade\
  \ into the soft-cottoned sounds of a dream within a dream.\n\nI think of the charm\
  \ I received from a solemn bedouin, sitting cross-legged under the tilted moon;\
  \ of the young boy in Ecuador who wanted to be a dolphin, and showed me a spondylus;\
  \ of the girl who took my hand to dance where the sun never sets.\n\n\u2018Well,\
  \ ask the moon\u2019, I say. \nThey laugh merrily, non-understandingly.\n\u2018\
  Hold her again, and now ask her to show you. She\u2019s been with me everywhere,\
  \ and everybody\u2019s touched her.\u2019 \nI stretch out the fertility goddess.\
  \ \n\u2018Want to say hi to the world?\u2019"
