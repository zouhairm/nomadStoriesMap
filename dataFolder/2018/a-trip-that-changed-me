Text: "I was 9 ,I am a beach person and when I\n saw LA  on TV I just had to go there\
  \ and I did a couple of months ago .I hadn't heard very great things about LA like\
  \ the traffic was terrible ,people are not friendly and that the place is just okay.\
  \ \n\n I was actually surprised and in a good way because all those things were\
  \ completely untrue, the people were very nice , friendly and accepting and the\
  \ traffic was not horrible either, as a matter of fact I fell in love with LA instantly.\n\
  \nLA has a very easy going vibe and the moment you step in you just feel joyous.\n\
  Ours was a 4 day trip and our first day started with Disneyland and spending a day\
  \ at Disneyland is practically a day spent in magicland just like every other kid\
  \ I too had a dream to visit  Disneyland and when I did I was overwhelmed seeing\
  \ Disney characters live in action took me back to my childhood days, talking about\
  \ the rides few days were amazing others not so much and the queue for rides are\
  \ really long so keep that in mind and where comfortable shoes. \n\nHollywood Boulevard\
  \ and Hollywood walk were completely different than what I had assumed they would\
  \ be , it wasn't as glamorous as I had thought but both places were pretty nice\
  \ especially the chocolate pastry Cafe which is at Vine Street near Hollywood walk\
  \ of Fame literally has the best selection of gourmet treats and their cheesecake\
  \ is just to die for and it's eastern European style Cafe .\n\nNext stop was Dolby\
  \ theatre where Oscars are held and it is an incredible place and our tour guide\
  \ showed us around and we were actually able to see the Oscar award behind the bar\
  \ and saw where famous selfies ever taken and felt a little bit famous myself so\
  \ if you are interested in theatre and stuff like that  it's a must go for you.\n\
  The only place in my entire life where I felt cheerful and bouyance from all my\
  \ heart is Santa Monica Pier .\n\nThe experience that I had there is somewhat hard\
  \ to explain and when you read it here you won't be able to understand it as you\
  \ have to be there to experience it.\n\nI personally believe not to have Pre-notions\
  \ about places or people  until or unless we judge it ourselves so now when I go\
  \ to a new place I go with a clean slate and I write my own experiences and thoughts\
  \ which are completely mine and not influenced by what others felt or experienced."
