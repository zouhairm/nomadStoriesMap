Text: "This story is not written with the intent to make you feel sorry for me. I\
  \ am flawed, just like everyone else & I'm only telling one side. The beginning\
  \ of 2017 was a brutal, f\u2019d-up, shit-show. I found out my partner of 10 years,\
  \ my husband, was cheating on me. I don\u2019t need to go into details. In fact\
  \ it\u2019s best I don\u2019t. Because I would love you to focus on the positive\
  \ aspects of this story; that while something can make you completely cray-cray,\
  \ it can also drive you. His actions and his decision to leave me, pushed me to\
  \ the edge, in every imaginable way. In my most distraught and darkest hours, I\
  \ wrote a list of things I still wanted to do in my life. Ways I could thrive. Now\
  \ this is where I\u2019m going to lose a few of you. You have stopped reading or\
  \ become distracted, because this now sounds like some sad-sack self help novel.\
  \ Option 1 bail out now. Option 2 pay bloody attention. This list made me realise\
  \ that my life had taken a turn into boring land. I had settled into mediocrity.\
  \ I don't blame him for this & I certainly don\u2019t hate myself for getting trapped\
  \ either. Suddenly his decision to leave the relationship, became a decision that\
  \ I felt was my own as well. So I decided to travel. Without too many plans or expectations.\
  \ To embrace the uncertainty of my future.\nUAE: Thanks for the exposure to a religion\
  \ I knew little about. For creating a fun way for me learn about expat life & the\
  \ opportunities your country provides.\nSpain: Thanks for helping me to enjoy the\
  \ taste of food again.\nPortugal: Thanks for the parties! I'll be back.\nMorocco:\
  \ Thanks for the unique landscapes. No thanks for the stomach bug.\nHungary: Thanks\
  \ for your awesome capital city, I could've stayed there forever drinking in dive\
  \ ruin bars.\nSlovakia: Thanks for the peace & quiet. An opportunity for rest &\
  \ explore my thoughts and feelings. Your public transport sucks though.\nCzech Republic:\
  \ Thanks for the insight into hostel work & learning to adventure on a shoestring!\n\
  Germany: Steins of beer that left my hands with bruises & quantities of food that\
  \ made me consider seeing a cardiovascular specialist. \nNetherlands: After an everlasting\
  \ summer, thumbs up for the cool weather and incessant rain.\nAustralia you cheeky\
  \ devil. I promise to explore more of you. I don\u2019t want to wait until I\u2019\
  m retired with grey hair & caravanning to appreciate you.\n12 months later I\u2019\
  m moving on. I'm more resilient than I\u2019ve ever been. More self loving. More\
  \ at peace. At 29 yrs old my life is starting again!"
