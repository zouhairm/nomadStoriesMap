  \ to make something happen\u2026 Few days back I said to myself I\u2019ll visit\
  \ 3 places in just one day.. it seems very impossible.. but I had all positive vibes\
  \ about it..I decided dates & asked my friends to join.. all backed out.. I asked\
  \ my cousins one of them said yes.. the moment he said yes I took my shoes out &\
  \ backpacked\u2026 Things went in such way that I could manage to visit just one\
  \ place which I have decided & captured that one pic which I wanted.. but more things\
  \ happened..\n  \n         I managed to visit 3 more undecided places & I camped\
  \ instead of just a Trek\u2026 I see this working for me\u2026 when you believe\
  \ to do things\u2026 It might not work in a way you want.. but it will definitely\
  \ work in way as you will love it anyway\u2026. Indeed it was a Adventure .. Camping\
