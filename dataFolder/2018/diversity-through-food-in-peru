Text: "\u201CMy father is Japanese and my mother is Inca,\u201D my cooking instructor,\
  \ Ebelin, said to me as we sat down to eat the food we had just made. We were sitting\
  \ in a beautiful dining room with dark wooden tables and sun spilling in from the\
  \ windows. We were somewhere in the hills of Cuzco, the town where most tourists\
  \ pass through enroute to Machu Picchu. Despite all the tourists thronging the city,\
  \ I felt like I was in a special hideaway - I was the only student that day.\n\n\
  The dish we were eating was lomo saltado \u2013 a classic Peruvian dish that was\
  \ derived from Chinese stir-fry. Within a moment, I had learned that Peru had very\
  \ longstanding connections with Asia \u2013 something that I hadn\u2019t expected\
  \ before coming to the land of the Incas. \n\nComing from Canada, with immigrant\
  \ parents from South Korea, I had always thoughts of countries like Canada, the\
  \ US, and Australia to be the main countries of immigration for people from Asia.\
  \ Immigrants from China and Japan go back several generations in these countries,\
  \ but the bulk of the immigration is more recent and from the past generation. Biracial\
  \ groups are rising, but they are still the minority. I realized this was not the\
  \ case is Peru and it was most obviously displayed in its food.\n\nBut don\u2019\
  t call it \u201Cfusion food.\u201D This is Peruvian food. And it is complex, simple,\
  \ hot, cold, spicy, sour, and sweet. Or simply: delicious. It\u2019s probably my\
  \ favourite food and that is not something I say lightly. It is an amazing emulsion\
  \ of Spanish, African, Chinese, and Japanese flavours. \n\n\u201CI have been to\
  \ Canada. I worked on a farm in the Okanagan,\u201D Ebelin said, surprising me again.\
  \ Not only did she have an Asia connection, but a Canadian connection as well. \u201C\
  We have a student from Quebec learning Peruvian food too.\u201D It is a small world.\
  \ \n\nOther dishes that I had the pleasure of making and tasting were a series of\
  \ amuse-bouches that included succulent and sour ceviche, smoked and salted guinea\
  \ pig slices, prettier-than-cake causa rellana, pisco sours, and an array of side\
  \ dishes that spanned the length of the table. The cherry-on-top came with surprise\
  \ desert \u2013 chocolate truffles. \n\n\u201CWe cannot bake cakes here because\
  \ of the elevation,\" Ebelin lamented. Yet another revelation to expand my understanding.\
  \ \"I hope to bake some nice cakes one day,\u201D she said when I showed her pictures\
  \ of cakes I had made. \n\"Maybe one day you will - in Canada!\" I proclaimed. \n\
  \"Yes maybe,\" she said, smiling."
