Text: "My travel story starts right back home, in Portugal. You know when you reach\
  \ this point where you are sure something has to change!? \u2013 that was my starting\
  \ point. By that time, I was officially a registered architect, I had worked solidly\
  \ for this company for 2 years, and simply it was not making sense to stay in this\
  \ position in life. It was time to take the plunge and to make a decision - by the\
  \ end of the contract I would travel to Indonesia. By taking this edgy decision\
  \ to quit my job, another edgy decision came to my mind \u2013 to take a Yoga Teacher\
  \ Training. Yoga has been an incredible way to keep my mind sane.\nHowever, I must\
  \ confess that I never thought about teaching yoga, I was not too bendy, I was not\
  \ all the stereotypes I had in mind about being a yoga teacher. Without thinking\
  \ too much I took the decision to embark in this crazy idea, thinking perhaps to\
  \ deepen my self-practice. October 2017, I begin this great adventure letting behind\
  \ a secure job and bringing with me many uncertainties. Once I arrived in Bali,\
  \ my dizziness stopped, I was not feeling sick anymore. Ubud is a special place,\
  \ it has a superior energy that allow us to balance our mind, spirituality and body.\
  \ It is said that only a few places in the world have this special alignment of\
  \ energies. \nWhile I was in the YTT, I stayed in a very modest hotel, the staff\
  \ made me feel like I was at home. Every morning I was greeted by Wang, who would\
  \ bring a delicious breakfast and wish me a wonderful day followed by a big smile.\
  \ His smile is so contagious that you feel like a great day is waiting for you.\
  \ From Bali I travelled to Gili and I visited the three islands. Gili has a different\
  \ environment, people do not smile as much as in Bali, but apart from some wedding\
  \ proposals I assure that if you are a solo traveller you will feel safe. When I\
  \ was in Gili T, I had this moment that like a friend of mine once said \u2018perfect\
  \ moment to take a mental snapshot\u2019. I was snorkelling and I met face-to-face\
  \ a turtle. Still today, it is difficult to think that it was real. I have never\
  \ seen one, it very gently moved towards me and with the same smoothness it disappeared\
  \ to the deep ocean. Perhaps, it was that moment who brought an epiphany and slowly\
  \ the idea of becoming a yoga teacher and working as a freelance architect started\
  \ to take shape. Nowadays, I am teaching in Vietnam and working remote as an architect.\
  \ I am here for 3 months and after I intend to continue my journey travelling the\
  \ world."
