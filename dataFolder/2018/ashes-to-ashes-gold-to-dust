Text: "Through the fairy tale woods, and down the postcard valley, walking along a\
  \ suspiciously yellow creek, I eagerly proceed on my first visit to the town we\
  \ had saved.\n\nI skip along rows of new houses, keen to find my camp site at the\
  \ Unitarian Church.\n \u2018This is Catholic\u2019\nA man grunts urging me to move\
  \ on. Houses give way to grey, communist flats that rise on the sides flanking the\
  \ road. On the sidewalk, a lady donning a house robe supervises her phone. Gazing\
  \ at me from across the scene, a peculiarly curvy church with two mushroom towers\
  \ catches my eye.\n\n\u2018Orthodox Church\u2019\nSo says the robed lady, picking\
  \ her eyes off the phone. \nI thank her and leave, accompanied by her attentive\
  \ gaze for a bit longer.\n\nThe road slithers up hill, left and right, and the communist\
  \ buildings morph into a peculiar mix of old cottages and belle \xE9poque homes.\
  \ Dusty and grey, many of the pretties lay bare their not so belle bricks. Among\
  \ them, an architectural apparition dressed in sun-bleached cloth, with a computer\
  \ rendition of the renovated facade yet to come. Relics of a house. \n\nA glare\
  \ brushes my shoulder as a local walks by. He wears the green and yellow regalia\
  \ of the corporation, and judging from its worn-out look, the memory of that affair\
  \ is still alive for the last of the miners.\n\nMy contemplation is cut short by\
  \ a sanctuary presenting itself around the corner. I approach its gate, yearning\
  \ rest under the shade of the white, glossy walls, only to stop at the sign:\n\u2018\
  Reformed Church\u2019\n\nUphill, more spectres arise, cloths desperately clinging\
  \ to their carcasses, all torn like the golden dreams that they promised. I shudder.\n\
  \nIn a memory from five years past, we marched the capital\u2019s streets by the\
  \ thousands. \u2018United we save!\u2019  voices cried vibrating in desperate frustration.\
  \ This town would not be sold to foreign corporations, and would not be mined with\
  \ cyanide or otherwise.\n\nToday my voice shrank inside my throat. Nothing here\
  \ would hint at the fact that you're walking on mountains of gold. 300 tons to be\
  \ exact- a price that once promised this town a much needed coat of paint and a\
  \ few jobs. Some crumbling houses bare the UNESCO mark. My breath grows heavy; as\
  \ do my backpack and my thoughts. Perhaps it\u2019s the hill.\n\nI walk past the\
  \ town market \u2013 empty, past the tourist office \u2013 closed, past the mining\
  \ museum \u2013 never opened. Another corner and one more stride. \nUnitarian Church\
  \ \n\nThe first friendly smile of the day finally greets me:\n'Welcome to Rosia\
  \ Montana!'"
