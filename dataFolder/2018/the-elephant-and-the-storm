Text: "Getting up from my desk after closing my textbook, a huge crack of thunder\
  \ strikes outside my window, putting me back in my chair. A storm has abruptly appeared\
  \ after a beautiful Spring day. As the sound of the heavy rain starts to fall, I\
  \ am reminded of a sleepless night I had during my recent travels to the Cambodian\
  \ Jungle. It was there, in the protected rainforest, I had my first experience of\
  \ a real tropical storm. The storm was fierce with lightening blinding the sky,\
  \ thunder roaring through the trees, and rain falling like a waterfall. With the\
  \ rain falling outside my window, the memories of this night start to flood back\
  \ to me. Even without a good night\u2019s sleep, I remember the excitement I had\
  \ for this adventure I was about to embark on. I was volunteering at a sanctuary\
  \ that helps rescued elephants that were in tourism. This trip was something unique\
  \ with a purpose of being there for an animal mission.\n\nThe next day as the sun\
  \ rose, before trekking through the depths of the rainforest, we ate a delicious\
  \ breakfast full of fresh local fruits including mango, and that bright pink dragon\
  \ fruit. Also served was traditional French toast.\nTackling the humidity of the\
  \ Cambodian air as we trekked into the rainforest, there was chatter about the unknown\
  \ we were about to experience. As we walked down a pathway to turn into an open\
  \ space, suddenly out of nowhere an elephant emerged. I couldn\u2019t believe my\
  \ eyes. A real-life Asian elephant. She was coming through the bushes opposite us.\
  \ Her large ears flapping and her powerful trunk swaying from left to right. I could\
  \ hear her strong body break through the tree branches as she stepped in her natural\
  \ habitat. Her rainforest. I have seen elephants in a zoo, but nothing compared\
  \ to this. Out there, there was no barrier between us, only the distance we needed\
  \ to keep from disturbing her. There was no one riding her, no basket fastened tightly\
  \ to her. She was free.\n\nWhile we admired her from a respectful distance, the\
  \ programme coordinator informed us of her life story. She was 55 years old. I found\
  \ it surprising yet comforting that animals have a story and a purpose in the world\
  \ just like all of us. It was really moving to hear she was a survivor. At that\
  \ moment something changed this trip meant more than I had anticipated. \n\nAs I\
  \ looked back out my window the storm was passing, but a reminder of a storm had\
  \ been awakened in me. It was time to spread the word of the importance of animal\
  \ conservation and awareness."
