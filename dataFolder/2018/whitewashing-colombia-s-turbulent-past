Text: "I gazed into the teenagers\u2019 eyes.  Small nuggets of coal radiating misery.\
  \ He stood lifeless behind his cart of pineapple-filled plastic cups. His beguiling\
  \ mix of African and indigenous features expertly outlined. Beyond, stenciled in\
  \ mauve, were pineapple shaped grenades.\n\n\u2018This is another piece by DJ Lu,\u2019\
  \ our graffiti guide Jay noted.  \u2018The police are cracking down on illegal street\
  \ sellers claiming that because they aren\u2019t paying tax, they can\u2019t sell.\
  \  They used to just hand out warnings.  Now they are confiscating the goods and\
  \ slapping them with a 300,000 peso fine.\u2019\n\nFor the past two hours, I\u2019\
  d been meandering through the edgy backstreets of Bogota\u2019s 300-year-old historical\
  \ centre, La Candelaria. The 2011 police killing of a 16-year-old as he spray-painted\
  \ an underpass sparked protests and the eventual decriminalization of graffiti.\
  \ Now, colorful murals adorn every building. They tell the current story of Colombia.\
  \ A narrative deluged in social-political issues caused by more than 50 years of\
  \ armed conflict. \n\nA peace agreement between the government and left-wing guerrilla\
  \ organization (FARC) had been ratified on November 30th, 2016, but the process\
  \ of stitching the country back together was only just beginning. Complex issues\
  \ - like dealing with the world\u2019s second largest amount of internally displaced\
  \ peoples, who survive solely on the informal economy of street sales - aren\u2019\
  t going to be easy to mend.\n\nJay elaborated, \u2018The pineapple grenade is DJ\
  \ Lu\u2019s most iconic symbol.\u2019 Another issue warring created. Previously\
  \ rich pineapple farmland, was now littered with improvised explosives. Almost 11,500\
  \ people have been killed or maimed, making Colombia the world\u2019s second most\
  \ affected country by landmines, behind Afghanistan.\n\nWe rounded the corner. Our\
  \ guide pointed to a white wall. \u2018The city has been painting over the graffiti.\
  \ They want a clean historical centre like Cartagena. A lot of the walls will be\
  \ erased in the next two years.  Already we have seen ten walls erased.\u2019 \n\
  \nThe sun bounced off the stucco and I couldn\u2019t help but reflect on a comment\
  \ my Bogotano roommate, Camilo, had recently made: \u2019One of the biggest challenges\
  \ for the future is figuring out how Colombians are going to deal with the past.\u2019\
  \  \n\nI stared a little longer at the blank canvas Bogota Mayor Pe\xF1alosa had\
  \ produced. As I turned to walk away, I wondered if perhaps whitewashing might be\
  \ the only way for such a traumatized country as Colombia to finally realize peace."
