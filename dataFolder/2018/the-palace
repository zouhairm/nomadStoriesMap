Text: "The creature groaned and inched its way up the mountain, fighting gravity and\
  \ age. Approaching us from behind, it slowed as if sizing up its prey. \n\nWe were\
  \ in Iraq, hiking up a mine-laden road to the bombed out remains of one of Saddam\u2019\
  s mountain-top palaces. We had been warned that the PKK, a Kurdish militant group,\
  \ roamed the area. Nervously, Jon and I turned towards the aging bus and forced\
  \ a smile. \n\nWith a shudder, the bus came to a halt at our side. The door hissed\
  \ open, spilling loud pop music into the still mountain air. I looked at Jon and\
  \ shrugged. Clambering aboard, we were met with shrieks and phones attached to outstretched\
  \ arms angling to get our picture. For a moment, I understood the allure of being\
  \ in a boy band. Greeting us on the bus were dozens of beautiful women caked in\
  \ thick makeup. \n\nI plopped down in an empty seat as the bus lurched to a start\
  \ again. \u201CWe were afraid you were PKK!\u201D, the woman seated next to me shouted\
  \ in my ear, her arm outstretched as she took a selfie of us. We had been afraid\
  \ of each other. \u201CWhere are you from?\u201D, she asked. \u201CAmerica!\u201D\
  \ I shouted over the engine and the thump of the pop music. \n\nShe looked puzzled.\
  \ \u201CAre you soldiers?\u201D\n\nNo, I said. Tourists. \u201CTourists?\u201D She\
  \ turned the word over in her mouth. \n\n\u201CWhat are you doing here?\u201D, I\
  \ asked.\u201CWe are teachers on faculty retreat. I am English teacher!\u201D, she\
  \ said excitedly.\n\nPerched at the end of the road was the rotting carcass of Saddam\u2019\
  s palace. Without so much of a glance towards it, the teachers spilled out of the\
  \ bus and motioned for us. \u201CWe need pictures with our guests!\u201D, a teacher\
  \ exclaimed. After a dozen cameras, we dispersed to explore the concrete monster.\
  \ The teachers\u2019 laughter echoed and escaped through holes made by American\
  \ missiles over a decade ago. Fading graffiti left by American soldiers covered\
  \ the pockmarked walls. \n\nWe reconvened near the bus for a picnic. Saddam could\
  \ not have chosen a more scenic spot for his palace. Snow-capped mountains rose\
  \ in the distance. Far below we could see the lazy movement of cars and fruit vendors\
  \ marching through the streets of Sarsink. \n\nOur stomachs full, our bodies warmed\
  \ by the sun, we sleepily boarded the bus. With the palace and the setting sun behind\
  \ us, the music returned. These teachers would soon return to school and begin anew\
  \ the job of teaching a new generation, backs turned towards the horrors of the\
  \ past and facing forward, eager to pick up passengers."
