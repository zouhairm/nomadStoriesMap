Text: "The sudden silence as the little girl spoke, alerted me to the possibility\
  \ something of importance was being discussed. I watched my friend freeze mid-sentence,\
  \ eyes widening and face contorting with grave seriousness as if watching a CNN\
  \ breaking news segment. Before I could ask, she began the translation.\n\n\u201C\
  I cleaned the house, I cleaned the chicken\u2019s coup, I cooked and I went shopping.\u201D\
  \n\n\u201CHuh?\u201D Came the bewilderment.\n\nI Slapped my dust covered leg in\
  \ a vain attempt to swat away a mosquito, an action which didn\u2019t allow as much\
  \ time to formulate a reply, as I hoped. Straightening up, I did nothing but stare\
  \ at my friend, feeling both speechless and ashamed. Speechless because I lacked\
  \ the words to articulate the sincerity of my sorrow and ashamed of my western privileges.\
  \ \n\nThe early afternoon sun had just graced the small city of Vasylkivka and in\
  \ a protest to make her presence fully known, came with an entourage of mosquitos,\
  \ to warmly greet the fresh blooded foreigners. Located in East of Ukraine, Vasylkivka,\
  \ with its friendly and welcoming locals, is a city filled with despair. The political\
  \ angst of Ukraine means that for most, life is a relentless struggle amidst hopelessness.\
  \ The capital, Kiev, boasting of its megamalls, is designed for the foreigners.\
  \ \n\n\u201COnly tourists can afford to shop - in Ukraine, there are no jobs.\u201D\
  \ Lamented one local.\nTales of abusive fathers are common and so too the number\
  \ of orphans. As another child began to speak, I lost my friend once more into the\
  \ realm of silence. We stood and watched the children narrate their daily morning\
  \ chores before coming to camp, which started at 8 am. This time, no translation\
  \ was needed, I could tell from the look on Varduyi\u2019s face that this little\
  \ boy\u2019s story was heartbreaking. He was about 6 years old, like the girl before.\
  \ He looked scruffy, reminiscent of a Dickensian orphan.\nThough the aim of this\
  \ activity was to bestow sweets for good behaviour, I found it nauseating. The last\
  \ thing I expected on this trip was to be confronted with what basically constituted\
  \ as child abuse. No longer the foreign camp leader who taught English in broken\
  \ Ukraine, I entered their lives, or at least their mornings. Now I understood why\
  \ little Angelica resisted all attempts of kindness offered by myself or my Ukrainian\
  \ co-leaders. Kindness was a gesture unfamiliar to her 5 year old understanding\
  \ of life. How presumptuous of me to treat them as kids, when in their day to day\
  \ lives, they were little grownups."
