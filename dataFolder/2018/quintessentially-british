Text: "The day before, I ate a mincemeat pie for elevenses and fish and chips for\
  \ dinner. What else could I check off my list that was quintessentially British?\n\
  My best friend from home told me before I left, \u201CYou've got to order a cheese\
  \ and pickle sandwich.\u201D\nI asked my new acquaintance, Sir-Richard-from-Dartmoor,\
  \ where I could find one. I always referred to him as Sir Richard in my head because\
  \ when he introduced himself in class, he told us he had once been knighted in Austria.\
  \ \nSir Richard led me through a low door and we emerged into a cramped deli. Before\
  \ us lay a variety of meats, cheeses and sandwiches in a glass case. Beyond it stood\
  \ the storekeeper who asked us what we wanted, sans the American friendly greeting\
  \ and smile.\nRichard nodded at me to go ahead. I ordered my cheese and pickle sandwich.\n\
  \u201CWhite or wheat?\u201D the storekeeper asked.\nI looked at Sir Richard but\
  \ he remained noncommittal, his head tilted to one side as he waited for me to decide.\n\
  \u201CWhite?\u201D I answered with a questioning glance at Richard. He nodded in\
  \ approval.\n\u201CDo you want rocket?\u201D\n\u201CExcuse me?\u201D I thought I\
  \ misheard him.\n\u201CRocket. Lettuce.\u201D\n\u201CAhh, yes,\u201D I said. Sir\
  \ Richard\u2019s head remained fixed. No nod.\n\u201CTomatoes?\u201D \nI could sense\
  \ my approval rating was plummeting. I shrugged my shoulders and said, \u201CSure.\u201D\
  \ Richard locked eyes with the man across the counter and lifted his eyebrows a\
  \ little. There was an almost imperceptible smile that tugged at the corner of the\
  \ storekeeper\u2019s mouth as he turned around to rotate the bangers on the cast\
  \ iron skillet. He turned back and asked what Richard wanted.\nRichard ordered.\
  \ We got our sandwiches and walked to a table outside.\n\u201CSo what was that about?\
  \ Did I say something wrong?\u201D I asked. \nRichard explained, \u201CIf you want\
  \ it like the British, you wouldn\u2019t have it with lettuce and tomatoes.\u201D\
  \nWe ate together on High Street, gazing at the limestone buildings and talking\
  \ about Corsham\u2019s history.   \nLater, after I returned home, I wrote Richard\
  \ and invited him to Oregon. I tempted him with our common interest \u2014 birds.\
  \ There were so many lovely birding destinations to share \u2014 Sauvie Island,\
  \ Malheur, Tule Lake. \nThen, I tried to tempt him with something quintessentially\
  \ Oregon \u2014 enjoying a growler from our thriving craft and microbrew industry\
  \ and drinking pints together in chilled glasses.\nSir Richard responded, \u201C\
  Since you\u2019ve taught me a new word for a receptacle (growler), I\u2019ll forgive\
  \ you for drinking ale from chilled glasses \u2026 should be room temperature.\u201D"
