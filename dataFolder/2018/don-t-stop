Text: "You see, the Mediterranean Sea pretends to be nice and then cheats, it turns\
  \ your boat upside down, it surprises you with winds of 35 knots and three meter\
  \ high waves that come down from the Adriatic. The Atlantic is different. The Atlantic\
  \ is openly tricky. It's there, telling you to the face that you have no idea what\
  \ you're going to find out there. Do not trust its winds nor its waves nor its coasts.\
  \ Be careful near land, accidents happen there.\nIt's the first thing they tell\
  \ you when you take a boat in the Canaries, the islas bonitas, where everything\
  \ is supposed to be spring, easy and friendly. They tell you to distrust the winds\
  \ when you are skirting the coast, because they are ever-changing, and it is true.\
  \ The island is volcanic, formed by enormous blocks of stone that descend abruptly\
  \ from the sky to the water, and is curdled by deep ravines between the mountains.\
  \ They are routes of wind, which gets amplified and released in the sea. The air\
  \ comes out in any direction, raging, crashing into the ocean wind, turning and\
  \ shaking the sailboats.\nIt's fun. It forces you to be alert all the time, as the\
  \ changes are radical and sudden. Even so, you rejoice when you separate from the\
  \ land and you only have to deal with the gusty oceanic wind. The fog is thick,\
  \ refreshing. The ropes are tense, the skin of your hands is made to their texture.\n\
  And suddenly you do not know where you are anymore. They have distracted you: the\
  \ intense blue, the sweet melancholy of the mist, the wind that took you by the\
  \ hand. You veered too many times, following it, thirsting for speed. You are surrounded\
  \ by fog that has swallowed the island.\nYou check your options. You can stop, facing\
  \ the wind, but who knows how long you'll spend there? The rumble of the sail flaming\
  \ is unbearable. You can sail slowly, in a straight line, trusting to get to the\
  \ island. To any of the islands, actually. If you don\u2019t, you will enter the\
  \ ocean, with its treacherous underwater currents. The possibility terrifies you.\n\
  You sing loudly, to be heard, to reassure yourself. You sing The Beatles songs,\
  \ you sing for hours until you do not know any more songs and then you start repeating\
  \ them.\nAnd suddenly a purr. A boat from the maritime guard approaching, someone\
  \ who shouts at you from it. A silhouette on the horizon: You have been sailing\
  \ towards the coast. From the boat they warn you to not get too close, so that the\
  \ waves do not hit you against the rocks.\nYou laugh, you laugh, you laugh."
