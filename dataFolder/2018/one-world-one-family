Text: It was 2015, and I just went through life changing events. My father, and I
  decided we'd go on a trip to Costa Rica together. I was living and Southern California
  at the time, while my father was in Oregon. I ended up telling my cousin in California
  and also my uncle in California about the trip. Next thing I new I had 5 family
  members going on the trip with out my dad knowing. A few days later I spoke with
  a friend in Oregon, and told him that I was going on this epic trip to Costa Rica
  with a few family members. That friend later discussed plans with some other guy
  friends. Later on I figured out 5 of my very close friends we're also going on the
  trip so we had a total of 11 people. How we ended up all making it to Costa Rica
  and planned it together in such a short time was pretty amazing. During our trip
  we ended up traveling all of Costa Rica from the west to the East. There is one
  place in the western region we met some really good friends and created it even
  the larger of the family. We ended up spending several days with new friends that
  lived in Costa Rica, and created some endless memories. It felt like a connection
  of 25 of us at least in a family on the beach.
