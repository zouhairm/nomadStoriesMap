Text: "I was in the unexplored land where invertebrate beings outnumber the life of\
  \ blue-eyed humans with fleshy beating hearts. I got the first glimpse of Iceland\
  \ from the heights. In that moment, I recalled the many pictures in thematic magazines\
  \ which indirectly had taken me there, and I could not help to feel slightly betrayed\
  \ by all of them. Opposed to the magical northern lights or dreamlike blue lagoons\
  \ I was expecting, all that was left for me to witness was a desolate and remote\
  \ brownish peninsula.   Above in the sky, Iceland resembles more to the Sahara Desert\
  \ than a country located next to the North Pole, but that is only one of its many\
  \ illusions.  \n On the fourteen-hour round trip heading to the east we explored\
  \ the island in its totality. As the bus drove away from Reykiavik, the colors of\
  \ the landscape seemed to have turned greener, although there were no trees in sight.\n\
  \ One of the reasons I had signed up for that adventure was to forget the shallowness\
  \ of the city. \u201CPeople call this place the planet Mars on Earth\u201D said\
  \ T\xFDr our driver \u201CYou will understand why later, here in Iceland we like\
  \ to take things slowly\u201D.\nI decided to trust T\xFDr and before I could notice\
  \ the dull valleys were transformed by the presence of unreachable mountains. The\
  \ bus stopped behind one of them and we contemplated incredible waterfalls, steam\
  \ vent valleys, geothermal springs, lava caves and perpetual glaciers. The expression\
  \ on my face changed eventually, along with nature.\n It was 12 pm and the sun still\
  \ dominated the sky of that summer night. I left my suitcase in a safe place and\
  \ laid down in the backyard of our guest house.\nThe first thing that struck me\
  \ was the immense purity of the air, it was so healthy and clear that sometimes\
  \ it was even hard for me to breathe it. In St\xF6\xF0varfj\xF6r\xF0ur the mountains\
  \ were velvet green. The sea was calm and shined with the last beams of the midnight\
  \ sun. The bliss of being in a place like that one was suddenly mixed with another\
  \ feeling;I felt small. I realized how meaningless my problems were and how far\
  \ away I felt from the place I  considered \"the real world\", \"the world with\
  \ things\" and I wasn\xB4t precisely hating the experience. \nI found myself smiling\
  \ at that thought until the sky went dark."
