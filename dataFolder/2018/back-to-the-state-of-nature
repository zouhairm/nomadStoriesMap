Text: "It was not the furthest place I've traveled to; and not even the hardest to\
  \ come to, though at the same time I've never gone that far. I will tell you the\
  \ trip I made to a small fishing village in Paraty, municipality of the state of\
  \ Rio de Janeiro. I will describe the scenario for you: A place with less than 500\
  \ people, no roads, no internet signal, even without a super market; no contact\
  \ with the globalized world. It was as if I had traveled to an African country 200\
  \ years ago. Unbelievable was the resemblance of that place to the setting in which\
  \ the most recent Tarzan film went. It was as if I were facing my state of nature.\
  \ Without politics, without economy, only people planting and fishing for subsistence.\
  \ It seems unusual for some, but not for me. It is indescribable the sense of freedom\
  \ one has to have to climb a cacao tree to quench hunger, it is indescribable the\
  \ sensation one has when jumping from the top of a cliff into a creek to entertain\
  \ us. I never imagined that there was such a place so close to my city. My city\
  \ with its more than ten million inhabitants. And how did I find this place? Well,\
  \ it all started with my most recent trip at the time. I had traveled to Fortaleza\
  \ with my family and my girlfriend. We stayed in a 4 star hotel with all kind of\
  \ luxury, we did the programs recommended by the tour company and we do not even\
  \ know a local inhabitant. It was a very nice trip, but the superficiality of it\
  \ made it frustrating, because we did not have the immersion that I wanted. I wanted\
  \ to make friends from there, I wanted to feel like one of them, but there was no\
  \ such contact. So I promised myself that from the next trip I would have a more\
  \ immersive experience. And that place ... It made me feel so alive. I stayed at\
  \ a friend of the college's house. She and her parents lived there, but she left\
  \ to study in Rio de Janeiro, my city. And yes, I felt one of them. Wake up at 5\
  \ am to fish in a canoe, make clay pots and wood stoves, light a fire in the backyard\
  \ (there was no electricity) and play the guitar while we drew the fish we fished\
  \ earlier, and those stars .. .Ah! The stars ... And the most interesting is the\
  \ history of the country of my friend. They were not poor or anything, in fact,\
  \ they had a successful career by what they told me. Both were lawyers, living in\
  \ S\xE3o Paulo, the largest city in Brazil. They had a big house, cars and all the\
  \ perks. They gave up everything to live in Paraty. That's it! There was no need\
  \ ... it was a choice"
