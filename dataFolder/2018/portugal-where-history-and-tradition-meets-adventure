Text: "The car broke down and I was alone in the Natural Park of S\xE3o Mamede Mountain,\
  \ Alentejo in Portugal. At sunset, all the aromas of late summer mingled in the\
  \ air: Lavender, Heather, and Chamomile - sweet smells that inebriated human senses.\
  \ I began to walk towards the Roman ruins of Ammaia, admiring the place and thinking\
  \ how a space, built by the Romans in the 1st century a.C, also revealed the amazing\
  \ influence of an empire that was present throughout Europe.\nI sat near the roman\
  \ temple, looking at the horizon. I smelled the aromatic air of northern Alentejo,\
  \ looking around. History and nature!\nIn the near landscape, on top of a steep\
  \ hill, Marvao castle, which include all middle age stone houses. No one was around.\
  \ Surely, they were already enjoying the wonderful tastes of Alentejo gastronomy.\
  \ The setting was engaging, the colours magnificent - the scenery breathe taking.\
  \ In the distance, above the castle of Marvao, the flight of the eagles, on the\
  \ horizon, the hooting of the owls and the noises of the treetops, stretches out\
  \ in the Sun last rays, preparing to welcome a beautiful starry sky that framed\
  \ a full moon.\nBefore following the path, I drink some water from an old fountain\
  \ (secular water source) which existed beside the ruins of the Roman baths. \nI\
  \ decided to sit down again, to gain the courage to walk a few miles; however, the\
  \ heat and the falling light, made me sleepily. Just a moment after I blinked and\
  \ when I opened my eyes again, I saw a beautiful woman, dressed only in a white\
  \ robe that shone in the moonlight. Beside her, a wolf, some wild rabbits and other\
  \ animals drank water at the Roman fountain, before my unbelieving eyes. I did not\
  \ dare move, not even breathe, until I heard a voice: \"Do you need help?\"\nI jumped\
  \ up, the forest ranger, reassured me: we noticed from the checkpoints that your\
  \ car had broken down, but only now I could come and get it. By your amazed air,\
  \ you saw our Ammaia, the ghost of the place, sometimes like Diana, the goddess\
  \ of hunting other Moorish enchanted, that appears to all the night visitors of\
  \ these stops, he said smiling.\nI went to the ranger's car, in silence, thanking\
  \ him for the ride. A few minutes later, already inside the castle, in Marvao, walking\
  \ through those narrow, well-lit streets, enjoying the white, immaculate houses\
  \ with plants on the windows, I felt that I had witnessed a trip to the past or\
  \ dreamed with a fantastic moment, suggested by the history of that wonderful site."
