Text: "Upon completion of my anthropological studies, I decided to travel to remote\
  \ Aboriginal communities in the Dampier Peninsula (North of Broome, Western Australia).\
  \ I worked as a volunteer in exchange for food and accommodation. I was in an outstation\
  \ inhabited by just one man and three dogs. I slept in a caravan from the Eighties,\
  \ on the top of a red cliff. Everything was as red as can be: the rocks, the ground,\
  \ the roads. The tides were majestic, revealing stunning pink rocks over the sparkling\
  \ sand. I witnessed eight different sceneries across four different communities,\
  \ thanks to the ever-changing tides. In a former catholic mission, I slept in a\
  \ container and roamed around on a Sunday morning with nobody else around. When\
  \ a wild cat crossed the basket field, I felt at the verge of two parallel universes:\
  \ the one of the new millennium, and the one that the Westerners label as prehistory.\
  \ I walked every day after my cleaning shift across one and a half kilometres of\
  \ sand dunes, careful not to step in sacred territories where the locals would perform\
  \ their rituals. I would sit on the beach and dream on. I walked at low tide along\
  \ an endless shore, with indigenous kids teaching me the secrets of the dunes and\
  \ their plants while collecting shells. Travel guides mention Broome\u2019s Cable\
  \ Beach as the place to be, where tens of four-wheel drives gather at sunset. Yet,\
  \ where I was, was beyond beauty. No city at the back, some four-wheel drives on\
  \ the dunes; eating cheese there while drinking champagne was beyond words. The\
  \ sunset was pink, blue, red and grey one night, and yellow, blue and black the\
  \ next, depending on the rocks. I stayed in an outstation where I cleaned my little\
  \ temporary dwelling from scratch, and slept with tens of lovely tropical green\
  \ frogs jumping on my door at night. In another community I minded an aquarium while\
  \ living in a huge modern house, where I was locked in for three days as required\
  \ during the funeral of an important indigenous elder. I ate fish many times, on\
  \ the barbecue, or cooked near the shore under a billion stars. Its taste was so\
  \ sublime that its name, Blueline Emperor, spoke for it. The flavour was so special\
  \ also due to the water being one of the less polluted on earth. It felt like I\
  \ had never had real fish before. While travelling solo for two months I dealt with\
  \ isolation, mosquitoes, sand-flies, and the harshness of the climate, which only\
  \ added to the sublime feeling that experiencing this in four dimensions gave me."
