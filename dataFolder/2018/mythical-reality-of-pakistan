Text: "All my things spread on bed and i am totally distracted what I have feel in\
  \ five days trip to Pakistan. Its change me on every context of life.Happiness inside\
  \ me is out breaking but at the same time I'm very sad. What I think about Pakistan\
  \ five days earlier is now become myth for me. As a Indian its give me happiness\
  \ because i look another India which was partitioned years ago.\n Lahore the capital\
  \ city of Pakistan. Narrow roads with full of crowds, noisy street shop try to sell\
  \ you their commodities , street foods attracts you.The Sheesh mahal , the Lahore\
  \ fort and wazir khan mosqe are the famous site i watched. During Badshahi mosque\
  \ visit ,I interact with a Pakistani boy who introduced him self Tauqeer Anwar.\
  \ He welcomed me in Pakistan and because he is doing a project on tourism the next\
  \ four days we spent together. After lots of talk about culture and history of Pakistan,\
  \ he promised me to show the countryside.\n Next day he took me the countryside\
  \ 52km away from main city of Lahore and i feel like i am in india. The endless\
  \ green crops made a shelter on earth. After spending two hour me and Anwar left\
  \ for Lahore. On that night i watched  a Pakistani movie in a  mall . Its 12.30\
  \ am and  i forget that i am in pakistan .out side the mall is very few peoples,\
  \ road is silent . I asked many auto drivers but no one is ready to where i stay\
  \ in hotel. I started to walk slowly towards my destination. Roads are broader in\
  \ night rather in days full of noise and crowds like old Delhi. Three young men\
  \ dancing opposite side with alcohol in hands. Suddenly one stop blaming his failure\
  \ on government. I continue my walking after few minutes a police jeep came and\
  \ stop ahead of me. They asked about my self and one of them said shaheb ji mehman\
  \ hai Bharat se (he is our guest from India). Officer asked me to seat in jeep and\
  \ I follow the instructions. When he know everything what I am doing in Pakistan\
  \ he asked me about what I think about Pakistan? For me this is new Pakistan very\
  \ new one, I told him about my experience in Pakistan and he suggested that don't\
  \ walk alone on road in mid night.Officer dropped me in my hotel.\n Same culture\
  \ ,same languages, same tradition then why we part our ways differently . Is this\
  \ people's decision or political will who divide one country into two. Pakistan\
  \ people's are very helping in nature even the relations of two countries in worse\
  \ condition. I want to visit here once again with my family and friends and I hope\
  \ one day we'll one."
