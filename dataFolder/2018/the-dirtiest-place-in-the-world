Text: "The parched Tanzanian interior is dusted with a fine ochre film. I feel the\
  \ grit in my mouth as our 5-ton truck bounces through the heat.\n \nWe lurch along\
  \ a grueling rutted road through the savannah. We\u2019re on a mission from the\
  \ dusty village of Kasulu\u2014a village friend calls \u201Cthe dirtiest place in\
  \ the world\u201D to Kigoma, on the shores of Lake Tanganyika. In the back a pregnant\
  \ woman is bleeding\u2014to death, if we don\u2019t get her to a hospital soon.\n\
  \nThe day before Jonathan, Chuck and myself had set out to rescue a group of Tanzanians\
  \ stranded between the two villages, victims of a mechanical breakdown. We left\
  \ Kigoma in an SUV for Kasulu, 100 kilometers away, to retrieve the two dozen men,\
  \ women and children. \n    \nHalfway to Kasulu we jounced into the village of Kwaga\
  \ and spied their disabled truck in the road, hood reaching forlornly for the sky.\
  \   It was surrounded by passengers needing safe haven\u2014bandits rule these roads\
  \ at night--so we packed twelve into the SUV.  There was no room for me and Chuck\
  \ and the rest so we stayed with the truck while Jonathan drove on to Kasulu, hopefully\
  \ to return before nightfall for us.\n \nWe nursed the truck to life and limped\
  \ to Kwaga's only mechanic.  In late afternoon Jonathan returned for us and the\
  \ remaining Tanzanians.  We stuffed twelve people into the SUV and headed for Kasulu.\
  \ \n   \nAnd then the most wondrous thing happened. The Africans broke into a joyous\
  \ hymn. On a day marred by mechanical breakdown, lack of food and water, numbing\
  \ heat and crying babies, they rejoice and sing. I was stunned by that one charming,\
  \ ephemeral moment. \n \nTwo hours later we reached Kasulu and as the light faded\
  \ the day\u2019s second wondrous thing occurs.  Thousands, then millions of termites\
  \ hatch. Their delicate silvery wings catch the moonlight and the ground is a shimmering\
  \ carpet that rises into the darkness\u2014an enchanting snowfall in reverse.  It\u2019\
  s a blizzard of fragile life, enchanting and captivating.\n  \nThe next day we head\
  \ back to Kigoma and stop in Kwaga to retrieve the truck when villagers rush toward\
  \ us, carrying a woman on a stretcher.  She is bleeding heavily and will surely\
  \ bleed to death.  She needs hospital care, and soon.  We take her and speed toward\
  \ the Kigoma hospital. We make it and she lives.\n\nAnd I think:  What are the odds\
  \ that on a rarely traveled road we happen through an isolated village precisely\
  \ when someone needs emergency transportation?  Infinitesimal, I say.  And that\
  \ was wondrous thing number three."
