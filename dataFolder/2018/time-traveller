Text: "He was alive with a power and potency that I recognised. An energy of restlessness,\
  \ spaciousness, consciousness. The energy that I be. Although he was denying it,\
  \ the energy surrounded his body and being with an intensity that I struggled to\
  \ resist. Who are you? What are you? Are there stories your body is wishing to tell\
  \ me? Stories from another time, another space, another dimension, another reality\
  \ maybe.\nHe was different from the others. The way he walked, the way he wore his\
  \ clothes, the way he held his head. Majestic was the word that came to my mind.\
  \ Somewhere, past or maybe in the future, he was or will be a great leader. A King\
  \ of his people, someone to show them a different way of being.\nThere was ease\
  \ in the way we communicated. When we are willing to let go of our barriers and\
  \ all the points of view that we have, what we can receive from others is truly\
  \ phenomenal. We talked, we laughed, we sat in silence, we gestured with our hands\
  \ and we used a translation app.\nThe knowledge he passed on to me of his Country\
  \ and his people was vast. Like a sponge, I soaked it up, allowing it to flow through\
  \ my body, and into my consciousness. \nAs my eyes looked over the photos of his\
  \ land and people, my body began to tremble, my cells became alive with an excitement\
  \ and a knowing. The land called to me in a way that was unexpected. I was there,\
  \ amongst the trees, the mountains, the rivers and the lakes. I was the energy of\
  \ this incredibly potent land. I saw the people, I became the people, they called\
  \ to me as if I belonged amongst them. I walked through the forests with them. They\
  \ are powerful, potent, kind and generous. Their energy, was that of the earth,\
  \ they are at one with the earth. They are leaders and they recognise that we are\
  \ all of this earth, that we are all one, from one vast continent to another and\
  \ beyond. Together we are unstoppable. I felt as if I had come home. \nI opened\
  \ my eyes. He was watching me curiously, I shook my head and smiled, thanked him\
  \ for the incredible gift he had just shared with me. I stood up, brushed my lips\
  \ across his cheek and for a few seconds I was transported back amongst his people.\
  \ I turned and walked away, aware that there were so many more possibilities available\
  \ to me now.\nWho would I unexpectedly encounter next. My body was alive with energy.\
  \ What a gift we have in the Earth and all the people on her. The contribution she\
  \ is to our lives is phenomenal. I wonder, are you willing to receive all that she\
  \ can gift to you?"
