Text: "Palms Sweaty, Arms Shaking, I looked down to my death. Cars were just dots\
  \ below me, the dewey ladder was never ending. What made me think this was a good\
  \ idea? \"Here comes the sun, nah, nah, nah, Here comes the sun. I say, it's all\
  \ right\"\n\nHours earlier, I safely lounged in the resort hot tub as I soaked in\
  \ the relaxation of vacation. Two members of the Air Force joined my Aunt and I\
  \ in the hot tub, discussing their plans to hike while they had downtime from work.\
  \ Before we were invited, the decision was made. My Aunt and I were going to hike\
  \ the Hauki Stairs.\n\n\u201CAre we really doing this?\u201D\n\n\u201CAbsolutely.\u201D\
  \n\nAt 3:00am we piled into the rental car with our new friends and nervously began\
  \ the adventure to the hike.\n\nWe crawled through the hole in the fence, made our\
  \ way through the oversized leaves, across the damp jungle floor, and excitedly\
  \ began to climb the ladder. The first 200 steps were vertical, straight into the\
  \ sky. Slowly, but surely, we emerged above the trees. \n\n\u201CCan you believe\
  \ this?!\u201D\n\n\u201CWhat a way to see the island!\u201D\n\nOur climb was noisy\
  \ as we shouted our excitement and gratitude. \n\nWe reached the first platform\
  \ shortly before dawn. To our surprise, there were 15 other young climbers awaiting\
  \ the sunrise.\n\n\u201CYou\u2019re nearly halfway there!\u201D\n\n\u201CWhat?!\u201D\
  \n\nIn silence, we watched the sunrise out of the ocean. We admired the beauty of\
  \ the morning light dancing over the island and grappled with the fact we weren\u2019\
  t even halfway through our climb. Exhausted and determined, we continued onward.\n\
  \nOnce we reached the second platform, we didn't rest as long. The climb got quieter\
  \ as our bodies felt the weight of the 4,000 stair climb. \n\nFinally, we reached\
  \ Heaven. An overwhelming sense of peace, beauty and love swept over each of us\
  \ as we soaked in those moments spent on top of the world.\n\nThen the decent began.\
  \ \n\nI hadn\u2019t anticipated the decent being more difficult than the climb.\
  \ The sunrise had dampened the entire island. Paralyzed with fear, I was certain\
  \ that with any movement, I\u2019d slip and fall to my death. Calming my fears I\
  \ sang, \u201CHere comes the sun, nah, nah, nah, Here comes the sun. I say, it's\
  \ all right\u201D\n\nBy some miracle, I slowly and carefully sang myself down the\
  \ stairs. \n\nThe moment my feet touched the soft earth, my entire body relaxed\
  \ in relief. I took a few steps back and looked up in awe. What we had just accomplished\
  \ was incomprehensible. I was certain that if I'd seen the path in the daylight,\
  \ I never would have embarked on the adventure."
