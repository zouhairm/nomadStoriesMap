Text: "In a world full of globetrotters, I decided to stick to my homeland. Exploring\
  \ my locality before I looked into other parts of this mind boggling universe. Having\
  \ a family which is always ready to go on a new adventure makes my travel seeking\
  \ soul extremely happy. This need for adventure and thrill was instilled in me as\
  \ I saw my father travel through his job, the longest we have ever stayed at one\
  \ place was nine years, travelling is his passion and he fulfilled that through\
  \ his job, I can only hope for a similar experience in my lifetime. \nFresh air,\
  \ greenery all around, snow covered mountain tops and new faces to understand, this\
  \ was the only aim for my travelling desires. Dharamshala was a town that quenched\
  \ all my dreams. Favorite foods were discovered, new clothing trends were made,\
  \ several more Facebook friends added and more over a new adventure ticked on my\
  \ bucket list. Trekking the iced steps, spotting my favorite film's famous shooting\
  \ spot - the Hanuman Temple (for all the Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani fans), slipping\
  \ and falling, it all taught me a lot and made me realize where I truly want to\
  \ be, the mountains and on the road. Be it India or around the world. The love I\
  \ have for the word \"travel\" is beyond my understanding, I still haven't figured\
  \ out why but I'm  trying to.\nTravelling for me is a medium for all my unheard\
  \ messages. The passion made me choose my profession which will (hopefully) allow\
  \ me to travel for my \"job\". Journalism is a passage of my idea of being a nomad.\
  \ I was born in a city called Kolkata, but I have never lived there; since birth\
  \ I have been a traveller, I don't have a fixed location to call home, the feeling\
  \ of travelling is my home."
