Text: "Traveling to San Francisco has been the greatest dream of mine for as long\
  \ as I can remember.\n\nI love travel and on my recent trip to the city which birthed\
  \ the LGBTI movement in a time of peace and love through characters like Harvey\
  \ Milk and simultaneously has since burgeoned to become the world center of the\
  \ technology, San Francisco. I was looking forward experiencing the home of the\
  \ growing innovation landscape around the world.\n\nI was proud to have been selected\
  \ to take part in an international exchange program to act as part of a pool of\
  \ international recruitment talent for Silicon Valley companies like Facebook, Medallia\
  \ and Google. As a young twenty something, one can only imagine the allure of the\
  \ Silicon Valley industry. Start-ups and entrepreneurial landscapes bellowing your\
  \ name. The smell of the American migrant dream wafting through the air, \"You too\
  \ can have this, you too can move to America and become the next greatest American\
  \ success story,\" it whispers seductively.\n\nOf course I left with the desire\
  \ to want to be more, do more see more. So with a 10 hour lay-over in Istanbul and\
  \ an already wondering mind. I managed to acquire a visa into the country. \n\n\
  Armed with $20 that I had saved up from a previous trip to the United States as\
  \ a memento, I took a train and hopped off at the last station which allowed me\
  \ to both be able to enter into the city as well as make it back to the airport\
  \ in time.\n\nI am a chronic to the \"missed my flight story\", however this time\
  \ I was certain that an opportunity like the one I had been presented with, was\
  \ a clear cut scenario. I had 10 hours and it was a beautiful day. I had to push\
  \ myself to the absolute limits. How can one give up a trip to Istanbul after-all?\n\
  \nThe city-scape as you travel into the Istanbul central via metro is breathtaking.\
  \ The world trade-center of Istanbul, the gorgeous architecture as you enter  the\
  \ inner city, the traffic welling up as people gear up to begin their day. Everything\
  \ about it is culturally and intellectually stimulating. \n\nThere are things in\
  \ life which are both able to captivate as well as to enthrall and a layover in\
  \ Istanbul, negotiating your budget through both the shops and side streets with\
  \ the last $10 dollars in your pocket is a sure fire way to spend a lay-over on\
  \ the trip of a lifetime. \n\nToday I have a beautiful pair of earnings and a big\
  \ bow pom-pom, both of which I love and got with the last $10 in my pocket. There\
  \ is nothing cooler."
