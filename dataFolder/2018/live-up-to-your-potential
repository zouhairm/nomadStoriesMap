Text: "It all started as I made my way from Italy to Portugal stopping through almost\
  \ every large city along the way. With a backpack full of clothes and a tent I found\
  \ myself on a bus from Coimbra traveling through the mountains to a small town called\
  \ Pis\xE3o. At first I didn't know what to expect; I volunteered to help clear out\
  \ parts of forest to protect against the nearby fires moving through the mountains.\
  \ I began with an amazing couple who provided most food for the nearby communities\
  \ from their farm. It was festival season while I was there which meant I was really\
  \ able to explore the Portuguese culture. There were about three to four festivals\
  \ a week around our little town with the main course always being sardines! Not\
  \ only did they offer an amazing venue but also really understood how to have fun\
  \ and enjoy themselves. During one of these festivals I was lucky enough to meet\
  \ an English couple whose names were John and Betti. They were unbelievably generous\
  \ and were amazing with other people considering they didn't know much Portuguese\
  \ at all. Somehow I struck a conversation with them and we clicked immediately.\
  \ As we talked they mentioned the different countries they had visited and it almost\
  \ seemed like they had traveled around half the world! Shortly after I learned that\
  \ I had actually been right.. They had started with their motor home in Europe,\
  \ crossed the ocean to North America, then down to South America, and back across\
  \ the ocean to Africa. They had so many stories it was unbelievable. Though, what\
  \ really inspired me was how they began. Before the trip they were rich and had\
  \ great jobs but just weren't suffice. They thought about it for a while but then\
  \ it came to them. They came to the consensus to sell everything, quit their jobs,\
  \ and just travel. They wanted to explore the world and all the cultures within\
  \ it. I found myself in a conversation with the couple where they told me something\
  \ I'll never forget. \"No matter what happens in your life, always keep a smile\
  \ on your face and stay happy.\" This really impacted me after traveling in Europe\
  \ for 5 months. I realized that there was just no point in being unhappy. Sure sometimes\
  \ life has it's ups and downs but there is just no point in holding a grudge against\
  \ what happens. Not only did I change after Portugal but I learned something even\
  \ greater. Sometimes it's best to stay away from the cities. To explore the true\
  \ culture of a country sometimes one must travel off the beaten trail."
