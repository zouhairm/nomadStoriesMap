Text: "Delhi is a haggler's delight and a non-haggler's nightmare. \n\nIt was the\
  \ summer of 2012 and I was there for an internship. Daily, on my way to work, I\
  \ argued with rickshaw wallahs to cut down fare from Rs.40 to Rs.20. Each exchange\
  \ was a tango between two dialects of Hindi: northern and central, theirs and mine.\
  \ \n\nOne of such times, I spotted a rick and rattled my routine enquiry, \"Bhaiyya,\
  \ DDA Flats chaloge? His response stumped me.\"Where exactly do you want to go,\
  \ my friend?\" he asked, in impeccable English and an accent indicative of formal\
  \ education! To come across an English speaking rick-driver on the streets of India\
  \ is highly unusual. Still, I feigned normalcy and fought off the urge to pry for\
  \ a backstory. He went on to ask details of my destination in Hinglish and suavely\
  \ quoted Rs.50. I tried negotiating but he was being relentless. I barked definitively,\"\
  Not a rupee more than 25\" and marched towards another auto. As I was explaining\
  \ the address, the English gentleman meddled in and dissuaded the driver from going.\
  \ This ticked me off mightily. I shot back, \"Atleast, let him go if you won't,\"\
  \ and sprinted off. I can't guess why, but he drove from behind, braked and signalled\
  \ me to hop on, declaring \"Rs.25 is fine.\" I got in, feeling vindicated! He attempted\
  \ to begin a dialogue, possibly, to cool me down. I grunted a 'Hmm' and sat in silence\
  \ for the rest of the ride.\n\nThe internship progressed and four weeks passed.\
  \ One breezy Saturday, I made my way to the heart of the city. I was strolling on\
  \ the lush and foresty Lodhi Road. \"So where do you want to go?\" I heard from\
  \ my right and turned 90 degrees to face the voice behind that abrupt query. It\
  \ turned out, a rickshaw had slowed itself and posed that question. I absentmindedly\
  \ answered,\"Lodhi garden and then India Habitat Centre\" The next instant, it dawned\
  \ on me that this was the same English auto driver from a month ago! \n\nHe continued,\
  \ \"You know how to go there?\" \n\"Yes I do..umm. Do you recognise me?\"\n\"Ahh,\
  \ yes. I had dropped you once from..\" He tried hard to recollect.\n\"Green Park\
  \ to Shahpur Jat\", I completed for him.\n\"Yes, right..so are you in Delhi for\
  \ holiday or work?\"\n\"For my internship\", I beamed. \n\"Hmm..Okay, for the Habitat\
  \ Centre, just go straight and..\"\n\"Turn right\" \n\"Yes, correct! Have a nice\
  \ day. Good luck\" And just like that, he drove off. \n\nIt was a conversation had\
  \ over two chance meetings and perhaps, meant to be continued over more. Delhi is\
  \ also, a surrealist's fantasy."
