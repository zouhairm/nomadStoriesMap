Text: "The Shinjuku streets were eager to wake to the stale morning air. The city\
  \ had its own distinct character. Buildings stacked high, people lined up inside\
  \ them, constant movement in an amazing city.  I was meeting a friend for the first\
  \ time since High School. Little did I know that meeting her again would free something\
  \ inside me that I had never known before.  I had no idea my day was about to change\
  \ me forever. I made my way to Tokyo, by train. As I walked past one of the many\
  \ shops in Tokyo station, I was drawn toward a red-bearded man. Deep blank eyes\
  \ stared back at me. I was entranced by this small figurine. It was small, not even\
  \ the size of my palm, and I began to shiver.  Unbeknownst to me, a shopgirl was\
  \ watching me roll the figurine around in my hands. Passing it from one hand to\
  \ another.\n\n\u2018sumemasen, ohayogozaimasu, \u2019 she said. \n\n\u2018watashi\
  \ wa nihon-go ga wakari masen\u2019 I replied or \u2018I can\u2019t speak Japanese\u2019\
  .  \n\n\u2018This is Daruma Doll\u2019 she said in her broken bewildered accent.\
  \ \u2018Make wish fill in eye, when wish is complete fill in the other eye\u2019\
  \n\nIntrigued, I bought the Daruma Doll. As a walked through the streets of Tokyo\
  \ to my rendezvous point, I thought about my wish. What would I wish for? I suddenly\
  \ realised that there was a reason the doll looked so soulless. It had no purpose.\
  \ No goal to work toward. I took a deep breath and filled in the left eye. A cool\
  \ breeze swirled as I let out my breath.  \n\nI headed towards The Imperial Palace\
  \ in Tokyo. The Palace is the primary residence of the emperor of Japan and the\
  \ gardens so spectacular. The gardens have Mt Fuji lookout point and boast its history\
  \ in a miniature museum, both of which has free access. I thought, given the season,\
  \ I would not get to see the famous cherry blossom tree, however, the garden had\
  \ a few trees still in bloom. Gorgeous little pink blooms dotted the branches of\
  \ the tree. But where was my friend I thought? I searched the gardens and as I searched\
  \ one beautiful landscape after another. It was like fairies had created the beautiful\
  \ display. maybe she didn't want to see me.\n\nI thought of my friend at that moment,\
  \ beautiful, tall, graceful, and a smile that could light up a room. The garden\
  \ filled with an almost magical memory of her.  \n\n\u2018Emily\u2019 my name was\
  \ called in the distance. \n\nI turned, she ran to me and put her arms around me.\
  \ Overjoyed, I couldn\u2019t believe I was seeing her again, it\u2019s like we never\
  \ grew apart. Together again, my goal was complete, I saw her happy once more."
