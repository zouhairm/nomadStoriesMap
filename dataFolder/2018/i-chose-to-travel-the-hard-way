Text: "In her thoughts are the great aspirations, to revive her birth land to its\
  \ lost glory. If travelling is what she seeks, she must find it in her roots. \n\
  \nShe knew the mindset, the ruling patriarchy, the orthodox thinking. The narrow\
  \ roads running through open ditch drains along its side, the constant stare chasing\
  \ even if you walk past them, the snide remarks if you carried a personality within\
  \ you.\n\nAway from the city of smog, she stepped down the train. She has been here\
  \ before but not with the vision she carries within herself this time. The land\
  \ of visionary Sher Shah Suri; his administrative reforms were so strong that even\
  \ Mughals followed them and remained intact till the advent of British in India.\
  \ \n\nShe has heard many women solo travellers success stories, but even they chose\
  \ a secure and safe place to travel, unlike the one she is heading for.\nIt wasn\u2019\
  t easy, but neither was the Grand Trunk Road which paved the way for travellers\
  \ from the Indian subcontinent to Central Asia in the 16th century.\n\nAll I\u2019\
  ve to do is to walk the path he built to bring forth in light the reason for its\
  \ demise.\nI tilted my camera up to frame the station name when two boys passed\
  \ past me commenting that clicking pictures would do me no good.\n\nIt was expected,\
  \ not this soon. The reality hit me. I\u2019m not in Delhi anymore. There\u2019\
  s always a tension walking down the lane or road. I remembered the last time I was\
  \ here I got into a fight with boys who commented likewise. I gave him a stern look\
  \ but not for once did he felt scared. \n\n\u201CWhat\u2019re you looking at?\u201D\
  , I asked furiously. \nThe other one steps forward calming the matter, but he didn\u2019\
  t flinch. In his eyes were the anger of how dared a girl stand up to him and said\
  \ this. They take it as a blow to their ego.\n\nRoaming here freely and independently\
  \ is not safe even in daylight. Sex Ratio is clearly evident as you step out of\
  \ your door to the main road. Either you ignore them or pick a fight every turn.\
  \ \n\nIt pains me to see how the land of the great administrator has fallen prey\
  \ to illiteracy, corruption, and casteism and met a cruel fate. Deprived of care\
  \ the tomb of Sher Shah is in complete ruins.\n\nI chose to stay here for a while\
  \ to understand the nuances of its culture, values and beliefs. Over the past month,\
  \ I stayed in my village, milked the cow, roamed the fields identifying the plants,\
  \ clicked photos and showed my work to them in order to make them understood the\
  \ work I do. After all, making a local connection is Travel!"
