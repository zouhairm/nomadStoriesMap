Text: "Willows sway in a soft breeze as the hazy sun slowly colors the lake and hills\
  \ in its golden glory. The ornaments on the nearby pavilion shine bright before\
  \ the white bridge and its intricate lion guardians slowly fade to gray. It does\
  \ not matter in this moment that the wind does not bring fresh air as my eyes are\
  \ fascinated by this mysterious sunset.\n\nEarlier today, I had decided to visit\
  \ a palace. Not any palace, but the Summer Palace in Beijing. Without further research\
  \ I decide to go there in expectation of a marvelous ancient residence. A Chinese\
  \ version of Versailles maybe, or Sanssouci, or any other palace that I had visited\
  \ on my European adventures. \n\nStanding at the gates, I am at first confused by\
  \ the size of the map on my audio guide. Then I curiously wander along a forest\
  \ path on the main route and stumble across the first sight of this so-called palace:\
  \ a canal street. Suzhou Street looks like an ancient Chinese shopping street with\
  \ a narrow pedestrian walk with small shops on either side of the canal. The voice\
  \ in my ear tells me that the emperor had this street built so that he and his family\
  \ could have a real shopping experience, with the benefit of not mingling with everyday\
  \ citizens which would not have been allowed. Next, climbing a hill with Buddhist\
  \ architecture, I earn a wonderful view of the surprisingly peaceful outskirts of\
  \ the mega city that does not feel so large in this moment. I stroll along bell\
  \ towers and colorful pavilions and temples to an even more stunning view of a large\
  \ lake. I spend the rest of the day discovering a marble pavilion designed as floating\
  \ boat and walking along the Long Corridor, a colorful structure depicting diverse\
  \ intricate Chinese paintings on every beam. After hiking around a small island\
  \ on the lake, I finally sit on a bench enjoying the sun set. \n\nAfter having lived\
  \ in China for many weeks, I was aware that my European expectations are almost\
  \ never met in this country, simply because my cultural background does not allow\
  \ my imagination to question my own judgement enough to know what to expect.  I\
  \ thought I knew what the word palace meant. Today, China has taught me once again\
  \ to question my interpretation of language and my interpretation of the world.\
  \ The last thing I expected today was to be astonished by an array of wide spread\
  \ architectural marvels and natural beauty in one of the largest cities in the world\
  \ when all I had planned for today was just to visit a palace."
