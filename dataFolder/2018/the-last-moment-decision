Text: "My mother has always forced me to attend big fat Indian weeding but I have\
  \ never attended. Last week she was cursing&shouting on me to attend this niece\
  \ marriage on 20th of February.She has taken out cloths from my wardrobe&asked me\
  \ to bag-pack.But I was just ignoring her.Until,last Sunday morning I had prepared\
  \ my mind not to attend this wedding,I wanted to attend Magnetic Maharashtra Conclave.When\
  \ they were about to leave my mind  changed within a moment I said I am coming.I\
  \ backpacked my stuff.It was first wedding I am attending at my Maternal uncle's\
  \ place which was 300km away.While traveling to Drought region of Marathwada I admired\
  \ beautiful Sunset right in front of our car coming.Moments with sunset I cherished.Sunset\
  \ followed by mouth watering SugarCane Juice,some snacks.The sweet taste of natural\
  \ sugarcane juice is the liquid sap of the sugar cane plant.It is very receptive\
  \ to added flavors such a mint or ginger. Sugarcane juice is extracted from pressed\
  \ sugarcane.After reaching to destination& attending wedding,greeting relatives,Sangeet\
  \ &Bidai(Farewell).Finally,I fulfilled my mother's wish of attending marriage in\
  \ a hope that she would never provoke me again of not attending any marriage.I asked\
  \ my cousin to book my tickets for my departure.He said tickets are not available.They\
  \ wanted me to stay&hang out with them. But,I have to come back for next day Lectures&Practical\u2019\
  s&that's where the moment came of my decision I have been taking since Sunday morning\
  \ that pushed me to the edge. A one Day trip to Earthquake region Killari a small\
  \ village which I have read only in newspaper & heard about earthquake incidents\
  \ from people.In Killari I met (my aunt's)father &brother who has survived in 1993\
  \ earthquake.They have arranged a chatani&Millet for us.These people have lost everything\
  \ in 1993 earthquake.At the age of 70 he is physically fit.Early morning he evacuate\
  \ himself to perform his farm work.I met his son who is doctor by profession,he\
  \ is simple& takes good care of farm.I explored their new home,Farm,crops,waterpond\
  \ which was ready to harvest.The farm workers burned fire from Cows Manure&burned\
  \ upside down Millet crop.It was difficult to crush Millet's from burned fire.The\
  \ warm Ranmeva filled our stomach.I clicked pictures with people, farm&nature.While\
  \ returning back I was felling ecstatic.My journey of 4 days filled with affection,\
  \ bond,care,chit-chat, discoveries,food,love, aha moments&that's where I felt A\
  \ decision that pushed me to the edge."
