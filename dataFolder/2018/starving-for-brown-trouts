Text: "We came to Zora's to eat brown trouts, the local specialty. Milo\u0161 had\
  \ been talking about it since we arrived. My two friends and I visited Milo\u0161\
  \ in his hometown in Croatia's mountainy region, just by the Bosnian border. Milo\u0161\
  's favourite trip was the one to the Una River falls, on the Bosnian side of the\
  \ border. He wanted us to taste the famous trouts.\nAfter visiting the falls, we\
  \ reached Zora's, starving for trouts. It was a small and simply arranged restaurant:\
  \ nothing was there for the sake of aesthetics, everything had a specific function.\
  \ It was August and everyone was sitting on the terrace. Zora was the cook, we soon\
  \ figured, while the stumpy waitress with short brown hair was Goga. It took her\
  \ ages to take our order. The hunger and nervousness level at the table were rising\
  \ simultaneously. When she finally asked what would we like to eat, we said unanimously,\
  \ with our stomachs thundering: \"brown trouts!\" \"Oh\", Goga said, \"we only have\
  \ two left. What do you say about \u0107evapi?\" We really had enough of the most\
  \ famous Bosnian dish those days. Our faces looked truly disappointed: have we really\
  \ waited that long for nothing?! \"We wanted the trouts so bad\", Milo\u0161 complained.\
  \ While we were digesting the bad news through our empty stomachs, Goga sighed:\
  \ \"Ok, I'll catch some for you.\" We followed her confused to a closeby pool, build\
  \ on one of the many streams in the area. On one edge of the pool, there was a cube\
  \ with small holes for water circulation. She opened it and exclaimed: \"there's\
  \ exactly six of them, just for you!\" She took a small net and a bucket and looked\
  \ at one of us: \"Come here and help me out\", she ordered. I suddenly forgot about\
  \ the hunger, that's how entertaining it all was, seeing a true city boy catching\
  \ fish with his bare hands. When all of the six trouts were finally in the bucket,\
  \ still alive and heavily jerking, Goga announced: \"Now let's clean them\". She\
  \ took out a knife and started cleaning the scales and the insides. As the stream\
  \ was taking the blood strain downwards, despite knowing that by the laws of physics\
  \ it couldn't move the other way round, I couldn't help but stare at the white linen\
  \ waiting to be washed in the same pool. After cleaning a fish, Goga made a hole\
  \ below its mouth and stick each trout to one of her fingers. When she was done,\
  \ she said, satisfied: \"Now we can take a picture\".\nThe sun was already losing\
  \ its August strength, as we were enjoying our food, enriched with the best of spices:\
  \ a background story and a completely unexpected experience."
