Text: "\u201CYou get out here\u201D, directed the Tuk Tuk driver, pointing towards\
  \ the inclined path. He had taken me as far as he could and would go no further.\
  \ The narrow streets were just waking up, a still silence disturbed only by the\
  \ \u2018swish swish\u2019 of a sweeping broom and a cow rummaging through the refuse.\
  \ Meandering through the sinuous paths, I surveyed the layers of blue paint eroding\
  \ from the walls, the brick exposed underneath. Cracked drainpipes navigated the\
  \ disintegrating walls to the gutters while wires cobwebbed overhead. Beneath a\
  \ stairwell, an assemblage of objects enveloped in the same blue paint melded into\
  \ the scene; a voluminous pot, a single shoe, an oxidized bicycle, a man\u2019s\
  \ shirt - all arranged as though in a Vermeer still life. Resisting the urge to\
  \ peer beyond the scalloped doorways I climbed higher along the path, the Mehrangarh\
  \ Fort now in sight.  The fort\u2019s immense scale loomed in stark contrast to\
  \ the blue washed Brahmin houses of Jodphur\u2019s Brahmapuri.\n\nTurning a corner,\
  \ the tempo abruptly changed when a growling dog blocked my path. Startled, I tried\
  \ to double back but a woman appeared, clutching my arm and ushering me past. Bowing\
  \ my head in thanks and catching my breath, I detected the sound of approaching\
  \ drums. \u2018Crash!\u2019 A young cymbalist extended his shining cymbals as their\
  \ vibrations hit the walls. Admiring the marching ensemble rolling past, I drew\
  \ breath as the procession behind was revealed.\n\nA kaleidoscope of the most beautifully\
  \ adorned smiling girls in wondrous combinations of fuchsia and turquoise, crimson\
  \ and amber, emerald and indigo moved towards me. Each girl balanced a silver urn\
  \ upon her raven hair, wrapped in a garland of marigolds. Embellished in silver\
  \ bangles and pompoms, lengths of bright tulle trailed from their shoulders. Enraptured\
  \ by this merry troop, I pursued the stream of sound and colour, waving to the women\
  \ who leaned from the windows overhead.\n\nThe crescendo built as we trailed the\
  \ hill and reached the school, where a teacher insisted that I join them. There\
  \ followed a privileged immersion into the Hindu celebration, Basant Panchami, for\
  \ Goddess Saraswati, deity of wisdom and learning. The celebration of nature and\
  \ vibrancy of life was apparent in the explosion of marigolds decorating the schoolyard,\
  \ where families sat around hearths, chanting mantras and offering puja. Aromatic\
  \ incense filled my nose as I scattered mangowood upon the flames. Embraced in these\
  \ rituals, I left feeling blessed with an education."
