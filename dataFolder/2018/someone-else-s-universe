Text: "I lived on a mountain. As I drove up the hills, pressure would build in my\
  \ ears. When I raced into town, I hardly noticed the surrounding brightness, but\
  \ driving home, I paid attention to the darkness.\_\n\nI was a bit homesick, a bit\
  \ lonely, and a bit tired from doing work I didn\u2019t enjoy. So I took Zulu. I\
  \ wanted to be able to buy some fruit and amagwinya from the woman at the roadside\
  \ shop. It was less of a shop than a shack, with its tin roof held down by rocks,\
  \ but that didn\u2019t stop the smell of fried dough from wafting out at me.\_\n\
  \nAmagwinya was the first traditional food I tasted \u2013 golden crunch protecting\
  \ pillowy, steaming innards, like bannock of the North American Natives or a plain\
  \ American donut. Some halve them and sandwich meats in between. I liked to tear\
  \ it with my fingers and dab morsels in cinnamon sugar. It was comforting, sort\
  \ of like home.\_\n\nEvery Monday I drove into town for class. I learnt to greet\
  \ others. \u201CSawubona\u201D Hello. \u201CKunjani?\u201D How are you? The students\
  \ delighted in teaching me small phrases in their mother tongue. \u201CSiyaphila\u201D\
  \ I am well. \u201CSiyaphila nami\u201D I am well also. \n\nI learned to navigate\
  \ my way in the fog. I met my neighbours in the dark, identities I couldn\u2019\
  t pinpoint in the light. There were no street lamps. In the mist, headlights made\
  \ the fog worse. There was no rail guarding me from the cliff\u2019s edge and I\
  \ learned to move slowly. \n\nClear skies were the best nights. From my home in\
  \ Toronto, city lights created a different kind of fog, but within the gates of\
  \ my school, I could see the Milky Way. I rarely stayed out after dark, but on Mondays\
  \ I looked at the stars. On the other side was Sweetwaters Township; every night\
  \ we slept under the same sky, but on Mondays, I kept the galaxy to myself. \n\n\
  On my last day of class, I received my beginner Zulu certificate. I mastered \u201C\
  my name is \u2013\u201D, \u201Cigama lakho\u201D, and \u201Cgood night\u201D, \u201C\
  lala kahle\u201D. In the southern hemisphere winter came in my summer months. Work\
  \ became busy and soon it was time to go home.\n\nI packed my year into a single\
  \ suitcase. A layer of dust coated my vocabulary books. I hadn\u2019t practiced\
  \ in a little while. Sitting at the crossroads of \u201Ctaking with me\u201D and\
  \ \u201Cleaving behind\u201D, I weighed the books in my hands. No one at home spoke\
  \ Zulu. I packed them anyway.  \n\nI\u2019d like to say I went to the stand. I imagined\
  \ buying amagwinya and a basket of peaches, but I didn\u2019t. Instead, I learned\
  \ to say, \u201CAmagwinya ngicela?\u201D, \u201CCould I please get amagwinya?\u201D\
  , and went home."
