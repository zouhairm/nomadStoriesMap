Text: "For as long as I can remember, Canada was at the very top of my bucket list.\
  \ My childhood was filled with pictures of Canada; the breathtaking rockies, the\
  \ outstanding lakes and the cities which had skyscrapers that reached into the skies.\
  \ It was such a beautiful place that I knew I wasn\u2019t the only one filled with\
  \ longing for it. This meant that when my friends and I were deciding on where to\
  \ go for our trip celebrating that we finally graduated from university, it was\
  \ an easy choice about where we should go. We picked a tour that started and finished\
  \ in Vancouver, taking us through national parks in British Columbia and some in\
  \ Alberta too. Camping. Glacier hikes. White water rafting. I fell in love.  \n\
  Everything moved fast after that. We arrived in London, then Vancouver. We got to\
  \ our hotel. We met our guide, then the other nine people we would be sharing our\
  \ lives with for the next eleven days. After that, we were piling into a minivan,\
  \ leaving Vancouver and heading for the hills. Now, when I say hills, I actually\
  \ mean mountains. The first unexpected part of the trip was the unbelievable beauty\
  \ of Canada. I\u2019d heard people say it all the time. I guess it\u2019s one of\
  \ those things you don\u2019t really appreciate until you see it for yourself, like\
  \ ghosts, or certain celebrities. Mountains rose around us, trees and the glorious\
  \ sunshine completed the picture. \nMany unexpected things happened on that trip;\
  \ from widespread wildfires, to unexpected bear sightings and to life-size fibreglass\
  \ dinosaurs (log barn is a magical place). Suffice to say, I had a lot of new experiences.\
  \ Except, it wasn\u2019t something that happened on the trip that was the thing\
  \ I least expected. It happened after. The last thing I expected was the ache. The\
  \ ache that Canada left in me. The ache I feel whenever a lake that we seen pops\
  \ up on my Facebook feed. The ache I feel whenever I see the Canada travel guides\
  \ at work. The ache I feel when I remember those times walking to the toilet in\
  \ the campsite when the sun would be setting; when it would be me, the trees, the\
  \ mountains, the sunset and the stars coming out above me. Just me and Canada. I\
  \ didn\u2019t expect to miss it all so much. Because I do. I really do. Just picturing\
  \ it now I feel the ache. I know I experienced a lot on my trip, I just didn\u2019\
  t expect the ache to be so deep. I didn\u2019t expect to want to go back so badly\
  \ as I do. I want to go back and see everything again. I want to see more. If I\
  \ was there now? God, I\u2019d probably never leave."
