Text: "The cultures in India are mixed together. When the British left India they\
  \ left some of their lifestyle to us. We follow them in the office and at home.\
  \ We merge those lifestyles and follow our own habits. This is a thing which you\
  \ see nowhere except in India.\n\nOne thing to be considered is that India is the\
  \ second smartest country in the world and others depend on India.\n\nSo I conclude\
  \ that India is a very incredible and mystical \u2014 yet to be discovered. Even\
  \ though it has things like corruption which we have to work towards getting rid\
  \ off, one day we will become the best and I love my India.  August 15 is a memorable\
  \ day in the history of India. It was on August 15, 1947, that India won her independence\
  \ after a long and bitter struggle. At the stroke of midnight, Jawaharlal Nehru\
  \ read out his \u201CTryst with destiny\u201D speech, proclaiming India's independence.\
  \ He became the first Prime Minister of Independent India. Today, as befitting the\
  \ day, there are celebrations all over the nation with the national flag being hoisted.\
  \ From the ramparts of the Red Fort in New Delhi, the Prime Minister delivers his\
  \ message to the nation. His speech highlights the achievements of the government\
  \ during the past year and also pays tribute to freedom fighters.\n\nI love my India\n\
  \nOn August 15 we celebrated our 64th Independence Day. Kids wrote in to say what\
  \ they loved most about India. While some said it was the varied culture and heritage,\
  \ others spoke of the beauty of the country.\n\nUnity in diversity\n\nIndia is a\
  \ land of different cultures, heritages, many languages and religions. Despite the\
  \ differences our India is united in its diversity.\n\nThe people of this country,\
  \ its beautiful cultures, its languages, the places and the good heart of the Indians\
  \ make us feel proud that we are born in such a beautiful land. Our mother India\
  \ has been teaching her children different skills and talents such as sports, archery,\
  \ defences, music, dance, art, humanity,  August 15 is a memorable day in the history\
  \ of India. It was on August 15, 1947, that India won her independence after a long\
