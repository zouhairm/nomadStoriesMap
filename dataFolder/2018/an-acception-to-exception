Text: "I was back. It had been nearly five years since my last encounter with the\
  \ panoramic mountain views. Time hadn\u2019t changed them, even if I was a completely\
  \ different person now as opposed to the first time I\u2019d laid my juvenile eyes\
  \ upon their magic. Although I had been born in the striking, yet simplistic Swiss\
  \ natures, my family and I had relocated to Canada when I was still a very young\
  \ age. Its\u2019 sights remained oddly familiar in the cloudy memories of my younger\
  \ self. It\u2019s charisma however, often held an air of taint. This particular\
  \ visit had been orchestrated by my mother, who, as defiant as she made herself\
  \ out to be to the emotional rigors of familial abuse, seemed to also find herself\
  \ tethered to it. How strange it was to allow a group of people you call family\
  \ plague the very comforts and intuitions of the very first place you ever called\
  \ home. It brought a lump to my throat, an anger in my heart. The feelings of rejection\
  \ had been so disregarded over the years that sometimes I felt like there was nothing\
  \ left to do but weep for them. \n\u201CEs isch doch wunderbar, neud?\u201D\nAn\
  \ older gentleman in a wheelchair rolled up beside me. His legs had long since atrophied\
  \ and were tied securely to the leg supports on his chair. He had a certain pallor\
  \ about him: one you became rather familiar with as a healthcare professional. \u201C\
  Yes\u201D I replied in Swiss-German, \u201CYes, it\nis rather beautiful\u201D. \n\
  We sat there together in silence, soaking up the warm rays of the sun. For all its\
  \ relaxing purposes, I sensed there was a more specific reason to his visit. It\
  \ was like he had taken the 912metre ascent to the top of Monte San Salvatore to\
  \ say goodbye to an old friend. \n\u201CYou look sad\u201D I stated. \n\u201CI am\
  \ not.. sad\u201D he replied. I didn\u2019t pry. \nAfter several minutes, he spoke\
  \ on his own accord, keeping his gaze set on the horizon in front of us. \n\"On\
  \ this day, many years ago I lost the function of my legs here, on this mountain.\
  \ Today I have been told I have Colon Cancer. The prognosis, I\u2019m afraid, is\
  \ not favorable\u201D. \nI reached over and squeezed his hand. Words held no regard\
  \ in these situations. \nHe shook his head and smiled at me. \n\"Today has been\
  \ the purest snap shot of time in the last 47 years of my life\". \nI looked into\
  \ his eyes, begging for an explanation.\nHe squeezed my hand back.\n\"My dear, if\
  \ only I'd come to find myself the way death has allowed me to today, decades ago\"\
  .\nThe words brought goosebumps to both our skins. And together, we watched the\
  \ sun go down."
