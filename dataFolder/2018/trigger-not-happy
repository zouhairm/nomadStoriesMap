Text: "From the moment I lumbered off the Skybus, weighed down by both my backpack\
  \ and three days of travel, I sensed something uncomfortable about Auckland. My\
  \ body tensed, paranoia enhanced and I pulled all my belongings, limbs included,\
  \ inwards like an imploding star. Something in the air told me to keep a watchful\
  \ eye on those around me. I have been to many cities in many countries with a bad\
  \ reputation for the theft of tourists, but never had I been so suspicious of a\
  \ place until now. I can't pinpoint what it was that I picked up on, so we will\
  \ call it intuition.\n\nWithin a week my suspicions were confirmed when I made the\
  \ risky decision to read a book in Albert Park. I had been there mere moments, sitting\
  \ in the shade of a few trees upon a slight embankment, when I heard what sounded\
  \ like the voice of a child. I felt a presence near me before a boy appeared in\
  \ front of me briefly. Assuming this was the embodiment of the voice I had heard,\
  \ I continued my reading. Several moments passed before I noticed that this boy\
  \ was now sitting closely behind me. An argument ensued between the intuitive part\
  \ of me that had been sounding off all week, and the slightly more optimistic side\
  \ of me. A compromise was met and, though I did not leave my spot, I pulled my backpack\
  \ closer to me, looping the handles around my foot. On this summery day, at around\
  \ 2.30pm, I could not expect that a boy would attempt a crime against me. However,\
  \ I did think that, if anything were to happen, it might be that he attempted to\
  \ run off with my backpack. \n\nThe I felt a gun at my back.\n\nWell, I didn't know\
  \ it was a gun at first, but the boy had stuck something sharp between my shoulder\
  \ blades and demanded my wallet. I turned to him, thinking this was perhaps a bad\
  \ joke, and asked what he thought he was doing. Standing above me, not a child but\
  \ a teen,  the demand was repeated as he clocked the gun and pointed it into my\
  \ face. It looked plastic, a BB gun at least, either way unpleasant to be shot with.\
  \ The moment was too surreal for me to deal with rationally, so I advised him of\
  \ the witnesses around us, told him I was calling the police, stood up and walked\
  \ away. \n\nI expected bad things of Auckland, but I received worse. I never expected\
  \ to be on the end of a gun, but more so than this, the last thing I ever expected\
  \ was to still be able to enjoy Auckland after such an awful experience.  The initial\
  \ suspicions left as I came to terms with what happened.\n\nFive weeks later and\
  \ I am still here."
