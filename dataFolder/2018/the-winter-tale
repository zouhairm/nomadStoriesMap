Text: "It was my first live snowfall in Simikot, headquarter of Humla district in\
  \ Nepal. I was happy to be there for my official field visit. I always wanted to\
  \ visit the remote Karnali region. The day I arrived in Simikot was clear and the\
  \ view was blissful with sunshine and the clear blue sky. In the evening, the snowfall\
  \ started and it continued for a week. The first few days I enjoyed, I played with\
  \ snow and did photography going around with my friends. But as the days passed,\
  \ the village was running out of electricity for the only source of power was the\
  \ solar and there was no sun for days. The food stocks in local markets were running\
  \ out too. Most of the food materials were supplied by airplanes from another district,\
  \ as there was no any motor road from cities to this place but only the small airport\
  \ in the middle of the village. Due to the weather conditions the flights were cancelled.\
  \ Days were getting colder. There were no power supplies, telephone networks and\
  \ even my power banks were fully discharged. It had been days that I hadn't bath\
  \ as the water was too cold. I started feeling dirty. All my field plan was halted\
  \ and I had nothing to do than sleeping  whole day and peeping out of my window,\
  \ waiting for the sun to come out and if I could charge my phone to talk back home.\
  \ I got hopeless every day. Then on the sixth day, the sky started to clear and\
  \ there was an airplane landing which I could see from my window. The very next\
  \ day I took the flight back to home. After six months, I traveled to United States\
  \ of America, during the very beginning of winter. And there came my first snowfall\
  \ in Rhode Island. It was very different. I had heater inside my room, the internet\
  \ was working, the power was never down, though it was freezing outside hot water\
  \ was still available inside and even the transportation was accessible. It was\
  \ amazing to see the clear roads and pathways right after the snow. All the pre-managed\
  \ systems, use of technologies and the facilities provided by the state for its\
  \ people. I compared the lifestyles then and now, there and here, which made me\
  \ wonder every day every moment, \u2018why not in my country?\u2019."
