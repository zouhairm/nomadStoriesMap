Text: "The bus slowed to a stop, dwarfing the size of the crowd idling in front of\
  \ the narrow passageway to the bus station even before the sun came up. We followed\
  \ a man who came out of the woodwork, but seemed to understand the situation much\
  \ more than we did, to a large van parked across the street from the station. \n\
  \nWe boarded the van and looked out the window to pass the time. The sun was rising,\
  \ projecting vivid shards of orange and a yellow haze that pierced through the forested\
  \ mountains and into the fog. \n\nSome Laotians arrived shortly after with an abundance\
  \ of cargo, which was stuffed into every crevice of the van. Despite the chaos,\
  \ everything seemed to have its place.\n\nSoon after, we were off, but not before\
  \ a quick pit stop. The van came to a halt after about 5 minutes deeper into Dien\
  \ Bien Phu and a woman carrying more cargo walked out to meet the driver. \n\nThe\
  \ driver and Laotian passengers began to load a pile of boxes and blankets into\
  \ the vehicle. One man got onto the roof of the van and began catching the items\
  \ the others threw to him, securing them tightly with plenty of bungee cords.  This\
  \ all occurred while me, two Germans, and another American watched the spectacle\
  \ happening a world away, just outside the windows of the van. \n\nHours down the\
  \ line, past the Laotian border, and down through the Annamite Range, we stopped\
  \ once again, this time for food. Legs stiff from hours of stationary twisting and\
  \ turning, we were greeted with a traditional Laotian meal of plates ranging from\
  \ a rich and fatty bacon to bok choy. Despite this display of hospitality, perhaps\
  \ the most appreciated item on the table was the bottle of local rice wine, which\
  \ flowed from the hands of the Laotians into my glass each time I took a single\
  \ sip. The driver did not partake, much to the relief of all of us. \n\nAlthough\
  \ communication was difficult, we were able to have a basic conversation. The Laotians\
  \ ranged in age from 19 to 24 and were from Vieng Kham, a village between Luang\
  \ Prabang and Vang Vieng. They were students studying in Dien Bien Phu, making the\
  \ trip home to see their families.  The contrast was striking. Four of us were in\
  \ familiar territory and four of us were as far from home as we could ever get.\
  \ \n\nBut through this contrast, there was unity. Despite the sights, sounds, and\
  \ actions that were fresh to half of us and mundane to the other half, we were able\
  \ to connect. With some food and some smiles, we were able understand each other\
  \ without words."
