Text: "I was 16 years old, it was May of 2001. The midnight sun had began on the island\
  \ of Svalbard in the article circle. I was on holiday there with my host family.\
  \ I was closing in on my eleventh month of living in Norway. It was my first experience\
  \ ever living this detached and far away from my family. The organization I signed\
  \ up with -The American Field Service, forbade students from seeing their birth\
  \ families; so by now I was so immersed that I was dreaming in Norwegian. \n\nMy\
  \ host family was a cultured and intellectual lot that thirsted for adventure. I\
  \ on the other hand was quiet and loved to observe. I had no idea that in the town\
  \ of Longyearbyen I would find my wanderlust. \n\nThe possibilities of adventure\
  \ in a place that seems so desolate are unknowingly endless. The beauty of the sun\
  \ at 2am, the mile long elevator underground in the coal mine, and a sleigh ride\
  \ led by dogs that takes you to a tent where you dine on braised whale meat and\
  \ Norwegian style boiled potatoes. \n\nMind you the thought of whale hunting now\
  \ makes me enraged and nauseous, but at that time I felt local, native, I felt the\
  \ cold snow floor under a hide tent with only the warmth of fur hides under my butt\
  \ and the heat of my host sister next to me. I felt magic in this place I would\
  \ only ever come to experience once in a lifetime. \n\nThe funny thing is that those\
  \ weren\u2019t even the best parts. The most enchanting part of this journey was\
  \ in the day long snow mobile trip we took to the Russian side of the island. A\
  \ two or so hour trip one way alone with my thoughts looking at the miles and miles\
  \ of never to be touched snow on peaks that would take anyone\u2019s breath away.\
  \ In this moment I understood the majesty of the earth on which we live. Her true\
  \ unrelenting beauty captivated my 16 year old heart and never let go. \n\nTo this\
  \ day now 33 years of age and many blessed adventures later I still look back and\
  \ feel as though I will never have that feeling again. The feeling of raw connection\
  \ to a culture that I didn\u2019t grow up in, a feeling that you can only achieve\
  \ if you give yourself to the experience."
