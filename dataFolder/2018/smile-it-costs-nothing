Text: "It had been over 40 hours since I left my home in Tampa, Florida. As I landed\
  \ in Nairobi , Kenya in the wee hours of the night, I was not expecting to be greeted\
  \ by warm friendly smiles & a hearty jambo (which means hello in Swahili, the local\
  \ language).  But the smiles were evident everywhere, from the customs officers,\
  \ to the baggage handlers, to my driver, who had been waiting for such a long time.\
  \  I traveled to Nairobi last July to volunteer with a group called Global Dental\
  \ Relief and as an aspiring dentist, this was an eye opening experience for me.\
  \ We served patients in the pediatric ward at Kikuyu hospital outside of the capital\
  \ city. The young patients would line up early in the morning, and await their turn\
  \ with patience and immense enthusiasm. Even though visiting a dentist can be a\
  \ terrifying thing, the bright smiles of these patients amazed me. In fact, every\
  \ where I went in Kenya, I was greeted with a huge smile and friendly \"jambo\"\
  !  \n\nIn the USA, African countries and their people are often portrayed as poor,\
  \ illiterate and needy. I was completely taken aback when I saw how developed this\
  \ nation was, the capital city was full of skyscrapers and yes, even traffic jams!\
  \ Everyone had a cell phone, everyone was well groomed and most striking was their\
  \ smiles. It costs nothing to greet someone with a smile, but the effect of this\
  \ smile had on someone else is contagious and they smile to the next person...and\
  \ thus, they spread happiness. This was the last thing I expected when I was preparing\
  \ to come to Kenya, in fact I was prepared for quite the opposite. I was expecting\
  \ to see sadness & misery. I was pleasantly surprised and I will always remember\
  \ all the people I met in Nairobi, especially Lillian, who had been assigned to\
  \ take care of me while I was there.  \n\nThis trip to Kenya, and my experience\
  \ at the hospital has convinced me that this is what I want to do, I want to bring\
  \ beautiful smiles to people all over the world. Combined with my love for traveling\
  \ and my future skills as a dentist, I believe I can achieve this goal."
