Text: "One hour walking and observing each window, each artwork, reading each descriptive\
  \ text, but not understanding much. The artifacts of the \"Museo del Oro\" in Bogota\
  \ did not communicate with me. If they had a mouth, they wasn\u2019t speaking. They\
  \ were dead to me. Dead like their original craftsmen. Dead as my feet, after so\
  \ long standing.\n\nI didn\u2019t use to like museums. This is always my last option\
  \ on any trip, especially when the alternatives include: Caribbean beaches or museums?\
  \ I choose beaches a thousand times. So I was bored and decided to leave.\n\nI passed\
  \ through the mute corridors, glancing quickly at the pieces, which already seemed\
  \ to me all the same. I took three steps toward the exit, and then a workpiece spoke\
  \ to me.\n\nIt had no voice of its own, but it spoke through her interpreter Miguel\
  \ - the museum guide.\n\nI looked at that object and for me it was a crumpled gold\
  \ plate with a dirty strip in the middle. But for Miguel the metal sheet said that\
  \ it was a sacred instrument, used in rituals for the gods. The gold used to represent\
  \ the Sun and also the man. The \"dirty strip\" was a slice of copper, which used\
  \ to mean the Earth and also the woman. The union of the two: man-woman, Sun-Earth,\
  \ pointed to fertility and asked nature to maintain balance. And that the next season\
  \ brought children and also food.\n\nI was paralyzed. My eyes, already drowsy, came\
  \ to life. My feet, which complained, would have to wait to be heard instead, because\
  \ now that workpiece would not stop talking.\n\nSoon, I realized they were never\
  \ speeachless. It was me that did not understand their language. When Miguel began\
  \ to translate, my ears opened. Each work of that had a voice, a history.\n\nThen,\
  \ he went from window to window, waking up all the artifacts, putting them to sing.\n\
  \nThose artworks could not resist him. Miguel, though simple, with his worn leather\
  \ sandal and cloth side pouch, was emanating energy. When he was speaking, a passion\
  \ burned in his eyes and perpetuated throughout his body, making him dance in the\
  \ music dictated by historical objects.\n\nThis was not a tour, it was not a class\
  \ too. It was a show.\n\nAn hour passed. Some applause ended that exposition which,\
  \ like the day, came to the end. I came back fascinated with the history of Colombia.\
  \ Less from the interest in the subject than from the way it was explained.\n\n\
  Admiring the city at night, I realized that everything around me speaks, but sometimes\
  \ it takes someone to translate."
