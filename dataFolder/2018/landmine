Text: "My name is Guli elduce'd, I was born in the city of love, Paris France. My\
  \ story began when I was 12, Papa asked me what do you want to become when you grow\
  \ up,  I told Papa, \"A journalist\".\n\nYou see, I was intrigued by the life of\
  \ journalists, I saw the Paris daily, and I read stories of journalist who traveled\
  \ to far away lands to gather news, I worked hard at school, I became a journalist.\
  \ \n\nIn my first day of work, I was interviewed by an interesting man, Mr Bean\
  \ Lonni, he asked me \"what department are you interested in mr Guli.?\"\nI will\
  \ never forget my answers on that day, immediately I replied \"foreign correspondence\"\
  \nMr Bean looked me in the eye for a few seconds,  I thought he was going to say\
  \ \"you are too young Guli, why  don't you consider editorial\".\nI already had\
  \ a speech prepared for that occasion. \nInstead he said \"done\" stood up and shook\
  \ my hands \"your destination will be Africa, prepare your bags.\"\n\nI was shocked,\
  \ I expected somewhere else,  but because of my love for journalism I was optimistic,\
  \ it was the best decision of my life. \n\nThe plane I boarded,  flew straight to\
  \ Nigeria in Africa,  the flight went fast, I was excited. When we landed at the\
  \ airport I begun to feel the sweltering heat,  the people at the airport were all\
  \ dressed in colourful attires, they were all going about their activities with\
  \ smiles on their faces,  it left me wonfering how anyone could be smiling under\
  \ the terrible heat,  my shirt was drenched in few minutes. \n\nMy charriot came\
  \ in a few minutes, it was a rugged 1980 Land Rover marked with the Paris daily\
  \ logo, it was the driver an Hausa man going by the name of Socia Bello who was\
  \ my chauffuer, he explained to me that the we were in the northern part of Nigeria\
  \ a state called Plateau state, it got it's name from the network of plateaus that\
  \ surounded the state.\n\nI begun to see the rolling hills, they were breathtaking\
  \ in magnificence, it was as if a big hand had thrown them into the earth, some\
  \ looked like as if a massive hand had shoved them up and out of the earth's crust,\
  \ into the swirling white clouds that romanced the tips of the rocks. \n\nI fell\
  \ in love with the Plateau eventually, the people were hospitable, the food was\
  \ not unlike the ones I ate in Paris,  the vibrant colours they dyed their atires\
  \ into, I imitated,  then the Jos wars began, I covered every of the action. \n\n\
  I had to be withdrawn away from the plateau back home, my journalistic sojourns\
  \ on the plateau won me numerous awards in Paris."
