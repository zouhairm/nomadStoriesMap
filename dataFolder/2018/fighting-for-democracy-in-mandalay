Text: "We stood at Su Taung Pyae Pagoda, on Mandalay Hill, taking in the panorama\
  \ of Mandalay, the Ayeyarwady River, and the Burmese countryside. Northwest of us\
  \ was a cement and barbed wire compound I wouldn\u2019t have seen if they hadn\u2019\
  t pointed to it. It was Mandalay Central Prison, where they told me they had been\
  \ imprisoned in 1989 and held and tortured for years.\nA week earlier, I hadn\u2019\
  t known these men. We worked with partnering NGOs and met at a training in Min Kun,\
  \ a village across the river from Mandalay. Outside of the training, we had spent\
  \ our time in Min Kun visiting the world\u2019s second largest bell, the ruins of\
  \ an unfinished 18th-century pagoda that looks like giant doors built into a cliff\
  \ rising from nowhere, and other sites.\nThe following day we would split ways,\
  \ but for now, we had a day in Mandalay, the royal capital of Burma before it fell\
  \ to the British in 1885. The brick palace remains, a huge square complex surrounded\
  \ by a wall and a moat between the city and the pagoda where we stood. Burma got\
  \ independence in 1948, followed by more than a decade of democracy. But a coup\
  \ in 1962 led to decades of military dictatorship under General Ne Win.\nIn 1988,\
  \ Ne Win announced that he would step down. People across the country took to the\
  \ streets, seizing an opportunity to speak out after years of human rights abuses.\
  \ My friends, who were studying at Mandalay University at the time, joined the demonstrations.\
  \ On 8-8-88, the military retaliated, massacring thousands around Burma. A year\
  \ later, the military began arresting politicians, monks, and students such as my\
  \ friends. Those arrested were sent to prison for years.\nOne was deaf in one ear\
  \ from a gun being shot next to his head so many times. They all showed scars left\
  \ from the unimaginable horrors they endured. Despite all they had suffered, they\
  \ had never lost sight of, or passion for, their objective: democracy. I was in\
  \ awe, but what impressed me even more was when we were sitting at a rooftop bar\
  \ later that night. They asked me, younger and with less experience than they in\
  \ 1988, what I thought of their country, their history.\nI fell in love with Mandalay\
  \ for the ubiquitous open-air tea shops serving hot, sweet tea. For the busy markets,\
  \ the palm-tree-lined roads, the colonial architecture and ancient ruins contrasting\
  \ with the modern concrete edifices and wooden shacks. But it was the people, these\
  \ eternally laughing, incredibly humble men, who made me come back."
