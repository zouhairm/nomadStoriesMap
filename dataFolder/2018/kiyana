Text: "\u201CAunty Pooja, see weh mi have fi yuh!\u201D Kiyana gleams, engulfing me\
  \ in a hug. Emerging from her fist she gifts me a bracelet, the letters P, O, O,\
  \ J, A transfixed on green, black and yellow beads. \u201CPut it on yuh han!\u201D\
  \ I slip it on to my right wrist and smile at Kiyana to return to her seat.\n\n\
  This marks the end of my first week in Kingston, Jamaica. I stand in a classroom\
  \ in scorching 100-degree weather tasked to teach forty seven-year olds to read\
  \ and write. While I am selfishly concerned about lesson planning, understanding\
  \ Patois, or surviving without air-conditioning, the children remain enthusiastic.\
  \ Not even the tattered textbooks lining the shelves, ripped notebooks in their\
  \ knapsacks, or broken pencils in their hands inhibit their determination. An afternoon\
  \ of lessons later, my pulsing temple and I are ready to go back to the Mission\
  \ Home. As I am walking out, I see Kiyana staring out the window. She hums a reggae\
  \ riddim eagerly waiting for someone to pick her up. We both knew no one was. \n\
  \n\u201CI\u2019ll walk you home.\u201D \n\nKiyana leads me down a desultory street\
  \ behind the cerulean ocean. Like an arranged marriage, the scintillating water,\
  \ sugary sand, and luscious coconut trees are forcefully wedded to streets littered\
  \ with waste, famished beggars, and ruined dreams. 20 minutes later, we enter the\
  \ one-bedroom shanty indiscriminately built from cement and concrete. On one wall\
  \ there\u2019s a cross, on the other, splintering plywood behind a portrait paying\
  \ homage to Bob Marley, and a drawing of a Rastafarian woman with dreadlocks holding\
  \ a \u201COne Love\u201D sign. \n\nBesides her mattress lays another photo- one\
  \ of Irie. \u201CShe mek mi be strong,\u201D Kiyana had previously noted when she\
  \ discussed her mother\u2019s suicide. I stare into Irie\u2019s faint hazel eyes\
  \ and her lean frame graciously colored by the sun\u2019s golden paintbrush. Despite\
  \ covering her sleeves, Irie failed to conceal the third-degree burns her ex-husband\
  \ imposed on her. However, her illuminating smile could have been mistaken for happiness.\
  \ Kiyana\u2019s violent father functioned as an agent of isolation. He gambled away\
  \ his money on drugs, had affairs, and neglected his wife\u2019s heightened cries\
  \ until she silenced them herself. In the aftermath of her mother\u2019s loss and\
  \ her father\u2019s abandonment, Kiyana survives with her grandma.\n\nI embrace\
  \ Kiyana, hoping that the bracelet on my wrist will osmotically absorb a fraction\
  \ of her strength. \u201CAre you hungry? Let\u2019s eat jerk and ackee.\u201D\n\n\
  We walk, hand in hand, in search of sweetness."
