Text: "At the beginning I just had a dream: explore the most I could of Asia in two\
  \ months\u2026 as a solo traveler?, as a young woman? but also as a Colombian passport\
  \ holder? To be honest, I did not know about all of those tags until I started planing\
  \ my itinerary and of course until I told friends and family.\n\nIn principle, I\
  \ found I needed visas for seven of the eight countries I wanted to visit while\
  \ travelers from North America, Europe or even other latin nationalities just need\
  \ it for three. That got me down cause meant on more budget and time on migratory\
  \ applications. However, this did not stop me, instead, I was full of adrenaline\
  \ just about the idea of try it.\n\nI thought it would not be difficult, but then\
  \ I was notified that my Malaysian visa had been rejected cause in place of a flight\
  \ ticket I had booked a bus. The immigration agents claimed that Colombians are\
  \ only allowed to enter the territory by air through the Kuala Lumpur airport. Although,\
  \ my surprise was grater when finally I got it but with a warning note of \u2018\
  death penalty\u2019 if trafficking or carrying illegal drugs. Of course that was\
  \ not the purpose of my trip but I have to say that the fact of having those terrifying\
  \ words in my passport cowered me to go.\n\nDespite I tried to avoid the negative\
  \ opinions, labels during the trip did not disappeared. In Thailand immigration\
  \ went on alert when they heard about a lonely Colombian girl trying to get into\
  \ their land. They finally agreed to let me in after tell my story and show my whole\
  \ itinerary. Furthermore, I was questioned at a subway station in Kuala Lumpur trying\
  \ to buy a metro ticket due I was without a friend or family member. But the icing\
  \ on the cake was me making friends with the impossibility they obviate the reference\
  \ of Pablo Escobar and drugs. Apparently they\u2019re fans of the narco-series thanks\
  \ the film industry and sadly is the only reference many countries have of us.\n\
  \nIs a fact that we do not have the same travel possibilities, support from our\
  \ government and less the admiration than other nationalities do in the world. But\
  \ that's exactly what turned my travel adventure into the bravest and most intrepid\
  \ I've ever imagined. At the end I visited as woman-solo-traveler Indonesia, Singapore,\
  \ Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, China and Japan with the satisfaction that\
  \ traveling is an universal right regardless the race, gender or nationality. Although\
  \ my priceless reward was inspiring girls to travel alone at least once in life."
