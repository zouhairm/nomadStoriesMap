Text: "My decision to go to Bolivia and travel from the Andes to the Amazon came as\
  \ a surprise to my friends and family. I had earned a reputation as one of life\u2019\
  s \u201Cstrugglers\u201D. Academic, but somewhat lacking in the common-sense department.\
  \ \nSo finding myself alone in the middle of the Bolivian rainforest with no passport,\
  \ in a pair of trousers ripped right up the backside, was actually not that unexpected.\
  \ \nWe had arrived in the sleepy jungle town of Rurrenabaque four days earlier,\
  \ gliding into the tiny airport in the late-afternoon humidity. I was excited to\
  \ be spending the last week of my three-month trip in a bona fide rainforest.\n\
  After a night in a muggy hostel dorm-room, the sound of a billion insects competing\
  \ with the world\u2019s noisiest ceiling fan, my friends and I embarked on a surreal\
  \ three-day trip along the Beni River. During the day we lolled in our motorised\
  \ canoe, spotting pink river dolphins and capybaras. We camped on the river bank\
  \ with the fireflies and the caimans.\nOn the last day, I slipped in marshland as\
  \ we went searching for anacondas, and ripped my trousers. No problem, I thought.\
  \ My main luggage was back at our hostel in the capital, La Paz, but I had a spare\
  \ pair in my backpack. \nBut in my excitement to be back in Rurrenabaque, where\
  \ I could almost smell the banana pancakes, I scrambled out of the canoe without\
  \ my backpack. By the time I realised, ten minutes later, it had gone. \nGiving\
  \ a statement at the local police station in broken Spanish with my bottom completely\
  \ exposed was a memorable experience. The police officers were amply amused. \n\
  My friends flew back to La Paz that afternoon to make their international flights\
  \ home. But of course I couldn\u2019t fly even domestically without photo ID. That\
  \ left me with one option: an epic, sweltering, 18-hour bus journey through the\
  \ jungle and up into the Andes.\nAt 7am the following morning, we finally rattled\
  \ into La Paz bus station. The city looked beautiful in the morning sunlight, humble\
  \ against the colossal mountains of the Altiplano. The journey hadn\u2019t turned\
  \ out to be so bad. My fellow pasajeros had chatted and shared their snacks with\
  \ me, the silly gringo who left her bag in a canoe. \nFive days later, the British\
  \ embassy issued my new passport, and I was finally able to go home.  \nIt didn\u2019\
  t come as a surprise for disaster to strike on my trip. But the last thing I expected\
  \ was that, actually, I could handle it. And my trip was all the richer for it."
