Text: "Spontaneous adventures are the secret recipe of eternal youth: 1 spoon of exciting\
  \ excited people, 2 cups of intriguing places + just a pinch of an adventurous spirit.\
  \ Stir, slice, heat, bake..and let\u2019s stop here. Busted, I don\u2019t know anything\
  \ about cooking, but it can\u2019t hinder telling my story. If I had some \u201C\
  The most spontaneous trips\u201D chart, the one I\u2019m about to tell you would\
  \ definitely be in the top 3. Chernihiv is a \u201Ccity of legends\u201D, which\
  \ is located in northern Ukraine.  It\u2019s only 2 hours ride from Kyiv, the city\
  \ I live in, so it\u2019s a world mystery, how could I know so little about it.\
  \ Everything began with my friend from the LA, who was working in Kyiv and exploring\
  \ Ukraine on his spare time. He told me he was going to visit Chernihiv. The next\
  \ thing I know we were already on the road, with backpacks on our backs and wide\
  \ smiles on our faces. The first thing Chernihiv surprised us with was an incredible\
  \ tasty self-made cherry \u0441ider, which luckily for us was selling in the shop\
  \ right in our hostess\u2019 building. Another surprise: our hostess was a professional\
  \ fire dancer. I believe each town should have its spirit, some special vibe, that\
  \ connects everything around. We saw Chernihiv in Fall and it was wonderful: gingerbread\
  \ alike buildings, red roofs, colorful flowers all over the neat streets. I bet\
  \ you were intrigued with the \u201Ccity of legends\u201D part? How couldn\u2019\
  t you. Chernihiv was firstly mentioned in 907 and has been an important historical\
  \ place ever science. The astonishing past of this town makes it a must-place to\
  \ visit. There are 32 objects that are included in the National Cultural Heritage:\
  \ churches, cathedrals, museums, monasteries, theaters, monuments and parks. This\
  \ is the reason why the town has the UNESCO World Heritage Site status. Don\u2019\
  t you think that history significance is the only fun you can get there. What\u2019\
  s more? Delicious Ukrainian cuisine, tasty self-brewed beer(take it from the person\
  \ who doesn\u2019t even like beer), fruit pastilles and bright postcards and all\
  \ of this at the extremely reasonable prices, even too reasonable. Of course, the\
  \ most unexpected moment of this trip was the flamethrower in action. It all happened\
  \ at the wedding, where our extraordinary hostess was doing a fire show for the\
  \ happy couple. Our trip lasted only for 2 days, but let me say, that it was one\
  \ of the most eventful weekends of my life. I can\u2019t promise you a flamethrower\
  \ on your trip here, but I definitely know that it\u2019ll be memorable!"
