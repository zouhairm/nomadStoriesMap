Text: "Flaming alleys with the massive crowd gathered all around, shouting in chaos\
  \ and hue, large barrels flaunting across the ground with blaze rising from them,\
  \ the place was completely set to fire. River Otter flew calmly beside the burning\
  \ sight and the two looked like parallel lines moving together but failing to meet.\
  \ The moon litten water droplets contrasted beautifully with the flashing neon in\
  \ the background. There was a sea of humans all around, some swaying from the windows\
  \ above, looking like human minarets. Thousands of spectators wedged me further\
  \ towards the fire and I expected an inevitable tragedy while I witnessed this tussle\
  \ among the locals to have the supremacy of a fire barrel. For a pyrophobe and claustrophobe,\
  \ Tar Barrel Festival at Saint Mary\u2019s Ottery, wasn\u2019t a thing to fervour\
  \ but to fear. This shabby little town in the South West of England comes to life\
  \ every year revelling the most spectacular bonfire night with the most courageous\
  \ people fighting off the deadliest and evilest spirits.\n\u201CYou alright?\u201D\
  \ Alexandra asked me while mimicking another typical English way of speaking, diluted\
  \ with her Greek accent. She strived to drag me away from the human volcano, however\
  \ failing miserably. Meanwhile, my imaginations waged a war against me where I fought\
  \ with the fear of fire and encapsulation. \nAlexandra finally triumphed over the\
  \ human blanket to shelter me in the nearby pub. \u201CIt is a ritual to visit a\
  \ pub tonight\u201D she mentioned offering me a glass of special cedar prepared\
  \ to enhance the festive mood. \u201CIt is made with four special herbs to keep\
  \ us warm\u201D, she justified her gesture of getting me a drink which I politely\
  \ refused crediting my cultural habits.\nSheltering in the pub, my brain was silent\
  \ in the deafening din while I gathered my memories of fear. Memories when my skin\
  \ felt the slightest of burning candle\u2019s heat and I struggle to regain my breath\
  \ when anything encapsulated me. I intervened the darkest region of my brain, this\
  \ time not to dread or panic, but to emerge as a conqueror over the feelings that\
  \ haunted me always. \nMy body shivered in the sickening cold, however, the allure\
  \ to fight my fears kept me going. With great audacity, I stepped outside to drown\
  \ myself in the ignited ocean. Alexandra looked in her disbelief as she helped a\
  \ local woman to hoist a tar filled barrel onto my shoulder.  That night, I participated\
  \ in years\u2019 old ritual of defeating the most malevolent forces, the forces\
  \ which daunted me all my life."
