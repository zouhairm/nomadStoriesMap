Text: "The moment of endless freedom - is making your way through indwelling darkness\
  \ of a late-summer night, passing the fields of wheat between two boarders. Several\
  \ miles walk doesn`t seem to be boring with poems shouted to the moon and existential\
  \ topics to discuss. We paused for a moment and placid silence let our thoughts\
  \ fly away in different directions. I let myself wonder through the story which\
  \ happened to us. A stream of consciousness flashed right before my eyes:\nNight\
  \ hitch-hike ride from Kyiv to Odessa, sea breath, salty warm water on my feet,\
  \ jam-session on the beach at night, apartment with high bohemian-like sealing,\
  \ endless talks, so few sleep, so much excitement. Morning, hitch hiking to Moldova,\
  \ boarder, long walk, generous drivers, finally Kishinev, flea market with piles\
  \ of extraordinary things, each piece with its` own story, got lost, discovery of\
  \ a nice local pub, experimental poetry night, decision to sleep on the loan under\
  \ the National Administration. Sunrise, so few sleep and so much coffee, double\
  \ espresso and excitement - the only reason I am still functioning right now, contemporary\
  \ galleries, exploration of every possible bit of the city, ride on the scooters,\
  \ town close to Ukrainian boarder, middle of nowhere, night, bright stars and a\
  \ friend by my side, I know he also looks at that endless Universe, eight mile walk\u2026\
  I believe you joined us here.\n The true beauty is in the present moment; living\
  \ every moment to the fullest is switching on all your senses and letting it thorough\
  \ you.  Looking back at this I realize that there is no last thing I would expect\
  \ to happen. Now I feel eager to discover and to get into upcoming situations that\
  \ are waiting for me somewhere up there; feel ready for the world; feel exited to\
  \ live."
