Text: "Lying on my beach towel, I allowed the sun to discover my white skin. Alone\
  \ with my thoughts, Bondi beach was stunning  that day; it was one of the hottest\
  \ days of summer. The smell of the ocean was mixed with thousands of other smells\
  \ that it was hard for me to recognize them all.  I was fascinated by the colours\
  \ in the sky, an intense pink sky that I had never seen before. Then, the moment\
  \ of lonely freedom was interrupted by the sensation that someone was looking at\
  \ me, I could feel his eyes staring at me. I didn't  know what to do or say. I met\
  \ two dark eyes. He smiled at me and was sitting close by. With a gentle voice he\
  \ asked me: \u201CAre you local?\u201D I was a kind of paralyzed.  Those two eyes\
  \ were embarrassing me, so I replied that Australia wasn\u2019t my native country,\
  \ He told that he wasn\u2019t born in Australia either,  but that he was originally\
  \ from Brazil. Meanwhile, the colors of the sky were changing again, the sunset\
  \ was close, the blue and the red of the ocean and the sky were mixing together\
  \ perfectly. I was grateful to be there, so I looked at him and asked him his name.\
  \ His name was Thiago, we were the same age and he was an Australian citizen now.\
  \ Sitting in front that fabulous sunset, he started to tell me a lot about his past.\
  \ We didn\u2019t realize that the sun was already sleeping and the lights  were\
  \ giving a different life to the the beach. His story was like the plot of a movie.\
  \ He was born in a Favela in Brazil, his family was poor and when he was a teenager\
  \ he chose the wrong path. Easy money let him follow the wrong people and from there,\
  \ he lived a life that let him lose his freedom. He told me: \u201C In life you\
  \ need to always make a choice, sometimes it's easy;  just left or right, other\
  \ times it's more complicated, but at that age what really counted for me was get\
  \ out from the poverty and live a life where I could have everything. Have easy\
  \ money to buy all I wanted, but the day that I lost my freedom, I understand that\
  \ nothing is more important to be free. I regret everything I did.\u201D At that\
  \ point Bondi become so silent and peaceful, the ocean was darker than before, just\
  \ sometimes the were some reflection of the lights that were dancing strange shadows.\
  \ The beach was so quiet. That night Thiago told me how Australia has changed his\
  \ life, how he could re-build for him  a new life. Still now, with a clear mind,\
  \ that night has been a really important step in my life, because the last thing\
  \ I could expect was to decide to Live in Australia."
