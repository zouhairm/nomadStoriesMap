Text: "When I booked a tour of Thailand I was ecstatic. The itinerary looked incredible;\
  \ from the hustle and bustle of busy Bangkok, to the serenity of the waves surrounding\
  \ Koh Pha Ngan. One thing that didn\u2019t excite me, however, was the three night\
  \ trekking in rural Thailand. It was out of my comfort zone and alien - it\u2019\
  s safe to say I was nervous. \nThe treks began with stuffing my life for three days\
  \ of the jungle into a tiny rucksack, dumping my excess baggage back at my hotel\
  \ in Chiang Mai. At the time it didn\u2019t feel like excess baggage, I was adamant\
  \ I needed every single item that made up my 13.1kg rucksack. \nWe began hiking\
  \ up what I can only describe as the steepest cliffside I have ever seen. \u201C\
  This was going to be a long three days\u201D, I thought. My saving grace was the\
  \ huge ball of energy that was our trek guide, continuously pointing out jungle\
  \ creatures and rare flora. The excitement built inside me every time he slammed\
  \ to a halt, whispering to us to be quiet whilst he hunted down an animal with his\
  \ supersonic hearing.  I dragged myself across the landscape, each step more painful\
  \ than the last, in the seering heat, and began, surprisingly, to enjoy myself.\
  \ The crunch of the woodland underneath my hiking boots and the giggles of the group\
  \ when someone slipped on a loose rock filled my ears. \nWe arrived at the first\
  \ hill-tribe hut and I was pleasantly surprised. The locals built themselves a world\
  \ out of what I would have considered scraps. Each hut being made of wood and generations\
  \ of craftsmanship. The beds were simply a sheet and a mosquito net, but I could\
  \ call it home. We would sit around of an evening, stuffing our faces with their\
  \ homemade delicacies, and laugh as a group. The hospitality of the people is something\
  \ I will cherish for a long time. They don\u2019t have much, but what they had was\
  \ ours. \nOne evening, after another long day of hiking, the family of the next\
  \ village brought out their baby to the group. He laughed and babbled away, without\
  \ a care in the world. After all, he lived in one of the most beautiful places in\
  \ the world and had his families\u2019 love all around him. I was humbled. The locals\
  \ of these villages made me realise that you don\u2019t need much to create a home.\
  \ The materialistic aspects of the western world are merely objects. The cost of\
  \ a designer coat and the worth of a hand-me-down coat are two extremely different\
  \ things. This experience has helped to clear my vision and I have the locals of\
  \ these villages to thank for that."
