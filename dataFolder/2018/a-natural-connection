Text: "As the day breaks, the crickets\u2019 chorus does too.\n\nSomebody had hit\
  \ snooze. \n\nThe next sound could have been a bear stubbing its toe in the woods,\
  \ except it was a shabby Dublin hotel. I surmised that the bare-chested man frantically\
  \ yelling used English. It wasn\u2019t easy to tell- the Irish rouge had rubbed\
  \ off on us all.\n\n\u201CWhat time is it?!\u201D Spencer, who looks more like a\
  \ lost lumberjack, was demanding of the air. He certainly can\u2019t have expected\
  \ myself, or the huddled masses that were my cousin, my sister, and our acquired\
  \ Guinness glasses to answer. \u201CI have to catch my flight!\u201D\n\nMy cousin\
  \ Mikey is our local, albeit lost soul. \u201CCalm down, man.\u201D He offers his\
  \ philosophically. \u201CWhat time\u2019s your flight?\u201D\n\n\u201CMy plane leaves\
  \ at NOON!\u201D He must know the air is hard of hearing.\n\nI hear the crickets\
  \ again. I turn to see my sister staring at her blinking phone as if reading the\
  \ constellations. She gives the time in a loud monotone, without bias to an AM or\
  \ PM.\n\n\u201C11:32\u201D\n\nSpencer throws half the bag he\u2019d been packing\
  \ up into the unhelpful air.\n\nMy sister Christa remains calm. I\u2019m proud of\
  \ her for not being the one missing her flight today home to Vienna, but I ask to\
  \ make sure.\n\nMetaphorical crickets hold the air while Spencer is losing his scavenger\
  \ hunt.\n\n\u201C9:30.\u201D Her covers pull up like a slow, dark limo window that\
  \ she will not be taking to the airport. Her voice cracks- she meant AM.\n\nShould\
  \ I mention Spencer\u2019s flight, leaving in a ripe 27 minutes, is flying to America?\
  \ I suddenly feel more worried than forging into Ellis Island- he\u2019s not going\
  \ to make it. Mikey and I come to this realization for him. We don\u2019t mention\
  \ it.\n\nI call a taxi, and Mikey mumbles an Irish proverb in own his manner of\
  \ helpfulness. Spencer\u2019s putting on socks, as if that\u2019s the most important\
  \ task at the moment. I yell a different type of Irish proverb at him. Meanwhile,\
  \ Christa is playing a jukebox of ringtones that have nothing to do with nature\
  \ and possibly everything to do with a long, lost alarm.\n\nAt 11:34 AM, Spencer\
  \ yells to the entire wind before bounding out the door: \u201CTHERE\u2019S NO TIME\
  \ FOR GOODBYES!\u201D\n\nSpencer knocks a hello on our door. Thanks to his taxi\
  \ driver he\u2019d distraughtly befriended, we had an extra night\u2019s worth of\
  \ goodbyes to new places, from recommendations of old haunts. Like a tree that doesn\u2019\
  t care whether it makes a sound in the forest, it seems the best way to make a local\
  \ connection is to simply not worry about your reserved, or international, ones\
  \ at all."
