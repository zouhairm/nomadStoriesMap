Text: "I was recommended a beach a couple of kilometres away from my hotel in Salalah.\
  \ The walk to the beach was not as easy as it normally is, this time the route required\
  \ cutting down weeds and branches to form a pathway onto a secluded and supposedly\
  \ idyllic beach. The wind picked up speed as I got closer and the salty air caught\
  \ me off guard as I approached the line of trees that separated me from \u2018paradise\u2019\
  . As I ducked through the long grass and the broken branches, I happened upon the\
  \ most beautiful sunset as I parted the leaves. The orange bled into the sky, making\
  \ it look like the ocean itself was melting to meet the sun. It was hard not to\
  \ stand in awe and look at the power of the sun setting on this beach, it seemed\
  \ as though this beach was as idyllic as I had been promised. Walking through the\
  \ white sand barefoot, breathing in the warm salty air, I was in my own slice of\
  \ heaven. I wandered along the beach in Salalah with the sun setting across the\
  \ calm ocean, and it seemed like this moment should never end. A little while of\
  \ walking along the beach, I saw what I thought were a few holes in the sand ahead.\
  \ Feeling adventurous, and entirely inquisitive, I wandered to the tree line to\
  \ find a stick, once a perfect one was found, I proceeded to discover what these\
  \ holes actually were. Up close, they were much larger and deeper than I first realised,\
  \ after a few pokes, I felt the branch being yanked out of my hand. Taken aback,\
  \ and rather confused, I decided to pull slightly harder, to see if it was caught\
  \ on anything. It was. In fact, it was caught in between a crab\u2019s claw. The\
  \ crustacean clambered out of the hole so fast that I fell backwards. It seemed\
  \ that I had stumbled upon the home of quite a few of these crabs, soon a team had\
  \ arisen out of their holes and shuffled my way. That was when I decided to run,\
  \ rather abruptly, back to the tree line and back into the wilderness, only now\
  \ spotting more of these holes as I ran. As I made my way from this \u2018idyllic\u2019\
  \ beach, I realised it was the last thing I had expected to stumble upon during\
  \ my experience in paradise, and it seemed I had been the last thing they expected\
  \ to see too. I guess I\u2019ll be sticking to the public beaches from now on, but\
  \ who knows what gems you might find on the more secluded paths."
