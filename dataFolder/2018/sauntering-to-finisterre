Text: "The paradise aisle had only an hour\u2019s drive in diameter and although the\
  \ whole south was a desert, I\u2019d landed a job amidst a shrine of sharp-cut volcanoes\
  \ where their ash turned lush green. I was attracted to living on the edge and this\
  \ was the extended border of my everything. \n\nI wandered around soaking in the\
  \ pleasant heat of my new found precious stone, slowly weaving the diary of days\
  \ into my little myths. Most thought evaporated, the beach dance was offering me\
  \ a rite of passage and I often turned to stories to see clearer. The gipsy trickster\
  \ that so wanted to suck on love on the cardboard covered bench that was her home,\
  \ the silver pierced mulatto lawyer living in a squatted nun school, a whole promenade\
  \ of sweet idols gently shaking my reality. And right on time yet another character,\
  \ though also new in town, the best guide I could wish for, Nathan.\n\nThe window\
  \ of his so called Cave opened towards the nearby refinery with its\u2019 thick\
  \ smoke subtly suggesting the black magic that was going to be happening in this\
  \ new-born hub of most fantastical nomadic folk who had become the landscape of\
  \ this city. Although on the background the mountains pointed upwards, below also\
  \ an abyss opened and with every bitter drink served it was clearer what gravity\
  \ brought us here all together. I surely wanted to touch the bottom but I could\
  \ never imagine how easy it is to slide so deep into this painful vertigo desperation\
  \ with Nothing in sight, day in, day out.\nI was struggling to keep working and\
  \ hoped to make the best of this mess before dear Sophie comes to visit. I hadn't\
  \ seen her for ages but from her beautiful emails I knew even in her polar exile\
  \ she still likes to dig for the fire underground so I was excited about introducing\
  \ her to my underdog choir, ideally on a bonfire night on our beloved black sand\
  \ beach where she could dance with my mermaid friends. Everybody cheered and toasted\
  \ \u201CSalvation holdout central!\u201D.\n\nIt turned out to be a proper carnival,\
  \ good vibes and all, but just before I left to pick her up from the bus station\
  \ I saw the Coke accompanying the Cuba Libres solidify and from all the packages\
  \ of baking soda around I could only guess which self-prescribed remedies will follow.\
  \ The last drop of tar I could swallow and as I was hugging her a tight welcome\
  \ it rippled to the sudden necessity of finally cutting this toxic local connection\
  \ off. Over her shoulder I saw a bus leaving for the mountains and until this day\
  \ I pray they will never meet."
