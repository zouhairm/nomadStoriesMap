Text: "\u201CCan you come to our Christmas party?!\u201D Jern asked.\n\n\u201CSure,\u201D\
  \ I replied, although I considered her question rhetorical. Tomorrow would be another\
  \ trip downstairs to the Chiang Mai Ram operating room \u2014 my fourth in thirteen\
  \ days \u2014 to treat a life threatening bacterial infection.  \n\nMy mind drifted,\
  \ again, to images of new friends savoring our planned holiday on the idyllic beaches\
  \ of Koh Tao and old friends celebrating with family in the US. I wasn't feeling\
  \ holiday cheer. However, I clutched any opportunity to escape room 1118, where\
  \ I spent 23 hours a day.\n\nShuffling down the wide eleventh floor hallway, I noticed\
  \ a dozen closed doors with unfamiliar names next to the room number. Why were they\
  \ here?\n\nPink heart shaped balloons hung upside down around the soft white lights\
  \ on the lobby ceiling, some deflated as if reflecting the mood of spending the\
  \ holidays in the hospital. Happy New Year banners draped the walls, while Frosty\
  \ and Santa stuck on the office windows. The air was alive with Thai chatter.\n\n\
  Jern put a Santa hat on my head and an entire cake, a rare delicacy in my boring\
  \ hospital diet of lukewarm pad thai, appeared next to me.\n\nMy lips slowly curled\
  \ up as a familiar, yet original, scene unfolded: nurses crowded the colorfully\
  \ ornamented mini Christmas trees, and gifts were handed out one by one. The sounds\
  \ of tearing wrapping paper revealed a fun surprise: Hello Kitty slippers, Starbucks\
  \ gift cards and stuffed animals. Giggles eruped to laughter and fingers shot in\
  \ each direction as the pleased recipient guessed her secret Santa.\n\nOddly, only\
  \ one other patient was in attendance, a man in a wheelchair with thin white hair\
  \ sitting a few feet from me. He also knew all the nurses.\n\nGary introduced himself\
  \ as a World War II vet from Mississippi who spent his last 40 years living in six\
  \ countries across four continents as a missionary and English teacher. His wife\
  \ of 70 years passed away three months prior. Even at 96 he was resilient, spending\
  \ his days writing his life story in poems. Our conversation flowed and his infectious\
  \ spirit shined.\n\n\u201CYou're allowed to leave, so did you consider going home\
  \ to see your kids?\u201D I asked.\n\n\u201CThis is my home. I\u2019m where I need\
  \ to be,\u201D he said. \u201CPlus, I can Facetime!\u201D\n\nThe party ended; we\
  \ went in opposite directions back to our rooms. I hoped our happy first encounter\
  \ wasn't our last. When I returned to my room, my iPhone flashed a missed call notification\
  \ from \u201CHome.\" I smiled. Home didn't feel as far away anymore."
