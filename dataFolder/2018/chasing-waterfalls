Text: "From our Oxalis lodgings in Phong Nha, we hiked our way to World Heritage Site\
  \ Phong Nha-Ke, Tu Lan Caves. Though it was a clear and sunny day the passed days\
  \ rains had softened the clay of the jungle\u2019s ground, having us trudged through\
  \ the knee-deep mud. There was no path before us when we met the line of the mountain\u2019\
  s greenery, all but the path our guide made. It was good to work off the days of\
  \ their New Years, as the way to celebrate T\u1EBFt is to \u0103n T\u1EBFt, 'eat\
  \ Tet'. Even so I was grateful the mountains looming the path's sides wasn't our\
  \ destination. We heard the water rushing before we arrived to our camp. We climbed\
  \ up the waterfall\u2019s side and had to swim to across the cave\u2019s flooded\
  \ mouth to enter. Following the guide through to the first climb, the light darkened\
  \ and bats flew above our heads. The ribbed walls were our only foot and hand holds\
  \ walking chest flat against them. Natural light found us again in an opening on\
  \ the other side, were we across the stony jungle floor once again to another cave\
  \ were we ran into eel fisherman within. Through the cave, rushing water blocked\
  \ our path, but the guide kept going. We walked across the first waterfall, then\
  \ up a chamber that had water flowing out of three tunnels. The guide's consideration\
  \ and help made the climb feel more exhilarating then dangerous. At night the group\
  \ of porters cooked for us and we all chatted and laughed. We all shared a drink\
  \ together of homemade sticky rice wine with a cheer m\u1ED9t, hai, ba, v\xF4! I\
  \ decided to stay for an extra drink and conversation with the guide, he shared\
  \ about his job, the village and the company. He told me about how Oxalis had made\
  \ a positive impact to the village and how until they came the men had no work,\
  \ the jobs only available to women. The work the men did do was dangerous, an example\
  \ he told me about was many carting cheap appliances from the boarder through the\
  \ jungle. A lot of these men became porters and guides as they could navigate through\
  \ the caves and jungle and lift heavy things. The guide himself had a true passion\
  \ for the company, he loved that it could keep him home, as before Oxalis came,\
  \ he would have had to move to seek work. \u201CThis,\u201D He told gestured to\
  \ soft thunder of the waterfall, \u201CThis is what I sleep to every night.\u201D"
