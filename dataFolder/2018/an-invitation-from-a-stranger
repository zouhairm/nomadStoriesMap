Text: "We were driving on a dirt road that should have only been passable with a Jeep.\
  \ But here I was, sitting with three others in the back seat of a small van, swerving\
  \ from one side of the road to the other in order to best avoid mattress-sized potholes,\
  \ other cars, scooters, chickens, and the occasional goat. We would have a nice\
  \ smooth run for a few minutes, and then we screeched to a halt, driving slowly\
  \ through a pothole, often scraping the bottom of the van. Alongside the road, hiding\
  \ in the lush green vegetation of south Sulawesi, stand wooden houses on stilts,\
  \ built both to provide ventilation to prevent wildlife from walking through. We\
  \ were on our way deep into the countryside to visit extended family, a Lebaran\
  \ tradition among the Muslims of Indonesia.\n\nThis adventure began out of nowhere,\
  \ simply by saying yes to someone I had met minutes before. I was in Indonesia for\
  \ a language program and was volunteering at a local cafe in Yogyakarta. A regular\
  \ came in and before I knew it she had invited me to spend the holiday break with\
  \ her family. At the time I didn\u2019t have any plans, and was determined not to\
  \ spend the break in Bali surrounded by other foreigners, so I said yes, having\
  \ no clue what to expect along the way.\n\nAs we travelled from home to home, family\
  \ to family, I experienced generosity, friendliness, and warmth from complete strangers,\
  \ with whom we only had a few words in common. I am still at the very beginning\
  \ level of Indonesian, and most of them only knew a few words of English, but we\
  \ were still able to bond and laugh together. They told me many times that I should\
  \ learn their local language, Bugis, and insisted on taking countless selfies and\
  \ pictures to prove to everyone that they had a westerner visit their remote homes.\
  \ I had my fair share of the mini cookies and kue that were nearly forced on me\
  \ upon entering every house.\n\nBetween all the meals (one day we ate five lunches,\
  \ one at every house we visited) we had throughout the trip, I managed to connect\
  \ and learn about the life of the stranger who brought me here in the first place.\
  \ Although her life is completely different from mine in so many different aspects,\
  \ we quickly became good friends. Through this random meeting, I was thrown into\
  \ another world, far away from my upbringing in Minnesota and Wyoming, and exposed\
  \ to holiday traditions that are so similar, yet so different from what I am used\
  \ to. I went from having no clue to leaving with a \u201Csampai jumpa!\u201D"
