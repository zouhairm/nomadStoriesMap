Text: "On my 41st birthday, I woke before my alarm. The sounds of other campers awake,\
  \ already making their way through the darkness, up the steep climb to the base\
  \ of Cerro Fitz Roy to watch the sunrise illuminate the infamous setting. Panicked\
  \ I slept through my alarm, I immediately started packing my gear. Tying my shoelaces,\
  \ I finally looked at my phone, 3:51 am, early an hour before my alarm was to go\
  \ off. Might as well get a head start\u2026\n\nPreparing to head solo on a one-way\
  \ ticket to Patagonia, over a month before, everyone kept asking the same question,\
  \ \u2018Is this your Eat, Pray, Love trip?\u201D Armed with my tent, sleeping bag\
  \ and other necessities, I could see the parallels, but I still felt disgust. My\
  \ mind rioted, \u201CNo, I know who I am and what I want. I just need a break.\u201D\
  \n\n2017 was marked with incredible highs and painful, ego-blowing lows. With the\
  \ advantage of no rent commitment, life offered me a rare moment to take off on\
  \ the travel adventure I had dreamed of for a decade \u2013 I couldn\u2019t buy\
  \ the ticket fast enough.\n\nLate December, I landed in Patagonia with nothing booked\
  \ and a dream of hopping on a last-minute cruise to Antarctica. The last thing I\
  \ expected was a return to my inner-child, a daily awareness of the simplest things\
  \ that bring joy, and a new perspective on what life could look like when I get\
  \ home. Goddamit, it WAS my Eat, Pray, Love trip.\n\nStarting the two-night trek\
  \ the day for my birthday, I felt the loneliest I had traveling and questioned my\
  \ quest for sunrises instead of splurging on an expensive hotel. Thoughts of the\
  \ anticlimactic end to a trekking tryst (Antarctic guide :)), tore apart my sense\
  \ of accomplishment from the weeks prior and made me long for human companionship.\n\
  \nThat birthday morning, sitting alone, warmly snuggled behind one of the few wind-protecting\
  \ boulders, sipping hot coffee, eating my annual birthday biscuit, grateful for\
  \ the extra time my alarm snafu provided, the scream of \u201Cwhat am I doing with\
  \ my life?\u201D in my mind went to battle with the \u201Cwhat ifs.\u201D\nWhether\
  \ frozen by the cold, or for the first time in years forced to sit still - alone,\
  \ without technology, or a beer (or wine) - to just be; the six-hour inner war felt\
  \ like an hour. Opportunity and optimism won.\n\nWhile I am not sure what is next,\
  \ I know travel creates space to think differently. And solo travel creates space\
  \ for new opportunity. Life is what you make of moments that speak to you and the\
  \ opportunities you notice when you are more aware... I'm ready."
