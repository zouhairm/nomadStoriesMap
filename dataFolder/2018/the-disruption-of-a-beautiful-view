Text: "A beautiful sunny day in the depths of a beautiful afternoon, as one would\
  \ expect in the midst of the draught-stricken city of Cape Town. Off to visit a\
  \ beautiful girl, a friend, a sister, an individual to aspire to.\n \nOne that I\
  \ learn enough to intellectually feed a village from. I arrive at her student residence,\
  \ we chat for a short span of time, yet, it feels as though the entire day has elapsed.\
  \ She is the kind of woman that tends to lead me into asking myself \u201CWhy were\
  \ we not born from the same mother?\u201D. The sister and friend I never had in\
  \ every sense of the word.\n\nI walk in, she smiles mildly, I greet, she greets\
  \ back. I tell her about the progression of my day and any lack thereof. She does\
  \ the same, only to alert my attention to an uncompleted assignment that requires\
  \ filming. I listen attentively and predictively offer my assistance.  From this\
  \ point onwards, we have both established that we will be taking a drive to signal\
  \ hill. This is no difficulty for us, as we are both not only residentially based\
  \ in the City of Cape Town, but also have a vehicle to embark on our journey of\
  \ aesthetic discovery.\n\n We arrived at Signal Hill for the filming. We wasted\
  \ no time and started shooting the required shots with her smartphone. I can only\
  \ begin to describe the kind beauty that came with being atop Signal Hill. The city\
  \ of Cape Town looked so big, yet so small at the same time. We both beheld as the\
  \ sun sank behind the mountains and the city lit up like a cloud of dragonflies.\
  \ As we concluded shooting, there was more time to reminisce and be lost in the\
  \ depths of meaningful conversation. \n\nOur serene moment of being lost in conversation\
  \ was lost upon on the abrupt arrival of two policemen. These men would go on to\
  \ do everything in their authoritative power to ensure that we both felt antagonized\
  \ and intimidated. A car search ensued. From that point onwards, our beautiful day\
  \ and evening had turned into something that I would have no problem comparing to\
  \ a nightmare. The blue-lights flickering continuously from the police van parked\
  \ behind us were enough to send shock waves of fear through my body. \n\nThis is\
  \ of course slightly different to how my beloved sister was calmly handling the\
  \ entire situation. \"Do you have anything illegal in your vehicle?\" exclaimed\
  \ one of the policemen with the brightness of his touch focused on my eyes, to which\
  \ I timidly responded, \"No sir I do not\". Nothing illegal was found, yet our encounter\
  \ with them was the last thing I expected."
