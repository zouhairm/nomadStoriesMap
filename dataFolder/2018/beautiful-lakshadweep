Text: "Last December, I got the opportunity to explore India\u2019s most beautiful\
  \ and serene beaches of Lakshadweeep, a Union Territory of India. Without prior\
  \ permission, main landers or foreigners are not allowed to enter these islands.\n\
  Away from the mainland these islands retained the freshness and charm in all possible\
  \ meanings.\nWe booked the package of 5 days and 4 nights, named \u201CSamudram\u201D\
  \ from the website of Society for Promotion of Nature Tourism & Sports (SPORTS),\
  \ a registered society established in 1982, for promotion of tourism in Lakshadweep.\n\
  On day 1, we boarded the voyage MV Kavaratti at 11 a.m. from Kochi jetty. Post on\
  \ board lunch the tour manager briefed the entire group of 100 odd people about\
  \ the safety measures and tour plan. Post briefing, we enjoyed the sun set in the\
  \ Arabian sea from the deck.\nOn day 2, early in the morning we reached Kavaratti\
  \ island. After breakfast travelers were transferred to the island in small boats\
  \ from the ship due to shallow water and lagoon closer to the island. It was a bright\
  \ sunny day with a temperature of 20\xB0 C. The entire day we enjoyed the beach\
  \ activities and went for glass bottom boat ride. The boat took us into the lagoon\
  \ to show the marine flora and fauna. This entire region was full of living corals.\
  \ Post lunch we went for walk in the village to enjoy the culture and habitat of\
  \ the localities.\nDay 3 was scheduled for Minicoy island. This island happened\
  \ to be the most beautiful among all the islands and had maximum agricultural production\
  \ in the UT. However, it was affected most by the recent cyclone Ockhi. The devastating\
  \ damages were pretty visible from the top of the Minicoy light house which is situated\
  \ from the southern end of this island. We enjoyed kayaking boat ride in the crystal\
  \ clear water and delighted in the white powder like sand under the winter Sun.\
  \ Here, a group of fishing community showcased their local tribal dance.\nOn Day\
  \ 4 Kadmat island was our last destination in this hop on hop off island tour package.\
  \ We were thrilled in snorkeling and scuba diving. Post lunch we gathered at local\
  \ community hall and met local craftsmen over tea and traditional snacks made by\
  \ them.\nThese three days we closely watched how these people are living in costal\
  \ region away from the mainland and totally depending upon the sea and a little\
  \ flavor of living in voyage as well.\nCollecting any living or dead sea creatures\
  \ and carry them along was strictly prohibited. So, we returned with lifetime memories\
  \ and photographs."
