Text: "It is raining. In the Sahara desert. At 2.00 am. Yes, raining in the hottest\
  \ desert on this planet. Morocco, October 2016. The weather during my 10 day trip\
  \ to this African country was predicated to be hot and dry. Yet here we were in\
  \ the dead of night, caught unawares in the midst of this unique fling between the\
  \ rain gods and the desert.\n\nIt all began with my sleepy brain ordering my eyes\
  \ to open and investigate something wet on my face. \nMy friend and fellow travelers\
  \ sharing my tent were in the same situation, wondering what was going on in the\
  \ middle of the Sahara desert.\n\nWe stepped out of our leaking traditional Berber\
  \ tents to experience this amazing romance of nature with earth. The feel of cold\
  \ breeze on our faces, pitter-patter sound of the rain falling on the sand and that\
  \ amazing smell of wet earth made us stop talking. We stood in silence enjoying\
  \ this unique experience. \n\nThis wasn't totally unexpected as we were warned a\
  \ few hours ago before.Strong winds greeted us as we reached the base camp and climbed\
  \ our camels. Trying to get used to the riding a camel, the entire group was oblivious\
  \ to the dark clouds in the sky and strong winds covering every inch of us with\
  \ sand. Thank god for the scarf our Berber guide tied around our faces.\n\nSinging\
  \ and laughing, we even ignored the burst of thunder and lightning behind us, assuming\
  \ this was far away from us and just a random thing to happen. We couldn't have\
  \ been more wrong.\n\nWhat I saw and felt was completely different than the photos\
  \ on internet which enticed me on this two night three day safari. Photos of setting\
  \ sun on brown sand dunes and tents pitched under a clear star lit sky. Instead\
  \ of this, I stood in the rains on a sand dune, woke up few hours later to a dark,\
  \ clear star studded sky and watched it change colours as the sun rose and we rode\
  \ back to civilisation. \n\nWas this an experience any one of us were expecting?\
  \ Not at all. It was unexpected, surreal and different. Etched in our memories forever.\
  \ A highlight of a holiday which began with a friends message, \"Hey, do you want\
  \ to go to Morocco?\""
