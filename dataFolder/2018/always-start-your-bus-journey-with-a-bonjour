Text: "I glanced across the Champ de Mar toward the Eiffel Tower. The morning smog\
  \ lingered. The top third pushed through the grimy hue demanding to be seen. It\
  \ was March and the air was brisk as I hurried along the narrow streets that led\
  \ me to Avenue Bosquet near the Pont de l\u2019Alma. I was to catch the #69 bus\
  \ that toured through several arrondissements arriving at the P\xE8re Lachaise cemetery.\
  \ I planned to grab a warm baguette and wander, finding the graves of Oscar Wilde\
  \ and Gertrude Stein.   \n\nThe bus arrived on time and as the doors opened, I stepped\
  \ up three steps and hesitated beside the driver. The previous day public transportation\
  \ in Paris had been free due to excessive air pollution. Pausing with my ticket,\
  \ I asked the driver if the fare was free. The driver drew back, scowled at me and\
  \ turned away. Three people had queued at the door, waiting. It began to rain.\n\
  \nNot sure how to respond, I glanced over my shoulder to see if it was me that had\
  \ caused the scowl. Nobody's eyes met mine. I shifted closer to the driver, \u201C\
  Is the bus free today? Gratuit?\u201D The bus driver threw her head back and closed\
  \ her eyes letting out a dramatic, \u201DNon, non, non.\u201D She glared at me and\
  \ began to speak in rapid, angry French. I swallowed hard and felt a flop sweat\
  \ set in. Despite an introductory French class taken back home, there wasn\u2019\
  t a chance in hell that I understood what the driver was saying. It seemed inappropriate\
  \ to pull out my iPhone and have her speak into Google Translate. In desperation,\
  \ I looked behind me again and met the empathetic eyes of a man in a grey overcoat\
  \ behind me. I raised my shoulders questioningly.\n\nHe shrugged and seemed bored.\
  \ \u201CThe driver, she is mad at you. You did not greet her before you asked your\
  \ question. She is\u2026offended,\u201D he said. Though I was fascinated that the\
  \ she was so sensitive, I was mortified that I had deeply offended her, \u201CJe\
  \ suis desole \u2013 I am sorry!\u201D I said. I tried to back track. \u201CBonjour,\
  \ how are you?\u201D\n\nThe driver sniffed and said, \u201CI am fine. Oui, today\
  \ the bus is free.\u201D She waved me into the bus. I shoved my bus ticket back\
  \ into my pocket and hurried to a seat at the back of the bus, I hunched down and\
  \ stared out the rain splattered window. I was sure the entire bus had their eyes\
  \ glued on me in disgust. I peeked around. Only a small dog tucked in a woman\u2019\
  s shoulder bag, looked my way. \u201CBonjour,\u201D I said in a soft voice. The\
  \ woman shifted and the dog disappeared into the bag. Even the dog didn\u2019t want\
  \ to communicate with me."
