Text: "A faded postcard of a missed airbnb and sleeping at the station alone, bag\
  \ knotted close to waist, I am the picture of lost and brown at the edge of the\
  \ wall. \n\n\ni. I fear no walls, I tell myself. This robust town has its heart\
  \ in place, secret within chocolate museums and willful fantasies of artisanal chocolatiers.\
  \ On the grey streets, no cold cold enough: the first bite saves the world.\n\n\
  ii. Time chopped in precise segments by kitchen knives, an exercise in regularity,\
  \ every sweep counts in fingers unhurt. Certainty is worth obsessing over. Like\
  \ the fixity of the house I remember without the linearity of events that has unfolded.\
  \ Feet leading to timber frames, I forget to die. You can smell the sea here in\
  \ Jorvik, I feel less afraid of the water already.\n\niii. Scaling the drama of\
  \ weathered, unbent rocks at Brimham in circles (this, after following the blue\
  \ guidebook to the tee),  little doubt remains. Strange are the tides that touched\
  \ these stones, stranger still the winds.  My eyes feel the most foreign. An example\
  \ of space as a limited resource, a precedent in living cheek-by-jowl, only possible\
  \ in the white world with bodies never loaded in cargoes with abandon. Richer decadence\
  \ to follow, I must ready myself.\n\niv. Three and a half chocolate brownies that\
  \ veritably remind of putty, a mug of the best hot chocolate and tens of chocolate\
  \ tasted, I am Gluttony Gloop in my mind. I arm myself with chocolates white and\
  \ dark, dotted with peaches, berries and the choicest of citruses as insufficient\
  \ reparation. The picture of happy specificities, the finality of sweet aftertaste\
  \ jousting for space with guilt.\n\n \n\nLike nighttime ablutions I deliberate on\
  \ my imminent escape, an empty coach sprints into the passing station. Stations\
  \ are the least stationary of places, commotion only adds to the notion of affect\
  \ such names bring. I must catch a wink before the earliest train. I meet myself\
  \ with the wheels rolling in at five."
