Text: "Lincoln, Montana is known for being surrounded by fabulous huckleberry picking.\
  \ If you can find a good huckleberry patch it becomes a well guarded secret.\n\n\
  Wanting to participate in this well loved Montana tradition my family and I mapped\
  \ out a spot and decided to see if we could find some sweet huckleberries. There\
  \ are two different routes to get to Lincoln so we thought this would be the perfect\
  \ opportunity to use our new GPS device. On our device you have the choice between\
  \ fastest route or shortest route, and we decided to choose the shortest route.\n\
  \nWe were quite surprised when about halfway into our trip, we found ourselves on\
  \ a dirt road. Being in an adventurous mood, we knew that a dirt road would guarantee\
  \ a good time and it did not disappoint. We found a creek and dropped in a fishing\
  \ line hoping to catch a tasty mountain trout. But, no luck. Back on the road, we\
  \ were winding across mountainsides and even crossed a wide stream when we came\
  \ upon an ominous mud puddle. There was no going back at this point so we had to\
  \ cross that puddle. We checked the depth and with much trepidation decided to go\
  \ as fast as we could through it. The kids and I got out and watched as my husband\
  \ backed up and made his run. Brown water arced up twice as high as the car and\
  \ with the built up speed he was able to power through the thick mud in the bottom.\
  \ We made it.\n\nWe were putting all of our faith in our GPS to get us to our destination.\
  \ This trip was taking us longer than expected, especially for the so called \u201C\
  shortest route\u201D so we needed to stop for lunch.\n\nWe picked a wide spot in\
  \ the road with some promising stumps to use as chairs and we ate our lunch. As\
  \ we sat there eating our sandwiches surrounded by tall Lodge Pole pine trees and\
  \ talking about how deep that last mud puddle was, I suddenly realized that we were\
  \ sitting in a very handsome patch of purple huckleberries. We had been so focused\
  \ on our plan that we nearly missed this patch of berries. We spent the rest of\
  \ the afternoon picking so many ripe huckleberries that we never made it to our\
  \ mapped out territory. We came home with plenty of huckleberries, purple fingers,\
  \ and our own garden spot on the map.\n\nWhen we got home, we checked with the GPS\
  \ to see how many miles we were saving by this route and it was only five miles\
  \ shorter but over an hour longer to the destination. We have taken only a few special\
  \ relatives to our secret huckleberry garden to share in our unexpected experience."
