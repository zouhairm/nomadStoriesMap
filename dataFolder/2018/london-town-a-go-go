Text: "Growing up in Manhattan in 1980's, gives any New Yorker bragging rights. You're\
  \ thinking to yourself, \n\"I've seen it all.\"  \n\nThen you leave your larger\
  \ than life, little island and travel abroad.\n\nNext Stop London, England.\nAfter\
  \ a near 7 hour flight,\nmy boeing 747 landed at Gatewick airport.   When I walked\
  \ off the plane I half expected to hear a band playing God Save the Queen. perhaps\
  \ a few Brits sipping tea while waiting for their flight.   turns out it was like\
  \ any other app for what I'd ever been at. \n\n Channeling my inner Steve Martin,\
  \ circa, Planes Trains and Automobiles I embarked on a rail line to Victoria Station.\
  \ The anticipation and excitement was nearing aniexity.\nJet lag, coupled with a\
  \ five hour time difference, was beginning to take a toll.\n\nDecidedly a proper\
  \ drink was in order.\nUpon exciting the train, I made my way without haste. Taking\
  \ in the architectural design, of ancient history and keep an eye out for Pub. As\
  \ luck would have it, pubs in England are like Starbucks in New York City, one every\
  \ other corner.  I had arrived at the King's crown, with my teal Samsonite in tow.\
  \ I ordered a pint of Stella Atois from the bartender. \"That'll be 5 quid then.\"\
  \ he said as he placed the foamy beer in front of me. Took a sip, motioned the bartender\
  \ over and told him, \"I think your tap is broken man, this beer is warm.\" He smiled\
  \ and laughed. \"All you American blokes say the same thing.\"I was still trying\
  \ to wrap my head around what was a quid and bloke?  Questioning why the hell the\
  \ English drank thrir beer room temperate.  Clearly they we're unaware that ice\
  \ cold beer is the nectar of the Gods. Just then an entire Rugby team packed the\
  \ bar. It felt allot like afternoon rush hour on the 4,5 back home.  Next thing\
  \ you know chanting and song had broken out. Men wearing bright orange jerseys,\
  \ with white shorts, we're all raising their pints high in the air.  One man, turned\
  \ to me and offered a solid and brute cheers.  He introduced himself to me. When\
  \ I told him I was American, he smiled and said, I knew it straight away.\"  \"\
  How?\" I replied. \"Easy, you're packing a pistol, like John Wayne.\" My \"pistol\"\
  \ was just my cell phone and wallet. I laughed. We ended up going to 5 more pubs.\
  \ I hadn't even checked into my hotel.\nNever could I have imagined, that my first\
  \ time drinking in England, I'd make friends with an entire rugby team.  I thanked\
  \ the team for showing me such hospitality. The Brits we're alright after all. What\
  \ a great 1st impression."
