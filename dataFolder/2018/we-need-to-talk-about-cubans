Text: "If you think Cuba is about cigars, salsa and crystalline waters, well, you\u2019\
  d be right. But if you believe that\xB4s all, you\u2019d be forgetting the most\
  \ special thing: the people.\n\nLa Havana is an organised chaos. The city is colourful\
  \ and vibrant. The petrol smell, her perfume. Holes in the pavement, bands of music,\
  \ 50\u2019s cars passing by and 30 degrees in the shade. Urban paradise.\n \nWith\
  \ language no barrier -as I\u2019m native Spanish- I had pictured myself countless\
  \ times hanging out with locals, listening to their stories. I got tired of reading\
  \ how welcoming Cubans are. And I couldn\u2019t wait.   \n\nBut our first day in\
  \ the city wasn\u2019t anything as expected. \n\nIn a few hours we got people begging\
  \ to buy them necessities and once at the counter, charging us for things we didn\u2019\
  t ask for. \u201CBest restaurants\u201D recommendations led by commission. \u201C\
  New friends\u201D showing us around, and next thing, you find yourself in their\
  \ house buying fake cigars. \n\nI was confused. Deceived even. For sure I was aware\
  \ of the existence of Jineteros. I did my research. But where was the warmth of\
  \ Cuban people they had talked about in the blogs? Had my enthusiasm blinded me?\
  \ But especially, had they been telling the truth?\n\nThe sun was going down. Our\
  \ faces were burnt and our clothes shouted, \u201CI could use a shower\u201D. Grabbing\
  \ a couple of beers and head to the Malecon was the only thing we wanted. Nobody\
  \ could take that from us. \n\nOf course, we weren\u2019t the only ones at this\
  \ 8km long stone wall waiting for the sun to set. Among all the people sat along,\
  \ a family of four started talking to us. Here we go again.  \n\nWe finished our\
  \ drinks in silence, avoiding eye contact, when I saw with the corner of my eye\
  \ how the only woman of this family opened their bottle of rum, poured some in the\
  \ lid and offered it to us. \n\nI was shocked. It was the first time in the day\
  \ that someone didn\u2019t ask for something in return. \n\nStill reluctant, I had\
  \ a shot of the Havana Club and felt my throat in flames. No ice, no coke. Just\
  \ pure alcohol falling straight to my stomach. As I was shrinking my face by the\
  \ disgust, I heard them laughing. \u201CMijita take it easy, have some water\u201D\
  .  \n\nBy the third shot it was completely dark and there we were, answering questions\
  \ to these strangers. They were eager to know, and we were keen to talk. \n\nAll\
  \ of a sudden, the same woman that offered us a drink one hour ago, took a deep\
  \ breath, looked directly into my eyes and asked the last question I was expecting\
  \ to respond to. \u201CSo, tell us, how is it to be free?"
