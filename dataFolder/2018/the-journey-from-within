Text: The story revolves around my trip to Tosh that changed my life forever.Tosh,a
  silent paradise in the upper reaches of Kasol (Uttarakhand).They told me about the
  plan of leaving for Kasol in the early morning as they were booking the cabs right
  away.I was convinced to let go of my fears of the outside world and live in the
  moment.I am so happy I decided to say "YES".The Fun started in the car with singing
  and beholding each other in rush of excitement and the fears and problems of our
  lives went out with the  exhaust of the car.I was talking to my friend as the light
  reflected from the side mirror made my eyes to turn towards the front window and
  there they were.The beautiful mountains stood tall in front of me with sun's glowing
  rays sparkling by the snow covered pitches of them.The moment was felt by my heart
  which emitted a voice deep inside my soul "WOW".The sun had set behind the ever
  lasting mountains on our both sides and the heater was started to supress the cold
  winds from the river passing by the road as saying "WELCOME". The sweet chirping
  of birds outside woke me up as the sun rays found their way into the camp through
  unzipped area calling out to come into the world of nature's magic.Water slapping
  on the rocks mixed with gushing sound of freezing wind and trees mastered by the
  sweet chirping of birds made the nature's orchestra tune with the very part of soul
  that touches the boundaries of solitude and peace.The travel resumed to the Lower
  regions of Tosh from where we started trekking with bags on our backs scooching
  through the village and following the route paved  by nature's own architects.The
  very fascinating fact of nature is that it shows how humanely we are capable of
  love and care.Midnight,when the other world sleeps,the nature's beauty reveals.At
  the very late hour embracing the very company of each other in the middle of moon
  kissing the river with the moonlight and the trees and wind agreeing with him on
  the romantic revelation of love,i sat there wondering if i had said "NO".I sat there
  on the wooden log looking into the woods focusing on a squirrel who was starting
  to climb the tree in search of food made me question how desperately unhappy we
  are.This trip made me realize how uneducated i am in terms of knowledge being delivered
  every second and how to find the answers to every problem or Hurdle life send my
  way as a very great thinker has said "ANSWERS LIES IN THE SOLITUDE".
