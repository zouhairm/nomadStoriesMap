Text: "Deep in the San Francisco colors, beyond all of the daydream scenes I stood\
  \ looking at a tree, a tree like no other I must add. The tree hung to the side\
  \ like it was being pulled with some mystic sensation that I swore I recognized\
  \ from somewhere before. \nI was on the edge of the street right by the line dividing\
  \ the road and the sidewalk, cars flashed by and I felt their pull but I couldn\u2019\
  t look away, I felt as if I were in a trance of some kind.\nI finally looked away\
  \ and behind me a sweet looking old lady was looking at the same tree.\n\u201CIt\u2019\
  s beautiful isn\u2019t it.\u201D She said \nShe walked over to me and we talked\
  \ for a while about nature and the power it reigns over our wonder, she looked to\
  \ be about 50 from what I could tell.\nWe transcended into a gleaming conversation\
  \ about Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix, she talked to me about the delicate beauty\
  \ of San Francisco in the 60s, her smile exploded as she described the Monterey\
  \ Pop Festival to me.\n\u201CIt was like nothing before and nothing ever since.\u201D\
  \ She said\nShe told me that I was an old soul and we talked a little longer about\
  \ music, infinity and all of the joy and imagination consuming our words.\nShe said\
  \ that she was on her way to Muir Woods and if I\u2019d like to accompany her.\n\
  I said yes as a bird flew right by my left ear making a sonic sound.\nI walked with\
  \ her to the parking lot of a thrift shop which she said she owned.\nWe got to her\
  \ VW bus and I was immediately overjoyed this was a fantasy of mine to ride one\
  \ of these, It was splashed with psychedelic colors and mind bending art.\nOn the\
  \ road we said nothing she put on American Beauty by Grateful Dead and we listened\
  \ to it in peace looking out into the vastness of each town swollowing the next\
  \ town over.\nWhen we got to the trail we followed it up, in each square foot was\
  \ a beautiful nothingness overcome by something.\nThe trees glistened with a pouring\
  \  sunlight that shun in the same way that a song made you cry, there was a hint\
  \ of nostalgia in it all, in the sunlight, in the trees but most of all in this\
  \ sweet old lady that made me feel like I was a child on an adventure in the backyard\
  \ and for a moment I felt pure happiness.\nWe got to the top as the sun was setting,\
  \ the clouds looked like cotton candy on a youthful summer day. We sat on a rock\
  \ and looked out into a scene straight out of dream, the town looked to be pink\
  \ and the people looked tiny and problemless it was pure euphoria."
