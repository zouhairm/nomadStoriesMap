Text: "The Eternal Leader could have been sleeping if it weren\u2019t for the gleaming\
  \ case about his corpse.\n\nSet in the centre of the cavernous room his glass tomb\
  \ shone under the hot white light. In death he was flanked by four armed soldiers\
  \ watching stoic-faced from the dimly-lit perimeter.\n\nAs I stepped quietly from\
  \ the darkness toward where he lay, intrigue and anxiety flashed across the soldiers\u2019\
  \ faces. Outsiders were a rarity in the world\u2019s most reclusive nation, and\
  \ it was highly unusual that they would be allowed to see the Eternal Leader.\n\n\
  It was five years to the day that the North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Il had died.\
  \ I had lined up for hours that morning in the snow amongst weeping men and women\
  \ eager to pay their respects to a man they revered even in death. A lady told me\
  \ that today was her wedding day, but she and her husband both agreed visiting the\
  \ Eternal Leader was far more important.\n\nI approached the tomb slowly stopping\
  \ at an arm\u2019s length. Gently lowering my gaze, I paid the Eternal Leader the\
  \ first of three bows he was owed before stepping back. For the first and maybe\
  \ last time of my life, I looked upon the face of Kim Jong-Il; aggressor to the\
  \ South, hero to the North.\n\nHe lay on his back with his eyes closed and his head\
  \ on a round white pillow. A red velvet blanket tucked his arms by his sides while\
  \ his toes made a small mound at its base.  His trademark collared khaki shirt and\
  \ combed black hair framed his silent face, but he was not wearing his usual rounded\
  \ glasses. He did not need them anymore.\n\nI bowed for the second time.\n\nKim\
  \ Jong-Il was accused of leading his country into famine, sponsoring state terrorism,\
  \ and abusing human rights. Many Western countries considered him an enemy of democracy\
  \ and peace as he represented the world\u2019s most oppressive government.\n\nYet\
  \ despite facing widespread hardship, North Koreans still travel from across the\
  \ country to excitedly experience a fleeting glimpse of the man seen framed in every\
  \ home. In their eyes he was their savior, protecting them and delivering prosperity.\
  \ \n\nUnder the sharp light illuminating his wax-like skin he did almost look god-like.\
  \ It occurred to me that for many, this man would always be considered as such.\n\
  \nI was unable to reconcile these two opposing perspectives in any meaningful way\
  \ in the thirty seconds I was in his presence.\n\nInstead, under the anxious watch\
  \ of the soldiers, I bowed for the third and final time and quietly departed, leaving\
  \ Kim Jong-Il to his eternal sleep."
