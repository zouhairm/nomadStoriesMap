Text: "\u201CIt was many years ago that we decided to put down our weapons, but we\
  \ never gave up our hope: a free and independent Corsica. It is for this reason\
  \ \u2026\u201D. The barista turns off the radio with a gesture of impatience. I\
  \ can\u2019t see anything in his eyes. I was told that Corsicans are very proud\
  \ of their identity. So maybe he has realized I am a foreigner and he doesn\u2019\
  t want me to listen to the voice of his people. Yes, must be. He doesn\u2019t even\
  \ look at me. Or maybe he can\u2019t stand that voice?\nI leave the caf\xE9. Calvi\
  \ is blanketed in snow. This little wonder, set in the silver sea, changes its skin\
  \ before my eyes. The ochre of the walls and the blue of the sea get lost in the\
  \ white of the snow. It is a rare event here. Snow means the mountainous Corsica.\
  \ It has nothing to do with the coastal Corsica. \nI take a booklet out of my pocket.\
  \ An antiques dealer in Calvi \u2013 a mustached man with olive skin in his fifties\
  \ \u2013 gave it to me. It is written in Calvi dialect. \u201CNone of this makes\
  \ any sense for you, I know\u201D, he said. \u201CBut it is similar to Ligurian\
  \ dialect. Here in Corsica you can find many dialects, many differences, many divisions.\
  \ It is all so inexplicable. How can I explain something I feel, but I don\u2019\
  t fully understand?\u201D.\nI walk on the west quay of the marina. With the booklet\
  \ in my hands, I try to grasp something. There is an old angler sitting just in\
  \ a few meters. Instinctively I get close to him and I sit. The silent noise of\
  \ the sea, the long wait and that weird mix between white and blue. He looks at\
  \ me and then looks at the booklet in my hands.   \n\u201CWhat are you doing here?\u201D\
  , he asks me.\nI say nothing back. Probably nothing of significance. Ah yes, I say\
  \ something mundane about snow. He definitely starts talking again: \u201CWell,\
  \ a Colombian woman, who has been living in Calvi for many years, was sitting here\
  \ where we now stand just yesterday. Right at that moment it started to snow. She\
  \ said: \u201CIn Colombia, in the places where I grew up, the four seasons don\u2019\
  t exist. Snow is something magic. Here too, it is unusual. I have always desired\
  \ to wake up, put my head out the window and be slightly touched by snowflakes.\
  \ And now here I am, living this magic and imagining the same magic in my faraway\
  \ land\u201D.  \nTales of two differents worlds coming together. Tales of many different\
  \ worlds coming together. The old angler is offering me a message. Now I am its\
  \ preserver."
