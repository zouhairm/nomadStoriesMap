Text: "I was navigating the map application on my phone to check the name of the ruins\
  \ when a pop-up message appeared \"Download South Ossetia Map.\"\n\nThis was after\
  \ trekking around 10 kilometers in Truso Valley, Georgia. It was one of the relaxing\
  \ hikes I ever did. The Caucasus mountains surrounding the valley were splendid.\n\
  \nAlthough I was smiling I had enough share of fear. The end of 10 km valley is\
  \ a border from the side of Georgia and not away from it is South Osettia. The place\
  \ is Zakagori.\n\nOne of the police with a gun slung over his shoulder approached\
  \ me. I maintained the friendly smile.\n\n\u201CPassport,\u201D he said. I hurriedly\
  \ searched the pockets of my backpack and handed him my Philippine Passport. \u201C\
  Here\u2019s also my printed e-visa,\u201D I added and showed him the paper.\n\n\
  Another police said something in a louder voice and the only word I understand is\
  \ \u201Ctelephone.\u201D\n\nOh, my! My hands were trembling. I understand that they\
  \ want to check my phone and I pretend that I didn\u2019t understand.\n\n\u201C\
  Georgian? Russian?\u201D The police asked me.\n\n\u201CNyet,\u201D a Russian word\
  \ which means \u201Cno\u201D was all I able to reply with an apologetic gesture.\n\
  \nHe tried to explain that it is not allowed to take a photo on the border area.\
  \ I may not understand the language he used but I understand his message.\n\nThen\
  \ he asked for my phone. I had two. I gave him the other phone to check while I\
  \ secretly erased some photos I took near the border from the other phone.\n\nIt\
  \ seems the police became my friend when I took back my phone as he was scanning\
  \ already my selfies. He was laughing.\n\nBut the ordeal--- didn\u2019t end yet.\
  \ I can\u2019t go up to the fortress!\n\nI was already talking to the police in\
  \ English requesting to let me explore the uphill. He allowed me for 15 minutes.\n\
  \nLooking up to the ruins, I was sure I couldn\u2019t do it within the allotted\
  \ time. I was pleading. He said 20 minutes and he will keep my passport. I didn't\
  \ expect that someone will be interested to keep my passport.\n\nI barely make direct\
  \ eye contact with strangers but I did that time. No words but a sincere look that\
  \ conveys messages of a begging heart. I want to explore the ruins of a fortress.\n\
  \nIt worked!\n\nHe was firm when he said 30 minutes. It was either I will take it\
  \ or not! Passport or Zakagori Fortress, I chose the latter.\n\nThe countdown for\
  \ 30 minutes started. I ran towards the hill. The ascent wants me to slow down but\
  \ I didn\u2019t have enough time. I do treasure those moments.\n\nBefore the half\
  \ hour was over, my Philippine Passport was with me."
