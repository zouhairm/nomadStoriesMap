Text: "What would you think if you had the opportunity to stay in a hell hole or go\
  \ to paradise? That\u2019s exactky what I thought writing these words while thinking\
  \ about how .. how hard it is for me to go to a different country and just the fact\
  \ that I have no money and I want to study abroad makes me feel sad .. how would\
  \ you feel if you were with people who everyday made you feel like they\u2019re\
  \ not worth anything but still can\u2019t say a word when they mess up .. that\u2019\
  s how I feel.\n\nIt\u2019s 2018 and I desire to go to America to right my wrongs\
  \ cause by not showing up on the gcse exam day I did take the exam and it was a\
  \ new curriculum and we didn\u2019t know until a day in advanced it was so and we\
  \ had revision classes instead of normal ones and being the one who\u2019s smart\
  \ I usually get misunderstood,.. yes yes I know what you are saying boo hoo another\
  \ person who\u2019s booing his life cause he didn\u2019t turn up for his exam or\
  \ he thinks he\u2019s too smart and thinks the teachers are dumb. Believe me I\u2019\
  ve truly tried ,tried to see thing there way .I\u2019ve tried to understand there\
  \ way of life I\u2019ve tried to prove to them I\u2019m smarter and even \u2014\
  - You know what i know I am smart and I have proven to the teachers I am smart ,\
  \ but what\u2019s the point of proving it to someone I don\u2019t knwo"
