Text: "When you are unable to travel far, looking in your own town can lead to a great\
  \ story. The best part of New Jersey, in my opinion, is the vast amount of lore\
  \ and myths that lie hidden in the small state. From monsters to ghosts and various\
  \ oddities in between, there is no short supply of interesting places to find and\
  \ they are all in a publication called Weird NJ. In my town, Tabernacle, there is\
  \ history turned ghost story residing in our section of the Pine Barrens. \n   \
  \ This is how the story goes: July 13th, 1928 there was a plane that crashed and\
  \ the pilot died. The pilot, Captain Emilio Carranza, was traveling from New York\
  \ to Mexico City with nothing more than a handheld flashlight when an electrical\
  \ storm overtook him. Today, for those the only sign that it had ever occurred is\
  \ a humble stone monument and an annual memorial service. This is where the ghost\
  \ story begins. There is a ritual that is used to summon a ghostly happening, according\
  \ to local lore. The ritual goes: park your car outside the gate of the memorial\
  \ at night, flash the car lights and yell \u201CEmilio\u201D three times, turn your\
  \ car completely off. Supposedly after that, you will see the ghost of his plane.\
  \ \n    My friend, who was a true local, and I decided to try this for ourselves.\
  \ We took a less-than-cool van down the isolated Carranza Road. We passed by quaint\
  \ farms, then homes, then a juvenile detention center before finally reaching the\
  \ uninhabited woods, getting darker quick. We almost past the memorial, it is an\
  \ easy thing to miss as it sits among the trees, and began the ritual. We waited\
  \ but nothing happened until we attempted to start the van when it stalled. The\
  \ haunting had begun. We spotted lights, high in the sky and at a distance, just\
  \ an ordinary plane? The car finally started and we pulled out meanwhile the lights\
  \ approached closer and lower. As we drove away the lights seemed to follow us,\
  \ too high to be a truck but too low to be a plane. We almost thought the lights\
  \ would run into us when they suddenly vanished and we finally realized how perfectly\
  \ silent the woods had become. \n    It was during this experience I finally felt\
  \ more like a local and not an outsider-resident. Was it truly a ghost? Perhaps\
  \ not, but I still found a connection with the local lore and thus with the town\
  \ itself. To experience a piece local history will be an experience I\u2019ll never\
  \ forget. Just goes to show how even somewhere that seems mundane can still have\
  \ something interesting to find."
