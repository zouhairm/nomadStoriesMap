Text: "I met Antonio as I squeezed into the last seat in a dark green jeep with 11\
  \ Italian men on a hot afternoon in May. His kind eyes reflected in the mirror as\
  \ he drove up hairpin switchbacks to the hilltop above Poggio Bustone, Italy. Antonio\
  \ was taking me flying.\n I was in Umbria as part of my third walk, a 30-day pilgrimage\
  \ from Florence to Assisi to Rome. I walked the Camino Frances, from southern France\
  \ to Santiago, Spain in 2015 just after learning my mother was dying of pancreatic\
  \ cancer. The next year, my brother died while I was walking from Porto, Portugal\
  \ to Santiago.  Since my father had died in 2013, I was the last in our family line.\
  \ The Way of St. Francis was MY pilgrimage. I was in Italy to find joy.\n Even before\
  \ the jeep stopped, everyone leapt to unload. The billowing multi-colored sails\
  \ laid against the parched hillside looked like graceful ballerinas on a tufted\
  \ ocean. The wide valley floor framed by steep verdant peaks put my tiny human life\
  \ into perspective.\n After 4 men had launched, I was next. Antonio instructed for\
  \ the fourth time, \u201CStep into the harness and pull it up. As we take flight,\
  \ pass me the go-pro, replace each of your arms into the harness and slide your\
  \ butt back in the seat.\u201D I looked; there was no seat. Surely it would be obvious\
  \ when the time came.\n \u201CRun toward the cliff until the wind catches hold of\
  \ the sail,\u201D he said, \u201CIt will pull you back, hard.\u201D I ran and WOOSH!\
  \ Air sucked from my belly as our tandemed bodies were pulled back HARD, (he wasn\u2019\
  t kidding) \u2013 up and away from the hill until my feet dangled over the patchwork\
  \ tapestry of golden fields bisected by meandering roads and glistening rivers.\
  \ It was a perfect day for flying.\n \u201CFlying\u201D is profoundly peaceful.\
  \ We floated freely, soaring in wide circles, making dips and turn - effortless,\
  \ weightless, free. Just the sound of the wind in my ears. It was bliss. I\u2019\
  d found joy.\n I had no idea how important flying would be to my pilgrimage. Instead\
  \ of rigid adherence to daily walking, finding food, sleeping, and rising the next\
  \ day to repeat, MY pilgrimage was different. I took a day off; I parasailed, because\
  \ now, it\u2019s my turn to live joy. My family life had been hard - oldest daughter\
  \ to a single mother, mental illness, poverty, substance abuse\u2026learning to\
  \ put joy first is not automatic. Sometimes I must leap, do something that isn\u2019\
  t normal - to break from old routines. Running to the cliff offered just that. I\
  \ trust that by taking inspired leaps, joy will be my new normal."
