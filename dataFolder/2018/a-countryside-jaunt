Text: "We decided to go ahead with our plans to visit Palestine despite hearing Trump\u2019\
  s announcement that he intended to move the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.\
  \ Having made a connection with a local farmer named Murad via a mutual facebook\
  \ friend, the opportunity seemed too good to pass up. \nWe arrived in Ramallah armed\
  \ with only a telephone number and the name of the village where Murad lives. Murad\
  \ had instructed us to find a specific cab line outside the KFC and then find a\
  \ driver who would call and be given directions.\nAided by a young local who spoke\
  \ English we were eventually ushered into a shared cab and whisked out of the urban\
  \ sprawl and into the hills past olive groves and housing settlements.  \nMurad\
  \ met us and spent the morning sharing stories of his life in Palestine and dreams\
  \ of a sustainable farming enterprise that also doubled as an education facility.\
  \ \nAs the afternoon approached it was time to consider the route home. Murad checked\
  \ his phone and remarked that things were \u201Clooking a little tense\u201D in\
  \ Ramallah. He called a driver but he couldn\u2019t get through as roads had begun\
  \ being shut down by guards. \nEventually, after a series of drivers collecting\
  \ us and dropping us off at various check points, we found ourselves back in Ramallah.\
  \ The city was now alive with protest we had a growing sense of our need to make\
  \ an exit quickly.  \nAfter confused negotiations with taxi drivers we were told\
  \ we wouldn\u2019t make it back across the border to Israel, there were no buses\
  \ and there was potentially no way out until the following day. \nFinally, we found\
  \ someone who would make the drive to the checkpoint at which point we could have\
  \ to walk. As we approached the border the traffic came to a standstill and the\
  \ driver, communicating through his friend on the phone who spoke English, told\
  \ us we were better off jumping out now and walking from there. \nSo we did. Under\
  \ soft fire from soldiers, through rock throwing from young children and skip bins\
  \ pushed on their sides and set alight, we held our hands over our heads to protect\
  \ our faces and walked at speed towards where we perceived the checkpoint to be.\
  \ \nWe handed over our respective passports to the armed guards and were sternly\
  \ pointed in the direction of the Israeli local buses with no questions asked. \n\
  Later that evening I messaged Murad to let him know we had arrived back in Jerusalem\
  \ safely after a few \u201Ccomplications.\u201D \n\u201CNice to meet you,\u201D\
  \ was his simple reply."
