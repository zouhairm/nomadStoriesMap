Text: "A month  searching for The Ticket, when Sofia and Pietro have to choose the\
  \ trip always live moments of delirium as if it was the last travel of their life:\
  \ \"This one seems to me the best offer!\" - \"I can not return September 17, you\
  \ know!\" - \"Ok but if we come back before prices will raise\" - \"We will find\
  \ a good one!\" - \"Look for it and when you found it call me!\", shortly after\
  \ \"This is perfect 500 euro to go and return!\" - \"For Costa Rica?\" - \"Where\
  \ to? We will land in San Juan on August 20th \". Travelbook bought, so begins the\
  \ thrill of programming itinerary and the foretaste of places, smells, plants and\
  \ exotic animals,Sofia had two dreams: stay in silent and watch the moves in slow\
  \ motion of the sloth and be able to take a bath with the shy manati. The day of\
  \ departure is approaching but strangely they can not check in , a lettering \"\
  No esta data\" appears. They call the free number and the lazy august clerk reassures\
  \ them, \"Terminals are blocked but your flight is confirmed\". It is August 19,\
  \ Pietro's birthday, they would have stopped in Madrid and toast there, waiting\
  \ for the great crossing towards the only demilitarized biodiversity lung in the\
  \ world. Proceedings electrified with that sense of anxiety typical of waiting,\
  \ the smiling hostess: \"Well, Fiumicino-Puerto Rico with a stop in Madrid\", Sofia\
  \ winces \"Excuse me?\", she impassive \"Fiumicino-San Juan di Puerto Rico\". She\
  \ understood well, turns to Peter and sees in front of her eyes beaches, volcanoes,\
  \ sulphurous spas, sea giants, her mind is blurred and screams breaking the airport\
  \ decibels: \"COSTA RICA not Puerto Rico!\", the lady always annoyingly calm: \"\
  Recheck, here it is Puerto Rico, the code is SJU while for Costa Rica it would be\
  \ SJO \",\" Recheck!\", she can not understand, the salivation stops and looks at\
  \ Pietro, also astounded but with attitude, \"Place for me Puerto Rico on the map,\
  \  I'm feeling bad! \", he simulates a resolute tone:\" It's still in the Caribbean\
  \ \", behind them a stranger impassioned to the story:\" But i\u2019t\u2019s great\
  \ you're not going to Canicatt\xEC \". The seraphic hostess: \"I confirm the flight,\
  \ do you have the Esta?\" - \"What?\", Resounds that enigmatic word of the mail.\
  \ Two Neapolitan girls hound : \"You will see that  Puerto Rico is super cool and\
  \ the Esta is done in a moment, but be careful, however, because Internet is fool\
  \ of scams!\" Sofia hears those words as in a distant echo, observes the sparkling\
  \ girls and ask in a catatonic way \"What animals are there in Puerto Rico?\""
