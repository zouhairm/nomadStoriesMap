Text: "As I was serving as a missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day\
  \ Saints, My companion and i were walking the dusty roads of Paran\xE1, Argentina.\
  \ We were following our daily routine in the blazing heat of September, talking\
  \ to the local people while we walked to our assigned appointment. Here we were,\
  \ 2 boys at the age of 18 in a foreign country, trying to speak Spanish, in white\
  \ shirts and ties while it\u2019s 90 degrees outside, makes a good cover story,\
  \ haha. Everybody always looking at us wondering who we were, but it made it easier\
  \ for us to strike a conversation with them. Sometimes it can be frightening but\
  \ the message we carried was priceless. We knew it would make them happy.\nAfter\
  \ visiting the woman we had fixed an appointment with and having been sadly disappointed\
  \ by a no answer from the door, we began walking down new roads to find new people.\
  \ After having gone down a few slim alley ways, we finally decided to continue down\
  \ a discontinued road. Where the pavement ended we saw some houses further down\
  \ on a dirt path. We were intrigued to explore. The houses were made of mud and\
  \ tin, many poor farmers with their families lived here and those are the kind of\
  \ people we live talking to. With frustration we quickly realized it was the siesta,\
  \ and everybody was sleeping or eating and didn\u2019t want to talk to us. We pressed\
  \ on and found a river, we crossed and to our surprise a whole new neighborhood\
  \ we didn\u2019t even know existed. Being so excited, we ran and talked to as many\
  \ people as we could. The time came to go, so we started back the way we came, but\
  \ an unexpected surprise awaited.\nWalking across the field before the river, 3\
  \ kids came running up behind us. We were going to let them pass as we stopped until\
  \ we realized they were coming after us. We started running but I was too late,\
  \ they grabbed my companion and I. They took our backpacks, wallets, and all we\
  \ had In our pockets, but this escalated worse than a normal robbery. 1 of the kids\
  \ pulls out a knife and stabs my companion twice, but after a miraculous occurrence\
  \ of no injury, they told him to leave. I was then attacked by the other 2 who were\
  \ robbing my companion. After being punched and kicked in the eye, they finally\
  \ left. My companion came and got me and we left. Walking down the streets with\
  \ a black eye, bloody face, and torn clothed wasn\u2019t expected, but I guess nothing\
  \ is on a mission. Every day you never know what to expect."
