Text: "I\u2019ve always not been able to meet up with our last Friday of the month\
  \ hangout, due to the demands of my beat. But, after about 30 minutes delay in traffic,\
  \ I eventually met my friends. We exchanged pleasantries and, immediately, ordered\
  \ for some drinks, according to our choice brands. As we began to chat about the\
  \ abducted Chibok girls, a friend challenged me and even placed a bet of N100, 000\
  \ ($279.33 approximately) that no journalist in Nigeria, including me, can go to\
  \ Borno State, for an exclusive reports on life after abduction of the girls. All\
  \ through the night I pondered over the risk, the challenges and, if I could even\
  \ succeed in proving to my friend that nothing is impossible in this 21st Century,\
  \ especially when believes in the Almighty God. Penultimate weekend, I wrote a note\
  \ about my proposed trip and why I chose to embark on such risky trip; alluding\
  \ that, in case I don\u2019t make it back alive, I will still become a journalist\
  \ in another live, if there is any. Dressed in full Hausa regalia, I took off for\
  \ the journey to far-away Gamboru town in Gamboru Ngala Local Government Area, Maiduguri,\
  \ Borno State capital, North-east of Nigeria, near Chad Republic.\n\nSince I can\
  \ read, write and speak Hausa Language fluently, it wasn\u2019t difficult to get\
  \ to the village. I met a slim, tall Kanuri woman, probably in her mid-40s, whose\
  \ only daughter was among the abducted Chibok School girls. It\u2019s been four\
  \ years since 276 female students were kidnapped from the Government Secondary School\
  \ in the town of Chibok. But what has kept her going was love, while grieving is\
  \ for a life-time. Her words: \u201CFor as long as I breathe, I will grieve in pain,\
  \ and die loving my only child. Do you know what disturbs me most? It is the thought\
  \ of how a generation of future leaders, ambitious youths were taken away, and may\
  \ never be seen again by their parents and play mates. Grandchildren that should\
  \ have been, but will never be born! That\u2019s a life-time pain without healing.\u201D\
  \n\nI was speechless and motionless for about 10 minutes, tears flowing down my\
  \ chin. As I stood up to go, I reached out to my wrist and gave her two of my bracelets\
  \ made of beads, as a sign that her daughter will come back alive. Within the last\
  \ two years, some of the girls have been rescued, but more than 100 are still missing.\
  \ She smiled and I waved her goodbye. Deep inside of me, I pray her daughter comes\
  \ back alive. I have achieved the impossible and I\u2019m glad I took a decision\
  \ that pushed me to the edge."
