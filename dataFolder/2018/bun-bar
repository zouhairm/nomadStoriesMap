Text: "I like to think that strangers are often friends you haven\u2019t met yet.\
  \ \n\nThought these friends maybe transitory, uninvited to your birthdays, people\
  \ you never receive Christmas cards from or ones you added on social media but have\
  \ never traded comments, they are featured in stories that you tell others many\
  \ years after.\n\nOne such person is Juan-Jan \n\nFor a country bumpkin, London\
  \ is always an exciting and somewhat daunting experience. There are often more people\
  \ in the hostel I stay in than there are in my village, but there is also so much\
  \ more life and I find myself like an insect drawn to the bright lights and bustling\
  \ streets of the big city. \n\nMy trips to London often see me catching a coach\
  \ that arrive at 6 am and leaves again at 11:30 pm. Between the times that I have\
  \ business, I often find myself looking for entertainment, more than likely ending\
  \ up in my favorite haunts between the West End, China town and Soho. Here, where\
  \ I  find cultures I rarely meet, sits one of my favourites eateries- a Bun bar\
  \ on the corner in Romilly street. The place has few of it green china seats and\
  \ is often very busy,  this day was no exception. I took a seat at a two-person\
  \ table, sitting half in a plant pot and ordered two steam buns and the chicken\
  \ wings. A girl entered the crowded bar and saw the seat I had free, asking if she\
  \ could take it. I welcomed her to the table of one and we got talking,  starting\
  \ with a comment about the lack of seating. The girl, Juan-Jan, was an administrator\
  \ at a local tech company selling products overseas and often came to this bar after\
  \ work. I told her about my work with the Natural History Museum which she found\
  \ interesting but was a little repulsed by the insects I studied. We ended up sharing\
  \ a pot of tea as the night began to draw in and the January winds cooled the place.\
  \ After talking some more both of us found ourselves with free evenings, so we teamed\
  \ up to find entertainment in our shared love of musicals. She knew of other theatres\
  \ outside of the west end took me to the 'Old Vic' were we saw the toe-tapping 'Ground\
  \ Hog day'. Afterwards indulging in a 'unicorn milkshakes', a concoction of sugar\
  \ and colours before I had to regretfully leave for my bus.\n \nI do not know if\
  \ Juan-Jan is still in that admin job, for though we didn't share any contact details\
  \ I intend to go back to my favorite Bun bar to ask her. For now, I can now say\
  \ there is one more stranger in London that I can call a friend."
