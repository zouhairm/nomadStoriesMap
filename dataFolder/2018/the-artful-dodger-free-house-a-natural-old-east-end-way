Text: "London. Walking down the left side of Royal Mint Street, direction Tower Bridge,\
  \ Blue Anchor Yard corner, there is a modest free house (seriously damaged by the\
  \ Nazi Lutwaffe\u2019s blitz in WWII), in which all the cityworkers, who frenetically\
  \ run up and down the road, don\u2019t usually go. Some might have seen it from\
  \ the passing DLR train, some might have not. The Artful Dodger is not what a modern\
  \ pub looks like. It is a local and familiar space, in which nothing has the arrogance\
  \ to be what is not. On a rambling afternoon, one of my firsts in the city of London,\
  \ I decided that it was the right time to have a look inside and read a book (Milan\
  \ Kundera\u2019s \u201CThe Unbearable Lightness of Being\u201D). \u201CSorry for\
  \ the mess, we just wanted to make you feel at home\u201D. This is the sign that\
  \ you can read, on the left besides the spirits, as soon as your elbows are on the\
  \ counter to order your pint. The simplicity and the normality of this pub immediately\
  \ impresses me as soon as I take the first step inside. The atmosphere is pleasantly\
  \ familiar. After a few pages (and a beer), I started talking and interacting with\
  \ the managers about the pub and the history hidden behind it. He gave me a confidential\
  \ letter of 2014, written by Henry Thomas Bristow\u2019s grandson, owner between\
  \ 1910s and 1920s. The first name of the free house was The Crown and Seven Stars,\
  \ with \u201Cthree servants, a cook, a barman and a barmaid\u201D, as I read from\
  \ an attached document (1911 Census). Originally established in a former warehouse\
  \ around the beginning of 19th century, it changed the name in The Artful Dodger\
  \ in 1985. Apparentley, it was renowned as a gathering point for the soldiers during\
  \ WWI. \u201CWe want to make our customers feel at home. That\u2019s our philosoph,\
  \ our way. What else do you have to do?\" tells me Danny, the owner of the Artful\
  \ Dodger together with his wife, Georgina. Both of them have lived in the this area\
  \ for more than 25 years, managing the pub since 2014. The styling here is very\
  \ old fashioned. A very characteristic East End vintage pub. It\u2019s a one room\
  \ space, similar to a local living room, with a proper English dark red wall to\
  \ wall carpet, wooden bar counter, smokey flavours, few tables and a pool table\
  \ at the entrance. An old disused fireplace is placed at the bottom of the pub.\
  \ For those who have been looking for a very local atmosphere, this is the place\
  \ to be. \u201CThe decorations and the style reflect what we can call the philosophy\
  \ of the bar, a natural old east end way\u201D Danny argues"
