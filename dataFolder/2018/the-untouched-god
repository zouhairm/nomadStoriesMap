Text: "The untouched God- Resort of Goa\nThe overview of the small cottage from the\
  \ sea shore, in this middle of the midnight is clear but a little strange, as if\
  \ a dream is creating its reality, as if the design of the dream was created to\
  \ draw an infinity lines of this presence\u2026..I made my way to the entrance to\
  \ the first floor of this cottage. The first floor is a long hall, at its end a\
  \ soft master bed and the legs of the bed is abreast a door which leads to a small\
  \ balcony. The softness of the night is clear in its breeze, it\u2019s a full moon\
  \ night, you can hear the ashore soft sounds making the moments cold and bright\u2026\
  ..\nIt\u2019s a summer midnight but the breezes are a tickling of cold breath, a\
  \ constant breeze making a flute sounds. These sounds are not even disturbing the\
  \ stillness peacefulness of this night. The moon light marching from the sky toward\
  \ its view point traveling through the corners of the ventilators, through the open\
  \ windows where the curtain are floating as curves, like the waters in its ashore\
  \ coming and again drifting towards its origination, as the white curtains sparkling\
  \ more with its moon light\u2026..\nThe peacefulness the soft smell of the water\
  \ sand, the first rain perfume, my mind started drifting, making me feel the love\
  \ in this haunted hall, I made my way towards the balcony where she must be waiting\
  \ for me so long. I entered the balcony where she is standing facing the sea,,,,,\
  \ the beauty is what is belongs to, love has again grown hard, a magical spell which\
  \ has hallucinated me. She is wearing a white noodle strap tunic ending at her knees.\
  \ The calmness which have stopped the time with the cold breeze summer midnight\
  \ under the full moon sky. Her eyes are closed with which she is enjoying the abreast\
  \ beauty with her own imagination.She has already sensed my presence, as I moved\
  \ closer to her I could listen to her deep breaths, the small puffs of hot breaths\
  \ against the cool breeze. I softly brushed up my finger from the top of her shoulder\
  \ to the tip of her fingers, her locks of hair are free and are floating it the\
  \ waves of the breeze some wants to go against still some are blowing, the white\
  \ pale skin shining more in the moon light, she than turns towards me, still her\
  \ eyes closed, as if she wants to still up this moments at an infinite endless moments.\
  \ A last I could see her eyes opened the stillness the calmness that are present\
  \ in her eyes are visible. As if I have fallen in love again."
