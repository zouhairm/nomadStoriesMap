Text: "\u201CYou. Are. My. Soniyaaaaaaa!\u201D Bollywood\u2019s greatest hits echo\
  \ through the tinny speakers of our \u201Crented\u201D Honda hatchback as we bounce\
  \ down a heavily trodden dirt track in a lush green valley.  I say \u201Crented\u201D\
  \ because I am pretty sure our \u201Cguide,\u201D Yoko, just borrowed this car from\
  \ a friend.   After passing farmers tending to fields of scorching hot chili peppers,\
  \ local tobacco and watermelons, the little black car stops bouncing at the beach.\
  \ \nOn the shore, I look down and immediately start collecting the best of millions\
  \ of shells when I notice that the grains of sand are round. The beach is covered\
  \ with ultra granular, rock and shell flavored Dippin\u2019 Dots ice cream.\nBut\
  \ before I bend down and starting eating the sand, I hear Yoko hoot.  The surf is\
  \ all-time! Surfing - that\u2019s why I used to come here.  However, every year\
  \ since I stopped by the Surfer\u2019s Bar on a mutual friend\u2019s recommendation,\
  \ I come back to visit my Lombok family.\nI leave Valentina, age three, to collect\
  \ crabs and fish in a plastic bottle with Yoko while I go surfing.  Not long ago,\
  \ very few westerners felt comfortable in Lombok.  In the early 2000s, violent religious\
  \ riots aimed at outsiders left tourists and expats running back to Bali for their\
  \ lives.  Yet today, as the people of Lombok learn to coexist with increasing tourism,\
  \ they are becoming our best friends and favorite babysitters.  \nYoko summed this\
  \ trend up with eloquence:  \"I am Muslim.  But I am a rock and roll Muslim.\" \
  \ These days, being Muslim in Lombok means you can love Bollywood Music, make lasting\
  \ friendships with foreigners and teach a three-year-old how to eat corn on the\
  \ cob, Lombok-style, while drinking a Bintang.  \nVisiting my Lombok family is a\
  \ lot like visiting my real family but with fewer arguments.  We catch up over meals\
  \ (usually \u201Cbike rice,\u201D a spicy rice delivered in a banana leaf by motorcycle),\
  \ play with the dogs, hold new babies and laugh.  Valentina hangs out in the kitchen\
  \ of the Surfer Bar and chases kittens while Lombok Mama works.  At night she sleeps\
  \ on the floor of the family\u2019s cinder block home while we listen to Indonesian\
  \ reggae bands in the bar.  \nAlthough the Dippin\u2019 Dots beaches, Kool-Aid blue\
  \ lagoons, and delectable surf breaks make for great Instagram material, I don\u2019\
  t come back to take photos. Months later, when my little daughter lights up while\
  \ talking about \u201CUncle Yoko,\u201D I realize that even she knows that the best\
  \ trips are made by the friends you make rather than the pictures you take."
