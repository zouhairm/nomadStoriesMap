Text: "Stepping out of the car, I felt the warm breeze enter into the pores of my\
  \ skin. Carrying all the dirt, dust and thousands of other types of particles clogging\
  \ the tiny openings covering my body, but I didn\u2019t care. As I walked towards\
  \ the mouth of the trail, my senses seemed to intermix. Rather than being separate\
  \ smell, sight, sound, they became a mash of everything. The sun was something I\
  \ could hear, the wind a sweet taste, and the ground under my feet felt like a powerful\
  \ sound that reverberated against my body, shaking up to my ears. \n The park rangers\
  \ said that the trail was a mile long, measured by flight of bird, walking along\
  \ the trail I understood that the trail was going to feel much longer than a mile.\
  \ My first couple steps lead me into the same flight as whatever the specified bird\
  \ was. My wings flapped along with theirs, my senses as separate and as clear as\
  \ day now. The whoosh of my wings, the breeze through my feathers, the inexplicable\
  \ sight within my eyes.\n Back to reality, I walk alongside my parents on the trail\
  \ within the famous Arches National Park.  A landscape in which I thought of as\
  \ bland and dry, like stepping on to the ground in an area such as this would immediately\
  \ make your mouth as dry as shoving ten crackers in at once would. To my surprise,\
  \ it was the exact opposite. Within the bone-dry rock I hiked upon, I experienced\
  \ the rush of moisture throughout the land. A different type of cannonballing into\
  \ water, one that I experience through the life running about the land. The only\
  \ plant life I expected to see, was dead and dry, which I was completely right,\
  \ and I loved it. The vines and dried leaves of each plant I stepped past became\
  \ art to me, paintings done by Van Gogh, weaving of the branches were a silent Shakespearean\
  \ play. \n The feeling of being so connected with the earth, body and soul, brought\
  \ me to see how interconnected humans and nature are and how ignorant we are to\
  \ that fact. Humans so often see the earth as something we are above, a separate,\
  \ more powerful entity. The reality of it all is that we aren\u2019t above it, we\
  \ are within it.  \n         I came into this trip looking at it as a relaxing vacation.\
  \ I found that relaxation, not by sitting by a pool, but through my mind being freed.\
  \ An experience such as this is not one that you can gain from living the same life\
  \ day in and day out, you gain this from seeing the world and becoming something\
  \ natural in what is an unnatural area to you."
