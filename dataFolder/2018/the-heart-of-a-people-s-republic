Text: "My wife and I were on our honeymoon in Vietnam. Specifically, we were in Hanoi\
  \ which was the first stop on our multi-city tour of the Southeast Asian country.\
  \ We had just spent the day walking up to Ho Tay, also known as the West Lake. It\
  \ was one of the biggest lakes within the city with pagodas, temples, a park, memorial\
  \ museums near by, and the all important swan boats to take tourists' money away\
  \ from them. Needless to say, everything but the swan boats was amazing. We had\
  \ walked miles that day in the heat and humidity of any South East Asian country\
  \ that rendered both of us tired, light headed from heat exhaustion. \n\nBy the\
  \ time we had cooled ourselves down enough to function, we were hungry. In much\
  \ of our wanderings around Hanoi, we kept walking by a  restaurant called Cowboy\
  \ Jack's. It was advertised as an American restaurant which, being from the US,\
  \ we had to find out what that meant. Let's start off by saying that they weren't\
  \ completely wrong with most of it. We were sat next to the kitchen and watched\
  \ as racks of ribs the size of infants, smothered in barbecue sauce, sailed by with\
  \ only a half ear of corn, and a cup of coleslaw accompanying them. Half chickens\
  \ with baked beans sat under terrible wall murals of cowboys and (what we assumed)\
  \ Native Americans. Had my wife not been a vegetarian and we both didn't hate the\
  \ fake American-ness of the place, we might have stayed.\n\nWe didn't travel across\
  \ the world to see racks of ribs, we came to see little merchant women carrying\
  \ twice their body weight in produce. We wanted to see the oceans of people on scooter.\
  \ We wanted to see Vietnam for what it was. Apparently, all we had to do was got\
  \ to Hoan Kiem Lake, on a weekend night. Hoan Kiem Lake is not a big lake but on\
  \ the weekends, the city blocks off the surrounding streets from traffic and people\
  \ show up and do whatever they want. We were first greeted with children all swerving,\
  \ and cruising around in plastic cars that were modified with lights. As we walked,\
  \ couples were taking wedding photos. There were people in knock-off character costumes,\
  \ people playing hacky-sack with weird shuttlecocks that sounded painful to kick.\
  \ Stores were spilling their contents into the streets, groups of angsty teenagers\
  \ sat in circles playing angsty songs. Every ten feet were people performing, singing,\
  \ or playing something just to get attention or money. We found it's people letting\
  \ loose and sharing who they were for everyone to see. We had found a real Vietnam."
