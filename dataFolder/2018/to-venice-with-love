Text: "Lately I\u2019ve been consumed with the fear that I am going to work so hard\
  \ my entire life to be who I want to be that I will never be able to enjoy who I\
  \ am.\n\nI have this beautiful, clear vision of what it would finally mean to be\
  \ able to say \u201CI did it. I fulfilled my dream\u201D and on a day-to-day basis\
  \ this vision motivates me but it doesn\u2019t allow me to feel proud of the work\
  \ I\u2019ve done. It only makes me want to do more work: it\u2019s never enough\
  \ for me. A mentor I used to have said to me, \u201CCharlie Chaplin died saying\
  \ that he\u2019d never done anything good in his entire life.\u201D I don\u2019\
  t know if that\u2019s true but it\u2019s sure as hell sad. \n\nSo how do I define\
  \ success? This is the question that I have been left with. Success in my circus\
  \ career is finally being able to work for my dream company, make innovative art\
  \ and inspire people. That definition is easy even if getting there is impossible.\
  \ Contrary to popular belief though, my circus career is not all that I am. I care\
  \ about what\u2019s left after I\u2019m gone. Like Grandpa Martin Vanderhof says\
  \ in \u201CYou Can\u2019t Take It With You\u201D (my favorite play),  \u201C..,\
  \ So what good is it? As near as I can see, the only thing you can take with you\
  \ is the love of your friends.\u201D I can\u2019t take it with me. The money, the\
  \ fame, whatever else: it won\u2019t have staying power. \n\nMy grandmother recently\
  \ passed away and she was a kind, brave, and loving women. I will never forget the\
  \ way that my grandfather looked at her funeral when he said, \u201CI love her\u201D\
  \ like she was right there and she could hear him. The legacy that my grandma left,\
  \ of a loving husband and three brilliant sons: she took that with her. That\u2019\
  s with her right now. The love and power of her soul lives on: but the objects stay\
  \ behind, the money and the things, she didn't take with her. They don\u2019t matter\
  \ anymore.\n\nSo I finally did what my heart has been telling me for years now:\
  \ I bought my plane ticket to Venice. This is because the 60 hour work week that\
  \ I just had: I can\u2019t take that with me, the paycheck that I\u2019ll get tomorrow:\
  \ I can\u2019t take that with me, the 30 second one arm handstand that I held today:\
  \ I won\u2019t take it with me. The experiences that I have with the people I love:\
  \ I can take that with me. Memories have staying power. Once those memories are\
  \ made in Europe, I'll be going back to my home in Montana to reconnect with the\
  \ family that I miss so dearly. They have staying power. Success is for me is defined\
  \ by the imprint that my soul leaves behind: I'll make sure it's a good one."
