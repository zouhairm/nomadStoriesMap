Text: "What I remember most about the children's terminal illness ward in Morocco\
  \ was the silence. It was the kind of silence that made my own breathing seem over\
  \ the top.I stood outside the last door on the right for a long moment, self-consciously\
  \ adjusting my tutu and scratching at the red paint on my nose. \nI snuck a peek\
  \ at the very sick little girl who I would spend the next hour clowning for.She\
  \ was about six but looked younger, so delicate that the weight of her blanket seemed\
  \ too much to bear. \nI took a half step toward the door, a question.She smiled\
  \ her invitation.I tip-toed in, making a game of being quiet.Although this girl\
  \ laced up with tubes tied to machines spoke no English and I spoke no Arabic, we\
  \ were both fluent in giggle.The harder we tried to be silent, so as not to wake\
  \ her sleeping mom, the harder it got to contain the pent up squall of laughter\
  \ threatening to dump all over the sad grey hospital room with a soap opera babbling\
  \ from a mounted T.V. If I took a step that made noise, we overreacted and shushed\
  \ each other dramatically.I blew bubbles on her nose and she shook with silent laughter.I\
  \ tripped and pretended to fall under her bed and she giggled so loudly that her\
  \ mom woke up with a smile that will be burned in my guts until I'm dead.It was\
  \ as if she had forgotten the sound of her daughter's laughter and was thanking\
  \ me silently for its reincarnation.\nShe had been napping on a pile of cheap plaid\
  \ rice sacks which seemed to hold everything they owned.I imagined them packing\
  \ to live permanently in a hospital and it almost broke me. But mom was infused\
  \ with energy and intent on teaching me an Arabic dance.She manually moved my stiff\
  \ hips and I bungled the rhythm, causing both to explode in fits of giggles.Mom\
  \ would patiently demonstrate again and I would mess up. We were partners in slapstick,\
  \ needing laughter like air. We danced until we were all breathless.\nAnd just like\
  \ that, the little girl was tired. Really tired. I knew I should go but I couldn't\
  \ move. \nI kept thinking I wished I could do something to really help, but all\
  \ I could offer her was a fleeting moment of lightness.It would never be enough\
  \ but in this moment, it had to be. \nI stood in the doorway for a long moment,\
  \ saying goodbye to my new friend. She blew me a kiss which I saved in the pocket\
  \ of my clown pants.Her mom took my face in her hands and kissed my cheeks as if\
  \ I was her own blood. \nWe said \"Choukran\" at the same time, the only Arabic\
  \ word I knew. \nThank You."
