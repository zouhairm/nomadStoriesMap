Text: "For almost two years I lived in Taiwan and traveled to over 20 cities in 4\
  \ southeast Asian countries. Today, I returned to the USA.\n\nBut today does not\
  \ feel like a homecoming. I feel I am arriving at the border of an unfamiliar land.\
  \ Where Taiwan welcomed me, a foreigner, a stranger, and an immigrant, with open\
  \ arms; I arrive home to a government that would literally shut itself down, rather\
  \ than give immigrants exactly what I received.\n\nI feel kinship with the Taiwanese\
  \ people. It was never easy adjusting to a completely different world, yet the people\
  \ around me helped without hesitation. It was not long before I came to realize\
  \ Taiwan was my home.\n\nDuring the time that Taiwan gave me a home, it surpassed\
  \ the USA on an international ranking of freedom. During this time, it elected its\
  \ first female president, and became the first Asian nation to allow for marriage\
  \ equality.\n\nBut now, as I cross the border of the country I am supposed to call\
  \ home, I feel fear.\n\nI feel fear as I leave the country that gave me employment,\
  \ a resident card, and free health care, and wonder if I will even be given the\
  \ same as a US citizen.\n\nAs I cross this border, I feel sadness.\n\nI feel sadness\
  \ that, while the Taiwanese government welcomed my skills, my Taiwanese partner\
  \ was refused by dozens of US job applications that wanted to hire her, only on\
  \ the grounds that she cannot get a working visa. Today we left each other unwillingly,\
  \ uncertain of when we can meet again.\n\nAs I cross this border, I feel shame.\n\
  \nAfter making friendships, sharing classes, and traveling with individuals from\
  \ dozens of countries around the world, there have been countless times I have not\
  \ had the words to answer their questions. They ask me, as a graduate of politics\
  \ and business, \u201CWhy, as the world grows more open, does your country grow\
  \ more closed?\u201D\n\nWe are living in grave times, and I hope no one underestimates\
  \ the gravity of the state of the modern world. The US is far from the only example\
  \ of a nation that is showing a transition toward ignoring the people it exists\
  \ to benefit. There is hope... but we MUST work hard for it.\n\nOur friends to the\
  \ east have lessons to teach us. Taiwan is only one example. South Korea recently\
  \ showed us that peaceful protest, and the collective strength of people's unity,\
  \ can drive out an unjust leader. We can do the same.\n\n-- \nEzra Brown\n631-307-8082\n\
