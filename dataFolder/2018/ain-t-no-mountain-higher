Text: "The sun was blinding me. I closed one eye trying to find with the other one\
  \ the end of the road. I couldn't see a thing. Should I go back or should I keep\
  \ going? Going back would mean safety and comfort. To keep going would mean fear,\
  \ insecurity and probable, failure. I gave up, turned back and left. \nA friend\
  \ of mine once quoted \"The art of love\" by Erich Fromm. It talks about love as\
  \ a way of art; where humans are presented as beings in need of love and to be loved,\
  \ where if deprived of it, they fall into darkness, solitude. But when we base this\
  \ analysis in the capitalist system we find a paradox. Such system isolates individuals\
  \ to assemble them into mechanical gears for \"productivity\" and consequently incapacitates\
  \ them of being able to love. The fear and anxiety provoked by not being able to\
  \ see anyone close enough, that was what pushed me forward. \n\nI felt the sand\
  \ below my sandals, I felt the sweat come down through my shirt, I was trying to\
  \ ignore my heartbeats speeding up by each second passed. I always try to keep surrounded\
  \ by people, to feel their warmth. Am I too afraid to be by myself? What should\
  \ I talk about? We fear to be different, hence why we are constantly looking for\
  \ someone else's warmth, to follow them, to be another sheep in the herd. Such thought\
  \ makes me walk faster. \n\nAt every step, I reflect, and more questions arise.\
  \ Then I remember that report I wrote a year ago. The idea came up from those two\
  \ young argentinias whose life was taken for travelling \"by themselves\", words\
  \ used by different media channels. The RAE states as \"By themself\" to the person\
  \ who has no companion. And as far as I know it wasn't one argentinian but two,\
  \ the only thing they lacked of was the presence of a man. That thought made me\
  \ step harder. \n\nThe fear of being woman is greater than what the other half of\
  \ the human species believes. We are victims of past stereotypes anchored in a society\
  \ that advances very slowly. An imaginary inferiority that responds to all women\u2019\
  s murders happened every single year. Such thought fueled my last steps close to\
  \ the top of the mountain. \n\nI took a deep breath, profoundly inhaling through\
  \ my nose and slowly exhaling through my mouth. I was tired, of being anohter sheep\
  \ in the herd. I could see the last steps, it was getting steeper and harder but\
  \ I was so close. For every step I took the rocks would push me two steps back.\
  \ I got on my knees and I started crawling up, and up, I grabbed that last rock\
  \ and l rised."
