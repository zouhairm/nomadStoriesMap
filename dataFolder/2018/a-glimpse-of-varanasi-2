Text: "The sky was grey, but bright. Beaten up trainers were my choice of footwear.\
  \ Fighting unseen rubbish and newspapers with bare flip flopped feet under opaque\
  \ puddles, a similar sensation to when you get a hair stuck in your teeth, didn\u2019\
  t appeal today. The air was heavy and my thin trousers were already stuck to the\
  \ beads of perspiration running down my legs. It didn\u2019t bother me - I was used\
  \ to this by now. I smiled at today's tall companion, another passing Western soul.\
  \ A glimmer of shared experience, to become faded memory of a distant place.\n\n\
  Picking our way through the filthy streets, frantic horns created atonal chaos.\
  \ Motorbikes carrying six passengers, squeaky rickshaws, goats, rusty cycles, taxis,\
  \ donkeys and carts all competed to navigate the pitted earth beneath our feet.\
  \ We reached a blockade. A yawning gap of crude concrete revealing guts of rubble\
  \ marooned in putrid water. The road had collapsed under the rage of the recent\
  \ monsoon storm. Of course. By evening, it would be fixed with reliable bark and\
  \ cardboard to even out the surface.\n\nFlies swarmed around sizzling pastry Momos.\
  \ Precarious limes towered, promising fresh lukewarm\njuice. A constant click of\
  \ unseen reels confirmed the indoor labours of thousands of fingers and silks. The\
  \ rich myriad of intertwined lives didn\u2019t calm down until a welcome clearing,\
  \ dwarfed by piles of logs for cremations; we had arrived at the Ghats.\n\nRelishing\
  \ the sacred open space, the pregnant grey Ganges calmly brushed past us as we meandered\n\
  alongside. Families grouped, bathing in the divine water. Rancid. Contaminated by\
  \ thousands\nof years of bodies and disease. Cremations glowed, docile cows nibbling\
  \ at orange and magenta\nflowers adorning the recent dead; peaceful, spiritual,\
  \ strange.\n\nA loud crash of plastic against flesh. A man with his arm raised demanded\
  \ attention, bottle in hand. A woman cowered beneath, covering her eyes. Hindi spat\
  \ at her. Her shoulders shook. He strode off, chest bloated with self-righteousness.\
  \ The visitors' tranquillity now broken by the harsh realisation that 'you can do\
  \ nothing\u2019, a shared understanding between shocked Westerners. The woman alone,\
  \ isolated, sobbing. Families carry on with their rituals. Nothing has happened.\
  \ Violence and injustice in the heart of this holy place. I remain shocked. She\
  \ remained humiliated. Culpable\u2026she deserved it\u2026it was her place. Jolted\
  \ with outrage, burdened with inherent helplessness, we walk on in silence, leaving\
  \ the guilt-ridden woman weeping alone."
