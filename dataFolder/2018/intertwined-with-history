Text: "Putting Louisville in my rear-view mirror, I began to settle back into the\
  \ solace and seclusion of the road. Getting further and further away from the city\
  \ atmosphere. 5 miles, 10 miles, 15, 20. \n\nThe city blocks turned into neighborhoods,\
  \ then the neighborhoods into fields. Until, finally, I reached the edge of the\
  \ county. A giant sign stood in front of me; \" You are now leaving Jefferson County\"\
  . On the edge of the sign, someone had slapped a Louisville sticker. \n\nStanding\
  \ there, staring at the sticker, I was overcome by a feeling. A poignant, overwhelming\
  \ sense that I was not yet supposed to leave Louisville. The forces of nature were\
  \ urging me back. I sat down next to the sign, shaking my head. Twenty miles out\
  \ of town, tired, I had very little interest in backtracking. But I knew I had to.\
  \ Louisville was undeniably calling me back. I didn't know why, but it was. So,\
  \ I turned around, trekking the twenty miles back into town, checking into one of\
  \ the local homeless shelters. There, I sat. I watched. I waited. \n\nTwo days later,\
  \ Muhammad Ali died. \n\nIt was an interesting time in Louisville. A historic time.\
  \ The passing of one of the most popular icons in modern history, born and bred\
  \ on their streets. Muhammad Ali meant a lot to the people of Louisville. \n\nSitting\
  \ in a community drop-in center the morning of his death, I watched the reactions.\
  \ The images of 60 and 70-year-old black men with tears quietly rolling down their\
  \ cheeks. \n\nThe day of his death, walking around the city, I felt disappointed\
  \ by the lack of fanfare. Sure, he had only just passed, but I had expected to see\
  \ some sort of visible tribute to recognize the loss. \n\nWith all eyes on Louisville,\
  \ I decided to take matters into my own hands and materialize the tribute myself.\
  \ I scoured the streets and gathered a collection of materials to construct a sign;\
  \ Scavenging a wooden stake, I constructed and adorned it with a large red cloth-glove\
  \ and a small rectangular sign under the glove reading RIP ALI. \n\nQuietly and\
  \ somberly, for 10 hours, I carried the sign around every street of downtown Louisville;\
  \ The city intermittently honking and cheering, raising their fists in the air,\
  \ taking the opportunity to let go of a little grief and mourn. \n\nAs the sun began\
  \ to lower, I took the sign to the namesake Ali Center downtown and stuck it in\
  \ the middle of a makeshift shrine of flowers that had begun to form. A fitting\
  \ place to leave it, I thought."
