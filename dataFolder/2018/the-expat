  \ \nIt wasn\u2019t a sarcastic question. The kids were starting to learn English\
  \ from scratch, although I had been already teaching them one or two months. I was\
  \ one of the three hundred volunteers teaching English in Ecuador. And we all agreed\
  \ in the same complaints: those kids never pay attention.\nI admit it: I am not\
  \ the most patient person in the world. In several occasions, I had to use a technique\
  \ to keep the children quite: I whistled. I\u2019m not proud of it, but it used\
  \ to work. I would stand, getting on my nerves, right about to shout. But instead,\
  \ I would form a circle with my thumb and middle finger, approach it inside my mouth,\
  \ over my bended tongue while swelling my chest. FIUUUU! Painful expressions, hands\
  \ covering ears, eyes staring to a strange teacher who would ask them: \u201CAre\
  \ you cattle or people?\u201D\nHowever, not everything was stressful. In the courtyard,\
  \ during the break, some kids would come to offer me some food, others hug me or\
  \ try to get me involved in some game. \u201CHola licenciado\u201D, they greeted\
  \ sometimes, sounding \u201Clisensiado\u201D due to the traditional Hispanic American\
  \ \u201Cseseo\u201D. \u201CLicenciado\u201D (which means \u201Cgraduate\u201D) is\
  \ how they normally call the teachers. Other times: \u201C\xA1Profesor teacher!\u201D\
  , no matter if the same word is repeated twice. Meanwhile, this accidental \u201C\
  profesor teacher\u201D would think in the weekend, in discovering the monkeys in\
  \ the Amazon, contemplating another huge cascade or perhaps running out of oxygen\
  \ while ascending the Chimborazo volcano. \nWhat would those students fantasize\
  \ with? Most of them lived in hard conditions, like the two girls whose mother wanted\
  \ me to give them private lessons. I had lunch once at their grey cement house from\
  \ the suburbs, which had the same aspect of unfinished building than the others.\
  \ As an exception, that day she cooked two dishes, while they normally eat just\
  \ one. I certainly wasn\u2019t the only one in need to let my imagination fly.\n\
  \u201CSo, does anybody remember the meaning of listen?\u201D, I repeated louder,\
  \ irritated. \nThere I was, still waiting for a miracle, with one hand pointing\
  \ at the board, my sight penetrating those little heads, as if I was using X-ray\
  \ to catch their thoughts. \nFinally, a girl answered: \u201C\xA1Licenciado!\u201D\
  \ \nThere was nothing else I could do for them that day. Luckily it was Friday.\
  \ After work, I went home, took my backpack and went to the bus station.\nBy the\
  \ way, \u201Cescuchar\u201D is the Spanish translation for \u201Clisten\u201D."
