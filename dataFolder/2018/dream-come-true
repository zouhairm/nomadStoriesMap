Text: This is the story of a girl from a small town with high aspiration in eyes.
  I always wanted to be bold, brave and self- dependent. With the due support of my
  parents, I have shifted to Surat, Gujarat for my further studies. To travel solo
  was my dream come true. it has taken almost 6 months to convince my parents. the
  journey started on 16th January 2018 from Surat. I reached Bangalore during the
  evening and went directly to the Art of Living International ashram. the place was
  next to heaven. the ambiance there, I cant put it into words. I registered for a
  course which completed by 21st evening. on 22 I came to Bangalore city. I met local
  people over there and got to know the lifestyle of the people of south India, explored
  the local places like Cubbon Park, ISCON Temple, snow world, UB city, Jawaharlal
  Nehru Planetarium, fun world and many more. the local foods over there tasted so
  different from north India.Then on 24th, I planned a trip to Mysore, where I left
  in morning by 6 a.m. in midway even had a stop over Srirangpatna where tipu sultan's
  fort is situated. by 12 I reached Mysore and had my lunch.then I covered all major
  spots like st. Philomena church, Mysore fort, zoo, Chamundi hills and Brindavan
  garden where the musical fountain was eye-catching. the same day I returned back
  to Bangalore late night and next day morning I left for Surat.
