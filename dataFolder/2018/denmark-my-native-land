Text: "She was staring at the night-coloured fields which stretched as far as the\
  \ eye can see, wondering where that sense of belonging came from. She had landed\
  \ in Billund airport almost two weeks before, to join other nineteen guys whom she\
  \ had already started to consider as family. She had applied to that cultural summer\
  \ camp because \u2013 it was hard to explain. \nIt was late. The sun had already\
  \ set, which meant that it was at least half past ten, considering that they had\
  \ been sitting by the campfire, roasting marshmallows and watching the sun that\
  \ slowly fell beyond the horizon during those White Nights \u2013 like. \nShe heard\
  \ some footsteps behind her but didn\u2019t turn, she knew it was him. Christian\
  \ sat on the cobblestone without thinking about it and gazed across the fields too.\
  \ \nAfter a while he broke that silver silence: - I would have never thought you\
  \ were the loner type.\nFinally she glanced at him and grin: - I would have never\
  \ thought you were the curious one.\nHe didn\u2019t answer, but he started: - Once\
  \ upon a time\u2026 And she laughed but sat next to him. He was a damn-good storyteller\
  \ and he alwasy had a sort of fairy tale air surrounding him. \nHe started telling\
  \ a story of his world, of his own land that he loved. It was a legend about Yggdrasill,\
  \ the World Tree. She had always had a passion for the Asgardian mythology. \n\u201C\
  The chief place or sanctuary of the gods was by the ash Yggdrasil. There, every\
  \ day, the gods had to held court. The ash was the greatest of all trees, its branches\
  \ spread out over the whole word and reached up over heaven. The tree was held in\
  \ position by three roots: one is among the \xC6sir, the second among the frost\
  \ ogres where once was Ginnungagap, and the third extends over Niflheim.\" \nHe\
  \ paused, noticing only now that other guys had reached them and sat silently to\
  \ listen to him. She gazed toward the fields again, as if some of those gods might\
  \ have appeared in the darkness in front of them. She felt at home. Even if they\
  \ were some thousands kilometres away from her hometown, she experienced a sense\
  \ of belonging. That sense of sweet, proud, biting loneliness that she had been\
  \ dealing with since she was a child, had gone. She was part of something, she was\
  \ a girl, she was a friend, she felt new. So, when the next night they gathered\
  \ in the warm hall with the dancing shadows cast by the flames in the fireplace,\
  \ and sang the english version of the danish national anthem, she smiled at the\
  \ words: \u201CDenmark, my native land\u201D, and meant them."
