Text: "When I went to Japan I was expecting to get to know a new culture, explore\
  \ the cities, try the cuisine and mostly, to have fun with my sisters in karaokes\
  \ and arcades. Which I did, but I was totally not expecting the change Japan would\
  \ bring to me.\n\nI started a journal and recorded videos about the trip. I was\
  \ fascinated (I still am) and got this feeling, almost an urge to never forget anything\
  \ about it. I knew I wanted to have something to remember this adventure when I\
  \ was 80 and somehow pictures & anecdotes were not enough anymore, not for this\
  \ trip at least. The funny thing is, I  have been lucky enough to have travelled\
  \ to some incredible places before. I've been in 3 different continents yet, no\
  \ other country made me want to not only take pictures and re-tell anecdotes, but\
  \ to write absolutely everything down and read them to myself. It was inevitable\
  \ to wonder what Japan had that other places didn't, what triggered the writing?\n\
  A friend of mine gave me a little notebook for my birthday and she said to use it,\
  \ because I see wonderful and interesting stuff and that way I would never forget.\
  \ I never did. While packing, I saw it and somehow knew I had to bring it along\
  \ for the ride. \nBeginning to write was such a complicated thing to do because\
  \ I didn't know how to start, I told myself: \"Make a list of things that you like,\
  \ it's a personal travel diary, nobody's going to read it\". I ended up writing\
  \ about the intoxicating feeling of being there, people's way of life, fashion,\
  \ food, a lot about how restaurants have wax figures of the menu as an exhibition,\
  \ a lot about everything and anything I saw in the stores (the fridge designed to\
  \ keep hot beverages warm. I told everyone I know about it) and there's about 3\
  \ pages dedicated about how in love I was with the toilets.\nPeople in Japan are\
  \ so incredibly kind and nice. Just seeing them made me feel like I was learning\
  \ a lot, because of course the Western and Occidental sides of the world, handle\
  \ things differently. I found myself researching about Shinto, fashion influences\
  \ and designers, beauty standards, behaviour manners, rituals, food, structural\
  \ architecture, entertainment. \nI was not expecting to start a travelling journal\
  \ in that trip (that I have continued to use) , to become passionate about writing,\
  \ or to becoming so addicted to research and learning about new places, people and\
  \ cultures. I was not expecting to find something that would make me feel intrigued,\
  \ interested and so alive."
