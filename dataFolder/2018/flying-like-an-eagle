Text: "It's 6:00 a.m. and Eric is incredibly full of energies: he already packed,\
  \ got dressed and is rushing now having breakfast, while I'm barely able to open\
  \ my eyes.\nWe have to leave early today: Pamukkale is waiting for us!\nOur journey\
  \ is long. \nThe road is full of curves and we start going up on the mountains.\n\
  Wherever we watch there are national flags. Sometimes we see dozens of them and\
  \ nothing else, other times we meet some men walking with donkeys carrying wood\
  \ and in other moments we pass through villages in which there are a few women covered\
  \ in their flowery shawls.\nEverything here is so different from our homelands.\n\
  I'm Italian and he is American. Two best friends discovering a country called Turkey.\n\
  While my mind is completely lost in these images, my mobile phone starts ringing.\n\
  It is Hakan asking me at what time we are going to reach Pamukkale.\nI met him through\
  \ a website for travelers and he kindly offered us to show around \" Better than\
  \ a local\", as he said, so we organize the meeting point in a small field next\
  \ to the main road that brings to the Hierapolis archeological site.\nHakan is waiting\
  \ for us. He smiles and tells:\" Are you ready to go paragliding with me over the\
  \ Pamukkale's pools?\"\nWe are not ready, but this sounds like one of those experiences\
  \ you cannot miss in your life. I push away the fear and after a few minutes I find\
  \ myself with an helmet on my head and a selfie stick in my hand while I'm running\
  \ with Hakan from the top of a mountain.\nThe wind is strong, I'm scared and amused\
  \ at the same time.\nI feel safe, as he told he is a professional paraglider, but\
  \ I never did something like that before.\nThe adrenaline mixes well with a great\
  \ sense of peace.\nBeing able to fly while watching the archeological site and the\
  \ natural pools from the sky is so beautiful I can barely describe it.\nFinally\
  \ I have an idea about what birds see while they are in the air!\nFrom the mountain\
  \ to the meeting point we fly less than ten minutes, but these seems hours and when\
  \ we start landing I really wish it could have lasted more, above all because the\
  \ idea of landing on cars driving on the main road is really scary.\nMy pilot is\
  \ a great one and living this experience with him allows me to do not get injured\
  \ and to be able telling this story now.\nMy legs tremble and I'm not even able\
  \ to stand up. I remain sat on the floor for a while with a huge smile on my face\
  \ and I keep on thanking my new friend for having made me live such an unforgettable\
  \ moment."
