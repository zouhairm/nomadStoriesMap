Text: "Tap tap tap. Hop. Shuffle. He was brilliant. Everyone on the floor was. The\
  \ men guided their partners with authority and flair, the women were elegant, confident,\
  \ all heartbreakingly beautiful. I watched enviously. This was Lavoe, the hottest\
  \ salsa club in town. I didn't even know what I was doing there. I couldn't dance.\
  \ Not one step. But I decided that was going to change. Ecuador would be where I\
  \ finally learned to dance.\n\nFrank wasn't the teacher I'd expected. I'd pictured\
  \ an old man, ponytail, maybe a husky voice from smoking too much. Frank was the\
  \ opposite; a young Afro-latino, with a smooth, artsy vibe. When I showed up for\
  \ my first class, he showed me straight to the studio and punched on the music.\n\
  \n\"This is Cuban salsa,\" he shouted, gliding in circles. \"And this, this is LA\
  \ style.\" He shuffled across the room, confident, suave. \"Rumba,\" he continued.\
  \ \"And this one, Son.\" On he went. I was mesmerised. It was so effortless, so\
  \ free, so cool. Then, a girl arrived. \n\n\"This is Camila, she will be your partner.\"\
  \ She was young, sandy blonde, with out-turned feet, like a ballet dancer. \n\n\
  Frank pulled us together. \"Ok, bailamos.\" \n\nFor the next hour, Frank drilled\
  \ the steps into my head. \"1, 2, 3. Pause on 4. And 5, 6, 7. Muy bien Brendan!\"\
  \ Just like that, my first lesson was over. I was inspired. All I wanted to do was\
  \ learn more. \n\n\"Can I book another class?\" I asked. Frank nodded. \"Of course.\
  \ When?\"\n\nI shrugged. \"Tomorrow?\"\n\nFor the next two months, I took salsa\
  \ class every day. Frank and I became friends, spending every day in the studio,\
  \ dancing, talking, laughing. Camila and I grew close, like brother and sister.\
  \ We spent endless nights together, laughing over music, telling each other our\
  \ secrets, exploring the salsa halls of Quito. They welcomed me in like family,\
  \ and I thought of them as nothing less. The studio became a second home. \n\nBut\
  \ 2 months flew. Soon enough, it was time to leave.\n\nOn my last night, Frank,\
  \ Camila and I returned to Lavoe, the same bar I'd been so inspired at before my\
  \ first class. I looked over at the stool where I'd sat just 2 months earlier, watching\
  \ the dancers with such envy. Salsa was intimidating back then, scary even. Now\
  \ it was something I just did it in my kitchen. I pointed at the stool and told\
  \ Camila about it all. She threw her head back, laughing.\n\n\"But why were you\
  \ so scared? It's only dancing.\" \n\nShe was right. It was only dancing. I smiled,\
  \ stood up, and pulled her to the dance floor. \n\n\"Bailamos.\""
