Text: "Barcelona in June. The Spanish sky was a clear azure over clean city streets.\
  \ We were there for Primavera Sound Festival, which had just come to a reluctant\
  \ finish, following several warm, blurry days of music, artistry and blessedly short\
  \ beer queues. With the festival over and six days left until our return to England,\
  \ we were not in the mood for simply lazing back and tanning all our time away.\
  \ We\u2019d rented a car that could just about squeeze the six of us in, if the\
  \ two in the back didn\u2019t mind riding with their knees in their ears. I\u2019\
  m only a little fellow, so it was no trouble for me. \n\nWe\u2019d found in our\
  \ pre-holiday research a scenic spot that we could drive out to: Cascada La Foradada.\
  \ The trip was a long one, and we stopped off for food in a little town north-east\
  \ of Barcelona, where we met a lovely little Catalonian woman, Maria, who served\
  \ us the most scrumptious patats bravas with aioli (we didn\u2019t trust our translation\
  \ skills enough to order anything more adventurous). She spoke very little English\
  \ and my Catalan was shaky at best, though she gave me the phrase \u201Cde res\u201D\
  \ and was giddy to learn its English counterpart, \u201Cyou\u2019re welcome\u201D\
  . We left her gleefully repeating it to herself. \n\nWeaving our way through verdurous\
  \ hills, we reached the closest parking spot that our map app could lead us to.\
  \ The trip down to the waterfall was steep, rocky, and had me feeling like an Alpine\
  \ ibex. Eagerly following the sounds of running water, I was the first to breathlessly\
  \ reach the oasis that is Cascada La Foradada! \n\nTucked snugly in the hills, with\
  \ the forest chirruping at your back and the high cliffs ahead, is a viridescent,\
  \ fish-filled pool fed by the thirty-or-so foot waterfall. Sunlight streams through\
  \ a wide opening in the rockface to the left and plays on the surface. It was to\
  \ this opening that I ran, skirting the water\u2019s edge and climbing up onto a\
  \ cliff shelf, right by the rush of the falls. \n\nAfter ten minutes of reflective\
  \ reclining, I heard a voice from above. There, thirty feet up, was a head poking\
  \ over the side of the cliff, making shooing motions at me to move out of the way.\
  \ I obliged, and a streaming length of red silk was let fall. Next thing, a stunning,\
  \ well-muscled Spaniard descends like some god from the heavens down the fabric\
  \ and proceeds to twist and contort into shapes that made my own puny abs ache.\
  \ I introduced myself. His name was Javier, a successful aerial artist, and I told\
  \ him that he was fantastico!"
