Text: "I had just turned 21, newly single, unemployed and feeling lost. \nI had money\
  \ in the bank and with a very spontaneous nature I booked a trip, not knowing what\
  \ to expect. I had been to Thailand once but with my family over four years ago.\
  \ \nTwo months later there I was alone and hot  in busy Bangkok. I know very little\
  \ Thai with the people I was staying knowing zero English it made life very difficult.\
  \ There I was alone, hot, and mute for two days. \nChiang Mai, Bangkoks slightly\
  \ less crazy younger sister. I enjoyed my time in Chiang Mai, I met some people\
  \ so I could finally have conversations. We went to elephant sanctuarys, night markets\
  \ and we ate a lot of  beautiful food. I felt as if my time would be wasted being\
  \ in a city for a long time. So after 2 days in Chiang Mai off to Pai we went. \
  \ \nI rode up to Pai with 3 friends I had made from Chilee, The ride was incredible,\
  \ with over 762 turn up a mountain it's quite dangerous if you haven't ridden a\
  \ scooter much before, for me it was something I felt like I had to do. You are\
  \ surrounded by Forrest, rolling farmland and stunning views, on that ride everything\
  \ finally made sense to me and my decision to be here. \nPai, no words or pictures\
  \ could ever describe the beauty that this town possesses. Waterfalls, Buddhas,\
  \ temples, canyons, caves, hot springs Pai has it all. I booked my accomodation\
  \ online, 150bt which in AUSD is $4.80 the cheapest I had stayed yet in Thailand\
  \ I wasn't expecting great things. I checked in, got taken to a grass hut, with\
  \ a double mattress,mosquito net and fan. It was perfect. I stayed at KK hut for\
  \ another 3 nights until my friends from Chilee left. Alone once again I checked\
  \ into a party hostel to meet some new people. Here I met 5 boisterous men 2 from\
  \ England and 3 Australians like me. The next 3 days I spent with them, exploring\
  \ waterfalls, watching the sunsets from the canyon and drinking a lot. \nI then\
  \ flew back to Bangkok then caught a bus to Krabi (Aonang) I had to see the islands.\
  \ \nI regret my decision of leaving Pai, AoNang beautiful yet busy, expensive and\
  \ everyone is less friendly I stayed for 3 nights not making one friend alone once\
  \ again. I decide to fly back to Chiang Mai, where I catch a bus back to the peaceful,\
  \ blissful, affordable, friendly, beautiful Pai. \nI did not expect to feel so connected\
  \ and so comfortable in a foreign place. I feel as though Pai is and forever will\
  \ be my home away from home."
