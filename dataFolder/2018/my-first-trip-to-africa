Text: "I never expected that on my first trip to Africa I would be a single mom traveling\
  \ with my nine year old daughter. We were headed to Senegal and Gambia with a group\
  \ of fourteen mothers and children to visit the village where our organization had\
  \ sponsored a well. \nThis was a dream come true to visit Africa and explore my\
  \ heritage while bonding with my daughter. Little did I expect that she would make\
  \ a new friend her own age and bond with her the entire trip.\nWe arrived in Dakar,\
  \ fascinated by this bustling capital city so vibrant with its bright yellow and\
  \ blue buses, colorful marquees, unending traffic and throngs of people. We were\
  \ staying at the Sofitel Teranga, a luxury hotel located in the heart of the business\
  \ district overlooking the Atlantic Ocean. The hotel staff was extremely accommodating\
  \ but took pity on us because we were women traveling alone without even an uncle\
  \ to protect us. Being pitied was the last thing I expected having been especially\
  \ proud of my independence and having the resources to travel.\nWe were welcomed\
  \ pool side with a dance that evoked traditional images of Africa; drummers and\
  \ dancers adorned in native attire, gyrating to the rhythms of the drums. But outside\
  \ we could have been in any major US city with high rises, skyscrapers and the IBM\
  \ building next door. The exception was the business women carrying briefcases,\
  \ poised in high heels, wearing tailored suits but expertly styled from the most\
  \ beautiful African textiles. It was last thing I\u2019d expected to feel that I\
  \ had literally seen the best dressed women in the world. \nOur trip to Goree Island\
  \ and The House of Slaves was the most startling. Walking through the cells in the\
  \ basement where thousands of my enslaved ancestors had been held in unbelievably\
  \ cramped quarters and seeing the shackles that bound them had a chilling effect.\
  \ The intensity of the soul crushing emotion I felt standing in the Door of No Return,\
  \ the last point of departure of my ancestors from Africa to America, was totally\
  \ unexpected.\nThere were many unexpected things during our trip; seeing a Martin\
  \ Luther King Boulevard sign, pink sand and cows on the beach in Gambia, having\
  \ custom clothing made overnight and meeting Alex Haley\u2019s aunt in Jufere, his\
  \ ancestral village. All of this was beautifully captured in a cherished photo album\
  \ full of lifetime memories. The last thing I expected was for my daughter to take\
  \ the album to school, leave it in her locker and have it thrown out the end of\
  \ the school year."
