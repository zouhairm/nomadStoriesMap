Text: "Nusa Penida whispers in the hot sun, glistening like a mossy jewel in a constellation\
  \ of Balinese islands. The crystal sea encrusts the jetty licked by plastic debris,\
  \ while from a totem swings a woven palm frond braided with feathers that tickle\
  \ the blue sky.\nThe archipelago of Indonesia spans across 17,000 islands, cultures\
  \ and ecologies that vary between each landmass. Nusa Penida is situated to the\
  \ east of Bali, but a National Park has seen it escape the mass developments of\
  \ the tourist hotspot. A mating ground for rare Bali sparrows, the jungle canopy\
  \ remains preserved alongside villages where shrines burn daily with incense, music\
  \ buzzes from ramshackle shops, and patchworks of seaweed farms stitch the bay.\n\
  I wonder how the trickle-down effect of development affects subsistence farmers\
  \ on Nusa Penida. My grasp of economics is shaky, but as a kilo of seaweed sells\
  \ for 5000 rupiah \u2013 the equivalent of 20 US cents \u2013 after being dried\
  \ and transported, a day\u2019s harvest would earn one dollar, perhaps. It seems\
  \ unfair that I buy cheap toothpaste made from kelp, while the cost of carbon mileage\
  \ and plastic waste hits those working on the land. My heart pre-emptively sinks\
  \ for the reefs lacing the shores - in my home country, rising temperatures have\
  \ given the Great Barrier Reef a death sentence.\nAs I approach the jetty, fear\
  \ holds me back from the water\u2019s edge \u2013 I was dropped in a dam as a toddler\
  \ and haven\u2019t quite shaken my phobia of swimming. But as the friendly locals\
  \ of Nusa Penida toil around me, their stoicism makes me feel brave. I strap on\
  \ a rubbery snorkel and frog-kick my way through the seaweed, watching the branches\
  \ sway peacefully in the water.\nWhat I see next utterly overtakes me.\nA brain-like\
  \ vortex of coral pulses greeny-pink in the sunlight. Bushes of crimped tubes and\
  \ nubs glow softly from rocky beds, edged by technicolour mosses and blossoms of\
  \ sea lettuce. A glint of a striped fish passes my hand, and following it I see\
  \ a lounging sea star, a gigantic khaki crab. There are tiny bulbs of jellyfish\
  \ suspended in shafts of green light. I dodge a floating Band-Aid, as a soft blue\
  \ groper weaves its way around the anchor of a lolling buoy. I had no idea there\
  \ was such bliss underneath the frothy grey surface of the water.\nI swim back to\
  \ shore and think, the thing that will save us from climate change is the same thing\
  \ that pushed me to the edge \u2013 the realisation of the beauty in the world,\
  \ that engenders a love more powerful than fear."
