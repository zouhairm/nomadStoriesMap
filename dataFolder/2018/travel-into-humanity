Text: "During twenty-seven years of my life, i was expecting many things about me,\
  \ about the others, all things that can make me reach what i called \u2018happiness\u2019\
  .But I have realized that even if I get what expect it makes me feel happy at the\
  \ beginning, but it is never permanent and we always goes from an emotion to another\
  \ one, a desire to another one.                                                We\
  \ evolved in an ambivalently way from sadness to happiness and we know that whatever\
  \ life is, finally we born to die. What I have realized is that when you born, you\
  \ don\u2019t know anything about your identity. Then we attribute you a name and\
  \ it\u2019s the first thing that makes you have your own identity. Then when you\
  \ are little child, you just act, you live the present freely. And you follow growing\
  \ up and your brand begins to get much information.Your family is the first place\
  \ where you learn about what is good, what is not good, what you have to believe\
  \ or no, and the most important we give you information about yourself but also\
  \ teachers, friends and it can be anyone.According to what they say, you create\
  \ an image of yourself.. And if you believe these words and you accept it  all your\
  \ life you will live with it thinking that they defined who you are.And during so\
  \ long time, you try to be the perfect person according to what the others want\
  \ you to be. So you finally wear different masks to be accepted. You live in front\
  \ of different opinions and as a mirror, you try to be the perfect reflect for each,\
  \ judging and blaming yourself if it is not \u2018enough good\u2019. Words can create\
  \ Paradise but also Hell thanks to propaganda, racial hatred, prejudices, wars,\
  \ fears, doubts, complex, culpability and many others negative effects. Peace of\
  \ mind is lost just because people trust opinions coming from others and makes it\
  \ a reality, make it their reality. And when you stop identify yourself according\
  \ to the others, you stop taking personally their words and you suffer less. And\
  \ whatever the cultural, religious, way of living, symbols, believes are human-being\
  \ is the same all around the world.Cultural Barriers cannot exist if words don\u2019\
  t have any meaning.Behind the mirror of words, you can see that we all are the same.So\
  \ for me it was my most important knowledge that I have learned since i become to\
  \ travel and more than making a local connection with people from any part of the\
  \ world, when you become \u2018The Real Yourself \u2018, you can create a real point\
  \ of connection with Humanity."
