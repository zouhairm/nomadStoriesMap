Text: "We had arrived at the oasis of Merzouga late at night when the desert was inky\
  \ black and frigid. It was so dark, we had almost missed the sign. When we woke\
  \ the next day, the blinding white vastness of the morning took us by surprise.\
  \ From the balcony outside our room, we could see camels being prepared for journey.\
  \ The sand dunes of Erg Chebbi rose in the distance, one peak standing far taller\
  \ than the rest. It didn\u2019t look very far.\n   We were on our honeymoon. First\
  \ time in Africa and enchanted by the enormous sky. Without much real thought, cameras\
  \ in hand, we started ambling towards the camels. After watching them for a bit,\
  \ we trudged along a bit further. Sand kept getting in our shoes but the dunes were\
  \ smooth and shimmery and entirely too much of a novelty to pass up on. I don\u2019\
  t know the exact moment when we turned our sights on the tall dune we had first\
  \ spotted from our balcony, but somewhere along the way we just started walking\
  \ towards it.\n   \u201CShould we go back to the room and get a bottle of water?\u201D\
  \ my husband asked at one point. An idea I easily dismissed as being too much of\
  \ a bother.\n   Over the next two hours I would have ample time to regret that decision.\
  \ Every clich\xE9 about deserts came to life as we trudged through the sand for\
  \ what felt like an eternity and tallest dune didn\u2019t get any closer. Even the\
  \ little black dot people seemed to be exactly where they were before! The soft\
  \ sand was hard to walk on after some time and climbing up the steadily rising dunes\
  \ required more stamina than we were prepared with in our pre-breakfast walk. And\
  \ to make it worse, we were bundled up in sweatshirts for the early morning chill\
  \ but the sun was now high in the sky and searing hot.\n   When we finally hauled\
  \ ourselves up to the top, we celebrated like we had climbed Everest. The view was\
  \ spectacular, the Sahara stretching endlessly away to the horizon. The wind kept\
  \ plastering my hair to my face. We saw no one at first sight and thought we were\
  \ alone till a voice called out from behind us. Startled, we turned to see a frail\
  \ old Moroccan man, dressed in white robes, half hidden by a small peak in the sand\
  \ waving at us. He was sitting cross-legged with a little mat in front of him. Laid\
  \ out on the mat was a meager collection of his wares.\n   \u201CBuy something?\
  \ Yes?\u201D he asked gesturing to what looked like a peppershaker. His smile was\
  \ wide and leathery. \n   We looked at each other and shrugged. We ended up buying\
  \ a stone soap dish to commemorate our climb."
