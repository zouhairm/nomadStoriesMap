Text: "And he kept telling me: - Baby don't hurt. Baby don't hurt.\n\nSome of the\
  \ few English words he knew which he picked up from some old American country songs.\
  \ He was teaching me Thai words to describe directions \u2013 right, left, and straight.\
  \ Sounded like fun, my pronunciation was good after a few repetitions, we were speaking\
  \ about the music he liked and how he learned a few English phrases from them. I\
  \ was tracking the route we were going on my phone and trying to navigate him to\
  \ my hostel, but at some point my intuition just screamed \u201CWait!!! This doesn\u2019\
  t seem the right place, the hostel is in a different part of Bangkok\u201D. I was\
  \ desperate. After nearly an hour I found out that we were going a wrong direction.\
  \ I don\u2019t remember precisely how all this happened, what I was searching on\
  \ the map and on the internet for. I just remember that a panic caught me. We had\
  \ been stuck in Bangkok traffic for more than an hour unable to find my hostel and\
  \ I had tears in my eyes. Exhausted physically but mainly mentally I tried to explain\
  \ to him to ask someone on the street to phone the number of my hostel, as my phone\
  \ battery was dying and we couldn't call from his phone. Then we found some people\
  \ on the street, somewhere in a very quiet part of Bangkok (try to imagine that)\
  \ and asking them to call the number of my hostel. Nobody was picking up the phone.\
  \ Then I told him the name of the part of the city where the hostel was supposed\
  \ to be \u2013 \u201CKhao San Road\u201D. Of course, at first, my pronunciation\
  \ caused some strange and misunderstanding expressions on his face but then he got\
  \ it!!! I felt a new hope again. It took us nearly another hour to get there in\
  \ a horrendous traffic but when we arrived I was absolutely relieved. \nThe funniest\
  \ and most desperate taxi driver I have ever met, trying to end up this before midnight\
  \ driving nightmare, but apparently at that time I had no idea what was waiting\
  \ for me in next couple of hours...\n\nThe trip to Thailand, the beautiful Raylai\
  \ beach and the city of Bangkok was supposed to cure my hurt soul. But at some point\
  \ it turned out to be \u201Ca survival camp\u201D, it felt like one at the moment,\
  \ the moment when I entered to the emergency room in Siriraj Hospital in Bangkok."
