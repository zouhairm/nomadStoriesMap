Text: "The motorbike sped down yet another meandering bend towards tierra caliente.\
  \ The heavy smell of coffee plants was intoxicating and a Willy Jeep overtook us,\
  \ loaded with empty coffee sacks and shirtless young men.  When we stopped at the\
  \ few traffic lights that littered the edge of the city, the equatorial sun warmed\
  \ us up and I smiled. \nI had met Cris a couple of months previously and what had\
  \ drawn me to him was his dancing. If I thought I loved dancing back at home, then\
  \ Colombia was a whole new level of pleasure and our European idea of dance and\
  \ rhythm was vastly different.  The range of different types of music (and therefore\
  \ dances) in Colombia is staggering: the ubiquitous sound of the accordion of vallenato;\
  \ the sultry tones of bachata; and the emotive crooning of ranchero - the music\
  \ of heart-ache. \nOne Colombian student told me, astonished, that in Britain, \u201C\
  The people dance separately.\u201D In Colombia, there was hardly a song that went\
  \ by without someone sweeping someone else out of their seat and into their arms.\
  \ Perhaps this is why Colombia, despite being one of the most unequal countries\
  \ in the world, is known as one of the happiest?  \nDancing certainly enabled me\
  \ to make local connections. A free fare from a bus driver came courtesy of a memory\
  \ of rafting one weekend in the R\xEDo Claro. Grated cheese on top of ice cream\
  \ had been followed by a late night dancing at the local salsoteca, until our feet\
  \ hurt and our heads ached for our pillows. The bus driver had remembered me from\
  \ our dance months before. \nMusic and dance are woven into the fabric of life and\
  \ love in Colombia.  One Saturday night, in an unfamiliar neighbourhood of Manizales,\
  \ we heard beautiful music drifting from an upper window down to the street. An\
  \ elderly woman welcomed us into a family home with, \u201CBien pueda!\u201D There\
  \ were two musicians singing classic Caldas music, complete with sombreros, guitar\
  \ and accordion. Neighbours of all ages sat together appreciating, enjoying the\
  \ simplicity of a Saturday night get-together. The woman who welcomed us poured\
  \ us shots of aguardiente and we grimaced as we downed the fiery liquid, while an\
  \ old man told of us courtships from long ago.  He reminisced, \u201CLife in Manizales\
  \ has always been wonderful!\u201D As I sat there absorbing the lightning-drenched\
  \ sky, I could not help but agree."
