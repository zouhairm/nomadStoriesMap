Text: "In a bleak, windswept, landscape in the shadow of a volcano, Makuri prison\
  \ can be found slowly succumbing to the elements. At the gate a makeshift sign warns\
  \ 'dangerous buildings,' a sure temptation for any keen explorer such as myself.\
  \ I approached the derelict complex with excitement, if not subtlety, as before\
  \ I had reached the fence the Maori landowner accosted me and demanded my motives.\
  \ I explained my unusual hobby to the comical character, who was dressed in ripped\
  \ clothes and using a golf club as a walking stick. He introduced himself as Beefy\
  \ and kindly welcomed me onto his land to explore the dilapidated buildings.\nA\
  \ large, oppressively silent courtyard is surrounded by four long cell blocks in\
  \ a shade of sad pink.  I entered the first block and stepped into a melancholy\
  \ and eerie world. The garish colour scheme contrasted with the smell of damp and\
  \ despair that emanated from the tiny, mouldy cells which once held captive imprisoned\
  \ souls. The roof had collapsed entirely, leaving a jumble of rotten wood, nails,\
  \ wire and light fittings which made it difficult to navigate down the corridor.\
  \ Shower and toilet blocks had been destroyed over the years. Almost every window\
  \ was smashed, and every valuable stripped from the buildings. 30 years of desertion\
  \ has taken its toll on Makuri prison. \nMoving on from the cell blocks revealed\
  \ the chapel, kitchen and other buildings of unidentifiable nature. As I was exploring,\
  \ Beefy reappeared, and launched into an account of his struggle to reclaim his\
  \ ancestral land from the crown (now complete with deserted prison).  It became\
  \ obvious that now the land was once again under his jurisdiction, he had his own\
  \ way of doing things around here. Trespassers, apparently, are often beaten with\
  \ the golf club, police told exactly where to shove it, and copious amounts of Marijuana\
  \ grown on site. He then proudly revealed himself to be a murderer and described\
  \ with great relish his own lawless brand of justice carried out against a despised\
  \ child molester. Beefy, it seems, refuses to live by the laws white men have imposed\
  \ on him, but by his own moral conduct. \nMakuri prison would surely be a haunting\
  \ location as you could find, but I survived the resident ghosts, dangerous buildings\
  \ and a murderer with a golf club to walk away with the satisfaction of having taken\
  \ some beautiful photographs, met a true eccentric and explored one of New Zealand\u2019\
  s most sinister abandoned locations. \nNames changed to protect identity."
