Text: "Saying it from the very beginning - I know geography! It is an important statement,\
  \ and soon you will understand, why. It was a hoot, and it happened to me. This\
  \ winter I went to Germany, Munich, to see that exact European Christmas that you\
  \ hear about \u2013 old fashioned, packed with Christmas markets, hot glen twine\
  \ and German pretzels. Important advice \u2013 never go to Germany to see Christmas\
  \ there! It is a family celebration, and you won\u2019t see anything of the above\
  \ listed! Come in a week before, you will get it all. So, I arrived at 25th of December\
  \ in the afternoon. By that moment all the decorations on central square were gone,\
  \ the same as Christmas market itself. No open shops or caf\xE9, only lots of Chinese\
  \ tourists roving around, looking for a place where to warm themselves up with a\
  \ cup of a hot wine. Everything is closed for the next 3 days. Frustrated, I called\
  \ my local friend, and she suggested for the next day to go to Saltsburg, where\
  \ I could see all of the things I wanted. I decided to take her advice. Next day\
  \ I woke up early and went to the train station.  There I got a little lost and\
  \ asked one nice German lady about where I can buy a ticket to Saltsburg. She also\
  \ told me what a beautiful place it is. Inspired, I approached ticket wending machine\
  \ and very soon became a proud owner of a ticket written \"Salzburg\" on it. That\u2019\
  s it, no more info. This fact is also important, but wait and see. \nI got coffee\
  \ and took my seat in the train. It was beautiful morning; I put my earphones on.\
  \ Winter landscapes were passing by. In Salzburg I went to the station souvenir\
  \ shop and the first thing I saw there, was a key holder with Mozart picture written\
  \ \u201CAustria\u201D on it. I was shocked to the extend I felt an urgent need to\
  \ leave the shop and check the other one, thinking it is a bad joke. The last thing\
  \ I expected was to find myself in a country that I didn\u2019t plan to be. I am\
  \ not crazy and I travel a lot, but such a funny situation happened to me for the\
  \ first time in my life. The thing is that I was travelling with a new passport\
  \ that doesn\u2019t require any visa while travelling around Europe, and not a one\
  \ person I talked to mentioned the name of a country I was going to. I also didn\u2019\
  t check any info before going there - so spontaneous was my decision. Salzburg is\
  \ a pretty famous place, but for some reason I never thought that day it could be\
  \ not Germany. But I had fun, saw beautiful Christmas market there and all the day\
  \ long was laughing about the situation."
