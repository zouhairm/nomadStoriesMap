Text: "A single tear dropped as I gazed back at the mountain. I can't recall when\
  \ Kilimanjaro made its way to my bucket list. It had always been there. An impulsive\
  \ decision overcame my doubt that I had the guts to attempt it. One day, I booked\
  \ a trip and it became real. Six months later, I stepped onto a tarmac under a darkened\
  \ sky and hot, floral air filled my nostrils. I knew in my bones I was somewhere\
  \ else. Africa. \n\n\"Welcome to my office,\" a booming voice said, \"I will take\
  \ you up the mountain.\" My guide, Naftal, would come to embody Tanzania for me.\
  \ The climb began on a bright Tuesday. So sunny, I put my baseball cap on to block\
  \ the glare. My \"group\" was only two hikers. And thirteen guides, porters and\
  \ cooks. The immensity of the undertaking hit and humbled me.  \n\nAs we took our\
  \ first steps of the six-day climb, porters hurried ahead with effortless speed\
  \ and strength. Watching them pass, wearing worn clothing, sandals and even dress\
  \ shoes, I assessed my costly hiking gear with shame. \"Rafiki,\" Naftal encouraged,\
  \ \"you will make it to the roof of Africa.\" He must have seen me looking at the\
  \ porters with awe.  \n\nEating dinner in our makeshift restaurant - a rickety table\
  \ with faded cloth, Naftal told stories of Tanzania. He taught us Swahili words\
  \ and phrases. \"I like your hat,\" he said one night, \"it would look good on me.\"\
  \ \"If you get me to the roof of Africa,\" I countered, \"it's yours.\" Our experiences\
  \ were worlds apart, but we united in shared moments.    \n\nThe push to the top\
  \ began on starless night. Each step in the dark inched us closer but brought more\
  \ cold and less oxygen. Naftal sang to keep us going, alternating American rap with\
  \ traditional Tanzanian songs. \"Pole, pole\" he reminded if we began to move too\
  \ quickly, \"the tortoise always bests the hare\". Seven hours came and went in\
  \ the blink of an eye. Magically, we were standing at the top, looking down on all\
  \ of the world. \"Congratulations\" said a sign, as if written to me. \"You are\
  \ now at Uhuru Peak; Wonder of Africa.\" And it was. The curvature of the earth\
  \ is visible. High-fives and hugs flowed. As we turned and took one final glance\
  \ at the horizon Naftal said, \"I will enjoy my new hat.\" \n\nCommon experiences\
  \ create connection. Shared meals. Conversation. Exposure to the elements. I went\
  \ to climb. I left with a friend. Naftal and I still keep in touch. Sometimes when\
  \ I open my social feed, I'll smile to myself as I see Naftal grinning from the\
  \ top of his mountain, wearing my hat."
