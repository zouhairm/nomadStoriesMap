Text: "I hate dogs. \n\nI've always hated dogs. \L\L\n\nSo when a friend\u2019s friend\
  \ asked if I wanted to dog and house-sit for her, my immediate reply was \u2018\
  NO chance!\u2019\n\nThen she threw a curveball \u2013 a Google Images link for \u2018\
  Guanajuato.\u2019 This triggered my self-diagnosed compulsive wanderlust disorder\
  \ (and unreasonable addiction to tacos) and my fingers found themselves frantically\
  \ replying \"YES ME!\"\n\nIt was beyond my control.\n\nRegardless, I was now faced\
  \ with the reality of a stranger\u2019s dog, in a foreign country, under my supervision\
  \ and responsibility.\n\nA half-week of self-pep talks and Tony Robbins clips helped\
  \ quell my nerves enough to reach out to a friend who happens to be a professional\
  \ dog-trainer. I asked him to draft a 'How to Love Dogs for People Who Hate Dogs\"\
  \ handbook, to which he begrudgingly obliged.\n\nI (think) I was ready.\n\nIf you\u2019\
  ve never heard of Guanajuato, upon first sight, your immediate reaction might be\
  \ a quaint Spanish town was airdropped smack dab in the middle of Mexico, then carpet-bombed\
  \ by millions of gallons of red, blue, orange, pink, purple and green happy!\n\n\
  Founded in 1558, this UNESCO World Heritage city has a rich mining history - at\
  \ its height, over two thirds of the world\u2019s silver came from the veins in\
  \ these very hills, and with mining, came money.\n\nAnd with money came ornate haciendas\
  \ scattered amongst seductive theatres, fountains, churches and museums.\n\nThe\
  \ colonial influence is inescapable, and with manicured tree-lined plazas dotted\
  \ with courtyard caf\xE9s surrounded by centuries old rainbow-colored sandstone\
  \ structures, conjoined by an endless matrix of cobblestone pathways, roadways and\
  \ alleyways, why would you want to?\n\nHowever, colonial influence eventually led\
  \ to inequality.\n\nAnd with inequality came revolution.\n\nAnd Guanajuato was ground\
  \ zero for revolution - it was here the first battle in the Mexican War for Independence\
  \ was fought.\n\nThough its prime mining days have waned, the region\u2019s draw\
  \ has not. The old mining tunnels are now an impressive network of roadways beneath\
  \ the city, leaving most of the aboveground for walking.\n\nIn fact, when you arrive\
  \ and lay eyes on her, the first, and only, thing you want to do is walk.\n\nEvery\
  \ vibrant path, plaza, twist and turn just leads to another insanely stunning all\
  \ of the above.\n\nNeedless to say, the last thing I expected was for a dog to be\
  \ my local connection to push me over the edge leading to one of the most beautiful\
  \ destinations I\u2019ve ever been.\n\nOh, did I mention, I love dogs\u2026"
