Text: "Daytime Nairobi is a mire of noise and chaos, enveloped in either a cloying\
  \ kind of heat or a bracing cold that seems to throb with a feint malevolence. It\
  \ is January and with that comes dry heat and dusty air. Haile Selassie Avenue is\
  \ the usual logjam of traffic, mostly caused by matatus, the ubiquitous coloured\
  \ vans that move the city. The noise is a strangely soothing jumble of local music\
  \ thumping from massive speakers in colourful buses, frustrated hooting and the\
  \ chatter of people streaming around me.\n\nI am Nairobi, all life and laughter,\
  \ but a soul that seems to float untethered from me. I am efficiency and speed,\
  \ I am not sentimental. I find the problem and fix it, I do not dally or fret. But,\
  \ I am alone. It\u2019s strange, in this swarm of people flowing around me, to sense\
  \ this. \n\nI am almost at the Railway Station, palms sweaty because of the nervous\
  \ excitement that is swirling inside me. My backpack is not heavy, but this is Nairobi\
  \ so I have wrapped it around me as tight as I possibly can, I look like I am about\
  \ to jump off a plane. The thoroughfare to the main entrance to the station is a\
  \ chaos of people and vehicles, from swarms of Chinese built taxi motorcycles known\
  \ as bodabodas to the hulking, 48-seater buses that ply the routes between the city\u2019\
  s populous Eastlands and the city centre, brightly painted with the faces of musicians\
  \ and rippling with the bass from the speakers hidden under the back seats. My ticket\
  \ is pre-booked, so I look around for something to occupy me in the thirty minutes\
  \ I have before the train pulls away for the Coast. I make for the concession stand\
  \ with a spring in my step, when I bump into a girl, who looked about my age, but\
  \ svelte, with a carefree air about her. I am about to make a fuss when she smiles\
  \ at me. \n\n\u201CSo sorry about that! Hi, I\u2019m Kielsa.\u201D\n\u201CI\u2019\
  m Awuor...\u201D\n\u201CCan I buy you a juice?\u201D\nI hesitate, but look again\
  \ at the caramel coloured face framed perfectly by her short, brown kinky hair that\
  \ traps the sunlight like a halo, complimenting her twinkling eyes. She has that\
  \ aura of playful joy that Nairobi embodies on its good days, a rampant pleasure\
  \ in the collective. \n\n\u201CYou going to Mombasa?\u201D I ask, surprised at my\
  \ pluck.\n\u201CI am! You too?\u201D She beams at me. \n\u201CThen let\u2019s sit\
  \ together. That\u2019s how you can repay me. Tell me, what\u2019s your story?\u201D\
  \ She beams wider, her impish face lighting up as she orders two bottles of cold\
  \ sugar cane juice, ready to tell a tale long enough to last through this four hour\
  \ train ride."
