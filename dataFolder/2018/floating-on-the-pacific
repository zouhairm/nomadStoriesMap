Text: "I had arrived to Tahiti, French Polynesia, completely plan-less. I had even\
  \ slept on a bench in front of the airport because it was too late at night to book\
  \ a hostel.\nI had this vague idea of heading to Bora Bora to find a job, which\
  \ sounded like a dream plan, yet something stopped me from booking any further journey\
  \ tickets from Tahiti. 'Step by step', I thought to myself, something might surprise\
  \ me on the way.\nTo my not so great surprise, my idea of a plan did indeed shift\
  \ entirely. \nAfter meeting Patricia, my sweet upper-bunk roommate at the hostel\
  \ I ended up booking, we came up with an amazing idea. We decided to go to the nearby\
  \ marina. We decided that we were going to explore French Polynesia through the\
  \ ocean. We didn't have money to board a cruise ship, and besides that wasn't our\
  \ kind of thing, so we decided to find a private boat in search of a crew. It wasn't\
  \ a tough task! Fast enough we found a retired man who was planning to escape the\
  \ approaching cyclone season by sailing up to the Marquesas islands - the furthest\
  \ away islands in French Polynesia (who also happen to stay out of the cyclone zone).\
  \ He was searching for company mainly in order not to do the tricky journey on his\
  \ own. \nAnd so there I was, a few days later - Yuval, a 22 years old baby who has\
  \ just recently left home, my comfortable zone,  now living on a yacht with two\
  \ new friends of 61 years old, about to embark on a brand new adventure. \nWhat\
  \ an incredible adventure it was ! We made our way to the Marquesas through a few\
  \ dreamy islands on the way, learning how to navigate, meeting locals and discovering\
  \ a brand new culture and lifestyle.\nLife on the sea is different from the one\
  \ on land. Time does't move from hour to hour, but from weather to mood. We live\
  \ by the wind, the waves and the currents, plan by the tides and follow the sun\
  \ or the moon. We would also swim daily in crystal clear waters among so many colorful\
  \ fish, sharks, manta rays, dolphins and whales. Our new companions...\nI had spent\
  \ 2 months aboard that sailboat, learning and growing, and had such a surreal experience\
  \ that even now, over 2 years later, I sometimes find it hard to believe it had\
  \ even happened. It was like living a Dream with a capital D.\nWhat a great thing\
  \ it is to travel without an agenda - so many opportunities pop your way and you\
  \ are absolutely free to flow with whichever one you're most keen on!\n\nFrench\
  \ Polynesia became a dear friend of mine, and I can't wait to go back again someday."
