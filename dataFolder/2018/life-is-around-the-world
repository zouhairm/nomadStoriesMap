Text: I leave Italy to find myself, again. It isn't the first time that I have to
  go, change place, job, people...starting a new life. I've decided to take a boat,
  a big catamaran, and travel across the atlantic oceans only to see the carribean
  country.  Two months later I'm just arrived there and start to enjoy my new experience.
  At the beginning i've try to work on a boat, I saw all the grenadine's Island, Union,
  Bequia, S. Lucia, S. Vincent, and finally i've meet some strange people. After that
  I find a job on the heart in a beautiful and funny tipical restaurant, hotel, disco
  bar in Martinica. I've met a lot of new friends, staring a new job in the kitchen
  like a "little chef" and found a new special person who make me happy for a few
  days. I'm learning the french language and somethimes I speek english too. I hope
  to continue my trip after the seasons to visit other beautiful country. Maybe I
  will try to write a book, i've start to write  a diary  when I've decided to leave
  Italy... three months ago. I thing it' s a beautiful experience for me, to learn
  more and more of ours "Magnifique monde" where we live. The weather, the rain, the
  sunset... all is magic here. I hope to visit la Guadalupe too, and continue to travel
  around the world. Bon voyage ....
