Text: "By the time we drifted away from the lodge, we had already spent forty-eight\
  \ hours in the middle of nowhere. \_Entering the Amazon had been like stepping into\
  \ a brand new world. A place out of the imaginary where some of my greatest dreams\
  \ - and fears - came true at once ! \n\nFrom the largest insects to infamous snakes\
  \ and dreadful piranhas, we had already seen quite a few scary animals. Yet the\
  \ excitement of further exploring this uncharted territory was stronger than my\
  \ fear of spiders. So when the guides offered to the less faint-hearted to dive\
  \ deeper into the jungle for a two-day camping trip, I did not think about it twice.\n\
  \nIt would be a euphemism to say I never had much of a passion for hunting. Yet\
  \ I had heard one of our guides was an expert in this field. Curious by nature and\
  \ excited by the outlook of discovering the native lifestyle, I suggested he took\
  \ his rifle for our expedition. He happily did so !\n\nUnder the pouring rain, we\
  \ had managed to set the camp. The night would surely be a rather uncomfortable\
  \ one, deprived from hot water and the protection of four walls and a roof. But\
  \ there was no time to start whining about such trivial inconveniences. It was now\
  \ time to fetch some fresh food ! We packed a few things and embarked on our canoe\
  \ again.\n\nA few hours later we had caught enough fish to cook a proper dinner.\n\
  We decided to head back to the camp.\n\nThe sky was pitch black and apart from some\
  \ glowy pairs of eyes there was barely anything to be seen.\nOur canoe was floating\
  \ gently on The Amazon.\nThe night was beautiful, lulled by the echos of some birds\
  \ singing.\nSuch a serene moment in a fascinating nature.\nSerene\u2026 until our\
  \ guide stood up in a heartbeat, aim at the distance and fired.\nThe noise torn\
  \ the night apart.\nThe canoe speeded to the shore. The guide disappeared into the\
  \ bushes with his weapon and a torch, not uttering a single word. When he reappeared\
  \ minutes later, a massive mammal in his hand and the happiest smile on his face,\
  \ I understood where his nickname had come from : Bala (aka The Bullet in English).\n\
  Hell of a shooter indeed !\n\nOur exploration of the jungle lasted another few days.\n\
  Days of constant amazement as Bala showed us his magic kingdom with the most genuine\
  \ and touching generosity.\nBut also days of absolute bliss as I reconnected with\
  \ myself ; a more complete version of me, excited as mostly a kid can be about catching\
  \ weird animals, lighting fires, climbing trees and gazing at the stars."
