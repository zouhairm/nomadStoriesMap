Text: "(Somewhere in Sri Lanka)  \u201CHello? Is this \u201CSandra Guesthouse\u201D\
  ? Please help! There\u2019s this guy- he\u2019s trying to take us\u2026We\u2019\
  re close- I can\u2019t hear you, it\u2019s too loud.\u201D Sounds scary? Well, to\
  \ explain how I got into and out of this situation in August 2017 I have to start\
  \ earlier: Just before I went for one year to Mexico I met Klemens. We had only\
  \ seen each other once, but stayed in contact and decided to travel to Sri Lanka.\
  \ Our second meeting was at the airport. When we arrived in Colombo we decided to\
  \ take the bus to our first destination Dambulla- a five hour ride. A busride in\
  \ Sri Lanka isn\u2019t the same as in Germany: It was packed with people, around\
  \ us symbols we didn\u2019t understand and everyone were staring at the tall blonde\
  \ strangers with those huge blue backpacks. Luckily we found a seat and I got sandwiched\
  \ between Klemens and a Sri Lankan. After a while the young man started talking\
  \ to me. He spoke only little English, so we communicated for almost 40 minutes\
  \ with gestures. He taught me how to count in his language and soon I introduced\
  \ my friend to him. He invited us to have lunch with him, he said his mother would\
  \ cook a special dish for us and he could give us a ride with his own Tuk-Tuk- those\
  \ three-wheelers you find in Asian countries. While Klemens was excited about the\
  \ offer, I remained suspicious - I had learned a lot about safety in Mexico. But\
  \ seeing my friends\u2019 joy and having heard about the Sri-Lankan hospitality\
  \ I agreed. We got off the bus and followed the man through stuffed streets. I had\
  \ a weird feeling but blamed it on my jetlag. When we arrived at his vehicle another\
  \ man was sitting inside: \u201CNo worries, he\u2019s just guarding the Tuk-Tuk.\u201D\
  \ They told us to put our baggage down. Then several things happened simultaneously:\
  \ A car stopped next to us and the driver waved at us, someone shouted something\
  \ and I decided to call the hostal to ask for help. I couldn\u2019t understand a\
  \ word and hung up. Klemens came over: \u201CThe driver told me to be very careful\
  \ with this guy! What should we do?\u201D His eyes reflected my own feelings of\
  \ insecurity. I\u2019m not sure how we got out of the situation, but I remember\
  \ me saying: \u201CWe have to go, the hostal manager is waiting for us!\u201D Ignoring\
  \ his protest we left. A safe distance away did I start to laugh: \u201CWhat a local\
  \ connection!\u201D Later on we got invited again by a Sri Lankan. This time we\
  \ had a wonderful experience. But to this day I still wonder whether there had been\
  \ a Sri Lankan lady waiting for us with lunch."
