Text: "It was a torrid August afternoon. My friends were planning a pool party and\
  \ they\u2019d been spamming me with texts all day. I loved the idea, but I wasn\u2019\
  t really in the mood. I was waiting for an e-mail that would have changed my life\
  \ forever, for better or for worse. \nNearly a month left to the semester\u2019\
  \ beginning and still I had no news. But the worst was: I didn\u2019t have a plan\
  \ B. I needed my plan A to work.\nI was sitting in my veranda, trying to read. Journey\
  \ to Portugal by Jos\xE9 Saramago. Suddenly, my phone screen lit back on for the\
  \ hundredth time. E-mail notification. From Doctor Peter Arnds, course coordinator\
  \ for the MPhil in Comparative Literature at Trinity College Dublin. Time stopped.\
  \ The clearest thing I remember of the following seconds is the heavy thuds of my\
  \ heartbeat echoing into my head. The message was loading. Slowly. Where I\u2019\
  m from, everything it\u2019s caught in this sort of timeless black hole, Internet\
  \ connection included. I blinked. There it was. \u201CDear student, it\u2019s a\
  \ pleasure to welcome you in our Postgraduate programme...\u201D\nI made it. I\u2019\
  d been dreaming for this moment since I first read Fairy and folktales of Ireland\
  \ when I was 8. Thirteen years later I was finally leaving Italy for Dublin. To\
  \ live there.\nI arrived in the Irish capital on a chilly morning. I was kind of\
  \ early, but I needed time to settle down. I was terrified. I felt so little. Faraway\
  \ from everything I knew. Barely understanding the people around me. The second\
  \ night I cried me to sleep. I swore to myself that, after graduation, I\u2019d\
  \ have never left Italy again. I kept repeating myself I\u2019d been crazy, stubborn,\
  \ unreasonable. \nThe next morning, I left my hostel early, armed with a tiny map:\
  \ I had to see a room in a student house. I got lost. It\u2019s not hard for me\
  \ honestly, but I just got distracted. Everything was so warm. The air smelled like\
  \ fried fish and wet nature. All the roofs were mint green and the flowers were\
  \ so incredibly bright. I kept on going around for a while when a man stopped me.\
  \ He was in his sixties, wearing an orange rust blazer. He asked me where I was\
  \ heading. I gave him the address and he left me on the front door. \u2013 Welcome\
  \ to Ireland. \u2013 he said. \u2013 Trust me, it\u2019ll get under your skin. \u2013\
  \nNo truer words were ever spoken. Ireland had been a real passion for me since\
  \ I was a kid and I always knew it\u2019d have been one of the best experiences\
  \ in my life, but I'd never expected it would have felt like home. In that exact\
  \ moment, it did. And it still does."
