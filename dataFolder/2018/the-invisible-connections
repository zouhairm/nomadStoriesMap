Text: "In this world today many people report, \"...I am more connected than I have\
  \ ever been.\" I guess in a sense we have the ability to connect in ways we have\
  \ never before: we can call most places with out qualm, we can see a face we haven't\
  \ seen in years thanks to Skype/Facetime, connect via email or even the lost art\
  \ of letter writing. Even so, to me this is not real connection.\n\nReal connection\
  \ is building an understanding through experience and memories. Can you remember\
  \ the most amazing visit you have via phone, Facebook or other social media? Doubtful.\
  \ We are a social creature, however, we still need to raw and unfiltered experience\
  \ together. This leads to real connection which fosters a sense of connectedness\
  \ which knows no bounds. In a sense we crave this experience. \n\nWe live in a world\
  \ where life can pass us by so easily in a state of dumbfounded sensory overload\
  \ without actually finding what makes us happy. Our happiness lies not in things\
  \ but in our every day lives and the ability to share a moment with someone. My\
  \ travel story brings you right along side myself and the amazing people I meet.\
  \ Not every has the means to travel or the ability to travel, however, my goal is\
  \ to transport you to the moments of true bliss. Follow me as I show how easily\
  \ it is to re-connect to a world which we slip farther from every day and find true\
  \ happiness in experience."
