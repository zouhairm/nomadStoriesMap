Text: "In December 2017, I and one of my colleague had to visit Yerevan, Armenia on\
  \ an official trip. After a long journey we reached Yerevan airport at 1.30 AM local\
  \ time. I was already in a half sleep stage. That time landing on a new land, between\
  \ different species of human beings, speaking a different language was quite irritating.\
  \ Language was a problem there. Even the government officials could not understand\
  \ English properly. I had to buy some local currency and then complete my VISA formalities.\
  \ I was expecting that the whole process will take atleast 2-3 hours more. Any way\
  \ I got the currency change and was little happy to have completed all formalities\
  \ in less than expected time, but was feeling very tired. After collecting the baggage\
  \ we headed to the exit gate. \nSince we went to Yerevan to visit the office of\
  \ some Indian company, so I was expecting some Indian Driver/ company staff on the\
  \ gate. To my surprise our names were blinking on a LED screen, and I said \u2018\
  what a welcome\u2019. Just after that my eyes fell on a snow coloured, glowing face\
  \ with big bright eyes; a tall girl holding a paging board with our names written\
  \ on it. She started smiling and laughing and at that moment my whole body fainted;\
  \ and I was totally gone. I hardly managed to hold my legs otherwise I would have\
  \ fallen on the ground. I don\u2019t know whether I was conscious or not, whether\
  \ I was walking or standstill, whether I was breathing or not, I was totally out\
  \ of my senses. I had no idea that such a beautiful girl would be waiting for our\
  \ welcome. I could never imagine that such beauty can ever exist. For me the whole\
  \ environment had gone dark and in that darkness I could see two big eyes, a white\
  \ face, beautiful black hairs, and a smile that took my breath away.\nAfter some\
  \ time I heard somebody calling me, it was my colleague. By that moment the girl\
  \ disappeared as if she was never there. Later on my colleague informed me that\
  \ the girl came to hug me as a welcome and I was like\u2026.what!! It was really\
  \ disheartening. I wish atleast I could say her a last good bye\u2026!"
