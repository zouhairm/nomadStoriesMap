Text: "Upon arriving by ferry from St.Thomas, we headed East in our rented jeep to\
  \ cross the steep, wildly curvy roads of St.John. For better or worse, I didn\u2019\
  t delve too deeply into researching this destination beyond logistical necessities,\
  \ as I like to live the surprise of discovery.\n As we neared our lodging at the\
  \ Concordia Eco-Resort we exited the moist, high elevation forest and entered a\
  \ surprisingly arid zone of spiny plants framing the turquoise waters. It was a\
  \ beautiful surprise I did not expect.\n Once arrived at our destination, we navigated\
  \ the elevated, sun-bleached, wooden walkways to our eco-cabin. It was also raised,\
  \ and of a simple wooden\nstructure, but wrapped in a durable fabric material with\
  \ zippered screen windows, a solar shower, and of-course breathtaking views in every\
  \ direction. We took in the romantically rustic, simple beauty of this \u201Ccabin\u201D\
  \ as the sun set and we made ourselves at home.\n Once settled, the wind gently\
  \ reminded us we were in a tarped, wooden framed structure. It was like being in\
  \ a rigidly structured tent, as close to being outside as you could be while sheltered.\
  \ It was perfect. Outside, another surprise, to the South, the most shooting stars\
  \ I have ever seen in one sitting, while to the North, lightening shot over what\
  \ I know now to be the British Island of Virgin Gorda. It was simply awesome. I\
  \ regretted blinking.\n Eventually the wind subsided, introducing a mysterious new\
  \ sound, from beneath the cabin. I, armed with a headlamp and a PB&J sandwich in\
  \ hand, was prepared to explore the dark island space beneath the cabin. Here, I\
  \ was met by the crawling, rustling of hundreds of points of contact from the ground.\
  \ The ground was completely overrun with Hermit Crabs, easily five or six per foot\
  \ in every direction. They were, as a unified group, aware of me and recoiled slightly\
  \ to my every movement, raising their dominant claws, brandishing their weapons\
  \ at me like a tiny army. It was a fascinating experience of both sight and sound.\
  \ I was captivated for some time by the procession of these creatures and their\
  \ passing threat display, while they marched by with all their eyes focused on me.\n\
  \ I then realized I had essentially just stepped foot here and this was day one\
  \ of nine. So off to bed, to the sound of the wind gently testing the structure,\
  \ the ocean lapping at the shore just below, and the crabs fighting over my PB&J\
  \ crumbs en-route to their midnight destination. A magic introduction I couldn\u2019\
  t wait to build on."
