Text: "Two things surprised me that cold December night in Barcelona. Firstly, I wasn\u2019\
  t as comfortable with heights as I thought.  Even one story up.  Secondly, how inconspicuous\
  \ we were entering an apartment directly from the street.  This wasn\u2019t any\
  \ old street either.  Nestled between Las Ramblas and the Catalan State Library\
  \ in the heart of the historic Raval in Barcelona\u2019s Old City. My two neighbours\
  \ and I were reacting to the latest instance of an issue which blights the neighbourhood\
  \ \u2013 narcotic gangs occupying vacant apartments.  With ladders, nails and spare\
  \ wood, we secured the empty apartment in our small building to deter potential\
  \ intruders.  Back on ground level, we exchanged satisfied smiles.  Relief and nervous\
  \ excitement took over as my eyes fixed on the corner of Las Ramblas,  waiting for\
  \ the appearance of the special girl who had forever connected me to this city.\
  \  \nWith the upcoming illegal referendum on Catalan independence due on October\
  \ 1, July 2017 was an exciting time to arrive in the seedy yet contemporary cool\
  \ Raval.  I intended to milk every aspect of life by getting to know local people,\
  \ make lasting memories, become fluent in Spanish and learn Catalan. However, months\
  \ passed and I didn\u2019t make much progress on my goals.  Life as it often does,\
  \ just got in the way.  \nThe weeks and months were characterised by events leading\
  \ up to the referendum.   The streets were peppered with balconies parading nationalism,\
  \ either promoting the dawn of a new state or maintaining the status quo.   This\
  \ referendum headlines, demonstrations, surveillance helicopters and widespread\
  \ media coverage provided the soundtrack to life.  Despite 2000 years of history\
  \ in the Old City, only the future referendum mattered.  \nOctober 1 arrived and\
  \ with it uncertainty, hope, fear and a tinge of excitement.  As the world\u2019\
  s social media focused on Barcelona, I had a sense something big was about to happen.\
  \  \nWith little notice, it was the early hours of October 2 that I met Alba for\
  \ the first time.   It seemed like horrible timing, however my next four months\
  \ revolved around spending as much time with her as possible.  She gave me my happiest\
  \ memories of Barcelona.  Through her I became fluent in Spanish, learnt some useful\
  \ Catalan and met some truly amazing people, none more so however than herself.\
  \  \nAlba was born only 780g and arrived over 14 weeks premature.  Just in time\
  \ for Christmas, she arrived healthy and happy to a proud family and safe Raval\
  \ home."
