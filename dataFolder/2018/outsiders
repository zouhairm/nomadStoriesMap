Text: "I landed in Bolivia, completely out of my comfort zone. I entered the home\
  \ and to my surprise, I found that my host family had a maid. Her name was Marina.\
  \ She was sweet and greeted me with a shy nod. Her clothing covered most of her\
  \ skin. She wore a grey long skirt that covered her ample belly, a dark blue sweater\
  \ that seemed odd on such a warm day and a stained apron. Around her shoulders a\
  \ multi colored traditional shawl that stood out among her bland clothing. Her face\
  \ was dark, round and wrinkled. Her long hair, chocolate brown, fell in two braids\
  \ down her back.\n\nI woke my first morning and made my way to the kitchen. I attentively\
  \ entered to find Marina busy with her cleaning. I awkwardly wished her a good morning\
  \ with my poor Spanish. She asked me something I couldn\u2019t understand. I tilted\
  \ my head with a confused expression. Her voice was sweet and high pitched but she\
  \ seemed to be speaking just a tone too loud for our close encounter. Her spirit\
  \ seemed young but her body looked aged. She shuffled across the kitchen, her long\
  \ skirt swaying. She opened the cupboard for me and pointed at the cereal. I smiled\
  \ and made a small noise in appreciation. I poured my cereal and when I spent too\
  \ long looking for the milk she came to help me again. I was grateful for her help\
  \ until she picked up my bowl and put it in the microwave. I had never microwaved\
  \ my cereal before so I was skeptical at the idea. She gave me an encouraging nod\
  \ and I replied with an uncertain smile. \n\nWhen she smiled, kindness emanated\
  \ from her deep dark eyes, laugh lines, and crooked teeth. I could tell she was\
  \ trying to make me feel welcome. Over the next few months I noticed her body language\
  \ with the family was shy, nervous, and she would rarely make eye contact. I found\
  \ myself smiling back at her regularly with the same emanating kindness she had\
  \ shown me. We only ever exchanged a few words but we would share warm and comforting\
  \ smiles with each other daily. I realized that despite our vastly different backgrounds\
  \ we were both outsiders in this home and despite the language barrier we still\
  \ shared a special connection. On my last day, now with greater Spanish skills,\
  \ Marina expressed to me how sad she was that I was leaving. By her expressed sorrow\
  \ of my departure I realized that our unspoken relationship, full of kindness and\
  \ warmth, meant as much to her as it had to me."
