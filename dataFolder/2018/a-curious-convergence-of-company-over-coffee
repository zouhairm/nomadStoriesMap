Text: "Never could I have predicted the events which ensued from a chance encounter\
  \ on a cable car in Tirana, Albania. I had chosen to ride a cable car to Dajti Mountainn\
  \ near the city and ended up in a car with a couple and an older man. \u201CHello,\u201D\
  \ I offered, but from their silence it was apparent that they spoke no English.\
  \ The woman tried Italian.  \u201CGermania?\u201D she asked.\nI shook my head. \u201C\
  America.\u201D\n\u201COh, America!\u201D Her eyes opened wide. \u201CIo, Roza.\u201D\
  \ I am Roza. \u201CMarito \u2013 Burim,\u201D and next to her husband, \u201Cpadre.\u201D\
  \ \u201CKafe?\u201D she suggested. \nWe ascended up a narrow dirt lane towards a\
  \ restaurant nestled in the mountainside thicket. Our waiter became de facto translator\
  \ and relayed a surprising request: \u201CThese people would like to invite you\
  \ as a guest to their house.\u201D\nAlways pursuing ways to step into the shoes\
  \ of locals, I accepted.  We then drove to Roza\u2019s house, along dusty roads,\
  \ through a bumpy cemetery, and past a towering landfill.  \u201CJob,\u201D Roza\
  \ stated.  Every day she wore plastic gloves and boots to wade through the refuse\
  \ and collect metal fragments to sell.\nRoza\u2019s mother emerged first from the\
  \ house.  Her soft weathered face was browned from years of sun while tending to\
  \ the luscious front garden. \u201CArjan!\u201D she called to her son. Arjan appeared\
  \ in the doorway, a young man with close-cropped hair in a white tank and faded\
  \ jeans, looking disinterested in the situation.  \nWe sat in the garden for a cup\
  \ of Turkish coffee. Arjan leaned his plastic chair onto two legs and relaxed in\
  \ the evening air. A cigarette hung loosely from his lips, masking his face in a\
  \ haze of smoke. His mother waved about her hands in excitement, pointing to her\
  \ ring finger to suggest that we should marry. \u201CDon\u2019t worry, she\u2019\
  s crazy,\u201D Arjan said, laughing. Thank goodness, I had not come to find a husband!\
  \  \nThe women later led me upstairs to dress me in their most cherished dresses.\
  \ The first was for celebrations. A silky flowered blouse tucked into a heavy three-layered\
  \ skirt, while long blue stockings, a beaded belt, and a red and gold handkerchief\
  \ completed the look.  The second dress was more elaborately beaded, with a firmly\
  \ shaped bodice adorned in clear beads that shimmered even under the dull glow of\
  \ the bedroom light. This was a wedding dress, the same that Roza wore for her marriage\
  \ to Burim. Roza\u2019s mother beamed at the sight. Her smile lines radiated a loving\
  \ motherly glow at the sight of this stranger, turned guest, turned family friend\
  \ who had embraced for one night being Albanian."
