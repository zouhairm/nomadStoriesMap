Text: "The sun was still up and it was late in the evening. The smell of fresh coffee,\
  \ fried bakery and cigarettes filled the air. I arrived at one of the most expensive\
  \ airports in Europe, built for the 2004 Olympics to properly honour the city of\
  \ Gods. The country was now swallowed by a political, social and economic crisis.\
  \ Nearly 11 million people lived in a limbo of hope and defeat. In that scenario,\
  \ Greece welcomed me to a unique place in the Mediterranean. \n\n\u201CYamas koritizia\u201D\
  , he said when served us the raki on the table. The group next to us had their shots\
  \ and fishy mezedes too. We ate and drank accompanied by Eastern and Western rhythms\
  \ merged in a festive tune. It was in a summer night like that when I met him. \n\
  \nBig, white, perfect teeth and sensual rosy lips, his smile captivated me. A pair\
  \ of deep blue eyes revealed the vital human he was. I didn\u2019t speak Greek at\
  \ the time nor he English. \u201CMoromou\u201D, he called me the first night we\
  \ went out, \"my darling\". We started seeing each other, exploring life in a new\
  \ way for us. He owned the bar in front of my place. I had to work at night so I\
  \ was there every day whilst listening to the traditional strings of the Greek bouzouki.\
  \ \n\nI didn\u2019t realise how quickly we learnt to communicate with each other\
  \ only using a few words, our intuition and body language. Behind those big eyes\
  \ there was a young man, borned and grown up in Gaza. Khaled escaped from misery\
  \ and torture but left his family behind. Through drawings and words he explained\
  \ me his past and journey to Athens. \n\nThat summer evolved into bombs killing\
  \ innocent people and innocent people abandoning their homes in Gaza. \u201CWhich\
  \ brand is your eyeliner?\u201D, his mom asked me the night we Skyped for the first\
  \ time. Tears come down my face when I remember it. Desperate, thousands of their\
  \ neighbours managed to leave and paid a fortune to get on a boat to Europe, risking\
  \ their lives in the sea. \n\nOne night, Khaled came and sat next to me. \u201C\
  A friend of mine left with his wife and daughters. He is coming here tonight, alone.\u201D\
  \ That was the beginning of a series of friends who survived and stayed at Khaled\u2019\
  s 25sqm shared apartment for a few weeks. Some waited to be relocated, others decided\
  \ to leave and crossed the borders.\n\nWe were left with scabies, distressed hearts,\
  \ lost in a land that was not ours. The smell of baked bread and fresh kuluri reminded\
  \ me that life went on and there was hope for a better future. Overall, this is\
  \ what them, us and the Greek society wanted to."
