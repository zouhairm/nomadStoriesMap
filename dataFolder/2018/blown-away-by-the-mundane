Text: "Dodging holiday makers, we run through Copenhagen airport on a quest. The once\
  \ a day flight to Kangerlussaq. Ahead awaits a sparse land with no interconnecting\
  \ roads, where 56,000 people inhabit an area the size of Mexico. Qegertarsuatsiaat\
  \ and Ittoqqortoormiit only a few vowels but a few hundred miles apart. 80% icecap,\
  \ yet home to the Viking\u2019s longest standing joke, Eric the Red\u2019s marketing\
  \ ploy to name the land Greenland.\nI\u2019ve dreamt of this land for so long, yet\
  \ I'm awed by its normality. In Kangerlussaq, only a cluster of Lego houses, the\
  \ airport caf\xE9 serves a selection of fruit teas and stale fries. In the gift\
  \ shop, postcards lazily express tired adjectives to ultimately declare \u201CWish\
  \ you were here.\u201D \nOur next flight, destination Ilulissat, takes us closer\
  \ to the top of the world. We pass casual security, elsewhere long replaced by machines,\
  \ to board our 24 seater. Below, a dramatic coastline of rocky outcrops and cathedral\
  \ like icebergs for as far as the eye can see.\nI\u2019m humbled by the everyday\
  \ lives I see. The taxi driver with his tired cassette player and rattling bumper\
  \ drives to the airport on a road that goes no further. The little girl balancing\
  \ on the wall needs no translation when she slips, her face red with embarrassment.\n\
  On Sunday, the Sarfuk Ittuk nudges into port. Locals transport. As we glide effortlessly\
  \ seaward, we pass the time as our travelling companions do, with buoyant conversation,\
  \ hearty meals and games. We observe them as they watch us. A young woman interrupts\
  \ our game \u201CWhere are you from? What are you playing? Where are you going?\u201D\
  \ \nWe\u2019re heading to Nuuk, the colorful capital, but we\u2019re more fascinated\
  \ by this craggy coastline and who inhabits these lonely hamlets. Our new friend\
  \ and daughter are also making the 400 mile journey south. \u201CWe\u2019re going\
  \ shopping for pajamas, and to use the elevator.\u201D  With no elevators in Aqunnaaq\
  \ this\u2019ll be a first. \u201CAlso use the swimming pool.\u201D\nThe tannoy interrupts,\
  \ first in Greenlandic, then Danish, thirdly in English.  \"Whales on the port side.\"\
  \ Scrabble tiles flying, we grab the camera and go out to lean into the biting spray,\
  \ a flick of a tail tantalizing the amateur photographer.\nFilled with sea air,\
  \ the whales long passed, we head inside. Our new friend hasn't moved. \"Yes, humpbacks,\
  \ we see them all the time from our window, although I'm not really into nature.\
  \ I prefer to be indoors and watch TV..\"\nThe last thing I expected when visiting\
  \ Greenland was to be blown away by the mundane."
