Text: "I wasn\u2019t expecting company in the Bothy. I assumed that because I knew\
  \ nothing about Bothies. I had never been to a Bothy. \n \u201CSnowdonia? As in,\
  \ the Welsh Mountains?\u201D my friends had asked. \u201COn New Year\u2019s Eve?\
  \ Why?\u201D\n\u201CI\u2019m going to go Bothying.\u201D I would reply, as if that\
  \ explained everything.\n\u201CWhat\u2019s a Bothy?\u201D they would ask. \n\u201C\
  It\u2019s an abandoned stone shack in the mountains maintained by all who use it\
  \ and left open for anyone to use\u201D. That\u2019s what the internet had told\
  \ me. \nIt was snowing gently when I arrived at the Bothy door. When I opened it\
  \ my eyes took a moment to adjust to the dim interior. Light from the fire shone\
  \ on the faces of the three men who turned to look at me. All three had curly black\
  \ beards. \n\u201CAlright mate. How\u2019s it going?\u201D  One of them extended\
  \ a hand. \u201CI\u2019m Joe\u201D he added. I took off my mitten and shook his\
  \ hand. A rattle of the door half an hour later and Jenny and Philip arrived. The\
  \ only food left in their rucksacks was a bag of jelly beans. I gave them some couscous.\
  \ They were on their first date and had been in the hills for four days.\nThen there\
  \ was the man on his own. I never caught his name. After a grunted hello he didn\u2019\
  t say much. He ate his dinner out of battered army mess tins. \nThen Tom and Geraint\
  \ and Lucy. Tom had carried a crate of twenty beers up in his rucksack. If I had\
  \ just carried twenty tins of beer up a cold Welsh mountain I would have charged\
  \ a painful premium. Fortunately Tom was not like me and he a shared them out with\
  \ a smile.  \nWe all gathered in a tight semi-circle around the fire. Two rusty\
  \ nails held a piece of blue twine above the hearth. All of our socks hung folded\
  \ over this twine. At regular intervals they were shifted along from left to right,\
  \ with the right-most pair removed and placed back on the left end. \nWe had all\
  \ arrived in the same way; up the valley past the tarn under the high dark cliff.\
  \ To the door with no lock. Into the simple stone-walled hut with a fire and a wooden\
  \ table, metal chairs and splintering floorboards. The same look of surprise spread\
  \ across every persons face as they realised that they had company in this isolated\
  \ little hut. \nIn the morning the fire grate was cold and ten pairs of dry socks\
  \ hung on the string. We all woke grumbling and said goodbye and walked away over\
  \ the ridges, memories our only connection. \nThere is a beauty to the rugged individualism\
  \ fostered by mountains. But I deeply enjoyed the unexpected company of the strangers\
  \ gathered in the Bothy that night."
