Text: "I draw the short straw and end up on the hump seat, in the back of a beaten\
  \ up car that\u2019s more an amalgamation of parts then any specific type. A rusty\
  \ bumper and a leather skinned old man were the first things I saw when I hopped\
  \ in that morning. As we pull into a small blueberry farm, the first one to greet\
  \ us is a pug, running alongside the car, barking animatedly. \u201CThat\u2019s\
  \ Maggie. She\u2019s almost as yappy as Barbs.\u201D Our driver, Ron, quips. On\
  \ the drive he gave us a run down of our fellow blueberry pickers and whereas Matt,\
  \ the owner, was spoken of with fondness, Barbs got more of a wary introduction.\
  \ \n\nWe meet the older woman half way through the day, hungover and late for work.\
  \ Matt is fully enamoured as she gives him a motherly peck on the cheek. She's straight\
  \ in with the introductions and all too pleased to be surrounded by female company\
  \ for once. Barbs becomes iconic during those too long days of hot weather and too\
  \ much work for too little pay. From the genuine memoirs of the heart ache of losing\
  \ her husband in a car accident and having to become a working, single mother to\
  \ the unabashed comedic retellings of avoiding the grand kids whilst she smokes\
  \ a spliff in the wooded lands framing her backyard. She's a testament to a well\
  \ lived and loved life.\n\nWe learn of her string of one night stands with mostly\
  \ younger men. She tells us of them proudly and, unfortunately, in detailed description.\
  \ Despite giving up her scandalous life in Sydney for a man and ending up in Coffs\
  \ Harbour where she continues to dwell to stay close to his memory, she is also\
  \ a keen traveller. The most recent escapade included her posing in a sheep skin\
  \ lingerie set in the middle of winter during a family road trip in New Zealand.\
  \ \u201CYou should of seen the son in laws face. He got a right eye full.\u201D\
  \ Her laugh is free of inhibitions, it\u2019s throaty from too much smoking but\
  \ it\u2019s vigour is all the free spirit you could hope for at her age. She's an\
  \ exhibitionist, a stoner, and I could only imagine how she was before young motherhood\
  \ stole her from her youth in the sixties. I remember her lifting us girls up, gushing\
  \ about how we \"got life right\" and should be sure \"not to give ourselves up\
  \ for any man or any mans laws.\" A real feminist crusader. Often, I wonder how\
  \ she'd react knowing I retell her tales to so many other young women I meet on\
  \ the road how I still think of our farewell as a parting of friendship, despite\
  \ the age gap and the difference in upbringing. Cheers to Barbs!"
