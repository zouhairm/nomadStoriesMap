Text: "I had a rare day off and was determined to make the most of it, which is what\
  \ I was telling myself as I held tightly onto the metal genitals of a boar statue.\
  \ We had been assured of good luck if you rubbed the bronze appendage; it wasn\u2019\
  t the most unbelievable line I\u2019d fallen for in this regard. Seemingly, other\
  \ travellers shared my hopeful naivety, for the boar itself was a dull dark aged\
  \ brown, but this area shone bright and golden due to years of firm blind faith.\n\
  We were on our way to the Botanical Gardens in Sydney. The sun was high and heavy\
  \ on our eyes as we googled directions. Apart from being perpetually hungover, there\
  \ was only one state I had been more consistent in, since arriving in Australia,\
  \ and that was lost. I had been Alice lost in Wonderland since the moment I disembarked\
  \ and with every \u201CDrink Me\u201D \u2018goon\u2019 I had shrunk in this vast\
  \ and beautifully bizarre country.\nThe Gardens did nothing to dispel my belief\
  \ of the rabbit hole: a kaleidoscope of blossoms and fragrant plumes dripped from\
  \ a collage of emerald and jade. The sweet rotten smell of hot fruit perfumed the\
  \ fertile air, which hummed with the buzz of hidden life. We were here for cockatoos.\
  \ I had been assured that if one held out an offering of food, a flock would descend\
  \ & bless you with their presence. We realised, too late, none of us had brought\
  \ any food. \nThe full-time tourists were quick to give up; I, feeling the heavy\
  \ weight of work, sprinted away, throwing na\xEFve assurances behind me that I would\
  \ be back shortly. The gardens seemed to expand endlessly. Looking for an exit,\
  \ I found myself posing with 12 middle-aged Chinese business men for a group photo.\
  \ Not one word of mutual language was spoken and then my hands were filled with\
  \ freshly picked & questionable berries. I ate one, politely, hoping I wouldn\u2019\
  t perish before meeting cockatoos.\nI eventually located an overpriced shop. Beaming,\
  \ purse empty and arms laden with sacrificial offerings, I passed a man made of\
  \ dust and hessian who greeting me by throwing a sack at me. It exploded on the\
  \ pavement and a firework of glass tinkled in the air. The confetti rained down\
  \ upon me and I fled, wide-eyed and terrified.\nMy troupe greeted me with complaints\
  \ of how long I\u2019d been; exhausted and mute I held out a TimTam in the sun.\
  \ With greedy reliance the plump white devils descended, happily clawing and biting.\n\
  Food devoured, our ungrateful company retired for the night and we left, covered\
  \ in blood and shit; badges of a day well spent."
