Text: "I set down to take a pill for the stomach at one of the streets of Kathmandu.\
  \ I was waiting to feel better, when a huge car with Nepalese army turned to my\
  \ street and blocked the road. At this moment a local guy passed near me on an old\
  \ Honda motorbike. Because of the blocked street he had to go back. I turned my\
  \ had and saw him standing just near me. \"Where are you from, what are you doing\
  \ here, why did you come here, it's dangerous, you shouldn't be here now\"... He\
  \ was asking and I explained \"why\" and \"for what\".\n\nActually, I was here to\
  \ make my biggest dream to come true. I wanted to see the Himalayas and I did. Then\
  \ I was exploring Kathmandu for one week, then I went for volunteering to the tee\
  \ farm and then I found myself in one of the biggest Earthquake. \n\n-Do you want\
  \ to see the greatest damages in the city? - asked the local guy suddenly\n-Why\
  \ not?\n\nAnd I set on the motorbike with the person, which I knew just for few\
  \ seconds. It was just a moment of hesitation, when you are thinking 'girl, are\
  \ you crazy???' and your instincts just pushing you further. Due to a crazy traffic\
  \ in Kathmandu, due to being in a foreign country on the stranger's motorbike, I\
  \ really had to be scared. But I wasn't. I can't explain why, but I felt very safe\
  \ with that guy.\n\nHis name is Jeetendra, he is 30 and he works as a guide in one\
  \ of the biggest travel agencies of Kathmandu. During the earthquake he was not\
  \ far from the view tower, so he realized quickly the damage scale and ran there.\
  \ Jeeten rescued 6 people and saw many deaths. 'Sad' - it's not the right word to\
  \ describe him at the moment of our meeting. I'd rather call him 'empty'. He told\
  \ me that all the horror he saw is still standing in front of his eyes, and that\u2019\
  s why he was drinking alcohol the days before. Also he said that in tourist season\
  \ he is usually very busy, so he gets home only to take a sleep. 'If this disaster\
  \ hadn't happened, we wouldn't meet for sure' - mentioned Jeeten.\n\nFirst we went\
  \ to the tower, we passed few damaged temples and houses and then stopped at Patan.\
  \ It was getting dark, when we went to the camp near one of the local monasteries.\
  \ Sunset was really beautiful that day. We talked a lot with Jeetendra. Emptiness\
  \ was gone from his face; I saw that he felt better. Actually he even noticed: 'while\
  \ I am talking to you, I am feeling like nothing horrible had happened, I am feeling\
  \ like everything is okay and nothing bad won't happen anymore...'"
