Text: "My best friend, Rebecca, and I have been collecting experiences since high\
  \ school. We\u2019ve been roadtripping since I got my license: drives over the Colorado\
  \ border into Wyoming to smuggle back fireworks and to Denver for burritos and shopping\
  \ malls Rebecca and I decided to bring 2018 in together in Moab, Utah.\nEveryone\
  \ knows Arches. Even in the winter, hoards of tourists flock to Delicate Arch, Utah\u2019\
  s most popular destination for tourists from around the globe looking to get that\
  \ perfect Instagram snap.This may be ideal for many, but it was missing the magic\
  \ I had craved from the desert. We decided to make the icy trek to Delicate Arch.\
  \ We raced twenty tourists to the top, greeting fifty more who appeared from thin\
  \ air. Had they been here all night? After we got our photos, we turned around and\
  \ gave up on solitude in Moab. We drove through crowded streets to a crowded diner,\
  \ and searched for a room in a crowded town.\nOn our second day, we chose the less\
  \ popular Canyonlands National Park. The hike for the day was in the Needles District.\
  \ Once in Needles, we started on the trail, Squaw Canyon, and the trail was empty.\
  \ The park was empty. The whole world could have been empty. Together, we realized\
  \ the boundaries of Canyonlands paired with isolation of the Needles would provide\
  \ us with the solitary wilderness we sought. The sun beat down on our heads and\
  \ faces, and, even though it was January, we were able to hike without our jackets\
  \ and beanies. We trekked along a snowy path until we reached a seemingly endless\
  \ wall of exposed slick rock. Only cairns led the way up and over. We walked for\
  \ half a mile, then came to the edge of a canyon. Typically chatty hikers, we were\
  \ silenced by the endless seclusion and blue sky against red sandstone. \nWe spent\
  \ the rest of the day exploring, dissatisfied with our lack of time to see it all.\
  \ We arrived at Confluence Point, where the Colorado and Green Rivers collide. We\
  \ hiked down to the bottom. We gleefully played in the dry riverbed, remarking our\
  \ favorite refrain from the day, \"Canyonlands! It feels like we\u2019re cheating!\"\
  \ We were less than two miles from a road, in the middle of a canyon, surrounded\
  \ by astounding geological formations. Canyonlands awakened an infantile sense of\
  \ wonder in both of us. And for so much of the day, we enjoyed it as the only inhabitants.\
  \ As we danced our way back up the canyon, I realized that the last thing I\u2019\
  d expected was to fall in love with a National Park I had never heard of before."
