Text: "Shanti is 24 years old. Her oldest son is thirteen.\nWhat lured me into her\
  \ \u201Ccold store\u201D for the first time was Carol Buckley, founder of Elephant\
  \ Aid International, who sat there drinking tea. So I went in to buy some cookies,\
  \ and of course a cold coke from the fridge that gave the store its name, and to\
  \ talk about elephants.\nSince then, I have been there almost every day, and Shanti\
  \ has become my friend. She makes friends easily, by inviting people for milk tea,\
  \ sharing fruits with them, talking in her adorable Nepali accent. Not many of the\
  \ shop keepers in Sauraha, Nepal, speak such good English. I meet the Australian\
  \ photographer Chantelle, who is also with Elephant Aid, Jack, the intern at the\
  \ Nepali Nature Trust, and Shaun, the American zookeeper. Sometimes the women from\
  \ the neighborhood stop by to ask for cookies, cigarettes, or raksi, the Nepali\
  \ rice liquor that tastes horrible to every other nationality, or want to use the\
  \ sewing machine.\nAt night she keeps fried chicken feet and raksi for the drunken\
  \ regulars at her store, all the time working on her other tasks. The money goes\
  \ into hers kids\u2019 education \u2013 they attend a private school, because Shanti\
  \ wants them to have a brighter future.\nShe herself only had five years of school\
  \ \u2013 then, a man named Raju came into her village in the distant Nepali countryside.\
  \ He is nine years older than little Shanti. A year later, they are married.\n\u201C\
  Married life is not good\u201D she says. Eleven-year-old Shanti can\u2019t cook\
  \ the way she is expected to by her new family. Still, she is the only one in the\
  \ house who cooks, cleans, does laundry. She works in a rice field, cares for a\
  \ vegetable garden, which gets destroyed by rhinos every now and then, and she runs\
  \ her store. \u201CShe is a master of everything,\u201D says Chantelle, and she\
  \ is right. Shanti sews handbags, she knits and crochets, she makes baskets and\
  \ wooden elephants. \nWith all her work, and the lack of sleep, she is always happy,\
  \ and always finds time for me. \u201CMarina, tea?\u201D she asks, when I drop by\
  \ in the afternoon. Sometimes it\u2019s regular black tea, sometimes with spices,\
  \ lemon, honey, or fresh milk from her buffalo. We drink tea, she sews, and I learn\
  \ and ask questions. \u201CLove marriage?\u201D \u2013 \u201CYes, love. Love is\
  \ good!\u201D But Raju is now in England, to work and get better medical treatment\
  \ than in Nepal. Almost every day, the skype, at least, when the connection is good\
  \ enough. Raju knows that I come by all the time to spend time with his wife \u2013\
  \ she tells him everything."
