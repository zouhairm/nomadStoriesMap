Text: "As you bump along on cracked polyester seats, the tendrils of a mystic, green\
  \ paradise scraping by your dusty bus window; you can hear your fellow passengers\
  \ discuss the living spirit that inhabits their home. The island, they say, will\
  \ spit out those who are not ready for it. A man in the back shares his story with\
  \ the stranger next to him. The pure joy of picking fruit in the tropical heat,\
  \ a job and a place to stay offered to him by a kind stranger on a whim. They bask\
  \ their words in the glow of a reverence to the powerful energies of Kauai.\n\n\
  \ Everywhere you step foot, the creaky old bus, the floorboards of a jewellery shop\
  \ kiosk you duck under to escape the rain; people talk about their little island\
  \ as if it is a living entity, a goddess who grants wishes or blows you away with\
  \ the flick of her breath. Booking my flight to Hawaii I had failed to account for\
  \ a living, breathing island with the ability to break down my walls. Walls I had\
  \ forged in the chilly, concrete jungle I\u2019d grown up in, where people flinch\
  \ at eye contact on the subway. \n\n After two months of working in a hostel in\
  \ Maui, I am surprised to feel a warmth beyond the sun that has toasted my Canadian\
  \ vampire skin. At the suggestion of locals, my friends and I get around by meeting\
  \ kind strangers in the backs of their cars, listening as they tell us where to\
  \ find the secret, quiet corners of the island. \n  \n This is how I find myself\
  \ on a plane to Kauai. Meeting another Canadian in Maui travelling there at the\
  \ same time my job ends, he offers to drive me around. I accept, realizing my armour\
  \ of suspicion has been chipped away by the gentle presence of the Hawaii\u2019\
  n people and the fresh dirt beneath my bare feet. \n\n Right off the plane we drive\
  \ to a white sand beach stretching for miles against a lavender sky, blanketed by\
  \ a wide expanse of thick, teeming waves. Our reserved Canadian pretences fall,\
  \ replaced by kids who laugh and run wild. \n\n The next day, a woman in our hostel\
  \ tells us about a white sand beach that goes on forever; the Hawaiians believe\
  \ it is an ancient epicentre of unbridled emotion and spirit. I begin to understand\
  \ the people here, discussing their land as if a respected elder, a breathing, emoting\
  \ entity. I see our streets back home, trampled beneath garbage and machine. \n\
  \ \n Thick, luscious greenery brushes my shoulder and salty air hits my nose as\
  \ I make way to the ocean. There, I see my face clearly reflected in the still,\
  \ early morning waters."
