Text: "\u201CMunhana\u201D he said.\n\u201CMunhana\u201D I repeated for the third\
  \ time that \"thank you\" in the local language, although it seemed to me it sounded\
  \ right beforehand. Then it occurred to me \u2013 it was the humble and gratitude\
  \ body language that I was missing. \nI was trying to find out more about the Ifugao\
  \ people in Banaue, Northern Philippines, at the rice terraces and he, only twenty\
  \ years old, was the guide for the two of us. Oh, boy, his English was good! He\
  \ told us about hudhub, the narrative of Ifugao people, an epic dealing with hero\
  \ ancestors sung in a poetic manner.\nThey say the rice terraces of Banaue are 1500\
  \ metres above sea level. They were home for some remote villages. John, this guy,\
  \ pointed to the school and church down there where I could see a dozen of houses.\
  \ We were surrounded by massive green stairways, me barefoot, sitting on a stone,\
  \ he facing me, explaining further. \nWhen we reached Banaue we head to a hotel\
  \ receptionist asking for a local guide to the terraces. The woman in front offered\
  \ a jeepney trip, kind of expensive and with too many people, not quite my taste.\
  \ Then suggested that going with others or alone would be a danger. \n\u201CVery\
  \ bad men\u201D she said rolling her eyes.\nOutside, John was playing his part and\
  \ somehow we listened to our gut. An hour later we were travelling by his motorized\
  \ tricycle to the rice terraces. \nJohn wanted development, stores and railways\
  \ in the area. What could I say? That all I wanted was that pristine environment\
  \ to remain the same for the rest of our lives? Hours later, above the rice terraces,\
  \ among the palm trees, we could see from time to time jeepneys full of people.\
  \ Some were sitting on the roof.  \u201CHeart of darkness\u201D or \u201CGod bless\
  \ our trip\u201D said the messages written on the bus. We picked one to take us\
  \ to the accommodation and left behind the green stairways. We paid our part to\
  \ the young guide and as a sign of courtesy John said he will see us to the bus\
  \ station next day. Above the seats I could see a mirror. The woman in front was\
  \ checking her lipstick in the mirror. The guy at the end of the row watched insistently\
  \ the mirror above me and it occurred to me it\u2019s the woman at the other end\
  \ of the row he was looking at. Maybe there were other ways of socializing after\
  \ all.  \nNext day early morning we could see neither John, nor the tricycle. We\
  \ saw no reason why he would come, anyway. A few minutes later he was there. He\
  \ saw us to the station by tricycle. Once in the bus, we waved goodbye with gratitude."
