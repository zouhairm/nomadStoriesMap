Text: "When I tried to catch some sleep on Friday night, I had no luck. Not because\
  \ I was going on my first bike ride or fear of the butthurt jokes coming back at\
  \ me. Sleep escaped me for one reason: I did not know what to expect. My boyfriend\
  \ reluctantly approached me a week ago about a ride he was planning. He went on\
  \ bike rides often and would beg me to join him every time only to be met with a\
  \ no. But this time, I wanted to experience it. I wanted to see how a bike ride\
  \ could light up that cute tired face. I jumped at the chance. \n\nI knew everything\
  \ that I had to be prepared for: \n\nStay hydrated\nWear comfortable clothing\n\
  Condition your butt for prolonged sitting on a pseudo soft seat\nPack chocolates\n\
  Charge battery pack, camera & phone\nGet good sleep before the early ride\n\nThat\
  \ last part seemed easy before. I had watched motovlogs & read travelogues but I\
  \ could only get so much information from them. A bike ride was something new and\
  \ my butterflies were more excited than ever. I finally managed to fall asleep while\
  \ wondering where Melukote was. \n\nI woke up abruptly. My phone read 0515. We had\
  \ to be at Nelamangala at 0530 and we hadn\u2019t even gotten up. We were late!\
  \ Panic ensued as we took quick turns in the shower, threw on warm clothes and rushed\
  \ out the door to our rental KTM 250. The other bikers were at the rendezvous and\
  \ we were still hurrying past Sankey Road. I was regretting my decisions already.\
  \ I was sleepy and the bike was zooming past the trickling traffic, cutting through\
  \ the numbing cold Bengaluru air while my eyes barely managed to keep up with the\
  \ tears. My chauffeur for the day promised me the speeding was only till we all\
  \ met up and that the highway would be slow and peaceful. I held on.   \n\nOh, I\
  \ completely forgot. We were going to Melukote, a small temple town off the Hassan\
  \ Highway with my chauffeur\u2019s Reddit friends who were as stupid as he was to\
  \ wake up so early on a Saturday. \n\nWe finally reached the Nelamangala at around\
  \ 0620, a feat I never thought was possible in Bengaluru traffic. An impatient bunch\
  \ welcomed our late faces. There were 4 bikes and fortunately, another car that\
  \ was yet to arrive.\n\nAnyway, to my surprise, there were more bikers around the\
  \ junction. I audibly gasped when my boyfriend started to point out the different\
  \ expensive bikes sprinkled around. Now I had to experience this. What was so exciting\
  \ about riding a two-wheeler for so long for a simple breakfast? 10 mins and a few\
  \ pictures later, the ride began."
