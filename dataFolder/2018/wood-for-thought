Text: "I lay down, reclining in my canoe. The thick humidity blanket was lifting as\
  \ it darkened, leaving the air unusually crisp for Thailand. I couldn\u2019t help\
  \ but picture the adventures I had read about before arriving, people getting stalked\
  \ by bears, crossing crocodile infested rivers, hiring local guides and trekking\
  \ for miles. Yet even in Khao Sok, one of the oldest rain forests on the planet.\
  \ I still felt so comfortable.\n\n\L\LI haven\u2019t had a bad life. In fact, I\u2019\
  ve led a very complacent one - and that\u2019s part of the problem. I\u2019ve got\
  \ \u2018the bug\u2019. Itchy feet, ambitious plans, long daydreams. I\u2019ve spent\
  \ years suppressing my wanderlust  and months preparing to feed it, with adventure\
  \ books and late night googling sessions. One book in particular stood out and shaped\
  \ my idea of how I wanted to travel.\L It was a book that\u2019s existence told\
  \ me exactly what I wanted to hear. That modern day adventure and exploration were\
  \ possible. It was aptly named \u2018Eastern horizons\u2019.\n\n\L\LIt got darker\
  \ still, and the calm monotone lake silhouetted together with the forest canopy.\
  \  A piercing, continual scream broke my attention, back to what I could remember\
  \ from skimming a wildlife book at the office - Warnings of Malayan Pit vipers and\
  \ Asian elephants. \LI struggled for a moment to picture what the sound could be.\L\
  \L\n\nLeon, a dutch man in this thirties paddled past and muttered something that\
  \ seemed unusually close to English, although none of which I understood. I couldn\u2019\
  t make out where he was, but Heard him agitatedly paddle back towards the dim orange\
  \ light, strapped to the side of the floating bungalow. \n\L\u201CGood idea\u201D\
  \ I murmured as I prepared to follow suite. \L\nThe feint image of a longboat slowly\
  \ putted past, the echo was distorted through the jungle, sounding more like a large\
  \ flock of birds as it got closer. It dawned on me that I had perhaps spent too\
  \ long reading about wild boars and tigers.\L\L\n\nThis place was undoubtedly foreign.\
  \ The food in itself looked like an adventure, but, it was all delicious. \n\LI\
  \ could barely understand anyone, yet they were all so friendly. \n\LWhat I least\
  \ expected from a place like this, was to feel right at home, and still be missing\
  \ something.\n \n\LI arrived back to find Leon tying up his canoe. \L\n\"it really\
  \ is untouched, isn\u2019t it?\" he remarked.\L\nI agreed, smirking to myself as\
  \ more adventurous idea\u2019s cemented themselves into my mind. \nI set back to\
  \ find my book and plan my next move. Resigning that the author, Levison Wood, would\
  \ be proud."
