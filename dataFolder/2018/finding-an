Text: "\u201CI take you there. You are late\u201D, said my hostel hostess, An. She\
  \ was aware that I had been taking economy private car pick-up services to reach\
  \ other ends of Ho Chi Minh city and that I was agreeable to the charge being 2x\
  \ more than that of a motorcycle pick-up service. \u201CWait here\u201D, and she\
  \ disappeared around the corner. As I sat down worried about missing the bus to\
  \ the Cu Chi Tunnels, another worry began to grow. Piecing together how An was to\
  \ take me to the bus pick-up point with her trying to convince me to travel via\
  \ moto to save money, the thought manifested into reality as she rode over to me\
  \ on her motorcycle. Handing me a helmet, I paled slightly.\n\nSome years back,\
  \ I became traumatised for 3 months after an attempted snatch-theft by delinquents\
  \ on motorcycles. Let\u2019s say being dragged on pavement and rough pebbles for\
  \ 20m, then being surrounded by knife wielders, was quite a nightmare. Was not a\
  \ fan of motorcycles then, but after the incident, I was on the border of despise.\n\
  \nThank goodness for my tanned skin. It\u2019s now or risk wasting the limited time\
  \ I have for this trip. With the clock ticking to catch the bus, I latched on the\
  \ helmet, jumped pillion on her moto like how I see them do in the movies, and said\
  \ a prayer.\n\nBreathe.. Breathe.. Breathe..\n\nThe warm sunshine sprinkled us with\
  \ butterfly kisses as we sped through the streets. Weaving in and out of the congested\
  \ traffic. Brushing in close proximity to large vehicles. Incoming transports and\
  \ pedestrians. Lots of sound horns beeping.\n\nBeepbeepbeep. Breathe.. Beepbeepbeep.\
  \ Breathe.. Beepbeepbeep. Breathe..\n\nThat\u2019s when I had an epiphany on the\
  \ system of the sound horn in Ho Chi Minh. Unlike the country I currently reside\
  \ in where the horn is used to indicate the level of anger or annoyance one has,\
  \ the beeping here is used to notify the surrounding vehicles and pedestrians that\
  \ one is there and going to cut in or across of them. Breathe.\n\nWe arrived swiftly\
  \ and safely, and I thanked my hostel hostess profusely as I joined the group to\
  \ Cu Chi. What she probably didn\u2019t realise was my additional gratitude. From\
  \ that one ride, I was set free from the horror shackles and haunting demons I had\
  \ for motorcycles, and took many more rides thereafter.\n\nI found An."
