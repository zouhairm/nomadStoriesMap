Text: "The soft setting sun and mist of the ocean breeze in Miraflores told me the\
  \ time to return home was approaching. I spent the day touring the bustling city\
  \ built atop the steep cliffside and my legs were beginning to complain. My host\
  \ for the evening was located in a poor part of town and had warned me of the dangers\
  \ of being in Lima after dark, even in the touristy areas like Miraflores.\n\nIt\
  \ was my first time traveling abroad after a close friend offered to buy a ticket\
  \ to the destination of my choosing as a birthday present. He had just returned\
  \ from a military deployment and was estactic to share the travel bug.\n\nPeru called\
  \ to me. \n\nWith historical sites like Machu Picchu, the natural beauty of the\
  \ Amazon Jungle, and a diverse range of landscapes spread over a thin area, my decision\
  \ was clear.\n\nTwo years of high school Spanish and minor practice on a language\
  \ app made me nowhere near fluent, yet I was able to make my way around Peru with\
  \ little difficulty.\n\nDespite the language not being an issue, finding my way\
  \ home in an unfamiliar city proved to be more daunting of a task than I anticipated.\
  \ After a few minutes of reading the map under the dim yellow flood of the streetlight,\
  \ a kind elderly man in white approached me. My broken Spanish and his equally proficient\
  \ English made the interaction more akin to an art interpretation than a conversation.\
  \ However, eventually a single phrase was communicated that froze me down to the\
  \ sweat in my socks.\n\nIf I were to continue on my course, the man warned, I could\
  \ get stabbed.\n\nThoroughly shocked, I followed my savior in a slight daze, repeating\
  \ the phrase in my mind. We walked together until the local mall came into view,\
  \ a spot regularly patrolled by the tourist police, decked in bright teal and supposedly\
  \ bilingual. Unfortunately their bilingual skills were worse than mine but after\
  \ some verbal interpretations among us, the man in white was confident enough to\
  \ leave me in the hands of my newfound guardians. \n\nThanking the man, I began\
  \ ensuring the police that I did need to go to THAT area of town. \n\nOne officer\
  \ finally motioned for me to follow him into his vehicle, taxi-ing me the short\
  \ ride to the train station. There, he guided me through buying a ticket before\
  \ pairing me with another elderly man, who ensured my safe exit from the train at\
  \ the correct stop.\n\nAfter walking the remaining distance home, I laid in bed,\
  \ awestruck at what could have happened and the unwarrented kindness of people to\
  \ a stranger."
