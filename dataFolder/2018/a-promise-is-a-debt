Text: "Roger is not my idea of a Costa Rican bushman. He\u2019s short and fair-skinned,\
  \ and his eyes are too blue. He speaks perfect English.\nHe greets me at a tiny\
  \ Costa Rican airstrip and smiles warmly, before we begin our trek through the rainforest\
  \ to the lodge where I\u2019ll be staying.\nHis English isn\u2019t surprising; Costa\
  \ Rica\u2019s literacy rate is incredibly high. I\u2019m told many families sneak\
  \ in from neighbouring Nicaragua hoping to take advantage of a \u2018tico education\u2019\
  , low crime rates, no standing army, and 28 national parks. It\u2019s a welcoming\
  \ place; Everyone greets you with a smile and toasts you with the national motto:\
  \ Pura Vida!\nHowever, as Roger talks about growing up in the jungle, hunting, fleeing\
  \ jaguars, and kayaking for days to trade, I see the other side of tico life.\n\
  Walking through the wild, rugged rainforests of the country\u2019s Osa Peninsula,\
  \ Roger explains that yes, there are fish, wild pigs and pineapples. But, he says\
  \ as he slips between trees, ducking under dripping, huge-fronded plants, the country\
  \ is also deadly.\n\u201CHow do I know this?\u201D he asks, rhetorically. He holds\
  \ up his left hand. He\u2019s missing his index finger, just above the first knuckle.\n\
  Roger was bitten on his finger by the fer-de-lance viper. Its potent venom rots\
  \ the body. To save his life, he did the only thing he could: He cut the finger\
  \ off.\nI\u2019m shocked. Why didn\u2019t he go to hospital?\n\u201CBecause I was\
  \ eleven, in the rainforest. I would have died,\u201D he says matter-of-factly.\n\
  This is life, then, in Costa Rica. Behind the turtles and surfing, beneath magma-spewing\
  \ volcanoes, these wonderful people live amongst over 130 species of snake and the\
  \ world\u2019s most poisonous spider. \nRoger laughs, waving away my look of horror.\
  \ It\u2019s fine, he says. Just watch where I walk and don\u2019t put my hands on\
  \ trees, because the fer-de-lance rests in the bark.\nI ask him if anything scares\
  \ him. He shrugs. The jaguar. Here, in the rainforest, it\u2019s the apex predator.\n\
  We travel through the rainforest for days. We eat termites, canoe down rivers, bivouac\
  \ in the torrential rain. He shows me caiman, tapirs and coati. \nWhen he bids me\
  \ farewell, I ask if there\u2019s anything I can do to thank him. He points to my\
  \ wax hat. That would keep the rain off, he says.\nI promise to send him one.\n\
  He shakes his head. No. Promises are debts to be repaid. Don\u2019t promise him\
  \ a hat. Return one day, find him and give him one as a gift, he says. That\u2019\
  s the tico way.\nI shake his hand. I will, I say.\nHe smiles, nods. Pura Vida.\n\
  Pura Vida, I reply."
