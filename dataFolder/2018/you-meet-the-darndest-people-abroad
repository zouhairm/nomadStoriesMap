Text: "Growing up in different countries, I have always thought it's a small world--but\
  \ what happened in Barcelona truly dropped my jaw. To set the scene, this happened\
  \ on a blazingly fast Euro tour I did with my best friend from high school, Matt.\
  \ We hadn't seen each other for years and planned to hit around 10 countries in\
  \ just over a week. Matt and I have always kept our encounters wild: from sneaking\
  \ into 14th century schools for a midnight picnic (and then being chased out by\
  \ a machete-wielding homeless man) to bringing a loaf of bread to a nightclub and\
  \ ending up on its billboard. Before you say that sounds implausible, we went to\
  \ high school in New Delhi, India. However, our craziness pales in comparison to\
  \ how wild our teachers were. Not even a week after starting school there, Matt\
  \ and I saw our teachers in the biggest party district in New Delhi. When I saw\
  \ them, a Spanish teacher and a volleyball coach, my stomach flipped. Suddenly,\
  \ the teachers walked up to a wall and began peeing in the street. One of them noticed\
  \ us and instead of reprimanding us, he turned and waved, saying \"Hey guys! What's\
  \ up?\" They didn't say anything about us being on the billboard either!\n\nAnyway,\
  \ Matt and I were clearly looking to emulate some of these crazy nights during in\
  \ Europe. So, Matt booked a dirt-cheap hostel--just like the one that gave me hundreds\
  \ of insect bites last time. Not an hour after landing, we decided to go out and\
  \ see the town, even though it was midnight. As we turned our first corner while\
  \ searching for the bars, I mentioned to him how fun it was to finally use the Spanish\
  \ we learned together in India. As we turned our second corner, there was our Spanish\
  \ teacher. I couldn't believe it, so I turned to Matt to confirm. Before I could\
  \ say anything, he interrupted, \"Is that Mr. Kim?\" \n\n\"Maybe?\" I responded\
  \ hesitantly. There definitely weren't many people around who looked like him, a\
  \ former model from Korea, but what would he be doing in Barcelona... on a school\
  \ night? \n\n\"Let's look him up,\" Matt suggested. So we did. As we were typing\
  \ queries into Facebook and searching staff directories, Mr. Kim collapsed into\
  \ his friend's arms and burst into laughter. They helped lean him against the wall\
  \ and continued having a blast. \n\n\"Morgan... it says he moved to Barcelona to\
  \ teach high school last year...\" \n\"Well, I guess that's him. Should we say hi?\"\
  \ \n\nBefore we could make a move, we heard excited, drunk shouting.\n\n\"Hey guys!\
  \ What's up?\""
