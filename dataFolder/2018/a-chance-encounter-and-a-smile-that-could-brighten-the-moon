Text: "Her hand was hot and dry in mine, we were running fast, hands clasped together,\
  \ we both had flip-flops on our feet; the orange dust from the dirt track sloppily\
  \ churning up beneath us as our legs hit the ground. We were running along the main\
  \ road that runs through Prey Veng province in northern Cambodia. Mony had met me\
  \ from the bus taxi, half a mile up the road and I recognised her instantly, her\
  \ long black hair tumbling below her shoulders, her brilliant bright smile beaming\
  \ as the bus taxi pulled in, I was so thrilled to see her again.\n\nMony and I had\
  \ met in Stung Treng market two weeks previously, she was working at the market\
  \ selling coffee and I had bought one from her; the greatest coffee I\u2019d had\
  \ whilst in Cambodia, strong, cold and sweet. Like in many Asian countries, iced\
  \ coffee, mixed with condensed milk is very popular and although possibly not the\
  \ most nutritious, it certainly is delicious. Mony and I got talking and albeit\
  \ not for long, in that time we talked, we laughed, we connected. We asked each\
  \ other about our families and she said she would love to introduce me to hers when\
  \ I came back from Laos. I didn\u2019t hesitate in accepting the invitation and\
  \ I couldn\u2019t wait to see where this beautiful, talkative, engaged and energetic\
  \ girl came from and spent her time when she wasn\u2019t at the market and to meet\
  \ her family. \n\nThe midday sun was burning, beating down on all the people that\
  \ graced the path beneath its rays. As we ran, both filled with excitement and anticipation\
  \ to her home, I noticed old glass Fanta bottles filled with yellow opaque liquid\
  \ and asked her what they were? Petrol for mottos she shouted back, a lot cheaper\
  \ than the petrol stations and one 330ml glass bottle would do a good few miles\
  \ fuelling a moped. Makes sense I thought and we kept running and eventually we\
  \ came to an abrupt stop, and turned left off the main dirt road to a much quieter\
  \ and smaller dirt track. Either side of it lined with wooden houses, some looked\
  \ quite grand, high wooden stilts where the houses perched balanced on top. Others\
  \ were little more than pieces of wood stuck together to make a shelter which would\
  \ house up to eight or so family members in one hut. \n\nIt was corn season and\
  \ every other house had sheets of corn drying out in front of the entrances to people\u2019\
  s homes, pale in colour, overflowing in amount, the hundreds and thousands of corn\
  \ kernels lined the road like confetti adorning a brides path. Mony stopped outside\
  \ one such corn sheet and we went in."
