Text: "Lingering smoke from cooking fires mixed with the stench of dried fish and\
  \ human waste, and the air was hot and heavy. The slums of Malabon, just north of\
  \ Manila, were built on a landfill and thus continually sinking over the years into\
  \ putrid black water. \nArriving at our lodging, two young girls led my friend and\
  \ I up a steep staircase to a room not much larger than the mattress on the floor.\
  \ A local family offered what little they had and allowed us to stay in their spare\
  \ room.\n\u201CYou can leave this light on,\u201D one of the girls explained.\n\u201C\
  Do you want us to turn it off when we sleep?\u201D I said, not wanting to cause\
  \ them extra expense.\n\u201CYou can turn it off if you want to,\u201D she replied\
  \ politely. I knew her culture would never allow her to tell me directly what we\
  \ should do, but I finally got an answer.\n\u201CIf you leave it on, it helps keep\
  \ the rats away.\u201D\nEnough said--we left it on. Still, a few minutes after the\
  \ girls had left, I heard a scuttling noise behind me above my head. I froze, knowing\
  \ what it was but hoping I was wrong. I slowly twisted around and locked eyes with\
  \ the biggest rat I\u2019d ever seen, the size of a small cat, similarly frozen\
  \ on the beam above. He stared at me intently, as if equally horrified to see me\
  \ standing there. \n\nSome days prior to this, I was sitting at a table in a house\
  \ in Naga City, Philippines with fifteen other people that were part of my team.\
  \ We were in the Philippines to work with local nonprofits and serve the Filipinos\
  \ in any way we could. \n\u201CWe\u2019re going to split the team,\u201D one of\
  \ the leaders explained. \u201CYou can decide which place you would like to go to.\u201D\
  \ I knew nothing about either location, but hearing that Malabon would involve working\
  \ with children, I made my decision fairly quickly. \n\u201CI will go to Malabon.\u201D\
  \n\nUndoubtedly I encountered many challenges for that decision, but loving people\
  \ was more important to me. The children were beautiful and curious, eager for attention.\
  \ They would bang their tiny fists on the doors of the church we partnered with\
  \ every day, shouting over and over,  \u201CAte! Kuya! (big sister, big brother)\
  \ Open da door!\u201D \nWe couldn\u2019t always oblige them, and I marveled at their\
  \ persistency. Malabon was full of persistence; a tenacity to hold on to hope, to\
  \ grasp life by the collar and determine to live well no matter the challenges they\
  \ would face."
