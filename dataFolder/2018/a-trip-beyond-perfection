Text: "This journey was a bit different from every other trip I ever took.   This\
  \ journey is not about fun or happiness. This is not about visiting a new place,\
  \ a new country or meeting new people. This is not a planned holiday or reunion\
  \ trip. But, it had everything but in a different way.\nI always had a clear thing\
  \ about travelling. For me travelling was never about having a holiday. I have my\
  \ own theory about \u201CDifference between Holiday, Trips and travelling\u201D\
  . I love travelling though. For me traveling with no motive is all that matters.\
  \ I know that sounds strange but yes that is how I like to travel.\n\nI can not\
  \ explain exactly what came to my mind when I told myself that no matter how much\
  \ cash I have in my wallet I am going to travel with that with no destination. There\
  \ was 1500 rupees in my wallet and it was not too much, definitely not for travelling.\
  \ \nBut it was a promise I made to myself and I had no intention to break it to\
  \ make any excuse. Though my credit cards and ATMs were loaded but I decided not\
  \ to take them with me. I left my phone as well. It was 5 in the morning and I was\
  \ standing on the platform of Hazart Nizamudin Railway Station. \nThough the language\
  \ was a big barrier as the were not regular English or Hindi people and I am not\
  \ a regular kannad speaking guy. But eventually we shared our thoughts and feelings\
  \ in I can not say which language. I left for goa the other morning as I had to\
  \ go back to my regular life. This place was clean, no extra people, my own luxurious\
  \ seat and still left with 200 rupees but I was missing the unhygienic unreserved\
  \ compartment. Though the journey was still left but suddenly the comfort did not\
  \ pleasure me enough. I lie down on my seat and started to think about my whole\
  \ journey, Rameshwar, Jack, guys from Germany, policemen, drinks, stars, the Kannad\
  \ family and I don\u2019t know what else. This journey was not what it sounds like,\
  \ it is more than that. I was going back to my regular sophisticated life with not\
  \ so real problems. For me this trip was lot about learning, smiling and sharing\
  \ things. I did not know how many families use to live on my floor but yes I made\
  \ friend from different parts of the planet. I learnt how to be happy with lots\
  \ of trouble and moreover I got more than I expected."
