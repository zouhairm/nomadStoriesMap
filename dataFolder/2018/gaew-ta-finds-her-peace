Text: "Gaew Ta's grunt is hollow. She breathes roughly and rapidly as I guide her\
  \ face closer. I nervously tap her trunk, first gaining her trust and then wielding\
  \ the banana closer. I wait for her approval. She grabs the banana and swallows\
  \ it in one swoop. I stare her in the eye and start to laugh\u2014it's the start\
  \ of a beautiful friendship. \n\nThe 50-year-old blind elephant is a darling\u2014\
  literally as her name suggests in Thai. I follow her down a mud-soaked path as she's\
  \ guided by her mahout, Moss. There is a determination in her eyes as she trudges\
  \ to the water hole in the center of the Phuket Elephant Sanctuary. She is as innocuous\
  \ as she is intelligent, but the sagging rings under her eyes tell a story that\
  \ goes far beyond her years in this green paradise.  \n\nOne glance at the Thai\
  \ elephant suggests that something is wrong. There are burn marks on her skin from\
  \ cigarettes. The is a deep hole on her forehead from a mahout, a elephant trainer,\
  \ who repeatedly used an elephant hook to beat and control her. Her ears are battered\
  \ and ripped. And her eyes, sightless from a sling-shot. \n\nGaew Ta is not the\
  \ only one. She is one of eight elephants at the sanctuary who have suffered a similar\
  \ fate in the name of Thailand's lucrative tourist industry.\n\nThree days later,\
  \ I visit the Damnoen Saduak floating market, located about 100 km outside of Bangkok's\
  \ city core. The tour starts on skinny boats as we navigate through a maze of narrow\
  \ khlongs. Locals wait on either side eager to make a souvenir sale and I buy an\
  \ overpriced painting of an elephant for 1000 bahts. \n\nWe end the two-hour tour\
  \ and exit into tourist amusement trap of sorts. There is a small shooting range,\
  \ a liger (lion-tiger) display and a line-up of twenty people waiting for elephant\
  \ rides. My eyes fall on the hands of an elephant trainer helping a passenger onto\
  \ the elephant. He holds a sharp elephant hook and hits the elephant's ears to stay\
  \ steady. \n\nMy heart breaks. I leave, immediately hating myself for paying for\
  \ this tour. I felt like a betrayed Gaew Ta and her friends. How could I? How could\
  \ anyone? I'm angry at everyone for not knowing\u2014not caring to know these elephants'\
  \ stories. \n\nGaew Ta stands at the edge of the water hole and slides down into\
  \ the fresh water. She trumpets as she swims with her friends, two other elephants\
  \ already in the water. She is in control and she is happy. \n\nI watch her and\
  \ dare not interrupt.  \n\nShe is, finally, at peace. \n\nOther elephants, however,\
  \ are not as lucky."
