Text: "I was planning a trip to Jamaica but wanted some adventure and a new experience\
  \ this time.   So, I got on the internet and searched for ideas.  There it was!\
  \  A big beautiful treehouse in the bush of the jungle.  The photos were great and\
  \ it was the most secluded property I'd ever seen.  It was surrounded by exotic\
  \ flowers, fruit trees, vegetation and mountains.  It was like a dream.\n\nThe man\
  \ that owned it was a Professor in New York who rented the treehouse out when he\
  \ wasn't staying in it.  It even came with a caretaker named Juicy who would take\
  \ care of all our needs.  I immediately called the phone number on the ad and began\
  \ speaking with the Professor.  It was all set up and my wife and I were on our\
  \ way to Jamaica for a 6 month stay.\n\nOn the flight, we discussed how wonderful\
  \ it will be to stay with the locals, learn more of their culture. and eat fruit\
  \ and vegetables from our own yard.  We would be in good hands with our own caretaker\
  \ that would fill all our needs.  It was exciting to say the least.\n\nUpon arrival\
  \ at the airport, we were greeted by 2 friendly gentlemen in a new white Toyota\
  \ Camry.  Our new friends names were Juicy (the caretaker) and his friend who owned\
  \ the car, Huggy.  Before we knew it we were on our way up the mountains thru narrow\
  \ winding roads, around the cliffs, and barely wide enough for one car.  It took\
  \ about 1 1/2 hours to get there when we finally arrived.  As we drove into the\
  \ long driveway with trees bending over us like a tunnel, we finally reached our\
  \ destination.\n\nThere was our treehouse in the bush and very secluded.  The adventure\
  \ of a lifetime was awaiting as we walked toward our new residence for the next\
  \ 6 months.  There was our house in the trees that we'd been waiting for.  It was\
  \ covered in vines, with broken wooden stairs,  a rikkity makeshift ladder, large\
  \ holes in the screens, and 2 single slat board beds with cot like mattresses.\n\
  \nAs you can imagine, shock began to set in as we climbed up the ladder to take\
  \ a look.  Not only was the treehouse in shambles, the yard was unkempt, there were\
  \ no more fruit trees or vegetables, and the flowers were scarce.  We were now in\
  \ total shock as we asked Juicy more about it.  There was no electricity, no plumbing,\
  \ and a 200 year old outhouse that we had to walk 50ft. through 2 ft. of mud during\
  \ the rainy season. \n\nIt was the last thing we expected but we made the best of\
  \ it since we were on a shoestring budget.  The best part was the river powered\
  \ outdoor shower."
