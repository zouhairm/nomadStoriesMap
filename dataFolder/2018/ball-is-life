Text: "Quite often we find ourselves wearing fake smiles when dealing with crowds\
  \ to hide our veils of vulnerability. An ability we\u2019ve developed over countless\
  \ of outbursts of silent violent outcries. On these walks of fragileness, our one\
  \ and only weakness is that we are helped by none.  This was not easy for me to\
  \ understand, especially ay my age, 15 going on 16. \n\nWhen I was going on 6, my\
  \ parents would often remind of how a black man must be ready to go out into the\
  \ world. Be ready to carve his dreams and follow them, whatever shape or form they\
  \ may take. What they failed to mention was that, when the time comes they will\
  \ have to be the first obstacle I will have to overcome. The same people who saw\
  \ potential in me, the same people who said I should follow my dreams no matter.\
  \ Were the same people to shoot my dreams down, because they didn\u2019t see my\
  \ their worth. \n\nMy hard lesson in life came when I was developed a love for basketball.\
  \ Coming from a black family that loved soccer, they never understood my obsession\
  \ for it. The fact that basketball was a new sport in South Africa at the time didn\u2019\
  t help my case at all. There were no notable Icons I could refer to, except the\
  \ one\u2019s I use to see on the televised games of course. But who was I kidding,\
  \ my parents didn\u2019t know those people, so it was like talking to brick walls\
  \ in a different language. \n\nThey didn\u2019t know even Michael Jordan, now try\
  \ explaining who Magic Johnson is? Or Iverson? Or who Shack O\u2019Neil is to the\
  \ game? Things got worse when my game times were on the same day as church. This\
  \ didn\u2019t sit well with my mom as she would have preferred me wearing a black\
  \ suit and joining her for a peaceful church service instead.\n\nUnfortunately I\
  \ had fallen in love with art of ball playing. It was like breathing and nothing\
  \ else mattered. We would travel weekly to different venues, the action packed sport\
  \ centers were something new to me. Every weekend meeting new faces, making friends\
  \ and creating rivals all at the same time. I was introduced to a whole new world.\
  \ But I loved it, and even the disapproval of my family I told myself I will fight\
  \ for it. After all, this is what they taught me, to stand for something or fall\
  \ for anything. \n\nMy minds were in a state, they were in a debate, they didn\u2019\
  t know if I wanted to be the type of man who lets his parents define his dreams\
  \ for him or the type that does the defining. I had to make an important decision\
  \ and I choose to be the author of my life from that moment on."
