Text: "It is with surgical precision that the director of photography highlights the\
  \ scene in which the main characters' eyes will accidentally meet for the first\
  \ time. Somehow, the audience will feel that the story gets to a crossroads. In\
  \ life, though, no director is ever there to emphasize that unforgettable something\
  \ that is about to happen. OK, there's memory, but by definition it doesn't work\
  \ in real time. As if that wasn't enough, it's not even reliable and it exaggerates\
  \ more often than not. A chance encounter, especially if it takes place on a lazy\
  \ afternoon and without much expectation, is sure to be later embellished in memories.\n\
  \nEyes meeting for the first time, we were saying... When ours ran into each other's,\
  \ winter was nearing its end. In spite of the season changing, the bitter cold still\
  \ descended on the footpaths of Manang from the peaks of the Annapurna massif. The\
  \ shopkeeper had reluctantly reopened his little grocery shop after what had likely\
  \ been a nice lunch \u2014 if the roundness of his belly can be considered an evidence\
  \ of past similar sins \u2014 followed by a most likely sleep of the just \u2014\
  \ if his shaky eyelids can be considered a valid indication.\n\nThe first approach\
  \ was mine, and it couldn't have been otherwise. You were blessed with the graceful\
  \ halo of who doesn't seem to notice the lives of the others passing by. And I...\
  \ I must have had the look of despair of someone in need of a disposable miracle.\n\
  I always thought that traveling companions sharing something memorable become brothers\
  \ in arms. And how could I forget the way you took care of me during that awful\
  \ food poisoning, getting in and out four rotten wooden planks poorly nailed together?\
  \ At an altitude of 3500 meters, we were en route towards the Thorong La pass, somewhere\
  \ almost 2000 meters above us.\n\nI was alone in a foreign land, but you always\
  \ protected my back, especially when those who were supposed to be there instead\
  \ of you were absent without leave. You knew how to cheer me up. And by a strange\
  \ twist of fate, you had become my little picture of Dorian Gray: suffering my indispositions,\
  \ visibly losing weight.\nAnd then it happened. Our promised land was finally within\
  \ grasp but you, would-be Moses, passed away the night before we could reach it!\
  \ You did it your way, still trying your best to help me. In your last hour, you\
  \ had my back for the dozenth time. The moment of a heartfelt goodbye had eventually\
  \ come.\n\nI salute you, my loyal roll of toilet paper!"
