Text: "The savage winds of a hurricane that seemed like a motion-picture postcard\
  \ from the view of the airplane window. In a giant capsule of metal, filled with\
  \ oxygen and fuel, I sat with my family as we watched the foreshadowing of what\
  \ our fates would have been like, if we had chosen to stay in the beloved country\
  \ of my mother- Venezuela. I was young when my mother wanted all of us to experience\
  \ the glory of her country. She described it as a place of people overflowing with\
  \ happiness, a land embedded with wealth and richness (like petroleum and mines),\
  \ and a place where extreme value lays in the well-being of la familia. Her words\
  \ and her love for her country were the perfectly fitted brochure for our family.\
  \ We packed our bags and set off. A lingering, suppressed voltage of desire stirred\
  \ in the midst of us, but none stronger than what my mother wanted to establish\
  \ in our hearts- a strong connection with the little piece of the world she wanted\
  \ to call home again. We arrived in Caracas, Venezuela. The capital and largest\
  \ city. A place filled with loud, joyous people; a brawny mountain range that practically\
  \ surrounded it; and the scuttle of city noises.  We stayed with relatives, slept\
  \ in a room filled with hammocks (I called the top one), and ate their typical local\
  \ foods (empanadas, cachapas, arepas, etc). From there, we traveled to Maracaibo,\
  \ the second largest city and where my mother was born and raised. Our little voyage\
  \ to Maracaibo was spent in the bed of an enclosed truck with four, long and slim,\
  \ rectangular windows and no A.C. Now you have to imagine that in a country pretty\
  \ close to the equator, traveling in the middle of the day, to a city that holds\
  \ a lot of petroleum. Yeah, plain and simple, I said my prayers in the bed of that\
  \ truck, heaving into a brown paper bag. I thought that simple crossing would be\
  \ the end of all of my imagined explorations. But, it wasn\u2019t, my adventures\
  \ continued carrying loads of luggage up seven flights of stairs, waking up at four\
  \ in the morning to take cold showers, getting bit in the ear by a spider while\
  \ I slept, becoming dehydrated, and my sister partially getting dragged under a\
  \ bus by one of my uncle\u2019s chained dogs on his ranch. Other than that, I got\
  \ to see and experience the world my mother knew. A home she missed. As I sat in\
  \ my plane seat, I realized that my mom did get what she hoped for in a way- our\
  \ stronger connection to the little piece of the world she held in her heart. A\
  \ connection local to me."
