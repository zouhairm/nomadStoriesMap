Text: "It was spring time when I and my friends decided to go in a road trip, with\
  \ wonderful places chosen in the north of Spain and France. Surf and travel as much\
  \ as possible was our goal, but we didn\u2019t imagine that the road were about\
  \ to gain a new way.\n\nParting from Porto our first stop was in Playa de las Catedrales,\
  \ one of the best beaches in the world, where I was amazed seeing the rocks in form\
  \ of cathedrals, dolphins crossing around and the clear waves calling us to surf.\
  \ What a wonderful place.\nWe traveled all over the north of Spain and France to\
  \ see the best beaches. We were running from place to place to enjoy as much as\
  \ possible. But there was something missing, we wanted something more, that full\
  \ fill this amazing trip.\nSo we went to Pyrenees of France and we climbed the biggest\
  \ mountain, Pic Du Midi. But that was not as easy as we thought and we started to\
  \ thinking in go back. Just at the beginning of our trip in Pyrenees a wild goat\
  \ crossed in front of our car, we were lucky enough to stop on time.  Then, as we\
  \ climbed the Pic Du Midi, a huge fog appeared and we could not see anything, no\
  \ one, everything was white all around us.  \nWe were scared and thought to go back,\
  \ but one pulls another and we reached the top. What a wonderful view above the\
  \ soft white clouds that look like cotton, wonderful sun after the storm, we rest\
  \ and enjoy this natural beauty.\nThen, back on the road a special place was in\
  \ our way, where the unexpected happen. \n\nThe most quiet, simple and peaceful\
  \ place turns out to be the most striking of the trip.\nAnd why? Because we finally\
  \ calm our breathing, we learn how to calm the heart and really stay in the moment.\n\
  We sit down in the cave of Our Lady of Lourdes, hearing the river that passes by,\
  \ feeling the cold breeze, seeing the beauty of that place that we were in, and\
  \ how mystic that was. We humbly enjoyed the peace that was felt in our hearts.\n\
  What made this moment even more special was that we were with a priest  who had\
  \ such a peaceful look and transmitted love.  This priest also talked about the\
  \ importance of the path and not just the destination, he spoke about the importance\
  \ of every little moment and not just our high moments.\nHe had such wisdom, such\
  \ ability to savor every moment of life, that we get the desire to live this way.\n\
  \nThis transformed our life, every moment in the road back home was more mean full\
  \ and let the desire of live to the fullest each moment of our lives."
