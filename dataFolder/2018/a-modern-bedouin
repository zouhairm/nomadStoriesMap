Text: "One by one stars punctured the ink black sky as my new friend hurriedly set\
  \ up camp. He rolled out an intricate hand-woven rug and carefully arranged local\
  \ delicacies of dried dates and pistachios. The glow of the campfire flickered across\
  \ his face revealing his kohl-lined eyes sharp and piercing from under his perfectly\
  \ assembled red and white checkered keffiyeh. Refilling my cup of mint tea, he embodied\
  \ an ancient custom that stretched back through centuries. Revered as an honor,\
  \ Bedouin hospitality is still a sacred duty.\n\nAwad. He introduced himself at\
  \ the Wadi Rum Visitor Center after being assigned as my personal tour guide. We\
  \ had spent the day exploring the canyon where Lawrence of Arabia took refuge during\
  \ World War I and searching for the Arabian Ibex. So when he politely invited me\
  \ to experience a traditional Bedouin night \u201Cfree of charge\u201D, I didn\u2019\
  t hesitate. In the vast and calloused landscape of the desert where commodities\
  \ are few, tradition becomes religion. \n\nIn between the soothing gurgle of the\
  \ water pipe and the belching of thick white smoke with every exhale, the two of\
  \ us talked for hours. Awad proudly spoke of his nomadic roots and how his people\
  \ were fierce and frugal explorers. The stillness of the night was disrupted only\
  \ by the ethereal cries of traditional bedouin music emanating from his new iPhone.\
  \ \n\nHe continued on about life in his village, a sedentary encampment just beyond\
  \ the mountain. Never having left the confines of the desert, explorers now come\
  \ to him. Refilling my cup of tea, he adjusted his headlamp, a recent gift from\
  \ a German climber. \n\n\u201CMiss, would you like to see the stars?\u201D\n\nAwad\
  \ took my hand as he guided me up a steep dune, away from the glare of the fire.\
  \ My thighs burned with every step as the soft sand shifted beneath my feet. At\
  \ the top, the sky opened up exposing a celestial blanket of constellations. His\
  \ hand, still clammy and clumsily placed in mine, he asked \u201Cwith permission\
  \ may I keep holding your hand? It\u2019s just that I have never been alone with\
  \ a girl.\u201D\n\nThe awkwardness of his stuttering question was not lost on me.\
  \ Customarily, it was a cultural taboo for us to be touching. As we stood there\
  \ hand-in-hand, heads cocked towards the sky, I could feel his smile radiating in\
  \ the dark. Perhaps, everything in the desert must adapt to survive, even cultures\
  \ enthralled in tradition. Just like the sand dunes that dot their ancestral lands,\
  \ they shift. Grain by grain, hand by hand."
