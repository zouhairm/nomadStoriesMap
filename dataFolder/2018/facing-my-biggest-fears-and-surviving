Text: 'Last year I traveled to Africa all of sudden.

  As most part of the Africa I knew was the one shown in the movies, I decided to
  change a little bit and face the wild, camping all by myself and having as company
  the courage and hope.

  It was amazing to climb trees that looked like they were as high as my dreams, but
  my dreams are limiteless, so I tried to connect to the animals known by their fierce
  as tigers and elephants and we became real friends. I taught th some tricks and
  they taught me how to be simple and to admire the purest beauty, to breath and feel
  you''re already lucky to be there, to be you.

  I climbed some high mountains and used my dreams as a pair of crutch. I felt thirty,
  but not any thirsty, I felt thirsty of wisdom to know a little more abou that culture.

  I met some people that changed my life just by the wat they glance at something
  wanting so much to learn it, to be good at it and giving everything they had to
  be the best!

  I learnt new languages, the language of love, of culture, of wisdom, of hope. And
  I learnt to dream.

  Maybe I learnt so much to dream that none of this is really true but my willing
  to travel the world and to travel to Argentina to learn to write a little bit better.
  My imagination goes everywhere, without a passaport or a ticket, but I have this
  feeling that if I live the moments maybe I can describe then better and finally
  write about one adventure so indescriptable that I''ll not only write but let my
  feelings do that for me.'
