Text: "I\u2019m not sure where the landslide began. Maybe it was the thought about\
  \ leaving the country? Maybe it was the decision to budget and make leaving the\
  \ country possible? Or, the last step I left in LAX as I boarded my flight to \u2018\
  El Distrito Federal\u2019 otherwise known as Mexico City. \nThe first weekend I\
  \ spent in Mexico had already been arranged by my cousin. Angelique (born and raised\
  \ in Mexico City) wanted me to join her on a trip to San Luis Potosi. Little did\
  \ I know agreeing to join her meant catching a red eye van filled with fourteen\
  \ people and traversing six hours through pot holes galore as the city flew by while\
  \ the sights of rural trees encroached. Not forgetting the frequent stops for servesas\
  \ along the way. It was 4 o\u2019clock somewhere, right? \nThe van stopped outside\
  \ of a hardy standing stick and leaves structure where we were grabbing breakfast.\
  \ I looked around absorbing the most simple village I had ever encountered. The\
  \ main form of transportation within the village seemed to be dirt bikes heavy with\
  \ several young kids packed on top. \nIt was quite obvious I was the odd one out.\
  \ My Spanish speaking abilities dibbed me as \u201Cgringa\u201D immediately. \n\
  After finishing breakfast, everyone in the group began changing into their swim\
  \ apparel. I still had no idea what the game plan was but I stood in line for the\
  \ outdoor bathrooms. I used water from the streams beside it to flush the toilet.\
  \ I had so many questions but I\u2019m a sucker for spontaneity. The group gathered\
  \ and got back into the van. Which drove another 60 minutes on a dirt path that\
  \ ended at a barbed wire fence. I followed behind our guide as we walked another\
  \ 10 minutes through what seemed to be farm land scattered with cow pies trailing\
  \ our path and thin cattle blankly blinking as this herd of humans passed by. \n\
  Eager to see what was at the end of this trail I walked quickly next to our guide.\
  \ I noticed the path seemed to drop off as wooden fences tapered alongside us. I\
  \ heard the rush of water and echoes of laughter coming up from somewhere below.\
  \ My excitement fueling curiosity. Our guide led us up to a fence and continued\
  \ to climb through it. A couple steps passed that he led us to a literal cliff edge\
  \ and dove in head first. Thirty three feet was our first jump, easy. The group\
  \ started chanting, \u201Cgringa\u201D over and over again until I stared down into\
  \ the murky navy water. I took in a deep breath and calmly stepped off the edge."
