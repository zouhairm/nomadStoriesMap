Text: "I spent my first summer here in 2005. I remember feeling amazed, and telling\
  \ myself that I wished I\u2019d lived in such a beautiful place. I decided I would\
  \ find my new beginning in Paris. Now my life is here, in Paris. I\u2019m a photographer\
  \ and art historian working in a museum with an enormous collection. \nEvery day\
  \ thousands of tourists gather from across the world, speaking different languages\
  \ and sharing their cultures, to see the wealth of art, history, and knowledge present\
  \ at the Louvre. \n\nThe day was July 12th. My day began at the Italian paintings,\
  \ just outside of the room with the Mona Lisa. People rarely ask about the other\
  \ works; when it happened that he did just that, I was surprised. \nLater that day\
  \ I was working in the stunningly empty gallery of European sculptures from the\
  \ late Middle Ages. And there he was again! That curious visitor, so focused on\
  \ what he was scribbling in his notebook. He saw me and smiled. We talked. His name\
  \ was Vincent. I laughed, because coincidently Vincent is my last name. He was visiting\
  \ and wanted to know more about my city. \n\nIt made me remember 2005, when I visited\
  \ the city alone. I imagined the wonder like my own he must have felt, crossing\
  \ Europe, seeing new things, hearing new languages. \u201CWhat are you doing Saturday?\u201D\
  \ I asked him. We went to an exhibition then walked through Saint-Michel. We had\
  \ a falafel and talked through the Parisian Summer night. It was his last night\
  \ in Paris. He was staying near Gare de l\u2019Est, so I took the metro with him.\
  \ He hugged me like he\u2019d known me for years. When I left I wanted to turn back,\
  \ to spend hours with him, but I continued home. \n\nAfter that, though, we still\
  \ talk every day, sharing beautiful moments and stories with one another. He sent\
  \ me everything from his trip to Toulouse, then Barcelona, then from Split. At each\
  \ point, he invited me to join but each time I rejected him. One morning I knew\
  \ I had to see him. I took a plane to Budapest. This was just the beginning of the\
  \ beginning. Three weeks later we found each other in Playa del Carmen. We spend\
  \ December in LA, San Diego and Las Vegas. In March, I saw him in New York City.\
  \ And so we continue. \n\nEvery time you say goodbye to someone you love it is difficult.\
  \ You meet at airports but then get on planes going different ways. I know I want\
  \ to see him. I want to share these beautiful moments and discover everything with\
  \ him. Here\u2019s to new beginnings."
