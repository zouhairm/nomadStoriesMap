Text: "A hellish squawking fills the air \u2013 a combination of demented guttural\
  \ croaks and quacks, like Donald Duck with a bad hangover. If dragons existed they\u2019\
  d probably sound something like this. But you\u2019d never expect to find them here:\
  \ a stone\u2019s throw from the giant feet of Shanghai\u2019s Oriental Pearl Tower,\
  \ in a pocket park. I\u2019ve set out to explore Shanghai with my ears instead of\
  \ my eyes. Tourists throng around Pudong\u2019s iconic monument to new China, but\
  \ a short walk away I\u2019ve got the place to myself. Standing carefully in the\
  \ shelter of a small pagoda - the pathways around me are covered in bird shit which\
  \ rains down with regularity \u2013 I enjoy the cackling pterodactyl-like cacophony\
  \ floating from the trees. \n\nSearching out unique soundscapes, like Shanghai\u2019\
  s miniature modern dragons, can add a whole new dimension to familiar travel destinations\
  \ - and reveal a whole world of new ones. Bypassing multi-story shopping malls I\
  \ head next for the modest Wanshang bird and insect market. Stepping inside I\u2019\
  m plunged into air that pulsates with calls from hundreds of song birds and thousands\
  \ of crickets. Then I take the metro to Lu Xun Park where any day of the week there\u2019\
  s free all-you-can-hear audio dim sum, from novices noodling on saxophones to accomplished\
  \ erhu players. If you\u2019re lucky you might even find a sheng. An ancient wind\
  \ instrument that looks like the player\u2019s taking a hit off a bong embellished\
  \ with bicycle horns to produce weird wavering chords, that blend with bubbling\
  \ bird song rising from the trees.\n\nTo end my day of sonic exploration I drop\
  \ in at the historic Peace Hotel to catch a set from a famously old jazz band (average\
  \ age: 80). Avoiding the hefty cover charge, I linger in the palatial marbled lobby\
  \ where the tunes drift like smoke along vast art deco hallways, evoking the city\u2019\
  s opium-fueled 1920s heyday. \n\nWalking back to my hotel the city traffic replete\
  \ with buzzing electric bikes and scooters don\u2019t sound like noise anymore.\
  \ It morphs into a wave-like constantly evolving multi-track mix. As I cross the\
  \ Yan\u2019An freeway the tires of rush hour cars make loud double thuds on the\
  \ overpass inches above by head \u2013 a giant pulse. I close my eyes and experience\
  \ the heartbeat of this giant dragon of a city."
