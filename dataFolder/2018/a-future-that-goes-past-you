Text: "\"Do step in, this is a public garden,\" urged the old man who stood trimming\
  \ the hedge. The little church towering over the very pretty garden made us all\
  \ look smaller. I was led to a stone bench and a wooden statue of Aslan the Lion.\
  \ A spirit of making friends with the strange other world gripped me. I went up\
  \ to the old man and asked: \"I am here for some days. Do you think I could help\
  \ you with the garden?\" \n\nIt was answered by an offer of friendship from the\
  \ entire parish. Donald, the old man and his wife were to be my first patrons. Marian,\
  \ witty and nimble, wore a bright red sweater to the Church the next Sunday. \"\
  Donald is blind you see\" she said. \"This even he would be able to spot\", I replied.\
  \ Old and beginning to get blind, they could tell how I groped my way around the\
  \ layers of history in Edinburgh. Marian was a priest who spent her youth in England.\
  \ The couple shifted to Aberdeen at least half a century ago. That year, Scotland\
  \ was preparing for its historic referendum on whether to leave the United Kingdom.\
  \ \"We are at home both in England and Scotland. We could never bear leaving the\
  \ UK.\" Marian said. \"UK OK\", said Donald, as he showed me how to deal with a\
  \ tree that seemed to have shed a whole autumn from its days.\n\nHaving no living\
  \ memories of my own country's partition, which still bleeds, I was able to look\
  \ on idly like a pigeon watching the geese and swans fighting for bread-crumbs in\
  \ a park-lake. \n\nI worked the garden with Morag the next weekend.  I remembered\
  \ to remember the dark, soft soil. A song in Malayalam that meant 'until you work\
  \ the earth, it doesn't belong to you' kept coming to me. Morag and Robin were a\
  \ widely travelled, sophisticated pair. \"This is a stronghold of the Scottish Nationalist\
  \ Party\", they said of the house they invited me into. The word 'nationalist' was\
  \ misleading, I thought. Back in India, nationalism was soon becoming a synonym\
  \ for discrimination and exclusion. I was gladly proven wrong. They told me of the\
  \ Burn's supper of the year before. It was a man from Pakistan who proposed the\
  \ 'toast to the Haggis'. Morag gave me stickers that said 'yes' to the referendum.\n\
  \nThe pain of wanting to leave and stay all at once cannot be strange to travellers.\
  \ What when the next turn is to a totally different future? How many centuries do\
  \ you take along and how many do you leave behind? \n\nLooking back, it is strange\
  \ that I envied the robust patch of thistle plants in Morag's garden, though it\
  \ was not to bloom anytime soon."
