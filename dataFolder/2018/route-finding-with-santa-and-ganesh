Text: "Two days before my departure to Katmandu, Nepal, I learned that a segment of\
  \ my flight had been canceled entirely\u2014vanished from my flight itinerary as\
  \ if it had never existed.\n\nI spent my night of travel purgatory watching Ballywood\
  \ music videos in a Bangledesh airport. Almost 30 hours later, I landed in Katmandu\
  \ just as the sun was setting and took a shuttle to my hostel. \n\nThe driver explained\
  \ why the city was glowing strings of candy-colored lights: It was Tihar. Nepal\
  \ was celebrating the divine attachment among humans and between humans and animals.\n\
  \nI checked into my hostel and wandered out into the night. Smells of dirty vehicle\
  \ exhaust, spicy street food and ripening trash greeted me, all of it infused with\
  \ the holy smell of incense. Garlands of marigold hung from entryways and groups\
  \ of excited teenagers lit butter lamps.\n\nAn hour into my rambling exploration,\
  \ a 12-year-old boy with outstanding English asked where I was from. My name is\
  \ Sajit, he said, and asked if I wanted to sing songs with him and his friends.\
  \ It\u2019s like trick-or-treating, he said; we sing outside shops and the owners\
  \ come out and give us sweets or rupees. \n\nWithin the week, I would meet Sajit\u2019\
  s mother, father, older sister, younger sister, grandfather, uncle and aunt before\
  \ joining a group of 20 adults in a 10-day trekking trip along the foothills of\
  \ the Annapurnas.\n\nOn the group\u2019s last full days together, I became so engrossed\
  \ while taking photos of the World Peace Pagoda that I lost track of the group.\
  \ They hiked down on a different trail than the one we\u2019d driven up. After traipsing\
  \ down to the lake, they glided across it in canoes and hopped into vans. I raced\
  \ down the mountain, sweating in the quickly darkening jungle and guessing which\
  \ way to go at each intersection. \n\nI found two men on mountain bikes also racing\
  \ the darkness. My name is Ganesh, one said. Hindus know the elephant-headed god\
  \ Ganesh as the the Lord of Good Fortune. My name is Santa, the other said, gamely\
  \ acknowledging the jolly Christmas character. \n\nTogether, Ganesh, Santa and I\
  \ found our way around Lake Fewa, following the light of their headlamps. On the\
  \ far side of the lake, they pointed me toward my hotel. Six hours after I\u2019\
  d seen them last, I found the group eating dessert in the hotel. We\u2019re glad\
  \ you\u2019re back, they said. Then an Australian woman gave me the greatest compliment\
  \ of my life. If anyone was going to get lost, I\u2019m glad it was you, she said.\
  \ I knew you\u2019d find your way back."
