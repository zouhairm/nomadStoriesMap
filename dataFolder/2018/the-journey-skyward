Text: "It was beautiful at first sight. The towering dark shadow among the brightest\
  \ of stars. Even more so, the pathway of lights shimmering along the distance signifying\
  \ that it was not only me who was undertaking this journey but many more. Mount\
  \ Batur was taunting me and I was determined to conquer it. Our guide, Kedrk, met\
  \ us at the base of the mountain and handing around flashlights he ushered us into\
  \ the beast.\nIt started along slowly, looking out for rocks and watching where\
  \ to step. But gaining altitude I could feel the nervous energy of others seeping\
  \ into me. \"Quickly, we have to see sunrise\" Kedrk urged with his broken english\
  \ and Balinese accent. My pace quickened. As time ticked closer to the countdown\
  \ for sunrise, a sense of urgency could be heard, be it in English, French or Bahasa.\
  \ My muscles ached but each step felt closer to reaching my destination. Then after\
  \ what seemed like hours I could see a throng of people milling about a small caf\xE9\
  \ selling coffee and sandwiches. \n\"This is it\" Kedrk said as we reached the platform.\
  \ I breathed out and a smile crept to my face until I saw a group of people going\
  \ further still. \"Where are they going?\" I asked Kedrk pointing to the up climbing\
  \ crowd. \"They going further,\" he said, \"To top of the mountain. Not for you.\
  \ Sunrise also good here.\"\nMy mind said no but I knew in my heart that I could\
  \ not miss it. \"I need to go there\", and even though I could see the disbelief\
  \ in his eyes, Kedrk led me further.\nIt got steeper as soon as we started but the\
  \ real trial was yet to come. \"Be careful, sand\" Kedrk warned as the terrain changed.\
  \ My shoes sunk into the sand and my pace slowed dramatically. Each step felt heavier\
  \ than the one before and halfway I could feel my spirit dwindling. I looked back\
  \ and the wide expanse I had climbed seemed frivolous. With  tears prickling the\
  \ corners of my eyes I turned forward to say I couldn't continue but Kedrk was right\
  \ there with an outstretched hand. \"You can't give up now\". In his eyes I saw\
  \ hope, the determination that I had lost. Holding his hand I realized he had my\
  \ decision for me. I was going to climb this mountain. Step by step I made my way\
  \ forward, not looking up or down. but when I did, we had stopped and I could see\
  \ the most beautiful thing I had ever seen. The clouds were parting and a soft orange\
  \ glow emitting from within. In under 2 minutes that was the most breath taking\
  \ sunrise I would ever see.\n\"Terima kasih\" I said to Kedrk with folded hands.\
  \ He smiled back"
