Text: "A sea of mist filled the mountain valleys. During the sunrise you could see\
  \ how magical this place was. You couldn\u2019t feel that you were standing there\
  \ with thousands of people. Everyone was enchanted by the place and silently looked\
  \ at the view. The light was emerging from the darkness and the calmness fulfilled\
  \ us.\nThe day before we had decided we would go on an adventure. 320 km road trip\
  \ on a motorcycle looked a bit scary for us - because neither of us had driven a\
  \ motorcycle before. But I suppose this is the reason why we choose to travel -\
  \ to experience something new. After a while we were driving on a motorcycle through\
  \ unknown Northern Thailand roads of Northern Thailand.\nWe were driving through\
  \ the mountain roads and admiring the mountain views. Every turn brought us something\
  \ new and surprised us each time.\nWe reached our goal after travelling for a full\
  \ day. We were standing on top of 1,6 km Phu Chi Fa mountain peak during the sunset.\
  \ We were tired, but the the beauty of it filled us with new energy.\nSteep mountain\
  \ cliffs go all the way to Laos border, and we saw grand Mekong river in a distance\
  \ and nothing else in the entire world could compare to it. This place had already\
  \ enchanted us and I couldn\u2019t imagine what it would  bring in the morning.\n\
  Next morning started with the climb to the mountain. We were walking through the\
  \ forest road, but we could tell the crowd was getting bigger. But only after we\
  \ came out of the forest we saw thousands of lights on the mountain. In that moment\
  \ we knew there will be a lot of spectators.\nEveryone silently found the best spots\
  \ to enjoy the view. People moved only when they wanted to get warm. It was only\
  \ fifteen degrees! That felt extremely uncomfortable for the body in Thailand.\n\
  The stars started to fade away slowly letting the mist of clouds to take their place.\
  \ It seemed like the mist covered all the mountain valleys which we saw so clearly\
  \ the other day. The thick clouds layer covered the lights of the Laotians village\
  \ and the spectacle that we all came here for started. \nThe clouds were whirling\
  \ in the sky. The sunlight tried to go beyond the clouds, but all we saw was the\
  \ red horizon. We all watched it impatiently and silently. The sea of clouds is\
  \ one of those rare things you can see in only a few places in the world. We felt\
  \ like that moment was given only for us. After the sun rose people were gone within\
  \ minutes, but we were sure thousands of people can\u2019t overcome the beauty of\
  \ nature."
