Text: "I stared at the two orange tickets in my hand, each with a number written on\
  \ it in green\u201411 & 52\u2014handed to me by a stranger. I was taking a gamble\
  \ and I was starting to believe that it wasn\u2019t going to pay off.\_\n\_\nI took\
  \ a look around. Ed and I had come to Austin for a quick getaway, and\_he was indulging\
  \ my need to find a quirky, hidden gem in the city. I had convinced him to follow\
  \ me to Ginny\u2019s Little Longhorn Saloon, where we were sitting on plastic lawn\
  \ chairs in the parking lot, just a few feet from a dumpster and porta-potty, slowly\
  \ losing our will to live in Austin\u2019s sweltering heat. He wasn\u2019t saying\
  \ much; I couldn't tell if he was annoyed at being pulled into another of my questionable\
  \ exploits, or if he was silently suffering because he\u2019d overindulged at Torchy\u2019\
  s Tacos.\_\n\_\nI glanced back over to the group of people bustling around a chicken\
  \ coop in the middle of the parking lot. They were emitting cries of excitement,\
  \ followed by huge sighs of disappointment. I had walked away from them just moments\
  \ before, the excitement and boredom combining to take their toll.\n\_\n\u201CLet\u2019\
  s just go,\u201D I said. \u201CThere\u2019s no chance it\u2019s going to be me.\u201D\
  \ I suggested we head to the State Capitol to check off at least one touristy \u2018\
  must\u2019. But Ed insisted we wait. He settled back into his chair, refusing to\
  \ admit his food coma was responsible for keeping us in place, melting in the heat.\_\
  \n\_\nMinutes later a much louder roar erupted from the direction of the chicken\
  \ coop. Ed had fallen asleep so I headed back to the crowd and jostled my way to\
  \ the front. My eyes zoomed in on the floor of the coop, scanning the square grid\
  \ of numbers for 11 and 52.\_\n\_\nThen I spotted it. A huge piece of chicken poop\
  \ dumped right between the two ones that made up the number 11. I edged my way in\
  \ a little closer, trying to make eye contact with the chicken I had built my hopes\
  \ and dreams upon\u2014at the going rate of $5 per ticket. A Ginny\u2019s employee\
  \ reached in and lovingly scooped up the chicken, shouting over the crowd, \u201C\
  Number 11 is the winner!\u201D\_\n\_\n\u201CThat\u2019s me\u201D, I said quietly.\
  \ Then cheering loudly with game show contestant levels of enthusiasm, \u201CI have\
  \ number 11!\u201D\n\_\n\u201CCongrats hon, you won.\u201D\n\_\nI was in a state\
  \ of thrilled disbelief (as was Ed, once awake). Going off the beaten path had paid\
  \ off. Armed with the $300 prize money and the honourable title, Winner of Chicken\
  \ Shit Bingo, we headed out to feast at Austin\u2019s infamous food trucks ready\
  \ to slip into our next food coma."
