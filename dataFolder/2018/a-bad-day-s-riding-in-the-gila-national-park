Text: "By this stage of the America tour, I\u2019d become a pretty experienced rider,\
  \ with \u2018Blondie\u2019 and myself  developing a close bond over the 20,000+\
  \ kms we\u2019d travelled so far. Little did I know when I woke up this morning,\
  \ that our friendship would be pushed to the limits. Somewhere between the towns\
  \ of Apache and Reserve in New Mexico, I\u2019d decided to take a short cut that\
  \ had shown up on my GPS. This looked to shave a huge chunk off the route I was\
  \ taken and as I rode along, I wasn\u2019t too worried when I saw a sign that advised\
  \ \u2018unmaintained tarseal ahead\u2019.\n\nNow I must explain that \u2018Blondie\u2019\
  \ is a 2002 BMW GSA 1150 motorcycle, who was not only carrying me and full pannier/\
  \ top box set up but also a reasonable motorcycle trailer, that was carrying food,\
  \ water, multiple books and rock samples, as well as many other items. I\u2019d\
  \ started in Vancouver, BC and had ridden from West to East to South and was now\
  \ heading back West towards AZ. I\u2019d started this day in Socorro, a lovely sunny\
  \ morning, just like many of the others along this trip, little realising that this\
  \ was going to turn into one of the worst days of the trip.\n\nI'd chosen to ride\
  \ through the Gila National Park, not realising it included a mountain range, flash\
  \ flood scoured trails, 4wd only logging tracks and watercrossings. This ride pushed\
  \ me to the limit and by the end I was battered, bloodied, bruised, de-hydrated\
  \ and starting hallucinate.\n\nI thought I was taking a short cut but it turned\
  \ out to be anything but, as almost 70-80 miles off road, from jarring wash board\
  \ gravel surface, pot holes, to bare rock, this had it all and combined with the\
  \ fact that I'd broken an axle off the trailer previously, made me wonder if I was\
  \ ever going to get everything out in one piece.  \n\nIt was just punishing, riding\
  \ mostly standing up due to not being able to see the road surface clearly sitting\
  \ down, the stress on the wrists, knees and all the muscles in between, was just\
  \ unrelenting.\nNow I'd ridden a bit up to this stage but this was pushing me mentally\
  \ and physically to the limit.\n\nWhen I fell off the first time, I cursed, when\
  \ I fell off the second time, I could have cried.\n\nWith three more water crossings\
  \ to go, I was struggling to stay focused and hold the bike up right. But somehow\
  \ I managed it and finally reached the ghost town of Mogollon before reaching Silver\
  \ City, spending two days there due to the feeling of shock I felt from the Bad\
  \ Day's Riding in the Gila National Park."
