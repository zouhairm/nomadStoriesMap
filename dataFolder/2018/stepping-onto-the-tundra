Text: "Stepping out of the bush plane, the first thing I noticed was the spongey ground\
  \ and the smell of saltwater. There is nothing like the Arctic tundra. Mosses and\
  \ lichen grow in thick patches between rocks. Sprigs of bold, purple fireweed poke\
  \ through the shallow earth. This land, aptly named the \u201Cbarren lands\u201D\
  , was not actually as barren as I envisioned.\n\nI had just arrived in Arviat with\
  \ a team of architects and engineers. This was our last stop on a week-long trip\
  \ through Nunavut, Canada. On the surface, Arviat wasn\u2019t glamorous. The bumpy\
  \ dirt roads were lined with derelict homes and rundown businesses, a smattering\
  \ of well-kept office buildings and one relatively new school clad in metal panels\
  \ with large aluminum fish cascading down the west fa\xE7ade.\n\nThat evening I\
  \ grabbed my thickest sweatshirt, a fishing pole, and headed to the waterfront.\
  \ The water was still, barely a lap against the rocky beachfront. I clumsily stepped\
  \ around the remains of a large walrus flipper and perched on a large rock, taking\
  \ in the sight. My view was completely unobstructed. Trees don\u2019t grow here\
  \ and there is nothing to prevent the wind from tearing across the land, no shade\
  \ from the sun, no shelter from the elements.\n\nA group of young Inuit children\
  \ and a father were casting fishing lines into the water a few yards away. I tried\
  \ to emulate their casts and see what I could catch. The children occasionally glanced\
  \ in my direction, acutely aware that I was not local. After awhile, a young boy\
  \ teetered over the rocks to where I was standing and, while attempting to conceal\
  \ a grin, innocently asked if I was trying to catch fish.\n\n\u201CYes,\u201D I\
  \ responded. \n\n\u201CHere,\u201D the boy replied. \u201CUgly fish.\u201D\n\nHe\
  \ was giggling as he brought his line forward to reveal a three-inch long fish with\
  \ green-grey scales and frilly orange gills that I later discovered to be a Sculpin.\
  \ I had a sneaking suspicion the boy was laughing at me, the stranger, and I couldn\u2019\
  t help but laugh in response. I meandered back over to the rest of his group and\
  \ we silently continued casting lines into the water.\n\n\u201CHow do you say \u201C\
  my name is\u201D in Inuktitut?\u201D I asked.\n\n\u201CUjunga,\u201D the man replied.\
  \ He patted himself on the chest. \u201CIt means \u201Cme am\u201D.\u201D\n\nWe\
  \ fell back into silence. It felt anything but empty. The silence provided space\
  \ to absorb the complexity of this place. No bright lights or grandiose architecture.\
  \ Just the water stretching endlessly before me, the tundra sprawling behind, and\
  \ the sky expanding in all directions."
