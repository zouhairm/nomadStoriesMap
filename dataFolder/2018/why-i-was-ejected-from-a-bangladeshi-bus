Text: "\u2018Out, out, OUT!\u2019\n\nIt took me 30 seconds to wake from my trance\
  \ and realise the shouting policeman was trying to get my attention. The policeman\
  \ with a rifle as long as his leg hanging off his belt! Assisted by my bus driver,\
  \ I quickly gathered my possessions and jumped out into a world of chaos and intense\
  \ stares.\n\nTrying desperately to get anything out of anyone in English, I was\
  \ totally confused. I\u2019d like to also say \u2018bemused\u2019, but the lurking\
  \ rifle countered much of the potential humour. But no one was arresting me or asking\
  \ for my passport. Just language barriers and brick walls. Stranded and helpless\
  \ at the roadside, halfway between Cox\u2019s Bazar and Teknaf, somewhere in the\
  \ coastal countryside of southern Bangladesh.\n\nUshered into the back office of\
  \ the bus station at which we\u2019d stopped, someone finally broke through in English:\
  \ \u2018they\u2019re trying to protect you\u2019, he whispered. Frightened by this\
  \ revelation, but also grateful for the unconditional protection of strangers, I\
  \ accepted a cup of tea and began chatting to my new friend. I was told that my\
  \ bus trip coincided with a third hartal in five days; a mass protest of seemingly\
  \ everybody, everywhere. Nobody working. Only throngs of angry people marching down\
  \ the streets, chanting for their cause. And setting fire to public transport.\n\
  \nAfter an hour of Bangladeshi-themed political small talk, the police chief for\
  \ the whole region arrived in the room with all the subtlety of an elephant running\
  \ through a picnic; suited and booted, and ready to spout his own back catalogue\
  \ of opinions on hartals and oblivious foreign travelers. Telling me he couldn\u2019\
  t guarantee my safe passage to Teknaf during a hartal, the chief confided that if\
  \ something happened to me, \u2018no one would come to Bangladesh anymore\u2019\
  .\n\nAfter concluding that a private car with two police guards would be outside\
  \ my daily budget, I gratefully accepted a lift back to Cox\u2019s Bazar on the\
  \ back of a police truck. Delivered personally to my hotel by the chief himself,\
  \ my accommodation came with a new rule. No leaving the hotel unless the chief gets\
  \ one hours\u2019 notice and a hotel employee chaperones me. House arrest.\n\nWith\
  \ my trip very quickly starting to look like a series of private-car shuttles between\
  \ hotels, I decided that Bangladesh would have to show me its jewels another time.\n\
  \nWhat a shame I couldn\u2019t leave my hotel or the streets around it, restricted\
  \ by the volatility of the minority. But when the volatility passes, take me back\
  \ already."
