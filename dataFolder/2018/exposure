Text: "I am Nitin who lives in India and in july 2017 i came to Malta for doing an\
  \ exchange programme in Malta as part of an MOU signed by both the countries.\n\
  I did 2 months  internship in Malta and in july it was too hot. I really cried why\
  \ i came in Malta as i am not able to enjoy, neither i am able to sleep nor i do\
  \ not know how to cook food. It was really difficult as i am pure vegetarian.\n\
  I did not give up and slowly i made few friends, by watching some youtube videos\
  \ i learned cooking. \nSometimes i prefer to travel alone during night and sit along\
  \ beach side.\n\nI travelled with my interns friends in gozo island. It was 15 minutes\
  \ drive from cruize.\nIt was really a great experience where i learned their culture,\
  \ religion etc.\n\nIn septemper my exchange programme started and their i meet up\
  \ with lot of friends. \nI travelled to 5 countries in first week of october . It\
  \ was a real experience and till december i travelled through 11 counties and i\
  \ started liking Malta and whole europe.\nI saw different infrastructure, meet new\
  \ people and it was really a  great experience for me.\nIt was worth it to came\
  \ to Malta and i wish that if i given a chance want to travel alone."
