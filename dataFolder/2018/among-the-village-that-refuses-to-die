Text: "She pulled me by my sleeve, uttering her native dialogue through her big grin\
  \ and animated hand gestures. With urgency, she began ordering the others to begin\
  \ the hosting arrangements. I sat down on her command and watched as she began cutting\
  \ up herbs and spices with ease; still bubbling with excitement for having us in\
  \ her home.\n\nAmazed, I looked around and like an antique photograph from the 1800s,\
  \ I saw smoke lifting up through straw huts, a donkey quenching its thirst in the\
  \ water cistern and a wide-eyed boy running joyfully on the dirty ground.\n\nA smiling\
  \ face pulled my attention back and handed me a \"quesadilla morada\" on a clay\
  \ plate. A \"quesadilla morada\" is a sought-after delicacy in Mexico. The tortilla\
  \ is made from purple corn, a variety of maize found only in Southern Mexico. \n\
  \nMy fingers touched the warm tortilla. The weight of its fillings was imminent.\
  \ I took it closer and took a gentle bite. And there it was. Like a movie scene\
  \ when the main lead finally realizes his \u2018why' and the stars in the story\
  \ align? I was in a native village, being served delicacies many would sacrifice\
  \ to taste. \n\nBut that wasn\u2019t all. This place was much more than a rare encounter.\
  \ \n\nI soon learned that 74 years ago, this village had been engulfed by lava.\
  \ The nearby volcano transformed the flourishing land into an uninhabitable terrain\
  \ overnight; misplacing the native community and branding them as refugees. Miraculously,\
  \ the only thing that remained was the cathedral. A real testament to the faith\
  \ of the local people. Today, the ruins can be explored. Their location is considered\
  \ sacred by locals. Their history, roots, and culture, lie within those very ruins.\
  \ \n\nOnly a few locals had chosen to relocate back after the eruption. They had\
  \ preserved their native tongue and way of life even though civilization resided\
  \ only 75 miles away. I wondered if anyone nearby knew the treasure living in this\
  \ land. \n\nI looked around once again. One last bite of the delicacy left on my\
  \ plate. I knew this was no ordinary place. I was sitting on the evidence of what\
  \ defines humanity's tenacity. \n\nSometimes, the places that hold the most meaning\
  \ are the ones you don\u2019t plan to go to. Unexpected encounters are what make\
  \ adventures unforgettable.\n\nThat day I learned that travel is not discovering\
  \ new destinations, it is embarking on a journey into the heart of humanity. And\
  \ that was surely the greatest discovery of all. \n\nThis was travel. This was humanity."
