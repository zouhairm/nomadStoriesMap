Text: "It was not the chorus of cab drivers shouting \u201CTaxi, Taxi\u201D that hijacked\
  \ all my senses; it was the smell of black tobacco, joined by Caribbean humidity\
  \ and over-saturated colors. Airport in Canc\xFAn stuns with fictional blue sky,\
  \ emerald-green palm trees, bleached white shirts and flaming red buses. Seems like\
  \ somebody is color correcting this place so that it matches the postcards, but\
  \ perhaps it\u2019s the way February dresses up, down in Mexico. \n\nEscape, was\
  \ the word all chain-smoker drivers used to lure me to see Chich\xE9n Itz\xE1, but\
  \ all I needed was a bus to Chiquil\xE1, where I could catch a ferry to my final\
  \ destination.  \n\nCamouflaged in the northern coast of the state, Quintana Roo,\
  \ Holbox (pronounced \u201Coll-bosh\u201D) is an island that stretches 26 miles\
  \ long, with over 3000 residents, turquoise waters, unpaved streets, flamingos,\
  \ pelicans, mosquitos, iguanas, seagulls and more mosquitos. It was discovered in\
  \ 1852, but due to hurricanes, settlers only moved here around 1970 when electricity\
  \ was introduced. Rumor has it that in mid 80ies a Colombian plane carrying illegal\
  \ drugs crashed on this island, causing loud disco music to become a thing. The\
  \ Island belongs to the protected Yum Balam reserve, so no Uber or cars in general\
  \ are allowed, most people bike or rent a golf cart.\n\nBut I was not there for\
  \ biking or competitive instagram photography, I was there for the annual euphoric\
  \ carnival. Once a year for three hypnotic days and equally memorable nights, island\
  \ transforms into a mesmerizing fiesta full of live music, Carmen Miranda inspired\
  \ costumes, taco truck cuisine and glitter everywhere. Nine groups compete by presenting\
  \ their best dance numbers sung and performed live. But it\u2019s more than just\
  \ empanadas with tequila, along the way; they elect the king and the queen of the\
  \ carnival. \n\nThere I was making a local connection on a street without a name,\
  \ next to a low-rise house without a number, taking pictures of a young father,\
  \ Alberto sewing a feathered wing to the dress of his daughter, while the mother\
  \ was hiding her tears of pride. \u201CIn Mexico we have a lot of pain\u201D confessed\
  \ Alberto, \u201CEven at a restaurant when it\u2019s time to pay, we say, bring\
  \ the pain\u201D \u2013 \u2018traiga la dolorosa\u2019 \u2013 \u201Cwe admire death,\
  \ but our desire to celebrate life is bigger, which is why carnival tradition is\
  \ so important.\u201D \n\nA day later, back in New York, gray clouds kept sending\
  \ snow, so I marveled, perhaps a bit of glitter with occasional smell of tobacco\
  \ is a benediction, after all."
