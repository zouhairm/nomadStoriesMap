Text: "\"Who run the world?:- GIRLS!... who run the world?:- GIRLS!\" :- we shout\
  \ along with Beyonce leaving behind our feminist agenda, human rights work and all\
  \ problems in the world... a nice hotel in the remote village on the shore of the\
  \ highest pure water lake in Europe is waiting for us to rock on our so-waited-as-deserved\
  \ vacation. \n\nThough it would last mere three days, but we have sworn to ourselves\
  \ to become \"normal human-beings\" switching off all our sensors and ideas on active\
  \ citizenship leaving  sole \"enjoy the moment\" button turned on. The lovely hotel\
  \ personnel welcoming and perspective of the lazy sunbathing at the largest lake\
  \ of Armenia cheers us up though a walk  from the hotel room to the restaurant lasts\
  \ 5 minutes  through the nearby village. \nTo our great pride we kept our promises\
  \ to not bother us with anything but lazy vacation and even made us to already miss\
  \ those moments of carelessness on our last walk to the restaurant, when a group\
  \ of teen-shepherds cross our path:- wow finally a nice chance to get a local connection.\n\
  \ \nThus we offer to call others from the village and especially women so we can\
  \ play some \u201C gender-diversified\u201D game\u2026. \n\n- We don\u2019t have\
  \ girls in our village:- is the answer to our offer making us to laugh at their\
  \ naive try to stay with us\u2026 \n- What? Not even a single? :- trying to \u201C\
  lawyer- up\u201D with interrogation and make all us laugh. \n- Yes, there single\
  \ girl in our village at our age\u2026. \n\nThe shock blocks off all the restrictions\
  \ imposed on my mind because of vacation and UN international reports with different\
  \ numbers are popping out in my mind 93000 \u2026 2060\u2026 114-100....In 2013,\
  \ the UNFPA sounded the alarm :-the sex ratio of the census population aged less\
  \ than 15 years outnumber female children by almost 39,000, while skewed sex-at-birth\
  \ rates will result in almost 93,000 \u201Cmissing\u201D women or gender gap by\
  \ 2060. The report stated that provinces like Gegharkunik where birth masculinity\
  \ is higher today than in China or in South Korea during the peak period .... and\
  \ we are in Gegharkunik... \n\n In the past, if the last child was a girl, she might\
  \ be named the Armenian word for \u201CEnough\u201D, as if no one could be bothered\
  \ to name her.  Sometimes it seems there are so many ways to destroy women that\
  \ the methods become invisible to us... but in this case there are some women you\
  \ will never name even \"Enough\"  because they are simply not born... \nThus, who\
  \ is left to run the world?"
