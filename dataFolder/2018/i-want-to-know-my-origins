Text: "Spain is the country where I was born. And where still I am. Nowadays I am\
  \ in the university, studying the law career.\n\nLast year I was living in London,\
  \ learning something of Englishman. And I know that my Englishman is not perfect,\
  \ but that experience was one of the best of my life. I love to travel, to visit\
  \ the museums, to speak with the people, to prove his eaten ones, and to learn to\
  \ elaborate, to listen to his accent them, to know new smells, new looks; One of\
  \ the things that I did on having finished my experience in London was to travel\
  \ in bicycle up to Paris. Several days in loneliness, thinking especially. It was\
  \ magic also. Of there, that is to say, from Paris, I returned to Spain by train.\
  \ This type of experiences changed my perception on many things. And since then\
  \ I do not stop thinking which will be the next adventure. \n\nMy name is Alberto\
  \ Sol\xEDs Gonzalez, I am 21 years old. And always I take with me a small diary\
  \ in which I write and annotate curious things. Aims. Things like that. I think\
  \ very much in the capacity that we have today to spread information through the\
  \ Internet, and networks. And I believe that can be really very useful, and of great\
  \ help. That is to say, I think that these experiences have also that to serve in\
  \ order that the people can know more. \n\nOne of the things that I learned in London,\
  \ and that more served me it was the importance of the family and the friends. I\
  \ was feeling very sad when at the end of month it was receiving my salary and it\
  \ it could not enjoy the people whom I love. There I learned what is the really\
  \ important thing. But also porqu\xE9 were important this class of trips. \n\nIn\
  \ the life, who never goes of his land, it is full of prejudices."
