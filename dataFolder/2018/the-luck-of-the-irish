Text: "On my most recent trip to Ireland I decided I would rent a car, but upon arriving\
  \ at Shannon Airport discovered that being 24 and 11 months was not close enough\
  \ to 25 to avoid paying a 30 euro fee per day that is tacked onto the normal price\
  \ of renting a car. I instead hitched a ride to the bus stop and from Limerick I\
  \ took the train to Cork. The annual Cork Jazz Festival was in full swing, a happy\
  \ coincidence as I wouldn\u2019t have been in Cork for the Festival if I had rented\
  \ a car. The Cork Jazz Festival was a wonderful experience that I would happily\
  \ plan to repeat. I spent my evenings wandering through the streets, and when I\
  \ heard something I liked ducked into packed bars so I could enjoy the music. \n\
  In one of the bars I met Betsy and Mary, a mother daughter duo. Mary, being my mother\u2019\
  s age was worried for my safety and made me promise that as a young woman I\u2019\
  d be careful, I pinkie swore that I\u2019d try. At the break in the set Mary asked,\
  \ \u201CCan you please just keep an eye on my mum while I have a fag?\u201D I laughed\
  \ and said yes and turning to Betsy shared a chocolate I\u2019d caught from the\
  \ singer during the show. The show continued, the singer standing on the bar while\
  \ singing \u201Cfly me to the moon\u201D, when the song ended I left the bar in\
  \ search of more Jazz.\n I happened upon James while walking toward a club, he was\
  \ leaning against a fence, watching the crowd while rolling a cigarette. I learnt\
  \ that he was waiting for his friends Cormac and Callum I asked if it was all right\
  \ if I waited with him, and in doing so invited myself along on a night of drinking.\
  \ They brought me to various bars on both sides of the river that cuts through Cork.\
  \ On one of our crossings Callum slung an arm across my shoulders, and I an arm\
  \ around his waist, stepping in time he taught me Gaelic numbers.\n\u201CA haon\u201D\
  \ Callum said, and then repeated. \u201CA haon,\u201D we shouted together. Each\
  \ time I got a number right we\u2019d take another step, and when I got it wrong\
  \ he\u2019d stop, repeat the number, and we\u2019d start from the beginning. \u201C\
  A haon, a d\xF3, a tr\xED, a ceathair, a c\xFAig,\u201D we chanted our way across\
  \ the River Lee far ahead of James and Cormac. I left the boys later in the early\
  \ hours in a dance club, and happily headed back to my hostel. \n The unexpected\
  \ things that have happened to me in Ireland have exposed me to experiences that\
  \ would have never happened if everything had gone to plan. Along the way of getting\
  \ to know myself I also got to see a side of Ireland that I\u2019ve never seen before."
