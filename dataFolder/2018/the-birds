Text: "There were enough birds for it to be considered Hitchcockian. In fact there\
  \ were more birds than I had ever seen in my life. They drifted above us like clouds,\
  \ blotting the sun from view. They covered every gnarled branch of every recumbent\
  \ tree that clung to the water\u2019s edge. They\u2026 you get the picture. Birds.\
  \ Lot\u2019s of birds. \n\n\u201CCreepy dinosaurs,\u201D Joel muttered, dismissing\
  \ 150-odd million years of evolutionary prowess in one breath. \n\n\u201CWell we\
  \ did come to Romania\u2019s preeminent bird watching region,\u201D I replied, waving\
  \ a plastic bird chart written only in Romanian at him, because I was the kind of\
  \ person who used words like preeminent in casual conversation and did too much\
  \ research into everything. \n\nAnd that\u2019s where we were; somewhere amidst\
  \ the brackish waters of the Danube delta, somewhere near the town of Tulcea, bird\
  \ watching. It had taken us one bus, two trains (though, one was more like a squat\
  \ communist cube on wheels with a top speed slower than my average walking pace),\
  \ three delays, one apathetic stranger (who appeared concerningly unconcerned at\
  \ us becoming trapped on afore mentioned train despite my \u2013 yes, Hitchcockian\
  \ - screaming and banging on the glass door to get out), and one home-grown apple\
  \ which Joel was forced to consume core and all to make it here from the capital.\
  \ The question persisted however, of why we were here at all. On one hand, we were\
  \ on our way to Moldova, where we had plans of being bowled over, but on the other\
  \ hand we both hated birds. Moreover, it was still winter, freezing, and thus not\
  \ even peak season for birds. \n\n\u201CYou mean there could be more?\u201D I asked,\
  \ not sure whether to be amazed or aghast. \n\nThe captain of our boat replied at\
  \ length in broken English, which Joel, now an expert in ambiguous eastern European\
  \ accents inferred to mean \u2018yes.\u2019 I nodded at him blankly, eyes blinking\
  \ against the biting wind, as I wrapped myself in an inexplicably tortilla-patterned\
  \ blanket, which over my lurid orange lifejacket had the cumulative effect of making\
  \ me look like a human burrito. \n\nThis fact gave Joel much joy. More joy than\
  \ the birds, despite how they were dancing in great moving canvases across the sky.\
  \ More joy even than the spectacularly bleak landscape all around us. Because, like\
  \ Hitchcock, ours wasn\u2019t really a story about dramatic scenes of creepy dinosaurs,\
  \ it was a story about something much more small and human.\n\nWe turned to each\
  \ other and smiled."
