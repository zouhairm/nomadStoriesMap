Text: "When people think of South Africa, most think of crime and corruption, but\
  \ one also thinks of Nobel Peace Prize winners such as Nelson Mandela and Desmond\
  \ Tutu. Apart from the political and social aspects captured by mainstream media,\
  \ there is so much more that South Africa has to offer. South Africa is a world\
  \ treasure as its picturesque mountains and wildlife boasts one of the best in the\
  \ world. So what makes South Africa so special?\n\nThe best experience you can have\
  \ in Africa, especially in South Africa is to live your life here like the locals.\
  \ Whether you're in Cape Town, Durban or Johannesburg there are so many ways to\
  \ live like a local. From braai's to parties to camping, South African locals love\
  \ to show people a great time. As a local, exploring and discovering the hidden\
  \ treasures of this country is an extremely rewarding experience. Mpumalanga has\
  \ green pastures of open land along mountain cliffs, caves with clear to murky natural\
  \ crystals. Gauteng has high development and beautiful cityscapes that have become\
  \ iconic. Kwa-Zulu Natal hosts one of the most prominent cultures, namely the Zulu's.\
  \ South Africa is a country with enormous possibilities!\n\nWhen I moved to Cape\
  \ Town for my studies I experienced Cape Town in an entirely different way, walking\
  \ along the warm sandy beaches of muizenberg, catching the aromas of freshly fried\
  \ fish and chips to sitting at a Chisa Nyama and smelling freshly prepared grilled\
  \ meats and having drinks with friends. Cape Town is a treasure on its own, hiking\
  \ the mountains of Lion's Head at sunrise to witness the beauty of an orange sun\
  \ rising over the Atlantic Ocean. It looks like something from the movies. When\
  \ living like a local on your trip, it is always important to have the food and\
  \ learn the customs and traditions of the people. As South Africa has 13 official\
  \ languages, all linked to the cultures this country hosts, a special place lies\
  \ in understanding that in South Africa, you're not alone. \n\nAs a people, South\
  \ African's are friendly and always willing to help, greeting you with a warm and\
  \ hearty smile and a laugh to match up to it, an experience in South Africa is unlike\
  \ any other. From having beers with locals, to going on brewery tours, walking the\
  \ streets of Maboneng or even taking it easy in one of our 21 South African National\
  \ Parks, there is always something for everyone. \n\nSouth Africa is not only what\
  \ people may see on the news but also a place of wonder and exploration, waiting\
  \ for you to come and experience it!"
