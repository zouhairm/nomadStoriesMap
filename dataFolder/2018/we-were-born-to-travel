  \ a lot,even in my daydreams and dreams. \n Actually, everybody thinks that I will\
  \ write about my realia travel story, but there I badly need your suggestions to\
  \ write my never happened travel story, but it happened with me. \n I live in far\
  \ of you, you will ask what does it mean. It mean, my motherland is Kyrgyzstan in\
  \ Central Asia,where had lived great nomad peaple. Furthermore, my story not about\
  \ it. \n In One day, I really tired and went to bed so late, that I forgot how I\
  \ transformed to sleep, but huge case was another, I was flying in my dreams over\
  \ the our Earth. I felt how fly up over the Earth, I felt that how I can see rivers,\
  \ different countries, even I can birth with air, later I saw our athmosphere  when\
  \ I flew away from ours Earth that was very great to me, but hook was that I saw\
  \ another planets, even I saw our Sun and beautiful stars, it was how realia, there\
  \ I was about 3-5 seconds,but expressions were as 3-5 hour, finelly, I wanted to\
  \ fly home to the Earth, where waited me future, my  siblings, where I am. The space\
  \ was as a time where frizen centurys' stories,space - is a place,where everybody\
  \  and everyhting find a hideaway. But, thing which one interested me everyday is\
  \ Where is situated our space. Does it have start and finish. Maybe, our space is\
  \ vacuum?Where somebody can see our lifetime...\n  I arrived my home,where so quiet\
