Text: "There were two Italians, a German, a Malaysian and a Mauritian on a trail in\
  \ the South of France. \nIt may sound like a joke or a funny story, but actually\
  \ that\u2019s how a big part of my travel stories begins.\nWe were walking on a\
  \ dirt track with small stones, surrounded by rocky mountains covered with bushy\
  \ stripes and tiny trees. We were looking for the sea, but it was nowhere to be\
  \ seen.\nThe more time passed away, the more the sun hammered down on our heads.\
  \ Since we didn\u2019t expect such a hike, we had heavy backpacks on our shoulders,\
  \ and we wore sandals and sneakers that made our steps clumsy and slippery.\nWe\
  \ were walking in silence and I was thinking about what had leaded us there. We\
  \ had arrived in Marseille the day before, and I was a little disappointed by what\
  \ I saw of the city. A chatty nice lady recommended us to go to the Calanque de\
  \ Sugiton. I was a little skeptical, since the sea and the beaches in the area didn\u2019\
  t seem that special, but we decided to give it a try.\nAfter half an hour the trail\
  \ became broader, the mountain on our left and a tiny stone wall on our right. We\
  \ walked around the corner and there was the sea, a little blue strip between the\
  \ mountains.\nReinvigorated by this view we kept walking down the slope, but the\
  \ trail became too steep and full of little stones for our completely inadequate\
  \ shoes.\nWe walked slowly, grasping for the bushes on the side of the trail as\
  \ we risked rolling down. After one last jump, we finally landed on the beach; we\
  \ got rid of our shoes, threw our backpacks in a corner and started undressing:\
  \ it was so hot we were dying to dive into the water!\nThe rush didn\u2019t last\
  \ that much because the water was so cold I felt my feet instantly freezing and\
  \ jumped away, safe on the stony beach. \nI stood there and took a while to admire\
  \ that piece of paradise around me. The water, so crystal clear I could see the\
  \ stones on the sea bed. The trees, clinging to the steep walls of the inlet. The\
  \ white rocks, reflecting on the water. Never would I ever have expected such beauty!\n\
  I closed my eyes and took a deep breath, enjoying the moment. Filling my lungs with\
  \ the smell of the sea. Feeling the sun on my skin and the tiny stones under my\
  \ naked feet. Listening to the little gentle waves and the splashes of people jumping\
  \ from the rocks.\nAnd then I opened my eyes and started walking towards the water,\
  \ I felt the freeze rising from my toes to my legs, to my waist. But I worked up\
  \ the courage and dove into that beautiful sea."
