Text: "It had been two weeks since I'd first stepped foot in the dusty, dizzying city\
  \ of Delhi and I finally had a day off to explore. So far, work had confined me\
  \ to a single, bustling block and I was eager for some quiet and greenery so I set\
  \ my course for a nearby garden. \nAs I walked, I kept my head down to avoid the\
  \ call of merchants and the unblinking gaze of curious strangers. I was an obvious\
  \ outsider in these streets and the watchful eyes of their rightful inhabitants\
  \ made me nervous. Learning a new culture is always fraught with faux-pas and I\
  \ prefered to make my mistakes as quietly as possible. Here, though, I was always\
  \ sticking out. \nMy first meal with my Indian co-workers, I had followed their\
  \ lead and forwent my fork -- shuffling biryani into my mouth with my hand but the\
  \ long grains of rice stuck to my fingers and only a few reached my tongue. \n\u201C\
  You\u2019ve never eaten with your hands before, have you?\u201D they\u2019d laughed.\
  \ \nWho knew it was so hard? I was shown how to scoop rice into the tip of my fingers\
  \ and use my thumb as a utensil to guide it past my lips. \nToday I was on my own.\
  \ \nHalfway to the garden, I stopped to rest in the shadow of a towering elephant\
  \ sculpture where Indian tourists were snapping portraits with their families and\
  \ friends. \nI thought about how many times I\u2019d sat watching similar scenes\
  \ in countries around the globe. These quiet, observant times were often the loneliest\
  \ parts of my travels - a reminder I had no one with me to share my experiences.\n\
  As I contemplated, a young girl approached me and held out her phone. \n\u201CPicture?\u201D\
  \ she said. \nI nodded and reached for her phone to snap a shot of her by the elephant\
  \ but she shook her head. \n\u201CPicture...\u201D she said again, pointing at me.\
  \ It took me a second to register what she was saying. She wanted to take a picture\
  \ with me - the fair-skinned foreigner. \nI looked around. Was this a trick? A joke?\
  \ \nPeople were staring, waiting to see what I\u2019d do, but their expressions\
  \ gave me no clue what was right.\nFinally, I made up my mind and stepped into the\
  \ girl's selfie. A smile erupted across her face. It made me smile too.\nClick.\
  \ \nBefore I knew it, I was surrounded by people asking me for pictures and wrapping\
  \ their arms around me. We made small talk in broken English and laughed like old\
  \ friends. Eventually, everyone moved on and I made my way to the garden, but I\
  \ held my head high as I walked. \nI\u2019d always tried my best to blend in, but\
  \ perhaps standing out was the less lonely course."
