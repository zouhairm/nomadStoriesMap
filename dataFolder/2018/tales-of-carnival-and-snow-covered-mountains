Text: "The Voralpen-Express is one of many scenic train routes in Switzerland, connecting\
  \ Lake Constance with Lucerne. It takes you through 149 km across the foothills\
  \ of the Alps, over 20 viaducts, bridges and tunnels.\n\nA sunny day in late March,\
  \ my journey starts in St. Gallen, after five hours meandering from Munich via the\
  \ Bavarian lakes, plains and peaks. In the next five days, I plan to visit Lucerne,\
  \ followed by Bern and Geneva, where I\u2019ll catch my flight back home. Here I\
  \ start to fulfil a childhood dream of travelling through Switzerland by train.\
  \ Venturing through scenery I\u2019d only glimpsed through photos, maps I\u2019\
  d been collecting since the age of ten and the wrapping on the chocolate I\u2019\
  d get as a gift from relatives visiting in the summer.\n\nGazing out of the window,\
  \ I barely notice time passing. Soon the forests give way to beautiful large lakes,\
  \ the hills dwarfed as mountains majestically peak over the valleys and the final\
  \ stop is announced \u2013 Lucerne, the very heart of the country.\n\nI speak a\
  \ few languages, but German is not one of them \u2013so, still at the train station,\
  \ I decide to ask a smiley lady for help with the next part of my journey. And so\
  \ I meet Nancy \u2013 a local health worker, who speaks quite good English.\n\n\
  What an encounter. We talk a bit more and walk together into the old town just a\
  \ few minutes away. It\u2019s a beautiful Saturday afternoon with a fresh mountain\
  \ air announcing spring and people enjoying the lakeside sun.\n\nWe stop for a coffee\
  \ at Theaterplatz next to the wooden Chapel Bridge, a part of the medieval city\
  \ wall dating back to the 14th century. The most important event of the year, the\
  \ \u201CFasnacht\u201D \u2013 Lucerne\u2019s centuries-old carnival \u2013 happens\
  \ right here in the old town, with its famous fountains and ornate, colourful facades.\
  \ In the crowded streets, demon like masked characters and loud music chase away\
  \ the spirits of winter and proudly celebrate tradition.\n\nNancy\u2019s enlivened\
  \ expression recalling the carnival goes dreamy as she tells me about her favourite\
  \ spot up on the mountain above the town, with a breath-taking view of Mount Pilatus\
  \ and the lake. Pilatus\u2019s peak reaches a staggering 2132m, with the steepest\
  \ cogwheel train in the world to the south in Alpnachstad, and plenty of activities\
  \ all year round, including the country\u2019s longest summer toboggan run.\n\n\
  Swiss beauty, hospitality and traditions conquered my heart right there. Nancy became\
  \ a friend and my journeys through Switzerland continue.\n\nThis is the very stuff\
  \ of dreams."
