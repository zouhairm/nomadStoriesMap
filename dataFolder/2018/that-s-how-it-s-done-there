Text: "I am there, being woken up at 5 in the morning, wearing wellingtons for the\
  \ first time, knowing that I have a day of demanding walking ahead\u2026\n-Want\
  \ one?\nThere we are! I should be still sleeping in my warm bed but I find myself\
  \ standing in the snow on the misty mountain passage at 6 in the morning getting\
  \ asked by Staszek, a shepherd in his late thirties, if I want a shot of vodka.\
  \ Of course I want. While grabbing the bottle that I got the day before I have a\
  \ memory of buying it at the shop that was closed. I knocked at the door of the\
  \ owner\u2019s mother\u2019s house asking to be let in to the shop. I was \u2013\
  \ so now I am able to have my morning ration of vodka.\n-Another, so we don\u2019\
  t hobble? \u2013 he asks seconds after we are done with the first.\n-Sure.\nThere\
  \ goes another one. It is just a common vodka you can find in any shop in this country.\
  \ It\u2019s warm which at that moment makes it better as it\u2019s warming you from\
  \ inside. It\u2019s special: there is a whole ritual that is happening on that snow-capped\
  \ passage. A ritual that has hundreds witnesses: Tadek (Staszek\u2019s brother),\
  \ more than 300 ewes, 3 tups and 3 dogs (the order of that enumeration is meaningful).\n\
  There is one glass only. That\u2019s how it\u2019s done there. Staszek pours the\
  \ first shot for himself, looks at me, says \u201Chealth!\u201D, drinks, shakes\
  \ down the last drop that stays in the glass, and pours one for me. I have to look\
  \ at him, say \u201Chealth!\u201D, empty my shot-glass, shake down the last drop\
  \ that stayed in the glass and \u2013 as we decided to have a second round \u2013\
  \ pour one for him.\nI know what to do. I have been to the mountains before, hung\
  \ out with locals, so I know how Polish Highlanders drink and how serious it can\
  \ be for them. I feel like I passed the test. It has been less than ten hours since\
  \ I joined them but they already know that I am dead serious about taking their\
  \ yearly migration route - seven long days of marching. That I know how to get a\
  \ bottle at that dead end village. And that I know how to drink. I know how to behave.\
  \ How to be cautiously hospitable: there is no place for overexaggerated enthusiasm.\n\
  Next week I will be roaming with them, taking part in their ancient, nomadic tradition.\
  \ I will be talking with them, sharing food and drinks, and taking care of their\
  \ animals. Even though it is only the first day and I have no detailed knowledge\
  \ of how they work I already know I will be let closer in than I could ever wish\
  \ for. A glorious feeling for anyone willing to experience something that is out\
  \ of reach for most."
