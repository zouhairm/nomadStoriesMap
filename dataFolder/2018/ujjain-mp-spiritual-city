Text: "I was in Ujjain (MP) for the in January 14 and 15. In Ujjain, there is a lot\
  \ of temples. It is believed that Lord Shiva is the king of Ujjain. People in Ujjain\
  \ beliefs that they are the luckiest . Everybody in Ujjain wishes each other by\
  \ saying \"Jai Mahakal\". 'Mahakal' means \"Lord Shiva\". In Ujjain, we can't find\
  \ any alcohol shop or meat shop. Restaurants owner always put a holding, pure vegetarian\
  \ written on it. In every street in Ujjain, one can find many temples. One can say\
  \ almost every home in Ujjain is a temple. Ujjain city also related to \"lord Krishna\"\
  . Shri Krishna studied here. Sandipani was his master (guru in hindi). You can find\
  \ lots of Shiva lingas in Ujjain. In Ujjain a temple name \"Mata harsiddhi Devi\
  \ Mandir\" is very special. In every evening people do aarti with around 1100 diyas.\
  \ The cost of this Aarti is around 9000 rupees and every evening this expenditure\
  \ is given by another person. In Ujjain we can find many \"Gau Shalas\". You will\
  \ see in Ujjain that many young boys from age group 10 to 15 year old, speaking\
  \ \"sanskrit\". A 20 year old boy in Ujjain offer Pandit family becomes a full time\
  \ pandit (pandit means who do pooja for people). My special pooja is also done by\
  \ a 20 year old Pandit . I was surprised to see him that how good he was in Sanskrit.\
  \ I was very impressed with him.\nIt is good to say this kind of people in Ujjain\
  \ because in big cities like Delhi people are going away from our values. Young\
  \ boys have no knowledge about Hindu But in Ujjain things are different. In Ujjain,\
  \ nobody is unemployed. In Mahakal's city, every local man is earning good money.\
  \ I found Ujjain city a very peaceful city. muslim population in Ujjain also related\
  \ with hotels and restaurants. They also put lord Shiva photo in their Holdings.\
  \ \nMain temple in Ujjain is Jai Mahakal's Temple. Very high security is there.\
  \ Peoples are not allowed to go with their mobile phones in Mahakal's Temple. But\
  \ it's ok. Because this is for the safety for them. In Monday (it is believes that\
  \ Monday is day for lord Shiva. Monday is belongs to lord Shiva) crowd is much more\
  \ than the other days. Peoples are not allowed to go to the main Mahakal's Shiv\
  \ Linga . If one want to go near he has to extra fees. By doing this they controls\
  \ large number crowd very well.\nBharat Mata Mandir also in Ujjain.It's a very beautiful\
  \ temple. \nIn last, I want to say that I love Ujjain. I want to come here more\
  \ times. This was my first time and many more to come. A very spiritual city.Jai\
  \ Mahakal\U0001F64F"
