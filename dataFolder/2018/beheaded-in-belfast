Text: "Two years ago, I was nearly beheaded in Belfast.\nOver the last decade, Northern\
  \ Ireland has been establishing a reputation for itself with its world-class screen\
  \ industry. The most publicised production to have taken place there is the filming\
  \ of HBO\u2019s Game of Thrones. I travelled to Belfast to explore.\nOutside the\
  \ Belfast International Youth Hostel, I greeted my tour guide, Michael, and off\
  \ we went to Castle Ward Estate in County Down. As we left the hostel in our wake,\
  \ Michael wasted no time in putting out a disclaimer to his tour group. \u201CTo\
  \ be frank with you lot, I\u2019m not a Game of Thrones fan so please don\u2019\
  t ask me who my favorite character is because I don\u2019t watch it.\u201D As one,\
  \ we nodded understandingly \u2013 a person had to put food on the table. An explosion\
  \ of sound erupted from the front of the coach as Michael howled in laughter at\
  \ our reaction to his fib, giving us a crash course in Northern Irish humor.\nThe\
  \ main building of Castle Ward is an atypical castle. Rebuilt in the 18th century\
  \ by a lord and lady with different tastes, it is Palladian in the front and Gothic\
  \ in the back, a veritable architectural mullet. The unusual mansion aside, the\
  \ estate also boasts the ruins of Audley\u2019s Castle, Strangford Lough (pronounced\
  \ lock) or lake, which is home to the Common and Grey Seal and serves as the wintering\
  \ grounds for migrating birds, and a farmyard. These attractions are accessible\
  \ from the four-kilometer Castle Ward Farm Trail.\nUpon our arrival at the estate\u2019\
  s farmyard, we were greeted by another guide in a costume reminiscent of the Starks\u2019\
  . Castle Ward\u2019s farmyard and historic tower house are familiar to those who\
  \ watch the popular HBO series as it is the filming location for Winterfell. Before\
  \ the newer mansion was built, this three-storey tower house was the original homestead\
  \ of the Ward family. In the stables of the farmyard, we were shown the CGI creation\
  \ of Winterfell before being invited outside to try our hand at archery, with one\
  \ stipulation \u2013 the worst archer would be executed by the best.\nAt the end\
  \ of the rounds, our costumed guide declared our scores (I was second last) and\
  \ pointed the boy with the lowest score to the tree stump. The boy knelt as the\
  \ winner took up a foam battle axe with much enthusiasm and pretended to behead\
  \ him in front of the tour group. Safely camouflaged in the crowd, I laughed in\
  \ relief with everyone else. After all, I had narrowly avoided joining the White\
  \ Walkers."
