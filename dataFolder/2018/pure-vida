Text: "\u2018Pura Vida\u2019 is literally translated as pure or simple life in English.\
  \ Aside from hearing it used as a greeting and a farewell by the Tico\u2019s it\
  \ had no significance to me as a travelling Brit. That was until I met Rafael.\n\
  \nAfter our first encounter in the isolated Costa Rican village of Parismina, I\
  \ was eager to return for an opportunity to learn more about this enchanting character.\
  \ From the sugar cane and lemons he gifted me from his land, I had made some fresh\
  \ lemonade to surprise him with. I approached his home on a lightly trodden path\
  \ while the backing track of the jungle played in my ears. His land was a painter\u2019\
  s canvas limited to only using shades of green and framed on all four sides by dense\
  \ vegetation. \n\nWith no door to knock on, I called out his name to announce my\
  \ arrival. The silhouette of Rafael emerged from the dark kitchen and greeted me\
  \ with a warm embrace. Like the first time we met, he was bare-footed, bare-chested\
  \ and with a grin wrinkling up his bearded face. Despite his sun-aged skin he had\
  \ a youthful twinkle in his eye, which made me question if he really was as old\
  \ as I had heard. \n\nI followed him into his smoky kitchen where a pot of water\
  \ was heating over an open wood fire. His home was modest, made entirely from wood,\
  \ which he had made with nothing more than care, pride and his two experienced hands.\
  \ There were two basic rooms, a damp mud floor and no power or running water. He\
  \ spent all of his days here and to most it would seem like he was poor. Though\
  \ I began to see that he had only what he needed and could want for nothing more.\n\
  \nEach with a cup of fresh lemonade, we moved outside to where Rafael filled the\
  \ void in his worn chair. We chatted (in Spanglish) about how he lives self sustainably,\
  \ growing almost all he needs from the land. Without a word, he stood up and began\
  \ proudly leading me along the rows of vegetables, fruit trees and \u2018herbal\
  \ remedies\u2019 that he was methodically growing. Intrigued by the man and inspired\
  \ by his ways, I asked for a photo to capture the moment. He disappeared inside\
  \ to return seconds later tying a red bandana around his head to complete the look.\n\
  \nAt this point I finally understood the beauty in his simple way of life. His world\
  \ is uncomplicated, not centred around \u2018things\u2019 or having more. Rafael\
  \ lives entirely for today as he believes that in reality he could be gone tomorrow.\
  \ This makes him a free man, not constrained by fear or hindered by stress each\
  \ day. He lives a pura vida."
