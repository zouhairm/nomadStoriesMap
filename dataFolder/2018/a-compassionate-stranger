Text: "Giddy chatter permeated the pub. I paid my bill, leaving my half-eaten fish\
  \ and chips and barely-drank Guinness with the bartender. Cheerful goodbyes followed\
  \ me as I stepped out into the cool weather, breathing deep to taste the salty air\
  \ of Belfast. I was Gretel, twisting her way along the dirt path, surrounded by\
  \ dense trees, venturing farther into the heart of the forest. The storefronts were\
  \ my trees, the cobblestones my path. Tucking my bag close to me, I ushered along\
  \ to the queue for the highly-recommended black taxi tours.\n\nWe drove through\
  \ the gated neighborhoods. Brightly-colored murals contrasted the silence as solemn\
  \ reminders of the victims, of the challenges the Irish community struggled with\
  \ for decades. I stood before the Peace Wall, straining my neck to see the top.\
  \ I signed my name and hoped that Northern Ireland would see a peaceful future.\
  \ \n\nBack in the cab, sun splintered off the Titanic Museum as we sped by on my\
  \ return to the city centre. The impenetrable accent of my tour guide and driver\
  \ disappeared into the background as I tuned into my thoughts and surroundings.\
  \ We came to a gradual stop, signaling the end of our time together. Our eyes met\
  \ in the rearview mirror. He smiled. I returned the smile and thanked him on my\
  \ exit.\n\nI meandered down the street admiring the architecture, losing myself\
  \ once more in Belfast\u2019s beauty. The early afternoon sun faded and gentle rainclouds\
  \ settled in. I lifted my hood, lowered my head and quickened my pace to escape\
  \ the drizzle. What time was it? I glanced down at my watch; it\u2019s 15:00. Tick.\
  \ I halted to a stop. Looking up, everything looked foreign. Tock. Where am I? Tick.\
  \ My cheeks burned. Tock. Panic settled into my chest and pain strengthened in my\
  \ stomach. Tick. How do I get back to the depot? Tock. I\u2019m going to miss my\
  \ bus.\n\nI stumbled into the nearest store, hoping to find a map. In my peripheral,\
  \ I saw an older woman watching at me. She calmly walked over, stood close and whispered,\
  \ \u201CThis is your first time in Ireland.\u201D It wasn\u2019t a question. \n\n\
  I nodded. \u201CHow do you like it?\u201D Her voice was soft, her eyes gentle. \u201C\
  It\u2019s\u2026beautiful\u2026everyone has been so kind and generous.\u201D As we\
  \ spoke the panic subsided. She gave me detailed directions, reassuring me I was\
  \ only a few minutes\u2019 walk from my destination.\n\nOutside, I glanced through\
  \ window hoping to see her one more time. She was gone. I smiled, thankful for the\
  \ mysterious woman that helped me find my way."
