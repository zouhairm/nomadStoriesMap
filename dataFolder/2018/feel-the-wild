Text: It was the last day in New Zealand. Three weeks of adventures in our small,old,
  automatic van. The rain came the day we had to swim with the seals, and the raugh
  sea conditions stopped our trip. After days of kayaking in the fiords, downhill
  on muddy hills, canyoning and canoeing, we could not end our adventure this way.
  We were already travelling to Christchurch to get the plane the next day when we
  said hey, what about wild dolphins? They swim far from the rocks and maybe..yes!
  The boat was still going despite the wild sea as dolphins swim away from the rocks
  and it was less dangerous. We avoid zoos and water parks the same way we avoid 5-star
  hotels, and the tour was highly focused on the animals protection. Nobody can tell
  before if we were going to be lucky enough to see them, but it's worth trying. The
  most beautiful connection I have ever had, with free wild dolphins that nobody is
  allowed to touch. I still shake when I think about it after a whole year. The boat
  left at 5am, and when the sun was coming out, 10, 50, 100 dolphins appeared around
  us so, jump! They said. Don't tell us twice. We found ourselves dancing with those
  splendid creatures, hoping for that moment to last just a little bit longer. And
  there we were, receiving the warmest welcome in their habitat, in the cold waters
  of New Zealand.
