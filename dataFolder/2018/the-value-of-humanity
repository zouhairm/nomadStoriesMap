Text: "We were told to choose a vehicle. We climbed into the back of a truck and sweat\
  \ immediately dripped down my face, my back. The truck takes off and ten minutes\
  \ later, stops and a blind fold is put over my eyes. With my sight taken, my other\
  \ senses kick into full gear. I hear the rumble of the truck beneath me and the\
  \ rumble of gravel as we turn off the pavement. I feel nothing but the cold metal\
  \ seat I am sitting on and the sweaty bodies of the people on either side of me.\
  \ As we are all jumbling about, my nose picks up a scent. It's not pleasant. It\
  \ smells sour, rotten. Then the swarm comes - flies everywhere. They stick to my\
  \ arms, my legs, my face. Finally, I feel the truck come to a complete stop. A hand\
  \ reaches for mine and helps me down. My feet touch the ground and something crunches\
  \ beneath them. Every step a new crunch. Here, the air is smoky. The heat of the\
  \ Laotian summer sun scorches my body as my senses fight to figure out where I am.\
  \ After several minutes of walking, I am stopped short. The group comes to a halt\
  \ and we hear the count: \"1, 2, 3 remove your blindfolds.\"\n\_\nAs my eyes work\
  \ to adjust to the blinding light, trash comes into my vision. We're at the dump.\_\
  \n\_\nWe start walking through the dump and come to the fork in the road. I look\
  \ to my right and see them. Men, women and children who live right here in the midst\
  \ of trash. My legs start moving toward them before my mind can even catch up. There\
  \ is something here I need to see, to learn. And then, I see her. Frozen, unable\
  \ to move from the spot that my feet have carried me to, I watch her. Even in this\
  \ blistering heat, her body is covered from head to toe. She is digging through\
  \ a small mountain of trash where four cows are grazing and a million flies are\
  \ swarming. I watch as she picks through the waste to find something of value. \u201C\
  What could possibly be of value here?\u201D, I wonder. Minute after minute roll\
  \ by and as tears fall from my eyes, I realize that she is. This woman is what is\
  \ of value here."
