Text: "When the local owner of the Bivou Guest House outside of Lijiang spoke of Tiger\
  \ Leaping Gorge, she laughed with a distinct fear in her eyes. There was the Australian\
  \ tourist who never came back, the Japanese man who was never seen again, the American\
  \ who fell over the edge. But you\u2019ll be fine. She told me, still laughing.\
  \ Just don\u2019t buy any pot from the old ladies along the way. \n\nI had come\
  \ to the remote and mountainous province of Yunnan, China with the intention of\
  \ making the trek through the legendary Tiger Leaping Gorge\u2014one of the deepest\
  \ canyons in the world. Far off the mega country\u2019s beaten path, a trek through\
  \ the gorge is a journey into the China\u2019s most ethnically diverse regions,\
  \ where signs spray-painted on rocks point the way to Tibet and prayer flags hang\
  \ from most village dwellings. I had long anticipated this part of my travel, yet\
  \ faced with the actual start of the journey, my fears were surmounting. Lunar New\
  \ Year in full swing and deep winter frost set in over the country, staying in Lijiang\
  \ would be far more comfortable. Hiking the gorge in any season had its risks and\
  \ even winter\u2014the safest season for the trek\u2014could bring a hailstorm and\
  \ a perilous waterfall crossings. My own self- doubt was growing louder by the moment.\
  \ But Tiger Leaping Gorge. I just had to say the name out loud. To feel the sound\
  \ of it on my tongue. \n\nI pushed myself to the beginning of the trail\u2014to\
  \ the beginning of the foothills of the Himalayas, fear very much in tact. A trail\
  \ of narrow and steep path (including the infamous and much feared \u201C28 bends\u201D\
  ), wide valleys, and yes, more than one marijuana saleswoman. Guided by the intoxicating\
  \ landscape of the jagged peaks that lead you deeper into the mist and clouds and\
  \ further from civilization, Tiger Leaping Gorge is at once a profoundly spiritual\
  \ journey and one firmly rooted in the real world, where watching your step can\
  \ be a matter of life or death. I was glad for the decision that put me on the trail\
  \ and careful of each decisive step I made going forward. Sometimes there is only\
  \ one way to go: up."
