Text: "Salt water breeze filled the air that chilly March morning just before sunrise\
  \ on the Southwest coast of Maui. I met with the locals of the Kihei Canoe Club\
  \ and, for a $40 donation, was about to have an experience of a lifetime. The sun\
  \ peaked its pink head just above the dormant volcano off in the distance. It was\
  \ time. My anxiety grew strong as I have a love-fear relationship with water. I\
  \ am drawn to it, but know its power can overcome me as it has in the past. \n\n\
  The natives gathered round to form a ceremonial circle. They began to chant in Hawaiian\
  \ as the group repeated what we heard. \u201CMahalo,\u201D which means thank you,\
  \ was a new word I had recently learned. However, I felt much like a toddler both\
  \ trying to understand the language and repeat those other words in song for the\
  \ first time. Although I didn\u2019t understand all of the words being sung, I felt\
  \ respect for these people and my surroundings. The spiritual leader of the group\
  \ asked Mother Nature to safely watch over us, and in turn promised we would respect\
  \ the sky and the birds, the creatures of the earth, and the ocean and all its inhabitants.\
  \ The elder native then blew into a conch symbolically sealing our promise to her.\
  \ \n\nPreparing for the journey, I was instructed on how to enter the water with\
  \ the outrigger canoe. We lined up on the left side of the canoe facing the water.\
  \ I was second in line, and was clumsy and nervous. What if I screwed this up? Then,\
  \ there was a countdown\u2026 3, 2, 1. We ran into the tide grasping the canoe,\
  \ and one by one, had to jump in, butt-first, and immediately begin rowing in synchronized\
  \ fashion. Thump! I felt my thigh hit the side of the boat before landing in my\
  \ seat and rowing without missing a beat. The pain was immense, but excitement overcame\
  \ me, \u201CI did it,\u201D and the pain I felt ceased to exist anymore. \n\nWe\
  \ rowed hard against the powerful waves. Just as I felt that my arms could not give\
  \ anymore, we stopped to rest and the water was calm. I looked around, and took\
  \ in Maui and all its beauty. As I sat there hoping to catch a glimpse of some wildlife,\
  \ a humpback whale approached about 20 feet from our canoe and began to put on a\
  \ show for us. As I looked her in the eye, I felt a connection, like she spoke to\
  \ me, \u201CDon\u2019t be afraid to face your fears, for what is life if you are\
  \ not living?\u201D Shortly after, she swam beneath our canoe, and went off to explore\
  \ the depths of the sea. It was then that I discovered my purpose for being there\
  \ and the true meaning of Mahalo."
