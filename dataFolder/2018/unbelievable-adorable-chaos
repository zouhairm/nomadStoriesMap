Text: "Chaos. Scooters. Negative chaos. People shouting. Positive chaos. Unbelievable\
  \ adorable chaos. Welcome to \u201Cla bella Napoli\", the Southern Italian city\
  \ of contradictions. As you might know, when it comes to Naples you cry two times:\
  \ once when you arrive and once when you leave. \n\nI cried first when I arrived\
  \ as a student full of hopes in a city that seemed to be nothing more than a dangerous,\
  \ dirty and unpredictable corner of Italy. Then I cried second when I had to drag\
  \ my 32 kilos suitcase on the ancient little streets paved with volcanic rocks until\
  \ we finally reached our destination: the ancient typical house on Vico Maiorani\
  \ in the historical center of the city\u2026 Later I finally started smiling when\
  \ the reasearch of a supermarket brought us in front of the sea and of the magnificent\
  \ Vesuvius, the silent giant that rules the entire area. It was then when I fell\
  \ in love and my heart started shouting in the middle of chaos: \u201Cthis is your\
  \ second home!\u201D.\n\nDay after day, for 5 months we discovered the real Napul\xE8\
  , as Neapolitans call it, the \u201Cthousand colors\" of this beautiful city, which\
  \ go way beyond the prejudices. We discovered why is Naples the \u201Ccity of the\
  \ sun\", why there is no pizza as the one in Napul\xE8, where \u201Ctiramis\xF9\"\
  \ got its name and why you have to eat at least one \u201Cgelato\u201D a day in\
  \ order to live a happy life. And remember: if you want to get to know the real\
  \ Napoli, you have to meet the real Neapolitans, you have to hear them singing or\
  \ whistling and see them dancing traditional Italian dances on the streets. You\
  \ have to observe the passion they put in everything they do in order to understand\
  \ that movies tell the truth: Italians are the way they are being depicted, even\
  \ though not even they realize it. Least but not last, don't you dare leaving without\
  \ taking a day trip to Capri, Ischia or Procida and the Amalfi Coast: you will have\
  \ the chance to experience an earthly paradise for a day.\n\nThis is how you will\
  \ finally understand why you have to love this city. I did: after 5 months I was\
  \ the only one not crying in the airplane: something told me I would be back soon.\
  \ And I was: after a year or so I went back and then the Italian charm didn't let\
  \ me go away anymore. It took me by the hands and hugged me and showed me what real\
  \ Italian romance is. So here I am: telling my love story to the entire world from\
  \ the city where I cried several times, but not once when I left: because I am here\
  \ to stay."
