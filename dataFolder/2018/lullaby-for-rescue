Text: "-The last bus was at 6:30; - said the man as he continued walking past our\
  \ shocked and speechless faces, with no turning back.\n3 minutes of silence. Trying\
  \ to understand what was going on. I was in the middle of nowhere with a guy I had\
  \ met earlier that day. He looked weird, I could tell that. A minute of looking\
  \ around, trying to come up with an idea of self-rescue. \u201CWhat am I supposed\
  \ to do?\u201D revolving in my head. We are literally in a desert, nothing around\
  \ reminds of humanity or life. \n-Guess, we gotta sleep right here, thanks god it\u2019\
  s warm;- he was slowly locating his body on the bare ground.\nWhat? Seriously? Was\
  \ that actually happening to me? The one thing I knew for sure was that I didn\u2019\
  t trust him. And I verbally had no plans of staying outside at night with the strange\
  \ person from Mozambique. \n\u201CThere are still some places, where people eat\
  \ people, for example in some African countries\u201D, - I\u2019m trying to shut\
  \ my geography teacher\u2019s voice up in my head. \n\u201CDon\u2019t trust people\
  \ easily, Gaya, get to know them more, before deciding whether you can share a part\
  \ of your life with them or not. Especially when it comes to travelling. Only go\
  \ with the ones you know for 100%, to make sure you\u2019re safe.\u201D ;- Mom,\
  \ please, stop!!! Stop talking to me, you\u2019re not here, stop existing in my\
  \ head!!! \nI have to think straight. I have to do something. I have to get away\
  \ from the man. I can\u2019t stay the whole night here. I don\u2019t even know what\
  \ animals might come along in this place. Something certainly has to be done! \n\
  -Are you gonna stand right there all night? ; - it\u2019s him talking to me. \n\
  -Mmmmmm, no, I\u2019m going. Stay safe. \nGosh! Where am I going? Where can I go\
  \ at this hour? \n-Okay, take care;- he says.\nI start walking away. He goes back\
  \ to sleeping. I\u2019m hungry. My feet are aching. He\u2019s mumbling something\
  \ in his sleep. \nIn a minute all the horror movies I have ever seen come in a line,\
  \ flashing before my eyes in a row. And I give up. Trying. Hoping. Searching for\
  \ the ways. I just kneel down and tears feel my throat. I\u2019m lost. \nI feel\
  \ someone on my back. Touching my shoulders. Whispering something in my ear. Words,\
  \ I don\u2019t understand. That\u2019s him. I\u2019m stunned and scared as hell.\
  \ He\u2026 is singing me a lullaby in his language.  I am no longer shaking. I close\
  \ my eyes. The next thing I heard was him, saying :\n-Good morning, miss, hurry\
  \ up, so that we catch the morning bus to the city\u2026"
