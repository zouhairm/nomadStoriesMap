Text: "After a long commute, I finally arrived in Baguio city, a town located in the\
  \ mountains of Northern Luzon in the Philippines.  After a quick meal and a drink\
  \ at a local bar, my weary body was screaming for a relaxing massage. I asked around,\
  \ and the locals directed me to this massage parlor whose masseurs were all blind.\
  \ Truth be told, I didn\u2019t know much about blind people, the full extent of\
  \ their capabilities and the lack thereof.  In fact, my only \u201Corientation\u201D\
  \ on blindness was Al Pacino's Oscar winning role as a blind retired general with\
  \ an attitude in the movie \"Scent of a Woman.\" That was it. However, this all\
  \ changed the day I met Alex, a blind masseur.\n\nI\u2019m one loquacious guy, and\
  \ about the only time I keep my mouth zip is when I\u2019m sleeping or getting a\
  \ massage.  But the very first time I got to share a space with a blind masseur,\
  \ curiosity got the best of me that I broke my cardinal rule of keeping my mouth\
  \ shut.  Yes, I asked the worst question one could possibly ask a blind person,\
  \ \u201CAlex, do blind people go to strip bars?\u201D  Common sense dictates that\
  \ they wouldn\u2019t, right? To do so would be an exercise in futility as they wouldn\u2019\
  t get any \u201Creturn on investments.\u201D  But the masseur just smiled and noted\
  \ that not all blind people are totally blind, and that people with partial blindness\
  \ can still recognize shapes that can be associated, albeit blurred, to some body\
  \ parts. Ergo, they too can still enjoy a good \u201CShow Time!\u201D  \n\nAs we\
  \ continued to talk, and I learned a few more interesting things on being blind,\
  \ like blind people often hang out with just blind people, and that it\u2019s totally\
  \ normal for one group of blind people to clash with another group of blind people.\
  \  Sometimes, they too figure in a brawl among themselves, and it\u2019s during\
  \ this time when their ears and voices become just as important as their fists.\
  \  You see, they use their ears to target, fists to punch, and voice, often by shouting\
  \ their names, to avoid getting hit by their friends.\n\nOur exchange provided me\
  \ with invaluable insights like the fact that they\u2019re blind makes them more\
  \ resilient to temptations.  Another realization was that blind people are the ideal\
  \ lovers. We\u2019ve all fallen in love, and we know that sometimes it is our very\
  \ eyes that blind from seeing what\u2019s truly important.  \n\nAs my massage session\
  \ ended, I was really grateful to Alex, for with our conversation, I got a priceless\
  \ education. Indeed, even in the valley of the sighted, the blind can take you to\
  \ school."
