Text: "Costa Rica is supposed to be lush, muddy, and biodiverse. My new home, Potrero,\
  \ is different. Here, dust comes out of the tap, and water restrictions rule. The\
  \ locals leave buckets out in hopes of rain. The rain never comes. The first warning\
  \ sign occurred 17 years ago. The University of Costa Rica found the region\u2019\
  s aquifers to be \u201Cthreatened by over-exploitation.\u201D Nothing was done.\
  \ \n\nIn 2014, the water company AyA seized control of Potrero\u2019s water facility\
  \ from ASADA, a community development organization. For reference, in 2007, AyA\
  \ had been sued for granting water use permits without actually knowing how much\
  \ water was in town aquifers. According to locals, AyA favors gringos. \n\nIndeed,\
  \ AyA quickly siphoned water from Potrero to Las Catalinas, a resort down the road.\
  \ Protests erupted. The national police stepped in. The town of Potrero sued AyA.\
  \ The court ruled in AyA\u2019s favor. The press caught on. Presidential hopefuls\
  \ spoke up. Then, the protests spread. Everybody was talking about Potrero. When\
  \ AyA sued ASADA for civil disobedience, their initial ruling was overturned. Potrero\
  \ celebrated.\n\nYet, ASADA did not live up to the people\u2019s hopes. Within months,\
  \ Las Catalinas and the surrounding tourist areas controlled over 65% of the town\u2019\
  s water. I asked my neighbor Maria why the protests stopped. \u201CPeople got tired\
  \ and the country moved on,\u201D she said in Spanish. Besides, \u201Cthe burden\
  \ always falls on us, the women.\u201D \n\nThe women are also tasked with childcare,\
  \ house cleaning, and work (if they\u2019re lucky). Potrero is Costa Rica\u2019\
  s last frontier. With only 300 residents and 2 stunning shorelines, the foreigners\
  \ are flocking to town. However, the hotels, which treat their own water and spend\
  \ millions on foliage, leave travelers unaware of the dire situation nearby. \n\n\
  Potrero's residents apply in mass to the hotels, restaurants, and stores that have\
  \ been built on their farms. Unfortunately, the jobs go to more privileged Costa\
  \ Ricans: people from cities who\u2019ve finished high school. While Costa Rica\u2019\
  s education system soars, the children of Potrero spend an average of 2 hours a\
  \ day in school and attend only 84 days per year. Most can\u2019t read Spanish,\
  \ much less speak English. \n\nAs a result, Potrero\u2019s population is growing\
  \ rapidly while its water level shrinks. The increased demand and reduced supply\
  \ is rocketing prices. The locals are desperate and crime is on the rise. Eventually,\
  \ the outsiders will feel it. Costa Rica must act now to stave of tomorrow\u2019\
  s water war."
