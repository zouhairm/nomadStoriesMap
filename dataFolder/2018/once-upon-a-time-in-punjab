  \ to ferozpur, punjab. He is an INDIAN ARMY . So packed up all our things and we\
  \ moved to Punjab. But I didn't completed my 2nd Standard because I was about to\
  \ go to Punjab. Though my friend's mom was principal at that time. She did us a\
  \ favor by giving a TC to join in Punjab. But she given with one condition that\
  \ I must join in that same school again when I come back . I accepted because that's\
  \ my favorite school . Then after all we started traveling to Punjab in train.The\
  \ journey was extremely awesome.I was sitting in the window seat and seeing the\
  \ new places and it's beautiful scenery while traveling. Two days later we reached\
  \ Punjab at Early Morning. He got a government quarters. So moved our things inside\
  \ we started to sleep. Next day I woke up and came outside it was extremely awesome\
  \ .very cold temperature and beautiful trees and new people.pleasent atmosphere\
  \ and so on. One funny thing is smoke was coming from my nose and mouth. I don't\
  \ know why it was coming\U0001F602\U0001F602  so I called my mom and asked her why\
  \ smoke is coming from my nose and mouth?.Then she said it's because of very cold\
  \ temperature. Then started playing with that smoke thing\U0001F602\U0001F602.it\
  \ was Sunday after some time I saw few guys playing in the ground. So I went downstairs\
  \ and started making new frnds. But I dont know hindhi that time so started conversing\
  \ in English only. Side by side I started learning hindhi within a month I got a\
  \ very good fluency in hindhi. And days passed with a awesome memories and joined\
