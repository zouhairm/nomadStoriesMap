Text: "I was expecting a gleeful journey of meeting out-of-box characters and swirling\
  \ in a motley of points of views. After all, I have flied all the way across the\
  \ Pacific to West coast, the best coast, in Bay Area, where everyone carries a smile,\
  \ and the gossamer plume of Frisco fog shrouds the dreamy Californian sky like a\
  \ 60\u2019s poet. \n\nBut sitting in the manager\u2019s office where the AC hummed\
  \ in full blast, I shivered and felt the sweat crystallized on the back of my spine.\
  \ \n\nThe manager managed quite successfully in extracting a speck of concern from\
  \ the hollow of her eyes as she inquired after me. Her voice was high-pitched and\
  \ tangled with the rich fragrance of No.5; her bling French nails stripped with\
  \ red and golden paints unclasp and spread like a pair of chicken wings; her black\
  \ eyes stared from the dissembling depth of the sockets beneath her Californian\
  \ tan. I told her I was fine and exchanged with her a tacit smile of mutual defense.\n\
  \nShe apologized for whacking me out of the gym and solicited my purpose in their\
  \ property. I replied that I was traveling in Bay Area and had just come down from\
  \ San Fransisco to visit a friend. I\u2019d paid for my stay at their fine establishment\
  \ on Airbnb till Friday. \n\nAirbnb? She asked. \n\nI nodded and had at the instant\
  \ a premonition of regret. \n\nShe smiled. Only this time, it was the smile of triumph\
  \ \u2014 she had trapped me to rat. \n\nI grimaced to resemble a smile in return\
  \ and stuttered the next few sentences to imply that English, being indeed my second\
  \ language, was what held the blame for her misunderstanding that Jenny, my host\
  \ on Airbnb, was actually the friend I wanted to visit. \n\nGently I reminded her\
  \ the right we are all entitled to have friends over for holidays, especially in\
  \ Cali, where all rights are respected. Politely she implored me to relax and cut\
  \ the crap by assuring me that I could stay till Friday if I played my move right.\
  \ \u201CIt\u2019s against our policy for residents to lease the property without\
  \ our knowledge,\" she explained, and in other words, her job to ensure my inconvenience\
  \ and apologize for it. \n\nThe last thing I expect, with hindsight, is to run thousands\
  \ of miles away to see what I have always expected \u2014 Man being what is expected\
  \ of being a man. \n\nI ratted on Jenny. And a while later, in the empty corridor,\
  \ I found the letter of eviction flapping in warm breeze on the door of 506."
