Text: "The terrorist had the biggest smile and the biggest gun I had ever seen. \n\
  \nHe approached me on a July afternoon. It was a hot day, the peak of the Lebanese\
  \ summer. \u201CI\u2019m so sorry, habibi,\u201D the terrorist said. He was bald\
  \ and bearlike, his eyes kind and soft. \u201CBut may I please see your passport?\
  \ Again, I\u2019m so sorry about this.\u201D \n\nMy guts constricted at the sight\
  \ of him. I hadn\u2019t expected to get pulled over. Oh God, if he saw something\
  \ he didn\u2019t like\u2013 if there was some trace of my trip to Israel \u2013\
  \ \n\nI fished out my passport, casting a longing look at the city behind him. I\
  \ crossed Lebanon to see this place. Baalbek. Baalbek with its Shi\u2019ite mosques,\
  \ their domes burning blue in the sun. Baalbek with its Roman temples to Jupiter\
  \ and Bacchus, their columns titanic. The finest historical site in Lebanon, a playground\
  \ for someone like me. \n\nBut Baalbek was also a playground for Hezbollah, the\
  \ Shi\u2019ite Party of God. Only a month ago, I visited Israel, Lebanon\u2019s\
  \ ancestral enemy. In cities like Beirut or Byblos, where the Lebanese government\
  \ was in control, getting caught with evidence of Israeli travel meant deportation.\
  \ If Hezbollah caught me, however, deportation would be the least of my worries.\
  \ Spawned from Lebanon\u2019s fifteen-year civil war, they had blown people apart\
  \ in Buenos Aires, Tel Aviv, and Beirut. Only ten years ago they rained hell and\
  \ death into the Galilee. If they caught me, they would do with me as they pleased.\
  \ \n\nThe terrorist took my passport with a gentle tilt of his head. Had he been\
  \ born anywhere else in the world, he would have become some top-class hotelier,\
  \ maybe an expensive sommelier. Perhaps he once wanted to become one, long before\
  \ the wars that shattered his country. I wondered whether he\u2019d been there when\
  \ the Israelis smashed into Beirut, back in 1982. Whether he once stood on a hill\
  \ in South Lebanon, his rocket launcher aimed at some distant kibbutz. How, against\
  \ all odds, his smile survived fifteen years of invasion and civil war. \n\nHe flipped\
  \ through the pages. My heart drummed faster and faster. One Israeli sticker, one\
  \ Hebrew character, and I was doomed. \n\nSuddenly the terrorist paused, squinting\
  \ at a page. I stared at him. I wanted to scream. \n\nThen, slowly, his face broke\
  \ into a broad grin.  \u201CNo problems! Welcome to Baalbek. I hope you didn\u2019\
  t mind the wait, habibi. I\u2019m so sorry about the trouble.\u201D"
