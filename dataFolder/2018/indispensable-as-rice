Text: "The pungent smell of roasted fish invaded me, anticipating the sound of my\
  \ alarm clock, which anyway deafened me soon. \nBorneo, Kalimantan, August 2015.\
  \ \nWhen I opened the door of my room, the guide I had taken the night before in\
  \ the common room of that ramshackle guesthouse of Muara Muntai, jumped around me\
  \ cheerful and excited. The motorized canoe was ready to sail to lead us to the\
  \ most unexplored latitudes of the Mahakam river, looking for the last true Dayaks.\
  \ \n5.15 A.M. \nThe shy sun hesitated to rise in that segment of the Equator. The\
  \ canoe cut silent and determined the water of that river that looked like a sea.\
  \ Among the fairy-tale fogs that rose from the calm water, they were playing the\
  \ golden gleams of a flaming ball that would have soon made its entrance of honor.\n\
  That morning Johnny, my guide, had not come alone. With him, there was a tiny woman\
  \ with an indecipherable age and a radiant smile. She did not speak a word of English.\
  \ They spoke for her, her eyes. With the sweetness of a mother, she offered me the\
  \ breakfast. A fistful of yellow rice with river fish in a banana leaf. The rainbow\
  \ of scents of unknown spices was only a sign of the explosion of flavors that would\
  \ have been triggered at the first bite. I realized I was hungry and that I liked\
  \ a lot eating spicy fish early in the morning. \nJohnny told me he was originally\
  \ from Lombok and had moved to Samarinda twenty years before in search of his fortune.\
  \ Instead, he found hard work and little money. Nevertheless, he had no remorse,\
  \ because he had found his real fortune her, Batari. His eyes filled with light\
  \ in telling me about the first meeting with his bride. Then they were veiled with\
  \ melancholy. Bluntly, he told me that she could not have children, that they had\
  \ tried without success all the remedies that the popular wisdom advised as infallible.\
  \ Then again the light in his eyes: he told me it did not matter, because for him\
  \ she was as indispensable as rice. On the other hand, he told me, how can you live\
  \ without rice? I smiled. He smiled. She lit up with a radiant laugh. She did not\
  \ understand English, or maybe just a little.\nYes, they were one of those rare\
  \ cases of marriage just for love, in which the awareness of infertility had not\
  \ been followed by the repudiation of the wife by the husband.\nMeanwhile the hot\
  \ sun had risen in an instant. Already high in the sky, it greeted flocks of birds\
  \ that I had never seen before. I felt blessed by the sun and inebriated by life."
