Text: "And I was really beginning to like this town\u2026 it was clean, quiet, virtually\
  \ free of tourists\u2026 the street food, including charcoal-grilled stingray, was\
  \ excellent\u2026 the neon lights over the bridge were reminiscent more of something\
  \ you'd find on Morey's Piers than here in Central Nam.\n\nIt was an endearing place\
  \ - cute, local - like a semi-larger version of Cambodia's Battambang.  And it still\
  \ is, but the deep purple blisters on the bottoms of my feet have not yet healed.\
  \  Sandburns.  And damn did I feel slower than molasses, as if I was being weighed\
  \ down by the looming gravity of losing all of the photos I had taken all Summer.\n\
  \nThe guy had a football field head start on me as I fumbled out of the crystal\
  \ clear South China Sea.  That, and he was wearing a motorbike helmet: I didn't\
  \ stand a chance.\n\nAs for the smattering of onlookers, they may have not sensed\
  \ anything out-of-the-ordinary until a 34-year old bushy American came lumbering\
  \ over the sand and across the plaza, screaming and motioning something about a\
  \ backpack being taken.\n\nMy contorted grimace may have been the most explicitly\
  \ honest expression my face has made in years; I guess I'm fortunate that this degree\
  \ of anger for me is so rare.\n\nAs mentioned - it all seemed to happen so fast.\
  \  Before I knew it, I was on the back of some kind soul's motorbike, grabbing the\
  \ rest of my belongings and sitting in the rectangular shade of a room in the police\
  \ station, with three or four olive-dressed young officers and the assumed bossman,\
  \ over 60 and smoking at the head of the table, under red signs and flags, occasionally\
  \ looking up from his newspaper but showing no opinion - good or bad - of my presence.\""
