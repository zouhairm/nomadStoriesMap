Text: "I jerk awake when the movement stops. Dawn is breaking and outside everything\
  \ is, much like us, still. Why aren\u2019t we moving? Our bus is standing at a crossroad\
  \ in the middle of Mexico\u2019s southernmost state, Chiapas, drowning in the mist\
  \ from the rainforest that is all around us. This can\u2019t be another pee break,\
  \ there is no gas station here, no OXXO \u2013 the 24 hour supermarket chain that\
  \ colonizes the entire country \u2013, no nothing. There is only this tall, dense\
  \ jungle, painted in a million subtle shades of green, coating the hills as far\
  \ as the eye can see. It\u2019s probably harbouring more life per square metre than\
  \ anywhere else in this planet and yet it has this stillness, this inscrutable,\
  \ haunting, cryptic stillness, it almost seems as though the mysteries of the ancient\
  \ Mayan civilization had been imbued into it.\nAs my mind gradually awakens, it\
  \ starts racing with catastrophic inventiveness. Is this another earthquake? The\
  \ ground keeps getting these shivers every now and then these days, but it was the\
  \ lack of movement that woke me up this time. Is this a roadblock? All the stories\
  \ I heard about the Zapatista revolutionaries chase each other in and out of my\
  \ conscience as my heartbeat fastens and my breath accelerates, and I begin to curse\
  \ myself for getting on this night bus. We are bound for the Mayan ruins of Palenque,\
  \ a destination that I was apparently so desperate to get to, that I couldn\u2019\
  t even spare the time to take this 6-hour long trip at daylight.\nWhile I am considering\
  \ this, all the other passengers are rousing, their heads turning towards me, as\
  \ I am the only one in this bus that can speak both English and Spanish. I nod,\
  \ more to myself than to them and I force my numb limbs to prop myself up and over\
  \ to the head of the bus, to find out what is going on. There is, in fact, a roadblock,\
  \ but certainly not one that I was expecting. There are women standing in front\
  \ of the bus, wearing the colourful woven dresses that I\u2019ve seen on people\
  \ from indigenous communities before. I look interrogatively at the bus driver,\
  \ who explains to me that night routes have been interfering with the survival of\
  \ these communities, based on self-sufficient agriculture and on tourists stopping\
  \ by to shop for coffee, chocolate and crafts. I think about my neatly planned schedule,\
  \ as I try to remember the words of Lao Tzu, who said that a good traveler has no\
  \ fixed plans, and is not intent on arriving, and I face my fellow travelers, hoping\
  \ to be able to convey just that."
