  \ Out, Twenty One Pilots\n\nI\u2019d spent all day dreading it. I\u2019d done a\
  \ lot already on my travels, but this was something that felt like a step too far\
  \ out of my comfort zone. I was already overwhelmed by an unfamiliar city and all\
  \ I wanted was to curl up in my hostel and read, not push myself. Despite this,\
  \ I found myself searching through alleyways at the edge of Singapore\u2019s Chinatown\
  \ for the spot I\u2019d found on google maps. There was no proper name, just a bright\
  \ neon sign:\n\nKaraoke\n\nThere were only a handful of people inside the dimly\
  \ lit venue and Mambo No. 5 was already echoing out of the speakers as I entered.\
  \ I was already feeling small and insignificant and this feeling just got worse\
  \ after I realised that the music wasn\u2019t coming from the speakers at all but\
  \ was instead the perfect performance of a Singaporean man singing from the corner.\
  \ I was dwarfed by these karaoke gods and when I sang my voice faltered and broke.\
  \ But I still felt something as I sang, a community between the people there, tourists\
  \ and locals, different cultures brought together by music and the simple act of\
  \ singing.\n\n\u201CSinging, here we go again\u2026\u201D\n-1973, James Blunt\n\n\
  That feeling of connection was what I was chasing the next time I tried, across\
  \ the world in Manchester with a group of strangers. It was still a jump out of\
  \ my comfort zone, but I was starting to realise that karaoke is the same around\
  \ the world. A way for people to connect without worrying about language, to feel\
  \ accepted no matter their culture and to just have fun. People mingled and danced\
  \ and sang, and despite being on the other side of the world, I felt at home. \n\
  \n\u201CThinking to myself, hey isn\u2019t this easy\u201D\n-You Belong With Me,\
  \ Taylor Swift\n\nMonths later I found myself at an open mic night in a small underground\
  \ bar in Budapest. Local bands performed their own songs and incredibly talented\
  \ singers came and went across the stage. I was past being shy and nervous, it had\
  \ been more than five months since that first quiet bar in Singapore and I wasn\u2019\
  t afraid. Music bridges cultures and makes friends of strangers regardless of who\
  \ they are. I stood up and sung one of the cheesiest pop songs I knew, I'm not the\
  \ best singer but it doesn't matter when everyone knows the words. I\u2019d jumped\
  \ off the edge of my fears all those months ago and it had brought me all the way\
  \ to Budapest, fearless and singing Taylor Swift with a whole room singing along\
  \ with me."
