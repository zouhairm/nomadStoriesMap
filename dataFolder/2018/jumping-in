Text: "\u201CYou can do it Annie! Don\u2019t think about it \u2013 just jump. Keep\
  \ your legs straight \u2013 now pike! PIIIIIKE\u201D. I\u2019m standing on a rickety\
  \ wooden platform about 6 metres above a small lake in Mexico, wondering if it\u2019\
  s possible to die of fright. I\u2019m dimly aware that the voice shouting encouragement\
  \ at me belongs, extraordinarily, to a stratospherically famous Hollywood \u2018\
  A List\u2019 actress. I\u2019m also about to pass out or be violently sick \u2013\
  \ neither of which feels like a good look. And I\u2019m not really sure what \u201C\
  piking\u201D is.\n \nWhat outlandish feat of bravery am I attempting? To jump off\
  \ this platform into the water.  Something a child could do. And I can\u2019t. Because\
  \ I\u2019m terrified. Of heights, of water and, until now, of life.\n\nI\u2019ve\
  \ been here in Tulum, on Mexico\u2019s Yucatan peninsula, for the past week. Imagine\
  \ a posh hippy hang-out frequented by rich yoga-toned tourists, reformed middle-class\
  \ drug dealers and drop-outs from corporate life \u2013 all of them happy, smiling\
  \ and friendly. The dusty town itself gives way to a perfect stretch of Caribbean\
  \ coast, where low-key \u201Ceco\u201D hotels recline among the palm trees, and\
  \ restaurants artfully strung with fairly lights peek out of the jungle.  Beautiful\
  \ tanned women and tastefully tattooed men waft around effortlessly dressed in perfect\
  \ boho wear.\n\nI do not fit in. I\u2019m a pale, cynical thirty-something from\
  \ West London trying to untangle a net of depression.. On my first morning a man\
  \ who looked like Jesus played a small harp over me at the end of a yoga lesson.\
  \ I\u2019m not ready for this.\n\nThen something happened \u2013 I started to say\
  \ yes to things. Yes to the local salsa night and dancing with Javier who, despite\
  \ claiming to be a cab driver, I\u2019m reasonably sure is a Mexican gangster. Yes\
  \ to visiting the ancient Mayan ruins and riding a bike for the first time in 20\
  \ years. I talked to the beautiful people and found they were as flawed as me. The\
  \ Adonis personal trainer who survived child abuse and set up his own business.\
  \ A traveller who told me about her cancer as we lay on sherbet-fine sand looking\
  \ up at the brightest stars I\u2019ve ever seen. I understood that the people, their\
  \ scars, stories and openness are far more beautiful than the superficial perfection\
  \ of this place. \n\nOn a kayaking trip, said visiting actress asks me if I\u2019\
  m going to climb up the platform and jump, I say yes. I look down and see strangers\
  \ smiling at me, shouting my name, telling me I can do this. \n\nI jump because\
  \ I finally know I will be ok. And I didn\u2019t expect that."
