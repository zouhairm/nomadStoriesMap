Text: "Once upon a time, suicide was not discussed in Uganda. \n\nIn 2009, at the\
  \ end of a nameless lane, our faceless heroine sets up shop in a dilapidated (but\
  \ functioning) psychiatric hospital and starts to change this. She alone is Uganda\u2019\
  s first suicide helpline. \n\nAt 12pm everyday she sits in the hospital garden,\
  \ next to the Secure Housing Unit (SHU). Tiny windows allow thick breeze to freshen\
  \ the sticky minds of those living life within four very small walls. It\u2019s\
  \ a wonder the linen stays crisp white, as rust-coloured dust lingers everywhere.\
  \ \n\nA chilling scream interrupts her lunchtime reverie one day in 2012, as a man\
  \ is wheeled in bleeding and disoriented. His hands are cuffed behind his back,\
  \ forcing him to sit at an awkward angle that extends his neck forward and up as\
  \ he pleads with the uniformed man in charge \u201Cplease don\u2019t lock me up,\
  \ please, I have a family, I have children, I need to go home, I\u2026\u201D but\
  \ the disgust in the standing man\u2019s face curbs the conversation before he replies\
  \ \u201Cyou should have thought about that before you tried to kill yourself, coward\u201D\
  \ and he spits on the floor as if to say \u201Cfull stop\u201D.\n\nOur heroine and\
  \ the survivor sit together the next day. \u201CWhat you have for lunch?\u201D he\
  \ asks, \u201Cmmm, rolex\u201D she replies as she takes a bite of rolled eggs wrapped\
  \ in chapati from a purple plastic bag \u201Cyou?\u201D \u2026 \u201Cugali and beans\u201D\
  \ he sighs and pokes his savoury porridge with disinterest. \u201CTrade?\u201D he\
  \ asks playfully, and she laughs. \u201CNo, no, no I am not one for the ugali BUT\
  \ I have some girl from Australia coming today, to help me with the website and\
  \ you know what these backpackers are like, I\u2019m sure she will trade her food\
  \ with you\u201D. \n\nShe was right. And an unlikely friendship formed.\n\nThe survivor,\
  \ the backpacker and our heroine sit together in the office chatting over a packet\
  \ of crisps. For the backpacker, this slice of familiarity amongst the heat, the\
  \ wails of distress from nearby rooms and the burning smell of cheap antiseptic\
  \ is a haven. The women debate suicide prevention ideologies that are literally\
  \ a world apart, while the survivor listens, transfixed.\n\nEventually he asks \u201C\
  why do you do it\u2026sit in such darkness, to help someone you not even know?\u201D\
  \n\n\u201C\u2026because everybody belongs to someone. Every child of Uganda is also\
  \ the child of a mother and father. And if they don\u2019t know how to keep on living,\
  \ that don\u2019t mean they have to die\u201D.\n\n\u201CSo you give them a happy\
  \ ever after?\u201D\n\n\u201CNo\u201D she says emphatically \u201CI give them hope,\
  \ and they build their own happily ever after\u201D."
