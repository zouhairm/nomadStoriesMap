Text: "The road is new, not finished yet. The dust dribbling down the canyon side\
  \ in the rain. The 10 Peruvian residents walk the same four hours home off the bus\
  \ with their groceries. For us, it\u2019s an exploration to discover condors and\
  \ exotic cactus fruit. Feeling entitled from our desert trek we\u2019re walking\
  \ still further down into the Colca Canyon valley to the hot spring. \nAlong the\
  \ left wall of the spring  the river lashes at us, the texture and colour of  icy\
  \ chocolate milk. I feel a small hesitation to sit too close to the edge, 10 seconds\
  \ in that and I\u2019d be dead.\n\nSitting in the spring next to the chilling  breath\
  \ of the river, gives me that feeling of lying under a feather doona, whilst the\
  \ surrounding air is cold. A feeling of luxury in an otherwise hostile world. This\
  \ place is hostile alright, cactus, stone, a few tin shacks and those vulture-like\
  \ condors looking ready to have a nibble of scrappy looking travellers.\n\nThe rain\
  \ starts to hurt, it splashes off the top of the spring into our nostrils which\
  \ are sitting just above water level. I grab my partner\u2019s  hand under the water\
  \ as we watch the world change around us. New colours appear and disappear in each\
  \ instance. \n\nThis is exactly what I wanted, that feeling of anonymity, of forgetting\
  \ that somewhere across the ocean I have a life that I have created. Here; I have\
  \ nothing. Just rain and dirt. The valley is so deep I feel like I\u2019m sitting\
  \ in the centre of the earth, nobody can find us here. I feel myself sink deeper\
  \ as the world turns to goop and mud.\n\nI stare up at the crags encasing us in\
  \ the river valley and bang, lightning hits the dirt, a dust cloud sings into the\
  \ air. Bang, another one, closer. Too close, we start to become wary. We can see\
  \ the exact point where each bolt lands, earth pushed skywards. We force ourselves\
  \ to sit longer.\n\nAbove us now, we can see a hairy, overweight, bloke walking\
  \ down in only his boardies. Bugger, definitely an Aussie. He plops himself tactlessly\
  \ into the pool, his chest hair floating ungraciously on the surface. \u201CHey,\
  \ hey where ya from?\u201D \nI sigh \u201CWollongong\u201D, realising the naivety\
  \ of any fantasies about seclusion or escaping my life.\n\nEnergetically, his arms\
  \ rocket into the air to expose his cavernous armpits \u201Cthe GOOONNNG\u201D,\
  \ he roars the colloquial nickname for my city like a rugby fan.\n\n In one of the\
  \ deepest canyons of the world, with the iced tops of the Andes rising above, you\
  \ can still hear the roar of, \"the Gong\" echoing, through the centre of the earth."
