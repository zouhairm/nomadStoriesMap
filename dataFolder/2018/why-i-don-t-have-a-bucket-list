Text: "The Bucket List. And no, I'm not talking about the cinematic adventure with\
  \ Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman.\n\nThat ever present, always looming list of\
  \ life, love, and the pursuit of happiness. Seemingly everyone has one and is quicker\
  \ to talk about it than someone who does CrossFit. Constantly adding to the sprawling\
  \ list and rarely crossing items off. It's created a culture of errant dreamers,\
  \ not doers. Skydiving. Hike Mount Kilimanjaro. See the Northern Lights. Find true\
  \ love. These experiences are not items to be condemned to something I would also\
  \ write Milk, Eggs, and Bread on: A LIST. So that's why I don't have one. \n\nRewind.\
  \ The year is 2011 and I'm at Thanksgiving. It's also the exact day that I decided\
  \ I was never again going to curate a bucket list. The previous semester I had applied\
  \ and was accepted into Lorenzo de Medici in Florence for a Semester abroad. I had\
  \ my flights, my visa, and a lovely host family. I was also diagnosed with Crohn's\
  \ that very same semester.\n\nUnable to control flares for the past 10 months leading\
  \ to Thanksgiving and cycling through medications to no avail I had a decision to\
  \ make. I was standing at the edge of the plane. I could jump and go on the trip\
  \ of a lifetime, or I could cancel my trip and crawl back in the plane.\n\nUnfortunately\
  \ this was not a happy ending, in part because it wasn't the ending. I cancelled\
  \ the trip and chose my physical health over my spiritual health. I was devastated,\
  \ watching all my friends go off on the trip of a lifetime while I watched through\
  \ the window of social media.\n\nMost people didn't know anything was wrong, they\
  \ nickname it the invisible illness for a reason. To this day I'm still not sure\
  \ if I made the right decision. Maybe I was too cautious. But I knew one thing:\
  \ I would never let it happen again. I would never let a shitty disease (Ha! Get\
  \ it?) block my way to any experience again. From that day forward, any time I had\
  \ something I wanted to cross off my list before I kicked the bucket, I would start\
  \ planning right away and cross it off as soon as possible. You never know what\
  \ is going to crop up to steal away those life moments.\n\n7 years later and I've\
  \ traveled to 11 countries while actively flaring. I've zip-lined across a rain\
  \ forest. I've seen the northern lights. And am training for my class A skydiving\
  \ license already on solo jump #9. \n\nNow when I'm pushed to the edge on a life\
  \ decision I don't think, I jump. And I'd like to see anything stop me."
