Text: "At an altitude of 14,000 ft. our lungs were giving up on our bodies. A rented\
  \ car from Kaza dropped us at Langza where we were to stay for a night & trek to\
  \ Hikkim the next day. Langza, a remote village, nestled between snow-capped mountains\
  \ had 33 small houses build on a hill beneath a 1000 year old Buddha statue. The\
  \ eerie silence in the village except for a few working women in the field suggested\
  \ that the village was pretty much empty.\nWe ascended the hill to reach a home-stay\
  \ whose billboard read \u201CSonam Homestay\u201D. It was run by the Hopal family.\
  \ Yishe Hopal, the head of the family, lived here with his wife, son, daughter in\
  \ law & grandchildren.\nBy noon, our host, Linzam, who happened to be the daughter\
  \ in law of the Hopal family took us to their dining/common room, meant for hosting\
  \ their guests. We were starving for good food & Linzam came to us like an angel.\
  \ She cooked us some rice & veggies for our lunch which was perhaps the best meal\
  \ we had ever had. The sight of homely love at 14,000 ft. from a stranger had made\
  \ that meal even more special.\nThe lack of cellular network had made it difficult\
  \ for us to contact our families. Eventually we missed them but Hopals made us feel\
  \ like home. Linzam told us about her life & that she wanted to do a job, but due\
  \ financial problems she couldn\u2019t study & instead married her school life boyfriend\
  \ to eventually get settled. Apparently her in-law, Yishe Hopal had decided to get\
  \ along with a home-stay because he felt happy helping out travellers and getting\
  \ to know their different cultural backgrounds.\nNext morning we had to hike to\
  \ Hikkim. We packed our bags while scrambled eggs and bread were waiting for us\
  \ at the dining hall. \nWell, that was it, time to bid adieu to the Hopals. We had\
  \ a photo with them on their porch with their house & the snow-capped mountains\
  \ as backdrop. The kids got us some fossils as souvenirs. They were reluctant to\
  \ take any money and replied with a smile \u201CAtithi Devo Bhava\u201D which translates\
  \ into Guest is like God.\nThe hospitality and love Hopal family, back in Sonam\
  \ Homestay ushered on us during our stay, was immense. They attended to all our\
  \ needs with great care and gave us a box-full of wonderful memories. It\u2019s\
  \ incredible to think how some random strangers make us a part of their family and\
  \ in just one night, you make such a strong connection with them only because of\
  \ their great hospitality and care for travellers. Indeed Spiti Valley gave us our\
  \ best local connection."
