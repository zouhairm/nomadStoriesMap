Text: "It\u2019s midday, and the humidity is high in Taman Negara. October is a humid\
  \ month for the Malaysian rainforest, and I am grateful for my camel pack as I walk\
  \ through the lush greenery. I pause behind our guide, DJ, and listen in vain for\
  \ the sound of wildlife. DJ shakes his head kindly, the animals know better than\
  \ to come near the walkway, where locals and travellers wander alike. We have already\
  \ trekked to the highest point of our chosen path, and stood and surveyed the 4,343\
  \ km2 expanse of trees. It is breath taking scenery, and DJ is well versed in interesting\
  \ facts about the area, showing us bark from which incense is made, telling us stories\
  \ of his life here. My partner, Daniel, and I listen, fascinated, grateful for this\
  \ private tour. \n It is all heading in one direction, and that is one that I have\
  \ been afraid of since before we arrived. The canopy walk. I am terrified of heights.\n\
  \ DJ takes us to the bottom of the canopy, and tells us he will meet us at the end,\
  \ where we will go and have lunch. I take a deep breath. As DJ walks off into the\
  \ forest, he turns and laughs, \u2018No crying!\u2019\n We climb to the start. It\u2019\
  s the lowest of all of the bridges, and I take the first step onto it. I couldn\u2019\
  t wait for Daniel to go before me, I knew that if someone wasn\u2019t behind me\
  \ I may never go. One step in front of the other, slowly, carefully, I shuffle along\
  \ the single wooden board. I try to keep my gaze steady, facing ahead. And then,\
  \ the bridge begins to swing. I turn, a child stands at the other end, laughing\
  \ and pushing it to and fro. It\u2019s too much for me and I quicken my step, desperate\
  \ to reach the post in the middle, wishing to be on the ground. \n Daniel is quickly\
  \ by my side, having enjoyed his first bridge, and grinning in the heat. My knees\
  \ begin to shake, in a comical way, literally knocking together. I stare at them\
  \ in disbelief. \n \u2018I can\u2019t do this.\u2019 I say to Daniel, trying to\
  \ remain calm. \n \u2018You can!\u2019 he responds, as children pass us, running\
  \ onto the next bridge, filled with confidence. I clutch my stomach. Either, I follow\
  \ Daniel over the bridges, which I know climb until you are above the trees, or,\
  \ I take a chance on finding my own way back through Taman Negara rainforest. Hastily,\
  \ I choose the latter. I cannot go on. I turn and walk away from Daniel, back across\
  \ the smallest canopy bridge. He calls after me.\n \u2018Take some more water!\u2019\
  \n But I cannot turn around. I am too afraid. Alone, I descend into the forest below."
