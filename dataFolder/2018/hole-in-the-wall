Text: "This Canyon is in the Mojave Desert National Preserve in Southern California.\
  \  It was established in October of 1994.\nHow Hole in the Wall got its name: The\
  \ black and reddish-grey lava formation got its holes because gases from eruptions\
  \ were captured and cooled unevenly, creating spectacular caverns.\nIt was a hot\
  \ Saturday morning in September when I left my home in Santa Monica, California\
  \ to drive to Mitchell Caverns in the Mohave Desert. I was anticipating having a\
  \ great time.\nI stopped overnight in Barstow, where I got a taste of how hot that\
  \ area really could get.  The next morning I continued on the I-15 to the I-40 to\
  \ Goffs Road, exited at Essex Road, and drove 10 miles on a dirt road named Black\
  \ Canyon Road.  I passed a BLM sign that read:  Hole in the Wall. \nAt Mitchell\
  \ Caverns, the sign said: Closed for the Season.\nDisappointed, I decided to check\
  \ out Hole in the Wall.  I drove slowly so I wouldn\u2019t miss the turn.  When\
  \ I arrived, I thought:  Great.\nThe elevation ranged from 880 to 7,492\u2019. \
  \ When I looked down at my car, it was the size of a box of matches  I wondered\
  \ how high I was, and yes heat rises. \nI walked the Rings Trail which had loose\
  \ and slippery lava \u201Ccrumbs\u201D until I saw a Slot Canyon, a natural rock\
  \ formation. I noticed O rings that the BLM had mounted to help people climb up\
  \ and down.\nWhen I got to the bottom, I thought I was on another planet:  The grass\
  \ was ankle deep, and there was a rusted-out truck. I sat on the truck hood drinking\
  \ fruit juice and water, enjoying the view and the critters who lived there, watching\
  \ for rattlesnakes. \nI looked up at the top of the surrounding lava, noticed cacti\
  \ which I later identified as barrel and cholla cacti.  I heard little feet on the\
  \ rusted truck and noticed alligator lizards and scorpions racing around.  I sat\
  \ motionless and watched them do their thing on their turf.  Fortunately for me,\
  \ they ignored me. I decided to leave before my luck ran out.\nAs I stood at the\
  \ base of the canyon, I realized to get out I had to use those O rings which looked\
  \ too high for me to reach.  As I used them to climb I discovered they were about\
  \ 6 feet apart, while I am 5 feet tall. \nI reminded myself to watch where I put\
  \ my hands on the rocks for support to avoid being bitten by a snake or lizard.\
  \  With a lot of grunting and groaning and wishing I had packed a dry shirt, I finally\
  \ climbed out, finished the fruit juice, and lay down to rest.   As I drove home,\
  \ I felt excited about exploring a Slot Canyon."
