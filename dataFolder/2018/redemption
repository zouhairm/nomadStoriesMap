Text: "\u201CRedemption?\u201D The taxi driver joked as the early morning darkness\
  \ filled our cab.  I said nothing as the car weightlessly weaved through the quite\
  \ streets.  The emblematic song of honking horns, beckoning sirens and motorcycles\
  \ bidding their demands to the Eternal City were silenced at 5:30AM.\nStarring out\
  \ my window his question embodied my thoughts. Could it be expectations only to\
  \ see something I had never seen before that brought me out to see the Vatican that\
  \ morning or was it something else. My young daughter by my side at this odd hour\
  \ avoiding the masses clamoring for entry that had denied us our last chance to\
  \ this hallowed ground.   \nCoffee first, always coffee first, asking our driver\
  \ to drop us at the only Caf\xE9 in sight nearby.  Rushing through my order with\
  \ a sense of being late I asked for my dixie cup \u201CTake Away\u201Dand my daughter\
  \ and I walked with purpose towards our destination. The massiveness of what was\
  \ unmistakably one of the most majestic buildings I had ever seen came into view\
  \ as the chill in the air hit my face.     \nApproaching the Basilica, the reality\
  \ of where we were hit me.  There were no deadened commonalities of \u201Cawe- struck\u201D\
  \ strangers sharing our moment with us. I had a sense that we were seeing something\
  \ much more intimate and alluring and edging closer I heard a voice pierce through\
  \ the still air.  I knew instantly that I had stumbled upon something ageless, ancient,\
  \ as chanting rang through the darkness.  As our steps grew closer a single figure,\
  \ in the long black robe of a priest, occupied the middle of the abandoned square.\
  \  Knelled with hands held high and his head facing the heavens as he cried out\
  \ \u201CHallelujah, Hallelujah\u201D again and again. The words permeated everything\
  \ and were palpable down to my core.  The hairs on the back of my neck rose up and\
  \ what felt like thunder against my chest I thought to myself, \u201CDon\u2019t\
  \ lose this moment.\u201D  It was not the time to grab my camera or take a video.\
  \  It was a moment to be present in. To be with my beautiful little girl and share\
  \ an experience of a lifetime.  As I stood my heartbeat slowed, sounds drowned out,\
  \ my field of vision honed in and for a moment I was not outside of this place,\
  \ this once center of the world encasement of history I was a part of it.  Is this\
  \ not why we travel? To become one with the road, to touch and feel something larger\
  \ than our own back yards and hence bring ourselves back into the fold, redeemed,forever\
  \ changed and then returned to our true north, home."
