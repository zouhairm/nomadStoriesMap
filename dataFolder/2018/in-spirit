Text: "The pen dangles between my fingers, feathery blue strokes marring the page\
  \ with each gust of air from the creaking fan. The dismal sight of the blank page\
  \ screams silently of the betrayal of my words. My brain starts to fill the pit\
  \ of despair with senseless images and sounds. The latest pop music video of gyrating\
  \ hips, an aesthetic cry for help for our world\u2019s lost ability to love. The\
  \ safety pin latched onto my mother\u2019s bangles, the sole knight in shining armor\
  \ that ever came to my rescue. Figments of a memory from my childhood flit before\
  \ my eyes. My mind plays the twirling skirts and blurry faces in a loop, a derelict\
  \ reel stuck at the only salvageable part. \nI drag a shoebox from under my bed,\
  \ a habit that bled into reality from young adult novels. Attempts at teenage popularity\
  \ nest within the gift paper wrapped cardboard. Just like my memory, the photograph\
  \ is also tinged in sepia, still carrying a whiff of the sea. This time the words\
  \ fall into place. I leave the letter weighed down by a Buddha statue and walk out\
  \ the house. \nI take out the photograph the moment the bus starts its journey towards\
  \ the sea. The crease made in my mind from that beautiful day has long been smoothed\
  \ out by daydreams and everyday struggles. The last straggling rays light up the\
  \ sky with a beautiful amalgamation of pink and orange. The stars become more distinct\
  \ as dusk turns to night and I cannot stop thinking how beautiful the sky will look\
  \ as a lehenga. The bus is driving me away from a wedding that I cannot stop imagining.\
  \ \nThe wedding is no longer a young girl\u2019s fantasy, but a nightmarish reality\
  \ that I thought I was impervious to. My mind replays my father\u2019s purple face,\
  \ spit flying everywhere as he yells, astonished at my blatant refusal to go along\
  \ with his idea of a match made in heaven. My mother\u2019s steely eyes and pursed\
  \ mouth relay the story of her disappointment. I cannot reconcile the memories of\
  \ my parents from the past twenty years with the two strangers standing in front\
  \ of me. The decision to escape the forced marriage was easy. It was the wrinkled\
  \ face in the photograph that gave me the courage to do it. \nMy grandmother smiles\
  \ back at me, her smile frozen in the photograph taken two days before her death.\
  \ Yet, I can feel her warm caress and hear her whispers of encouragement as she\
  \ guides me to the sea. The sea was her home, and she was mine."
