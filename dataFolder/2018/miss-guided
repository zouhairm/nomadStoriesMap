Text: "The last thing I expected was to miss my flight from Spain to Toronto, jump\
  \ on a plane to Lisbon instead, run into my highschool writing teacher at baggage\
  \ claim and get a ride into a city that would surprise me; indulge me; excite me.\
  \ I suppose that never would have happened had I not pushed past the fear of having\
  \ absolutely no idea what I was doing - I had nothing planned and no information\
  \ about where I was going. This was a first. So there, in the lobby of my teacher\u2019\
  s much-too-expensive-for-me hotel, I borrowed the wifi and googled \u201Cbest hostel\
  \ in Lisbon\u201D. It really was. Right by the water... what water? I had no idea,\
  \ but I\u2019d eventually take a sweaty stroll \u2014 it was August \u2014 through\
  \ the Praca di Commercio to get to it. So as I was saying, the hostel was great,\
  \ except for the fact they had no rooms available \u2014 at least not for that night.\
  \  Neither did their sister hostel 5mins away. Enter: Chilean girl, about my age,\
  \ just in from the airport. She had missed her reservation the day before and failed\
  \ to notify them that she wasn\u2019t going to make it until the next day. Long\
  \ story short, they didn\u2019t have a room for her either. Worn out from lugging\
  \ around three bags and in survival mode, I walked up to the girl, introduced myself\
  \ and asked if she was down to split a room at a fancy hotel I\u2019d noticed down\
  \ the street. She was in. So, we booked the only room they had left at 250 Euros\
  \ a night. We later realized that the Cr 7 in the hotel name stood for \u201Cthis\
  \ place is owned by the famous soccer player, Christian Ronaldo.\u201D Oh. And so\
  \ the adventure began to unravel. That first night in Portugal, I had the best white\
  \ wine sangria of my life \u2014complete with chunky, diced fruit piled at the bottom\
  \ of my glass and cinnamon sticks swirling around in it. However, nothing beat the\
  \ crispy, creamy, warm, cinnamon and sugar-coated Pastel de Nata straight from the\
  \ famous bakery in Belem. So, I ate my way through Time Out Market and LxFactory.\
  \  I eventually made it into the more-affordable hostel, where I met people from\
  \ everywhere and together we roadtripped to the most western point of Europe - Cabo\
  \ da Roca... cliffs, ocean, sunset. We climbed the 75-degree-angled streets of Old\
  \ Lisbon. We explored Sintra \u2014 the Quinta da Regaleira palace and peeked over\
  \ a wall at Madonna\u2019s Moorish Mansion. We froze in the water at Praia Cascais.\
  \ We danced into the morning and made friends on the slippery, cobble-stoned streets\
  \ of Bairro Alto. I didn\u2019t expect any of it, but it was magic."
