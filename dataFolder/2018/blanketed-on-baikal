Text: "I ducked behind the rails of the ship in an attempt to escape the biting offshore\
  \ winds; I shivered as I watched the Maloe More Strait melt into a postmeridian\
  \ horizon. When we left Khuzir village that morning it was bright out and the water\
  \ was clear enough to see the rocks below. Now, the sun was waning into the Taiga\
  \ forests of the Baikal Mountains and the lake was a mirror of the graying sky.\
  \  \n\n\"Bednaya devushka!\" I heard a voice coo from behind me. I turned to see\
  \ a middle-aged woman motioning her marigold pashmina toward me. \u201CPoor girl,\u201D\
  \ she offered again, this time in a heavily accented English. \n\n\u201CAh, nyet,\
  \ nyet, spasiba,\u201D I responded in my own broken-Russian, in an attempt to politely\
  \ refuse her shawl. She watched me with imploring eyes, her head cocked and lips\
  \ downturned into an embellished frown. She clicked her tongue in disapproval and\
  \ walked toward me, wrapping me in a strong, blanketed hug. I jumped in surprise.\
  \ She held onto me tighter. \n\nI thought back to just two weeks earlier when my\
  \ partner, Ivan, and I arrived in Russia. We had just come to Novosibirsk, Siberia\u2019\
  s unofficial capital, when a woman physically lifted me from the sidewalk and moved\
  \ me out of her way. I was indignant. \n\n\"She picked me up!\" I hissed at Ivan,\
  \ much to his amusement. \u201CShe didn\u2019t even say \u2018izviniteh!\u2019\u201D\
  \ I sputtered, in an exaggerated show of surprise. He watched me, patiently, as\
  \ I reminded him how little I\u2019d heard this word since we arrived in Russia,\
  \ a word that interestingly can translate to both \u201Cexcuse me,\u201D and \u201C\
  I\u2019m sorry.\u201D\n\n\u201CShe meant nothing by it,\u201D he said, laughing\
  \ and offering a shrug, \u201Cyou were just in her way. Welcome to Russia.\u201D\
  \n\nIt wasn\u2019t until this moment, on a boat in the middle of Lake Baikal, that\
  \ Ivan\u2019s earlier statement made sense to me. There, engulfed in the arms of\
  \ a stranger, I understood what it meant to be welcomed to Russia. I understood\
  \ that the beauty of that country is in its steadfast personality and the contradictions\
  \ that come along with it. By my American standards, Russians seemed blunt, physically\
  \ intrusive, and unapologetic\u2014but it is that very frankness that finds you\
  \ welcomed into homes and hugs, and it is that unapologetic nature that proves sincerity.\
  \ It means you might take a shove on the street but, if you give it some time, you\
  \ may also get blanketed on Baikal."
