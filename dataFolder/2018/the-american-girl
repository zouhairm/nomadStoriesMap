Text: "I spend the first day in Montevideo speaking to anyone who looks bored or friendly.\
  \ An outdoor restaurant hostess tells me Uruguay produces cows and software, cattle\
  \ and code. \n\nColorful prints of paintings litter the bookshops I visit.\n\nIf\
  \ I were a painter: purple Uruguayans in a cattle field, small iPad screens glowing\
  \ faint blue as the people write code beneath a lavender sky.\n\nI decide to visit\
  \ Colonia del Sacramento\u2014from there: Buenos Aires. \n\nIn Colonia I shop, drink\
  \ coffee, get the jitters, attempt to break into the cultural center closed for\
  \ construction and shoo a stray dog that climbs onto a window sill to sit unloved.\
  \ \n\nI see a young man behind a glass counter on a computer in a marijuana dispensary.\
  \ I enter. \n\n\u201CHey. May I charge my phone?\u201D I ask in Spanish. \n\n\u201C\
  Sure.\u201D\n\nI plug my phone in and sit on the black leather couch across from\
  \ the counter. \n\nShe appears in the doorway: navy crocs, blue wool socks; skinny\
  \ jeans; ironed periwinkle crew neck sweater; prescription D&G glasses; wide smile.\n\
  \n\u201CHi!\u201D she says to us in enthusiastic native English.\n\n\u201CHello,\u201D\
  \ the man replies.\n\n\u201CI\u2019m from California!\u201D she says.\n \n\u201C\
  The Golden State!\u201D I say to her from the couch in English.\n\nHe turns to me.\
  \ \n\n\u201CYou\u2019re from where?\u201D he asks me in Spanish.\n\n\u201CThe United\
  \ States.\u201D \n\nWe look back at the girl. \n\n\u201CYou speak English?\u201D\
  \ she asks me, slowly and loudly.\n\nHe stifles his laughter by clearing his throat.\
  \ \n\n\u201CCan I buy weed?\u201D she asks him.\n\n\u201CWe don\u2019t sell to foreigners.\u201D\
  \n\nHis English sounds like an Argentine\u2019s I once knew. \n\nShe stands beaming.\
  \ \u201CToo bad. Bye now!\u201D\n\nThe back of my throat ignites in crackling thirst.\
  \ I taste salt. Homesickness. I look at the man. He\u2019s suspicious, waiting for\
  \ me to step out of my skin and reveal that I\u2019m really the American girl who\
  \ just left. \n\nI straighten my shoulders, stand and walk to the counter. \n\n\u201C\
  I watched this pot documentary on the Discovery Channel when I was a teenager,\u201D\
  \ I say in my best Spanish. \n\n\u201COh?\u201D he says. \n\n\u201CPot was an aquatic\
  \ plant. Made its way to California\u2019s coast. It\u2019s like it wanted to be\
  \ consumed.\u201D I say with wide eyes. \n\nHe looks at me as if I were a strange\
  \ painting.\n\n\u201CI think it floated to Argentina, too,\u201D I continue. \u201C\
  Beautiful country, no?\u201D\n\nHe lowers his head, examining a smudge on the counter.\
  \ \n\n\u201CYou think so?\u201D he asks. \n\n\u201CI do. Hey,\u201D I lean closer\
  \ toward him, \u201Cyou\u2019re not Uruguayan, are you?\u201D\n\nHe studies me,\
  \ and I feel at home in his gaze.\n\n\u201CI\u2019m Argentine,\u201D he says. \u201C\
  Want to smoke?\u201D"
