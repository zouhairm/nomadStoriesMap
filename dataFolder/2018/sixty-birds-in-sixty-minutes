Text: "I was in the Gambia, stomping down a hot, dusty highway with my freshly-minted\
  \ husband, for the first time in my life thankful for the British Commonwealth.\
  \ I had idiotically assumed Australians didn\u2019t need Senegalese visas. I was\
  \ wrong. \nFrantically poring over the map a day or two before we were due to depart\
  \ on our honeymoon, we realised the country next door to Senegal was, like our own,\
  \ an ex-British colony, and we could fly in visa free. So there we were in the Gambia,\
  \ haunting the tiny hut that was the Senegalese embassy as we awaited our visas,\
  \ until we finally got fed up with fending off the local hustlers and took a bus\
  \ out of Senegambia to a village I\u2019d heard had good birdwatching.  \nIt was\
  \ nice enough, but the birds must have been napping, and a long trek through the\
  \ adjacent national park the next day had been equally quiet on the avian front.\
  \ I was downcast-here we were, having inadvertently landed in one of the best birding\
  \ spots in Africa, with nothing but time on our hands, and barely a feather in sight.\
  \ \nNow, trudging down the road to town 30 kilometres away, sticky, sunburnt, thirsty,\
  \ with no idea of the bus timetable, we decided it was time to stick out our thumbs.\
  \ Almost immediately a smart white minivan pulled over, and a rotund, jolly-looking\
  \ gent peered out the window. \n\u201CHello! I am Yaya Barry,\u201D he told us.\
  \ \u201CI am named after the president of the Gambia. Would you like a ride into\
  \ town?\u201D\nWe agreed, most fervently, that we did. Climbing into the cool, air-conditioned\
  \ car I took the binoculars from around my neck. \n\u201CYou are birders?\u201D\
  \ Yaya enquired. \n\u201CExtremely amateur,\u201D I told him. \u201CSo amateur we\u2019\
  ve barely seen any at all.\u201D\n\u201CI am not just named after the Gambian President,\
  \ I am also the President myself-of the Gambian Birdwatchers Association. I will\
  \ show you our birds right now. I can promise you sixty birds in sixty minutes.\u201D\
  \nYaya was as good as his word, and we drove straight to the local sewage farm,\
  \ a series of lush, surprisingly non-pungent lily-pad strewn ponds surrounded by\
  \ looming hotels, where the Gambian birdwatching association had erected what looked\
  \ like a two-storey cubbyhouse in which to hold their meetings. \nOur kindly host\
  \ took us for a gentle sunset amble, pointing out the looming vultures, jewel-like\
  \ kingfishers, water-walking jacanas and awkward storks\u2013sixty different birds,\
  \ in fact, in just under an hour. From no birds to a bird a minute\u2013it was the\
  \ last thing we expected in a place we never expected to be."
