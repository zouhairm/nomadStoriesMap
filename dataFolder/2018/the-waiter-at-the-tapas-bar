Text: "It was my second day in Madrid and now, sitting in this tapas bar my guidebook\
  \ had recommended, I was on the verge of tears. I thought that in moving to Spain\
  \ I could move away from my problems, but that pesky phrase was haunting me: wherever\
  \ you go, there you are. \n I was tired from a long studious day at El Museo del\
  \ Prado and thinking (again! STILL!) about the guy who broke my heart (eleven months\
  \ ago!). I was also the only person alone in that crowded, loud, Saturday night\
  \ restaurant. I felt completely pathetic. \n I fought my way to a spot at the bar\
  \ where I huddled and hoped nobody would notice me sulking, sipping my wine. The\
  \ happy clamor of Spanish voices filled the room, and the yellow walls seemed to\
  \ glow in the warm light. Rows of wine bottles shimmered down at me. The young men\
  \ to my right seemed friendly and good-humored. Possibility was everywhere, but\
  \ I was too gloomy to seize it. The moody dryness of the wine mingled with the sharp\
  \ tangy crunch of olives and tiny pickles from my tapas plate. The tableau of brooding\
  \ flavors matched my emotions perfectly. \n \u201CDe d\xF3nde eres?\u201D a waiter\
  \ asked, where are you from? I wanted to be left alone, but I didn\u2019t want to\
  \ be rude, so I answered. He smiled and turned to attend to a different customer,\
  \ giving me my space. But a few minutes later he set a glass down in front of me\
  \ and filled it with moscato. I looked up, puzzled when he slid it towards me. \u201C\
  On the house,\u201D he proclaimed as he laughed and winked conspiratorially. \n\
  \ The drinks and gentle attention gradually relaxed me. The waiter came back to\
  \ chat and in the course of the conversation he discovered I was in an a cappella\
  \ group. He started beat-boxing to goad me into singing. To my surprise, I was having\
  \ a pleasant time. When he invited me to go for a drink after his shift I uncharacteristically\
  \ agreed.\n Later, as we strolled down the streets where cobblestones glimmered\
  \ in the stark sultry lamplight, I leaned against him and reveled in the sound of\
  \ his voice, silky and deep like black olives. The city seemed to stand still around\
  \ us in spite of the cheerful, buoyant hum of nightlife. By the lookout point in\
  \ the park he kissed me, and I made my way home wondering if my dizziness came from\
  \ the wine or his lips. \n It didn\u2019t matter that our entanglement only lasted\
  \ a month or that there was still more of my heartbroken slump to battle through.\
  \ Meeting him was the jumpstart I needed to let go of my troubles and immerse myself\
  \ in the magic of Spain."
