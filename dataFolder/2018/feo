Text: "I had just been in the hospital on New Year\u2019s Eve. I had a kidney infection,\
  \ I had gained weight and had an emotionally distraught year from friendships falling\
  \ apart to not having the best family relationship all during one of my hardest\
  \ years of Architecture School. I applied to study abroad, it had been a dream since\
  \ I was kid. I chose Mexico City, for financial as well as personal reasons. I wanted\
  \ to know where my family roots started. My mother was born in Mexico City, her\
  \ family had toured throughout the country because their father was an architect.\
  \ My mother and brother joined me in heading down to Mexico to help me get settled.\
  \ I remember flying in, seeing the density of the houses, I felt sick on a plane\
  \ for the first time ever. I was small town girl who was born on a border town,\
  \ and now I was going to live in a city with 30 million people. We visited the school\
  \ and asked about student housing, we heard about a lady down the street that was\
  \ going to start an all-girls dorm. I remember walking into her third story house\
  \ which was within a family compound. A little white fluffy puppy 8 wks old came\
  \ running up to me. I fell immediately in love with him. He had just been saved\
  \ from the witches market a few days prior, had a few sicknesses and a battle with\
  \ survival. The lady said her daughter needed a dog for a high school experiment\
  \ and after the class was over they were going get rid of him, I was appalled. I\
  \ immediately said I will keep him, I will train him and take care of him and he\
  \ shall return to the states with me. It was the last thing I expected. I was nowhere\
  \ near prepared to have a pet, I was 21 and studying abroad. I named him Feo, which\
  \ means ugly in Spanish, don't worry he is not ugly, his handsome looks and character\
  \ melt my heart daily. Anytime I would come home from school I would whistle, he\
  \ would run down the stairs crying, he was a crazy puppy who destroyed a lot. I\
  \ would lay him on my chest to hear my heartbeat to calm him, which became his form\
  \ of affection. After 6 months of playing basketball for the University, traveling\
  \ around Meixco, and getting my health back on track; It was time for Feo and I\
  \ to head back to the states. The rules for him to leave Mexico were much more strict\
  \ than arriving to the States, not one question was asked upon arrival. Feo is now\
  \ 13 years old, he loves the beach, loves hanging out at bars and we now live in\
  \ Denver. Most people would say I saved him, without a doubt Feo saved me."
