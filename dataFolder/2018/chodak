Text: "\u201CYou see that peak? The one which looks like a horse\u2019s head?\u201D\
  \ said Jamyang. \u201CThe temple is right on the other side.\u201D\nThe wind had\
  \ given us a rest and the sun was shining, almost hard enough to warm us up. Instead\
  \ of looking where he told me, I kept staring at the scar on his right temple. As\
  \ if it were lightning, the image of the Chinese army entering his village came\
  \ to me. I saw the soldiers taking his father away amidst his mother\u2019s cries\
  \ of helplessness, then the mother\u2019s last wail when he was shot and felt to\
  \ the ground with a sharp thud, while the smell of burning houses was engulfing\
  \ the village. I then imagined Jamyang being forced to witness his mother being\
  \ harassed, just before been knocked out with a sudden, abject blow.\nOf course,\
  \ all that was a product of my imagination. But the fact was that many villages\
  \ in Tibet had been flattened by the invading army. And, coming from a country which\
  \ had not long ago suffered a war, I knew that people may be reluctant to talk.\
  \ That's why I didn\u2019t dare ask Jamyang anything.\n\u201CThat\u2019s where we\
  \ are heading to.\u201D I came back to reality as his smooth voice caressed me and\
  \ his smiling blue eyes met mine.\n\nWe hiked along the valley, where horses were\
  \ grazing, taking advantage of the melting snow and the flourishing soil, while\
  \ shepherds waved at us with their everlasting smile and the sound of nearby streams\
  \ reached our ears.\nAs we began climbing, flora became more and more scarce, and\
  \ even the air had a different smell. We were suddenly challenged by an impressive,\
  \ almost upright slope, and eventually reached the temple, a one-storey, wooden\
  \ construction, well hidden in the cavity of the mountain. This was probably the\
  \ reason why it had survived the burning and bombing of the army.\nThe door was\
  \ open, and so we went in. Right there, waiting for us, was the monk, in his red\
  \ habit, his head shaved, oozing peace through every inch of his body.\n\u201CWelcome\
  \ home,\u201D he told us calmly with a broad, friendly smile.\nGlancing quickly\
  \ over the room, a photograph on the wall grabbed my attention. When I came closer\
  \ I was so taken aback that I almost fell to my knees. Was it really my grandfather?\
  \ He was wearing the same red habit, a wide, calm expression on his face. But there\
  \ was no doubt. That sparkle of his eyes, that smile, were the same as the last\
  \ time I saw him, before he disappeared, more than fifteen years ago.\n\u201CThat\u2019\
  s Chodak, a monk who came from the Pyrenees,\u201D I heard behind me. \u201CHe\u2019\
  ll be back tomorrow from his voyage.\u201D"
