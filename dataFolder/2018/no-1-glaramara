Text: "I arrived in Stonethwaite, a village in the North-Western Lake District, 5\
  \ miles outside of Keswick just after 12pm. While parking the car, I thought back\
  \ to when I would camp by the river at the far end of the village, overlooked by\
  \ an imposing fell. I came back specifically to conquer this barren landscape feature.\
  \ It is called Glaramara.\n\nAware that time was against me and the weather was\
  \ forecast as icy, rainy and windy, I quickly changed into my waterproofs and walking\
  \ boots, packing light for a quick ascent. My 'plan' was to reach the summit of\
  \ Glaramara and then drop down the Hind Gill path to circle back around to the car.\
  \ I don't know what the exact distance is, but I\u2019m guessing around 6 miles.\n\
  \nAfter a quick chat with a local man and his Scottish Terrier, I set off for the\
  \ base of Glaramara at 12.35pm, giving me just under four hours of daylight to reach\
  \ the summit and get back to my car. Turning left at Chapel Farm, I stepped onto\
  \ the track that runs up to \u2018Tarn At Leaves\u2019 \u2013 I planned to jump\
  \ a seemingly small stream to access my intended path, but ended out sliding across\
  \ the rocks of a heavy-flowing waterfall (learning my first lesson that day on not\
  \ taking the weather seriously!). I reached the other side surprisingly dry and\
  \ extremely hot! I stopped to remove my jumper, carrying on in a T-shirt and waterproof\
  \ jacket \u2013 confident that I was generating enough heat from the steep walk\
  \ that I didn't require the extra layer (this turned out to be the 2nd Lesson of\
  \ the day on not taking the weather seriously!).\n\nTwo thirds of the way up, a\
  \ freezing fog and rain descended. This was a great time to discover that my waterproof\
  \ jacket had effectively retired, and I was soon soaked to the bone! I pushed on,\
  \ losing the path once more before summiting at around 3pm. By this time it was\
  \ impossible to find Hind Gill, because the heavy rain fall had turned the top of\
  \ Glaramara into a circulatory system of Gills, I crossed left to right and back\
  \ again, determined not to give up. Losing heat, I grabbed for my Jumper only to\
  \ discover that a decision not to buy a waterproof bag-cover was my third lesson\
  \ for the day - I was shaking uncontrollably and totally unable to find the path.\
  \ Reluctantly, I turned back and walked as fast as I could back down the way I had\
  \ come, arriving at the car as the sunlight disappeared completely.\n\nI have never\
  \ been so happy to see my Thermos Flask! Or more disappointed that I didn't fill\
  \ it up before I set off that morning."
