Text: "\"Can you show us where the husky section is?\" My grandmother had zero remorse\
  \ in her voice as she asked the first employee she could find at a local department\
  \ store in Edmonton, Alberta. Admittedly, I was slightly portly at fourteen but\
  \ husky? Come on Louise. I had struggled with anxiety for a few years now, maybe\
  \ it was a teenage thing and I'd outgrow it but right now it had reached what seemed\
  \ like an unbearable peak. I had handled my issues with it quite well up until now,\
  \ having just gotten on an airplane for the first time in my life, alone, and flown\
  \ over two thousand miles to visit my lovely grandmother for a few weeks. This should\
  \ have been no problem but it left me teary eyed and embarrassed as I reluctantly\
  \ fiddled my way through a rack of thick flannel shirts in the \"husky\" section.\
  \  \n\nFast forward about six days and Louise and I are riding a gondola up Sulphur\
  \ Mountain in the utterly breathtaking Canadian Rockies. At fourteen I had not known\
  \ what it was yet to be awed by anything outside of the latest and greatest video\
  \ game of the time but this, this was something I knew was special and I couldn't\
  \ help but be astounded by every inch of my surroundings. At an elevation of a little\
  \ over eight thousand feet this was by no means a Mount Fuji or Kilimanjaro but\
  \ to my young eyes it was a stairway straight up into the stars. My grandmother,\
  \ slow and steady, exited as I rushed out the door with reckless abandon. There\
  \ was a small rocky trail leading further up the mountain to the actual summit and\
  \ I started up it at once. Louise did not like this one bit. We bickered back and\
  \ forth momentarily until she realized it was an argument she was trying to win\
  \ in vein. Before she could reluctantly finish her sentence allowing me my freedom,\
  \ I was off.  \n\nThis was quite the jaunt for me, being a husky lad and all. I\
  \ had no measure of distances or height at my age so what was initially a fantastic\
  \ wind of excitement quickly turned into a struggle to get wind of any sort in and\
  \ out of my body. My legs ached, my head pounded. Mid way up I sat on a large rock\
  \ and felt hopeless of reaching the top. Just then a familiar face tapped me on\
  \ the shoulder. It was the department store employee I had been so mortified in\
  \ front of just days ago. He offered some words of encouragement and a hiking partner\
  \ to reach the top. Reinvigorated, anxiety but an afterthought, I was on my way.\
  \ At the Summit I was speechless but for a thank you to my new friend."
