Text: "In 2010, I had my second open heart surgery.  I promised myself that if I ever\
  \ got back on my feet, I would visit at least two countries every year.  In 2016,\
  \ I visited Malaysia.\n\nI flew to Sarawak in Borneo.  Every day was its own adventure.\
  \  I visited rainforests, spotting monkeys and beached jellyfish looking like deflated\
  \ stars dotting the beach.  I saw the cat museum in Kuching that enshrines vintage\
  \ bags of Whiskas in glass.  \n\nThen, a guide came by my hostel and asked if I\
  \ wanted to visit the tribal villages.  There is a ceremony, he said.  It happens\
  \ once a year, and it is happening right now.  The last priestesses who know how\
  \ to do it are dying out.\n\nWe went deep into a rural area called Bau.  My guide,\
  \ Usop, explained that Bau meant \u201Csmell.\u201D  Colonists and natives had fought\
  \ bitterly until the rivers were filled with the dead, creating a stench.  But now,\
  \ the jungle had taken over and people could just pick fruit off trees for breakfast.\
  \  \u201CThe jungle is our grocery store,\u201D Usop said.  Everything was edible,\
  \ including sticky rice steamed in a delicate carnivorous pitcher plant.  There\
  \ was no electricity, and when night fell, the jungle was aglow with portable lamps\
  \ and candles.\n\nUsop\u2019s village was once a head-hunting tribe, but now only\
  \ a few elders kept the old spiritualism alive.  The spirit house was made of bamboo\
  \ and strained under the weight of not only the entire village, but neighboring\
  \ villages.  Gongs and drums pulsated, and a smoky altar to the harvest spirit took\
  \ up the main floor.  It was smeared with the blood of a freshly slaughtered pig.\
  \  Villagers crowded around, filming with cell phones.  They pressed closely to\
  \ the elderly priestesses who were dressed in their finest with bear teeth clattering\
  \ against their necks.  Usop asked me how I felt.  \n\nI surprised myself when I\
  \ answered because I had been so excited to experience something new.  \u201CThis\
  \ is depressing,\u201D I said.  Someone rammed a camera up against a stoic priestess\u2019\
  s face.  \u201CYour grandmother is being treated like an animal in a zoo.\u201D\
  \  As we talked, someone began playing a film of last year\u2019s festival, as if\
  \ for posterity, even as the current ceremony was taking place.\n\n\u201CTell somebody,\u201D\
  \ Usop said.  He explained I could tell Americans how the last of the last are treated.\
  \  He told me about how his grandmother\u2019s home had been burnt by missionaries.\
  \  He explained how no more priestesses would be chosen.  I said I would do my best.\
  \  \n\nAnd that is how I saw one of the last harvest festivals in Sarawak."
