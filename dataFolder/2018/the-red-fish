Text: "I was never one to take chances.  Most of the time, I still don\u2019t do anything\
  \ that I would consider to be out of my control.  But, one thing that I do know\
  \ how to do, is follow my gut.  The first time that I left the US, I knew where\
  \ I needed to go.  My entire life, there had been something.  Through meaningless\
  \ symbols, photos that I would see online, anywhere that I saw Rio De Janeiro, I\
  \ knew that it was calling my name. \nRio, the land of carnival, Christ the Redeemer,\
  \ the place where, to me, everything was magical.  I went there knowing that it\
  \ was a dangerous place for tourists, and it didn\u2019t help that I didn\u2019\
  t speak the language.  But it was everything that I thought it would be, each different\
  \ location compelling.  From the beauty in the sadness of the brightly colored favelas,\
  \ how incredibly soft the sand felt between my fingers, to the magnificent statue\
  \ that lurked over the city.\nIt wasn\u2019t until I found myself in the middle\
  \ of the ocean, on a boat with 20 strangers, that I fully understood how stunning\
  \ the world is.  It wasn\u2019t until I saw the islands sprawling the vast emerald\
  \ colored sea, that I knew what I wanted from my time on earth was to see all of\
  \ it.  \nI had never swum in the open ocean, but something about that clear, blue\
  \ water enthralled me.  It called me by name and I couldn\u2019t say no.  I stood\
  \ on the edge of the boat and dove without hesitation.  The air escaped my lungs\
  \ and my body turned cold.  I gasped for a second, unable to catch my breath, afraid\
  \ of what wonders lurked below me.  I remained there, trying to keep myself afloat\
  \ until I was able to retract my thoughts.\nWhat was below me?  Did it really matter?\
  \  In that time, I forgot about all of the what if\u2019s and began to simply swim.\
  \  I swum towards the land, naturally, although the water was so enticing. Although\
  \ I knew that I needed to turn around, forget my fears, and face that everlasting\
  \ deep, beautiful ocean.  \nIn that moment, as I timidly swam back out into the\
  \ deep, I saw the most beautiful fish that I had ever seen.  It was almost as this\
  \ instant was kismet.  It swam beside me, unafraid, its fire-red scales freckled\
  \ with little white dots, which will remain instilled in my memory.  We swam together,\
  \ and within a split second, there were all kinds of beautiful fish surrounding\
  \ me. \nI don\u2019t know how I ever got out of that water.  Had I not taken the\
  \ initiative and dove in, I never would have had the most remarkable moment of my\
  \ life.  All thanks to that little red fish."
