Text: "It started with a curry. \n\nAnd a stranger willing to get activated charcoal\
  \ tablets for a slightly greenish looking girl, semi comatose and smushed faced\
  \ in a cafe in Goa in the south of India.\n\nIn his early 40s with sun stained,\
  \ Sydney skin and a huge tattoo of Ganesh on his forearm, the man had spent a year\
  \ on his motorbike travelling India in the 90s. When there were water wells and\
  \ no wifi- a hedonistic 18 year old who would return to India annually after.\n\n\
  The next day I was riding half way across India on the back of a motorbike. Quite\
  \ literally, from Goa to central Hampi.\n\nRainforests gradually dispersed into\
  \ red rock, dotted with trees and Hindu temples in every colour. \n\nMy eyes were\
  \ streaming from the wind piercing my retinas and the visual overload unfolding\
  \ around me. A heartburn like, awed sensation. The dodgy helmet threatened to knock\
  \ me out as it ricocheted violently on my skull.\n\nWe wove with calculated recklessness\
  \ through cars, bikes, tuk tuks, cows, goats, rainbow trucks and carts with cows\
  \ carrying house sized hay bails. \n\nI did not see a single tourist that day as\
  \ we passed through the villages of Karnataka. Instead, beautiful women in saris\
  \ carrying baskets their weight on their heads and men yogi squatting in front of\
  \ their coloured shops playing cards. Huge families in vehicles designed with a\
  \ lesser human capacity in mind all stared at the pale girl on the back of the motorbike-\
  \ helmet long gone and blonde hair sailing behind with a hot pink om scarf. \n\n\
  Pastel pink roads lay alongside mustard coloured fields. This unfurled into the\
  \ intensity of orange on green, opposite colours creating a surreal plane- Jurassic\
  \ rocks on red earth with electric, alien green palms. \n\nA few wrong turns and\
  \ 8 hours of travelling later the reckless bravery of a 21 year old was weakening\
  \ and an awareness of my own mortality took hold. A cervically damaging harem pant\
  \ seam and motorcycle seat compressing my coccyx as well as the speed became disconcerting.\
  \ My face was blackened by diesel, save for blood shot eyes that had blinked through\
  \ bullet bugs. \n\nShaking from exhilaration and sensory exposure- 10 hours of riding\
  \ later, the entrance to Hampi was the most relieving and magical thing I've ever\
  \ seen. Not quite nighttime but after sunset, the history witnessing boulders stood\
  \ illuminated and Imposing next to ancient temples. Without the capacity to speak\
  \ I just marvelled and then heavily slept, awaiting the beautiful ruins that awaited\
  \ me tomorrow."
