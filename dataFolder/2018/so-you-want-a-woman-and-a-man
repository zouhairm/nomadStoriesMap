Text: "If I\u2019ve learned one thing while traveling; it\u2019s that even though\
  \ as humans we\u2019re all very different\u2026we\u2019re all very much the same.\
  \  We all like to eat, we all want to be happy, and we all want to feel good.  Thusly,\
  \ there are familiar things from home you can find abroad.  One fun thing I\u2019\
  ve tried to do is challenge myself to step outside the comfort zone and do something\
  \ completely ordinary, in unique and unordinary places.  I\u2019d had a haircut\
  \ and massage before, but never at the same place, same time, with possibly a man\
  \ AND a woman.\n\n Once I settled with the man on the street that I wasn\u2019t\
  \ looking for a three-way, I was ushered in and sat down for a head rub.  Only twenty-four\
  \ hours prior, I had been jogging down from Mt. Meru\u2019s airy 15,000 ft peak\
  \ to catch transport back into Arusha, Tanzania.  I was sore.  I felt deserving\
  \ of some me-time, so the recommendation for a cheap treatment brought me right\
  \ over.  Elizabeth would be taking care of me.\n\n \u201CTell your friends if you\
  \ like my service.\u201D  We were now in the smallest room I\u2019ve ever seen.\
  \  On one side of a sliding plastic door, was a shower, toilet, shelves, and crock\
  \ pot.  On the other side was a padded table that filled wall-to-wall, with just\
  \ enough wiggle room to get from side to side.  Pronounced Eee-liz-a-beet, my new\
  \ and very close friend began to unbutton my vest for me.  \u201CNo worries, I\u2019\
  m here for you.\u201D  I thought of many things then, and pondered when was the\
  \ last time someone had helped me out of my clothes.  Too long, I realized, as she\
  \ slipped my pants off.  To no-one in particular I simply said, \u201CGotta trust\
  \ the process right?\u201D\n\n For all of the potential build-up, it was an extremely\
  \ regular massage in every way.  Even afterwards when she told me she was going\
  \ to help me shower, she simply pointed out the towels and how to lock the door\
  \ behind her as she left.  All I wanted, was to collect a crazy story of awkwardly\
  \ shooting down a rogue masseuse pressuring me with the mythical \u2018Happy-Ending\u2019\
  .  Never have I sought it, but the poorly phrased English and my 13 year old mindset\
  \ were convincing me that African massage was going to give me a story for the ages.\n\
  \n With a bit of massage oil in my hair and a spring in my step I moved to the front\
  \ room to start my African haircut.  I laughed as I showed the barber what I wanted\
  \ for style.  Not because of anything that had happened, nor the potential for a\
  \ crazy cut.  Because in the end, it turned out I was going to get both the woman,\
  \ AND the man."
