Text: "I closed my eyes, took a breath. I could hear the water lapping against the\
  \ boat and felt the spray tickling back at my legs. The sun on my back was warm\
  \ and encouraging. Eyes open. Exhale. \nI could hear the people already in the water\
  \ encouraging me to jump in already. As I looked down, all I could see was gorgeous\
  \ blue, then black. I\u2019d been in the ocean before but I\u2019d never jumped\
  \ off a boat. Jumped into nothing. I remembered stepping through security at the\
  \ airport. It was a similar sensation to this one, fear, excitement, wondering if\
  \ I\u2019d be okay. As I sat at my boarding gate I realized my parents were in a\
  \ car heading away from me. I was completely alone and in charge of myself. I was\
  \ eighteen, away from home for the first time, deciding if I should swim somewhere\
  \ in the middle of the Ionian Sea. \nI looked back at land. The beach looked so\
  \ welcoming, warm sand framed by hills dotted with shrubbery. There were boats anchored\
  \ in the bay, could I swim to them if my jump went wrong? I had sat on the beach\
  \ this morning waiting and watched the sunrise over the opening of the bay. The\
  \ green-blue sea that looked so inviting and safe had somehow turned into my biggest\
  \ fear. \nI\u2019ve jumped into ominous waters many times since that day. I still\
  \ think it\u2019s one of the scariest things to do. Plunging ourselves into a something\
  \ where we can\u2019t see the bottom, can\u2019t see what\u2019s hiding? It\u2019\
  s not natural. Humans have an instinct for survival and thrusting yourself into\
  \ things willy-nilly doesn\u2019t feel like the best way to achieve a very long\
  \ life.\nBut, as I discovered, it just might be the best way to achieve an exciting\
  \ life.\nEvery time I jump into the water I close my eyes and take a second to remember\
  \ doing it that first time. It stuck with me. I went away for a month thinking I\u2019\
  d come back and that would be the end of it. I\u2019d go to university, find a good\
  \ corporate job. Settle down. Take two weeks of vacation a year. Standing on the\
  \ edge of that boat? None of that felt good enough anymore. I wanted to be adventurous.\
  \ \nAs I inhaled I felt the salty air deep into my lungs. I took a few steps back\
  \ and, with a running start, I jumped."
