Text: "Going to a foreign place where the money is also foreign. Never knowing what\
  \ may happen, taking risks of hikes to the high top of a mountain to see the entire\
  \ island flourishing. Eating foods that are different taste and texture not knowing\
  \ if it\u2019s okay to eat, but feeling safe with the words of the happy people\
  \ greeting you and sharing their stories of the land you visit. Island girl on a\
  \ island learning the island way. The Cook Islands where the weather and seasons\
  \ are similar to the states and Hawaii, but different when it comes to speaking\
  \ to one another. The sun rays over the clear blue ocean with sea creatures greeting\
  \ you hello as you step through the rippling small tides to reach the break of the\
  \ waves. Out there are more sea creatures one you grew up knowing, but can remember\
  \ as much. There are cautious rules to be taken is what they say and be careful\
  \ don\u2019t let the spikey looking one poke you or you will have a terrible experience.\
  \ Oh, as much as I wanted to back out I didn\u2019t. We continued and saw many great\
  \ different sea life, but gets better when you snorkel a bit to see sea turtles\
  \ and little baby sharks swimming around you. Completely harmless, yet interesting\
  \ to the eye. In a way this is how everybody grew up, some lived off the land, some\
  \ turned to the helpful hand of civilization. The experience of wonders and disbelief\
  \ of what the world  holds."
