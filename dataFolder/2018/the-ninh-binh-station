Text: "As the sun was setting, leaving the sky shades of pink and grey, I stood in\
  \ front of the station contemplating what to do for the next five hours. I had just\
  \ finished a tour of Bai Dinh Pagoda in Ninh Binh, Vietnam. My tour group was returning\
  \ to Hanoi, where we had started the day, but I chose to travel south to Hue. I\
  \ convinced my tour driver to drop me off at the nearest train station and about\
  \ 40 minutes later I found myself in an empty parking lot.\n\nThe Ninh Bin train\
  \ station was in a surprisingly residential setting far from what a \u201Ctown center\u201D\
  \ would look like. It was surrounded by homes lining a few parallel streets and\
  \ a corner caf\xE9. With 6 hours until my train departure, I thought about venturing\
  \ into the corner caf\xE9 to access wifi. As I walked towards the cafe, something\
  \ urged me to keep going. I was curious and decided to explore the unfamiliar parallel\
  \ streets.\n\nA few minutes into wandering, a little girl stopped me. \u201CWhere\
  \ are you from\u201D, she asked. English was not Linh\u2019s first language and\
  \ her words were carefully selected, but we easily understood each other. Her mother,\
  \ who was standing by the doorway curiously, approached us. When she saw that we\
  \ were speaking English and that her daughter was able to converse in English, her\
  \ face lit up. I could see the excitement and pride in her eyes. In Vietnamese,\
  \ she spoke to Linh, who translated, \u201Cwill you come to our house for tea\u201D\
  ? I hesitated for a moment, questioning my safety, but I eventually gave in to Linh\u2019\
  s big smile and big eyes with black plastic-framed glasses. I spent the rest of\
  \ the evening with Linh\u2019s family. \n\nAfter tea, Linh\u2019s mother, Nguyen,\
  \ urged that I stay for dinner. I met Linh\u2019s brother and father. Sitting in\
  \ their home that evening, I was reminded of my own childhood; my dad coming home\
  \ from work, my older sisters and I coming home from school, and my family having\
  \ dinner together. Although, I was on the other side of the world with a family\
  \ who\u2019s language and culture were foreign, I could not feel any more the same.\
  \ \n\nNguyen set the table and not only did she serve what she had prepared for\
  \ dinner, but she also served food that the family had been storing for the upcoming\
  \ Vietnamese New Year. To surpass everything thus far, Nguyen packed food for my\
  \ overnight train journey to Hue. During my 7-month solo travel, many people asked\
  \ me, \u201Cdon\u2019t you miss home\u201D? I missed my family, of course, but how\
  \ could I miss home when too often, I already felt like I was there."
