Text: "\u201CJak sie masz?\u201D a snap from Borat\u2019s movie. That\u2019s the only\
  \ thing I knew about Kazakhstan when I found out I got a scholarship in Almaty.\
  \ The country\u2019s capital at that time. It\u2019s funny that actually \u201C\
  jak sie masz\u201C is Polish and it means \"how are you?\u201D So I thought that\
  \ it must be a sign.  I found out later Borat movie was shot in Romania and had\
  \ nothing to do with Kazakhstan.\n I decided to take a leap of faith and explore\
  \ this country, yet unknown to many people. Unfortunately me getting there was not\
  \ as easy as I expected.\nThings got complicated at my arrival at the Almaty airport\
  \ when I had misunderstood, thinking that I could get the visa on arrival. They\
  \ took me to a room with other people suspected of drug trafficking and God knows\
  \ what else for a four hours interrogation.  They were making me feel like a terrorist.\
  \ But after all this ordeal they \u201Ckindly\u201C released me and put me on a\
  \ flight back home to Vienna.\nBut the nightmare was not over. My suitcase got lost\
  \ somewhere between Istanbul and Vienna and it was never found. After careful consideration,\
  \ talking with the organization that got me the internship I decided to not give\
  \ up. So I bought another ticket again (hoping that I would be reimbursed later\
  \ by the organization). Applied for the visa and flew back to Almaty after a week\
  \ of waiting for the Visa to be ready. People at the embassy felt so bad for what\
  \ had happened to me that they gave me a DVD and travel book gift pack about their\
  \ country. One week later I was back on the plane to Almaty. \n\nLooking back now\
  \  I feel so happy I made this decision. Kazakhstan turned out to be really breathtaking.\
  \ I found the people very friendly and even though I could not understand much Russian,\
  \ even less Kazakh I made some great friends for life. In Almaty you find mountains,\
  \ lakes and you can do lot of hiking.  The traffic is absolutely crazy. I ended\
  \ up having to learn how to read cyrillic in order to follow the streets names and\
  \ try to not get lost. Thanks to the people I have met there, I was also able to\
  \ traveled to Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan. Countries that  turned out to have actually\
  \ a very similar culture to Polish. Bishkek reminded me a lot of Warsaw. \nI am\
  \ so glad I didn't give up and went ahead exploring those amazing countries of Central\
  \ Asia. Lesson learned. From now on I always double check where and when I should\
  \ get my Visas."
