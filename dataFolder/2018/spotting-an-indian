Text: "When I crossed over the Ponte della Costituzione in Venice on the summer of\
  \ 2016, I broke the ice with my co-traveller. It had been a long couple of days\
  \ when we were at odds with each other\u2019s opinion on something. As the gleaming\
  \ Venetian waters lazed under the little bridge, I asked Deepak if he\u2019d found\
  \ any Indians at all in the island until then. Over the previous weeks, we had been\
  \ travelling across Europe and it was not hard at all to spot one of our own at\
  \ any point of time. We even joked that the regional language of Mt. Titlis should\
  \ be declared Gujarati as we found tons of them when we visited it a couple of days\
  \ ago.\nWe settled on a bet wherein I would buy him a gelato of his favorite flavour,\
  \ lime if he spotted any Indians at all before we stepped out of the main island\
  \ of Venice and would return the favour if he did not. We spent the next four to\
  \ five hours exploring the narrow Venetian streets, amazed by its size and the little\
  \ bridges that ran over canals. We headed towards Piazza San Marco through the Rialto\
  \ bridge. \nNot one Indian, we could spot until then.\nThe sun was setting down\
  \ and bathing the city with golden yellow rays. We were entering the top of the\
  \ bell tower when I noticed an Indian couple. I knew I had to concede the loss but\
  \ fortune struck as the couple exited the tower before Deepak could spot them. I\
  \ breathed a sigh of relief. We spent the next hour and a half just after twilight\
  \ near the Punta della Dogana, watching the twilight blue being replaced by blackness.\n\
  We set-off towards to Piazzale di Roma quite late that we hardly found people on\
  \ the narrow streets. We passed through the streets I had earlier described with\
  \ huge number of positive adjectives which were looking eerie. When we reached a\
  \ large promenade of some sort, we were quite relieved coming out unscathed and\
  \ not turning up neck slit and dumped down a Venetian canal. \nSpotting an Indian\
  \ had been the last thing on our minds. But as we settled down near a closing food\
  \ stall and ordered Panini, we agreed that I won the bet with just an hour to mid-night\
  \ and few yards to cross the main island of Venice. Just as we were about to settle\
  \ our bill, the lady who served us asked if we were Indians. I nodded and the lady\
  \ asked where we were from in India.\n'Do you know Bangalore?\u2019 I asked. \n\u2018\
  Yes, some of my relatives live in Bangalore,\u2019 she replied.\n\u2018Oh really?\
  \ How come?\u2019\n\u2018Ah well, I\u2019m half Indian you, see. My Dad is from\
  \ Chennai and my Mum\u2019s Italian,\u2019 she said.\nI froze."
