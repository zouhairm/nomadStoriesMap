Text: "The last thing I expected to run into when flying to Florida in September 2017\
  \ was another hurricane. My travel goal was to explore Miami but my series of unfortunate\
  \ plans began with Hurricane Irma. I had literally been enjoying a tropical paradise\
  \ down in Key West for the labour long weekend when volunteer evacuations were ordered\
  \ for tourists. Luckily I was headed to Palm Beach County. However, as Irma brewed\
  \ closer panic struck, school was cancelled, Uber and Greyhound were suspended,\
  \ flights were being cancelled, people were evacuating, water and petrol supplies\
  \ were scarce, and while getting a flight out was rare and expensive it was possible.\
  \ However, travelling to an airport was a mission with everyone evacuating North.\
  \ So, I braced myself for an experience of a lifetime. A Category 5 hurricane in\
  \ a foreign country. A Cat 5 hurricane eye was going to pass right over me and I\
  \ had no clue what I was in for. \n\nThe shutters came out and all around Florida\
  \ homes were preparing for the battle of the wind and rain. But, first there was\
  \ a lot of waiting. And waiting. And waiting. I learnt to only trust hurricane tracking\
  \ maps posted by NOAA.\n\nAnd then the howling began, and the shutters shook ferociously,\
  \ and like that there was no electricity. All you could do was play games by candlelight,\
  \ sleep, eat, and watch the trees billowing in the wind. I had no idea of the damage\
  \ happening beyond the property I was staying at, absolutely no idea.\n\nA few days\
  \ later and the worst of it had passed. Luckily, the eye of Irma moved West and\
  \ so what I ended up experiencing was the outer bands and not a full on catastrophe.\n\
  \nA day later I went to the beach to celebrate my Australian birthday and saw fallen\
  \ palm fronts and trees and and the damage done to beautiful Florida. I had never\
  \ been subjected to curfew before and so many things even Maccas was closed? It\
  \ was like one of those movies were you feel so isolated. \n\nIrma was still travelling\
  \ North although weakened. You could tell she was still around just by how huge\
  \ and rough the waves were. And I'm from Australia. The amount of sand thrown around\
  \ and the different layout of the beaches made me realise how lucky I had been.\
  \ I had escaped a close encounter in Key West and had avoided being stranded in\
  \ Cuba which were my original travel plans for that week.\n\nBut, this was not the\
  \ end of my hurricane experience."
