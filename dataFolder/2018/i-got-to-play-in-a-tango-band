Text: "After getting out of the plane, settling on a room, I got out to get something\
  \ to eat. I am at Buenos Aires next to the airport, its afternoon and my expectations\
  \ are high, because of all I've heard about this place, the videos, magazines, even\
  \ my parents who spent two weeks over here and I will never forget the look on their\
  \ faces when they got home. \n\nIt's time to get around and have fun! Now it's me!\
  \ I play the clarinet and one of the things I want to get done here is to get to\
  \ join one of these street bands near \"Barrio Caminito\". When the sun goes down,\
  \ people gather around the \"plazas\", restaurants and bars. This is the time when\
  \ things happen, the music starts, couples start dancing, talking, making jokes,\
  \ and everything somehow is improvised. The smells are wonderful, there are grills\
  \ in every corner, and drinks like all the ones you know plus wines, juices and\
  \ all the mixes you can think of. \n\nIt's backpacking time in Buenos Aires! For\
  \ me, the way to travel is light and a low budget; it is the time to enjoy the simple\
  \ things plus the good nightlife. There are so many things to do, to see in this\
  \ town and it doesn't have to be expensive.\n\nThe Food: steaks everywhere, fresh\
  \ good and quality meats. The same thing goes for potatoes and salads. It is fresh,\
  \ made from scratch; if you order something to drink you will not see a hose pouring\
  \ out your favorite drink. Maybe you have never seen this on any bar you have been,\
  \ but \u201Cnow a day\u2019s\u201D everything comes from a can, not straight from\
  \ the fruit or vegetable. Just think about a \u201CMojito\u201D, a \u201CCaipirinha\u201D\
  \ or the \u201CPina Colada\u201D, Buenos Aires is fresh and made from scratch!\n\
  \nWhenever you want, it\u2019s easy to go cheap or jump to something more formal.\
  \ This place is so good it feels you are in Paris, around the Eiffel Tower, day\
  \ or night, sitting on the grass enjoying yourself where you can buy things to drink\
  \ or eat right where you are. Or go to a restaurant in the avenue des Champs-\xC9\
  lys\xE9es and enjoy fine dining. All is up to you.\n\nFinally I can\u2019t tell\
  \ you how good this experience is, I\u2019m just talking about a city trip in the\
  \ downtown area, and my favorite area in town is \u201CBarrio Caminito\u201D, a\
  \ mixture of French, Italian, Spanish cultures; A mixture of Catholic, Jewish traditions.\
  \ The music reflects its European roots plus Jazz. Like food, it is everywhere;\
  \ call it Mardigras, Manouche, it\u2019s good to play with my clarinet around the\
  \ barrio, find it on the street or in a theater, it is there to enjoy"
