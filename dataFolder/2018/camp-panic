Text: "I don\u2019t want to be dramatic, but if I don\u2019t get out of this tent,\
  \ I\u2019m going to die. It\u2019s 2 a.m. my first night camping in Iceland, and\
  \ I'm shivering.\n \nSix months ago, I told my husband I wanted to drive Iceland\u2019\
  s Ring Road\u20141,300 kilometers of lava fields, mountains, and fjords\u2014hiking\
  \ along the way. Contrasting vistas of volcanoes and glaciers, Icelandic landscapes\
  \ kept popping up in my Instagram feed. \n \nSoon we were in the basement of the\
  \ REI in SoHo trying on his-and-her hiking boots, summiting a faux boulder. We got\
  \ the boots, and then I lost my job. And then I stopped planning anything.\n \n\
  *\n\nI considered canceling Iceland. But an odd side effect of my layoff, a time\
  \ of great unknown, was a compulsion to introduce even more unknown into my life.\
  \ A compromise: We\u2019d go but camp\u2014which I had never done\u2014and save\
  \ some money. \u201CYou\u2019re going to camp?\u201D my best friend asked. My mom\
  \ laughed. Even the stranger at the Icelandic tent store doubted me. \u201CDidn\u2019\
  t you want to try camping somewhere warm first?\u201D he asked.\n\nBack in the tent,\
  \ freezing, I realize everyone\u2014even that stranger at the tent store\u2014was\
  \ right. I can\u2019t camp. Just like I won\u2019t be able to get a new job. My\
  \ thoughts spin out. Forget the physical challenges of this trip. Even tougher:\
  \ controlling my anxiety in an unfamiliar place.\n\n*\n \nNot that hiking in Iceland\
  \ isn\u2019t difficult. This island has 300,000 inhabitants, and they\u2019re all\
  \ in better shape than I am. A group of elderly people I left in the dust at the\
  \ beginning of our hike to the basalt waterfall Svartifoss catch up and pass me.\
  \ \n \nI make it up a steep dirt hill to a volcano called Hverfjall but not before\
  \ stopping five times to \u201Clook at the view\u201D (catch my breath). \n \nWe\
  \ drive to Seljalandsfoss waterfall, which\u2014if you\u2019re willing to get wet\u2014\
  you can walk behind. I scuttle over the trail of slippery rocks, barely stopping\
  \ to take in the scene, scared I\u2019m going to slip over the falls. I make it.\n\
  \ \nI climb 30 flights of stairs to the top of Sk\xF3gafoss waterfall, framed by\
  \ a double rainbow. I don\u2019t stop once. And now I\u2019m ready. I\u2019m going\
  \ to attempt the ultimate feat: Lie still and be alone with my thoughts until I\
  \ fall asleep in a tiny tent. I\u2019m going to try camping again.\n \n*\n  \nAt\
  \ 2 a.m., I wake up to people yelling about the Northern Lights. My husband unzips\
  \ the tent, and I look up at the emerald-green sky. It\u2019s like being in a lava\
  \ lamp, so groovy, a once-in-a-lifetime sight. \u201CDo you want to go outside and\
  \ watch?\u201D he asks. I can see. I\u2019m content."
