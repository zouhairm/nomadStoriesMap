Text: "It\u2019s not every day you put your life in the hands of a stranger. Especially\
  \ one you met over breakfast in the mountains of Greece. Sitting on the front bench\
  \ of an old VW with a quiet man named Vassili, he ponders if we will make it up\
  \ the steep road ahead and whether the sun will warm the pinnacles we aim to climb.\
  \ With the sun just rising and frost on the ground, I shiver in my winter jacket.\
  \ Climbing a shaded route would be miserable. Vassili is confident we\u2019ll be\
  \ in the sun and will make it up looming path. We take off just as I begin to feel\
  \ the nervousness and sweaty palms that accompanies a new climbing partner. This\
  \ wasn\u2019t just a new partner, this was a total stranger leading me up 400 vertical\
  \ feet.When the van halts, we continue to trek in on foot. Suddenly lost for words\
  \ myself, Vassili captivates me with tales of growing up and climbing the surrounding\
  \ pinnacles throughout his life. I ask if he\u2019s lived elsewhere; he left once.\
  \ He hated it. It took him over an hour to get to climbing. He returned home after\
  \ that. A playful smile crosses his face with his shoulders in a Greek shrug, \u201C\
  Why live elsewhere?\u201D The surrounding area is magical. Smooth towering rock\
  \ pinnacles fill my view. Many protected as UNESCO World Heritage Sites with active\
  \ monasteries from the 11th and 12th century sitting atop of them. Further in the\
  \ distance, snow-capped mountains reached up to the clouds. The space between, a\
  \ vast valley with a meandering river and small villages with blue capped churches\
  \ dotting the landscape. For several hours and 300 feet, Vassili continued to share\
  \ the vertical history of the monasteries. I realized he didn\u2019t share these\
  \ stories and details of his life to fill the space, but rather to calm my nerves\
  \ as he handled the ropes that would save my life in a fall. Later, we arrive at\
  \ the summit. I find a tiny metal box bolted to a rock, housing a log book. Grinning\
  \ at our success, we sign and date on the last line. Flipping to the front Vassili\
  \ shows me he was the third person to climb this route, 15 years ago. The truth\
  \ is, in climbing, the person leading the routes assumes more risk. He had trusted\
  \ me with his life and yet had still gone out of his way, to make sure this stranger\
  \ enjoyed his climb. That morning over breakfast Vassili could have just pointed\
  \ to a spot on a map and sent me on my way. But he didn\u2019t. He wanted me to\
  \ love this place. His passion was infectious and I\u2019m forever grateful that\
  \ I met Vassili, a kind local, from Meteora."
