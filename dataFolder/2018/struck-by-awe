Text: "I was lying on the black sand, the sun beating down staring out at the J\xF6\
  kuls\xE1rl\xF3n glacier lagoon. The sun was glimmering off the glaciers, it was\
  \ an unusually hot day and there was an air of magic around this small slice of\
  \ paradise. \nWhen I decided to come on this trip, it wasn't really for me, friends\
  \ were going and I sort of halfheartedly agreed. Yes, going to Iceland sounded wonderful,\
  \ but in my head, I was thinking about how much money I was spending, that I was\
  \ going to be falling behind at work, personal issues that were going to have to\
  \ be dealt with when I got back. I was 'there' but I wasn't 'really there.' \nBut,\
  \ sat staring out at this Antarctic looking landscape I was completely struck by\
  \ awe. It made everything that I had been worrying about seem insignificant, small,\
  \ silly. Looking at this complete wonder, I was baffled that I'd ever thought about\
  \ not coming on this trip. In that moment my mind did a complete 180-degree turn.\
  \ That was it. I was decided. From now on, I was going to go in search of all the\
  \ wondrous places on our planet that would make me keep having these moments of\
  \ awe. I wanted to experience as many of them as I could fit into my lifetime. That\
  \ was the moment I was bitten by the travel bug."
