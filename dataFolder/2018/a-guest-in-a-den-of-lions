Text: "There was no money. No way to get money, no exchange, nothing, in the entire\
  \ country. I didn\u2019t learn about Prime Minister Modi\u2019s declaration until\
  \ the morning after my arrival in New Delhi. My preconceived notion of a chaotic\
  \ India did not include the engorged lines outside of every bank and ransacked ATMs.\
  \ People of every class and caste elbowed their way toward the tellers to exchange\
  \ denounced rupees. The sudden repeal was meant to catch those stockpiling cash\
  \ without paying taxes unawares. Most Indians have no bank account, they carry cash,\
  \ and there was no money.\n\nOne man took my hand on the street, his left hand,\
  \ a wealthy hand by the glint of his watch, \u201CWe will never forgive Modi for\
  \ this!\u201D\n\nIt looked like there would be a riot outside the banks; I wanted\
  \ out of the city. \n\nA young man wearing a crisp orange turban, crude moustache\
  \ and beard, found me wide-eyed in the train station. \n\n\u201CYour country?\u201D\
  \n\n\u201CCanada,\u201D I lied, although I\u2019d lived there for years. \n\nHe\
  \ listed his cousins living across the Canadian hinterland. We bonded over the sweet\
  \ syrup of Gulab Jamun as we talked about money.\n\n\u201CI think it is good. The\
  \ country will stop terrorists, stop the black market,\u201D he said.\n\n\u201C\
  Yes, but there\u2019s no money.\u201D\n\n\u201CGo to Amritsar and stay at the Golden\
  \ temple. You will stay for free, eat for free. You don\u2019t need money. We are\
  \ Sikh.\u201D \n\n\"What is your name?\"\n\n\"Jaspal Singh. All Sikhs are named\
  \ Singh, it means lion.\"\n\nHe wrestled us to the front of the line. I handed the\
  \ more-than-ever precious rupees to the attendant as a dog ravaged a baby\u2019\
  s diaper in the corner. Men smoked beedis and drank chai, squatting placid while\
  \ a mother held her child over the tracks to release excrement. The train arrived,\
  \ it's main aisle clotted with bodies, spilling out the doors. \n\nDays later, as\
  \ I stirred a cauldron of chai the size of a Prius with a wooden oar, wafting ginger\
  \ and milk, I realized that it was the longest I had ever lived without using money.\
  \ I passed the oar off, walked through the dank kitchen by the women knuckle-deep\
  \ in chapati dough, past the thousands waiting to eat, down to the olive-green pool\
  \ surrounding the radiant temple.\n\nDespite the crisis, rupees flowed into the\
  \ donation box as steadily as the prayers from mouths. I waited in line with women\
  \ adorned by saris of every hue. In front stood two immense bearded guards wielding\
  \ longswords. They were silent and inscrutable. I unfolded the last remaining bills\
  \ from my pocket and slipped them into the box."
