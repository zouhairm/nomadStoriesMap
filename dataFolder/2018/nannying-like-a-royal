Text: "The last thing I expected when arriving into Au Pairing was a mansion as big\
  \ as Buckingham Palace. I am just a coastal girl from Sydney, grown up by the water,\
  \ as a barefoot child. Not too fussed about money, or status, or even knowing that\
  \ nannys really existed other than the movies. I had taken the job a week before\
  \ as an impulsive reaction to the voice inside of me, that for so long was telling\
  \ me to escape. I was on the plane a week later, with a one-way ticket, with my\
  \ bags packed to the brim with previously un-owned winter gear, ready for London.\
  \ After my last surf on the Australian shores, I boarded the plane with wet hair,\
  \ taking traces of the salt water with me. \nThe only expectation I gave myself\
  \ was that I would be nannying for a lovely family, who appeared humble and joyful\
  \ on Skype. The rest was up to fate, and in the meantime on the plane\u2026 up to\
  \ my imagination. I had nightmares that I would arrive into child care hell, living\
  \ in a tiny bedroom and entering into a world I would still need an escape from.\
  \ I ignored these thoughts by telling myself to trust my gut instinct, I liked them\
  \ on Skype, they will be lovely, Or was I just desperate and took any job available?\n\
  \nI hopped off the plane in Heathrow Airport to be greeted by a guy holding a sign\
  \ saying my name, he was my private escort to my new house. The air was cold and\
  \ crisp, I could see my breath as if I had instantly transformed into a dragon upon\
  \ arrival into London. I stared out of the window in awe along the roads all decorated\
  \ with duplex brick homes and little cars. I was preparing myself at any moment\
  \ to turn into one of the driveways, to say my first hello, praying that they would\
  \ like me, as I have just flown to the other side of the world to nanny for them\u2026\
  \ I was anxious every street we turned down. \nThen we turned into a long drive\
  \ way and winded down through big trees and bushes, I could see a glimpse of yellow\
  \ brick at the end of the driveway. As we kept driving the house revealed more and\
  \ more yellow brick until I reached the end of the driveway, into a cul-de-sac of\
  \ 5 prestigious cars, and the driver said \u2018We have arrived Ma\u2019am\u2019\
  . Just as 3 of the cutest little British blonde haired boys ran out smiling to hug\
  \ and greet me, helping me with my suitcases, and the parents smiled with joy as\
  \ they welcomed me into their home for a traditional English cup of tea.\n\nOh my\
  \ god. This was truly the last thing I expected when becoming a nanny, but every\
  \ thing I had ever hoped for."
