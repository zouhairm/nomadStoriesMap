Text: "Sometimes just one meeting with a local changes your perception about a place.For\
  \ me Switzerland was all about alps,mystic meadows,cowbells and Swiss chocolates\
  \ until I met Shanti, a local who showed me different story of the country.\nI met\
  \ her outside a train station in Aarau where after talking for an hour felt a special\
  \ connection with her soul. She offered me to explore a day in her life.At her place\
  \ I saw her spiritual connection with my country India. A girl born and brought\
  \ up in Switzerland but her name is Shanti because she embraced indian religion\
  \ after her first trip to india. \nI learned how to make fondue and in exchange\
  \ she asked me recipe of Gol-gappas.We both share love for yoga and are vegan so\
  \ had no idea how the day passed while exchanging ideas.Her story as a single mother\
  \ and struggle with a teenager made me emotional and reminded me that a women's\
  \ life is tuff no matter which part of the world you are living.I was amazed so\
  \ much how she keep herself busy all day long.From working in a bank to yoga instructor\
  \ and having a foot massage parlor this swiss woman is diligent. \n Fortunately\
  \ it was a Saturday so she took me to a market nearby named Aarauer Wochenmarkt.Lovely\
  \ little market in Aarau every Saturday morning. You can buy fresh seasonak vegetables\
  \ amd fruits from local farmers but also other products like jam, meat, olives,\
  \ bread and other stuff. High quality for low prices. If you visit Aarau on weekends\
  \ you should take a walk through the market. Although she wasn't very fluent in\
  \ English but it didn't stop us in connecting.\nI told her about my plans of staying\
  \ in the country for 10 day she suggested to learn few local phrases like Danke\
  \ for thank you(in German),Merci in French, Grazie in Italian,few more words in\
  \ 3 different languages she said to note down. I realised how within one country\
  \ language differ due to different region. Her welcoming and hospitable nature and\
  \ valuable suggestions helped me having a memorable time in Switzerland.\nWhile\
  \ saying goodbye to her in the evening I felt like bidding adieu to a close friend.I\
  \ offered her to make a visit to my city in india so that I can show her my place\
  \ in best possible way. Looking forward to soon welcome my new friend from winter\
  \ wonderland,a land of great hospitality and smiling faces......i. e. SWITZERLAND"
