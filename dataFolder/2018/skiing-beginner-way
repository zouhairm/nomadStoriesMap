Text: "What did I get myself into?\n\nBefore me, rows of Japanese school kids wearing\
  \ identical ski suits facing their instructors with excitement. There is an undeniable\
  \ shock among rookie instructors of the orderliness before us. I am about to teach\
  \ basic skiing to a group of twenty Japanese kids over the next three days without\
  \ knowing Japanese. What better way to make a local connection?\n\n\u201CHai!\u201D\
  \ comes the final shout from the kids. An acknowledgement of the ending of ceremony.\
  \ Everyone takes a bow. \u201CAre you ready?!\u201D comes another shout from a Japanese\
  \ lead instructor. \u201CYeah!\u201D Thunders from hundreds of kids ready to ski.\
  \ The stoke is real!\n\nOk, so it\u2019s not all bad. I have a dozen or so phrases\
  \ written in a plastic cover attached to my jacket sleeve. Knowing that my colleagues\
  \ are also jumping into the deep end, is comforting.\n\nSurprisingly, the key Japanese\
  \ words combined with my kick ass demos lead my never-evers to rocking out some\
  \ basics. I\u2019m starting to think the Japanese words on my sleeve have magic\
  \ powers. There are collision and skis flying off, but the camaraderie of the kids\
  \ is touching. We practice a lot. Not everyone gets it, but everyone seems to be\
  \ having fun! \n\nThe Good Will Tour to Hachi Kogen is a volunteer ski teaching\
  \ trip for international instructors with a sense of curiosity and adventure. It\u2019\
  s an experience and an opportunity to contribute. Turns out, some kids are visiting\
  \ snow for the first time, not just skiing for the first time! Spending three days\
  \ in the mountains with classmates, learning, playing and facing new challenges.\
  \ These are memories they will hold on to for a lifetime.  \n\nBeginner Way is the\
  \ first official ski run we attempt as a group. Most students can 'hanogi' (make\
  \ A shape with theirs skis to slow down). Starting off with a perfect line up and\
  \ all 20 students ready. The class is about to encounter the important lesson of\
  \ changing direction \u2018magaru\u2019 (turn). Total carnage comes around the bend\
  \ on Beginner Way. Skis, poles, kids momentarily tangled together, but miraculously\
  \ they get themselves back on track. The tail gunner instructor helps the Bambi\
  \ skiers, picking them up as they fumble and fall. \n\nWe make the final turn and\
  \ Beginner Way ends. The students take their skis off, line up with huge smiles.\
  \ The struggles and crashes are momentarily forgotten. It begins to snow and the\
  \ kids take a few moments to just play and cheer. They are ready for round two and\
  \ their first ride on the lift. \u2018Ikimasho!\u2019 (Let's go!)"
