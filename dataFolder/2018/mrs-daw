Text: "A day of trudging miles among steep hills, drizzle-soaked ruins and sleepy\
  \ ancient villages had left me desperate for a pint and a nice sit-down. \n\n \u201C\
  Day 2 Address: Mrs Daw, Shawbarns, Butterflower Lane, Callowburn, Northumberland\u201D\
  , read my itinerary, crumpled and smudged with rainwater. I looked up at the sequestered\
  \ farmhouse before me, a pile of grey stone enveloped by green and rainy hills.\
  \ This must be it. I brought the metal door knocker down against the wood with a\
  \ smile upon my face. \n\nThe door opened on to Mrs Daw herself: five feet nothing\
  \ of a sprightly, apron-wearing middle-aged farmer\u2019s wife who had a shock of\
  \ wavy blonde hair, sleeves rolled to her elbows and forearms displayed like a warrior\
  \ wielding her weapons. Her face was ruddy from the exertion of keeping a tight\
  \ ship afloat and bright with a natural cheer I hadn\u2019t encountered before.\
  \ \n\n\u201CAhhh yer muuuust be Mr Farmiloooor,\u201D she cried, in the strongest\
  \ of Northumbrian accents (a blend of Geordie with the thickest speech of the Scottish\
  \ Highlands). \u201CCuuuum in! Cuuuum in!\u201D \n\nI stepped out of the August\
  \ drizzle and into the soft warmth of Mrs Daw\u2019s home.  \u201CSet yerself doooowan\
  \ in there luuve and drink yer tea,\u201D she said. \u201CAh wooooann\u2019t be\
  \ tew ticks.\u201D As she disappeared, I removed my boots and came into a sitting\
  \ room that belonged to the 1950s. A fire quietly crackling in a black hearth filled\
  \ the room with a homely warmth and on a coffee table near the mantelpiece a tea\
  \ cup made of delicate blue porcelain stood beside two perfectly buttered slices\
  \ of malt loaf. As I perched on the edge of the sofa, sipped from the vessel and\
  \ chewed the sweet and juicy delicacies, a gust of wind roared down from the hills\
  \ and splattered rain against the window. I smiled: total bliss. \n\nMoments later,\
  \ Mrs Daw returned and showed me to my room, a comfortable chamber on the first\
  \ floor. \n\n\u201CSooa yer bed\u2019s theeere and the toilet\u2019s deown the hall,\
  \ orrkaaay?\u201D she said. \n\n\u201CThanks very much!\u201D I said. I threw up\
  \ my bag and dumped it on the bed. But Mrs Daw\u2019s eyes darted to the big damp\
  \ mass violating the bed clothes and she drew in her breath and widened her eyes.\
  \ \n\n\u201COh noooooah, muuuuther wuuuuuldn\u2019t want that,\u201D she said. \n\
  \n I felt my stomach stir. I had transgressed and I was deeply sorry. Sheepishly,\
  \ I shifted the bag on to a wooden stand at the end of the bed, scattering some\
  \ rain drops on to the carpet in the process.\n\n\u201CAll reet then,\u201D said\
  \ Mrs Daw, and disappeared again."
