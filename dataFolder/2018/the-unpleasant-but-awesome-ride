Text: 'So it was a sunny morning when we reached the island we had planned to go .

  It was one of the most beautiful things I had ever seen till then , after we reached
  we played on the beach for quite some time later only did we realize that we had
  missed out lunch after that we rushed to grab our plates that when my sister spoted
  a jet ski far further away form where we where she holding  my hand pulled me all
  across , after we reached she said she wanted to ride so she insisted me to ride
  with her but I said no . She asked my aunt to ride with her who was also her mother
  I had forgot to mention that she was  my cousin , that''s when I realized that my
  aunt doesn''t know to swim and she couldn''t help herself and her daughter at the
  time a an accident or some other kinds of emergency so I gather my nuts and was
  Ready to set for the sail that''s when I thought why not ask the instructor for
  some help , I did instruct him to send a speed boat if we had some emergency he
  Did  agree then I sat behind her that when I asked  my sister a question which I
  would regret asking her at that moment "do u know to swim" she very calmly reply
  No , I panicked and didn''t know what to do as both of Ur didn''t know to swim so
  I said let''s see what happens I know my Luck . The starting 2 rounds was good but
  the next round were little far I also did say the guy riding to go slow but don''t
  actually know why he didn''t reduce the speed finally we reached a pinning where
  I actually we are done that''s why reality stuck my we were already falling and
  doom that the next thing I heard my eye where open I could see Dark water flowing
  from both the sides covering my view slowly as I feel for the ocean was not kind
  it too showered and belte me as thought I was a bottle throw into the waters I the
  started coming back up slowly then I reached the top I could only see. Water everywhere
  I tried to screem for her I couldn''t find anyone suddenly I see a hand on my shoulder
  holding me guess what it was my sister the life jacket has saved us from drowning
  but who would take us to my mother land to the place I was born I almost did loos
  all of my strength and started to wonder if this was my last that''s when I felt
  something under my leg it was fast but effective this happened for sometime I thought
  it was a shark but to my surprise they were dolphins they have me that courage to
  survive we started screening as loud as possible the waves never stopped pounding
  us up and down but we hold our hands till a view of hope'
