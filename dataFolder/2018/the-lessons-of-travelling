Text: "The last thing I expected is that travelling really makes you get to know your\
  \ own self so much better. Not only yourself, but it also showed me that the world\
  \ can teach you a lot about people, about relationships, about your family, about\
  \ what is truly important and what is not. You can just learn so many lessons through\
  \ travelling. I grew up with the desire to travel. My parents have always tried\
  \ to tell me that we are not supposed to stay at one place for our whole lives.\
  \ Especially if you are lucky enough to have the opportunities to travel, to see\
  \ places, to meet different people and to broaden your mind.\nAll the stories I\
  \ grew up with, about all of their adventures, made my desire to travel and to experience\
  \ my own adventures increase more and more.\nSo I decided to be brave, I decided\
  \ to leave my family for the very first time for longer than a couple of weeks.\
  \ \nTo be honest it is not only one thing that I didn't expect. One of the last\
  \ things I expected is the fact that I'm so glad about the friend who decided to\
  \ come with me. I am more than happy about her, about someone who's always there\
  \ for me, somebody I can talk to and tell my feelings, my anxieties and especially\
  \ to have a person who laughes about the stupidest things with me.\nAnother last\
  \ thing I would never have expected is that on the one hand I'm already so excited\
  \ to fly back home to hug my family and tell them about everything I learned and\
  \ experienced, but on the other hand I feel like I don't ever want to stop travelling\
  \ and go back home. What I also didn't expect is that you have to be yourself even\
  \ though you are in another country. At the beginning of our journey we tried to\
  \ fit into the role of being travellers, but after a short time we realized that\
  \ this is going to be our life for the next few months, so what we should do is\
  \ doing the things we like. It is not necessary only because we are 'Backpackers'\
  \ now to hike on the top of mountains or to do bungee jumping. We shall stay ourselves\
  \ and that's what we try to do most of the time. When we don't feel like doing anything,\
  \ we don't.  Sometimes we just relax, listen to music, read or whatever, but if\
  \ we really want to do something or see a place, we figure out to do so. I learned\
  \ that I don't have to try to fit into any role. The best I can be is myself and\
  \ if people don't like me that way they are not worth spending any thoughts about.\
  \ It's more important to be accepted the way you truly are and especially to accepted\
  \ yourself."
