Text: "Existing somewhere between a resident and a visitor. This has been my encounter\
  \ since I moved to Milan, Italy.\n\nThere I was all packed with my suitcase... actually,\
  \ suitcases... and off I was. Fear and anxiety were common words in my vocabulary,\
  \ although I was silent about it. Silent about the fact that I was scared out of\
  \ my wits about moving away from my comfort zone! Who would admit to that... excitement,\
  \ joy, delight, elation, beaming glows those were common words that people were\
  \ familiar with, not fear. I mean it's Italy! Heck!  My closest friends thought\
  \ this was a cause for celebration of course, and so we drank together and toasted\
  \ to bold decisions. And I was thinking about how, in general, most people don\u2019\
  t celebrate endings often enough. We celebrate beginnings. We toast to the moment\
  \ a person enters into a commitment with something or someone they might end up\
  \ hating soon after the party has gone home, but will never confess to because the\
  \ presents were so nice and quitting tastes like bitter failure. We celebrate the\
  \ elderly couple walking side by side in the park, giving little thought to whether\
  \ or not they\u2019re a good couple or if they\u2019re just committing out of existential\
  \ panic and a mutual lack of backbone. We don\u2019t know. We just celebrate. \n\
  \nPerhaps we are missing another kind of opportunity to celebrate. Endings. When\
  \ we walk away from relationships that are bad for us, when we quit jobs that are\
  \ no good for our souls, when we have the courage to be single or unemployed while\
  \ whirling in uncertainty until we know what is next. We don\u2019t tend to celebrate\
  \ that. A lot of people pity it, actually, but isn\u2019t it so easy to wind up\
  \ tolerating 20 years in a shitty job or a shitty relationship, enduring like a\
  \ champion? Isn\u2019t it so easy to just accept, suck up, head down, thumbs up,\
  \ man/woman up? It must be easy, because I see so many pushing on, staring out of\
  \ eyeballs lodged in sockets the colour of a dead fish.\n\nMy move was not a vacation.\
  \ I was ending years of bad career decisions, ending years of discounting on what\
  \ I truly wanted to do. Despite the international travel, relocating from Windhoek\
  \ to Milan wasn't the same as passing through. I had to think long-term. \u201C\
  Starting a new life in Milan\u201D sounded fresh, exhilarating, transformational,\
  \ like a birth. It was also difficult and sometimes messy; also like a birth, I\
  \ suppose."
