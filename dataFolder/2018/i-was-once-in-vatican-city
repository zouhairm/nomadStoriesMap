Text: "On an overcast September morning, I went on a walking tour through the Vatican\
  \ museums. Outside formidable gates that read \u201CMVSEI VATICANI\u201D we assembled.\
  \ A motley crew of 30 tourists of various shapes, sizes and motivations. Our delightfully\
  \ Italian guide is Igor. He\u2019s charming and energetic with sparkling green eyes.\
  \ Every walking-tour guide has a special flag to shepherd tourists about and a matching\
  \ special story. For Igor, its a worn scarf that his littlest daughter gave him\
  \ with a hope that \u201CDaddy\u2019s group will never lose sight of him\u201D Could\
  \ it be any easier to fall in love? \n\u201COh ladies and gentleman! the geeeeenius\
  \ of Michelangelo!\u201D. This guy is such a professional. Its clear that the Sistine\
  \ is the belle of the Vatican ball since its shrouded in legend and strict rules.\
  \ Igor tells us how the impetuous Michelangelo initially refused to paint the chapel,\
  \ since his heart lay in stone and chisel. How he was forced by the sitting pope\
  \ and as an act of rebellion, he used the most expensive blue paints! The instructions\
  \ to the chapel are simple. 10 minutes inside. No talking. No Photos. What a build-up!\
  \ I feel my own excitement start to hit the ceiling.\n\nAfter an hour of meandering\
  \ through the museums and gawking at paintings, we approach the chapel. As if on\
  \ a school field trip, we are assembled into a single file. Loud chatter is reduced\
  \ to hushed whispers. There is a sense of ceremony to this place and a sharp coolness\
  \ in the air. Igor will wait for us on the other side of the chapel and the 10 minutes.\
  \ \nAt last, we meet chapel. Amidst a 100 others, I look at the most famous ceiling\
  \ in the world. Every little brush stroke, colour choice and detail. The drama,\
  \ the creation of Adam and the astonishing blues. \n\nHere, I finally start to feel\
  \ where I am. I start to feel a sense of this place. A sense of history itself.\n\
  And just as I am being swept up in this moment, suddenly a voice! \n\nA voice from\
  \ up above! From the heavens itself? \nAs I look around, I\u2019m baffled! Where\
  \ is this sound coming from? Who could it be? God? \nAnd the voice instructs in\
  \ a grave breathy baritone. \n\n\u201CSHHHHHHHHHHHHH NOOOOOO PHOTO!\u201D every\
  \ five minutes. \u201CSHHHHHHHHHHHHH NOOOOOO PHOTO!\u201D\n\nI can\u2019t help but\
  \ giggle. Even here, in the presence of a masterpiece, one could use a reminder.\
  \ A reminder to stay in the moment and out of Instagram. The flash isn't great for\
  \ the expensive paint either. \nThe Sistine Chapel, officially the last known place\
  \ on earth where you can't take a selfie. Thank God!"
