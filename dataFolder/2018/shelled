Text: "The smell of dead ocean welled in my nostrils. The normally blue water of the\
  \ bay looked steel under the misty sky. My wife hung back under the eaves of the\
  \ colorful church that gave Santo Antonio de Lisboa its name. She crossed her arms\
  \ and frowned, but I knew what I had to do. I pressed on down to the beach, the\
  \ stench growing stronger. The men were huddle around an makeshift table of empty\
  \ crates and plywood that was littered with shells. The rain had no effect on the\
  \ men as they silently ate oysters and drank beer from the liter-sized bottles common\
  \ in Brazil. \u201CBom dia,\u201D I said. They all turned to stare at me with looks\
  \ of bemusement and annoyance. One man grumbled that the tourists go to the beaches\
  \ in Ingles and that I was lost. I just shrugged and pointed to the nets hanging\
  \ out in the bay, resting just below the waterline. Tell me about your oysters,\
  \ I managed. The faces changed a little at my accent. If you want oysters, one man\
  \ said, go to the restaurants. He pointed in the direction of the upscale eateries\
  \ that lined the bay. I shook my head and pulled out a wad of reis from my pocket.\
  \ You grow the oysters, yes? So I want to pay you. Smiles started to crack free.\
  \ They talked to each in such heavy accents that I couldn\u2019t follow, but laugher\
  \ ensued and I was invited to take a seat on an overturned crate. I accepted and\
  \ was handed a cup of beer and a live oyster that I just stared at. This caused\
  \ more laughter. The man to my right took back the oyster and used a screwdriver\
  \ to pop the top shell off revealing a fat, shimmering orb. A small pool of seawater\
  \ brimmed to the shell's edge. The man returned the oyster to me and I tipped the\
  \ shell into my mouth, slurping a little and closing my eyes. Then, for a second,\
  \ there was silence as I bit into the belly. A rush of sweetness overcame the initial\
  \ hit of salt and sea. When I opened my eyes, all of the faces were staring at me\
  \ again but this time they were beaming. It\u2019s good, right? I nodded as if in\
  \ a stupor. So good. The man who had opened my oyster pointed back towards the church\
  \ at my wife. I looked up at her, her arms still crossed, and remembered that we\
  \ were supposed to be sightseeing. I then looked around me at the beautiful mess\
  \ of oyster farmers on their lunch break. This was the sight to see. I stood, laying\
  \ the reis on the table, thanking the farmers. The man with the screwdriver popped\
  \ open two more oysters and handed them to me. For you wife, he said, tell her welcome\
  \ to Florianopolis."
