Text: "Swimming across a river sounds exciting. How about walking on one? Magical\
  \ as it sounds it feels likewise, as you walk on the blanket of ice over the roaring\
  \ river Zanskar in Ladakh during winter. This 70kms long Chadar Trek places you\
  \ at the mercy of the river as it unfreezes, transforms & refreezes. It tests your\
  \ limits, pushing you to climb steep jagged cliffs, take painfully long detours\
  \ & fall head over heels - not in love, but on solid slippery ice in subzero temperatures\
  \ as low as -30\xB0C. Sculpted frozen waterfalls dispersing a burst of colours like\
  \ a prism, shadow play on rugged mountains wearing a new look moments apart, this\
  \ is a journey that not only promises surreal vistas on the outside but also helps\
  \ one experience the beauty and strength within. Unaware of what lay ahead I embarked\
  \ on this journey, not realizing when the brilliance of nature overshadowed the\
  \ gradual build up of AMS symptoms, leading me on a date with \u201CMr. Fear of\
  \ Death\" welcoming me with open arms taking me through dangerously low oxygen levels\
  \ to hallucinations. As the sun bid adieu giving way to a frigid overcast pitch\
  \ black night, I reluctantly fell asleep fearing the worst to happen, to wake up\
  \ breathless in the middle of the night. An eerie sinking feeling sent shivers down\
  \ my spine & moments felt like ages, only to make me realize,\"If it is to be, it's\
  \ upto me\". With strong winds blowing outside I focused on calming the storm within\
  \ me as I repeated to myself, \u201CGirl, you're going back home for sure\", & as\
  \ the Sun rose, my menacing \"Date\" stepped back. Back on the gruelling return\
  \ course, fighting to keep my \u201CStalker Date\u201D at bay, I finally reached\
  \ a point minutes away from the base camp yet unreachable, as the \"Chadar\" cracked.\
  \ The whirling waters ahead meant a serious detour, leading to a whirl of emotions\
  \ & a heart thumping wildly as I climbed up a craggy cliff. My oxygen starved muscles\
  \ added to the intense pain as I walked through deep snow & crossed knee deep waters\
  \ of the icy cold river. But the vision of the tiny gleaming lanterns at the base\
  \ camp made the anguish feel trivial as I finally reached them with feet frozen\
  \ blue but a heart warm with joy. Today as I reflect on this spectacular journey\
  \ that took my breath away - literally and metaphorically, I realize, each of us\
  \ at some time go through our own unique \u201CChadar Treks\u201D. And as we stand\
  \ strong through the pain, we just need to remind ourselves -\"The pain you feel\
  \ today, is the strength you feel tomorrow\"."
