Text: "I didn\u2019t go far to find another world.\n\nAnnie came outside of her hogan\
  \ when I pulled up. She was tiny, her walnut-shell face cracked with a smile. \n\
  \n\u201CHallo!\u201D, she yelled.\n\nShe wore a couple layers of trousers, old ski\
  \ jacket, and a bright pink knit hat. I could see how she earned her nickname \u201C\
  Annie Oakley\u201D. Although somewhere between 80 and as old as the earth, Annie\
  \ Begay lived by herself on a remote mesa surrounded on three sides by jagged canyons.\
  \ She was good with a rifle, grew corn and squash, let her sheep roam to feed on\
  \ meager desert plants.\n\nI came as a volunteer for the Black Mesa Caravan to live\
  \ with a Navajo elder over Thanksgiving week, to help with the animals and home\
  \ repair. Other volunteers were delivering firewood, groceries, dog food. Annie\
  \ glared at the small load of wood in my truck.\n\n\u201CWhen is the man coming?\u201D\
  \ she demanded. Soon, I told her.\n\nThe hogan was dark except for the late sunlight\
  \ through two tiny windows. Inside, two cots, small table, stove in the center for\
  \ cooking and heat. It was cold.\n\nAnnie pointed at a cot. \n\n\u201CHere.\u201D\
  \ Basic English, no modifiers. When her hearing aids weren\u2019t on, she yelled.\n\
  \nI shared the rhythm of her day. Up at dawn, sleep at dark. The hogan had no electricity\
  \ or running water. My ideal of this simple life crumbled at its poverty, but I\
  \ wondered, what did Annie see?\n\nIn the morning we brought water to the animals\
  \ from a rusted cistern. I lifted a heavy bucket and clumsily started for the corrals,\
  \ slopping water. Annie grabbed my bucket and hers. The sheep and goats made a ruckus,\
  \ but the skinny working dogs still hid in their piles of dirty wool. \n\nAnnie\
  \ pointed to an empty pen. She drew a stick horse in the sand, wiped it out with\
  \ her foot. \n\n\u201CThat one, no more,\u201D she said sadly. \n\nAs we walked\
  \ back to the hogan, a ragged black and white puppy ran towards us. Annie picked\
  \ up rocks and threw them, yelling and chasing it away. I knew the hardship of another\
  \ mouth to feed.\n\nMy car broke down on an errand, and I wasn\u2019t able to finish\
  \ my week with Annie. A few months later I drove the lonely dirt road to visit her.\
  \ There was no way to let her know I was coming. She was on her porch, leaning over\
  \ a box. I called, but Annie didn\u2019t look up. I put my hand on her shoulder.\
  \ Annie wasn\u2019t startled. She pointed: inside the box, mewling kittens.\n\n\u201C\
  Mother no good.\u201D Annie shook her head. A yip from the bushes, and a black and\
  \ white puppy ran out.\n\nI waited. \n\n\u201CLucky,\u201D Annie called. He ran\
  \ towards her."
