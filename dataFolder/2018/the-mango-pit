Text: "It was my first day in Santa Marta. I woke up in my jungle abode before sunrise\
  \ completely covered by my sheets, trying to win a battle against the Colombian\
  \ mosquitos.  \n\nI went outside to start my movement meditation, a dance devoted\
  \ to Rhiannon, the goddess of freedom. Accompanied by the trembling leaves, the\
  \ warm breeze and the smell of the fruit trees, I couldn\u2019t think of a better\
  \ place to feel like a goddess. \n\nAfter dancing for a while, I noticed an old\
  \ man working on one of the surrounding trees. I immediately faked a yawn in an\
  \ effort to conceal my dance moves.\n\n\u201CBuenos d\xEDas,\u201D I said. \n\n\
  He stopped for a moment; dried his sweat; and completely ignored me.\n\nHe didn\u2019\
  t seem to be bothered by my dance, or me, but I felt foolish and couldn\u2019t stop\
  \ talking. In a place that oozed peace and tranquility, I found myself complaining\
  \ about the hot weather, evening storms and mosquito bites just to fill the awkward\
  \ silence. The man had turned his back to me; sipping his yerba mate, while bathing\
  \ his face in the sun.\n\nThe next morning I woke up even earlier, hoping to be\
  \ alone for my jungle infused meditation. I went outside and spotted him removing\
  \ weeds around a gorgeous mango tree. \n \n\u201CDon\u2019t bother talking to him.\u201D\
  \ Said a younger man passing by. \u201CHe is Felipe, the tree whisperer.\u201D I\
  \ just smiled at him and went back inside.\n\nThe next and last day, I found a fragrant,\
  \ ripe mango outside my door. I looked out and saw Felipe seated on the tree\u2019\
  s roots while enjoying one himself. For the first time I copied him and kept my\
  \ mouth shut. Moments later he waved his hand and invited me to sit next to him.\
  \ As I sat, he took my mango into his hands and peeled it. I let the morning sun\
  \ tickle my cheeks and forgave the gray cloud that was headed our way. The mango\
  \ was delicious and I cherished his quiet company. \n\nFelipe cleaned the mango\
  \ pit and returned it to me. In a spin to get myself out of the jungle and into\
  \ the airport, my taxi arrived and I got into the car before asking what I should\
  \ do with the pit.\n\nBack in Spain, I visited an ancient yew tree that I always\
  \ felt a strong connection to, had a sweet moment of silence, and buried the pit\
  \ next to it. \n\nI came back to the tree a few weeks later and a four-leaf clover\
  \ had bloomed. Gazing at the miracle clover, I remembered Henry Miller said once:\
  \ \u201CEvery man, when he gets quiet, when he becomes desperately honest with himself,\
  \ is capable of uttering profound truths.\u201D The truth was, I missed my friend\
  \ Felipe."
