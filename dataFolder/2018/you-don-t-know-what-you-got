Text: "The streets, like a scene out of Grease the musical, were decorated with classic\
  \ American cars. Transported to the 1950s as I stepped out of the airport, I was\
  \ gazed upon like the traveler from the future that I was. The local people of the\
  \ city were lively and vibrant: a stark contrast to their beautifully unique infrastructure\
  \ crumbling like forgotten ruins.\n\nThe four months before I arrived in Havana,\
  \ Cuba were particularly difficult for me. My spirit broken from the stresses of\
  \ living in the unrelenting concrete jungle of New York City. Happiness and satisfaction\
  \ were distant strangers to me. I began to complain about my misfortunes as casually\
  \ as speaking about the weather. I needed to get away and Cuba would be my temporary\
  \ refuge.\n\nYou hear about Cuba being a third world country, but seeing it is what\
  \ gives you real perspective. There were grocery stores with empty shelves, frequent\
  \ water outages, and Cubans were almost completely cut off from the outside world.\
  \ Things that those of us in the developed world take for granted were considered\
  \ luxuries in Cuba. And although there was much for Cubans to complain about, they\
  \ chose not to.\n\n\u201CEvery day above ground is a good day,\u201D said my Cuban\
  \ host as we walked along the white, sandy beach. And that is the general attitude\
  \ of the Cuban people. You see it in their sincere smiles as they pass you on the\
  \ street, you hear it in their upbeat music, you feel it in the rhythm of their\
  \ sultry dancing as they take your hand and lead you across a roofless dance floor\
  \ in the hot Havana night. Cubans may not have much, but they are a happy people\
  \ who create their own nirvana in an unlikely place.\n\n\u201CWe do not have a lot,\
  \ but we Cubans are happy because we appreciate everything little thing we do have.\
  \ It is hard for those who have everything to appreciate what they have,\u201D a\
  \ female Cuban vendor explained to me while I was out picking fresh fruit in an\
  \ open market. It felt as though she knew exactly what I was going through. Her\
  \ words embraced and comforted my spirit like a loving mother would a crying child.\
  \ It was then that I was reminded of how fortunate I was to be living in the greatest\
  \ city on earth.\n\nAs I hopped back into the time machine back to New York, I was\
  \ eager to return to the city I so loathed before my visit to Cuba. The same stresses\
  \ that chased me off before were now only minor annoyances hardly worth flinching\
  \ about. I am forever grateful to Cuba for reminding me that I have much to be happy\
  \ about."
