Text: "Ever since i was a kid growing up in a small town in Canada I dreamed of traveling\
  \ the world.  It was not enough to read a book or watch TV.  My curiosity was unending\
  \ and I knew I had to experience it for myself.  The years seemed to pass away while\
  \ the purpose of my existence lingered in the back of my mind.  I remembered my\
  \ mom saying \u201Cenjoy life while you are young\u201D.  Did she have regrets?\
  \  Would I have regrets?  I made a decision to change my destiny.  I choose to travel\
  \ to Australia on a working holiday visa.  My imagination was running wild as I\
  \ researched the land DownUnder.  More than ever I was excited and ready to live\
  \ the dream.\n   A blast of summer heat welcomed me at the Sydney airport.  I set\
  \ myself up in a hostel where I met wonderful travelers and locals alike.  I tried\
  \ burgers with beetroot and Vegemite on toast but i personally liked grilled Kangaroo\
  \ steak.  I found some odd jobs but the excitement of being abroad started to fade\
  \ with the grind of working nine to five.\n   I headed off to the hippie village\
  \ of Byron Bay to learn how to surf.  I spent most of the day struggling to catch\
  \ a wave when a more experienced surfer said \u201Cmove out of the way\u201D.  \
  \ Anticipating the next wave approaching I noticed a grey fin cut through the water\
  \ triggering a dose of adrenaline inside me.  \nMy fear soon turned into a magical\
  \ moment as I realized it was just a dolphin budding in front of me. Frick, even\
  \ the dolphin thinks I am in the way.  She glided along the rolling wave with ease\
  \ and upstaged us all.  \n   My journey continued with a weekend camping excursion\
  \ on Fraser Island.  I crammed into a 4x4 Land Rover with food, supplies and five\
  \ other backpackers.  Together we explored the majestic island of fresh water lakes.\
  \ sand dunes and wild dingos. Next stop was a scuba diving course in the town of\
  \ Airlie Beach, a gateway to the Great Barrier Reef.   The challenge of submerging\
  \ your head under water and breathing normally took a while to get used to.  As\
  \ soon as I let my mind go a new world unfolded around me with colorful corals and\
  \ tropical fish that would dance and sway to an imaginary symphony.\n   Returning\
  \ home I was not the same person.  Forever changed and forever grateful.  I now\
  \ had the power to alter my life.  Interacting with other cultures made me feel\
  \ part of a global family.  The memories I gained have become precious reminders\
  \ of time well spent.  It would not be long before I looked at a world map and contemplated\
  \ my next adventure."
