Text: "The scariest day of my life was starting the Inca Trail. Many things I did\
  \ not expect on this journey, the first one was the moment we stepped off the bus\
  \ and saw our 14 porters with bags half their size. I wasn't fully physically ready,\
  \ the track all of a sudden got extremely steep, I was pushing myself to keep up,\
  \ it got awfully hard to breathe. This was my first sight into how really tough\
  \ this was going to be. I couldn't have asked for a better tour leader, he was with\
  \ me the whole day, teaching me how to breathe and not letting the concern of falling\
  \ behind stress me, which stayed with me. Once we got to our first lunch destination\
  \ it absolutely blew us away, tents set up with table and chairs inside, a portable\
  \ toilet and a kitchen with cooks in uniform. Then out came 3 courses all which\
  \ was cooked on a gas-stove top in a tent. Once we got to our campsite, everything\
  \ was set up including a bowl of warm water at our tent to help clean us up. The\
  \ second day was by far the hardest of all, we got woken up by the porter bringing\
  \ us coca leaf tea at our tents. it was 5 hours of continuous up hill, through many\
  \ different terrains. Every step hurt, I looked forward and visualised how far we\
  \ have left and where we had to go. There was a constant battle running through\
  \ my mind of why am I doing this, how am I doing this, that I can not go further,\
  \ but then a thought would always come back pushing me that I can do this and just\
  \ take a few more steps. I would stop often take in the beautiful views, catch my\
  \ breath and gather my thoughts. Once I got to Dead Women\u2019s Pass, it was the\
  \ most rewarding moment, the views and feelings that were running through me, I\
  \ could never explain properly or I do not think I will ever experience again. The\
  \ next two days were still quite tough but nothing like that second day, but was\
  \ full of wonderful Inca sights and knowledge from our leaders. The moment we arrived\
  \ at Machu Picchu was slightly underwhelming as it was fully covered by cloud, although\
  \ it cleared very quickly and we were astounded be the beautiful view that Machu\
  \ Picchu was. I expected the end destination to be the best feeling and the most\
  \ rewarding, nonetheless it definitely was not, and this was the \u2018last thing\
  \ that I expected\u2019. The feelings I went through, the tough times, the self-motivation\
  \ and drive that I experienced was so much more rewarding than the end destination.\
  \ Peru was everything I did not expect I now respect their culture and lifestyle\
  \ so much more"
