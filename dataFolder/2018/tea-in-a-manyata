Text: "I awoke with a start as we turned off the main road and the Jeep began to shudder\
  \ on the uneven dirt track below. The dust kicked up by our slow progress left the\
  \ surroundings almost invisible. \n\nI was in a sleepy haze as I took in the scenery\
  \ on the drive from Nairobi to our safari camp in the Mara. As we left the city,\
  \ the landscape was green and plush with arable land displaying vibrant tea and\
  \ flower plantations. But the pleasant scenery disappeared when we came to the Rift\
  \ Valley. \n\nHere, a shift in plate tectonics years ago created a huge cliff edge\
  \ where you descend dramatically into the desert like brush. This is the home of\
  \ the Maasai tribesmen and Nilesh, Sahil\u2019s dad, had promised us we would stop\
  \ in an authentic Maasai village for a cup of tea on the way. \n\nNilesh had owned\
  \ a safari camp many years ago and had rented the land from a Maasai shepherd, Njaphet.\
  \ They had a good relationship such that Nilesh had been invited to his wedding\
  \ some nine years previous. It was the last time they had met in person. The day\
  \ was spectacular, he told us, with lots of chanting, jumping and dancing, but very\
  \ basic, taking place in their small community of mud huts, or Manyatas. \n\nWe\
  \ turned off the dirt track, through a gate opened by one of Njaphet\u2019s sons,\
  \ across a field with some stray goats ambling around.\n\nWe passed a school and\
  \ a church. There were electricity lines running up from the road between them.\
  \ The lines carried on up to Njaphet\u2019s cinder block house with not a single\
  \ mud structure in sight.\n\nWe sat comfortably on his leather sofas while Edith,\
  \ his wife, served us tea and Nilesh caught up with them joyfully in Swahili. \n\
  \nNjaphet sat there with a bright smile on his face. His ear lobes were stretched\
  \ and had big holes in them, which he had looped around the top of his ears to stop\
  \ them flapping inconveniently. The sunshine from the window reflected off his Rolex\
  \ into my eyes.\n\nThrough translation he told us they watch the English Premier\
  \ League on their TV and support Man Utd. He told me his children can speak English\
  \ but he was still learning and only at a first grade level. His current homework\
  \ was to learn a written list of \u2018essential\u2019 questions including \u2018\
  If you had 2,000 shillings, what would you do with them?\u2019, and \u2018Do you\
  \ have solar energy at your Manyata?\u2019. \n\nThey implored us to stay longer\
  \ but we were pressing on as we wanted to get one safari drive in before the sun\
  \ went down. The boys happily chased the jeep across the field as we left."
