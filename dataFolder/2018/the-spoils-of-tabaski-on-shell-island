Text: "In a fit of restless ambition we made our way from Dakar to a small fishing\
  \ village in the south of Senegal. We arrived early in the morning and before finding\
  \ a place to stay on the mainland of Joal we decided to take the stroll over the\
  \ narrow wooden bridge to the Island of Fadiouth. Our energy was immediately restored\
  \ at the sight of an island made entirely from layers of mollusks. Every step you\
  \ took was sounded by the alarm of tiny shells crunching beneath the soles of your\
  \ feet. The shells are also seamlessly incorporated into the architecture of the\
  \ island which is also a graveyard that is completely covered in empty clam homes.\
  \ It is the only cemetery in Senegal where both Christians and Muslims are buried.\n\
  \nAs time passed we realized that we were in Africa without a place to stay for\
  \ the night and quickly made our way over the bridge to find accommodations. We\
  \ came across a hotel \u201Cguarded\u201D by a man sunning himself on a rickety\
  \ lawn chair. We asked if he had any room available but with his limited English\
  \ and our limited French/Wolof he quickly seemed confused enough to call the owner.\
  \ He put me on the phone with another man I was unable to communicate with and shortly\
  \ after the man I had heard on the phone was standing in front of me grinning awkwardly.\n\
  \nWith his few words in English and my French translation book I was able to deduce\
  \ that I had pulled him away from a very important family holiday preparation. He\
  \ gave us a room and we apologized profusely for taking him from his family on a\
  \ holiday. He seemed unfazed and invited us over to his cottage to enjoy in the\
  \ spoils of Tabaski\u2013which we soon found out was a Muslim holiday where tradition\
  \ dictates that you celebrate by slaughtering a sheep.\n\n\nThis was apparent when\
  \ we strolled past mountains of sheep heads and bloody sheep legs strewn across\
  \ the beach on the way to his home.\n\n\nWhile this may seem horrific, this was\
  \ one of the most unique and warmest experiences of my entire life. We spent the\
  \ night communicating through laughter and charades with his family. This custom\
  \ also demands that they get a new tailor made outfit, go home to their families\
  \ and celebrate by eating mutton.\n\n\nAnd eat mutton we did. We ate from a joint\
  \ bowl with our hands from the same pot and the children danced to show off their\
  \ new dresses to the strangers in their midst. I could not have asked for a more\
  \ unique and intimate moment with strangers who invited us into their homes as family."
