Text: "The roads in Iceland can be treacherous, especially in winter. A disproportionate\
  \ number of drivers, mainly tourists have got into accidents by underestimating\
  \ mother nature and avoiding road closures, weather reports or simply cutting costs\
  \ on renting a vehicle without proper equipment. I grew up in Ontario, Canada and\
  \ was initially on the fence about renting a car while we were visiting in the middle\
  \ of December. I read online that you can get tires with studs or chains on them.\
  \ In all my thirty years of living in and around Toronto I\u2019ve never seen anyone\
  \ use snow chains or knew anyone who had metal studs on their tires. The more I\
  \ thought of this, the more I realized that driving in Iceland in winter was probably\
  \ not for me.\n\nI found a three-day tour that included stops at the Golden Circle,\
  \ The Black Sand Beach, The J\xF6kuls\xE1rl\xF3n Lagoon, a stop at an Ice Cave and\
  \ included a Glacier Hike. Leaving Reykjavik was an event onto itself, the guide\
  \ met us promptly at eight in the morning and told us that due to weather our tour\
  \ would have a change in itinerary. A bad storm was coming and if we didn\u2019\
  t get as far south as possible as quick as possible, we would likely be held up\
  \ somewhere for a few days. It was a race against time as we were leaving Reykjavik\
  \ as the police were getting ready to put out blockades to turn drivers back. The\
  \ road disappeared at various points, leaving only white car tracks to follow. The\
  \ black sand beach was our first and one of our most memorable stops. The beauty\
  \ of the waves and the beach guided me closer as if there was some siren in the\
  \ distance calling out to me. I managed to snap out of its trance and headed back\
  \ towards the group and safety. \n\nThe next day the weather was much worse, with\
  \ winds gusting and pounding our eighteen-passenger van all over the road. Our driver\
  \ opted to stop and put the chains on and we were able to gain a bit more control.\
  \ \n\nThe J\xF6kuls\xE1rl\xF3n Glacier Lagoon was beautiful, but also shocking as\
  \ its beauty is tied directly to the glaciers recession. Walking through the rows\
  \ of ice felt like walking over a grave, and this feeling left me deflated. Seeing\
  \ people stand on top of chunks of ice smiling in front of selfie sticks was like\
  \ going to The World Trade Memorial in New York City and seeing the same thing,\
  \ I guess people process grief differently. I didn\u2019t come to Iceland to see\
  \ the direct impacts of global warming, it was never my intention, but this experience\
  \ carried with me long after I left."
