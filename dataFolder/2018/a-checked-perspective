Text: "I looked up from the wrinkled map I\u2019d sprawled out on the ground, trying\
  \ desperately to shield it from the rain. Only a week ago, the same map I\u2019\
  d carefully selected from a Super Mart in Thamel had been a beacon of adventure.\
  \ Now I resented it, having been taken on the endless wind of overgrown paths that\
  \ make up Nepal\u2019s undulating Himalayas. I let out a groan and snatched up the\
  \ paper, shoving it in my jacket pocket in the same swoop. I continued my blind\
  \ descent through the downpour, reminiscing about the week prior when I lay in the\
  \ warmth of my hostel bed, safely tucked under the blankets, blissfully dry. Muddy\
  \ rain water now sloshed in the soles of my boots and squished between my toes.\
  \ And then I saw it; labelling a cluster of teahouses that had finally shown themselves:\
  \ Sidhing \u2013 three hours from my destination. I felt deadened by the cruel discovery,\
  \ clenching my jaw as I flung my pack to the ground with a thud. Bruised, blistered,\
  \ and irreversibly chilled, I sat to weigh my options of braving the storm or finding\
  \ a vacant teahouse. Amid bitter contemplation, my eyes fell to a small boy peering\
  \ at me from beside one of the buildings. He grinned as he saw me take notice and\
  \ signalled for me to join him. Intrigued, I collected my pack and cautiously followed\
  \ him up the crumbling steps into a small, cramped hut. The boy beamed at me as\
  \ he tugged the skirt of a woman tending to a pot of steaming rice. Maya and Sajit.\
  \ The mother and son introduced themselves as they implored me to join them for\
  \ dinner. Surprised by their immediate hospitality, I agreed with a nod. With a\
  \ palpable language barrier between us, our meal was enjoyed in cordial silence,\
  \ with an occasional offering for seconds of the makeshift dal-bhat. I looked around\
  \ at the tiny space, furnished solely with a hot plate, a shelf of spices and several\
  \ pillows in the corner I assumed functioned as a bed. I felt myself shrink as I\
  \ thought of the frustration I\u2019d felt only moments before. Without knowing\
  \ who I was or of my miserable self-indulgence, the two were more than willing to\
  \ invite me into their home and leave their own plates empty to fill a stranger's.\
  \ My cheeks burned as I looked at Maya, smiling at me inquisitively as she piled\
  \ more rice on my plate. Few words were exchanged in this small encounter and yet,\
  \ I'd been provided with a much-needed lesson in gratitude. Once the pot was empty,\
  \ I waved goodbye to my hosts and continued my trek in the rain with a checked perspective."
