Text: "There are no laws here\u2014my cousin claimed in reference to Maim\xF3n, the\
  \ small valley town we were in. I wondered then what the consequence of betraying\
  \ the de facto morals of its locals would be\u2014\"Lo sacan,\u201D he responds.\
  \ Exile.\n\nIt had been twelve years since i\u2019ve visited Dominican Republic,\
  \ yet I was quick to remember a key rule of survival; you have to let them try to\
  \ avoid you\u2014Through the car window, I noted the sight of our wayward surroundings.\
  \ Bemused as I observed the parallel between a local boy\u2014tediously swatting\
  \ a swarm of flies away from the roast pork he was sun-drying\u2014and us in traffic,\
  \ while a swarm of motorists threaded around us on the narrow streets of Bonao.\
  \ I marveled at how cleverly they loaded as much as four bodies onto those small\
  \ seats; balancing children, groceries, and the women; who brazenly replaced helmets\
  \ for \u201Ctubis,\u201D in preparation for the evening\u2019s New Year celebrations.\n\
  \nHere was the \u201Cdiscoteca,\u201D my cousin said, as we reached the town\u2019\
  s core. He rolled down the window, and I was immediately jolted out of the calm,\
  \ quiet space by the strength of the sounds bursting through; powerful, chaotic.\
  \ People of all ages were out on the streets \u201Cgoz\xE1ndo;\u201D drinking their\
  \ \u201Ccervezas\u201D under clouds of tobacco. Boomboxes mounted on car roofs boasting\
  \ the native music; merengues, reggaetones, bachatas, mixing in the open air, yet\
  \ no one seemed bothered by the clashing rhythms.\n\nIt was clear this was a community\
  \ that served as their own judge and jury, and regarded the status quo with the\
  \ same disposition one would give to unsolicited suggestions. \n\nI clued in that\
  \ I was in the presence of a resourceful people, and in awe at how they seemed to\
  \ reconstruct natural laws to materialize new realities and contentment.\n\nHere,\
  \ fallen \u201Cyaguas\u201D from royal palms become toboggans for children to slide\
  \ down the mountainous surroundings.\n\nRough pork skin pestered by flies; delicious\
  \ crackling.\n\n\u201CChinolas\u201D cut in halves; handy vessels for some sugar\
  \ and rum.\n\nA pothole ridden strip of road; the hottest club in town.\n\nA few\
  \ pieces of zinc metal sheets; a home.\n\nMy cousin guides me to a fruit tree; hands\
  \ me one of its fuzzy, maroon-purple berries. It reminded me of that old folk saying\
  \ that related the darkness of a fruit to the sweetness of its juice; I bit into\
  \ it\u2014exposing its blood red coloured flesh, and I couldn\u2019t help but laugh\
  \ at my ironic expectations\u2014as my eyes narrowed, my nose wrinkled, my lips\
  \ puckered in reflex to it\u2019s sharp, bitter taste."
