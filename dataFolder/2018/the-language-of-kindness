Text: "When in Athens, the living reality is a confluence of the past and the present.\
  \ In the presence of the Parthenon, a classical temple, I was a prime witness to\
  \ one of the finest works of ancient Greece. The December sun burst in between the\
  \ magnificent Doric columns casting gigantic shadows over irregular boulders that\
  \ lay in the vicinity of the ruined site. The south-eastern side is home to the\
  \ theatre of Dionysus which marks the beginning of the European theatre. On a fair\
  \ weathered day, one can see a minuscule model of a Greek orthodox church situated\
  \ on top of Lycabettus Hill. On the Western slopes, a prominent rock formation known\
  \ as the Areopagus boasts the presence of Apostle Paul and heralds the beginning\
  \ of the Christian era. \n\nOn climbing down the winding road that leads to the\
  \ Monastiraki square, I crossed a colourful array of restaurants with impressive\
  \ views of the Roman Agora and the temple of Hephaestus. On reaching the square,\
  \ I took a left and made my way towards the famous flea market. Luckily, it was\
  \ a Sunday and the shop windows were stocked with souvenirs that paid homage to\
  \ the spirit of Greece. In the midst of an uncertain and declining economy, the\
  \ Greeks fight their everyday battles with courage and a bold temperament. In the\
  \ market place, I was greeted with healthy handshakes and hearty smiles. \n\nLooking\
  \ around for the perfect souvenir to take back home, I was drawn towards a magnet\
  \ depicting the victory of Athina, the patron goddess of Athens, over Poseidon,\
  \ the ruler of the seas. I put my hand into my jeans\u2019 pocket to take out my\
  \ wallet only to find that it was missing! Even though most of my valuables were\
  \ left at the hotel, I was running short of \u20AC90. I informed the seller of my\
  \ loss and was about to leave when I was stopped short by a woman and a young boy.\
  \ I recognised them as the mother and son who were begging for alms in front of\
  \ the Hadrian\u2019s library. Before I could act, she paid three Euros to the seller\
  \ and placed the magnet in my hands. When I began my protest, she mumbled something\
  \ in Greek, took a polite bow and disappeared into the crowd. \n\nIn our brief encounter,\
  \ I noticed her shabby clothes and unkept hair. She was not past her forties and\
  \ the scar on her left cheek was either a result of an accident or experience, I\
  \ couldn't say. To this day, I know not what she had said but every time I look\
  \ at the magnet, it reminds me that \u201Csmall acts of kindness when multiplied\
  \ by millions of people, can transform the world\u201D."
