Text: "There was a squelching sound as my rubber boots, now covered in a thick layer\
  \ of dark mud, lifted from the ground. Had it really only been five hours?  I couldn\u2019\
  t remember anything about life prior to starting this trek. All I could see in my\
  \ mind\u2019s eye were mud, leaves, and our stopping point: a Waorani community\
  \ located in the Yasuni rainforest of Ecuador.  Gabo, our stoic guide and a member\
  \ of said community, could sense that our energy was ebbing. In a valiant attempt\
  \ to cheer us up, he exclaimed, \u201CI think I heard a caiman moving behind those\
  \ trees!  I\u2019ll go see if I can catch it!\u201D As he ran, barefoot, into the\
  \ undergrowth, I looked at Kate and Mekala. Kate was brushing sweat from her eyes.\
  \ Mekala was breathing heavily and covered in insect bites.  All around us was the\
  \ smell of damp earth and rain falling gently on large, flat leaves.  When we arrived\
  \ to the edge of the trail this morning, Gabo had been waiting to meet us, carrying\
  \ a blow dart gun and looking serious. Although he had walked this route hundreds\
  \ of times, this was his first journey with tourists. \u201CYou\u2019re just young\
  \ girls...I don\u2019t know if you can do this,\u201D he worried.  We had protested\
  \ forcefully, sure we were capable.  However, I was beginning to second-guess our\
  \ abilities.  Gabo was used to moving quickly through the jungle, and we found ourselves\
  \ running to keep up with his quick, sure strides.  The amazon rainforest was surprisingly\
  \ mountainous, and we had been scaling the same steep hill for what seemed like\
  \ an eternity. Despite the inevitable difficulties of a 10-hour trek through the\
  \ jungle, it wasn\u2019t hard to find the beauty in our surroundings.  Exotic birds\
  \ called from the trees above us, and we came across the freshly-trod footprints\
  \ of a tapir. Gabo was proud to share his extensive knowledge of the forest. He\
  \ showed us a \u201Cwalking tree,\u201D whose roots extended from the ground and\
  \ carried the massive tree above them to the nearest source of water, moving up\
  \ to an inch per year. I had never seen nature function so perfectly, free of human\
  \ interference. Gabo emerged, panting, from behind the trees. \u201CThat was a huge\
  \ caiman! I almost had him...but he got away.\u201D I was relatively certain that\
  \ the caiman was an invention to keep our spirits up, but I appreciated the effort.\
  \ I felt that we had formed a friendship with Gabo in that moment, and there was\
  \ a kind of understanding between us. A smile stretched across Gabo\u2019s face,\
  \ and the four of us shared a laugh before continuing the journey."
