Text: "Our shuttle driver spoke almost no English. My wife, Lanie, and I knew enough\
  \ Spanish to say \u201Chello\u201D and \u201CQuickly! Where is the bathroom!\u201D\
  \ but not much else. However, we brought a pocket-sized translation guide and decided\
  \ to try it out during the three-hour ride to a Costa Rican resort.\n\nLanie flipped\
  \ through the book, piecing together sentences like \u201Cwere you born under Albania\u201D\
  \ or \u201Cwhat color is the brown hair you\u2019re wearing.\u201D \n\nThe man waited\
  \ patiently as she created questions, or figured out his answers. It became a game\
  \ and we all cheered each time something was correctly deciphered.\n\nEventually,\
  \ we ran out of things to ask and rode quietly until we approached the center of\
  \ a large town. Suddenly, our driver spoke up.\n\nGlancing at us in the rear-view\
  \ mirror, he said, \u201CDantanatanas.\u201D\n\nMy meager Spanish toolkit included\
  \ \u201Cplease speak more slowly.\u201D With no idea what he blurted out, I replied,\
  \ \u201Chabla m\xE1s despacio, por favor.\u201D\n\nThe driver gave me a puzzled\
  \ look in the mirror, but said, more slowly, \u201CDantanatanas.\u201D\n\nI stared\
  \ blankly back. \u201CDantanatanas\u201D he repeated. \u201CDANTANATANAS.\u201D\n\
  \nLanie seemed to think it would help if she flipped through the guidebook at light\
  \ speed.\n\n\u201CDantanatanas.\u201D he said again. \u201CDANTANATANAS\u201D, he\
  \ exclaimed, hands out and palms up in the universal sign for \u201Cwhat is wrong\
  \ with you people.\u201D\n\nWe both stared at the suddenly useless book, making\
  \ now-what faces in uncomfortable silence. We avoided eye contact with the driver,\
  \ and each other. \n\nThe driver finally shrugged and turned back around. I carefully\
  \ inspected the window trim while Lanie pretended to search through her purse. We\
  \ did anything we could to look distracted or busy.\n\nSuddenly, we came face to\
  \ face with a large sign. In big, English letters it said, \"Atenas Grocery.\"\n\
  \nI slapped my forehead like a cartoon character and said, \u201CAtenas aqui!!!\u201D\
  \n\nThe driver raised his fists in the symbol of victory as if I had solved world\
  \ hunger.\n\n\u201CSi, Senor!\u201D he exclaimed. \u201CAtenas AQUI!\u201D\n\nAtenas.\
  \ We were in downtown Atenas, or \u201Cdan tan atanas.\u201D Lanie and I were both\
  \ so certain he was still speaking Spanish that we never made the mental jump back\
  \ to our own language. \n\nInternational crisis averted, we resumed our flip-and-quip\
  \ method of communication until we arrived at our resort where we shared a good\
  \ laugh with our driver.\n\nReturning to the airport four days later, one of us\
  \ would grin and comment, \u201Cdantanatanas\u201D as we passed through each village.\n\
  \nOur new driver didn\u2019t understand."
