Text: "His eyes were deep brown, mine bright blue.\n\n\u201C\xA1Hola!\u201D\n\n\u201C\
  Hello?\u201D\n\nIt was my first time out of the safe blanket of protection, first\
  \ time away from my family, the first time I had ever been on a travel adventure\
  \ without my parents.\nAt the age of 13 and in a country where I knew none of the\
  \ language, everything seemed like an adventure.\n\nJuan Carlos was no exception.\n\
  \nHe was my first - my first real love.\n\nSneaking away from adult supervision,\
  \ we ran down the Mexican hillside to the market in the town below to explore the\
  \ world in childish bliss and young love.\nHis broken English and my five words\
  \ of Spanish were all we needed to make our way through the vendors and find our\
  \ way to happiness. The feel of his hand in mine was all I noticed as we darted\
  \ between tortilla vendors, cars driving through the streets selling bananas over\
  \ their loud speakers, and children pleading for me to buy their jewelry. The noise\
  \ of the day was muted by the pounding of my heart; all I heard was amor. \n\nThe\
  \ week of volunteer relief work quickly became secondary; to be close to Juan Carlos\
  \ whenever possible was my new purpose for being alive. The feel of his warm, brown\
  \ gaze locked on me as I worked sorting glasses and queuing people into line for\
  \ eye exams made it hard to concentrate.\n\nHis quick smile, which was always a\
  \ precursor to a laugh, made my heart flutter. At the age of 15, he was older, seemed\
  \ wiser, and was forbidden. I was willing to make it work forever because, unbeknownst\
  \ to me, he had a key to a door in my heart that I didn\u2019t know existed until\
  \ I stepped onto Mexican soil. \n\nHe unlocked it with one long, deep gaze into\
  \ my soul.\n\nThe love note he pressed into my hand and kiss on my cheek as we loaded\
  \ up the vans to make the drive back to the United States filled me with joy and\
  \ then profound sadness. As we left, my heart stayed with Juan Carlos and tears\
  \ ran down my cheeks. Empty and unable to truly communicate my feelings of loss,\
  \ I simply watched the Mexican coastline pass me by, my heart breaking a little\
  \ more each mile we travelled.\n\nThe letters were frequent and flirty, until they\
  \ were not. \n\nA piece of my heart will forever live in Mexico with a brown-eyed\
  \ boy named Juan Carlos. Now a man and over two decades later, I wonder if he remembers\
  \ the tall, pale, blue-eyed girl who gave him a piece of her heart."
