Text: "Guilin. Might have never heard of it, or maybe you have, but for those it doesn\u2019\
  t ring a bell. Have you ever seen those mountain range painings in the chinese restaurants\
  \ where there is a house in a very high top pointy hill? I always thought they were\
  \ part of the chinese imaginery. I was wrong . These mountains exist and they\u2019\
  re called the moon mounts, their located in the Guangxi northeast city of Guilin\
  \ and surroundings, around the Li river. \nThese mounts have been home for ghost\
  \ and dragons stories that spread around china for centuries and they are breath\
  \ taking. \nI chose a mid january day to visit them. The mist that floated around\
  \ this mountain range made them difuse and somewhat unreal. We took a small imitation\
  \ of a chinese bamboo boat in the town of DaXu to sail around the river and through\
  \ the mountan range. These little boats have sailed the river for centuries, historians\
  \ believe they started during the Han dynasty and created a trade route from the\
  \ Yangtze pains up to the further southern regions. These boats were also the first\
  \ line of defense against invadors and the fishing boats that fed most of the population\
  \ of these enclosed villages. Now they\u2019re a tourist claim and the main busses\
  \ and school transport in the area, given the difficulty of traversing the mountains.\
  \ \nIt astonished me that the mounts have been left in their natural state rather\
  \ than being exploited. China is not know for their enviromentalism and the graystone\
  \ they use in decorational carvings comes from the soil of this area. But it seem\
  \ like they do appreciate their natural riches, and so far the mounts remain intact.\
  \ \nThis little bamboo imitation boat was not the only one we sailed that day. Further\
  \ south in the Li river bank there is another town called Yangsu. This town has\
  \ bigger boats and it is more known and touristic than DaXu since its\u2019 scenery\
  \ was used as the back side image of the 20 yuan notes. The mounts here are rounder,\
  \ situated at both sides of a very shallow river that is hard to sail over, but\
  \ they somehow managed. The mist was still turning the mounts further to me in a\
  \ strange shade of gray and for a moment it was not hard to realize why these mountains\
  \ where the comon ground for stories.\nHowever beautiful the Moon Mounts are, they\
  \ are not the only thing Guilin has to offer. \nFir lake with the Sun and Moon pagodas,\
  \ the elephant rock park or the seven stars park or the Banyan pavillion will provide\
  \ you with plenty to admire during your stay."
