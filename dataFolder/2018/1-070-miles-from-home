Text: "Walking along the shaded, terracotta coloured cobbled streets I was struck\
  \ by the most unusual reminder of home, of the rolling hills and quaint cottages\
  \ of rural England.\nIt was the scent of melting butter that drew me in like the\
  \ aroma of nectar calls to a hummingbird, nose first, which I followed all the way\
  \ along the cramped Calle Larga S. Marco, running adjacent to the Basilica di San\
  \ Marco, until I reached a small restaurant perched on the corner of the street\
  \ just before a small stone bridge. The restaurant was illuminated in warm colours,\
  \ squashed beneath several sun-bleached bricked flats, and it\u2019s tiny turquoise\
  \ doors, barely five foot tall, were flung open to allow the humid air to float\
  \ through on the barest wind.\nThe hair at the back of my neck clung to my skin\
  \ in sweaty ringlets and the palms of my hands had left wet marks on my linen shorts\
  \ when I\u2019d tried to dry them. My previous purchase at Liberia Acqua Alta weighing\
  \ in the crook of my arm, my small shoulder bag, and a half forgotten makeshift\
  \ paper fan sodden with perspiration my only luggage. I didn\u2019t take up much\
  \ room with so little, but the frenzy of tourists streaming backwards and forwards\
  \ in an unending current did all that they could to bump and knock me, as if I were\
  \ a gondola caught in the open ocean and thrown about by the barest swell. \nAn\
  \ uncomfortable heat had greeted me upon my arrival days ago, and had stayed with\
  \ me as I explored this city of narrow streets, fragrant foods and lively music.\
  \ Unused to it, I perspired like a sinner in a holy site, much to the amusement\
  \ of some locals and many tourists. It was also much to my disgust.\nMy discomfort\
  \ was forgotten however, when I saw the chef through a little window on the side\
  \ of the restaurant. She wore a white chef\u2019s shirt which was immaculate, but\
  \ the apron around her waist was painted with the day\u2019s orders. She was indeed\
  \ melting butter, a great slab of it in a giant pan, into which she threw handfuls\
  \ of minced garlic, parsley and chopped tomatoes. Instantly, my mouth watered and\
  \ so far from home I remembered summers spent eating butter softened tomatoes.\n\
  My stomach rumbled as I entered the restaurant, now feeling more at home in this\
  \ one petite place than the entirety of this sultry country."
