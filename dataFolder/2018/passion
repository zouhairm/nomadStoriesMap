Text: "In our lives sometimes we need to change n evolve ourselves according to the\
  \ situations.\nbut, what if the situation you are in pushes u even more towards\
  \ your passion.? same happened to me...,,\nwhile growing up just a kid I still remember\
  \ I use to wonder that some day I'll be travelling the world coz somewhere I still\
  \ feel that I was born to do this...and I don't have any problem untill and unless\
  \ I achieve my goal...\nAs I was a commerce student in the school..n after that\
  \ my intensions were to go for BBA and MBA after that but, instead went for hotel\
  \ management...and because I always wanted to travel so I decided to persue the\
  \ hospitality management course..but, here in our country it's  a kind of useless\
  \ for youngsters like me because we are only know for cooking food...that's all...so\
  \ I stood unemployed even after successfully completing the course...\nas I mentioned\
  \ earlier I always wanted to be a part of profession that makes me able to go out\
  \ around the globe and explore the people,culture,food and most importantly the\
  \ writing part of my travel diary..unfortunately that did not happened but, I'm\
  \ sure that some day I would be able to get my dream job...because only I know how\
  \ much passionate I am for this...\nthe systems, responsibilities, disappointments,\
  \ failures, success,in this little life span of 22 years I have almost seen all\
  \ but, i'm positive and optimistic about my passion..\nso, as our topic concerned\
  \ the decision that pushed me to the edge was to stay at one particular place because\
  \ i'm not that kinda guy who just is happy to stay at one place I always wanted\
  \ change, adventure, exploring people,cultures,and sit back and write something\
  \ about my experiences.. and always wanted to be surrounded by strangers.\nand always\
  \ wanted share my word and learn something from the world because our planet has\
  \ alot to offer.\nbut, as parents guided I walked my way but now am really tired\
  \ of making fake promises as the thing I want to do is might be out of my financial\
  \ budget.\nthat was the thing that made me feel to never mention this to anyone\
  \ because of financial problems.\nso all and all my am surely confident and optimistic\
  \ to convert my passion into profession...as an old saying that anything and everything\
  \ happens for a reason.. today I believe that sayings' right because that brought\
  \ me here..and I will not rest the writing only for one essay I have posted for\
  \ now..but, continue this untill I achieve what I want to...\nthanks alot for this\
  \ opportunity...\U0001F64F"
