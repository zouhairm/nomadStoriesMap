Text: "My host in Dubrovnik, a tall skinny man in his late 60s, greeted me warmly.\
  \ We entered my car, and I was about to ask him where to go, but language failed\
  \ me. I didn't speak Croatian, my English was really poor back then, and it didn't\
  \ look like his was any better. We could discuss directions by simply pointing,\
  \ but the ride ahead required more creativity.\nI tried my broken English, which\
  \ the man echoed to confirm that yes, he was from Dubrovnik, \u201Cborn here\u201D\
  . He was amused to tell me how many Italians visit his city in summertime. \u201C\
  Only us?\u201D I played along, prompting him to list basically every Western country\
  \ he could think of. Some words seemed to be better understood in Italian than in\
  \ English, to which he replied with Croatian and eloquent gesturing.\nMeanwhile,\
  \ we left the city centre and headed uphill, from where I could spot the red rooftops\
  \ of Dubrovnik ringed by the city walls.\nA strong-looking woman was waiting at\
  \ the house, and declining her offers to take my luggage was quite an effort. The\
  \ man introduced her as his wife and excused himself. As he disappeared into the\
  \ house, it amazed me how nodding, mumbling, laughing, pretending to understand,\
  \ and saying certain words overly loud had gone a long way to keep up our conversation.\n\
  I now knew the man's daughter was living in Spain and he had one more son, whose\
  \ whereabouts I didn't grasp; he lived in Dubrovnik all his life, including during\
  \ the war in the 1990s (a topic he dismissed quickly); he had never heard of my\
  \ hometown, but he knew of the one I was living in, Trieste, near the border with\
  \ Croatia, which he would like to visit; he had never been to Italy, to his regret;\
  \ he used to work as a carpenter, was now retired but still took on the occasional\
  \ job here and there; renting out rooms during summer, however, provided him and\
  \ his wife with more than they needed.\nIn other words: we had got acquainted.\n\
  The woman showed me to my room and made me understand she would meet me on the terrace\
  \ later. When I joined her there, she had laid out some peanuts and a labelless\
  \ litre bottle of red wine, on which the 4pm August sun shone discordantly.\n\"\
  Just a little bit,\" I said, miming an amount that roughly corresponded to a quarter\
  \ of a glass.\nThe woman nodded smiling, filled the glass up to the brim, and left\
  \ me to my early aperitivo, with the wide-open Adriatic Sea as a backdrop.\nI'm\
  \ sure she understood my restrictive request, but ignoring it was a matter of local\
  \ hospitality, a universally-spoken language."
