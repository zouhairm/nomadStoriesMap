Text: "\u201CAllora,\u201D Marco, a local fisherman announces his arrival at our campsite\
  \ in Rivabella, bearing his fruits of the sea in the back of his red truck. We buy\
  \ his fresh fish and prawns and pan-fry them in garlic and olive oil as per Marco\u2019\
  s instruction.\n\nSince arriving in Italy\u2019s southern region of Puglia we have\
  \ followed the coast road, never far from the sea- the Adriatic or the Ionian. Everywhere\
  \ there is an industry of seafaring or agriculture, especially the vast olive groves\
  \ that carpet the land. Once considered the  downtrodden heel of Italy\u2019s famed\
  \ boot, Puglia has emerged as the unexpected wildcard in the Italian beauty competition.\
  \ Considering the other regions vying for the prize, Puglia triumphs with her unmistaken\
  \ Mediterranean lifestyle.\n\nIt\u2019s an obvious formula: glorious weather, white\
  \ sandy beaches and ancient cities resplendent with ornamented history. In Lecce,\
  \ we are dazzled by the baroque embellished limestone old town and we find our faith\
  \ in the handsome churches of Martina Franca. The humble trulli houses in Alberobello\
  \ emblazoned with ancient astrological symbols pique our curiosity and we marvel\
  \ at the simple sophistication of the white washed town of Ostuni. \n\nDespite this\
  \ facade, Puglia remains one of Italy\u2019s poorest region and we notice a style\
  \ of cooking known as \u2018cucina povera\u2019 (peasant fare).  Born from necessity,\
  \ economics dictates that ingredients are minimal, always local yet deliciously\
  \ fresh. Farmers markets abound in plump aubergines, zucchini flowers, olives of\
  \ course, red peppers and plump cherry tomatoes off the vine. We sample pizza sprinkled\
  \ delicately with sharp mozzarella and hand made pasta with a strange twist: ear-shaped\
  \ orecchiette. All washed down with a local ros frizzante that sparkles in the Salento\
  \ sunshine. \n\nBack to Marco though. He tells us that his family have a farm and\
  \ presents us with a box of ripe apricots that have dropped in the summer heat.\
  \ There are also fresh figs that he suggests are a true Puglian delicacy with ricotta.\
  \ \u201CAllora,\u201D he stands making moves to leave us to our lunch. I love how\
  \ that word rolls beautifully into every exchange. Allora: in that case, so, um,\
  \ ah, therefore. It punctuates the space that silence could easily inhabit. This\
  \ is the reason I love Italy. Just as the expression \u2018Allora\u2019 is not always\
  \ necessary in conversation it encapsulates an Italian essence. From food to architecture,\
  \ these understated nuances exist in Italy and transform the simple into the sublime."
