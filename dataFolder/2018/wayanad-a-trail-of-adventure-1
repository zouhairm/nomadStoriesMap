Text: "It was one of those usual Bangalore weekends when we usually took a siesta\
  \ from profound work or just funded food delivery apps. Devoid of plans. We were\
  \ in a part of the world where weather is never predictable. Though it was raining\
  \ cats and dogs; I just called up my travel buddy and he knew the rest was hazardous.\
  \ \nWayanad; a part of Kerala, South India is quite an expedition; where amongst\
  \ the hilly green terrains of coffee plantation lies the second highest peak of\
  \ south India. It was not surprising as we often hop around for trips to satisfy\
  \ our travel addiction. Though this one was quite unusual, Wayanad has an easy road\
  \ access from Bangalore one of which crosses a few forest terrains and a national\
  \ park (Tiger Reserve). But the twist was to choose my bike as a transit. Indeed,\
  \ with minimalist research and a short preparation we started off. A lot of navigation\
  \ and a morning 8-hour drive was self explanatory. Manoeuvring some curvaceous roads,\
  \ deadly turns and mesmerising views we halted at one of nearby local homestay.\
  \ Dawn was still hours away, so we headed towards a nearby spot named Kuruvu Islands.\
  \ This island hosts rare kinds of flora and fauna. Its exclusive geographical location\
  \ and evergreen silence makes the place an ideal retreat for tourists.\nAfter taking\
  \ a tiny power nap come sunrise we headed for a nature trek towards Chembra peak.\
  \ Drenched by the drizzle, it was steep and one of the toughest trek ever. Our guide\
  \ was quite impressive, adeptly climbing, wearing a pair of sneakers and hands folded\
  \ back. Walking in the dense fog, along innumerable streams, mesmerising wind and\
  \ waving grass we stood near a large water body. As soon as the fog left us, we\
  \ were awestruck by a huge heart shaped lake. This lake as informed by our guide\
  \ never dries. The beauty of the peak capturing sky in lake was extraordinary. \
  \ We spent some memorable moments and departed. Soon the sun was ready to set. Despite\
  \ no resources, battery back-up and a language barrier we decided to get back home\
  \ before sunrise. We opted to head the traditional way by asking locals. Subsequently\
  \ driving since 3 long hours through dark woods, creepy slopes we verified ourselves\
  \ \u2018being lost\u2019. Just out of the blue we saw a small provisional store.\
  \ I enquired about the location and that added a new version of dilemma to my life.\
  \ We reached another peak quite opposite to where we were heading. Now this brings\
  \ on the fun! Midnight, lost in the wild and on a new trail of adventure!"
