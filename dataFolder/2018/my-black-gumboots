Text: "The last thing I expected when I bought a ten dollar pair of gumboots, was\
  \ for them to almost cost me my life. There I was, standing on the edge of a mountain\
  \ path in Slovakia, certain that I would fall down the icy slopes if I took another\
  \ step.\n\u201CJust hold on to the tree ahead,\u201D coaxed Simona, in her thick\
  \ Slovakian accent.\nBut I couldn\u2019t. My boots had no grip, and with each step,\
  \ I uncontrollably slid a few inches along the icy path. There was no railing and\
  \ nothing to catch my fall but the trees below.\nSimona\u2019s young husky played\
  \ in the snow as she happily awaited the hike upwards. The dog was at home in the\
  \ mountains, as was Simona. Her long blonde hair and fair features connected her\
  \ to the area in a way that my useless boots and dark European traits did not. Simona\
  \ had always lived in Terchov\xE1, a large village in a valley of the Mal\xE1 Fatra\
  \ Mountains, in Northern Slovakia.\n\u201CLook at the view!\u201D offered my brother\
  \ Dan, who was trying to calm me down.\nThe view was beautiful. In fact, it was\
  \ incredible. The sun was slowly fading behind the high mountain tops, which gave\
  \ the tall mountain range a luminous blue tint.\nThe natural beauty of Terchov\xE1\
  \ is largely untouched. The small hiking paths were mostly empty of tourists, and\
  \ the air was still and quiet. It was a surreal moment, having travelled there from\
  \ a succession of lively cities, I\u2019d never experienced such complete silence\
  \ in my life. The thick layers of snow seemed to absorb the noise from the world\
  \ below.\nPerhaps this is why I could hear my heart thumping in my chest. I was\
  \ frozen. Not from the -6\u2070C chill, or the icy snow, but from the terror of\
  \ slipping off the open path in my poorly considered gumboots.\n\u201CCan I take\
  \ them off?\u201D I pleaded.\n\u201CAbsolutely not, you\u2019ll get frostbite,\u201D\
  \ reasoned Simona. She seemed entirely unfazed by the situation. It was a part of\
  \ her daily routine, walking her excited husky up the winding slopes, and if she\
  \ had ever experienced anxiety over the steep climb, she showed no signs of it now.\n\
  \u201CLet\u2019s just turn around and head back slowly,\u201D proposed Simona.\n\
  I was disappointed, and I knew Dan was too. The view from the top was sure to be\
  \ stunning, but, by now, my legs were shaking and I was close to tears.\n\u201C\
  It\u2019s okay,\u201D consoled Dan, \u201Cwe\u2019ll try again tomorrow.\u201D\n\
  We both knew there would be no tomorrow. A pair of gumboots had ruined my chance\
  \ to enjoy one of the best views in Slovakia.\nThat small glimpse of the vast mountain\
  \ ranges would have to suffice for this unprepared traveller."
