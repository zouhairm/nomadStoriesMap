Text: "Oh Canada you beauty how I miss your powdery powdery mountains.  I was just\
  \ snowboarding through the trees avoiding the tree wells the best I could when bam\
  \ I see a rope line with cliff clearly plastered all over it. I couldn\u2019t go\
  \ left I couldn\u2019t go right and I sure as hell wasnt going to hike back up.\
  \ I had a glance over the edge, lined up and then thought to myself just jump\n\
  It\u2019ll be fine. It was at the moment I popped as I left the powdery ground it\
  \ occurred to me I had no idea how deep the powder on the landing would be. As I\
  \ landed I got sucked waist deep down into the landing but I was calm and not neck\
  \ deep. I dug down to my bindings to unclip wondering if anyone may stumble upon\
  \ me. I unclipped pulled my board out and then began to wade / swim through the\
  \ waist deep powder. After about 10 minutes I made it to firmer less powdery ground\
  \ and thanked my lucky stars that I hadn\u2019t broken anything or suffocated in\
  \ a powdery tree well. I strapped in and eventually ended up in a gully that popped\
  \ me out back on piste. I rode down to the lift where my buddy had been waiting\
  \ for me for the last 45 minutes wondering where on earth I ended up. Little did\
  \ he know about the decision that pushed me to the edge of both my snowboarding\
  \ ability and lack of common sense. Oh Canada you beauty how I miss your powdery\
  \ powdery mountains."
