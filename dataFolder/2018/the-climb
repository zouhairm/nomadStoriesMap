Text: "I\u2019m standing on the edge of a mountain top, staring out at the continental\
  \ divide and the forested expanse that stands between me and the ocean. It\u2019\
  s hot - the kind of hot that feels like a suffocating fog, one that wraps around\
  \ you until the sun sets each night and the ground finally cools. I\u2019m in what\
  \ they call a \u2018Cloud Forest\u2019 but there\u2019s not a puff of white to be\
  \ seen in the sky and the trees are bright and green and lush on the ground below.\
  \ \n\nI\u2019m not deterred by the way my chest heaves or by the way the three hours\
  \ spent hiking to this point - three hours full of misery and self-doubt - disappear\
  \ when I\u2019m standing at this apex, witnessing the place where the sky apparently\
  \ parts to the seas. \n\nExploring is where I\u2019ve found solace, I realize as\
  \ I stand on this dividing line. The culture, the people, the food. The slap in\
  \ the face of things that are different from the world of familiarity that I\u2019\
  ve grown up in. It\u2019s like a balm to rub in the deepest of wounds and every\
  \ moment experiencing the world beyond my city limits brings me further out of the\
  \ void that\u2019s haunted me for a year. \n\nStanding on this glorified hill I\
  \ feel as if the journey to this place was more than just a jaunt up a mountainside\
  \ road. It was about sharing the moments around the dinner table, beans and the\
  \ fruit of the day prepared in six different ways as conversations with my companions\
  \ ranged from stories from home to the beauty of the volcano spitting in the distance.\
  \ It was about sharing our lives and finding new ways to connect with strangers\
  \ from different places, people who didn\u2019t know where you came from but saw\
  \ a piece of themselves in you. \n\nA year before this moment I was locked in a\
  \ hole that seemed impossible to climb out of, one constructed by my own mind and\
  \ inflicted on me daily until it became hard to breathe. I didn\u2019t know how\
  \ to escape what had become my own personal prison and so I ran and ran until I\
  \ ended up on this mountainside, staring out at a place of division that made everything\
  \ seem so much clearer. \n\nThe journey between here and there was about more than\
  \ just the physical climb. It was about every moment of moving forward, of trying\
  \ new things and seeing the world from a different vantage point. Reaching the crest\
  \ of the continental divide meant clawing my way out of the hole I\u2019d been living\
  \ in until I could see the way forward spread out ahead of me. \n\nI\u2019m standing\
  \ on the edge of a mountain top and finally there\u2019s a future that I didn\u2019\
  t see before."
