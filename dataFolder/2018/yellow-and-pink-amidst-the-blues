Text: "I was listening with closed eyes to the salty waves crashing on the triangular\
  \ rocks when an innocent, husky voice broke my reverie.\n\"Excuse me didi, can you\
  \ give me 30 rupees for vadapao?\" \nI\u2019d closed my eyes because I was struggling\
  \ with the dilemma of what to look at - the glimmering sea, or the glorious skyline?\
  \ (Both of which converged in front of me to make Mumbai city look just as dreamy\
  \ as I thought) I opened them to see a brown, freckled face with unkempt hair and\
  \ eyes that glinted with both innocence and tragedy. \n\"30 rupees! Which vadapao\
  \ is this, now?\" I asked him. \"It's my favourite, didi, and I'm very hungry. Please\
  \ didi!\" he reiterated. My friends had hyped me up plenty about the city\u2019\
  s famous street food. \"Okay, but take me with you\", I told him. \nAs we manoeuvred\
  \ through the crowded streets between the art deco buildings of South Mumbai, I\
  \ unearthed the many layers of my new companion. Rohan was a 12-year-old orphan\
  \ who lived on the shores of Chowpatty beach. He went to a government school in\
  \ the morning and sold pens at Marine Drive in the evening. In the city of dreams\
  \ where everyone landed to become a Bollywood actor or singer, he was an aspiring\
  \ architect.\nNow munching on the truly delicious vadapao, he pointed towards a\
  \ blue-glassed skyscraper that stood out because of its uneven structure and said:\
  \ \"That's Antilla, the most expensive residence in the world\". The darkening sky\
  \ made me glance at my watch and I announced that my train departs in half an hour.\
  \ He insisted on walking me to the nearest station: \"It's only a 10-minute walk,\
  \ didi. The cab will take time; there\u2019s so much traffic\u201D. \nWhen the clock\
  \ struck 6, the Victoria Terminus train station lit up in hues of pink and yellow.\
  \ He was busy explaining to me the gothic architecture of the building, and I was\
  \ busy trying to get him to pose for a quick picture before we parted ways. In the\
  \ end, we met halfway - I got a blurry picture of him passionately blabbering about\
  \ the gargoyles. \n\nMy train passed through the third largest slum in the world,\
  \ ironically located in Mumbai - the economic capital of India. I shifted my gaze\
  \ from the blue slum to the yellow tinted picture in my hand - of an independent\
  \ twelve-year-old who lived in a hut but aspired to become an architect. His gleaming\
  \ eyes reflected the horizon which, just like the city, merged two opposing worlds.\
  \ \n If there was one picture that could describe this city, I thought \u2013 this\
  \ was it."
