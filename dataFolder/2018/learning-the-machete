Text: "There was no witness to my first swing of the ubiquitous Guatemalan tool. My\
  \ eyes jumped away on impact and the coconut sprung from the chopping block. That\
  \ day I resolved to sharpen my machete skills. \n   My tent was perched a thirty\
  \ minute hike up the West side of the valley. From there I could watch the south\
  \ wind, Xocomil as the Mayan call him, ripple across the lake. Three volcanos lined\
  \ the shore where ancient sites stood one hundred feet below the surface. The water\
  \ is still rising. Half submerged restaurants, villas, farms and docks remind the\
  \ indigenous and expatriated alike of one rule under the same wild law. \n   The\
  \ sun rose over pointed silhouettes as I studied the gardener\u2019s dance. He was\
  \ pruning the overgrown path above the banana leaves, below the pines. The machete\
  \ traced fluid arcs as he whistled. Swift discernment spared the amaranth stalks.\n\
  \   My wet suit was a cool relief on the hike. When the forest opened to a field\
  \ of dry brush it was clear that I had never taken this path home before. I remembered\
  \ one of the locals mentioning a throughway across the valley near here, so I went\
  \ on to find it. A new view opened and I turned to take it in. Now there was a man\
  \ below, his face wrapped in black.\n   I turned up the path and felt his body closer,\
  \ a hand around my wrist. A machete lifted above our heads. My heart sank as I peered\
  \ into his young eyes. \u201CWhat are you doing?\u201D spilled out. \u201CWhy are\
  \ you doing this?\u201D\n  He gestured to the sack in my hand and reflex pulled\
  \ it behind me. He jerked the blade and his eyes jumped from side to side. \u201C\
  Callate!\u201D \u201CCallate!\u201D he barked in a hush.\n   A protective rage boiled\
  \ up from some deep place. The sound roared through the high trees waking friends\
  \ from their naps and the troubled boy ran down the mountain. \n   I spent the next\
  \ months machete-in-hand honing agility and discernment, pruning the paths. I discovered\
  \ many trails holding stories dark with political violence, raw with the friction\
  \ of colonization. The heart of the village is alive with ancient language and evolving\
  \ art. A dozen temples from around the world call this valley home, most share a\
  \ reverence for the rich cultural wisdom in the symbols of Mayan spirituality.\n\
  \   A fresh mural catches my eye. Tucked in a psychedelic mandala I recognize the\
  \ Mayan calendar sign of Ajmaj; a single stroke hinting of a staff, a serpent, and\
  \ a stylized question mark. \u201CThe day Ajmaj,\u201D a young shaman told me outside\
  \ his seed house, \u201Cis a day for forgiveness.\u201D"
