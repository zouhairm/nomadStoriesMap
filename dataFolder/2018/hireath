Text: "Walking into the woods felt like walking directly into the Hemingway\u2019\
  s novel. I almost felt like a central character of the themed story until I lost\
  \ my way. It was fun until I started walking alone into the unknown, parting away\
  \ from my fellow travelers. But after a while, I felt peaceful than ever. I kept\
  \ on walking for a couple of hours hoping to find someone to cling onto, so that\
  \ I can find my way out. It must be around 5 O'clock and no sign of a single living\
  \ entity. Well, I was expecting someone who would understand my language or at least\
  \ the signs. \n\nMatikochar is not just the woods but the wildlife sanctuary and\
  \ definitely not recommended at all to get lost alone, all by you. I was parched\
  \ and suddenly I heard footsteps. In jungle, the obvious thing that would hit my\
  \ conscious was this might be my last visit to such a beautiful place. But I never\
  \ give up (not so easily), so in my defense I picked up a wooden log lying beside\
  \ me. I raised it in hurry and the moment I would release it in the air, I saw a\
  \ pair of deep blue eyes staring back at me. I didn\u2019t know who it was but it\
  \ relieved me to know that he understood me. He waved at me to follow him. \n\n\
  I followed him hastily and introduced myself. He didn\u2019t say much apart from\
  \ his name. We walked for few minutes and reached his tent. He offered me a cup\
  \ of hot tea and asked if I wanted to freshen up, I nodded in agreement. Without\
  \ uttering a word he stepped out of the tent to give me some space and privacy.\
  \  I changed into a fresh pair of clothes and stepped out. The sky was almost dark\
  \ but I could see him staring at me. We talked about the place I was coming from\
  \ and what I did for living. \n\nThe temperature was dropping gradually so we decided\
  \ to make a bonfire and our conversation took a magical turn. I spoke about everything\
  \ in the world. He told me some stories from his childhood and how travelling into\
  \ the mountains molded him into the person he became. We covered every topic from\
  \ language to literature, from people to pebbles. I remember him enlightening me\
  \ with a Welsh word Hireath. It means a longing for a home you can\u2019t return\
  \ to, or one that was never yours. Not necessarily a house, but a homely feeling\
  \ such as love. \n\nThe bonfire blazed away for hours and we drifted off to sleep.\n\
  \nWhen I started walking towards Chanderkani the next day, I felt a void in my heart\
  \ and I understood why his eyes were moist when he said Hireath."
