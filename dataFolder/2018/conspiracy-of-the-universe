Text: "They say it\u2019s a small world and I know it\u2019s true, but sometimes the\
  \ Universe is able to really surprise you. \nI\u2019m landing in Bali to meet the\
  \ result of an absolute conspiracy of the Universe.\n\nI know how to ignore the\
  \ multitude of taxi drivers budgering me: I go straight to Wayan and his car. I\
  \ met him on my previous trip to the island and I saved his card for no apparent\
  \ reason \u2013 I surely didn\u2019t think I would go back so soon. I ask Wayan\
  \ to leave me a few roads away from the guesthouse. I want to feel Bali again.\n\
  I walk the tiny streets, where the sidewalk is just a sequence of concrete slab\
  \ covering the drains. I look down, not only to watch my step but mostly to look\
  \ for canang sari \u2013 the typical offering where colorful flowers meet braided\
  \ leaves and host a little rice or a cracker. What I love the most about Bali can\u2019\
  t be seen. It\u2019s late in the morning but I can still smell it all around me:\
  \ incense. Back home after my trip, I used to light up an incense stick to pretend\
  \ I was still on the island. But now there\u2019s no need to pretend. \n\nI stumbled\
  \  upon him less than a year ago. Online. \nHe was living here, I was planning my\
  \ holiday. That\u2019s exactly why I came across him: I was looking for photos of\
  \ Bali. Pretty prosaic, right? Well, what came next was definitely less prosaic\
  \ and it\u2019s the reason why I\u2019m here today.\nWe liked each other, we kept\
  \ talking for hours without skipping a day. But of course, he left before I arrived.\
  \ \nThe first thing I didn\u2019t expect was to stay in his same room in the guesthouse\
  \ I booked for my trip. After getting there, I had a familiar feeling, as if I aleady\
  \ knew that place. I checked with him and yes, he used to live there. That\u2019\
  s when the owner of the place started treating me like family and gave me his old\
  \ room. Which was amazing, by the way.\nThe second thing I didn\u2019t expect was\
  \ to keep talking to him for months, every single day. We went along so well that\
  \ we started working together. Him, from South America, where he moved; me, from\
  \ Italy. \nI\u2019ve always worked with him without really believing that we would\
  \ have met at some point. \nI visited Bali without really believing I would have\
  \ come back a few months later.\nBut here I am, at the door of the guesthouse.\n\
  I can still smell the incense scent. I can see the bright green of the garden and\
  \ the grey of the perfectly clean cobbles taking to the pool.\n\nThen I look upwards\
  \ and he\u2019s there, smiling at me.\n\nNow it feels like home.\nAnd this is the\
  \ last thing I expected."
