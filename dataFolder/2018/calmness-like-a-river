Text: "It was around summer holidays when a decision was made to travel to a National\
  \ Park. The Jim Corbett National Park, Uttrakhand, India. Took us a day to reach\
  \ there and a nice resort along the river was selected for the stay. It was like\
  \ any other resort but there was something else that touched us other than the locale.\
  \ \n\nIt was almost serene and so peaceful during the night time that I still crave\
  \ that feeling. Never did a 3 day stay felt so short. As it was summer time, nobody\
  \ did expect it to be so chilling. As a result, I fell ill, but despite that, i\
  \ wasn\u2019t stopped from just sitting down near the lake and just hear the soothing\
  \ sound of the water running along the pebbles and rocks. That clinking sound was\
  \ ever so touching in those stary nights away from the noise and pollution of city.\
  \ It was like coming up for a fresh air. I felt positive, awakened. \n\nTill this\
  \ day, I want to be no where but at that place, where time seemed to be perfect\
  \ and to flow like the river itself. \n\nIt is said that if you ever have any trouble\
  \ during your life, take a look at how a river runs its course. Never stop, never\
  \ quit, just keep flowing and moving forward towards your goal. When I was there\
  \ with my family, that serenity was indescribable. Everything sort of fell into\
  \ place and it was like we were meant to be there, to witness that. To make it even\
  \ more perfect, there were even horses running along the river, eating grass and\
  \ just standing there, posing for us to click them. \n\nLife, was that. Living with\
  \ yourself. Coming back to home didn\u2019t feel good after an experience like that.\
  \ If I could, I would definitely visit it again."
