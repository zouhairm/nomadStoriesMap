Text: "Salento is a charming, sleepy little town in Colombia\u2019s coffee region\
  \ where life seems to move at a glacial pace. Dogs bask in patches of sunshine;\
  \ locals drink coffee in the square and tourists mill around drinking in the myriad\
  \ colours of the town\u2019s quaint architecture. \n\nWhilst the splendours of Salento\u2019\
  s architecture are plentiful and enough to keep you occupied for hours, there is\
  \ another more adventurous pastime that locals are keen to share with those passing\
  \ through their town. \n\nTejo, hailed as Colombia\u2019s national sport, involves\
  \ throwing tejos (heavy steel discs resembling paper weights) at a pit of clay containing\
  \ small envelopes of gunpowder placed around a steel ring.  Everywhere we went in\
  \ Salento we were asked if we had tried our hand at the local game. So, on our last\
  \ evening in the town, we ventured out to find the local Tejo club to find out what\
  \ all the fuss was about. The bar wasn\u2019t hard to find, it seemed that everyone\
  \ in the town was heading there too.\n\nWhen we arrived at the bar we handed over\
  \ some money in return for our discs and we were lead to a free lane by Andres,\
  \ the manager who seemed to be oblivious to the frequent blasts that reverberated\
  \ in our eardrums every time someone\u2019s disc hit the gunpowder. Tejo has been\
  \ a part of Colombian culture for centuries and according to Andres, playing your\
  \ first game of Tejo is a rite of passage for many Colombians. \n\nA friendly local\
  \ who claimed to be \u2018the best Tejo player in Salento\u2019, let us in on the\
  \ secret of a good game, \u2018drink lots of beer\u2026 and have lots of fun\u2019\
  . We were pretty sure that these weren\u2019t the official rules of the game but\
  \ we were more than grateful for his advice and thinking ourselves experts already,\
  \ we prepared to play.  \n\nTejo, it turned out, is not as easy as it looks. However,\
  \ what we lacked in skill we made up for in enthusiasm \u2013 joining in with the\
  \ locals as they cheered on the best players in the room. \n\nLeaving the bar, our\
  \ clothes embalmed with the smell of gunpowder, our hands caked in clay and our\
  \ arms aching from throwing the metal discs, we said goodbye to Andreas who nodded\
  \ his head and replied, \u2018Welcome to Colombia\u2026\u2019."
