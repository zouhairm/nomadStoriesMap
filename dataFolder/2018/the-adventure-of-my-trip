Text: "Argentina is one of the largest countries in the world and its size brings\
  \ with it diversity. The cities have a vibrant culture, while the smaller towns\
  \ have a rural authenticity. Some of the best natural wonders on the planet are\
  \ in Argentina \u2013 from Iguazu Falls in the north to the glaciers in the south.\
  \ Let\u2019s talk about history of Argentina Every morning in Buenos Aires, crowds\
  \ arrive in La Recoleta Cemetery to lay flowers at the modest brass plaque of Evita\
  \ Peron. These emotional displays that began long before Madonna played her in the\
  \ film version of Evita, or the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical became an international\
  \ hit. In fact, since the very day she died in 1952, Argentines have worshipped\
  \ Evita's memory. Her life story has all the elements of a tragic Latin fairytale.\
  \ Born Eva Duarte, the illegitimate daughter of a poor provincial family, she came\
  \ to Buenos Aires at age 15 to try her luck as a rthe passion of Tango and a literary\
  \ tradition that included the likes of Luis Borges, I had quickly fallen disillusioned\
  \ with a place I had heard deemed as the \u201CParis of Latin America.\u201D Coming\
  \ from New York\u2014where no man or woman appears the same\u2014Buenos Aires seemed\
  \ all too homogenous. While most Porte\xF1os (citizens of Buenos Aires) trace their\
  \ roots back to different parts of Western Europe, almost everyone in the city was\
  \ white. Furthermore, the people I had met didn\u2019t seem particularly fond of\
  \ Americans, a sentiment shared by much of Latin America especially during the Bush\
  \ years, and yet, Buenos Aires reminded more of America than any other Latin American\
  \ country I had been to. Men often went out to clubs dressed in shirt and tie and\
  \ flashing business cards, women armed in high heels and stylish office attire upturned\
  \ their noses as they passed by, high-culture types sat around daintily drinking\
  \ caf\xE9s con leche at outdoor corner cafes. The city seemed to be in love with\
  \ capitalism and the dance of the dollar, and eagerly trying to distance itself\
  \ from the rest of Latin America.\n\nadio actress. I heard about Peru"
