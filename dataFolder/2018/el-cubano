Text: "His features are rough but he has the kindest eyes. I can see every line of\
  \ history and culture tattooed in every single one of his expressions. And I cannot\
  \ wait for him to tell me a story.\nThe men's white smile and dark skin like the\
  \ night yell through space and time. His clothes remind me of my grandfather's back\
  \ in the day and I can almost feel the thin cloth of his white shirt in my fingers.\
  \ How worn out it looks, so perfectly covering his tall thin figure, congruous to\
  \ his ecstatic.\nGently, he pulls the horse into a concise direction as we explore\
  \ la Habana. As the sky becomes gray and commences its roaring, el Cubano stops\
  \ in a busy street with blue facade and plunges into the sea of people. After a\
  \ few minutes, he comes back with two red roses. Standing next to us, he meticulously\
  \ takes each thorn of the rose and throws it to the ground. He blows some air on\
  \ the stem as indicating perfection and hands us a rose each. I capture this beautiful\
  \ moment in my head and forever as I stare back at him and the rose.\nHours later\
  \ we go to a Caf\xE9 and I offer him a cigarette. I am so anxious to hear his story,\
  \ a story his eyes are dying to tell me.\n'So, how is it to live in Cuba?'  - I\
  \ attack while he exhales the smoke of the cigarette\nHis face paints half a smile\
  \ and he answers:\n'I love living in Cuba, but it is difficult to make a living.\
  \ And my family is gone now\u201D\n'Where are they?' - I rush to ask before he finishes\
  \ his cigarette\n'They left months ago. Many Cubans are leaving nowadays; hoping\
  \ to make it to the American coast. Next month I will be embarking on that trip\
  \ myself'\nI don't want to ask if he is afraid. He is so full of hope but I can\
  \ also sense his fear.\nOn the way back to the main Plaza and as the sun falls in\
  \ the horizon, I see his silhouette move with purpose at times. El Cubano is constantly\
  \ telling us stories even when he is quiet. \nOur last day has come and it is Sunday.\
  \ El Cubano is giving us a ride to the airport on this rather dull day. Through\
  \ the ride, we talk about our plans and the mundane, trying to fill the silence,\
  \ trying to escape the sadness. A million goodbyes later, we walk towards the main\
  \ entrance of the airport. I turn and think this is probably the last time I will\
  \ see el Cubano. His words will resonate in my mind for as long as I live, his posture\
  \ will always play back in my head and I will always hope that life, in its funny\
  \ ways, puts us in the same place at the same time so he once again can tell me\
  \ a story."
