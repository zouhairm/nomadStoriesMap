Text: "\"Need a help?\" - the voice was husky and not loud, and if i was deep in \
  \ thoughts, I might have not heard him. But he had that silent confidence and hypnotizing\
  \ black eyes, so black, that I remembered the darkest night in my life and shrugged.\
  \ He frowned and put his grand palm in the pocked.\n\u201CThat\u2019s it\u201D,\
  \ I thought, \u201Che\u2019ll take the knife, stab me to death and take all I have.\
  \ How sad that he doesn\u2019t know me, doesn\u2019t know that I\u2019m only 21\
  \ and don\u2019t have much to give, just 5 dollars and some chocolate with nuts\u201D\
  \nI closed my eyes and tried to remember if I ever told my mother that I loved her.\
  \ Next moment I felt gentle touch on my shoulder and opened my eyes.\n\u201CHere\u201D\
  \ \u2013 he was holding 20 dollars and giving it to me \u201CI guess you need it\
  \ more\u201D \nWe were standing next to Wallmart, it was nearly 3 a.m. both trembling\
  \ under cool summer wind and staring at each other.\nHis name was Mike and originally\
  \ he was from Madison but his father lost a job, so he and his family came back\
  \ to his mother\u2019s home place \u2013 Wisconsin Dells. \nFirst time it was awkward\
  \ to talk to him, somehow I felt very insecure, but after realizing his absolute\
  \ cuteness and shyness over some simple things, I found him profoundly nice person.\
  \ He also told that \u201Cfor Asian girl you are pretty perverted\u201D  and I liked\
  \ to respond that \u201Cfor black boy you are too tender\u201D. \nHe liked pink\
  \ color, vintage dresses and black-and-white romantic movies, he didn\u2019t destroy,\
  \ but crashed  all my stereotypes about black men, as former or future criminals,\
  \ loving gangsta rap and being mean and brutal.\nAmerica and people here had changed\
  \ me, made me less conscious about how do I look and sound, but care about true\
  \ feelings, taught me to see the very nature of people\u2019s soul, not their skin\
  \ color. \nI made so many awesome acquaintances, some stories had inspired me, some\
  \ made me cry and think that I\u2019m very lucky, some made me laugh so my cheeks\
  \ hurt. \nFrom that moment I became greedy \u2013 greedy of new acquaintances, new\
  \ places, new emotions, and understood that for the best self-creation you need\
  \ to see and know other selves, make a connection."
