Text: "Have you ever starred an elephant in the eyes?\n\n\u201CMahout!\u201D he yelled\
  \ at me. \n\nOr been close enough to one that you realize that the sharp black hairs\
  \ on their heads make them look like a character in a Shel Silverstein book?\n\n\
  \u201CMahout!\u201D\n\nOr had an erect elephant penis swinging so close to your\
  \ face that you fear being slapped by it on accident. Something that you are sure\
  \ would hurt if it happened?\n\nHave you ever been so in love with an elephant that\
  \ you would give up everything in order to stay there with him. \n\nMahout. It\u2019\
  s the term in South and Southeast Asia for an elephant caregiver. The person who\
  \ rides, feeds, and tends to these fascinating creatures who are more family than\
  \ pets. It\u2019s also the nickname that Mr. Lee gave me on my first day, as I bent\
  \ down to touch the stomach of a pregnant elephant. \n\n\u201CYou no go home. You\
  \ stay here. Be Mahout!\u201D\n\nMahout. It\u2019s the name I would respond to for\
  \ the next three days. I would hear it while we cut the sugar cane. \u201CMahout,\
  \ come try,\u201D Mr. Lee shouted as he took a bite of a bee hive. I would hear\
  \ it right before dinner. \u201CMahout, time to clean,\u201D as he hands me a rake\
  \ and points at the massive piles of elephant poop that I would later step on to\
  \ turn into paper. I would hear it as he hands me the leash. \u201CMahout, you walk\
  \ elephant.\u201D\n\nI would hear it in my heart as the elephant turned his head\
  \ and leaned into my hand. Mahout. \n\nI grew up in the Silicon Valley. A place\
  \ where every house has a working AC unit and you are never more than ten minutes\
  \ from a cafe with internet and overpriced coffee. At Mr. Lee\u2019s Elephant Sanctuary,\
  \ there are five fans and two cold showers. The local store carries the essentials\
  \ and some interesting little knick knacks that know their place on the shelf. There\
  \ is no internet, no television, and minimal electricity in the entire town. But\
  \ I want to live there. \nI wanted to live there with this elephant that trusted\
  \ me enough to rest his head inside my palm. I wanted mahout to be more than just\
  \ a nickname. I wanted it to be my life; and I knew it could never be but I couldn\u2019\
  t help but wonder what if. What if I gave it all up to stay here with him?\n\nMahout.\
  \ A fantasy of what could have been. A memory of that moment where I held this elephants\
  \ head. And now, because of the tattoo I put on my wrist, it will always be a part\
  \ of me. My elephant stays with me, resting in my arms, and reminding me of what\
  \ I would give up everything to be. Mahout."
