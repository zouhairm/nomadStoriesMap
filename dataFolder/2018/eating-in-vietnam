Text: "I\u2019ve been waved into a Vietnamese kitchen and then been told that kitchens\
  \ are cleaned but once a year. I have written the name of an herbal medicine that\
  \ will, and I\u2019m quoting an authority here, \u201CLine your gut so the bad bacteria\
  \ doesn\u2019t get absorbed but everything else flows out.\u201D In other words,\
  \ I\u2019ve had to imagine the workings of an anal luge while eating pork bits served\
  \ at room temperature.\n\nI now know that Vietnam is a country where no street food\
  \ is consumed without worry, no fart is without risk, and where you become grateful\
  \ for the ubiquity of the spray hose bidet.\n\nI\u2019ve eaten conch grilled in\
  \ an alley and bathed in downy butter sauce, sipped a clam juice and lemongrass\
  \ broth and declared it the finest thing I\u2019ve ever tasted. I\u2019ve seen the\
  \ night sea\u2019s horizon alight to lure fish. I\u2019ve walked under trees bountiful\
  \ with the green rounds of coconuts and tumorous shapes of durians. I\u2019ve shared\
  \ city roads with fowls that strut, picking at the refuse that\u2019s everywhere.\n\
  \nI\u2019ve learned that a meal in Vietnam displays the country\u2019s poetry, poverty,\
  \ and richness. It\u2019s a country that has utilized seemingly all of its acreage\
  \ to feed itself: it\u2019s carved up its hills, flooded its flat plains, laid netting\
  \ into its rivers and seas. Every aspect of a food\u2019s life is on display: growth\
  \ to transportation, bartering and sale, preparation and ingestion, all in front\
  \ of you, block after block.\n__\n\nVu is a broad-smiling man. After a job loss,\
  \ he turned his street food obsession into a guide job. We\u2019ve been nibbling:\
  \ grilled scallops on their scorching shells, poached chicken and slivered banana\
  \ blossoms tossed with briny vinegar. Now we\u2019ve cigar rolled banh xeo (\u201C\
  Vietnamese pancake\u201D if anglicized) with lettuce.\n\nI say, \u201CI sense that\
  \ everyone works with food.\u201D\n\nHe chuckles and explains: The food industry\
  \ is a rudimentary safety net. Poverty chronic. The surest path towards a meager\
  \ income is to buy a burner, portable gas canister, some dishes, and find a street\
  \ corner. And cooking must be seen because freshness is so important. Vietnamese\
  \ will not eat where they cannot see the food made.\n\nHe dips a bite in a rosy\
  \ vinegar, \u201COur lives are in our food. In my village, where we had food scarcity,\
  \ my mother cooked with too much chili so people would not steal. She made us cry!\
  \ Yet that chili is emotion. There is bitterness, there is sourness, there is pain\
  \ from heat, but there is also sweet. This is the goal of Vietnamese food: to have\
  \ all the emotions of life in one bite.\u201D"
