Text: "My heart stopped, I was finally here! I had finally made it. The fresh breeze\
  \ brushed through my face and hair and I knew that moment that coming to Italy was\
  \ the best decision I had made for myself.\nMy friends and family members thought\
  \ I was crazy. However that wasn\u2019t the case, I always wanted to travel and\
  \ had always wanted to go to Italy and this was the perfect reason. I\u2019m a 23\
  \ year old girl who recently found out that my whole life had been a lie. I was\
  \ adopted at a very young age and had no idea up until I found my old adoption papers\
  \ in my dad\u2019s office. \nI had always felt out of place but couldn\u2019t really\
  \ put my finger on it. I had this longing inside of me that would never go away\
  \ and now all of this makes sense. I needed to find my real parents who happen to\
  \ live in Italy. My adopted parents gave me all the information I needed for me\
  \ to find them in Italy. \nAs I got to Italy I felt anxious, would they want to\
  \ meet me? Would they like the person I had become? Everything started ringing in\
  \ my mind so I decided to take a tour of Italy just to get my mind off this huge\
  \ step I would be taking in my life. As I was walking around a wave of pizza base\
  \ filled the air and I knew I had to try their pizza out.\n\nI sat at a cute little\
  \ corner that had sweet music playing in the background and just took everything\
  \ in. A few moments had passed and a beautiful middle aged Italian lady who had\
  \ beautiful long black hair and brown eyes with a looked like she carried the world\
  \ on her shoulders asked if she could sit next to me as it was her favourite spot.\
  \ I agreed and we sat quietly eating pizza after a while we began chatting and laughing\
  \ as if we had known each other forever. After the nice chat I knew that it was\
  \ time that I started looking for my birth mom.\nI stood up and we said our goodbyes,\
  \ as I was about to walk out of the shop I turned around and said \u2018\u2019Oh,\
  \ I forgot to ask you what your name was.\u2019\u2019 she turned around and said\
  \ \u2018\u2019 My name is Aurora\u2019\u2019. Questions ran through my head, my\
  \ mom had told me that my birth mothers name was Aurora, Aurora Russo!\n\nI walked\
  \ to hear slowly and told her that I was looking for Aurora Russo. She smiled at\
  \ me puzzled and said \u2018\u2019Yes that\u2019s me\u2019\u2019. \nThat\u2019s\
  \ when the words rushed out of my mouth \u2018\u2019I\u2019m your daughter!\u2019\
  \u2019\n\nTears rolled down my eyes while her beautiful face fell flat to the ground\
  \ . I couldn\u2019t believe that the lady I was having a conversation with who I\
  \ felt so connected to is actually my mom!\n\n\u2018\u2019This was the last thing\
  \ I expected!\u2019\u2019"
