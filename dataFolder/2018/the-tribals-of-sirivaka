Text: "Sirivaka is a remote tribal village, unapproachable by road, in the Papikondalu\
  \ mountain range on the banks of River Godavari in the South Indian state of Andhra\
  \ Pradesh. The people living here are the Koya tribals, an indigenous community\
  \ who have been discriminated and oppressed by the mainland Indian society and forced\
  \ them to the margins across the centuries. The tribals in this village, along with\
  \ two lakh more tribals in the vicinity, are going to lose their homes, villages\
  \ and forests because of a massive multi-purpose irrigation project called as Polavaram\
  \ project. Just last week, I went to this village along with a few others to report\
  \ about the dispossession and displacement that is happening in rural India in the\
  \ name of development. \n\nThe kind of love the tribals have showered on me left\
  \ me speechless. Here is a journalist, who is meeting them for the first time, but\
  \ that didn't stop them from giving me some delicious porcupine and palm toddy,\
  \ a form of alcohol. I am feeling extremely guilty because they are sharing their\
  \ food, drink and space with me and all of this without any expectations. The fact\
  \ that their village will be a thing of the past if the Polavaram project becomes\
  \ a reality hasn't stopped them from enjoying their daily life. Ofcourse, there\
  \ is a sense of fear and sadness that they will have to leave the village they are\
  \ born and raised up, but the happy faces take precedence to the sad emotions. \n\
  \nThe men and the women drink together, which is hard to find in other rural communities\
  \ in India, where a man drinks while the woman serves him food. The openness about\
  \ sexuality in the tribals took me by surprise.  They seem to be ahead of the modern\
  \ society in more ways than one, but are still called pre-modern just because capitalism\
  \ hasn't yet engulfed them as they largely live in a subsistence economy with hardly\
  \ any use of money or cash. \n\nThe tribals started living here ever since River\
  \ Godavari is born. They get their food and drink from the forests around. They\
  \ also have their own natural medicine made from various trees in the forest. In\
  \ the two days I spent with them, I enjoyed every bit of their culture and food.\
  \ These people are some of the most affectionate people I have come across in my\
  \ life. It is really unfortunate that they are being drowned in the name of development\
  \ and even more unfortunate is the fact that I couldn't do anything about these\
  \ wonderful people. I had moist eyes when I am leaving the village."
