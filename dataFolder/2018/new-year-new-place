Text: "We had been drinking all night and the caffeine and alcohol mixed sweetly in\
  \ my stomach. I couldn\u2019t sleep for that one hour I gave myself before the sunrise.\
  \ It was a local tradition and I decided to try it for the first time. \n\nWe rolled\
  \ out of bed before the sun broke, I ran with the group down to the snowy beach\
  \ to see the first rays of sun hitting the water. Gyeongpo Beach was swelled with\
  \ people wanting to see the first sunrise of the year.  Looking down the beach Koreans\
  \ were sitting on heavy blankets snacking on copious amounts of Kimchi, fermented\
  \ spicy cabbage. It was not my ideal breakfast but my stomach growled regardless.\
  \ I had forgotten to grab some food on my way out of my apartment. \n\nThe energy\
  \ was moving from person to person. I looked over to my friends Karen and Kate,\
  \ we snapped a quick \u2018selfie\u2019 and then looked again as the sun was rising\
  \ quickly. It peeked out from under the clouds in the distance and then the crowd\
  \ went wild. Everyone stood up and cheered and then fell silent. It was a new year\
  \ and new possibilities. My toes were frozen and the waves to my left crashed over\
  \ and over again. Flow and ebb, the everlasting reminder that nothing stays the\
  \ same but then all things are connected to a cycle. Then the hangover stuck and\
  \ I had to sit down for a moment. Puking on a beach on Jan 1 was not going to become\
  \ an omen for the year to come. My stomach settled and I looked over at crowds moving\
  \ as the sun rose, they were just as cold as I was and ready to go home back to\
  \ a warm bed. I was hungry the whole walk back and thought of kimchi and my mouth\
  \ watered as I fell into bed and into sleep."
