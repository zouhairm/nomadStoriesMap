Text: "The stone temples stood tall, like monasteries in cities of trees. They watched\
  \ over me as I climbed their fallen brethren; tiny in comparison. A fear of the\
  \ cliff edge invigorated me; my fingers felt the grooves in the rocks, finding places\
  \ of friction. The features here had a life of their own. They had a heat to their\
  \ bodies and a texture to their skin.\n\nTheir lives are so different, that, in\
  \ some way, they become incomparable to a civilised world.\n\nLooking around at\
  \ the mountain ranges and seeing no sign of human inhabitation gave a lightness\
  \ that can be felt nowhere else.  My steps took me across the Scabby Mountain Range\
  \ in the east of Australia. \n\nMy muscles pumped as I climbed a crevice in the\
  \ rock to reveal an open plateau, the spring plants recovering from their winter\
  \ covering of snow. The green shoots provided home to a plethora of life. \n\nWhen\
  \ walking in Australia it is common to hear kangaroos in dense vegetation or the\
  \ rustle of leaves as highland rodents climb in crevices in the rock. I was taken\
  \ aback to stare down into two eyes very unlike my own. The small dragon sun-baked\
  \ with no fear.  A trusting soul, different to myself in so many ways but innately\
  \ we shared a lot of connections. He watched as my friend walked blissfully by and\
  \ turned his head back to stare up at me. \n\nWe locked eyes as I edged closer,\
  \ squatting down to see him better. I recognised this as an experience I would remember\
  \ for many years, just a fleeting moment in time. I moved closer still and, to my\
  \ surprise he remained as transfixed with me as I was with him. A civilised chat,\
  \ with no judgement or fear. 'What brings you here?' He may ask. Or perhaps he would\
  \ comment, 'It\u2019s a lovely warm day!'.\n\nThe customs of the creatures here\
  \ are different to those that we see around our concrete jungles. In the remote\
  \ bush where there are no tracks and very few people ever attempt to reach, some\
  \ animals are trusting, even interested in what we have to say. \n\nThe natural\
  \ world is no different to the human world. Stereotypes are rife, some are broken\
  \ down, and others are built up, but ultimately a traveller is constantly surprised\
  \ by the nature and customs of those around them. \n\nI glanced away, taking in\
  \ again the proximity of sheer cliffs, features momentarily forgotten. The flutter\
  \ of fear and respect returned along with a unique concentration. \n\nI breathed\
  \ in the mountain air to the depths of my lungs and continued on my trip, another\
  \ moment in time locked away in my memory."
