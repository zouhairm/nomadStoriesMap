Text: "I didn\u2019t speak Spanish, so I could only assume the Peruvians promising\
  \ to guide us across the Ecuador border were being helpful. \nMy travel buddy, who\
  \ did speak Spanish, appeared to be getting on famously with our escorts\u2014so\
  \ I smiled stupidly in the back of the car, a hapless, mute tagalong, trying my\
  \ damndest to keep several obvious red flags at bay.\nFor one, no official had looked\
  \ at my bus ticket when we departed the beach town of Mancora. Our \u201Cbus\u201D\
  \ was not even a bus, but a van\u2014again, odd. That van had parked near the border;\
  \ we then were shunted into this car of chatty locals, who would take us the rest\
  \ of the way.\n\"Don't get in cars with strange men\" is basically the foundational\
  \ rule for all female travelers--right? Yet I, the mute, stayed alarmed and silent\
  \ amidst the foreign chatter. \nOur driver warned of \u201Cmuchos problemas\u201D\
  \ at the passport office. \n\u201CProtests,\u201D my friend translated. \u201CTwo\
  \ girls from California got held up for DAYS here last week!\u201D \nProperly spooked,\
  \ we did as we were told: kept our heads down, got our stamps, rushed back to the\
  \ car.\nIt wasn\u2019t until our drivers coaxed us out of the car to walk across\
  \ a crowded marketplace that jig of helpfulness was officially up. Every sidestepped\
  \ red flag coalesced into a blinding tapestry\u2014one that screamed, \u201CTHESE\
  \ MEN ARE CROOKS.\u201D Or worse. If this was a trap, my gut hadn\u2019t failed,\
  \ but it had proven less persuasive than my language barrier.\nThe men, to their\
  \ credit, did not kill us. Instead, charged us--99 USD apiece for their guidance\
  \ through all that (nonexistent) conflict at the border. A steal!\nWe had cash.\
  \ We were lucky, and we knew it. Still, we were without a ride. A passing driver\
  \ had pity on the palpable neediness of two dazed gringos who'd clearly been bested,\
  \ selling us floor space on a no-vacancy Orme\xF1o bus. And so, sunken among discarded\
  \ wrappers and rolling soda bottles, we made our way back. \nYou go to Peru expecting\
  \ souvenir stories of Cusco\u2019s high-altitude charm; teeming llamas; that first\
  \ glimpse of Machu Picchu, the one that reminds you that some things cannot be over-hyped.\
  \ You get all that, but you might also get this: an object lesson in trusting your\
  \ gut via a ride on the floor of a dirty bus, 99 dollars poorer than you were an\
  \ hour ago, tired but grateful because it could have been so much worse, laughing\
  \ despite yourself because you're alive, you're on the floor of a bus, and the whole\
  \ thing, when you think about it, is kind of funny.\nThe second story is the one\
  \ you tell."
