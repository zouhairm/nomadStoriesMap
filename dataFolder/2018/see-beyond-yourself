Text: "Tunisia isn't so far from Sicily, the place where I've spent much of my youth.\
  \ My first stop was Sidi Bou Said. White houses with blue windows and doors were\
  \ spread all over the city. One of the men selling curcuma on the main street explained\
  \ me that blue keeps the mosquitoes away and white keeps the temperature lower inside\
  \ the houses. Every human being finds a proper solution to survive, I thought. The\
  \ city center was packed with people, mostly children playing around. And then I\
  \ saw a woman dressed in white who was sitting on the sidewalk. It seemed she noticed\
  \ me before I did. So I got closer and she smiled sincerely.\n\n\"Where are you\
  \ from?\".\n\"I'm Italian\".\n\"Are you sure?\".\n\"Well, I'm pretty sure I know\
  \ where I was born!\".\n\"That's not the point\".\n\nShe got up and her blue eyes\
  \ looked right at me.\n\"I have blue eyes, like so many others in Tunisia. I guess\
  \ you didn't expect that. I was born here, but I don't know if all my ancestors\
  \ were Tunisian. Maybe, maybe not. Do I care? I know I'm Tunisian, but I'm more\
  \ than my birthplace\".\n\"Sorry, I don't understand\".\n\"You told me you're italian.\
  \ But I look at you and you don't look Italian at all\".\n\"I still don't understand\"\
  .\n\"Everything can be something else than what it seems. Learn to see beyond yourself\"\
  .\n\nShe left me there, with a lot of questions to answer. I tried to forget our\
  \ strange conversation to be honest and I went on my way. Tunisia was a constant\
  \ discovery. With each passing day, my bond with this country grew stronger, because\
  \ this place showed me how similar Tunisia and my birthplace are, without boundaries.\
  \ They both smell of herbs and spices, they both deal with drought in summer, they\
  \ both live like time stopped. Nobody is in a hurry in Tunisia. I still remember\
  \ these white figures walking softly, smiling, ignoring the prying eyes of tourists.\
  \ They were there, and I was there too. In a foreign country, yet so close to my\
  \ home. \n\nI saw other cities like Tunisi, Tebourba, Bizerte, Kalibia but I understood\
  \ what the woman meant only on the last day of my trip. I was on the bus and I thought:\
  \ \"there aren't blue skies like this anywhere else in the world\". It reminded\
  \ me of her eyes, her words. Nationality and appearance don't matter. What really\
  \ matters is to realize that people are more than what they look like and more than\
  \ the place they come from. I was so blind that I had to wait for this trip to improve\
  \ myself. A real blessing. Thank you, Halima. Your words treated my blindness."
