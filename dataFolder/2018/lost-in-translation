Text: "The rhythmic sound of clapsticks and the didgeridoo makes the hot air pulsate.\
  \ Around me, Yolngu women painted in ochre prepare for their bunggul, a ceremonial\
  \ dance. A group of men have just finished theirs and stand barefoot and bare-chested\
  \ in the sand, leaning on long spears.\n\nI make my way across the dusty oval to\
  \ where a group of young boys are kicking a footy. Unlike their parents, they are\
  \ dressed in sports singlets; mostly Aussie Rules and NBA, but one is rocking a\
  \ Tupac muscle tee. Even in Arnhem Land, 600 kilometres east of Darwin, Tupac lives.\n\
  \nThe boys speak Yolngu Matha, a language I\u2019ve been trying to learn and the\
  \ reason I am here. Nervously, I test the waters with an introduction. \u201CNgarra\
  \ Alex, nha nhe yaku?\u201D This causes some excitement and the boys crowd around,\
  \ grinning broadly \u2013 it\u2019s not often they hear a balanda (white person)\
  \ \u2018talking language\u2019.\n\nThey start firing questions at me. How do I know\
  \ Yolngu? Where am I from? Do I know his father? I don\u2019t. I explain that the\
  \ only locals I do know are my language teachers, but halfway through I forget the\
  \ Yolngu word for \u2018know\u2019. Is it \u2018marnggi\u2019, or \u2018marrnggitj\u2019\
  ? I go with marrnggitj but this provokes such a reaction that I stop speaking. The\
  \ boys are looking at me wide-eyed. \u201CMarrnggitj\u201D? they ask, incredulously.\
  \ I nod, although not with any confidence. They form a huddle around the football,\
  \ now lying forgotten, and whisper excitedly while I wait, bemused.\n\nFinally one\
  \ steps forward and gestures for me to go back. I walk a few steps away. Further,\
  \ he indicates. I walk a few more. He\u2019s finally satisfied and I watch while\
  \ he leans to the boy next to him, hand carefully covering his mouth, and whispers,\
  \ in the easily audible way that children do, \u201CAlex\u201D. \u201CYes\u201D\
  , I reply. This causes giggling. Further back, the boy indicates, and I walk back\
  \ further. Again he leans to his friend; the whisper is fainter this time, but still\
  \ perceptible, \u201CAlex\u201D. I reply again, and the laughter continues.\n\n\
  They want me further back so I move, 15, then 20 meters away. The whispers are finally\
  \ inaudible, but the body language tells me when to respond. The boys are in awe\
  \ and it\u2019s now clear that this is some kind of test for paranormal hearing,\
  \ but I have no idea why.\n\nEventually I take my leave, shooting glances over my\
  \ shoulder at the boy who is still whispering my name. Once out of sight, I dig\
  \ out my well-worn Yolngu dictionary and flick to M. There it is, marnggi, \u201C\
  know\u201D and underneath, marrnggitj, \u201Csorcerer\u201D."
