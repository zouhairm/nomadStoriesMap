Text: "I opened my eyes and in the first seconds,I couldn't realise where I am.The\
  \ clouds were floating quickly in the porthole window.I slowly regained consciousness.I\
  \ had a bad dream.It was a nightmare, a terrible memory from my past.Small muslim\
  \ clergyman with disgusting short beard was spelling the words from the Holy Scripture\
  \ Quran.He uttered them too loudly,beyond measure.My father was holding my legs.But\
  \ he is the one who decided to expose me to this.Clergyman came closer to my face\
  \ grabbed my neck and began to strangle me.In a daze,Icouldnt move Icouldnt believe\
  \ that it was happening with me.They were looking for the devil inside of me.The\
  \ dream ended with the hands of my father holding my legs turned into chains like\
  \ the hands of a man on my neck I struggled until at some point I turned into a\
  \ bird. \nBeautiful bird.They were looking for a something demonic inside of me,through\
  \ this exorcist stuff.Because of my aspiration for travelling, because of my desire\
  \ to be free.Perhaps,after this event it has become for me an edge and I made a\
  \ final decision.The decision not to tie myself up with chains and to fight for\
  \ the freedom.My father saw in my ambition to know the world something horrible.A\
  \ girl living in Central Asia in a muslim family can't expect more than a life in\
  \ parent's house.I always have been feeling the world differently.My heart is still\
  \ filled with trembling at the sight of mountains,lakes and forests.Who are we?Where\
  \ did we come from?And where are we going?Who can answer?Nowadays,man is not born\
  \ fully free.All of us dependon something.Whether,its money or fanatically-radical\
  \ parents or social networks.I have not fully understood myself but I know for sure\
  \ that I would like to be able to travel a lot.The world is so big and I'm so small.Such\
  \ thoughts were floating in my head when we landed atthe airport in Milan.People\
  \ around us couldn't not to notice how our eyes were shining.Me and my friend Aigerim\
  \ were on our way to Turin,the first capital of Italy.During the flight,we were\
  \ laughing and looking down with curiosity from the window.However,it is ok that\
  \ in a few days we will probably stay in the street without place to sleep.But later,the\
  \ fate has shown us a miracle,at the most difficult moment we met \"Cavalerizza\"\
  .One of the oldest buildings in Turin,where horse races had previously been held\
  \ at the Royal court.The most free of morals people live there:artists,writers,circus\
  \ actors,their purpose is to protect the building from demolition."
