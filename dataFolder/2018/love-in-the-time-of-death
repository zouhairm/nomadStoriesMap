Text: "I am Sister Peggy\u2019s shadow. I follow her to Copapayo, a town in the campo.\
  \ Peggy, with her snow-white hair and burnt-pink skin, will give a speech to commemorate\
  \ the wartime massacre that took place on the same ground on which we now stand.\
  \ I look at the earth below my feet, and, to my surprise, it\u2019s not soaked with\
  \ 25-year-old blood. Women set up tables of tamales. Teenage boys make fun of me.\
  \ Hundreds of people laugh like it\u2019s any other day. \n \nA man approaches Peggy\
  \ and whispers a request. She gives me the leash to her dog Luna, who has matching\
  \ white hair. We follow her as she follows the man.\n  \nI\u2019m sure that Peggy\
  \ will soon become my mentor. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve come to this country after\
  \ all\u2014to learn from her how to do great good.\n\nWe cram ourselves in a windowless\
  \ one-room house with about 10 other people. In a bed against the wall, a man\u2019\
  s head is on the pillow, disembodied. Or so it first appears\u2014his emaciated\
  \ form is all but invisible under the blanket. I am sure this man is dead until\
  \ his head moves ever so slightly.\n \nI am witnessing death\u2019s threshold for\
  \ the first time. Its sickly sweet humidity stops my breath. I wonder how a man\
  \ could be so between two worlds and still manage to be alive. I feel a fear, an\
  \ aversion even, of death.\n\nThe floor is dirt. The air is stale. He needs proper\
  \ care\u2014sanitary conditions, electricity, plumbing\u2014 immediately.\n \nInstead,\
  \ Peggy leans over the man, strokes his forehead, prays. She becomes much gentler,\
  \ much softer, than the Peggy I\u2019ve known. She was here for the war. She knows\
  \ what to do in the face of unbearable things.\n\nBut I\u2019m not ready for it.\
  \ I was looking for death in the earth, and have found it in the air. I want to\
  \ run away.\n  \nPeggy gives the man a kiss and demands that he give her one, too.\
  \ As we leave, he crosses his arms over his chest like he knows.\n\nThis is how\
  \ death is supposed to look, not like the killings we\u2019re here to remember,\
  \ Peggy says in her speech. My alarm turns to shame. I\u2019ve always thought a\
  \ natural death is best, yet when faced with it, I want to flee.\n\nAs Peggy sips\
  \ a Suprema cerveza and drives us back down the rocky road, I wonder if what I saw\
  \ is better than the sterile death of an American, plugged into machines in a white\
  \ room, family members holding on, not letting go. \n\nThe man is cared for on his\
  \ journey, not forced to stay. He faces no guns or bombs. Not even a syringe. He\
  \ didn\u2019t notice the American girl quivering by the door, clutching a leash.\
  \ \n\nThe man\u2019s name is Don Juan."
