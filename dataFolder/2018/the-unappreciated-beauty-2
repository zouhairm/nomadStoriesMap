Text: "Having done my research prior to the trip, I had an idea of what the place\
  \ might resemble. Waking up at the crack of dawn, I had made sure to book the tour\
  \ with the most convenient time to go visit the floating markets of Mekong Delta\
  \ in Vietnam. I did not want to miss the opportunity to experience the bustling\
  \ atmosphere, the colourful fresh produce or the chance to buy some of it at a bargain\
  \ price. \nWith the sun on the horizon, I approached Thuy, my local guide, and we\
  \ made our way to the docks where the Can Tho boats were anchored. The captain was\
  \ introduced as Nhung, who did not speak English, but smiled sincerely and me made\
  \ me comfortable enough not to worry about the boat size or the deep waters of the\
  \ river ahead.\nAs we made our way towards the markets of Cai Rang, I was told of\
  \ their history, taking an instant interest of my surroundings and the peacefulness\
  \ it granted. Looking around to enjoy a bit of the scenery, I noticed something\
  \ floating on the banks. I immediately asked to find out, as the sun made it hard\
  \ to recognize. I was not, however, prepared for the answer.\nRubbish. Alongside\
  \ both edges of the river, for as long as we were floating was mixed waste in significant\
  \ amounts. I naturally did not understand how it got there or by whom. As I kept\
  \ wondering and debating in my head, I heard a scratching sound coming from the\
  \ long-tailed outboard motor. For a minute, I thought it had broke and we would\
  \ have to paddle back. \nI quickly turned to Thuy for an explanation when I caught\
  \ a sight of what Nhung was doing at the back of the boat. Due to the motor being\
  \ 180 degrees rotatable, I was now seeing the propeller out of the water and in\
  \ her hands as she tried to cut up the plastic bag it caught on in the river. \n\
  The last thing I expected was for her to throw the plastic she untangled from the\
  \ fan back into the river. \u2018\u2019I keep telling her every time that we have\
  \ a bin here on the boat, but all she does is wave me off with her hand,\u2019\u2019\
  \ Thuy said apologetically. \nI could not help to wonder why she would not want\
  \ to prevent this from happening to others. How they might face the same issue with\
  \ the same plastic bag and she did not really mind. Not to mention, how this delicate\
  \ natural habitat was being spoiled piece by piece with every action of this type.\n\
  In the end I realized that the locals are not to be judged nor blamed for their\
  \ ways. They were unable to travel and see in order to appreciate the things that\
  \ they have, yet take for granted."
