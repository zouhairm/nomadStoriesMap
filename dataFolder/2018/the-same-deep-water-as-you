Text: "Love of country, local traditions and culture, love of people around you. There\
  \ are a lot of persons and there aren\u2019t barriers for communication, friendship\
  \ and eternal love. Distance? There are conditional borders, which, like the borders\
  \ of countries, exist only on the map and in our heads, but not in our heart. Usually\
  \ we attach great importance to these conventions. How they can inspire fear of\
  \ people and limit the flight of fantasy, ability to see and feel this world. \n\
  \nSuch boundaries were also in my head. It's hard to understand, but fate prepares\
  \ for you not only trials, but also prepares surprises, fate rises you. My doubts\
  \ melted after my first independent trip to Spain, when I understood that there\
  \ were no borders, that people understood me. I saw that they want to communicate\
  \ with me.\n\nIn one day about 4000 km between Spain and Russia dissolved once and\
  \ for all. I comes back again and again, because I knew that my friends from Brazil,\
  \ China, Netherlands, USA, Germany, Mongolia and Australia wait me. Where could\
  \ I meet all these guys? Each person had own life, own way and\u2026 own love of\
  \ Spain.\n\nAmazingly, how different people with diverse cultures find each other.\
  \ I can compare people from around the world with non-compatible products. They\
  \ shouldn\u2019t be in the same plate, but the chef decided to do experiment in\
  \ the world kitchen and got new dishes. In our case, there are new pairs. I know\
  \ 4 new incompatible tastes (love stories) and one of them is mine.\n\n1. Italian\
  \ spaghetti and Spanish sangria.\nLove Italian guy and Spanish guy who met in Germany.\
  \ In order to understand each other, they took a little break. One of them decided\
  \ to go to learn the language in Spain and then returned to his soul mate.\n\n2.\
  \ Lamb soup and \xABtapas\xBB\nAsia and Spain have been together 5 years. She doesn\u2019\
  t want to leave her native country (Mongolia). He he doubted whether, but nevertheless\
  \ they are together, despite the distance and visa regime.\n\n3. Grilled kangaroo\
  \ and tortilla \nSociable husband (Spain) and his wife (Australia) are used to living\
  \ in movement. One day they decided to go on a journey around the world and then\
  \ they\u2019ve never been apart. Now they live in Barcelona, but probably soon will\
  \ hit the road.\n\n4. Galician octopus and Russian red caviar.\nGalicia is a small\
  \ region of Spain at the end of Europe. Moscow is the capital of a large country\
  \ with strong character. They cross paths on Spanish territory, but soon they met\
  \ again in snowy Russia. To be continued\u2026"
