Text: "Hello\nI am Pranita from Nagpur(Maharashtra).\nI have travelled alot along\
  \ with my parents but like every youngster i wish to visit leh laddhak through some\
  \ motivation all the way from my state through bike. But going alone n exploring\
  \ beautiful place wasn't a good idea. I started asking my friends to accompany me\
  \ but most of them weren't seem to be interested. One day me and one of my friend\
  \ were talking casually and he exclaimed that he wish to go on a vacation somewhere\
  \ and here i was already up with the plan of leh. i excitedly said why not Leh?\
  \ He loved the idea and then and there he started collecting information. We planned\
  \ to go by train as per convenient to our budget and i wishing to ride by  bike\
  \ was left aside sadly. And as we were in search of the people who could join us\
  \ for this plan, and as i was worried of the funds whether i ll be able to manage\
  \ or not because i did not want to ask from my parents and as working for a part\
  \ time job, still i was not able to manage. I was praying and struggling hard that\
  \ some or the other magic should happen either in the increment of the salary or\
  \ some one could just lend me some amount. Suddenly After few days my friend rang\
  \ me up and said that he has asked one of his friend to accompany us and his friend\
  \ said yes to it but also gave a surprise that his uncle works in some well known\
  \ company of India at a very good position and he is ready to sponsor us (including\
  \ the expenses of halting,expenditure of bike etc)  only if we ll be riding all\
  \ the way from Nagpur to Leh Laddhak by bike. And listening to this i was a bit\
  \ shocked, surprised , excited and got really happy that the magic that i have been\
  \ expecting like literally came true. Like my dream came true. Now i dont have to\
  \ bother about the expenses nor i ll need to trouble my parents for this. Now i\
  \ ll be travelling to Leh Laddhak this June and feel the beauty, the peace of it\
  \ and share with people the experience and motivate them to atleast visit once and\
  \ explore the beauty of the nature. After this incident i came to know that if u\
  \ believe in yourself and determine to accomplish your goal, nothing can stop you\
  \ to achieve it. If you work hard n struggle for that goal everything is just possible\
  \ even univerese serves you at its best. Because i have been working really really\
  \ hard for it and i got it. I feel like i have achieved a victory and yes ofcourse\
  \ i have ! One just need to have love for their passion.   \nThank you."
