Text: "Our existence on this planet interconnects with everyone and everything by\
  \ weaving our stories together into one cosmic web.  Our truth is hidden within\
  \ the cosmic web as a soft whisper from the divine, only heard in stillness.  It\u2019\
  s spoken as the synapse that ignites the divinity within us to evolve as humans.\
  \ I made this connection when I had the privilege to train with a Mayan Shaman in\
  \ Belize for a whole month. I will say it was a once in a lifetime opportunity that\
  \ I will never forget  what I learned.  Our medicine comes from the great spirit\
  \ in many forms as a reflection of what we truly need to usher in harmony into our\
  \ lives. In the Mayan tradition we will explore the fierce Balam  and snake medicine\
  \ as we intermingle with them in the cosmic web as healing energy.\nBalam is the\
  \ mayan word for jaguar, a sacred animal in their culture as the ruler of the underworld.\
  \  Everyday they rise in the east as the sun god and set in the west as the ruler\
  \ of the underworld.  Finding darkness in your heart to bring forth light is the\
  \ jaguar medicine. And guiding you to conquer your fears or your enemies with integrity,\
  \ never to abuse your power in the process. In order to speak your truth you have\
  \ to be honest with yourself to become a fearless warrior.  Jaguar medicine will\
  \ speak to you when you are ready to explore the depths of your soul.  Someday our\
  \ character become a reflection of a jaguars power, ferocity, and valor with integrity.\n\
  When you are ready to explore the depths of your soul, you are ready to shed the\
  \ layers like a snake.  Before you shed the layers you have to be bitten a few times\
  \ by a snake to transmute all poisons of  your psyche. The symbolism of the snake\
  \ shedding it\u2019s layers is cosmic consciousness because you are willing to experience\
  \ anything regardless of how many times you taste the poison. With right state of\
  \ mind you are able to transform and be reborn again in divine energy. By accepting\
  \ all aspects of our lives we realize that we are souls having human experiences.\
  \ \nRebirth begins when we have the courage to conquer our fears. In reality our\
  \ fears are mental, physical, and emotional bites from a snake. They are the poison\
  \ that welcomes in the healing process and connects us with the great spirit. While\
  \ in Belize with the Mayan shaman I was able to conquer my fears and shed my layers\
  \ in order to walk in divine light and connect with  the universal cosmic web. \
  \ I hope you will too!"
