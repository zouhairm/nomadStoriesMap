Text: "\u201CYou should behave like an animal,\u201D said Alberto. \n   \u201CYour\
  \ train comes by and you have decision to make. You jump or you don\u2019t. And\
  \ if you don\u2019t it may take a long time before another train comes by.\u201D\
  \LThere I was, at the end of an impeccable journey backpacking across central America,\
  \ in a quirky artist\u2019s studio in Miami in deep resonance with what I was hearing.\
  \ What got me there was precisely that, jumping, heeding an Intuitive train going\
  \ his way. I had been travelling for weeks and on my way back to Montreal, I decided\
  \ to spend a day in Miami in transit. It was nice day. I treated myself to a nice\
  \ meal and a glass of wine, had a huge $10 delicious ice cream, attempted shopping,\
  \ died rather quickly and sat down to kill time at a Parisian caf\xE9 not far from\
  \ Alberto\u2019s. I thought it was an expensive afternoon after all, also quite\
  \ unnecessary and I wondered, the way I do about what brought me there. I payed\
  \ my bill at the cafe and went on walking. I thought I would visit the beach for\
  \ sunset and before heading back to the airport. I had just enough time for that.\
  \ Walking, I was pulled by what looked like an antique store on the other side of\
  \ the street but my cynical, pedantic self kept me walking. \L  \u201CWhat if?\u201D\
  \ the rest of me asked, \u201CHow often do you get to be in Miami?\u201D\LI crossed\
  \ over and found an aged Yogi in white basking in the afternoon sun with shades\
  \ on. I couldn\u2019t make up what the space was. The cramped antiques, it turned\
  \ out, made up his furniture passed on to him by several friends leaving the city.\
  \ \L\u201CThis is an art gallery. Modern left, Mystical to the right\u201D. I stepped\
  \ into the left room.  Nothing engaged me yet I extended my time feigning depth.\
  \ Remembering I had nothing to prove I walked out and into the mystical and was\
  \ completely enlivened by these colourful paintings of erotic buddhas in action\
  \ and absorbed as I was in contemplation of my latest discovery, Alberto\u2019s\
  \ chaining questions commanded my attention and he sat me down, poured me what was\
  \ left of his wine and on we went discussing math, the cosmos,  quantum mechanics\
  \ and self-esteem. Vanessa a \u2018Peruvian princess\u2019 my age walked in as she\
  \ decided to pay old Alberto a visit instead of the gym and next came Alex, a mafioso\
  \ looking nurse with a few beers in hand.\n\u201CWalking the path is timeless\u201D\
  \ said Alex, \u201Cbut one step left or right off the path is like an eternity.\u201D\
  \ \n   \u201CI learned this from Alberto.\u201D \LMy heart smiled. I had an undisclosed\
  \ appointment in Miami and I made it."
