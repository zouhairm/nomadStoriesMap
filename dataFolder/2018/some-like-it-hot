Text: "I find it peculiar the spiciest food is found in the hottest climates. Millions\
  \ under the tropical sun knowingly, frequently, eat the fruits of the Capsicum plant,\
  \ of which minimal ingestion induces a severe burning sensation. \n\nMy ideal conduit\
  \ of spice are Indian dishes, and my desire to have an authentic taste brought me\
  \ to the organized chaos of Kolkata. Upon arrival, mirages dancing off the tarmac,\
  \ my eagerness was slightly dampened at the mid-day high, but an afternoon being\
  \ conditioned to the noise and sheer number of people didn\u2019t upset my enthusiasm\
  \ for a meal. \n\nMerely a window wide opening in a wall, the place I chose had,\
  \ despite its size, complete lack of signage or seating area, a steady stream of\
  \ patronage. I observed one such transaction discreetly; a business man, tie loose\
  \ with briefcase and jacket slung across his sweat plastered back, ordered and ate\
  \ while the stall keeper, leaning haphazardly out his window, chatted animatedly.\
  \ \n\nI had not a single Bengali phrase to my name, so stepping up gestured I wanted\
  \ the same. The heat emanating from the now visible kitchen behind the little window\
  \ would have reduced me to a puddle had I lingered, so taking my tray of curried\
  \ potatoes and vegetables and puffy bread, \u201CPav Bhaji!\u201D the only explanation\
  \ offered, I stood to the side. \n\nThe first cautionary mouthful was absolutely\
  \ delicious, and I set into the bread to aid the transfer of curry, tongue already\
  \ pleasantly tingling. I was just the odd tourist happily mingling with locals when\
  \ the sun exploded in my mouth. \n\nWhen I think back, I can still feel the almost\
  \ imperceptible crunch that instantly told me I should not have bitten down. In\
  \ the moment, all I knew was my tongue, cheeks, and lips were melting and swelling\
  \ at the same time, and it hurt. It hurt a lot. \n\nThe tears start to bead when\
  \ my eyes lock with the stall keeper. Could he sense my pain? I pivot away, and\
  \ the tears fall as I realize my pride won\u2019t let me spit out the raging inferno.\n\
  \nI swallow.\n\nPhysical implausibility stops me from ripping out my throat as a\
  \ fiery track to hell burned its way to my stomach. I am so close to screaming into\
  \ the sky, and I\u2019m sure a tongue of flame would have immortalized me as the\
  \ only tourist to have turned into charcoal after eating a single hot pepper on\
  \ her first day in India. \n\nBut I don\u2019t.\n\nInstead, I causally shove the\
  \ rest of the bread into my mouth, hand back the tray with a teary smile, and sprint\
  \ to the nearest stall selling ice cream."
