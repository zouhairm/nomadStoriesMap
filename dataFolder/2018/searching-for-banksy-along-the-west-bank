Text: "Two planes, three bus rides and a whole lot of nail-biting later, there I was,\
  \ trekking into Bethlehem like a figure from the days of old. The aroma of desert\
  \ dunes filling my nostrils. Beads of sweat inspired from the heat as well as trepidation\
  \ about my plans slowly trickling down my brow and hiding in my beard, like a surreptitious\
  \ syrup. I was lost along the Israel and Palestine border. I had a swashbuckling\
  \ fantasy of coming to see just what it was like. Now the time to summon the chutzpah\
  \ was nigh and despite the blazing rays of the orange orb above I was developing\
  \ cold feet. I was a few paces away from turning back before I saw a sign telling\
  \ me I had arrived shimmering in the sandy golden distance.\n I entered the crossover\
  \ checkpoint, a squat concrete facility with multiple booths and turnstiles. I was\
  \ greeted by two hulking agents who looked like they would paint me green, dip me\
  \ in a vat of grease and dub me nothing but a fried pickle without any qualms. I\
  \ told them I was there to see the Walled-Off Hotel, a nearby exhibit being put\
  \ on by the artist Banksy. When I said his name, their curt demeanor did an about-face\
  \ and they theatrically waved me through. Welcome to Palestine. According to a number\
  \ of creeds, I was home.\n          A gentle giant approached me.\n \"Hello my friend,\
  \ I am Ahmad. I drive taxi here. Would you like a tour?\"\n        Triple rainbows\
  \ and Siberian snow-leopard sightings occur more often than me accepting unsolicited\
  \ propositions off the street, but something about him seemed like he was offering\
  \ me a tour for my benefit rather than his own financial gain. I decided to enlist\
  \ his services. We visited the birthplace of Jesus first while he poured out his\
  \ heart.\n \"My brother, we just want to be free. We want to live and take care\
  \ of our family, but we have no control over our lives. We are trapped, my brother.\"\
  \n We turned the corner and lo and behold- not the hotel- but the barrier itself;\
  \ a grotesque symbol of segregation and hostility. Is this situation fulfilling\
  \ a prophecy foretold; or will this zeitgeist become a cautionary parable in a future\
  \ holy text? I'm not sure what a wayward wise man would have done, but in the end,\
  \ I gave him what I could. I was driven by fantasy and confronted with reality,\
  \ led by a spray-painting Picasso into a geopolitical nightmare of Orwellian proportion.\
  \ Maybe someday it will dawn on this crazy world that all roads and seas and the\
  \ people who depend on them are one. Godspeed, Ahmad."
