Text: "Thinking about the uttermost interesting element of traveling, if by train,\
  \ car or plane, many might say, that it would be the precision and practice a pilot\
  \ needs to steer the plane, or the fascination of being in the air and seeing a\
  \ sea of clouds below. \nFor quite a while I have found myself in that state. As\
  \ a child nothing would be more delightful than getting the window seat and looking\
  \ out onto the world for hours. Now don't get me wrong, it still is an amazing feeling,\
  \ but nowadays a fascination of mine has become the profiling of fellow passengers.\
  \ While one of them might be on the way home from an exciting trip abroad, another\
  \ is on the way to meet family, and the next has been traveling back and fourth\
  \ between jobs and conferences. So while everyone has their own individual travel\
  \ destination, at one moment everyone is on the plane, everyone is in one room for\
  \ a finite amount of time, and everyone is equal, sitting and waiting for the next\
  \ stop, a time of fueling up before the hustle. Whenever I find myself in such a\
  \ place the thought of this diversity is extremely beautiful to me. \nOn some of\
  \ my latest travels I have gradually tried to move from a passive bystander to engaging\
  \ with my fellow travelers and surprise myself. By coincidence I had met a German\
  \ couple, who were on their way to Miami for their vacation and who had to take\
  \ the next connecting flight with me - one that would leave within the hour of us\
  \ getting in at Madrid airport. The next 10 minutes we found ourselves running as\
  \ if we were partaking in the Olympics. And while it was absolutely exhausting I\
  \ felt myself being overwhelmingly happy, because as we ran along and dodged our\
  \ way between people and suitcases, we cheered each other on on the way and told\
  \ us with certainty that we would make it. Another flight I met a charming French\
  \ girl, who also was on her way to Medell\xEDn to celebrate the new year. Together\
  \ we bonded over going through customs, finding the way about the airport and although\
  \ we had just met, she already invited me to stay with her, if I would not find\
  \ my friends at the airport. \nThe hush and commotion of travel can scare many,\
  \ but if you start to focus on those around you, the good things that happen everywhere,\
  \ you can discover so many hidden stories and meet new amazing friends. So close\
  \ your eyes, lean your head on the window and let it all come your way.  \nThe kindness\
  \ of a stranger never fails to amaze and is the most surprising thing to ever experience."
