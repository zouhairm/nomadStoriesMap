Text: "Having obsessed over J-Pop as a teen and collected Sanrio stuff with my babysitting\
  \ money, I'm going to visit the motherland of Kawaii: Tokyo!\n\nWe strolled from\
  \ our Shinjuku hotel through the park, lined with cherry blossoms, to the Meiji-Jingu\
  \ Shrine. The Shrine was surrounded by tall trees, and despite the hordes of tourists\
  \ it had a real sense of peace.  I will discover that this is a Japanese trait,\
  \ to find calm in the most crowded scenarios.  \n\nWe then headed to Takeshita Street,\
  \ best known for it's Lolita Goths aka The Harajuku Girls. The whole street smelled\
  \ like burnt sugar, with candy shops and ice cream parlours. There were shops reminiscent\
  \ of 1990's goth culture, filled with corsets, lace gloves and black & white striped\
  \ petticoats; a worthy wardrobe for an extra in a Tim Burton film.\n\nWe make our\
  \ way to Shibuya crossing, famous for being the busiest intersection in the world.\
  \  100s of people cross the street in every direction.  What is fascinating is how\
  \ zen it all feels.  You'd think with all those people it would feel like perpetual\
  \ rush hour; the last thing I expected was to find peace and calm at Shibuya Crossing.\n\
  \nWe hailed a taxi from Shibuya in the rain, there was a crazy array of neon signage\
  \ stacked from basement bars to the top of skyscrapers, with cocktail lounges, hairdressers,\
  \ dentists, dog groomers, wedding shops...  I never saw a rainy night look so bright!\
  \  We pass through Tokyo's red light district alongside trendy arcades & themed\
  \ bars. We are headed to Shinjuku; generally this feels like the cool bit for nightlife.\n\
  \nThe Robot Restaurant in Shinjuku was our next stop.  This place is totally devised\
  \ for tourists, I did not see a single Japanese patron there... but it's completely\
  \ amazing and as a tourist it ticked the #Kawaii box!  Upon arrival we were entertained\
  \ by a band who were people dressed as robots doing bossa nova covers of familiar\
  \ hits. \n\nWe are ushered into the venue with bleacher style seating and an optional\
  \ bento box. The show starts with two drum cores, one representing the ancients\
  \ with kimonos and kabuki style masks with long beards; the other representing the\
  \ future, girls with rainbow wigs and colourful outfits. They were having a drum-off!\
  \  There's a rough plot involving robots and women fighting (underwater, with pandas,\
  \ dressed as majorettes), but it's not a coherent story.\n\nI may have only been\
  \ in Tokyo for a day, but I can not liken this experience to anything; you just\
  \ have to see it to believe it."
