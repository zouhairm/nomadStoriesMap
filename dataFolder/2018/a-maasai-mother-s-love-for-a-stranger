Text: "In 2014 I was lucky enough to travel to Tanzania for a 3-month volunteer placement\
  \ in the sleepy coastal town of Tanga, in the country's north. Myself and other\
  \ volunteers from around the world worked together at the village primary school\
  \ to renovate the old classrooms and build a much needed toilet block for the students.\
  \ I made many friends here and met some truely inspirational people; the level of\
  \ hardwork and dedication shown by the local tradesmen is still something I aspire\
  \ to achieve in my own life. However, there is one standout experience that humbled\
  \ me the most. \nAfter working at Ndarkwai Wildlife Ranch for two weeks, we were\
  \ informed we would be allowed to visit a nearby Maasai village the following day.\
  \ With Kilimanjaro rising tall in the background, seven Englishmen and six Australians\
  \ nervously walked through the dusty front gate of village, not knowing what to\
  \ expect. We were greeted by cheeky kids with massive grins and hugged by very tall\
  \ people in bright colourful clothing. As anyone who has visited Tanzania will know,\
  \ being out in sun for more than five minutes will leave you with quite a thirst.\
  \ So, I pulled out my massive two-litre, charcoal filtered drinkbottle and when\
  \ the kids started crowding around and holding their hands out, I filled them up\
  \ thinking how funny it was. One of the mothers came up to me and took my hand,\
  \ leading me back to her house. I sat in the corner while she proudly introduced\
  \ me to each of her three children, two little boys and a brand new baby girl. Although\
  \ I am not the best with children, this woman let me hold her baby and I thanked\
  \ the universe I didn't make the poor girl cry! As I got up to leave her home, she\
  \ stopped me. She proceeded to take one of the beaded necklaces from around her\
  \ neck and put it over mine.  \nThere are a lot of awful things in the world, but\
  \ the kindness and generosity of this woman reminds me there are just as many good\
  \ things out there. She welcomed me into her home for such a small thing as to take\
  \ a few seconds to entertain her little boy for a moment. As cliched as this moment\
  \ is, I do still believe it is a story worth sharing."
