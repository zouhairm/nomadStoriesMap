Text: "When I first decided to visit Bhutan, I was looking forward to meeting the\
  \ polite, hospitable people. Also the fact that it is the only country in the world\
  \ which measures its progress on the Nation Gross Happiness Scale (makes me fall\
  \ in love with this country all over again). I did not anticipate, however, that\
  \ there is something else which makes Bhutan very different and weird for people\
  \ who do not understand the culture: A penis painted on EVERY building; from houses\
  \ to immigration offices.\nOne day I asked my driver, Choni, about this and he told\
  \ me that painting an ejaculating penis on walls is linked to a 15th century monk\
  \ named Drukpa Kunley who, as the legend goes, slayed a demon called Dochu La and\
  \ trapped his soul within a Chorten (Bhutanese chapel) called Chimi Lakhang.\nHeroic\
  \ as Drukpa Kunley was, he was also known as the mad saint or the divine madman\
  \ because of his unorthodox ways of teaching Buddhism through singing, humor, and\
  \ outrageous behavior that amounted to being bizarre, shocking, and with sexual\
  \ overtones. \nAnother story I heard from the locals is that one day Drukpa Kunley\
  \ was invited for a thread ceremony, where the monks were to be adorned with the\
  \ blessed thread. The eccentric Kunley requested for the thread to be tied around\
  \ his penis instead, stating that if anything required a blessing, it was his phallus.\n\
  After hearing these stories, I decided to visit the divine madman\u2019s lair. I\
  \ asked Choni to drive me to Chimi Lakhang, located in the Punakha district. It\u2019\
  s perched atop a hill and I had to hike for a good part of it, but I didn\u2019\
  t mind it, since the route passes through beautiful paddy fields.\nThe Chorten itself\
  \ is a simple building and I was disappointed, because I expected it to be a grand\
  \ edifice with bling matching the madman\u2019s persona, it was none of that. Inside\
  \ the chorten, however, is a repository of all the phalluses that Kunley apparently\
  \ collected and brought back from Tibet.\nLocals and Buddhists from as far as Japan\
  \ come here to pay their respects. Childless women come here to pray for children,\
  \ or new mothers bring their infants to be blessed by the divine madman who is represented\
  \ by a huge wooden phallus.\nThe divine phallus is sacred in Bhutan and getting\
  \ married at puberty and having kids immediately is the way of life here. It is\
  \ not just cultural, it is almost divine, to be able to procreate. \nSo the next\
  \ time you are in Bhutan, do not get offended if someone directly asks you how many\
  \ kids you have."
