Text: "Sharp pain radiated down my back. No food nor drink could I consume. For 25\
  \ years sailing the world, I had been a healthy and active woman. My diagnosis was\
  \ gallstones; a sonogram showed 38 gallstones in my gall bladder with 2 blocking\
  \ the bile duct. Surgery was recommended but I resisted. I would try natural ways\
  \ by drinking tea and sipping olive oil.              \n   My husband and I were\
  \ aboard our boat anchored near Cancun. When the meager supply of painkillers ran\
  \ out, I went to an acupuncturist. She recommended I go to the psychic surgeon in\
  \ the middle of the Yucatan.\n   I had witnessed psychic surgery in the Philippines\
  \ 12 years before in a small whitewashed room by a young doctor who operated on\
  \ a friend. I stood on one side of a cot where she lay; the doctor , on the other\
  \ side. When he blessed himself, his eyes rolled upward showing only the whites\
  \ of his eyes. Gently, his hands sketched a line on her stomach and he peeled back\
  \ layers of skin exposing her organs. He plunged his hands inside her up to his\
  \ wrists. When he took them out and shook them, the blood vanished. With a swish\
  \ of his hand he closed her up; no scars were visible. \n   Now I was ready for\
  \ psychic surgery. I boarded a bus for the 5 hour trip. I was dropped off at a rustic\
  \ village at dusk.  At a nearby cafe, a woman offered me a room and explained how\
  \ to see the doctor.\n   At 4 a.m. I joined others walking the dusty path to the\
  \ operating hut. For a few pesos, I purchased the required hen's egg. It was to\
  \ be held in my hand and given to the doctor for a diagnosis.\n   The doctor and\
  \ his helpers arrived in an old Cadillac. They were dressed in white with necklaces\
  \ of gold. They summoned us to line up.  When my turn came, the doctor cracked the\
  \ egg and said,\"2 gallstones in the bile duct. Come back at 8 for surgery.\"\n\
  \   Promptly at 8 a.m. I was ushered with 10 others into the hut. Cots were separated\
  \ by plastic shower curtains hanging down from the rafters. When the doctor came\
  \ to me prone on the cot, he scratched an shallow X with a crystal and then put\
  \ his hand into my body.  I called out in pain. He said,\" It is done, gone now.\"\
  \  The pain stopped and has never returned. I still have my gall bladder.\n   If\
  \ I ever have a physical ailment again, I will take the option of psychic surgery.\
  \ Miraculously, it works. The villagers all believe as the doctor does that he has\
  \ been given this gift by God."
