Text: "Lunch was a sweaty, sticky, fly-laden affair. A storm would be coming in, we\
  \ were promised by the old lady who had cooked. Communication was a challenge in\
  \ this place where English was a luxury. As were toilet paper, Internet access,\
  \ and non spicy curry. \n\nWe did not need too much language though; our oohs and\
  \ aahs sufficed to rave to our host about the spectacular meal we had just had.\
  \ A rice and curry classic, where coconut had been king, picked fresh a few hours\
  \ before. The children had run out the back door, ahead of me, barefoot and nimble\
  \ across the rice field, knocked a few bright orange ones off the tree and sliced\
  \ the top parts off. One for them, one for me, cheers, and we had drunk the coconut\
  \ water out. They had then chopped open the receptacles and we had scraped the white\
  \ meat inside.\n \nRich, plump, and sweet. Exquisite. The rest would be pressed\
  \ into oil and milk. Those went into the simmering pot, under which dry coconut\
  \ was lit. Coconut shavings were tossed in for seasoning. There was rice, mellum,\
  \ some roti. We ate together, well, with our hands.\n\nFive hungry strangers shared\
  \ a home cooked meal that cost less than a dollar a head,\n\nBohoma stutiyi. Thank\
  \ you.\n\nOur host beamed with pride, and I was in love with Sri Lanka.\n\nAn abundance\
  \ of juice: papaya, mango, watermelon, avocado, coconut and passion fruit. Apples\
  \ are a delicacy here while exotic fruits grow on trees. Children and monkeys climb\
  \ those and laugh, dangling upside down from skinny legs.\n\nSkinny legs, skinny\
  \ arms. Skinny cows, rare in the fields. Their meat is just as rare, and expensive.\
  \ Dairy is more sustainable. Milk and yogurt can be drawn daily, stored in fridges\
  \ where fridges exist. Where they do not milk is stirred into tea, powdered, and\
  \ children chase colored carts for ice cream.\n\nThe Sri Lankan life is one of hard\
  \ work by day and evenings flying kites on the shore. Collarbones protruding, but\
  \ hands clapping, voices singing over the sound of stomachs grumbling.\n\nColorful\
  \ saris washed by hand in the river, backs bent into curves over time. Hard feet\
  \ and soft hearts, hard times and warm welcomes. Wrinkles earned with smiles and\
  \ sun.\n\nHere, in this village whose name has too many vowels for me to pronounce,\
  \ happiness is a small house, small kitchen, two pots and a happy, shared lunch.\n\
  \nThe old lady was right; a few clouds in the sky. A small breeze had already picked\
  \ up. It tousled the eleven-year old\u2019s silky black hair. There would be rain\
  \ that night."
