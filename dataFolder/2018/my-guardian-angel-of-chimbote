Text: "I realized I\u2019d lost my camera about the time the burlap sack at my feet\
  \ started squirming. Startled, I looked down and noticed that it was, in fact, a\
  \ chicken in a bag, the drawstring cinched loosely around its neck. I reached for\
  \ my camera and\u2014it was gone. My mouth began to resemble the bone-dry Andean\
  \ foothills outside the bus window as I realized six weeks of travel photos had\
  \ vanished. So I did the only thing I could at that time: I called Oscar.\n\nOscar\
  \ was not like the other men in Chimbote. In the macho world of central Peru, he\
  \ stood out like a sore, bedazzled thumb, especially when accompanied by two gringos\
  \ with teetering backpacks. And for a good reason: He sashayed through the streets\
  \ in his own hand-stitched, vibrant patterns.\n\nI had met Oscar after an accidental\
  \ bus disembarkment. The travel book did not have much to say about Chimbote, and\
  \ we misjudged a stop and found ourselves well off the beaten path in a dark corner\
  \ of the city. Oscar and his mom befriended us as we stood on the sidewalk with\
  \ our noses in the travel guide. \u201CYou look like you need help,\u201D he told\
  \ us in broken English.\n\nWe bantered back and forth in traveler\u2019s pidgin\
  \ until I successfully communicated our plans to catch the bus to Huaraz the following\
  \ day. With a discerning nod, he promised to take care of us, hailed a cab, and\
  \ shepherded us into the back seat. The knowing look on his mother\u2019s face suggested\
  \ this was not at all out of the ordinary.\n\nOscar set us up at a hostel a few\
  \ blocks from his house. He invited us into his home and took us out for Chinese\
  \ food. The next morning, he escorted us to the bus station and saw us off. With\
  \ a hug and a wave, I thought that was the last I\u2019d see of Oscar.\n\nWhen I\
  \ called him a few hours later, I explained that I\u2019d misplaced my camera and\
  \ that I recalled having it at the hostel that morning. The two men at the hostel\
  \ gave me the runaround when I\u2019d called them earlier\u2014would Oscar mind\
  \ asking about it? The next day, he calmly informed me that the hostel did have\
  \ my camera. He\u2019d reclaimed it, of course.\n\nOscar was waiting for me with\
  \ my camera in tow when I arrived at the bus station in Chimbote a few days later.\
  \ He had not only procured the camera but had also paid off the hostel workers and\
  \ wouldn\u2019t accept my reimbursement. For good measure, he insisted I stay that\
  \ night with his family.\n\nI realized then that Oscar had taught me a valuable\
  \ lesson: Mistakes can birth adventures, and sometimes a missed bus stop yields\
  \ a friend."
