Text: "The first time we traveled to Mexico I was about to turn 13. I had lived my\
  \ whole life in Argentina, where I was born. My dad was a musician, he used to go\
  \ on tour all the time, from Germany to Spain, from Israel to Peru and the United\
  \ States, he traveled a lot. He took us with him every time he could, so traveling\
  \ was always a important part of our lives. Sometimes the trips could last up to\
  \ 3 months! We used to spend our holidays in places like Brazil, Uruguay, by the\
  \ sea, in different cities of Argentina, Paraguay, etc... We even missed the first\
  \ day of school once!\n\nI can remember vividly the conversation my mom and dad\
  \ had with us (Nico, my 1 year younger brother and me). They started by saying that\
  \ things were getting rough in Argentina, that even though my dad was an amazing\
  \ guitar player, he wasn't making enough money. I remember their worried faces,\
  \ wondering what we were going to answer to their question: \"would you like to\
  \ go to Mexico? We are thinking of living there for a while\". My brother and I\
  \ answered \"Yes!\" immediately. We loved (and still do) our country but we were\
  \ aware of how much our parents were struggling. \n\n6 moths went by after that\
  \ conversation and we were finally ready to leave our home country and travel to\
  \ Mexico! It was difficult saying goodbye to our family and friends, we were pre-teens!\
  \ That's when your friends mean absolutely EVERYTHING, but we were also excited,\
  \ we had never gone that far.\n\nWe arrived in Mexico and a beautiful Mexican family\
  \ let us stay with them. We literally got to live in a \"vecindad\", like the one\
  \ in \"El Chavo del 8\"! \nEverything was so different, the food, the way they talked,\
  \ even how they behaved!\nI turned 13 a month after our arrival, and when you are\
  \ 13 you don't want to stand out too much, but we did, we talked \"funny\", we had\
  \ different games. But the sweetest thing happened, most of the people thought that\
  \ our differences were cool and interesting! We learned that candy can be spicy,\
  \ that an \"albur\" is giving everything a dirty meaning, that a dish that you have\
  \ never tasted before can become your favorite (hello chilaquiles!), but the last\
  \ thing I expected happened, we learned that living abroad can make you feel like\
  \ your heart is torn in 2, you will always miss someone, a place, something, but\
  \ it also means that you love and are loved in many places.\n\nI have traveled a\
  \ lot since then, lived in different cities, but I will always remember those first\
  \ years, when I fell in love with Mexico."
