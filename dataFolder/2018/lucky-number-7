  \u201COh my god, did somebody steal our stuff? Who would steal another camper\u2019\
  s stuff?!\u201D\n\u201CSeriously, this can\u2019t be the right site. The tent\u2019\
  s neon green; how could we miss it?\u201D\n\u201CWell, where could it possibly go?!\u201D\
  \n\u201CYou think one of the bears ripped it down? Remember, the host said a black\
  \ bear recently messed with the laundry line.\u201D\n\nAt an elevation of 6,600\
  \ feet, Tower Falls is one of the first come, first served campgrounds in Yellowstone\
  \ National Park. It regularly fills up by 6:30am. We were fortunate enough to have\
  \ had our pick of sites earlier that morning\u2014we chose \"Lucky Number 7.\"\n\
  \nKris and I threw open the doors to my royal blue Toyota Celica, the headlights\
  \ illuminating the foggy, empty gravel site. The July snow storm had turned to rain\
  \ and it was drizzling now, the windshield wipers squeaking rhythmically behind\
  \ us. We inched to the brink of the campsite and peered over. There it was! Our\
  \ tent was a third of the way down a bouldery and forested cliff. I was relieved\
  \ we had spotted it, thankfully not in the churning stream below. Yet the hissing\
  \ white noise of the water\u2019s powerful movement amplified my persisting anxiety\
  \ about the unknown condition of our tent. What overcame me then was profound embarrassment.\
  \ We had underestimated Yellowstone National Park. We had underestimated Mother\
  \ Nature! Yes, the Park website had warned of strong storms, but we never imagined\
  \ that our sturdy, name-brand tent, with its eight deep stakes, and our cumbersome\
  \ gear could be completely overturned and relocated. \n\n\u201CWe saw it blowin\u2019\
  \ away as the storm started pickin\u2019 up. We were able to right it at least,\
  \ so hopefully your stuff isn\u2019t soaked.\u201D\n \nWe thanked this scruffy camp\
  \ neighbor profusely as he helped us carry our misshapen tent back to the site.\
  \ He returned to the popping campfire, wine and late-night snacks of his friends\u2019\
  \ pristine and homey site. Meanwhile, we trudged through muddy suction and tall\
  \ brush, seeking out the AWOL stainless steel stakes with the inadequate, narrow\
  \ beams of our headlamps.\n\nAs we wriggled into our puffy sleeping bags that first\
  \ night, chilled to the bone despite our textbook layering, ice weighing down our\
  \ tent and winds picking up to a howl, I thought again about how our puny gear was\
  \ no match for all-powerful Mother Nature and her whims. I was humbled and honored\
  \ to be in her presence.\n\nAnd before drifting off, I made a mental note to buy\
  \ four more stakes at the camp store."
