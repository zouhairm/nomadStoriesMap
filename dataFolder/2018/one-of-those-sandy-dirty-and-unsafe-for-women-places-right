Text: "The sun warmed up my back as my body moved up, down and all over the place.\
  \ It was like I was going in every direction, all at the same time. I look down\
  \ at my camel who is looking straight ahead following the others. I look around\
  \ all around. Sand, sand and more sand. The incredible beauty of the Sahara. I had\
  \ been on a camel before, years ago in Egypt but I\u2019m sure the ride wasn't as\
  \ long as this. Thinking back to my time in Egypt, I was unprepared and lacking\
  \ knowledge about the country. I expected a utopia of ancient and cutting edge like\
  \ you would when you think of Dubai. Not this time I told myself as I was booking\
  \ my trip to Morocco, this time I will have the lowest expectations. I expected\
  \ Morocco to be similar to Egypt. After all that's the only African country I've\
  \ experienced. The countries of Europe have a familiarity to each other so the naivety\
  \ of me assumed the same for Africa.\n\nThe Sahara shone like tiny little diamonds\
  \ just like the joy sparkled in my eyes. I climbed off the camel after reaching\
  \ the desert camp, laughing with the others as we mentioned how sore the ride had\
  \ made us. The camp was simple but relaxing which all of us had been looking forward\
  \ to. After scrambling up the highest sand dune and watching the beautiful sunset\
  \ with my fellow tour friends, a sense of calm washed over me.  We scrambled back\
  \ down as the day turned into night and the stars slowly came out to play. Stepping\
  \ out from the light of our camp, I gazed upwards grinning, loving the opportunity\
  \ of seeing this star filled sky again. Taking night photos and enjoying the company\
  \ of new friends was enough to kick the naivety from me and see Africa in a new\
  \ light. I knew this would be the highlight of my two week adventure.\n\nThe country\
  \ came out to greet me like an old friend. It shared it history, its love and its\
  \ passion for adventure. I experienced so many amazing things from camel riding\
  \ in the Sahara, feeding monkeys in the Atlas Mountains, exploring the old Roman\
  \ ruins of Volubilius, to seeing the many mosques, mausoleums and ancient buildings\
  \ that have been built. Taking the time to take in the smells, tastes and to get\
  \ lost in the maze of streets in the city medinas. It might be overwhelming at times\
  \ but if you don\u2019t do something out of your comfort zone, where will your amazing\
  \ life stories come from?\n\nMorocco, one of those sandy, dirty and unsafe for women\
  \ places right? My answer to this question is hell no. The real question is why\
  \ haven\u2019t you been yet?"
