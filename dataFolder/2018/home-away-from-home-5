Text: "I was barely 7 years old. The air was thick with the scent of jasmine and incense.\
  \ I clutched a meagre 100 rupees in my tiny palm. With one last look at my home,\
  \ I turned my back on all that I\u2019d ever known. In South India, elders say that\
  \ a mole under one\u2019s foot means they will travel far and wide. I was too impatient\
  \ to rely on my mole. One minute I was packing a bag. The next, I was a long way\
  \ from home \u2013or so I thought. \nStreets and signs of decreasing familiarity\
  \ passed me by. My tired little legs trudged along untarred streets under the glare\
  \ of a relentless sun in peak summer. Bangalore, Karnataka.  The sun got stronger\
  \ every year; its heat mitigated by more trees than I gave this \u201Cgarden city\u201D\
  \ credit for. Tiny shops decorated with garish coloured lights selling attractive\
  \ ware beckoned. Seedy Kannada pop numbers bombarded passers-by. The smell of fresh\
  \ and rotting produce alike from the local market invaded my nostrils. \nSome would\
  \ say I was too young to philosophise on the unfamiliar. But I knew I was a stranger\
  \ to my own city. If I stayed home, \u2018safe\u2019 as I was, I would always remain\
  \ one. My mother would panic if she knew what I\u2019d done. I felt a twinge of\
  \ guilt. I\u2019d only ever walked along the streets with my parents. It was an\
  \ excercise that always felt restricted, like we only stepped out of the house if\
  \ there was something to be accomplished. On my own, I\u2019d seen people: with\
  \ clothes different from those I was used to, from lungis and fluorescent lehengas\
  \ to trousers and plain pastel burqas, speaking languages I hadn\u2019t heard often:\
  \ Urdu, Konkani, Malayalam. I was overwhelmed \u2013feeling more unprepared than\
  \ scared.\nA dog trotted over to me. I yelped, pressing my back against the wall\
  \ of a mosque painted white and green. The dog barely spared me a glance as it went\
  \ on its way. I was puzzled; I thought dogs would attack me if I walked alone. I\
  \ felt more confident now. I was fine by myself. A passing woman asked me what I\
  \ was doing all alone. \n\u201CTravelling.\u201D\nShe laughed, asking me if she\
  \ could call my mother. Hesitantly, I gave her the number. \nIn less than 10 minutes,\
  \ my mother came to pick me up, shaking in anger and relief. She shoved me unceremoniously\
  \ into the car. It seems I had merely gone about 4 blocks away from home. She scolded\
  \ me the whole way back. I looked out the window in silence at the visual cacophony.\
  \ For a few surreal hours, I\u2019d been part of that canvas. My first sojourn into\
  \ the world of travel ended thus. It would not be my last."
