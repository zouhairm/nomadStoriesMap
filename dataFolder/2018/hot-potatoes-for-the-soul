Text: "It\u2019s nightime. I'm cold, wet and hungry. I can no longer make out the\
  \ lake i've been following all day.\_I\u2019ve never been here before, I\u2019ll\
  \ probably never pass by again, and at this particular moment, I don\u2019t even\
  \ know why I came here at all. \n\nThe rain falls in an incessant deluge, as it\
  \ has been doing for the last 2 hours. I have resigned myself to it. Droplets fall\
  \ from my sodden \u201Cwaterproof\u201D jacket, dripping downwards\_to the puddle\
  \ which has formed around my feet.\n\nThe cars speed past, splashing my already\
  \ soaked body. I am so tired now I don't even flinch. I'm numb, mentally and physically.\
  \ I just stand, staring at the darkness, shivering, wondering what to do next. It\u2019\
  s one of those moments when I think to myself \u201Cwhat the hell am I doing? Why\
  \ am I putting myself through this?\u201D.\n\nSo what can I do? I'm standing next\
  \ to a road, outside one of a million small shops...in Armenia. I have to try and\
  \ find somewhere to sleep or put my tent.\n\nA car stops and 2 young men glance\
  \ at me in surprise, before entering the shop. Soon after they reappear with the\
  \ shopkeeper. One of them approaches me.\n\n\"Where you sleep?\" He asks me in his\
  \ in broken English.\n\nI shrug slightly, and vaguely wave my hand around in the\
  \ air.\n\"Tent?\" I tell him, smiling and laughing as I lift my head to the falling\
  \ rain.\n\nThen, as if it's the most natural thing in the world, he shakes his head.\
  \ \"Come\".\_\n\nHe and his friend beckon me along a dark path\_towards a building\
  \ site behind the shop. The shopkeeper smiles and waves me onwards, perhaps thinking\
  \ I am uncertain about the intentions of these two unknown strangers. But\_I have\
  \ no fear.\_I leave my muddy puddle and follow...\n\nThrough the gloom a warm yellow\
  \ light emanates outwards, and I am ushered inside a half-built house. The floor\
  \ is rough concrete, but the roof is an incredible maze of artistic woodwork, circling\
  \ and tapering towards the centre of the ceiling.\_A burning log stove casts a welcoming\
  \ heat, and gathered around it are 3 more young men holding steaming potatoes.\_\
  A large wooden table stands nearby with\_4 glasses and a half empty bottle of clear\
  \ liquid. At the back of the room are 4 beds covered in blankets.\_\n\n\"Tonight\
  \ sleep here. First eat\" says the young man from outside.\n\nGlasses are filled,\
  \ the stove door opens and crisp, blackened baked potatoes emerge, passed around\
  \ to each member of the group.\_All my worries melt away, as 5 pairs of eyes look\
  \ at me. Huge smiles plaster their faces as we raise our glasses and celebrate life."
