Text: "The first travel of my life\n              I had exactly ten years when my\
  \ parents let me and my eighteen-years-old sister travel by our own.\nIt was December\
  \ of 2009 when some of my uncles asked my parents to let us travel during a weekend\
  \ with them to a city called Cara\xEDbas in the state of Bahia. My parents agreed,\
  \ and for the first time I was going to experiment the feeling of freedom, of leaving\
  \ home and at the same time,of missing everything.\n               I was a child\
  \ extremely curious, speaker and fantasized all situations. In the moment that I\
  \ get in my uncle\u2019s car I had the feeling that I was going to meet the sea,\
  \ and that  maybe I would  see some dolphins and who knows , learn how to swim.\n\
  It took about four hours to get to the place. On the road we needed to cross a float\
  \ river, I saw some colorful fishes and some fishermen throwing some nets in the\
  \ water. With a genuine children\u2019s eyes I was watching all of this situations\
  \ and smiled, I was discovering the world from the most incredible and innocent\
  \ way that somebody can feel and see.\n               When we arrive in the hotel,\
  \ right in the beginning there was a white stair and I got excited to go up as I\
  \ wanted in that moment to hold that spark of freedom in my hands. I ran the long\
  \ hall of the hotel with dark wooden doors toward the window; I got close and put\
  \ my little arms out of the window and leaned my head, at the same moment my fantasy\
  \ fell apart, I blinked my eyes four times and didn\u2019t realize that I wasn\u2019\
  t seeing the sea, I was seeing a river that couldn\u2019t have whales nor dolphins.\n\
  \              Although the deception I went to the river and dove with all my happiness,\
  \ with all my emotions, I was only ten years old and I would have other opportunities\
  \ to meet the sea.\n              Today I have nineteen years old and I have never\
  \ seen the sea, sometimes I dream with the day that I will see all that immensity\
  \ just to try again that little freedom that I felt when I was ten, without ever\
  \ forgetting that travel of 2009 that was unique and enchanting. This year and this\
  \ day will always be in my memory for my whole life."
