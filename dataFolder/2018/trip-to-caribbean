Text: "After arrival at Las Americas International Airport I got on the taxi that\
  \ would take me to the hotel located in the center of Santo Domingo.When passing\
  \ througt a tunnel the  taxi had a breakdown of the engine and i had to push the\
  \ car to help get it out to a safe place.Then the taxi driver stopped me another\
  \ taxi to take me to the hotel but not before paying the bill.I finally arrived\
  \ at the hotel drenched in sweat and I was able to take a shower.\n Althougt my\
  \ firs day in the island had been bumpy,the following days were better.I made several\
  \ excursions  with small groups of tourist of other nationalities to spectacular\
  \ place that I had never heard.All excursions I did were exciting and fun but the\
  \ most important thing is that I learned interesting things that I did not know.An\
  \ excursion was on a large sailing catamaran from Bayahibe to Saona Island and another\
  \ one to the natural park Los Haitises where they took us on a boat down a river\
  \ between the mangroves until we reached the mouth and then we disembark in a small\
  \ wooden jetty to visit caves of the ancestors called Tainos.On an excursion to\
  \ a waterfall that is on the mountain in the center of the island I found something\
  \ that I never expected to find.When  I was taking a bath with the group of German\
  \ tourist I climbed the rocks  behind the waterfall to catch mud and spread it on\
  \ the skin put when I put my hands in the mud I took out several fossils of marine\
  \ molluscs."
