Text: "Australia is a country full of hidden gems, from characters, to places. Last\
  \ weekend we packed our swags and headed for my Dads, about three hours drive away.\
  \ We put on a bluegrass playlist and away we went. The drive from our house starts\
  \ out along the Sunshine Coast, a winding road with glimpses of the sea, then we\
  \ turn off and head for the hills. Roads with eucalyptus trees, arching over us,\
  \ like a towering cathedral roof, branches creating a tunnel, of lemony scent to\
  \ drive through. Bellbirds chiming as we climbed the range, windows down with the\
  \ glasshouse mountains in the distance. Tiny towns with colourful Queenslanders,\
  \ blue, green, orange there is even one in a very small town called Moore that is\
  \ pink with a green trim. \nAfter Moore the kids start asking the inevitable question\
  \ on every trip 'are we there yet' every parents dream question when driving. \n\
  We asked them to count the towns that are left, Blackout, Yarraman, Cooyar, Maclagan.\
  \ Winding our way up the bunya mountain range with huge prehistoric bunya pines\
  \ spread out along the ridgeline. \nPast the bakery with the best pies I've ever\
  \ eaten, in Blackbutt. At the top of the tableland now, onto Yarraman. When we saw\
  \ a sign. Coomba Falls, it was accompanied by a picture of some granite boulders\
  \ and what looked like a very small waterhole. 20km's so not far off our route.\
  \ We pulled into the town of Maidenwell, a few houses, a trading post, pub and a\
  \ rodeo grounds which doubles as a camping grounds. The smallest sign ever pointing\
  \ to 'the waterhole' followed by another sign reading 'Coomba Falls 2kms'. We pulled\
  \ up to an empty parking area and a set of stairs heading down past soaring granite\
  \ boulders and grass trees, the air was heavy and hot with the storm on the horizon.\
  \ Three kids and our dog came tumbling out of our car. Salami, crackers, dip and\
  \ a cheese and jar of pickles that we had grabbed from the trading post. Down down\
  \ down the steps we headed with togs and hats, trailing towels and excitement. 20\
  \ steps or more before we saw the waterhole, deep and wide and fuller than expected\
  \ with cliffs of granite boulders, a small waterfall cascading merrily down. Lushness\
  \ unexpected after the dry bush we had travelled through. The kids yells echoed\
  \ off the rocks as the swam, jumped and splashed. It was both the quickest it's\
  \ ever felt to get to my dads, and the longest its actually taken. Onto a weekend\
  \ of motorbikes, horses, bonfires and marshmallows, cousins and cards."
