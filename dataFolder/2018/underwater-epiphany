Text: "The dark blue waves surrounding us become lighter and more inviting as the\
  \ island grows closer. The sun turns my bare shoulders pink, making me impatient\
  \ to dive under the water and feel the cool liquid soothe my skin. \n\nAs we crawl\
  \ towards the jetty a colourful flicker in the water catches my eye. The brochure,\
  \ now stuffed into my backpack, informed me that over 1500 species of fish flourish\
  \ throughout the 3000 kilometre reef that makes up the Great Barrier. \n\nWhen we\
  \ pull up to the jetty I notice a giant slimy-looking fish covered in barnacles\
  \ hanging out below one of the other boats. \n\n\u201CThat\u2019s Gus our resident\
  \ giant groper,\u201D one of the crew tells me. \n\nHe reminds me of Will Turner\u2019\
  s father and the rest of the soulless crew aboard the Flying Dutchman in the Pirates\
  \ of the Caribbean films. \n\n\u201CWe haven\u2019t seen his girlfriend in a while.\
  \ She\u2019s even bigger than he is.\u201D\n\nI find that hard to believe, he looks\
  \ like the size of a small whale. \n\nFinally free from the large catamaran that\
  \ brought me to the island, I dive under the water. The first thing that strikes\
  \ me is the noise. It takes me a second to realise it is the sound of thousands\
  \ of fish grazing. They make small crunching noises as their mouths scrape the coral,\
  \ similar to knives and forks scraping against plates in a busy restaurant. \n\n\
  Dozens of fish glide by unfazed by my presence. A school of grey fish wiggle past\
  \ followed by a little yellow fish. Then a beautiful rainbow fish catches my attention.\
  \ I stick to it like a giant shadow as it makes it way along the reef. Eventually\
  \ I lose it in the flashes of colour. I look around for a new fish to follow.\n\n\
  Suddenly my stomach clenches and I take big gulps of air through the small plastic\
  \ life force attached to my mouth as I try to remain calm.\n\nI find myself face\
  \ to face with the last thing I expected to see this close to shore. Not as big\
  \ as I imagined, its iconic fins, sharp gills and slanted eyes are intimidating\
  \ nonetheless. \n\nI slowly try to back away, but there is no need, my clumsy splashing\
  \ causes it to dart off. With the threat gone, I squint trying to get a better look\
  \ at the dark figure. \n\nIts speed lives up to its reputation. I try to race after\
  \ it and laugh to myself. How backwards is it that I am chasing a shark? \n\nI now\
  \ realise, I had judged all sharks based on a bad few, imagine if humans were judged\
  \ based on a few bad people. \n\nThen I did what any movie lover would do, I hummed\
  \ the Jaws theme tune through my snorkel as I chased a shark."
