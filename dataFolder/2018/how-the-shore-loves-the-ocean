Text: "Out with the tide and the ocean is careful, she recedes from her lover in bed.\
  \ From the all-in embrace that they rolled in together, she listens enraptured to\
  \ his lengthening breaths for the dozing off and her peeling away. It's noon and\
  \ the grand Australian sun beats down on the brilliance of Whitehaven beach - the\
  \ talcum powder jewel in the crown of the Whitsundays. Just two weeks before arriving\
  \ in this Far North Queensland paradise of islands, untouched beaches and charter\
  \ boats, a great cyclone raged through the region and stripped the mountains of\
  \ all greenery while kicking up the sand in the usually pristine water. Chartering\
  \ two sail boats from Hamilton Island and hopping from island to island, four families\
  \ remarked on the beauty of the area in spite of the lingering hurricane carnage\
  \ and debris. The sails slacken as the two sailboats enter the cove of Hill Inlet,\
  \ a calm sun-drenched ease settles in as a scrabble of eager children paddle their\
  \ way to shore ahead of their parents' rafts. It seemed we were only just beginning\
  \ to fill our lungs with the lush forested pathway before coming to the top of the\
  \ hill looking down on the beaches below. After four days of beauty subdued by the\
  \ effects of the earlier cyclone, the view upon reaching the zenith is enough to\
  \ knock the breath from even my father. Beaches of crushed ivory stretch for as\
  \ long as one can see, interrupted only by the inlet itself a hundred metres away.\
  \ The ocean winds and twirls its way into land, creating vastly arcing sandbars\
  \ far inland. The immediate sensation is one of two lovers, the ocean a woman constantly\
  \ retreating and returning from her partner as the tides ebb and flow. Presently,\
  \ the tide recedes.\n\nThe moon will push her once again back with a veracity into\
  \ his open arms, but now is the time for the gentle, the sure pulling back. With\
  \ an arm still under his neck and another draped over his side, great swathes of\
  \ white and brilliant azure present themselves as lazy Sunday morning swirls to\
  \ the tourists far above on the lookouts. The shore stirs a little as his deep blue\
  \ beloved draws out and away, pulling her arms from his body. His sandbanks shift\
  \ a little, a sandbar is brushed, but still he sleeps on through the sandcastles\
  \ built on the edge of his blankets until, with a rush of love, she returns. \n\n\
  One couldn't have prepared me for that spectacle, nor could any camera do it justice,\
  \ yet it's impossible not to try as one stands on the lookout with camera outstretched."
