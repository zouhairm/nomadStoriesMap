Text: "I instantly felt in love with colorful Portugal and a guy called Zygis, whose\
  \ name means ,,trip\u2019\u2019. My story began when I decided to go the Camino\
  \ Portuguese pilgrimage in Portugal. Although I had known Zygis for two weeks I\
  \ asked him ,,Trip, will you go with me on the pilgrim trip?\u2019\u2019. And he\
  \ said ,,Yes''.\nSo, we started our trip from Porto where came on 23th June when\
  \ Portuguese celebrate St. John\u2019s day. Almost every balcony was decorated with\
  \ red and yellow tinsel. The city itself look as a woman dressed in floral dress\
  \ wearing high-heeled shoes and you can\u2019t forget but think of the smell of\
  \ her skin tasting like fresh sardines and olives. The first-place worth visiting:\
  \ Livraria Lello \u2013 it is an inspiring bookshop where you can see the unique\
  \ red staircase -  if one uses their imagination, it could become a red snake which\
  \ could take them to the world of books and wooden, narrowing bookcases reaching\
  \ the ceilings. The second must-go venue is the Majestic Caf\xE9 which brings you\
  \ back to 1921. There is a great discrepancy between tourists dressed casually and\
  \ the place itself as it is so majestic with standing marble columns, the huge mirrors\
  \ on the walls and the massive chandeliers. There my lover told me ,,I like you\u2019\
  \u2019.  \nAs you go out of the city you can sense the more real Portugal \u2013\
  \ full of sincerity and colors, oranges and fresh fish, the hostels are affordable,\
  \ food isn\u2019t expensive either. \nThe pilgrim Portuguese way is a pathway overlooking\
  \ the Atlantic Ocean and tiny villages. Your feet are covered in blisters, you have\
  \ to carry your heavy backpack and go. What is the point of this? I didn't care\
  \ about the purpose - I was in love.\nWe passed by many cities and I can exclude\
  \ two of them: the town Viana de Castelo highlights include the early 20th-century\
  \ Basilica of Santa Luzia and the gothic Cathedral on the Largo da Matriz. There\
  \ we had a cozy room with a wide bed covered in a crocheted pillows. The wind was\
  \ living all night long in upside-down bed. In this city Zygis told me ,,it is good\
  \ to be together''. \nThe other city in Portugal was Caminha \u2013 this city could\
  \ be called a city of nostalgia surrounded by mountains with a long bridge connecting\
  \ Portugal and Spain, where meets Spanish passionate temper and mild blood of Portugal.\
  \ That was the last touch of Portugal. And the last kiss of Zygis telling me ,,you\
  \ are not the right person for me\u2019\u2019. This was the last thing I expected.\
  \ There is no right person or thought, only the right road,- I thought."
