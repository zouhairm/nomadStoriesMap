Text: "Do you know the feeling when it is impossible for you to decide? What do you\
  \ know about \u201Csensation-seeker\u201D? Do you believe in their existence? I\
  \ do. I feel as a monster when defining myself as a sensation-seeker but, thanks\
  \ god, \u201Cmillennials\u201D age have made this concept easier to understand.\
  \ Ideas are changing and people like me are not weird anymore. (I wish I could see\
  \ my parents, 40 years before, trying to explain my grandparents about their sensation-seeker\
  \ ideas!). So, I recognized it! I am one of those called \u201Cmillennials\u201D\
  , and maybe all you can read about them, it\u2019s me: We suffer of technology addiction,\
  \ constant dissatisfaction, readiness ability in the sense of being always into\
  \ more than one thing and even into more than one screen\u2026 wait, I say \u201C\
  suffer\u201D? We do enjoy!! We all enjoy a high-level education and mybe this make\
  \ us much more curious, something that flow out in making us more travellers than\
  \ earlier generations were, and what means this but an extra achieved freedom? The\
  \ question is, why I am in telling all these things? Just to explain why I wasn\u2019\
  t capable of selecting only one of the proposed topics. I need to talk all about\
  \ my story. For sure, talking about my short but long life (25 years old) would\
  \ be needing a whole book, (good for my nephews!), but when writing about a travel\
  \ story that can make you feel something, my story embraces those three topics.\
  \ I will start from the beginning: Making a local connection. Everything starts\
  \ one day, when mum and dad gave me the fantastic news of their decision to make\
  \ a family trip. Time to introduce more of myself: I am 25 years old, studied an\
  \ English philology degree, I do work hard in a little event organization business\
  \ (I love organising things), but nowadays nothing makes me rich, and my PASSION\
  \ in life is travelling. But not travelling when I do have some free days at work,\
  \ not waiting for my work-holidays to travel. I need to travel, I need to know new\
  \ cultures, and I have the need of making my life just for travelling. So, when\
  \ my parents gave me the big news of a (free) travel, you may imagine how my happiness\
  \ was increased. The destination was the Caribbean Sea, to me more precise, a cruise\
  \ parting from Puerto Rico and traveling all around little islands. I won\xB4t be\
  \ relating the whole trip, even though I would make you love it: I\u2019m such a\
  \ good storyteller. What I\u2019ll be sharing in this story is about the experience\
  \ of one of the isles we visit: St Maarten."
