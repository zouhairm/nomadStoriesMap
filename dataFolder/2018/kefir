Text: "It was a lovely morning in Las Cruces, New Mexico. As I was enjoying breakfast\
  \ outdoors, I ran into the owner of the B&B, LaVerne. She\u2019s an 84 year-old\
  \ beauty with a surprisingly deep voice and very stylish leggings that she purchased\
  \ for $7 on E-bay. She has flowing white hair, which was kept up in a clip, leaving\
  \ a few wisps around her face. We made small talk, and I continued to eat. 5 minutes\
  \ later, LaVerne steps outside and walks past me, down to the outdoor kitchen. She\
  \ returns with a jug of some strange drink. When she passed by me again to go into\
  \ the house, she said something unintelligible, so I turned and said \u201Cwhat?\u201D\
  \n\nShe responded, \u201CHave you ever had Kefir?\u201D \n\u201CNo\u2026 what is\
  \ it?\u201D I inquired, concerned.\nShe promptly responds, \u201COh, it\u2019s fermented,\
  \ raw milk.\u201D\n\nWTF.\n\n\u201CIt\u2019s delicious. Here, I\u2019ll bring you\
  \ out a glass.\u201D My heart stopped.\n\nA person in this situation has two options.\
  \ The first is to respectfully decline. Instead, I chose to be brave and try something\
  \ new. So, politely, I tasted the cold beverage. I gently tilted the short glass\
  \ around in a circle and stared at the massive clump that sat at the bottom of the\
  \ glass, while the thick, creamy milk swirled around. I sniffed it a couple times,\
  \ hoping that LaVerne\u2019s statement of devotion would help me change my mind\
  \ and that maybe there\u2019s a chance I would enjoy the drink.\n\nI brought the\
  \ rim up to my lips and let the smallest portion of kefir rush into my mouth. I\
  \ can\u2019t bring myself to describe the flavor, other than the overwhelming kick\
  \ of acidity and the pungent taste of the cultured dairy. I instantly gagged\u2026\
  . and again. I knew I couldn\u2019t spit it out, and I had to swallow before the\
  \ rancid milk would overtake me. I quickly swallowed and shoved a spoonful of raisin\
  \ bran in my mouth to dispel the taste. I gagged more times than I can remember.\
  \ I even OFFERED IT TO THE CAT and the cat WOULDN\u2019T DRINK IT. \n\nI felt violated.\
  \ My stomach was betrayed. I was sitting there with nearly a full glass of kefir\
  \ and no idea of what to do next. So I stood up and returned to my suite, leaving\
  \ the glass on the table for LaVerne to discover. \n\nI will never think of milk\
  \ the same way again. Not if it\u2019s dehydrated, pasteurized, raw, fermented,\
  \ plain, flavored (okay, maybe Darigold chocolate milk), or if it came out of a\
  \ cow\u2019s tit this second. Nope, I\u2019m done. Thank you, LaVerne, for sharing\
  \ your culture (pun intended) and for destroying my faith in humanity and all that\
  \ is good. \n\nWritten by a traumatized Casey H."
