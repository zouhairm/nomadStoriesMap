Text: "\u201CEnan?\u201D I turn around. \u201CEnan where are you?\u201D\nMy screams\
  \ are muffled by the sounds of the city. No one can hear me. Cars zip past me and\
  \ people shove me in different directions; lightning strikes the hapless skyscrapers\
  \ until the sky is a maelstrom of light and thunder. I\u2019m soaked in sweat and\
  \ rain and tears, the latter a result of my failure to protect Enan.\nThe adhan\
  \ for maghrib- which coincides with the sky\u2019s transition from scarlet to a\
  \ tender indigo- blares from the minarets. I would normally find the imam\u2019\
  s nasally call to prayer comforting, however at this moment, it signals that darkness\
  \ will soon blanket the city. The fairy lights which dangle from the stores in the\
  \ Centre Bazaar will soon flicker on, and the congested street- replete with motorcycles,\
  \ Honda sedans, three wheeled motorized CNGs, and rickshaws- will be lighted by\
  \ these meager Eid decorations and the dim lights of the vehicles themselves. I\
  \ have never been in a situation like this in a city like this. I am not in Fair\
  \ Lawn, New Jersey; I am in Chittagong, Bangladesh. Street lights are scarce, traffic\
  \ lights are nonexistent, and people carelessly weave through the speeding vehicles.\n\
  Just moments before we were separated amidst the chaos of other shoppers, Enan -\
  \ my younger cousin - agreed to walk with me to Aarong, the city\u2019s largest\
  \ antiquities store. While our mothers were trying on gold necklaces- \u201Cit\u2019\
  ll take a while,\u201D my mother told us, eyeing rows upon rows of the flashy metal-\
  \ Enan and I crossed the shopping plaza.\nAnd now I have no idea where he is.\n\
  As I\u2019m looking for Enan, there\u2019s a buzzing in my ears. The hum comes and\
  \ goes at unexpected intervals; I\u2019d prefer a constant stream of noise.\n\n\
  In Chittagong, there is never silence. White noise surrounds you, drowns you, becomes\
  \ you, so that you become the white noise. And I became the white noise, the city.\n\
  \nThe buzzing escalates, as if all the shrieks and screams and cries of the beggars\
  \ and youth and burqa clad women emanate from a spirit- the metaphysical manifestation\
  \ of the sounds of the city- which stalks me as I\u2019m searching for my cousin.\
  \ The thrumming eventually quells as I continue making my rounds of the boutiques.\
  \ Defeated, I walk back to the jewelry store, preparing myself for my mother\u2019\
  s lengthy diatribe; \u201Che\u2019s your younger brother!\u201D she\u2019ll start.\
  \ I\u2019m thinking about when she\u2019ll begin crying- either before, after, or\
  \ during the tirade- when I see Enan standing behind her in front of the boutique;\
  \ her arms are crossed."
