Text: "Freeing The Giants\n\nSixty-five kilometers north of Chiangmai in the Mae Taeng\
  \ valley of Northern Thailand, there is a magical place. Surrounded by misty mountains\
  \ and rich, tropical foliage lies Elephant Nature Park. Not the average tourist\
  \ attraction, there are no elephant rides or circus acts. Here the elephants, some\
  \ blind, some lame, most quite old, roam free guided only by verbal commands from\
  \ their mahouts. Along with the elephants the park is home to a herd of rescued\
  \ water buffalo, hundreds of dogs, cats, cows and pigs. For Founder Seangduean \u201C\
  Lek\u201D Chailert, this is just the way it is. \n\nAsian elephant populations are\
  \ dwindling with only an estimated 30,000 left globally. In Thailand, there is an\
  \ estimated 3-4,000 with about 50 percent of them \u201Cdomesticated\u201D.  These\
  \ animals suffer from horrific abuse, loss of habitat, poaching and human greed.\
  \ Lek aspires to end elephant suffering in the tourist trade and illegal logging\
  \ industry by giving them their freedom and working for conservation of the species.\
  \ \n\nLek founded Elephant Nature Park in the 1990\u2019s as a sanctuary for rescued\
  \ elephants. Through the efforts of Save Elephant Foundation, ENP is Thailand\u2019\
  s most successful elephant conservation/rehabilitation operation.  Through local\
  \ community outreach, educational eco-tourism programs and social media, news of\
  \ the plight of these Gentle Giants is spreading rapidly.  The park receives hundreds\
  \ of visitors weekly. Some stay and volunteer.  Daily tasks include cleaning night\
  \ enclosures, unloading produce from local farms and general park cleanup all while\
  \ surrounded by elephants.\n\nAs the park\u2019s celebrity grows, not everyone in\
  \ Thailand is pleased. Some of the staff at ENP received threats from jealous rivals.\
  \ Young elephants are big money makers in the tourist industry. They\u2019re found\
  \ begging for money, performing tricks and being manhandled for the ubiquitous selfie.\
  \ Often unaware of the abuse the animal suffers, tourists pay to ride them.\n\n\
  Lek\u2019s dedication never falters. As word spreads, more camps adopt the ENP model.\
  \ Outreach continues in Thailand, neighboring Myanmar and Cambodia. Across the globe,\
  \ awareness of the effects of climate change, declining species and animal welfare\
  \ drive consumers to make more humane, sustainable choices.  For ENP, it\u2019s\
  \ working. \n\nWhen asked what the best way for the average person to help the elephants\
  \ was, Lek responded, \u201CBe their voice.\u201D Though there are many, there is,\
  \ perhaps, no louder voice for the Giant than hers."
