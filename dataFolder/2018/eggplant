Text: "Salina is not the most popular of the Aeolian Islands. Lipari, the biggest,\
  \ Panarea, for jetsetters, and Stromboli or Vulcano, with their smoky mystique,\
  \ are higher on the list. Unless you are a fan of Mario Ruoppolo's Il Postino. What\
  \ the sparse visitors know is that it has some of the most life-changing food you\
  \ could ask for.\n\nThree ingredients define the island's cuisine: capers, olives\
  \ and fish. You will find these in almost all dishes throughout the island. This\
  \ does not imply a lack of ingenuity from Salina's chefs. They see the island\u2019\
  s geographic limitation as its best resource, for it has concentrated its flavors\
  \ into this gastronomical holy trinity, which they have turned into the trademark\
  \ of its cuisine.\n\nFamous island-wide, Signum Hotel's restaurant in Malfa is an\
  \ immersion in the Italian dolce far niente. Through three hours or more, you experience\
  \ the best Salina has to offer with the refinement of a Michellin-starred restaurant.\
  \ Nothing prepared me for the delight I felt when each sliver of a lightly-seared\
  \ tuna steak touched my tongue. Its tenderness, vivid color and flavor almost felt\
  \ indecent. Marrying each dish with Italian wines, including the local Malvasia\
  \ delle Lipari with its heady swirl of floral bouquet, this wasn\u2019t just a meal\
  \ \u2013 it was an unexpected journey I was happy to take.\n\nHowever, it's not\
  \ necessary to break the bank to have an idyllic gastronomic experience. In Pollara,\
  \ L'oasi seems like an ordinary kiosk for a quick snack or drink, but its Mediterranean\
  \ salad was all my stomach craved under the scorching Sun. Capers as big as olives\
  \ sprinkled among crisp greens, fresh mozzarella slices and tuna pieces. Simple.\
  \ Elegant. Unforgettable.\n\nBack in Malfa, A'Lumaredda was a delightful surprise.\
  \ Typical family business, the proprietor smiled at me when he saw my delight with\
  \ his captivating dishes. The menu screamed PASTA ALLA NORMA at me. I knew I had\
  \ to try it - one of the most traditional dishes of the Sicilian region, it is a\
  \ simple and fresh combination of tomatoes, ricotta\u2026and eggplant.\nGrowing\
  \ up, I never liked eggplant, though I couldn\u2019t say why. The last thing I expected\
  \ was to fall in love with it in the form of pasta alla Norma. Served with toothsome\
  \ pasta, each forkful is a taste of Sicily: simple, yet captivating.\n\nSalina has\
  \ beautiful nature, deep blue sea and indescribable views of Stromboli's smoky mood\
  \ swings. But I would easily come back just for its fish, capers and olives. Maybe\
  \ even its eggplant."
