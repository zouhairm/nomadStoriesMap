Text: "Who knows what he might've been smoking. The man in Harlem with the scarred\
  \ cheek and cluster of chains around his neck surreally mirrored my thoughts.\"\
  Yo momma told ya not to talk to strangers\" he said as I passed him. But does that\
  \ advice still apply in the middle of a natural disaster? I took my seat on the\
  \ train, my palms still clammy.  \n\nShe waited for me on the platform. I hadn\u2019\
  t showered in three days - my hair was so oily Dunkin\u2019 could fry their doughnuts\
  \ in it and I\u2019m pretty sure I smelled like rotting garbage. Am I not supposed\
  \ to be in the land of tall-decaf-caramel-soy-lattes and honey? How did I end up\
  \ here?\n\nTwo nights earlier, the wind was seething. The trees swayed from side\
  \ to side as if a dark sorcerer was controlling them. Occasionally lightning pierced\
  \ the sky. I was stuck in The Big Apple and Hurricane Sandy was taking her bite.\
  \ In my hotel room, looking for distraction from my racing thoughts, I flipped through\
  \ photos on my Canon. The images transported me into another reality \u2013 a city\
  \ that pulses possibility, locals hustling to achieve their dreams, deafening sirens\
  \ and headache-inducing lights that make you feel like you\u2019ve followed Alice\
  \ down the rabbit hole. \n\nMy checkout date had arrived, but hotels remained full\
  \ as people struggled to fly out, new ones kept coming in and the New York marathon\
  \ was scheduled. My heart rate would have broken an EKG: I now had refugee-like\
  \ status in the majestic kingdom of Manhattan. I stepped outside. Only a few other\
  \ souls were trudging through the sludgy debris. Business signs still depressingly\
  \ proclaimed \u2018closed\u2019 and I could actually hear my own footsteps. News\
  \ came like autumn leaves: power outages, evacuations, the death toll\u2026\n\n\
  Where else to go, but the airport? Her name tag said Kaatja. Tough years were etched\
  \ onto her face. She was the first person to see me looking lost. \"Mami, you've\
  \ been crying ...? Do not cry, mami. I will sort you out, mami.\u201D My sunken\
  \ eyes and blotched cheeks must have given me away. Minutes later a message came\
  \ through on my phone. Through word of mouth in South Africa, 10 000 miles away,\
  \ someone heard of my predicament and sent word that Caroline in Connecticut had\
  \ a room free. After exhaling pure relief, Kaatja put me on a train to Connecticut\
  \ via Harlem. \n\nSeventy-two hours as Caroline\u2019s guest have passed. In the\
  \ airport parking lot, I asked her how I would ever be able to repay her. She leaned\
  \ in for a (mother) bear hug and whispered, \"Just pay it forward.\""
