Text: "Since childhood, I\u2019d long held a fascination with the ancient cultures\
  \ of the Inca, Maya and Aztec people across the Americas. \nWith enough money saved\
  \ and an unwavering determination, I visited Machu Picchu in late 2009. \nThe Inca\
  \ Trail had me traverse a landscape that was lush and green, physically challenging\
  \ and rewarding. \nOn the fourth day of the journey, the Sun Gate greeted me atop\
  \ the last set of ancient stone stairs. \nThere, through the archway and veiled\
  \ in wisps of early morning cloud was the once lost citadel I had longed to visit.\
  \ \nWith only a few hours to explore, I set off to be immersed in a place that remains\
  \ mired in mystery as to its purpose and why the people that lived here left. \n\
  Wandering the narrow spaces between the still firm stone walls of buildings, I was\
  \ immersed in an aura that I can only describe as \u2018magic\u2019. \nI ventured\
  \ closer to the peak that looked down upon Machu Picchu that had slowly been revealed\
  \ as the sun burnt away the cloud. \nAs only 400 people are permitted to ascend\
  \ the narrow tunnels and narrow steps that led to The Temple of the Moon perched\
  \ on Huayna Picchu, I raced to sign my name and was fortunate to secure the 300th\
  \ spot. \nA small ledge provided respite at the halfway point and, the most spectacular\
  \ view. \nCamera in hand, I snapped pictures from every angle and it was whilst\
  \ I was lost in my photo taking that I realised, I had company. \nA fellow traveler,\
  \ from Canada, alerted me to the fact I was perhaps moving a little too close to\
  \ the edge. \nAfter retreating a few steps and thanking her for her help, we chatted\
  \ about where we were from and what brought us to Machu Picchu. \nOur shared enamourment\
  \ with an ancient place and its people had spurred both of us from separate and\
  \ contrasting homes of our own, to visit a truly magical and wondrous destination.\
  \ \nTogether, we made our way to the Temple of the Moon, took photos of one another\
  \ with the ruins providing a sensational backdrop. My ever cheesy grin indicative\
  \ of the sheer delight and excitement that I had finally found my way to Machu Picchu\
  \ and, after travelling here alone, had found a kindred soul who shared my enthusiasm\
  \ and passion. \nWe met as strangers and parted ways knowing just the other\u2019\
  s first name but our memories of a meeting half-a-world away on a hillside ledge\
  \ live on."
