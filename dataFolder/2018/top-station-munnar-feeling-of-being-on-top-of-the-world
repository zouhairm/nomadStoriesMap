Text: "Here I come to share my amazing experience that I had at Top Station few weeks\
  \ ago. Kerala had always been on top of my wish list for its Beauty, Food and friendly\
  \ People. Especially Munnar. Munnar is known for its scenic beauty that has wonderful\
  \ tea plantations. Few of my friends who had been brought up in North Eastern states\
  \ of India where there are tea plantations also said that Munnar is something else\
  \ when it comes to the beauty and the taste of tea(Yes I am a tea addict\U0001F601\
  ) . So I decided that this is going to be my next destination. \n\n     Munnar welcomed\
  \ me and my friends with beautiful weather. As soon as we got down the bus, those\
  \ words said by everyone about this place felt true. We could see hills surrounded\
  \ by us which were covered by fog and clouds. \n\n     We had booked a room in 3rd\
  \ floor of an hotel which had Balcony. Entire Munnar city could be seen by the Balcony\
  \ and the view was just breath takingly Beautiful. By the time we got freshened\
  \ up and came out of our rooms to have lunch, it had started drizzling. We had mouth\
  \ watering authentic Kerala food i.e Appam, Fish Curry, Fish fry and we were all\
  \ set to roam around the city.\n\nFirst we went to the most known place for tastiest\
  \ tea which is Kannan Devan Hills and had tea that was made from fresh tea leaves.\
  \ The auroma of it itself is just enough to get addicted to it.\n\n     Beware to\
  \ carry warm clothes because nights in Munnar are freezing cold. You just cannot\
  \ step on the floor without wearing socks. All you feel like doing is just curl\
  \ upon the bed and enjoy the sound of rain and the view from Balcony with yummy\
  \ food.\n\n     Next day our destination was Top Station which is 30 kms from Munnar\
  \ town. There will be cabs arranged by hotel itself which can take you to Top Station.\
  \ We left the hotel at 7.30 AM and by the time we reached Top Station it was 9.30\
  \ AM which was just the opening time of the ticket counter for the entrance. \n\n\
  \      On the way towards Top Station, I bet that you won't stop Awwwing at Nature.\
  \ We were the first customers to buy entry tickets for the day. From the entrance,\
  \ we followed the trail which lead towards several view points. I have no words\
  \ to describe the feeling that I felt. I had never experienced that Calmness, that\
  \ Peace surrounded by the hills before. All we did was sit and listen to nature\
  \ with soothing music.\n\n    There are lot of places in Munnar which makes me want\
  \ to go back again.Once again mesmerized by the work of Creator."
