Text: "One step, two steps, three steps, pause. One step, two steps,... The mantra\
  \ continued at a cost I was not sure how to keep paying. All my energy was focused\
  \ on that one simple thing: walk 3 steps before pausing for 5 seconds. It was so\
  \ simple, and yet felt so impossible. The bright snowy-white landscape of the High\
  \ Atlas was as dazzling beautiful as oppressive in its endlessness. I already knew\
  \ that above 3000m we would start feeling the unpleasant effects of the oxygen scarcity,\
  \ but I just realized that theory is much milder when we are comfortably sitting\
  \ in our couch, than when we are living it in reality.\nA couple of meters ahead,\
  \ our guide Ibrahim was encouraging us to keep up, luring us with the prospect of\
  \ the Toubkal refuge being just close ahead. \"Just close ahead\u201D is a concept\
  \ that in the mountain has a different meaning than our usual references. At my\
  \ pace of three steps and five seconds of pause it could take a while.\nEventually\
  \ we got to the refuge. In spite of my struggles, Ibrahim was happy about our timing.\
  \ Looking back, his encouragement was critical to keep my spirit lifted and my mind\
  \ ready for the next day: the summit.\nAfter a well-deserved sleep, we resumed our\
  \ journey at 4am. It was pitch dark, and we could only see the few meters that our\
  \ head lamps lit ahead of our feet. We walked for hours in total darkness, until\
  \ dawn came slowly shedding its soft colors on the mountain. By sunrise we started\
  \ meeting other trekkers. Some were passing us, some were left behind. There was\
  \ only one way to the summit of Toubkal, but each traveler negotiated its own pace\
  \ with the mountain.\nMy body was on the verge of rebellion against the extreme\
  \ effort. Each row of 3 steps was harder to keep, and every once in a while I had\
  \ to double the 5 seconds pause. At some point I was ready to abandon the goal of\
  \ the summit, and settle for whatever height we had already achieved. Anyway, it\
  \ was already greater than anything I had done before. When I reached Ibrahim to\
  \ inform him of my decision, he pointed ahead and said \u201CIt\u2019s right there.\
  \ You made it!\u201D I could barely believe his words, but a last burst of energy\
  \ took me through those final meters, and we actually reached the summit!\nWe were\
  \ at 4167m, the highest point of North Africa, and the beautiful clear skies allowed\
  \ us to see all around us, far in the distance until the desert!\nA trip is worth\
  \ for how far it takes us. This trip to Morocco took me further and higher than\
  \ ever. That\u2019s the biggest worth!"
