Text: "I remember seeing footage on MTV of some crazy guys in New Zealand bungee jumping\
  \ off of a bridge when I was a kid. It scared the hell out of me but also intrigued\
  \ me. As a freckle-faced, eye-glass-wearing pre-teen I could only dream of living\
  \ such a wild, carefree lifestyle. I mean, who is crazy enough to throw themselves\
  \ off a bridge?! Well, apparently I am. A few days ago, I was finishing up the self-drive\
  \ portion of a 2 week solo road trip through the North and South Islands of New\
  \ Zealand and saw signs for \u2018the world\u2019s first bungee jump.\u2019 Something\
  \ inside of me clicked into place. I made a U-turn on the road from Wanaka to Queenstown\
  \ and walked into the AJ Hackett bungee jumping center as if I\u2019d been planning\
  \ to take this plunge my entire life. Thirty minutes later, I was being hoisted\
  \ down into a raft and viewing footage of a calm-looking chick jumping off the Kawarau\
  \ bridge. I didn\u2019t quite reach the water, but I came out the other end feeling\
  \ more confident and more proud of myself than ever before. AJ Hackett offers a\
  \ variety of bungee jumping packages, from basic, single jump offerings to packages\
  \ of five bungee jumps to jump + canyon swing combos that range from $85NZD to $485NZD.\
  \ I opted for a two-pack option that had me jumping from the Kawarau Bridge (43M)\
  \ as well as the third tallest bungee jump in the world - the Nevis Jump (134M).\
  \ After completing the Kawarau Bridge jump, I pre-booked my Nevis jump for the very\
  \ next morning at 9am. The next day, I arrived at the AJ Hackett office bright and\
  \ early. There, I met the other brave jumpers and we were driven about 45 minutes\
  \ out of the town to the cable car that takes you to the Nevis bungee platform.\
  \ The second jump was a lot more intimidating. Two people had already chickened\
  \ out that morning and one of the younger guys in our group threw up twice pre-jump.\
  \ I was in it to win it so, despite my nerves, I stepped up to the platform dancing\
  \ my way to the edge, closed my eyes, and jumped at the count of 3. Was it all worth\
  \ it? 100%. Who is this woman who was just re-baptized into a new, daring life?!\
  \  I highly recommend purchasing one of the video/photo packages on offer. AJ Hackett\
  \ does a standout job of capturing all of your angles in a professional video ready\
  \ within minutes of your jump. I ended up buying both of my photo/video packages,\
  \ which run between $90-140NZD because, well, I probably won't be jumping off a\
  \ bridge in the near future, and now I have the proof to last me a lifetime."
