Text: "\"Let's join the pride parade!\" I groggily proposed to Po-Hsien, my Taiwanese\
  \ friend of 3 hours, after waking up from his bed. I looked out at the cloudy skies\
  \ hanging over dull apartments, rooftops speckled with potted plants and drying\
  \ laundry. I hope it won't rain on this parade; it is past typhoon season after\
  \ all.\n\nWe both crashed out after I reached his place and introduced myself in\
  \ the morning: A red-eye flight from Singapore sapped me dry,  while a late night\
  \ of work did him in. A rash decision to buy cheap flights brought me to Taipei,\
  \ and he kindly agreed to host me after reading my request on a homestay website.\
  \ \n\nIn most of Asia, asking a heterosexual to join a pride parade would certainly\
  \ be questionable. \"Oh, that. Let me check where it'll be.\" He replied with dimmed\
  \ eyes before looking down at his phone. The annual Taipei Pride, which holds the\
  \ honor of being the largest in East Asia, has become a tourist attraction in its\
  \ own right, and local opinions towards . For Taiwanese LGBT activists, this year's\
  \ parade is a celebration, as Taiwan's Constitutional Court ruled to grant same-sex\
  \ couples the right to marry just a few months ago, paving the way to become the\
  \ first place in Asia that recognizes same-sex marriage.\n\nAfter conversations\
  \ over glistening bowls of minced meat rice for lunch, we were ready to pop our\
  \ pride march cherries. Po-Hsien picked the city route, and we walked along same-sex\
  \ couples holding hands with hopeful eyes, Taiwanese men in Japanese costumes marching\
  \ beside the baroque-styled Presidential Office Building, and aborigines in their\
  \ traditional costumes embracing their partners. Besides painting the streets with\
  \ the rainbow, volunteers shared sex education tips, and gave out loads of paraphernalia.\
  \ We snuck out occasionally to munch on piping hot scallion pancakes, while relishing\
  \ the humor and innuendoes in their messages.\n\n\"What do you think about this,\
  \ Po-Hsien?\" I asked. \"It's great, I feel more proud of my country actually!\"\
  \ In contrast to the pride events back home in Singapore, which could never be a\
  \ march due to restrictions on freedom of speech and assembly, I couldn't agree\
  \ more. As we walked under the sunset hues while sipping my cup of bubble milk tea,\
  \ I gazed at the rippling rainbow flag flanked with jovial smiles and wondered,\
  \ how beautiful the world would be if everyone would let all these colors into their\
  \ lives."
