Text: "Three Savana weeks ago we landed in Ouagadougou, the capital city. The previous\
  \ French colony Upper Volta was renamed in the local language Moor\xE9 after its\
  \ independence leader Thomas Sankara: Burkina Faso \u2013 the land of the upright\
  \ man. Gando was supposed to be the final destination of our trip. However according\
  \ to the \u201Ccivilized world\u2019s\u201D communication solutions, Gando does\
  \ not exist. Fortunately, our driver Denis who speaks Moor\xE9 except French could\
  \ ask on the way. There are 81 ethnic groups and languages in Burkina Faso. Moosi\
  \ people are the majority in the country. The interesting description for the way\
  \ given by the architect was also still in my mind. \u201CTurn right from the remarkable\
  \ Baobab tree\u201D. We found it easier than I thought except the fact that there\
  \ is not a real street to turn right. In a few dozen meters we were in the middle\
  \ of the reddish bumpy Savanna landscape, which was full of mango and baobab trees.\
  \ The trees in general in Burkina Faso take my breathe away. They extend as far\
  \ as possible to all directions. They open their hundred arms to embrace the nature.\
  \ I have the impression, that they grow  to give shelter to as many people as possible,\
  \ like an affectionate mother. There is also the Baobab. Baobabs are almighty. Whenever\
  \ I pass by a baobab tree I feel I need to stop and pay homage to him. They grow\
  \ wide on their trunks, they open up wild to the sky and they are solitary. They\
  \ need so much soil and water that baobab trees do not grow up close to each other.\
  \ They need their independence. \nAfter many bumpy jumps, through the loosely set\
  \ vernacular village compounds, we reached a denser ensemble of trees. The primary\
  \ school complex, in the middle of nature, not isolated but integrated looked very\
  \ alive with 800 children running all around. I turned my head and I saw him. Sitting\
  \ on a chair under a huge tree on the skirt of the hill with his blue greenish guitar\
  \ on his lap, unaware of the sheep passing by. His name was Petra. Petra means rock,\
  \ he said. His father named him. Conseiller principal d\u2019education. My broken\
  \ French was giving me hard time now. He was expecting us. Not so early though.\
  \ Too hot to work, the students were in the break. He offered to sing for me instead.\
  \ I accepted. He was a natural born talent, singing about a white dove without mistakes.\
  \ He pronounced my name twice in the song and then I realized that he improvised\
  \ for me.  What a magical moment to start a day I thought."
