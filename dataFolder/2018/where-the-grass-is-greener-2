Text: "We had walked for hours: rucksacks on our sore backs, blisters on our feet,\
  \ and empty stomachs waiting to be filled with canned ravioli. The first hours we\
  \ had chatted a lot, but now we just wanted to find a nice green field to set up\
  \ the camp.\n\nThat particular day however, it took us a long time to find one.\
  \ It was late in the afternoon when we finally arrived at a tiny village up a green\
  \ hill. At the center of it, there was a small square with a church. There were\
  \ no signs of life whatsoever. The group leaders decided we had to find a field\
  \ as soon as possible, so we split up. Three teams went off to find a sleeping spot,\
  \ leaving the rest, a bunch of teenagers, behind. Moaning loudly, us laggards gladly\
  \ removed our rucksacks from our backs, making ourselves comfortable on the ground.\
  \ \n\nA couple of hours later, there was still no sign of the others. Heroically,\
  \ me and a friend decided we would go find a good field ourselves. We did not have\
  \ to search long before we bumped into a local resident who, to me, looked as if\
  \ he knew how to define a nice green field. Unfortunately, his car only offered\
  \ space for two. \u201CCan you go tell the others I am going to check out this field\
  \ he's talking about?\u201D I asked my friend. He told me yes, and left. Soon, my\
  \ new friend started the engine and off we went.\n\nThe German drove us down the\
  \ hill, out of the village. That moment, I realised two things. Firstly, I did not\
  \ bring my phone. Secondly, the German was wearing very tight leather shorts, drawing\
  \ my attention to his thick hairy legs. That was the moment I figured this probably\
  \ had not been a smart move. \u201CCalm down\u201D, I told myself, \u201Cdon\u2019\
  t worry, he is okay.\u201D The German drove us into a nearby forest and after a\
  \ few minutes, we arrived at a small open space \u201CEhm, I don't think this place\u2019\
  s large enough. Is it okay if we go back?\u201D, I asked him. \u201COf course\u201D\
  , he said. \n\nBy the time we were back at the square, everyone had returned. I\
  \ jumped out of the car. \u201CYou're all back!\u201D, I smiled. \u201CDid you find\
  \ anything?\u201D Then I looked at my friends. Their faces were frozen and I could\
  \ hear a pin drop. Breaking the awkward silence, my female group leader thanked\
  \ Hairy Legs, and we said goodbye. \n\nThat night, when we sat around the campfire,\
  \ enjoying its heat and the guitar music vibrating in the air, I couldn't imagine\
  \ any safer place than that piece of land. Years later, I sometimes still catch\
  \ myself watching out of the car window, looking out for a nice green field to call\
  \ home."
