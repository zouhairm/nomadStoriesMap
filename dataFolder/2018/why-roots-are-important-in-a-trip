Text: "It had been a trip to Rio de Janeiro, my first time there. It was simply amazing.\
  \ I went with a friend, we would spend fourteen days, four of them in S\xE3o Paulo.\
  \ The first surprise came when the airplane began to fly over that incredible city,\
  \ from above I could see all that natural beauty. It's lovely. All those mountains\
  \ covered with vegetation, it was wonderful. The second surprise was the weather\
  \ in the city, it was warm but not as much as in my state, and in the evening I\
  \ experienced a delicious refreshing sensation on the skin. I was in Brazil, but\
  \ it looked like another country. The more I knew the people, the more I wondered\
  \ how a nation could have so different cultures. I needed to absorb everything about\
  \ that new discovery, I felt like Pedro \xC1lvares Cabral himself. What amused me\
  \ most was the accent. In the first day, we went to visit the Christ statue, it's\
  \ almost mandatory. In the immense sculpture of Christ, we meet not only with brazilians,\
  \ but with americans, argentines, germans, it was evident the immense cultural burden\
  \ that each of them displayed. It was amazing to see so many different people together.\
  \ My friend and I started a conversation with a group who spoke English, at the\
  \ time we were doing a course of that language and we could not miss the opportunity,\
  \ it was great! Like us, they were loving the city, we were sweating under the sun,\
  \ but the conversation was too warm for us to worry about that. And that is the\
  \ most wonderful! We often compare new places with where we came from, sometimes\
  \ even despising the new climate, the new culture, the new menu. However, the sense\
  \ of a trip is to connect with the place and absorb the good things it has to offer\
  \ through sight, hearing, smell, taste and touch; we should also connect with people,\
  \ I had the opportunity to meet not only natives of that city, but tourists from\
  \ all over the world. During the fourteen-day trip, I sought to put root in the\
  \ places I was knowing, to expand my roots, and today I am still extracting the\
  \ acquired knowledge from that trip. In the end, you know you made a good local\
  \ connection when you feel there was an exchange of experience between you and whom\
  \ you interacted with. The truth is that I am a tree, of those very giants, whose\
  \ roots are extremely expansive and are feeded with culture. I guess it is time\
  \ to feed me again, I am begining to be hungry."
