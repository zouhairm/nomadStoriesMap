Text: "My whole family believes in ghosts. Is that a Filipino thing? I\u2019ve never\
  \ had a run-in with a supernatural being in my adopted city of Paris. But returning\
  \ to my mother\u2019s hometown in the province of Batangas for the first time in\
  \ 25 years, I discovered that most of my eighty-or-so relatives swear our family\
  \ compound is haunted.\n  \nMy 'Eat, Pray, Love' experience might be better described\
  \ as 'Eat, Mahjong, Karaoke'. (Mostly eating.) And it was around the mahjong table\
  \ one sweltering afternoon during my homecoming tour that I heard the stories. Amid\
  \ the familiar clacking of tiles and steady stream of gossip in tangy Tagalog, the\
  \ name \u2018Spongebob\u2019 jumped out at me. Tita Evangelina, my mother\u2019\
  s 76-year-old sister, clutched my hands and looked up at me through the beginnings\
  \ of cataracts. \u2018I was visited by a spirit,\u2019 she said simply. The spirit\
  \ looked like Spongebob Squarepants, she explained, and came into her room one night.\
  \ She did as any good Filipina would do and offered him food.\n\u2018And then what\
  \ happened?\u2019\n\u2018He bit me.\u2019\n\u2018Are you sure you didn\u2019t just\
  \ scratch yourself in your sleep?\u2019 I asked, but she had no doubt of what she\
  \ had experienced, and reminded me that many in our family have the third eye. Like\
  \ Alvin, her niece\u2019s boyfriend, who has claimed to see an old man seated at\
  \ the piano, next to the family\u2019s prized statuette of Santo Ni\xF1o. \n \n\
  Tita Rosalinda pipes up that the garden where I played as a child is full of 'dwende',\
  \ or gnomes. A cautionary tale: one of my uncles, stumbling home drunk one night,\
  \ unwittingly relieved himself on one in the yard. This naturally angered the dwende,\
  \ who retaliated by causing my uncle\u2019s testicles to swell up. How to appease\
  \ a dwende who\u2019s pissed off because he\u2019s been pissed on? Unsurprisingly,\
  \ the answer is with food. My ailing uncle put out a plate of 'pancit' noodles for\
  \ the garden-dwelling spirit; order was restored.\n\nAfter all that Filipino folklore\
  \ and losing at mahjong, I needed a drink. For this round of \u2018tagay\u2019,\
  \ I'm appointed \u2018tangera\u2019, with the responsibility of serving the booze,\
  \ always from the same shot glass passed around in a circle. A ceremonial portion\
  \ is poured on the ground \u2013 for the spirits.\n\nCousin Maricar seizes me by\
  \ the shoulders and plants a kiss on each cheek: the French style I'd shown her.\
  \ \u2018So that\u2019s it. You\u2019re one of us.\u2019\n\nBack in Paris, I still\
  \ haven't come across any ghosts. But if I ever do, I now know how to whip them\
  \ up a plate of delicious pancit \u2013 the family recipe, of course."
