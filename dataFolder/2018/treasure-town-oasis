Text: "Driving east, the wind picks up and the air grows warmer as dust and sand whirl\
  \ around everything like a protective shield. Niland, CA isn\u2019t much to look\
  \ at; with an average population of about 1,000 people, it seems like a ghost town\
  \ in the hot summer days. Just across the railroad tracks, however, you can find\
  \ one of the most infamous squatter communities in the U.S. Slab City, a town whose\
  \ name from the concrete foundations that once supported Marine barracks during\
  \ WWII, is home to upwards of 6,000 residents in the winter months (primarily \u2018\
  snowbird\u2019 RVers migrating south from harsher climates) and less than 100 in\
  \ the summer months. Now, the foundations serve as parking spaces for winter residents,\
  \ and the dusty desert floor welcomes transient travelers and explorers. With no\
  \ electricity or running water, the area attracts people who want to explore living\
  \ off the grid, but also just people who want to get away from it all, with no rules\
  \ or regulation.\n\nIt soon became abundantly clear why the area is deserted in\
  \ the summer as the sun peeked its head above the hills, heating the red earth and\
  \ revealing structures dappling the rolling landscape. One aspect present in every\
  \ element of the scenery is creativity; the entire community is a work of art from\
  \ small shantis set up and built with materials that have been deposited or collected,\
  \ trees with shoes adorning them, and technicolor paintings on every surface. It\
  \ felt as though we had entered a storybook. Though the infrastructure was evidence\
  \ of life, the critters were all hiding under the rocks; the 111-degree dry heat\
  \ was not conducive to socializing. A quick self-guided tour quickly brought us\
  \ to the most well known structure on the land, Salvation Mountain. The love and\
  \ power of this place could be felt from the car as we pulled up in our Sedan.\n\
  \nSalvation Mountain was a labor of love constructed by Leonard Knight, a dedicated\
  \ Christian and artist who spent the last 30 years erecting this spectacular creation.\
  \ Clearly a sight to behold, this structure is what brings in most of the visitors\
  \ from around the world. It\u2019s a Dr. Seuss world of color and texture, where\
  \ cats climb rainbow trees made of adobied tires and branches. A spectacular example\
  \ of what dedication and love can inspire. Rearing it's vivacious head in the middle\
  \ of the desert landscape, Salvation Mountain breaks the monotony of the landscape\
  \ by proclaiming \"God Is Love\" and singing its sermon to the sun."
