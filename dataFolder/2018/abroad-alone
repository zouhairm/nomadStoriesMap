Text: For me it has  always been complicated to make connect with people. I try to
  leave my comfort zone every day, despite to my fears, weakness and how much I adore
  my home. Last summer I  - a girl who wants to prove she is deserve something in
  this huge world - went to greece alone, which I had never done until that moment.
  I did not realise it would be hard finding a conact with peple whose I have never
  met exactly on the other side of the world, different languge, different calture
  and   completely with unusual views to  human's lives. First week of doing nothing
  was incredible (I forfot telling that this girl is very lazy), beginning of the  Fourth
  worldwide war for me. There is a saying "Clothes make the man, which totally desribes
  me. I was in trouble every single day, I was depressed, I was in a mile to give
  up. I asked myself Why am I here? and I found the answer from myself, which was
  hidden deep inside me. I made myself to make a little step every day.  Working for
  whole weeks, intercommunicating with people from various parts of the world (I worked
  in the hotel restaurant as a waiter) I have opened myself, I break up myself. I
  competely realize how much it means to me to be part of the world, to be a human
  of the world. I realized my home is not the place where I was bornmy home is  the
  earth, my home is where I am and where my family, friends are. At this moment I
  know we do not have to be afraid to make mistakes, nobody judges us, to enjoy everyday
  life. All these human things makes us and who you are.
