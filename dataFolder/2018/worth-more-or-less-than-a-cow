Text: "Vi\xF1ales, Cuba is a small rural town located west of Havana in the Pinar\
  \ Del Rio province.  To some who have either visited or seen pictures, Vi\xF1ales\
  \ can almost immediately conjure images of breathtaking bright green palm tree laden\
  \ open pastures, distinctive grass covered rock formations, and brightly colored\
  \ wooden homes sparsely located amongst the well paved yet slightly less travelled\
  \ small town roads.  For me, who found myself on an epic journey through my mother\u2019\
  s homeland of Cuba, this was my utopian sanctuary. Perhaps because a journey to\
  \ this remote part of Cuba will not reveal an island aware of political changes,\
  \ hopes for \u201Cbetter tomorrow\u2019s\u201D nor any inkling of an upcoming potential\
  \ influx of American tourism. Or perhaps it spoke to my soul simply because like\
  \ the rest of Cuba, the island and its people are humble, straightforward and tirelessly\
  \ inspirational.  \n\nWe rented a car in Havana after having travelled the length\
  \ of the island from the southernmost tip to now the westernmost region. The roads\
  \ perfectly paved and easily navigable as we take our approximate two and a half\
  \ hour drive from Havana to Vi\xF1ales. We see a sign for a \u201CPaladar,\u201D\
  \ and stop along the road for lunch at a typical Vi\xF1ales colonial era home. Although\
  \ private restaurants are not yet an accepted practice in Cuba, the invitation to\
  \ ones home for a meal, is. Hence the advent of \u201CPaladares,\u201D an opportunity\
  \ for a Cuban home cooked meal in exchange for a fee. We are greeted by the eldest\
  \ daughter who directs us to a table in the corner of the deck. The options on the\
  \ menu are plentiful and typical to what I know of Cuban cooking \u2013 I order\
  \ the beef Ropa Vieja (translated as \u201Cold clothes\u201D). What I do not yet\
  \ know is that Beef is a great luxury in Cuba, and although this dish I recognize\
  \ as a favorite once enjoyed pre communism by my Cuban grandmother and mother -\
  \ it is now rarely, if ever, afforded by a Cuban residing in their own country.\
  \  \n\nMy husband, mother and I all speak fluent unaccented Spanish so our journey\
  \ is flavored with a slightly different taste than the typical tourist. My mother\
  \ speaks to the wife of the home about her youth in Cuba, and how this is her first\
  \ time visiting in 40 years. \u201CWe are here to return the ashes of my mother.\
  \ She was born in Cuba but never returned,\u201D my mother willingly shares with\
  \ the hostess. This immediately opens the doors to a different conversation, education\
  \ and experience with our farmer friends."
