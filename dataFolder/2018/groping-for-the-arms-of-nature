Text: "\u201CAre we going to bath here in public?!\u201D \nI asked my saggy-eyed friend,\
  \ to which she encouraged me with her tight cuddling grip that she kept holding\
  \ my hand as we climbed the average-height mountain to reach the falls of the Indonesian\
  \ village of Malino. This is my first time to climb a mountain, and somehow possess\
  \ the courage to bath in the open of nowhere.\n\nAt a short distance, under a waterfall\
  \ mouth, I glimpsed a naked muddy skinned man only covering what's between his thighs,\
  \ enjoying a quiet bath. Suddenly, I found the answer to my confusion as the small\
  \ village houses in the south of Sulawesi island are far from the water. Consequently,\
  \ no need for shyness to stop me from having a sweet bath in the paws of nature\
  \ sinking in the waterfall opened arms. Despite the frantic mind I took with me\
  \ from my homeland, I was excited about the new experience which eagerly supported\
  \ my trembling legs from the surprise of climbing a mountain. These vibes jumped\
  \ into my friend \u201CNia\u201D with her tender kakkawi face.\n\nMy mixed feelings\
  \ prompted me to secure my thoughts between two huge rocks of the waterfall. I guessed\
  \ that the space between them was enough for only one person which would, even partly,\
  \ help hiding the nudity of my shape. And piece by piece, I begun taking off my\
  \ clothes accompanied with the silent shadows of the rocks.\n\nI stand on a rug\
  \ ornamented with gravel clinging. The water is cold but you can see the scattered\
  \ flowers of the spring freely floating on. Their soft scent blows over my body.\
  \ The water has begun to do its course streaming down on the curves of my body as\
  \ gentle and peacefully as it can be, while the birds were chirping me the secrets\
  \ of this very pure spot of nature.\n\nNia\u2019s invitation to the tea fields,\
  \ the village is famous for, was waiting my shower to be over. The generous heart\
  \ of nature offers us two cups which we leisurely dipped. Nevertheless, I disturbed\
  \ this serenity by adding three tablespoons of sugar as I used to do back home.\
  \ I caught Nia\u2019s surprise with ironically truth about myself. Though there\
  \ might be many unnecessary contrasts between me and Mother Nature, but every cell\
  \ of my body will forever yearn for its embrace."
