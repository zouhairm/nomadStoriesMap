Text: "It was the spring of 2008 when my friends and I went on a trip to Thailand.\
  \ We went for 2 weeks and had incredible adventures. The temperature was above 100\
  \ degrees and I could not wait to see the ocean. Having arrived in our hotel we\
  \ headed to the beach. There we saw the jewel blue ocean with crystal clear water.\
  \ Swimming was awesome but we had to be careful to stay away from jelly fish that\
  \ was everywhere. Even on the beach they still had the potential to cause a painful\
  \ and even deadly sting but that did not stop us from swimming. Every day we enjoyed\
  \ delicious breakfast with exotic fruits and drinks waiting for us in the open-air\
  \ cafe with a great ocean view. First time I tried dragon fruit, mangosteen, guava,\
  \ pomelo, jackfruit, and lychees.\nA few days later we moved to the north near Chiang\
  \ Mai Province where we joined elephant tour in the wilderness. Riding an elephant\
  \ sounded like a once in a lifetime experience, so I could not wait to get my photo\
  \ riding on top of a massive elephant. So, we met our elephants and were ready for\
  \ the ride. Our elephant began walking slowly, and suddenly, we saw a river ahead\
  \ of us but our elephant did not seem to care and just walked into it.  As soon\
  \ as his feet touched the water he began splashing water on us. It was lots of fun.\n\
  Next adventure was ziplining in rainforest. I have never done it before, so my heart\
  \ sank when I saw a long zipline suspended high through the rainforest trees. We\
  \ were standing in line waiting for a couple in front of us to jump but their daughter\
  \ did not move, she was too scared. I could feel her heart and thought I should\
  \ not do it either. In a few minutes the girl finally hopped into the air screaming.\
  \ When my turn came I was standing on the edge of the cliff fearful to jump like\
  \ that little girl, so I told my friends not to wait for me. I knew I was not ready\
  \ to die yet. As I watched them flying I began feeling like a chicken. When they\
  \ finished I saw that girl walking smiling and happy. That\u2019s when I decided\
  \ to do it. I hopped into the air and soared like a bird. It was the best experience\
  \ I have ever had. When I did it I realized that it was not so scary after all and\
  \ felt proud of myself.                                                        \
  \                                        \nWinston Churchill said, \u201CFear is\
  \ a reaction. Courage is a decision.\u201D It was the decision that took me to the\
  \ edge and gave courage and confidence to stop being fearful and do what I thought\
  \ I could not."
