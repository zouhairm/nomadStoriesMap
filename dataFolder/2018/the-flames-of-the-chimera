Text: "The renowned southern heat, spiced up with 90% humidity, gave me the first\
  \ shock as I stepped out from my red-eye bus. I eagerly turned my steps to the beach.\
  \ A 15-minute stroll on a secluded path framed by lush foliage through the ruins\
  \ of a Hellenic city brought me to the Mediterranean Sea. Finally, there I was,\
  \ ready to quench my unabated curiosity to scout the lands that were once the abode\
  \ of the Greek gods and goddesses and now where modern hippies and bohemians bond,\
  \ in Olympos, Turkey.\n\nA few hours after the season\u2019s first dip in the sea,\
  \ I was already intermingling with other voyagers on the beach. Among them, a dreadlock-haired\
  \ guy asked from behind his John Lennon glasses: \n\n\u201CDo you guys want to walk\
  \ to the Yanartas (The Chimera)?\u201D\n\nI had been craving to see the flames of\
  \ the mythical beast Chimera, so I accepted his offer without bothering to hide\
  \ my excitement. After two hours hiking the mountain with my thin sole flip flops\
  \ under blistering southern heat, there I was to greet the fire-breathing monster\
  \ lying seven layers beneath my feet. \n\nThough science explains these flames as\
  \ the burning of methane gas, the stargazer in me wants to believe more in the story\
  \ of what the mythology books describe. Hence, I was in a state of awe when I finally\
  \ arrived to gaze upon the flames of the defeated Chimera buried under the mountain.\n\
  \nAs nightfall approached, we had to say goodbye to the Chimera. When we returned,\
  \ everyone was gathered around our beach fire, enjoying conversation accompanied\
  \ by the lulling waves of the Mediterranean. Sip by sip, the relaxation of red wine\
  \ was penetrating deeper and deeper down into my blood. I eventually surrendered\
  \ to the exhaustion and let my body sink down upon the hard beach stones. \n\nAmid\
  \ a peaceful sleep, I awoke suddenly to a piercing scream. \u201CWe\u2019re on fire!\u201D\
  \ As everyone was drifting into a state of unconsciousness blended with drunkenness,\
  \ no one bothered to extinguish the fire. As our bodies melted into rest, so too\
  \ did our blankets in the unattended flames. \n\nAt that point, I experienced various\
  \ feelings; anger from being awakened from my serene rest, and shock at the realization\
  \ of drifting to sleep on these hard rocks while the blanket was burning. But above\
  \ all, I remember that moment with an unexpected appreciation. \n\nWhat woke me\
  \ up that night was not a burning blanket blazed by the beach fire. It was the flames\
  \ of Chimera\u2026winking at me on my first-time visit to the land of the gods and\
  \ goddesses\u2026"
