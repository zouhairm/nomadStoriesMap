Text: "After four months studying in Chile, I found myself alone during Christmas\
  \ time. I decided it was time to explore more of South America. I packed my bag\
  \ on a whim and booked a flight ticket to Arica, in North Chile. From there, the\
  \ plan was to reach Arequipa, in Peru. To cross the Chilean border, the easiest\
  \ and cheapest way was to share a taxi to Tacna and then ride a bus to Arequipa.\n\
  \ \n As soon as I arrived at the taxi station, I realized I was absolutely cashless\
  \ and that there was no bank close by. I desperately explained the taxi driver my\
  \ situation but he kept on shaking his head to express his total objection. I was\
  \ about to cry and lose faith in human nature, when a tiny woman carrying very big\
  \ bags handed money to the driver. Vamos! -Let\u2019s go! She said while dragging\
  \ herself in the car. The driver looked at me and while rolling his eyes, he shouted\
  \ loudly at me: Pasa ! \u2013 Go. I entered, released but confused.\n \nThat\u2019\
  s how I met Maria.\n \nMaria was Peruvian, born and raised in Arequipa. Over the\
  \ two past years, she had been working in Chile; far away from her kids. I had no\
  \ other choice, she complained.\n \nMaria was small. She had big dark eyes and very\
  \ long dark shinning hair. She seemed to be in her fourthies.\n \nThe car was speeding\
  \ across a beautiful deserted no man\u2019s land; I opened the window and felt the\
  \ warm sandy air covering my face. I pulled out my camera and started taking pictures\
  \ of Maria.\n \nNo fotos ! No picture. She screamed.\n \nHer face had turned angry\
  \ red. I was melting inside. What would she react so violently? She urged me to\
  \ erase her pictures, witch I did, baffled. We continued the ride to the border\
  \ in complete silent.\nOnce in Tacna, she took care of everything. In few minutes\
  \ our trip to Arica was planned. Maria got into a big argument with the bus driver\
  \ who asked her to put her bags in the trunk. There was no way she could leave her\
  \ bags. The bus driver gave up.\n \n So there we were Maria, her bags and I on the\
  \ road again, heading to Arequipa. After nearly eight hours, the bus was reaching\
  \ its final destination. Maria give me tips to get around the city. Taxi driver\
  \ should not be trusted during the night. She really couldn\u2019t invite me to\
  \ her place and she was feeling very sorry for it. It\u2019s alright, I understand,\
  \ you have to be with your family. Pause. No, it\u2019s too dangerous. She looked\
  \ at me and opened her bag.\n \nIt was filled it up with cash. Thousands of bills\
  \ were lying there the whole time.\n \n Nothing else, but cash."
