Text: "On the road to Barreirinhas, Northern Brazil. After angry dogs and noisy Belem,\
  \ I am prepared to discover my top-destination in the Americas: the Len\xE7ois maranhenses\
  \ desert. \u201CDon\u2019t do that, it\u2019s too dangerous to go alone!\" Despite\
  \ the lack of preparation and the cautioning from locals, the call is strong enough.\
  \ Following a guided group of hysterical tourists is definitely not my cup of tea!\
  \ I want to experience this coastal desert on my own with Nature.\nI packed in a\
  \ 30 liter backpack with all the necessities for a 3-days trek: minimal food, light\
  \ camping stuff and clothes. No need to carry water as lagoons hatching every July\
  \ between dunes are freshwater. I enter in the desert from the beach strip towards\
  \ its unique oasis. I am not sure about the direction. Orienteering without a precise\
  \ map nor data is hazardous. I only rely on my compass and my lucky star. I am instantaneously\
  \ mesmerized by the large white dunes especially at dawn and dusk. The first attempt\
  \ to camp is harsh, with bursts of swirling winds. Impossible to anchor the tent\
  \ poles! I am not confident at all. In the morning, eyes still glued, I insist on\
  \ the direction of the hypothetical oasis. I cross multicolor lagoons or bypass\
  \ them when too deep. No landmark to keep azimuth. Anxiety and doubt are at climax.\
  \ At sunset I am still looking for a sheltered place. I have not seen any evidence\
  \ of the oasis. I cannot go back. At 360 degrees, a bicolor landscape as far as\
  \ your eyes can see, both inspiring and scary. A last search attempt gives me a\
  \ present: a tongue of sand between lagoons and high dunes, an idyllic place where\
  \ to rest. Wow! This sunrise is the cherry on the cake: unbelievable colors, mosaic\
  \ of clouds and it shadows on perfect dunes. In front of this unreal show of Nature\
  \ I cannot keep my tears. At this very moment I feel joy and a deep connection with\
  \ the surroundings, for the first time with this intensity. I found what I was pursuing\
  \ unconsciously. Shaken by this start, I keep on track and finally reach the desired\
  \ oasis, like if the green took control of the compass. Phew ! After one additional\
  \ day, and quicksand, bird attacks, mirages, paradise pools and adrenaline shots,\
  \ I could see the edge of the desert. \nWorth it! This extraordinary solo journey\
  \ was a strong personal experience stimulated by a magical scenery. Everyone can\
  \ experience adventure to his taste. In the distance I can see busy tourists taking\
  \ pictures of the Lagoa Azul. They are like ants on the dunes..."
