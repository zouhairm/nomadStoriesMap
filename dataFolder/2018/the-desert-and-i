Text: "Sweat is running down my forehead. One lonely drop of precious water is slowly\
  \ making its way towards my eyes, tickling my eyebrow on its way down till it evaporates\
  \ in the unforgiving heat. The Namibian sun is burning down on me tirelessly. All\
  \ I hear is the howling wind and my constant, rapid breathing. In and out, in and\
  \ out. The humidity in the air is near to zero, sucking all the moisture out of\
  \ my mouth. My tongue feels dry and furry.  I desperately want to drink but I only\
  \ have eight litres of water to last me for the day. Possibly for two.  Eight litres\
  \ of water for drinking, washing and cooking. Instead of drinking, my legs keep\
  \ on pedalling in unison with my breath. Up and down, up and down. The sandy road,\
  \ or whatever the Namibians call a road, is treacherous. My back wheel keeps sliding\
  \ menacingly to the sides, my legs pedalling as fast as the heat and exhaustion\
  \ would allow so I don\u2019t get stuck in the sand.   Bizarre mountain formation\
  \ along petrified sand dunes in the most intense shades of red pass by through the\
  \ shimmering heat and dust. But I barely notice it. I have fallen into a meditative\
  \ state of breathing and peddling. \u201CI hate sand, I hate sand\u201D, is my current\
  \ mantra. I\u2019m struggling with all the weight I\u2019ve packed on the back of\
  \ my bike. All my belongings \u2013 my entire life \u2013 in three make-do bags\
  \ I found three month ago in a supermarket in Nairobi. Three months and three thousand\
  \ kilometres ago. Right now, it feels more like a lifetime ago. For the thousands\
  \ time this day I wonder what got into me to cycle through half of Africa all the\
  \ way to Cape Town. Through the desolate and unforgiving desert of Namibia - on\
  \ a second-hand bike I found on the outskirts of Nairobi. In retrospect, the mountainous\
  \ roads around Kilimanjaro now seem like an easy treat. Out of nowhere, a pickup\
  \ overtakes me in frightful speed, interrupting my thoughts, leaving behind a cloud\
  \ of dust I cannot escape, wiping out the world around me. All is white. I try to\
  \ cover my mouth with a scarf and for an unforgivable second, I forget to pedal.\
  \ My wheels get stuck in the sand. In slow motion, the bike and I collapse into\
  \ the traitorous hot sand. All is quiet but my breath. I am too weak to push myself\
  \ and the bike back up. My eyes start to prickle with tears. Tears of exhaustion,\
  \ tears of frustration. Tears of precious water, slowly running down my sunburnt\
  \ cheeks, mingling with the sweat and the dust of the Namibian desert."
