Text: "I was a curious soul in the world's almost perfect City!!\nThe most accepting\
  \ yet she is of none.\nLike anyone I had the dream to experience Amsterdam.It was\
  \ a very spontaneous plan booked the Train from Bremen and the Bus in return (Yes\
  \ Flixbus)\nThis decision pushed me to the edge as it was going to change me as\
  \ a traveler.\nI almost miss the train cause of last-minute change in platform no.\
  \ well it wasn't done yet I had to catch a Bus then a Train to Amsterdam.\nThe view\
  \ of the River Amstel with Cruise carrying umpteen number of tourist and huge modern\
  \ building alongside those artistic buildings in the background is more than enough\
  \ of what you expect from a city.\nIt was like a blend of everything for me.\nThe\
  \ day began by taking 2 days local transport Pass for 12\u20AC,checked-in at WOW\
  \ Hostel.\nThe first thing was to visit the city by foot and the must see \"I am\
  \ Amsterdam \u201C, Anne Frank house, Zaanse schans, Heineken Museum, Flower Market\
  \ (Tulips) and the food street where the beer is cheap and the food even more cheaper\
  \ (Hot Pommes!!).\nWell the day 1 was like any tourist would want but I was Missing\
  \ on something and my heart was craving for more and I took a tram for the cruise\
  \ and then I saw an offer for Adam\u2019s Top Swing out of curiosity I booked and\
  \ this trip changed me from a traveler to explorer. The Open boat cruise with Adam\u2019\
  s Top swing costed me 24\u20AC it was a sunny day and the Amstel was calm started\
  \ from the main station the boat took us to smallest of canals with the view of\
  \ bridges old and new there was so much Love that can be felt from all around in\
  \ the midst of all the restaurant and air filled with weed the thrill had just began\
  \ after we go down and boarded a different Boat and went of the other side to Adam\u2019\
  s Top once you enter you can take a picture of your choice and then take an amazing\
  \ lift tour to the top.\nThe top of the building from where the entire city is visible\
  \ like the Eiffel tower of Amsterdam just that it is open the cold crisp wind hits\
  \ you from all the direction and the view made me realize that I am just a small\
  \ part of this Big world and it was so peaceful from the top that I can feel my\
  \ heartbeat. The moment I was at the swing where my feet\u2019s can feel the Air\
  \ and nothing and my eyes can\u2019t get enough of the city It was just me and my\
  \ thoughts \u201CI want to see more or this world even if I Miss a part or two I\
  \ want to live in the very moment, Breath and Explore\u201D.\n Sometimes it\u2019\
  s not about Travelling but it's about finding \u201CYourself\u201D."
