Text: "Civitanova is an Italian city, where the morning calmness and evening passion\
  \ change one another among the bright starts and gentle breeze. That hot summer\
  \ day, I with my friends, Julie and Zhanna were lucky to get on the festival named\
  \ \"Vita, vita!\" after a tiring day of endless trip by train. \"But what are we\
  \ celebrating?\" I asked the old couple passing me by. \"Life!\" , they said. It\
  \ was the last thing that I expected to hear. \nThat cool summer evening was full\
  \ of different sounds, like tango, jazz, rock, ska, clinking of glasses and loud\
  \ talks. No, it's not just the sound, it's a life lived in a music sheet. Zhanna\
  \ (our goddess of dance), was dancing tango with one Italian signore and her eyes\
  \ were shining as never before. Julie was attached to a mime's charming story, he\
  \ had a big smile but sad eyes. I was enjoying the fire show by two circus performers,\
  \ who lighted up the crowd's hearts. In spite of the age difference, problems, misunderstandings,\
  \ these crowd's hearts were living the same moment. The moment of life. You feel\
  \ it and taste it. The Italians know how enjoy the life. Now we know this simple\
  \ thing too. \nThe festival of Life refreshed our bodies and souls. Civitas from\
  \ Latin means \"city\", nova - ''new'', Civitanova - a symbolic name for our new\
  \ story. That was a day of our own renaissance in the 21st century."
