Text: "Transcending into restless insanity, I sat, crumpled like a trodden soft-drink\
  \ can. Six traumatising hours into a four-hour bus commute between Bali\u2019s Nusa\
  \ Penida and Gilimanuk ferry terminal, I began to sincerely doubt my arrival in\
  \ Java before my flight. With my breathe, I replenished the opaque circle of condensation\
  \ on my passenger window, the momentary transparency during my inhalation revealed\
  \ a landscape inundated with rice-fields. Dotted amongst the flooded countryside,\
  \ were villagers tending to the grass, their conical hats appeared like barnacles\
  \ floating upon a sea of tussocked green. \nTo divert my attention from the elongated\
  \ minutes that comprised the further two hours I had to travel, I contorted my body\
  \ as to assess the people that were confined to the same claustrophobic space I\
  \ was. Filtering through their faces, I recognised the Frenchman from the bus terminal.\
  \ No later than two seconds after our eyes met, the engine beneath us coughed and\
  \ sighed. \n\u201CAH PUTAIN\u201D I jested.\n\nPerched against a gutter by the side\
  \ of the road, he approached me. He complimented my selective French and introduced\
  \ me to a few more phrases I might utilise. His English was broken, but the way\
  \ he pronounced our words was beautiful. He announced himself as Andre, and explained\
  \ that he was a seventy-year-old Frenchman, travelling the world without plans.\
  \ I asked where he was staying in Java; he informed me that he didn\u2019t know.\
  \ I thought to myself \u201CI should have seen that coming.\u201D\n\nWhen I asked\
  \ him why he was travelling, he tarried. His pause was weighted with raw emotion,\
  \ the kind that you can intrinsically sense. He eventually articulated through sharp\
  \ sentences that his wife had recently passed away, and that the absence of her\
  \ had broken his heart. He confessed to suppressing his pain and succumbing to a\
  \ dark place. After months of mourning, his children finally suggested he should\
  \ find something to occupy the time he had left, so, in response to their advice,\
  \ he had packed a bag and booked a one-way flight. He joked about how his children\
  \ think he has descended into madness and call every night to make sure he is still\
  \ alive. \nAndre looked at me for a short while, seeming like he was on the verge\
  \ of tears. By then I had settled into a deep silence, sobered by the words he had\
  \ entrusted me with. Not once did I divert my eyes from Andre - I was fixated by\
  \ him, by story that was unfurling before me. The last thing I expected, escaped\
  \ his lips-\n\n\u201CYou remind me of her.\u201D"
