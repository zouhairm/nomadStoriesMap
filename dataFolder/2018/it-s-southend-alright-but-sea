Text: "I looked out the window. Sheep on the left, sail boat masts on the right. I\
  \ had left the city. I could hear the steel cables clattering like a hundred metal\
  \ robins when the train doors opened.\n\nI was following the path of Victorian Londoners\
  \ travelling to their nearest seaside resort, Southend-on-Sea, to enjoy a day away\
  \ from the hustle. A healthy level of optimism helps when enjoying the English summer\
  \ as the sun tends to drop-in for an afternoon-tea rather than stay for the whole\
  \ garden party while the wind does it's best to make it feel like early spring again.\
  \ My expectations were measured: a beach to fly my kite, a local chippy for dinner\
  \ and, well, the sea, for gazing faraway and the sorts.\n\nThe palm-lined promenade\
  \ with its few ambling people and shrieking seagulls almost detracted from the gaping\
  \ error in the picture. Nobody seemed to notice. I have to admit, I was discombobulated.\
  \ No article or entry about this dormant resort mentioned this. It was certainly\
  \ the last thing I expected.\n\nI could find the chippies, and the wind was uncomfortably\
  \ keen. Even the sun shimmered through. Yet, where there should have been Southend-on-Sea\
  \ there was only Southend-on-Mud. The water was gone. \n\nFishing boats and cutters\
  \ lay capsized like marine sprinkles on a silt tart. Scanning the horizon searching\
  \ for the water, I noticed large industrial structures on the other shore. A rugged\
  \ silhouette of immense silos and tall chimneys reminded of a very different era\
  \ that dominated the town's history more recently than the romanticism of Victorian\
  \ England.\n\nI was intrigued and started noticing the ornamental balconies and\
  \ facades towering behind a row of pubs and colourful video game arcades all along\
  \ the main seafront. Leading the way to Adventure Island, a modest fun park, I couldn't\
  \ help but feel nostalgia for a bygone decade when teenagers spent their pocket\
  \ money on hairspray and Prince records. But somehow that decade seemed to have\
  \ arrived here 20 years too late and wondered what iPhone and Netflix were. \u201C\
  Is it always this quiet in June?\u201D I ask the girl at the sweets stand. Her nail\
  \ polish matched the cotton candy that framed her in the little wooden cubicle.\
  \ \u201COh yeah. This is main season.\u201D she said with the long vowels of the\
  \ Essex accent.\n\nThe horizon dissolved into an educated guess in the distance\
  \ as the colours drowned in the haze of dusk. Curious, I thought, as time retreated\
  \ like the tide, it revealed such unexpected character in the sediment."
