Text: "I was twenty-eight. He was forty.\n\nI was wearing my nicest dress. He was\
  \ wearing a cardigan that looked like something my friend\u2019s grandfather would\
  \ wear.\n\nHe was the silent type. Silence made me uncomfortable.\n\n\u2018Why did\
  \ you become a teacher?\u2019 I asked him.\n\n\u2018My childhood was very grey.\
  \ I want to make colour in the lives of children,\u2019 he replied in surprisingly\
  \ good English.\n\nHe grew up in a country rebuilding itself after the destruction\
  \ of war. \n\nI grew up in the suburbs of Melbourne, in a three bedroom grey brick\
  \ house with white colonial shutters.\n\nWe met in a bar in Daehangno, Seoul\u2019\
  s theatre district, just thirty kilometres from the Demilitarised Zone, the world\u2019\
  s most heavily armed border. \n\n I drank wine, he drank soju and whisky.\n\n\u2018\
  What do you think of Korea?\u2019 he asked, drawing back on his cigarette.\n\n\u2018\
  I love it!\u2019 I replied.\n\nI was excited by a city that never slept, intoxicated\
  \ by the neon lights and high-rise buildings yet calmed by the surrounding mountains\
  \ and temples. The department stores and boutiques of Apgujeong seduced me with\
  \ their display of wealth and beauty making it hard to imagine that Korea was once\
  \ considered one of the poorest nations in the world.\n\nHe raised his eyebrows\
  \ in response, \u2018Life here is too hard, I work too much.\u2019\n\n\u2018What\
  \ did you do when you left school?\u2019 he asked, flicking his hair and leaning\
  \ back in his chair.\n\nI told him I studied dance and travelled around Europe.\n\
  \nHe told me that South Korean law requires every man between the age of eighteen\
  \ and thirty-five to enter mandatory military service. \n\nAt school I learnt about\
  \ the Vietnam War, the bombing of Pearl Harbour and the Holocaust. There was no\
  \ mention of the Korean War or the two million civilians and soldiers that were\
  \ killed. Also not mentioned was the starvation and torture of Koreans or the families\
  \ divided, never to be reunited.\n\n\u2018Do you feel unsafe living so close to\
  \ the border?\u2019 I asked him.\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders. \u2018That is our\
  \ life.\u2019\n\nWe met again the following week and a few weeks after that. \n\n\
  He taught me to slurp noodles from my bowl.\n\nI taught him to relax and made him\
  \ watch Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s at the local DVD room.\n\nHe asked me to be\
  \ his girlfriend. \n\nI said \u2018yes\u2019.\n\nEleven years later Donald Trump\
  \ is elected president of the United States. He threatens North Korea and imposes\
  \ stricter sanctions. The North retaliates with the testing of missiles and threats\
  \ of nuclear weapons. \n\nI ask Young-jin if he feels unsafe.\n\nHe says \u2018\
  yes.\u2019"
