Text: "Amiens, France\n2015\nIt\u2019s not without merit that travel is hailed as\
  \ one of the greatest teachers. A travel tale set in frosty France, on the way back\
  \ from a visit to the City of Love- Paris, ended up teaching me a lesson in love,\
  \ like never before. Not romantic love, not love of friends and family, but a simpler,\
  \ yet greater love for and from another human being. An incorrectly read train schedule,\
  \ left a friend and I stranded 300 miles from our university town Lille and another\
  \ 600 odd miles away from Paris. The clock struck 8 in the night, the train station\
  \ waved a farewell to its last departure till 5 next morning and the infamous grey\
  \ winters of France welcomed us. \nSurely we could find a bus right? no! A cab?\
  \ no! A hotel? no! A hostel? no! Because when Murphy\u2019s Law strikes, it decides\
  \ to settle scores it seems. A small, sleepy town was especially busy so close to\
  \ Christmas and was running over and above its tourist holding capacity. So, were\
  \ we to spend a cold night at the train station? All the \u2018Parisian croissants\
  \ and cheese\u2019 from earlier in the day were not enough to grant the God-like\
  \ endurance levels required for that and so we decided to explore the central square\
  \ for hotel rooms on foot.\nJust when we thought having a \u2018Castaway-ish\u2019\
  \ night was our only bet, an Afro-French guy with an amiable faced beamed down at\
  \ us from a hotel reception. Playing dumb charades and \u2018Google Translat\u2019\
  -ing, he managed to explain to us that he was French citizen, settled in Africa,\
  \ an \u2018\xE9tudiant\u2019 (student), working part-time on a night shift in Amiens.\
  \ And while the hotel was full, he would be happy to offer us the makeshift bed\
  \ arrangement the hotel provides him. Not only that, he offered us a dinner on the\
  \ house, tea at regular intervals, a scrawny rug (his only possession to keep him\
  \ warm other than his jacket), all the while running the risk of violating hotel\
  \ policy. \nWhen we finally had to depart the next morning, and we offered him money\
  \ for all the help, he managed to say something (in broken English) to the effect\
  \ of:\n\n\u201CNo money, I an \u2018\xE9tudiant\u2019, seen tough days when studying.\
  \ You students too! Me help you is God\u2019s wish. When I come to India, show me\
  \ your country, that my thank you!\u201D\n\nWith a tear in my eye and a radiant\
  \ smile on my lips, that right there became my favorite postcard from the student\
  \ backpacking trip in Europe; a \u2018lecon de amour\u2019 to be cherished forever."
