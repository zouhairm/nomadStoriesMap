Text: "Americans talk about Nicaragua as if it's a novel destination. So what are\
  \ American ruins doing in the middle of the Nicaraguan jungle? In 2016, I was living\
  \ in Siuna, a remote town 9 hours northeast of the capital via chicken bus, researching\
  \ a novel. A local university professor, Luis Herrera Siles, invited me to see the\
  \ ruins of a hydroelectric dam that La Luz Mines Limited, an American and Canadian-owned\
  \ company, had built during World War II. The dam powered the 2000-foot-deep gold\
  \ mine in Siuna, then the richest in Latin America, and supplied electricity to\
  \ the town, including my mother\u2019s childhood home. Luis and I set off at 5 a.m.\
  \ in his pickup. We drove for two hours through rolling green hills, the occasional\
  \ Cort\xE9s cedar a brilliant jolt of gold against the green. After a stop for quesillo\u2014\
  ropy, homemade cheese in a warm tortilla\u2014we came to the literal end of the\
  \ road at Campo Dos and mounted horses. It had rained recently; with each step our\
  \ horses sank up to their knees in the bright orange mud. During the dam's heyday,\
  \ Luis said, the land between Campo Dos and the retaining wall had been flooded\
  \ into an artificial lake. What had been a short journey via boat took us two hours.\
  \ The retaining wall, overgrown with vines and foliage, looked a thousand years\
  \ old instead of fifty. Half of it was missing, having washed away in 1968 after\
  \ days of heavy rains, ending operations at the mine and plunging the town into\
  \ poverty. Luis had seen the wall before, but this time he wanted to find the old\
  \ machine house, where the dam\u2019s sluices and turbines were controlled. We remounted\
  \ and headed uphill through dense jungle, crossing shallow creeks and avoiding hanging\
  \ vines until we came to a pair of rusted four-foot-diameter metal drainage pipes\
  \ shooting downhill to the Yy river. These pipes had traveled via steamboat from\
  \ New Orleans to the Caribbean port of Prinzapolka, then upriver by barge before\
  \ being hauled here over land. We followed the pipes uphill and found it: a half-collapsed\
  \ two-story cement structure. We climbed over the crumbling outer walls. Luis spotted\
  \ something and hurried forward: a wheel attached to a long steel rod that ran through\
  \ a complicated series of cogs and gears. They had once determined the fate of a\
  \ mine that produced $22 billion in gold. Now they rusted in the grass. Here I was,\
  \ as far into the interior of Nicaragua as it\u2019s possible to go, only to find\
  \ the heavy footprint of the country  I'd left behind."
