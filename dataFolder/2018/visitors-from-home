Text: "Brakes slam.  I stare at a co-pilot whose outburst halted our momentum.  I\
  \ check the rearview mirror. The closest car is a dot on the horizon. The two-lane\
  \ highway through ramshackle towns is decorated with buildings leaning so low they\
  \ seem a continuation of the overgrown trees surrounding them. The thermometer reads\
  \ 32. \n\n\u201CTurn around!  We\u2019ve been looking all day!\u201D \n\nThe dilapidated\
  \ building faces the highway beneath a gray sky.  This area where winding roads\
  \ hide smoked meats and the kind of tea so sweet it curls your lips, I tried to\
  \ get out almost as long as it took me to grow up. It seems that even if you shake\
  \ the dust of your roots from your feet, you can\u2019t always shake it from within.\
  \  On this January day, my soul needed some South.\n\nA man approached. \u201CWhatchu\
  \ ladies doin' here?\u201D \n\n\u201CWe saw your sign, but if you\u2019re not open\
  \ it\u2019s fine\u2026.\u201D I trail off, turning to move towards the car.  It\u2019\
  s not the season anyway.  The fresh, green shells only in season May through November.\
  \  Undaunted, my companion interjects, \u201CListen, my friend is from here, but\
  \ hasn\u2019t had any in years. Please?\u201D \n\nHe responds in a drawl I\u2019\
  ve been gone long enough to notice. \u201CTake a minute to heat up.  Mind waitin\u2019\
  ?\u201D\n\nWe walk into the building with a low ceiling decorated with even lower\
  \ branches reaching from it.  I stumble over my own self-importance. I grew up here,\
  \ after all.  Worked hard to shed the attitudes and notions of a childhood grown\
  \ from a land crossed with vines that barely cover the open wounds and staunch belief\
  \ in a history that so strongly defines it. My brain has filled in the blanks though\
  \ we\u2019ve barely spoken.  He interrupts my assumptions.  \n\n\u201CYou ladies\
  \ caught me just in time.  Twenty years in this place and I\u2019m finally headin'\
  \ out. Movin\u2019 to Ecuador.\u201D \n\nI stare at him while we wait, he holds\
  \ cheese squares in flimsy plastic for the animal begging at his feet on a wooden\
  \ floor with the scars of time scratched upon it. \n\n\u201CBeen visitin\u2019 for\
  \ near ten years.  Time to make it permanent.  Been in this dump long enough.\u201D\
  \ His attention shifts back to his feet and a piece of cheese is relinquished. A\
  \ timer dings. A plastic bag of steaming peanuts emerge. He tells us to look him\
  \ up if we\u2019re ever in Ecuador and I wonder when I forgot that prejudice is\
  \ the same regardless of how it\u2019s wrapped.  My arrogance slips. \n\nWe drive\
  \ away.  Shells hot, I suck briny liquid off salted legumes.  My teeth sink into\
  \ tender, boiled bean. Nostalgia and grace roll on my tongue."
