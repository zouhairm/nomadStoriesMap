Text: "In my teens I read a book where the story was going on in Ireland, and from\
  \ there began to grow within me an immense desire to know this country. I remember\
  \ that at the time Ireland was not one of the favorite destinations of students\
  \ and travelers, but it had become mine!\nI dreamed of the day that I could know\
  \ that country, but at that moment this seemed impossible, because it was a very\
  \ expensive trip and I did not have the financial conditions at that time to pay\
  \ for such a trip. \nThe years went by and my desire to go there only increased,\
  \ and I continued to say to myself that I would still fulfill this dream.\nOne day\
  \ at my job there was a selection for an internship at a foreign university and\
  \ I could not believe I was selected!\nThere were no opportunities for Ireland,\
  \ but I would go to England and know that from there it would be easy for me to\
  \ go to Ireland.\nI finished my internship and the big day arrived. I embarked for\
  \ the Emerald Isle, as Ireland is known.\nWhen I stepped on Irish land my heart\
  \ raced, for I have lived for years waiting for this day to come and it has arrived!\n\
  I stayed there for a week, but it was long enough to be even more enchanted with\
  \ that country. I knew beautiful places, breathtaking landscapes, medieval castles\
  \ that seemed to exist only in movies.\nIts capital Dublin is rich in cultures,\
  \ as people reside from various places in the world, in addition it is a vibrant\
  \ and jovial city. During the day the city offers countless leisure options such\
  \ as: museums, parks, theme coffees and the night wins its charm in the various\
  \ Pubs.\nBeyond the capital, I met other towns and small villages where Gaelic was\
  \ still the official language. This time I spent there I was able to enjoy lush\
  \ landscapes and natural beauty, from cliffs, castles to quiet and charming farms\
  \ with their sheep grazing in the countryside.\nIreland really is a country rich\
  \ in cultures, flavors, traditions and natural beauties. It really was how I imagined\
  \ it and more!"
