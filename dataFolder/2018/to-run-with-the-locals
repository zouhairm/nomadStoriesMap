Text: "I looked out into the sun-lit spectacle of banners and flags flying in the\
  \ spring breeze as spectators excitedly enclosed the school track field. Five learners\
  \ crouched behind the starting line as a familiar but unknown language boomed over\
  \ the speakers. It grew louder; parents and teachers grew more excited; and suddenly,\
  \ the gun went off. The learners sprinted, with random parents and teachers leaping\
  \ into the race and taking hold of a learner\u2019s hand as they all ran the race\
  \ of their lives. I stood on the side lines, waiting, hoping, to also take the plunge.\n\
  A year on and I was attending my second Sports Day at Namwon Elementary School.\
  \ Still the foreign English teacher cluelessly cheering on a peculiar contest. True,\
  \ I no longer got stares when disembarking from my daily bus ride or walking the\
  \ streets of the tangerine rich southern village of Jeju Island, but I was still\
  \ a waygookin. After all, it didn\u2019t take much to stand out in South Korea,\
  \ one of the most homogenous countries in the world. Yet, Namwon also had that quaint\
  \ village quality of everyone knowing everything about everyone, detecting any newcomers\
  \ into the communal fold. But things were about to change. I was going to run.\n\
  Another announcement and another crop of learners made their way to the starting\
  \ line. I could feel my heart pumping as the gun went off, watching closely as the\
  \ learners slowly made their way around the track. The voice on the loud speakers\
  \ kept shouting as adults darted into the race from the side lines. But one learner\
  \ kept running by herself. I breathed in deeply and as she approached I leaped in,\
  \ grabbing her hand to run together. Out of the corner of my eye I saw teachers,\
  \ parents and even my principal shouting and cheering us on. We passed the finish\
  \ line and I was panting hard, despite not running the full distance.\nWhen I looked\
  \ up, a group of sixth graders were mischievously smiling at me. Then I saw my co-teacher\
  \ running towards me from across the field.\n\u201CNoku! Noku! Did you understand\
  \ anything?\u201D She asked, her eyes swimming with laughter.\n\u201CHonestly? No.\
  \ I just wanted to join in.\u201D\n\u201CThe learners had to find a running partner\
  \ who had attended this school,\u201D she exclaimed. \u201CI was so shocked when\
  \ I saw you running. Now the third graders think you attended Namwon as a kid!\u201D\
  \nI was mortified as my co-teacher endearingly laughed at me. But just then, I felt\
  \ a tap on my shoulder, and turned to face my fellow running mate, who simply smiled\
  \ at me and said, \u201Cthank you.\u201D"
