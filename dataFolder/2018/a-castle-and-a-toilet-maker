Text: "My most important, transcendent recommendation for any prospective visitor\
  \ to Japan: Use the bidets. Use as many as you can. Vary the strength and temperature\
  \ of the water. Play the sounds of babbling brooks and birds of the forest. Make\
  \ sure your accommodation comes fully equipped with a \u201Cshower toilet\u201D\
  . But be aware: if you do this you run a very real risk of being unable and unwilling\
  \ to ever leave your hotel washroom.\n\nIt was with immeasurable strength of will,\
  \ therefore, that I lifted myself from the fully-equipped throne in my Nagoya hotel\
  \ room to visit the city\u2019s historic castle.  \n\nAt the entrance, I was stopped\
  \ by a man in glasses and a blue vest; a free tour guide. He held out a clipboard\
  \ with some pictures. He pointed to an image of a familiar, porcelain fixture and\
  \ said: \u201CHave you tried a shower toilet?\u201D\n\nHave I? Tried a shower toilet?\
  \ Is the Pope Catholic!\n\nOsamu then made his big reveal. For forty years he had\
  \ worked at Toto, one of Japan\u2019s bidet duopoly. He had risen the ranks in their\
  \ manufacturing sector here in Nagoya. He was recently retired, and in his spare\
  \ time opted to come and give tours \u2013 entirely without charge and, he assured\
  \ us, not even for a tip \u2013 because of a love of his city and its history that\
  \ he wished to share with visitors. \n\nI was in awe. I wasn\u2019t just getting\
  \ a tour; I was meeting the maker. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a tour of the castle, not\
  \ really. He\u2019d stop and give some interesting facts as we walked through the\
  \ space \u2013 how, for example, the height of the art on the waiting room walls\
  \ corresponded to the class of samurai that would sit there. But I learned other\
  \ things. He asked what would happen if I, an Australian, wanted to change jobs.\
  \ I said something about interviews and resumes, about how you could move fairly\
  \ easily between companies. Not so in Japan, Osamu says. If he jumped ship to Toto\u2019\
  s rival, he wouldn\u2019t have been in Kansas anymore; he\u2019d have to start from\
  \ the bottom, work another forty years. Loyalty was and remains a substitute for\
  \ experience. \n\nMy time with the toilet maker was up. It was beginning to rain.\
  \ I offered to lead him back to the entrance under my umbrella but he refused. I\u2019\
  d hardly gotten wet before he was already chatting with another nearby visitor,\
  \ as eager to share with them what he had with me. To be frank, Nagoya Castle's\
  \ nothing special. But there\u2019s only one Osamu. Just remembering his generosity\
  \ of spirit warms me still, much like the perfectly heated jet of my hotel shower\
  \ toilet."
