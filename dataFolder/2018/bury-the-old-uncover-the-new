Text: "Tired legions of Roman soldiers seek refuge from the mid-day summer sun. Their\
  \ journey westward has brought them to a broad grassland, a wide river ribboning\
  \ through its heart. The emperor who sent them to explore this land has offered\
  \ a promise \u2013 establish a great city, and you may retire there. \nThis army,\
  \ the army of Augustus, has seen many lands during its illustrious career, but chooses\
  \ to settle in this place, this southern corner of the continent they rule. The\
  \ capital city will bear the name of the people themselves \u2013 Emerita Augusta,\
  \ the city of Augustus\u2019 soldiers.\nThe city blooms with Roman art and architecture.\
  \ Soon gladiator fights fill the stands of an amphitheater, and aqueducts sprout\
  \ like the flowers they feed with precious water.\nPower sees many new faces, and\
  \ the Romans later must surrender their city. The Visigoths inherit this new home\
  \ and leave behind their places of worship for posterity to ponder. They too later\
  \ concede their city, this time to a new religion challenging the temples and churches.\n\
  The Moors of North Africa pass under the Arch of Trajan, marking the entrance to\
  \ this former Roman city. As a symbol of new power, they construct a fortress reusing\
  \ Roman and Visigoth walls. \nLeaders rise and fall, and again the keys to the city\
  \ gates change hands.\nThis place is now part of a powerful global empire. The citizens\
  \ now call themselves by a new name \u2013 espa\xF1oles; the people of Spain, living\
  \ in the city of M\xE9rida.  \nToday, the streets that have witnessed over two-thousand\
  \ years of empires welcome visitors to explore the vibrant past.\nI arrive to the\
  \ city as hopeful explorers once did. Passing through modern neighborhoods and admiring\
  \ new buildings, I cross a bridge not much older than I am. \nThe structures become\
  \ progressively more ancient \u2013 convents, then temples, then statues, then stones.\
  \ The city\u2019s timeline is a walking trail. \nAs I near the heart of the Roman\
  \ ruins, a man walks out of a simple apartment building. Despite the building\u2019\
  s plain exterior, a sign identifies it as an archaeological interpretation center.\
  \ \nThe man invites me in to view the excavation, through a doorway to the buried\
  \ past. He is a restorer of art, and he motions to a Roman mosaic he has uncovered.\
  \ \nThe once-vibrant colors are dull and dust-covered.\nI note how harmoniously\
  \ the unique pieces still fit together, despite the battering of time. My guide\
  \ picks up a brush, clearing away the dirt to reveal a revived work of art.  \n\u201C\
  Isn\u2019t it beautiful?\u201D"
