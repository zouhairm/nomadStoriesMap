Text: "My left knee was inches from the bus. I tried to move away, but my right leg\
  \ was too close to the pickup in the next lane. It didn\u2019t matter. An instant\
  \ later we were swerving past the bus and heading behind a delivery truck. Then\
  \ my motorcycle taxi driver took a phone call without slowing down.\nIt was gridlock\
  \ in Bangkok, and I was on the back of a tiny Honda Click 125. If I lived through\
  \ this, it would be the story of the trip. Right now living felt like a big \u201C\
  if.\u201D\nSometimes \u201Cdon\u2019t try this at home\u201D is as much an invitation\
  \ as a warning. I only had one day to photograph a temple 13 km away from our hotel.\
  \ Traffic was at a standstill, and the only way across the sprawling core of Bangkok\
  \ was this motorcycle.\nMost moto-taxi drivers serve a relatively small area. Rides\
  \ are a few baht for a few blocks. I was asking for the moon to hurry to a temple\
  \ across town. My phone with the temple name on screen was passed around among the\
  \ taxi drivers, each pointing emphatically. They all pointed in different directions.\
  \ \nConsensus was reached and we were off. I risked a glance up through the concrete\
  \ mangrove tangle of walkways, pedestrian bridges and train platforms wrapped over\
  \ and around each other in the smoggy air.\nWe swung between lanes, hunting forward\
  \ for our next opening. This guy was all-pro. I could tell by how he handled the\
  \ bike, and the fact he was still alive. More than 17,500 people die on motorcycles\
  \ in Thailand yearly, a rate four times that of traffic death in the US. This ride\
  \ felt like subtle suicide.\nIt was bus, truck, bus, then gas it quick between two\
  \ cars. Weaving, snaking forward on the centerline, leaning left, then hard on the\
  \ brakes as another scooter beats us to our gap. Knuckles go white on the grab handles\
  \ and abs clench.\nThe glint of a dim sun filters down from pollution-caked glass,\
  \ but my attention snaps back to the street. I have to work for this. Leaning with\
  \ my driver could be the difference between slipping past a truck and ending up\
  \ under it.\nHoning in on the temple is a gradual process. It takes a mango vendor,\
  \ a pizza delivery motorcycle driver and a guard at the wrong temple to sort it\
  \ out. After the last turn my driver and I spot the gleaming spire at the same instant,\
  \ shouting and pointing together in a shared moment of victory and relief. \nThe\
  \ ride over, my driver eases off wearily into the ceaseless flow of the city. I\
  \ stop to collect myself. I may have just gotten to the temple, but I have been\
  \ praying for quite a while."
