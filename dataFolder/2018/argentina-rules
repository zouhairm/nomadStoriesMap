Text: "Someone once said that Buenos Aires is the South American Paris. I have heard\
  \ so many things about Buenos Aires.\n\nBarrilete c\xF3smico, la pulga, el piojo,\
  \ la brujita, el p\xE1jaro...they have nicknames for everyone and everything. You're\
  \ a \"negro cabeza\" even if you're white but you sound a bit like an asshole, and\
  \ you can be a jerk without necessarily being an idiot. Chab\xF3n, guachin, tenaza,\
  \ and above all the word friend, because they all say they are friends, even if\
  \ they want to afanar (snatch) your belongings. Hey friend, do you have some pesos\
  \ to spare for the bondi? Argentinians even have a \"friend's day\" and they go\
  \ out to celebrate it. An ode camaraderie, where they often ask between themselves:\
  \ \xBFqu\xE9 onda tu onda?\n\_\nAnd they all are a bit psychologists. Master, capo,\
  \ maestro... they have a name for everything. And when you come around we can prepare\
  \ a barbecue, asado for them. That amazing encounter that everybody who has spent\
  \ some time in this beloved country now how special it can be, because everyone\
  \ knows that there is no meat like Argentinian meat: colita de cuadril, ojo de bife,\
  \ patita de pernil, a chori for each of the presents; and we should not forget about\
  \ the kingdom of the milanga, besides the milonga (which is an entirely different\
  \ thing) How do you want it? Napolitana, a la pizza, a caballo. And yes, it always\
  \ comes with French fries.\n\nThere are coins that no one knows what they are for,\
  \ and 2 pesos bills that you don\u2019t want to touch after washing your hands.\
  \ Do you remember there was a time when 1 peso was equivalent to 1 dollar? That\
  \ good old days!\n\nThere are dieguitos and mafaldas, famous phrases of Borges,\
  \ some texts written by Cort\xE1zar and some Pizarnik for rainy days. People listen\
  \ to Spinetta, everyone knows about Calamaro and Fito\u2019s loveaffairs, as they\
  \ have sung \u201Cel amor despues del amor\u201D, \u201CPaloma\u201D,  and so on,\
  \ as Charly Garc\xEDa taught them. When they are not dancing a tango and remembering\
  \ the fact that Gardel was born on their side of the river and not in Uruguay as\
  \ evil tongues say. \n\nTo wrap up I would say there is still a lot to do, like\
  \ recover the Malvinas islands, and between mate and mate, you can have some sweet\
  \ pastry, and if you prefer a different choice you have the famous \u201Cpepas\u201D\
  , that in addition to being the nickname of Josefa, is also a delicious cookie with\
  \ strawberry jam. Someone has just turned on the TV and you can find colorful characters\
  \ like Lanata, Tinelli, and Kaczka. What a wonderful ride! See you later!"
