Text: "When did you pray for the last time? In autumn? It's summer now.\n\nThe road.\n\
  \n Chained to the road, the wheels are rolling up into the infinity. The voices\
  \ are melting among the scorched reach of rocks. Like powdered sugar, they are crumbling.\
  \ And like a cinnamon's syrup, they are spreading.\nWe are riding through the route\
  \ 66. It's twisting and jumping somewhere in the shadow. It's shaking off its old\
  \ skin and inhaling spicy heat of the wilderness. Green wilderness.\n Made of stone,\
  \ hewed into shape, hanging over the abbys, figures of the ancient gods. Their entangled\
  \ beards are rhythmically swaying under the breath of the wind. The mumbling of\
  \ the sleepy lips interlaced with the mantra of rain spirits. Crossroads dissects\
  \ scattered settlement of the lost tribe.\n Along the road arising tiny wooden houses\
  \ with somewhat faded signboards. The roar of the motor awakens their inhabitants.\
  \ Someone friendly invites you to drink a pint of beer or play cards. Somebody,\
  \ vice versa, hides eyes under the brim of broad hats or is scaryly looking at strangers\
  \ through the window shutter.\n It seems that a sheriff will get out from that pub\
  \ in a minute, squeaking the spurs. He will screw up his eyes, observing the territory.\
  \ None tumbleweed won't escape from his intent look.\n\nNavajo's land.\n\n Moving\
  \ forward. The summit of forests is covered with rainy clouds. Spires of pine trees\
  \ are propping them up and hardly restraining. You can hear the cry of an eagle,\
  \ like a call of forefathers.\nJust an one turn of the sun and you can not keep\
  \ your eyes open anymore. The flame-red dragon appeares above the horizon. Grand\
  \ Canyon. The beauty, charm and greatness captivates and incinerates you. It takes\
  \ your breath away. It makes you speachless. Your body is light and your mind is\
  \ clear. It seems that you can fly. You can count every single concave rib of the\
  \ rage. You can touch the nature of flame and wind, you can raise up to the sun.\
  \ You feel that you are becoming one whole thing with the world. There is nothing,\
  \ but calm and silence.\n But, look! Who is that man, standing on the edge of the\
  \ dragon's backbone? His hands are raised up, eyes are closed. His hair is painted\
  \ with the red clay and decorated with falcon's plumage. Not only one sun has been\
  \ sunk into his bronze face. Not only one moon has been hidden in twilight of his\
  \ lips. The man singing. Son of navajo, are you calling for thunderstorm? Throaty\
  \ sounds are running into the skies and clouds are spilling with the din of thunder.\n\
  \ Warm. First drops."
