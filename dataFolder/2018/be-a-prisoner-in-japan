Text: "Have you ever see the Vanilla sky? And how about Lavender sky? It's so strange\
  \ ,right? The same sky with different color. In the world, it has many different\
  \ degrees up to the places , time and feeling. \n\n\"Since we came to Thailand I\
  \ think Durian is the most delicious fruit\" Adam said. \n\"No, it's like an awkward\
  \ for me\" Alice answered her friend.\n\nAlice : \"Hey, you know? I went to Japan\
  \ last year and I got some ideas\"\nAdam : \"What is that?\"\nAlice : \" I went\
  \ to a restaurant and it's really awesome. You can't walk through by yourself but\
  \ somebody who wear costume like a police will come and ask you and friends. Who's\
  \ the bad guy. And then he put the shackle on you and you have to follow him the\
  \ the jail room\"\nAdam : \"Hey, I haven't heard that before! , What's the place\
  \ name? \"\nAlice : \nAlice : \" I arrived at the jail room and he closed the jail's\
  \ door and I had to order something to ate. All the things in the menus is really\
  \ strange. You will see many drinks in the different way as blood , poison , smoke\
  \ and etc. Some main dish are monster steaks , worm and something seems weird and\
  \ can't eat. And if you too slow to ordered. Somebody will put his hand in to the\
  \ room jail. It felt like a ghost and a bit scary. And you know, I really love that\
  \ idea. Mostly people like to go there and it's in Shibuya.  Do you wanna guess\
  \ what I ordered there? It's a drink\"\nAdam : \" I think about a bloody , may be\
  \ you wanna try being a vampire. Who know? Ha\"\n\nAlice : \" The things that I\
  \ ordered is a drink with an eye. And a one poison medicine\"\nAdam : \" Eye!? It's\
  \ not human eye , right? OMG!\nAlice : \" Yes, it's real. Ha, I'm kidding!  It's\
  \ a red eye gelatin. And the blue poison inside the medicine is a kind of cocktail.\
  \ I liked that place  so much. I felt like I'm a real prisoner who went through\
  \ a different world that caught by cruel police. I mean I feel like it's not a human\
  \ world \"  \nAdam : \" That's a cool experience! I never tried to go to the place\
  \ like this before and it sounds fancy. Wait, you told me that you got some idea,\
  \ right? What is that?\"\nAlice : \" I think I plan to do a fancy restaurant but\
  \ in a fancy way.  Now we live in Thailand right? And I love Thai culture so much.\
  \ On the other hand I can't forget that experience in Japan. I wanna do a Thai -\
  \ mix culture restaurant . May be Have  to wear Thai costume but eat something like\
  \ in the jungle or in the mood of natural old Thai . \"\n\nAnd that's all things\
  \ that she got inspiration from Japan experience last year."
