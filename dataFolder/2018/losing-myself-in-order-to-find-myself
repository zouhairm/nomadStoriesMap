Text: "My name is Marta Ribeiro and I'm an enthusiast about life itself. When I was\
  \ 19 years old I went to England to do my Erasmus and although I was really excited\
  \ to go, I didn't know what kind of things I was going to face. \nI was alone, trying\
  \ to make new friends and to see as much as possible and I was falling in love for\
  \ this new culture and becoming to feel like home.\nI had some problems over there\
  \ of course, so different from Portugal but I always managed them with strength\
  \ and confidence, otherwise that would be a terrible experience. \nI was living\
  \ in Salford, a small city near Manchester so I went to Manchester every time I\
  \ could. They say that on the seven day God created MANchester and I really think\
  \ so. It is a creative city, full of different people with the amazing Christmas\
  \ Markets and Christmas lights that fill the air with love and happiness like I\
  \ never felt before. \nI had my friends, I was studying exactly what I wanted and\
  \ I was being so creative that a lot of times I just took the bus on my own and\
  \ went to Manchester to take photos and write whatever I was felling like. This\
  \ was something that change my life because I knew what I wanted - to be that person\
  \ who was always being creative and taking in that cold fresh air of a new stage\
  \ in my life. \nFor my birthday we went to London and I couldn't believe that my\
  \ wish of being 20 in London would come true. We went on this adventure and I saw\
  \ even more amazing things. I still remember to enjoy the sun at Hyde Park with\
  \ my friends and just smile thinking I was becoming someone. I felt so inspired,\
  \ so curious about everything around me... the people, the stores, the buildings,\
  \ the movement, the nature, everything! \nThat experience made me a more independent\
  \ person and with more ambitions: to travel as much as possible so I could \"catch\"\
  \ all those feelings that new cultures can give to us and to be open minded so I\
  \ could really get the real experience. Something out of my comfort zone so I can\
  \ have new stories to tell. From that trip on I promised myself I would always remember\
  \ Manchester as my muse to do things, even the smallest things like writing a paragraph\
  \ or do a sketch. Like William Blake would say: \"My business is to create.\" \n\
  I went to Italy some years after and I experienced Italy like I did in England,\
  \ open minded, curious and happy to be surrounded by a new culture, people, costumes.\
  \ \nStudying abroad changed my life and really pushed me to be a better and a greater\
  \ person."
