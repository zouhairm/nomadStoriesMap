Text: "We stick out like sore thumbs in this pub. My backpack is hanging off my front,\
  \ and I can feel my passport under my shirt. I am an observer, not a participant.\
  \  \nA tap on my shoulder, my fingers curl around my camera, ready to shove it into\
  \ my bag.\n\u201CI like yer leaf,\u201D an Irish accent booms from behind me.\n\u201C\
  My what?\u201D\nA finger nudges at the maple leaf on the side of my backpack, I\
  \ look up at the curly-haired man towering over me, a smile blossoms from behind\
  \ his beard.  \n\u201CI love Canadians!\u201D He\u2019s not raising his beer for\
  \ a toast, but his arms are outstretched and his voice is booming.\nHe wrestles\
  \ a stool from a nearby table and nudges it between Nicole and me. His face is close\
  \ to mine. I can practically taste the Guinness on his breath.\n\u201CWe\u2019re\
  \ the same, you and me.\u201D\nOh Christ.\n\u201CWe\u2019re the only nations that\
  \ wear our flags when we travel. Because you don\u2019t want to be mistaken for\
  \ American and I sure as hell don\u2019t wanna be taken for a Brit.\u201D\nA laugh\
  \ bursts out of me. Nicole\u2019s wiping at the beer that\u2019s shot out of her\
  \ mouth, and through belly laughs we\u2019re swapping stories of stereotypes and\
  \ nations.\n\nIt\u2019s 2AM and we\u2019re eating at a pizza shop beside a sketchy\
  \ club in Portland. I joke that I haven\u2019t seen nearly as many phallic souvenirs\
  \ as I was expecting. There's laughter that morphs into discussion of the overpopulation\
  \ of a unique city.2AM turns into 4 and we\u2019re watching a starless night sky\
  \ and talking about urban effects on the human condition.\n\nI\u2019m in the cafeteria\
  \ of a research campus in CostaRica. And a quick hello to the man eating beside\
  \ me has led to the usual \u201CWhere are you from.\u201D It\u2019s followed by\
  \ that never too familiar phrase\u201CI love Canadians!\u201DAnd now we\u2019re\
  \ talking about Canada\u2019s investments in research tech,which veers into discussion\
  \ of the simultaneous unity and diversity of nature,spiraling into a discussion\
  \ of the universe.\n\nPart of the allure of crossing borders is the chance to shed\
  \ our own personal borders,to lose our own nationality and experience another.But\
  \ it\u2019s in the moments when we own our identities that borders turn into pathways\
  \ for human connection.There are few experiences quite as moving as sitting at a\
  \ bar that,to you, is exotic with a person to whom it\u2019s just that place they\
  \ go on Tuesdays.To look that person in the eye and say\u201CHi,this is where I\
  \ come from.\u201DTo have them respond in kind.You\u2019ve established your starting\
  \ points,and through shared passions and differing opinions,you\u2019ll somehow\
  \ end up in the middle,where the essence of humanity hides."
