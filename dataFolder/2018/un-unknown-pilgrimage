Text: "\u201CWill we make it?\u201D I wonder, as I listen to the whirring of the 1960s\
  \ Twin Otter, my hand being squeezed by the hyperventilating, 40-something gal next\
  \ to me. I nervously watch the pilot read a newspaper while his trainee takes the\
  \ yoke. A series of gasps cuts through the humming of the plane when I peek out\
  \ of the porthole to see the Himalayan range for the first time. Following the endless\
  \ 40 minute flight, I see the world\u2019s shortest mountain side runway come into\
  \ view, Lukla, the starting point of many-a-mission for folks embarking on their\
  \ dream of setting eyes on the world\u2019s tallest peaks.\n      After multiple\
  \ suspension bridges, Yaks, porters, Stupas, and monasteries, even catching a glimpse\
  \ of a \u201CYeti\u201D skull, I find myself on another planet. Nestled at 5380\
  \ meters, I have conquered Everest Base Camp. Words do not exist here, not much\
  \ of anything exists here, but I am utterly entranced by the vision before me; a\
  \ desolate terrain of grey and rock with a glacial backdrop. I am certain that I\
  \ have arrived at my destination, but soon realize that my story does not end here.\n\
  \      With mild trepidation, I set out at 3 AM the next morning. The temperatures\
  \ are colder and the air more dry than anything I have ever experienced. Slowly,\
  \ and with roughly half the oxygen, I reach the crest of Kala Patthar. My frozen,\
  \ crippled fingers pull out a small rolled up strand of prayer flags and I struggle\
  \ as my hands barely function from the bitter wind: \u201CDad, I tie these prayer\
  \ flags in memory of you. Thank you for you watching over me on this journey. My\
  \ broken heart loves and misses you tremendously everyday.\u201D Salt stings my\
  \ eyes and my heart swells. A brief pause, and I move on to celebrate my successful\
  \ summit bid, this awe-inspiring planet, and the gift of being alive. \n      With\
  \ each descending step, I reflect on this peaceful country and the generosity of\
  \ its natives toward the foreign wayfarers. I cling to every \u201CNamaste\u201D\
  \ spoken, every vibrantly-painted prayer wheel spun, and every tasty bite of Momo.\
  \ What was initially expected to be a trip to see the top of the world, turned into\
  \ my own personal pilgrimage of discovering people, prayer, and the importance of\
  \ being present. \"I made it!\", I say out loud."
