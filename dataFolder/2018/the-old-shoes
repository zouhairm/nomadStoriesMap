Text: "5 years ago I was living in Chile. I wanted to surprise my family in France\
  \ so I looked for a ticket home for summer. After a few clicks I find this cheap\
  \ flight. The problem was...it wasn't from Santiago. Actually, It wasn't even from\
  \ Chile but from Peru! So my plan was to take a flight to northern Chile and from\
  \ there I'll go to Lima by bus to catch my flight home 10 days later.. a short among\
  \ of time but long enough to experience travel the local way and meet people I will\
  \ never forget.\n So my flight lands in Arica, a city in the north of Chile. I ask\
  \ around and end up following the crowd to the ticket office which is situated in\
  \ an outside parking. Waiting for my turn, I am quite surprised to see advertisements\
  \ promoting 'health travel' in Peru to get your teeth fixed for cheap! I buy a ticket,\
  \ hop on in the bus direction Tacna. From there I buy my ticket for Lima and the\
  \ bus is not living before 3 hours. I look around and I realise that everyone else\
  \ a part for me is a local! I sit down and say hi to a boy that asks me If he can\
  \ polish the tramping boots I had on. I answer him 'I am afraid it's useless I almost\
  \ chuck them in the bin as they are falling into pieces'. He looks at them and tells\
  \ me they are so nice and doesn't understand how I can think about throwing them\
  \ away. We genuinely start talking about our lives. He is Carlos and he belongs\
  \ to a large family of eleven that he helps with two jobs, he lives hours from here\
  \ and spend hours in the bus each day. I decide to let these shoes shine and actually\
  \ they look a few years less! I didn't know yet what was decent to give but I remember\
  \ letting him 7 times more than what he asked me. \nLater on, I arrive to Lima and\
  \ decide to sleep in a hostal that the locals advise me. I have a few days ahead\
  \ to visit but I don't want to do the touristy things so I spend 2 days asking around\
  \ and checking the good travel books! I end up contacting with Haku tours which\
  \ gives 80% of the money of the tours for local project. I go for a tour of the\
  \ city with Edwin the owner, and I tell him I am guide too so we share guiding techniques.\
  \ We get along so well that I end up going to the 'shanty tour' with a great couple\
  \ from the US. We go in the suburb of Lima to local markets and eat in little restaurants!\
  \ We are thrilled by so many colours and smiles! \nI have visited Caral and Lima\
  \ but Peru wouldn't have been so great without Carlos and Edwin."
