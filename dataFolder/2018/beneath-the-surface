Text: "Beneath the Surface\n   I\u2019ve dipped my fins in many places\u2026\nWhen\
  \ I say fins, I mean it. I perform as Mermaid Mutiny here in Atlantic Canada and\
  \ have had the unique opportunity to swim and educate audiences all over our beautiful\
  \ province. So, when the opportunity to visit Florida\u2014the mermaid capital of\
  \ the world\u2014was proposed, I was in.\n   I set out with 30lbs of silicone tail\
  \ strapped to my back and I answered the weird questions at the airport (I mean,\
  \ how often do you see a mermaid tail going through airport security?). I smiled\
  \ to myself in response to the curious glances from onlookers. You don\u2019t become\
  \ a mermaid if you can\u2019t handle the attention.\n   Mermaiding in Florida is\
  \ filled with endless opportunities from Disney World to the famous Weeki Wachee\
  \ Mermaids, from networking with mermaids and tailmakers to swimming with sharks.\
  \ Yes! I swam with sharks. There are two types of travel experiences; both are equally\
  \ mermazing, but one is handed directly to you whilst you have to actively search\
  \ for the second type. I\u2019m talking about the tourist experience versus the\
  \ local experience. Everything I\u2019ve listed above falls into the former category,\
  \ but I want to share a day in the latter.\n   After meeting several local mermaids,\
  \ I was invited along to one of the best local secret springs that the mermaids\
  \ often frequent. On the surface, it is not unlike an average Canadian lake, so\
  \ excited but underwhelmed I adorned my tail, posed for pictures, and dipped my\
  \ fins. The skies opened and showered us with warm, heavy drops, and all ran, leaving\
  \ the mermaids alone to bask in the rainfall. We all laughed and taking deep breaths,\
  \ fully immersed ourselves in the water. Beneath the surface is a different world;\
  \ the rain pounds and provides a musical beat while the rays of the sun paint the\
  \ dark depths a turquoise hue and lightly touch the plants \u2013 not necessarily\
  \ special until you see them dancing in the light. So different it\u2019s breathtaking.\
  \ I came up too soon, needing to prepare myself better for the experience. To really\
  \ take the plunge, you must be brave enough to explore the well; a deep, dark space\
  \ in the center of the spring whose depths remain somewhat unexplored. With a wave\
  \ of my fins, I try again and again to go deeper into the darkness; to touch the\
  \ rocks and living plants that call this space home, but it is alas a place I will\
  \ never fully understand. Perhaps it maintains its beauty through its mystery. It\
  \ is a secret that only the mermaids share."
