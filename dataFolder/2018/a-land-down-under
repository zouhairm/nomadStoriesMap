Text: "For some people the connection with a place, a new destination, may involve\
  \ the steeped in culture, different languages, varying accents, large crowds of\
  \ people and architecture surrounding the skyline. But for some of us it can be\
  \ the silent constructs of mother earth.  Ocean as far as the eye can see, trees\
  \ that tower above and with wider trunks than you ever thought possible, mountains\
  \ that literally take the breath away and long stretches of sand and open plains\
  \ that stretch out under your feet waiting for your first step.\n\nThis is how Tasmania\
  \ lured me.  The natural beauty of the landscape wooed me like my newly-wed husband\
  \ on our honeymoon, ironically in this same destination many years ago for our first\
  \ visit.  We covered Launceston, Cradle Mountain, Beauty Point, Bicheno, Hobart\
  \ and Port Arthur across a two week road trip.  In the space of one day we were\
  \ enjoying the famous East Coast beaches watching blow holes and eating fresh seafood,\
  \ then to be holed up in a cabin surrounded by snow (not such a bad thing when honeymooning).\
  \ \n\nThis small island way \u2018Down Under\u2019 stretches 68,401 km2 in land\
  \ mass and is said to have evidence of Aboriginal presence from 40,000 years ago.\
  \  It is hard to imagine the island was once adjoined to mainland Australia, as\
  \ it feels and looks like a whole different country.  It is more wild and untamed.\
  \  Tasmania also has two of the country\u2019s oldest colonial cities, with a rich\
  \ history in convicts and bushrangers that help shape its rugged appeal.  It is\
  \ not uncommon to find yourself solo on any of the many regional beaches, with long\
  \ stretches of white sand and cold, clear water at your feet.  \n\nJurassic dolerite\
  \ can be found here more than anywhere else in the world.  Capping great highland\
  \ mountains and cliffs, the hard stone produces an awe inspiring sight.  Even the\
  \ capital city of Hobart, located down South, has a great towering mountain, Kunanyi/Mt\
  \ Wellington dominating the vista, enthusing climbers and photographers alike. \
  \ This place is akin to a spiritual experience, as clich\xE9d as it may sound. \
  \ But it is not just a matter of seeing it to believing it, a full sensory experience\
  \ is needed.  Breathe. Climb. Walk. Repeat."
