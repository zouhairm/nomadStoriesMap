Text: "Here I was in the most sacred city of India, the city of Varanasi, nestled\
  \ on the banks of the holy Ganges River. \n\nThere was something that appealed to\
  \ me about the rawness of this place. Yet it overwhelmed me at the same time. \n\
  \nDuring my four days here I walked daily along the banks of the Ganges and became\
  \ familiar with the different Ghats. I beheld the beauty of the waters together\
  \ with the hustle and bustle of tourists, pilgrims, locals and roaming cows.  \n\
  \nAt times I would descend the steps of the Ghats and sit witnessing the activity\
  \ around me. Up close the water was of a brownish colour. Although tempted to join\
  \ the pilgrims in the waters, I was also aware of warnings about heavy pollution.\
  \ However, those who had come here for worship were oblivious to sanitation concerns.\
  \ All around me, individuals and families were submerging themselves in the waters.\
  \ \n\nOne early morning I took a sunrise boat ride along the Ganges. This morning\
  \ pilgrimage had been suggested to me by fellow tourists. So that morning before\
  \ sunrise I set off to meet a young boat rider who would be my guide. He did not\
  \ speak English but that suited me as I wanted to savour the sense of peace and\
  \ serenity as we sailed across the calm morning waters. Behind us, the views and\
  \ sounds of colourful temples and morning rituals. \n\nAt the end of our journey\
  \ he landed me back on one of the holiest Ghats, Manikarnika. And oh, what an atmosphere\
  \ was there. I was unprepared for what I saw. I had arrived from calm waters and\
  \ entered into a raw celebration of death. There before me, a dead human body blazing\
  \ in fire, the smoke filling the air, sounds of chanting and chattering, and all\
  \ set against the backdrop of one of the most beautiful rivers in the world. \n\n\
  Varanasi encapsulates the vibrancy of life, the reality of death and the longing\
  \ for a sacred meaning in it all. And what flows through all this is the Ganges.\
  \ In her waters the living purify and the dead find salvation. To the western, rational\
  \ mind, her waters are infested with pollution. But to the Indians, her blessed\
  \ waters can only be worshiped. \n\nOn my final day in Varanasi I sat by the Ganges\
  \ feeling a deep appreciation. I finally had the courage to wet my hands and feet\
  \ in the holy waters. \n\nI am humbled remembering that burning body now. Perhaps\
  \ I never met him in the living, but am forever changed by witnessing him in the\
  \ glory of his death. I hope he will forever be blessed and that he found his salvation\
  \ in those sacred waters of the Ganges."
