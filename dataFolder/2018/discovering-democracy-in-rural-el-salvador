Text: "In a schoolroom high up on the volcanic mountains of Cinquera, I sat slumped\
  \ in a plastic chair, distractedly brushing a fly off my leg. Despite the absence\
  \ of doors and windows, the room was just as silent as the dirt roads outside. There\
  \ might be sounds of traffic in nearby Suchitoto, but in here the backwoods of El\
  \ Salvador, there was only the clucking of chickens to break the peace. \nI turned\
  \ to the other Canadian sitting next to me. \u201CDemocracy is boring, eh?\u201D\
  \n\u201CToo true\u201D.\nThere was noise in the doorway, and I looked up from my\
  \ lunch. A man with a sharply pressed shirt and cowboy hat appeared at the door,\
  \ his horse left outside and flicking his tail with annoyance. The farmer walked\
  \ through the emptiness of the entrance to the gathered people, while I sat off\
  \ to the side, silently observing. A cardboard box stood between the gathering and\
  \ the newcomer, but he made his way purposely to the table on which it stood. \n\
  It was referendum day in Cinquera, and we were at a voting booth. After years of\
  \ bloody civil war, voting is not taken lightly in El Salvador. The mountains where\
  \ I was sitting now had been hiding places for a rebel army, many of whom were former\
  \ civilians turned soldiers. \nThe farmer stood gravely before the voting committee\
  \ as they read the ballot aloud to make sure he is aware of the choice before him:\
  \ Yes or no; should mining companies be banned in Cinquera? \nWith a nod, he accepted\
  \ a pencil and retreated behind the box to make his choice. Illiteracy in El Salvador\
  \ is not a disqualifying factor from having the ability to vote. After the civil\
  \ war, people who had once mobilized resistance fighters fought a new crusade to\
  \ give farmers a voice just as loud as any international behemoth.\nAs the sun slid\
  \ towards the Western horizon, a crackling voice came over the election officer\u2019\
  s radio, and she signaled us to gather round. I was not allowed to betray emotion,\
  \ but I knew it might be close. \nIn the end, it wasn\u2019t. About 98% of people\
  \ voted against the mines, and organizers I had met in the past few months celebrated.\
  \ \nI was back home in Canada when I receive news from an unexpected source- the\
  \ New York Times. After that final referendum in Cinquera, the national government\
  \ had passed unprecedented legislation to ban mines from the entire country, and\
  \ I was astonished. It was the very last thing I expected. A quiet revolution had\
  \ replaced the violence of guns, but the result was just the same: farmers in rural\
  \ El Salvador had risen their voice."
