Text: So i never thought about it before when i was living in my village somewhere
  in Himachal pradesh but it struck my mind one day that i have my own private site
  where i can enjoy and no one can disturb me or   interfere with my workings. So
  for the last 10 years i've been living in punjab and studying law, yeah law i never
  thought about it but this preferred line is giving me enough time to enjoy the nature
  and that's what i'm doing.  i'm 20 and i've been to many places in my life whether
  it is mountains or deserts i've seen them in real life. That one place i've never
  been to or didn't knew the feeling about being there yeah a shore a big sea or a
  pond, i just wanted to feel that endless water moment where you just cannot see
  the ground far away all you are seeing is water. That one place was Near my village.
  No Vehicle can take you there you have to go by foot, i love doing that i'm a Himachali
  guy you know a typical guy who just knows about the mountains and belongs there,
  so i've been there before but never thought that how much important it is for me,
  It's a reservoir of a dam and it's pretty huge it was made in 70s decade.  my parents
  tell me there used to be a road there which goes through the river but not anymore,
  they also said there was a big tree in the centre and all the animals used to sit
  there but when water hit first and when water went back it was not their anymore.
  i really wanted to be their the moment this became a reservoir i miss that, to be
  honest i want to go back in future and live their i will have no regrets, nowadays
  you just have to study and work and die. what if i was born then i would have so
  much to do all places weren't discovered then i would have enjoyed those times just
  to go for an adventure without anyone watching but not anymore you can't do different
  now it's sad but it's true, so keeping all this behind i travelled there at my secret
  place i just took my lunch with me and wore my shoes and a stick and a water bottle
  and i left now to reach their i had to go through forest big forest and trust me
  there were so many bushes and wild plants but i never stopped just going through
  all the things and i reached there just seeing sun falling and that waterside and
  i was just running like a freak, here and there then i went swimming and just enjoyed
  all the things, everyone has a special place where they enjoy mine was there and
  i just go there every time i go to my village it's just my life that one place makes
  me forget everything
