Text: "Home is the place where one does not really expect to find uniqueness and surprise,\
  \ but it happens. This spin happened just a few hours away from home, at the lovely,\
  \ unknown community of Angamarca, Ecuador.\n\n\nSome rich kids of the capital were\
  \ convinced by the neighborhood priest to go on a volunteer experience.  Around\
  \ 50 of us ran into the bus and went to the mountains. I saw some Nike, some Adidas\
  \ and Reeboks ready to get dirty. The mountains down there had different kinds of\
  \ tones, but all of them remained half grey, half green. Everything in Ecuador seems\
  \ to have this color, even the sea.\n\nLater on, it turned up to be 4 hours instead\
  \ of 2. We walked 2 more hours across the cow poop and the bugs. The few houses\
  \ were fully painted with the colors of some political parties, and the few light\
  \ posts available were filled with political propaganda from many, many years ago.\
  \ Dandelion flowers dared to grow everywhere and, in some rare occasions, they even\
  \ handled to cover all those politician\u2019s faces. \n\nWhen we arrived, poverty\
  \ was just around the corner. Our mission was to build a house, so we had to carry\
  \ bags full of sand down the mountain. Our sleeping place was the only school in\
  \ the town, and our diet consisted on tomato, rice and cooked potatoes. There were\
  \ no showers at all, and the weather was so chilly people kept working just to keep\
  \ warm.  \n\nHowever, and there is always a however, there was a kid who was different\
  \ than the others. He was a local. He appeared on the second day and never left\
  \ us. He helped us to carry the sandbags over and over again, being no more than\
  \ 7 years old. His name was Victor Manuel. \n\nSome of the guys said that he was\
  \ there for the food, but he never stopped smiling. He prayed with us and helped\
  \ when the wild dogs tried to attack. He knew more than everybody else. His smile\
  \ was permanent, but yellow as a piece of corn. \n\nThe last day, when we woke up,\
  \ Victor Manuel wasn't there.   We started looking for him. I went outside the house\
  \ and started looking around the cows' area. When I was close to the lake, I felt\
  \ that someone touched my shoulder. It was him. He offered me a dandelion and smiled\
  \ again.\n\n\"Pay\", he said. Pay is a short way to say \"God pays you\". \n\nAnd\
  \ he ran away. Four of five giant hounds ran after him and he didn't looked worried.\
  \ \n\nLater on, back in the capital, I found out that the house we were building\
  \ was for Victor and his family."
