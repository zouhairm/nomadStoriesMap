Text: "The growing crowd makes our plain-clothes police escort nervous. He nods as\
  \ the guide deftly leads us through 21 centuries of history but I watch his eyes\
  \ dart everywhere as heads pop out of beat-up doorways and figures materialize from\
  \ shady corners. I\u2019m uneasy too. After being evacuated from Libya, I know how\
  \ quickly a peaceful meeting can combust into a mindless mob. And yet, here I stand\
  \ in a place with 80,000+ people packed into its crumbling walls and a long history\
  \ of rebellion, thievery, and violence. Why had I agreed to come to the heart of\
  \ Algeria: the Casbah? \n\nWe walk deeper into the labyrinth, the silent horde following\
  \ close behind. I touch a Roman column jutting out of a plaster wall and several\
  \ kids leap forward to do it too. I clutch my purse as our policeman shoos them\
  \ away. The S\xFBret\xE9 have discouraged this visit. We are in the country to open\
  \ a highly publicized int'l school, and they are worried about a possible incident\
  \ tarnishing Algeria\u2019s new image as a safe, friendly place. However, the Casbah,\
  \ of Pep\xE9 Le Pew and The Clash fame as well as a UNESCO site, is firmly on my\
  \ Director\u2019s bucket list, so here we are. \n\nUp side alleys float whiffs of\
  \ rotting fruit, baking bread, sewage, and the sea. The lane narrows, dimmed by\
  \ eroding cantilevered overhangs above our heads, and we pass only inches from carved\
  \ doors. One creaks open and we jump back. The man coming out freezes in open-mouthed\
  \ surprise. I risk a half-smile with a nod and so does he. \n\nA woman in blue hijab\
  \ catches my elbow. \u201CCome see my school,\u201D she invites in careful English.\
  \ I hesitate but our policeman nods yes. The group, some of them her students, waits\
  \ at the gate until we resume our journey. \n\nThere are almost no shops; only a\
  \ woman who sells hand-painted pottery and an old man who solders brass lanterns.\
  \ Neither hustles us. \n\nWe stop for syrupy, mint tea. Show over, the gathering\
  \ fades away with a few waves. The owner ushers us up sagging steps to his rooftop.\
  \ He apologizes for its emptiness; he hopes to soon have tables. But my attention\
  \ is on Algiers, the white city, fanned out before us. \n\n\u201CLook!\u201D our\
  \ guide says. I glance down through the patchwork of roofs and flapping laundry,\
  \ to the worn alleys that crisscross to the souk. What fabled Algerian detail is\
  \ he so excited to share that his voice wavers with emotion? He points to a tiny\
  \ group of people, wending their way in. \u201COur first group of Japanese tourists!\u201D\
  \ \n\nWhy come to Algeria? Because they want you, too."
