Text: "A scarce assortment of traits are required to compel a middle-class twenty-year-old\
  \ to fly thirteen arduous hours from the convenience of home to a place that is,\
  \ well, shortcoming in agreeable reputation. However, Dylan White, being the philanthropic\
  \ altruist that he is, is in possession of such, finding himself on a torrid Tanzanian\
  \ day, ardently forming and combining concrete for the foundations of a basic classroom,\
  \ like a witch over a cauldron, only charitable and forthcoming. \nAs a blanket\
  \ of fire thrashed down on his SPF-fifty-plus-lathered back, the perpetual, signature\
  \ \u2018whuuu\u2019 of the concrete mixer permeated the air for hundreds of metres\
  \ in all directions, befalling Dylan\u2019s only scant awareness of the hysterical,\
  \ horrified shrieking to the northeast. Situated roughly two-hundred metres from\
  \ any neighbouring establishment and besieged by open, safari-style, grass-and-shrub-pervaded\
  \ plains, the plot dedicated to the classroom was exposed to invasion from a myriad\
  \ of local wildlife species, as was to become abhorrently apparent in the forthcoming.\n\
  As Dylan comprehended and became abruptly conscious of the sobering cacophony of\
  \ clamour assaulting the serenity of the grassy expanse, the instinctive, adrenaline-fuelled\
  \ snap of his neck to an angle that permitted observation proved prosperous. Bordering\
  \ on one-hundred metres north of the build site was the chilling vision of Ada,\
  \ one of the townspeople, desperately succumbing to a ghastly attack from a pair\
  \ of spotted hyenas.\nThe scene hadn\u2019t even enough time to navigate from Dylan\u2019\
  s eyes to his brain before he found himself charging toward the scene of the atrocity,\
  \ thrashing his slender arms unintelligibly through the air, ensuing a rage between\
  \ the hyenas. The notably bolder of the beasts launched at Dylan, snarling with\
  \ animosity. Instinctively throwing his arm up to block the primed jaws of the hyena,\
  \ a distinct bone-crunch was audible as the beast connected and flexed its jaw around\
  \ Dylan\u2019s searing skin. His instinctive and furious slamming of his fist into\
  \ the beast\u2019s head left it no choice but surrender the vice-like grip it had\
  \ gained and cower away, the other monster trailing behind.\nAda was found in a\
  \ lurid but conscious state, and the beginning of the town\u2019s primary path was\
  \ where Dylan was met, Ada in arms, by distraught but revering members of her family\
  \ and community. Neither the day of the hyenas nor Dylan were forgotten by members\
  \ of the township, relationships for life safely secured."
