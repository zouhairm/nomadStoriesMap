Text: "I'm in northwest Argentina, in a little native village called Purmamarca which\
  \ is nothing more than few little dirt roads, low adobe houses, a square where the\
  \ handicraft market takes place, a white church from the 17th century, altogether\
  \ nestled in an arid, colorful hilly landscape. There's not much to do here, and\
  \ maybe that is why I like it so much. I can still remember the extreme silence\
  \ of the surrounding nature and the quietness of my steps.\n\nIt's dinner time.\
  \  I stroll around with a Belgian couple I met, in search of options.  A perfect\
  \ round-shaped ivory moon helps the weak street-illumination.  Hardly a soul to\
  \ be found.\nWe hesitate in front of a little restaurant that calls to us with its\
  \ cozy atmosphere and an inviting sign reading \"Music and Poetry Tonight\u201D\
  . We decide to give it a try aware that the 90 pesos we have left probably won't\
  \ cover the meal.\nThe music of a gaucho playing milongas with his guitar and the\
  \ soft lights make me feel welcomed.\nWe silently walk straight to the bar to have\
  \ a look at the menu. After the sad confirmation that prices are out of our budget,\
  \ I ask the waiter with my best smile, if there's anything we can get for 90 pesos.\
  \ He smiles back at me and says that he can prepare us a homemade pasta. A glass\
  \ of wine is on the house.\nWe sit down excited, feeling very lucky for the waiter's\
  \ kindness.  \nAn old native man is now reciting a poem. His sharpening solemn voice\
  \ penetrates the silence of the room. Suddenly I lose all dimension of this place.\n\
  After the dinner we're invited to join the table of the musician and the native\
  \ old man. Out of nowhere the old man asks me for the first word that comes to my\
  \ mind: I respond instinctively \"life\".  He puts a hand on my shoulder, looks\
  \ straight into my eyes to a point where I feel a bit uncomfortable, and tells me\
  \ that when I was around seven years old I found myself in a circumstance of pain\
  \ and fear that made me understand the meaning of the word \u201Clife\u201D.  \n\
  It's not the first time that I'm invited to reflect about this potentially important\
  \ period from my childhood, so hearing it again from a stranger surprises me and\
  \ catches my attention. I ask him how he can know this, and he gently smiles and\
  \ says: \u201CYou've just told me with the word you chose\u201D. I'm anxious to\
  \ know how to reach that memory, but he simply comforts me saying not to worry because\
  \ I'm on the right track and I'll get there eventually.\n\nI've been thinking about\
  \ his words since then. It's a work in progress."
