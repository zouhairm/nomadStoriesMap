Text: "It was my first morning in Gro\xDFmugl less than a year ago. At 6.12, the 827-bus\
  \ halted at its spot. Gro\xDFmugl Hauptstra\xDFe. Standing next to me was a tiny\
  \ girl, eyes half-closed. We were both sleepy, but I kept my mouth shut. \u201C\
  Drei Euro dreizig\u201D the driver said and smiled. I understood the smile. \u201C\
  Three euros thirty cents, please\u201D he added, and took the sufficient amount\
  \ from my hand. No! It was not embarrassing! \nSeconds after we left Gro\xDFmugl\
  \ behind, the region revealed in all its green and brown flatness. I wondered how\
  \ much toil was needed for a patch of land to be tamed to that extreme. There was\
  \ a shrill sound, and the bus stopped. A boy with a Toy Story-backpack got off which\
  \ made me wonder if the bus stopped only when asked to. So, I took a seat closer\
  \ to the driver. \u201CDoes\u201D he said a second later, showing me a herd of delicate\
  \ creatures in a gothic plain. It was a good start of a hunter\u2019s story. I learnt\
  \ that does in Lower Austria were hunters\u2019 favourite. It was however, troublesome\
  \ for me to understand the policy of nurturing a creature only to hunt and kill\
  \ it later, but Mr. Schmitz told me that it wasn\u2019t by any means for profit.\
  \ I was a tourist and quickly resorted to what tourists do best. I observed. \n\
  The next morning, Mr Schmitz tried not to laugh when I handed him the coins I had\
  \ piled in advance. \u201CDrei Euro dreizig\u201D I said and got the politest genau\
  \ ever. It was a bright morning with plenty of sunshine and dew spilled all around.\
  \ Nature had made itself pretty for my gaze, and I felt grateful for the now familiar\
  \ plains. I had never seen so many pumpkins at one place. There was so much appeal\
  \ to their colour, that it was hard to be focused on anything, but those masterfully\
  \ grown heads. \u201CThey grow them for the seeds\u201D Mr. Schmitz said. \u201C\
  Halloween too\u201D he laughed, and I joined in. I never saw Mr. Schmitz again.\n\
  Until today. \u201CI\u2019m in Vienna now. Studying\u201D I mumble in German, handing\
  \ him three euros thirty. I take my seat. It's comfortable. As I greet my fields,\
  \ Cronon comes to mind. He tells me it's all nature, and that it doesn\u2019t have\
  \ to be wild to be real. Nature opens itself to me. The others are there too. Sleepy\
  \ Eva (I know her name now!) and the Toy Story boy are learning that the mugl in\
  \ Gro\xDFmugl used to be way bigger before the erosion. \u201CErosion, how could\
  \ you?\u201D they think. Mr. Schmitz can\u2019t decide on a pumpkin. I help him.\
  \ He once told me he loved home-baked pumpkin with cinnamon and sugar. I like it\
  \ too. It tastes heavenly!"
