Text: Last year December I went to Eastern Shan State in Myanmar and I saw lots of
  kids and people how they live. Even though they are not very rich but the way how
  they live for their lives is actually different from the one who stays in the city.They
  live under one roof and they celebrate their party with their friends and most of
  them with their family. The most exciting one is that I saw a poor woman, she is
  a widow who has 6children. But her children who went for work on other places don't
  come and see her. She washed other clothes in order to get money for her little
  kids. Even though it is difficult for her  but she still let's her kids to go to
  school. Sometimes she didn't even has some rice to eat. At her home, it has two
  pans and a mosquito net for her whole family. When I went to her house,that house
  was a little bit shaking. I was wonderful about that and my heart is melting. That's
  why before I went back I bought a pack of rice and some oil for her. She was really
  thankful and I feel cheerful .This makes me have a strong desire to be the one who
  can help other people. And this helps me makes my mind so powerful and I know my
  passion. I want to open an international school especially give the children who
  don't even have a chance to attend school. Thanks very much.
