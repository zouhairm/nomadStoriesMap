Text: "Hi, my name is Steve. I live and work in Sydney, Australia. In fact, I'm currently\
  \ writing this from the famed Bondi Beach. I work full time in IT sales, but a rare\
  \ break coincided with my discovery of this contest. When I woke this up this morning,\
  \ creating a presentable travel story was the last thing I expected to tackle today.\n\
  \nI've travelled a lot. I've been blessed enough to visit some outstanding places.\
  \ But when I think about the context of this contest, I imagine the majority of\
  \ entrants are writing about an epic mountain climb that \"pushed them to the edge\"\
  \ or staying with a host family in a far away land, allowing them to \"make a local\
  \ connection.\"  These adventurous stories have plenty of merit, but sometimes in\
  \ competition you have to try something different to stand out. So my story will\
  \ be about my walk to the beach just now.\n\nI believe that \"travel\" is a relative\
  \ term. It can be a 6 month adventurous wanderlust trip. Or it can be something\
  \ as simple as a walk around your neighbourhood if you have the right mindset. \
  \ \n\nI've done this exact walk to Bondi plenty of times. It's only about 15 minutes.\
  \ But today I made sure to take note of all the beauty around me.  First of all\
  \ it's a gorgeous day.  It's on the warmer side, but there's a nice ocean breeze.\
  \ It reminds me of when you have to stick your foot out of the blanket to get the\
  \ perfect sleeping temperature.  It's balanced and delightful.  The sky seems brighter\
  \ and bluer than normal.  Is that just because I'm making an extra effort to look\
  \ at it?  Maybe it's my new sunglasses.\n\nThere are some stunning flowers here.\
  \  Even the most average looking yard shrubs carry insane floral arrangements. \
  \ My favourite tree here sprouts flowers with a colour scheme that resembles a papaya\
  \ fading into a mango.  It's tropical bliss.\n\nI saw 2 Rainbow Lorikeets - birds\
  \ that look as though they're draped in a technicolor dreamcoat.  I don't know how\
  \ all that colour was shoved into such a tiny bird.  And their chirps sound like\
  \ birds from an animated Disney movie.  Simply lovely.\n\nThe beach itself is buzzing.\
  \  Surfers line the horizon and people tanning stretch as far as I can see.  The\
  \ sounds of waves crashing, chatter and laughter mix together in perfect harmony.\n\
  \nI think it's important for people to remember that \"travel\" can happen anytime.\
  \  If you walk outside your house looking for beauty and adventure, you'll find\
  \ it.  With this mindset you can travel everyday.  Peace."
