Text: "When I set off on my merry way to meet two friends on a trip to New York, the\
  \ place I had always imagined visiting, longed to visit. The last thing I expected\
  \ was to end up alone.  But that\u2019s how the story goes\nSwiftly after arriving\
  \ in the Big Apple, we set about the usual pattern of discussing what we want to\
  \ do. New York was great and lived up to my expectations, the sights, the sounds\
  \ the smells and illusive buzz you can\u2019t quite put your finger on but feel\
  \ it in every step. \nBut with all the excitement the week in New York was nearly\
  \ over. But not having to rush back home for work since I was on an extended vacation\
  \ (or unemployed as some people like to call it),  I thought, \u201Cwhy not stay\
  \ longer and make the most of this and enjoy more?\u201D So without much more thought,\
  \ that\u2019s exactly what I did. \nAfter one quick phone call to change my flight\
  \ and some tinkering with my accommodation reservation, it was done.  I was going\
  \ to be in NYC for another week.\nWith a fresh sense of accomplishment it dawned\
  \ on me.  What will I do, who will I do it with and does this mean I\u2019ll spend\
  \ the next week speaking to strangers on the subway as a last hope for companionship?\
  \ \nWhilst there were drawbacks of travelling for one; the presumed judgement when\
  \ you order a ticket for one, the awkwardness of eating alone or the missing sense\
  \ of being able to share the moment with someone close the experience offered so\
  \ much more. \nTraveling alone gave me a new found vigor for exploration.  I was\
  \ able to set my own schedule, see and do all the things I really wanted to do and\
  \ even sleep in and order room service and just, be.  \nNot only that, I found I\
  \ had a boost to my self-confidence and unbeknown to myself before embarking on\
  \ this mini-adventure, it gave me a chance to get to know more about myself.\nNew\
  \ York is also a great city to do it in.  With an near endless options of things\
  \ to do I indulged in strolls through Central Park, mused through endless coffee\
  \ shops, propped up restaurant bars to order my meal for one (it\u2019s a little\
  \ more comforting sitting at a restaurant bar on your lonesome that at a table.\
  \  You also have the added bonus of friendly bar staff to keep you entertained.\
  \ \nAfter the initial fears and doubts I found that I flourished in the freedom\
  \ to set my own path.  Yes there were great highs and also some lows but overall\
  \ the experience, was one I relished.\nSo the next time you see yourself eyeing\
  \ up a great holiday deal, why not take the plunge and do it alone."
