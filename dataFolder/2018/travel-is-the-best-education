Text: "How does visiting with one of the worlds oldest and still living cultures sound?\
  \  And even better, being invited back to live with them!   This is the decision\
  \ our family of four currently faces after a connection with an Aboriginal clan\
  \ so deep, that it will be difficult to put into words.\n\nI knew the seven hour,\
  \ four wheeled drive trip to the remote community of Gapuwiyak would be rough; but\
  \ I could never have fathomed the dangerous driving conditions, hidden washouts,\
  \ and crocodile infested waters that flowed over the once intact, and rich red,\
  \ dirt road.  The relentless rain, storm and winds, signalled the Northern Australian\
  \ monsoon season was now in full swing.  \"What an opportunity!\" Rob, my headstrong\
  \ son exclaimed.  \"I'm so excited!\" Abby followed in her usual cute princess voice.\
  \  Even at the young ages of eight and five years old, they were aware that receiving\
  \ an invite to visit an Aboriginal Homeland community was a once in a lifetime opportunity,\
  \ or so we thought.\n\nArriving to the modest tin home, nerves of our acceptance\
  \ were building.  'Are we Balanda to them?'  Descendants of the Europeans who destroyed\
  \ their culture, tore apart their families and dictate how they should live?  If\
  \ so, I understand.  But despite this, after hearing whispers of our plight to educate\
  \ our children through real world experiences, their invitation to us was clear\
  \ \u201CBring the children and we will show you what it is like to be Yolngu\u201D\
  .\n\nForever in my memory will be the expressive smiles from the dark skinned faces,\
  \ and the hordes of laughter and delight from the Aboriginal children as we arrived.\
  \  Excitedly the Yolngu children brought \u2018Darpinta\u2019, giant caterpillars\
  \ for our children to play with, and intricately hand woven mats, made from local\
  \ trees to inspect.  All the children were all instantly connected by the only international\
  \ language that truly knows no boundaries, the language of play.  Some of the children\
  \ had never seen fair skin before or even blonde curly hair; and even despite the\
  \ gory history between our cultures, none of those difference mattered in those\
  \ moments, when our children were all truly connected in play.  \n\nAs adults, we\
  \ could learn a lot from our kids.  See past the physical differences, forget the\
  \ prejudices and connect in with the same values we all ultimately want; to feel\
  \ understood, accepted, and be part of a community.  Both families met with this\
  \ unspoken truth, and have given our children the best outlook to succeed in life."
