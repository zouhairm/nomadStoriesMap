Text: "On my arrival at the international airport of Mumbai I thought the city is\
  \ all about houses of celebrities, expensive restraints and beautiful beaches  but\
  \ at last it proved me wrong.\nMumbai, the fourth-largest city in the world, is\
  \ home to 20 million people.  It would sound very clich\xE9d to call Mumbai the\
  \ New York of India, but that is what describes this city of dreams the best. It\
  \ depicts the place that is always up and about, a city with a spirit of gold and\
  \ a determination to never say die, even in the wake of terrorist attacks and natural\
  \ calamities\nOn my visit to the Gateway of India, the central attraction of the\
  \ city I saw many photographers with a printing machine to print photos instantly.\
  \ I talked to one of them, he was surprised when I said that I want to take one\
  \ picture of him eventually he must be thinking that it is my work not yours. \n\
  I like to awaken my inner Columbus whenever I got a chance, so I went  for a two-hour\
  \ long sailing-boat trip from the Gateway of India and also went kayaking around\
  \ Girgaum Chowpatty. These are just two of many outdoorsy experiences possible around\
  \ Mumbai. Mumbai is also famous for its delicious street food and if you want the\
  \ best you can visit any beach in Mumbai and you\u2019ll have the best street food\
  \ of your life.\nWhen you are driving down the road on Mumbai you can see multinational\
  \ business houses on the one hand and decaying structures, slums and the overcrowded\
  \ surroundings on the other.\nIndia has the biggest slum in Asia \u2013Dharavi.\
  \  The people living there are not familiar with the limelight of the city. I saw\
  \ small kids playing with tyres, housewives chatting and laughing maybe they have\
  \ set path with their poverty and condition. But there are still dreams in eyes\
  \ of some kids as I asked to one boy who was playing with a toy plane that what\
  \ he wants to become in life he proudly replied that he wish to become a pilot.\
  \ The people there \nAfter the night was dark but the city was still awaken I went\
  \ to Marine drive and believe me a walk down Marine Drive, along the Arabian Sea,\
  \ is all that is required to soothe one\u2019s soul after a day full of hectic activity.\n\
  Here\u2019s what I love the most about Mumbai_ It\u2019s people. No matter what\
  \ the situation, whatever the challenge, or the calamity, the resilient nature of\
  \ Mumbai\u2019s people always shines through. More dreams are realized in Mumbai\
  \ than any other place in the country \u2013 this is a city where you always have\
  \ another chance to succeed if you have the \u2018Mumbai Spirit\u2019."
