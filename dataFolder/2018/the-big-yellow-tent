Text: "After a few years of stalking the IG page of Lightening in a Bottle I was finally\
  \ ready to go, (roughly translated that means I had enough pennies in the piggy\
  \ bank.) \nI did have the thought, \u201CIt\u2019s probably not safe for me to fly\
  \ clear across the country, by myself, to go to a music festival, that I had never\
  \ been to,\u201D but I wasn\u2019t about to let opportunity pass me by. Fear, smear!\
  \ I live life on the edge.\nI met a kick ass bunch of festival goers who were ready\
  \ to break me in. Right after my nap.\nWhen I woke and slid out of my tent later\
  \ that night, the stars were covering the sky. \nI high-fived a couple strangers\
  \ I passed on the bridges, (LIB tradition) and wandered into a couple tents. \n\
  Everything was so great. I couldn\u2019t believe I was actually there. The air got\
  \ cooler just as the sky turned a deeper blue. I rubbed the chill bumps on my arm\
  \ and headed back to the campsite searching for the big yellow tent of the guy who\
  \ was set up beside me. \nTwo hours later and I was still wandering. How the crap\
  \ had I been stupid enough to not pay more attention to the road signs and area\
  \ clues? I found a guy who was willing to help me look for it but after god knows\
  \ how long, he wished me well. He did offer me his coat before walking quickly away\
  \ as if to escape my idiocy. I met another guy who offered me a flashlight that\
  \ I had to promise to return in the morning. By two in the morning I was ready to\
  \ go home and forget the whole festival. I could not have been more humiliated.\
  \ I wasn\u2019t even drunk.  At this point I realized I wasn\u2019t really that\
  \ good at living life on the edge. I was actually more of an awkward teenager pretending\
  \ to be an adult. Only I wasn\u2019t a teenager and hadn\u2019t been for a while.\n\
  \u201CDo you know what\u2019s by it?\u201D \u201CUhmm, its by a big yellow tent,\u201D\
  \ I kept answering in a not really sure way. People had begun to play Pass-The-Adult-Baby\
  \ with me as the night went on. So many people helped in the search for the big\
  \ yellow tent I was starting to feel like a small child.  The last guy who got stuck\
  \ with me, tired and somehow feeling obligated to keep me safe, gave me an extra\
  \ sleeping bag and allowed me to sleep in his tent. I suspected he had wings under\
  \ his jacket but I thought better than to ask. I reluctantly opened my eyes the\
  \ next morning still embarrassed and feeling two feet tall. I was determined to\
  \ find the stupid tent on my own, though. And I didn\u2019t think it was possible\
  \ to feel any smaller, but I stood corrected as I stared at the big ORANGE tent."
