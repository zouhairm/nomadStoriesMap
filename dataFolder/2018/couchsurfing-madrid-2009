Text: "Before Airbnb, budget traveling with a human connection to locals meant you\
  \ were a Couchsurfer. You made an account, signed in from a desktop computer, detailed\
  \ your travels, posted personal words of wisdom and things you could trade with\
  \ people interested in getting to know you: recipes, origami. The emphasis was on\
  \ community, on the belief that kind humans open their homes, free of charge, in\
  \ exchange for conversation and small trinkets from your home. I didn\u2019t think\
  \ I was part of a movement that would change my life and how I travel, but I was,\
  \ and it did.\n\nMy worst experience was with a woman who dumped my luggage on a\
  \ street corner in Madrid. Not approving of my \u201Cgrand adventure into the great\
  \ unknown,\u201D or the fact that I\u2019d just lost my job, she told me that I\
  \ needed to get out. There no excuse offered, just \u201CYou\u2019re not welcome\
  \ here, get your things.\u201D I lugged two suitcases and carry-on half a block\
  \ to a diner in her neighborhood to cry, think, regroup, order a bocadillo (the\
  \ pork or ham and cheese sandwiches that I lived on while I was there) and tea.\
  \ I signed into CS to post an SOS and email someone I\u2019d met in El Sol, the\
  \ heart of Madrid.\n\nLeonardo was new to CS. It was winter, one of the coldest\
  \ Madrid had seen, and Leo, the Venezuelan practicing his English, was still keen\
  \ to walk around. We stood inside the massive Christmas tree lit up red & green\
  \ and looked up to the sky; he felt small with me. He led me to the Royal Palace\
  \ and didn\u2019t mind me stopping to take photographs of the moon inside my shots\
  \ of a statue of a man on a horse. \n\nWhen there\u2019s a seven-way intersection,\
  \ how can anyone tell which way the signs point? How does one not get lost? Back\
  \ in the diner, I was lonely and unmoored, but Leo answered: Will be off work soon.\
  \ Here are directions to my place. \n\nAt Leo\u2019s place, his roommate was briefed\
  \ on CS and prepared delicious chocolate con churros: melting chocolate bars on\
  \ the stove, adding sugar and milk, tending to the mixture, checking the consistency\
  \ and sweetness, and garnishing with ladyfinger cookies. He brought out a tray for\
  \ a late night feast. \n\nThe kindness of people like Leo makes the world seem smaller,\
  \ less dark. He completely went out of his way to help, feed, and laugh with me.\
  \ This is what Leo said later: \"She's a really funny girl! She gets lost so easily!\
  \ Be carefull pleaseee do not get looost. I hope you have a great time in your new\
  \ home, and whenever you want you're welcome at my home, wherever I live =)\""
