Text: "Making a personal connection with individuals on a local level is rewarding.\
  \ Regarding travel, people fear the unknown. This is why making local connections\
  \ is crucial in ensuring your vacation is as authentic as possible. The feeling\
  \ of home in an unfamiliar place alleviates the many stresses of travel. It doesn\u2019\
  t take a rocket scientist to know that less stress means more fun.\nI experienced\
  \ this first hand on a vacation in Kimberley. Kimberley, a quaint mountain city\
  \ located in the East Kootenay region of British Columbia houses hundreds of kilometers\
  \ of hiking trails, forty two restaurants, and only one stop light. Those were a\
  \ few aspects of Kimberley that I learned to love. However, a girl originally from\
  \ a big city would look at Kimberley as dead and boring.\nNot knowing anyone while\
  \ passing through a place meant that what you saw was what you got. The fun events\
  \ that bring the city and tourists together go unnoticed. I managed to make a local\
  \ connection by going to eat. That in the moment decision caused by a twinge in\
  \ my stomach led to a friendship that will forever define Kimberley for me. \nNestled\
  \ in the middle of the city is a restaurant called Bear\u2019s Eatery. They make\
  \ comfort foods such as grilled cheese, pie, and fries. All from scratch. The passion\
  \ Bear puts into cooking is evident, and the service from JJ is delightful. I instantaneously\
  \ felt like I had made a friend. She was an inviting friendly individual that encouraged\
  \ us to come back in a way that was genuine and not for the sole purpose of generating\
  \ revenue.\nThrough her, I learned that Kimberley was not just a pretty view of\
  \ mountains and snow, but that it offered a lot more than just a nature fix for\
  \ outdoor enthusiasts. Kimberley is home to some of the friendliest individuals.\
  \ It contained an abundance of culture such as an art gallery, music performances,\
  \ festivals, and markets. The culture did not end with just the artistic values.\
  \ Kimberley is also known for their high volume in sports opportunities. Hockey,\
  \ swimming, and golf, just to name a few. \nWhen I travel, I prefer to stay in each\
  \ destination as a local would. Knowing what to do and where to go to liven up your\
  \ trip. This was all possible based on making one connection. Not only did this\
  \ connection contribute to me enhancing my vacation, it aided in the transition\
  \ of becoming a local myself. As a Kimberley resident, I possess the same mentality\
  \ of paying it forward by making a local connection with tourists just like me."
