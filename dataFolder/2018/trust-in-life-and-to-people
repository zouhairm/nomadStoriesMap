Text: "When I come to country, my impression about it is formed according to the first\
  \ people met. Amazing, but it is the realistic impression. So Scotland was for me\
  \ as a very kind, easy and open country. \nUsually our children travel with us.\
  \ Such trips are planned especially carefully taking into account their small slow\
  \ legs and quickly tired heads. In Edinburgh we booked a hotel across the street\
  \ from the train station. After the trip from London we very tired  and dreamed\
  \ of a warm shower and a soft bed. From Edinburgh we should have gone to Dundee.\n\
  Since we didn't see the sign signifying the hotel, we didn\u2019t even know which\
  \ door to call. We decided to call all the doors, but it is didn\u2019t open anywhere.\
  \ The son was sadly sitting in his pram, our daughter tried to reason out loud,\
  \ and my husband, feeling responsibility for us, began to worry. I, without ceasing,\
  \ rang the doorbell until a smiling young man appeared in it. \"Hi! - I started\
  \ the conversation. - This is a hotel? Can we come in? \". It was a traveler from\
  \ the Netherlands. He let us in and began to respond to our questions. We stood\
  \ in a hotel that looked more like someone's beautifully tidy apartment. The staircase\
  \ under the light carpet went to the second and third floors, on both sides of the\
  \ hall were large living rooms with soft sofas and beautiful fireplaces. It turned\
  \ out that the reception and staff isn't here, and the guests are left to themselves.\
  \ We dragged all our belongings to the hall and began to call to owner. But everywhere\
  \ we heard only an answering machine. \"If none of the staff comes, you can stay\
  \ for the night on the sofas\", - the Dutchman prompted us. My husband's eyes became\
  \ so large after these words, the children happily took off their shoes and ran\
  \ around the rooms, and I said with a smile that this would not be the worst option\
  \ for us. What happened was like a joke on us. Perhaps, it was so. And fate decided\
  \ to show us that we don\u2019t need to plan your life so carefully, and the people\
  \ around us will always help us. Soon the Dutchman was able to call the owner, who\u2019\
  s immediately came to us panting and with many apologies. He cursed himself for\
  \ his stupidity and forgetfulness for a long time, because he didn\u2019t inform\
  \ us about the special box for keeping the keys, and didn\u2019t even put them there\
  \ for us. In finally we were given a large warm room, in which beds were already\
  \ set up for us and we can drink a tea. It is has been the most peaceful and pleasure\
  \ night while the trip."
