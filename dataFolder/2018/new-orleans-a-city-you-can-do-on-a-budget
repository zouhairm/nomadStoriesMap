Text: "When I made the decision to travel to New Orleans, Louisiana, for my 45th birthday,\
  \ I never expected to be laid off of the position I had just a week prior to my\
  \ trip. Because I would lose a lot of money, I decided to go anyway. I am so glad\
  \ I did. With less than $200usd for spending for the week, I was quite worried about\
  \ how I would eat. I knew I was staying in the French Quarter but I did not know\
  \ very much about pricing for food. At least my accommodations were covered. As\
  \ this was my first trip back to the US in 20 years and I was traveling alone, I\
  \ was also worried about safety. However, I did have a friend who had joined me\
  \ on my first day there, and another friend who did live close by in Metairie who\
  \ met with me and showed me some of the sites.\n  Upon my arrival at Hotel Provincial,\
  \ I was greeted by friendly staff and beautiful sites. The valet answered any questions\
  \ I had about the area. When I inquired about a grocery store, Dave gave me directions\
  \ to one. I bought some fruits and other food items that would last for the duration\
  \ of my visit, keeping it in the fridge that was supplied in my room. Dave also\
  \ had some nice recommendations about site that were free to do or see. The Newcombe\
  \ museum is quite the piece of Canadian and US history. All they ask for is a donation.\
  \ \n  There are many historical plaques all over the French Quarter, on buildings,\
  \ fences, etc, that one can see when walking about the area. Of course, there is\
  \ the French Market and numerous other shops where one can spend a lot of money.\
  \ But, the best thing was seeing the people, reading the history, and the food...\
  \ You think you would spend a lot on eating out. Not there. Everything is in large\
  \ quantity for a small price. If you go to BB King's Restaurant & Bar, you will\
  \ spend a lot on one meal but, if you are on a budget, watch the pricing. Most of\
  \ the establishments have a menu at the sidewalk. Cafe du Monde is a must for coffee\
  \ and beignets. If you are lucky, you will see Brother Hank performing outside.\
  \ \n  This city is beautifully captivating and, when one is on a short budget, extremely\
  \ do-able. The people. The music. The history. The food. All call you back for another\
  \ visit. It whispers in your ear, \"Laissez le bon temps rouler.\". I can't wait\
  \ to return and see more."
