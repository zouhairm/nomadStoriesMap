Text: "For a place to travel for everyone I recommend Georgia. Country where everybody\
  \ will find something for themselves. You want to party? Tibilisi is great place\
  \ for that. Mountains? Kaukaz is beautiful. You want swim in the sea? The Red Sea\
  \ is waiting for you.\n However best of Georgia are Georgian people, which were\
  \ the kindest I ever met. First time I had occasion to understood it was when my\
  \ friends and I met local Georgian people in the park. Even though they could barely\
  \ speak English, they invited three random guys from Poland, to their house and\
  \ make special party calling to all of their friends. They even woke up their parents\
  \ who prepared supper for us at 11 p.m. Later that night, thanks to new friends,\
  \ we had an occasion to be part of a special ceremony where Orthodox priest give\
  \ us a blessing and make with us the ritual of drinking \u201Cchacha\u201D from\
  \ special designed horn which is kept for such occasion by the native Georgian people.\
  \ We started to feel bad because of their hospitality, when they had started to\
  \ give us gifts. And not like one thing, we get back to the hostel with bag full\
  \ of gifts from them because they didn\u2019t understood word \u201Cno\u201D. That\
  \ was first situation for me when the kindness were overwhelming in such way. The\
  \ second time we felt it was when we were hitchhiking, which take some time when\
  \ you travel in three guys group. After a half an hour of waiting the man who stopped,\
  \ told us that he will help us but first he want to get to know who we are, we went\
  \ to his farm, have drinks with him and he even made us to collect apples and pears\
  \ so we would have something from him to take back to Poland. \n I could write this\
  \ essay with title \u201CMaking a local connection\u201D and just write all the\
  \ times when Georgian people where treating random tourists from Poland like long-unseen\
  \ family members, but it wouldn\u2019t have any insight value. One of things I learned\
  \ which was surprising for me coming from big European city was the hospitality\
  \ of those people. The word \u201Cpadar\u201D which mean gift had special power\
  \ in their country and you couldn\u2019t say \u201Cno\u201D to it because they pretend\
  \ to don\u2019t understand concept of denying of a gift. After this experience I\
  \ started thinking if I was created in culture with the values and which would make\
  \ me behave the same great way. I think this is  the last thing I expected, that\
  \ I would start questioning my own hospitality and goodness after meeting people,\
  \ which I would never met again and which made my holiday special."
