Text: "Last night I left my home, flew over a thousand galaxies to a world I have\
  \ never been to. The wind carried me on its arms like a baby. It felt peaceful.\
  \ \nWhen I\u2019d gone past the earth\u2019s pull of gravity, I floated around like\
  \ a balloon. The stars each greeted me with a special twinkle. My star \u2018cookie\u2019\
  \ was the brightest of them all. Glowing at me affectionately, I felt like the only\
  \ lady in the galaxy. He let me sit on his planes, feeling his smooth, fine edges.\n\
  We connected silently & when our hearts were content, he let me go.\nThe current\
  \ carried me to where destiny had called. Like a little package, I was deposited\
  \ onto a new planet. Here, my feet touched the ground.\nMy eyes roamed the expanse\
  \ of the planet, searching for life. Then I saw him. This awkward fella, with an\
  \ even more awkward walking style. His head was swinging sideways as he came in\
  \ my direction. I noticed that his eyes were planted on the sides of his head. \n\
  His striking smile didn\u2019t waiver as his right eye met mine, locking gazes.\
  \ I couldn\u2019t help smiling back, its warmth radiating through my entire being.\
  \ I felt neither fear nor doubt.\nHe then turned to look at me with his left eye.\
  \ It was different. This one had long elegant lashes that batted at me almost flirtatiously.\
  \ \nWhen he stopped, he was right in my face & needless to say, in my personal space.\
  \ I took a small step back, and he took one with me. \nI laughed out loud, and so\
  \ did he\u2026 Except that his laughter was akin to the sound of an orchestra! I\u2019\
  d have done anything to make him laugh again, just to hear that sound. \nThough\
  \ he hadn\u2019t spoken out loud, we were communicating. \n\u2018I\u2019ve been\
  \ waiting for you my friend. I am Roaman\u2019 his thoughts said. \nWe sat down\
  \ & spoke with our thoughts for hours. I told him about conscience, the human heart\
  \ & of heartbreak.\nA human can cry & laugh at the same time. Within us, we can\
  \ tell right from wrong. But some have learned to ignore the conscience. \n\u2018\
  Aaah. And you, do you ignore your conscience?\u2019 \nHonestly, sometimes I wish\
  \ I could. Because, oftentimes the wrong thing comes easier & feels good.\n\u2018\
  Strange beings humans are,\u2019 he thought.\nTrue. But that\u2019s what makes us,\
  \ us.\n\u2018You are fading. I see right through you.\u2019 \nGuess I have to go,\
  \ morning is coming.\n\u2018Will you come again?\u2019\nIf destiny calls. You can\
  \ visit. \n\u2018Can I really?\u2019 he smiled.\nI think so. \n\u2018How will I\
  \ find you?\u2019\nThe same way I found you. On the current of destiny\u2019s arms.\n\
  \u2018You\u2019re fading. Here, take this warm smile. Keep it with you always.'"
