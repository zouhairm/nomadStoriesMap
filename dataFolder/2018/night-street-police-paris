Text: "It was a Disneyland day and in the evening we took a Sienna river boat trip.\
  \ Slowly, Paris was embracing the dusk... Overwhelmed with emotions, we ran to catch\
  \ Metro, the local underground train. We were rushing and dashing, not really knowing\
  \ how to get to our hotel. Young and careless, was there anything unusual in us\
  \ losing the note with address and transportation route?! That night was the night,\
  \ no matter what we had to get to our place to continue our journey next morning,\
  \ leaving Paris with the rest of the group. Young and careless, with our fortunes\
  \ yet to be made, we boarded Metro. The sense of relief was about to take over,\
  \ when the train suddenly stopped! We stepped outside, back to genuinely French\
  \ surface, with relating no meaning signs, posters and people. Desperate inquiries\
  \ didn\u2019t shed any light; our tiny temporary residence was far and away. Our\
  \ knowledge of French was far from beginners\u2019, their understanding of English\
  \ was hidden away. With every click, the phones were rapidly dying. An old stylish\
  \ fellow,  wearing\nexquisite light green suit and a bright red tie suggested the\
  \ bus he was confident was supposed to take us home. After half an hour of chasing\
  \ highways, the best bet was to get off and seek for an advice. The policemen seemed\
  \ to have been the best candidates however we spoke different languages. Would you\
  \ let me use your phone if I were to offer few euros?! Probably not, but we kept\
  \ bidding. Neither police nor other people were willing to take the phone operator\u2019\
  s risk. We are hopping on a bus again. Another high speed, RATP trip to another\
  \ dead end. Final stop, Paris already deeply asleep, with nobody around. Which winding\
  \ road leads to the hotel, where all of our belongings are? We were in the desert\
  \ of the Parisian suburb, feeling insecure about the looks from the dark. What to\
  \ do next? But suddenly, there was a light, there were lights \u2014 red, blue and\
  \ white \u2014 police car was better than empty darkness. I realized this was the\
  \ only chance and I had to make a decision that pushed me to the edge. I was afraid\
  \ of police at the time; one wouldn\u2019t trust the men in the uniform in my home\
  \ country. I came out on the road and blocked the way. Was this desperate enough?\
  \ Enough for the honored officers to get in touch with the consulate and find out\
  \ the address our accommodations. We were taking a ride across the Paris in a police\
  \ car, still young and careless, believing in police, people and adventures that\
  \ become part of ourselves..."
