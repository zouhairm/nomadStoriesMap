Text: "Sometimes we focus a lot on knowing what will happen, on how our future will\
  \ be, but we forget to live what is happening to us. We miss opportunities because\
  \ we are too obsessed with what will happen a couple of years from now, or because\
  \ we focus on how others' lives are, and that is the worst mistake that can be made.\
  \ We do not worry about thinking that all we have to do is focus on ourselves.\n\
  \nLive your life. Dedicate yourself to enjoy all the moments and experiences that\
  \ can be presented to you. Do not stay stuck thinking about what will happen later,\
  \ live the present, it's the best you can do for you. \nLife is too short for you\
  \ not to notice the small details and do not allow yourself a break from time to\
  \ time. If you do not try to take advantage of life, when you are old it will be\
  \ too late to regret not having done what you wanted so much.\nDare, enjoy, do the\
  \ things you want and learn from the moment. Love your own and yourself, respect\
  \ others and focus on solving your problems. Do not plan so much, instead let things\
  \ flow and the current will take you where you need to be."
