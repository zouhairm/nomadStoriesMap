Text: "Peru had just won the World Cup Qualifier! Barks from the hostel\u2019s resident\
  \ Irish Wolfhounds were letting everyone know it had become too loud and we all\
  \ agreed we needed to head to the Plaza de Armas, where crowds had gathered to celebrate.\
  \ Cuzco was alive! Locals were waving flags and singing anthems while the police\
  \ force stood idly by. I made it to bed at 4:00 am, slept through my alarm and woke\
  \ up around 9 am with a pounding head. \u201CIt was worth it,\u201D I told myself\
  \ as I began searching for a later train out of Cuzco, only to find there weren\u2019\
  t any available. My heart jumped and I sat up a little taller in bed as I searched\
  \ multiple websites, all with the same results. I was able to find a train station\
  \ in a city called Ollantaytambo about an hour and a half north. I hesitated. The\
  \ train was at 1 o\u2019clock, I didn\u2019t know if any taxi would even drive me\
  \ that far. On the other hand, I risked never seeing Machu Picchu due to the limited\
  \ time I had given myself. \u201CI gotta make it work,\u201D I told myself as I\
  \ punched in my debit card number and attempted to quickly pack. My head pounding\
  \ as I squinted at my phone in the sun; I had about a 30 minute window to work with\
  \ and wasn't sure if I was an ideal passenger. Luckily, Umberto snagged my request\
  \ and pulled up to the curb. I waddled over to the tiny sedan as he called my name\
  \ out of the rolled down window, and I waved, putting my backpack in the trunk and\
  \ sliding into the backseat. He suddenly stopped the car. I fumble to say \u201C\
  Ahhhh, ahhh, no habla espanol.\u201D He sighed and we both began typing in our phones\
  \ to translate. All in all, he was asking how much the service was charging me,\
  \ and would I be willing to pay him directly. I was very confused and typed back\
  \ the amount and asked if my destination was too far. He adamantly said no, and\
  \ began typing back a response. Do I get out? My stuff is in the trunk. Do I trust\
  \ him? Do I negotiate? His phone is back in my hands. Would I be willing to pay\
  \ him directly for the exact same service for the same price? I typed back \u201C\
  You can take me to Ollyantaytambo train station?\u201D and he said \u201CSi.\u201D\
  \ and I said \u201CSi.\u201D He clapped his hands, hopped out of his car, removed\
  \ the magnetic \u201CTAXI\u201D sign from his roof and put it in his trunk. My thirty\
  \ minute window was gone, and I didn\u2019t have an alternative option at that point.\
  \ This is how bad things begin, I told myself as we lurched up the cobble streets\
  \ of Cusco, up and out to the winding road only to be greeted by the Sacred Valley."
