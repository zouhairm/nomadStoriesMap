Text: "It was hot all through the night as we wove in and out of stillborn alleys\
  \ dimly lit by ancient lampposts. The heat left everyone a bit lethargic; second\
  \ guessing this late night venture in want for the sanctuary of their air conditioned\
  \ hotel rooms. We persisted, however, sparked by an immature excitement to witness\
  \ the sighting of a transparent girl or the shadow of a cloaked man. \n\nMy friends\
  \ and I took a moment to stare at one of Savannah Georgia\u2019s most notorious\
  \ houses; a structure consumed by a brooding darkness. Suddenly, the door burst\
  \ open causing us all to scream jumping backward and grasping onto one another for\
  \ dear life. Inching wayward, we peered into the shadows in an attempt to make out\
  \ what had caused the scene. Immediately, we fell into a fit of nervous laughter\
  \ and sighs of relief, as we met the wide eyed equally terrified stare of a young\
  \ man who had been working late on the property. In an apologetic manner, he came\
  \ over to see if we were alright. Apparently guilt ridden, this was the part where\
  \ he invited us in. \n\nObviously, we perceived his devious grin and cautious manner\
  \ as a cruel joke, but he had merely deemed the situation so serendipitous that\
  \ he felt it would be an injustice to not allow us passage well past visiting hours.\
  \ A bone-chilling basement was the main attraction, as he walked us about and finally\
  \ to a glass case where a rusted bag full of Victorian medical tools sat on display.\
  \ \n\n\"This was the doctors kit.\"\n\nThe alleged find appeared genuine, even down\
  \ to the rusted initials etched into its clasp. If proven true, such discovery would\
  \ be pivotal to history hence drawing the attention of paranormal investigators,\
  \ who would be dissecting the home and it\u2019s legend that Fall. And though the\
  \ doctor had been one for saving lives, not a knife wielding psychopath, the fact\
  \ did not shake the disquiet which resides in the home. Nor did it make me any less\
  \ aware of the ghastly presence of death; who remained lurking in this place prickling\
  \ the hairs on the back of my neck as though groping at me in the sadistic need\
  \ to merit a scream. I left the home, with a spirit of oppression latched upon me,\
  \ unsure what I believed in. I hadn\u2019t seen any phantoms, but had felt them,\
  \ and pitied the poltergeist shape they\u2019d befallen. Before parting ways we\
  \ were informed of a terrible truth as his last gift: knowledge of a black market\
  \ of bones. He warned of being vigilant in our walks back, because bones needed\
  \ to be harvested from somewhere."
