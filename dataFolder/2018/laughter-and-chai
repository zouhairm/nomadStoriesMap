Text: "It\u2019s been said that the heart of India is its people. When I woke up on\
  \ my first morning in India, I had no idea that this would be the day that I glimpsed\
  \ the heart. It was myself, my partner Jeff, our four year old daughter Raya and\
  \ our good friend Jess. We imagined some light walking around would help acclimate\
  \ us to the new smells, sounds and culture of India. \nWe followed the street down\
  \ a few residential corridors to a small park. Raya ran in to join the other children.\
  \ We took a seat beside three older Indian women dressed in short sleeved belly\
  \ shirts, long skirts and colorful saris draped over their heads and shoulders.\n\
  A young mother smiled at me from across the park. She was dressed in a long brown\
  \ coat over her flowing skirt and a bright red sari. She confidently approached\
  \ our band of of misfits and introduced herself. Her name was Blessie. She told\
  \ us she was from a city in the southern India, but that she enjoyed the more liberal\
  \ lifestyle of Delhi.\nOne of the older women on the bench got up and then returned\
  \ carrying a tray with 5 beautiful ornate tea cups and pitcher of Chai. The old\
  \ woman carefully poured each of us a cup of steamy fresh Chai. I held the cup in\
  \ two hands and blew into the boiling liquid. \nBlessie translated the Hindi words\
  \ of the old women to us through sips of her tea. The old women never interacted\
  \ with foreigners before. This part of the neighborhood was virtually untouched\
  \ by tourism and unchanged for decades. She was excited to share her tea with us\
  \ and feel like she was touching another part of the world.\nSuddenly, the older\
  \ woman gestured toward my still full cup of chai started to make a bit of a commotion.\
  \ Blessie quickly shot her eyes over to me and asked,\n\u201CDon\u2019t you like\
  \ your tea?\u201D \n\u201CIt\u2019s very hot. I was just waiting for it to cool\
  \ a little.\u201D I replied. \n\u201CYou\u2019d better drink it while it\u2019s\
  \ still hot. It\u2019s best when hot\u201D She said. I nodded and prepared myself\
  \ to drink the still very hot cup of chai. With my lips very tightly pursed, I lifted\
  \ the cup to my mouth and very slowly, very cautiously sipped the tea. The spectacle\
  \ of myself wincing down the sip of hot tea inspired a roar of laughter from the\
  \ old woman, Blessie and my travel companions. I joined in the laughter. \nIt was\
  \ humbling to be laughed at but also uplifting to see how that assortment of people,\
  \ hailing from three different countries and three different generations could so\
  \ easily share an afternoon in the shade of a park and all laugh together."
