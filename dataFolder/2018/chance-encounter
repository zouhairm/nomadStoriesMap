Text: "After traveling solo for six months, I found myself on a water taxi at Abel\
  \ Tasman National Park in New Zealand. On this small boat, someone sits across the\
  \ aisle from me. He looks familiar. It can\u2019t be. I look again. It looks like\
  \ him. It must be a doppelg\xE4nger.  What are the chances?\n\nI have to know if\
  \ it\u2019s him, so I say \u201CMatt?\u201D It is him. It\u2019s a former co-worker\
  \ from New York. I am surprised by this small world chance encounter.\n\nI learn\
  \ that Matt arrived in Auckland a few days before me and is departing a day before\
  \ me. As we say goodbye, Matt asks for my cell phone number. I\u2019m not sure if\
  \ I\u2019ll see him again.\n\nWe end up knowingly crossing paths during some hikes.\
  \ We have similar itineraries as we make our way around New Zealand. And as we make\
  \ our way back to Auckland for our departure flights, we decide to spend our last\
  \ days in New Zealand together. We discussed hiking and going wine tasting.\n\n\
  We hiked the Tongariro Crossing, one of the Great Walks of New Zealand. The forecast\
  \ for rain was not going to deter me. The misty rain and fogginess may not have\
  \ been ideal for enjoying the views, however it added to the mysticalness of the\
  \ hike. During my travels, I was so used to hiking by myself, but I didn\u2019t\
  \ mind hiking with Matt. His eye for observing varying colors in nature enhanced\
  \ my experience through seeing things through his eyes.\n \nAfter completing the\
  \ Crossing, Matt suggested going to watch rugby in Hamilton. I\u2019m so glad we\
  \ went because rugby is New Zealand\u2019s national game and a part of their culture.\
  \ I\u2019m a sports enthusiast, but rugby is new to me. I got a quick Rugby 101\
  \ from Matt. I had a great time enjoying the sport and the fans. If I were by myself,\
  \ I wouldn\u2019t have enjoyed a favorite New Zealand pastime.\n\nAfter Hamilton,\
  \ we drove to Auckland. In Auckland we took a ferry to Waiheke Island to visit wineries.\
  \ Our first stop was a winery that was recommended to Matt. We ended up spending\
  \ a good portion of our day sitting outside on giant beanbag chairs enjoying the\
  \ picturesque view of the Hauraki Gulf and enjoying great wines. Without Matt I\
  \ wouldn\u2019t have found such a great winery.\n\nThe last thing I expected when\
  \ traveling to New Zealand was to run into a former co-worker that turned into a\
  \ travel companion who enhanced my travel experience. Thanks to Matt I see even\
  \ more beauty in the colors of nature, appreciate the game of rugby and found a\
  \ new favorite winery. This solo traveler will always be grateful for this small\
  \ world chance encounter."
