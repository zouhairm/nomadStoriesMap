Text: "The passion and desire to travel has always been in me, but sadly that fire\
  \ didn't explode until I was in my 30's. I have traveled all around the US, but\
  \ nothing on a different continent. I was working for a predominate tech company\
  \ in LA and there was always a constant gnawing feeling in the back of my mind that\
  \ I needed more. That feeling, or desire was a call to action to add some culture\
  \ and adventure to my life. \n\nI quit my job, and made a plan to set off to Cuba\
  \ on a solo 8 week journey(by way of Panama, Belize, Costa Rica). Growing up in\
  \ LA, latin culture was always something that I felt very comfortable with, and\
  \ inspired by. The culture is so rich and the people so giving, plus everyone loves\
  \ tacos. For me venturing off into the unknown was something that I was scared/excited\
  \ for. I felt it in my body, and in my soul that this was the right thing to do.\
  \ Taking that leap and being pushed to the known edge of my personal boundaries\
  \ is/was a sensation I will never forget, and always remember. \n\nI got to Cuba\
  \ before the embargo was lifted so Americans were scarce. I was very afraid that\
  \ everyone would hate me because I was from the US (thanks a lot US media). I remember\
  \ touching down in Havana and having this feeling instantly lifted off my shoulders.\
  \ That feeling was doubt, stress, and fear. I had taken a huge step into knowing\
  \ my true self and what I am capable of. I also got a glimpse of the person I was\
  \ to become. \n\nI will never forget the smells, and the first time I gazed upon\
  \ Havana. The Cuban people were so amazing and accepting. I was able to move freely\
  \ throughout the country pushing my limits everyday. I hiked, swam, bartered, tried\
  \ local cuisine, and mingled with locals. I will never forget one night I bought\
  \ a six pack of beer for some locals partying in the street, they were so grateful.\
  \ Little did I know that tiny gesture was a key that would open up a magnificent\
  \ gate for me. I was taken in by that family and shown the true Cuban lifestyle.\
  \ I ate with them, drove with them, laughed with them, and shared stories(in broken\
  \ english/espanol)with them. It showed me that at our core, people are so much alike\
  \ no matter our differences. By me taking the leap to quit my job, and travel to\
  \ a region or country where English is not the predominate language was the tipping\
  \ point over the edge that I needed. \n\nSince that trip I have traveled to 4 continents,\
  \ and 14 countries. My passion and will for adventure knows no bounds, and I will\
  \ never stop."
