Text: "Some decisions that pushed me: \n16' I was fainted at the end of marathon,\
  \ I first appeared in the newspapers.\n19' After Internet and online game addiction,\
  \ I failed some exams. I changed, gym and running, I became quickly dynamic again.\
  \ Record 27:08 at 7 km run 10 months later. Love and torment. In any case, my girlfriends\
  \ did not forget me.\n22' Summer 1999, I earned 100 USD in a day as a tourist guide.\
  \ It is worth to produce a simple html website with Yahoo Directory linking. I got\
  \ ~50 USD a month in college. The average net monthly salary was just around 400\
  \ USD.\n26' Be rich! A day average of 11 hours work on a computer, without holidays,\
  \ without weekends, without friends. We made the top hotel booking company (agent)\
  \ for incoming guests. Yes! Our company was the most successful online that time\
  \ in Hungary, 2003-2004.\n30' I started blogging. After two weeks diarrhea, weight\
  \ loss. Still alive. When do you realize that this can not go on forever? Hospital,\
  \ Treatments, Therapeutic Massage, Chiropractor. After a few slaps in life. I lost\
  \ my company and lived with my mom for over a year.\n36' Hungary: No job, no money?\
  \ No problem, I'm settling down in the West. I was a future dreamer. Thousands were\
  \ evicted. Millions have moved out to the West that time. They travelled on the\
  \ endless highways next to me, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Romania, Hungary, Albania and\
  \ Slovakia, etc. The same situation at airports but Spanish, South American, and\
  \ everyone. Hey!?\nAustria and Bavaria: 22 months with a strange closure (Refugees'\
  \ top time). It does not matter, I have enough money, and summer is coming. Let's\
  \ me see what are life's gifts! And life gived a lot! But I went down to the bottom\
  \ of the digital full-nomad existence. Almost nothing but electricity and mobile\
  \ net! After 4 months at the end of the forest, nature is overwhelmed, there are\
  \ no helping people there. It's not a simple life. I became ill. Hospital: MR, X-ray\
  \ examination. I did not want to so deep. I could not pick up a pair of pants on\
  \ my own, hurting me all.\n2017: Meeting happy and young people, couples in eco-villages.\
  \ After 5 years' break, I bought airplane ticket again, and in less than 4 months\
  \ I got four more. Visiting bio, permaculture gardens / farms in Teneriffe (Canary\
  \ Islands) for 13 weeks.\n2018 Optimistic: Meeting digital nomads, inspirational\
  \ stories. Language teachers and freelancer consultants. Life has many kinds of\
  \ surprises. I have already flight tickets for 10-18 May: 25th country."
