Text: "There was nothing that could have prepared me for the adventure that I was\
  \ about to have.\nAt 4:30 am on the Chiavari platform, the cool Mediterranean breeze\
  \ found me huddling with two other nannies I had only met a few weeks before. Welcoming\
  \ the approaching train we stepped onboard into a carriage so cold that it could\
  \ double as a meat freezer. The next carriage was so suffocatingly hot it felt like\
  \ a barbecue, so channeling Goldilocks, we settled for another that was just right.\n\
  Two hours later the loudspeaker issued advice that due to a delay, anyone with a\
  \ transfer should seek a second option. Our response was pure panic until two young\
  \ Canadian girls interrupted our less than calm attempts to find a solution, with\
  \ the good news that they too were traveling to Venice and had the situation in\
  \ hand. Turns out they were also nannies and lived in the town right next to ours.\
  \ After an hour of discussion, we had come to the realisation that there was no\
  \ plan B for us and our only hope to make the transfer was to run to our next train.\
  \ Gearing up to sprint through Milan Central Station, we pushed past locals and\
  \ tourists and ran from one end of the station to the other, only to find our train\
  \ peacefully sitting at its platform in no rush to leave.\nArriving three hours\
  \ later in Venice, we parted ways with our new friends, clumsily boarding an overcrowded\
  \ boat headed for St Mark\u2019s. Not the most glamorous arrival in this amazing\
  \ city but we made it! Now to find our hostel, drop our bags and go exploring.\n\
  Day turned to night as our Canadian friends joined us to spend the night dancing\
  \ on tables and under rainbow lights. As we left the club the sky became bright\
  \ and the air warm. Sitting on the edge of the path and dangling our feet over the\
  \ edge we let the turquoise water kiss the ends of our toes. Without a second thought,\
  \ one of the girl\u2019s stands up and takes a running leap into the Grand Canal\
  \ of Venice. A sure way to cure a bad hangover. I separated from the group and sat\
  \ beneath the Santa Maria Della Salute. I thought about how I had never expected\
  \ to live a life like this, to have these experiences and meet the people that I\
  \ had met. It was pure luck that I met any of the friends that I had made, and for\
  \ those couple of days that we spent together, we really owned that city, Venice\
  \ had belonged to us."
