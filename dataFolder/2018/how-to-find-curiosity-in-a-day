Text: "The year was 2009, the month was October. It had been 30 years since Cambodia\
  \ had been liberated from the brutalist regime known as the Khmer Rouge and I was\
  \ 21, young, and na\xEFve.\n\nI followed my older brother to Cambodia, knowing nothing\
  \ about it. He had told me on the flight there of some atrocities which took place,\
  \ older and wiser, he always knew more than me. I listened patiently then fell asleep.\
  \ We were going on holiday, what did it matter?\n\nWe arrived in Phnom Penh. Hot,\
  \ sticky, busy and crazy. This was my first foray into travelling. I organized nothing.\n\
  \nIt was day two. We arrived outside some large gates, where were we? S-21. What\
  \ is that? You\u2019ll find out.\n\nWe entered the grounds and I started to read.\
  \ An estimated 20,000 people were imprisoned in this old high school-converted-gaol.\
  \ A massacre against the educated, their choice of torture chamber seemed rather\
  \ arrogant, but then again, this was generally the point of dictatorships.\n\nI\
  \ perused the solitary grounds finding it difficult to actualize what had taken\
  \ place there. It seemed so serene and peaceful, how could this be? \n\nI continued\
  \ to a room on the bottom floor of one of the buildings. It was covered with photos.\
  \ Photos of men and women who were believed to be victims in this very facility.\
  \ Hundreds, even thousands of photos, and pictures of babies, babies who never had\
  \ a chance to live. I stood in shock. And then I shed tears for those babies.\n\n\
  In the afternoon, we silently rode the tuktuk out to the countryside. Next stop,\
  \ the Killing Fields.\n\nNearly 300 people a day were slain in these fields. Many\
  \ of these being transported from S-21, the same route we just came on.\n\nA memorial\
  \ tower of 5,000 dug up skulls greets you as you enter the fields, a sobering and\
  \ dominant feature important in displaying the magnitude of what happened here.\n\
  \nWe were free to look around the grounds, to see the gated pits where mass graves\
  \ had been discovered, to happen upon the tree used as a death weapon against children\
  \ and babies. Most children climb trees but not the poor innocent souls who ended\
  \ up here.\n\nI was struck by the layers of cloth protruding from the dirt everywhere\
  \ you looked. It was the clothing of those massacred, still not decayed. The reality\
  \ of how recent this was hit home. It was just before I was born, and I was only\
  \ 21, I was still young.\n\nIt took 24 hours in Cambodia for me to change my mindset,\
  \ we weren\u2019t there to go on holiday but instead we were there to travel and\
  \ it was my duty to be curious."
