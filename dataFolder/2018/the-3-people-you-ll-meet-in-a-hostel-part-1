Text: "I walked out after my shower in the lukewarm water. Israel, in all its glory\
  \ and perstiance, had the worst water pressure system in the world. But then again,\
  \ maybe it went along with the vibe of the holy land; soft, purposeful and soothing.\
  \ My hair was still wet and there was no possibility of finding a hair dryer in\
  \ a hostel full of boys, so she just shook around like a wet dog and walked out\
  \ into the outside porch of the lazy lovely palace. It was draped in canopies and\
  \ old couches with courdory and plaid and lilac and blue and brown. It Reminded\
  \ me of the production my school did one year, Joseph and the technicoloured dream\
  \ coat. I got to sing the song about all the colours, and fittingly, here we were\
  \ in the land of God. There were patterned ones and plain ones. The shisha was still\
  \ sitting in the middle of the coffee table, with those little plastic induvidual\
  \ tops scattered around it like a beautiful rainbow. It smelt like the sand and\
  \ clean laundry, the two best smells she could think of. There was something belonging\
  \ and homely about the place and even though I was alone and a bit sad, I felt like\
  \ she was safe. I walked to the edge of the balcony overlooking beautiful Jaffa.\
  \ There was a long table with several chairs lining the view, and mags took the\
  \ least conspicuous one, assuming I was doing a good job at remaining invisible.\
  \ But unfortunately, she wasn't. To the other guests at the hostel and to it's owners,\
  \ I resemble a lost soul; I guess my hope stretched past every frown and makes me\
  \ more visible than I will ever realize. They looked at me the way one looked at\
  \ an old movie star. \nThere was just something just so magical about finally being\
  \ present. Something under appreciated, and undiscovered, but beautiful. \nAs I\
  \ sat down with my arms crossed over my stomach and a squint in my eye, I sensed\
  \ someone's presence behind me. \"Enjoying the view?\" Oh no- it was the curly haired\
  \ boy from last night. The one with the unironic trump hat. His air was cut into\
  \ a perfect Jew fro- the kind that made me swoon. I looked up at him, shielding\
  \ my eyes from the pleasent sun. \nAnd we talked about nothing and everything for\
  \ awhile and then I went site-seeing, and I only saw him again on my last day. Sitting\
  \ in a hammock, he peeked at me as I lugged my duffle bag out of the cubby. And\
  \ I left but a part of me will always be there on the balcony, lazy with happiness\
  \ and sunshine and the world opening a window for me."
