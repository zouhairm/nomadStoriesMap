Text: "I joke about Katrin-speak, a language I've developed which is to English the\
  \ same as short-hand is to literature. I speak a handful of languages, and words\
  \ and phrases come up that never quite translate well enough, so, I'm better understood\
  \ by friends and travellers who speak English, French and some kind of Scandinavian.\
  \ Traveling-English exists as dialects, creole English, heavy accents or ESL, and\
  \ the English of many travellers becomes simplified, broken down or downright butchered.\
  \ Even so, I'm amazed by the ability of language to make travel possible, even in\
  \ places where English is a far-fetched dream, and the flexibility of communication\
  \ we have by sharing such a broadly used, loosely-defined language. \n\nMy most\
  \ memorable English language lesson was given in Dominica. A man spouting words\
  \ with made up suffixes and backwards phrases would have been utterly condemned\
  \ by any English scholar, and even quoting him on paper is a tough job that does\
  \ him no justice. I followed every word and laughed until my tummy cramped, even\
  \ though we were just on a guided boat tour of Indian River, and I secretly wished\
  \ he could narrate the rest of the Caribbean Antilles for me. \n\nIndian River is\
  \ a protected area where motorless boats get paddled by slow-talking rastas. At\
  \ the furthest point up the river, there was a small bar serving peanut punch, guava\
  \ wine, and rivergrape wine, aka \u2018fat-pork-stain wine\u2019 (all disgusting,\
  \ unfortunately). Our guide was Gregory, not Jeffrey, because \u201CJefferey is\
  \ J and Gregory is G and they really not so much matching.\u201D He apologised if\
  \ his English was \u201Cnot englishable enough,\u201D but could also \"speak anybody;\
  \ German, French, English - anybody.\" He explained that the bamboo is not \u201C\
  originated,\u201D the sea moss is \u201Cnice deliciously,\u201D the mangroves were\
  \ very \u201Cliveable\u201D and the river \u201Cswimmable,\u201D with no \u201C\
  dangerosity.\" We saw a hummingbird who \u201Cbeat his wings 250 time before one\
  \ second flow.\u201D He took us to a \u201Cpostcardic view with all the good vibes\u201D\
  \ where \"it's nice scenery, nice breeze, nice reflection, nice everything\u2026\
  \ it's just nice to be nice.\u201D \n\nWe thanked him for an entertaining tour,\
  \ grateful to have seen Indian River through his eyes. I began to think differently\
  \ about Dominica, with his new supply of vocabulary, and smiled at him with as much\
  \ warmth as I could, unsure that any words I had to say could have given him as\
  \ much happiness in return. If BBC ever makes a documentary in Dominica, David Attenborough\
  \ has some stiff competition."
