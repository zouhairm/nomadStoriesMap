Text: "Of all the medicines I had to take every day for a good part of my adolescence,\
  \ and young adult life, a little white one that was smaller than a button on my\
  \ shirt was the pill I looked forward the most. It could take away the power from\
  \ my nemesis - the pain, and hand it out to me. \nIt would lull me asleep. It caressed\
  \ my sorrows. It gave me a fighting chance, and soon I began to bend to its rule.\
  \ \nI had spent my days in a room that at times seemed smaller than my fist. Sunshine\
  \ didn't seep through the tightly drawn curtains, and I lay there waiting for something\
  \ to change. \n\nThat something didn't come for me until much later, and by then\
  \ it manifested itself as a black and purple trekking backpack I named Jeremy.\n\
  \nAround Christmas time many years ago, a friend of mine placed a nicely boxed gift\
  \ underneath my tree. He made me promise I wouldn't peak before the Christmas Day\
  \ and that I would follow the instruction card he placed inside. Once I promised\
  \ I wouldn\u2019t, he left and I wrapped myself in Cheryl Strayed's Wild adventure.\n\
  \nOn the Christmas Day, impatient to see what's hiding behind the nice wrapping,\
  \ I crawled outside my bed. A few minutes later, I came face to face with a trekking\
  \ backpack and an instruction card that told me to leap out of my bed and go on\
  \ a 100-foot journey into the wild. And so I did. \n\nMontenegrin wilderness is\
  \ one of those places where one can go should they wish to find inner peace. The\
  \ very first out of 100 steps into the wilderness, was a slow and reluctant one.\
  \ I carried Jeremy on my back, along with a sleeping bag, a tent, a coffee thermos\
  \ and all those little things whose names I couldn't phantom until then. My list\
  \ comprised of 100 things I had to do during the two weeks my trip was to last.\
  \ One of those was written in a red pen. \"Let Pain be your friend. But don't allow\
  \ it to be you.\" \n\nDuring those two weeks, I walked tirelessly, tending to my\
  \ blistered feet in the evening, and packing my campsite in the morning. Jeremy\
  \ became a safe harbour and a kind friend. As I ticked off all the 100 things on\
  \ my list, I felt strong and unwilling to go back to the place where pity was abundant\
  \ and hope was nowhere to be found. \n\nDeath becomes us once we allow ourselves\
  \ to wallow in sorrow that floods us. I often ask myself what it was that I found\
  \ among those four faceless walls, where I hid my vagabond soul. The 100-foot journey\
  \ turned out to be a decision that had pushed me to the edge but had also allowed\
  \ me to find myself."
