Text: "Bang whoosh bang, my head feels like the New York Yankees team are bashing\
  \ into my skull.  Bang whoosh bang, this this most putrid headache of my life. I\
  \ hear giggling. My left eye opens, bang whoosh bang, my right eye opens. I am surrounded\
  \ by washing machines\u2026\nI roll over. Three wrinkly old ladies are starring\
  \ at me from the bottom of a stairwell.\nI wiggle my extremities to check that I\
  \ am not in a dream. I shift my attention to my body; I am as naked as a hairless\
  \ cat in a black room. I sheepishly drag a sheet over my crown jewels.\n\nYesterday\
  \ was a blur. It started out with an icy surf. A large piece wood in a fast flowing\
  \ passage of the Eisbach River has created an aquatic wonderland frequented by the\
  \ small surfing fraternity of Munich. \nShortly after, I was thawing out in my leiderhosen,\
  \ on my way to the \u201COktoberfest\u2019, my lucky scarf wrapped around my neck.\
  \ The mustard from a salty bratwurst ran down the crevice of my big bum chin as\
  \ the fluorescent lights of the Ferris wheel drew me in.\n\nI was coming off, what\
  \ would become, the beginning of the end of my professional surfing career. The\
  \ World\u2019s Largest Beer Festival was exactly what the doctor ordered! \n\nThe\
  \ 10-piece band was stinging my ears with a classic Robby Williams hit. I was table\
  \ top and throwing my octopus limbs around like a weary old gum tree in a category\
  \ 5 cyclone. I swayed between busty, merry, women in their tight dirndls. \u201C\
  Prost!\u201D \n\nI felt a tap on my leg, a pale girl with brown eyes smiled up at\
  \ me with a menagerie of hats on her head. The beer tent \u201CSchottenhamel\u201D\
  \ was the size of 2 football fields and held about 30,000 drunken men and women.\
  \ Somehow, I had been singled out to purchase a souvenir. \nIn five minutes the\
  \ girl had convinced me, I HAD to own one of those ridiculous and expensive hats.\
  \ She was chuffed pocketing my \u20AC14, but in exchange for a \u20AC1 tip, I persuaded\
  \ her to give me her phone number. She disappeared into the crowd\u2026\n\nThe 3\
  \ old ladies went about their business folding sheets and towels. I make my way\
  \ upstairs to find myself in the lobby of my hotel\u2026 The manager smiles when\
  \ he sees I have resurfaced from the basement. \nMy flight home leaves in 2 hours.\
  \ I rush to Munich Airport dazed and confused. I am trying to piece together the\
  \ Rubik\u2019s cube of all hangovers. As the engines whir in preparation for take\
  \ off, I stare at ten digits written on my forearm.\n\nI had no idea in that moment,\
  \ that those 10 digits would change my life forever. They belonged to my future\
  \ wife."
