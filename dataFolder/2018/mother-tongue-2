Text: "I\u2019ve always thought of Spanish as an on-again-off-again romance: the lifelong\
  \ boyfriend whom I will never marry. I tell my sister this, and she laughs. \u201C\
  Story of my life,\u201D she says. We were raised in Kentucky by a Colombian mother\
  \ and an Anglo father. Like many hispanics raised in the US, we have a complicated\
  \ relationship with our mother tongue. Growing up, our nightly conversations at\
  \ the dinner table switched from English to Spanish to a glorious bastardization\
  \ of both languages. \n\nFollowing the advice of a family friend, I have decided\
  \ to take an intensive Spanish class in the western highlands of Guatemala. Upon\
  \ arrival at the Lake Atitl\xE1n region, I marvel at the aquamarine lagoon, ringed\
  \ by lush volcanic mountains, the longtime home of the ancient Maya. Fishermen in\
  \ canoes throw nets into the shimmering water. Women wash their traditional clothing\
  \ by the shore. Colorful fabric flaps damply between palm trees, and the deep-blue\
  \ sky stretches on forever. \n\n\u201CI feel like an outsider in Kentucky, but I\u2019\
  m too gringa among Colombians,\u201D I confess to my Spanish teacher, Manuela, on\
  \ the first day of class. We sit on a terrace, shaded by a palm-thatched roof overlooking\
  \ the shining water. \u201CSometimes it is hard to know the difference between the\
  \ Spanish language as a whole and the eccentricities of how my own family speaks,\u201D\
  \ I admit. \n\nManuela nods her head.  \u201CMy children feel the same way about\
  \ Mayan Tz\u2019utujil. They speak in Spanish with their friends, and when I speak\
  \ to them in my native tongue they always talk back in Spanish.\u201D \n\nOver the\
  \ next weeks, Manuela gently corrects my grammatical errors. We spend the afternoons\
  \ looking at the lake and discussing the connections between culture, language,\
  \ place, and power. Language, she points out, is a living history of conquest, loss,\
  \ and the blending of different cultures and ethnicities.  \n\nAfter the first month\
  \ of school, Manuela introduces me to her children. They are shy and polite when\
  \ meeting me but quickly revert to chasing each other on the shore of the lake.\
  \ They don\u2019t need to talk, already fluent in the subtle language shared between\
  \ siblings. I think of my own sister and the languages we share. I have always been\
  \ self-conscious of the Spanish we speak, but isn\u2019t this, too, telling of a\
  \ particular history we share? The wedding of English and Spanish, with all its\
  \ richness and inadequacies, is a narrative of dualities and contractions: our very\
  \ existence."
