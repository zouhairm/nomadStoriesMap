Text: "\u201CWhy do people call you crazy?\u201D\nNam\u2019s dark tan face instantly\
  \ breaks into a subtle smile as soon as he hears my question.  I sense it isn\u2019\
  t the first time.\n\n\u201CBecause I work here full time, every day, for the last\
  \ 30 years without any wages.\u201D  \n\nNam gestures for me to sit down beside\
  \ him, on top of this mountain in the Ninh Binh province of north Vietnam.  \nThe\
  \ mountain is not known for its views.  I am here because I have some time to spare\
  \ after a visit to the nearby Trang An, a beautiful place likened to \u201CHa Long\
  \ bay on land\u201D.  Nam - a small built man in his late fifties - is here on duty,\
  \ as the unofficial guard of an ancient emperor\u2019s tomb.  \n\nWho does that?!\
  \ My curiosity is hardly contained.\n\nI watch Nam\u2019s rumpled hands, slowly\
  \ and regardfully wipe clean the surface of the tombstone.  Offerings of fresh fruit,\
  \ flowers, and a cup of rice wine are neatly placed on the unornamented altar. Incense\
  \ leaves a sharp sweetness lingering in the air, and on the lush greenery around\
  \ us.  There is a sense of peace, a sense of solemnity often found in the backyard\
  \ of Buddhist temples.  There is a heightened relief upon reaching the top after\
  \ 265 slippery steps in ballerina flats.  And then, there is an untitled feeling\
  \ of encountering on that small patch of flatland, an old man sitting by an ancient\
  \ tomb. Alone.  Every day. Rain or shine.  \n\nUp here, it\u2019s easy to forget\
  \ about iPhones and Facebook.  About swiping right or left.  \n\n\n\u201CHe was\
  \ a great leader, unifying the country\u201D, Nam says with a glint of pride.  He\
  \ knows every story there is to know about the emperor, Dinh Tien Hoang.   The man\
  \ was born locally to a farmer\u2019s family, excelled at military tactics, and\
  \ founded an independent dynasty in the 10th century.  He became the first emperor\
  \ in Vietnam\u2019s history.  \nWorshipping the dead, including ancestors and heroes\
  \ is a common practice in Vietnam. It is believed that the deceased has a continued\
  \ existence, and their spirits will look after the people and the land.  Nam takes\
  \ care of the tomb, out of respect and gratitude for the historical figure. Centuries\
  \ and worlds apart, their two souls quietly bonded.  \n\n\u201CI ain\u2019t make\
  \ no history, but this is my way to preserve it\u201D, says Nam as we part.  The\
  \ contentment shown on his face is something I know that my Instagram filters won\u2019\
  t capture in full.  \n\nNam\u2019s words echo in my head on the way down.  A simple,\
  \ unannounced and rich way to live life.   I still think of them, sometimes, when\
  \ modern life throws lemons."
