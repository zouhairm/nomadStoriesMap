Text: "I looked at my boarding pass, then again at the screen. Where was my flight?\
  \ Had I stepped through the wrong security gate and entered another dimension, one\
  \ where my airline's flights don\u2019t exist?\nI sought council in the gate attendant\
  \ of another flight to Milan, who spoke reliably excellent English, and told him\
  \ I needed to go to Malpensa at 17.00. He asked for my boarding pass and without\
  \ thinking I shoved him a piece of paper covered in the colours and logo of what\
  \ was quite clearly a different carrier.\nHe regarded me for a second longer than\
  \ seemed necessary, maybe to check if I was daft or just desperate for giving him\
  \ the irregular boarding pass.\n\u2018Erm, so, this is for a different company\u2019\
  \ he said diplomatically, \u2018I believe your flight has been cancelled\u2019.\n\
  That would make more sense than another dimension.\nI sidled off to the help desk.\
  \ There awaited a trawl of fellow passengers, each exhibiting their own house blend\
  \ of despair, worry and frustration. Rumours were going round of a night in a hotel.\
  \ Other people were saying we had to take a flight that changed in Frankfurt! Whatever,\
  \ we were not flying direct to Milan tonight.\nWe were assured of that by a large\
  \ man in his late twenties who had the look of someone who had dealt all afternoon\
  \ with frustrated customers and was thus on the brink of a nervous breakdown.\n\u2018\
  You can stay in the airport hotel free of charge and with this voucher you can have\
  \ a pizza\u2019, he advised us as he wearily began distributing photocopies.\nNothing\
  \ creates camaraderie like being wronged by an airline, especially when there is\
  \ a potential free pizza in the offing. Having enjoyed a hearty moan with the people\
  \ around me I was now the proud friend of a middle aged Qatari man and a tattoo\
  \ artist from Verona. The Qatari man was anxious about losing his accomodation at\
  \ the other end whilst the tattoo artist grumbled that he had a work appointment\
  \ early the next day.\nHowever, with the confirmation of our place on the red eye\
  \ tucked away in our back pocket, we headed off to our hotel to cash in a voucher\
  \ for one of Stuttgart Airport's finest frozen pizzas. We cut into our thin crusts\
  \ and chatted about our cultures, our jobs, our ideas.\nFor an evening we, a motley\
  \ trio of travellers, rather than dashing in pursuit of work and fun, could put\
  \ our frantic moving on hold. The airport, a place that usually services adventure\
  \ and friendship by shooting people off to mountains and oceans, for once, could\
  \ play host to it."
