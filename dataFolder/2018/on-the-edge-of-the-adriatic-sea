Text: "Since it was forbidden to enter the old town by car, I was told to hop on the\
  \ back of the golf cart; I showed the driver a photo that inspired me to travel\
  \ to the west coast of Croatia. \n\n''I heard this location is not far from the\
  \ hotel'\u201D I said'. In fact it is opposite to the entrance hotel door, the driver\
  \ replied; Under the shock of what I just heard, I said \u201Care you sure we are\
  \ talking about the same spot\u201D; he reassured me with a welcoming smile. Before\
  \ he could even stop, I jumped from the cart and realized that I was only steps\
  \ from the most outstanding scenery in Rovinj; \n\nAfter walking down the ancient\
  \ stone steps and taking several photos, I went back to collect my belongings. The\
  \ hotel was an ancient palace with a beautiful terrace but impatiently I passed\
  \ all this to go out and start my journey. I threw my suitcase down in the room,\
  \ swung open the window shutters and realized that my room overlooked the very spot\
  \ that inspired me to travel here. Even if I had planned it, it would not look this\
  \ true. Originally I thought it was a caf\xE9 but in reality it was a decoration\
  \ by an elegant lady that sold beautiful silk products.\n\nI sat at the table to\
  \ take a picture when I heard; ''you have to buy something before\u201D said the\
  \ owner of the shop; \"sure I will, It is because of this beautiful image, I blindly\
  \ travelled from Casablanca to sit in this very chair\" I explained to her. She\
  \ sets this white table outside her tiny shop every morning and places an elegant\
  \ white table cloth with colorful flowers and one lonely chair, a small white lamp\
  \ and a green vase with a bouquet of white roses. This eloquent table setting between\
  \ two old buildings separated by a set of stairs leading down to the ocean is now\
  \ causing tourists to stop and form a line in order to sit in the chair for a photo\
  \ opportunity. After exhausting my camera with selfies, I decided to move on and\
  \ venture into this former Venetian city and oh yeah, with my silk scarf.\n \nOn\
  \ my way back through the old town, I grabbed my ritual ice-cream and headed back\
  \ to the hotel. I opened my window to see the very image that drew me to here was\
  \ now gone and seemed so dull. It was then I realized that this decision to pack\
  \ and travel Here on was the best decision I made: one; how this image of a little\
  \ table mysteriously could draw me here and; two: it was here that I decided my\
  \ life would forever change in light of this amazing destination."
