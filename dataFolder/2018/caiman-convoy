Text: "Dusk descended over the jungle, the lipstick fuchsias and peach sherbet oranges\
  \ ebbing into more subtle cotton candy pinks and then deep, bruised purples. My\
  \ sister and I sat reverently in our hammocks, tucked beneath layers of netting\
  \ intended to keep insects at bay.\n\u201CSo beautiful,\u201D my sister Jenny murmured.\
  \ Her words hung in the air without need of acknowledgement. This was the effect\
  \ of the Amazon- so utterly removed from civilization that it seemed to be a world\
  \ all its own. \nWe\u2019d survived the 14 hour travel to Libertad, where we\u2019\
  d been introduced to our home for the week: a hut with mattresses and a hole that\
  \ served as a toilet. Electricity was available for 2 hours in the evening; there\
  \ was no wifi. My sister had been elated upon arrival, the extremely rustic nature\
  \ of the place igniting a little-accessed chamber of her soul. I\u2019d mourned\
  \ the very obvious absence of creature comforts for a good 30 minutes before capitulating.\n\
  \u201CWhere do you think Manuel is taking us?\u201D Jenny asked, wiggling in her\
  \ hammock to face me. \n\u201CWho knows?\u201D \nAll expectations had been thrown\
  \ to the wind: we\u2019d canoed alongside pink dolphins, trekked through anaconda-infested\
  \ swamps, and floated on giant lily pads. Our guide for the week, Manuel, had embraced\
  \ our sense of adventure and matched it with the wiles and intrigues the jungle\
  \ had to offer. \n\u201CHe said to wear boots and bring flashlights,\u201D Jenny\
  \ reminded me. \nI rolled my eyes, and Jenny laughed. In the Amazon, every excursion\
  \ required thigh-high rubber boots, extensive protective netting, and flashlights.\
  \ \nOne thorough application of 100% Deet later, and we were ready. Manuel soon\
  \ emerged from the darkness, machete in hand.\nHe led us through the inky-black\
  \ jungle, flashlights bouncing haphazardly as we traversed the uneven terrain. The\
  \ labored breaths of our trio and the squelching of our boots joined the orchestra\
  \ of the jungle as we wordlessly sledged through swamps and over branches scythed\
  \ by Manuel\u2019s trusty machete. When Manuel stopped abruptly, I gazed up. I\u2019\
  d been so focused on the \"path\" that I\u2019d failed to notice the lagoon now\
  \ at our feet. Lightning bugs buzzed lazily; twinkles of light danced in the reflection\
  \ of the still water. Captivating, I thought. Totally worth the trek. Good job,\
  \ Manuel. \nClick. Manuel crouched low and swept his torch in a wide arc, stopping\
  \ when the light hit two glittering, wine-red orbs. My heart lurched as Manuel spoke,\
  \ his words inspiring a thrill of adrenaline.\n\u201CReady to catch caiman?\u201D"
