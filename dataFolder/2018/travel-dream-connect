Text: "Travel is a way to learn, to think different, to grow up. Thailand taught me\
  \ a lot; thanks to its mood, culture, temples\u2026and thanks to trains! I crossed\
  \ Thailand from the North to the South. The Golden Triangle fascinated me so much!\
  \ Can you imagine how it feels being in the middle of three countries on a traditional\
  \ boat? It was exciting! The temples are brilliant, totally golden covered! And\
  \ I fell in love with the traditional markets in Bangkok; they are reasonably known\
  \ all over the world. But my favorite experience was the night I spent in a local\
  \ village, it was on a mountain, deep in the nature, without any electrics: we are\
  \ used to a lot of comforts but we could live perfectly without! I spent one wild\
  \ night even on a deserted island. Imagine to be alone, nature and sea, sleeping\
  \ in a tent on the beach:in the morning the sun colors the darkness with pastel\
  \ shades\u2026Anyway, Thailand is a stunning country, where it\u2019s possible to\
  \ move easily as a backpacker! It\u2019s cheap and welcoming; people are always\
  \ smiling, relaxed and kind.Thanks to temples, culture and mood\u2026and trains!\
  \ Do you remember?Halfway through my vacancy I was in a train station in the middle\
  \ of nowhere, waiting for a five-hour delayed train, singing to kill time. A backpacker\
  \ sitting close to me started talking:Lewis, from Australia.He recognized my accent\
  \ because part of his family was from Italy; he was crossing the world, from South\
  \ East Asia to Europe!I was enchanted:I travel, but I use to come back home before\
  \ departing again! We spent time dreaming on our respective projects. The train\
  \ arrived; we exchanged contacts and each one followed his own way.Months passed:\
  \ I kept traveling while Lewis was crossing Europe in his unique huge trip.I perfectly\
  \ remember us texting about surf while I was in California;I was feeling the freedom\
  \ of western Americans and he was hiking in Nepal!Or while I was trekking the Indonesian\
  \ volcanoes: we talked about the views we saw in different moments of our lives.People\
  \ can be so far and so close meanwhile! I was sure we would never have met again\u2026\
  One year later:\u201DCamilla, how are you? I\u2019m coming in Italy!\u201D. And\
  \ we crossed my country, together! Traveling for me has always been a dream; it\
  \ is a passion, a life style, and more of all it is a way to create connections!We\
  \ didn\u2019t know each other; we just met in a train station in Thailand, and started\
  \ talking.Thanks to Thailand and to its train I had the opportunity to discover\
  \ more about humanity. Starting this travel friendship was the last thing I expected."
