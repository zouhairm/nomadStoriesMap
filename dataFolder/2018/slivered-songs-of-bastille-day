Text: "As afternoon settles into evening, the sunlight cascades a warm, golden hue\
  \ across the land and sea. In the distance, the melody of Mediterranean waves rolls\
  \ in tranquilly. The French slowly make their way home from the beaches with a leisurely,\
  \ rested pace. \nThe breeze, enticing the spirit of gastronomy, sweeps aromas of\
  \ chopped rosemary, parsley and oregano out of window shutters and onto the cobblestone\
  \ streets. \nThe hour of dinner has commenced. Sitting on a beige wicker chair of\
  \ a caf\xE9, I admire the waters of the marina and sip smooth red wine. The waiter\
  \ recommends the \u201Cplat du jour\u201D, and so the selection is made. As I wait,\
  \ the wind plays with the palm trees rustling their lush, green leaflets. Bougainvillea\
  \ wraps the stucco villas and the scent of jasmine lingers in the air.\n The white\
  \ linen tablecloth hugs the small, wooden table in front of me and the cutlery is\
  \ meticulously arranged. A bouquet of sunflowers is centered in the middle, next\
  \ to a candle waiting to be lit. \nFinally, on an elegant white plate comes B\u0153\
  uf Bourguignon. Taking my time, I savour this symphony of a dish. The robust yet\
  \ gentle meat tenderly sits atop a wealth of vegetables. Gleaming pearl onions melt\
  \ on the tongue and simmered mushrooms pair with the light crunch of the carrots,\
  \ all cloaked in decadent broth. Each aspect sings its own distinctive flavour.\
  \ Sharp garlic and black pepper season the dish while chopped, verdant parsley adorns\
  \ it together. As the sun sinks lower, the meal unravels itself in rich elements\
  \ until it is all gone and I find myself restraining to lick the last pieces off\
  \ the plate. Utterly satisfied, I continue to luxuriate in the velvety wine. \n\
  When one travels, connection occurs with nature, culture, locals and food. All equally\
  \ vital and adding more local colour and aroma to the palate of life. \nThe seagulls\
  \ soar overhead, embracing the youth of the night, and on their wings they carry\
  \ the fading blue of the sky. The waves continue to beat endlessly against the shore,\
  \ rolling into a creamy foam. \nAll is calm."
