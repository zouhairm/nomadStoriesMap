Text: "It was dark when we arrived at Tribhuvan airport in Kathmandu after 24 hours\
  \ travel from our home in Japan.  Our friend Shirish greeted us with garlands of\
  \ marigolds and warm hugs. My husband Jos\xE9 and I were thrilled to spend time\
  \ with our friends, but it was showing another piece of the world to our kids that\
  \ gave life and energy to our travel plans.    \n\nWhen it comes to their identities\
  \ as travelers, our kids are each very different.  Lucas is the geography buff.\
  \  He eschews all other subjects in school and has a room covered with maps. Of\
  \ the three, he was the one excited to come to Nepal. It was no surprise that he\
  \ was happy from the moment we arrived.  Elias is the black sheep of the family.\
  \ If he had his way, we'd never have left the States.  We love and accept him despite\
  \ this rebellion.  Emma was the only one who had traveled outside of the U.S. &\
  \ Canada before we moved to Japan, having traveled with me to lovely, and rather\
  \ calm, England.  She's adventurous when it comes to food, but has always hated\
  \ crowds, loud noises and strong smells. Nepal was going to be a challenge.    \
  \   \n \nWe thought the drive to our friends' house would be enough to put her into\
  \ a tailspin of anxiety.  Kathmandu's roads are narrow, dusty, and crammed with\
  \ cars, motorcycles and scooters.  Compared to Japan and the U.S., Kathmandu traffic\
  \ is on another level.  But Emma was far too sleepy to notice. \n\nOur friends'\
  \ home lies on the outskirts of Kathmandu, in the hills.  They have a terrace that\
  \ overlooks the valley.  We woke up to a lovely December morning, little of the\
  \ usual haze, and warm enough for us to have breakfast outside.  We stuffed ourselves\
  \ with parathas and coffee before heading out.  Shirish had enlisted a driver from\
  \ a friend who was out of the country. He was to take us wherever we wanted to go.\
  \  We decided on our first day to visit Swayambhunath, the monkey temple.  \"I hate\
  \ monkeys,\" Emma told us as we drove off.  I sighed softly, exasperated and hoped\
  \ that this wasn't going to set the tone of our entire trip.  But after about 20\
  \ minutes of twisting our way through Kathmandu's roads and traffic, Emma giddily\
  \ exclaimed, \"this is life!\"  She was inspired by the vibrant chaos all around\
  \ us.  That spirit stayed with her throughout the trip.  And it has been more than\
  \ a year since we returned, and she said recently, \"I want to go back to Nepal\"\
  .  I never expected to hear those words.  I smile and tear up even thinking about\
  \ it."
