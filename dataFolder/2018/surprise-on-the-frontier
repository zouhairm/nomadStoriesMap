Text: "We were in Georgia from the beginning of July: a bunch of archaeologists in\
  \ the land of the Southern Caucasus cultures. On Sunday, our leader decided to take\
  \ us to Davit Gareja, at the frontier with Azerbaijan.\nWe left early, that morning.\
  \ The journey on a scratched bus dragged us into the terrible southern Georgia streets,\
  \ between hills and mountains, and also between grazing cattle. We arrive at our\
  \ destination only after hours. The sun was shining strongly, and almost all the\
  \ tourists present that day reached only the monastery on the side of the hill.\
  \ It seemed impossible to do otherwise. \nOur leader, instead, started hiking an\
  \ invisible and almost vertical path behind the monastery. Not properly a simple\
  \ walking through the nature. I hadn\u2019t nor the proper shoes, nor the proper\
  \ outfit, but, at least, I had a fantastic straw hat. \nActually, half way through\
  \ I started thinking if it worth all the effort. The end of the walk was far above\
  \ us, my heart ached and it was so hot I was sure I would faint in a moment. \n\
  Also, we didn\u2019t know what we would have found at the very top of the hill.\n\
  It would have been a surprise.\nAnd what a surprise!\nAfter the last few steps,\
  \ we reached the top, the final destination, the natural border between Azerbaijan\
  \ and Georgia.\nSuddenly, the landscape unfurled in front of us.\nThe whole Azerbaijan\
  \ plain and lakes and hills were at our feet, without obstacles.\nWe were at the\
  \ top of the world.\nSlowly, we walked on the crest, from one side to the other,\
  \ breathing deeply the pure air, taking picture of flowers and sunbathing on the\
  \ different shades of the Georgian mountains, from red, to green, to brown and black.\
  \ \nTo go back, we followed a path on the other side of the hill. We were surrounded\
  \ by thousands of colourful butterflies and, carved on the rocks, different ancient\
  \ churches were there just to be discovered with amazement and patient. They talked\
  \ about a diverse time and about a diverse people, a lifestyle impossible to understand\
  \ for us. A community that had lived there hundreds of years ago, prayed there and\
  \ painted the walls with intense images of saints.   \nWe continued on our path\
  \ with our mouth open, sometimes walking and other times hiking to reach the churches.\
  \ Usually this land is forgotten by tourists, on the edge between East and West.\n\
  This trip was totally unexpected and full of surprises, as the end of it: a pic-nic\
  \ in the middle of nowhere with khachapuri and lobiani, typical Georgian food."
