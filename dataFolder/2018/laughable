Text: "When I moved to Germany I was warned about the behavior of the locals. The\
  \ assumption of a certain stereotype would inflict on me, a southern European that\
  \ hugs, say \u201Chello!\u201D and kisses on the cheek to say \u201Cgoodbye!\u201D\
  . Very quickly I started to dislike the formalities of meeting new people because\
  \ I would feel awkward and royal at the same time: \u201Cwell\u2026 I don\u2019\
  t think being the Queen is that fantastic anymore\u2026 I wish people were warmer.\u201D\
  \ That used to be one my thoughts until one day, without any warning I went to a\
  \ local bakery to buy some fresh bread, since I was still learning German I couldn\u2019\
  t pronunciation the word \u201Cdinkelbrot\u201D (which is a type of bread). My mispronunciation\
  \ created such a laughable environment for everybody around me, including the baker,\
  \ I was left completely clueless of what just happen until somebody explained it\
  \ to me. On that day I\u2019ve decided to test the humor of the Germans and nowadays\
  \ I can say that it\u2019s a pleasure to do stand-up comedy in a country where a\
  \ sense of humor is still judged in some ways but to be honest, the laugh is there.\
  \ You just have to find it."
