Text: "The roads winding through the French Concession of Shanghai are cobbled, lined\
  \ with well-manicured trees, and at night, are lit up by fruit stands under flimsy\
  \ tarps, bursting with foods both familiar \u2013 apples, pears \u2013 and unfamiliar\
  \ \u2013 stinky durian; mangosteen; and lychees still in their spiny pods. Despite\
  \ the cobblestones, cyclists ride at leisurely speeds down the shaded streets during\
  \ the day laden with absurd loads: twenty empty water jugs magically held together,\
  \ 12 foot high cages of baskets carefully constructed around the cyclist\u2019s\
  \ tiny frame, and mobile food stands with grills for frying rice or steaming dumplings.\
  \ It was through this neighborhood that I walked alone to reach a \u201Cgirls\u2019\
  \ night\u201D Pride Party, thankful that the heat had died down after sunset. Shanghai\
  \ Pride goes on in June, with everything from a small 5k race to parties on rooftops.\
  \ Despite the festivities, it was not hard to see that the relationship between\
  \ LGBT individuals and the government is akin to the now defunct \u201CDon\u2019\
  t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201D policy of the US military. While explicit bans on ji\
  \ jian (\u201Csodomy\u201D) were abolished in 1912, it wasn\u2019t until 2001 that\
  \ homosexuality was declassified as a mental disorders. Same sex marriage is still\
  \ not legally recognized, trans people cannot change their gender on legal documents\
  \ unless they undergo surgery, foreign LGBT people cannot adopt Chinese children\u2026\
  in short, the government tolerates, but does not support, its LGBT+ citizens. I\
  \ arrived at the venue alone, overwhelmed by the prospect of trying to make friends\
  \ with strangers in a loud bar. I ended up sitting by a group of young people, all\
  \ of whom chain smoked around our small table and had a conversation I couldn\u2019\
  t follow. Wandering back to the bar, a tall woman with a buzz cut struck up a conversation\
  \ with me in fluent English, eventually pulling me away from our drinks to dance.\
  \ Dancing with Bon, who would become my friend and tour guide over the next few\
  \ days, I felt less conspicuous than at any other point in my time in China. Here,\
  \ there were no old men staring at me, no children ogling, just a room full of queer\
  \ folks all trying to get tipsy and have fun. Never have I been more thankful for\
  \ the wonderful openness and inclusivity of the LGBT+ community than while traveling.\
  \ No matter where we are, we are united by common experiences of self-doubt and\
  \ self-discovery, eager to share our lives with others who have struggled to understand\
  \ their place in the world just as we have."
