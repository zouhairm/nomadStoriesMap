Text: "Oh look at that view! My soul shook me and i just wokeup from a deep sleep\
  \ as i was traveling in those mountains from quite a very long time.I was awestruck\
  \ i was damned and i was just so lost to really realize where have i reached at\
  \ that point.  found myself so deeply in love with this beautiful universe whatever\
  \ i saw,i thought- am i dreaming?  thought i wasnt really moving i thought i might\
  \ be dead asleep or in paradise. I thought well this is what heaven really looks\
  \ like! I wish i could always walk on clouds like this. The view around me where\
  \ i wokeup that morning was full of clouds touching my car, cold breeze, mountains\
  \ all over covered in snow and clouds,those snowy peaks, beautiful lake, waterfalls\
  \ and blooming colourful flowers. Later when we reached the top of about  13,050\
  \ ft i.e Rohtangpass(himachal pradesh, India),  we decided to go on top of that\
  \ one of its peaks, where we played snowball fights. The adventure began when me\
  \ and my cousin took off all the warm clothes off. We both decided to lie down completely\
  \ go downhill by rolling down from that snowy mountain top in our tank tops. We\
  \ both started to roll down non-stop.  Everything was unstoppable:the joyous vibes,that\
  \ laughter,  that adrenaline rush, that adventurous roll, covered up all in snow,\
  \ still we said we gotta go!  In the end me and my cousin shook hands, hugging each\
  \ other screaming hey that was toomuch fun yo! \nOn That day with those feelings\
  \ were the best felt from deep within my soul. How else can i be much happier on\
  \ my special day, wishing every birthday every morning universe surprises me with\
  \ such adventures. I didn't wanted to come back.This picture is just a memory in\
  \ pages Or photographs, but what i experienced will be the memory that wont ever\
  \ fadeaway even if i loose all my memory. Its in my heart now and forever.  \nAfter\
  \ all life is all about getting adventurous, being happy in all the little things\
  \ we do and remeniscing all the goodness that universe offers. Always being grateful\
  \ for this beautiful life."
