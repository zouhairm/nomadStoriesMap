Text: "A backpack filled with the bare necessities, passport and flight ticket in\
  \ hand, I left Paris, the city of lights, for Florence, the capital of Tuscany imbued\
  \ by immortal history and art from the Renaissance period.\n \nAs there is no better\
  \ way to discover a place than to roam around its streets without any specific destination\
  \ in mind, I allowed myself to be guided by the lights along the infinite corridors\
  \ of Bellosguardo. The fading warm colours on walls that have witnessed centuries\
  \ of events, the massive intricate wooden doors murmuring breath-taking anecdotes,\
  \ the swinging pieces of cloth on hanging ropes from one end of a lane to another,\
  \ carried me away to another era. The long walks together with the subtle sweet\
  \ smell of Italiana Cucina opened up my stomach and lead me to a local pizzeria\
  \ where Luigi would keep himself busy with an air guitar in between the input of\
  \ each two pizzas in a wood fire oven. \nLater, in the middle of Palazzo Pitti,\
  \ street musicians came into play. Unleashed on their instruments, they filled my\
  \ heart with sunshine as they played Vivaldi\u2019s Spring. Blissful it was.\nAn\
  \ insight into the Galleria Dell \u2018Academia where I could gaze at the original\
  \ David by Michelangelo and surrounded by his other painstaking masterpieces; Lorenzo\
  \ Bartolini\u2018s astounding sculptures which seemed to silently echo singular\
  \ emotions among more which mesmerized me, awoke the dormant artist inside of me.\
  \ \n\nThe welcoming smiles and willingness of the locals to help me on my way despite\
  \ the language barrier, the grandiose architecture of the Duomo di Firenze, the\
  \ magnificent sceneries of a road trip to Marina di Pisa where time seemed to have\
  \ slowed down for me to admire the sea; all kept me wondering about this land of\
  \ beauty. \n5 o\u2019clock in the morning, a few hours before leaving the city,\
  \ my heart desired a last unique memory to cherish. I put on my shoes, grabbed my\
  \ coat and headed up the hills to Piazzale Michelango. Alone in pitch darkness with\
  \ a light snow in -4\xB0 C, the landscape was thrilling enough to warm my bones.\
  \ As I would see the morning rise and the city waking up to the delicate sound of\
  \ river Arno running free, I felt overwhelmed by a sense of freedom. \n\nFlorence\
  \ kindled the flame inside of me which craves for new experiences. I did not only\
  \ bond with the local people, the culture and the history, I most importantly reconnected\
  \ with myself. I found back the long lost high-spirited adventurer inside of me,\
  \ on the Italian lands."
