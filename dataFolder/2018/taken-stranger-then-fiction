Text: "The frightfully enforcing feeling, of the barrell of a firmly placed 9mm in\
  \ the small of my back.  Not a second was there to me steer questions nor to initiate\
  \ a panic.  \n\nSwitch \n\nI\u2019m also by another man unknown to me viewing a\
  \ iPad with the images of my currently separated husband and my boys being taken\
  \ by him into my home.  If confused this is foreign and not making any sense . \
  \ I\u2019m advised by the duo that if I don\u2019t do as they say in the next few\
  \ hours my family will be slaughtered.\n\nCurrently I\u2019m living in Burnaby BC\
  \ Canada just a fifteen minute car ride to the Vancouver core.\n\nSwitch \n\nWithout\
  \ a struggle due to the fear that\u2019s advising me to listen .  A short drive\
  \ later and not far from an area called Commercial Drive , we are met by 2 other\
  \ men with another car. They give one of the men my car keys which they are now\
  \ in possession of with my other personal effects including purse and phone.\n\n\
  In this car I\u2019m given a plane ticket and instructed I WILL board the flight\
  \ in a few hours. \n\nOnce my car arrives I\u2019m made to drive to the Oak and\
  \ 72nd location and park. Following this a man takes my key with him and leaves\
  \ with one of the other men, the car stays parked.  I\u2019m then taken to the Airport\
  \ where again I\u2019m shown images on an iPad of my residence and told they are\
  \ outside my home and to follow the instructions and nobody will die.\n\nOnce at\
  \ the airport very little time passes until I\u2019m walked to the security gate\
  \ I\u2019m thinking that my awkward behaviour at gate might flag me I\u2019m both\
  \ scared and worried at this point.\n\nI board the flight with reluctance and still\
  \ don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to become of my family and why this is happening.\
  \ Only one day prior I\u2019d been playing Josh Groban and carrying on in my parental\
  \ role with my three sons whom are all 12 and younger .\n\nSwitch\n\nI\u2019m on\
  \ the plane one of the men they met earlier I observe is also on this flight heading\
  \ to Heathrow.\n\nThe passport I\u2019m being shipped with only ever used once prior\
  \ to take me sons to Disneyland only 18 mos prior.\n\nFrom Heathrow the ticket states\
  \ a 9 hour layover and then continues to Johannesburg then a connector to Antananarivo\
  \ Madagascar. My breath slows and I\u2019m feeling overwhelmed and without explanation.\n\
  \nI don\u2019t speak to anyone on this flight full of happy departures heading to\
  \ vacations of pleasure, very unlike me at the time .  Once we arrive in Heathrow\
  \ the man I recognize meets up with me inside the terminal and ushers me to the\
  \ lounge. We stay there and I\u2019m vomiting .."
