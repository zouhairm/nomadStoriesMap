Text: "I'm used to hitch-hike in European countries without money. But what will happen\
  \ if i started to hitch-hike close to my hometown? Would I be disappointed because\
  \ it's not far? Because i didn't spend money in an expensive airplane for a country\
  \ at the edge of the world? \n\_\nTravelling\u2026 If i try to find a definition,\
  \ it's when you go in an adventure, get outside your confort zone (kind of), try\
  \ to explore new way. Even in your everyday life, no? Let's the serendipity happen.\
  \ But you,\_ who read me now, do you know the serendipity philosophy? Trust in chance,\
  \ take a new road instead of the same usually took, go meet an unknow.\_ The life\
  \ always bring you the thing that you need, who will make you happy. If you accept\
  \ to get outside your comfort zone, to trust in the life, to chose the uncomfortable.\
  \ \nI had 1 month in front of me, I chose hitch-hiking with my dog to spice up my\
  \ life.. And what a crazy adventure, or a powerfull and spiritual experiments\u2026\
  \ most beautiful memories of my life\n\_\nOf course sometimes it's hard: no shower\
  \ and courant water, sleep on rocks, woke up by the warm of the sun in the middle\
  \ of nowhere. But nothing in comparison with the happiness\u2026 \nWe discover new\
  \ places in France that we never explore before (even if it's pretty close). Most\
  \ of the time, we slept in the nature: waterfall, the Verdon and Colombieres Gorge,\
  \ we found some huge and amazing lake. We did kayak in natural river, hiking, climbing\
  \ in the mountains. Even, we walk in the highway completely crowded of car, by foot,\
  \ smiling to people waiting in their hot cars. \n\_\nAnd what will be this story\
  \ without humans. We met amazing, wonderful, stunning people in our road. \n\_\n\
  Some people brought us in the most beautiful village of France, only 3 hours of\
  \ our city : Moustier. \nSome other brought us in a small village festival close\
  \ to Ollargues : \"Festibaloche\" 10 euros for 3 days, dogs allowed of course. Natural\
  \ places, open minded young people\u2026 Quickly we took part in volunteering and\
  \ we entered for free. We discover different kind of music, different kind of art.\
  \ Amazing atmosphere, vibes and meeting. \nAn other day, we met a group of punk\
  \ people on the beach, we lived with them during 2 days and all of their dogs (6\
  \ in total). The police stop us the morning and we moved in the urgency center for\
  \ homeless people, for a free breakfast where we met kind and helpfull homeless\
  \ people. We stay couple of hours to heard some interesting stories."
