Text: "In August 2017 I visited Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, with my partner.  Everyday\
  \ I spent there I was more and more surprised by how Americanised it was. From their\
  \ dense high-rise buildings, 7 floor malls and Mon \u2013 Fri; 9 -5pm work style\
  \ to their American products and establishments such as the Red Lobster restaurant\
  \ and their flag, which seemed loosely based on the American flag. The most stand\
  \ out Americanised sight were the Petronas Towers \u2013 their iconic skyscrapers\
  \ towering 88 floors with Tower 3 nearby\u2026 not that different from the layout\
  \ of the twin towers and Tower 7 that had also famously come down, years later.\n\
  Every day I spent there I was becoming more and more convinced that America had\
  \ something to with Malaysia\u2019s history and therefore present whereas my partner\
  \ wasn\u2019t\u2026\nThe whole experience made me realise how little we are taught\
  \ in public schools in the UK about world history and current affairs.  It made\
  \ me finally understand why well-off people in the western people like the idea\
  \ of their offspring to travel the world \u2018to learn about the world and be more\
  \ cultured\u2019.\n\nSpeaking of culture, we also enjoyed some of the best of what\
  \ Kuala Lumpur had to offer.\n    We visited the Batu Caves \u2013 ancient Hindu\
  \ temples & shrines set in limestone caves set high at the top of steep steps \u2013\
  \ where monkeys rule!  Got stuck in a monsoon rainfall \u2013 it was mesmerising\
  \ to watch the rain come off the steep steps to the Hindu temples housed in the\
  \ limestone caves \u2013 it was like watching mini waterfalls. We had our palms\
  \ read on the way back that was lovely too!\n    Petaling Street and Brickfields\u2013\
  \ Kuala Lumpur\u2019s China town and Little India too.\nWe are still yet to google\
  \ and learn online the history of Kuala Lumpur.  \n\nWe travelled using their trains\
  \ \u2013 which was simple to follow and fun to use. \n    Food wise we enjoyed authentic\
  \ Malay cuisine in one of their signature food courts near where we stayed!   If\
  \ wanting food from their street stalls or lofty dining you can expect cuisines\
  \ from a number of different cuisines \u2013 Malay, Chinese, Indian, Thai and Arabic.\n\
  \    Kuala Lumpur also has many religions. Islam accounts for 46.4%; followed by\
  \ Buddhism 35.7%; Hinduism 8.5%; Christianity 5.8%; Daoism 1.1%; and other religions\
  \ 2%.\n\nSo, to summarise the last thing I expected from Kuala Lumpur was the Americanisation\
  \ of such a united multicultural city, in Malaysia. A country that is rarely spoken\
  \ of. An Americanised city where the religion is predominantly Islam\u2026"
