Text: "As a measure of machismo, bicycling through the Orb River valley in southern\
  \ France en route to a cherry festival ranks somewhere between petting a cat and\
  \ using unwaxed dental floss. I was raised to believe there are only two types of\
  \ men in the world: Audie Murphy and effete cowards. When you instinctively compare\
  \ your every accomplishment to single-handedly wiping out a German machine gun nest,\
  \ it doesn\u2019t take long to realize you\u2019re not Audie Murphy. I\u2019ve only\
  \ ever been in two fistfights (one loss, one draw). I can change a flat tire, but\
  \ not my oil. I do drink a manly amount of beer, but they\u2019re usually artisanal\
  \ microbrews.\n\nThe upside of being an effete coward, however, is that you get\
  \ to bicycle through the Orb River valley en route to a cherry festival. I pedaled\
  \ lazily beneath cloudless blue skies, ducked under cherry tree branches sagging\
  \ with ripe red fruit, and explored medieval villages with streets barely wide enough\
  \ for my handle bars.\n\nJust as I began to hear music drifting from the festival,\
  \ a small house caught my eye. It wasn\u2019t like the centuries-old, stone cottages\
  \ I\u2019d been admiring all day. This home was a single-story, pink stucco, 20th-century\
  \ dud. Its roofline drooped. Weeds choked out grass in the front lawn. A rusty tricycle\
  \ poked out of the shrubs. What made the house unique were the five-foot-tall, bright\
  \ orange flames and black plumes of smoke coming from its porch.\n\nDitching my\
  \ bike, I ran to the house. The source of the fire turned out to be a long, plastic\
  \ planter box hanging off the porch\u2019s wood railing. In the middle of the smoke\
  \ and flames, a batch of helpless flowers was being incinerated. I guessed someone\
  \ had tried to put out a cigarette in the box and failed.\n\nI opened the house\u2019\
  s sliding glass door and shouted the only French word I knew, \u201Cbonjour,\u201D\
  \ hoping the urgency of my voice conveyed that I meant, \u201CHello, your house\
  \ is on fire!\u201D and not, \u201CHello, do you happen to know a good recipe for\
  \ cherry clafoutis?\u201D No one answered.\n\nI searched for a pot or a bucket or\
  \ anything I could use to haul water. Appropriately enough, all I found was a galvanized\
  \ watering can. I filled it at the kitchen sink and dashed back to the porch. The\
  \ flower box was now a toxic mess of molten, flaming goo dripping onto the smoldering\
  \ mulch bed below. Then, with smoke stinging my eyes and the stench of burning chemicals\
  \ filling my nostrils, this coward set out toward the fire, just a man with a can,\
  \ ready to rescue some flaming geraniums."
