Text: "45 km in three days. Doesn\u2019t seem to be a great challenge.\nThe fact is\
  \ that not all 45 km are the same.\nYou can walk in the country side or along the\
  \ shore and 45 km can be a great nice walk.\nYou can also decide to make these 45\
  \ km in the Andes, in this case, this length can be something challenging.\nIt was\
  \ February, rainy season, the weather was instable and this fact made the adventure\
  \ even more inspiring.\nThe Inca Trail was, at least for me, one of the must do\
  \ trips in life.\nI always thought that you can\u2019t just go to Machu Picchu by\
  \ bus or by car.\nYou must live, feel and breath the real way the Incas used to\
  \ arrive to that place.\nNature is majestic, every form of it is simply inspiring.\n\
  For an urban guy like me, being able to walk in the wild mountains is an amazing\
  \ experience.\nYou walk on this trail and you look at the horizon that is designed\
  \ by many more biggest mountains.\nWalking in the mountains is an experience that\
  \ make you realize how small we are.\nIncas were tiny but the stairs that they built\
  \ are really high.\nEach step is an effort to a guy like me that has 1,80m, imagine\
  \ for these tiny guys.\nAs you walk through this trail you can feel the history\
  \ of the ancients.\nIt is magical to feel this energy.\nI use to live in San Paolo,\
  \ Brazil, but I\u2019m from Rome, a city that was build thousands of years ago and\
  \ still impresses me and the world with his strength and endurance over time.\n\
  The history of mankind was molded in this stone city.\nIn the Andes, the sensation\
  \ is different.\nThe power of the mountains is all over, the weather and danger\
  \ too.\nYou walk through this trail that has been leaved as it was since was made\
  \ by the Incas so it\u2019s not a touristic walk around, you really can fall down\
  \ from the trail at any time.\nI must say that to make this trail you must go with\
  \ an agency that provides all the needed infrastructure along the journey.\nThis\
  \ is indeed a game changer once you don\u2019t have to make your meals or your tend\
  \ as they are already prepared when you arrive in every check point. \nAll the infrastructure\
  \ is prepared by locals that are probably a resemble of what the Incas should look\
  \ like.\nAlong the trail you are constantly passed by these guys, that run a race\
  \ between them to see who\u2019s going to be the first to arrive to the next check\
  \ point.\nThe arrival to Machu Picchu is in the early morning, before the tourist\
  \ and is astonishing as your first sight of this ancient city is the one made famous\
  \ from the classic photograph of it."
