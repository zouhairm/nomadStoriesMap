Text: "\u201CIt's my dad, Prince Charles, Charles de Gaulle, King Charles Spaniel.\"\
  \ My friend listed similar words but didn\u2019t pick up the call. I enjoyed the\
  \ unconventional use of words and fluency between her languages. Her parents were\
  \ French and Korean and she\u2019d studied in England.\n\"If he\u2019s worried,\
  \ maybe just let him know you're ok.\" Her ID and money had spilled out of the plastic\
  \ bag she'd been using as a purse and lay strewn around us. He probably had fair\
  \ reason to be concerned.\n\"He won\u2019t let me teach music until I take pills\
  \ again.\" She frowned. \"I know! There's a cafe with a blue piano. Barrels caf\xE9\
  , barrows, burrows.\" She spouted multi-lingual chaos and ended by asking me if\
  \ I liked taro.\n\"Yeah sure, taro\u2019s tasty.\" \nJoining the wifi, I had heaps\
  \ of notifications. Three were friend requests. Diana Carol Charlotte Delvinge,\
  \ Jesus Frederick Chopin Charles and a Korean name. All three profiles were my companion\u2019\
  s. I'd also been tagged in statuses where she\u2019d had multiple conversations\
  \ with herself. Some names were composers and British Royalty. Delvinge was the\
  \ model on her vibrating phone screen.\n\"Oh Charles, my spaniel, my prince, mon\
  \ papa.\u201D\n\"Talk to him, then we can go play piano.\u201D\nShe answered in\
  \ loud Korean (for the most part) spinning around the hostel dorm as she spoke.\n\
  We\u2019d met in a club I'd heard about on a dating app, which I use to find events\
  \ and locals in new cities before arriving. I'd been round Seoul and up to the DMZ\
  \ with girls here and they\u2019d all suggested the same club for Saturday.\nThe\
  \ night was a whirlwind of dancing and shots, broken by a solemn cigarette break,\
  \ where my new friend said the last time she was with a man she had been raped.\
  \ That was just before being diagnosed as manic-bipolar.\nShe wanted freedom to\
  \ act without inhibitions and was glad she\u2019d been born south of the DMZ but\
  \ her parents wanted her to be free from harm and knew she was vulnerable.\nOther\
  \ passengers kept their distance on the metro as she performed her favourite classical\
  \ melodies but my friend didn\u2019t notice or care. The same way she strung words\
  \ together, she could match up sections of music.\nHer face lit up when we reached\
  \ the caf\xE9 in Hongdae. I went to order and was greeted by a beautiful (if erratic)\
  \ tune on my way back.\nThere she was, dancing in front of the piano. Her shoes,\
  \ plastic bag and scattered possessions lay behind her. Curtains of hair bounced\
  \ in front of her face as she nodded in time to the tempo she was creating.\nI\u2019\
  ve never seen anyone so free."
