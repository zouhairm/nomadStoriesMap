Text: "The drive from my couchsurfing host\u2019s in Shiraz to the famous Pink Mosque\
  \ was about 40 minutes. They say that in Iran, avoid two kinds of people \u2013\
  \ the Basij militia, and the taxi drivers. With no control over speed, less regard\
  \ for traffic signals than for the American government, no metered fares, and ominous\
  \ absence of seat belts, taxi drivers here are insanity personified.\nGiven the\
  \ final days of my backpacking tour, I didn\u2019t mind shedding the last few dollars\
  \ and going along with this driver, personally known to my host. We began at the\
  \ north-western edge of the city and headed towards the kaleidoscopic buildings\
  \ of the Vakil Bazaar.\nOur discussion began with the usual \u2018How I see Iran\
  \ as a foreigner\u2019 and approached the edgy topic of Islamic extremism. He said\
  \ that for people like him, religion plays a central role in everything they do.\
  \ I contrasted with how I see myself as a human being first, an Indian second, with\
  \ my religion a distant third. Perhaps that\u2019s the reason religious extremism\
  \ comes to the fore more often in his community? He disagreed staunchly. He regarded\
  \ the centrality of religion as the basis for avoiding conflict and fostering peace.\
  \ I could not hide my disagreement.\nWe arrived at the mosque and I handed out the\
  \ pre-agreed sum, which he refused. I had been in Iran for long enough to know what\
  \ taarof is, the courteous refusal to accept payment even when you want it. When\
  \ I insisted for the third time to pay, he refused firmly and got off the car to\
  \ open my door. Half afraid of having offended him twice, I thought it best to insist\
  \ no further and head towards the mosque.\nBut he wouldn\u2019t let go. He took\
  \ me by the hand towards the back entrance of the mosque, which was for the worshipers.\
  \ He led me to the main prayer hall, away from the tourists, and straight to the\
  \ Mullah who was about to start his sermons. He said something to the cleric while\
  \ I heard my own heartbeat. The cleric turned to me, smiled, and embraced me as\
  \ \u2018brother\u2019. I was invited to sit and listen to the sermons. I made friends\
  \ from that lot of faithful, with half a dozen offering me to stay at their home.\
  \ Since I couldn\u2019t offend my existing host, they insisted I eat at their homes.\n\
  Over the course of the day, I had meals at two of my new friends\u2019 and went\
  \ back at night to my host. He and his wife were furious for my not dining with\
  \ them, so they made an extra-large spread for the next breakfast.\nThey also say\
  \ that hotels in Iran don\u2019t do great business. Understandably."
