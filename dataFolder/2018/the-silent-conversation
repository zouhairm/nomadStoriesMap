Text: "\u201CHe says he is happy that you like his suja\u201D Tashi added with a smile\
  \ as she sipped her own cup of butter tea. My guide in the land of happiness, she\
  \ had been with me for the past ten days as I travelled through western Bhutan.\
  \ She had to pull some strings to get me what I had requested of her: sharing food\
  \ with a monk in the Cherrey monastery.\nWe hiked for over two hours to reach the\
  \ monastery. I had put down my bag feeling relieved and was taking sips from my\
  \ water bottle when Tashi told me that the monk\u2019s house was another fifteen\
  \ minutes climb uphill. Flights of precarious steps followed and his house emerged\
  \ into view, perched on the steep slope.\nDraped in deep maroon, Phurba Tsering\
  \ looked at me with comforting eyes. His face looked calm, oblivious of the austerity\
  \ of his daily life. I bowed to him and he replied with a slight bow of his head.\
  \ I joined him on the floor. He spoke neither English nor Hindi, the languages I\
  \ spoke and so I remained silent. Tashi would be the medium for our conversation.\n\
  We sat in the section of his house which served as the living room and measured\
  \ hardly six feet on either side while the other two were the kitchen and the meditation\
  \ room. There were no chairs or tables to be seen anywhere. There was a statue of\
  \ the Buddha lying in the centre of the meditation room where candles glowed behind\
  \ the thin curtain. The aroma of incense filled the house.\nLunch was laid out on\
  \ the wooden floor. Red rice, ema datsi-the Bhutanese preparation of chillies cooked\
  \ in cheese-and curried meat. I could feel the hunger gurgle in my stomach. The\
  \ monk had cooked all the items himself and offered me the bowl of rice which I\
  \ took as the cue to begin the meal.\n\u201CDo you eat beef?\u201D Tashi asked me\
  \ as I lifted my spoon to eat. The monk\u2019s eyes met mine. They seemed earnest\
  \ and hesitant. I had not realized that the curry had beef. I am not religious but\
  \ I am a Hindu and had never eaten beef until that moment.\nTheir eyes were fixed\
  \ at me. I looked at their faces and at the dark curry that lay in front of me.\
  \ A thin layer of steam floated in front of my eyes, my mind felt clear and all\
  \ my inhibitions seemed to vanish. The food was a lesson, a hidden blessing from\
  \ the monk. It was a part of his life that he had humbly extended for me to share\
  \ and its simplicity reflected his own. The Buddhist tradition of sharing and accepting\
  \ whatever is offered dawned on me in its truest sense.\n\u201CLooks really tasty\u201D\
  \ I said and I took another ladleful of the curry."
