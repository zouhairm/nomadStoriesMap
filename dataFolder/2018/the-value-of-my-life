Text: "We were sat on plastic chairs, trying to force ourselves to have at a spoon\
  \ of ph\u1EDF ; the traditional rice noodle soup. It could have been anticipation\
  \ that had our hunger fade out, perhaps we were overwhelmed.\n\u201CWe\u2019re going\
  \ to die, brother,\u201D Vinicius said. This Italian has been a part of my journey\
  \ for less than a week, and yet we were inseparable. Maybe because he was a complete\
  \ opposite, maybe because he was just as mad.\nSince we had exchanged our first\
  \ few words on the airport arriving here, I knew that if I\u2019ll do this with\
  \ someone, it has to be somebody equally insane.\nLooking at the chaotic waves of\
  \ motorbikes merging into the traffic, I could hardly imagine being a part of it\
  \ - but the decision was already made and our minds were set on it; in a few days\
  \ we were about to drive through the mountain roads north, to Hanoi.\nTwo days after\
  \ we bought cheap motorcycles, we had made our way all the way from Hoi An, a beautiful\
  \ UNESCO world heritage site, whole way to Phong Nha where highway became a rough,\
  \ barely paved road.\nA part of the way between the two became famous in 2008, when\
  \ Top Gear show released a Vietnam Special, however, they seemed to avoid the inland\
  \ area, where the roads are not as well taken care of and the landscape offers more\
  \ than nice beaches.\nThose were the roads for more daring and they pushed us over\
  \ the edge. The desire to move fast has overcame the necessity to be careful and\
  \ copying the habits of locals we forgot all about the rules of driving.\nAnd then\
  \ it happened: I was keeping up with the cars in ahead, when a scooter stopped in\
  \ front of me. With a truck on my left I had nowhere to go and in the next moment\
  \ a loud crash has pierced through the constant noise of honking.\nIt comes to no\
  \ surprise that Vietnam has hundreds of thousands of traffic related accidents and\
  \ a significant amount is never reported, such as in my case. Apologies were said\
  \ and some money to cover the damage was given.\nNo one cared, as it was something\
  \ seen every day.\nWhy do we think of our lives as so precious in some societies?\
  \ I asked myself when I was sharing a meal with the mechanic before I sat back on\
  \ my bike.\nIn the country that has more deaths on the road than of pandemic diseases,\
  \ and motorcyclists account for more than half, is life not worth the same?\nThat\
  \ day, I realized something. Feeling alive is easy when you keep pushing yourself\
  \ towards the limit; but being smart and knowing where the limit is makes you be\
  \ able to tell the stories."
