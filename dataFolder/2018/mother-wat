Text: "I was sweating. The temperature was hovering around 90 degrees and the humidity\
  \ kept my elbows sweaty.  The orange dirt of Siem Reap, Cambodia rose up around\
  \ the spinning wheel of the rickshaw. The beehive towers of the temple loomed above\
  \ the shining moat. \u201CJessIcA? Oh there you are.\u201D My mother stood in her\
  \ newly purchased 2 dollar elephant harem pants, white sun hat, waving her hand,\
  \ \u201CWait for me.\u201D The ancient tales of Ankgor Wat had a less complex history\
  \ than the relationship I had with my mother. Yet, somehow at 73, she was staring\
  \ with me at the same decaying sandstone structure among a throng of perspiring\
  \ tourists. One-thousand elephants are said to have moved the pale bricks to their\
  \ current resting place. My slow heavy feet are also moving, hesitantly and purposefully\
  \ towards the entrance of the temple. If a stone step was wobbly under me, I waited\
  \ and watched my mother\u2019s foot securely journey over it. Apsaras followed and\
  \ observed us like shadows along the temple walls. Each female waved, winked and\
  \ tilted their speckled heads in curiosity. We walked by a long dusty corridor of\
  \ windows and doorways, light was filling the space, seeping down the broken brick,\
  \ \u201CWait, I want to take a picture of that.\u201D We stepped together on stone\
  \ shards towards the inner structure, passing more corridors longer brighter than\
  \ the one she photographed. \u201CWait. this one too.\u201D A queue of people trudged\
  \ slowly closer to a staircase. \u201CYou want to go up and see the view?\u201D\
  \ She stood as still as the stone Vishnus. \u201CYou don\u2019t want to miss it.\u201D\
  \ She glared at the sunglasses and hats waiting in line.  We edged our way to the\
  \ back of the line of modern visitors, where ancient beehives towered over their\
  \ sweating faces. Waiting took less time than expected, we were quickly brought\
  \ to the bottom of a steep splintered staircase. \u201CHold on\" We were ascending\
  \ into myth with each trembling step of the stair, when I heard, \u201CUGH going\
  \ down will be brutal.\u201D I took a deep breath and thought of the mindfulness\
  \ and pride the priests held as they reached the summit of the tower. How at sunrise\
  \ the peaks where kissed by the burgeoning light and the calm before the bustling\
  \ of ceremony arose. I separated from my mom and weaved around pillars of Apsaras\
  \ and posing portrait-takers on ledges. I found an empty window. Crumbling stone\
  \ on the ledge. Mesmerized, I was beginning to form a thought when I heard, \u201C\
  Oh this was worth it\u201D and we stood silently, feet on uneven stone, awed at\
  \ the view below."
