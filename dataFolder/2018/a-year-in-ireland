Text: "I will be honest. I am not good at writing fictional stories. I will therefore\
  \ share my experience of this past year.\nA year ago, I packed my bags and moved\
  \ to Dublin, Ireland. I knew no one here, and I had never even visited before. I\
  \ only had an idea of what it might be like. As a child when I moved cities, states,\
  \ and countries, I learned to firmly plant my roots in new soil and bloom from there.\
  \ I followed this strategy, and in these past eleven months, Ireland has felt more\
  \ like home than any other place I have lived. \n\nMy time here has been focused\
  \ in making a sincere connection to this place. I have made close friends, become\
  \ deeply involved in an artist collective, where I organize events and teach courses.\
  \ I have covered the island by foot, bus, and train from north to south and east\
  \ to west, I have hiked Ireland\u2019s highest peaks and swam in its most frigid\
  \ waters and have wandered country roads through rolling green hills. I have listened\
  \ to the sweetest folk music in small town pubs where everyone knows each other\u2019\
  s\u2019 name, and the Guinness pours until the sun comes up and the church bells\
  \ ring. I have fallen in love and experienced devastating heartbreak. Whatever the\
  \ experience, I remind myself everyday to \u201Cnot just exist, live\u201D.\n\n\
  There is one human who I would say has shown me Dublin in a more intimate way. I\
  \ had first seen him perform by chance on my birthday back in May and I immediately\
  \ fell in love with his spoken word and captivating mannerism. I read and listened\
  \ to his poetry for months and thought about emailing him to ask if we could meet\
  \ him for coffee and learn about his process. I never did. Six months later I spotted\
  \ him in a caf\xE9. I still said nothing, but kept reading his work and watching\
  \ him perform. We later matched on a dating site and went for a pint. From there,\
  \ our friendship grew.\n\nHe took me on late night walks through the neighborhoods\
  \ he grew up in, noting the differences, sharing his memories. He sang me old Irish\
  \ folk songs and recited his poetry about his life in the inner-city communities.\
  \ We drank Guinness in pubs that only locals appeared in, where we listened to Dublin\u2019\
  s most talented musicians. He told me about tossing back cans on the Canal Royal,\
  \ watching football matches at his local club, the boxing ring he frequented for\
  \ practice as a boy. He told me about his family and friends, how and why this will\
  \ always be home. I thank him for showing me his town, for teaching me the history\
  \ that I had not known."
