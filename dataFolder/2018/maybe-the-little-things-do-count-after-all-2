Text: "I left the hotel and started to walk down the road. My family was close behind.\
  \ The receptionist at the hotel had given the most vague instructions on how to\
  \ get to the small town of Hoi An. After 10 more minutes of walking, I was beginning\
  \ to get exasperated. When were we going to reach this place and how would we even\
  \ know that we had?\n\nThat's probably when I realized; we were already there. The\
  \ roads were much narrower and were laid in stone. The structures around were all\
  \ yellow. It was like the sun had touched every house. More than that, it was like\
  \ something made me completely aware of all the history and culture that was present\
  \ here that I had suddenly become a part of.\n\nI jump as I hear something behind\
  \ me. A stream of bicycles, all ridden by local people carrying passengers in tow\
  \ are making their way along the streets. \"Beep Beep\" they shouted out whilst\
  \ navigating through the busy streets. And my, were the streets busy. There were\
  \ hordes of tourists walking about sprinkled with the local people. There were people\
  \ selling food, shop owners coaxing people to enter their shops and grandmothers\
  \ staring out from their balcony surveying the streets. \n\nMy sister and I bought\
  \ tickets to enter a typical Vietnamese house. Little did we know that the family\
  \ still lived there! I could never imagine allowing strangers into my house as if\
  \ I were on display. I would've probably gone to great lengths to avoid them. And\
  \ perhaps, that is what made the experience so different. The  inhabitants of the\
  \ house were cooking as we went in and the owner of the house was walking around\
  \ like he was just  another tourist.\n\nAs we exited the house, I saw the most smallest\
  \ lady who must have been above ninety carrying  very large, very heavy sack over\
  \ her back. I felt so bad for her, I immediately wanted to help. Before I knew it\
  \ though, she had disappeared through the throng of people.\n\nThe rest of the day\
  \ was spent in just walking around the small city and along the beautiful promenade.\
  \ In most places there is always some specific things to do. Here, it was merely\
  \ being present that was enough. Initially I thought I felt a connection with the\
  \ place, but looking back, it was the people that made the place.\n\nAs the end\
  \ of the day grew nearer, I saw the old lady again. Before I could feel an ounce\
  \ of sadness for her, she catches my eye. She gives me the broadest smile. I couldn't\
  \ help smiling back."
