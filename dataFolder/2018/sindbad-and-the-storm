Text: "Having given up entirely on maintaining privacy, I relinquished the useless\
  \ flowery pink curtain separating the toilet from the rest of the boat, and her\
  \ male crew, in a desperate and pointless bid to remain seated. Sindbad, lurching\
  \ drunkenly, finally succeeded in sending me flailing, bare assed and squatting,\
  \ across the head while an image of Elvis, dead and utterly dethroned, danced helpfully\
  \ through my mind.\n\nIt had been six days since I'd decided to join the crew of\
  \ Sindbad, a hulking steel sail boat bound for Fiji. Five days since raising anchor\
  \ in New Zealand, alongside Captain Doug, a man able to make such liberal use of\
  \ swear words he could string together full sentences using little else. Four days\
  \ since the storm we were going to outrun caught us up rendering Niv, the Israeli\
  \ tank commander, violently ill, green tinge and all. Two days since the galley\
  \ flooded for the first time sending yoghurt pods and celery bunches into six inches\
  \ of salt water containing a thoroughly unruffled squid, and the sticky entrails\
  \ of a honey jar brought on board by Brad, the Kiwi bee keeper. One day since the\
  \ wind generator had been ripped over-board by the now standard 20-foot waves. And\
  \ several hours since we'd discovered a tear in the main sail which was slowly developing\
  \ into a gaping maw of tattered red canvas. \n\nHaving extricated myself from the\
  \ mess in the toilet and gone back up on deck I discovered we were all studiously\
  \ ignoring the ring of cracking paint around the mast, and not mentioning the alarming\
  \ groans now occasionally issuing from its base. Nothing could be done about it\
  \ anyway. At night as the storm reached its climax it hurled down great sheets of\
  \ lightning illuminating the waves in a sudden ghostly green, only to disappear\
  \ in a flood of darkness. White caps battered by the wind transformed into great\
  \ snowy peaks, avalanches of salt throwing us over their crests to unseen valleys\
  \ surrounded by cold hard walls of water. Sindbad all the while wailing to the tune\
  \ of shrieking, twisting metal. The darkness seemed to project out and out and out\
  \ into wild oblivion. \n\nUntil at last, stillness.\n\nOn watch for the last time\
  \ I stepped outside to an infinite cathedral of purple stars, the great milky arm\
  \ of our galaxy draped over Sindbad in the balmy air of the South Pacific. The sky's\
  \ ancient travelers' tales mirrored below in glassy water disturbed only by the\
  \ tiny creatures dancing blue and green in our wake. All is peaceful on the edge\
  \ of a storm."
