Text: "Porto is red.\nRed as the guy offering French kisses and hugs - so does the\
  \ cardboard note at his feet say - between two ruas, not far from the bus stop where\
  \ an old man is selling fish from a bucket of ice.\nRed as the cry of seagulls haunting\
  \ you in the alleyways and up the steps from the river to the castle. \nPorto is\
  \ red, and I got lost in it.\nI was heading for the Duero on my own. \nWhen the\
  \ Eiffel bridge - whose real name is that of a good king, but what did he do compared\
  \ to the Eiffel Tower? - came into view behind the crouched houses, I felt like\
  \ Colombo.\nI don't know how long I stood there.\nIt was cold and the air smelt\
  \ of salt and wine. I put on a sweater and listened to two boys, hardly more than\
  \ children, playing Mozart and Chopin on a rickety keyboard, and for a while I fell\
  \ in love with one of them, the one unheeding of the smartphones filming, who bit\
  \ his nails between stuffs.\nThe sky turned pink, and the wind whistled above the\
  \ nearby ocean. It was time to get back.\nPorto is a roller coaster of lights and\
  \ colors and voices and music; it gets stuck in bottlenecked alleyways, in hidden\
  \ stairs and in endless uphill lanes.\nIt was still daylight, but the street lamps\
  \ were already lit.\nUnder a street light were two kittens and a big black cat.\n\
  I kneeled, snapping my fingers to catch their attention.\nIt was then that I saw\
  \ the old lady.\nShe was in the shade of a door across the street, sitting on a\
  \ purple footstool. She was staring at me, her lips half closed. She was wearing\
  \ a short-sleeved mousy-colored dress with blue rosebuds which hardly contained\
  \ her heavy body.\nI waved to greet her; the big black cat hissed at me.\nThe old\
  \ lady stood up floundering and waving.\nIn the crooked alleyway there was no-one\
  \ else, but the old lady, the cats and me.\nI stepped back against a wall.\nThe\
  \ old lady was pointing at me, mumbling in her Portuguese lingo.\nAs soon as she\
  \ walked down the steps from the door to the street, the big black cat planted itself\
  \ between her legs.\n\"Non capisco!\"\nShe floundered down to pick up the big, black\
  \ cat and immediately dropped it.\nShe clasped her breasts and, while pressing them,\
  \ she said \"m\xE3e, m\xE3e\".\nShe was sinking her fingers into her flesh, looking\
  \ at the cat, shaking her head.\nM\xE3e.\n\nPorto is red.\nRed as the green, orange,\
  \ pink tiles of the houses, to be felt for a short while.\nRed as the old cat lady's\
  \ wrinkled, jellyfish-like breasts to tell me that the big black cat strolling around\
  \ her legs was a mother, and I couldn't pet her."
