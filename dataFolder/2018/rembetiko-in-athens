Text: "He took my suitcase and flung it in the boot of the car. Like many young men\
  \ in the city, he seemed straight out of a fashion magazine. \n\nThe sun was shining\
  \ but the air was damp. I had hanging from my arms bags filled with books and oranges;\
  \ bits of home and sunshine I was taking back to the low skies of a country I had\
  \ decided to make mine. \n\nThe poetry of Athens is one which many times over took\
  \ me by surprise, both everywhere to be found and nowhere to be caught;  floating\
  \ on the smoke of a cigarette, nestled in the cry of a song, nonchalantly wrapped\
  \ around words flavoured by the tiniest cup of coffee sipped over the longest of\
  \ time. Springing from the ground also, chanting around the white and marble ruins.\
  \ Chatting, loving, kissing. \n\nHe spoke a near-perfect English but it felt words\
  \ escaped one another. He was an actor and he played for children, somewhere lost\
  \ in an enchanted garden. He was a musician also and played rembetiko. We drove\
  \ on a road bordered by cypress trees, he said I confounded him, made him lose his\
  \ words.  We entered a tunnel and he apologized. I laughed because my own had escaped.\
  \ Butterflies filled the car.\n\nRembetiko is the song and music of the revolutionary.\
  \ During the dictatorship, rembetiko was banned for it spoke of drugs and sex, lust\
  \ and death. In tavernas, people secretly gathered to indulge.\n\nIn all my life\
  \ I have never heard anything so beautiful as the voice of the languishing greek\
  \ rebetisse floating atop the curls of cigarette smoke and etchings of bouzouki.\
  \ The world slows when she sings and in the soft rasp of her voice I finally understand\
  \ the true meaning of melancholy. A man curved with age orders a song and dances\
  \ in a round, arms slightly lifted over his head and hands turning as if reaching\
  \ through space to caress years and times long gone. The privilege of the dance\
  \ is reserved to he who requests the song. Diners, drinkers and smokers watch on.\n\
  \nWe are nearing the airport and fill the car with lyrics of languishing love and\
  \ sweet heartbreak. We pull into the drop-off lane and we agree I will come back\
  \ and we will sing rembetiko together. He pulls my suitcase out of the booth, there\
  \ is melancholy fluttering amongst the butterflies. The sun is shining and the air\
  \ is warm and I think I should sit a while to savour the afternoon heat. A hug and\
  \ a kiss, a simple goodbye as he drives on and I go my way, bags filled with books\
  \ and oranges slipping from my hands and a noisy suitcase grudgingly dragging behind."
