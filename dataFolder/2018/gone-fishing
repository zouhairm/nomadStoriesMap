Text: "We fling the car doors open.\n\u2018Next year we\u2019ll hit the road at midnight,\u2019\
  \ Mum says. Every year is the same\u2014 Sydneysiders take flight as migratory birds\
  \ do. \nWe make for the lake. We go armed. At the water\u2019s edge, Dad tracks\
  \ a gull with a sun-squinted gaze. It dives, crests the surface, rising upwards\
  \ fast, water dripping off its feathers. Fish.\nWe kick off our thongs and step\
  \ in. The skin of the water is hot, we walk until thigh deep. Our rods clink, weighted\
  \ and ready. We stand apart. One by one we cast out. My line stings the air like\
  \ a wet whip. It lands with a plop. The weight pulls the lure deep. I snap the lock\
  \ on. We stand with rods resting on hips looking out at the uncluttered horizon.\
  \ We rarely get lucky. It's taken me years to appreciate that fishing isn't about\
  \ the fish. We've always stuck to the coast in summer. We used to go up north. The\
  \ sea is slick with fish there. Dad would talk about the fishing for weeks beforehand.\
  \ The rods would be packed last so that they could be pulled out first. At the beach,\
  \ he'd talk to other anglers. Peeking into their buckets before committing to a\
  \ spot on the shoreline. His large hands tying tiny knots around the necks of lures.\
  \ Then he'd feel the wind with a licked finger and check for crosswise currents\
  \ & undertows. My siblings and I wouldn't waste time standing still. We'd tear through\
  \ the sand dunes, racing to the shipwreck to watch the water ruin the hull with\
  \ rust. Two decades on I can appreciate fishing as respite from the frantic sprint\
  \ of city living.Theoretically that is. My thoughts yap like dogs impatient for\
  \ attention. Some thoughts pleasant, even companionable, others are raw remnants\
  \ of rotten moments. I once read that the body is mostly made of water. Perhaps,\
  \ if I stand here long enough, my pulse will eventually match the slow lap of the\
  \ lake. I look out at the expanse of water without expectation, yet my adrenal glands\
  \ continue to patter to the pace of the city. \nMy line twangs. \n\u2018You\u2019\
  ve got a bite!\u2019 Dad's voice carries clear over the lake. \nMy line plucks with\
  \ each tail-flick. \n\u2018Hold it steady love.\u2019\nI tense.\n\u2018Now! Reel\
  \ it up!\u2019 \nI panic, forgetting how to unlatch the reel. After a rough search,\
  \ I flip the lock. The rod bows forward. \n\u2018Steady, steady,\u2019 says Dad.\
  \ \nThe rod is straining against the fight of the fish. \n\u2018Quicker!\u2019 \n\
  I spin the reel. \n\u2018Too quick! Steady on.\u2019 \nI falter. The line falls\
  \ slack and fishless. \nIt's late when we wade in, bucket empty, thoughts untangled\
  \ with tidal tempo."
