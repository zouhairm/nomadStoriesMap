Text: "Tossing dead scorpions to chickens, slicing through a tangle of scrub with\
  \ a machete, and shitting in a dirt hole\u2014this is part of our daily routine\
  \ at the farm near Chinandega, Nicaragua.\n     I belong to a group of idealistic\
  \ sixteen-year-olds from British Columbia, Canada. We had volunteered to build a\
  \ cattle-pen, a project for a nearby orphanage. Every weekend, a rundown bus arrives\
  \ with a couple dozen kids. Most smile shyly and skip around. \n     All except\
  \ Marcos. \n     He came to the orphanage from La Chureca, the largest garbage dump\
  \ in Central America. When they found him, he was suffering from kwashiorkor; his\
  \ belly bloated from malnutrition. Now that he\u2019s healthy, he\u2019s impatient\
  \ to flex and wrestle.\n     On today's visit to the farm, a chaperone tells me\
  \ that Marcos is on his last warning for violent behaviour. One more violent act\
  \ and he could get kicked out of the orphanage. In an effort to distract him from\
  \ fighting, I let him listen to my iPod. \n     \u201CNo me gusta esto \xBFTienes\
  \ buena m\xFAsica?\u201D Marcos asks.\n     \u201C\xBFQuieres m\xFAsica Espa\xF1\
  ola?\u201D I ask.\n     \u201CSi.\u201D \n     He skips through the songs until\
  \ he finds the gangster rap song, Jefe, by Daddy Yankee and asks me to turn it up.\
  \ With the earbuds in, he shouts out the chorus, revealing his anger and pain. Then\
  \ suddenly he hugs me, his anger gone. At that moment, I am transported back to\
  \ La Chureca, wanting nothing more than this boy never to return there. \n ***\n\
  \     Just weeks earlier our introduction to Nicaragua had included a drive past\
  \ La Chureca on our way to the farm. The stench of piss, decay, and the chemical\
  \ odor of shoe glue filled the bus. The vultures stared at a young girl in a clean\
  \ white button-up shirt walking past the emaciated cattle and mangy dogs that wandered\
  \ through the rotting garbage. People who lived here were busy separating the trash\
  \ into piles of plastic, glass, and scrap metals to sell later.\n     We saw one\
  \ shack with a mural of Anastasio Somoza Debayle, the de facto ruler of the country\
  \ from 1967 to 1979,  painted with the teeth of a vampire. We would later learn\
  \ that he bought blood from his people for cheap and sold it to the United States\
  \ and Europe. \n     There we sat, safe, peering out our windows as though La Chureca\
  \ was a tourist attraction. At the time, I didn\u2019t know that my friend would\
  \ end up back here. Should I have left my iPod with Marcos? Could I have taught\
  \ him to channel his anger? These were questions I didn\u2019t know yet to ask."
