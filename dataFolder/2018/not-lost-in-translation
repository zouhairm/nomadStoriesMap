Text: "Little did I know that Milan saves its most intimate and tender experience\
  \ for dessert. \nAt first, everything seems to be a mess. Italy around swirls and\
  \ chirps, people \u2014 or just human-like elegant and expressive birds \u2014 saunter\
  \ through the streets of the European fashionable, pulsating heart. Lazily, I try\
  \ to invent stories for the passers-by, drinking a cup of bitter-as-break-up espresso\
  \ near Piazza del Duomo. However, they are much more vivid than my tired imagination.\n\
  To say \"Love is in the air\" would be too pretentious. Here love just is, it covers\
  \ everything with a thin layer of another lifestyle, previously unbeknownst to me.\
  \ An old Mediterranean guy skypes with his paramour, whispering tender words on\
  \ the edge of obscenity, just in front of the gloomy Gothic cathedral. Schoolkids\
  \ occupy the banks in the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II, a teenager boldly caresses\
  \ his girlfriend, kisses directed to the cleavage. A sassy senior lady \u2014 stylish\
  \ peroxide blonde \u2014 studies thoroughly a shop window full of Durex lubes. Primavera,\
  \ bambino, Milano, a giant romcom scenery. \nIt is 2:00 a.m., I am sitting on a\
  \ bench in front of Milano Centrale, waiting for an airport transfer. The city is\
  \ a restless sleeper \u2014 here and there people walk alone and in groups, slightly\
  \ drunk and cheerful. Suddenly, a young guy approaches me \u2014 clean-shaven, perfectly\
  \ coiffed hair, a white shirt with a few wrinkles, top two buttons undone. He asks\
  \ when the station opens, so I just show four fingers. \nHe nods absentmindedly;\
  \ then sits, lights a cigarette and suddenly starts a passionate, dolorous soliloquy.\
  \ I get only brief passages, enough to understand that it is a sad love story. Out\
  \ of the corner of my eye I see a bunch of roses in a trash bin nearby, doomed by\
  \ the grandeur of Mussolini-commissioned pseudo-Antique train station. \nSomehow,\
  \ I manage to throw my Si, Triste and Niente properly. His nervous fingers and trembling\
  \ voice tell me more than words. We speak in sadness, either from abandoning a beautiful\
  \ city or leaving the love behind. \nI pat him on the shoulder as he confesses his\
  \ infidelities. Finally, he stops and asks me a long, elaborate question that I\
  \ am just not able to grasp. \"Mi scusi, no parlo Italiano,\" I murmur, ashamed.\
  \ He thanks me nevertheless for being understanding, we hug clumsily. He disappears\
  \ into the Milanese night. \nTwo hours later I greet the dawn at Bergamo airport.\
  \ The air hostess asks me something but I seem to have forgotten all the words."
