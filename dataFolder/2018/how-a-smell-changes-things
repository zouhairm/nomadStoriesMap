Text: "Bags packed? Check.\nLicense at hand? Check.\nPetrol in the car? Check.\nNerves\
  \ high? Double, or wait, rather triple check.\nDriving alone? Check.\nThese were\
  \ my emotions as I was about to embark on my first trip down to Springbok in the\
  \ Northern Cape. Alone. No company, whatsoever.\nSeven hours on the N7 from Cape\
  \ Town felt dreadfully long.\nMy life was on the verge of taking a major turn \u2013\
  \ which was moving out on my own. And no, not only moving but starting my career\
  \ somewhere foreign with no family in sight. \nLeaving my mother, whom I\u2019ve\
  \ been raised by as a single parent, was the toughest. Knowing that I cannot simply\
  \ waltz into her room to have a chat or sip on a strong cup of coffee probably broke\
  \ me the most. Our norm would become talks on the cell phone, considering either\
  \ one of us were available of course.\nWe hugged, we cried and then next minute\
  \ I closed the door of my navy blue Polo Vivo, started the car, put the car in drive\
  \ (because it\u2019s automatic), hooted and waved good bye to the one person who\
  \ means everything to me. I was setting off on a journey into the unknown. \nAs\
  \ I looked in my rear view mirror, the image of my mother standing in front of the\
  \ house started becoming more and more faint.\nTwenty minutes later I was on the\
  \ N7, driving off to my new destiny.\nIn that moment, I felt a whirlwind of emotions.\
  \ That of being sad, having fear, yet being excited. However, knowing that I was\
  \ about to start off my nursing career filled my heart with joy and my tummy with\
  \ butterflies.\nAs I kept going further on the N7, the beauty of Table Mountain\
  \ slowly started to fade just as my mother and the house had in my rear view mirror.\n\
  I became accustomed to having sand between my toes, the fresh moist aroma of the\
  \ Atlantic Ocean and the vibrancy of city life. Now I was stepping into a village,\
  \ one which is small and not what I\u2019m used to.\nMinutes became hours, and next\
  \ thing I knew, I had one more hour before I reached my destination. \nThere was\
  \ not much to see along the way, besides fynbos, farms and small villages.\nI arrived\
  \ at the residence that I would share with my new colleagues. It was big and beautiful.\
  \ Everyone was so welcoming. There was an aroma of fresh oven baked bread in the\
  \ air with a slight scent of rooibos tea.\nI then realised that this distinct whiff\
  \ reminded me of my mother\u2019s home. I was calm and smiled. The last thing I\
  \ expected was for all the nerves and anxiety to turn to contentment on the first\
  \ day."
