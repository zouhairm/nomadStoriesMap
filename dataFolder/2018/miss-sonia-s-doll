Text: "Dear you,\nLet me tell you a story!...\u201D Once upon a time\u2026 and they\
  \ lived happily ever after!\u201D\nCould be but\u2026 better than that is to tell\
  \ you about a kind of a fairytale; or not, depends the way you see it \u2013 for\
  \ me it was real, it was unforgettable, a book to read and to lend to imaginary\
  \ friends.\nMy name is Argentina and I come from Portugal. I am a doll \u2013 miss\
  \ S\xF3nia\u2019s doll - and one day I decided to stop to be just a doll and to\
  \ adventure myself in a real world finding who I was. The destiny was myself: Argentina.\
  \ The framework of the word is making a local connection and brings people\u2019\
  s dolls of diverse cultures together for the same cause: light, childhood, happiness.\
  \ \nA doll is defined by much more things than its work but through its activities,\
  \ its imaginary, we can picture this time of her in Argentina, her findings, her\
  \ personal mark.\n\nBefore, I worked in a Sonia\xB4s house, mind and life \u2013\
  \ in Madeira Island, Portugal. My contribute to the social and educational development\
  \ of little girls through fictional and illusory moments are fantastic and unforgettable\
  \ treasures. I was responsible for one of the girls: S\xF3nia.\n\nCurious about\
  \ the Argentinian doll\u2019s culture activities, Argentina learnt every day, participating\
  \ actively \u2013 swapping information with other dolls, interesting for what is\
  \ going on in the other houses and other\u2019s girls mind and playroom, sharing\
  \ material, sharing ideas, reading the newspaper daily, learning how to cook Argentinian\
  \ menus with the school dolls chefs, traveling around investigating time, etc. Learning\
  \ by Doing was part of my motto, being not afraid of trying new methods and strategies.\
  \ I was an astonishing doll!\nIt depends only on you being or not a good Doll. It\
  \ is not easy, sometimes you feel alone, feeling no one cares and maybe not but\
  \ the important are the doll\u2019s owners and they care.\n\nMy personal advices\
  \ for future volunteer\u2019s dolls:\nListen and understand each name origin. Here:\
  \ Argentinian needs, likes, dislikes, weaknesses and abilities, work with them and\
  \ with the rest of the volunteers as much as you can. Create simple and useful things.\
  \ Think: it is not about you but about them. Research about playtimes, education\
  \ (or other field you like and feel comfortable with). Visit the other projects,\
  \ see what kind of work they are doing, research and be critical, compare and develop\
  \ yourself, learn the local cultural, participate, live! Making a local connection.\
  \ \n\u201COnce upon a time\u2026\u201D Now it is your turn to continue!"
