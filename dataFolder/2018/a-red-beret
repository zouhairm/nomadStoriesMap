Text: "What is it like, walking down a deserted country road in rural France, through\
  \ a sea of corn, a rainstorm beating down on you, and with the nearest person who\
  \ will worry about you a whole ocean and language away? TERRIFYING. But in the fight\
  \ or flight mindset that had overtaken me, I could see only one option and that\
  \ was to go forward. Into the storm. Down an unknown path. With only what lay within\
  \ in me to see me through.\n        After about 15 minutes of walking, the storm\
  \ began to lessen, and I was able to peek out from under my umbrella and start to\
  \ take stock. Still no cars, or landmarks that I could quite recognize, but there,\
  \ far down the road\u2026a person! I wavered between gratitude, that I was no longer\
  \ alone, and worry, that this person could be a threat. But as we neared one another,\
  \ what I made out was a portly, middle-aged, gentleman carrying an umbrella and\
  \ also looking a bit anxious, for having walked through the same downpour as I had.\
  \ He was wearing a red beret. When we finally got to the point in our trajectories\
  \ where we needed to either avoid eye contact or exercise some courtesy, our eyes\
  \ met, we curtly nodded to the other, and I felt a gruff \u201CBonjour\u201D slip\
  \ from my lips, answered by his own. And then, on we both went.\n Five minutes later,\
  \ the sun burst through the clouds and I laughed. At the red beret. At our dignified\
  \ greetings, so incongruent with the lashing nature had just delivered. At fear,\
  \ and at the state of my humanity. The cornfields around me were dazzling my eyes\
  \ with a thousand droplets left behind. The sky had turned the brilliant blue that\
  \ comes after a storm and up above me, birds were wheeling through the sky, freed\
  \ once more to fly. Which was about the time my own heart lifted and I was overcome\
  \ with so much\u2026\u201Dmuch-ness\u201D! And I thought: How lucky, I am! To be\
  \ in this place, to have walked this road, and had this stunning moment, so beyond\
  \ the normal experience of your everyday traveler. How fortunate am I?! To have\
  \ kept a promise, made to a version of myself that could never fathom going anywhere.\
  \ And yet look\u2026do you see? How far that girl has come! How many \u201Cimpossible\
  \ things\u201D and \u201Cnever wills\u201D she has somehow found the courage to\
  \ make real! \n If you have traveled before, then perhaps you already know what\
  \ wild experiences of body and mind can occur along the way. If you have not\u2026\
  don\u2019t give up hope. Get ready. Pack an umbrella."
