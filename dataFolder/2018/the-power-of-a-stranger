Text: "The last thing I expected when visiting Cuba was to have my palms read on a\
  \ stormy night in the middle of a deserted and grim speakeasy. The idea of it all\
  \ sounds like a 1980\u2019s horror film that ends with the sketchy fortune teller\
  \ proclaiming doom on their fearful subject, and out of nowhere anvil falls out\
  \ of the sky and crushes the poor man. After three long hours of an utterly uncomfortable\
  \ bus ride from Havana to Varadero, we arrived hungry and irritable. Unbeknownst\
  \ to any of my fellow travelers, winters in Cuba were hot and rainy. However, we\
  \ were far too famished to be concerned the rain. About a mile down the road we\
  \ found a dimly lit Cuban Cuisine. A strange looking Morrocan woman appeared at\
  \ the end of the bar. To this day my friends and I deny seeing her there before\
  \ she greeted us.Her name was Gem, she was from New Jersey and had traveled to Cuba\
  \ alone. She was a medium and tarot card reader. She then extended the offer to\
  \ perform a complementary reading for us. I began to question the validity of this\
  \ so-called \u201Cgift\u201D Gem claimed to have, however after losing my father\
  \ at the age of 17, I'd be lying if I said the idea of a medium never crossed my\
  \ mind. I accepted the offer. The first card she pulled was a heart with a dagger\
  \ through it. I instantly began to freak out and thought I would soon be the girl\
  \ that gets crushed by an anvil. She asked me if I had been in a recent breakup.\
  \ I reluctantly confirmed. She says during my heartbreak, there was a profound attempt\
  \ on my part to repair the relationship with some powerful force of energy I possessed.\
  \ A chill ran through my body. The next card displayed an uneven scale.Gem explained\
  \ that fairy tales don\u2019t have to end the way they do in the movies and I should\
  \ seriously consider having a baby. The next card she selected had a queen was a\
  \ queen. I explained to her that I had left my corporate job in hopes of pursuing\
  \ my passions as a travel writer. Gem told me that I would be in a partnership with\
  \ two other women that would potentially amass a lot of money.\u201CPowerful projects\
  \ with emotional rewards\u201D she affirmed confidently. I was overjoyed.  I was\
  \ currently in a partnership with two other women in hopes of becoming an all-women\
  \ production team. I was floored by the accuracy of her reading. It was a compilation\
  \ of affirmations and criticism.  Her readings in regards to my future were all\
  \ things I would wholeheartedly agree with. This was the last thing that I expected\
  \ to happen at the start of 2018."
