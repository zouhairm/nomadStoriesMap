Text: "Tech consultants come in many flavours. Some wear suits, pushing the bottom\
  \ line up for Fortune 500 companies, killing themselves till they make it as Partner\
  \ at a prestigious sounding firm. Others wear spectacles held together by cello\
  \ tape, creating infrastructure  for Tibetan refugee communities, going for daily\
  \ hikes in the woods.\n I was lost in those woods, looking for the brook that flowed\
  \ through them. I\u2019d been walking around in circles for what seemed like years\
  \ of pinecone filtered daylight. It had to be close. I could hear it. I could even\
  \ smell it in the air. What a tease.\nThat\u2019s when I ran into a skinny, middle\
  \ aged man with a walking stick and broken spectacles. I asked him for directions,\
  \ and he offered to escort me. The elusive brook had happened to fall on his route\
  \ for the day.\nBefore taking on the responsibility of my guide in the woods (years\
  \ before it, actually), Wong had moved from Silicon Valley to the laid back town\
  \ of McLeod Ganj to come chill with the Dalai Lama. Punctuated by the sound of his\
  \ walking stick, I learnt that he volunteered to manage the database of the Tibetan\
  \ government in exile. In his spare time, he created an intranet to connect the\
  \ schools in the community with learning resources, as you do.\nWe stopped at a\
  \ tiny cottage emanating the scent of hot Aloo Paranthas.  A kind eyed woman, whose\
  \ face was wisened with wrinkles brought them out of the straw kitchen and served\
  \ them with curd and butter. My tummy and my sore legs were both thankful.\nAs I\
  \ sat there, downing one Parantha after next, I felt like an audience to an unreal\
  \ world, listening to Wong's stories of espionage attempts by the Chinese and threats\
  \ to his life. Didn't he know these concerns were limited to works of fiction? Real\
  \ life had real concerns. Like falling quarterly profits.\nWe thanked the lady and\
  \ walked on, until one final turn revealed the brook. The world around me slowed\
  \ down. My sore muscles suddenly stopped complaining. I could smell magic. What\
  \ a town this was. I was changing flavours.\n\nThat night I found myself singing\
  \ and dancing with a group of young Israeli backpackers. There I met a lady (formerly\
  \ a sniper) who was kind enough to translate for me as the rest of the group, in\
  \ a wild chatter of Hebrew critically analysed the Torah or maybe Netanyahu. Or\
  \ was it the crappy Israeli food in India? I forget. She had deep blue eyes, holding\
  \ so many mysteries within them. But that's a story for another day."
