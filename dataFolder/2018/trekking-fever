Text: "The day started with trekking through the hilly village paths and green rice\
  \ fields. It was close to harvest time. We passed by a couple of buffaloes chewing\
  \ their healthy diet and spoiled by their caretakers. Owning buffalo in Torajan\
  \ culture is a pride. The buffaloes, along with pigs, will be sacrificed at the\
  \ traditional burial ceremony as they are believed to accompany the spirit goes\
  \ to heaven.\n\nAfter three hours of walk, we arrived at Batutumonga, located on\
  \ the slope of Mount Sesean in the Tana Toraja regency of the South Sulawesi province,\
  \ Indonesia. We had our lunch on the porch of one of the houses. The villagers were\
  \ busy building temporary stage-halls and chambers nearby. A display that a traditional\
  \ burial ceremony would soon be held.\n\nNext, we climbed the mountain. It might\
  \ be easy for frequent climbers, but unfortunately not for me. It was either my\
  \ backpack was too heavy or my aging self could not keep up with my younger travel\
  \ friend and our savvy guide. It took a little more than an hour to get to the lower\
  \ peak. We were not planning to go further to the highest peak at 2100 meters above\
  \ the sea level. The view was breathtaking. Afar, we could see Rantepao city, the\
  \ capital of North Toraja regency, surrounded by green forests, fields, and mountain\
  \ range.\n\nTrekking down the mountain for another hour, we reached a different\
  \ village. We stopped by the Loko Mata stone grave site. The large stone hill had\
  \ been carved in hollow squares, to function as the caves to place the coffins.\
  \ \u201CThe ones without door mean there is no coffin yet inside,\u201D our guide\
  \ explained.\n\nOur final destination was to stay overnight at a guest house in\
  \ Landorundun village, 45 minutes of walk from Loko Mata. The accommodation was\
  \ owned by the village chief. The stage-house structure looked similar as a tongkonan\
  \ \u2014 a traditional Torajans ancestral home with boat-curved giant roof. The\
  \ chief had seven tongkonans built in front of the guest house, reflecting his status\
  \ as the community leader.\n\nExhausted and sticky after more than 21 kilometers\
  \ of trekking, I had to clean up before the host family called for dinner. Being\
  \ near the mountain, the air and the water were cool and fresh. But, oh, my, I did\
  \ not expect the water to be freezing cold. As it was in a remote village, one could\
  \ not wish to have hot water supply for the bathroom. I braved myself to take a\
  \ quick bath.\n\nThen I felt warm.\n\nDuring dinner, my body was getting warmer\
  \ and my throat was sore.\n\nI had a fever."
