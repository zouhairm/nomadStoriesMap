Text: "Chai is a ritual in Kerala, and that time of the day has come. We leave our\
  \ rented scooter on the side of the country road flanked by palm trees, and my friend\
  \ heads without hesitation towards a tin-roofed, red brick house. No sign, no light\
  \ coming from the inside, I am still wondering how it can be a caf\xE9 of any kind,\
  \ but my friend is already in and I can only follow him. My eyes still struggling\
  \ to find their way into the darkness, a middle-aged man welcomes us in Malayalam\
  \ and invites us to take a seat on the wooden benches. I have only been in India\
  \ for a few days, though, and chai and its spice mix are still a mystery to me.\
  \ So, curiosity pushes me into the kitchen, where metal pots sit on the only artificial\
  \ lights in the building. As soon as we are served our drink, a short, plump woman\
  \ comes out of nowhere in a bright blue saree, which reveals a generous strip of\
  \ her belly. A golden tilaka on her forehead, she looks at me - at my foreign-looking\
  \ clothing and short hair - and starts asking questions with eagerness. Unable to\
  \ understand, I let my friend answer for me - she\u2019s from Italy, she\u2019s\
  \ come to Kerala for a wedding, it\u2019s her first time in India. Suddenly overflowing\
  \ with joy, the woman clings on to my neck: I am the first foreigner to ever visit\
  \ her place and she just can\u2019t let go of me. I smile, embarrassed: I can\u2019\
  t fathom the woman\u2019s motives for being so happy about meeting a stranger. I\
  \ finally let myself be captivated by her joy, trying to make it mine. She most\
  \ likely will never see them, but asks insistently for pictures of our unexpected\
  \ hug, and boasts her best smile when I ask her to pose in front of the house.\n\
  \nIt\u2019s this last picture that encapsulates the Kerala I\u2019ve seen, the Kerala\
  \ that I\u2019ve met: every corner of this country - every house and every shop,\
  \ every tuk-tuk and every truck - hosts a vivid image of Jesus, declares someone\u2019\
  s infinite love for Allah, or enchants your gaze with Shiva and his multiple arms.\
  \ Every Malayali lives side by side with a neighbor who has a different skin tone,\
  \ believes in a different god and possibly speaks a different language. Communication\
  \ doesn\u2019t always come through, but gentle head shakes and broad smiles simply\
  \ take the place of words.\n\nChai time is over, and we must leave, back on the\
  \ road. One thing doesn\u2019t leave me, though: the image of a plump Malayali woman\
  \ and of her gratuitous smile."
