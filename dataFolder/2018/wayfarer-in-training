Text: "London, August 2017\n\nI was tired. Tired of the merry-go-round of zero-hour\
  \ contract jobs, tired of not having anything to fill my days other than mindless\
  \ social media surfing, tired of feeling like I was wasting my life.\n\nI was two\
  \ years out of university yet the job promised post-graduation seemed to be nothing\
  \ but an illusion. After a year and a half of unpaid internships and countless rejections,\
  \ I took a break from the job hunt. This was my time to rebuild my self-esteem and\
  \ to put myself first, rather than be swayed by family pressure.\n\nI was seeking\
  \ something new yet wasn't sure how to begin. How to make the leap, for fear of\
  \ falling and bruising my legs, crying out in pain.\n\nI always knew I wanted to\
  \ go somewhere - the question was where.\n\nA trip to Ireland was fast approaching,\
  \ maybe I could go from there? Or perhaps Spain in November? \nA few suggestions\
  \ lingered in my mind but none of them seemed good enough. I was looking for something\
  \ epic, something that would push me out of my comfort zone.\n\nSomething extraordinary.\n\
  \n\nLondon, October 2017\n\nAfter two months of going back and forth over my travel\
  \ plans, I was no closer to figuring out where to begin my never-ending journey.\
  \ \n\nBut locking eyes on a one-way trip from London to Auckland  was a good place\
  \ to start. The journey would take me through LA, Lima to Buenos Aires before the\
  \ ultimate destination of Auckland. The \xA3979 price tag wouldn't hurt my savings\
  \ too much I figured.\n\nOn the spur of the moment I rang my travel agent, expressing\
  \ interest in the Hollywood to Hobbiton route. He alerted me of the prices for flying\
  \ at different times. If I was going in the next month, he suggested that I pay\
  \ soon otherwise the prices will increase even more.\n\nI can't let that happen,\
  \ I thought. This was my chance. Now or never.\n\nWith that in mind, I booked the\
  \ trip. \n\nOnce the confirmation email reached my inbox,  I began making plans\
  \ to prepare for my journey, create more savings and break the news to my loved\
  \ ones that I was embarking on a trip of a lifetime.\n\nA trip with a beginning\
  \ but no clear end. \n\n\nHeathrow Airport, November 2017\n\nI'm about to board\
  \ the plane to LA, having barely crammed 23 years of existence into a suitcase and\
  \ a backpack loaned to me by an aunt.\n\nThe last week has been filled with appointments\
  \ and arguments but also support and love. It helped me feel secure in my decision\
  \ to explore the world. I am ready.\n\nI board the plane with the world at my feet\
  \ and a passport in my hand."
