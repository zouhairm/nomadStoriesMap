Text: "Slowly the full moon rose across the horizon.In front of me, the majestic Mount\
  \ Nilkanth was shining The reflection of the moon  was shimmering in the lake.It\
  \ was heaven.I came to senses when I saw the  huge landslide in front of me.A massive\
  \ debris of mud & rocks lay ahead .I started walking from Badrinath at dawn after\
  \ waiting for a week for the weather to improve.The Kedarnath tragedy had diverted\
  \ the resources . Badrinath was cut off from civilisation.The solitary phone booth\
  \ remained packed with anxious people.The ATMs ran out of money.The restaurants\
  \ closed down.Old and sick people were suffering .Food and water became scarcer\
  \ day by day.Yet it was memorable. Drum rolls, murmured chants and a cacophony of\
  \ bells mingled with the roar of the Alakananda river,made the whole atmosphere\
  \ ethereal.I carefully crossed the debris to find that the main highway has merged\
  \ with the river.The decision of staying back after the trip proved to be lethal.To\
  \ my dismay,the army team with supplies was yet to arrive.The last biscuit & little\
  \ water was left.A series of growls woke me up.Five sets of glowing eyes were looking\
  \ at me.I rummaged through my sack and found the  lighter.After several attempts,I\
  \ managed to  lit up and find some  juniper branches lying nearby.The fire kept\
  \ them out.Hunger and tiredness  had weared me out.I somehow managed to be awake.Everytime,I\
  \  was fell asleep I woke up to find them coming near me.I hurled burning branches\
  \ at them.The green eyes moved out but again came back.The night became darker .I\
  \ just kept on praying.The face of my mother seemed to appear in front of me.\u201C\
  Hey Man, wake up... What are you doing here?\u201DI could barely open my eyes.Hazily,I\
  \ could recognise four Army men.  I came to sense in Joshimath in the Army tent.I\
  \ later came to know that I had strayed into the nearby jungle and was spotted by\
  \ the Army team who were passing through this area. The decision to not listen to\
  \ the weather warnings did push me to the edge.."
