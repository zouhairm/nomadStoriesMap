Text: "Have you ever been to a wedding? Watched the happy couple seal their future\
  \ with a kiss? Danced with other guests until the dawn? Well, I hadn\u2019t. Whenever\
  \ I heard that any of my friends is invited to a marriage ceremony, I was nagging\
  \ them, until they promised to take me as their plus one. I had dreamt of a wedding\
  \ reception, just like the one from the movies. But when, after 19 years of unsuccessful\
  \ attempts, I was given an opportunity, it wasn\u2019t like the movies at all. It\
  \ was nevertheless one of the most peculiar and exotic experiences of my life. \n\
  \ After graduating high school, my friend Lea and I decided to be unconventional.\
  \ We packed our backpacks and set off to the Silk Road. Thanks to a network of relations,\
  \ we were able to make a road trip through the deserts of Uzbekistan. We weren\u2019\
  t planning it, but as one thing led to another we suddenly ended up in Dushanbe,\
  \ Tajikistan, with nothing else than passports and bottle of water with us. Funny,\
  \ how the most memorable things happen unexpectedly. In the morning we were just\
  \ strolling the streets, watching the mosques from the distance, as we were too\
  \  scantily dressed to go inside. In the evening, we ended up at the wedding of\
  \ local celebrity\u2019s son. \n The party was huge. There were hundreds of guests,\
  \ tables groaned with fruits and meats, an orchestra and a Persian group of belly\
  \ dancers. Dressed for a beach party, rather than traditional Pamir wedding, we\
  \ were trying to stay on the outside. Our attempts were undermined by the local\
  \ TV crew, who found the guests from Europe most eminent at the party and broadcasted\
  \ a live material about Poland loving Tajikistan and us being special envoys to\
  \ develop ever closer relations between our countries. \n On Tajik wedding, women\
  \ and men celebrate separately. The table sitting is divided by sex and so are the\
  \ circles you dance in. After being filmed by the TV, we were approached by the\
  \ women and asked to dance in their circle, but as we were returning to our table,\
  \ we were sucked up to the circle of men intrigued by our sundresses. Lea, who was\
  \ born a party animal started to dance with them and soon I was dancing too. Just\
  \ imagine the astonishment of the feminine circle and the revelation of the elders.\
  \ It took us 3 minutes to realize our faux pas and another 3 to back away to the\
  \ table to collect our bags. However, when we were leaving, we saw the women timidly\
  \ joining men\u2019s circle. Apparently we rearranged some traditions there. Well,\
  \ that was unexpected."
