  \nI chuckle.\n\nStaring back at me from the peeling sign plastered across the wall\
  \ now saturated with condensation was a rather amusing request to keep the door\
  \ of the downstairs bathroom closed. Either that, or it was an abstract appeal to\
  \ all male tourists to close the doors in Chile\u2019s southern lake district with\
  \ care. One way or another, google translate certainly has some explaining to do.\n\
  \nBlindly searching for my belongings l balanced rather precariously upon the sink\
  \ in an effort to keep them away from the puddle of water rapidly creeping its way\
  \ further across the floor, I slip my feet into my sodden flip flops and tiptoe\
  \ toward the door \u2013 the door that, rest assured, is bolted shut. Clothed in\
  \ nothing but a threadbare mustard bath towel that I fought nail and tooth to protect\
  \ from a thieving seaside snatcher just one week prior, I briskly make my way through\
  \ the kitchen towards our room for the next three nights \u2013 a room whose slanting\
  \ floor not only has the capacity to induce anyone with the feeling of inebriation,\
  \ but was sure to make my regular stumble to the toilet in the middle of the night\
  \ quite audacious. Sure enough, as I make my way past the hall, my three travel\
  \ companions are still crouched in ascending order upon the hallway stairs. With\
  \ frowns of perseverance fixed on their foreheads, I assume they are still trying\
  \ to connect to the one bar of wavering WiFi my dated Nokia Lumia refuses to even\
  \ acknowledge.\n\nThe following day I rise, having woken to the sound of a pneumatic\
  \ drill that not even my trusted ear plugs could safeguard me from. Deliriously\
  \ brushing aside the mass of little black creatures that had accumulated during\
  \ the night on the window still and head of my bed, I stumble to the door. However,\
  \ upon reaching the bathroom I am stopped in my tracks. I stand gaping at three\
  \ muscular men systematically removing every unit and floorboard of what, just one\
  \ day prior, had been our kitchen. My still sluggish and utterly bewildered companions\
  \ eventually trudge into the doorway beside me. The men, amused by the sights of\
  \ four speechless gringas standing dumbfound in their pyjamas, assure us to continue\
  \ with the preparation of the Quaker Oates I am clutching at my side. However, It\
  \ is only then that I hear the faint noise coming from next door.\n\n\"\xBFHay alguien\
  \ all\xED? \xBFHija?\u201D \n\nNo it isn\u2019t a noise. It is Patricia\u2019s mother.\
  \ She is locked in the bathroom."
