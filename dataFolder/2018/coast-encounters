Text: "Within the hug of Cornwall, and beyond the town of Newquay, my family and I\
  \ resided in the small nook of Mousehole, a pocket-sized village with a handful\
  \ of cottages whose pastel facades are etched along the bay lining the old fishing\
  \ port.\n\nEnding the week\u2019s trip of blustery explorations and shivering walks,\
  \ we hastily pack up moments before leaving on our last day. A canoe that had sat\
  \ within our tiny old one-room living space, where crouching proved compulsory to\
  \ prevent a knocked head upon the ceiling, had become an object of curious importance\
  \ considering such a small space, and ultimately a temptation too pertinent to avoid.\n\
  \nWithin seconds of the resolution, my family and I marched out, carrying the oblong\
  \ object down hobbled steps towards the cove. Persisting into icy waters, I clamber\
  \ in and venture outwards, beyond the fortress walls of the bay, upon which the\
  \ many visitors and families stood under the chilly English sun watching out across\
  \ the seascape I had wandered into.\n\nGliding powerfully, I soar further and for\
  \ a mere triumphant moment sit in the wavy stillness, acknowledging the beast of\
  \ sea before me, before spinning to return back. Amid the majestic feeling of satisfaction,\
  \ the air feeling a little warmer now, the icy seas seeming a little less harsh,\
  \ I am suddenly jolted by an enormous grey creature slinking heavily out of the\
  \ blue, with eyes of big black moons looking to disrupt my peace.\n\nThe content\
  \ moment abruptly swarms inexpiably to a point of fear and sudden self-awareness.\
  \ The brave distance I had ascended now seemed a foolish expanse between me and\
  \ safety. Recollections spurred to my mind of hearing stories upon arrival in Mousehole\
  \ whereby that very same week a shark had been spotted in a town not two minutes\
  \ from this \u2018sweet little cove\u2019. I flounder and yelp for assistance but\
  \ am too far to be heard; families on the wall instead waving and smiling back at\
  \ me in the distance. The calamity of the wind and waves drowns out my fears, and\
  \ upon realising I am entirely helpless but for my own efforts, I begin to laugh.\
  \ All I can do now is wade to safety and hope not to be devoured.\n\nI make it back\
  \ unscathed, heart pounding, smiling in a fix of insanity, and am greeted by a young\
  \ boy who calls after me to \u201CGo back out and get the seal!\u201D"
