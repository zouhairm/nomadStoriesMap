Text: "Changing career gears hadn't crossed my mind as I left on the first vacation\
  \ of my life. I had worked in our Wisconsin based family automotive care and sales\
  \ business since I was 9 years old, at first pumping gas anytime I wasn't in school.\
  \ As the years progressed I never took a vacation as the obligations to various\
  \ businesses and customers never allowed me to take time off.  As I approached 60\
  \ years old my understanding wife informed me either I had better take some time\
  \ off or I might be looking for a new life partner! \nI was actually scared to take\
  \ time off and close my business for an extended period of time. But my wife's desire\
  \ to spend time with me away from the daily rigors of business finally won over\
  \ my fears, partially.\nShe planned to whole trip and only asked that I get our\
  \ equipment ready and do all the driving. Colorado, New Mexico, Texas and Alabama\
  \ were all on her list of places to visit.  The first part of the trip I was somewhat\
  \ lost as I had always had a purpose to each day. Besides driving to our next destination\
  \ there was little to do. \nBut somewhere along the trip I wondered if there was\
  \ more to my life than the type of work I had done everyday for 42 years.\nI realized\
  \ while exploring the different locations my wife had chosen that there was another\
  \ world out there of interesting people and places to discover.\nKnowing the feeling\
  \ of discovery and excitement for the first time since I was a child sparked a desire\
  \ inside me I never knew existed. That newfound desire was to bring my feelings\
  \ of exploration to others through writing. The beauty of a early morning sunrise\
  \ over the Colorado plains, the expansive views of New Mexico while on a train trip\
  \ between Albuquerque and Santa Fe, walking the windy beaches of Texas were all\
  \ unexpected treasures. But what really ignited my imagination was the wonderfully\
  \ discursive people I discovered along the way. \nGetting outside my lifelong comfort\
  \ zone was difficult at first but all the wonderful people I met along the way,\
  \ of all ages, made me realize how connected we all are. And it made me realize\
  \ that there is space in this ever complicated world for others to bring the stories\
  \ of wonderful people and places to those who may still be unable to change gears\
  \ and experience the wonderful world around them. After all Grandfather always told\
  \ me \"life comes down to good people, good food and good conversation\". I'm eager\
  \ to change gears and start a new journey in life."
