Text: "2017 was a year full of trips, discovering as much places as I could in Europe\
  \ ( Poland, Georgia, Romania, The Netherlands, Belgium, Bulgaria...) each of them\
  \ bring something new to me. But as I was working in a Travel Blog writing deals\
  \ one day I found a deal to Bali. Who will not want to travel there? The island\
  \ of the Gods. I was totally in! I am spontaneous so I did not doubt it and just\
  \ book it.\n\nI went to this trip with my sister, she is my travel mate. So we arrived\
  \ to Bali and just went out of the plane and I could feel that this pure air and\
  \ this people was totally different that we are. Balinese people are so nice and\
  \ they will give you all that they have. \n\nI wanted to discover a place different\
  \ to were I have been before and if you go to Bali, you will fall in love with this\
  \ place. Their food, their way of life and they welcoming character is so lovely.\n\
  \nYou like nature? Waterfalls, beaches to practice sports and the best sunsets that\
  \ I have seen in all my life. In this island there are more than 10.000 temples,\
  \ I recommend you rent a motorbike and start exploring. Pura Besakih is the mother\
  \ temple but Tanah Lot made me fall in love. Is just awesome! Do you like the animals?\
  \ Then go to monkey forest, the monkeys are waiting for you to give them some bananas\
  \ but be careful. \n\nIf you are there for a long period of time. I totally recommend\
  \ to visit Gili Islands, is a paradise not so far by boat from Bali.\n\nI LOVE BALI.\
  \ You too?"
