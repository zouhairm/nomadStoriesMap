Text: "The imposing peaks that occupy the coastline of Taormina were beginning to\
  \ submit to the misty purple-blue twilight as my tour bus lurched into the bus depot\
  \ after my first solo adventure since arriving in Sicily. I noisily chewed a hang\
  \ nail, glancing between the row of fellow travelers beginning to file out the exit,\
  \ and my dwindling phone battery as it dimly clung to life in my other sweaty palm.\
  \ I gathered my belongings, scampering off the bus I watched as the sun sank into\
  \ the Mediterranean, immersing Taormina into night.\n\nMy phone was dead. I had\
  \ no ride arranged. I imagined contacting my host family to let them know I was\
  \ safety homeward bound to their cozy flat in Catania, about forty-five minutes\
  \ away. Instead I anxiously circled a bus stop, seeing the amount of passengers\
  \ beginning to thin. The incoming coaches were swapping their blinking city stop\
  \ tickers with ominous red 'Fuori Servizio', 'Out of Service' signs. I began to\
  \ mentally kick myself for not bringing my handy Italian phrase book, or investing\
  \ in a portable charger. \n\nMy spotty Italian came through enough to read a small\
  \ yellow sign with white letters reading, 'Trolley to city center every 20 minutes\
  \ until 10'. A slender lane was designated beside the iron post where I joined a\
  \ stooped older couple with wisps of blue-gray and black hair swirling around their\
  \ ears and brows. Once more I was consumed with the delicate cap of night that had\
  \ set on the coast line. \n\nA cherry red trolley with tan copper trim swerved around\
  \ a bend and into the lot, sliding into the lane to come to a stop before us. I\
  \ climbed onto the bus, grabbed a hold of a leathery rung dangling near the door\
  \ which shut behind me with a whoosh. As we careened around a corner the smokey\
  \ spout of Mt. Etna became visible and I felt a gentle tap on my left hip. I turned\
  \ around to greet the tanned faces of the couple. They cooed in slow Italian and\
  \ asked where I was going. I mumbled an explanation, mentioning Catania. The brief\
  \ ride ended and the woman gently guided me by the elbow to the street, where she\
  \ indicated I should wait. The couple disappeared into a shop and returned instantly,\
  \ handing me a shiny ticket stub. Again in the charming steady Italian the man said,\
  \ 'The bus will arrive in 10 minutes, ride it to the Catania Station. Traveling\
  \ is like fishing, a torn net casted right can still catch fish.\" The couple left\
  \ me their telephone and emails and ended up guiding me on more occasions during\
  \ my stay in Sicily."
