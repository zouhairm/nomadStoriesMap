Text: "Ana has investigative eyes that can pick up on those buried thoughts and feelings:\
  \ the ones you don\u2019t know you have, or at least think you\u2019ve gotten rid\
  \ of. They\u2019re speckled green by the way-- her eyes. \n\nI met Ana in a Costa\
  \ Rican bar. It was quiet, like the rest of Potrero, a dusty town with a population\
  \ of about 300. She asked me if I\u2019d heard the news. Another body had been left\
  \ out on the green. \u201CThe men are punching us to death,\u201D she said. I\u2019\
  d heard. I was in Potrero to research domestic violence for an NGO. After a beat\
  \ of silence, Ana continued, \u201CLet\u2019s go out. We both need this.\u201D Her\
  \ accent drifted into the sunset. Everything was pink.\n\nWe hitchhiked to a tourist\
  \ town and bought a bottle Guaro, Costa Rican liquor. We drank it on the street.\
  \ My adrenaline surged. In Potrero, women don't go out at night. \"This town is\
  \ different,\" Ana said.\n\nTwo Dutch ladies with matching tramp stamps drove by\
  \ on a golf cart. They told us to \u201Chop in\u201D and brought us to the beach,\
  \ where a middle-aged man waited, setting palm tree leaves on fire. My stomach was\
  \ warm from the Guaro. The embers from the fire floated to the sky and became stars.\
  \ Even the trees were dancing. More travelers arrived. \u201CLet\u2019s go skinn-n-n-y\
  \ dipping,\u201D one shouted. I tried not to watch Ana peel off her shirt. I felt\
  \ sticky from the heat.\n\nAna said my white butt was glowing, spanked me, then\
  \ giggled, \u201CLet\u2019s go!\u201D She grabbed my hand and we ran into the ocean.\
  \ There was a special type of phytoplankton that turned bright blue when agitated\
  \ by exterior movement, so lines of light followed us. When the waves broke, a frenzy\
  \ of blue dots clung to the shore. \u201CWe\u2019re standing in the sky,\u201D Ana\
  \ said, running her hand down my arm. I felt like the bioluminescent water: where\
  \ she touched I burned, lit up. She kissed me carefully at first, stole my breath.\
  \ Then wrapped herself around me. My whole body was throbbing for her.\n\nMusic\
  \ trickled over from the beach. Ana didn\u2019t want to miss out. Back on the shore,\
  \ we slipped into our clothes and dried by the fire. The travelers spoke of leaving.\
  \ They were scared. \u201CWhat will it feel like to go home with these new things\
  \ inside of us? Will anybody notice?\u201D \n\nAna pulled me back in with those\
  \ eyes, speckled green. My heart was a jungle drum, her kisses a meteor shower.\
  \ And we were still falling when Ana said, \"Having fun can be an act of rebellion,\
  \ you know?\" I nodded. We paused for breath, forehead to forehead. Then, used our\
  \ laughter to lift the sun from behind the hills."
