Text: "December. End of 2017. 22. Quit my job and started my Masters Degree. Free\
  \ week between the end of classes and holidays. My best friend is in RIo making\
  \ the Erasmus programme and it is my opportunity to make my first trip outside Europe.\
  \ What to do?\nOn one hand, I had to spend at least 800\u20AC and going to one of\
  \ the dangerous cities in the world (according to several websites and travel guides!);\
  \ on the other hand, breathtaking beaches, amazing landscapes, samba, caipirinha\
  \ and coconut water! That were a youtube video about Rio and a skype call that pushed\
  \ me to the edge! I have to admitt that I was a bit affraid of what I have heard\
  \ before... Crimes, pickpockets and a very poor society. But it all came down when\
  \ I was landing and seeing that amazing mixture of green, yellow and blue.\nMy ideal\
  \ plan was to keep out of crowded toruist areas - I wanted to know the real beauties\
  \ of RIo. Of course that it is mandatory to go to dive into Ipanema beach and  make\
  \ stand up paddle in Copacabana beach, to visit Sugar Loaf and Christ the Redeemer\
  \ - but I wanted something more!\nIn a week, I have made 5 trails and hicks through\
  \ the interior of Rio. Pedra Bonita was the first one and I can\xB4t have asked\
  \ for something more - a 360\xAA view, across Praia da Barra, Ipanema and Copacabana.\
  \ I have never experienced anything similar, a very intense contact with nature,\
  \ with natural beauty - even with wild animals like lizards, frogs, spiders and\
  \ even snakes!\nGastronomy. Where to start? Meat, bread, fresh juices, coconut water,\
  \ brocolli rice, esfira, everything you might imagine at the beach. But it is not\
  \ fast food - it is a cultural and artistic to show to the world the brazilian free\
  \ spirit.  Half of the price of a regular dish in Europe, but twice the flavour!\n\
  About my worst fear, I have to admit that during a week, I have never experienced\
  \ any robbery or personal attack, neither a pickpocket target. I learn that you\
  \ have to be low profile, shorts and tshirt and probably nothing bad will happen\
  \ during your trip through that amazing city and cheerful people. \nI can say clearly\
  \ that was a decision that pushed me to the edge, but a very good decision! Inspite\
  \ of pushing my banck account to the edge, my uncertanty of making a good decision,\
  \ my fear of reptiles, amphibious and the decision to visit a very dangerous city,\
  \ I should admit it was the best thing I have decided to do in 2017! \nSo, let your\
  \ soul and eyes discover something new in 2018, dont overthink to much and GO!"
