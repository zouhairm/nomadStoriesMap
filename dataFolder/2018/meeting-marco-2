Text: "A long, muscular man with wild dirty blonde hair, naturally bleached at the\
  \ tips opened the door slowly. His gap toothed yet infectious smile was beaming\
  \ at me like a warm crackling camp fire. His smiling eyes graciously stepped aside\
  \ and ushered me in. \nCeiling to floor marble gave a welcomed cooling from the\
  \ sweltering, mid-march humidity that had been bubbling uncomfortably around me\
  \ for months. Hallways that reached for miles, opened into a sanctuary of luscious\
  \ green, and a deep blue swimming pool glimmered in the afternoon sun. Positive\
  \ I was lost as there was no way my luck thus far could have brought me to a place\
  \ as beautifully perfect, I asked, \u201CSu Marco?\u201D To which the gap toothed\
  \ grinned replied, \u201CSi\u201D\nMarco, a gentle man in his mid forties, lived\
  \ alone and rented his rooms out to passers through. He was german born with a late\
  \ Mexican mother. I melted as he spoke softly for hours, gifting me invaluable local\
  \ knowledge. As he told me of his life I became so overwhelmed with gratitude my\
  \ previous troubles evaporated entirely.\nI had been homeless for six months now\
  \ I and was aware I had not had a single home cooked meal. \nWhether he had a way\
  \ of reading my thoughts or I was that desperately transparent he curiously asked\
  \ \u201Cwhat time do you wake up in the morning?\u201D \nNot sure what to make of\
  \ the question and having no agenda myself, I replied \u201Cerm I don't know, perhaps\
  \ 9am?\u201D \nHe smiled his warming gap toothed smile, stood and said \u201Cbuenos\
  \ noches\u201D \nThen disappeared.\nWaking the next morning, I yawned and stretched\
  \ my arms out letting go of the last of my built up anxiety. I opened my door to\
  \ greet the morning air and looked towards my feet. Concealed beneath a soft white\
  \ cloth, a tiny corner of a woven wicker basket peeped out. Lifting the cover, I\
  \ was greeted by the comforting smell of freshly baked bread. Still warm, I could\
  \ feel the steamy softness reaching up, out of the basket. Bathing in the freshness\
  \ was a bowl of lime and chili flecked, velvet guacamole. Perfectly ripe tomatoes\
  \ and farm fresh eggs placed carefully alongside. I sat and enjoyed the most wholesome\
  \ and meaningful breakfast, I will ever have. \nThe warmth and kindness shown from\
  \ this local man who knew nothing but my name and arrival date knew no bounds. \
  \ I was alone yes but I was no longer scared or anxious. I was ready to venture\
  \ back out into the world with a new found desire to provide others with the same\
  \ overwhelming sense of gratitude and belonging that Marco gave me."
