Text: "Last year I travelled from Bangkok to London, with a 9-hour layover in Kuala\
  \ Lumpur. I took advantage of the stop and popped into the city to see the magnificent\
  \ architecture and eat some delicious cuisine in KL\u2019s Little India. I traced\
  \ a transit map with my finger to figure out how to get from the KL Sentral station\
  \ to KLCC- the location of the famous Petronas Twin Towers, whose image is synonymous\
  \ with Kuala Lumpur. I was damp from the humidity and eagerness\u2013 excitedly\
  \ nervous about being in an unfamiliar place.\n\nMy personal strategy for quickly\
  \ getting to know a place I have never been to before is this: learn the transit\
  \ system.\n\nAt first, I got on the wrong transit line by jumping onto the monorail\
  \ instead of the light rail, but eventually found the correct route and took a seat\
  \ on the frigid, air-conditioned train. Two seats to my right sat a middle-aged\
  \ Malaysian woman. Across from me were two Malaysian girls in their early twenties\
  \ sitting a couple seats apart. The four of us, distracted by our phones, did not\
  \ acknowledge each other but every so often we would take turns glancing up to see\
  \ what stop we were at.\n\nAt one of those stops, the train doors opened and in\
  \ lumbered a rambunctious, loud- mouthed man dressed in shorts and a t-shirt. He\
  \ sat between the two girls, took off his sandals and put his bare feet up on the\
  \ seat to his left. There was something about this man that made the four of us\
  \ sit up a little straighter. He startled one of the girls by obnoxiously asking\
  \ her something in Malaysian. From the way he gestured, I assumed he was asking\
  \ for directions. Wide-eyed, she replied, pointing in the opposite direction of\
  \ our train\u2019s route. He coughed, let out an expletive, hurriedly put on his\
  \ sandals and stumbled out the door before it closed.\n\nAs soon as he was gone,\
  \ all four of us looked at each other and burst out into a harmonious laugh. In\
  \ camaraderie, we relaxed back into our seats. The three women started chatting\
  \ in Malaysian but they kept me engaged in the conversation with their glances and\
  \ smiles. We sat there in a shared experience, our smiles the universal language.\
  \ We each got off at our respective stops, probably never to see each other again.\
  \ But for that one harmonious moment, our four journeys became synched."
