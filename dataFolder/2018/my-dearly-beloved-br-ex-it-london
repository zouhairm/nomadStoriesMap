Text: "My dearly beloved London, \nDo you remember when I first moved in? You might\
  \ have been centuries older than me, but those times were way more innocent for\
  \ both of us. \nThere\u2019s no point in hiding that I was completely smitten by\
  \ you back in 2008. It seemed like you held all the clues. Your personal history\
  \ neither made you dark nor twisted. You\u2019ve learnt from your past and it made\
  \ you even more open. You were so infectiously free and accepting of others, when\
  \ we met, that it taught me to truly love and accept myself. \nI wasn\u2019t that\
  \ well-travelled then, but I didn\u2019t have to leave your side to start learning\
  \ more about cultures. People instantly give you credit for your sophistication,\
  \ education and class. Yet, your Commonwealth and EU families taught you so much\
  \ more I\u2019d rather credit you for:\n- Some assume that it\u2019s your cousin\
  \ Lyon, who is a foodie. They just don\u2019t realise that those world-famous British\
  \ \u201CTelly\u201D chefs are borrowing from you. (On that note, was it possible\
  \ not to fall for you, once I\u2019ve tried your diverse your street food can be?)\n\
  - Others assume that it\u2019s your brother Paris who is a fashionista. They are\
  \ yet to discover that Vivienne Westwood and Alexander McQueen were inspired by\
  \ your street style, my dear. From cookie creativity of Camden all the way to classy\
  \ sophistication of the West end, it is you, who inspired everybody from Oscar Wilde\
  \ to Amy Winehouse. \nI could go on and on comparing you to others, but there is\
  \ no comparison for me. You simply look, sound, smell and even taste like cultural\
  \ diversity. Yes, you still do! \nOr do you really? I\u2019ve heard you sound like\
  \ a racially-charged bus fight that other time. \n\nThat Brexit nonsense must really\
  \ mess with your head. How else would you explain why I almost got evicted from\
  \ my rental when I injured my leg?\nLuckily, despite you throwing a Brexit tantrum,\
  \ you were still hosting some of your extended family members. It was right then\
  \ and there, when your extended family stood up for me, that I realised why we all\
  \ love you.\nWe are only human. Eventually, we stop being smitten by your unparalleled\
  \ beauty. Plus, those of us who genuinely love you, were never really seduced by\
  \ your extreme wealth or billionaires.\n It is your emotional intelligence and multifaceted\
  \ personality that I fell for all these years ago. \nI believe in you. You always\
  \ learn from your mistakes. Just remember that I\u2019m human and I desperately\
  \ hope to be around, when you come back to your senses. \nNo longer yours, \nYelena"
