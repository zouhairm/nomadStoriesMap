Text: "Two entrances, one to the diner the other for take outs, I went in searching\
  \ for a quick meal. A quick meal before visiting the local Waterstones. Les's Fish\
  \ Bar it was called. Planked floors with simple tables and chairs that could have\
  \ come out of the 'Diner Selection' from IKEA. Atop each table was the generic vinegar\
  \ and salt with a brochure liked menu squeeze between them. Sitting right across\
  \ from the counter, and a glanced at the menu the waiter came over. She was like\
  \ the English Grandma one always imagine when thinking about the country sides of\
  \ England. She was small in stature but still had strength and purpose in her walk\
  \ with kind and patient eyes. I cannot remember her name. \n\n\"What would it be?\"\
  \ I could just hear the 'deary' that could have ended that question.\n\"Ugh, could\
  \ I have the fish and chip and a sprite.\" \n\"Is that all?\"\n\"Oh... could I have\
  \ curry on top as well.\"\n\"Sure! Spicy or Fruity?\"\n\"Spicy, thank you.\"\n\"\
  You're welcome.\" She walked off with my order.\n\nI was in Crewe, Cheshire, England.\
  \ I had been there for a few months pursuing my degree mainly cooking my own meals.\
  \ On occasion I would take a walk into town which would take roughly 20-25 minutes\
  \ depending how fast I walked. \n\nI've eaten fish and chip before in my country,\
  \ Malaysia and also in England but that was the first time I tried it with curry.\
  \ I heard of this strange combination when I past by the store on my last visit\
  \ into town. I was appalled and greatly curious. Not that I'm not used to 'strange'\
  \ food or considered 'normal' from where I come from. I've eaten my fair share of\
  \ animal innards and fruits that the uninitiated would be disgusted at trying. \n\
  \nYet, i could not help but be greatly disturbed at this combination. The food came\
  \ hot with a thick slobbering of thick gravy like curry across the fried fish. The\
  \ curry was almost like a sauce. It reminded me of the curry and rice I had in Japan.\
  \ Only now the rice was fries, the chicken the fish, and the similar curry ladled\
  \ over it.\n\nTaking the knife and fork wrapped in pink tissue brought together\
  \ with the food. I cut into it and took my first bite.  The crispiness of the fish\
  \ mix well with the slight salty spiciness of the curry. The fries were thick and\
  \ looked homemade. I didn't even need to add salt and vinegar and I devour the entire\
  \ plate. It was a simple meal from a simple restaurant in the countryside of England\
  \ but it gave me a lasting impression of Crewe and a new definition to the phrase\
  \ 'east meet west'."
