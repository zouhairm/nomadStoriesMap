Text: "Within the imaginations of everyone who's creative ideas and thoughts are inspired\
  \ or influenced by anything seen on television, read in a book or magazine, can\
  \ become their travel reality. MJL\n\nI was influenced by television shows like\
  \ Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom, hosted by Marlin Perkins, National Geographic\
  \ magazines and the used encyclopedias my mother bought. I remember the days of\
  \ quickly skimming through the magazines looking at the pictures especially the\
  \ National Geographics.\n\nThe destinations I viewed of the world intrigued, influenced,\
  \ and inspired my ideas of travel based merely on my curiosity to explore and see\
  \ the locations in person. \nI have travel to allow my eyes to gaze upon the beauty\
  \ of the immense Grand Canyon's rock formations with its colorful striations. \n\
  \nThe grandeur of California's Red Wood trees had my eyes in amazement while my\
  \ presence in the groves of trees gave me goosebumps preventing me from touching\
  \ a tree for well over an hour in honor of its beauty. \n\nMy family, friends and\
  \ blog post followers have viewed my photographs, read about my travel destinations,\
  \ and some are influenced to step beyond the edge of their travel fears to experience\
  \ in person what satisfies my soul, while others live vicariously through what experience.\n\
  \nWhat I believe and know, is everyone has within themselves the courage to do anything\
  \ imagined, desired and created within their mind. But, it is fear, rooted deeply\
  \ in themselves, denying their opportunity to travel.\n\nIf you dream freely of\
  \ your desires but, fearful of the journey. I recommend looking at a mirror and\
  \ search within your heart and soul to seize the day and step over the edge of dreams\
  \ to fulfill your travel reality. \n\nDream of your courageous journey, to influence\
  \ your reality. MJL"
