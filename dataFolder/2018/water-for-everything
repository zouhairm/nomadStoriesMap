Text: "An unfamiliar coffee-pot ding disrupts my morning reading. I\u2019m still in\
  \ bed in my small room, where the clean walls and edges create one white blur, beginnings\
  \ and endings unclear. Folded towels sit on the dresser. Spanish language books\
  \ line the shelves.\n\nFor a month I\u2019ve lived with Raquel and her nine-year-old\
  \ daughter in Alcal\xE1 de Henares, Spain, Miguel de Cervantes\u2019 birthplace.\
  \ While the town feels intimate with its cobble-stoned streets and friendly townies,\
  \ we\u2019re close enough to Madrid that we have to count the minutes of our showers.\
  \ Each time I make my way down the narrow hallway to the bathroom, towel in hand,\
  \ Raquel appears from her bedroom to remind me, \u201C\xA1Cinco minutos!\u201D spreading\
  \ her palm before me to ensure I comprehend. I nod and decide I won\u2019t shave\
  \ my legs, again.\n\nRaquel doesn\u2019t speak a lick of English, which I respect,\
  \ considering how many Americans have likely tried to teach her while staying here.\
  \ The wrinkles around her eyes when she smiles speak to generations of a happy,\
  \ hard-working family.\n\nThis morning when enter the kitchen Raquel is standing\
  \ near the sink by the only window in the room, cigarette in hand, her daily posture.\
  \ When she isn\u2019t smoking, her gravelly laugh makes her habit known. As a twenty-year-old\
  \ traveling alone, I desperately wish she\u2019d offer me one, though she doesn\u2019\
  t. \n\nI ask about the coffee pot; it\u2019s new. She shows me the trash can, full\
  \ of my old to-go coffee cups. I laugh and she gestures toward the coffee, voil\xE0\
  . I sense the familiar resentment of high-maintenance Americans who use too much\
  \ water for everything. Who use too much everything.\n\nRaquel brings over the coffee\
  \ but pours it into my bowl of cereal. Considering the amount of water it took to\
  \ make half a pot, I don\u2019t correct her, and I eat my cereal with milk and coffee.\
  \ She must have seen an American do this on TV.\n\nSpaniards here want to please\
  \ foreigners but are proud of their ease of living. They eat well, but never waste\
  \ a scrap. They gather in the squares each summer night, hoping the fountains will\
  \ come on but also accepting that dwindling likelihood. \n\nAfter dinner on my last\
  \ night in Alcal\xE1, Raquel and I talk by the kitchen window with wine. She notices\
  \ how much my Spanish has improved, and I do feel more confident in my speaking,\
  \ more honest. I\u2019m thirsty but afraid to ask for water, so I have more wine.\
  \ She sees me eyeing her cigarette as she takes a drag. After a moment, she slides\
  \ the pack across the counter. She nods. And we smoke."
