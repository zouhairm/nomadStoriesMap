Text: "The last thing I expected\u2026..was to find beauty and adventure in my life!\n\
  \nHave you ever had that feeling when you want to hide but your light and desires\
  \ inside you are SO bright you shine anyway and you attract beautiful encounters,\
  \ experiences, people and adventure!\n\nDo you find yourself asking how do i create\
  \ these magical moments? Are we ready for our desires or are we afraid to explore\
  \ the abundance within ourselves? We are like a light beam looking for connection\
  \ to our purpose, to people that see us and have the same attraction to life, connection\
  \ to a place of belonging, a place that takes us out of the ordinary and makes us\
  \ feel like we exist!\n\nThe feeling of escape that is a shared experience both\
  \ physically and emotional that constantly nurtures our inner spirit. \n\nI live\
  \ my spirit of adventure through my children, today was one of those magical days\
  \ where we purposely found ourselves creating connection to people we are drawn\
  \ too and letting them know they make this world beautiful! \n\nMy four year old\
  \ daughter said \u2018mum this world is beautiful\u2019 and I said \u2018because\
  \ YOU are in it and your SMILE makes this world beautiful!\n\nOur sense of adventure\
  \ has taken us to places unknown as we kayak amongst nature after a busy day at\
  \ school, we feel a sense of freedom in our own world away from the world.\nNature\
  \ is where we feel connected and grounded to ourselves creating that same feeling\
  \ in my daily life by wearing the color blue and green \n\nI love living in the\
  \ Bay, the view of the landscape is forever changing, my feet dance under the moon\
  \ with sand under my feet, soft pink sky's take me to a place of stillness, the\
  \ sound of water dancing or dew drops left behind, there are infinite places near\
  \ and far.\n\nThe Mount is a place where most people like to go to get their dose\
  \ of happiness, as I find myself trekking up to the top, tiptoeing with a four year\
  \ old on my back!\n\nMy mantra is to create a life of adventure that is irresistible\
  \ and inspiring for my children and others to shine too!\n\nLife doesn\u2019t just\
  \ happen, there is an element of magic and connection that will come when we go\
  \ looking for adventure and search the unknown desires of our heart.\n\nMy greatest\
  \ experience of freedom and adventure has come from a place of feeling LOST!\n\n\
  If we can imagine fear then we can imagine a realm of happiness and BEAUTY within\
  \ ourselves to be LIVED and to create that sense of freedom and adventure!"
