Text: "I was approaching 30 and I was restless. I should have had all of life\u2019\
  s clich\xE9s in order. I should have known what I wanted and I should have been\
  \ working my butt off to get it. I should have had goals and convictions and tenacity\
  \ and reasonable dreams. \n\nBut I didn\u2019t have any of this. I had just been\
  \ through a terrible break-up and family crises, and I just wanted to run away.\
  \ So I boarded a plane across the world to spend a year living a life of adventure\
  \ and spontaneity through Europe and Southeast Asia. I felt so brave as I envisioned\
  \ all of my upcoming Instagram photos and stories. Hiking with new friends in the\
  \ Scottish highlands. Spotting da Vinci originals in Italy. Dancing in the streets\
  \ of Bangkok. Some ocean shots, some mountain shots, and lots of late night pub\
  \ crawl shots.\n\nI was so focused on the more exciting and daring aspects of my\
  \ trip that I kind of just forgot about the day-to-day mundane aspects of solo travel.\
  \ I forgot that in between all of this, a significant portion of my travels would\
  \ be spent alone, confused by new city transit routes, staring at maps, staring\
  \ at my phone, nodding off on trains and buses, awkwardly trying to figure out who\
  \ I wanted to befriend, longing for some privacy to go to the bathroom, budgeting\
  \ every meal, buying groceries, cooking, packing and unpacking, maneuvering my way\
  \ out of unwanted pick-ups. And that\u2019s just day one.\n\nI realized quickly\
  \ that a nomadic lifestyle is not a cure for life\u2019s hang-ups and uncertainties.\
  \ At times it may be a sufficient distraction, but I found that long-term travel\
  \ highlighted my insecurities even more. Hiking in Scotland\u2019s highlands reminded\
  \ me that I need to make exercise and healthy eating a priority. Italian couples\
  \ making out all over the streets of Rome reminded me that I want and deserve passion.\
  \ Being served by poor families in Koh Phangan reminded me that I should never take\
  \ my simple and secure small-town upbringing for granted. I felt rejuvenated in\
  \ the mundane struggles and simple pleasures I observed in every place I visited.\n\
  \nWhile travel can and should be adventurous and exciting, it can also be an opportune\
  \ time to learn contentment. There was no running away for me; the same unanswerable\
  \ questions I planned to leave at home were to be found in every culture I encountered.\
  \ And this was exciting! This is what changed me! This, travel\u2019s way of pushing\
  \ one to embrace the unknown, is what I needed."
