Text: "It was an odd journey. \n\nSat upon my cosy bunk-shelf, I was off to traverse\
  \ the glory of Mother Russia on the world\u2019s most famous railway \u2013 the\
  \ Trans-Siberian. Two weeks ago I had been a mere exchange student in St. Petersburg,\
  \ sent to practice my verbs of motion in the old imperial capital. Instead, I had\
  \ planned to escape the glittering European streets in favour of something ... well,\
  \ a bit more Russian. \n\nArmed with a pair of very permeable trainers and a brightly\
  \ coloured blue and yellow backpack that probably marked me out as a passionate\
  \ Ukrainian patriot, I had decided that going to Siberia at its chilliest time of\
  \ year was a fabulous notion. I fancied myself as the Indiana Jones of the Siberian\
  \ tundra, intent on reaching the famous Lake Baikal before the week was out.\n\n\
  My adventure truly began on the fourth day of my train travels when I awoke to find\
  \ six curious eyes staring back at me. Although I had become accustomed to the gentle\
  \ chug of the engine and its effortless glide through the white winter snow, I had\
  \ never woken up to find three men on my bunk. Until now.\n\nWhile Sergey offered\
  \ me a pint of vodka, Boris generously relinquished a dried fish. Vladimir however,\
  \ wanted to discuss the existence of God.\n\n\u201CWhat a rather unusual breakfast,\u201D\
  \ I thought.\n\nWanting to offer something in return, I remembered my secret bowl\
  \ of cheesy pasta. Sadly forgotten about for so long, it had fermented into a dubious\
  \ paste at the bottom of my backpack. When I attempted to unsuccessfully remove\
  \ the lid, my new friends offered up their muscles, only to find the suspect cheese\
  \ had melted into splendid superglue. The bowl subsequently floated down the train\
  \ carriage, passing from beefcake to beefcake, as its conquest would crown the alpha\
  \ among us. When it reached the guard, an elderly grandmother with angry eyebrows,\
  \ the bowl succumbed in an instant. \n\nApplause erupted along the carriage. \n\
  The defeat of the no-nonsense pasta bowl warranted an even greater exchange of fish,\
  \ vodka, and mystical discussion - much to Vladimir\u2019s joy. In that moment,\
  \ I wondered whether I would ever again find myself toasting the demise of my rancid\
  \ leftovers.\n\nAs if he had read my thoughts, Sergey turned to me and said,\n\u201C\
  This is very strange. But of course it is, this is Russia!\u201D\n\nThe terrific\
  \ trio gave a mighty chuckle as the train began to brake. Handing me a new mystery\
  \ fish as a parting gift, Boris excitedly pointed outside to the station where my\
  \ next train lay trembling in wait."
