Text: "Paving way through thick deodar forests of Himalayas, it felt like I had teleported\
  \ into these dense jungles, right out of my office cubicle. We were few minutes\
  \ away from our next base camp at 11,000 feet on one of Asia\u2019s largest meadows,\
  \ \u201CBedni and Auli Bugyal\u201D. These were sprawling meadows with steep slopes\
  \ carpeted by lush green grass. One could see mules grazing and hear bells tinkling\
  \ in their necks distinctly through hilly silence. Floating above these meadows,\
  \ were pearly white clouds scattered in the blue skies. It seemed like God sited\
  \ an enormous garden amidst the mighty Himalayas. I could feel my tiny existence\
  \ against His magnificent and naturally raw creations. \nWith camp in sight, we\
  \ unloaded our bags and crashed on ground. The light breeze soaking my sweat and\
  \ the soft grass bed, felt better than the luxurious hotels that I stayed in so\
  \ far. Although I was more than happy with this trek until now, I had not anticipated\
  \ what more the night had in store.\nAround 2 AM when I got out of my tent to take\
  \ a leak, only sound audible was of barking dogs and jingling bells tied to cattle.\
  \ Least expected in the pitch darkness was a human voice that said, \u201CCareful\
  \ mate, I am sitting here on the ground\u201D. Startled out of my wits I put on\
  \ my torch, only to find a fellow teammate. He signaled me not to make noise and\
  \ keep torchlight to minimum, as there were mountain dogs around, trained to rip\
  \ off any one who moved in direction of sheep. \nWhile he was setting up his camera\
  \ to get a good picture of night sky, I looked up and was awestruck at what I saw.\
  \ Speckled with a million stars it was the starriest sky I had ever seen. Along\
  \ with countless stars, I saw Milky Way too. As learnt in school, it was not spiral,\
  \ rather scattered. As if a painter had brushed a streak of shining purple in the\
  \ illuminated sky, it floated like a gigantic cloud in the center. This breathtakingly\
  \ beautiful spectacle faraway in sky made us oblivious to the freezing cold around\
  \ us. With him trying to get a perfect shot and I gazing at those stars for as long\
  \ as I could, this experience at a height of 11,000 feet at 2 AM was an exhilarating\
  \ one. The picture saved in my brain was clearer than any DSLR camera could have\
  \ captured. Like those radium sheets of night sky that my parents used to embellish\
  \ the room ceiling when I was a kid, this felt same: only more real with other million\
  \ stars. I laid awake staring, wishing I could become one of them, just like when\
  \ I was a kid."
