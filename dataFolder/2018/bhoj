Text: "Another gargantuan cough echoes through the stillness of these Himalayan hills\
  \ and I'm pretty sure that last one's killed him. I look behind. Not this time.\
  \ On he goes, wheezing and sputtering like a smoking bronchitis patient.\n\nTrekking\
  \ guides are often young, athletic leaders capable of amazing feats like rock climbing,\
  \ marathon running, and getting up from a chair on the first attempt. The one I've\
  \ been given is somewhat different. Following me is Bhoj, an elderly Magur from\
  \ the Myagdi region, who has a penchant for drinking hot tea around a fire and a\
  \ piousness and belly to outweigh the great Buddha himself.\n\nHe is also the slowest\
  \ guide in the Annapurna range. Tens of thousands of trekkers come here every year\
  \ to complete this compelling circuit clich\xE9: charmed by cairns, impossibly detailed\
  \ stupas, and paths forged by pilgrims from another time and place. I know this\
  \ because I've been overtaken by each one along the way while waiting for Bhoj at\
  \ every fork and turn. \n\nAs a serial trekker, time taken to complete a course\
  \ is quite important to me and already we are eighteen days into what was supposed\
  \ to be a fourteen day blitz.\n \nFinally, I reach the quiescent town of Ghorepani,\
  \ and Bhoj arrives a minute later, announced by another clamorous coughing fit.\
  \ From here we can see the panoramic of peaks that make this region so attractive\
  \ to outsiders like me. Slopes like ancient stalagmites intrude on ineffable skies,\
  \ all decorated with prayer flags that send their reassuring mantra OM MANI PADME\
  \ HUM on the wind through chasms and valleys thousands of feet deep.\n\nAfter Bhoj\
  \ has drawn heavy breaths, I ask if the place he lives is anything like this. He\
  \ begins a story about how his village and house were destroyed last year by an\
  \ earthquake. All that's left still are piles of debris he says. Because of that\
  \ he's been forced back into guiding again, struggling up and down these mountains\
  \ every day of the year just to earn enough money to rebuild his house. A staggering\
  \ symbol of the fragility of prosperity.\n\nHe tells me that Buddhism teaches him\
  \ that suffering is a necessary and unavoidable part of life. Bhoj doesn't see himself\
  \ as too old or unfit to suffer through this every day, just that he can withstand\
  \ whatever is necessary to give his family what they need.\n\nAs we stand together,\
  \ I think back over the last few weeks of frustration; the waiting; the late morning\
  \ starts; the fortuity of circumstance; and I think again who has more right to\
  \ complain."
