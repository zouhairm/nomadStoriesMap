Text: "After a pleasant Sunday morning on the beach in Panglao, Yachi and I were planning\
  \ to have lunch at the Bee Farm, a restaurant famous for its biological cuisine\
  \ and honey ice cream. However, we were struggling to find a tricycle that could\
  \ take us there. It was already noon, and the locals - including the drivers - were\
  \ getting together for barbeque on the seaside. We walked on the sand for a while,\
  \ until we found a bald man idly standing near a tricycle. \n\n'Let's ask him' Yachi\
  \ suggested. We approached him nonchalantly and greeted him. Then, I asked how much\
  \ he would charge for the route.\n\n'Sorry, this isn't my tricycle. I'm just waiting\
  \ for my wife' he replied. We nodded politely and left the beach. \n\nSince there\
  \ was no apparent solution, we decided to go up the hill in the direction of the\
  \ main road. Maybe there we could find someone willing to give us a ride.  On our\
  \ way, we crossed eyes with an indolent goat and a group of children playing hide\
  \ and seek. But there were no signs of drivers in the area. We were about to give\
  \ up when a car stopped in front of us and someone shouted from the inside:\n\n\
  'Need a ride somewhere?'\n\nIt was the bald man from before! We explained to him\
  \ that we wanted to go to the Bee Farm.\n\n'Oh, I know where that is. We can drop\
  \ you there on our way home'.\n\nWe promptly got into the vehicle and said Maayong\
  \ Hapon (Good afternoon) to his wife, his daughter and her grandmother, who sat\
  \ on the trunk. They told us that they had all been born and raised in Bohol, the\
  \ province to which Panglao island belonged. They were very curious about us, where\
  \ we had come from, what our impressions of the Philippines were, and, just like\
  \ everybody we had met: 'Why Bohol?' Our enjoyable conversation went on for a few\
  \ minutes, until we finally reached our destination. \n\n'Salamat!' we thanked in\
  \ unison. \n\n'Is your home nearby?' Yachi added.\n\n'Actually, we live on the opposite\
  \ side of the island. It's ok, we hope you enjoy your stay in the Philippines'.\
  \ \n\nWe could not believe the thoughtfulness of this family. They drove us to a\
  \ place that they were not going to, and we had not even asked for it. They gave\
  \ us their time, their help - their everything - in exchange for nothing but a smile.\
  \ Their actions moved us to our core. In face of such astonishing selflessness,\
  \ I felt like Blanche on the streets of New Orleans, for I had also \"depended on\
  \ the kindness of strangers\"."
