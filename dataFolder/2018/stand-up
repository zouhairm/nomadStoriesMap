Text: "I\u2019d never met a terrorist before.  Liam was my first, a tall graying man\
  \ with blue eyes.  I followed him as we wound through West Belfast\u2019s web of\
  \ Catholic neighborhoods; the very same ones that Liam and the rest of the IRA had\
  \ fought for. \n\nThe streets were gray and glistening with rain.  Ahead of us,\
  \ wet cement.  To our right, wet cement.  To our left, a 20-foot barricade of propaganda\
  \ made of, you guessed it, wet cement.  It\u2019s called the Peace Wall, built to\
  \ divide the Protestant and Catholic neighborhoods of Belfast.  Grim murals swept\
  \ along its surface and out of sight, armies of chipping green uniforms and anti-loyalist\
  \ slurs compressed into one 2-dimensional call to arms.  \n\n \u201CSTAND UP.\u201D\
  \  Liam hardly glanced at the blinding red slogan. \u201CFIGHT BACK.\u201D  The\
  \ wall bled defiance. \n\nAs we walked, Liam described the nationalist uprising\
  \ in Northern Ireland during the late 1900s.  Bombings, shootings, terror, death;\
  \ the cost of liberation was high.  \u201CWe had to do what we did though, at the\
  \ time.  Didn\u2019t all go as we planned it, not all of it was right, but it\u2019\
  s the only way they\u2019d listen.\u201D \n\nWe paused at a sky blue mural while\
  \ Liam continued to speak. \n\n\u201CI was in prison for a little o\u2019er 10 years.\
  \ Most of my friends were dead by the time I got out.\u201D  Liam pointed to a face\
  \ on the mural.  \u201CJim Ryan, he was a good one.  Killed the year I went to prison,\
  \ they shot him at the bakery.  Baker was a Protestant, he jumped in the way, tried\
  \ to save Jim, but the Protestants killed the baker then they killed Jim too.\u201D\
  \  \n\nLiam took me to a break in the wall.  Where we currently stood was Catholic\
  \ territory.  Ahead was Protestant Belfast; a place that, 20 years after the Good\
  \ Friday Agreement, Liam still could not go.  \u201CYer other guide will meet ye\
  \ here.\u201D  He smiled.  \u201CBest of luck.\u201D\n\nI stood, a Catholic, at\
  \ the bridge between worlds.  My new guide, a Protestant, would bring me into East\
  \ Belfast, the Belfast where Jim Ryan was shot and Liam served his 10 years.  My\
  \ new guide, a Protestant, would tell me his story, we would pass his dead friends,\
  \ he would use the words \u201Csneaky,\u201D \u201Cmerciless,\u201D and \u201Cterrorist.\u201D\
  \  We\u2019d go where he ran to when he heard the blast; when he arrived it was\
  \ rubble, and he followed the screams, and he found an arm reaching and he pulled\
  \ the arm free but no person came with it.\n\nMy new guide, the Protestant, had\
  \ arrived.  His eyes were also blue.  He stretched out his hand in greeting, and\
  \ with a smile I stepped into his half of the world."
