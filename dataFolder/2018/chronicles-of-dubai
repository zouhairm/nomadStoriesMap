Text: "On a visit to Dubai, United Arab Emirates, it is not until I go off into the\
  \ desert that I really meet any actual local people.\nThe camels and a short drive\
  \ out of the city brings me to rolling sand dunes stretching to the horizon. Longer\
  \ routes explore remote wadis (dry riverbeds) and desert oases that seem unchanged\
  \ for centuries.\nIn Dubai, dune bashing, driving off a high sand dune at high With\
  \ no light pollution, and no cloud cover, the stars shine brilliantly. Stare long\
  \ enough and you can feel yourself falling into them. Over a flickering fire and\
  \ strong coffee \u2013 \u201CBedouin whisky\u201D \u2013 the romance of the desert\
  \ comes alive in stories of past adventures and a battle of wits over riddles (one\
  \ I lose as I am unarmed), before a night in a traditional tent.\nIn the light of\
  \ day, parts of the desert are less romantic, covered in burst tires, discarded\
  \ water bottles and other rubbish, the loss of contact with the environment in some\
  \ ways a metaphor for Dubai itself. Then a gust of wind sends sand to soften the\
  \ outlines of the man-made objects as it starts to bury them and make all clean\
  \ again.\nIn the distance, a camel train pads towards the horizon, its bearded herders\
  \ walking alongside in long robes, silent and timeless.\nAnd I  spent four days\
  \ in Dubai and I think I spent about $200. For that I got four nights at a hostel,\
  \ fantastic food every day, a t-shirt from the Dubai Mall, a ticket to the top of\
  \ the Burj Khalifa, at ticket to the Dubai Mall Cinema, several gallons of bottled\
  \ water, a cab ride in Lexus from the airport to my hostel, and about half a dozen\
  \ metro tickets. Not a bad deal altogether.\nTo see the Burj Khalifa and ended up\
  \ being more impressed by the Mall. Most of The Mall is four stories, although some\
  \ places are only two or three. There is a shark tank, an ice rink, a theater (where\
  \ I watched Sicario), and more shops than you could possibly visit in a day. The\
  \ most fascinating part of The Mall is the way it changes shape and character. Some\
  \ areas are plush and luxurious, other areas have a strong Arabic influence, and\
  \ a couple of places are dark and modern. It felt like walking between different\
  \ continents\nUnfortunately my time was running out along with checking out the\
  \ Dubai Marina, will be for next time. I had so much fun that I\u2019d really like\
  \ to go back again for a week or two. Definitely during the cooler months though.\
  \ It was 90 degrees every day which is fine as long as you pound the water. 115\
  \ degrees in the summer though, forget it!."
