Text: "As I drew in breaths of air through a tube, half submersed in the refreshingly\
  \ salty waters of St. John, he - or was it she - swam by me, welcoming me in, but\
  \ reminding me to respect my new environment. A beautiful six foot nurse shark gracefully\
  \ owned its territory in the shallow waters as I snorkeled by in awe. \n\nI had\
  \ just arrived days before from spending my time in a cramped up, cinder-block-styled-wall\
  \ dorm room to spending every possible second in the sodium rich, warm waters of\
  \ the island of St. John. The first to welcome me was a woman behind a bright blue\
  \ cart with a sign that read \u201CFREE RUM SAMPLES\u201D, but the most intriguing\
  \ native to welcome me was the silky smooth nurse shark.\n\nWhat first drew me in\
  \ was the feeling of serenity from floating through the ocean as the sparkling sun\
  \ beams broke through the water to illuminate the life below the surface. The first\
  \ guest to greet me was a sea turtle with perfectly imperfect geometric shapes painted\
  \ on its shell. Next was the stingray gliding ever so gracefully just feet below\
  \ me. My favorite, however, was the shark. \n\nSharks are known for their violent\
  \ tendencies, but of course this is all a myth. The nurse shark I encountered welcomed\
  \ me into its habitat and allowed me to swim alongside for a brief moment before\
  \ carrying on its duties of its contribution to maintaining the ecosystem it resides\
  \ in. \n\nIn everyday life, the world of the shark and the world of my own are quite\
  \ paralleled. Not in a way in which they are similar, although I suppose connections\
  \ could be made, but in a way that they never cross paths. My mind would not typically\
  \ give the time of day to a nurse shark hundreds and hundreds of miles away from\
  \ me. \n\nAlthough this wildlife creature did not have the ability to verbally communicate\
  \ with me in his home, he is highly skilled at communicating through body language.\
  \ We spoke in the non conventional sense, as he swam by peacefully, causing no harm,\
  \ and I did the same, giving a mutual respect for each other in a place where we\
  \ both recognized peace and tranquility to be important values. \n\nWhile this moment\
  \ was brief in time, it will last me forever. This peaceful, tranquil feeling is\
  \ one I will seek in every adventure I take. With every moment of excitement and\
  \ unknown will come a feeling of pure joy and happiness.\n\nPutting fear aside and\
  \ appreciating the little moments can teach us more than we can fathom."
