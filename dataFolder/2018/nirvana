Text: "I was sitting in a metro in New Delhi. Suddenly I felt the urge to run. Next\
  \ I was sitting in a shabby bus, which was taking me to Rishikesh. It is 230 kms\
  \ from New Delhi. I reached Haridwar at one am, Rishikesh is 20 kms from Haridwar.\
  \ Most of the passengers deboarded at Haridwar. I was left in a bus with four drunk\
  \ men. As we entered the outskirt of the city, I realised I should have deboarded\
  \ too. It was dark, river running on one side of the road and the forest on other.\
  \ Unexpectedly I noticed a small eatery. I asked the bus driver to stop. I took\
  \ the lift from there back to Haridwar from a tourist bus. I got a room in Premnagar\
  \ Ashram. It was clinically clean and I slept in the safety of four walls. Next\
  \ day I took a cab for Rishikesh. Rishikesh was the epitome of colours. I crossed\
  \ a bridge called Laxman Jhula. It literally connects two different world. On its\
  \ one end you could discern devotees, yogis and saints and on the other you would\
  \ think you had come to some hippie era. While roaming around, I spotted an ashram\
  \ called Sant Seva Ashram, situated on the banks of river Ganga. I asked for the\
  \ room closest to the river. My room was plain but had all the amenities and a balcony\
  \ just above river Ganga and I had a personal entrance to the ghat. After few moments\
  \ I went straight to river and swam for hours. Then I spent all afternoon eating,\
  \ taking photographs, talking to vendors, visiting ashrams. Then I went to ghat\
  \ for Ganga Arti. I bought some lamps from a boy aged 13, named Chotu. He used to\
  \ go to school during day and sell lamps at evening to pay school fees. Ganga Arti\
  \ was mystical. Everyone was chanting, thousands of lamps floating on water. After\
  \ Arti, I took Chotu to dinner in a beautiful restaurant called Royal Cafe. It was\
  \ completely lit by candles. Seeing chotu\u2019s excitement gave me immense satisfaction.\
  \ After dinner I bade Chotu goodnight. I ordered some coffee for myself. Suddenly\
  \ a man asked to sit with me. His name was John. We talked about yoga and Indian\
  \ culture. John was shocked to know that Christmas is a public holiday in India.\
  \ After inviting John for yoga class next morning in my ashram, I went to my room.\
  \ Next day during yoga I felt most alive. After an hour of yoga, I felt completely\
  \ calm. Then John and I went to breakfast together. I introduced him to the Indian\
  \ cuisine. We even had chai. Then I went alone for boating and I looked around and\
  \ all I saw is beauty, the uncontaminated beauty. In that moment, I experienced\
  \ Nirvana."
