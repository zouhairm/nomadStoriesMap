Text: "We were fixed with locals to take a walk around the Ezba, the walk started\
  \ from the main space between the houses and the stables, we walked along a drainage\
  \ with three swimming ducks. Some of the houses were made of animals\u2019 waste\
  \ combined with straw and had window holes covered with piles of straw; some chicken\
  \ houses were made from old pottery pots. As for the locals, most men have far away\
  \ jobs , and women are rarely seen outside. The village seemed deserted at first.\
  \ After a while, I spotted a group of young girls who have been following us, they\
  \ seemed shy, they shaded few laughs. When they came closer, I tried to open a conversation\
  \ but they were all still staring in silence, I asked to take their photo, and their\
  \ smiling faces and nodding heads showed they were excited. We kept on walking,\
  \ they kept on following. \nAfter the walk, we sat outside, we were offered tea,\
  \ they had it served in a kettle with tiny 3 cups, we took turns drinking. We \u2013\
  \ as women \u2013 were offered to enter the house, the guest room was empty, it\
  \ had a worn knitted carpet with few cautions. We had a casual talk with the housewife,\
  \ she told us about how the nearest school is 18 km away, girls were pulled out\
  \ of school at the age of 10 because it was risky and expensive.\u201CThey will\
  \ be wives\u201D she said.\nWe went outside and two of the girls were still there.\
  \ One of them finally opened her mouth, she asked If I was going for another walk.\
  \ I wasn\u2019t going to, but she seemed eager, so i followed her. Few seconds later,\
  \ they started asking loads of questions, they talked 60 seconds a minute. \u201C\
  Do you have tall buildings in the city?\u201D asked, she asks a lot. Then Hanan,\
  \ talked, she talks a lot \u201CI once went to my uncle\u2019s house in the village\
  \ and went up on the roof, it was FOUR FLOORS HIGH!\u201D and the talking went on,\
  \ they took me to the canal and climbed palm trees, they told me stories about the\
  \ Ezba. For example, when a woman is a recent bride, she\u2019s not allowed to leave\
  \ the house until at least 15 days have passed on her wedding day. One very unusual\
  \ practice, is fishing from the drainage, they literally electrocute water so that\
  \ fish will surface and they can eat them later. \nI asked if they were in school,\
  \ they weren\u2019t, but they were excited about the nearby community school being\
  \ built, their eyes sparkled. I asked them if they have been friends for long, they\
  \ nodded and smiled to each other. \nThey were so caught up in the moment, they\
  \ had no Idea what was going to happen 3 Month later."
