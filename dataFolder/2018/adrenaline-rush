Text: "\u2018I can't believe I\u2019m going to do this\u2019 I think as I look down\
  \ at my legs swinging freely below me. I tuck my right foot around my left ankle\
  \ to relieve some of the weight and exhale, trying to calm my nerves.\n\nI take\
  \ in my surroundings. The blue sky turning to a dusty yellow where it lands on the\
  \ horizon. The glistening white blanket below me littered with sharp, brown shards.\
  \ It is coming to the end of the season and snow melts fast upon hot, volcanic rock.\n\
  \nThe end of the chairlift is edging closer still, where we will begin our hike\
  \ to the crater lake of Mt Ruapehu.\n\nI push off, keeping the tension in my front\
  \ leg as I come to a stop next to my best friends. They wouldn\u2019t make me do\
  \ this if they thought I wasn't ready, right?\n\nI create a sling out of my second\
  \ layer and fasten my board to my back. The ice crunching underfoot and our slightly\
  \ labored breathing soon become the only sounds as we leave the rest of the field\
  \ behind. It feels like we are the only people in the world, the snow stretches\
  \ out and upwards in front of us as the chairlifts and other skiers fade into specks.\n\
  \n\u2018Shit\u2019 I say as I snap my head up, stopping in my tracks.\n\u2018Lahar\
  \ warning!\u2019 someone else shouts. \nWe all immediately turn sharp right and\
  \ head for higher ground. The top ice layer is thick so we take it in turns to push\
  \ and pull each other up until we finally come to rest on top of a ridge. Breathless.\
  \ Eyes scanning the mountain for signs of blistering lava rushing towards us. \n\
  Eventually\u2026 silence.\n\u201CMust have been a test\u2019 Jon said as he pulls\
  \ a beer from his bag \u2018Good time for a break.\u2019\n\nI sit down and struggle\
  \ to get my heart back to its regular pace. It has just dawned on me what exactly\
  \ we are doing. This is a live stratovolcano which has erupted more than 60 times\
  \ since 1945 and we are climbing to the top so we can snowboard down. It is the\
  \ most terrifying but exhilarating thing I have ever attempted. \n\nThe rest of\
  \ the hike is straightforward if a little uneasy and soon the crater lake is in\
  \ sight. Its beauty and power evident as its unearthly hue captures everyone's senses,\
  \ the myth of this mountain is enthralling yet slightly unsettling. \nI take a moment\
  \ to check the view from 2,672m. National Park and lakes and long, winding roads\
  \ as far as the eye can see. No skyscrapers to break the skyline here. \n\nI exhale\
  \ and strap my feet to my board. Everything I\u2019ve learned this winter season\
  \ sits firmly in my heart. I feel like I\u2019m on the edge of the world and I can\
  \ do anything."
