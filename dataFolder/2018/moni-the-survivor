Text: "I meet Moni in a market in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. I just had breakfast in one\
  \ of the food stalls and I\u2019m walking around the dark maze of the market in\
  \ a quest for coffee. I turn left and see a tiny woman sitting with a cold chocolate.\
  \ \u201CThey must have coffee as well!\u201D I think to myself. The shopkeeper struggles\
  \ to understand me, but the tiny woman speaks a bit of English and helps me.\nShe\
  \ asks where I\u2019m from. \u201CFrance?\u201D And switching to French \u201CI\
  \ was born in France, then we came back to Cambodia\u201D.\n\u2013 When did you\
  \ come back? I ask.\n\u2013 Before 1975.\nThis says it all. That\u2019s before \u2018\
  Year Zero\u2019. Before hell on earth. In the National Museum I learned about the\
  \ madness of Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge. It\u2019s one thing to read stories, it\u2019\
  s another one to meet history in the shape of a skinny woman, sipping a chocolate\
  \ in a dark market aisle. \nI want to talk with her and ask a million questions,\
  \ but I don\u2019t want to reopen old wounds. So I sit next to her and respectfully\
  \ listen as she opens up.\nHere is Moni\u2019s story:\nHer parents were civil servants\
  \ and moved to Paris with her older sister. Moni studied in a convent; she liked\
  \ Paris and the castles in the Loire Valley. They came back to Cambodia when she\
  \ was 14. Anyone who could speak a foreign language was considered an intellectual,\
  \ and was immediately suspected of being an enemy of the regime, risking prison,\
  \ torture and death. \n\n\u201CI\u2019m only alive because when they came for my\
  \ family, my Dad said I was not his daughter. They killed them all\u201D.\n\u201C\
  Later, when I was deported to the fields, I had to say I didn\u2019t know how to\
  \ read or write, or they would kill me as well\u201D.\nTears start rolling down\
  \ my cheeks. She points out my mug of coffee: \u201CWe had that much of rice soup\
  \ per day to share between 40 of us. We would get up at 3am to work in the rice\
  \ fields until 10pm.\u201D\n\nThe ice in her chocolate is all melted. I don\u2019\
  t want to leave, and I feel like she doesn\u2019t want to go either. We\u2019re\
  \ standing outside the market, semi-blinded by the bright sunlight. She goes away\
  \ in a tuk-tuk, but changes her mind, waves at me and offers to drop me to the Royal\
  \ Palace. As we\u2019re cruising the large avenues of the capital, she tells me\
  \ how much the city has changed in the last decade, and how much she loves the riverfront\
  \ and the colonial villas.\nI could spend the day with her but I let her go. As\
  \ she disappears into the traffic I need to sit, overwhelmed. What pushed me to\
  \ turn left in that aisle? I don\u2019t know but I am grateful I met Moni, the survivor."
