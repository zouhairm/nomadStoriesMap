Text: "As we left the village of Kangirsujuak and got into the mountains, the feeling\
  \ of wind, sun and unlimited territory was exhilarating and I could have carried\
  \ on this way endlessly; I was completely confident in Noah's abilities to ride\
  \ these dusty roads on our way to the bay. \nAnother world opened to us as the splendor\
  \ of the navy blue waters popped over a hill crowned with pure white clouds. Noah\
  \ and his son put a huge canoe into the water. A 17,000 $ boat, which arrived damaged\
  \ to the coop. Noah got it for 1,000 and repaired the front which had been crushed\
  \ by mishandling during shipping. \nThe bugs where out, big ones but the wind was\
  \ steady. Another canoe arrived with many people. Their faces were excited.\_\n\
  - Belugas are in the bay, many of them; we are going hunting!\n\nWe hoped in the\
  \ canoe. We saw a seal pepping out and then the belugas appeared like white shadows\
  \ in the waters. \nWe followed two along the shore then turned back to meet up with\
  \ the hunters. I could see the hunter aiming and shouting one time and then they\
  \ pulled the animal close to their canoe.\_\nThe beluga was brought to the rocks\
  \ in shallow waters rapidly covered in a pool of blood. The men started cutting\
  \ the skin in even rectangles, extracting a first layer.\_\nThe animal\u2019s meat\
  \ was then removed, all in a methodic and highly paced manner. An old women kept\
  \ carrying pieces to her own basket and she was screaming with joy.\_\nGathered\
  \ children were helping. The working men were working so hard under the sun. They\
  \ would occasionally stop and slice a piece to eat and chew right on the spot. They\
  \ would also walk around and give some pieces for others to chew and inevitably\
  \ a hand came by me and this was my big encounter with mukktuk, fresh out of the\
  \ water, fresh off of the animal\u2026\nI felt I had to try this country food. I\
  \ took a piece, everything around me made it right, the beauty of the sight, the\
  \ surrounding enthusiasm, I decided to chew and smile. I had a hard time finishing\
  \ but felt no sick feeling in my stomach. When all was cut and shared, when a tooth\
  \ and mukktuk from the head and tail were set aside for the elders,  very little\
  \ was left, but it would be sufficient so that the surrounding camps could get a\
  \ share.\_\nNoah told us that and old man who had lost the use of his legs had been\
  \ asking him recently for some beluga and now his wish had been answered."
