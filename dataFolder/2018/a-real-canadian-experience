Text: "It was the first evening of our adventure across the Canadian Rockies. September,\
  \ the beginning of \u2018Fall\u2019 as my Canadian friends called it. It had fast\
  \ become my favourite time of the year. Not because of those Starbucks pumpkin spiced\
  \ lattes but because of the leaves. They were beginning to turn that beautiful shade\
  \ of orange they are famed for. Rows and rows of them like a magic amber carpet.\
  \ The air smelt that extra bit fresher too as the temperature cooled. A time of\
  \ year that is simply magic.\nOur first stop was Revelstoke, a small town nestled\
  \ on the edge of Alberta but still in \u2018Beautiful British Columbia\u2019, as\
  \ the number plates adorned. They are not wrong, BC is beautiful. My commute to\
  \ work spoiled me with sites of Kitsilano beach and the mountain ranges of West\
  \ Vancouver. Vancouver is 50 shades of blue: blue sea, blue mountains, blue sky\
  \ and blue glass buildings.\nBut back to the adventure.\nThe sky was turning red\
  \ as the evening started rolling in. We took a stroll along the river down a narrow\
  \ and hidden path towards the centre of town. There wasn\u2019t another soul in\
  \ sight and the air was humming with silence. Ten minutes passed when we noticed\
  \ something black moving in the bushes a few metres from us. Hmm, looks like a stray\
  \ dog. A big stray dog? No, wait. A BEAR!\n*Insert all manner of swear words*! Ok,\
  \ don\u2019t panic. I forced out my head that scene from The Revenant (you know\
  \ which one!), that I had, ironically, only watched the evening previously. I cursed\
  \ my na\xEFve self for laughing off advice to buy bear spray and bear bells.\nIn\
  \ this time of crisis, what did I do? Well, I asked Google, of course. What else\
  \ does any modern-day girl do when she needs some solid advice?\n\u201CWalk, don\u2019\
  t run, and keep your eye on the bear so you can see how it will react\u201D.\nThanks,\
  \ Google, but what happens if it reacts badly?!\nSlowly picking up our pace with\
  \ eyes locked to the bear, it stared back from the bushes. It was (thankfully) smaller\
  \ than I expected and rather, well, cute. Cute?! How could I think such things when\
  \ our lives were in such grave danger?!\nThe bear soon returned to its foraging,\
  \ seemingly unfazed by our existence. Phew, we survived! The adrenaline was still\
  \ buzzing and bouncing off us when we bumped into an elderly man walking his dog.\
  \ Warning him to turn around his response took us by surprise, \u201COh, the little\
  \ guy is back, is he?\u201D and he continued up the path towards him.\nIt seems\
  \ we had just met our first local and it was the last thing we expected!"
