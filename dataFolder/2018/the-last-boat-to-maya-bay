Text: "There was a picture in my mind and a headline \u2018Best beaches of the world.\u2019\
  \ I was in a conference room in downtown Bangkok, daydreaming about azure waters\
  \ and a limestone beach. I felt suffocated and wanted to throw my high heels far,\
  \ far away. \n\nI didn\u2019t want to go back to India with memories of skyscrapers.\
  \ I exchanged goodbyes and was flush with excitement.I ran to the hotel lobby with\
  \ my suitcase and asked the concierge to call me a cab.\n\n\u2018Have a flight to\
  \ catch?\u2019 He asked.\n\n\u2018No, I\u2019m going to buy a train ticket to the\
  \ South of Thailand.\u2019 I replied to his surprise.\n\nI spent the night in a\
  \ Thai train eating mango and sticky rice for dinner .I woke up to the sight of\
  \ quaint country stations passing by. I arrived at Surat Thani and found myself\
  \ following a crowd of backpackers to a local bus going to Krabi. Another rickety\
  \ minivan ride later,I received the magical ferry ticket to Phi-Phi island. As we\
  \ reached the ferry, I rushed towards the bow. The vessel started moving and the\
  \ sea was making frothy formations. The backpackers were playing loud music and\
  \ making revelry. Slowly, the sea started changing its colour from dark green to\
  \ aquamarine blue. I felt a sense of calm within and could only hear the waves and\
  \ see the changing hues.\n\nAs I reached Phi- Phi, the place was bustling with activity,\
  \ but it wasn\u2019t the picture in my head. Was it Photoshop? I wondered.\n\nI\
  \ spotted a  board. \u2018 Boat Cruises to Maya Bay . 08:00 hrs to 16.30 hrs.\u2019\
  \ I glanced at my watch. It was nearing 5 o clock, to my disappointment.\n\n\u2018\
  \ Hellooo \u2019  A cherubic woman  called me . 'My husband can take you there.'\n\
  \n\u2018I am Nima\u2019. That is Som, my husband. She gestured towards a wiry man\
  \ with little hair and a sunburnt face. \u2018He just finished his trips for the\
  \ day but I think he could take one last trip. And there I was, in a traditional\
  \ Thai wooden long tail boat, in the middle of the Andaman Sea. The sea dazzled\
  \ at sunset, the golden sky turning red. Nima talked about her family. \n\nWe were\
  \ about halfway when Som called out   \u2018The engine, it stopped, but don\u2019\
  t worry , all will be well!\u2019 \nI panicked, I couldn\u2019t even swim. Nima\
  \ held my hand as Som tried to revive the engine. The boat had slowed and I could\
  \ feel the waves growing . And then, as Som pulled a cord with amazing strength,\
  \ the engine came to life.\n\nI spent the most thrilling twenty minutes of my life\
  \ at Maya Bay. I had just met my own imagination. We returned to the island and\
  \ shared a sumptuous dinner."
