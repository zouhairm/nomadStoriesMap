Text: "I want you to go back, way way back. I want you to return a long time ago in\
  \ a galaxy far, far away.\nSo, we see this guy; this farmboy with a funny haircut\
  \ which, like most teenage, hates his live and blames the grownups; he is pretty\
  \ sure that they are holding him down.\nSo far you could think that i\xB4m talking\
  \ about the main character in a teen movie, but no. Actually i\xB4m talking about\
  \ Luke Skywalker. \nThe rest of the adventure is well known. But i want you to focus\
  \ on what happens in between; what happened with Luke in the time he passed from\
  \ been a wierd looking farmer to the greatest hero in the galaxy. \nWell, i am like\
  \ Luke Skywalker. \nNow, before you think that i am a freak who thinks can manage\
  \ the force by playing with automatic doors you\xB4re wrong...kinda.\nI am like\
  \ Luke cause the first time that the adventure came knocking to my door i said \"\
  no\". \nI was these teen with no plan or idea of what i wanted to do with my life,\
  \ i was just existing, waiting for something to happen. And when it did, i said\
  \ no. But fortunately, life didn\xB4t care about what i had to say. \nA friend of\
  \ mine thought it was a good idea to make me manager of a bar he just bought. \n\
  So i was a having an easy and fun job, i had a girlfriend and she gave to me a dog\
  \ which a loved more than anything in this world. And i was taking a break from\
  \ school. So the life was so good, that got borring.\nMy girlfriend posted my resume.\
  \ Almost immediately i got a call to work in Cancun, one of the coolest,  beautiful\
  \ and wild places on Mexico. They were gonna give me an apartment, a great payed\
  \ job and the experience of living in one of the coolest places to live for a youngman.\n\
  Well, i said no. Yes, i know, whats was i thinking? still said no. They actually\
  \ tried to convince for many days. I use many excuses: my dog, my girlfriend, my\
  \ school. They gave me thousand of solutions, they even agree to fly my dog and\
  \ paying for my plane tickets. \nSo i had no other choice than accept; but i was\
  \ only going for one month.\nAfter a year i decided it was time to go home, not\
  \ before touring south america with the money i made. Soon the company expanded\
  \ to other places so i kept traveling for another year. \nIn that time i wrote a\
  \ lot, didn\xB4t wanted to forget anything; the places, the people, the sights.\n\
  And guess what? turns out thats what i love, what i wanted to do with my life.\n\
  The force works in mysterious ways and i had to turn down my adventure to find it\
  \ out. Now i just let live surprises me."
