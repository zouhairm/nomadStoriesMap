Text: "Having lived near the beaches for a while now, I was curious about the Himalayan\
  \ mountains in northern India, and have a more personal and raw experience and not\
  \ visit commercial hill station. So an instant decision to visit a comparatively\
  \ isolated place, \u2018Kasol\u2019 made it possible. It is almost 500km from New\
  \ Delhi and the best way to travel on a budget is the overnight bus which also has\
  \ a sleeper seat option. The bus is till \u2018Bhuntar\u2019 which leads one way\
  \ to \u2018Kasol\u2019 and the other to \u2018Manali\u2019. So I took a taxi to\
  \ the rest of the way to \u2018Kasol\u2019. Its early March, so spring is almost\
  \ there and combining that with the cool Himalayan breeze at that high altitude\
  \ it was crisp and oddly comforting.\nUnlike other hill stations I had been to,\
  \ it was not crowded or loud with cars and shops everywhere. All you see is the\
  \ snow topped mountain with a river flowing along the road. Of course there were\
  \ many hotels but not the flashy kind, so I choose the one directly facing the river.\
  \ As tired as I was, I couldn\u2019t get enough of the river, and sipping \u2018\
  chai\u2019 while sitting on a rock beside the river made it worth.\nI went with\
  \ some friends and were suggested by a local to visit a popular caf\xE9, \u2018\
  Jim Morrison\u2019. Known for its deserts and \u2018Ginger honey lemon tea\u2019\
  , along with a cannabis theme, based on the farms nearby, we decided to go there\
  \ for lunch. We had to take a 250 m trek uphill to reach the caf\xE9 which made\
  \ it more appealing and the food crave worthy. \nJust before the sun would go down,\
  \ we took another trek, this time down the hill to the river to a small place, \u2018\
  Chalal\u2019. And since it was almost evening, it was getting chillier and as I\
  \ was shivering and faster heartbeats, I was told that we had to cross a river to\
  \ reach the place. Moreover the bridge that we were crossing was not only narrow\
  \ but hardly a bridge. Then it was my turn to cross and I could feel the chill going\
  \ through my body while I was shivering, but standing in the middle of the river\
  \ and watching it flow beneath your shoes made it worth all the risk\nAfter the\
  \ trek we reached an isolated place where we could sit on large rocks by the river\
  \ while we listen to soft music, coinciding with the sunset.\nWhile going back to\
  \ the hotel, I discovered a small place, \u2018Blue Moon\u2019 that served \u2018\
  nutella waffles and crepes\u2019, and couldn\u2019t resist to have more than one\
  \ serving. Then we decided to have extra large \u2018shwarmas\u2019 at an Iranian\
  \ caf\xE9 while a guy played ukele, which made a great conclusion to an unexpected\
  \ day."
