Text: "Splash, it hit my face; the water seemed rather cold, penetrating, as I felt\
  \ every nerve reach my brain. I stared at the mirror, drops trickling down my nose.\
  \ I felt numb, my brain still muddy. I rest the towel on my forehead, let the fabric\
  \ absorb. The water is gone, the dust still storming and I\u2019m staring at the\
  \ black. I opened my computer, enough I said. It was time to shut my brain off,\
  \ it was time to listen to an inner calling, it was time to breathe and let go.\n\
  The display monitor said that I had three hours for my flight to take off. \u2018\
  Namaste, Welcome to Hamburg\u2019 I heard a sweet voice as I was strolling at my\
  \ own pace.  I turned, surprised to hear an Indian greeting at an unknown place\
  \ from an unknown yet seemingly warm voice.  Her smile was captivating, and I still\
  \ remember those light blue sparkling eyes. \u2018Can I take two minutes of yours?\u2019\
  \ she asked. \u2018Sure, I have plenty of time\u2019 I said, and questioned my approach\
  \ as soon as I ended my sentence.\nIt was cold, I felt the chills; not from her\
  \ but from the lotion she was applying on my hand. While I was debating in my head\
  \ about the best way to say no, \u2018You don\u2019t have to, I\u2019m Elizabeth\
  \ by the way; let me walk you out\u2019 she said. I forced myself to get up, my\
  \ heart feeling heavy; little did I want it to end like this. I got out of the store,\
  \ she walked out with me. \u2018Bye?\u2019 I said rather reluctantly. She held my\
  \ hands, \u2018come\u2019 she said.\nWalking down the hallway, a cold sandwich in\
  \ one hand and a warm hand in the other, I looked at my watch; I had fifteen minutes\
  \ left to board my flight. In the two hours that we spent together, Elizabeth and\
  \ I had seen little but important parts of each other\u2019s worlds. It was strange\
  \ how just by holding my hand, she had taken a part of me into herself; how an unknown\
  \ person from an alien world comforted me as though she was meant to; how by not\
  \ saying anything much she had completely changed the way I would start my trip.\n\
  I got off from my flight.Elizabeth was right at the hallway, waiting for me.  I\
  \ ran to her, I wanted to hug her; give her the warmth she had given me.  My eyes\
  \ were teary; my trip to Italy had changed the way I saw life. I had forgotten what\
  \ made me happy; was lost in the rat race, had given up on my emotions. But all\
  \ of it came back to me now. We had a quick chat and a cup of coffee; I had to catch\
  \ my train back home, to Hannover. \u2018Did you bring back a part of David for\
  \ yourself?\u2019 she asked as I was fading away.\u2019 Nope, but I brought back\
  \ myself\u2019 I said."
