Text: "Mimicking a punctured garden hose, my left foot cried out in pain as I held\
  \ on to my overly bronzed human crutch, a homeless man (I later find out) --though\
  \ his fierce, musty odor never suggested otherwise! \n\nI stood there, vulnerable.\
  \ Wet. Dazed. Days into my solo adventure and a ravine --like gash was putting to\
  \ canvas what my heart was feeling.\n\n\nIt was Friday the 13th, in Puerto Viejo\
  \ de Salamanca, Costa Rica, and due to a buzzing jetlag I had arrived half an hour\
  \ too early for breakfast at the Puerto Pirata Deli and now found myself scanning\
  \ the area for help. \n\n\u201CIt\u2019s fine\u2026really, thank you.\u201D I had\
  \ muttered unconvincingly. As you do when a homeless man zealously volunteers to\
  \ run down to the pharmacy for you, expecting nothing in return- except for cash\
  \ in advance to pay for the first aid products he was going to fetch. \n\nWas I\
  \ cynical. Absolutely. \n\nSomething about his eyes hinted of a mellifluous sadness\
  \ and yet his charismatic Duchenne smile erased it all together. His aged beard,\
  \ the color of secondhand smoke, faultlessly complemented his tousled hair cascading\
  \ in waves from under his cap. Distressed blue board shorts, the single piece of\
  \ clothing he owned kissed his weathered leathery skin, a look accentuated by a\
  \ semi faded bicep tattoo. \n\nArm in arm we walked.\n\nStepping ever so lightly\
  \ on the rough, potholed Costa Rican road, a muted motion reminiscent of the good\
  \ old teenage days, I sneaked past the loose stones, fearing a false move could\
  \ somehow aggravate what I foolishly assumed was a torn artery. \n\nWe confided\
  \ our deepest secrets. He mentioned an excessive drug abuse. And his reason for\
  \ being homeless. \n\u201CNo job means no money for drugs\u201D he proudly whispered.\
  \ \n\nI confessed the reason for my trip \u2013a loved one\u2019s suicide. \n\n\u201C\
  That was your past. You are still alive. So live\u201D he breathed. \n\nSuch powerful\
  \ words. \n\nWe walked back together. \n\nThere was no sound but the comforting\
  \ song of the sea and the ethereal sway of the leaves dancing along. The peaceful\
  \ stillness was of unworldly beauty. And as I gazed at the translucent cerulean\
  \ blue between surging palm trees I could not help but smile. My foot was bandaged\
  \ and my heart was significantly lighter.\n\nI whispered farewell lingering around\
  \ just long enough to feel the dawning of an iridescent hope."
