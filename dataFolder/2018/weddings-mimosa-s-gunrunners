Text: "No matter where I go, I always search out a great place to grab a bite. So,\
  \ when I found myself in Chicago for a late summer wedding, my first priority was\
  \ to find a place for brunch the next morning. \nYou might argue that my first priority\
  \ should have been the love and happiness of the friends I had come to see be joined\
  \ in holy matrimony. To that I would ask: Have you ever had a spectacular brunch?\
  \ I got an early start the morning after the wedding; I\u2019ve never been one to\
  \ lollygag in hotel rooms when there are delicious adventures awaiting me. The night\
  \ before, I invited a friend from college, Sam, to join me in my bacon and champagne\
  \ fueled excursion. As she enjoys a good meal as much a I do, she was happy to come\
  \ and arrived at the bar before I did. \nWe sat on the patio partaking in the finer\
  \ things life had to offer, (at least those things that a $40 brunch can give you.)\
  \ Soon we notice a woman, her friend, and her young daughter sitting a few tables\
  \ away. We then watch as a tall sinewy man with dark hair made his way across the\
  \ patio, and proceeded to strike up a conversation with them. It is at this point\
  \ that we become acutely aware that this man was drunk. Not only was he drunk, he\
  \ wasn\u2019t the funny adorable Elton John after the Oscars kind of drunk. He\u2019\
  s the annoying slightly scary Kanye West at the VMA\u2019s kind of drunk. As I watched\
  \ his interaction with the ladies for a few more minutes, it became clear that his\
  \ presence was not wanted. However, there was no staff around, and this large man\
  \ with the Eastern European accent wasn\u2019t taking the hint. I take a moment\
  \ to catch the eye of one of the women, and mouth the words, \u201CDo you know him?\u201D\
  \ Her eyes open wide and she mouths back, \u201CNo.\u201D Without considering what\
  \ to do next, I make my way toward their table. I politely introduce myself the\
  \ gentleman, and he does the same. I invite him back to my table for a drink. Fifteen\
  \ minutes into our conversation he informs me that I remind him of a bouncer at\
  \ a club that he used to sell guns out of. It is at this point that I realize I\
  \ am in over my head. So I look around and notice that the ladies had left. Perfect!\
  \ No need for me to stick around anymore! Thats my que to pay my bill and leave.\
  \ Sam and I bid our new weapons dealer friend farewell, and make for our cars. As\
  \ uncomfortable as that brunch was, I can honestly say I have yet to have a more\
  \ entertaining encounter with a drunken stranger; Russian gunrunners are thoroughly\
  \ interesting people."
