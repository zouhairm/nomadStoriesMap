Text: "Although considered a bucket-list ski resort I preferred to find a more personal\
  \ connection to the village in the valley of Mont Blanc. Meeting me with open arms\
  \ the bustling farmer\u2019s market of Chamonix sprawled wide. Wandering between\
  \ endless tents under the beaming sun, breathing in fruity, floral and savory aromas\
  \ heightened my senses and exhilarated me. Food stands, handmade clothing, trinkets\
  \ and pottery highlighted the many talents of the local people.\n \u201CYou like?\
  \ I make myself.\u201D A proud craftsman from Nigeria noticed me admiring a delicately\
  \ embroidered leather purse which caught my eye.\n \u201COf course. It\u2019s beautiful.\u201D\
  \ His smile was radiant, his accent rounded, raspy and deep. He was as intrigued\
  \ by me being from America as I was of him being from Africa. We made each other\
  \ laugh politely trying to communicate and swap currency. I lingered longer than\
  \ necessary after the transaction to appreciate all his work.\n My nose took me\
  \ straight to an artisanal caviar stand showcasing every possible flavor of caviar.\
  \ The owner\u2019s big goofy smile convinced me to sample almost every flavor! He\
  \ kindly share his prized caviar and when I chose the tomato, basil and garlic flavor,\
  \ he rejoiced in song. He handed me a bag and simultaneously grabbed my hand to\
  \ dance. He spun me around and swayed back and forth while singing to me in French.\
  \ Instead of being embarrassed, I played along and laughed with him.\n Snacking\
  \ on bright red strawberries and kir, or blackberry wine, I took off exploring the\
  \ rest of the village. Chamonix is a view to behold: sparkling rivers, old wooden\
  \ bridges and gazebos, cottage buildings with chipped paint and graffiti showing\
  \ off local personalities. Murals of the mountains featured quotes: \u201CAlways\
  \ seek the difficulty, not the danger. Go forward, try, dare \u2014 in the audacity,\
  \ there is enchantment\u2026\u201D and \u201CFRESH!\u201D A nook between run down\
  \ shacks featured a smiling cartoon strawberry and lime green sun and cloud stamp\
  \ expressing \u201CWILL SHINE FOR YOU.\u201D Graffitied on a bridge pass was my\
  \ favorite - \u201CPungpinan Gangsters.\u201D\n Concluding my stay I ascended the\
  \ 3,842 meters to the top of Mont Blanc, giving me a 360-degree view. Looming over\
  \ the snowcapped mountains and blooming Chamonix, I realized this place deserves\
  \ much more recognition than simply a place to ski. In front of me hung icy white\
  \ clouds so close I could step out onto them. A lump formed in my throat and tears\
  \ built up in the corners of my eyes. I was in Heaven."
