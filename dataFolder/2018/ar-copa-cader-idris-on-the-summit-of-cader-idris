Text: "\"Wales? What the hell is in Wales?\"\n\nIt was fall break of my semester abroad.\
  \ I'd been going to school in Perugia, Italy and decided to split my 10 day vacation\
  \ between Wales and Ireland - two countries I'd dreamed about visiting since childhood.\
  \ Most of my classmates were headed to the famed Amalfi coast, a few to Germany,\
  \ and our two resident Marines to Morocco in search of camels and chaos in that\
  \ order (their words not mine). Despite that, I was deemed the oddball for my choice\
  \ of travel destinations, even more so because I would be the only member of our\
  \ class going solo. In their eyes, Ireland seemed a reasonable enough country to\
  \ visit but Wales? Of all the countries in the British Isles, poor Wales is the\
  \ most commonly overlooked. I have zero doubt that most people I know would be hard-pressed\
  \ to place it on a map - although geographical prowess is not a skill often associated\
  \ with Americans. For those still wondering, Wales is a remote, somewhat mountainous\
  \ region to the southwest of England and no, it's not its own island nor is it shaped\
  \ like a whale. \n\nA book gifted to me on my 10th Christmas ignited my passion\
  \ for the small country, and the mountain of Cader Idris in particular as it remained\
  \ a central theme in the story. I was thusly determined to summit Cader, but this\
  \ explanation fell rather short in the estimation of my classmates.\n\n\"Soooo,\
  \ you're going to climb some random mountain in Wales that no one's ever heard of\
  \ because of a book you read when you were 10?\"\n\nWell, yeah. And with that, I\
  \ packed my bags and caught a flight into Stansted, London. Upon landing, and after\
  \ a prolonged argument with an immigration officer who staunchly believed I was\
  \ trying to steal jobs from honest English citizens, I raced to my train. Out of\
  \ breath, sweating, and narrowly missing getting caught in the closing doors, I\
  \ collapsed onto the nearest open seat. My apparent disorganization drew a bevvy\
  \ of unabashed glares, which I felt wholly unnecessary. I refuse to believe they'd\
  \ never seen a flustered tourist nearly miss their train before. Then again, given\
  \ my disastrous state of being at the time, I probably would've stared too. \n\n\
  \n- I apologize but there's really no way to successfully tell this particular story\
  \ in so few an amount of characters. I tried but mincing words has never been my\
  \ strong suite so I hope you won't hold it against me that I'm cutting it off at\
  \ a rather anticlimactic spot. I'll happily finish the rest at a later date if you'd\
  \ like."
