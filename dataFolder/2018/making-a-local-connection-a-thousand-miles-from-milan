Text: "She entered the TGV and sits next to me as we leave Lausanne railway station\
  \ in Switzerland\u2013a thousand miles from Milan. The train is fully booked; the\
  \ carriage full of people. She is bronzed and tan with long fingers, stained brown.\
  \ She smells sweetly of nature and wears a thin blue and white dress. Her feet are\
  \ adorned with white sandals, worn and scuffed. Her hair is a little more than shoulder\
  \ length, long and brown, held in a head-scarf with polka-dot patterns. She has\
  \ a drawn face with high cheek-bones, an angular nose and ruby-coloured lips. She\
  \ is not beautiful, but she is attractive. We do not speak. She settles herself\
  \ into the train seat, looks past me out through the window. The countryside flashes\
  \ by at 300 kilometres per hour. \nThe conductress arrives demanding her train-ticket.\
  \ She reaches into her brown-leather-bag she has placed at her feet and says in\
  \ French, \u2018Je ne v\xE9rifie pas le ticket\u2019.\n\u2018Vous \xEAtes tenu de\
  \ par la Loi\u2019, responded the conductress.\n\u2018I\u2019m sorry!\u2019 Her\
  \ ticket is stamped, the conductress leaves shaking her head.\nShe turns to me,\
  \ \u2018Pardonne-moi. J\u2019ai d\xE9rang\xE9 vous ', she says in French. \nSince\
  \ moving to Geneva months earlier, my comprehension and fluency in French has greatly\
  \ improved, though I respond in English, \u2018I am not disturbed. They can be very\
  \ unfriendly if you don\u2019t follow the rules\u2019. \n\u2018Yes!\u2019 she puts\
  \ her ticket back into her brown-bag and sits back in the comfortable blue seat\
  \ in Carriage 5, 2nd Class section of the TGV. The Swiss vineyards roll by in a\
  \ procession of terraces.\n\u2018Have you been working in the vineyards\u2019? I\
  \ ask out of curiosity; the region is known for its wine and grape production. \u2018\
  I do not mean to presume, but you are so tanned\u2019.\n\u2018My father owns the\
  \ Esaul de Como\u2019s vineyard and I help out when he asks me\u2019, she said in\
  \ English with a strong French accent. \n\u2018You are English\u2019? she asks.\n\
  \u2018Yes! I\u2019m a banker on my way to Milan from Geneva\u2019, I respond.\n\u2018\
  Oh!\u2019 she says, \u2018and do you have work in Milano\u2019?\n\u2018My bank is\
  \ in the Uni Credit building in Milan. We have offices on the 18th Floor and our\
  \ business is directed at the wine and grape industry in Switzerland and Italy\u2019\
  , I said. \u2018We are sponsoring a conference in the Palazzo Diaz tomorrow. The\
  \ conference is about the wine industry\u2019. I added. \u2018So, I am attending\u2019\
  .\n\u2018How interesting\u2019 she says, \u2018I will speak at that conference tomorrow.\
  \ I represent my father and the wine from our vineyard Esaul de Como. I will also\
  \ report on the state of the terraces in our region\u2019."
