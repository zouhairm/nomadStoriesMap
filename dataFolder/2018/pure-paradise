Text: "Tossing bits of dried fruit over to a pair of red-legged partridges, it suddenly\
  \ dawned on me that perhaps I greatly underestimated the vast wildlife we were about\
  \ to encounter on our eight-hour hike through the mountains of Madeira. The local\
  \ guide and our new long-limbed friend, David, chuckled with my sudden influx of\
  \ inquiries concerning the danger of mountain lions and cliff jumping goats. Much\
  \ to my surprise, the only \u2018predators\u2019 to fear on this Portuguese island\
  \ located off the coast of Morocco were the hungry feral canines and felines that\
  \ roamed the domesticated neighborhoods.  \nI jumped at the opportunity for an all-day\
  \ nature hike in lieu of another day of urban exploration; however, amidst my excitement\
  \ I neglected to research what to expect from this Portuguese archipelago. As we\
  \ continued our cliff-hugging journey through the tallest peaks of this island,\
  \ I was mindfully balancing out the thoughts of \u2018how did I not consider the\
  \ wildlife?\u2019 and \u2018do NOT look down!\u2019  Tall, lush grass veiled the\
  \ hand laid steps that furrowed into the fertile mountainside which appeared hidden\
  \ from a faraway glance. The only note of caution was to not grip the slim wire\
  \ that hangs like a mere barrier between the rocky mountain side and the steep descent\
  \ down the sharp cliffs.  \nMadeira is a floating garden-like island where what\
  \ little was brought here has remained. A place where the most popular beverage,\
  \ Poncha, uses ingredients sourced from the backyards of neighbors growing sugar\
  \ cane in their own yard. The friendly and modest locals prepare seafood with inherent\
  \ skill and captivate visitors with conversation in English. I learned that the\
  \ only wildlife sustained on the island are birds and feral \u2018pets\u2019, at\
  \ least for now. Immersed in the island's flora and fauna, not only did my experience\
  \ cultivate a newfound respect for this island that dates to the ice ages, but I\
  \ didn't feel like a tourist.\nIt\u2019s moving to be in a place that still feels\
  \ untouched by human permeation of insatiability. With little to fear from non-existent\
  \ predators, it is no wonder the partridges teetering on a cliffside with us were\
  \ welcoming during our midday snack break. This pearl of the Atlantic Ocean maintains\
  \ much of its original beauty, and is truly a paradise in the purest form. It felt\
  \ as if we were the first group to hike this trail, and when we left no trace that\
  \ we had been there- I had the distinct feeling that I experienced something I never\
  \ expected to."
