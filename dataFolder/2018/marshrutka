Text: "\u201CIs this one going to Tsarkoye Selo?\u201D.\n\nI want to believe that\
  \ my effort to force a laughable Russian accent in the two last words made the difference.\
  \ Or maybe it was just the rubbishly folded paper that I took from my back pocket\
  \ and pointed to him with the words TSARKOYE SELO written in it. Anyway, the driver\
  \ nodded. I took a seat. He turned the ignition on and the marshrutka started to\
  \ tremble down the road. \n\nMarshrutki are privately owned minivans that follow\
  \ a fixed route collecting passengers anywhere along the way, mainly in Russian\
  \ suburban areas. No route map, no bus stop, no schedule. Times goes slower inside\
  \ a marshrutka. Judging by the decrepit seats and the old advertising posters that\
  \ covered its exterior I could swear that marshrutka was trembling in that same\
  \ route since the 80s. The minivan moved loudly picking up people scattered across\
  \ the countryside that violently stuck their arms out to make it stop. 40 rubles.\
  \ No matter how far you are going, still 40 rubles. Old ladies wearing aprons and\
  \ scarfs around their heads, young cadets in uniforms drinking Cola, bearded men\
  \ wearing too many coats for September. Some people had the odd privilege of entering\
  \ the diver\u2019s cubicle and seating next to him without saying a word. \n\nTsarkoye\
  \ Selo, literally \u201CTsar\u2019s Village\u201D, is located 25km south from Saint\
  \ Petersburg. After the Bolshevik Revolution, and the tsars fall, the town was officially\
  \ renamed Pushkin, to commemorate the national poet. \u201CEveryone still calls\
  \ it Tsarkoye Selo\u201D a young girl with a baby in their arms and a smile upon\
  \ her face explained to me. My lost gaze through the window during the journey probably\
  \ turned me in, so she told me \u201CCatherine Palace, next street\u201D. I stood\
  \ up, got off the van and saw her waving goodbye till I cannot see her anymore.\n\
  \  \nOn my way back, \u201CIs this one going to Saint Petersburg?\u201D, \u201C\
  Yes\u201D, 40 rubles. Few minutes later I noticed we were going in the opposite\
  \ direction. I got a bit annoyed at first but then I realized he did not lied to\
  \ me. The marshrutka was going to Saint Petersburg, indeed, after going to the end\
  \ of the route. And then it will go back again. Most of the times marshrutki are\
  \ the only source of income of a family, and the owners cannot afford to reject\
  \ passengers just because they are taking the bus at wrong side of the road. \n\n\
  I laid back and I enjoyed the ride, hoping that my flight later that day would understand\
  \ that time goes definitively slower inside a marshrutka."
