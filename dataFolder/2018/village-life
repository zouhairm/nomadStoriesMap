Text: "There's a bird in my room. \n\nLiterally.\n\nIt's hopping about from chair\
  \ to table. My bedroom, like most here, doubles as a lounge/dining room/basically\
  \ anything but a bathroom - thank god. Bird is searching for crumbs and I'm 94%\
  \ delighted she/he has waked me to enjoy sunrise.\n\nThe other six percent is exhaustion...bed\
  \ time in Morocco is after midnight and I'm an early bird. Nice to have a compadriate\
  \ to share my groggy pain. \n\nI'm staying with the Hartattouch family in the village\
  \ of Tenemel (home to the famous Tenemel Mosque) in the Atlas Mountains of Morocco.\
  \ My host and travel buddy Said (pronounced Sai-yeed) is Berber. \"an ethnic group\
  \ indigenous to North Africa.\" That is the only wiki info you'll get from me folks,\
  \ because all my knowledge of Berbers has been dropped on me by Said's family and\
  \ the fascinated locals. One very old man even taught me a word that most young\
  \ Berbers don't actually know anymore: \"\u0161merkele\". I have to write it phonetically\
  \ because written Berber has all but died out.\n\nSo with no writing (girls have\
  \ only attended school in the past ten-ish years in Tenemel), what a miraculous\
  \ feat for Said's mother (Rukaiya) and sister (Maryam), to have constructed an absolute\
  \ beast of a cake on my arrival with...wait for it...my NAME on (well \"Chikarq\"\
  , close enough). Generosity, thy name is Hartattouch. \n\nThe morning after cake-fest,\
  \ the goat gave birth. The twins now form a precious memory, and I'm gauging my\
  \ delight at 98%. Their poor mother had my other two percent with her bemused expression\
  \ at what had just happened. Poor gal. \n\nLife in the village. \n\nOne moment,\
  \ you are desperately sweeping the dust and dirt out before more blows in through\
  \ the door, which must be kept open as your light source for said sweeping.\n\n\
  After which you pop down to the stream and drink untouched crystal clear water from\
  \ your now dust-free hands, before vigorously rubbing feeling back into now icy\
  \ hands. Because here in the wilds, nature is real, balance is everything and consequence\
  \ is immediate. My skin, like that of all the locals, is now hardened with the white\
  \ dry look of cracked earth caused by washing with such cold water every day. \n\
  \nOh who am I kidding? Every three days. \n\nBut who cares? Not the goats. Whom\
  \ I watch with 98% delight - the village is bemused \"silly English girl thinks\
  \ baby goat is cute, and does not know how to skin one, what are they teaching them\
  \ over there?\"  The other two percent is now sorrow for their cute little condemned\
  \ faces."
