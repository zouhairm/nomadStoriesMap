Text: "It was a blistering hot October morning. I nervously stood at the starting\
  \ point of my trek, called Machame Gate, with my lunch box in one hand and my day\
  \ pack in my other hand. I was within a sea of hikers, ranging in age, excitedly\
  \ talking and eating lunch in their brand new, vibrantly colored hiking attire.\
  \ I was about to take-on a hike I had been dreaming of since I was a child: Mt.\
  \ Kilimanjaro. \nAs I was standing alone in the picnic area two men from Spain came\
  \ up to me. With their tree trunk sized arms bulging out of their tight-fitted shirts\
  \ they looked like they could easily bench-press me along with 300 additional pounds.\
  \ At first they were friendly but then very quickly had a change in attitude and\
  \ started asking me questions like: \"What makes you think you can do this? Do you\
  \ even eat?\" \nI responded: \"I realize I am small but I know I will make it to\
  \ the top. And to answer your other question,\" I ripped open my lunch box and stuffed\
  \ a flavorless muffin into my mouth. With my mouth very full I continued on: \"\
  yes, I do eat.\" \nFast forward to my third day of hiking and I arrived at the final\
  \ camp called Barafu at 15,331ft / 4,673m. At midnight all the other climbers and\
  \ I started our final ascent to the top. As I was relying on the tiny strobe from\
  \ my headlamp to light up a narrow path in front of me I suddenly I realized there\
  \ were two figures that were hunched over on the side of the trail. I went to ask\
  \ the guide if everything was all right and that's when it hit me: those were the\
  \ men that doubted me. Their guide made the decision that they would be taken back\
  \ down to camp immediately before their conditions worsened. \nFour hours later\
  \ and I couldn't believe it. I was standing on The Roof of Africa reading: \"Congratulations-\
  \ You are now at Uhuru Point, Tanzania 19,341ft / 5,895m.\" Enock (my guide), Elia\
  \ (a porter) and I were the first to reach the summit that day. We had gotten there\
  \ about three hours ahead of schedule and it was still dark so we decided to wait\
  \ a tiny bit longer to see if we'd get lucky and catch the sun's debut.\nAs we waited\
  \ on the summit there was a group arriving that we enthusiastically cheered on.\
  \ Their guide looked at me in total shock, and said: \"We all judged you yet you\
  \ are the strongest dada ('sister' in Swahili) of all. Rafiki (\u2018friend\u2019\
  ), you are the First Lady of Africa today!\" \nWhat a truly liberating feeling it\
  \ was to be the First Lady of Africa on October 23, 2016. It was the last thing\
  \ I expected to happen."
