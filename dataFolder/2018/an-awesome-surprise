Text: "During a trip in Australia, we went to Bruny Island, trying to catch the albinos\
  \ wallabies (which, in the end, we did not se...). Driving to the south part of\
  \ this island, we saw a wonderful isthmus. Sun was shining and reflecting on each\
  \ side of the sea, creating a mirror which got us lost about which part was sky\
  \ and which was sea...\nA little bit further, a sign marked the place of penguins'\
  \ nests. We stopped and went there, trying to catch some of them... but those funny\
  \ animals were gone fishing for the day so we decided to come back at sunset...\n\
  After establishing our tent in a base camp, we came back... Sun was getting down\
  \ in the sky while we were drinking a glass of red australian wine (they do have\
  \ some amazing ones there!!! - Barossa Valley definitely worths it!). Rainbow colors\
  \ appeared in the sky while the celestial star was disappearing, creating an amazing\
  \ color palette...\nStill waiting and still no penguins... Some other guys were\
  \ here with a red torch (normal on would blind and scare them).\nThe first little\
  \ creature (the endemic species of the island is one of the smallest in the world)\
  \ showed itself while it was almost dark night... them came a second and a third...\
  \ and dozens of them, trying to reach their nest for the night after a long day\
  \ fishing in the Tasman Sea.\nAs a serious number was coming from the beach, their\
  \ shouting could be heard miles away, and the smell could be smelt too! \n\nWe were\
  \ really excited to see those animals living their lives, but while we were watching\
  \ them, I looked up in the sky, saw the hills of the south of the island, and a\
  \ small sail was moving in the sky... my friend watched it too... suddenly we understood\
  \ what was going on... we looked each other, yelling \"aurora australis\"... the\
  \ hairs dressed up on our flesh, shivers took us, tears came to our eyes, happiness\
  \ was overwhelming us...\nThis was the last thing we expected to see in our, but\
  \ it was really here!! A green sail, moving slowly in the sky, like waves in the\
  \ Ocean... we were like kids in front of the fully furnished Christmas tree... \n\
  We totally forgot penguins and concentrated on the show in the sky, a magical moment\
  \ which last 20 to 25 minutes only...\n\nThis moment remain one of the best in my\
  \ whole life..."
