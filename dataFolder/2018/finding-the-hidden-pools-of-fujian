Text: "Jammed on a perilously thin path, 600ft high up one of the jungle-like mountains\
  \ of Wuyi, Bai and Chen (two of our group leaders) got out of the damp-smelling\
  \ 4X4 to push the car to freedom after becoming stuck on a wayward rock. The sun\
  \ was beaming, 40 degrees celsius with no form of shade to combat the ferocious\
  \ heat, yet Chen, a bulky 30-something female with scraped back, black hair being\
  \ held up by a dusty, grey baseball cap, took charge and got us going again. \"\
  W\u01D2men b\xF9 hu\xEC h\u011Bn zh\u01CEng\" she said. 'We will not be long' it\
  \ was translated to me. \n\nI was in one of three cars taking a group of travellers\
  \ on a once in a lifetime trip up a mountain that only those granted special permission\
  \ by the Chinese government were allowed to venture up. \n\n\"Very few people come\
  \ here, you are very lucky\" Bai said to me. I could barely muster more than an\
  \ agreeable groan and a practically paralysed smile as the car swept along the mountain\
  \ top, inches from the edge. I felt scared and exhilarated. \n\nThe sound reminded\
  \ me of when you learn to ride a bike. You fall off at speed and the metal frame\
  \ bashes along the floor. That was the sound of the tyres halting along the grit-like\
  \ stone path. I stepped out into the heat. The air was dry yet the evaporation of\
  \ our sweat added some much needed moisture to the air surrounding us. \nIt was\
  \ almost silent, just the slight bristle of the trees and what sounded like a stream\
  \ in the distance. It didn't feel real. 800ft up a mountain there cannot be a stream\
  \ here surely? I pondered. \n\n\"You must walk from here\" Chen told us. The group,\
  \ now led by Bai began the forty minute trek further up the mountain. The path had\
  \ become too thin for anything other than feet. My size elevens felt soaked through\
  \ with sweat, they burned with every step I took. I wrapped my brightly patterned,\
  \ cotton shirt around my head to stop the salty liquid coming from my forehead from\
  \ searing a hole in my eye. \n\nWe got to some flatland and trenched through what\
  \ looked like the Amazon, with vines and low hanging branches and greenery all around\
  \ us. Then we saw them. Huge pools of crystal clear water, embedded in a gigantic\
  \ wall of smooth and slippery mountainous rock. From 3ft to 20ft deep. I jumped\
  \ straight in. It was the last thing I expected up there. It was hidden from the\
  \ locals and in the middle of nowhere - dozens of picturesque natural pools, 1000ft\
  \ up a mountain. \n\nIt felt like the heat had simply disappeared.\n\nIt was breathtaking\
  \ - worth every drop of sweat."
