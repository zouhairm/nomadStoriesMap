Text: "Connection! With streetlight first, then road. Hard earth. Spilled blood. His\
  \ world exploded. Landmine? He knew he was alive. Pain!! Elfy first met her, in\
  \ Nha Trang. Seven bones shattered. Who said \u201Camputate\u201D? He could barely\
  \ see through tears, sweat and fear. Thrown from rented 2-stroke. Flesh flayed.\
  \ Vietnam demands sacrifice. Rice farmers were first-aiders. Firm hands soft faces.\
  \ Calm concern. Cone hats. Youngsters in baseball caps were curious, keen for fuss.\
  \ Only their parents had lived through death. A lady older than Buddha bent low,\
  \ back like Ak-47-iron from eternity tending paddies, gently wiped his brow. He\
  \ said nothing. Couldn\u2019t. Her words were nonsense, but he understood her compassion.\
  \ Millions, are KIA here. How far was home?\n\nOur cliches had been brighter. Bustling\
  \ kitchens sweating garlic and lemongrass. Fast talk in fish-sauced alleys, trading\
  \ smokes for unknowable stories. We learned rice wine, the local, fast. \u2018Space-cadet\u2019\
  \ Tom loosed his tether, disappeared. Another naive foreigner, lost to folly in\
  \ Saigon. He landed like a mortar, just as we resolved to leave, another soldier\
  \ behind, not about to miss our airlift home. He met a girl, who knows where. H.\
  \ kissed a transgender lady, first night in Bangkok. She shone in KhaoSan neon.\
  \ We laughed, gently. He stormed into his darkness, spitting, swearing, scraping\
  \ his tongue. Smashed glass. Must\u2019ve cleansed more than the kiss, that night.\
  \ Told us he was gay, weeks later. We lynched him, for having hurt himself so much\
  \ before telling us sooner. \u201CWhat goes on tour..\u201D is too painfully kept.\
  \ PTSD. Some truths don\u2019t fit back into broken bottles. I found true love,\
  \ twice. Searched for myself in over-counter distractions, drank to the freedom\
  \ of a thousand different me's. My waitress. A smile over Angel dumplings, crystal\
  \ delicacy. Drank coffee. Picked flowers. She met me uproad, lest peers think; 'prostitute'.\
  \ I wrote her, 3 times. Her twice. Incense burns out.\n\nLocals ourselves again.\
  \ Same same but different. We\u2019d taken from \u2018Nam, and she from us. Destinies\
  \ are met here, too many in blood. Nothing's new under SE Asian skies. Her cliches\
  \ burn; cycle like wearily setting-sun, soaking scorched lands seeped in Napalm\
  \ and Nirvana. Ancient witness, she's seen it all before. Elfy\u2019s was Grim -\
  \ blood, surgery and screams. Nha Trang \u2018hospital\u2019 is still at war. He\
  \ returned. Home in one battle-worn piece. Survival pre-paid to his travel insurer\
  \ in cash; better than with limb or life to the bonesaw or Reaper."
