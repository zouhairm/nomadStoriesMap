Text: "Travelling has always been an integral part of my life as I have been intrigued\
  \ by different places, since my childhood. \nSo, right after my graduation I got\
  \ this wonderful opportunity to travel to Dubai for my internship. I had no friends\
  \ or relatives staying there and it seemed a little scary before, but I still decided\
  \ to go. \nRight after landing at the Dubai international airport, I had a sense\
  \ of breathing in a different land. I could see men and women in traditional Arabic\
  \ dresses on the airport and everything seemed different. This was my first ever\
  \ trip abroad. \nI quickly booked a taxi and left for my accommodation. Little did\
  \ I know, that one room was shared by 6 people and the whole apartment by 14 people.\
  \ After which, the coming few weeks only gave me more and more cultural shocks and\
  \ made me realize that home was really far far away. \nIt was a whole new genre\
  \ that I was dealing with. I tried my hands at cooking. I was juggling with office\
  \ while using the public transport and managing to reach on time. Because home was\
  \ different. I had my personal car, a cook and my personal room. I knew that it\
  \ wasn't easy but I never knew it would be so hard. The first two-three months were\
  \ all about managing a routine. I had no sense of the time as it passed so quickly.\
  \ I wanted to give up. I missed my parents and friends. I realized the value of\
  \ my home because I used to take it for granted.\nThe broad streets, high rise buildings,\
  \ fancy cars and the UAE flag all made me feel homesick at once. I wanted to run\
  \ away to the familiar. My dreams seemed unrealistic. But, I hanged in there. And\
  \ that was the best decision ever. \nI realized how confident I had become. I was\
  \ capable of so much and I understood my true potential. I made some amazing friends\
  \ from different parts of the world. Out of which, one of the girl who was working\
  \ in communications inspired me to start writing a blog. That was undoubtedly the\
  \ best thing that had happened to me so far. Hence, I started a travel and lifestyle\
  \ blog.\n Also, coping with all the struggles gave me a clearer picture about life\
  \ and helped me connect with myself.  I started finding joy in the little things\
  \ like going to the grocery or just having a good conversation with my roommate.\
  \ And, the whole idea of staying with strangers and adjusting was pretty much an\
  \ adventure. I am a more positive and grateful person now.\nThe whole experience\
  \ just opened many doors for me and made me built a life that I am proud of today."
