Text: "I looked down at the silver-grey pool in horror and said; \u201CYou do know\
  \ I can\u2019t swim, right?\u201D\L\u201CYou won\u2019t need to.\u201D He reassured\
  \ me. \u201CNot much, anyway. Your life jacket will keep you afloat. Just stay calm\
  \ and keep the blood flowing in your limbs.\u201D\n\nHe went first to show us how\
  \ it was done; feet together, big jump to clear the rocks. I stood on the edge,\
  \ trembling with cold and fear and that rush of lucid carelessness you feel before\
  \ you do something stupid. Then I closed my eyes and jumped.\_\n\nHe had seemed\
  \ calm in his Email \u2014where he had assured me that canyoning had more to do\
  \ with a will to do it than the ability to swim\u2014 and was even calmer in person,\
  \ almost to the point of frustration. \nEvery time I had panicked, desperately gurgling\
  \ a frightful mixture of air and water, he had simply yelled at me to keep calm\
  \ and kick, until I had pulled myself together and scrambled up onto the rocks,\
  \ shaken, but exhilarated. And somehow, it had worked. \nBy the time we wriggled\
  \ out of our wetsuits at the bottom of the canyon, I felt like a cicada shedding\
  \ its old skin. \n\n\u201CHave you ever seen anything go wrong on a trip?\u201D\
  \ I asked him during lunch, wondering if I should go for the last piece of cheese\
  \ on the platter while he was distracted. I wanted to know if his laid-back style\
  \ had ever got him into trouble.\n\u201CIt happened right here, in Saxeten river.\u201D\
  \ He sat back, staring through his cigarette's twirling smoke at the deep ravine,\
  \ his mind elsewhere.\n\u201CA weather warning had been issued for that day. But\
  \ under pressure from the bosses, the guides took around forty clients out anyway.\
  \ Half of them never returned. My friend was one of the guides. There was a thunderstorm\
  \ upriver, and the flash flood it caused caught them by surprise. Nineteen people\
  \ drowned; my friend included. I was one of the first people at the scene to recover\
  \ the bodies.\u2019 \n\nHe went quiet. Was he back there, amongst the carnage and\
  \ debris, with the world he had loved turning into a nightmare? Had he, too, had\
  \ to pull himself together and face his nightmare alone?\n\u201CThat\u2019s terrible,\u201D\
  \ I mumbled. The piece of cheese sat there untouched.\n\nLater that afternoon, he\
  \ dropped us off back at our hotel. \u201CWould you still have done it, if I had\
  \ told you about that accident earlier?\u201D He asked.\n\u201CI don\u2019t know.\
  \ I guess I still would. You are a good guide.\u201D\n\u201CWell, there were no\
  \ thunderstorms up there today.\u201D He smiled a sad smile. \u201CBut you did almost\
  \ drown once or twice.\u201D \LAnd with that, the man of the Alps was gone."
