Text: "One night, I sneaked in through the wooden doors in a one-story house located\
  \ in a small town somewhere in England. As I tip toed across the kitchen trying\
  \ to be quiet, I noticed my host mum in the kitchen. She poured us each a cup of\
  \ tea and she began to tell me about her night.  \n\n\u201COh I just have to tell\
  \ you, it was a marvellous night. Peter and I went into town for a stroll. When\
  \ the rain started to pour, we ran into a caf\xE9 by the pier. There we had some\
  \ ice cream!\u201D She chuckled. \u201CI felt like I was twenty again! Ah, it was\
  \ really romantic!\u201D \n\n\u201CWas it a date?\u201D I asked jokingly. \n\nShe\
  \ answered that maybe it was and left me shocked but impressed. Here I was sitting\
  \ across from a lady that reminded me of Queen Elisabeth. Peter, her date for the\
  \ evening, was a middle age man that I had seen around the house a couple of times\
  \ but took for a dutiful relative. As if the situation wasn\u2019t scandalous enough,\
  \ she started to tell me the whole story. \n\nGrace, an 83 year old regular at the\
  \ local Anglican Church, had met Peter at a monastery that she occasionally visited.\
  \ They had become really close and he had told her his darkest secret. After 24\
  \ years as a monk, he wanted to leave the monastery. He eventually worked up the\
  \ courage to say goodbye to his brothers and left the monastery\n\n\u201CHe never\
  \ said it was because of me\u201D, she giggled, \u201Cbut I know it was.\u201D \n\
  \nOne day, I left my room in a rush. On my way to the front door, I passed Graces\
  \ bedroom and caught a glimpse inside. The door was partly open and there she was,\
  \ on the soft pink bed, cuddled up in Peter\u2019s arms, as he was reading to her.\
  \ It looked so peaceful and it made me think. Life happens all the time and we are\
  \ not the masters of faith. Things occur that are out of our control and our lives\
  \ are determined not by what happens but what we make of what happens. Grace could\
  \ have easily rejected Peter from the beginning and gone about her life as always.\
  \ Instead she took a chance on a monk and here she lies, in his arms. After three\
  \ decades of being a widower, she finally allowed herself to find companionship.\
  \ \n\nAging is not about getting closer to death. Aging is about experiencing life.\
  \ It is about the big things but also about the little things. No matter how old\
  \ we get, we should always stay adventurous and say yes to some controversy. Not\
  \ only will it spice up your life. It will also forever change some young souls\
  \ outlook on life."
