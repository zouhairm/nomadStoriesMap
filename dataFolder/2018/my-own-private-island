Text: "Something about the island of Ometepe piqued my interest, and I couldn\u2019\
  t put my finger on it. The black sand beaches were stunning, as was the lush vegetation\
  \ everywhere I looked. As I gazed out over the endless expanse of Lake Nicaragua,\
  \ which felt more like an ocean, it finally hit me: there wasn\u2019t another soul\
  \ in sight. In fact, this sparsely populated island was the most remote place I\u2019\
  d ever been.\n\nThat evening, while perusing a map in my cavernous $5 hotel room,\
  \ I was shocked to find an even smaller island nearby: Isla del Quiste. This tiny,\
  \ crescent-shaped speck of land was a half-mile offshore, not too far from my hotel.\
  \ What\u2019s more, it was uninhabited. There wasn\u2019t any information listed\
  \ in the guidebook, but I was intrigued. If a place existed that was even more remote\
  \ than Ometepe, I had to go.\n\nI asked the hotel employees about it in my broken\
  \ Spanish. No, they don\u2019t offer tours. No one ever visits, as it has nothing\
  \ to offer. I asked if I could swim there. \u201CSi,\u201D one of the more patient\
  \ clerks responded. More specifically, I asked if it was possible to swim there.\
  \ His answer inferred that it wasn\u2019t. Before I knew it, I found myself paddling\
  \ through bathtub-temperature lake water, ready for an adventure.\n\nThirty grueling\
  \ minutes later, I finally made it to Isla del Quiste\u2019s shores. The coast had\
  \ a sheer edge about three feet above the waterline, covered with thick, thorny\
  \ underbrush. It was essentially inaccessible. As I trudged through the shallow\
  \ water looking for a better access point, I got a mosquito bite. Then another.\
  \ Then several more. It dawned on me that I was the only source of flesh in the\
  \ area, and the mosquitos were having a field day. \n\nI finally found a spot to\
  \ access hard ground, only to discover that it was a lusher version of hell. Those\
  \ thorny plants were everywhere. As I slowly traversed them, barefoot, the mosquitos\
  \ got even worse. I had been on the island all of three minutes before I gave up\
  \ and retreated to the safety of the water. \n\nMy own private island wasn\u2019\
  t all I hoped it would be. As much as I wanted to explore further, it seemed foolish.\
  \ My feet and ankles were shredded, and the mosquitos had more of my blood than\
  \ I did. Besides, I needed to keep my energy to survive the swim back to Ometepe.\n\
  \nShould I ever find myself back in the region, I\u2019d love to visit Isla del\
  \ Quiste again. But not without a boat, footwear, and plenty of bug repellent."
