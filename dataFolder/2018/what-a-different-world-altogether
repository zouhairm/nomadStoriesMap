Text: "It was quite a spontaneous trip, I had no passport, nothing was planned. My\
  \ brother wanted to visit his girlfriend and my sister tagged along as well. But,\
  \ getting a passport in ten days wasn't a joke. I had to run around, go to the police\
  \ station and follow up on my speed passport. My family left before me, and I was\
  \ in my house in Delhi waiting for my passport to come. I called the post office\
  \ and they told me it will be arriving in an hour. I packed my bags, got my tickets\
  \ and headed to Bangkok.\nI was excited not just because it was my first international\
  \ trip but also because I had heard so much about the place from my brother, who\
  \ had been there numerous times. \n\nBut, he had also described to me just exactly\
  \ how I would feel as soon as I reach this foreign land. He said, \"the smell of\
  \ the place will be totally different, nothing like you have ever smelled before.\
  \ Not different in a bad way but in a strange amazing way.\" And believe it or not,\
  \ it was. I could smell the fresh seaweed, the tropical fruits as soon as I reached\
  \ the airport. \n\nThe best part about my trip since day one was that I didn't see\
  \ it like a normal tourist in Thailand, but got to experience the home food, speak\
  \ to the locals, thankfully cause of my brother's girlfriend, Eve's family. I could\
  \ never wish for anything more than that. \n\nDay one, I was exhausted from a long\
  \ flight and just wanted to eat, a lot. We had a barbeque night at Eve's parents\
  \ home, there was a variety of meat kept in front of me. Different kinds of fishes,\
  \ meats but the best of all of it were the pork. It was the most tender, non-chewy\
  \ kind of a pork I had ever eaten in my life. Nothing like we get in India. I couldn't\
  \ stop, and I'm sure the family probably took me as a glutton. But, well it didn't\
  \ matter cause I just couldn't stop eating. And that's what happened to me the whole\
  \ trip, all I did was a hog on new different kinds of food. I really didn't care\
  \ what was in front of me. I just ate it.\n\nPlease read the rest here- https://thinkingwaybeyondthelimits.wordpress.com/2018/02/28/what-a-different-world-altogether/\n\
  \nSince, I was not aware that the word limit included the space I ended up writing\
  \ a longer story and I didn't feel it would be just to leave it right there. So,\
  \ I would be grateful if you could click on to the link and view the rest of my\
  \ story!"
