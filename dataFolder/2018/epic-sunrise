Text: "As of late I have been to a total 12 countries and have travelled all across\
  \ the US.  The recent being Thailand. Thailand had always been on my heart since\
  \ I began travelling in 2008, however, the last thing I expected was that it would\
  \ be the most gratifying and rewarding country to visit and more importantly that\
  \ it would awaken the realization that I can and desire to travel for a living.\
  \  I want to share my experiences with others. I had never documented any of my\
  \ travels before but Thailand was the exception. I would wake up every morning excited\
  \ for the journey that lay ahead and to share that journey with family and friends\
  \ via social media. \nI believe the difference between Thailand and the rest of\
  \ the countries I\u2019d been to is that I really freed myself to the experience.\
  \ I experienced everything from the tourist day activities, to thrilling adventures\
  \ such as snorkling off Phi Phi Island, zip lining, to everything the night life\
  \ had to offer. \nI had been told that Thailand was a special place but i had no\
  \ idea. The first thing I discovered was the beautiful spirit of the Thai ppl. They\
  \ really live up to their mantra \u201Cthe land of smiles.\u201D Im a person who\
  \ smiles and giggles at an almost abnormal degree, so I had never felt more at home.\
  \ The hospitality of the people was another surprise, so catering and so selfless.\
  \ The fondest memory I have in fact was waking up on the beach of Phi Phi to a beautiful\
  \ sunrise. The ocean crystal blue, the sound of small rippling waves embracing the\
  \ shoreline as if too the ocean were awakening, to the sound of a couple of Thai\
  \ boys proclaiming their love for me as they too were waking up to an early morning\
  \ start in a boat and getting ready for what the day had to bring. I didnt know\
  \ how to react at first because I just wanted to spend time alone taking it all\
  \ in before the Island awoke, but then I realized, that this was the moment I long\
  \ for in travel, where you make connections-the best part of travel if you ask me.\
  \ So I engaged with them and we talked the best we could as neither of us knew the\
  \ others language very well. At one point one of the boys got off the boat, coke\
  \ and a bottled water in hand and ran up to me to offer it to me, I felt like it\
  \ couldve been an advert for a coke commercial...two human beings making a connection\
  \ via a well established brand.  I did plenty on that trip, but nothing beat that\
  \ morning."
