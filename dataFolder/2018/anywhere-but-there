Text: "\u201CDon\u2019t go there. Anywhere but there.\u201D\n\nThese are the words\
  \ of encouragement mustered by every member of my family when I told them I was\
  \ going to teach English in Fuzhou, China.\n\nFast forward a couple months, it is\
  \ a crisp December evening in a tiny apartment in the Gulou District of Fuzhou.\
  \ Gathered around the dining room table are Rachel, a sweet and kindhearted Fujian\
  \ girl who has quickly become my best friend in my new home away from home, along\
  \ with her cousins and friends. Even though we are indoors, and winter in Fuzhou\
  \ isn\u2019t nearly as frigid as my hometown of Toronto, Canada, we are all shivering\
  \ under our winter jackets trying to stay warm, as very few apartments here have\
  \ insulation. Propped at the center of the table is a boiling pot of broth sitting\
  \ atop a portable gas stove. Around it lay plates of assorted raw meats, vegetables,\
  \ and noodles, ready to be tossed into the simmering broth in a communal eating\
  \ experience called huoguo in Chinese, or \u201Chotpot\u201D.\n\nBefore we dig in\
  \ with our chopsticks, Rachel pours everyone a shot glass of beer. In China, as\
  \ with much of the \u201CEast\u201D, there is a culture of sharing that stems from\
  \ a value system of collectivism over individualism. Thus, beer is poured to share,\
  \ rather than consumed individually.\n\nShe raises a toast, to new friends and in\
  \ particular, to me, the newcomer to both their country and their family. Everyone\
  \ erupts into cheers, exclaims their \u201Cganbei!\u201D and downs their glasses.\n\
  \nAs I down my glass, I marvel internally over what a remarkably contrasting experience\
  \ this has been from what I had envisioned it to be. How can a place that many have\
  \ warned me was unsafe and full of untrustworthy, conniving people make me feel\
  \ so welcomed, so at home, and with a sense of belonging all at once? Was I perhaps\
  \ too naive and gullible, like my family had said, and fallen into a trap of trusting\
  \ people against whom I should be building walls?\n\nI decide to go with my gut.\n\
  \nIf by listening to what others had to say, but choosing not to follow, could lead\
  \ me to this place, in this moment in time, in the company of these people who I\
  \ would subsequently deem \u201Cmy family on the other side of the world\u201D,\
  \ then counterintuitively enough, I should listen more often.\n\nI should listen\
  \ when they tell me, \u201CDon\u2019t go there. Anywhere but there.\u201D\n\nBecause\
  \ those are the places I should go to."
