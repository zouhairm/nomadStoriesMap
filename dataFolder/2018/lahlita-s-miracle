Text: "\u201CI broke my toe!\u201D was my mantra while returning from my yoga class\
  \ in Mysore. I tried an Om Shanti, but ouch! Tears covered my face. I was in a lot\
  \ of pain while picturing me at the hospital with a cast and flying early back home\
  \ before completing my yoga training, my traveling, and the worst of all: without\
  \ getting any quality time with India.\nI arrived to the apartment where I was renting\
  \ a room. I was the only guest and lived with Lahlita, a woman in charged of the\
  \ cooking and the cleaning. I entered quietly; she goes to bed early, or to watch\
  \ her soap opera. I got some ice from the kitchen making sure not to step with our\
  \ \u2018ily\u2019 (mouse) and went to my room.\nI laid down on my bed and suddenly\
  \ heard: \u2018No ice ma\u2019am, no ice\u2019. It was Lahlita, wearing her green\
  \ sari, holding a little bottle of lemon oil. She pointed the oil and a blurry image\
  \ invaded me. It\u2019s like in the movies when the person speaks, but the other\
  \ one does not understand. She speaks Kannada, one of the hundreds of languages\
  \ that are spoken in India. No \u2018google translator\u2019 could help us with\
  \ that. But Lahlita and me, we understood each other, although it took a while to\
  \ warm up during each conversation. I spoke Spanish and she spoke Kannada plus some\
  \ words in English and we understood each other.\nThe day before, she explained\
  \ to me about an accident she had in a motorcycle. During the storytelling, I found\
  \ out it was not only her son with her; there were four people on the motorcycle!\
  \ She laughs at me for my reaction to that. I laughed at her reaction to my reaction.\
  \ Then we were laughing out loud for hours. Like when I discovered the \u2018ily\u2019\
  \ in the kitchen, I screamed, Lahlita laughed. Or the day a monkey assaulted our\
  \ living room, we both were in panic and then laughing.  I usually ended all this\
  \ episodes with tears in my face, but not like the tears I was talking before. \n\
  The blurry image that covered Lahlita\u2019s explanation about the oil diminishes;\
  \ I understand that she is asking permission to massage my foot. I took a deep breath\
  \ and accepted, I trusted her. Little by little she explored, and found something\
  \ crooked. \u2018See ma\u2019am\u2019, she said while massaging it very softly and\
  \ pushing it back to place. She asked me to stand up, I nodded a \u2018no way\u2019\
  , but I tried: Miracle! \n\u2018Tomorrow\u2019, she said while pointing the oil\
  \ and left. Next day I was back in yoga class, no hospital, no early flight back\
  \ home, but with a certain realization that while ago, I was already having my quality\
  \ time with India."
