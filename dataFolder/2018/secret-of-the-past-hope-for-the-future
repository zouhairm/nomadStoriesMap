Text: "My eyes rapidly blinked as I stepped off the plane; a response to the dust\
  \ that engulfed me. It was a warm day yet the sky wasn\u2019t blue. Instead it was\
  \ an ashy grey, cloudless and dull. A taxi driver leaning against his car spat on\
  \ the pavement. He caught me staring and beckoned me over. The tremendous smile\
  \ on his face reeled me in, a ray of light shining through the smog of this strange,\
  \ foreign place where I\u2019d just arrived. \n\nSurprisingly the driver spoke English\
  \ rather well, giving us both an opportunity to practice our language skills. I\
  \ decided to ask him questions in both Chinese and English throughout the ride.\
  \ At one point without much thought I asked \u201Cn\u01D0 y\u01D2u xi\u014Dng di\
  \ ji\u011B m\xE8i ma?\u201D instantly regretting the question as his kind eyes began\
  \ to water. He didn\u2019t have any siblings. His sister had died when he was 10.\
  \ Hadn\u2019t even been born yet. I looked out the window. Cars honked, traffic\
  \ weaved in and out from one another, unorderly, with disregard to the road rules.\
  \ It was chaotic. The authorities had forced his mother to abort the baby just after\
  \ she\u2019d decided on a name: Mengjie. It may have been warm outside but a chill\
  \ ran through me. I shuddered as I remembered the one child policy. \n\nMy stomach\
  \ grumbled loudly. The driver heard and pulled over at the next block of hawker\
  \ stands. Smoky aromas wafted throughout the entire strip. I bit into my jianbing,\
  \ a crepe filled with various savoury ingredients, the flavours dancing about on\
  \ my tongue. The honey chicken and fried rice, \u2018Westernised\u2019 Chinese food\
  \ I\u2019d grown to love back home, was now seemingly tasteless in comparison. \u201C\
  Jianbin!\u201D, the driver exclaimed, pointing at my chosen delicacy when he re-joined\
  \ me. He hadn\u2019t pronounced it the way the hawker had, but instead omitted the\
  \ \u2018g\u2019 at the end of the word. \u201CYou\u2019re from the south, aren\u2019\
  t you?\u201D I asked, sinking my teeth into the pocketful of flavour that was my\
  \ jianbing. \n\nAs we got back into the car, the driver lit up in delight as he\
  \ remembered something. He pulled out an object from the car\u2019s glove box. \
  \ Inside lay a gold bracelet with a jade charm affixed.  \u201CMy wife is pregnant\u201D\
  \ he beamed. \u201CWe are having a baby girl. My mother gave this to me when she\
  \ learned of the name we\u2019d chosen.\u201D He passed me the bracelet. I slowly\
  \ turned it, catching a glimpse of something. The inside was engraved \u2018Mengjie\u2019\
