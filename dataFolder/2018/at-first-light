Text: "Last year, I contracted dengue \u2013 a week of bed rest, painful itching and\
  \ painful existential thoughts. My cousin came over and tried to keep me entertained\
  \ by telling me how excited she was to go to Pondicherry with her friend that weekend.\
  \ At that moment, I can swear I felt my feet itch the most. In a mysterious twist\
  \ of fate, however, I found myself in place of my sister\u2019s friend on the flight\
  \ to Chennai. The last thing I expected was to come to Pondicherry.\n\u201CWe are\
  \ all exactly where we are meant to be. It is a highly intelligent universe we live\
  \ in,\u201D said Rekha, our Airbnb host and Odisi teacher, during the week that\
  \ we were there; solving more than just one mystery in my life. \nOn the first night,\
  \ we slept early. Sleeping in quiet places to the sound of crickets is very peaceful\u2026\
  \ until you hear a slow knocking on your window. Through the intermittent knocking,\
  \ we imagined everything from ghost to possibly insane Airbnb host. At last, we\
  \ stubbornly decided it was a woodpecker. Over the next few nights, however, we\
  \ learned to distinguish between the woodpecker\u2019s knocking and the eerie one.\
  \ On the last night, the knocking happened once; and we said goodbye to the ghost\
  \ in the silence of dawn. The last thing I expected was to encounter a local ghost\
  \ in Pondicherry\u2026 and get attached to it.\nOn the third day, we took a lift\
  \ from an old man on a bike. English was Greek to him and Tamil was Latin to us.\
  \ He might have asked us where we come from and we might have said, \u201CIt IS\
  \ too hot today.\u201D The rest of the day, we traveled in buses and made the locals\
  \ our GPS. The last thing I expected was for people in a foreign land to be able\
  \ to help us in a language we didn\u2019t understand.\nBy the middle of that week,\
  \ I had learned to co-exist with nature (read insects, unpredictable rain and spooky\
  \ animal noises), fallen in love with the palpable peace and contentment in the\
  \ people, and made plans to come live here. Listening to this, a friend said, \u201C\
  Come back to reality.\u201D On the last evening, we bumped into a father and son\
  \ duo, with faces as pink and peaceful as the evening, headed for a walk. On striking\
  \ up a conversation with them, we learned that they had left Israel five years ago\
  \ and settled here. And in that moment, their faces glowed like the setting sun,\
  \ with gratitude for having been able to change their reality\u2026 and to make\
  \ it so beautiful. The last thing I expected was to come to Pondicherry; and find\
  \ light there that would pierce through the Mumbai clouds."
