Text: "I\u2019m born on the Mediterranean coast but I love ice and cold. Olive trees\
  \ and lavender fields were my childhood but fjords, glaciers, and northern lights\
  \ were my dreams. So when a not-so-obvious opportunity arose to join a research\
  \ trip to the Baffin Island in the Canadian province of Nunavut, this was a no-brainer.\
  \ \n\nThe following spring, the research team met at the Ottawa airport to fly with\
  \ an airline specifically serving\_the Northern Territories. Unique in my travel\
  \ history, I checked in a backpack heavier than my own weight with not even a raised\
  \ eyebrow from the airline officer. I made sure to get the window seat to fully\
  \ enjoy the flight experience: the sun was shy, but the view was vivid. Sleek and\
  \ immaculate or dark and wrinkled: ice, ice, and more ice. And ice covering the\
  \ tarmac of the Iqualuit airport, which suddenly and briefly was not such a thrilling\
  \ thought. \n\nIn the bright yellow and rather communal airport - in which most\
  \ humans, dogs and not-too-big-urgent-enough items transit in and out of Nunavut\
  \ - our Inuit guide was waiting for us. Meeka\u2019s petite and slim figure was\
  \ inversely proportional to her commanding presence. \nI only later realized that\
  \ she was a dog-musher, a guide, and an activist, recognized well beyond Nunavut\
  \ or even Canada. \n\nMeeka\u2019s direct - if not blunt - style was intimidating\
  \ to our nerdy group of \xAB\_southerners\_\xBB, understood as anybody not from\
  \ the Arctic region. So I kept my mouth shut and followed her. I stayed quiet when\
  \ I was cold after hours being on the ice, when my feet were wet and freezing walking\
  \ in the tundra, and as long as possible when badly needing to pee. I obey her command\
  \ not to touch anybody\u2019s knife or pet anybody\u2019s puppies without permission.\
  \  I hold my tears when her close ones told the story of the Inuit forced settlement\
  \ and residential schooling. Meanwhile, my eyes, ears, and senses were flooded with\
  \ new experiences: the sound of qamutik sleds on the rough ice, the joy of observing\
  \ playful seals or wild geese on egg nest, the first ever taste of arctic char fish\
  \ or dried caribou meat, and the very warming effect of eating seal grease. \n\n\
  By the end of our stay, the connection with Meeka had not only grown out of mutual\
  \ respect. It also had changed something at a deeper level. This feeling remained\
  \ ill-defined until a colleague referred to Meeka as \xAB\_a real badass\_\xBB.\
  \ Indeed. She expanded my world enough to make being a female badass possible."
