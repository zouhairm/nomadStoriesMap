Text: "As quite the planner (i.e. control freak), not often do I let people make plans\
  \ for me (I'm working on it). So when I had the opportunity to go on a week long\
  \ trip to Morocco completely planned out for me, I thought heck, might as well start\
  \ now. \nRewind a few months to my first big decision. I decided to embark on a\
  \ semester abroad in Barcelona, Spain - can you say \"out of your comfort zone\"\
  ? I can honestly say that when I stepped off the plane in Barcelona, I was a mess.\
  \ After a 50 euro cab ride, an embarrassingly long cry, and an awkward conversation\
  \ with a new roommate in which she said \"no thank you\" when I asked how her flight\
  \ went, I was devastated. What the heck had I got myself into. \nHowever that day\
  \ was the lowest of lows throughout my experience abroad - it only went up from\
  \ there. Throw in a few months, a ton of new friends, 4 countries visited and way\
  \ too much money blown, there I was looking down over the continent of Africa. After\
  \ a few friends had convinced me to go on the trip, I thought okay...I don't have\
  \ a say in where I'm sleeping, what I'll be doing, what I'll be eating... ya, this\
  \ is going to be a disaster. Boy, I could not have been more wrong. My first time\
  \ outside North America and Europe was astonishing. Morocco was an amazing country\
  \ full of culture, kindness and adventure. \nMy first realization came when I was\
  \ traveling camelback through the Sahara. I'm going to repeat that because it still\
  \ blows my mind. I was CAMELback in the DESERT?? As the sun dipped below the horizon\
  \ and the skies drifted from blue, to pink, to orange, I laughed. Never had I expected\
  \ myself, a scared small town Canadian girl, to be living this life. \nI was in\
  \ the camel line behind Katrine, a Danish friend I had met along the way. Katrine\
  \ had backpacked through India, road tripped around Australia, taught in China and\
  \ interned in South Africa, all before the ripe old age of 24. (She's still, to\
  \ this day, the coolest person I've ever met). My mom once tolda friend \"Katie\
  \ wants to see the world, like, yesterday\" and that could not have rung truer in\
  \ this moment. I had a hard revaluation of my life that night under the millions\
  \ of stars in the Moroccan desert: I was going to do this for the rest of my life.\
  \ \nTo Morocco, thank you for opening my eyes beyond Europe, for bringing me amazing\
  \ friends, getting me out of my comfort zone and for a week I'll never forget."
