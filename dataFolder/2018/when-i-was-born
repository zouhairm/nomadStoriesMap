Text: "Reading about fear, I learnt the best way to overcome it is by taking it up\
  \ as a challenge. That night, I surprised myself with a ticket to Igatpuri- a small\
  \ village near the city I lived for a solo trip. Starting small was important, as\
  \ I was unaware of how many Legos I\u2019d step on in a dark room. But one thing\
  \ was sure- to explore\nI rose with the sun and within an hour found myself at the\
  \ tranquil Igatpuri station, welcoming me with cool breeze and hot tea. After having\
  \ breakfast at a local restaurant and no idea where to go, Ram- the owner of the\
  \ restaurant who was overjoyed (and surprised) on hearing that I came to explore\
  \ his village, alone, quickly recommended me a few places, as he chopped those onions.\
  \ One of them being the Bhavali Dam, I began my journey.\nIn the most crowded sharing\
  \ taxi ever, with my legs across the gear-handle besides the chauffeur, I reached\
  \ the base of the dam. As I inched closer to the dam, the sound of the falling water\
  \ became intense. With rocks walled at a steep inclination, one by one I left them\
  \ behind. They didn\u2019t seem to be content. Using their deadly weapon- layer\
  \ of dew drops to challenge my every step, they forced me to be a chimpanzee as\
  \ I couldn\u2019t help myself to climb better with my hands down on the ground.\
  \ They were successful. Why I am doing this this to myself- exerting myself to heights\
  \ just for a dam!\nI stopped, breathed\u2026 and determined to face whatever may\
  \ come and to make it to the top. The game was on!\nThe end seemed close, where\
  \ I\u2019d rest and cheer my win over the rock-army. My lungs were proving to be\
  \ too small for the hundreds of liters of air I had to take in to keep going.\n\
  Finally, I laughed quietly and teased those poor rocks. Victory was mine! The joy\
  \ of accomplishing something on your own was ever-inspiring. Celebrating and cheering\
  \ myself as I turned, my eyes saw the most beautiful scene ever. A lake guarded\
  \ by the mountains just like Draupadi protected by the five Pandavas.\nThe clouds\
  \ walked on the water as if they had taken a day off at work. The dancing water,\
  \ yet so silent and elegant, killed me by firing the sun rays which fell on it.\
  \ As my body fell into hers, she hugged me tighter than anybody and compressed my\
  \ chest to take everything I had. Pock-pop, pock-pop she sang in my ears asking\
  \ me never to go back.\nSurely, there are more beautiful sights than Bhavali- the\
  \ Swiss Alps, the Himalayan Ranges, but that moment gave me birth, which was the\
  \ last thing I expected."
