Text: "\u201CAre you ok?\u201D I yell ahead, panic in my voice. My partner and his\
  \ motorbike have just been hit by two Russian tourists on a bike of their own. Everyone\
  \ gathers themselves for a minute and realising that no one is seriously injured,\
  \ our Russian companions jump back on their bike and take off. Expletives fill the\
  \ air from both of us. The clutch of the bike has been ripped clean off the handles.\
  \ This bike is going no where fast. \nThis is our introduction to Nha Trang, a modern\
  \ coastal city roughly 400km North East of Ho Chi Minh. A resort town marketed to\
  \ the Russian vacationers, it feels more like we\u2019ve stepped into Miami during\
  \ Spring Break than South East Asia. \nAs we wheel the motorbike to a local mechanic,\
  \ we wonder if the bike will be reparable and whether we\u2019ll be able to continue\
  \ our journey to Ho Chi Minh City (formally Saigon). We\u2019ve driven nearly 1200km\
  \ from northern Hanoi and with only a few hundred kilometres left, our goal is in\
  \ sight. \nHanoi was a wonderful introduction to Vietnamese culture. Nicknamed the\
  \ Paris of Vietnam, the streets are lined with cafes serving fresh coffee and condensed\
  \ milk, baguettes stuffed with various cuts of meat, fruit vendors with baskets\
  \ on their shoulders, hoping a tourist will take the opportunity for a picture in\
  \ their iconic conical hat (guilty). \nHanoi is where I learned to ride a motorbike.\
  \ Having never driven one before, learning in Vietnamese traffic was intimidating\
  \ to say the least. Crossing the street as a pedestrian can take courage. You need\
  \ to walk cooly and calmly, but consistently. I took this same approach by bike.\
  \ White knuckled and nearly wetting myself, I managed to drive from Hanoi to C\xE1\
  t B\xE0 Island, an equally gorgeous yet significantly less expensive option to Ha\
  \ Long Bay, that first day.\nBack in Nha Trang, the bike fixed, we\u2019re ready\
  \ to hit the beach. Within literal minutes a police officer pulls us over. Having\
  \ walked the bike to the mechanic, we had forgotten our helmets in the hostel. Two\
  \ hours, a few tears, and a barter down from 2 million dong to 1 (the equivalent\
  \ of $100, an extortionate fine by Vietnamese standards), we are back on track,\
  \ again.\nNha Trang is a gentle reminder that we are not invincible while travelling.\
  \ But it is the unexpected challenges coupled with friendly locals waving at an\
  \ unfamiliar face, lush national parks, dirt roads that ribbon through the mountains\
  \ taking you higher than the clouds, that give you a full experience of Vietnam,\
  \ the beautiful and the not."
