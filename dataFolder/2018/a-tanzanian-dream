Text: "Half an hour after leaving Arusha the car turns off the road and bounces up\
  \ a dirt path in a cloud of dust. The occasional farmer hacks at the ground with\
  \ a hoe under the morning African sun, which is just coming out to play.\_It rolls\
  \ to a stop in Ngoro, a village of 4000 people that has opened its arms through\
  \ a Cultural Tourism Program. Emanuel, the program\u2019s founder, welcomes us and\
  \ explains that we will spend the day hiking and learning about the culture. With\
  \ that we set off on a trail that climbs slowly through the banana trees, coffee\
  \ plants, and rows of vegetables. We pass manure thick cow sheds, brick kilns, mamas\
  \ pounding cassava or scrubbing clothes in buckets of water; all signs of the bustling\
  \ village spread out around us. The top is a beautiful view into the valley below\
  \ and of Mount Kilimanjaro peeking through the clouds. By this time the sun is out\
  \ and we\u2019re grateful to duck into the shade. Clouds of dust float around us\
  \ with each step, and soon we are covered in a layer of brown dirt. Emanuel explains\
  \ that the short rains have not come.\nFollowing the road, we reach the village\
  \ center. Men sit around card games in the shade, while women cook over fires. It\
  \ is a wonder that such a village has survived so high up the mountain. As we watch\
  \ a Mama stroll past us with a bundle perched on top of her head, Emanuel tells\
  \ us of the issues addressed by the Village Development Fund created by the program.\
  \ It is locally-led, and the natural beauty and culture of the village is used to\
  \ support the people. \nThe promise of lunch pulls us away, and the smell floats\
  \ to us through the banana trees. First is the pumpkin soup, then fried bananas,\
  \ sweet maize and beans, beef, and fresh vegetables. It is a fantastic meal made\
  \ from ingredients grown locally, and hard to top \u2013 except Emanuel promises\
  \ us he can.\nWe follow him to coffee plants among the banana trees that give them\
  \ shade. Here he shows us how to make coffee from the picking of the beans, to the\
  \ shelling, drying, grinding, roasting, and grinding again. Each step is a new discovery.\
  \ We drink it all in until finally we can drink the product of all the hard work.\
  \ \nThere is a dark, chocolate liquid with light brown foam coating the edge of\
  \ the white china teacup which is placed in my hands. The steam rises above it,\
  \ carrying the delicious aroma of freshly roasted and ground coffee. I close my\
  \ eyes and inhale the smell before taking a sip; just like the day, it is better\
  \ than I could have imagined."
