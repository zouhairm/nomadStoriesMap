Text: "I stare out my window from a small, white cinder blocked room. I've gotten\
  \ used to laying on my hard wooden cot with the thin foam mattress, along with that\
  \ I've gotten used to the constant state of cloudiness outside my window. Sprinkles\
  \ of green from across the valley can be seen every now and then, but who wants\
  \ to see green rice fields all day when you're at the feet of some of the highest\
  \ mountains in the world? I am in the Annapurna region of Nepal during monsoon season,\
  \ to teach kids how to speak English.\n\nI was told early on when I applied for\
  \ the program that I would be in Nepal during the rainy season. \"No big deal,\"\
  \ I thought. I was there to teach kids and do something good for a group of people\
  \ who were far more underprivileged than people are here in the States. Of course,\
  \ I dreamed of seeing Annapurna and Machhapuchhare. I was forewarned by the volunteer\
  \ team in Kathmandu that I may not see any mountains at all. This, I didn't expect.\
  \ I understood it would be cloudy and rainy, but to not see a mountain at all? \"\
  No way,\" I thought.\n\nI didn't expect this much boredom. It's funny how someone\
  \ tells you the way something is and you tell them that you understand. But then\
  \ that thing happens and you are let down. I was warned of the inclement weather\
  \ and how many volunteers have battled boredom while staying in the village. But\
  \ I was determined thought that there was no way I'd get bored. Plus, this trip\
  \ wasn't about me. \nWhat a joke. Not about me? Of course, I wanted to fulfill my\
  \ fantasies of staring out at the mountains and snapping a few pictures to show\
  \ people at home.\nYet, there I was. Watching the clouds go by. Reading a book or\
  \ listening to music. Then, inevitably walking out onto the patio amongst stray\
  \ dogs and trekkers hoping to get a glimpse of the mountains too. Staring north,\
  \ into the white. \n\nDays went by like this. And I learned something. Watching\
  \ the once boring clouds and how they are in constant movement. Always changing\
  \ and going away. I started to see myself in those clouds. With this new insight,\
  \ I started to see how my dissatisfaction came and went, boredom too came and went.\
  \ And it became OK. The clouds were a type of meditation. When focused on the clouds,\
  \ I wasn't worried about what I might be missing out on. I was just there. \nOne\
  \ day I woke up a little extra early and walked out my door to meet the day. Alas,\
  \ there were the mountains. Clear as day. They were more glorious when revealed\
  \ than if they were always there."
