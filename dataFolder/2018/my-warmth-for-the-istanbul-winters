Text: "There is something so quotidian yet fulfilling about meeting people when you\
  \ travel,the locals especially.The place\u2019s routine is inseparable from the\
  \ need to learn about a place.It not only helps you learn more about the place,but\
  \ this way it becomes a part of you.You have not traveled in the sense of the term\
  \ if something in you has not shifted because of what you felt and learnt.It is\
  \ a source of knowledge and learning which is practical and unceremonious.I visited\
  \ Turkey recently and it has captured my heart eversince.Within the hustle and history\
  \ of Istanbul, I met two young men in front of the Ortakoy Cami. I wanted to ask\
  \ them about a good restaurant nearby,but both of them only spoke in Turkish.Ahmet\
  \ was quite bewildered and surprised that a strange girl is talking to him,with\
  \ Sinan,this goofy guy who wanted to help.I tried talking to them using signs and\
  \ they were amused.I acted how one eats,and they understood and told me that they\
  \ are in fact not from the city.They strengthened my belief in the goodness of Turkish\
  \ people,and it only got stronger as I traveled further to other towns and villages\
  \ in the country.I acted to them asking what do they do,showcasing how one might\
  \ work or write,and they told me they are students of journalism.They were traveling\
  \ to Istanbul for a project as Istanbul was disturbed in December 2016.They were\
  \ not scared as they wanted to see the city,which is what I felt while boarding\
  \ my flight from New Delhi two days ago.Istanbul does not become just a place for\
  \ us, but a feeling.We spoke about the beautiful Ortakoy Cami adjacent to the Bosphorus\
  \ river,with the red Bosphorous bridge attached.We also realised its similarity\
  \ with the Sultanahment Cami (Blue Mosque) and the Galata bridge.They asked me if\
  \ I am from Russia or Arab,and I only understood their question because they said\
  \ the names of the countries,to which I replied I am from India.They esclaimed with\
  \ joy, \u201COh Hindistani, Hindistani!\u201D,and spoke about Shahrukh Khan and\
  \ Bollywood songs which made me smile.We exchanged numbers and decided to go for\
  \ tea and the Dolmabahce palace together the next day.It was raining heavily so\
  \ we could only have tea the next day,and I learnt a lot about Bodrum from them.I\
  \ was glad because I did not have the time for to visit Bodrum.They told me about\
  \ its coasts,hills,greenery,people,and its historical corner.The people of Turkey\
  \ made the pace even more worth it"
