Text: "I arrived in Lisbon with no plan at hand. My tools: a small backpack, a camera\
  \ and my sense of adventure. Only time could tell what would happen on that day.\
  \ So, I began my journey.\nHaving come across a small square surrounded by small\
  \ caf\xE9s, I noticed the locals enjoyed their morning smokes, chitchat and coffee.\
  \ I noticed a group of people huddled around a fellow who was hosting a free tour,\
  \ so I made my way over. His introductory speech began with the history of Lisbon,\
  \ as he continued my eyes began to wander.\nI noticed a rather posh looking couple\
  \ taking a stroll. For some odd reason I was fixated on them until a woman, with\
  \ a scarf around her neck, appeared in my line of sight. I noticed how she began\
  \ to shadow the aristocratic couple and as my observations continued I noticed a\
  \ backpacker joined the woman. It was as if he became a shield for her. The attendant\
  \ swiftly removed her scarf and used it as a shielding mechanism for her arm. My\
  \ eyes were focused on the scene, it was so devious, so mischievous and no one around\
  \ me had taken notice of it. It was as if time stood still and I wanted to see the\
  \ scandalous result. It was utterly mesmerizing standing there in a crowd of people\
  \ who hadn\u2019t taken notice of the duo robbing the couple out in the open. The\
  \ attendant somehow hooked her scarf into the woman\u2019s purse and got a hold\
  \ of her wallet. \nI snapped. I had to stop them, regardless of how amusing I found\
  \ it, being robbed isn\u2019t fun for anyone. I left the tour and made my way over\
  \ to the duo just as they were about to open the wallet. I confronted them only\
  \ to be faced with a language barrier. The attendant and backpacker were shouting\
  \ at me, what may have been all the cuss words in the Portuguese language. I tore\
  \ the wallet from her hands I made my way rapidly to the oblivious couple. I caught\
  \ their attention and they asked about the whereabouts of the devious duo, but by\
  \ then they had already vanished. I warned the couple that purses shouldn\u2019\
  t be blatantly open and hanging from the back. They were a little embarrassed because\
  \ it\u2019s a simple rule to follow in every city. Once again, they thanked me as\
  \ we both left on our respective ways.  \nI continued my surreal expedition. From\
  \ being a voyeur to taking action, who would\u2019ve thought that I could make a\
  \ small difference? It\u2019s quite amazing to realize the things that we as humans,\
  \ whether good or bad are capable of doing. Who knows what I will come across in\
  \ my next journey."
