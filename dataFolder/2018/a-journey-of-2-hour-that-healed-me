Text: 'I have long wanted to visit the queen of Hill stations, Darjeeling, India.I
  planned to visit the tea district last November.My heart was excited to think of
  getting up at 4 am to drive from Darjeeling to Tiger Hills.I decided to take a train
  from Sealdah to reach NJP. We reached NJP station the next morning right on time
  at 7 AM.There was the usual mad rush of the crowd getting out of the train as we
  got down at the platform.We scampered out of the station and began looking for taxis
  outside.Taxi drivers were shouting names of various tourist destinations nearby.I
  boarded a taxi for Darjeeling.The cool wind slapped my face as I gazed outside the
  window of the moving taxi.I have been quite apprehensive of heights. I had not expected
  such steep roads and hilly terrain that the taxi was passing through. The car, after
  having left Siliguri, was now entering into what seemed like a never-ending steep
  roadways having deep trenches on both sides.I closed my eyes to stop these horrifying
  visions on both sides of the road and turned away from the window. Having my eyes
  closed i was trying my best to fight this impending apprehension which was forcing
  me to look down those ravines.This journey was something which pushed me to my limit
  and I came out of it with flying colors.The car had stopped for a few minutes at
  Kurseong. All the passengers of the car were stretching their bodies after the hour-long
  journey.We resumed our journey, then after 1 hour some of the people in the car
  then informed us that Darjeeling is hardly 6 km away now.There was a real chill
  in the air as we noticed our surroundings changing slowly.It seemed time had come
  to a standstill as everyone in the car feasted their eyes on the stunning beauty
  all around them.The weather was little overcast.I got to stay at Nausar hotel. Next
  morning at 4 AM I set myself for the most exciting adventure of visiting the Tiger
  Hill.The weather was clear as compared to what it was in the night.I went climbing
  the Tiger Hill and I waited there in the cold, I was waiting for the sun to rise
  and after waiting there for 60 minutes, the Sun came out in the east and it''s rays
  falling on the Tiger Hill was a reason for joy for everyone out there.In the west
  was the Kanchenjunga peak which was changing it''s shades as the sun climbed into
  the sky.

  I have been listening from childhood that Darjeeling is all about Tea,so the journey
  to Ghum was very exciting for me as it gave me the real close view of steep tea
  gardens.'
