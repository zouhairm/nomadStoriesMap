Text: "I believe that we all need to discover who we are. Not the parts that have\
  \ been shaped by our experiences and scars, but the pieces that come from stories,\
  \ places, tastes and smells. The things that resonate deep within ourselves that\
  \ make us feel at home regardless of wherever we physically are. \nBoth of my parents\
  \ were European immigrants that came to Canada in their teens. I wanted to see the\
  \ streets they walked on and places they lived myself. In the summer of 2013 I told\
  \ my parents the plan. My father went online and showed me where he grew up, he\
  \ also printed maps for me to take on the trip. \nBy the time I arrived alone in\
  \ Zagreb from Munich on an overnight train I had been travelling for just over two\
  \ weeks. Bjelovar was only a short distance from Zagreb, yet the train would take\
  \ almost two hours. After some time I opened the bag I brought to check the map\
  \ and eat some lunch. In my haste I had neglected to pack the maps my father printed\
  \ for me. Anxiety flooded over me, how could I be so careless? There was a woman\
  \ sitting across from me and we made eye contact. She smiled and I offered her a\
  \ piece of gum. She heard my accent and we started to talk. Her name was Elma and\
  \ she asked me what I was doing so I told her about my father and the map back in\
  \ Zagreb. She asked my father\u2019s last name and when I told her she freaked out,\
  \ \u201CBotincan? Your last name is Botincan? My boyfriend\u2019s last name is the\
  \ same\u201D She promised to help in any way she could. When we arrived in Bjelovar\
  \ we went to see the town map, and I tried to remember details of what my father\
  \ told me. One piece I could remember was that the street name was comprised with\
  \ two words and one started with a \u201Ck\u201D. The town map only had one two-named\
  \ street that started with an \u201CO\u201D and \u201CK\u201D. They both walked\
  \ me as far as they could before going home and wished me luck.\nI walked a few\
  \ blocks and turned down the street name I thought to have remembered, but didn\u2019\
  t recognize the homes. After experiencing some major doubt I walked around a bend\
  \ and stopped. Overwhelming emotion poured over me, and uncontrollable tears streamed\
  \ down my cheeks. The moment left me oblivious to the man with his children in the\
  \ yard that walked up to me and tried to console me. The Srdi\u0107\u2019s insisted\
  \ on inviting me into their home and they spent the night showing me the town and\
  \ relics that still stood, like the theatre, that were used during the time my father\
  \ lived there. \nIt was one of the most beautiful days of my life."
