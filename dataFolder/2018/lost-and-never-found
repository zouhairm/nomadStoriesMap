Text: "Isolated and stuck on a beach, it was sad enough to be funny. The night before\
  \ my sister, Katie, and I had pulled off the Ring Road in our tiny car to find a\
  \ quiet place to pitch our tent. We were careful pulling into the sand clearing,\
  \ and stayed clear of the soft patches, and pitched camp.\nThe next morning we drove\
  \ 1.5 hours to a hike our guidebook had recommended. I was ready, but Katie was\
  \ struggling to find her other shoe. I took it upon myself to help her and that\u2019\
  s when I realized Katie\u2019s sleeping bag was missing. So with a scream, a slam\
  \ and the turn of a key, we were speeding back to the beach. Three hours after we\
  \ had left, we were back to where we had started the day. We got out and looked\
  \ everywhere, but we came up empty handed. \nWe got into the car to leave, and that\u2019\
  s when we got stuck. We had pulled right into one of those soft spots that we had\
  \ been so cautious to avoid the night before. We tried for two hours to free the\
  \ car. We dug at the tires with our trowel, we found beach junk and wrapped the\
  \ tires with rope, propped wooden planks under the tires, and pushed, but nothing\
  \ worked. Katie eventually walked down the car track to the road to wave and beg\
  \ for help. Thankfully a Dutch father-daughter duo came to our rescue, and we ended\
  \ up lifting the car out of the sand. \nAnd so we were back on the road, five hours\
  \ behind and still without our missing possessions. After our misadventure we ended\
  \ up finishing our original plan of hiking. That was a stubborn idea, though, and\
  \ we started a 7-hour round trip hike at 4pm in the afternoon. The sun set while\
  \ we were at the summit and we hiked down in the pitch dark. To afraid to stop,\
  \ we never ate dinner until we reached the bottom at 11pm. That night, exhausted,\
  \ we slept in the car.\nThat day was not the day I had expected, but it is by far\
  \ the most memorable. I grew so much closer to my sister than I\u2019d ever been\
  \ (literally) and the sunset at the summit was by far the most beautiful I\u2019\
  ve ever seen. Turns out when things go wrong, the stories only get better, and the\
  \ memories get stronger."
