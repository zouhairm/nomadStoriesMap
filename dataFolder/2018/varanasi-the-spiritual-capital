Text: "Varanasi is one of the most ancient cities of learning. This was a place where\
  \ hundreds of enlightened beings lived at a time. In every street, you had an enlightened\
  \ being to meet\n                                                  \u2013 Sadhguru\n\
  \nA city as old as time. A city that has seen the world turn, tides change and generations\
  \ of humans born and die. Varanasi or Kashi, which has been standing the tests of\
  \ time for over 5,000 years is said to be one of the oldest inhabited cities in\
  \ the world. In Mark Twain\u2019s words, \u201CBenares is older than history, older\
  \ than tradition, older even than legend, and looks twice as old as all of them\
  \ put together.\u201D\n\nHowever, people often say that arriving in Varanasi can\
  \ be a little overwhelming. You will be greeted by chaos, colour and the feeling\
  \ of stepping back in time. Varanasi is a wonderful place to visit and I recommend\
  \ anyone who visits India to experience Varanasi if you can. If you are planning\
  \ a trip to Varanasi, here is what to expect.\n\nVaranasi is India\u2018s oldest\
  \ city, located along the banks of the famous River Ganges in the state of Uttar\
  \ Pradesh, in North East India.Varanasi is one of the world\u2019s oldest continuously\
  \ inhabited cities and is dripping in history and spirituality. It is one of the\
  \ seven Hindu and Janist holy cities, or Sapta Puri, in India. Buddhism is said\
  \ to have been founded in Varanasi as well.\n\nVaranasi is a spiritual city, where\
  \ Hindus go to pray, wash away their sins and honour their dead on the banks of\
  \ the Ganges. Dying in Varanasi is seen as auspicious, as it ends the cycle of rebirth.\n\
  \nA trip to the Ganges will reveal countless sights that will remain with you long\
  \ after you leave.\n\nWhat draws millions of pilgrims from all over the world to\
  \ the city of Varanasi is the fact that it is one of the holiest of the seven sacred\
  \ cities in Hinduism. Called the spiritual capital of India, this magnificent city\
  \ of learning radiates endless energy. Despite being witness to ancient civilizations\
  \ come and go over centuries, Varanasi is still alive, unabashedly colourful, vibrant,\
  \ and wonderfully rich in history and legends. \nA boat ride across the sacred Ganges,\
  \ perfectly captures the spirit of Varanasi. Countless candlelit paper boats with\
  \ flowers carrying people\u2019s prayers, float their way across the waters. Countless\
  \ pilgrims take a holy dip in the waters, others meditate in solitude and the rest\
  \ bow their heads in prayer along the Ghats.\nSimply, It's heaven on Earth."
