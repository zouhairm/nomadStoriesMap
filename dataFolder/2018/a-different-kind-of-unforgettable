Text: "It is a milestone age, 25, and I was looking for my next adventure. I had always\
  \ admired Thailand for its captivating temples and diverse culture. I began my research\
  \ and discovered that the Full Moon Party, landed on my 25th birthday. Does it get\
  \ much better than that? I took it as a sign, and booked a ticket. \n\nIt was almost\
  \ midnight in Thailand, and a party in my celebration had exacerbated some illness\
  \ I had been having. Just before it became my birthday, some fellow travellers lifted\
  \ me on to the counter at the hostel. As they counted down the last second, everyone\
  \ began singing \u2018Happy Birthday\u2019. Although some of them not knowing who\
  \ I was or even my name, when backpacking, everyone becomes family. If you are a\
  \ traveller you know the feeling of every individual being a semblance of home;\
  \ because in travel, everyone is finding themselves, everyone is lost and for that\
  \ reason, no one really feels lost at all.\n\nAs everyone was heading to the party,\
  \ I caught a glimpse of my friend and knew, the only place I was headed was emergency.\
  \ I hopped on the back of a motorcycle. As we sped down the streets of Thailand,\
  \ headed in the opposite direction of the party, my mind went blank. In that moment,\
  \ the only thing I felt was anxiety and the wind whipping around my neck as we sped\
  \ onward.\n\nWhen I arrived, I was handed a stack of paperwork. In the state I was\
  \ in, panicked and somewhat intoxicated (hey, it was my birthday after all) the\
  \ whole situation seemed like a mass blur of confusion and panic. \n\nThe next day,\
  \ my friend came to visit but, sunglasses still on, she fell asleep in no time.\
  \ My only source of entertainment, and she fell asleep? So, in her slumber, and\
  \ in my hospital gown, I proceeded to take videos, narrating our two vastly different\
  \ travel experiences at the time. Moments in to what was sure to be a documented\
  \ piece of hilarity, I looked over to see the door open, and the lights extinguished.\
  \ \n\nInstantly, I thought the worst, \u2018this is it, I am never leaving this\
  \ place\u2019. Moments later, the entire hospital staff, entered my room carrying\
  \ a lit birthday cake and began to sing. That is a moment to cherish, that is one\
  \ of those unforgettable life moments.\n\n My journey through the Thailand healthcare\
  \ system is the last thing I expected when I set out to experience my 25th birthday\
  \ in the most memorable way possible. But, it turns out it was undeniably memorable.\
  \ Just in a different way. And I would not change a thing."
