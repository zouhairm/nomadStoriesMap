Text: "We were hiking along the north coast of county Mayo from Ballycastle to Portacloy,\
  \ camping as we went. We walked along rolling hills of green which were populated\
  \ by sheep and separated at their bases by thick pools of bog, the remnants of which\
  \ were caked on my hiking boots. The views, from cliffs of dizzying heights, were\
  \ spectacular and punctuated by promontories that jutted out into the wild Atlantic.\
  \ We only encountered rain a few times that week, a stroke of good luck in the west\
  \ of Ireland. \n\nAbout halfway into the trek, with my companion far ahead of me,\
  \ I encountered a local farmer at the top of a hill. Across the valley, on the upward\
  \ slope of the next hill, a flock of sheep were being herded by a border collie.\
  \ The dog stopped and looked towards the man, who let out a loud whistle. The dog\
  \ responded by racing uphill to herd additional sheep.\n\nI\u2019d never seen a\
  \ working dog before. I asked the man how he had trained the dog. In a thick accent,\
  \ he downplayed his own role. Border collies are quick learners and eager to please;\
  \ they want to work, he assured me. We joked how unlike humans they were. He wore\
  \ a flat cap and leaned on his walking stick. He was probably in his seventies.\
  \ He asked me where I was from and where I had travelled thus far. When I mentioned\
  \ Dublin, he nodded. Dublin seemed to have a magnetic pull for people under a certain\
  \ age, he told me. The young people had all left the area, there was nothing here\
  \ for them anymore. He would sell his farm in a few years to some agri-business\
  \ firm. He had already been propositioned. His family didn\u2019t want to be bothered\
  \ with the farm, they only needed the money. Who could blame them, he said. Times\
  \ are changing. \n\nThe dog sat on the ground again and the man let out a specific\
  \ whistle. The straggler sheep, regardless of how obstinate they wanted to be, would\
  \ sooner or later be herded into the flock. The sky was overcast, but the man assured\
  \ me there would be no rain. He could tell by the sheep scattered across the hill.\
  \ If rain was coming, they\u2019d group together under cover. \n\nI left him after\
  \ a while, continuing on with my hike. It wasn\u2019t just the land here that invoked\
  \ an unsettled nostalgia, it was the people. How could I mourn a lifestyle that\
  \ I too would probably leave for the city? I walked up the hill and the border collie\
  \ came to inspect me as if to inquire if I should be corralled as well. I heard\
  \ the whistle in the distance and the dog left me alone and returned to his work."
