Text: "The young Tibetan knows no English. He speaks to me with nods, gestures and\
  \ smiles. He points at my boots. I peer dubiously along the rocky path that runs\
  \ above a blue, alpine lake. More Tibetans, the man\u2019s family, hobble barefoot\
  \ over the stones, faces taut in pained concentration. I look back in uncertainty.\
  \ He sits, fingers pulling at his laces, happily surveying the land ahead.\nPrayer\
  \ flags flutter rainbow colors in the frigid air, decorating every outcrop. Mt Chenresig\u2019\
  s 6032m peak looms over the valleys of the Yading Nature Reserve, Sichuan Province,\
  \ China. The mountain is a shape-shifter, gazing down with a new face every time\
  \ it comes into view. My altitude is 4500m, so high that anything beyond a slow\
  \ walk leaves me breathless. \nI came to Yading oblivious to its significance, surprised\
  \ to find myself climbing steep gullies and rocky ridges beside parents, children\
  \ and old women leaning on sticks. Kora is a spiritual practice in Tibetan Buddhism,\
  \ during which pilgrims walk any number of clockwise circles around a sacred object,\
  \ building or geographical site. The more grueling a Kora, the more religious favor\
  \ is gained. Each year, Tibetan families walk thirty kilometers around the holy\
  \ Mt Chenresig, enduring the long, lake-side stretch barefoot for extra spiritual\
  \ merit. I didn\u2019t know this when I began the Kora. Only through a stranger\u2019\
  s wish to share, do I learn.\nUnder my companion\u2019s approving gaze, I remove\
  \ my shoes. The path is sharp and unforgiving and he winces with every step, his\
  \ legs bowed unnaturally. My soles are tough after years of barefoot coastal living.\
  \ I stop and wait; we are in this together. I encourage him with a cheer, a wave.\
  \ When he sees me, his pain is forgotten. A broad grin consumes his face; pride\
  \ at his own performance, joy in sharing this small part of his culture.\n\u201C\
  Ho!\u201D He cries, giving me the universal sign of approval: the thumbs-up.\n\u201C\
  Yew!\u201D I cheer.\n\u201CHo!\u201D\nSoon, the stones are biting my feet. My friend\u2019\
  s support becomes crucial, just as mine is to him. We propel each other with cheers\
  \ and laughter, his smile my companion through every tender step. At the end, I\
  \ press my hands together in thanks. He continues his Kora without ceremony, just\
  \ a nod, a wave, his constant grin, understanding that I have no words to truly\
  \ express my gratitude at his willingness to share. \nAs I tie my boots, I gaze\
  \ at Mt Chenresig with new appreciation. I came here a tourist, but leave enlightened,\
  \ my lessons taught in a language of smiles."
