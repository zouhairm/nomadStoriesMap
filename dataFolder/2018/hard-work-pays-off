Text: "Lagos, Portugal is a fantastic town brimming with local culture, cuisine, and\
  \ quirks. There was plenty to see and do in the town itself, however the area is\
  \ famous for its rich network of coastal caves and secret beaches eroded by the\
  \ Atlantic sea of the years. \n\nThe only way to reach these mysterious places is\
  \ via a small boat or kayak. We booked our trip with one of the dockside stalls\
  \ selling trips out to the caves. We were told to meet at the dock for 12pm the\
  \ next day.\n\nArriving after being fully fed from one of the beautiful dockside\
  \ restaraunts, we departed on a small boat which had just enough room for 15 people\
  \ plus around 10 two man kayaks. We all enjoyed the pleasant trip out of the town\
  \ and onto open water, taking in the beautiful views of Lagos itself and the surrounding\
  \ scenery.\n\nThe journey lasts 20 minutes, then the boat pulls up near to the cliffs\
  \ and after a brief introduction, we clamber into our kayaks and slip off of the\
  \ back of the boat and onto the water. With the group fully loaded, our tour guide\
  \ leads the way and we begin to forge our path through the ocean waters. Instantly\
  \ I thought that the encroaching views must be special as the Atlantic ocean is\
  \ not easy on the back and shoulders when you are paddling against it!\n\nAt this\
  \ point, I could see people being turned off as the kayaks did require a lot of\
  \ strength to power through the water. Luckily, the boat stays as close to the group\
  \ as it can without coming too close to the cliffs, so that help is never too far.\n\
  \nPaddling for ten minutes, we turn a corner and my breath catches as I take in\
  \ the splendour of the cliffs. The bright yellows and oranges of those cliffs were\
  \ stunning. The local guide pointed out some of the more \"famous\" cliffsides,\
  \ where you can see certain shapes or animals within the formations if you look\
  \ closely enough.\n\nI had thought the cliffs beautiful, and was delighted when\
  \ I felt that my trip, and hard work kayaking, was worth it. What I hadn't expected,\
  \ was how the caves would outshine everything I had seen in Lagos thus far. The\
  \ caves were a shimmering mirage of colour. Deep blues and rich greens that, until\
  \ that moment, I didn't believe actually existed in the natural world. I saw colours\
  \ in the water of those caves that I have not seen the likes of anywhere else on\
  \ my travels.\n\nIf I thought that Lagos contained such beauty before I had arrived,\
  \ I would have forced all of my friends and family to cone with me, just for the\
  \ majesty of that kayak trip."
