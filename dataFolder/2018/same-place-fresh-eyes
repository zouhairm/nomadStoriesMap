Text: "\u2018Well, people die through the year, so that helps business when it\u2019\
  s off-season\u2019, my boatman explained. I chuckled - whether you are dead or alive,\
  \ Varanasi will welcome you with open arms. \n\nYou visit Varanasi to find moksha\
  \ - eternal peace. My journey had been less than peaceful. I arrived at 2 in the\
  \ morning, on a train that was late by 22 hours. My phone doesn\u2019t have the\
  \ best reception, and the hotel isn\u2019t returning my calls. I shoo away stray\
  \ dogs, jump over garbage and cow-dung to find my hotel. It would make more sense\
  \ to find another hotel, but I persist. If my budgets go out of hand, it\u2019ll\
  \ affect my next trip. Plus I\u2019ve already paid for the hotel. Eventually I find\
  \ the hotel that metaphorically shut its doors on me. \n\n\nFinding a balance between\
  \ expenses and experiences is hard when you\u2019re on the road, but my friends\
  \ make it seem easy. They max their Credit Cards. Ask their parents to pitch in.\
  \ Some even quit jobs to travel. And, while I admire their passion, they also make\
  \ me envious. I hail from a modest middle-class family. I have been financially\
  \ independent since I was 20. If I ask parents to fund my trip to the Everest, they\
  \ would ask me to climb a mountain closer to home. I want to travel often, but I\
  \ don\u2019t have deep pockets.\n\nThe sun shines brightly on the bank of River\
  \ Ganga. The local passengers on a ferry next to me barely look up from their mobiles.\
  \ Barbers, priests, hawkers, and pilgrims start arriving at the riverbank. A portrait\
  \ of peace and quiet transforms into a carnival of colours and chaos. Each shrine\
  \ on the riverbank is doing its own round of morning prayers. It feels like I\u2019\
  m in the middle of a very badly organised music festival. A peddler even tries to\
  \ sell me some pot. \n\nVaranasi is now as noisy as a Mumbai railway station. I\
  \ feel I\u2019ve arrived at a destination when it begins to feel like home. I realise\
  \ travel isn\u2019t about seeing new places across the world. It\u2019s about seeing\
  \ the world with new eyes. Back home, I have a tedious 3-hour commute, but I tooI\
  \ barely look up from my Kindle or phone. I too am a passenger on a ferry ignoring\
  \ the sunshine.\n\n I decide then and there to travel even when I am at home.To\
  \ novel in the routine. To observe how humans interact with each other, and their\
  \ surroundings.  I know now that I\u2019ll travel\u2026 Even when I commute to work."
