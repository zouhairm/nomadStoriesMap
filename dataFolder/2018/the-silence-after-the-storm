Text: "The sun was setting down, lost in the rhythmic amalgamation of colors. I sat\
  \ on the bench capturing the moment through my eyes, hearing the leaves whispering\
  \ to the wind. \n\nThe place was still, peaceful exactly what I wanted at the moment.\
  \ Silhouettes of birds flew across the sky darkening the walls giving it an eerie\
  \ feeling. I searched around, not many people were present and the ones that were\
  \ were already leaving.\n\nA woman caught my concern, \"You okay?\" I asked.\n\n\
  She looked startled, she was not expecting someone at this hour I suppose.\n  \n\
  She gave a weak smile and we began talking. This 'bagh' wasn't so gloomy always,\
  \ she said. Almost a century ago, this place was buzzing with celebrations, that\
  \ day was Baisakhi -the main Sikh festival when the massacre occurred. Coming from\
  \ outside the city, many people were unaware of the imposition of the martial law.\n\
  \n\" While the people were enjoying the festivity, all the five entrances and exit\
  \ were blocked and the British Indian army were ordered to fire for ten minutes.\
  \ Nearly all the people present died and the wounded were not given any treatment.\
  \ My grandfather was among them. \" Her voice broke.\n\nShe was looking at the holes\
  \ on the wall that spoke about the atrocity of that night while she relayed the\
  \ story. \n\n\" When my family came to know about it, my grandmother rushed to search\
  \ for her husband irrespective of the curfew. On reaching, the scene that unfolded\
  \ in front of her shook her to soul. Everywhere her eyes went, dead bodies were\
  \ scattered. I recall she told me, 'Not a grain of soil was left which was not tinted\
  \ with blood. All I could hear were the cries of the people in agony. They were\
  \ crying for death. All the green was turned to red.' \" \n\n\" She stayed all night\
  \ in the pool of blood, breathing the air pierced with pain near her husband's dead\
  \ body, watching one by one the cries losing their battle of life. Until next morning\
  \ when her friends came to get them. When she was on her death bed that night was\
  \ fresh in her memories. Even after sixty years she could not forget the horror\
  \ of that night. \" \n\nWhen she finished, I wasn't able to seep the knowledge.\
  \ I could not imagine the fraction of what they must have felt that night and how\
  \ much they suffered. I left her with her thoughts.\n\nIt's a place of secrets,\
  \ one that has seen too much and concealed too much to be at peace with itself.\
  \ It is the silence after the storm. I have read these lines some where but it was\
  \ now that I fully understand them."
