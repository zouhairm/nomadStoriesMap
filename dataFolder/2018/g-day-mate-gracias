Text: "An exploration into not just the medicinal benefits of Yerba Mate, but the\
  \ mental and social impact such a ritual has. \nExploring cultural patterns within\
  \ Europe, I found a recurring theme that connects nearly every culture around the\
  \ world regardless of space and time. The importance of the Ritual of food almost\
  \ always overtakes the importance of sustenance and the food itself. If it's absinth\
  \ in France, Pintxos in Spain or filling a sake cup past the brim in Japan, Yerba\
  \ Mate is a link in a very important chain. One that can break the need for language\
  \ itself and connect two seemingly different dots. \n\nMy journey throughout 2 years\
  \ in Europe was to find these little nuences in not just cultures, but specific\
  \ regions (sub cultures?) within a country. Between food and connecting with people\
  \ I am unsure which is of more a passion. I realised very early in my journey these\
  \ two combined, and were alot more powerful than first expected.\n\nHanded to me\
  \ In a single cup, Metal straw and steaming hot tincure of medicinal and grassy\
  \ notes, I not only get taken back to who I met while enjoying Yerba Mate, but am\
  \ reminded to be present, in the moment and 'pass' on my energy for another to gain.\
  \ Feelings of group and togetherness and connection to those around. \nAfter all\
  \ we're not alone in this world. \n\nThere are very few rituals like it, and yet\
  \ they are everywhere without realising it. Coffee and brunch in Melbourne? Espresso,\
  \ Green wine and Cherry liqueur in Portugal; Tapas, Pintxos and Sherry in Spain.\
  \ The list could be endless. But what's behind all these rituals? Togetherness,\
  \ human connection, a feeling of place and time in the world, a reason to get mildly\
  \ (or insatiably intoxicated?)\nThese rituals and their being are almost more important\
  \ that the food itself. With them food is always good and always provides us with\
  \ enough love and energy to resist any snack that falls in our path.\nWe could just\
  \ reduce food to numbers and words, like protein, carbohydrate and lipids and take\
  \ a pill to skip these rituals? It would need far less people to share, waste far\
  \ less time and we'd live a lovely lonely life until well into our 100's.\n\nIn\
  \ returning from my travels, I have been reminded time again of just how important\
  \ the small rituals are in our lives. Letting go isn't easy. But understanding comes\
  \ from all flavours."
