Text: "The air felt heavy but the beauty was overwhelming. While driving through desert\
  \ roads trying to cross from Serengeti to Ngorongoro National Park, only interrupted\
  \ by the wild animals passing by, our safari driver asked the most unexpected question:\
  \ would you like to visit a Maasai village? When we heard the engine stop under\
  \ the shadow of a centenarian baobab the only English-speaker in the tribe was waiting\
  \ for us. \nIn the twinkling of an eye, we were surrounded by a crowd of beautiful\
  \ people dressed in colorful fabrics who were jumping around us and putting necklaces\
  \ on our throats. It's their welcome dance and they invited us to participate. The\
  \ energy of that moment can't be described, you should really experience it!\nRight\
  \ after this warm welcome, they invited us to come inside the village, where they\
  \ showed us the handicrafts and jewelry they make and how they live. They invited\
  \ us into their houses, made out of hay and animal feces (no worries, it doesn't\
  \ smell once it's dry) and explained us many facts about their way of life and traditions,\
  \ remaining happy to answer any questions we (the amazed white foreigners) may have.\n\
  They build their tiny, dark houses with one bed for the dad and one for the mum\
  \ and children. They use cow leather as matresses and keep some space right in the\
  \ middle to cook. Their diet is based in proteins: they kill animals to eat their\
  \ meat, drink their milk and they make medicines and unguents with their blood (I\
  \ guess now you understand whey they have those perfect bodies and how they can\
  \ compete with lions for food). They never visit hospitals , they basically hardly\
  \ ever leave the village. \nThey take decisions in assemblies, where women and men\
  \ vote equally and in a peaceful manner. Their children run free around the village.\
  \ There is a school set up right outside it but it seems more an attraction for\
  \ the tourists to put some coins in than a real school. When some boy from the tribe\
  \ seems really brilliant, they allow them to continue their studies and send them\
  \ to the city so they can continue attend some courses at Univeristy, that's how\
  \ we got to communicate with the only one of them (a young, smiley boy in his twenties)\
  \ who could speak English. They normally only speak Maasai language, not even Swahili.\
  \ \nWe were sad to say goodbye and amazed by how there are still ways to stay out\
  \ of this modern society full of connections. They really know how to live in a\
  \ simple, pure way and are thankful for the things they have."
