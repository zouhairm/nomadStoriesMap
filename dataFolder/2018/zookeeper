Text: "\u201CThey call me Zookeeper,\u201D he said, as we piled into his pickup, heading\
  \ east out of New Orleans. We had been waiting on the shoulder of the highway for\
  \ hours,  sweaty and exhausted, having tramped across miles of the city to get there,\
  \ fuming, sniping at each other, ready to get the hell out of town.\n\nWhoever said\
  \ New Orleans was a romantic place never tried hitchhiking out of there on a summer\u2019\
  s afternoon in the 21st century. Cities are always hard for hitchhikers. But this\
  \ was something else altogether. The swamp had gotten into us and didn\u2019t want\
  \ to let go. \n\nZookeeper picked us up because he saw our guitar, or \u201Cgee-tar\u201D\
  , as he called it. \u201CHoo-ee,\u201D he said. \u201CY\u2019all are going to New\
  \ York? Bet the next time I see ya, it\u2019ll be on American Idol!\u201D\n\nHe\
  \ was 50ish, hair a blonde pompadour-mullet combination, and his tattooed back burnt\
  \ red-brick from working on the railway. \u201CMy friend is goin\u2019 to Mississippi\
  \ in a few hours,\u201D he said, \u201Chow \u2018bout I give you a ride to my camp,\
  \ and you can play me a song. Then he\u2019ll pick ya up on his way home.\u201D\
  \ We didn\u2019t know what a camp was, but a song seemed a reasonable price for\
  \ a ride\u2026and we did want to meet his 18-foot gator named Uncle Buck (whom he\
  \ claimed was the reason he was called Zookeeper). Mostly, we just wanted to get\
  \ out of town. \n\nWhen we arrived at Zookeeper\u2019s camp, a house on stilts in\
  \ the Bayou, he told us he wasn\u2019t ready for a song. \u201CNot yet,\u201D he\
  \ said, climbing into his motorboat. \u201CI think we should go crabbin\u2019 instead.\
  \ But don\u2019t worry. I think my friend will be along soon.\u201D Now, we were\
  \ really along for the ride. We began motoring, as Zookeeper opened his cooler and\
  \ started downing Busch Lights. Cigarette in one hand and beer in the other, he\
  \ drove the boat with his feet. Ten Busch Lights later he stopped and said \u201C\
  think I\u2019m gonna take a swim,\u201D and dove right into the water. No sign of\
  \ Uncle Buck, though. No sign of his friend, either, as the sun slowly began to\
  \ set. \n\n\"Shit,\" our eyes said to each other, \"I think we might have been kidnapped.\"\
  \n\nHis friend eventually did come, and, yes, we did finally play Zookeeper a song.\
  \ But we didn't make it further east until the next morning. Fearful of what a highway\
  \ in Mississippi might be like in total darkness, we trepidatiously accepted his\
  \ offer to stay the night. I slept on the porch, figuring my chances were better\
  \ with Uncle Buck than Zookeeper to watch out for. \n\nKidnapping aside, there's\
  \ no night like one out on the Bayou, with the frogs singing you too sleep."
