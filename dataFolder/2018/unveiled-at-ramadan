Text: "Dozens of villagers were crammed into the small room we waited in, while others\
  \ peeked in through the doorway. They watched me with intent faces. I pushed my\
  \ hand up against my chest to ensure it was still resting under my blouse. The secret\
  \ I concealed hung around my neck like a millstone weighing on my shoulders. I don\u2019\
  t know why I chose to wear it. I desperately wanted to know these people and relate\
  \ to them. But I feared if they knew what I was, they would reject me entirely.\
  \ \nI was served a plate that held a thick, russet-colored sauce on a bed of long\
  \ pearly white grain. An aromatic scent rose from the plate and pierced my nostrils\
  \ as I prepared to taste the village delicacy. Suddenly, I noticed there was not\
  \ a utensil in sight and realized I was expected to eat with my hands.\nHesitantly,\
  \ I attempted to form the food into a ball that I could pick up. Struggling to hold\
  \ it, I lifted my hand above my head and sloppily dropped the food into my mouth.\
  \ The whole room burst into laughter while I too chuckled as sauce dripped down\
  \ my mouth. My first sloppy bite gave everyone the go to eat as well. \nNaseema,\
  \ a student in my preschool class, jumped into my lap and began playing with my\
  \ hair as she usually did. Distracted by the chatter, I failed to realize that Naseema\
  \ discovered the secret under my shirt. \u201CAamma,\u201D she called to her mother\
  \ in Konkani. Naseema held up the Magen David hanging around my neck to show her\
  \ mother. \nThe room fell silent and I felt a surge of panic run through my body\
  \ like a lightning bolt. I was caught! My secret was revealed. The fear I felt was\
  \ paralyzing. Slowly, I looked up towards the woman in an orange sari. Her eyes\
  \ reflected the silver star she stared at as the ocean blue stone in the middle\
  \ of the star was reflected in her pupil. She crawled to me and grabbed the star\
  \ from Naseema\u2019s hand. I held my breath as she studied it meticulously. She\
  \ looked up at me and said, \u201Cbeautiful.\u201D \nIn the past, I hid the influence\
  \ of my ancestry upon my identity. I assimilated myself to feel accepted by others.\
  \ I feared that sharing my history would cause others to reject me. But for the\
  \ first time I was unveiled in front of a crowd. A Jewish girl in a crowd of Muslims.\
  \ Historically, the relationship between my people and their people has entailed\
  \ great strife. But on that day at Eid al-Fitr there was not strife but acceptance.\
  \ I will always remember the unveiling at Ramadan that led me to discover the beauty\
  \ of authenticity."
