Text: "Back in 2015 I went on a life changing trip around Europe with an unexpected\
  \ group of individuals. Half, including myself, nerds from Ohio, the other half\
  \ stoners from Alaska. The trip began in Rome, Italy. Everyone was confused and\
  \ nervous to be exploring a foreign country alone with strangers.  So obviously\
  \ when nervous in a foreign country, just find the most attractive English speaker\
  \ you can and start embarrassing yourself, which is exactly what I did. \nIt didn't\
  \ start off too rough in my humble opinion, but ten minutes into our first conversation\
  \ I got a cigarette ashed on me for asking in Spanish how many stairs were in the\
  \ Spanish Steps. Sadly, I was unaware that just because the steps were called the\
  \ Spanish Steps didn't mean people spoke Spanish in Rome. This might have been an\
  \ oman for some, but I'm no pessimist. Some how this was met with the playful laughter\
  \ of my reefer from Alaska, followed by, \"That was fucking hilarious, I wish I\
  \ had the guts to do that.\" So, we continued, roaming Rome making awkward conversation\
  \ I can still remember to this day. \nAs if the cigarette ashes that stained my\
  \ shirt weren't enough, the most embarrassing part of the day was yet to come. Since\
  \ it was a hot summer day, myself and my lady were feeling like indulging in some\
  \ of Rome's famous gelato. We went to the nearest gelato stand and it turned out\
  \ she was too indecisive to order, so me being the smart ass I am in an attempt\
  \ to impress her, I ordered the one flavor that wasn't in english, Viagra.\nShe\
  \ caught my mistake in time to request for her cone to be a different flavor, but\
  \ the first cone was already scooped. I wasn't about to buy a second gelato out\
  \ of fear of getting as hard as Mount Everest, so I enjoyed the gelato anyways.\
  \ It didn't taste half bad, but an hour went buy and I started to feel something.\
  \ Whatever this feeling was startled me enough to use the little roaming data I\
  \ had to look into the Viagra gelato I consumed. Turns out it was made of a combination\
  \ of African herbs, that have a similar effect to viagra, which left me with this\
  \ awkward half boner the rest of the day. \nI never thought anything would come\
  \ of pairing with her to walk the streets of Rome, especially after the Viagra incident,\
  \ but some how we were inseperable for the remaining two weeks of the trip around\
  \ the heart of Europe. Now we hardly speak, which is ashame. As the old adage says,\
  \ \"If you love something set it free and if it was meant to be it will come back\
  \ to you.\""
