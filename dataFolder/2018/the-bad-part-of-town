Text: "As a student of design, Paris - and Europe in general - was idealized in my\
  \ mind as an art and history paradise, oozing sophistication. So, hoping to soak\
  \ up as much culture as possible, I took a whirlwind summer gap month and trekked,\
  \ with my brother, over as much of Europe as I could. When we reached Paris as a\
  \ couple of novice backpacking tourists, our expectations were as high as the Tour\
  \ Eiffel. \nIn the opulent City of Lights every hostel we found was full, so we\
  \ jumped off the train at a Parisian suburb called Noisy le Sec to stay at a cheap\
  \ hotel. This is when we met Pascal. \nWe huddled at the train station, bewildered,\
  \ reading a paper map. He had short salt and pepper hair, curious and friendly gray\
  \ eyes, and leathery skin that made him appear outdoorsy. \"You two look lost,\"\
  \ he said in a melodic accent. \"This isn't a very good part of town.\" He then\
  \ described Noisy le Sec's reputation as the most violent district around Paris.\
  \ Concerned for our safety, our new friend Pascal suggested: \"you can stay with\
  \ me and my family\". \nHe drove us not far from the hotel to his row home in a\
  \ brick-and-ivy-laden alleyway. Our room was a sunny, pitched loft painted white.\
  \ \nWe awoke the next morning to the scent of fresh baguettes, bought that morning\
  \ from the local la boulangerie. My memory of those baguettes will forever be nothing\
  \ short of pure joy. Then Pascal casually mentioned his neighborhood's annual picnic.\n\
  The picnic started at noon and ended after midnight. Each neighbor brought their\
  \ dining tables, chairs, and best utensils and lined them up gloriously down the\
  \ middle of the long, narrow alleyway; creating something like a Mad Hatter's tea\
  \ party, although much more congenial.\nEveryone meandered into the alley not with\
  \ bags of potato chips and Miller Lite, as we were accustomed; but with homemade\
  \ pies, tarte tatin, duck, elaborate salads, and, let's not forget; oodles of wine\
  \ and spirits. The procession seemed endless: a sauntering flurry of warm kisses\
  \ on the cheek, aromas of fresh, pungent foods; and beautiful French syllables flowing\
  \ from each dialogue. It was magnificent.\nAnd as the day came to a close, everyone\
  \ was sitting down, leaning back; sipping wine, lingering on a cigar, all amidst\
  \ the rise and fall of chatter. \nYes, we did see the Tour Eiffel, the Centre Pompidou,\
  \ the Arc de Triomphe. They were all monumental. But, with the proper guide, I discovered\
  \ some of the best culture can be enjoyed even in the bad part of town."
