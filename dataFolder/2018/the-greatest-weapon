Text: "\u201CThe next five hours will be a glitch in our lives,\u201D Miguel said,\
  \ as he held the steering wheel with one arm.\n\nAnd he hovered closely as he talked\
  \ to me, a man in his late 60\u2019s who danced with bold English words amidst a\
  \ thick foreign accent.\n\nWe were strangers, but friends for this moment of time.\
  \ \n\nAnd one by one he confessed his secrets to me. \n\nAs though he had been holding\
  \ onto them tightly like a child holding a balloon, suspenseful of what would happen\
  \ if he were to have let them go. \n\nI was the perfect candidate; a solo traveller\
  \ on my own, wandering through a land of unfamiliar faces.\n\nWhen he stopped to\
  \ ask for advice, I somehow knew the answer he needed. \n\nFor my words had become\
  \ his own voice and I was repeating them back into himself.\n\nWe talked as he drove\
  \ through the roads of beat up towns, full of fenceless houses and polluted streets\
  \ with burning rubble. \n\nHalfway to our destination, we paused in our tracks at\
  \ his favorite restaurant. \n\nA beautiful wooden house hidden between two mountains.\n\
  \n\u201CThis place has the best tamales in all of Guatemala!\u201D Miguel announced\
  \ proudly, as he ordered for the both of us.\n\nHe was right. \n\nThe flavors burst\
  \ with energy inside of my mouth, the taste of spicy chili amongst soft black beans.\n\
  \n\u201CYou look like old friends,\u201D I said as the waiter walked away.\n\n\u201C\
  Yes, very long time,\u201D Miguel nodded in reply. \u201CHe is one of the Mayan\
  \ ancestors.\u201D\n\nI felt a shiver through my body as the atmosphere around me\
  \ changed.\n\nAnd like a photographic memoir, the bloodshed war that once teared\
  \ down their walls flashed before me. \n\nIt was as though I could feel what they\
  \ had felt, the betrayal of humanity. \n\nOf a generation stolen, in an attempt\
  \ to be forgotten. \n\nYou will never be forgotten.\n\nAnd despite their brave faces\
  \ the people lived in fear. Wondering if it would ever happen again. \n\nThey allowed\
  \ foreigners into their country as a means for survival, for money. But to them,\
  \ everyone was an intruder and they just wanted to live in peace. \n\nFor it was\
  \ not even a decade ago that they were murdered by their own people.\n\nAnd even\
  \ though I was surrounded with locals who held this terror in their minds, everyone\
  \ still smiled at me. \n\nIt was a smile of peace, a smile of hope. \n\nIn the whispers\
  \ of the smile we shared warmth between strangers. \n\nIt was a symbol of connection,\
  \ a reminder of love.\n\nBut above all, their smile was a weapon, a way to build\
  \ allies, their only hope of preventing such corruption again."
