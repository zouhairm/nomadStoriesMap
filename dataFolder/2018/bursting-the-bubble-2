Text: "Everyone told me this is the best discotheque in the Peruvian Amazonia, so\
  \ here I am. They were offering me shots from bottles with little snakes at the\
  \ bottom, but the colorful lights were intoxicating enough.\n\nI sat next to the\
  \ DJ\u2019s cabin because I wanted to ask him about a couple of songs he played.\
  \ He came out of the cabin and I noticed he is in a wheelchair and missing both\
  \ legs.\n\nI approached him, and he immediately asked me if I am from Lima. Locals\
  \ can easily identify people from the capital. I like to think is because of the\
  \ accent but is most probably because of our clueless outfits. His name was Alonso.\
  \ I kept talking to Alonso because his good mood was contagious.\n\nHe told me with\
  \ a proud expression about his time of service for the army. He had to fight at\
  \ VRAEM, an area infested of narco-terrorists. I thought it was funny how he felt\
  \ the need of explaining to me what is VRAEM. He assumed I didn\u2019t know because\
  \ I am from Lima.\n\nI knew about VRAEM very well because I did my internship in\
  \ the Military Hospital. However, a lot of people from Lima believe terrorism ended\
  \ in 1992 after capturing the Shining Path\u2019s leader. Or maybe we just turned\
  \ a blind eye toward a conflict that no longer affected us directly.\n\nWe live\
  \ in the same country, yet we live in different worlds.\n\nAlonso decided to enroll\
  \ at the army because he wanted to fight for his country.\n\nHis childhood memories\
  \ were tinted with blood. He couldn\u2019t forget how his neighbors were taken out\
  \ of their house and executed within seconds. He told me about his best friend who\
  \ was kidnapped in front of him. Alonso\u2019s family moved to another village after\
  \ terrorists murdered his uncle.\n\nWhen he was fighting at VRAEM, he got two shots\
  \ on his back. The bullets brought other complications and both legs had to be amputated.\n\
  \nOne of Alonso\u2019s friend interrupted our conversation for taking a selfie.\
  \ A few more people joined us, so we got shots from a bottle with a snake at the\
  \ bottom. We continued our night laughing, apart from the world we were talking\
  \ about five minutes ago.\n\nA couple of days later I returned home. Same routine,\
  \ but something was different. It is impossible for Alonso to forget what is going\
  \ on every day in the jungle in the conflict against narco-terrorists. He made me\
  \ not want to forget either.\n\nBursting our bubble is so uncomfortable. However,\
  \ how can we not listen the deafening sound of the rifle in the jungle? Staying\
  \ aware and educate is the only way to not let history repeat."
