Text: "Focused on freedom and tolerance, Berlin is a very alternative city, an international\
  \ space where diversity is more the rule than the exception. This is most true in\
  \ the district of Friedrichshain on the East block; known as home to the few Squat\
  \ projects left in the city. Graffiti about anarchism decorate the buildings, signs\
  \ about political meetings and people walking around in ripped dark clothes and\
  \ extravagant hair styles.\n\n \u201CSquatting is very much home to me,\u201D he\
  \ said, his blue eyes shining with excitement.\n\nJoey had introduced me to squatting,\
  \ a brand new concept to me. \u201CPeople occupy empty houses,\u201D he had said,\
  \ \u201Cit started, as we know it, around the 60\u2019s with a bunch of hippies\
  \ looking for a place to live, although it has become more rebellious with time.\
  \ In Berlin, after the Wall fell, many squats were formed by left-winged people.\
  \ This one included.\u201D\n\nWe were sitting in the bar on the ground floor of\
  \ Liebigstrasse 34. Every Tuesday, people of the squat house host what they call\
  \ a \u201CVoK\xFC\u201D (people\u2019s kitchen) to anyone who wants to enjoy a meal\
  \ at a very low price.  In the room, the noise of people chatting animatedly melted\
  \ with the melodic guitar of David Gilmour. The light was scarce and multiple signs\
  \ and graffiti urged for tolerance and rebellion, like a constant reminder that\
  \ it was punk territory. \n\nAs I asked him, \u201CWhy do you like it so much?\u201D\
  , one of the squatters came out of the kitchen juggling multiple plates of stew\
  \ and started serving them for free to everyone. \n\n\u201CSquatting is about supporting\
  \ people that are oppressed, basically. Bringing people together in a city where\
  \ everyone is on their own\u201D.  Joey had told me how growing up he had been very\
  \ much alone. He had squatted his first time as young as twelve, and it had become\
  \ a lifestyle to him ever since. \u201CLook around. You are surrounded by people\
  \ that just accept each other.\u201D\n\nAnd he was right, the people I saw, were\
  \ a mixture of colors and personalities, travellers and locals alike; a cocktail\
  \ of characters hard to find concentrated in any other place, yet they all seemed\
  \ to belong.  Help was provided where needed and faces, that on the outside world\
  \ seemed so hostile, were relaxed and animated. Suddenly,  I understood it. People\
  \ sat together to share a meal here, with different nationalities, subcultures,\
  \ backgrounds and stories. No questions asked, no criticism present. They had formed\
  \ in this place an open space for all kinds of people to gather, a safe haven to\
  \ be oneself."
