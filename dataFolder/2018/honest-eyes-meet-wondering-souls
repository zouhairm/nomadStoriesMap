Text: "Stepping onto the dusty tarmac heat waves surrounded my peripheral view as\
  \ I admired my unfamiliar surroundings. The heat from the sandy North African climate\
  \ baked on my skin as I embraced the smell of the fresh yet polluted air. Instantly\
  \ silenced by the sounds of roaring engines, the desert heat sparked an instant\
  \ urge to discover and explore the ambience. With the heat blaring from the atmospheric\
  \ tangerine sun, it wasn\u2019t long before I was cherishing the historic city of\
  \ Sousse, witnessing their white sandy beaches in their mesmerizing prime. 140 kilometres\
  \ to the South of Tunisia\u2019s capital, Sousse is a city full of hospitality and\
  \ generosity. Admiring the streets of Avenue Teh\xEDb Tehiri, devouring fresh Tunisian\
  \ delicacies and making friends with the local dogs, I came across an angelic man\
  \ named Salah. A City where the young underestimate sleep and the old never age,\
  \ I unsurprisingly spent my first 72 hours under the graceful arms of my new Tunisian\
  \ friend. With nothing but life in front of us we played African drums in the clubs\
  \ of Port El Kantaoui, visited the black market to buy forbidden alcohol and went\
  \ fishing with friends under the piercing moonlight on the now infamous beach called\
  \ Boujaafer. The diversity of the city encouraged many daytime activities; jet skiing\
  \ along the Mediterranean waves, paragliding through the scorching North African\
  \ sky and as if planned, appreciating nature by silently watching the alluring sun\
  \ set and rise. The marble floors, shutter windows and traditional Tunisian food;\
  \ Kefta and Couscous added the conventional ambience and complimented Salah\u2019\
  s home in a majestic way. Whilst relishing dishes I consciously wondered how this\
  \ kind hearted human had crossed my path. His eyes told me all I needed to know,\
  \ the true beauty behind this Country. Amongst the struggles and pain, through to\
  \ battles and fights, I knew I had met a proud yet strong individual. Astonishingly,\
  \ Tunisians don\u2019t have much materialistic belongings, though they always give\
  \ no matter how little. The catastrophic calamity that  shook the Country left grief\
  \ stricken individuals around the world. The history of Sousse dates right back\
  \ to the 11th Century, as does hard work and serenity. A Land where connections\
  \ grow and spirits run free, Tunisia is more than the eyes are exposed to. The food;\
  \ the people, the culture, the language and the atmosphere, is apart of it all.\
  \  It is a place where aligned auras find self-happiness alongside unexpected journeys."
