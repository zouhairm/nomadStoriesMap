Text: "Alan\u2019s eyes are on me, not to harm, but to guide.\n\n\u201CMaam, what\
  \ would you like to see? We have caves, a boulder beach and a floating village\u2026\
  \u201D\n\nIn the Philippines, a young, married woman travelling alone is almost\
  \ unheard of. Even rarer is for her to go caving deep in Mindanao with strange men.\
  \ \n\n\u201CKuya (Big Brother), I\u2019m alone. Is that the final price?\u201D I\
  \ negotiate with Alan seconds before making up my mind that I could trust his kind\
  \ eyes.\n\nWe are in Surigao City, a town at the Northeastern tip of Mindanao. Virtually\
  \ no one comes here as a tourist. The first time I met Alan, he was standing in\
  \ front of the hotel lobby, wearing casual shorts and t-shirt. For $28, he\u2019\
  ll drive me all day to see Surigao City\u2019s landmarks.\n\nWe head to Silop Cave,\
  \ a 12-system cave so big that it will take three days to see everything. Alan spoke\
  \ in Surigaonon dialect, negotiating with two guides for their services. Before\
  \ entering the first cave, the four of us bowed our heads to pray for safety. \n\
  \n\u201CWe are only visitors here, and our wish is to come out OK,\u201D Alan translated\
  \ to me. Inside, we came five feet away from two grey snakes, coiled, and ready\
  \ to attack. Virgin-white stalactites glistened like diamonds as if serenading us\
  \ to touch it.\n\nSurigao was once so rich with nickel deposits, they believed it\
  \ was one of the world\u2019s biggest sources. In the Day-asan Floating Village,\
  \ I confirmed the news I see on TV \u2013 miners are taking away large chunks of\
  \ land, so painfully obvious at the next bald island. Where are the giant ships\
  \ off to \u2013 China or Japan? No one really knows.\n\nAn hour later, Alan asks\
  \ Julito, our fisherman guide where we could find lunch. \u201CIn my house,\u201D\
  \ he replies. Julito\u2019s wooden home was on stilts, perched in a shallow part\
  \ of the ocean. Around us, almost every house looks the same: one bedroom, one living\
  \ room and tiny kitchen at the back. \u201COur bathroom is the ocean water because\
  \ it just gets washed it away,\u201D Julito says to me because I kept looking around\
  \ for the restroom. Hundreds of locals live in this floating village, dependent\
  \ on the ocean\u2019s moods to keep them fed, safe and alive. \n\nJulito served\
  \ us saang, a local shellfish, together with salt and hot white rice. I look outside\
  \ at the late afternoon shadows reflecting on the water. Alan chats away with our\
  \ host, calling the wife in the kitchen to join us. Alan\u2019s eyes caught mine,\
  \ and I take an appreciative smile at how our day turned out. Soon it\u2019s time\
  \ to say goodbye."
