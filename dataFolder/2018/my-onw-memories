Text: 'It''s funny how life is constantly changing, and how much the plans we''ve
  made for our lives change. I lived my whole life in a small town, I never thought
  I would get out of there, visit other places, meet other cultures and create my
  own stories.

  One day my life changed completely, on my 16th birthday, I won a trip to New York
  and then to Chile, for the first time I could see how life works, I was alone knowing
  places that I never imagined, my soul was smiling I never felt so full of life,
  every bit, every corner of the places I met, so many people with so many life,  I
  met two brothers who came from China to work and send money to his family so that
  his sister could study. Its so good when the lives of so different people from yours
  can make so much change inside you, traveling was like living 60 years in 20 days,
  . I felt like a bird who came out of the cage and was seeing the world for the first
  time

  Inside me there is a very great desire to see the world, a world completely different
  from what I see from my bedroom window, that''s what motivates me, makes my heart
  beat stronger and makes my blood run through my veins'
