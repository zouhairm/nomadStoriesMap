Text: "After graduating, I, like many other fresh university graduates were looking\
  \ for the answer to the question \u201Cwhat should I do with my life?\u201D Further\
  \ education or a new career was the debate with blurred visions of our future aspirations.\
  \ With this uncertainty, I needed to take time to explore and put myself in a position\
  \ of vulnerability in hopes of confirming my future goals. Mindfully, I booked a\
  \ ticket to what is said to be one of the toughest places to travel, which also\
  \ happens to be where my family is from, India.\nBorn and raised in Canada from\
  \ Indian immigrant parents, I was curious about India. \_All I knew about India\
  \ came from 3 main sources; my mom\u2019s childhood stories, relatives who recently\
  \ visited, and of course, Bollywood movies! I needed to explore the curiosities\
  \ I had of my family\u2019s heritage and confirm my understanding and conclusions\
  \ of India.\nFinally, it was time for my 3 month long journey in India. \_As I sat\
  \ down in my seat, the anxiety kicked in with numerous doubts running through my\
  \ head; can I handle the poverty? Will I get scammed? Will people accept me being\
  \ an Indian living outside of the country, sounding and dressing different? Is 3\
  \ months too long? How will I communicate? Will I be able to get around safe? Is\
  \ traveling alone a good idea? \nAfter 20 hours of travel time, I finally arrived\
  \ at the Mumbai. I hailed a cab and within 2 minutes into the ride I started to\
  \ quickly rethink my decision as I realized Mumbai was not as glamorous as Bollywood\
  \ movies. \_The pollution made me jump to conclusions, but I promised myself to\
  \ keep an open mind. I couldn\u2019t turn back and thankfully, I didn\u2019t. The\
  \ cab exited the highway and as I looked out the window at the masses of people\
  \ eating on the street corners, shopping in colourful markets, and kids filled with\
  \ laughter, I started to appreciate the organized chaos, looking forward to what\
  \ was to come.\nThe next 3 months I experienced culture shock in every region visited.\
  \ The slums took a toll on my conscious, I deciphered different languages while\
  \ trying to act like a local to avoid scams, and traveled in uncomfortable sleeper\
  \ buses at odd times. \_It was the last thing I expected, but the challenges I faced\
  \ were what made this trip a success. \_With every vulnerable situation, I was rewarded\
  \ with a beautiful view, a greater lesson, or a better understanding of my heritage.\
  \ Being uncomfortable made me realize how resilient we can be, allowing me to plan\
  \ my future without holding back."
