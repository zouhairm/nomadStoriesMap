Text: "When I first saw him, I couldn\u2019t believe what I was seeing, a visibly\
  \ elderly man with a cane on the bus for the day trip to the Plain of Jars, Laos.\
  \ In  my two months in South East Asia, I hadn\u2019t met a  traveller who was near\
  \ that  advanced in age (Later he told me he 86!).  He asked me about myself.  I\
  \ think I was also a surprise to him.  I had seen so few black travellers on my\
  \ trip and I was now getting used to that initial start people would give when they\
  \ first met me. \n\nHe smiled when I told him I was from Zimbabwe and asked after\
  \ our (then) infamous president. Something about him made me overcame my natural\
  \ shyness.  Over the next few hours as we discovered the mystery of the  Jars and\
  \ wondered about their origin, as we shook our heads at the fact that there were\
  \ still live landmines from the Vietnam War all over the Laotian countryside, we\
  \ learnt more about each other. He was from America, Eugene, Oregon. I was pretty\
  \ proud of myself for travelling solo all the way from Zimbabwe to South East Asia\
  \ but he gave me travelling goals.  Neil (that was his name) had been everywhere\
  \ or so it seemed. My new friend had bicycled around the world and passed through\
  \ my own country. We sat next to each other at lunch, on the bus trip back to Phonsavan\
  \  and at dinner that evening. I. When I told him about scary the trip has been\
  \ for me, he told me he was proud of me.  He gave me his contact details and invited\
  \ me to write to him.  Months later, safely back home. I wrote my first letter to\
  \ him. He replied. We have been writing ever since.  We often use snail mail since\
  \ Neil doesn\u2019t have a cell phone or a computer.   I got married and had a son.\
  \  I sent photos and used Skype sometimes. These days I still write snail mail letters\
  \ but I also use the phone more a lot because Neil\u2019s health and eyesight is\
  \ failing and writing letters is becoming more difficult. But the best was two years\
  \ ago when on trip to Ethiopia with his son, Neil (all 89 years of him) took a detour\
  \ and came to visit me and my family in Harare. It was a testament to how our love\
  \ and friendship had grown through those long letters we write to each other.  Maybe\
  \ because of his age, and because I know he is safe place for me, I trust him more\
  \ and can be real with him.He has become my confidant.  And I often marvel at it\
  \ and at what made him give me his contact details.  The last thing I expected was\
  \ that in Laos of all places, I would meet one of the great loves of my life.  He\
  \ is that to me."
