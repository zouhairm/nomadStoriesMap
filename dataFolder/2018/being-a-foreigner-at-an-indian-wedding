Text: "\u201CNever ask such questions on an Indian wedding\u201D, the groomsman was\
  \ uncompromising and refused to let us ask the family about the dowry. What should\
  \ we do? At the school of journalism we had a graduation project about the place\
  \ of women in the Indian society. Our story was supposed to be a high point in the\
  \ documentary.\n\u201CThat\u2019s a dead case. Let\u2019s call our supervisor and\
  \ say that we failed\u201D said my classmate. He was desperate. We traveled at night\
  \ and haven\u2019t slept for almost two days, the locals didn\u2019t understand\
  \ who we are and what we were doing in the village, the Indian heat and hot food\
  \ made us sick. \nLuckily the signal in the village was bad and we didn\u2019t succeed\
  \ to talk to our French professor who was in Pune with other students. I suggested\
  \ trying once again. Not with the groomsman whom we knew from Pune university, but\
  \ with the groom himself.\nIt was not an easy task, because the newlywed was surrounded\
  \ by guests and the family of his farther-in-law. Every hour there was another ritual\
  \ for the young couple: the haldi ceremony of applying yellow paste, the lightening\
  \ of the fire agni, tying the knot\u2026 \nFinally, here is the groom standing by\
  \ his own. I should catch the moment and talk to him. I tell him how glad I am to\
  \ be on this beautiful ceremony and how much I was impressed by their love story.\
  \ Love story? Shh\u2026 Nobody should hear that it isn\u2019t an arranged marriage,\
  \ only the closest relatives and friends are aware. Let\u2019s talk in an empty\
  \ room, behind the closed doors, suggests the groom. \nAlleluia! We talked on camera\
  \ late at night for about an hour. He tells us that they met in college and fell\
  \ in love, but her farther chose someone else for her to marry. He said he would\
  \ do his best to become the best husband for his daughter, so the father asked him\
  \ to prove that he was worth his daughter. He left to Pune to do his Master degree\
  \ in a prestigious university and then found a good job in the city. He said that\
  \ he refused a dowry, though for most of the Indians it is still important to show\
  \ that there is some, as well as it is important for the marriage to be arranged\
  \ because love marriage, this \u201Cwestern fashion\u201D leads only to divorce\u2026\
  \ Well, at least interview is done!\nSecond day of the wedding ceremony. We are\
  \ presented as honor guests. We struggle with the camera to make it work on the\
  \ Indian heat. We manage. We have a long way back to Pune. Tired, but happy."
