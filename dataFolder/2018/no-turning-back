Text: "The monk happily pointed towards the rear of the dilapidated monastery and\
  \ said \u201Cstraight, straight\u201D.\nI passed the small school room where two\
  \ young monks had entered hand in hand and heard them chanting mantras, the only\
  \ noise up here in the mountains other than birds and insects.\nThe path split just\
  \ after Hongri Gompa with a trail leading slightly down towards a building or slightly\
  \ up towards forest. Which of these constituted \u201Cstraight, straight\u201D,\
  \ I wondered.\nGuessing that down was only access to the house I went up but the\
  \ seed of doubt was sown.\nAfter about half an hour and the path splitting on two\
  \ more occasions I was directing through intuition.\nThe path went through overgrown\
  \ sections, the stones became slippery and there was no sign of the next village\
  \ or indeed any life whatsoever. \nI started to wonder what would happen if I twisted\
  \ my ankle out here in the remote mountains of West Sikkim. Would I try to return\
  \ to the Monks at Hongri or continue on towards the village of Tashiding?\nIt was\
  \ as these thoughts were whirling in my head that suddenly time stopped, my purple\
  \ hat was floating in the air in front of me as my body fell towards the right,\
  \ my foot giving way on a wet rock. The next few seconds are a blur of motion and\
  \ impact. A thud as my backpack containing two fleecy jumpers buffered my initial\
  \ fall and I bounced. Then a tumbling through undergrowth, desperately grasping\
  \ whatever roots were around and clinging to anything solid I could reach.\nWhen\
  \ I came to a stop my back was aching, a shoe had almost come off and I had bloody\
  \ scratches all up my right arm. Winded and in shock I lay there and shouted for\
  \ help. There was no-one in the overgrown valley and after a few minutes I realised\
  \ this was up to me. \nBelow the bushes that I was tangled up in was another drop\
  \ but to see how far would mean leaning over. I pulled my shoe on and then clambered\
  \ up the side of the cliff to where my hat was sitting in the middle of the path,\
  \ just waiting for me to retrieve it.\nSo here the decision came true. I decided\
  \ to continue and each step was agonising as my back reacted to impact.\nReaching\
  \ the homestay some four hours later was a blessed relief but I thought I might\
  \ not be able to move the next day. Thankfully a friend was able to help me to the\
  \ health centre where I was given painkillers but it was only on reaching a hospital\
  \ a week later that I had an x-ray and discovered a compression fracture in one\
  \ of my lumbar vertebra."
