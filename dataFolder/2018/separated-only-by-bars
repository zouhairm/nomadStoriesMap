Text: "I shuffled into a shadowy corner near the stone fortress in the bay of Old\
  \ Havana with a small wad of Cuban pesos in my hand. For the third time I ignored\
  \ the warnings and foolishly exchanged money in the streets.\n\nAmerican banks don\u2019\
  t do business in Cuba so my cash was all I had, but between mojitos and street food\
  \ I\u2019d rapidly burned through it. My salvation was an emergency reserve of US\
  \ dollars to exchange at a government run Cadeca, but it was Sunday and the banks\
  \ were closed.\n\nHavana was alive with nostalgia and I wanted a fix so I conjured\
  \ up some coin and cruised the Malec\xF3n, a roadway along the coast, in the back\
  \ seat of a teal 1957 Chevy Bel Air convertible. The fact remained I was out of\
  \ money. My driver agreed to exchange my dollars for pesos, and with the bolt of\
  \ doubt that slashed through my gut I surrendered my last $100 on good faith they\
  \ would be legitimate.  \n\nSequestered in a corner I held my breath and a bill\
  \ up to the sky to prove that humanity was good. A figure rapidly approached me\
  \ from behind the iron bars of the fortress as cars belched by and I coughed on\
  \ fear and exhaust smoke.\n\nA man in a black bomber jacket faced me through the\
  \ bars and reached for the bill as I saw my hopes of getting home dissipate into\
  \ the blur of the Caribbean sun. He took the bill and held it up where the light\
  \ illuminated the watermark, which could be copied on fake bills, and said to look\
  \ for the metal strip instead. \n\n\u201CIt\u2019s real,\u201D he said, flicking\
  \ ash from his cigarette. He handed back the bill and his security badge came into\
  \ focus. \u201CYou need to put those away.\"\n\nWhen I stuffed them into my purse\
  \ I scraped the wall and fragments of the forgotten fortress fell to my feet along\
  \ with my doubt. Minutes were lost to hours as we discussed dictatorship, his former\
  \ leader and my newly appointed one. We exchanged opinions about the tumultuous\
  \ affairs of our mother countries and speculated about when they would finally forgive\
  \ one another.\n\nWe stood there with different realities, separated only by bars,\
  \ a contentious history and a misguided belief that the other was bad, talking about\
  \ life as if we were distant relatives reunited. His shift ended and he hugged me\
  \ goodbye. \n\nOn my walk home I crossed Obispo and a sunset haze hung in the street\
  \ until it gave way to night. Two boys kicked a soccer ball around and their mothers\
  \ laughed in the courtyard of a crumbling colonial building. \n\nIn that moment\
  \ I didn\u2019t see politics or differences, I saw people living."
