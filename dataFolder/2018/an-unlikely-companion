Text: "I wondered, \"Colline du Ch\xE2teau or Mont Boron?\" Mont Boron seems less\
  \ popular, let's go there I thought. The streets were still wet from yesterday's\
  \ drizzle. There was a cold breeze in the air giving us the feel of European winter.\
  \ We felt the morning sun on our skin getting warmer as the cloud of the exhaled\
  \ foggy air diminished in size.\n\nWalking down the street we entered a souvenir\
  \ shop. It was like all other shops- key chain, fridge magnets, jewelry, cutlery,\
  \ showpieces. \nOne of the sections had soap bars. There were distinct varieties\
  \ of soaps of all kinds. \"Savon De Marseille\" I read on one of the soaps. \"Vegetable\
  \ oil hand crafted soaps, they have been around for over hundreds of years\" he\
  \ said. \"Can I have a few? And do you know any good pocket friendly food places\
  \ nearby?\" I asked him. \"There's a place not far away, I will be going there in\
  \ a while, if you guys...\" I intervened and asked if we could join him, it would\
  \ be fun to which he nodded and smiled.\nHis introduced himself as Naim. He told\
  \ us about his life, family, and how he feels about Nice, the Italian influence\
  \ of Nice's culture and architecture. He showed pictures of his year old daughter\
  \ and their recent trip to Japan where they met a real-life samurai. He talked about\
  \ the samurai with eagerness. It seemed like it was one of those childhood dreams\
  \ come true. We crossed Massena square on our way to the cafe. \"The seven statues\
  \ represent seven continents. It also represents the communication between the different\
  \ communities of today\u2019s society. They are illuminated every night and their\
  \ changing colors depict communication between them\" he said. The statutes looked\
  \ calm and in a state of peace mediating in the middle of the most iconic square\
  \ in Nice. It was beautiful.\n\nWe reached the cafe. It was a small place inside\
  \ a lemon colored building. We ordered Keftas and fries. He talked about his passion\
  \ for visiting countries with their own distinct culture alien to the European lands.\
  \ I told him about life in India, Bombay, overcrowded local commutes during rush\
  \ hours, local food, British influences in South Bombay. He paid the bill saying\
  \ he knows money crunches travelers face during their journey and also because someone\
  \ had helped him once. I told him to visit Bombay someday so I could buy him dinner.\
  \ We both laughed and bid goodbye.\nI hadn't seen him coming. Isn't this the beauty\
  \ of travel, these little moments of joy, little surprises around every corner waiting\
  \ to happen."
