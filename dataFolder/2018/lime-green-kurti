Text: "Priyanka wears a lime green Kurti, blue jogging pants and boots that hurt her\
  \ feet. Her brown eyes,set in unblemished white, make you hold your breath. Priyanka\u2018\
  s long black hair hasa vague hint of grey. She\u2019s a young wildlife conservationist,\
  \ one of a group of people, myself included, that are failing. \u2018Interesting\
  \ times,\u2019 I say but only if you think the loss of exquisite beauty is interesting.\
  \ \nAt least the forest here at Jambulne is a success. Reborn from the ashes of\
  \ slash and burn agriculture to a thriving secondary forest, with melodic insects\
  \ and birds. The songs make us smile, at least until we visit the nearby primary\
  \ forest- surrounded by land conversion leaving a fragment of the past. Here trees\
  \ are vast, jewelled with creepers and vines. \nThe natural symphony of it, falling\
  \ leaf litter, flitting paradise flycatchers and fungal aroma of a functioning system\
  \ makes the secondary forest an ecological infant. \nRaju, our guide, walks the\
  \ forest in flip flops. This is his home since birth. His lazy, balanced walk, keeps\
  \ him ahead of us in our sturdy boots. He stumbles once, we stumble every step as\
  \ we track roots, undergrowth and heavily-thorned trees. \nHe finds insects everywhere,\
  \ they find us too. Above us are the dreys of Malabar giant squirrels, rodents of\
  \ unusual size. Cries of crested serpent eagles ring through the trees. We find\
  \ the eyrie, a mass of twigs perched in a tree. \nWe see strange scrapes, the edges\
  \ at odds with the jumbled shapes of the forest. I ask Priyanka, she asks Raju in\
  \ Marathi, their common language, and translates, \u2018the tribal people dig for\
  \ land crabs,\u2019 she says. These people have extra rights here. They can access\
  \ the government forest, take food and resources from them, but we can\u2019t, though\
  \ we\u2019re allowed to visit with Raju. \nHe describes animals and plants as he\
  \ lazily outwalks us by a fair pace. The red silk cotton tree is used for water,\
  \ the fish poison bush helps catch fish, but will dislodge your teeth if you eat\
  \ it, wild hops is for earache, roots of nightshade alleviates scorpion stings.This\
  \ is an abundant natural resource.\nAfter two hours we\u2019re out into open grassland.\
  \ Beyond that the Cloud 9 resort has felled a chunk of forest and a road cuts the\
  \ land in two. Ribbon developments eat into the forest and Lion\u2019s Point is\
  \ filled to bursting with litter.\nI don\u2019t ask Raju or Priyanka what hope there\
  \ is for this pocket of wonder, so fragmented it probably already holds an extinction\
  \ debt which must be paid."
