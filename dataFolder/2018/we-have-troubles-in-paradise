Text: "Many meters below my feet, my eyes beheld the beautiful clear waters, ranging\
  \ from green to blue, the place looked like paradise, if wasn\u2019t all the chaos\
  \ it had brought to my life. I could never imagine that the biggest adventure of\
  \ my days in Florida would happen in a drab room of Cadillac Hotel.\nIt all started\
  \ about 380km from that hotel, in Orlando, Mickey\u2019s city. I organized my bag,\
  \ while my head was reproducing \"I'm in Miami Beach\" numerous times I imagine\
  \ the incredible place with beautiful beaches and great parties.\nI got on the bus\
  \ that's taking us and tried to stay awake watching the scenery through the window.\
  \ Trees. Trees. Finally houses, they look all the same and perfectly planned, unlike\
  \ the disorganized expansion of S\xE3o Paulo. \n My eyes weighed and I just woke\
  \ up in front of Cadillac Hotel where the plot twist happened, a bad feeling in\
  \ my chest and a question in my head \"Where is my phone?\". I rolled all my stuff\
  \ and retraced my steps. I\u2019d taken him to the bus, I was sure. I searched the\
  \ whole bus while the others ones go down.\n\"My dad will kill me!\" It was the\
  \ only thought that filled my head. \nAt night it still lost, so I took courage,\
  \ called to Brazil tolding everything to my parents. I never had seen my father\
  \ so angry, in all my life. \n\"Do a report!\" This sentence instated chaos.\nI\
  \ came to reception and asked to call to the police. In a few minutes, I was telling\
  \ how my phone just vanished on a bus, and despairing me more and more. Sobbing,\
  \ I put the phone down and ran, nervous.\nI went into the shower and let the water\
  \ ooze through my whole body and tears. After a few minutes I felt peace back to\
  \ my body, managing to calm down. Then I heard a knock on the door, I thought that\
  \ would one of the girls would open, but the sound doesn\u2019t ceased. I wrapped\
  \ myself in the bathrobe and opened the door wondering what was so urgent.\n\"Federal\
  \ police!\" \nI went into despair, never thought I could get to that point, it was\
  \ only a police report, I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong, right? The long hallway,\
  \ never seemed so full, all faces up the red carpet attentive to me.\nThe man ask\
  \ for my papers and increasingly the situation seemed worse. Even spoke one child\
  \ trafficking scheme, but I had just lost my phone. The guides were stressed giving\
  \ testimonials. The police was very annoyed with all the confusion, but sympathetic\
  \ with me explaining everything and what I should do. \n\"You\u2019ve generated\
  \ a big confusion. Police is a serious thing here!\"\nThat was how the paradise\
  \ became chaos."
