Text: "I detest taking decisions where I have to pick one thing among several options.\
  \ But owing to the shortage of currency I chose the elk embossed bookmark over embroidered\
  \ oven gloves, in a quaint vintage souvenir shop in downtown Stockholm.\n\nI was\
  \ still contemplating my decision, when the old man behind the counter broke the\
  \ noise in my head and the silence in his shop, \u201CDo you speak Hindi?\u201D\n\
  \nI gave him a gentle nod and a confused smile. \nAccidently meeting your countrymen\
  \ in a foreign land is as relieving as seeing your luggage arrive at the conveyer\
  \ belt. Each of us has experienced the same journey but differently, yet there is\
  \ always the comfort in familiarity.  \n\nI asked which part of the country he was\
  \ from but his answer took me by surprise;\n\u201CI live in a small neighborhood\
  \ in Upplands V\xE4sby, with my wife\u201D.\n\nI wondered if I should ask if he\
  \ had been to India lately since he hadn\u2019t quite comprehended my question.\n\
  \nIt was uncomfortable, knowing that he was aware of my confusion. \nHe held out\
  \ his hand and said, \u201CMy ancestors lived in Peshawar\u201D.\n\nOriginally from\
  \ Peshawar, Pakistan, he moved to Stockholm 45 years back and had little memory\
  \ of the place of his origin.\n\nHis decision to move to this cold, dark land which\
  \ spoke a language he didn\u2019t understand was a result of economic instability\
  \ in the 1970s.\n\nTrying not to offend him, I asked if he missed home.  \nHe looked\
  \ up from his phone with a wide smile and said,\n\"This is home\u201D.\nIf my ancestors\u2019\
  \ birthplace defines my origins, then how many years should I go back to?\nAnd who\
  \ gets to decide that?\nDon\u2019t we all have the same ancestors?\u201D\n\nEven\
  \ though his tone was meek, the questions he asked made me uncomfortable.\n \nThe\
  \ glint in his eyes and a warm smile told me, that he was happy with his decision.\n\
  With a soft calm voice he said \u201Cit was tough, but I\u2019d rather live in darkness\
  \ than in the dark\u201D.\n\nI looked at him with awe, wondering if the oven gloves\
  \ would go with my kitchen apron."
