Text: "I had a dream once.\nI was in a village surrounded by mountains. The people\
  \ there were kind and they cared for each other in a way I\u2019d never seen.\n\
  A woman asked me, \u201Cif you were an animal, what would you be?\u201D\n\u201C\
  Maybe a dog?\u201D I replied.\n\u201CWhy a dog? They mostly do what their masters\
  \ command.\u201D\nI thought about this. Dogs weren\u2019t my favourite animal, and\
  \ I didn\u2019t really want to be represented by one. Lately I had been insecure\
  \ and my self confidence was totally non-existent\u2026 so a dog.\n\nThe dream was\
  \ so vivid, so affronting. Even now, halfway across the country, I still feel it.\n\
  \nIt takes a while for my mind to quieten. For the noise of the city to fade away\
  \ and leave space for me to absorb the wonders of my life. I have almost everything\
  \ I want, yet the happiness that accompanies such a life eludes me. Considering\
  \ this, it can only be good that I\u2019m here. At this hot, sticky festival of\
  \ love and kindness, the Woodford Folk Festival.\n\n\u201CSevere thunderstorm. Large\
  \ hailstones/destructive winds/heavy rainfall eta 4pm Woodford Festival.\u201D The\
  \ message lights my phone as I step out of an African dance workshop. My booty sufficiently\
  \ shaken, the sober realisation that I can no longer \u201Cget low\u201D does nothing\
  \ to dampen my mood. A poignant concoction of rain and sweat soaks my clothes as\
  \ I lift my arms and face to the blackening clouds. I stay there a while, embracing\
  \ the rare feeling of total peace when standing in a storm. Heavy drops explode\
  \ into thousands of tiny diamonds against my skin.\n\nWith the African rhythm still\
  \ coursing through my veins, I crouch in the middle of the festival square and start\
  \ collecting stones.\n\n\u201CSomething simple\u201D I think.\nI place stones in\
  \ a tiny love heart, spiralling around and around.\n\n\u201CCan I help?\u201D She\
  \ isn\u2019t much taller than my waist. Her bright eyes look up at me and I take\
  \ her hands, pressing a few stones into her palms.\n\u201CI need your help\u2026\
  \ no one can build love alone\u201D.\n\nLilly and I work side by side. Every so\
  \ often she looks up at me, full to the brim with pride. Throughout the afternoon,\
  \ festival goers stop and add to our creation. Lilly skips up to them placing stones\
  \ in their palms, as I had done for her. By now the rain has subsided and the sun\
  \ takes a bow. Shadows begin to stain the stones and Lilly\u2019s parents drift\
  \ past one last time. As quickly as she arrived, Lilly is called away. I stand,\
  \ my heart full of love for the little girl that created this with me. Now ten metres\
  \ wide, it fills the square. I call it our Labyrinth of Love."
