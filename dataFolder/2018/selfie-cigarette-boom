Text: "Green mounds of sparse vegetation dotted the plain. Dozens of craters followed,\
  \ decades later, leaving the earth exposed to the sun's rays. A gentle breeze was\
  \ blowing. In one of the mountains there were rocks torn from what one day were\
  \ the remains of one of the tombs of the Laotian ancestors.\n\nThe sky was dark,\
  \ covered with clouds, and an engine that sounded like an airplane rang. \"Brrr\
  \ ... Boom.\" It was a tractor, far away. In 1969, an American pilot would have\
  \ already killed me with a bomb. As with the grave. There was no truce against the\
  \ communists (or against their history).\n\nI walked for a few hours through the\
  \ so-called Plain of Jars, east of Laos, in one of the three \"reasonably\" areas\
  \ cleared of the UXO the Americans dropped every 8 minutes for 9 years in the so-called\
  \ Secret War, in his battle to drown the communist rebellion financed by Ho Chi\
  \ Minh comrades. I was practically alone. The tourists did not come to hell.\n\n\
  The path was clearly indicated and getting out of it was exposing myself to, at\
  \ least a mutilation. But sometimes, reporters have the instinct to deviate from\
  \ the main route. After all, MAG (Mines Advisory Group, the international organization\
  \ that was in charge of cleaning the anti-person mines)  markers on the ground did\
  \ not inspire much confidence. \n\nAbove the small hill that surrounded the area,\
  \ the breeze took more strength, due to the absence of obstacles. The bushes waved\
  \ with the same gesture as the queens greet the people: hermetic, robust, robotic.\
  \ Among several of them there was small hole that deepened inside the stone, connecting\
  \ with an interior space.\n\nI immediately rushed down a narrow vertical path that\
  \ returned to the plain. To the left, behind some branches, a very high cave opened,\
  \ not too deep, to which an altar had been placed in the center. From above a column\
  \ of celestial light fell right in the middle of the table. In that cavity, turned\
  \ into a sanctuary, about 200 people use it to hide of the American bombings. Until\
  \ a projectile fell. The light that killed them now illuminated the darkness.\n\n\
  Several kilometers away, there was the second site, more discreet. A group of teenagers\
  \ arrived with their scooters and lit some cigarettes. The girls were looking for\
  \ the best selfie. And I could not stop thinking: Selfie, cigarette ... Boom!"
