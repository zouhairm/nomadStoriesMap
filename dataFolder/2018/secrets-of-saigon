Text: "As we approached the towering gates, we were met by a Vietnamese local. He\
  \ was guarding the gloomy apartment building which was long dilapidated, and masked\
  \ with graffiti. My guide, Tuyen, tells me this is one of many Colonial buildings\
  \ anticipating demolition by the government. However, owned by Elder Vietnamese\
  \ families, the buildings cannot be destroyed until their deaths. In an act of defiance,\
  \ these families have rigged electricity from the main power lines on the street,\
  \ illuminating the cold concrete walls once again.\n\nWe climb the flights of stairs\
  \ silently, stopping to read the myriad of flyers posted around the vintage swinging\
  \ elevator doors, long out of use. Tuyen studies each poster intently. He looks\
  \ nostalgic. These buildings are a part of his country, his history. There is an\
  \ unspoken feeling of sadness in the air that he will one day no longer be able\
  \ to share them with people like me.\n \nAt the top of each set of stairs light\
  \ shimmers into my eyes from a different direction. Calling to me like beams of\
  \ sunlight on a cold winter day. Tiny illegal shops set up in corners buzz with\
  \ vibrancy and activity, a stark contrast to the eerie hallways. Tuyen leads me\
  \ toward one particular light. A hidden coffee shop. Inconspicuous and dimly light,\
  \ with only the sound of a fan humming throughout, and the quiet whispers of locals.\
  \ I am the only Westerner in the room, but no one notices. My guide orders me a\
  \ milk tea as I pet a stray cat, one of many that day. \u201CWash your hands\u201D\
  , he chuckles. I remember that he is highly allergic. \n\nThe window over the rustic\
  \ stand-alone sink looks out to bright, lush greenery, surprisingly hidden from\
  \ the bustling city below. As I turn back to where Tuyen is sitting, my eyes have\
  \ to readjust to the dimly lit room. It has a feel of a lounge room in a forgotten\
  \ house. Old couches are arranged sporadically, artworks lean against the walls,\
  \ and piles of books tower on every table and corner of floorboard.\n \nA man brings\
  \ our tea as Tuyen picks up an old guitar and begins to play. He is beautiful in\
  \ that moment. In his own wonderland. This coffee shop and this building is so intimately\
  \ him. This is his world, and I get to share it ever so briefly. We don\u2019t speak.\
  \ I fall into the lull of the music, and with the cold sweet milk on my lips, I\
  \ close my eyes and melt into Saigon."
