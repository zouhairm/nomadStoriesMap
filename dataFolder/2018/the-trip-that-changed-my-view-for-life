Text: "Hey! This is me a typical indian girl with a loving and caring family. Outing\
  \ with friends going on trips are not things allowed in my family as being a single\
  \ girl child everyone is very possesive, but in my last year of B.pharma i finally\
  \ got the chance to go for collage trip, All thanks to my syallabus which include\
  \ tour. So before going on trip my way of seeing a life is totally different, i\
  \ was scared of everything like staying away from parents, taking risks, talking\
  \ new peoples, n so on.. But after this i met a new me. So we went to himachal pradesh\
  \ and i was exited as hell for seeing snow we went to dalhousie first and the view\
  \ of snow capped himalyas are just breathtaking. Riding on the coverd with pine\
  \ trees valley n view of snow capped mountains are just beyond explaing. Stayed\
  \ in hotel president there and along with views food is also awsome. Then our trip\
  \ proceeded to khajjiar its called mini switerzland of india and by going there\
  \ you can easily know why ? The green garss is spreaded like quilt hundreds to trees\
  \ along with many activities like horse riding zoorbing etc.  Standing there and\
  \ enjoying the view with tea with cool breeze is just beautiful.  We have seen a\
  \ lot of different people with accent different from us even being in the same country\
  \ with different languague different way and standerd of living as its india n here\
  \ is lots of diversity not only of religion but even in states town languague changes\
  \ here every 200 km we all knew this but we have seen it now. Churches there are\
  \ just beyond beautiful. Natural spirtual mental physical all beauties in one  place\
  \ can be seen in himachal. I am glad i got a chance to see those all because of\
  \ which i am now more independent more risk taking and more succsfull.\U0001F60A\
