Text: "Browsing through those pages is like letting the memories jump out of it. Moments\
  \ that if I wouldn\u2019t have preserved them in this little notebook, would have\
  \ vanished. I can see the faces of my friends, I can see us like an observer from\
  \ above. Three boys packed with their belongings, their hopes, curiosity and a little\
  \ bit of fear. Nothing in the pockets but the hope for the summer of their life\u2026\
  I kept a lot of little things from the trip like napkins from were tasted new food;\
  \ tickets from busses that took us were we hadn\u2019t been before. Things with\
  \ no other value than the one that I give them now, when they transport me back\
  \ to the moments, even the bad ones like in Poland.\n\nAnd there we were the three\
  \ of us around a little coffee table in between the bunks of that cute, grandma\
  \ style arranged Warsaw\u2019s hostel. Opened out in front of us, we had our big\
  \ map and lots of papers showing us all of the options and possibilities to continue\
  \ our journey. \n\nWe were in the middle of our trip around Europe and at the same\
  \ time facing the most important decision: should we continue up to Finland? Seeing\
  \ Tallinn, Helsinki and then going up to the Sea of Barents. Which is the northernmost\
  \ point of the country or turning back to the East of Europe through Germany and\
  \ heading to Sweden across Denmark.\n\nIt was a tough and tense moment of our trip.\
  \ We already had the buses booked to Tallinn but we were running out of money. Spending\
  \ the nights outside in cold Finland didn\u2019t seem that ideal. Our plan? No other\
  \ than taking the Santa Clause Express from Helsinki till Rovaniemi, and then crossing\
  \ the border from up there till Sweden and going down to Oslo. \n\nEnding our journey\
  \ among the crystal-clear lakes reflecting the picture of the massive mountains\
  \ peaking out of the water, the deep green forests wider than the eyes could see.\
  \ And everything from the comfort of our seats on a train. The authentic railway\
  \ trip experience as its best.\n\nAppealing as it was, we were facing the hard truth\
  \ of finding ourselves too lost in the North of a country we didn\u2019t know, and\
  \ the worst part? We were spending hours arguing and not exploring. In that moment\
  \ we realized that the only thing we wanted deep inside was to get out from the\
  \ hostel and walking and discovering every part of the city we just arrived to.\n\
  \nLooking at it now, I learned that sometimes in life, the only real thing you need\
  \ is to set a new course, a couple of good friends and the aim to reach places you\
  \ haven\u2019t been before."
