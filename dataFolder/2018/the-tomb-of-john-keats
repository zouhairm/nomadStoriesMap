Text: "I reached Rome the day before the concert. It was a Friday morning, in the\
  \ middle of July. For a few days the Eternal City, 25 centuries of history, me and\
  \ - of course - a night with U2. On my back just a backpack. A little money in my\
  \ pockets, and a book of poetry in my hand.\nPoetry: the polar star of this travel.\
  \ I'd have visited the tombs of two of the greatest poets ever, Keats and Shelley,\
  \ who both rest in the Protestant Cemetery of Rome. It was an idea. But first a\
  \ tour of the monuments of the city. I'd have paid my respects to the Great Poets\
  \ later. No hurry. \n\nSo I started to walk. \nThe shade of the holm oaks in a park\
  \ near Castel Sant'Angelo. The beating marble heart of Roman Reinassance: St. Peter's\
  \ Square. Further, alongside the banks of the Tiber - step after step, bridge after\
  \ bridge - my thoughts flowed as its waters. I lost the count and cognition of distances\
  \ and time. Drunken by the stories that those places can tell, staring the Colosseum,\
  \ the Imperial Fora, the Pantheon. Deep in thought, absorbed in that ocean of people\
  \ and lives. Breathing the air of the seven hills, the dust, the songs of birds,\
  \ the smell of trees. The dusk came, and - rambling through those streets and lights,\
  \ soaked of fellinian magic - I realized it was too late to visit the cemetery.\
  \ I put it off for the next day. \n\nThe next morning I met Dario, a friend of mine.\
  \ \xABWould you like to visit the tomb of Keats?\xBB I asked. He laughed: \xABVisiting\
  \ a cemetery, now, in this heat? You are definitely crazy!\xBB. Maybe he was right,\
  \ I thought. Fine, it was just an idea. A silly one.\nWe reached the stadium.\n\
  There, poetry again: on the huge screen scrolled several poems. One hit me: \u201C\
  The world is a beautiful place\u201D, by L. Ferlinghetti. Yes, it is.\nThen the\
  \ unforgettable show: amazing songs; the astonishing visuals; Bono who praised the\
  \ poetry breathed in Rome, and who said he had visited the tomb of Keats on that\
  \ morning; and... wait! \nBono at the tomb of Keats? That same morning? I could\
  \ have been there, and I missed him!\nI gave Dario my worst gaze. He laughed, so\
  \ did I. We enjoyed the rest of concert.\n\nThat idea! A BRILLIANT one. One of the\
  \ best of my life. Who could say that?\nBittersweet end, lesson learned: while on\
  \ a trip any idea could be source of surprises. You should always follow your instinct\
  \ in order to enjoy experiences that you could never have planned. Otherwise, you\
  \ could regret it!\nLike I do for having not visited a cemetery, in a warm midsummer\
  \ morning, in Rome."
