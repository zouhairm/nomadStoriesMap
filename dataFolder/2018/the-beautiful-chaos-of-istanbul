  \ My first 2 seconds in Istanbul and I was already in love. The beautiful, chaotic\
  \ energy of the city hits you as soon as you step out of the airport.\n\nI had a\
  \ new job teaching English at a language school in central Istanbul. But as a gay\
  \ man in an OK-but-not-so-gay-friendly country, I had to find a safe place to live.\
  \ I found a little gay-friendly hotel and was hoping to rent a room for a few weeks,\
  \ but as luck would have it they knew someone who needed a roommate. Gotta love\
  \ the gay community \u2013 we definitely look out for each other.\n\nA few days\
  \ later and I was sitting in a caf\xE9 in Cihangir \u2013 look for Fir\xFCza\u011F\
  a Camii (mosque) and the caf\xE9 underneath has the best \xE7ay (tea) in the city!\
  \ And on that cold December day, walking down the street I see a man and his dog\
  \ (a gorgeous Labrador). The man smiles at me, \u2018Steve?\u2019 he asks. \u201C\
  Murat?\u201D I smile back. \n\nFrom that moment on Murat and I were friends. His\
  \ energy was infectious and he always had a smile. We looked after Efe (the dog),\
  \ went to amazing local restaurants (\xC7a\u011Fda\u015F on S\u0131raselviler Street\
  \ has the best b\xF6rek in Istanbul), he taught me Turkish, I taught him English,\
  \ and with his help I found my feet in that crazy city.\n\nEvery day walking around\
  \ this enormous city is a joyous fight for space on the pavement among the millions\
  \ of Turks rushing about. The daily chaos of life on the street mixed with the call\
  \ to prayer floating above creates a magical feeling.\n\nMurat showed me that Istanbul\
  \ is full of hidden secrets, like the immigrant-run Georgian restaurant that opened\
  \ up at the old bus station, or the friendly bar above a bookshop that became known\
  \ to us as the \u201Clibrary\u201D. Or Limonlu Bah\xE7e (The Lemon Garden), just\
  \ off Istiklal Street, hidden behind a building but is an open-air restaurant snuggled\
  \ among lemon trees.\n\nAnd on a day off we could visit a Camii to marvel at the\
  \ incredible detail, wander near the mighty Bosphorus, catch the ferry to have a\
  \ coffee in Asia, return to Europe to watch the fisherman on Galata K\xF6pr\xFC\
  s\xFC (Galata Bridge) and eat Balik Ekmek (freshly cooked fish in bread), and finish\
  \ the night with beers in lively Be\u015Fikta\u015F. \n\nI owe Murat so much. The\
  \ immediate friendship he showed me, the incredible warm welcome he gave me is what\
  \ kept me in Istanbul for more than two years, and made me love the city even more.\
  \ The power of that local connection means that Istanbul will always have a special\
  \ place in my heart, and I cannot wait to return."
