Text: "Days at the Hindu retreat center in Kerala, India began with a single, abrupt\
  \ knock at the door. \"Coffee, teaaaa!\" the voice bellowed down the corridor. Sometimes,\
  \ after my first cautious sips of milky, steaming chai, I would sit on the stone\
  \ steps outside the dormitory and listen. Beneath the stars of the early morning,\
  \ the chanting at Anandashram had begun.\n\"Om sri ram, jai ram, jai jai ram; om\
  \ sri ram, jai ram, jai jai ram!\" \nIn a small, gazebo-like building called a mandir,\
  \ devout disciples of the late Swami Ram Das orbited their guru's grave. Twelve\
  \ hours a day, prayer beads swung leisurely in their hands as they chanted the mantra\
  \ Papa Swami had given to them. Men and women, traditionally separated, took shifts\
  \ by the half hour.  As my husband exited the mandir, I was walking inside. We smiled\
  \ shyly at one another, fully aware that we had no idea what we were doing. We were\
  \ officially in the holy land of India.\nI met Pratibha in the dining hall over\
  \ a traditional south Indian breakfast of fluffy idlis and mouthwatering coconut\
  \ chutney. A perky, 65-year-old Indian woman with short silver hair, she sat down\
  \ next to me, pointed at Aaron across the hall, and asked in her perfect British\
  \ English, \u201CIs he your husband?\u201D Intrigued by such a young American marriage,\
  \ she initiated a lasting, unlikely friendship.\nThe next week we three could be\
  \ found a few kilometers from the ashram, strolling through an abandoned palace\
  \ along the coast of the Arabian Sea. We watched dolphins through embrasures in\
  \ the old military architecture, sharing stories of mythology and of our lives.\
  \ We all had so many questions\u2014what's with Indians and feet? Why is everyone\
  \ in America divorced? Within days, she had become our friend and our mother. When\
  \ it came time for Aaron and I to continue traveling, Pratibha said, \"You must\
  \ meet Kuber and Krupa.\"\nSo we reconnected. Our last night in India was spent\
  \ with Pratibha's son and his wife. In a great festive blur, we sped down the streets\
  \ of Mumbai with the exponential enthusiasm of four twenty-somethings. The car was\
  \ buzzing with philosophical theories, hysterical laughter, and American film reviews.\
  \ We soon discovered that Kuber owned a shot bar, where we were treated with the\
  \ finest Indian hospitality\u2014servers ceaselessly bringing rounds of tiny, intoxicating\
  \ concoctions.  \nEventually, Krupa dragged me from the booth onto the strobing\
  \ dancefloor. Over the music, I shouted, \"How do you dance here?!\"\n\"It's music!\"\
  \ she laughed. \"Just dance!\""
