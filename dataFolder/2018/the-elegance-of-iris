Text: "Slovenia and I had a rough start. A gash on my eye, a car accident, and a terrible\
  \ travel day were not how I intended to enter the country. It was two weeks into\
  \ my second solo trip and I was exhausted. Quickly, I put on a smile to meet a local\
  \ who was ecstatic to practice her English with me.\n\nIris arrived at my hostel\
  \ straight from the 60's on her beach cruiser, in high waist jeans and a t-shirt.\
  \ As we began walking to Ljubljana, she told me the history of her country and showed\
  \ me iconic landmarks as we got to know one another. Immediately, I felt welcomed.\
  \ In a country with just 2 million people, the capital was more like a small town\
  \ because Iris knew everyone.\n\nLjubljana is beautiful; it\u2019s like being taken\
  \ back in time and experiencing nostalgia for a place you\u2019ve never been. With\
  \ mountains in the distance, a castle on a hill, and charming architecture, it\u2019\
  s no wonder that it wasn't destroyed during both World Wars. It\u2019s been safely\
  \ tucked away as what I like to think is Europe\u2019s hidden gem. People and time\
  \ move slowly here, and eventually we found ourselves eating al fresco with local\
  \ fish and a glass of wine.\n\nI had never seen something so elegant as Iris deftly\
  \ rolling a cigarette. She tossed her hair to one side as she brought a lit match\
  \ near. Cool and confident, she leaned back in her chair as she crossed one leg\
  \ to take her first drag. She exhaled a delicate cloud of smoke. My whole life I\
  \ had been told how terrible smoking was, yet as I sat there absorbing her accent\
  \ and watching her painted lips meet her cigarette everything I knew dissipated\
  \ like her soft exhales. She was the kind of girl mid-century authors wrote about\
  \ when they traveled to Europe. The kind of woman that captivates you. The unrequited\
  \ love soldiers came back to America with. Entranced, I was interrupted by the arrival\
  \ of my fish, which to my surprise, was completely whole. Iris laughed at my confusion\
  \ and showed me how to eat my dinner, which ended up being the best damn fish I\
  \ had ever had.\n\nWe strolled back to the river in Ljubljana to meet her friends\
  \ for drinks. The two other girls were just as elegant smoking their cigarettes,\
  \ and ever so eager to speak English. We sat for hours telling stories of love,\
  \ lust and adventure, laughing like girlfriends do over wine. In a foreign city\
  \ with complete strangers, I never felt more at home. Ljubljana, means \u201Cto\
  \ be loved,\u201D and oddly enough, there couldn\u2019t have been a more perfect\
  \ name for this city or these people."
