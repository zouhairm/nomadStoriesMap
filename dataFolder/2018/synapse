Text: "Brussels, Zaventem airport, arrive, didn\u2019t expect rain, but feels good.\
  \ Got loose with the train to arrive to Brugge, eat a waffle before taking the good\
  \ one. Wrong station, skip Brugge, arrive to Ostend. Think, good opportunity to\
  \ see the North sea. Come back, sleep, more water sailing the canals. Ghent, so\
  \ cold, hot chocolate, feels good. Antwerp two days walking, tired? yes Diamonds?\
  \ not enough money. People, in the trains. People, in the cities. People that help\
  \ to feel less lose. Charleroi, airport, go back, home. \nIs this the real local\
  \ connection? \_\nMaking a local connection really starts inside of us, through\
  \ the synapse. A torrent of both, chemical and electric that bond all the emotions\
  \ felt and the experiences collected during the trip, straight to your memory, direct\
  \ to yourself. A physical bond that immediately transport to the precise moment\
  \ that you want with, a smell, a familiar smile, just a little reminder. Because\
  \ the real connection is an inner connection, an inside network of neurons that\
  \ will always be there to connect you with the place you\u2019ve been, even if you\u2019\
  re not there anymore. A smell, a drop of rain, an emotion, a flavour. Everything\
  \ is a way to travel back through your mind. \nTravel making a local connection\
  \ is a process of autoknowledge, the creation of new connections in your brain that\
  \ gives, not just root yourself to a physical place, blooms your inside with all\
  \ the information gathered. \nAnd that is when you notice what a local connection\
  \ really means. It\u2019s not when you are in the Grand Place, eating that waffle,\
  \ it\u2019s not when you are touching the North Sea in Ostend for the first time,\
  \ it\u2019s not sail all the canals in Brugge: the local connection is the memory\
  \ that you have of all of this when it\u2019s done, when you can\u2019t be surviving\
  \ the cold with the best hot chocolate that you drank, when you can\u2019t have\
  \ this experience in front, when you\u2019re not really living them, is when you\
  \ really connect with what you have done. The appreciation of all comes when we,\
  \ as travelers and human beings, already enjoy it. That is why we feel homesick,\
  \ why we want to travel more. Making a real local connection is what makes you enjoy\
  \ the magic of the flashbacks looking within yourself. The more you travel the more\
  \ you ask yourself: \u201CWhat can I see?\u201D."
