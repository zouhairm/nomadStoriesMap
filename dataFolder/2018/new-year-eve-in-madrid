Text: "New year. New me, was my choice for 2018.\nBeing a solo traveler is not always\
  \ fun for most of us. To me, It was the beginning of the adventure. \nI always travel\
  \ with my friends, sometimes I do not like their choices but I want someone to accompany\
  \ me. \nThis year I traveled differently and left my comfort zone.\nThe first day,\
  \ I decided to not book a fancy hotel to stay in but to couch-surf with a local\
  \ man who gave a whole new conception of locals' life. Meeting a group of 30 people\
  \ in Madrid to spend the new year was the last thing I expected me to do. 10 days\
  \ in Madrid opened my mind to more than 15 culture of different countries of people\
  \ that I just meet. Also saved money, free accommodation, and dinner sharing. \n\
  I tried the 12 grapes of luck. Eating 12 grapes at midnight on New Year\u2019s Eve\
  \ is a tradition in Spain. One grape for each stroke of midnight could change your\
  \ year to have 12 months of luck. The tradition consists of eating a grape with\
  \ each bell strike at midnight of December 31.\nI cannot lie that I was afraid of\
  \ chocking, as everyone focuses on eating all 12 grapes of luck, I was focusing\
  \ on, not to chock and die away and alone.\nI made friends from all over the world\
  \ that day. I felt lucky \"maybe because of the grapes\", where my year started\
  \ to be more fun and clear to me.\nwho would imagine that in some countries the\
  \ typical breakfast could be chocolate, Spanish breakfast is a dream came true where\
  \ the famous churros con chocolate in the chocolateria San Gines in Madrid is perfect\
  \ for chocolate's lovers. \nGran Via street in Madrid was a great place to spend\
  \ the day in, but I learned from locals that never eat in a touristic place because\
  \ food will never be good. So searching for restaurants in small corners to taste\
  \ the traditional Tapas, Jamon or tortilla was a challenge."
