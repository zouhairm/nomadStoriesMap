Text: "As we waited for our food to arrive we poured iced water into our glasses.\
  \ My body welcomed the cold water with relief. I envied the youngsters that we saw\
  \ jumping from the old city walls into the sea. Their screams of joy, the splashing\
  \ of water on their sun-kissed bodies. Earlier that morning we had visited the Jama\
  \ El-Anwar, Israel's largest mosque among the ones built in Palestine during the\
  \ Ottoman period. Also, Elad\u2019s first visit to a mosque. Mesmerized, at the\
  \ end of the visit he had given the guide a spontaneous 50 shekels tip. Initially,\
  \ he hadn\u2019t wanted to come to Akko. But eventually, there we were, sitting\
  \ for the second day in a row in the same tiny restaurant in the bazaar area, and\
  \ waiting for the sinaya, a Palestinian dish, consisting of ground beef with fragrant\
  \ spices, onions, and tahini. \n\u201CThat\u2019s the best meal I\u2019ve ever had\
  \ in Israel\u201D he groaned, sandwiching a piece of the meat into the hot pita\
  \ and dipping it into the sauce. \nThe day before we had spent two hours at the\
  \ Ghattas Bath, the largest functioning hammam in Akko, also run by a lovely Arab\
  \ family. They had offered us fresh fruit, biscuits, and coffee with cardamom. Elad\
  \ had frozen after the first sip. \n\u201CWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201D I had asked.\
  \ \n\u201CThat\u2019s the scent of my grandparents\u2019 house\u201D he had replied.\
  \ \n \u201CWhen I was a kid, we often spent Shabbat at my grandparents. I was a\
  \ bit afraid because I didn\u2019t understand Arabic and boy, Moroccans are loud!\u201D\
  \ he had laughed at the memory. \nWe had spent the rest of the afternoon roaming\
  \ the old bazaar in search of the coffee to take back home. We had walked around\
  \ the maze of covered streets and caravansarais. We had shared a spicy shawarma.\
  \ Eventually, we had found a small shop where the owner had been more than happy\
  \ to help us select the coffee beans and to ground them with just the right amount\
  \ of cardamom. \nNow, after finishing the last morsel of sinaya we were ready to\
  \ head back to Ashdod. \n\u201CWhen I was a kid, I was very confused by the fact\
  \ that my parents were speaking Arabic at the family\u2019s gatherings and at the\
  \ same time I was told to be afraid of Arabs\u201D he paused, then continued \u201C\
  You know what would be nice?\u201D he asked. \n\u201CNo, tell me\u201D\n\u201CIf\
  \ the way they live here in Akko could be applied to all the country\u201D he replied.\n\
  \u201CWhat do you mean?\u201D \n\u201CI mean, all of us, living together, sharing\
  \ this country, respecting each other, wouldn\u2019t be perfect?\u201D \nYes, it\
  \ would. Indeed it would."
