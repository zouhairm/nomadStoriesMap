Text: "\"You don't need love, you are love.\"\n\nThere is so much beauty in stillness.\
  \ It surrounds us, offering itself like a playful puppy. All you need to offer in\
  \ return is the attention it requires to grow. And within you it will grow. A relationship\
  \ built on connection. That is the foundation of/for love.\n\nAs I take a sip of\
  \ this warm ginger tea it envelopes my inner world, the way that it does, and intended\
  \ to. It sends signals to my body that the time has come to rise and respond with\
  \ excitement that a new day has begun; and to awaken my cells, who respond in kind\
  \ by tingling to attention, ready for the experiences that lay ahead. I ingest another\
  \ sip, the tingling increases. What a beautiful reciprocal relationship they have.\
  \ Give - receive - repeat. It is imperative that one begins with giving (action)\
  \ in order for the receiving (reaction) to occur (and if we alternate that order,\
  \ we can understand the opposite and negative way in which it would operate). In\
  \ fact, I think the relationship would be quite different, toxic even, if the first\
  \ thing I ingested was Coca-Cola, or coffee for that matter (or anything that I\
  \ am expecting something from, rather than allowing or appreciating).\n\nLooking\
  \ out to the horizon, I see lush farmland, animals freely roaming, trees swaying\
  \ in the morning breeze, all shades of green, and yellow, and blue sky. The ultimate\
  \ offeror, the Sun, who began this relationship, warms my back. As I sit writing\
  \ these words, the world is calm, & still, the birds singing are its soundtrack.\
  \ Again, a relationship started by the act of giving.\nGiving isn't easy\u2026 sometimes.\
  \ Sometimes, we find ourselves in places & spaces where all we want to feel is whole\
  \ again. So, we take & take in a hope to fill that void. But, it never works. In\
  \ fact, all we have done is made greater the void to fill when we come to the understanding\
  \ that all we need is love (da da da da daa) \u2026 That love starts from giving\
  \ and giving starts from within.\n\nSo, perhaps, giving is easy - it simply requires\
  \ you to put somebody else first. To desire their smile. To revel in their happiness,\
  \ joy, accomplishments & achievements. Imagine a world where everybody wanted others\
  \ to succeed before they did, to thrive on life, to feel loved\u2026 it's easy,\
  \ if you try. \n\n\"Give with the hope that it shall return and the knowledge that\
  \ it need not.\"\n\nBut\u2026 there is a trick to this whole process that perhaps\
  \ not many are fully aware of...\n\n(cont'd over at thestampedetrail.com)"
