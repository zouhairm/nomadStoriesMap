Text: "A twelve year-old girl, confined by illness to her home in England, had one\
  \ dream: to see Green Day, her favourite band, in the United States.\n\nTents, duvets\
  \ and camping chairs were littered around the doors of the State Farm Center in\
  \ Champaign, Illinois. Strangers offered me hugs and cookies; Caitlin, from Indiana,\
  \ baked them just for the show. Doors opened in ten hours\u2019 time, and some people\
  \ had been there since midday the previous day. Perhaps I should have felt alone,\
  \ even afraid, by myself in the middle of nowhere, but I did not.\n\nWhen the doors\
  \ swung open, elbows dug into my back and arms. Scanners beeped to accept tickets.\
  \ Security swiped me with metal detectors. Then I was in, sprinting off into the\
  \ stampede that thundered down steps and onto the floor. There, a lady heard my\
  \ accent and with a smile, said she was going to find her son and ushered me into\
  \ her spot on the front row.\n\nAs \u2018Bohemian Rhapsody,\u2019 the band\u2019\
  s entrance song, played I felt sick and giddy and my heart was pounding. Billie\
  \ Joe Armstrong ran onstage first, then Tr\xE9 Cool and Mike Dirnt. Billie Joe stood\
  \ atop the amps, drawing roars from the crowd with flicks of his wrists. Tr\xE9\
  \ began playing their first song, \u2018Know Your Enemy.\u2019\n\n\u2018I need some\
  \ help! Who knows the lyrics to the song?\u2019\n\nMy hand was in the air and Billie\
  \ Joe pointed at me.\n\n\u2018She knows it? Alright, get your ass up here!\u2019\
  \n\nI heard yells of \u2018oh my God!\u2019 and my name as I was hauled over the\
  \ barrier. I stood up on the stage and my legs gave way. There was no time to feel\
  \ embarrassed. Billie Joe was beckoning me and as I ran, his face lit up with a\
  \ grin as he held out his arms to hug me. Then he was passing me the microphone,\
  \ I was standing in front of 14,000 people in Champaign, Illinois, barely noticing\
  \ the pyros exploding for me as I sang.\n\nI knew then Billie Joe would tell me\
  \ to stage dive. Fear paralysed me. I opened my mouth to tell him I couldn\u2019\
  t\u2026 but I ran. I jumped.\n\nIllinois caught me. People hugged and high-fived\
  \ me when my feet hit the floor.\n\nMy ecstatic daze was interrupted only when I\
  \ sang along to \u2018Still Breathing\u2019:\n\n\u2018As I walked out on the ledge,\
  \ are you scared to death to live?\u2019\n\nI recalled that twelve year-old girl,\
  \ with a dream that seemed impossible and my words caught in my throat.\n\nI once\
  \ walked out on the ledge, as I did on that stage, scared to death to live. But\
  \ I jumped, I lived on, to realise a dream more incredible than I ever could have\
  \ imagined.\n\nNow I am afraid of nothing."
