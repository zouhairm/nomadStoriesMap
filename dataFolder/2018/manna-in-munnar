Text: "In The summer of 2010 we took a dingy trans-state bus to the undulating tea\
  \ plantations of Munnar in South India, not just to experience the cool mountain\
  \ air redolent with the sharp medicinal fragrance of Eucalyptus, and to savour tea\
  \ spiced with cardamom, cinnamon and cloves, but also to discover for the first\
  \ time, the Malabari Appams.\nThe dome shaped crepes made with fermented rice flour\
  \ were soft and spongy in the centre and tapered to a crisp at the edges, and were\
  \ created using a wok style pan in which the batter was swirled with expert twists\
  \ of the wrist. All of this I had gleaned from travel shows on TV, and I was excited\
  \ to see if they lived up to my epicurean expectations. \nWe arrived at Munnar just\
  \ in time for lunch and headed straight for the first \u2018Saadya \u2018joint,\
  \ where we were served lunch on a banana leaf ;a colourful assortment of veggies\
  \ and curries as well as the local parboiled red rice. Parboiling was the act of\
  \ steaming the rice husk prior to milling; driving the nutrients from the bran into\
  \ the grain, as well as making the rice easier to digest. But no appams were served.\
  \ \nAs evening set in, we wandered around the market asking shop owners and spice\
  \ dealers where we could get appam and chicken stew, and they directed us to street\
  \ food stalls, which led us to the popular hiking area around Mattupetty Dam, a\
  \ popular scenic hiking trail where we were happy to spot bustling street food stalls\
  \ at the base of the hill. Tiny marble sized speckled quail eggs were being served\
  \ as bite sized sunny side ups, and we savoured them along with sambar flavoured\
  \ maggi noodles with curry leaves, a malabari twist to India\u2019s favourite instant\
  \ noodles .And yet, no appams in sight. \nWe spent the next few days visiting spice\
  \ plantations and  tea factories, bought bottles of exotic essential oils and bars\
  \ of homemade chocolates to take back home, and soon it was our time to go back\
  \ home.\nEvery food blogger worth their peppercorns had raved about the appams of\
  \ Kerala, but I realised that even without the experience I had had a deliciously\
  \ memorable visit to Munnar. Food remains, till date, the deepest local connection\
  \ to the lands I travel to.\nAnd yet,  minutes before our bus journey, we spotted\
  \ a lone street vendor spinning out appams on his bowl shaped pan! And there we\
  \ stood among blaring street horns, and the sweet smell of diesel from the bus stand,\
  \ eating  appam crepes soaked in chicken curry slow cooked in spices from the hills."
