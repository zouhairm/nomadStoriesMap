Text: "Gasping for breath, I stopped the engine, took off my helmet and wiped the\
  \ sweat from my forehead. The way up the Nakkerd Hills wearied me completely. Now\
  \ I knew I had chosen the wrong vehicle. A feeble rented scooter and my inexperienced\
  \ driving turned six kilometers of a steep, mountainous road into a challenge rather\
  \ than an adventure.\n\nBeing indignant with the lady from \u201CRent and drive\u201D\
  \ as well as myself for short-sightedness, I took my eyes up. There, high above\
  \ the sea and generously overlooking the whole island of Phuket, stood an enormous\
  \ monument of The Big Buddha. \n\nThis 45-meters tall statue was a sacred place\
  \ for Buddhists and other so-believers. Spiritual locals and outsiders would come\
  \ for worshipping or donating, and mundane tourists would come for the view. The\
  \ faithful would bow quietly and mutter prayers to the Universe; the careless would\
  \ chat loudly, take unimaginative pictures and feed monkeys.\n\nI, neither being\
  \ a person with much faith in religion, laws of karma and all those spiritual things\
  \ nor a shallow tourist, reached the Big Buddha in search of cultural spots for\
  \ exploring and self-inspiring. \n\nI made my way towards and through the entrance.\
  \ A young Thai lady, whose reluctant job was to give unthinking tourists a sarong\
  \ to cover up their beachwear, nodded approvingly as I passed.\n\nHaving reached\
  \ the front of the statue, for a decent while I stood and enjoyed the view: the\
  \ infinite ocean together with pre-sunset skies and thick, tropical flora were truly\
  \ breathtaking. Finally, I turned around, facing the stairs and The Big Buddha himself.\
  \ \n\nHe sat there, legs-crossed, snow-white, grand, his deep marble eyes fixed\
  \ on me from every angle. Bewildered, I ushered forward. Though the site was packed\
  \ with crowds, Buddha\u2019s eyes were following me wherever I stepped and I, in\
  \ return, was staring in his.\n\nHours and hours\u2019d passed until I realized\
  \ I\u2019d been strolling there, listening to the sweet tinkling of tiny bells,\
  \ thinking nothing. A completely new feeling hit me like a wave: my mind was peacefully\
  \ empty. None of the problems of the earthy life seemed to exist, and neither did\
  \ people, dashing around. The unbelievable positive energy of the site fully absorbed\
  \ me. \n\nJust when the island sank into the deep darkness, I reached my not-so-bad\
  \ scooter, put on my helmet cheerfully and started my engine.\n\n\u201DKob khun-ka\u201D\
  , I murmured to him with all my heart and set off, utterly happy, full of hope to\
  \ keep this state of mind for long."
