Text: "So much springs to mind when someone mentions the words \"The Motherland\"\
  . Nowhere, however, comes as quickly to the forefront of our imaginations like the\
  \ burning orange sun setting over the African savanna. Africa in its entirety is\
  \ one of the most culturally diverse countries in the world. It exudes life and\
  \ excitement out of ever nook and cranny to such an extent that we call it the cradle\
  \ of life. Its rich diversity is spread far and wide, yet for many travellers, the\
  \ best of Africa appears encapsulated within South Africa. From beautiful mountain\
  \ ranges, lush greenery, the wildest animals, to endless oceans, South Africa is\
  \ almost certainly one of the southern hemispheres greatest gifts. \n\nWhile many\
  \ people have a basic understanding of its history, far too few really understand\
  \ how deeply its scars run. Like the mountain ranges and cascading rivers that cut\
  \ through its land, emotional, political and historical scars appear on its people.\
  \ The most apparent of those is apartheid. Having only been abolished in 1991, apartheid\
  \ is still a regime that many of us will remember. And for those in southern Africa\
  \ it is all one which they feel to be very real. From the far reaching arms of Khayelitsha,\
  \ Cape Town's largest shanty town, to the famous township of Soweto in Johannesburg,\
  \ the struggle for life is as clear as day. From corruption , to crime and to a\
  \ lack of basic infrastructure, the beauty of South Africa shrouds its own wounds.\
  \ \n\nYet, despite the inconceivable hardships that many South Africans faced and\
  \ still face to this very day, appears a cultural the expresses so much happiness\
  \ and love. Even though people warned me that South Africa is dangerous and I should\
  \ be very wary being a female travelling by herself, I have never felt more welcomed\
  \ by a countries poeple. The last thing I expected to find in South Africa was a\
  \ culture so willing to share, even though they had so little to give, so happy\
  \ to help, when really they could do with an extra pair of hands and so enthusiastic\
  \ despite the adversity they face everyday. It is a country that shows the true\
  \ resilience of humanity. From the woman's shelter I volunteered in to the soup\
  \ kitchens on the street, South Africans showcase a remarkable level of empathy\
  \ and love towards one another which resembles exactly that of the eternal love\
  \ of a mother. \n\n\"Your ordinary acts of love and hope point to the extraordinary\
  \ promise that every human life is of inestimable value.\" Desmond Tutu"
