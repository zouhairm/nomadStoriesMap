Text: "It started as soon as I stepped off the plane - my passport was back in London.\
  \ And yet I\u2019d somehow managed to travel from Heathrow to Denver. Of course\
  \ it helps being air crew when all you have to do is show your ID, but how could\
  \ I have been so stupid! The only thing for it was to try my luck. I stepped up\
  \ to the customs lady and explained my sorry tale. She looked at me in disbelief\
  \ as to how a person could be so foolish - she had obviously never experienced jetlag.\
  \ She explained my options - pay a $1,000 fine or fly home to have my visa withdrawn.\
  \ Both options weren\u2019t possible.\n\nSeeing the dilemma written all over my\
  \ face she decided to help me. After pulling a few strings I was sat in the immigration\
  \ detention centre waiting to get into America. I couldn\u2019t believe my luck!\
  \ Although I soon realised this wasn\u2019t a place where one felt lucky. I was\
  \ surrounded by people trying to illegally sneak into the USA. Many just wanted\
  \ to live the American dream, but as the evening dragged on I learnt I was sat amongst\
  \ convicts, bigamists and even child abusers! Suddenly the thought of being on the\
  \ flight home where I was to be handed my P45 upon landing didn't seem so bad! I\
  \ started to become very aware that people were staring at me. I certainly didn\u2019\
  t look like I belonged there, but the uniform and little hat perched atop my head\
  \ were making it worse! I desperately looked around to find somewhere I could hide.\
  \ Luckily I noticed a small screen and hurried over. \n\nI was surprised to find\
  \ someone had beaten me to it as a man sat there looking as out of place as I did.\
  \ I whispered if I could hide alongside him and he motioned to a chair next to him.\
  \ The man was very handsome, rugged, with an intelligent air about him. After exchanging\
  \ stories I learnt that he had come from Spain as a mature student, but the authorities\
  \ weren\u2019t convinced due to his age. After 4 hours, a shared kit kat and a game\
  \ of eye spy we had fully covered our life stories. I was called to the desk, asked\
  \ a few questions and then ushered through a gate to be let into the Country. I\
  \ should have been relieved, but I all I could think about was the man behind the\
  \ screen and how sad I felt knowing I\u2019d never see him again.\n\n24 hours passed\
  \ and it was time to fly home. I was helping an elderly person with her bag when\
  \ I felt someone tap my shoulder. I turned around and it was him! He remembered\
  \ I was flying home that day and bought a ticket just so we could meet again. We\u2019\
  ve been inseparable ever since."
