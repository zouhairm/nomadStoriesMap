Text: "It's\u2019 4 p.m. This time is the busiest of the day. All around me are people\
  \ walking with, determined and daring footsteps, avoiding the crowd of tourists\
  \ taking selfies in front of the big cathedral. Camera flashes send little fires\
  \ of light into the crisp air and a parade of colorful umbrellas reflect them like\
  \ shadowed mirrors through space.  Drown into this human tide; all I can focus on\
  \ is the oddly satisfying smell of roasted nuts in the air and the uplifting urge\
  \ to get to Karlplatz already. Likely, Marienplatz is one of those rare places that\
  \ get more soothing with every time you wander around. \n4:10 already. I stop to\
  \ get a butter pretzel. I am about to step into Karlsplatz from Marienplatz when\
  \ I hear it again. It's Hartz, playing his white and blue-shaded guitar, same spot,\
  \ same time.It's 4: 14 so he's playing \"Hold Back the River\". It's always \"Hold\
  \ Back the River\" at 4:14. That's just the way it is with Hartz. I step in and\
  \ throw fifty cents into his rebel pot. That's just the way it is with me. \n4:20\
  \ at last. I step into Localz and it's really filled with bodies and something that\
  \ resembles a canvas of smiles on faces. I sat at the bar and enjoyed my view: Three\
  \ dozen of people somewhere between laughing and stating big facts while holding\
  \ tight to their glasses of Weinstephaner beer. Hung above all are colorful dots\
  \ of lights: Fairy lights, echoes from a muffled warm childhood. Saving me from\
  \ creepy nostalgia is the cracking sound of the door behind the counter smashed\
  \ against rough wood.  A couple of customers at the bar send out gasped cheers.\
  \ Then I hear the unmistakable \"Servus Ya Kamar\".Aaron is here and alive.Aaron\
  \ is Haroun Ahmed. And Haroun is a Syrian refugee. \n For the three weeks I have\
  \ been in Munich, I have been coming to this bar and helping Haroun with his English.\
  \ Next week, he is going for three job interviews. He is a software developer and\
  \ a former soldier in the Syrian Civilian Army.While he serves bubbly fire-blazed\
  \ cocktails, we converse in English. I tell him about Moroccan couscous and he tells\
  \ me about how his brother, Hussein, got shot right in the head and how blood, intertwining\
  \ with a squishy black substance, have painted scarlet red the bunch of pebbles\
  \ sitting on the ground. And he describes it all in a near perfect English. I tell\
  \ him I am proud of him.Only at this point, I am not sure whether it's the English\
  \ I am proud of or the tale of survival.I keep returning to him every day, 4:20\
  \ p.m., to find out."
