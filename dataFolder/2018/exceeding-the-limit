Text: "Exceeding the limit\n\nEvery human being in their childhood is a dreamer, a\
  \ traveller and a nomad but only few take the courage to pursue it for a lifetime.A\
  \ person like me who thinks twice before stepping out of my own house to a coffee\
  \ shop but without thinking twice said \u2018yes\u2019 to a trip on a stranger\u2019\
  s email proved that somewhere a nomad is hidden in me. The only travel memory from\
  \ my childhood is whenever I travelled to new places I wrote it down in my diary\
  \ entry and when those memories I read now it brings smile in my face. One fine\
  \ day I watched a new movie and gave a review through twitter. On the next day I\
  \ got an alert of winning a contest for that review. Then consequently, I won 200+\
  \ contests. The turning point was one day I got a message from Kurkure of winning\
  \ Kurkure Express Contest. The prize I got was a chance to travel with family on\
  \ full paid expense to Chennai.  To claim my prize without wasting a minute to think\
  \  I said \u201CYes\u201D. \n\nHappiness never comes for free even it seems so.\
  \ My travel was next month and it was my final semester of Engineering. When everyone\
  \ else was busy for placement and major project I was planning my travel. On the\
  \ day of my journey I have submitted my final year project and reached just 10 minutes\
  \ before the arrival of our cab to airport. From Bhopal I went to Mumbai and from\
  \ Panvel Station I boarded the Kurkure Express Train. It was literally a dream train\
  \ because with us on the train was the famous food traveller Rocky and Mayur, actor\
  \ Boman Irani and writer Anuja Chauhan. When we reached Chennai, for the next day\
  \ sight seeing was scheduled. First place we went to see was Marina beach,the world\u2019\
  s longest beach which I have only read in books. I walked around half an hour towards\
  \ the Madras Light House located near Marina beach . Then they took us to the nearby\
  \ MGR Memorial. I saw many people crying and praying near the tomb of  M.G.R. Later\
  \ we went to Express Avenue mall for shopping. Then we returned back to our hotel\
  \ as some election campaign was going on. Even though I just visited 4 places in\
  \ that trip I would still say it was one of my best trips. The amazing part was\
  \ my exam result because I was the topper of Computer Science department.\n\nThe\
  \ decision of going to this trip really dragged me to the edge of choosing my exams\
  \ or the trip. But my stubborn attitude let me win both the journey and my exam.\
  \ Moments like this which we take out from our mundane life are the moments we cherish\
  \ for the lifetime."
