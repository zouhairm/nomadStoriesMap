Text: "You just finished school. You tortured your brain for the past six months to\
  \ get good scores. And now your free. What do you do with your life?\n\nFor me it\
  \ was time to do something new and exciting \u2013 so I went abroad. Since my sister\
  \ just moved to Melbourne this was the place to go. She was living with her then-not-yet-and-now-not-anymore\
  \ husband in a small house at the outer suburbs. For a young graduate like me not\
  \ a very exciting place. I needed to get a job in the city. Now there is always\
  \ waiting tables, but to be honest: I\u2019m kind of clumsy. Sorting my skillset,\
  \ I decided to apply for a job in marketing. To my own surprise, it was pretty easy.\
  \ One application = one job interview. That was a perfect start \u2013 so I thought.\n\
  \nThe jobinterview started with an all-morning-kickstart-meeting in which we, eight\
  \ newies and the existing team, stood together in a circle. One by one the employees\
  \ were invited to step into the center. The team leader then announced all their\
  \ successes of the last day and we all applauded. At this point it already felt\
  \ a little strange. But what could be wrong with a little appreciation for good\
  \ work, right?\n\nThe circle was followed by a seminar for the new-joiners explaining\
  \ the \u201CSuccess-Levels\u201D. It didn\u2019t make the scary feeling go away.\
  \ Then every newie got a mate to work with this first day. Well, an unpaid training\
  \ day to get a job is not unusual these days, is it?\n\nNow, before I got a in a\
  \ car with a total stranger I used a short break to talk to my matched mate. She\
  \ told me that basically, the job was: Going into shops and selling stuff. At least\
  \ it was businesses and not private people in their homes, so this must be serious,\
  \ mustn\u2019t it?\n\nMy match explained to me: \"It is easy at first, when they\
  \ give you the good tours. But it gets harder to reach your daily goals when you\
  \ are send to rural areas with nearly no shops. That\u2019s when you start to work\
  \ overtime to do enough sales to make a basic salary just to survive the week.\"\
  \ At this point it sure looked suspicious to me. I excused myself and quietly baled.\
  \ At home I started googling the company. It turned out to be a doorstep brigade\
  \ \u2013 although well hidden. I read stories of people trying to get out, but the\
  \ company made it nearly impossible by taking away their passport. \n\nDuring my\
  \ travels I got some jobs and met some people but no encounter was as bizarre as\
  \ this first connection with the locals in Melbourne \u2013 not even the strip club.\
  \ But that\u2019s a story for another time."
