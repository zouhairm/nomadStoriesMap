Text: "Lessons in Happiness\n\nWhen was the last time you greeted a total stranger\
  \ \u2018Good morning\u2019? In the East, we don\u2019t do greetings too well unless\
  \ it is a compulsion. So what happens when you go to a place and find happy, smiling\
  \ faces ready to greet you? Living in a metro city, my definition to happiness was\
  \ limited to money, shopping and parties. But when you see people content with minimum\
  \ resources and in an exile, that\u2019s when you know what happiness is. \n\nMcLeodganj,\
  \ a sleepy town in the Himalayas is the first step in knowing Buddhist culture.\
  \ I wonder if in 1959, when HH the Dalai Lama found shelter in Dharamsala from China\u2019\
  s occupation of Tibet, anyone would\u2019ve thought that Tibet will sustain its\
  \ culture of Tibetan Buddhism. Known as the Little Lhasa, McLeodganj made me proud\
  \ of my country for supporting a culture that could\u2019ve been long dead. The\
  \ museum plays videos of thousands of Tibetans self-immolating themselves in Tibet\
  \ to protest against China. And then you come out and see their fellow citizens\
  \ roaming around in peace. How hard is it to be happy when you know your people\
  \ back there are suffering? How hard is it to be happy in a land that is not your\
  \ own? Their condition makes me wonder that happiness does not come from an \u2018\
  On sale\u2019 placard in a mall. \n\u201CHave you been to Ladakh?,\u201D asked one\
  \ of the monks at the Dalai Lama Temple. It\u2019s debating hour and the monks are\
  \ animatedly clapping and talking in what sounds like the Bodhi language. Before\
  \ I could answer, he tells me, \u201CI go there every year but right now it is too\
  \ cold and rainy.\u201D He goes on to ask me if I like 'his' town and I can\u2019\
  t help but smile when he calls an exile his own. \nI am amused to see the cafes\
  \ being frequented by monks and nuns but gradually became accustomed to their presence.\
  \ \u2018Free Tibet\u2019 is the universal mantra, plastered on flags and as art\
  \ on the walls. A walk towards the Main Square takes me through the prayer bells\
  \ and I continue walking through the mist floating in the pleasant air, greeting\
  \ smiling faces that look at me. My eyes search for deep reds as I trek my way to\
  \ Triund. And as I sit there on a stone scribbling notes in my diary, I see three\
  \ monks making their way to a higher altitude clicking pictures of each other. They\
  \ sit on one of the rocks watching the sunset while I capture one in my phone only\
  \ to realise that it is the nature that binds us all together."
