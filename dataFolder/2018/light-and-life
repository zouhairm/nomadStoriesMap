Text: "On the banks of Musi, the deccan tributary to the river Krishna, the Chaderghat\
  \ bridge is packed with Hyderabad\u2019s traffic. It is 7 PM and the bridge is studded\
  \ with multi-coloured lights of vehicles commuting in and out of the suburbs. But\
  \ there\u2019s one light that stands humbly alone, perched on a makeshift stand\
  \ on one side of the bridge. It has a bright bulb of yellowish light that penetrates\
  \ through thin glass. It casts a soft beam onto rows of jasmine garlands (with an\
  \ aroma that can\u2019t be found elsewhere in the city) neatly arranged on an inclined\
  \ stand. The flower-seller\u2019s voice seldom goes unheard. Although, as if stirring\
  \ every sense, the Musi whiffs an unpleasant odour. A consequence of pollution.\n\
  Why do they sell these jasmines here? Is it as a mask to the deep stench or as a\
  \ resistance to it or is it merely a coincidence? What is their story?\nOne day,\
  \ I found myself walking up to one of those stands to find out. After I bought one\
  \ mura of flowers for 20 rupees, Saleem and Awaiz, the two kids at the stand, answered\
  \ my questions a little curiously and confidently. In their homes, every day, a\
  \ member of the family fetches flowers from the wholesale flower market, a fourth\
  \ of a kilogram for 200 rupees, and the household occupies itself in making garlands.\
  \ Later, just as the sky is turning mild orange, the seller sets up his stand, places\
  \ the lantern in its spot, arranges garlands and begins his trade for livelihood\
  \ in the growing city.\n\nSameer, who sold flowers since he was eight years old\
  \ told me that his family makes a profit of around 500 rupees a day to provide for\
  \ seven. I asked him how they could stand the foul smell. \u2018Lagathe lagathe\
  \ aadat hogaya(It has become habitual now)\u2019, he said. \nAs I started walking\
  \ back after taking my notes, Saleem tailed me, asking me in a distinguished Deccani\
  \ accent, \u2018Madam, aap kaiku likhre yeh sab?\u2019 (Why are you writing all\
  \ this down?) pointing at my notebook. I was lost in thought. Why exactly did this\
  \ story matter to me?\nI told him I was writing a story about the bridge, but I\
  \ knew my story wasn\u2019t complete. In Saleem\u2019s candid reply, \u2018Kuch\
  \ bhi ban sakte\u2019 (I/You can be anything you want) when I asked him who he wanted\
  \ to be when he grew up, I saw a fearless encounter with life. I had gone out to\
  \ that bridge to find some answers, and more questions arose. I was in a constant\
  \ battle of finding meaning of the incomprehensible binds that tied me, and Saleem\
  \ was free, and would always be.\n\n(From my blog, Street Story)"
