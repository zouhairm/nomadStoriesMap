Text: "\u201CI need to be clear so you know what's ahead; the facilities are very\
  \ basic, and you may not see another trekker\u201D. Here I am standing in the lobby\
  \ of a guest house - which is suddenly as quiet as a library - convincing a Nepalese\
  \ guide I\u2019m prepared for the trek he\u2019s leading through the Annapurna Conservation\
  \ Area, Nepal. I\u2019m elated; un-populated and basic add to the excitement. \n\
  \nBeginning in Pokhara, we navigate through the hills to a trail entrance. It\u2019\
  s a wide track leading to Yangakot village and where I first observe inhabitant\
  \ dynamic, which is further mimicked in upcoming days. Over the stove a teen dutifully\
  \ prepares our meal while her mother socialises with their guests; Female chores\
  \ appear limited to kitchen duties, while men complete those requiring greater strength.\n\
  \nIn the village of Siklis I watch an elderly man stomp a wool blanket with his\
  \ feet in place of a tumble dryer; the effort is acutely noticeable. While resting\
  \ between Siklis and Tanting we overlook a farmer ploughing his field. His water\
  \ buffalo disobediently pull a bamboo plough behind and his loud commands are a\
  \ tell-tale sign of the strenuous work involved.Wonders of local village aside,\
  \ it is the landscape that impresses most.\n\nThe terrain changes daily making it\
  \ clear the distance covered over the days. After lunch on the first, our surroundings\
  \ change from wide dirt road, into relentless inclines. Day two leads us along a\
  \ narrow track, towards a gloriously engineered swing bridge crossing a river. Our\
  \ third day takes us deep into woodland with cooler temperatures and damp foliage.\
  \ Here the track is dirt and we walk beneath towering canopies.The fourth day presents\
  \ the greatest challenge as we move through forest laden with hungry leeches. It\u2019\
  s impossible to avoid their grasp irrespective of the speed we travel, and at one\
  \ point my patience is tested when I remove sixteen from my socks. Four hours walking\
  \ brings us to our vantage point of Tara Top at 2800m. Famed for offering 360 degree\
  \ views of the Annapurna region, fog is the champion today with only glimpses of\
  \ the Tibetan prayer flags close by. It is here I elect to adjoin two days\u2019\
  \ into one, and we begin descending down the valley.\n\nI take note of my surroundings\
  \ one final time, reflecting on the days before. From elderly man stomping water,\
  \ and farmer herding buffalo - hard working, enduring, humble, and welcoming - perhaps\
  \ it is the people who create the region, and not nature after all?"
