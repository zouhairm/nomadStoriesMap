Text: "The only thing I see is the ground. \nI have enough time to explore the little\
  \ rocks that lie beneath me \u2013 some granite mixed with quartz that shines like\
  \ glitter on a birthday crown.\nA drop of sweat runs down my forehead to the tip\
  \ of my nose. I can't wipe it off because moving would cause a bigger punishment\
  \ for my unit.\n My eyes are resting on some clay, and something I recognize as\
  \ Nubian sandstone.\nLooking up, I see my sergeant's boots move from the beginning\
  \ of the line we are forming to the end of it, waiting for someone to break. Meanwhile,\
  \ the drop finds its way from my nose to the ground, combining with the sand and\
  \ slowly disappearing. \n\nMy travel buddies ask the regular questions. I know I'm\
  \ a woman, but army service is compulsory to all in my country. No, I didn\u2019\
  t kill anyone. Yes, I enjoyed it. \n\nThis story is much more bearable when I'm\
  \ sipping a cold beer on a cliff in a blooming park, in this sunny day with new\
  \ people and the view of the whole city of Johannesburg. I'm so relaxed that I almost\
  \ forgot that just like Cinderella; I have to be at my hostel by sunset, because\
  \ \"you don't wander around in the dark in one of the most dangerous cities in the\
  \ world\". \n\nWe heard music coming from the far end of the park. One of guys I\
  \ was with joined me to explore, we left our belongings with the others.\nAs we\
  \ approached the sound, we saw a big singing and dancing crowd, wearing white cloth\
  \ and huge smiles on their faces. It looked like a big celebration of happiness\
  \ and music. We didn\u2019t know if we're allowed to join but a man who came to\
  \ shake our hands confirmed that we are.\"It's a Sunday celebration of god and new\
  \ beginnings\", he said. A girl gave me a maroon piece of fabric to dance with,\
  \ and led me to the women's circle, where I was welcomed joyously - even though\
  \ I struggled to keep up with the dance.\n\nWhen we came back to the cold beer,\
  \ we received much less warmth.\nOur friends were agitated and urged us to go as\
  \ quick as possible. It turned out that less than 500 meters from the festive environment,\
  \ an armed man commanded our friend to lie on the ground and took everything he\
  \ could from our bags.\nSurprisingly, he left some coins in my wallet, a deed that\
  \ gave him the title \"The Nice Thief From Joburg\".\n I wondered whether our friends\
  \ discovered which kind of sedimentary rock they were lying on, but after they mentioned\
  \ that the only time they needed someone with an army training \u2013 I was gone,\
  \ I decided to keep the thought to myself."
