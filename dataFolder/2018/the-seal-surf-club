Text: "In the room of our modest yoga villa in Ol\xF3n, I riffle through a half-packed\
  \ suitcase for something that might be kind to the brutal burn I've been handed\
  \ by the strong Ecuadorian sun. A twinge of sadness passes at the thought of leaving\
  \ here in less than ten hours. I hear a familiar banter as Vickie negotiates with\
  \ our host over the music selection, like countless nights spent in her Miami backyard.\
  \ He's become accustomed to our late-night dance parties, and perhaps intrusive\
  \ insistence of his participation, yet he remains patient waiting for his turn.\
  \ I join them outside, adjusting the sundress I have settled on for New Year's Eve.\
  \ \n\nRoey greets me in his gargled Israeli accent, \"You look beautiful!\" His\
  \ ordinarily wild coiled hair and unmanaged beard are trimmed and tamed. His usual\
  \ uniform of board shorts and rash guard replaced for jeans and a button down. It\
  \ occurs to me that this is the first time I've worn makeup since arriving here.\
  \ Simon arrives in typical fashion, his weathered face buried in his phone as if\
  \ attending to important business, with a walk much taller than his diminutive stature,\
  \ and undoubtedly judging Vickie's song choice. My phone buzzes with a message from\
  \ the \"Seals,\" a local group chat we've been added to, \"Pick up some rum on your\
  \ way!\"\nIts nearly midnight and I begin gathering those I've grown close to in\
  \ this sleepy surf town, checking them off an imaginary list; Vickie, Roey, Simon,\
  \ Danielle, Elba, Juan. \n\nThe heat from massive bonfires warms the vast stretch\
  \ of beach we've been attempting to conquer on our surfboards since we arrived.\
  \ Young boys who've been haunting the streets are fueling the fire with oversized\
  \ Papier-m\xE2ch\xE9 effigies of various characters. As is custom in Ecuador, men\
  \ and boys dress as widows to beg for money and candy leading up to New Year. Locals\
  \ burn symbols of the past clearing the way for the coming year, hoping to leave\
  \ the previous behind. I watch as a wooly mammoth gets tossed in. \n\nSurfers rush\
  \ out to the dark water, counting down from behind the break, awaiting the first\
  \ wave of the new year. Another friendly face, Orlando, waves as he zips past me,\
  \ barely recognizable absent the zinc-oxide face paint and Oakley's. \n\nLooking\
  \ around, I'm struck by the feeling that I've been here many times before. This\
  \ place, these people, all strikingly familiar, yet not long ago both foreign. I\
  \ remember our first day, when a parting guest smiled and said, \"By the time you\
  \ leave, you'll be part of the town.\""
