Text: "I slowly inched my way to the edge of the cliff, my legs feeling like they\
  \ were going to give way at any moment. Tears flowed down my face as my heart raced\
  \ and I tried desperately to catch my breath.  \n\n\u201CYou don\u2019t have to\
  \ do this,\u201D Sunjatha said, as she wrapped her arm around me, consoling me.\
  \  \n\n\n\u201CNo, I don\u2019t,\u201D I thought to myself, as I intentionally looked\
  \ away from the edge. My fear of heights had never been so real.  \n\n\u201CYou\u2019\
  ll be fine. You\u2019re going to do great!\u201D David told me, a big grin on his\
  \ face as he hooked the ropes to my harness. \n\nWhen I came to India to volunteer\
  \ at an anti-trafficking NGO, I didn\u2019t know that would mean a staff retreat\
  \ in the jungle, participating in team building exercises -- like rappelling off\
  \ a 60-foot rock. I don\u2019t even like the escalator at the shopping mall! \n\n\
  From the time I knew about this retreat two months earlier, my mind was made up:\
  \ \n\n\u201CThere is no way I\u2019m abseiling.\u201D \n\u201CThis is not what I\
  \ signed up for.\u201D \n\u201CNot doing it. You can\u2019t make me.\u201D \n\n\
  I sounded more like a two-year-old having a temper tantrum than a 42-year-old woman.\
  \ But now, here I was, standing on the edge of a cliff with the ground looming 60\
  \ feet below. \n\nNo, I didn\u2019t have to do this, but I knew if I backed down,\
  \ I would regret it. I would regret letting fear win.  \n\nAs David finished hooking\
  \ me up and Sunjatha continued to console me, I took a deep breath and through quivering\
  \ lips and a shaky voice said, \u201CYes, I have to do this.\u201D \n\nSlowly I\
  \ began to inch myself backwards, lowering myself into a sitting position in the\
  \ harness, as my legs pushed me out and I became vertical with the face of the cliff.\
  \ I kept telling myself, \u201CJust don\u2019t look down.\u201D \n\nAs I descended,\
  \ David yelled out commands and words of encouragement. \n\n\u201CKeep your legs\
  \ wide!\u201D \u201CYou got this!\u201D \u201CYou\u2019re doing great!\u201D  \n\
  \nSoon my weak legs became strong, the tears ended, and the fear subsided.\n \n\
  Halfway down I surprised myself when I stopped to take in my surroundings -- and\
  \ decided to look down. As I dangled 30 feet in the air, I saw my co-workers below,\
  \ their smiles beaming up at me and the sound of their cheers echoing through the\
  \ trees.  \n\nMoments later I reached the bottom. With a huge grin splashed across\
  \ my face, I gave my team a thumbs up.\n\nI came to India to make a difference,\
  \ but it is India that has changed me. This beautiful and chaotic country doesn\u2019\
  t allow you to forget your problems -- it gives you what you need to face them."
