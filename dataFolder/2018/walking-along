Text: "The white washed Kanchengdzonga peaks glistened in the morning sunlight.The\
  \ whole setting makes you feel assured to encounter a White Walker in the dense\
  \ white carpet of snow.I could see the hustle and bustle of people downstairs from\
  \ my hotel window.It was 5 in the morning.Elsewhere you wouldn't expect this, but\
  \ here I was in Pelling, Sikkim where it is pitch dark at 6 in the evening.\n\n\
  I was to see Vinitha, a victim of drug abuse.Accompanied by Kenzho, a 10-year old\
  \ leaving for school,we started walking down the mountain.From the dark green mountains\
  \ in the vicinity,to the pale green ferns in the warmth of the sunlight,I could\
  \ see 50 shades of green.There was no sight of land visible from the top except\
  \ the \npatches of road all along the way.Rocks and house-roofs covered with algae.We\
  \ walked through the fog surrounding the mountains and the sunlight peeping through\
  \ Pine trees.Squirrels and Leeches passed us through the narrow soiled roads.\n\n\
  Kenzho carried no bag with him.He said he must take it only once a week.He and all\
  \ the children from the remote villages walked for 10-12 kilometres everyday to\
  \ and from school.With the frequent weather changes and dangerous commute, life\
  \ is hard for people here.Yet, Sikkim has a high literacy rate.With patches of cultivated\
  \ land all around, its the only state to have adopted organic farming all over.\n\
  \n\"Cleanliness is in our culture\",he says.As we are about to reach our destination,\
  \ Kenzho points out to a Monastery in the vicinity. In this open-defecation free\
  \ state, I see colored flags all around.\"They represent peace and humbleness\"\
  .\n\nClouds surround the distant mountains,and fog around us.Its possible to tell\
  \ both are a class apart.This place has warm sunlight touching our skin and rainfall\
  \ leading us to waterfalls.Such contrasting weather and such contrasting situations\
  \ keep me wondering about the economic and social circumstances in this area.Drugs,\
  \ Suicides, Suicide attempts being prominent in the recent times. Kenzho bids me\
  \ goodbye and walks along playing hide-n-seek with his friends.And as I see the\
  \ clouds playing hide-n-seek with the mountains, I reach Vinitha's place."
