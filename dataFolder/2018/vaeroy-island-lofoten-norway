Text: "Vaeroy island - is a small island, lost on the outskirts of the Lofoten archipelago,\
  \ surrounded on all sides by cold waters of the Atlantic Ocean. Here do not go crowds\
  \ of tourists and local people here not every day can be found on the street, but\
  \ nevertheless he is fantastically beautiful!\nThe Norwegians call this island the\
  \ \"Sleeping Dragon\", and really, looking from the highest point of the island\
  \ down, that this is not an island at all, but a real, fire-breathing, sleeping\
  \ giant.\nAfter we traveled all over the center of Norway, with its popular sights\
  \ such as \"Trolltunga\", Bergen, S\xF6gnefjord and much more ... Our path continued\
  \ to Lofoten.\nFrom Bergen, the easiest way to get there by plane is to Bodo, and\
  \ from there a 5 hour ferry directly to the island (do not forget check the ferry\
  \ schedule in advance).\nThe ferry moored around 20:00 and the first night we spent\
  \ the night in the Vaeroy Brygge hotel ($ 150 / night).\nEarly in the morning, having\
  \ collected a backpack with everything necessary (tent, sleeping bag, food and water)\
  \ we went on a trip!\nThe weather was lousy, there was a fine rain, and all the\
  \ mountains hid in the clouds, but this only added mystery to the fairy-tale landscapes,\
  \ we headed to the top of Mount Heya, to the meteorological station, the local said\
  \ that there is the best view. The meteorological station can be reached only on\
  \ foot, the route is about 6 kilometers, all the way up the slope, the road looks\
  \ as \"Trollstigen\", very wagging, but even despite the rain and fog, the view\
  \ opens incredibly beautiful. After 40 minutes I began to understand that the whole\
  \ peak in the fog and this famous view from the Internet, I do not see when the\
  \ wind threw the fog aside, and the city was bare before the camera's eyes for 2-3\
  \ minutes, I quickly ran into the abyss and managed to do a couple of photos, but\
  \ when we got to the top, there the fog was so thick that the wind could not cope\
  \ with it, waiting for 3 hours under a downpour, wind and terrible cold, I realized\
  \ that the fog will not disappear, and making a couple of photos in a blinding fog\
  \ we decided to leave ...\nFurther it was decided to go through the ridge to another\
  \ part of the island to look for Puffins.\nBecause of the rain, the land on the\
  \ road became very slippery, we climbed up the mountain with practically no problems,\
  \ although the road was very narrow, and the mountain is high, step to the right,\
  \ step to the left, a precipice ... a abyss of 200 meters!\nTo be continued..."
