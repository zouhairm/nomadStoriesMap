Text: "About a decade back, my cousin and I had escaped the tumultuous metro of Tokyo\
  \ to find peace on the Yuigahama Beach of Kamakura. At our pleasure were the warm\
  \ Pacific waters, a humidity-relieving breeze, and the picturesque Mount Fuji in\
  \ the distance. The perfect scene still felt imperfect. \n\nThe incongruent view\
  \ of a snowy peak from a sunny beach ignited a flash in our minds. We decided to\
  \ climb the mountain to see the sun proclaim a new day to the world. We decided\
  \ to seek adventure.\n\nBy nightfall, we had arrived at the base station where rangers\
  \ blocked our entrance. They questioned our preparation--which was lacking. We persisted.\
  \ They insisted. Their resistance eventually faded. They offered a flashlight and\
  \ water. From there our resolve alone dictated our success.\n\nThe sight of seniors\
  \ on the trail boosted our youthful arrogance, quickened our pace. We sprung from\
  \ rocks off the trail to rush around hikers. The eager pace did not last. \n\nWithin\
  \ a few hours our reckless vigor was drained. The beam of our flashlight trudging\
  \ ahead of us slowed down. We had consumed the little food we carried. The bottle\
  \ of water empty. The downward temperature swoop had us shivering. My cousin in\
  \ a light windbreaker; myself in a hoodie. Our misfortune would worsen.\n\nThe storm\
  \ wings of tropical cyclone Etau swept over Fuji. We were deluged with cold rain\
  \ and gusts. Rain had seeped through my sneakers. My hoodie became soaked. My energy\
  \ depleted. My stamina faltered. \n\nI dropped down against a rock with my knees\
  \ bent to my chin. I desperately clung to my legs. I thought no one would rescue\
  \ me. I was too exhausted to panic. Fainting felt appealing. \n\nOver the next few\
  \ hours of wavering consciousness, we alternated motivating each other to keep moving.\
  \ We managed to arrive at a rest point where we bought chocolate and sodas. The\
  \ invigorating sugar was life-saving; it carried us to our goal.\n\nWe punctually\
  \ reached the mountain top to witness the dawn rays as the sun crashed through the\
  \ clouds. Swigs from whiskey nips--those little airplane bottles, crowned our celebration.\
  \ Forgetting the world below us, we simply enjoyed the moment. Delirium smoothed\
  \ my downhill stumble while I reflected on our mini quest.\n\nFor one day, we rejected\
  \ the world of bubble-wrapped tourism. We snubbed the safe and boring, and invited\
  \ risk. A decisive impetus led us to confront the dangers of nature and test our\
  \ mettle. Yet, we overcame, climbed Mount Fuji and clutched a memorable adventure."
