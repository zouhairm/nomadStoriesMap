Text: "I heard a tap tap tap on the door of our suite shortly after the bellman had\
  \ delivered our bags. Upon opening the door I was greeted by a nattily attired gentleman\
  \ holding an ice bucket containing a bottle of champagne. His contagious smile and\
  \ soft spoken voice said \u201CWelcome, I am Rafael, your butler, I am here to make\
  \ your stay as enjoyable and stress free as possible. I will help you make dinner\
  \ reservations, keep your mini bar refilled, help with housekeeping scheduling,\
  \ and any other services you may require.\u201D His voice and manner seemed sincere,\
  \ deliberate and delivered with compassion. My fianc\xE9 and I have stayed at several\
  \ resorts in the past that provided a butler. Usually you saw them the first day\
  \ and not often thereafter. But we knew immediately that Rafael was a true artisan\
  \ of the art, much like those seen in English shows and movies. \nWe were tired\
  \ from the flight, the trek through local customs, and shuttle trip to our hotel\
  \ in this beautiful tropical island country of Dominican Republic. Other times we\
  \ would have hurriedly dispatched of this type of distraction\u2026but something\
  \ about Rafael kept us enthralled and helped dissipate the weariness in our bodies.\
  \ We immediately fell in love with this man, with his beautiful smile and personality.\
  \ We knew we had been assigned the best butler at the resort. He quickly showed\
  \ us around our suite, and from our balcony pointed out all the amenities of the\
  \ hotel. He had great command of the English language, and his delivery contained\
  \ the easy flowing accent of his native Spanish tongue. It was such a pleasure to\
  \ listen to him. His visit was polite, concise, to the point, and very professional.\
  \ Before leaving, he popped open the champagne, poured some in our provided flutes,\
  \ wrote down his direct extension, and cheerily said to call if we needed anything.\n\
  Our week in Punta Cana was wonderful from many respects. Needless to say Rafael\
  \ set the tone for our stay, and faithfully delivered on all his duties as our butler.\
  \ We became friends. We learned about his wife and seven children, where he lived,\
  \ and his vision of visiting the United States with his wife one day. The day of\
  \ our departure Rafael handed me a piece of paper with his email address written\
  \ on it, and asked me to notify him when were safely back in Atlanta. I did as he\
  \ asked, and we have been corresponding ever since.\nFrom this marvelous connection\
  \ with this wonderful man, we are already planning a return trip next year."
