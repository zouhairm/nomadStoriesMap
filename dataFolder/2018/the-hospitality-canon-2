Text: "There I was again, in a crowded kitchen, drinking chacha, a homemade brandy,\
  \ with all too eager hosts. I had been living in Tsalenjikha, a rural town in the\
  \ country of Georgia and had been there long enough to know that Georgian hospitality\
  \ was like a canon which fired off with great intensity and little warning. \n\n\
  Prior to arrival, people had cautioned me about the potency of hospitality in Georgia\
  \ and how being a host is a highly privileged role. I brushed that aside as one\
  \ of those empty sentiments masquerading as national pride. However, as I learned,\
  \ it\u2019s not an empty sentiment and that Georgians genuinely relish hosting.\n\
  \nMy hosts on this afternoon were Ophelia, a no-nonsense widower, and a roomful\
  \ of her neighbors. Ophelia spent her days toiling in her expansive garden and some\
  \ of this season\u2019s yield \u2013 a tangy plum sauce, pickled green tomatoes,\
  \ a fresh salad - graced the table along with plates of sulguni, a salty cheese,\
  \ and homemade bread. As we ate, Ophelia commanded, \u201CChame, chame.\u201D Eat.\
  \ Eat.\n\nOphelia\u2019s son, Kahka, a news producer, refilled my glass and launched\
  \ into another heartfelt toast. Everyone bowed their heads and nodded in agreement.\
  \ Finally he announced bolomde or \u201Cto the bottom\u201D and we all drank. \n\
  \nFrom where I sat the window framed a view of the river that lazily meanders through\
  \ town. Lately, I had been thinking how life in Tsalenjikha seemed to flow at a\
  \ similar mellow speed. \n\nIn the frosty mornings I walked along a forested road\
  \ to the small schoolhouse. In the afternoons, I fetched water from the well and\
  \ helped in the garden. Families made wine from backyard grapes. Free roaming farm\
  \ animals rooting through the streets added to the bucolic vision. \n\nIn the evenings,\
  \ the dark-eyed and soulful people of Georgia gathered at the mill or in backyards.\
  \ With this pace of life, they made more time for each other, and the idea of community\
  \ seemed distilled down to its essence, as potent as the chacha Kakha continued\
  \ to pour from an ornate decanter. When it was time to celebrate life, they did\
  \ so with all of their hearts. This afternoon\u2019s revelry was testament to that.\
  \ \n\nWe finished one last round. Ophelia directed me towards a couch to recline\
  \ on in the television den. The chatter of foreign television washed over me like\
  \ a lullaby. A warmth was glowing behind my eyes and in my chest. If Georgian hospitality\
  \ were a canon, I had taken a direct hit, and it had left me reeling with new ideas\
  \ of what kindness and community were all about."
