Text: "Unless you\u2019ve been to the Taj Mahal you haven\u2019t traveled India someone\
  \ once told me. \u201CIf you go to India just for the Maj Mahal you haven\u2019\
  t experienced India.\u201D I replied. In my mind, there\u2019s a definitive line\
  \ between being a traveler and being a gatherer of experiences, the kind that\u2019\
  ll change your outlook on life. India bridged the gap between the two for me. Being\
  \ there affected me so much I wrote nothing about my time there. I couldn\u2019\
  t bring myself to write, as India is an experience which one needs time to reflect\
  \ upon before truly understanding it.\n\nIndia was one of those bucket list countries\
  \ for me, as I love everything about Indian culture from what I\u2019d experienced\
  \ at home in the U.S.A. \u2013 from the food to the clothes to the movies \u2013\
  \ it all drew me in. I knew before I arrived that India was defined by the stark\
  \ contrast between the wealthy and the poor, but nothing can prepare someone for\
  \ the destitution.\n\nFirst, the amount of physical disfigurements was something\
  \ I didn\u2019t know about and wasn\u2019t prepared for. Not just people missing\
  \ limbs, but people begging whose arms go backward instead frontwards, their lower\
  \ leg twists up instead of down, keeping their foot at their waist. Shoulders curve\
  \ backwards, elbows backwards, any kind of natural body position we don\u2019t ever\
  \ have to think about, there are so many people born differently. Different can\
  \ mean death in India.\n\nWhich brings me to my second point. The amount of homeless\
  \ people in Delhi is like nothing else. When you walk outside your hotel, there\u2019\
  s always more people than you can count sleeping outside. What really struck me\
  \ was why they were there. In the U.S., homelessness is attributed to addiction\
  \ or mental health issues. But in India, it\u2019s from clear rejection from birth.\
  \ The disfigurements in India are cause for family shame, so parents reject their\
  \ children. Not only are these children and adults dealing with the reality of their\
  \ physical challenge, but they\u2019re also rejected from society. They never get\
  \ a chance.\n\nMy greatest personal struggle was my desire to help but feeling useless.\
  \ The sheer volume of people alone makes it impossible to make any positive change\
  \ in their lives. I read once that the best thing you can do for homeless people,\
  \ if you can\u2019t donate or buy them a meal, is to acknowledge their presence\
  \ and say hello. They need all the help they can get, yes, but never did I expect\
  \ to travel to India and touch another human being\u2019s life with the simple word\
  \ hello."
