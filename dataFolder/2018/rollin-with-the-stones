Text: "No, this is not about a 1960s English rock band. My last name is Stone, and\
  \ at age 30, I am rollin' around the world for the first time.\n\nI spent my 20's\
  \ living in and out of NYC, while pursuing a career upon the wicked stage. When\
  \ I grew endlessly DONE with the unimpressive lifestyle of eating Easy-Mac three\
  \ times per day, and collecting seat cushion change to pay my NYC rent, my boyfriend-now-turned-husband\
  \ and I returned to our native hometown: Boston. We had never been on a vacation\
  \ together and after a long speech about missing out on travel opportunities while\
  \ pursuing the most unstable career of all time, I dragged him to the happiest place\
  \ on earth: Disney World! \n\nDevon had never been and didn't understand the hype,\
  \ that is, until he saw the flight of the macaws at the opening morning ceremony\
  \ at Animal Kingdom (as a side note, Devon truly prefers animals over humans. If\
  \ he could legally marry his cat, this would be an altogether different travel-tale).\
  \ Needless to say, Devon was reduced to a puddle of tears at the sight of the majestic\
  \ and colorful birds flying in tandem. His condition did not improve on the Safari\
  \ either. \n\nOur next stop was Epcot, and it was here that our travel dreams began.\
  \ At the time, we had decided that Epcot's Plastic Tower of Pisa was probably the\
  \ closest we'd get to a European excursion. We'd be lying if we denied that we walked\
  \ around the park immersing ourselves in the architecture, food, and fun that Disney\
  \ presented to us,  pathetically taking it all authentically at face value... \n\
  \nPost-Disney, we began collecting magnets of all the places we'd been! We had four\
  \ from Cape Cod, one from Salem, MA, and our sparkling new Disney magnet lined up\
  \ chronologically on our fridge. It was this VERY, VERY sad occurrence that led\
  \ us to the re-evaluation of our priorities. It suddenly became clear that our noble\
  \ pursuits of remaining starving artists for all eternity were the very things in\
  \ the way of us experiencing the wide world's offerings beyond our annual visits\
  \ to Cape Cod and the Plastic Eiffel Tower at Epcot. \n\nFortunately, Netflix was\
  \ able to help us get our daily fix of Rick Steves. Between his adorably awkward\
  \ antics with the locals and his savvy tips on saving money, we knew we were in\
  \ excellent hands. With his gentle guidance and silvery tones, in a 2-week period,\
  \ we were convinced that we were ready, and impulsively booked a trip ten months\
  \ out to Amsterdam. Thus, begins the start of  our adventure book..."
