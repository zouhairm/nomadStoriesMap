Text: "I've always been one who plays it safe. Sticks to the rules, never toes the\
  \ line, or even crosses the border beyond my comfort zone.  Life's sharp curve balls,\
  \ however, changed that and gave me memories I can reminisce for years to come.\
  \ \nAfter a particularly harrowing month, I called two of my closest friends and\
  \ told them, \"We're going for a road trip down Kerala's coast line in the last\
  \ week of December. Clear your schedule\". Lucky for me, they put everything aside,\
  \ no questions asked. Vacations until that moment had always been quite cliche -\
  \ the fancy hotels, multiple bags packed with completely unnecessary items, boring\
  \ days visiting all the major tourist attractions, and well, you get the drift.\
  \ I was determined that this trip, would stand apart from everything I had ever\
  \ done. I carried one backpack, comprising a towel, toothbrush, soap bar, two pairs\
  \ of shorts, three cotton t-shirts, two pairs of socks and a sleeping bag. We decided\
  \ not to book any hotels, and planned to find local hostels to stay nights. Another\
  \ major decision we took, was to not take the help of our friendly neighborhood\
  \ hero, Google Maps, and take the road as it comes. Bold decision, that. Metaphorically\
  \ blinded, we drove from Bengaluru to Kerala, in the wee hours of a fine Monday\
  \ morning, and I knew this was one of the best decisions I would ever make. Anyone\
  \ with a passion for travel will find their way towards 'God's Own Country'. The\
  \ journey was beautiful - on one side was sparkling blue water, inviting us in with\
  \ each wave, and on the other, bringing in a captivating contrast, was lush, dense\
  \ greenery, beautiful trees that seemed to whisper their own secrets. Relationships,\
  \ deadlines, life and death, ceased to exist in those moments. It was just me, in\
  \ that moment, and I loved every second of it. I realized that the life of comfort\
  \ I was living, was one of ignorance and illiteracy. We stopped to eat at small\
  \ places. Little kitchens that served delicious appam and stew, fish that melted\
  \ in my mouth, and beef loaded with dollops of incredible flavors; a genuine road\
  \ trip experience. \nMy reluctance to leave my comfort zone had led me to miss out\
  \ on some wonderful travel experiences, and I had had enough. The road trip was\
  \ exhilarating and frustrating, eye-opening and beat-down tiring, one I wouldn't\
  \ trade for anything in the world. My love for travel before Kerala was simply to\
  \ visit popular tourist destinations. Now, I aspire to find out what gives a place\
  \ its heart."
