Text: "The Chale Wote Street Art Festival is one of the biggest festivals in Africa.\
  \ As a travel enthusiast, I had heard so much about it and was eager to attend.\
  \ Could it be bigger than our Calabar Festival or the Lagos Countdown? Being Nigerian,\
  \ I have to regard everything Ghanaian through the lens of rivalry. Our jollof is\
  \ better than theirs, our dances are better than theirs and their pidgin doesn't\
  \ have the sweet rhythm of ours.\n\nI had thought about attending years ago but\
  \ the fear of solo travel held me behind. So when my friend indicated her interest\
  \ in travelling, it felt like the stars aligned on my behalf. We were going to travel\
  \ to Accra by road, explore places, confirm what we already knew about their jollof\
  \ and attend the festival.\n\nThe Chale Wote Festival was a lot different from the\
  \ festivals in Nigeria. It brought art, music, dance out into the streets. I was\
  \ eager to see how all the various art forms were going to be combined and the crowd\
  \ participation. We made reservations for an Airbnb and got the show on the road.\n\
  \nThe trip to Accra was long. It was a minibus and I sat in front where I had more\
  \ leg room compared to the people behind who had to sit like fish in a can of sardine.\
  \ Asides the exhausting border checks, the ride was peaceful and the scenery was\
  \ picturesque. We arrived late and tired to our cosy AirBnB. Over the course of\
  \ two days, we spent time touring the city and we soon discovered that Ghanaians\
  \ were just like Nigerians - happy and passionate about culture and tradition. \n\
  \nOn our third day, we attended the festival which had kicked off two days before.\
  \ Locals donned the most beautiful attires and the art on display could rival the\
  \ most prominent artworks. I wasn\u2019t the only tourist greedily soaking in everything.\
  \ Stalls selling local delicacies made sure to keep foodies occupied. All of this\
  \ was almost upstaged by the various musicians who played music from afrobeat to\
  \ highlife in the centre of the venue. Walking further revealed smaller groups of\
  \ people partying together and just having fun.\n\nNothing prepared me for the amount\
  \ of energy I saw in the hips of the locals as they gyrated against one another.\
  \ In a continent where homosexuality is painted as evil, the fluidity I witnessed\
  \ at the festival was a sight to behold and a breath of fresh air. \n\nIn conclusion,\
  \ the festival opened my eyes to culture, love and most surprising, freedom where\
  \ toxic masculinity and homophobia were shoved out before you came to Jamestown."
