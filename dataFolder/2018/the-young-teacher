Text: "I followed the line of children, trying my best not to step in a pot hole or\
  \ a pile of trash in my flip flops. The roads we walked through in this Kenyan village\
  \ were paved with dirt, rocks and loose trash. The road led through a neighborhood\
  \ packed with homes, stacked one next to the other, mismatched in a sunset of colors\
  \ and covered with metal rooftops.\nAs the hot air blew through the street, it warmed\
  \ my skin while spiraling dirt all over my face. The children were making their\
  \ journey home from school. This daily walk to and from school was more than a walk\
  \ for these children. It was a walk toward an education, an opportunity many children\
  \ in the village didn\u2019t have. I had been teaching these children for two short\
  \ weeks and, on my last day of teaching, my students wanted to show me their homes.\n\
  As I trailed behind, the children would occasionally turn around and smile\u2014\
  skipping through the street with excitement. The wide road turned into a narrow,\
  \ colorful alleyway. Linen sheets hung low throughout the alley as I limboed under\
  \ the miles of clothes with each step. \nSuddenly, one of the children pulled my\
  \ hand. He looked up at me, smiling. We had reached his home and he wanted to invite\
  \ me inside. I had to crouch to get inside the doorway, bending as I entered an\
  \ instantly dark, cold room. The barren walls were made of a clay-like substance\
  \ which cooled the room so quickly that I forgot how hot it was outside. The boy\
  \ tugged at my hand and pulled me into his room where a large sheet covered the\
  \ doorway. His twin bed was inside and in the same room was a fire where a large\
  \ ceramic pot of food was hanging and cooking. The boy lived in this home with his\
  \ grandmother and other family members \u2013 in one space, the size of my living\
  \ room in the States. The boy\u2019s grandmother offered me a hot tea and food --\
  \ a real luxury since many of the children only ate meals while at school. \nAs\
  \ I drank tea with the boy and his grandmother, all I could say was \u2018Asante\u2019\
  \ (\u2018thank you\u2019 in Swahili). I tried to scan my brain for other words I\
  \ knew in Swahili, but I couldn\u2019t. I realized that I didn\u2019t need to say\
  \ more. \u2018Asante\u2019 was enough. Thank you for the walk, the hospitality and\
  \ for a moment that would change my perspective on life. While I was this boy\u2019\
  s teacher, he taught me, in this moment, that life is about always smiling, being\
  \ generous and appreciating your blessings. I walked home with a deeper understanding\
  \ of this community, gained through a local connection."
