Text: "Fifteen trails and over 100 miles, 2016 was an epic year for hiking. The beauty\
  \ of the Pacific Northwest never ceases to amaze me. \n\nI often hike alone and\
  \ there\u2019s nothing more frightening yet peaceful in spending time outdoors with\
  \ myself and my psyche. Mount Storm King on the Olympic Peninsula proved to be the\
  \ most challenging hike. A mile and a half climb to the summit with a 2,000ft. elevation\
  \ gain. This vertigo-inducing trail was pure hell. With my heart pumping, legs burning,\
  \ and knees aching I was battling the inner voices. \n\n\u201CYou\u2019re never\
  \ going to make it to the top, Carla.\u201D\n\nThe good and bad angels rearing their\
  \ ugly heads and twisting my thoughts. My personal failures embodied in physical\
  \ pain. That\u2019s the game they play. My latest setback, a DUI. \n\nGetting a\
  \ DUI was the last thing I\u2019d ever thought would happen to me. Dinner and drinks\
  \ with a friend turned into a nightmare. I was sitting in handcuffs at the police\
  \ station after hitting an empty parked car just a block away from my house.\n\n\
  A short meeting with a couple of lawyers and I was informed that the worst was yet\
  \ to come. Jail. \n\nMonths of court dates followed. Three different prosecutors,\
  \ three different punishments. The inconsistency was maddening. I was sentenced\
  \ two days in jail with community service.\n\nIt was a rainy fall morning when I\
  \ went to the county jail to turn myself in. The clock started as soon as I was\
  \ frisked by the guard. I was led to a room where I was stripped searched and given\
  \ separate clothing. After fingerprinting, I was asked to sign a document warning\
  \ me about potential rape in the cells.\n \n\u201CIf you get raped, it\u2019s your\
  \ fault Carla.\u201D\n\nThe good and bad angels appeared once again.\n\nI was assigned\
  \ an eight by ten foot room with a metal bed, sink, toilet, and a tiny window. There\
  \ were women of all ages in for a variety of crimes and misdemeanors. The water\
  \ tasted like ammonia and the food was horrific. Everyone had a chore and carefully\
  \ monitored by guards. My senses were heightened and working overtime, my face was\
  \ emotionless.\n\nMy release day was long and difficult. The fresh air and vibrant\
  \ colors of the beautiful Pacific Northwest was a shock to my system. I felt an\
  \ indescribable loneliness and finally broke down and cried until my face was numb.\
  \ \n\nI\u2019ll carry that experience for the rest of my life. Each day is a lesson\
  \ on self-love and what it means to be fully human. There will be plenty more of\
  \ life\u2019s ass-kicks to come. Here\u2019s to hiking another 100 miles."
