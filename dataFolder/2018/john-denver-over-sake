Text: "I was so focused on stumbling my way through asking for takeout\u2014and panicking,\
  \ did the Japanese do takeout\u2014that an English word made me jump.  \n\n\u201C\
  Where are you from?\u201D A grey-haired man in wire-frame glasses called. \u201C\
  Are you alone?\u201D\n\nTemporarily. My friend, Izzy, had been dead asleep in the\
  \ ryokan for the last six hours. After a half-day exploring Yudanaka Onsen, she\
  \ collapsed to sleep off nine days of sunrise-to-sunset backpacking through Tokyo,\
  \ Osaka, and Kyoto. \n\nI was less tired, more restless. When I couldn\u2019t wait\
  \ longer, I woke her: \u201CI want to go do something.\u201D \n\nShe groaned and\
  \ growled into the futon, \u201CSo go.\u201D\n\n\u201CI\u2019ll leave you.\u201D\
  \n\n\u201CBye.\u201D She pulled the blanket over her head. \n\nThere weren\u2019\
  t many places to go in Yudanaka in late summer. I strolled across town looking for\
  \ anything still open and ended up at a brightly-lit izakaya. \nI meant to take\
  \ food back to the inn; instead, I knelt on a tatami mat to drink with two gentlemen\
  \ who introduced themselves as Tatebayashi-san and Muranishi-san. A half-empty sake\
  \ bottle and plates of karaage and gyoza on their table proved they were already\
  \ well into their evening. \nThey were former coworkers of a Swedish restaurant\
  \ retail company, for which they learned English. \n\n\u201CWe are both retired\
  \ now,\u201D Tatebayashi explained. \u201CBut I live in Kamakura and Mura-san lives\
  \ in Osaka, so each year we meet here to honor our friendship.\u201D\n\n\u201CWhere\
  \ is your friend?\u201D Muranishi asked. \n\nI confessed to leaving her at the hotel.\
  \ When the two men exchanged a look, I felt the need to add, \u201CI came here to\
  \ get her food.\u201D\n\n\u201CShe has to join us!\u201D Tatebayashi laughed, \u201C\
  Friends should be together.\u201D\n\nWith help their help, I navigated an awkward\
  \ Japanese conversation with the inn keeper and phoned Izzy.  \n\n\u201CI woke up\
  \ and you weren\u2019t here,\u201D she complained. \n\n\u201CI told you I was leaving.\u201D\
  \n\n\u201CI was asleep! I barely heard you.\u201D \n\nTen minutes later, she was\
  \ sipping sake at our table. \n\n\u201CI wish I brought my guitar,\u201D Muranishi\
  \ lamented. \u201CI love American folk music. Do you know John Denver?\u201D \n\n\
  \u201CDo we know John Denver?\u201D Izzy scoffed. \n\nI didn't expect him to break\
  \ into song and suffered a subtle blow to my patriotism when Muranishi knew the\
  \ words to \u201CTake Me Home, Country Roads,\u201D better than me. Izzy and I grinned\
  \ across the table. \n\nWe were a group of people maybe as different as people could\
  \ be\u2014male and female, Western and Eastern, retired and only beginning\u2014\
  but over sake and John Denver, much like my poor Japanese, none of that translated."
