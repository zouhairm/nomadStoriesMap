Text: "Stepping off the bus in Lijiang, China I felt immediately consumed by the rush\
  \ of commotion around me. \n\nAfter travelling for four months in Asia, China was\
  \ easily the most alien country to me. The foods were fiery, the paths were thronged,\
  \ and I found myself lost in translation more than once. \n\nAs I treaded cautiously\
  \ down the cobbled alleys, I searched for something to bring my tired spirits up.\
  \ Most shopkeepers gazed at me with a delicate suspicion.  Standing at nearly six\
  \ feet tall with long blonde hair, I was not their typical tourist.  \n\nAs I tried\
  \ to make my way across the stones in my flimsy backpacker sandals, I noticed a\
  \ restaurant with an English name \u2013 Old Beijing Hot Pot \n\n\u201CCome in,\
  \ come in.  I am Hui, I get Hot Pot for you,\u201D the owner announced cheerfully,\
  \ gesturing for me to sit. \n\nLooking around at all the expensive ingredients she\
  \ laid out, I became suddenly aware of my lack of money.  Certainly, this meal would\
  \ cost more than the 50 Yuan I had tucked away. \n\nFoolishly I tried to explain\
  \ that I did not have enough money to pay for my meal, but she kept repeating \u201C\
  no problem\u201D.  From time to time I saw her speaking into her phone, but I had\
  \ no clue what she was saying. \n\nBefore I had time to think more about my impending\
  \ bill, Hui brought out a large steaming pot of soup broth.  The smell was all-encompassing\
  \ \u2013 the kind that could fill up your soul and stomach all at once.    \n\n\
  Hui sat beside me and motioned that I could put whatever ingredients I wanted into\
  \ the pot.    She then said something else into her phone and I realized it was\
  \ repeating the same phrase back to her in English.  \n\n\u201CI come from Beijing,\u201D\
  \ she said slowly. \u201CWill you help me practice some English words?\u201D  \n\
  \nI realized then why she so excited to see me.  In a small town like Lijiang, it\
  \ would be difficult to find a partner to practice English with.  Feeling my tenseness\
  \ melt away, I managed to answer, \u201CYes, I would be happy to practice with you.\u201D\
  \ \n\nBack and forth we explored all the words I normally take for granted.  This\
  \ didn\u2019t seem like a business exchange anymore. It felt like two friends making\
  \ a connection.  In her world of Lijiang, I felt like the lost one, always struggling\
  \ to get my points across.  But for Hui, I held the greatest currency she could\
  \ desire \u2013 knowledge of English, the universal language.   \n\nAlthough I only\
  \ had 50 yuan to offer for the meal, we both walked away from the exchange just\
  \ a little bit richer than before."
