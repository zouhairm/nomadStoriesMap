Text: "It was a rather sunny August afternoon that I finally set foot on The Pier.\
  \  I could clearly see lines of jetties, placed next to each other waiting to take\
  \ off. The horizon in front of my window stretched out to me, encouraging me to\
  \ embark on my own sea voyage. I still remember how I rushed out of my room, the\
  \ next morning carrying nothing but my towel and wallet with me. Thankfully, I had\
  \ purchased the excursion ticket well in advance, so there were no last-minute hiccups.\n\
  I had never been on a jetty before and all I had seen of the water in the world\
  \ was Goa. This was was humongous. Till that moment I had not realised what I had\
  \ signed up for. I had the ticket for a dive in the seven wonders of the world,\
  \ which amassed endlessly for 2300 km. But my exhilaration knew no boundaries. I\
  \ was to set swim amidst 400 types of corals and sail with 10 per cent of total\
  \ aquatic wildlife. \nAfter an hour of drive, we claimed a calmer portion of the\
  \ ocean to ourselves and anchored. The swimsuits were worn and the oxygen cylinders\
  \ were in place. Imagine, for a person who had not gone below 4 feet of water so\
  \ far, this was a plunge of 115 feet. The last thing, I expected was a nervous breakdown\
  \ in the middle of the water. But the adrenaline rush when I took the plunge, corroded\
  \ away everything else. I felt light, like my body was drifting away with the gigantic\
  \ yet still waves of the ocean. I felt an oneness with the water, that I never even\
  \ knew existed. It was like attaining Moksha. Walking on the sand of the ocean,\
  \ looking up, I could see sunrays flickering down creating Kaleidoscopic images.\
  \ The ocean bed was like a treasure box, waiting to be opened and explored. My fingers\
  \ moved on the different shapes and colours of the corals, soaking as much as my\
  \ senses allowed my brain to comprehend. Lost in my thoughts, I was gently caressed\
  \ by the touch of a sea turtle swimming by. The last thing I expected was my mind\
  \ to lose control with a refusal to leave this watery world. And as if, the dive\
  \ was not enough, I even walked on the still water to be lucky enough to find a\
  \ pair of \u201CNemo\u201D gently swimming by. The beauty was breath taking. I was\
  \ relieved that my heart had not pumping.\nParched and famished yet hungry for more,\
  \ I returned to the jetty, waiting to take me back to my room. I still remember\
  \ that night I fell into a deep slumber, a manifestation of the water kingdom, where\
  \ I was a mermaid and swimming with the dolphins, waiting to take me on my next\
  \ adventure."
