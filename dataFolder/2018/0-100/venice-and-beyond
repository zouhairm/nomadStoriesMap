Text: After my boyfriend and me experienced and me experienced an amazing long week
  end in Venice where we met a mask maker who helped us dive into the Venetian culture,
  we witnessed a local festival while making friends, we got stuck. No money, no transport.
  Just a long way to the mainland where our plane would not be waiting for us. A race
  against time alongside the motorway that leads to some pretty personal conclusions
  about travelling.
