Text: 'I grew up in the desert in my youth

  It was a small village near the city of Marrakech

  I learned to read and was four years old

  I was living in vague dreams

  So came the day I and my father went to the market in town

  I saw several strange things

  The strange thing was that these things were in my dreams

  I began to try to discover the world'
