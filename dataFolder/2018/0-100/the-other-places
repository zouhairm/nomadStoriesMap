Text: Outrageously out of his mind, a young ethnographer feels the need to grow away
  from his birth country, France. Following the path of authors and novelists he worked
  on, and drawn to it by his passion for magical realism novels, he decides to explore
  Argentina. But the more he explores this other place, the more it puts him in an
  ambiguous position.
