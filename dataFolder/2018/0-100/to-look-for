Text: I travel to know the culture ,the traditionals and most importantly to understand
  the way how people in different parts of the world/country live, think , grow ,
  collaborate with others... The most exciting part to come across is to change ones
  perception towards life bcoz we meet with different people's with their own ideas
  n opinion that gives u confidence and more options to explore on..
