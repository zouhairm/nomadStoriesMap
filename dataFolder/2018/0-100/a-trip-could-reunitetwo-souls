Text: i am travelling to join my girlfriend in Argentina, we visited a lot of cities
  and small villiges. We had a lot of adventure and made a lot of friends. We alreafy
  wrote notes aboit our days in Patagonia even about our fights. The feelings we had
  to each other made the trip unforgetable and we made a lot of friends. We visited
  Elcalafate, Elchalten, Los antigos, Gregos Gregos, Bariloche. we didnt use buses
  all the time to travel. This was the most amazing experiemce i have ever had in
  my life.
