Text: I have traveled to thailand and cambodia to teach English and was able to bring
  so much back and be inspired by the trip more than i ever imagined. Would love an
  opportunity where i can travel again and bring back my story and insights of other
  countries what is considered normal here and whats considered normal there. Is normal
  reay normal?
