Text: I'm a young guy from Las Vegas, Nevada that loves traveling and meeting new
  people, I always think that is something new that we can learn from other cultures.
  At the same time that we can teach to others too, it's one of the greatest experiences
  that we can have, it's a good way to see in others ways of living and learn from
  it, that's a thing that I really enjoy doing.
