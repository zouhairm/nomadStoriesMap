Text: I would like to show people the imensity and the greatness of what being human
  means. I'm thinking of a whole story based on real accurate discaised information
  and in the last chapter I would reveal the content. I can do this. This is a inner
  journey. If you would like to put it at some extant in a cathegory it would be spiritual.
  Spiritual in a way wich is all about shifting your priorities and aligning everything
  about you in such a way that it all works well.
