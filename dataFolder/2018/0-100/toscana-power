Text: 'It was first time that i was travelling alone, but its feels so free...when
  you hide a car and can see views of Tuscany you can''t forget that in your Life!

  Maybe drink a wine chianti also a great cheese or "italian pasta" and can discover
  how you feel inside you a wonderful sensation of peace.

  Italian streets singers make that you smile and dont look for anything more...

  Every person give you information about what you can do, eat or drink with a Big
  smile.'
