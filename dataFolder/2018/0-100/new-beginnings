Text: So I packed up my children and moved to Hawaii. Having never stepped foot on
  the island and only knew one friend, it was a desperate situation. And I was not
  only desperate but I was determined, to get as far as possible from everyone and
  everything that had hurt us; and make a new  happy life for my two young boys and
  me.
