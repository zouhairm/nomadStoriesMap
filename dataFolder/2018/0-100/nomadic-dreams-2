Text: 'Travel is an expression, it''s an art form, it''s a soul transforming experience.
  It cannot be expressed, it can be felt like a breeze that touches your skin, you
  can feel it, observe it but expressing the exact feeling is a hard task.

  As an avid traveller i feel that a traveler doen''t has any agenda and talking about
  myself i like to go with no purpose in mind just a sense of heart beating inside
  me and excitement to feel all the unprecedented experiences and loosing myself with
  the thought of being  nomad.'
