Text: 'A trip to one of the wildest places in the world: Las Islas de San Blas. A
  great friend of my little Trentino town (Levico Terme) as well as a real man and
  captain of a catamaran and a friend who always reminds me of my Venetian origins
  (Bassano del Grappa). And then small pristine atolls with palm and coconut , turtles
  , stingrays, parrots, toucans, lobsters, crabs, pelicans, dolphins, starfish ...
  No distraction: only oneself immersed in breathtaking nature. A journey of self
  discovery immersed in a world that never ceases to amaze.'
