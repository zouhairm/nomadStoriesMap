Text: The summer coming... After long months living the white and ice surface of the
  authentic European winter cames time to go! To go the passion to discover, and experience
  the incredible beauties that only nature can provide. In the country of love the
  lights also shine in the light of day. Walking, seeing, living or simply falling
  asleep on the beaches of the most beautiful European coast is more than a dream,
  it is an indescribable pleasure. French Riviera is an invitation to the most passionate
  who wishes not only to see it but mostly to feel it!
