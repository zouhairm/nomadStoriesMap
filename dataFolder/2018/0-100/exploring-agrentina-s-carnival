Text: I want to explore Argentina during their annual Carnival Celebration. I want
  to write about the culture, the history, the food, and the best places a tourist
  would like to visit. I want to explore Argentina because I want to explore a new
  culture and be able to cross it off my bucket list. I want to be able to take pictures
  and video to document my visit.
