Text: 'I would like to discover the small art communities and to meet people and movements
  around art, traditions and people.

  Other interests are folkloric dresses and traditions to go deeper into the different
  regions and places around the area.

  The last thing is to know as much as possible of the difference between some areas
  and others in Argentina.'
