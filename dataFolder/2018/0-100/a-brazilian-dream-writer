Text: Making a local connection with another country at that time would be perfect
  for me. I really like to connect with a new cultures, new people, new language,
  have more luggage to carry, I really like sharing everything I live with photos,
  texts, videos, always connecting with the world, it would be an incredible opportunity!
  To travel is to connect with a new freedom, is to want to fly, to learn.
