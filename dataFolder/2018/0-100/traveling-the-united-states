Text: "Growing up in the United States, there is plenty of opportunity of breathtaking\
  \ travel destinations. \n   I have traveled almost every state here, and lived all\
  \ over the West Coast. A dream of mine is to travel across the seas. To create connections\
  \ with the people and experience a new culture. Help me make my dreams, my reality.\
  \ Thank you, Auria Saxton."
