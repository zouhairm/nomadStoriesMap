  \ the political past.  Argentina can be quite the place to be from the food, nightclub\
  \ s and  cafe's in cities to the the ranchs wherw rhe guacho's roam and the rustic\
  \ mountains stand tall, it offers an amazing travel experience.  \n\n#futbol being\
  \ a big part of Argentina, the incredible history behind Maradona is a vital to\
  \ Argentina. \n\nI would love to be your travel guide around Argentina!"
