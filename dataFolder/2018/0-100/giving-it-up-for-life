Text: 'A story about making the decision between a love of the outdoors and mountaineering
  and stopping smoking.

  Whilst it seems like a easy decision to make and mentaly it is, at first at least.
  The journey was a long one and extremely hard to say the least.

  Starting from the very beginning, from when I was starting to take an interest in
  the outdoors and climbing all whilst coming to terms with the need to stop smoking
  to continue my passion.'
