Text: I grew up in a village. It was/is a bubble. I ran away at the first chance I
  got. Since then, life has been an adventure. The travel bug has bitten and I am
  so excited to see what's out there to see and experience.  I'm older (32) but more
  excited than ever to experience and write about my adventures
