Text: 'I have not been to many places but then I have had trips to places where you
  need a lot of energy and adventure.. This feeling of not been able to go out to
  much places makes me feel I want to go to tons of places and share the experience
  with everyone and as to how one can enjoy their own company.


  Feel free and start your journey whenever you feel like because time and tide waits
  for none!'
