Text: "Spend around 2 motnhs in Thailand makes me open my heart to real people. I\
  \ started to see what is inside being one of them and leaving behind the overestimated\
  \ ideas we have as a simple tourist.\nWell there is a lot of things you can say\
  \ about this country and people but certainly I struggle finding the correct  words.\
  \ And also a lot and lots of photos. \nI would like to improve my writings. To put\
  \ my ideas in words.\n\nSara\nXx"
