Text: 'Being deeply connected to the essence of life was the last thing i expected.
  Life is short. We have one. If we hear the little music we have inside, we are guided.
  There are signs everywhere you can see if you open wide your eyes, your spirit and
  you let go. Travelling, going out its comfort zone, behind lost outside the highway
  allow to find its own path.

  This is my travel story.

  Come with me and discover your own path.'
