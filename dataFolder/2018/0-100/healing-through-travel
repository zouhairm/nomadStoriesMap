Text: "Using travel as a healthy venue for healing. Not all who are lost need to be\
  \ found. Travel is the best way to feel lost and found at the same time.\nNomadic\
  \ culture and experiences push us out of our comfort zone.\nI\u2019m leaving the\
  \ family and familiar, we can reinvent the collective perception of who we are.\n\
  Indonesia is an amalgam of religions, history, food and stories.\nWith this I invite\
  \ you to lose yourself with me."
