Text: I travel not just to escape from reality of life but also to get the essence
  of the city I'm travelling too. I still remembered the time me and my amigos took
  a road trip to Goa from Delhi. It was the best there ever could be , best part of
  the trip was long drives and road side view that we were capturing not just in cameras
  but also in our hearts. I wish my eyes could speak that would justify the trip experience.
