Text: The story is about my one month study aboard trip to Kilifi, Kenya. An academic
  venture became a forbidden love affair with nature, community and a beau; being
  described in a non-fictional tale. The purpose of the story is to introduce a new
  perspective of Africa. A land not defined as the ravaged jungles wroth with poverty,
  violence, and disease. But a community filled with love, hope, and untapped natural
  beauty.
