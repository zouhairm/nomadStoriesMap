Text: In this moment I think that life is everithing that happens alond the road that
  supose to bring  us to the goal, even if the goal is changing all the time. My story
  would be how my snowboarding, missed flights and interest in so many different things,
  with very good socioal skils(making new frindships), from Greece, USA, Spain and
  Italy, brought me to live in a beutiful bearfoot world in island Zanzibar in Tanzania.
