Text: 'Hi myself Ankita Vyas from India.

  My travel story is about Himachal Pradesh,India. I had visited Himachal with family.
  It was wonderful experience. Himachal is very beautiful place to visit and spend
  some quality time. Himachal is perfect combination of beautiful nature, awesome
  weather and wonderful culture.. It''s home to scenic mountain towns and resorts
  such as Dalhousie. Host to the Dalai Lama, Himachal Pradesh has a strong Tibetan
  presence. This is reflected in its Buddhist temples and monasteries, as well as
  its vibrant Tibetan New Year celebrations. The region is also well known for its
  trekking, climbing and skiing areas.'
