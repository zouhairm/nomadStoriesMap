Text: Im writing a story about my life as a travelling guide. Im telling people how
  does the life work and what can I and what can i not do. Lot of people wants to
  be guides because they want to travel but I want to tell them what is the better
  way to wanderlust. Im also a vegan so my story is also lot about how does it work
  in the countries where they think chicken is vegetable.
