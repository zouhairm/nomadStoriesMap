Text: "Soul of shadow\" And  their 'emotions'\n rolling over the mind \nTo the sun.....\n\
  \"Soul of Shadow\" and their 'colors'\nSpreading through the wind \nTo the sun......\n\
  \nTravel till the last breath because your soul is not only traveling within your\
  \ mind and body but in the other space too"
