Text: 'Valley of Flowers..

  The place where you can connect your soul with the smile of God..

  Beautiful flowers, cold drizzle, rocky slippery way and random streams, surrounded
  by forest trees...

  The track is full of adventure and should filling experiences...


  The trake starts at early morning 6am from Gangharia hotel stay, following by morning
  snacks and Hot cup of tea..

  With the first check in from entrance, one has to start journey climbing the hill
  with hair pin bands stair ways... The way is too narrow to walk together..'
