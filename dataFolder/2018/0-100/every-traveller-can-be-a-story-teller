Text: Very travelled just before to Papikondalu, from then m more excited to visit
  entire world and make sure I capture the beautiful earth.. IL make sure my trip
  will be the best out of the best. Probably everyone likes travelling but there is
  a difference between traveling and a traveller. If I'd get a opportunity then I'd
  love to show the difference..
