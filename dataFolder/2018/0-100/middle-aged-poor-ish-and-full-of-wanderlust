Text: I'm 39 and I haven't travelled enough, I had a health scare last year and suddenly
  my underlying need to travel kicked into overdrive. I've never really felt settled
  for some reason and so finally at the start of 2017 I started my trips to Italy.
  4 clocked up now and truly loving it. I have made up a list of places I need to
  go from here too. So there's Tokyo, Istanbul, Goa, Vietnam, Canada, USA, Mexico,
  Morocco...to name a few. And my story as I near 40 is only just beginning.
