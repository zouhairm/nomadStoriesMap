Text: The last thing I expected was to fall in love. Rush now dear its 8.55 you have
  to submit your story. While you run wild with butterflies life swings you by the
  hips and whispers to you "you deserve this". You are capable of captivating me.
  That's when I fell in love with you my dear. That's when all lights shined lightly
  and agonizingly addictive. The day I fell in love with you, I fell in love with
  me too.
