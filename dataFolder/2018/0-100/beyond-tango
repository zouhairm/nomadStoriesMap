Text: 'I would like to travel to Argentina meet their culture and writing story "beyond
  Tango". Everyone knows that Tango is from Argetina but there is

  more than Tango. I pretend to explore food, Arquitectura, lifestyle, culture, footboll
  and muchmore.


  And I prentend to bring new perceptive of their culture.'
