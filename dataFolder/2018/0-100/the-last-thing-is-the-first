Text: 'The first times, we never forget, the first feeling through a new experience.
  Something everybody should had is a oportunitie to travel and know how is travel
  and be in different place, know another people and culture, this is how someone
  grow to live.

  The best experience is when we never expected and suddely we are suprised to visit
  another country, city or state. The travel  knowledge is a treasure we found it
  ever time in a new trip.'
