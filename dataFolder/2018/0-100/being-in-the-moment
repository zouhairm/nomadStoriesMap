Text: Years ago my husband and myself traveled to the Baja Peninsula in Mexico. We
  stayed in a trailer all to ourselves. Spent time on the beach all to ourselves.
  It was like heaven. I rode a white horse bare back on the beach, each rode with
  a man from London on his ultra light over the Sea of Cortez. We had wonderful food,
  danced, visited sights in the town of San Felipe and my husband went on the gulf
  fishing. I also did water aerobics by a nearby pool. It was the most memorable trip
  we have ever experienced.
