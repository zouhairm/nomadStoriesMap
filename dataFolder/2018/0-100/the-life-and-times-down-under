Text: It's a celebration of the past three years of my life, from those majestic ocean
  drives to hunger stricken hikes in the outback, from party filled nights on the
  goldcoast to lonely camps in Tasmania, this magnificent country has got it all,
  mountains, oceans, skyscrapers and last but not least it's people, the people of
  Australia are so beautiful that, its simply tough to explain in mere characters,
  they are and always will be the country that stole my breath away
