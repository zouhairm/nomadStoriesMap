Text: I was beside myself at the beauty and serenity of the country side. It took
  my breath away! The people were extremely friendly and so very helpful. One of the
  thing that I like to experience when I travel to a new place is to try the food.
  I was not disappointed as the food was an experience that I will savour  for a very
  long time. Even the weather was something that the average traveler dreams about.
