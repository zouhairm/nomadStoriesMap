Text: As they say travelling changes you as a person..  Indeed it does!  It made me
  kinda broke.  Jokes apart it made me richer experience wise.  I travelled to tiajin
  China. It was one of the best experience I have ever had.  People are very warm
  and kind Don't interact a lot but very helpful. The history and architecture had
  me awe struck!!.
