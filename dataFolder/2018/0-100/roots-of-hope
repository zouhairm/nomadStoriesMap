Text: 'Everything is courage!

  Challenges are like fireworks, exploding and enchanting  people with bright in the
  sky.

  The man goes to the moon, it seems impossible until then, nothing is impossible
  when you can dream!

  I look for ourselves in the eyes, in the rights, in the courage to live the diversity!

  The connection between people and cultural differences make me vibrate love and
  brings meaning to a more colorful life!'
