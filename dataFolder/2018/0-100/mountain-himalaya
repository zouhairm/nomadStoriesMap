Text: Travelling in mountain is addictive. Once trekking for 5 days in kashmir in
  mountain made addiction of mountain and made me do trekking for 1 month in sikkim.
  The culture difference is totally different from my home town. I made new friends
  of different regions of india all with different language and different background.
  While my trekking of 1 month , there was no mobile network for 15 days. That made
  us connect more deeply with people. All have different stories to share. Now i am
  planning to go again in himalaya for a month in near future.
