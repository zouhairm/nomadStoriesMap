Text: 'I m a traveler from time to time.and with such a short time I have travelled
  all India except south region as God still has not blessed me to come.

  Well the most peacefully travelling for me was Golden temple, Amritsar Punjab India
  with family.

  As my name indicate, Shravan do definitely it will b always to make my parents travel
  every place.

  The most important thing at golden temple is that the peace I found there,I have
  not found that one even in lotus temple Delhi India.

  There no rich poor different,no caste bar no religion matter.The thing that matters
  most is feeling.'
