Text: "I was on a road trip around europe and ended up in prague. While there i met\
  \ a young man. We spent time together exploring prague. He'd been there awhile and\
  \ new quite a few nice places so we would spend any free time he had wondering around.\
  \ We explored the under ground areas which were used by the locals during the world\
  \ war. \nIt was a wonderful trip and has stayed with me. I will always have wonderful\
  \ memories of him and the city itself. We keep in touch. We always have fun when\
  \ together."
