Text: 'A trip into the tribal villages of Semiliguda Forest Range in the state of
  Odisha is a revelation in itself.


  Cut off from the rest of the world, these villages and its inhabitants are echoes
  away from the modern world and continue to exist, just as we do, unaware of each
  other.


  While some tribal communities still dwell deep into the forests, over the decades
  many have left behind the wilderness that was once the abode of their ancestors
  and formed tiny hamlets, taking up farming to fend for themselves.'
