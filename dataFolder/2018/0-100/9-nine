Text: "This is a poetry book in style of story about embracing sadness within ourselves,\
  \ becoming one with our own thoughts, even though sometimes they seem to come from\
  \ other minds. It's mostly about loneliness and a loud mind who won't shut up no\
  \ matter how much easier life would be if it did. \n9 is the master piece of my\
  \ life."
