Text: 'I am interested how is the impact of Ernesto "Che" Guevara de la Serna today,
  how people in Argentina see him: a hero, an assasine, a devil?

  I would like to make interviews with locals, what they know about him, what they
  think about the revolution, what they think about their history.'
