Text: 'Travel while Black is a snap shot of the travel of a single black woman.

  She is a 40 something professional. You''ll experience various cultures through
  her perspective. She''ll get down and dirty in local culture by experiencing meals
  in local people''s homes and bridge the discussion of race in their country. She''ll
  experience cultural norms while dating in another culture. Finally, while discovering
  universal language of love and food she''ll discover local fashion that transcends
  traditional to contemporary.'
