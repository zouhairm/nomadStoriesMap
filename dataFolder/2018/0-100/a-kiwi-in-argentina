Text: The last thing I expected was to be stuck in Argentina not being able to speak
  the Language,wandering around in a daze trying to find the woman who stole my heart.Wondering
  if I will ever find her and if she is still mine,noone to ask for help just a kiwi
  far from home looking for my love.
