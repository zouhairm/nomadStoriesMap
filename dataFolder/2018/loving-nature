  new things ,to see so many new things from different state ,recently i travelled
  to jammu kashmir a very known place of India ,kashmir which is called heaven is
  really feel like heaven when you been there ,i love the place the fresh air ,the
  high mountains ,pine trees and the best view from everywhere we see,anyone would
  love that experience,if you love nature,peace and mountains you will definately
  gonna love that place just like i do.i love travelling kashmir have their own beautiful
  culture i love the experience travelling in that city .so many beautiful places
  the famous one is Gulmarg you will definately say heaven on Earth is in kashmir,beautiful
  weather,view and the fresh air is just amazing,in winters is too cold there so will
  freeze sometime ,best option to warm your body temprature having a cup of tea is
  best thing there,well i am a tea lover but you can try soo many hot things like
