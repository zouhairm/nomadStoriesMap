Text: "Tepoztl\xE1n was our first encounter with a \u2018Pueblo Magico\u2019. The\
  \ arrival wasn\u2019t as whimsical as we might have imagined; we were dumped from\
  \ the bus on the hard shoulder of the motorway and left gobsmacked by a grass verge.\n\
  Trying to do things like a local, avoiding tourist buses, can get you in a pickle\
  \ sometimes. We looked for signs, nada. It made sense not to attempt running across\
  \ the motorway; so, that only left behind us. We scrambled up and dipped down into\
  \ a smaller cobbled road; determined to ask someone the way. It\u2019s easy to be\
  \ confident when the sun is out and there\u2019s two of you.\nWhether in a quaint\
  \ province or throng of Mexico City, people using sweeping brushes made entirely\
  \ of sticks is customary (picture a witch\u2019s broom in the shape of a rake).\
  \ The Se\xF1ora venomously swatting her step, who I tried my Spanglish out on, gestured\
  \ emphatically to a taxi and insisted, \u201Cdown, down, down!\u201D to get to the\
  \ center (these may not have been her words, I\u2019m saying this based on her charades\
  \ ability, not linguistic comprehension). Relieved to have deciphered it was a single\
  \ mountain road we needed to follow, we strode on. Who pays for a taxi when it\u2019\
  s one road?\nIf streets can reflect their residents, like dogs their owners, then\
  \ Tepoztl\xE1n\u2019s image is a consistent one, it\u2019s affable. All of it. \
  \ A squat man, lined like a treasured love letter, was roasting chickens on a spit\
  \ at the entrance to a courtyard. Emboldened by our success with the bus debacle\
  \ and avoiding paying for a taxi, we took another gamble and accepted his offer\
  \ of food. \nWe were shooed onwards, towards plastic chairs and sat in the communal\
  \ garden of a few homes. A stray dog seeking shade; two children chasing each other,\
  \ and a rusting swing-set perched on a flat roof without a ladder to be seen, our\
  \ companions.\nA startled looking matriarch offered us water and we realised immediately\
  \ they did not normally host. We were not in a restaurant or casual alfresco pop-up,\
  \ there were no menus. We were just benefitting from serendipity (and poor, but\
  \ well-meaning, Spanish skills which open many doors for you in Mexico).\nThe chicken\
  \ had been seasoned with some sort of chili, naturally, and the rice was served\
  \ with lime. Sublime. The stray appreciated his scraps. The whole thing would have\
  \ come to two dollars, we left double in gratitude for such rare hospitality. We\
  \ left without fanfare. The real magic of this Pueblo lies in the unexpected embrace\
  \ of the natives, not the landmarks."
