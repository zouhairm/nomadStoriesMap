Text: "The island of La Reunion - in it's entirety - was not what I expected when\
  \ I clambered out from a twelve hour flight from Paris- the only place you can fly\
  \ from to get to this remote island that's situated off the South East coast of\
  \ Africa in the Indian Ocean.\nMade up from two volcanoes - one of which is still\
  \ very much active; the other having blown itself up 200 000 years ago - Reunion\
  \ has shark infested waters and vegetation that simultaneously reflects both African\
  \ jungles and Asian forests. Situated next to Mauritius and Madagascar, La Reunion\
  \ is nothing like it's cousins. Instead of Reunion's English colonised neighbour,\
  \ Mauritius, Reunion is part of the French colony, which has allowed the island\
  \ to remain relatively unchanged, ensuring a far more authentic experience than\
  \ Mauritius. \n\nReunion is where you can find an eclectic and impressive combination\
  \ of Martian lands, that have been permeated by luscious forestation; it's where\
  \ there are, literally, fields of lava and molten rock; where you can trek for hours\
  \ through forests to find giant, cascading waterfalls, or cafes that have been sewn\
  \ in to the volcanoes by the roots of the trees.\n\nNow, as exquisite as all of\
  \ this is, I have to pay tribute to the locals who inhabit the island, with a special\
  \ tribute to their unprecedented love of running. I mean, whilst I paced myself\
  \ along these steep and turbulent paths, the Reunionese would be bolting it to the\
  \ top. In fact, they would pass you at the bottom and you'd be about half way up\
  \ before they would pass you again- but the other way. Frankly, their abilities\
  \ and grace in doing so blew my mind because I struggle to run 5 meters without\
  \ looking like an emu who's been frightened. \n\nThe Reunionese's ability to run\
  \ wasn't the only thing I didn't expect. Perhaps more importantly than the running\
  \ (perhaps) was how the local Creoles were so friendly and welcoming: totally in\
  \ love with the land they call home, and proudly showing off past disasters (like\
  \ a beautiful church that had been sealed in to the ground by molten rock) as a\
  \ marvel to be seen- which, indeed, it was. On one of my days at the beach, I stood\
  \ on a piece of coral, and about fifteen people came running to my rescue, with\
  \ one man insisting on carrying me ten minutes to first aid (and then carrying me\
  \ the ten minutes back). \n\nBoth the island itself and that of it's inhabitants,\
  \ ensures that La Reunion remains an exotic paradise that is unforgettable for its\
  \ undeniable uniqueness."
