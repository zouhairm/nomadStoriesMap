Text: "The flight to Calgary and then Montreal was quick. I am now sitting in a cafe.\
  \ It is raining but I don\u2019t mind that. I should start doing something beautiful\
  \ with my time.\n\nI have been sitting at this cafe, listening to the classical\
  \ music and slow jazz that is playing in the background.Something about Montreal\
  \ illustrates life well. People all going different directions, not meaning to be\
  \ rude but coming across that way, anyways.\n\nThere is something new on each street,\
  \ something undiscovered. I am reading \"A Grief Observed\" and thinking about the\
  \ toughest parts of life. As I look around I discover things about myself.\n\nIt\
  \ is the isolation that I crave, with so many people you can hide away and become\
  \ invisible because you are just another face that is gone the next second after\
  \ noticing it. Maybe that is why people come to big cities.\n\nI am working on some\
  \ writing, pondering Lewis\u2019 depression. Soothing. The sound of plates clashing\
  \ in the background as they are being collected laughs even further out behind the\
  \ counter.\n\nWhat is it about language that is so essential? Why should we write?\
  \ I wonder. Maybe it is because of this, this unseen beauty that is unknown but\
  \ can be known.\n\nThe thoughts of another person on paper, thoughts you can read\
  \ and hope to understand. We chase wisdom for the sake of happiness. It is, arguably,\
  \ the only happiness that is attainable. And it is understandable that we pursue\
  \ it through words.\n\nWords are to be used in a form of therapy, as we see with\
  \ Lewis' book. Lewis needed some sort of therapeutic pondering and so he took to\
  \ the pen and paper.\n\nIt is good to sit and think and process these thoughts on\
  \ paper. You say things that you did not know you think. It is a form of meditation,\
  \ even if no one reads it, which in this case should be true, that is where you\
  \ find yourself most happy.\n\nIt started pouring just now, pouring rain. And it\
  \ has stopped after a while.\n\nMy bed is comfortable but laying in it for too long\
  \ is painful. There is too much to see and to know in this city to do that without\
  \ a sense of guilt. I wonder, is this how Camus felt, or Hemingway, or Fitzgerald\
  \ as they were walking through the streets of Paris.\n\nMontreal is best understood\
  \ when it is raining. It cleanses the city, makes it easier to associate emotions\
  \ with it.\n\nMontreal has been good to my soul. Now I come back to that place where\
  \ I came from and I attempt to transcribe what I have witnessed place to place.\n\
  \nPlane to plane. House to house. Bed to bed."
