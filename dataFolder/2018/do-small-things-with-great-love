Text: "January 2016 - tired, lying still in bed after sleepless weeks thrust into\
  \ organising India's Largest Youth Festival in Bangalore. Withdrawal symptoms started\
  \ to kick in when a faint but familiar voice rang my eardrums, \"There's accommodation\
  \ for one more person, you in?\" My sister gave her third year medical examinations\
  \ not long before planning a trip to Kashmir, truly 'Paradise on Earth'.\nBeing\
  \ a junior and the only Engineer amongst a group of nine medicos, I was inevitably\
  \ handed over all the errands. But little did they know, the curious kid in me was\
  \ immensely fond of talking to the locals.\nFaizan, who's home is back in Kashmir\
  \ had spoken of the majestic crown of India and his Uncle organised the complete\
  \ itinerary for us.\nUpon introduction to Faizan's indefatigable Uncle, here I met\
  \ Javed - a retired army personnel who resorted to security and simpler pleasures\
  \ of life!\nHe'd been assigned to ensure we don't get cheated by the locals for\
  \ adventure activities and in general safety. At the very first glimpse, I noticed\
  \ his ever beaming smile across the wrinkled face. We shared a common taste for\
  \ old Hindi songs and before anyone even predicted, we burst into a duet trying\
  \ hard to harmonise in the tempo. Not realising, we'd grown fond of the others company\
  \ as we asked him stories of disputed Kashmir who wanted to become an independent\
  \ state. He introduced me to Kahwa, the Yerba of Kashmir! Soon, we were firing snow\
  \ balls at each other, breaking momentum to  already slippery skiing routes, making\
  \ snow angels, sledging and what not. We'd created an intimate bond as we spoke\
  \ about our love for the country over the infamous tea. He told me the harsh truth\
  \ of an army life but his willing to cross his heart for the nation. \nDays passed\
  \ and we were headed to a boat house over the beautiful Dal Lake. Javed was posted\
  \ to another office and the news of a last goodbye daunted me. We had gotten too\
  \ comfortable. We parted our goodbye's with a promise to stay in touch. \nLast day\
  \ at Kashmir, returning from the boat house, I see this figure standing behind our\
  \ tempo. It was Javed. I couldn't contain my excitement and jumped on him. Even\
  \ the birds chirped to the warmth of our hug that lasted minutes! Tears rolling\
  \ down his eyes, a true local connect.\nI spent the entire day with him, we exchanged\
  \ addresses and he uncovered stories about his family and that Javed wasn't his\
  \ real name!"
