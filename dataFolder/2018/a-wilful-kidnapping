Text: "I\u2019m on a bus next to a local man, Ferri, who is telling me about the time\
  \ he kidnapped his wife. Apparently it\u2019s a tradition in Lombok, Indonesia;\
  \ sneaking your girlfriend into a safe house is the most romantic way to \u2018\
  pop the question\u2019. This kidnapping went particularly well and he now lives\
  \ in a beautiful home with his wife and adorable baby. I know this because he invited\
  \ me over for lunch.\n\nCurious, I arrived the next day with two friends and was\
  \ greeted in the street by screams of \u201CHELLO MISTER!\u201D A crowd of children\
  \ came running, directly from the mosque, with the conviction of English kids chasing\
  \ after an ice-cream van. As colourful hijabs and embroidered caps clung on for\
  \ dear life, it was clear they had been dressed with the intent of solemn prayer.\
  \ Oblivious, they guided us to Ferrie\u2019s home, whispering and giggling as we\
  \ weaved between the houses.\n\nFerri welcomed us into a room overlooking a landscape\
  \ of tropical trees. We sat in a small circle on the floor and as the space between\
  \ us filled with dishes of fish, salads and sauces, the nerves were kicking in.\
  \ I took a tiny sample in my hand and paired it with an oversized portion of rice.\
  \ As it touched my lips I felt the tingle of an unfortunate truth. Ferri had warned\
  \ me that the food here was hot, but he was insistent we should try the real deal.\
  \ Determined to show my gratitude, I tried to hide it, but the coconut water and\
  \ rice couldn\u2019t save me. A crying, snivelling mess, I sent a pained smile across\
  \ to our hosts and realised that my struggle was in fact a complement. Spice is\
  \ Lombok\u2019s badge of honour, the name literally means \u2018chilli\u2019.\n\n\
  An hour later, a short walk from the village, I was wading into thigh-deep water.\
  \ The weight of a full river pressed against my legs and suddenly I was on my back,\
  \ rushing toward a deeper part of the channel. The depth dropped and my body was\
  \ forced into a full forward flip. I found myself floating into the main river,\
  \ past happy naked children peeing freely from the bank. In true Indonesian spirit,\
  \ this channel from Dutch colonial times had been repurposed as a water slide.\n\
  \nThe same river became the setting for a barbecue as our lunch visit extended into\
  \ an entire evening. The atmosphere was one of celebration and Ferri expressed a\
  \ pride for his culture that he was honoured to share. That night his family let\
  \ three complete strangers sleep in their home, well fed and full of wonder. \n\n\
  And to think, my mum told me to stop making friends on buses!"
