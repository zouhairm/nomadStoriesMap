Text: "\"Give a man a fish and he eats for a day. Teach a man to fish and he eats\
  \ for life.\" This is how the saying goes and the words recited by Ana in our first\
  \ chance meeting. As a private school English teacher in Thailand, she invited me\
  \ to see her volunary work in Cambodia; I held her to it.\n\nSouth-East Asia's customary\
  \ tuk-tuk is basic in design, yet sturdy and reliable. \"Ana's Tuk-Tuk English School\"\
  \ was no different, apart from the abundance of simple, hand-made material kept\
  \ on the back seat. A quick ride out of Siem Reap changes the landscape vividly\
  \ - from the somewhat westernised city to sweeping landscapes of rice fields. Here\
  \ lay the four schools of the day, two of which I learnt the deepest of lessons.\n\
  \nIt has to be understood that the term 'school' here is used loosely. The first\
  \ of the four has been a work in progress for the past six years, when its owner,\
  \ Veasna, started teaching his one and (at the time) only student in his back yard.\
  \ Since then, the number of students has sprung to nearly 300 everyday. Veasna's\
  \ going rate is $1 per student each month, giving him a stable income, but it's\
  \ Ana's donations that keep the classroom developing.\n\nAmongst a whirlwind of\
  \ stories and characters I encountered, the third school we visited was an especially\
  \ emotional experience. The reality of Ana's third school in her average day was\
  \ at the end of the dirt track, and was no more than a circular ground bordered\
  \ by five straw huts. Where the previous schools could depend on a whiteboard and\
  \ physical walls, here the class involved singing, dancing, and a stack of papers,\
  \ each one with a hand-drawn letter for all, even the babes and adults, to spell\
  \ out words and phrases. Half an hour after, the youngsters took us by the hand\
  \ into the surrounding rice fields, singing along to my own rhymes. This, to me,\
  \ will always be the true Cambodia.\n\nAlthough I'd agreed to be \"teacher\", I\
  \ felt that I was the one who really gained an education. I learnt that Ana\u2019\
  s day is exhausting, dusty and dirty; it\u2019s wearing and hard work. It\u2019\
  s also emotionally stirring and rewarding. It's said that we don\u2019t know how\
  \ lucky we are; it only takes seeing the positivity in the Cambodian people and\
  \ the conditions they live through to realise that we really don\u2019t take time\
  \ to appreciate even the smallest things we have, like the education to gain what\
  \ we know as common sense and skills that are both transferable and for life. As\
  \ the saying goes, now, we need to \"teach how to fish.\""
