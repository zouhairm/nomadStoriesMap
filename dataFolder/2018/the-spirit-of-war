Text: "I stepped off the plane and onto Vietnam soil, the second country I had ever\
  \ travelled to outside of Australia.  Prior to departure, I was excited to learn\
  \ about the rich culture of the Vietnamese people, as well as witness how it differed\
  \ from North to South.  I had seen many photos of the beautiful ancient towns, rivers\
  \ and beaches.  Getting those \u201Cinsta worthy pics\u201D was somewhat important\
  \ to me!  What I could never have anticipated however, was the introduction I was\
  \ given to the effects of war.  You see, during the war, Vietnam was sprayed with\
  \ a chemical named agent orange.  Those who were exposed to it suffered irreversible\
  \ genetic defects.  Over 40 years later and people are still giving birth to children\
  \ with serious, debilitating disabilities.  I saw photo upon photo of children with\
  \ physical deformities and even drove past the odd orphanage.  Up to 3 million people\
  \ have been affected by the chemical, yet I saw not one child first hand who had\
  \ any form of observable disability.  I was disheartened; disappointed that the\
  \ people affected were kept away from the public eye.  Towards the end of my trip\
  \ I arrived at the war museum in Ho Chi Minh (or as the locals call it - Saigon).\
  \  Could I emotionally manage yet another museum with depictions of death, destruction\
  \ and despair?  Much to my joy, I could.  The museum had employed people affected\
  \ by agent orange to entertain us.  A man with no eyes played the piano beautifully,\
  \ whilst others with deformities in their limbs played traditional instruments.\
  \  Even better was that these people were not being treated as tourist attractions.\
  \  I did not see a single person pull out a camera to photograph them.  They were\
  \ treated with respect and dignity by tourists and locals alike.  There were talks\
  \ of programs that the Vietnamese had implemented with no external help to aid in\
  \ the clearing of agent orange in affected areas.  Whilst I was and remain frustrated\
  \ by the lack of support Vietnam is receiving from western nations involved in the\
  \ war, hearing their stories of rebuilding their own country was a testament to\
  \ them as a nation.  No one goes overseas expecting to be overwhelmed with a history\
  \ of despair and I was certainly no exception.  In the end though, I was pleasantly\
  \ surprised.  I fell in love with a country that gets up and goes.  Very few resources,\
  \ but no excuses.  A mentality so many of us could only dream of."
