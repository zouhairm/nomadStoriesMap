Text: "We were standing on the roof terrace when she turned to me and mapped out my\
  \ future. A monsoonal downpour had licked the streets clean and the city unfurled\
  \ itself anew before us. As the night shadows stealthily enveloped us the world\
  \ seemed full of possibility. She had a way of knowing, of truly seeing. I had no\
  \ idea that this would be the last time I saw her alive. She didn't tell me that.\n\
  \nWe had met, months earlier, in the grimy Kathmandu orphanage that she called home.\
  \ Orphanages dotted the twisting alleys of the city, springing up overnight like\
  \ mushrooms in the richly fertile valley soil. The kids that spilled from their\
  \ doors had been lured from their faraway homes and fed tales of false hope until\
  \ their little bellies were full. \n\nBack then I was a bright eyed bideshi, emerging\
  \ once again into Kathmandu's stifling pre-monsoon heat. As the city rushed up to\
  \ meet me and the plane thudded onto the tarmac I allowed myself to slip on the\
  \ rose tinted glasses once again.\n\nI staked out the familiar path along the banks\
  \ of the Bishnumati River; once a spiritual life blood, now a polluted slick of\
  \ debris snaking its way through the city's western arc. As I crossed the threshold\
  \ of the courtyard she caught my eye - hunched in on herself, matted hair curtaining\
  \ her face off from the world. She doesn't talk they said. Or eat. Or go to school.\
  \ We call her Gita.\n\nBut she did speak. Slowly we began to unravel some of her\
  \ story. She had been found, like so many others in a country continually ranked\
  \ amongst the world's poorest, barely surviving on the streets. Escaping the cycle\
  \ of trafficking had left her to spend her days under the giant stupa that watched\
  \ over the city with its all seeing Buddha eyes. Gita, just like the city before\
  \ her, took me into her battered heart and forced me to look her in the eyes. She\
  \ taught me to truly see.\n\nI finally boarded my flight home just as the golden\
  \ spring light slinked its way into the valley. As the plane lifted towards the\
  \ sudden blaze of sunshine I bid Gita and Kathmandu goodbye. Her sudden death had\
  \ cracked me right open to all of the pain, searing hope and fragility of life.\
  \ It was like being handed a blank map with no point of reference. \n\nYet somehow\
  \ this map would always lead me back to her. Years later, in another part of the\
  \ city she had called home, I had her name pricked into my skin with a throbbing\
  \ needle. I emerged anew from the tattoo parlour just as the storm clouds rolled\
  \ in once again from the mountains."
