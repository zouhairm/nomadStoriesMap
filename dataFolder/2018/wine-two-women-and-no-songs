Text: "It\u2019s my second time in Cape Town. A friend is starting a wine concierge\
  \ business and is here to do her business research.  Wine and I are long-time friends,\
  \ so naturally I am supportive.  \n\nOn a grey and drizzly day we drive to Hermanus\
  \ from Green Point in Cape Town, where we are staying. It\u2019s cold and the body\
  \ is not fully awake. Still, side-kick duties call and my friend is here to work\
  \ and so I sit on the deck at Hamilton Russel wines and taste young wines from the\
  \ Ashbourne range.  We taste the Pinot Noir and marvel at how amazing all the wines\
  \ are on the nose, all their potential hidden in the bottle, I think; you need a\
  \ different kind of mouth to taste the grapes in wine.  What is umami, sweet, salt,\
  \ what is sour, what is bitter.  You must smell plums and cherries and coffee, cut\
  \ grass, green pepper and citrus.  Looking up in the direction of the big house,\
  \ where the owners are upholding their grandfather\u2019s hard work, now theirs\
  \ \u2013 an idyll, who do you pay before you are born, to have a life like this?\
  \  \n\nAt Bouchard Finlayson, we have saved the best for last.  It\u2019s the typical\
  \ low white-washed bungalows surrounded by green perfection.  Inside the warm lighting\
  \ feels special and makes the ambiance feel hushed and sophisticated.  We are given\
  \ specialised attention which includes all the wines in the tasting range plus a\
  \ beautiful Mediterranean taster platter of hams, cheeses, olives and bread \u2013\
  \ all from the farm or nearby.  I am not shy about food so I am truly appreciative\
  \ of the gesture and don\u2019t hide it.  We start with the Blanc De Mer \u2013\
  \ a good wine to get one\u2019s foot in the door, and then the Crocodile\u2019s\
  \ Lair Chardonnay brings youth, spring happiness and sunshine into my mouth.  The\
  \ limited edition Chardonnay that follows has understated layers that present themselves\
  \ with calm confidence and sophistication while the Missionvale is all sweet and\
  \ delicious things.  It is on this day, that I finally find Pinot Noirs that I will\
  \ drink with joy; The Galpin\u2019s Peak and the somewhat pricey T\xE9te de Cuv\xE9\
  e (that changes from vintage to vintage.)  The Hannibal is very manly on the nose,\
  \ a wine drunk in oak-panelled leather-seating English gentlemen\u2019s clubs. \
  \ I take some time to think about this wine.  We could be friends.  The first introduction\
  \ came on a bit strong but this is a getting to know you kind of wine."
