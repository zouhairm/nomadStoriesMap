Text: "Have you ever wondered if a particular generalized perspective was inaccurate,\
  \ or perhaps your differing experience with said perspective is simply an anomaly?\
  \ When it comes to the American perspective on French hospitality, I have legitimate\
  \ internal philosophical quandaries about this very thing. Now, I realize I'm not\
  \ exactly an ordinary gal with typical thought trains like, \u201CMaybe I shouldn't\
  \ have opted out of that vision insurance...\u201D Or, \u201CWill I realistically\
  \ be able to pay off my student loans before I die?\u201D But despite all of the\
  \ conventions surrounding my questionable normalcy, every time someone comments\
  \ on how rude or stuck-up the French are, I end up spending the next twenty-or-so\
  \ minutes trying to convince them otherwise.\n The notion that the French demeanor\
  \ is anything but warm and welcoming seems to be a permeating part of our American\
  \ consciousness. Because people tend to believe first-hand accounts over ambiguous\
  \ ideas, I've grown accustomed to using my travels as evidence to counter their\
  \ skepticism. Sometimes, I'll open with the story of the older lady in Rennes who\
  \ worked at the language school I was attending, and my memories of her. I love\
  \ recalling how after having me over for dinner on random week nights, she would\
  \ dance around with her nightly espresso or cognac in hand, crooning Kimya Dawson\
  \ ballads to her beloved tuxedo cat, Max. Or maybe I'll tell them about the couple\
  \ I rented a room from out in the Rh\xF4ne Valley, and how they would invite me\
  \ up for champagne and p\xE2t\xE9 on the weekends so we could talk about politics\
  \ and traveling. If they remain unconvinced, I'll divulge my favorite encounter\
  \ with the elderly couple I met while grocery shopping in Arles, and how they ended\
  \ up driving me all over the city so that they could show me the old Roman aqueducts\
  \ and point out the best cafes and patisseries.\n After I've talked this poor, unsuspecting\
  \ person's ear off for the better part of half an hour about all the amazingly hospitable\
  \ people I met while in France, I'm usually met with a puzzled look and not-so-subtle\
  \ subject change. Enter the internal philosophical quandary that I opened this rant\
  \ with: did I just get lucky and happen upon a series of friendly and warm French\
  \ people? Perhaps. Or, maybe, just maybe, if one is to leave all reservations and\
  \ hesitations behind on the airport tarmac, you can open yourself up to experiences\
  \ that can never be captured in any guidebook."
