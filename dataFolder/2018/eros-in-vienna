Text: "\u201CBut Liz,\u201D Nasima said outside the Forever 21 store in Vienna, \u201C\
  homosexuals rape boys!\u201D\n\n\u201CWhy would you say that?\u201D I was stunned\
  \ by her ignorance.\n\nBut I knew that in her country, Afghanistan, bacha bazi has\
  \ existed throughout history. Young boys dance for the entertainment of elders,\
  \ often warlords, in what is in reality sex slavery.\n\nAll I could do was reassure\
  \ her that the handsome Spanish man in the beret with a dachshund named Eros was\
  \ not a rapist. I was delighted to meet him, since I, too, am an obsessed owner\
  \ of a dachshund, Henry Longfellow, back in New York City. He travels the world\
  \ with Eros, staying in five-star hotels and writing a travel blog. http://dogfriendlytraveler.com/\n\
  \nHow I came to be in Vienna that fall day in 2015 is an incredible story. Working\
  \ as a  mentor for an online writing program designed to help Afghan women tell\
  \ their stories to the world, I had tutored Nasima. I was shocked by all she had\
  \ endured --  a forced marriage as a teenager, brutal abuse, and an escape to Kabul\
  \ with her infant son.\n\nSomehow, she managed to get a college degree and a job\
  \ with an NGO that sent her to a human rights conference in Vienna in July 2015.\
  \ Leaving her 9-year-old son Omid in hiding with her mother, she had decided to\
  \ seek asylum in Austria. Her timing could not have been worse; that summer over\
  \ 700,000 refugees passed through Austria, with 300,000 in Vienna. Nasima knew no\
  \ one in Austria and was sent to a sweltering refugee camp, a woman alone under\
  \ great danger. She sent me a desperate email, and within hours, I had reached my\
  \ friends Hans and Vroni.\n\nCatholic activists, motivated by a desire to help others,\
  \ this couple in their late 60s took Nasima into their home, a vast, antique-filled,\
  \ rent-controlled apartment next to Vienna's St. Stephen\u2019s Cathedral that had\
  \ been Vroni\u2019s childhood home.\n\nThat day, after seeing the joy on Nasima\u2019\
  s face when I let her select a winter wardrobe, we decided to head to a caf\xE9\
  . Our encounter with Eros sidetracked us, since I am naturally gregarious and endlessly\
  \ curious. I naively expected Nasima to share my delight in this local connection.\
  \ Not only was she fearful of homosexuals, she also found dogs disgusting \u2013\
  \ the concept of Eros in elegant restaurants and stores was beyond her comprehension.\
  \ In her country, dogs are considered vile and dirty and are kept solely for protection.\n\
  \n\u201CNasima,\u201D I told her, \u201Cone day, you will have gay friends, and\
  \ you will love dogs!\u201D"
