Text: "It was a cold autumn\u2019s morning, I could see the brown crispy leaves on\
  \ my windowsill \u2013 I turned slightly and there he was. A tall man, fair skin,\
  \ and dark hair. I realised it had been my third one-night stand for the week. But\
  \ for some reason, this one felt different. I didn\u2019t chase him out of my house,\
  \ I shifted over instead so that my calf touched his. In my head, I questioned my\
  \ movements but tried justifying it by saying \u201Cthis is the last one\u201D \u2013\
  \ when I knew I\u2019d probably repeat my actions next week. I positioned myself\
  \ correctly so that I looked like sleeping beauty by the time he opened his eyes.\
  \ It took quite a while, I even fell asleep again \u2013 clearly it was a great\
  \ night.  \n\nI felt a soft sensation against my lips, with a slow whisper \u201C\
  good morning beautiful\u201D. I froze immediately. Normally these guys pick up their\
  \ belongings and run to the exit, but not today, I must have done something right\
  \ here.  \n\nLet me take you to the beginning of my night. It started off with pre-drinks\
  \ at the local pub down the road from my apartment. One sex on the beach cocktail\
  \ led to 5 more, and there I was, deep in conversation with number 3 \u2013 I\u2019\
  m calling him number 3 because he was the third of the week. Let me hang my head\
  \ in shame now. One thing led to another and there we were, breaking down my front\
  \ door trying not to wake the neighbours. \nWe all, of course, know where that went\
  \ to. \n\nLong story short \u2013 I\u2019m now locked in his arms, staring into\
  \ his dark eyes barely able to say good morning back to him. I tried and stuttered\
  \ good morning back to him. Of course, it\u2019s a bit awkward because we don't\
  \ know each other. I wiggle a bit further back from his face and tell him what an\
  \ amazing night I had and that I\u2019ve never seen him at the pub before last night.\
  \ He giggled slightly and I, of course, melted because this is the first time \u201C\
  the morning after\u201D lasted this long. \n\nTo me this is a sign, I haven\u2019\
  t asked him to leave yet and he too didn\u2019t volunteer to go. I kept asking myself,\
  \ is this it? Is this him? But of course, the harsh reality kicked in and sat on\
  \ my shoulders screaming into my ears \u201CHE IS NUMBER 3! \u201C at this point,\
  \ I just did not care. \nNumber 3 eventually starts to explain,\u201Cwell I\u2019\
  m down here looking for my sister, I'm Blake by the way\u201D \u2013 at this moment\
  \ I\u2019m having mini heart palpitations, because my long last brother had been\
  \ searching for me and hasn\u2019t told me when he plans to arrive, I have no idea\
  \ what he looks like all I know is that his name is Blake."
