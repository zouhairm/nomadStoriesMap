Text: "Brooklyn had me grinding my teeth and falling down stairs. The winds of the\
  \ polar vortex were unbearably cold. I found some comfort settling in every night\
  \ with Art Davidson\u2019s story of the first winter ascent of Denali. He made the\
  \ cold seem relative. To be overcome. By March, however, my body forced me to seek\
  \ help. I left New York City the same way I said goodbye to Mumbai. Silent. My mistakes\
  \ catching up to me.\n\nI went back to Norfolk, VA to see doctor. She started a\
  \ treatment loaded with side effects and suggested I stay in Virginia. It led to\
  \ depressing years sinking with the rest of the US Southeast. With my dreams drifting\
  \ off shore, and my healthcare solutions hopeless as the plans to save the city\
  \ from the tide, I planned my escape applying for a job counting birds in Chugach,\
  \ AK.\n\nAfter interviews, US Fish & Wildlife asked me to help with a bilingual\
  \ mission speaking on bird conservation in parks, refuges, and schools from San\
  \ Diego, CA to Fairbanks, AK. I flew to San Diego days later and met my travel partner,\
  \ Jean, at the airport.\n\nWe warmed up to each other during training in the Gaslamp\
  \ District. He told me he was gay abruptly one night over drinks. Perhaps challenging\
  \ whatever prejudices I held before we began. I let him know it changed nothing\
  \ and told him what I was hiding. I was still recovering from the damage of multiple\
  \ sclerosis. Denali bound, we drank to shared secrets that should not be secret.\n\
  \nWe spent those months campers on a campaign. Experts researching birds showed\
  \ us their methods. Daily speaking events asked me to use more Spanish in public\
  \ than ever before. We saw birds in their entire splendor along the Columbia River\
  \ where the roar of thousands of cranes met us a mile before we saw them on the\
  \ water.\n\nThe decision to travel so soon did prove reckless. Withdrawal from my\
  \ medications began in Oregon, and I started losing my balance shortly after. Many\
  \ of the trip\u2019s nights were spent in a sleeping bag filled with pain I hoped\
  \ would pass. I knew it could be dangerous stopping my drugs all at once, but whose\
  \ body was this if I could not compel it to act?\n\nThankfully, I persisted all\
  \ the way to Denali. Arctic Terns, dipping for food in the water around us while\
  \ we rafted the Kenai River, were a rewarding and humbling sight. They dwarfed our\
  \ travel distance by thousands of miles and showed grace in their struggle. My health\
  \ concerns proved only hurdles in the endless sunlight of Alaskan summer. Placed\
  \ before me to be overcome."
