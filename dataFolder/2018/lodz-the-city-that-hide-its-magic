Text: 'It was a routine day when I received a call telling me if I would spend a week
  somewhere in Poland.And I am saying somewhere because I didn''t understand which
  city my teacher was talking about,but I accepted immediately the offer and I searched
  about the highly uncommon destination, that I couldn''t read it well until a local
  taught me the correct pronunciation.But that uncertainty made me very eager to get
  a response to my question:why this city?

  The day to set off arrived,so I will tell you that my stop was the city of Lodz,
  located around 120 km from Warsaw in the south.We landed at the capital''s airport
  while I was getting a glimpse of what would I do without much of hope,but it was
  time to see what Lodz had to offer,and It really surprised me how such an important
  city for Poland would be so unnoticed by almost every traveler. Really.It may be
  because of its dramatic past. But all of these parts of the past now coexist with
  the modern world in perfect harmony, and Lodz (it is read like "Uch") is now a modernized
  city that has not forget Its roots, preserving all their history in wonderful museums
  that make everyone to be aware of how many things these people had to overcome in
  its long journey to become a reference in arts studies and industrial business.This
  city is the home to some of the most prestigious institutions in film and theatre
  studies and it is also the main place of fashion in Poland.All the brands will meet
  you at the stunning Piotrkowska street.A 5km long shopping street with those European
  buildings from the 18th Century reconverted in modern restaurants and pubs,that
  will lead you to the main building:Manufaktura. One of the biggest shopping centers
  in the country finalizes the largest shopping street in the world.Also,the trains
  get that magic as there were no electronic devices of any type,even the crew had
  to go seat by seat to confirm the tickets were paid like we were in the mid-30s.A
  good example of how the ideas of the Industrial Revolution spread across Europe.However,an
  important part of the agricultural Lodz was still safe and sound, and with a great
  future ahead thanks to the incorporation of state of the art technology.We must
  include salt mining,with wonderful underground landscapes to visit.

  Lodz is like a city with an introvert character,wanting to preserve its magic to
  the people who actually give it a go,a mystery that I couldn''t resist resolving.A
  place to admire the best of European culture for much less money.'
