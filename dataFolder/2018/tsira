Text: "As Tsira stepped into the courtyard of the Svetitskhoveli Cathedral, I could\
  \ hear her heart fluttering on its own wings. She was finally in her Mecca. Each\
  \ corner, each stone, each mural, I knew, was familiar to her from the tales she\
  \ had heard. Her beautiful blue eyes gleamed with a thousand untold stories, a million\
  \ unsaid prayers. \nAs I looked at her radiant face, I realized there were more\
  \ that brought us together than the eye could see. Nothing united us more like the\
  \ minds of two imprisoned travellers. Two nomads who did not have the privilege\
  \ to wander on their freewill, but had yet crossed boundaries to be where they are\
  \ now. While I travelled across seas to break free of a family with cloistered,\
  \ dark-age beliefs, she defeated her weakening body simply by having the will to\
  \ push forward.  \nHer face beamed in the sunlight as she stood taking in the lush,\
  \ green mountains surrounding the church and the peaceful, white clouds casting\
  \ a shadow on the grass. With the church situated on the top of a mountain, we felt\
  \ closer to the heavens than ever. Tourists walked around, talking loudly and clicking\
  \ pictures. \nBut in Tsira\u2019s mind, a silent reel was running. Of the miracles\
  \ of the Life Giving Pillar, of how St. Nino interceded for the believers, of Her\
  \ grapevine cross, of the healing of many\u2026 \nTsira was too young to question\
  \ the stories, but she understood this. Whether she was healed or not, she could\
  \ now rest in peace. There were other dreams, other plans. But nothing mattered\
  \ as much as this. All those could wait. She had accomplished the ambition of her\
  \ brief life. \nI left her hands as she walked into the ancient church all by herself.\
  \ There was nothing in there that could hurt her. Instead, I called upon all the\
  \ holy forces that the church was abode to, and asked them to protect the little\
  \ girl that went inside. Of course, I was the age to question things, but faith\
  \ as small as a mustard seed can move mountains, they said. \nFor a young doctor\
  \ aspirant who had travelled all the way from India on scholarship, Tsira was not\
  \ just the daughter of the hostel maid. I was her storyteller, and she was mine.\
  \ I had a ticket in my pocket that would take me back to Kerala soon, and I didn\u2019\
  t know if I would ever meet Tsira again. I didn\u2019t even know if she would make\
  \ it to her eleventh birthday. \nI don\u2019t know what waited for her \u2013 and\
  \ for me \u2013 in the days ahead. But for now, standing in the place of her many\
  \ dreams and prayers, I knew that both of us were covered."
