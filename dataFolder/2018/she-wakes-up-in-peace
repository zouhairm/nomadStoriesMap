Text: "\u201CAllahu akbar, Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar.\u201D Here there\
  \ is no need for an alarm. Especially in the corner room across from the Ali Matan\
  \ Mosque. Life revolves around prayer time. Now is Fajr, the first prayer of the\
  \ morning, and while I would love to sleep past 5am, I fear it will not be a long\
  \ respite until Shorook at around 6am. It will be a long day today, I should get\
  \ started. By the time I am done with my shower Omar will have returned from the\
  \ mosque and start preparing the morning chai. \n\nLeaving my room and approaching\
  \ the third-floor balcony that overlooked the hotel foyer, I called to Omar to set\
  \ me a table for tea. \u201CI will be back shortly Omar, thank you!\u201D With this,\
  \ I launched up the final flight of stairs to the roof, and just then, bands of\
  \ orange and red were beginning to mark the place of the Sun\u2019s eventual ascent\
  \ over those hills. Those hills housed one of man\u2019s oldest art galleries: Laas\
  \ Geel. Those artists watched sunrises here long before I arrived on this earth.\
  \ Camera ready, I intended to capture those first rays of light to cut across the\
  \ Hargeisan skyline. But, I didn\u2019t.\n\nSomething was wrong. I put my camera\
  \ down. There was nothing wrong with the camera but something was off. No honking,\
  \ no foul smell, no yelling. None of the negative characteristics that seem to plague\
  \ most African cities. No, not Hargeisa she wakes up in peace. Well, after Fajr\
  \ anyways.  Instead the air is perfumed with the unique blend of teas, spices, and\
  \ for better or worse camel\u2019s milk that constitute Somalia\u2019s best kept\
  \ secret. Instead of yelling, gentle conversations and footsteps are all the shop\
  \ keepers need to open up. And where is the waste water? \n\nNo film, no digital\
  \ sensor could capture the intense calm of Hargeisa at this hour. One must feel\
  \ it. It was the last thing I expected, but maps and rumors do leave a lot to be\
  \ desired after all.\n\nWait! I\u2019m missing something! I had forgotten my tea\
  \ and Omar downstairs! He thought I had gotten lost. I assured him the only place\
  \ I was lost was in my mind. The joke was lost on him. I sipped my tea, and the\
  \ feeling was complete. The feeling of Hargeisa.\n\nNow the day can begin."
