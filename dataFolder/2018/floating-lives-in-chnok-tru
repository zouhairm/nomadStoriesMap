Text: "With eyes closed, I savored the sensation of swaying with the creaking house.\
  \ I could hear the sound of rotor blades cutting through the waters and the squeal\
  \ of laughter from children nimbly hopping from one wooden plank to another. As\
  \ feet pattered around my prone figure, I grudgingly wake by pulling myself up into\
  \ a lotus position. Ah, it\u2019s a new day in Chnok Tru, a floating village on\
  \ the Tonle Sap.\n\nOne of the dominant physical landforms, the Tonle Sap is the\
  \ largest freshwater lake in Cambodia. With the Tonle Sap River connecting it to\
  \ the Mekong River, the Tonle Sap acts as a buffer for the fluctuations in water\
  \ volume experienced by the Mekong River during the wet and dry seasons. During\
  \ the wet season, the scattering of islands throughout the Tonle Sap transforms\
  \ into a flat and continuous watery landscape. Trees that once stood tall became\
  \ shrubs as the water level relentlessly rises. \n\nOn my first day, I attempted\
  \ to greet my Cambodian hosts, a couple in their thirties with their four children,\
  \ with my non-existent Khmer. When my Cambodian buddy and I climbed aboard from\
  \ the boat, their small house became significantly cramped.\n\nJust like others\
  \ in the village, my hosts fish for a living while moonlighting as farmers, especially\
  \ during the dry season. How do they farm during the wet season then?\n\nI received\
  \ the answer unexpectedly during lunch the next day. As I savored the fish gravy\
  \ with an assortment of vegetables my host whipped up, I mimicked how delicious\
  \ the food was.\n\n\u201CI grew them.\" She proudly replies, pointing at the vegetables.\
  \ \"They\u2019re from the garden.\u201D\n\nShe beckons me to follow her to the back\
  \ porch. From there, I saw styrofoam boxes filled with crops packed on a faded sampan\
  \ anchored to their woodshed. From basil leaves to aloe vera, I saw how farming\
  \ was possible even without land. \n\nFor a water-based community, Chnok Tru was\
  \ unexpectedly green with at least a floating garden present in every household.\
  \ Lightweight vegetables, like water greens, are usually grown; however, if consideration\
  \ is given towards the time required for plants to mature, heavier plants like pumpkins\
  \ can still be cultivated. \n\nAs I prepared to head back to land, the vivid splashes\
  \ of green I see on water are a testimony to the villagers' resourcefulness and\
  \ creativity. When there isn't land available, floating gardens were created to\
  \ supplement their income and diet. Just like water, they adapt to their environment,\
  \ making them resilient and strong."
