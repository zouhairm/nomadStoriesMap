Text: "We drove through winding roads up the mountainside, inland, where the crops\
  \ had previously been cultivated and now neighborhoods sleepy and abundant lay.\
  \ A place where the jungle seemed to either remain or reclaim its wild abandon (or\
  \ both) with a small, easy to miss sign, implored us to turn and we continued up\
  \ another part of the hill to stone walls, fencing, a parking lot, and a fair amount\
  \ of people at a dead end road.\n Standing at the edge of a wall slightly out of\
  \ view of the waterfall, propped against the stones, was a man, clearly local, weaving\
  \ a palm frond into a basket. Along the wall he stood against were finished palm\
  \ baskets he had for sale. \n \"How do you make your baskets if you don\u2019t mind\
  \ me asking?\u201D He, however, didn't mind at all, whether through the magic of\
  \ the island or his own temperament. He was actually excited to talk about his baskets.\n\
  \ He showed me a palm frond and cut part of the frond so it made a thin strip with\
  \ the fronds on it. The center of the frond that had been cut out he threw back\
  \ to the jungle behind him, \u201CWe always give something back to the jungle.\u201D\
  \ It was about respect for the earth that provided him, about reciprocity. He took\
  \ the frond and made a circle with the flat edge of the palm and used the fronds\
  \ to make the bottom and started working up the edges. As he did this, he told me\
  \ that when he was a child, he had watched his father weaving baskets and wanted\
  \ to learn. His father had learned from his grandmother even though boys typically\
  \ didn\u2019t learn to weave. He was preserving his ancestors\u2019 knowledge by\
  \ continuing to weave and felt the continuation of both his father and grandmother\
  \ in each basket woven. He said he hopped around these beautiful spots and made\
  \ baskets on his free time because this was his relaxation. Maybe someday he could\
  \ just do this full time. I praised his work and wished him the realization of his\
  \ dreams.\n Most passerbys didn\u2019t even take much notice of him, engrossed in\
  \ the wondrous scenery around them. But here was someone making beautiful things,\
  \ preserving an identity still under threat for a lifestyle so many had lost, been\
  \ forced to abandon, or now fought to retain. This was an act of resistance, of\
  \ reclamation, and a movement of beauty and love in a land known for both its beauty\
  \ and love.\nAnd I left, as the waterfall roared, the nene birds honked, the jungle\
  \ whispered to the rain that fell, and the man wove on with the friends of natural\
  \ spirit around him."
