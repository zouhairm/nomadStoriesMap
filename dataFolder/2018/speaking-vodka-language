Text: "I was looking for my seat in a 2nd-class train when I heard a loud whisper:\
  \ \u2018Americans\u2019\u2026 I looked left and saw a company of 4 guys sitting\
  \ around a small table with a bottle of vodka on it. Their unfriendly faces looked\
  \ straight upon our team of 3 Americans and me \u2013 Russian girl who had decided\
  \ to join these foreigners in their trip to Siberia. Russians - Americans \u2013\
  \ an old story, you know\u2026 \n\n- Hey, they are my friends! \u2013 I said to\
  \ the biggest and the least-friendly man at the table. They were surprised to hear\
  \ me speaking Russian.\n- Okay-okay! Are they real Americans? \u2013 he asked with\
  \ a curiosity. \n\nThe train was about to leave for the longest railroad-trip on\
  \ Earth: from Moscow to Vladivostok \u2013 more than 9000 km. Sometimes you can\
  \ meet here some courageous travelers who dare to cross the continent by train but\
  \ most off the passengers are simple Russian workers who travel home for holidays.\
  \ They work in Moscow because they are unable to find a job in their home towns\
  \ and they see their families only 28 days a year. None of them speak languages\
  \ and most of them have never seen foreigners in the entire life. Just on TV.\n\n\
  The same evening in the train I was getting ready to sleep. On my way to the bathroom\
  \ I saw my friend Jordan sitting on a couch with those Russian guys. It was a lively\
  \ discussion though they spoke Vodka language.\n\n- Is everything ok, Jordan? \u2013\
  \ I asked.\n\n- Everything is cool! - he smiled, holding a shot of vodka, - Don\u2019\
  t worry.\n \nSo here I am the next morning: the same train, the same journey from\
  \ my couch to the bathroom. And what do I see? Jordan is sitting at the same exact\
  \ place as if he hasn\u2019t slept at all! The only one detail has changed: instead\
  \ of the Vodka shot he has a can of beer in one hand and a chicken leg in the other.\
  \ And a CSKA (Russian soccer team) scarf on him!\n\n- Wow!  How did you get it?\n\
  - This is a present to my American best friend Jordan! - answers that creepy Russian\
  \ from yesterday.\n\nTrain stopped for about 10 minutes and another Russian ran\
  \ off to get his own present to Jordan: a very special sort of beer. \nThat\u2019\
  s how \u2018Americans\u2019 bestie\u2019 contest has begun..."
