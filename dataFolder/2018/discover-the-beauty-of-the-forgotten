Text: "There are certain cities and countries that have become very touristic and\
  \ there is a marked route of what you have to see. After you have seen all those\
  \ places you realise that the beauty is on the places nobody talks about. I want\
  \ to talk about those forgotten places, the ignored places that hold purity and\
  \ true culture aspects instead of stereotypes. I am Dutch-Mexican and I don't wear\
  \ clugs and a huge hat for travel (only as a pijama). I want to photograph and write\
  \ about details of places, textures of some walls (it says a lot! how well taken\
  \ care of places are or not), the main transport medium, the expression of people\
  \ going to work in the morning. I want to study life at certain places, not to make\
  \ it more touristic, but to keep the stories true.\n\nI went to Cuba 1.5 years ago\
  \ and the experience was very double, decadence and decay at the same place. On\
  \ this link is the blog post.\nhttps://www.anahiclemens.net/single-post/2016/01/14/Havana-Beautiful-Decadence\n\
  \nOne of the images got to be exhibited at the carrousel du Louvre in Paris, I never\
  \ even dare to dream this would happen!\nI wish to photograph and express other\
  \ places through my eyes and writing. Last week I was in a town in Germany which\
  \ is not even on most maps and it was one of the best experiences of the year! Going\
  \ back to the fact that  you just have to speak German because they won't speak\
  \ english, the dance of the hands trying to explain a concept and then laughter\
  \ after realising that concept does not even exist in any other language. There\
  \ was a beautiful 700 year old tower for salt processing and the salt felt on plants,\
  \ making them look petrified. Nobody knows about this place and the fact of being\
  \ there made me feel so lucky! That is just the country next door, imagine what\
  \ else is there to discover! Of course, part of the beauty is to keep it in secret\
  \ but it is my vocation to frame the world as the piece of art it is so I had to\
  \ write about it. I think this experiences awake a little spark in people to go\
  \ discover further than the overpopulated cities. This does not mean you have to\
  \ say good bye to the world but the opposite! It feels more like looking closer\
  \ into it.\n\nThat is my story for now. Thank you for reading! \nAnah\xED Clemens\n\
