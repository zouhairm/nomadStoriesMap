Text: "Day 8: Though I love most days on the trek, I think the nights are my favorite.\
  \ Once the sun goes down, they light the fire in the dining hall, and that's where\
  \ everyone congregates. The favorite pastime is hanging trail-sweaty gear in front\
  \ of the stove while reading. The Chinese, the German Amazon, and the Swedes are\
  \ in that camp. There's a clump of Nepali guides warming themselves on the other\
  \ side of the circle, but what they're discussing? I don't know.  Probably the cute\
  \ Danish girls. They've made quite a commotion among guides and porters. The trekkers\
  \ have been affected too, of course. The guy from the U.S. Air Force is teaching\
  \ his guide the Rubik's Cube. The sweet little fifty-something Chinese-American\
  \ lady regales me with stories of her daughter that went to NYU for undergrad and\
  \ UVA for law school. Now that the daughter is out of school, Mom can live her life\
  \ to the fullest. This is one helluva first step. My buddy Brian Kelly from...you\
  \ guessed it...Ireland, is here to do Everest, then he's spending two weeks in a\
  \ monastery in Delhi. He's looking for something and he figured the best place to\
  \ find it was inside himself. \n\nI'm in the corner, in as much light as I can muster,\
  \ writing it all down. There's a light soundtrack going--if not Indian, it's very\
  \ heavily influenced. It's loud enough to notice, but not so loud you can't hear\
  \ your neighbor's story. The smell of burning firewood pervades the place and it\
  \ fits--plywood floors, rough-hewn support columns, cylindrical iron stove. Long\
  \ tables line the walls, bench seating upholstered with shabby tapestries that have\
  \ seated a million weary travelers. Large windows cover two of the four walls, providing\
  \ jaw-dropping, squinting views of the snow-clad Himalayas. There's a trade-off,\
  \ though. The closer you get to the windows, the further you are from the fire.\
  \  \n\nAt every lodge where we've stayed, there have been dozens of stickers on\
  \ the windows: guide services, trek equipment sales, tour groups. I wish I'd known.\
  \ I'd've papered this place with Crimson Tide paraphernalia from start to finish.\n\
  \nOh, hey--Air Force figured it out. Good job, brother. And the German Amazon broke\
  \ her chair. Saw that comin'.\n\nThe clouds are rolling in, but I am safely, warmly,\
  \ blissfully shielded with my trek family in the dining room. There's no meat in\
  \ the house, so buffalo kofta is out.  Looks like vegetable curry again. Worse things\
  \ have happened.  In a nation that leans more toward vegetarianism, I'm in good\
  \ hands."
