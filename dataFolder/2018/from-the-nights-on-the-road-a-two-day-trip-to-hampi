Text: "What a Day it was! If asked 'bout it in the afternoon, I might have barked\
  \ at you. I was drained and frustrated all day. Till the clock struck five in the\
  \ evening, Hampi offered me nothing I wanted.  Was late for my planned sunrise shoot,\
  \ over-paying auto-rickshaw tour guide\u200A\u2014\u200Awhom I didn\u2019t wished\
  \ for in first place. After ten in the morning, those bouldery-landscapes were damn\
  \ hot. Felt like a typical sight-seeing trip\u200A\u2014\u200Ahot, boring, tiring\
  \ and huge crowd running all around. No sign of fun noted. Couldn\u2019t capture\
  \ good photographs of temples. Every place was heavely crowded. Even food failed\
  \ to lift our moods. By half-past four, with our soulless bodies, heading towards\
  \ our last spot\u2014\u200AThe Virupaksha Temple. Running all over Hampi since 6:30\
  \ in the morning my inner fears made things worse. It was a lost fight till then.\
  \  Paying 500 bucks for the auto-rickshaw\u200A\u2014 for four of us\u200A\u2014\
  \u200Aand arguing 'bout the visit to the temple today were the last shitty things\
  \ we did. And I cherish the decision to go in . After all, it was the temple of\
  \ Lord Shiva and they always offered me something more and special . I wasn\u2019\
  t wrong. That 1 hour in the Virupaksha temple\u200A\u2014\u200Ayes, we were there\
  \ for an hour\u200A\u2014\u200Acleansed each bit of negativity from us. The temple\
  \ had a surprise in each corner. The troop of monkeys , Lakshmi\u200A\u2014\u200A\
  the temple\u2019s prime elephant, the paintings of Lord Shiva\u2019s alliance with\
  \ Pampa Devi, the temple\u2019s serene Koneru (stepped water tank), everything\u200A\
  \u2014\u200Athough typical to every major South-Indian temple\u200A\u2014\u200A\
  had an aura of its own. These draw you to a loop for hours. And it was just the\
  \ start.\n\nNext, we had to cross the river. As we made our way through the bushes\
  \ into the village, a signboard saying \u201CVirupapura Gaddi,\u201D welcomed us.\
  \ And it's another world altogether. German bakeries, Israeli restaurants, climbing\
  \ schools and fields all over the place; it's like the backpacker\u2019s paradise.\
  \ Soon we made our way into Dudu\u2019s Cafe and tried some Israeli origins; which\
  \ filled both our bellies and souls. After an hour, we found ourselves exploring\
  \ the place and succeeded in our hunt for a budget stay. Got freshed up and walked\
  \ into another restaurant ready to fill our souls again. After all, it was the rest\
  \ mode, and this time it was Schnitzel with some great live music. Ah! Life.\n\n\
  \u201C And now, after all the fears of this trip getting worse, I sit here, charging\
  \ my body and battery pack wondering what\u2019s more in store and wishing not to\
  \ leave this place as early as tomorrow.\u201D"
