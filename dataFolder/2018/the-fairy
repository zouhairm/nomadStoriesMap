Text: "At the beginning, it was a about a sunset. Those are worth not missing if you\
  \ come in spring to this hilly country with small and big lakes of all kinds of\
  \ capricious forms. I had to hurry and half-ran along the cart-road that was to\
  \ get me, though the edge of a young pine forest, to the best setting.  Huge boulders\
  \ scattered in the clearings - forgotten in this part of the world by Mother Nature\
  \ in the turmoil of the end of the glace period  \u2013 were adding a kind of a\
  \ fairy touch to the landscape. So when I heard a distinct and hearty \u201CHello\u201D\
  \ behind me, my imagination was already dwelling in some dwarf kingdom. \n\nA small\
  \ though sturdy woman in a faded brown raincoat, with a flowery kerchief round her\
  \ head and kind sparkling eyes, standing on the wayside by a disproportionately\
  \ bulky milk can and smiling at me, could be easily taken for a citizen of a magic\
  \ country. \u201CCan I be of any help for you, dear?\u201D, - she asked. \u201C\
  Diiingdididi\u201D, - I\u2019m listening to a melody performed by a pod of small\
  \ funny birds and trying to figure out whether yesterdays\u2019 bus from town to\
  \ village took me to one of my child\u2019s dreams instead.\n\nI\u2019m not running\
  \ any more \u2013 nobody runs in this peaceful magic country unless something extraordinary\
  \ happens. The milk can, which we carry together now, is softly swaying as we walk\
  \ along the winding cart-road. Anna lives in a retirement home up the hill. The\
  \ old gentry house harboring it has survived the revolution of 1917, while his last\
  \ owner was not that lucky \u2013 a generous philanthropist and a man of indisputable\
  \ reputation among the locals of all social classes, he was killed by the communists.\n\
  \ \n\u201CHe would be glad to know that at least his house is still working for\
  \ good, - she says simply, - we can live there and it provides jobs for the whole\
  \ village\u201D. \nI nod \u2013 jobs are scarce in the area, and the nearby town,\
  \ once a lively transport hub, has indeed never seen back its merchants and travelers\
  \ since the railroad came here in the mid-19th century. \n\nAlmost every day Anna\
  \ would make 3 km each way to help some very old lady from another village. This\
  \ is when her doctor is not against it \u2013 her institution is the one for people\
  \ with special needs, so each inhabitant is also a patient. She feeds her friend\u2019\
  s animals and cooks for her. \u201CI like it, it\u2019s the real stuff.\u201D No,\
  \ of course she wouldn\u2019t ever ask for any pay \u2013 because she is just happy\
  \ she can be of help. \u201CDiiingdididi, - the birds\u2019 song is back in my ear,\
  \ as I am staring at the magic of the sunset - and because she is a Fairy\u201D."
