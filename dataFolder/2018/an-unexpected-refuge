Text: "In the past hour, several locals had passed by. Teens in jeans and hoodies\
  \ chattering in Spanish, casting curious glances my way. Older couples holding each\
  \ other\u2019s hands, maybe afraid I would try to rob them. But the woman with raven-colored\
  \ hair, and skin the shade all sunbathers seek to attain\u2014but a tone common\
  \ in northeastern Patagonia\u2014was walking straight towards me. With purpose,\
  \ worry etched across her forehead, and a smile straining at her mouth. \nI gazed\
  \ down at my iPhone, hoping the rectangular object would transport me away from\
  \ Puerto Madryn\u2014or at least away from the sidewalk on which I sat. The small\
  \ town on the central coast of Argentina had not been my intended destination, but\
  \ after hitching a ride there, and then missing the last bus out, I was trapped.\
  \ On a slab of concrete. At 11 p.m. With only a backpack, a bottle of water, and\
  \ half a package of smashed crackers to keep me company. \nFeaturing free Wi-Fi,\
  \ the library had become my refuge. But with closing time at noon, I was relegated\
  \ to loitering outside. And with the nearest campground more than three miles away\u2014\
  a daunting walk in the dark\u2014I had nowhere else to go. \nLatin music punched\
  \ through the windows of a car rolling by, the bass thumping in time with my heartbeat.\
  \ An aroma of garlic, onions, and slow-roasting beef filled my nostrils. And still,\
  \ the woman strode my way. \nAbout to sling on my pack and find a new place to wait,\
  \ a young girl calling \u201CMama\u201D from behind the woman made me linger. \n\
  The woman turned her head, sending black hair cascading over her shoulder. She laughed,\
  \ and then faced me again. \n\u201CMy daughter and I have seen you here all night.\u201D\
  \ She eyed the lime-green roll mat clipped to the outside of my backpack. \u201C\
  Do you have a place to sleep?\u201D\nIn the cooling night air, my cheeks blazed.\
  \ Spices from the asado grilling nearby caught in my throat. I knew she thought\
  \ I was homeless. And at that moment, I couldn\u2019t argue. \nThrough fractured\
  \ Spanish, I tried to say that I was taking the morning bus to Puerto Piramides,\
  \ and that I would just wait where I was, but she cut me off.\n\u201CYou will stay\
  \ at our house,\u201D she said, her worry lines softening. \u201CYou can eat, shower,\
  \ and sleep in Alma\u2019s bed.\u201D\nThe young girl flashed her small teeth and\
  \ grabbed my hand. \"Yes,\" she repeated a few times. \"And I will sleep on the\
  \ floor.\" \nThe warmth in my cheeks spread throughout my body. I squeezed Alma's\
  \ hand and grinned. At least for that night, Puerto Madryn would be my home."
