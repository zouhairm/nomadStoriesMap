Text: "It was a long, hot day, typical for South India this time of year. By the time\
  \ the sun rose over the palm trees and the pink roofs of the Ashram, hundreds of\
  \ people were already roaming the small dusty roads on their way to morning meditation.\
  \ Very spontaneously, I had extended my stay, and spent a quiet day reading, reflecting,\
  \ meditating. The kind of quietness we barely get in our busy everyday lives, where\
  \ happy hours chase business lunches. Instead, I listened to sounds otherwise overheard,\
  \ thoughts otherwise ignored, I was mindful, peaceful. With that mood, I was just\
  \ about to go to bed, when I got a text from Benzi, who I had shared a deep conversation\
  \ with earlier. He spoke about a funeral in the Ashram, and that everyone was free\
  \ to attend. Sleepy, but increasingly curious, I dressed and went to meet him at\
  \ the main hall.\n\nOne of the Ashram\u2019s elderly residents had naturally passed\
  \ away. We joined a group of 50 or 60 people, seated around the body that was prominently\
  \ placed on a table, covered in white linen except for head and chest. The air was\
  \ filled with silence, incense and the sweet scent of white petals surrounding the\
  \ table in the center. During the ceremony, we were singing a slow, melancholic\
  \ version of \u201COm Namah Shivaya\u201D, one of the most popular Hindu mantras\
  \ dedicated to Lord Shiva. It was eerie, and yet incredibly beautiful. Pure. There\
  \ were no other words, no tears.\n\nEventually, a small procession formed, carrying\
  \ the now completely linen-covered body towards the beach. Carefully being placed\
  \ onto a funeral pyre, he was covered by wood, leaves and oils that would later\
  \ decrease the strong odors. We all stood around the flames, watching as they licked\
  \ higher and higher into the night\u2019s sky. The chanting ceased at last, and\
  \ all we heard was the crackling fire and the breaking waves nearby. Glances and\
  \ faint smiles were exchanged. In that moment, I realized a fundamental truth about\
  \ this experience, that was going to resonate within me for a long time. This funeral\
  \ was not for soothing who was left behind. It was rather about honoring the life\
  \ that has ended. Well, ended in this world maybe, and with benignity sent onwards,\
  \ wherever one believes that is. Death did not primarily mean sorrow for the living,\
  \ but the continuation of a journey for the deceased.\n\nIn the meantime, the heat\
  \ of the day was gone, farewelled by a fresh breeze picking up from the ocean. But\
  \ a warm feeling of communion remained. One that did not need any other word, while\
  \ we silently dispersed into the night."
