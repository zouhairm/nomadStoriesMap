Text: "Despite having a plane that never showed up and rushing to catch a connecting\
  \ flight in a different terminal 20 minutes away by taxi, my sister, Ginny, and\
  \ I made our flight (thankfully due to a delay) to Jaipur in Rajasthan, the Land\
  \ of Colors, in time for the Kite Festival in India. One of Ginny's friends from\
  \ university is from there. We were lucky enough to meet her family in Jaipur. She\
  \ brought us to her grandmother's house to celebrate with a family on the roof.\
  \ One of her uncles let me hold one of his kites. What you are suppose to do is\
  \ cut other people's kites with string that has little bits of glass in it. It is\
  \ an acquired skill. I started moving the kite back and forth. I watched as another\
  \ kite became entangled in my kite. The only thing I kept telling myself is \"Don't\
  \ let the kite get cut, don't let the kite get cut.\" I looked to the uncle nervously\
  \ as this other kite closed in on me. I sheepishly handed the kite back to him,\
  \ \"Oh no, they are cutting your kite.\" He said, \"No, you've just cut a kite!\"\
  \ Another kite got tangled with the line. \"Shoot, this one is cutting me now.\"\
  \ He laughed, \"No, you just cut two kites!\" Within two minutes of holding the\
  \ kite, I cut two kites in my first time. I decided this was the best record to\
  \ have and left the rest of the kite cutting to them. \nLater, we went to the Old\
  \ City, where the Pink City is. Our friend found this alleyway where we climbed\
  \ up a poorly lit staircase to her friend's rooftop party. When we walked outside\
  \ of the dark stairwell, we froze. There were thousands of little paper kites in\
  \ every direction. You couldn't see the sky without seeing kites. We just stood\
  \ there, with dropped jaws, deciding where to look. Spectacles usually grow old,\
  \ yet this just kept getting better and better. Loud music blasted from a gigantic\
  \ speaker ten rooftops away. We watched the sunset as kites became silhouettes against\
  \ the golden sun. As the darkness settled, people began lighting fire lanterns and\
  \ fireworks. It became an everlasting firework show on twenty to thirty rooftops.\
  \ It was like the finale of every Fourth of July show, except it went on for an\
  \ hour and half. I wondered how more people weren't hurt. I kept comparing this\
  \ holiday to our Fourth of July, yet this was even more extreme than the people\
  \ doing fire hula-hoops at Jacksonville Beach in Florida. It was one of the coolest\
  \ things I have ever seen. I will never forget being on a rooftop in the Old City\
  \ in Jaipur during the Kite Festival."
