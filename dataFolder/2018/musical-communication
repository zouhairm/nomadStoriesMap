Text: "After my morning coffee, I walked out of my guest house to explore yet another\
  \ new town, having no expectations to come across any decent communication considering\
  \ the negligence of English language in that region.\n\nThe old historic town of\
  \ Shaxi, once an important trade station on the Old Tea Horse Caravan Road, is one\
  \ of the least visited places in China. Lying on the unbeaten path of usual backpackers,\
  \ it is the perfect place to relax and rewind on the journey.\n\nI watched the shadows\
  \ change as the morning sunlight fell across cobblestones over which horse caravans\
  \ once trod. As I was walking through those old lanes I heard a faint familiar tune.\
  \ It started getting closer as I walked towards the village square \xAC- considered\
  \ by some as one of the most beautiful in China. I found a young local boy with\
  \ long black hair partially covered with an olive bandanna, sitting in the corner\
  \ of the square playing a harmonica with a sunset orange guitar and humming the\
  \ tune of Bob Dylan\u2019s \u2018Blowin\u2019 in the wind\u2019. I approached him\
  \ and sat beside. He paused and greeted me in Mandarin, I smiled back. I tried starting\
  \ a conversation but he could not understand English. \n\nWhile I enjoyed listening\
  \ to him sing out few local songs after humming Dylan, I started wondering how different\
  \ kinds of music travel and reach the very remotest of the places one wouldn\u2019\
  t even expect to find. He paused for a while and looked at me, I pointed at the\
  \ guitar and signaled. He happily offered me the guitar and I started strumming\
  \ some chords. Within a minute he joined me in this musical endeavor. We both played\
  \ as the tension built up without any conversation. In the next minute, we got a\
  \ small audience. We both looked at one another and smiled as we synced to the music.\
  \ That little moment is something both of us would cherish for life which cannot\
  \ be expressed through words.\n\nThere was a beautiful musical bond which breaks\
  \ all barriers of language specially experienced while travelling. Music speaks\
  \ where words fail."
