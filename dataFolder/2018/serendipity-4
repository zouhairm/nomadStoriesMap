Text: "A damp towel drapes over the back of my pack, swinging freely in the cool breeze\
  \ as I walk to the station. I take a moment to hoist the heavy bag to my hips tightening\
  \ the shoulder straps securely. I am thankful once again that I did not pack more\
  \ as a gentle mix of sweat and laundry detergent drifts to my nose. \n\nLater, I\
  \ sat quietly on a padded train seat headed for Milan. There is a middle aged man\
  \ in glasses and a five o\u2019clock shadow sitting in the seat facing me. He wears\
  \ an oversized blue dress shirt, jeans, and sneakers. He is slightly pudgy for an\
  \ Italian, though not overweight, and carries a pensive look on his face. He taps\
  \ away on the computer in his lap, I several times look up to find him pause and\
  \ observe me. I get the distinct impression that he is a writer, and that he is\
  \ adding me to his story. I find great amusement to think on the irony that I may\
  \ be carried into someone\u2019s story at the same instance they are carried in\
  \ to mine.\n\nOn exiting the train in Milan, I make my way to a nearby park bench.\
  \ As I sit, a man in a suit rides up to the bench on an aqua Vespa.  As he pulls\
  \ off his helmet and I see sparkling eyes to match. He drives me by scooter all\
  \ around the dark Milan streets. Wind rushes through my hair and a grin spreads\
  \ over my face.\n\nMatteo mentions that he had accepted to host someone before me,\
  \ but that she had booked a hostel before he could reply to her. I attend a free\
  \ tour next day and a woman named Gol and I strike up a conversation. She is an\
  \ Iranian that had moved to Canada with her family when she was a child. As we talk\
  \ she mentions that she is staying in a nearby hostel and just missed booking with\
  \ a local. Of course the local was Matteo. She and I quickly decided since it seemed\
  \ providence that we meet, we must join Matteo that evening for dinner. And our\
  \ little band of new friends began to form.\n\nThat evening I found myself sitting\
  \ for a delightful meal as we meshed and laughed together as old friends. While\
  \ we walked the city afterwards, I was reminded of something the tour guide had\
  \ said earlier that day. He spoke of serendipity. Serendipity means \u201Ca fortunate\
  \ happenstance\u201D or a \u201Cpleasant surprise\u201D. As I travel these weeks,\
  \ I feel that my life is full of these serendipitous moments with others. And though\
  \ I believe they are arranged from a higher place and are not perhaps as much fortune\
  \ as a plan, I am blown away by the feeling. We are never the same again."
