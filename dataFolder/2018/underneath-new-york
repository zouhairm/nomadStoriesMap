Text: "\u201CYou must come alone,\u201D I heard him say as I tucked my drivers license\
  \ in my vest pocket. I needed to ensure my body could be identified if the inevitable\
  \ happened. I stepped onto the empty streets of Manhattan to meet a man I knew nothing\
  \ about, at a place I swore never to reveal. I knew better than to let my curiosity\
  \ lure me into something so dangerous.\nIt was ten minutes before midnight when\
  \ I neared my destination. I could see him standing alone, his body framed by the\
  \ rays of the street light. His face was hidden in the shadows of a ratty gray hoodie.\
  \ \nI stopped an awkward distance away, but close enough to see the paint splattered\
  \ on his whiskers. The smirk on his face stoked my every fear and he knew it.  \n\
  \u201CWhy do you need to see the Underbelly Project,\u201D he asked, taking a step\
  \ closer to me. Why would a 60-year-old woman fly to New York to chase this underworld\
  \ of graffiti artists? Was I aware of the physical and legal risks of going down\
  \ deep into the bowels of the city? \nI stumbled. Even I found it hard to understand\
  \ the mysterious pull into an abandoned subway station where 103 artists spent a\
  \ year painting. It was a gallery never opened to its patrons.\n\u201CI want to\
  \ see unleashed creativity,\u201D I blurted out in hopes of filling the void. I\
  \ wanted to see how artists paint when not judged, nor paid or commissioned. I wanted\
  \ to inhale the spirit of those willing to gamble their lives to honor their creative\
  \ muse.\nAs we sloshed through a maze of tracks the stench of sewage and mold began\
  \ to erode my courage, the screech of rats nauseated me. I pushed on, climbing a\
  \ ladder into the main belly of the station where I caught sight of the words, \u201C\
  Get Up. Get God.\u201D sprayed in a colorful frenzy. Beyond it I could see walls\
  \ afire with angst and fury. As I walked on, ghoulish souls shrouded in black followed\
  \ me with deathlike stares. Skulls wearing deer antlers, an American flag waving\
  \ its red and white, Mickey Mouse on a respirator, brilliant bubble letters and\
  \ sinister scribblings lit up the dull concrete walls.\n\u201CI could stay down\
  \ here forever,\u201D my guide whispered from behind. \u201CThe peace and serenity\u2026\
  ,\u201D his voice trailing off as I felt a jolt to my core. My peace, the last thing\
  \ I expected to find, was spray painted vividly on these walls, deep underneath\
  \ the frenetic streets of my life.\nI turned to thank my guide but he was gone,\
  \ vanished into thin air. I was alone. Alone on this journey of mine."
