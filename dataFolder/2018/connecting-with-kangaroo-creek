Text: "Forest ranges frame the expansive crescent of Byron Bay. At sunset, Mount Warning\
  \ sits in the orange glow of the horizon, and the ocean is pulled over the rest\
  \ of the world like a sheet of silver. Surfers dance across silky ripples and the\
  \ evenings are balmy. On my summer holidays, I fled Sydney, where I study. I camped\
  \ at the Arts Factory, a hidden tent community of 200 travellers. A weekly talent\
  \ show saw nomads strum, sing and blow didgeridoos. Their musical skills honed by\
  \ travel, often pivotal to the ability to earn food money here and there. Lusty\
  \ voices fell on a sea of sun-kissed shoulders, dreads and beads. Fairy lights reflected\
  \ on the swamp, the glow broken only by shadows of the bat colony skittering across\
  \ a lilac sky above us. I felt home from home, surrounded by people who, too, have\
  \ places to go and nowhere to be. After howling out his own, fast-paced folk, a\
  \ man called Cockatoo Paul interrupted the show. I\u2019d seen him around before\
  \ - an unforgettable acquaintance; pale feather stuck jauntily in his ponytail and\
  \ kangaroo-claw choker he\u2019d fashioned from road-kill. He was looking for anyone\
  \ interested in learning survival skills and escaping Byron\u2019s crowds to go\
  \ with him to his property in remote Kangaroo Creek. A TV production crew would\
  \ soon start filming his new program, and he needed extra hands to get the place\
  \ fit for their arrival. It sounded like a fun weekend for people with the right\
  \ attitudes. Once the show finished, I approached him. At 16, he ran from home and\
  \ began hitching across Australia, armed with a guitar and a few botany books. Now\
  \ 54, his no-nonsense bush survival school is gaining enough recognition to become\
  \ a successful TV series. Over the next few days, during downtime we cooked 'tortillas'\
  \ made from bunya nuts, smashed open and ground with water. We discovered other\
  \ treats on the surrounding trees, such as kangaroo-apples and lillipillis. I slept\
  \ in a swag, was awoken by dingo howls, and one day followed their prints down to\
  \ the creek, where we swam and caked ourselves in mineral rich mud. It would have\
  \ cost $20 a pot in Byron. I bathed outdoors, using soaptree leaves and water heated\
  \ by a fire that I learnt how to light without tools. I learnt which acacias serve\
  \ as antiseptics and how to calculate my latitude and navigate using the stars.\
  \ Alongside new friends and with Paul's help, I connected with nature and the possibility\
  \ of living with my surroundings, rather than just walking around and building atop\
  \ them."
