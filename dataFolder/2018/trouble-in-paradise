Text: "Wi-Fi should probably be banned in paradise.\nAlex and I are on Culebra, objectively\
  \ one of the most beautiful spots on earth. We took a tiny plane from Vieques and\
  \ landed in a tiny airport flanked by rental Jeeps. \nAfter all, Lonely Planet or\
  \ Fodor\u2019s or whoever told me that Playa Flamenco is possibly the best beach\
  \ on earth. \nYou don\u2019t need a passport to go: Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory.\
  \ Alex speaks Spanish. Despite bouts of crippling homesickness, being targeted by\
  \ tropical inconveniences (mosquitos, afternoon downpours, monolingual freeway signs),\
  \ I loved Vieques. It\u2019s where the Mamas and Papas formed. Our rented place\
  \ there had A/C, and a quiet, peaceful view of the Atlantic side at the communal\
  \ swimming pools, where you could get juice and coffee and fruit and yogurt for\
  \ breakfast. \nIn Culebra, nothing seems to go right.  \nWe try snorkeling to find\
  \ tortugas, sea turtles, and my mouthpiece keeps getting inundated by the sea water,\
  \ which induces hyperventilation. I tell Alex to just go ahead without me, but he\
  \ is clearly frustrated. \nThere is a medium-sized group of friends and couples\
  \ from New Jersey, who fit the stereotypes \u2014 tan, sculpted bodies, vowels that\
  \ grate my ears, just a general in-your-face Joysee-ness that runs so counter to\
  \ my nature.\nThey see the damn turtles, though. \nNot seeing the turtles would\
  \ become one of those sore points, something you feel ridiculous for complaining\
  \ about, but that encapsulates some frustration you have in a relationship that\
  \ is entering the Lame Duck phase and is easier and kinder than delving too deep\
  \ into the fundamentals.\nYou\u2019re \u201Cdepressed;\u201D you haven\u2019t undergone\
  \ a change in worldview so fundamental that you aren\u2019t compatible with a man\
  \ you started dating a month after your mom died.\nRight? Right.\nBack to paradise.\n\
  It turns out we need to take a left as soon as you hit the seagrass, not considerably\
  \ further into the ocean. It was choppy because we were too far in. When we go to\
  \ the second beach, I do fine. Manta rays, neon-colored fish, the intricacies of\
  \ the coral reef: I see them all without too much trouble. \nWhen we\u2019re back\
  \ at the cabin, I get on the Wi-Fi.\nI insist we go out, get out of the cabin. We\
  \ eat steak and I\u2019m drinking yet another rum cocktail, numbing my feelings\
  \ listening to terrible Spanish-language karaoke. It\u2019s not the whole world\
  \ I weep for. \nWhen is it ever?\nHundreds of my contemporaries in France are being\
  \ mowed down by machine guns in the Bataclan."
