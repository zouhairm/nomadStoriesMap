Text: "I needed only a one-way ticket out of Philadelphia, that cold and colorless\
  \ graveyard where I had become a stranger. Perhaps it was never truly my home, but\
  \ just a space I occupied until I was used up and deemed disposable.\nIt was dark\
  \ when I first stepped onto the moonlit cobblestone along the Liffey, and although\
  \ I had never set foot here before, the roads felt familiar. Past midnight, the\
  \ pubs were closed, but the late bars teemed with life. Scribed over the door was\
  \ \"c\xE9ad m\xEDle f\xE1ilte\"\u2014\u201Ca hundred thousand welcomes\u201D\u2014\
  words that not only appear at the entrance of every establishment, but that embody\
  \ the Irish way of life.\nOne pint in and already I had heard the life stories of\
  \ my new friends. The next day, I was a regular. Three days later, I was family.\
  \ Expectations here were as foreign as the brogue. The rain curled my hair into\
  \ a wild mane, my Gucci heels proved impossible on the cobblestone, and my friends\
  \ poked fun at my false eyelashes and claw-like nails. I wore the same few t-shirts\
  \ and jeans after that. The local butcher, John, cradled my unpainted face one night\
  \ and explained: \"We don't have much here. We work hard, make just enough to go\
  \ to the pub for drinks after work and have a craic. We go home, sleep, and do it\
  \ again the next day. What more do you need?\" He was right. I had been selling\
  \ myself short. I deserved more; I needed less. My heart began to beat along with\
  \ the bodhr\xE1n.\nIn the boatyards of Cork, on the Cliffs of Moher, at the summit\
  \ of Croagh Patrick, on Wicklow's hills, in every unimaginable shade of green that\
  \ spans coast to coast, I found my value. A wealth of personalities and stories\
  \ resided in these quaint towns of churches and pubs. With all things superfluous\
  \ removed, I learned a person\u2019s genuine value; I dug deep and exposed the heart.\
  \ In a month I never heard one complaint. They didn't have much, but they had everything.\
  \ Laughter, old stories, music: this was their wealth, and I wanted to harvest it.\n\
  I stayed a month and returned a year later. No need to announce my arrival; I knew\
  \ exactly where to find my Irish family, like a shoebox of old relics carefully\
  \ stowed away to be revisited and admired when the heart grows heavy. As I walked\
  \ into Kyteler's that night, Tomas smiled and stopped his set mid-song, saying,\
  \ \"for our American friend, Julia, who's made her way home,\" and sang \"A Song\
  \ for Ireland.\" I had everything I needed; I was content. Surrounded by friends,\
  \ we sang together in warm embraces. And the craic was good."
