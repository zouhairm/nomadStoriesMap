Text: "It's hard to say exactly which decision caused me to find myself clinging to\
  \ a canyon wall in the Quilotoa region of Ecuador, with the only options being to\
  \ climb to the top or tumble down. Our lives are defined by a never-ending chain\
  \ of decisions, so how far down the chain should I go? My decision to come to Ecuador\
  \ in the first place? Or deciding to buy the trekking book whose directions I had\
  \ (unsuccessfully) attempted to follow? If I had to choose one, it would be the\
  \ simple decision that travelers must make throughout their journeys - forge ahead\
  \ or turn around and play it safe. I made that decision as I stood on the edge looking\
  \ down into the canyon, unsure of myself and not entirely certain if this was the\
  \ canyon I was supposed to enter. I should have listened to the voice of doubt in\
  \ my head that was clamoring to be heard, but I decided to take that first step\
  \ to begin the descent from which I consider myself lucky to have made it out unharmed.\
  \ The path fizzled out and soon I was enveloped by thick vegetation. Then I had\
  \ one more decision to make - fight my way back out or escape by climbing which\
  \ seemed to be the best choice at the time. As I think about why I made the decisions\
  \ I made, I realize the best thing I can do is explain why I made them so that others\
  \ won't make the same mistakes.\n \n Looking back on my harrowing experience it's\
  \ easy to see what prompted me to take that first step. Before my trip to Quilotoa,\
  \ my experience in Ecuador had been comfortable and lacking in challenge or adventure.\
  \ I was motivated by pride, by the need to prove to myself or some anonymous \"\
  other\" that I could complete a backpacking journey off the beaten path. As foolish\
  \ as it seems now, I also wanted to justify the $20 I had spent on that trekking\
  \ book which I'd carried around for the sole purpose of taking that short trip.\
  \ \n\n With the ubiquity of social media, the temptation to do things just to prove\
  \ you did them is always strong. Challenge yourself and strive to do something unusual\
  \ and unique, but not at the expense of your safety or for the sake of a few likes.\
  \ Never be afraid to get to the edge. But once you're there think carefully about\
  \ your next move and don't be ashamed if that means turning around. If I have to\
  \ turn back to avoid a dangerous situation in the mountains I always remind myself\
  \ that the mountain will be there tomorrow. The mountain, canyon, or river beyond\
  \ the edge will be there tomorrow - make sure you will be too."
