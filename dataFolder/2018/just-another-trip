Text: 'I used to travel just in my country, I used to say that there is no something
  different to do in other countries. I am from Costa Rica, we have beautiful beaches,
  mountains, waterfalls, jungles... I used to said: if I go abroad all that i would
  do is go to beaches, mountains, waterfalls and jungles. I could do that in my country.
  One day, my parents gift to me a trip to Mexico, exactly to Cancun. I tried to change
  my mind and I started to think that it was an opportunity to know new places or
  that it will be just another exciting trip. I never thought that it will be the
  open door to my new life. I never imagined that my first day in Mexico will change
  completely my way of think. Those days turned into my most grateful experience because
  in those days I started to falling in love with the world, falling in love with
  the differents cultures, with the languages, with the accents, with the people...Mexico
  is a beautiful country with a very long and rich cultural segments which can teach
  you a lot about how to see the new people who you know, how to be thankful to be
  what we are, how to be thankful with the earth, how to be thankful with everything
  around us.'
