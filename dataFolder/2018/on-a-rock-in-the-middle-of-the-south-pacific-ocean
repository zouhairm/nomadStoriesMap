Text: "Niue is 24 hours behind my previous destination, New Zealand. Does this make\
  \ me a time-traveller?\n\nWith only one flight in/out per week, I find myself alone\
  \ on this raised coral rock in the South Pacific Ocean - not my original plan to\
  \ celebrate turning 22. Last night's sleep was the initiation I had hoped for: lizard\
  \ tales scraping against walls; blinding flashes of lightning; and ground-shaking\
  \ claps of thunder. There are approx. 1500 inhabitants, roughly 250km\xB2 of land\
  \ and billions of gallons of ocean battering against this Polynesian rock. This\
  \ seems pretty fun! Or stupid?\n\nOnce the adrenaline had settled down and the temptation\
  \ to explore the nearby sea track (aka. imminent death) had gone, I fall asleep...for\
  \ 3 hours. Greeted by the wailing 7am alarm and the clucks of neighbouring chickens,\
  \ the golden glare provides all the motivation to get out of bed. Paradise! \n\n\
  Niue is so small that every house has a 4-digit phone number, everyone knows everyone\
  \ and you're rarely more than 20 minutes away from anywhere in a car. Morning #1\
  \ and I\u2019ve booked on to the only guided tour of the island - a family-ran business.\
  \ My theory was to discover the highlights of Niue, then rent a bike to spend more\
  \ time in my favourite places! So here I am, unenthusiastically grabbing a handful\
  \ of bran flakes and milk, starting to read Stephen King\u2019s 'Firestarter' while\
  \ waiting to be picked up. I told them where I am staying and they said they'll\
  \ be here at 8am - all confirmed via email.\n\n8.15am. I'm patient, but traffic\
  \ is no issue here. \n\n8.30am. Overslept?\n\n8.45am. Lizards barricading them in?\n\
  \n9am. Bitten by a sea snake?\n\n9.30am. They\u2019ve forgotten me.\n\nAs I turn\
  \ to enter my room, a Land Rover dashes past the end of the drive. I turn back around\
  \ and manage to catch the logo that signed off their email! Goodbye Stephen King.\
  \ I lock the door and scamper to the main road. I see it, 200, 220, now 250 metres\
  \ away. Waving my hands and shouting simultaneously, my flip flop breaks at the\
  \ toe. I limp to a stop and apologise to the onlookers, starring through their window\
  \ - baffled (and amused). Hilarious. Pathetic.\n\n8 hours later\u2026 \n\nI'm googling\
  \ whether 'Firestarter' has been made in to a film yet? Turns out it was the start\
  \ of Drew Barrymore's career! Through the window, I see a land rover pull up on\
  \ the drive. I know that logo. A man steps out and I spring to my feet, meeting\
  \ him out on the balcony - \u201CTom? We are mortified. Let me take you to the east\
  \ side of the island. Get in\u201D."
