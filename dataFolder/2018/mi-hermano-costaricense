Text: "\u201CI want you leave Jason!\" My Costa Rican hostess fired at me in broken\
  \ English. I thought I had been a model guest, so I asked what she meant. \"You\
  \ left dryer on for 3 hours. I will leave for vacation in week. I don't trust you\
  \ anymore.\" \nI was being kicked out of the house I was renting in, because I had\
  \ set the dryer incorrectly. My host and I had gotten along well until I committed\
  \ the mortal sin of misusing the dryer. I apologized and started looking for another\
  \ place. I found a nightly room in a decent looking two-story house close by. I\
  \ moved into the two-story house and scoured town for a long-term place. Everything\
  \ was a little higher than my price range or lower than the safe standard of living\
  \ I needed. \nDejected, I returned to my temp place to learn from Isaac, my new\
  \ Costa Rican host, that I could rent the spacious room I was currently using in\
  \ his house on a monthly basis. This was great; I had a new place to stay that was\
  \ far better than the previous house I stayed in with at least one roommate within\
  \ 20 years of my age.\nIsaac and I\u2019s most significant common trait was that\
  \ both of our fathers had passed away prematurely in sudden accidents. While mine\
  \ died long ago, his passed weeks before I met him. Without me staying at his house,\
  \ he would be grieving for his father alone.Our friendship blossomed into something\
  \ like a brotherhood. Shortly before I returned to the USA, Isaac even took me to\
  \ his family's farm. We arrived to find Isaac's mother had prepared a feast for\
  \ us. After two hours of eating, we drove for 10 minutes before reaching the edge\
  \ of a barely visible walking trail. Isaac cut our way down to a river. We arrived\
  \ at a pristine waterfall with drinkable water flowing over it. It was paradise.\
  \ Previously, I had taken day trips to waterfalls, but none were as remote or as\
  \ inviting as this one. We spent the next 3 hours jumping off various parts of the\
  \ waterfall into the pool at the bottom. It was everything I wanted to do during\
  \ the end of my time in Costa Rica. It would not have been possible without Isaac.\
  \ A short time past and the day came for me to head back to the US for Christmas.\
  \ I was confident that Isaac would make it through the remaining part of the grieving\
  \ process, but still felt a tinge of brotherly responsibility for him.I cannot say\
  \ enough about how my time in Costa Rica was enriched because I stayed at Isaac's\
  \ house. I guess my dryer error was the best thing that could have happened to me\
  \ there."
