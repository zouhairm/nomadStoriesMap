Text: "Everybody is familiar with the expression, be careful what you wish for!  In\
  \ my case that is exactly what had happened on my trip home from a textile show,\
  \ Heimtex, which is in Frankfurt.\nWhen I was booking my flight I was put off by\
  \ the high prices.  It seems there is some type of collusion to raise prices exactly\
  \ on the dates I had to get to the show.\nNot wanting to pay the exorbitant fares\
  \ I decided to take my chances with a new airline called WOW, which is based in\
  \ Iceland. Yes, that\u2019s the name!  I should have known better but decided to\
  \ take a chance and book the flight, which stopped in Reykjavik.\n \nFlying to Germany\
  \ was no problem but the return gave me an unexpected adventure.  Long story short,\
  \ several other weary travelers and I had to stay in Iceland for a night. After\
  \ missing our connecting flights, we were told to pick up our suitcases, proceed\
  \ to the service counter at the Reykjavik airport and were handed a voucher for\
  \ our youth hostel as well as one for meals.  That was a bit alarming! There wasn\u2019\
  t even an opportunity to put up a protest.\n \nIt was evident that none of us were\
  \ going anywhere anytime soon. we all looked at each other, resigned to our fate,\
  \ and decided to make the most of it. Secretly, many of us had wished that we could\
  \ spend at least a little time in this strange and beautiful country.  Now are wishes\
  \ were coming true!\n \nWe immediately split into groups. The young financially\
  \ challenged travelers formed their own group and decided to hang out at the local\
  \ pool hall and down some native brews. Those us of with professions decided to\
  \ rent a car and drive to the Blue Lagoon, which is one of the 25 wonders of the\
  \ world. if we were going to be stuck in Iceland, we were going to see something,\
  \ gosh darn it!\n \nIt turned out to be an amazing experience and EXACTLY what the\
  \ doctor ordered. The Blue Lagoon was just as I had imagined. It was mesmerizing\
  \ at nighttime with the cold air on my head, a sea of stars above and a foggy mist\
  \ floating over the heated water.  It was also funny with people sporting mud masks\
  \ dripping from their faces looking like Mrs. Doubtfire or an outback Aborigine!\n\
  \ \nI met some amazing people who\u2019s motto in life is Carpe Diem. We seized\
  \ the moment and experienced what many people only dream about, albeit against our\
  \ will initially! For those of us stuck in Iceland, we went with the flow and have\
  \ some great memories to show for it! Once in awhile, the universe gives us what\
  \ we secretly wish for and then some!"
