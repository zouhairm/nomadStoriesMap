Text: "I started out of sleep when the train came to a screeching halt. Memories ebbed\
  \ back as I regained senses and recalled my dozing off just as the train departed\
  \ from Nakhon Pathom. I looked out the window and saw the station signboard \u2018\
  Kanchanaburi\u2019. As I quickly reached for my backpack in a shocked panic, the\
  \ train whistled, signalling its departure for the next station.\n\n\u201CNo, wait!\u201D\
  \ I heaved my backpack to the door, despite knowing it was too late. \u201CThat\
  \ was my stop\u2026\u201D\n\n\u201CWhere are you going, my child?\u201D came a papery\
  \ voice. I turned around and saw his friendly face and warm smile. He was bald,\
  \ save a few strands of greyed hair that lightly capped his head.\n\n\u201CErawan\
  \ National Park but I\u2019ve missed the stop,\u201D I sighed.\n\n\u201CAh, don\u2019\
  t you want to explore the Death Railway? You are on the train now\u2026\u201D\n\n\
  The old man walked to the seat across mine and from underneath it, extracted a folded\
  \ map.\n\n\u201CMap of Kanchanaburi,\u201D he said, unfolding it. I went over to\
  \ him. \u201CWe continue towards Namtok at the end of the line,\u201D he explained,\
  \ tracing the map with his index finger. \u201CIt\u2019s about an hour journey to\
  \ Namtok and the last train departs at 2PM so you\u2019re in time to catch the 4PM\
  \ bus to Erawan at Kanchanaburi,\u201D said the old man thoughtfully.\n\n\u201C\
  That sounds great! Thank you so much, mister,\u201D I said.\n\n\u201CYou can call\
  \ me Uncle Preecha.\u201D\n\nHe smiled at me as he kept the map away in his briefcase\
  \ and walked to the window. I joined him and gazed outside. The train was crossing\
  \ the bridge over River Kwai, its crystalline waters shimmering in the mid-morning\
  \ sun, flowing past a Guan Yin statue that stood tall overlooking the river. A little\
  \ further on, the train sharply reduced its speed as it wounded around a rocky cliff\
  \ face at the great bend of River Kwai. It rolled on at snail pace, the railway\
  \ sleepers jutting over the drop to the river below while the raised pillars of\
  \ the tracks shuddered under the weight of the train.\n\n\u201CAt this bend, the\
  \ train must slow down or it risks flying off the tracks or the railway might collapse.\
  \ The Death Railway was built entirely of wood without any fastenings, an ancient\
  \ technique of the Japanese wooden architecture. This means that the wooden blocks\
  \ are held together purely by design. No nails. No glue,\u201D Uncle Preecha narrated.\
  \ \u201CIt is said that each wooden sleeper equalled to one death of the r\u014D\
  musha who built the railway. There are 100 thousand sleepers and so, 100 thousand\
  \ had fallen asleep.\u201D\n\nI stole a look at him and he seemed to be in deep\
  \ reminiscence."
