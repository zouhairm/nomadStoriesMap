Text: "\u201CYour understanding depends on which lens are you wearing at the time\u201D\
  . I instantly remember the words of my former professor as I took my time to let\
  \ the sunset-orange sunrays kindly cherish my skin. It was warm. The kind of warmth\
  \ that opens a reticent yet comforting smile on one\u2019s face.\n\nMy bus continued\
  \ through the unpaved street back to the city and for the first time I felt like\
  \ I was really saying goodbye. A farewell to the picturesque colorful houses placed\
  \ side by side in matching colors, to the small square where people would reunite\
  \ at night to chat, to the women who sold fruits on little huts by the road side\
  \ and greeted me with silent smiles every day. And, specially, a goodbye to Fernanda.\n\
  \nAt first, I used to teach Fe world curiosities \u2013 then math, than science,\
  \ then Portuguese and the list goes on. Her shy outcome and tender eyes seemed to\
  \ be an often and effective way to disguise the eight year-old enthusiasm and curiosity.\
  \ The thrill was evident whenever an unknown fact for Fernanda was thrown into a\
  \ made up story I would tell when we meet in the morning market. \u201CNat, how\
  \ did Abi learn all that?\u201D Fe asked me sincerely, remembering a plot about\
  \ a Singapore girl who came to Brazil. I felt an imaginary sweat drop on my forehead\
  \ as I wonder what retaliation could be chosen for someone who ignites bold questions,\
  \ even if they are as simple as the one Fernanda asked me. I blanked the option\
  \ out of my mind and focused on answering in it the best way I could.\n\n\u201C\
  You see, even though she had many adversities in her way, she never stopped being\
  \ curious\u201D I initiated, trying to look as composed and assure as I could. \u201C\
  She wanted to learn more and more each day and she searched for knowledge, regardless\
  \ of what people would say of her\u201D I completed. Deep down I knew thar trying\
  \ to have empowerment through knowledge in a small village on the countryside was\
  \ an experience that I had only lived for a few weeks, therefore I couldn\u2019\
  t know the magnitude of strength that was required to complete the task. \n\nBut,\
  \ somehow, I knew this girl could defy it.  \n\nOn my way back, I saw Fernanda's\
  \ mother. She smilled at me in a warm way. The kind of warmth that filled my soul,\
  \ as almost as thanking me for my discreet fight. Then I changed the dark shaded\
  \ lens I was seeing through, filled with insecurity, fear and disbelief. Now, they\
  \ sparkled the same sunset-orange that painted my face: optimism, faith and, most\
  \ importantly, renewed energy for more silent battles."
