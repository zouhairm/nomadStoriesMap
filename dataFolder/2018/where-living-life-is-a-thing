Text: "Havana. One word. All your senses. \nSight of colours everywhere. The clothing,\
  \ the cars, the blue of the Atlantic, the green of the palms shading the white sandy\
  \ beaches. And most of all, the art. The art in Cuba is part of the streets. It\
  \ is the story of the people. I don't have money. I would like to buy the Johnny\
  \ Depp as Tonto portrait.\nSmell of history. Of pride, of hardship, of an unbridled\
  \ joy wherever I go. It entices, teases and makes me want to be part of it. Who\
  \ are these people, who live with so little, yet take so much from life?\nTaste.\
  \ Of the most perfect mojitos in the world. Of lobsters, chicken. of saltwater on\
  \ my skin. \nTouch of the sun as I lie wet and content on the hot sand. The warm\
  \ water splashing over my feet.\nSound of music is everywhere. In the street, in\
  \ the cafes, in the restaurants. And we are all dancing. Together. Everyone in the\
  \ square. Everyone everywhere in Havana.\nThere's not enough food. But the Cubans\
  \ give you the food from their own plate. There's not enough internet. Thank goodness.\
  \ \nThere is so much laughter, movement, children playing, everyone dancing.\nI\
  \ don't want to leave."
