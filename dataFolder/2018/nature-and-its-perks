Text: "I was shivering as I held my hot chocolate close . The air around my body seamed\
  \ to be around twenty negative celsius degrees. I felt as if I were about to freeze\
  \ alive . I could not  feel my bones. Not feeling my body was almost as a  if I\
  \ were part of something bigger , part of nature I believe . Yet, I could not move\
  \ a single muscle to get back inside. Instead I stood there, amazed by the unique\
  \ set of colors that painted the night sky . Aurora borealis .\nWhat a moment of\
  \ pure magic ! Snow flakes started falling as I smiled at the Universe, grateful\
  \ for every single thing it has given me throughout the years . Snow melted as it\
  \ came to contact with my skin. My heart seamed to melt as well as the feeling of\
  \ pure happiness was way too strong to control. \nHave you ever experienced a feeling\
  \ so strong and beautiful that other than smile and want to jump out of happiness\
  \ , you did not know what to do ?  A moment where all seems bright and in tune with\
  \ who you are , the person you feel you are supposed to be and existence itself\
  \ ? \nMoments of pure joy and awareness like this made me wonder if there wasn\u2019\
  t a bigger purpose to human existence .\nI had always tried to answer that question\
  \ but it seems that in my nineteen years of existence on Earth , no answer seemed\
  \ yet quite plausible .\n\u201C Oh dear , it\u2019s freezing in here , why don\u2019\
  t you come inside?\u201D \nAs I turned around to face the sweet preoccupied voice\
  \ talking to me the most unexpected thing happened . \nA group of deer came running\
  \ graciously toward me. I thought I was about to have my last breath seeing as they\
  \ were rapidly running but instead, the beautiful and gracious deer stopped as they\
  \ came to a stop right infant of me . Both me and the lady I had been talking to\
  \ started laughing , a mixture of stress and gratefulness in our laughs . That was\
  \ when I looked back and saw her for the first time . She was around twenty years\
  \ old , as me, I believed . Only she seemed much more confident about herself and\
  \ there was something about her that ringed close to pure magic when she smiled.\n\
  \u201C Hello dear, hum and deer I guess\u201D she said and laughed , a little embarrassed\
  \ but purely happy , just like innocent children laugh. It was probably what I loved\
  \ instantly the most about her and also made me feel like if I could honestly trust\
  \ her , because she felt pure and inspired trust , just by the way she smiled and\
  \ laughed . \u201CHow beautiful and inspiring\u201D , I thought."
