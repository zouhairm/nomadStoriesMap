Text: "Driving along the wending uphill roads into Yosemite National Park on a sunny\
  \ April afternoon, we scoffed at road signs that warned us to carry winter tire\
  \ chains. After three hours of highway from LA we were excited to finally see many\
  \ of the shades of green our guide book had promised. With each twist the view became\
  \ more breath taking, now just a few miles out from Upper Pines campground and a\
  \ pitch booked for us and our Jucy campervan. \nAll the advice we had received suggested\
  \ using the National Parks Service website and this served us well, with easy reservation\
  \ and payment options plus tonnes of helpful information such as detailed site maps.\n\
  Suddenly our view was eclipsed by icy clear water tumbling down a cliff side, and\
  \ we found ourselves introduced to the first great falls of our California road\
  \ trip, Bridalveil Fall. Our steady chatter silenced as the awe of the scene took\
  \ hold. \n\nA quick check of the map informed us that we would be able to return\
  \ to this marvel using the free intra-park shuttlebus service. As we motored through\
  \ the blossoming tree tunnels, I couldn\u2019t help but feel overwhelmed that we\
  \ would get to sleep right in the middle of this Eden. \nWe found our pitch with\
  \ ease (American customer care!). Tall firs lined the edge of the campground standing\
  \ in front of colossal mountains. As we unloaded, dusk drew in and we cooked a hasty\
  \ dinner. A crackling fire pit caught our attention and its stokers invited us over\
  \ to share a beer. Snuggled under fleece wraps we swapped stories about our respective\
  \ lives in the UK and US. \n\nWe slept soundly, the gentle patter of rain on the\
  \ car hypnotic. We awoke as the early dawn rays streamed into the van and a chill\
  \ in the air turned our breath into steam. Somehow the arrival of dawn always coincided\
  \ with a full and persistent bladder forcing us to get up.\n\nStepping out of the\
  \ van, I gasped. Instead of a sunrise, I was greeted with a blanket of snow. A good\
  \ few inches as far as the eye could see. The images of the snow chain road signs\
  \ flashed through my mind.\n\nBy the time we\u2019d had our first cuppa, the snow\
  \ was beginning to melt. As we walked to the shuttle, we could see the ploughs had\
  \ cleared the roads. This wasn\u2019t like snow back home, which often ground the\
  \ UK to a halt. Instead it was a thing of beauty, and renewed life and power to\
  \ the waterfalls we had the joy of visiting. \n\nThe next morning, as we started\
  \ our long drive to the next destination, there was barely a sign that the snow\
  \ had fallen."
