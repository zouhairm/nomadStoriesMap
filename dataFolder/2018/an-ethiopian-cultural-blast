Text: "\"Addis!\" \"Bahir Dar!\" The cries echo around the chaotic bus terminal. The\
  \ darkness hides the dirt-tinge of my well-travelled clothes. My backpack shouts\
  \ 'foreigner'. \"Ah, Lalibella\" I stagger, as I recall my intended destination\
  \ at this primitive hour. \n\nI am gestured past the goats huddled together. Past\
  \ the caged chickens struggling to be heard over the quarrel of the street vendors.\
  \ Past the top-heavy van loaded with market goods. I arrive at a disheveled minibus,\
  \ the roof caving in. We await complete discomfort until officially declared full.\
  \ I still haven't given up hope of sleeping. Resting my head in my hands, I close\
  \ my eyes.  \n\nWith the first click of the engine comes the first ear-piercingly\
  \ loud scream. The sudden insult to my ears jolts me awake. The rusty speakers of\
  \ the run-down van are responsible for the untimely blast. My eyes are heavy but\
  \ the high-pitched melody screeches higher than my tolerance. Frustration building\
  \ up inside, I look around. No one raises an eyebrow. \n\nI resort to a silent protest\
  \ as I am thrown around with the bends in the road. Left, right, my head hitting\
  \ the low ceiling as we round sharp corners, navigating potholes. I am now thankful\
  \ for the darkness and its ability to hide the spiraling trail ahead. \n\nThe next\
  \ bend brings with it a second blast of broken song filling the van. Louder than\
  \ can be tolerated by the poor-quality portable radio. A failed attempt at drowning\
  \ out the van's deafening speakers. My ears burn. My mind tries to analyse the situation\
  \ but the crackles take over my thoughts. My ears are hurting. The sun has not yet\
  \ declared a new day. \n\nMy tiredness leads me down a destructive path of frustration,\
  \ annoyance and anger. My western culture largely behind my intolerance. My emotions\
  \ are hidden from the world but raging inside. I regret my choices, I feel alone.\
  \ \n\nA tap on my shoulder breaks my thoughts. I turn to face him. His thick lips\
  \ and yellowed teeth forming an excited grin. His bright eyes shine from a wrinkled\
  \ face with a proudness that pierces my bitter mood. He gestures my gaze toward\
  \ the object in his hand. \"Forengi! Forengi!\" he exclaims innocently pointing\
  \ between myself and the 'made in China' sticker on the back of the old one-speaker\
  \ radio. His finger reaches for the dial. \n\nIn this moment, as a third blast of\
  \ crackled melody fills my head, I give in to the contagion of his welcoming smile.\
  \ \n\nThe sun rises over the Ethiopian mountains to a smiling 'forengi' and a proud\
  \ Ethiopian man."
