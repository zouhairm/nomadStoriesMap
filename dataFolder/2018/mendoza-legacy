Text: "On arriving in mendoza the first thing I had to do was renew my tourist visa.\
  \ After some searching and having a weak knowledge of Spanish I found the visa office\
  \ in a back Street way off the centre of the fabulous city that is mendoza.  Having\
  \ arrived at the visa office I set about renewing my tourist visa, as I had been\
  \ living in Argentina for six months I was worried  if there would be a problem\
  \ of adding another three months to my visa??? After the usual bureaucracy that\
  \ was more like akin to India (but that's another story)  the nice lady at the desk\
  \ informed me it was impossible to renew my visa as I had already added three months\
  \ to my visa in Tucuman nightmare. All I can say is thank you Internet....\n\nSo\
  \ my next task was how I could cross the border in to Chile which lucky for me was\
  \ only a bus journey away. So I set about finding my escape route to Chile. First\
  \ stop I found a travel shop advertising around trips to Santiago de Chile. Have\
  \ seen a minimum size shop I proceeded inside. There was a lady behind the desk\
  \ as I approached here maybe having a desperate look in my eye I proceeded to ask\
  \ her in my spangenglish how I went about getting across the border. I took me a\
  \ bit of time for it to sink in that this beeping the month of August that the road\
  \ had been closed due to a high level of snowfall on the high border pass near puerto\
  \ de inca, with only days remaining of my past tourist visa I was starting to worry.\n\
  \nAfter a restless night of worry I took myself down to mendoza bus station to buy\
  \ a ticket to Santiago. I found a small company running medium mini bus to santatigo\
  \ which I thought which would be faster than a big fifty three seater bus. Having\
  \ acquired a ticket I thought it was time to relax and explore mendoza city with\
  \ great interest, remembering I had only four days left on my visa in the back of\
  \ my mind. \n\nHaving been stressed out over the last two day I was in need of a\
  \ swim and some relaxation so I set about finding mendoza famous spa which was close\
  \ by my hotel. As I entered the plush surroundings I was looking forward to a good\
  \ soak and steam to unwind from my worrying days ahead. I asked the kind gentleman\
  \ if a could use there facilities for an hour or so. He asked me if I was a member\
  \ in which I was not so he handed me a form to fill out plus it said I would have\
  \ to get an hiv test and also get a clear bill of health from a doctor as only having\
  \ three days left on my visa I decided against that............to be continued"
