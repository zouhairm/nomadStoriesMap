Text: "She was fearless. He roamed impatiently. A pickup truck arrived with several\
  \ sweaty men on the back of the cargo anxious on completing their duties. She stood\
  \ up immediately and made her way towards the aroma of ambrosia. Raw and red, the\
  \ meat flew towards a tree and they both found their fix. \n\nIn serious need of\
  \ air, I rolled the window down slightly. The refreshing breeze of Harare gently\
  \ traced my face. \n\nThe route to the Lion and Cheetah park was a warm welcome\
  \ of long highways and colourful locals. Road dust formed at the feet of the many\
  \ families returning from Sunday church. Grandfathers in suits and brown fedoras\
  \ whilst their flamboyant wives walked in trios chatting away the heat with brochure\
  \ bent fans. You could feel the joy in their march home. \n\nThe alpha lioness now\
  \ nourished began walking into a pathway. Her walk was art. Soft and slender yet\
  \ robust and nimble. Her posture never feeble as we drove by her side. She appeared\
  \ naturally apathetic to the 3 vehicles of tourists in her territory. \n\nThis was\
  \ not your typical park. You were free to come in with your vehicle and explore.\
  \ My Zimbabwean companion filled my head with riveting tales of their common behaviours.\
  \ I was curious about the lack of males in the area and he jokingly shared, \u201C\
  There can only be one thorn amongst all the roses\u201D.\n\nI chuckled and a sudden\
  \ booming roar grabbed our attention from the other side of the heavily grilled\
  \ jungle. Their voices echoed and had a low hum that filled the air. There I was,\
  \ witnessing lions greeting each other with passionate roars. I dropped my phone\
  \ instantly and an unanticipated sequence began unravelling itself. \n\nThe roars\
  \ faded and each wild feline returned to a familiar spot for shade. The alpha lion\
  \ chose to quench his thirst by a crystal-clear lake and his queen made her way\
  \ towards him. Midway in her regal steps, she turned around. My heart was pounding\
  \ loud and I could not take my sight off her. It was a mix of excitement and fear,\
  \ as she moved towards my direction instead. \n\nShe stood right in front of my\
  \ window and stared directly at me. Our gaze met for the first time. Everything\
  \ else felt nonexistent. Moments passed and she finally decided to rest beside my\
  \ door. I slumped back into my seat and released a sigh of relief.\n\nThe journey\
  \ back had us both in a quiet and reflective mood with hypnotic hues of orange and\
  \ red filling the skies ahead. I realized only then that I was looking for courage.\
  \ Who knew I would find it in her eyes."
