Text: "The last thing I expected as we bumped and bobbled around that bend, '91 Fiat\
  \ Panda flirting wildly with the precipice, was not the view. When winding your\
  \ way through mountains at any altitude you come to expect a picturesque pot of\
  \ gold of some variety; at the very least a coin sack. This particular road, if\
  \ you could even call it that, etched in a Montenegrin mountainside was no exception.\
  \ We rounded the bend, of which was not unlike any of the other bends we had survived\
  \ the three hours previous, in that there was a certain finality about it. We had\
  \ long given up covering eyes or bracing for bumps and decided that if this is how\
  \ we were going to go\u2014in an off-beige, two-decade-old tin box, piloted by Hagrid's\
  \ slightly more handsome Bosnian nephew, Harold, who had somehow made his way from\
  \ the realm of fiction to Southeastern Europe and along the way developed an unwavering,\
  \ though fitting, fondness for a dance remix of Celine Dion's 'My Heart Will Go\
  \ On'\u2014then we were going to enjoy every single bump and bobble en route to\
  \ that inevitable freefall to our fiery end.\n\nSo there we were, as validated by\
  \ Celine who sang: \"YOU'RE HERE!\", seconds from our demise, when Harold decided\
  \ it as good a time as any for a pit stop. He planted his foot firmly on the left\
  \ pedal. The way we skipped and skidded you would have been forgiven for suspecting\
  \ he had also reefed the handbrake off. Perched up in the backseat, the three of\
  \ us looked up and down, to our left and to our right, and began pawing ourselves\
  \ as if to confirm our continuing existence. The better part of a minute snailed\
  \ by before the dust settled around us to reveal the postcard view that postcards\
  \ send home from their travels. Soaring peaks dressed in stone and shrubbery patchwork\
  \ stretched further than the eye might usually see, but for the purity of the air,\
  \ and further still. At their feet, the deep blues and greens of a bay harboured\
  \ by limestone.  \n\nWe unfolded from the right of the car to see Harold standing\
  \ atop a cow-sized rock-turn-podium. \"Eh?\" He said, gesturing with his head towards\
  \ the sweeping landscape that lived over his shoulder. We stood arm over shoulder\
  \ and watched as that great big speck of the Earth inhaled and exhaled and inhaled.\
  \ Harold wore the gaze of a man who had seen it all before but nothing at all. He\
  \ smiled widely and freely with a glint in his eye that suggested he knew what it\
  \ meant to be and why. It was the last thing I expected but for just that breath\
  \ I knew too."
