Text: "Before I was Charlie, I was Charlotte. And before I was Charlotte, I was Charlie.\
  \ The story goes like this: a poorly read ultrasound told my parents they would\
  \ have a son. Alan Charles, Baby Charlie for short. One babygirl later, they had\
  \ their Baby Charlie in a Charlotte. Charlie I remained until age 5 when I declared\
  \ that I would be a Charlotte; a child\u2019s choice I would come to regret. Charlie\
  \ became the name I almost had. A person I frequently wished I had the courage to\
  \ be. It would take me a lot to get back to Charlie. 500 miles, to be exact, of\
  \ hiking across Northern Spain on the Camino de Santiago. \n\nI hoisted my backpack\
  \ up onto a rickety bed in my first alburgue, the public hostels for pilgrims. A\
  \ few girls came into my room, and we smiled knowingly at each other. What we thought\
  \ we knew, I honestly couldn\u2019t tell you. But we didn\u2019t need to know, and\
  \ maybe that was it. One of the girls, Amber from England, asked me my name. I hesitated,\
  \ as I often did with introductions, daring myself to say my former name. \u201C\
  Charlotte,\u201D I said. Chicken. The other girl, Isabel from Madrid, laughed and\
  \ said this name was too hard for her to pronounce. Was there another name that\
  \ she could call me? \u201COh,\u201D I murmured. I paused, then responded, \u201C\
  People used to call me Charlie as a kid. \u201CYes,\u201D she replied in her thick\
  \ Spanish accent. \u201CThis is better. We call her Charlie.\u201D \n\nThey say\
  \ mysterious, fateful things happen on the Camino. You meet someone and have a conversation\
  \ that you can\u2019t get out of your head as you walk. The next thing you know,\
  \ the conversation has changed your entire view of the world and all with the awareness\
  \ that, had you walked a little further that day, you may never have met that person\
  \ at all. I can think of 3 occasions when I apprehensively introduced myself to\
  \ someone as Charlie, as if I wasn\u2019t sure that they would believe me. They\
  \ all responded, \u201CThat name is perfect for you.\u201D It\u2019s hard not to\
  \ believe in signs after something like that. \n\nAfter 33 of the hardest and most\
  \ rewarding days of my life, it was happening. Walking along the Santiago streets\
  \ towards the plaza, I could feel the previous version of myself there. A Charlotte\
  \ - who secretly wished to be a Charlie - realizing a dream. And there I was, a\
  \ Charlie, fulfilling it. The Camino brought me a lot. Lasting friendships, tough\
  \ lessons, humility, and gratitude. But most importantly, it changed a part of me\
  \ that I could never have done on my own. It made me the Charlie that I need to\
  \ be."
