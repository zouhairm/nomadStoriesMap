Text: "Though its poetry stands intact, and Victor Hugo\u2019s beautiful laments transcend\
  \ time itself, Paris left me broken-hearted.\n\nThe genesis of my love affair with\
  \ Paris; A lifetime\u2019s desire to walk the roads of Esmeralda, and to face Quasimodo\u2019\
  s demons. It was all there, a perfect, timeless setting. With a map in hand, and\
  \ with no fear for embarrassment nor condescension, I made my way through Montparnasse.\
  \ The coordinates did not fail me, but my internal vocation for geography had long\
  \ abandoned me. Distressed and confused, a glimpse of hope appeared to be crossing\
  \ the street in front of me, a woman. I approached with all care and attention,\
  \ and folding my map away I was interrupted by her harsh and hasty, \u201CPas du\
  \ tout! Pas du tout! Je n\u2019sais Pas, pas du tout!\u201D Robbed of my protagonism,\
  \ I felt betrayed by my apparent senseless approach. Was I a bother to this woman?\
  \ All I wanted was an indication, or at least, and hopefully, a confirmation of\
  \ direction. \n\nThus began my epiphany.\n\nThe next day, I met a woman. She was\
  \ lost, and she came to me for direction. It was a busy square, or perhaps a busy\
  \ day, or both. I don't remember much of her, the memory never crystallized. I do\
  \ remember her exasperation, the resemblance in our hair, and the imminent displacement\
  \ of her pace. She asked if I could help her, and she spoke French.\n\n\"Moi aussi,\
  \ je n'suis pas d'ici.\", she exclaimed. Oh, I realized, everyone who's not from\
  \ Paris is a tourist.\n\nVictor Hugo's words will put you at ease, fool you and\
  \ proclaim you an expert wanderer of Parisian blocs, but be not mistaken. This is\
  \ no Dostoevsky's St. Petersburg. In Paris, the barrier is deeper than some literary\
  \ expression, it leaves you feeling altogether inadequate, and perpetually apologetic\
  \ for the nuisance caused by the tourist, the other.\n\nSo at the end of the day,\
  \ what is it that makes us love Paris? We become moved by our passion, despite our\
  \ disappointments in the city. We learn to love its shadows, to value its silence,\
  \ and to find the beauty in the city's most remote corners. I love Paris like I\
  \ love humans: it's full of flaws. It exemplifies human frailty, it speaks of human\
  \ fluidity. Parisians are not rude, they are tired of flooding tourists who pay\
  \ no respect to the normal order of things. \n\nAnd sometimes, us, tourists, forget\
  \ that."
