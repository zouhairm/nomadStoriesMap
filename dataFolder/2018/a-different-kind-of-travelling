Text: "You find the edge in strange places. Sometimes you have to travel thousands\
  \ of miles to stand at the edge of the world and feel yourself just existing, small\
  \ and fragile. Sometimes you feel the edges of your world digging into your shoulders\
  \ as you push against them, desperately straining to break free. And when you find\
  \ the edge, what then? Do you think better of it and back away, retreating to something\
  \ familiar and safe? Or do you peer over the cliff, stare at the horizon of the\
  \ unknown, and jump?\n\nI\u2019d done everything right \u2013 gone to a good university\
  \ and got a good degree, then graduated and got a good job. I was sensibly saving\
  \ money for a house and ticking all the boxes. But the edges of the world I was\
  \ building were leaning in on me more every day. \n\nSo, I jumped. I quit my job\
  \ and booked a flight. I felt my edges rushing away from me as I packed my life\
  \ into one bag and said goodbye to my friends. But then, with unwelcome ironic timing,\
  \ they came straight back for me, boxing me back in with doctors\u2019 appointments\
  \ and bills to pay. \n\nWith my globetrotting plans derailed I was faced with a\
  \ different kind of edge; an edge where there was nothing on the other side. I turned\
  \ to a different kind of travelling and dropped my exotic ideals, repacking my bag\
  \ with warmer clothes better suited to the British climate.\n\nA canal boat might\
  \ not seem like it fits with the jet-setting lifestyle modern travelling celebrates.\
  \ Moving at a top speed of 4mph, you\u2019re forced to detach from the constant\
  \ stream of intense immediacy which our hyper-connected world creates. But to my\
  \ surprise, the slow living enforced by boating truly taught me the old adage that\
  \ life is a journey, not a destination.\n\nThe tiny oasis of off-grid living, which\
  \ might stretch as far as the banks in a city centre canal or as far as you can\
  \ see in the open countryside, redefines your edges without meaning to. Waking and\
  \ sleeping with the sun and leading a completely calm existence (occasionally becoming\
  \ manic as two boats with lots of momentum and no brakes meet on a corner and slowly\
  \ and inevitably become part of the most underwhelming traffic collision conceivable)\
  \ erased my edges. \n\nBut once you\u2019ve jumped you can\u2019t ignore the call\
  \ to keep doing it. When you\u2019ve been pushed to the edge and kept going you\
  \ can\u2019t turn back. Whether it\u2019s on a quiet canal in rural England, or\
  \ thousands of miles away from home, I will jump again."
