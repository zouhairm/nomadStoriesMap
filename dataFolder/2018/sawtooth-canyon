Text: "Barstow is a small desert town located about 2 hours northeast of LA.  Nobody\
  \ considers it a destination town. At the same time, nobody expects much of the\
  \ California desert.  The only town that can really boast a respectable tourism\
  \ industry is Palm Springs, with its old wealth and manicured vista.  It has become\
  \ the escape of those wishing to throw a trendy party or have a romantic weekend\
  \ away in the Winter.  Joshua Tree national park lies to the southeast from Barstow.\
  \  The oft photographed boulder haven has had prominence in almost every trendy\
  \ fashion catalog or magazine from JCrew to Rolling Stone.  It is in fact well deserved,\
  \ though overplayed.\n But Barstow, no travel tails recount of the lurings of this\
  \ midway desert town.  Its story is hinted at towards an abandoned waterslide park\
  \ that lies 15 minutes beyond town up the highway, littered with dead palm trees\
  \ and empty pools that compliment the graffitied, abandoned concession stands.\n\
  \ But as in all things nature, the failure of this desert town to give the attractive\
  \ call, is not organic unto itself, and probably lies in the fault of man.  The\
  \ proof - Sawtooth Canyon.  A boulder-lined little valley, sitting high above the\
  \ surrounding desert.  It seems as much out of place as a biodom that produces fruit\
  \ and flowers on a martian land.  Unseen from the highway, and little known despite\
  \ the web, what town may represent of man, Sawtooth represents the undeniable aesthetic\
  \ allure of the pure open.  It is the last thing you would expect to find in a desert\
  \ that most people see as a transition space between Vegas and the beach.\n Similar\
  \ to the well known surroundings in Joshua Tree, Sawtooth Canyon is surrounded my\
  \ modest peaks that are layden with boulders - perfect for climbing, bouldering,\
  \ and are gentle enough for any would be adventurer. \n Atop these modest boulder\
  \ peaks, views are unobstructed for miles - maybe even hundreds of miles.  Something\
  \ alien to any Southern California metropolite.  The wind blows gently as well atop\
  \ the boulder mountains.  Enough to cool your body temperature and wonder at nature\u2019\
  s ability to provide just enough hospitality for those seeking to stay a while.\
  \  \n Me, I am a weekend camper who keeps a bowie knife in his car because it is\
  \ the only way that I feel attached to nature or a rouged life.  Mor me, Sawtooth\
  \ is the last thing, and yet the best thing, that you would expect to find on a\
  \ stretch of forgotten desert."
