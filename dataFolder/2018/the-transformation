Text: "My most beautiful moments were born while I travelled.  This is the oldest\
  \ of such a moment.\n         It was the year 1983.  I had been working in a bank\
  \ and got transferred to a remote village.  To reach my office, I had to take two\
  \ buses.  Getting there on time became a never-ending struggle. With a three month-year-old\
  \ child to breastfeed, travelling for hours and reaching home late at night had\
  \ been traumatic. \n         One day the bus left before I reached the station.\
  \  Feeling disheartened, I decided to go back. Suddenly, the name of the village\
  \ where I am headed to echoed incessantly in the air.\n   \u2018Does this bus go\
  \ straight to Karuvarakundu? \u2018I asked the \u2018cleaner\u2019 of the bus who\
  \ was calling out the name.  He is the person who has to keep standing on the footboard\
  \ of the bus throughout its schedule and invite people to get on the bus. \n   \
  \   \u2018Yes, but it takes more time\u2019, he said.  I couldn\u2019t believe him.\
  \  Ignoring his words, I got in and sat near the door. I should not say \u2018door\u2019\
  ; in those days, private buses had only entrances and no doors.   \n      After\
  \ running through our town, the bus took a deep turn and entered a narrow road.\
  \ It began to stop at every step that it seemed the bus had almost stopped running.\
  \ People carrying baskets loaded with vegetables or fruits or eggs eagerly got in\
  \ and placed them on the floor of the bus. The bus is no more a bus, I thought.\
  \ The journey itself had turned into a festival.\n     The bus continued its journey\
  \ at its whim. There was no hurry either for the bus or for the passengers. I was\
  \ the only one suffering and I was the only one looking at the watch.   \n     The\
  \ cleaner who was closely watching me remarked\u2019 I told, you the bus won\u2019\
  t reach in time, did I?\u2019\n     I wondered why time should keep the exact time.\n\
  \      Sometimes the bus acted as if it was drunk. I really had an impulse to get\
  \ down and run away to some far away land.  I was at that moment that a river appeared\
  \ in front of the bus. Yes, a river and no bridge.  I felt I would burst out of\
  \ anxiety.  \n     What I saw next made me love the whole world. The bus stepped\
  \ into the river.  It ran like a school kid splashing water all along.   The craziest\
  \ and the most unpunctual bus I had ever come across, crossing a river!  I forgot\
  \ myself. I forgot my office. Time stood still for me. Only the river mattered:\
  \ only the bus mattered: only the moment mattered."
