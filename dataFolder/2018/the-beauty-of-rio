Text: "In 2013 I went to Rio de Janeiro, to work as a volunteer in the World Youth\
  \ Day, which is the main event to the catholic youth, because it reunites people\
  \ from all over the world to see the Pope.\nWork as a volunteer was an awesome experience,\
  \ because you are able to share and learn a lot of things about life and culture\
  \ of many places of the country and the world and also is a good way to travel and\
  \ not spend lots of money.\nIn a trip like that, you need to  be prepare to lower\
  \ your expectations about food and accommodation, most of the pilgrims and volunteers\
  \ are hosted in schools and churches, what means simple food, sleeping on the floor\
  \ and the worst of all: cold shower. Bu above all those thing, people who are enjoying\
  \ the event, keep an spirit of help, kindness and charity, they can also be happy\
  \ passing through the most hard moments.\nRio de Janeiro is a famous city all over\
  \ the world by its beauties: wonderful beaches, the carnival, so as by the violence\
  \ issues and drug trade.\nKnowing and imagining all those things, I prepare myself\
  \ to be aware all the time, to not put myself in dangerous situations and come home\
  \ safe as I went. It was a great pleasure to meet Rio\u2019s citizens, and watch\
  \ how they are p to help all  the people that arrived, giving right information\
  \ and advices, helping us with the way to go, places to visit or eat, hoe to be\
  \ safe, or even to have a good talk in the subway or in the bus.\nThe people of\
  \ Rio revealed a very gentle an honest spirit. It is curious to see how that great\
  \ spirit relays on the most simple things.\nAfter a week of simple accommodation\
  \ and cold shower, a family who leave near by the church I  was staying, offered\
  \ their house and their amazing hot shower to the volunteers to use it, so I have\
  \ a chance to (in addition to take a hot shower)to became part of their family.\
  \ It supposed to be only a shower but became so much more! The owners of the house\
  \ started to care about us, as their own children; caring about our safety and feeding,\
  \ they were also curious about every single personal story, bringing up an amazing\
  \ exchange of experiences.\nPassing through all of this thing, I can certainly say\
  \ that the most important beauty of Rio de Janeiro, wasn\u2019t the Copacabana beach,\
  \ or the Christ Redeemer Statue, not even the Ipanema Sunset, it was the people."
