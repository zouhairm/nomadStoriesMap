Text: "He introduced himself by his \u2018Western\u2019 name, Sam. \u201CHave you\
  \ been to see the local temples and mountain yet?\u201D he asked, referring to Mudeungsan\
  \ Mountain National Park. I welcomed a chance to get to know the city through a\
  \ local. \n\nI was in Gwangju; South Korea's sixth-largest city. My friends were\
  \ intrigued when I revealed the mysterious land I would visit: confused it with\
  \ its Northern neighbour; questioning if I was even allowed to enter the country.\
  \ I was curious about how I would be treated, as a lone, British Asian female, wandering\
  \ this south-west corner. \n\nClearly I was too much for the locals when I arrived\
  \ at my stop on the modern metro system that cut across the city. Some elderly matriarchs\
  \ jostled me into the lift with them, to be engulfed in a kind of group hug from\
  \ overbearing, lovable aunties. It was a shame we were lost in translation; I was\
  \ touched by their misplaced but kind-hearted intentions and could see they wanted\
  \ to know more. Surely they were saying, \u201CBoy, she must be really lost, what\
  \ is she doing in Gwangju?\u201D They insisted on showing me where the clearly signposted\
  \ exit was, convinced I would be unable to find it alone. \n\nI\u2019d tested out\
  \ my flexibility and metal chopstick skills at a traditional sit-down meal. I also\
  \ got a taste of \u2018Gwangju style\u2019 at a craft beer pub \u2013 the current\
  \ trend among the millennial Koreans that love their fads. I thought our international\
  \ party blended in until I realised we were the tourist attraction as locals walked\
  \ past to take photos of their hipster bar inhabited by Westerners.\n\nSam took\
  \ me to the mountain viewpoint, which offered that classic cityscape vista. He asked\
  \ about what London was like. To him, it seemed almost unreal, virtually mythical.\
  \ His expression was withdrawn and serious, as he opened up about relatable pressures:\
  \ \u201CI have a good job but all I do is work. I live by myself and that\u2019\
  s it, I\u2019m actually quite lonely. My mother keeps asking when I\u2019ll get\
  \ married.\u201D \n\nHe diplomatically skirted around my probing of his views on\
  \ the North, conscious even here, on an isolated mountain, far from the border.\
  \ After discussing a rumour of how Russian President Putin\u2019s daughter had dated\
  \ and come close to marrying a Korean, we wandered down to Jeungsimsa Temple, which\
  \ has undergone numerous restorations in its long history. Twice destroyed by fire\
  \ in war, the temple itself was beautifully simple, modest and elegant. It didn\u2019\
  t shout or brag about its long history or resilience; it didn\u2019t need to."
