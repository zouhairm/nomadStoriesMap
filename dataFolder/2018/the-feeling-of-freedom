Text: "I still remember the moment, the exact moment when eveyrthing changed. When\
  \ I understood that this was the life I wanted to live. It was a kind of epiphany.\
  \ It is so clear in my mind that if I close my eyes I can still feel the weight\
  \ of my backpack on my shoulders, the noise of the train coughing, the taste of\
  \ that fast cigarette smoked nervously.I was alone, for the first time completely\
  \ alone, free to make my own decions. \u201CIs this loneliness or freedom?\u201D\
  \ This was my thought before leaving, but after the first ten minutes of my trip\
  \ I already had my answer. I was free. Free. I remember repeating this word on my\
  \ mind like a mantra, tasting every letter. F R E E. I was nineteen, with a poor\
  \ english, Iggy Pop and \u201Cpassenger\u201D on my headphones and a backpack full\
  \ of dreams, alone in a train to go somewhere, with no certain destination. First\
  \ stop Wien, the rest of the trip still to plan. The first magical meeting was with\
  \ a norwegian guy, Finn, that caught my attention. He was sitting on a side of the\
  \ street with an old guitar and three dogs, singing Bob Dylan with a passion that\
  \ would make jealous even the real Bob. He was so.. in peace in that moment. I was\
  \ so hypnotized to not realize he finished to sing and all the people around me\
  \ were desappearing. He looked at me smiling, asking something like \u201Cdo you\
  \ like Bob?\u201D, I remember to suddendly wake up, like after a strange dream and\
  \ answering confusedly. We started talking, about his choice of life, about how\
  \ how everything was different now, about how he was feeling free. Again this word,\
  \ again this feeling. Is freedom what everything is about? Never in my life I thought\
  \ about that like during that trip. And then, suddenly, like a flash, an idea in\
  \ my mind.\n\u201CCan I write about you?\u201D I asked. He looked at me, like if\
  \ this was the most normal question ever.\n\u201CStories of Freedom\u201D, this\
  \ is the name of the wonderful collection of lifes I made at the end of this illuminating\
  \ trip. I wrote about Alberto, an italian guy that was saving money to sail the\
  \ ocean alone, about Daria, a german woman that sold her company to give all the\
  \ money to charity and living travelling the world or about Juliana and Sebastian,\
  \ a young colombian couple that is travelling with their little kid Mateo in a van.\
  \ Jumping in that train it\u2019s been the best unconscious and reckless decision\
  \ I have ever made, the best feeling I have ever felt, and since that day I decided\
  \ I never want to stop to feel like this."
