Text: "We had only been here a few hours, in between flights. Did my mom have the\
  \ same inner journey as I did on my first visit?\nYears ago, I did not expect much\
  \ or better said I had not heard much of Beograd. Have you? Astonished\u2026Just\
  \ not what you\u2019d expect, but then again, what to expect when so little has\
  \ been said? The snow and late night lights gave it a charm, but that wasn\u2019\
  t it. It was the complex architecture, impossible to overlook. Ah, must be the city\
  \ center! I thought. But there it was everywhere. \u201CEnough! Show me the bad,\
  \ the poor, the ugly. I want to see it all!\u201D. Puzzled, \u201CI don\u2019t know\
  \ what you mean\u201C my friend said. Crowded streets, alive on weekdays. There\
  \ artwork on the sidewalk, here a loud band of musicians with cymbals, further youngsters\
  \ performing on their violins. I caved \u2026 that must have been it. Dazzled. Where\
  \ had it been hidden? Why didn\u2019t people talk?\nNo city can be unraveled in\
  \ only a few hours. But my mom and I race against the odds. Churches, fortresses,\
  \ riverbanks and parks. She observes meditative. It\u2019s late. We stop by a fountain\
  \ to drink water. If only it were enough to tame my hunger. My mom says we should\
  \ look for a place to eat, we still have 50 dinars exchanged. We search on less\
  \ populated streets. Something open! We peek in. Empty. The guy sitting at the table\
  \ outside watching the football game heads towards us. Rough, sullen he takes our\
  \ order. Mom insists she\u2019s not hungry or maybe our last dinars can buy us only\
  \ ... chicken medallions... yes! unusual, this will be it! We look around. It\u2019\
  s small, in between a modest, old restaurant and a sports bar with slightly faded\
  \ photos on the wall. Behind the bar a plump old lady, dressed all white is going\
  \ towards the kitchen. It looks like a family owned business. Quiet, an enclosed\
  \ world in the center of the turmoil. How has this place survived? Have we made\
  \ the right choice? My knife cuts through the crisp bacon into the tender chicken.\
  \ It melts in my mouth! I feel as though I\u2019m biting in a family specialty.\
  \ The lady glances through the kitchen curtain whipping her hands on her apron and\
  \ I feel a wave of affection rushing. I hope she can tell I could hug her as warmly\
  \ as my own grandmother.\nHe brings the bill, we can\u2019t cover the bread. He\
  \ smiles, his face softens- It\u2019s on the house!\n\u201CVibrant, beautiful, a\
  \ marvelous surprise\u201D she finally says.\nSo does a place little talked about\
  \ have little to show? Or is it just a terribly rare opportunity to form an authentic\
  \ opinion?"
