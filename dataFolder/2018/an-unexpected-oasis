Text: "\"Are you serious?\" I rolled my eyes, as I yet again slammed on the brakes.\
  \ \"Why won't they let us pass?\"\n\n\"Turkish drivers are the worst!\" Caleb agreed\
  \ gazing at the passing desert in the 112\xB0 heat.\n\nIt was week 3 of our Turkish\
  \ perimeter roadtrip. Eastern Turkey was blowing my mind. The food, the people,\
  \ the constant insistence on drinking \"\xE7ay\". The gas station attendant who\
  \ introduced us to his family and warned us of the ominous sounding \"night terrorists\"\
  . The hauntingly fog shrouded crags of the Ka\xE7kar mountains with their rivers\
  \ of dripping wildflowers. The immediate starkness of the rock desert that followed.\
  \ The emptiness and totality of Mount Ararat. The men who silently shared their\
  \ watermelon with us on the side of the road. The melted cheese dish of my dreams.\n\
  \nBut now, these people would NOT let us pass. Every time an opportunity arose,\
  \ I would press the uninspired gas pedal of our tiny Peugeot 107, feeling the already\
  \ limpid air conditioner try a little less hard as the car shuddered to accelerate\
  \ around these EVIL Turkish drivers. And every time, they would give their pickup\
  \ a light tap of the gas, zooming ahead, only to slow down as we were forced back\
  \ behind them.\n\nAt the next chance, I managed to coax the Peugeot equal to them.\
  \ But, this time as we glanced over, we were caught mid-glare by our Turkish tormentors,\
  \ a boy and girl about our age, cracking up.\n\n\"How are you\"? the girl called\
  \ in English.\n\n\"Trying to pass! And you?\"\n\n\"Come over for \xE7ay! Follow!\"\
  \ And with that they sped off.\n\nAfter chasing them through a nearby town, we entered\
  \ their house- to the loud Turkish greeting of their entire extended family. All\
  \ the women wore hijab. No one spoke a word of English save the limited vocabulary\
  \ of the girl, who turned out to be 16.\n\nThey served us \xE7ay in an elaborate\
  \ ceremony as we all crowded cross-legged on the floor. Then the food arrived. Although\
  \ we had just gorged ourselves on a kabob feast in a back alley of the last town\
  \ thanks to a dubious \"tourist policeman\", we found ourselves unable to say no.\
  \ As we were cajoled into eating more than our delicious share, we noticed several\
  \ members of the family going without. Caleb played music with the men; the girl\
  \ told me of her dream to become a doctor; something most women in her area would\
  \ never do. They proceeded to make us- just some strangers they kept from passing\
  \ on the road- a part of their family that evening. It was a lesson in humanity;\
  \ an unexpected oasis in the Turkish desert."
