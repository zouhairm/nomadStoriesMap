Text: "Paris. The city of love! The city of light! An enviable embodiment of French\
  \ sophistication \u2013 good food, fine wine and the cr\xE8me de la cr\xE8me of\
  \ cultural experience.\n\nThese images and the connotations they inspire have become\
  \ synonymous with the Parisian lifestyle. Even in my short time in the city, the\
  \ Eiffel Tower had its effect; Paris is a locality that boasts authentic beauty\
  \ at every corner. Yet as absurd as it might sound, Paris is a bruised city, and\
  \ how brilliantly so. \n\nIrrespective of Hollywood depictions and preconceived\
  \ assumptions, it is the crooked corners of the French capital that have inspired\
  \ generations. Whilst the grandeur of the Notre-Dame was impressive, I took a moment\
  \ to appreciate the flickering restaurant signs and the rouge-splattered wine lists\
  \ on uneven wicker tables. I paused to experience the floral scents of the Tuileries\
  \ but refused to avoid the hazy smoke of cobbled alleyways. Those two men, leaning\
  \ on the entrance to a run-down looking apartment, cigarettes between their teeth,\
  \ indifferent expression on their faces and a dirty mattress flung to the ground\
  \ at their side, they\u2019re Parisian. Sure I savoured the expensive glass of white\
  \ but was careful to remember the bitter taste of the cheap coffee purchased on\
  \ the side of the road. I reveled in the sunshine and the warm glow it cast on the\
  \ cobbles of Montmartre but didn\u2019t hide from the rain. I watched the painter\
  \ perched on his wooden stool in the middle of the square, he and his momentary\
  \ muse content to sit in the grey, the pitter-patter of raindrops scattering their\
  \ page. \n\nDo not allow these bruises, the rows of broken bicycles and tattered\
  \ theatre flyers, to become the content of whispered taboo alone. They\u2019re the\
  \ marks of a city that is loved. A city home to people that walk its crumbling streets\
  \ and visitors from across the globe, each and every one leaving their own stroke\
  \ on an imperfect Parisian canvas.\n\nOn a yellowing piece of paper beneath the\
  \ stairs of the Shakespeare and Company bookstore, I encountered a small-handwritten\
  \ note pinned to the wall. Reading \u2018the challenge is to write about real things,\
  \ magically\u2019 this messy scrawl reminded me of something rather important. It\
  \ is our ability as writers and adventurers alike to appreciate the charm of normality\
  \ that lends itself to the greatest rewards. \n\nThis array of imperfections may\
  \ have been the very last thing I expected, but it is upon their discovery that\
  \ Paris left me wanting more."
