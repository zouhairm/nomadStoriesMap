Text: "Great value. On a students budget I toured two weeks in Peru; spent less than\
  \ $2000. \nFlew into Lima; stayed at a Miraflores beach hostel. \nConsidered renting\
  \ a car or taking public transport to Cusco, where I was headed for the Inti Raymi\
  \ Festival & to climb Machu Picchu -- a decision that pushed me to the edge.\nPeru\
  \ Hop bus tour stopped at all the places I wanted to visit for the same price as\
  \ a flight from Lima to Cusco ($159). \nIn Paracas, took a boat tour to see the\
  \ penguins, seals & marine life on the Ballestas Islands. Enjoyed happy hour, dinner,\
  \ shopping, beach yoga & the Paracas History Museum of 'alleged' alien skulls. \n\
  In Ica, took a free tasting tour of how Peruvians make their national alcoholic\
  \ beverage: the Pisco Sour. Stayed in Huacachina, where we 4x4 raced in the sandy\
  \ red mountains & rode sand boards (like snowboarding). \nClimbed a tower to see\
  \ the Nazca lines. \nThe elevation is high; prepare to acclimate. Wanted to hike\
  \ Colca Canyon (11,500 ft), to see the Condors, but crunching time to get to Cusco\
  \ (11,152\u2032) & Machu Picchu (7,972\u2032) for the June 21st solstice. \nThree\
  \ days in Cusco, three days in Aguas Calientes & two days in Machu Picchu. \nIn\
  \ Cusco, hiked with locals in caves where my head almost got stuck. Laid on the\
  \ ground where the ancients rested; we prayed, meditated & felt Pachamama (earth\
  \ mother). \nThe Machu Picchu tour bus picked me up at 6 a.m. Our 4-day hike on\
  \ an alternative Inca trail included a 6-hour bike ride around mountain roads with\
  \ waterfalls, then a 3-hour river rafting excursion on the Urubamba River, then\
  \ we climbed a steep mountain for hours in the dark (wearing backpacks) to our cabins\
  \ where we had dinner, beers, did hand laundry & slept soundly. After breakfast\
  \ & a presentation on the 3800 varieties of Peruvian potatoes, coffee beans, cocoa,\
  \ coca & many local grown crops, we continued hiking for three more days. \nThe\
  \ most unusual thing I ever ate was a termite on a twig from a tree; why, because\
  \ everyone else tried it. \nOMG! Machu Picchu is spectacular! Bring your passport\
  \ for a Machu Picchu stamp. \nBack to Cusco! The festival lasts nine days. People\
  \ dress in costumes, masks, walk on stilts & dance in the streets. It's very crowded.\
  \ On the last day people rush to grab a chair facing the Plaza de Armas where the\
  \ parade marches through.  \nTook a bus to Puno; visited the floating islands of\
  \ Uros on Lake Titicaca. Rode a horse uphill drinking a beer to watch sunset. \n\
  Visit Peru! Have the time of your life."
