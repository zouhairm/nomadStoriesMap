Text: "I am sitting with my Dad in the breakfasting area of the Grand Court Hotel\
  \ in Jerusalem transfixed on the unashamed greed before me. Most people would appreciate\
  \ the symbolism. A woman, most probably a former Eastern Bloc shot putter, was busy\
  \ emptying the whole contents of the orange juice dispenser into what looked like\
  \ a 5 litre water bottle. No shame, just entitlement and pure concentration (excuse\
  \ the pun) as she expertly filled. The room, a Babel of languages, watched in collective\
  \ amazement. An aged Japanese eyebrow met my wry British smile.\nIn the pleasant\
  \ heat we strolled towards the Damascus Gate, the most beautiful of the Old City's\
  \ eight gates. All are accessible apart from the Golden Gate, where in 1541, the\
  \ Ottoman Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent, who built the current walls, ordered\
  \ it to be sealed shut. For Jews, the Messiah will pass through it when he arrives,\
  \ he did on Palm Sunday according to Christians, and will again. Suleiman, a pragmatic\
  \ Muslim, thought a good dollop of cement would put an early and embarrassing end\
  \ to the Messiah's mission from the Mount of Olives directly in front of it.\nWe\
  \ later arrived at the courtyard of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre after walking\
  \ the Via Dolorosa, the route Jesus carried the cross. There, leaning against the\
  \ top right window of the Romanesque church, was the Immovable Ladder, described\
  \ by Pope Paul VI as the visible symbol of Christian divisions. Since the mid 18th\
  \ Century it has represented a pact between the six ecumenical orders not to move\
  \ anything within the church without the consent of the other five. Such are the\
  \ tensions between them, even the 500 year old cast iron key has been entrusted\
  \ to the same Muslim family. \nThrough the entrance I was shocked to see adults\
  \ crying as they used cloths to rub the Stone of Unction where Joseph of Arimathea\
  \ prepared Jesus' body for burial. The stone dates from 1810 but no matter to the\
  \ faithful. We then walked the stone steps to the right to Golgotha where the cross\
  \ stood. The rock itself is covered by glass and it was here that a miracle occurred.\
  \ There, pilgrims and tourists waited patiently as one by one, they leant down to\
  \ touch it through a small hole in the middle. It was my Dad's turn. He stretched\
  \ to touch the rock and, like the veil of the temple 2000 years earlier, there was\
  \ a sudden tear; not the veil of Temple but my Dad's lovingly pressed salmon shirt.\
  \ A prominent moment in his life marred, a prominent moment in mine enhanced."
