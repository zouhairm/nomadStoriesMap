Text: "Growing up, I didn\u2019t feel accepted within my family. I was provided with\
  \ messages, sometimes said out loud, sometimes implied; \u201CYou\u2019re worthless\u201D\
  \ \u201CYou\u2019re not good enough\u201D \u201CYou\u2019re a burden\u201D \u201C\
  You\u2019re good for nothing\u201D \u201CYou\u2019re ugly\u201D \u201CI wish you\
  \ were dead\u201D. I was often punished by being dragged out of the house in socks\
  \ and locked outside for extended periods of time. I was left on the side of the\
  \ highway during family trips. One day, during my teenaged years, my parents asked\
  \ if I wanted to go camping with them. I remember feeling surprised and excited\
  \ at the inclusion and packed my backpack. When we arrived at a small town, almost\
  \ 2 hours from home, my parents asked if I wanted to call a friend to join me. I\
  \ walked to the payphone, and I turned to see my parents throw my backpack out of\
  \ their car while they shouted, \u201CGet a job, get a life\u201D and they drove\
  \ away\u2026 After that, I met people that I felt accepted by. I met kids who sold\
  \ drugs, school drop-outs and others that felt rejected or were rejected by their\
  \ parents, school or social groups. I moved from couch to couch, party to party.\
  \ I occasionally slept in abandoned campers or under hotel stairs or in ATM machine\
  \ areas. They were a family to me! Then, I discovered I was pregnant. Because I\u2019\
  d spent my time drinking and drugging, I was unsure when I had conceived. The doctor\
  \ said I was about 3 months along. I looked at a picture of what a fetus looked\
  \ like at three months, and for me, things became real. I had hope.\nLife is a journey.\
  \ No one grows up thinking, \u201CWhen I get older, I want to have mental illness.\
  \ I want to be homeless, and have addictions, and feel like I\u2019m not accepted\u201D\
  . Life just happens. No one is immune. \nMy journey in life took me to help others.\
  \ I have been honored to meet some interesting, funny, creative, resilient and beautiful\
  \ humans who have been plagued with mental health or addiction related challenges.\
  \ We are all humans. We all have brains and minds and mental health. We all want\
  \ to be acknowledged and accepted. We all want connection and love. WE ALL HAVE\
  \ A STORY.If we are going to get through this journey of life, we\u2019ve got to\
  \ do it together. Look at the humans around you; the humans on the street, the humans\
  \ on the bus, the humans in your home, the humans in your workplace, and treat them\
  \ as you would like to be treated. You don\u2019t have to have money. All you need\
  \ is to be human. Interactions can be life-changing and meaningful, so make each\
  \ one count."
