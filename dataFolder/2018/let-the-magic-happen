Text: "Country of miracles, Norway - I call it neither east nor west just north way\
  \ is my favourite Norway! I was following my instinct to follow magic that is going\
  \ to happen in life, on earth, in sky among this universe which is cloud free, chillest\
  \ of the chill, darkest of the dark and prettiest if the pretty! My journey to hunt\
  \ light began in a cargo ship where hundreds walked in and hundreds moved out, all\
  \ in the hunt if light like ? Nehh no two stories and no two journey are same just\
  \ like no two wavelength of light are same! \n\nThere was a hole in me where light\
  \ needed to pour and fill the love, compassion and fire that can ignite humanity\
  \ to bring the world closer!\n\nAs the cruise from Bergen progressed it left me\
  \ speechless with the views and offerings of shire excursions! That grey city Scape\
  \ and polar aquarium, splash of cutest polar bear and aquatic marine animals bumping\
  \ jumping, small tiny boat from farthest point sailing to Ur closest horizon getting\
  \ it bigger day by day coming to closer...\n\nAnd sail further with raising a toss\
  \ to Arctic journey saying 'skall' and enjoy being one of those Vikings...\n\nAppreciate\
  \ the architectural marvel of this country who made beautiful arctic church and\
  \ give us an opportunity to experience hum back whales, listen to her ultrasonic\
  \ whistle...trust me it was thrilling!"
