Text: "It was early in June when I decided to take a solo trip to the land of spiritual\
  \ awakening \u2013 Rishikesh. The sky was filled with dark clouds; the air was moist\
  \ and chilly.  Northern parts of India are notorious for the rampant crime against\
  \ women. As a rule, public transport is safer than private ones. \nOn landing at\
  \ Jolly Grant Airport at Dehradun, I was looking for the nearest public bus station\
  \ to Anand Dham Ashram on Lakshman Jhula Road.  \u201CThere are no public buses\
  \ that run from Dehradun Airport to Rishikesh Madam, you can take a private taxi\
  \ from there\u201D pointed out the security officer. I took a deep breath and walked\
  \ towards the ticket window. \nMy diver Manoj, was a thin man in his late thirties.\
  \ I took a picture of the car with its number plate on my phone camera, and sent\
  \ it to my family, just in case. He stared at me warily. We soon took off on a one\
  \ hour drive to Lakshman Jhula Road. Around 15 minutes through the journey, suddenly,\
  \ the car changed the route to the left instead of right. \u201CThe road to the\
  \ Aashram is towards the right\u201D I said. No reply. My heart was beating faster.\
  \ I asked again. He pointed out to a petrol pump on the edge of the road. \u201C\
  Sigh\u201D. I leaned back. \nAround 30 minutes through, Manoj stopped the car and\
  \ stepped outside. \u201CI will be back in 5 minutes\u201D he said. Behind, I saw\
  \ Manoj talking to someone. \u201CAnother man?\u201DI thought. \u201CWhat if they\
  \ have a gang?\u201D I was nervous. It was just past sunset, the spot being perfectly\
  \ conducive for criminal activity. \"Natures Call\" he said. I had missed sight\
  \ of the public urinal nearby.\n\u201CIt\u2019s time for Amarnath Yatra, this is\
  \ why all the crowd\u201D said Manoj, trying to break the silence. The Aashram was\
  \ now 15 minutes away. As long as we were on the right road, I was fine. As we went\
  \ farther along the way, Manoj and I spoke about tourism in Rishikesh, people of\
  \ Uttarakhand and Garhwali culture. He spoke about his journey from being a flood\
  \ victim to taking up a job in a taxi company and his dream of starting his own\
  \ private taxi business. I told him about my connections and how I could help. \u201C\
  Come to my home Madamji, my wife and daughters will be happy to host you for tea\u201D\
  . \nI found it rather Ironic, that the same man, who I had pictured as a rapist\
  \ just half an hour ago, was now a friend. \u201CSure Manoj, I\u2019d love to\u201D\
  \ I said. \nAs we reached the Ashram, I took down Manoj\u2019s number and promised\
  \ to call his services in case I needed a taxi. I gave him a tip of 100 bucks. He\
  \ smiled and drove away."
