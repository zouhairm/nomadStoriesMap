Text: "Scene 1. It was a Sunday morning when I was sighting down the Cusco city from\
  \ up there. What amazing view I was appreciating! I was about to land to the destination\
  \ where it will take me to the lost city of Incas. The lost city that helped me\
  \ to find myself. It wasn\xB4t the first time I was planning to visit Machu Picchu,\
  \ but it was the first time that the universe conspired to make it happen.\n\nScene\
  \ 2. I didn\xB4t choose the best season. The weather forecast was indicating rain\
  \ but who knows, I thought. Without expecting, Pachamama was receiving me with a\
  \ sunny and welcoming sky. And more and more I had the feeling to be in the right\
  \ place at the right moment.  \n\nScene 3. It was night and I was alone although\
  \ surrounded by roommates. A little bit tired maybe because of the soroche but at\
  \ the same time excited, I couldn\xB4t sleep.\n\nScene 4. You were seated in front\
  \ of the McDonalds of Plaza de Armas. I liked what I saw. It was cold and we went\
  \ to seek a pub. While I was trying the pisco sour and you were drinking a sprite\
  \ we were beginning to know each other\xB4s world. Unexpectedly, we had so much\
  \ in common. You were telling me about your travels experiences and how you left\
  \ behind your life and career in Paris. I had good feelings and I felt happiness\
  \ at that moment. But it didn\xB4t last long after you said it was your last night\
  \ in that city.\n\nScene 5. Going along with me toward to the hostel I was lodged,\
  \ while the traffic lights were red you out of the blue said \u201Cquiero besarte\u201D\
  .\n\nScene 6. Seated in front of the computer back to my bored and routine life\
  \ I was texting you and thinking that job and life weren\xB4t making sense anymore.\n\
  \nScene 7. Suddenly I was with you. Traveling full time, exploring new lands and\
  \ cultures and with no intention of stopping! That's what I've always wanted. Is\
  \ that a dream?! Please don\xB4t wake me up!"
