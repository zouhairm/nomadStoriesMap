Text: "I was turning eighteen, planning a trip to the other end of the world.\n  South\
  \ America, Brazil, Rio de Janeiro \u2013 enter. Google showed me the pictures of\
  \ the exotic beaches and breath-taking landscapes. I did not need to think twice,\
  \ especially when I heard heavy rain drops tapping on my window. I wanted to be\
  \ out of Britain. \n  Fifteen minutes later, my trip was booked. I could not believe\
  \ that I was going to Brazil in a couple of month's time.\n  \u201CThere is no way\
  \ you should go\u201D, my parents said when I told them. I saw their point of view.\
  \ Yet, I could not resist. I had to go.\n Time passed. Summer started and my classes\
  \ were over. I was supposed to make my University application but I had no idea\
  \ of what I wanted to study. My parents were concerned but the only thing I knew\
  \ was that I was going to Brazil in one week's time. My mind was already time-travelling\
  \ to that moment...\n  \u201CCan you believe that I will see the sculpture of the\
  \ Christ in Rio?\u201D I was asking my parents on the way to the airport. Twelve\
  \ hours later I was in Brazil. I realised that nobody spoke English well. The hotel\
  \ staff explained  everything in basic words. I did not know a word of Portuguese\
  \ too. I felt alienated and I wished that I could be understood...\n  While exploring\
  \ the neighbourhood, I felt every eye on me. Here I was \u2013 a pale white guy\
  \ looking completely lost. I was running out of money. As I walked I saw a man pointing\
  \ his finger at me. \"You're American?!\" he shouted in English, all excited. \"\
  No, I come from England.\" I replied surprised. I was so happy that he could understand\
  \ me and I hoped that he could help me. \"Do you know where I can exchange my money?\"\
  \ I asked enthusiastically. The man got closer and whispered \"You can't ask this...\
  \ Do not say you have money on you... You're calling for trouble!\"\n  I felt embarrassed\
  \ to be so na\xEFve but the man helped me and explained how to get to \u201CCristo\
  \ Redentor\u201D. I was lucky this time.\n  When I got to the statue of Christ I\
  \ took a look at the panoramic view of Rio. It was beautiful. The sun was going\
  \ down and the sky was clear and intensely blue.\n  What do I do after this trip?\
  \ I kept asking myself. I turned and faced the sculpture. I looked at the opened\
  \ arms, the face, and suddenly... I received enlightenment...\n  When I landed in\
  \ the UK, my parents were waiting to collect me. \"How was it?\" they asked but\
  \ I only said \"Mum, Dad, I know what I want to study... I want to learn Portuguese.\"\
  \ \n  They looked at me and smiled."
