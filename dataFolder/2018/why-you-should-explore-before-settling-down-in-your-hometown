Text: "Did you know that 80% of people when they \"grow up\" end up living within\
  \ 20 miles of their hometown? Shocking (and scary)! I am here to argue my case that\
  \ for those who have yet to \"settle down\", PLEASE at least explore your country,\
  \ live outside of your home state,go on a road trip/soul exploration journey before\
  \ you decide that your home state is the one and only place for you. And if it is\
  \ in the end, I am so happy for you. But 57% of people never live outside their\
  \ home state even once to see if somewhere else is a better fit.\n\nI was born in\
  \ Staten Island, New York, and raised in New Jersey. Never a fan of New Jersey,\
  \ newly single and nothing to tie me down, I decided I would venture off to figure\
  \ out where I wanted to live. I decided I would go on a solo journey to four places\
  \ I had never been and see which would steal my heart. I got on a plane headed to\
  \ Phoenix and the whole time on the flight I was reciting back to myself \"THIS\
  \ IS CRAZY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING.\" Which, at the time was terrifying, but also freeing.\
  \ I ventured through Sedona taking in the glorious, sunny red rocks and the perfect\
  \ sunsets and sunrises. I went on a hike to Cathedral Rock and headed off to the\
  \ Grand Canyon. \n\nVisiting the Grand Canyon for me, like most will say, was surreal.\
  \ It was damn cold (end of November), but it was magical. I perched myself on this\
  \ boulder and watched the sunset over the majestic canyon that mother earth gave\
  \ us.Next, I went to Page, where I saw Antelope Canyon & Horseshoe Bend. On my drive\
  \ back to the airport, I was reflecting on the past few days. It had been established-\
  \ Arizona was at the top of my list.  I flew to Colorado, which- full disclosure,\
  \ I had seen before. A few months prior I took a trip to see my favorite band at\
  \ Red Rocks. But having only seen Colorado in summer, I wanted to see it again in\
  \ winter to be sure I loved it in all seasons. It turns out, I did. \n\nI decided\
  \ at 25 I didn't want to wake up at 50 still living in New Jersey and ask myself...Why\
  \ did I never explore if I wanted to live anywhere else? Why did I allow myself\
  \ to just settle in this place that I grew up even if I've never loved it here?\
  \ So all I ask of you, is to PLEASE explore before you decide to settle down in\
  \ your hometown. Whether it be internationally (if you want to live in a different\
  \ country- more power to you), or domestically. But whatever you do, be 100% sure\
  \ in your decision, because it could last a lifetime."
