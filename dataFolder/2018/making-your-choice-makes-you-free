Text: "She has just moved to that small town. For her, moving from a capital with\
  \ millions of inhabitants to a town with some thousands was supposed to be more\
  \ than an adventure, a break. And she really needed it. But being new in a small\
  \ place where you do not speak the local language can be so many things: exciting,\
  \ frustrating, interesting, lonely, anger\u2026and an endless row of adjectives,\
  \ feelings, emotions, colours, reactions, and perceptions.\nThat day she went to\
  \ the supermarket and when entered in, two different people greeted her. Two people\
  \ that took from her a smile of someone who is amazed and does not exactly know\
  \ why. Actually, this is the end of the story. \nWithout knowing how she was not\
  \ only known in the neighbourhood, but also somehow appreciated she felt in that\
  \ exactly moment that she had reached to that point you start to belong to somewhere.\n\
  She was wondering so many times where her roots were. Especially when she was thinking\
  \ in coming back. But, coming back to where? She started to think that we, human\
  \ beings, have legs instead of roots because moving, travelling, exercise, not being\
  \ motionless is a must. She started to think that her reason in the world was unknown,\
  \ but for sure is not just belong to somewhere, but to everywhere. \nThat day, when\
  \ she went into the supermarket, the woman from the fruit shop asked her how did\
  \ she feel. If she liked the city she was last week. If she liked the last fruit\
  \ she bought that had come from the house of a family member. That day, the boy\
  \ from the bowling centre asked her when she was coming back for one more game.\n\
  This is how she liked to travel. For a long time. Being able to know not the place,\
  \ but the people. Spending time enough in a place that you can know how life flows,\
  \ what people feel, who is who, when events happen and where the best fruit is sold.\
  \ When you are not travelling. When you are living the place. Where you enter in\
  \ a supermarket and people know you. When you start to feel one more, then, time\
  \ for the next destination."
