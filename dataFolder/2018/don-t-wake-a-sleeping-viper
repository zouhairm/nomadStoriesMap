Text: "About an hour into the hike in Serra Geral national park we passed by a sleeping\
  \ viper, and our guide took that as the right moment to mention that the mandatory\
  \ shin guards were to protect from venomous snake bites. The saying goes \"don't\
  \ wake a sleeping viper,\" but I suppose it's possible that some small snake could\
  \ take wake from a luminous slumber and, like me, end up searching for adventure\
  \ away from home.\n\nIf I could reflect back on the time I spent in Brazil, the\
  \ predominant thought that comes to my mind is color. Vibrant, vivid, wild color.\
  \ Saturated color, the type that you see in the early technicolor films and the\
  \ first rays of day that hold an immense repository of one concept: possibility.\
  \ That's how I feel about Brazil, the South American giant country. Something in\
  \ the air is permanently wet, a dewey birth of life and feeling bursting forth from\
  \ an indigenous back ground that is quickly fading into the past and giving way\
  \ to a new first world nation, which is strong with maintaining it\u2019s vivacious\
  \ character through song, art, and political activism. \n\nI always imagined that\
  \ I would feel unsafe in Brazil, but it's not like that at all. Being in there seems\
  \ like trivial questions fade away and the only important thing is living life urgently\
  \ for today. A kind of permanent summer lays across the land the land, staying in\
  \ the hearts and minds of the people as they live their lives in a way that is fully\
  \ conscious but only half serious. It seems as if the next vacation is today and\
  \ work is an excuse to pass the time. The people I have met in Brazil are among\
  \ the kindest most genuine people who I have had the pleasure to meet, so very passionate\
  \ about making the world into a better place, all working hard and yet very laid\
  \ back at the same time. Perhaps it's this nature of the people that shapes the\
  \ nation, forming a unique paradox which contributes a quirky kind of character\
  \ to the country. And the food, oh the food. You can sit me in the worst grungiest,\
  \ dirtiest side bar of Brazil and I will be a happy girl, for anything I get from\
  \ the menu will be cooked with so much love and flavor packed into it that I will\
  \ leave feeling as if I've just had a moment of sheer, undefined, unrestricted euphoria.\
  \ Black beans forever, p\xE3o de queijo, you name it and it's going to my belly.\
  \ It's another world. And it\u2019s almost enough to keep me going back to that\
  \ country forever."
