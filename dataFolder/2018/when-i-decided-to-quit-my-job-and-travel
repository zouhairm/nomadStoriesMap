  \ question, \u201CWhat are you doing with your life? Is this what you want to do\
  \ for the rest of your life?\u201D The same question hit me too.I just finished\
  \ my college, got a job for myself in one of the MNCs and started earning by myself.\
  \ However, deep inside I was not happy. I had the feeling that I don\u2019t belong\
  \ here. I was disappointed with the way my life was shaping up. I talked to my friends\
  \ about this. I asked them, \u201CIs this it? Will I be working at the same place\
  \ for the next twenty years, 9 to 5 and wait for the weekend to have some to myself?\
  \ Is this how it\u2019s going to be?\u201D\nMost of them tried to convince me that\
  \ I was new to the job and it is all going to be fine. I took their advice and gave\
  \ it some time and hoped that it will be alright. Months passed by, and I realized\
  \ it\u2019s not going to be fine, this is my life now. NO. This is not the life\
  \ I want to live. I was thinking a lot and I was trying to figure out how I get\
  \ what I want out of my life. I was in depression for a while. I spoke to my parents\
  \ that I am not happy with my life at present. They asked me to quit the job and\
  \ come back home\nAgain, I had a big question in my mind, \u201CWhat am I going\
  \ to do when I get back home?\u201D Either this job or some other job. I will be\
  \ stuck with the same problem again. I had been taking most of my life decision\
  \ wrong. But there was something I was never confused about, TRAVELING. I wanted\
  \ to travel the world. I wanted to explore the places that I had only seen on the\
  \ maps. I wanted to meet people around the globe. But I was so lost in my way that\
  \ I didn\u2019t had any idea how to do it.I always thought I\u2019ll wait for the\
  \ right time. But let me tell you something, there is no right time. It\u2019s all\
  \ about taking your chances and redeeming yourself. We always think that we are\
  \ not ready to do the right thing. We wait and we will never be ready. The thing\
  \ is no one was ready ever. You just have to go out there and do it. If you keep\
  \ waiting for the right time to come, trust me it\u2019s not happening. I knew I\
  \ had to make a choice, either to adjust and be happy with the job I have now or\
  \ start chasing my dreams. I knew what I had to choose and I knew that it was difficult\
  \ but it was worth taking a chance. I\u2019d rather regret now than regretting 50\
  \ years from now about the chance I did not take.December 6, 2016 I quit my job.\
  \ With one month salary and some savings I decided to explore my country"
