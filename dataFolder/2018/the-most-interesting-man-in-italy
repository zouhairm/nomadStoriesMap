Text: "In mostly broken Italian, we secured a train ride to Florence. As foodies,\
  \ this was our Mecca. No food would be out of bounds, including the infamous tripe\
  \ sandwich. We would soon realize the best part of our journey wouldn\u2019t be\
  \ what we ate or saw, but who we met along the way. \nHis name is Vittorio Del Bono\
  \ Venezze, and he is probably the most interesting man in Italy. I don\u2019t know\
  \ how he got four names, but he deserved them all. His full-bodied shape verified\
  \ his love of good wine and cheese. Sporting a well-worn leather jacket and aviator\
  \ sunglasses, he informed us that we were about to embark on one of the greatest\
  \ culinary tours of all time. \nVittorio escorted us to his family\u2019s villa,\
  \ dating back to the 16th century. We were welcomed with an amazing meal. The amuse\
  \ bouche was a grilled toast point, adorned with truffle shavings, and finished\
  \ with a drizzle of homemade honey and olive oil. My taste buds danced the tango\
  \ as the meal progressed in this deliciously lavish fashion. \nWith a full belly,\
  \ I poked my head in the kitchen and found a stocky grandma skillfully whisking\
  \ and stirring. In Italian, I thanked her for the delicious meal. Her smile spoke\
  \ a thousand words, and as she clasped her hands together, she acknowledged our\
  \ appreciation for her century old recipes. I feared this adventure was nearing\
  \ an end, but Vittorio was having too much fun. \u201CTo the winery!\u201D he proclaimed.\
  \ \nThe winery was founded long ago--the cellar was used as a shelter for locals\
  \ seeking refuge during World War II. As the story goes, they ran in and stumbled\
  \ out! In this very cellar, Vittorio taught us about wine tasting. He swirled violently\
  \ and aerated aggressively. With flared nostrils, he mightily inhaled. Sucking in\
  \ wine and air, he swished and sloshed. We followed suit, surely looking like idiots\
  \ as we pretended to exact notes like trained sommeliers. Happily drunk, our private\
  \ tour ended in front of a gas station pump\u2026but looks can be deceiving. Here,\
  \ locals pedaled up and filled their own jugs with Chianti. Can it get more Italian\
  \ than that?\nVittorio was our connection to a more fulfilling and cultural adventure.\
  \ Sure, we saw some amazing places and had some great meals, but it\u2019s Vittorio\
  \ Del Bono Venezze that I will tell stories about. In parting, he withdrew a map\
  \ and pointed to the best place for a picnic of local meats, cheeses and wine. \
  \ \u201CTell them you know Vittorio,\u201D he said, \u201Cand you\u2019ll get the\
  \ special treatment.\u201D But that\u2019s another story for another time."
