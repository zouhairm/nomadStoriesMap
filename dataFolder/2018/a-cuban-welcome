Text: "After spending 2.5 weeks sailing along the southern coast of Cuba, I was more\
  \ than ready to sail into Cienfuegos and explore a bit of this legendary country.\
  \ The marina staff were friendly and all the happier to have a foreigner who speaks\
  \ Spanish. After tidying up the boat, I stepped off the boat and proceeded to chat\
  \ with Ben, one of the security guards at the marina. I asked him if he could give\
  \ me a glimpse of Cuban life and he agreed.  \n\nThe next evening Ben arrives dressed\
  \ to the nines. We walk slowly along the waterfront as he tells me about Cuban history.\
  \ Some of his friends are walking in the opposite direction and he introduces me.\
  \ They instantly welcome me into their group and I find myself lost in a slang I\u2019\
  m not accustomed to. Ben tries his best to translate, but I don\u2019t mind. It\u2019\
  s part of the experience!\n\nWe find a seat and chat non-stop about everything and\
  \ anything. We share a laugh as we open our mouths at the same time to satisfy our\
  \ curiosities. He tells me his opinion of the government. He doesn\u2019t feel suppressed\
  \ or disadvantaged, just frustrated about low wages. He is proud to be Cuban and\
  \ have a socialist government. He asks me what it\u2019s like in the countries I\u2019\
  ve lived in. His jaw dropped as I talked about a freedom and independence he has\
  \ never experienced.\n\nDancing is in the Cuban blood, so we find ourselves at a\
  \ lively open air discoteca. When I look up, I see a beautiful starry night like\
  \ glitter on a black ceiling. There are disco balls, strobe lights and a gentle\
  \ breeze providing an oasis from the smothering heat. The corners of my mouth turn\
  \ up as I enjoy the moment.\_\n\nAs we dance, a guy shouts \u201CBen!!\u201D and\
  \ waves him over. It\u2019s one of his friend\u2019s who is a professional dancer.\
  \ Him and his girlfriend dance a raunchy raggaeton next to us as we laugh away.\
  \ His friend told me to watch his girlfriend and do the same as her. Then he placed\
  \ Ben\u2019s hand on my hips and told Ben to follow him. The dance competition began!!\
  \ Next, it was the girls turn to pin the guys up against the wall and have a dance\
  \ off.  Even though I couldn\u2019t always understand their slang, we were laughing\
  \ so hard together! \n\nThe music stopped, we bought a $4 bottle of rum and went\
  \ to a party on the beach. After some convincing, they got me in the cold water\
  \ and we floated on our backs, talked about the stars and giggled the rest of the\
  \ night away like we had known each other for years."
