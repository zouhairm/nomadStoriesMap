Text: "Opened my eyes to watch the horizon decorated with the peaks that were rolling\
  \ and merging into one another. The top looked mysteriously foggy an eerie but beautiful.\
  \ This was the setting of Agumbe, known for the constant pelting of the water droplets\
  \ onto the face of the onlooker. I was supposed to trek in these conditions. After\
  \ one look, I let out a sigh that is mixed with anxiety and deep disbelief. \nTo\
  \ an avid trekker, the path may seem easy but to a rookie like me it seemed Herculean.\
  \ The terrain would not be my friend for sure. Fear was my aura, I had no choice\
  \ but to face it. Finally, mustering every bit of courage like a kid picking out\
  \ fallen candies, I started. The rustic and enchanted Kavaledurga fort had an enigma\
  \ that triggered the curiosity of its audience. \nThe trek itself was a fun-filled\
  \ one. The highs and lows at each nook and corner made it impossible to predict\
  \ what we might or might not see. The otherwise chirpy crowd, were silenced after\
  \ reaching an opening. This soon turned to screams and the people were completely\
  \ losing their minds. That was when the immense task seemed more mighty. We had\
  \ to face the blood-sucking yet painless threat of leeches, throughout the ascent.\
  \ Terrified, I moved on. Before I knew it, we were atop the peak on which the fort\
  \ stands. After having paid the price with our blood. Quite literally! \nThankfully,\
  \ I was not kissed by any of the bloodsuckers, for now. But fate had a bonus for\
  \ me. This came in the form of slippery rocks, which was just washed by the rain.\
  \ Seemed a great sight to behold, as it reminded the onlooker of mini waterfalls.\
  \ I made the mistake of carrying the waste bags with the remains of our lunch. BIG\
  \ mistake. After reaching the halfway mark after a session of intense blood cleansing\
  \ for the group. Two cows out of nowhere came charging at me, There was no escape.\
  \ I couldn't run, because of the immensely slippery rocks and the slope. I definitely\
  \ couldn't go uphill to the entire herd. The narrow path gave me no choice but to\
  \ brace myself for impact with my back against the fort wall. As I was torn between\
  \ making the vain and instinctive efforts to push the cow or leave the bag and dash.\
  \ Fortunately, another cow attacked the one charging at me from my left. They rammed\
  \ into each other and thus was safe! THANK GOD! \nAfter a long itchy trek downhill.\
  \ I got back to the camp only to find not one but 16 leeches on my body sucking\
  \ away my the blood in all glory. I DID NOT REGISTER FOR THIS"
