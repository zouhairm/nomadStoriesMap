Text: "The moment that I took the decision to travel by myself to another country\
  \ was emblematic for me and represented an important symbolic aspect on my life.\
  \ Last year, I decided to get the opportunity of a scholarship to study abroad.\
  \ \n\nIt is true that it was solely three weeks and in a country that has a frontier\
  \ in common to the mine, which is Argentina. Nevertheless, I truly understand on\
  \ my own that it represented so much for me, as an only son that had never had experiences\
  \ in which it was necessary to develop independence and an autonomous emotion to\
  \ take care on himself. I would be in a student house, without the comfort that\
  \ I am used to, where food probably would not taste in the way that I appreciate\
  \ and cleanliness would be scarce. In a nutshell, it is possible to see from that\
  \ my lack of confidence to fly to there, inasmuch as I started to realize that,\
  \ as a matter of fact, I am a spoiled boy with few situations in the memory that\
  \ could teach me the art of being a resilient and a strong individual. \n\nIn this\
  \ fashion the challenge might start since a brief goodbye to my daddy, who followed\
  \ me until the airport, to arriving in a place that does not possess your fluent\
  \ language. Then, already installed in the room that was called mine for three weeks,\
  \ I got in contact with the native people who received me in front of the building\
  \ combined. It was an energic Argentinean women with an italian ascendance easily\
  \ detected through her strong movements with hands and the loud level of voice.\
  \ She introduced me to the other boys in the house and suddenly a bright happiness\
  \ occurred me in front of the idea of being not only among Argentineans, but also\
  \ among people from different parts of the world that was living there. I knew that\
  \ I had to sustain the responsibility to stay where I chose to travel and, for my\
  \ surprise, it did not take too much time to be involved in the new atmosphere.\n\
  \nLiving inside an amount of diversity was the key factor to a so successful trip.\
  \ Connections happened without my control, what it means to affirm that I established\
  \ ties of relationship specially with whom lived under the same household as me.\
  \ In the end of the vacation, the necessity of the establishment of new friendships\
  \ taught me that I could find somebody to trust, even that I have met this one since\
  \ just one day. Connecting with new people has a special feeling, which was the\
  \ instrument to turn my apprehensive expectation into the peace of positive unforgettable\
  \ memories."
