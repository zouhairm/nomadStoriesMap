Text: "The near-constant photos of my Spanish adventures hadn\u2019t been enough,\
  \ I saw as he walked through the Cartagena cruise ship port gates. His face held\
  \ the content that only someone who has returned to their true home can hold, and\
  \ as we hugged hello I knew we both felt happy only as someone who is in the arms\
  \ of their best friend can be. It was through furtive messages on questionable wi-fi\
  \ that we had come to realise that not only would we be on the same continent, we\
  \ would be in the same country, if only for a day. And for people who are more often\
  \ than not on opposite sides of the world, this is not an opportunity to be missed,\
  \ even if it means an overnight bus ride with only the sleep snatched when the bus\
  \ was travelling down a flat road, or days of pleading to have an afternoon off\
  \ when your ship docks in your home country.\nFirst I wanted to see his world, his\
  \ floating city. I was no stranger to the giant ships but it never got less exciting\
  \ to stand on the decks with the salty breeze whipping my hair around until it got\
  \ caught in my glasses and the sound of the sea washing past, or so I could only\
  \ imagine today, and for now that was good enough. Of course, if you don\u2019t\
  \ play trivia you haven\u2019t really been on a cruise ship, and so it was that\
  \ we joined an English family in their trivia (here it is necessary to mention that\
  \ cruise trivia is a highly competitive extreme-sport, don\u2019t be fooled by the\
  \ smiles and little pencils) and we won, the fact that we were the only team considered\
  \ to be highly irrelevant. Prizes are prizes and egos are egos.\nNext it was on\
  \ to the main street of Cartagena, with the sun beating down on our shoulders, thankfully\
  \ sunscreened to an almost-reflective whiteness. We were on a mission to have the\
  \ most Spanish afternoon possible, and the first stop on our list was helado de\
  \ turr\xF3n, finally able to share our nougat-induced excitement with each other\
  \ instead of with friends who looked slightly confused when we explained what it\
  \ was we were eating. Sugar cravings satisfied, we were attracted to a bar by the\
  \ luring notes of old salsa music and its walls lined with money from all over the\
  \ world. I donated a note to the wall and we ordered tinto de verano, the sweet\
  \ taste of lemonade and red wine all at once the best thing we had ever drunk, despite\
  \ having had it many times in our lives.\nIt wasn\u2019t new that day, but this\
  \ connection made while travelling six months earlier was the one that mattered\
  \ the most that summer in Spain."
