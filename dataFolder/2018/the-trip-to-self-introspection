Text: "Sitting in the car for six hours, I left the plains behind and watched the\
  \ sun fade away. The color of the sky turned into a darker shade of blue and orange.\
  \ The snow-capped mountains hid behind the mist and the branches of the tall oak\
  \ trees danced in the breeze cold enough to leave its effect on your soul. That\
  \ sight changed my concept of \u2018realism.\u2019 \nIt all started with my friend\
  \ challenging me to go on a trip to Mussoorie all by myself. Being someone who hardly\
  \ leaves her room for more than an hour, this was something I could never picture\
  \ myself doing.\nCarrying my backpack and gripping the phone in my hands, I found\
  \ myself walking towards the Kempty waterfall which was about 1364 meters high.\
  \ The sound of the bubbles forming and water pouring down welcomed me with open\
  \ arms. I stood there, allowing the cold water to sprinkle all over my face. I had\
  \ always pictured myself reading a novel and sipping my bitter coffee watching the\
  \ mountains, but could never gather the courage to do so. Maybe that\u2019s why\
  \ friend pushed me to go there.\nThe place I was most excited to see was an old\
  \ cemetery from the British era. I continued the day without any delay. The white\
  \ bricked chapel with a pink rooftop is something hard to forget. It reminded me\
  \ of a book I read a long time ago. I wanted to paint a picture, but I decided to\
  \ stick with photography. I had always seen cemeteries in movies and television\
  \ shows but never got the chance to actually visit one. \nDeep inside my writer\u2019\
  s mind, I thought it would be a good way to get inspired and write a spooky story.\
  \ Nothing like that happened. For some reason, I liked the silence that was present\
  \ around me and found the peace quite satisfying.\nSix hundred meters away, I came\
  \ across a couple of tea stalls.  I couldn\u2019t resist the strong aroma of the\
  \ ginger tea being served in clay teacups. I went there and ordered a cup without\
  \ hesitation and avoided a long conversation with the lady behind the counter. Socializing\
  \ is something I always try my best to avoid. \nI saw an old couple sitting at the\
  \ table across me. They were tourists.\n\u201CI\u2019m so glad we finally decided\
  \ to come here. I love it,\u201D the man said to his wife.\nHis wife said nothing\
  \ but smiled, and then they both shifted their gaze towards the magnificent view\
  \ in front of their eyes. \nNever in a million years, could I have expected to witness\
  \ something so surreal. Traveling on my own seemed impossible to me in the beginning\
  \ and enjoying every moment of it was the last thing I expected."
