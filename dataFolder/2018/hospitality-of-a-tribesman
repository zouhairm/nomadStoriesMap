Text: "The air was bone dry and scorching hot as the Ethiopian sun relentlessly beat\
  \ down around me. I turned to my left and was greeted with the soft smiling eyes,\
  \ open face and trademark white smile of a local tribesman. He told me his name\
  \ was Shoma, he was a student on his way home to the Karo tribe deep in the heart\
  \ of the Omo valley.\n \nHis offer to join him was too good to refuse. Within 20\
  \ minutes we were clambering up the side of a lorry packed tight with local tribes\
  \ people. One foot planted on a bag of flour, the other on the thigh of a local\
  \ tribeswoman. I clutched to the side of the truck for dear life as we set off on\
  \ an extremely rough and sweltering hot three-hour ride. \n \nAlong the way Shoma\
  \ told me stories of his tribe; like all Ethiopians he was extremely proud, yet\
  \ likeably humble. The Omo valley is mostly known for the Hamar and Mursi tribes,\
  \ but he explained that the Karo tribe were the strongest and most beautiful \u2013\
  \ distinguishing themselves by painting their faces and bodies with chalk, both\
  \ to attract the opposite sex and to instil fear in their neighbouring tribes people.\n\
  \ \nWe arrived and I felt myself transported to another land. Set atop a vast valley\
  \ I looked down at the Omo River meandering beneath us, the scattered straw huts,\
  \ and the men, women and children as they went about their day. The beauty of the\
  \ people struck me: tall, lean, muscular and bare-chested - the women decorated\
  \ in colourful beaded necklaces and metal bangles, the men with casually draped\
  \ rifles, carrying small wooden stools.\n \nThat night I fell asleep on my grass\
  \ mat underneath the expansive star-packed sky. I felt like the luckiest person\
  \ alive. I woke early, the sun not yet up, and listened to the sound of men chattering\
  \ quietly as the smell of coffee wafted through the air. Shoma apologised, he needed\
  \ to leave with the men for their daily 4am coffee ceremony to discuss current tribe\
  \ issues. He disappeared into the darkness and I was left alone to muse over what\
  \ beautiful customs they had and how incredible it was that their identity and traditions\
  \ were still prevalent and so strong.\n \nAll too soon it was time to say goodbye,\
  \ as I climbed up into the cabin of the water tanker I was hitching a ride on, I\
  \ looked across the horizon and saw dark clouds approaching - the first rains of\
  \ the season. I looked down at Shoma and the people of the Karo tribe, and as the\
  \ first heavy raindrops hit the dry African soil I knew it was these moments that\
  \ were why I travelled."
