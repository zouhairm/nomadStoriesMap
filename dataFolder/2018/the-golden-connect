Text: "It so happened that a good friend of mine, Shalini was going through a rough\
  \ phase in her life and wanted to do something \u201Ccrazy\u201D and so we booked\
  \ our train tickets and were off to visit the Golden Temple in true Indian style.\
  \ So, here we were at Mumbai Central station on a Thursday night and our 32 hours\
  \ journey to Amritsar began in the Golden Temple ML train departing from Mumbai\
  \ at 9:30pm.\n\nTwo young girls traveling alone on a train to Amritsar sounded quite\
  \ crazy to a lot which made us cautious but apart from some surprised eyes we didn\u2019\
  t find trouble. Different sets of people accompanied us, but the best of the lot\
  \ was a family traveling back home to Amritsar who gave us a complete low down on\
  \ the city and made our travel more meaningful. They touched upon the history and\
  \ significance of Amritsar city in the India Pakistan partition in 1947. And even\
  \ before the partition, the Jallianwala Baugh massacre, involving the killings of\
  \ hundreds of Indian civilians on the orders of a senior British military officer\
  \ without warning. They also asked us to must visit the Wagah Border ceremony, a\
  \ daily military practice of lowering the flags, followed by India and Pakistan\
  \ jointly at the border gate. Shalini inquired about the best cuisine and the lady\
  \ of the family promptly stated, chole bhature and lassi. She also insisted we have\
  \ the langar at Golden Temple which is simple but deliciously tasty and went on\
  \ to tell us about the kitchen which cooks and serves food for 50,000+ people each\
  \ day for free. It is run by volunteers some permanent and some temporary, even\
  \ for a few hours which is called seva. The young daughter emphasized on visiting\
  \ the Golden Temple in the evening too when it is all lit up and truly mesmerising.\n\
  With all this gained knowledge and information we knew a lot about the incredible\
  \ city Amritsar and our day in Amritsar was very fulfilling. We felt the vibrant\
  \ culture and holiness of the Sikhs while we walked the narrow lanes of the city.\
  \ Golden Temple was truly serene and definitely a must visit in the evening too.\
  \ But the highlight of this one-day trip for me was running with the Indian Flag\
  \ in my hands and dancing with the locals on the tunes of patriotic songs at the\
  \ Wagah Border ceremony. This was a moment of pride and immense happiness.\n\nWe\
  \ rushed to catch our train back to Mumbai, spending every second of our time to\
  \ imbibe in the Amritsari culture. And now I hope to meet a family everytime I travel\
  \ to get this perspective each time."
