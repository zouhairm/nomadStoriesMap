Text: "I remembered my time in the Beauvais airport after a short trip to Paris. There,\
  \ I met the man from Listowel. I did not know then. Yet, I soon learned he was an\
  \ angel. We met as we waited to board the plane to Shannon, Ireland. I explained\
  \ my ill-formed plans. I was young: a wanderer. As we chatted, I admitted to him\
  \ that I would be staying the night at the airport. In those days, I formed a sort\
  \ of reckless, shapeless bulge of a person. But it was my shapelessness that brought\
  \ me to the kind man and perhaps that same trusting nature was what made me trust\
  \ his offer as genuine and to accept the help that opened to me as the plane\u2019\
  s door opened and the man and I, who were both headed back to Ireland, met in the\
  \ waiting gate at Beuvais.\n\nUpon landing in Ireland, we passed through customs\
  \ and drove the silken rain-slicked road to his place of residents. The gate opened\
  \ when he pressed a button and we went inside. It was dark outside. I couldn\u2019\
  t see the landscape, but I was not scared. \u201CYou\u2019ll be able to see it better\
  \ in the morning,\u201D he said. \u201COut that window is the oldest racetrack in\
  \ Ireland.\u201D That night, as I fell into bed I counted the stars of luck and\
  \ kindness that had suffused this rough part of my life in a grandeur I knew nothing\
  \ about. I got a taste of plenty, where I had felt only absence. \n\nWhat I found\
  \ the next day upon waking, was the racetrack he mentioned the night before. It\
  \ was an image not quite of this world. The colors blurred together with the rain.\
  \ A small factory rose up with smoke filling the air and a river running below it.\n\
  \nThe sun was shining that day and after breakfast, the whole world stood waiting\
  \ on Irish time as I loaded the bus where the kind man had led me. It meant stopping\
  \ for a pint between stations, letting deadlines fly by, and taking in the scenery.\
  \ For me, the new philosophy of being a tourist meant none of the grievances of\
  \ the universe, including my own, mattered anymore. \n\nTo this day, I am still\
  \ alive (though my mother says you did what), and I have the rest of my life to\
  \ figure out what that means. But for now and forever imprinted on my mind, there\
  \ is the rolling countryside, the influence of green on my consciousness and the\
  \ kind man that opened to me the concept of abundance."
