Text: "The heat was unbearable. \n\nThere I sat, crammed in a wooden bench with 8\
  \ middle-aged Finns, sweat trickling down my face. The hot air seemed to loosen\
  \ the usually laconic Finns who conversed disregarding their treasured personal\
  \ space.\n\nI had come to this sauna in the shores of lake Lohja for one reason,\
  \ to experience the reconciliation of the extremes. Searching for a connection with\
  \ the dichotomy that forges the Finnish spirit in a concatenation of scalding heat\
  \ and chilling cold.\n\nA sizzle came from the stove as a cedar-scented wave of\
  \ heat thickened the air around me. Sweat drenched the whole of my body now, hot\
  \ air burning the inside of my nostrils, yet I sat there in deep thought, waiting,\
  \ stalling; knowing the moment approached but reluctant to make the move.\n\nMy\
  \ hesitation must have seemed apparent to the man who had greeted me for he spoke\
  \ to me in a thick Finnish accent, \u201CThe first time is always the hardest\u201D\
  - he said, staring at me with storm gray eyes, as he poured more water over the\
  \ hot rocks- \u201CIt\u2019s all about sisu\u201D; the rest of them nodded in agreement.\n\
  \nThe next heat wave sent me to my feet, and I walked towards the door. \n\nAt first,\
  \ I didn't feel the cold, a misty armor of residual heat protected me, trailing\
  \ behind me, as I walked the blue carpet towards the stairs at the end of the pier.\
  \ \nThe freezing night air seeped inside me with every step I took, my socks cracking\
  \ as they stuck to the frozen carpet. I felt a shiver down my spine when I stared\
  \ at the black hole contrasting against the white sheet of ice.\n\nGrabbing the\
  \ cold metal handle, I climbed down the steps. \u201CHey, this is not too bad,\u201D\
  \ I thought as my right foot entered the water; boy was I mistaken. When the frigid\
  \ water touched my chest, I gasped and inhaled violently, slipping into a sheer\
  \ cold void of a million pricking needles that slowly sapped the heat of my body.\
  \ Struggling to keep my head above the water, I moved my hands as fast as I could\
  \ while the numbness of my fingers extended towards my arms.\n\nSuddenly, as the\
  \ heat went to my core to protect itself from the cold, I saw it. My heart racing\
  \ to combat hypothermia showed me the relentless fight my body was willing to put\
  \ to survive obstacles, the strength of will it had against extreme circumstance.\
  \ And that extraordinary determination in the face of adversity showed me the meaning.\n\
  \nI finally understood\u2026 Sisu. \n\nThat moment of clarity gave me the strength\
  \ to climb up the stairs, thus beginning the cycle anew."
