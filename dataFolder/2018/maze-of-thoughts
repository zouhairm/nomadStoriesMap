Text: "\u2018Kalimera\u2019 Athens! \nI have a positive feeling about you, although\
  \ my friend and I  haven't planned where we are going to stay or what will see.\
  \ We even played rock, paper, scissors to decide how many days we will stay here.\
  \ However, according to Julio Cort\xE1zar, there are two types of people, some are\
  \ cronopios and others are famas and this time we were definitely cronopios. The\
  \ mantra of finding a roof over our heads was successful. The place we were going\
  \ to stay at was located in a neighbourhood that had the look of an open market,\
  \ where people compete to shout about the goods they are selling. Were we still\
  \ in Greece or maybe the plane landed somewhere else? This street we were going\
  \ to walk on few times a day was excitingly alive, loud oriental music was playing\
  \ from the barber shops and from the local d\xF6ners, middle-east people were examining\
  \ us carefully with their eyes but we were cronopios and didn't judge.\nWithout\
  \ having any expectations on this calm afternoon, we headed to the old part of the\
  \ city called Plaka. There the mysterious intertwining cobbled streets lead us to\
  \ the temple of Olympian Zeus, where taxi cars were parked in front of the entry.\
  \ One taxi driver came by and asked us in a 'wolf of wall street, convincing way'\
  \ if we would like to see Mount Lycabettus. Our answer was negative, then a second\
  \ driver came by, trying to market us the same service, still a no.  And there comes\
  \ the third one, approaching us with ''Hi, baby..''? My friend turned abruptly and\
  \ answered snappishly ''I am not your baby!'' Then the man explained cheerfully\
  \ that this is how he calls his daughter. Next thing I knew, we were in his taxi,\
  \ driving to the hill. \n''Lady, listen to me carefully. I am talking for your good.''\
  \ He would say to me, every time I was looking through the window. His stories varied\
  \ from history of Athens to life lessons to his son, who he claimed that is good-looking,\
  \ studies medicine and is single.  \n''I want you to remember my city'' Sotos added\
  \ after each story he told us. So we did! The Mount, he drove us to, offered the\
  \ most captivating view of the city while the mixture of golden and tangerine dragons\
  \ were covering the sky. I always get excited about sunsets, doesn't matter where\
  \ am I. Absorbed by the majesty of the brightest Olympic flame ever existed,  thousands\
  \ of questions just kept firing in me. I was lost for a moment in this maze of thoughts.\
  \ Who would expect that just one day in Greece will give me so much food for thought?"
