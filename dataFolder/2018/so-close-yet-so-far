Text: "The first thing I heard as I landed in Dublin Airport 'I think it's time for\
  \ a brandy!'.\n\nIt helped that my sister is half Irish, yet I'm kicking myself\
  \ how I left it till I was 33 to visit. \nIt's literally next door, and that's what\
  \ stopped me to explore?\n\nI sat by the Ryanair wing as my eyes rested out of the\
  \ window over the sea, so beautiful under the sun.\nOne boat, so tiny yet it it\
  \ left a beautiful trail of travel behind it, so graceful.\n\nAs we left the UK\
  \ behind us, we entered this world of beauty, so green. \n\nFinally touch down in\
  \ Ireland!!!\nWe missed the coach and had to wait an hour, one thing I loved is\
  \ how they spoke in this accent, just like the movies.\n\nAs we waited for the coach\
  \ charging by the pub, a fist landed between us on the table.\nI jumped, and saw\
  \ a guy, who seemed a bit drunk, wasn't sure what he wanted.\n'Rock, paper, scissors?'\n\
  Then we played, and laughed, with a complete stranger.\n\nI was in shock at how\
  \ friendly everyone was. \nEven more pleasantly surprised at the Irish world of\
  \ breathtaking mountains, and sea. \n\nHow is this all so close to me, yet I'm just\
  \ discovering?\n\nDriving through Ireland, it seemed like a nice city, went through\
  \ the bridge which was a large white harp.\nIt seemed relaxed, people were just\
  \ nice, no crowds, just a nice pace. \n\nStayed at Rochestown Hotel and Spa, still\
  \ trying to get my head round the niceness of people in this city.\nThe view from\
  \ the hotel window was impossible to capture, two mountains stood with pride in\
  \ the distance.\n\nEach day was filling more storage of memory, in my mind. \nI\
  \ felt the soul of this land, rich with history dating back to the 700's.\nEnjoyed\
  \ a guided tour in Dorkey castle, seeing Ireland from the top, and holding a crossbow\
  \ standing in one of the oldest buildings.\nEverything was different, the Oyster\
  \ is called 'Leap', the train is called the 'Dart', even the post box was green.\n\
  \nAnd as I sipped ice coffee, I noticed Keogh's....\nYep, shamrock flavoured crisps,\
  \ happiness comes in many forms, and I had just met Keogh.\n\nI liked how different\
  \ Ireland was, in spirit. \nKindness mixed with realness within it's people. \n\
  The lightheartedness, and sense of humour. \n\nI bought a Celtic Tree necklace,\
  \ for myself, with a green dot in the middle. \nI will always have a piece of Ireland\
  \ in my heart, and a reminder to be strong. \nWith my roots deep in the ground,\
  \ no matter how many leaves fall, I will always stand tall. \n\nWith love, Sally."
