Text: "It was 1975 and I had just left home for the first time in my whole life, my\
  \ purpose was to travel in a round trip from Europe to North america, just to make\
  \ myself assured of my capacities, but if you are reading this you might well know\
  \ by now that the trip didn't end like it was supposed to. This journey would take\
  \ me during a month to the less known places of Canada and USA, but I didn't make\
  \ it to USA, I just couldn't.\nAfter leaving my home town in Spain full of tears,\
  \ my heart, mind and soul were disposed for adventure, eager of new experiences,\
  \ and maybe that was the problem. I got to Quebec after a lovely 7h flight, my mind\
  \ was completely blurred and my only will was for a comfortable, soft, and warm\
  \ bed. But guess what? I arrived at my hotel at 9 a.m. and, as you may know, the\
  \ room is only available from 12 a.m. so I had two options, I could either wait\
  \ in the Hotel hall trying to die slowly, or I could go out there and find something\
  \ of what I was looking for: adverntures.\nSo I waited...just kidding, I went out\
  \ of the hotel ,after paying 10$ for luggage store, and I started to wander towards\
  \ what it seemed to be the city centre, and I say seemed and not were beacause I\
  \ had no map and Google wasn't there yet.  After half an hour I realised I had got\
  \ lost, no idea where I was neither how to come back to the hotel. I might appeared\
  \ to be desperate because in that exact moment I turned my back and saw an enourmous\
  \ man with a shiny smile that asked: can I help you? At first I got paralysed, but\
  \ after a while I could articulate some words, or something understandable at least,\
  \ he slap my back and told me to follow him. \nI walked and walked and no hotel\
  \ was at sight, this started to smell badly for me, we had left town some time a\
  \ go and don't ask me why, I was still following that stranger. In my moment of\
  \ deepest desperation in which I only could think in what ways this giant would\
  \ crush me, we got to a small settlement with a few tents that seemed amerindians\
  \ to me. Then my 'friend' introduced me to the chief that was called Me'krote, or\
  \ something that sound exactly like that, I was still unable of utter propper words,\
  \ my inner mixure of fright and admiration didn't give me a chance, not yet. He\
  \ started speaking in a perfect english, something I found completely confusing,\
  \ he explained me that I was in a Mi'kmaq settlement, one of the first inhabitants\
  \ of America, and everything I could say about that to him was: what did you say\
  \ about a Big mac?"
