Text: "I was just kicked out of university. I was 19 years old, living on my own,\
  \ wasn't socializing, depressed, overweight, and my grades suffered. Badly So I\
  \ moved back in with my parents and was working at the local factory trying to get\
  \ my head into some sort of space that resembled \"motivated young adult\". I was\
  \ young, restless, listless, and goalless. \n\nUntil one day when my family was\
  \ watching a documentary about these archaeologists uncovering a Roman shipyard\
  \ that had long been swallowed by the ocean. My father suggested I could find an\
  \ organization where I could work on an archaeological site for room and board.\
  \ So to the internet I went, and I found Projects Abroad, an organization that did\
  \ community work with locals by taking volunteers from all over the world. They\
  \ had two Archaeology projects: One in Romania working on Castle Dracula, and the\
  \ other in Peru. I mentioned this to my dad and he basically said \"Put your money\
  \ where your mouth is.\" That made me angry so I applied that night and had a goal\
  \ to work towards.\n\nMonths later I was at the airport waiting to board my flight.\
  \ I was excited and anxious. This was my first time traveling alone. My flights\
  \ from Calgary, Canada to Vancouver, Canada to Los Angeles, California were a snap.\
  \ It was after I landed in Lima, Peru that things went to hell. I was held up at\
  \ customs trying to find a pen to fill out my declaration, then I couldn't find\
  \ my luggage. I finally found it, went to check it again, found the correct line,\
  \ only to wait long enough to miss my flight. Before that trip I would've let my\
  \ emotions get the better of me and panicked. Someone would've eventually helped\
  \ me before, but now I was in a foreign country where English was not the main language.\
  \ I had to pick myself up by my bootstraps and take care of things myself.\n\nI\
  \ was booked on another flight to Cusco, Peru easy as pie. When I arrived in Cusco\
  \ I called the Projects Abroad office and told them I missed my original flight\
  \ but had finally arrived. After I was picked up, I had the most amazing time. I\
  \ saw a gorgeous country, ate amazing and exotic foods. Met so many fantastic people,\
  \ picked up an accent. Learned some Spanish, and about the culture and history of\
  \ Peru. Excavated archaeological sites deep in the mountains, saw Macchu Pichu and\
  \ other cultural sites.\n\nThree months later I looked like a different person.\
  \ I grew a beard, lost a ton of weight, and I had goals for my future. I had dreams.\
  \ It wasn't easy, but it was worth it."
