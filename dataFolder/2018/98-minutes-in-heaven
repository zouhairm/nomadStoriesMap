Text: "\"90 minutes and counting,\" my husband said from the plastic crate he had\
  \ flipped to make a stool. \"Pinterest-perfect vacation babe.\"\n\nHa. Ha. I chose\
  \ not to respond as I leaned back awkwardly into the cheap plastic chair I had claimed.\
  \ If I closed my eyes I could still pretend that this was the luxurious relaxation\
  \ I had been envisioning for months. The Santorini sun gently kissing my skin, a\
  \ soft Mediterranean breeze kicking up wisps of my hair, and a crystal-clear view\
  \ of the surrounding Aegean Cyclades. Anyone else would have given in and just enjoyed\
  \ the breathtaking hike to the little white church waiting atop the caldera. \n\n\
  That's not why I was here. \n\nI opened my eyes as footsteps crunched the red pumice\
  \ soil. A stout, weathered but smiling Greek man approached us, flicking a string\
  \ of Komboloi, or worry beads, in one hand. \n\n\"Lucky island, lucky day!\" he\
  \ exclaimed as he waddled right past us into the dilapidated shed we were posted\
  \ by.\n\nIs this who we had been waiting for? Before I could peer into the shed\
  \ to inquire after his services, the Greek man bustled out, this time carrying a\
  \ canister and two Dixie cups.  \n \n\"Lucky island, lucky day!\" he said again\
  \ as he shoved a cup into each of our hands, pouring a dark red liquid. \n\nI sipped\
  \ and then gulped what turned out to be a heavenly, almost syrup-thick sweet red\
  \ wine. Upon seeing our delight, the Greek man nodded and knocked back the rest\
  \ of the canister himself. He smiled and motioned for us to follow him. Abandoning\
  \ our makeshift waiting room furniture, my heart quickened as the Greek man opened\
  \ the gate of a corral adjacent to the shed. \n\nA drove of plump dusty donkeys,\
  \ each adorned with a shiny blue \"evil-eye\" talisman, was waiting patiently inside.\
  \   \n\nUsing only one hand, the Greek man groomed and tacked three donkeys as the\
  \ Komboloi were back out and flicking away in the other. I patted the plush nose\
  \ of my donkey and received a warm snort in response.\n\nAs we were lead up the\
  \ caldera in a single file strand, I hardly noticed the cloudless sky and talisman\
  \ blue ocean that merged into one vast expanse. Neither did I mind the volcanic\
  \ pebbles leaping off the sheer cliff we were skirting. I only felt the sinew of\
  \ the little gray donkey beneath me, mindlessly completing his daily task. \n\n\
  This is why we were here.  \n\nSuddenly we stopped, and I realized we had already\
  \ reached the top. Only an eight-minute ride. \n\nBefore my husband could smirk\
  \ back, I declared, \"It was worth every lucky minute.\""
