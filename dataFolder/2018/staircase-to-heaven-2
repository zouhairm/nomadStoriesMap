Text: "Hot!Even though there was\_a shade\_above me,sunlight bordering only the area,\
  \ warm and wet spotted floor beneath me,I was on fire.Or was it my nervousness,\
  \ which seemed to echo ablaze and frame thousands of\_heavyset feelings in my stomach.\n\
  Words hailed for the flume I had come to be, were \u2018wildest, Poseidon revenge\u2019\
  \ with a chamber where the ground would give away, rocketing you nearly vertical\
  \ to the bottom.That was Dubai, more than a mere tourist attraction.This deserted\
  \ land was unique\_through its\_urban-rural\_vibrant blend,vast expatriated people\
  \ abode in tranquil or with its icy indoors and hot outdoors.\n\u201CThe ride is\
  \ a thrilling experience\u201Delucidated a competent mate over dinner.\n\u201CIt\
  \ gets you_ um_\u201D\_ \n\u201CShaking\u201D offered a scared listener.\n\"Intimate\
  \ with your fear.\" He established shrewdly. \n\u201CYou give fear your undivided\
  \ attention, endure them, act against it & it gifts you with strength & courage.\u201D\
  \nUp on top, two inescapable pods loom uprightly.But the aura up there was reassuringly\
  \ sanguine.I had been greeted with cheeky smiles,knowing looks were shared,kindred\
  \ bond formed between a few of us who had dared to be tough as nail.One minute a\
  \ woman in the pod had horror written on her face,scream strangled by the casket.The\
  \ next second I was there getting my weight checked.\nSuddenly all my humor suffocated\
  \ I step in.The moment that trapdoor started getting shut,a strange voice radiates\
  \ from the core of mind somewhere between a cry and yells.It's an angry,vexed,the\
  \ sound of your brio mounting off nap and shouting \u201CYou don\u2019t want to\
  \ be here.Get out.\u201D I didn\u2019t care I had crossed 11 never ending flight\
  \ of stairs.Emotions raged within me so intense I could canvas my own face without\
  \ a mirror.The woman with whom I had been exchanging excited luck had terrified\
  \ wide eyes, just like mine were desperate.The instant I heard countdown my mind\
  \ went blank.My hearing intensified to a level that all I could sense was to hear\
  \ aqua gushing by & the numbers.\nWith a bang I flew in air at a speed so great\
  \ that as the water guzzled my face.Those 2 second felt forever,2 frozen seconds,which\
  \ left me in control of nothing.Soon after I felt the slide in my back again hurling\
  \ through the tube into a pool.Somewhere along the line, smiles\_had buzzed back\
  \ to my face.Although I don't know if it was due to relief or heady delight,I knew\
  \ this time it won\u2019t be wiped off."
