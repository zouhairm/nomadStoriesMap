Text: "Kenya is home to vast spaces that arouse, captivate and leave many in awe.It\
  \ is for this reason that the local tourism scene is coming alive with youth initiated\
  \ tourism companies that is encouraging the locals to tour their country. Hashtags\
  \ and slogans like \u2018#tembeakenya\u2019 and '#magicalkenya' cannot be amiss\
  \ in the social platforms.\nElijah and I lost a loved one in 2017.My grandma and\
  \ his mom passed on a week apart. I felt obliged to spend time and find out how\
  \ he is fairing on seven months later.Grieving can make you lose touch with the\
  \ world and hence I wanted to jump-start 2018 in a different tone and what a better\
  \ way than by dragging a friend for some adventure.\nA 16km drive from Nairobi\u2019\
  s busy street to our first stop at the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust, an institution\
  \ founded in 1977 and best known for their work in protecting, rescuing and rehabilitating\
  \ elephants and rhinos in Kenya, from illegal poaching.\nThe center is the only\
  \ place that you can come close, see and touch the elephants! How exciting can this\
  \ be! Our two hour excitement  was evident on our faces as we watched the calves\
  \ being fed, lay in the dust and enjoy a brush or touch from the human visitors.\
  \ \nOur adventurous spirit detoured us to StoniAthi Resort, 40km from Nairobi Town.The\
  \ Savannah ecosystem welcomed us on the dusty road towards the resort. Small and\
  \ dispersed acacia trees played hosts to group of giraffes, monkeys, Thomson gazelles,\
  \ ostrich and zebras that we came across our journey.Serenity and breath taking\
  \ views allowed us to stop and breathe in life as well as capture some memoirs!\
  \  \nThe view was simply breath taking upon getting to Stoni Athi Resort. Built\
  \ in a bare, dry and vast land, the owner managed to bring life and tranquillity\
  \ by greening the resort. Calmness surrounded us. We decided to take advantage of\
  \ their indoor games to get competitive as we awaited our meal to be prepared.\n\
  In the scorching heat of 32 degree, a beautiful blue water was calmly and beautifully\
  \ smiling at us. The appealing invite couldn\u2019t by-pass us hence we just got\
  \ creative with what we had and decided to enjoy some splash!\nIt is the little\
  \ things in life that makes me happy. I decided to do it differently from the usual\
  \ restaurant coffee dates. Surprise a friend and yourself by taking the scenic route.\n\
  Adventure is out there. Live like a local!"
