Text: "The echoes of our voices pinged and rolled over our heads as we hurled ourselves\
  \ down the side of the mountain. Drenched in mist and sweat we ducked and weaved\
  \ through the jungle, swinging on thick vines and wobbling our way over swollen\
  \ rivers. I was exhausted, disgusting and surrounded by my new family.\n\nHorribly\
  \ unprepared and (suitably hungover) we had arrived at the foot of the Black River\
  \ Gorges in Mauritius. With just a sausage sandwich in hand and a bottle of water\
  \ each, we were ready for the trek. Picking the quickest route and, unbeknownst\
  \ to us, the steepest climb to the summit we set off confidently as a group of six,\
  \ almost strangers, from six different nations. We would descend four hours later\
  \ deliciously exhausted and dangerously dehydrated as six friends united by one\
  \ island.\n\nAt the foot of the mountain, we hitched a ride back to town from a\
  \ passing pick-up truck. In the back of the truck, we sat, covered in mud and huddled\
  \ together for warmth, watching the fields of sugar cane glide lazily by. Heavy\
  \ clouds were descending on the island, sitting on the mountain tops and clinging\
  \ to the fields ominously as a dark reminder of the approaching cyclone.\n\nAs we\
  \ sat in the back of the truck, it started to rain. Huge warm drops of water etched\
  \ tiny rivulets down our mud-caked faces - slowly washing us clean. The smell of\
  \ the baked tarmac and sun-drenched sugar plantations filled the air and, as quickly\
  \ as the rain could rinse us, the passing buses - with their blaring music and decorated\
  \ windows - threw up thick sprays of dirt, covering us, once again, in layers of\
  \ grime. I marvelled, from my cramped uncomfortable spot on the floor, at how my\
  \ life had so suddenly been turned upside down by these incredible people and the\
  \ island I had already fallen completely in love with.  \n\nTwo weeks earlier I\
  \ was living in London. I worked in an office, I had a flat, a boyfriend... an idea\
  \ of what life was going to be. I\u2019d given it all up for somewhere I knew nothing\
  \ about. Before I arrived I wasn\u2019t even sure where Mauritius was! Now, two\
  \ weeks later, I had a flat, a family, a life - I even had a cat (something impossible\
  \ in my London life)! Wild, free and surrounded by my new friends I could not have\
  \ been happier. Surely, this is what life should be."
