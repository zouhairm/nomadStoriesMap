Text: "Her name was Pe-n-ty. At least, that\u2019s what she wrote on the label of\
  \ the cassette tape she gave me. I found her name peculiar, seeing as how it was\
  \ spelled in that exact way and it didn\u2019t sound very Japanese. It rhymed with\
  \ the word plenty.\n\nI was in Tokyo only for a weekend. I made my way to Harajuku\
  \ district to take portraits; I\u2019d read that on Sundays, it became a gathering\
  \ place for certain Japanese youth subcultures. The sparseness of the crowd that\
  \ greeted me when I got there was a disappointment. Sure, there was a scene of rockabillies\
  \ dancing to familiar old tunes not too far off in the distance by Yoyogi Park,\
  \ but where were all the people dressed in visual kei, lolita, and goth attire?\
  \ I guess I was a few years too late.\n\nIt was then that I noticed a delicately-framed\
  \ elderly woman with a perfectly arched back rummaging through her sack of possessions.\
  \ I\u2019m not sure why, but I felt compelled to talk to her. We tried having a\
  \ conversation, first unsuccessfully in my very broken Japanese, and then with my\
  \ equally-broken gestures. I sat down with her for a while and learned that she\
  \ didn\u2019t much like Americans (but she loved us Canadians). I wondered if her\
  \ sentiments stemmed from personal experience or were a byproduct of history.\n\n\
  I didn\u2019t have much on me that day, but I gave her \xA53000 and a long black\
  \ umbrella. It wasn\u2019t even raining, but I felt like I had to give her as much\
  \ as I could. In gratitude, she went through her sack again and pulled out a mysterious\
  \ cassette tape. After we said our goodbyes, I promised myself I\u2019d come back\
  \ the very next day with a bento lunch for her. I did, but I never saw her again.\
  \ It was heartbreaking.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until a few years later that I finally\
  \ got to play the tape Pe-n-ty had gifted me. It made for a strange listen: an erratic\
  \ spoken word piece with interspersed bits of singing and static silence. I realize\
  \ now as I write this nearly a decade later, that maybe we didn\u2019t need to meet\
  \ a second time and have a second conversation. Maybe we both said what needed to\
  \ be said, and that was plenty.\n\nIf my travels since then have taught me anything,\
  \ it\u2019s that you don\u2019t always need a mouth to truly speak to someone. Body\
  \ language and cadences in human emotion can do just as much talking. Polyglots\
  \ might disagree, but we are able to communicate our stories even in the absence\
  \ of a common tongue. All you need is a common ground to sit on for a moment, with\
  \ a stranger\u2014even a very mundane slab of Harajuku concrete will do."
