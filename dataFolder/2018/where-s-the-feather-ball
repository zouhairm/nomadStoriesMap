Text: "I'm wide awake. So typical. I've always been resistant to time zone changes.\
  \ It's 10 PM in Shanghai. All my classmates, except for my best friend, Derek, are\
  \ asleep. My body screams, \"It's 10 AM at home, you can't fall asleep.\" Derek\
  \ understands me.\n\nWe flip on an old, boxy TV in our dorm room. A news anchor\
  \ elaborates on a top story, but it means nothing to us. We don't understand any\
  \ Mandarin. We flip for some thing that can hold our interest. Wait! Are men playing\
  \ volleyball with their feet?\n\nI didn't necessarily see a ball. Men jostle their\
  \ feet sideways, knees bent up to their chest. They stick out their chest and then\
  \ they are back to some fancy footwork, a cross between dancing and soccer.\n\n\
  The camera zooms to the players . What is that? Were there feathers sticking out\
  \ of that ball? I never heard of this game before, neither has Derek. This, I decided,\
  \ will be my souvenir.\n\nTwo weeks later, it is down to the wire. I need to find\
  \ this feather ball. Derek and I go on a hunt, because I am all about uniqueness.\n\
  \nWe stop by a stall, run by an elderly lady. I circle the stand but see no feather\
  \ balls. The lady asks me a question; It probably goes like, \"Can I help you?\"\
  \ \n\nI crack my winning, awkward smile. What should I say? Luckily, I draw. I whip\
  \ out my notepad and pen, turn around and scribble away. I show my doodle of stick\
  \ figures, a net and a feather ball to her. She gives a eureka-look, and I am satisfied\
  \ with my masterpiece.\n\nShe tells me, Meiyou (\"No\"), but it doesn't end there.\
  \ She gently places her hand on my wrist; Derek and I trustingly follow her to another\
  \ street. We do a full stop in front of a toy stand. She points to the feather ball.\n\
  \nI smile. Xie Xie, I tell her. She must have thought I don't know how to play,\
  \ because she took one of the balls and kicks it. She extends her leg for one, two,\
  \ three kicks before the toy flies too far. I pick it up. \"Here, Derek!\" I throw\
  \ it to him and poor Derek chases after it.\n\nHe tries and gets five hops. The\
  \ shopkeeper gives Derek two thumbs up. \"Number One,\" she cheers in broken English.\
  \ Derek passes the ball to me, and of course, I miss. The lady smiles.\n\nI place\
  \ it back into my bag. Xie Xie again to her and I waved goodbye. She waves back\
  \ and I feel humanity work its magic. Two people from two different countries, two\
  \ generations, share a moment of joy. My best memory from China.\n\nBy the way,\
  \ the Chinese call this feather ball jianzi. It only takes me 7 years later to search\
  \ for the correct name."
