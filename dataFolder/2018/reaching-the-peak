Text: "Now, it seems that it took a lifetime for the thoughts, or, I have to say,\
  \ the ambitions of my heart to materialize. It may seem so, because this destination\
  \ has been placed in my heart for almost all my life.\nAs I progressed through the\
  \ years, I often found myself looking for texts or images, transporting a little\
  \ of myself into the true country of Italy. Well, at least in my mind, at that moment.\
  \ When I came back from these \"holidays\", my heart was more determined to find\
  \ a way to travel, in the country of Italy.\nBetween work shifts or even during\
  \ the lunch break while I was at work, I practiced my language skills. In this way,\
  \ when it was time for me to travel, I would be promptly prepared. Even in my family\
  \ life, the culture I would absorb from the images or texts that I had often studied\
  \ would influence my choices in cooking, music, movies, also, much more.\nAs it\
  \ happened, some events led me to take the work contract, which would have me move\
  \ through my country, in the mountains to take a position on the ski resort. The\
  \ nice thing about the contract was that it would allow me to accumulate the right\
  \ finances to finance my travels. The other side was that, the contract would be\
  \ for one season, with the possibility of continuing for another 3 years. Of course,\
  \ for my professional life, this was excellent, however for my heart, not so much.\
  \ When the work was to continue for all 3.5 years, travel plans would be delayed.\
  \ \nStarting employment at the resort was excellent, as it allowed me to open my\
  \ eyes to the fact that, when it was time for me to travel to Italy, I could explore\
  \ the ski resorts in the mountains of Italy.\nDuring the first few months in the\
  \ mountains, working at the resort, I attended a nearby class. The teacher, a local\
  \ in the city nearest to the resort, mentioned, during one of the lessons that they\
  \ would be organizing a trip, an artist\u2019s retreat, in Tuscany. Indeed, I was\
  \ glad to know about the trip!\nMy dear, I write this message to you now, while\
  \ I sit at a cozy restraunt, here in Tuscany, as I taste a delicious pizza, a bit\
  \ pasta with pesto sauce, then I will wash everything down with a bottle of red\
  \ wine. \nThe last thing I ever expected when taking the job at the ski resort was\
  \ meet someone, who would be able to help bring my travel plans to fruition.\nIn\
  \ retrospect, while writing this message, it is quite clear, where my heart was\
  \ set. \nWhen we finish here, we leave for the mountains of Italy!"
