Text: "Colourful prayer flags hang from electric poles that lead up to the inconspicuous\
  \ little town in my home state of Karnataka, deep in the south of India. The first\
  \ indication of something strange is the welcome sign which is written in English\
  \ and a wholly unfamiliar script in these parts, Tibetan.\n\nWhen I stepped into\
  \ Bylakuppe, a former Tibetan refugee settlement that has grown over the years into\
  \ a full-fledged town, I felt like I had entered subtropical Lhasa. I strolled past\
  \ colourful houses with brick tiled roofs as the aroma of freshly steamed momos\
  \ and spicy thukpa wafted in the air. Crimson robed monks rode serenely on motorbikes,\
  \ navigating the narrow streets as a group of children scampered past me with shorn\
  \ heads and grins on their faces. It was a little surreal to feel like a foreigner\
  \ in my own backyard but here, I didn't need a passport to explore this unique culture\
  \ that I had never known, or a visa to learn the story of such a resilient people.\
  \ \n\nI visited the monasteries where monks sat cross legged in front of gigantic\
  \ statues of the Buddha, reciting their prayers in a chorus, the sounds of their\
  \ bells and damarus echoing off the walls. The air was thick with the smell of incense\
  \ and burning fat from the butter lamps that dotted the prayer area, their flames\
  \ flickering quietly to the rhythmic chanting. I felt tranquil as I stepped out\
  \ of the monastery an hour later, momentarily surprised that I wasn't in the foothills\
  \ of the Himalayas. \n\nI stopped for lunch in a small restaurant and its owner\
  \ Tsering, a very amicable man, was the first local I met. Brimming with curiosity,\
  \ I asked him about Tibet. He only had hazy memories of being surrounded by cloud-kissed\
  \ mountains. Just when he turned five, he was taken away from his home country and\
  \ brought to mine. He then told me his story, of how he had grown up listening to\
  \ Buddhist prayers and Bollywood songs, how he felt like Bylakuppe was his home\
  \ but Tibet his homeland and how it felt like a constant tightrope walk to balance\
  \ both of these nationalities. He was unsure of when liberation would come and hoped\
  \ that it would be in his lifetime. \n\nAs I continued walking through town, I met\
  \ more of its kind and cheerful residents who chatted freely and laughed heartily.\
  \ It was only that evening, as I sat in my bus headed back home, that I realized\
  \ that even if we try to alter the lines drawn on maps, the spirit of a country\
  \ will never be erased as long as its people live on."
