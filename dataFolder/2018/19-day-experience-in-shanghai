Text: "The sky had its usual gray and cloudy appearance, the weather was a little\
  \ warm \u2013 very characteristic for that season of the year - and the ground announcing\
  \ that the night had been rainy. My breathing was mild; my eyes attentive to everything\
  \ around me and my steps harmonious, following the calmness of the movements of\
  \ the old ladies practicing tai chi chuan. Their melody balanced with the breeze\
  \ in the charming flowers and a few leaves that insisted on falling down from the\
  \ trees. \n\nThe amount of young students passing by, sometimes late for their first\
  \ class in the morning, increased naturally. However, neither them nor their typical\
  \ bicycles interfered the concentration and the awareness of each movement done\
  \ by those female bodies. That was an ordinary Chinese morning in the campus of\
  \ Shanghai University and from that time on, I was temporarily part of it.\n\nIn\
  \ the middle of an enormous city, full of vehicles of every kind, technology, subways\
  \ and hundreds of people moving everywhere all day long, there was a nice place\
  \ where everything could happen in slow motion and our thoughts could be placed\
  \ in their right position. Through those movements, I forced myself to stop and\
  \ analyze the experience I was offered to live; all the stereotypes once constructed\
  \ about that culture and people had been destroyed. All that contrasting reality\
  \ had caught my attention.\n\nShanghai was a 19-day-experience, which was worth\
  \ it tremendously. Every part visited of that enormous city seemed to have a distinct\
  \ soundtrack that still keeps sounding in my mind. Pictures, sounds and smellings\
  \ were sensations that addressed me to magical moments and feelings. \n\nI had a\
  \ strong experience with myself due to the connection I have created with that city.\
  \ I could live the rush hours that an urban city commonly has and the soft moments\
  \ of praying in a temple placed among high skyscrapers.  All these elements made\
  \ this trip outstanding and unforgettable. Once the bonds are created through our\
  \ affective memories, they are never broken, just reinforced."
