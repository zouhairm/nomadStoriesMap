Text: "Barrio do Centro, Rio de Janeiro. A skyline of contemporary skyscrapers merged\
  \ with the historic remains of colonial era buildings. Here, Brazil`s largest corporations\
  \ tower above long alleys spread like veins outside of the neighbourhood`s heart,\
  \ the Cinelandia square. Observe this warren of streets within the working day and\
  \ you`ll play the role of spectator to an area that is continually buzzing. An arena\
  \ of roads and pathways amass with overflow of commuter traffic. Where shouts of\
  \ street vendors accompany the faces of decrepit buildings - now a canvas for Rios\
  \ thriving artist community.\n \nYet, tonight, tourists and businessmen have long\
  \ since dispersed and traffic has thinned. Silhouettes of skyscrapers have become\
  \ engulfed by the night`s sky and replaced by dim lights of tiny bars in narrow\
  \ passageways. My gaze filtered, flickering and broken by the lashings of January`s\
  \ latest tropical storm, the backseat window of our 11pm Uber displays an image\
  \ reel of abandoned streets that perfectly personify Centro`s notoriarity for crime.\
  \ Despite my three month residence in Rio, a feeling of anxiety washes over me.\
  \ This downtown neighbourhood\u2019s reputation is not a fallacy.\n\nOur Uber ends\
  \ and moments later, hurried footsteps through puddles upon uneven pathways spread\
  \ long strings of filthy rainwater up the backs of our legs and fill the crevices\
  \ of our toes with grit. Yet our already soaken state is doing little to deter us,\
  \ because it is now that we hear the hum of activity waiting to greet us. We jostle\
  \ past a wall of clamouring street vendors and pause briefly to buy beer. \n\nPlumes\
  \ of smoke from barbecued meats and cigarettes combine with the smell of rainwater.\
  \ Energy tangible as snare drums vibrate the beat of the Carioca\u2019s samba through\
  \ our chests, we edge into a twirling crowd hosted in the tiny courtyard. The beginnings\
  \ of February`s carnival apparent as I notice handfuls of colourful costumes; each\
  \ an ode to Rio\u2019s vibrancy and diversity. As we tilt our chins upwards, tonight's\
  \ festivities are the main attraction for residents also, who dance from balconies\
  \ and become equally drenched as those beneath them. \n\nThe crowd erupts with cheers\
  \ and a deep craving to memorise the scene arises in me. Seemingly misplaced and\
  \ impossible to pre-empt, the last thing you would expect. Tonight I learn not to\
  \ be deterred, because taxi rides unstopped by red traffic lights and brisk walks\
  \ through ominous alleys can lead you to the best Samba you`ll see in your life."
