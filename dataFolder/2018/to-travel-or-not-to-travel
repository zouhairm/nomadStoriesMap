Text: "Heather would be the ONLY person who volunteered tot rave with me. She was\
  \ my flatmate and fellow Erasmus peer. She instructed me to go ahead and book all\
  \ of my flights and then to email her the links to each flight and she would then\
  \ purchase her flights as well. I did as I was instructed and purchased flights\
  \ to Venice, Paris, Barcelona, and Marrakech. And I sent Heather the information\
  \ for each flight so she could book her trips. I was so excited to finally be exploring\
  \ other parts of Europe and to have a comrade with me along the journey. Before\
  \ we knew it it was the week of our first trip, Venice. I had asked my Australian\
  \ flatmate Hannah all about Italy because she came to Europe 2 months prior to September\
  \ to back pack around the majority of the EU. She was a true trailblazer and she\
  \ had the insider info on practically every country. \n\nSo we were 3 days away\
  \ from embarking on the trip of a lifetime. I was steadily packing as the days progressed\
  \ because I didn't want another mess like the one I left in North Carolina before\
  \ almost missing my flight. I was stuck between two outfits and my birthday would\
  \ land during our trip so I wanted to wear something special. I went to Heathers\
  \ room to ask for her opinion when she dropped a BOMB on me! Little did I know Heather\
  \ was not going to Venice, Barcelona, or any other place with me for that matter.\
  \ She informed me then that she apparently had too much of a workload and couldn't\
  \ afford to accompany me any longer. Distraught and disappointed I Whatsapped (International\
  \ Texting) Hannah to tell her of the news. The funny thing is that Hannah had actually\
  \ guessed hat something of this magnitude was going to happen. That Heather was\
  \ going to ditch me at the last minute. And she was RIGHT! She did! I was lost and\
  \ without hope when Hannah said \"you should go anyways, go by yourself!\" Hannah\
  \ was a pioneer. She was a trailblazer so she had the balls to do such a thing.\
  \ I on the otherhand wasn't quite sure if I possessed the courage to master such\
  \ a feat. PLUS! who would take my pictures if I went alone? \n\nAfter twenty minutes\
  \ of arguing Hannah convinced me to go alone and not to let my experience go to\
  \ waste. And I did just that. I ventured to Italy and had the experience of a lifetime.\
  \ And every country I visited thereafter I fell in love with. I became independent,\
  \ brave, and strong. I did what I LEAST expected to do. I traveled ALONE. And I\
  \ loved it! In fact, I loved it so much I do it literally every year now!"
