Text: "Nearly two years ago, my boyfriend and I decided to have the most adventurous\
  \ travel in our life. We left for Scotland or, better to say, for the Highlands.\
  \ The amazing side of the trip was that we had no idea of the route we would follow\
  \ and we hadn't booked a single hotel. \nSo, one of those day we were wandering\
  \ in the countryside near Ullapool, seeking an accomodation. We found this small\
  \ ruined hotel with a solitary appearance. We didn't like it, but the sun was about\
  \ to set, so we stopped there.\nSurely we were the youngest guest: we were literally\
  \ surrounded by lame old men and women wearing thick glasses and felted sweater.\
  \ Not so thrilling. We made a walk in the village, looking for young, healthy people\
  \ to talk to, but it was like looking for water in the desert. The only hope we\
  \ had was a sign indicating a pub, \"The drunken boots\", with an arrow pointing\
  \ towards the forest. \nAfter dinner, we were undecided about what to do: did it\
  \ make sense to go out in the cold evening, to venture into the dark forest to visit\
  \ the pub? It might be another retirement home like the one we were staying in.\
  \ \nHowever, trying didn't cost anything (except, maybe, for the fear of entering\
  \ a forest without any single light). We took the car and bravely went through the\
  \ trees. At both sides, we could see unrecognizable shadows walking in the dark:\
  \ they were all going to \"The boots\". When we finally arrived there, we were astonished:\
  \ we've found the young! They were all sitting in groups, drinking beer and speaking\
  \ aloud. It was fantastic to see people under 30! \nWe took a seat at a crowded\
  \ wood table and tried a conversation. But suddendly there was another surprise:\
  \ a group of bagpipe players approached the stage and started playing. The girls\
  \ in the group danced typical Scottish dances. Everybody in the pub knew the songs\
  \ and incited the players: it was incredible and extremely fun! \nHowever, in a\
  \ few minutes the music became a fuss and we went out to have a moment of peace.\
  \ To be in the forest, during a night without stars, surrounded by mountains (that\
  \ we couldn't see, it was pitch black!) and in perfect silence... have you ever\
  \ experienced this? It was amazing. Suddendly we were woke up by a strange noise:\
  \ a bagpipe was being played in the dark. We squinted: almost totally hidden in\
  \ the darkness, there was a 14-15 year-old boy, wearing a t-shirt. Regardless of\
  \ the cold, he seemed concentrated and satisfied: he was playing in the night, paying\
  \ his respects to nature."
