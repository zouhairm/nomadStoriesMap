Text: "Medell\xEDn's Comuna 13 is a place that bombards the senses and emotions. It\
  \ was an experience that evoked feelings of sadness, as well as joy and inspiration.\
  \ It is difficult to grasp the immensity of the tragedy that has occurred in Comuna\
  \ 13 during a past that seems, in many ways, distant, but also so recent. Once considered\
  \ to be perhaps the most dangerous neighbourhood in the world, Comuna 13 has experienced\
  \ a remarkable revitalization. \n \nI was seeking to make a local connection in\
  \ this vibrant Colombian city, and was drawn to visiting Medell\xEDn because I wanted\
  \ to interact with locals and understand more about their city. I had the wonderful\
  \ opportunity to go on a guided tour of Comuna 13 through a local tour guide. I\
  \ was immediately awe-struck by his poise, and the way he captivated me when he\
  \ spoke. It connected me with the essence of the neighborhood on a deeper level\
  \ than I had imagined. The past history of Comuna 13 is, perhaps, emblematic of\
  \ a not-so-distant troubled chapter of Colombia\u2019s history. He provided a narrative\
  \ of the violent and sad history of Comuna 13, such as how guerilla groups and the\
  \ Colombian military squared off in gun battles, just fifteen years before. Hearing\
  \ this from the perspective of someone who lived through it, added an intensely\
  \ humanizing aspect of the tour. Despite the turbulent past, he assured me that\
  \ the only danger I would face would be running out of space on my SD card. \n \n\
  Despite its troubled past, Comuna 13 is also emblematic of Colombia\u2019s astonishing\
  \ transformation into the beautiful, friendly and progressive nation it is today.\
  \ I witnessed a breakdancing competition, and children playing in the streets, rather\
  \ than having to constantly be on alert for stray bullets from gun battles, as was\
  \ the case in the past. There is even a giant slip n\u2019 slide, which I took full\
  \ advantage of. \n \nI was inspired on a profound level by the street art, which\
  \ can be seen all over Comuna 13. It is something that\u2019s used to depict the\
  \ tragedy connected with the past, as well as the recent transformation, and hope\
  \ for the future. It blends those three forces together beautifully. \nI have never\
  \ seen a neighborhood brimming with as much life, and unbridled love of life, as\
  \ Comuna 13."
