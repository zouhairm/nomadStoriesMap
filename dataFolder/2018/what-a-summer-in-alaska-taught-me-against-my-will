Text: "When my season in Alaska began, I feared the cold, my minimum wage and sharing\
  \ employee housing with people who were probably going to be weird. But I was confident\
  \ I\u2019d write each day, laugh smugly at small-town life and ultimately, be exploring\
  \ the wilderness like that Into The Wild guy.\n\nIn hindsight, it's obvious I have\
  \ no idea what I'm talking about. \n\nFirstly, I should've packed shorts as there\u2019\
  s a significant amount of heat and sunshine involved in an Alaskan summer. And I\
  \ took to small-town living immediately, aided by a disconnect with the 'real\u2019\
  \ world thanks to no tv, limited cell reception and internet speeds that rivalled\
  \ dial-up circa 1998. I wouldn't see fast food or an airplane for months, the local\
  \ movie theatre showed one movie a week and the train came into town just once a\
  \ day. And I had no idea I\u2019d wake to views of glaciers and mountains, whose\
  \ colours changed from snow-covered white, to moss green and then autumn reds.\n\
  \nI failed to anticipate the fascinating characters I\u2019d meet. Like driver Buddy\
  \ and his incoherent stories and Champ, the omnipresent deckhand who wore only high-waisted-pants.\
  \ There were the locals, who not\_only\_have to indulge an invasion of tourists\
  \ and seasonal workers, but have to stick around for the horrible winter that always\
  \ comes next. And who, despite this, willingly share their town with anyone whose\
  \ interest is sincere. And my fellow 'Fairweather Alaskans', who arrive with the\
  \ warmth for work, adventure, escape and a challenge. All were so different and\
  \ yet they shared a trait I greatly respect\_\u2013 a desire to experience\_life\
  \ differently, combined with the rare courage to go out and do it.  For 3 months,\
  \ we hiked, biked,\_worked,\_slept, explored, drank and breathed Alaska. Unlike\
  \ the\_fjords and glaciers around us, however,\_our existence there was brief and\
  \ insignificant.\n\nHere is a place that unassumingly reveals the strength of nature\
  \ and the fragility of human life.\_Any control you think you have here is an illusion.\
  \ You and your livelihood are at the mercy of your environment; the animals, the\
  \ cold, the wind, the sea, the sun. And rather than scare you, this understanding\
  \ fills you with motivation to get out and do more.\_\n\nWith luck, there\u2019\
  s a handful of experiences that will positively change who you are or, equally as\
  \ importantly, who you thought you were and what you were capable of. For me, Alaska\
  \ was one of those experiences. \n\nOf course, there\u2019s an excellent chance\
  \ I have no idea what I'm talking about."
