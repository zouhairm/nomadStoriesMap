Text: "\u201COne day you are dodging traffic, and the next you are picking Rambutan,\
  \ Lychee, and singing to Krishna,\u201D Ralph patted me on my back and walked away.\
  \ I did a slow turn taking in the little plot of Hawaii while peeling off the alligator-like\
  \ skin of the lychee and popping it into my mouth. I thought about his comment,\
  \ and still do. \n\nPrior to Hawaii, I obsessively followed a girl and her travels\
  \ around the U.S. There was a day when she was addressed on Tumble by another follower\
  \ saying she was lucky to be able to travel. She replied, \u201CI gave up everything\
  \ else to make travel happen, and you can too. It\u2019s a matter of what your priorities\
  \ are. Is traveling your number one priority? What\u2019s keeping you from traveling?\
  \ Whatever is keeping you is probably higher on your priority list.\u201D She was\
  \ right.\n\nI\u2019ve almost always known what I wanted in any given situation.\
  \ But here I was compromising myself every day for those around me, to follow a\
  \ path that wasn\u2019t mine. I was telling myself what I wanted, but never acting\
  \ towards it. So when I heard about WWOOFing, I immediately bought my membership.\n\
  \nHours were spent perusing the farm catalogue and reaching out to potential hosts.\
  \ Finally, I discovered Aloha Farms. A farm a part of a Hare Krishna community on\
  \ Big Island, run by a devotee named Ralph. Warned about their daily practice, and\
  \ asked to experience it like a student exchange program, I committed. After all,\
  \ being raised Christian in Pennsylvania meant I only knew god and agnosticism.\
  \ What the hell was a Hare Krishna? \n\nAloha Farms informed me of Krishna, the\
  \ history, and the art of yoga. Not Asana but Bhakti - the yoga of loving devotion.\
  \ How to develop a personal relationship with god through way of your heart. I was\
  \ apprehensive due to the environment of the Christian Community I had been jaded\
  \ from.\n\nIn that space it was revealed that devotion isn't only about praying,\
  \ it\u2019s elevating the community and being of service in the only way you can.\
  \ Through helping at the elder home, tending to the farm, selling the food at the\
  \ market, gathering with neighboring farms to have Kirtan and share meals, I began\
  \ to understand. \n\nEchoes of this trip still ripple in my life today telling me\
  \ - be a tool in the big project that is our existence. Don\u2019t fall into line\
  \ with achieving societal deemed success. Instead, use what you have and contribute\
  \ to those around you. It doesn\u2019t have to be a grand gesture, just sharing\
  \ food will do. Or, when in doubt, sing to Krishna."
