Text: "'My name is Nomonde Siyaka. But please call me Mama. Welcome to my home.'\n\
  \nWe had arrived at Mzansi's by taxi, fearful of leaving our car in the township.\
  \ Langa may be within sight of Cape Town, but it is a different world.\n\nWe sat\
  \ on a long communal table, chatting with other guests from Poland, France and Brazil,\
  \ and listening to Mama explain how the evening would play out.\n\n'I am Xhosa\u2019\
  , Nomonde said, challenging us to mimic her native clicking sound, coming from somewhere\
  \ deep in the throat. 'Please, help yourself to the buffet and enjoy the music.\
  \ Then I will tell you a story.'\n\nThe traditional food was laid out on another\
  \ long table, set against a wall painted a vibrant shade of cerise, clashing unashamedly\
  \ with mustard yellow pillars from walls removed to enlarge the restaurant, as word\
  \ had spread.\n\nMama\u2019s husband Ace had brought dish after dish from the kitchen:\
  \ chakalaka salad, broccoli and cranberries, \u2018Mama\u2019s coleslaw\u2019, isiXhosa\
  \ beef stew, umngqusho (curry-flavoured samp and beans), a tray of rainbow-coloured\
  \ roasted root vegetables, grilled chicken drumsticks dusted with paprika, and some\
  \ crispy aromatic potatoes.\n\nAs we gorged on the authentic Xhosa food, the youthful\
  \ Marimba band assailed another sense. Three marimbas \u2013 wooden xylophones with\
  \ Bantu origins \u2013 created the core of the distinctly African jazzy rhythms,\
  \ supplemented by a drummer, a hyperactive percussionist and a cool, older saxophonist,\
  \ a straw hat perched on his sweating forehead. \n\n\u2018I moved back here, to\
  \ 45 Harlem Street, to care for my sick mother.\u2019 Nomonde had begun her story.\
  \ \u2018We ran a jazz club here for 8 years.\u2019\nWe were still eating, but everyone\
  \ was enthralled by what this charming, humble lady was telling us. \n\n\u2018My\
  \ mother saw more and more cars passing by Langa, on their way from the airport\
  \ to the city, and thought we should start a restaurant for tourists. We opened\
  \ up as Mzansi\u2019s in 2008. But we almost had to close in 2015, as people were\
  \ afraid to visit the township.\u2019\n\nI looked around at the other guests and\
  \ wondered who else, like us, had been worried about safety.\n\n\u2018But one day\
  \ some exchange students launched a marketing campaign for us, and now we are the\
  \ number one restaurant in the whole of Cape Town on TripAdvisor. And we provide\
  \ a living for all the musicians you heard tonight, the neighbours who help in the\
  \ kitchen, the people who grow the vegetables, the security guys who are looking\
  \ after your cars.\u2019\n\nMy eyes were glistening. This was the real Cape Town."
