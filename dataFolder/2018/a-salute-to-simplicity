Text: "When one envisions California, one sees the opulent estates of Hollywood A-listers,\
  \ the sweeping vineyards oozing splendor, the swank excursionist basking in the\
  \ boundless South Pacific rays. A global entertainment hub saturated with newest\
  \ wrinkle trends and sun-kissed cornucopia, California attracts people from the\
  \ world\u2019s deepest corners. Antithetical to the hackneyed tourist chronicles\
  \ of the Californian lifestyle, I absorbed the state through the coalesced community\
  \ of Ocean Beach, San Diego. \n     Cruising down Highway 1 in a 2008 Jeep Compass,\
  \ the sweltering heat dwindled in the breeze and my eyes drew towards the peachy\
  \ sky fusing with the opaque ocean blues. We entered a modest beach town where faddish\
  \ franchises were fictional and the largest shopping center was a red-roofed corner\
  \ store with seashell wind chimes in the window. We parked outside the single bedroom\
  \ abode bedecked with vines as the effulgent southwestern sun lowered in the baby\
  \ blue sky. \n     The town whispered as the sun set, the refreshing night air evaporated\
  \ the subtle drops of sweat on our palms as we interlocked hands and strolled toward\
  \ the cliff overlooking the ocean. There, sitting on lofty waterlogged rocks, was\
  \ a crowd of thirty people eulogizing nature\u2019s canvas as the ocean swallowed\
  \ the day\u2019s light. A frore Corona in hand, the community summoned on a Sunday\
  \ evening to kiss the week goodbye, a salute to simplicity. \nIsolated from the\
  \ exorbitant tumult of the city, Ocean Beach insufflated serenity and euphoria.\
  \ In a world strained with bureaucracy and antagonism, the people of Ocean Beach\
  \ seized unity and communal loyalty. The brackish ocean mist sprinkled across the\
  \ waking town as a cool morning breeze whispered through the parallel folksy dwellings.\
  \ Monday was market day. Locals arranged a street-side market offering homegrown\
  \ groceries and products to fellow community members. The concrete was festooned\
  \ with an array of fruits that matched the colours of the California sunset. The\
  \ morning breeze harmonized with the earnest chatter amongst neighbors as ataraxia\
  \ and exuberance in the purest form emanated from the damp concrete. \n     My sun\
  \ dyed chestnut locks loosely framed my freckled face as I nibbled on a ruby red\
  \ apple and gaped at the scopious stretch of sand merging with the white ocean froth\
  \ on the shoreline. Ocean Beach was not merely a pit-stop on the road to Beverly\
  \ Hills, it was the heart of affinity with the a burning sensation of belonging."
