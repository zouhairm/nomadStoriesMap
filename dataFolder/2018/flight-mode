Text: "Last Summer I planned Grand-Trip for our customers from Russia to Alsace. I\
  \ went to bed and woke up thinking about this trip. I remember all wine farms in\
  \ that region by heart.\n\nAnd all was complete Customers have already flight to\
  \ Stuttgart, where they had bus for transfer. And I with clear heart go to Airport\
  \ too. I was going to fly to Vienna to my \"lieber Freund\". I hade inspirationally\
  \ mood. Ah!\n\nBut already on the pass control something went wrong. Customers called\
  \ back and said that they hade troubles with transfer. Could you image what thought\
  \ local border guard (Board Germany-France), when he has found on his Board bus\
  \ with Holland numbers, Polish driver and Russian group inside? Crazy unbelievable\
  \ mix.\n\nIn that moment I understood that I had only few minutes to do something,\
  \ because bus already got me to plane, i went upstairs to cabine and heard \"Please\
  \ off your mobile devices for the duration of the flight\". 3 hours without connection,\
  \ face to face with my thinks. When i checked my Handy to flight mode, I felt, that\
  \ decision to choose that Bus company pushed to the edge. That flight seemed endless.\n\
  \nAnd it was really edge. But when you reach edge of one field - you get to start\
  \ edge of another field. I quit my job. So how I got a month-project in the Airport.\
  \ I literally lived there. I watched so many people, who arrived and departured,\
  \ met and saw off, was happy and upset. Too much different people from many countries\
  \ with their different emotions. My project was connected with supported of foreign\
  \ participants of Big Festival in Sochi. Many young people came from all of the\
  \ world to take a part in this festival. They made changing in Moscow and we should\
  \ support them by information and any other questions. That month i got so many\
  \ friend, helped so much people when they delayed to their Flights, lost their baggage\
  \ and had not enough money to get to another city. There found so many creative\
  \ solutions. We could find a common language with people from Mozambique even that\
  \ they spoke only Portuguese and we spoke only Russian, English and German. I saw\
  \ twinkle in the people's eyes. It's priceless feeling!\nSince that moment I understood\
  \ that want to make people happy and they believe that all will be good and have\
  \ the same twinkle in their eyes.\n\nThat is my story, how one decision that pushed\
  \ me to the edge and changed my life drastically to the better way. \n\nDon't afraid\
  \ to do wrong decision. Main that it makes you and people around happy."
