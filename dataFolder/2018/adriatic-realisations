Text: "From afar, the Dinaric Alps look like an immense and untamed body of water\
  \ set to stone, breaking on the shore, transposing the laws of nature. The land\
  \ and sea become one, creating an\_uneasy\_feeling of something that pulls you in\
  \ despite the fact you cannot really understand it.\nI was still trying to absorb\
  \ the scenery when I stepped off the bus. The hot and stuffy day had me broken down.\
  \ I was mad. My idea was to spend time in Split\_but my plans had not worked out.\_\
  Finally, I received a message from Mijo, a Croatian living in Ploce, that said I\
  \ could stay with him. A day later there I was. \n\nBus stations, you can visit\
  \ as many as you like across the globe, they always seem stuck in a particular time\
  \ and place in history. This particular one looked like a kitsch version of the\
  \ snack bar in Pulp Fiction. I was contemplating the existence of a Croatian Mia\
  \ Wallace when a car pulled up, and out stepped a cheerful half-giant of a man.\_\
  On our way to his house we started talking.\n\nDuring my stay, Mijo would drive\
  \ me around to his favourite places, with a childlike curiosity for my culture and\
  \ a guileless admiration for his own. We visited the walls of Ston, Mali Ston and\
  \ Crveno Jezero. I ate some of the best oysters I have ever had in a shed by the\
  \ side of the road owned by a lady with a fat cat named Mickey. I was in awe of\
  \ this newfound Croatia so perfectly curated by Mijo. Away from the knickknacks,\
  \ raves and alcohol, he talked about the things that surrounded me, making me understand\
  \ what I had been witnessing for the past few weeks.\n\nOverlooking the harbour\
  \ one night, he talked about the war.\nUntil then I had only met the youngest generation,\
  \ and they wanted to live in a modern dizzy whirl. Mijo talked openly about the\
  \ conflict. He said he did not really realise it was happening at the time but the\
  \ softness of his voice overpowered his usual thundering laughter as he talked.\n\
  What lingered with him were the sleepless nights when he would wake to the sound\
  \ of sirens and was dragged to the basement for shelter. As a pre-teen everything\
  \ about it bored him. He was not afraid of anything. Then, his lack of maturity\
  \ protected him from trauma and his unconcern shielded him from tears. Age brought\
  \ him the clarity and understanding to lower his voice, showing the respect that\
  \ he did not have then.\n\nAs we made our way back through the streets I saw a country\
  \ trying to reinvent itself while healing. The complete painting was not only beautiful,\
  \ it had become profound."
