Text: "\u201CSo you really visited 11 countries in 20days?\u201D she asked, looking\
  \ quite surprised. \u201CYes\u201D, said I with an air of accomplishment about me,\
  \ \u201Calthough if we chose to be specific about it, it is actually more like 21\
  \ cities across 12 countries in 21 days.\u201D She stared at me in disbelief. \"\
  Now, let me tell you about some of the stories I heard from the localities during\
  \ my trip.\"\n\nThe Lion Monument, Lucerne, Switzerland: \nThe Lion monument in\
  \ the city of Lucerne, Switzerland, is one of the saddest monuments you will come\
  \ across. It shows a lion dying in his cave, stabbed with a dagger on the back,\
  \ with the Swiss flag beside it and a French flag underneath his arm. This monument\
  \ was built to honor the 1000 Swiss soldiers called forth by the French king Louis\
  \ XVI to protect the royal family during the French revolution. But when the soldiers\
  \ surrounded the palace and was ready to battle the oncoming revolutionaries, the\
  \ king gave the order that the soldiers were not to kill any of the French people,\
  \ as they were his subjects. As a result, the soldiers were brutally massacred by\
  \ the rebels. This lion is a representation the mercenaries laying down their lives\
  \ for their king. \nBut that is not the entire story!! This monument was hewn by\
  \ Lukas Ahorn. Before Ahorn started work on the monument, he was promised a certain\
  \ sum of money by the Swiss government. But after he finished it, the Swiss government\
  \ refused to pay the balance amount. As an act of revenge, Ahorn designed the cave\
  \ of the lion to reflect the silhouette of a pig!\n\nThe wooden shoes of Netherlands:\
  \ \nIn olden times, most of the working class people in Netherlands worked in damp\
  \ and half-submerged conditions. This made their expensive leather shoes go bad\
  \ quite easily. So they used wooden shoes instead. These wooden shoes became so\
  \ popular that it is now a part of their cultural heritage. When a boy wants to\
  \ ask a girl to marry her, he handcrafts a pair of fine wooden shoes for her and\
  \ leaves it outside her door at night. If the shoes are taken into the house by\
  \ morning, it means the proposal has been accepted. If they are left outside instead,\
  \ it has been rejected. Even today, the Dutch people get married in these wooden\
  \ shoes. \n\nEven though I traveled through many countries in Europe, I barely had\
  \ to take out my passport anywhere, except for the port of entry and exit. They\
  \ live in perfect harmony. Not that these countries don\u2019t have problems, but\
  \ overall they are safe and confident of the open borders."
