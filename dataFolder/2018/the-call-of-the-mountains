Text: "March 2014. \nMy heart flutters with trepidation and excitement. I am harnessed,\
  \ my helmet tightened as the instructor tells me to step back and walk down the\
  \ cliff. Two steps . . . . twelve steps and I'm feeling more confident. Suddenly,\
  \ there's a jerk and I look down; just in time to see my carabiner snap open. I'm\
  \ falling. The screams are flying past my lips as unharnessed as I am at that moment.\
  \ \nWhen you're 15 and hurtling to your death, a lot of things are put into perspective.\
  \ For instance, I decided camping was not for me. I had never been sporty or adventurous,\
  \ so adventure sports were out of the question and should I live, I would never\
  \ rappel again.  \n\nFast forward to March 2016. \nIt's our last high school trip\
  \ and we are en route to Bhilar, a small village 7 kms away from the popular hill\
  \ station Panchgani. On day-two we hike up 1.5 kms to a small plateau and it's all\
  \ fun and games till the harnesses come out and our instructor tells us we are going\
  \ to rappel down a 420-metre cliff. My mouth goes dry and my knees shake. I walk\
  \ up to the camp director and say, \"I'm not doing this. I am terrified of rappelling!\"\
  \ \nHe says, \"Well, you have to make a decision here and now. Are you going to\
  \ control your fear, or will you let it control you?\" \nThen before I had a chance\
  \ to argue, he harnessed me to the anchor and handed me the belay line, saying \"\
  If you let go, one of your friends can fall. It's all in your hands.\" \nFear has\
  \ a funny way of manifesting itself into determination. The minute the belay rope\
  \ was in my hands, metaphorically so were my friends' lives. I didn't have the time\
  \ to be scared. I locked the carabiner around their rappel lines, over and over,\
  \ my hands sure and steady, and made sure they got to the bottom safely. \nThe camp\
  \ director watched proudly and asked if I was scared anymore and I was shocked to\
  \ find I still was. But it was okay. Still running on that adrenaline rush, I rappelled\
  \ down the cliff, face-forward. \nLater, I also signed up for a certified course\
  \ in mountaineering and basic adventure sports.\n\nMarch 2018, and I have instructed\
  \ four Himalayan camps, belayed 154 people and rappelled down every mountain range\
  \ in India except the Greater Himalayas. Yet, I choke every time because the hardest\
  \ decision you're ever going to make is stepping off the edge and if you aren't\
  \ living life on the edge, you're taking up far too much space."
