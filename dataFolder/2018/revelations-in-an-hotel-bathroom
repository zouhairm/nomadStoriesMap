Text: "I can still remember every detail of that bathroom. And the hotel, as well:\
  \ a great building, once passed the Sublicio Bridge, in Rome.\nThe Eternal City.\
  \ Where everything seems to glow in its own golden light. But I, I couldn\u2019\
  t help but feeling the most miserable human being in the world.\nWe were talking\
  \ about the bathroom. The tiles on the walls were a deep ocean blue. That blue so\
  \ dark that when you see it, out on a cruise, you feel frightened in front of the\
  \ magnificence of the sea.\nThe furniture were ceramic white, to impress you with\
  \ their cleanness. \nOn my left, the shower. I hate curtains on hotel showers. When\
  \ you are wet they stuck on you like dreadful jellyfishes and you are forced to\
  \ imagine all the other guests that have touched that place before you in a not-requested\
  \ sensation of intimacy.\nI remember that the glass, above the washbasin, was slightly\
  \ broken. Some splinters were missing revealing an underneath black surface.\nAs\
  \ in real life. There is always a black surface.\nMy splinters were already missing,\
  \ my black surface more evident day after day.\nSeven years in a nine and more working\
  \ hours per day company. Every extra duty, extra minutes spent there were a useless\
  \ weight on my shoulders. Where the hell was I going? My imagination: drained. My\
  \ will to create: disappeared. Under days and days of emails, phone calls, numbers.\
  \ Meaningless numbers.\nI was watching myself on that mirror. My dark brown eyes\
  \ marked by even darker circles.\nThen, sudden as a summer storm, the decision:\n\
  I will leave the job and go to live in London for few months.\nAs soon as that sentence\
  \ came out, multiple feelings attacked me.\nExcitement, pure and uncontrolled.\n\
  Fear, then. Fierce and primitive.\nAm I really going to quit my stable and well-paid\
  \ work to chase a dream?\nBut the truth of that sentence was  so powerful that it\
  \ was impossible to deny it.\nI grabbed my phone. There was only one way to understand\
  \ if I was right.\n\u201CHoney, I got a thing to say.\u201D\nI repeated him my idea,\
  \ but I was losing confidence. Social structures, that wanted me to be a good worker,\
  \ not a dreamer, and in a couple of years a perfect mother, arrived to tease me.\n\
  He answered, in his calm voice: \u201CI think it\u2019s wonderful.\u201D\n\nToday,\
  \ I used a free sample of bath foam taken from that hotel and I suddenly felt sad.\
  \ The smell of lavender dragged me again to that place, that time.\n I shake my\
  \ head, to remove that feeling.\n Outside the window, it is sunny.\n And I have\
  \ already planned to visit the Globe."
