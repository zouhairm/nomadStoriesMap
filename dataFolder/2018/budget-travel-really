Text: "Scrolling down through Twitter feeds on motivational quotes every single morning\
  \ to find hope and just right words to get you out of the bed and start your day\
  \ was what I did for 2 years as I was going through mid-life crisis. I decided to\
  \ act on this quote.\n\n\u201CWhen in doubt, Travel\u201D\n\nSo I had to beg my\
  \ parents for 4 months to give me permission to travel Japan for 11 days on my first\
  \ solo backpacking trip something I have been wanting to do for my Dirty 30. Now\
  \ what grown women would want permission from her parents \u2013 This one does as\
  \ I was born in a culture where I would have been the talk of the town (not in a\
  \ good way) if I traveled solo. \n\nLittle did I know I would be spending 3 nights\
  \ on the streets of Japan like a homeless person seeking shelter. Public transportation\
  \ in Japan shuts down latest by 1pm and I mean literally close the doors so that\
  \ they can clean the station. I spent my 1 of the 3 nights in a bar at Golden Gai,\
  \ Tokyo where i spent talking to 3 men and a female bar owner through google translate\
  \ until 5am. 2nd night walking around Tokyo until I reach a bus station and took\
  \ shelter on the bench outside the station with other travelers who were waiting\
  \ for their bus. and 3rd one sleeping on a torn bench in open public restroom on\
  \ the streets of Kagoshima close to the station until a homeless Japanese male wakes\
  \ you up at 5:00am and lets you know that I can rest in the station and be warm\
  \ as it was freezing cold nowhere close to spring in early March. I couldn't understand\
  \ why the homeless Japanese male had been keeping a distance with me where ever\
  \ I walked, Later I knew he had been guarding the doors all night so that I don't\
  \ get myself into trouble with drunk young kids. On my train ride back to Tokyo,\
  \ I realized I had just witnessed humanity. He dint want any ill intentions towards\
  \ me or asked me for anything but gave me a sense of security in an unknown city.\
  \ \n\nFrom countless lessons I learned on this 11 day trip, this incident gave me\
  \ courage to finally embark on a bigger journey I had planned for myself for years\
  \ but never had the courage to take the 1st step. These memories always remind me\
  \ that world they show on T.V now looks so scary from the far but there is still\
  \ humanity when you see it up close. \n\nNow that I look back on my trip, even while\
  \ I walked  until I had blisters on my feet, sore shoulders or no place to sleep\
  \ for 3 nights in extreme weather, it was the best unplanned and unpredictable trip\
  \ I could have ever planned."
