Text: "The beach was bountifully inhabited with sun-drenched bodies; makeshift games\
  \ of futebal and volleyball alongside deckchair and caipirinha. Copacabana beach\
  \ was a living, breathing postcard. \n\u201CHow about we take the two of you out\
  \ in the favelas tonight?\u201D asked Thiago, our beach-shack barman. Past warnings\
  \ about Rio de Janeiro\u2019s danger and tourist-related crime were cast aside in\
  \ anticipation of mixing with Cariocas, the city\u2019s natives. Brazil is often\
  \ pinned as a Third World country. It is not, but the divide between the prosperous\
  \ and the under-class is vast. The favelas bordering the hills of Rio de Janeiro\
  \ are a prominent reminder of the latter; colourful shantytowns of shoddily constructed\
  \ dwellings piled one on top of another. Viewed from afar, it is a colourful mosaic.\
  \ Up close, a hive of activity. \nThiago and his girlfriend meet us at our hotel.\
  \ The taxi-van ride is exhilarating and life-threatening. Eventually we arrive at\
  \ the favela and follow Thiago up a maze of steps and through never ending walkways\
  \ as local eyes follow our every move. We enter a dwelling. Five of Thiago\u2019\
  s friends are relaxing, waiting in the sparse house furnished with bunk beds, a\
  \ nineties stereo and a few cooking utensils. We set off.   \nWe visit bars and\
  \ street vendors serving picinha. I stand out due to my size and Anglo features.\
  \ Rather than being stand-offish, they are intrigued. They start introducing me\
  \ as \u201CGringo Grande\u201D. The language barrier is nothing compared to the\
  \ locals\u2019 friendliness and exuberance. \nFinally, a nightclub, where Brazilian\
  \ hip-hop bounces off concrete walls; people dressed in vibrant colours dance sensually\
  \ and spontaneously. The favela inhabitants may be the poorest of the poor, but\
  \ they make up for it with their lust for living. \nWesterners say \u201Cto dance\
  \ like no one is watching.\u201D I think to translate this to Portuguese in the\
  \ favelas would be met with confusion, where people dance all the time, for the\
  \ enjoyment, for the moment. Whether anyone is watching or not is beside the point.\
  \ Cariocas live and act so freely, without many of the hang-ups and inhibitions\
  \ entrenched in our version of Western society.\nAs the night draws to a close,\
  \ I feel a tap on my shoulder. I turn to find one of Thiago\u2019s friends smiling\
  \ with outstretched hand. He is giving me back a one-hundred real bill, that due\
  \ to alcohol consumed and general carelessness I have let fall from my pocket. It\
  \ seems to drive home the point that there is more to life than financial wealth."
