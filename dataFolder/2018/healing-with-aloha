Text: "As a doctor I pay attention to and plan everything in great detail, which is\
  \ exactly why I was shocked to find out mid flight to San Jose (Costa Rica) that\
  \ I was actually on a flight to San Jose (California)... Booking a wrong flight\
  \ was definitely not what I was expecting. Why do they give different names to the\
  \ same cities?! Well, but that's exactly what happened. \n\nSo there I was, a 32\
  \ year old portuguese solo-traveler on the other side of the world, running away\
  \ from a grief situation and plenty of unresolved relationships, again all by myself,\
  \ having no one waiting for me anywhere else. \n\nAbout 6 hours later \u2013 and\
  \ with my backpack missing somewhere - I looked at a world map someone miraculously\
  \ left behind at the hotel I booked to spend the night.. filled with new chances,\
  \ I had the choice to either book another flight to my planned destination or to\
  \ take advantage of this opportunity and search for nearby alternatives I otherwise\
  \ would never have the chance to go to. Plan B. Think!! Re-arrange. Hawaii?.. wow,\
  \ I didn't saw that one coming. Let's go for it.\n\nIn this moment as I\u2019m writing\
  \ these words, I\u2019m coming close to complete exactly one month of travelling.\
  \ This is probably the best mistake I've ever done, since every new day is unplanned,\
  \ unexpected and therefore full of surprises and achievements.  In about 30 days,\
  \ I\u2019ve gone from the coolest beaches to tropical rainforests in Ohau, from\
  \ the most defying trails to amazing canyons at Kauai, from volcanic rock fields\
  \ to real lava flows in Big Island. I had poke, shaved ice, taro and plenty of other\
  \ delights I could afford and taste. I\u2019ve touched dark sand beaches, hiked\
  \ and reached the skies through a mesmerizing helicopter ride. I swam between waterfall\
  \ pools and walked barefoot when my sneakers got wet and dirty - and it didn\u2019\
  t bother me at all, because I was touching grass and humid soils and feeling nature\
  \ along the way. And in the meantime I got to know the best of people in these small\
  \ lost islands in Paradise; the \"Kindness of Strangers\", I once read.\n\nI don't\
  \ know where I'm going from here. I - thought - I was going to South America, but\
  \ that looks so far right now. \"Far America\" I shall call it from now on. But\
  \ I'll just go wherever I feel I want to, when the right time arrives.\n\nLesson?\
  \ We don't have it all figured out. We come to this age and we think we do but we\
  \ don't. And it's ok."
