Text: "I\u2019ve never been a dog person, but always a people person. I rely on meeting\
  \ people and making connections for my own nourishment, a reassurance of sense of\
  \ self, and an excitement about the world and those in it; this was only increased\
  \ by travelling Europe alone.  \n\nIn the heady mix of my early 20s, on the road,\
  \ low in socks and high in energy, I\u2019d careered across the typical track of\
  \ Croatian beaches and German beer halls. For months I\u2019d worn my passport and\
  \ the \u2018couple-of-shirts-some-undies-and-a-towel\u2019 luggage on my back and\
  \ myself on my sleeve. I\u2019d met and danced and kissed and whirled myself around\
  \ in a blaze of vigour, born somehow from late night pizzas, early in the day beers,\
  \ and minimal sleep.\n\nI\u2019d done it drunk on people; my mirrors as I\u2019\
  d stepped off buses at 5am, faces puffy, feet prepared. I\u2019d staved off loneliness\
  \ with other wandering hearts I\u2019d found in hostel bathrooms. Now at the end\
  \ of my travels, my last station was a farm in a tiny town in Ireland, Roscrea,\
  \ believing that relative isolation was what I needed before home. \n\nBut it wasn\u2019\
  t. I had gotten used to being surrounded by people who I could be loud and messy\
  \ with; unbridled sharing of my thoughts and feelings and my slices of pizza; resolutely\
  \ ignoring the fact I was starting to miss my boyfriend back home. I wound up arriving\
  \ at the farm, realising its isolation and how its slow internet wouldn\u2019t be\
  \ great for Skype, starting to panic, and then realising that on top of all that\
  \ three huge Rhodesian Ridgebacks lived inside the house, too.\n\nI wasn\u2019t\
  \ the type of person who would relish living with three big, affectionate, slobbery\
  \ dogs. I didn\u2019t know what to make of Asha, Carli and Reba, and I kept my distance\
  \ for the first few weeks. I got through my farm work but I still felt sad, and\
  \ tired, and closed off \u2013 but while these feelings are easy to hide with humans,\
  \ it turns out they\u2019re not so with dogs.\n\nI sat by the fire often, and Asha\
  \ liked to sit with me. But as time passed, our sitting together became less me\
  \ pushing her away, irritated, when she\u2019d try to lick my feet, and more me\
  \ finding comfort from her body warmth on my legs, and for her, resting her head\
  \ on me, content. I found, from us sitting together, a soothing of a restless heart.\
  \ It was only upon my return to Australia and showing my boyfriend galleries of\
  \ images I\u2019d taken of the dogs I realised that they\u2019d become, at the end,\
  \ my people. They\u2019d fended off the lonely clouds, paw by paw. \n\nI guess I\u2019\
  m a dog person now."
