Text: "Being a big brother comes with a lot of expectations, but other situations\
  \ come as a shock, when least expected. I get paid on Thursdays and my people are\
  \ well aware that when I have got cash, I paint the town with fun. I got a call\
  \ from my sister who had left her phone in Mpumalanga as she had visited a friend,\
  \ that doesn\u2019t make sense, I thought, who leaves a cellphone behind at this\
  \ day and age? Anyway, I tell her to wait for me at her friends place.\nI called\
  \ my friend whom I knew that the word NO doesn\u2019t exist in his vocab; he gets\
  \ excited as we are going on a trip closer to the Mozambique boarder. That can be\
  \ exciting for someone who hardly travels. We drive to go get the kids and we get\
  \ ready to leave the Free State for Mpumalanga and I am still wondering how possible\
  \ is it that my sister had forgotten her phone so far away from home. We drove for\
  \ hours without discussing the reason for the trip, let alone the exact location\
  \ or the reason why they went there to start with, all I knew was that I had to\
  \ help her get her phone back, as her big brother, all else mattered less.\nWe finally\
  \ see a board printed \u201CWelcome to Mpumalanga\u201D, which made me to relax\
  \ and even be able to start talking about the situation at hand without fearing\
  \ that my friend would attempt making a U-turn. I get told that there was a huge\
  \ matric dance after party in Mbombela a hip and happening town in Mpumalanga, yet\
  \ how or with who, the phone got left behind with, still remained unknown.\nWe get\
  \ spotted by a group of gents who recognizes the ladies in our company from the\
  \ party and they excitedly blab about what happened during and after the party.\
  \ I know that when people are in love, they don\u2019t always think straight, but\
  \ I had never expected for my sister to be stupid enough to allow her boyfriend\
  \ to bet with her phone which was a gift from our parents as she had almost finished\
  \ high school. The last thing I had expected was that these guys are respecting\
  \ the Cage, the supposedly notorious gangster to be in the area and they were preparing\
  \ to go stand outside the court to maintain his freedom. What a waste of time, money\
  \ and petrol. Moreover, what a shocking discovery."
