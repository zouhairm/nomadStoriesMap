Text: "I will tell you a short story, but I\u2019m sure, you won\u2019t believe it.\
  \ You might say, \u201Caw man, please be more credible!\u201D Because it\u2019s\
  \ like a fairytale. Maybe this is the moral: every fairytale was based on a true\
  \ story.\nSo once upon a time, I\u2019ve decided to get my backpack, and spend my\
  \ Easter at one of the most beautiful parts of my country, because travelling alone\
  \ is my passion, and because I had missed so much my \u201Cbackpacker life\u201D\
  , and because Argentina is beautiful. So, I choose the Iguazu-falls, which are beautiful,\
  \ enormous waterfalls of the Iguazu River on the border of the Argentine province\
  \ of Misiones and the Brazilian state of Paran\xE1.  They consist of 270 waterfalls\
  \ and cataracts varying between 60 to 82 meters. And all in the arms of wonderful\
  \ subtropical jungles: shared by the Iguaz\xFA National Park (Argentina) and Igua\xE7\
  u National Park (Brazil). The two parks were designated UNESCO World Heritage Sites.\
  \ So, I am excited, it should be awesome!\nArrived at the morning to the city of\
  \ Puerto Iguazu, the land of the red soil, bright blue sky, and unexpectable green\
  \ colours. From here, you have to catch another bus to the National Park. If you\
  \ had believed you can visit all the spectacles with one entrance, you were wrong.\
  \ You should decide which side will be the first, get the transport ticket, and\
  \ travel to the entrance. For me, the brazil part was the first. After crossing\
  \ the border, what took about 40 minutes, we are arriving at the Igua\xE7u National\
  \ Park. You can pay with credit card, or peso, dollar, and it\u2019s not so expensive:\
  \ 60-65 Brazilian Real. They raised the price. Of course, they did. My sweethearts.\
  \ Bus again, safari transport to the waterfalls, and the pure magic.\nOn the way\
  \ back home I had the luck to admire a beautiful tropical storm too, it\u2019s not\
  \ so rare in Misiones (the province near the waterfalls), so wish you luck too!\
  \ Unbelievable, awesome trip, and most extraordinary Easter in my life. I felt really\
  \ close to God in the Devil\u2019s Throat.\nAnd its my travel story. \n        \
  \                        -Capt. Ankush Dasgupta"
