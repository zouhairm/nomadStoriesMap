Text: "The air is hot and dry. Colored powder \u2013 gulal \u2013 stains my skin,\
  \ which is dry and itchy under the thick coating. I sit on a wooden crate in someone\u2019\
  s backyard, hidden behind a wall. I can hear the whooping and laughing from the\
  \ opposite side. I touch my face and flinch in pain.\nI glance at my reflection\
  \ in a piece of glass on the ground and barely recognize the ghostly face looking\
  \ back at me. My eyes, bloodshot and teary, stand out against the stark whiteness\
  \ of my face. My lips are chapped and cracking. A scab is forming under my nose\
  \ from where I keep rubbing it. The small bump of a bruise is rising on my cheek.\n\
  I know I will eventually have to leave this yard and return to the street, but I\
  \ am tired and scared. I had arrived in India two days earlier excited to observe\
  \ Holi, the festival of colors and love celebrating the triumph of good over evil.\
  \ The irony of this is not lost on me as I cradle my broken sunglasses in my hands\
  \ and feel the small bald spots on my head where clumps of hair had been ripped\
  \ out. My eyes burn and my throat aches.\nI had read about the Holi festival for\
  \ months before my trip and was excited for what was always described as a beautiful\
  \ religious holiday with breathtaking spiritual ceremonies in temples and colorful\
  \ celebrations in the streets. In the morning that is exactly what my experience\
  \ had been; in the afternoon the partying took a scary turn.\nWhether it was the\
  \ whiteness of my skin or the paleness of my hair or just the fact that I\u2019\
  m a woman, I don\u2019t know, but no matter where I went I was swarmed by groups\
  \ of men. They tugged at my hair, grabbed at my breasts, pulled at my shirt to expose\
  \ my shoulders and chest. I had been wearing sunglasses to protect my eyes from\
  \ the powder until a hand ripped them from my face and snapped them in half. Powder\
  \ was shoved by the handful into my mouth so I couldn\u2019t breathe and thrown\
  \ into my eyes so I couldn\u2019t see.\nA hole in a fence led to the yard where\
  \ I now sit, catching my breath and inspecting my wounds. I realize I must make\
  \ a decision. There will be three more hours of chaos beyond the wall before the\
  \ streets will empty. I can sit here and wait, the gulal drying out my skin, pulling\
  \ it taut over my bruised body, or I can brace myself and fight my way through the\
  \ crowds to find a tuk tuk that will take me the 14 kilometers to my hotel.\nWith\
  \ a deep breath I stand, the remains of my sunglasses fall to the ground, and I\
  \ duck through the hole in the wall. I am on a mission."
