Text: "I was staying in the line to board a flight with the destination from where\
  \ people usually leave, I instead was getting in -  Kabul. It was May 31st 2014\
  \ and I was 26 yo. I signed up for an experience which happen to be both ... a blessing\
  \ and a curse. Before it, I was living the dream life of many people, the life in\
  \ a paradise how they say. Dominican Republic has been my home for over 3 years,\
  \ just before I decided to leave it for what many people have no luck to ever find:\
  \ \"The mission of your life\". There are 2 most important days in your life, the\
  \ day you were born, and the day you found out WHY? Afghanistan and all what has\
  \ happen to me in that 1 year, has been the most meaningful experience of my life.\
  \  I never wanted to be just a traveler who goes somewhere for one week and enjoys\
  \ with the locals a cup of tea, then leaves it and writes reviews which are all\
  \ the same:\" The most beautiful country, the most hospitable people and the best\
  \ food\". All are the same. The truth is that being a simple traveler makes you\
  \ to see the country from the surface but what how is the mind, actions and life\
  \ of those people you can see when you \"became part of them\". From the organization\
  \ I was part of local chapter in Afghanistan, I was elected to be President for\
  \ the upcoming term 2014/2015. The locals gave their vote to a foreigner and a woman.\
  \ That's how they chose their first female and international Leader. The election\
  \ day made history for both, them and me. Any part being truly aware what this would\
  \ mean, what to expect and the most important \"how to handle\" it. When have been\
  \ asked:Why Afghanistan? which I was for thousands of times, I simply couldn't make\
  \ logical answer with top 3 reasons why. I just answered:\" Maktub\" - It was meant\
  \ to be. From the first moment when I saw the call for the applications and despite\
  \ the fact that there were 3 more male and local candidates for this role, the whole\
  \ me felt that this has been written for me. It was a year full of unexpected challenges.\
  \ Yet, people are calling it - Legendary. There were moments when I wanted to leave\
  \ everything and run away from there, moments when I screamingly cried without making\
  \ a sound because I it was to heavy to handle it more etc. But, for any money in\
  \ the world, I wouldn't \"sell\" that life experience, because The Last Thing I\
  \ Expected ... was to fall in LOVE with it, so deeply that I still carry it with\
  \ me, as both..a blessing and a curse. \nAfghanistan, because I loved you before\
  \ I meet you.."
