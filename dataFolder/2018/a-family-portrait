Text: "Walking closer to the center of Alfama, the noise of traffic and large groups\
  \ of people disappear altogether. Streets run like veins through colourful close-knit\
  \ buildings, only wide enough in some places to allow single file entry. \n\nThere\u2019\
  s a whisper the residents of Lisbon\u2019s oldest district feel as if they live\
  \ in a zoo. The locals are stared at while foreign voices reverberate on stone buildings,\
  \ exclaiming their love for such a quaint town. However, this proclaimed love falls\
  \ short without a simple smile to the locals and a lack of understanding of their\
  \ strong bond. \n\nA woman leans out her window on a narrow iron balcony, high above\
  \ meandering tourists, and asks her neighbour in local tongue if they\u2019d seen\
  \ Maria. \u201CThe curtains are closed,\u201D they reply, and both agree to keep\
  \ an eye out for her. A brief, yet perfect encounter exemplifying the connection\
  \ between the residents and the importance they place on feelings of family and\
  \ community. \n\nHanging on a stone wall beneath the neighbours, is a black and\
  \ white oval picture of Carmelinda, a robust lady famous for making Ginjinha (or\
  \ Ginja), a sour cherry liqueur. A passing traveler, marked by a tell-tale backpack,\
  \ must have encountered the same picture as they knock quickly on this woman\u2019\
  s door. A bemused Carmelinda answers, and a nervous rush takes over me as I look\
  \ on and think this intrusion on her home is considered incredibly rude. \n\n\u201C\
  Ginjinha?\u201D the traveler asks, cheerily. I am overcome with fear this woman\
  \ is very unhappy with the unexpected presence. Upon seeing the friendly traveler\u2019\
  s face, the woman\u2019s bewilderment transforms as her own smile spans wide where\
  \ tense lips once belonged.\n\nAs I witness the welcoming encounter, I slide into\
  \ the opportunity to drink Ginjinha with them both. Eager to share this local custom\
  \ with us, we are transitioned into something more than passing tourists as we stand\
  \ in Carmelinda\u2019s doorway and are offered two shots of the liqueur. She joins\
  \ us as we down the home-made crimson drink. \u201CIt\u2019s very strong!\u201D\
  \ I express wide-eyed as a fire dances through my throat from such a small dosage,\
  \ reminding me of cough medicine but tasting infinitely better.\n\nCarmelinda and\
  \ I continue to converse in the fragments of Portuguese I can remember about her\
  \ long residency in Alfama. Suddenly she warns me of the pick pockets around the\
  \ city. \u201CBe very careful,\u201D she tells me, \u201CWatch your bags.\u201D\
  \ This sobers me up rapidly and I am grateful to be reminded, family looks out for\
  \ one another."
