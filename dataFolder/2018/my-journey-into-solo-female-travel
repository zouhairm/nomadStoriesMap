Text: "I\u2019ve always been told never to go anywhere alone, to always let someone\
  \ know I\u2019m safe when I return home at night, to be on guard, because I\u2019\
  m vulnerable, being a woman. But where is my freedom to roam? By the age of twenty-seven,\
  \ it became apparent to me that I had developed a fear of my own aloneness, and\
  \ so I set about conquering it. I asked myself where are you most afraid to go alone\
  \ in the world? My answer was, undoubtedly, India. But India was the scotch bonnet\
  \ of female travel, the mother of all chillies, and I knew my system was not ready\
  \ for that intensity of heat, not yet. Nepal seemed a more sensible option. It was\
  \ the jalapeno, the serrano pepper, and could ease me in more gently.\n After three\
  \ sleepless nights in Kathmandu, exploring monkey temples and rotating an oversized\
  \ paper map in my hand for a clarity that never came, I travelled to Bhaktapur,\
  \ one of the three royal cities in the Kathmandu valley. As I exited the taxi in\
  \ the square, a local spotted the guitar strapped to my backpack. He looked eighteen\
  \ or nineteen, and was dressed all in black, wearing an \u2019ACDC\u2019 T-shirt.\
  \ He spoke in broken English. \u201CYou play gui-tar\u2019 he said.  \u201CI work\
  \ in music shop, you come and play with me and my friends.\u201D His name was Bikram\
  \ and despite my father\u2019s voice in my ear telling me to not trust anyone, I\
  \ chose to go against his advice. Not only did I jam with Bikram and his friends\
  \ in their music shop that evening, but we developed a close friendship which resulted\
  \ in me being taken to the camp where Bikram lived with his family. The earthquake\
  \ the previous year had destroyed his home and claimed the lives of many of his\
  \ friends. Countless people were still living in tents outside the main tourist\
  \ square. I was introduced to them. I sat eating dahl baht with my hands on their\
  \ clay floors, listening to their stories, crying with them, singing with them.\
  \ I became a part of the community in Bhaktapur, drinking chai with the shop owners\
  \ in the mornings, visiting the local schools to talk English with the children,\
  \ helping them. Bikram told me stories and took me to parties on rooftops where\
  \ we flew kites into the night sky. Nepal became a home from home, the people my\
  \ second family, and I stayed there for five months, travelling. Meeting Bikram\
  \ taught me to trust my intuitions. He taught me travel is art: a manifestation\
  \ of your own soul, and is needed now more than ever. He taught me that on the other\
  \ side of fear there is always love, hope and connection."
