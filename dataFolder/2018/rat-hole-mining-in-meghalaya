Text: "I stand at the opening of a 200ft deep illegal coal mine in the Jainita Hills\
  \ region of Meghalaya, India. I watch Geevan Magur carefully begin his descent into\
  \ the darkness down a rickety ladder to hand-mine coal. Magur is a Nepalese man\
  \ in his 50s who stands around 5ft tall. He carries an empty bamboo basket on his\
  \ back, a pickax in his right hand, and wears no form of safety equipment. Blind\
  \ in his right eye, he is overly cautious. He takes calculated steps down the ladder\
  \ and says, \u201CIf I don\u2019t work, my family doesn\u2019t eat.\u201D This begins\
  \ his 12-hour shift as a rat-hole miner. \nMost miners in this area are illegal\
  \ immigrants from Nepal. A 31 year old neighbor of Magur\u2019s, Bhopal Rai, stands\
  \ with me at mouth of the mine. He emigrated from Nepal 4 years ago. Rai was the\
  \ first in his family to come to Meghalaya. \u201CWe know it\u2019s illegal,\u201D\
  \ he says. \u201CThe Indian Parliament shut down the mines in April of 2014, but\
  \ if we don\u2019t mine, how will we live?\u201D Now his two brothers, Manichandra\
  \ Rai and Pardesi Kanchha, along with their families, have also migrated to the\
  \ village.\nRat-hole mining, a primitive, dangerous, and illegal method of hand-mining\
  \ coal, involves digging pits, 100ft to 300ft deep, into the ground to reach the\
  \ coal vein. Once the vein is reached, narrow tunnels are made perpendicular into\
  \ the vein, and miners, often children, crawl into the cramped shafts, sometimes\
  \ only 2ft high, to hand-mine coal. \u201CWhile one person is down in the pits,\u201D\
  \ Bhopal explains to me as his eyes survey the land, \u201Canother stands watch\
  \ for the police.\u201D\nI learn from Rai that inside the rat hole, the air is rich\
  \ with sulfur, and the walls and ground are incessantly wet. Cave-ins are common\
  \ due to the instability of the earth once it\u2019s mined. They are also regularly\
  \ known to flood. In December 2013, 5 workers died when the cable attached to the\
  \ coal bucket they were riding snapped; 15 men drowned in a mine in July 2001; and\
  \ in 2002, 40 men were killed when water rushed through the mine. Since most miners\
  \ are undocumented, there are no exact reports on the number of deaths each year.\
  \ Luckily for Rai and Magur, they have escaped death or serious injury.\nI finally\
  \ see Magur at the bottom of the ladder. Black coal is filled to the brim of his\
  \ basket. His body is covered in soot. His shoulders roll forward to adjust to the\
  \ weight he carries. As he starts his slow ascent Rai says, \u201CIt\u2019s not\
  \ a tough decision. It\u2019s dangerous and illegal, but I have to feed my family.\
  \ It\u2019s what I have to do.\u201D"
