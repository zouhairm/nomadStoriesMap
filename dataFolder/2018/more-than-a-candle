Text: "Encounters with other members of our global society can be so varied. Transactional,\
  \ momentary, unconscious, passionate, circumstantial and so on. Once in a while,\
  \ a connection can be made that surpasses all language, culture and societal barriers.\
  \ The earth is a spectacular place, but many wise travellers will tell you that\
  \ their best memories involve the people they met along the way.\nThe nomadic people\
  \ of the Mongolian countryside are self-sufficient heroes of these baron lands.\
  \ Everything available to them is used resourcefully and creatively in order not\
  \ just to survive but to live, and seemingly happily. Possessions are not of value,\
  \ home is not a Location, and happiness is not reliant on status and wealth. I once\
  \ met a woman who showed me all of these things, and I could not even tell you her\
  \ name. There were many obstacles during our encounter, none of which failed the\
  \ experience or the impact she made on me. Late October was the beginning of winter\
  \ in the Gobi Desert. My travel buddies and I sat around in candlelight and our\
  \ friendly host came in to add fuel to the fire literally, as she started threw\
  \ brown clumps into the bottom of the furnace. She smiled and knew we were incredibly\
  \ grateful from the smiles we returned - a smile crosses every border and barrier\
  \ in the world. It turns out she knew one word in English as she pointed to the\
  \ fuel and joyfully stated that it was \u201Csh*t\u201D - apparently frozen camel\
  \ excrement keeps Mongolia warm! When our candle melted away, I volunteered myself\
  \ to brace the winter winds and ask or another.\nAs I peered in the neighbouring\
  \ ger, all smiles greeted me as mother, child, and grandmother looked up. The mother\
  \ was busy with cleaning what on closer inspection was the internal organs of an\
  \ animal. I was attempting to sign that the candle had run out - but my encounter\
  \ was much more than the exchange of a stick of wax. Seeing the closeness of the\
  \ family and the simple life they led was poignant for me. We exchanged what limited\
  \ concepts we could around family, food and life, and there was warmth and a care\
  \ to the conversation that need not be communicated. This lady taught me more than\
  \ Mongolian life and Mongolian culture. She shared with me a sense of family and\
  \ happiness that was not reliant on anyone else. She had humour in her knowledge\
  \ of one English word, she was happy sharing her culture with her visitors and she\
  \ was nothing but open to caring for us. \nShe gave me so much more than a candle\
  \ that evening."
