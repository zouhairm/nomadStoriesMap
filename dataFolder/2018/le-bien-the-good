Text: "I offered to sit in the back. Even though it was my first time in Africa I\
  \ had heard enough descriptions to expect over-crowded transportations. This was\
  \ just the first one. So I got in, fitting into the two people space that was now\
  \ accommodating three. And I was fine, since I am not the tallest girl around. Next\
  \ to me was a thin but very tall guy, and next to him an older man. It was a 3 hour\
  \ ride from Bissau to Bafat\xE1. Considering we would be stuck and very close together\
  \ for the next few hours, and also excited about the destination we still knew nothing\
  \ about, we started talking. Le Bi\xE9n, the thin, tall guy, named by the french\
  \ nurse who helped his mother give birth, couldn\u2019t have a more appropriate\
  \ name. He was genuinely one of the nicest people I have ever met. Looking way younger\
  \ than his actual age - a surprising 27 - he was traveling to be a referee for a\
  \ football game. He was also studying environmental policies. He explained a lot\
  \ about his country, mostly nature. And when I asked about the art scene, being\
  \ an artist myself, he enthusiastically told me that he was friends with one of\
  \ the biggest plastic artists in the country and offered to set up a meeting. Doubtful\
  \ of the greatness of this artist, but eager to meet him anyway, we exchanged numbers\
  \ and agreed to set it up once we got back to Bissau.\nA few days later we agreed\
  \ on the place to meet. Botodjo arrived accompanied by one of his students with\
  \ Le Bi\xE9n, and we walked up to the french institute to see some of his commissioned\
  \ work. The truth was that after over ten days in Guin\xE9, I still couldn\u2019\
  t find any information about the arts. When we got to the institute I started to\
  \ realize that he was in fact, one of the biggest artists there. His work was original\
  \ and something I could never imagine. We had some drinks and talked about the art\
  \ scene. Unfortunately, as one of the poorest countries in the world, there is zero\
  \ investment in arts. No university, no museum. And the traditions are nothing more\
  \ than craftsmanship made exclusively for rituals. He was fighting for things I\
  \ had always taken for granted and was not only talented but inspiring. I left the\
  \ meeting feeling grateful for the impromptu meeting.\nOn our last day in Guin\xE9\
  , Le Bi\xE9n came to say goodbye. By the end of our trip I was happy to call him\
  \ a friend. He brought us a bracelet with our name on it, a sweet gesture from a\
  \ sweet guy. And because of him, I was able to learn so much - all from saying hello\
  \ in the back of a car."
