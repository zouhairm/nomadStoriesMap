Text: "I have been soul-searching since my husband\u2019s death. Amidst the devastation\
  \ in earthquake-ravaged Nepal, I hoped to find some sense of purpose. On impulse,\
  \ I decided to join a volunteer organization rebuilding a school in the remote mountains\
  \ of Nuwakot, Nepal. I have no idea about construction nor am I into DIY repairs,\
  \ but I had the enthusiasm for helping people recover from disasters. Little did\
  \ I know that this decision will push me to the edge of my comfort zone.\n\nFrom\
  \ Kathmandu, scenic landscapes fascinated me throughout the 2-hour bus ride. With\
  \ the rhythmic Nepalese music on the radio, and the locals carefully holding on\
  \ to their goats and chickens on board, I was unperturbed. At the base camp, it\
  \ was as I expected: barracks-type of shelter in a tent accommodating 40 volunteers;\
  \ outdoor loo (a hole-in-the-ground, essentially); and cold showers in tarpaulin-covered\
  \ cubicles. \u201CDal bhat power\u201D was something I learned at the camp. Dal\
  \ (lentils) and bhat (rice) were served up consistently for lunch for the duration\
  \ of my volunteer work. Three weeks of dal bhat power.\n\n\u201CPour Day\u201D was\
  \ a much-awaited event amongst so many other activities in the camp. Human chains\
  \ of volunteers hurriedly and systematically passed cement, water, gravel and sand.\
  \ It was hard work but rewarding once we saw the school building taking shape. The\
  \ blisters in my hands were forgotten. My undernourished tummy appeased by the sight\
  \ of children, teachers and parents happily awaiting the completion of their learning\
  \ grounds.\n\nThe end of my volunteering days in Nuwakot coincided with the end\
  \ of the Dashain festival, an elaborate celebration among the Hindus in Nepal. \
  \ Volunteers, including myself, joined the community in a joyful festivity, singing\
  \ and dancing with the children. Before my departure, I received a tika, a light\
  \ dab of red vermilion, on my forehead from one of the school teachers as a symbol\
  \ of blessing.\n\nBefore I hiked back down to the village, I sat on my favorite\
  \ swing made of a thin sheet of blue worn-out cloth overlooking the gorgeous mountains.\
  \  I was grateful.  I found peace."
