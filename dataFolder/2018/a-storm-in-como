Text: "I wasn\u2019t even supposed to be in Italy. I\u2019d arrived as a white knight\
  \ intending to help with some family drama, but once everyone\u2019s flights had\
  \ already flown, I was left alone with a day to spare. And so I took a train, with\
  \ the early morning sun piercing the window, from the grand Milano Centrale to the\
  \ decidedly quieter Lake Como. The day had felt entirely removed from time, the\
  \ steep mountains either side of the quaint town and the serene lake that lapped\
  \ up at the edges of the promenade helping to foster a sense of complete and utterly\
  \ blissful seclusion.\n\nSo it was quite a shock when the thunderstorm came, knocking\
  \ out the town\u2019s electricity and dropping it into darkness. I was dressed in\
  \ a t-shirt and shorts, forced to take shelter under the ornate balconies of the\
  \ town as I tried to guide myself back to the train station from memory alone\u2014\
  my phone having died earlier that day. The sound of heavy rain was dotted with great\
  \ laughter as those who had also been caught out in the storm raced past me in search\
  \ for their own place to hide.\n\nI soon accepted I was lost. Without GPS to guide\
  \ me I was next to useless, and so set about posing \u2018la stazione?\u2019 to\
  \ every passerby I could. By chance I met an Italian, a Como resident in fact, who\
  \ was also heading to the train station. He guided me through the darkened streets,\
  \ chatting away all the way. The cold, thick drops of water had caused me to hunch\
  \ over as I innately tried to retain the body heat that was slipping away, but the\
  \ Italian strode through it as though his tight-fitting shirt could repel the rain.\n\
  \nThe station was running on secondary power, with enough dim lighting to at least\
  \ avoid hitting a wall. With more than an hour to wait, my newfound friend and I\
  \ had only one option; we took a pair of seats in the corner of the station\u2019\
  s bar, taking it in turns to buy each other a glass of amaretto. The conversation\
  \ was easy: him a chatty, passionate Italian and me more drunk on the almond liqueur\
  \ than I\u2019d liked to admit. \n\nWe had found great interest in the bar\u2019\
  s visitors, a true melting point where Chinese kids played Uno by candlelight, British\
  \ tourists with their unnecessarily large suitcases drank tiny bottles of red wine,\
  \ and local officers stopped by for a pick-me-up. So easy the time had been that\
  \ before long it was time to board the train back to Milan. My Italian guide had\
  \ even come to see me off, and it was then\u2014as he waved through the window\u2014\
  that I realised that I would never even know his name."
