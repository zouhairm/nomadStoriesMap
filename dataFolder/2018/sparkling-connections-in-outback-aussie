Text: "Sip a glass of wine, in the Aussie Arkaroola outback, under the stars with\
  \ soft music playing.  Alone or with a friend.  The sky is so vast, the heavens\
  \ so unattainable, so unthinkable, even a top space nut can\u2019t know what\u2019\
  s really out there.  Everyone, though, can feel, can connect with the vast darkness,\
  \ the billions of twinkling lights, the huge unknowingness, the mystery, the potential\
  \ spirituality, the awe.\n\nI was very lucky to be allowed to take Tenterfield puppy,\
  \ Puck, on the Extreme 4WD Ridgetop tour, he was allowed to come in his little dilly-bag,\
  \ which I hung around my neck. Portia, my older Maltese x Shitzu stayed in my car,\
  \ at the community centre, I left my keys with the Administrator, who told me later\
  \ that Portia would not let her get anywhere near the car. \n\nThe Extreme 4WD Ridgetop\
  \ adventure is fabulous.  We drove over places, I can\u2019t call them roads, tracks\
  \ and rocky ledges, which normal people would never consider driving across.  This\
  \ was an adventure unlike anything else in the world.  At the top of Sillers Lookout,\
  \ we could see across the centre of Australia, for generations, for eons, for multitudes\
  \ of millions of years.  We had a cup of tea.  \n\nI let Pucky out of his dilly-bag\
  \ for a bladder release, but I was advised by the driver to watch carefully, in\
  \ case a Wedge Tailed Eagle, swooped down and grabbed him as a morsel of lunch.\
  \  \n\nThis land was originally home to the Adnyamathanha aboriginal people whose\
  \ connection is cyclical, not linear, as western culture engages.  \n\nArkaroola\
  \ is owned by the Sprigg family, who purchased the land for wildlife preservation\
  \ in 1967.  It had been used by sheep farmers and miners.  Rubies and sapphires\
  \ were found near Mount Pitt in 1903, then Uranium and radium in 1924.  The Extreme\
  \ 4WD track was first established by the mining company.  \n\nIn 2012 the SA State\
  \ Government legislated the Arkaroola protection Act to preserve this unique wild\
  \ arid mountain range environment for posterity as per the desire of geologists,\
  \ Douglas Mawson, Reg Sprigg and physicist, Mark Oliphant.  The geological landscape,\
  \ laid bare, is a 3D window to rock structures and features normally buried deep\
  \ below the cover.  (Arkaroola Wilderness Sanctuary, 2018, https://www.arkaroola.com.au/sprigg.php)\
  \  Today Australian geology students travel here to study the unique geological\
  \ forms not found anywhere else in the world.\n\nIt's possible to camp or stay in\
  \ motel style accommodation.  A community centre provides info and food."
