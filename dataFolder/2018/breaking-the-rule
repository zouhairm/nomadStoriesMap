Text: "I follow two cardinal rules for travel religiously. First, don't believe a\
  \ word an Italian says in regard to the scheduled time of anything. Second, don't\
  \ take photos of children. \n\nThe first rule is empirical. Proof of a trying battle\
  \ I now begrudgingly admit has mellowed my American time expectations. Nothing ever\
  \ goes as scheduled. It's a sly reminder to stay calm when plans inevitably go awry.\
  \ Sure bus 7 may not actually exist, but rage helps no one.\n  \nThe second is traditional.\
  \ It's personal. Passed down through the generations, from my grandfather to my\
  \ father to me. A simple blunt reminder to carefully consider the eager impulse\
  \ to document every moment of your travel in the digital age of unlimited shots.\
  \ \"Children are not tourist attractions. Do not take photos of them.\"\n\nOn October\
  \ 17, 2017, I shot an elated girl chasing bubbles in Naples. It's now my favorite\
  \ photo.\n\nI was taught a host of ethical reasons behind the ban. Children are\
  \ not public figures. Children cannot give or refuse consent to be photographed.\
  \ Men taking photos of kids, particularly girls not their own, is just creepy. When\
  \ abroad, a good rule of thumb is not to be creepy.\n\nBut, it's so dynamic. She\
  \ has such joy. I had to.\n\nI arrived in Naples on an Erasmus trip caught between\
  \ worlds, a walking enigma. A new college grad working for the university's exchange\
  \ office, but obliged to take classes for my visa, no one knew how to label me.\
  \ Student or employee? Students happily befriend exchange students. Few befriend\
  \ employees. Back at the hostel, bonding over cool photos could mean new friends.\n\
  \nWhen I look back at the photo the conflicted churn of emotions returns. Posted\
  \ to Instagram for hopeful new friends to like, the screen transports me to that\
  \ moment. Guilt rushes in and captures me. My subjects look everywhere but at me,\
  \ unaware of me. Of what I broke.\n\nBut, then something bursts through the edges\
  \ of my dishonor. Pride.\n\nThe girl has one foot raised she is mid-run and, from\
  \ her beaming face, I argue mid-giggle. Head tilted in delight she runs forth, her\
  \ sole purpose in life to pop just one bubble. The mime, back to the lens, gently\
  \ offers up his string to the unfolding Church of San Francesco before him.\n\n\
  Both stand transfixed, content in their shared childish delight, framed dead center\
  \ in Naples' main piazza. Gazing at the bubbles dancing in the Italian Blue sky.\n\
  \nThe last thing I expected was to take that shot.\n\nYet, I smile as wide as that\
  \ girl every time I see her."
