Text: "I nearly lost my passport on the Russian-Mongolian border. An official had\
  \ forgotten to give it back to me when he stepped off the train moments before we\
  \ left the station. The more we move into the unknown, the higher the risk.\n\n\
  I arrived in Beijing and moved south along the Chinese coast, with less and less\
  \ preparation. The arrival in Qingdao went smoothly. Shanghai was a little rockier,\
  \ and Xiamen was completely improvised. I couldn\u2019t figure out the public transport\
  \ system and ended up walking for two hours with 25 kilograms on my back until I\
  \ arrived at a dingy hostel. I felt great. \n\nThe unknown brings with it a sense\
  \ of freedom.\n\nSo, I went diving. I made my way to Pulau Weh, a small island to\
  \ the north of Sumatra. For seven days I dived, ate, rested; dived, ate, slept.\
  \ It was bliss, breathing underwater. \n\nI had not told my mother about my diving\
  \ plans. Her brother had died as a navy diver, years before I was born, and it had\
  \ been a trauma for a long time. When I texted her afterwards, she told me I had\
  \ been right to keep still.\n\nFrom Pulau Weh I moved south across Sumatra with\
  \ the roads getting progressively worse. I looked out the window and down where\
  \ I expected to see asphalt. But a chunk had dropped out and I was looking at a\
  \ steep hillside. \n\nIn Bali I left some things behind. Then a flight to Manado,\
  \ a boat to Bunaken, back to Manado, straight onto the flight to Ternate. \nThere\
  \ I hesitated. I was planning to go to the remote island Morotai, but I was travelling\
  \ ever faster. My heavy bag had been my anchor, weighing me down, but now I was\
  \ moving effortlessly and uncontrolled.\n\nI took the plunge.\n\nSo I found myself\
  \ on Morotai. I\u2019d found a phone number of someone who offered shark dives.\
  \ In poor English, he replied he would take me for a dive in two days\u2019 time.\n\
  \nDuring the days, I shuffled about the small town. I couldn\u2019t communicate\
  \ with the locals. I hardly noticed the heat. I was in a state of pure travel.\n\
  \nDuring the nights, I lay awake in a small room of an empty hostel. I tossed and\
  \ turned on the sunken mattress, below a slowly spinning ceiling fan. I thought\
  \ about diving.\n\nI thought about me floating out there, next to the island, staring\
  \ into an abyss where the colours were slowly disappearing. I thought of the dangers\
  \ of diving without a clear state of mind. I thought and I thought and I decided\
  \ against it.\n\nI made my way back. I picked up what I\u2019d left behind in Bali.\
  \ Via Singapore, I moved back into my world."
