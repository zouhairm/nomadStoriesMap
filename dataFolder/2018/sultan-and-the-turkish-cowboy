Text: "The reins pull through my hands, rope-burn scoring and turning my fingers purple\
  \ as they grip the mane of my horse. We speed through the flats of the Goreme Valley\
  \ out of control but hanging on for both pride and out of muscle memory. Sultan,\
  \ a stallion entrusted to me by Turkey's \u2018horse-whisperer\u2019 lurches forward\
  \ in a full gallop as wind slaps tears from my eyes and the landscape blurs into\
  \ the distance behind me while cliffs lined with caves bear closer. \nIt's September\
  \ 2014, and I am horse-riding with the Dalton Brothers in the heart of central Anatolia,\
  \ \u2018the land of beautiful horses\u2019. \nMy expectation was that this would\
  \ be a challenging ride with experienced riders. \nOn arrival to the ranch I asked\
  \ my fellow companions about their experience horse riding. Every single person\
  \ said it was their first time. \nI felt I\u2019d been scammed by another tourist\
  \ trap. Disappointed, I walked over to a dusty hut with a painted door that read\
  \ \u2018office\u2019 and stepped inside. A man leant against the table with his\
  \ spurs nudging the desk, he was the epitome of a Cowboy. I immediately felt intimidated.\
  \ \u201CI need your best horse and a guide, I\u2019m not interested in the trail\
  \ ride\u201D, Ekrem immediately stood up, eyeing me he asked if I could really ride,\
  \ suddenly I felt unsure of my ability. \u201C...Yes\u201D, I answered. He walked\
  \ out of the office chewing a strand of hay and carrying the stance of someone who\u2019\
  s ridden their entire life.\nHe turned and called to me from outside where he stood\
  \ by an Arab stallion, the stallion was stocky, and coloured dapple grey with a\
  \ white mane. \u201CThis is Sultan, my best horse, you\u2019ll go with a guide,\
  \ be back by sunset\u201D. \nMy guide mounted her horse, laughing while telling\
  \ me Sultan was a handful as he abruptly took off, bolting through the desert flats.\
  \ I lost my stirrup and any previous confidence as we sped further into the valley.\
  \ The trails narrowed with 30 to 40 foot sheer drops lining either side and little\
  \ room for more than Sultan\u2019s hooves. There was no turning around from this\
  \ point.\nGradually I managed to calm Sultan, his nostrils flaring with excitement.\
  \ I tethered him and climbed into a high cliff edge to regain my breath, from my\
  \ vantage point I could see all of Goreme Valley and sitting in silence I reflected\
  \ over my time in Turkey, realising that this was one of the more profound moments\
  \ I'd experienced. I felt lucky. This region, the history it carries and the ethos\
  \ of Ekrem and his ranch has a lot more to offer than what first meets the eye."
