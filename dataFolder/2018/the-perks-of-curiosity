Text: "\u201CI am the most unnoticeable person in the world.\u201D At least so I thought\
  \ until winter 2014.\nI am at a shopping center in Turkey, Erzurum. Just bought\
  \ another chocolate ice cream. I love Turkish ice cream! It\u2019s thick, so I can\
  \ enjoy it longer. But this time I am eating it absent-mindedly, too busy staring\
  \ around at everything my eyes can capture. Wow! Soap in a form of berries and fruits!\
  \ So realistic! And here! Nice dress, looks so Turkish! And people! They are different.\
  \ But how? No idea.\nI am sitting alone. Three other girls I came with are buying\
  \ something. My new friend from Poland calls them \u201Cshopping tigers\u201D. I\
  \ don\u2019t want to buy anything. I\u2019d rather stare around and remember every\
  \ moment of my journey. Suddenly I hear a voice behind me: \u201CCan I take a photo\
  \ with you?\u201D Utterly perplexed, I turn around and see two pretty and young\
  \ girls with long brown hair and big blue eyes. They are smiling sheepishly. \u201C\
  Of course\u201D I hear myself say, \u201CWhy not?\u201D\nNow I am running. Just\
  \ found out I had lost my scarf somewhere. \u201CExcuse me! Have you seen my scarf?\
  \ A scarf, you know\u2026 It\u2019s blue. A scarf.\u201D I am touching my neck and\
  \ making random movements. A tall blond woman at a store doesn\u2019t seem to understand\
  \ me. I am desperate! Where can it be, my favorite scarf? Suddenly a trace of understanding\
  \ appears on her face, and at once, it becomes sympathetic and kind. She goes outside\
  \ and beckons me to follow her. We come to a lost and found office. There it is!\
  \ \u201CThank you!\u201D \u201CI am from?\u201D she says. \u201CKazakistan\u201D\
  \ I say in a Turkish manner.\nSince I have found my scarf, I need to go find my\
  \ friends, we\u2019re out of time. I step onto the escalator and start moving downwards.\
  \ All of a sudden, I hear a distant shout, subconsciously turn my head to the source\
  \ of noise and see a young couple holding hands and going upwards on another escalator.\
  \ They start waving their hands at me. Me? \u201CKonnichiwa!\u201D I hear. Do I\
  \ look like Japanese? I smile and wave my hand too. Should I say I am not Japanese?\
  \ No time. \u201CKonnichiwa!\u201D I scream back and laugh.\nNow I understand. They\
  \ are as curious as I am. I look different, maybe behave differently. Additionally,\
  \ they rarely see foreigners in their town. That is how my English teacher felt;\
  \ he was the first foreigner my classmates and I saw. Somehow I feel pleased, not\
  \ annoyed. It\u2019s fine that they want to see new faces, get acquainted with other\
  \ cultures. Curiosity leads to knowledge, knowledge leads to tolerance, and tolerance\
  \ leads to peace."
