Text: "When I boarded that first plane, I was an anxious mess. Little did I know,\
  \ I\u2019d find myself on this trip. I\u2019d dive into parts of me I\u2019d hidden\
  \ away, and confront the issues that were holding me back.\n\nLittle did I know,\
  \ I\u2019d meet the most inspiring people, most of whom, not so far from the place\
  \ I call home. Little did I know, they were all on the same journey as me.\n\nIt\
  \ was the 30th April 2017 at around 10am in the morning. I\u2019m sat in the window\
  \ seat of a plane shortly departing for Dubai. The man to my left looked at me as\
  \ I sat there trembling with both anticipation and fear of the trip ahead of me.\
  \ I may have only been going for six weeks, but six weeks by myself? Me? I just\
  \ couldn\u2019t picture myself managing it. The man to my left clearly saw that\
  \ tear roll down my cheek as I opened my \u2018Bon Voyage\u2019 cards from family\
  \ and friends with good luck messages. I could\u2019ve done with a \u2018it\u2019\
  ll be okay\u2019 but instead he moved seats. Little did I know, or realise at the\
  \ time, he was giving me the privacy and space I needed alongside the extra seats\
  \ to get some sleep - I just felt alone.\n\nThe plane lands in Dubai, I immediately\
  \ take a seat in B10 where my flight to Australia is due to depart from. A different\
  \ man sits next to me, asks for help with the WiFi and asked if he could take a\
  \ picture with me to show his family who\u2019d helped him. I agreed. Little did\
  \ I know at that moment, the man would then use google translate to try and get\
  \ me to stay in Dubai and get married. Little did I know, that months later, he\u2019\
  d still be creating new Facebook accounts and harassing my loved ones. From that\
  \ moment onwards, I was more careful.\n\nI arrived in Australia to an empty dorm,\
  \ I stayed there until I was so hungry I had to leave and by leave I mean go on\
  \ a Tinder date with a man named Matt I\u2019d never met before. So much for careful\
  \ eh? My trust however was put in the right hands. We walked around Darling Harbour,\
  \ got some food, and little did I know at that moment in time how much he\u2019\
  d share with me that week I was in Sydney. I\u2019d gained a friend for life.\n\n\
  Thailand wasn\u2019t so great, coming down from the high of Australia and the people\
  \ I had met, I felt once again lost and alone. I sat in my hammock wishing there\
  \ was more I knew and someone to share it with.\n\nBali & Lombok gave me the moment\
  \ I\u2019d been waiting for. That sitting on the edge of a cliff reflecting on my\
  \ six weeks watching the waves crash around as the sunsets. Until that moment, little\
  \ did I know I was so lucky.\n\nShortened"
