Text: "The idea of new interaction always striked the inner spirit towards a hungry\
  \ adventure. It is when this flash of light glows and outshines the deep etched\
  \ words \u201CIntercontinental\u201D, the mind couldn\u2019t be silenced further.\
  \ The racing blood was faster than the fastest athlete and the aortic pump beat\
  \ faster than the fastest engine. Certainly, when dreams that were beyond the clouds\
  \ once, now becoming a real entity creates a deeper connection of commitment, this\
  \ one with the soul and Mother Nature. The world is never large for a broken and\
  \ a heart so pure. The world is it\u2019s home. Networking with people from an entirely\
  \ different place who has an entirely different story with a culture of their own\
  \ to share. Humbled among the new winds and sinking into the a land with a history\
  \ of its own. A land where millions have tred on for centuries and you\u2019re previlaged\
  \ to share that with them. Nobody is born a bad person, it\u2019s their way of living\
  \ through their years, situations and circumstances that make them bad. But what\
  \ was once pure will never fade and shall always remain true to its roots in the\
  \ bottom of the heart. Sharing Happiness, Affection, Love and care would not buy\
  \ one lovely pleasures of life but definitely the livelihood of one other humbled\
  \ person sharing this very planet with the individual. We drive through the country\
  \ to meet and greet as many, only to improvise the lives of all those souls a little\
  \ more happier than they already are. Destiny holds what one cannot witness with\
  \ foresight but definitely the very best unexpected surprises that\u2019s always\
  \ bound to turn up at each corner. The aura of the new land is magical, the sun\
  \ shines each day and so does the moon and stars and even the winds that blow across\
  \ and apart. The world might mint a lot of cash for they say \u2018War is good for\
  \ business\u2018 nevertheless it\u2019s not materials that shines the soul cheering\
  \ it to outburst happiness but it\u2019s the feel that tingles and tickles the heart\
  \ that make people want to live for more than they ever did. People may earn a million\
  \ dollars a day but I\u2019d they walk into their domicile with a miserable face,\
  \ weeping all night with no shoulder to share love or pain, I\u2019d say there\u2019\
  s no point to live that way. Happiness wins over satisfaction. Meet and greet new\
  \ people, share everything happy and make this world a better place than it already\
  \ is. Born a kid, very pure at heart, leave a kid, with a same purity of a celebrated\
  \ soul. Humanity, humility, serenity and tranquility."
