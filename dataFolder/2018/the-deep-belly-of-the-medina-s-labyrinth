Text: "\"Watch out for the Medina taxi!\", Nagib our Berber guide chuckled.\n\nWe\
  \ stepped behind another hidden intertwining turn in the Old Medina of Fes. The\
  \ high spirited Nagib was pointing to a donkey.\n\n\"He's the only form of transport\
  \ within these walls,\" he explained as we passed wild Berber chickens displayed\
  \ next to a butcher hanging cuts of camel meat. Proudly hung above each store were\
  \ portraits of the Moroccan King and his family.\n\nI soon learnt that everything\
  \ could be found in the dizzying labyrinth of the Medina. It was like a live game\
  \ of Where's Wally?\n\nTraditional leather tanneries continue practising the ancient\
  \ craft with cow urine and pigeon poop. The colourful dying wells and its craftsmen\
  \ depict a rainbow Kodak moment. Uncaptured from any photo is the unstoppable natural\
  \ smell. Fresh bunches of mint are handed to all visitors, placed under our noses\
  \ to add to tannery experience. The mints are later used in our 'Moroccan whiskies',\
  \ also known as a refreshing strong brew of mint and peppermint tea.\n\nWomen on\
  \ a neighbouring rooftop demonstrated another ancient craft of hand carpet weaving\
  \ on large looms. The Berber carpet creations all tell a different love story with\
  \ each generation adding to the designs. The opposite sides of the carpet tassels\
  \ are purposely mismatched.\n\n\"Our love stories do not end. Here, you see is the\
  \ start and is ongoing at the other end - just like how love is,\" Nagib explained.\
  \ My companion and I smiled. \n\nThe Medina is structured to service different functions.\
  \ The food and cooking quarter were eagerly welcomed by midday. Fresh and exotic\
  \ fragrances wafted into the air.\n\nThe communal bakery's clay oven prepared the\
  \ fresh loaves of bread for the whole Medina community and its families. Each family\
  \ marks their loaves with a unique design as identified by the baker and from its\
  \ ingredients without the need for labels.\n\nDay prayer schedules rang amongst\
  \ the various mosques scattered throughout the Medina as locals practised their\
  \ religious beliefs. Different religions and faiths co-exist as friendly old neighbours\
  \ within the Medina.\n\nOther old continued traditions include herbal medicine and\
  \ skincare. Kernels of argan trees found throughout Morocco are grounded to produce\
  \ argan oil. This is used from cooking to skincare.\n\nWith so many elements to\
  \ explore, it is impossible not to wander off deep into the belly of the labyrinth.\
  \ Getting lost is always a thrill. Getting lost in a Moroccan medina is another\
  \ adventure in itself."
