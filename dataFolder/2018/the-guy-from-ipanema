Text: "We had already been travelling for six weeks. My best friend and company for\
  \ this trip is afraid of flying. Therefore she made me agree on going everywhere\
  \ by public transportation. At this point that meant that we had crossed the South\
  \ American continent twice from east to west and back only using buses. One of the\
  \ longest rides took us almost a full day going from Campo Grande to Rio de Janeiro.\
  \ We were exhausted and tired. The buses tend to stop very frequently which makes\
  \ it hard to get enough sleep. When Rio came closer we just wished for a shower\
  \ and some nice food before lying down. Sweaty, tired and creasy we arrived in our\
  \ hostel. Filthy as we were we stumbled into our room and into a preparation of\
  \ a photo shooting. The model in the middle of the room was surrounded by three\
  \ other girls dressing and making her up. There were clothes, shoes and jewelry\
  \ everywhere. No space for us to lie down or even to place our stuff.  So we decided\
  \ to shower and then head towards the beach. In our very rudimentary Portuguese\
  \ we tried to find our way in the mysterious bus system of Rio and asked for a bus\
  \ to Botafogo Beach. Immediately we were identified as Germans and we had a new\
  \ friend. Dieter was the son of a German couple who immigrated to Brazil before\
  \ his birth. Now in his fifties he had spent most of his live in S\xE3o Paulo and\
  \ Rio except for the time he studied in Munich, the town we were living in. Additionally,\
  \ he worked most of his life as a tour guide. In other words: we were adopted instantly.\
  \ During that day he showed us downtown of Rio and his favorite caf\xE9s, and the\
  \ next days he guided us around the city \u2013 to a sometimes tiring extent: The\
  \ sugar head and the statue of Christ the Redeemer, the area Santa Theresa and the\
  \ famous mosaic stairs, the Copacabana where he played Volleyball, the favela Dona\
  \ Marta where Michael Jackson shot a music video. He had stories about everything.\
  \ And I mean everything. One night he took us out for salsa dancing. In his old\
  \ Ford he picked us up at our hostel. He put Frank Sinatra\u2019s The Girl from\
  \ Ipanema on \u2013 still one of the songs who always bring me back to Rio. He took\
  \ us to this amazing live music club Rio Scenarium, with these old movie requisites\
  \ and people dancing everywhere. When he got tired and had to go we stayed until\
  \ the morning. Every now and then Dieter sends emails updating us with the latest\
  \ news from Rio. Last summer he also came to Germany and Munich and we could give\
  \ a bit of his hospitality back."
