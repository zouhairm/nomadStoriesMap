Text: "The stifling air leaves me gasping for breath and, after weeks in the tropics,\
  \ angrily detesting that I was born with this frizzy mess on top of my head. The\
  \ scorching heat fiercely pierces my skin, yet I\u2019m paralyzed, my chest wound\
  \ tight as a sailors knot; it\u2019s a familiar feeling. Since discovering my significant\
  \ other with another woman weeks earlier, I am destroyed. \u201CWhat am I doing\
  \ here?,\u201D I ask myself.\n\nOn a quiet side street in the heart of Luang Prabang,\
  \ I sit alone on the decrepit cement step in front of my run down hostel. I'm alone,\
  \ in every sense of the word. After a devastating breakup 7,817 km ago, I feel lost,\
  \ empty, and wildly invisible. I glance blankly up the street, lost in my thoughts,\
  \ when I spot the faces of three Lao children peering at me from behind a wall.\n\
  \nThe eldest, \"The Guardian,\" a cheerfully chubby boy of about 8 years; \"The\
  \ Princess,\u201D an adorably charming girl in a \u201CFrozen\u201D dress, and;\
  \ \"The Wild Child\" tot with messy hair and a cheeky grin. The three curiously\
  \ approach me with wonder and caution, the littlest with her arm outstretched to\
  \ reveal a sweet grasped in her tiny hand, offering me a gift. I graciously decline,\
  \ but she insists. I accept, and her eyes light up. She sits next to me, her leg\
  \ pressed against mine, screeching excitedly each time I look at her and smile.\
  \ \"The Princess,\" mesmerised by my hair, brushes and braids it while the boy determinedly\
  \ questions me in Lao, which I regrettably cannot comprehend. We don't understand\
  \ a word of each other\u2019s native tongue, but we don't need to; I already feel\
  \ a bond with them.\n\nOur interaction turns from minutes to hours as we play together\
  \ all day long on the crowded and dusty street in front of their home, their playground.\
  \ We play hide-and-go-seek, hiding quietly behind ragged shop signs and broken fences.\
  \ We take photographs, laughing hysterically while planning whether to strike a\
  \ silly, serious or smiling pose. Our interaction is so pure, so primitive, so -\
  \ real. My mind drifts momentarily as I realize that, without a single word, we\
  \ are communicating through the only true universal language - kindness.\n\nWe sit\
  \ together in harmony on the decrepit cement step. A man approaches on a motorcycle,\
  \ evidently arriving at his home. He shouts to his children in Lao, but even my\
  \ monolingual mind knows that it\u2019s something to the effect of, \"Don't talk\
  \ to strangers, get back in the house!\" and they scurry off never to be seen again.\
  \ If only he knew, we weren't strangers at all."
