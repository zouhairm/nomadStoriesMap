Text: "When crossing over the bridge with the windows of the mega van wide open. The\
  \ sweet salty smell of the seaweed lingers in your nose. As you break into the place\
  \ where you left your heart ten years ago. Not sure what to expect as if watching\
  \ one of your childhood cartoons again. Would it hold up to all the unbridled expectations\
  \ of what one has built it up to be. We have arrived. Instantaneously I find myself\
  \ at home in the san juan islands once again. Wide eyed and bushy tailed reminiscing\
  \ in memories of times thought lost. They were just hiding out of sight waiting\
  \ to be reawakened by a place, a space, a state of mind. An omnipresent essence\
  \ of water thickens the air. The fog rolls in laying clouds down on the archipelago.\
  \ The horizon would be lost in the blue or every hue if not for the islands breaking\
  \ out of the mirrored world of sky and sea. The ferries cross the sound through\
  \ swells that topple over tides as gravity pulls it in and out. Underneath there\
  \ lies another world. One with moving mountains singing to one another that scratch\
  \ their backs on cove beaches before they breach above the glassy surface. It takes\
  \ a careful eye to behold the grace as they move through the water like waves that\
  \ rise and fall. Misunderstood creatures black and white said to be killers. Still\
  \ never having harming a human in there home, the wild. I come here in search of\
  \ them for they have never stopped captivating my imagination. So here we are, pushing\
  \ off from the dock. I am scouring the water with my eyes. Before I know it blow\
  \ holes are the horizon. The orcas have taken over the waves. J, K and L were there\
  \ with a transient pod. They were playing as if no one was watching. Greater acrobats\
  \ then one might assume for there size. Breaching out of the water as if to fly\
  \ splashing you and I. The crowd watching filled with a state of awe. Granny spy\
  \ hopped staring directly at the boat. She was not even 15 feet away. She held herself\
  \ there for what seemed like an eternity. She proceeded to dive into the water coming\
  \ directly at the boat. The guide was so anxious she started doing the jaws anthem\
  \ over the megaphone. Of coarse granny dove under not even a foot away. She was\
  \ the oldest of the resident pods. She did indeed make all of us feel something\
  \ that day. I felt small. Confused unaware of what she new that I didn\u2019t. When\
  \ I went on that tour. I thought I was just gonna see a whale. But I saw a sentient\
  \ being sizing us up. But who am I to know what was behind those eyes."
