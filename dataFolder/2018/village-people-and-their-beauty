Text: "It's been five years now but I still remember this wonderful experience. I\
  \ was 18 years old then, final exams of my high school started and my Dad's health\
  \ weakened. I know how to divert him so I said \"Pa, let my exams finish, we will\
  \ go anywhere you want, do whatever you say be it visiting the best doctor or anything\
  \ else, just let my exams finish.\u2019\u2019  He got excited and said \u201CI would\
  \ like to meet my old relatives lets go to my village instead.\" \nI agreed and\
  \ as soon as my exams ended, we started our journey meeting my father\u2019s far\
  \ relatives whom I haven't met till now and knowing how they are related to me was\
  \ a wonderful experience. As soon as the village started, people usually sitting\
  \ outside their homes started staring at us from the point where they saw us to\
  \ the point where they can't see us anymore it felt like we are a VIP to everyone\
  \ around.\nTo ask for the address I called a person nearby, he came running and\
  \ told us the address as if showing the way to a treasure island, such was hospitality.\
  \ We reached my uncle's place and he gave us a warm welcome. As they both went to\
  \ his home I said I'll go around this beautiful place for a walk. \nI saw a bunch\
  \ of women carrying water in pots on their heads. As I saw them they looked eagerly\
  \ waiting for me to start the conversation. I started \"So, you people carry water\
  \ like this every day?\" in Telugu, it\u2019s the regional language of the place\
  \ where I live. They felt a bit shy to answer but somehow replied \"Yes, once in\
  \ two days\" as soon as she said that another women asked me, \"whom did you came\
  \ to meet here?\" As I was giving answer another women asked same kind of question,\
  \ and within no time they felt comfortable talking to me. We talked and talked till\
  \ it was sunset, surprisingly the surrounding people also joined and started asking\
  \ me questions just for talking to me. I felt like a play school teacher as some\
  \ kids were bringing drawing books from their huts and showing to me, women asking\
  \ if I would like to have Tea and what not! I didn\u2019t stop talking for a wide\
  \ gap, I was speaking about something or the other like how different city life\
  \ is, how peaceful and healthy those people in villages live, Tollywood etc. Everything\
  \ we talked about felt like an interesting thing to share.\nI believe making a local\
  \ connection helps in knowing whats common in people across the word and this connection\
  \ makes travelling seem timeless, work gets done in between conversations and most\
  \ importantly life becomes much easy."
