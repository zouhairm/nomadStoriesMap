Text: "When you're in Amsterdam, you want to get a bicycle. We wanted to get a bicycle,\
  \ but it was too expensive to rent one. We were just two students from Russia, our\
  \ biggest expenses located in the local coffee shops. \n    So we were sitting on\
  \ the bench in the park, smoking a joint and envying all these people who were cycling\
  \ in front of our red eyes. In Amsterdam, not so many people walk. They can cycle\
  \ or run. We couldn't run.\n    We were tired and I wanted a fish burger. I like\
  \ fish and Holland has it's own famous fish dishes. A Cheap one is fish burgers.\
  \ But they were hiding from me. Right around the corner. So we stood up from the\
  \ bench and left the park. \n- Hey, guys! Why don't you have a bicycle? - asked\
  \ us a long-grey hair old man in the long coat.\nIt was the question of the last\
  \ two days.\n- Do you want some?\nIn Amsterdam, they have already offered us coke\
  \ and sex but we've refused. And they finally offered us something useful.\n- May\
  \ be, - we started bargaining. - How much?\n- 10 for this one, - and he pointed\
  \ at the old-style bicycle with big wheels.\n- Hm. We don't know.\n- Do you need\
  \ a second one? Smaller one?\n- Yeah, may be.\n- OK. Take them for 15. But we have\
  \ to take a walk. Take this one and let's go.\nMy friend who is bigger than me,\
  \ take this bicycle and roll. He is not a good cyclist so he was trying to get a\
  \ balance and do not fall. I went near the Amsterdam guy. \n- It's so expensive\
  \ to rent and everybody is cycling here. So I knew you'll need a bicycle.\n- Where\
  \ from do you take them?\n- I stole it. And I've seen a small one which will fit\
  \ you really well. So I'll steal it for you.\n- Oh. You're like Robin Hood. You're\
  \ stealing from rich ones who can afford a bicycle and give them to poor us.\n-\
  \ Yeah. Something like that, - he grinned.\nHe was an old hippy. With kind blue\
  \ eyes which had drown in the drugs and alcohol. He suddenly stopped. My friend\
  \ finally felt.\n- Wait for me here, - said Robin Hood and disappeared in the dark\
  \ back street.\nAfter five minutes our new friend rolled from the other back street.\
  \ He was really beautiful on the bicycle. Long hair, long coat on the wind. \n-\
  \ Let's go guys. Police are looking for me.\nWe ran after him. Crossed the big street\
  \ with trams and he jumped off the bicycle.\n- Take it.\n- Thank you very much.\
  \ \nWe gave him money for bicycles and he disappeared.\nAfter two days somebody\
  \ stole one of our bicycles in Rotterdam. So we threw the other one into the river\
  \ from the Erasmus bridge."
