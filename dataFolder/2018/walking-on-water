Text: '"The Zanskar tries to take your life once during the trek. If you survive,
  nature will protect you forever"

  - Ropchek, Resident of Leh


  Leh, a small city in the Indian part of the Himalayas, is visited every year by
  a large number of people who love the spirituality of the Himalayas or for the thrill
  of biking across the most treacherous road in the world. However, in winters, the
  only people that one could spot in leh are either the ones that love their home
  too much to leave it for something as trivial as -30 Degrees Celcius, or the people
  who plan to take up the Chadar trek. I belong to the second category.

  The Chadar trek takes place in the months of December, January and February. Known
  as one of the toughest trek in the world and the toughest trek in the country, it
  is a 111km trek that involves walking uphill on the frozen Zanskar river. After
  I got to know that there was a chance that the government might ban the trek because
  its too dangerous to be an adventure sport, there was little that could stop me
  from signing up for it. Three months of hitting the gym gave me the confidence if
  not the strenght to complete it.'
