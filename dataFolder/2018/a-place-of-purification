Text: "Last december, i found myself under an unblemished cerulean sky in the northeastern\
  \ hills of Cherrapunji,Meghalaya,India. The breeze carried the exhilarating sound\
  \ of  rush from somewhere in the distance. The next day, we headed towards our trekking\
  \ spot where we found people from different regions with the ideal motive as us,\
  \ to tear off the thirst of wanderlust and enthusiastic towards reaching 'Double\
  \ Decker',a living root bridge. It was a 3000 steps journey down the hill towards\
  \ Nongriat village and we were rushing as we had a little time to get back before\
  \ sunset. As we walked through the stairways and steeped paths, large swathes of\
  \ houses on the hills sprung into view. We followed the directions recommended by\
  \ the passersby ascending us, hearing one after another that we are already halfway,\
  \ gave our energy some boosts.\nAfter descending through steps, we came across two\
  \ hanging bridges. The bridges were made of iron cables supported with bamboo with\
  \ some parts attached with steel wires. As we started walking through the bridge,\
  \ it started shaking slidely, and i could hear the sounds of the the water flowing\
  \ below and my chanting 'Om Namah Shivaya' soon followed. This experience actually\
  \ made my fear vanish away. \n\n              Reaching Double Decker,the nip in\
  \ the air had turned into something deliciously cold. It couldnot have been more\
  \ perfect. The serene place, the two naturally built root bridges with the water\
  \ flowing below it, were the best of all sight seeing. The bridges are trained by\
  \ khasi tribes in such a way as to form bridges, entangled with roots.I didn't feel\
  \ the need to stir out of the comfort of that newly found phenomenal. In a swoop,i\
  \ regenerated my strength. It is blessed with extraordinary natural beauty. All,\
  \ as i discovered,were excellent. On our way back , we found the path lit up by\
  \ the houses on the sideways.  It was already dark;other tourists were also exhausted\
  \ lamenting the distance and on the other hand appreciating the beauty of that arena.\
  \ If the place was to die for, the night sky was another beast,billowing with stars\
  \ and giving us the slightest encouragement to spend some quality time more.\n\n\
  \                 The 3 km trek from Tyrna to Nongriat might seem foreboding to\
  \ most but for a nature lover it is the beginning of an unforgettable journey to\
  \ an equally unforgettable destination."
