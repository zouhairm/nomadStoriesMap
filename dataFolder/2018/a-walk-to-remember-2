Text: "\u201CDo you want to experience the real Gaddi culture?\u201D Ramu asked me\
  \ while we sat on the banks of Gaj River sipping \u2018garam chai\u2019 at Bal Gaon.\n\
  \n\u201CBut how?\u201D I asked, after tossing hundreds of questions about Gaddi\
  \ culture. I stood up emptying my cup of chai and throwing a pebble into the river.\n\
  \n\u201CYou can be my guest today, I\u2019m poor but you could be one of us tonight,\u201D\
  \ he said showing his only eyeball.\n\n\u201CYou think I would mind? But one condition,\
  \ I get to taste desi arrack tonight. Deal?\u201D I screamed in joy, expecting an\
  \ echo.\n\nRamu tossed me my trekking pole saying we need to hike two hours to reach\
  \ Kadhi Behi, a quaint village with no bus connection, mobile networks, or toilets,\
  \ but not short of love and affection.\n\nWe ascended steep hills one after another\
  \ while he narrated the story of how he lost his left eye by a bear attack during\
  \ a pilgrimage to \u2018Lamb Dal\u2019. \u201CYou walk like one of us despite being\
  \ one from the plains\u201D, Ramu pulled my leg. I told him, I\u2019m an engineer\
  \ by brains but a mountain boy at heart.\n\nRamu picked his kid from school, a barren\
  \ shelter with a name plank at least 10 years old. Ramu\u2019s son, Vishesh, looked\
  \ puzzled, so was I looking at the state of education in villages. Ramu went on\
  \ explaining the hardships he faced being a daily wage laborer, walking 20 kilometres\
  \ a day to make a living. He plucked \u201CBicchu Buti\u201D in the forest, a poisonous\
  \ herb that causes itching but tastes delicious when cooked with spices.\n\nI was\
  \ awestruck at the sight of those landscapes as we approached his home. Kadhi Behi\
  \ is a small settlement in Himachal Pradesh, inhabited by Gaddi tribe. Gaddis are\
  \ shepherds who wander with their herds independent of urban civilization apart\
  \ from salt and kerosene. I was served tea and a half packet of biscuits which Vishesh\
  \ handed to me panting for breath, running from his neighbor\u2019s home. I was\
  \ soul searching seeing the setting sun and watched Ramu\u2019s daughter Priyanka\
  \ picking her lamb from barley terrace fields. \n\nRamu's wife served dinner in\
  \ the kitchen for all of us. It was a rustic culinary feast of Makki Roti, Bicchu\
  \ Buti Saag and desi arrack as per the deal. I got out of the kitchen to see the\
  \ sky illuminated with stars and wiped tears from my eyes. I was offered the only\
  \ room in the shed house while they slept in the kitchen. \n\nI felt like \u2018\
  Papillon\u2019 trying to escape urban reality while Ramu was a \u2018Louis Dega\u2019\
  \ trapped in rural nightmares. I played peekaboo with Vishesh, putting him to sleep\
  \ but for me, the night was longer."
