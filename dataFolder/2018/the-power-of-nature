Text: "Along the side of Marina Pez Vela docks, we meet our tour guide, who will be\
  \ showing us around Manuel Antonio \u2013 a small ocean village on the central Pacific\
  \ coast of Costa Rica \u2013 by jet ski. My friend and I share one for $160 and\
  \ take turns maneuvering it. Neither of us has ever been on one. High on adrenaline\
  \ and fear, we struggle to control it through the waves, but through trial and error\
  \ on the gas, we finally get the hang of it.\n\nOur aqua adventure includes a glimpse\
  \ of a family of dolphins diving in and out of the sea. We press on the gas with\
  \ excitement and chase after them, jet skiing from a safe distance beside them.\
  \ As we skim further through the ocean, we see water spouting upwards into the air.\
  \ A whale! We pursue it and seconds later we see its precious calf. Witnessing them\
  \ in their element is incredible.\n\nI don\u2019t want to leave, but our guide signals\
  \ for us to head back. Halfway there, we tie our jet skis to a buoy by a secluded\
  \ bay at Playa Biesanz. He hands us snorkeling gear and gives us a few minutes to\
  \ explore.\n\nThe ocean terrifies me \u2013 being in the middle of open water, nowhere\
  \ close to land. I\u2019m not a strong swimmer. I can dog paddle, but not for long.\
  \ Somehow with the life vest on and the calm water, it eases some of my fears. Yet,\
  \ as I put on the snorkeling gear, my heart races and I breathe heavily. It feels\
  \ weird. The mask suffocates my nose from oxygen. How does this work?\n\n\u201C\
  Breathe through your mouth,\u201D Cassandra advises as she swims away. \n\nI try\
  \ breathing through the tube with my mouth. Ok, not so bad, I say to myself. I edge\
  \ over the jet ski and slowly slide into the warm ocean. I struggle a bit as I kick\
  \ my feet in the water and dog paddle my way. I dip my face in and can\u2019t see\
  \ anything but sea green water. I swim further in frog style and finally see them.\
  \ Yellow, grayish tropical fish everywhere! Swarms of various sizes of school of\
  \ fish are circling around as I swim towards them.\n\nIn that moment \u2013 surrounded\
  \ by all the biodiversity \u2013 the long hours at the office, sitting in front\
  \ of a computer and the restriction from being trapped indoors is nothing but a\
  \ faint memory. Thankful for being able to experience all the natural beauty Costa\
  \ Rica offers, I am content. Life is about living freely, happily and being content.\
  \ Pura Vida. I understand now why all the local Ticos (Costa Ricans) live by it."
