Text: "The roads in Phnom Penh were peculiar. A part of the National Highway was marshy\
  \ and smelled like raindrops. We drove right next to Mekong River. The July morning\
  \ sun was fiercely flamboyant above our heads. The air here was a little drier than\
  \ in Vietnam. And quieter. And more depressing. Yet the Mekong still stayed the\
  \ same. The vast thick red river was so sheen that it could not reflect the banana\
  \ clusters covering the horizon.\n\nIt was eight forty-five. I turned on our van\u2019\
  s radio to listen to the interview of Kem Ley, a very well-known politician and\
  \ social activist. Those days, the report \u201CHostile Takeovers,\u201D which unveiled\
  \ the family business tree of Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen, flooded everywhere,\
  \ and Kem Ley was asked to give opinions on this. Being very neutral and transparent,\
  \ he directly condemned the government of Hun Sen blatantly corrupting the country\u2019\
  s economy.\n\nIt seemed that Cambodia and Vietnam were as distinguished from each\
  \ other as the two sides of Mekong river. Cambodia is a multi-party body with activists\
  \ like Kem Ley who publicly criticized the system and a Prime Minister who has been\
  \ in power for thirty-three years, while Vietnam is a single-party government with\
  \ two-term presidency limit and no journalistic freedom where the authorities employ\
  \ physical and legal harassment to critical reporters. Yet, in a wide understanding,\
  \ we both have the so-called \u201Cdemocracy.\u201D\n\nI stared at the river beside.\
  \ Maybe we did not only share the Mekong, but also that democratic mask. We seem\
  \ to be very different on the surface, yet the dictatorial alluvial from the river\
  \ had deeply soaked into our soil and made us the same. The actual voice of people\
  \ had never been understood.\nIt was nine ten. Our van passed Monivong Boulevard.\
  \ The tuk-tuk drivers biked like hunchbacks, the hawkers merchandised little souvenirs,\
  \ and everything was so uneventful. Until an explosion sounded far away. Something\
  \ like a gunshot.\n\nPeople frantically ran out to the street. I got down the van\
  \ and blended into the crowd. When we finally knew what happened, I could never\
  \ forget how many people froze on the street and their grimace of dismay, disappointment,\
  \ and hopelessness.\n\nKem Ley just got assassinated in front of the gas station\
  \ we just drove by.\n\nThe crowd behind us moaned and argued, but there was an empty\
  \ road in front of my eyes. It was as blank as our freedom of speech and the future\
  \ when we could finally have the right to speak for the truth and demand justice."
