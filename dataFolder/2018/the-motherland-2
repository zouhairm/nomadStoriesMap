Text: "The anti-depressants were not enough, so I\u2019d dragged Ria away from a grey\
  \ winter at home, to a girls\u2019 trip in India, my motherland, in the hope that\
  \ the country would lend my friend some of its color. \n\nWe had been here for three\
  \ weeks, and progress was proving slow. \n\nTwo years ago, Ria had been the victim\
  \ of a terrible theft. This woman, once the most nurturing and lively I had known,\
  \ had put up walls, living in an inert and non-reactive new equilibrium where she\
  \ did not give and did not take. She was a broken TV stuck on the same monochromatic\
  \ channel of a droning daily routine. \n\nDusk was drifting in, and I\u2019d just\
  \ scoffed half a dozen phuchhkas. Ria had stopped after one. She rarely had an appetite\
  \ these days. In search of a good spot to watch the sunset, we\u2019d fled from\
  \ the constant angry conversations of vehicle horns into a quieter side-street,\
  \ where mosquitoes hummed over the gutters. Outside their houses, there were groups\
  \ of women draped in turmeric- and chili-colored saris, chatting with their golden\
  \ bangles clattering down to slender, tanned wrists. Past them, a group of children\
  \ were playing cricket at the end of the street. \n\nStraying from the group was\
  \ a small girl, no more than four or five, in a tattered dress, with greasy hair\
  \ and smudges of dirt on her face. Small metal bells tinkled about her ankles as\
  \ she approached looking for food. I glanced guiltily at my leather jacket; a useless\
  \ luxury in the face of need. The tang of tamarind water was still on my tongue,\
  \ but I had no more left to share. \n \nThe child wasn't interested in me. She was\
  \ giggling and running towards Ria like she was an old friend. Ria knelt and fished\
  \ out her untouched portion of phuchhka from her bag. The girl\u2019s smiling teeth\
  \ shone brightly against her dark skin as she rushed back to the group to share\
  \ her prize. \n\nIt could have been my imagination, but I thought I saw a slight\
  \ pink tinge to Ria\u2019s cheeks and a wet sheen to her eyes as we walked past\
  \ the children, beyond the street into the last of the sun\u2019s warmth. \n\nOur\
  \ shadows lengthened behind us as I contemplated the traumas that formed Ria\u2019\
  s armour; this single mother who had seen her only child pass before her, too old\
  \ to birth again.  Eventually, I broke the silence. \n\n\"Have you considered adoption?\"\
  \n\nShe turned to look at me with a rare crooked-toothed smile, as if to say I\u2019\
  d read her mind. In it, there was the hope that she might find herself again, and\
  \ it was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen."
