Text: "Every journey begins where it starts. I mean place of departure, that is a\
  \ witness of my expectations before and of my emotions after. So, I'm writing this\
  \ in Tashkent, picking notorious moments from my Russian trip. It is not about sights\
  \ I've seen or historical facts I've known. You can access a great deal of that\
  \ stuff on the internet. \n     While we were in Moscow, my relative proposed to\
  \ give us  a ride and an excursion in Sergiev Posad, town famous for its magnificent\
  \ temples.  The ironic thing is that relative is a complete atheist. The road from\
  \ Moscow to Sergiev Posad typically takes 3-4 hours. I'll never forget the picture\
  \ of Nikolay II, known for his horrific death, on a huge poster with \"Forgive us,\
  \ tsar\" inscription at the bottom, on our way to the destination. Forgiveness from\
  \ a dead person for actions neither you nor your generation committed is a peak\
  \ of illogicality. \n    Woohoo, we finally found free parking spot and came out\
  \ to commence our sightseeing. Pigeons. Innocent armies of them were filling the\
  \ air, as in many European countries. I've seen a plenty of aggressive pigeons abusing\
  \ their mates for sake of food. However, it didn't affect my belief that pigeons\
  \ are pure and clean symbols of peace.  My Christian aunt put her shawl on, what\
  \ in magic way made her completely unknown for me. I was annoyed by the stranger\
  \ woman following us until I discovered the truth. \n     I looked at beautiful\
  \ temples, wondering how flawless their architecture is. Even photos taken in tilted\
  \ or falling style did not distort the symmetry of gorgeous shapes. It was merely\
  \ a small church, quite unnoticeable among pompous buildings. The priest was standing\
  \ there near the candles, telling something I could not hear to people approaching\
  \ him. I supposed things he was talking about was a bare propaganda. But.. I don't\
  \ know what exactly happened to me next. The church was quite small and plain in\
  \ comparison to those I had already seen. I was just astonished by its neatness,\
  \ preciseness, shivering. It was not feeling of faith for sure. I admired the art.\
  \ Now, I'm contemplating, what is art? What is in it so magnetizing and appealing\
  \ in it? I guess, or even know, or even assert that it is something extending beyond\
  \ aspect of external features. If I ever doubted the existence of inner world in\
  \ inanimate subjects, I no longer doubt. There is a soul of the creator(s) forever\
  \ living inside, and showing up to those who is open to everything bright and new."
