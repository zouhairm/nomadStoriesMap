Text: "Andes, the longest on earth range of mystic peaks, just above or just below\
  \ the puffiness of clouds. Inhabited by surprisingly staring lamas and their lonely\
  \ shepherds. Bolivian Andes are even more rough, with a more intensive feeling of\
  \ remoteness and authenticity stretching across the horizon.\n\nIt is off season\
  \ November, but we barely saw any rain. Lucky us. 4 days trekking around a Condor\
  \ winglike massif, with two days on the ridge of resistance, made us strong enough\
  \ to enter the phase of even higher goals. \n\nIt is half past midnight. Swishing\
  \ sound from outside reminds it is time to wake up. Is it a wind, or a guide putting\
  \ his gear on in the neighbouring, rustling tent? I try not to be surprised by the\
  \ difficulty I have with standing up. We are in Campo Alto, 5500 meters above sea\
  \ level, which is not an altitude that could be handled by everyone. As we wake\
  \ up, I am getting worried again about altitude sickness encountered during Condoriri\
  \ trek. I am also thinking about my own ability to reach our goal. Illimani, this\
  \ is how the second biggest mountain of Bolivia is called. 6438 m visible from La\
  \ Paz, a symbol of the city and my personal symbol of the decision I have made.\
  \ Only 3 months passed after I decided to break up with my fiancee, and 3 years\
  \ after I have met my current partner - Pawel and my mountaineering passion. I want\
  \ to prove it to him, but mainly to myself, that I am strong enough. \n\nAs we start\
  \ walking up, breathing deeply and roped tightly, illumination of La Paz lights\
  \ gives a warm sense of security or home proximity, waiting somewhere down the valley.\
  \ I am stunned by our guide skills and scared by the deepness and darkness of Illimani\
  \ crevasses. We communicate with each other in Spanish, using only words that are\
  \ really required. Past 5AM we all get cold and exhausted, but the feel of warm\
  \ sun rays on our faces gives us additional motivation. The snow gets deeper, the\
  \ slope gets steeper and every single step gets harder, but the closer to the peak,\
  \ the more strength I find in my body. As we reach the summit, I remind myself all\
  \ the stories about scarified children I heard the other day from our host in La\
  \ Paz. We look at our frozen faces and congratulate each other. \n\n\u2018Polish\
  \ machines!\u2019 the guide shouts happily and tells us that no one managed to reach\
  \ the summit since early September. We are half conscious but feel extremely successful\
  \ and start our long descent."
