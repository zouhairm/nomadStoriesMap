Text: "\u201CWoher kommst du?\u201D\n\nI furrowed my brow. An ingenuous yet direct\
  \ question. From the front seat of his taxi Senol had asked me \u201CWhere do you\
  \ come from?\u201D. At first I was taken aback by the informality of his interrogation.\
  \ In Germany it is customary to address an unfamiliar person with \u2018Sie\u2019\
  \ rather than \u2018du\u2019. A trivial observation perhaps, but after years of\
  \ being schooled to use the formal address, it felt somewhat unexpected. I paused.\n\
  \nOstensibly extroverted and self-assured, very few questioned my decision to forsake\
  \ the comfort of my London home for the allure of Berlin. The concrete jungle. A\
  \ city renowned for liberalism yet unequivocally candid about it\u2019s sordid past.\
  \ Austere. Exuberant. Conflicted. A cornucopia of expression yet also preserved\
  \ as a harrowing memento to atrocities of man.\n\nWith a considerable understanding,\
  \ but by no means command of the German language, I anticipated an easy transition.\
  \ Initially I gawked with starry-eyed bewilderment at the sprawling city before\
  \ me. Despondent post-communist edifices granted new life by radiant murals. Mundane\
  \ offices rejuvenated by enigmatic individuals sporting rainbow-coloured hair. Each\
  \ new encounter afforded exhilaration and with new-found companions, I embraced\
  \ the city as my own. Yet as the weeks passed by, the elation began to dull. By\
  \ no means all-encompassing, but ever present, I became increasingly aware of a\
  \ festering anxiety developing within. In a city with so much energy and vivacity,\
  \ I felt drained. \n\n\u201CWoher kommst du?\u201D Senol repeated himself. \n\n\
  Startled, I replied: \u201CAus England. Und du?\u201D, returning the question. He\
  \ began to regale me with his journey from Kozan, South Turkey to Berlin. He spoke\
  \ of his family, a wife and two boys back in Turkey, of his previous life and how\
  \ he had adapted to the German culture. I smiled. Tentatively, I asked if he considered\
  \ Berlin as home. He chuckled proclaiming: \u201CTurkey will always be my home but\
  \ home is also a feeling!\u201D\n\nStepping out onto a street corner in Friedrichshain\
  \ I hesitated, musing on Senol\u2019s response. I peered down at my watch. 08:05.\
  \ Rush hour. A young man approaches me asking for directions to Gabriel-Max-Stra\xDF\
  e. Without hesitation, I respond fluently in German giving detailed directions.\
  \ I grinned. Feeling fully unencumbered, I considered everything that I had achieved.\
  \ I think of how familiar this place feels, the friends I\u2019ve made, fond memories\
  \ I\u2019ve created. \n\nHome. Not quite, but it\u2019s certainly beginning to feel\
  \ a lot like one."
