Text: "We were in the end of 2013, the year in which I would discover the course of\
  \ my life, because I expected the result of the vestibular I had tried. As apprehensive\
  \ as I was, my parents and brothers trusted me and were optimistic about the results.\
  \ They said,\u201D I know you're hardworking, I know you'll do it\u201D. I'll never\
  \ know if they just said it out of their mouths or if they really believed it, the\
  \ fact was that I myself had doubts. The fear of that it does not happen, or my\
  \ dream does not come true, simply, does not leave my mind.My parents noticed this,\
  \ they realized that my behavior was different and that much of that change was\
  \ a responsibility of the pressure I put on myself. So they not only realized it,\
  \ but also made the decision to do something about it.\nThey wanted to take us on\
  \ a trip. The essential questions was, how? When? With which money? In this time,\
  \ between means and daydreams, the idea simply appeared. Like in a commercial of\
  \ the decolar.com (except for the fact that we were going by car) everyone said\
  \ out loud \"Let's go to Florian\xF3polis\". Capital city of the Santa Catarina\
  \ state, southern region of Brazil. My father knew a friend who had a friend who\
  \ lived in Florian\xF3polis, this compeer had the reputation of being loveable and\
  \ of being a great host. Well, we all thought it was worth trying, it would was\
  \ a family adventure. We followed, then, arrived, at dawn on December 27th, 2013.\
  \ We stayed there until 5th January.\nDuring the 31st december I could not stop\
  \ thinking that the trip was being wonderful, it would not end there ( the followings\
  \ day was amazing), but it could be over, I would be satisfied already. Going to\
  \ Florianopolis was not a fascinating experience due only to its natural beauties,\
  \ I would say it was the whole set of the work. However, certainly something that\
  \ made this trip even more special, meaning the people we met, from on the road\
  \ to the guest named Noel whom received us as a Santa Claus, because if we observe\
  \ with caution, we may realize that each one passed for our life during the trip\
  \ made a contribution, big or small. I will remember each one forever, we made a\
  \ connection.  Without them I would not have taken the best ice cream, or gone the\
  \ prettiest beach, much less I would see the fires that would start exploding in\
  \ 5, 4, 3.2, 1 ... \u201CHappy new year! \". Nearly five years have passed, Noel\
  \ and his family have become close family friends, have visited us twice over this\
  \ years."
