Text: "I woke up to the roar of the car\u2019s engine and my friend\u2019s childish\
  \ laughter after a storm of \u2018lepes\u2019\u2014a Venezuelan way of branding\
  \ a usually friendly but not-so-gentle slap in the back of the head\u2014thundered\
  \ my skull. As I opened my eyes, blurry colors started to form recognizable, but\
  \ unfamiliar images: tall pine trees, a huge mountain range, and a vast lakeshore,\
  \ all covered in silky snow. I stepped out of the car to see Juan\u2019s grin mocking\
  \ my pain. \u2018Gotcha!\u2019\u2014He smiled. A thick formation of thread-shaped\
  \ clouds crowned the misty skies of Rascafr\xEDa. Our destination: Cascada del Purgatorio.\n\
  \n\u2018This hike ain\u2019t going to be easy\u2019\u2014warned Jes\xFAs. Shortly\
  \ after, the five of us: the Perez brothers, Fico, Andr\xE9s and I, ventured into\
  \ the wild. Everything was new to me, from the majestic, foreign landscape, to the\
  \ feeling of my hiking boots carving their way through the snow. It definitely didn\u2019\
  t feel like sand, that\u2019s for sure. Jes\xFAs laughed as he made fun of my confused\
  \ expression. The two of us had stayed behind while the rest of the group led the\
  \ way. \u2018Don\u2019t you miss the warmth?\u2019 he asked. I replied with a silent\
  \ nod. \u2018I\u2019m glad you could make it, though. I thought I\u2019d never see\
  \ you again\u2019. I suspected the same. \u2018I hope the rest of our friends and\
  \ family can make it out, too\u2019\u2014he continued. I didn\u2019t answer verbally.\
  \ Instead, I let out a nostalgic sigh. \u2018Things will get better\u2019\u2014\
  I assured. \u2018We got to work hard in the meanwhile. It\u2019s our duty as Venezuelans\u2019\
  . He replied with a smile: \u2018an unmistakable optimist. You haven\u2019t changed,\
  \ huh?\u2019 \n\nA year had passed since I was forced to leave my home. The frosty\
  \ Valley of Lozoya served as a beautiful reminder, but not because it was arrayed\
  \ in a wintry dress, or because of the lip-cracking bursts of air gliding through\
  \ the mountains, but because I could walk around nature in peace; not feeling crippling\
  \ fear. \n\nThe sky cleared up. As we reached a glade near the river, we made camp.\
  \ I took off my shirt excitedly; ready to dive in. Everybody looked at me like I\
  \ was mad. \u2018This isn\u2019t the Caribbean, dude!\u2019\u2014Juan declared.\
  \ Well, duh. I dipped my hand into the water and sat back for a while. I felt overwhelming\
  \ gratitude. Then, I turned to my friends, and I waved them goodbye as I let myself\
  \ fall into the river. Like tiny icicles, the water pierced through my skin. \u2018\
  What\u2019s with this guy?\u2019 asked Fico, just as Juan and Jes\xFAs pushed him\
  \ into the water. Rascals.\n\nSure, Spain didn\u2019t feel like home just yet. However,\
  \ in time, I knew it would."
