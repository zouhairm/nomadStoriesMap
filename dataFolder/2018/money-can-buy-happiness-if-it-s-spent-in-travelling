Text: "I truly believe that travelling is not just going on a trip to get your Instagram\
  \ pictures and to show off your enviable trips. It\u2019s about making that place\
  \ your own, and try to feel as local as you can.Getting out of your comfort zone\
  \ is essential to enjoy and truly appreciate a city. That\u2019s what I could experienced\
  \ in my trip to Morocco \n \nI usually travel with my family, but they weren\u2019\
  t convinced about Morocco. I really wanted to go,so, a year ago, I planned a one-week\
  \ trip to Marrakech. This was going to be my first time as a solo traveller. I booked\
  \ my flight tickets, my hostels and a 3-day desert tour, and at that time my adventure\
  \ began.\n \nWhen I first arrived at Marrakech Airport, I felt this was going to\
  \ be an enriching experience in every aspect. After spending 2 hours at the passport\
  \ control, I was heading to the Medina in a crowded bus with my bag. My first WOW\
  \ moment was the Jemma el-Fnaa square, where I could immerse myself within little\
  \ shop stands, snake charmers and locals offering me whatever they could sell.\n\
  \ \nMy first and toughest task was to get to the hostel through the maze of the\
  \ Medina. My first thoughts were \u201CWhat have I done?\u201D\u201CDid I make the\
  \ right choice?\u201D as I got easily lost and I couldn\u2019t find my hostel until\
  \ an hour and half later. Today I can say it was the best decision I have ever taken.\n\
  \nIn Morocco you can learn that the uncommon is not weird or bad, what is not common\
  \ for you, is normal for others. Also you can enjoy the pleasure hidden in every\
  \ little experience, like wandering around Marrakech souk, sitting yourself with\
  \ a bunch of locals to have breakfast in a cafeteria or have a mint tea at a terrace\
  \ while you can read and hear the Adhan (the islamic call to worship). \n \nThe\
  \ sunsets in Marrakech were magic, you could watch the sun fade away and leaving\
  \ a totally different city, a city invaded by the night where you can still be amazed\
  \ by Marrakech's charm. Above all, the best it could offer was the food, in their\
  \ typical Tajines, where the mixture of tastes was unbelievable, totally mouth watering\
  \ new tastes. \n \nAfter enjoying Marrakech it was time for the desert. While getting\
  \ there, I had many unanswered worries, but I just relaxed, and always thought \u201C\
  Get out of your comfort zone, this is good for you\u201D.As we head to the dunes\
  \ riding on camels, I knew all the money spent and the insecurities were worth it.Appreciating\
  \ the sunset, then the full stars sky, totally made me want to come back to Morocco\
  \ in the future."
