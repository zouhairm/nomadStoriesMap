Text: "One of the streets is better than the other. Both have queens. Neighbors around\
  \ town prepare for a battle of four days and six nights to state its supremacy.\
  \ This, the plot of a true tragedy, is exaggerated so don\u2019t be fooled by the\
  \ show: hate is fake and no one wins.\nWhen I came back my life had been changed.\
  \ It was the world\xB4s most erratic situation. The Carnival in Panama has a little\
  \ bit of everyone\xB4s heart.  It get\u2019s out of control like a fresh new teenager.\
  \ \nI went where it was first born, Las Tablas, in the province of Los Santos. People\
  \ from all five continents are mixed as locals.  This small town becomes heaven\
  \ and hell. Those days it's divided in two sectors: \u201CCalle Abajo\u201D and\
  \ \u201CCalle Arriba\u201D. \nThere is no time to sleep and nobody wants to either.\
  \ Girls and boys, men and women going to the \u201Cculecos\u201D wearing peculiar\
  \ outfits where they dance intensely under the burning summer sun. Organizers shower\
  \ them with fresh water falling like rain from hoses attached to tank cars. Walking\
  \ the pavement early in the morning or late in the night are sellers with all kinds\
  \ of hats, sunglasses, cigarettes, beers and more. The \u201Cfondas\u201D blasting\
  \ the typical \u201Cfrituras\u201D. The \u201Cchinitos\u201D, so called mini markets,\
  \ filled with everything you could ever need. Music never stops. Even at night with\
  \ the most amazing carriages, dashing dresses that cost thousands of dollars, queens\
  \ and princesses and the \u201Cpind\xECn\u201D pounding, it's overwhelming, however,\
  \ very necessary. It is the cold you must bear to be able to see the Aurora Boreal\
  \ or the pain you have to feel to get into de Olympics. The Carnival is an existential\
  \ crisis of a middle-aged man\nFor the first time in my life I witnessed this. Las\
  \ Tablas was the forbidden fruit. I wanted to know more. It has the lowest rate\
  \ in economic gross domestic product of my country; it has dry lands and little\
  \ population because of emigration. The streets are old as tales and its highest\
  \ income through the year is this short spasm in time, achieved with fun and respect\
  \ for traditions. I became familiar with it. \nThere were no ups or downs, no hours,\
  \ no responsibilities, no doubts. It was a dome. People were on their most relaxed\
  \ state ever. Everything was unimaginable, unrealistically possible and completely\
  \ insane. Fun and chaos. I came back proud, bruised, exhausted and in love with\
  \ the feeling of being part of the most unspeakable, yet perfectly known face of\
  \ Panamanian culture."
