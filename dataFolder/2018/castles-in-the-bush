Text: "One of my son\u2019s dreams when he grows up is to be a knight. \n\nOn a recent\
  \ road trip to Victoria we decided to keep the dream alive a little bit longer and\
  \ paid a visit to Kryal Castle (he\u2019ll find out soon enough that being a knight\
  \ is not really a viable 21st century career move). \n\nKryal Castle is one of those\
  \ rare monuments to one man\u2019s vision \u2013 a replica medieval castle built\
  \ in the undulating hills just outside of Ballarat. \n\nThe look on our son\u2019\
  s face as we drove up was worth the 12 hour trek down the coast alone. \n\nHe was\
  \ nearly delirious with excitement.\n\nFrom the dragon and castle-themed playground\
  \ to the jousting tournament between the good-hearted Red Knight and the evil Black\
  \ Knight, he was in awe. \n\nThe how-to be-a-knight workshop turned out to be a\
  \ young man in a slightly dubious Game of Thrones-inspired outfit handing out foam\
  \ swords to boys and girls and encouraging them to beat each other up. \n\nThere\
  \ were tears...but I think everyone had a good time pretending to be valiant (or\
  \ evil) knights of the realm.\n      \nOur young daughter loved getting lost in\
  \ the stone maze. She took off, delighting in leaving two frantic parents in her\
  \ wake. \n\nThe crowd favourite of the day was the jousting tournament to save the\
  \ kingdom \u2013 which saw the Red Knight and the Black Knight engage in a series\
  \ of duels, culminating in a nail-biting jousting tournament on horseback. \n\n\
  Ultimately the valiant Red knight won and the comely queen was freed from her spell\
  \ and everyone, except the Black Knight, lived happily ever after. \n\nThe kids\
  \ were able to get their photo taken with the knight of their choice. \n\nOur son\
  \ chose the red knight (parental sighs of relief).  Our daughter chose the Black\
  \ Knight. \n\nRaised eyebrows and looks of concern were swapped as we glanced at\
  \ his skull helmet and black leather getup.\n\nDespite our youngest child\u2019\
  s dubious choice in knights, we enjoyed the day out. \n\nIt was a freezing cold\
  \ day with the occasional period of sleet so it actually did feel as though we were\
  \ stuck in a medieval village.\n\nIt was quite friendly on the wallet with a family\
  \ pass for $100 and we managed to avoid the over-priced souvenir stands on the way\
  \ out. \n\nThe only downside was the fact that the castle, opened in 1974, is looking\
  \ a bit tired in some places. \n\nBut through the eyes of a child, this anochronistic,\
  \ incongruous castle set in the middle of pretty much nowhere is pretty darn magical."
