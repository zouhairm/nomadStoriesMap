Text: "At first, we walked by him.\nBeing strangers in this land, we didn\u2019t know\
  \ what standard local behavior looked like. I thought it was perhaps an Irish practice\
  \ of living daringly by being on the edge of Wolfe Tone Bridge so close to falling\
  \ into the raging waters below. I almost paused to capture this strange picture\
  \ of the young man sitting there.\nInstead, I ambled past.\nMy first week in Ireland\
  \ and I\u2019d come to Galway to meet up with more travelers to explore. We were\
  \ crossing over the River Corrib in the dying rays of sunlight when we saw him.\n\
  One in our group noticed something amiss and she turned to me to double-check, \u201C\
  Is he okay? I think he is crying. Should we do something?\"\nI reassured her that\
  \ it was probably nothing and to carry on. She disagreed, and we stood there, continuously\
  \ glancing at the man while we decided our next actions. At this point, I knew we\
  \ could at least check on him. So, we walked over and I don\u2019t think I\u2019\
  ll ever forget what I saw.\nHis tear-filled eyes were extinguished. There was nothing\
  \ there.\nMy mouth took over. I said anything and everything I could think of to\
  \ get him to respond and move his mind from this horrid deed. He continued smoking\
  \ his cigarette, paying no heed.\nI asked his name, where he was from, and assured\
  \ him we weren\u2019t going anywhere until he came down. No response.\nSomeone suggested\
  \ giving him a tissue and each of us eagerly searched in our bags because we were\
  \ afraid, but also determined. We weren\u2019t going to let this man meet his demise\
  \ today. I positioned myself to grab him if he fell and I knew my newfound friends\
  \ would do the same if it came to that. Still, we were nervous to touch him for\
  \ fear of how he would react.\nI realized his plan as he neared the orange end of\
  \ that cancer stick lazily held between two fingers.\nThis smoke was the final act\
  \ before death.\nI made my speech more earnestly, trying harder to break through\
  \ to him. My incessant blabber would only get us so far. When he dropped his cigarette,\
  \ finished, I braced myself to lunge forward.\nBlessedly, an Irish granny came straight\
  \ up, took this man\u2019s arms, and pulled him down. She lectured him about how\
  \ it wasn\u2019t worth it as her companion called the Guard who arrived a short\
  \ moment later. They put him in the back of a police vehicle and drove off.\nAs\
  \ we walked away, my extremely calm demeanor began to dissipate.\nWhile the shock\
  \ of this unexpected encounter settled in on me, my international friends found\
  \ their voices.\n\u201CWe helped save a life.\u201D"
