Text: "Warning! Absent mind and a green jumping frog can bring you to Sahara!\nOriental\
  \ songs at full blast were deafening me and my friends on the way to Sahara in the\
  \ van we were sharing with a friendly group of 12 moroccans. The radiant driver\
  \ of this rolling disco was dancing the most of the time, waiving happily his arms\
  \ and leaving the steering wheel to make its own moves, as our travel companions\
  \ were singing. The atmosphere couldn`t be more Moroccan and we enjoyed the trip\
  \ and picturesque views despite the risk to get deaf or to jump off the mountain\
  \ road.\nThe adventure was just beginning and the surprises started to emerge from\
  \ every corner, as we say in Bulgaria. It is hard to imagine, that the way to the\
  \ scorching desert will pass along a ski resort, and that a giant black field is\
  \ not burned down by the wildest wildfire. And it is really difficult to stay indifferent\
  \ when you see the stunning colorfully striped mountains.\nHowever, the most bizzare\
  \ experience was yet to come among the dunes of Sahara.\nIt`s not recommended to\
  \ ride an angry camel. That`s why we learn our first lesson of camel`s psychology\
  \ just next to the majestic dunes \u2013 never climb on a camel in front a another\
  \ camel which doesn`t have a rider. They eventually get mad and forget about the\
  \ good behaviour.\nHave you ever seen a black camel in a movie? Me neither. That`s\
  \ why I am surprised when I have to climb on the back of a giant black animal.\n\
  The greatest surprise came one hour into our journey when I saw a large green bush,\
  \ as high as the camels, spotted with tens of pink blossoms. Water is no where to\
  \ be seen in a radius of a couple of kms. We were completely baffled by the nature`s\
  \ wonders. It turned out, that there is water 3 m. bellow the surface. That`s why\
  \ there was the camp where we will sleep tonight.\nDuring the cold night, laying\
  \ in my billion-star hotel just under the blackest sky, the nature drawed above\
  \ my head the Milky way in a way I have seen only in photoshopped pictures. Then\
  \ the first sunrays colored the sands in different shades of gray, white, yellow\
  \ and orange.\nI left magical Sahara with eyes full of beauty.\nSo what the hell\
  \ has the story to do with the frog? My boyfriend wanted some explanations how to\
  \ play a game with a jumping frog on my mobile while I was buying tickets to Germany.\
  \ Because if that, I`ve forgotten to use expiring airline gift voucher so I urgently\
  \ needed to use it for another trip. He`ve chosen Barcelona. I `ve added flights\
  \ from there to Morocco."
