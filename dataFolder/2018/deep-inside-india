Text: "Local trains in India are beyond a means of transport, you can see families\
  \ mingling, hawkers selling spicy puffed rice \u2013 jhal muri - in Bengali. I was\
  \ traveling to Bero a village in WestBengal. \n\nI was still in school. In one of\
  \ many festivals we had, I met Umapodo, a helper who visited our town to play drums\
  \ for money (Durga puja drums, story for another time). I was intrigued by the very\
  \ description of his village. A place where houses are carved out of hills, run\
  \ by solar power, but electricity hasn\u2019t reached every home. I had to see the\
  \ place! \n\nIt was an hour\u2019s train ride to Bero from Asansol, where I grew\
  \ up. When you travel across Bengal you cannot miss the lustrous green fields, covered\
  \ with crops. Even in the hottest days this sight can sooth the eyes. \n\nBero looked\
  \ like any other small railway station, empty to an extend it looked barren with\
  \ few waiting for their train. We walked out to find Umapodo waiting. His ear to\
  \ ear smile exposed his toothless gum, with one or two teeth still grabbing on to\
  \ the roots. Next to him was our ride to his home, a bullock cart!\n\nWhat we could\
  \ call a road was a narrow pathway covered with red dust. We took a bumpy ride inside\
  \ his village. If you are visiting someone in the village you become everyone\u2019\
  s guest there. We reached our host\u2019s modest hut with two rooms and a well spread\
  \ veranda; in no time five children ran to greet us. One year apart from each other\
  \ Umapodo had 5 children. They wore oversized clothes, mostly passed on from one\
  \ sibling to the other. Not the well-mannered sophisticated crowd you meet in cities,\
  \ but these kids were cheerful and overjoyed to see new faces. \n\nI took a stroll\
  \ in search of houses built by villagers out of hills. Lack of craftsmanship made\
  \ these houses look beautiful at the most natural form. The local temple was an\
  \ art work, with a protective priest who vehemently argued that the God he worships\
  \ is most powerful. \n\nThe Pandits of the village (considered highest in ageold\
  \ caste system) invited us for lunch. Pandit's wife explained duck meat is the only\
  \ meat of celebration there, they don't cook chicken or lamb. After a heavy lunch\
  \ and innumerable greetings from families around, we headed back to the station.\
  \ \n\nIt was almost evening. The stars were bright and the sky looked vast in the\
  \ absense of street lights and high-rises. It was romantic; and we were warned to\
  \ not visit during dark moon nights. I would see such romantic sky again in about\
  \ a few years on my trip to Ladakh."
