Text: "\u201CAdelante, entra. No te preocupes. Nada te har\xE1 da\xF1o.\u201D (Go\
  \ ahead, enter. Don\u2019t worry. Nothing will hurt you.)\n\nTurbid waters whirled\
  \ before my eyes. Currents hugged briefly before being wrenched in separate directions.\
  \ Our weathered river boat was anchored near the confluence of the Mara\xF1\xF3\
  n and Ucayali Rivers. Nothing but thick jungle behind us and a sliver of the nearest\
  \ town accessible by car on the horizon allowed us to locate ourselves at the edge\
  \ of the Pacaya-Samiria National Reserve.\n\nWe had just met not three days ago,\
  \ and already Tony was urging me to disrobe and slip into the waters of the Amazon.\n\
  \nThe motive in doing so was flashing before my eyes.\n\nPink river dolphins surfaced\
  \ around the boat, each less than a pebble\u2019s toss away. I yearned for a closer\
  \ interaction with these creatures that take the spotlight in so many Peruvian legends.\
  \ However, fear of the unseen and wanting to maintain personal decency in such a\
  \ secluded setting held me back.\n\nOnly the gurgle of the water filled the silence\
  \ as Tony scrutinized me. But instead of a follow-up of persistence, he chose patience.\n\
  \nIt was a patience learned only by an Amazonian native who\u2019s spent decades\
  \ unearthing the jungle\u2019s secrets. It was a patience I admired during of our\
  \ brief time together.\n\nI caught another glance of a dolphin skirting out of sight.\n\
  \nBefore it was too late, I quickly stripped down and positioned myself on the outer\
  \ edge of the boat. Pushing off, I allowed the cool river to engulf my body.\n\n\
  Almost immediately, mud squelched around my toes and swallowed my feet\u2026 ankles\u2026\
  \ lower shins... Like quicksand, it was threatening to take me whole, and my reaction\
  \ to flail just made it worse.\n\n\u201CNo pasa nada! Tranquila!\u201D (Nothing\
  \ will happen! Stay calm!)\n\nI frantically gazed up at Tony signaling for me to\
  \ relax, which prompted a trickle of serenity over me like wax down a newly lit\
  \ candle. The sinking subsided almost simultaneously with my thrashing.\n\nI switched\
  \ my attention back to the river. To my dismay, the dolphins had already dispersed.\n\
  \nTony\u2019s look of consolation said it all.\n\nInitial fear of the unknown made\
  \ me hesitate. He knew that.\n\nAlthough our connection was short-lived, his composure\
  \ lives on in spirit as a continual reminder to let go of uncertainties that often\
  \ shroud the beauties of life."
