Text: "We decided to cast-off the difficult personalities as per our New Year\u2019\
  s resolution and vowed to never travel with boozers who want to stop and tinkle\
  \ every hour of the journey. We were Botswana bound, just the two of us, with an\
  \ American friend who had just resigned from her prestigious job in the inner city\
  \ of Joburg. She didn\u2019t want to cross the channel immediately and meet her\
  \ Brooklynites in her state. In short, she had a difficult time with her boss. Don\u2019\
  t ask. But it has something to do with a toxic male who smeared performance-enhancing-patriarchal\
  \ ointment on his body coming to work, especially on Mondays. Her non-negotiable\
  \ American way, a cross she bears stoically, clashed with the gung-ho male conditioning\
  \ of the man. Parting ways was dramatic. Skittles were aired. And it will be a while\
  \ yet before the labour law sees this matter. \nWe decided that \u2018Bots\u2019\
  \ as she calls Botswana, would be the ideal place to repair. Joburg had reminded\
  \ her of why she left New York. A week in the capital city of Gaborone would do.\
  \ But first she wanted to see Mahikeng, a North West province of South Africa, 90\
  \ minutes before Botswana border. She wanted to scour the geological sites, touch\
  \ some rare stones and see how rural folks \u2018hick it\u2019 on the other side\
  \ of the pond. But nothing much was on offer in Mahikeng when we landed on Tuesday\
  \ morning. The museum was closed for renovations. Cultural institutions were either\
  \ closed or \u201Cunder administration\u201D, a political aphorism which simply\
  \ means they were not performing economically. We exchanged the few dollars and\
  \ rands to Pula, the currency of Botswana for taxi fare. The currency is slightly\
  \ higher than the South African currency with just 65 cents. Arriving at night due\
  \ to the slow driving and police presence, we dropped our bags at a bed and breakfast\
  \ and headed to town. She remarked on the cleanliness of the town and wondered why\
  \ the police were not carrying guns or strutting cockily like their counterparts\
  \ in South Africa. A cab driver had to intervene. Police in \u2018Bots\u2019 run\
  \ a social service, he told us. \u201CWhen they arrest you they don\u2019t make\
  \ a fuss. If you are not ready to be taken to the cop shop, you just tell them you\
  \ have some errands to run and they give you time\u201D. She was like \u201Cwow...isn\u2019\
  t that amayzing!\u201DAnd for this she wants her mom to relocate to \u2018Bots\u2019\
  \ because it is a cheap and safe place to retire.  And the male franchise is sweet."
