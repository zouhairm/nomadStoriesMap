Text: "If you want to feel safe driving in Bangkok, first practice in India. And,\
  \ if you're going to practice in India, make sure you go to Kolkata and ask for\
  \ Pollay Singh, cabdriver. \nI met Pollay in an overheated conference room at the\
  \ Royal Botanical Gardens, where I'd been commissioned to photograph the world's\
  \ oldest flower show. He was a huge man, shoeless, with a large stream of betel\
  \ juice trickling down his chin. Upon entering the room, he uttered a maniacal laugh\
  \ while staring us each in the eye.\nLunch was the first order of business and Pollay\
  \ and another cabbie argued over who was going to ferry us to the restaurant. They\
  \ decided to split us up. I opted for Pollay's cab because, hey, who wouldn't wanna\
  \ ride with a shoeless guy high on betel nut? Fastening my seat belt elicited a\
  \ stern rebuke from Pollay, \"you don't trust me?\" so I unclipped. \nTraffic in\
  \ Kolkata needs its own passport: as soon as you're in it, you're Somewhere Else.\
  \ I've been in some hair raising car rides around the world but nothing, absolutely\
  \ nothing, prepared me for what was about to unfurl. The other taxi had crept a\
  \ few car lengths ahead, something Pollay took as a personal affront (although I'm\
  \ not sure how he even noticed, since he spent most of his time turning around to\
  \ talk to those in the back seat). With no warning, he pulled out into oncoming\
  \ traffic and laid on the horn. This went on for a few blocks and I surreptitiously\
  \ put my seatbelt back on while Pollay was cursing at a tuktuk driver who'd had\
  \ the nerve to slow down for a pedestrian. Oncoming traffic was, however, not agreeable\
  \ enough for Pollay so we swerved back into our lane and kept going, across the\
  \ entire road, until we'd jumped the curb and entered a park, barely slowing down\
  \ as we barreled through the trees. The entire time, Pollay kept up his habit of\
  \ talking face to face with those in the back seat. Finally, the park ended and\
  \ we were approaching a major intersection. Nobody wanted to let us in so Pollay,\
  \ still on the grass, drove right up to the front car and then cut back onto the\
  \ road. With a screech of metal, our bumpers locked and I thought we'd have to hoof\
  \ it from there (which I was more than ready to do) but no, Pollay had a plan. He\
  \ put the cab into first gear and punched it, ripping off the other guy's bumper\
  \ completely, then slammed it into reverse and pushed the other car off the road.\
  \ The light turned green and Pollay hit the gas again, laughing the whole time.\
  \ Take that, Bangkok."
