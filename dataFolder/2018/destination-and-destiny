Text: "I visited Luxembourg to work with a small group of 'Spiritually Interested'\
  \ women. I arrived in The Grand Duchy, feeling oddly apprehensive. Luxembourg is\
  \ home to the European Investment Bank and is considered a Tax Haven. My thought,\
  \ 'Don't judge a book by it's cover'. Stepping outside the Airport I was greeted\
  \ by a huge free-standing orange sign, saying \"Moien\" Luxembourg was saying \"\
  Hello!\" Waiting nearby was my host for the week. Our journey 'home' took us through\
  \ some of the most stunning Forest I've ever seen, towering, Cathedral-like  Pines\
  \ glowing with health, clear roads, quaint villages, rich farmland and finally to\
  \ our destination in the Moselle wine region.  \nI was offered a little sight-seeing\
  \ before our workshop the next day. I was excited to get to know this tiny country.\
  \ Luxembourg City was beautifully clean, well preserved and had a strange air of\
  \ calm. The oldest section, The Vianden, is Medieval, the buildings cling to the\
  \ side of a fortified gorge spanned by an enormous viaduct, which for a stunning\
  \ view, can be crossed on foot. Next, the American WWII Cemeteries, resting place\
  \ for victims of the Battle of the Bulge. Here I identified the source of my apprehension.\
  \ I should explain a little. I work shamanically, travel anywhere, am highly sensitive,\
  \ which, connects me with subtleties that others may miss. This place was eerily\
  \ spotless, as though a beautiful silk cloth had been laid over poorly disguised\
  \ carnage; I left, unable to digest the loss of life in the name of patriotism and\
  \ valor. It doesn't take a Sensitive to recognize that there were no victors here.\
  \ Then, to the German Cemetery tucked away in nearby woods. The vibe was so different,\
  \ relaxed and honest, dropped leaves and a sprinkling of wild flowers. Here the\
  \ reality was, yes, the then Germans started the War and famously lost, so no victors\
  \ here either.  Did either of these places give opportunity for the deceased to\
  \ be truly honored? Where were the individual ceremonies, memories and offerings?\
  \ The personal stories of family sacrifice. In Shamanic societies the well-being\
  \ of the Ancestors is paramount to the well-being of the living and the Planet!\
  \ There are thousands of sites like these and my visits connected me to the personal\
  \ stories of the fallen that live in the Earth Herself. This experience changed\
  \ the direction of my work, I'm inspired to help, now traveling, honoring similar\
  \ sites, releasing those who cannot rest and this truly was the last thing I expected!"
