Text: "The boots came off. And almost all of my sopping clothes had it not been for\
  \ my high-strung tour guide. We were about to reach the cable car docking point\
  \ where a Chinese mob in their Sunday best would want a selfie with me: the white\
  \ girl covered in blood and carrying a gong, a premature souvenir purchase. While\
  \ I completely failed at learning one word of Vietnamese, I understood my guide\
  \ perfectly, \u201CI CARRY BOOTS! KEEP CLOTHES ON! I carry gong.\u201D No\u2026\n\
  Having abandoned most self-respect 3,000 meters ago, I decided to bite the embarrassment\
  \ bullet and buy us both an expensive return lift ticket - expensive for me, the\
  \ struggling musician, but what also equates to half a year\u2019s pay for the Sa\
  \ Pa Valley citizen. I was going to surprise him... If we made it... He said very\
  \ few hikers complete Fansipan, the tallest point in Indochina, which was thrillingly\
  \ marketed for having taken the lives of three tourists. And while I assumed that\
  \ was the reason I was the only one to sign up for the tour, in our hike I discovered\
  \ the existence of a lift, that I was taking the \u201Clong way,\u201D long enough\
  \ to find the meaning of life and to hypothesize the meaning of \u201CIndochina.\u201D\
  \nI followed my guide\u2019s voice through the monsoon clouds, what I often mistook\
  \ as horror-movie fog that would infrequently part to reveal violent cliffs cascading\
  \ into all of the green in Heaven. As we hiked, minutes felt like hours, each leg\
  \ lift forming at least 90 degrees, but when the valley revealed its magic, I dared\
  \ not breathe or blink, stretching the seconds, more memorable than any first kiss,\
  \ overwhelmingly aware of every speck of grit and friendly spider on my body. All\
  \ the questions of the universe rotating and bending in my head were numbed.\nUpon\
  \ the final step, I realized that day, the best day of my life, would have nothing\
  \ to do with following through on any decision, nothing from self-worth to feminism,\
  \ thrill or meditation, not about two souls once divided by war, but about nothing\
  \ at all. We were just two of twenty thousand ants Instagramming that hill. And\
  \ while that might sound like nihilistic existentialism, the experience was as positively\
  \ lush as Fansipan. The crisp air stung my panting lungs with its insight: because\
  \ I didn\u2019t have to fight for any deeper meaning, I could do whatever I wanted.\
  \ Many times Death in loose pebbles and soft mud almost took my life, but I could\
  \ hike that shit again. Over some cliff I had lost my mallet, so I headbutted my\
  \ gong, tears polishing its surface."
