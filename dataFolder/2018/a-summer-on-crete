Text: "The last thing I expected when I first stepped foot on the dusty Cretan soil\
  \ at the crowded airport in Chania, was the exuberant feeling that one usually gets\
  \ in those rare moments of true inspiration, that brings us closer to our inner\
  \ selves. The feeling only lasts for a short time, but can leave a lasting impression\
  \ on a person\u2019s soul. \nTouched by the island\u2019s colorful background, a\
  \ mixture of green vegetation and a beautiful marine coast, which somehow blurred\
  \ the line between the sea water and the fleeting sky, I started walking down the\
  \ stairs, rushing to complete all of the administrative procedures that are a necessary\
  \ evil when one decides to travel around the globe. \nAs I navigated my way throughout\
  \ the crowd of tourists, I started contemplating just how special the island of\
  \ Crete really was. Knowing several weeks in advance that I would be spending this\
  \ year\u2019s summer vacation in the heart of the Mediterranean, I brushed up on\
  \ my knowledge of Greece\u2019 largest island during my flight from Thessaloniki.\
  \ \nThe island was once home to the Minoans, Europe\u2019s earliest civilization,\
  \ whose citizens were literate 130.000 years ago. Right from the bat, this sole\
  \ fact gave me a feeling of experiencing something profoundly deep, a sense of ancient\
  \ history that most nations can only dream of claiming rights to. The thought of\
  \ walking through the streets where Europe\u2019s very first cradle of life began\
  \ such a long time ago, instilled some kind of entitlement in me, no matter how\
  \ unjust it was. \nAs soon as I started entering the island\u2019s mainland, I noticed\
  \ the modern architecture and the urban tourist attractions, which made Crete one\
  \ of the most visited destinations in the world. And yet, all of that technological\
  \ marvel had not overshadowed the beauties of the landscape around it. Instead,\
  \ it somehow enhanced the experience, in the process making the island one of those\
  \ rare places on Earth where nature and society managed to co-exist without stepping\
  \ on each other\u2019s toes. Instead, they flourished in an integrated synergy.\n\
  As I realized that what I was witnessing at the time was a sight to behold, a single\
  \ thought had crossed my mind. This beauty in front of me, and all the feelings\
  \ it instilled in me, would not go to waste. I quickly took out my cell phone and\
  \ with excitement in my eyes, started typing: A Summer on Crete, the text which,\
  \ a few years later, would form the basis for my debut novel as a writer. \nIt truly\
  \ was the last thing I expected, indeed..."
