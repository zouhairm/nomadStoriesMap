Text: "After years of missing my sister Laura, I felt a deep need of meeting her,\
  \ although that meant the challenge of crossing the ocean on my own. We deserved\
  \ the happiness of join the family, so I decided not only travelling, but also arriving\
  \ as a surprise. Fortunately, my brother in law Jes\xFAs helped me from the beginning\
  \ of the idea: They planned spending a weekend in Sevilla, and we would meet there.\
  \ \n That May Sunday morning found me at Atocha, getting on a high speed 'Ave' train.\
  \ In few seconds, it reached enough speed for going from Madrid to Sevilla in three\
  \ hours. On time, I arrived in Santa Justa Station at 1.30, but I must hurry if\
  \ I wanted to get at Macarena\u2019s Basilica at 2 o\u2019clock, where we would\
  \ meet.  Some minutes later, I got off the taxi and I faced that lively yellow arch,\
  \ before the church entrance. \n I was looking at the balconies around, sprinkled\
  \ with red geraniums, when they appeared. The emotion filled us entirely, and we\
  \ merged into a long hug that fixed distance, time, and absence. When we recovered\
  \ of such a strong emotion, we went sightseeing. After a funny lunch under a palm\
  \ shadow, we visited the Basilica when it opened. The silver shine remarked the\
  \ holy figure, dressed with Andaluc\xEDa colours. The long dark green cloak was\
  \ a sublime way of representing hope, adding delicate gold embroidery and emeralds\
  \ too. We were actually visiting one of the most important places of Sevilla, and\
  \ it was the beginning of a Flemish city waiting to be discovered.\n   We continued\
  \ to Plaza Espa\xF1a, an iconic monument to Spain history, with a clear Venetian\
  \ style. Mosaics, columns and the interesting colour of bricks played the main role\
  \ there.  This space was surrounded by images for each of the provinces, laid in\
  \ semicircle. In the middle, Spanish flag raised crowning the building.\n   Some\
  \ blocks later, we walked by Guadalquivir riverside, near the famous neighborhood\
  \ Triana, and we had typical Spanish \u2018tapas\u2019.  Finally, the narrow stoned\
  \ streets lead us to La Giralda, the legendary bell tower, while its chimes became\
  \ music at sunset.  \nAfter that intense day, we left the city the following morning.\
  \ Our travelling would go on to Almer\xEDa, where they had established home. From\
  \ the car, going through sunflowers fields, I smiled because Mediterranean Sea was\
  \ waiting, with garlic and tomato scent, and the eternal game between blue and green\
  \ colours, its peace and foam of waves."
