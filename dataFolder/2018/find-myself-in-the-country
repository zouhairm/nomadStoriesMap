Text: "At the age of 8 I didn\u2019t know what to expect , a big plane , my family\
  \ by my side and our life packed into boxes and shipped to the other side of the\
  \ world. For a child across the world felt like across the universe but I thought\
  \ the world was the same wherever you went but New Zealand wasn\u2019t what I was\
  \ expecting. Hot Christmas\u2019s , hills that go on for miles, a beach right at\
  \ the front door it was like I had gone on holiday to some spectacular universe\
  \ but alas I had not, I had come home. I expected people to be the same, I expected\
  \ the foods to be the same but everywhere I turned there was something new and exciting\
  \ waiting for me to explore. The people, walking down the street greet you as you\
  \ pass by, im Yorkshire  you would encounter one cheerful person out of 20 but in\
  \ this land of opportunity there was 19 our of 20 at least. The Maori traditional\
  \ food, The Hangi I was so curious to try because boys not everyday yountry foods\
  \ cooked underground and that\u2019s a feast I will never forget. Going to school\
  \ and learning a culture that was so rich and beautiful made me feeel apart of it\
  \ all, small white girl from Yorkshire joining Kapa Shaka within her first week\
  \ was what astounded people, someone so young trying to enrich themselves in other\
  \ people\u2019s culture amazes them , but it will always be what I want to do. Being\
  \ able to connect to a culture and learn what they have to teach will thrill me\
  \ and help me learn about the world and tahts what I hope to right about by travelling\
  \ around the world. I want to live , eat and breathe all the cultures that I can\
  \ because to fully enjoy a country or place you need to understand it\u2019s people\
  \ and their land. Maori was the first culture I ever learnt from and I feel more\
  \ in sync with New Zealand because of that. Feeling Enriched by its cultures and\
  \ learning how New Zealand became makes you wonder what else is out there, what\
  \ other cultures am I missing out on , what else is there for me to discover for\
  \ myself."
