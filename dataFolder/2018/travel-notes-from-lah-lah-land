  \ tickets to anywhere (even Timbuktu) without any luck.. $10. \n4 days of Chinese\
  \ New Year holidays with nowhere to go\u2026 frustrating. \nKnow that you can still\
  \ get a visa for Malaysia in 1 day and go around Malaysia\u2019s best destinations\
  \ by road for 4 full days for less than $500 - Priceless.\u201C\nMalaysia - It was\
  \ not my first choice, in fact it was last! But, 4 days of Chinese New Year. Every\
  \ flight going out of Singapore was booked! I was desperate after 4 months in Singapore.\
  \ As Singapore being a one-city country, how many times you go to the same place\
  \ again and again?\nMy colleague introduced me to one of his friend, Hiren. Told\
  \ him about wanted to go to Thailand (first choice), he said he wanted to go there\
  \ too! Wow, 2 are better! Big savings! So I said let\u2019s try for tickets, if\
  \ luck\u2019s with us then we might get the high priced last minute tickets (FYI\
  \ \u2013 My luck sucks!)  So, we didn\u2019t got the tickets. It was the last week\
  \ before the holidays. I told him let\u2019s try Malaysia! Went to Malaysian embassy,\
  \ applied for visa and got the visa on 4th day (duh\u2026 weekend) so, Monday got\
  \ the visa, called the travel agent, booked bus tickets for Kuala Lumpur, $55 per\
  \ person 1 way. Was feeling like I am in heaven! Finally I am going out of Singapore\
  \ for 4 full days! Well the big day arrived (Night actually) we were catching an\
  \ AC bus from Lavender train station, Singapore to Johar Bahru(JB), Malaysia which\
  \ was only 45 mins away from there and from JB we\u2019re changing the bus. We boarded\
  \ the bus at 10:30 from Lavender, reached Singapore border in 25 mins, the traffic\
  \ was bad. took us more than 45 mins to clear customs and immigrations from both\
  \ sides! It\u2019s one bridge between Singapore and Malaysia. You cross the bridge\
  \ and you are in Malaysia. We reached JB at around 12:00. Changed the bus. the Seats\
  \ was really huge, almost as big as plane\u2019s business class! The travel company\
  \ gave us couple of Oranges as a good luck (I was puzzled when they gave us oranges\
  \ for good luck? is the bus service and roads in Malaysia that bad that we need\
  \ a good luck, instead of a good driver and decently maintained bus?) but, then\
  \ I found out that in Chinese new year it\u2019s considered as a good luck and it\u2019\
  s customary to give oranges to one another! Well, a lesson in Chinese culture. I\
  \ was excited about the whole Malaysian experience.\n\nSo! Malaysia, ready or not,\
  \ here I come\u2026"
