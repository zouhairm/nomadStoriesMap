  \ of time?\u201D A bit sweaty despite the cold and a bit winded due to the altitude,\
  \ we pause, craning our necks upwards to ponder these ancient pictographs. Handprints\
  \ in white. Intermixed are three stick men of differing earthy hues in very athletic\
  \ squats.  \u201CBut how could a child get waaaaaay up there???,\u201D I query.\
  \ \n\nFor 32 years my husband and I have hiked together, wondering and wandering.\
  \ We are at it again on a crisp and bright winter morning at the bygone home of\
  \ the ancient Anasazi people in the (former) Bears Ears National Monument of southeastern\
  \ Utah.  \u201CWell, obviously these people were great climbers...,\u201D he remarks\
  \ looking, down, down, down to the canyon floor with its swaying cottonwoods perched\
  \ on the riverbank, from whence we had recently come. \u201CThese people.\u201D\
  \ Who were they? Seven hundred years ago, in one sweeping and mysterious exodus,\
  \ they were gone, leaving behind a canyon full of cliff dwellings and rock art.\
  \ We are in pursuit of answers on this breezy and brisk day.\n \nClambering down\
  \ into Ballroom Cave Ruin, I peer into a tiny chamber with a smoke-stained wall.\
  \ \u201CWhoa, can you imagine sleeping with all that smoke!!!!\u201D I call out\
  \ to my fellow traveler. Bundled up in his blue down jacket with duct tape on the\
  \ sleeve, and the beanie from Tasmania tugged down over his ears, he answers, \u201C\
  Today? Yup. Smoke equals warmth.\u201D\n\nThe inside of the cave IS like a ballroom!\
  \ It could have housed my senior prom. Standing quietly, in this lonely place, I\
  \ imagined them. Momentarily, I feel l as if I am trespassing and should have knocked.\
  \ The defensive wall at the opening of the cave displays expertly squared-off bricks\
  \ still intact. Equipped with peep holes, I am aware that the inhabitants of Ballroom\
  \ Cave would not have appreciated this surprise visit. \u201CWhat do you think they\
  \ were watching for?\u201D I call out. The answer echoes back from very deep within\
  \ the cave, \u201CAnything coming and anything going.\u201D Squatting down on a\
  \ large, flat rock, I gaze down at the canyon. The sun, still low in the sky, sets\
  \ the red rock aflame. \n\nWhile dusting off  my boots, I spy a series of holes,\
  \ called metates, left by our ancient hosts. I run my fingers over the sandstone\
  \ holes where someone once ground corn, perhaps a thousand years ago. No doubt feeling\
  \ the breeze from South Mule Canyon on their cheeks, as I am now. Perhaps shivering,\
  \ just like me. The temporal void between us is vast, but geographically, we touch."
