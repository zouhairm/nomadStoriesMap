Text: "With his signature, stoic minimalism, my Korean manager asked me to be in a\
  \ tv commercial on my first weekend in the country. \u2018For restaurant,\u2019\
  \ he said. \u2018No problem. Tomorrow we move your class to restaurant for tv commercial,\
  \ okay?\u2019\n\n The idea intrigued me but I was woefully under the winter weather.\
  \ Feverish and jetlagged, with aching bones and a congested head, I was not at all\
  \ certain I could handle a broadcast camera pointed at me.  \n\n The next day I\
  \ found myself deeper in the throes of sickness and sitting on the cold cement floor\
  \ of a spartan, deserted restaurant with a few cameras trained on me and a couple\
  \ of teenagers from my class who spoke broken beginner English. My legs were stiff\
  \ and awkwardly pretzeled to fit under the low table. Too queasy to speak I didn\u2019\
  t ask many questions, hoping that if I kept quiet we could get this over with quicker.\
  \ \n\nThe director told me that they would begin filming when the food came out\
  \ and we started eating. \u201CHappy eating delicious seafood and talking with students.\u2019\
  \ he said benignly. I told him I didn\u2019t like seafood. \u2018Really?\u2019 he\
  \ frowned.\n\nAt that moment an older Korean woman\u2014an ajuma\u2014darted out\
  \ of the kitchen carrying a metal bowl with something slimy winding its many-legged\
  \ way furiously up the sides and out of it. She placed it before me and I leapt\
  \ away from the table a good five feet. My students, having just received their\
  \ bowls as well, raised in delight their chopsticks entwined with live squids to\
  \ their mouths. San-nakchi. Raw long-arm baby octopus, actually. I watched agog\
  \ as the teens wrestled the squirming creatures into their mouths. One of the boys\
  \ giggled and a long, wet gray tentacle flew back out his mouth and fastened one\
  \ of its suction cups on his face in a frantic, last-ditch effort of escape. \n\n\
  Nausea bubbled up in me. Was this an actual thing, I wondered? Eating live octopus?\
  \ The ajummas snickered as the tv director came over to console me.\nMokpo, the\
  \ small town on the southern tip of the Korean peninsula where we were, had a good\
  \ supply of sannakchi, a Korean delicacy, and this restaurant was famous for it,\
  \ he explained.  \n\nEventually, regaining my composure, I gamely agreed to hold\
  \ up for the camera a pair of chopsticks coiled with the writhing octopus, state\
  \ my name, and plug the restaurant\u2019s sadistic deliciousness.\n\nCome Monday\
  \ I was downtown standing in line at an outdoor coffee kiosk when a gray-haired\
  \ Korean man nudged me and said, \u2018Hello, Meester Neecholas, from tv commercial.\u2019"
