Text: "It's hot and humid on my first morning in Kyoto, a nice reprieve from the torrential\
  \ downpour of the last two days.  I\u2019m on a tight schedule, with a tour booked\
  \ to see Kinkaku-ji.  Even as I booked my travel plans, I knew better than to trust\
  \ my ability to navigate the Japanese bus system on my own.  Google says the meeting\
  \ point is 5 minutes away on the other side of the railroad tracks.  I give myself\
  \ 15 minutes.\n\nI'm confident as I walk down the street, but the smile melts off\
  \ my face as I realize the street I've gone down won't get me to the other side\
  \ of Kyoto Station.  Hesitating, I turn back the way I came, speed-walking past\
  \ my hotel and through the station, racing past tourists and locals alike.  The\
  \ minutes are ticking closer to 8:25, when the tour will depart with or without\
  \ me.\n\nWhen I find the address of the departure point, there are no signs for\
  \ the tour.  No groups of tourists or guides waving flags.  I wander around, scanning\
  \ and searching.  As the minutes pass, I get in an elevator and try going down.\
  \  A young Japanese woman gets in with me.\n\nI\u2019m panicking, which seems to\
  \ be a theme of this trip.  I\u2019ve spent hours researching the best temples to\
  \ see, the train schedules, what to do at an onsen.  But blogs have not prepared\
  \ me to step off a train during rush hour at Tokyo Station, trying to fight through\
  \ a horde of well-dressed businessmen.  For seeking shelter on Okunoshima as a typhoon\
  \ rages above, getting soaked to the bone as I wait for the next ferry.  For being\
  \ lost and confused, for an alphabet that looks nothing like mine and kanji I don\u2019\
  t understand, for learning to let go of my plans.  I take a deep breath.\n\n\u201C\
  Sumimasen,\u201D I say.  Excuse me.  This is as far as I can get with my broken\
  \ tourist Japanese, so I hold out the paper I am clutching, the one that has the\
  \ address of the departure point typed neatly in size 12 font.  I may be lost, but\
  \ at least I am prepared.  She examines it.\n\nHer eyes meet mine as the elevator\
  \ doors open for her floor.  I expect her to shake her head, to walk out the doors\
  \ and leave me here. \n Instead, she takes my hand, clutching it tightly.  Hers\
  \ is small and calloused.  She pulls me out of the elevator and leads me down a\
  \ hallway, then a staircase.  We round a corner and I see the tour company\u2019\
  s name in yellow letters. \n\n\u201CArigato gozaimasu,\" I say, trying to thank\
  \ her.  I am no longer lost.  But she has already turned and disappeared back into\
  \ the crowd."
