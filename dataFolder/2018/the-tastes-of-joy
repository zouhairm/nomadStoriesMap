Text: "Last year I found myself traveling across the Dominican Republic, from the\
  \ snow white sandy beach of Punta Cana to the mystical caves of the Haitises National\
  \ Park and finally the mountains of Jarabacoa, whose narrow streets hummed with\
  \ moped traffic. Eager to experience the country and culture I fast-tracked my learning\
  \ of travel Spanish and studied guides on the flora and fauna, food and etiquette.\
  \ Every website and book warned of pickpockets and noir-movie taxi drivers, and\
  \ most discouragingly, eating foods not prepared in restaurants or purchased in\
  \ stores. But I've been to New York City, man. I know a thing or two about protecting\
  \ my valuables and navigating rides. And any misgivings I could've had about eating\
  \ foods made by locals had long since faded since I'd worked at a non-profit focused\
  \ on integrating Burmese and Haitian refugees into our community. I'd sat cross-legged\
  \ on floors many times, sharing meals I could neither pronounce nor recognize, with\
  \ people I knew nothing about except that they'd lovingly prepared something and\
  \ graciously offered it to me. There was no chance I was going to miss  out on any\
  \ opportunity to share food with the people I met in this beautiful country.\nIn\
  \ Punta Cana I gratefully swigged a shot of homemade Mamajuana, a popular concoction\
  \ of herbs and rum and wine and who knows what. It's supposed to be an aphrodisiac\
  \ but it just made me wax poetic for a full ten minutes about a tree full of hummingbirds\
  \ I was standing under. Good stuff.\nIn the Haitises we were, by yet another kiss\
  \ of the fates, the only guests at a mountainside resort. It was a well-kept secret\
  \ frequented on weekends by locals but our stop was during the week and aside from\
  \ a handful of staff, three lazy dogs and a cat I dubbed Pancake, we had the place\
  \ to ourselves. With my Spanish improving daily I was able to communicate to the\
  \ manager and cook that I'd heard about a dish I wanted to try. Within ten minutes\
  \ my friend and I were in the kitchen learning how to filet and grill fish, press\
  \ and fry tostones and prepare guandules con coco. We listened to Bachata music\
  \ while we cooked and then all of us shared the food we'd made. \nWhen our driver\
  \ came to take us to Jarabacoa at dawn the next morning I cobbled together a request\
  \ for coffee and he smiled, made a U-turn and drove us down to a street vendor just\
  \ preparing the most fragrant, sweet coffee I've ever had. As the sun rose I sipped\
  \ the warm drink and smiled, wondering what we'd find for lunch."
