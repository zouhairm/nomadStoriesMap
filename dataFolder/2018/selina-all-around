Text: "Okay, here we go. I made the decision to leave Germany. Beautiful beaches,\
  \ sunny days, friends and a whole new world for a European girl like myself ten\
  \ waiting ahead. LA has always been my dream of living. Don\u2019t ask me why, but\
  \ since I was little I only talked about moving there. And when I made it I felt\
  \ home. For the first time of my life. And no, it\u2019s not because of the celebrity\
  \ and all that famous stuff. No, it\u2019s that feeling of knowing that all of a\
  \ sudden everything is possible. With 22 years I made my dream come true but wait.\
  \ You can\u2019t already archive your dreams with 22. Like what will be your motivation\
  \ when you\u2019ve already arrived where you want to be? After 6 months I decided\
  \ to move on. \u201CYou\u2019re not ready to arrive yet, Selina\u201D that\u2019\
  s all I told myself. So I moved to a country where all I knew so far was how to\
  \ say Hello, Bye and Thanks. But all I wanted is give it a try. Get out of your\
  \ comfort zone. We all heard about French people not willing to speak another language.\
  \ Anyways, it turned out the saying is almost true, most french people really don\u2019\
  t want to speak another language like English BUT they are lovely people, still\
  \ trying hard to give you the chance to learn at least their language. And that\u2019\
  s what I did. I learned french in one year, met beautiful people. Had amazing neighborhood\
  \ meetings right in the middle of our street where everyone brought food and got\
  \ together. I have seen the most clear and blue water at the calanque. My pictures\
  \ looked like the water of a swimming pool but this was all in pure nature and only\
  \ reachable by a 1,5h hike or renting a kayak or boat. Like paradise in the south\
  \ of Europe. I made new friends and I grew so much inside. Everyday there was this\
  \ wow moment when you realize how much you have grown. It has not always been roses\
  \ and sunshine but looking back it only looks like this. I am not Selina when I\
  \ would have decided to stay. From France I moved to Ireland - the country I have\
  \ never imagined even traveling to. I love the sun and beaches. I imagined Ireland\
  \ always as the green landscape with houses apart from each other with at least\
  \ a kilometer. But this is where I am living since 6 months now. I could go on and\
  \ on. I am not always happy with my decisions in first place but I am always happy\
  \ at the end of my journey because that\u2019s what we do, right? We make the best\
  \ out of it and we grow. We surprise ourselves and we get addicted with that feeling.\
  \ So here I am. Ready to take the next step."
