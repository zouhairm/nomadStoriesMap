Text: "I barely had an evening at Kalpa and wasn\u2019t hoping to accomplish much.\
  \ In general the trip was half baked and as it turned out, I was going to come back\
  \ from Nako after a couple of days, just touching the border of Spiti, due to unavoidable\
  \ circumstances. Nevertheless, I finally broke my personal barrier or going beyond\
  \ Sangla and at least marginally witnessing what a cold desert is, by reaching Nako\
  \ which is technically a part of Kinnaur but in spirit a part of Spiti.\n\nAnyways\
  \ coming back to Kalpa, I think I first say a few things about Reckong Peo. What\
  \ is interesting is that I always thought Reckong Peo to be a small provisional\
  \ settlement only existing as a transit point. Why did I think so? Simply because\
  \ I learnt that the district headquarters were shifted here from Kalpa, which was\
  \ the original settlement.\n\nAnyways my misconceptions were cleared as soon as\
  \ the bus entered Peo. For a region as sparsely populated as this, it was pretty\
  \ large and crowded. Surely I did not expect to witness a traffic jam after travelling\
  \ this far from Delhi. It took me some time to figure out how to reach Kalpa and\
  \ finally boarded a local bus. It left the Peo town and after around 15 mins reached\
  \ the main bus stand which seemed to be somewhere in between Peo and Kalpa. Anyways,\
  \ it did not spend much time and moved on. I finally reached Kalpa at around 4:30\
  \ in the afternoon and was surprised to see such a small and sleepy village.\n\n\
  The peaks of Kinnaur Kailash had become visible even as I approached Peo. Now from\
  \ Kalpa they were visible in their full glory. Kinnaur Kailash (6050 meters) is\
  \ normally dark while the Jorkanden peak is even taller and remains snowclad all\
  \ the time. I saw a small hotel at the right position, i.e. the windows looking\
  \ directly at the peaks in question. At the top of Kinnaur Kailash, there is a several\
  \ feet high rock of phallic shape that is popularly known as the Shipping for obvious\
  \ reasons. It apparently changes color several times a day, based on sunlight. I\
  \ caught the near scarlet hue during the golden hour.\n\nKalpa more often than not\
  \ serves as a overnight halt for people going to Spiti and it in itself does not\
  \ draw too many tourists. There are no particularly well defined attractions here\
  \ although the hotel manager told me of a pasture called \u201CChaka\u201D a few\
  \ hours trek away. Apparently it also has a lake. \n\nI am now really keen on the\
  \ Kinnaur Kailash Parikrama trek that will let me reach the interiors of these mountains."
