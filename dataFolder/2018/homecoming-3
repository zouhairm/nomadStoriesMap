Text: "When I see them for the first time, chatting and laughing, slightly blurred\
  \ through the glass that separates the baggage claim from the exit, I feel a sudden\
  \ rush of adrenaline. Maybe it is only the glaring neon lights or the crackling\
  \ atmosphere of an international airport arrival. But as my future parents-in-law,\
  \ strangely familiar through all the pictures, hug me for the first time, the tension\
  \ releases. On the way home, I lean my face against the cold window, watching the\
  \ endless blocks of houses pass by for what seems like hours, listening with only\
  \ half an ear to the conversations in a foreign language. As the car finally crosses\
  \ the Yangtze river bridge, I begin to understand, why Wuhan is referred to as the\
  \ 'Chicago of China'. Skyscrapers line the riverbanks, each one of them illuminated\
  \ in different colours, creating a splashy burst of light on the black surface of\
  \ the water. The view is clear and the air crisp. 'It has been raining for the past\
  \ two days', I get told. \n\nThe building is situated next to the lake. I can recognize\
  \ the vague silhouettes of fishermen sitting at the lakeside, waiting for their\
  \ last catch. Several old scooters are parked in front of the house, each equipped\
  \ with a blanket attached to the handlebar to protect its drivers from the biting\
  \ cold. As we enter the flat, welcoming warmth surrounds me. I can feel my feet\
  \ touching a thick, soft carpet. Insecure, I quickly take off my shoes. \n\nLater\
  \ that night, my future mother-in-law calls me to the kitchen. \"Call her m\u0101\
  ma\", my fianc\xE9 whispers. Her name is Liu Xiannian. She is effortlessly graceful\
  \ and elegant yet surrounded by an air of youthful insouciance. Her almond shaped\
  \ eyes smile at me as she carefully unwraps a tea brick. I am surprised, how little\
  \ words it takes to let someone in on the secrets of making Chinese tea. Washing\
  \ the precious leaves for the fourth time, I smile at myself. This is the end of\
  \ my weakness for artificially flavoured teas from the supermarket. \n\nAs we all\
  \ sit down for dinner, my eyes wander to the pictures on the silky walls. I can\
  \ spot some yellowed wedding photos. The majority, however, always shows the same\
  \ motive: A boy on a bike, a train, a beach. Finally, I see that there is two of\
  \ me with the same boy, a few years later, in a different country. The smell of\
  \ jasmine rice and ginger fills the air. The radio in the background plays a new\
  \ year countdown and I can hear the sizzling meat in the wok. Within a day, I feel\
  \ home."
