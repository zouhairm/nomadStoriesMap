Text: "Convicted. Grateful. Overwhelmed. These were my first three words to social\
  \ media followers after returning from my two-week pilgrimage through Israel. My\
  \ journey through what we Christians call the \u201CHoly Land\u201D began even before\
  \ arriving in Tel Aviv. Like many resolution-makers, I created a 2018 \u201Cword\
  \ of the year.\u201D Mine was \u201CYes.\u201D My hope: focus on saying \u201Cyes\u201D\
  \ to the right things - the experiences, conversations and adventures that bring\
  \ me fulfillment and joy. \n\nShortly after arriving in Israel, we visited the Church\
  \ of the Annunciation, where angel Gabriel appeared to Mary to tell her that she\
  \ would become the Mother of God. We moved from the grand basilica down to a small,\
  \ stoney, cave-like space behind a gate. Our guide said \u201CHERE the Word was\
  \ made flesh.\u201D My heart stirred. Mary said \u201CYes\u201D here, in this precise\
  \ place. Yes. The word that\u2019s been on my mind since the start of the year.\
  \ It was so early in our journey yet I felt my heart tugging: \u201CWhat do I need\
  \ to say yes to in life?\u201D While I wasn\u2019t sure of the answer, I felt strong\
  \ conviction. \n\nAnd then there was the Sea of Galilee, \u201Cmy happy place.\u201D\
  \ We boarded a large wooden boat and set sail on the sea, in all of its vastness.\
  \ After reaching the center of the sea, our captain cut the motor and around we\
  \ swirled. I sat on the stern of the boat in silence and stillness, reflecting on\
  \ this place, this water and the peace that flooded my whole being. A deep sense\
  \ of gratitude swelled within me. \n\nWe spent the remaining days of our pilgrimage\
  \ in Jerusalem. I had the privilege of many spiritual encounters in the Church of\
  \ the Holy Sepulchre: ascending the stairs to Calvary, feeling the space which once\
  \ held Jesus\u2019 Cross, laying my hands upon the anointing stone and celebrating\
  \ Mass in the Jesus\u2019 tomb. \u201CJesus. Rose. From. Here.\u201D I repeated\
  \ this over and over to fully grasp the moment and what was happening in my midst.\
  \ There was no question, my heart was overwhelmed in Jerusalem; Overwhelmed by perspective,\
  \ love of Jesus and faith in the future.\n\nIn reflecting on the beautiful sites\
  \ and spiritual moments I experienced in Israel, I feel called to bring other Christians\
  \ to the Holy Land: to walk the streets, sail the seas and pray in the same spaces\
  \ as the One we\u2019ve read about our whole lives. I\u2019m committed to make this\
  \ new-found dream a reality. I never expected my yes to a two-week pilgrimage to\
  \ influence my life so profoundly. Today, I am convicted, grateful, overwhelmed,\
  \ and I\u2019m saying \u201CYes!\u201D"
