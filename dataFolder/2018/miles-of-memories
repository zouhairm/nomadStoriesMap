Text: "Preparing for our trip, my family packed up our forest green, 38 foot RV and\
  \ started to drive from cold and snowy Wisconsin, to warm and sunny Arizona. An\
  \ hour in, it started to snow. The small snow flurries, turned into a massive snow\
  \ storm. In no way were we prepared for this, and neither was the RV. As it became\
  \ dark, it became hard to see. As it got cold the windshield wipers couldn\u2019\
  t keep up. Going down the highway at 30 mph, pulling over every ten minutes to shake\
  \ off the frozen chunks on the windshield wipers.\nThe next day, we woke up with\
  \ beautiful weather and were able to explore a little. Then it was time to hit the\
  \ road once again. It was smooth sailing until \u201CBOOM!\u201D We blew out a tire.\
  \ We were in the middle of nowhere, sitting on the side of the road for two hours,\
  \ waiting for a mechanic to come change our tire. Since we felt the situation was\
  \ fitting, we watched our favorite road trip movie, RV. If you have every seen the\
  \ movie RV, I am sure you got some good chuckles when the endless things went wrong.\n\
  That night we all prayed this was the last of our own catastrophic RV movie. Waking\
  \ up, we hit the road for the last time before arriving. Not too far down the road,\
  \ there was a huge thud on the side of our RV. This time it wasn\u2019t a tire,\
  \ it was the canopy that came unhooked and was flopping around in the wind like\
  \ a fish on shore.\nTwo hours from our destination, everything was going perfect,\
  \ until we heard the dreaded, \u201CKABOOM!\u201D After pulling over once again\
  \ we had blew out another tire, but this time the side of the RV with it. When the\
  \ mechanic came to fix the tire he realized that when the tire blew it hit the tire\
  \ on the other side.\nArriving at our destination, we all needed this time to rest\
  \ and forget the stress of our drive here. On the track back home, all was good\
  \ until Kansas. With nothing but farm field for miles, our Rv started to slow down\
  \ till it quit on us. A nice man, towed us off onto his land so we were not on the\
  \ highway. After three days in a hotel, we were on the road again.\nNot everything\
  \ will always go as planned but,  if you keep a smile on your face, you can still\
  \ make the best memories. With all the time we spent sitting on the road, we got\
  \ more time to make memories as a family doing little things. We didn\u2019t miss\
  \ out on making memories, we just created them in a different way. We still got\
  \ to see many places and it was one of the best trips yet. In the long run, your\
  \ attitude will determine the fate of your fun."
