Text: "It is Oct. 2017 and I\u2019m in BC Canada in the middle of nowhere, 2 driving\
  \ hours away from the next small town. \nFew weeks ago on my ride to the Chilcotin\
  \ Mountains I was overwhelmed from the country I saw and the honour I got, to discover\
  \ this unique world. The place where the tribe of the Tsilhqot'in aboriginal people\
  \ have their roots.\nThis landscape brought me back into the time of the wild west,\
  \ the time when North America was undiscovered.\nThe gravel road, the knowledge\
  \ that here are cougars and the fact that a grizzly mom with her 3 cubs was walking\
  \ along my road - in those minutes in my head popped up the big question: \u201C\
  What I\u2019m going to do here? Alone, in my cute, little car and without any cell\
  \ service for the next 90 minutes?\u201D\nThe last sunbeams over the ranch are already\
  \ gone when my boss asked me for a talk. He is about to offer me a horse backpack\
  \ hunting trip!\nIt is early morning and we have to start to pack 2 horses with\
  \ equipment and food supplies, enough to survive for the next days. Our goal is\
  \ to reach out a ordinary cabin in the Shulap Mountains which is in the rough back\
  \ country.\nMy trusty companion is \u201CTippie\u201D armed with high boots, warm\
  \ clothes and what else - my cowboy hat the journey can begin. After a long ride\
  \ up to our cabin without running water and heat, I\u2019m joyful I managed the\
  \ ride with Tippie on a small path with leading a packhorse in addition. The way\
  \ up to our place was very steep, we went through a lot of trees on the wayside\
  \ and through creeks.\nShortly as we arrived we were surrounded from pine trees\
  \ and we got into snow and there on a small hill there was, our beautiful, cute\
  \ wood cabin.\nWe made a cozy fire and fetched water from the creek so we could\
  \ warm up by a cup of tea.\nFulfilled of excitement how our 8 hour trip will go\
  \ I fall into a deep sleep.\nIt\u2019s early morning and still dark outside. I start\
  \ to make breakfast for us, eggs, bacon and a ordinary but delicious cowboy coffee.\
  \ The nature here makes us speechless and we enjoying the view over the mountains\
  \ and riding through the creeks. It is a hard ride on small paths and sometimes\
  \ it goes very deeply down beside the paths, but our horses are trustworthy. Now\
  \ we make a stop and fix the bridle on big stones. For us opened a fascinating view,\
  \ over rough brown, red coloured mountains. We can see the valley with his incredible\
  \ milky turquoise lakes. Our stop for a break is here and we watching some sheep\
  \ before we decamp to our cabin luckily with the sunset forward us."
