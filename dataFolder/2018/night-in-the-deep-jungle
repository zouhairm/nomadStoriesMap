Text: It was in the month of august with my sister saw the beautiful top of kumaraparvatha
  peak from bisile ghat view point which is located in the western ghats of india
  ,got to know it was the toughest peak for the trekkers with 14 kms one side and
  28 kms round trek ,an altitude of 1748 m above sea level.I decided make it in top
  and prepared for 5 months .In the month of january planned for trekking kumaraparvatha
  with seven friends. Kukke subramanya temple was the base for trekking ,we started
  the trekking in the evening 4 pm.It was the first trekking for all of us,we went
  on for 5.5 kms through the thick jungle and reached the forest office around 6:30
  pm,there is only one homestay in the middle of the jungle which feeds us food and
  shelter,we camped near the forest office as night trekking was not allowed due to
  wildlife in the top of the peak .But i had a different plan that is getting up early
  and trekking in the night to watch sunrise,my friends agreed to it.As it was first
  trekking we were unaware of route,but hiking trials were there and we continued
  to move on the trial with groups and google maps,we started at 3 am from forest
  office without making noise,it was too dark outside as it was the day after new
  moon,the sky was full of stars.We went in the mobile screen brightness as if the
  guards notices us then we will be fired.After reaching 4 kms from forest office,
  the inclination towards the peak was getting worse that is more than 60 degrees
  for about 3 kms,all were exhausted but still the hunger to watch the sunrise made
  us to climb.Due to slow climbing speeds we were divided into two groups of four
  ,i was leading one group.After reaching a point there were two hiking trials our
  group went into the deep jungle the other group was very slow,after walking for
  20 mins i got to know that we have entered the wrong route and waited for the other
  group but they followed the right route by climbing ahead, then i came back searching
  them but couldn't find them and went again in the same jungle route and told my
  group and made a decision of going in the direction of the hiking trial to the peak,some
  how we reached the peak at 7:30 am but the other group reached the peak at 6:30
  am and the sunrise was at 7 am that day.I misled my group to thick forest and got
  escaped them again by guiding them which to the right route.Because of my decision
  we were at the edge of losing ourselves in the deep jungle.
