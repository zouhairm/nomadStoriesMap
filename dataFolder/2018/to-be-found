Text: "There i was at the edge of a beautiful cliff ,i could see the entire city and\
  \ the vast blue sky .I had never felt so alive and so accepted .\nBut what brought\
  \ me here was the will to get lost ,to not be recognised .To travel to a world far\
  \ across and just be alone .It all started with my dream job ,yeah my dream job\
  \ which i wanted more than anything else in my life got me to a point of not existing\
  \ anymore . That's what people talk about i guess that dreams change ,people change\
  \ and does their needs .\nI was happy when i got my job ,a company apartment and\
  \ a car .The perfect life as some may say and so did I .But after an year of living\
  \ that perfect life i felt usual no driving force to wake me up and feel this rush\
  \ of blood .What else would i aspire for ? More money ? bigger house ? bigger car\
  \ ? And then what again the same feeling .\nI thought love could change this but\
  \ the whole point was the work didn't make me happy ,i felt claustrophobic inside\
  \ those four walls of my cabin which bdw had the tag of senior analyst on the door.\n\
  It was the usual working day and as the people who cared about me suggested that\
  \ i should start some physical activity .I started my walk from work to home .\n\
  It was a lousy summer evening and everyone around me seemed happy to be done for\
  \ the day ,I think people seem more happy and fulfilled when you yourself are not\
  \ ! \nI kept walking and in distance i heard this man laughing ,not at someone or\
  \ something just laughing out loud everyone passed by ignoring but i found that\
  \ sound irritating its like his happiness annoyed me ,So i went to him and asked\
  \ \"what makes you laugh ?\"\nhe replied \"how people are so driven by their idea\
  \ of a happy life \" And he laughed again .\nI asked \"What do you think is a happy\
  \ life ?\"\nHe said \"When your emotions are not bound by reasons ,they are as free\
  \ as your soul !\"\nI asked \"What do you do ? \"\nHe said \"I live , wherever i\
  \ feel accepted .I wake up lost every morning but i make sure i sleep being found\
  \ !\"\nI don't think his words were divine intervention or some sort of a sign for\
  \ me but it was just a mere coincidence ,i got answers to my never arising hypothetical\
  \ questions .And i found my drive again,My calling for a new destination ,a new\
  \ home to get completely lost and then to be finally found .\nI packed my bags and\
  \ left for Slovakia .I had no idea what the place would be like but the not knowing\
  \ had never felt more exciting ,the thought of getting lost in the game of hide\
  \ & seek and then to be found."
