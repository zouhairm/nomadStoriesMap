Text: "The last thing I expected was love. That was 15 years ago. \nMy family was\
  \ then based in Norway, working hard, ploughing through days. I went to the first\
  \ grade, still fully standing in the ground of life, awaiting for nothing, tranquil.\
  \ One day we headed there \u2013 to Verdens Ende or Tj\xF8me, in English \u2013\
  \ to the World\u2019s End. But what was planned as a mere outing turned out a story\
  \ far more elaborate with a road to the Edge becoming a road Plus Ultra.\nReviving\
  \ that day in memories, I know there could not have been another way to walk into\
  \ the future, another occasion to read those dicta, inscribed across the skies,\
  \ previously clouded or misted, to open a door into what seemed unattainable realm,\
  \ to hear the elements praying, while all left to myself, to be that whole moment,\
  \ whole life. \nOn a cliff edge, I desperately I longed for a jump. Not to kill\
  \ myself, no, \u2013 to live. But, constrained by my own biology, was staying still,\
  \ watching late stars navigating the heavens, soundtracked by the heartbeat. Staying,\
  \ inhaling that here, that love. And the world too, it was staying still as if holding\
  \ its breath, patient with the rest of the creatures, inviting me to his embrace.\
  \ For however brief a span, that was an act of love with life. \nI have never experienced\
  \ it since and never expected \u2013 such indescribable wedge of freedom, that path,\
  \ I saw in a glimpse, stretching on, that wholehearted feeling both inside me and\
  \ far beyond \u2013 it does not come twice. New years brought new love, but that\
  \ was another love \u2013 imprisoning, not liberating. And so I lived, abandoned\
  \ by the horizon, at war with the reality, seeing no thresholds and, therefore,\
  \ reaching none. \nAnd then was yesterday. Ordinary Saturday, February the 24th.\
  \ On a journey through Portugal \u2013 new stop, Cabo da Roca, in life \u2013 another\
  \ heat of love. Again out of the blue, or rather out of the white noise of familiar\
  \ emotions. This time on a cliff edge, with soil turning into the sea and soul finding\
  \ its way to tread over the waves, I finally got it \u2013 arrival is a return and\
  \ the way ahead is the way I have come. My love quest was nothing with love having\
  \ no destination hiding in a mere endeavor to aspire, and what I have yearned for\
  \ so hard, I have already acquired for good \u2013 since my first cliff edge, love\
  \ has always been there. \nThe last thing I expected was love. It happened yesterday,\
  \ just like 15 years ago, and suddenly tainted every other day of my life. I hope\
  \ it will not flee me today. Hope it never will."
