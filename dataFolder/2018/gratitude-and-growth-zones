Text: "I blink my eyes as dust swirls through the half-opened window. The intrusive\
  \ smell of overpopulated streets and lack of sanitation system hasn\u2019t yet become\
  \ familiar to me. How do people drive in this traffic? The locals take honking as\
  \ a favor. I came a long way to find my life purpose here in Nepal. Now here I am,\
  \ ready to find out what \u201Creal\u201D survival skills are all about. Who am\
  \ I and what am I seeking? I squeeze my backpack a little closer and take a deep\
  \ breath. We have arrived at the starting point of our trek to Bhairav Kunda. I\
  \ am ready.\nI feel sweat binding my backpack to my back and I smell of sweaty curry.\
  \ The typical meal here consists of lentils and rice, perfect for days spent in\
  \ the Himalayas. We just passed a village where the locals let us use their charna\
  \ [bathroom] and sent us off with smiles and prayer hands. The people here are so\
  \ joyful inside \u2013 their heartbeats ring a sweet tune that I feel a part of.\
  \ This distracts me from the intense spinal aches I\u2019ve been feeling. \nI am\
  \ in a real personal pain cave. I just threw up blood and am navigating my way to\
  \ my tent. My American stomach can\u2019t handle unfiltered water, and I recollect\
  \ the iced coffee I had back in Katmandu. This is the last thing that I expected.\
  \ My tent buddy rubs my sweaty forehead with a damp shirt. I gotta make it to our\
  \ destination. This is what I came here for and you bet your last protein bar I\
  \ won\u2019t leave without doing so.\nI\u2019m huddled next to my Nepali brother.\
  \ He keeps looking at me with a, \u201Cwhat did you get yourself into, didi?\u201D\
  \ look. I pass about 15 lbs. of my gear on to him. The sunrise gives me a sip of\
  \ determination, so I stand up and snap my buckles around my waist.\nThe sun is\
  \ setting and all I can think about is getting to the hermitage. My feet are soaked\
  \ raw. Step-after-step, I ask myself if this is what I signed up for. We arrive,\
  \ I lay out my sleeping bag and drift to sleep.\nI wake up to pouring monsoon rain.\
  \ I must get to the bathroom now, so I grab my flip flops. I look over and my Nepali\
  \ brother nudged me to give him my socks. He kept them in his sleeping bag until\
  \ I got back. I doze off with warm feet and a thankful heart. \nI wake up feeling\
  \ crisp and bundle up to hike the ridgeway of the holy lake. I glance at the colorful\
  \ prayer flags - I see that it wasn\u2019t reaching my destination that would give\
  \ me what I\u2019ve been searching for. The secret is that I am the destination.\
  \ No matter where I adventure I will have warm socks, gratitude, and growth zones."
