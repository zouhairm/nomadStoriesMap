Text: "Flashback to the year 2002.  My scholarships in college were used up;  I felt\
  \ lost, bored, and ready for something new.  A friend of mine was moving up to Alaska\
  \ to be near her sister.  I made the life-altering decision to ride along.  It was\
  \ something different, and it sounded exciting.  I couldn't have been more right.\
  \  We packed up as much of our lives as we could in her small car, and headed north.\n\
  \     On the drive up through Canada, I saw the most beautiful display of the Northern\
  \ Lights for the first time and the best showing of them I have seen since.  Cars\
  \ were pulling over left and right off the road;  everyone felt the need to stop\
  \ to see the wonder before them.  I saw every color possible;  the greens, pinks,\
  \ blues, violets, and whites were fading and morphing together in a pulsing energy\
  \ that had me transfixed.  It was like I had taken some new, strange sort of drug,\
  \ all the while knowing I hadn't taken anything at all.  I knew right then, this\
  \ trip was going to be unlike anything I had ever experienced.  I grew up in Michigan,\
  \ and while having visited a lot of states in the \"lower 48,\" (as the Alaskans\
  \ call it) the adventure I was about to embark upon hasn't came close to anything\
  \ I've lived through since.  \n     Parts of the Alaska highway were not even developed\
  \ yet, and there came a couple of times where we had to stop the car, and wait in\
  \ the dusty nothingness until a \"guide\" showed up and lit the way down the dark\
  \ and dirty pathways.  Just the trip alone was super exciting, and Canada held many\
  \ beautiful sights.  The terrain up there was like nothing I had ever seen, with\
  \ it's sloping, lush, mountain-like curves and terrific bodies of water.  \n   \
  \   One of the most scenic drives in the USA lies here;  the Seward Highway, where\
  \ you are surrounded by mountains and the waters of Turnagain Arm.  Make some stops\
  \ and you can spot goats up in the mountains and crawl along the slippery boulders\
  \ on the shore. You are constantly reminded of how small humankind is in the great\
  \ scope of things. Camping and hiking in this state are beyond compare.  One of\
  \ my favorite spots to camp was in Homer, Alaska, which is about 200 miles south\
  \ of Anchorage.  On the way there you will see sheer drops that you can gaze down\
  \ in to, and lush mountains that have waterfalls spouting off of them.  Many times\
  \ you will drive by signs warning of occasional rock slides, which just adds to\
  \ the excitement.  If you have not been there, I highly recommend it!"
