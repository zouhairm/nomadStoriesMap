Text: "I\u2019d always dreamed of living in New York City.\L\L T.V shows and movies\
  \ from the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s enchanted me with its bright city lights, colorful\
  \ characters, cultural diversity, and the promise that the city never slept much\
  \ like myself. After moving from Chicago to a quiet suburban town on the cities\
  \ outskirts, life lacked excitement and couldn\u2019t grant me the catharsis I had\
  \ hoped to receive from living in the Empire State. I would soon have that wish\
  \ granted\u2014much to my dismay.\n\nMy first real steps in the concrete jungle\
  \ were met by the smell of garbage, Jamaican cuisine, marijuana, and gunshots shortly\
  \ after. It was undoubtedly the very heart of Brooklyn. I remember hiding behind\
  \ a broken down van and laughing at the situation with my girlfriend at the time,\
  \ as it was nothing out of the ordinary for either of us. This was her home after\
  \ all and the only reason I'd been there.\n\n\u201CBed Stuy, do or die,\u201D she\
  \ prodded jokingly to me.\nApparently, it was the neighborhood motto for reasons\
  \ I easily deduced without needing to ask.\n\nAs a former introvert who was frequently\
  \ ostracized for being an anti-social weirdo, the all-new \"broken out of my shell\"\
  \ me was ready for grand experiences regardless of my ignorance to the harsh realities\
  \ waiting for me.\n\nAfter 3 months of hustle and bustle, getting mugged, racially\
  \ profiled, and nearly arrested on false pretense, we finally escaped to Manhattan.\
  \ My bias towards the borough would see to it that I thought it was all worth it.\
  \ \n\nDespite all the great things that others had told me were true about Manhattan,\
  \ everything that was terrible about it stood out like a beacon of light in the\
  \ darkest void of space.\nMoney was the common tongue in Manhattan, and I was a\
  \ baby still learning how to say \"mama.\" \n\nThe rent was %80 of my monthly income.\
  \ Insanity plus tax.\n\nThe reality was a hard pill to swallow and the relationship\
  \ ultimately suffered because of it. After a year, the toxicity between two souls\
  \ would be the catalyst for the hardest two months I'd ever experienced in my life\u2014\
  homeless on the streets of NYC.\n\nI was reluctant to see the irony of it all; that\
  \ here I was in the city of my dreams, now living a nightmare. Homelessness humbles\
  \ you in ways you would never imagine, yet most people are afraid to admit how judgemental\
  \ they are when they see vagrants asking for your change outside the grocery store.\
  \ Since that time, I've never looked at a pillow or park bench the same way again."
