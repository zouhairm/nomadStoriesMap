Text: "\u201CHis face is that of a lion. When he looks at someone, it is the look\
  \ of death.\_Humbaba's roar is a flood, his mouth is death and his breath is fire!\u201D\
  \n\nThat is how the demi-god and terror unto humanity\_is described in the Epic\
  \ of\_Gilgamesh,\_regarded as the oldest literary work in the world.\n\nA brief\
  \ 4113 years later, an easy-going American\_behind a bar on Otres beach, Sinanuohkville,\
  \ described him slightly differently: \"a god or somethin\u2019. Used to go around\
  \ ripping peoples heads off.\" He chuckled and shot a bashful smile at the age-old\_\
  giant's namesake, who bluntly replied by taking a piss on the bar and brazenly stealing\
  \ a sip of my Sprite.\n\nI hadn\u2019t met a bar dwelling bunny before chancing\
  \ upon this humble beach shack, nor have I since.\_If I only meet one I am glad\
  \ it was him, I am glad it was there. \u201CBlame Canada\u201D was a gem; glorious\
  \ views of the sunset over an empty beach, cheap beer, good conversation.\n\nIt\
  \ may seem amiss to visit a bar with a decisively western\_name whilst exploring\
  \ Cambodia.\_I certainly felt it was, but my hostel was a fair distance from town\_\
  and the only transport available\_was a cheerful local with an aged scooter I could\
  \ perch on the back of. Most would say this is easy; I did not do well.\n\nWe travelled\
  \ maybe a hundred yards before I\_fell off.\_I screamed.\_I elected instead to walk\
  \ the local\u2019s laughter off to the nearest bar I could find.\n\nThus I met Humbaba.\
  \ Roughly the size of a coconut, but a lot softer, he was a charmer from the off.\n\
  \nA dominant part of his personality was his merry use of the bar as his personal\
  \ privy. I understand the hygiene issues this raises. However, it came across as\
  \ far more endearing than unpleasant, one of the advantages of being all white fluff\
  \ and floppy ears.\n\nThe barman, Mike, struggled through futile attempts to house-train\
  \ Humbaba, often picking him up and rubbing his face in his mess.\n\nI objected.\
  \ Humbaba barely seemed to notice.\n\nHe\_would\_come straight over, look at me,\
  \ my drink, me, my drink. Nudge.\_I caved, shared a drop and so the vicious cycle\
  \ continued\u2026 Clear proof I won't be a\_strict parent.\n\nHumbaba earned his\
  \ name. Three kittens hung out at the shack whom he duly punished should they entertain\
  \ the idea of sharing his\_bar. He bolted like a bunny out of hell to tackle the\
  \ feline intruders, scattering them like skittles. My allergies and I praised his\
  \ swift deliverance.\n\nWe share many passions: showing off, copious drinking, going\
  \ to the toilet, loathing cats\u2026 I met a soulmate in Cambodia. I never saw it\
  \ coming."
