Text: "In northern Finland, for centuries the traditional way of living was nomadic\
  \ and revolved around reindeer herding. These days the region\u2019s reindeer keepers\
  \ no longer live life on the move, but they still form a close-knit community that\
  \ values its heritage. I visited a reindeer farm on the outskirts of Kuusamo, a\
  \ small town in the Northern Ostrobothnia region close to the Russian border, to\
  \ find out how the tradition is kept alive.\nSatu Palosaari, a petite blonde woman\
  \ with a big, warm smile, has been running the family farming business with her\
  \ husband since her father retired a decade ago. She is a sixth generation reindeer\
  \ keeper and still lives on the farm she grew up on, founded by her grandfather\
  \ in 1920. \nI find this out during a walk through the snow-draped woodland where\
  \ the herd is fenced in during winter. Grazing on hay in the dappled sunshine, the\
  \ reindeer seem utterly content. They are beautiful and soulful, just like their\
  \ natural habitat. \nEven more spectacular than the scenery is the stillness that\
  \ surrounds us \u2013 a rarity for a city dweller like me. I take off my woolly\
  \ hat to enjoy it more fully, assuming Satu must find this funny \u2013 but as it\
  \ turns out she is as much in awe of the serenity herself. \u201CI often come out\
  \ here just to take in the peace and quiet,\u201D she tells me.\nShe doesn\u2019\
  t know if one of her four children will one day take over the business, but carrying\
  \ on the family tradition is not the only concern Satu has regarding the farm\u2019\
  s future. There is debate over whether the region\u2019s reindeer should be kept\
  \ in paddocks all year round, freeing up vast areas of land where the herds roam\
  \ free in the summer for more lucrative purposes, such as mining. \nSatu has no\
  \ doubts about where she stands on the issue. \u201CI would rather close down the\
  \ business than keep my reindeer permanently fenced in,\u201D she says.\nShe remains\
  \ hopeful it won\u2019t come to that though and, in any case, if there is one thing\
  \ living in the Finnish wilderness teaches you, it\u2019s survival skills.\nAs we\
  \ part, it strikes me just how many new experiences I have had in the space of an\
  \ afternoon. Aside from indulging my thirst for adventure, I\u2019ve met someone\
  \ whose life couldn\u2019t be more different to mine, but with whom I quickly found\
  \ common ground. \nUltimately, the point of travelling \u2013 of being a modern-day\
  \ nomad \u2013 is not just to make memories, but also to be reminded that regardless\
  \ of where we are from or what we do for a living, our similarities far outweigh\
  \ our differences."
