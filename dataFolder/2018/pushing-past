Text: "\"Why do you care so much?\" John spat at me.\n\nI was shaken awake from my\
  \ gazing of the tall makeshift dock and the mesmerizing the blue water beneath it.\
  \ The dock that held firm against the waves and the sun that relentlessly beat down\
  \ on it. \n\nJohn scoffed and walked away as I opened my mouth to respond. A pang\
  \ of guilt came over me. He wasn't the first to take offense at my excitement. Every\
  \ smile at the name of a new place, every gasp of awe at the mountainous locks we\
  \ navigated through had been met with jeers and glares. What they didn't know was\
  \ that this cruise ship job was the best thing that ever happened to me. If John\
  \ knew, he would have more than just scoffs I'm sure. \nHis comments and others\
  \ swam through my head like the currents beneath me. Now climbing up the makeshift\
  \ dock, the shine of the sun replaced with the glint of the moon. \n\nMy hand slapped\
  \ water onto the wood, my toes slipping through the holds. Distant sounds of seagulls\
  \ carried over the silent waters of Block Island.\n\"This isn't that-\" my voice\
  \ caught in my throat as the cruise ship caught up to my line of sight.\n\nFixated\
  \ on the windows, trying to not look down before I took the plunge into the midnight\
  \ waters. The same decision making that brought me onto a plane to a place I knew\
  \ nothing about. To this edge that left a lump in my throat. Below were the shouts,\
  \ that 12 hours ago had been taunts. That were now outshining the sneers and derisiveness\
  \ of my fellow crew members. Shining into my soul the way the moonlight sunk into\
  \ the waters far beneath me.\nIn the berating, they achieved their goal. I had resigned\
  \ that morning. \n\nAt this moment I was supposed to be on a plane back home. Desperately\
  \ trying to make everything fit into my carry on because I couldn't afford checked\
  \ luggage.\n\nInstead I was here, hearing the cheers of those who had been silently\
  \ supporting me the whole time. Two voices, and a couple strangers who swam over\
  \ to investigate the commotion. The voices I'd been refusing to hear.\n\nI kicked\
  \ a leg, ceremoniously in front of me, followed by another. A scream piercing the\
  \ air, a moment before a splash. Cheers penetrating the water as I swam back into\
  \ the summer air. Surrounded by smiles and new friends, that managed to reach me\
  \ through the madness. I never did tell John why I cared so much, but the silent\
  \ voices didn't need to be told."
