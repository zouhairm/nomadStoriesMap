Text: "More injuries occur during any given descent than the climb up. The three-day\
  \ hike drenched my spirit more than the seven hours of cold mountain rain did the\
  \ thin wool shirt over my shivering bones. \u201CTake care, snow grass can be very\
  \ slippery when wet.\u201D \n\nOur canned chicken and soft shell tortilla feed got\
  \ the 58-kilometer hike rolling late in the day and carried us well into the night.\
  \ Hitchhiking as a pair had proven to be more time consuming than I had ever experienced\
  \ as an individual. \u201CBuy some deodorant!\u201D a voice shouted at our outstretched\
  \ thumbs. Ahead, Mount Awful and Mount Dreadful loomed splendidly in the distance,\
  \ their names unfitting in my fresh eyes.\n\nIt happened to be Valentine\u2019s\
  \ day. Far from the icy slush I grew up knowing, February brings life to the Southern\
  \ hemisphere. Teeming with lush green ferns and moss, delightful native bird calls,\
  \ and sweet earthy summer rains, the wild South Island of New Zealand easily wrapped\
  \ herself around me, calling me to be hers. By full moonlight, my bare feet found\
  \ the glacial river where I bathed after pitching the tent in the tall golden grass.\n\
  \nMy gift to him, a simple magpie feather, was striking in his long dark hair as\
  \ he walked ahead the following day. My unaccustomed legs became more aware of gravity\
  \ with the elevation and distance we were rapidly covering. The Englishman was extraordinarily\
  \ more prepared; it had been his purpose to hit as many of these five-star advanced\
  \ trails as he could for weeks. Inviting the American girl whose tent was pitched\
  \ near his at the six dollar pine sap covered campsite was some sort of coincidence\
  \ or fate. Either way, I was not ready. I would do it anyway.\n\nGlass knees wanted\
  \ to shatter after we finally breached the pass and began the long way down the\
  \ exposed, rocky mountainside. I gave into gravity after the long stick I\u2019\
  d picked up snapped, suddenly. The whimsical snow grass tufts carried my body over\
  \ rock faces and vertical short distance drop-offs, down. Gaining momentum, I looked\
  \ up and saw his yellow raincoat standing sentinel looking back. My heels and fingernails\
  \ dug into the earth and I tasted mortality. A meter more and I would have slipped\
  \ over the edge, too large a drop to pretend it would have been ok.\n\nMy life in\
  \ my own hands, I grasped the snow grass and regained my feet. I walked down the\
  \ mountain grateful for the pain in my knees."
