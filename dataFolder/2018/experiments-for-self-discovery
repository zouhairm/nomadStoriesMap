Text: "In early 2014 I came pretty close to committing suicide, there wasn't much\
  \ keeping me together except for football. Things got worse after I was told by\
  \ my psychiatrist that I was showing signs of early schizophrenia and might have\
  \ to be 'sent to an institution'.  What kept me from ending my life was the thought\
  \ of what my action might do to my family, who've loved me all through my life and\
  \ couldn't quit understand what had suddenly happened to the cheerful 18-year old.\
  \ I decided to pack my bags and run away from home, away from all that seemed to\
  \ add to my problems.\nI reached the New Delhi Railway Station with somewhere close\
  \ to 5,000 rupees and a couple of PlayStation games I'd planned on selling for when\
  \ I might run out. With no idea of where I was headed towards, I asked one of the\
  \ koolis (porters) of the next train that was to depart the station. It turned out\
  \ to be a train headed towards Bangalore, I got on the general compartment without\
  \ having bought a ticket (there was never going to any space for a ticket collector\
  \ to make it to that compartment) and traveled through the heart of India in that\
  \ train for about 30 hours with 10 strangers cramped up in what was originally supposed\
  \ to be a space for 4. We'd all switch between who would get to lay down on the\
  \ floor and sleep for half an hour, while the other 9 pairs of feet rest on the\
  \ rested. \nI never reached Bangalore, instead I got off when I couldn't take it\
  \ anymore, somewhere in the state of Maharashtra. Having spent the next few nights\
  \ on the streets, I made my way to Goa where I found myself (along with a bed and\
  \ a place to wash the dirty clothes I'd been carrying with me.\nI still remember\
  \ Vasco, Goa as that perfectly organised square in the heart of the party capital\
  \ of India, with the railway station opposite the post office and the market opposite\
  \ the unevenly arranged houses. In the middle of one of most humid months in the\
  \ country, I doubt many people know Goa the way I do. I remember that tiny winding\
  \ street across my room where I'd found that little bakery. I remember the taste\
  \ of the prawn patties I'd get for Rs. 10 each. I remember how I started reading,\
  \ having rented a book from the bookstore at the railway station and taking a bus\
  \ going nowhere in Goa to eventually come back 'home' to my room, with a bottle\
  \ of water in one corner and my clothes hanging out to dry. I felt slightly better\
  \ except for the guilt. I was caught by the police after a week there, I was gone\
  \ for a total of 2."
