Text: "It would really be the vacation I dreamed of! traveled to Peru! I could barely\
  \ contain myself with such anxiety after all. I dreamed about it my whole life!\
  \ \nIt all started when I was accessing the internet, looking vaguely at travel\
  \ sites, my eyes found an advertisement, I found a ticket at a great price, my parents\
  \ helped me and I was able to buy. I could hardly believe it! I got my trip from\
  \ my dreams. On the day of the trip, there I was, with my 3 beautiful silver suitcases,\
  \ my mother and father accompanied me on the trip. I remember as if it were today.\n\
  Every instant was magnificent. While I was inside the plane, I began to imagine\
  \ what the city was like, the people of that place, the language, imagining how\
  \ beautiful and perfect everything was. The first city I visited was Chiclayo is\
  \ a beautiful and welcoming city popularly called as the city of friendship. Pimentel\
  \ beach is 30 minutes from Chiclayo by taxi and is divided into an open area with\
  \ restaurants bars and fishermen. It has a different charm and has good eating options\
  \ and is quiet. The sunset is very beautiful. The second tourist place was the Huaca\
  \ Rajada Museum, is organized museum with incredible cultural richness. I visited\
  \ with a great guide and leave from there enchanted with the culture. Another place\
  \ was reserva de Chaparri, the reserve is amazing the plants, birds and animals.\
  \ It is very beautiful and a great break from any city! The rooms at the front were\
  \ very comfortable and the food was wonderful. Our guide was great, especially because\
  \ of his love and respect for the area. Dined in one of the best restaurants in\
  \ the neighborhood, the place was wonderful and the food was very tasty if it depended\
  \ on me going back every day.\nA week went by and I traveled to another city called\
  \ Huacho, a small and organized city, I visited Bandurria It is very interesting\
  \ and two pyramids have been almost completely restored. I visited El Colorado beach.\
  \ An excellent place, clean, spacious and calm waters, one of the best in Huacho,\
  \ a quiet place to sunbathe. I traveled to Lima, visited the museum Rafael Larco\
  \ Museum is worth to spend a little time there to get to know Peruvian history and\
  \ culture, the Inca people and also other people who lived in the region. I also\
  \ visited the Miraflores district enjoying a wonderful view, undoubtedly one of\
  \ the highlights of my trip to Lima. I visited Huaca Pucllana is within the district\
  \ of Miraflores. so it was a wonderful trip."
