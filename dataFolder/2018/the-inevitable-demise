Text: "Her blonde hair fell around her face framing a smile that stops time. In a\
  \ mediocre job, the type we all started in, I found a girl, the type of girl that\
  \ only comes along once in a life time. One asked to see the catalyst for change,\
  \ something that pushed me to the edge, this was it. Like all stories of young reckless\
  \ love it came to a brutal and damaging end. Fully aware of my own responsibility\
  \ in the demise of \u2018us\u2019 I stood in awe. She began her wedding plans to\
  \ someone else, I began my journey. A chance to follow dreams, drunken promises\
  \ and some friends who were previously discarded for my life with smiles. Resigning\
  \ from said mediocre job I took my redundancy like so many stories before mine and\
  \ just as unoriginal. With cameras in my face and tears on my families I boarded\
  \ the plane, bound for Europe, alone scared as hell hoping to find myself. London\
  \ was easy, fixing my international roaming when I landed was not. I spent many\
  \ a weird hour in an earls court phone booth using my mother as liaison with vodaphone\
  \ Australia to fix the situation. Berlin bound.I left the comforts of an English\
  \ speaking country. I had done minimal work to investigate their culture and way\
  \ of life. Prior to leaving the most I had done was purchase a \u2018learn to speak\
  \ German\u2019 CD. Much like the first day at school, I walked down to the local\
  \ \u2018lido\u2019 store. I lined up alongside locals with my bread, baked beans,\
  \ juice and what I thought was yoghurt (it was sour cream). I smiled politely as\
  \ the young lady scanned my groceries. In my ignorance I just nodded as she attempted\
  \ to start a conversation. I was out of my depth, what was I to do, what kind of\
  \ arrogant dick just stares blindly at someone as they talk to you. ICK KINE-N SPREKIN\
  \ KINE DUTCH I blurted out in the most unflattering way. In broken English from\
  \ behind I heard a man ask her why I would tell her I couldn\u2019t speak Dutch.\
  \ She just smiled and pointed at the price on the register. Red-faced and totally\
  \ mortified I met her smile with my own, paid, then exited in a fashion not that\
  \ unlike wile E coyote style cloud of smoke. Recounting the story later to friends\
  \ I was enlightened to the fact that Dutch and Deutsch are not in fact the same\
  \ sounding words. life gives us numerous opportunities, many of them we fail at.\
  \ it is these failures that push us in directions we never knew could be taken.\
  \ pushing us to what we think are our limits, only for us to find we have much further\
  \ to go."
