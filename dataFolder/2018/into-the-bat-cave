Text: "Underneath all the rich growth, dense jungle and century-old tree roots of\
  \ Semuc Champey lie the hidden Kam\u2019ba Caves. \n\nSemuc Champey is a highlight\
  \ of travellers to Guatemala, with its crystal cyan blue waters, exotic fish and\
  \ waterfalls. Yet, it\u2019s what is tucked away from plain view that is the true\
  \ highlight. For all those who dare to venture into the darkness of this underground\
  \ world, a truly unique adventure awaits.  \n\nAs I walk towards the cave entrance,\
  \ I close my eyes for a split second, mustering courage.\n\nOur guide hands each\
  \ of us in our group of twelve a fresh candlestick. Baffled, I stare down at this\
  \ thin white waxy twig between my fingers that is to light my way. A match is struck\
  \ and we tap candle-to-candle along our line until we are all alight. \n\nWe walk,\
  \ single file, into the cave. The cool ebony air is more hostile than I could have\
  \ imagined. Stale and musty. \n\nA few steps in, and I hear a splash up ahead. Water.\
  \ We\u2019re going to swim. My candle flickers as we tread forward into the biting\
  \ underground pool. \n\nThere are ropes to cling to. We pull ourselves along while\
  \ treading water, gripping the rope tight and keeping our candle raised above the\
  \ water line. I hear the soft swooping of bat wings.\n\nWe glide along and become\
  \ used to finding our footing, manoeuvring around tight corners and over submerged\
  \ boulders. \n\nWater rapidly gushes up ahead. We turn a corner and I see a rope\
  \ dangling from a waterfall. Our guide has already ascended and is calling for us\
  \ to follow. When it is my turn, I grip my soaked running shoes either side of the\
  \ rope and shimmy my way up. My candle extinguishes with a puff. \n\nExhilarated,\
  \ adrenaline pumps through my body. Little do I know how much I will need it. I\
  \ turn another corner to follow the light. My group has vanished. Only the guide\
  \ remains. He\u2019s standing over a hole in the ground. Water is running through\
  \ it. It is just big enough to fit a human body. \n\nThe guide ushers me over. Horrified,\
  \ I try to look down the hole. \u201CHow far down is it?\u201D I question. \u201C\
  Yes,\u201D he smiles and nods back. This is it. I either turn back or go down the\
  \ hole with everyone else. With a tremor, I make my choice.\n\nI grip the rock on\
  \ either side of the abyss and hold the guide\u2019s forearm as though my life is\
  \ in his hands. I let go. A classic pin-drop sees me falling through thin air for\
  \ what seems like several seconds. I land with a splash in deep water. It covers\
  \ my face and hair. I re-emerge, holding my candle up although it offers no light.\
  \ I\u2019ve made it."
