Text: Ghaaliya told me that peace was not only about silence. She said peace was the
  beauty of life. Ghaaliya was too wise for her age. I met her in the Marrakech Souk.
  A labyrinth of alleyways full of clothes, spices, food, crafts and all kind of typical
  products. During my second day in Marrakeh and from my window I could see her sitting
  among the people, dancing and selling. Ghaaliya walked by my hand whispering a song.
  Silence used to be for me the best way to get in touch with the soul, but when I
  found myself among the voice of Ghaaliya and the noise of  the people that spreads
  like foam, I was hypnotized. Nights are like days in spring. Forty degrees makes
  people sleep during the day and immerse themselves in the world at night. Walking
  among the beautiful objects with lot of perfumes and colors made me feel alive.
  Beyond the crystals and eager eyes of the people to finalized a sale, I saw the
  passion and intensity of the Morocco's people. Beyond feeling overwhelmed and insecure,
  I felt the love of strong and passionate people. The roar of a city with a lot to
  give to the world. It's about finding peace into chaos like Ghaaliya would said.
  Morocco caught me. I spent days delighting my body with mint tea, music and sounds.
  It was as if this city was waiting for me, with all its magic. Ghaaliya took my
  hand again giving me the strength and calm to withstand any chaos, appreciating
  every little detail that life had for me during the trip.
