Text: "Bosporian tombs and Genoese fortresses, tsars\u2019 palaces and national parks,\
  \ different climate zones, murderous battles, multiple religions and the heritage\
  \ of the most powerful empires. It is not a story of a continent. It\u2019s all\
  \ about a little land called Crimea\u2026\n\nThe Crimea is a small peninsula washed\
  \ by the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. It stretches from east to west for 326 kms\
  \ and only for 205 - from north to south. Not that much to be surprised, is it?\
  \ But still this place has got a lot to offer even to a seasoned traveler. \n\n\
  What a surprise it was when we realized it was not enough a fortnight tour to explore\
  \ all the places we had planned carefully before!  \n\nWhen you come here for the\
  \ first time you can experience different emotions, both pleasant and unpleasant\
  \ ones, but never boring. The lack of infrastructure and services, old soviet buildings\
  \ that are crying out for renovation you can easily compensate by fascinating landscapes\
  \ and turquoise sea waters, outstanding places of interest and splendid vineyards,\
  \ lots of possibilities for outdoor activities and ecological tourism. \nBut this\
  \ story is not about historical buildings or outdoor activities, not even about\
  \ the argument between the countries, but the things that amaze, that amazed me\
  \ most of all. \n\nIf you get bored watching the same scenery day by day during\
  \ your vacation and prefer diversity, the Crimea could be the right place for you.\
  \ Here, in one day while moving from east to west you can enjoy mountains and plants\
  \ that will remind you of South Africa\u2026 You stop at a view point on the serpentine\
  \ road, get out of the car and wait a little for a cheetah that jumps out from the\
  \ bushes and eats you up. Heading farther to the south you have got d\xE9j\xE0 vu.\
  \ Olive oils, that odor in the air... No, it is not Italy, wake up!  You are in\
  \ the Crimea. And then, within a few kilometers to Yalta you dive into exuberant\
  \ vegetation of subtropics\u2026  \nThe sun is going down slowly but you are moving\
  \ ahead, to Sevastopol. The mountains are not that green anymore and you can see\
  \ those high yellow brown rocks that stand like monuments or as if a giant cracked\
  \ them with a huge hammer. You are sleepy and tired and have just seen the mountains.\
  \ And then\u2026 What was it? Huge tumbleweed was rolling like a lightning across\
  \ the road risking to hit your car\u2026 Ufff  You are lucky.  And don\u2019t feel\
  \ like sleeping anymore. \n\nYou are in Yevpatoria. \n\n                       \
  \          To be continued\u2026"
