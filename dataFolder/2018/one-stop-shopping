Text: "On weekends I wake to the sound of a bicycle horn \u2013 not from traffic,\
  \ but the passing by of a woman who is a travelling convenience store of sorts,\
  \ candies and face masks hanging from her handlebars for sale. She doesn\u2019t\
  \ have many customers in my neighbourhood. This street is only a prelude to the\
  \ bustling wet market metres away, where plenty like her sell as many items as their\
  \ makeshift shop can fit. \n\nI follow her to the chaos with my own bicycle in tow.\
  \ As I hop on, my tire sinks into the ground out of air. I wave down people on their\
  \ way to the market, simulating a pumping motion with my hands and pointing frantically\
  \ at my tire, only to receive the odd looks of people simply on their way to do\
  \ their shopping.\n\nI wheeled my bicycle sheepishly to the spills of the market,\
  \ hoping to find an auto shop. But my resilience was proven otherwise as my arms\
  \ grew tired and face glossed over with sweat. I limped over to a vendor with an\
  \ array of skirts hanging from her tent and a splay of coconuts ready to be chopped.\
  \ The shop-owner looked over at me, curiously, as I blinked away sweat and pushed\
  \ down on my flat tire. With a laugh, she turned and called to a younger boy who\
  \ poked at the empty rubber. He left and came back with a few friends - soon enough,\
  \ the space was a party of young Khmer boys hovering over my bike. \n\nThe storefront\
  \ buzzed with a flurry of unorthodox tools coming and going -  lighters, coat hangers\
  \ and rubber tubes. All I needed was a pump, I tried to say, arms frantically miming\
  \ filling the tires with air. I was met with laughter and approached with patterns\
  \ of skirts to try on instead. The boys disappeared on a moto.\n\n\u201Cle\u2019\
  ung, khe\u2019ung, saart!\u201D The shop-owner said to me, pointing to her skirts\
  \ \u2013 \u201Cyellow, blue, beautiful!\u201D as I paced around my bike, still empty\
  \ of air. I tried on a few skirts  - \u201CI\u2019m already here, why not?\u201D\
  -  I thought between sips out of a coconut. Suddenly, the boys returned, waving\
  \ a pump in the air with whoops and hollers of success. \u201CSaart!\u201D they\
  \ said, motioning towards my skirt. As they brought the pump to my tire\u2019s valve,\
  \ I held the pump steady, cautious not to get my skirt dirty, as the sweet hiss\
  \ lifted my bicycle off the ground. \n\nMutual smiles were all around \u2013 khmer\
  \ boys for a job well done, shop-owner for another sold item, and me, with a fixed\
  \ bicycle, beautiful new skirt, and coconut in hand. I left a few thousands riels\
  \ as payment and rode off into the market, ready for whatever shopping I would do\
  \ next."
