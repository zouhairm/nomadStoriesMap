Text: "\u201CFire Ants\u201D Chito whispered, gesturing to the ground. \nWe spied\
  \ a trail of little red insects carrying bits of leaves in various different sizes\
  \ over a nearby log and up a tree. \nHe explained that as a child, punishment for\
  \ misbehaviour was being strapped to a fire ant tree, and left there until a sufficient\
  \ amount of bites had been received. \n\nThere was something in Chitos voice that\
  \ made everything sound magical. Curly mop of hair, big lips, skin like weathered\
  \ wood. He had a small wooden pipe he puffed at perennially, clasped between his\
  \ finger and his thumb. \n\nWe had been in the jungle for four days. We had arrived\
  \ here by 12 hour car descent and catamaran, to Manu National Park, a UNESCO World\
  \ Heritage site. Nearly two million hectares of the most biodiverse environment\
  \ in the world, much of it protected. We had managed to find ourselves in the Reserved\
  \ Zone, penetrable only by certified guide, which in our case was Chito. He told\
  \ us of the wonders encased within The Core Zone; animals, insects, monkeys, and\
  \ even wild tribes that had been unseen or uncontacted for 150 years. Since 1970,\
  \ the Peruvian government had been fighting to protect it against illegal logging,\
  \ deforestation, and the wild tribes to their own weak immune systems.\n\nChito\
  \ had grown up in the town of Boca Manu, right near The Amazon Basin. He had been\
  \ working in the tourism industry his whole life, ferrying westerners to and fro\
  \ through the forest.\n\nHe seemed to be dialled into the frequency of the jungle\
  \ on a permanent basis. On our walks, he would stand, two fingers in the air, listening.\
  \ Then he would point at wonders previously unseen; a couplet of strange birds,\
  \ a snake retreating into the distance, a wild bush turkey scratching for food.\
  \ \n\nAt night we stayed in huts with candles that blew out and no electricity,\
  \ listening only to the roar of the jungle, which until I had witnessed it, I couldn\u2019\
  t have imagined. We would sit in the canopy, feeling the peculiar feel of body against\
  \ body, in complete darkness, with only the dim glow of Chitos pipe as he told stories\
  \ of the jungle. \n\nIt was the last day we were to spend in this particular splendour,\
  \ and we had just returned to camp. I went barefoot to wash my feet in the stream\
  \ nearby. A white, hot, searing pain shot through my foot like a needle and I screamed\
  \ with profanity so diverse the Amazon would be proud of me.  \nChito inspected\
  \ my foot with an air of derision. His shamanic assessment was the solitary bite\
  \ of a single fire ant."
