Text: "I pull the throttle of my Honda Win for the fourth time in a row. Still no\
  \ luck. Both my feet are planted on rocks either side of my bike; ensuring I don\u2019\
  t begin to roll back down the steep incline. \u201CFAAARRRK! JAAAAACOB! COME DOWN\
  \ HERE!\u201D My friend Stew is roughly twenty metres behind and more stuck than\
  \ I by the sound of things. All I can see is his headlight and the muddy track it\
  \ illuminates.\n\n\u201CHANG ON! I can\u2019t move right now!\u201D Time is running\
  \ out. I begin to calculate the current situation; we\u2019re in the middle of a\
  \ Vietnamese jungle, miles from the nearest town, the sun has set (well and truly)\
  \ and our bikes have reached their limits. Could we be any further from home? \n\
  \nSuddenly, below Stew, a light begins to shine and the sound of an engine amplifies.\
  \ He\u2019s back. We'd met him just two hours earlier, as the day was coming to\
  \ a close. Having started that morning in Sapa, we\u2019d covered three quarters\
  \ of a 240km ride to Ha Giang; far north Vietnam. As we admire the rice fields sitting\
  \ below the peaks, Stew dishes out a wave to a passing bike. The man comes to a\
  \ halt. His English is okay and he points out a couple of distant peaks, \u201C\
  China\u201D. I begin to take some snaps, drifting from the conversation.\n \n\u201C\
  He says we\u2019ve got another hour. Let's go man!\u201D By the time I reach the\
  \ two of them, a proposition has been made; the man has offered us a bed at his\
  \ place. Hungry for a taste of local life, we agree, and begin to follow \u2018\
  Tea\u2019 in the direction we\u2019d come from. As we twist around the mountains,\
  \ the last glimmer of daylight disappears. I really hope it\u2019s not much further.\
  \ Tea then indicates right and pulls off the main road. Thank god. \n\nA metre-wide\
  \ track composed of rock and mud confronts us. I was wrong. Fast forward thirty\
  \ minutes and we\u2019ve made it a mere 300 metres with Tea riding each of our bikes\
  \ one at a time. He isn\u2019t able to sympathise with our concern, which escalates\
  \ rapidly as we cross a feeble bridge. We can only hear the river gushing below\
  \ and I can\u2019t help but wonder how far the drop is. When Tea drives ahead, I\
  \ query Stew about his motives, which is when we decide to turn back. \n\nSuddenly,\
  \ it feels as though we're being chased. Back across the bridge. Up and down the\
  \ cliff like path. We're so close, but he catches us. \n\nHe'd gone ahead to get\
  \ his brothers help and without much choice, the longest day of our journey ends\
  \ at their house, where we indulge in a home cooked meal and share beer after beer.\
  \ \n\nWhat were we ever so worried about..."
