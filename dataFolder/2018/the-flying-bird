Text: "I put on my white clothes, tried to hide my pale eyes and sat aimlessly.\n\n\
  The last time I was in Kabul, I was on a solo trip and things were much more joyous\
  \ as I explored his city with him. Today, it was crisp with silence. Or maybe, I\
  \ couldn't hear anything but the deafening silence of his complete absence.\n\n\
  It was in that trip, that Aalim and I had gotten closer to each other. He was a\
  \ tall and scrawny boy, with disheveled hair running into his tender black eyes\
  \ that were immersed in the torn pages of a book, when I first saw him.\nThere were\
  \ children playing around the lake, with dirty faces and ragged clothes, fooling\
  \ around as if their world was of just a few miles and a few breaths in and around.\
  \ \nAlthough Aalim and I grew up in very different surroundings, we connected on\
  \ our mutual love for poetry, writing and reading and since then, we were inseperable.\n\
  We went about the city eating the local food and sweets and decided that for the\
  \ week, that I'd stay there, we'd meet everyday in the morning at 8 and I'd teach\
  \ him finer aspects of English language. \nHe didn't really go to school, but his\
  \ continuous demands to learn led his father to  ask a local priest to teach him\
  \ everyday for three hours.\nHe had an elder brother, who ran away when he was six,\
  \ in search of money and luxury.\n\"Don't you miss your brother?\" I asked him.\n\
  \"If you wait too long for the stars to shine, you don't enjoy the sunrise.\"\n\
  I was in awe of his maturity.\nI remember him calling me a flying bird because I\
  \ was following my passion and had big dreams and I wouldn't settle for anything\
  \ less. \nOn my last day in Kabul, Aalim handed me a letter, where in he told me\
  \ that I was his 'maulana' meaning teacher in Islam. And that was the most important\
  \ achievement of my entire life. His dedication reminded me that the weight of my\
  \ purpose, I carried on my shoulders, for so many years was loosening. \n\nSince\
  \ then, we kept writing each other letters.Two years ago, when I was getting married,\
  \ I sent Aalim flight tickets to come to Mumbai.He did.\n\nHe bought a special present.\
  \ \nIt was a book that was neatly wrapped in a brown paper. As I opened it, I saw\
  \ that he had collected all the letters we had exchanged over time. My face was\
  \ drenched with tears and I couldn't let go of him that day. \n\nIt read:\nTo, \n\
  My flying bird and 'maulana'.\nThis is for you.\nI had fulfilled my purpose in life,\
  \ that day. \n\nAnd today,as I sit among the crowd of wailing people, I see a flying\
  \ bird settled in a cage."
