Text: "When we decided we wouldn\u2019t get married, we figured we still deserved\
  \ a honeymoon, so we began making arrangements.\n\nWe settled on a 4-week journey\
  \ to Australia and New Zealand with a stopover in Beijing on the way down under.\n\
  \nWe thought, in our innocence, that perhaps someone at the counter would ask us\
  \ whether that was our honeymoon and bump us up to business class.\n\nAnd when the\
  \ day finally arrived, when we were standing in line at the check-in counter and\
  \ our turn finally came, there was indeed a question.\n\nNo, they did not ask us\
  \ about the trip or what it meant to us; they couldn't care less about that or the\
  \ fact that we had been saving money for this journey for the past 24 months and\
  \ making plans for the past 12.\n\nNo, what they asked instead was:\n\n - Do you\
  \ have a Chinese Visa?\n\nWhich kind of surprised us, but was met with our explanation\
  \ of how we didn't require one since we had Visas and flights to Australia less\
  \ than 72 hours after we landed and, as such, the Visa exemption applied to us.\n\
  \n - No, you need a Chinese Visa.\n\nI'll spare you the following two and a half\
  \ hours of confusion, anger, and despair, as we were repeatedly denied boarding\
  \ by someone who bragged that they had been working there for the past 12 years,\
  \ and as we desperately tried to change our flight before it departed and we got\
  \ flagged as \"no-show\".\n\nI'll spare you the humiliation of being told, several\
  \ times, that this sort of thing kept happening because people just didn't pay enough\
  \ attention to details.\n\nI'll spare you the crying and the sobbing when we realized\
  \ that our credit cards weren't able to afford the new fares, and the shouting over\
  \ the telephone when a relative called with a credit card number they could lend\
  \ us and we were finally able to change our flight with just 10 minutes to spare.\n\
  \nWe would depart three days later, and we wouldn't go to Beijing.\n\nThe next day\
  \ we went to the Chinese Embassy, where the story instilled chills and looks of\
  \ terror over their staff, who kept asking:\n\n - They did what?\n\nThe only thing\
  \ worse than the refusal to let us board was the ensuing attempt by the airline\
  \ to cover up what they had done by claiming that they had determined that our flight\
  \ had been overbooked and by offering us a standard 600\u20AC voucher for the fact\
  \ that we had been transferred to a different flight...\n\n...when we hadn't.\n\n\
  Long story short, I can assure you that the last thing I expected from our vacation\
  \ was to end it by suing the airline."
