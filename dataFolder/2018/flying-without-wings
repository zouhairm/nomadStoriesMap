Text: "\"Oh, that looks cool,\" I thought casually when my friend, Jake, showed me\
  \ a video of himself jumping off of a 10-story abandoned building attached to a\
  \ rope. It was basically a 30-meter free fall followed by an abrupt stop by the\
  \ rope, swinging back and forth until they the man in the video let you down. Then\
  \ he showed me his Kazakh friend do the same. But she didn't jump, they pushed her.\
  \ \"Looks legit, I'm down,\" I responded.\n\nWhen we arrived, there were three men\
  \ smiling and told us we needed to fill out a liability form, the \u201Cwe aren\u2019\
  t responsible if anything happens to you\u201D form. As they put the harness on\
  \ me, I looked up at the rope system they created.  At the bottom of the building,\
  \ graffiti had spelled out \u201C\u043D\u0435 \u0431\u043E\u0439\u0441\u044F,\u201D\
  \ 'don't be afraid,' in Russian. We paid them 5,000 Tenge each/15 USD. (what a steal!)\
  \ Then we followed them around the building and up a long staircase made of deteriorating\
  \ metal. As we followed one another up the steep steps, we had to warn others of\
  \ the steps that had fallen through or were on the verge of doing so. \n\nThey attached\
  \ me to the rope and told me to walk down the wooden pallet. It was really windy\
  \ and I found it difficult to walk down the narrow platform. \u201CReady?\u201D\
  \ he asked. \u201C\u0420\u0430\u0437, \u0434\u0432\u0430, \u0442\u0440\u0438!\u201D\
  \ I took some deep breaths, looking down frightened. He started yelling, \u201C\u0420\
  \u0410\u0417! \u0414\u0412\u0410\u0410! \u0422\u0420\u0418\u0418!\u201D and I took\
  \ a leap of faith. Before jumping, I accepted death. I couldn\u2019t have jumped\
  \ without doing so.  My body was in shock when the rope caught and I swang towards\
  \ the cafe next door. Never had I felt so much adrenaline.\n\nAfter slowing down,\
  \ they lowered me down to the grass.\n\n survived. And I couldn\u2019t take the\
  \ smile off my face for the rest of the week.\n\nAs a child, I was always afraid\
  \ of roller coasters, fair rides, heights, death, and spiders. But I realized that\
  \ these things would limit myself. I didn\u2019t jump just to jump, I jumped to\
  \ prove something to myself. That we should face our fears. Every time we face a\
  \ fear, we become a bit stronger, more willing to face challenges in our daily life,\
  \ and more able to overlook the little things. Overcoming fear to me meant taking\
  \ a one way trip to Siberia to work as an English teacher, it meant jumping from\
  \ an airplane, deciding to learn Russian, dunking in icy rivers during mid-winter\
  \ in Siberia, road tripping through the empty country of Kyrgyzstan, climbing those\
  \ intimidating waterfalls, and doing what you can, to get the story."
