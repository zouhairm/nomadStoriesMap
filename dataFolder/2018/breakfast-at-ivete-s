Text: "The golden rays of equatorial sunlight wouldn\u2019t let me sleep a minute\
  \ past six o\u2019clock. So as not to wake my mother and brother, I tiptoed out\
  \ of our bedroom and into the kitchen, where I was welcomed by a warm breeze wafting\
  \ in from an open window and a bowl sitting on the table, brimming with papayas,\
  \ mangoes, and other tropical fruits. A stark contrast to the freezing Canadian\
  \ winter, I was thrilled to be in Brazil with my brother and our mother on our annual\
  \ visit to my grandparents\u2019 house. Looking around the kitchen, it struck me\
  \ as odd that my grandmother was nowhere to be seen. In my seven years of life,\
  \ I had learned very quickly that Vov\xF3 Ivete always woke up with the sun. \n\
  Upon further inspection, I heard voices coming from beyond the frosted-glass doors,\
  \ one of which was swiveled open. A cheerful belly laugh sounded, which I immediately\
  \ recognized as belonging to my grandmother. A deep chuckle, which I could not identify,\
  \ responded. Listening to the conversation intertwine with the sounds of the city\
  \ waking up, I debated whether to pursue my grandmother. Eventually, my curiosity\
  \ overtook me as I padded to the entrance and peeked out onto the patio. Sitting\
  \ at the table was a man I had never seen before. He had a scruffy beard, bare feet,\
  \ and threadbare clothing which hung limply off of his frame. Intent on his plate\
  \ of food, he didn't notice the child peeking at him with interest. My grandmother,\
  \ however, saw me peering around the corner and motioned for me to join them. With\
  \ my limited Portuguese, I only had a very basic conversation with the man. I learned\
  \ that his name was Jo\xE3o and that he had a daughter about my age. \nI remained\
  \ sitting on my grandmother\u2019s knee until the last piece of papaya had been\
  \ devoured. Jo\xE3o rose to thank her with a wide smile and a string of appreciative\
  \ words. Turning to me, he fell to one knee and shook my hand, thanking me for the\
  \ company. With one last smile in our direction, Jo\xE3o opened the gate and slipped\
  \ through it, back onto the streets of Caruaru. \nAfter the resounding click of\
  \ the gate told me that my new friend was gone, I ran back into the house to wake\
  \ my mother and regale her with my story. She explained to me that this was a common\
  \ occurrence; my grandmother would often invite those who asked for food to come\
  \ in for breakfast. Delighted by this news, I vowed to wake up early every day for\
  \ the rest of our vacation to sit with my grandmother and whoever she had invited\
  \ for breakfast that day."
