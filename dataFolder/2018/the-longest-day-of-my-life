Text: "I clearly remember that day. It was one week after I met with my travel mate\
  \ in Cajamarca, Peru to start our adventure in South America.  He suggested me:\
  \ \u201CWhy do not we go there?\u201D. \u201CWhy not? Where are we going?\u201D\
  \ I said. \u201CKuelap\u201D, was his answer. \n\nKuelap, resulted to be a Pre-columbian\
  \ walled village at the North of the country, also known as the \u201CCity of the\
  \ Clouds\u201D, sited at 3000 meters above the sea level, which unique access consisted\
  \ on an ascending rustic path of 10 kms. \n\nWe started at 8,00 o\xB4clock on a\
  \ sunny morning, full of excitement and optimism. But after an hour I start feeling\
  \ my heavy weight and the lack of oxygen. Being a professional smoker did not help\
  \ at all. I felt I was slowing down my mate\xB4s trekking speed so I tried to freed\
  \ him: \u201CLook, at our own pace, ok? I\xB4ll meet you at the entrance. Do not\
  \ worry about me.\u201D For good or for bad, he did as I told. \n\nTwo hours late,\
  \ the sun was really angry and the heat was draining my body water supplies. I was\
  \ sweating like a pig on a marathon and I started having a blurry vision. I did\
  \ not want to look around, focused on my feet and counting down each step.  \n\n\
  I presumed I was about 2 kms far away from my salvation when I stopped for the very\
  \ first time to take a break. That was when I saw this 8 years old little child,\
  \ smiling me. \u201CWhat he is doing here? Should not be at the school?\u201D, I\
  \ thought. He asked me: \u201CAre you going to Kuelap? Because if so, I could give\
  \ you a ride on my donkey. It will cost you only 10 pesos.\u201D I was shocked.\
  \   A taxi-donkey, driven by a child? Are you kidding me?. \u201CNo thanks, I will\
  \ end what I started by myself\u201D. \n\n I think I stopped 30 times after that\
  \ and at least 20 of them to cover the last 500 ms. It can be quite frustrating\
  \ to feel the altitude sickness disease running freely through your body when you\
  \ are so close to your target. \n\n It took me 4 hours of continuing physical self-punishment\
  \ to reach my mate at the main door. I collapsed in the ground while blaming the\
  \ whole world for its existence. \n\nWe enjoyed Kuelap for 2 hours. On our way back\
  \ I said to my friend: \u201CWe\xB4re going to take it easy now, do not you think?\u201D\
  . He agreed. But 5 minutes after my statement, it started raining dramatically.\
  \ Suddenly it got dark and we saw a river under our feet. We looked each other and\
  \ started running those 10 kms, descending the path like native goats. \n\nThe next\
  \ thing I remember about, is myself trying to move a death body the following day,\
  \  relieved for being alive."
