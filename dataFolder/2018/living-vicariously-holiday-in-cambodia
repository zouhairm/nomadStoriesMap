Text: "Taking a six-hour bus ride into Cambodia, I found myself literally walking\
  \ across the border, visitor visa in hand, side stepping the bribery asks from the\
  \ bus company and border guards.\n\nLeaving the dodgy border crossing behind me,\
  \ I settled into Siem Reap, a tourist hub in the northwest. Filled with street markets,\
  \ flashy lights and pubs, its true draw is being the gateway to Angkor Wat, a largely\
  \ intact Khmer kingdom, and the largest religious monument in the world.\n\nI arrived\
  \ in Angkor at the ungodly hour of 5 a.m., to see the sunrise while testing my ability\
  \ to be both awe inspired and starved of sleep. \n\nWalking onto the causeway and\
  \ over the moat towards this huge intact ancient temple is like walking into a mythical\
  \ city.\n\nThe amount of intricate detail was unreal. To imagine the number of hands\
  \ at work here. Every piece of stone has ornate etching across it. One of the most\
  \ common themes were these spiritual nymphs dancing across the stone's surface.\
  \ \n\nAnother sought after site in Angkor's complex is Ta Prohm AKA Tomb Raider.\
  \ Ta Prohm remains much the same as it was found. Throughout it large prehistoric\
  \ trees have threaded their vast, exposed root systems through the ruins. It's to\
  \ the point that you couldn't remove one without the other. The site's been deemed\
  \ an UNESCO World Heritage site, and for good reason.\n\nIt was an all-day affair\
  \ seeing these countless stone structures and well worth the early hour upheaval.\
  \ \n\nWith the temples explored, I jumped on a bus to Phnom Penh. The capital is\
  \ known for being the grounds of Cambodia's dark recent past where around 25 per\
  \ cent of the population was massacred by the Khmer regime. It was a frightening\
  \ 'ethnic cleansing' that happened in the late 70s devastating the country. The\
  \ impact can still be seen today. \n\nLearning about their horrific past, I sought\
  \ out a more uplifting present-day venture. I visited the King's palace, and the\
  \ waterfront, where I jumped a cargo ship across the waterway to a small fishing\
  \ village. I also paid a visit to a fancy Casino, where I signed in as a 'hostel\
  \ guest' for a swim in their rooftop pool.\n\nWith the city's sights seen, I visited\
  \ a nearby monastery temple for a one-hour meditation session. Inside, guests settled\
  \ in on floor cushions amongst the monks. It ended as it began, with silence aside\
  \ from a tone of a bell, indicating the end of the evening, and the end of this\
  \ installment."
