Text: "\"Are you trying to get back to your roots?\" he asked. I was requesting a\
  \ month off from work to travel throughout Asia - a big ask from someone who only\
  \ grants his employees two weeks off in a year. \"Yes? Yes! Yes, I need to go back\
  \ to the Philippines and explore my roots.\" The intent was actually unclear, but\
  \ what was clear was that I had been waiting around making excuses instead of just\
  \ fulfilling my dream of traveling. After doing some math I figured that by simply\
  \ not living in New York for a month, I can stretch and mold my money to what I\
  \ want on the other side of the world. \nI was off - all by myself with nothing\
  \ but a loaned backpack and a complex itinerary including Japan, the Philippines,\
  \ Vietnam, Laos, Thailand, and Indonesia. It was a whirlwind of beautiful sights\
  \ mixed in with the rush of planes, buses, and trains. Then came the 8-hour wooden\
  \ slowboat ride from Laos into Thailand. The fact that \"slow\" was the boat's defining\
  \ characteristic worried this fast-walking New Yorker. The boat was beautifully\
  \ crafted with fine wood details and booths that overlooked the Mekong River. We\
  \ finally docked by a village on a hill. Small houses on stilts dotted the hill\
  \ and as our group approached the village children excitedly came over along with\
  \ their dogs. We learned that children, especially girls, often are unable to obtain\
  \ an education past the sixth grade as the closest school available was three hours\
  \ away and this was a luxury for most families. Still you would not see a hint of\
  \ this struggle in their eyes. \nWhen night fell the sky opened up to the most stars\
  \ I have ever seen in my life. The children rushed down from the hills and we all\
  \ formed a circle and played games. They insisted I taught them how to count in\
  \ English and they picked it up in a matter of minutes. They taught me how to count\
  \ in Lao, giggling when I made mistakes but comforting me that I would soon learn.\
  \ In that small town far away from all the lights and the famous sights, and in\
  \ those children's eyes were the brightest stars I have ever seen."
