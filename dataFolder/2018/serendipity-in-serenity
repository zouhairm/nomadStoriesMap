Text: "And how could i ever experience what life meant without diving into The Indian\
  \ Ocean? I hadn't learnt swimming and as clich\xE9 as it may sound I feared water\
  \ more than i loved it. The ocean doesn't welcome everybody warmly. It smells new\
  \ members, not just to everybody. But under that magnificent formidable accoutre\
  \ l encountered moisture that wrapped my skin up to a degree where I fail miserably\
  \ to even exaggerate about it. Every centimetre down the ocean blocked the passage\
  \ to my worries, started pondering the value of every single breath. Thoughts got\
  \ marinated with negativity, adrenaline and fear. What if the sharks grind me into\
  \ their jaws, what if I get wolfed down by a whale, what if an octopus embraces\
  \ me happily and never leaves me, what if and what not swirled the throne of my\
  \ thoughts. I always learnt that we cannot seek advice from them who have never\
  \ stepped ahead of only excitement. Cannot ask a shepherd how to kill a wolf who\
  \ has never encountered a wolf. So my mind was of no good help for an advice. I\
  \ heartily enjoined deafening myself from negative opinions my heart gave and admitted\
  \ myself into the fine boulevard of the exalted ocean. The moment I dove my heart\
  \ didn't want anything accept coming back alive but that intuition of mine got completely\
  \ altered when I started to see things and discovering the ultra inexplicable lifestyle\
  \ of the oceanic creatures. Eye contacted with one of the most wreaking havoc creatures,\
  \ though it looked like nobody was pleased to see me in their town I swear I was\
  \ nothing more than a nobody. The deeper I went the more I see the more of extraordinarily\
  \ peculiar organisms but absolutely exquisite, may be from the ocean's perspective\
  \ profusely luxurious. After a not so short while I saw something so big from a\
  \ distance that I literally started hesitating and panicking and why would I not\
  \ because that creature had a head thrice the size of the biggest parrots cage,\
  \ attached with seemingly terrorizing swiftly moving arms and without a doubt it\
  \ was the great octopus. I was then and there consoled and stopped to panic and\
  \ told the ocean doesn't likes it when it smells fear. Over all it was a breathtaking\
  \ experience though I was a non heritage visitor I never knew I'd be treated with\
  \ such reverence by the ocean. Tried my best to give ocean another name but I came\
  \ to naught concluding the already predominant name doesn't need any other description.\
  \ Soundly stupid it is to say you can overcome fears without facing them."
