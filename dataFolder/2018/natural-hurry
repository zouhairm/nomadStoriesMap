Text: "First event worthy of notification: I\u2019m completely lost. The map clearly\
  \ said that I had to turn left and walk three avenues if I wanted to get to the\
  \ exact spot where the 5th Avenue meets the 103rd Street. Right next to the Central\
  \ Park. Easy, that\u2019s all I had to find: the Central Park. How hard could it\
  \ be to catch sight of a huge green rectangle of nature in the middle of the gigantic\
  \ buildings of the busiest city my humble European soul has ever set foot on? Piece\
  \ of cake! At least that\u2019s what I thought, when I saw it from the Top of the\
  \ Rock\u2026 Ah this thing about perspectives, too bad I wasn\u2019t there at the\
  \ moment. Also too bad I had left my sense of orientation in my mother\u2019s womb.\n\
  The truth is that I\u2019m in a rush. I waited the whole week for today because\
  \ it\u2019s snowing and I wanted to experience the vision of a white Central Park.\
  \ I wanted to spend some quality time letting myself do nothing else, but feeling\
  \ the Central Park on a snowy day. Is it so difficult to read a map? You\u2019ll\
  \ either turn left or right. You should probably just risk it.  No, this is not\
  \ working, I think I\u2019ll have to change the tactic. Let\u2019s try something\
  \ more motivational: I believe in you. You do know the way. Or do you really do?\
  \ \n\u2018Do you know how to get to the Central Park?\u2019  Why is there a shadow\
  \ covering my little sample of the sun? Oh wait, there's a woman staring at me with\
  \ an inquisitive expression. I think she\u2019s lost just like me. I could swear\
  \ her voice sounded just like the one inside my head. Maybe that\u2019s something\
  \ foreigners have in common. She\u2019s surely one.\n\u201CSorry, did you say Central\
  \ Park?\u201D I replied. \u201CI\u2019m not sure. But funny, that\u2019s exactly\
  \ what I was trying to figure out. I\u2019ll go that way if you want to follow.\u201D\
  \ And she just did. No questions, as if I was meant to bump into this woman in this\
  \ determined instant in time. So next thing we\u2019re going to the Lexington Avenue\
  \ and immediately turning back \u2013 we hadn\u2019t chosen the right way. And I\
  \ had just crossed paths with a particular stranger. I never heard about my Belgian\
  \ connection in New York besides that day. But she\u2019s not a complete stranger\
  \ anymore: she\u2019s my particular stranger.\u201D\nMore than any other place in\
  \ the world, there\u2019s only one city where you can feel like you\u2019re a part\
  \ of the mosaic and that is New York. Whether you were born here or you\u2019re\
  \ an immigrant or you\u2019re a tourist or you\u2019re just human, New York will\
  \ let you become a part of its natural urban rhythm. And, god, are we not in a hurry?"
