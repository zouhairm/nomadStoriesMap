Text: "The psyche bridges the effable with the ineffable. Most of the time, consciousness\
  \ turns to the material world for truth, but the immaterial realm also offers truth,\
  \ a truth we empirically deny exists.\n\nThat\u2019s what I told the girl, anyway.\n\
  \nWe were at a bar in Lakewood, OH, and, after a few beers, I blabbered these arcane\
  \ things about things one shouldn\u2019t say a thing about.\n\nThis young woman,\
  \ who did me the kindness of listening to my babble, gave off the impression she\
  \ had sprung fully-formed from the earth. In her corset she made the impression\
  \ of a Hohle Fels woman or someone directly born of the Rhine.\n\nWith half-focused\
  \ eyes, she nodded, and hesitated, and paused, and reconsidered, and finally said,\
  \ \u201CBut?\u201D\n\nJust one word.\n\nBut.\n\nWith a question mark.\n\nThe word,\
  \ glistening lodestar that it was, lingered there between us, pointing out just\
  \ exactly what I had not said with my arcane blathering, and, most importantly,\
  \ she made me doubt what I\u2019d just arcanely blathered.\n\nI sat there pondering\
  \ the word, her word, that single word, while she looked at me with sadness that\
  \ verged on pity.\n\n\u201CYou\u2019re so far in the clouds,\u201D she said, \u201C\
  you\u2019re yearning for something tangible and tactile. It\u2019s rare, mostly\
  \ it goes the other way around, but I\u2019ve seen it before.\u201D\n\n\u201CSeen\
  \ what?\u201D\n\n\u201CMen like you. Come with me.\u201D\n\nShe dragged me outside.\
  \ It was evening by then and cool and dark out. She stopped at a black Hyundai and\
  \ had this weird look on her face.\n\n\u201CThe real problem is self-acceptance,\u201D\
  \ she said.\n\n\u201CIs that all?\u201D I laughed.\n\n\u201CWhat else could it be?\u201D\
  \n\nI shrugged. I didn\u2019t have a clue.\n\n\u201CInstead of making everything\
  \ so big, just enjoy things for what they are. If you do that, the big picture comes\
  \ together on its own. That\u2019s an ineffable truth, to put it your way,\u201D\
  \ she said, \u201Cand now I\u2019m going to show you.\u201D\n\nShe smiled deeply,\
  \ even wryly, as a breeze brought her scent to me, a scent touched slightly by beer,\
  \ and stirred by lip balm, and, somehow, of the earth.\n\nThen, with a little smile,\
  \ the breeze softened, and she pulled back.\n\nIt was over.\n\nShe went off in the\
  \ black Hyundai, and left me in the cool air of a parking lot of a bar in Lakewood,\
  \ OH.\n\nFor a moment I asked myself what the hell had just happened. Of course,\
  \ I didn\u2019t know, and it was awkward at first, so awkward, but I inhaled deeply,\
  \ anyway, until I was full. The cool air felt good in my lungs, and the evening\
  \ felt good, and so I walked, just plainly walked, into the night."
