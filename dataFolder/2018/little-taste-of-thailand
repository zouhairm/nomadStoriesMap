Text: "Dear friend, you could ask why Thailand. Had that once in a lifetime opportunity\
  \ to go there with a friend of mine, who open my eyes for traveling!\nHe open my\
  \ eyes, how to see things in another perspective to be able to appreciate a different\
  \ culture.\nFirst i never travel that long on plane in my life, was 15 hours non\
  \ stop. Long flight. \nWhen got to the airport and the doors open to the street,\
  \ i took a big breath and couldnt breath. It was 35 degrees, ok, i came from minus\
  \ 2. So just a little big difference. I  think i needed like 3-4 days i got used\
  \ to the heat and humidity in the air.\n\nDo you know Thailand is a kingdom?\nWell\
  \ when i was there in last Januray in 2017, at that time the Thai king dided King\
  \ Bhumibol Adulyadej.\nHis paints and pictures were hanged everywhere and i seen\
  \ lots of people walking in fully black clothes.\nIts a remarkable place to travel\
  \ to, i wasnt that interested to go to the islands, ok of course part of me would\
  \ go and check how is that famous full moon party in Koh Pangan. \nBut i wanted\
  \ to see Thailand, the temples, the local people, all those weird food stands on\
  \ the side of the road.\nTo travel across up to north of Thailand by night train\
  \ with locals.. \nWas amazing. The different smells, the way people look, live their\
  \ lives.\nRemember the time when was traveling in Bangkok all day in all the public\
  \ transports. \nBoat, which just cross Csaophraja river one side to the other. There\
  \ are speed boats, goes along the river sides.\nOr the one which goes in the small\
  \ tunnels and you can see people houses, how they live their life, so for a breath\
  \ of time you became part of it.\nThe older woman washing clothes in the dirty water,\
  \ boys jumping to the water from the bridge. \nI love the little car/motor bike/\
  \ taxi, its called tuk-tuk. The drivers are insane in the traffic, going between\
  \ buses, cross the red light.. Ahh and not the comfiest things so be aware you will\
  \ get some bruises, specially if you clumsy as me. :)\nRemember the night when was\
  \ wondering around in the city and we appear in China Town!! In Thailand a small\
  \ China! It was the time of the Chinese new year festival. Food market, but dont\
  \ think about it like few stands, No massive, hundreds of them, on the side of the\
  \ main road, or blocking the small streets. I was so happy and excited, was jumping\
  \ up and down like a kid, and claping my hands together, and screaming loud to my\
  \ friend\"! I am in China Town, In Bangkok! Im in Thialnad!!"
