Text: "Getting back to 2017, it was a gloomy February day. That evening i was talking\
  \ walk on the terrace and at that time my mind behaved like an ideal ball (the ball\
  \ which won't stop on collision).The dry Feb wind for the first time, knocked and\
  \ kept the feels of change in front of my soul's door.Following day was the first\
  \ day of my 12th exam.Exam continued for 22 days. The vacation succeeding the exam\
  \ was going to be unlike the other vacation i had spent.During high school,my exhilaration\
  \ for vacation would be unbridled.I used to complete at least a chapter from each\
  \ subject. But the vacation after 12th exam insisted me to discover an another dimension\
  \ of myself.I realized that my exposure of the world was half a unit on the scale\
  \ of ten units.Till date,I have breathe the air of only two places.The first of\
  \ the city called, Sujangarh, my birthplace & the second of the city called,Guwahati,\
  \ where i was brought up.These vacation was the one which swept the dust of my yearnings.I\
  \ realized that i yearn to explore never seen places, live.I remember,during my\
  \ childhood,the immature days,I was sure that  by mid-teenage i would have  kept\
  \ foot on every state of India.I would have tried skiing,my eyes would have taken\
  \ the pleasure of gorgeous hill curves.I would have played snow fight in Kullu Manali\
  \ .With respect to time, i realized that my defined age period had passed.I have\
  \ been constantly deceiving my heart's present calling.I got enlightened that I\
  \ want to travel to a distant land.This idea became a second skin to me.I perceived\
  \ that I was holding myself to feel  what i craves presently.Self realization is\
  \ that garden which nurtures the garden of life.It aids to eradicate the weed from\
  \ the garden of life and plant seasonal flowers.\n                    I want to\
  \ pursue engineering.In order to take admission in good engineering college,I have\
  \ to appear an exam and score decent. I appeared for this exam in 2017 but didn't\
  \ score good.In order to score decent, one need to study accordingly what is asked.Therefore,my\
  \ parents advised me to take coaching for the next appearance.I coincided to them\
  \ with a hope that next time i will score decent and would settle in any hostel,as\
  \ all i wanted was to hightail from house by hook method or by cook method.After\
  \ enrolling into coaching, my grades degraded exponentially.\n                 \
  \    Before, this enrollment I asked my parents to visit any hill station but my\
  \ mother didn't agree.But I expected that I would be understood."
