Text: "Thailand is known as the Land of Smiles, & it gave me a lifetime of them. When\
  \ I arrived in Thailand, my husband & I spent a few days in Bangkok. I wanted to\
  \ visit a Buddhist temple, so we took a short boat ride to Wat Arun. When we arrived,\
  \ it started to rain. We ran into the ordination hall to stay dry, and inside, we\
  \ saw one of the Monks that lived there. He motioned for us to sit by him to participate\
  \ in a traditional Thai blessing. He placed a white string called sai sin on our\
  \ wrists. It\u2019s thought to provide protection to the person wearing it. Our\
  \ next stop led us to the village of Baan Tuek, about an hour from Sukhothai. I\
  \ wanted to visit Thailand to see elephants, & I knew I wanted to interact with\
  \ them responsibly. A lot of research & several emails later, I had secured my spot\
  \ at Boon Lott's Elephant Sanctuary. It\u2019s 600 hundred acres of forested land\
  \ that encourages the elephants to interact in a natural environment. Upon meeting\
  \ Katherine, the founder of the sanctuary, I knew the week would inspire new purpose\
  \ in my life. Hearing her story & learning about how the elephants ended up there\
  \ was heartbreaking. She also took in 25 dogs & helped establish the first vet clinic\
  \ in the village. Mornings were spent walking with the elephants in the forest.\
  \ The BLES dogs were our guides, & they showed us the best spots to cool off. My\
  \ favorite was the treehouse, because it\u2019s where we went deeper into how each\
  \ animal ended up at BLES. It took me a week to be able to look at my photos without\
  \ crying. Jack's story was the hardest to process. Jack showed up at BLES after\
  \ her owner tried to cut one of her legs off. The leg couldn't be saved, but Jack\
  \ didn't seem to notice, because the smile never left her face. Daily trips led\
  \ us to banana tree fields, where we got a crash course in machetes from Katherine\u2019\
  s seven year old. The trees provide extra nourishment to the elephants, so we chopped\
  \ down as many as we could fit in the truck. When Katherine found out it was my\
  \ birthday, she & the mahouts threw me a surprise birthday party. The mahouts taught\
  \ us Thai phrases & insisted on one too many shots of whiskey. Although we didn\u2019\
  t speak the same language, we felt connected. We found a way to share stories, laughs,\
  \ & a few tears. I felt more at home in this moment than I have in the city I\u2019\
  ve lived in for a decade. Until then, I didn\u2019t understand that it's not where\
  \ you are, but the people you surround yourself with, that make you feel at home."
