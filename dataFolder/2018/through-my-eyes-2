Text: "After arriving at a local staple in the small town of Dumbarton Scotland we\
  \ relaxed.  The lack of air conditioning in contrast to the old but comfortable\
  \ atmosphere of The rundown hotel room really had me thinking if a 25 day holiday\
  \ around Europe with 4 kids, my husband and I and our niece/nanny was a good idea.\
  \  Pulling me out of my hump my husband suggested to get dressed to visit the pub\
  \ attached to the hotel for some food and ale.  I literally was terrified because\
  \ we stood out like a sore thumb. We decided to grab something from the tap and\
  \ grab a seat outside so I could indulge on my first cigarette in over 10 hours.\n\
  That was the best idea ever.  What started out as a simple question to the older\
  \ gentlemen in the table beside ours turned out to be a five hour conversation of\
  \ a lifetime.  As early afternoon turned into evening more and more locals showed\
  \ up and pulled up a chair to join in on the conversation.  The hospitality by every\
  \ single patron of the pub towards us was truly refreshing.  An older couple Anne\
  \ and Rick, retired account and mathematics teacher had so many questions about\
  \ what America is like and filling us in on how they raised their children.  The\
  \ original local Liev that started this whole gathering of new friends and calling\
  \ his friends to come down to the pub was a very outgoing Scotsman.  He drove boats\
  \ in the spring out at the channel and was telling us how he would have a boat party\
  \ everytime the weather was permitting, he joked about politics and his disgust\
  \ of Trump from his perspective.                                  Rolfie was a slender\
  \ man maybe five foot three with a beard to his chest.  He smoked rolled cigars\
  \ and was very quiet but, when he did join in on the conversation I got lost in\
  \ his deep Glasgow accent.  He told us of all the places from Glasgow to Ullapool\
  \ that he had biked and about this Spanish lover he meet in the early 90\u2019s\
  \ \u201Cwith skin sun kissed by the Spanish sun.\u201D  I felt for the first time\
  \ a deeper connection to the world,  Conversation was so great I didn\u2019t realize\
  \ the sixth cidar I had slurped down until I got up to use the bathroom.  With every\
  \ new person that joined us around that table outside that pub connected to our\
  \ hotel I realized that traveling isn\u2019t so much about the things you see although\
  \ they are just breathtaking but, it\u2019s about the people that you meet is what\
  \ is most important. For the rest of our time there human interaction was the essence\
  \ of the journey.   I will never forget. X"
