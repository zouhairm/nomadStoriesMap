Text: "Very easy to establish relationships with the local community when it has 15people.\
  \ In the eco-village Suderbyn on the Gotland island in Sweden there is this number\
  \ of people.\nFerry arrived at midnight. Two guys were waiting for me with the sign\"\
  Welcome, Oksana!\". I huged my friend Sergey, whom I have not seen for 1.5years.\
  \ He introduced me to Kamuran, an EVSvolunteer from Turkey.\n-Why do you have a\
  \ hat and a shirt on the inside?-I asked Sergey.\n-I found them and I like them,\
  \ but there are emblems of companies and I don\u2019t like that.\n2years ago he\
  \ used to live in Ukraine in Chernihiv region. Worked in a field of nuclear power.\
  \ When he decided to change his life, he became to be a volunteer in an eco-village.\
  \ A year later he decided to stay here. Sergey has happy eyes, beautiful smile,\
  \ gray hair and very simple attitude to life.\nSuderbyn appeared 10years ago. Its\
  \ inhabitants are citizens of different countries. In this place people learn about\
  \  permaculture, they understand what hydroponics is, teach guests to use a dry\
  \ toilet, cook vegan food and live in love with nature. Not far from the village\
  \ there is a military base. Last autumn, when the Americans were training there,\
  \ the wiev of cargo helicopters brought an anxiety. That is why these people bring\
  \ the slogan \"No more war!\" to the world - the first such festival was here last\
  \ summer.\nNext 6days were challenging. I learned how to hug people, accept their\
  \ kindness; I learned to sort rubbish according to their rules, because even different\
  \ types of paper should be folded into different boxes; I learned to brush teeth\
  \ with a non-froth paste that does not make the water unfit for use; I tasted vegan\
  \ yogurts and cheese.\n \"You can\u2019t be angry or sad when you live near the\
  \ sea in beautiful nature,\"- I thought, walking along the rocks hanging over the\
  \ glade of the Baltic Sea. One night we rode bikes in the forest  to Sweden's \"\
  highest hill\" to see the \"biggest\"moon. That night I learned how to ride in the\
  \ dark through the puddles, which sizes were as a small lakes.\nCooking was really\
  \ useful in making connection with people. For last dinner Sergey and me prepared\
  \ Ukrainian food, sang Ukrainian folk songs. How  happy I was  when I heard a Frenchman\
  \ tuned up the tunes of our songs even after dinner!\nWay back began at 6:30am.\
  \ Kamuran took me to the port. I kissed him on the cheek and promised to come back\
  \ in the summer to learn how to work in their garden, and to give back the book\
  \ which I borrowed in their library."
