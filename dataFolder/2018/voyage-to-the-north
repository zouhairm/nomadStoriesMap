Text: "Nigeria as a country is blessed with tribal and religous diversities. Being\
  \ born in the southern part of the country which is known for its forests and swamps,\
  \ I was going on a tourist rip to the Northern part of the country which was known\
  \ for its vast expanse of grasslands. I always heard a lot of stories about the\
  \ North. I were told of how backward they were in terms of academics and culture.\
  \ I was also told that they were very serious moslems, who were ready to kill anyone\
  \ from the south who crossed their path. The press also helped boost the tales of\
  \ how the northerners wilingly attacked and killed southerners at will but I was\
  \ determined to take this trip to the north, afterall traveling was meant to include\
  \ adventure, risk and fun.\nRight from the bus park at Enugu, I and my companions\
  \ already started having goosebumps on the trip. We were christians so all we had\
  \ to do was to commit the trip to God and go find out more about the Northern part\
  \ of our country which was really torn on a northern-southern parallel of culture\
  \ and religion. \nThe voyage was far better than we expected. The people in the\
  \ bus were mostly Hausas, the same people we dreaded due to the tales we heard in\
  \ the south. Looking over the vast land used for farming in Benue (2 hours from\
  \ the park in Enugu), one would be forced to believe that the North was not just\
  \ politically in control but also in charge of the food production.\nThe bus came\
  \ to a halt at markudi and we saw over small children rushing towards the bus. these\
  \ children though barely naked were looking pretty and all had a big piece of roasted\
  \ yam in their hands. They were young Tiv hawkers who were desperate to make a living.\
  \ This was very surprising, we in the South were always told that the Northerners\
  \ were very lazy people who were only interested in enforcing sharia law all over\
  \ the country. The children rushed down to the bus and sampled their wares all screaming\
  \ \"Buy your yam!! 100 Naira per piece\" I was surprised, this children could even\
  \ speak good english. I threw 200 to one of the lucky kids and surprising he said\
  \ back to me \"thank you. God bless you.\" the last thing I ever expected was to\
  \ see educated people. I had always believed they were the most barbaric of tribes.\n\
  The voyage is one of the my best trips. The food was delicious, unique and cheap.\
  \ the prices of goods were unusually cheaper than those in the south. By the time\
  \ we left, we learnt one lesson which is \"There are always two sides to a Coin\""
