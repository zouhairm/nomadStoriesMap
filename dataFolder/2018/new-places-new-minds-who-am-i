Text: "I was always excited to meet new people, new cultures.\n\nI had never the opportunity\
  \ to travel to another country before. And although my life is good, it always had\
  \ go in a straight line and I wanted to make a changes, I wanted to take a risk,\
  \ jump into the void and know if I was able to float or sink in this boat called\
  \ life. \n\nI made the decision to travel to Buenos Aires, and since I arrived I\
  \ felt run its breeze by my body. I had gone as a tourist, crazy and risky, but\
  \ in the end I fell in love and stayed there for almost a year. One of the best\
  \ pleasure was can enduring hunger for two days, walking barefoot and smiling at\
  \ the wine. \nThe best thing was to find in the people the gratitude of inner happiness.\
  \ I also had the opportunity to expire the smells of Peru, the rocky sounds of the\
  \ Ecuatorian Andes, the deep and immaculate sounds from Uruguay, but the best thing\
  \ was to be in the unmistakable southern plain of our continent, the Argentina.\n\
  \n\u201CWhat headache I feel today. I forgot take my glass of milk, and Tala and\
  \ Negra. \xBFWhere are the cats? They're running on the roof sunbathing, that was\
  \ what said the message that mom sent me. I walk with this t-shirt, shorts and a\
  \ pair of broken shoes up the street, reaching Centenario park, and I'm still looking\
  \ for the answer to such a frantic question Who am I? In this life I don't know,\
  \ but I'm sure that in my previous one I was a supreme a King, evil maybe, of sovereign\
  \ tyranny, irritating and manipulative, like those of time of the thousand demons.\
  \ But today, I'm like a simple chess pawn, which is moved from one place to another\
  \ to save the King. How changes things when you change of life, right?\n\nI'm not\
  \ a writer, nor a reader. I have never been able to with such (tales), neither with\
  \ stories nor with Pascals. The days go by and everything changes, from the way\
  \ it dawns, to the way the night shows its noses; everything is so new to me. I\
  \ have already begun to take love to this game, in which I must move without falling\
  \ to the cliff, much less lose my sanity.\n\nToday I'm around here again, trying\
  \ to write. Searching and searching my treasures, I haven't found the answer and\
  \ I am afraid to continue walking along the same path without finding a way out.\
  \ If the moon isn't present when I fainted, the sun will shine for me. I'm still\
  \ not sure how to fly, where to land, I'm looking for the Alem. Pieces watered by,\
  \ without being able to put together this puzzle, I forgot that I am blind. I throw\
  \ out my mind to the garden\u201D."
