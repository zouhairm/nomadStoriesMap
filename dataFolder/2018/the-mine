Text: "Potash deposits in Ukraine, Stebnyk settled, crystallized, and waited eternity\
  \ before discovered in 1873. After 139 years more a rude yet sentimental miner extracted\
  \ a small piece of the solid and handed it to me. Now I\u2019m looking at the time\
  \ child recalling my trip to a potash mine with a cinema crew shooting a movie called\
  \ \u201CThe Lost City\u201D.\nIt was a time for me to see sites of Ukraine untouched\
  \ by the sunlight, in all possible meanings.\nIt\u2019s hard to believe that someone\
  \ can be brave enough to be taken 200 m under the ground by a rusty miner\u2019\
  s cage, hoping that these caves won\u2019t fall on their heads. A usual miner\u2019\
  s shift lasts 4 hours; extra time is unhealthy. We were there to make art and the\
  \ art needed 6 hours. I should have started with: I am claustrophobic. When going\
  \ down to obscurity do not picture anything. Just put the helmet on your head, affix\
  \ the lantern to your helmet and hang the heavy battery on your belt and do what\
  \ you must.\nGood news: a risk of methane explosion is really low since the deposits\
  \ don\u2019t contain organic matter.\nSo I\u2019m standing in the cage, I have my\
  \ lantern turned on and I\u2019m asked not to get nervous. The 200 m descend lasts\
  \ 2 minutes. A square of light above us is becoming smaller. I can watch a geological\
  \ cut changing colors and texture. Distracting. I see emergency ladder. Soothing.\
  \ Somebody is making jokes, they are not getting to the addressee. The light is\
  \ far away up and we need to deal with a dungeon. Low ceilings, the helmet is touching\
  \ the solids, lighting covers white crystals with yellow film. Subconscious is tending\
  \ to extend the walls and win some space. A good miner is trying to comfort me with\
  \ stories. These men are always smiling, tipsy and eager to talk. One of their beliefs\
  \ says that every mine-worker must have his own rat, for one day it might save his\
  \ life. The animal senses any earth vibrations, even from afar and runs. \nAfter\
  \ a few hours we are starting to yawn, make stupid jokes and get irritated. A lack\
  \ of oxygen. Having finished a shift a miner turned the air supply turbines off\
  \ and went home. We need 1 more hour to shoot a scene of a quarrel; the actors are\
  \ just playing perfectly!\nWhat a joy to get back on the surface. I\u2019m turning\
  \ around my axis, and I see nothing but ruins, rust and an old shabby wheel that\
  \ keeps on bringing tired tipsy people down and up the mine. Pressure still hurts\
  \ my eyes. I\u2019ll never come back here, but it\u2019s not the case for the mine-workers"
