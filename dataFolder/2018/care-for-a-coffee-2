Text: "\u201CSo where in the United States are you from?\u201D he asked me, pouring\
  \ coffee into a white porcelain cup. Don Carlos was an enigma--his sombrero, mud-splattered\
  \ jeans and knee-length rubber boots said campesino, or rural farmer, but the artfully\
  \ placed coffee sacks around his shop, the spotless Chemex in his hand, and the\
  \ single-origin coffee he was pouring said third-wave coffee barista.\n\nA town\
  \ near San Francisco, I told him. \u201CIs it called Daly City?\u201D I was shocked--how\
  \ did he know what Daly City was? After all, it wasn\u2019t exactly on the San Francisco\
  \ tourist circuit, and we were in a small town in Colombia's coffee region, far\
  \ from the bustling traffic of the Bay Area. I asked him if he had ever been. \u201C\
  No, but my brother has lived there for the past 18 years.\u201D\n\nColombia wasn't\
  \ as safe back then--the guerilla had an active presence in the region--and his\
  \ brother, just 17 years-old at the time, decided that life there wasn\u2019t for\
  \ him and left for the US. His brother got a job working as a driver in California,\
  \ and Don Carlos worked as a repairman through Colombia's various political changes.\
  \ After saving enough money, he bought a small plot of land and starting planting\
  \ coffee. At first he sold the dried, raw beans to a co-op that later toasted(i.e.\
  \ burned) and exported the beans to the US, but he later realized he could make\
  \ better-tasting coffee, and better profits, by producing the coffee himself. After\
  \ a couple of years, he opened Cafe La Floresta, where he now serves coffee that\
  \ is grown, picked, dried, toasted and brewed by himself and a small team of workers.\
  \ He employs mostly women--widows and uneducated young mothers--and pays them better\
  \ than they could get at another farm.\n\nI asked him, quite hopefully, if he would\
  \ ever consider expanding his business or selling his coffee outside of Colombia.\
  \ Unnervingly sweet and fruity, it was unlike any other coffee I had tried. I didn't\
  \ want this to be my last taste.\n\n\"I don't want to,\" he said with a sly smile.\
  \ \"I want my brother to come visit me.\"\n\nWhen I got back home to San Francisco,\
  \ my backpack was a 2 pounds heavier than it had been when I left. Sergio, Don Carlos'\
  \ brother, came to meet me at my house. He was younger, but had the determined eyes,\
  \ the same smile. When I handed him the coffee, he pressed the bag against his nose\
  \ and took a whiff. \"Ah,\" he sighed with a smile on his face. \"It smells like\
  \ home.\""
