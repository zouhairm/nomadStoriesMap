Text: "When I first arrived in Peru for my university year abroad, I was overwhelmed.\
  \ Growing up in a tiny Austrian village, Lima felt loud and dirty, the unknown smells\
  \ of markets were around every corner and everything was so colorful! As an exchange\
  \ student my first new friends were other internationals. They were in the same\
  \ boat as me. They were the ones who knew what I felt like when spending important\
  \ holidays away from my family \u2013 so I spent Thanksgiving with Katie and Amy\
  \ from the US and they spent Easter with me. Linda also from Austria were the ones\
  \ who were daydreaming about Schnitzel with me when I desperately wanted something\
  \ familiar and Hadrien from France was the one who shared the joy of \u201Cpooping\
  \ normally\u201D.\nHowever, as time passed and I grew more accustomed to Peruvian\
  \ culture, I realized there was something missing. While I was having a great time,\
  \ I kept feeling like I was missing out on something. I couldn\u2019t really put\
  \ my finger on it at first and it felt like an itch I couldn\u2019t scratch.\nThen,\
  \ four months in, my laptop broke. Studying in a foreign country where I didn\u2019\
  t really speak the language, my first reaction was slight panic. I needed to write\
  \ papers! Study! Skype with my family! Help! To my rescue came my buddy that the\
  \ local university had assigned to me who recommended a friend to fix my laptop.\
  \ The night I met that friend, my whole exchange turned around. We hit it off, bonding\
  \ over a mutual love for different cultures and stupid jokes no one but us thought\
  \ were funny, that overnight we became best friends. While he never did manage to\
  \ fix my laptop, he gave me so much more than that. He went ahead and took me to\
  \ soccer games with his friends, invited me to Sunday dinners and BBQs, took me\
  \ on trips with his family and to his favorite restaurants. His family taught me\
  \ about local foods and had me practicing my Spanish (which didn\u2019t always go\
  \ well \u2013 I have yet to forget the time I mistakenly told his grandma I was\
  \ exitada (aroused) rather than emocionada (excited) to meet her, or the time I\
  \ told  his mom I needed something to cagar (poop) instead of cargar (charge) my\
  \ phone). \nThrough him and his family, I experienced a connection with Peru and\
  \ its culture that I never expected. The acceptance, inclusion and generosity his\
  \ family showed me truly gave me a home 10000km away from home. To me, there is\
  \ no saying that holds more truth than \u201CYou will never be completely at home\
  \ again, because part of your heart always will be elsewhere.\u201D"
