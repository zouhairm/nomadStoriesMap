Text: "It\u2019s all well and good giving advice on various bits and pieces, but sometimes\
  \ what you really need is a first person account of an experience to bring something\
  \ to life. Travel stories give a certain realism to the dream of travelling and\
  \ are full of inspirational lessons.\n\nWe have loads of articles which offer just\
  \ that in this section, so have a browse through and see through the eyes of people\
  \ who have been they wouzfortunate enough to experience these amazing things and\
  \ report back.\n\nPerhaps you\u2019ve already been there and done it, and fancy\
  \ having a go at story-telling? In which case, get in touch with us and pitch an\
  \ idea for an article; we love reading about  the same time I was also terrified\
  \ of leaving the comforts of my small town. But something in me knew that if I didn\u2019\
  t get out and explore I would always regret. So when I started university I made\
  \ a promise to myself, I would make a trip abroad happen before I graduated.\n\n\
  I remember talking with those around me about my dreams for travel. Many of them\
  \ agreed that traveling sounded amazing, yet not one said anything along the lines\
  \ of let\u2019s make a trip happen. As much as I wanted to go out and travel I was\
  \ scared to make the leap on my own, and so I just went along constantly looking\
  \ up travel deals and just hoping that one day I would get to make my dreams of\
  \ travel come true.Once I had my mind set on doing a semester abroad the next challenge\
  \ was finding a program to apply for.\n\nMy BSc is in business, and my business\
  \ school, it was very strict on the study abroad programs it would accept. For the\
  \ 1,500 business students there was about 5 spots avaibale in study abroad programs\
  \ that would be accepted by our business school.\n\nI didn\u2019t let this stop\
  \ me though and applied anyways with my fingers crossed I would get inThe day I\
  \ left for Australia will be one I will never forget. I so clearly remember sitting\
  \ at the airport waiting for my flight, and having the reality of what I was about\
  \ to do fully hit me.\n\nI was terrified.\n\nI mean I didn\u2019t really need to\
  \ travel just yet did I? What was so bad about staying in my hometown with all my\
  \ friends and family around me?\n\nI will never forget the tearful phone call I\
  \ made to my mom asking her to come back and pick me up, I didn\u2019t want to go\
  \ to Australia anymore. Her reply, \u201Ctravel safe, call me when you get there,\
  \ I love you.\u201D\n\nThis is tough love at its best and I will always be thankful\
  \ for thisI missed my family, my friends and being in my comfort zone."
