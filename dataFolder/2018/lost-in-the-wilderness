Text: "Spain-a marvellous country-is a wild and enticing mixture of history, landscapes\
  \ and adventure. Last year, I went to Spain for a month all on my own; this was\
  \ my first ever international trip. I had this irrational fear of something going\
  \ wrong yet that didn't stop me from going there. Everything turned out pretty well\
  \ by the end of the trip though. I was staying in Bilbao, doing a Spanish language\
  \ course.\nOn one fine Sunday, I decided to visit the Oma Forest. A work of art\
  \ by famous artist Agustin Ibarrola, Oma Forest is a painted forest in the Basque\
  \ Country of Spain. Though I'd heard a lot of about this place, I didn't have much\
  \ idea about how to go there. All I could do was rely on Google Maps. I risked everything\
  \ and trusted completely the Maps and began a journey that I'd never forget. \n\
  In the beginning, everything seemed simple but things took a turn for the worse\
  \ when I alighted the bus and couldn't see anything related to the forest. I asked\
  \ a few people about this august, unseen place and began the long walk that lasted\
  \ for hours; by now I hardly had any internet connectivity in my cell which made\
  \ it impossible for me to use the Maps. So, all I had was the strong yet mostly\
  \ wrong gut feeling. I didn't give up instead I kept walking until my legs hurt\
  \ in the search of this secret forest. I could see cars passing by but not a single\
  \ person walking on the side of the roads. After walking through the wilderness,\
  \ scared by the silence, I reached a sole cafe that stuck out like a sore thumb.\
  \ Although there were so many people around me, I'd never felt so lonely. After\
  \ having a glass of Mosto and a sandwich, I began walking towards the Oma Forest.\
  \ I had to walk for almost an hour to see the first painted tree. When I found myself\
  \ surrounded by these skilfully painted trees, I felt as if I had reached the summit\
  \ of Mount Everest (I don't actually know how it feels to reach the peak of Everest).\
  \ Each tree there had a story to tell and one has to see from a specific location\
  \ to comprehend the painting on the trees as they all converged to make stunning\
  \ paintings. I was already in love with this place.\nOn my way back, I didn't have\
  \ the fear of the unknown anymore. But when I reached the bus stop, I could neither\
  \ see a bus nor a person. So, I was on the verge of a break down. So, when the bus\
  \ finally arrived, a wave of relief washed over me. The trip back home was full\
  \ of memories and adrenaline. This decision of mine had pushed me to the edge."
