Text: "You know, a really interesting essay should have a good start. Is my writing\
  \ interesting? Well, I don`t think so, I'm just trying to explain some things.\n\
  \nTo begin with, it would be nice to understand what \"edge\" means for me. Edge\
  \ is a point crossing which it is impossible to go back. But what was before? Frankly,\
  \ my life is the same as the lives of millions of other students, who simply lose\
  \ their time and youth on things they don`t need, or just sit idle and torturing\
  \ others. But I decided to get out of this.\n\nDo you remember those good movies\
  \ where grandfather sits at the fireplace in the living room and tells his grandchildren\
  \ the story of his youth? Oh no, I don't identify myself with this grandfather,\
  \ because I'm not sure if I'll have a fireplace, living room or grandchildren in\
  \ the future. But this picture transmits as much as possible the things that occurs\
  \ before my eyes when I think about the future.\n\nSo, this grandfather tells them\
  \ how cool he lived. What would I tell? What did I see in my life? \"Children, would\
  \ you like to hear how I was sitting all day in the chair and watching a video on\
  \ YouTube?\" Absurd, isn`t it? \"Children, do you want to hear how I walked through\
  \ the Lysa Hora and met the pagans who gave me sushi?\"\n\nAnd I hear in my head\
  \ a ringing voice: \"Tell us about the pagans, grandfather! Tell us how you danced\
  \ the waltz on the central squares of Kyiv, Lviv, Chernihiv, Chernivtsi. Tell us\
  \ about Mount Makovytsia, on which you climbed together with your friends in the\
  \ snow and without any roads and landmarks. Tell us how you wrote an essay hoping\
  \ to get to Argentina.\"\n\nTo be clear at once I walked with my friend with desire\
  \ to see small Kiev waterfall. We got lost and went to it for almost three hours\
  \ but in the end the guard did not let us in. Therefore, we decided not to miss\
  \ the day and to climb on one hill \u2013 the Lysa Hora, which was famous for its\
  \ pagan temples. We were walking there for over an hour and came across a group\
  \ of people who took us sushi and wine and talked about Perun, an old Slavic god.\
  \ One of them said he was able to change the weather, but we did not check it.\n\
  \nAfter such an unusual meeting, I realized that nothing is impossible in life and\
  \ that I want to see more. More incredible trips and meetings!\n\nThe desire to\
  \ see something \u2013 that was the decision that pushed me to the edge, or, more\
  \ precisely, to change.\n\nThis essay not too interesting, not too dramatic or fun.\
  \ But it's mine. And so far, it changes me."
