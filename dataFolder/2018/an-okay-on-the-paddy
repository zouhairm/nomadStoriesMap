Text: "My first time to Japan, I chose to help plant rice in Toon, near Matsuyama\
  \ in the Ehime Prefecture in the southern Island of Shikoku, Japan.\n\nThe sun emerged\
  \ with the crisp spring air and work clothes on, we emerged to the outer edges where\
  \ the equipment was kept to put on our final foot coverings. Boots for this type\
  \ of farming are pulled on more like rubber gloves and are held on with a few sets\
  \ of rubber bands, just to make sure the mud doesn\u2019t suction them off. \n\n\
  A elderly farmer couple, neither of who spoke English, joined us with their tractor.\
  \ We got to the first field and I pantomimed to the farmer\u2019s wife that I was\
  \ going to help her. One fierce hand motion -  I would NOT be hand planting with\
  \ her. I could carry flats of pre-sprouted plants for the tractor. At the third\
  \ paddy, the sagely farmer decided it was my turn to drive the tractor. I looked\
  \ at the gears, all Japanese characters, but the saving grace was that the manufacture\
  \ had a turtle to rabbit scale for the speed.\n\nThe tractor almost sows the seedlings\
  \ into the mud, but like any driving lack of focus of the planting rows suffers.\
  \ So a little bit of a rough wiggly start, I suddenly saw the farmer hustle to the\
  \ end of the row where I should be headed. He stood straight as a stick arms by\
  \ his sides, willing me to straighten up. And as I got close to the end of the row,\
  \ he would lift his arms above his head making an \u201CO\u201D and loudly pronounce\
  \ \u201COK\u201D. So field after field, OK after OK, the brown muddy pools that\
  \ had cascaded the hill, slowly began filling with hopeful shouts of green.\n\n\
  A long day done, everyone headed back to their respective homes. After dinner, I\
  \ grabbed my camera to capture the last hour of light, to walk the hill and capture\
  \ the progress from the day. As I wandered to the top I suddenly realized I was\
  \ not alone. The stoic farmer was looking over the days work. No common words between\
  \ us, I motioned an apology for the imperfect rows I had planted. This stoic man\
  \ who hadn\u2019t cracked a smile all day pointed at my rice field squiggles and\
  \ with a glint in his eye, and a peak of a smile, clearly made is \u201CO\u201D\
  \ and said \u201COK\u201D.\n\nOn my last day in Japan, I found a stamp in Tokyo\
  \ of a long narrow man, arms lifted making a circle O with the letters OK. As I\
  \ sit at my desk, I\u2019m reminded that crooked lines can make an old farmer laugh,\
  \ connections can happen without a common language and everything will be OK!"
