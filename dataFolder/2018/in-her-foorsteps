Text: "I gripped her hand tightly as we crossed the ancient streets of Rome. \n\n\
  The sounds of the city swarmed around in a frenzied buzz.\n\nAs the next wave of\
  \ tourists bustled past us, I paused for a moment, feeling overwhelmed. \n\nThe\
  \ six of us made unlikely travel companions; my partner and I, our two children\
  \ and both our mothers. Three generations, aged between six and sixty.  \n\nFeeling\
  \ lost, I reached instinctively for my phone.\n\n\u201CMum, I know exactly where\
  \ we are,\u201D my six-year-old daughter said confidently, pulling something from\
  \ her pocket. \n\n\u201CI\u2019ve drawn us a map, just follow me. We won\u2019t\
  \ get lost.\u201D\n\n\u201CBut where are we going?\u201D her brother asked.\n\n\u201C\
  To all the places we are supposed to go to,\u201D she said simply. \n\nWe stared\
  \ at her; the hovering parents, the older brother, the proud grandmothers.  \n\n\
  And then we followed in her footsteps. \n\nI watched as she took it all in. Her\
  \ head tilting to listen to the sounds of opera pouring from a Juliet balcony overhead,\
  \ her face lighting up as she paused to watch the street performers, her wide-eyed\
  \ look as the fevered shouts of a televised football match spilled onto the streets.\
  \ \n\nAs we meandered and marveled, eventually arriving at the Pantheon, the two\
  \ children ran to the towering pillars and touched them instinctively. \n\n\u201C\
  Can you believe that the famous people we\u2019ve read about touched these same\
  \ pillars? It\u2019s like memories are stored in here,\u201D she said in amazement.\
  \ \n\nI was taken aback by her apt description. I understood all too well the other-worldly\
  \ feeling of touching an ancient physical thing and tuning into the cellular memories\
  \ contained within. But her ability to explain it so simply had me nodding as if\
  \ I understood it properly for the first time.  \n\nInside they were drawn to the\
  \ familiarity of technology, screens with headphones; an interactive exhibit on\
  \ the building\u2019s history. \n\nAs we continued on our hand-drawn journey we\
  \ heard the most detailed stories learned from their meeting of ancient history\
  \ and modern technology \u2013 the excited energy of learning shining through their\
  \ smiles. \n\nI\u2019d assumed it would be an anxious endeavor to travel with young\
  \ children. I\u2019d expected to teach them how to travel, how to marvel and how\
  \ to learn from other cultures. \n\nThe last thing I expected was to discover the\
  \ world by following in her footsteps."
