Text: "After one week hesitating if should I go or not, I was there,under a beautiful\
  \ sunny day, bells ringing, crowded streets of tourists in attempt to get a classical\
  \ picture along the canals with bicycles tied up around the iron structures of the\
  \ bridge with flowers decorating it. Amsterdam it it you!\n\nAt the end of a narrow\
  \ street I had from a receptionist a warm welcome and I felt confident enough to\
  \ ask: Can I talk with Christian? I sent email to him.\n\nShe politely answered\
  \ me there is no Christian here but the manager will talk with you for sure. The\
  \ manager came and kindly listened my request to exchange work for accommodation.\
  \ In a half hour I understood the Brazilians navy\xB4s motto which says: \u201C\
  luck accompanies the audacious people\u201D\n\nOn my first breakfast with the staff\
  \ members from the hostel before my first shift of cleaning the manager started\
  \ to pray I kept my eyes open just observing what is going on, during the dinner\
  \ and before sleeping, let\xB4s pray again! It turned out; Christian was not a man\
  \ as I thought but a religion which the hostel professes. A Christian community\
  \ in the middle of the red light district in Amsterdam.  \n\nAt night on the streets\
  \ another world, the atmosphere contributes to your emotion dictate your actions.\
  \ Coffeshops, a variety of food and bars, girls behind the windows. People from\
  \ everywhere experiencing what might be illegal in their country.\n\n I wanted to\
  \ know why establishing a business with a strong belief in this area and the answer\
  \ is: they really believe in being there is a duty to impact lives. Every night\
  \ they prayed for their guests and for the girls who exposed their bodies, hopping\
  \ that they could find a different source of happiness and love, named Jesus.\n\n\
  Everyone in that city is so peculiar; I met a refugee, ex junkie person, people\
  \ who were trying to live freely from their family\xB4s religion, or even far from\
  \ your economic broken country. I remember vividly a duty man, always watchful and\
  \ reserved, once he said with his strong Dutch accent \u201C if you go to behind\
  \ the window, I will kill you\u201D. I found a father, the protective one, by the\
  \ way.\n \n  What impressed me the most in this community it is that in times of\
  \ bigotry, homophobia, misogyny, they really embrace everybody, and they are coherent\
  \ with their speech about love. \n\nWhen I look at back I see people happy inside\
  \ and outside as well and what make them happy is the quality of the close relationship\
  \ they have weather with the world or with Jesus."
