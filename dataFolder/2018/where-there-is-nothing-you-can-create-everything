Text: "Two days before Christmas, Romania was covered in snow and I was far away from\
  \ it in a Safari car with Iqbal, our driver, and two other ladies, mother and daughter\
  \ who wanted to join the experience as well. I was right in the front seat, not\
  \ knowing what to expect.  It was 3 pm and we were slowly leaving Abu Dhabi behind\
  \ us. Sheikh Zayed Mosque became smaller and smaller in the rearview mirror and\
  \ all I could see were some locals\u2019 white houses and castles that banished\
  \ quickly behind the dunes of sand.\n \nFew minutes later, I found myself on a natural\
  \ roller-coaster. Iqbal was driving on the edge of every sand dune he could see,\
  \ going up and down in style. The cars in front of us were doing the same tricks,\
  \ but Iqbal always aimed higher. If one car was going up, he made sure he was surpassing\
  \ it. Sand was covering our windows; I wasn\u2019t scared. Out of nowhere, the desert\
  \ became a very dynamic place. I felt one with the arid region joining the desert\
  \ in its solitude. \n\nIqbar parked the car near a desert camp where dates, steaming\
  \ tea and Qahwa (Arabic coffee) were waiting for us. The camp was simple, yet very\
  \ attractive, with camels you could ride on, with a scene placed in the middle,\
  \ and pillows where you could sit on to watch the show. There were food, sheesha\
  \ and henna tattoos but my eyes fixed a nearby dune where people were doing sand\
  \ boarding. I hiked the dune barely breathing. My clothes were full of dust, the\
  \ sun was going down, and the air became colder. The sunset transformed everything\
  \ into a golden garden of sand. I fixed my legs on the board. I was barefoot; I\
  \ couldn\u2019t care less about falling. I couldn\u2019t wait for the soft blanket\
  \ of sand to catch me. The board was sinking slowly in the sand. \n\nAs I got closer,\
  \ I saw Iqbar waving at me. I could see the artists performing the Tanoura dance.\
  \ They raised their skirt above their heads and started spinning. I got dizzy only\
  \ watching. It was mesmerizing. The sky was now full of stars and the music was\
  \ charming. When one of the artists invited people to join him in his dance Iqbar\
  \ raised my hand for me. I had to go. Few seconds later all I can remember is that\
  \ I was spinning, and spinning, and spinning; trying to find a rhythm, hoping that\
  \ I won\u2019t fall. But in that circular movement, under the Arabic sky and music\
  \ I couldn\u2019t fall as I felt more balanced than ever. I found an extraordinary\
  \ sense of freedom and balance in the middle of desert and I didn\u2019t want to\
  \ stop."
