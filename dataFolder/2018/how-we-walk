Text: "When I walked through the door of  Servicio de Interpretac\xEDon Altas Cumbres\
  \ in Capileira, midday to check in with Paco, I expected the same friendly greeting\
  \ I had encountered the last two mornings. Wrong. His stern countenance indicated\
  \ that he was not happy with me. \u201CAllison, how many times have you been to\
  \ the top of Mulhacen? Why did you walk so fast? You were supposed to stay up there\
  \ and breath in the fresh air;  to take in the beauty of the surroundings. You can\
  \ always walk around the bottom section. In fifteen days time, you will not be able\
  \ to be at the summit.\u201D Paco\u2019s frown deepened.  \u201CThe mountain is\
  \ not homework. It is not meant to be completed just to be done.\u201D I sighed\
  \ and hung my head in shame. Joder.  \n\n\u201CI have no time for this impatience,\u201D\
  \ he continued. \u201CThat is not what life is about. When do you plan to return\
  \ here?\u201D \u201D No s\xE9,\u201D I replied. \u201CExactly and it won't be the\
  \ same as it was today. The mountains are never the same. They are always changing\
  \ and so is life.\u201D At this point I was near tears. He was right. Spot on. I\
  \ should have walked at a slower pace. What was the hurry? To keep up with my the\
  \ Romanian ironmen I had chosen to walk with? I\u2019d likely never see them again.\
  \ \n\n\u201CI drove by you yesterday at five on the road to Bubion and you were\
  \ on a mission.\u201D He didn\u2019t stop. I don't blame him; my pace demonstrated\
  \ a blatant disregard for my surroundings.\n\nPicking up on my sensitivity, Paco\
  \ changed directions. He made a joke and put his hands over mine. \u201CWell, Allison,\
  \ what now?\u201D I shrugged in mild despair. \u201CPues, here is what you should\
  \ do.\u201D He pulled out a small map and laid out a different walk through lower\
  \ villages of the Alpujarras.  A line was building of people waiting to talk to\
  \ him. It was time he attended to them. I whispered that I was going next door for\
  \ a coffee, eyes pleading forgiveness, hoping that the others hadn't picked up on\
  \ my mild scolding. He called after me, \u201CYou must come back shortly and I will\
  \ give you the details.\u201D His eye contact was firm. The others looked back and\
  \ forth between us, unsure of what they had missed. \n\nThe best teachers I have\
  \ ever had have always been tough, but fair. Just as not all classrooms have four\
  \ walls, the greatest educators share their wisdom gained through experiences and\
  \ seasoned knowledge, not textbooks. Paco never let me off the hook for speeding\
  \ through the landscape which he so clearly cherishes. He made me stop and think:\
  \ How do I want to walk? Vaya Con D\xEDos!"
