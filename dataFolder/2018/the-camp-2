Text: "When Greek islands come to mind, most people would think of the sun. The sea.\
  \ White houses with blue windows. Maybe even a Greek salad. Some would think of\
  \ crazy beach parties, some others might recall this so very sensational feeling\
  \ of the bare salted skin lying on the warm sand. \n\nLeros is no different in many\
  \ aspects. A tiny little island in the Aegean, next to the Turkish borders. The\
  \ sun is there. The sea is there. The houses, the Greek salad, all there.  \n\n\
  The Hotspot is also there. Camps filled with refugees in a corner of the island.\
  \ In a carefully hidden I should say corner of the island. If you've had one too\
  \ many shots the previous night, you probably wouldn\u2019t even notice that the\
  \ island has more refugees than tourists. But look a bit closer and you'll see the\
  \ kids walking, playing, shouting along the sea coast. Discovering their new temporary\
  \ home.\n\nIt was there, along the sea coast under the midday sun, that I spotted\
  \ from the other side of the cobbled street a scarfed lady talking to a grandma\
  \ outside a tiny little house. They were talking loudly, loudly and quickly, one\
  \ over the other. One in Greek, the other one in a language very foreign to me.\n\
  The volume of the voices was steadily increasing, as if the higher decibels would\
  \ act as an interpreter. I could see the scarfed lady offering the grandma the gold\
  \ cross she had around her neck. The grandma refused by pushing the scarfed lady's\
  \ hands away and the scene, this exact same scene, continued for a minute or so\
  \ with the two sets of hands moving quickly one towards and one against the other.\
  \  \n\nI am pretty sure that the scene, this exact same scene, could have continued\
  \ for a while if it wasn't for the two kids. I had been so hypnotised by the repetitive\
  \ movements that I hadn't even noticed them sitting on a table just behind the grandma,\
  \ eating some food. At this moment I wasn't sure whose kids these were, they looked\
  \ surprisingly alike. But then they stood up and started running around, laughing\
  \ and looking at each other, each with a clear orbit around only one of the women.\
  \ The scarfed lady stopped the rotation of her satellite and for a moment there\
  \ was a surprising quietness. Until the laughter of the kids broke the silence again.\
  \ All four sets of hands waved goodbye as only two of them took the road towards\
  \ the direction of the camp.\n\nThe carefully hidden from us tourists camp. But\
  \ for the locals, locals by birth or locals by necessity, the camp was clearly part\
  \ of their daily lives."
