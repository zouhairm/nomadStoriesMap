  \ colour, good food and beautiful peolple. I'll tell you this amazing story step\
  \ by step: how i said before during an experience in Malta i decided to start this\
  \ adventureand this is why i\xB4m in this beautiful place! Brasil is an amazing\
  \ country full of everything; from the north to the south all shouts \"come here\"\
  . who don't know the Amazonian Forest? i think no one. Probably when someone tell\
  \ about the heaven in Earth thinks on it. is simply beautiful, full of colour, life\
  \ and surprise: behind every tree you can find a magnific view. when you walk inside\
  \ you everytime you wonder \"how is it possible? am i really here?\". you cannot\
  \ imagine, just live it! \nmoving us to the noth-east we'll find a married between\
  \ the desert and the ocean, I'm talking about the National park of Len\xE7ois Maranhenses\
  \ where, during the rains season, is possible to see the sunset with blue lagoons,\
  \ the ocean and the barrier reef on background. anything else? \nBut now we'll leave\
  \ the for a moment the nature to discover some of the best citiy in Brasil: Recife.\
  \ With its nice beaches, nightlife, bar, discos, is impossible to get boring. You\
  \ can  the best beaches in Brasil for this reason is one of the most sought after\
  \ destinations from lovers of the sea, but is not all; is called the Venice of Brasil\
  \ for his historical centre full of water channels and old buildings as  the theater\
  \ of  St. Isabel, the convent of St. Antonio, the cathedral of St. Pietro and the\
  \ museum of the state of Pernambuco. \nMention separeted deserves Salvador. The\
  \ location in the centre of the country, the history and the great beaches, make\
  \ it one of the most tourist destination. Built during the colonial era, presents\
  \ a strong african influence mixed to an european culture expressed especially in\
  \ the strong religiosity. Pelourinho is the most iconic neighborhood, full of old\
