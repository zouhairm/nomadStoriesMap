Text: "The power of simple things \n\nFinally, I decided to quit my soul sucking,\
  \ creativity killing job and now all I wanted was to detox and go abroad to an exotic\
  \ location. But since I left my job, funds were insufficient so I reluctantly settled\
  \ for this place called Auli in Uttarakhand( India).\nI got this piece of information\
  \ from the internet that ski lessons are provided there and that made me look forward\
  \ to it. My childhood friend came with me and we left from Delhi for what was a\
  \ long journey. We switched from bus to a taxi when we reached Rishikesh. The taxi\
  \ driver told us that it's a wrong time to be in Auli as it's March-ending already\
  \ and snow must have melted now and he added that there is nothing to see there.\
  \ I got paranoid with disappointment. Somehow, I had fallen asleep dreading what\
  \ lied ahead of us and what awakened me was the scent of petrichor and drizzle on\
  \ my face. I thought I was dreaming. The air quality had changed and we were amidst\
  \ the green mountains. There was something in that breeze, something in that drizzle\
  \ that melted my grogginess. I turned to my friend and told her that we should see\
  \ for ourselves what this place would be like and the idea of beauty is different\
  \ for everyone so we need not worry about what the taxi driver said. \nWe decided\
  \ to stay at a resort. For the ski lessons we had to go to the upper slopes. When\
  \ we reached the upper slopes I can only see pockets of snow here and there but\
  \ that was no way sufficient for skiing. I felt like an idiot with my skiing gear\
  \ on but the guide was so adamant that we ski on the soft snow. My friend cheerfully\
  \ suggested that since we have come so far it wouldn't hurt to just try and at least\
  \ we will have some basic idea in the future about skiing. So I tried and fell on\
  \ my butt. I saw people laugh at me and I laughed at myself. \nWe got rid of the\
  \ heavy gear and just started to play in the snow and lay there watching the sparkling\
  \ blue sky, with the background sound of coniferous trees rustling in the air. The\
  \ great mountains seemed to guard us while we lay in the snow. I felt safe. I felt\
  \ like I\u2019m home. \n Everything was there, the green, the white, tiny colourful\
  \ flowers amidst the grass and soothing fresh air. And for all these I didn\u2019\
  t have to spend a fortune or go abroad as I had thought earlier. This was the last\
  \ thing I had expected that I\u2019ll find the joy and healing that I was seeking\
  \ in such simple yet powerful things."
