Text: "It was a day before my 23rd birthday in Camino de Santiago (The Way of Saint\
  \ James) in Spain. My best friend and I had been walking for two weeks and had already\
  \ encountered all the celebrities of the way \u2014 blisters, pain, heat, cold,\
  \ rain and snoring monsters (there\u2019s always one in the dormitory of albergue\
  \ \u2014 hostel for pilgrims). Don\u2019t get me wrong \u2014 we loved all of it.\
  \ We learned to perform self-surgeries (you pin your blister with a needle, dry\
  \ over night and hope for the love of God that it is fine next morning). Every cold\
  \ water source on the road including ocean, rivers, old public laundries and water\
  \ fountains met swollen beasts that once used to be our feet. We were sunburn, dirty,\
  \ hungry, exhausted, but man we laughed a lot. Everything was funny and old problems\
  \ seemed to be just overthinking.\n That day we came to albergue which was run by\
  \ a Spanish guy who quit his business, sold everything and moved to mountains to\
  \ make a shelter for pilgrims. He cooked all the meal for us, he did everyone\u2019\
  s laundry, he didn\u2019t ask for any money and the most important thing \u2014\
  \ he always smiled. His eyes were sparkling. We instantly felt it was a special\
  \ place. During dinner we met two guys, Hungarian and French, and after a few hours\
  \ of jokes, stories, card tricks and wine we decided to camp in the mountains the\
  \ following day.\n Next morning we bought food and water supplies for two days and\
  \ with all that weight we started climbing the steep trail. The view was breathtaking\
  \ and the mountains echoed from our songs. When it was time to settle guys found\
  \ a perfect place off the road where the fog somehow hid us from other people but\
  \ we could still see all the magnificent landscape. The night was full of stars.\
  \ We cooked our food on fire and even improvised a cake \u2014 something out of\
  \ apples, honey and nuts. I swear it was the most delicious food on the entire planet.\
  \ That night we played many games to get to know each other. The feeling that we\
  \ were the only people on this planet, that we might never see each other again,\
  \ that there was no past or future except for this moment made us utterly open.\
  \ We were here and now completely \u2014 with ourselves, with each other, with nature,\
  \ with stars and endless sky in the flowing beauty of every enfolding moment. That\
  \ night I got to know these strangers more than I know most of my friends. \n I\
  \ learned that freedom from expectations reveal miracles. They are always there,\
  \ we often just don\u2019t pay enough attention to notice them."
