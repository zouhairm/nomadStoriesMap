Text: "This is how I met a guy in Lisbon and ended up seeing an unlikely phenomenon\
  \ in the Atacama Desert. You see, when you meet someone, he has plans. Things happen\
  \ unexpectedly, but they happen nonetheless. And if you see a golden fish heading\
  \ towards the sea, you follow him. You just go.\n\nYou should\u2019ve seen the look\
  \ of my never-have-left-Europe mother when I said I was going. It was like I was\
  \ joining a guerrilla. The plan was simple. A leave of absence for two months to\
  \ meet him in Lima after two flights. We would go north, to Ecuador and we could\
  \ even fly to the Galapagos Island. A lovely plan. Didn\u2019t happen. \n\nIt was\
  \ almost time and he was far in the south. \xABWhat about Atacama?\xBB. You just\
  \ go. After four flights, I found myself in a bus to San Pedro de Atacama. Looking\
  \ out the window it\u2019s like a parallax effect, the never-ending plain keeps\
  \ moving fast, but the mountains in the horizon stand still. San Pedro is like an\
  \ oasis in middle of the desert. Its center remains untouched: houses in adobe that\
  \ can only be painted in colors allowed by the local government. Also, parties are\
  \ not allowed, so it doesn\u2019t become Chile\u2019s Ibiza. You can imagine there\
  \ are lots of clandestine ones.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t there. Looking at a map, it was\
  \ annoying to see how close we were. He was in Argentina, but then the Andes happened.\
  \ Winter started with unexpected snow that blocked almost all border connections\
  \ between Chile, Bolivia and Argentina. He tried to cross and went back. Twice.\n\
  \nI was in a hostel called Tatai\u2019s, and quietly felt my rhythm change. It was\
  \ peacefully sweating during the day and risking a cold by night. Without the daily\
  \ routine, you feel you gain hours of life. One day, going out for ice cream, I\
  \ saw him coming. He had to cross through Bolivia in an unreasonably long trip.\
  \ No need to describe that feeling.\n\nWe went to see the local treasures by bike,\
  \ the Death and the Moon Valley. We got to know the volcanoes around, tasted good\
  \ Pisco Sour, talked with tourism agencies, and started to plan where to go next.\
  \ Bolivia through the closest border seemed great and it was about to open, they\
  \ said. It was time to go. We were buying the tickets the next day. \n\nWhen we\
  \ woke up it was freezing. It had been snowing all night. And as we walked hopelessly\
  \ to the bus station, we saw this endlessly white desert, so rare that life seemed\
  \ to have stopped without knowing what to do. The roads were closed. Again. And\
  \ we got stuck in the driest desert of all, surrounded by snow."
