Text: "In a single day in Lisbon, Portugal I fed a peacock, climbed a pantheon and\
  \ discovered a carnival-themed sardine shop. I walked alongside the beach at sunset,\
  \ charged my phone outside by a solar-powered tree structure, and had to reassure\
  \ myself that Lisbon is not home to the Golden Gate Bridge or Brazil\u2019s Christ\
  \ the Redeemer statue, but rather, home to two structures that just look eerily\
  \ similar. My time in Lisbon was beautifully, random.\n\nAfter spending only three\
  \ short days in the city, I can\u2019t say that everything I experienced, saw and\
  \ ate was the culture of Lisbon. But what I do know for sure is that I felt a strong\
  \ sense of something from this place, a type of identity, I guess. From Lisbon,\
  \ I felt color. It was everywhere, from the tile-plated buildings to the appropriately\
  \ named \u201Cpink street\u201D a road where not the homes but the ground itself\
  \ is drenched in pink. The city\u2019s many high terraces offer breathtaking views\
  \ of the sea and the sky and colored buildings from every angle imaginable.\n\n\
  But Lisbon wasn\u2019t only colorful in terms of its visual appeal. No-this city\u2019\
  s quirky vibrancy came from its people, its history. And this colorful eccentricity\
  \ was summed up no better than in Lisbon\u2019s Feira da Ladra street market. My\
  \ friend Bobbi and I heard the market was cool, and that's all we needed to know.\
  \ On Saturday, we took the trek to Alfama.\n\nIn Alfama, you can find just about\
  \ anything-and more. And by more, I mean that Alfama is where you find those things\
  \ that exist only beyond the realm of your imagination. Only in Alfama could you\
  \ find zipper change purses made from empty toothpaste bottles, lamp shades sold\
  \ next to headless baby dolls, or a life-size stone body cutout with organs painted\
  \ on and a photographed face pasted on the head. Yeah, that one was hard to explain.\
  \ This market had earrings made from old bike tires; I even came across possibly\
  \ the last Blockbuster video in existence, never returned. Some vendors sold clothes,\
  \ underwear, sunglasses; others antique cameras and old records. This was a market\
  \ for Alfama\u2019s people, but for tourists too. Here, you can buy incredibly hand-painted\
  \ tiles, ceramics and goods made from cork, all staples of Lisbon\u2019s rich culture\
  \ and history.\n\nThe strange, the common, the beautiful and the completely unexpected\
  \ can all be found mixed up in Alfama, and now that I think about it, I guess the\
  \ same can be said for Lisbon too."
