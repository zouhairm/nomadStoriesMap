Text: "It\u2019s awful, I know, but I have to admit: I thought I loved traveling until\
  \ I realized I didn\u2019t.\nI had always thought I was meant to travel, that I\
  \ was an adventurous creature born to take off and explore no matter what big city\
  \ or tropical forest. \nSadly it was just something I made up based on things I\
  \ saw on tv or read somewhere. Everything looked so easy. \nTruth is traveling is\
  \ tough.\nI hated traveling as much as I hated Madagascar. I hated it all. \nI hated\
  \ the crowd the empty street, the burning sun, the freezing nights, the four hour\
  \ trip for the forty kilometer distance, the silence, the loudness, the carrots\
  \ for breakfast, lunch and dinner. \nYes, I hated the land of the lemurs, the cutest\
  \ creatures on Earth. So what?\nI hated it so much that I suddenly, desperately,\
  \ unexpectedly fell in love with it with the same force. \nIt was shocking, sudden\
  \ and slow at the same time.\nIt happened around the second week  of my non profit\
  \ holiday and I didn\u2019t see it coming.\nI was sitting on the side seat of an\
  \ old, uncomfortable, and squeaky van. The landscape was gently shaping the red\
  \ hills into different rocky colors and I simply woke up. \nI felt like a warm welcome,\
  \ hissed by nature itself. I was part of it, happy and free just because of that.\
  \ The exact sensation was that  of thin roots growing under my skin anchoring to\
  \ the ground yet freeing me from a fake cage. \nFrom that moment on everything changed\
  \ because, I guess, I changed.\nI realized that everything was bigger than me and\
  \ yet I fitted right in and I started enjoying it. \nSleeping by the sea with the\
  \ ocean roaring in the distance is scary.\nBeing brushed by a bull running from\
  \ the fighting pit is really scary.\nLiving in houses made of mud that you are forced\
  \ to build every year round after the rain season ends is sadly scary. \nAnd the\
  \ scariest thing is discovering that lemurs are pets of the jungle as the big yellow\
  \ spiders are. \nBut still I was part of it and I liked it.\nIt is very easy to\
  \ praise the many beauties of Madagascar, the sky is so ridiculously close you feel\
  \ you have the super sight, but you are just a human being and that\u2019s ok.\n\
  Nature throws you out from your comfort zone and slaps the truth right in front\
  \ of you, being comfortable is not part of it and has never been. \nBack home I\
  \ felt empowered for a long while until the urge to leave kicked in again.\nMadagascar\u2019\
  s landscapes taught me what travel is meant for and I feel deeply grateful for this,\
  \ even if I couldn\u2019t eat carrots ever since."
