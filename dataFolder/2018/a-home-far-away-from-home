Text: "My story goes back to a point in my life when travelling wasn\u2019t a major\
  \ part of it. Growing up in a small town in Germany, I was always taught that hard\
  \ work pays off and a good and secure job is what you should work for. Then when\
  \ I got rewarded with a scholarship for a study program at a big American firm,\
  \ I felt so proud and honoured. I thought that the life of my dreams as a young\
  \ professional in marketing was around the corner. However, the honest truth was,\
  \ I hated what I was doing and felt trapped. At the same time, I sensed this inner\
  \ unrest and I wasn\u2019t in peace with myself. It was this point that I knew I\
  \ have to do some serious soul searching. I decided that I have to give back something\
  \ to those in need in order to find myself. Against all negative tendencies from\
  \ my surrounding, I ripped up my 5 year plan and made a choice: Travel South America\
  \ and give back as much as you can to poor communities. No sooner said than done:\
  \ I sold everything I had, packed my bags, booked my flights and stranded in the\
  \ colourful town of Cartagena, Colombia. I had no idea what I was doing or where\
  \ I was going. After some beginner\xB4s mistakes, I eventually made it to there\
  \ and that\xB4s where my story about making local friends just began. I remember\
  \ like it were yesterday, how I was sitting on the dirty floor in front of the airport\
  \ in the scorching sun, waiting for this guy from the language school to pick me\
  \ up. I started to count the endless dried-out leaves of the palm trees around.\
  \ Two hours rapidly felt like days and I started to doubt the whole concept of travelling.\
  \ All of a sudden, those horrible tales about girls travelling solo came up and\
  \ I felt lost. I couldn\u2019t stop thinking: \u201CWhere am I?\u201D So I guess\
  \ at some point, I started crying, clinging my backpack and hoping that my mom is\
  \ around the corner to take her little girl home. Then at this moment of total insecurity,\
  \ a young Colombian girl with big brown eyes dropped by and grabbed my hand and\
  \ said: \u201CBuena suerte para t\xEC\u201D which means good luck. Instead of leaving\
  \ me alone, the girl just sat next to me until the guy finally showed up. This was\
  \ a turning point for me; I realized that it is not just about the physical and\
  \ natural beauty you may encounter. Instead, it is more about the people who are\
  \ on this journey with you. For me, it was also the first time that I felt home\
  \ so far away from home. It was the moment, when I understood that travelling is\
  \ more about local connections, it\xB4s about making profound covenants and leaving\
  \ stereotypes behind."
