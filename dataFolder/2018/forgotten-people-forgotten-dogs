Text: "The Baja desert is subtlety. Everything bites and is beautiful. The nuances,\
  \ gentle and potent. To experience its bustling energy, you must be patient. \n\n\
  Giant cardons guard the landscape. Curious beetles make friends with hikers. Night-blooming\
  \ cereus grow a single flower per year, one night only. It\u2019s no wonder pockets\
  \ of life go unnoticed. \n\nThis is where La Huerta sits. Only 70 people and an\
  \ empty church live here. Over the years, officials have come and gone taking with\
  \ them their empty promises. No one has kept their word, until Olivia. \n  \nI\u2019\
  d been living the privileged, gringa lifestyle when she offered to share this place\
  \ with me. A passionate force of nature she loves her home and is of constant service.\
  \ Even though I had no idea what to expect, I eagerly agreed. She warned me that\
  \ the people are extremely poor. I was ready.\n\nShe stumbled upon La Huerta accidentally.\
  \ Curious of the many strays she stopped to inquire. Her focus is to sterilize companion\
  \ animals, reducing unwanted pregnancies along with noise, mess, and chaos. Help\
  \ the animals to help the people.\n\nWe stop in at Lola's. A tiny woman with a giant\
  \ smile, she welcomed us warmly. Jalapeneo cans holding pretty plants hung on the\
  \ walls while several more sat tucked in corners. Dogs and cats stroll through for\
  \ attention and food. Sweet Lola, who\u2019s home is pieced together with old boards\
  \ and a leaky roof, earns her living selling goat cheese to the rare passerby. She\
  \ doesn\u2019t consider herself poor. She knows there\u2019s always someone worse\
  \ off.\n\nLa Huerta is the first town after the capital so unwanted pets are dumped\
  \ here. Olivia assists but it\u2019s never-ending. Lola helps. \n\nShe walks everywhere\
  \ and was particularly excited about her new shoes. Imagine not having proper footwear\
  \ somewhere as unforgiving as the desert. Lola was more than happy to set aside\
  \ her worn out pair for something more comfortable.\n\nThis trip is not about shoes\
  \ or dogs. With no electricity, these visits are connection to the outside world,\
  \ bridging the gap more than anything else.\n\nI listen while Lola and her neighbor\
  \ speak of being broke with menopause and of doctors who don\u2019t heal but harm\
  \ through fraud. They inform us of the dogs who need help or cause trouble. Mostly\
  \ they laugh. Boisterous, uninhibited giggles. The contagious kind. \n\nEven I\u2019\
  m in stitches with my poor Spanish because laughter is universal and a smile is\
  \ medicine. With a good sense of humour and comfortable shoes you can endure most\
  \ anything."
