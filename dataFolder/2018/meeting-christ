Text: "\u201CGood afternoon ma\u2019am.  Welcome to Israel.  Your bus awaits you just\
  \ at the entrance,\u201D the cheerful guide greeted me as I was emerging out of\
  \ immigration formalities in Eilat having crossed the border in Taba from Egypt.\
  \  I was a single female in my late 30s traveling with a group of pilgrims from\
  \ India and we were on a 9-day Holy Land tour.  For my fellow travelers and I, this\
  \ part of the world had long held our imagination. \nHaving arrived in Israel on\
  \ Dec 21, the atmosphere was thick with the festive spirit of Christmas,  Totaling\
  \ 60 in number and differing in ages from 6 to 90, we had a good mix of a dozen\
  \ senior citizens in their 80s and 90s thrown in. \nAs the itinerary would have\
  \ it, we were at the Church of Nativity in Bethlehem on Christmas Eve.  As we got\
  \ off the bus, the police personnel said \u201CSir, as part of security measures,\
  \ we cannot allow any vehicles including taxis to go up to the church.\u201D  This\
  \ meant we had to walk a good 500 meters uphill to reach the church and most of\
  \ the group started out.  I saw child-like excitement give way to fallen expressions\
  \ in the faces of the senior citizens.  Some of them could not walk more than a\
  \ couple of steps and they returned back into the bus.  \nEven as I continued gazing,\
  \ the guide quickly climbed into the bus.  He said \u201CIt\u2019s Christmas Eve.\
  \  You have all come so far.   C\u2019mon get up y\u2019all.  You are going to make\
  \ it to the church one way or the other.\u201D   The twinkle returned back to their\
  \ eyes.  He helped them all down and asked some of us \u201Ccan you help?\u201D\
  \  \u201CWhy, surely,\u201D we jumped in.   He quickly gave instructions to 5 of\
  \ us to take 2 seniors each and we were to accompany them taking them by hand to\
  \ make our way up the church.   He was to follow us with his own share of seniors\
  \ at the rear.\nUncle and Aunty Xavier clasped my hands tightly as they made their\
  \ way up huffing and puffing.  It was a journey of faith and courage that saw them\
  \ look ahead and smile faintly as they paused to rest and take a deep breath every\
  \ few steps.   When we finally made it to the church, a magnificent building adorned\
  \ with beautiful decor, huge pillars, and vast corridors, we joined a long queue\
  \ of tourists from all over the world.\nI turned back and saw the guide having made\
  \ his way with the last of the seniors.  Even as he acknowledged me with a thumps-up\
  \ sign, I remembered Christ\u2019s words \u201CWhatever you do to the least of my\
  \ brothers, you do unto me.\u201D  I smiled back at him, my eyes full having met\
  \ Christ in a way I had expected the least."
