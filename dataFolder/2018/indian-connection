Text: "Either you love it, or you hate it. Few words to wrap up the welcoming spicy\
  \ taste of a cup of Masala tea, the inexplicable sense of peace found in a chaotic\
  \ market under a heavy monsoon rain and the instinctive sense of trust towards a\
  \ person you just met, among many others who can cheat on you just because you are\
  \ a tourist. Few words I heard several times to picture the same, unique, country:\
  \ India.\n\nI flew to India because of materialistic business reasons.  Nevertheless,\
  \ in the humid, dirty and crowded but full of spirit, Varanasi, I lived my Indian\
  \ connection.\n\nStretched along the sacred river Ganges, Varanasi is a labyrinth\
  \ of narrow streets, where the existences of pilgrims, tourists, beggars, cows and\
  \ bikers crash continuously. In the Hindu culture, the city is a holy crossing place,\
  \ where the devotees can access to the divine after death.\n\nIn a hot summer afternoon,\
  \ I ended up in Manikarnika Ghat, the crematory ground. Along both sides of the\
  \ small roads driving down to the Ganges, storages for firewood and barbershops\
  \ replaced the usual artisanal shops. White-dressed men, totally shaved, were walking\
  \ up and down. The feeling of being the only European woman was stronger than ever.\
  \ Black columns of smoke were rising high in the sky.\n\nA path up the hill took\
  \ me to the wide terrace on the Ganges where two lines of funeral pyres were burning.\
  \ I hesitated. No woman is admitted to funeral ceremonies, since her crying could\
  \ retain the soul from undertaking its trip to heaven. On the point of leaving that\
  \ limbo, a man with long grey hair and apparently no age looked at me and invited\
  \ me to follow him on the terrace. Suddenly, that seemed the most natural thing\
  \ to do.\nI could see the shape of the burning bodies and I was so close to the\
  \ fire to feel it on my skin. The smoke was filling up my lungs. My eyes started\
  \ to water. The ashes coming from the pyres were covering my clothes. The man was\
  \ sitting on the opposite side of the terrace, with crossed legs and his hands in\
  \ a praying position. We stared at each other for a long moment. I could not leave,\
  \ although my body wanted to. Somehow, he was keeping me there. Our minds, our lives,\
  \ connected for a while. A sense of suffocation woke me up. I left, without looking\
  \ back.\n\nFew days later, during a trip on Himalaya, I learnt about the existence\
  \ of some ascetic men who can read your mind and predict the future. I will never\
  \ know if that guy in Varanasi was one of them, but I won\u2019t easily forget that\
  \ moment."
