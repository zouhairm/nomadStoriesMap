Text: "Let me immerse you in the dream that is Koh Lanta. Close your eyes. Now close\
  \ them again & count to 5, slowly. Breath deeply, deeper than you\u2019ve breathed\
  \ all day. Try not to rush, you\u2019ll never get these 5 seconds back & they\u2019\
  re yours for the keeping. And for my storytelling. \n\nKoh Lanta is exhaling after\
  \ holding your breath. It\u2019s feeling your tummy gently untensing and falling\
  \ softly outwards. It\u2019s the muscles in your cheeks & around your mouth relaxing.\
  \ Your first go at bashful eyecontact with the locals before you\u2019re used to\
  \ it. The looking up from underneath your eyelashes like Diana did, like a doe,\
  \ uncertain, but curious. \n\nKoh Lanta is waking up for the sunrise outside your\
  \ bamboo doors over the sea. It\u2019s watching the swallows dip gracefully in &\
  \ out of the water in a morning dance for you, weaving around each other over the\
  \ rooftops & through the mangroves. It\u2019s closing your eyes in Birmingham &\
  \ opening them again in Neverland.\n\nForget your worry that Thailand is over touristified\
  \ & ruined with drunk English sunburnt\u2019s that have already found all the secrets.\
  \ It isn\u2019t true. There is a shimmering magic here that can\u2019t be broken.\
  \ It\u2019s in everything. It\u2019s in the air. It\u2019s sweet & warm & it smells\
  \ of sunshine & foreign washing powders somehow reminiscent of your childhood ones.\
  \ It\u2019s in the gentle nature of the locals. Their hesitant desire to touch as\
  \ they talk, to make your interaction more intimate & to show you they\u2019re listening.\
  \ It\u2019s in the pace. And the connections you make because you\u2019ve slowed\
  \ it down\n\nI met South African Jolene. Complete with flaming locks of auburn hair,\
  \ ivory skin & eyes of emerald green. She was tucked away in a starlit jungle treehouse,\
  \ practising reiki with her bongo playing filmmaker, weaving dreams & wall hangings\
  \ with equal mastery. I sailed with Captain Jack Sparrow. Locally known as Laurie\
  \ - actually Australian & living on Koh Lanta for the last 20 years. There was Sam,\
  \ the wizened old Vipassana master, naked from the waist up bar the stripy braces\
  \ that held up his trousers. Sam with his enormous tummy, his bouncy walk, & his\
  \ twinkly eyes. And Sareena. With her unabashed, happy waving & shouting your name\
  \ as you drew near.\n\nWe are made to Love & to connect. So slow down, if you\u2019\
  re able. Pull down the invisible walls you\u2019ve built around you & step over\
  \ the chalk border line. Profess your affections whatever the outcome & never be\
  \ afraid to bare your soul. It\u2019s high time for eye contact again, & time to\
  \ come back to life"
