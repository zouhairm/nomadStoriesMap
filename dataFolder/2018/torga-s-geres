Text: "As most of us eventually find out, finding a tangible direction that can guide\
  \ our life is a pretty hard task. In my case, this realization came after two years\
  \ of tedious, soul draining study of Law at Coimbra University. To help with that\
  \ interior illness that afflicted me, I prescribed myself the reading of every book\
  \ written by any of my country\u2019s poets that I could find. Amidst the poems\
  \ that passed through my hands, I came across the annunciation \u201CThere are places\
  \ in the world that are like certain human existences: everything comes together\
  \ so that nothing is missing from their greatness and perfection. This Ger\xEAs\
  \ is one of these places.\u201D This quote of a poem by Miguel Torga, product of\
  \ the poet\u2019s lifelong connection with what today is the National Park of Peneda-Ger\xEA\
  s, struck me. It did so because it related the possibility of \u2018greatness and\
  \ perfection\u2019 found in individuals to a single location, older than our species,\
  \ which embodied those traits.\nI was quickly infected by the urge of exploring\
  \ the object of the poet\u2019s admiration and as soon as I could I packed some\
  \ of Torga\u2019s books instead of a compass and jumped on a bus to Ger\xEAs. Three\
  \ hours into the trip, green became everything I could see through the bus\u2019\
  s windows and the road started subtly melting into the shape of the increasingly\
  \ mountainous terrain. After one hour of curves the tight mountains suddenly opened\
  \ and the river C\xE1vado appeared, a wide carpet in the base of the valley, turned\
  \ orange by the setting sun. I had arrived at Ger\xEAs.\nIn the early morning I\
  \ joyously accepted Dona Maria\u2019s (the friendly old aged caretaker of the modest\
  \ camping site I spent the night at) offer of a sandwich filled with the creamiest\
  \ local cheese and spiced chorizo and made my way to the start of the trail that\
  \ lead to the Pedra Bela, a stone located in the peak of one of the highest mountain\
  \ that constitute Ger\xEAs\u2019s mountain range. The trail was rocky, enclosed\
  \ by pine trees and a single, lonely apple tree that helped calm my growing hunger.\
  \ I arrived at the peak close to midday, sweating and thankfull for Dona Maria\u2019\
  s lunch. At the peak, the view was everything. The tree lined mountains reached\
  \ effortlessly into the cloudless blue sky, while the water of the C\xE1vado flowed\
  \ calmly, undisturbed by my presence.\nThis was none other than the spot where Miguel\
  \ Torga had written the passage I mentioned and many more of his best poems. As\
  \ a breeze cooled me down and the fresh air filled my lungs, I understood why."
