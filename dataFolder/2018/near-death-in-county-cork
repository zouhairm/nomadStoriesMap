Text: "Body language is a beautiful thing.  Embarking on a backpacking stint across\
  \ Europe imposes a steep learning curve for both language and culture as one incessantly\
  \ jumps borders, however hitchhiking in hindsight, was an almost perilous way to\
  \ make local connections.\n\nAlready a travel-tragic by age 18, Europe was my second\
  \ continent notched (third if you count home).  I was travelling solo after a screaming\
  \ match outside of Amsterdam\u2019s central railway station with my obsessive British\
  \ travel companion of one week.  Excited but petrified to be on my own, I bravely\
  \ purchased a ticket to Munich\u2019s Oktoberfest.\n\nIt was in Cologne whilst on\
  \ my way to the German booze up I met the vivacious and inspiring Canadian Anne.\
  \  Ten years my senior, this party girl glowing with positivity, instantly became\
  \ my travel mentor.  It was her innocent advice that I later regretted taking, \u201C\
  It\u2019s totally safe to hitchhike solo as a woman in Ireland\u201D.\n\nFast forward\
  \ several months and I found myself climbing into a car with Father O\u2019Patrick\
  \ from Ballyshannon who promptly dropped me outside a pub insisting I try a Guinness\
  \ - surely a sign from God I was being protected?  After several more bizarre trips;\
  \ one with a concerned nun, another with a scar faced 007 villain almost breaking\
  \ the sound barrier and a crazy French woman who leant out the moving car to consume\
  \ some unidentified plant matter; my confidence began to dwindle.   When a husband\
  \ and wife team pulled up to my thumbed request for Cork, I instantly felt safe.\n\
  \ \nI threw my backpack on the backseat and hopped in.  The female passenger asked\
  \ me what I did for a living.  \u201CI\u2019m a writer\u201D I proudly retorted.\
  \  Motioning to the driver she replied \u201CFred\u2019s a writer too aren\u2019\
  t you dear? He\u2019s writes stories about killing backpackers!\u201D A spine-chilling\
  \ silence prevailed.\n\nAn hour later I woke up in the back of the car to guttural\
  \ shouting. \u201CGET THE FUCK OUT OF THE CAR!\u201D  Panicked I looked out of the\
  \ window - we were at my requested destination, Cork\u2019s Youth Hostel, but the\
  \ car did not stop.  Traumatised I grabbed my backpack, opened the door to the moving\
  \ vehicle and leapt out.\n\nWith the car slowed to about 10kmph, I was able to dive\
  \ out safely intact \u2013 stirred but definitely shaken.  It wasn\u2019t until\
  \ some years later I discovered that convicted serial killers Fred and Rose West\
  \ had been traversing County Cork at the exact same time of my travels. Did falling\
  \ asleep save me from Britain\u2019s most notorious serial killers?"
