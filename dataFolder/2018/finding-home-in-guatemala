Text: "The last thing I expected was my quick two-week trip to Guatemala to turn into\
  \ a four-month long struggle.  I realized something was terribly wrong partway through\
  \ the ride to Quetzaltenango.  I arrived at my Spanish school Sol Latino, in tears.\
  \ The kindness that I experienced in Xela is something I will never forget.  I would\
  \ stubbornly struggle to cook a communal feast for my roomates, while they helped\
  \ with the grocery shopping and washing up.  My instructor Claudia was one of the\
  \ most selfless people I have ever met. As my condition worsened in the coming days,\
  \ she helped me find a traumatologist.  Dr. Rosemary noticed that something was\
  \ very wrong and ordered the necessary tests.   My diagnosis changed my life forever.\
  \  I was unable to travel home for an undetermined amount of time.  I was determined\
  \ to experience Guatemala, even though I was not strong enough to visit the typical\
  \ tourist trail destinations.  Every weekend, I strapped on my back brace and hopped\
  \ on a chicken bus to explore the surrounding highlands, archeological sites and\
  \ Turicentros.   The often-overlooked road to Retalhuleu leads to all these attractions\
  \ and is worthy of days of exploration.  Reu, as it is known locally, offers a tropical\
  \ reprieve from the cool, mountain air of Xela.  Beautiful turicentros, hotels that\
  \ allow entry to their relaxing, often empty swimming pools for only the cost of\
  \ fifteen quetzales. Xocomil is a great experience for anyone craving a waterpark\
  \ adventure.  Located about halfway from Xela on the highway towards Retalhuleu,\
  \ along with it sister park Xetulul is a great way to experience the tropics, within\
  \ the highlands.  A bit further, the Olmec/Maya influenced ruins of Takalik Abaj\
  \ are a worthy day trip.  Momostenango offers interesting tours into the wool dying\
  \ industry, while San Juan\u2019s market is a delight to get lost in and shop for\
  \ traditional huipils, spices and fruit.  Salcaj\xE1 offers lessons in textiles,\
  \ a taste of traditional liquor, caldo de frutas and the oldest colonial church\
  \ in Central America, Ermita de Concepci\xF3n.  San Andr\xE9s Xecul with its stunning\
  \ colourful church is also worth a trip.  A walk up the hill, leads to traditional\
  \ Maya ceremonial sites that can be observed from a distance.  It was time to go\
  \ home, my doctor informed me. Although I was not healed, I was finally strong enough\
  \ to travel.   I could not hold back the tears ago the bus pulled away.  I was leaving\
  \ my home, a place that had come to mean the world to me."
