Text: "It wasn't the religious aspect that made me take on such an epic walk, but\
  \ the absence of belief in anything at all.\nIt was day 11 of a 39 day trek across\
  \ Spain and I don't think there was a single part of me that didn't ache. \nThe\
  \ Spanish landscape spread out before me. Acres and acres of open land, with chunks\
  \ of grapevines, clustered together like herds of animals. A mountain range could\
  \ be seen, far off to my right. I had climbed over that a few days earlier and was\
  \ really feeling the effects of it on my unfit 46 year old body today. \nIt is raining\
  \ on the Camino and I have 2 healing blisters on each foot, making walking difficult.\
  \ \"Come on St James\u2026I really need you now. Please don\u2019t make it rain\
  \ on me and my sore feet\", I mantra over and over. There is a long way to go until\
  \ I can rest and I'm looking for some sort of sign of divine help. I'm down to my\
  \ last shred of will. 'The Camino will provide', they say. So, I again ask St James\
  \ to keep the rain off me. For the next hour I see no-one. I am alone with the thoughts\
  \ in my head and the Camino Path at my feet. I repeat my mantra, to keep me moving\
  \ forward and frankly to keep my mind off the pain in my feet. I\u2019m wondering\
  \ if I will ever experience this trail without pain actually. When one is faced\
  \ with an endless struggle, that\u2019s when it\u2019s said you turn to a higher\
  \ power for help and I think, I'm at that point. \nJust then, up ahead, I notice\
  \ a van idling beside the track. I shuffle up slowly beside it and there is a man\
  \ standing there, resembling Father Christmas, helping someone into the waiting\
  \ vehicle. He looks at me and I jokingly say \u201CMe too!\u201D to the Father Christmas.\n\
  \u201CYou want a lift?\u201D he asks me, raising his eyebrows. I shake my head and\
  \ smile \u201COh no, I\u2019m only joking\u201D and I turn to go. \n\u201CSi, Peregrino,\
  \ I can take you somewhere! Where do you want to go? It\u2019s raining bad, I take\
  \ you\" he insists, his face beaming, arms open. I can\u2019t believe my luck. We\
  \ really are, in the middle of nowhere. I only take a second to assess the situation\
  \ and decide its going to be safe, so I hop in.\n\u201CIf you could take me to Santo-Domingo,\
  \ that would be wonderful, Gracias!\u201D I sigh with relief at sitting down and\
  \ being off my feet. The man refuses any money from me as he drives me on. I think\
  \ I love Spain.\nThe hairs on my arms spring up at the dawning realisation that,\
  \ I think I have just experienced a miracle. \nHe was listening. \nSt James heard\
  \ me. \nI look out the window. \nSpain becomes all the colours of the rainbow."
