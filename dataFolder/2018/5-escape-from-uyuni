Text: "Bolivia is a fascinatingly unpredictable country with a penchant for protest.\
  \ I learnt this while, travelling from La Paz to Uyuni, the muster point for the\
  \ famed Salar de Uyuni jeep tours.  \n\nI found myself standing in the fresh morning\
  \ sun, blearily eyeing up an assortment of rusty barrels and old plastic buckets\
  \ sitting on the road. Haphazardly traversing these was what looked like homemade\
  \ barbed wire and frayed bailing twine, and behind that was a group of campesinos\
  \ ambivalently brandishing lengths of two-by-four. I later learnt this \u2018barricade\u2019\
  \ was part of a protest for a larger bus station. Its enforcers, I sensed, were\
  \ there in spirit more than anything else. Our bus driver, careful not to show visible\
  \ delight at the prospect of an early return to La Paz, assumed a pivotal role in\
  \ unloading the bus, wantonly slinging baggage into the arms of perplexed backpackers.\
  \ A few helpful gestures from the barricades, and my fellow ex-passengers and I\
  \ were trudging the mile or so into town.\n\nUyuni itself is an intriguing place.\
  \ With barely a handful of buildings over two-storeys, it resembles a windswept\
  \ frontier town that time forgot, existing, it seemed, solely to provision the herds\
  \ of tourists that pass through every three days en route to the hallowed salt flats.\
  \  \n\nHaving now missed my own tour thanks to the bus mutiny, I resolved to negotiate\
  \ my way out of \u2018Dodge\u2019 the following day.  \n\nAs the Bolivian sun rose\
  \ again good fortune arrived in the shape of Walter and his Landcruiser. Unsure\
  \ what I had agreed to, having hastily organised my transport with Walter\u2019\
  s wife in shaky schoolboy Spanish, I was reassured as four more unlikely looking\
  \ adventurers emerged to claim their seats. Esteban, a leathery Murcian, rode shotgun,\
  \ while I, alongside two charming Madrile\xF1as, Luisa and Camila, formed the central\
  \ trio. Behind us was Kai, an enigmatic but actually quite unintelligible young\
  \ Korean chap who spoke neither English nor Spanish proficiently.\n\nComplete with\
  \ language barrier in tow, our posse set out across the plains.\n\nThe following\
  \ two days, which began with a degree of trepidation, were one of the least expected\
  \ but most enjoyable trips I\u2019ve ever taken. As it turned out, Esteban was a\
  \ keen fan of The Pogues, and so we ragged around the Atacama desert by day listening\
  \ to Celtic punk rock, and spent our last night in Bolivia in a remote bothy slurping\
  \ traditional Locro de Gallina by candlelight, making good use of that unique humour\
  \ found only in the company of new international friends."
