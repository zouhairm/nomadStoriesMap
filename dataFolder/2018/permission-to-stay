Text: "I nervously glanced at the red number displayed on the wall of the local police\
  \ headquarters, yet the digits refused to move. It would still be some time before\
  \ I could present my documents and application to legally remain in a country far\
  \ from my own. Surveying hundreds of other people squeezed into the cold room, I\
  \ noticed mothers with colorful head wraps nursing babies, pacing fathers with furrowed\
  \ brows pulling on their moustaches, and children creating games out of the broken\
  \ chair arms to pass the time. Most of all I listened to the barrage of chatter\
  \ \u2013 rarely did two languages match. Each of us was hoping for the stamp of\
  \ approval on our documents: permission to stay, permission to belong. \n\nThe young\
  \ woman with dark eyes across the aisle kept looking at me, taking me in. Even among\
  \ all the variety in the room, I stood out. The rough material of my grey skirt\
  \ scratched my knees as I shuffled one foot over the other. She seemed too young\
  \ to be a mother, yet she had two little ones with endless curls running around\
  \ as she tried to calm them, and a wrapped bundle pressed to her breast. Exasperated,\
  \ she looked at who must have been the father, but he was too preoccupied tracing\
  \ and retracing his steps on the floor. Tentatively I pulled out some crackers and\
  \ looked at her questioningly, indicating the children. She returned my gaze with\
  \ one both wary and relieved. Though unable to speak with each other, the time somehow\
  \ passed more quickly as we gestured to each other about her children, the lines\
  \ in front of the windows, and the chilly air. When my number pinged on the display,\
  \ I was rewarded with a small smile as I walked away.\n\nI looked for her often\
  \ as I walked the cobblestone streets of that city. On the bus or swaying in the\
  \ tram, I found myself searching for those eyes accompanied by two mops of curls.\
  \ Instead I found myself talking to men with weather-beaten faces, women who had\
  \ pictures of their children hanging around their necks, and parents herding kids\
  \ with backpacks - their young charges speaking this foreign language much better\
  \ than I. Gradually the sights and smells began to feel familiar, and my tongue\
  \ hesitated less and less as I made the once-strange sounds.\n \nFifteen months\
  \ later, I pulled a heavy suitcase as I stepped onto the train to start my return\
  \ journey. Through the window, those dark eyes slipped past me as we rolled forward.\
  \ I smiled at her blurred image as I left, unsure if I was going home or leaving\
  \ it behind."
