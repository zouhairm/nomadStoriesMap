Text: "The last thing I expected was that a green football field would make me cry.\
  \ \n\nBefore taking off on this journey, I had expected to be a little afraid, and\
  \ during the first night here, standing alone in my three beds\u2019 hotel room\
  \ staring out the window into the dark night, I did feel immensely small. Distant\
  \ dots of light revealed the contours of a landscape unfamiliar to anything I had\
  \ ever seen before.\n\n\u2018I am so far away from home,\u2019 I thought and, overwhelmed,\
  \ I pulled the curtains together \u2013 tightly, no cranny to let in the unfamiliar.\
  \ \n\nI didn\u2019t sleep for long; the beat of Bethlehem\u2019s morning rhythm\
  \ is hard to overhear. It begins with singing (on good days, bad days \u2013 it\
  \ sounds more like yelling) from the mosques' minarets. After the Morning Prayer,\
  \ you hear the first rumbles of shopping carts being pushed or pulled through the\
  \ bumpy streets of the old bazaar. Metal creaking from shops being opened.  A little\
  \ later, the church bells will sing over the roof tops, a donkey tied with a rope\
  \ outside a small coffee shop will answer, and there you are, in the middle of it\
  \ all.\n\nAnd there I was, puzzled by pretty much everything. It had been more than\
  \ three years since The Second Intifada had ended and yet I was somehow (happily!)\
  \ surprised that the only blood dripping in the streets was from the newly slaughtered\
  \ sheep at the butchers\u2019 stalls. \n\nI was surprised when we visited a suburb\
  \ in the outskirts of Bethlehem and this suburb of tall concrete buildings and shops\
  \ and daycare centers was not really a suburb, but a refugee camp. And I was surprised\
  \ when one of its residents, on old lady with furrowed skin \u2013 oh, the stories\
  \ hidden in those lines! \u2013 invited us in for tea; she had nothing and yet something\
  \ to give.\n\nAfter two weeks of mint tea and weird sugar-sticky cheesy cakes, of\
  \ two weeks of constant sweating, of visits to numerous churches, several mosques\
  \ and one Bat Mitzvah, of stories and jokes and food being shared on both sides\
  \ of the concrete wall, this is what makes me cry: \n\nA group of children chasing\
  \ a ball, a tool of childhood and a symbol of making it, on a green field of grass\
  \ in the driest of landscapes."
