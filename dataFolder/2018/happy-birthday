Text: "Feb 23, 2018. I turned 37. It is definitely a memorable birthday.\nFew years\
  \ ago Eduardo and I were talking about Lavamatica Campestre, and how much I loved\
  \ doing the laundry there, I joked about having my birthday party with a beer while\
  \ washing my clothes and everyone would be invited.\n\nEduardo is not with us anymore\
  \ and sadly, Lavamatica Campestre won\u2019t be either in a few days.\nI don\u2019\
  t know how many people spent a birthday washing clothes there, but I\u2019m glad\
  \ that I had the chance to \u2018celebrate\u2019 this birthday there. It wasn\u2019\
  t the huge party with Heinekens that I dreamed about, but a very special one, visiting\
  \ with my son, who now enjoyed playing with the new ruins of the place.\n\nA friend\
  \ told me once that living in Buenos Aires was like living in the 60\u2019s. Time\
  \ preserved perfectly entire neighborhoods with the same families, businesses, architecture\
  \ and essence. After his stay in Argentina he returned to Mexico City, leaving new\
  \ family in Buenos Aires. \n\u201CIt was hard leaving the 60\u2019s and getting\
  \ back to the future.\u201D \n\nI found my 60\u2019s in Tijuana, in a real vintage\
  \ Laundry Place that preserved to the very last day its magnificent and innovating\
  \ architecture; eco wise designed in every functional detail, beautifully decorated\
  \ with its original furniture and equipment from the late 60\u2019s.\nThere, in\
  \ my 60\u2019s, I lived many important experiences in my life. It was a second home\
  \ to me for quite a while, happily  washing, drying, folding clothes. Having coffee\
  \ and noodles for dinner in a stunning old place, yet very warm and familiar. So\
  \ sixties, so Tijuana. Pure history. \nIt was the visionary idea of Mr. Leopoldo\
  \ Vazquez of making a successful, ethical business to last forever. He built it\
  \ that way, perfect from the inside out.  After 45 years of service Lavamatica Campestre\
  \ closed their doors forever.\n\nEvery single time I went I fantasized the idea\
  \ that it would\u2019ve renovated and updated their equipment and eco technologies\
  \ like solar panels, etc., but keeping the fascinating, vintage original charm of\
  \ the place. To continue with the great example of success and community service.\
  \  They always had (and still have) an enormous potential, but the future of this\
  \ place will be very different. Most likely it will be demolished and built on top\
  \ another \u2018high luxury\u2019 apartment building with many empty apartments,\
  \ like so many others in this city. \n\nI never thought that getting back to the\
  \ future would\u2019ve be so hard.\n\nHappy 37, Flores!"
