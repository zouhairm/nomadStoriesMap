Text: "I bought a sleeping bag, hopped on a night bus with a group of strangers and\
  \ started an eight-hour journey to the Mystical Oasis of Siwah. We headed North\
  \ West into the Egyptian Western Desert looking for the isolated paradise lying\
  \ between the Qattara Depression and the Egyptian Sand Sea . \nFurther into the\
  \ desert, you start losing parts of our modern world. You lose connectivity and\
  \ it becomes only you, group of travelers and the desert. As your eyes start to\
  \ adjust to the different shades of yellow, the sand sea, the desert, suddenly you\
  \ see a paradise of palm trees, appearing in the middle of nowhere. \n This oasis\
  \ has been isolated for centuries and hence maintained its heritage and preserved\
  \ its customs and traditions. Inhabitants master the Siwi language as their mother\
  \ tongue. Olives, Dates and Spring Water are the pillars of their economy. We started\
  \ by exploring the oasis in an attempt to find the hidden gems and following the\
  \ path of Alexander the Great to get revelations on our destined paths. \nTurquoise\
  \ salt lakes bursting in color hidden with the desert. I could not resist the beauty\
  \ of it, and I jumped. The literate definition of floating, you give in to the force\
  \ and just float.  \u201CEin Wahed\u201D was our second stop, which means Spring\
  \ 1, which is the first hot water spring discovered mistakenly in their search for\
  \ oil. One man\u2019s loss is another man\u2019s treasure. For the second time,\
  \ I Jumped. The warm water relaxes every muscle in your body; nature presented a\
  \ hot bath for cold nights in the desert. \nAs we watched the sun setting over the\
  \ sand dunes, and desert surrounding us from all directions with no forms of civilization,\
  \ I sensed a feeling of greatness. The sky was literally the limit and luckily,\
  \ without the moon, the stars were shining like never before. Everything was so\
  \ quiet, majestic and time seemed to stop. As I was gazing at the starts, I realized\
  \ that this was it. I did not need to find answers from the oracles of Ammoun, the\
  \ answer lied within me, and what I wanted to do with my life.\nI always had excuses\
  \ not to follow my dreams, and they were all echoes of fear. The fear of listening\
  \ to my inner voice trying to burst out. In Siwah, I lived several days of the grid\
  \ and I survived. I meet new people from different walks of life, saw things I have\
  \ never seen and pushed by endurance levels .The good thing is not that I just did\
  \ it, I did it happily and peacefully. I guess Siwah is really about finding your\
  \ destined paths."
