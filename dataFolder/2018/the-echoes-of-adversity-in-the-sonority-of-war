Text: "Hitchhiking through the rugged mountains of Lebanon, on route to the shorefront\
  \ of the city of Sidon, an old Volkswagen transporter hauling goats stopped to my\
  \ patient, yet desperate signalling. Greeted by a toothless, white-bearded elder\
  \ named Atif, I offered a few USDs to compensate for any inconveniences; he accepted\
  \ and blessed me for the gesture, as if he were more desperate than I. I hopped\
  \ into the pickup next to Atif, and we made our way down the curvy, narrow mountain\
  \ side to Beirut. As we approached the city, we encountered a military checkpoint,\
  \ a frequent occurrence in Lebanon's hotspots or conflict zones. Puttering along,\
  \ Atif stated to the guard, \u201Caateek el yafie\u201D, translated as, 'may God\
  \ give you strength to carry on.' The guard bleakly nodded as if he had heard such\
  \ a statement many times throughout the scorching hot and humid day. The closer\
  \ we approached the Mediterranean Sea, the stickier I felt, as if my back and arms\
  \ were glued to the cracking leather seat. Within moments of merging onto a freeway,\
  \ I felt anxious as the 4-lane highway became overcrowded by reckless drivers who\
  \ forced two new precarious lanes. Driving at inconsistent speeds, Atif and I drooped\
  \ our limbs out the window seeking to catch a gust of wind, as the AC effused musty,\
  \ warm air. The further south we travelled, the cleaner and bluer the water became,\
  \ while the number of private resorts drastically declined. Once arriving in Sidon,\
  \ the prevalence of security checkpoints heightened, many of which were surrounded\
  \ by cement high-rises riddled with bullet holes and a concentration of poverty.\
  \ When I reached my destination, I thanked Atif for his kindness, stating my farewell.\
  \ I began my trek through the field of molten-like granules of sand to the majestic\
  \ shorefront; captivated by the crashing waves, I paused for a moment in stillness\
  \ and awe, being sprayed by the debris of the sea with the sun\u2019s rays beaming\
  \ down on me. I stripped down to my shorts to go for a swim in the warm, buoyant\
  \ body of water. 10 minutes into my swim chaos erupted, as automatic weapons began\
  \ going off, with the sound of bullets tearing through the sky. I frantically sought\
  \ out cover behind an alga incrusted rock at the water's edge. Suddenly, the bedlam\
  \ ended as abruptly as it began. This moment of unrest signified the stark essence\
  \ of Lebanese culture, wherein people appreciate and espouse every moment of life,\
  \ even in the direst and most unsettling realities of war and violence."
