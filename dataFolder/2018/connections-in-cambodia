Text: "In the morning, you can still smell from the night before, spicy papaya and\
  \ sweet roasting satay looming in the air. It is dark and without the sun, there\
  \ is no light to see your path in the jungles of Cambodia. \n\nChenda, my remorque\
  \ driver (\u2018Tuk Tuk\u2019) assures me that we will arrive in time for sunrise.\
  \ Driving through streets stained with rich red soil, we make small talk as we head\
  \ towards the temples. \n\nAt first, Chenda didn\u2019t like me. \n\nMost tourists,\
  \ he explained, treat the local people as slaves and there is little recourse for\
  \ the locals when they are jilted. Many tourists will walk away without paying their\
  \ bills. He was worried at first I would be like the others, but he can tell now\
  \ that I am \u2018good people.'\n\nThere is a tremendous disparity in the lives\
  \ of most Cambodians, and the lives of the few ultra wealthy and powerful. He tells\
  \ me more about the trials and tribulations of a country just barely reclaiming\
  \ their former glory after horrendous wars, genocide and economic strife. \n\nLight\
  \ heartedly, I offer an interesting story I had read recently about a drunk Chinese\
  \ woman in Singapore who had been caught for evading and abusing her taxi driver,\
  \ which is illegal in Singapore (in addition to being morally corrupt, imo). Chenda\
  \ agreed it would be better if Cambodia were more like Singapore.\n\nI assure him\
  \ that while Singapore is nice, it is no Cambodia. \n\nHe agrees. There will always\
  \ only be one Cambodia, and he is proud to be Khmer.\n\nI can see why.\n\nWhen we\
  \ arrived, it seemed like the sun was greeting the entire temple with a warm hug.\
  \ Sunlight burst through corridors, creating geometric shadows and lighting up the\
  \ faces of Buddha and Vishnu. \n\nChenda elaborated on the former glory, detailing\
  \ the real and the mystical histories of the Apsara\u2019s, the Angkorian Warriors\
  \ and Kings of great importance, such as Jayavarman. Making connections to the past\
  \ and present, I get lost in the stories he tells. \n\nCompletely entranced by the\
  \ images in my mind of walls covered in gold, adorned with rubies and precious stones.\
  \ Visions of Apsara dancers telling stories through their otherworldly movements\
  \ and set in a backdrop saturated by the sun and reflecting in gold. \n\nYou can\
  \ still hear monks chanting in the near distance. \n\nI am thankful to have met\
  \ Chenda.\n\nThere is something connecting us now.\n\nHonoring the history of those\
  \ who came before; I am humbled to remember there will be many more, long after\
  \ I am gone. \n\nBut Cambodia, Cambodia is infinite."
