Text: "Her words played in my head as I looked through the clouded window and into\
  \ the misty abyss. When we\u2019d left that morning it hadn\u2019t been snowing,\
  \ but now, as the sun had started to set, a thin layer of sleet was beginning to\
  \ cover the ground. Outside the wind had started to pick up, howling eerily as it\
  \ passed over us. This typically idyllic setting was now more reminiscent of a childhood\
  \ nightmare. Scandinavia\u2019s Copacabana was beginning to awaken the residents\
  \ of coastal Malm\xF6.\n \nBeads of sweat ran down my face and onto the damp towel\
  \ beneath me. With every shallow breath I could taste the smoke rising from the\
  \ smoldering coals in front of us. The trick, I read, is to embrace the heat. Let\
  \ it wash over you as if it were cleansing you from the inside out. I could feel\
  \ my heart beating furiously against my chest, like it was trying to push the toxins\
  \ out through my enlarged pores. Surprisingly, the prolonged exposure to the heat\
  \ seemed to be producing a valium-like effect within my mind. Who\u2019d have thought\
  \ this ancient Nordic tradition could challenge the views of modern medicine? \n\
  \nA warm hand on my arm interrupted my thoughts. To my left I saw her freckled face\
  \ glistening in the dimly lit room. My friend\u2019s glazed eyes spoke the words\
  \ I\u2019d been too scared to say.\n \nIt was our turn to take the plunge. \n\n\
  I felt the drops of melting snow hit me as soon as we stepped outside. Like iced\
  \ daggers, they pierced my naked skin. Ignoring the pain, we followed the path around\
  \ the building until we found ourselves staring into the bottomless pits before\
  \ us. With a running start she dove, head first into the perils of the Swedish sea.\
  \ I watched, slightly horrified as the water lapped hungrily at the pillars, as\
  \ if awaiting its next meal. Could I really do it? My consciousness was telling\
  \ me to turn around and run back to the warmth, yet my body defied any rationality\
  \ I once had. I stayed frozen in place, but not on account of the temperature. \n\
  \nHer soft voice piped up in the back of my mind, reminding me of our earlier discussion.\
  \ \u201CDon\u2019t hesitate, just jump,\u201D my friend responded when I\u2019d\
  \ asked for advice. Not exactly the encouragement I anticipated, but she had a point.\
  \ I needed to let myself go from the fears that were holding me back. To break free\
  \ from the prison within my mind and embrace the demons that lay before me. With\
  \ a final look out across the horizon, I closed my eyes and ignored my better judgment.\n\
  \nI jumped."
