Text: "In Lake Atitlan, Guatemala, a tarot reader will tell you your future, for a\
  \ price of course. She told me to take care as I was going to be mentally and emotionally\
  \ pushed to the limit. Little did I know how right she would be.\n\nThe very next\
  \ Sunday, I found myself huffing and puffing up Acatenango Volcano in Guatemala.\
  \ My thighs were on fire and my lungs were about to explode. The path had a steady\
  \ incline with twists and turns. I had started on dirt paths through cornfields\
  \ and forested areas and then moved to loose gravel. The views were breathtaking\
  \ but I was too busy cursing my sedentary lifestyle to really appreciate them. \n\
  \nHere I was, one hand pulling me up, grabbing anything that looked strong enough\
  \ to support my weight \u2013 low hanging tree branches, the bit of fence that separated\
  \ the path up the Volcano and someone\u2019s property \u2013 anything. The other\
  \ hand tightly grasped the walking stick I had rented at the starting point. I should\
  \ have got two. You live and learn. I was taking 10 steps then resting for 5 seconds.\
  \ Advice I\u2019d been given by a guide. I think he could see me having a mental\
  \ breakdown as I struggled up. My thighs were on fire and I just wanted to lie down\
  \ in a foetal position and cry. I had to keep going. Mama didn\u2019t raise a quitter,\
  \ although she nearly did. \n\nMy normally independent self agreed to let one of\
  \ the guys in my group carry my 3L bottle of water. My pride was too tired to care.\
  \ \n\nFinally we arrived at campsite, 3500m up. I nearly cried from sheer happiness.\
  \ I was ready to watch Volcan de Fuego erupt. The whole reason I had suffered for\
  \ 4 hours, yes that\u2019s right, only 4 hours. The loud grumbles and explosive\
  \ bangs, as well as the sight of the lava shooting up the air and running down the\
  \ sides of the volcano, an orange glow against the dark background of the night\
  \ sky, made me forget the pain I had endured, but not my legs. They remembered.\
  \ \n\n\u201CThe Halo Effect\u201D is when the joy and relief of having delivered\
  \ a healthy baby and the bond created the moment a mother holds a child for the\
  \ first time colours the memory of the preceding pain. I must have a lesser version\
  \ of that. It must be the reason why I keep doing these leg killing activities,\
  \ the joy of completing the activity and being rewarded with amazing views makes\
  \ me forget I was cursing myself . Or it could be my severe case of FOMO (Fear of\
  \ Missing Out). \n\nNow my FOMO and I are looking for a therapist to help me get\
  \ over this trauma."
