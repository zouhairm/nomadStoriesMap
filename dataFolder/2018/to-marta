Text: "Checked my phone and it\u2019s 10:45 am, surprisingly I\u2019ve arrived at\
  \ the train station 45 minutes before my train leaves. Unfortunately, I did not\
  \ inherit my dad\u2019s Swiss punctuality. Grabbed a coffee and followed my way\
  \ to the platform. \u201CDo you need any help?\u201D a man asked me as he sees me\
  \ struggle with my bulky bags. We sat down on the nearest bench as we talked about\
  \ the reasons that brought us to the same railway station on a rainy day in Edinburgh.\n\
  \nHis name is Samuel, he was born in Ghana and just recently won a scholarship to\
  \ study engineering in the UK so it's his first time abroad. \n\u201CAre you nervous?\u201D\
  \ I asked. \u201CMore than ever\u201D he responded. I recognized the fear in his\
  \ eyes. I\u2019ve had it before. \n\nIt was 2015 and I had just dropped my very\
  \ meticulous plans to be part of a volunteering program in Sokolka, Poland. I figured\
  \ if I was gonna change my life I should do it drastically. As I was waiting at\
  \ the bus stop for a stranger to pick me up, I started to think about all the decisions\
  \ that have taken me to that precise moment. I questioned them all. Fear and anxiety\
  \ were running through my body.\n\nWhile drowned in my thoughts I heard my name\
  \ called from the distance. A woman approached me as I turned. \u201CNatalia, I\u2019\
  m so happy to finally meet you\u201D she said. We happily hugged.\n\nWe arrived\
  \ at the house and everyone was waiting for me. They barely spoke any English but\
  \ words are not that necessary when you communicate with emotions. I smelled the\
  \ homemade food and somehow the whole scene reminded me of a typical Saturday afternoon\
  \ at my grandparent\u2019s house back at home.We sat down at the table as I was\
  \ getting to know everyone. I couldn't help but notice there was a big map of Latin\
  \ America laying down next to the table with El Salvador circled in red. I smiled.\
  \ Somehow I was not scared anymore. I felt at home. \n\nSamuel smiled throughout\
  \ the story. I told him fear is unavoidable but that embracing uncertainty was the\
  \ best decision I ever made and that it\u2019s all worth it at the end.\n\n\u201C\
  Have you seen her again, the woman who picked you up?\u201D He asked.\n\nI told\
  \ him I haven\u2019t. Not since I said goodbye of her on the same bus stop where\
  \ met for the first time, but I\u2019ve met a lot of people like her, people who\
  \ brought home to me in the most remote parts of the world.\n\nIt\u2019s 11:27 and\
  \ I see my train approaching. I grab my bags and I said goodbye to him as I leave.\
  \ Samuel runs rapidly towards me and says to me \u201Cone more thing, what was her\
  \ name?\u201D\n\n\u201CMarta\u201D I said as I smiled."
