Text: "I am from a small concrete jungle city called Singapore. Came to New Zealand\
  \ on a working holiday visa and decided to try hitch hiking to travel around as\
  \ I did not have a driving license (in Singapore cars are super expensive and everywhere\
  \ is easily accessible by public transport). \n\nI remember the very first time\
  \ I placed my thumb up 30 cars drove past me, some of them even horned at me. The\
  \ 31st car that drove past decided to stop by the bend, I ran with joy to the car\
  \ and asked where was he going. His destination was different from where I was intending\
  \ to go, but I decided to follow him as I was standing by the road for too long.\
  \ \nI did not like being rejected and being rejected by 30 cars was tough for me\
  \ to swallowed.\nThe first question I asked him was \"why do people horn at me while\
  \ I have my thumb up?\" He explained that some do so to say sorry that they couldn't\
  \ pick me up and some do so just to be funny (which to me they aint funny at all).\
  \ He say that I should stay positive and not overthink the meaning of the horn.\
  \ \nBack home (in Singapore), we only horn at people when they are in the wrong\
  \ of way or when they are not moving off during the green light or when they are\
  \ in the way of traffic. It is only natural for me to think negatively instead.\
  \ \n\nWe chatted about the town where he stayed, he even opened up his house for\
  \ me to stay the night and cooked dinner for me and his family. They are the first\
  \ kiwi family that I met and stayed with.\nDuring dinner, we exchanged our views\
  \ on the culture differences, political views about our country and the depth of\
  \ our dinner chat was just so amazing. I learnt so much about new zealand from staying\
  \ and speaking to one local family. \nNever have I thought in my wildest dream that\
  \ I would be able to find a kiwi family whom would treats me as their own. We exchanged\
  \ contacts and he even drove me (out of his usual route) to the town I wanted to\
  \ visit the next morning.\n\nThis feeling of home and the kiwi friendliness was\
  \ my biggest takeback from my whole trip in new zealand. Every now and then, my\
  \ kiwi family would check on me and ask how am I coping in a foreign land alone.\
  \ \nSince then, I never once left alone in this country and hitch hiking became\
  \ habitual for me. I learnt to take rejections lighter and look forward to meet\
  \ and learn from more people everyday. \n\nNever regretted doing this working holiday\
  \ SOLO and taking bold steps out of my comfort zone, challenging myself daily.\n\
  \nThumbs up PRIS, you did well"
