Text: "Oppositely to Latin countries, stray dogs do not teem in the Baltic States.\
  \ Cold weather is of course a determining condition for this fact. So they either\
  \ live in a shelter hoping for an adoptive family, or they already have a human\
  \ companion.\nWhile living in Latvia for a year, I was getting used to the lack\
  \ of random interactions with dogs who take the initiative, until one night that\
  \ I was sitting by the window of a trashy, local, famous, cheap bar in Riga and\
  \ out of the blue I felt a humid, hairy, warm breath on the back of my left hand.\
  \ \nA small creature with pointy ears and wandering gaze was there. I instantly\
  \ loved her and slowly we engaged into a spellbound exchange of funny and gruff\
  \ jiggery \u2013 pokery, which escalated to me not caring about the surroundings\
  \ and using a very ridiculous voice tone to tell her repeatedly:\n\n- You don\u2019\
  t have a nose, you flat, pug, and non existent-nose. \n\nAs for her, it took place\
  \ as biting my hands, soaking them in extra stinky saliva and making pig noises.\
  \ \nWe were very happy. And after some minutes of this, her human came over to us\
  \ from the other side of the bar, with a leash on his hands. \nAt first I thought\
  \ she would be in trouble, but instead, she was encouraged to keep chilling with\
  \ me by this guy, who also decided to tell me the story of the creature; her name:\
  \ Madame Zuzu.\n\n- She belongs to my sister, who leads a \u201Cnormal\u201D life\
  \ - he said, quoting with his fingers the normal part. \nAnd then continued with\
  \ the tale:\n\n- With my sister she has comfort, and safety, good food, a place\
  \ to nap, routine. But sometimes she is out of town and I take care of Madame Zuzu.\
  \ She spends some days with me, and I take her everywhere I go. \n\nI nodded in\
  \ silence, listening, observing, and still playing with the smelly creature.\nThe\
  \ guy got thoughtful, and continued with his train of reasoning by saying out loud:\
  \ \n\n- I think she is very lucky, because she gets to have a double life. Two lives\
  \ that are right for her: the organized one and the adventurous one. She has two\
  \ gods, and two lives. One for each, and each as good as the other one. \nIs not\
  \ like for humans, you see?, we usually have a god and a devil, and we struggle\
  \ with our double lives - he finished saying and our eyes met for an instant.\n\n\
  It is impossible to know for sure, but I\u2019m quite certain at that moment we\
  \ both realized about the strength of his idea, and the power of his words.\nI smiled,\
  \ and they went on with their double life, and so I went on with mine."
