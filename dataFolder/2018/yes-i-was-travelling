Text: "Yes, I was travelling alone. And that was my first time. I was exciting and\
  \ sad at the same time: does someone know something more intimate than travelling\
  \ alone? And more, is it good to share it with nobody else except from you? I was\
  \ wondering while walking in the city centre. Prague is picturesque. The weather\
  \ was perfect, sunny and warm enough, and the sky was blue.\nWhy was I there? In\
  \ a few words, I decided to break the bonds which linked me with my hometown and\
  \ I started travelling alone. I was in Spain with my boyfriend when I realized I\
  \ never went somewhere alone. Our lives are busy, we always do more than we really\
  \ need, we lose precious time and we skip adventures. But what\u2019s really an\
  \ adventure? Everybody knows his own limits, but can you go beyond them? \nThe sun\
  \ was high in the blue sky and people were vociferating. I was strolling in the\
  \ city centre with a clear destination. I was enjoying the way more than the expectation\
  \ of my destination: that was travelling. I realized I was travelling: cause who\
  \ really knows what does travelling mean? Are you really travelling when you think\
  \ to thousands things? You are absorbed by other matters, so you don\u2019t really\
  \ focus on your path. Maybe we should have few breaks from time to time in order\
  \ to know ourselves better, and to discover lot of things. Things about you, about\
  \ the world, and not only about who and when the king built that castle. That is,\
  \ my local connection was on: the connection with the city, with the soil, with\
  \ myself too. And the connection begun itself, I could not realize when and how\
  \ exactly. That is amazing. \nI reached the castle, cradled by many thoughts and\
  \ reflections: then I walked around, I enjoyed the view, I took pictures of people\
  \ and situations, and I bought a postcard of the castle and its wall. I mean, taking\
  \ pictures of monuments is not significant at all: you can look at them whenever\
  \ you want, by searching it on the web, but you cannot live again the atmosphere\
  \ you exactly experienced there. The queue in front of the entrance, the sky and\
  \ its colour. A girl was nursing her son, a child was drinking a juice, a family\
  \ was reading a guidebook, and I was living. \nIn a few days I would be home again,\
  \ focused on the various things we are always asked to care. I called my boyfriend\
  \ to hear his voice: it was like if I was on a different planet. \nAnd now here\
  \ I am, watching again and again to the pictures I took during that trip and feeling\
  \ again the heat of the land around me."
