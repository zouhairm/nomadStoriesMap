Text: "\"Come on, just a little higher.\" Our local host, Olessia, read my distressed\
  \ face. Her father had been generous with his homemade vodka the night before and\
  \ I had been pleased then. This sunny morning I wasn\u2019t pleased as we trudged\
  \ up the Caucasus, dehydrated, in search of an elusive spring. \n\nTwo hours later,\
  \ we were finally near the Holy Grail, staring down the barrels of three AK-47s.\
  \ North Ossetia-Alania, Indian visa authorities had warned us, was a troubled Russian\
  \ republic. And until we landed there, we hadn\u2019t even heard of its capital\
  \ city, Vladikavkaz. \n\nNow, before us, were fatigue-clad agents of the FSB, the\
  \ erstwhile KGB. No, we were not being detained, but, no, we couldn\u2019t leave.\
  \ An insurgency was raging; the Beslan school massacre had occurred nearby, and\
  \ foreigners were under suspicion. Several frantic calls later, we were allowed\
  \ to leave. \n\nBack at Olessia\u2019s home, enjoying some melt-in-the-mouth \u2018\
  pirog\u2019 \u2013 imagine a deep-dish pizza stuffed with cheese and potatoes or\
  \ herbs and meats \u2013 I thought of our less dramatic time in Vladikavkaz. The\
  \ main pedestrian street, Prospekt Mira, flanked by tram tracks, gardens and fountains;\
  \ the quaint little Hotel Alexandria, where the lady at the piano would play a Bollywood\
  \ tune each time she noticed us; and the towering statue of Lenin, still looking\
  \ over a people, many of whom have embraced capitalism.\n\nThat evening we hit the\
  \ local pubs, and walked into another \u2018detention\u2019. As we made ourselves\
  \ busy at the bar, a man walked up to my friend, Elaine, and offered her a drink.\
  \ What started as a trickle became a downpour. Vladikavkaz doesn\u2019t get many\
  \ tourists and the patrons were soon fighting over each other to buy us drinks.\
  \ They convinced us to go to a karaoke bar. A black SUV picked us up. The man behind\
  \ the wheel looked like a mafia don from the movies, but turned out to be a celebrated\
  \ opera singer.\n\nThe bar was deserted when we entered. It was late, most people\
  \ had left, but the two brothers who owned the place were waiting for us, along\
  \ with their staff and some friends. As the music and alcohol flowed, my friend\
  \ Keith sang the first song of his life. A few hours later we decided to leave.\
  \ We were not allowed to pay. \n\nOver the next several days, we toured other cities,\
  \ including Moscow and St Petersburg, but Vladikavkaz remained the highlight of\
  \ our Russian holiday. It is people, we realized, who make a city memorable, not\
  \ just museums, music halls, and insurgencies. And, perhaps, the free booze."
