Text: "Argentina is a breathtaking place to know\u2026Indeed  it\u2019s so captivating,\
  \ it is bustling, it is endless\u2026I mean it is a world you can enjoy in one place!\
  \ In every corner of this vast land there is always something and someone new and\
  \ amazing to discover. Around every corner, there\u2019s a magic moment waiting\
  \ to leave you inspired with its incredible and smiling people underpinning it all.\
  \ From small city life to adventure, wildlife to culture, whale watching in Puerto\
  \ Madryn, fine dining to local cuisine, wines from Mendoza and if you do love food\
  \ like I do, eating out in Ushuaia is a pleasure. There\u2019s something for every\
  \ taste. Whether you are keen on trying out seafood or (el asado), local fare, traditional\
  \ meat and potatoes, fast food with a local twist or world-class designer cuisine,\
  \ it is all there. Eating out is an absolute pleasure and like a religion here,\
  \ especially if you have an adventurous palate. Breathtaking scenery to snow-soaked\
  \ patagonia mountains in winter to Ushuaia the end of the world  and a  gateway\
  \ to Antartica \u2013 there is a lot to discover in Argentina. It has a vibrant\
  \ culture, a melting pot of diverse cultural depth worth exploring\u2026 There is\
  \ more flagship cultural destination for visitors interested in learning more about\
  \ Argentina history, its people and culture for anyone free, open minded and adventurous\
  \ in spirit. So Argentina offers a grand, somewhat offbeat experience to all."
