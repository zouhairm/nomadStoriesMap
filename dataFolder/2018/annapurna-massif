Text: "This is the base of the Annapurna circuit in Nepal. Within the first kilometre,\
  \ our pack of trekkers is surrounded by littered chocolate wrappers of past walkers\
  \ and a pack of five scrounging dogs - rabies probable. \nScenic and spiritual -\
  \ not so probable. \nDogs begin to bark, bite, and brawl between our legs - after\
  \ it dawns on them we have no chocolate to spare or rum to drop down their throats,\
  \ they drop off one by one, slinking back up into the farmlands like foiled cowboys.\n\
  One dog remains; a small, scrappy, Jack Russell. To the disdain of our leader, we\
  \ name her Dobby. \n\u2018It starting with the name!\u2019 she barked. \u2018You\
  \ giving it a name, then you giving it some food, then it sitting at the table,\
  \ then it sleeping on your pillow, then it giving you rabies! You don\u2019t name\
  \ the dog!'\nI soon give up any reasonable resistance to rabies-infested strays\
  \ (and a week later contract a serious stomach infection commonly transmitted by\
  \ dogs). Taking Dobby\u2019s little head in my hands, I begin cleaning her eyes\
  \ with wads of tissue daily, tickling the underside of her chin, and feeding her\
  \ the scraps of my meals. At the homestay she would often be curled up on my pillow;\
  \ I'd shout at her half-heartedly. \nDobby followed us for six days. It was hard\
  \ to believe she had trotted almost a hundred kilometres of alpine terrain in freezing\
  \ conditions simply for scraps of food or a sheltered bed. Each day she had spent\
  \ the seven-hour walk sprinting between us conducting rigorous head counts, or running\
  \ to the last stragglers for company and moral support. She fended off every person\
  \ or creature that tried to cross our path, but knew exactly which human was from\
  \ her own flock and which was not. She secured a spot at the dinner table where\
  \ she sat attentively on her own cushioned chair, always with excellent table manners.\
  \ In the evening she would entertain herself by stealing our smelly socks hung up\
  \ to dry, and slapping them against the ground like a hunted fish. She also secured\
  \ her nightly bed; curled into my pile of hiking clothes, snoring on the floor next\
  \ to me. \n\nWe left her in the Himalayan villages knowing she would be better taken\
  \ care of than in Kathmandu. My last sight of her was seeing her sprint, legs flying,\
  \ down the middle of the highway. Weaving through and under roaring trucks, she\
  \ ran after our bus as fast as she could. Through thick, snotty tears, I couldn\u2019\
  t watch her almost colliding with trucks and looked away. I\u2019ve never seen her\
  \ since."
