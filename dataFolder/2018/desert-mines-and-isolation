Text: "We came to a stop in the middle of absolute nothingness , and everyone got\
  \ out to look at the map.  I soon realized that we didn\u2019t know where we were\
  \ going.  Lucho knew where we needed to go in theory, but didn\u2019t know the way\
  \ through the many valleys that winded through the desert.  Decided on a route,\
  \ we got back in and drove on.  As we winded around another salt flat, we saw a\
  \ sign that made us all very uneasy.  Peligro, Campo Minado.  Danger, mine field.\
  \  Lucho explained that during a war with Argentina, the Chilean army placed mines\
  \ all along the mountainous border between the two countries.  Over the years, the\
  \ infrequent but heavy rains and seasonal snow melt cause heavy mudslides, causing\
  \ all of them to shift, and many were still left undiscovered even after troops\
  \ went to remove them.  And we now had to drive right through it.  Drive.  Through.\
  \  Active.  Mines.  Now we were two days from civilization, following a strange\
  \ man into a field of military explosives and no one knew exactly where we were\
  \ going, if anybody has ever driven through here or what the probability of detonation\
  \ was.  Lucho gave a great anecdote about a friend he knew who hit a mine.  His\
  \ truck was blown up six feet into the air, but he survived.  So we would be fine,\
  \ clearly.  We stop to discuss our strategy: one truck moves first, the other follows\
  \ in its tracks.  You\u2019d hope for a game of straws first, but Lucho offered\
  \ for us to take the lead.  When in Rome\u2026be the first to drive into an active\
  \ mine field.\n\nAfter finally reaching the bottom we realized that we were not\
  \ even half way.  The desert seemed nearly impenetrable.  The peaks never seemed\
  \ to come closer.  There came a point where even Lucho seemed to struggle.  We all\
  \ reconvened at a distant hill we knew to be our rendezvous point.  The sun was\
  \ going to set in about two hours, we were only about two thirds of the way through\
  \ the basin.  We only knew in theory how to arrive at our camp, hidden on the other\
  \ side of the ridge.  Not one of us, even Lucho, had ever been here.  We had varying\
  \ perceptions of where we were supposed to be and the desert is enormous, an area\
  \ the size of Colorado:  105,000 squared Kilometers of nothingness.    We weren\u2019\
  t sure if we would arrive, but we knew there was only one option, the only option\
  \ we ever had throughout this trip: keep moving."
