Text: "We'd traveled to Tamarindo, a small beach town in Costa Rica, in search of\
  \ new experiences and adventure. Upon arriving, I never imagined I'd end up in the\
  \ center of a crocodile infested estuary, completely trapped on all sides by opposing\
  \ currents. You see, just down the beach from the home where we were staying (with\
  \ some French locals) was an estuary. When the tide was low the water was only a\
  \ foot or two deep, making it easy to walk across to a private beach. My travel\
  \ companion and I had just made the journey over to the beach that morning while\
  \ the tide was low, but we'd stayed a couple hours longer than planned. By the time\
  \ we needed to leave, the estuary was well overhead. \n\nMy friend and I stood on\
  \ the edge of the private beach, examined the rising tide, and realized that we\
  \ were going to have to either take a boat across, or swim. Just then, a fisherman\
  \ in a small boat pulled up and offered to take us to shore for a couple of dollars.\
  \ I thought this sounded like a wonderful idea, but unfortunately, we'd left our\
  \ money at the house. My friend is both a surfer and a lifeguard, and was confident\
  \ that we didn't need a boat to make it to shore. I hoped he was right. We thought\
  \ that if we swam fast, hopefully the crocodiles wouldn't bother us. After all,\
  \ we'd heard some local surfers talking about crossing it earlier, and no one mentioned\
  \ anything about anyone being eaten by crocodiles. Although, I did hear some people\
  \ say that some local dogs were eaten by the crocs.\n\nIt was time to swim. We jumped\
  \ into the water, and swam as fast as our bodies would allow. When I reached the\
  \ center of the estuary, I felt the tides from every angle push against me, holding\
  \ me down. I tried to swim forward, but the tides were too powerful. My effort was\
  \ wasted as I paddled and kicked furiously with no result. My friend had already\
  \ made it past the currents, and was almost to shore. All I could think about was\
  \ whether or not there were crocodiles under my feet. I was in a panic, so I called\
  \ to my friend for help. Just as he'd made it to shore, he heard my cry, and turned\
  \ around to see I was struggling. In one swift movement, my friend jumped back in\
  \ the water and began swimming my way. I tried to stay calm, but I couldn't. My\
  \ breathing was getting faster, and darkness was rapidly closing in on me. When\
  \ I awoke I was laying on the beach in his arms. I'd escaped the croc infested waters...\
  \ but how would I escape him?"
