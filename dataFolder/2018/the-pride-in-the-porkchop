Text: "It was only our second day in Ho Chi Minh, but already we had settled into\
  \ a routine: wake up late, walk around to get some food, amble back to the hotel,\
  \ lounge in bed, then repeat steps two to four until it was time to sleep.\n\nMy\
  \ husband noted how much like a \"staycation\" this leg of our trip was. I knew\
  \ he wanted to do more, to take perhaps another one of his wonderful photos. But\
  \ we've been doing that for the past two weeks: across the thoroughfares of Melaka,\
  \ up the volcanoes and temples of Indonesia. I, on the other hand, just wanted to\
  \ eat.\n\n\"Food,\" I said pointedly, reminding him of the waiver he'd agreed to\
  \ at the start of the trip. \"We came to Saigon for food.\"\n\nIt was the second\
  \ time that day that we stepped out of our hotel, into the wild streets of Pham\
  \ Ngu Lao. It was time for lunch.\n\nDodging scooters, I dragged my husband across\
  \ the street. We slid past cam s\xE0nh hawkers and roadside performers, all shielded\
  \ from the afternoon heat by one of those conical hats known as n\xF3n l\xE1. Finally,\
  \ we arrived at an alley. Its mouth flanked by a couple of food carts.\n\nA h\u1EBB\
  m eatery.\n\nExcitement filled the air.\n\nI'd spent the last hour in our hotel\
  \ room googling Vietnamese food terms. I listened to recorded pronunciations, testing\
  \ how they sounded with my own voice. I couldn't wait to try out the words I learned.\
  \ So, over the sound and smell of pork grilling, I spoke.\n\nThe small middle-aged\
  \ man who took our orders ignored my mangled Vietnamese, resorting instead to pointing\
  \ at the array of pork, egg, and meatloaf and watching if I nod or not. I sighed\
  \ and relented. He then ushered us further down the alley, where several low plastic\
  \ tables were strewn on one side. We picked our spot and squeezed ourselves between\
  \ local patrons.\n\nIt didn't take long for our order to arrive. I was expecting\
  \ a lunch of rice with grilled pork and fried egg. The pork was missing.\n\nI tugged\
  \ the arm of the lady who brought our food. She looked at me, then to my plate,\
  \ then back at me quizzically.\n\nI started to say \"pork\", but the lady just furrowed\
  \ her brows. I squeezed my eyes shut, racking my brain for the right word.\n\n\"\
  Su...\", I began.\n\nShe blinked.\n\nI tried again. \"Nu... Nuong?\"\n\nShe smiled.\
  \ \"Thit nuong.\"\n\nI nodded triumphantly as I watched her shuffle away with my\
  \ plate. Moments later, she was back with all my orders.\n\nI beamed as I dug through\
  \ the food, dousing everything in tangy fish sauce.\n\nThat meal had been especially\
  \ satisfying."
