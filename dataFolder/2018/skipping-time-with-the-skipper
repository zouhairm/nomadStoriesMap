Text: "\u2018You agreed to be picked up by a stranger you spoke to for 10 minutes\
  \ on a boat?\u2019 My friend asks me with confusion regarding my recent encounter\
  \ with Damien. Damien and I met at Milford Sound, New Zealand. He was the Skipper\
  \ of the tour boat I was on. Our first contact was in the wheelhouse of the boat\
  \ where we had a brief conversation. During the chat, we established in two weeks\
  \ our birthdays were arriving and they were three days apart. After this new information\
  \ registered, he insinuated I should consider coming back to celebrate. He wrote\
  \ his name on a piece of paper and told me to contact him on Facebook. Little did\
  \ I know, I would soon be spending a fervent week with the Skipper. \n\nMuch to\
  \ my surprise, the small remote community of Milford Sound was a population of employees\
  \ for tour companies and there was no cellphone reception. Generally speaking, tourists\
  \ only take day trips to visit the area; the reality I was staying one week was\
  \ unheard of. In fact, it was against company policy to let guests stay with employees.\
  \ This breach of conduct was unfolding to becoming a passionate, awakening story.\n\
  \nIn the first twenty-four hours, it was clear there was an instant emotional connection\
  \ and chemistry between us. We shared a great deal in common about music genres\
  \ and perceptions on life. The immediate understanding of one another was unexpected\
  \ and vivid. Our time together carried on and there was an air to us both that knew\
  \ we should leave our feelings unexpressed for the fact I was a traveller. Consequently,\
  \ I finally asked the question on my mind, \u2018how often do you ask tourists to\
  \ hangout?\u2019 The honest response was, he had never done this before. Registering\
  \ to the both of us, our meeting was a sheer act of destiny.  \n\nI left the day\
  \ after his birthday. It was genuinely hard for the both of us to say goodbye. We\
  \ enjoyed each other\u2019s company and wanted more of it. Unfortunately, our life\
  \ paths were not going in the same direction to move forward. I wrote a letter and\
  \ left it on his table thanking him for the amazing time, and expressed how I hoped\
  \ we\u2019d meet again. Though I may never see Damien, travel has made me appreciate\
  \ each person who feeds my soul and teaches me something new about life, and rouses\
  \ beauty from my spirit. The soul craves resonance. When resonance is found, transformation\
  \ begins. Thus, to answer my friend\u2019s question, yes I agreed to be picked up\
  \ by a stranger. Risks, courage, chances; the formula travellers live by to flourish."
