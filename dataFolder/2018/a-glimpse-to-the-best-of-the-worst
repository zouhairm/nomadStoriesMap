Text: "A thought of mine, got revived while watching a movie and it took me not less\
  \ than a moment to plan out for a holiday. And this time, it\u2019s not the thought\
  \ of any mesmerizing foreign land which came to my mind, but a city named Jaisalmer\
  \ in the outskirts of Rajasthan.\nNamed after the Rajput king, Jaisal Singh, Jaisalmer\
  \ has been an integral place of attraction for tourists from various parts of the\
  \ world, because of the traditional lifestyle led by the people living here.\nApart\
  \ from all those famous monuments and sculptures, which included the famous Jaisalmer\
  \ Fort, which was awe-aspiring, what pushed me towards the edge is my decision to\
  \ stay with the locals of that area experiencing their lifestyle.\nSo, I ended-up\
  \ realizing my stay in the house of one of the tourist-guides present. And from\
  \ there my \u2018real journey\u2019 of exploring my own country and its culture\
  \ started.\nAs the night got deepen, I felt the presence of moon in the sky very\
  \ clearly as it is clear that this place doesn\u2019t has electricity all the time\
  \ in a whole day.\nThese things made me realize that despite us being a developing\
  \ country, some parts of it are deprived of access to regular amenities of basic\
  \ needs.\nTill now also, these people doesn\u2019t have access to ample amount of\
  \ water required for their survival and they have to cover miles to get water. And\
  \ for me, being from a place where scarcity of water is a never thought-of fiction,\
  \ the realization of the condition of these people came as a shock.\nApart from\
  \ it, even the food which they get is not so nutrient-rich because of the presence\
  \ of poor quality of the soil. \nWatching the survival of these people made me set\
  \ aback for a while and I thought of various ways in which they can be helped, but\
  \ the fact remains that it\u2019s not that easy, or else it would have been done\
  \ earlier enough. Various measures have already been taken but none have been that\
  \ of a success because of the natural as well as political issues involved.\nBut\
  \ apart from these negative impacts, I think these conditions are also a reason\
  \ for the aliveness of the traditional lifestyle of this region as it is still far\
  \ from getting corrupted. \nAnd as far as my experience is concerned, that one of\
  \ stay in that place taught me a lot about not taking things for granted and I also\
  \ got a chance to experience the traditional lifestyle of my country as well.\n\
  That one night really pushed me to an edge and made me realize the fact that the\
  \ life which I have living is really a gifted one."
