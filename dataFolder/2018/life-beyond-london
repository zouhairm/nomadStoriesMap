Text: "Each step that I took on Ammassalik Island\u2019s Mittivakkat Glacier was a\
  \ tantalising game of Russian roulette; the snow covering made me an easy victim\
  \ to crevasses. However, in a bid to distance myself from a polar bear that I\u2019\
  d just seen, concern over whether the ground would fall through was not a priority.\
  \ \n\nGreenland. \n\nBefore exploring Greenland, I probably would have told you\
  \ that \u2018exciting\u2019 meant a heated Brexit debate. Na\xEFve to life beyond\
  \ London, I had never once slept in a tent. Even so, despite initial disorientation\
  \ due to the sun illuminating the rugged terrain for twenty four hours a day, I\
  \ was pleasantly surprised at my ease during my first night beneath a canvas shelter\
  \ with a team of twelve. Our home for three weeks. I was in awe of the raw, stark\
  \ beauty of my surroundings. Ammassalik Island, Greenland, was home to less than\
  \ 2,100 people, who were only first contacted in 1914. The wind was the music of\
  \ the mountains. The icebergs rose up from the sea in masses, reflecting the sunlight\
  \ in an empowerment of nature.\n\nOn day nine, after summiting a 916m peak in one\
  \ day, we were rewarded with sheer exhilaration as we soared back down the mountain\u2019\
  s slopes, narrowly dodging the rocks that occasionally protruded from beneath the\
  \ snow. The catch? The polar bear. \n\nAlthough I had to strain my eyes to distinguish\
  \ the formidable polar bear situated about two hundred metres away, I could not\
  \ wish away its presence or switch the TV channel. This was real. \u2018They can\
  \ run so fast, Louise, at forty kilometres per hour\u2019, I remembered my Mum anxiously\
  \ chide in my ear on the way to Gatwick Airport. I could only hope that the bear\
  \ was not hungry.\n\nStep by step, my team and I marched in a stunned silence until\
  \ we finally set up camp six hours later. Even though at this point I was plagued\
  \ by fiercely drooping eyelids, once I had sat down I could not stop myself from\
  \ laughing, somewhat hysterically. In the face of danger, miraculously, I\u2019\
  d found elation, excitement and adrenaline. \n\nI returned home not only in one\
  \ piece, but with the ability to laugh at materialism, insignificant insecurities,\
  \ and the insanely competitive society of corporate skyscrapers that I have grown\
  \ up in. Indeed, Greenland\u2019s unpredictable, spectacular wilderness has given\
  \ me a new, focused drive, and revealed to me that there is so much life beyond\
  \ London."
