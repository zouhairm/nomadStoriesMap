  \ hotel\u201D.\n\nMy partner Dean and I were heading out to dinner on a balmy evening\
  \ in the Caribbean port city of Bluefields. We\u2019d walked downstairs only to\
  \ find the gate that led to the street padlocked shut leaving us stuck behind a\
  \ high fence. Banging on the door of the dark reception proved fruitless and as\
  \ we stood there in the dim light, sizing up the fence we realised that if we were\
  \ going to eat that night, the only way was up.\n Ramshackle and rundown Bluefields\
  \ is a melting pot of Caribbean, Latin and Indigenous cultures. Our time here was\
  \ supposed to be nothing more than a quick overnight stay, a jumping off point on\
  \ our way to the tropical paradise of Nicaragua\u2019s Corn Islands. After spending\
  \ a sultry afternoon in a creaky, floating bar, drinking cervezas and watching the\
  \ boats come and go however, we found ourselves charmed by the city\u2019s laid-back\
  \ vibe and neither of us were disappointed when a booked-out plane meant we had\
  \ to stay in town an extra night.\nDean helped lift me up and as my hands reached\
  \ the top of the fence out of the darkness came a Creole English accented voice,\
  \ asking us what we were doing. A man, a neighbour of the hotel, came over and we\
  \ all had a giggle as we explained our predicament. He tried calling the hotel and\
  \ we listened to the phone ringing inside. Then, he found a chair and leaned it\
  \ against the fence, easing our descent down the other side. Dean boosted me up\
  \ then hauled himself over, and the man helped us both down, like a co-conspirator\
  \ in a gaol-break. Freedom at last. \nThe next morning, while checking out I tried\
  \ to tell the lady behind reception what had happened. She didn\u2019t speak English\
  \ so using a mix of broken Spanish and charades I described the previous night\u2019\
  s adventure. Briefly, her eyes widened in horror before she burst out laughing.\
  \ She called out to the ladies who were working out the back and soon I was re-enacting\
  \ the entire scene again as our laughter echoed around the tiled room.\nNo trip\
  \ ever runs smoothly all the time and some of the joy of travelling is the constant\
  \ discovery of just how much kindness and warmth there is to be found in the world.\
  \ Help can come from the most unexpected places and people are often quick to lend\
  \ a hand or plastic garden chair. Laughter is the quickest way through any cultural\
  \ or language barrier and often it\u2019s when things don\u2019t go perfectly to\
  \ plan that we create our most memorable connections with others."
