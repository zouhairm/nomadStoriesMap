Text: "Like every other day we had trekking along the Annapurna mountain range, come\
  \ lunch time it chucked it down. On previous days we would keep calm and carry on\
  \ but the quantity of water mother nature was throwing at us and the degree of our\
  \ decent forced us inside with little to do except playing drinking games with hot\
  \ tea until the worst of it passed. It continued to rain all the way until we reached\
  \ campsite in Hillie where our porters had already set up our tents and the main\
  \ eating tent. Just mere moments after putting my bag in a puddle and sitting down\
  \ with a hot chocolate the rain stopped and the rest of the party turned the last\
  \ corner into camp. \nAfter our final diner as a trekking party we all descended\
  \ on this poor unsuspecting bar. When I say bar in a village of less than 50 people,\
  \ I mean an above average sized shed that sold alcohol and also doubled up as a\
  \ corner shop selling various tins of questionably dated consumables, rice and basic\
  \ toiletries. It was the Nepalese version of Albert Arkwright\u2019s shop from Open\
  \ All Hours. Apparently, the little old lady that ran the place was used to groups\
  \ of trekkers piling in and taking over. What followed was the one of the best nights\
  \ of my life. Fuelled by beer and Gurkha rum we were treated to the trekking staff\
  \ singing a selection of traditional Nepalese songs and them teaching us how to\
  \ dance resulting in some truly fantastic dance offs. We taught the Sherpas and\
  \ porters how to do the hokey cokey and marketed it as a traditional English war\
  \ dance to rival the haka. I don\u2019t think they believed us. Then it was time\
  \ for the headlining act for the evening. Myself and one of the other trekkers,\
  \ George, performed a song we created during the trek. Every morning the cooks woke\
  \ us up with the dawn chorus of \u201Ctattapani, tattapani, dut dut\u201D which\
  \ translates as hot water, hot water, milk, milk. With the help of a madal drum,\
  \ George and I proceeded to repeat those four words in a semi tuneful manor for\
  \ about three minutes. After their initial shock of two people singing about hot\
  \ water and milk, one by one everyone joined in until the full team of just over\
  \ forty people were involved. We were convinced it would reach number one in the\
  \ Nepalese charts by the end of the week. By the end of the night we had blown the\
  \ roof off the joint and nearly shook it from its supports to slid down the mountain.\
  \ The Himalayas echoed with the sound of drums and laughter."
