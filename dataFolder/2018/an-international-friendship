Text: "We sat naked on the edge of the onsen, or hot spring, in the mountain town\
  \ of Kinosaki, Japan. The indoor pool was so hot I could only dip my toes into the\
  \ water. I marveled at the other women who lounged up to the neck, unfazed.\n\n\u201C\
  The outside pool is easier,\u201D said my friend, Rumi. She and I were coworkers\
  \ at an elementary school. Though older than my mother, after two years she had\
  \ become my closest friend in Japan.\n\nOutside, the winter air was biting, but\
  \ the hot water was much easier to bear. A waterfall cascaded through greenery into\
  \ a natural stone bath. The rippling sound of the water mixed with the gentle murmur\
  \ of the other bathers. I sank into water that felt like satin on my skin, and the\
  \ stress of work ebbed out of my toes.  \n\n\u201CSee, this is onsen water,\u201D\
  \ cooed Rumi.\n\nWe soaked until we became too warm, then we donned our clothing\
  \ and walked to the next bath. The crisp air now felt refreshing. The main road\
  \ was picturesque, centered over a canal with willow trees draped over cobbled walkways.\
  \  Elegant wooden store fronts and inns nestled against the valley slopes, creating\
  \ an intimate atmosphere. \n\n\u201CThank you for taking me here,\u201D I said.\n\
  \n\u201COf course! This is an international friendship.\u201D That was Rumi's phrase\
  \ for everything. I once tried to give her a gift in return for her generosity.\
  \ She accepted, but, like a stern mother, insisted that I never buy her anything\
  \ again, because ours was \u201Can international friendship.\u201D\n \n\nThe setting\
  \ sun behind the clouds cast a blue light over the valley. Lamps glowed along the\
  \ canal, reflected in the water. The scent of steamed snow crab wafted through the\
  \ air. We stood on a bridge, watching people move from bath to bath, dressed in\
  \ colorful Japanese robes and wooden sandals, geta. The clopping sound of the geta\
  \ echoed through the evening, meditative.\n\n\u201CI will be very bored when you\
  \ leave,\u201D Rumi said quietly.\n\nSoon, I would return to the US. Rumi would\
  \ help me many more times before I left. She would be there at midnight, helping\
  \ me pack. She would call five different recycle shops, looking for one to take\
  \ my furniture. She would take me to a cat-cafe to ease the stress of saying goodbye\
  \ to my students. And she would be the last person I messaged before turning off\
  \ my phone. That was Rumi, my mother in Japan. She worked hard to ease my troubles\
  \ and expected nothing in return, like the healing waters of Kinosaki.\n\n\u201C\
  Thank you for helping me so much.\u201D She smiled and shook her head.\n\n\u201C\
  This is an international friendship.\u201D"
