Text: "\u2018Rangitoto-A red sky\u2019. The sleeping volcano that had sprung from\
  \ the depths of the ocean over 600 years ago. I had used it as an escape from the\
  \ concrete landscape of Central Auckland. Having arrived in New Zealand two days\
  \ before, i needed open air. The ferry ride was like nothing i had ever been on\
  \ as low tidal waves brushed against its bow. \n\nWhen i stepped onto the modern\
  \ concrete pier, i was struck by the greenness of the nature and the solitude. In\
  \ my leather boots and green flannel shirt, i started my trek as though i was stepping\
  \ onto a western film set. There was a fork in the paths. Instead of following the\
  \ rest of the inhabitants who had just shared a 40 minutes ferry ride along the\
  \ Haruki Gulf i bore left and into  the Pohutukawa Forest. I emerged onto a different\
  \ part of the Island, the curvage of the trees were like arms pointing the way and\
  \ onto a path with a steep ascension. The ascension to the crater. Suddenly then\
  \ i realised my map provided by a cabin crew member was gone. They had said \u201C\
  You\u2019ll need this map to navigate the island, otherwise prepare for a long night.\u201D\
  \ I did not know where the path would take me, i just followed my gut and carried\
  \ on my ascent. Halfway up the path, i could still hear the beautiful ocean song\
  \ and the light breeze brushed my brow.  \n\nI passed two solo travellers. I smiled\
  \ at both. But neither returned the favour. I noticed while catching breath, a long\
  \ branch leaning against a bouldered wall. It seemed to have been carved into a\
  \ staff. I claimed it as my own. A third solo figure descended the path. There was\
  \ a confidence in his stance and a clarity in his eyes. I was like meeting an old\
  \ friend for the first time. We both stopped, i smiled. So did he. \u201CI\u2019\
  m lost\u201D I said. \u201CThat\u2019s a big stick\u201D He responded. We laughed.\
  \ The natural heat of the island grew as we stood chatting. His broad American accent\
  \ sharpened the detail he spoke about the island \u2019s curved coastal paths and\
  \ recommended a beach nearby. He held out his map. \u201CHere, I\u2019ve been along\
  \ this path before. I know my way around.\u201D I took it and for a second our fingers\
  \ brushed each other. The stick hit the brown granules of the clay ground. He picked\
  \ it up. I tried to convince him to take it. But he declined. We politely made our\
  \ ways in opposite directions. My heart would not stop racing. His green opaque\
  \ eyes and unique smile had added something to Rangitoto\u2019s rustiness. They\
  \ also added something to my life for the better and greeted me every day since."
