Text: "Scene: Lucerne, Switzerland. The morning of the first day of Fasnacht. Light\
  \ snow falls from the sky as the Morgenwacht, morning watch, sounds.\n\nScene 1:\
  \ A quaking boom fills the ears of the brave explorers in their hotel room.\n\n\
  Brave Explorer 1 (not so bravely):\nWe\u2019re under attack!\n\nThey rush outside,\
  \ their feet drawn to the cries and blasts echoing around the city. A masked group\
  \ in sandy robes holding large golden instruments create explosions of noise as\
  \ melodies rise over a beating drum. The explorers sidle past the group unnoticed\
  \ as the percussion rumbles beneath their feet.\n\nMasks of witches, possessed children\
  \ and evil spirits leer from street windows as they trek deeper into the city. The\
  \ disguised revellers bind the explorers with an invisible lasso, dragging them\
  \ towards the heart of the festivities. The trickle of people become a flood of\
  \ musicians, dancers, and actors.\n\nThere is no explanation for the madness. They\
  \ venture further.\n\nScene 2: Packed with crowds full of reckless abandon, the\
  \ explorers continue down a narrow street, sidling past witches pushing prams speckled\
  \ with blood. From stage left, three headed mice topped with bejewelled crowns hurry\
  \ past them. The explorers cower behind a brass band of Stetson clad skeletons who\
  \ soon clash with an orchestra of disfigured sailors. The cacophony of dissonance\
  \ as the two Guggenmusiken collide drowns out the shouts and the screams of delight.\n\
  \nBrave Explorer 1 (to a man pulling a wheeled cage with his children in it):\n\
  The city\u2019s gone mad!\n\nMan with Captured Children (laughing):\nIt is because\
  \ it\u2019s the end of the world.\n\nScene 3: Hordes line the sides of the Spreuer\
  \ Bridge. The 14th Century Kapellbr\xFCcke, the oldest covered bridge in Europe,\
  \ sits as the historic backdrop to the ever-maddening parade playing out on centre\
  \ stage.\n\nBrave Explorer 1 (to Helpful Local):\nWe have been seeking an answer\
  \ all day to explain the masks, the costumes, the music. What is happening here?\n\
  \nHelpful Local (dressed as the grim reaper):\nIt is Fasnacht! It happens every\
  \ year.\n\nBrave Explorer 2 (desperately):\nBut what is the reason for all of this?\
  \ \n\nHelpful Local (smiling):\nWould you believe, we don\u2019t need a reason.\n\
  \nIt is the last thing they expect.\n\nRealisation dawns.\n\nThe day\u2019s madness\
  \ did not have a reason to offer them because it did not need one. And so, for the\
  \ explorers, the experience of the inhibition-free, chaotic-filled, city-wide celebrations\
  \ immediately become all the sweeter.\n\nCurtain."
