Text: "The city of Touba is the holiest city of Senegal where people pilgrim on a\
  \ quest for honor and reverence. It is also the place with the largest Bayfal population\
  \ in the country.\n\nThe Bayfal are a ramification of the Muslim religion, dreadlocked\
  \ peoples who dress in rainbow range clothing and are usually found chanting barefoot\
  \ in markets in return for slabs of fish or vegetables.\n\nAs I walked the streets\
  \ looking for a place to stay I came across a man named Aliufal who invited me to\
  \ stay with him and his people. Their home was a cluster of single foam mattresses\
  \ and Koranic texts atop a sand floor. A radio murmured static speech as a deaf\
  \ man introduced himself wordlessly yet cheerfully.\n\nAliufal believed that everything\
  \ was purely destined by God and that all things occur according to the way in which\
  \ \u201Che\u201D programs existence. If anything happens it's because it's meant\
  \ to happen, and there's no participation on his own behalf on what will be. He\
  \ had a desire to travel the world. When I asked why he didn't do it he replied\
  \ that God didn't have that in mind for him just yet. He said that if God did plan\
  \ that for him then he would have the means to travel. \n\nOn Friday it was pray\
  \ day and more than 7,000 muslims flocked to the big mosque to gratefully pray for\
  \ life and creation. Aliufal was eager to take me and show me the ways of his traditions.\
  \ \n\nBodies were rapidly sucked into the building as we made our way to the entrance.\
  \ Once inside we traversed to the other side of the hall where I boldly looked to\
  \ the left to witness innumerable faces fixing their gaze upon me row after row\
  \ in a colossal silence. I was the only white skinned person in town. \n\nWe sat\
  \ down on the white tiled floor waiting for prayer to begin. I had to keep a swift\
  \ eye on the row in front to mimic their actions without delay. I didn\u2019t want\
  \ my figure to protrude from the elegant synchrony their bodies were producing.\
  \ \n\nThere's something very special about the phrase \"Allah Akbar\" chanted in\
  \ the prayer and how the ear digests it. There's a certain ring to it, the way the\
  \ letters unfold from the mouth and launch into the air is captivating. People bend\
  \ down to their knees right after, ensorcelled by the sound in mass unity.\n \n\
  After the prayer finished people seemed tranquil and tuned in to the same frequency.\
  \ This is when I realized the tight binding power religion has amongst members of\
  \ society, something that people may lovingly share and relate to collectively.\
  \ Thank you Aliufal."
