Text: "When friends regale you with tales of drunken nights in foreign lands, they\
  \ paint a smoky picture of cheap drinks, sticky floors and blurry deeds. Let's face\
  \ it, in any city, in any location, this story is a familiar travel companion. So\
  \ when we decided to start drinking citrus-flavoured alco-pops from a suburban Tokyo\
  \ vending machine, I expected that we would follow the familiar night-on-the-town\
  \ trope. Instead, I found myself amongst the quiet dwellings of Sumida, trying to\
  \ tempt stray kittens with slivers of food purchased from a nearby 7-eleven. \n\n\
  Japan, it would seem, has a large population of stray cats. They hide everywhere,\
  \ huddled under shrubs or perched behind waste baskets, their survival ensured by\
  \ people who leave food and water in public places for them to consume. Having just\
  \ spent the afternoon at a cat cafe, we decided that the only logical course of\
  \ action was to try and tame a Tokyo street kitten. So we sat in a concrete park,\
  \ drinks in hand, debating whether Japanese cats would understand English if we\
  \ tried to call them over.\n\n'How do you say 'Come here?'  in Japanese?' my friend\
  \ mused, as someone else looked up Google translate. As we coaxed kittens with potato\
  \ chips and soft voices, the gentle closing of doors and windows from surrounding\
  \ houses reminded us that we were in the midst of fully-functioning metropolis.\
  \ Crazy foreigners, drinking on the street, yelling at cats. \n\nAnd this, I came\
  \ to realise, is the strange and beautiful essence of Japan. The big-city squeeze\
  \ of a burgeoning population is knitted together by the underlying acceptance that\
  \ essentially, people are all a little strange. I never expected that I would spend\
  \ my precious holiday time doing something so mundane \u2013 but I'm glad I did."
