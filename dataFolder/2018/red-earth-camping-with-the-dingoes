Text: "\u201CThis is home for tonight\u201D. As the sun sets over the flat surface\
  \ of the Australian outback, our tour guide Wayne pulls the 4-wheel drive onto a\
  \ patch of hard, red ground and prompts our little group of ten to jump out. I\u2019\
  m about to spend my first night out here, far away from the civilised world, in\
  \ little more than a sleeping bag. I realise what I\u2019ve signed up for as Wayne\
  \ explains how we need to collect firewood: Give it a little kick with the foot\
  \ first, to make sure no snakes are hiding underneath. Australia is home to some\
  \ of the most toxic snakes in the world.\nSitting around the fire after a delicious\
  \ homemade chilli, holding metal cups filled with red wine, Wayne points out the\
  \ star signs in the cloudless night sky. The flickering of the fireplace, the murmur\
  \ of voices and the chirping crickets soon have an effect and as usual, it\u2019\
  s an early night for our group. \nWe\u2019re moving into a world without cars let\
  \ alone mobile phone signal, bouncing along the sandy desert roads while the sun\
  \ is burning from the sky. Lake Eyre is a salt lake almost the size of Belgium which\
  \ is dry for most of the year. Crystallised salt pieces lie on the red sand like\
  \ broken ice from the surface of a frozen lake and this view endlessly stretches\
  \ in all directions. We stand on top of the hills of the Painted Desert, the different\
  \ shades of the sand varying from almost white to ochre, red and brown. We stop\
  \ in tiny outback townships that resemble ghost towns with dusty roads where the\
  \ blazing heat literally stands in the streets. The flies try to enter eyes, nostrils\
  \ and mouth. They sit on our t-shirts like hundreds of small dots. But the flies\
  \ aren\u2019t the only animals we encounter in this seemingly unliveable land. While\
  \ we\u2019re passing through different terrain every day, we encounter lizards,\
  \ wild horses and camels, kangaroos, wallabies \u2013 and dingoes, a type of wild\
  \ dog native to Australia and Asia. \nArriving in Alice Springs, I realise for the\
  \ first time since starting the trip how dirty I am. Although we were able to shower\
  \ every other day, the red sand seems to have gotten everywhere. Slightly embarrassed,\
  \ I take a long shower and do my laundry. All the time I have to hold back tears.\
  \ I\u2019ve only been in the desert for ten days but being back in the civilised,\
  \ loud world is getting to me. That night I don\u2019t sleep well although I\u2019\
  m exhausted. I miss the crackling and the smell of the fire and the stars that gazed\
  \ upon me in the remoteness of the red Australian outback."
