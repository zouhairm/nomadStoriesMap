Text: "The summer of 2017, I had the honor of going to Tanzania, Africa. Before I\
  \ get started telling my adventures, let me just clarify what a tremendous opportunity\
  \ this was; ever since I was a little girl, I have dreamed of traveling the world,\
  \ and I was finally getting my wish granted. \n I worked in an orphanage for 10\
  \ days, and traveled all around Tanzania doing things such as, handing out rice\
  \ to the hungry, and walking down the streets of Moshi, getting chased by salesmen\
  \ trying to sell you the same painting of an elephant that I had seen at least a\
  \ million times before. \n \n  My time in the orphanage was life-changing. I worked\
  \ in \"Safe Haven\" orphanage run by Keith Powers. \nwhen I first arrived to the\
  \ orphanage, these sweet children's home, I was in utter shock.  Around the orphanage,\
  \ there was a humongous wall; this was there to keep out thieves and animals. There\
  \ was an intimidating guard outside walking around the entrance. Despite his large\
  \ build, and mean eyes, there was a kind and grateful soul. He let us in with no\
  \ trouble; when I drove in, It was a large brick building, with a few windows and\
  \ a door larger than all the children combined. There was a water hole, and a shelter\
  \ with bricks and soccer balls for the children to play with. I was greeted with\
  \ small hands tugging my shirt asking for me to follow along. The children brought\
  \ me inside the orphanage. There was two large rooms. One room was a kitchen, and\
  \ the other, was a room with beds. \n\n The children loved to play soccer, and learn\
  \ new songs. One child in-particular, named \"Namiea\" caught my attention. She\
  \ was my shadow all week. She spoke the best English, and helped me communicate\
  \ with the others much better. Namiea wore the same outfit every day; she wore a\
  \ black polka dot dress, and black sneakers. A man I was with brought new dresses\
  \ for all the little girls, Namiea was so excited about her new dress! I had never\
  \ seen anyone, especially a child, for that matter, be so thankful for something\
  \ so small. \n\n The culture in Africa is something that is forever indebted in\
  \ my soul. So rich, pure, and unique. I made life-long friendships with everyone\
  \ I encountered there. Language barriers or not; there was a greater connection\
  \ that did not need words to certify it. I still receive messages, and letters from\
  \ my friends there, and plan to go back very soon!"
