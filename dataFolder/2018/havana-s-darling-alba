Text: "Alba is a stunning Cuban girl in her late 20s who has a different hairstyle\
  \ every other day from flowing, just-got-out-of-the-shower curls, to a pixie cut.\
  \ She has freckles dotting her cheeks, big brown eyes and a smile that say\u2019\
  s she\u2019s up for anything. Alba is much more progressive than a lot of the other\
  \ Cubans I met. For one, she\u2019s travelled to Europe, which she talks about constantly,\
  \ but Cuban social issues such as low wages equally. After spending a day wandering\
  \ Havana watching tourists being ferried in hot pink classic convertibles beneath\
  \ the old quarter\u2019s crumbling Spanish facades, we headed west to a beautiful\
  \ country town named Vi\xF1ales. Stretching our legs, we stood at the top of the\
  \ Vi\xF1ales valley, wondering how we came to be in this beautiful, verdant place\
  \ together on a tiny island where the Atlantic meets the Caribbean Sea. At least\
  \ that\u2019s what I was thinking \u2013 Alba has seen it many times before. She\
  \ would prefer to gaze at the Trevi Fountain no doubt, but she still inhaled the\
  \ misty air deeply and smiled with her eyes. We ate a modest meal of black beans,\
  \ rice and spiced chicken while we sheltered from the rain that just set in, chickens\
  \ scrambling around our feet blissfully unaware they\u2019re part of a restaurant\
  \ ecosystem. This was a beautiful pit stop, but our destination was the little community\
  \ of Las Terrazas in the Sierra del Rosario Biosphere Reserve. If you research Las\
  \ Terrazas, you may read along the lines of \u2018an idyllic little community, great\
  \ flora and fauna,\u2019 and so on. But you can\u2019t exactly wander around Las\
  \ Terrazas by yourself. Or maybe you could? You would probably want to ask why there\
  \ were armed sentries with rifles strolling the perimeter of the village 24/7 before\
  \ you gave it a go, though. Upon arrival we received a lovely introduction from\
  \ a handsome local who was born in Las Terrazas and would likely die in Las Terrazas,\
  \ too. A lone voice from the back interrupted him, \u201CCan\u2019t you see you\
  \ live in a fucking prison?\u201D His eyes darted around the patio after Alba\u2019\
  s comment to see if anyone heard the outburst before moving on with a nervous laugh.\
  \ We spent the day swimming in freezing watering holes, hiking through the lush\
  \ forest and eating at the community's only restaurant, but I was saddened that\
  \ Alba wasn\u2019t allowed to sit at our table. Alba shrugged it off. She\u2019\
  s in Rome now and if I understood her at all, she\u2019s missing her Cuba but also\
  \ enjoys a freedom she could never imagine as a little girl."
