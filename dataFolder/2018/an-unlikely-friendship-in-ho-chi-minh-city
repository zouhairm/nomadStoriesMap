Text: "My second day in Vietnam, I met the owner of my guest house who invited me\
  \ to go to the local market with her.  It was chaotic, loud, smelly, hot, busy,\
  \ with people everywhere. It was so different than the other touristy food markets\
  \ I had seen in other parts of Asia. This one was real and raw, and I loved it.\
  \ \n\nThis woman was on a mission! She knew exactly what she needed and where everything\
  \ was. We weaved through crowded streets past fruits, fish, vegetables, even live\
  \ snakes! During our walk, Chau told me how she didn\u2019t love her husband, how\
  \ she married too young, how much she just wanted to be free and travel on her own.\
  \ And as she was saying all this, I just thought wow this is what I\u2019m doing-\
  \ traveling on my own as a single woman. I thought she was the one who had this\
  \ really great life- a family, a business, a husband, and she was jealous of me?\
  \ I also couldn\u2019t help but think how familiar her thoughts sounded- that what\
  \ she was saying could be, and has been, said by any number of American women.\n\
  \nI thought of Vietnam as such a foreign place, and well, it WAS foreign to me-\
  \ the culture, the weather, the food, the religion, the people. But in this moment,\
  \ I realized maybe it\u2019s people aren\u2019t so different. \n\nI arrived in Vietnam\
  \ very tired- mentally (traveling really does require a lot of mental energy), physically\
  \ (I had not slept in 24 hours) and emotionally (I missed was starting to miss home)\
  \ and I just felt pretty alone. But this woman, this amazing, strong, independent\
  \ woman, helped me feel welcome in this very foreign place.  The fact that she opened\
  \ up to me and told me all about her life and her vulnerabilities in just a short\
  \ amount of time and showed me the market that she goes to every single day, was\
  \ just incredibly moving. \n\nI did a lot of really cool things in Vietnam, but\
  \ it was my second day in Vietnam that ended up being the best. It wasn\u2019t a\
  \ truly remarkable landscape that I saw or something super adventurous like I would\
  \ have expected, it was just an honest conversation between two women from two very\
  \ different worlds, who realized they had much more in common than they thought.\
  \ \n\nChau told me that our friendship has been one of the most valuable things\
  \ in her life this year, and I could not agree more. How could we have possibly\
  \ known that we needed each other so much at that moment in time? She just needed\
  \ someone to talk to and relate to, and me? Well, I think I needed the exact same\
  \ thing."
