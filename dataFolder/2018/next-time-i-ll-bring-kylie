Text: "\u201CYou\u2019re not from around here?\u201D asked a tiny woman dressed in\
  \ an equally tiny white dress, grubby, paired with glitter-encrusted platform heels.\
  \ \u201CAre you norteamericana?\u201D\n\nAs I\u2019ve learnt to do everywhere in\
  \ the world, I violently shook my head to signify 'No,  I am not American.' \n\n\
  \u201CPhew!\u201D The street lights exposed nasty scars around her neck. \u201C\
  I\u2019m MiRANda!\u201D She was MiRANda and she was HERE. \n\u201CNot a fan of the\
  \ States?\u201D\n\u201CI HATE.\u201D\n\u201CMaybe a wall wouldn\u2019t be such a\
  \ bad thing then.\u201D I flashed my cheeky teeth.\n\u201CFuck Trump,\u201D she\
  \ said, laughing, in English. And then back to Spanish. \u201CSo where are you from?\u201D\
  \ \_\n\u201CAustralia.\u201D\n\u201CYou know Kylie Minogue?\u201D\n\u201CClaro!\u201D\
  \ Look, I knew of her. I tried to recall a single Kylie song. I could only think\
  \ of \u2018Where the Wild Roses Grow\u2019, but judging by her shoes, I figured\
  \ Nick Cave might not be Miranda\u2019s bag. \_\n\u201CI saw her in 2011! My inspiraci\xF3\
  n. La-la-la, la-la-la-la-la.\u201D\n\nOf course! Lyrics from 2001 So Fresh woke\
  \ somewhere in my brain and I started to sing.\n\u201CI-just-can\u2019t-get-you-out-of-my-head!\u201D\
  \n\nMy friend Tim, agape, stood next to me wondering just what he was witnessing.\
  \ He had just seen me erupt into song and dance with a homeless Mexican woman. He\u2019\
  d probably only understood the words \u201Cfuck\u201D and \u201CTrump.\u201D An\
  \ explanation was necessary.\n\n\u201CKylie Minogue is this Australian singer. I\
  \ had no idea she's popular in Mexico?\u201D\n\nAs I took a bite of my first taco,\
  \ I noticed Miranda's wrist bones stuck out like razorblades.\n\n\u201CHey Miranda,\
  \ can I get you something to eat?\u201D\n\u201CThank you!\u201D She did a little\
  \ dance. \u201CI am hungry.\u201D\n\u201CWhat do you think of my city?\u201D she\
  \ asked, tucking into some tacos.\n\nFor a moment, I had to think. Earlier that\
  \ day, as I sunned myself in a park, a seedy old man with his lunch dribbled down\
  \ his front approached me.\n\n\u201CA beautiful blanquita in a red dress. Let's\
  \ go to dinner tomorrow night?\u201D\n\nI rejected his offer, citing a fake husband\
  \ and children. He decided to run for it, not forgetting to give me an unreciprocated\
  \ kiss. My third afternoon in Mexico City had left me feeling like I needed a brush\
  \ to scrub at my lips. But now at this taco stand I saw the magic in this place.\
  \ A few pints of chicha played a role in this moment. I looked up at the jacarandas\
  \ in full violet bloom, and down at the rippled concrete, unchanged since the 1985\
  \ quake. A sewer blended with grilling chicken and filled my nostrils with a confusing,\
  \ wonderful stench.\n\n\u201CIt\u2019s an enormous, beautiful disaster. I'm going\
  \ to be back. Next time I\u2019ll bring Kylie.\u201D"
