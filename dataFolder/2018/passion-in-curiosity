Text: "The western part of the country passing through the biggest forest later on\
  \ , the national park, Nyungwe forest;  located  in Rusizi District slightly near\
  \ the Rwandan border to the Republic Democratic of Congo, there  you find Lake Kivu.\n\
  For my first time having the biggest lake in the country in my eyes, staring at\
  \ the shores and murmuring water, was not only feeling the waves and tides looking\
  \ at ships flowing in water but also getting away the tiredness of the longest route\
  \ journey ever by bus. \nThough I had been dreaming of such moments, by myself I\
  \ had never realized I will go through until flocking journalists escaped the trainings\
  \ site, stationed nearby to enjoy those astonishing moments. \nSteve, One of my\
  \ mates whom we shared ambitious dreams of watching the tides and ships sliding\
  \ on flowing water waved at me tirelessly suggesting matching the lake shores. \n\
  \u201C Look boy, don\u2019t you see lets go there; this is my first time to reach\
  \ near the lake. \u201CHe said   \u201CI have never seen flowing water like that\
  \ other than in bathroom, and I have to grab my chance by now.\u201D\nWe agreed\
  \ on the deal and jump off the fence to reach the city suburb center around. Steve\
  \ who was a very curious guy, who enjoy coming up with new challenges and stuffs\
  \ in the environment.  Like me as the driven purpose in journalism of uncovering\
  \ the abnormal things that have never existed or presenting in, the normal in with\
  \ another shape help me to feed and satisfy my greediness of curiosity.\nReaching\
  \ on the riverside, sailors were in abundant and persuading people to pay for a\
  \ trip in water, which I was not able to refute. I looked at a well equipped ship\
  \ as it was my first glance at a material like that. I wanted to ask him some basic\
  \ knowledge and the logic behind the phenomenon of having the ship sliding over\
  \ the waves of water full of big number of people with their luggage without sinking.\n\
  The journey that was my memorable one as it was my first time to reach in the middle\
  \ of two countries became my motivation of quenching my thirst of discovering new\
  \ stuff in my eyes and mind.  From that day in 2014 , I have became the man of travelling\
  \ especially , with my passion in journalism career  , where I  normally take trips\
  \ for the sake of  having some controversial situation that endangers people\u2019\
  s lives and make them heard by their authorities"
