Text: "I pedaled my bike down a footpath away from the high school and I thought freedom.\
  \ \n\nI rode towards my home on Lelu and considered the history of freedom on the\
  \ island of Kosrae. Lelu was once home to the King and Queen of Kosrae. The large\
  \ volcanic stones of the former palace are over grown with vines and the roots of\
  \ large banyan trees, tucked behind the only store on island where I purchase most\
  \ of my groceries and  supplies for my classroom \u2013Ace Hardware. I pedaled and\
  \ pondered how the island has evolved throughout the course of colonization, westernization,\
  \ and war. From traditional beliefs that built the palace to the protestant ones\
  \ that tore the palace down, the Kosraeans were saved by Jesus. Later after WWII\
  \ when American soldiers rid Kosrae of the Japanese occupation, the Kosraeans found\
  \ a second savior in Uncle Sam.   \n\nI road across the causeway connecting the\
  \ main island to Lelu taking deep inhales of salty air. I turned my attention forward\
  \ to wave and smile back at a white Japanese cargo truck whose bed was packed with\
  \ students greeting me with shouts of, \u201CHello!\u201D or \u201CGood-bye!\u201D\
  . I shouted back, \u201CLwenwo!\u201D and \u201CFah ason!\u201D I glanced at Lelu\
  \ Marina, thought about buying a tuna, and my mind flitted briefly to the WWII ship\
  \ and plane wrecks I had explored SCUBA diving down in the murky harbor. \n\nI pulled\
  \ into the sandy drive-way of my Kosraean grandmother's house to stop to say hello\
  \ on my way home. I leaned my bike against a coconut tree and glanced at a rusted\
  \ tank across the road being consumed by Jurassic sized jungle leaves and vines.\
  \ I walked inside the pink house and she greeted me in a friendly manner by immediately\
  \ offering me a drinking coconut. I accepted the coconut gladly in one hand while\
  \ wiping off the rivers of sweat cascading down my brow with the other hand. I looked\
  \ at the American flag hung on the inside of the front door and at the picture of\
  \ one of N\u2019acmata\u2019s sons in military uniform hung on the wall. Uncle Sam\
  \ gladly welcomes Micronesians into his ranks. I sat on the floor next to N\u2019\
  acamata and we each briefly chatted about our days until the thick mid-afternoon\
  \ humidity made even chatting laborious and we both began to doze. \n\nHalf-asleep\
  \ sitting on the laminated floor, I contemplated how when I arrived on the island\
  \ of Kosrae to teach English, I expected to make a difference. I expected sandy\
  \ beaches and coconuts. What I didn\u2019t expect was how closely American freedom\
  \ is linked to a remote Pacific Island in Micronesia."
