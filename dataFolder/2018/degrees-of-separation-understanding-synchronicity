Text: "Estelle had been my friend in my head for years. Seven to be exact. At the\
  \ age of 14, I discovered her via an unscripted series about the Black experience\
  \ in Paris. Later, as I embarked on my third journey to France, it all clicked.\
  \ \n \nChatelet. Garibaldi. St-Denis. Over a 33-minute train ride, we had more than\
  \ enough time to bond. In the midst of expressing her excitement about taking me\
  \ to the grand opening of a bakery, she abruptly mentioned that she had to contact\
  \ her boyfriend.\n\n\u201CHuh?\u201D My thought clearly manifested into a puzzled\
  \ expression. This was odd because she mentioned him a couple of minutes prior.\
  \ I didn\u2019t understand the urgency to speak with him.\n         \nNoting my\
  \ confusion, she laughed and casually proclaimed, \u201CI have two boyfriends. They\
  \ know each other.\u201D The juxtaposition between my perception of her internet\
  \ persona versus her reality was astounding. From her interviews, I would have never\
  \ arrived at this conclusion. Estelle was the pictorial representation of what society\
  \ expects women to be. At least on the surface. She was well-spoken, charming, educated\
  \ and multilingual. The world as she knew it was disrupted at the age of 15 upon\
  \ discovering that her devout Catholic father had begun a family with a mistress.\
  \ How do you react when the structure you took to be the absolute truth turns out\
  \ to be anything but the truth? Estelle was forced to redefine her BS . . . belief\
  \ system, that is. For this reason, she didn\u2019t consider having two lovers and\
  \ being a sex worker to afford college as a mark against her character. Without\
  \ a doubt, I identified with her.\n \nI met Estelle during a 10-day solo trip to\
  \ Paris while studying abroad in Florence. Of course, life would be alluring as\
  \ I lived in the land of Michelangelo . . . right? In hindsight, meeting her sparked\
  \ a metamorphosis, as Kafka would describe it.\n \nI was once the scholar who studied\
  \ abroad on a yearly basis. To be frank, the experiential resonates with me more\
  \ so than academia. I had to define who I wanted to be. I was no longer able to\
  \ hide behind labels. I concluded that I was in a battle with myself because my\
  \ mind guided me rather than my heart. I\u2019m not exactly the person you envision\
  \ when describing the ideal citizen - mocha skin, platinum blonde hair, paired with\
  \ red lips. I wasn't designed to conform. I was told to get a \u201Creal job\u201D\
  \ rather than commit my life to my passion - travel.\n\nEstelle had evolved; I was\
  \ evolving. The torch was passing. The stars aligned for us to meet."
