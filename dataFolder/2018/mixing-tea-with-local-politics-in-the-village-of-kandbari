Text: "Living in a toxic city such as Delhi has the potential to decimate your mental\
  \ health. Waking up every day in a city where pollution levels have been declared\
  \ an emergency does something to your ability to function. One day, I had enough\
  \ of inhaling smog with every breath I took. I packed my bag, googled a place with\
  \ horrible network, ensuring that I would not be spending unnecessary time on social\
  \ media and negotiated with my boss for a leave. \n\nAn all-night bus ride brought\
  \ me to the isolated village of Kandbari, in the state of Himachal Pradesh, located\
  \ in the middle of a small forest and stream. The place I opted to stay in was Sambhaavna\
  \ Institute, a development based institute to aid the villagers in organic self-sustenance.\n\
  \ \nThe entire village of Kandbari had just experienced elections. The political\
  \ atmosphere in the village was abuzz, from old flags rooted to the thatched yellow\
  \ roofs of the houses, to party flags firmly rooted in the barks of coniferous trees\
  \ and little moats littered with pamphlets comprising the never-ending false promises\
  \ politicians made to the villagers. Little children would pick up fallen flags\
  \ and run around the hillside, waving them and occasionally stopping to pose when\
  \ I whipped out my camera. \n\nA long walk up a winding road between lush green\
  \ hillsides brought me to a little hut that sold piping hot tea with cardamom and\
  \ ginger. The owner was a friendly but stern man in his eighties who saw blue streaks\
  \ in my hair and immediately launched into a sermon about hair care while serving\
  \ me tea.\n \nSaid blue streaks were enough for a small group to gather around me.\
  \ However, a few minutes later, we were back to the talk of the town: the elections.\
  \ The teashop owner and his wife bitterly lamented what \u2018development\u2019\
  \ had done to their beautiful village over the years. A middle-aged woman recounted\
  \ that she had taken her revenge on the ruling party by voting for the opposition,\
  \ as her son in the army had been posted in a conflict zone. A younger man in the\
  \ group was fretting about the austerity of the party who could win, affecting his\
  \ access to alcohol. However, everyone was united on how they could see through\
  \ every politician\u2019s never-ending declarations of \u2018progress\u2019 and\
  \ \u2018benefits\u2019 like glass.\n\nThe entitled urban person spends too much\
  \ of their time making assumptions about those in rural communities and how aware\
  \ they are. An assumption that can be very easily broken, if only we bothered to\
  \ reach out more often and talk."
