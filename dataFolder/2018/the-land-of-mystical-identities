Text: "The owner of my verbal feelings finally spoke up: \u201CYou need to run away.\u201D\
  \ Fighting with those constant beams onto my head, I opened the cupboard, packed\
  \ a light bag and just clicked my being to transport to another land where no one\
  \ knows me. \nMy destination marked the name \u201CGokarna\u201D, a pretty small\
  \ place eminently known for its beaches. The creative mystery that lies hidden behind\
  \ the beaches is the sand formation for each beach makes a separate identity. I\
  \ knew my identity needs a name too, and I gathered my particles to find solace\
  \ in the land of mystical sunrises and sunsets. \nApparently, such places are quiet\
  \ and let nature utter the sound of calmness. I needed it. On the way to Gokarna,\
  \ I simply booked a place with a private beach on Airbnb. I knew something was different\
  \ about the place. On arrival, I was welcomed by the warmth of the Russian couple\
  \ who owned the place. Shocked as bits to acknowledge they were not the only ones\
  \ but the beach was full of shacks with numerous other Russian families. My shack\
  \ was a cute little abode with an utterly cozy bed and no fans. When I relaxed my\
  \ being, I heard the majestic waves just crumbling onto the shore and murmuring\
  \ the sweetest enchants I have ever heard. I rushed to the sea and found a long\
  \ stretch of sand spread across a cutless land. My mind spoke to me after a long\
  \ time, my nerves started reacting and I had the most pleasant smile and with each\
  \ breath I was reminded of how alluring something can be. \nThey invited me for\
  \ breakfast. Some yogasinis were practising yoga with their flexible feet and arms\
  \ rotating almost 360 degree and some were busy chanting the \u201COm\u201D sholakas.\
  \ Surprisingly, I looked at the vegan breakfast and I was sure these days are going\
  \ to lead me somewhere. I sat across a little bridge and talked to a few families\
  \ for hours about their lifestyle and how dance brought them here. Delighted and\
  \ mesmerised as I was, I simultaneously didn\u2019t miss the amber sky turning orangish\
  \ like a pinch of turmeric applied on all my wounds. I felt relaxed, eased out and\
  \ crumble-free. As the night proclaimed, they gathered a few wooden sticks to set\
  \ them on fire and went on to praise Lord Shiva for almost 2 hours. Closed my eyes,\
  \ synced with them and heard the moon playing with sparkling waves. \nThat night,\
  \ I had a bunch of strange land people embellished with Indian God hymns, I had\
  \ the sea to overlook and I had myself. That moment, I knew I was at the right place."
