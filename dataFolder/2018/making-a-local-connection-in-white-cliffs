Text: "\u201CMaking a Local Connection in White Cliffs\u201D   \n\n'Where did you\
  \ say you've been?  Did you say Bill's place?  He played what for you?'  Alice,\
  \ the cafe owner's wife, seemed perplexed as she lifted her head from preparing\
  \ an extravagant breakfast for us on our last morning in White Cliffs. \n\nIn a\
  \ running dialogue on where we'd been over the past 4 days, waiting for yet another\
  \ 'John' to finish welding our HiLux \u2013 'John' was the name of almost every\
  \ male in town after word got out Noel was with Child Support -  I mentioned  that\
  \ we'd been listening to Bill \u2013 the diesel engineer who ran tours of the solar\
  \ energy farm at White Cliffs \u2013 playing 'Smoke Gets in Your Eyes' on his electronic\
  \ saxophone in one of the many-level rooms of their home, a former opal mine.  \n\
  \nStopping her preparations, she continued, 'Are we talking about the same Bill\
  \ who's married to Jane and lives up the side of the hill in the old mine, under\
  \ the dam and airfield on top of the hill?' \n\nI confirmed that this was indeed\
  \ the same Bill who had invited us to visit for an hour yesterday afternoon to meet\
  \ his wife and to look at their handiwork:  the eighteen year old mine they had\
  \ worked hard to make into a delightful underground home over the past few years,\
  \ after retiring from work in Sydney. \n\nHer husband, making our much desired cappuccinos,\
  \ added  'We've never heard Bill play anything here in White Cliffs and definitely\
  \ not in their home, as far as I can recall, and I hear rumoured that only one person\
  \ in town has been allowed the privilege of seeing the inside of their underground\
  \ home.'\n\n'Yes, I believe you're right on all counts!' Alice confirmed, adding,\
  \ 'Possibly he plays elsewhere -  they often do go down to family in Broken Hill\
  \ as Jane restores old dolls, so she visits the Doll Hospital there'.  \n\nShe went\
  \ on to ask, 'Did you show Jane the tiny porcelain doll's hand you found up by the\
  \ old graves on top of the hill?'  \n\nNodding in unison, we agreed with them that\
  \ it was for sure a worthwhile visit after all: we'd made a wonderful local connection.\
  \  \n\nNot only had we been astounded and inspired by the amount of effort Bill\
  \ and Jane had expended in designing and building their underground home, with its\
  \ sunken lounge, spiral staircase and minature framed opal mine, we were privileged\
  \ to be the only ones to enjoy an exquisite rendition of Bill's favourite song.\
  \ Also, it seems we had helped to add another historically made and dressed doll\
  \ to Jane's extensive doll collection from early pioneer days."
