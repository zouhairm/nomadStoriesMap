Text: "It was all about a single view, a mission I had given myself that was dependent\
  \ on me reaching the top of Lone Cone mountain on Meares Island, where I witnessed\
  \ one of the most amazing sunrises of my life.\n\nMeares Island itself is a preserved\
  \ wilderness near Tofino, for a small island located in the Cloyquot Sound it has\
  \ a dramatic past, mostly known for being a place of successful protest against\
  \ deforestation. But the locals told me of it's darker history, as a home of the\
  \ Tla-o-qui-aht First Nation, they were targeted by missionaries during a time when\
  \ the church used forceful and cruel methods. Now reparations have been made and\
  \ the people have the land to themselves, running a small but well equipped campsite.\
  \ \n\nWhen stepping onto their dock I was greeted by a bright blue pickup truck\
  \ with the campsite\u2019s friendly big-foot mascot on the side, I was invited to\
  \ climb into the back and was then carried through the forest to their grounds.\
  \ It took some convincing for them to let me hike into the forest so late in the\
  \ evening, but I told them of my plans and showed them my equipment to appease their\
  \ concerns. We made an arrangement for contact to be made by a certain time the\
  \ next morning, failure to do so would mean they send out search and rescue. I was\
  \ comforted by their concern, but it also made me think I might have underestimated\
  \ the dangers on the island.\n\nI hiked up alone for 3 hours that evening, one hand\
  \ constantly clenching my bear spray, pushing myself to summit before sundown. I\
  \ made it, drenched in sweat and hungrier than my food supplies could satiate. I\
  \ promptly set up camp and went to bed, choosing between laying in my damp camping\
  \ gear or being exposed and attacked by mosquitos. My goal was simple, a sunrise\
  \ shot of the islands around Tofino in golden hour with their long shadows streaking\
  \ across the waters. \n\nHowever, when I awoke I had a totally different view.\n\
  \nI was lying atop my own private island in a sea of clouds, the rivers and ocean\
  \ had disappeared. The shot I planned for was impossible, but I was dealt something\
  \ far greater and much more memorable. The swirling sea of cloud cover below me\
  \ kept everyone underneath in shadow, but above I alone could see the symphony of\
  \ colours dancing over the peaks in front of me as the sun rose.\n\nWhat excites\
  \ me most about travel is the unexpected experiences that shape the adventure. The\
  \ wanderlust mindset pushes you to do and see more, which leads to crazy goals and\
  \ even crazier rewards."
