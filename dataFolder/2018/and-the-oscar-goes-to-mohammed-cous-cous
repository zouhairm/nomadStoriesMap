Text: "After days of navigating the city\u2019s labyrinths we stepped down into another\
  \ shop. No one was inside.\nThick carpets covered the floor. Several hung on the\
  \ wall. Chess sets and leather goods were for sale. Then someone came in behind\
  \ us.\n\n\u201CHello! My name is Muhammad Cous-Cous\u201D, he bellowed in a deep,\
  \ booming voice that sounded like James Earl Jones. It echoed in the room like a\
  \ muezzin's call to prayer. \n\nHis bushy beard was dark brown with streaks of grey.\
  \ Blue robes flowed behind him as he slowly descended the small staircase. His arrival\
  \ had the deliberate drama of an Old Hollywood starlet. \n\n\u201CWelcome to my\
  \ shop! I am so blessed to have you. Please choose gifts\u201D. He extending his\
  \ arms open with a graceful turn. To our left was a small ornate table. A pot of\
  \ mint tea was steaming in the middle. \n\nI decided on leather sandals. My girlfriend\
  \ chose a bag decorated with geometric motifs. Me and Muhammad sat down on red pillows\
  \ and he poured me some tea. Or as he jokingly called it, \u201CBerber whiskey\u201D\
  .\n\n\u201CYou are a wonderful man. Look at how blessed you are. What\u2019s your\
  \ name?\u201D, he asked with a smile.\n\n\u201CMy name is Rich\u201D, I replied,\
  \ \u201CHer name is Sandy.\u201D\n\n\u201COoh! You are lucky man. She is like Miss\
  \ America!\u201C, he teased.\n\nHe deepened his voice and said \u201CNow. How much\
  \ will you pay Muhammad for these things. $100 American dollars?\u201D. \n\nI nodded\
  \ my chin towards the piece of paper he was holding. It was time to barter. He moved\
  \ the paper across the table very slowly as if we were conducting a secret arms\
  \ deal. I never knew purchasing flip flops could be so exciting. I crossed out his\
  \ opening offer and put 650 dirhams. He looked and yelled \u201CBut we are friends!\u201D\
  . I could see a cherub-like smile hidden in his big beard. We both clearly enjoyed\
  \ the negotiations. He finally wrote down $60 and slide the paper back to me. I\
  \ stared at the paper and hesitated for dramatic effect, then poured more tea into\
  \ his glass as a response. \n\nHe broke out in laughter and we shook hands in agreement.\
  \ \u201COh, thank you so much. You really are a good friend to Muhammad!\u201D.\
  \ He was mischievously grinning and his cheeks glowed rosy red like an Arab Santa\
  \ Claus. He sat there in his beautiful blue Tuareg robes beaming with pride.\n\n\
  \u201CDo you stay long in Marrakech?\u201D, he asked. \n\n\u201CWe leave tonight.\u201D\
  \n\n\u201CWhen you come back to Morocco I show you my family.\u201D\n\nI looked\
  \ at him with honest eyes: \u201CI hope so Muhammad. Will there be mint tea?\u201D\
  \ \n\n\u201CYes. It is our way\u201D, he said. \n\nMeeting him was the ultimate\
  \ souvenir."
