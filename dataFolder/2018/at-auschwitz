Text: "At Auschwitz, tourists were wandering with solemnity, real or feigned, among\
  \ grainy photographs and the boots and watch chains of a lost past. Nick felt an\
  \ urge to shout obscenities into the hush. Across the other side of the warehouse,\
  \ Amy was standing alone, a tiny dark-haired figure among the artefacts, unapproachable\
  \ in her quiet absorption. They had only met two days ago in the hostel in Krakow.\
  \ She was planning to take a train to Berlin at the weekend, but Nick was going\
  \ to Prague.\nHe saw a photograph of false teeth, and he stared at it, inviting\
  \ the moment of catharsis, but it was only teeth. He continued to stare, waiting\
  \ for something to occur out of simple duration.\nA voice said, \u2018It\u2019s\
  \ just impossible to believe, isn\u2019t it? I just can\u2019t... you know...\u2019\
  \n\u2018Yeah.\u2019 He looked at the lady, who might have been German, or Dutch\
  \ perhaps. Her voice was so distorted, it was as if she wanted to cry but was not\
  \ able to.\n\u2018It\u2019s unbelievable.\u2019 He felt an urge to smile, and turned\
  \ away to look at a different photograph. He saw a broken railway line with grass\
  \ growing over the tracks. He stared until it was just a geometrical formation;\
  \ lines and shapes. \nHe needed to speak to Amy, but he could only think of grass,\
  \ how it spread and filled duration, a blanketing patience. As he approached, he\
  \ saw that she was agitated, and he was afraid to intrude upon her private emotion,\
  \ but he had to say something. He tried, \u2018Intense, huh?\u2019 \n\u2018You won\u2019\
  t believe this,\u2019 Amy said.\n\u2018What?\u2019\n'Don't look, okay, but that\
  \ guy, over in the corner, is Ricky Lee.\u2019\n\u2018Who...?\u2019 Nick looked\
  \ at the man. There was something recognisable there, beneath the layers of age\
  \ and waste. \u2018He was a pop star, like fifteen years ago? Of course. Ricky Lee.\
  \ I hated that guy. My sister was so obsessed, she used to listen to the same song\
  \ for hours, over and over.\u2019\n\u2018It's like you\u2019re describing my lost\
  \ innocence.\u2019 She touched his arm. \u2018We have to talk to him.\u2019\n\u2018\
  I\u2019m not sure that's appropriate.\u2019 \n\u2018You don\u2019t know what it\
  \ was like to be in love with Ricky Lee.\u2019 \nNick felt her hand clutching his\
  \ wrist. God, she was beautiful. \u2018You\u2019re right,\u2019 he said. \u2018\
  We have to talk to him.\u2019\nThey crept towards the far corner, and the figure\
  \ standing there. \u2018What's he doing?\u2019 Tasha whispered.\n\u2018I don't know.'\n\
  \u2018We have to get closer.\u2019\n'Wait.' Nick stopped. 'Look: I think he's crying.'\
  \ The man, whoever he was, was shuddering under the impact of some powerful force.\
  \ The corner seemed so far away that the distance could never be crossed."
