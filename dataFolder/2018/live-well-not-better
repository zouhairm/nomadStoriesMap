Text: When you talk about traveling to Mexico, you think about the beaches, the parties,
  spring break, and lots of tequila, but there's so much more to Mexico than all-inclusive
  resorts and hidden cenotes. I had the pleasure of partnering with Hard Rock and
  Why Hunger to travel to Oaxaca, Mexico and visit the indigenous people of the Sierra
  Juarez mountain range to see how they sustain a living in their small community
  of 25 families. Our drive from Oaxaca City to Talea de Castro was a long one, filled
  with winding and bumpy roads. We started the evening with a walk around the small
  village with 2,500 people and ended it with dinner at the local diner (which was
  a dinner table at someone's house). The following morning we traveling into the
  valley to a small community with only 25 families. They greeted us with open arms
  and started the day off with a ceremony. You raise your arms up and give thanks
  to the west, east, north and finally south, you then give thanks to the earth by
  giving back all that you have grow. The beautiful hole in the ground, surrounded
  by flowers and candles was now the earth receiving corn, bread, fish, and even Mezcal.
  The people then taught me to live well, not better and I will never forget the smiles
  on their faces and how happy they were when they had nothing but each other.
