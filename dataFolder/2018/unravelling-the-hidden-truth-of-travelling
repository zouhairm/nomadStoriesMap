Text: "I have always wondered how people who do not have the fortune of being able\
  \ to travel, can find excitement and fulfilment in their lives. \n\nWhile I was\
  \ asking myself this question, I was handed the answer by the world.\n\n\u2026\n\
  \nHe threw me an open smile, as if shyness or self awareness where experiences foreign\
  \ to him. When one is overwhelmed by someone else's gesture, one cannot help but\
  \ answer in the same manner. \n\nI smiled. \n\n\u201CHello\u201D, he approached\
  \ me \u201CWhere do you come from?\u201D, he asked me in his broken english. \n\u201C\
  You can speak english?\u201D I replied, happily astonished.\n\u201CYes, I have a\
  \ Television\u201D.\n\nWe started talking to each other -within the limits of our\
  \ understanding. \n\nHe had a book in his hand and I asked him what it was about.\
  \ Astonished to hear his response, I found out the book was the Kama Sutra -which\
  \ instead of being a book on sexual positions, as I had thought, was a book of costume\
  \ and manners, telling ancient hindi society how to behave and what to do and not\
  \ to do. \u201C\u2026 you cannot  marry someone too tall or to short, to black or\
  \ too white, too wide or to slim\u201D, the book said. We laughed at the incongruity\
  \ of the text.  \n\nHis laugh was clear and loud, authentic, and it seemed to come\
  \ from a very clear spot within himself. \n\nWe started walking together the dusty\
  \ paths of Tilcara, passing through its sandy existence, through its streets constructed\
  \ of blocks of adobe, and across its calm people sitting at the door of their homes.\
  \ We started mixing the anecdotes of the book with anecdotes form our own lives,\
  \ and laughter and conversation took us well into the afternoon. And as the night\
  \ approached, and the brown tones of the houses started turning orangey, we lost\
  \ ourselves and even lost our words. There was an infinity of words inside us that\
  \ we did not need to speak. How you could feel so comfortable with a mere presence,\
  \ I did not understand.\n\nWhen we reached the square where we had met, he said\
  \ good-bye to me with a smile as open and spontaneous as the one he had thrown at\
  \ me when we had first met. \n\nI remember understanding that some people are like\
  \ travel, that you don\u2019t necessarily need to leave a place where you stay and\
  \ go on to another place  to travel. That traveling is leaving, metaphorically or\
  \ physically, your state of mind."
