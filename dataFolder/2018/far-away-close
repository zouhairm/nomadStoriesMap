Text: "\u201CIt is a beautiful building\u201D.\nThe old lady said it in a mumble.\
  \ Sitting on a wooden bench, with her flannel skirt and her tightly-buttoned green\
  \ pullover, she reminded me of an old museum article - she had a scent of long life.\n\
  \nWe stumbled upon her a lazy Sunday afternoon, during a car drive. Me and my friends,\
  \ N. and A., wanted to see if we could find some secret spots out of our hometown,\
  \ Modena.\n\nWhile driving, Emilia Romagna, our region, unraveled like a puzzle\
  \ with a limited set of pieces: groups of houses, fields, some factories, other\
  \ houses... The usual muddy air, the usual steel-colored, opaque sky, like a mirror\
  \ covered in vapor after a humid shower. Emilia Romagna. Worst weather.\n\nAfter\
  \ less than 30 minutes, the empty road led us to Stuffione, nothing more than a\
  \ sprinkle of buildings in the middle of nowhere. Everything was just being there,\
  \ immobile, like a switch longing to be turned on. Having actually \"found\" a new\
  \ place we had no idea about, we were elated by our discovery, and we started laughing\
  \ at how small and useless everything appeared.\n\nThen, on the right side of the\
  \ road, in front of the church, we saw the building, and our giggles stopped. It\
  \ was probably a school, maybe an ex State building. It was big, 3 or 4 floors,\
  \ each with a long raw of windows. A solid parallelepiped, painted in grey. But\
  \ something was altering that boring geometry: along the walls, on the frame of\
  \ the windows, in the dirty corners close to the roof - it was covered in cracks\
  \ and holes. The 2013 earthquake had hit Stuffione, as many other towns in the countryside\
  \ around Modena. And I had no idea. I didn\u2019t even know Stuffione was a place.\
  \ But it wasn\u2019t a place to find, a game of exploration. It was a living memento\
  \ of what had pushed my land on its knees.\n\nSuddenly, I saw the old lady, sitting\
  \ near the church. I felt embarrassed, guilty, a total idiot. How many of the stupid\
  \ things we said had she heard? How much suffering was she hiding behind that tightly-buttoned\
  \ green pullover? I wanted to redeem myself by saying something smart, or respectful,\
  \ but my mouth moved before my brain:\n\n\u201CThat must have been a beautiful building...\u201D\
  \nStupid mouth.\n\n\u201CIt is a beautiful building.\u201D\nThe old lady repeated\
  \ it, with a firmer voice this time, and in that moment I saw it in her: the resilience,\
  \ the courage, the grounded simplicity of the people of my homeland. I saw it all,\
  \ and I knew. Emilia Romagna. Worst weather, best people.\n\n\u201CIndeed it is.\u201D"
