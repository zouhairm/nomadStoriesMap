Text: "A warm sea lapped at her ankles. As she spun, lightning ignited the sky. For\
  \ the first time in days a warm breeze kept the mosquitoes at bay. We sat on edge\
  \ watching Alaena induce the next strike. \n\n\"It feels like we are in a Wes Anderson\
  \ film.\" A collective sigh murmured from our group. Rash decisions had got us this\
  \ far and were not of the mindset to brake our momentum.\n \nAcross the globe a\
  \ frigid cold dug its fingers into the heart of the Midwest. I buried my feet into\
  \ the sand and leaned back. We all traveled great distances to fulfill our oath\
  \ to meet and travel together. A quite giggle passed between us. The moment was\
  \ to grand to waste on idle banter.\n\nBehind us a late moon rose, it struck an\
  \ eerie shadow on the sea. I leaned back and took a deep swig of warm beer. We were\
  \ dirty, crusted in salt, our hair styles obnoxious, our bodies thin and strong\
  \ from barring the brunt of months traveling.\n \nThe moon pushed the storm farther\
  \ out to sea and illuminated the karsts hugging the bay. Alaena spun again and the\
  \ sky lit up. We burst out laughing; the type that triggers lasting friendship.\
  \ A cigarette quietly passed between us.   \n\nSlowly our friends slipped away into\
  \ the jungle. Alaena spun one last time. The waves were now lapping at my feet I\
  \ let them move up my thighs. I stood up smiling, we held hands and walked into\
  \ the darkness."
