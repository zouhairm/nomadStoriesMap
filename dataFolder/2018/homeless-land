Text: "\u201CIt\xB4s my turn to stay in the corner, get out!\u201D screamed the big\
  \ man from the other side.\nI get scared, looking at all sides trying to know what\
  \ to do.\nHe walks towards me furiously. Suddenly, he stops screaming to look at\
  \ my sign \"Homeless and sick\".\n\u201CWhat do you have?\u201D he asks.\n\u201C\
  My throat aches\u201D I respond desperately touching my neck. He took a few seconds\
  \ to examine me. Showing mercy, he answers \u201CI yield you my place\u201D.\nI\
  \ was confused, but I have to buy medicine. I sit in the basin and put a box on\
  \ the floor. Instantly, people start to throw money on it. Minutes later, the men\
  \ come back and give the place to another homeless.\n\u201CHow was it?\u201D he\
  \ asks.\n\u201CFine, I got enough money to eat and a gentleman bought me some medicine\u201D\
  \ I made an effort to talk clearly.\n\u201CBe careful. I helped you, but people\
  \ aren't kind and can be dangerous.\u201D He said giving some steps away from me.\n\
  \u201CDo you want to eat something?\u201D I said as hard as I could, \u201CI have\
  \ enough money for both of us\u201D.\n\u201CThere is a place where people like us\
  \ are welcome\u201D he says showing the way.\nThe name of that big black man was\
  \ Anthony. He was born in Florida, but he moves to New York to exploit his passion:\
  \ dance and rap. He wasn\xB4t lucky. He lost his job. The rent was expensive, and\
  \ the solution was to buy a campaign house to put all his thing inside. Since then\
  \ he was living in Washington DC as a homeless.\n\u201CIt isn\xB4t too bad to be\
  \ homeless. People bring me money to buy food. Some hotels let me take a shower\
  \ and, if I need clothes, there is a place of donations when the apparels are in\
  \ good condition. I can show you where, if you want it\u201D exclaimed while he\
  \ gives a bite of the pizza.\nI decline indifferent.\n\u201CWhat is your story?\
  \ You look too silly to be a real homeless\u201D said with irony.\n\u201CI was traveling\
  \ but, someone stole my backpack. They took my phone and all of my cash. I slept\
  \ on a bench in the park and it was cold, that's why I\xB4m sick. I only want to\
  \ get enough money to buy a bus ticket and come back home\u201D I couldn\u2019t\
  \ hide how worry I was.\n\u201CI can show you how to move in this neighborhood to\
  \ get some money, but you have to reward me before\u201D He stands up from the chair\
  \ ready to leave.\nAs a travel guide, he shows me the best corners to get some money\
  \ and teach me how to avoid troubles.\n\u201CYou can stay the night in my campaign\
  \ house\u201D he offered.\n \u201CI have too much to figure out, I don't know if\
  \ I can sleep\u201D I said.\n\u201CWho's talking about sleep? You have to reward\
  \ me, remember?\u201D he answers, putting a flirtatious smile."
