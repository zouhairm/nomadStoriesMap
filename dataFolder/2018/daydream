Text: "My vision focuses once I blink away the grey spots that litter the screen.\
  \ The logo appears: a fluffy cloud with the title Daydream underneath in tiny blue\
  \ font. Then, I am just off a dirt path of a concrete tourism site. I don\u2019\
  t recognise it right away, with my latest additions updated. The cliffs are foggy,\
  \ and the ocean slams violently at the lavender rock below. Unfamiliar to my own\
  \ coding, I reenter the program, moving my head side to side in  large, sweeping\
  \ movements. Its sensitivity, dependent on the positioning of the goggles to the\
  \ console on the floor, calls for a sort of emphasised quality specific to live\
  \ theatre or Bugs Bunny sketches. \nHaving left this world to hang suspended in\
  \ my termination, the revived park seems larger than its original muse; the waves\
  \ rougher, the fall steeper, and the edges where rock meets the ocean, more clouded.\
  \ I suppose since my last suggestions, they upped the definition and added more\
  \ details, like seagulls fighting and parking tickets flipping through the wind\
  \ every so often. \nAs I turn my head to the left, I hear a small humming, though\
  \ I don\u2019t recall turning the speakers on. I lean my body forward, pushing past\
  \ the mist that coats the air, down to a stoney staircase; on one side of the rail\
  \ is a plaque that reads Cliffs of Moher, 52.9719\xB0 N, 9.4265\xB0 W, and on the\
  \ other, an empty parking lot.\nI turn my head once more, flipping my body around\
  \ to lay nearly entirely flat, face down in the cushion. Looking down at the bottom\
  \ step, there is a weathered, old street performer, singing and playing an accordion\
  \ hidden under a rain poncho that has a large four leaf clover on the back. The\
  \ only features that stick out from the yellow poncho are his grey eyebrows and\
  \ his only slightly hairy chin, pinkened by the cold. He mumbles some lines, but\
  \ the chords he pulls along to his tapping heel keeps me on track as he sings under\
  \ his hood, \u201Cand it\u2019s no, nay, never, no, nay, never no more\u201D. \n\
  \u201COy,\u201D I call to him through the wind. \u201CYou take requests?\u201D His\
  \ tune doesn\u2019t skip a beat. He must not have heard me."
