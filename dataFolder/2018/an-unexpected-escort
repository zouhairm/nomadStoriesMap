Text: "The essence of travel, the thing that makes it so addicting to those who step\
  \ outside the dangerously mundane doors of routine, is the pure exhilaration that\
  \ comes from the unknown. These are the beautifully overwhelming feelings that came\
  \ to my friend Anya and I in Rishikesh, India in 2014.\n\nGrowing up in a small\
  \ Canadian town, when we said we were going to India, we were met with exactly the\
  \ comments you\u2019d expect from a blue-collar crowd. Those who don\u2019t know\
  \ much outside Alberta backroads, and the ratio of gas to oil needed in off-road\
  \ vehicles. And while India is a different ball game, we were delighted to discover\
  \ that instead of the alleged stones to be thrown our way, we were met with curious\
  \ glances and photo requests. Threats that could be combatted by a friendly wave\
  \ - returned by toothy smiles, and cheerful head wags.\n\nOne draw to Rishikesh,\
  \ aside from the Himalayas, unspoiled start of the Ganges River, and dirty hippies\
  \ that made Jeff Lebowski look hygienic, was the Chaurasi Kutia Ashram of Maharishi\
  \ Mahesh. Famously visited by the Beatles in 1968, and inspiration for much of the\
  \ White album, this was a must see for us. We made our way there early in the day\
  \ following vague instructions from a guide book, and a pleasant local who gave\
  \ us the discernible directions of \u201Cuh\u2026straighty\u2026righty\u2026lefty.\u201D\
  \n\nA derelict back alley led us to an empty field, and finally the lush Indian\
  \ jungle. As we neared the tree edge, a young Indian man materialized in front us\
  \ wearing only a sarong, one string of white and orange beads, and a mouthful of\
  \ green teeth from chewing on tobacco leaves. With no words, English or otherwise,\
  \ he motioned for us to follow him, and without a second thought, we did.\n\nThe\
  \ following two hours were spent with our barefoot guide leading us through the\
  \ overgrown ashram, taking our photo with Anya\u2019s Nikon DLR camera which we\
  \ willingly handed over upon request, and a series of hugs which were so tight they\
  \ were at once wildly uncomfortable, and genuinely endearing. \n\nOnly once did\
  \ threads of doubt begin to creep into our minds, as we were shown into an abandoned\
  \ building and up a crumbling staircase. Were we about to prove every small-town\
  \ bigot right? But no, and even when I offered money at the end of our adventure\
  \ he was so appalled, I couldn\u2019t put it away fast enough.\n\nThe last thing\
  \ I expected that day was to be led through an abandoned Ashram by a shirtless Indian\
  \ man, but I am so grateful he proved every travel stereotype wrong."
