Text: "Gilly sells oysters in Kingston, Jamaica. His establishment is located on a\
  \ medium-sized patch of dirt on the side of a roundabout, with three offshoot roads;\
  \ one road leads to Kingston\u2019s main airport, one to the coast and the other\
  \ into a residential area. It is almost as if Gilly bridges these worlds of land,\
  \ air and sea with his modest oyster stall consisting of one bare long rectangular\
  \ table, a long continuous bench for seating, small coal grill and a short strand\
  \ of fluorescent bulbs for lighting attached to a car battery. \nBut even though\
  \ the word modest describes the size of his venture, do not let that word lead you\
  \ into a false sense of the man himself. Gilly is an imposing figure with his protruding\
  \ abdomen and muscular build, matched by his loud laugh and booming voice. If allowed,\
  \ he will regale you with stories of where he caught the oysters, how long he has\
  \ been selling them and how he got started in his business. And it does help if\
  \ you buy him an ice-cold Guinness. In between the stories, he will introduce you\
  \ to his family which includes his children, grandchildren, nieces, nephews and\
  \ even the neighbours\u2019 kids who help him to catch, clean and shuck the oysters\
  \ and help keep the area sanitary. \nHis best stories are his boasts about the many\
  \ children he has helped others bring into this world due to the aphrodisiac potency\
  \ of his love potion number 9, his signature oyster punch. He will point to customers\
  \ who he proudly proclaims that he has helped them to conceive, who just as proudly\
  \ confirm it\u2019s veracity. This elixir of life is a simple blend of raw oysters\
  \ and spices that is legendary in his little alcove and to those in the know, for\
  \ the virility and vitality it imbues. His customers come from all walks of life\
  \ and ethnicities. Police officers, doctors, businessmen and construction workers\
  \ all sit down together at Gilly\u2019s stall to share in one of the few things\
  \ that can bring people together, good food. He is a fisher among men, literally\
  \ and metaphorically, as his customers flock to him every night from 10pm until\
  \ 2am or when the oysters run out. They come for the ambiance, for the love of oysters,\
  \ looking for a place to kick start their night of partying or to finish it off\
  \ with a snack and some for that good old oyster punch in anticipation of the wonders\
  \ to come.\nIt is this sense of oneness which keeps me coming back to this patch\
  \ at the side of a roundabout, a respite from the circle we all sometimes find ourselves\
  \ trapped in."
