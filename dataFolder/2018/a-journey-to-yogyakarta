Text: "Changed is the word to describe my journey to Yogyakarta in 2008. At that time\
  \ I just came back from London after finishing my study.  I got accepted as an employee\
  \ in Indonesia national oil company and was assigned to Yogyakarta a city in central\
  \ java. Moving to Yogyakarta was a hard decision for me to take but yet intriguing.\
  \ \n\nThis was my first time to Yogyakarta, a small town in the middle of java\u2019\
  s island. I never like a small town as I grew up in Jakarta, and went study to London.\
  \ Yogyakarta is one of remaining kingdoms that still governed by a king in Indonesia.\
  \ The kingdom was built in 1755. When I arrived in Yogyakarta I was placed at the\
  \ company\u2019s house which was an old house with a big yard and rather spooky.\
  \ \nA week before I start working I decided to explore this new place, so I rented\
  \ a car, bought  a local map, and drove for about 1,5 hours to Magelang just a little\
  \ north outside Yogyakarta where Borobudur the world\u2019s largest Buddhist temple\
  \ on the Dieng Plateau date from the 7th and 8th centuries, located. It started\
  \ at 5.35 Am I climbed the top of Borobudur to witness a beautiful sunset.\n \n\
  After that I joined the retreat program for inner transformation to explore my deepest\
  \ level of consciousness. The retreat incorporated of meditation, yoga, Javanese\
  \ Shaman healing, astrology, and signature spa treatments. \nWhile in Magelang I\
  \ made a stop to rafting at Lower Progo River it allocated for more challenging\
  \ adventurers and only open in the rainy season. The trip was taken 3 hours for\
  \ 25 kilometers long with extremely adrenaline rush. \nAfter meditating and cooling\
  \ down, Gunung Kidul was my next destination. I went to Wohkudu beach, it was located\
  \ between two coral reefs and a small front beach, and it was a hidden treasure\
  \ for beach lovers.\n \nOn my way to Wohkudu I stopped for lunch at small but cozy\
  \ restaurant owned by an old lady. She was serving a lunch while telling me a story\
  \ about her children that never come back home. How she was lonely, old and living\
  \ alone but she had to work to support herself. From the lady I take a lesson that\
  \ life should be enjoyed not complained.\nThe meditation taught me to be calm in\
  \ all situations. The rafting brought me a reality that life is like a stream but\
  \ once you have done it will lead you to calm water. And the beach told me no matter\
  \ what you do in life bad or good God is always there to forgive. Yogyakarta, to\
  \ me was an extraordinary journey that changed the way I see, do and most of live\
  \ the life."
