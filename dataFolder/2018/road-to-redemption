Text: "The feverish rhythm and bass of bollywood sounded ahead, beating the tanned\
  \ dust from the earth and drumming my ears faintly in the back seat. The music heralded\
  \ an approaching bus, rounding the hairpin ahead, painted like ours, in waves of\
  \ psychedelic seas. Our \u2018bus conductor\u2019 continued: \"Now ladies and gentlemen\u201D\
  , his broken but \u2018proper\u2019 BBC english addressing the tourists amidst the\
  \ locals, \u201Cif you look up high to your right, you can make out very old Tamang\
  \ Gompa - monasteries for the Tamang\". \n\nStuck fast to the left window, bookstopping\
  \ a motley crew of cramped Nepalese, I could barely make out a window to my right,\
  \ much less the Gompa. \"...Aaand ladies and gentlemen, if you care to look down\
  \ now to your left...\" he took a long deliberate pause here - elderly skeletons\
  \ scoffing at this foreign facade, the nomadic babu to my right beaming - \u201C\
  ...you will see exactly nothing for one vertical kilometre\". He recounted the tourist\
  \ heads tilting back diagonally, smiled satisfactorily, and filed through for their\
  \ fares. Our teenage driver concentrated, the cliff-edged vacuum of nothingness\
  \ to his left, an impossibly narrow squeeze by the bus to his right.\n\nI peered\
  \ down, exploring common ground between the wheels and our lives. My heart erupted:\
  \ almost half the wheels\u2019 width hovered over the precipice! I leaned right\
  \ slowly, rubbing shoulders with the emaciated \u2018babu\u2019. The front wheel\
  \ skidded, then suddenly slipped a little, the whole bus tilting to the left. My\
  \ stomach clenched into a fist. Others began to panic. I glimpsed the babu\u2019\
  s bearded face: sublimely calm. Had he taken refuge in his gods? The Divine Protector\
  \ from Gruesome Road Carnage? Or was he simply oblivious to our situation? Either\
  \ way, both our realities tittered on the brink. I shut my eyes in submission, layers\
  \ of senses shutting further - into deep sanctuary. Festered memories stirred through\
  \ my paralysed body - prolonged tightrope-walks with death, vague scenes of an unforgotten\
  \ horror; extinguished in vitality and care, my numb mind lay in a bed-ridden body,\
  \ swirling in a black abyss, light-years from the world. \n\nAnd then the abyss\
  \ bottomed out. And from somewhere, that tiny ray of light punctured the darkness.\
  \ And familiar voices were heard again, echoing melodically as in a distant dream;\
  \ their faith instrumental for the first footholds and painstaking steps. And the\
  \ whole remainder of that enlightened path ahead, the babu to my right, still beaming."
