Text: "It was incredible rainy that day, a bit cold and misty, I couldn\xB4t see beyond\
  \ two meters and I end completely wet just for crossing the street from the bus\
  \ to the other side of the road. I cover myself under a roof and a woman approach\
  \ to me. We started to talk while waiting for the rain to stop and she asked if\
  \ I need accommodation, on which I reply I already booked a place. We walked together\
  \ along the way to the Hostel and she invited me to see the crafts she sells on\
  \ the shop next to it.  \nMama Vu is native from the tribe Hmong Black, and like\
  \ other woman\u2019s do, that day she was looking for tourists that need a guide\
  \ to hike the mountains of Sa Pa and offering them homestay to experience the local\
  \ life. The main reason I traveled more than 300 kilometres, from the big city of\
  \ Hanoi to North Vietnam, was to discover this trekking-hiking routes. What I didn\u2019\
  t expect is that this trip was also going to be an inflection point in my life.\
  \ \nI\xB4m curious by nature and after got impressed by the original crafts this\
  \ woman show me, I asked her for a different kind of homestay. I wanted not just\
  \ live with her family but also volunteer helping her designing and making the things\
  \ she sells. It could sound weird but this kind of things can happened when you\
  \ are traveling. \nDay after we walked and hiked mountains for over 21 kilometres\
  \ crossing incredible landscapes, waterfalls, tea plantations, to get to her house\
  \ where I end living more than expected. From that remote house in the middle of\
  \ nowhere, surrounded by rice plantation terraces, I create a social project for\
  \ the village and started my own online business. This allow me to keep traveling\
  \ for another year while doing the same in other countries. So I\xB4m incredibly\
  \ grateful for the rain that day."
