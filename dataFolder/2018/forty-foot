Text: "For fifteen summers my days were spent bouncing myself off of a three meter\
  \ diving board into thirteen feet of cool, clear, chlorinated water. Jump after\
  \ jump my friends and I never got tired of our Olympic-sized swimming pool in Pocantico\
  \ Hills, New York. The exhilaration never waned and those ninety-degree summer days\
  \ begged us to dive in.\n  At ten years old an undeniable sense of invincibility\
  \ is wrapped so tightly around our minds that we don\u2019t think, we just do. Those\
  \ moments of power and strength often trail off and disappear among second-guesses\
  \ and what-ifs; but I made it my mission to never let it go.\n This mission was\
  \ tested when I found myself, at twenty-one years old, staring into the choppy,\
  \ navy blue seas of the Dublin Bay. The chilled, Irish summer sun trapped my body\
  \ in goosebumps as Anna and I shivered trying to convince ourselves that this was\
  \ a better post-work activity than getting pints with the rest of our team. Forty\
  \ Foot, an outcrop in the seaside neighborhood of Dun Laighaire, is where the Irish,\
  \ no matter the season and no matter the temperature, plunge into the frigid bay.\n\
  \ Kids of all ages were climbing the crag. Grasping the iron railing, they giggled\
  \ through their Irish brogues as speedo clad men, older than my father, dove head\
  \ first through the air. So we went for it.\n \u201CThree!\u201D\n \u201CTwo!\u201D\
  \ \n \u201COne!\u201D\n Through a salt coated smile, the air was torn from my throat\
  \ as my body burned. I transported to the edge of that diving board. The view of\
  \ the bottom of the pool was what made my early jumps back home easy; I knew that\
  \ my feet would shoot to the bottom and push my body back to the surface. But here,\
  \ with the what-ifs and second-guesses, I almost convinced myself not to take the\
  \ risk.\n As my laugh rang through the air I jumped at least five more times. Each\
  \ one with more eagerness and excitement than the last. As the water seemed to warm\
  \ and the sun continued to set, it became clear to me why James Joyce chose Forty\
  \ Foot as the setting for his novel \u201CUlysses.\u201D Always pushing myself over\
  \ the edge, whether I can see the bottom or not, in the words of Joyce, this is\
  \ \u201CMe. And me now.\u201D"
