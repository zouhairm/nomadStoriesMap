Text: "The soft patter of rain intensified to a dull roar as my backpack came unhinged\
  \ and careened off the towering cliff, disappearing into the misty abyss below.\
  \ Screeching my motorbike to a halt, I teetered precariously on the rocky precipice\
  \ and made an inventory of the bag\u2019s contents: clothes, cash, and - oh yes\
  \ - my passport. \n\nDeep within the rural, verdant mountains of Vietnam\u2019s\
  \ northernmost H\xE0 Giang Province, I was chasing scenery rumored to be the country\u2019\
  s most spectacular. But without a passport, and with visitors arriving days later,\
  \ I faced an ultimatum: turn back and miss the fabled M\xE3 P\xED L\xE8ng Pass or\
  \ forge ahead and deal with the consequences later. Cruising the winding roads to\
  \ clear my head, I didn\u2019t stop until the sun sank behind the gloomy horizon.\n\
  \nSheets of rain assaulting the window panes woke me up long before my alarm did.\
  \ Shivering inconsolably from the dampness seeping into my bones, I contemplated\
  \ the daunting journey ahead, or behind, me.\n\nSprinting across the flooded street,\
  \ I sank onto a stool and searched my bowl of ph\u1EDF for answers as fellow bikers\
  \ pulled on ponchos and tied shopping bags around their shoes. A curious server\
  \ approached and asked \u201Cyou drive, too?\u201D It was a simple question and\
  \ yet so much rested on my response. Moments like these define the kind of traveler,\
  \ and person, we choose to be. Realizing I had come too far to flee, I prepared\
  \ for the long road ahead with newfound resolve.\n\nTwo frigid days passed before\
  \ reaching the final serpentine slope cloaked thickly in fog, which I climbed with\
  \ caution. As I crested the peak the air began to clear, as if by the hill-dwelling\
  \ gods themselves, bringing the surreal landscape into full focus. I ran once again\
  \ towards the edge of a cliff, but this time loss was replaced with discovery and\
  \ dread with pure wonder. Impossibly green mountains flecked with jagged limestone\
  \ rose and fell dramatically on all sides, while a silken mist ebbed and flowed\
  \ between their peaks like tides. A rich earthen musk cleared my mind and filled\
  \ me with swelling gratitude, provoking a chilled teardrop to tumble silently off\
  \ my chin. It was this moment that had led my unconscious compass here, through\
  \ mental turmoil and physical discomfort, and I had the distinct sensation of arriving\
  \ home.\n\nSoaring effortlessly downwards, my body leaning intuitively into the\
  \ hairpin turns, I gave thanks for the weird and wonderful journey I was on. Without\
  \ losing everything I wouldn't have found myself here."
