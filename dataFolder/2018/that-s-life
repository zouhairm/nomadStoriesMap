Text: "After inserting the four-quarters in the tollbooth, I checked my passport and\
  \ cellphone were secure in my side pocket for the third time. Then, out of mere\
  \ routine, checked my back pocket where my wallet would usually be before crossing\
  \ the international bridge. I wasn't entering an alien country; it had just been\
  \ so long since last time I had visited Matamoros by my self, on foot, and late\
  \ in the afternoon. \nThe last time I visited was on Christmas, but my father drove\
  \ us across the Brownsville & Matamoros International Bridge fast and straight to\
  \ my grandmother's house. This time I was crossing the Gateway International Bridge,\
  \ which leads directly to an important avenue of the Mexican border town called\
  \ Alvaro Obregon. \nDuring our holiday visit, I didn't get to smell of the food\
  \ stands on the side of the hectic avenue selling tacos and corn on the cob. Also,\
  \ I wasn't asked for spare change by small children and again by a mean-looking\
  \ man that observed how I handed some coins to the children. He straight up asked\
  \ if I had some more cash to spear, but when I said no he left murmuring ills of\
  \ me. I didn't give it much thought after I saw he approached other evident tourists.\n\
  I doubled down my pace and promised myself not to stop until I arrived at my destination.\
  \ Soon I began regretting not having brought my earphones which would've made it\
  \ feel less rude to ignore the taxi drivers that politely attempted to earn my business.\
  \ \"No, gracias,\" I said half a dozen times declining their offers to take me to\
  \ my destination for a reasonable price.\nIn no time I was in front of a generic\
  \ drug store with two entrances, one to the drug store and the other lead to a small\
  \ waiting area where a mother and daughter were patiently waiting for the doctor.\
  \ I took a seat and joined them in their waiting. As I scanned the room and its\
  \ temporary habitats, I right away recognized the logo on the sweater the girl was\
  \ wearing; it was the logo of a charter school from Brownsville. \nI felt more at\
  \ ease knowing I was not the only \"gringo.\" I pondered how easy it was for us\
  \ living on the border to access cheap medical attention. My questioning led to\
  \ a more profound reality: what about the millions of low-income families that live\
  \ in the U.S.? I then questioned my nation's healthcare system which to me, is banking\
  \ on peoples sickness. The last thing I expected from this trip was to become an\
  \ activist pushing for universal healthcare in the U.S. But that's life."
