Text: "It all began one morning in Sai Ying Pun, a bustling suburb of Hong Kong Island.\
  \ It is barely 5am but bare chested couriers pull carts of dried abalone and cordyceps\
  \ fungus. They pile the boxes against shops hugging the length of Des Voeux Road\
  \ West, or dried seafood street. I can still smell the fish maws swinging from hooks\
  \ in the barely moving breath of the still too humid summer. It is there listening\
  \ to the drum beat of the maw that I stand with my boyfriend. We are there to flag\
  \ a cab that will take him to the airport and back to his native Mexico after a\
  \ nine-month project in Asia. As I sniff back silent tears he says, I\xB4m never\
  \ returning here and you\xB4re too selfish to give up your life in Hong Kong, so\
  \ this is where we say goodbye for good. Fast forward 18 months and I am stood in\
  \ Benito Juarez airport in Mexico City with three cases, ready to begin a new life\
  \ in Latin America. This could be the craziest way anyone has ever tried to prove\
  \ somebody wrong. But as I meandre among the hip boutiques of Roma weeks later something\
  \ happens that makes me realise I made the right choice. Waiting to cross Chapultapec\
  \ I glance sideways and see a man staring intently at my feet. I shift my toes awkwardly\
  \ in my dusty sandals. The staring stranger speaks in broken English and asks me\
  \ where I am from. Do you have a job here he enquires? Or a boyfriend? I laugh uncomfortably\
  \ but still I reply that yes I am employed but no I do not have a boyfriend. Are\
  \ you interested in meeting rich, handsome men he asks. I think he is joking and\
  \ so I laugh as I respond, \xB4claro, siempre\xB4. But his expression doesn\u2019\
  t change and keeping one eye on my feet he rummages around in his leather holdall\
  \ to retrieve a camera. Can I take a photo of your \xB4pies\xB4 he asks. They are\
  \ bonita. Really I reply doubtfully. He tells me he runs an on-line business that\
  \ introduces rich, handsome, men to the feet of women. There is no cost for las\
  \ mujeres he reassures me, los hombres shoulder the cost of subscription. I decide\
  \ this is getting a bit weird and tell him that an introduction agency for men with\
  \ foot fetishes is not really for me. But over the next few weeks I think about\
  \ this exchange a lot because this characterises the wonder of Mexico City, the\
  \ many and totally unexpected ways conversations begin with strangers. And the difference\
  \ it makes to feeling an attachment to a place, to a city, to a home. Especially\
  \ when you moved 8,773 miles across the world just to provde an ex-boyfriend wrong."
