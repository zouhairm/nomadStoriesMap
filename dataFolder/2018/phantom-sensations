Text: "He woke up at the same time each night like clockwork. His eyes rolled back\
  \ as he propped himself upright. Each attempt at adjusting his comfort level reminded\
  \ him of meat grinding against bone. The tiniest breath made his face burn. All\
  \ alone. No one to hear him yelp with hysteria. The hollow echoes of hunger pains\
  \ & nausea bubbled uncomfortably in his abdomen. Having achieved a tortured happy\
  \ medium level of comfort, he painfully exhaled. Broken cigars and brown grogue\
  \ did their best to keep annoyances to a minimum. The pain was building again. Grabbing\
  \ one of the smaller pillows, he angrily lifted the sheets to blank space and phantom\
  \ sensations. No shattered limbs, just stubs that bounced to nonexistent muscle\
  \ memory. Choking on air, he softly wept at the sight of his lower half and his\
  \ feelings of despair. All alone in a foreign land & in a body that no longer felt\
  \ like his own. Feeling on edge, he chased some pills down with some grogue & passed\
  \ out.\n\nHe\u2019s startled awake by the knock on, opening of his bedroom door.\
  \ \u201COl\xE1?\u201D, the delicate voice called out. He opened his eyes to see\
  \ Minga standing at the foot of the bed. She\u2019d become his only local connection\
  \ to life on these islands. They\u2019d met on one of his rare trips to the local\
  \ market and she decided to befriend him. \u201C\xC9 um novo dia hoje Gruit! Como\
  \ devemos gostar?\u201D, she inquired. \u201CSeja o que quiser, querida.\u201D,\
  \ he responds. She smiled feeling proud at his language development over the past\
  \ few weeks. Bringing his chair around, she helped Gruit get ready for the day\u2019\
  s adventure. He was grateful for her persistent insistence of not wanting him to\
  \ be a surly, self pitying reclusive expat.\n\nThe fresh air revitalized his body.\
  \ Pushing past the Santiago tourists traps and merchants, they made their way to\
  \ the the docks. To his surprise & delight, Minga decided they were going fishing.\
  \ Gruit was touched that she\u2019d remembered his tales of good times & tradition\
  \ shared between the men in his family. He was even more impressed that she was\
  \ willing to board a ship after her freakish boating experience the previous summer.\
  \ As she pushed him up the ramp, he tilted his head back and smiled at her wryly.\
  \ She winked in kind. It was during that quiet exchange that he realized he felt\
  \ somewhat at peace. His pain diminished to a whisper. Thanks to their friendship,\
  \ he no longer felt alone and she finally felt needed. It truly was the last thing\
  \ either of them expected and everything they both needed."
