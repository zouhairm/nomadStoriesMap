Text: I boarded the general compartment of a train from Agra.Somehow my grandfather
  managed to get a seat.I stood there thinking what to do and then tried to sit on
  the floor away from the toilet until my grandfather scolded me to sit beside him
  in a very little space.After some time the crowd lessened and it was only then I
  could notice a short girl curled up beside the window staring into the dark night.I
  went to sit beside her and eventually began talking to her. Her name was Rani, she
  was in her late teenage years even though she looked smaller than that and her native
  place is a village in Bihar.She was the only daughter to her parents.She has four
  elder brothers.We talked more and I found out that she was returning home after
  attending her cousin's wedding in Delhi (old). Then I asked her about her education
  and came to know that she dropped out of school after 9th standard,then went to
  study stitching and started working but her elder brothers stopped her from going
  to work.I was astonished to see her happy face while she said that, she regarded
  the denial as their love for her and not their ego. I felt horrible at how illiterate
  women regard patriarchy as love or else they are molded to believe it that way.
  To add some spice to my horror I knew that she is engaged and will be married soon.I
  tried my best to make her understand the importance of education, how women in our
  country are seen as inferior to men and how she should speak up against all the
  odds holding her back to achieve something.She tells me that she hopes her future
  husband will allow her to continue her studies.Then again I become distressed at
  how women are made to believe that they need permission to pursue a career but secretly
  in my mind even I was praying that her husband would allow her because it's hard
  to make her realize anything within a limited time.We were now close to reaching
  her destined station and I bid her farewell.That night I watched her get down and
  disappear into the dark night.It was almost 11:00 pm and we had to kill two more
  hours to reach New Delhi.I leaned back in my almost empty seat, the feminist inside
  me poisoned with guilt as I was helpless and couldn't do anything for her.I don't
  know if I was able to make even a slight change in her thoughts.I still think about
  that night and pray that I will be able to see all women educated and independent
  in India in the near future.
