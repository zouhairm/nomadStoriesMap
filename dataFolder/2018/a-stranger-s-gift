Text: "It was our sixth month travelling through North America on our motorcycles,\
  \ and, after spending a week in the home of a free spirited adventurer in Tuscon,\
  \ it was time to move on. With a sad goodbye, we rode off into the desert. \n\n\
  Arizona showed off its beauty under the vaporizing heat of the sun, seemingly at\
  \ one with our perpetual forward movement along a beautiful track. I rode across\
  \ a dry creek bed and held my breath as I crossed a narrow section, cliff standing\
  \ tall on my left, a sheer drop into the canyon below on my right. Only to be confronted\
  \ by a steep descent littered with large boulders. A technical descent that zapped\
  \ the last of my energy in the afternoon sun. I rounded a blind corner at the bottom\
  \ to find my husband stopped dead at a locked gate. We could see the highway but\
  \ we could not get to it. Energy expended, I sat on the track as tears began to\
  \ form. Just for a moment. \n\nThe only way out was back along three technical,\
  \ bone jarring kilometres. It was already 5.30pm and those first three kilometres\
  \ would take us two hours to ride. Pushing on, we finally found the bitumen in the\
  \ last dying rays of the sun. We were hot and sweaty. My tear streaked face hidden\
  \ under a thick layer of Arizona dust. \n\nWe were soon sat on the kerb at a brightly\
  \ lit gas station, eating chocolate and drinking icy soda. It was 8pm and dark and\
  \ we had nowhere to camp for the night, nor the budget to stay the only hotel near\
  \ by. Our morale was low when suddenly a man pushed something crinkled and papery\
  \ into my hand. He had been invisible to me until that point, but I watched him\
  \ walk back to his clean car and drive away into the darkness. I turned to my hand,\
  \ slowly unclasping my fist. There sat something that returned the light to my heart.\
  \ \n\nA crumpled $1 bill. Many thoughts swam through our minds as to what this man\
  \ had been thinking and why he had given this small, but unbeknownst to him, priceless\
  \ gift. A kind act that made us feel connected to humanity.\n\nOur spirits boosted,\
  \ we rode into the darkness, soaking in the beauty of a vast and silent desert.\
  \ We camped by a river that night. But we found more than just a campsite. We found\
  \ a story that taught us how much a stranger can impact your life with a simple\
  \ gift of kindness. Each time we faced difficulties on our 18 month adventure, we\
  \ recalled this story and received its gift again.\n\nI never dreamed that a stranger\
  \ in a gas station and his $1 bill would teach me such a powerful life lesson."
