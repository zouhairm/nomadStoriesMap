Text: "The ride up the Fernsehturm Tower was just like any other ride up to the top.\
  \ Popping ears and the bizarre, but well-known, weightless sensation we feel when\
  \ the elevator slowly lands with leisure in the air. But for an explanation unknown,\
  \ that feeling of my body\u2019s grasp missing gravity didn\u2019t fade.\n\nWithin\
  \ a few seconds of stepping off of the elevator, something supernal overcame me.\
  \ \n\nI took a moment to think of the many observation decks I\u2019ve experienced.\
  \ The Montparnasse tower in Paris where the Eiffel Tower\u2019s Green Lawn is in\
  \ perfect perspective. Tibidabo in Barcelona where one could spend a lifetime counting\
  \ the colorful rooftops. The London Eye where a golden Big Ben compensates for a\
  \ dusty River Thames. St. Pierre\u2019s cathedral in Geneva where Jet d\u2019 Edu\
  \ sings against the Swiss Alps. The A\u2019dam Tower where I took a ride on Europe\u2019\
  s highest swing with the sun above me and Amsterdam below me. I\u2019ve been up\
  \ more than that too, but I just can\u2019t think of them all right now. \n\nI actually\
  \ can\u2019t think of anything right now.\n\nThis view I\u2019m looking at isn\u2019\
  t even pretty. Berlin is not pretty. It is not charming. \n\nIt\u2019s just another\
  \ city. A huge, sterile, cold city.\n\nA city with repetitious orange rooftops and\
  \ perfectly painted black roads. I\u2019ve heard Germans are punctual, and the reiterative\
  \ imagery that I\u2019ve brought myself to doesn\u2019t argue with that convention.\
  \ In fact, I come to the conclusion that it delineates it. \n\nI stare down at Berlin\
  \ depicted below me. The sun shines some fresh light in my face as I look over the\
  \ clockwork-like trains traveling, and all of the monuments so grand when above\
  \ me, but now from the top, so microscopic below me. \n\nGrowing up, I had an irrational\
  \ fear of heights. And now, wherever I go, I crave to climb to the highest point\
  \ I possibly can. I have found a profound sense of comfort in doing so, and can\
  \ only seek this serenity when I am closer to the clouds. \n\nI have moved all of\
  \ my life, and I have never lived in one place for long. It seems I\u2019ve been\
  \ incessantly searching for a place to call home. But here at the top of this tower,\
  \ I now understand. That my home is not a house. It is not a community. It is not\
  \ familiarity. It is up in the air. It is uncertain calamity in setting foot on\
  \ foreign land. \n\nIt is these moments, when you are embodied with such unexpected\
  \ surprise, that make you appreciate the view from the top that much more. To the\
  \ point where you can\u2019t imagine ever having to come down."
