Text: "I opened my notebook, words strikethrough representing the daily basis of an\
  \ artist. The old man next to me squinted surreptitiously. I reacted like all writers\
  \ in a public place \u2013 especially in an airplane where the cruising altitude\
  \ is 39, 32,000 feet and there's no escape \u2013 cover my letters with my hands.\n\
  He asked if I like to write. I replied: \"I'm a writer.\"\nWhen you grow up on a\
  \ small island everyone knows each other and if not, it's like you know a friend\
  \ of a friend of a relative of a cousin of your classmate. That's how things work\
  \ in Puerto Rico. \n\"Are you on vacation or coming back?\" He seemed like an adorable\
  \ grandpa I never had the chance to meet. \"Vacation. It's been more than a decade\
  \ since I left. Kinda feels that way.\"\nI was excited to travel back to the country\
  \ who saw me take my first steps. Javier, who introduced himself in a moment of\
  \ turbulence, was heading back because of his grandson's wedding in San Juan, capital\
  \ of Puerto Rico. \nA part of me wanted to go back to my writings, but I decided\
  \ it could wait.  While the stewardess provided refreshments and snacks, I told\
  \ him what writing means to me: a way to heal the soul when the doctors themselves\
  \ tell you there's no cure.  \n\"You know what I like about writers?\" I asked him\
  \ what. \"Secrets,\" he replied, \"each word is a sacred place where people should\
  \ fear whether or not to go. He confessed to having written many poems when he was\
  \ young. Then asked me about mine.\nI could've said many things hidden in my writings,\
  \ but instead, I asked him if he knew about Snow White? He laughed casually and\
  \ nodded. I told him when I was a newborn I was the only girl in the nursery alongside\
  \ seven boys, for what the nurses decided to called us Snow White and The Seven\
  \ Dwarfs. \"It's weird how on every birthday I think where are these guys? Like\
  \ 'hey, we hung out at the nursery!\"  \n\"You want to meet these guys?\" I nodded.\n\
  Turned out I met one of the dwarfs through a photo, Javier's grandson; an engineer\
  \ who plays guitar. Javier then asked for a photo so his grandson could meet 'Snow\
  \ Tan'. I agree, asking why 'Snow Tan'. He said my skin color was beautiful and\
  \ all writers have a pure personality like the snow.  \nJavier and I spoke during\
  \ the whole trip and laughed at the jargon of the people who live in the metro and\
  \ on the 'island', where simplest things like empanadillas o pastelillos are the\
  \ same. I love the laugh behind the wrinkles. Javier's a treasure who touched my\
  \ soul for life."
