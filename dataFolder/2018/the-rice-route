Text: "Our faces were flushed pink when finally reach camp. Kids, running home from\
  \ school, wave at Mai as we approached. Routine. \n\nMai is a local. She walks this\
  \ trek every day-- five hours up and down the rolling hills of SaPa and five hours\
  \ back. She often leaves before her son goes to school and returns just after he\
  \ comes home. \"It's simple life,\" she assures us. We aren't sure if she knows\
  \ just how right she was--in comparison to us, at least. Those of us on the tour\
  \ are used to the hustle and bustle of North American life-- are suddenly jerked,\
  \ forced to reexamine the frivolousness of our daily lives. The contrast. How unnecessary\
  \ much of it is. How privileged we are. \n\nThat was three years ago-- and still,\
  \ to this day, I never eat rice without thinking about Mai.\n\nStreet vendors littered\
  \ the colorful streets of the SaPa village -- a town aptly named the Vietnamese\
  \ Alps. Mai leads us through a forest-- and we soon see why. Rice terraces stretch\
  \ for miles, plunging valleys were coupled with towering mountains and rolling peaks.\
  \ Over the next few hours, you could hear our bated breaths-- both from exhaustion\
  \ and the natural and effortless beauty of a place less travelled. Wild water buffalos\
  \ roam free, grazing the terraces-- the only life except for the teams of farmers\
  \ tending to their crop. \"We work as a team,\" Mai explains. \"We help each other\
  \ plant the rice so we all can maximize the growth.\" You can feel the sense of\
  \ unity. Community. \n\nTwo hill tribes dominate the valley-- the Black Hmong and\
  \ the Red Dzao. They wear their respective colors. Mai, who is sporting a red hand-sown\
  \ armband, waves to her tribal members; all easily identified by red. \n\nFinally,\
  \ while hearing our heartbeats in our throat, we arrive. It was a long and hard\
  \ trek, but we're content, ready for a good night's sleep. The men can be seen walking\
  \ home from the fields. Kids are laughing, playing tag as the women usher them home--\
  \ some carrying babies in a kangaroo-like sack, slung across their backs. There\
  \ is no air conditioning and the only form of shower is a large tub. Most of us\
  \ are far too tired to bother washing tonight-- which is quite ridiculous considering\
  \ all we did was walk. Everyone else had a hard day's work in the fields. Fighting\
  \ back yawns, we finally sit down for dinner. It's a local cuisine, which of course\
  \ features rice. Five hours later we now understand a tad better: each and every\
  \ grain of rice takes hours of hard labor. We enjoy it a little more now."
