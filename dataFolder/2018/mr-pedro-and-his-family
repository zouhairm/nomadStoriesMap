Text: "On the last day of a trip that had begun 4 weeks ago in the south of Chile/Argentina\
  \ we headed towards a mountain in the surroundings of Coyhaique, we took the only\
  \ possible way up to the top. At first there were many houses, businesses and tourist\
  \ attractions, suddenly the population was falling; After advancing several miles\
  \ without seeing anything but dense vegetation we reached the end of the road. There\
  \ you could see beautiful landscapes and great tranquility, when we were about to\
  \ return we found an old house that belonged to Mr.Pedro and his family.\nHe was\
  \ a 70-year-old local man who lived with his wife and took care of a couple of small\
  \ grandchildren as well as many animals, as is usual in these areas people greet\
  \ each other and this was no exception, Mr.Pedro riding his horse came to us and\
  \ said with his southern accent: Hello, what brings you to the top of this mountain?\
  \ This was the beginning of a wonderful friendship and the day I most remember of\
  \ that trip.\nThe sun hits hard in these places, due to the hole in the ozone layer,\
  \ you could see the effects of UV rays on the face of Mr.Pedro and his wife Julia,\
  \ covered in scars and sunspots, they looked older than what they really are, and\
  \ their hands are devastated by life in the countryside, with many cuts and calluses\
  \ produced by the care of the animals and the planting of fruits and vegetables,\
  \ the children lived in Ays\xE9n and were spending their vacations with their grandparents.\n\
  We arrived at lunch, his house was covered with moss and had a pleasant smell of\
  \ earth and wood a little wet, we were very lucky to taste the flavors of Julia's\
  \ food, prepared with real ingredients, harvested by herself from the garden , after\
  \ lunch we talked about our lives, she told us that they live in the mountains since\
  \ the 70's and that they only go down to the town to make some purchases or due\
  \ to a medical issues in her husband's old red truck.\nWe were impressed by their\
  \ life at the top of the mountain and their lack of daily technologies like internet\
  \ or phones, they liked our clothes and could only imagine what it was like to live\
  \ in a big city, it was a mutual admiration because they usually do not receive\
  \ visitors and a couple like Mr.Pedro and Julia is very strange to find in modern\
  \ times.\nIn a few hours, a lunch and a couple of cups of mate we found great people\
  \ and friends for a lifetime, 3 years have passed since that trip, I hope to be\
  \ able to return some day and that Mr.Pedro and his family are fine."
