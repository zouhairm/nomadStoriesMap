Text: "When I was trying to get a word from the Indian teacher, I recalled I was told:\
  \ \u201CNever trust an Indian\u201D. Ana understood everything. \u201CHow wouldn\u2019\
  t she get the accent? She is English! My Spanish mother tongue is not helpful...\u201D\
  \ I was lost in my mind when a soft voice brought me to Earth: Do you like chocolate?\
  \ Which cake shall we have? Ana asked me. We were in Mcleod Ganj, Dharamsala, at\
  \ a curious patisserie, with tasty cakes and second-hand clothes from charity Centres.\
  \ The ideal ambiance: yummy deserts, comfy tables, delightful smell that makes your\
  \ mouth water, some original attires and light that gives the place such a romantic\
  \ view that you instantly want to go in. A fine spot to give birth to a long-life\
  \ friendship on the other side of the Globe: In Dalai Lama\u2019s home, two young\
  \ eastern women from different sides talking for the first time on their lives,\
  \ in what it was my second language. We were so excited of being in the inner-peace,\
  \ yoga and meditation\u2019s land to do a Yoga Teacher Training. Could it be a better\
  \ place? Ana and I were certain: This world\u2019s corner was The Place. \nThe following\
  \ day in The Place occurred the last thing I expected: In front of the Ashram we\
  \ saw what looked as a big snowball rolling quick and violently in the middle of\
  \ the sand: Two men dressed in bare white outfits rolling on the floor together\
  \ like Siamese, making such furious movements it seemed they were going to kill\
  \ each other. A heavy scene especially because of the 2 men involved: The 2 chiefs\
  \ of the 2 main Yoga schools. Ana and I were enlisted in one of them. Once again\
  \ my mind: \u201CNever trust an Indian\u201D. My thoughts in high volume this time:\
  \ They are Indian Yoga Teachers. How can this happen here? I choose this spot over\
  \ hundreds! Ana knew my worries and asked if I will leave. I did want to, but then\
  \ what would I learn from that? Running from a place I choose myself will not give\
  \ anything to my life. I told Ana: I always trust myself which is why I came here.\
  \ There is something else to learn in this place and I aim to know what it is, I\
  \ will grasp far deep from the fight, the odd people and the accent. I will stay\
  \ and catch. And you? \nLater we found the battle was about which of the schools\
  \ would keep the new students. Crazy! But in that time Indians also taught me about\
  \ happiness under any circumstance. These people made me aware it is not the place,\
  \ but the experience which offers us the most useful lessons when traveling. By\
  \ the way, you can trust some Indians."
