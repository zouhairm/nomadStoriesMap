Text: "Well, dear reader, it is precisely in the moment between the joy of the celebration\
  \ and the realization of travel planning that sometimes the difficulties take the\
  \ license and present themselves without the least ceremony. As the Symposium Brazil-Germany\
  \ it was an event shared with European researchers that most inconvenient limitation\
  \ extends the hand and says:\n\"Hello, how are you? Do not you remember me? I am\
  \ [your almost intimate] financial constraint!'.\nHere we were getting the \"mean$$\"\
  \ required to embark on the trip. Well, it was a tribulation. We held raffles supported\
  \ by the entire UFPI economy department and friends. In the midst of it all we got\
  \ the promise of a friend's lodging. Well, some things got better and we were able\
  \ to take care of our trip.\nOn 09/28/2017, I and Cashew left my parents' house\
  \ to catch our flight to Santar\xE9m. Still in the airport we met with two friends\
  \ - one of them was the one who had gotten the lodging friend. We took the same\
  \ flight and in the early evening, after some turbulence in the middle of the rivers\
  \ and the Amazon forest, we arrived in Santar\xE9m.\nWell, these details may seem\
  \ unnecessary to you who want to know what happened in Peru, Colombia or anywhere\
  \ in the backpack published here. But, my dear reader, it is precisely the details\
  \ of this life that make the maturity to support itself, because there is nothing\
  \ more firm and solid than the experience guided by the events lived in our constant\
  \ journey.\nIt was after 07:00pm when we landed in that city of Amazonian heart\
  \ and arteries irrigated by the Tapaj\xF3s River. Four enthusiastic college students\
  \ at such an interesting event in a heavenly place. We just think about getting\
  \ better and starting to figure it all out.\nAfter getting our bags, we went to\
  \ the airport door and soon we saw a truck with several colleagues of the friends\
  \ who were next to us from Bethlehem. We are presented briefly and, to our surprise,\
  \ the girl who drove the pickup says goodbye and invites our friends to leave.\n\
  That's right, I'll explain this last paragraph better to make it clear. We had a\
  \ link that had given us a place to stay, and that link was one of the two friends,\
  \ fellow travelers. But, due to some major fault (which is the cousin of some difficulties),\
  \ the owners of the place did not know us and ignored the possible existence of\
  \ accommodation. In fact, the closest of a reception that we could receive from\
  \ them was the name of three hotels that we could resort to to stay."
