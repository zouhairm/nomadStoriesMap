Text: "The three boys behind the counter laughed as they tossed dirty rags to and\
  \ fro, wiped coffee spills, rattled dishes, and rang up people\u2019s orders in\
  \ between. Our first week of study abroad classes in Queretaro, Mexico, and serendipity\
  \ was at play. Coffees in hand, my classmates and I found an open caf\xE9 table,\
  \ pulled out our books, and dove into Spanish conjugations, not thinking twice about\
  \ the boys behind the counter.\n\nThe next day, we entered our new University through\
  \ the blue tiled courtyard. My friend Kelsey halted. \u201CThe boys from the coffee\
  \ shop!\u201D she exclaimed pointing ahead. Sure enough, the three boys from the\
  \ day before sat together, noses in books, just a few steps away from us. \n\nOver\
  \ the next four months, that coffee shop connection led to friendship. Beto broke\
  \ up with a long time girlfriend. Max invited us to his family home for drinks and\
  \ food. And Sunshine (a nickname from his sunny California, surfer hairstyle) quit\
  \ working at the coffee shop, to take care of his sick mother. We walked through\
  \ daily life with these boys, between waiting for each other after classes, salsa\
  \ nights, and even rock climbing.\n\nOne late night at the caf\xE9, my friend Cheryl\
  \ and I waited for Max to finish his shift. Scrolling through Facebook, Cheryl found\
  \ out a friend from high school passed away unexpectedly. She broke down, sliding\
  \ to the dirty floor, still damp with coffee spills. Max stopped wiping counters\
  \ and we quickly joined her. A heavy conversation followed, but Max\u2019s perspective\
  \ allowed our views to shift and see life as a celebration.\n\nJust around the corner\
  \ that fall, Dia de los Muertos unfolded- another opportunity to learn and connect.\
  \ At the end of October, La Calavera Catrina, an elegantly dressed skeleton, comes\
  \ to life in drawings, sculptures, candy, and costumes. Families light candles and\
  \ display bright yellow flowers to celebrate the lives of people who passed away.\
  \ Through these traditions, once more my perspective of life and death changed.\n\
  \nA few weeks later my grandmother died, cutting my study abroad experience in Mexico\
  \ short as I flew back to the USA. A bittersweet time, I found peace in my Grandmother\u2019\
  s passing through talking with Max personally and learning from the locals about\
  \ Dia de los Muertos. On a study abroad experience where I was determined to learn\
  \ Spanish, I walked away a changed person in deeper ways and am grateful for the\
  \ connections I made in serendipitous coffee breaks and traditional holidays."
